            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

This considered; hearing (madam) of the passions your Ladiship hath vttered a late for the losse of your husband, a Knight in life worshipfull, vertuous, and full of honourable thoughts; discouering by such passionate sorowes the patterne of a louing and vertuous wife, whose ioyes liued in hir husbands weale, and ended with his life, I thought it my dutie to write this pastorall historie, conteyning the manifolde iniuries of fortune, that both your Ladiship might see her inconstant follies, and beare hir frownes with more patience, and when your dumpes were most deepe, then to looke on this little treatise for recreation: wherein there be as well humors to delight, as discourses to aduise. Which if your Ladiship shall vouch to accept, couering my presumption and faultes which your wonted courtesie; I haue the wished end of my labors. In which hope resting, I commit your Ladiship to the Almightie.

               IT fareth with mee Gentlemen, as with Batillus the ouer bold poet of Rome, that at euerie winke of Caesar would deliuer vp an hundred verses, though neuer a one plausible, thinking the Emperours smile a priuiledge for his ignorance: so I hauing your fauor in letting passe my Pamphlets, feare not to trouble your patience with many works, and such as if Batillus had liued, hee might well haue subscribed his name to. But resting vpon your fauors I haue thus farre aduentured to let you see Camillas alarum to Euphues, who thought it necessarie not to let Euphues censure to Philautus, passe without requitall. If Gentlemen you finde my stile either magis humile in some place, or more sublime in another, if you finde darke Aenigmaes or strange conceipts as if Sphinx on the one side, and Roscius on the other were playing the wagges; thinke the metaphors are well ment, and that I did it for your pleasures, whereunto I euer aymed my thoughts: and desire you to take a little paines to prie into my imagination. Wherein if you shall rest inine, I shall euer as I haue done rest yours; and so I bid you farewell.

               COme foorth you witts that vaunt the pompe of speach,
               And striue to thunder from a Stage-mans throate:
               Uiew Menaphon a note beyond your reach;
               Whose sight will make your drumming descant doate:
               Players auant, you know not to delight;
               Welcome sweete Shepheard, worth a Schollers sight.
            
            
               
                  Smirna is drie, and Helicon exhal'd,
               
                  Caballian founts haue left their springing sourse,
               
                  Parnassus with his Lawrell stands appal'd;
               And yet His Muse keepes on her wonted course:
               Wonted said I? I wrong his paines too much,
               Since that his pen before brought foorth none such.
            
            
               One writes of loue, and wanders in the aire;
               Another stands on tearmes of trees and stones:
               When heauens compare yeeldes but the praise of faire,
               And christ all can describe but flesh and bones:
               Yet countrey swaynes, whose thoughts are faith and troth,
               Will shape sweete words of wooll and russet cloth.
            
            
               Mongst whom if I my Tityrus should chuse,
               Whose warbling tunes might wanton out my woes;
               To none more oftner would my solace vse,
               Than to his Pastoralls their mortall foes.
               Sweete verse, sweete prose, how haue you pleasde my vaine?

               CVrteous and wise, whose iudgements (not entangled with enuie) enlarge the deserts of the Learned by your liberall censures; vouchsafe to welcome your scholler-like Shepheard with such Vniuersitie entertainement, as either the nature of your bountie, or the custome of your common ciuilitie may affoord. To you he appeales that knew him ab extrema pueritia, whose placet he accounts the plaudite of his paines; thinking his daie labour was not altogether lauisht sine linea, if there be anie thing of all in it, that doth olere atticum in your estimate. I am not ignorant how eloquent our gowned age is growen of late; so that euerie moechanicall mate abhorres the english he was borne too, and plucks with a solemne periphrasis, his vt vales from the inkhorne: which I impute not so much to the perfection of arts, as to the seruile imitation of vainglorious tragoedians, who contend not so seriouslie to excell in action, as to embowell the clowdes in a speach of comparison; thinking themselues more than initiated in poets immortalitie, if they but once get Boreas by the beard, and the heauenlie bull by the deaw-lap. But herein I cannot so fully bequeath them to follie, as their idiote art-masters, that intrude thē
               selues to our eares as the alcumists of eloquence; who (moū

            Arcadia.
            The reports of the Shepheards.
            
               AFter that the wrath of mightie Ioue, had wrapt Arcadia with noysome pestilence, in so much that the ayre yeelding preiudiciall sauors, seemd to be peremptory in some fatall resolution. Democles soueraigne and King of that famous Continent pitying the sinister accidents of his people, being a man as iust in his censures as royall in his possessions, as carefull for the weale of his country, as the continuance of his diadem, thinking that vnpeopled Cities were Corasiues to Princes consciences, that the strength of his subiects was the sinnews of his dominious, and that euery crowne, must conteyne a care, not onely to winne honour by fortayne conquests, but in 
                  〈◊〉
                dignitie with ciuill and domestical insights: Democles grounding his arguments vpon these premisses, coueting to be counted Pater Patriae, calling a Parliament together, whether all his Nobilitie incited by summons made their repaire, elected two of his chiefe Lordes to passe vnto Delphos, at Apollos Oracle to heare the fatall sentence, either of their future miserie or present remedie. They hauing their charge, posting from Arcadia to the Tripos where Pithia sate, the sacred Nymph that deliuered out Apollos Dylonimas,
                offering as their manner is their orizons &amp; presents, as wel to intreate by deuotion, as to perswade by 
                  〈◊〉
               , they had returned from Apollo this doome.
            
               When Neptune riding on the Southerne seas
               shall from the bosome of his Lemman yeeld
               Th' arcadian wonder, men and Gods to please:
               Plentie in pride shall march amidst the field,
               Dead men shall warre, and vnborne babes shall frowne,
               And with their fawchens hew their foemen downe.
            
            
               
                  When Lambes haue Lions for their surest guide,
               and Planets rest vpon th' arcadian hills:
               When swelling seas haue neither ebbe nor tide,
               When equall bankes the Ocean margine fills.
               Then looke Arcadians for a happie time,
               And sweete content within your troubled Clyme.
            
            No sooner had Pithia deliuered this scroll to the Lordes of Arcadie, but they departed and brought it to Democles, who causing the oracle to be read amongst his distressed commons, found the Delphian censure more full of doubts to amaze, than fraught with hope to comfort; thinking rather that the angrie God sent a peremptorie presage of ruine, thā a probable ambiguitie to applaud any hope of remedie: yet loath to haue his carefull subiects fall into the balefull laborinth of despaire, Democles began to discourse vnto them, that the interpreters of Apollos secretes, were not the conceipts of humane reason, but the successe of long expected enents; that Comets did portend at the first blaze, but tooke effect in the dated bosome of the destinies; that oracles were foretold at the Delphian Caue, but were shapte out and finished in the Counsell house. With such perswasiue arguments Democles appeased the distressed thoughtes of his doubtful countrimen, and commanded by proclamation that no man should prit into the quiddities of Apollos answere, least sundrie censures of his diuine secrecie, shoulde trouble Arcadia with some sodaine mutinie. The King thus smoothing the heate of his cares, rested a melancholy man in his Courts; hiding vnder his head the double faced figure of Ianus, as well to cleare 
                  〈◊〉
                skies of other mens conceiptes with smiles, as to furnish out his owne 
                  〈◊〉
                with thoughts. But as other beasts leuell their lookes at the countenance of the Lion, and birdes make wing as the Eagle flyes: so Regis ad arbitrium totus componitur orbis: the people were measured by the minde of the souereigne, and what stormes soeuer they smoothed in priuate conceipt, yet they made haye,

and cried holiday in out ward appearance: insomuch that euerie man repaired to his owne home, and fell either vnto pleasures or labours, as their liuing or content allowed them.
            Whiles thus Arcadia rested in a silent quiet, Menaphon the Kings Shepheard, a man of high account among the Swaines of Arcadie, loued of the Nymphes, as the paragon of all their countrey youngsters, walking solitarie downe to the shore, to sée if any of his ewes and lambes were straggled downe to the strond to brouse on sea iuie, wherfore they take speciall delight to féede; he found his flockes grazing vpon the Promontorie Mountaines hardlie: whereon resting himselfe on a hill that ouer-peered the great Mediterraneum, noting how Phoebus fetched his Laualtos on the purple Plaines of Neptunus, as if he had meant to haue courted Thetis in the royaltie of his roabes: the Dolphines (the swéete conceipters of Musicke) fetcht their carréers on the calmed waues, as if Arion had touched the stringes of 
                  〈◊〉
                siluer sounding instrument: the Mermaides thrusting their heades from the bosome of Amphitrite, sate on the mounting bankes of Neptune, drying their waterie tresses in the Sunne beames. Aeolus forbare to throwe abroad his gustes on the slumbering browes of the Sea-God, as giuing Triton leaue to pleasure his Queene with desired melodie, and Proteus libertie to followe his flockes without disquiet.
            
               Menaphon looking ouer the champion of Arcadie to see if the Continent were as full of smiles, as the seas were of fauouts, sawe the shrubbes as in a dreame with delightfull harmonie, and the birdes that chaunted on their braunches not disturbed with the least breath of a fauourable Zephirus. Seeing thus the accord of the Land and Sea, casting a fresh gaze on the water Nimphs, he began to consider how Venus was feigned by the Poets to spring of the froathe of the Seas; which draue him straight into a deepe coniecture of the inconstancie of Loue: that as if Luna were his

load-starre, had euerie minute ebbes and tides, sometime ouerflowing the banks of Fortune with a gracious look lightened from the eyes of a fauorable louer, otherwhiles ebbing to the dangerous shelfe of despaire, with the piercing frowne of a froward Mistresse. Menaphon in this browne studie, calling to minde certaine Aphorismes that Auarreon had penodowne as principles of loues follies, being as déepe an enemie to fancie, as Narcissus was to affection, began thus to scosfe at Venus Deitie.

Loue Menaphon, why of all follies that euer Poets fained, or men euer faulted with, this foolish imagination of loue is the greatest: Venus forsooth for her wanton escapes must be a Goddesse, &amp; her bastard a Deitie: Cupide
               
must be yong and euer a boy to prooue that loue is fond and witlesse, wings to make him inconstant, and arrowes whereby to shew him feareful: blinde (or all were not worth a pinne) to prooue that Cupides leuell is both without aime and reason: thus is the God, and such are his Uotaries. As soone as our shepheards of Arcadie fettle themselues to fancie, and weare the characters of Venus stampte in their forheads, straight their attire must bee quaint, their lookes full of amours, as their Gods quiuer is full of arrowes; their eyes holding smiles and teares, to leape out at their Mistres fauours or her frownes: sighes must flie as figures of their thoughts, and euerie wrinckle must be tempred with a passion: thus suted in outward proportion, and made excellent in inward constitution, they straight repaire to take viewe of their Mistres beautie. She as one obseruant vnto Venus principles, first tieth loue in her tresses, and wraps affection in the tramels of her haire; s

               fluence, or some fauourable aspect. If a wrinckle appeare in her brow, then our shepheard must put on his working day face, &amp; frame nought but dolefull Madrigalls of sorrowe; if a dimple grace her cheeke, the heauens cannot prooue fatal to our kinde hearted louers; if she séeme coy, then poemes of death mounted vppon déepe drawne sighes, flie from their master to sue for some fauour, alledging how death at the least may date his miserie: to be briefe, as vppon the shoares of Lapanthe the winds continue neuer one day in one quarter, so the thoughtes of a louer neuer continue scarce a minute in one passion; but as Fortunes globe, so is fancies seate variable and inconstant. If louers sorrowes then be like Sisiphus turmoyles, &amp; their fauours like honnie bought with gall; let poore Menaphon then liue at labour, and make estéeme of Venus as of Mars his concubine; and as the Cimbrians hold their idols in account but in euerie tempest, so make Cupide a God, but whē thou ar

                        In fading pleasures that doo paine.

                        That minutes ioyes are monthlie woes.

                        That is sweete
                        Nowhere, but where repentance growes.

Chaunce is like Ianus double faced, as well full of smiles to comfort, as of frownes to dismay: the Ocean at his deadest ebbe returns to a full tide; when the Eagle meanes to soare highest, hee raiseth his flight in the lowest dales: so fareth it with fortune who in her highest extreames is most vnconstant: when the tempest of her wrath is most fearfull, then looke for 
                  〈◊〉
               ; when she beates thee with nettle, then thinke she will strewe thee with roses; when shee is most familiar with furies, her intent is to be most prodigall Sephestia. Thus are the arrowes of Fortune feathered with the plumes of the bird Halcione, that changeth colours with the Moone, which howsoeuer she shootes them pierce not so deepe but they may bee cured. But Sephestia thou art daughter to a King, exiled by him from the hope of a crowne, vanisht from the pleasures of the Court to the painfull fortunes of the countrey, parted for loue from him thou caust not but loue, from Maximus Sephestia, who for thee hath susfered so many dissauours, as either discontent or death can affoord. What of all this, is not hope the daughter of time? Haue not starres their fauourable aspects, as they haue froward opposition? Is there not a Iupiter as there is a Saturne? Cannot the influence of smiling Venus, stretch as farre as the frowning constitution of Mars? I tell thee Sephestia, Iuno foldeth in her brows the volumes of the 
                  〈◊〉
               ; whom melancholie Saturne deposeth from a Crowne, she 
                  〈◊〉
                aduanceth to a Diadem;

then feare not, for if the mother liue in miserie, yet hath the 
                  •
                scepter for the sonne: let the vnkindnesse of thy father be buried in the cinders of obedience, and the want of Maximus be supplied with the presence of his pretie babe, who beeing too young for Fortune, lies smiling on thy knee and laughs at Fortune: learne by him Sephestia to vse patience, which is like the balme in the Uale of Iehosaphat, that findeth no wound so déepe, but it cureth: thou seest alreadie Fortune begins to change her view, for after the great storme that rent our shippe, we found a calme that brought vs safe to shore; the mercie of Neptune was more than the enuie of Aeolus, and the discurtesie of thy father is proportioned with the fauour of the Gods. Thus Sephestia being copartner of thy miserie, yet do I seeke to allay thy martyrdome: beeing sicke to my selfe, yet do I play the Phisition to thee, wishing thou maist beare thy sorrowes with as much content, as I brooke my misfortunes with patience. As hee was readie to goe forwarde with his perswasiue argument, Sephestia fetching a déepe sigh, filling her tender eyes with teares, made this replie.
            Sweete Lamedon, once partner of my royalties, now partaker of my wants, as constant in his extreame distresse, as faithfull in higher fortunes: the Turtle pearketh not on barren trees. Doues delight not in foule cottages, the Lyon frequents no putrified haunts, friends followe not after pouertie, nor hath sinister chance anie drugges from the Phisitians, Nullus ad amissas ibit amicus opes: and yet Lamedon the misfortune of Sephestia abridgeth not our olde contracted amitie, thou temperest her exyle with thy banishment, and she sayling to Styx, thou ferriest ouer to Phlegeton: then Lamedon, saying as Andromache sayd to Hector Tu Dominus, tu vir, tu mihi frater eris.
                Thy aged yeres shalbe the calender of my fortunes, and thy gray haires the Paralells of mine actions. If Lamedon perswade Sephestia to content, Portia shall not exceede Sephestia in patience; if he will her to keepe a low sayle, she will vayle al her

shéete; if to forget her loues, shee will quench them with labours; if to accuse Venus as a foe, I wil hate Cupide as an enemie; and seeing the Destinies haue driuen thee from a 
                  ••
               owne, I will rest satisfied with the Countrey, placing all my delights in honouring thee, &amp; nursing vp my pretie wanton. I will imagine a small cotage to a spacious pallaice, &amp; thinke as great quiet in a russet coate, as in royall habilliments: Sephestia Lamedon will not scorne with Iuno to turne hir self into the shape of Semeles nurse, but vnknowne rest carelesse of my fortunes: the hope of times returne shal be the ende of my thoughts, the smiles of my sonne shall bee the nourishment of my hart, and the course of his youth shall be the comfort of my yeres; euerie laughter that leapes from his lookes, shall be the holiday of my conceiptes, and euerie teare, shal furnish out my greeues, and his fathers funerals. I haue heard them say Lamedon, that the lowest shrubbes feele the least tempests, that in the valleis of Affrica is heard no thunder, that in countrey roomes is greatest rest, and in little wealth the least disquiet: dignitie treadeth vpon glasse, and honour is like to the hearbe Synara, that when it bloometh most gorgeous, then it blasteth: Aulica vita 
                     ••••
                  ndida miseria, Courts haue golden dreames, but cotages sweet slumbres: then Lamedon will I disguise my self, with my cloathes I will change my thoughts; for being poorelie attired I will be meanelie minded, and measure my actions by my present estate, not by former fortunes. In saaying this the babe awakte and cride, and she fell to teares mixed with a lullabie.

The Topace being throwne into the fire burneth straight, but no sooner out of the flame but it freezeth; strawe is soone kindled, but it is but a blaze; and loue that is caught in a moment, is lost in a minute: giue me leaue then Menaphon first to sorrow for my fortunes, then to call to minde my husbands late funeralls, then if the Fates haue assigned I shall fancie, I will account of thee before anie shepheard in Arcadie. This conclusion of Samela draue Menaphon into such an extasie for ioy, that he stood as a man metamorphozed; at last calling his senses together, hee tolde her he rested satisfied with her answere, and therupon lent her a kisse, such as blushing Thetis receaues from her choycest lemman. At this Lamedon awakte, otherwise Menaphon no doubt had replied, but breaking off their talk they went to view their pastures, and so passing downe to the place where the sheepe grazed, they searched the shepheards bagges, and so emptied their bottles as Samela meruailed at such an

                but of the new shepheardesse. One daye amongst the rest, it chaunced that Doron sitting in parley with another countrey companion of his, amidst other tattle, they prattled of the beautie of Samela.

                her browes full of wrinckles, and her eyes full of furie, turned her backe, and shooke me off with a Non placet. Thus in loues I lost loues, and for her loue had lost all, had not when I neere despaired the clemencie of some

               , quoth Doron? As well as my musique replied Melicertus; for if Pan and I striue, Midas being Iudge, and should happe to giue me the garland, I doubt not but his Asses eares should be doubled: but Doron so long we dispute of loue, and forget our labours, that both our flockes shall be vnfolded, and tomorrow our merrie meeting hindered. Thats true quoth Doron, for there will be all the shepheards Daughters and countrey Damzels, and amongst them feare not but Menaphon will bring his faire Shepheardesse, there Melicertus shalt thou see her that will amate all our moodes, and amaze

thee, and therefore good Melicertus let vs be going. With this prattle away they went to their foldes, where we leaue them, &amp; returne to Menaphon, who trium phing in the hope of his new loues, caused Samela to tricke her vp in her countrey attire, and make her selfe braue against the meeting: she that thought, to be coye were to discouer her thoughts, drest her selfe vp in Carmelas russet cassocke, and that so quaintly, as if Venus in a countrey peticoate had thought to wanton it with her louely Adonis. The morow came, and away they went, but Lamedon was left behinde to keep the house. At the houre appointed, Menaphon, Carmela and Samela came, when all the rest were readic making merie. As soone as word was brought, that Menaphon came with his newe Mistres, all the companie began to murmur, and euery man to prepare his eye for so miraculous an

               : but Pesana a heardsmans daughter of the same parish, that long had loued Menaphon, and he had filled her browes with frownes, her eyes with furie, and her heart with griefe; yet coueting in so open an assemblic, as well as shee coulde to hide a pad in the straw, she expected as others did the arriwall of her newe corriuall: who at that instant came with Menaphon into the house. No sooner was she entred the Parlour, but her eyes gaue such a shine, &amp; her face such a brightnesse, that they stood gazing on this Goddesse; and shee vnacquainted, seeing 
                  〈◊〉
                selfe among so manie vnknowen swaines, died her cheekes with such a vermilion blush, that the countrey maides themselues fel in loue with this 
                  〈◊〉
                Nimph, and could not blame Menaphon for being ouer the shooes with such a beautifull creature. Doron iogde Melicertus on the elbowe, and so awakte him out of a dreame, for he was deeply drownd in the contemplation of her excellencie; sending out 
                  〈◊〉
                of sighs in remembrance of his old loue, as thus hee sate meditating cn her fauour, how much she resembled her that death had depriued him off: well her welcome was great of all the companie, &amp; for that she was a stranger they graced her to make her the 
                  〈◊〉
                of the Feast. Menaphon seeing Samela thus

honoured, conceiued no smal content in the aduancing of his Mistres, being passing ioconde and pleasant with the rest of the companie, insomuch that euerie one perceiued howe the poore swayne fedde vppon the dignities of his Mistres grates. Pesana noting this began to lowre, and Carmela winking vpon her fellowes, answered her frownes with a smile, which doubled her griefe; for womens paines are more pinthing if they be girded with a frumpe, than if they be galled with a mischiefe. Whiles thus there was banding of such lookes, as euerie one imported as much as an 
                  impreso, Samela willing to see the fashion of these countrey yong frowes, cast her eyes abroad, and in viewing euerie face, at last her eyes glaunced on the lookes of Melicertus; whose countenance resembled so vnto her dead Lord, that as a woman astonied she stood staring on his face, but ashamed to gaze vppon a stranger, she made restraint of her looks, and so taking her eye from one particular obiect, she sent it abroad to make generall suruey of their countrey demeanours. But 
                  〈◊〉
                all this gazing, he that had seene poore Menaphon, how infected with a iealous furie, he stared each man in the face, fearing their eyes should feede or surfet on his Mistres beautie: if they glaunst, he thought straight they would be riualls in his loues; if they flatlie lookt, then they were déepely 
                  〈◊〉
                in affection; if they once smiled on her, they had receyued some glance from Samela that made them so malepart; if she laught, she likte; and at that he began to frowne: thus sate poore Menaphon all dinner while pained with a thousande 
                  〈◊〉
                passions, keeping his téeth garders of his stomacke, and his eyes watchmen of his loues, but Melicertus halfe impatient of his new conceiued thoughts, determined to trie how the Damzell was brought vp, and whether she was as wise as beautifull, hee therefore began to breake 
                  〈◊〉
                thus.
            The Orgies which the Bacchanals kept in Thessaly, the Feasts which the melancholy Saturnists

Then quoth Melicertus; by your leaue since I was first in motion, I will be first in question, &amp; therefore new come shepheardesse first to you: at this Samela blusht, and he began thus.
            Faire Damzel, when Naereus chatted with Iuno, he had pardon, in that his prattle came more to plesure the Goddesse than to ratifie his owne presumption: if I Mistres be ouerhold, forgiue me; I question not to offend, but to set time frée from tediousnesse. Then gentle shepheardesse tell me, if you should bee transformed through the anger of the Gods, into some shape; what creature would you reason to be in forme? Samela blushing that she was the first that was

               , yet

               gathered vp her crums, and desirous to shew her pregnaunt wit, (as the wisest women be euer tickled with self loue) made him this answere.
            Gentle shepheard, it fits not strangers to be nice, nor maidens too coy; least the one feele the weight of a scoffe, the other the fall of a frumpe: pithie questions are mindes whetstones, and by discoursing in iest, manie doubts are deciphered in earnest: therefore you haue forestalled me in crouing pardon, when you haue no néede to feele anie grant of pardon. Therefore thus to your question; Daphne I remember was turned to a bay tree, Niobe to a flint, Lampetia &amp; her sisters to flowers, and sundrie Uirgins to sundrie shapes according to their merites; but if my wish might serue for a 
                  〈◊〉
               , I would be turned into a sheepe. A sheepe, and why so Mistres? I reason thus quoth Samela, my supposition should be simple, my life quiet, my food the pleasant

Plaines of Arcadie and the wealthie riches of Flora, my drinke the coole streames that flowe from the concaue 
                  〈◊〉
                of this Continent, my aire should bee cleere, my walkes spacious, my thoughts at ease, and can there none shepheard be my better premisses to conclude my replie than these? But haue you no other allegations to confirme your resolution: Yes sir quoth she, and farre greater. Then the law of our first motion quoth hee commands you to repeate them. Farre be it answered Samela that I should not doo of free will anie thing that this pleasant companie commands: therefore thus; Were I a shecpe, I should bee garded from the foldes with iollie Swaines, such as was Lunas Loue on the hills of Latmos; their pipes sounding like the melodie of Mercurie, when he lulld asleepe Argus: but more, when the Damzells tracing along the Plaines, should with their eyes like Sunne bright beames, drawe on lookes to gaze on such sparkling Planets: then wearie with foode, shoulde I lye and looke on their beauties, as on the spotted wealthe of the richest Firmament; I should listen to their sweete layes, more sweete than the Sea-borne Syrens: thus feeding on the delicacie of their features, I should like the Tyrian heyfer fall in loue with Agenors darling. I but quoth Melicertus, those faire facde Damzells oft draw foorth the kindest sheepe to the shambles. And what of that sir aunswered Samela, would not a sheepe so long 
                  〈◊〉
                with beautie, die for loue. If he die (quoth Pesana) it is more kindnes in beasts, than constancie in men: for they die for loue, when larkes die with leekes. If they be so wise quoth Menaphon, they shew but their mother witts; for what sparkes they haue of inconstancie, they drawe from their female fosterers, as the Sea dooth ebbes and tides from the Moone. So be it sir answered Pesana, then no doubt your mother was made of a 
                  〈◊〉
                cocke, that brought foorth such a wauering companion: for you master Menaphon measure your looks by minutes and your loues are like lightning, which no sooner flash on the 
                  〈◊〉
               , but they vanish. It is then quoth Menaphon because

mine eye is a foolish Iudge, and chooseth too baselie: which when my heart censures of, it 
                  〈◊〉
                away as refuse. Twere best thē said Pesana, to discharge such vniust Iudges of ther seates, and to set your eares

                they fault quoth Melicertus, euerie market towne hath aremedie, or els there is neuer a Baker néere by seauen miles. Stay curteous Shepheards quoth Samela, these iestes are too broade before, they are cynicall like Diogenes quippes, that had large feathers and sharpe heads, it little fits in this companie to bandie taunts of loue, seeing you are vnwedded and these all maidens addicted to 
                  〈◊〉
               . You speake well as a Patronesse of our credite quoth Pesana, for in

                we be 
                  〈◊〉
               , &amp; addicted to virginitie. Now quoth Menaphon that you haue got a virgin in your mouth you wil neuer leaue chaunting that word, till you prooue your selfe either a Uestall or a Sybill. Suppose she were a Uestall quoth Melicertus, I had almost said a virgine (but God forbidde I had made such a doubtfull supposition) shee might carrie water with Amulia in a siue: for amongst all the rest of the virgins we read of none but her that wrought such a miracle. Pesana hearing how pleasantly Melicertus plaid with her nose, thought to giue him as great a bone to gnaw vppon, which she cast in his teeth thus 
                  〈◊〉
               .
            I remember sir that Epicurus measured euerie mans diet by his owne principles; Abradas the great Macedonian Pirate, thought euerie one had a letter of Marte, that bare

                in the Ocean; none came to knocke at Diogenes tub but was supposed a Cinick; and fancie a late hath so tied you to his vanities, that you will thinke Vesta a flat figured conceipt of Poetrie. Samela perceiuing these blowes woulde growe to déepe wounds, broke off their talke with this prety digression. Gentlemen, to end this strife, I praye you let vs heare the opinion of Doron, for all this while neither he

               Carmela haue vttered one word, but sate as Censers of our pleas; twere necessarie he tolde vs how his heart came thus on his halfepenie. Doron hearing Samela thus pleasaunt,

made presentlie this blunt replie; I was faire Mistres in a solempne doubt with my selfe, whether in beeing a sheepe, you would be a Ram or an Ewe: An Ewe no doubt quoth Samela, for hornes are the heauiest burden that the head can beare. As Doron was readie to replie, came in sodainly 
                  〈◊〉
                this parley foure or fiue olde shepheards, who broke off their prattle, that from that they fel to drinking: and so after some parley of their flocks, euerie one departed to their own home where they talked of the exquisite perfection of Samela, especially Melicertus, who gotten to his owne cotage, and lyen downe in his couch by himselfe, began to ruminate on Samelas shape.
            Ah Melicertus, what an obiect fortune this day brought to thy eyes, presenting a strange Idaea to thy sight, as appeared to Achilles of his dead friend Patroclus, tresses of gold like the tramels of Sephestias lockes, a face fairer than Venus, such was Sephestia; her eye paints her out Sephestia, her voyce sounds her out Sephestia, she séemeth none but Sephestia: but seing she is dead, &amp; there liueth not such another Sephestia, sue to her and loue her, for that it is either a selfe same or another Sephestia. In this hope Melicertus fel to his slumber, but Samela was not so content: for shee began thus to muse with her selfe; May this Melicertus be a shepheard: or can a countrie cotage affoord such perfection? doth this coast bring forth such excellence? then happie are the virgins shall haue such suters, and the wiues such pleasing husbands; but his face is not inchacte with anie rusticke proportion, his browes containe the characters of nobilitie, and his lookes in shepheards weeds are Lordlie, his voyce pleasing, his wit full of gentrie: weigh all these equallie, and consider Samela is it not thy Maximus? Fond foole away with these suppositions; could the dreaming of Andromache call Hector from his graue? or can the vision of my husband raise him from the seas? Tush stoop not to such vanities: hee is dead, and therefore grieue not thy memorie with the imagination of his new reuiue, for there hath been but one Hippolitus
               
found to be Virbius, twise a man, to salue Samela than this suppose; if they court thee with hyacinth,

                them with roses; if he send thee a lambe, prese

               t him an eawe; if he wooe, be wooed; and for no other reason, but, hee is like Maximius. Thus she rested, and thus she slept, all parties being equally content and satisfied with hope except Pesana, who fettred with the feature of her best beloued Menaphon sate cursing Cupide as a partiall Deitie, that would make more daye light in the Firmament than one Sunne, more rainebowes in the heauen than one Iris, &amp; more loues in one heart than one settled passion: manie praiers she made to Venus for reuenge, manie vowes to Cupide, manie orizons to Hymaeneus, if shee might possesse the type of her desires. Well poore soule, howsoeuer she was paid, she smothered all with patience, and thought to braue loue with séeming not to loue; and thus she daily droue out the time with labour, &amp; looking to her heard, hearing euerie day by Doron who was her kiusman, what successe Menaphon had in his loues. Thus Fates and Fortune dallying a dolefull Catastrophe, to make a more pleasing Epitazis, it fell out amongst them thus. Melicertus going to the fields, as he was wont to doo with his flockes, droue to graze as néere the swaines of Menaphon as he might, to haue a view of his new enterteined Mistres; who, according to his expectation came thether euerie day. Melicertus esteeming her to bee some Farmers daughter at the most, could not tell how to court her: yet at length calling to rembrance her rare wit discouered in her last discourses, finding opportunitie to giue her both bal and racket, se

            Mistres of al eyes that glance but at the excellence of your perfection, soueraigne of all such as Venus hath allowed for louers, Oenones ouermatch, Arcadies comet, beauties second comfort; all haile: seeing you sit like Iuno when shee first

                your sweete selfe in the shade, and affoord you such companie as a poore swaine may yeeld without offence; which if you shall vouch to deigne of, I shall be as glad of such accepted seruice, as Paris first was of his best beloued Paramour. Samela looking on the shepheardes face, and seeing his vtterance full of broken sighes, thought to bee pleasant with her shepheard thus. Arcadies Apollo, whose brightnesse draws euerie eye to turne as the Heliotropion 
               
                  〈◊〉
                after her load; fairest of the shepheards, the Nimphes sweetest obiect, womens wrong, in wronging manie with ones due; welcome, and so welcome, as we vouchsafe of your seruice, admitte of your companie, as of him that is the grace of al companies; and if we durst vpon any light pardon, woulde venter to request you shew vs a cast of your cunning. Samela made this replie, because she heard him so superfine, as if Ephaebus had learnd him to refine his mother tongue, wherefore thought he had done it of an inkhorne desire to be eloquent; and Melicertus thinking that Samela had learnd with Lucilla in Athens to anotamize wit, and speake none but Similes, imagined she smoothed her talke to be thought like Sapho Phaos Paramour. Thus deceiued either in others suppositions, Samela followed her sute thus; I know that Priamus wanton could not be without flockes of Nymphes to follow him in the Uale of Ida, beautie hath legions to attende her excellence if the shepheard be true; if like Narcissus you wrap not not your face in the cloude of disdaine, you cannot but haue some rare Paragon to your Mistres, whome I woulde haue you in some sonnet describe. Ioues last loue, if Ioue coulde get from Iuno, my pipe shal presume and I aduenture with my voice to set out my Mistres fauour for your excellence to censure of, and therefore thus. Yet Melicertus for that 
                  〈◊〉
                had a farther reach, would not make anie clownish description, chanted it thus cunningly.

                           How oft haue I descending Titan seene
                           His burning lockes couch in the Sea-queenes lap,
                           And beauteous Thetis his red bodie wrap

                           And lent each starre a more than Delian light.
                        
                        
                           Not Ioue or Nature should they both agree
                           To make a woman of the Firmament,
                           Of his mixt puritie could not inuent
                           A Skie borne forme so beautifull as she.
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            When Melicertus had ended this roundelay in prayse of his Mistres, Samela perceiued by his description, that either some better Poet than himselfe had made it, or else that his former phrase was dissembled: wherefore to trie him thoroughly, and to see what snake laye hidden vnder the grasse, she followed the chase in this manner.
            
               Melicertus, might not a straunger craue your Mistres name. At this the shepheard blusht, and made no reply. How

now quoth Samela, what is she meane that you shame, or so high as you fear to bewray the souereign of your thoughts? Stand not in doubt man, for be she base, I reade that mightie Tamberlaine after his wife Zenocrate (the worlds faire eye) past out of the Theater of this mortall life, he chose stigmaticall trulls to please his humorous fancie. Be she a princesse, honour hangs in high desires, and it is the token of a high minde to venter for a Queene: then gentle shepheard tell me thy Mistres name. Melicertus hearing his goddesse speake so fauourably, breathed out this sodaine replie; Too high Samela, and therefore I feare with the Syrian Wolues to barke against the Moone, or with them of Scyrum to shoot against the starres; in the height of my thoughts soaring too high, to fall with wofull repenting Icarus: no sooner did mine eye glance vpon herbeautie, but as if loue and fate had sate to forge my fatall disquiet, they trapte mee within her lookes, and haling her Idaea through the passage of my sight, placde it so déeply in the center of my heart, as maugre al my studious indeuour it still and euer will kéepe restlesse possession: noting her vertues, her beauties, her perfections, her excellence, and feare of her too high born parentage, although painfully fettered, yet haue I still feared to dare so haute 
                  〈◊〉
                attempt to so braue a personage; least she offensiue at my presumption, I perish in the height of my thoughts. This conclusion broken with an abrubt passion, could not so satisfie Samela but she would bee further inquisitiue. At last after manie questions, he answered thus; seeing Samela I consume my selfe, &amp; displease you; to hazarde for the salue that maye cure my malady, &amp; satisfie your question, know it is the beauteous Samela. Be there more of that name in Arcady beside my selfe quoth she. I know not qd Melicertus, but wer there a million, onely you are Melicertus Samela. But of a million qu

No quoth Samela, I meane by your selfe, for I haue hearte that your fancie is linked alreadie to a beautiful shepherdesse in Arcadie. At this the pore swaine tainted his cheeks with a vermilion die, yet thinking to carrie out the matter with a

Then quoth Samela taking him at a rebound, neither may I thinke your glaunces to be fancies, nor your greatest protestation any assurance of deepe affection: therefore ceasing off to court any further at this time, thinke you haue prooued your selfe a tall souldier to continue so long at batterie, and that I am a fau

Thus these Louers in a humorous descant of their prattle espied a farre off olde Lamedon and Menaphon comming towards them; whereupon kissing in conceipt, &amp; parting with interchaunged glaunces, Melicertus stole to his sheepe, and Samela sate her downe making of nets to catche birds. At last Lamedon and her Loue came, and after manie gracious lookes, and much good parley, helpte her home with her sheepe, and put them in the folds.

                for playing false playe at

nine holes: which she espying through her lattise window, could not chose but smile about measure. But when she saw him in his childish termes condemne one to death for despising the authoritie bequeathed him by the rest of the boyes, then she bethought her of the Persian Cyrus that deposed his Grandfather Astyages, whose vse it was at like age to imitate maiestie in like manner. In this distraction of thoughts she had not long time staid, but Lamedon and Menaphon calde her awaye to accompany them to the foldes, whiles Pleusidippus hasting to the execution of iustice, dismissed his boyish session till their next meeting: where how imperiously he behaued himselfe in punishing misorders amongest his equals, in vsing more than iesting iustice towards his vntamed copesmates, I referre it to the Annuals of the Arcadians that dilate not a little of this ingenious argument. In this sort did Pleusidippus draw foorth his infancie, till on a time walking to the shore, where hee with his mother were wrackt, to gather cockles and pebble stones, as children are wont: there arriued on the strond a Thessalian Pirate named Eurilachus, who after he had forraged in the Arcadian confines, driuing before him a large bootie of beasts to his ships espied this pretie infant; when gazing on his face as wanton Ioue gazed on Phrygian Ganimede in the fields of Ida, hee exhaled into his eyes such déepe impression of his perfection, as that his thought neuet thirsted so much after any pray, as this pretie Pleusidippus possession: but determining first to assay him by curtesie before hee assayled him with rigour, he began to trie his wit after this manner. My little childe, whence art thou, where wert thou borne, whats thy name, and wherefore wandrest thou thus all alone on the shoare. I pray ye what are you sir quoth Pleusidippus, that deale thus with me by interrogatories, as if I were some runne away. Wilt thou not tell me then who was thy father: Said he, Good sir, if ye will needes knowe goe aske that of my mother. Hath said wel my Lord quoth Romanio who was one of his especiall associates, for wise are the children in these

dayes that know their owne fathers, especially if they be begotten in Dogge daies, when their mothers are franticke with loue, &amp; yong men furious for lust. Besides, who knows not, that these Arcadians are giuen to take the benefit of euerie

Pseusidippus eyes at this speach resolued into fire, and his face into purple, with a more than common courage in children of his yeares and stature, gaue him the lie roundly in this replie; Pesant, the bastard in thy face, for I am a Gentleman: wert thou a man in courage, as thou art a Kowe in proportion, thou wouldst neuer haue so much empayred thy honestie, as to derogate from my honor. Look not in my face but leuel at my heart by this that thou seest, and therewith let driue at him with such pebble stones as hee had in his hat, insomuch that Romanio was driuen to his heeles, to shun this sodaine haile shot, and Eurilochus resolued into a laughter, and in tearmes of admiration most highly extolled so exceeding magnanimitie in so little a bodie; which how auaileable it prooued to the confirmation of his fancie, that was before inflamed with his features, let them imagine, that haue noted the imbecilitie of that age, and the vnresisted furie of men at armes. Sufficeth at this instant to vnfolde (all other circumstance of praise laid apart) that Eurilochus being farre in loue with his extraordinarie lineaments, awaited no farther parley, but willed his men perforce to hoyse him a shipboord, intending as soone as euer he arriued in Thessaly, by sending him to the Courte as a present, to make his peace with his Lord and Master Agenor, who not long before had proclaimed him as a notorious Pirate throughout all his dominions. Neither swarued hee one whit from his purpose, for no sooner had he cast auker in the Port of Hadrionopolis, but he arraied him in choyce silkes and Tyrian purple, &amp; so sent him as a prize to the King of that Country, who walwalking

as then in his summer garden with his Queen the beauteous Eriphila, fell to discourse (as one well séene in Philosophie) of hearbes and flowers, as the sauour or colour did occasion; and hauing spent some time in disputing their medicinable properties, his Ladie reaching him a Marigold, he began to moralize of it thus merely. I meruaile the Poets that were so prodig all in painting the amorous affection of the Sunne to his Hyacinth, did neuer obserue the relation of loue twixt him and the Marigold: it shoulde either séeme they were loath to incurre the displeasure of women, by propounding it in the way of comparison any seruile imitation for head strong wiues, that loue no precepts lesse, than those pertaining vnto duty; or that that flower not so vsual in their gardens as ours, in her vnacquainted name did obscure the honour of her amors to Apollo; to whose motions reducing the methode of her springing, she waketh and sleepeth, openeth and shutteth her golden leaues, as he riseth and setteth. Well did you forestall my exception quoth Eriphila, in terming it a seruile imitation; for were the condition of a wife so slauish as your similitude would inferre, I had as leaue be your page as your spouse, your dogge as your darling. Not so swéete wife answered Agenor, but the comparison holdeth in this, that as the Marigold resembleth the Sunne both in colour and forme, so each mans wife ought euerie way to be the image of her husband, framing her countenance to smile, when she sées him disposed to mirth; and contrariwise her eyes to teares, he being surcharged with melancholy: and as the Marigold displaieth the orient ornaments of her beautie to the resplendant viewe of none but her louer Hyperion, so ought not a woman of modestie lay open the allurements of her face to anie but her espoused pheere; in whose absence like the Marigold in the absence of the Simne, she ought to shut vp her dores, and solemnize continuall night, till her husband her sunne making a happie return, vnsealeth her silence with the ioy of his sight. Beléeue me, but if all flowers (quoth Eriphila) affoord such influence of eloquence to our aduerse orators,

He exempt them all from my smell, for feare they be all planted to poyson. Ofte haue I heard (replied Agenor) our cunning Phisitions conclude, that one poyson is harmelesse to another; which if it be so, there is no cause why a

                speachlesse astonishment, the faire childe Pleusidippus not vsed to such hyperbolical spectators, broke off the silence by calling for his victualls, as one whose emptie stomack since his comming from sea, was not ouercloyed with delicates, whereat Agenor reuiued from his trance, wherein the present wonder had inwrapt him, demanded such questions of his name and parentage as the Pirates ignorance could not vnfold; but he being able to tel no more than this, that his mother was a shepheardesse, &amp; his owne name Pleusidippus, cut off all their further interrogatories by calling after his childish manuer againe for his dinner. Whereupon Agenor commanding him to be had in, and vsed in euerie respect as the childe of a Prince, beganin his solitarie walke by his countenance to calculate his Natiuitie, and measure his birth by his beautie, contracting him in thought heyre to his kingdome of Thessaly, and husbande to his daughter, before he knewe whence the childe descended, or who was his father.
            But leauing yong Pleusidippus thus spending his youth in the Thessalian Court, protected with the tender affection of such a courteous Foster-father as Agenor; returne wee where we lefte backe vnto Arcadie, and meete his Mother the faire Samela returning from the foldes: who hauing discoursed by the way as she came home to Lamedon and Menaphon what shee late sawe and obserued in her sonne, they both conioyned their iudgements to this conclusion, that hee was doubtles borne to some greater fortunes than the sheepcoates could containe, and therefore it behooued her to further his Destinies with some good and liberall education,

and not to detaine him any longer in that trade of life, which his fortune withstood: but by the way to rebuke him for tyrannising so Lorlolie ouer the boies, least the neighbor shepheards might happely intrude the name of iniurie on them being strangers for his insulting ouer their children. With this determination came she home, &amp; calling for Pleusidippus according to their former counsaile, he would in no wise be found. Thereupon enquirie was made amongest all the shepheards, diligent search in euerie village, but stil the most carefullest post returned with Non est inuentus. Which Samela hearing, thinking she had vtterly lost him whome Fortune had saued, began in this manner to act her vnrest; Dissembling heauens, where is your happinesse? vnconstant times, what are your triumphes? haue you therefore hethertoo fed me with honie, that you might at last poyson me with gall? Haue you fatted mee so long with Sardenian smiles, that like the wracke of the Syrens, I might perrish in your wiles?

Yet might not all this preuaile with Samela, who constant to her olde shephearde, would not interteine anie new loue; which made Pleusidippus thinke all his haruest lost in the reaping, and blemisht al his delights with a mournful drooping. But Democles that lookt for a mountaine of golde in a Mole hill, finding her all alone, began to discourse his loue in more ample mauner thā euer Pleusidippus, telling her how he was a King, what his reuenewes were, what power he had to aduance her; with many other proud vaunts of his wealth, and prodigal termes of his treasure. Samela hearing the name of a King, &amp; perceiuing him to be hir Father, stoode amazed like Medusaes Metamorphosis, and blushing oft with intermingled sighes, began to thinke how iniurious fortune was to her showen in such an incestuous father. But he hot spurred in his purpose, gaue hir no time to deliberate, but required either a quicke consent, or a present deniall. She tolde him, that the Shepheard Melicertus was alreadie intitled in the interest of hir beautie, wherefore it was in vain what he or anie other could plead in the way of perswasion.

séeing Melicertus figure was so déepely printed in the center of her thoughts, as neither the resolution of his fancie, his Metamorphosis from a King to a traueler, Crownes, Kingdomes, preferments, (battries that soone ouerthrowe the fortresse of womens

Democles stepping amongst the route, demanded the cause of their controuersie. Marie sir quoth Doron bluntly, the flower of all our garland is gone.

Democles thinking to take opportunitie by the forhead: and seeing Time had feathred his bolte, willing to assaye as hee might to hit the marke, began thus.

               Samela, bouering in the eares of euerie man as a miracle of nature, brought me from Thessaly to féede mine eyes with Arcadies wonder: stepping alongst the shoare to come to same sheepcoate where my wearie limmes might haue rest, Loue that for my labors thought to lead me to fancies pauilion, was my conduct to a castle, where a Thessalian knight lyes in holde, the Portcullis was let downe, the bridge drawen, the Court of garde kept, thether I went; and for by my tongue I was known to be a Thessalian, I was enterteined and lodged: the Knight whose yeares are young, and valure matchlesse, holding in his armes a Ladie more beautifull thā Loues Queene, all blubbered with teares, asked me manie questions, which as I might I replide vnto: but while he talkt, mine eye surfetting with such excellence, was detained vpon the glorious shew of such a wonderfull obiect; I demanded what she was of the standers by, &amp; they said she was the faire shepheardesse whome the Knight had taken from the swaines of Arcadie, and woulde carrie with the first winde that serued into Thessaly: This shepheards I knowe, and grieue that thus your Ioues should be ouermatcht with Fortune, and your affections pulde backe by contrarietie of Destinie.

Well from words they had falne to blowes, had not the shepheards parted them; and for the auoyding of farther troubles, it was agreed that they should in two Eclogs make description of their loue, and Democles, for he was a stranger, to sit Censor, and who best could decipher his Mistres perfection, should be made Generall of the rest.

At this Menaphon grudged, and Melicertus was in an extasie for ioy; so that gathering all his forces together of stone headstrong clownes, amounting to the number of some two hundred, he apparailed himselfe in armour, colour sables, as mourning for his Mistres, in his shield he had figured the waues of the sea, Venus sitting on them in the height of all her pride. Thus marched Melicertus forward with olde Democles the supposed shepheard

till they came to the castle, where Pleusidippus and his faire Samela were resident. As soone as they came there, Melicertus begirt the Castle with such a siege, as so manie shéeyish Caualiers could furnish: which when he had done, summoning them in the Castle to parley, the yong Knight stept vpon the walls, and seeing such a crue of base companions, with Jackets and rustie bills on their backs, fell into agreat laughter, and began to taunt them thus.
            Why, what straunge Metamorphosis is this? Are the Plaines of Arcadie, whilome filled with labourers, now ouerlaide with launces? Are sheepe transformed into men, swaines into souldiers, and a wandring companie of poore shepheards, into a worthie troope of resolute champions: No doubt, either Pan meanes to playe the God of warre, or else these be but such men as rose of the téeth of Cadmus.

Samela standing on top of the turret, and viewing the combate; the poore Ladie grieuing that for her cause such a stratageme should arise in Arcadie, her countenance ful of sorrow, and flonds of teares falling from her eyes, she began to breath out this passion.

As still shee was about to goe forwarde in hir passion, the trumpet sounded and they fell to fight in such furious sorte, as the Arcadians and Democles himselfe wondered to see the courage of the Shepheard, that tied the Knight to such

               , and to feare the euent of the combate. On the contrarie parte, Melicertus halfe wearied with the heauie blowes of Pleusidippus, stoode in a maze howe so yong a wagge should be so expert in his weapon. Thus debating diuersly in their seueral thoughts, at length being both wearie, they stepte backe, and leaning on their swordes tooke breath, gazing each vpon other. At last Pleusidippus burst into these speaches.
            Shepheard in life, though now a Gentleman in armour, if thy degrée be better, I glorie I am not disgracde with the combate: tell me, how darest thou so farre wrong mee, as to wea

            Princockes (quoth Melicertus) thou liest, they bee mine owne, and thou contrarie to the Lawe of Armes bearest my Creast without difference, in which quarrell, seeing it concernes mine honour, I will reuenge it as farre as my loues; and with that he gaue such a charging blowe at Pleusidippus healme, that hee had almost ouerturned him: Pleusidippus

                not the blowe vnrequitted, but doubled his force; insomuch that the hazard of the battaile was doubtfull, and both of them were faine to take breath againe. Democles seeing his time, that both of them were sore weakened, gaue the watchword, and the ambush leapt out, slaughtered manie of the shepheards, put the rest to flight, tooke the two champions prisoners, and sacking the Castle, carried them and the faire Samela to his Court: letting the Shepheardesse haue her libertie, but putting Melicertus and Pleusidippus into a deepe and darke dungeon.
            Where leauing these passionate Louers in this Catastrophe, againe to Doron the homely blunt Shephearde; who hauing been long enamoured of Carmela, much good wooing past betwixte them, and yet little speeding; at last, both of them met hard by the Promontorie of Arcadie, shee

leading foorth her Sheepe, and hee going to see his newe yeand Lambes. As soone as they met, breaking a few quarter blowes with such countrey glaunces as they coulde, they geerde one at another louingly. At last Doron manfully begun thus.
            
               Carmela by my troth God morrow, tis as daintie to see you abroad, as to eate à messe of sweete milke in July: you are proude such a house doue of late, or rather so good a Huswife, that no man may see you vnder a couple of Capons; the Church-yeard may stand long inough

                           As dooth the shadow seuerd from his prime,
                           Seeming as though it were, yet neuer was.
                           Leauing hehinde nought but repentant thoughts
                           Of daies ill spent, for that which profits noughts.
                        
                        
                           Its now a peace, and then a sodaine warre,
                           A hope consumde before it is conceiude,
                           At hand it feares, and menaceth a farre,
                           And he that gaines is most of all deceiude:
                           It is a secret hidden and not knowne,
                           Which one may better feele than write vpon.
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            Thus Gentlemen haue you heard my verdite in this Sonetto, now will I returne to Doron and Carmela, who not seeing her mother come, fell againe to a few homely kisses, and thus it was.
            After they had thus amorously ended their Eclogues, they plighted faith and troth; and Carmela verie brisklye wiping her mouth with a white apron sealed it with a kisse, which Doron taking merueilous kindly, after a little playing loath to depart, they both went about their businesse. Leauing them therefore to their businesse, again to Democles; who seeing no intreaties would serue to perswade Samela to loue, neither the hope of the Arcadian Crowne, nor the title of a Queene, lastly assayed with frownes and threates, but all in vaine: for Samela first restrained by nature in that he was her Father, and secondly by loue in that Melicertus lay imprisoned onely for her sake, stoode still so

stiffe to her tackling, that Democles chaunging loue into hate, resolued to reuenge that with death, which no meanes els might satisfie: so that to colour his frauds withall, he gaue Samela free license to visite Melicertus: which she had not long done, but that by the instigation of the old King, the gailor confederate to his treacherie, accuseth her of adultetie: whervpon without further witnesse they both were contemned to dye. These two louers knowing themselues guiltlesse in this surmised faction, were ioyfull to ende their loues with their liues, and so to conclude all in a fatall and finall content of mindes and passions. But Democles set free Pleusidippus, as afraide the King of Thessaly would reuenge the wrong of his Knight, intertaining him with sumptuous banquets, as befitted so braue and worthie a Gentleman. The day came prefixed wherein these parties should die; Samela was so desirous to end her life with her friend, that she would not reueale either vnto Democles or Melicertus what she was; and Melicertus rather chose to die with his Samela, than once to name himself Maximius. Both thus resolued, were brought to the place of execution; and
                  •…
                
               Pleusidippus sitting on a scaffolde with Democles, séeing Samela come forth like the blush of the morning, felt an vncouth passion in his mind, and nature began to enter combate with his thoughtes; not loue but reuerence, not fancie but feare began to assaile him, that he turnd to the King, and sayd: Is it not pitie Democles, such diuine beautie should be wrapt in cinders: No quoth Democles, where the anger of a King must be satisfied. At this answere Pleusidippus wrapt his face in his cloake and wept, and all the assistants grieued to see so faire a creature subiect to the violent rage of fortune. Well Democles commaunded the deathsman to doo his deuoyre; who knéeling downe and crauing pardon, readie to giue Melicertus the fatall stroake, there slept out an olde woman attired like a Prophetesse, who cried out; Uillaine hold thy hand, thou wrongest the daughter of a King. Democles hearing the outcrie, and seeing that at

that word the people begun to mutinie and murmur, demanded the olde woman what she meant: Now quoth she, Democles is the Delphian

                performed; Neptune hath yéelded 
                  〈◊〉
                the worlds wonder, and that is young Pleusidippus nephew to thée, and sonne to faire Sephestia, who heere standeth vnder the name of Samela, cast vpon the Promontorie of Arcadie with her yong sonne, where shee as a shepheardesse hath liude in labours tempred with loues; her 
                  〈◊〉
                playing on the shore, was conueyed by certaine Pirates into Thessaly, where (when as he was supposed euerie waye to be dead) doing déedes of chiualrie, he fulfilled the prophecie: your highnesse giuing the Lyon, were guid vnto the lambs in dissembling your selfe a shepheard: planets resting vpon the hills, was the picture of Venus vpon their crests: &amp; the seas that had neither ebbe nor tide, was the combate twixte the father and the sonne, that gaue the waues of the seas in their shields, not able to vanquish one another, but parting with equall victorie. For know Democles this Melicertus is Maximius, twice 
                  〈◊〉
                to Sephestia, and Father to yong Pleusidippus: nowe therefore the Oracle fulfilled, is the happie time wherein Arcadie shal rest in peace. At this, the people gaue a great shout, and the olde woman vanisht. Democles as a man rauisht with an extasie of sodaine ioye, sate still, and stared on the face of Sephestia: Pleusidippus in all dutie leapt from his seate, and went and couered his mother with his 
                  〈◊〉
               , crauing pardon for the fondnesse of his incestuous affection: &amp; knéeling at his fathers feete submisse in that he had drawen his sword, &amp; sought his life that first in this world gaue him life. Maximius first looked on his wife, and seeing by the line aments of her face that it was Sephestia, fell about her necke, and both of them weping in the bosome of their sonne shed teares for ioye to see him so braue a Gentleman. Democles all this while sitting in a trance, at last calling his senses together, séeing his daughter reuiued, whom so cruelly for the loue of Maximius he had 
                  〈◊〉
                out his confines, Maximius in 
                  〈◊〉
               , and the childe

a matchles paragon of approued chiualrie, he leapt from his seate, and imbraced them all with teares, crauing pardon of Maximius and Sephestia: and to shew that the outward obiect of his watrie eies, had a sympathie with the inward passion of his hart, he impald the head of his yong neuew Pleusidippus with the crowne and diadem of Arcadie: and for that his brother Lamedon had in all distresse not lefte his daughter Sephestia, he toke the matter so kindly, that he reconciled himselfe vnto him, and made him Duke in Arcady. The successe of this forerehearsed Catastrophe growing so comicall, they all concluded after the Festiuall solemnizing of the Coronation (which was made famous with the excellent déedes of manie worthie Caualiers) to passe into Thessaly, to contract the mariage twixt Pleusidippus, &amp; the daughter of the Thessalian King. Which newes spred thorough Arcadie as a wonder, that at last it came to Menaphons eares; who hearing the high parentage of his supposed Samela, seeing his passions were too aspiring, and that with the Syrian wolues he barkt against the Moone, he lefte such lettice as were too fine for his lips, and courted his old loue Pesana, to whom shortly after he was married. And le
