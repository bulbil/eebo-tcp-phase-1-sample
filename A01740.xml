            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               ❧To the Worſhipfull his very good
Maiſter Edward Cope of Edon, Eſquier, Humfrey
Gifforde wiſheth many yeeres of proſperities.
            
               HAuing by your worſhips fauourable
permittance, conuenient
oportunity in your ſeruice, to
beſtow certain houres amongſt
my bookes, with which exerciſe
(of all earthly recreations I
am moſt delighted) both reaſō
bids me, and duety bindes me,
to make you partaker of ſome
of the fruits of my ſtudies. And
farther, your woorſhip being the onely maiſter that euer I
ſerued, vnto whom (my parentes excepted) I acknowledge
my ſelfe more bounde, then to al the worlde beſides, I might
be ſayde to carie a verie bad minde with me, if I ſhoulde not
endeuour by ſome one meanes or other, to ſhewe my ſelfe
thankefull for your benefites. And not knowing better
how to doe the ſame, I haue (amongſt other toies by me taken
in hand) made ſpeciall choice of theſe tranſlations enſewing,
to preſent you with, as a pledge of my loyaltie and teſtimonie
of the duetiful zeale that I beare yon. The firſt
thing that ſhall heerein bee offered to your view, is a moſte
excellent Epiſtle, written firſt in Italian by Maiſter Clodius
Ptholomoeus, which according vnto my ſimple ſkill, I
haue conuerted into Engliſh, although not with ſuche
eloquence as ſome other might (peradueuture) haue
done it: yet I truſt with ſuche diligence that yee ſhall
finde the intent of the Authour ſufficiently explaned. Hee
made it for the comforting of an acquaintaunce of his,

who beyng fallen into pouerty, did beare it very impaciently,
wherein he hath diſcharged the duety of a friend, ſo faithfully,
that no man can ſay ſo much in the commendation of
it, but that it will deſerue a greate deale more. An
                  •
               
what indifferent iudgement, it ſhall ſeeme too wante
of the prayſe that I geue it, ſhall appeare to come to paſſe
through the imperfection of the Tranſlator, and not any
default of the Authour, wohſe abilitie, if it ſhall not in all
poyntes anſweare to the willingneſſe of his mynde, meriteth
the rather too bee pardoned in that he hath done his
goodwil. Next vnto this Epiſtle followeth another of the
ſame mans compoſition, which for the occaſion, wherevppon
it was made, is not inferiour to the firſt. For the golden
examples and diuine ſentences that are cowched in
them, I chriſtened this diſcourſe by the name of A Comfortable
Recreation, nothing doubting but that whoſoeuer
ſhall peruſe it with aduiſed conſideration, will acknowledge
that what the Title doeth profeſſe in ſhewe, the treatiſe will
performe in ſubſtance. As the ylneſſe of my manner of handeling
of it was as it were a bridle to holde me backe from
geuing my conſent that it ſhoulde come foorth, ſo the
goodneſſe of the matter contayned in it, ſerued me as a
ſpurre to pricke me forwardes to yeelde to theyr entreaties
that craued to haue it publiſhed. Such other french
and Italian toyes as I haue tranſlated, and added heerevnto
(if I flatter not my ſelfe ouermuch in myne owne follies)
are ſuche as will bring more delight then diſliking
to the peruſers of them. I am to craue pardon for my preſumption
in dedicating them to your woorſhippe, which
I haue done, in that paſſing vnder the ſhadowe of your protection,
they ſhall of a number that know you, be receaued
with the greater fauour.
            Thus hoping that my welmeaning &amp; willing endeuour
ſhalbe conſtred in the beſt parte, remayning moſt thankefull
to your worſhip, for your benefits beſtowed on mee, I put an

end to my rud preface, wiſhing vnto &amp; you my miſtres, with
your little ones, and all other your welwillers, many yeeres
of proſperities. With humble and heartie interceſſion vnto
God, that as yee haue already planted a good and lawdable
beginning amongſt your neighbours, and liue in credit
in your countrey, with the loue and good liking of as
many as know you, that ſo yee may grow and goe forwardes
with dayly encreaſe of worſhippe, vntill
it ſhalbe his good pleaſure, that yee ſhall
exchaunge this earthly manſion,
for a heauenly habitation.
            
               Your ſeruaunt
Humfrey Gifford.
            
         
         
            
            To the Reader.
            
               CVrteous and friendly Reader, being
deſirous to content many, and
not giue occaſion of offence to any,
I haue ſuffered the importunacie
of ſom my welwillers to preuayle
ſo far with me, that I haue
yeelded them my conſent for the
publiſhing of this Treatiſe, not
being ignorant vnto what hazard
of reproch they oppoſe themſelues,
that permit their doings to be layde open to the view of a multitude.
For as the better ſort will pronounce their oppinions of
it, anſwerable to the veritie of the ſubſtaunce, that ſhalbe in the
workes contained: ſo the greater ſorte doe commonly giue their
verdit according to the vanitie of the ſurmiſes that ſhall by
them be conceaued: often kindling a kinde of miſlike with the
matter, for ſome ſecrete malice that they beare to the man: And
more oftener for a reſolute and ſetled determination that they
haue grounded in them, neuer to like well of any thing, vnleſſe it
meete iumpewtth their own doting and peeuiſh imaginations, or
be ſome pigge of their proper farrowing: being in this poynt not
vnlike the crow, who alwaies thinks her owne byrdes fayreſt. But
dayly examples teach vs, that they which vomitte forth the poyſoned
rancour of their malicious ſtomackes, againſt the lawdable
attemptes of others: moſt, are ſuch as of themſelues can doe
leaſt: who neither cary a minde to vndertake any commendable
exerciſe themſelues, nor haue a meaning to permit others that
would, to performe it without their venomous backbyting. If compariſons
were not odious, I woulde heere liken all ſuch whelpes of
Zoilus, to that crabbed and canckerly naturde curre, which
being layde vpon a bottle of hey, would neither feede of it himſelf,
(being meat contrary to his complection) nor ſuffer the poore
hungerſtarued beaſtes to approch neere it quietly: but would lye

still ſnapping and ſnarling at them. But to omitte theſe preambulations,
and come to the purpoſe, I tell thee (gentle Reader) if
thou wilt vouchſafe the ouerlooking of this comfortable recreation,
with a mind to profit, thou maiſt reape benefit, and be greatly
bettered by the reading of it. For the brydling and keeping
vnder of our diſordinate affections: for the reſtrayning and contayning
of our deſires within the compaſſe of a contented meane:
For the vſe and abuſe of riches, and for the gayning and obtayning
of the true and perfect tranquilitie of minde, one may reade
much, and yet not finde it more pithily and ſubſtantially ſette
downe, then in theſe Epiſtles following: And eſpecially in the firſt,
where thou ſhalt meete with ſuch plentie of ſweete and comfortable
conſolations, collected out of the 
                  •
               owelles of the ſcripture,
and applyed ſo aptly, as will mooue them, if thou haue neuer ſo little
taſt or feeling in them of God, or godlyneſſe, to minde thy creator,
and be thankefull vnto him for his benefits. And my hope
is, that the goodneſſe and excellencie of the matter ſhall ſo rauiſh
thy ſenſes that my imperfections in the tranſlating of them, ſhall
be paſt ouer by thee vneſpied. Neuertheles if either in the edition
of this, or other my trifles, any thing ſhal chaunce to eſcape mee,
which in thy vnpartial opinion ſhal ſeeme vnfitting, I will moſt
willingly ſubmit my ſelfe to the cenſure of thy iudgement, &amp; vppon
a
                  •
               monition amende the fault by repentance, yeelding thee
thankes for thy friendlineſſe, anſwerable to the minde and good
meaning that I ſhal ſee thee to aduertiſe me of it. 
                  •
               ut if I ſhal
perceaue thee to ſpeake it, more of malice to reprehend mee, then
of meaning to amende me, it wil ſo diſcomfort and diſcorage me,
and take downe myne edge in ſuch ſort, that I doubt, I ſhal very
hardly be brought heereafter to repoſe confidence againe in thy
courteſie. Yet if thou bee learned, and wilt tel me of my faults louingly,
ſpare not, I wil take it moſt thākfully: alſo if thou be one of
Momus mates, and doſt raile at my doings ſpytefullie Icare not,
I will brooke it moſt patiently, accounting it no leſſe commendation
to bee ill ſpoken of, by one that is ignoraunt and fooliſh, then
to be well ſpoken of, by one that is ſkilfull and wiſe.
            
               
Thus we ſhould doe, and thus (would to God) we could doe: but
as it is moſt eaſie to profeſſe patience in words when our eſtate is
in quiet: ſo is it very difficulte to expreſſe it in deedes, when our
affections are diſtempered. Such as take mens purſes from them
vndeſired, paſſe often by the ſentence of a cord, and ſhall ſuch as
robbe men of their good names vndeſerued, be ſuffered to eſcape
ſcotfree? This may be ſet downe for a rule that neuer fayles: that
as many men would be glad to be better thought of, then his dealings
ſhall deſerue: ſo any man would be loth to be worſe thought
of, then his doinges ſhall demerit. For to be defrauded of deſerued
prayſe, and purſued with vndeſerued reproch, may well bee
accounted a double iniurie. To conclude (gentle Reader) I haue
bin ſo charie in the choyce of the things contained in this pamphlet,
that thou mayſt finde many thinges heerein to delight
thee, and not any thing to diſpight thee. If thou ſhalt
take pleaſure, or gaine profit by the reading of
them: be thankfull to the authors, and
vouchſafe to thinke well of the
tranſlator, who when he
would thee worſt,
wiſheth thee
well.
            
               Thine in all curteſie,
Humfrey Gifford.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            ¶An Epiſtle written in Italian, by
Maiſter Claudius Ptholomoeus, for the comforting
of his very louing and learned friend, Maiſter Dionyſius,
beeing fallen into pouerty, and engliſhed by
H. G.
            
               YEe ſhould haue done me a great
pleaſure, if (as I requeſted you)
yée had come and remained with
mée at my houſe this Sommer;
where, farre from the rumors of
the city, amiddeſt the delectable
woods, yée ſhoulde haue auoyded
a great part of theſe gréefes, with
which yee now are moleſted; and
aboue al, yée ſhould not ſo ſharply
haue felt the bitinges of pouerty, which in your laſt letter,
yée ſo cruelly complayne of. For it is a thing moſt manifeſt
(as S. Hierome ſayth very well) that our eyes are the chiefe
cauſe, that pouerty ſeemeth ſo ſharpe and bitter vnto vs.
Take away the ſight of riches, by and by pouerty ſéemeth
light vnto me. When I ſée not the pompes, the treaſures, the
iewels, the riche attire, delicious tables, ſumptuous pallaces,
great traynes of ſeruants in others; I neyther ſearch for
them, nor couet after them, neyther am I carefull for being
without them. But aſſoone as theſe wilde beaſtes are once
preſented before my eyes, ſtraightwayes with theyr falſe
and deceaueable beauty, like enchauntreſſes, they lyme my
deſire, which done (like infernall furies) they torment it
with a thouſand anoyes; by the meanes whereof, all quiet &amp;
tranquillity is baniſhed frō the mind of man; in place wherof,
vnpleaſant cogitations, broken ſléepes, froward hatred,
blinde enuy, ſeruile feare, doubtfull hope, and diuers other
their cruell companions, and copeſmates, raigne, and gouerne
our affections. Truely, I my ſelfe, who do now thinke

by long experience, and ſound iudgement of mind, to be ſomwhat
ſtabliſhed, and confirmed in temperate deſires; when
ſometimes I am conuerſant (I ſay) amongſt the pompes of
the citie, I ſéeme to féele certayne waters of vayne appetites
to bubble vp wtin me, which might peraduenture breed ſome
gréeuous infirmity in my mynde, if I did not ſodainly kill &amp;
kéepe them downe with the tempeſt of moderation: &amp; doubtleſſe
as oft as I make repayre into theſe places, I ſéeme to be
carried on a calme Sea, with a moderate winde, without
ſwelling of the waues, or danger of any tempeſt. Yée might
(I ſay) haue done me a moſt acceptable pleaſure, if yee had
come vnto me, to haue auoyded the dangers &amp; annoyances of
pouerty amongſt theſe ſolitary woods, &amp; yée ſhould alſo haue
deliuered me of a great trouble in writing vnto you. For that
here ye gréen graſſe, the flooriſhing trées, the cryſtal ſtreames
the chirping birdes, the harmeleſſe beaſts, the open ayre, the
ſéeing of euery thing to reioyce at the giftes of nature, would
haue byn better maiſters for the inſtructing of you, then all
the ſchooles of Philoſophers in Athens. Or if this had not byn
ſufficient, yet had it béen more eaſy for me to haue tolde you
what was conuenient in walking, and (as it were) ſporting
with you, (then béeing diſtant) I can nowe doe by writing.
But a friend is neuer to be abandoned, rather wée ſhoulde
endeuour to ſearch out euery remedy, for his health; to vndertake
any trauell; and to put our ſelues betwixt euery danger,
for his ſafety. Although I beléeue, yée demaund conſolation
of me, not for that yée want it in your ſelfe, I knowing
you to be both wiſe &amp; temperate; but for that (as it comes too
paſſe) yée eſtéeme the conſolation geuen by a déere friend, to
be more pleaſant than your owne. For in this yée taſte but
your ſelfe onely: in the other yee ſhall participate both of the
fruite of your ſelfe, and of your friend. I ſay vnto you (Maiſter
Dionyſius) that firſt, I know not, whether to be poore or
rich, be a thing y• hath his foundation in nature, or is altogether
placed in the opinion of men. But this I cléerely know,
ye pouerty is an euil or affection, which men without neceſſity,
haue by opinion onely placed amongeſt the euils, &amp; affections,

which nature hath beſtowed on vs; &amp; haue made y• ſame
of her, as (Menander ſaith) they haue done of ambitiō, of the
iniury of words; of vnlucky dreames; of wonders, &amp; many other
things, which not being giuē vs by nature for any euill
at al; we, neuertheles through our fooliſh imagination, accoūt
thē as a diſgrace y• not a litle tormenteth vs. Through which
it comes to paſſe, that man is more vnfortunate, then any other
liuing creature whatſoeuer. Who is he liuing according
to the vſe of men nowadayes, ſeing himſelf to fal out of fauor
 wt his maiſter, had not rather haue ten burning feuers, then
loſe this his fauor? wheras if he had ſoūd iudgemēt, &amp; would
not ſuffer himſelfe to be corrupted, wt falſe imagination, he
ought rather to chooſe the diſfauour of foure maiſters, then to
ſuffer one onely feuer; for that the firſt, is an euil ſpringing
onely of opiniō, &amp; this is grounded &amp; founded in nature it ſelf.
So likewiſe ſemeth it vnto me of pouerty, yt if it be an euill
(wc I beleue not) it taketh his original onely of ye fantaſies, &amp;
thoughts of men of weak vnderſtāding, hauing no foundatiō
at all in nature. And therfore Ieſus Chriſt our ſauiour moſt
prudētly &amp; diuinely cōforted, not only his diſciples, but al the
poore alſo, wt this goodly &amp; moſt beautiful exāple of two ſparowes.
Is not man (ſaith Chriſt) of greater price then twoo
ſparowes? hath not God greater regard of him, then of theſe
litle byrds? &amp; yet they want nothing that is néedful for theyr
ſuſtenance. Shal any thing be wanting thē vnto men wt are
had in greater eſtimatiō, both wt God &amp; nature? And verily, it
is not to be doubted but that pouerty &amp; riches ſprang firſt of
the diuiſiō of dominions; being brought in rather by the gréedines
&amp; ambition of men, then by any order of nature. O bleſſed
be yée litle beaſts; you féele not at al, thoſe pearcings, &amp; priuy
bytings of pouerty, but liue freely and ioyfully in the pure
law of nature, without encombring your ſelues, with eyther
riches or pouerty. Let pouerty bée what ſhée will, I
knowe not wherefore wée ſhoulde accounte of her, when
as ſhe is not of the things that are within vs, but reckoned
in the number of thoſe that are without vs.
            
               
For man is made and framed of ſoule and body onely, and it
is not neceſſary to the compoſition of him, that there ſhoulde
appertayne a ſoule, a body, and riches. Now if pouerty be not
of the thinges within vs, but without vs, what euil (I pray
you) can ſhée doe vs? Surely it muſt be muche leſſe, then
that which offendeth the parts of which we are truely compoſed
ſickneſſe, and diſeaſes make death ſeeme vnto vs more
bitter then gall; likewiſe ignorance, dulneſſe, enuie, ſinne,
and wickedneſſe corrupt the beauty of our ſoules: of theſe in
parte we are framed. But what hath pouerty to doe with
vs? ſhée hath reſpect (as hath béene ſayde) to the thinges
without vs, and ſhoulde not anoy vs, if we (enemies to our
owne ſelues) tooke not her dartes in our handes, and with
them moſt bitterly pearced our owne ſoules. But I ſay vnto
you farther, that the reſtleſſe griefe, the lothſome irkeſomneſſe,
and cruell prickinges that pouerty procureth, ſpring
all from one roote: which is, the deſire of ſuperfluous things.
Take away the deſire of thoſe thinges that are néedeleſſe,
and all this troubleſome Sea will preſently become quiet,
and calme. Of a troth, that ſentence manifeſted by the Philoſophers,
celebrated of ye ſages, &amp; allowed by long experience
(that nature is contented with very fewe thinges) is moſt
true Whervp

               ̄ 
               Cleanthus gaue vnto men this worthy leſſō.
Wilt yu (ſaid Cleanthus) be quickly rich? be thou then poore
of deſires. I pray thée tell me how néedful is it, from defending
one from the cold, to be clothed in veluet, purple or gold,
&amp; to be alwaies in ſundry faſhions? Theſe garments bring no
helpe vnto nature, but increaſe the ſmoke of our ambition;
neither yet can we euer be ſatiſfied: wherby we gayne no other
thing, but to make our vanities, &amp; the blind cloude of our
deſires more apparāt. What neceſſity is there for the féeding
of our body &amp; ſuſtentation of our life, to haue our tables loded
with a hundred diuers meates: al placed in veſſels of ſiluer &amp;
gold? Firſt this is certaine, that if nature deſire a meaſurable
quantity of meate for her ſuſtenance; y• which is takē more, is
to the deſtroying &amp; corrupting both of nature &amp; life, wherby
it was wel &amp; truely ſpokē, that many more are ſlain by gluttony,

then by the ſword.
            And it is dayly ſéene, that many of them, at whome the
fooliſh commonaltie ſo greatly woonder, in the end are paide
home with a deſerued puniſhment for their ambitious
gluttonie: Some repleniſhing themſelues with rhewmes,
others gaining to themſelues the gout: other ſome waſting
and conſuming their liuer, &amp; cauſing their ſinewes to ſhrink:
others dying miſerably long before their time. It is manifeſt
alſo, that with their ſundry kindes of ſauces they haue
brought it ſo to paſſe, that nothing ſauoureth of it ſelfe; and
that they very ſeldome eate with appetite, or delight. O
how true is that notable ſentence, and how well proued at
all times; That hunger is the beſt ſawce of all others,
which makes all meates ſauerie and delightfull! The example
of Darius is no leſſe true then common; who in his
flight after a battaile being wearied, and drinking a quantitie
of muddy water, did ſweare, that in all his life time, hée
neuer dranke more pleaſauntly: Beholde therfore; the poore
men are moſt rich of thoſe things, of which the rich (through
their blinde vnſatiablenes) are moſt poore. Finally it is manifeſt,
that this ſuperfluous féeding is an example of crueltie:
Firſt, againſt thēſelues, that vſe it: for becauſe (as it is ſaid)
many are diſeaſed, many killed, and many brought to miſerie:)
Next, againſt a number of the poore, who (if it were
well ſéene vnto) might bée relieued temperately with that
which theſe cōſume immoderately. How much better ſhould
they doe, &amp; what more praiſe might they deſerue, both of God
&amp; the world, if (reſtraining their diet to an honeſt &amp; temperat
moderatiō) al that which is vainly ſpent, were by them conuerted
into ſome better vſe, either in marrying ſome
maides, or in giuing exhibition to yong men addicted to ſtudie,
or in vſing any other bountifull curteſie. Truely, I am
not of opinion, that for being rich they had néede to eat more:
neither that their welth doubling they ſhould redouble their
eating &amp; drinking; &amp; y• they encreaſing theſe; ſhould encreaſe
more alſo. To procéed farther in the matter, I ſay what néede
is there, for the kéeping vs from the raine, the wind, and the

ſunne, to dwel in ſumptuous pallaces, repleniſhed with moſt
coſtly ornaments, as though a little cottage might not bée
ſufficient to fence and defend vs from ſuch impreſſions, in
which alſo, for the moſt part, more reſt and ſafetie is found,
then in the other. What a fondneſſe? yea, what a monſtrous
appetite was it of Nero, when that of all the mount Celio
and more, hée made but one onely houſe, through which it
was doubted, leaſt that therein hée would haue ſwallowed
vp all Rome: and hée was not aſhamed to ſay, that now
hée began to lyue, as was conuenient for men? It pleaſeth
mée well, that ſumptuous and ſtately buildinges bée ſéene
in the world, not for any néede and tranquilitie of man, but
for the bewtifying, and ſetting out of Cities, and for the demonſtration
of the wonderfulnes and excellencie of artes.
But hée that is without them, ſo that hée haue ſome cotage
to couer himſelfe therwith, ought not to bée troubled for not
hauing of them.
            What ſhal wée ſay of the quiet bed for the wearied members?
is it requiſite that it bée adorned with golde and precious
ſtones? as the laſciuious Emperours did often vſe to
doe in times paſt at Rome? or is it ſufficient that it bée of
leaues, as was vſed in the firſt world? though but homely,
yet more naturall? True it is, that Laertes had in his houſe
none other but one olde woman, which brought him his
meate and drinke, who ſlept commonly on the ground, on a
mattreſſe made of leaues. I wil not héere enter into the diſcourſe,
what is pertinent to the vſe of mans lyfe, wher
                  •
               
ambition and vanitie is out of meaſure augmented beyond
that which the neceſſitie of Nature doeth require; and with
this encreaſing, hath brought vnto mortall creatures many
troubles, diuers diſpleaſures, &amp; infinite vexations, ſpringing
onely of a fooliſh, nay rather frantike, and raging appetite
of ſuperfluitie. Onely thus much I ſay vnto you, that vnto
a wiſe man, who will not ſuffer himſelf to bée caryed away,
with falſe reſemblances, or fained apparances, it ſufficeth
that he haue wherewith to defend himſelfe from hunger and

thirſt; and from the colde and heate: ſo that the Philoſopher
Epictetus, with a gallant ſimilitude did ſay very well.
As the foote is the meaſure of the ſhooe: ſo the meaſure of hauing
is the body of the man it ſelfe; if thou deſire to be ſtayed
héerein, a moderation muſt be obſerued in thy deſires, beyonde
the which if thou paſſe, thou muſt of neceſſitie runne
headlong into infinite inconueniences. And to bring this
to paſſe, I thinke it not neceſſary to haue the ſubſtaunce of
Craeſus, or Lucullus; but very few thinges may ſuffice for the
attaining of it, in ſuch ſorte that almoſt euery one may attain
vnto it with little difficultie, if they would but brydle and reſtrain
their deſires within the limits of an honeſt moderatiō.
            Verily, when I way and ponder theſe thinges with my
ſelfe, that diuine ſentence of Seneca, ſéemeth vnto me to bee
worthily ſpoken, who with a true leſſon warneth vs, ſaying,
If ye haue reſpect vnto that, wherewith Nature is ſuffiſed,
yee ſhall neuer be poore: if ye looke vnto that which opinion
craueth, ye ſhall neuer be rich. O moſt golden ſentence,
wherein the greateſt parte of the trauayle and repoſe
of man con
                  •
               iſteth! Who is he, that hauing reſpect only to the
neceſſities of Nature, can euer be poore? Againe, who is he y•
folowing the appetite of vain things, &amp; the deſire of ſuperfluities
that, can euer be rich? This man poſſeſſing a bewtiful
houſe
                  •
               d ſireth a village; hauing obtained that, he wold haue a
ſtock and furniture for them both: This being graunted, he
craueth great ſtore of mony for diuers vſes, &amp; neceſſities; alſo
this money being gotten, he hath a deſire to be Lord ouer caſtles,
and to haue vaſſailes vnder him: hauing brought this
alſo to paſſe, he aſpireth to be a Marqueſſe, next a Duk, then
a King, farther, an Emperour; and in the end he would bee
Lord of all the world: yet this would not ſatiſfie his greedy
appetite: for he would (with Alexander the great) be Lord
of al the worlds of Anaxagoras, in ſuch ſort, that he that poſſeſſeth
moſt, is fartheſt from his end: for that greater riches
engender greater deſires. This cruell and vnmeaſurable
luſt of hauing, is ſo great, and vnſatiable.
            
               
I would gladly learne when it may bée ſaide, that a man
hath ſufficient; when it may bée ſaide, that hée is rich. Marcus
Craſſus was wont to ſay, that no man was rich, vnleſſe
with his yearely reuenewes hée could kéepe and maintaine
an army. What fondneſſe? what vnſatiableneſſe is
this? Truly Aglaius Profidius did not poſſeſſe ſo much, but
had only one litle plot of ground, which he manured with his
owne handes: neuer the leſſe hée was iudged by the Oracle
to bée moſt happy of all men. But ſhall I now declare vnto
you how many men in extreame pouertie haue liued ioyfully
and contentedly, being had in eſtimation, and honoured
greatly? My web ſhould bée ouerlong, if I ſhould héere
recount them all, but theſe ſhall ſuffiſe. Amonſt the Grecians
Ariſtides, Phocion, Epaminondus, Pelopidus y• Thebane,
Lampſacus the Athenienſen, Socrates and Efialtus
were moſt poore, yet were they all wiſe and iuſt men, and
well eſtéemed in the world. Alſo of the Latines there
are many notable examples: but this of Curius and Fabritius
ſhall ſerue for all, of whome the one would rather commaund
him that poſſeſſed golde, then poſſeſſe it himſelfe:
The other with a bolde courage refuſed many giftes that
the Samnites did profer him. But wherof ſprange this
temperaunce in them? Without doubt no other where, but
that they had clypped the wings to the deſire of ſuperfluous
things. Of a troth this diſtinction of the Philoſophers
is moſt true; that our appetite is of two ſortes; the one meaſured,
and hauing end; the other infinite, and without end.
Al thoſe that deſire riches, onely for the loue that they beare
vnto them, haue neuer any end in their deſires: but like him
that hath the dropſie, the more they poſſeſſe, ye more alwaies
they couet: but they that temperately ſearch after riches,
not for méere loue they beare towardes them, but
to employ them to ſome neceſſary and determinate vſe,
finde ſome end, and repoſe in their deſires. For ſo much
they ought and commonly doe deſire, as is néedefull for
that ende and vſe, for which they did deſire it.
            
               
But diuers entangle themſelues, propoſing hurtfull and vnprofitable
endes, at the leaſt wiſe vnneceſſary. I therefore
haue made choyce of one chiefly, being both pure and natural:
which is ye conſeruation of our ſelues, and thoſe that are
begotten of vs: all other endes are corrupt, full of pride and
ambition, and vnnaturall. O that it pleaſed God, that men
might deſire riches to no other vſe, but for that onely, which
they indéed ſtand in néed of. Doubtles, great rumours, many
lamentations, infinite ſorowes ſhould bée quieted, which for
the want of theſe enticing riches, are dayly made amongſt
men. But know yée wherefore hée is alwayes penſiue, why
hee ſéemeth continually to bée poore, and what the cauſe is,
that hée is neuer contented with his eſtate? ſhall I tell you
the onely occaſion hereof? it procéedes of no other cauſe, but
that hée alwayes lookes before him, fixing his eie on him that
is more rich, and more mightie then himſelf, &amp; either prickt
forward by enuie, or drawne vnto it by couetouſneſſe, hée
would not only reach and ariue vnto the ſame, but alſo paſſe
farther: and they neuer looke backe, or caſt their eies on the
poore, which are (as it were) behinde them, but rather hold
them in a continuall contempt: and there are very few that
can, or know how to moderate thēſelues, from theſe vntemperate
diſorders. Of a treath there are many (yea very many)
that bitterly complaine of pouertie: who, if the whole
world were deuided into equall partes, would not haue ſo
much vnto their ſhares, as they now poſſeſſe. I verily beléeue,
that if all the men and women were placed on
the one ſide, and all the riches of the world on the other, and
that his part were equally deuided vnto euery one (as it is
ſayde Lycurgus did in Sparta) it ſhould come to paſſe, that
many that now cry out, of pouertie, ſhould apparantly
ſée, that they were ouer rich, and had more then their parts.
Amongſt which number, I thinke my ſelfe ſhould bée one,
which now account my ſelfe to bée poore, and ſo peraduenture,
would you alſo: ſo that if yée reſpect this honeſt and

meaſured end, it may bée that this your pouertie will not
make you ſeeme to bée ſo poore, as yée eſtéemed your ſelfe to
be, nor bring you ſo great affliction, finding it farre leſſe then
yée déemed it to bée. But you will ſay peraduenture (and
I denie it not) that there are a great many rich, which féele
pleaſure, contentment, and honour by them: whereas I by
my pouertie receiue ſorowe, diſpleaſure, and ſhame. What
complaintes are thoſe? Shouldeſt thou diſpayre, for not
hauing that which other men enioy? Wherefore then doe
theſe rich men (which bring you in this eſtate) diſpayre,
ſeeing others aboue them to bée Dukes, Princes, Kinges
and Emperours? Why doe not many, that delight in eating
and drinking hange themſelues, for not being able to
drinke ſo much as Trigungius did with the Romaines; or
becauſe they cannot deuoure a whole table of meate, as Catellactus
hath done in our time? and to bring a more true
and liuely example, why are not all men afflicted, and as it
were brought into diſpayre, becauſe they haue not ye ſtrength
and force of a Lion; the ſight of an Eagle; the ſwiftnes of
a Tyger; the ſenting of a Dogge; the length of the life of a
Harte, and in the end, the flyeing of byrdes.
            It is not néedefull to looke to that which others haue, but
to that which is conuenient for our eſtates and callings. And
heerein (according to euery mans degrée) to repoſe our chiefe
contentment and felicitie. But perhappes, you will ſay that
it is not requiſite to make ſuch an arithmeticall diuiſion of
the goods of Fortune, but rather that it were more conuenient
to makē a Geometrical, not according to the number,
but the deſart. It were well ſayde. But who ſhall iudge
of this deſart?
            This, doubtleſſe is the head fountaine and originall of
all errours. Euery one doeth déeme, and iudge better of
himſelfe then there is cauſe why.
            Selfeloue doeth corrupt our iudgement, and ſedure our
ſenſes in ſuch ſort, with falſe imaginations that it preſenteth
vnto vs, that in partiall eſtéeming of our ſelues, euery
one ſuffers himſelfe pleaſauntly to bée deceaued. Infinite

is the number of them, vnto whome it ſéemeth, that they
haue deſerued a great deale more then they haue: but there
are very few of the other ſorte, that thinke they haue a great
deale more then they haue deſerued: whereof grieuous perturbations,
and continuall lamentations, for the want of
riches and preferment, doe afterwards enſue. I knowe not
then how in this generall diſcourſe wée ſhould conſider of
the deſartes of euery one aright, through which, all things
might bée brought into queſtion and controuerſie.
            It is a great deale better to ponder by this Arithmetical
diuiſion, that the greateſt part of them, that complaine of
pouertie, ſhall finde themſelues deceaued, if the world were
deuided into equall partes. But let vs paſſe on farther, if
it pleaſe you; and let vs ſet downe, with what iuſt meaſure
riches and pouertie ought to bée meaſured. Euery one doeth
loue, honour, and reuerence riches, and couet after them.
Euery one holdeth pouertie in contempt, deſpiſeth her,
and flyeth from her. Know yée wherfore? For that euery
man onely reſpecteth the good, and commoditie of riches, neuer
forecaſting the euils and diſcommodities that they bring
with them. Contrarily, euery one lookes vnto the euill,
that is found to bée in pouertie, and there ſtayeth himſelfe;
but none reſpecteth or hath regarde to the good, and commeditie
that commeth by her: ſo that it is not to bée wondered at,
if (the eies being opened to the good that riches hath in them,
and ſhut to the euill) ſo many doe prayſe and deſire them.
Neither is it any meruaile likewiſe, if (opening them to
the euill that pouertie hath in her, and ſhutting them to the
good) euery one deſpiſeth, and eſcheweth it. Know yée then
wherof this procéedeth? ſurely of none other cauſe, but the
firſt apparaunce. For that riches doeth preſent her ſelfe vnto
vs, which a gladſome and chéerefull countenaunce, bringing
with her a certaine counterfeit bewtie, that doth daſell our
eies, and lime our ſenſes and affections, with her enticement:
in ſuch ſorte, that we are drawne, and as it were brought
beſids our ſelues, with theſe couloured enchātments, beléeue
that euery thing of her is pleaſaunt, bewtifull and good:

And theſe ſhaddowes, and faigned reſemblances, wherewith
ſhee is ſet out vnto vs, will not permit vs to penetrate
into the naughtineſſe, that ſhée conceales within her,
nor ſuffer vs to ſée the poyſon that lyes hidden vnder her,
through which that chaunceth oftentimes, which is ſpoken
of the Marmaides, that (alluring with their ſwéete, but deceaueable
voyces) men ſée not the great euill that lurketh
vnder them, and is prepared for them. On the other ſide,
pouertie preſenteth her ſelfe vnto vs with a filthy and
horrible countenaunce, in ſuch ſort, that none would euer
ſurmiſe, that any good thing were contained within her▪
neuertheleſſe, vnder il fauoured counterfeites, moſt bewtifull
figures, and wonderfull workes, both of arte and nature
are oftentimes comprehended. But (as I ſayd) theſe
meaſures are not iuſt, neyther can the troth euer bée boulted
out by them.
            It is not ſufficient of one thing to open onely the good,
concealing the euill; and of another, to lay forth onely the euill,
not reuealing the good: and troth cannot poſſible bée deſcerned
from a doubtful matter, if a diuiſion of the good and
the euill that reſteth in eyther of them, bée not firſt made and
ſifted out, and the ſubſtaunce of the thing after conſidered
of accordingly. It being a moſt true and vnfallible principle,
that all things vnder the Sunne, are (I know not in
what ſorte) entermixed with good and euill, ſo that nothing
is neither wholly good, nor wholly euill: and now it
may well bée ſayde, that riches bringes with her much euill;
and pouertie containeth in her not a little good. Neyther is
it conuenient that they, whoſe pouertie is great, ſhould bée
left without an aduocate, as wée often ſée they are: but good
&amp; iuſt Princes ſhould ſée their right graunted them without
any expence. Behold again y• riches puffe men vp wt a certain
vaine kind of inſolencie, and makes them become proud, and
diſdaineful, wheras pouertie repleniſheth them with humilitie,
and makes them humble and curteous: we ſée Pallantes
the frée man of Clodius to bée out of meaſure

rich: we ſée him likewiſe to be paſſing proude, in ſuch ſorte,
that in a long ſeaſon, he would not vouchſafe to ſpeake to any
of his ſeruantes: we ſée Fabritius to be moſt poore, we ſée him
therewith, very lowlie and pleaſant. But one example may
ſuffice for a thouſand, for wee may daily reade, heare, and ſee
them. This firſt Dowry therefore is to be deteſted, that riches
brings with her, in that it makes men proude and inſolent;
as that of pouerty is to be beloued, in that it makes men
humble and curteous. Riches make not men onely to be
puft vp with pride, but alſo drowneth them in diuers kinds
of voluptuous naughtineſſe, for it maketh them laſciuious,
vaine, giuen to gluttonie, alwayes occupied in earthly delightes,
and wallowing in worldly wantonneſſe, and filth of
the fleſhe: for that being poſſeſſors of great riches, they déem
it a priuiledge, and reckon it in place of great game, that by
the meanes of them they may feede their ſuperfluous appetites
and diſordinate affections. Wheras the poore acknowledging
his eſtate, for the moſt part liues ſparingly &amp; temperatelie,
not ſo greatly corrupted, nor defiled with vaine &amp;
worldly allurements. That Plutarcke ſaide verie wel, tearming
pouertie to be an abundant temperance, and a ſtrict
obſeruance of the Lawes, in ſuch ſort that Arceſilaus was
accuſtomed to ſay, that pouertie was ſharpe after the manner
of craggie Ithaca, but yet brought foorth good ſonnes,
teaching them to abſtaine and ſuffer, and making them frugal,
concluding that it was a notable ſchoolehouſe and open
wraſtling place for all vertue. What ſhal I ſay more?
Riches make men become diſpiſers of God, at the leaſtwiſe
little acknowledging his power, and bountie. For the rich
man ſeing himſelfe to abound in wealth, and encreaſe in ſubſtance,
ſemeth in his owne conceite not to ſtand in need of any
other aſſiſtance, wherefore he verie ſeldome hath recourſe
vnto God, and ſeldome prayeth vnto him, or is thankefull
for his benefites: but as it were, dependeth of himſelfe onely,
ſwelling and wondering at his owne wiſedome, and (as one
might ſay) playing the Peacock in his felicity. Wheras the

poore man cōfeſſing his imbecillity, runneth vnto God for refuge;
&amp; acknowledging his bounty, cōmits himſelfe wholy to
his cuſtodie, lauding and prayſing his name, and calling him
to his ayde and aſſiſtance. But riches doe not onely corrupt
the will; but together therewith, are a hinderance, and impediment
to the vnderſtanding: for theſe (for the moſt part) accounting
it ynough to be rich, ſeldome or neuer geue theyr
mindes, to good and laudable ſtudies; or noble and high contemplations,
eyther of philoſophy, or of any other ſcience:
but rather addict theyr whole endeuours, eyther to ſome
vayn &amp; friuolous paſtimes▪ or to the encreaſe of their riches.
Whereof it comes to paſſe, that the true and right end of ſcience
is changed into a falſe, and counterfayte. For that the
right vſe to learne ſcience in déede, is, for the more, and better
perfecting and ennobling the mind of man: But the common
ſort, wreſt it cleane contrary, accounting the acquiring of
ſubſtance, to be the onely ende of the learning of Science.
Through which the rich man weaues the webbe of his owne
woe, ſaying in himſelfe; what cauſe is there, that I ſhoulde
trauell my ſelfe in ſtudie? if I be already rich, I am come to
the end; what néede is it then that I haue recourſe, eyther to
the beginning or midſt. But the poore man, mooued eyther
with the right or wrong way, with great deſire and feruent
affection followeth his ſtudie: Through which it hath béene
ſéene, and is ſéene daily that many poore men by learning,
attayne vnto great excellency, promotion, and preferment.
So that Taletus the noble Philoſopher ſaid very well; who
ſo affirmeth (quoth he) that pouerty withdraweth a man frō
Philoſophy, &amp; riches enflame him with the deſire of it, is deceaued
greatly. O God, how many doe we ſée, hindred rather
by abundance of ſubſtance, then by ſcarcity? is it not euident
that the poore (for the moſt part) geue themſelues to ſtudie?
that the riche buſied in other affaires, either cannot, or will
not follow their learning? So much of Taletus. But let vs
procéede farther. Who ſéeth not that the rich men with great
difficultie come to the knowledge of the troth? hauing alwayes

about them a company of fayned friendes: &amp; ſwarme
of flatterers? Many examples might here be alleadged of rich
men that haue bin abuſed by ſuch diſſemblers; wheras y• poore
man is frée from this plague? none going about to circumuēt
him by flattery, it being a thing moſt manifeſt, that they that
profeſſe to be his friends are true friends, it being farre from
any ſuſpition, that they ſhould come to flatter him, or fayn to
be his friends, to the end, to pluck his wealth &amp; ſubſtāce from
him, who ſtandeth more in néed to be reléeued himſelf, then to
giue to others. What ſhal I here ſpeak of the ſnares that are
intended agaynſt the rich: both towards their ſubſtance and
perſons? It were better for the beaſt called the Caſtor, that
he had not thoſe vertuous ſtones, when as for them he is ſo
purſued of the hunters; it ſhould be better alſo for men y• they
had not theſe riches, whē as ſo many ſnares &amp; deceits are laid
by other men for the getting of them. But euen as the Caſtor
(as ſome write of him) ſéeing the hunters purſue him, bytes
of his ſtones, for the ſauegard of the reſt of his body: ſo ſhould
that rich man doe, which ſéeth himſelf beſieged wt ſnares, and
counter watches for his ſubſtance, &amp; rather to chooſe to caſt al
away, then not to be aſſured of his life, &amp; liberty. That déede
therfore of Crates the Philoſopher was woorth the noting:
who ſéeing himſelf encombred, and his eſtate indangered,
through a great quantity of iewels, &amp; monie y• he had, threw
all into the Sea: ſaying, I had rather drowne you, then yée
ſhoulde cauſe me to periſh or be deſtroyed. Great are the nū
               ber
of the rich men wt are iniuried and purſued of the mighty,
to the end to procure their ſubſtance from them. Wherefore
was he that was baniſhed at the inſtant requeſt of Fuluia ſo
hardly dealt with, but that Fuluia woulde haue had his faire
houſe from him? The bookes of hiſtories both old and new
are repleniſhed with examples of them, wt makes me in opinion
to be contrary to Anacarſus. He ſaid, y• the lawes were
like the ſpiders web, into wt if any light or ſmal thing fell, it
there remained, but being great, it paſſeth through, and brake
it aſunder. Contrariwiſe, I ſay that they are like vnto ye nets

of hunters, into the which if any little beaſt happen, he preſently
paſſeth through the meſhes, the nets not béeyng made
to that end: but if any good beaſt enter therein, as a hare, a
goate, or a Déere, he ſticketh faſt, and is taken, being both
good and profitable for the hunters. Verily the couetous rich
man liueth continually in great ſuſpition &amp; feare, leaſt that
his ſubſtance be taken from him; or that he be beguiled of it,
or forced to depart with it againſt his will; ſo that euery ſhadow
ſéemeth a Bugbeare vnto him; euery little ſtirring in
the houſe diſquieteth him: ſo that both at home in his chamber,
and abroade in his iourney, he is neuer without ſuſpition,
not vnlike the man that is ielous of ſome woman whom
he loueth. Whereas the poore man, not hauing his breſt loaded
with ſuch feare; and féeling himſelfe to bee light in his
iourney, ſtandes not in doubt to be robbed: As that common
verſe ſayeth,
            
               The man, that trauelling by the way
               no wealth with him doth beare,
               Amids the troopes of theeues may ſing,
               not hauing cauſe of feare.
            
            AND doubtleſſe if it be well conſidered of, the poore man
hath but one care, which is, to procure a little ſuſtenance
wherewith to liue, but the rich man hath thrée thoughts and
cares together. The one to conſerue the riches that he hath:
the other how to encreaſe them: the third how to diſpoſe thē:
through which it comes to paſſe, that the poore man is repleniſhed
with greater hope then feare; and of the other part, the
rich man is aſſailed more with feare, then hope. He alwaies
hopeth to change his poore eſtate and miſerable fortune into
the better, béeyng already placed in the loweſt degrée that
Defilus ſayde w
                  •
               ll.
            
               
               The man that is moſt poore,
               moſt happy is of all;
               For that he neuer feares
               in worſe eſtate to fall.
            
            This alwayes doubteth leaſt that his ſwéete will bee tranſformed
into ſower, through which it is euident, that the
poore féeleth a greater tranquillity in his minde, being repleniſhed
with hope, then doth the riche being ſurpriſed with
feare. What farther? That pouerty bringeth foorth more
woorthy effects then riches, not onely in it ſelfe, but in others
alſo. For pouerty rayſeth pitie &amp; compaſſion in others which
are moſt beautifull vertues in mans minde, but riches inflame
and ſtirre them vp to enuie, which is a moſt wicked
vice. Wherefore if good effectes come of good cauſes, and
nanghtie of naughtie cauſes, it is verie likely that pouertie
is more vertuous that ingendereth vertue, then are riches,
that produce vices in others. What more ſhal I ſay, that
riches procure delightes, delightes tendernes and delicaſie
of the bodie, tenderneſſe and delicaſie cauſeth weakenes
and faintneſſe, through which it happeneth that rich men
are leſſe able to tollerate trauel, heate and colde, and other
humaine diſcommodities, then the poore are, who by a patience
perforce, are taught to endure all labour and trauell,
and euery little impreſſion of the ayre, neyther are brought
down wt euery litle trifling diſeaſe, as the rich are. What farther?
Riches ingender faintneſſe of courage, in the poſſeſſors
of them, in that for feare of abandoning of them; they wil not
aduenture to hazard them ſelues in any daunger, neither for
their friendes, nor for their kinred, nor countrie, neither yet
for themſelues, but are alwayes of a timerous and fearefull
minde. But the poore man not drawne backe with the ieloſie
of this worldly pelfe, ſheweth his valure boldely, and
couragiouſly expoſeth himſelfe to perils and daungers for
the loue of his freendes, &amp; countrie. What beſides this? Abundant
riches make men ſluggiſh, not ſuffering them to awake

to any good exerciſe; wheras pouerty ſeldom permits
them to ſtand drowſie and idle, but awakens them to beautiful
inuentions, and laudable trauels. But let vs conſider one
point that toucheth rich men to the quicke, but the poore nothing
ſo muche. All men both by the law of God and nature,
of neceſſity muſt once die. But he that aboundes in riches,
with what griefe and torment doeth he depart this life? hee
would not leaue his fayre houſe, his gallant village, his coſtly
apparrel; his braue horſes, his bright ſiluer: his glittering
gold, and other infinite commodities, and delights that he taſteth
in this world: which ſéeing that he muſt néedes forgoe,
he is out of meaſure vexed, and through inward griefe killes
himſelfe, before the houre of his death approch. But the poore
man, who takes litle ioy in this world, makes no great reckoning
to leaue it, not taſting that bitter ſorow, with dying,
which the rich men féele: hoping to inioy a better life in the
world to come. The poore alſo in this world haue great conſolation:
and it is no ſmal comfort vnto them, to think that the
rich (wil they, nil they) muſt die, and that they are forced (in
ſpite of their téeth) to forgoe al theyr ſubſtance. Neither will
we omit to ſay, that ſomtimes honeſt pouerty bringeth with
it more liberty &amp; contentment of life, then vnmeaſurable riches:
for that is franke and frée, &amp; this is tyed and bounde, to
reſpects, and ſuſpitions. So that now we perceaue, that al is
not pleaſant, &amp; delightful that is found in riches, nor al vnſauery,
and bitter that is tried in pouerty, but in this, much
of the ſwéete; and in the other not a litle of the ſowre: in both
ſéene, felt, and taſted. Now let vs procéed a litle farther. And
(if yée thinke it good) let it be graunted, that pouerty is euill
and contemptuous, and hath in it no conſolatiō (but truely it
hath in it all theſe comforts, of which we haue before made
mention, which béeing well taſted of the poore man, hée ſhall
féele no litle contentment in his pouerty) let this be conſidered
farther, that he is not onely poore: &amp; that this euill is not
taken from all others, and caſt on him alone: but the

number of the poore are vnnumerable, when as of the riche
there are very few: Through which, if to haue company in
ones aduerſity, make the euill to ſéems the leſſe, howe light
ſhould the euil of pouerty be, the poore man hauing ſo great
a number of other poore men to aſſociate him? Let vs conſider
farther that pouertie doth not alwayes pinche, but onelie
then, when he féeleth the want of ſome thing that he greatly
néedeth. It is not like a quotidian Agewe, which whiles it
endureth, alwayes vexeth and tormenteth a man; but this
yéeldes the reſt and repoſe, firſt whileſt thou ſléepeſt, thou
haſt no féeling of her: whereof this auncient Prouerbe tooke
his original; That in one halfe of theyr life, there was no difference
betwixt the happy, and vnfortunate.
            Further, many houres of the day, a man thinkes not of
it: but liues ioyfully, as if he were rich, and in good caſe. I
haue ſéene many poore men, leade their liues ſo iocundly, as
did neuer king nor Emperour. On the other ſide, I haue
knowne many rich men, haue theyr myndes alwayes troubled
and diſquieted, as if they were wrapped in extréeme
want, and miſery: neuer to laugh, neuer to be gladſome, nor
ioyful, wherby I haue noted, that the true tranquillity of the
mynde ſprings not of thinges that are without vs, but of
that delectable muſicke, and well tempered harmonie,
of the humayne affections that are within vs. Let vs
farther conſider howe that pouertie is a thing that may
bée taken from vs in a day, in an howre, and as it
were, in a moment. It is not as too bee blynde, lame,
fooliſhe, or maymed, or a calamitie whereof no hope remayneth
euer to bee cured; but pouerty may ſodaynlie
bee taken away: eyther by the beneuolence of thy prince,
or ſome noble man, or by the meanes of ſome wealthie
friende, who mooued by ſome fauourable motion, will
aduaunce thee too riches.
            
               
               Abdolomenus was moſt poore, Alexander the great had a
deſire to make him king, and it was done preſently. Héere-vpon
Menander ſayde well, that of all euils, pouerty was the
lighteſt, for that any friend that wil aſſiſt thée, may vnlode
thee of it. On the other ſide, riches are frayle, &amp; fugitiue, when
as a man in a moment may be bereft of all. (O God) howe
many haue wée our ſelues ſéene, either by ſpoyling on the
land, or by drowning theyr ſhippes on the Sea, or by confiſcation
of their goods, or through the diſpleaſure of the Prince,
of moſt rich, on the ſodayne to become moſt poore. Let vs farther
conſider that the poore man is néerer the attayning of
his ende, then is the rich: Foraſmuch as hée doth not ordinarily
deſire more then wherewith to ſupply his neceſſities,
which (as hath béen ſhewed before) are few, and may eaſily
be remedied. But the rich man, ſwelling through the pride
of his ſubſtance, hath his naturall, and reaſonable appetite
corrupted, and deſires to encreaſe infinitely in his riches,
whereby it may bée ſéene, that hée is farther from his ende,
then the poore man. What more? That the rich man encreaſing
in wealth, encreaſeth alſo in deſires, and by howe
much his riches are the greater, ſo much the greater alſo are
his needes. Whereof this ſentence was wiſely ſpoken.
Neceſſe eſt eum multis indigere, qui multa habeat: He that hath
many things, muſt of neceſſitie want many thinges. Let
it be conſidered farther that man is borne naked, and hath
that which he poſſeſſeth of the méere grace of God, in ſuch
ſort, that if he will rightly eſtéeme euery thing: he ought not
to be penſiue and ſorowfull for that hée hath not, but
ought rather to render immortall thankes vnto GOD, for
that which hée hath. Finally, let this bée wayde, that if
pouerty bée euill, it is very ſhorte, let it endure as long as
it can; for all the time wée haue to liue héere, béeing compared
with the infinite eternity that endureth euerlaſtingly,
is but as it were the twinckling of an eye.
            But I greatly maruell, that man, knowyng how hée

muſt die, and ſomtimes thinking thereof, doth not take
comfort of his pouertie, and (as it were) of euery other euill
that hée ſuffereth: For that, either hée beléeues that our ſoule
is immortall (as wée ought true and reſolutely to beléeue) or
thinkes (as ſome naughtie and peruerſe people doe) that ſhee
ſhall die together with the body. If hée déeme it to bee immortall,
and ſées infinite rewardes in an other world, ſette
downe for the good, and euerlaſting tormentes for the wicked,
who is hée (as one might ſay) that would not little ſet by
all the euill and good of this world, to gaine the felicitie of
the other. But if hée now thinke the ſoule to bee mortall,
how can pouertie afflict him, if hée conſider of the entire deſtruction
of himſelfe? But if hée reſolue of neither of theſe,
it is an euil of al others moſt to bée deteſted. Hyppocrates in
his diuine Oracles, ſayeth, that when two euils afflict one
place, of which the one is great, and the other very little,
the leſſer is not felt. If then pouertie, in compariſon of the
entire deſtruction of himſelfe bée a light euill: how ſhould
it ſo pinch and torment them? But as it is moſt requiſite,
let vs bée Chriſtians, and affirme not onely the immortalitie
of the ſoule, but vnfaignedly beléeue the infallible lawe
of Ieſus Chriſt, reuealed vnto vs by the light of his grace,
taught vs by the diuine ſcriptures, confirmed by the teſtimonie
of ſo many Martyrs, ſhewed by ſo many lightes of diuine
vnderſtandinges, approued by the vniuerſall lawe of
God, by which wee are guided through this ſea of fayth. Let
vs I ſay, bée Chriſtians, and then wée ought not to account
pouertie to bée euill, but deeme it rather to bée a true imitation
of Chriſt, who whiles hée remained in this world, liued
alwayes poorely, and méekely. But beſides this imitation,
the commaundements that the eternall veritie hath
left vs, to doe in many places, teache it vs, which
if I ſhoulde héere ſette it downe at large, I greatly
feare, that in ſtéede of a comforting friend, yée would thinke
mée to bée a tedious preacher. I will only rehearſe vnto you
his wonderfull and diuine philoſophy, when as hée ſayeth; I
ſay vnto you, Be yée not careful what to eate, nor wherwith

to cloath your ſelues. Is not the ſoule of more valew then
meate? and the body, then rayment? Beholde the little
fowles of the ayre, who ſow not, neither reape, nor gather into
their barnes, and yet our heauenly father feedeth them al.
Are not you of more account then they? which of you is there,
that with al your thought can ad one cubyt to your ſtature?
Why are you ſo carefull for apparell? conſider the Lyllies
of the fielde in what ſorte they grow, they worke not, they
ſpinne not, and yet I ſay vnto you, that Solomon in all his
royaltie was not cloathed like vnto one of theſe. And if God
cloath the graſſe of the field, which too day is ſéene, and too
morrow is throwne into the furnace, how much rather will
hée cloath you, O yée of little fayth? wherfore bée not troubled
in your ſelues, ſaying, What ſhal wée 
                  •
               at, or, what ſhal
we drinke, and wherwith ſhall wée bée cloathed? Theſe
thoughtes are of the heathen, and not of Chriſtians. Your
heauenly father knoweth well, what yée néede. Séeke
firſt the kingdome of God, and his righteouſnes, and all other
things that yée ſtand in néede of ſhal bée giuen vnto you.
Bée yée not carefull what to eate tomorow: but let too morow
care for it ſelfe. Sufficient is vnto the day, the trauayle
thereof. O moſt diuine Philoſophy, which, if it were well
taſted of men, and not lightly paſſed ouer, no man would euer
bée grieued or afflicted with pouertie. But wée, (for the
moſt part) haue not any feruent deſire to enter to the quick,
in the ſearching out the troth of thinges, through which it
comes to paſſe, that wée ſeldome, or neuer vnderſtand aright.
It is not néedefull to lay vp treaſure héere on earth, where
ruſt and moathes doe conſume; but in heauen, where neither
ruſt nor moathes do conſume, nor théeues breake in &amp; ſteale.
And if wée conſider farther, how hard it is for a rich man to
enter into the kingdome of heauen, there is none of ſo little
vnderſtanding, but wil deſpiſe and abhor riches: not, but that
rich men may be ſaued: but for that ye moſt part of them haue
their mindes ſo encumbred with riches, y• it is very hard for

them to attaine ſaluation: &amp; therefore Chriſt ſaid, it is leſſe
eaſie for a rich man to enter into the kingdome of heauen, thē
for a Camel to paſſe thorow the eie of a needle. For hée whoſe
affection is greedily ſet on riches, ſeldome thinkes reuerently
of God, but ſo fixeth his deſire on earthly things, yt he makes
himſelfe vnworthy of the glory of heauen, preferring mundane
vanitie, before Gods veritie. Wheras Chriſt teaching
chriſtian perfection, ſaieth otherwiſe, to the Hebrew young
man: Goe, and ſell that which thou haſt, and giue it to the
poore, &amp; after follow mée. Truely pouertie is a dowrie moſt
conuenient for a Chriſtian: Therfore, when yee know your
ſelues to bee poore, bée yée not comfortleſſe: but rather thinke
that yée are the more in Gods fauour, who in al his ſayings,
and doings, recommended the poore, prayſed them, called
them bleſſed, and receiued them into his protection, being
déere and beloued of him: ſo that it is a moſt goodly thing to
liue poorely, in this ſhort and tranſitorie life; to become moſt
rich in the life to come, which ſhalbe permanēt &amp; euerlaſting:
to ſet at naught the falſe and deceaueable Iewels of this
world; to gaine moſt plentifull and abundant treaſure in paradiſe.
O moſt worthy marchandiſe! O moſt plentiful gaine!
which neither théeues can rob thée of; nor ſeruaunt beguile
thée; nor debter deceaue thée: but will fill and repleniſh thée
with farre greater, and better fruite, then by the tongue of
man may bée expreſſed. What ſhal I ſay farther? that thoſe
thinges are few, and very eaſie to bée procured, with which
our humane nature is ſuffiſed: but many and infinite, which
our appetite deſireth.
            And that the grace of God is neuer wanting vnto thoſe,
who filled with a feruent ſpirite, refraine their earthly affections,
and reſtraine them within the limites of Chriſtian
temperaunce. Wherof Saint Paule writing vnto Timothy
moſt diuinly ſaid, It is a great gain of godlines, to be cō
               tented
with y• which is ſufficient. We brought nothing into
this world, &amp; it is manifeſt, that we ſhal carie nothing hence

with vs. But hauing conuenient foode and apparell, let vs
content our ſelues therwith: for they that would become
rich, fall into the ſnares, and temptations of the deuil, and into
ſundry hurtfull and vnprofitable deſires, which drowne
thē in ruine &amp; perditiō: for that couetouſnes is y• roote of al euill:
which diuers falling into, ſtray from the true fayth, and
are encombred with many eares and ſorowes. O wordes
worthy to pearce into the liuely heartes of men, and ſo there
to bée grounded and grauen, that with no earthly force, they
might euer bée raſed out.
            The diuine wordes of Paule being throughly conſidered
of, there is no cauſe wherefore poore men ſhould bée penſiue
or ſorowfull. But wherefore wade I farther in the comforting
of them; when as it is impoſſible for mée to ſay ſo much,
but that much more will remaine vnſpoken? And I am aſſured,
I haue ſcarſly launched out from the ſhore, and am far
from being halfe entred from this moſt profound, and large
ſea. And yet, herewith I know aſſuredly, that the leaſt
part of that, which hath béene ſayd, is ſufficient for the quieting
and cōforting of any mind, that is not become eyther
beaſtly, or furious with the prickings, or pinchings that pouertie
may bring vnto him: ſo that, if thoſe thinges, which
I haue ſayde, and many other that I could alledge, doe not
moderate and pacifie him, beléeue mée, pouertie is not the
cauſe héereof: but this diſtemperate, and ill compoſed mind,
which alſo would haue moleſted him, if hée had béene rich.
For hée would haue found out ſome other arrow, or ſworde
wherewith to haue thorowe pearced his heart. You then,
who haue your minde ſtored with ſo many good leſſons of
Philoſophy, comfort your ſelfe, and take all thinges that
God ſendes, in good part; hope in him, who neuer fayleth
nor deceaueth them, that put their truſt in him. Hée will
open you the way, and miniſter the meane, whereby to cure
theſe woundes of pouerrie; at the leaſt hée will teach you,
how to beare them with patience: and peraduenture alſo

will giue you manifeſtly to vnderſtand that it is for your
health and conſolation. Comfort your ſelfe, in that although
yée want riches, yet want yée not y• true knowledge, &amp; bewtie
of wit &amp; vnderſtanding, and vertues of the mind, which
things are more appertinent and proper vnto you, then are
riches; which are placed among the externall things, and
are no part of you; and ſo much the more comfort your ſelf,
by how much the giftes of your mind cannot bée taken from
you, neither by men, nor fortune; but of your riches and
worldly ſubſtaunce, théeues may ſpoyle you in a moment.
Comfort your ſelfe, in y• yée haue many good friendes, which
loue you entyrely, who will neuer endure to ſée you long in
poore eſtate. But rather after the maner of true and ſtedfaſt
friendes, will account your pouertie to bée their owne, and
with ſome part of their ſubſtance, will take it from you:
comfort your ſelf, with your bookes, which yée were alwaies
accuſtomed to hold in great eſtimation; they will féede and
nouriſh your vnderſtanding, and with ſingular declectation,
alwayes recreate your ſenſes: they will pacifie euery ſtormie
and troubleſome tempeſt; and both by night and by day;
within doores, and witho
                  •
               t; in good fortune and bad, will remaine
your moſt faythfull friendes, and comfortable companions.
            Finally, comfort your ſelfe, in that, if pouertie bée euill,
yet haue yée not this euill by your owne offence, or procuremen,
not by dicing and carding, nor by haunting the tauern;
not by playing the harlot, nor by any other ſort of lewde lyfe,
or naughtie behauiour: but in euery action your vſage hath
béene honeſt, and temperate; your minde being no leſſe adorned
with lawdable cuſtomes, and conditions, then learning.
Yée are then fallen into this neceſſitie, by the offence
of Fortune, who (as it is not vnknowne to the moſt part of
Rome) being enuious at the good courſe that yée haue taken,
hath many yeares ſithence wounded your body, and brought
you into a miſerable &amp; daungerous eſtat, oftentimes euen to

death; hath alſo ſetled &amp; letted you back, from all good enterpriſes
&amp; operatiōs both of body &amp; mind; &amp; in this her rage hath
cauſed you to make far greater expence, then your abilitie
will reach vnto; in ſuch ſort, that yée are now brought into
that miſerable eſtate, in which yée now are, onely by her ſiniſter
procurement: ſo that if with her great outrage, there
were not ioyned an arrogant impudencie, ſhée would not for
very ſhame of her ſelfe bée ſéene any more in the world. But
beſides theſe conſolations, let reaſon &amp; neceſſitie moue you; ye
afflict your ſelfe; what doth this affliction auaile you? is your
pouertie taken away by making of ſo great ſorowe as yée do?
if it were ſo, it were a very good remedie. But, alas, ſhée
is not yet departed, but remaines as at the firſt, or rather
greater; and this vnceſſant ſorowing doth not onely profit,
but rather endomage you greatly. Adding to the firſt euil,
the moſt grieuous euill of affliction; whereof Plato in his
bookes of a Common wealth, ſaid moſt diuinely, That it
was the beſt thing that could bée in calamitie, to take it ſo
paciently &amp; to be contented therwith as wée poſſibly can: in ye
firſt it is vncertain, whether the thing, for which we lament,
be good or euill. Farther, the being ſorowfull, doth not in any
thing remedie that which is happened: beſides that, no
humaine thing ſhould bée of ſuch eſtimation, that it ſhould
moue a man to dwell in anguiſh for it.
            What more? that griefe and ſorow are a hinderaunce to
thoſe remedies which might ſpéedily haue béene taken. Moſt
true and worthy are thoſe reaſons of Plato, which if they
were well wayed, and duely conſidered of, who is there that
euer would afflict himſelfe for any worldly calamite? Truely
ſuch ſorowing is forbidden to all: but to the learned and
vertuous, much more: whereof Fauorinus ſaide moſt wiſely,
that a man of bold courage, trained vp in the golden precepts
of true Philoſophy, ſhould haue tranquillitie of minde, ſhut
vp and ſetled in his breſt, before any ill hap light vpon him:
which is no more to ſay, but y• a wiſe man ſhold haue a ſtrong
Armour in a readines, wherewith to defend himſelfe againſt

euery ſtroke and aſſault of fortune. But what meane I to
go forwardes to ſpeake vainely as a Philoſopher, hauing already
reaſoned with you as a Chriſtian? The largnes of the
matter doth cary mée away; and the great affection that I
beare you, doeth prick mée forward, neither can I well ſet
downe, which of theſe two are greater. Therfore, vnleſſe I
would alwayes ſpeake, it is néedeful that I make an ende of
ſpeaking. It was an eaſie thing, to enter into the déepe ſea
of this argument, but vneaſie to get forth. Wherfore I muſt
doe héere, as Alexander the great did by Gordianus his knot,
who being vnable to vndoe it, did cut it in ſunder with his
ſword. Now although pouertie haue not all that dowries of
mée, which God and Nature hath endewed her with: yet
haue I beſtowed ſo many on her, that ſhe may euery way go
richely to her huſband. Yee ought not to feare of being any
more poore, ſhée bringing ſo wealthy a dowrie to your houſe:
neither néede yée to ſtand in doubt of hauing many riualles,
to contend for her, as Eurimacus, &amp; Antinous, with other woers
did for Penelope, for that pouertie (as Xenophon in the
perſon of Socrates ſaies very well) amongſt other her vertues,
hath this priuiledge: that ſhée prouoketh not men, to
brawle and fight, and to deceaue and ſéeke one an others
death for the hauing of her, as it often commeth to paſſe, for
the attaining of riches, honour or kingdomes: for although
ſhée be not lockt vp, nor garded, ſhée conſerues and kéepes
her ſelfe, and that which is moſt to be eſtéemed, ſhée is ſo modeſt
and chaſt, that none in the houſe where ſhée dwelleth,
will bée ielous of her. Sée then whether ſhée bée honeſt, or
deſerue to bée had in reputation, or no.
            But know yée not why ſhée remaies without a huſband?
It is not for want of any goodneſſe, or bewtie, being endued
plentifully with eyther of them: But becauſe euery one doth
ſtaine and defile her; euery one holdes her in contempt, filling
her with filthineſſe, and moſt ſpitefull pollutinges, in
ſuch ſorte, that her true and natiue bewtie cannot bée ſéene.

But if any man would louingly bring her to his houſe, and
purifie and waſh her, adorning her with her true and proper
ornamentes, no doubt ſhée would appeare moſt gallant
and bewtifull: and it will then euidently bée ſéene, how
vile and contemptible riches are in compariſon of her. Behold
almoſt, I cannot ende, and yet I will end. Fare yée
well: and repoſe your confidence in God, who is the true
and bountifull diſpenſer of all good thinges.
         
         
            An anſwere of Maiſter Clodius Ptholomoeus,
to a Letter ſente him by a friende, that meruelled
wherefore hee hauing ſuch learning, remayned
in ſo meane and baſe an eſtate
of calling.
            
               IN the laſt Letter that I receiued from
you, great was the woonder and complaint
that yée brought in againſt mée,
which conſidering that it ſpringeth altogether
of the ouer great affection that yée
beare towards mée, I neither maruell at
it, nor am ſory for it.
            This auoucheth that to bée true, which is ſpoken by Plato,
That the louer is often blinded in the thing beloued: I
account my ſelfe déepely indebted to your curteſie, for this
your affection: but therwithall I wiſh your iudgement to
bée ſomwhat more temperate: for I would not that contrary
effects ſhould méete in mée at one inſtant, féeling pleaſure
of the loue y• yée beare mée, &amp; diſpleaſure of your iudgement.
I pray you therefore better to conſider of this poynte following,
and after pronounce ſuch iudgement of mee, as
yée ſhall thinke requiſite.
            
               
That as an auncient cauiller did appeale from Caeſar béeyng
moued and angry, to Caeſar being not moued nor angry; ſo I
at this preſent appeale from you beyng carried away with
ouer great affection, to your ſelf hauing Reaſon for your gouerneſſe.
Yée doe not a litle maruel that I, in ſo long a time
haue not lept to any degrée of honour or fortune. It ſéeming
vnto you that my linage, my countrey, my age, my ſtudies,
my cuſtomes, my long aboade in the court, my fauour acquired
with men of high calling, and finally, my preſent noble
and honorable ſeruice, ſhould haue aduanced me; yea and farther
that many other are dayly to bée ſéene in the court, endued
with qualities farre inferiour to mine, to leape ſodainly
to degrées of preferment; and that I was accurſt, and that
it was a ſhame for me, to remayne thus alwayes in baſe fortune,
and priuat condition. And in the ende (as a diſdaynful
friend) yée conclude, that this cannot come to paſſe, but of an
extréeme ſoft ſpritedneſſe in me, in that I helpe not forward
my fortune as I ſhoulde, putting me in mynde of that auncient
ſentence of the Spartans, that in calling for ayde of God,
it is neceſſary that we ſet to our owne helping hands, as the
inſtruments of God. Truely I know not with what beginning
it were beſt to anſweare this your long maruell, and
tedious complaynt. And beeyng deſirous to doe you a pleaſur,
eit came in my mynde once, to graunt you that which
you affirme to be true; thinking at one inſtaunt, to eaſe my
ſelfe of labour in anſwearing, and you of annoy, in reading
this my troubleſome reply. But I ſhould erre in performing
the duety that is conuenient to a true friend, if eyther to flatter
you, or to auoyde labour; I ſhould not apparantly tel you
that which I thinke.
            Firſt, I know not whether this greatneſſe of fortune y•
yée wiſh me, be a thing that bringeth felicity to a man yea or
no, or whether it take it from him. For y• as the moſt wiſe
&amp; ancient ſages haue ſet down vntovs) there is no man that
perfectly knowes what is good or euil vnto him in this world.
Whervpon Socrates would not that any particular thing

ſhoulde be craued at Gods handes, but that onely, which is
good. And when I looke well about me, I finde not in them
that are aduanced to high degrees, any tranquilitie of mind,
but rather as their dignitie, and greatnes augmenteth, ſo increaſe
they likewiſe in greater perturbations and frettings
of the minde. For it ſeldome or neuer comes to paſſe otherwiſe,
but that with the abundance of the giftes of fortune;
ambition, and greater deſire of honor and riches encreaſe.
Through which the oracle did not iudge any king to be happy,
although he were moſt rich, and mighty; but rather Aglaius
Pſofidius, who manuring a litle peece of grounde that
he had, &amp; taking care of nothing, with great ioy and contentment,
liued a moſt happie and fortunate life. Thoſe that perſiſt
infinitely in the deſire of riches, may bee compared vnto
them which in old time ran to a mighty great mountayne,
with dogs, nets, and other engins with purpoſe to haue taken
the moone, which they verily thought to haue done; but
they that firſt (with great trauel and labour) arriued to the
top of this huge hill, found themſelues ſo farre diſtant, and
no leſſe out of hope, then thoſe wt were climed vp but to ye ſide
of it, or thoſe others, who remoued not from the vally. Tranquilitie
doth not ſpring of thoſe thinges that are without vs,
but of the harmony of a temperate mind within, which doth
truely create felicity in vs, and is the cauſe thereof. For euen
as ſome great piller placed in the bottom of a déepe wel,
is neuertheleſſe great; and a Dwarfe placed on the toppe of
ſome ſtéeple, is alwaies litle: ſo the frée and noble mind wrapped
in baſeſt fortune, wil ſhew his magnanimity, &amp; the baſe
mind in the higheſt degrée of dignity wil diſcouer his vility.
I ſpeake not this now as concerning Chriſtian perfection,
for ye know that making mention hereof, it ſhal not be néedfull
to enter into queſtion; when as neither riches, nor honor
bring happines vnto men, but rather y• one &amp; the other are oftentimes
the occaſions of bringing them into extréeme miſery,
&amp; cauſe the gate of heauen to be ſhut vp agaynſt them. For
the true &amp; onely felicity of a Chriſtian, is the grace of God, &amp;

no other thing. I ſpeak then as a gentleman gouerned by humane
reaſon and ciuil orders, liuing betwixt the law of men
and nature. He verily, which ſées not how that honour &amp; riches
depriue men of felicity, it is manifeſt and apparant, that
he hath his eyes blinded &amp; darkened with the ſmoke of ambition
and cloudes of couetouſneſſe, which are the two beaſts,
compared by the Poet Dante, to a Lion, and a ſhée woolfe,
which let &amp; hinder vs from leaping to the mount of felicity.
I deny not, but that riches &amp; dignity may helpe towards the
contentment of the minde. In this point I will bee a Peripatetike,
and purpoſe not to defend as a Stoike, that onelie
vertue ſufficeth. Let it be ſo, that riches &amp; dignity are requiſite
towards the accōpliſhment of felicity: ſhould it thē haue
no end? Behold Abdolomenus borne of the ſtocke royall liued
in paſſing tranquility, in a litle farme, tilled, and ſowed
with his owne hands, in ſuch ſort that he neuer heard of the
bruit and rumors of the armie of Alexander the great, which
had driuen all Aſia into a maze and aſtoniſhment. He taſted
farre greater felicity in this his poore calling, then when afterwardes
by Epheſtion he was aduanced to the title of the
kingdome. Of whom being demanded how he coulde with
pacience brooke that poore and abiect eſtate, with a hawty &amp;
coragious mind, anſwered him, ſaying; O that I knew ſo
wel (if it pleaſed God) how to ſupport the troubles, &amp; weightines
of the kingdome. Diocleſian a moſt prudent and puiſant
Emperor, hauing wayed and conſidered of the annoyes,
and encombrances that bearing rule, brought with it, returning
to a priuate life, gaue it ouer; and at Salon a manour
of his, he planted hearbes &amp; trées with his owne hands, neyther
could he euer be allured by any perſuaſion, nor remoued
by any occaſiō, frō this his fixed &amp; determinat reſolutiō, preferring
ye quiet trāquility of this priuat life, before ye troubleſome
turmoyles of principalities, &amp; Empires. The like wee
reade of ye emperor Adriā, a moſt puiſant captayne, who by
great trauel &amp; interceſſiō, obtayned licence in the ende of his
dayes, to dwel in a litle village of his, where he liued 7. yéers

in great eaſe and quiet. Who dying, left an apparant teſtimonie,
that the life led in honour and dignity, was not the
true life. For he cauſed theſe woordes to bee graued on his
toombe: Heere lies the wight whoſe age is of many yeeres,
but he liued but onely ſeuen. I coulde heere bring to your
memorie, with how many hatred and enimities the worldly
promotions are inuironed, ſo that nothing is ſure in them,
nothing without ſuſpect, in ſuch ſort that the Poet Pindarus
ſaid that the Gods with one good had alwayes entermixed
twoo euilles. And I dare boldely aduouch that in theſe
ſmokes, and vaine pompes, for euery one contentment, yée
are attached with ten diſpleaſures. But yée know wel that
this place being of the philoſophers moſt largely intreated of,
is of many men not vnderſtoode, of otherſome deſpiſed, of
very fewe beleeued, and almoſt of none followed. But for
the better manifeſting of both our intents) I wil come nearer
vnto you. Be it ſo that riches and honour are full of
theſe felicities, that are commonly beleeued to bee in them,
by them that praiſe them, and holde them in reuerent admiration.
What of this? is it of neceſſitie that it muſt be good
for others alſo? The natures, inſtincts, deſires, and motions
are not equall and alike in all men: either by the influxion
of the ſtarres, or the varietie of temperaments, or diuerſitie
of educations, many thinges delight and recreate ſome one
minde, which woorke contrarie effectes in another: And for
thoſe thinges that Hirachtus wept bitterlie, Democrates
laughed ioyfully. Then is it not greatly to be woondred at,
if thoſe thinges which are comfortable, and nutritiue vnto other
mens mindes, ſéeme noyſome and bitter vnto me? How
many are there that abhorre wine, a moſt healthful and precious
liquor? and how many are there that cannot ſauour
roſes, being flowers moſt delectable? Ought theſe therefore
to be reprooued, and made to drinke wine, and ſmel roſes by
force? And why may I not ſay y• vnto you by the law of nature,
which Alexauder the great did to Parmenio by reaſon
of his fortune? Who propounding a condition of peace

vnto Darius, and profering him a part of his kingdome, demaunded
Parmenio his aduice and iudgement heerein. Who
anſwered, ſaying, if I were Alexander, I woulde doe it. So
woulde I, anſwered Alexander, if I were Parmenio. So
whereas in your letter yee ſay, if that you were my ſelfe, you
woulde doe it, and ſay it: I likewiſe reply and anſwere you
that I ſhoulde peraduenture both ſay it, and doe it, if I were
you. But as Alexander eſteemed it a diſcredit to his fortune
to conſent to ſuch a peace; ſo I account it inconuenient for
my diſpoſition, and nature, to enter, and encomber my ſelfe
with that care and bondage, which yee depaint out vnto me,
whiles ye allure me thervnto with the enticing baites of honour
and riches: yet I would ye ſhould vnderſtande, that I
haue not a minde ſo backewarde and dull, but that I take
comfort of thoſe things, that other men commōly delight in.
Let it be graunted, that it is good for me to be aduaunced to
riches and dignitie: doeth it follow that I ſhould be deſpiſed
or blamed, or diſpaire, and thinke the woorſe of my ſelfe, if
I reach not to that preferment, which might bee deſired, or
hoped for? What woonderings? what complaints are theſe
of yours? as though yée were ignorant, that many thinges
are deſired, that are not obtayned; much hoped for, that is
not inioyed; manie more run, then get the goale: and finally
farre greater are the number of them that ſhoot at a mark,
then thoſe which ſtrike it? May not all this happen of the malignity
of my fortune, which wil not permit or ſuffer me, to
be lifted vp from the ground or aduanced? if it be ſo, is ye fault
mine? Of a truth diuers Aſtrologers, by the view of the day
of my natiuity, haue found out by theyr rules and obſeruances
that moſt vnlucky condition, vnto which I am predeſtinate,
y• is to ſay, cōtinual féeblenes &amp; baſenes of fortune; And
although I am Didimus in y• they ſay, &amp; an heretike in theyr
ſcience (as I haue often told you here in Rome) neuertheles,
in this vnlucky forewarning I haue ouer wel knowen, and
found by experience, y• they haue told me the troth. Yet wil I
not lay the blame hereof vpon fortune, as on a dumbe image

that cānot anſwere to the accuſations that are brought in againſt
her, let it be graunted that the chiefeſt parte of humaine
proceedinges, are directed by mans wiſedome, and
let him be (as the wiſeman affirmeth) the framer of his own
fortune. What ſhoulde I then doe? with what inſtruments
(I pray you) woulde you haue me to frame and faſhion this
my good happe? with remaining long in Rome, and looking
for occaſions? it is now twentie and fiue yeeres ſithence I
came firſt into this court, and I thinke that in this long ſeaſon,
I was neuer three miles diſtant, and yet neither haue I
any good or fortunate ſucceſſe by my ſeruice, neither ſtande
in hope of anie. Yet haue I been a continuall waiter, &amp; was
neuer almoſt at libertie, wherof it greatly repenteth me: not
for that the ſeruice of noble men little liked me: but rather becauſe
ye iniquitie of fortune hath (by my lōg courting) brought
me into ſuch a miſerable ſeruitude and ſlauerie, that no good
reſolution of mind can enter into me. I haue heertofore done
too much, but I tel you that hereafter, neither will I, nor can
I, neither is it conuenient that I doe it, this is a practiſe for
yong men, &amp; not of old men, amongſt which number I nowe
reckon my ſelfe. Young men abound in leaſure, and trauell
ſeemeth not tedious vnto them, which wanteth in old men,
vnto whom euerie little diſcontentment is a torment. And as
gracious and ſéemely as it is to ſée a yong man attendant on
ſome noble man: ſo vnſéemely &amp; ridiculous is it, to ſée an olde
man.
            Truely the lōg loſſe of time that is ſpent in courting, is to me
verie noyſō: and chiefly in that I ſtand there, as an image or
paynted table. And rather would I employ it eyther in reaſoning,
 wt my friēds or in learning, amōgſt my books, or in pleaſuring
or profiting others, by my ſtudies; &amp; this is a laudable
meanes, wherby to mount to thoſe degrées of dignitie that ye
propound vnto me. But alas, if y• nature hath geuen me ſmal
wit, not ouer great memory, weake iudgement (&amp; y• which
more gréeueth me) vnhealthfulnes of ſtomake; ſorenes of eies
&amp; euery other part of my body il affected, what can I doe here

in? it might here vnto be added, that at this preſent I am
toſſed with ſuch ſundry miſhaps, that they neuer permit me
quietly to encline my mind to ſtudy. Wherof ye deſire onely is
left me, my forces being inſufficient any longer to vndertake
any ſuch trauell. Wherfore if I doe not and cannot ariue vnto
this prayſe, let the torment and anoy (I pray you) that I
taſt and ſuffer in being depriued of that ſwéete conſolation,
which ſtudie bringes with it, ſuffice, without adding newe
griefes vnto me, of the priuation of my deſarts; what I knew
to doe, I haue done, no more coulde I doe.
            And I aſſure my ſelfe, that although for learning I can
challenge no commendation, yet am I not vnworthy of ſome
excuſe, in that I haue alwayes taken a ſingular delight, to ſée
theſe things in other, y• I find wanting in my ſelfe; I haue loued,
reuerenced, and as it were, adored them. Neither did I
euer account any more worthy of the titles of honour and dignity,
then thoſe which haue lifted vp their vnderſtandings to
beautifull contemplations, through which theyr mindes are
repleniſhed with vertuous wiſedome. And I haue put ſuch
betwixt theſe men and others, as is betwixt the liuing, and
thinges paynted.
            But you wil peraduēture, demād me whether I meane it
of thoſe that are vertuous indéede, or of ſuch as counterfaite a
certayne outward hypocriticall ſhewe of vertue: doe not ſo
much as ſurmiſe it, I beſéech you, that I ſpeake it of the fayned.
For my nature doeth deteſt nothing more then counterfayte
vertue, and rather would I make choyce to die, then
deceaue the worlde, in enforcing my ſelfe to be holden for deuoute,
when as I am neyther good, nor godly. And I beléeue
for troth, that there are no men in this world more pernicious,
nor greater enemies to our ſauiour Chriſt, then are
ſuch hipocrites.
            But as touching true boūty indéed, I tel you for certaine, y•
I think nothing more pertinēt vnto a mā thē it, &amp; ſo far forth
I déeme it proper vnto him, that a man leauing it, &amp; geuing

himſelfe ouer to wickednes, is no more to be counted a man,
but that rather vnder his humane ſhape, hee carrieth the
minde of a bruite beaſt. Nowe it ſéemeth not vnto me that
bounty ſhould be vſed for the hope of reward, but rather for
the band of humanity, and loue and deſire to doe well. And it
ſhineth ſo much the brighter in any man, by how much he is
not led aſtray by any other ende, then goodneſſe it ſelfe. Of
which if any ſparkle be in me, eyther by nature, or election,
it is not to be maruelled at if it want the reward yée look for;
in that firſt, I know very well, that not onely by the vniuerſal
humaine debility, but by that which is proper and peculiar
to my ſelfe, I finde it ſo ſlender in me, that of it ſelfe, it geueth
no light at all; Farther, I neuer directed it to the end to
receiue guerdon by it, being an excerciſe (in my opinion) farre
different from the neate and pure condition of being good. I
tel you truely that I haue and doe receaue a farre greater rewarde
then that yée deſire in me. For that litle which I féele
in my ſelfe, makes me taſt, how much the life of the good, is
more bleſſed then that of the wicked: How this aboundes in
ſwéetneſſe, tranquillity and conſolation; how that is ye ſpring
and fountaine of al feares, hatreds, debates, vexations &amp; trauels.
In ſuch ſort that when a man wil not, for Gods ſake do
the déedes of an honeſt man, &amp; good Chriſtian; yet me thinks
at the leaſtwiſe he ſhould doe it for the quiet &amp; comfort that
is taſted thereby in this worlde. But you will tell mee
that rewardes enſue vertue, as the ſhadowe followeth
the bodie.
            Nowe, as the body béeyng not made too the ende to bring
foorth the ſhadowe, neuertheleſſe bringeth it foorth: ſo
vertue is the cauſe that rewarde is obtayned, although
it be not ſought for, or vſed to that end.
            You would haue mée confeſſe it, &amp; I grant it alſo, that I am
not arriued, through ye mortification of my body, &amp; quickning
of ye ſpirit, to that high degrée and ſpirituall vnion, with
which the olde diuine fathers, conioyned themſelues to God;

neither am I yet come to that chriſtian perfection, which
was required in the Hebrewe youngman. I haue not
ſolde that little which I haue, and giuen it to the poore:
neither haue I denied my ſelfe, nor taken Chriſt his croſſe
on my ſhoulders, and followed him. What more? that in
ſlacke obſeruing of the commaundements of Gods lawe, I
neither merit, nor haue deſerued the title of a perfect Chriſtian;
for that many occurrences haue happened, which
haue cauſed mée to wander wide from theſe diuine obſeruations.
            What farther? that (ſetting chriſtianitie aparte) I am
not (as a morall Philoſoper) arriued to that excellencie of
manners, which are fitting and conuenient for a purifyed
minde, as in times paſt was knowne to bée in Ariſtides, in
Socrates, in Phocion, and diuers others, with moſt apparant
examples of iuſtice, temperance, and fortitude, and other
rare and diuine vertues. But rather my doubt is, that
(as a man that is not gouerned by any learning, but lyueth
onely by the inſtinct of nature) I want greatly that, which
is requiſite for that eſtate: through which I know not how
to chalenge vnto my ſelf theſe prayſes, which my conſcience
telles mée I am vnworthy of. And finally, as of no part I
déeme my ſelfe praiſewoorthy: ſo, if there bée any thing in
mée, that doth not altogether deſerue praiſe, it is this: that
I haue had a care in what I might, not to iniurie others:
then I haue done mine endeuour (when occaſion hath béene
offred mée) to pleaſure and gratifie as many as I might,
being induced thereunto by Nature, perſwaded by precepts
of good writers, and confirmed therein by iudgement, which
hath imprinted a ſetled reſolution in my minde: and this I
account to bée the chiefe fountaine, from which al other vertues
(that maintaine humaine ſocietie amongſt vs) firſt flow
and procéede.
            Now, if thoſe vertues that are requiſite to the aduauncing
of mée to the degrées of riches and honour, be not in me: wil
ye meruaile if I be not aduaunced? And if there be any ſuch

in me, wherfore doe yée reprehend me? ought I, in not deſeruing
thoſe degrées, to haue them; and deſeruing them, to bée
reprehended for not hauing them? If I deſerue them not, for
Gods ſake let mée liue with ſo many others my equalls,
ſubiect to the like fortune, and adde not the ſinne of arrogancie,
to the want of deſart. For it is a fooliſh and preſumptuous
part for a man to aſpyre to thoſe degrées, of
which hée knowes him ſelfe vnworthy. But if it ſéeme vnto
you y• I haue deſerued thē, it had bene your part rather to cō
               fort
mée, thē reprehend me, &amp; ye might haue ſaid, y• oftētimes
my betters haue beene depriued of the fruites of their deſart
and prayſe that they haue merited; and that it is much better
to deſerue an honour, then to haue it. For honour may bée
receaued by the will of him that giues it, vertue not being
the guide of it: But no man can deſerue it, but y• vertue muſt
firſt make a way to the deſart. Héerevnto the example
of Cato myght bée added, who would rather that it ſhould
bée demaunded, wherefore Images were not ſet vp to Cato,
then why they were ſet vp.
            And if now it ſéeme ſtraunge vnto you, that more then
two hundred are gone beyonde mée, in pre
                  •
               erment; yée ought
in the beſt part to enterprete ſuch accidentes, and héerein
imitate the example of Pedaretus, a valiant man with
the Spartans, who amongſt thrée hundred that bare office in
their Citie,, not being elected for one, ioyed greatly: who
being demaunded (of his friende Ephorus) the cauſe of his
gladneſſe, pleaſauntly aunſwered; what ſhould I doe, but
bée ioyfull, ſéeing that there are thrée hundred men in our
Citie, better then my ſelfe? ſo ſhoulde you reioyce of Rome
in hauing ſo many good men that excell mée. And ye ought
to wiſh, that not onely two hundred, but fiue hundred, a
thouſand; yea thrée thouſand men ſhould paſſe mée in vertue,
and wiſedome, and by conſequence, in fortune and
honour: through which I déeme it would come to paſſe, that
this our Realme ſhould bée much more floriſhing and honourable,
then now it is.
            
               
I doe not ſeeme to my ſelfe to bee ſuch a one, as ſhould
deſerue thoſe dignities that yee wiſhe mee: but bee it that I
had many of theſe partes, which you cal deſart in me, neuertheleſſe
neither coulde I, nor ſhoulde I haue any of theſe honours
but by fauour: in that I ſtande aſſured that the fountaine
from whence theſe preferments flowe, is beyonde and
aboue all our merites and deſartes. But in the ende, I
know you wil ſay, that beeing often conuerſant with them,
in requeſting, and beeing importunate, I might haue obteined
riches, and dignitie, and that this is the meanes that
hath holpen, and doeth helpe a number dayly, and that it is
the very ſame whereof mention is made by Chriſte in his
Goſpel, when hee ſaith, Aſke, and it ſhall bee giuen you;
knocke, and it ſhalbe opened. What ſhal I anſwere heerevnto?
but that not deſeruing it, it ſeemeth an vnaduiſed part
of mée to craue rewarde, &amp; deſeruing it, mée thinks it ſhould
come without aſking. As I haue ſaide, ſo will I ſay, that
I knowe not whether I haue deſerued it or no.
            Now, if there bee any that thinkes mée worthy of any
thing, let him requeſt it for mée: but not by my commaundement.
For if I knew that I deſerued it a thouſande
times, yet would I not bée ſo ſhameleſſe and impudent to
demaund it. For I haue not directed my operations to
that end, that I ſhould craue guerdon for them; beſides
that, it is not conuenient for a Gentleman ſo to doe.
            What farther? that it is a thing cleane repugnaunt to
my nature and diſpoſition, and in the crauing thereof I
ſhould bée ſo colde and timerous, that (as the Prouerbe
ſaieth) I ſhould teach others to denie mée. For I being
vnable to demaund any thing, without ſpéech of ſome
deſart of mine, how ſhall this be done without arrogancie,
when as I knowe none to bee in me? And if there
were any, could I ſpeake of it my ſelfe, without bluſhing?
            
               
To conclud, I think it neither good, profitable, nor honeſt for
me.
            Thus I pray you, iudge of me, that although I haue no
great ſubſtance of ſound vertue: yet want I not ſome little
ſhadow of decent modeſtie. Neither would I haue you
wiſh me to become a new Satibarſanes, with Araxzrxes, or
Turinus, with Alexander. And of this reſolue your ſelfe,
that it for theſe twentie and fiue yeares, I haue with a bold
courage, knowne how to tollerate many ſtrokes of Fortune:
I hope alſo with like fortitude to ouerpaſſe the
reſt of the time that God hath appoynted mée to liue in this
world: and ſhall (perhappes) taſt greater tranquillitie in
this my poore and meane calling, then a number of others
doe, with their riches and honour.
            To conclude, I know this your aduice to procéede of an
incredible affection that yée beare mée, but yet I purpoſe not
to put it in practiſe, nor followe it: but as Marius, when that

            A tranſlation out of french, of a Supplication
preſented by Iohn Meſchinot, Eſquire, vnto the
Duke of Brittane his Lorde and Maiſter, wherein
he nameth himſelfe the Baniſhed from
Ioyfulneſſe, by
H. G.
            
               MOſt humbly complayneth vnto your honour,
your poore vaſſayle, loyall ſubiect,
and obedient ſeruant, The baniſhed from
ioyfulneſſe, remayning in the dioceſſe of
miſfortune, the pariſh
                  •
               oner of affliction,
and néere neighbour of diſpaire: giuing
you to vnderſtand, howe from his young
yeares, hée hath continually ſerued my Lords your predeceſſours,
whoſe ſoules God hath receiued: And whome it hath
pleaſed you (for which I yéelde you humble thankes) to entertaine
amongſt the number of them, which are of your
ſpeciall ſauegarde and protection. Neuertheleſſe, a théefe,
(the common enemie of humaine creatures) named Miſhappe,
remaining alwayes with Fortune, accompanied
with an olde leane woman, called Pouertie, haue vnceſſantly
warred, and almoſt in euery place purſued your ſaid ſupplyant,
tending to his totall deſtruction: whoſe rage and furie
hath vntill this preſent béene reſiſted by the good ayde and
ſupport, that it hath pleaſed you, and your honourable aunceſtors
to make for him. And it is ſo (Souereigne ſir) that
although in times paſt, the Baniſhed from ioyfulneſſe hath
béene cruelly handled, and ſharpely aſſayled by the forenamed
Miſhappe and Pouertie: yet at this preſent, they
haue taken and bound him, in ſuch lamentable ſorte,

that without your ſpéedie ayde and ſuccour, hée cannot long
indure to reſiſt their malice. And for the better bringing
of their purpoſe to paſſe, they haue firſt diſpoyled your ſayde
ſupplyant of fiftie yeares, and more, which he had receiued
of God and nature, being depriued of all hope, of euer recouering
any of them againe. And in this ſorte, as a ſlaue or
bondman, doe they detaine him againſt his wil. And for
his farther puniſhment, they haue giuen expreſſe commandement,
and deliuered it ſtrictly in charge to Furie, Sorow,
thought &amp; vexatiō
                being their armorers, to forge for y• ſaid baniſhed
frō ioyfulnes a ſtrōg &amp; weightie armor of proof, double
ſodored, the ſtuffe thereof being of the ſtéele or melancholy;
The ſmythy or hearth wheron they heate, it is Langor,
which is kindled wt the fire of fretting, from whence yſſues ſo
great flame, and ſmoke of anger &amp; furie, occaſioned through
the wind, procéeding from the bellowes of ſighinges and
gronings, as it is a thing moſt horrible to expreſſe. And God,
thou knoweſt, how ſowre moſt vgly and hideous olde women,
that is to ſay Impatience, Lamentation, Iniurie, and
Miſerie, continually ſtrike and beate on it, on the anuill of
anguiſh, with the hammers of Rygour. Afterwardes
they temper the ſaid armour with the water of bitterneſſe,
néere the which leapes forth a ſalte riuer of trickling teares,
taking his courſe through the vallie of ſhame, ouernéere the
ſorowfull aboade of your ſaid ſupplyant: ſo that oftentimes
through the ſuperabundaunce of raine and ſhowers of ſorowe,
the waters of diſquiet and controuerſie growe and
flowe ſo hye, that the village of his heart is, as it were
all drowned.
            It reſteth to tell you how they ſcowre, and make bright
this harneſſe. They haue a great grinding ſtone of torment,
turnde about by féebleneſſe and ſlaunder on the one ſide, and
ruine and confuſion on the other ſide. The maiſters of
this worke, are Daunger, Debate, and diſpleaſure, which
often beſprinckle the ſaid harneſſe with the powder or ſparkduſt

of rage, making therewith a blacke verniſh. With
this armour of proofe haue they determined to arme your
foreſaid ſuppliant, vppon a doublet of dolor, tyed on by trauell,
with the poyntes of diſcomfort, and their purpoſe is to
make him carie it on foote through the darke kingdome of
ſolytarineſſe, to warre againſt felicitie. And I verily think,
y• in the end, they will take from him the power to doe you any
longer ſeruice (which I beſéech your honor, moſt ſouereine
Lord, not to permit) for neither they, nor any other
whatſoeuer, ſhall neuer bée able to take from him the deſire
that hée hath ſtill to ſerue you.
            Now it is ſo, that a notable and reuerent Ladie called old
Age▪ (ſéeing into what miſerie and captiuitie the foreſayde
Miſhappe and Pouertie haue brought your ſaide ſupplyant)
hath promyſed and determined ſhortly to deliuer him out
of their handes, and in the meane ſeaſon will keepe him
good and comfortable company, vntill the ende of his daies,
ſo that hée may obtaine your good fauour and aſſiſtaunce.
For otherwiſe wanting wherwith to ſupply his neceſſities,
hée cannot bée reſtored to his fréedome.
            Might it ſtand therefore with your good pleaſure (moſt ſouereigne
Lord) to commaund Honour the procurer generall
of your enterpriſes, to ſtand with your ſayde ſupplyant,
and take ſuch order in this behalf, that his forenamed enimies
may bée expulſed, and that hée no longer remaine beſéeged
with ſuch iminent diſtruction. Conſider that this ryot
hath béene made, whiles I remained vnder your ſauegard
and in your ſeruice.
            Laſtly therefore, theſe are moſt humbly to pray and beſéech
you, ſo to ordaine for the eſtate of the baniſhed from ioyfulneſſe,
that hee may with ioy and contentment finiſh and
accompliſhe the ſhorte time that hee hath to lyue in this
worlde.
            
               
In ſo doing yée ſhall reforme him, both in chaunging his
name, and the place of his aboad; ſo will hée more and more
enforce himſelfe, to dwell néerer your pallace, to doe you loial
ſeruice to his power, during life: making continuall interceſſion
to god, y• he may graunt you peace and repoſe of ſpirit,
eaſe and health of bodie, honour, good and long life; with all
that your noble heart wiſheth, and heauen for your finall inheritaunce.
         
         
            Tranſlated out of Italian.
            Twoo ſworne Brothers, being ſouldiers, maried twoo ſiſters:
the one of them made much of his wife, entreating
her with all lenitie that might be, yet would ſhee
not obey his will and pleaſure: The other threatned
his wife, and kept her in obedience, and ſhe alwayes
did, what he commaunded her. The one requeſteth
the other, to teach him 
                  •
               ow to make her obediente,
which he did, wherevppon hee threatning and vſing
her as the other did, ſhee laught him to ſcorne.
            
               THere dwelt in times paſt, in a gariſon
néere adioyning to Rome, two ſworn brothers,
who no leſſe loued one the other,
then if they had yſſued out of one womb:
of which the one had to name Siluerius, the
other was called Piſardus, and both of
them by profeſſion were ſouldiers: although
their amitie was great, yet they dwelt not in one
houſe. Siluerius, the younger wanting a gouerneſſe for his
houſe, tooke to wife the daughter of a taylour, being named
Spinella, a gallant and bewtifull mayden, but of a high,

and lofty diſpoſition. The marriage being ended, &amp; the wife
being brought home to his houſe, he was ſo feruētly inamoured
on her beauty, that he thought there was not any woman
in the world, able to goe beyond her: and in this his doting
moode, ſuffered her to ſay and doe what ſhe liſted, &amp; gaue
her euery thing that ſhée demanded: through which Spine Ila
became ſo bolde, and heddy, that ſhée litle or nothing eſtéemed
her huſband; &amp; the ignorant fot was now come to ſuch a
paſſe, that when he willed her to doe one thing, ſhée would go
about another thing, &amp; bidding her to come hither, ſhe would
goe a cleane contrary way, and laugh him to ſcorne. And her
huſband being none of the wiſeſt, dared neither to remedy it,
nor to reprehend her, but ſuffered her in euery thing to doe,
what beſt pleaſed her fancie. Within a yéere after, Piſardus
was married to another daughter of the foreſaide Taylour,
who was called Fiorella, béeing full out as beautifull as her
ſiſter, but inferiour to her in brauery, &amp; ſuttlety of wit. The
nuptials being finiſhed, and the wife brought home to his
houſe, Piſardus tooke a paire of bréeches, and two cudgels, ſaying
vnto her,
            
               Fiorella, theſe are the bréeches of a man, take you one of
theſe ſtaues, and I wil haue the other; and wee will try
by combate, which of vs ſhal carry away the bréeches; on this
condition, that he which ſhalbe conquerer, ſhal haue them; &amp;
he that ſhalbe ouercome ſhall alwayes remayne obedient to
the Conquerour.
            
               Fiorella hearing theſe words of her huſband, without any
delay, readily aunſweared with great humility: Alas, my
huſband, what meane yée by theſe ſpéeches that yée vtter? are
not you the huſband, and I the wife? Ought not the wife alwaies
to be obedient to her huſband? How ſhoulde I euer
then commit ſuch a folly? Now carry you the bréeches and
weare them, for they belong more vnto you, and will better
become you, then me.
            I wil then (anſwered Piſardus) ſtill weare the bréeches, &amp;
be the huſband, and thou as my beloued wife, ſtand obedient

vnto me. But take héede, that yée alter not your determination,
in ſéeking to make your ſelfe the huſband, and me the
wife, for that after it ſhall repent you.
            
               Fiorella, who was wiſe, confirmed that he had ſpoken, and
at the ſame inſtant, her huſband gaue her the gouernment of
al his houſe; then ſaid he, wife I will bring thée to my ſtable
and ſhew thée my horſes, for that thou maiſt know what order
to take for them, if I ſhall chaunce to be abſent. And being
come thither, ſaid, Fiorella, how like ye theſe my geldings? are
they not fayre? are they not gallant, and in good plight? To
whom ſhée anſwered; they are in déede, Sir, but behold (ſayd
Piſardus) how ready, and obedient they are: and taking a
wande, touched now the one, and nowe the other, ſaying;
Holla, hoyſt, come aloft, and they ſhewed themſelues moſt obedient
to theyr maiſter. Amongſt the reſt, Piſardus had one
horſe, fayre enough to the eye, but very dogged of diſpoſition,
which was the cauſe that he litle eſtéemed him; comming vnto
him with the rod in his hand, he ſaid; come here; come there;
and ſtrake him; but the horſe being by nature knauiſh, ſuffered
his maiſter to lay on him, not doing any thing of that hée
bad him, but that he kickt and ſpurnde at him, now with
one foot, now with both. Piſardus ſéeing his crabbedneſſe, with
a great and tough cudgel beate him a good, but all preuayled
not. Which his maiſter ſéeyng, being kindled in choler, ſet hād
to his ſword that he had by his ſide, in the preſence of Fiorella,
ran him through, &amp; killed him; wherat ſhée being moued with
compaſſion, ſaid, alas my huſband, why haue yée killed this
horſe? He was very faire, and it is great pitie ſo to kill him.
Piſardus with a troubled countenance, anſweared, I let you
vnderſtand, that al they, which eate that is mine, and doe not
what I bid them, ſhalbe payde with the ſame money. Fiorella
hearing this anſweare, was very penſiue, and ſayd within
her ſelfe, Alas, ſorowful creature, &amp; wretch that I am, in ill
time came I hither, I thought that I had a wiſe man too my
huſband, but now I ſee I haue happened on a beaſt. Sée how

for litle or nothing he hath killed a gallāt horſe. Thus remained,
ſhée very penſiue in her ſelfe, not knowing to what ende
her huſband ſpake it. Through which Fiorella was ſo exceedingly
afrighted, and ſtoode in ſuch awe of him euer after, that
when ſhée heard him but ſtirre, ſhée would trēble for feare, &amp;
whatſoeuer he willed her to doe, it was accompliſhed preſētly,
and ſcantly could her huſband open his mouth to ſpeake,
before ſhe vnderſtood him, &amp; there was neuer any contention,
or brawling heard betwixt thē. Siluerius who loued his friend
Piſardus paſſing well, oftentimes came to viſite him, and
would dine and ſuppe with him, who noting the mild demeanour
&amp; modeſt behauiour of Fiorella, maruelled greatly, ſaying
within himſelfe. O God, why was it not my hap to haue
takē 
               Fiorella to wife, as wel as my brother Piſardo? Sée how
ſhée gouernes the houſe, and doth what he commandeth her
moſt obediently. But mine (wretche that I am) doeth cleane
contrary, not affoording me neyther a good word, nor chéereful
countenance vnleſſe ſhée may haue her owne will in euery
thing:
            
               Siluerius on a certayne day walking alone with Piſardus,
and debating of diuers matters, amongſt other communication,
he ſaid. Brother Piſardus, thou knoweſt the loue and goodwill
that hath long remayned betwixt vs. I would willingly
learne of you, what meanes yée vſed at the firſt, in bringing
your wife to ſuch obedience and to winne her to make ſo
much of you. I can neuer ſo louingly commaund Spinella to
doe any thing, but ſhe anſweares me ouerthwartly, and herewith
doeth al things contrary to that I bid her.
            
               Piſardus ſmyling hereat, from poynt to poynt tolde him,
the order and meanes that he had vſed when he brought her
firſt to his houſe, perſuading him to doe the like, and prooue
whether it woulde take effect, which if it did not, hee
knewe not what aduiſe to geue him. This liked Siluerius
very well, who taking his leaue of his friende

and beyng come home to his houſe, without any delay called
for his wife, and taking a payre of his owne bréeches, and a
couple of ſtaues, did as his friend Piſardus had coūſelled him.
Which Spinella ſéeing, ſaid vnto him. What new thing, Siluerius,
is this that yée are about to doe? What buzzes are
there put in your head? Are you now become a foole? Doe
we not know, thinke you; that men, and not women, ſhould
weare bréeches? and what neceſſity is there I pray you, in
doing theſe thinges, ſo beſides the purpoſe? but Siluerius making
no anſwere, procéeded in his determinate order, geuing
her the rule and gouernment of his houſe.
            
               Spinella maruelling heereat, cuttedly ſaide vnto him.
Think you that I cannot doe theſe things ſufficiently without
theſe your godly inſtructions that you ſo hotly geue mée?
But her huſband held his peace, and going with his wife to
the ſtable, did the like to his horſes, that Piſardo had done before,
and killed one; Spinella ſéeing ſuch fondnes, thought verily
that he was beſides himſelfe, and ſaide vnto him, Alas,
I pray you tel me Sir, what mad moodes are theſe? what is
there come in your braine? What is there meant by theſe
vnaduiſed parts y• yée play? Are yée witleſſe? Siluerius anſwered.
I am neither mad nor fooliſh. But all they that liue at
my charge, and doe not obey me, ſhalbe chaſticed in like ſorte
as yée haue nowe ſéene.
            
               Spinella perceruing to what end this was done by her vnwiſe
huſband, 
                  •
               aid vnto him: Ah ſot that thou art. It ſéemeth
wel that thy horſe was a ſimple beaſt, to ſuffer himſelf ſo miſerably
to be killed at thy hāds. But what meane yée by this?
Thinke yée to doe that vnto me, which ye haue done to your
horſe? in truth; if ye ſo thinke yée, are deceaued greatly: and ouerlate
it is now to looke vnto that, which yee woulde looke
vnto.
            The bone is ouer muche hardēned; the wound is nowe
growne to a ſcarre: neyther is there nowe any remedy. Order
ſhould ſooner haue beene taken with this your ſtraunge
maner of coniuration, O foole, O witleſſe Gooſe, doeſt thou

not ſée that thou ſuſtaineſt both loſſe &amp; ſcorne by theſe innumerable

                  •
               ollies? And what gayne yée hereby? In good fayth,
nothing. Siluerius hearing the wordes of his ſuttle wife, &amp; ſéeyng
his louing purpoſe like to come to no effect, determined
againſt his will, paciently to ſuffer this his harde fortune,
till death ſhould ende theſe his dolours. And Spinella ſéeing
her huſbands counſel not to preuaile, whereas ſhée tooke an
inche of liberty before, tooke an Ell afterwardes. For a woman
that is by nature obſtinate, had rather ſuffer a thouſand
deathes, then alter her ſetled determination.
         
         
            ¶Maiſter Gaſparinus a Phiſition,
by his cunning, healeth fooles.
            
               
                  THere dwelt in times paſt in Englande, a
very rich man who had one only ſonne, called
Gaſparinus, whom he ſent ouer too the
vniuerſity of Padua, that he might there
follow his ſtudie: but hee making no account
of learning, ſpēt his time in gaming
and rioting, haunting brothel houſes, and other
ſuſpected places, leading ye moſt diſſolute life that might
be: His father thinking that he ſpent his time in the ſtudy of
Phiſicke; he practized in ſtéed of bookes, bowles; for diſputing
di
                  •
               ing; and whereas he ſhould haue attayned learning, he altogether
frequēted loytring. Hauing remayned there ye ſpace
of fiue yéeres, he returned into his countrey and ſhewed by experience
y• he had learned backwards, for going about to ſéem
a Romaine, he manifeſted himſelfe to be a Barbarian; and
men noted him and poynted at him, as a common laughing
ſtocke, in the towne where he dwelt. What griefe it was vnto

the poore father to ſée his coſt loſt, and his onely childe as it
were caſt away, I referre the conſideration thereof to your
diſcretions. Wherfore for the mitigating of his ſorowes, hée
called his ſonne vnto him, and opening a cheſt full of money
and iewels, layde forth vnto him the one halfe of his goodes
(which verily he deſerued not) &amp; ſaid, Take here (my ſonne)
thy portion of thy fathers hereditamentes, &amp; get thée farre frō
me; For I rather chooſe to remain without a child, then to liue
with thée in infamie. No ſooner were theſe words ſpoken, but
he moſt willingly obeying his fathers commandement fingering
the money, tooke his leaue &amp; departed. And being farre diſtant
from him, at the entrance of a wood néere a riuer, hée
built a coſtly &amp; ſumptuous pallace, the gates being of braſſe,
and with this riuer it was moated about. Herein with a deuice
of ſluces he made certayne litle pooles, whoſe depth hée
woulde encreaſe or diminiſh at his pleaſure. Into ſome, the
water entred the depth of a man; into ſome other, y• it would
reach to his eyes; others, vnto the nauel, ſome to the middle, &amp;
ſome to the knées; &amp; vnto euery of theſe pooles, an yron chaine
was faſtened. Ouer the gate of this pallace was a title written,
which ſayd, A place, wherein to heale fooles. The fame of
this pallace, in ſhort ſpace, was ſpread abrode in moſt places
of the world, &amp; fooles repayred thither in great abundance, to
be cured, but (to ſpeake more néerer the troth) to bée waſhed.
The maiſter according to the greatnes of their follies, would
plundge them in theſe pits, and ſome of theſe he would heale
with whippings, ſome with watching, ſome with faſting, &amp;
other ſome by little &amp; litle he would reſtore to their former eſtate,
&amp; vnderſtanding, by the tēperature &amp; ſuttlety of y• ayre.
On a time in a large court, without the gates of this pallace,
as certayne of the meaneſt ſort of theſe fooles, were ſporting
themſelues in the heate of the ſunne, it fortuned that a Falconer came
by, which carried a ſparhawk on his fiſt, hauing a
great number of Spaniels wayting on him. Who preſently
beyng eſpird by theſe fooles, they maruelled greatly what he
meant to ride with that birde and ſpaniels: and one of them

demanded of him what bird it was that he carried on his fiſt?
He anſwered, a Sparhawke. And to what end (quoth he) doe
yée kéepe her? (quoth the Gentleman) ſhée is a birde gréedy at
her pray, and I keepe her to kill Partridge with, which is a
great bird, and delicate in taſt: theſe are called ſpaniels which
ſpring and retrine the birdes, &amp; this ſparhauke killeth them,
and I eate them. Quoth the 
                  •
               oole then: I pray doe tel me what
this Sparhawke &amp; Spaniels ſtand thée in? The Falconer
made anſweare, I bought the horſe that I ride on, for ſixe
pound, the Sparhawke coſt mée twenty ſhillings, &amp; my Spaniels
thrée pouud: and the féeding and nouriſhing of all theſe
yéerely, I value at xx. pounds. Now I beſéech thée tell mée
ſaid the foole how many Partridges thou takeſt yéerely, and
what they bée woorth. I catch (quoth he) about two hundred,
and they are at the leaſt, woorth twenty ſhillings. The foole,
but not a foole herin, but rather he ſhewed himſelf very wiſe,
with a loude voyce cried vnto him, fly, fly, foole that thou art,
which ſpendeſt twenty pound yéerely, for the gaining of twē
               ty
ſhillings, and yet reckoneſt not the time, that is vaynely
conſumed. Fly with al ſpéede, for the paſſion of God, fly, for
if my maiſter finde thée héere, he will throw thée into a pitte,
where thou ſhalt be plunged ouer head &amp; eares, &amp; be ſuffered
hardly to eſcape with life. For I which am a f
                  •
               ole, may diſcerne
that thou art more fooliſh then them which are moſt
fooliſh of all.

Bergamaſke, bring all their Doctors to a diſputation,
and they of the citie of Bergamaſke, with a prety pollicie
confuted, and had the victorie of the Florentines.
            
               IN times paſt, it happened that diuers Merchants
of Florentine and Bergamaſke, met:
who riding together (as it often chanceth)
had talk and conference of diuers matters,
and digreſſing from one thing too another,
one of the Florentines ſayde, Truely you
of Bergamaſke (as farre as I can perceiue)
are dull ſprited, and men of ſmall capacity, and were it not
for that litle traffique of merchandiſe that yée practize, for the
great groſeneſſe and vnaptneſſe that is in you, yée were good
for nothing. And it comes to paſſe, that yée haue proſperous
ſucceſſe in marchandiſe, not for any ſkil that ye haue, or dexteritie
of witte, but for the greedines, and couetouſnes of gain,
that is in you. For I knowe not any that may goe beyonde
you, in groſeneſſe and blockiſhneſſe. Hauing thus ſpoken,
one of the citie of Bergamaſke, ſtept foorth and made him anſwere,
ſaying: And I tell thée that we of Bergamaſke in all
poyntes, are able to goe beyond you. And albéeit you Florentines
are ſmoothly tounged, &amp; bring greater delight with
your fyled ſpéech, to the eares of the hearers, then we: neuertheleſſe
in all other thinges yée are farre inferiour vnto vs, &amp;
if yée conſider it wel, there is not one amongſt vs, be hee great
or litle, but hath ſome ſmacke in learning; and herewith we
are apt to euery couragious enterpriſe, which is not found in
you, or if it bée, it is in very few of you.
            
               
The contention growing to bée very great, both of the one
ſide, and the other, they of the Citie of Bergamaſke not entending

them, euery one defending his owne ſide with great ſtoutneſſe,
one of Bergamaſke ſtoode vp, and ſaide. To what end
are all theſe wordes? Let vs make proofe of it by déedes.
Let a ſolemne diſputation be appoynted, wherat ye flowre of
learning, and doctors may méete, and then ſhall it manifeſtly
bée ſéene, which of vs is moſt excellent. Héerevnto the
Florentines yéelded their conſent: but this was the differēce;
whether ye 
               Florentines ſhould go to Bergamaſke, or they
of Bergamaſk to Florence. After many words, it was cōcluded
y• they ſhould caſt lots. And it ſo fel out, ye the Florentines
muſt go to the Cittie of Bergamaſke. The day of diſputation
was nominated to bée in the moneth of May. The
Merchantes returned to their Cities; and acquainted their
Doctors, and other learned men what match they had made
                  •
               
who vnderſtanding the matter, were very well pleaſed, and
made prouiſion for a gallant and long diſputation.
            They of the Towne of Bergamaſke, as wiſe and ſubtill
men, determined to worke ſo, that the Florentines ſhould remaine
both confuted and ſcorned. Wherefore all the moſt
learned men of the Citie being aſſembled, as well Grammarians
as Rhetoricians; and wel common lawieres, as Canoniſtes,
as well Philoſophers, as diuines, and Doctours
and maiſters of all other ſortes whatſoeuer, they made
choyce of the chiefeſt of them, and retained them in theyr
Citie, that they might bée their rocke and ſortreſſe in theyr
diſputation againſt the Florentines. The others being apparelled
in courſe and ragged apparell, againſt the day of
the diſputations, they ſent forth of the Citie, towardes that
parte where the Florentines muſt néedes come. And charge
was giuen, that they ſhould ſpeake nothing vnto them but
Latine.
            Theſe Doctors being thus attirde in clowniſh apparell,

and intermixt amongſt them, of pollicie, they ſet handes vnto
diuers exerciſes: ſome digged ditches, ſome caryed wood,
and ſome did one thing, and ſome an other.
            Theſe Doctors of Bergamaſke remayning in theſe exerciſes,
and ſeeming to bée clownes, beholde the Florentine
Doctors came ryding by with great pompe, who ſéeing theſe
labourers, ſayde vnto them, God ſaue you brethren. To
whome the clownes anſwered in latine, Benè veniant tanti
viri. The Florentines thinking that they ieſted, demaunded
how many miles it was to the Citie of Bergamaſke: to
whome the Clownes anſwered, decem, vel circa.
            
            The Florentines hearing this aunſwere; vnto them. O
brethren, wée ſpeake vnto you, in your mother tongue, and
from whence comes it, that you aunſwere vs in latine?
They of Bergamaſke replyed: Ne miremini, excellentiſſimi
Domini, vnuſquiſque enim noſtrûm, ſic vt auditis loquitur,
quoniam Maiores &amp; ſapientes noſtri ſic nos docuerunt.
            
            Riding on their iourney a good diſtaunce off, they ſaw other
clownes, which in the broad wayes clenſed diches: and
ſtaying, ſayde vnto them. Hoe companions, God ſpéede you:
to whome they aunſwered: Et Deus vobiſcum ſemper ſit.
How farre is it to Bergamaſke? ſaide the Florentines. The
other aunſwered, Exigua vobis reſtat via. And entring from
one worde to another, they beganne at length to reaſon in
Philoſophy, and theſe clownes of Bergamaſke framed their
arguments ſo ſtrongly and profoundly, that the Florentine
Doctors were ſcarſe able to aunſwere them. At which all of
them wondring, ſaide amongſt themſelues: How is it poſſible,
that theſe clowniſh men, brought vp in digging of the
ground, and other ruſticall exerciſes, ſhould bée ſo well inſtructed
in humane ſciences? Departing from them, they
road towardes an inne, not farre diſtant from the Citie,
which was fayre and large. As they came ſomewhat néere
it, an Oſtler came forth to inuite them, ſaying: Domini,
libèt ne vobis hoſpitari? Hîc enim vobis erit bonum hoſpitium.
               
And for that the Florentines were very weary, they
alighted, and meant to ryde no farther that night. As they
were mounting vp the ſtayres to goe to their lodging, the
goodman of the Inne met them, ſaying: Excellentiſsimi Domini,
placétne vobis, vt praeparetur coena? híc enim ſunt
bona vina, oua recentia, carnes, volatilia, &amp; alia huiuſmodi.
Heereat the Florentines were amaſed, and knew not
what to ſay: for that all they, with whome they had ſpéech,
ſpake latine, and pronounced no otherwiſe, then if they had
béene brought vp in ſtudie all the dayes of their lyfe. Shortly
after a maide ſeruaunt, indéed
                  •
                came vnto them, which was
a young woman, both wittie and learned, and craftily
brought thither for the purpoſe, which ſayde. Indigéntne
dominationes veſtrae re aliqua? placét vt ſternentur lectuli, vt
requiem capiatis? Theſe wordes of the Maiden brought
greater aſtoniſhment to the Florentines, who began to reaſon
with her, who hauing anſwered to many thinges excéedingly
well, (and all in latine) they queſtioned with her of
diuinitie, of which ſhée did argue ſo catholiquely, that there
was not any y• heard her, but gaue her ſingular commendation.
Whiles the Maiden talked with them, there came one
in, arayde like a baker, his face blackt with coales: who hearing
the diſputation that they had with the Maiden, began
to argue in her defence, and interpreted the holy ſcriptures
ſo learnedly, that al the Florentine doctors affirmed amōgſt
themſelues, that they had ſeldome or neuer heard his better.
This d
                  •
               ſputation being finiſht, the Florentine Doctors wēt
to ſupper, and ſo to their reſt. And the next day approching,
they tooke counſell amongſt themſelues, whether it were
better to goe forwards, or returne home againe. After great
contention had about this matter, they reſolued, that it was
better to departe, thinking thus with themſelues, that if the
Inkéepers, labourers, hoſtlers, &amp; women had ſuch profound
learning: what was to bée looked for in the Citie, where are
moſt excellent men, which continually followe nothing els
but their bookes and ſtudie.
            
               
This determination being well conſidered of, without any
longer tariaunce, they put it in practiſe. And not as much as
ſéeing the walles of the Citie of Bergamaſke, taking their
horſes, tooke their iourney backe againe towardes Florence.
And in this maner, the Florentines were by pollicie conquered
of thē of Bergamaſke. And from thēce forwards the Citizens
of Bergamaſke had a priuiledge from the Emperour, to
paſſe ſafely through all the partes of the world, without th
                  •
               
let or diſturbance of any man.
         
         
            Of one that hyred a fooliſh ſeruaunt,
and was ſerued accordingly.
            
               
                  PAndolfus a Gentleman of Padua, on a
time ſtanding greatly in néede of a ſer
                  ••
               iant,
chaunced to méete with one, wh
                  •
                he
thought would well ſerue his turne: of
whom hée demaunded, whether he would
ſerue him for reſonable wages, who made
aunſwere that hée would: but with this
condition, that hée would at no time doe him any other ſeruice,
but looke to his horſes, and ride with him. Héereon they
concluded, and there were Indentures of couenants drawn,
ſealed, and deliuered for the performance of the premiſſes. It
happened on a certaine day that Pandolfus, as hée rode with
his new ſeruant, in a filthy mirie way, his horſe ſtumbling,
fell into a ditch, and Padolfus vnder him: who being in great
feare and daunger, cryed vnto his man for helpe. His ſeruaunt
ſtanding ſtill, gaue him the looking on, ſaying that he
                  •
               
was not bound to doe it, and that there was no ſuch thing
contained in his Indenture of couenaunt, and taking the
copie thereof out of his pocket, beganne from poynt to point
to reade the conditions of it, to ſée whether it were therein

contained, or no, that hée ſhould helpe him in ſuch a i
                  •
               operdie.
His maiſter cryed out vnto him, ſaying, For the paſſion
of God helpe mée. Hée anſwered, I cannot ſir: for that
it is agaynſt the couenantes of my Indenture. His maiſter
tolde him, that if hée would not helpe him, and deliuer him
out of this daunger, hée woulde not pay him ſuch wages, as
was therein contained hée ſhould haue. The fooliſhe ſeruaunt
ſayde that hée would not doe it, for feare of incurring
the penaltie contained in the Indenture of couenaunt. And
if his maiſter had not béene preſently holpen by one that
came that way, doubtleſſe hée could neuer haue eſcaped.
            For this cauſe, after their returne home, there were new couenantes
drawne, vnto which hée yeelded his conſent, vnder
a certaine forfeiture, to performe and obſerue them truely:
which was, that hée ſhould aſſiſt his maiſter at all times;
in all cauſes that hée commaunded him, and ſhoulde neuer
departe or ſeperate himſelfe from him.
            It chaunced on a time, that Pandolfus entring into one
of the chiefeſt Churches of the Citie, with certaine Venetian
Gentlemen, his ſeruaunt alwayes folowed him at his ſhoulders,
and would neuer leaue him.
            The Gentlemen and other that were by, for the rarenes
of the ſight, tooke vp a great laughter, through which the
maiſter returning to his houſe, chidde him bitterly, ſhewing
him what a fooliſh and vnaduiſed part hée plaied, in walking
ſo childiſhly with him, in the Church, without any reſpect,
either of him, or the Gentlemen that were with him.
            The ſeruaunt alledged vnto him, that hée had not done contrary
to the couenantes that were drawne betwixt them,
and had fulfilled the contents therof and no more. Vpon this
there was a new couenant put in, that hée ſhould goe farther
of from him.
            After that time the ſeruant would kéepe himſelfe aloofe,
and not come néere him by fortie foote, at the leaſt. And
although his maiſter called him, and had néede to vſe him:

Neuertheleſſe, his ſeruaunt would not for feare of incurring
the penaltie contained in the Indentures. Heereat
Pandolphus fretting a good at the folly, and ſimplicity of his
man; told him that his comming farther of him, was to bée
vnderſtoode about a thrée foote diſtant The ſeruant thinking
himſelfe now too be apparauntly aduertiſed of his maiſters
meaning, tooke a ſtaffe of the length of thrée foote, and as hée
went in the citie, would ſet one end therof againſt his breſt,
and holding the other towardes his maiſters ſhoulders, ſo
followed him. The Citizens, &amp; Prentiſes, ſeyng him to goe
in this order, déeming him to bee ſome notable foole, did
laugh at him vnmeaſurably. The maiſter as yet not knowing
wherfore they ſo laught, maruelled greatly, but being afterwards
aduertiſed how he carried the ſtaffe after him, he
was in a great rage, reprehending his ſeruant vehemently,
threatning alſo to beat him. And he weeping and lamenting,
excuſed himſelfe, ſaying, yée doe me manifeſt iniury, Maiſter,
in going about to beate me; made I not a bargaine with you?
haue I not obſerued all the couenants? When did I any
thing contrary to that you willed me? reade the Indenture,
and then puniſh me if I haue fayled in any thing. And thus
his maiſter could neuer iuſtly take him at any aduauntage.
At another time his maiſter ſent him to the Market, to buy
meate, and ſpeaking figuratiuely vnto him; ſaide; Goe thy
way, and let it be a yéere ere yée come agayne: meaning that
he ſhould make ſpéed. The ſeruant ouer obedient to his maiſter,
went into his Country and there tarried till the yéere
was expired; and within one day after came home: &amp; brought
the meate with him to his maiſter, who maruelling thereat
greatly; hauing forgotten what he gaue him in commandement
to doe, rebuked him as a Runaway; ſaying: yée are
come ſomewhat too late, that the gallowes take you. But I
wil reward thée according to thy deſertes knaue and varlet,
that thou art; and thou ſhalt bée ſure to pay the penalty that
thou haſt forfeyted, and getteſt not one peny of wages of me.
            
               
The ſeruaunt anſwered that he had not ſwarued from any
one couenant contained in his Indenture: but had obſerued
them all, and had obeyed him in euery thing that hée
commaunded.
            Call yée to minde maiſter (ſaid hée) that whiles yée willed
mée to tary a yeere, ere I came againe: I haue done ſo:
and therfore pay mée my wages that yée promiſed mee. And
héere vpon they waged the lawe, and in concluſion the mayſter
was conſtrained to pay him his wages, whether hée
would, or no.
            
               THere dwelt in the Citie of Ferrara, an excéeding
rich man, and of a worſhipfull
houſe, who had a ſeruaunt called Fortunius,
a young man of no great witte. It
chaunced that his maiſter on a time ſitting
aſléepe in his orchard, in the extreme
heat of the ſunne, Fortunius hauing a buſh
of fethers, kept of ye flyes from his maiſter, ye hée might take
his reſt the more quietly. Amongſt the other flyes, there
was one ſo importunate, that not waying the buſh of fethers,
wherewith ſhée was ſtriken, often, with her ſharpe
ſting would neuer lin byting the balde pate of his maiſter,
and hauing béene thrée or foure times to anoye him, would
ſtill prf
                  •
               er to come againe.
            In fine Fortunius noting the malapert preſumption of
the beaſt, not being able any longer to forbeare her, very
vnaduiſedly determined to kill her. And the flye ſitting on
the balde pate of his maiſter ſucking out his blood Fortunius
like a ſimple and ignoraunt ſette, tooke a weightie peſtle
of braſſe that by chaunce lay ſome what too néere him; and
lifting it vp with great force with intēt to kil the fly, knockt
out the braines of his maiſter. He ſéeing his maiſter to bée

                  ••
               aine in déede, and thinking that hée ſhould bée hangd for it,
determined to runne away, and ſaue himſelfe by flight:

But altering this his purpoſe, hée thought it better to burie
him in ſome ſecrete place, and putting him into a ſacke, did
ſo. And then taking a great hée Goat of his maiſters, flong
him into a well, that ſtoode néere the Orchard where he ſlept.
The goodman not comming in at night, as hée was accuſtomed,
began to thinke euill of the ſeruaunt, and demanding
of him for her huſband, hée made anſwere, that hée ſaw him
not.
            Then the good wife being very ſorowfull, beganne to
wéepe bitterly, and with a ſkriking voyce, called her huſband,
but all in vaine. Her parents and kinſfolkes ſéeing
that the good man could not bée found, went to the Mayor of
the Citie, and there accuſed Fortunius the feruaunt, ſaying,
that hée ſhould bée committed to priſon, and ſo to be had on
the racke, there to bée made to confeſſe, what was become of
his maiſter.
            The Mayor preſently cauſed him to bée taken, and bound,
and vpon preſumptions committed him to the racke. The
ſeruaunt not being able to abyde the torment thereof, promiſed
to manifeſt the whole: ſo that hée myght bée let downe,
and being taken downe, and had before the Mayor, with a
craftie diſceate, hée ſayde, as foloweth.
            Yeſterday, as I was aſléepe in the orcharde, and ſodenly
a great noyſe awaked mée, which ſéemed, as though ſome
great ſtone had falne into the well. I being aſtouied thereat,
ranne ſodeinly thither, and looking into the water, ſaw
it quiet and ſtill, ſo that I ſought no farther: whiles I returned,
I heard an other lyke noyſe, &amp; I ſtayde. And I verily
thinke it was my maiſter, who being about to draw ſome
water, fell into the well. But for that the troath may bée
knowne of the matter, let vs al go thither, and I wil diſcend
into the well to ſée whether that it bée true or no, which I
gather by preſumptions.
            The Mayor deſirors to make proof of the troth hereof, called

all his brethren with him, and with diuers other Gentlemen
came to the well. And with them went a great company of
the common ſort of people, both men and women, being deſirous
to ſée the iſſue of this matter. And behold as the wicked
fellow by the cōmandement of the Maior deſcended into the
well, &amp; ſought for his maiſter in the water, he found the goate
which he had before throwne therinto, and ther with cried out
to his miſtreſſe, (which was amongeſt the reſt of the company)
ſaying, hoe, miſtres; tel me, had your huſband any hornes?
I haue found one here in this well, which hath a payre both
greate and long, was hee euer your huſband? ſhe being ſurpriſed
with theſe ſpéeches, ſaid neuer a words. The Maior
with all the reſt of the company ſtoode ſtill, beeyng very deſirous
to ſée the dead body, which being drawen vp, when they
perceaued that it was a Goate, they made ſuch excéeding ioy,
that they were like to breake inſunder with laughter. And
the Maior ſeing the chance, adiudged the ſeruant to be truſty,
and releaſed him as innocent, and it was neuer known what
became of his maiſter; and the good wife with the ſcorne of the
horne, remayned defamed euer after.
         
         
            
            
            ¶To the Worſhipfull John Stafford of
Bletherwicke Eſquier, Humfrey Gifford moſt
humbly ſendeth greeting.
            
               ACknowledging my ſelfe deepely
indebted to your woorſhippe for
your profeſſed curteſies, &amp; good
opinion conceaued of me, &amp; deſiring
by ſome one meanes or other
to make manifeſt my thankfull
minde, I haue aduentured the
dedication of this trifling toy, vnto
your protection, notdoubting
of your fauourable acceptance, in
that I beſtow it as an earneſt pennie of my wel meaning, and
teſtimonie of the vnfaigned goodwil that I beare you. The
thing that I here preſent you with, is a poſie of Gillowflowers
collected out of the garden of mine owne inuentions. Which
if they ſhal come too ſhort in ſhew and colour, or proue inferiour
in ſent and odour to that which is to be looked for of
ſo fragrant a flower, let the Gardiner (I pray you) be excuſed,
who hath done his goodwill and indeuour in the ſowing, &amp;
ſetting of them, and lay the fault in the barrenneſſe of the
ſoyle, wherein they were planted: which had it byn better,
their vertue would haue proued to be greater. Though al the
flowers herein contayned, carie one name, yet eche of thé
differs from other, both in colour and ſauour, the better
to ſatiſfie the diuerſitie of eyes that ſhall view them, and variety
of noſes that ſhall ſmell them. Nowe if the ſpider ſhall
happen to ſucke any poyſon out of them, let not the flowers
be the worſe thought of, but conſider that it is his propertie
to doe the like, out of the moſt pure and delectable flowers,
that euer were. And God in geuing vnto her and other ſuch
like creatures this nature, doeth no leſſe manifeſt his omnipotent

power herein, then in his other wonderful works. For
reaſon telleth, &amp; experience teacheth, that in this vale of miſery,
there is nothing ſo beautifull, but that it hath ſome blemiſh;
nor ſo pure, but that it ſauours of ſome imperfection:
ſo that as long as the world is a world, corruption muſt continue
amongſt vs. Which filthy dregs &amp; poyſoned humors, if
they were not in parte drawen &amp; drayned away by the venomous
beaſtes and wormes of the earth, they woulde a
great deale more annoy vs, then now they doe. And it is to
be doubted whether life could any long time be conſerued a
mogſt vs. I might here take occaſion to liken the crew of curious
carpers (which more of malice then good meaning accuſtomed
to cauel at other mens doings, playing the ydle
drones themſelues) to the venomous beaſtes &amp; wormes before
ſpoken of: Whom for their congruity in condition, and
affinity in diſpoſition I might bring them within the compas
of one cōpariſon, &amp; conclude that both the one &amp; the other
are neceſſary euils. But leſte that the old prouerb be obiected
agaynſt me, Ne ſutor vltra crepitam, let the Gardiner meddle
no farther thē his ſpade, I wil leaue thē to theyr predeceſſor
Zoilus (whoſe apes they are in imitating his conditions) &amp; returne
agayne to my Gillowflowers, eft foones beſeeching your
worſhip to accept thoſe that I preſent you with no leſſe thākfulnes
then the Gardiner doth offer them willingly, wherof
he doubtes not, calling to minde your accuſtomed curteſie.
In one thing I haue vſed ſuche circumſpection as my ſimple
ſkill, would permit me, which is that the beauty of my flowers
be not blemiſhed with the weedes of wantonneſſe, that
cōmonly grow in ſuch gardens. I hope therfore, ye ſhal finde
them rooted out in ſuch ſort, that if there remayne any, my
truſt is they ſhall not fall out, to be many. The onely thing
that I doubt of this in my dedication, is that your worſhipp
ſhall haue cauſe to account mee a deepe diſſembler and one
that hath byn more lauiſh in promiſe, then he is able to pay
with performance. For whereas by my former ſpeeches, yee
might peraduenture looke for ſome delicate Gillowflowers,
               
it will fall out to be but a coppy of my countenance, hauing
done nothing els, but (as the faſhion of the worlde is now adayes)
ſet a good face on a bad matter. For (to deale plainly
with you) I was neuer Gardiner in all my life. And the thing
that I here preſent you with, is but a collection of ſuch verſes
and odde deuiſes as haue (at ſuch idle howres as I founde in
my maiſter his ſeruice) vpon ſundry occaſions by me byn cō
               poſed.
The one I confeſſe farre vnworthy your view, and yet
ſuch as when ye ſhal returne home weeried from your fielde
ſportes, may yeelde you ſome recreation. The chiefe marke
that I leuel at is, the continuance of your woorſhips curteſie
and good minde towardes me, which as they haue already
ſurmounted the reach of my deſerts, ſo if I might enioy the
fruition of them hereafter, in that fulneſſe which I hope for,
I ſhall account all the duetifull endeuour that I can poſſibly
ſhew you inſufficient, for the ſatisfaction of the leaſt part of
them. Thus for feare of being tedious, I ende, wiſhing your
worſhip, with my good miſtres your wife &amp; all yours many
yeeres of proſperitie, with dayly increaſe of worſhip, &amp; heauen
for your hauen to reſt in, when the daungerous ſea of
this life ſhalbe ouer ſailed.

            The life of man metaphorically compared
to a ſhippe, ſayling on the ſeaes in
a tempeſt.
            
               HAſte homewardes, man, draw néerer to the ſhore,

               The raged rockes, with rumbling noyſe doe rore,

               Ech thing foreſhewes a tempeſt is at hand,

               In worldly ſeaes thy ſilly ſhip is toſt:
               With waues of woe beſette on euery ſide,
               Blowne héere, and there, in daunger to bée loſt:

               Cut downe the maſt of rancour and debate,
               Vnfraight the ſhippe of all vnlawfull wares:
               Caſt ouer boorde the packes of hoorded hate,
               Pumpe out fowle vice, the cauſe of many cares.
               If that ſome léeke, it make thée ſtand in doubt,
               Repentaunce ſerues, to ſtoppe the water out.

               Fell Sathan is chiefe rular of theſe ſeas:
               Hée ſéekes our wracke, hée doth theſe tempeſtes rayſe.
            
            
               In what wée may let vs alwayes repreſſe,

               Let him and I together goe:

               Perhappes hée wil, to win the beſt,
               paint forth what pangs oppreſſe his minde,
               How that hée féeles no quiet reſt:
               how fortune is to him vnkind:
               And how hée pines in ſecréet griefe,
               and findes no meanes for his reliefe.
            
            
               Theſe and ſuch like a number will,
               alleadge to witnes their diſtreſſe,

               and ſome with Yxion doe compare.
            
            
               But I not onely féele the ſmart,
               of al thoſe euilles rehearſed before:
               But taſt the forment in my heart,
               of thouſand times as many more:
               
               So that the worſt of their annoyes,
               Is beſt and chiefeſt of my ioyes.
            
            
               I neuer fed on coſtly meate,
               Since that this griefe oppreſt mée firſt:
               Dole is the dainties that I eate,
               And trickling teares doe coole my thirſt:
               Care is my caruing knife, God wot,
               Which dayly ſéekes to cut my throte.
            
            
               Muſe not that héere I ſecret kéepe
               The cauſe that firſt procurde my griefe:
               What doeth it boote a man to wéepe,
               When that his teares finde no reliefe?
               Contentes mée onely, this repoſe,
               That death ere long will end my woes.
            
         
         
            In praiſe of the contented
minde.
            
               IF all the ioyes that worldly wightes poſſeſſe,
               Were throughly ſcand, and pondred in their kindes,
               No man of wit, but iuſtly muſt confeſſe,
               That they ioy moſt, that haue contented mindes.
               And other ioyes, which beare the name of ioyes,
               Are not right ioyes, but ſunneſhines of anoyes.
            
            
               In outward view wée ſée a number glad,
               Which make a ſhew, as if mirth did abound:
               Whē pinching grief within doth make them ſad.
               And many a one in theſe dayes may bée had,
               Which faintly ſmile to ſhroud their ſorowes ſo,
               When oftentimes they pine in ſecréet woe.
            
            
               
               But euery man that holdes himſelfe content,
               And yéeldes God thankes, as dutie doth require:
               For all his giftes that hée to vs hath ſent,
               And is not vext with ouer great deſire:
               And ſuch, I ſay, moſt quietly doe ſléepe,
               When fretting cares doth others waking kéepe.
            
            
               What doth auaile huge heapes of ſhining golde,
               Or gay attyre, or ſtately buildinges braue:
               If worldly pelfe thy heart in bondage holde?
               Not thou thy goodes, thy goodes make thée their ſlaue.
               For gréedie men like Tantalus doe fare,
               In midſt of wealth, they néedie are and bare.
            
            
               A warie héede that thinges go not to loſſe,
               Doth not amiſſe, ſo that it kéepe the meane:
               But ſtill to toyle and moyle for worldly droſſe,
               And taſt no ioy nor pleaſure for our paine:
               In carke and care both day and night to dwell,
               Is nothing els but euen a very hell.
            
            
               Wherefore I ſay, as erſt I did beginne,
               Contented men enioy the greaetſt bliſſe:
               Let vs content our ſelues to flye from ſinne,
               And ſtill abide what Gods good pleaſure is.
               If ioy, or paine, if wealth, or want befall,
               Let vs bée pleaſde, and giue God thankes for all.
            
         
         
            
            In the praiſe of Friendſhip.
            
               REueale (O tongue) the ſecretes of my thought,
               Tel forth the game that perfect friendſhip brings:
               Expreſſe what ioyes by her to man are brought,
               
                  Ʋnfolde her prayſe which glads all earthly things:
               If one might ſay, in earth a heauen to bée,
               It is no doubt, where faythfull friendes agrée.
            
            
               To all eſtates true friendſhip is a ſtay,
               To euery wight a good and welcome gueſt:
               Our life were death, were ſhée once tane away,
               Conſuming cares would harbour in our breſt.
               Fowle malice eke, would baniſh al delight,
               And puffe vs vp with poyſon of deſpight.
            
            
               If that the ſéedes of enuie and debate;
               Might yéelde no fruite, but wither and decay;
               No canckred mindes would hoorde vp heapes of hate.
               No hollow hearts diſſembling partes ſhould play.
               No clawback then would fawne in hope of méede,
               Such life to lead, were perfect life in déede.
            
            
               But nowadayes deſire of worldly pelfe,
               With all eſtates makes friendſhip very colde:
               Few for their friendes, ech ſhifteth for himſelfe,
               If in thy purſe thou haſt good ſtore of golde:
               Full many a one, thy friendſhip will imbrace,
               Thy wealth once ſpent, they turne away their face.
            
            
               Let vs ſtill pray vnto the Lord aboue,
               For to relent our hearts as hard as ſtone:
               That through the world one knot of loyall loue,
               In perfect trueth might linke vs all in one:
               
               Then ſhould wée paſſe this life without annoyes,
               And after death poſſeſſe eternall ioyes.
            
         
         
            A commendation of
Peace.
            
               WHen boyling wrath perturbs mās troubled breſt,
               Outraging will bids reaſons lore adue:
               Turmoyling cares bereaue all quiet reſt,
               And haſtie yre makes harmefull happes enſue,
               Great ſtormes of ſtrife are raiſd, through dire debate,
               But golden peace preſerues the quiet ſtate.
            
            
               A gift diuine, than precious pearle more worth,
               Is bleſſed peace, to diſcord deadly foe.
               Moſt plenteous fruits this blooming trée brings forth
               When warre and ſtrife yéeld crops of care and woe.
               Raſh rancours rage procures fond furious fightes,
               Peace makes men ſwim in feaes of ſwéet delights.
            
            
               If that this peace bée ſuch a paſſing thing,
               That it by right may challenge worthy prayſe:
               What thankes owe wée vnto our heauenly king,
               Through whome we haue enioyde ſuch happy dayes?
               Next to our Quéene, how déepely are wée bound,
               Whoſe like on earth, before was neuer found?
            
            
               If England would perpend the bloody broyles,
               And ſlaughters huge that foraine realmes haue tried,
               It ſhould me ſéemes, by warnd by their turmoyles,
               In perfect loue and concord to abide.
               But (out alas) my heart doeth rue to tell)
               Small feare of God, amongſt vs now doth dwell.
            
            
               
               And where that wantes, what hope doth els remayne,
               But dire reuenge for raſh committed crimes?
               Heapes of miſhaps will fall on vs amayne,
               If we doe not lament our ſinnes betimes.
               Vnleſſe with ſpéede, to God for grace we call,
               I feare, I feare, great plagues on vs will fall.
            
            
               England therefore, in time conuert from vice,
               The pleaſant ſpring abides not all the yeere.
               Let foraine ylls, forewarne thée to be wiſe,
               Stormes may enſue, though now the coaſtes be cléere.
               I ſay no more, but onely doe requeſt,
               That God will turne all things vnto the beſt.
            
         
         
            For Souldiers.
            
               Ye buds of Brutus land, couragious youths, now play your parts
               Vnto your tackle ſtand, abide the brunt with valiāt hearts.
               For newes is carried too &amp; fro, that we muſt forth to warfare goe:
               Men muſter now in euery place, &amp; ſouldiers are preſt forth apace.
               Faynt not, ſpend blood; to doe your Quéene &amp; countrey good.
               Fayre wordes, good pay, wil make men caſt al care away.
            
            
               The time of warre is come, prepare your corſlet, ſpeare &amp; ſhield,
               Me thinks I heare the drumme, ſtrike doleful marches to the field,
               Tantara, tātara, y• trūpets ſound, wt makes our harts wt ioy aboūd,
               The roring guns are heard a far, &amp; euery thing denounceth warre.
               Serue God, ſtand ſtoute; bold courage brings this geare about.
               Feare not; forth run; faint heart, faire Lady neuer woonne.
            
            
               Yée curious Carpet knights, that ſpende the time in ſport &amp; play
               Abrode &amp; ſée new ſights, your coūtries cauſe cals you away:
               Doe not to make your Ladies game, bring blemiſh to your worthy name.
               Away to field, &amp; win renoune, wc courage beat your enimies down.
               Stoute hearts gain praiſe, when Daſtards ſayle in ſlaunders ſeas:
               Hap what hap ſhal, we ſure, ſhal die but once for all,
            
            
               
               Alarme me thinkes they cry, be packing mates, be gone with ſpéed,
               Our foes are very nigh, ſhame haue that man that ſhrinks at néed.
               Vnto it boldly let vs ſtand, God wil geue right the vpper hand.
               Our cauſe is good, we néed not doubt, in ſigne of courage geue a ſhowte.
               March forth, be ſtrōg, good hap wil come ere it be long.
               Shrinke not, fight well, for luſty lads muſt beare the bell.
            
            
               All you that wil ſhun euil, muſt dwel in warfare euery day,
               The world, the fleſh &amp; Diuel, alwayes doe ſéeke our ſoules decay.
               ſtriue wt theſe foes wt al your might, ſo ſhal you fight a worthy fight.
               That cōqueſt doth deſerue moſt praiſe, wher vice do yéeld to vertues wayes.
               Beat down foule ſin, a worthy crown then ſhal ye win.
               If we liue wel, in heauen with Chriſt our ſoules ſhal dwell.
            
         
         
            To his friende.
            
               MUſe not too much (o wight of worthy fame)
               At view of this my rude &amp; ragged rime,
               I am almoſt enforſt to write the ſame:
               Wherefore forgeue, if I commit a crime.
               The cauſe hereof, and how it came to paſſe,
               I ſhall declare, euen briefly as it was.
            
            
               Reuoluing in my mind your friendly face,
               Your bountie great, your loue to euery man,
               I heard my wit, and will to ſcan this caſe,
               If I ſhould write or no, thus wil began.
               Take pen in hand thou fearefull wight ſhe ſaid,
               To write thy mind what ſhould make thée afraid?
            
            
               Not ſo (quoth wit) acquaintance hath he ſmall,
               With him to whō thou bidſt him write his mind,
               What tho (quoth will) that ſkils nothing at all,
               He writes to one that is to all a friend.
               
               Him ſo to be (quoth wit) none can denie.
               Thou art a foole (quoth will) then to reply.
            
            
               Great cauſe (quoth wit) ſhoulde make him to refraine.
               He would (quoth wil) declare his friendly heart.
               What if (quoth wit) he chance to reape diſdayne?
               Of ſuch foul fruits (quoth wil) friēds haue no part.
               Perchance (quoth wit) it wilbe taken yll.
               Wel meaned things, who wil take yl (quoth wil?)
            
            
               He hath no ſkil (quoth wit,) how ſhould he write?
               Al want of ſkil (quoth will) good will ſupplies.
               I ſée (quoth wit) thou wilt worke him deſpite.
               For counſell good thou, geueſt him raſh aduice.
               Wit ſaid no more: But will that ſtately Dame,
               Still bad me write, not forcing any blame.
            
            
               Since will, not wit, makes me commit offence,
               Of pardon yours the better hope I haue.
               To ſhew my loue was all the whole pretence,
               That made me write. This onely doe I craue:
               In any thing if pleaſure you I can,
               Command me ſo, as if I were your man.
            
         
         
            A renouncing of loue.
            
               AL earthly things by courſe of kind,
               Are ſubiect ſtill to reaſons lore:
               But ſure I can no reaſons finde,
               That makes theſe Louers loue ſo ſore.
               They fry and fréeſe in myldeſt weather,
               They wéepe and laugh euen both together.
            
            
               Euen now in waues of déepe deſpaire,
               Their barke is toſſed too and fro.
               
               A gale of hope expels al feare,
               And makes the winde to ouerblow:
               Twixt feare and hope theſe Louers ſaile,
               And doubtful are which ſhall preuayle.
            
            
               At night in ſlumber ſwéetly laide,
               They ſéeme to holde their loue in armes:
               Awaking then, they are afrayde,
               And féele the force of thouſand harmes.
               Then doe they toſſe in reſtleſſe bed,
               With hammers woorking in their head.
            
            
               A merry looke from Ladies face,
               Bringes them a foote which could not goe:
               A frowning brow doth them diſgrace,
               And brues the broth of all their woe,
               Hereby all men may playnely know:
               That reaſon rules not Louers law.
            
            
               But reaſon doth me thus perſuade,
               Where reaſon wants, that nothing frames:
               Therefore this reaſon hath me made,
               To ſet aſide all louely gaynes.
               Since reaſon rules not Venus ſport,
               No reaſon bids me ſcale that forte.
            
         
         
            A will or Teſtament.
            
               VVHen dreadfull death with dint of pearcing darte,
               By fatall doome, this corpes of mine ſhal kill;
               When lingring life ſhall from my life depart,
               I thus ſet downe, my teſtament and will.
               My faythfull friendes executor
                     •
                   ſhall remayne,
               To ſée performde what here I doe or dayne.
            
            
               
               To thée (O world) I firſt of all doe leaue
               The vayne delights, that I in thée haue found,
               Thy fained ſhewes wherewith thou didſt deceaue,
               Thy fickle truſt, and promiſes vnſound.
               My wealth, my woe, my ioyes commixt wt care.
               Doe take them, all doe fall vnto thy ſhare.
            
            
               And Satan thou, for that thou wert the cauſe,
               That I in ſinne did ſtill miſpend my dayes,
               I thée defie, and here renounce thy lawes,
               My wicked thoughts, my vile and naughty waies,
               And eke my vice doe to thy lot befall,
               From thée they came, doe take them to thee all.
            
            
               To thée, O earth, agayne I do reſtore,
               My carrion corpes, which from thée did procéede:
               Becauſe it did neglect all godly lore,
               Let gréedy wormes vpon it alwayes féede;
               Let it in filth conſume and rot away,
               And ſo remaine vntil the iudgement day.
            
            
               But my poore ſoule, whō Chriſt moſt déerly bought
               Which hated ſinne, and loathed to offend,
               Together with ech good and godly thought,
               Into thy handes, ſwéete Ieſu, I commend.
               O ſauiour Chriſt, doe guide my ſteppes ſo well,
               That after death, ſhe ſtil with thée may dwell.
            
         
         
            A Complaynt of a Louer.
            
               IF euer wofull wight had cauſe, to pipe in bitter ſmart,
               I which am thrall to Cupids lawes, with him may beare a part.
               Whoſe ioyful dayes alas, are gone; whom daily cares doe toſſe,
               But wote yée why I thus take on? my lucke is turnde to loſſe.
               
               Erecruell loue my heart poſſeſt, no cares did vexe my head,
               But ſince he harboured in my breſt, my golden dayes are fled.
               Time was when fortune did allow, great gladneſſe to my ſhare,
               But ah, for that time is not, now doth grow my cauſe of care.
               Time was when I liude in delight, and reapt of ioyes my fill:
               But now time is, workes me deſpite, would waſte had tarried ſtill.
               No hap ſo hard, no griefe ſo great, whereof I féele not part,
               Now ſhiuering colde, now flaming heate, anoyes my wofull heart.
               So that hope is the onely ſtay, on which my life dependes,
               Which if it once be tane away, my date of liuing ends.
               God graunt my hope, ſuch hap may ſée, that good ſucceſſe enſue,
               Which if it long prolonged be, through griefe I die, adiew.
            
         
         
            For his friende.
            
               
                  I That in fréedome liued of late,
               And neuer ſtoupt to Cupids lure,
               Haue now made change of my eſtate,
               And thouſand torments doe endure.
               As late abrode I caſt my lookes,
               In fancies lune I faſt was cought,
               And beauty with her bayted hookes,
               Hath me alas in bondage brought.
               I loue, but lacke the thing I craue,
               I liue, but want my chiefeſt good,
               I hope, but hap I cannot haue,
               I ſerue, but ſtarue for want of foode.
               Then ſo to loue, what ſtate more yll?
               Such life affoordes ſmall time of ioy,
               Such wauering hope doth often kill,
               To ſerue and ſtarue what worſe anoy?
               Yet wil I loue whiles life doth laſt,
               And liue whiles any hope remaines,
               And hope when diſmal dayes are paſt,
               To haue reward for all my paynes.
            
            
               
               Loe thus I liue by hope ſuſtaynd,
               Yet through diſpayre, die euery houre,
               In ſorow glad, in pleaſure painde,
               Now fed with ſwéete, now choakt with ſowre.
               Deare Dame in humble ſort I ſew,
               Since mine eſtate to you is known,
               Voutſafe my dolefull caſe to rew,
               And ſaue his life who is your owne.
            
         
         
            Somewhat made of nothing, at a
Gentlewomans requeſt
            
               YE gladly would haue me to make you ſome toy,
               And yet will not tel me wherof I ſhould write:
               The ſtrangenes of this doth bréed me anoy,
               And makes me to ſéeke what things to endite.
               If I ſhould write raſhly what comes in my braine,
               It might be ſuch matter as likes you not beſt,
               And rather I would great ſorow ſuſtayne,
               Then not to fulfill your lawfull requeſt.
               Two dangers moſt doubtful oppreſſe me alike,
               Ne am I reſolued to which I might yéelde,
               Wherfore by perforce I am foretd to ſéeke,
               This ſlender deuice to ſerue for my ſhield.
               Since nothing yée geue me to buſie my brayne,
               Nothing but your nothing of me can yée craue.
               Wherfore now receiue your nothing agayne,
               Of nothing, but nothing, what els would yée haue.
            
         
         
            Of the inſtability of Fortune.
            
               WHo wiſely waies falſe fortunes fickle change,
               Which in ſhort ſpace turnes loue to mortal hate,
               Shall find ſmal cauſe to déem it wondrous ſtrange,
               To fléete from happie life to worſe eſtate.
               For whie her ſwéete is alwaies mixt with ſowre,
               If now ſhée fawne, ſhe frownes within an houre,
            
            
               
               Her ſmiles are wyles to cauſe men hope for hap,
               Her traynes bréede paynes, though pleaſant be the ſhow,
               Him whom ſhée now doth dandle in her lap,
               Straightway ſuſtaines a wretched ouer throw.
               And whom thou ſéeſt at foote of whéele downe caſt,
               Within ſhort ſpace, ſhée hoyſeth vp as faſt.
            
            
               The raging Seas which dayly ebbes and flowes,
               The wauering winds, which blow now here now there,
               More conſtant are then fortunes flattering vowes,
               Who in one hoode, a double face doth beare.
               To truſt her lookes, when ſhée doth fleere or laugh,
               Is nothing els but truſt a broken ſtaffe.
            
            
               
                  Pollicrates (as auncient writers tell)
               On Fortunes whéele moſt highly was aduaunſte,
               And many a yéere ſhée fauourd him ſo well,
               That no ill hap long time vnto him chaunſt.
               Yet in the end, to ſhew her double wayes,
               With hemping roape, ſhée cauſde him end his dayes.
            
            
               If thou wilt ſhun all ſorow and diſtreſſe,
               By fortunes threates doe ſet but litle ſtore,
               If thine affayres haue euer good ſucceſſe,
               Yéeld hearty thankes to God thy Lorde therefore.
               If great annoyes doe fall vpon thée faſt,
               Thinke them due plagues for ſome offences paſt.
            
            
               By prayer then make leuell with the Lorde.
               Repentant hearts haue mercie when they call:
               Loue him with feare, delight to reade his worde,
               So great good haps vnto thée will befall.
               So ſhalt thou leade thy life without annoyes,
               And after death poſſeſſe eternal ioyes.
            
         
         
            
            Of the vanitie of this life.
            
               
                  I Reade in Poets faigned bookes,
               That wiſe Vlyſſes wandring came,
               Where Circes through her fawning lookes,
               Did worke his men a ſpightfull ſhame.
               She cauſde them quaffe great bowles of wine,
               And preſently they turnde to ſwine.
            
            
               But hée which followed vertue ſtill,
               Refuſde to taſte this proffered charme,
               And would not worke her beaſtly will,
               As one that doubted farther harme.
               Her witchcraftes and enchantmentes ſtraunge,
               Were not of force this man to chaunge.
            
            
               The world with his alluring toyes,
               Is Circes witch of whome they write:
               Which temptes vs with her ſugred ioyes,
               And makes vs ſwimme in ſuch delight,
               That wée ſo play with pleaſures ball,
               As if there were no God at all.
            
            
               If man would way, what enemies
               Are alwayes preſt him to deuoure,
               Mée thinkes from ſinne hée ſhould ariſe,
               And make defence with all his power.
               For why, the world, the fleſh, and deuill,
               Doe neuer ceaſe to worke vs euill.
            
            
               Theſe ſo bewitch our fooliſh braines,
               That nought wée force eternall paine:
               And euery one in ſinne remaines,
               As if hell were a fable vaine.
               Alas wée are ſeduced ſo,
               That all true heartes do bléede for woe.
            
            
               
               The ſhéepe doth yéerely yéelde his fléeſe,
               The plodding Oxe the plow doth draw:
               And euery thing in willing wiſe,
               Kéepes and obayes dame Natures law:
               But man in witte, which ſhould excell,
               Againſt his Lord doth ſtill rebell.
            
            
               Ech doth deferre from day to day,
               And thinkes the morow to amend:
               But death areſtes vs by the way,
               And ſodainly ſome makes their end.
               O wretched caſe that they bée in,
               Which die, and not lament their ſinne.
            
            
               Thou ſilly man, ſtill feare the Lord,
               Thy former ſinnes with ſpéede forſake:
               The iudgement day in minde record,
               In which ech ſoule account muſt make,
               Confeſſe thy faultes to God therefore,
               Repent, amend, and ſinne no more.
            
         
         
            Of the vanitie of the
world.
            
               AS I lay muſing in my bed,
               A heape of fancies came in head,
               Which greatly did moleſt mée.
               Such ſundry thoughtes of ioy and paine,
               Did méete within my pondring braine,
               That nothing could I reſt mée;
               Sometimes I felt excèeding ioy;
               Sometimes the torment of annoy,
               Euen now I laugh, euen now I wéepe,
               Euen now a ſlumber made mee ſléepe.
            
            
               
               Thus did I with thoughtes of ſtraunge deuice,
               Lye muſing alone in penſiue wiſe:
               I knew not what meanes might health procure,
               Nor finiſh the toyle I did indure.
               And ſtill I lay, and found no way,
               That beſt could make my cares decay.
            
            
               Reuoluing theſe thinges in my minde,
               Of wretched world the fancies blinde:
               Alone a while I ponder:
               Which when I had peruſed well,
               And ſaw no vertue there to dwell,
               It made mée greatly wonder.
               Is this that goodly thing (thought I)
               That all men loue ſo earneſtly?
               Is this the fruit that it doth yéelde,
               Whereby wée all are ſo beguilde?
               Ah Ieſus, how then my heart did rue,
               Becauſe I had folowed them, as true.
               Alas wée haue loſt the heauenly ioyes,
               And haue béene deceaued with worldly toyes;
               Whoſe fancies vaine, will bréede vs paine,
               If Chriſt doe not reſtore againe.
            
            
               O wretched man, leaue off therefore,
               In worldly thinges put truſt no more.
               Which yéeldes no thing but ſorow:
               To God thy Lord with ſpéede conuert,
               Becauſe thou moſt vncertain art:
               If thou ſhalt liue too morow,
               Leaue of to quaffe, to daunce and play,
               Remember ſtill the iudgement day,
               Repent, relent, and call for grace,
               For pardon aſke, whilſt thou haſt ſpace.
            
            
               
               Who doeth from his heart repentaunce craue,
               Forgiuenes (ſaieth Chriſt) of mée ſhall haue.
               Hée will not the death of a ſinner giue:
               But rather hée ſhould repent and liue.
               Stil laud the Lord, peruſe his word,
               And let thy déedes with it accord.
            
         
         
            A Leſſon for all eſtates.
            
               HAſt thou deſire thy golden dayes to ſpend,
               In bliſfull ſtate exempt from all annoyes?
               So liue, as if death how thy life ſhould end,
               Still treade the pathes that leade to perfect ioy.
               Bee ſlow to ſinne, but ſpéedie to aſke grace,
               How are they bleſt that thus runne out their race?
            
            
               Ech night, ere ſléepe ſhut vp thy drowſie eyes,
               Thinke thou how much in day thou haſt tranſgreſt;
               And pardon craue of God in any wiſe,
               To doe that's good, and to forſake the reſt.

            A Dreame.
            IN pleaſaunt moneth of gladſome May
            I walkt abroad to view
            The fieldes, which nature had bedeckt
            With flowers of ſundry hew.
            The ſight whereof did recreate
            My ſenſes in ſuch ſort,
            As paſſeth far beyond my power,
            Thereof to make reporte.
            Then ſat I néere a pleaſaunt wood,
            And liſtened with deſire:
            Vnto the ſmall birdes chirping charme,
            Which ſet my heart on fire.
            Of Goldefinch and of Nightingale
            I there might heare the voyce:
            The Wren, the Robin and the thruſh,
            Did make a heauenly noyſe.
            Whoſe ſwéete melodious harmonie
            My ſenſes ſo bere
                  •
               t,
            That I in this delightfull plot,
            A pray to ſléepe was left.
            In ſlumber mine an auncient dame,
            Before my face appeares:
            Whoſe hollow chéekes and wrinckled face,
            Did argue many yéeres.
            Her veſture was as white as ſnow,
            Her countenaunce very ſad,
            It ſemed by her watry eine,
            Some inward griefe ſhée had.
            
            For why, great ſtreames of trickling teares,
            Diſtilled downe her chéekes,
            And thus to mée with trembling voyce,
            This aged beldam ſpeakes.
            My friende (quoth ſhée) bée not diſmayde,
            At this my ſodaine ſight,
            Ne let the ſpéeches I ſhall vſe,
            Thy fearefull minde afright.
            I am not of the furies broode,
            Ne damned ſprites of hell:
            But hée through whome my being is,
            Aboue the ſkies doth dwell.
            And Lady Concord I am calde,
            From forraine Realmes exilde:
            Once mutual Loue my huſband was,
            And plentie was our childe:
            But, ah, quod ſhée, a hagge of hell,
            That long hath ſought their ſpoyle
            Hath ſlaine them both, vnleſſe they dwell,
            Within your engliſh ſoyle.
            Héerewith there yſſued from her eine,
            Of teares abundant ſtore:
            And ſighes ſo ſtopt her féeble voyce,
            That ſhée could ſpeake no more.
            The ſight wherof (mée thought) did rayſe,
            Great dolours in my breaſt:
            Yet praying her for to procéede,
            She thus her minde expreſt.
            Vile Couetouſneſſe that furie fell,
            Hath wrought vs all this woe:
            To Concord and to Mutuall Loue,
            
            Shée is a deadly foe.
            Time was, when wée were well eſtéemde,
            And calde ech countries ſtay:
            But Couetouſneſſe now rules the roaſt,
            And beareth all the ſway.
            
            And were it not that in this land,
            I finde ſome ſmall reliefe:
            I had béene dead long ere this time,
            Through greatneſſe of my gréefe.
            Debate and rancour night and day,
            On this vile Dame attend,
            Whom ſhée to worke her beaſtly will,
            About the world doth ſend.
            Theſe two haue rayſde ſuch warre and ſtrife,
            In partes beyond the Seas,
            That now few nations in the earth,
            Enioy their woonted peace.
            Now gold is reuerenced as a God,
            Eche hunts for priuat gayne.
            Men care not how their ſoules ſhall ſpéede,
            So wealth they may attaine.
            Of conſcience now, few make account,
            Him men eſtéeme moſt wiſe:
            Which to beguile his neighbour poore,
            Can craftieſt meanes deuiſe.
            This ſayd, mée thought the auncient dame,
            Did vaniſh ſtraight away.
            And I awaking héere withall,
            Went home without delay,
            Where taking paper, penne, and inke,
            With ſpéede I there enrolde:
            The circumſtaunce of all the tale,
            That Concord to mée tolde.
            Which makes me wiſh that euery one,
            Would mutuall loue imbrace:
            And that no ſpots of couetouſneſſe,
            With ſinne their déedes deface.
         
         
            A Dreame.
            
               LAyd in my quiet bed to reſt,
               When ſléepe my ſenſes all had drownd;
               
               Such dreames aroſe within my breaſt,
               As did with feare my minde confound.
               Mée thought I wandred in a wood,
               Which was as darke, as pitte of hell:
               In midſt whereof ſuch waters ſtoode,
               That where to paſſe, I could not tell.
               The Lion, Tiger, Woolfe, and Beare,
               There thundered forth ſuch hideous cries:
               As made huge Eccoes in the ayre,
               And ſéemed almoſt to pearce the ſkies.
               Long vext with care I there aboad,
               And to get forth I wanted power:
               At euery footeſteppe that I troad,
               I feard ſome beaſt would mée deuoure.
               Abyding thus perplext with paine,
               This caſe within my ſelfe I ſcand,
               That humaine helpe was all in vaine,
               Vnleſſe the Lord with vs doe ſtand.
               Then falling flatte vpon my face,
               In humble ſorte to God I prayde:
               That in this darke and dreadfull place,
               Hée would vouchſafe to bee mine ayde.
               Ariſing then a wight with winges,
               Of auncient yéeres mée thinkes I ſée:
               A burning torch in hand hée bringes,
               And thus beganne to ſpeake to mée.
               That God, whoſe ayde thou didſt implore,
               Hath ſent mée hither for thy ſake:
               Plucke vp thy ſprites, lament no more,
               With mée thou muſt thy iourney take.
               Againſt a huge and loftie hill,
               With ſwifteſt pace mée thinkes wée goe:
               Where ſuch a ſound mine eares did fill,
               As moued my heart to bléede for woe.
               Mée thought I heard a woefull wight,
               In dolefull ſorte powre forth great plaintes:
               
               Whoſe cries did ſo my minde afright,
               That euen with feare ech member faintes.
               Fie (quoth my guyd) what meanes this change,
               Paſſe on a pace with courage bolde,
               Hereby doth ſtand a priſon ſtrange,
               Where woonderous thinges thou maiſt beholde.
               Then came we to a fort of braſſe,
               Where péering through greate iron grates,
               We ſaw a woman ſit alas,
               Which ruthfully bewaylde her fates.
               Her face was farre more white then ſnow,
               And on her head a crowne ſhée ware,
               Beſet with ſtones that gliſtered ſo,
               As hundred torches had bene there.
               Her ſong was woe, and weale away,
               What torments here doe I ſuſtayne?
               A new miſhap did her diſmay,
               Which more and more increaſt her payne,
               An vggly creature all in blacke,
               Ran to her ſeate, and flang her downe,
               Who rent her garments from her backe,
               And ſpoyld her of her precious crowne.
               This crowne he plaſte vpon his hed,
               And leauing her in dolefull caſe,
               With ſwifteſt pace away he fled:
               And darkneſſe came in all the place.
               But then to heare the wofull moue,
               And piteous grones that ſhe foorth ſent,
               He had no doubt, a heart of ſtone,
               That could geue eare and not lament,
               Then (quoth my guide) note well my talke.
               And thou ſhalt heare this dreame declard:
               The wood in which thou firſt didſt walke,
               Vnto the world may be comparde.
               The roaring beaſts plainly expreſſe,
               The ſundry ſnares in which we fall,
            
            
               
               This Gaole is named déepe diſtreſſe,
               In which Dame vertue lies as thrall,
               Shée is the wight which heere within,
               So dolefully doth houle and crie,
               Her foe is called deadly ſinne,
               That proffered her this villany.
               My name is Time, whom God hath ſent,
               To warne thée of thy ſoules decay,
               In time therefore thy ſinnes lament,
               Leaſt time from thée be tane away.
               As ſoone as he theſe wordes had ſayd,
               With ſwifteſt pace away he flies,
               And I hereat was ſo afrayde,
               That drowſie ſléepe forſooke mine eyes.
            
         
         
            For a Gentlewoman.
            LIke as a forte or fenced towne.
            By foes aſſault that lies in field,
            When Bulwarkes all are beaten downe,
            Is by perforce conſtraynde to yéelde,
            So I that could no while withſtand,
            The battery of your pleaſant loue,
            The flagge of truce tooke in my hande,
            And meant your mercy for to proue.
            My fooliſh fancie did enforce,
            Me firſt to like your friendly ſute,
            Whiles your demaunds bred ſuch remorce,
            That I coulde not the ſame refute.
            I bad you take with frée conſent,
            All that which true pretence might craue,
            And you remaynde as one content,
            The thing obtaynd that you would haue.
            Such friendly lookes and countenance fayre,
            You fréely then to me profeſt.
            
            As if all troth that euer were,
            Had harboured beene within your breſt.
            And I which ſaw ſuch perfect ſhewes,
            Of fraudleſſe fayth in you appeare.
            Did yeelde my ſelfe to Cupids Lawes,
            And ſhewde likewiſe a merrie chéere.
            No louing toyes I did withholde,
            And no ſuſpect did make me doubt.
            Til your demeanure did vnfolde,
            The wilie traines ye went about.
            Who ſees a ruinous houſe to fall,
            And will not ſhift to get him thence.
            When limines be cruſht, and broken all.
            Its then too late to make defence.
            When pleaſant baite is ſwallowed downe.
            The hooked fiſh is ſure to die,
            On theſe Dame Fortune oft doe frowne,
            As truſt too farre before they trie.
            Of had I wiſt, who makes his moane,
            Its ten to one he neuer thriues,
            When théeues are from the Gibbet throwne,
            No pardon then can ſaue theyr liues.
            Such good aduice as comes too late,
            May wel be calde, Sir fore wits foole:
            Elswhere goe play the coſoning mate,
            I am not now to goe to ſchoole.
            But cléerely doe at length diſcerne,
            The marke to which your bow is bent,
            And theſe examples ſhall me warne,
            What harme they haue that late repent.
            Your ſugred ſpéech was but a baite,
            Wherwith to bleare my ſimple eyes,
            And vnder them did lurke deceipt,
            As poyſon vnder hony lies.
            Wherefore ſince now your drift is knowne,
            Goe ſet your ſtaule ſome other where:
            
            I may not ſo be ouerthrowne,
            Your double dealings make me feare.
            When ſtéede by théeues is ſtolne away,
            I wil not then the doore locke faſt,
            Wherfore depart without delay,
            Your words are winde, your ſute is waſt.
            And this ſhalbe the finall doome,
            That I to your requeſt will giue,
            Your loue in me ſhall haue no roome,
            Whiles life and breath ſhal make me liue,
         
         
            For a Gentlewoman.
            VVHat luckleſſe lot had I alas,
            To plant my loue in ſuch a ſoyle,
            As yéelds no corne nor fruitfull graſſe,
            But crops of care, and brakes of toyle?
            VVhen firſt I choſe the plot of ground,
            In which mine Anchor foorth was caſt,
            I thought it ſtable, firme, and ſound,
            But found it ſande and ſ

            Like as the Fouler with his ginnes,
            Beguiles the birdes that thinke no yll,
            By fyled ſpéech▪ ſo diuers winnes
            The ſimple ſort to worke theyr will.
            But I, whom good aduice hath taught,
            To ſhun their ſnares and ſuttle charmes,
            Am not into ſuch daunger brought,
            But that I can eſchew the harmes.
            The ſkilfull Faulconer ſtill doth proue,
            And prayſe that hawke which makes beſt whing,
            So I by ſome that ſeemd to loue,
            Haue had the proofe of ſuch a thing.

            They turnde their traynes againſt the winde.
            Yée haggards ſtraunge therefore adiew,
            Goe ſéeke ſome other for your mate,
            Yée falſe your faith and proue vntrue,
            I like and loue the ſole eſtate.
            Like as Vliſſes wandring men,
            In red ſeas as they paſt along,
            Did ſtoppe their eares with waxe as then,
            Againſt the ſuttle Mermayds ſongue.
            So ſhall their crafty filed talke,
            Here after finde no liſtning eare,
            I will byd them goe packe and walke,
            And ſpend their wordes ſome otherwhere.
            By proofe experience tels me now,
            What fickle truſt in them remaynes,
            And tract of time hath learned me how,
            I ſhould eſchew their wylie traines.
            Such as are bound to Louers toyes,
            Make ſhipwracke of theyr fréedome ſtill,
            They neuer taſt but brittle ioyes:
            For one good chance a thouſand yll.
            Ceaſe now your ſutes and gloze no more,
            I meane to leade a Virgins life:
            In this of pleaſure find I ſtore,
            In doubtfull ſutes but care and ſtrife.

               In countrey ſtrange, oppreſt with grief &amp; pain,
               Doth nothing way his long and weary toyle,
               So that ye may come to his home againe:
               And not accounts of perils great at hand,
               For to attayne his owne deſired land.
               
               Such is the ſtate of vs thy ſeruantes all,
               (Moſt gratious God) that here on earth do dwell:

               From place of bliſſe, euen to the pit of hell:
               Our vice and ſinnes, as markes and ſignes wee haue,
               Which ſtill we beare, and ſhal doe to our graue.
            
            
               When that all hope of remedy was paſt,
               For our redreſſe when nothing could be founde:
               Thine onely ſonne, thou didſt ſend downe at laſt,
               To ſalue this ſore, and heale our deadly wound:
               Yet did they pleaſe to vſe him as a meane,
               Vs baniſht wights for to call home agayne.

               Heauen is the hauen in which we hope to reſt,

            THe bookes of Ouids changed ſhapes,
            A ſtory ſtrange doe tell,
            How Orpheus to fetch his wife,
            Made voyage vnto hell.
            Who hauing paſt olde Charons boate,
            Vnto a Pallace came,
            Where dwelt the Prince of damned ſprites,
            Which Pluto had to name.
            When Orpheus was once ariude
            Before the Regall throne:
            He playde on Harpe, and ſang ſo ſwéete,
            As moude them all to mone.
            At ſound of his melodious tunes,
            The very ſoules did moorne,
            
               Yxion with his whirling whéele,
            ſtoode ſtill and would not turne:
            And Tantalus did not aſſay,
            The fléeting floodes to taſte:
            The ſiſters with their hollow ſiues,
            For water made no haſte.
            The gréedy Vulturs that are faynde,
            On Titius heart to gnawe,
            Left off to féede: and ſtoode amaſde,
            When Orpheus they ſawe,
            And Syſyphus which roules the ſtone,
            Agaynſt a mighty hill,

            The furies eke which at no time,

            So great remorce can moue,
            I déeme that man bereft of wits,
            which muſike will not loue.
            She with her ſiluer ſounding tunes,
            Reuiues mans dulled ſprites,
            Shée féedes the eare: ſhée fils the heart,
            With choice of rare delights.
            Her ſugred deſcant doth withdraw,
            Thy minde from earthly toyes,
            And makes thée féele within thy breſt,
            A taſt of heauenly ioyes.

            Of which if creatures were depriud,
            This world could not remayne.
            It is no doubt, the very déede
            Of golden melodie,
            That neighbours doe together liue
            In loue and vnitie.
            Where man and wife agrées in one,
            Swéete muſike doth abound,
            But when ſuch ſtringes begin to iarre,
            Vnpleaſant is the ſound.
            Amongſt all ſortes of harmony,
            none doth ſo well accord,
            As when we liue in perfect feare,
            And fauour of the Lord.
            Who graunt vnto vs ſinfull wightes,
            Sufficient power and might,
            According to his mercy great,
            To tune this ſtring aright.
         
         
            
            A pleaſaunt Ieſt.
            
               SOmetimes in Fraunce it did ſo chaunce,
               One that did ſeruice lacke:
               A country clowne went vp and downe,
               With fardell on his backe.
               When that this ſwad long trauailde had,
               Some ſeruice to require:
               His fortune was, as hée did paſſe,
               A farmar did him hire.
               When Aprill ſhowres, y• brings May flowers,
               Made ſpring time bud and ſprout:
               This country ſwaine, for maiſters gaine,
               Did ride his fieldes about:
               Now as he road, in ground abroad,
               In prime of pleaſaunt ſpring:
               Hard by their towne, this country clowne,
               Did heare two cuckoes ſing:
               One of them ſat faſt by a gate,
               In their towne fielde, which ſtoode
               In place néereby, hée might diſcry
               The other in a wood.
               Theſe Cuckoes ſéemde, as lobcocke déemde,

               Which of them twaine, in playne ſong vaine,
               The other could amend.
               Thus ſange they long, their woonted ſong,
               Their townefielde Cuckoes throate
               Was nothing cléer, which chaungd the chéere
               Of farmers man, God wote.
               His horſe hée ties, and faſt hée hies,
               Vpon a trée to ſtand:
               
               And made a noyſe, with Cuckoes voyce,
               To get the vpper hand.
               Hée thought not good, hée of the wood,
               Should beare away the prayſe:
               To make him yéeld, to him of fielde,
               Himſelfe the Cuckoe playes.
               Cuckoe, quoth hée, vpon the trée,
               And cuckoe, cuckoe ſayde,
               With cuckoe, cuckoe, &amp; cuck cuck cuckoe,
               Long time theſe cuckoes playde.
               As they thus ſtand, from woodes at hand
               Two wolues for pray that ſought,
               By chaunce eſpyed, the horſe faſt tyed,
               That lobcocke thither brought,
               To him they hye, and preſently,
               In péeces did him teare:
               Whereat amaſde, the lobcocke gazde,
               And piſt himſelfe for feare.
               When Wolues were gone, comming downe anone,
               Homewardes hée hide with ſpéede:
               And there doth tell, all that befell,
               Of this vnluckie déede.
               His maiſter ſwore, being wroth therfore,
               He would none other nay,
               But that the flaue, and fooliſh knaue,
               The price of horſe ſhould pay.
               But to procéede, it was agréed,
               The wiues that there did dwell,
               The caſe ſhould ſcan, of this poore man,
               If hée did ill or well.
               It being ſéene, hée did it in.
               Defence of all the towne:
               With one intent, they gaue conſent,
               For to accquite the clowne.
               They eke him gaue a garland braue,
               Adornd with many a roſe:
               
               And great and ſmall, him captaine call
               Of Cuckoes, where he goes.
               Now in my minde, hée were vnkinde,
               That would wiſh any ill:
               Vnto a wight, in townſhips right,
               That ſhewd ſo great goodwill.
            
         
         
            A Newyeeres gift to a
Gentlewoman.
            
               IF pure goodwill, not meaning ill, might boldly, might boldly,
               Preſume to tell his minde:
               I wold not vſe, in terms diffuſe, thus coldly, thus coldly
               To ſhew my ſelfe a friend.
               But now adayes, ſo ſinne preuailes,
               That fayth decaies, and friendſhip fayles,
               Moſt men are ſo infected with ielous muſing braines,
               That truſt as one reiected, forſaken cleane remaines.
               And thinges are conſtred cleane awry,
               When nought was meant but honeſtie.
            
            
               Thus much I ſay, as by the way, reciting, reciting,
               What daunger may enſue:
               Becauſe that I ſuſpiciouſly, in writing, in writing,
               Doe ſend my minde to you.
               Some will ſurmiſe, that I p

                  etend,
               By ſuch deuice ſome naughtie end:
               But let them ſpeak and ſpare not, I force it not a beane,
               For al their talke I care not, whilſt guiltles I remaine.
               Such as haue not tranſgreſt the lawes,
               Doe neuer feare to pleade their cauſe.
            
            
               But now, ſwéete heart, it is my part; to open, to open,
               The ſumme of mine intent:
               
               I ſend this bil, for pure goodwill, in token, in token,
               That former yéere is ſpent.
               It is in déede a ſimple ſhift:
               To ſerue in ſtéede of new yéeres gift,
               Though ſlenderly I make it, your pardon let mée haue▪
               
               If in good part you take it, no more of you I craue:
               So ſhall you binde mée day by day,
               To pleaſure you in what I may.
            
            
               But I offend, ſuch words to ſpend, in ſéeking, in ſéeking,
               That you ſhould pardon mée:
               If oft I doe, that bréedes in you, miſliking, miſliking,
               Corrected let mée bée.
               My ſelfe to you I yéelde and giue,
               As priſoner true, whilſt that I liue:
               So may you be reuenged, for my preſumptuous heart:
               Which hath perhaps offended, to play ſo leawd a part.
               Condemne mée to bée priſoner ſtill,
               So may you boldly worke your will.
            
            
               Procéede my déere, the caſe is cléere, now ſtay not, now ſtay not
               Giue iudgement out of hand:
               If you ordaine, perpetuall paine, I way not, I way not,
               Your iuſt decrée ſhall ſtand.
               And if you will award it ſo,
               That I muſt now to priſon go:
               Your heart ſhall bée the priſon, wherin I will abyde,
               Vntill by right and reaſon, my caſe bée throughly tride.

               AS late abroad aſléepe I lay,
               Mée thought I came by wondrous chaunce:
               
               Whereas I heard a harper play,
               And ſaw great ſtore faeries daunce.
               I marched néere, drawne by delight,
               And preſt theſe gallant Dames among:
               When as their daunce being ended quite,
               Of him that playde they craue a ſong.
               My preſence nought appalde their minde,
               Hée tunde his harpe, his voyce was cléere:
               And as a foe to woman kind,
               He ſang this ſong that foloweth héere.
            
            
               
                  A Womans face is full of wiles,

               With outward chéere on thée ſhée ſmiles,
               When in her heart ſhée thinkes thée ill.
               Her tongue ſtill chattes of this and that,

               And as ſhe talkes ſhée knowes not what,
               There yſſues many a troathleſſe blaſt.
               Thou farre doeſt take thy marke amiſſe,
               If thou thinke fayth in them to finde:
               The Wethercocke more conſtant is,
               Which turnes about with euery winde.
               O, how in pittie they abound!
               Their heart is milde, like marble ſtone,
               If in thy ſelfe no hope bée found,
               Be ſure of them thou getteſt none.
               I know ſome pepernoſed dame
               Will tearme mée foole and ſawcie iack,
               That dare their credit ſo defame,
               And lay ſuch ſlaunders on their backe.
               What though on mée they powre their ſpite,
               I may not vſe the gloſérs trade,
               I cannot ſay the crow is white,
               But néedes muſt call a ſpade a ſpade.
               
               Héerewith his ſongue and muſik ceaſt,
               The Faeries all on him did frowne:
               A ſtately dame amongſt the reſt,
               Vpon her face falles proſtrate downe.
               And to the Gods requeſt did make,
               That ſome great plagues might bée aſſind
               To him, that all might warning take,
               How they ſpeake ill of womankind.
            
            
               Héerewith (a wonder to bée tolde)
               His féete ſtoode faſt vpon the ground.
               His face was neither young, nor olde,
               His harpe vntoucht, would, yeeld no ſound.
               Long hayre did grow about his ſ

                  ull,
               His ſkinne was white, his blood was read,
               His paunch with guts was bombaſt full,
               No dogge had euer ſuch a head.
               His coulour oft did goe and come,
               His eies did ſtare as hée did ſtand:
               Alſo foure fingers and a thombe,
               Might now bée ſeene in eyther hand,
               His tongue likewiſe was plagued ſore,
               For that it played this péeuiſh parte,
               Becauſe it ſhould offend no more,
               'Twas tyed with ſtringes vnto his heart.
               Yet in his mouth aboad ſhée ſtill,
               His téeth like walles did kéepe her in:
               Which now grinde meate, much like a mill,
               His lippes were placde aboue his chinne.
               Thus was hée chaungd, that none him knew,
               But for the ſame hée was before:
               By ſilent ſignes hée ſéemde to ſue,
               That Gods would now torment no more.
               And hée would there without delayes,
               Recant all that, which erſt hée ſpake.
               
               Hée pardoned is, on harpe hée playes,
               And preſently this ſongue did make.
            
            
               AMongſt all creatures bearing life,
               A woman is the worthyeſt thing:
               Shée is to man a faythfull wife:
               Shée mother was to Chriſt our king.
               If late by mée they were accuſde,
               I haue therefore receiued my hyre:
               Vnleſſe they greatly bée abuſde,

               They neither chide, fight, brawle, nor lye,
               The gentleſt creatures vnder ſunne:
               When men doe ſquare for euery fly,
               To make them friends the women runne,
               And where they chaunce to fixe their loue,
               They neuer ſwarue, or ſeeke for chaunge:
               No new perſwaſions can them moue,
               Tis men that haue deſire to raunge.
               Like Turtles true they loue their ſpowſe,
               And doe their duties euery way:

                   hey fée good orders in the houſe,
               When huſbands are abroad at play.
               And to conclude they Angells are,
               Though héere on earth they doe remaine,
               Their glittering hew, which ſhines like Star,
               And bewtie braue declares it playne.
            
            
               This ſayde, the Faeries laught,
               And ſéemd in countenance very glad,
               To ſpeake my minde, I then had thought.
               How ſome were good, and ſome were bad,
               But (marke ill happe) a friend came by,
               Who as hée found mée ſléeping ſo,
               Did call mée vp with voyce ſo hye,
               That ſlumber ſwéete I did forgoe.
            
         
         
            
            To his moſt faythfull
friend.
            
               A Thing moſt ſtraunge to tell, of late did chaunce to me:
            whiles y• I tooke my pen in hād, to writ my mind to thée,
            As I had thought in haſt to pach a verſe or two,
            Without regarde, as common friends, accuſtomd oft to doe:
            I could not for my life, mine eies ſo waking kéepe,
            But that a ſodain ſlumber came, which made mée fal aſléep,
            In dreame I ſéemde to ſée, appeare before mine eine,
            A comely Lady well be ſéene, attirde in decent wiſe,
            Moſt modeſt were her lookes, moſt chéerefull eke her face,
            Me thought therin was picturd out, a worthy matrōs grace.
            O thankleſſe wretch, ſhée ſaid, and canſt thou ſo neglect
            My worthy lawes? is there wt thée of frends no more reſpect?
            Doſt know to whome thou writeſt? is he a common frende?
            Suffiſeth it in cōmon ſort, that thou ſhouldſt ſhew thy mind.
            Hath his deſarts deſerude of thée no better méede?
            Is this due guerdon for y• loue, which did from him procéed?
            In that he hath in déedes, byn alwaies friend to thée,
            Let him peceiue by friendly words, thée thankful ſtil to be.
            He lookes not for thy déeds, he knowes thy power is ſmal,
            And wilt thou then depriue him, wretch, of words, of déeds &amp; al?
            Brute beaſts requite good turnes, it cannot be denied,
            Wilt thou thē be vngrateful which haſt reaſō for thy guid?
            Shal friendſhip dwell in beaſts, and men be found vnkinde?
            Shal they for loue, ſhew loue agayn, &amp; thou forget thy friend?
            With that ſhée gaue a becke, and bad me to awake,
            And ſaid, doe ſhew thy thankful mind, &amp; ſo requitall make.
            Herewith ſhée did depart, my ſlumber paſt away,
            
            I felt my chéeks bedewd wt tears, through words y• ſhe did ſay
            Her bitter ſharpe rebukes, did make me muſe a ſpace,
            Chiefly in that they did procéede, out from ſo fayre a face.
            But then I cald to minde, that Gratitude ſhe was,
            That thākful Dame whoſe cuſtom is frō friend to friend to paſſe.
            I tooke my pen in hand, with purpoſe to declare
            The Circumſtance of this my dreame, wt cloyd my hed with care,
            Herein alſo I thought her precepts to obey,
            And al the plot of thy deſerts, moſt largely to diſplay,
            But when my dreame was done, I found ſuch litle ſtore:
            Of paper, that I could not haue, wherin to write the more.
         
         
            ¶One that had a frowarde Huſband,

            That rightly may compare.
            Or goe beyond me ſilly wretch,
            In ſadneſſe and in care?
            Some ſuch may be, but this I ſay,
            One muſt goe farre to ſéeke,
            To finde a woman in this worlde,
            Whoſe griefe to mine is like:
            Or hath ſo iuſt a cauſe of moane,
            In dumps of déepe deſpite,
            I linger on my loathſome life,
            Depriud of all delight.
            Men ſay the Phoenix is a birde,
            Whoſe like cannot bée found,
            I am the Phoenix in this worlde,
            Of that thoſe care doth wound.
            
            And he that workes me all this woe,
            May be the Phoenix well,
            Of all enraged ſenſleſſe wightes,
            That in the earth doe dwell.
            I moane not here as Dido did,
            Being ſtryken at the heart,
            As woorthy Virgill doeth recorde,
            With dint of Cupids dart.
            Nor in my playnts ſome Louer name,
            As Sappho did of yore:
            But huſband is the cauſe héereof,
            Which makes my griefe the more.
            For Louers if they like vs not,
            We may caſt of agayne,
            But with our huſbandes (good or bad)
            Till death we muſt remayne.
            I doe not ſpeake theſe wordes, as if
            His death I did deſire,
            But rather that it might pleaſe God,
            His thoughts ſo to enſpire,
            That he might vſe me as he ought,
            Or as I doe deſerue,

            Iſt not deſert, ſuch one with him
            In loyall bed to lie,
            As alwayes hath moſt faythfull byn,
            And will be till ſhée die:
            To looke on him with chéerefull face,
            to call him Spouſe and friend,
            To coll and kiſſe, all this hée hath,
            With franke and willing mynde,
            
            And all thinges els as God commaunds,
            And duety doth allowe,
            Yet am I dealt with at his handes,
            Alas, I know not howe,
            Hée thankleſſe man, doth ill for good,
            Agaynſt all right and lawe,
            Hée had of me good fruitfull Corne,
            And payes mée chaffe and ſtraw,
            For méeke and humble curteſie,
            Fierce cruelty hée geues,
            For loyalty, diſloyalty,
            And that which moſt mée grieues,
            Is when in ſwéete and humble ſorte,
            I come to make my moane,
            His heart no more is mollified,
            Then is the Marble ſtone.
            The cruell Lyon ready bent,
            With pawes and téeth to teare,
            When that the ſilly Hounde doeth yéelde,
            His malice doeth forbeare.
            When Attalus the Romayne hoſt
            Did erſt ſubdue in field,
            His heart to mercy was enclinde,
            Aſſoone as they did yéelde.
            Blacke Pluto eke the Prince of hell,
            Vneaſie to bée woone,
            When Orpheus had playde on harpe,
            His rankour all was done.
            By ſwéetneſſe and by curteſie,
            What is not wrought alas,
            Nerethleſſe the ſwéeteneſſe Feminine,
            Which others all doth paſſe
            Can nothing doe before the eyes,
            Of my hardhearted féere,
            The more that I ſubmit my ſelfe,
            The ſtraunger is his chéere.
            
            So that in wrongfull cruelty,
            And ſpite he doth excel,
            The Lions wilde, the Tyrants ſtoute,
            And monſters eke of hel.
            As ofte as I reuolue in mynde
            The greatneſſe of my harmes,
            I thinke how foorth the Fowler goes,
            with ſwéete and pleaſant charmes,
            To take the birds, which once betrayd,
            He eyther killes ſtraight way,
            Or kéepes them pende in penſiue cage,
            That flie no more they may.
            And ſo at firſt, I taken was,
            By his ſwéete fléering face,
            And now depriude of ioy alas:
            Am handled in like caſe.
            Now, if the birdes (as ſome auouch,
            Doe curſe his kéeper ſtill,
            In language his, why curſe I not,
            The Author of my yll.
            That griefe doeth euer greater harme,
            Which hidden lies in breſt,
            Then that which to ſome faithfull friend,
            By ſpeaking is expreſt,
            My ſorowes then ſhall bée reuealde,
            Some ſtedfaſt friend vnto,
            My tongue thereby vnto my heart,
            A pleaſure greate may doe.
            But vnto whom ſhoulde I diſcloſe
            My bondage and my thrall?
            Vnto my ſpouſe? No ſurely no,
            My gaynes ſhoulde bee but ſmall,
            Alas to whom then ſhoulde I moane?
            Should I ſome Louer chooſe,
            Who in my ſorowes and my griefes,
            As partner I might vſe?
            
            Occaſions great do counſell me
            To put this ſame in vre:
            Mine honour and mine honeſtie,
            Forbid ſuch raſhnes ſure.
            Wherefore ye louers al, adew,
            Vnto ſome other goe:
            I will obſerue my vowed fayth,
            Though to my greateſt foe.
            To whome ſhal I powre forth my plaints?
            To you moſt louing mother?
            For they by dutie do belong,
            To you, and to none other.
            To you I come to ſéeke reliefe,
            With moyſt and wéeping eies:
            Euen as the heart with thirſt oppreſt,
            Vnto the fountaine hies.
            If any ſalue in all the world,
            may ſerue to cure my wound:
            Dame Nature ſayes vndoubtedly,
            In you it muſt be found.
            Now if ſome ſuccour may be had,
            Aſſiſted let me be,
            But if it lie not in your power:
            Yet ſpend ſome teares with me.
            That yours with mine, &amp; mine with yours
            Might ſo kéepe moyſt the flowre,

               AS Souldiers good obey their captaines will,

               Then lead ſuch life as Conquerors doe vſe,
               In thy diſgrace, and wanting thy good will.
               But ſtrike the drumme, &amp; let the trumpet ſound,
               To take thy part, whole legions wil be found.
            
            
               So many eares as euer heard thée ſpeake:
               So many eyes as haue thy feature vewde,
               So many handes thy puyſance hath made weake,
               So many heartes thy beauty hath ſubdued,
               Ech of theſe eares, ech eye, ech hand, ech heart,
               (Swéet Captain) ſtil are preſt to take thy part.
            
            
               Ech eare, to heare when enuy ſéekes thy foyle:

               Ech gladſome heart, for victory to ioy.
               Thus euery part the truſty friend will play,
               For thy behoofe, whom God preſerue alway.

               O Lorde, in rage of wanton youth
               My follies did abounde,
               And eke, ſince that I knewe thy trueth,
               My life hath béene vnſound.
               Alas I doe confeſſe,

               Yet frayltie of my féeble fleſhe,
               Doth make me run aſtray.
            
            
               Aye me, when that ſome good deſire,
               Woulde moue me to doe wel,
               Affections fond make mée retire,
               And cauſe me to rebell.
               I wake, yet am aſléepe,

               Loe thus in life I daily die,
               And dying ſhall not liue,
               Vnleſſe thy mercy ſpéedily,
               Some ſuccour to me geue.
               I die O Lorde, I die,
               If thou doe mée forſake,
               
               I ſhall be likened vnto thoſe,
               That fall into the lake.

               WHo ſo attempts to publiſh and diſplay,
               Of Cupids thrals the ſtrange &amp; awkward fits,
               Doth ſeeke to count the ſand amidſt the Sea,
               And wades beyond the compaſſe of his wits:
               Whoſe griping greefes and paſſions to diſcloſe,
               Is to deſcribe a world of care and woes.
            
            
               More eaſie its to weild the weightie charge,
               That Atlas hath in bearing vp the Skies:
               
               Then to vnſolde, and picture out at large,

                  outh caresin louers breſts that lies.
               Whoſe reſt is toyle, whoſe ioy is endleſſe greife,
               They often ſue, but ſeeldome finde reléefe.
            
            
               Yf Plutoes denne that vgly pit of hell,
               Great griefly plague, and tormentes hath in ſtore:
               I dare auouch that thoſe in loue which dwell,
               Do taſt them all, and twice as many more.
               Which makes mée ſay, &amp; not without good cauſe,
               Thrice happleſſe wights, that yéelde to Cupids lawes,
            
            
               As Aetna hill doth belke forth flakes of fire,
               And hydeous ſounds are harde within the ſame:
               So Louers burne through inwarde hot deſire,
               And hollow ſighes burſt out amidſt the flame:
               Whoſe ſcorched harts diſpaire and anguiſh gnaw
               Lyke gréedy Gripes, that peck Prometheus maw.
            
            
               In mirth they moane, yet ſmile amidſt their woe,
               In fire they fréeſe, in froſt they fry ſtraight way:
               Swift legges to runne, yet are not able goe,
               Such is the ſtate, in which poore Louers ſtay:
               As houering hope dooth hoyſt them vp on hye,
               Feare clips their wings, ſo that they cannot flye.
            
            
               They fayne in hell, one only plague to fall,
               For iuſt reuendge to thoſe that doe amiſſe:
               But they that loue, are ſubiect to them all,
               And neuer féele one lightning howre of bliſſe:
               That (to conclude) thrice happy is their chaunce,
               That neuer knew to treade the louers daunce.
            
         
         
            
            A Newyeres gift to
Miſtreſſe C. P.
            SWéet wight be glad, pluck vp your ſprites,
            Old Friendſhip is renewd:
            Milde Concord hath thrown down the broth.
            That Diſcord lately brewd.
            Fowle Enuie, Malice, and Debate,
            In teares their time doe ſpend:
            In that the platforme which they layde,
            Came not to wiſhed end.
            The mightie Ioue, which ruleth all,
            Their prayers heard, no doubt:
            Elſe could not their hot kindled wrath,
            So ſoone bée quenched out.
            Thus farre their furie did preuaile,
            A time and place was ſet,
            Wheras at their appoynted houre,
            To try it out, they met,
            And dealt. For vowes had raſhly paſt,
            So long foes to abide:
            Vntill the one, the others force,
            In open field had tried:
            I ſhrinke, to thinke what horror great.
            Now gripes your heart through feare.
            I ſéeme to ſée ech member quake,
            As if yée had béene there:
            To heare my muſe vnto your eares.
            This dolefull tale to tell.
            Put feare to flight, caſt care aſide,
            All things are ended well:
            But Rancour vile, couldſt thou powre forth,
            Thy ſpite vpon none other:
            But that to combat thou muſt bring,
            My father and my brother?
            
            And I my ſelfe with eies muſt ſée,
            And view this dolefull ſight?
            Goe packe, thou haſt ſuſtaind the foyle,
            For all thy poyſoned might.
            For by the blowes that they did giue,
            Theyr friendſhip doth encreaſe,
            And in their heartes eſtabliſht is,
            An euerduring peace.
            The ſéedes that thou in them didſt plant,
            Are pluckt vp by the roote:
            Thy ſiſter Diſcord neuer ſhall,
            Againe ſet in her foote.
            For if in dealing of their blowes,
            Their handes had not bene bleſt:
            A late repent had made them rew,
            For harbouring ſuch a geſt.
            But of vngrate diſcurteſies,
            Wée iuſtly might complaine:
            In that entreaties would not ſerue,
            To make them friendes againe.
            If in their mad and brainſicke heads,
            Dame Reaſon had borne ſway:
            But malice, rancour, and debate,
            Had baniſht wit away.
            So that occaſion of this broyle,
            Was not our faythfull friendes:
            But theſe forenamed furies fell,
            And other helliſh fiendes.
            Whoſe daily driftes are to deface,
            Of friends the pure eſtate:
            And makes them barbour in their hearts,
            Great heapes of deadly hate:
            In that things paſt, betwixt them are
            For giuen and forgot:
            Let vs imbrace and loue them ſo,
            As if this happened not.
            
            If ſtraunge it ſeeme, that ſtraunger I,
            in verſe to you doe write:
            Aſſure your ſelfe, it doeth proceede,
            through greatneſſe of delite,
            That I conceaue in that I ſee,
            them reconcilde ſo well,
            Whome no perſwaſions latelie ſerude,
            their furies to expell.
            Theſe ſimple verſes to your viewe,
            I haue thought good to ſende,
            In token of a good neweyeere,
            and ſo farewel, I ende.
         
         
            A ſtraunge hiſtorie.
            
               YEe that would heare a Story ſtraunge
               To this example rare,
               Attentiuely take héede:
               Which pictures héere, before your face,
               A worthy wight indéede.
               A Phenix well ſhe may be calde,
               Whoſe lyke cannot be founde,
               Chaſt Camna was her name:
               Endued with ſuch comely giftes,
               As none can tell the ſame.
               All wiues that in thoſe dayes did lyue,
               This woman did excell:
               In conſtant loue towardes her ſpouſe,
               As doth my Story tell.
               
                  Sinatus was her Huſbande cald,
               a gentleman by blood,
               Whoſe graue aduice in time of néede,
               did neighbours his much good.
               In ſuch chaſt loue this man and wife,
               togither did remaine.
               
               That no man could their ſpotleſſe life,
               With any blot diſtaine.
            
            
               In ſelfe ſame citie where they dwelt,
               A tyraunt vile bare rule:
               
                  Sinoris was his name,
               Who being taken with her loue,
               Did wooe this worthy Dame.
               When after many onſets giuen,
               Hée had ſuſtaind repulſe,
               His trauayle ſpent in vaine,
               Her worthy ſpowſe Sinatus then
               Hée cauſed to bée ſlaine.
               For he ſurmiſde the feruent loue,
               That ſhée to huſband bare,
               Did hinder him from his deſires,
               And eke procurd his care.
               This done, afreſh this tyraunt vile,
               Purſues in curſed ſuite
               Of her: then that hée did before,
               Hée reapes none other fruite.
               The ſecret flames of Cupids fire,
               Now broyled ſo in his breaſt:
               That nought but Camna could reſtore,
               
                  Sinoris wonted reſt.
            
            
               Reſolued fully was he then,
               To take this dame to wife,
               Though baſer in degrée:
               When no meanes els could ſerue his turne,
               To cracke her honeſtie.
               Then ſuite was made vnto her friendes,
               Who waying well his wealth,
               Would haue her néedes conſent.
               Shée after great denialles made,
               At length did ſéeme content.
               
               
                  Sinoris, when he heard this newes,
               Was paſſing meaſure glad:
               And order gaue in al poſt haſt,
               For mariage to bée had.
               To temple of Diana then,
               VVith ſpéede theſe couple goe:
               And with them ſundry worthy wightes,
               The mariage rites to doe.
               In outward ſhew ſhée did expreſſe,
               Great ſignes of mirth and ioy:
               But in her heart ſhée did contriue,
               This tyrant to deſtroy.
            
            
               Ere that they fully were aſſurde,
               Chaſt Camna bad one bring,
               To her a drinking glaſſe:
               Of which ſhée muſt to huſband drinke,
               As there the cuſtome was.
               She tempred had a pleaſaunt drinke,
               VVith balefull poyſon ſtrong:
               Of which ſhée dranke one part,
               And to Sinoris gaue the reſt,
               VVhich ſo did pricke his heart:
               That Phiſickes ſkill could not preuaile,
               To ſaue his vading life,
               VVhich well did pleaſe the minde of her,
               That then ſhould be his wife.
               When Camna ſaw that her deuice,
               Did frame euen as ſhée would:
               She gréetes Dianas Image there,
               VVith thankes a thouſand folde.
               And méekely knéeling on her knées,
               Ah Goddeſſe, then ſhe ſayde,
               Thou knoweſt from murdring of my ſelfe
               How hardly I haue ſtayde.
               
               Thou knoweſt, quoth ſhée, what bitter pangues,
               Hath gripte my heart with griefe:
               Since my deare huſbands death:
               And onely hope of iuſt reuenge,
               Prolonged hath my breath.
               VVhich ſince I ſee now come to paſſe,
               VVith gladneſſe will I die,
               And ſéeke that ſoule to finde:
               In life and death, which then my ſelfe,
               To me was déerer friend.
               And thou, thou caitife vile (quoth ſhée)
               Which didſt my mariage craue:
               In ſtéede now of a mariage bed,
               Prepare thy ſelfe a graue,
               But ſéeing then Sinoris dead.
               To huſbandes ſprite ſhée cryed:
               Oh, let not thy ſwéete company,
               To mée now be denied:
               Come méete me now my louing mate,
               Who ſtill I tender moſt:
               And ſaying ſo her armes abroad,
               She yéelded vp the Ghoſt.
            
         
         
            Amery leſt.
            SOmetimes in France, a woman dwelt,
            Whoſe huſband being dead:
            Within a yéere, or ſomwhat more,
            An other did her wed.
            This good wife had of wealth great ſtore,
            Yet was her wit but thin:
            To ſhew what happe to her befell,
            My Muſe doth now begin.
            
            It chaunced that a ſcholler poore,
            Attirde in courſe aray,
            To ſée his friends that dwelt farre thence,
            From Paris tooke his way:
            The garments were all rent and torne
            Wherwith this wight was clad:
            And in his purſe, to ſerue his néede,
            Not one denéere he had:
            Hée was conſtrainde to craue the almes,
            Of thoſe which oft would giue,
            His néedy and his poore eſtate
            With ſome thing to relieue.
            This ſcholler on a froſtie morne,
            By chaunce came to the doore:
            Of this old ſilly womans houſe,
            Of whome wée ſpake before.
            The huſband then was not at home,
            Hée craueth of the dame:
            Who had him in, and gaue him meate,
            And aſkt from whence hée came.
            I came (quoth hée) from Paris towne,
            From Paradiſe (quoth ſhe)
            Men call that Paradiſe the place,
            Where all good ſoules ſhalbe.
            Cham zure my vurſt goodman is dere,
            Which died this other yéere:
            Chould geue my friend a good gray groate,
            Some newes of him to heare.
            Hée ſaw ſhée did miſtake his wordes,
            And thought to make ſome glée:
            And ſaide, your huſband is in health,
            I lately did him ſée.
            Now by my troth (quoth ſhée) cham glad,
            Good ſcholler doe declare:
            Was not hée wroth, becauſe I ſent
            Him from this world ſo bare?
            
            In déede (quoth he) he was diſppleaſd,
            And thought it farre vnméete,
            You hauing all to ſend him hence,
            With nothing but a ſhéete.
            (Quoth ſhée) good ſcholer, let me know,
            When thou returnſt agayne,
            Hée anſwerd, Dame I will be there,
            Within this wéeke or twayne.
            Shée ſayde, my friend if that iche durſt
            Preſume to be ſo bolde,
            Chould pray thée carrie him ſome clothes,
            To keepe him from the colde.
            Hée ſaide he woulde with all poſte haſte,
            Into the towne ſhée hies,
            Hat, doublet, ſhert, coate, hoſe and ſhoes
            Shée there for huſband buyes,
            Shée praying him in earneſt ſorte,
            It ſafely to conuey,
            Did geue him money in his purſe,
            And ſo he went his way,
            Not halfe of halfe an howre was paſt,
            Ere huſband hers was come,
            What newes ſhée heard from Paradiſe,
            Shée tolde him all and ſome.
            And farther did to him declare,
            What token ſhée had ſent,
            Whereat her huſband waxed wroth,
            And woondrous ill content.
            He calde her ſotte, and doating foole,
            And after him doth ride,
            The Scholler was within a Hedge,
            And him a farre eſpide.
            Hée was afrayde, and downe doeth fling
            His fardell in a dike,
            The man came néere, andaſkt him newes,
            Of one whom hée did ſéeke.
            
            That bare a fardell at his backe,
            The ſcholler muſde a while,
            Then anſwearing, ſaid, ſuch one I ſaw,
            Paſſe ouer yonder ſtyle.
            With haſty ſpéede he downe alightes,
            And doth the ſcholler pray,
            Till he the man had ouertane,
            So long the horſe to ſtay.
            
               Ʋntill hée paſſed out of ſight,
            Full ſtill the ſcholer bides,
            Who taking then his fardell on
            His horſe, away he rides.
            When he returnd and ſaw himſelfe,
            By ſcholer flouted ſo,
            Your ſelues may iudge what chéere he made,
            If he were wroth or no.
            He ſware I thinke a hundred oathes,
            At length per mundum toots,
            
            For that he had no ſhoes to weare,
            Martch homewardes in his bootes.
            His wife did méete him at the doore.
            Hayée cought man? (quoth ſhée)
            No Dame (he ſayde) he caught my horſe:
            The Diuel take him and thée.
            With that ſhée laught, and clapt her hands,
            And ſayde cham glad ich ſweare,
            For nowe he hath a horſe to ride,
            He wilbe quickly there.
            When that her huſband well had wayde,
            That remedy there was none,
            He takes his fortune in good parte,
            And makes no farther mone.
            Now whether that this honeſt wife,
            Did loue her firſt good man,
            To ſuch as ſhall peruſe this tale,
            The caſe I leaue to ſcan.
         
         
            
            To his friend.
            
               IF thou wilt ſhun the pricking briers,
               And thornie cares that folly bréedes,
               Put bridle to thy fond deſires,
               Make reaſon miſtres of thy déedes.
               Attempt nothing by raſh aduice,
               If thou thus doe, then art thou wiſe.
            
            
               Where Wit to Will is ſlaue and thrall,
               Where fond affection beareth ſway,
               Ten thouſand miſchiefes do befall:
               And vertue cleane is caſt away,
               For hauing raſhnes for their guide,
               Such cannot chooſe but wander wyde.
            
            
               Their credite quickly lies in duſt,
               Which yéelde as bondſlaues to their will,
               And follow euery fooliſh luſt,
               Such leaue the good, and chooſe the yll,
               The wayes of vertue thoſe forgoe,
               And tread the pathes of care and woe.
            
            
               Wilt thou poſſeſſe eternall ioyes,
               And porte of bliſſe at length attayne?
               Still prayſe the Lord with heart and voyce,
               From doyng yll thy ſteppes refrayne.
               Theſe things obſerude, be ſure at laſt,
               In heauen with Chriſt, thou ſhalt be plaſt.

               To anſweare that my Velle would fulfill,
               So (make account) right farre hée muſt be ſought,
               That doth ſurmount or paſſe me in goodwill.
               Which as in wordes I haue geuen out to ſome.

               But will performe, what here I doe profeſſe.
               If that I ſhrink, when you haue cauſe to rid me
               Doe caſt me off, and vtterly denie me.

               Sunne moone and ſtarres, ech thing doth thée obey,
               And at thy voyce doe tremble all for feare,
               But man alas, yea man, whom thou doeſt make,
               More perfect farre then all things els that liue,
               Man whom thou wouldſt thy proper ſhape to take,

               And wit, and ſenſe for to diſcerne aright,
               What thing to take, what likewiſe to refuſe:
               He, he, vile wretch, and moſt vnthankefull wight,
               Thy maieſty, and honour doth abuſe.
            
         
         
            A Complaint of a Sinner.
            
               
                  O Lord moſt deare, wt many a teare, lamenting, lamēting,
               I fall before thy face,
               And for ech crime, done ere this time, repenting, repenting
               Moſt humbly call for grace.
               Through wanton will, I muſt confeſſe,
               Thy precepts ſtill I doe tranſgreſſe,
               The world with his vayne pleaſure,
               Be witcht my ſenſes ſo,
               That I could find no leaſure,
               My vices to forgoe.
               I graunt I haue through my deſerte,
               Deſerud great plagues and bitter ſmart.
               
               But yet ſwéet God, doe ſtay thy rod, forgeue me, forgeue me,
               Which doe thine ayde implore,
               O ceaſe thine ire, I thée deſire, beléeue me, beleue me,
               I will ſo ſinne no more.
               But ſtill ſhall pray thy holy name,
               In the right way my ſteppes to frame,
               So ſhall I not diſpleaſe thee,
               Which art my Lord of might.
               My heart and tongue ſhall prayſe thée,
               Moſt humbly day and night.
               I will delight continually,
               Thy name to lawde and magnify.
            
            
               With ſighes &amp; ſobs, my heart it throbs, remembring, remembring
               The fraylty of my youth,
               I ran a race, deuoyd of grace, not rendring, not rendring
               Due reuerence to thy truth.
               Such care I caſt on earthly toyes,
               That nought I paſt for heauenly ioyes,
               But now it me repenteth,
               My heart doeth bléede for woe,
               Which inwardly lamenteth,
               That euer it ſinned ſo.
               With many a ſigh, and many a grone,
               O Lord to thée I make my mone.
            
            
               Though furious fires of fond deſires, allure me, allure me,
               From thée ſo wander wyde:
               Let pitifull eyes, and moyſtened eyes, procure thée, procure thée
               To be my Lorde and guyde.
               As Scripture ſayth, thou doeſt not craue,
               A ſinners death, but wouldeſt him ſaue:
               That ſinfull wretch am I O Lorde,
               
               Which would repent and liue,
               With ceaſleſſe plaints I cry Lorde,
               Thy pardon to me geue.
               O Lord for thy ſwéete Ieſu ſake,
               Doe not ſhut vp thy mercie gate.
            
            
               Mercy, mercy, mercy, graunt me I pray thée, I pray thée,
               Graunt mercy louing Lorde,
               Let not the Diuel which meanes me euill, betray me, betray mee,
               Protect me with thy worde.
               So ſhall my heart find ſwéete reliefe,
               Which now féeles ſmart and bitter griefe,
               O Lord, I doe requeſt thée,
               To guyde my ſteppes ſo well,
               That when death ſhall areſt me,
               My ſoule with thée may dwell
               In heauen aboue, where Angels ſing,
               Continuall prayſe, to thée theyr king.
            
         
         
            A Dumpe.
            
               THE pangues, the priuie mones,
               The inward ſecrete ſmarte,
               The griefes, the heauie grones,
               That vexe my dolefull heart,
               So plundge my life in paines,
               And reaue mée of all ioy,
               That death is onely meanes,
               To ridde me from anoy.
               
               I graunt that vitall breath, preſerueth life in me,
               Yet liue I ſo, that death more welcome farre ſhould be.
               No wight was euer ſo perplexed with deſpite,
               I liue to taſt ech woe, and die to all delight.
            
            
               Although by outward looks, ſome déeme me void of thought
               Lookes are no certayne bookes, but beare falſe titles oft.
               For ſundry times I ieſt, when ioy (alas) is ſmall,
               And laugh amongſt the reſt, yet haue no luſt at all.
            
            
               Loe thus in ſecret ſtrife, my lingring dayes are led,
               I die yet am aliue: I liue, as being dead.
               The more I beare it out, as if I felt no yll,
               The greater griefes, no doubt, doe grow within me ſtill.
            
            
               The thing which doth amate, and moſt anoy my mind,
               Is that my hard eſtate, no remedy can finde.
               As one that loathes to liue, and daily calles for death,
               Theſe lines to thée I geue, in witneſſe of my fayth.
            
         
         
            A Dumpe by his friende. G. C.
            
               MY heauy heart in dolours drownde,
               Conſumes and pines away:
               And for me wreth, nought can be found,
               To cauſe my cares decay.
               Yée eyes of mine, helpe to bewayle,
               Powre foorth your briniſh teares,
               To rue, alas, his wretched ſtate,
               In whom no ioy appeares,
            
            
               How ſhould I wretch take any reſt,
               How can my heart féele ioy,
               
               When as the wight, that loues mée beſt,
               Lyes plundged in annoy?
               Whereto ſerue teares, but to bewayle,
               The loſſe of ſuch a friend:
               Wéepe eies, alas, wéepe on your fill,
               And neuer make an end.
            
            
               His troubled ſtate, if to redreſſe,
               The ſpending of my blood:
               Or that ſmall pelfe that I poſſeſſe,
               Could doe him any good.
               Then ſhould your eies ſomtimes permit,
               Mée ſilly wretch to ſléepe,
               But out alas, it may not bée,
               Wherefore ceaſe not to wéepe.
            
            
               Such inward griefe doth mée aſſayle,
               Through thought of his eſtate:
               That if I long of ſuccour fayle,
               All helpe will come too late:
               O ſacred Ioue, to cure theſe woes,
               Vſe thou ſome ſpéedie meanes:
               Or els, alas, with ſome ſhort death,
               Diſpatch mée of theſe paines.
            
         
         
            For his friend.
            LAte being new fangled, ſo fancie did moue,
            I was faſt entangled in nets of blinde loue,
            (Good friends, doe beléeue me) I choſe out a trull,
            Which daily doth giue me a ſhrewd crow to pull.
            Fauour with her felowes raiſde coales of deſire,
            Bewtie was the bellowes, that firſt blew the fire.
            
            Thus was I enflamed, no reaſon was left me,
            My ſenſes were lamed, my wits were bereft me.
            In hope of ſome fauour, I then fell awooing:
            Such was her behauiour, ſhe ſought my vndoing,
            Small is my promotion, moſt fooliſh, what ment I,
            To yéelde my deuotion, to ſuch a dame daintie?
            Since loue firſt ſoiourned, ſuch eaſe doe I féele,
            As Yxion, turned about on the whéele.
            Although by deſeruing, ſhe ought to be mine,
            With Tantalus ſtaruing, in griefe ſtill I pine.
            And through her controlling, my reſt is as ill:
            As Siſiphus rolling the ſtone vp the hill.
            Thus is my ſtate chaunged, déepe dolours do fill me:
            My mirth is eſtraunged, good death come and kil me.
            Whiles I héere in moning, the time out doe linger:
            My griefe and my groning, is falne in my finger.
            My finger, my finger, my finger, beléeue me:
            Alas little finger, ful ſore thou doſt grieue me,
            Was euer a finger perplext in ſuch taking,
            I thinke my poore finger will neuer leaue aking.
            The cauſe of my ſadnes, at length I coniecture:
            Is loue with his madnes, that bréedes this infecture.
            I force not a pinne, it forth now is gotten:
            Yet whole is the ſkinne, the fleſh is not rotten.
            I heard when it fel, now féele I no euil:
            Dame daintie farewell, adew to the deuill.
         
         
            A ſtraunge Hiſtorie.
            AYoungman once, by chaunce that loſt his way,
            Through deſerts wilde, as on a time hée paſt:
            Foure Lyons fierce, that ſought to gaine ſome pray,
            With gaſping throte, hée ſaw make at him faſt.
            Who running ſwift, to ſhunne this daunger great,
            
            Eſpied a well, ſmall trées about it gréewe,
            By which hée honge, and in the ſame did leape,
            Their ramping pawes and malice to eſchew.
            Thus as hée thought the perill to eſcape,
            Hée did diſcry a mightie Dragon fell,
            With open mouth moſt hidiouſly to gape:
            Him to deuour in bottome of the well.
            Then lifting vp his head, hée looked out,
            And might perceiue the Lions ſtill remaine,
            Which in ſuch ſort beſet the well about,
            That of eſcape, all hoping was in vaine.
            Thus as with death himſelfe beſiegde hée ſaw,
            A chaunce befell, which made him more diſmayde,
            Two beaſtes, one white, the other blacke did knaw,
            The little twigges, that him from falling ſtayde.
            With daunger thus deſette on euery ſide,
            Hée in a hole, behinde his backe did finde,
            A honny pot, which ſome man there did hide,
            Now caſting all his care out of his minde,
            Hée with one hand the honny ſwéete did taſt:
            The other did from falling him ſuſtaine:
            Vntill the beaſtes had gnawne the twigs at laſt,
            That downe hée fell, and ruthfully was ſlaine.
            This well, the world doth truely repreſent,
            In which wée liue in daunger euery houre:
            By Lions foure the elements are meant,
            VVhich dayly ſéeke all mankinde to deuoure.
            The Dragon fell, doth ſignifie our graue,
            The twigges ſelf loue, the beaſts, the night and day,
            The honny pot, the great deſire we haue
            To worldly ioyes, euen to our ſoules decay.
            Ech one therfore, I earneſtly aduiſe,
            Héere in this world to vſe themſelues ſo well▪
            
            And ſpend their dayes in ſuch a godly wiſe,
            That after death their ſoules in heauen may dwell.
         
         
            
            Farewell Court.
            The Preface to a Treatiſe enſuing,
compyled by the Authour, vpon a theme giuen
by his approued friend and kinſman
Maiſter A. D.
            I Haue, according to my promiſe, though ſlenderly, compiled
this ſimple diſcourſe on the theme that yee gaue
me, which was your Farwel to the court: which although
it be nothing ſo well handled, as by ſome experienced
courtier it might haue beene done: neuertheleſſe it being
conſidered, that my education hath beene ſo far diſtant
from the court, that I neuer ſawe the faſhions of the
court, I hope that the priuiledge of a pardon may bee
purchaſed for my excuſe in this behalfe. I haue heerein
introduced Witte and Wil as two domeſtical counſellers,
alwayes attendant on a man marching in this vale of miſerie:
The one giuing him truſtie and wholſome admonitions,
how hee ſhould here direct his life to the glory of
God, and his ſoules health: The other with the flattering
alluremets of the ſinfull fleſh, enticeth him to the purſutes
of the pleaſures of this worlde, in the end drouning him
in the puddle of al abhomination, to the vtter confuſion
both of body and ſoule. Vnder the perſon of Wit is prefigured
a man, hauing a certaine carefull regarde of his calling,
which is once in a mans life inſtilled into the harts of
thoſe, whome God hath ſealed vp vnto ſaluation, and
cauſeth them cleane to caſt away the vile and vaine vanities
that the wicked world accounteth as precious, and
addict all their doings towards the attainement of lyfe

euerlaſting. Vnder the perſon of Wil, is picturde out, how
a man letting flippe the bridle of his affections, is caryed
from the precious paths of perfect felicitie, to the ineuitable
daungers of drowning Caribdis: and ſo paſſing the
ſea of this world, not ſtopping his eares with the waxe of
vnderſtanding, the voluptuous pleaſures thereof, as ſubtill
Sirens, entice him to the folowing of them, whome
they preſently drown in ſuch delights, that he hath neuer
farther regarde to the preſeruing of his ſoule, but imitating
the nature of bruite beaſtes, addicteth himſelfe onely
vnto that, which his owne ſenſuall appetite ſhal allowe to
be good. Although this may, peraduenture ſeeme vnto
you, a too far fetched circumſtance, little or nothing pertinent
to the purpoſe: yet my hope is, that when yee
haue throughly peruſed it, yee ſhall not finde the theme
that ye gaue me, left altogether vntouched. The beſt is, I
know your thankfull diſpoſition to be ſuch, that how ſoeuer
it be, being willingly offered, it ſhal not of you be vngratefully
accepted. Thus referring the view heereof to
your diſcret conſideration, I wiſhe you and yours abundance
of ſuch proſperitie, as your heart deſireth.
            
               H. G.
            
         
         
            
            Farewell Court.
            
               
                  I Youth, when Fancie bare the ſway,
               Within my péeuiſh braine:
               And Reaſons lore by no meanes could
               My wanton will reſtraine:
               My gadding minde did pricke me forth,
               A courtiers life to proue:
               Whoſe golden ſhewes, and vaine delights,
               My ſenſes then did moue.
               Not halfe ſo faſt the bowdged ſhippe,
               The water in doth drinke:
               When foes by force of roring gunnes,
               Endeuour her to ſinke:
               As when the floodes of fond deſires,
               Came rumbling in my head:
               Which clean extinguiſht Vertues ſparks,
               That Nature there had bred.
               No power I had the ſinfull ſnares
               Of filthy vice to ſhunne:
               My good deſires did melt away,
               As ſnow againſt the ſunne.
               If wit ſomtimes would goe about,
               Mée wiſely to perſwade,
               How that I ſpent my time amiſſe,
               And vſde a naughtie trade.
               Then wilfull will would bée at hand,
               And plucke mée by the ſléeue:
               And tell mée plaine, wit was a foole,
               And could no counſell geue.
               His lores (quoth will) are very ſowre,
               His precepts are but colde:
               Doe follow mée, then all delights
               To vſe thou mayſt bée bolde.
               
               Hée talkes of ſcripture euery hower,
               Vnſauery to diſgeſt:
               And I will alwayes ſerue thy turne,
               With that which likes thée beſt.
               Who would not rather rome abroad,
               To ſéeke ſome pleaſaunt ſporte:
               Then to be pend in ſtudy faſt,
               Like ſouldier in a forte?
               To hawke, to hunt, to carde, to dice,
               To ſing, to daunce, to play:
               And can there bée more pleaſaunt meanes,
               To driue away the day?
               To toſſe the buckler and the blade,
               Lewd women to entice:
               Are not theſe vertues moſt eſtéemde,
               And had in greateſt price?
               To lend ech man a firiendly looke,
               And vſe the gloſers arte:
               In outward ſhew to beare good will,
               And hate him with our heart.
               Are not ſuch men as flatter beſt,

               When good aduice had tolde this tale,
               Proſtrate I downe did fall,
               And humbly holding vp my handes,
               Thus on the Lorde did call.
            
            
               OMighty God which for vs men,
               Didſt ſuffer on the Croſſe,

               In that thou doeſt vouchſaue,
               Of me moſt vile and ſinfull wretch,
               So great regard to haue.
               Alas none euer had more cauſe,
               To magnifie thy name,
               Then I, to whom thy mercies ſhewde,
               Doe witneſſe well the ſame.
               So many brunts of fretting foes,
               Who euer could withſtand,
               If thou hadſt not protected me,
               with thy moſt holy hand?
               A thouſand times in ſhamefull ſort,
               My ſinfull life had ended,
               If by thy gratious goodneſſe Lorde,
               I had not byn defended.
               In ſtinking pooles of filthy vice,
               So déepely was I drownde,
               That none there was but thée alone,
               To ſet my foote on ground.
               Whenas the fiend had led my ſoule
               Euen to the gates of hell,
               Thou caldſt mée backe, and doeſt me chooſe,
               In heauen with thée to dwell,
               Let furies now fret on their fill:
               Let Sathan rage and rore,
               
               As long as thou art on my ſide,
               What néede I care for more?
            
            
               MY Prayer ſayde: me thought I felt
               Such quiet in my mynde,
               As ſhipmen after tempeſt paſt,
               In wiſhed harbour finde.
               My wil woulde then no more preſume,
               To rule in reaſons place,
               For good aduice would bée at hand,
               His doyngs to diſgrace.
               Who tolde me playne that wanton will,
               Did alwayes ſerue the Diuell,
               And was his buſieſt inſtrument,
               To ſtirre vp men to euill.
               Although the gallant be ſo braue,
               And ſell ſuch pleaſures here,
               They that beſt cheape doe buy the ſame,
               Shall find it all too déere.
               Yet they that woulde aduenture there,
               The Diuell and all may gayne.
               With euery inch of pleaſant ioyes,
               He ſelles ten Elles of payne.
               If that thou wiſely wilt foreſée,
               Such winnings to eſchew,
               Ere beggery take thée by the backe,
               Doe byd the Court adew.
               Hencefoorth exile vile wanton will,
               Which is thy chéefeſt foe,
               Goe get thée home: liue to thy ſelfe,
               And let all courting goe.
               Experience now ſhould make thée know,
               What vice in court doth rayne,
               And tract of time ſhoulde teach thée ſhunne
               Her pleaſures mixt with payne,
               
               Though ſome may dayly there be ſéene,
               That follow vertue ſtill,
               Which honour God, obey their Prince,
               And flie from dooyng ill,
               Yet ſure, of them the greateſt parte
               Are carried ſo away
               With vayne delightes, that they ne thinke,
               Nor mynde their ſoules decay.
               O that I here tolde not a lye,
               O, were it not too true:
               That very few, theyr Princeſſe ſteppes,
               In godlineſſe enſue.
               Should I paſſe on her golden giftes
               And graces to declare?
               The ſandes in bottome of the Seas,
               More eaſily numbred are.
               If tongue or pen ſhould take in hand,
               Her vertues to vnfolde,
               Tongue ſhould not ſpeake, pen would be worne
               Ere halfe the tale were tolde.
               Shée is (next God) the onely ſpring,
               From which our welfare flowes:
               She is a trée, on which nought els,
               But graftes of goodneſſe growes.
               Shée is a Sunne that ſhines on vs,
               with beames of bliſſefull happes,
               Shée is a dew that daily drops,
               Great plenty in our lappes.
               When angry Neptune ſhipwracke threats,
               Through force of wreſtling waues
               Shée is a port of ſafe refuge,
               Which vs from daunger ſaues.
               When duſkie cloudes of errors blacke,
               Had dimde our ioyfull day,
               Through Chriſt ſhée cauſde the Goſpell ſhine
               Which draue them all away.
            
            
               
               Shée worthy ſtatutes hath ordaynd,
               To kéepe men ſtill in awe,
               But euery man vnto himſelfe,
               Will now ſet downe a lawe,
               Such as his will doth fancy beſt,
               They neuer care how bad,
               Nor farre from God and godlineſſe,
               So pleaſure may be had.
               If lawleſſe luſt were lawfull loue,
               If wauering wordes were déedes,
               Then would the Court bring foorth more fruite,
               And not ſo many wéedes.
               Thou knoweſt among the courting crew,
               How little fayth is forced:
               Sound friendſhip from the moſt of them.
               Is vtterly deuorced.
               Who cannot flatter, gloſe and lie,
               And ſet thereon a face,
               Is neuer able for his life,
               To get a Courtly grace.
               Who ſweates not in his ſutes of ſilke,
               And is not paſſing braue,
               Amongſt them beares no countenance,
               They déeme him but a ſlaue
               As long as thou haſt ſtore of coyne,
               And ſpendſt it with the beſt,
               In outward ſhew great friendlineſſe,
               To thée ſhalbe profeſt.
               But if thy wealth begin to weare,
               If pence begin to fayle thée,
               Theyr friendſhip then in time of néede,
               But little ſhall auayle thee.
               For they will ſhrinke their heades aſide,
               And leaue thée poſts alone,
               If twenty were thy friendes before,
               Now hardly getſt thou one.
               
               I pray thée let vs ſcan this caſe,
               And doe thou ſadly tell,
               What thing at firſt, did make thée like,
               And loue the Court ſo well?
               Didſt thinke that there a godly life,
               Might ſooneſt be attaynde,
               And motions of the ſinfull fleſhe,
               Moſt eaſily be refraynd?
               That cannot be, for all men ſée,
               How vice is there imbraſte,
               And vertue with the greateſt parte,
               Is vtterly defaſte.
               Did hope of wealth, firſt pricke thée foorth,
               In Court to ſpend thy life?
               Or didſt thou thinke that liberal gifts,
               With noble men were ryfe?
               If ought thou carrie in thy purſe,
               Thou quickly there mayſt ſpend it:
               But when thy landes, and rentes are gone,
               How canſt thou then amend it?
               To begge would gréeue thy loftie mynde,
               That earſt had ſtore of wealth,
               And hanging is the end of ſuch,
               as take mens goodes by ſtealth.
               Becauſe thou ſeruſt a noble man,
               Perhaps thou makſt no doubt,
               In hope that he at ſuch a pinche,
               Will alwayes beare thée out.
               Such hope hath hanged many a one,
               Whom wilful Will did guyde:
               By often proofe in theſe our dayes,
               Too true it hath béene tried.
               For when a halters ſliding knot,
               Hath ſtopt their vitall breath,
               He was (ſay they) a handſome man,
               Its pitie of his death.
               
               Thus all too late their pitie comes,
               But ſeldome comes their ayde,
               Wherefore doe not forget theſe wordes.
               That I to thée haue ſayde,
               Be not ſedewſte by wanton will,

            A Preface to certaine queſtions and
Riddles enſuing, tranſlated out of Italian verſe,
into engliſh verſe,
by H. G.
            
               AL yee vnto whome the skanning and viewing,
               Shal come of theſe queſtions, &amp; riddles enſuing:
               I let you firſt know thus much without fayning,
               That all of them carry a good and cleane meaning,
               If ſo they be conſtred aright in their ſenſe,
               Thus much may I boldly ſpeake in their defence:
               But if in ill part ſome fortune to take them,
               We fayle of the end, to which we did make them.
               Which was for the ſolace of them that can vſe them.
               What thinges can be ſound, if men wil abuſe them?
               To ſuch as are cleane, what can be vnpure?
               Such as are defilde, ill thoughts haue in vre,
               If of any riddle badde ſenſe ye pick out,
               Geſſe at it againe: ye fayle without doubt,
               And doe not aright his meaning expound:
               Their true expoſition is honeſt and ſound.
               And that ſhall be proued, if you will craue tryall,
               So truely, that no man will ſtand in deniall.
               Committing the ſequel to your approbation,
               I finiſh the preface of this my tranſlation.
            
            
               
               1
               
                  A Father once, as bookes expreſſe,
               Had ſonnes twiſe ſixe, nor more nor leſſe:
               Ech ſonne of children had ſcores thrée,
               Halfe of them ſonnes, halfe daughters bée.
               The ſonnes are farre more white then ſnowe,
               The daughters blacker then a crow.
               Wee ſée theſe children dayly die,
               And yet they liue continually.
            
            
               2
               A mightie blacke horſe, with gallant white winges,
               Within his graund paunch beares many ſtraunge things:
               Hée oft doth trauayle for mayſters auayle,
               And caryes his bridle tyed faſt to his taile.
               In going hée flyes twixtearth and the ayre,
               And oft, where they would not, his riders doth beare:
               Hée hath diuers eies, and yet cannot ſée,
               I pray you doe tell mée what may this beaſt bée?
            
            
               3
               A certaine thing liueth in place néere at hande,
               Whoſe nature is ſtraunge, if it bée well ſcand:
               It ſées without eyes, it flyes without winges.
               It runnes without féete, it workes wondrous thinges.
               To places far diſtant it often doth rome:
               Yet neuer departeth, but taryes at home.
               If thou doe it couet to féele or to ſée,
               Thy labour is loſt, for it may not bée.
            
            
               4
               What am I that wanting, both handes féete and head,
               Of all them that ſée me, being déemed for dead.
               Of breath haue great ſtore, and moue too and fro,
               Now vp, and now downe, now hye, and now low?
               Alas what hard fortune doth to mée befall:
               
               That guiltleſſe am ſpited of great and of ſmall.
               They ſtrike me, and puſh mee, South, Weſt, North &amp; Eaſt:
               Yet doe I no harme to moſt, neither leaſt.
               When as my breath fayling, I can doe no more,
               They then giue mée ouer, and neuer before.
            
            
               5
               I being the daughter of my vncles brother,
               Am now of late become a mother:
               And with my milke from my pappes which flowes,
               I nouriſh a ſonne, my mothers owne ſpowſe,
               Now tell what I am, declare mine eſtate,
               For I giue him ſucke, that firſt me begate.
            
            
               6
               None liueth more iocound in al the whole land,
               Though head doth lye buryed in mucke and in ſand:
               My beard it is gray, though not very old,
               The ſtrong I make wéepe, nor for heate, nor for cold:
               Yet ſuch is my ſtate, that the poore loue me well.
               And ſtil I am forſt with great men to dwell.
            
            
               7
               From ſouth and weſt commeth a ſtraunge warlike nation,
               Atti
                     •
                  de and apparel
                     •
                   in wonderfull faſhion:
               In garments milke white, theſe people are clad,
               Which ſtrike and oppreſſe both good men and bad,
               But fauour they ſhew in dealing their blowes.
               And ſaue him from danger, ech on his way goes.
               And on his backe caryes dead bodyes great ſtore,
               Which with their thicke buffets had beate them before,
               Great furies are kindled at end of the fray:
               VVhich makes this ſtraunge nation all vaniſh away.
            
            
               8
               Long is it ſince firſt to the world I came,
               Small am I of body, poore, féeble, and lame▪
               
               Yet none in this world, nor one neyther other,
               In richeſſe and ſubſtaunce ſurpaſſeth my mother.
            
            
               
               8
               Not long am I graunted this life to enioy,
               So many there are that worke mée annoy.
               O Lord how they rent mée, it cannot bée told:
               What torments I ſuffer in heat and in cold.
               One while am I drowned, ſuch hap doth befal,
               Then next doe they roſt me: yet this is not al.
               When thus they haue vſde me, they cannot forbeare me,
               Ere firſt being beaten, by péecemeale they teare me.
               Then ſerue I the turne of euery eſtate,
               But one kinde of people mée deadly doth hate.
            
            
               9
               Doe tell me my friends, what creature is hée,
               That two times is borne, as all men may ſée,
               And liueth a ſpace, though not very long:
               And often is killed, not hauing done wrong?
               VVhen y• his breath fayleth, it liueth no more,
               It then is baptiſed, and neuer before.
               Though many a one doe euill entreate it,
               They loue it right well, and often doe eate it.
            
            
               10
               A certain dead creature in mine armes I take,
               With her back to my boſome, great glée doth ſhe make.
               As thus I doe hold her, ſhe greatly doth chéere mée,
               And wel are they pleaſed, that ſée me and heare mée.
               Whilſt erſt it remayned in foreſt and field,
               It ſilent remayning, no ſpeech forth did yéeld.
               But ſince ſhe of life, by death was depriued,
               With language ſhée ſpeaketh, mens ſprites are reuiued.
            
            
               11
               A father begat me, yet I haue no mother.
               Nor Uncle nor aunt, nor ſiſter, nor brother.
               Straight when I was born, I began to floriſh,
               For euery eſtate tooke care me to noriſh,
               Thus many ſcore yéeres, they haue loued me full well:
               
               And eke entertaind me, amongſt them to dwell,
               All partes of the world I viewd in ſhort ſpace:
               And ſtill was bad welcome, in euery place.
               Though many by me, reape loſſe, care, and woe,
               They neuer will licence me from them to goe.
            
            
               12
               Hard fortun doth haunt me, by nature eſtranged
               From male into female, I often am chaunged.
               And where as before I liud well contented,
               With prickings and punchings I now am tormented:
               Now, more to accompliſh their gréedy deſire,
               They cruelly heate mee, and ſcortch me with fire.
               Though badly they vſe mée, ſo milde am I ſtill:
               That I yéelde them life that thus doe mée kill.
            
            
               13
               Amongſt the firiendſhips rare,
               Of which old writers tell:
               This may bée plaſte in higheſt roome,
               And doth deſerue it well.
               Whiles death with gaſping throte
               Did gape for bloody pray,
               Life conquered death, and ſaude that life,
               Which death did ſéeke to ſlay.
               That life which did this déede,
               As death would ſtraight haue flaine:
               That life which late by him was ſaude,
               Preſerude from death againe.
            
            
               14
               Begot wi hout father, in earth I remaine,
               And oft I am turnd, to my mother againe.
               By night and by day I labour alwaies,
               And with my ſharp ſauor both pleaſe &amp; diſpleaſe.
               Thus héere in this earth my race out I runne:
               And neuer haue iſſue, nor daughter, nor ſonne.
            
            
               
               15
               A female I by name,
               Am ſiſter to a brother:
               In all the world may not bée found,
               Our like, nor one nor other.
               For hée no ſooner dies,
               But I ſtraightwayes doe liue:
               And I oft yéelding vnto death,
               Still life to him doe giue.
               Oft after him I hie,
               And gladly would him ſtay:
               But hée than arow from the bow,
               More ſwiftly flyes away.
               Straight wayes hée folowes me,
               My preſence to attaine:
               And as hée fled from me before,
               I flye from him againe.
               Though ſtraunge our ſtate doth ſéeme,
               By proofe yée may it try:
               That both of vs are ſtill aliue,
               Yet both doe dayly die.
               That yée may better know,
               What ſtraungers great wée bée.
               Wee day and night doe dine and ſup,
               With men of ech degrée.
            
            
               16
               Two are we in name, though in ſubſtaunce but one,
               Firſt framed by arte then finiſht with mone.
               Before we are ready, for thoſe that will buy,
               Through greatneſſe of torment, wée howle and wée Cry.
               Yet féele we no griefe, for all this anoy,
               Great numbers by vs haue comfort and ioy.
               Who when for their profits we haue done what wée may,
               They then do reiect vs, and caſt vs away.

               Whiles that thy white banner abrode ſtill is ſpread,
               For then thou doeſt comfort both liuing and dead,
               But if thy blacke banner bée ſpread foorth in vew,
               All honour farewell, all gladneſſe adew.
               Such woe then thou bringeſt to more and to leſſe,
               As pen cannot write it, nor tongue may expreſſe.

               Of thée (O my friend) a thing I doe craue,
               Which thou neuer hadſt, nor neuer ſhalt haue.
               If that for thy ſelfe thou purpoſe to gayne it,
               Thy labour is loſt, thou mayſt not obtayne it.
               Although thou ſhouldſt liue a whole thouſand yéere,
               And ſéeke it, yet ſhouldſt thou be nothing the néere.
               Now if thou doe loue me, euen ſo as thou ſayeſt,
               Doe geue it. For truely, I know that thou mayſt.
