            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               The Contents of the firſt Booke.
               SECT. I. IN the firſt ſection it is proved there is a God.
               2 That there is but one God.
               3 All perfection is in God.
               4 And that after an infinite manner
               
                  
5 God is eternall, omnipotent, omniſcient, and abſolutely good.
               6 God is the cauſe of all things.
               7 Anſwer to an objection concerning the cauſe of evill.
               8 Againſt them which imagine there are two principles, the one good and the other evill.
               9 The whole univerſe is governed by God.
               10 So are all ſublunary things, yea every particular and ſingular thing.
               11 Which is declared by the preſervation of Empires.
               12 And by miracles.
               13 Eſpecially ſuch as were wrought amongst the Iewes, which are verified by the long continuance of their Religion.
               14 Alſo by the truth and antiquity of Moſes.
               15 And by the teſtimonies of ſtrangers and aliens from the covenans.
               16 The ſame likewiſe is confirmed

by predictions and other arguments.

               21 Which truth is further confirmed by tradition.

               23 But 
                     •…
                  ther many arguments make for it.
               24 Whence it followes that the end of man is his happineſſe and welfare after this life.
               25 Which to obtaine, true Religion muſt be ſought for, the ſame being the onely way to eternity.
            
            
               
               The Contents of the ſecond Booke.
               SECT. I. TO the end it may appeare that the title of true Religion, agrees to Chriſtian Religion, the Author here proves firſt that Jeſus once lived upon earth.
               2 And that hee ſuffered an ignominious and reproachfull death.
               3 Howbeit after his death, hee was worſhipped and adored by wiſe men.
               4 The cauſe of which their worſhipping him, could be no other then for the wonders and miracles that were wrought by him.
               5 And theſe miracles were not to bee attributed to any efficacy of rature, or to the power of the Devill: but proceeded onely from the power of God.
               6 The Author further ſhewes

the truth of Ieſus his reſurrection by ſufficient teſtimonies.
               7 He anſwers a doubt, for that the reſurrection ſeemes impoſſible.
               8 This reſurrection of Jeſus being granted it ſerves to confirme the truth of his doctrine.
               9 Chriſtian Religion excells all other Religions in the world.
               10 As is proved, firſt from the excellency of the reward which is promiſed and propounded thereunto.
               11 Whereupon by the way, an objection is anſwered, for that it ſeemes impoſſible for bodies once diſſolved, to bee reſtored againe to their former integrity.
               12 Secondly, the former truth is confirmed by the exact holineſſe of Chriſtian precepts, touching the worſhip and ſervice of God.
               13 Alſo from thoſe courteous duties of humanity, which wee owe and ought to performe to our neighbours, though hurt or injured by them.
               
                  
14 Alſo from the union and love of man and wife.
               15 From the uſe of Temporall goods and commodities.
               16 From an Oath.
               17 And from other Chriſtian Acts.
               18 Anſwer to an objection taken from the controverſies that are among Chriſtians.
               19 The excellency of Chriſtian Religion is further declared from the dignity of its author.
               20 From the wonderfull propagation thereof.
               21 Specially conſidering the weakneſſe and ſimplicity of them which at the beginning taught the ſame.
               22 Together with the great impediments which might have with-held men from imbracing it, or deterred them from profeſſing the ſame.
               23 Anſwer made to them that doe deſire ſtronger arguments.
            
            
               
               The Contents of the third Booke.

               2 Such bookes as have names of authors are the ſame mens writings whoſe names they beare.
               3 Concerning ſuch books as anciently were queſtioned the doubt taken away.

                   authority, as is proved from the quality of the writings themſelves.
               5 The holy pen men of theſe bookes writ nothing but truth, becauſe they had certaine notice thereof.
               6 And becauſe they would not lye.
               
                  
7 This is alſo evident by the miracles they wrought:
               8 And likewiſe becauſe the events of many things therein recorded, have made it appeare the ſame were divinely inſpired.

            OF THE TRVTH OF Chriſtian Religion.
            The Preface, ſhewing the occaſion of this worke.
            
               I Have eftſoones The occaſion of the worke. beene demanded by a man, that hath deſerved excellent well of his Country, and of learning, and of me alſo, what the argument of thoſe bookes was, which were written by mee in my Countrey language, in the behalfe of Chriſtian

Religion: Neither doe I wonder that hee ſhould make ſuch a queſtion: For hee that with ſo good judgement did apply himſelfe to the reading of all things worthy to bee read, was not ignorant with what skill that matter hath beene handled by Raymond Sebund, after a ſubtile Philoſophicall manner; by Iudovicus Ʋives, in divers Dialogues; but eſpecially with moſt learning and eloquence, by their famous Mornay. Wherefore the tranſlating of them into the vulgar tongue, was more for uſe, than for making any new worke: Whereof, what other men will judge, I know not, but this I am perſwaded will ſatisfie him, if I tell him, how that reading, not onely thoſe Authors above mentioned; but alſo the writings of the Iewes, for their old Iewiſh, and alſo of Chriſtians, for our

               Chriſtian Religion; I thought good withall to uſe my owne judgement, (ſuch as it is) and give ſome f
                  •
               eedome to my minde, which my body wanted when I writ that worke. For it ſeemed to mee moſt ſitting to contend for the truth only with truth, and that alſo with ſuch truth, as whereof I was perſwaded fully in my owne minde. For I know it were but a vanity in mee to goe about to teach others to credit thoſe things that I could not bee perſwaded of my ſelfe: Therefore omitting ſuch arguments as in my judgement were of leſſe importance, as alſo the authority of thoſe bookes which either I certainly knew, or juſtly ſuſpected to be forged and counterfeit, I have made choice of ſuch reaſons both out of ancient &amp; later writings, as may bee beſt approved of. And as for thoſe

which pleaſed me beſt, the ſame I did both methodically diſpoſe, and alſo expounded as plainly as I could, diſtinguiſhing them by certaine verſes, whereby they might be the better committed to memory.
            For my purpoſe was to benefit all my Countrey-men, but ſpecially Sea-faring-men, that they might not (as too many doe) loſe and miſpend their time. Wherefore beginning with the commendation of our Countrey, which for skill and diligence in Navigation excels the ieſt, I exhorted them to uſe that art, not onely for their owne proper gaine and commodity, but alſo for the propagation of true Chriſtian Religion. For neither is there wanting matter for ſuch their endevours, ſince that they might try their fortunes abroad in farre diſtant-forren Countries, and

make incurſions either upon the Pagans, ſuch as live in Arabia and Guinea; or upon the Mahumetans, as thoſe under the dominion of the Turke, the Perſian, and Carthaginians; or laſtly, upon the Iewes, and ſuch as at this day are profeſſed enemies of Chriſtianity, which are diſperſed thorow the moſt parts of the world. Neither are there wanting ſuch wicked men, as doe (ſecretly for feare) harbour the poyſon of errour, and publiſh the ſame unto the weaker ſort, when they ſee fit opportunity. Againſt which evils my deſire is we may be well fortified with truth; And that ſuch as are furniſhed with learning, would endevour according to their ability to confute errours: and in the meane while let others beware that they be not ſurpriſed by thoſe that are enemies of the truth. For which end, that

I may make it appeare how that Religion is no vaine frivolous thing; in my firſt booke I doe beginne at the ground or foundation thereof, which is, That there is a God: This truth I thus proceed to prove, as followeth.

                  That there is a God.
               
               
                  THAT there are ſomethings

                     g, is cleare to common ſenſe, and by the confeſſion of all: howbeit thoſe things were not cauſes to themſelves of their owne being. For that which is not cannot produce

any thing, neither had it power to be before it was; therefore it followes, that the ſaid things had their beginning from ſome other thing different from themſelves: Which may be averred not onely of ſuch things as now we ſee, or ever have beheld, but of ſuch alſo as gave originall unto theſe, and ſo upward untill we come to ſome prime cauſe which never beganne to be, and which (as we ſay) hath its exiſtence by neceſſity, and not after any conting nt manner: And this, what ever it be, (whereof by and by wee ſhall ſpeake) is that which is meant by divine power or Godhead.
               
               Another reaſon to prove that there is ſome ſuch divine Majeſtie, is taken from the moſt manifeſt conſent of all Nations, ſuch I meane as have not the light of reaſon altogether eclipſed or aboliſhed by their ſavage

cruelty, and wilde affections. For ſeeing that ſuch things as proceed from mans will and arbitrement are not the ſame with all men, but often ſubject to mutability: yet this notion is every where admitted of, and never was denied by any, no not by Ariſtotle himſelfe, a man not very credulous in this kinde. Therefore there muſt needs bee ſome agent that extends it ſelfe unto all mankinde: which can be no other than either the Oracle of God himſelfe, or ſome tradition derived from the firſt parents of mankinde: The former whereof if we admit, then wee have that which is in queſtion; or if the later bee granted, yet there can no good reaſon bee given why we may thinke that thoſe firſt parents ſhould gull all poſterity with any fulſity in a matter of the greateſt moment.
               Moreover, whether wee conſider

thoſe parts of the world which were anciently knowne, or thoſe that are lately found out, whereſoever there is (as we have ſaid) any reliques of humanity, there certainly is this truth acknowledged, as well by ſuch Heathens as have any ingenuity and wiſdome, as alſo by thoſe that are of a more dull and ſtupid diſpoſition: The former whereof queſtionleſſe could not all bee deceived; neither is it likely that theſe later ſo ſi ly and ſimple ſhould any way deviſe how to deceive one another.
               Neither let any man here object, that in ſundry ages there have beene ſome moſt commonly, which either could not beleeve, or elſe would not profeſſe they beleeved that there was a God. For inaſmuch as the number of ſuch Atheiſts was but ſmall, and in regard that

ſtraight way upon the diſcuſſing of their rerſons, their opinion generally was ſet at naught; thence it appeares, that this proceeded, not from the uſe of right reaſon, which is common to men; but either from the affectation of ſingularity, ſuch as was in him that would needs demonſtrate the ſnow to bee blacke; or from a corrupt mind, like as when meats to a diſtempered palate doe taſte otherwiſe than indeed they are. But eſpecially becauſe both hiſtories and other writings declare that by how much any man was the more honeſt, by ſo much the more diligently did he preſerve and increaſe this knowledge in himſelfe concerning God.
               
               And further, that this conceit ſo oppoſite to the anciently received opinion, chiefly proceeds from the bad diſpoſition of thoſe whom it would moſt of

all profit or advantage if there were no God, that is, no judge of humane actions; 'tis evident in this reſpect, for that whatſoever they conclude or determine, whether it be concerning the ſucceſſion of ſome l
                        •…
                     age without beginning, or the confluence of Mores in the Sunne, or what other thing ſoever they ſay in this matter, the ſame hath in it no leſſe, if not more difficulties and abſurdities; neither can it be to any man, that doth but with indifferency ponder the thing, more credible than that opinion which is already received.
               As touching that which ſome men pretend, becauſe they cannot ſee God, therefore they cannot beleeve that he is; if they ſee any thing, they ſee enough to convince them; for if this were truth, what an indignitie were it for a man to beleeve hee

hath a ſoule, which notwithſtanding he never ſaw more than the divine eſſence of God; neither ought we to deny that there is ſuch a divine nature, when by our weake judgement we cannot comprehend the ſame; for this is common to every inferiour creature, not to bee able to comprehend thoſe things that be of a higher and more excellent nature. Thus the bruit beaſts conceive not what man is, much leſſe doe they know after what manner men doe ordaine and governe common wealths, meaſure the courſe of the ſtarres, or ſayle upon the Ocean; for all theſe things are beyond and above their reach. Foraſmuch then as man hath obtained a more excellent nature than the beaſts, and that not of himſelfe, thence hee may conclude, that that ſame thing whereby hee is advanced above the condition

of bruits, is as farre ſuperiour to him, as thoſe bruits are below himſelfe; and therefore ſome more noble nature there is which tranſcends his apprehenſion.
            
            
               SECT. II.
               
                  That there is ba
                        •
                      one God.
               
               THis being manifeſt then that there is a God, it followes in the next place that we ſpeake of ſome of his attributes; the firſt whereof is, that there is but one God, not many Gods. This truth may bee declared, firſt, becauſe God (as was ſaid before) is that ſame thing or eſſence which is moſt neceſſary, and of himſelfe. A thing is ſaid to be neceſſary or of it ſelfe, not conſidered in any other reſpect or notion, but truly as it is according to its owne nature and exiſtence; now all particular

things have ſuch actuall exiſtence and being. But if ſo bee thou ſuppoſe or grant there are many Gods, yet ſurely thou art not able to yeeld a reaſon why cach of them ſhould of neceſſity have their being; neither why any man ſhould beleeve that there are in number rather two Gods than three, or ten than five.
               Beſides, the multiplication of thoſe particular things that are of the ſame nature, proceeds from the exuperancy and fruitfulneſſe of the cauſes whence ſuch things more or leſſe are generated: but of God there is neither beginning nor any cauſe.
               
               Furthermore, in all particular things, there are certaine ſpeciall and particular properties whereby the ſame things are ſeverally diſtinguiſhed: Now to make ſuch a diſtinction in God, is altogether needleſſe and impoſſible, ſince that he is moſt

neceſſary and ſimple by nature; neither can any man perceive any ſignes or tokens of the plurality of Gods. For this univerſall Sphere or circumference which wee behold, makes up but one complete world, wherein there is one moſt beautifull and glorious part, the Sunne: Likewiſe in man, the little world, there is but one ſpeciall governing part, to wit, his ſoule or mind. Againe, ſuppoſe there were two or three Gods, which being free and voluntary agents, had power to will contrary things; yet hereby one would be an obſtacle or impediment to the other, ſo that they could not actuate and bring to paſſe their different or contrary deſires; now to ſay that God, who is an omnipotent power, can be hindred, were a great diſhonour to his Majeſtie. But let us proceed to ſome other of his attributes.
            
            
               
               SECT. III.
               
                  That all perfection is in God.
               
               
                  THat all perfection and accompliſhment is in God may bee thus demonſtrated. What perfection ſoever there is in all or any of the creatures, the ſame either had a beginning, or elſe it had no beginning: To have no beginning is the property of God alone; and whatſoever had beginning, the ſame muſt needs bee ſaid to have ſomething that gave to it ſuch being. And further, ſeeing that amongſt the creatures there is nothing that can be generated of nothing; it followes then that thoſe perfections which appeare to bee in any effects, were the reaſon why the cauſe thereof could produce any thing accordingly, and ſo all are accompliſht in the firſt cauſe. Neither muſt it be here

imagined, that the firſt cauſe can afterward bee deprived of it's perfection, either by ſome other thing different from it ſelfe, becauſe that which is eternall hath no dependance upon any other thing, neither can bee liable and ſubject unto their actions; or of it ſelfe, becauſe every nature deſires its owne perfection.
            
            
               SECT. IV.
               
                  God is infinite.
               
               ANd we may adde further, that theſe perfections which are in God, are in him after an eminent and infinite manner; for the nature of every thing is ſaid to bee finite and limited, either for that the cauſe whence it proceeded hath communicated ſuch a meaſure or degree of exiſtence, and no more thereunto, or for that the ſame nature was

not capable of any further perfection; Now there is no creature that doth communicate any thing unto God, neither is he capable of ought that any other thing can impart, hee being (as before we ſaid) altogether abſolute, entire, and neceſſary of himſelfe.
            
            
               SECT. V.
               
                  That God is eternall, omnipotent

                     , and abſolutely good.
               
               AGaine, foraſmuch as all things that have life, are ſaid to bee more perfect than thoſe without life; and thoſe which haue motion than thoſe which want it; and thoſe endued with underſtanding ſuperiour to ſuch creatures as lacke it; and thoſe which are good better than thoſe that come ſhort in goodneſſe; therefore from that which

hath beene ſpoken it followes, that all thoſe attributes are in God, and that after an infinite manner. Thus is he infinite in life, that is, eternall; infinite power, that is, omnipotent; So likewiſe is he omniſcient, and good beyond all compare

                  That God is the Author and cauſe of all things.
               
               Furthermore it followes from that which hath bin ſpoken, that what things ſoever ſubſiſt, the ſame haue their originall and firſt being from God: for we haue proued that that which is neceſſary of it ſelfe, can bee but one; whence we collect that all other things beſides this had their originall from ſome what different from themſelues.
               Now ſuch things as haue their

                  beginning from another, we haue ſeene before how that either in themſelues or in their cauſes, they proceeded from him which had no beginning, that is, from God.
               
               Neither is this manifeſt by reaſon onely, but alſo after ſome ſort by very ſenſe: for if we conſider the wonderfull frame and faſhion of mans body, both within and without, and how that each part and parcell thereof hath its proper vſe without the the care and helping hand of his parents; yea, and that with ſuch a grace, as that the moſt excellent amongſt Phyſicians and Philoſophers, could never ſufficiently admire the ſame; this verily ſhews the excellency of wiſdome in the Author and workeman of nature: concerning which matter Galen hath written well, eſpecially where he ſpeakes of the vſe of the eye, and of the hand. Yea

more, the very bodies of mute and bruit beaſts doe teſtifie the ſame: for their parts are not framed &amp; compoſed by the power and vertue of the matter whereof they conſiſt, but by ſome ſuperiour and higher cauſe deſtinating them to a certaine end.
               Neither is this plaine by man and beaſts alone, but alſo by plants and herbs, as hath accurately beene obſerved by ſome Philoſophers. This further is excellently noted by Strabo, concerning the ſcituation of the waters, which, if we conſider the quality of their matter, ought to be placed in the middle betweene the earth and the ayre, whereas the ſame are now included and diſperſed within the earth, to the end they might bee be no hinderance, either to the fruitfulneſſe of the ground, or to the life of man. Now to propoſe that, or any other end, to any

                  
                     •
                  ction, is the peculiar property of 
                     •
                  n underſtanding nature. Neither are all things onely ordained for their proper ends, but alſo for the good and benefit of the whole Vniverſe, as appeares particu
                  
                     •
                  arly in the water but now mentioned, which againſt its owne proper nature is moved upward, that their ſhould bee no gaping vacuity in the world; which world is ſo compoſed, that the parts thereof doe mutually ſuſtaine and uphold one another. Now it cannot poſſibly bee, that this common end ſhould bee thus intended together with an inclination of things thereunto, but by the power and purpoſe of ſome inteligent nature, whereunto the whole Vniverſe is in ſubjection. Moreouer amongſt the beaſts there are certaine actions obſerued to be ſo regular and orderly done, that it is manifeſt enough

the ſame proceed from ſome kinde of reaſon, as is plaine in Piſmires and Bees, and likewiſe in other creatures, which before they have experience doe naturally eſchew ſuch things that are hurtfull, and ſeeke after ſuch things as are profitable for them. Now that this inſtinct or inclination of ſeeking and judging things, is not in them by their owne power, it is cleare, for that they doe alwayes operate after the ſame manner, neither have they any vertue or efficacie to doe any thing which is contrary, or aboue their ordinary courſe of operation: wherefore they muſt needs receive their power from ſome reaſonable externall Agent, which directs them or imprints in them ſuch efficacie as they have, and this reaſonable and intelligent Agent, is no other than God himſelfe.
               
                  
In the next place conſider we the Starres of heaven, and amongſt the reſt, as moſt eminent, the Sunne and the Moone, both which for the fruitfulneſſe of the earth, and for the preſervation of living creatures, doe ſo ſeaſonably performe their courſe of motion, as that a man cannot deviſe any thing better. For though their motion thorow the Aequator were much much more ſimple, yet wee ſee that they have another motion by an oblique Circle, to the end, the benefit of their favourable aſpects might bee communicated to more parts of the earth.
               Now as the earth is ordained for the uſe and benefit of living creatures, ſo are all terreſtriall things appointed for the ſervice of man, who by his wit and reaſon can ſubdue the moſt rackle and impetuous creature among

them; whence the very Stoicks did collect, that the world was made for mans ſake.
               Howbeit, ſince it exceeds the ſphere of humane power, to bring the heavenly bodies in ſubiection to him; neither is it to bee imagined that they will ever ſubmit themſelves to man of their owne accord; it followes: therefore that there is ſome ſuperior minde or ſpirit, by whoſe ſole appointment thoſe faire and glorious bodies doe ſervice unto man, though he be placed farre below them; which ſame minde is no other than the framer of the ſtarres, even the Maker of the whole world. Alſo the motions of theſe ſtarres which are ſaid to be Excentricall and Epicycticall, doe plainly ſhew, that their eſtabliſhment and being is from a free agent, not by the power of the matter in them.
               
                  
Moreover, the moſt perfect forme and figure of this world, to wit its roundneſſe, as alſo the parts thereof, ſhut up as it were in the boſome of the heavens, and diſpoſed with a marvellous order, doe all expreſly declare, that they were not tumbled together, or conjoyned as they are, by chance, but wiſely ordained by ſuch an underſtanding as is endued with ſuper-eminent excellencie. For what Ninny is there ſo ſottiſh, what man ſo fooliſh, as to imagine, that ſo compleat and exact a worke as this, came to paſſe by hap-hazard? he might aſwel think that the ſtones and trees of any building were united into the forme of ſome houſe by chance, or ſcattered ſyllables and words became a Poem by meere fortune: A thing ſo unlikely, that even a few Geometricall figures eſpied on the Sea-ſhore, gave the beholder

juſt ground to argue, that ſome man had beene there; it being evident enough that ſuch things could not proceed from meere chance.
               
               Furthermore, that mankinds was not from all eternity, but at a certaine time had a common beginning, may be manifeſted by the courſe of Arts and Sciences, yea, by the very ground whereupon we tread, which was anciently rude and untill'd, but afterward became poſſeſſed with Iuhabitants; which alſo the language ſpoken in ſome Iſlands, derived from adjacent Countries, doth witneſſe. The ſame is apparent by certaine ordinances, ſo generally received amongſt men, that the inſtitution thereof may not be thought to have proceeded from the inſtinct of nature, or evidence of reaſon, but from the perpetuall and conſtant tradition of the Ancients,

which was ſcarce ever interrupted in any place, either by the malice or miſery of man: ſuch was that ordinance for the killing of beaſts in ſacrifice, uſed in former times, and ſuch alſo are now the modeſty and ſhamefaſtneſſe about venereall things, the celebration of marriages, and the baniſhment of inceſtuous perſons.
            
            
               SECT. VII.
               
                  Anſwer to that objection concerning the cauſe of evill.
               
               NEither need we unſay that which hath beene ſpoken, becauſe we ſee many evill things come to paſſe, the ſource and cauſe whereof being not from God, who (as before hath beene ſhowne) is good, after the moſt perfect and abſolute degree of Goodnes. For when we ſaid that

                  God was the author and cauſe of all things, we added withal that hee was the cauſe of ſuch things as really doe ſubſiſt: And no abſurdity (that I ſee) will follow, if wee aſſirme that thoſe things which haue true and reall exiſtence, may bee the cauſes of ſome certaine accidents, as namely of actions, or the like. The Almighty (we know) created both man, and thoſe more honourable ſpirits, the Angels, endued with liberty of action; which liberty in it ſelfe is not ſinfull, yet by power thereof ſome ſinnes may be committed: Now to make God the author of theſe ſinnes, which are morally euill, is no better than blaſphemy: how bee it there are other kinde of evils, ſo called becauſe they afflict ſome perſon with griefe or loſſe, and theſe we may affirme to bee inflicted by God for the reformation and amendment of

ſome ſinner, or for the puniſhment of tranſgreſſion; which to ſay is no impiety, ſince that ſuch evils haue nothing in them contrary to goodneſſe, but rather they proceed from goodneſſe it ſelfe like a bitter portion from a good Phyſitian.

               HEre by the way, it may be noted, that the opinion of thoſe men is to bee abandoned and avoided, which make two efficient cauſes, the one good, and the other evill: for from two contraries, there may follow the ruine and deſtruction, but in no wiſe a well ordered compoſition of things. Neither is this to paſſe for truth, to wit, that as there is ſomething good of it ſelfe, ſo

likewiſe there muſt needs bee ſomething abſolutely evill in it ſelfe; ſeeing that evill is a certaine defect, which cannot be but in a thing that hath existence, which very hauing of existence, or being is good.

                  That God doth gouerne the whole world.
               
               MOreover that this whole univerſe is governed by the prouidence of God, it is evident, for that not onely men, which haue right reaſon and vnderſtanding, but alſo the fowles, and beaſts both wilde and tame, haue in them ſome thing correſpondent to reaſon, and doe beare a kinde of prouidence, or reſpectfull care over the iſſue which they bring forth. Which perfection, ſince it is a part of

goodneſſe, muſt needs bee attributed to God; and ſo much the rather, becauſe he is both omniſcient and omnipotent, ſo that hee can no way bee ignorant of ſuch things as are done, or to be done, but can eaſily direct and order the ſame as he pleaſeth. Hereunto alſo may that bee referred which wee haue ſpoken before concerning the mouing of things contrary to their proper nature for a common end.
               
            
            
               SECT. X.

               BVt thoſe men are much out on't that include this providence onely with in the compaſſe of Celeſtiall orbs, and will haue it to deſcend no lower than the Moone: for that it is extended vnto euery creature, it is plaine; both by thereaſon but now mentioned;

as alſo for that the courſes and motions of the ſtarres; as the beſt Philoſophers doe confeſſe, and experience it ſelfe abundantly teſtifies, are ordeined and appointed for the vſe of man. Now it ſtands but with equity that that creature ſhould be mor
                        •
                      regarded for whoſe ſake another is ordeined, than that which is appointed for anothers vſe.
               Neither are they leſſe erroncous that ſay this prouidence is extended vnto univerſall things onely, and not to particulars; for if they will haue God to be ignorant of particular things, as ſome of them haue proſeſſed, then verily God could not vnderſtand himſelfe; neither ſhould hee be infinite in knowledge, as wee haue proued him before to be, if the ſame were not extended vnto euery thing. So then if God doe know theſe things, why can

hee not alſo haue care of them; eſpecially ſince that particulars, as they are particulars, are appointed for ſome certaine end, as well in ſpeciall as in generall: And the very entities or common eſſences of things, which by the confeſſion of the ſaid Authors are preſerued by God, the ſame cannot ſubſiſt but in their ſingulars; So that if theſe ſingulars, being forſaken by divine providence, may periſh, then likewiſe may thoſe generall eſſences alſo.
            
            
               SECT. XI.
               
                  This is further proved by the preſervation of Empires.
               
               ANother forcihle argument of divine providence particularly over humane affaires, both Philoſophers and Hiſtorians acknowledge to bee taken from the preſervation of Common

wealths: firſt in generall, for that whereſoeuer the courſe and order of ruling and obeying is once admitted, the ſame alwaies continues there: Then alſo, oftentimes in particular, it is evident by the long continuation of this or that very forme of government thorow many ages, as of a Monarchy with the Aſſyrians, Aegyptians, &amp; France; of an Ariſtocracy with the Venetians, and the like. For although mans wiſdome and policy haue ſome ſtroke in point of government; yet notwithſtanding if we conſider the multitude of wicked men, and the harmes that may proceed from without, and what mutabilities are incident to humane affaires, it may ſeeme impoſſible for any State ſo long to ſubſiſt, vnleſſe it were vpheld by a conſtant particular care, and by the power of a divine hand. Which is alſo further manifeſt

where it pleaſeth God to change the forme of government: for ſo it is, thoſe men whom he vſeth as inſtruments for the effecting of that matter, as being determined for him, ſuppoſe they were like to Cyrus, or Alexander, or Caeſar the Dictator, to them all things, even thoſe which are above the reach of mans prudence, doe ſucceed more beyond their deſires and wiſhes than the diverſity of humane caſualties ordinarily doth permit. The which ſo great correſpondence of events and concurrence of things to a certaine end, is an argument that there is an all-guiding providence: like as in game at dice, a man may happen ſometimes of a win
                        •
                     eing caſt, but if hee throw the ſame caſt a hundred times together, every one will ſay, this proceeds from ſome skill or cunning hee hath in the game: but to goe on.
            
            
               
               SECT. XII.
               
                  And by miracles.
               
               ANother moſt certaine proofe of Gods prouidence, may bee taken from thoſe miracles and prophecies which are recorded in hiſtories: Where though many fabulous things bee related in that kinde, yet thoſe things that were teſtified by ſufficient witneſſe living in the time when they, came to paſſe, ſuch I meane as were impartiall both for judgement and credulity, the ſame are not to be diſpiſed as altogether impoſſible. For in as much as God is both omnipotent and omniſcient, what can hinder him to demonſtrate what he knowes or what hee pleaſeth to doe, and that even beyond the common courſe of nature, which being made and ordeined by

him, becomes ſubiect vnto him by the title of creation? Now if any doe obiect that ſuch things might haue beene done by ſubordinate powers and minds inferiour to God: to them we anſwer, that ſo much may be granted indeed: but yet this makes way that the ſame may the more eaſily bee credited of God, who is to be thought either to work by the mediation of thoſe Agents, or elſe out of his wiſdome to permit them when they bring to paſſe any ſuch thing: like as in well ordered kingdomes there is nothing done againſt the ſtatutes and common lawes but by by the arbitrement or permiſſion of the Supreme Gouernours.
               
            
            
               
               SECT. XIII.
               
                  Specially among the Iewes, whereunto credit may bee giuen by reaſon of the long continuance of their Religion.
               
               NOw that therehaue indeed beene ſome miracles ſeene, though the credit of other hiſtories bee queſtionable, yet it is manifeſt enough in the Iewiſh Religion: which albeit, it was deſtitute of all humane helpes, yea, expoſed to contempt and ſeorne; yet for all that, it hath ſtill continued almoſt in all the climates and parts of the world even unto this day; whereas all other Religions (ſauing Christianity, which is the accompliſhment of Iudaiſme) haue either vaniſhed away, together with the power and authority of them that governed, as it is in Paganiſme; or elſe are yet upheld

by the ſtrength and might of authority, as it is with Turciſme. Now if it bee demanded why Iudaiſme hath taken ſuch deepe root in the hearts of the Hebrewes, as that it cannot thence bee eradicated? no better reaſon can be given or conceived than this; namely, that thoſe Iewes that are now alive did from their parents, and againe thoſe parents from their progenitors, and ſo upward untill the times of Moſes and Ioſhua, receive thoſe miracles mentioned in Scripture, by certaine and approved tradition; which miracles were done chiefly at the departing out of Aegypt, and in that iourney to Canaan, and in the entrance into that Holy Land, whereof their anceſtors were then eye-witneſſes. This in all probabilitie was the cauſe which moved that people, other whiles ſtiffe-necked enough, to

take upon them the yoke of the Law, ſo comberſome with rites and alſo that made wiſe men, inſtead of other notes of Religion which humane reaſon perhaps would haue thought more f

aſſiſtance of his holy Spirit, whereby we may be enabled for ſuch a worke, we ſhall endevour to make it appeare that Chriſtian Religion is the moſt true and certaine Religion of all the reſt, namely as followeth.

time after, whereunto the Chriſtians did ſometimes make their appeale. And further, neither did Iulian himſelfe, nor any other adverſaries of Chriſtianity ever make doubt hereof: So that hence it appeares, that there was never any more true and certaine ſtory than this; which (wee ſee) may be confirmed, not onely by the teſtimonies of ſome few men but alſo by the approbation of ſeverall nations otherwiſe diſagreeing and jarring among themſelves.

               SECT. V
               
                  The cauſe whereof was, for that in his life time there were miracles done by him.
               
               NOw among ſuch as profeſſed Chriſtianity there were many judicious &amp; learned men: For (to ſay nothing now of the Iewes) there was Sergius governour of Cyprus, Dionyſius Areopagita, Polycarpus, Iuſtinus, Irenaeus, Athenagoras, Origen, Tertullian, Clemens Alexandrinus,
                  
with divers others; who almoſt all being broughtup in other religions, neither could have any hopes of wealth or preferment in Chriſtianity, yet became worſhippers of this man that died ſo ignominious a death, and exhibited due honour to him as God: no other reaſon whereof can bee given than this that moved them ſo to doe; namely, becauſe they like prudent men in a matter of greateſt moment, by diligent inquiry found the truth and ground of that ſame which was bruted abroad concerning the miracles wrought by Chriſt; as the healing of many that were ſore diſeaſed with his word onely, the reſtoring of ſight to him that was borne blinde, the feeding of many thouſands with ſome few Loaves of bread, the reſtoring of ſome to life againe that were dead, and many other ſuch like wonderfull workes: The truth

whereof neither Celſus nor Iulian when they writ againſt Chriſtians durſt dare to deny: but it was confeſſed both by them, and alſo moſt plainly by the Hebrew doctors that were Authors of the Talmnd.
               
            
            
               SECT. VI.
               
                  Which miracles were not wrought either by the helpe of nature, or aſſiſtance of the devill; but meerely by the divine power of God.
               
               THat theft wondrous works were not wrought by any naturall power it is manifeſt, becauſe they were called wonders and miracles. For it is not poſſible in nature that any grievous diſeaſes and infirmities ſhould bee cured meerely by a mans voice, or by the vertue of a touch, and that even upon a ſuddaine.

And it is likely if ſuch works had beene done by the power of nature onely, then the ſame would have beene made knowne and revealed, either by thoſe that were profeſſed enemies of Chriſt while he lived upon earth, or by thoſe that have beene adverſaries of his Goſpell ſince his death.
               By the ſame argument wee may prove that ſuch workes came not to paſſe through the power and deceit of Sata
                        •
                     , or by any diabolicall enchantments, becauſe they were done openly in the ſight of all the people: amongſt whom divers of the learned ſort did maligne and

                  ear
                     •
                   ill will unto Chriſt, not without envy, obſerving all that hee did. Adde further, that the ſame workes were often iterated, and the effects thereof were not tranſitory but permaneant and durable. All which being duly pondered, it muſt needs follow (as

the Iewes have confeſſed) that theſe workes proceeded from a more than naturall or humane power, that is, from ſome good or evill Spirit. That they proceeded not from any evill Spirit may be proved, becauſe that the doctrine of Chriſt, (for the confirmation whereof theſe workes were wrought,) was quite oppoſite and contrary to bad Spirits. For it prohibits the worſhipping of evill Angels, and diſſwades men from all unclearneſſe of affections and manners, wherein ſuch Spirits are much delighted. And this is alſo plain, for that whereſoever the doctrine of the Goſpell is received and eſtabliſhed, there followes the ruine and downfall of Idols, the contempt and deteſtation of magicall arts, together with a ſerious hatred of all diabolicall worſhip, as being a thing contrary and repugnant to the worſhip

of the onely, true GOD.
               
               Neither is it, to bee thought that any wicked Spirit is ſo ignorant and fooliſh, as to effect and often bring to paſſe things that are cauſes of its owne hurt and diſgrace, and no way conducing to its honour or benefit. Beſides it ſtands no way with the wiſdome or goodneſſe of God himſelfe to ſuffer ſo harmeleſſe and innocent men, ſuch as feared him, to bee deceived by the deluſion of devils: and ſuch were the firſt followers of Chriſt, as is plaine by their innocent life, and by the many calamities which they endured for conſerence ſake.
               But on the other ſide, if thou affirme that thoſe workes of Chriſt proceeded from ſome good Spirits which are inferiour to God; in ſo ſaying thou doſt confeſſe that the ſame workes were well pleaſing unto God, and

did tend to the honour of his name; foraſmuch as good Spirits doe nothing but what is acceptable and glorious unto God. To ſay no more then, ſome of Chriſts works there were ſo miraculous, that they might ſeeme to have God himſelfe for the author of them, and could not have beene done but by the immediate finger of an omnipotent power, as ſpecially, the reſtoring divers perſons from death unto life againe.
               Now God doth not produce any miracle, nor ſuffer any ſuch wonders to bee wrought without juſt cauſe: For it becomes not a wiſe Law giver to forſake and depart from his owne lawes, unleſſe upon ſome good and weighty reaſon. Now no other cauſe of theſe things can bee given than that which was alleaged by Chriſt himſelfe, namely, that hereby his doctrine might

be verified and confirmed. And doubtleſſe they that were ſpectators of his workes, could conceive no other reaſon thereof: For ſince amongſt thoſe ſpectators and beholders of his miracles, there were (as was ſaid) many godly men, piou
                     •
                  ly and devoutly affected, it is horrible impiety to imagine, that God did worke theſe things onely to delude and deceive them. And this was one or the onely cauſe why very many of the Iewes who lived about the time of Ieſus, even ſuch as could not be perſwaded to relinquiſh or omit one jot of Moſes his Law, did acknowledge that this Ieſus was a Doctour or Maſter ſent from heaven.
            
            
               
               SECT. VII.
               
                  Chriſts reſurrection proved by credible reaſons.
               
               BEſides the miracles that Chriſt wrought to confirme his doctrine, another argument may be taken from his wonderfull reſurrection to life againe, after that he was crucified, dead, and buried;
               For the Chriſtians of all ages and Countries alleage the ſame, not onely for a truth, but alſo as the moſt ſtrong ſortreſſe and chiefeſt foundation of their faith; which could not be, unleſſe thoſe that firſt taught Chriſtianity, did perſwade their auditors that the thing was ſo for certain; And yet they could not induce any wiſe man to the beleefe hereof, unleſſe they could verily affirme, that themſelves were eye-witneſſes of this matter. For

without ſuch an ocular teſtimony no man of wiſdome and judgment would willingly give credit thereunto; ſpecially in ſuch perillous and dangerous times as then were. But that this was their conſtant aſſertion, both their owne bookes, and other writings doe teſtifie. For out of their bookes it appeares, that they appealed unto five hundred witneſſes that had beheld Ieſus after he was riſen from the dead. Now it is not the faſhion of lyars and diſſemblers to appeale to ſo great a number of witneſſes: Neither could it poſſibly ſo fall out that ſo many men ſhould agree and conſpire together to beare falſe witneſſe. Or ſuppoſe there had beene no other witneſſes, ſave thoſe twelve knowne Apoſtles, the firſt publiſhers of Chriſtian doctrine, yet this had beene ſufficient. No man is a leaſing-munger for God-a-mercy.

Any honour for their lying they could not expect, in regard that all kind of dignities and promotions did then belong unto the Pagans or Jewes, from whom they received nothing but reproach and ignominy. Neither could they hope for any wealth and commodity, becauſe this profeſſion was oftentimes puniſhed with the loſſe of goods and poſſeſſions: or if it was not; yet the Goſpell could not bee taught by them ſincerely, unleſſe they omitted or neglected all ſollicitous and anxious care for temporall commodity. Neither could the hope of any other worldly profit move them to fit or utter untruths; ſeeing that the very preaching of the Goſpell did expoſe them to labours, hunger, thirſt, ſtripes, and impriſonments.
               To get credit and reputation onely among their owne Country men was not ſo much worth

that they poore innocent men, (being ſuch as in their life and doctrine abhorred loſty mindedneſſe,) ſhould therefore run upon ſo great inconveniences. Neither againe could they have any hope for the propagation of their doctrine, w

               And further, this fame or reputation, whatſoever it was, was not likely to continue for ever; they could not promiſe to themſelves that it would be perpetual, ſeeing that God (purpoſely concealing his counſell concerning the end and deſtruction of the world) hath left the time thereof doubtfull, as being alwayes imminent at hand, which the writings of the Chriſtians that

lived in thoſe times, and of thoſe that ſucceeded thē do moſt plain

                  t this cannot juſtly bee laid againſt them, if the thing be rightly conſidered. For either they 
                     •
                  did ſincerely beleeve that this Religion which they profeſſed was the true Religion, or elſe they were of a contrary minde. If they did not beleeve it to bee true; nay if they thought not that it was abſolutely the beſt, they would never have made choice hereof, and refuſed other Religions farre more ſafe and cōmodious. Nay further, though they conceived it to bee moſt true, yet they would not have profeſſed it, unleſſe they had beene fully perſwaded, that the profeſſion there of was neceſſary; ſpecially, for that they might have eaſily foreſeene, and partly

they could tell by experience what troopes of men were expoſed to death for this profeſſion which without juſt cauſe to occaſion was no better than plaine robbery or murder.
               But if wee ſay, they beleeved that this Religion was moſt true and the very beſt, and altogether to be profeſſed, and that after the death of their Lord and Maſter: why ſurely, that could no way bee ſo, if their Maſters promiſe concerning his reſurrection had deceived them and not proved true. For that had beene enough to have un-faith't a ſound Chriſtian, and made the foundation of his hope to have tottered.
               Moreover, all ſorts of Religion, ſpecially Chriſtianity, altogether prohibits lying and bearing of falſe witneſſe in divine things: wherefore they could not for the love of Religion, principally ſuch a religion, be induced to tell

untruths. Beſides theſe men were of an upright converſation; their life was ſpotleſſe and unblameable even in the judgement of their adverſaries; and nothing could be objected againſt them, ſave their honeſt ſimplicity, which verely is not wont to uſe lying and diſſimulation. Nay, there were none among theſe primitive Chriſtians (whereof wee ſpeake,) who did not ſuffer grievous torments for profeſſing that Ieſus was riſen: and many of them were put unto moſt exquiſite paines of death for bearing teſtimony of the ſame. Now indeed it is poſſible for ſome man out of a wilfull pre-conceived opinion, to endure ſuch miſery; but it is utterly incredible and unlikely that any one, much leſſe ſo many ſhould bee willing to ſuffer ſo great calamity for beleeving an untruth; and that which they knew to bee ſuch an

untruth as the beleefe thereof could in no wiſe doe them any good.
               Beſides, that theſe were not mad men both their converſation and their writings doe abundantly teſtifie. Likewiſe what is ſpoken of them, may alſo be ſaid of Paul, who openly taught that hee ſaw Chriſt ſitting in heaven: who alſo was not inferiour to any in the Iewiſh Religion; nor might he have wanted dignities and preferments if hee would have followed the footſteps of his Fathers:
               
               Whereas on the contrary, by taking upon him the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, hee became liable to the hatred and malignity of his kinſ-folkes, and thereupon was to undertake hard labours, dangerous and toilſome travels, and laſt of all to undergoe a diſgracefull death and torment.

               IT is a moſt certaine truth, that either all kinde of divine worſhip whatſoever muſt be rejected and utterly baniſhed from among men, (which impiety will never enter into the heart of any one that can beleeve there is a God that governes all things; and with all conſiders how man is endued with excellency of underſtanding, and liberty to chuſe what is morally good or evill; as alſo how that in himſelf there is matter both of reward and puniſhment;) or elſe this Religion is to bee admitted and approved of for the very beſt: not only in regard of the outward teſtimonies of workes and miracles aforeſaid; but alſo in conſideration of ſuch inward and eſſential

properties as are agreeing thereunto: namely, becauſe there is not, neither ever was there any other Religion in the whole world, that can bee imagined more honourable for excellency of reward, more abſolute and perfect for precepts, or more admirable for the manner accordding to which it was commanded to bee propagated and divulged.

ſhall finde nothing there promiſed ſave the welfare and happineſſe of this life: as namely, a fruitful land, abundance of corne and victuall, victory over their enemies, ſoundneſſe of body, length of daies, the comfortable bleſſing of a hopefull iſſue, and ſurviving poſterity, and the like. For if there were any thing beſides, it was involved in darke ſhadowes, requiring a leare &amp; wiſe underſtanding for the right manifeſtation and diſcreet apprehenſion thereof: Which indeed was the cauſe why many (in particular the Sadduces, who profeſſed themſelves to bee followers and obſervers of Moſes his law,) had no hope of enjoying any happineſſe after this life.
               As for the Grecians, ſuch as received their learning from the Chaldeans and Aegyptians, what conceit or opinion ſoever they

                  , and againe from beaſts into men.
               But becauſe this opinion was not confirmed by any teſtimonies, or grounded upon certaine reaſon, (it being undeniable that there is ſome 
                     •
                  nd propoſed to mans actions,) therefore others were induced to thinke, that vertue was the end or reward of mens endevours▪ and that a wiſe man were

happy enough, even though hee were put into that tormenting braſen Bull made by Phalaris. Howbeit this fancy was juſtly diſtaſtefull and improbable to another ſort, who ſaw well enough that mans happineſſe and chiefeſt welfare could not conſiſt in any thing that included or was accompanied with perils, troubles, torment and death (unleſſe wee had rather follow the ſound of words than the ſenſe of things:) Wherefore they placed mans chiefeſt happineſſe in ſuch things as were delightfull and pleaſing to ſenſe. But yet this opinion alſo was diſproved and ſufficiently confuted by many, as being prejudiciall to all honeſty, the ſeeds whereof are rooted in our hearts by nature: as alſo becauſe it makes man, (who is borne to contemplate heaven and heavenly matters,) to be no better, if not worſe than a beaſt,
                  
that pores onely upon earthly things.
               With theſe and ſuch like uncertainties and doubtings was mankinde diſtracted at that time when Chriſt brought in the true knowledge of the right end: who promiſed unto his followers not only eternity without all ſorrow and tribulation, but alſo ſuch a life hereafter, as ſhall be accompliſhed with endleſſe joy and happineſſe: and that not of one part of man alone, to wit, of his ſoule, (the felicity whereof after this life, partly by probable conjecture, and partly from tradition, was hoped for before) but alſo of his whole body and ſoule together. For as the body by divine appointment becomes ſubject and liable to grievances, hurt, calamity, and vexation being united with the ſoule;

                  o likewiſe ought it to bee made jo ynt partaker of the recompence of

                  reward. Now the reward and promiſed joyes are not to bee thought of ſmall value or little worth, like to the meat, or good cheere and dainty fare wherewith the carnall Iewes ſeed their gaping hopes; or like to the ſleſhly voluptuouſnes of carnal copulation, which the Turkes expect to enjoy after death: for both theſe ſenſualities are proper to this fraile life, at the bell being but helpes or remedies of mortality, the former whereof conducing after ſome ſort for the preſervation of every particular man or beaſt in preſent being: and the latter for the continuation of the ſame creatures by ſucceſſion in their kinde. But by the happineſſe aforeſaid our bodies ſhalbe indued with conſtant vigour, agility, ſtrength, and more than a ſtarlike beauty. In the ſoule there ſhalbe an underſtanding without errour, a beholding

of God himſelfe and his divine providence, or whatſoever is now hid from us. The will ſhalbe freed from all turbulency of paſſions, buſied about nothing but the ſight, the admiring and praiſing of the Almighty. In a word there ſhal be joy and tranquillity, and all things, excellent beyond compare, ſuch as we cannot poſſibly conceive or apprehend in this mortall life.

All which being ſo; he that ſo carefully regards all kinds of bruit beaſts that none of them periſh, the ſame God with a more ſpeciall providence can alſo provide for humane bodyes,

Thus the Butterfly may be in a worme, and the ſubſtance of herbs or wine in ſome ſmall diminitive thing, whence they may bee re-reſtored to their former juſt magnitude and existence. Wherfore ſince all theſe things, and ſuch like are poſſible, there is no

cauſe why any ſhould thinke it impoſſible for humane bodies after death to be revived againe: foraſmuch alſo as divers learned men, to wit, Zoroaſter among the Chaldeans, Theopompus among the Peripatetik

                        〈◊〉
                      precepts given for the worſhip of God.
               
               THe ſecond thing wherein Chriſtian Religion excels all others that are, or ever were, or can be invented, is the great holineſſe of lawes and precepts, as well in matters pertaining to the worſhip of God, as likewiſe in things concerning our neighbour.
               
               
                  
The Pagans in their divine ſervice are given to more confidence and credulity than truth, as Porphyry ſhewes at large, and ſome late navigations have diſcovered. For with them it is a common received opinion, that the Gods may be appeaſed by the ſacrificing of mans bloud; which in humane cuſtome was not aboliſhed, either by the great learning of the Grecians, or by the lawes of the Romans, as appeares by thoſe oblations offered unto Bacchus and Iupiter. The hidden and moſt holy myſteries of the Goddeſſe Ceres, and of Father. Bacchus, being once lookt into &amp; revealed, were found to be full of all kinde of wantonneſſe and uncleanneſſe, as Clemens Alex. &amp; others have ſhowne at large. Thoſe Feſtivall dayes conſecrated to the honour of the Gods, were celebrated with ſuch ſolemnity of Pageants, and wanton

ſhewes, that grave Ca
                        •
                     o was a ſhamed to bee preſent at them. But in the Iewiſh Religion there was nothing unſeemely, nothing diſhoneſt or unlawfull. Howbeit to the end the people that were prone to Idolatry might not decline or fall backe from the ſame true religion, it was loaded and burdened with many precepts, even concerning ſuch things as in themſelves were neither good nor evill; ſuch were the ſacrificing of beaſts, the Circumciſion, an exact reſt from labour upon the Sabbath, and the prohibition of eating ſome kinde of meats; come of which cuſtomes the Turkes have borrowed from them; adding further a prohibition for drinking wine.
               But the Chriſtian Religion teacheth, that as God is a moſt pure Spirit, So is hee to be worſhipped with pureneſſe of minde and Spirit, together with ſuch

workes a
                     •…
                   their owne nature without a precept are moſt laudible and honeſt. Thus the profeſſors thereof are not to circumciſe the fleſh, but their carnall luſts and deſires: they are not to keep holi-day and refraine from all kinde of worke whatſoever, but onely from that which is unlawfull. Nor are wee to offe
                     •
                   unto God the bloud and fat of beaſts; but if need bee, even our owne blood for the teſtimony of the truth. And what bounty or liberality ſoever wee beſtow upon poore and neceſſito
                     •
                  s perſons, the ſame wee muſt thinke is given to God himſelfe. Wee need not now abſtaine from any kind of meat or drinke, but may and ought to uſe them both with moderation, ſo that our health bee not thereby impaired; ſometimes notwithſtanding ſubduing our bodies to our mindes by faſting, that the ſame thereby may

be the better fitted and prepared for more cheerefull devotion. But the chiefe point of this Religion conſiſts in a holy confidence, whereby wee doe wholly yeeld our ſelves in obedience unto God, and rely upon his promiſes by a ſtedfaſt and lively faith, whence ariſeth both hope and true love of God and our neighbour. And hereupon it is that we doe obſerve his Commandements, not after a ſervile manner for feare of puniſhment; but that wee may pleaſe him, and that hee may out of his goodneſſe be unto us a loving father and gracious rewarder.
               
               Moreover wee are taught to pray, not for riches or honours, or ſuch things as doe little good to any that wiſh for them: but in our prayers wee muſt firſt and and chiefely crave that which tends to Gods glory; then ſuch neceſſaries for our ſelves as are

requiſite to the ſuſtaining of nature, reſting upon Gods providence for temporall affaires, being not too much ſolicitous how the ſame ſhall fall out, but very carefull and deſirous of ſuch things as lead us to eternall life; and that by petitioning pardon for ſinnes by-paſt, together with the aſſiſtance of Gods holy Spirit, that we may be preſerved hereafter in the way of godlineſſe againſt all perils and temptations whatſoever.
               This is the true worſhip of God in Chriſtian religion, than the which nothing can be invented more honourable for the Almighty.

                  Concerning the offices of humanity which wee owe unto our neighbour.
               
               LIke to theſe are the duties we owe unto our neighbour. As for Mahumets Religion, it was hatcht in wars, it breaths nothing but warres, it is propagated by warres, and hoſtility. Ariſtotle condemnes the lawes &amp; ſtatutes of the Lace demonians, which were ſo much applauded among the Grecians, even by the Oracle of Apollo: Yet the ſame Ariſtotle allowes and approves of warre againſt the Barbarians for a thing naturall, whereas indeed the contrary rather is true, namely, that by nature there ought friendſhip and amity to be eſtabliſhed in all ſocieties of men. For what is more cruell than to delight in murder, or in a

bravery to vaunt and triumph in the ſlaughter of Nations, as in ſome glorious exploit? Yet ſuch was the cuſtome anciently amongſt the Romanes, that none was dignified with the title of any honour, unleſſe they had deſerved and purchaſed the ſame in warres, which notwithſtanding were apparantly unjuſt, as themſelves confeſſe of the wars againſt Sardinia and Ciprus. And indeed generally amongſt the heathen it was accounted no diſgrace, no crime or offence to pilfer and ſpoile thoſe that were not within their owne dominions, as wee finde it recorded by worthy Hiſtorians. Ariſtotle and Cicero made the deſire of revenging a part of vertue. It was a fine ſport and publike recreation for Pagans to behold ſwordplayers ſlaſh and wound one another: and to expoſe their children was an ordinary thing with

them: But the Hebrewes had better lawes and more holy diſcipline, though notwithſtanding they bare a mortall hatred aagainſt all thoſe that differed from them in opinion, as at this day appeares by their prayers that they make againſt us Chriſtians.
               
               And yet againe, their law ſuffered them to render like for like, and to have equall recompence for any hurt offered: and thereby any man was permitted in his owne perſon to kill, or bee revenged upon him that had ſlaine any one of his kindred. But the Commandement and law of Chriſt forbids us to revenge any kinde of injury whatſoever, whether it be offered in word or deed: that ſo we may not ſeeme to allow that wickedneſſe in our ſelves, which we condemne in others. Nay wee ought to bee ſo farre from malice, that on the

contrary wee muſt be kinde and well-affectioned unto all: not onely (though chiefly) to good men, but alſo to the very wicked, like to God our heavenly father, who makes the Sun and Starres, the aire and winds, the raine and other common benefits to deſcend upon all ſorts of men, good and bad.

               THe bond or unity of man &amp; wife, whereby mankind is propagated is a thing moſt holy and honorable by our law; which being neglected by the Pagan; is no marvell if they talkt of the whoredomes and adulteries of thoſe Gods they worſhipped, by whoſe examples they thought it not unlawfull for one man to have the filthy uſe of another, as

                   is reported of Ganymed and Antinous: which filthineſſe at this day is ordinarily practiſed among the Turkes, the Sinanſes and other Gentiles as a thing with them not unlawfull.
               The Philoſophers of Greece ſeeme to be a little more modeſt

                     •
                  urpitude and confuſion, there is, 
                     •
                  s it were, a kinde of wedlocke among the bruit beaſts. How much more requiſite is this league or bond for man ſo holy a creature, to the end there may not be a mingle mangle of iſſues, or the naturall and mutuall love of parents and children be utterly extinguiſhed?

The law of the Hebrewes prohibits all kind of uncleanneſſe, yet tolerates a man to have many wives, and in ſome caſes licenſeth the husband to put away his wife: which the Mahumitans at this day uſe to doe; like to the old Grecians and Lacine
                        •
                     , (yea, Cato himſelfe,) who were wont to lend their wives one to another for a ſeaſon.
               But the moſt perfect Law of Chriſt ſtrikes at the very root of this ſinne, that lies lurking in the heart of men; accounting him that onely caſts a want on eye upon a woman, to be guilty of committing adultery with her, at leaſt in thought, namely, before him that ſees and judges the hearts of al men. And becauſe all true friendſhip is and ought to bee conſtant and indiſſoluble, therefore by this law it is appointed that husband and wiſe be yoke-fellowes in a cohabitation

and union of bodies and minds; which doubtleſſe will be more convenient and behoofefull for the education of their children. The Germans, Romans, and ſome other people among the heathen were content with one wife onely. The Chriſtians alſo follow this cuſtome, to the end that loving affection betweene man and wife may bee mutually preſerued, together with a good ſucceſſe of affaires in domeſticall government vnder one head, that ſo many wives cauſe not ſtrife and contention amongſt their ſeverall children.

                  Touching the uſe of tēporal things.
               
               IN the next place let us come to the uſe of goods and temporall commodities, concerning which wee finde, that amongſt ſome heatheniſh Gentiles, to wit,

the Aegyptians and Lacedemonians, men were permitted to filch and ſteale. And herein they ſeemed not unlike the Romans of old for robbings and deprecations, of whom their Orator ſpake; ſaying, that if euery man had his owne, there were many that might lodge in poore cotages.
               Now the Hebrewes had no ſuch cuſtome; yet their Law, that it might ſeeme more eaſie, permitted them to take uſury of ſtrangers; amongſt other things promiſing the reward of riches
                     •
                  o them that obſerved the ſame law.
               
               But the Law of Chriſtianity forbids not onely all kinde of injuſtice, but alſo it prohibits us to take any carking and exceſſive care for theſe tranſitory things, becauſe our minde is not able diligently and duly to attend vnto two ſeverall matters, either of which were enough to take vp a whole man, and oftentimes

drives us into contrary thoughts and odde quandaries. Beſides, the exceſſive care both for getting and keeping riches is accompanied with a kind of bondage and anxiety, which blunts all the pleaſure and comfort that might ariſe from a moderate deſire and hope of commodity: And ſuch things as nature requires are not many or hard to be obtained, for nature is content with a little: yet if God beſtow any overplus upon us, ſo that wee have ſome what to ſpare, wee are not commanded to caſt the ſame into the Sea, as ſome Philoſophers unadviſed have done; neither muſt we keepe any thing unprofitably, or laviſh it out waſtfully; bur rather therewith wee ought to ſupply the wants and 
                     •
                  xigences of other men, either by giving, or by lending to them that would borrow: For thus it becomes us to thinke that we are

not Lords and Maſters of the things we enjoy, but as ſtewards and Diſpenſers under God Almighty, the Father and Maſter of all: knowing alſo that a benefit well beſtowed is a treaſureful of good hope, which neither the wickedneſſe of theeves, nor any caſualty can diminiſh.
               A rare example of this true and unfained liberality we finde in the primitive Chriſtians, who ſent releefe out of Macedonia and Achaiah to ſuccour them that lived in Paleſtine, as if the whole world had beene but one family. And here in the Law of Chriſt it is provided, that no hope of recompence or honour ſhould blemiſh and diſgrace our bounty, which would bee little ſet by in Gods ſight, if it were not wholly referred to his glory.
               And that no man may cloake his covetouſneſſe (as many uſe to doe,) by fearing they ſhall have

need of wealth when they are old, or that ſome miſchance may fall out which will drive them into poverty, therefore the Law promiſeth a ſpeciall care for ſuch as keepe the commandements: And that they may be the more animated and encouraged, they are put in minde of Gods providence in feeding the wild beaſts and cattell, in preſerving the graſſe &amp; flowers of the field. Now it were a ſhame for us, &amp; diſhonourable to ſo good &amp; powerfull a God, not to beleeve more than wee ſee or have a pawne for.

               THere are ſome lawes that forbid perjury, but this law of Chriſt will have us to refraine from all kind of ſwearing, unleſſe we be lawfully called thereunto upon neceſſity. Nay ſuch faithfulneſſe

and truth ſhould alwaies be in our words and actions, that there never needed any oath be exacted of us.

                  Of other matters.
               
               MOreover there can nothing bee found commendable and praiſe-worthy, either in the Philoſophicall writings of the Grecians, or in the ſayings of the Hebrewes and other nations, which is not either expreſly or vertually contained in the precepts of Chriſtianity, being eſtabliſhed by divine authority: as namely concerning modeſty, temperance, goodneſſe, honeſty, prudence, the office of Magiſtrates and ſubjects, Parents and children, Maſters and ſervants, man and wife betweene themſelves; and chiefly the eſchewing

thoſe vices which among many of the Grecians and Romans went vnder the name and colour of honeſty; ſuch were the deſires of honors and glory. And to be ſhort, admirable is the ſubſtantiall brevity of theſe precepts, namely comprehended in theſe few word, that we ought to love God above all things, and our neighbours as our ſelves, that is, wee muſt doe as wee would bee done unto.
            
            
               SECT. XIX.
               
                  Anſwer to an objection touching the controverſies abounding among Chriſtians.
               
               BVt here peradventure ſome will object againſt this which we ſpeake concerning the excellency of Chriſtianity, and tell us of the great diverſity of opinions amongſt Chriſtians, wherupon

there have ſprung ſo many ſects and factions as doe now abound in the Church.
               
               For anſwer whereunto, wee may obſerve that the like diverſity of opinions happens almoſt in all kinde of Arts and ſciences, to wit, partly through the weakneſſe of humane apprehenſion, and partly becauſe mans judgement is hindred and intangled with many imployments. Howbeit this variety of opinions is contained within certain bounds and limits: for there are ſome common principles whereof it is agreed upon by all, and whereupon they ground their doubts. Thus in Mathematicks 'tis queſtioned, whether a circle may bee made quadrangular; but not whether after the taking away of equal parts from equal, the reſidue wil not remaine equal. The ſame may bee ſeene in natura
                        •
                      Philoſophy, alſo in the art of Phyſicke,
                  
and in other diſciplines. In like manner the difference of opinions that is amongſt Chriſtians doth not hinder the common conſent and agreement in thoſe fundamentall principles, for which chiefly wee have commended Chriſtian Religion; the certainty whereof appeares in this, namely that thoſe which out of mutuall and deadly hatred ſought all the occaſion and matter of contention they could, durſt not for all that proceed ſo farre, as to deny that theſe precepts were commanded by Chriſt: no not even thoſe that refuſe to frame their lives and actions according to that rule.
               Howbeit if there be any ſuch as will contradict this that wee ſay, the ſame may bee likened to thoſe Philoſophers that denied the ſnow to be white: For as theſe are confuted by ſenſe, ſo are thoſe convinced by the unanimous

conſent of all Chriſtian nations, alſo by the many bookes that the firſt profeſſors of Chriſtian Religion, and they which followed, and divers ſucceeding Doctors have written: as alſo by the teſtimony of them that have witneſſed their faith in Chriſt by their death. For in the opinion of any indifferent Iudge the ſame muſt needs bee reputed the true doctrine of Chriſt, which ſo many haue ſucceſſively acknowledged and profeſſed, like as wee are perſwaded the ſame was the doctrine of Socrates which wee read in Plato and Xenophon; as alſo that of Zene the Philoſopher, which we find held by the Stoi ks.
               
            
            
               
               SECT. XX.
               
                  The excellency of Chriſtian Religion is further proved from the dignity of the author.
               
               THe third thing wherein wee ſaid Chriſtian Religion excelled all others that are, or can be thought of, was the manner whereby it was delivered and divulged. Where firſt wee ſhall ſpeake of the Author.
               
               They that were authors of the wiſdome among the Grecians, confeſſed that they could not alleage almoſt any certainties in their doctrine, becauſe (quoth they) truth lyes hid in a deepe pit; and our minds are no leſſe dazeled in the contemptation of divine things, than the eyes of an owle in beholding the bright ſhining of the Sunne: Beſides, there was none among them but was guilty of ſome vice: For ſome

were flatterers of Princes, others addicted to bawdery, and wantonneſſe, &amp; a third ſort to malapart boldneſſe. A great argument of a generall envy among them was their contention about words and matters of ſmall or no moment. In their devotions they were cold and heartleſſe: For thoſe that did beleeve there was one God, neglected his honour, and worſhipped ſuch things as they knew were no Gods; making that onely the rule of their Religion which was commonly received and practiſed in publike. Touching the reward of godlineſſe they determined nothing for certaine, as appeares by the laſt (farewell) diſputation of Socrates at his death.
               
                  Mahumet, another Author of another Religion farre diſperſed in theſe times, throughout his whole life was inclined to luſt, and ſenſuality, as his owne followers

cannot deny: neither did hee leave any teſtimony or aſſurance whereby his promiſe of ſuch a reward as conſiſted in the free vſe of junkets and venery, can appeare to bee true after his returne; ſince that his body is not yet revived, but remaines at Medina untill this day.
               But Moſes, the author of the Hebrew Law, was an excellent man; though not without his faults, as namely, when with ſome diſcontent and grumbling he ſo hardly tooke upon him the Ambaſſage which God commanded him touching the King of Egypt; conceiving alſo ſome diſtruſt of Gods promiſe for bringing water out of the rocke, as the Hebrews themſelves confeſſe: yet did he ſcarce partake of any one of thoſe promiſes which by the law he made unto the people, but was perplexed with continuall mut
                     •…
                  ies and ſeditions in

the wilderneſſe; neither was hee permitted to enter into that bleſſed and pleaſant land, ſo much deſired.
               But above all theſe, Chriſt is moſt honourable; in that neither his countrey-men, nor any other could ever convince him of ſinne. For whatſoever hee commanded others to obſerve, the ſame did he obſerve and performe himſelfe, and the Commandements that God gave him, he faithfully fulfilled, leading a moſt pure and upright courſe of life; being alſo moſt patient in ſuffering wrongs and abuſes, as was manifeſt at his death upon the croſſe; yea ſo affectionate was hee towards his very enemies, that he prayed God to pardon even thoſe that put him to death.
               As for the reward which hee promiſed unto his Diſciples, wee verily beleeve that himſelfe is made partaker therof after a moſt

eminent and excellent manner. For after hee was riſen from the lead there were many that beheld, and heard, and ſaw him: who alſo aſcended up into heauen in the ſight of his twelve diſciples; where he obtained all power, as was evident in that according to his promiſe made at his departure hee endued them that were his followers with the gift of tongues and other admirable vertues: all which may be a ſure warrant for us not to doubt either of the truth or poſſibility of the reward which hee hath promiſed. And thus wee have ſhowne how that this Religion is more excellent than others in regard that Chriſt the author of it hath himſelfe performed what hee commanded; as alſo in his owne perſon obtained, and already enioyeth the happineſſe that he promiſed.

                  arge extent.

within the ſpace of thirty yeeres, or thereabouts, was publiſhed not onely thorowout all the parts of the Roman Empire, but alſo among the Parthians and remote Indians.

Their manner and kinde of death alſo was not ordinary, but ſome were burned quicke, others nailed upon croſſes, and racked; moſt of them put to ſuch grievous torments as cannot bee read or conceived without horrour and wonder. And this ſavage cruelty againſt Chriſtians, which continued in the Roman world and elſe where, (ſcarce with any intermiſſion,) untill the time of Conſtantine, did not ſo depopulate the Church, but that out of the ſeed thereof, (the blood of the Martyrs,) there ſprang up ever a new ſupply of Profeſſors.
               
               Now if herein wee compare Chriſtianity with other Religious, wee ſhall finde that amongſt the Grecians and other Pagans, though they were wont to magnifie

their owne Worthies above meaſure, yet is there but a ſhort Catalogue of ſuch as ſuffered death for the teſtimony of their doctrine: onely we reade of certaine Philoſophers in India, of Socrates alſo and ſome few more: who no doubt, being the moſt eminent men in thoſe times, had a deſire to perpetuate their fame to poſterity. But amongſt thoſe Chriſtians that ſuffered martyrdom
                        •
                     
                   for their faith, there were very many of meane ranke, being of the common ſort of people, ſuch as were ſcarce ever taken notice of or knowne to their neighbours that lived hard by. There were women alſo, wives, virgins, and young men; ſuch as (it is probable), never covered or hoped for any renowne in their ſufferings: wherupon in the books of martyrs we finde the names but of a few in cōpariſon of the whole number of thoſe that were put to

death, and the reſt onely regiſtred in groſſe.
               
               Adde further that the heathen for the moſt part under any ſlight pretence, as the caſting of ſome frankincenſe upon the Altar, could free themſelves from the paine of ſuch a death and ſo couzen the world, but this can in no wiſe be ſaid of thoſe, who (whatever they thought in their hearts) dealt plainly in their deeds and accommodated themſelves to the nature and condition of the vulgar. And ſuch were the Iewes and Chriſtians, who alone can be ſaid to have undergone death for the honour of God. Neither can wee attribute this praiſe and commendation to any Iewes after the times of Chriſt who alſo before Chriſt came ſhort of that great number of Chriſtians that in one onely Province were perſecuted for the Goſpell of Chriſt the greateſt ſuffering of the Iewes being onely

               Wherefore ſeeing that Chriſtianity ſo farre excels all other Religions in this particular, it may juſtly thereupon be preferred before all others. And ſeeing likewiſe that ſo great a multitude of men of every ranke and degree, thorowout all ages and places have not feared to ſuffer death for this Religion, wee muſt needs conceive there was ſome notable ground or cauſe of ſuch their conſtancy, which could bee nothing ſave the plaine evidence of truth together with the holy Spirit of God.

                  Anſwer to them that require more forcible reaſons.
               
               FInally if any yet be not ſatiſfied with theſe arguments aboveſaid,

but deſire more forcible reaſons for confirmation of the excellency of Chriſtian Religion; let ſuch know that as there are variety of things which be true, ſo are there divers wayes of proving or manifeſting the truth. Thus is there one way in Mathematicks, another in Phyſicks, a third in Ethicks, and laſtly another kinde when a mater of fact is in queſtio
                     ••
                   wherein verily wee muſt reſt content with ſuch teſtimonies as are free from all ſuſpition of untruth; otherwiſe downe goes all the frame and uſe of hiſtory, and a great part of the art of Phyſicke together with all dutifulneſſe that ought to be betweene parents and children: for matters of practic
                        •
                     
                   can no way elſe be knowne but by ſuch teſtimonies. Now it is the pleaſure of Almighty God that thoſe things which he would haue us to beleeve (ſo that the very beleefe thereof may bee imputed to us for

obedience) ſhould not ſo evidently appeare, as thoſe things which are apprehended by ſenſe and plaine demonſtration but only be ſo farre forth revealed as may beget faith, and a perſwaſion thereof in the hearts and minds of ſuch as are not obſtinate: That ſo the Goſpell may be as a touchſtine for triall of mens judgements, whether they be ſound or unſound. For ſeeing theſe arguments, whereof wee have ſpoken, have induced ſo many honeſt, godly, and wiſe men to approve of this Religion, it is thereby plaine enough that the fault of other mens infidelity is not for want of ſufficient teſtimony, but becauſe they would not have that to bee had and embraced for truth which is contrary to their wilfull deſires; it being a hard matter for them to relinquiſh their honours, and ſet at naught other commodities; which thing they know they ought to doe, if they admit of Chriſts doctrine and obey

what hee hath commanded. And this is the rather to bee noted of them, for that many other hiſtoricall narrations are approved by them to bee true, which notwithſtanding are onely manifeſt by authority, and not by any ſuch ſtrong proofes, and perſwaſions, or tokens, as doe declare the hiſtory of Chriſt to bee true: which are evident partly by the confeſſion of thoſe Iowes that are yet alive; and partly in thoſe companies and congregations of Chriſtians which are any where to bee found; whereof doubtleſſe there was ſome cauſe.
               Laſtly, ſeeing the long duration or continuance of Chriſtian Religion, and the large oxtent thereof can bee aſcribed to no humane power, therefore the ſame muſt bee attributed to miracles: or if any deny that it came to paſſe through a miraculous manner; this very

getting ſo great ſtrength and power without a miracle, may bee thought to ſurpaſſe any miracle.
               
            
         
         
            
            
            The third Booke OF THE TRVNESSE OF Chriſtian Religion.
            
               SECT. I.
               
                  To prove the authority of the books of the new covenant.
               
               
                  AFter that a man is once perſwaded by the reaſons aboveſaid, or is induced by any other arguments to beleeve that this ſame Religion which Chriſtians profeſſe is the trueſt, and abſolutely the beſt;
                  
if hee deſire more diſtinctly to know the parts thereof, then muſt hee have recourſe unto the moſt ancient writings that containe the ſame Religion, and which commonly wee call the bookes of the new Teſtament or new covenant.
               
               This truth no man can juſtly deny: for as every ſect, bee they good or bad, ſhould be beleeved when they tell us truly in what booke or writing their opinions are compriſed: thus wee credit the Turkes who affirme that the Religion of Mahumet is contained in the Alcoran; So it muſt be granted that the doctrine of Chriſtianity is contained in the ſaid bookes of the new covenant, ſince the ſame is generally agreed upon, and conſtantly ave red by all Chriſtians.
               
               Foraſmuch then as wee have before proved that this Religion is moſt true; if there were no other

ground, yet this alone were ſufficient to prove and avouch the authority of thoſe bookes aforeſaid, wherein the ſame Religion is contained.
               Which truth to demonſtrate more particularly, let us in the firſt place take for granted by all indifferent men that he who goes about to diſprove the authority of any booke or writing which hath bin a long time received and allowed of, muſt uſe ſuch arguments as doe derogate from the truth of that booke: Otherwiſe the authority thereof is no whit diminiſhed, but may ſtill bee defended and maintained.
            
            
               
               SECT. II.
               
                  Here is ſhowne that ſuch bookes were written by the Authors whoſe names they have prefixed.
               
               WEE ſay then that thoſe bookes which are not in queſtion amongſt Chriſtians, but have certaine titles, are the very workes of thoſe authors whoſe names they beare; to wit, becauſe thoſe primitive fathers, Iuſtin, Iraeneus, Clemens, and others doe commend thoſe bookes under the ſame Authors names; as alſo be cauſe Tertullian witneſſeth that there were Orignall copies of thoſe bookes extant in his time And beſides all the Churches received thoſe bookes for authenticall before there were any common publike meetings. Neither did ever the Pagans or Iews make doubt thereof, but Iudian himſelfe

plainly confeſſeth that thoſe were the writing of Peter and Paul, Matthew, Marke, and Luke which Chriſtians under thoſe names have read and received. For as no man can doubt that thoſe writings which goe under the names of Homer and Virgill are truly theirs, becauſe the one hath beene ſo long time received among the Latins, and the other among the Greeke authors: in like manner, it were more abſurd to bring the authors of thoſe bookes in queſtion which are granted almoſt by all the nations in the world.
            
            
               SECT. III.
               
                  Some bookes were anciently doubted of.
               
               IN the volume of the new Covenant, there are ſome bookes now received, which were not ſo

received from the beginning, as namely the one Epiſtle of Peter, that of Iames and Iude, two of Iohn the Presbiter, the Revelation and the Epistle to the Hebrewes; which, though not in all, yet were ſtill allowed by moſt Churches, as is very probable, in that the ancient Chriſtians did alleage divers teſtimonies out of them as being ſacred and holy. And it is likely too that ſuch Churches as from the beginning had not thoſe bookes, either were ignorant of them or doubtfull. Yet afterward when they were better informed touching the ſame, they admitted them into the Canen (as we now ſee) according to the example of other Churches.
               
               Neither can any good reaſon be given why wee ſhould thinke them to be ſuppoſititious and counterfeit writings; for there is nothing compriſed in them, neither can ought thence bee collected

which is not abundantly expreſſed in other Bookes unqueſtioned.
            
            
               SECT. IIII.
               
                  The authority of ſuch bookes as have no titles is proved from the quality of the writers.
               
               ANd here let no man miſtruſt the verity of the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, becauſe the writer of it is unknowne; nor doubt of the two Epiſtles of Iohn and the Revelation, becauſe ſome men doe queſtion, whether the author of them was Iohn the Apoſtle, or ſome other of that name? For the name is not ſo much to bee regarded as the quality or condition of the writers Hence it is that we receive many bookes of hiſtory, whoſe authors are to us unknowne; As that concerning the Alexandrian war

by Ceſar: becauſe wee may perceive that he whoſoever writ the ſame, lived in thoſe times, ad was preſent when the things were done. In like manner it ought to ſuffice us that whoſoever wrote the bookes wee ſpeake of, both lived in the primitive age and were endued with Apoſtolicall gifts. For he ſpeakes very improbably that ſaith, theſe qualities were but counterfeit, and that other writings might beare the names of theſe authors; who every where preſſing truth and prety cannot bee thought to play the 
                     •…
                  ning Sophiſters and be guilty of falſhood, a thing not onely odious among all good men, but by the Roman lawes was to bee puniſhed with death.
            
            
               
               SECT. V.
               
                  Theſe pen-men writ the truth, becauſe they had certaine knowledge of what they writ.
               
               THus it being plaine that the bookes of the new covenant were written by thoſe authors, whoſe names they beare, or by ſuch as beare witneſſe of themſelves; if wee adde further that they know well the matters where of they wrote to be true, and had no purpoſe to lye or diſſemble, it wil follow that the things which they committed to writing were both certaine and true, becauſe every untruth proceeds either from ignorance, or from a wicked deſire to deceive.
               As touching Matthew, Iohn, Peter and Iohu, they were all of the ſociety and fellowſhip of thoſe twelve whom Ieſus did chuſe to bee witneſſes of his life and doctrine;
                  
ſo that they could not be ignorant of thoſe things which they did relate. The ſame may be ſaid of Iames, who was either an Apoſtle, or as ſome thinke, the next a kin to Ieſus, and by the Apoſtles conſecrated Biſhop of Hieruſalem. Paul alſo could not erre through lacke of knowledge, either about thoſe points which hee profeſſeth were revealed to him by Ieſus himſelfe triumphing in heaven; orabout the things that were done by him, having Luke a follow companion with him in his journeyes. This Luke might eaſily know the certainty of thoſe things which hee writ concerning the life and death of Ieſus: For hee was borne and bred in the places next adjoining to Paleſtina; through which countrey when he travelled, hee ſaith hee ſpeake with ſuch perſons as were eyewitneſſes of the things that were done. For doubtleſſe

beſides the Apoſtles with whom hee had familiarity, there lived many others at that time who had beene cured by Ieſus, whom they ſaw both before his death and after his reſurrection.
               If wee will give credit to Tacitus and Suetoni
                        •…
                     
                   in thoſe things which happened a long time before they were borne, becauſe we are confident that they diligently enquired into the truth thereof; how much more ought wee to beleeve this writer, who ſaith that hee reeived all the things which hee relates from them that had ſeene the ſame.
               It is credibly reported of Mark that hee was a daily companion with Peter, ſo that whatſoever he writ may bee thought as ſuggeſted or witneſſed by Peter, who could not bee ignorant thereof. Beſides, the ſame things that hee writes are almoſt all extant in the Acts of the Apoſtles. Neither

could the author of the apocalyps bee deceived or deluded in thoſe viſions, which hee ſaith were revealed to him from heaven. No more could he that writ the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes erre in thoſe things which hee profeſſeth, either to bee inſpired into him by the Spirit of God, or elſe taught him by the Apoſtles.
               
            
            
               SECT. VI.
               
                  As alſo becauſe they would not lye.
               
               THe other reaſon we ſpake of to prove the truth of the ſaid holy writers, was becauſe they had no will or deſire to tell an untruth: And this hath beene toucht before in generall, when wee proved the truth of Chriſtian Religion, and of the hiſtory of the reſurrection of Chriſt.
               
               Thoſe that will accuſe any witneſſes for the pravity of their

                  will, muſt produce ſuch proofes and evidences as may probably make it appeare why the will ſhould be diverted from uttering the truth: but this cannot bee averred of the ſaid authors. For if any doe object and ſay that they ſpake for their owne advantage, upon enquiry it will appeare that they ſought after no ſuch by-end, having neither hope of getting commodity, or of eſchewing any danger; but rather by their profeſſion they were more likely to loſe all their commodities and be liable unto all ſorts of perils. If they aimed at any advantage, it was onely to gaine honour unto God, which doubtleſſe cannot bee compatible with lying and diſſembling, ſpecially in ſuch a buſineſſe as whereon depends the everlaſting ſalvation of mankinde: Farre be it then from any man to thinke that they were guilty of ſo great impiety, their doctrine being

ful of all ſanctity, and their lift exemplary for innocency and integrity, free from the accuſation of their greateſt adverſaries; who onely condemned them for lacke of knowledge, a fault unlikely to be the mother of falſhood. No, if they had beene guilty of never ſo little fraud or deceit in that kind, ſurely they would not have recorded to poſterity their owne treſpaſſes, as namely, their forſaking of Chriſt when hee was in danger, and Poters deniall of him three times.
            
            
               SECT. VII.
               
                  A confirmation of the ſidelity of theſe authors from the miracles which they wrought.
               
               ON the other ſide God himſelfe gave teſtimony of their fidelity by working wonders which both they and their Diſciples

with great boldneſſe publikely avouched, adding alſo the names of the perſons; places and other circumſtan
                     •
                  es: So that the truth or falſhood of their aſſertion might eaſily have beene diſcovered by the inquiſition of the Magiſtrate.
               
               More particularly, among the wonders that they wrought, wee may note (as moſt ſenſible and certain) the uſe of tongues among ſo many thouſands which never learned them; and their curing the diſeaſes of the body upon a ſuddaine in the ſight of the people. Neither were they any whit diſmaied with feare either of the Iewiſh Magiſtrates of thoſe times whom they knew to bee moſt maliciouſly ſet againſt them; or of the Romans, who dealt very unjuſtly with them, omitting no fit occaſion that might bee matter for traducing or accuſing them as inventors of a new Religion:
                  
Nay, the very Iewes or Pagans, in the times immediately following, durſt never deny, that wonders were wrought by thoſe men For ſo much is confeſſed of Peters miracles by Phlegon in his Annals, who lived under Adrian the Emperour. Moreover the Chriſtians themſelves in thoſe bookes that contained a reaſon of their faith, which they exhibited to the Emperours, to the Senate, and to the governours, doe relate theſe things as moſt manifeſt and unqueſtionable truths, yea they openly report that there continued a wonderful vertue of working ſtrange effects at their Sepulchers for certaine ages after their death; which if it had beene falſe, they knew that to their ſhame and puniſhment the Magiſtrates could have confuted the ſame: and this that wee have ſpoken may ſuffice concerning the authors.
               
            
            
               
               SECT. VIII.
               
                  The truth of the writings connirmed by the events that have come to paſſe accordingly as they were revealed.
               
               THere are other reaſons to prove the truth and ſidelity of theſe authors writings. For many things are therein f

               For ſo it was foretold that this Religion ſhould upon a ſudden have a large and ample increaſe; that it ſhould continue for ever; &amp; thought it were rejected by moſt of the Iewes, yet ſhould it be imbraced by the Gentiles that were ſtrangers to it. Thus likewiſe was

                  foretold what hatred &amp; ſpight the Iewes would beare againſt them that profeſſed this religion, &amp; what grievous perſecutions the profeſſors thereof ſhould undergoe: Alſo what a great ſiege and deſtruction there ſhould be both of Hieruſalem that great City, and of the Temple, together with a miſerable calamity among the Iewes.
               
            
            
               SECT. IX.
               
                  As alſo from Gods care in preſerving his people from falſe writings.
               
               BEſides this, if it bee granted that God out of his providence carefully reſpects and governes humane affaires, ſpecially ſuch as belong to his honour and worſhip; then it cannot bee that he ſhould ſuffer ſo great a multitude to bee cheated and deceived with lying bookes; thoſe men I

meane, whoſe full intent and purpoſe was to worſhip God after a holy manner. And foraſmuch as among ſo many ſects that have ſprung up in Chriſtianity there hath not beene one that received not either all or the moſt of thoſe bookes, excepting ſome few that containe no ſingular matter above the reſt; this mee thinkes may be a great argument that no materiall thing could bee objected againſt theſe writings; ſpecially ſince the ſaid ſects were ſo partiall and ſpitefully bent againſt another, that what one approved of, another commonly would bee diſpleaſed therewith, even becauſe the ſame was liked of by others.

                  Anſwer to the objection that divers bookes were not received by all.
               
               INdeed there were ſome that deſired to be Chriſtians, who notwithſtanding refuſed to admit of ſuch bookes as they did perceive contained any thing that made againſt their doctrine. And theſe were either ſuch as out of hatred againſt the Iewes ſpake ill of their law, and rev
                     •
                  led the God of the Iewes who was the makes and framer of the whole world; or elſe they were ſuch as feared the great afflictions and perſecutions that Chriſtians ſuffered; And thereupon thought it the ſafeſt way to 
                     
                        •
                     urke under the name of Iewes, who had free liberty for the exerciſe of their Religion. Howbeit theſe lurkers were rejected and forſaken by all

the open profeſſed Chriſtians that lived in thoſe times, when as all that any way diſagreed in opinion (if they kept unity of affection and piety) might have beene ſuffered with great patience according to the Apoſtles commandement. As for the former kinde of theſe baſtard or counterfeit Chriſtians, I thinke they have beene ſufficiently confuted both by that which wee have ſaid before when wee proved that there was but one only true God, the ſole framer of the whole world: As alſo by thoſe very bookes, which that they might have ſome ſemblance of Chriſtians they did admit of, ſpecially the Goſpell of Luke; wherein is evidently ſhowne that the ſame God whom Moſes and the Hebrewes worſhipped was preached by Chriſt. And the other ſort we ſhall more fitly confute when we ſpeak againſt thoſe that both are and would bee called

                  Iewes. For the preſent onely this I ſay, that it is great impudency in them to fleight and extenuate the authority of Paul, ſeeing verily there was not one of all the Apoſtles, that expounded and taught more Charches than hee did: who was reported at that time to have wrought many miracles, when (as ere while wee ſaid) there might eaſily have been triall, and inquiry made of the truth of the matter. If then it bee true that hee wrought wenders, why may wee not beleeve him concerning his heavenly viſions and inſtruction received from Chriſt himſelfe, to whom ſince he was ſo deately beloved, it cannot be that hee ſhould teach any thing inglorious or ingratefull unto Chriſt, as falſities or untruths would have beene. And as touching that particular whereof they accuſe him, namely his doctrine of the liberty and freedome

which was purchaſed for the Hebrewes from thoſe rites and ceremonies that were formerly commanded them by Moſes there was not any cauſe in regard of himſelfe why he ſhould ſpeak any thing but truth therein: For both hee was circumciſed and of his owne accord hee did obſerve the moſt part of the law: But for Chriſtian Religions ſake, he was both to doe and ſuffer more difficult matters, than either was commanded by the law, or could happen by occaſion of the Law. He taught alſo that his Diſciples ſhould doe and ſuffer the like: whence it appeares that hee uttered no flattering or enricing ſpeeches unto his auditors; who were taught in ſtead of the Sabbeth, to keepe every day holy for divine worſhip, and in ſtead of the little expences which the law required to ſuffer the loſſe of all their goods, and in ſtead of the bloud
                  
beaſts to conſecrate their owne blood unto God. And further Paul himſelfe plainly affirmes that Peter, Iohn, and Iames, in token of their conſent with him, gave him the right hands of fellowſhip: which hee never durſt have ſpoken, if it had not beene true, becauſe the ſame men being then alive might have convicted him for a lyar.
               But to leave theſe men that ſearce deſerve the name of Chriſtians, beſides this which we have now ſaid concerning the miracles, wrought by the ſacred pen men aforeſaid, and concerning the ſingular providence of God about affaires of this kinde; the manifeſt conſent and agreement of all other Chriſtian congregations in the receiving of theſe bookes may induce any inidifferent men to give credit thereunto: ſpecially conſidering that they are wont commonly to credit other books

of hiſtory, without any ſuch teſtimonies, unleſſe they ſee ſome plaine reaſon to the contrary, which cannot bee ſaid of any of thoſe bookes whereof wee have ſpoken.
            
            
               SECT. XI.
               
                  Anſwer to an objection that theſe bookes ſeeme to containe things impoſſible.
               
               FOr if any doe object ſaying that divers things are there in related which ſeeme to be impoſſible ever to have come to paſſe: wee anſwer as before hath beene intimated that there are ſome things impoſſible for man to doe, which not withſtanding are poſſible unto God, ſuch as include in them no contradiction or contrariety. And of this ſort are thoſe wonderfull effects which wee moſt of all admire, as the raiſing
                  
of the dead unto life againe, and therefore that objection is of no force.

                  Or things contrary to reaſon.
               
               NEither are they to be regarded and aſſented unto who ſay that ſome doctrines are compriſed in theſe bookes which are diſagreeing to right reaſon: For ſuch are confuted firſt by the practice of ſo many learned, grave, judicious and wiſe nien as have allowed and admitted of theſe bookes for authenticall ever ſince the primitive times: Then by that which wee have before declared in the firſt booke to be conſonant to right reaſon; as namely, that there is a God, who alone is abſolutely perfect and infinite in vertue, life, wiſdome, and goodneſſe, of whom all things that have any

being were made: whoſe care and providence reacheth over all his workes, eſpecially unto men; and who can after this life bountifully reward all them that obey him.
               Beſides there is ſhowne how that all the luſts of the fleſh are to be bridled and ſubdued: that amongſt men there is kinred and alliance, and therfore they ought to love one another with ſincere affection: All which are moſt plainely ſet downe in the ſaid bookes of the new covenant. Now we know how unſafe it is for any to affirme any thing beſide this, peremptorily to be true, either concerning the nature of God or his will; ſpecially if it bee grounded onely upon humane reaſon: And further we may gueſle how uncertaine it would bee both by the jarring opinions of the ſchoolmen among themſelves, as alſo by the contrary concluſions of the Philoſophers.
                  
And it is no marvell: for if men doe ſo farte diſagree in their opinions touching their owne ſoule, then they muſt needs much more diſſent when they goe about to determine any thing not revealed concerning the higheſt mind, and the moſt ſupreme Spirit which ſo farre tranſcends our weak appiehenſion. Or if (as prudent men do think) the inquiry into the Councels of Kings bee dangerous and not to, bee attempted or attained by us; who then is there ſo wiſe and prudent that hopes hee ſhall ever bee able to underſtand the will of God concerning thoſe things which he hath reſerved in his owne freedome and ſecret councell: Wherefore Plato ſaid very well, that none of theſe hidden myſteries could bee knowne without an Oracle. Now there can no Oracle be proved to be an Oracle indeed by any clearer teſtimonies than thoſe that are contained

in the ſaid bookes of the new covenant. Contrary to which bookes it is neither proved, nor ſo much as affirmed by any that God ever publiſhed any thing concerning his nature and eſſence Neither is there extant any letter Revelation or other ſignification of his will that can bee beleeved for true. For if there were any thing otherwiſe commanded or permitted before Chriſts time, which in it ſelfe was indifferent, that is neither due nor diſhoneſt, yet the ſame is not repugnant to the ſaid writings fince that in ſuch matters of indifferency the last law or commandement that is given doth aboliſh and annull the former.
               
            
            
               
               SECT. XIII.
               
                  Anſwer to an objection that ſome of theſe bookes are repugnant to the other.
               
               SOme doe further object that in theſe bookes there is ſome diverſity of ſenſes and interpretations. But for anſwer whoſoever will but duly ponder this matter he ſhall finde the ſame to be another argument beſides the ſome to juſtifie the authority of the ſaid bookes, namely becauſe they doe moſt manifeſtly and apparently agree about ſuch things as concerne any point of doctrine or hiſtory: Which conſent and accord cannot elſe-where bee found among any other writers that are of one and the ſame ſect or profeſſion, whether wee conſider the Iewes or the Greeke Philoſophess, the Phyſitians or the Roman Lawyers. All which doe not only differ
                  
much among themſelves, yea even thoſe that are of the ſame ſect as Plato and Xenophon; but oftentimes one ſhal find the ſame writer to affirme now one thing, then another, as if he were forgetful of himſelfe, or knew not what to reſolve upon. But theſe other writers, to wit, the holy penmen, of whom wee ſpeake, doe inculcate and expreſſe the ſame points of faith: they deliver the ſame commandements; and as for their narration of the life, and death, and reſurrection of Chriſt, the Summe and ſubſtance in them all is the very ſame.
               As touching ſome particular circumſtances, ſuch as are of ſmal or no moment, happily they might be well reconciled, though perhaps the manner how bee unknowne; namely, becauſe of the ſimilitude of things that were done at divers times, or for the doubtfull ſignification of ſome

words, or by reaſon of the ſeverall names and appellations of this man or that place and the like. Nay this (me thinkes) may bees motive to vindicate and free theſe writers from all ſuſpicion of falſehood, it being uſuall with thoſe that would have lyes and untruths credited, to relate all circumſtances ſo ſtreight and trimly as there ſhal not appeare any colour or ſhew of difference. Or if it be ſo, that for any ſmal difference which cannot eaſily bee reconciled a whole booke ſhall loſe its credit; then I trow wee muſt beleeve no bookes at all, ſpecially thoſe oſ hiſtory: yet wee ſee that Polibius, Halicarnaſſenſis, Levy and Plutarch, for the ſubſtance o
                     •
                   them are eſteemed authenticall and true, though in ſome circumſtances they ſeeme to bee faulty: Therefore it were unequall that ſacred writers ſhould loſe then credit for one or two ſeeming

ſlips, (if there were any in their writings) who ſo ſeriouſly deſired and earneſtly indevoured to expreſſe both truth and piety therein.
            
            
               SECT. XIIII.
               
                  Anſwer to an objection taken from outward teſtimonies, which make more for theſe bookes.
               
               ANother way of confirming what wee have ſaid; Some thinke may bee by alleaging the contrary teſtimonies of thoſe that were ſtrangers to the covenant of promiſe.
               But I dare boldly ſay that there are no ſuch teſtimonies to be found, unleſſe a man wil produce the ſayings of them that were borne a long time after, who did openly proſeſſe emnity againſt Chriſtianity, and therefore could be no fit witneſſes for this matter.
               
                  
Nay, on the contrary, if need were, we could alleage many teſtimonies to confirme divers parts of the hiſtory which is delivered in the ſaid bookes. Thus both Hebrewes and Pagans report that Ieſus was crucified, and that ſundry miracles were done by him and his Diſciples. Thoſe knowne bookes of Ioſephus, which were written about forty yeeres after Chriſts aſcenſion, doe make mention of Herod, Pilat, Feſtus, Felix, Iohn the Baptiſt, Gamliel, and of the deſtruction of Hieruſalem at large. Herewith all agree that which the Authors of the Talmud have recorded concerning thoſe times. Tacitus relates how cruelly Nero uſed the Chriſtians. And anciently there were certain bookes extant, not only of private men, as of Phlegon and others; but alſo ſome publike Acts, wherunto the Chriſtians appealed, namely, for that in them there

was mention made of the ſtar that appeared at Chriſts birth and manifeſted his nativity unto the wiſe

               SECT. XV.
               
                  Anſwer to the objection that the ſcriptures were changed.
               
               NOw what can be ſaid more againſt theſe bookes? Surely I ſee nothing that can bee objected, unleſſe it bee ſaid that they remained not altogether the ſame that they were from the beginning. And indeed it may be granted that what is common to other bookes might happen to thoſe, namely that by the careleſneſſe or corupt dealing of the tranſcribers, ſome letters, ſillables or words might bee changed, left

out o
                     •
                   added. But it is an unjuſt thing to bring in queſtion the truth of ſuch a booke or evidence onely becauſe in ſo many ages there could 
                     ••
                  e but he great variety of Copies, ſince both cuſtome and reaſon tels us that what is agreed upon by the greater number and moſt ancient copies, the ſame is to be preferre before the contrary. Now that all the copies of theſe bookes were corrupted by guile or otherwiſe, either in points of doctrine or matter of hiſtory it will never bee proved, there being no evidences or teſtimonies of former times ever to evince the ſame. But if (as we ſaid before) there be any thing urged by thoſe that bare ſo great hatred againſt the writers or followers and maintainers of theſe bookes the ſame is to bee held for a reproach or calumny, and not for any good proofe or ſufficient teſtimony againſt them. And this

which we have ſaid might ſuffice in anſwer to thoſe that tell us the ſcripture hath beene changed; which whoſoever affirme, ought to make good their aſſertion againſt the ſcripture ſo long time received in the Church.
               
               But that the vanity of this objection may more plainely appeare, wee will ſhew that what they imagine to bee true, neither did nor ever could co
                     •
                  e to paſſe. We have proved before that the books which have any titles were written by the Authors whoſe names they beare, which being granted, it will follow that one booke was not forged or put into the place of another: neither is there any notable or noted part changed therein.
               For in ſuch a mutation there would have beene ſome ayme or intent whereby that part might have eaſily beene diſtinguiſhed from other parts and bookes not changed or altered, which cannot

now any where bee diſcerued Nay (as wee ſaid) there is every where a conſent and harmony of the ſeaſe and meaning herein, as it admirable to conſider.

not onely by particular men, but by the comon care and diligence of whole Churches. Adde further that theſe bookes in the following

               Beſides wee have the writings of thoſe men who were taught by the Apoſtles themſelves, or by their Diſciples, wherein many places of ſcripture are cited out of theſe bookes to the ſame ſenſe &amp; meaning, which now we read thē. Neither was there any in the Church of ſo great authority at thoſe times who could have bin ſuffered to falſifie or change any thing if he would, as is plaine by the open diſſent of Iraeneus, Tertullian, and Cyprian from thoſe that were moſt eminent in the Church. After theſe times there

Neither was there ever any ſect that had the liberty at their pleaſure alter any of theſe bookes for their owne turns, in aſmuch as it is manifeſt that all of them did ground and aſſume arguments one againſt another out of the ſame. And as for that which wee

touched concerning divine providence, the ſame belongs no leſſe unto the chiefeſt parts than unto the whole bookes; namely, that it cannot conveniently be ſaid that God would ſuffer ſo many men which ſincerely deſired to bee godly and earneſtly ſought after eternall life, to bee led head long into that error which they could no way avoyd. And thus much ſhall ſuffice to bee ſpoken for the authority of the bookes of the new covenant, whence alone if there were no other helps, wee might be ſufficiently inſtructed concerning the true Religion.
               
            
            
               SECT. XVI.
               
                  For the authority of the bookes of the old Teſtament.
               
               NOw foraſmuch as it hath pleaſed God to leave us the writings and evidences of the Iewiſh

Religion, which was anciently the trueſt, and affoards divers teſtimontes for Chriſtianity; Therefore it will not be amiſſe, in the next place, to juſtifie the authority of the ſame. Firſt then that theſe bookes were written by the ſame men, whoſe names they beare is manifeſt in like manner as wee have proved of ours before, of the new covenant.
               
               Theſe authors were either Prophets, or other very faithfull and credible men, ſuch as was Eſdras, who compiled the bookes of the old Teſtament into one volume, during the life time of the Prophet Haggai, Malachy, and Zachary. I will not here repeat againe what is ſaid before in the commendation of Moſes. Both that part of history which at firſt was delivered by him, as wee have ſhowne in the firſt booke: and that alſo which was collected after his time is witneſſed even by

many of the heathen. Thus the Annals of the Ph

Hee whom Ieremy cals Vaphres King of Aegypt, is termed Apries by Herodotus. In like manner the bookes of the Grecians are repleniſhed with narrations concerning Cyrus and his ſucceſſors until the times of Darius. And many other things concerning the na

                        •
                     : whereunto wee may adde what before wee have touched out of Strabo and Trogus. But as for us Chriſtians we are not to queſtion the truth of thoſe bookes, out of which we borow many teſtimonies. Neither doe wee finde when Chriſt reprehended many things

in the Doctors of the Law and Phariſies of his time that ever he accuſed them of falſhood committed againſt the writings of Moſes or the Prophets; or that they had altered or uſed any forged bookes.
               Then after Chriſts time, it cannot be proved, neither is it credible that the ſcripture was corrupted in matters of any moment; ſpecially if wee conſider that the ſame books were preſerved ſafely by the Iewes, which people was diſperſed farre and wide over the face of the earth. For firſt of all the ten tribes were led a way captive by the Aſſyrians into Media then afterward the two other tribes: And after that Cyrus granted thē leave to returne, many of them went and dwelt in forraine Countries.

Adde moreover that almoſt three hundred yeeres before Chriſt at the appointment and care of the Kings of Egypt, thoſe bookes of the Hebrewes were tranſlated into the Greeke tongue by thoſe that are called the Seventy interpreters So as then the Grecians had the ſenſe and ſubſtance of them,

though in another language; whereby it appeares to be more unlikely that they were any where changed. Nay more theſe bookes were tranſlated both into the Chalde

               Then began Chriſtian Religion to bee more and more propagated,

being profeſſed by many of the Hebrewes, and by ſundry perſons that had learned the Hebrew tongue; who if the Iewes had uſed any Legerdemaine in any notable part, could thereupon quickly diſcover the ſame by comparing more ancient Copies▪
                   and ſo have made it publikely knowne. But they are ſo farre from doing this that on the other ſide they alleage many teſtimonies out of the old covenant to the ſame ſenſe and meaning that they are uſed by the Hebrewes: which Hebrewes may ſooner bee accuſed of any other fault, then falſhood or negligence about theſe bookes, which they have ſo religiouſly and exactly deſcribed and compared that they know how often any one letter is ſound therein.
               The laſt though not the leaſt argument to prove that the Iewes did not purpoſely corrupt or alter
                  
the ſcripture, may be becauſe the Chriſtians out of the very bookes which are read by the Iewes doe evince, and as they imagine, ſtrongly prove, that their Lord and Maſter, Ieſus is that ſame very Meſſias which was anciently promiſed to the Iewes their forefathers: which doubtleſſe they would have beene carefull might not have beene done; ſpecially when the controverſie aroſe betweene them and the Chriſtians, if ever it had been in their power to have changed what they liſted.

                  MAny men there are, who beholding the great perill and jeoperdy that other people are in, doe much joy and hug themſelves if they bee out of gun-ſhot and free from all ſuch danger.
               
                  
But Chriſtianity teacheth another leſſon, ſpecially in points of doctrine; and therefore in this fourth booke it ſhall appeare, that one chiefe duty of a Chriſtian in this life is, not onely to rejoyce and content himſelfe with the finding out of truth; but alſo to lend his helping hand to others that wander in the labyrinths of errors, and make them partakers of ſo good a benefit. This after ſome ſort we have indevoured to doe in the former bookes; for the demonſtration of truth implies the confutation of errour. Yet in regard all kinds of Religions that are oppoſite to Chriſtianity, to wit, Paganiſme, Iudaiſme, and Mahumeta

deſiring our readers to purge their minds from partiality and all impediments of judging aright that ſo they may the better conceive the truth we are to ſpeake.
            
            
               SECT. II.
               
                  And firſt of Paganiſme, that there is but one God. Created Spirits are good or bad: the good not to be honoured, but in reference to God.
               
               TO begin then againſt Pagans If they ſay that there are divers eternall and coequall Gods, wee haue conſuted this opinion before in the firſt booke, where wee taught that there is but onely one God, who is the cauſe of all things. Or if they by the name of Gods, doe underſtand the created Spirits which are ſuperior to men they then either meane the good or the bad: if they ſay the good,
                  
firſt they ought to bee well aſſured that ſuch are ſo indeed, otherwiſe they commit a dangerous ertor in receiving enemies inſtead of friends and traitors for Ambaſſadors. Then it were but reaſon they put an evident difference betweene the worſhip of God and theſe Spirits: As likewiſe to know what hierarchy and order there is among them; what benefit may be expected from any of them; and what honour by Gods permiſſion or appointment is to bee exhibited to them. All which, ſince they have not poſitively ſet downe in their Religion it is plaine how uncertaine the ſame Religion is, and how it were a ſafer courſe for them to betake themſelves to the worſhip of one Almighty God, which even Plat
                        •
                     
                   confeſſed was the duty of every wiſe man, ſpecially for that to whomſoever God is propitious and favourable, to them theſe

                  Angels muſt bee ſerviceable and gracious, being indeed miniſtring Spirits of the Almighty.

                        •
                      Spirits adored by Pagans, and how impious a thing it is.
               
               BVt it was the bad not the good Spirits which the Pagans did worſhip, as may bee proved by ſundry reaſons: firſt becauſe theſe adored Angels did not referre their worſhippers unto the ſervice of the true God, but as much as in them lay they laboured to aboliſh the ſame, or at leaſt in every reſpect they required equall honour with the Almighty. Secondly, becauſe they wrought all the harme they could againſt the worſhippers of the true God by provoking both Magiſtrates and people to moleſt them. For when it was lawfull for Poets to ſing of

the murders and adulteries committed by the Gods, and for the Epicures to take away all divine Providence, and for any other Religion (though never ſo different in ceremonies) to be allowed as was the Egyptian, the Phrygian the Grecian, and the Thuſcan at Rome; Even then generally the Iewes were only made ridiculous as appeares by Satyrs and Epigrames written upon them; who ſometimes alſo ſuffered haniſhment. And as for Chriſtians they were afflicted with moſt bitter puniſhments: no other cauſe whereof can bee given than that both theſe ſects did worſhip one true God, whoſe honour was impeached by the multitude of ſuch Gods as the heathen adored.
               Thirdly, this was manifeſt by the maner of their worſhip, which no way eſcemed any good and honeſt ghoſt; namely by humane bloud, by the running of naked

               Nay, which is more, both anciently there were and now there are ſome people that know and profeſſe▪ that theſe are wicked ghoſts whom they worſhip. Thus the Perſians adored Pluto, the Grecians honoured devils, the Romans worſhipped a hurtfull God that hee might doe them no harme: divers of the Ethiopians and Indians doe the like; then the which nothing can be invented more impious and abominable. For what is true religious worſhip but a teſtimony of an infinite goodneſſe, that a man doth acknowledge to be in him whom he worſhippeth? which if it bee exhibited unto a bad Spirit, it is falſe and counter feit, implying in

it no leſſe crime than high treaſon for aſmuch as the honour due unto the King is not onely de

                  ogated from him, but is conferd upon his enemy, a traiterous rebell. Moreover, vaine is that perſwaſi on which they conceive of God, that he is good, and therefore will not puniſh this offence, becauſe they thinke ſo to doe were contrary to his goodneſſe. For mercy or clemency that it may bee juſt, is bounded with limit: and where wickedneſſe abounds there juſtice doth as it were neceſſarily require the infliction of puniſhment Neither are they excuſed for ſaying they are induced to obey ſuch wicked Spirits out of a certaine feare or awe of them, ſeeing that God, as hee is the chiefe good, ſo is he communicative and imparts his goodneſſe in the production of other natures: which if it bee true, then i

power and dominion over all thoſe other creatures as over his workmanſhip, ſo that nothing can bee, done by any of them, which he hath a deſire to hinder. All which being granted, (as it is moſt certaine,) then we may eaſily collect that whoſoever is in the ſpeciall favour of God can bee ſubject to no further harme by evill Spirits, then the Almighty will ſuffer ſhall turne to his good.
               
               And laſtly there can nothing be obtained of bad Angels which is worth the accepting of, but rather worthy to be abhorred and deſpiſed: For when a devill diſſembles and playes the hypocrite, then is hee the worſt of all; and the gifts of an enemy are uſually nothing but crafty fetches and meere deceit.

Next ſucceeds honour whereunto ſome Temples were dedicated, and this is nothing but a good opinion of ſome men concerning ſuch perſons as they imagine are endued with vertue: And herein men may eaſily erre in honouring bad men in ſtead of good. Since then none of all theſe are ſubſtances, and conſequently not comparable to the dignity of ſuch things as have ſubſiſtence, neither can they bee ſaid to have any notice of our prayers or worſhip; therefore to reverence them for Gods is a thing moſt abſurd and unreaſonable, ſeeing that for theſe things he is to be worſhipped who can both give and preſerve the ſame.

                     us were skilful, as it is recorded by many. I deny not but that greater things than theſe might be ſeen, which though they tranſcended naturall cauſes, and mans power and ability, yet needed they not any divine omnipotent hand▪ but the Spirits placed betweene God and man might ſuffice for the production thereof: Which Spirits by their agility and ſubtilty might eaſily convey from one place to another, things diſperſed, and worke ſuch ſtrange effects upon them, as would affect men with aſtoniſhment and wonder. But the ghoſts whereby any ſuch matter is effected, are no good Spirits, and conſequently this Religion cannot be good, as is manifeſt by that which hath beene ſaid before, and likewiſe in that which they tell us of certain charmes and inchanting verſes,

whereby they are compelled thereunto where as not withſtanding the wiſer ſort of the heathen themſelves coufeſſe that there can be no ſuch efficacy in the bare words; which have onely ſome power of perſwaſion, and that no otherwiſe than by way of ſignification. Beſides this is a ſigne of their wickednes, that by ſome vain promiſe or villanous act, they did undertake to intice one contrarily affected to love and like another, which thing is prohibited by humane lawes as being a kind of ſorcery. Neither need any man wonder why God ſuffered ſome marvels to bee wrought by evill Spirits among the Gentiles, ſeeing they deſerved to be cheated with ſuch illuſions, which ſo long time had forſaken the worſhip of the true God.
               
               Moreover this is an argument of their weakneſſe and impotency that their workes were never accompanied

with any good thing: For if any were ſeene or ſeemed to bee revived, yet they did not continue alive, neither could they exerciſe the functions of living creatures. Or if it happened that any thing proceeding happily from a divine power, did appeare to the Pagans; yet the ſame was not fore told ſhould come to paſſe for the confirmation of their Religion, and therefore there might be other cauſes, beſt knowne to God, of the event thereof. As for example, if it was true that Veſpaſian reſtored ſight to one blinde; this was done that he being therby made more honourable, might the more eaſily obtaine the Romane Empire. For he was appointed by God to be a Miniſter of his judgements in the behalfe of the Iewes: more ſuch like cauſes there may bee of other wonders, which had no relation at all to their Religion.

               THe very ſame likewiſe in a manner may ſerve for anſwer to that which they object concerning Oracles, particularly wee may re-ſay, that theſe men did worthily deſerve to be deluded for contempt of that knowledge which reaſon or ancient tradition ſuggeſted to each of them Then againe the words of the Oracles for the moſt part were ambiguous, and according to divers events might admit of divers interpretations. Or if there was any thing more expreſly foretold by them, yet it is not neceſſary that the ſame ſhould proceed from an all-knowing minde: For it was either ſuch a thing as might bee foreſeene by naturall cauſes then exiſting, as Phyſitians can foretell ſome future diſeaſes: or elſe

ſome probable and true conjecture might bee made by that which commonly fals out and uſually comes to paſſe, as we reade of ſome perſons we

So in the ſame Sibyls it is ſaid that he was to be acknowledged for a King, who ſhould be our King indeed, and ſhould come out of the Eaſt, and have dominion over all. Wee read in Porphyry
                  
of the Oracle of Apollo, which ſaith that other Gods are onely Aery Spirits, but the God of the Hebrewes is only to be worſhipped: which ſaying if the worſhippers of Apollo had obeyed, then they had left off being his Diſciples: If they did not, then they made their God a lyar. Adde further, if thoſe Spirits had reſpected or intended the good of man-kinde, above all they would have preſcribed ſome courſe of life to bee obſerved, and alſo promiſed ſome aſſurance of reward to them that live accordingly; neither of which was ever done by them.
               On the other ſide oftentimes in their verſes wee finde ſome Kings commonded which were wicked men, ſome champions extold and dignified with divine honour, others allured to immodeſt and unlawfull love, or to the receiving of filthy lucre, and committing

of murder, as might bee ſhewne by many examples.

               BEſides all that hath hitherto beene ſaid, Paganiſme it ſelfe miniſters to us a notable argument againſt it ſelfe; namely becauſe that whereſoever the ſame becomes deſtitute of humane help, there ſtraight way it comes to ruine, as if the foundation thereof were quite overthrowne. For if wee behold all the Kingdomes and ſtates that are among Chriſtians or Mahumetans, wee ſhall finde no mention of Paganiſme, but in bookes. Nay the hiſtories of former times do ſhew that when the Emperours went about to uphold their Religion either by violence

and perſecution, as did the firſt of them; or by learning and ſubtilty, as did Iulian; yet notwithſtanding it decayed daily, not by any violent oppoſition, nor by the brightneſſe and ſplendor of Chriſtianity, (for Jeſus was accounted by the common ſort onely a Carpenters ſonne;) nor by the flouriſh of learning, which they that taught the law of Chriſt uſed not; nor by gifts &amp; rewards, for they were poore; nor by any ſoothing and ſlattering ſpeeches, for on the contrary they taught that all worldly cō
                  modity muſt be deſpiſed, &amp; that all kind of adverſity muſt be undergone for the Goſpels ſake. See then how weake and impotent Paganiſme was, which by ſuch meanes came to ruine.
               Neither did the doctrine of Chriſt onely make the credulity of the Gentils to vaniſh, but even bad Spirits came out of divers

bodies at the name of Chriſt: they became dumbe alſo, and being demanded the reaſon of their ſilence, they were compelled to ſay, that they were able to do nothing where the name of Chriſt was called upon.

                  Anſwer to the opinion of ſome that thinke the beginning and decay of Religions depend upon the efficacy of the ſtarres.
               
               THere were ſome Philoſophers that did aſcribe the beginning and decay of every Religion unto the ſtarres: But that which they profeſſe themſelves to know there in is taught with ſuch variety and diverſity in their Star-gazing ſcience, that a man can collect nothing from thence for certainty, but onely this that there is no certainty at all therein.
               
                  
I doe not here ſpeake of ſuch effects as have a neceſſary dependance upon naturall cauſes, but of thoſe that proceed from the will of man, which of it ſelfe hath ſuch liberty and freedome that no neceſſity or violence can be incident thereunto from without. For if the aſſent or conſent of the will did neceſſarily follow any outward impreſſion, then the power in our ſoule which wee may perceive it hath to conſult and deliberate, were given in vain: Alſo the equity of all lawes, of all rewards and puniſhments would be aboliſhed, ſeeing there can bee neither fault nor merit in that which is altogether neceſſary and inevitable.
               Againe, there are divers evill acts or effects of the will, which if they proceeded of any neceſſity from the heavens, then the ſame heavens and celeſtiall bodies muſt needs receive ſuch efficacy

from God, &amp; ſo it would follow, that God, who is moſt perfectly good, were the prime cauſe of that which is morally evill; And ſeeing that in his law he proſeſſeth himſelfe to abhor wickedneſſe, which if hee implanted in the things themſelves by ſuch inevi
                        •
                     able power, then hee might bee ſaid to will two contraries, to wit, that the ſame thing ſhould bee done and not bee done: alſo a man ſhould offend in any action hee did, by divine inſtigation.
               
               They ſpeake more probably that ſay the influences of the ſtars doe firſt affect the ayre, then our bodies, with ſuch qualities as often times doe excite and ſtirre up in the minde ſome deſires or affections anſwerable thereunto: and the will being allured or inticed by theſe motions doth oftentimes yeeld thereunto: which though it be granted, as it is credible, for truth, yet it makes nothing

for the queſtion wee havein hand. For ſeeing that Chriſtian Religion moſt of all with drawes men from thoſe things which are pleaſing unto the body, it cannot therfore have its beginning from the aſſections of the body, and conſequently not from the influence of the ſtarres; which (as but now we ſaid) have no power over the minde, otherwiſe than by the med

               LAſtly, this is an evidence which makes much againſt the Pagans, ſo that they have little or nothing to object againſt Chriſtian Religion: namely, becauſe all the parts thereof are of

ſuch honeſty and integrity, that by their plaineneſſe and perſpicuity they doe as it were convince the minds of the heathens themſelves, among whom divers did teach the ſame truths which generally our Religion admits of for ſound and orthodox: As to give ſome inſtances; true Religion conſiſts not in rites and ceremonies, but in the worſhip of the minde and Spirit: hee is an adulterer that hath but onely a deſire to commit adultery: wee ought not to revenge injuries: A man may bee the husband of one wife onely: And the league or bond of Matrimony ought to bee conſtant and perpetuall: man is bound to doe good unto all, ſpecially to them that are in want: we muſt refraine from Swearing as much as may bee: And as for our food and apparell wee ought to content our

ſelves with ſo much as will ſuffice nature, and the like. Or if happily there bee ſome points in Chriſtianity not altogether ſo credible, yet the like alſo is found amongſt the wiſeſt of the heathen themſelves, as before wee have ſhewne concerning the immortality of ſoules, and of the reſurrection of bodies. Thus Plate as hee learned from the Chaldeans, diſtinguiſhed the divine nature into the Father, and the minde of the Father; which hee cals both the Councell and branch of God, who is the maker of the world; as alſo the Soule or Spirit which preſerveth all things.

               To conclude, Plato in the ſecond book of his common wealth as if hee had beene a Prophet, ſaith for a man to become truly juſt and upright, it is requiſite that his vertue bee bereaved of all outward ornaments, and that hee be by others accounted a wicked wretch, and ſcoffed at, and laſt of all hanged.

And indeed that Chriſt might be the patterne of greateſt patience, it could no otherwiſe come to paſſe.

Of this nation ſprang our Meſſias, and the firſt Doctors of Chriſtianity: they are the tree wherinto we are ingraffed: they are the keepers of Gods Oracles, which we doe reverēce aſmuch as they, even making ſighs unto God for them, &amp; praying that the day may quickly come, when the vaile being taken away which hangs over their faces, they with us ſhall ſee the fulfilling of the law; And when (as it is in their Prophecies) every one of us ſhal lay hold on the Cloake of the Hebrew man, deſiring

that we may together with a holy conſent worſhip the onely true God, who is the God of Abraham, Iſaac and Iacob.

it is the confeſſion of the authors of the Talmud, and other Iewes themſelves, that ſtrange unders were wrought by Chriſt, which may ſuffice for this particular. Neither could God any way more effectually gaine authority unto his doctrine which was publiſhed by man, than by the working of miracles.

               THeſe miracles of Chriſt, ſome ſay, were done by the helpe of Devils. But this calumny hath beene confuted before, when we ſhewed that whereſoever the doctrine of Chriſt was taught and knowne, there all power of the Devils vaniſhed away. Others reply that Ieſus learned Magicke arts in Egypt: but this

ſlander hath no more, nay not ſo much colour of truth then the like accuſation by the Pagans framed againſt Moſes, whereof wee reade in Pliny and Apuleius.
               
               For, that ever Ieſus was in Egypt cannot be proved ſave only out of the writings of his Diſciples: who adde further that he was an Infant when he returned thence. But it is certain by other proofes that Moſes lived the moſt part of his youth in Aegypt. Howbeit the law aſwell of Moſes, as of Chriſt frees them both from this crime, plainly forbidding ſuch arts as being abominable in the ſight of God. And without all queſtion, if in the time of Chriſt and his Diſciples, there had beene either in Egypt, or any where elſe any ſuch Magicall art, whereby men might have beene enabled to doe the like marvels as are related of Chriſt; to wit, the curing of the

                  ſpeechleſſe, the healing of the lame, the giving ſight to the blind, then would Tyberius, Nero, and other Emperors have had notice therof, who ſpared no coſts and charges in the inquiry after ſuch like things.
               Nay, if it were true which the Iewes relate, how that the Se

                   of the great Councell were child in Magicke arts that they might convince them that were guilty of that iniquity; then ſurely, they being ſo mightily incenſed againſt Ieſus, as they were, and envying the honour and reſpect which hee obtained by his miracles, would either themſelves have done the like workes by the ſame art, or by ſufficient reaſons would have made it appeare, that the workes of Chriſt proceeded from no other cauſe.

                  lye, which certaine of the Iewes have invented concerning the miracles done by Chriſt, namely in that they aſcribe the ſame unto a myſticall unknowne name, which (as they ſay) being placed in the Temple by Salomon, was to be preſerved ſafe by two lions, during the ſpace of one thouſand yeares and more, afterward was ſtolne away by Ieſus. For there is no mention made of thoſe lyons either in the books of Kings and Chronicles, or by Ioſephus: nor was there any ſuch thing found by the Romans, who accompanying Pompey, entred into that Temple, before the times of Ieſus.

                  The miracles of Ieſus were divine, becauſe hee taught the worſhip of one God the maker of the world.
               
               IT being then granted as the Iewes cannot deny, that wonders were wrought by Chriſt, by the very law of Moſes it will follow that he muſt be beleeved. F

                     hould bee raiſed up of God, to whom the people ſhould be obedient, or otherwiſe become liable to grievous puniſhments. Now miracles are the moſt infallible markes of the Prophets, than the which, more certaine notes cannot be imagined. But in Deuteron. 13. it is ſaid, that if any profeſſing himſelfe to be a Prophet and doth worke wonders, yet the ſame muſt not be beleeved if hee goe about

to entice the people to a new worſhip of the Gods. For, though ſuch miracles bee done by him, yet this is onely by Gods permiſſion for triall, whether the people would perſiſt conſtantly in the worſhip of the true God. From which places compared together the Hebrew interpreters do rightly collect that every one muſt be beleeved that worketh miracles, unleſſe thereby hee intice men from the worſhip of the true God; and in that caſe only miracles are not to bee credited, though in ſhew moſt glorious. Now Ieſus did not onely prohibit the worſhipping of falſe Gods, but alſo expreſly condemned it as a moſt grievous crime, and taught us to reverence the writings both of Moſes and the Prophets that ſucceeded him. Wherefore there is nothing that can bee objected againſt the miracles that were wrought by Chriſt.
               
            
            
               
               SECT. VI.
               
                  Anſwer to the objection taken from the difference betweene the Law of Moſes and of Chriſt, where is ſhowne that a more perfect law than that of Moſes might be given.
               
               AS touching that which ſome alleage concerning the difference betweene the law of Moſes and the law of Chriſt, it ſeemes but of ſmall moment. For the Hebrew Doctors themſelves make this rule, namely, that by the authority of a Prophet who worketh miracles, any precept whatſoever may bee violated and tranſgreſſed, except that onely which concernes the worſhip of the true God. And ſurely that power of making lawes, which belonged unto God when hee gave the commandements by the hand of Moſes, went not from him: Neither can

any man that of his owne power makes lawes bee thereby hundred from making the contrary.
               That which they object of Gods immutability is nothing: for wee ſpeake not here of Gods nature and eſſence, but of his works. Light is changed into darkneſſe, youth into old age, ſummer into winter, and all by the worke of God. This God at the beginning gave Adam leave in Paradiſe to eat of other apples, but he forbad him to eat of the fruit of one tree: Why? even becauſe it ſo pleaſed him. Generally hee prohibited men to commit murder, yet he commanded Abraham to kill his ſonne. One while hee forbad to offer ſacrifices apart from the Tabernacle, another while he admitted of them. Neither will it follow, becauſe the Law which was given by Moſes was good, therefore no better could bee given. Parents are wont to babble

and prattle with infants, to wink at the vices of their childhood, and entice them to learne with an apple or a butter-lep: But ſo ſoone as they come to riper age, their ſpeech is amended, the precepts of vertue are taught them by degrees, and they learne what is the goodneſſe and benefit of honeſty. Now it is plaine that the precepts of that law of Moſes were not exactly perfect, becauſe many▪ 
                  holy men of thoſe times, lod a more holy life than thoſ commandements required. Thus Moſes who ſuffered the revenge of a wrong to bee exacted partly by blowes, and partly by ſentence, himſelfe being vexed with moſt bitter injuries, became an interceſſor for his enemies. So David willing to have his rebellious Sonne to be ſpared, did patiently endure reproachfull ſpeeches caſt upon himſelfe. We finde not that any good men left their wives,
                  
which notwithſtanding was permitted by the law. The reaſon of all this chiefly is, becauſe thoſe lawes were accommodated to the greater part of that people: therefore in the ſtate and condition they were in, it was meet ſomething ſhould bee kept had and reſerved, which afterward might be perfected, when God by a greater efficacy of the Spirit was to chuſe unto himſelfe a peculiar people out of all nations. Yea, all the rewards which are expreſly promiſed by the law of Moſes, belong onely to this mortall life: wherefore it muſt bee granted, that there might ſome better law be given, whereby the reward of eternall happineſſe ſhould be promiſed, not under any ſhadowes, but in plaine and expreſſe termes: which we ſee is done by the law of Chriſt.
               
            
            
               
               SECT. VII.
               
                  The law of Moſes was obſerved by Ieſus, who aboliſhed 
                        •
                     o commandements that were eſſentially good.
               
               ANd here by the way, for the conviction of the Iewes it muſt be noted, that thoſe Iewes who lived in Chriſts time, uſed him moſt baſely, and puniſhed him moſt ſeverely; when as yet there could no juſt accuſation bee laid againſt him for tranſgreſſing the law. He was circumciſed; hee uſed the ſame food and apparell that the Iews uſed: thoſe that were healed of lepers hee ſent unto the Prieſts: The Paſſeover and other feſtivall dayes he religiouſly obſerved: Though he did cure ſome upon the Sabbath day: yet hee ſhewed both by the law and by the common received opinions that ſuch works were not unlawfull to be done upon the Sabbath

day; And then chiefly began he to publiſh the abrogation of ſome lawes, when after his triumphover death he aſcēded into heaven, adorning his Diſciples upon earth with gracious gifts of the holy Spirit, whereby he made it evident that hee had obtained a regall power, wch includes the authority of making a law: And that according to Daniels prophecie, ch. 3. &amp; 7. compared with chap. 8. &amp; 11. where he foretold, how that a little after the deſtruction of the Kingdomes of Syria and Aegypt (the latter whereof happened in the raigne of Auguſtus,) God would give the kingdome to a man, which ſhould ſeem but ſimple and neceſſitous, to a people choſen out of all nations and languages, which Kingdome ſhould never have an end.
               Now that part of the law, the neceſſity whereof was taken away by, Chriſt, contained nothing that

was honeſt in 
                     ••
                  s owne nature: but conſiſted of things that were indifferent in themſelves, and conſequently not immutable. For i
                     •
                   the ſame things had had in them any neceſſary ground why they ſhould have beene done; then would God have preſcribed them not to one, but to all the people; and not after that man-kinde had lived above the ſpace of two thouſand yeares, but even from the beginning of all. Neither Abel, Enoch, Noah, Me'ch
                        •
                     ſedeck Iob, Abxuham, Iſaac, or Iacob, (though all of them were godly men, and dearly be loved of God) knew this part of the Law, but were altogether ignorant or very little acquainted there with; yet notwithſtanding for all that, they received the teſtimony of their confidence in God, and of Gods love unto them. Beſides, neither did Moſes exhort Iethro his father in law to the receiving of

theſe rites, nor did Ionah, the Ninivites, neither did any other Prophets reprehend the Chaldeans, Aegyptians, Sydonians, Tyrians, Idumeans, &amp; M
                        •
                     abites, for not admitting thoſe ceremonies, though when they writ unto them, they reckoned up their ſinnes exactly enough. Theſe then were peculiar precepts given either for the eſchewing of ſome evill, which the Iewes were prone unto, or for the triall of their obedience, or for the ſignification of ſome future things.
               
               Wherefore it is no more to be wondred that theſe are aboliſhed, than if any King ſhould abrogate ſome Municipall ſtatutes, to the end hee might eſtabliſh one law within his dominions. Neither can there any reaſon be alleaged, to prove that God did ſo binde himſelfe, as that he would change nothing of the ſame.
               For if it be ſaid, that theſe precepts are perpetuall, the ſame word
                  
men oftentimes uſe, when they would ſignifie that that which they command is not yearely or for a certaine time, ſuppoſe in the time of warre, peace or famine. Yet they are not thereby hindred from making new conſtitutions of the ſame things, ſpecially when the publike good requires the ſame. Thus in like manner ſome lawes given to the Hebrews were onely temporary, during the peoples abode in the wilderneſſe: others were proper and peculiarly appointed for their habitation in the land of Canaan: therefore for diſtinction ſake of theſe from the other, he cals them perpetuall, whereby may bee underſtood, that they ought not any where to be changed, or ever intermitted, unleſſe God ſignifie that it is his will ſo to bee. Which manner of ſpeaking, ſince it is commonly uſed by all people, they ought not to wonder at; conſidering that

in their law the ſame is called a perpetuall ſtatute, and a perpetuall bondage, which continues onely from one Iubily to another: And the comming of the Meſſias is called the accompliſhment of the Iubily, or the greateſt Iubily of all. Thus in the Hebrew Prophets there was anciently a promiſe of making a new covenant, as in Ierem. 31. where God promiſeth that hee will make a new covenant which ſhall bee put into their inward parts, and written in their hearts; neither ſhall men have annoed that one ſhall learne Religion of another for the ſame ſhall be manifeſt unto all, and they ſhall all know.

               THe firſt and chiefe thing to be conſidered, are the ſacrifices, which many of the Hebrewes thinke were invented by man, before that they were commanded by God. And true it is indeed, the Hebrewes, were deſirous of

many rites and ceremonies, which might bee the reaſon why God enjoyned them ſo many; Or elſe becauſe hee would not have them returne unto the worſhip of fulſe Gods, by the remembrance of their ſojourning in Egypt.
               
               Howbeit when their poſterity made ſo great reckoning of them, as though of themſelves they had beene acceptable unto God, and a part of true piety; then did the Prophets reprehend them for it: I will not reprove thee, ſaith God by David, in the fiftieth Pſalme, for thy ſacrifices, or thy burnt offerings to have beene continually before mee. I will take no bullocke out of thy houſe, nor hee goats out of thy folds.

Then having ended the ſaying unto the godly, as his manner is, he ſpeakes unto the wicked: But unto the wicked

God ſaith. To the ſame ſenſe wee may cite other places, as in the 51. Pſal. Thou deſireſt not ſacrifice, elſe would I give it thee, but thou delighteſt not in burnt offerings. The ſacrifice of God is a brokē Spirit: a broken and contrite heart O God thou wilt not deſpiſe. So likewiſe in the fortieth Pſalme; Sacrifice and offering thou didſt not defire, mine eares haſt thou opened; burnt offering and ſin offering haſt thou not required. Then ſaid I, loe, I come: In the volume of the book it is written of me: I delight to doe thy will, O my God: yea thy law is within my heart. I have preached righteouſneſſe in the great congregation: Loe, I have not refrained my lips O Lord, thou knoweſt. I have not hid thy righteouſneſſe within my heart, I have declared thy faithfulneſſe and thy ſalvation: I have not concealed thy loving kindneſſe, and thy truth from the great congregation.

               NOw what we have declared concerning the law of ſacrifices, the ſame may bee proved of that law which forbids the uſe of ſome kinds of meats. For it is plain

that after Noahs great flood God gave licence unto his poſterity to uſe any ſort of victuall: This law or licence paſſed not only to Iaphet and Cham, but alſo unto Sem and his poſterity, to wit, Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob. But afterward when the people being in Egypt were addicted to vaine ſuperſtitions of that Countrey; then began God to forbid them the eating of ſome kinde of living creatures; either becauſe the Egyptians offered the ſame creatures unto their Gods and made d

out of Egypt thou ſhalt alwayes finde. For after that the people were brought out of Aegypt, and had happily paſſed over the red Sea, the firſt day was celebrated a Sabbath of reſt and ſafety; wherin they ſang a Song of triumph and rejoicing: from which time that exact reſt upon the Sabbath was commanded, which is firſt mentioned upon occaſion of gathering the Manna, Exod. 16. 23. Exod. 35. 2. Levit. 23. 3. And in this ſenſe the deliverance from Aegypt is rendred to be a reaſon for the law of the Sabbath, Deut. 5. 15. By which law it was provided alſo for ſervants againſt the ſeverity of thoſe maſters that would not permit them to coaſe from daily labour, as may be ſeene in the places aforeſaid. It is true indeed, ſtrangers were bound to obſerve this law becauſe it was meet there ſhould bee one forme of reſt among all the people, but

this law of ſo exact reſting upon the Sabbath was not given to other people, as may appeare for that in many places it is called a ſ

                     e, and a ſpeciall covenant betweene God and the Iſraelites, as in Exod. 31. 13. &amp; 16. Now wee have proved before by the promiſe of farre greater benefits that the ordinances which were inſtituted for a memoriall of the comming out from Aegypt were not ſuch as ought never to ceaſe. Adde moreover, if the law concerning the reſt upon the Sabbath had beene given from the beginning, and in that ſenſe that it never might be aboliſhed; then ſurely the ſame had overſwayed in coping with other lawes; which now makes againſt it. For it is evident that infant, may be rightly circumciſed upon the Sabbath; like as during the time that the Temple ſtood there were beaſts killed for ſacrifice aſwell upon

the Sabbath as upon other daies. Yea the Hebrew Maſters themſelves ſhew the mutability of this law, when they ſay, that by the Prophets appointment and command a worke may be rightly done upon the Sabbath day: And this they prove by the taking of Ierico upon the Sabbath according to the commandement of Ioſhuah. And ſome of them not unfitly ſhew that the diſtinction of dayes ſhall bee taken away in the time of the Meſſias, namely from that place in Iſaiah, chap. 66.

               IN the next place let us come to circumciſion, which certainly is Elder than Moſes: For it was given in command to Abraham and his poſterity.
               
               Howbeit the commandement thereof was the introduction o
                     •
                   beginning of the covenant publiſhed by Moſes: For thus we read that God ſpake unto Abraham▪ Gen. 17. ſaying, I will give unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee, the land wherein thou art a ſtranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlaſting poſſeſſion, and I will be their God. And God ſaid unto, Abraham, Thou ſhalt keep my covenant therefore, thou and thy ſeed after thee: every man-child among you ſhall be circumciſe
                        •
                     . But now we know by what hath bin already ſaid, that in the place of this

                  covenant, a new covenant was to ſucceed which ſhould bee common to all people: Wherefore the neceſſity therof, which is the note of diſtinction, ought to ceaſe. Beſides, in the precept of circumciſion there was a myſticall and more excellent ſignifications contained, which the Prophets doe plainely ſhew in that they command the circumciſion of the heart, which all the commandements of Ieſus aime at.
               Wherefore the promiſes annexed to the circumciſion are in like manner to bee referred to ſome greater thing; As namely that of earthly poſſeſſions is referred to the poſſeſſion of eteruity in the heavens; which was never made more manifeſt than by Ieſus: So that promiſe of making Abraham a father of many nations, hath reference to that time, when not a few onely but an infinite number of people diſperſed thorowout

the whole world ſhould imitate Abrahams faith and confidence in God, which is ſo often mentioned in ſeripture; and this can onely bee in the time of 
                     ••
                  e Gospell. Now it, is no marvell if the ſhadowes of an intended matter be taken away, when the matter it ſelfe is accompliſhe. Laſtly, that the grace of God was not tyed to this ſigne wee may caſily diſcerne, becauſe not onely the ancients, but Abraham himſelfe having not as yet received circumciſion, pleaſed God: The Hebrewes alſo dining all the time of their journey through the deſarts of Arabia, omitted circumciſion, and yet God found no fault with them for it.
            
            
               
               SECT. XII.
               
                  And yet the Apostles of Ieſus were gentle in the toleration of theſe things.
               
               NO doubt but the Hebrewes had cauſe to yeeld many thankes to Ieſus and his diſciples or Ambaſſadors, for that by Chriſt they might bee freed from that heavy yoke of ceremonies, and ſhould bee aſſured of this their freedome both by gifts and miracles, ſuch as were not inferiour to thoſe that were wrought by Moſes aforeſaid.
               Neither did the firſt publiſhers of our Chriſtian doctrine exact ſo much of them as to acknowledge this their happineſſe: But if they would admit of the Commandements of Chriſt, which were full of all, honeſty; they freely and▪ willingly ſuffered them to follow what courſe of life they

pleaſed in matters of indifferency. Thus neither were the ſtrangers (to whom this law of rites was never given) bound of neceſſity to obſerve the ſame. Which one thing is ſufficiēt to make it plainly appeare that the Iewes doe unjuſtly reject the doctrine of Chriſt under that pretence of the ceremoniall law. Having then anſwered this objection which chiefly is alleaged againſt the miracles of Ieſus: we will now come to other arguments, which may fitly ſerve for the conſutation of the Iewes.

               IT is agreed upon betweene us and the Iewes about the predictions of the Prophets, that amongſt the many authors and donors of great good things to the

                  Hebrewes, there was one man promiſed farre more excellent than the reſt, whom by a common name they call a Meſſias; which appellation is proper unto him after a ſingular manner. This Meſſias we ſay is come long agoe, but they expect him as yet for to come. It remaines then that that we enquire the truth hereof out of thoſe bookes, the authority whereof wee both doe joyntly acknowledge.
            
            
               SECT. XIIII.
               
                  Who is proved to bee already come, by the limitted time of his comming which was fore told.
               
               THe Prophet Daniel, whoſe ſingular piety is commended by Ezekiel, neither would willingly deceive us, nor was hee himſelfe deceived by the Angell Gabriel: yet being taught by the

ſame Angell, in the ninth chapter of his Prophecie hee hath left it recorded, that before the ſpace of five hundred yeares ſhould be expired, after the promulgation of the de
                        •
                     ree touching the reſtoring of the City Hieruſalem, the Meſſias ſhould come. But now ſince that time above two thouſand yeeres have paſſed; and yet he, whom the Iewes expect, is not come; neither can t
                     •
                  ey name any other perſon to whom that ſpace or time can bee rightly applyed; which notwithſtanding agrees ſo fitly unto Ieſus as that Neh
                        •
                     
                     mias, a Rabbi Doctor, who lived about fifty yeares before Chriſt, plainly ſaid then, that the time of the Meſſias foretold by Daniel could not bee protracted beyond thoſe fifty yeeres then next enſuing. And with this note of time, agrees another note which wee have toucht before, to wit, concerning the dominion over all

nations by divine power, after that the poſterity of Seleueus and Lagu
                        •
                     
                   had ceaſed to reigne; the latter whereof ended in Cleopatra, a little before Ieſus was borne. The third note is ſet downe in the foreſaid Chapter of Daniel; namely, that after the comming of the Meſſias, the City of Hieruſalem ſhould bee overthrowne: which Prophecie of the cities deſtruction Ioſephus himſelfe referreth unto his time; whence it followes that the time appointed for the comming of the Meſſias, was then already paſt. Hereunto likewiſe belongs that in the ſecond chapter of the Prophet Haggai, where God by the Prophet incourageth Zerubbabel the ſon of Shealtiel governour of Iudah, and Ioſhuah the ſonne of Ioſedech the high Prieſt, comforting them with this promiſe, that the glory of the latter houſe ſhould be greater than the former: which

certainly can neither bee meant of the greatneſſe of the work, nor of the matter of the building, nor of the fabrick and artificiall ſtructure, nor of the beauty of that Temple, as may appeare by the hiſtory of thoſe times both in the holy ſcriptures and in Ioſephus, compared with that of the Temple of Salomon. But God ſhewes wherein the latter Temple ſhould excell the former, when hee promiſeth (as it were by a certaine covenant) to eſtabliſh his peace, that is, his mercy and loving kindneſſe in that Temple: whereof th
                     •
                   Prophet Malachy ſpeakes more fully in his third Chapter, Behold I will ſend my Meſſenger and he ſhall prepare the way before me; (now Malachy lived when the latter Temple was built,) And the Lord whom yee ſeeke ſhall ſuddenly come to his Temple: even the Meſſenger of the covenant whom yee delight in. Wherefore

the Meſſias ought to come while the ſecond Temple ſtood, which as the Hebrewes note, was during the ſpace betweene Zerubbabel and Veſpaſian: for in the time of Herod the great the Temple was not reedified out of its old r
                     •
                  ines, but by little and little it was repaired, bearing ſtill the name of the ſame Temple. And indeed there was ſo firme an opinion amongſt the Hebrewes and the neighbouring people that the Meſſias was ſurely to come in thoſe times, that many tooke Herod, others Iudas Gaulonites, and a third ſort ſome that lived about the times of Ieſus to be the Meſſias.
               
            
            
               
               SECT. XV.
               
                  Anſwer to that which ſome conceive touching the deforring of his cōming for the ſins of the people.
               
               SOme of the Iewes perceiving themſelves to bee hard put to it by theſe arguments concerning the comming of the Meſſias, doe goe about to ſhift off the ſame by telling us that their fins were the cauſe why hee did not come at the promiſed time. But for anſwer, to omit what is ſhewne in the Prophecies aforeſaid touching the determination of the decree without all exception or uncertainty, how is it poſſible that this comming ſhould be deferred by reaſon of their ſinnes, ſeeing alſo it was foretold that becauſe of the many and hainous tranſgreſſions of the people, the great City ſhould be laid waſte a little after the times of the Meſſias?
                  
Moreover the reaſon why the Meſſias ſhould come was, that he might both adminiſter a medicine to the wicked world, and procure pardon for offences, withall giving good rules for reformation of life. Whereupon in the thirteenth chapter of Zachary, it is meant of his times when it is ſaid that there ſhall be a fountaine opened to the houſe of David, and to the inhabitants of Hieruſalem, for ſinne and for uncleanneſſe. And it is affirmed by the Hebrewes themſelves ſhall bee called Iſh Copher, that is, a reconciler or peacemaker. But it is againſt all reaſon to ſay that any thing was deferred for that diſeaſe, to which it was preciſely deſtinated and appointed.
            
            
               
               SECT. XVI.
               
                  Alſo from the preſent ſtate of the Iewes compared with thoſe things which the Law promiſeth.
               
               TOuching this which we affirme of the comming of the Meſſias long ſince into the world, the Iewes are convinced by very ſenſe. God made a covenant with Moſes, and promiſed to them the happy poſſeſſion of the land of Paleſtina, ſo long as they ſhould lead their life according to the commandements of the law: But contrarily hee threatned baniſhment and ſuch like calamity to come upon them if they did grievouſly tranſgreſſe the ſame. Yet if at any time they were afflicted with miſeries, and repenting of their ſinnes returned unto obedience; then would he be moved to have mercy upon the people, and

cauſe that though they were ſcattered to the uttermoſt parts of the earth, yet ſhould they returne againe into their owne countrey
                        •
                     
                   as wee may reade in Deut. 30 &amp; Nehem. 1. and elſe-where. But now for the ſpace of one thouſand five hundred yeares and more, the Iewes have wanted a Countrey and a Temple, which when they would have built anew, they were alwayes hindered by ſome empediment or other. When this people in times paſt had defiled themſelves with abominable wickedneſſes, every where ſacrificing even their children unto Saturne, accounting adultery to be no ſinne, oppreſſing and ſpoiling the fatherleſſe and widows, and ſhedding the innocent bloud in great abundance, all which the Prophets did upbraid them with; then did they ſufferexile, yet only for the ſpace of ſeventy yeares, during which

time God did not neglect to ſpeak unto them by his Prophets and to comfort them with the hope of a returne, pointing alſo at the very time thereof. But now ever ſince they were expelled out of their Countrey, they continue baniſhed and contemptible: No Prophet comes unto them: there is no ſigne or token of their returne. Their Maſters and ring-

                  ers (as if they were blaſted with the ſpirit of giddineſſe
                        •
                     ) are fallen away to filthy fables and doctrines very ridiculous, where with the bookes of the Talmud do abound: which they are bold to call the law given by word of mouth, and are wont to equall or preferre the ſame to that which was delivered by Moſes. For ſuch things as are therein to be read concerning Gods weeping and lamenting becauſe hee had ſuffered the city to bee deſtroyed; of his daily care and diligence in reading the law;
                  
of Behemoth and Leviathan, and many other matters, are ſo abſurd that it would be tedious and irkſome to repeat them. Howbeit the Iewes in all this time have neither turned to the worſhip of falſe Gods, as they did in times paſt; neither have they defiled themſelves with cruelty, nor are they accuſed of fornication and adultery: But by prayers and faſtings they labour to appeaſe Gods wrath, and yet are not heard. Which things being ſo, one of theſe two muſt needs bee granted, namely, that either the covenant that was given by Moſes is quite aboliſhed; or the Iewes are guilty of ſome notorious crime, which hath continued for ſo many ages together: which what it is let themſelves ſpeake: or if they cannot tell, then let them beleeve us that this ſinne is no other but the contempt of the Meſſias, who was come before

that theſe evils began to fall upon them.
            
            
               SECT. XVII.
               
                  Ieſus is proved to be the Meſſias by thoſe Prophecies which were foretold concerning the Meſſias.
               
               BY this which hath been ſpoken it is manifeſt that the Meſſias came many ages agoe: wee adde further that the ſame is no other but Ieſus. For what other perſons ſoever either were or would have been accounted the Meſſias, the ſame left no ſect behind them to uphold &amp; maintain that opinion. There are not any at this day that profeſſe themſelves to bee followers either of Herod, or of Iudas Gaulonita, or of that great impoſtor Barchochebas, who living in the times of Adrian ſaid that he was the Meſſias, and deceived ſome even of the

more learned. But thoſe that profeſſe the name of Ieſus, have continued from the time that hee lived upon earth, even untill this day being not a few onely in this or that countrey, but very many diſperſed as farre as the world extendeth. I could alleage many other teſtimonies anciently foretold concerning the Meſſias, which wee beleeve were accompliſhed in Ieſ
                        •…
                     , ſince they cannot bee affirmed of any other: as namely that he came of the poſterity of David, and was borne of a Virgin; which was divinely revealed to him that married that Virgin; whom hee would have put away, ſuppoſing ſhee had been got with child by another; Alſo that this Meſſias was borne at Bethlehem, and began firſt to publiſh his doctrine in Galilee, healing all kindes of diſeaſes, giving ſight to the blinde, and making the lame to walke: but this

one may ſuffice for many, that his doctrine continues entire unto this day. It is moſt manifeſt by the Prophecies of David, Iſaiah, Zachariah, and Hoſea, that the Meſſias was to bee an inſtructor not onely of the Iewes but alſo of the Gentile: by whom all worſhippings of falſe Gods ſhould come to ruine, and a huge multitude of aliens and ſtrangers ſhould bee brought to the worſhip of the only true God. Before this Ieſus his comming almoſt the whole world was confounded with falſe worſhips and religions: which afterward by little and little began to vaniſh away, and many men both of the common ſort and of higher ranke, as Kings and Princes were converted unto the worſhip and ſervice of one God. This was no grammercy to the Iewiſh Rabbins; but to the Diſciples of Ieſus and their ſucceſſors. Thus they were made the people
                  
of God, that before were not the people of God; and the ſaying o

               THe Iewes uſually object that ſame things were foretold concerning the times of the Meſſias, which are not yet fulfilled. But for anſwer, thoſe matters which they alleage are obſcure and admit of divers ſignifications: wherefore they are not to be received before ſuch things as are more manifeſt; as namely the holineſſe
                  
of the commandements of Ieſus; the excellency of the reward, and the perſpicuous language, wherein it is propounded: to which if we adde the teſtimony of his miracles, there need no other motive for inducement to the receiving of his doctrine. As for thoſe Prophecies which g

                     y expounded, as themſelves cannot deny. And if any man pleaſe to compare either the ancient interpreters which lived when the people were led captive into Babylon, or ſuch as lived about Chriſts time, with thoſe that writ after that Chriſtianity began to bee hatefull and odious

unto the Iewes, hee ſhall finde no expoſitions purpoſely invented, to croſſe thoſe former that well agreed with Chriſtian interpretations. They know well enough that there are many things in the holy ſcriptures which muſt bee underſtood by a trope, and not in property of ſpeech; as when God is ſaid to have deſcended; and to have a mouth, eares, eyes and noſtrils. And why may not we likewiſe expound divers things that are ſpoken of the times of the Meſſias after the ſame manner; as that the wolfe ſhall dwell with the lambe, and the Leopard ſhall lye downe with the k
                        •
                     d, and the c

               There are ſome things promiſed
                  
which by antecedent and conſequent words, or by the very ſenſe imply a ſecret condition in them. Thus God promiſed many things unto the Hebrewes upon condition they would receive the Meſſias that was ſent, and obey him: which ſame things if they come not to paſſe accordingly, then may they blame themſelves that are the cauſe thereof.
               Againe, other matters were promiſed expreſly and wi

                     •
                  vident even among the Iewes, that the time or Kingdome of the Meſſias muſt endure unto the end of the world.

                  And to that which is objected of the meane condition and death of Ieſus.
               
               MAny doe take exception at the meeke and meane condition of Ieſus: but unjuſtly, becauſe in ſacred writ it is often ſaid that God will exalt the humble and meeke, but caſt downe the proud. Iacob when bee paſſed over Iordan carried nothing with him ſave his ſtaffe only; and yet was enriched with a great ſlocke of ſheepe.
               
                  Moſes was a poore exile, and feeding the ſlockes, when God appeared to him in the buſh, and gave him commiſſion for the conduct of his people. David alſo was called to his Kingdome when hee was feeding

Now concerning the Meſſias, we reade, that he ſhould bee a gladſome Meſſenger unto the poore, that hee ſhould make no noiſe in publike, or uſe any ſtrife and contention, but deale gently, forbearing to breake the ſhaken reed, and unwilling to quench the ſmoaking

As touching that ſhift which ſome later Iewes have invented, telling us that the Prophet ſpeakes here of the Hebrewes diſperſed thorow all nations, that by his owne example and manner of ſpeech hee might every where gaine the more Proſelytes; this ſenſe firſt of all is repugnant to many teſtimonies of holy writ which ſay, that no harme is befalne the Iewes, which they by their evill deeds have not deſerved, and a great deale more. Then againe the very forme of the Propheticall ſpeech beares not that interpretation For either the Prophet, (which ſeemes more proper to that place) or God ſaith: This evill happened unto him for the iniquities of my people. Now the people of Iſaiah, or the peculiar people of God, are the people of the Hebrewes, therefore hee who is ſaid by Iſaiah to

have ſuffred for grievous things, cannot be that people.

Howbeit better it were, and more conſonant with the writings of the Prophets, to acknowledge but one Meſſias, who was to paſſe unto his Kingdome through many difficulties and death it ſelfe, which we beleeve of Ieſus, as the matter it ſelfe declares to be moſt true.

But concerning the quality of their Anceſtors, (that they may ſee I doe them no wrong) let them heare the words of their owne law and Prophets, wherein they are often called uncircumciſ

                  Ioſeph; and in very deed ſold him into bondage. It was their anceſtors that by their continuall mutinies and ſeditions made Moſes weary of his life, who was their leader and redeemer, to whom the earth, the ſea, and the A

Theſe were they that loathed the bread that was ſent from heaven; complaining as though they had beene in greateſt want and ſcarcity, even when they belched up againe the fowle and food that they had eaten. It was their Anceſtors that forſaking David ſo excellent and good a King, followed Abſolon his rebellious ſonne. It was their Anceſters that ſlew Zachariah the ſonne of

                     iada in the moſt holy place, ſo making their Prieſt himſelfe an oblation of their cruelty in the very Court of the houſe of the Lord. Now concerning the Prieſts, they were ſuch as conſpired the death of Ieremy by a falſe

accuſation, and had kild him indeed, unleſſe they had been hindered by the authority of the governors: notwithſtanding which, they prevailed ſo farre as to have him impriſoned untill the very moment that the City was taken. If any man imagine thoſe were any thing better that lived in the times of Ieſus, then Ioſephus will ſhew him his error, who deſcribes their villanous acts and grievous torments, the like were never heard of, and yet as hee thinkes, below deſert. Neither may wee conceive more favourably of their great Councellor Senate; ſpecially becauſe at that time the Senators were not choſen after the old cuſtome by laying on of hands, but by the favour, becke, or ſway of great men. Neither were the Prieſts elected for terme of life, but obtained the dignity of Prieſt-hood onely from yeare to yeare, and that oftentimes for

                  money. We need not then wonder if men that were puffed up with pride, being boundleſſe in their ambition and covetouſneſſe, did breake out into fury and madneſſe, when they beheld a man that by his holy precepts and upright behaviour, reproved their farre different life and vitious converſation. Neither did it happen otherwiſe to him in point of reproach and miſ-uſage, than to the beſt of the Prophets that lived long before. Thus that Micaiah, that lived in the time of Iehoſaphat, was caſt into priſon, becauſe he boldly ſpake the truth againſt the opinion and ſentence of foure hundred lying Prophets. Ahab upbraided Eli

                     ah, juſt as the Prieſts did Ieſus, ſaying, that he was the man that troubled the peace of Iſrael. So likewiſe Ieremy was accuſed as well as Ieſus for propheſying againſt the Temple. Adde moreover what the ancient Doctors
                  
of the Hebrewes foretold, namely how that in the times of the Meſſias, there ſhould bee men like to bruit beaſts in their cur

God himſelfe, foreſeeing long before how moſt of the Iewes would ſtand affected in the time of the Meſſias, ſaid it would come to paſſe that they ſhould become his people, who were not his people; and of all the Cities and Townes of the Iewes ſcarce one or two would goe to the holy mountaine: Howbeit that which was defective in their number ſhould bee ſupplyed by ſtrangers: Alſo that the Meſſias ſhould bee a downfall to the Hebrewes: and this ſtone which the builders refuſed, ſhould bee put in the chiefe place for the accompliſhment of the worke.

                  Anſwer to the objection, that many Gods are worſhipped by the Chriſtians.
               
               THere remaine yet two objections to bee anſwered which the Iewes alleage both againſt our Chriſtian doctrine and worſhip. The firſt is in that they ſay wee Chriſtians doe worſhip many Gods.
               
               But we anſwer that this is nothing but a forced expoſition of anothers opinion out of hatred. For why ſhould this be more objected againſt us Chriſtians, than againſt Philo the Iew, who oftentimes makes three powers or vertues to bee in God, and cals the reaſon or the word of God, the name of God, the maker of the wo

                  ld; neither uncreate as is God the father of all, nor ſo begotten as other men are. Or againſt the

                  Cabaliſts, who diſtinguiſh God into three lights, by the ſame names that Chriſtians doe; to wit, of the Father, of the Sonne or the word, and of the holy Ghoſt. And not to omit what is agreed upon by all the Hebrewes, the ſame Spirit wherewith the Prophets were moved and inſpired is not any created thing, and yet it is diſtinguiſhed from the ſender thereof: as alſo that which they commonly call ſchecina: others the name of God, as Philo; and others his viſage or countenance: Moſes the ſonne of Nehema
                        •…
                     s, as alſo Philo cals it the Archangell or chiefe Ambaſſador that regards the world, and ſometimes God. Now many of the Hebrewes have taught that that divine power which they terme wiſdome, ſhall dwell in the Meſſias; whence by the Chaldee Paraphraſt the Meſſias is called the word of God: So like wiſe the

                  Meſſias by David, Iſaiah, and others is ſtiled by thoſe renowned names of God and Lord.

                  And that a humane nature is worſhipped.
               
               WIth like facility may we anſwer the other objection which they alleage againſt us, ſaying that we exhibit unto the creature that worſhip and honour, which is due unto God the creator. For wee ſay that no other honour or worſhip is given by us unto the Meſſias than is required by the eleventh and the hundred and tenth Pſalmes. The former whereof after a ſort was fulfilled in David, but after a more excellent manner belongs unto the Meſſias, as David Kimhi himſelfe a great adverſary of Chriſtians doth acknowledge. And

the latter can bee expounded of no other but of the Meſſias. For that which ſome later Iewes have fained and imagined of Abraham, David, and Hezekiah, is but vaine and

                        •…
                     ſcription doth ſhew: That then which David ſaith, The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, can neither be applyed to David himſelfe, nor to Hezekiah, who amongſt Davids poſterity did excell David in nothing. And Abraham had no ſingular Prieſthood, but was bleſſed of Melchiſedeck, as the leſſe of the greater. Likewiſe that which followes concerning the ſcepter that ſhould goe out of Sion and come to the uttermoſt coaſts, doth plainely appertaine unto the Meſſias, as is manifeſt by other like places which doubtleſſe are meant of the Meſſias; being no otherwiſe received by the more ancient Hebrewes
                  
and Paraphraſts. Now I may as well beleeve that it is Ieſus of Nazareth in whom properly theſe things are fulfilled, being induced thereunto by the ſingular integrity and honeſty of his Diſciples, who conſtantly affirme the ſame; as the Iewes beleeve Moſes in thoſe matters which without any other witneſſe, himſelfe affirmed were delivered to him of God. But beſides this there are many forcible argumen
                        •
                     s of that moſt excellent power, which wee ſay Ieſus hath obtained; As namely in that hee was ſeene of many after he was riſen from the dead: And many beheld him when he was taken up into heaven: Devils alſo were caſt out, and diſeaſes were cured onely by his name. So were the gift of tongues given to his Diſciples, which Ieſus himſelfe promiſed ſhould bee ſignes of his Kingdome.

Adde unto theſe, that his Scepter, that is, the word of the Goſpell is gone out of Sion, being ſpread abroad to the utmoſt parts of the earth, not by mans might, but only by divine power: The nations alſo and Kings are ſubdued unto him, as the ſaid Pſalmes did plainly foretell. The Iewiſh Cabaliſts place a certaine ſonne of E

               Neither doth this tend to leſſen or diminiſh the dignity of God the Father, from whom this power of Ieſus doth proceed, to whom alſo it muſt returne, and to whoſe honour the ſame doth appertaine.

namely, how that true and ſincere godlineſſe, which flouriſhed even amongſt the Chriſtians that were grievouſly tormented and oppreſſed, afterward began by little and little to wax cold, to wit, from that time that by the meanes of Conſtantine and other Emperours, the ſame profeſſion became not onely ſafe, but alſo honourable, the world being as it were thruſt into the Church. For firſt of all when Chriſtian Princes might have enjoyed peace and quietneſſe, then would they needs bee fighting and ſtill up in armes.
               Amongſt the Biſhops alſo there was hot and bitter contention about the chiefeſt Sees: And as at the beginning very much hurt enſued upon the preferring of the tree of knowledge before the

                   of life, ſo did there great harme follow in theſe times when curioſity of knowledge was more regarded

than a godly life, when piety and Religion was made a deceitfull or cunning art. For afterward ſo it happened, as to them that built the Tower of Babylon, the indiſcreet affectation of high matters above their reach, bred nothing but jarring and confuſed ſpeeches, together with diſagreement in opinion: which the common ſort obſerving, they were driven into a quandary, often doubting what to thinke or which way to turne themſelves, laying all the blame upon the holy ſcriptures, and began to eſchew them as hurtfull and dangerous.
               
               Then began Religion, (as if Iudaiſme had beene revived again,) generally to conſiſt more in 
                     •

                  obſtinately perſiſting in that opinion which they had once embraced, till at length it came to that paſſe, that in each place there were many Chriſtians by name, but really and indeed very few.
               
                  God did not winke at theſe tranſgreſſions of his people: but from the utmoſt parts of S

               Howbeit this judgement of God upon them prevailed not to worke thoſe Chriſtians that ſurvived to amendment; whereupon by his juſt permiſſion, Mahumet began to plant a new Religion in Arabia, ſuch as was manifeſtly oppoſite to Chriſtian Religion: yet after a ſort in words it did expreſſe the life of a great part of Chriſtians.
               
               This Religion was firſt received

by the Saracens, who revolted from Heraclius the Emperour, and in a ſhort ſpace by their martiall enterpriſes won Arabia, Syria, Paleſtina, Egypt, Perſia, Africa and Spaine. But the power and might of

Then having taken the cities of Aſia and Greece, with ſucceſſe in their Martiall attempts, they entred upon Hangary and the borders of Germany.

               THis Religion being fully framed for the ſhedding of blood, abounds with rites and ceremonies, and muſt bee beleeved without all liberty of enquiry there into; whence the vulgar are prohibited to reade the books that are accounted holy. Which thing ſeemes a manifeſt argument of the iniquity thereof; For juſtly may that Merchandiſe bee ſuſpected, which is vendible onely upon condition it may not be ſeene.
               
               It is true indeed, there is not in all men a like capacity or knowledge, and quicke in-ſight into all things; many being led into errour by pride; others by inordinate paſſion or affection;

and ſome by cuſtome. But the divine goodneſſe forbids us to thinke that thoſe men may not know and finde the way to eternall ſalvation, who ſeek the ſame, not for any by-reſpect of profit or honour, but with ſubmiſſion of themſelves and all they have unto God, imploring his aſſiſtance for the obtaining of the ſame. And ſince that God hath implanted in the mind of man the power and faculty of underſtanding, there is no part of truth that better deſerves the imployment thereof than that which cannot bee unknowne without the danger of loſing eternall ſalvation.

                     •
                   to give one example for many, all the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt with one conſent doe teſtifie that Ieſus was crucified; that the third day he was reſtored to life again, and after that was ſeene of many. But Mahumet teacheth quite contrary▪ 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   namely, that Ieſus was

privily taken up into heaven: not himſelfe, but ſome thing in his likeneſſe was nailed to the Croſſe; and conſequently; he did not die; but the ſight of the Iewes was deluded and deceived.
               This objection cannot bee put off, unleſſe Mahumet ſay, (as he doth) that the bookes of Moſes and of Chriſts diſciples have not remained as they were at firſt; but have beene corrupted. Howbeit wee have-confuted this fiction before in the third booke.
               Certes, if any man ſhould ſay that the Alchoran is corrupted, the Mahumetans would deny it; and that were enough to ſay for an anſwer ſufficient to thoſe that could not prove the contrary. But they, for the integrity of their booke, cannot alleage ſuch arguments, as we doe produce, concerning the ſeverall copies that were in a ſhort ſpace diſperſed thorowout the world, and that, not

as the Alchoran, in one language; which copies were preſerved by the faithfull dealing of ſo many ſects, that varied much about other matters.
               The Mahumetans are perſwaded that in the fourteenth chapter of Iohn, where mention is made of ſending the comforter, there had beene ſomething regiſtred concerning Mahumet, which the Chriſtians have razed out. But here let me aske of them, whether they thinke this depravation of ſcripture was committed ſince the time of Mahumet, or before.
               That it happened not after the comming of Mahumet is plaine, becauſe ever ſince that time there have been in the world very many Copies, not only in the Greeke language, but in the Syriacke, Arabicke, Ethiopicke and Latine tongues of divers tranſlations: all which doe ſo agree in that ſame

place, as there cannot be ſhowen any diverſity at all. Next before the time of Mahumet there was no cauſe of alteration: For no man could know before his comming what Mahumet would teach. Yea, if the doctrine o
                     •
                   
                  Mahumet had contained nothing contrary to the doctrine of Ieſus, the Chriſtians would have made no more a-doe to receive his books than they did to receive the bookes of Moſes and the Hebrew Prophets. Or ſuppoſe there was nothing written either of the doctrine of Ieſus or of Mahumet, yet it is but equity that that ſhould bee received for the doctrine of Ieſus which all Chriſtians generally agree upon; and that for the doctrine of Mahumet which all Mahumetans doe allow of.

                  By comparing Mahumet with Chriſt in their perſons.
               
               IN the next place let us compare the adjuncts and quality of both their doctrines, to the end wee may ſee whether of the two is to bee preferred before the other: And firſt wee may conſider the dignity and worth of the authors. As for Ieſus, Mahumet himſelfe confeſſeth, that hee was the Meſſias, which was promiſed in the law and in the Prophets; whom the ſame Mahumet cal, the word, the minde and the wiſdome of God; ſaying alſo that hee had no father by mankind.
               But Mahumet (as his owne followers beleeve) was generated and begot according to the ordinary courſe of nature. The life of Ieſus was altogether unblameable, there being no crime that

could bee objected againſt him: But Mahumet a long time was a rob

               NExt the dignity of their perſons conſider we their acts. Ieſus gave ſight to the blinde, health to them that were ſicke, and made the lame to walke; yea by Mahumets owne confeſſion, hee raiſed ſome from the dead. But Mahumet-ſaith of himſelfe that hee was ſent, not with miracles, but with feats and inſtruments of warre. Howbeit ſome of his followers grace him with miracles:
                  
But what kind I pray? Only ſuch as may bee done by humane are; as that of a Dove that came flying to his eare: or ſuch as had no eye-witneſſes, as that of a Camel, which is ſaid to have had ſome conference with him by night: or laſtly ſuch as for their abſurdity are incredible, and ſo need no further confutation; as that a great part of the Moone fell into his lap, or into his ſleeve; and he, to preſerve the roundneſſe of that ſtar, threw the ſame part up agoine. Now who will not ſay that in a doubtfull caſe wee muſt yeeld rather to that law, which hath the more certaine teſtimonies of divine approbation▪

               NExt, let us ſee who and what manner of perſons they were that firſt received theſe ſeverall lawes. They that firſt embraced the law of Ieſus, were ſuch as feared God, men of an innocent life: Now it ſtands not with the goodneſſe of God to ſuffer ſuch men to bee guld and

                  The manner how both their lawes were propagated.
               
               IN the next place followes the manner how both their ſeveral Religions were propagated and ſpread abroad. As for Chriſtianity we have ſhowne before by what meanes it was inlarged and amplified, to wit, by the miracles, not onely of Chriſt, but alſo of his Diſciples, and thoſe that ſucceeded them: as like wiſe by the very patient enduring of the torment, and puniſhments that Chriſtians ſuffered. But the Doctors of Mahumetiſme wrought no miracles at all: neither did they ſuffer any grievous perſecutions, or bitter kinds of death for their profeſſion: But as their Religion was bred, ſo hath it beene maintained by warre; they having no better argument for the truth
                  
thereof, than their good ſucceſſe in their martiall enterpriſes, and the largeneſſe of their Empire; than the which nothing in this point is more deceitfull and uncertaine.
               They condemne the worſhip and ſervices of the Pagan: and yet we know what great victories the Pagans have had, as is plaine of the Perſians, Maced
                        •
                     ni

                     s and Romans; and how ample their dominions were. Neither have the Mahumetans themſelves had alwayes good ſucceſſe with their armies. The ſlaughters and great overthrowes that they have received in many places both by Sea and by Land, are not unknowne. They are now baniſhed quite out of all Spaine.
               
               There is nothing that ſuffers ſuch alterations and changing, nothing that may bee common both to good and bad, which can bee a certaine note of true Religion:
                  
much leſſe can their warrings, which are ſo unjuſt that oftentimes they quarrell and contend with ſome people that doe not any way moleſt or offend them, and they are wont to ſet upon ſuch as offer them no injury at all; in ſo much that all the pretence they have for contending, is onely the cauſe of Religion, which is a moſt ungodly thing.
               For there is no true worſhip of God, but what proceeds from a willing minde. And the will may bee well wrought upon by good inſtruction and gentle perſwaſion, but not ſo well by rigorous threats or violence. Hee that is compelled to beleeve, doth not beleeve at all, but playes the hypocrite, and faines himſelfe to beleeve that hee may eſcape and avoid ſome danger or puniſhment. And hee that by awe or ſenſe of puniſhment will force another mans aſſent, gives juſt occaſion

thereby to ſuſpect that hee diſtruſts his other arguments. Againe they deſtroy the very pretence of their Religion, in that they ſuffer any people that live under their dominion, to uſe what Religion they pleaſe: yea, and ſometimes they will openly acknowledge, that Chriſtians may bee ſaved by their owne law.
               
            
            
               SECT. VIII.
               
                  The precepts of both Religions compared.
               
               FVrthermore let us compare the ſeverall commandements of both Religions: the one wherof commandeth patience, yea and love even to them that are hatefull: But in the other revenge is allowed of. In the one the bond of matrimony is kept firme and inviolable betweene the married parties, by a mutuall bearing with

one anothers conditions: But in the other there is licence granted to depart and be divorced. Here the Huſband performes himſelfe what he requires of his wife, and by his owne example teacheth her to fallen her affection upon him alone: But there they may have wives after wives, there being ſtill new incentives and freſh provocations to luſt. Here, Religion is planted within, and rooted in the very heart and ſoule, to the end the ſame may bring forth fruit profitable for mankind: but there Religion conſiſts for the moſt part in Circumciſion, and in ſome other things that of themſelves are neither good nor bad. Finally here, in Chriſtianity a moderate uſe of meats and wine is allowed of: but there in Mahumetiſme men are forbidden to eat ſwines fleſh and to drink wine: which notwithſtanding is a great gift of God, beneficiall both

for body and minde, if it bee ſoberly taken.
               And it is no wonder if ſome childiſh rudiments were taught before ſo perfect a law as that of Chriſt is: But after the promulgation thereof, to returne againe to types and figures were prepoſtetous. Neither can any juſt reaſon be given why after Chriſtian Religion, which is clearely the beſt, there ſhould any other bee propounded and taught.
            
            
               SECT. IX.
               
                  Anſwer to the Mahumetans objection concerning the Son of God.
               
               THE Mahumetans tell us they are not a little diſpleaſed with us for ſaying that God hath a ſonne, ſeeing he uſeth not a wife: As though the word ſonne could not have a more divine ſignification in God. But Mahumet
                  
himſelfe attributes many things as diſhonorable and ill-beſeeming God, as if he ſhould be ſaid to have a wife:
               
               Thus hee ſaith that God had a cold hand, which himſelfe knew by experience: that God was carried in a chaire and the like.
               Howbeit when wee ſay that Ieſus is the ſonne of God, we doe but ſignifie the ſame thing that he meanes when hee cals him the word of God: For the word is after a ſort generated of the minde. Adde further that hee was borne of a Virgin onely by the operation of God, ſupplying the vertue or eſticacy of a Father: that by the power of God, hee was carried up into heaven; all which being confeſſed even by Mahumet himſelfe, doe ſhew that Ieſus by a ſingular pre
                     •
                  ogative and peculiar right may and ought to be called the ſonne of God.
               
            
            
               
               SECT. X.
               
                  Many abſurd things in the bookes of Mahumetans.
               
               BVt on the other ſide it would be long to relate how many things there are, contrary to the truth of hiſtory; and many things very ridiculous in the writings of the Mahumetans. Such is that fable of a faire and beautiful woman that learned a ſolemne thar
                        ••
                     e or enchanting verſe of ſome Angels that were merry with wine, whereby ſhee was wont to aſcend into the sky, and likewiſe deſcend againe; and aſcending once a great height into heaven, ſhee was caught of God and there made faſt; and ſo was called the ſtarre of Venus.
               
               Like to this is that of a mouſe in Noahs Arke that was bred of an Elephants dung: and a cat of the breath of a lion.
               
               
                  
More ſpecially the moſt notorious fiction of all is that concerning death which ſhould bee changed into a Ramme that muſt remaine in the middle ſpace betweene heaven and hell. Such alſo is the fable of their delicate meats, which they ſay ſhall bee purged out by ſweat in the other life which is to come: When likewiſe (they imagine) there ſhall bee whole troupes of women aſſigned to every man for pleaſure of carnall copulation. All which are ſo very egregious abſurdities that whoſoever beleeves them, deſerves to bee ſtupified and given over to a reprobate ſenſe for his iniquity; ſpecially ſuch a one as lives where the light of the Goſpell ſhineth.
            
            
               
               SECT. XI.
               
                  A concluſion directed unto Chriſtians, admoniſhing them of their duty upon their occaſion of what hath formerly beene handled.
               
               ANd thus having ended this laſt diſputation againſt the Mahumetans, there remaines only a concluſion or exhortation, not to aliens or ſtrangers, but to all ſorts of Chriſtians of what name, nation, or quality ſoever they be: Wherein wee ſhall very briefly ſhew the uſe or application of what hath hitherto beene delivered, to the end thoſe things may be followed and ſought after which are good; and on the contrary the evill eſchewed.
               Firſt of all then let Chriſtians bee exhorted to lift up prire hands and hearts unto that God which of nothing made all viſible and

                  inviſible things; having ſure confidence in him, that his providence and care watcheth over us; ſeeing that without his permiſſion, not ſo much as a Sparrow fals to the ground. And let them not feare thoſe which can only ki
                     •
                  l the body, but rather let then feare him that hath like power both over ſoule and body. And let them not onely truſt in God the Father, but alſo in Ieſus Chriſt his ſonne, ſince there is no other name upon earth by which we can be ſaved: And this they may rightly doe if they can bee verily perſwaded that eternall life is prepared, not for ſuch as in word onely call God their Father, and Ieſus their Lord, but for ſuch as frame their life according to the will of Ieſus, and their Father which is in heaven.
               
               Furthermore Chriſtians may hereby be admoniſhed faithfully and with due care to preſerve

the doctrine of Chriſt as a moſt precious treaſure: And for this cauſe let them often read and meditate the bookes of the holy ſcripture, whereby no man can be deceived, unleſſe firſt hee deceive himſelfe. For the authors and penmen of thoſe writings were more juſt and full of divine inſpiration, than that they would cozen us of neceſſary truthes, or cover and conceale the ſame with any clouds.
               Howbeit for the right underſtanding hereof, wee muſt bring humble mindes, together with obedient hearts and wils: which if wee doe, then nothing ſhall bee hid from us which ought to bee beleeved, hoped for, or done by us: And by this meanes that holy Spirit may bee cheriſhed and excited in us, which is given us for a pledge of our future happineſſe.
               Moreover let Chriſtians hereby

learn not to immitate the cuſtomes of the Pagans, ſpecially in their worſhip of falſe Gods, which are nothing but idle names that the damned ſpirits doe uſe, to alienate our mindes and affections from the worſhip of the true God. Wherefore wee cannot poſſibly participate with them in their ſervices, and expect to receive benefit by the ſacrifice of Chriſt. Secondly, neither may Chriſtians imitate the heathen in their licentious and diſſolute manner oſ life; having no other law than what is ſuggeſted by luſt and prompted by concupiſcence. For it is requiſite and meet that in holy converſation they ſhould not onely farre excell the vitious and prophane Pagans, but likewiſe the lawyers and Phariſies among the Iewes; whoſe righteouſneſſe conſiſting onely in ſome outward performances, could never bring them to the

heavenly Kingdome. Circumciſion that is made with hands is now nothing worth, but it is the inward Circumciſion of the heart, the keeping of Gods commandements, the new creature, faith that is perfected in love, which make men knowne to be true Iſraelites and myſticall Iewes, that is, praiſers of God, and commendable in his ſight. The diſtinction of meats, the Sabbathes and feaſtdayes were but types and ſhadowes of things in Chriſt and in Chriſtians.
               
               In like manner, by occaſion of Mahumetiſme wee may bee admoniſhed of that which our Lord Ieſus foretold, namely that after his time there ſhould ariſe falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets. which ſhould lye, and ſay they were ſent of God. But ſuppoſe that an Angell ſhould come from heaven, yet wee may not receive or entertaine any other doctrine
                  
than that which Chriſt hath left us, confirmed by ſo many teſtimonies. For God, who at ſundry times and in divers manners ſpake unto the godly that lived in times paſt, hath in theſe laſt dayes ſpoken unto us by his ſonne, whom hee hath appointed heire of all things, who is the brightneſſe of his Fathers glory, and the expreſſe image of his ſubſtance, by whom all things are created that ever were or ſhall be, who upholdeth and governeth all things by his power, and having purged our ſins, is now ſet at the right hand of God, being made ſo much better than the Angels, as hee hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they, there being now no hope of any thing more noble and glorious than this law-giver.
               
               Upon the ſame occaſion Chriſtians may remember that the weapons of Chriſt and of their

                  Chriſtian warfare, are not ſuch as Mahumet uſed, but ſpirituall, able to caſt downe ſtrong holds, and every thing that exaſteth it ſelfe againſt the knowledge of God. For our bukler, we have the ſhield of faith, whereby wee may withſtand the fiery darts of the devill: For a breſt-plate wee muſt have righteouſneſſe or integrity of life: The hope of eternall ſalvation is a helmet, which may cover the weakeſt part: And the word of God is a ſword, that pierceth into the moſt inward parts of the ſoule.
               
               After all this followes the exhortation to mutuall concord, which Chriſt at his departure ſo ſolemnly, and with ſuch earneſtneſſe commended unto his Diſciples. There ought not to be many Maſters and Doctors amongſt us, but we muſt have one Maſter, even Ieſus Chriſt. All Chriſtians are baptized unto one name, wherefore it is expedient that

there bee no ſe
                        •
                     ls or diviſions among them: for the cure and remedy of which evils, if any ſuch ariſe, wee have divers Apoſtolicall ſayings worthy to bee obſerved and practiſed; as, let no man thinke more highly of himſelfe than hee ought to thinke; but let men be wiſe with ſobriety, according as God hath dealt to every man the meaſure of faith. If any doe not ſo well conceive and rightly underſtand all things as they ought, then their weak
                        •
                     eſſe muſt be born with, that ſo with out all jarring aſperi
                        •
                     y they may be united and knit together with us after a moſt ſweet, calme and milde manner. If any doe excell the reſt in underſtanding; it is but meet alſo that they ſurpaſſe them in love, in holy affection and good endevours. And as for thoſe that in ſome points are of different opinion from ſuch as hold the truth, Gods leaſure muſt bee waited

for, untill it pleaſe him to reveale the ſame truth, that yet lies hid from them: and in the meane while thoſe things which are agreed upon, muſt be ſtedfaſtly kept and duly practiſed.
               We know now in part onely, but the time ſhall come when all things ſhall be known moſt plainly and after a perſpicuous manner. For the preſent let every one be intreated and perſwaded unto this; namely, that they doe not unprofitably occupy or hoord up the talent comitted to them upon truſt, but that they endevour by all meanes poſſible to win others unto Chriſt. For wch purpoſe we muſt not onely uſe good languages and wholeſome ſpeeches, but alſo the example of good life; that ſo the goodneſſe of our maſter may appeare by us his ſervants, and the integrity of the law by our laudable actions,
               
               Laſtly, our ſpeech returning

unto valgar readers, intreateth them, that if hereby they reape any good, they would give thanks to God for it. But if otherwiſe any thing ſeeme diſtaſtefull, let them impute it partly to the common infirmity of mans nature, that is prone to errour; and partly to the time and place wherein this worke was rather haſtily compoſed than diligently plyed.
