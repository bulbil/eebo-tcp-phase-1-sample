            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

all increaſe of skill,
Succeſſe and
Valour.
            
            
               AS the Saints
were not after
the fleſh,
ſo the weapons
of their warfare
are not carnall, but
mighty through God,
to bring downe all the

ſtrong holds and mighty
imaginations of divels
and men, plotted
cunningly againſt the
Iſraelites of God; yea,
all the forces of the
fleſh and the world
muſt faint, and fly upon
the uſe of theſe
Armes. Of this compleate
glorious Armature,
Prayer is a ſpeciall
part; yea, it is the
very evergetical manifeſtatiō
of the powof
all the reſt. Jt putteth
on all the other
parts, it keepeth the

whole armature cloſe
to a man, it ſanctifieth
all the reſt to their ſeveral
uſes it guardeth
all the reſt of the golden
furniture from
theeves and robbers,
it daunteth the Divell
and the Divels limbs,
it carrieth the armed
Souldier through out
all forces and furies,
as a victorious Conquerour.
And hence
is that ſaying of the
Ancients, Supplications
and Teares are the
Armes of the Saints. As

the power and excellency
of this ſpirituall
peece is unexpreſſible,
by tongues of men
or Angels; ſo am I the
leaſt of all to be called,
of ſo high &amp; heavenly
a faculty; but
ſince it hath pleaſed
him that hath mercy
on mee to teach mee
the uſe of it, (though
in much weakneſſe,)
and to guide mee as a
weake penſill in his
draught of the truth
of it, to whom ſhould
J then commend it

both for the Touch &amp;
Tuition, but to the
Military Forces of the
new Hieruſalem, who
are experimētally acquainted

peece of proofe? To
you then my deare &amp;

Band of heaven, the

bear with the feebleneſſe

Lay about you with

good commodity to

            TO
THE READER
            
               AS there was never
more ſleight
in venting bad
commodities under
falſe gloſſes, nor never
more falſehood in counterfeiting
of coine, to make it
goe currant, then in theſe
our daies, ſo never more
cheating tricks in the venting
of ſhews and ſhapes of
holy performances, under
the colour of true and eſſentiall
duties, in this ſelfe-coſening
age of ours: Inſtance
in this duty of prayer,
under the ſhadowes and

ſhew whereof, the Divell
masketh himſelf even as an
Angell of light: All that
are of any religion wil ſeem
to pray, but a few pray indeed.
It is an eaſie thing
under the meanes (eſpecially
of quick wits,) to drawe
a faire picture or dumbe
ſhew of prayer; but the Spirit
only can make a living
prayer. As nothing is liker
true friendſhip then flattery,
ſo nothing liker Piety
then Hypocriſie: nothing
liker Prayer then painted
words; but words without
quickning power of the
Spirit are no prayer at all.
All that are of any knowledge
within the pale of the
Church, will acknowledge
the indigeſted prayer of the

brutiſh ignorant, to be but
babling, and alſo the prayers
of ſuch as worſhip a
ſtrange God, or the true God
after a falſe manner, to bee
but ſin but that a man may
have fit wordes, a fluent
phraſe, patheticall expreſſions,
yet no prayer, that
ſeemeth a Paradox: but that
ſo it may be I have ſhewed
at large in this Treatiſe,
wherein I have endeavoured
to cleare by proper and
diſtinct notes the true Being
of Prayer from all Semblances
of prayer. And
where the comfort in prayer
ariſeth from the ſenſe of
the ſpirit in prayer, I have
delivered (as I may) the
meanes of attaining the
ſenſe of the Spirit, together

with incouragements and
motives to goe on in prayer
though ſenſe be not preſent.
And laſtly I give directions,
how they that want the
Spirit of ſupplication, ſhall
labour for it. Though my
inſufficiency in every particular
may appeare to an
Artiſt in the faculty, yet, to
Gods glory bee it ſpoken, I
have gone along by the
light and feeling of ſome
ſparkles of the Spirit, but
with matter of much ſorrow,
for my ſhallowneſſe in
the duty. Take heed then,
Chriſtian Reader, how thou
prayeſt, for it is Sathans
main impoſture to get thy
heart to deceiue thee in this
duty, which is the lock and
key of all other duties; read

and conſider, impute the
failings to me, and give
God the Glory if any thing
pleaſeth.
            
               Yours to uſe in Chriſt,

               1. What Prayer is.
               
                  AS there is no evill
of ſinne,The excellency and neceſſity of Praier: nor
plague of puniſhment,
more
feareful &amp; dangerous then
the Spirit of ſlumber;Iſay 29. 10 ſo
there is no better preſervation
againſt it,Rom. 12. 8. and medicine
for the cure of it,
then the Spirit of Prayer.
The best of Gods people

are taken with ſome dregs
of this.
               
                  I ſleepe (ſaith the ſpouſe)
but my heart waketh:
                  Cant. 5. 2. All
had need therefore to be
awaked, and there is no
better meanes to awake
us, then to hear God ſpeaking
to us, and to ſet our
ſelves a talking to God.
Theſe be the two meanes
indeed that abandon all
that breake off familiarity
with God, and
keepe and increaſe acquaintance
with God; let
that counſell of our Saviour
ever be with us,
watch and pray. It is the
beſt meanes for watchmen
to keepe themſelves
awake by talking, and ſo
rouſe their Spirits by conference.

This Prayer is
the beſt medicine, the ſafeſt
refuge, the trueſt meſſenger,
and the moſt
mighty prevailer with
God.
               To ſtirre us up then to
ſo excellent and neceſſary
a duty, in ſo dangerous,
ſecure, and backſliding
time, I have made bold to
hang out a litle light, that
they that have erred from
the way (as who doth
not) may returne, they
that are in the way may
goe on with comfort, and
they that never came into
the way (who yet ſuppoſe
themſelves to be in the
way) may, if it be poſſible,
be brought into the
way.
               
                  
For Method and memories
ſake, the ſubject
of this litle Treatiſe, containes
in it, or divideth it
ſelfe into theſe particulars.
               In the firſt, there is a
deſcription of Prayer.
               In the ſecond, are diſcovered
the marks of the
Spirit of Prayer.
               The third directeth us
how to attaine to the
ſence of the Spirit of Praier.
               The fourth ſheweth
how a man ſhould hold
on the duty of Prayer
without the ſence of the
Spirit.
               The fift and laſt directeth
men that want the
Spirit of Prayer how to

labour for it: Of theſe and
of their proper particulars
in order, and firſt,
briefly of the firſt, becauſe
the manner of true Prayer
doth diſcover fully the
nature of Prayer.
               
                  The School-men,
                  Deſcription of Praier. 
                  and
Fathers have diverſe Deſcriptions;
in which for
me to be curious, ſtandeth
neither with the nature of
the Treatiſe, nor with the
ſcope or my intent: And
for my owne part as one
ſaid in another caſe, I had
rather pray powerfully then
define Prayer accurately:
The ſumme of all theſe;
The ſumme of all Deſcriptions,
may be compriſed
in this, namely, That Praier
is a ſpirituall Ability infuſed

into the heart, whereby
the ſoule expreſſeth it
ſelfe familiarly and immediately
to God, in the name
of Ieſus Christ, with confidence
in the promiſes. It is
called by ſome the pious
affection of the ſpeaker to
God;Auguſt. Hom. 
                  by others the manifeſtation
of the heart to God,
and the aſſent of the ſoul to
God. This definitiō is made
good by diverſe places of
the Scripture compared
together:
                  Rom. 8. 26. 16. 
                  Firſt, the Spirit
maketh interceſsion for us
with Groans: Secondly, the
heart is the ſeate &amp;c.
               
                  Lord before thee is all
my deſire,
                  Pſal. 38. 10. 65. 3. 
                  and my ſighing
is not hid from thee: This
muſt be done immediately
to God; for thou that

heareſt Prayers (ſaith the
Pſalmiſt) unto thee ſhal all
fleſh come, and that in the
Name of Chriſt.Ioh. 5. 14. 
                  If yee
aske any thing in my
name I will doe it; Neither
doth Chriſt his Mediatourſhip
make ours
not to be immediate; for
he is God as well as man,
and is appointed our Mediatour,
as the place quoted
teſtifieth, I will doe
it. Laſtly with confidence
in the promiſes, and this is
the confidence that we have
in him,
                  Ioh. 5. 14 
                  that if wee aske any
thing according to his will
he heareth us.
               
               Firſt, that Prayer is not
an naturall acquired ability.
               Secondly, it cōſiſteth not

in words though they be
ornat, or well ſet forth
with ſeeming holyneſſe,
but in the powring out of
the heart, by ſighes and
groanes inexpreſſible.
               Thirdly, It is no Prayer
at all that is not made
in and by Chriſt.
               Fourthly &amp; Laſtly, without
faith it is impoſſible
to pray: Of theſe Concluſions
more fully in the ſecond
particular, to which
now I proceed.
            
            
               
               2 How a man may know
when hee prayeth in the
Spirit.
               
                  AS Prayer is
the ſpecial gift
of God; ſo all
men have it
not that can
talk well, or that ſeeme to
have it;Ioel, 2. 28. 
                  I will poure out my
Spirit (ſaith the Lord) upon
all fleſh; that is, upon
all his own; he promiſeth
no ſuch thing to the wicked.
Pray alwaies,
                  Epheſ. 6. 18. ſaith
the Apoſtle: Try we therefore,
whether wee have
this or not, for good
words except they be the
words of the Spirit, will
not ſerve. Would you

then know whether you
pray by the Spirit or no,
try your Prayer by theſe
particular evidences.
               The firſt evidence of
the Spirit of Praier is our
Adoption,Evidences of praying in the Spirit. 1. Is Adoption. or Sonſhip,
wherein wee are interreſted.
Baſtards and ſtrangers,
yea, meere ſervants
cannot pray; they learne
not, nay cannot learne the
language of the houſe, as
children can doe; they cal
not upon God; they may
get ſome broken language,
or termes of Art
wherewithall to ſerve
their neceſſities, as for
meat, prefentment and eſteeme
among Gods people;
yea, for ſome words
they may come to be admired,

but in the true pronounciation
of Shiboleth
they are to ſeeke, and ſo
they come ſhort of that
language: But the ſonnes
and daughters, be they
never ſo weake, yea, but
babes or Infants in Chriſt,
yet they can ſpeake the
language of their Father
truly, though not
througly, nor eloquently.
All this the Apoſtle proveth
in that Phraſe to the
Romans:
                  Rom. 8. 15. 
                  Yee have received
the Spirit of Adoption
whereby yee cry Abba Father:
Where obſerve,
firſt, who cryeth, namely
Sonnes, and they only:
Secondly what they cry,
namely Father, which if
they can ſpeake truly, if

with litle children, they
can ſay litle more, yet
they pray truly, ſpeaking
the language of the Spirit.
               A ſecond note that one
prayeth by the Spirit,2 A deſire and endeavour of the preſence of the Spirit. is
an earneſt deſire and endeavour
to take the Spirit
along with them: They
will not goe willingly
without the evidence of
the Spirit; witneſſe the
ſame Apoſtle; the Spirit
maketh requeſt for us:
Where wee muſt underſtand
that the Spirit is
ſaid to make requeſt for us
after an other manner,
then the ſonne is ſaid to
make requeſt for us. v. 34.
namely by the vertue and
power of his merit: But

the Spirit maketh requeſt
by ſtirring us up, and putting
us on to make requeſt.
The Spirit (as one
ſaith) by that annointing
power teacheth and frameth
us to frame our petitions.
In this wee muſt be
like Moſes,
                  Exod. 33. 45. 
                  If the Lords
preſence goe not with us
let us not goe from hence.
               
               The beſt of Hypocrites
can be content to have an
Angell goe before them,
give the Angellicall ſtile,
cōming from lips touched
with a coale of ſtrange
fire, moved by no internall
principle, except it
be from ſome common
gift at the beſt, it is enough,
and in this they
pleaſe themſelves, and

gaine admiration from others;
but their praiſe is
but of men and not of God;
but this will not ſerve
the children of Prayer;
they will not ſtirre without
the Spirit of their Father,
neither can they doe
it:Rom. 8. 26. 
                  Wee know not (ſaith the
Apoſtle) what to pray as
we ought: we have neither
thought to conceive, nor
will to conſent, nor art to
perfect of our ſelves. As
the Spirit of God did
move or flutter upon the
waters for the inclining
of that vaſt body, by a
powerfull and procreative
heate, ſo the heate of
Gods Spirit muſt either
quicken us to the duty, or
wee, and it are no better

then a deed Carcaſſe, or at
the faireſt but like a ſpecious
Picture. The people
of God doe now and then
neglect (I muſt confeſſe)
this duty, the taking their
guide with them; they
weigh not ſo attentively,
nor watch ſo ſeriouſly after
this firſt mover, as
they ſhould: As a man
forgetteth to ſet his
watch, or to take his guide
with him. And this is a
main cauſe why they ſeek
and find not; yea, why
they walke not in the
ſtrength of the Spirit. Againe
the people of God
may be without the ſence
and feeling of the Spirit,
&amp; yet the Spirit be there,
they not being aware:

howſoever they are very
ſenſible of their inſenſibility,
and much humbled
for their neglect.
               The third evidence3 A ſenſibility of our owne inability.
that we pray by the Spirit
is a ſenſibility of our
owne inability: As the
Spirit helpeth our infirmities,
ſo it diſcovereth
the infirmity of the underſtanding,
the will, the
memory, the affections;
yea, the Spirit diſcovereth▪
all indiſpoſition,
ſloathfulneſſe, impatiency,
inconſtancy, and too
much making haſt, fleſh
and blood cannot diſcover
theſe: Indeed fleſh &amp;
blood will diſcover want
of readineſſe, or of an outward
frame of words, or

for want of ſome ſupernaturall
heate to inliven
the outward action, which
the hypocrite may take
for the true heate of the
Spirit; but the want of
that coeleſtiall heate, or
true quickning motion of
the Spirit, it neither diſcovereth
nor bewaileth:
But the godly out of
knowledge of theſe infirmities,
are exceeding
humbled, whereupon
there is roome made
for the Spirit to reſt in,
for repairing of thoſe ruines;
yea, the child of God
by the knowledg of theſe
his wants, commeth to
ſpeed beſt, when in his
owne conceipt he prayeth
worſt, yea, when he can

ſay nothing with Moſes,
and is to himſelfe as it
were breathleſſe, and
ſpeechleſſe, yet out of the
ſenſibility of his prolixity
he cryeth hardeſt of all,
and God is nigheſt to
him, when he conceiveth
him to be fartheſt off: If
then thou findeſt or feeleſt
not in Prayer that
comfort that thy heart
deſireth, be not diſcouraged,
but rather comfort
thy ſelfe, upon the feeling
of thy wants, and humiliation
for them, becauſe it
is a worke of the Spirit;
goe on then, and rather
then thou pray not at all,
caſt thy ſelfe before the
Lord, look up to heaven,
if thou canſt but cry like a

litle child, ceaſe not till
thou make the Echo of
the Rock to reſound.
               The fourth evidence of
the guidance of the Spirit,4 Helpe againſt infirmities.
is a ſenſible helping of
us in ſome meaſure againſt
the aforeſaid infirmities
of Vnderſtanding, Will,
Memory, and Affections.Rom. 8. 26
                  The Spirit helpeth our infirmities:
It teacheth for
what and how to pray:
It ſtrengthneth memory
with motives,Memory and Vnderſtanding. out of the
which the underſtanding
frameth arguments, as
judgments, mercies, precepts,
promiſes, renuedneſſe,
ranking every one
in his due place, and cauſing
the ſoule to pick ſome
good out of of every one

of them. So the Spirit
bringeth the wil in Praier
contrary to its diſpoſition
to be ſubject to the Will
of God, and to make
choice of that which God
willeth as the very beſt:
in this our Saviour Chriſt
is a perfect patterne, in
his heavy and dreadfull
conflict, ſaying often and
againe:Mat. 26. 39. 
                  Not as I will but as
thou wilt Father. The Spirit
doth not only correct
and change the averſeneſſe,
and deadneſſe of the
affections, as feare, love,
joy, and ſorrow, but it ſets
them on with a high and
heavenly temper upon
their proper objects; As
that the ſoule in Prayer,
ſhould love nothing in

compariſon of God, and
his countenance; hate nothing
ſo much (no not the
Divell or Hell it ſelfe) as
his owne ſinne, grieve, at
nothing ſo much as the
grieving of God; fear nothing
as the God of his
feare.
               Laſtly the Spirit helpeth
the ſtupidity and benummedneſſe
of the conſcience,Conſcience.
making it tender
and pliable, and alſo impartiall
in the applying
home of the particulars
to the preſent ſeate of the
ſoule, which is the proper
function of the conſcience:
As for inſtance, it either
excuſeth by application
of mercy, the fruit
whereof is preſent peace;

or accuſeth by application
of Iudgment, the preſent
fruit whereof is trouble
and terror: yet it bringeth
forth and begetteth
the quiet fruit of righteouſneſſe;
for upon the
judging of our ſelves by
the afflicting of our ſelves,
God ceaſeth to judge us.
Try then what helpe thou
findeſt of the Spirit, in
ſtrengthning thy weakneſſe
in the ſeeking of his
face; for aſſuredly wee all
find the leſſe helpe for
want of this triall.
               But ſome will ſay, wee
find no helpe at all;Objection. Our
underſtanding is darker,
our memories weaker,
our wills more perverſe,
our affections deader, our

conſciences heavier then
ever they were.
               I anſwer,Anſwer 1. firſt there
may be a neglect of the
triall of the performance
by the ſeverall notes, and
alſo ſuch a careleſſeneſſe,
to walke by the rule of
Prayer, that the duty is
fallen into a cuſtome; ſo
that, becauſe we look not
to take the Spirit along
with us, and caſt not our
ſelves, and the duty upon
the helpe of it, we come to
want the helpe thereof
when we would, becauſe
we looked not for it when
we ſhould.
               Againe, it may be anſwered
for ſome, that
ſence is no true Iudge: For
as ſome may conceive of

help from the Spirit, that
never had any, and conceipt
of ſound and well
ordered parts in Prayer,
that have nothing but rottenneſſe
in their inward
parts (for all their painted
oratory &amp; glozing words)
ſo ſome may be unſenſible
of the aforeſaid helpe
for ſome miſtakings, or
ſome diſorder in the
courſe, yea, by Gods hiding
his preſence, of ſence,
and yet he helped mightily
by God: which may be
inſtanced and proved by
theſe two particulars.
               Firſt, the ſence of thoſe
infirmities in Prayer, is
the worke and evidence
of a praying Spirit;
               Secondly, the going on

with ſighes and groanes,
under the burden of theſe
infirmities is word for
word, to take us up (as it
were by the hand) and to
goe with us againſt our
infirmities. If the ſpirit in
theſe two be with us, it is
not want of ſenſe that can
nullifie his preſence. Eliſha's
ſervant, while his
eies were ſhut could not
ſee the armies of the Lord,
but his eyes being open
he ſaw clearely that there
were more with him then
againſt him: So let the
ſoule of ſuch goe on, and
wait upon the Lord, without
cenſuring the Lords
work for want of feeling;
and let them for their
better ſtay, view and try

all the points of the evidence,
for if one hold, all
the reſt will in ſome meaſure
make for them.
               Yea but others will
ſay they are ſo farre from
help againſt their infirmities,2 Ob.
that the infirmities of
earthly and idle thoughts
doe ſtrive into the very
duty, whereby the worke
of the Spirit (for the time)
is quenched, the ſoul beaten
off, and the heart ſtoln
away.
               For anſwer,Anſwer I muſt confeſſe
it is a ſhrewd incounter,
and a dangerous infirmity
ariſing out of the
looſeneſſe of the heart,
the atheiſme of the mind,
the deadneſſe of the conſcience,
the corruption of

the memory and earthly
condition of the affections;
whereby wee let ſlip
&amp; forget with whom we
have to deale, and what
we have to doe: Here is
want of devotion &amp; want
of attention.Bern. de medit. 6. 8. 
                  It is mad folly
(ſaith one) to thy ſelfe,
&amp; great iniury to another,
when thou wilt neither attend
him nor look to thy
ſelfe; yet for all this it is
no other temptation but
ſuch as may and doth overtake
the children of
God: but with this difference
from that vagrancy
in the hearts of the unregenerate
men be they never
ſo ſmooth: Firſt the
ſame ſpirit whoſe worke
for a time recoileth, at

length like a great &amp; ſole
conquering commander,
routs all thoſe rebellious
thoughts,How the godly are troubled with idle thoughts in prayer. yea and taking
them on a ſudden, reſerveth
them in chaines for
execution; then he brings
up, or rather beateth up
theſe diſordered forces or
faculties of the ſoul with
ſorrow &amp; ſhame enough
to their neglected ſervice;
which ſervice being done
then hee ſheweth them
what baſe ſlaves had cauſed
them to recoile from
ſo glorious and gainfull a
ſervice of ſo great a God;
what a commander they
had forſaken; and what
dangerous and ſhamefull
hazard they had brought
themſelves into; at the

conſideration whereof,
their hearts ſmite them,
they abhorre their owne
ſoules, they weep bitterly
till they leave a Bochino or
place of weeping behinde
them to ſet their feet upō
their necks, and doe execution
upon thoſe ſlaviſh
Canaanites, to whom they
had ſhamefully inſlaved
thēſelves; which I doubt
not but many have a care
to doe; yet when they
have done all they can,
ſome will eſcape in a corner,
ſtarting out now and
then to doe them a miſchiefe
at unawares: As
they pray therefore, ſo let
them watch.
               But with the unregenerate
man it is nothing ſo:How it is with the unregenerate.
                  
for hee can draw nigh to
God with his lips, but
keep his heart far enough
off, and yet his heart never
ſmiteth him: hee is
content to have a Dove in
his hand, and a Hog in his
heart; thought is free
with him; and that is the
mark of a ſlave: It is one
thing to let Traitors and
plaguie Rogues in at
doores by negligence, &amp;
ſo to bee troubled with
getting them out, and another
thing to keep open
houſe for them. The fayreſt
ſun-ſhine may bee over-clouded,
but darknes
it ſelfe can never be light:
As for the interpoſition
of Sathans ſuggeſtions,
let that be ſet on Sathans
ſcore.
               
                  
Laſt of all,3 Ob. ſome will
ſay, they are ſo far from
the aid and aſſiſtance of
the ſpirit in prayer, that
they neither can pray, nor
dare pray, nor have they
any minde to pray; can
thoſe bee the children of
God?
               I anſwer,Anſwer though they
bee in an exceeding great
ſtrait, yet they may bee
Gods children for al that;
for though they cannot,
neither dare pray, yet they
deſire to pray: &amp; though
they have no deſire, yet
they wiſh they might deſire.
But we muſt learn to
diſtinguiſh between parties
in a due temper both
of body and ſoule, and
themſelves diſtempered

in one or both: ſometimes,
through the diſtemper
of black fumes of melancholy,
the imagination
is corrupt, ſometimes the
conſcience is wounded
with the ſenſe of ſin, the
want of grace, or with the
trouble of ſome blaſphemous
or wicked thoughts
ſometimes the Lord is
pulling a ſinner as a brand
out of the fire, leaveth
ſparkles of his terrible
wrath in him, for his
greater humiliatiō, ſometimes
the Lord may ſeal
the heart and cloſe up the
mouth for the trial of the
party himſelfe, the example
of others, and the manifeſtation
of his owne
power, in keeping of thē
                  
in that caſe, and his mercy
in the inlarging of their
hearts according to the
time of reſtraint. In all
theſe caſes the ſoule may
be clear of the things, the
exerciſe of prayer barred,
and yet the ſpirit of prayer
remain; which may be
evidenced by the fruits of
the ſpirit which are a tenderneſſe
of conſcience, a
hatred of ſin, love to the
Saints, and obedience to
God. So much for the
fourth note, wherein I
have been the larger by
reaſon of the power of
the ſpirit herein.
               The fift evidence of
Prayer made by the ſpirit,5. Fervency of ſpirit
is that ſpirituall vigor or
fervency of it, which as a

conſuming fire from heaven,
cauſeth the odours of
the prayers of the Saints
to aſcend like incenſe: To
this effect is that of the
Apoſtle,Rom. 8. 26. 
                  The ſpirit maketh
request for vs with
grones that cannot bee expreſſed:
By theſe unpreſsible
grones, is meant the vehemency
or fervency of
Prayer, being the work of
the ſpirit, which worketh
after an unſpeakable maner
in the hearts of all that
pray;Gen. 32. 28. this is that wreſtling
that prevaileth with
God;Exod. 32. 10. this is that which
ſtirreth up a man to lay
hold on God;
                  Iſay 64. 7. Can. 3. 4. this is that
which layeth violent hold
on him whom the ſoule loveth;
This was the practice

of our Saviour
Chriſt,Heb. 6. 4. 
                  who in the daies of
his fleſh offered up prayers
and ſupplications with
strong cryes and teares:
Againſt this his own practice
Chriſt cannot ſtand
out; witneſſe that parable
of the importunate prevailing
widow;Luke 18. 4. 7. and ſhall
not God revenge his elect
that cry day &amp; night?
The want of this wrongeth
Gods cauſe, maketh
the enimie prevaile, and
our prayers to be forceles
and fruitleſſe, yea our
courſes uncomfortable;
whereas on the fervency
of prayer all the contrary
effects attend. This fervency
was Luthers excellency,
and in this hee and

many others found moſt
good: This ſmiteth and
overturneth both the inward
&amp; outward Amalakite.
If thou wilt ſacrifice,
take fire with thee; the
want whereof may juſtly
invert the ſaying of Abraham
to thy diſadvantage;
here is the ſacrifice but
whereis the fire. The golden
Cenſer receiveth no
Odours without fire,
more or leſſe to conſume
them, and according to
the height or lowneſſe of
the fire, the motion of
prayer is the ſwifter or
flower. The lazie, cold, &amp;
frozen prayer prevaileth
nothing with God, but by
weeping and making earneſt
ſupplication, we may

finde God in Bethel,
                  Hoſ. 12. 4. and
ſpeak to God, and prevail
with God, as Iacob did.
               
                  Let us then (as Paul
ſaith) labour fervently in
prayer,
                  Col. 4. 12. that the power
thereof may bee an evidence
of the ſpirit in us;
but herein wee muſt take
heed of the deceitfulneſſe
of ſtrange fire in the heart;
for as a burning feaver, or
the fit of an intermitting
Ague, or a hecktick diſpoſition,
may manifeſt
more heat outwardly to
the touch, yea inflame the
inward parts with more
ardency, or ſcorching &amp;
conſuming heat, begetting
an unquenchable thirſt
by drinking up the radical
moiſture of the Spirits,

then is to bee felt in a due
temperature; So a feveriſh
heat, or counterfeit zeale,
may exalt an hypocrite
high in the outward action,
yea he may have a deceiving
taſt of the power
of God, &amp; ſeeming thirſt
of the glory of God, and a
prepoſterous deſire of
honour and immortality,
yea all this may be like to
the former heat and thirſt
in nature, an unnaturall &amp;
adventitious heat, not
truly inlivening &amp; maintaining
the life of prayer,
but conſuming and devouring
the ſuppoſed ſpirit
of prayer. Of theſe
two if you deſire to know
the eſſentiall difference, I
take it to conſiſt in theſe
particulars.
               
                  
Firſt,The difference of true fervē
                     cy &amp; counter feit in prayer. 1 Difference. this fervency is a
ſanctifying &amp; ſaving fruit
of the ſpirit, wrought immediatly
in the heart and
affections, whereby the
underſtanding faculties
are much ſublimated and
refined, whereon followeth
a more pure conception,
with a ſwifter &amp; directer
motion of prayer;
becauſe both heart and
underſtanding are quickned
and agitated by true
celeſtiall heat. Neither
muſt you conceive that
the fervency of affection
muſt carry the underſtanding
without information
from it: this were zeal
without knowledge; wch
the ſpirit peremptorily
condemneth: but this ſacred

fire of fervency cleareth
the clouds of the underſtanding:
ſo that the
formes of divine motions
are more quickly and purely
framed in the paſsive
faculty thereof, and are
more ſoundly and judicially
wrought on by the
active faculty, ſo the fire
be compact: ſo that you
ſee this fire is of a heavenly
operation and from
heaven; well may it bee
compared with that divine
fire which came out
from before Iehovah and
conſumed the burnt offering
upon the Altar: But
the ſtrange fire in the ſeeming
zealous hypocrite
is nothing like; for firſt it
is but a ſupernaturall cō
                  mon

gift of the ſpirit at
the moſt; againe, it is rather
an inflāmation of the
brain, ariſing from the
rapture of ſome vainglorious
conceipt, deceiving
the heart, and running all
along like a devouring
wild-fire, rather (I ſay)
then any true fire, warming
and quickning the
life of ſupplication.
               Secondly,2 Difference. this true celeſtiall
fire hath no fuell
but the ſpirit, but the
ſtrange fire hath either
private injury or publike
applauſe for the fuell.
               Thirdly,3 Difference. this true fire
hath for the end or object,
Gods glory and the
ſalvation of thoſe that are
heated with it, cōſuming

every thing that ſtands in
the way of either of theſe.
The ſpouſe ſpeaking of
the nature of this zeale,Cant. 8. 6.
telleth us, that the coales
thereof are coales of fire,
which hath a moſt vehement
flame: Of this David
ſaith,Pſal. 96. 10. 119. 13. 
                  the zeale of thy
houſe hath eaten me up, and
in another place, my zeale
hath conſumed me, or ſuppreſſeth
me, becauſe mine
enimies have forgotten
thy words: But counterfeit
zeale in prayer hath
for its end or object, the
raviſhing of mens conceipts,
the glory of applauſe,
the gaining of
ſome worldly commodity;
ſo far as the ſun ſhine
of Gods glory is adored

by the times and ſtate, ſo
much will hypocriſie
ſeem to advance it: like
cloudes, they will follow
the Sun, and ſeem to carry
Gods glory right on
before them, but when
the current croſſeth it
they goe no further with
it, but like a running
hound, they caſt up, and
with an open mouth they
run another way.
               Fourthly,4 Difference. this true fire
though it ſet all on fire
within and without, and
turneth all that it toucheth
into the nature of fire,
carrying all upward with
it according to the proportiō
of fire; yet it humbleth
the ſoul exceedingly,
and maketh it vile in

its own eyes: for by this
true fervency, the ſtubble
and rubbiſh of mens corruptions,
and interpoſition
being removed and
conſumed, Gods excellē
                  cy
&amp; mans meanes, Gods
mercy and mans miſery
the more appeareth,
which be the meanes and
motives of mans humiliatiō.
But with the ſtrange
fire-workmen it is not ſo;
for as Cookes by unnaturall
heat of the fire extinguiſhing
the naturall heat,
and exhauſting the radicall
moiſture, and by exceſſe
of drinking become
hydropicks; ſo theſe are
puffed up with a ſwelling
conceipt of themſelves,
by the unnaturall or adventitious

heat of this
ſtrange fire; crying in effect
with Iehu, come with
me and ſee my zeale for the
Lord;
                  2. King. 10 16. yea if theſe counterfeits
of true zeal be not
admired, they are all off
the hinges, they count
their charges and paines
to be loſt: Their zeale is
like to the vertues of the
Heathens, from which, if
you ſeparate (as one ſaith)
the ſplendor of glory,
                  Saluſt. ad Caeſar. 
                  vertue
it ſelfe will goe bitter
to them: So take from the
zeal of ſeeming zealous
Hypocrites, the ſwelling
cloud of puffing up applauſe,
their fervency falleth
preſently into an atrophie
or pining away
under abūdance of means;

ſo that their pride not
maintained with applauſe
either like a handfull of
gun-powder carrieth fire
and fuell and all that lieth
in the way out of the
chimney top, or like a
dropſie by peecemeale it
conſumeth the naturall
heat, and drinketh up the
radicall moiſture: But the
heat of the truly zealous
is like the harth of the Altar,
hallowed by humility,
for the receit of Gods
fire, and for the keeping
and increaſing of the heat
thereof.
               Fiftly and laſtly,5 Difference. the
true fire of fervency is never
extinguiſhed, it is for
divers cauſes more intenſe
or remiſſe, higher or

lower in the beſt of Gods
children; yea the ſparkles
may lye very low overlaid
with aſhes; notwithſtanding
it is true fire,
though it be never ſo litle
or never ſo weake in nature;
alwaies like the fire
upon the Altar which burneth
continually,
                  Numb. 6. 12. 13. and ſhall
not bee put out; to the
which the ſpirit affordeth
the fuell, ſtirring &amp; blowing
it up for the conſuming
of the ſacrifice: But
the ſtrange fire is but a
flaſh, quickly out and unorderly
kindled, like a fit
of an Ephemera, or diary
feaver, and is as quickly
extinguiſhed either by the
oyle of proſperity, or by
the water of adverſity,

yea like a rotten, ſulphurous,
fiery ſquib, it cracks
and flaſhes, ſtinks and dieth.
Let every ſoule examine
its own fervency in
prayer by the particulars,
by which examination if
they can finde in the leaſt
meaſure, theſe notes of
fervency, they may aſſure
themſelves to their exceeding
great comfort that
they can pray in the holy
Ghoſt.
               But ſome diſtreſſed
ſoule will ſay,Ob. they can
finde no life of fervency
in their prayers, they are
takē in the duty with ſyncopes,
or many fainting
and ſounding fits of the
heart, many a cold ſweat
goeth over them, they are

taken with many Lethargies
of the underſtanding,
mad melancholy aberiations
in the imagination,
much forgetfulneſſe in the
memory, yea, with a cold
aſtoniſhing ſtupefaction
of the whole man; what
fire of the Spirit can be
here? Surely (ſay they)
none at all.
               Conclude not ſo,Anſ. 1. for
true fire may be raked up
in the aſhes of neglect or
diſtemper, though it doe
not appeare.
               Againe, the ſence and
ſorrow of and for the overſwaying
ſuppreſſmēts
muſt needs ariſe from the
light and heat of true fire,
be it never ſo weake or litle;
for the common gifts

and moſt glorious excellency
in counterfeit Prayer,
cannot truly and ingeniouſly
diſcover an eſſentiall
defect in Prayer.
               Againe, the ſparkles of
life that the moſt diſtreſſed
and daunted of Gods
people finde in Prayer,
now and then make the
ſtrongeſt kind of demonſtration,
that the Fire of
Gods Spirit inlivens their
Prayer: For where there
is action, there is life, and
where is life there is heat;
for life conſiſteth in heat:
As the Spirit of faith in
the Diſciples was very
weake when they counted
the relation of the Reſurrection
but as an idle tale;
                  Luk. 24. 11. 32. 34. ſo
that they would not believe

it, yet the Spirit of
faith was not extinguiſhed,
witneſſe the burning
of their hearts within them
while he talked with them
in the way to Emaus, which
aroſe from the quickning
of the Spirit, which lay as
it were quenched in them;
even ſo the fervency of
the Spirit of Prayer, may
ſeeme to be quenched, &amp;
yet the flames burſting
out now and then, in ſighs
and Groanes that cannot
be expreſſed, argueth heavenly
fire to inſpire thy
Prayer, howſoever thou
wilt not be perſwaded of
it.
               Laſtly, obſerve thy earneſt
deſire of fervency &amp;
ſtriving endeavour to goe

on, though thou feeleſt
but litle or no comfort;
theſe be true flames of
the Spirit, which were never
kindled in the leaſt
meaſure in the breaſt of
any Hypocrite: will an
Hypocrite with all his
painted flames hold out?
No, they will murmure
if God heare them not;
but the godly will truſt
in him though hee ſlay
them.
                  Iſay 58. 2. 3. Let every one then
ſtirre up the gift that is in
him, whatſoever it be, and
the Lord will be with us ere
we be aware.
                  Iob. 13. 15
               
               The ſixt evidence of
the Spirit of Prayer,6 the train of all graces accompaning. is
that godly traine of allſaving
graces garding it,
ſtrengthning it, and attending

upon it, Hee that can
doe an errand to God is deſtitute
of no gift,
                  1 Cor. 1. 7. as Paul
ſaith of the Corinthians:
that Embaſsie is guarded
with all the graces of
God in ſome meaſure, as
firſt it ariſeth from that
impregnable pallace of
faith, which aſcendeth
like a Cloud with Prayer
in it, never ceaſing, but ſtill
increaſing the motion, till
it come to heaven. In, and
from this Pallace, Prayer
is armed with an irreſiſtible
violence, and commeth
forth like a valiant
Champion, beating all
down-right before it that
ſtandeth between God &amp;
it; Innumerable inſtances
of this in Gods ſervants

put that immediate principle
of the Spirit out of
all Queſtion: Whatſoever
yee ſhall aske in Prayer,
                  Mat. 21. 22. 
                  believing,
yee ſhall receive:
David and all the Saints
make ever this foundation
of their Prayer,Pſal. 5. 3. 4. 
                  Vnto
thee will I pray Iehovah,
thou ſhalt heare my voice.
Secondly, as Prayer is
grounded from faith, ſo
it is under-propped by
Hope; I will looke unto the
Lord (ſaith Micha) and I
will waite for the God of
my Salvation;
                  hope and patience. 
                  My God
will heare me; This place
expreſſeth alſo the Chriſtian
patience wherewith
the Prayer of the Saints
is ſeaſoned, and alſo that
perſeverance, whereby

the Charriot of faith is
drawne: Theſe ſet the
ſoule upon the watch-Tower
(as Habacuk ſpeaketh)
and maketh her waite,
                  Habuc. 2. 1
                  and hearken what the Lord
will anſwer, David's Praier
in his diſtreſſe was thus
qualified,Pſal. 5. 3. 
                  I will looke out
ſaith the Prophet.
               
               Further,Preparation, Opportunity, and Diligence. Prayer made
in the Spirit is attended,
with Preparation, Opportunity,
and Diligence: Preparation
maketh ready
the Charriot of faith, awaketh
Prayer, &amp; attireth
it with a holy diſpoſition
of heavenly poſition: Opportunity
as a guide taketh
it the nigheſt way;
and Diligence as the driver
of the Charriot, driveth

more nimbly then
Iehu the ſonne of Nimſhi.
All theſe attend David's
Prayer, I will direct my
Prayer unto thee, or I will
orderly addreſſe unto
thee; there is his Preparation:
In or at the morning
(that is early) there is his
opportunity; I will looke
out or elſe eſpy, there is
his diligence, or I will
pray, that is, ſtill doe pray
and ceaſe not.
               Try then,Hypocrites faile of theſe graces. or let thy
Prayer be tried by theſe
clouds of witneſſes, whether
it be of the ſpirit or
no, for the Prayer of the
Hypocrite hath none of
theſe witneſſes, or attendants:
as it is ſaid of faithleſſe
hearers,Heb. 4. 2. that the Word

heard, did not profit them,
becauſe it was not mixed
with faith: They may
make a faire ſhew in ſeeming
to lay hold on God,
deceiving others &amp; their
own hearts;Mich. 3. 11 
                  they will leane
upon the Lord (ſaith the
Prophet) and ſay, is not the
Lord among us, &amp;c. But
they build upon the ſand
and hence are their ruines;
neither is their hope any
better then Hypocrites
hope,Iob. 3. 13. which ſhall periſh:
as for their patience wherwith
their Prayer ſhould
be ſeaſoned. If God attend
not their pleaſure in
anſwering of their deſires,
it is quickly turned
into murmuring: In this
they are like that graceleſſe

ſervant of that godleſſe
King;2 King. 6. 33. 
                  becauſe this evill
is of the Lord, why
ſhould I waite for the Lord
any longer? As for the attendants
of Prayer, namely
Preparation, Opportunity,
and Diligence, the
Hypocrite is not acquainted
with them; the counterfeit
ſhews or ſhadowes
of theſe he may have, but
the things themſelves in
the true nature of them,
he neither hath nor deſireth
to have: The Hypocrite
ruſheth into Gods
preſence without premeditation
of Gods moſt
glorious preſence, and
without conſideration of
his own vileneſſe, and unworthineſſe
to ſpeake to

ſo glorious and great a
God: His beſt Preparation
is but a vizard of Prepation,
or outward ſhew of
ſeeming holineſſe, in the
poſition of the body:
Their beſt opportunity is
baſe and by reſpect, and
their diligence carrieth
the duty no further then
cuſtomary performance,
or ſo farre as it is in requeſt
with the times. So
never an Hypocrite (you
ſee) can be an Embaſſadour
to God; for he wanteth
both the Commiſſion
of the Spirit, and that
traine of attendants that
doe accompany the Commiſſion.
It is no-wonder
then that their Prayer be
converted into ſinne; for

they are Traytors to God
in taking upon them his
Embaſſie without his Cō
                  miſſion.
               Let them pray then
that can pray;Tryall of theſe graces is neceſſary. yea, it ſtandeth
us all upon, to looke
to it, whether we pray or
prate or bable: For Lord,
Lord, a multitude of faire
words, and faire ſhewes
will not ſerve. An Embaſſadour
with a gilded
coach of temporary faith,
will not ſerve the turne;
yea, though it were full
of miracles attended with
a many imbrodered Lackeyes
of ſmooth words
&amp; courtly complements,
and eare-pleaſing muſick,
ſhall never have admittance
to God, nor audience

of God: look to it
then that thou be an Embaſſadour
indeed, &amp; that
thou haſt thy Commiſſion
ſealed, and art ſent by
the Spirit, and that thy
traine be ſuch as may be
heartily welcome to God
and make thee welcome.
In the firſt place make triall
of thy faith, and that
by the inward acts of purifying
the heart,Tryall of thy faith. uniting
it to God by victory over
temptations, caſting thy
ſelfe upon the Lord, by
contentment of thine eſtate:
alſo by the extenſive
worke of love, firſt to
God for himſelfe, &amp; then
to thy neighbour in him
and for him. The heart
ſo purified by faith is a

fit lymbeck for Prayer.
Out of this the Prophet
David was bold to preſſe
his Prayer upon God;
Hearken to my Prayer
                  Pſal. 17. 2.
                  that goeth not out of feigned
lips, or without lips
of deceipt; by which is
meant the ſyncerity of the
heart, agreeing with the
words of the mouth: Nothing
ſo much adorneth
the heart as faith, nothing
commendeth faith more
then Prayer,Eſay. 29. 13. and nothing
graceth Prayer more then
ſyncerity: This (with the
proud Phariſee) all Hypocrites
want,Mat. 15. 8. 
                  drawing nigh
God with their mouth, and
honouring him with their
lips, but their hearts be far
from him: or as the Pſalmiſt,

                  they flatter or flatteringly
allured him with
their mouth,Pſal. 36. 37. 
                  &amp; with their
tongue lied to him, for their
heart was not right with
him, or not firmly prepared
with him: And this eſpecially
maketh the Praier
of the Hypocrites of an
evill ſavour in Gods Noſtrills,
for as he is the hearer
of the heart (as one
ſaith) and not of the voice,
ſo he loveth the ſyncerity
of the heart, and hateth
the hollowneſſe and rottenneſſe
thereof in Prayer
above all things, becauſe
they goe about to deceive
him, denying him in effect
to be the diſcerner of
the heart; otherwiſe they
would never deal ſo with
him.
               
                  
Try alſo thy hope in
Prayer,Triall of hope and patience. namely by clearing
of thy Author, and
caſting it within the vaile.
The nature of hope is to
keepe thee from ſhame,
by the repulſe of thy deſires,
becauſe the love of
God is ſhed abroad in our
hearts by the holy Ghoſt, in
ſuch abundant meaſure
and unſpeakable manner,
that he cannot deny us the
things hoped for. Try alſo
thy Prayer by patience,
waiting on the Lord, and
going on in Prayer in the
time of diſtreſſe. This an
Hypocrite, as I have ſhewed,
cannot, nor will not
doe. In the time of affliction
they wil ſet very freſhly
upon the duty; ſo farre

as great words will carry
it, but if they be brought
to any ſtrait, or put to
any hard ſhift, like whitelivered
ſouldiers they die
down-right in their owne
ayre or element, or elſe
fling away their arms, and
run from their Colours.
It is much to be feared
that our nations woefull
experience ſhall teach the
truth of this in one as wel
as the other! But God giveth
his owne another
heart, namely to overtop
the height of their affections,
with the height of
their Prayers, and never
give over till by patience
and importunity they poſſeſſe
the gates of their enemies
and become more

then Conquerors: The
Scripture to this purpoſe
affordeth abundance of
remarkable inſtances, for
a touch whereof take
theſe two; Steven the firſt
Martyr being caſt out of
the City and ſtoned for
his worthy Sermon, as
the ſtones were flying about
his eares, in the midſt
of all the miſchiefe that
they could doe him, by
the power of the holy
Ghoſt,Act. 7. 55. 59. 60. 
                  called upon God,
and that with cryes kneeling
upon his knees: This
leſſon no doubt hee learof
his Maſter Chriſt, the
beſt and only pattern that
any man can follow: He,
though a Sonne, learned
obedience by afflictions,

in the dayes of his fleſh,
offered up Prayers and
Supplications withſtrong
crying and tears unto him
that was able to ſave him
from death, &amp; was heard
in that he feared: where
obſerve what force, feare,
and afflictions added to
our Saviours Prayers,
which as ſwelling ſeas
make well growne fiſh,
and thundring, and lightning
cleereth the ayre, and
the nipping froſt maketh
the fire the hotter; So the
afflictions of the Saints
addeth force to their Praiers;
they cry more mightily
to God then ever they
did, yea, where they could
not ſpeake before, now
they cry and that day

and night (ſaith the Spirit)
though he beare long
with them:Luk. 18. 7. where obſerve
the patience of the Saints,
they beare long in Gods
bearing with their enemies:
Then obſerve their
inſtant continuance, they
cry day and night; to the
ſame effect the Lord ſpeaketh
by his Prophet,Zacch. 13. 9. 
                  I
will bring the third part
through the fire, and will
refine them as gold is tryed,
they ſhall call upon my
name, and I will hear them:
Affliction maketh the
wicked impatient, &amp; driveth
them from God; becauſe
they are a burniſhed
blade of terror in the hand
of the Almighty: as the
pearle in oyſters by thunder

vaniſheth, ſo doth the
Prayer of the Hypocrite
by affliction; but the triall
of the godly bringeth
forth patience, &amp; driveth
them nigher to God, becauſe
their afflictions are
but trialls indeed, and at
the worſt they are but as
a rod in the hand of a loving
Father. In a word, as
the Saints extremities are
Gods opportunities; ſo
the ſame extremities are
whetſtones to the Saints
importunities.
               Laſtly, as for preparation;
labour to ſet thy
heart in frame, conſider
what thou art about, and
with whom thou haſt to
deale: As God bid Moſes,
                  Exod. 3. 5.
                  put off thy ſhooes from

thy feet, for the place where
thou ſtādeſt is holy ground;
whereby is meant the
putting off of earthly and
carnal affections, preparing
the mind to ſpiritual
and heavenly duties. Endeavour
to come before
the Lord with a ſimple
and naked heart, and with
affections duly prepared
for ſo great a preſence. As
for Opportunity, endeavour
alwaies to be fit upon
every occaſion, and
fea
                     ••
                   to chooſe the beſt
occaſion, not omitting it
at any hand: for Diligence
know this, that uſe maketh
an Artiſt or Tradeſman.
To conclude this
particular: If thou callest
upon the Lord in truth,
                  
that is in faith, ſyncerity,
earneſtneſſe and conſtancy,
the Lord will be nigh
unto thee; which is both
the cauſe and evidence
that thou prayeſt by the
Spirit.
               The ſeventh evidence
of Prayer made by the
Spirit,7 The guidance of the Spirit in all our actions. is the guidance of
the Spirit in all other actions:
For as he that is born
of the Spirit, is Spirit, ſo
he is ſpirituall in all his
parts, faculties and actions;
becauſe the Spirit is
of an all renuing nature,
though many remainders
of the fleſh, and much reluctation
be intermixed
therewith throughout all
the parts, faculties and actions.
To this effect is

that of the Apoſtle, As
many as are led by the Spirit,
they be the ſonnes of
God; where obſerve, hee
ſaith not, they that have
received the Spirit, or live
by the Spirit, or pray
by the Spirit, or doe any
other action, as he ſaith
other where, but that they
are led by the Spirit, intimating
thereby the inclining
diſpoſition and everruling
power of the Spirit,
whereby the whole
ſpirituall man is guided
in all his waies, as a ſhip
by a pilot, or a horſe by
his rider; the place alludeth
to a blind man, or a
man wanting ſtrength,
who is wholly guided or
carried by another; ſo

Gods ſupplicants as they
pray by the ſpirit, ſo they
wholly reſign themſelves
over in all their waies to
the guidance of the ſpirit:Wherein the guidance of the Spirit manifeſteth it ſelfe.
The guidance of the ſpirit
in all a petitioners
waies, doth manifeſt it
ſelfe in theſe two particulars;
               Firſt,In the ſubduing the whole body of ſinne. in the ſubdueing
of the whole body of ſin;
for though the remnans
of ſin remain in the beſt
of Gods Saints, yet no ſin
beareth dominion in thē;
for then ſhould they not
be led by the ſpirit: who
are led by the ſpirit (ſaith
one) but they whoſe counſells
and actions have
nothing to doe with ſin &amp;
Sathan; according to that

of the Apoſtle,1. Ioh. 3. 9. 
                  Hee that is
borne of God ſinneth not,
or commiteth not ſin, viz.
he ſerveth not ſin, hee delighteth
not in ſin, he maketh
not a trade of it, nor
lyeth not in it, giveth not
way to it, but reſiſteth it
and hateth it; it is an intolerable
burthen to him,
he cannot beare it. But on
the contrary,V. 8. 
                  he that committeth
ſin is of the Divel,
that is, he that loveth ſin,
loveth and obeyeth it in
the luſts thereof. Now
where this ſin-ſubduing
power of the ſpirit beareth
ſway, there the prayers
bee the prayers of the
ſpirit: For as divers gifts
come from one ſpirit, ſo
where there is one true

gift of the ſpirit, there bee
all the gifts of the ſpirit;
but on the cōtrary, where
one ſinne beareth ſway,
there is not the guidance
of the ſpirit, and where
the ſpirit is not the guide,
there the prayer is not the
prayer of the ſpirit, according
to that undeniable
poſition, God heareth
not ſinners, but if any man
be a worſhipper of God,
                  Ioh. 9. 21. 
                  and
doth his will, him he heareth.
viz. he heareth not,
nor granteth the deſires
of ſuch as live in any ſin;
but ſuch as worſhip him
according to his will, and
live accordingly, have
their deſires granted; But
a party, family, or nation,
that liveth in any ſin, God

will not hear them. If I regard
iniquity in my heart
(ſaith David) or look upon
it with a love to it,
                  Pſal. 66. 18. 
                  God will
not heare me. Inſtances of
this are innumerable in
the Scripture; The Lord
telleth the Iſraelites for
chooſing Saul for their
King,1 Sam. 8. 8. that they ſhould cry
out in that day, and hee
would not heare them: So
all that ſet at naught the
counſell of God, when
feare, deſolation, and deſtruction
commeth upon
them,Prov. 25. 26. 27. 
                  They ſhall call upon
the Lord but hee will not
anſwer; they ſhall ſeek him
early but ſhall not find him:
Will men steale and rob,
                  Ier. 11. 11.
                  commit murther and uncleanneſſe,
and conſpire againſt

God by impiety and
iniquity (as God ſaith by
Ieremie) yea will they hide
it under their tongue, and
will they cry unto the Lord
when unavoidable evill
commeth upon them? yea
they ſhall cry (ſaith the
Lord) but I will not hearken
unto them: For the farther
confirmation of this
point, look theſe places.
Ezech. 8. to the 19. Micha
3. to v. 4. Zach. 7. 13. Did
God ever heare the Iſraelites,
for all their teares,
ſupplications and cryes
under the oppreſſion of
the Philiſtines,
                  Iudg. 10. 6. to 18. untill ſuch
time as they put away
their ſtrange Gods,1 Sam. 7. 2. to 12. yea
their beloved Idols,Iſay 1. 15. to 19. 
                  Baal
and Aſhteroth? No ſure;

witneſſe the word; neither
will he to others till they
doe the like: yea God
doth not onely deny to
heare his people, though
they make many prayers,
but to enter ſo much as a
parly with them, till they
put away the evill of their
doings from before him.
Yea let the formaliſt hypocrite,
or hollow-hearted
petitioner, free from
outward touch, yet hiding
iniquity under his
tongue, let him (I ſay) carry
the matter as cleanly as
he can, yet God will not
heare him, witneſſe that in
Iob; What is the hope of
the Hypocrite, will God
heare his cry when trouble
commeth upon him? No

ſure; the interrogation is
a vehement negation; a
good reaſon is given of it:
As hee delighted not in
God, make what ſhew he
can, ſo God delighteth
not in his prayers, for
they are not the prayers
of the ſpirit, neither hath
he clenſed his heart for
the ſpirit to reſide in. That
thou maiſt bee ſure that
thy prayer is from the ſpirit,
bee ſure to walk in the
Spirit: ſubmit thy ſelfe to
the guidance of the ſpirit;
waſh thy heart and make it
clean,
                  Eſay. 1. 16. Pſ. 26. 6. 
                  waſh thy hands in
innocency, and then compaſſe
the Altar of the Lord
with ſucceſſe; or, as the Apoſtle,
pray every where,
                  Tim. 2. 8.
                  lifting up holy hands without

wrath or doubting: On
this place one ſpeaketh
well; the hands are holy,
when the heart is cleane:
further, in the Text obſerve
three remarkable
conditions of prayer, holineſſe
in a mans ſelf; love
towards his brother; and
faith towards God: prayers
thus qualified ſhall
ſurely be heard, for Amen
hath ingaged his promiſe
for it: Iehovah is neer to all
that call upō him in truth:
the Lord is far from the
wicked; but hee heareth
the prayers of the righteous.
               But ſome of Gods
people will here object,Ob. 1.
that they feel a great deale
of rebellion of ſin in them,

as carnality, hate, infidelity,
proneſſe to evill, averſneſſe
to good; pride,
hypocriſie, ſelfe-love, and
the like; a world of diſorder
in the affections, a flat
repugnancy in the will, an
apparant impoſſibility of
ſelfe-deniall: In a word,
the whole inner and the
outward man, is nothing
but a confuſed maſſe of
ſin: Can the ſpirit govern
&amp; guide ſuch a one where
there is nothing but rebellion
againſt the Spirit?
And if the Spirit beare
not the ſway in all &amp; over
all, though I am ſomewhat
affected in prayer,
yet I pray not by the ſpirit
at all, becauſe I want
the guidance of the ſpirit.
               
                  
To this I anſwer;Anſwer As
the aforeſaid graces accompanying
the ſpirit of
prayer, may be in a childe
of God in a very weake
meaſure, without ſenſe &amp;
feeling, yet true in their
own nature; ſo the luſting
of the fleſh againſt the ſpirit,
may and doth mightily
domineer in them; ſo
that they are carnall and
ſold under ſin,Rom. 7. 14. yea they
have a law in their members
rebelling againſt the
law of the Spirit, whereby
they are led captive to the
law of ſinne; which thing
was the matter of the bleſſed
Apoſtle's complaint,
making him to cry out,
Wretched man that I am,
who ſhall deliver mee from

this body of death! And
yet the ſpirit luſting againſt
the fleſh will hold
his own, not onely overcōming,
but giving good
evidence from the very
ſtrife, that he reignes and
rules there, maugre the
heart of the fleſh: by
which they come at the
length to thanke God
through our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt,Rom 7. 25. 
                  that with the mind
they ſerve the Law of God,
though with the fleſh the
Law of ſin.
               
               But Paul,
                  2. Ob. yee will ſay,
ſpake this of himſelfe, as
of his unregenerate eſtate.
               For anſwer; The Papiſts
would have it ſo,Anſwer and
ſome of the Fathers take

it ſo, amongſt whom Auſtin
was one of that mind,
but upon better conſideration
reverſed his judgment,
and that upon good
grounds; for the Apoſtle
ſpeaketh of himſelfe of
his preſent eſtate, which
none can deny to be regenerate.
Againe, to will was
preſent with him; hee delighted
in the Law of
God and thanked him for
his deliverance: all which
are evidences of a regenerate
eſtate. But this is
ſtrange, ſay you, that hee
ſhould be carnall, &amp; ſould
under ſin, ſince the Saints
are bought with a price; &amp;
war not after the fleſh. For
anſwer, he was not carnall
in the ſervice of the fleſh,

as the unregenerate are,
but hee was carnall in reſpect
of his proneſſe,1 Cor. 6. 20. to
give way to the fleſh;2 Cor. 10. 3. So
he was ſold under ſin, and
not as Ahab, who willingly
inſlaved himſelfe to
ſin; but as Ioſeph a captive
or ſlave againſt his will.
               O but you will ſay,Ob. 2. if it
were ſo, then theſe were
Pauls ſtrong ſtragling
motions of cōcupiſcence,
not breaking out in effect,
but I am not onely troubled
with the firſt and ſecond
motions of ſin, but I
am foyled with the very
actions of ſin:
               I anſwer,Anſ. was not that
Pauls caſe: That which I
doe I allow not;
                  Rom. 7. 15 
                  for what
I would, that I doe not; but

what I hate that doe I:
where hee ſheweth himſelfe
often to be ſo foiled
by his carnall deſires, that
he did that which in the
inner man he did not deſire,
but rather hate; And
ſo it is with the beſt of
Gods people, who both
in words &amp; actions croſſe
their inward deſires,
               Yea,Queſt. but where lyeth
the difference of failings
and falls of the regenerate
and unregenerate heart.
               I anſwer, in the chiefe
deſire of the heart;Anſwer which
in the unregenerate longeth
and lamenteth after
good, though it have many
ſhrewd rubs in the way
through the remainders
of ſin; but in the unregenerate

it is carried with
full ſway toward ſinne
without any reſiſtance,
though it may ſtumble
now and then upon the
ſting of conſcience: neither
would I haue any, by
preſuming to abuſe this
cauſe of Paul, to ſinne, for
none can benefit by this,
but ſuch as have Pauls
feelings, deſires, and endeavours
in ſome meaſure:
but let al ſuch as are
fervent in ſpirit ſerving
the Lord, though with
much oppoſition &amp; litle
or no feeling of the evidence
of the ſpirit, lay
home this caſe to their
comfort.
               The latter particular
wherein the guidance of

the ſpirit conſiſteth, is the
quickning and increaſing
of grace:Quickning and increaſe of grace. for as by the ſpirit,
the deeds of the body are
mortified, ſo by the ſame
ſpirit the graces of the ſoul
are quickned,
                  Rom. 8. 13. &amp; therefore
is the ſpirit called the ſpirit
of grace:
                  Zac. 10. 12 Now the ſpirit
of grace is joyned with
the ſpirit of ſupplication,
as the Cauſe and the convertible
Effect, the ſtate &amp;
the demonſtrative evidence
of the ſtate: I will
poure out (ſaith the Lord
by Zachary in the place
quoted) the ſpirit of grace
and ſupplication or deprecation:
Where by the ſpirit
of grace is meant the
gracious ſpirit of regeneration,
proceeding from

the grace of God, guiding
and quickning his own in
all the waies of grace: &amp;
by the ſpirit of deprecation,
that ſpirituall immediatly
infuſed ability (as I
have ſhewed,) whereby
his penitents doe beg and
obtain pardon of ſin and
all other things conducing
to Gods glory, and
their own good. Between
this ſpirit of grace, and deprecation
there is a mutuall
ſtrengthning or corroboration:
As health is
the cauſe of walking, and
by walking is ſtrength aſſured
and increaſed; ſo
grace is the internall, immediate,
conjunct cauſe of
prayer, and is alſo quickned
and ſtrengthned by

prayer: Or as the heat of
the ſun reflecting upon
ſome ſolid or impenetrable
body, is made more
forcible; So the radiant
beames of grace, exerciſing
themſelves upon that
firmly framed object of
prayer by a gracious reflection,
they become out
of meaſure gracious. If
thou wouldſt then excell
in grace, labour to excell
in that eminent ability of
prayer, which doth not
conſiſt (as I have ſhewed)
in the excellēcy of words
but in the heigtht &amp; depth
of the grones of the ſpirit,
which no words are able
to expreſſe. Try alſo by
the gage or land-mark of
prayer, the ebbing or floing

of the tide of grace:
for ſo much as thy ſoule
is taken up with the true
ſtrain of prayer, ſo much
doſt thou gain in the rich
traffique of grace; and ſo
much as thou looſeſt in the
faculty of this heavenly
Oratory, ſo much thou
looſeſt in the ſtocke of
grace. Therefore for the
keeping of both ſtock and
intereſt on foot, it ſhall be
good, in my judgement,
to put theſe two particular
obſervations in practice:
Firſt look what particular
ſin either of perſon
or calling thou art moſt
addicted unto; &amp; in what
patticular grace thou art
moſt deficient;Meanes of keeping &amp; increaſing of grace. labour to
countermand, and ſubdue

the particular ſin by the
oppoſite grace, and to
quicken &amp; ſtrengthen the
weak and decaied grace
by the ſpeciall or proper
remedies. This is the wiſeſt
policy, the higheſt
point of war, the richeſt
trade, and the proper imployment
of our precious
talent.
               Another remarkable
obſervation to be practiſed
is this; Let no day
paſſe thee wherein thou
doſt not call thy ſelfe to a
ſtrict accompt, of the well
imployment, ill imployment,
or miſimployment
of the day; record as neer
as thou canſt thy commiſſions
and omiſſions, in
thy calling or out of thy

calling, in thought, word,
or deed, againſt piety, equity,
or ſobriety; recall
thy company and conference,
thine or others profiting
thereby or unprofitableneſſe;
recompt the
favours, the frownings,
the cheriſhments or chaſtiſements,
mercies or
judgements towards thee
and others as nigh as
thou canſt; obſerve what
corruption hath prevailed
againſt thee, or in what
particular grace thou getteſt
any better footing.
This courſe deſerveth
neither obloquie from
the wicked, nor ſhould it
ſeem unneceſſary, ſtrict,
or impoſſible to profeſſours:
For the very Heathens

by the guide nature
have given order for it in
their morals, namely, that
wee ſhould not ſuffer our
eyes to ſleep, nor our eyelids
to ſlumber, till wee
had recompted all the
paſſages of the former
day. But alas they had but
a leaden rule to walke by,
turning all their ſtricteſt
&amp; moſt glorious actions
into gliſtring ſinnes! but
we have a golden rule of
trial, which by a true touch
will (indeed) turn us and
our actions into the pureſt
gold. It is a double ſhame
therefore that they in this
ſhould ſhame us: this ſame
point was a particular of
Moſes his Petition; So
teach us to number our

daies that we may apply our
hearts to wiſdome!
                  Pſ. 90. 12. There
is no better waies to
thriue than for a man to
be a good accomptant, &amp;
to obſerve well his loſſes
and his gaines, his receits
and his layings out; what
is owing to him, &amp; what
he oweth to others. This
gaines a wiſe heart or a
heart of wiſdome (ſaith
Moſes) which is more
worth then all the wealth
in the world. This is the
only meanes whereby to
redeem the time: in which
phraſe the Apoſtle implieth
the calling a mans ſelf
to accompt, and his actions,
as thrifty Merchants
doe; the Apoſtles words
looke both backe to the

time paſt, adviſing us to
make good one time
what wee loſe at another,
which cannot be done
without reckoning, with
our ſelves; and alſo forward
to the time to come,
injoyning us to take all
occaſion and opportunity
of ſerving the Lord, with
more ſtrictneſſe, ſincerity
and alacrity, then heretofore
we have done, ſuppoſe
it be with temporall
loſſe or incommodityt: he
very word Redeeme includeth
this evidently, that
for our profits, eaſe and
pleaſing of others, we put
off, or altogether neglect
the caſting up of our accompts;
now if wee will
redeeme that loſſe, wee

muſt be content to part
with all theſe to become
good accomptants; not
that men hereby ſhould
neglect their callings; for
this wil make them more
ſtrict, ſincere, and diligent
in their callings; but as to
this ſtrict courſe and the
attending it many incommodities
are incident;
(For you muſt know the
Divell, World, Fleſh, and
it may be ſome of the
houſhold are no friends to
it:) So we muſt accompt
all are for Cyphers for the
furthering our accompts.
Theſe ſtrict accomptants
muſt make this a part of
their reckoning, that the
Croſſe will follow them;
for the bearing whereof

they muſt reſolve upon
ſelfe-denyall, with the hatred
of father and mother,
wife and children, and life
it ſelfe,
                  Col. 1. 21. which ſhall be no
diſadvantage to them, for
Chriſts ſake; and life and
death is to ſuch advantage.
Of the neceſſity
of our ſummoning up ofThe neceſſity hereof
ourſelves, and our wayes,
the Apoſtle gives good
reaſons;Epheſ. 5. 15. 16. Firſt, wee muſt
walke ſtrictly, not declining
a haires breadth from
the marke: Secondly the
way is hard and difficult,
that is alſo implied in the
words: Thirdly, the dayes
are evill, nay ſure never
worſe: Many ſtumbling
blockings &amp; rubbes, much
oppoſition both on the

right hand and on the left,
within and without, when
Trading groweth hard,
Wares grow ſlight, Pirats
abound, Merchants cheat
their Chap-men, &amp; Chapmen
fill the earth with
bankrupts, and the Priſons
with black ſmoke and
beaſtlineſſe, is it not very
hard for a faire trader to
walk with a ſtreight foot,
to give every man his
owne, and to make good
his ſtock, and maintaine
his family? yes ſure, every
man averreth it: How
much harder is it in theſe
wofull times, to make
good this ſpirituall traffick;
wherein the Parents
will defraud the children,
the children cheat the parents,

the husband the
wife, &amp; the wife the husband,
the brother the brother;
yea, a man will cheat
and cozen his own ſoule?
It ſtandeth every one
therefore upon it, to look
to his own accompts; becauſe
every one muſt give
an account for himſelfe.
This taske I muſt confeſſe
is ſomewhat hard to ſet
upon,The difficulty hereof. the rather becauſe
it will not ſtand with neglect
or intermiſſion; but aſſuredly
the conſtant uſe
of it ſhall make a man ſee
better and more comfortable
dayes then ever
heretofore he hath ſeene:
By this courſe he ſhall be
brought to ſee himſelfe
often as in a glaſſe, and by

the ſight of his failings,
he ſhall be brought to
ſoftneſſe of heart, to tenderneſſe
of conſcience, to
deprecate the evil of commiſſion
and omiſſion, and
to ſupplicate for power
againſt future aſſaults:
This ſhall make him
watchfull over his waies,
wary of his company,
ſtrict in his carriage, zealous
for his God, and holy
and profitable in all
manner of converſation.
In a word, the experimentall
utility of this practice
will ſhew ſuch neceſſity
of it, that thou wilt not
believe it till thou try it:
Try then, and hold faſt
the practice, &amp; it ſhal never
repent thee.
               
                  
To this daily accompt
joyn thy weekly accompt
and thy accompt of more
weekes,Weekly and more generall accompts. before thou goe
to the ſacrament, and by
uſe of time thou maiſt become
an excellent accomptant:
The more thou attendeſt
it, the leſſe thou
ſhalt have to doe; yea, by
the practiſing by it, thou
ſhalt be the more willing
to attend it; though thou
canſt not be like that Emperour,
that attended ſuits
till he had no ſuiters (for
thou ſhalt alwaies find enough
to doe,) yet thou
ſhalt find thy ſelfe by
Gods mercy much inabled
to goe cheerfully
through with the worke,
and if thou art faithfull in

thine accompts, thou
ſhalt every time find thy
ſelfe a gainer.
               The eighth particular
of the Spirit's evidence in
Prayer,8 The precious promiſes. is from that infallible
ground of the faith
of the Saints viz. The precious
promiſes of God. The
ſame Spirit called the Spirit
of ſupplication, is alſo
called the Spirit of promiſe,
which doth not only
ſignifie to us the reſidence
of the Spirit in the
Saints, whereby they are
diſtinguiſhed and diſcerned
from the wicked, but
alſo, after an Hebraiſme
or Hebrew Phraſe, the aſſuring
of them of thoſe
great and precious promiſes,
or things promiſed

is underſtood: on which
the Prayers of the Saints
make their ſtand and riſe.
Theſe were the ſupporters
of David's faith;Pſal. 119. 49. 
                  Remember
thy word to thy
ſervant, upon which thou
haſt cauſed mee to hope;
wherein is well obſerved
by the Ancient,Ambroſe. that David
in all his ſupplications
had recourſe to the
promiſes of God.2 Sam. 7. 25. 28. 
                  And
now Lord God (ſaith the
ſame Prophet) the word
that thou haſt ſpoken concerning
thy ſervant, eſtabliſh
it. And againe, thou
art God and thy words are
true: whereupon ſhall the
weake ſights of a weary
and overladen ſoule, and
the heavy groans of a loaded

conſcience caſt themſelves,
but upon that ſweet
and comfortable promiſe
of our Saviour,Mat. 11. 28. 
                  Come unto
me all yee that labour and
are heavy laden and I will
refreſh you! How ſhall the
poore diſtreſſed ſelfe condemning
bankrupt preſſe
home his earneſt ſuit upon
God with any confidence
of diſcharge, but by
putting God to his promiſe
of the new Covenant;
I am he,
                  Iſay 43. 25. 
                  I am he (ſaith
the Lord) that blotteth out
thine iniquities, for my
names ſake, and will not remember
thy ſinnes. The
ſoule in Prayer may put
God to remembrance of
his promiſe, not to remember
ſinne. Alſo how

ſhould the ſoule tyrannized
over by the body of
ſome corruptiō ever look
by Prayer to prevaile againſt
the power of it, but
upon the promiſe of God,
to put the power of the
word into the heart;
whereby the heart is changed
from a ſtony and rebellious
diſpſition,Ier. 38. into a
ſoft,
                  Ezech. 36. 
                  pliable and obedient
diſpoſition. How ſhal the
fainting ſoule ſupport her
ſupplication in the day
of diſtreſſe; or how ſhould
ſhe wreſtle with God in
the time of calamity,
when God by contending
deſireth not only to
be gone, but in ſence is already
departed, except
they have at hand that

promiſe,Pſal. 50. 15. 
                  Call upon me in
the day of trouble, and I
will deliver thee? Laſtly,
how ſhall ever the ſoule
attaine by Prayer to reſt
it ſelfe upon the hope of
glory, but by intereſſing
it ſelfe into the promiſe of
the Crowne of Glory,
laid up for him, and all
them that love the appearing
of the Lord Ieſus
Chriſt? So that theſe promiſes
are like Aaron and
Hur holding up the hands
&amp; ſtrengthning the heart
of Prayer; yea, as the remembrance
and application
of theſe, faileth or increaſeth,
ſo the Spirit of
Prayer faileth or increaſeth.Prayers of the regenerate and unregenerate differ.
               
               And here lyeth a main

difference, of the Prayers
of the regenerate and unregenerate:
The Prayers
of the former are upholden
and ſupported from
an externall principle,
namely the promiſes of
God that cannot faile but
the Prayers of the later
lean upon the broken reed
of ſomething within thē
                  ſelves,
namely, ſome
workes of charity, equity
or out-ſide pietie, the
worth of their Prayer it
ſelfe, or the mud-wall of
civill honeſty; all which
are but as a rotten wall,
whereupon the beſt Praiers
that they build are but
ſtraw and ſtubble, and
both foundation and building
being naught, they

muſt be burnt with fire.
               If any object that Nehemiah
                  
                     Ob. 1. Nehem. 13. 14.
deſireth the Lord
againe and againe to remember
his workes of
Piety and Iuſtice, and that
he would not wipe out the
good deeds he had done, for
the houſe of his God, and
for the offices thereof: So
King Ezekias in his Praier1 King. 20. 3.
deſireth the Lord to
remember his walking before
the Lord, his integrity
of heart, and doing good
before the Lord.
               
               I anſwer,Anſ. that neither
the zealous Ruler, nor the
godly King did preſume
any whit upon the worth
of their works, as though
thereby they ſhould make
their Prayers of acceptance

with God; but if the
places be well obſerved,
they caſt themſelves
wholly upon the mercies
of God, and not upon the
merit of their Prayers,
deſiring God out of his
promiſe made, to reſpect
the integrity of the heart,
and the righteouſneſſe of
the actions, to make good
his promiſe; like unto that
in Iob; He ſhall call upon
God, and he will be favourable
to him; and hee ſhall
ſee his face with joy: For
he will render unto man
his righteouſneſse. Falſe
and forged then is that
gloſſe of the Doctors of
Doway, upon that place
of Nehemiah: Ajust man
that hath merited by good

works, may pray with great
confidence of reward.
               
               Further,Ob. 2. if any object;
If Prayer depend upon
promiſes, what need men
pray, ſince God will acknowledge
his promiſes,
without our Prayers, for
all his promiſes are Yea
and Amen?
               
               For anſwer,Anſw. briefly, he
that hath promiſed to
heare, hath commanded
us alſo to pray, and without
praying no promiſe
to heare; yea, the Son of
God himſelfe, who doubted
not of his glorification,
did notwithſtanding
pray, Father glorifie thy
Son.
               
               Try then thy intereſt
to the promiſes, by the

laying hold, or deſiring
to lay hold on the promiſes,
&amp; thereby thou maiſt
know, whether thou praieſt
in the Spirit or no,
keep alwaies thine eye upon
the promiſes; for as
the load ſtone keepeth alwaies
the point of the
needle towards the northpole,
ſo the load-ſtone of
Gods promiſes keepeth
alwaies the point of the
Prayer touched therewith,
directly towards the
Mercy ſeat of God: But
as the unregenerate man
hath no portion in the
promiſes, ſo the promiſes
are no point of that Compaſſe
whereby his Prayers
are guided. It is true
indeed, that a wicked man

out of the darkneſſe of
his thoughts may charge
God with ſuch a promiſe
as God never made, by
miſconſtruing of the promiſe;
as for inſtance,His argument. (Call
upon me in the day of diſtreſſe,
and I will releaſe
thee: This promiſe a wicked
man may thus urge;
Thou haſt bound thy
ſelfe by promiſe (Lord) to
deliver all thoſe that are
troubled and call upon
thee; but I am in trouble
and call upon thee; therefore
thou haſt bound thy
ſelfe by the promiſe to
deliver mee; and ſo from
thee I ſeeke for deliverance.
               The Argument is a ſophiſmeAnſ.
(as wee ſpeake)

from the homonumie, or
diverſe ſignifications of
the word, all which in the
former propoſition muſt
be taken for calling upon
the Lord in truth; but in
the later in cannot be ſo taken;
for the wicked may
prate and bable, but hee
calleth not upon the Lord,
as I have ſhewed, &amp; therefore
he hath no intereſt in
the promiſe: Hee leaveth
out the maine evidence,
namely, the Glorifying
of God, which a wicked
man never doth; ſo that
he preſumeth himſelfe to
doe that he doth not, and
God to promiſe that
which he never meant.
               Againe, a wicked man
may obtaine that which

he payeth for, as ſucceſſe,
honour, wealth, temporall
deliverance, and the
like; whereupon hee preſumeth
of ſome intereſt to
the premiſes; but it doth
not follow: For as God
heareth not in every thing
or alwaies, the children of
the promiſe, becauſe they
are not fitted, or it is not
good for them, or the
the time is not come; ſo
he often giveth the wicked
things they crave, in
his wrath, they having no
ground to aske or receive
any thing from him, as a
promiſe to them; for they
are none of the children
of the promiſe: They
have neither promiſe of
the things of this life nor

a better; neither doe they
with patience waite the
Will of God, that they
may receive the promiſe;
but the childrens only
care is to make good to
themſelves ſome intereſt
to the promiſes, and that
by cleanſing themſelves
from all filthineſſe of fleſh
and ſpirit, and by doing
the Will of God, waiting
with patience for the promiſes,
endeavouring to
bring them home by faith
and ſupplication without
ceaſing.
               The ninth Evidence of
the Spirit of Prayer,9 the directing of Prayer. is
the directing of Prayer
to God in the name of
Chriſt: we are commanded
thus to doe; for what

is it to ſeek the Face of God
according to his owne appointment,
but to ſeeke
him in the Face of his anointed?
Drawing neare
unto God in Chriſt, hath
only the promiſe of hearing,
witneſſe Chriſt himſelfe,
binding it with an
aſſeveration, Verily,
                  Ioh. 16. 25 
                  verily
I ſay unto you, what ſoever
yee ſhall aske the Father
in my name that will
I doe; By no other, nor in
no other can wee ſpeed,
but in and by him; what
other can appeaſe the
wrath of God againſt us?
Dare man by any other
ſhew his face in Gods
preſence? In the worth of
Chriſt only our Prayers
find acceptance with God

in him as in a golden Cenſor,Rev. 8. 34.
all the Prayers of the
Saints come to be fragrant
and ſweet-ſmelling
odors: He is the only mediatour
as well of Interceſſion
as Redemption:
He is the Prieſt, the golden
Altar by whoſe vertue
our Prayers come to
be a Sacrifice. Did there
ever any prevaile with
God but in his name? Is
there any way or acceſſe
but by his name? Hee is
that high Prieſt going into
the Sanctuary, carrying
on his ſhoulders, and
alſo on his breaſt the
twelve precious ſtones,
repreſenting the twelve
Tribes, or all the faithful.
Hence it is cleare that Papiſts

goe not to God, going
in the name of Saints
and Angels; ſometime in
the name of Traytors and
godleſſe perſons! In the
name (I ſay) of their own
worth and merit: neither
doth any reprobate goe to
God in the name of Chriſt,
for Chriſt is no Interceſſor
for him; I pray not for
the world,
                  Ioh. 17. 19 
                  but for them
which thou haſt granted
me; for they are thine. A
great rabble of the unregenerate,
as Hypocrites,
carnall Goſpellers, meere
civill men, will tell you
they defie Popery; they
hold it foolery and madneſſe
to pray to Saint or
Angell, and alſo robbery
to goe to God by them;

and therefore they ſcorne
it, they acknowledge no
other mediatour of Interceſſion
but Chriſt Ieſus:
All this is wel ſpoken, but
what availeth this them?
They will tell you further,
in Chriſt his name
they dayly make their
Prayers to God: This is
not ſo, for they have no
intereſt to take his name
in their mouths, or to
make mention of it, hating
to be renued. It is true
they may ſpeake of his
name, and ſo egregiouſly
abuſe it, as they that will
alleage it in the great day,
that they propheſyed and
caſt out Divels in his name,
of whom he will profeſse
(that is openly proclaim)

                  he knew them not: viz. he
never acknowledged thē
for his, yea he deteſteth
them and biddeth them
away, as workers of iniquity;
ſo ſhall it bee with
all corrupt pleaders, uſurping
the name of Chriſt.
They onely that know this
name (as the Pſalmiſt
ſaith) can trust in it,
                  Pſal. 9. 11. 
                  and
fly unto it as a ſtrong tower.
They know the Lords
name &amp; the Lord knoweth
theirs;I ſay. 52. 6. 
                  My people (ſaith
the Prophet) ſhall know
my name, &amp;c. And becauſe
hee hath ſet his love upon
me, or cleaveth to mee (as
the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh,)
therefore I will deliver
him:
                  Pſal. 91. 14 15. 
                  I will ſet him on high
becauſe hee knoweth my

name: He ſhall call upon me
and I will anſwer him.
               
               Look then to it in all
thy ſupplications to look
towards God in Chriſt:The neceſſity and benefit hereof
As Moſes, deſiring to ſee
the face of God, was put by
God in the Clift of the
rock, and covered with
his hand till he paſſed by,
that he might ſee his back
parts; ſo thou and thy
prayers muſt be put in the
Rock Chriſt Ieſus, if ever
thou com'ſt to ſee the face
of God in favour. As they
that would make an echo
repaire to ſome rocky
place whereupon the
words reſound, ſo they
that will have an anſwer
from God, muſt either ply
their prayers upon the

Rock Chriſt Ieſus, or no
ccho, no anſwer at all: As
they that are dim-ſighted
make the object more apparant
by the uſe of ſpectacles;
or as ſome ſpeak
through a trunck that
they may bee the better
heard; So the Saints look
through Chriſt, &amp; ſpeake
through Chriſt; that they
may ſee God and heare
God giving a gracious
anſwer. As ſome glaſſe
maketh things preſented
by it, to be the ſame colour;
So God looking upon
us in Chriſt, ſeeth us
to be of the colour of his
Son, and wee looking on
God through Chriſt, ſee
God reconciled to us in
Chriſt: Therefore whatſoever

wee offer to God,
let us preſent it to him
through Chriſt; ſet alwaies
Chriſt betweene
thee and him; and whatſoever
God giveth to thee,
labour to entertain it alwaies
&amp; through Chriſt:
herein comfort ſhall abound
to thee &amp; honour
to God. As by ſome kind
of Perſpectives a man
may bring two objects
together; So by the Perſpective
of faith, directing
the prayer to God, in and
by Chriſt, thou maiſt
bring God and Chriſt &amp;
all the promiſes home to
thy ſoule at one ſight.
               The tenth evidence
that a man prayeth by the Spirit,10. Praying in a time of trouble.
is the betaking of

himſelfe to it in the time
of trouble, as to a rock of
defence, or the making of
it his eſpeciall remedy in
the time of miſery. For
this indeed is the very
beſt: as David ſaid of Goliah's,
there is none like
this; ſo there is no ſword
like unto the ſword of the
Spirit. This is a true Panacea
to heal all maladies,
a balm for the wounded
conſcience, a precious
medicine for all diſeaſes
of the body, a plaiſter for
all ſores, a cordiall againſt
all diſcomforts, armes invaſive
&amp; defenſive againſt
all enimies: The Apoſtle
delivereth all this in few
words; If any bee afflicted
let him pray. It is the ſafeſt

guard againſt all evills of
ſin,Prayer an al ſufficient remedy. and evills of puniſhment,1. Reaſon.
it is the onely beſt
meanes of deliverance
from both theſe: witneſſe
firſt that great Phyſitian
God himſelfe (for ſo hee
calleth himſelfe)Exod. 15. 26. 
                  I am Iehovah
that healeth thee, or
I am thy healer or Phyſitian:
Now what receipt giveth
he thee? this is it: call
on mee in the day of distreſſe.
               
               Secondly,2. Reaſon look but on
the ſoveraigne nature of
the medicine it ſelf, where
in it differenceth it ſelfe
from all other meanes of
life and godlineſſe: All other
meanes are ſanctified
by this, but this is the immediate
motion of the

ſpirit, of an unexpreſſible
vertue and irreſiſtible
force.
               Thirdly,3. Reaſon what glorious
things in Gods book are
ſpokē of this ineſtimable
peece of ſpirituall armes,
witneſſe S. Iames for all
the reſt, laying downe the
excellency of prayer, firſt
in generall termes, The effectuall
fervent prayer of a
righteous man prevaileth
much;
                  Iam. 5. 16. then hee inſtanceth
it in the prayers of Elias,
what great effects were
wrought by it. The devout
Ancients, hardly ſatisfie
themſelves in commending
this excellent
peece:Bernard. de med. 
                        •
                     . 7. 
                  There is nothing
(ſaith one) ſo ſenſibly ſweet
to the ſoule; nothing doth

weane the minde ſo much
from the loue of all this
world, nothing ſtirreth up
a man to the exerciſe of all
and every grace, nothing
prevaileth ſo much againſt
evill of ſin and evill of puniſhment,
whether for preſervation
or deliverance,
nothing standeth in better
ſteed for the increaſe of
Gods kingdome by the converſion
of ſoules; For as
prayer brake Peters fetters,
ſet open the priſon doore;
ſo it ſhaketh the chaines
of ſin in peeces, openeth
or breaketh up the iron
gates of a ſinners heart, &amp;
offers violence to heaven
for the enterance of a ſinner.
One of the Ancients
doth attribute Pauls converſion

to Stevens prayer,
Had not Steven prayed for
Paul (ſaith he) the Church
ſhould never have had
Paul for a teacher. In a
word, nothing maketh a
man ſo amiable to his
God, ſo deare and faithfull
to his friend, ſo formidable
to his foe, ſo contentfull
to himſelfe, and
ſo profitable to the place
where he liveth.
               Fourthly,4 Reaſon. all the people
of God in all their
ſtraits have made this
their Maſter-peece, and
proſpered by plying it;
were it famine, peſtilence,
ſword, captivity, contempt,
perſecution, or any
other evill to be feared or
inflicted, yea or evill of

ſin whereby God was offended
or the ſoule troubled,
did they not alwaies
fall hard on the worke of
petitioning; and did they
ever in ſincerity ſo doe &amp;
went away without a gracious
anſwer? Inſtance Iacob,
Moſes, Iehoſophat, Ezekias,
Manaſses, Samuel,
Eliah, the Cananitiſh woman,
the Publican, the
Theefe upon the Croſſe,
with many others, known
to the meaneſt reader of
the book of God. What
was Moſes his beſt fight
when Amaleck charged
Iſrael? Prevailed not this
ſword of prayer,Neglect of prayer argueth want of the ſpirit. more
then the ſword of Ioſhuah.
If this bee ſo then of the
excellency and efficacy of

prayer, why doe not men
run to it, and truſt to it in
the time of need? Becauſe
the ſpirit dwelleth not in
them: Every one that hath
but a ſhew of profeſſion,
yea &amp; prophane men too,
wil acknowledge the theory
or ſpeculative truth
thereof; but a woe it is to
ſee how few confirme it
by their practiſe: The
worſer ſort of men cannot
do this, if they would,
and the better ſort will
not doe it (to their ſhame
be it ſpoken) in that meaſure
and manner they
ſhould, and as the troubleſome
times require it:How the hypocrite uſeth prayer. and
for the hypocrite when
hee commeth into any
ſtrait, hee maketh a faire

ſhew in the fleſh at the
firſt onſet, bearing the
world in hand that hee eſteemeth
prayer aboue all
the meanes in the world;
but firſt his heart can tell
him that he relieth more
upon ſubordinate meanes
(which may and ought to
be uſed in their time and
place) and uſeth prayer
only for a triall of a concluſion,
which if it prove
not according to their expectation,
then farewell
prayer, they will have no
more to doe with it; they
look for good of it and
finde none, and not being
acquainted with the vertue
of it, they ſay of it as
the ignorant ſay of Chriſt,
What is this ſo much extolled

medicine more then another
medicine?
                  Cant. 5. 9. we have
tried it &amp; found no good
in it, but rather hurt by
neglecting the meanes; &amp;
therefore wee will uſe the
meanes that moſt prevails
amongſt men; &amp; for prayer
we will not altogether
caſt it out of doores, but
wee will lay it up in ſome
by-corner of the houſe, &amp;
reſerve it till it come in
requeſt; we will peruſe it
now and then, but this is
not time to truſt to it: In
this the hypocrite is like
one labouring of an inveterate
diſeaſe, who wil try
a litle of this mans skill &amp;
a litle of the others, but
will not ſet himſelfe to any
conſtant courſe of phyſick,

by which hee might
be perfectly cured, &amp; finding
no good by this
courſe, hee reſolveth peremptorily
never to take
any more Phyſick; yea
further, deſperately determineth
to forbeare nothing,
be it never ſo hurtfull,
but uſe every thing
that his minde giveth him
to: Iuſt ſo the hypocrite
in his diſtreſſe will have
about with prayer, &amp; fall
very freſh upon it for a fit
or a ſtart; but finding the
event not immediately to
anſwer his deſires, he fals
a quarrelling with it and
caſheeres it, with a reſolution
to attend it no further,
yea and not only caſteth
himſelfe upon the

ſubordinate meanes, but
imbraceth the worſt
meanes that the Divell
will offer him: A pregnant
inſtance wee have of
this in Saul, who in his diſtreſſe
made a ſeeking of
God (for he is ſaid to inquire
of the Lord;) But he
did it neither in ſincerity
nor conſtancy; and therefore
in another place he is
ſaid not to enquire at all,
he enquired not of the Lord;
for not to enquire of the
Lord in truth, is not to enquire
at all. But God not
vouchſafing him an anſwer,
hee commeth from
him to the Divell for an
anſwer. Let every ſoule
then put it ſelfe to triall
upon this point, whither

doſt thou goe in thy troubles?
whereon doſt thou
ſtay thy ſelfe? doſt thou
be take thy ſelfe to prayer?
doſt thou walke with this
ſtaffe over the rocky, ſteep
and invious mountaines
of thy diſtreſſefull troubles?
Then thou talkeſt
by the ſpirit, thou walkeſt
by the ſpirit, the ſpirit
protecteth and directeth
thee; though thy feet ſtick
faſt in the clay, &amp; thy ſoul
be ſunk in the pit, the Lord
will take thee out, and ſet
thy feet upon a rock. If
thy troubles (as Iob ſaith)
were more and heavier thē
the ſand of the ſea, yet the
Lord will eaſe thee, and deliver
thee: though all the
waves of the Lord goe over

thee, ply but the oares
of prayer, in the boat of
faith, and they ſhall neither
drowne thee in
the depth of deſpaire,
nor ſplit thee upon the
rock of Apoſtaſie: If all
thine enimies conſpire againſt
thee, and all thy
friends for ſake thee, bee
thou ever with God in
prayer, and God will ever
be with thee to preſerve
thee; yea in life and death
he will never forſake thee;
and this ſhall be an undeniable
evidence in thy
ſoules deepeſt diſtreſſe,
that God is with thee:
But if thou canſt be content
in thy trouble, onely
to make thy triall of praier,
and if thou findeſt not

preſent ſucceſſe to prefer
other meanes to this, and
yet thou wilt uſe this but
as if thou uſed it not, then
thou dealeſt in this caſe
as Achas dealt with the
Altar of God, He brought
in (as the Hiſtory telleth
us) the Altar of Damaſcus,
                  2. Kings from v. the 10. to 16.
                  whereon all his offerings,
and the offerings of the
people must be laid; but the
Altar of the Lord muſt
haue an inferiour place, and
be reſerved only to conſult
withall a litle for faſhion
ſake; So though thou
canſt bee content to prate
with praier, having given
it an inferiour place and
reſpect, yet all thy ſacrifices
are for the ſubordinate
meanes. As the Lord

abhorred Achas, and his
offerings, ſo will he never
look upon thee in this
caſe, nor on thy prayers
to doe thee any good:
Therefore looke to it as
thou loveſt to thriue: All
lawfull meanes (as I have
ſhewed) thou maiſt and
muſt uſe, becauſe the neglect
of them is a tempting
of God, but be ſure to uſe
them in ſubordination to
prayer, by which they
muſt bee either ſanctified
or ſupported, or they will
prove but rotten and deceitfull
reeds. But here by
the way, thou muſt obſerve
a neceſſary Caveat,Comfort for ſuch as cannot or dare not pray.
that Gods deareſt childrē
may bee ſo deaded with
diſtreſſe of ſoule, and preſſure

of afflictions, that
they cannot pray, or, as I
have ſhewed, ſo diſtempered
and diſtracted, that
they dare not pray; but
this may ſtay their heart,
that they would fain pray;
their heart beareth them
witneſſe, that they prize
nothing ſo much as prayer;
if they had all the
meanes in the world at
command, they will give
none the place of prayer;
yea they had rather pray
then be delivered. And
there is great reaſon, why
thus they ſhould eſteeme
of prayer, above all other
meanes, becauſe the greateſt
thing that they can effect,
is but hearts deſire,
in things like the meanes

themſelves: but prayer,
over and beſides, procureth
greater familiarity
with God, which is the
higheſt honour and the
richeſt profit, that the ſoul
can attain unto. A notable
inſtance wee have of
this in Daniel, who
though he underſtood by
holy Writ, that the time
of Ieruſalems deliverance
was come;
                  Dan. 9. 2. 23. yet he fals hard
to prayer, and that to his
great rejoycing: for the
Angell of the Lord becommeth
the Herald of
the Lords affliction towards
him, calling him a
man of deſires, or as it is
tranſlated, much beloved
or deſired of the Lord. So
if thou haſt aſſurance of

the thing deſired, yet
thou ſhouldeſt not ceaſe
to deſire it in prayer.
               It is further true, that
Gods deare people may
in the damp of their diſtreſſes
look more to the
ſubordinate meanes than
they ſhould, and leſſe to
prayer than they ought,
yea in this particular wee
may all lay our hands upon
our mouths, and with
ſhame enough confeſſe
our faultineſſe. In this we
labour of the ſquintneſſe
of the eye of the ſoule; for
as this is cauſed in the eye
of the body from looſeneſſe
of the muſcles or
nerves, or from inverſion
of the Chriſtaline humor,
or from the ſuddain ſight

ſome fearefull object; So
the other of the ſoule, ariſeth
from the weakneſſe
of Faith, the terrors without
and the feares within,
making us look a ſquint
upon that which ſhould
help us, and more directly
to that which cannot
help us: but the cauſe being
removed, &amp; the ſight
being rectified they looke
ſtreighter and more directly
upon the proper object:
or if you will, wee
may be compared to unadviſed
patients, who being
in a direct and approved
courſe of Phyſick, &amp;
not feeling ſuch preſent
good as they looke for,
they fall preſently upon
ſome Emperick medicin,

either from a Mountebanck
Foe or an ignorant
Friend; the evill and diſorder
whereof when they
begin to feele, they confeſſe
their errour and reſolve
thence forth to walk
by the rule: So the people
of God in their brainſick
fits count with Naaman
the rivers of Damaſcus
more medicinable thē
the rivers of Iſrael: but
upon better conſideration
they conceive and finde it
to be true, that one bucket
full of Iordan, is better thē
al the rivers of Damaſcus;
A few graines of the ſpirit
are of more force then
all the friends and means
whatſoever in the world.
And as a wiſe patiēt grown

wiſe to his coſt from foolery
and experimented evill
of a hurtful Medicine,
reſolveth hence forth to
cleave to a methodicall
courſe, and to die or live
by the Book; So the fooled
and aſhamed Chriſtian
by relying too much
upon ſubordinate means,
recalleth his wits, chideth
himſelf for his foolery, &amp;
reſolves for ever to make
more accompt of Prayer
then all meanes that the
whole world can afford
him.Our neglect of Prayer, relying on other meanes what evill it is unto us. And thrice happy
were the people of God
at this time, if wee could
now at length fall upon
the ſecond and ſounder
thoughts; for wofull experience
hath taught how

our more relying upon other
meanes than Prayer,
hath made God's Inheritance
every where a prey
to the enemy: When the
troubles firſt began, wee
took them to heart; wee
began togather our forces
together, and importune
God; but God denying
his eare (it may be not only
for the faults of our
perſons and Prayers, but
alſo to try our perſeverance)
we quickly give over,
leaving the cauſe and
the perſons as buried in
oblivion, caring litle or
nothing what become of
them or our ſelves: It is
no evidence of the Spirit
to begin to run, and to
break off in the mid way:

Naturall motions are the
ſwifter, the nigher they
come to their end. Is not
Prayer as powerfull as ever
it was to prevaile with
God? Have wee not to
doe with the ſame God
that heareth Prayer? Deſireth
he not to heare the
voice of his own, as much
as ever he did? Are not
ſuppliants now the men
of his deſire? Hateth hee
not his enemies as much
as ever he did? Have wee
not the ſame command,
the ſame promiſe? And
ſhall it not find the ſame
entertainment? Yes verily.
What is the cauſe then
the Lord is ſo farre from
us? Even becauſe wee are
ſo farre from him; we follow

not to the mark, wee
turne backe in the day of
battaile; wee endeavour
not by wreſtling to stay
the Lord, and not to let him
goe til he give us a bleſsing.
And how ſhould the
Lord be intreated of us?
We are like to Iohas King
of Iſrael in our Prayers,
who ſmote the ground (as
the man of God cōmanded)
with his arrowes, but
not often enough, &amp; therefore
the man of God was
wroth with him; for if hee
had ſmitten often enough
he ſhould have ſmitten the
Aſſyrians, till he had conſumed
them: So had wee
followed the buſineſſe in
the power of the Spirit
&amp; ſmitten often enough,

wee ſhould have ſmitten
the Babylonians til we had
conſumed them; but wee
have not done it, &amp; therefore
they prevaile: The
breaking off of Prayer,
and the negligent performance
of it, is a fearfull
evidence that God wil never
honour us with being
the means of their deliverance.
               But to leave them in
the pit, (for there they
are like to be for us,)
what ſhall wee ſay of our
ſelves, or what ſhall wee
doe for our ſelves? Wee
look indeed for peace,
                  Ier. 8. 15. (as
the Prophet ſaith) and for
a time of health, and behold
trouble;
                  Deut. 22. 25. And, to uſe Moſes
his words, Is not the

day of our calamity neere?
And doe not the things
that are threatned make
haſt? And what remedy,
namely this, to cry mightily
to God by continuance
in Prayers: Iohas,
though a wicked man,
knew reaſonable well the
worth of Prayer when he
gave the Prophet this teſtimony
on his deathbed,
weeping bitterly that
hee ſhould depart, O my
Father, the Charriots and
horſe-men of Iſrael! By
which ſpeech, what other
meant the King,2 King. 13. 14. then that
the Prophet and his Prayers
were of more worth
for the good of the ſtate,
then all the forces of the
Kingdome. One of the

Learned telleth us, that
the ſincere Prayers of an
old, weak, godly woman,
will prevaile more with
God for helpe from heaven
againſt the enemy,
then thouſands of armed
Souldiers in the field. But
with woe and griefe of
ſoule we may ſay, where
be the men that ſtand up in
the gappe to turne away the
wrath?
                  Exod. 32. 33. Who, with Moſes
offereth that violence
to God, that God ſhould
ſay to him, let me alone?
Who will ſtay by the
Lord as he did, and will
not off, nor goe one foote
till hee have the Lord to
goe with us? O how that
complaint of the Prophet
may pierce us to the

very heart;Eſay 64. 7. 
                  There is none
that calleth upon thy Name
nor ſtirreth up himſelfe to
take hold on thee! And
what followeth? even that
which partly is upon us,
and partly like to come
upon the, Thou haſt hid thy
face from us, and haſt conſumed
us becauſe of our iniquities.
Who is it now,
with the Spouſe in the
Canticles, that laieth hold
upon Chriſt till hee have
brought him into his Mothers
houſe?
                  Cant. 3. 4. Whereby is
meant both the Heart and
the Church, which is the
houſe of God: For there
indeed is Gods dwelling.
Let us awake then ſince
now is the trouble ſome
time, and draw nigh to

God;Hab. 2. 1. yea, let us stay our
ſelves upon the Tower, and
ſtand upon the watch to ſee
what the Lord will ſay unto
us: Though he be angry
with our Prayers let
us not give over, but let
us pray continually, not
returning againe to folly;
and wee may be ſure it
ſhall goe well with us in
the day of tryall.
               Another Evidence of
the Spirit on Prayer,11 Reſpect to order &amp; matter of Praier. is a
due reſpect had to the
Matter and Order of
Prayer: As to the former,
when they pray for nothing
but that which is
pleaſing to God:Rom. 8. 18. 
                  We know
not indeed of our ſelves
what to pray for, nor how
to pray, but the Spirit

teacheth us in both; againſt
that old and new Pelagian
Hereſie of mans abilility
in both duties, the
Spirit teacheth us to aske
that, and nothing but that,
which is agreeable to his
Will; for that hath the
promiſe and confidence
in the promiſes annexed
unto it: 1 Ioh. 5. 14. 
                  And this is the
confidence that we have in
him, that if wee aske any
thing according to his will,
he heareth us: So that the
Will of God muſt be the
Rule and Square of our
Prayers; God gave Salomon
his choice to ask what
hee would, yet Salomon
knew very well (as appeareth
by his choice) that1 King. 3. 5.
that was included according

to will: So that place
in Matthew is to be underſtood,Mat. 7.
                  Aske and it ſhall
be given you &amp;c. For wee
muſt take heed (as it there
followeth) that inſtead of
bread wee aske not ſtones,
nor a Scorpion inſtead of
fiſh, that is, hurtfull and
not lawful things, inſtead
of uſefull and lawful. The
man deſtitute of the Spirit
of God asketh ever amiſſe
                  Iam. 4. 3.
(as S. Iames ſaith) either
for quantity or quality,
or for ill ends; hee asketh
there that which is
naught in it ſelfe; or if it
be good it is not fit for
him; or if it might be fit
for him, if hee were ſuch
as he ſhould be, yet hee is
not fitted for it becauſe

he is not ſuch as he ſhould
be. I muſt confeſſe upon
wofull experience, that
the Children of God in
their Lunatick fits, fall often
foul upō theſe ſhelves
or ſandes: As for asking
things unlawfull; the Dilciples
would have fire
from heaven;
                  Luk. 9. 45. Mat. 20. 
                  Zebedees
ſons would ſit on the right
hand, and on the left of
Chriſt;
                  Pſal. 55. 
                  David would have
the wings of a Dove that
he might flie from his colours:
and ſo they aske
things not fitting for thē,
though to good intent,
and often they are not fitted
for the things they
aske. But thus they doe in
their haſt, the Word of
God checketh them;

Gods Spirit &amp; their owne
cōſcience diverteth them
from this courſe; and they
endeavour to ſquare their
deſires according to the
Will of God. But the
wicked are like to Elies
ſonnes, They will have
what they will, if they periſh
for it. Try thy Prayer
then by the object of thy
deſires; if thou canſt heartily
ſubmit thy ſelf to the
Will of God in all things,
then thou haſt aſſurance
of the guidance of the Spirit;
but if thou wilt be
both begger and chooſer,
thou art too ſaucy to
be guided by the Spirit.The order to be obſerved in Praier.
               
               Secōdly, as for the Matter
ſo they have due reſpect

unto the Order: The
Spirit whereby they are
guided, is a ſpirit of Order
&amp; not of confuſion. They
firſt ſeeke heaven and heavenly
things,1 Rule. becauſe they
are heavenly minded, according
to that rule of our
Saviour,Mat. 6. 33. 
                  Seek yee firſt the
Kingdome of God and his
righteouſneſse, and all theſe
things ſhall be added unto
you: where by the Kingdome
of God and his righteouſneſſe
is meant heaven
and all the means of Gods
appointment, that bring
us to heaven, which both
for excellency and order
we muſt ſeeke and eſteem
above &amp; before all things;
not but that wee may and
muſt ſeeke earthly things,

for there is a neceſſity of
them, we have the promiſes
for them, but it muſt
be as they are neceſſary
helps to the better things,
giving them their due
time and place: A pattern
for this our Saviour giveth
us in that perfect patterne
of Prayer, wherein
he teacheth us firſt to pray
for heavenly things, and
then for earthly things.
Where if any object,Ob. That
the asking of dayly bread
is prefixt to the asking of
forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, the
former being earthly, the
later heavenly;Anſwer I anſwer,
it is not needfull (with
ſome of the Fathers and
others) to expound this
bread of the ſacramentall

bread, for the temporall
bread is the bread of the
children (as one of them
well obſerveth) as well as
the ſpirituall bread; but
the petition for Bread is
put before the petition of
Remiſsion of ſins, as ſome
think, becauſe the former
of petitions is for good,
the later is in the number
of the deprecations for evill:
Others, that from the
ſight of our neceſſities of
earthly things, we are led
to a ſight of our neceſſity
of heavenly things: According
to this patterne is
the practice of the Saints;
Salomō
                   makes firſt choice
for Wiſdome,
                  1 King. 3. 9 and letteth
other things follow in
their courſe; David firſt

deſireth the light of Iehovah's
face or countenance,Pſal. 4.
and letteth the corne, and
the wine, and the oyle follow
in their order. But it
is nothing ſo with the
wicked, they deſire earthly
things in the firſt place
becauſe they are earthly
minded, as for heavenly
things, they never
queſtion the attaining
of them: Give Eſau
firſt his red pottage,
and let him deale afterward
for the birth-right
as hee can; let Saul be honoured
before the people,
and hee will take his venture
of the honour from
God.
               
               Againe,2 Rule. wee muſt aske
heavenly things abſolutely

(I meane in their kinds,
not in any particular meaſure
or quantity;) but for
earthly things wee muſt
aske them conditionally,
for ſo they are promiſed;
In ſome ſort, namely, ſo farre
as they are abſolutely
neceſſary for the maintaining
us in Gods ſervice,
and making good of his
promiſes, ſo farre wee
may crave them abſolutely;
for as wee crave the
end, ſo we may crave the
meanes that lead to that
end.
               Then try thy ſelfe by
the right ordering of thy
heart towards the object
of thy deſires; if thy heart
pant, and thy ſoule thirſteth
after the living God,

and the promiſes of God
Chriſt Ieſus: Doeſt thou
deſire the loving kindneſſe
of the Lord more
then Life it ſelfe, then let
this aſſure thee, though
thou want other aſſurance,
that thy deſires
are the deſires of the Spirit;
for every deſire is of
the nature of the thing
deſired: Beaſts affect only
ſenſuall objects, becauſe
their deſires are
meerly ſenſuall, and the
naturall man deſireth naturall
things as the adequat
object of his deſires,
though by ſome ſparkle
of common inſtinct
he may glance at better
things, which he neither
knoweth, nor truly affecteth.

So the Kingdome
of God and his righteouſneſſe
is the adequat object
of the ſpirituall mans deſires,
although the ſtomach
may be affected
with the maukin, or ſuch
a diſeaſe as women with-child
and men alſo labour
of, ariſing from an excrementious
or venemous,
humour, whereby they
long extremely for things
hurtfull, like the humour
it ſelfe, and deſire them
more then holſome food:
But as this is cured by vomiting,
ſo the Lord by
ſome croſſe or other purgeth
out his malignant
menſtrous humour, after
which they come to hate
their owne deſires: David
                  
was taken with a longing
                  2 Sam. 23.
                  deſire for the water of Bethlem,
but not when hee
perceived it to be the price
of blood; by hazarding the
lives of his worthies, hee
would not give it to his
deſires. So when the Saints
perceive their inordinate
deſires to hazard their eſteeme
&amp; deſire of Chirſt,
they ſay to them, as Ephraim
to his Idols, get
you hence, what have I to
doe with you? Look to it
then, for if thou ſet thine
eaſe, profit, pleaſures, honour,
or any thing elſe before
Chriſt, thy deſire is
not of Chriſt.
               The laſt note of Evidence
of the Spirit,12 Expectation of the thing deſired. is the
looking for an anſwer

from him to whom wee
pray: The end of every
action, is firſt in intention.
A man can never intend
that which hee lookes not
to ſee in execution; the end
of Prayer is to be heard:
Heare (O Lord) the Praier
of Iudah,
                  Deut. 33. 7. 
                  and bring him
unto his people: To heare is
no other thing but to anſwer;
he who prayeth then
intendeth to have anſwer,
looketh for an anſwer; it
will follow then by converſion,
that he that looketh
not for an anſwer,
prayeth not at all. That
ſpeech of the blind man,Ioh. 9.
                  God heareth ſinners, carririeth
theſe two things in
it; Firſt, as I have ſhewed,
the living in any ſinne cannot

ſtand with the Spirit
of Prayer: This hath been
the courſe of all the Saints:
Iacob looked for a bleſſing,
and hee would not away
without a bleſsing;
The Canaanitiſh Woman
will not away til ſhe have
ſomewhat, though it be
but crummes; David will
look out, that is, (as I have
ſhewed) he will waite for
an anſwer; My ſoule waiteth
for Iehovah,Pſal. 136. 6. 
                  more
then a watch-man for the
morning:
                  Pſal. 123. 2. 3. 
                  As the eyes of
ſervants are unto the hand
of their Masters, or as the
eyes of a Maiden unto the
hand of her Miſtreſſe; So
our eyes are toward Iehovah,
our God, untill that
he be gracious unto us: The

leadeth us unto this duty
by the very inſtinct of
brutiſh creatures; The eyes
of all looke attentively to
thee, and thou giveſt them
their meat in due ſeaſon.
                  Plin. l. 2. c. 4.
The Humaniſts tell of Oryx
a kind of Goat in Egypt,
that it is ſo affected
with the feare of ſcorching
heat at the riſing of
the dog-ſtarre, that it ſtandeth
with tears in the eies
looking up to the heavens,
as though it ſeemed
to deprecate the intolerable
fervency thereof, and
to thirſt with an unquenchable
deſire for
ſome moiſture from the
heavens: So the ſoule taken
up with deſire of that
it prayeth for, will waite

for it till it hath it: And
this is more then an unregenerate
man doth or can
doe; he hath not the promiſe,
which is the ground
of the anſwer, nor careth
he for the beſt things; how
then can hee wait for an
anſwer? He may conceit
that God wil anſwer him,
yea that hee doth anſwer
him, becauſe hee obtaineth
ſome earthly things,
but his conceit is groūdleſſe,
for God anſwereth
not his prayers neither
will he, though hee make
many prayers, although
it pleaſe God to caſt thoſe
things upon him for the
further convincing and
condemning of him: Put
thy ſoule therefore to it in

this particular, and looke
on thy prayer with like
or diſlike, according to
thy looking or not looking
for an anſwer.The Godly fail herein. Our
comming ſhort of this
maketh us come ſhort of
our ſuits for our ſelves &amp;
others; wee are like the
children that ſhoot their
ſhafts, &amp; never look after
them; or careleſſe petitioners,
who never look after
an anſwer of their petition:
This is one maine
cauſe of the Lords abſence
from his Church,
and of his ſtanding out

in that wee have not
waited ſtill on God, and
importun'd him for an
anſwer. Then let us ſet

our ſelves upon the wall
continually, to watch and
wait for it, and the Lord
in his due time will give
a gracious anſwer.
               If a wearied ſoule objectOb.
his waiting for an anſwer
till his eyes hath failed,
and his heart fainted;
               I anſwer,Anſw. if thy ſuit
hath the promiſe for its
ground, thou ſhalt have it,
for God denieth not what
he delayeth, yea in this
he anſwereth thee that he
ſtayeth thy heart to looke
for anſwer; for therein he
anſwereth the heart,
though he anſwereth not
the hand, hee knitteth thy
heart unto him that it doe
not depart from him. But
if thou haſt no promiſe

for thy particular, then
know, that deniall is the
very beſt anſwer; for private
bleſſings are every
way as good as poſitive.
               Thus much I hope ſhalThe Concluſion of this particular.
ſerve for the particular
markes of the Grones of
the Spirit, which in ſome
meaſure are in all Gods
children. All theſe marks
indeed, or, at the leaſt,
ſome of them be very cō
                  ſpicuous;
yet through diſuſe
or neglect the characters
may be mightily raced,
and illegible, moſſegrown
with the cares of
this life, and the remnants
of carnality, hypocriſy, &amp;
ſecurity, yet they are not
quite raced out, ſo that
they are not there at all;

but in the unregenerate
they are not at all, or in any
meaſure. I have beene
the larger in thē, becauſe
of the deceitfulneſſe of
the heart, the neglect of
triall, the preſumption of
hypocrites and prophane
men, and for ſtirring up of
Gods people to look better
to it, that they may
not only pray in the ſpirit
in ſome meaſure, but alſo
that they may pray in
ſenſe of the ſpirit, which
is the third Point in order
to be handled.

                  BEFORE IQueſt.
come to open
this particular,
it
ſhall not be
amiſſe to anſwer a queſtion
which I heard moved;
Whether a man without
the Spirit, eſpecially underſtand
cloſe hypocrites,
may goe frequently and
ordinarily to God in ſecret,
becauſe all other objects
and by-reſpects removed,
the ſoule commeth

in a more direct aſpect
to talke with God?Anſwer
               
               For anſwer hereunto, I
muſt acknowledge, that
as the prayer of the wicked
is never mentioned
but with profeſſed deteſtation
of it, ſo I never
read of any prayer of the
wicked in ſecret; But the
Phariſees, the very picture
of hypocrites, are
reproved for turning the
courſe of ſecret prayer to
publique oſtentation: It
is diſcovered in the Scripture
to be the practice of
the Saints;Gen. 24. 63. 
                  Iſaac went out
into the fields with deepe
meditation (for ſo the
word ſignifieth.) It was
Daniels ordinary practice
to goe into his chamber
                  Dan. 6i 10.
                  
                  three times a day to pray;
So David,
                  Pſ. 55. 17. 33. 4. 
                  evening and
morning and at noone will
I meditate;
                  Act. 10. 9. And at the ſixt
houre Peter went into prayer.
Laſtly,Luk. 6. 12. it was the frequent
practice of Chriſt
himſelfe, the pattern of all
goodneſſe: yet notwithſtanding
all theſe, a prophane
man may ſtumble
now and then on his knees
before God, as a nightwalker
may a dangerous
way in his ſleep, not
knowing what danger he
is in, yea a cloſe hypocrite
may ſo harden his face againſt
the feare of Gods
preſence, or upon ſome
ſelfe-fantaſticall ground
of libertiniſme, liue in
groſſe ſinnes, one or more

&amp; goe ordinarily to God
in ſecret, which the Lord
in judgement doth ſuffer
for a time, that they may
be hardned in ſin, and clothed
with judgement as
with a robe, but failing of
their ends, or their ends
or their ſin being diſcovered,
they fall off from the
practice to open Prophaneſſe,
Apoſtaſie of profeſſion,
or Terror of conſcience,
which is the beſt
that can befall them.
               Now having anſwered
this Queſtion, I come
directly to the point it
ſelfe, namely, The meanes
of attaining the ſenſe of the
Spirit in prayer: For as
many think they pray, &amp;
yet pray not at all; ſo many

pray indeed, and doe
not belieue they pray. As
it is the higheſt happines
of the ſoule to converſe
with God in prayer, ſo is
it the heavenlieſt conſolation
of the ſoule, to know
it ſelfe to bee converſant
with God in prayer: Now
for the attainment of this,
thou muſt,
               1 Firſt ſtir up and quicken
the motion of the ſpirit:
As in nature, Motion
ſtirreth up naturall heat,
and naturall heat maintaineth
Motion, making the
part moved more ſenſible
of livelineſſe, and activity;
ſo the ſtirring up of any
ſpirituall faculty, maketh
it more active &amp; agile,
and the activity thereof

maintaines the vigor of
the faculty, and maketh
the ſubject more ſenſible
of its own activity: It is
directly ſo in prayer; to
this the Apoſtle is very
pertinent,1. Tim. 1. 6 
                  Stir up the gift
that is in thee. The property
of the word is to
ſtir up the ſparkles of fire,
covered as it were with
aſhes, and by laying fuell
to them, to kindle them
up, and make them burne
again. So that if thou
wouldſt feele the heat of
the ſpirit, thou muſt by a
devout indeavour &amp; carefull
aſſiduity, gather together
the ſparkles of the
ſpirituall motions, raked
up in the aſhes of corruption,
and the rubbiſh of

careleſſe neglect, and by
laying on the fuell of the
grones of the ſpirit, with
the ſoft breath of the bellows
of heavenly meditations,
thou muſt reſuſcitate
and kindle up againe
that ſpirituall fire, which
is like to be extinguiſhed.
The neglect of this maketh
want of ſenſe, and
want of ſenſe want of
comfort; and therefore
(as the Apoſtle ſaith) neglect
not, or be not careleſſe
of the gift that is in thee.
If ever then thou wouldſt
have comfort from the
ſenſe of prayer, dig thy
ſelfe out of thine own ſecurity,
dull not, neither
drowne thy pretious
thoughts in cares, pleaſures,

worldly joyes, or
ſorrowes; be ever bringing
the diſperſed ſparkles
of the Spirit together, and
like a good workmā, look
well to the fire, and then
the Lord will not onely
take notice of thy prayer,
as he did of Pauls, but hee
will alſo give thy ſoule to
know, that it is ſuch a
prayer as he taketh notice
of; ſo that thou maiſt cōfidently
averre with David,
I have called upon thee, &amp;
maiſt urge it with an argument,Pſ. 31. 18.
                  let mee not bee confounded.
               
               2 The ſecond Mean of
procuring ſenſe, is the removing
of hinderances,
as the diſtemper of the
body by intemperancy,

the diſtemper of the ſoule
by paſſion, dividing cares
or looſe and unprofitable
company; theſe bee the
rubbiſh of our ruinous diſpoſition,
that keep us frō
the view of the ſtraine of
prayer in us: Theſe be the
aſhes that cover the ſparkles
of the Spirit, &amp; keep
us from the ſenſible heat
of them. Away then with
theſe if thou deſireſt the
ſenſe of the vigor of the
Spirit! Firſt the ſoule followeth
the temperature
of the body; thou muſt
labour, as much as may
be, for a ſound minde in a
well tempered body: The
over-wearied, and over-toyled
bodies, whereunto
moſt men reſerve their families

and ſecret duties,
are unfit to organize the
ſoule, or to vent the ſoul's
deſires in prayer; It is
good therefore to ply the
duty in health, &amp; ſtrength
of body, that hence comfort
may ariſe in time of
ſickneſſe, and weakneſſe.
As for the Paſſions or
Perturbatiōs of the mind,
if they be the ſymptomes
of evill affected bodies,
the body muſt be brought
in frame; but if they bee
the more ſpiritual perturbations,
or ſuch turbulent
commotions as wee call
properly the ſickneſſe of
the minde, as anguiſh, ſlaviſh
feare, ſadneſſe, &amp; the
like, theſe being of an aëreall
and ſubtile nature,

doe trouble and miſcarry
the temper, as the winde
doth carry the calmeſt
ayre and ſmootheſt water
againſt the rocks: So that
for want of ſmooth waters
to move on (if you
will) a well-compoſed
minde, the evidence of the
Spirit, can neither be ſeen
nor heard. Therefore
theſe perturbations muſt
be alayed by their oppoſite.
Graces, (as I have
ſhewed) not quite taken
away, with the Stoicks,
but they muſt bee ſo tempered
and alaied by grace,
above the temper of the
Platoniſts, that they may
be as ſinews to the motion
of the Spirit, whereby
evidence may bee furthered,

and not hindered. As
for inſtance; an angry or
wrathfull diſpoſition, is
like choler, diſtaſting or
diſtempering the relliſh of
the Spirit; or as the unnaturall
heat doth waſt and
conſume the naturall active
heat that commeth
from the heart; ſo the devouring
heat of anger eateth
up the evidence of
the Spirit. The minde (as
one ſaith) must be at peace
in it ſelfe, if it look towards
God: But if the heat of anger
be turned into a holy
zeal, tempered with diſcretion,
it will conſume
that rubbiſh that lyeth in
the way of ſenſe, and will
be like a coach to carry
the evidence or feeling of

the Spirit to our Spirit in
the time of prayer.
               Secondly, And ſo a habit
of dulneſſe or penſive
heavineſſe, dulleth &amp; flatteth
the ſenſe of the ſpirit
in prayer, but a well ſet or
moderate mournfulneſſe,
is that ſowing in teares,
which maketh us ſenſible
in prayer to reap in joy.
Laſtly diſtracting and ſlaviſh
feare doth weaken
the ſenſe of Gods love towards
us, but a reverent
awe of the Majeſty of
God in prayer, will give
thy ſoule aſſurance, that
he is thy Father, and that
by the power of the ſpirit,
thou calleſt him ſo.
               Thirdly, As for the removeall
of any reigning

ſin, I have ſpoke of it before,
for continuance in
that cannot ſtand with
the Spirit of prayer; yea I
am of that minde, that
though David loſt not the
Spirit by his ſin, it is probable
that he prayed not
ſcarce all the time that he
lay in his ſin.
               A third Mean to attain
ſenſe of the Spirit in prayer,
is in thy diſpoſition to
the duty, and deſire to bee
guided by the ſpirit, and
not by the fleſh &amp; blood.
In thine indiſpoſition, or
averſe diſpoſition, it will
diſſwade thee from praying
at all, and that upon
ſome ſhew of probable
ground, as that thou haſt
not the Spirit, thou canſt

not pray, God will not
entertain it, If any bee by
thou maiſt ſhame thy ſelf,
and bewray thee to bee a
man of no gifts; So thou
hadſt beſt let it alone till
thou be fitted, God will
accept of thy good intention,
and better not pray
at all, then not to pray excellently:
But theſe, &amp; the
like be ſophiſticall ſuggeſtions,
whereunto if thou
hearkneſt, thou neglecteſt
thy duty, thou weakneſt
thy prayer by thy neglect,
thou diſacquainteſt
thy ſelfe with God, thou
bewraieſt a doting on
thine own ability, thou intercepteſt
Gods opportunity
of manifeſting his
ſtrength in thy weakneſſe,

thou giveſt advantage to
Sathan, thou indangereſt
the very habit of prayer
as much as in thee lyeth;
for from frequency of
neglect thou maiſt derelinquiſh
the duty, or bring
it to a bare preſumptory
performance. Laſtly, there
is nothing that weakneth,
depriveth, and oppoſeth
ſenſe more then this: for
as a ſedentary life; or ſleeping
after meat, bringeth
a fat cold body to a Palſie
or Lethargie, wherein
ſenſe and motion is often
weakned or deprived; ſo
the neglect of duty may
indanger ſenſe to a mans
dying day. Therefore if
thou canſt not pray as
thou wouldeſt, or as thou

ſhouldſt, pray yet as thou
canſt; God may bee there
and thou not aware of it:
and when thou art leaſt able,
thou art moſt able; &amp;
when thou art moſt humble,
thou art fitteſt for
ſenſe: &amp; take this as the direction
of the Spirit in
many places beſides the
practice of the Saints:Eph. 6. 19. 
                  Pray
alwaies;
                  Col. 4. 2. 
                  Continue in prayer:
                  Rom. 12. 12.
                  Watch and pray alwaies:
                  Luk. 21. 36
The meaning of which
places wee muſt not miſtake
(after the example of
Euchytes the Pſallian) that
we muſt doe nothing but
pray, (for many evills
would then ariſe) but that
upon all occaſions wee
ſhould have ſomething to
ſay to God, eſpecially as

both ancient and modern
obſerve, at the ſtinted
times of duty, which
though wee change, yet
we muſt not neglect or omit,
whether private or
ſecret. In a word, that of
the Apoſtle in another
caſe, though often by ſin
abuſed, will ſerve well
here,2. Tim. 4. 2 
                  Be inſtant in ſeaſon
and out of ſeaſon; that is,
whether it pleaſe or pleaſe
not: So whether thou art
diſpoſed or not diſpoſed,
goe to, and doe it; the
Lord hath bidden thee.
               The fourth Meane in
Prayer to obtaine ſence, is
the labouring in Prayer
to bring home Chriſt ſenſibly
to the ſoule: This is
the Spouſes deſire, I would

lead thee, I would bring
thee into my mothers houſe:
And thus ſhe doth indeed;
I held him and would not
let him goe until I brought
him into my mothers houſe;
which is no other but to
bring him into the heart,
where hee dwelleth by
Faith. As the Conduit-pipe
bringeth home water
from the Fountaine to
the Ciſterne, ſo the Conduit
of Faith bringeth
home the Fountaine of living
water, even Chriſt
himſelfe, to the Ciſterne
of the heart. As the eye
of Faith in Prayer looketh
for Chriſt, ſo the hand
of faith bringeth him
home, for faith is a thrifty
grace, bringing all riches

home to the ſoule. The
want of this thrifty courſe
maketh want of ſenſe in
our ſuits to God; for as
the light of Gods truth
bringeth home to the ſoul
the Mountaine of his holineſſe,
ſo the Spirit of
Prayer bringeth home
the Lord to the ſoule of
an humbled ſinner. If a
man could fill the Cenſer
with odors, and the heavens
with Groanēs, and
labour not in particular
for this Vnion or Contract
between God &amp; his
Soule, God may be there
with litle or no immediate
ſenſe of his preſence:
Look then to the plying
of this; for this will make
thee to remove every

thing that may diſpleaſe
the faithfull witneſſe, or
weaken ſenſe.
               A fift Mean to procure
ſenſe, is a due notice-taking
of God &amp; our ſelves
in Prayer: The knowledge
of our ſelves, Moral, Naturall,
and Spirituall, caſteth
us quite out of our
ſelves, and leadeth us (as
one ſaith) as it were by the
hand to the knowledge of
God; by which reflection
or circular knowledge we
come to be vile in our
owne eyes: It caſteth out
and keepeth out ſin, making
the Spirit rejoyce to
beare witneſſe with our
Spirits, that our Prayers
are as odors of incenſe in
his noſtrills. Againe, the

Spirituall knowledge of
Gods Excellency, Soveraignty,
Al-ſufficiency of
all his Attributes and
workes, worketh a lively
ſenſe in the Suiter, becauſe
the bare naturall or ſupernaturall
knowledge of
God, be it as may be, will
never beget any ſenſe
without that anointing
eye-ſalve. This knowledg
then of Gods Excellency
will countervail the ſenſe
of thine owne unworthineſſe,
his Soveraignty will
command the rebellion
thereof: His All-ſufficiency
ſupplyeth thy wants;
all his attributes, yea, even
his Iuſtice (in Chriſt) ſerveth
for thy good; This
knowledge giveth thee

not only (with the heathen)
ſome light to ſee
God in his Creatures.
The truth of this paſſage
appeareth plainly in Abraham
his ſuite to God
for Sodome; I have taken
upon me, or begun to ſpeak
unto the Lord, and I am
duſt and aſhes, whereby a
reflective knowledge of
God upon him ſelfe, hee
ſeeth and acknowledgeth
himſelfe to be nothing:
yet by this is not diſcouraged
but rather encouraged
to continue his requeſt,
renuing it to the
number of nine times,
which hee could never
have done without the
ſenſe of the Spirits approbation.
               
                  
Our comming ſhort
herein maketh us come
ſhort of ſenſe in Prayer,
for either we examine not
our ſelves, and empty not
our ſelves of our ſelves as
we ſhould, till we be vile
in our own eyes, &amp; therefore
the Lord will not let
us know that hee taketh
notice of us, till we take
better notice of our ſelves;
or on the contrary, wee
fixe both our eyes upon
our owne unworthineſſe,
vileneſſe, and inſufficiency,
where finding no matter
of feeling, wee drench
our ſelves in teares of deſpair
with S. Iohn, becauſe
there is nothing found in
us worthy to give teſtimony:Rev. 5. 4.
But we looke not

up to the Lyons power,
nor the worth of the
Lambes blood, by which
the ſealed evidence of the
Fathers good will is opened
or broken up to us,
by whom the Odors or
Prayers of the Saints are
carried up to the Father,
and to the Fathers preſence,
and evidence of his
preſence is brought down
into the ſoule. And this is
the means to make us ſing
that new ſong with triumphant
joy and melody in
ovr heart, having God in
Chriſt to be all in all unto
us, though wee be nothing
of our ſelves.
               The ſixt and laſt ſenſe-procuring
Meane, is a
cloſe and conſtant holy

walking with God in all
our Thoughts, Words, &amp;
Actions, both in our generall
and particular calling.
The guidance of the
Spirit, Praying by the Spirit,
and Evidence of the
Spirit (in ſome meaſure)
goe uſually together; (I
ſay uſually) becauſe ſometime
the two firſt may be
without the laſt, and that
for cauſes beſt knowne to
God, as ſome ſinne paſt,
prevention of ſome ſinne,
as ſpirituall pride, or the
like; or for the tryall of
the patience of the Saints,
and their continuance in
Prayer, trusting in the
Lord, although hee ſhould
kill them: And truly I may
ſay for the comfort of

ſuch, that though it be not
ſo ſweet a condition as
that which is joyned with
ſenſe, yet it is as happy &amp;
as ſure a condition as that
which is carried by ſenſe,
if all meanes for ſenſe be
uſed. Hither may I apply
that ſaying of our Saviour
to Thomas,
                  Ioh 20. 29. 
                  Thou beleeveſt
becauſe thou ſeest, bleſſed
are thoſe that have not
ſeen and yet have beleeved:
So, bleſſed are thoſe that
continue in Praier, though
they want the ſenſe of aſſurance
in Prayer.
               But to the matter in
hand, cloſe obedience out
of Prayer, bringeth good
Evidence in Prayer, not
only as the effect, or as
the fruit evidenceth the

tree, but it challengeth the
Spirit of promiſe to be
with us in Prayer, to give
Evidence and Approbation
to his owne Worke:
For as remiſſe walking in
a Chriſtian (though not
abſolutely looſe) doth in
ſome ſort quench the Spirit
and damp the evidence
thereof in Prayer; ſo a
cloſe, ſtrict, and holy walking
with God, doth quicken
and rejoyce the Spirit,
for that it is ready with
cheerfulneſſe to give joyfull
evidence, when wee
goe about its particular
buſineſſe of Prayer. This
walking with God (for
which the Patriarchs and
Saints were commended)
is nothing elſe (as the Author

to the Hebrewes expoundeth
it) but a pleaſing
of God by faith and obedience:
Now when we
thus pleaſe him, hee (according
to his covenant
made to Ahraham and his
ſeed,) is with us in our requeſts,
by giving us contentment
of aſſurance. But
our want of this, maketh
weakneſſe of Prayer, and
want of aſſurance: Many
mens affections are led
captive and their judgments;
wee preſume our
wayes to be Gods wayes,
when they are none of
his; by being ſtrict in one
of the Tables, we take liberty
to tranſgreſſe the other:
The harmony of the
Spirit is diſtempered by

our diſordered paſſions;
we beare falſe witneſſe againſt
God in denying
the Saints their due, out
of a partiall humour, and
therefore it is juſt with
God to withdraw his teſtimony
from our requeſts,
though we eagerly
deſire it. Laſtly, the
hearts of the moſt profeſſing,
are ſo overcharged
with the cares of this life,
that the Spirit alſo is overcharged
with the dulneſſe
&amp; deadneſſe of their
Prayers, whereby the duty
hath ſmall force with it
and the evidence is ſuppreſſed:
Therefore looke
to thy walking in every
particular, if ever thou
meaneſt to attaine to aſſurance

in thy Prayer.
               Other meanes I might
deliver for the obtaining
of ſenſe, as due Preparation
to Praier, a Habit of holy
ejaculations, but I have
already ſpoke of the former,
and will only adde
this, Withdraw thy ſelfe
from all impediments, &amp;
prepare thy ſelfe with a
reverent awe to meet thy
God: And for the later,
Theſe holy breathings, as
ayre, keepe and cleere the
fire upon the hearth,
whereby ſenſe is kindled
when thou ſetteſt upon
the worke: Alſo for helpe
in this particular, the frequent
uſe of ſecret Prayer
will doe well; David (as I
have ſhewed) ſought the

Lord three times a day; we
ſhould of neceſſity be
twice a day with God at
the leaſt, beſides going
unto him upon other occaſions,
as hearing of the
Word, or others, remembirng
alſo to double our
Sacrifice on the Lord's
Day. And ſo much for
the Meanes, which if the
Lord diſpoſe thy heart to
uſe conſcionably, thou
canſt not but obtain ſome
good meaſure of aſſurance,
that thou praieſt by
the Holy Ghoſt.
            
            
               
               4 How a man ſhould hold
on in the duty without
the ſenſe of the Spirit.
               
                  
                     THe fourth particular
head of
of this Treatiſe,
                  Quaeſt.
                  ſhall be the ſatisfying
a demand: If one
feele not the aſsurance of
the Spirit in Prayer, with
what comfort or encouragement
ſhall that party hold
on in Prayer, or ſhould hee
reſolve to give over Prayer,
as Ieremy reſolved to
give over preaching?
               For anſwer,Anſ. let ſuch a
one neither reſolve ſo nor

doe ſo: As for motives of
encouragement thereunto;
Firſt, thou muſt doe it
in conſcience to the commandement,
joyned with
a promiſe, Call upon me in
the day of trouble and I wil
deliver thee: What greater
trouble then to be
without ſenſe of aſſurance
in Prayer, and when is deliverance
nigher then in
great trouble?
               Secondly, remember
that hee, to whom thou
goeſt, is a loving, kind, and
compaſſionate Father,
who pittieth his children,
and will not ſuffer them
to cry alwaies without an
anſwer, he will not hide his
face for ever. If evill parents
wil give good things

to their children, yea, and
that to evil children: much
more wil he who is goodneſſe
it ſelfe give better
things to ſuch as hee hath
made partakers of his
goodneſſe.
               Thirdly, take encouragement
from earneſt
deſire of Gods face that
he hath put into thy heart
which hee never meaneth
to fruſtrate, for hee granteth
the deſires of his
children. Thou art as ſurely
happy (as I have ſhewed)
though not ſo ſenſibly
happy, in hungring
and thirſting after ſenſe,
as though thy ſoule were
filled with ſenſe: Theſe
deſires are his owne, and
he will crowne his owne

works with mercy &amp; tender
compaſſion; keep then
but open thy mouth and
heart in Prayer, and aſſuredly
as he hath promiſed
he wil fil them with good
things.
               Fourthly, comfort thy
ſelfe with this thy deſertion
or want of ſenſe; it
may be it is not yet Gods
opportunity to ſhew himſelfe
in the Mount, it may
come in an houre which
thou never didſt looke
for.
               Fiftly, let the Wiſdome
of God ſtay thee in
thy courſe, who hath all
times and ſeaſons in his
hands, who knoweth
when to ſhut and when to
open: By which drawing

his preſence, hee maketh
thee to long the more after
it, and the more thou
wilt value it when thou
haſt it.
               Sixtly, let the examples
of all Gods children
in this comfort thee: didſt
thou ever know or heare
that ever any of them periſhed,
but at length they
found the thing they
ſought for?
               Laſtly, let thine owne
experience teach thee to
run thy race with patience,
till thou doſt obtain:
For though thou haſt not
the ſenſe of his preſence,
yet thou haſt other fruits
of his preſence, as Holineſſe,
Humility, Patience,
Brotherly-love, Softneſſe

of heart, Tenderneſſe of
conſcience,Pſal. 4. Feare to diſpleaſe,
a Reverent awe of
God, Hunger and Thirſt
after all righteouſneſſe.
Theſe, it may be, or ſome
of theſe thou haſt in a
greater meaſure thē ſome
that have ſenſe: But howſoever,
theſe be the harbingers
of ſenſe, &amp; where
they take up the heart,
there ſenſe of aſſurance
wil be ſure to lodge: Thou
haſt already that witneſſe
in thy ſelfe, namely the
Spirit, and that Spirit will
make thee know the
things that are of God.
            
            
               
               5 How ſuch as want the
the Spirit of Prayer ſhould
labour for it.
               
                  THE fift and
laſt particular
of this Treatiſe,
is how
men that want
this Spirit of Prayer ſhall
attain unto it; For all men
have it not, not the elect
till they be converted,
although moſt thinke that
every man in the face of
the Church can pray, yet
nothing leſſe. It is true indeed
that our bleſſed Saviour
maketh interceſſion

by his preſence for the Elect,
even before their
converſion, witneſſe himſelfe;
neither pray I for
theſe alone,
                  Ioh. 17. 20 
                  but for them alſo
that ſhall beleeve on me
through their word: where
the ancients obſerve, that
Chriſt prayed not only
for thoſe that ſhould hear
the Apoſtles (for neither
Abraham nor the Theife
heard) but hee prayed for
all them that from the beginning
of the world had
beleeved or ſhould beleeve:
yet for all this hee
prayeth in none before
they have the Spirit.
Though Paul, an elect
veſſell, before his converſion
had the Prayer of
Chriſt, yet he prayed not

for himſelfe till hee was
transformed by the Spirit
into the Image of Chriſt,
by whoſe Spirit he began
to pray, of the truth of
whoſe Prayer Chriſt giveth
this teſtimony;Act. 9. 10. 
                  behold
he prayeth: Vnregenerate
men may perhaps
peruſe this draught of
Prayer, whereby as they
come to ſee the neceſſity
of Prayer, ſo they may
diſcerne the falacy of the
fleſh and Sathans ſuggeſtions,
in perſwading men
that they pray when they
doe nothing leſſe, &amp; hereupon
they come to enquire,
how they may attaine
to the true gift of
Prayer?
               
               For anſwer, let them

underſtand, firſt, that Praier
is no acquired gift by
the induſtry of man, but
an infuſed ability of the
Spirit (as I have ſhewed,)
which God, out of the
free motive of his love,
powreth upon all and every
one of his choſen,
when hee worketh that
glorious change in them
by the power of the Gopell.
The wind bloweth
where it listeth, and thou
heareſt the ſound thereof,
but canſt not tell whence it
commeth nor whither it goeth:
So is every one that
is borne of the Spirit. As
this is ſpoken of the free
and forcible myſtery of
mans converſion, incomprehenſible
by mans capacity,

yet underſtood of
faith; ſo this Spirit of ſupplication
maketh free and
forcible entry upon the
heart of a convert, neither
acquired, nor truly
deſired, nor underſtood
by the beſt man in
his naturall eſtate, or
moſt compleate endowments,
before his converſion.
               Further, ſince thou
doeſt enquire alſo in thy
caſe with thoſe that came
to Iob, what thou ſhouldſt
doe, I anſwer, thou muſt
know &amp; ingeniouſly confeſſe,
that thou canſt not
pray at all; for men conceit
that they can pray,
when they can doe nothing
leſſe: And this reachcheth

not only to carnall
profeſſours, who hold it
a hereſie to doubt that
they cannot pray to God,
but alſo to cloſe and formall
hypocrites, yea temporary
profeſſours in the
higheſt degree, whoſe
hearts fouly deceive thē
in this particular. The cō
                  ceit
of the proud Phariſee
amongſt the reſt of his
faults, that he could pray
and none like him, ſpoiled
him for ever from praying.
To men ſo conceited
that ſaying of the Phyſitian
well agreeth: When
the minds of men are once
takē up with falſ opinions,
they make them not only
deaf but alſo blind againſt
the truth it ſelfe: yea further

ſaith hee, there is no
tincture ſo indelible, ſtaining
the judgement of well
ruled reaſon; for their arrogancy
and ignorance
combine themſelves together:
Even juſt ſo it is
with men in this particular;
yea I dare avouch that
this conceit maketh ſuch
further off from prayer
then prophane Infidells
that never offered to pray
in all theit lives. It is related
of a skilfull Muſitian,
that hee tooke twice as
much for teaching thoſe
that were evill taught, as
for thoſe that were not
taught at all; becauſe a
falſe poſition in a ſcience
is a greater hinderance to
the attainment thereof,

then the pure privation of
it: if ever then thou deſireſt
to pray, confeſſe ingeniouſly
that thou canſt
not pray at all; know that
thou art ſtark blinde and
lame, that thou maiſt receive
thy limbs and ſight.
               In the next place, thou
muſt lay to heart and bee
ſenſible of thy miſerable
and wretched condition,
through want of this precious
gift of prayer: this
well conſidered will make
thee at thy wits end, and
it will ſhake the ſandy
foundation of all thy endeavours,
it will batter &amp;
take the fort of all thy
vain confidence, it wil cut
the ſinews of all thy ſelfe
deceiving policy, it will

faint the heart, and dead
the very ſoule of all thy
pale-faced hopes, it will
imbitter the ſweetneſſe of
al thy ratſ-bane pleaſures,
it will mar the market of
all thy poſſeſſions &amp; treaſures,
it will bring off the
hooks all thy jollity and
mirth, it will make thee
behold, as in a true glaſſe,
all thy jollity and madde
mirth, it will let thee ſee
the vanity of all thy great
friends, favorites, ſupporters,
lovers, acquaintance,
yea the Ioviall companions.
In a word, if thou
wilt hold to it, it will give
thee no reſt till thou haſt
found ſome other footing
for thy ſoul to reſt on.
               To make all good, let

me a litle expoſtulate the
matter with thee: What
canſt thou doe in the day
of thy diſtreſſe, when
trouble comes upon thee,
like paine on a woman in
child-birth? When thy
cōſcience begins to roare,
thy ſoul to faint, thy ſtate
to waſt or bee taken from
thee by violence? Whither
canſt thou goe? Wilt
thou know what thou
canſt doe? I know, &amp; thou
ſhalt know it, thou canſt
doe juſt nothing for thy
ſelfe that good is. If thou
canſt not pray, thou canſt
goe no where at all out of
thy ſelfe; to him thou
canſt not goe that hath eternall
life, for thou art
not acquainted with him,

thou haſt no odours to
fill the Cenſer, and therefore
hee hath nothing for
thee but a Cenſer full of
fire from the Altar to cō
                  ſume
thee: here thou maiſt
know (if thou wilt) that
thou art blind, and naked,
miſerable and wretched.
But what is the remedy?
where is the refuge? who
is thy ſhelter in this thy
diſtreſſe? Surely if thou
canſt not pray, thou maiſt
look about thee, within
thee, aboue thee, beneath
thee, and finde no remedy,
refuge, or helpe: For
thou haſt no promiſe of
all theſe in calling upon
God, no promiſe of deliverance,
as I have ſhewed:
yea inſtead thereof, thou

haſt the arrow of the Lords
wrath drawn (even to the
head) againſt thee;
                  Pſ. 50. 15. 79. 6. witnes
the Pſalmiſt; powre out thy
wrathfull heat againſt the
heathen that know thee not,
and upon the kingdomes
that cal not upon thy name.
The very ſame phraſe
hath Ieremy, calling them
the Families that call not
on thy name;
                  Ier. 10. 25. whether it be
family, kingdome, or perſon,
all is one. Further,
what canſt thou doe for
thy family, if famine, fire,
plague▪ or fearefull ſickneſſe
come amongſt thē?
If thou canſt pray juſt ſo
much as thou canſt doe
for thy ſelfe, yea if they
were all running to hell,
which is worſe then the

former, thou neither canſt
nor wilt ſtay them, but rather
haſten them thither.
Obſerve this I beſeech
thee, as thou art husband
or wife, parent or childe,
maſter or ſervant; what
canſt thou doe for thy
country, when the diſmal
day of calamity thickens
in upon it as a cloud, and
the evill threatned maketh
hast.
                  Deut. 32. 35. Though thou art the
moſt civiliz'd formaliſt
in all the world, the cloſeſt
hypocrite, the moſt
gliſtring moraliſt, yea the
moſt potent grandie for
ſtate and puiſſance in all
the land, and yet canſt not
pray, thou makeſt many
breaches, and openeſt many
gaps to the betraying

of the ſtate and kingdome
but thou canſtnot for thy
heart, by ſword or counſell
protect the State, frō
the leaſt enſuing danger.
An evill man may by
Gods imployment bee a
fort or Cannon, yet hee
hath neither the promiſe
nor any good by it: It is
the poore wiſe man that
by his wiſdome delivereth
the City, though no
man regard him; for fools
can doe no good; &amp; fooles
are all ſuch as cannot
pray: for they ſpend all
time in learning ſtrange
language, but have never
a word of the language of
Canaan.
                  Miſery in ſicknes, &amp; death with out prayer. Laſtly, what canſt
thou doe when ſickneſſe
ſeazeth on the, and death,

the laſt enimy looketh
gaſtly in thy face? Then
all thy worldly confidence,
policy, hopes, pleaſures,
profits, poſſeſſions,
joviallity, mirth, favourers,
freinds (and what
not) ſhall forſake thee:
then one groane or ſigh
from the ſpirit, would
bring thee better newes
from God, then if all the
Princes Embaſſadours in
in the world ſhould ſalute
thee Maſter, or their Soveraign
and ſole Monarch
of the world: But this
Embaſſie of prayer being
wanting, what woe will
be wāting, yea thou maiſt
wiſh the hills and mountaines
to overwhelme thee
and cover thee from the

preſence of him that ſitteth
upon the throne; but
all in vaine, if the Lord
put not words in thy
mouth, whereby hee may
be entreated, thou ſhalt either
dye deſperately like
Iudas, or with thy heart
dying within thee, like
Nabal: So conſider this
ſtrait wherein thou art, &amp;
this may put thee further
on to ſet thine eyes towards
the Lord.
               But ſome deſperately
may objectOb. (for ſuch
there bee) if the ſenſe of
ones ſtate that cannot
pray, ſet him ſo upon the
rack, it were better for
ſuch a one to content
himſelfe with ſuch prayers
as have ſerved him hitherto,

then by medling
after a new ſtrain of prayer
to make life uncomfortable
and death intollerable.
               For anſwer,Anſwer the remedy
is worſe then the diſeaſe;
for if ſuch a one ſee it not
in time, he ſhall ſee it will
be one time or other, yea
it may bee out of time,
greater horrour. I have
been the larger in this
particular, that the terror
of a non-ſuppliant eſtate
might haſten him out of
it, yea I think verily if ſuch
men would look well upon
it, it might be a meane
to bring many out of it.
Thou muſt reſolve in the
third place if ever thou
wouldſt pray to break off

thy ſins, and to part with
thy prophaneſſe; for as I
have ſhewed, a ſinfull
courſe &amp; familiarity with
God cannot conſiſt or
ſtand together: A corrupt
tongue or leprous throat
maketh a harſh noiſe in the
eare of God:
                  Prov. 15. 29. remēber that
the Lord is far from the
wicked, and though they
cry to him he wil not harken
to them;
               Fourthly, thou muſt avoid
and abandon all prophane,
idle, and unprofitable
company; for as thy
living in a corrupt ayre,
or with contagious bodies,
will increaſe the habit
of thy corrupt diſpoſition,
till thou be utterly
conſumed; ſo lewd and

wicked company will
more and more contaminate
thy ſoule, and ſpirit,
ſo that thy breath ſhall
ſtink worſer and worſer in
the noſtrills of God: As
the ſoule in the Law that
touched any abominable
unclean thing,
                  Lev. 21. 
                  and ate of
the ſacrifice, was to bee cut
off from Gods people, ſo the
converſing and familiarity
with unclean &amp; curſed
company, cutteth a ſoule
off, &amp; keepeth it off from
familiarity with God in
prayer;Prov. 4. 14 Therefore (ſaith
the wiſeman) Enter not
into the path of the wicked,
and goe not into the way of
evill men:
                  Pſ. 26. 5. 6. The Prophet
David, waſhing his hands
in innocēcy, that he might

compaſse the Altar of the
Lord, abandoneth all vain
perſons, &amp; reſolveth not
to ſit or converſe with the
wicked: for as thou muſt
avoid evill company, and
hate them that regard lying
vanities,
                  Pro. 13. 20. ſo thou muſt
aſſociate thy ſelfe to the
godly. Hee that walketh
with the wiſe ſhal be wiſe;
hate the evill (ſaith the
Prophet) and love the
good.
                  Amos. 5. 14. The meerely moral
man doth counſel thee
to converſe with ſuch as
will make thee better, as
men by conſtant converſing
with natives of a Nation
doe learne the language
of the nation; ſo by
ſorting thy ſelf with beggers
thou maiſt happily
learne to beg.
               
                  
Fiftly, thou muſt intreat
the godly earneſtly
to pray for thee, and to
beg thee of the Lord, eſteem
much of their praiers,
which be of that efficacy
to convert a ſinner
from his waies, and to ſave
a ſoule from death, hiding
a multitude of ſinnes. If
thus thou doſt, and God
affecteth the hearts of his
people to pray for thee,
there is good hope that
thou ſhalt come to pray
for thy ſelfe and for others
alſo; for the Sonne
of many prayers cā hardly
periſh: but ſo long as
thou doſt ſcoffe &amp; mock
at the prayers of the
Saints, or haſt them in
light eſteem, the ſpirit of

prayer or ſupplication
will not come nigh thee.
Yet with this begging of
the prayers of the Saints,
thou maiſt learne to beg
thy ſelfe. The people of
Iſrael deſired Samuel to
pray for them when they
had ſinned; but they praied
alſo for themſelves;
but Pharaoh deſired Moſes
to pray againe and againe
for him, but hee
would never learne to
pray for himſelfe, neither
did he at all deſire Moſes
his prayer,Exod. 8. 8. till the hand of
God was the ſecond time
upon him, for at the firſt
he did not. A great many
doe never deſire the praiers
of Gods people; if
they deſire them at all, it

is not till Gods hand be ſo
heavy upon thē, that they
know not what to doe.
               Sixtly, thou muſt attend
the meanes of the
word, read, preached and
conferred upon, for thou
ſhalt never learne to ſpeak
to God, except thou heareſt
God ſpeak unto thee:
hee that turnes away his
eare from hearing the
Law, even his prayer ſhall
be abomination; It is not
a ſet manner in a ſecret
corner, nor the beſt penned
praier that thou canſt
get by hart, without a diligent
attendance on the
word, eſpecially preached,
that ever will teach or
inable thee to pray: For
faith commeth by hearing;

And becauſe wee believe
therefore we ſpeak: As the
lame man in the Goſpell
lay ſtill by the Poole of
Betheſda (which was the
meanes appointed for recovery)
till the power of
God had wrought upon
him, ſo thou muſt ſtill attend
the meanes, till God
ſmite the heart, unvail the
eyes, touch and untie the
tongue to this duty of
prayer.
               Seventhly and laſtly,
enquire &amp; learn of God's
people, and they can tell
thee what unvaluable profit,
what ſweet pleaſures,
what unſpeakable conſolation,
what peace-paſſing
underſtanding, what
height of honour, what

heaven of happineſſe, they
find in this familiar conference,
with God; aske
and they will tell thee (as a
Father obſerveth) that of
all vertues they can find
none but this compared to
incenſe. Secondly, they
can tell thee on experience,
that it is the beſt
guard againſt all aſſaults
of Sinne and Sathan. All
kind of Divels are kept
out and caſt out by this.
When the evill Spirit
came upon Saul,
                  1. Sam. 16. 23. 
                  David alayed
and abandoned it
by playing on his harpe;
that harpe, ſaith one, was
devout Prayer: Thirdly,
if thou wouldſt know
what is the beſt trading,
Gods people will tel thee

there is none like Prayer:
For no ſtate, time, place,
perſon, or oppoſition, can
intercept thrift if thou
art diſpoſed to pray; thou
maiſt ever be imploying
thy ſtock, and that with
the returne of encreaſe;
thou maiſt gain more by
Prayer, in one houre (as
one ſaith well) then all the
Merchants in the world
in a thouſand yeares.
Fourthly, wilt thou know
what is the very beſt phyſick?
Gods people can tell
thee by experience, that
none is like Prayer: It healeth
the infirmities of the
body, and the diſeaſes of
the ſoule, and the Praiers
of the faithfull ſhall ſave
the Sicklie, and the Lord

ſhall raiſe them up,
                  Iam. 5. 15. 
                  and if
he have committed ſinnes
they ſhall be forgiven him:
Fiftly, if it be enquired
what is the greateſt honour
that mortall man
can obtaine unto? Is it not
this, for a man to talke familiarly
with God as with
his friend? And ſuch honour
have all the Saints,
and they only: What honour
were it for a poore,
meane, deſpicable man
to come to be ſo inward
with a great Monarch to
have his eare at his pleaſure,
and to goe into the
bed-chamber when hee
liſt without repulſe or interruption
of any? So is it
with Gods favorites, how
deſpicable, and deſpiſed

ſoever they be amongſt
men: Hee that will be inward
with God (ſaith one)
let him pray frequently; let
him read diligently; for
when we ſpeak with God,
when wee read or heare,
God ſpeaketh to us. Sixtly,
if thou wouldſt be provided
of the beſt armes againſt
thine enemies, of
the beſt, ſafeſt refuge in
diſtreſſe, the ſpeedieſt deliverance
out of trouble,
the Saints can aſſure thee
upon experience, that
there is none like this: witneſſe
Moſes, Hester, Iehoſaphat
and the reſt. Seventhly,
wouldſt thou
command all the armes
of creatures, as heaven &amp;
earth and all the creatures

therein, yea, even the Angels
themſelves, the people
of God wil teach thee,
that Prayer is the only
word of command. By
this Elijah did open and
ſhut the heavens; By this
Moſes tied and untied the
hands of the Almighty;
by this Iacob made the
Lord to ſtay with him, ſo
that hee could not depart
till hee had bleſſed him.
Eighthly and laſtly in a
word, wouldſt thou have
a guide that might direct
thee, and protect thee, aſſiſt
thee, and never leave
thee till thou art brought
through this troubleſome
vale to the life of
glory, the Saints can aſſure
thee, that Prayer is

the only meane to bring
the guidance of the Spirit
into the heart, and there
to continue it, till thou
commeſt to thy journies
end; theſe effects of Prayer
who can chooſe but affect?
               Now if thou doeſt fall
in love with the Fruits,
thou maiſt haply endeavor
to get the Tree into the
garden of thy ſoul, which
will make all the ground
fruitful. Theſe rules being
obſerved by thee, and the
motives conſidered, thou
art in a fair poſſibility, to
come acquainted with
God, by whoſe mercy &amp;
guidance I have been led
along in this litle Treatiſe:
deſiring for the Cōcluſion

nothing but this, that
God may have the
honour, &amp; his
People the
profit.
