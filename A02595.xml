            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               THE VNIon
of the two noble and illustre
famelies of Lancastre &amp; Yorke,
beeyng long in continual discension
for the croune of this noble realme,
with all the actes done in bothe the
tymes of the Princes, bothe of the
one linage and of the other, beginnyng
at the tyme of kyng
Henry the fowerth, the
first aucthor of this
deuision▪ and so
successiuely
proceadyng
to the reigne of the high and
prudent prince kyng Henry the
eight, the vndubitate flower
and very heire of both
the sayd linages.
1548.
         
         
            
            
            ¶To the most mightie, verteous and excellent prince
Edward the sixt, by the grace of God, kyng of England, Fraunce and
Ireland, defendor of the Catholike faith, and vnder God supreme hed,
of the churches of England and Ireland. Your moste humble
subiect Edward Halle, wisheth health, honor and felicitie.
            
               OBliuion the cancard enemie
to Fame and renoune
the suckyng serpēt of auncient
memory, the dedly darte to the
glory of princes, and the defacer
of all conquestes and notable
actes, so muche bare rule
in the firste and seconde age of
the worlde, that nothyng was
set out to mennes knowledge
ether how the world was made
either howe man and beastes
wer created, or how the worlde
was destroyed by water til father
Moses had by deuine inspiraciō
in the third age, inuented letters, the treasure of memorie, and
set furth fine notable bokes, to the greate comfort of all people liuyng
at this daie. Likewise Mercurie in Egipte inuented letters and writyng,
whiche Eadmus after brought in to Grece. So euery naciō was
desirous to enhaunce lady Fame, and to suppresse that dedly beast Obliuiō.
For what diuersitie is betwene a noble prince &amp; a poore begger,
ye a reasonable man and a brute beast, it after their death there be left
of theim no remembrance or token. So that euidently it appereth that
Fame is the triumphe of glory, and memory by litterature is the verie
dilator and setter furth of Fame. How muche therfore are princes, gouernoures
and noble menne bounde to theim whiche haue so liuely set
furth the liues and actes of their parentes, that all though thei bee ded
by mortall death, yet thei by writyng and Fame liue and bee continually
present. If no man had written the goodnesse of noble Augustus,
nor the pitie of mercifull Traian, how shoulde their successours
haue folowed ther steppes in vertue and princely qualities: on the contrarie
parte, if the crueltie of Nero, the vngracious life of Caligula
had not beene put in remembrance, young Princes and fraile gouernors
might likewise haue fallen in a like pit, but by redyng their vices
and seyng their mischeueous ende, thei bee compelled to leaue their euill
waies, and embrace the good qualities of notable princes and prudent
gouernours: Thus, writyng is the keye to enduce vertue, and represse
vice, Thus memorie maketh menne ded many a thousande yer
                  •
               
still to liue as though thei wer present: Thus Fame triumpheth vpon
death, and renoune vpon Obliuion, and all by reason of writyng and
historie.
            
               
Alas my soueraigne Lorde, my herte lamenteh to knowe and remembre
what rule this tyrante Obliuion bare in this realme, in the
tyme of the Britons. For from the first habitacion of this land, no man
of the Britons ether set furthe historie of their begynnyng, or wrote the
hole liues of their princes &amp; kynges, excepte Gildas whiche inueighed
against the euill doynges of a fewe tyrantes and euill gouernours. In
so muche that Cesar writeth, that when he was in this realme, the people
could not tel their linage, nor their begynnyng. But one Geffrey of
Monmothe a thousand yere and more after Iulius Cesar, translated
a certayn Britishe or Welshe boke, conteinyng the commyng of Brute
with the sequele of his linage, till the tyme of Cadwalader, whiche Britishe
boke if it had slept a litle lenger, Brute with al his posteritie had
ben buried in the poke of Obliuion, for lacke of writyng.
            The strong Saxons, after thei had gayned this lande, set vp the
bāner of Fame, and had their liues notably writtē by diuerse and sundery
famous clerkes, euen from their firste entery into this lande, till
the firste Monarchy, and so sucessyuely. In the Normans tyme, many
notable woorkes hath been set furthe, some of one prince perticulerly,
and some of mo: So that in fine, all the stories of kynges, from kyng
Willyam the firste, to kyng Edward the third, bee set 
                  •
               urthe at length
by diuerse authours in the Latin toungue, as by Matthewe of Paris
sometyme religious in saincte Albons and other. After whome Ihon
Frossart wrote the liues of kyng Edward the third, and kyng Richard
the seconde, so compendeously and so largely, that if there were not so
many thynges spoken of in his long woorkes, I might beleue all written
in his greate volumes to bee as trewe as the Gospell. But I haue
redde an olde Prouerbe, whiche saithe, that in many woordes, a lye or
twayne sone maie scape. Sithe the ende of Frossarte whiche endeth at
the begynnyng of kyng Henry the fourthe, no man in the Englishe
toungue, hath either set furth their honors accordyng to their desertes,
nor yet declared many notable actes worthy of memorie dooen in the
tyme of seuen Kynges, whiche after kyng Richarde succeded: Excepte
Robert Fabian and one with out name, whiche wrote the common English
Chronicle, men worthy to be praysed for their diligence, but farre
shotyng wide from the butte of an historie.
            Wherfore moste drad and benigne souereigne Lord, lest cancarde
Obliuion should deface the glory of these seuen Princes, to whom you
be of all sides lineall heire and very enheritour, I haue compiled and
gathered (and not made) out of diuerse writers, as well forayn as Englishe,
this simple treatise whiche I haue named the vnion of the noble
houses of Lancaster and Yorke, conioyned together by the godly mariage
of your moste noble graundfather, and your verteous grandmother.
For as kyng henry the fourthe was the beginnyng and rote of the
great discord and deuision: so was the godly matrimony, the final ende
of all discencions, titles and debates.
            
               
Besechyng your highe Maiestie, to take this my simple and rube
woorke, accordyng to your accustomed goodnesse in good part, not regardyng
the thyng, but my good will to my natiue countree, whose
fame for lacke of writyng may muche be darkened and defaced,
and thus I pray to the celestiall Lorde to send you victorie
ouer your enemies, Peace with your confederates,
loue of your subiectes: and
in conclusion, perpetuall ioye &amp;
❧ eternall felicitee ❧

               I Must craue of the most gentle reader,
charitably to iudge of me the imprinter
of this worke, if ought herin shalbe
sene vnto the of purpose to bee omitted
either not sufficiently delated and set
furth, or elles somethyng to playnly

that thou wilt excuse me therin,
for I professe that I haue as nere as
in me lay, nether altered nor added any
thyng of my selfe in the whole woorke,
otherwise thē the aucthor writ thesame.
But this is to be noted, that the Aucthor
therof, who though not to al mē, yet to many very wel knowē, was
a man in the later tyme of his lyfe not so paynfull and studious as before
he had ben: wherefore he perfited and writt this historie no farther
then to the foure and twentie yere of kyng Henry the eight: the rest he
left noted in diuers and many pamphletes and papers, whych so digently
&amp; truly as I coulde, I gathered thesame together, &amp; haue
in suchewise compiled them, as may after thesaied yeres, apere
in this woorke: but vtterly without any addicion
of myne. Therfore my request and desyr as a
foresaied, is, that thou wilt truly aud charitably
iudge me: And so sone as my
leasure wil serue, for thine ease
&amp; ready fyndyng of any
thyng herein conteyned
I purpose
to gather an exact table

Germany and Denmarke, all christians at this daie can well declare.
And the Turke can bere good testimony, whiche by the discord of christen
princes hath amplified greatly his seigniory and dominion. But
what miserie, what murder, and what execrable plagues this famous
region hath suffered by the deuision and discencion of the renoumed
houses of Lancastre and Yorke, my witte cannot comprehende nor my

all regions whiche by deuisiō and discencion be vexed, molested and

whiche before by the temptacion of the subtle serpente, was from hym
segregate and deuided. By the vnion of the catholike churche and the
outworne sinagoge, not only the hard ceremonies and dedly peines of
the Mosaicall law wer clerely abholished and made frustrate, but also

By the vnion of man &amp; woman in the holy Sacrament of Matrimony
the generacion is blessed, and the synne of the body clene extincte &amp; put

exalted, and loue betwene countree and countree is norished. By coniuncciō
of matrimony, malice is extinct, amitie is embraced, and indissoluble
aliance and consanguinite is procured. What profite, what cō

fornamed two noble families, you shall apparantly perceiue by the sequele
of this rude and vnlearned history. And because there can be no
vnion or agrement but in respect of a deuision, it is consequent to resō
that I manifest to you not onely the originall cause and foūtain of the

               FOR the whiche you shall vnderstande (accordyng as it is in an

Henry the seuenth whiche espoused lady Elizabeth the heire of the illustre
family of Yorke, by the whiche mariage the deuise or badge of
the hous of Lancastre whiche was the redde Rose, was vnite and ioyned
with the white Rose, whiche was the cognisance and ensigne of the
noble progeny of Yorke, as by the genealogy conteigned in the ende of
this woorke more plainly shall appere.
            
               ❧ This aforenamed Henry erle of Darby beeyng created alitle before
duke of Herfforde, aprudente and politike persone, but not more
politike then welbeloued, and yet not so welbeloued of all, as of some
highly disdayned, began to consider with hymself how that kyng Richarde
his cosyn germaine was nowe brought to that trade of liuyng
that he litle or nothyng regarded the counsaill of his vncles, nor of other
graue and sadde persones, but did all thyng at his pleasure, settyng
his will and appetite in stede of lawe and reason. Wherefore on
a daie beeyng in the compaigny of Thomas Mowbrey firste duke of
Norffolke and erle Marshall, beganne to breake his mynde to hym
more for dolour and lamentacion, then for malice or displeasure, rehersyng
howe that kyng Richarde litle estemed and lesse regarded the nobles
and Princes of his realme, and as muche as laie in hym soughte
occasions, inuented causes and practised priuely howe to destroye the
more part of theim: to some thretenyng death, to other manacyng exile
and banishment, forgettyng and not remembryng what blotte it was
to his honor, and what detrimente and damage it was to the publike
wealthe, to suffre his realme to l
                  •
               se the aunciente fame and pristinate
renoume by his slouth and negligence, and that all thynges bothe in

the tyme of peace, and also of warre, aswell in the realme as without,
waxed worsse and worsse, and had neuer prosperous successe nor fortunate
conclusion. And because noble menne murmured, and the comon
people grudged, and all menne wondered at his vnprincely doynges,
he desired the duke of Norffolke, whiche was one of the kynges priuy
counsaill and well heard with hym, to aduise the kyng to turne the lefe
and to take a better lesson. When the Duke of Norffolke had heard
fully his deuise, he toke it not in good parte, but rekened yt he had gotten
a praie by the whiche he should obtayne greater fauor of the kyng
then euer he had, and so he at that tyme dissimuled the matter (as he
was in deede bothe a depe dissimuler and a pleasaunte flaterer.) And
after when he had oportunite and sawe his tyme, was very glad (as
tell tales and scicophantes bee, when thei haue any thyng to instill in
to the eares and heddes of Princes) to declare to the kyng what he had
heard, and to agrauate and make the offence the greater, he muche
more added but nothyng diminished.
            
               ❧ This matter somewhat quickened and more tikeled the waueryng
mynd of kyng Richard, and brought hym into a great fury. But when
the water of fumitory was well disgested in his stomacke, he determined
to here bothe the parties indifferently, and called to hym the duke
of Lancastre and his counsaill, and also the dukes of Herfforde and
Norffolk, &amp; caused the accusor to report opēly the wordes to him declared,
whiche rehersed theim again as he had before related to the kyng
When Duke Henry heard the tale otherwise reported then he ether
thought or saied, somwhat vnquieted for the noueltie of the thyng, or
troubled with anger for the vntruth of the matter, stode stil &amp; paused a
good while lokyng stedfastly vpō the king. And after y• takyng a good
corage to hym, makyng low obeisāce, besought his highnes to cōceiue
no mistrust in hym til he had seen &amp; herd more. Then turnyng hymself
to his accuser, declared worde by worde what he had said shewyng the
cause &amp; occasion why he so spake, deniyng fiersly al the other new inuē
               cions
alleged &amp; proponed to his charge: affirmyng y• if the kyng would
permit &amp; suffre hym he would proue his accusor vntrue, vniust &amp; afalse
forger of lies &amp; sedicious tales by the stroke of a spere &amp; dēt of a swerd.
The duke of Norffolke affirmed constantly his saiyng to be true &amp; refused
not the cōbate. The kyng demaunded of them if thei would agre
betwene themselfes, whiche thei both denied and threw doune their gages,
by my truth ꝙ the kyng, if you of your selfes will not agre I will
not study how to agre you: and then he graūted thē the battaill &amp; assigned
the place to be at the citee of Couentree in the moneth of August
next ensuyng, where he caused a sūpteous theatre and listes royal gorgeously
to be prepared. At the day apointed the .ij. valiant dukes cā to
Couentre, accōpanied with the nobles &amp; gentiles of their linages whiche
theim encoraged &amp; hertened to the vtmoste. At the day of the cōbate
and fight, the duke of Aumarle that daie high counstable, and theduke
of Surrey that daie high Marshall of England entred into the listes

with a great cōpany of men apareled in silke sendall embrodered with
siluer both richely and curiously, euery man hauyng a tipped staffe to
kepe the feld in order. About the tyme of prime came to the barriers of
the listes, the duke of Herfford mounted on a white corser barbed with
blewe and grene veluet embrodered sumpteously with Swannes and
Antelopes of goldsmithes worke, armed at all poinctes. The Constable
and Marshall came to the barriers, demaundyng of hym what he
was, he answered: I am Henry of Lancastre duke of Herfford, whiche
am come hether to dooe my deuoyre against Thomas Mowbrey duke
of Norffolke as a traytor vntrew to God, the kyng, his realme and me
Then incontinent he sware vpō the holy Euangelistes that his quarel
was trewe and iust, and vpon that poyncte he desired to entre into the
listes. Then he put vp his swearde whiche before he helde naked in his
hande, and put doune his viser, made a crosse on his forhed, and with
spere in hand entered into the listes, and discended from his horsse and
set hym doune in a chayer of grene veluet whiche was set in a trauers
of grene and blewe veluet at the one ende of the listes, and there reposed
hymself expectyng and abydyng the commyng of his aduersye.
Sone after hym entered into the felde with greate pompe Kyng
Richard accompaignied with all the pecres of his realme, and in his
compaignie was therle of sent Paule, whiche was come out of Fraūce
in post to se this chalenge performed. The kyng had aboue ten thousand
persones in harnesse, least some fraie or tumultie might spryng emongest
his nobles by parttakyng or quarellyng. When the kyng
was set on his stage whiche was richely hanged and pleasantly adorned.
A Kyng at Armes made open proclamacion, prohibityng all
menne in the name of the kyng and the high Constable and Marshall
to enterprise or attempte to approche or touche any parte of the listes
vpon payne of death, except such as were apoyncted to ordre and marshall
the felde. The proclamacion ended, another Herald cried: behold
here Henry of Lancastre duke of Herfford appellant, whiche is entered
into the listes royall to dooe his deuoyre against Thomas Mowbray
duke of Norffolke defendante, vpon payne to bee proued falce and recreant.
The duke of Norffolke houered on horsebacke at the entery of
the listes, his horse beyng barbed with crimosen veluet embrodered richely
with Lions of siluer and Mulbery trees, and when he had made
his othe before the Constable and Marshall that his quarell was iust
and trewe, he entered the felde manfully saiyng aloude, God aide hym
that hath the righte, and then he departed from his horse &amp; satte doune
in his chayer whiche was Crimosen Ueluet, cortened aboute with
white and redde Damaske. The lorde Marshall vewed their speres to
see that thei were of egall length, and deliuered the one spere hymself
to the duke of Herfforde, and sente the other spere to the duke of Norffolke
by a knighte. Then the Heraulte proclaymed that the trauerses
and chayers of the Champions should bee remoued, commaundyng
theim on the Kynges behalfe to mounte on horssebacke and

adresse themselfes to the battaill and combate. The duke of Herfforde
was quickely horssed and closed his bauier and caste his spere into the
rest &amp; when the trūpet, soūded, set forward coragiously toward his enemy
.vj. or .vij. paces. The duke of Norffolke was not fully set forward
whē the kyng cast doune his warder &amp; the heraultes cried ho, ho. Then
the kyng caused their speres to be taken from them, and commaunded
them to repaire again to their chayers, where thei remained two long
houres, while the kyng and his counsaill deliberatly consulted what
waie was best to bee taken in so waighty a cause. Then the Heraltes
cried silence and sir Ihon Borcy secretary to the kyng red the sentence
and determinacion of the kyng and his counsaill in a long rolle, pronounsyng
it after this maner. My lordes and masters I intimate and
notify to you by the kyng &amp; his counsail, that Hēry of Lancastre duke
of Herfforde appellante: and Thomas duke of Norffolke defendante,
haue honorably and valiantly apered here within the listes royal this
daie, &amp; haue been redy to darraine the battaill like two valiant knightes
and hardy chāpions, but because the matter is greate and weighty
betwene these two greate princes, this is the ordre of the kyng and his
counsaill, that Henry duke of Herfford for diuerse consideracions and
because he hath displeased the kyng, shall within .xv. daies departe out
of the realme for terme of ten yeres, without returnyng excepte by the
kyng he be repealed again and that vpon pain of death. When the people
whiche hertely loued the duke of Herfford heard this crie, thei wer
not a litle amased, &amp; marueled muche that he which had doen his deuor
to the performance of his chalenge should be thus banished and exiled
Then the herault cried again oyes, &amp; the secretary declared that Thomas
Mowbrey duke of Norffolke by the ordināce of the kyng and his
coūsaill because that he had sowen sedicion in this realme by his wordes
wherof he can make no proffe, shall a voide the realme of England
and dwel in Hūgery, Beame, Pruce or where he list, &amp; to neuer returne
again into Englande nor approche the cōfines nor borders of thesame
vpon pain of death, and that the kyng would staie the profites and reuenewes
of his landes in his handes till he had receiued suche somes
of money as the duke had taken vp of the kynges treasorer for the wages
of the garison of Caleis whiche wer still vnpaied. When these iudgemētes
wer thus deuulged, the kyng called before him the two exiles
and made thē swere that the one should neuer come into the place wher
the other was (willyngly) nor kepe company together in any forren region,
whiche oth thei receiued humbly and departed from the listes. It
was supposed that the kyng mistrusted that if thei two should ioyne in
one again, and conspire to be reuenged against him, that thei and their
frendes might woorke hym greate trouble and calamitee, and for that
cause to haue deuised this othe. The duke of Norffolke whiche supposed
to haue been borne out by the kyng, was sore repentant of his enterprise,
and departed sorowfully out of the realme into Almaine, and at
the laste came to Uenice where he for thoughte and Melancoly deceassed,

The duke or Herfforde tooke his leaue of y• kyng at Elthā,The Duke of Harforde banished the realme. whiche
there released foure yeres of his banishment. And so he tooke hys
iourney &amp; came to Caleis, &amp; so into Fraunce, wher he continued a while
            Wondreful it is to write, and more straunge to here, what nombre of
people ranne in euery towne &amp; strete, lamenting and bewailyng his departure:
As who woulde say that whē he departed, the onely shelde, defēce
&amp; comfort of the cōmē people was vadid &amp; gone, as though y• sōne
had fallē out of the spere, or ye moone had lapsed frō her proper epicicle.
            When he was arriued in Fraunce, kyng Charles hearyng the cause
of his banishement, whiche he estemed verye small and lighte, receaued
hym gently, &amp; hym honorably entreteyned: In somuche that he had by
fauour obteined the mariage of the onli doughter of Ihō duke of Berry
vncle to the Frenche kyng, if kyng Richard had not cast astoppe in
his waie: For he well considered howe the comminaltie loued the duke,
and how desirous thei were of his returne into England, and then forseyng
that if he should bee ioyned with so great an affinite as the blood
of the house of Berry was in Fraunce, &amp; afterward sodeinly to returne
into Englande, it might fortune to redounde to his more displeasoure
then pleasour, wherefore he letted the mariage to his owne distruction.

ye cathedral churche of seint Paul in Londō. The death of this duke abbreuiated
the life of king Richard, for he notwithstāding ye the duchy of
Lancaster was to this duke Henry laufully discended, not onlye seazed
without ryght or title all the goodes of duke Ihon his parent, but also
defrauded his heire of his laufull inheritaunce, receauing the rentes
and reuenues of al his patrimony, and geuing to other that which was
not his, &amp; distributed the dukes landes to his paresites and flattereing
foloers. This facte was adiudged to al the nobilitee to bee vnlaufull,
vniust &amp; vngodlye, to depriue a man beyng banished out of y• realme
without deserte, without culpe, and without cause, of his inheritaunce
and patrimony: but Edmund duke of Yorke vncle to Henry now lawfully
duke of Lancastre, was sore moued with thys chaunce to see the
kyng breake and violate all lawes, all iustice and equite and after the
murther of his brother the duke of Glocestre, to spoyle and robbe the
sonne of his other brother. For he before this tyme asmuch as his pacience
could beare, did tollerate and suffer the death of his brother, the
exile of his nephiew, and an hundred mo iniuries, whiche for the leuitie
and youth of the kyng, he remitted and buried in obliuion. And therefore
consideryng that the glorye of the publique wealthe of his natiue
countree was like to decay by reason that ye kyng was not moste ingenious,
&amp; had no man nere hym that wolde boldely admonishe hym of
his office &amp; duetie, thought it the acte of a wiseman in tyme to get him
to a resting place and to leaue the folowing of such a doubtful capitain
whiche with a leadē sworde wold cut his owne throte bolle. Wherfore

he with the Duke of Aumarle his sonne went to his house at Langley,
reioysyng that there was nothing in the common wealth mishappened
either by his deuice or consent, and daily he lamentably desired aide of
almightie God to turne away from kyng Richard the darke cloude
whiche he sawe hangyng ouer his head.
            In this season kyng Richard sailed into Irelād as diuers aucthors
testifie▪ but what he did there,Kyng Richard sailed into Ireland. is no parte of my processe, whiche dependeth
on the sequele of this deuision. Whyle kyng Richard was in Irelande,
the graue persones of the nobilitie, the sage prelates of ye clergy,
the sad Magestrates &amp; rulers of the cities, tounes &amp; comminaltie, perceiuyng
daily more &amp; more the realme to fall into ruine &amp; desolacion (in
maner irrecurable as long as kyng Richard either liued or reigned,)
after long deliberacion, wrote into Fraunce to duke Henry, whom they
nowe called (as he was in dede) duke of Lancastre and Herfford, solicityng
and requiryng him with all diligent celeritie to conueigh himself
into England, promisyng him all their ayde, power, and assistence, if he
expellyng king Richard as a mā not mete nor cōuenient for so princely
an office and degree, would take vpon him the Scepter, rule, and Diademe
of his natiue coūtrey and first nutritiue soyle. And for that cause
they sent the reuerent father Thomas Arundel Archebishop of Cauntorbury
with certain lordes and citizens of diuers cities &amp; boroughes
in habite palliate &amp; dissimuled, into the citie of Paris, some goyng one
waye and some another, but all assemblyng together at the house of
Cluigny where the duke then soiourned.
            When he sawe the Archebishop his especial frende &amp; loked on other
his fautours &amp; louers, if he thāked God no man ought to merueil, if he
welcommed these Ambassadors none nede to wonder: but if he reioysed
and applauded not at their accesse and commyng, wise men may thinke
foly, &amp; fooles may laugh him to skorne. When he was of them saluted,
and they of him not onely resaluted but hertely welcommed &amp; frendely
entertained: The archebishop desiryng the duke to absent al other persons

refuge and comforte was to studye and deuise howe to haue a gouernour

they had wel cast their iyes and marked all the peres and nobles of the

realme of England) they could finde no duke nor marques, no erle nor

thei would be subiect and vassals so gladly as to yours: For this I assure
you (and you knowe it aswell as I) that wee miserable subiectes
haue so long borne the yoke of wāton vnwitty kyng Richard, and haue
paciently tollerat the parnicious persecucion of his gredy and auaricious
councellers, and haue wynked at the pollyng and extorcion of his
vnmeasurable officers, that our backes bee so galdde that wee can no

ended, the Duke paused awhile, and then put of his hood and sayd.

            When the duke had condiscended to the bisshoppes requeste, the bisshop
and his complices departed into Englande, makyng relacion to
their confederates of the dukes agremēt and pleasure, exhortyng euery
man to bee prest and ready at his arryuall.
            After their departure, the duke fayned to the Frenche kyng that he
would go into Brytein to visite his frend duke Ihon of Brytein: The
Frenche kyng thynking hym to meane inwardely as he outwardly dissimuled,
sent to the duke of Britayne letters of comendacion in fauour
of the duke of Lancaster. But if he had knowen that his entent was to
trans
                  •
               ret into Englande and depose his sonne in lawe Kyng Richarde,
he would suerely haue stopped him a tide, and let his purpose and passage.
What shoulde I saie? ye whiche shalbee, shalbe. The duke passed
into Britayne and there conducted and waged certeyn menne of warre
and shippes,The aryuyng and landyng of the Duke. and with good wynde &amp; better spede sailed into Englād
and landed at Rauēspurre in holdrenes as moste wryters affirme. But
some saie that he landed at Plymmoth, aud other at Portesmouth, but
where soeuer he arryued, sure it is that he tooke lande peaceably withe
out any againsaie or interrupcion. I will not be tedious to you in rehersyng
howe the erles of Northumbrelande and Westmerlande, the
lordes Percy, Rose, Willoughby and other resorted to him, and taking
an othe of hym that he should not dooe to kyng Richard any bodelye
harme, made to hym homage and becam his liege men: I omyte howe
children reioysed, how wemē clapped ther handes, &amp; howe men cried out
for ioye in euery toune and village where he passed, I relinquishe farther

the concourse of people, the number of horses, whiche occurred to
hym as he iourneyed toward London, reioysyng at his repaire and
commyng to the Citie. I wil not speake of the procession and singing
of the Cleargie, nor of the pleasant salutacions nor eloquent oracio
                  •
               s
made to hym by the Prelacie, nor of the presentes, welcomynges, laudes,
gratificacions made to him by the citiesens and comminaltee of
the citie of London, but I wil go to the purpose. Whē he was come to
London he consulted with his frendes diuers dayes, to whome came
Thomas Earle of Arundell sōne to Richard of Arundell, by king Richard
a litell afore put to deathe, whiche had lately escaped out of prison.
When the Duke had perceaued the fauour of the Nobilitie, the
affection of the Cleargie and the sincere loue of the comminalte towarde
hym and his procedynges, he marched foreward with a greate
company toward the West countrey, and in passyng by the waie, the
people assembled in great and houge multitudes (as the nature of the
common people is, euer desirous of newe changes) callyng him their
kyng, deprauyng and railyng on kyng Richard, as an innocent a dastarde,
a meicocke and not worthy to beare the name of a kyng. When
he had assembled together a conuenient nomber of people for his purpose
and was clerely determyned to depose kynge Rycharde from his
rule and dignitie, he proclaimed open warre agaynst hym and all his
partakers fautours and frendes. Kyng Richarde beyng in Irelande
was certified of the Dukes arriuall, from whence (when he had pacified
the sauage and wilde people) he retourned agayne into England,
entending to resiste and defend the eminent peril and apparant ieopardy,
and for the more tuiciō and safegard entred into the strong castel of
Flinte in North Wales .x. myles distaunt from Chester. When kyng
Richard perceued that the people by plumpes fled from him to Duke
Henry, he was amased and doubted what councell sodeinlie to take,
for on the one part he sawe his title iust, trewe, and vnfallible, and beside
that he had no small truste in the Welshemen, his conscience to
be cleane pure immaculate without spot or enuy: on the other side, he
sawe the puissaunce of his aduersaries, the sodaine departyng of them
that he mooste trusted, and all thynges turned vpsydoune, with these
thinges he beyng more abashed then encouraged, compelled by necessitie,
determined to kepe hym selfe in that castell till he myghte see the
worlde stable and in more suretie. For nowe he euidentely espied and
manifestly perceaued that he was lefte, lowted and forsaken of theym
by whom in tyme he myght haue bene ayded and relieued, and whiche
nowe was to late and to farre ouerpassed: and this thing is worthy to
be noted with a whitestone, of al princes rulers and men set in auctoritee
and rule, that this Duke Henry of Lancastre shoulde be thus called
to the kyngdome and haue the healpe and assistence all most of all
the whole realme, whiche perchaunce neuer thereof once thoughte or
yet dreamed: and that kyng Richard shuld thus be lefte desolate void
and desperate of all hope and comforte, in whom if there were any offence,

it ought more to be imputed to the frailtee of his wanton youth
then to the malice of his heart or cankerdnesse of his stomacke, but suche
is the frayle iudgement of mortall men whiche vilependyng and
not regardyng thynges presente before their eies, do euer thincke all
thynges that are to come to haue a prosperous successe and a delectable
sequcie. When the Duke of Lancastre knewe that king Richarde
was come to the castel of Flinte, whiche a man maye call the dolorous
Castell, because there king Richarde declined from his dignitie and
lost the tipe of his glorie and preheminence, he assembled together a
great armie in small space lest he myght geue his enemies time to preuent
his purpose and so to lose the good occasion of victory to him geuen,
came to the towne of Bristowe where he apprehended Willyam
lord Scrope the kinges treasurer sir Ihō Busshe and sir Henri Grene
knyghtes, and caused their heddes to be striken of, and from thence
toke his iourneie directly to Chester. When Thomas Percy Earle of
Worceter and great Master or lord Stuard of the kynges houshold
beyng brother to the Earle of Northumberland hard tell of the dukes
approch, bering displeasure to the king because he had proclaimed his
brother a traiter, brake before al the kinges houshold his white staffe,
which is the ensigne and token of his office and without delay went to
duke Henry. Whē the kinges familier seruitours perceiued this, they
dispersed them selfes some into one countrey and some into another.
            
               ❧ The Duke came toward the castell of Flinte wherof king Richard
beyng aduertised by councell of Ihon Pallet and Richarde Seimer
his assured s
                  •
               ruauntes departed out of the castell and toke the sandes
by the ryuer of Dee trusting to escape to Chester and there to haue refuge
and succoure, but or he had farre passed he was forelayed and
taken and brought to the Duke, which sent hym secretly to the Towre
of London. When the Duke had thus possessed his longe desyred
praye, he came to London in solempne estate and there called a Parliament
in the kynges name, to the whiche many of the kynges frendes,
but more of his there appeared. There was declared howe vnprofitable
kyng Richarde had bene to the realme duryng his reigne, howe
he subuerted the lawes, polled the people and ministred Iustice to no
man but to suche as pleased hym. And to the entent that the commons
should bee perswaded that he was an vniust and vnprofitable Prince
and a tiraunte ouer his subiectes, and worthy to bee deposed. There
were set forthe .xxxv. solempne articles very heynous to the eares of
men, and to some almost vncredible: The very effecte of whiche articles
I will truely reporte hereafter accordyng to my copie.
            
                ¶Fyrst that kyng Richard wastfully spent the treasure of the realme
and had geuen the possessions of the Croune to men vnworthy, by reason
wherof daily newe charges more and more were layd in the neckes
of the poore comminaltie. And where diuerse lordes as well spiritual
as temporall, were appointed by the highe court of Parliament to cō
               mon
and treate of diuers matters concernyng the common wealth of

the same, which beyng busie about the same commission, he with other 
of his affinitie went about to empeach of treson, and by force and menace
compelled the Iustices of the realme at Shrewsburie to condiscend
to his opinion, for the destruction of the said Lordes: in so muche
that he began to reise war against Ihon duke of Lancastre, Thomas 
Erle of Arundell, Richarde Erle of Warwicke, and other lordes contrary
to his honour and promyse.
            ¶Item that he caused his vncle the Duke of Glocester to be arrested 
without lawe, and sent him to Caleis, and there without iudgemente
murdered hym. And although the Erle of Arundell vpon his arainement
pleaded his charter of pardon, he could not be heard, but was in
most vile and shamefull maner sodainly put to death.
            ¶Item he assembled certain Lancashire and Cheshire men to the entent 
to make warre on the foresaid Lordes, and suffered them to robbe
and pill without correction or reprefe.
            ¶Item although the king flateringly and with great dissimulacion 
made proclamacion throughout the realme, that the lordes before named
were not attached for any crime of treason, but onely for extorcions
and oppressions done in this realme, yet he laied to theym in the
parliament, rebellion and manifest treason.
            ¶Item he hath compelled diuers of the saied lordes seruauntes and 
frendes by menace &amp; extreme paimentes, to make great fines to theyr
vtter vndoyng. And notwithstandyng his pardon to theim graunted
yet he made them fine of newe.
            ¶Item where diuers were appointed to common of the estate of the 
realme, and the common welthe of the same. The same King caused al
the rolles and recordes to be kept from them, contrary to his promise
made in the parliament, to his open dishonour.
            ¶Item he vncharitably cōmaunded that no man vpon paine of losse 
of life and goodes should once entreate him for the retourne of Henry
nowe duke of Lancastre.
            ¶Item where this realme is holden of God, and not of the Pope or 
other prince, the said kyng Richard after he had obteined diuers actes
of parliament for his owne peculier profite and pleasure, then he obteined
Bulles and extreme censures from Rome, to compell al menne
straightely to kepe the same, contrary to the honour and auncient priuileges
of this realme.
            ¶Item although the duke of Lancastre had done his deuoir against 
Thomas duke of Norffolke in profe of his quarel, yet the saied Kyng
without reason or ground banished him the realme for ten yeres contrary
to all equitee.
            ¶Item before the dukes departure, he vnder his brode seale licenced
him to make attourneis to prosecute and defend his causes: The saied
kyng after his departure wold suffre none attourney to apere for him
but did with his at his pleasure.
            ¶Item the same kyng put oute diuers shriues lawefully elected and 
               
put in their romes, diuers other of his owne minions subuertyng the
lawe contrary to his othe and honour.
            
                ¶Item he borowed great sōmes of money, and bound him vnder his
letters pattentes for the repaimēt of thesame, &amp; yet not one peny paid.
            
                ¶Itē he taxed men at the wil of him &amp; his vnhappy councel, &amp; thesame
treasure spent in folie, not paiyng pore men for their vitail &amp; viande.
            
                ¶Item he said that the lawes of the realme were in his head, and somtime
in his brest, by reason of whiche fantasticall opinion, he destroied
noble men and empouerished the pore commons.
            
                ¶Item the parliament settyng and enacting diuers notable statutes
for the profite and aduauncement of the common welth, he by his priuie
frendes and soliciters caused to be enacted that no acte then enacted
shuld be more preiudiciall to him then it was to any of his predecessors,
through whiche Prouiso he did often as he liste and not as the
lawe ment.
            
                ¶Itē for to serue his purpose he wold suffer the Shrefes of the shire
to remaine aboue one yere or two.
            
                ¶Item at the sommons of the parliament when knightes and burgesses
should be electe that the election had bene full proceded, he put
out diuers persones elected, and put in other in their places to serue
his wyll and appetite.
            
                ¶Item he had priuie espialles in euery shire, to here who had of him
any communicacion, and if he commoned of his lasciuious liuyng or
outragious doyng, he streighte waies was apprehended and made a
greuous fine.
            
                ¶Item the spiritualtie alledged against hym that he at his goyng
into Ireland exacted many notable sōmes of money, beside plate &amp; iuels,
without law or custome, contrary to his oth takē at his coronaciō.
            
                ¶Item when diuers lordes and Iustices were sworne to say the truthe
of diuers thinges to them committed in charge both for the honor
of the realme and profite of the kyng, the said kyng so menaced theym
with sore thretenynges, that no man wold or durste saie the ryght.
            
                ¶Item that with out the assent of the nobilitee, he caried the iewels
and plate and treasure ouer the see into Irelande, to the great empouerishyng
of the realme. And al the good recordes for the cōmon welthe
and against his extorcions, he caused priuely to be embesiled and
conueied away.
            
                ¶Item in all leages and letters to bee concluded or sent to the see of
Rome or other regions: His writyng was so subtill and so darke, that
no other prince durst once beleue him, nor yet his owne subiectes.
            
                ¶Item he mooste tirannously and vnprincely said that the liues and
goodes of al his subiectes were in the princes hāds &amp; at his disposiciō
            
            
                ¶Item that he contrary to the great Charter of England caused dyuers
lustie men to appele diuers olde men, vpon matters determinable
at the common law, in the court marcial, because that in that court
is no triall but onely by battaile: Whervpon the said aged personnes

fearyng the sequele of the matter submitted theym selfes to his mercy
whom he fined and raunsomed vnreasonably at his pleasure.
            ¶Item he craftely deuised certain priuie othes contrary to the lawe,
&amp; caused diuers of his subiectes first to be sworne to obserue the same
and after bounde them in bondes for former keping of the same, to the
great vndoyng of many honest men.
            ¶Item where the Chauncellour accordyng to the lawe woulde in no 
wise graunt a prohibicion to a certain person: the king graunted in vnto
the same person vnder his priuie seale with greate thretnynges if it
shuld be disobeied.
            ¶Item he banyshed the bishop of Canterbury without cause or iudgement 
and kept him in the parliament chamber with men of Armes.
            ¶Item the bishops goodes he graunted to his successour vpon condicion 
that he shuld mainteine al his statutes made at Shrewsburie,
Anno .xxi. and the statutes made. Anno .xxii. at Couentree.
            ¶Item vpon the accusacion of the Archbishop, the king craftely perswaded 
the saied byshop to make no answere, for he would be his warrant,
and aduised him not to come to the parliament. And so withoute
answere he was condemned and exiled, and his goodes seazed.
            These bee the articles of any effecte whiche were laied against him,
sauyng fowre concernyng the bishoppe of Caunterbury, whiche onely
touched hī, but his workyng vnwrought king Richard frō his croūe.
            
               AND for as much as these articles, and other hemous and detestable
accusacions were laied against him in the open parliament, it was
thought by the most parte that kyng Richard was worthy to be deposed
of al honor, rule and Pryncely gouernance. And instrumentes autentike
and solempne to depose, and other instrumentes were made to
certain persons for them, and all homagers of the realme to resigne to
hym all the homages and fealties dewe to him as kyng &amp; soueraigne.
            But or this deposicion was executed in tyme, he came to Westminster
and called a great councell of all the nobilitie and commons
to the entente to conclude and make expedicion of all thynges whiche
before were purposed and set forward.
            
               ❧ In the meane season diuerse of king Richardes seruauntes which
by licence had accesse to his person, comforted, animated and encouraged
him beyng for sorowe withered, broken and in maner halfe deade,
aduertisyng and exhortyng him to regard his welthe and to saue his
lyfe. And firste they aduised him willyngly to suffer him self to be deposed
bothe of his dignitie, &amp; depriued of his riches: so that the duke
of Lancastre might without murdre or battail obteine the scepter and
Diademe, after the whiche they well perceiued he gaped and thrusted
by the mene wherof they thought be shuld be in per
                  •••
                assurance of his
life long to continue, &amp; therfore might commit him selfe to good hope,
which is the best felowe &amp; companiō that a man in aduersitie can associat
or ioyne him self withal. Surely this councel was both good and
honeste in so great an extremitie, but yet the full effect folowed not as

the sequele of the thyng sheweth and apparantely declareth. What
profite, what honoure, what suretie bad it bene to kyng Richarde, if he
when he myght, whiche professed the name and title of a kyng, whiche
is as much to saie, the ruler or keper of people, had excogitate or remē
               bred
to haue bene a keper of 
                  •
               is owne hedde and lyfe, whiche nowe beyng
forsaken, reiect and abandoned of al such as he, being an euil sheperd
or herdeman, before time dyd not plie, kepe and diligently ouerse
was easily reduced and brought into the hādes of his enemies. Nowe
it was no mastery to perswade a man beyng desperate pensife and ful
of dolour, to abdicate him selfe from his empire and imperiall preheminence:
so that in onlie hope of his life and sauegard, he agreed to al
thynges that of hym were demanded, and desired his kepers to shewe
and declare to the duke, that if he wold vouchsafe to accord and come
to him, he wolde declare secretely thynges to hym both profitable and
pleasant. His kepers sent word of all his saiynges to the duke, whiche
incontinent repaired to his chamber. There kyng Richard cōmoned
with him of many thinges, and amongest all other affirmed those accusacions
to be to muche trewe whiche the comminaltie of the realme
alledged against him: that is to say, that he had euel gouerned his dominion
and kingdome, and therfore he desyred to be disburdoned of so
great a charge and so heauy a burdein, besechyng the Duke to grant
to him the safegarde of his lyfe, and to haue compassion of hym, nowe
as he before that time had bene to him bountifull and magnificent.
            
               ❧ The duke biddyng him to be of good comfort and out of fear warranted
him his lyfe, so that he wold resigne to him his scepter croune
&amp; dignitie: also nether to procure nor consent to any thyng or act whiche
myght be hurtfull or preiudiciall to his person or succession, to the
whiche demaundes he graunted and frely condiscended and agreed.
            
               THE Duke of Lancastre the nexte daie declared all kyng Richardes
hole mind to the coūcel, but especially to his vncle Edmunde duke
of Yorke (whose helpe he much vsed) whiche hearyng al thynges to be
in a broyle, a few daies before was come to London. The nobles and
commons were well pleased that kyng Richard shoulde frankely and
frely of his owne mere mocion, whiche they muche desired (lest it shuld
be noysed and reported that he thervnto were inforced and by violence
constrained) resigne his croune and depart from his regalitee.
            Not long after he caused a great assemble to be apointed at the Towre
of London, where kyng Richard appareled in vesture and robe royall
the diademe on his head, &amp; the scepter in his hand, came personally before
the cōgregacion and said these wordes in effecte. I Richard king
of England Duke of Fraunce, Aquitaine, and Lorde of Ireland, confesse
and say before you my lordes and other our subiectes, that by the
hole space of .xxii. yere in the whiche I haue obteined and possessed the
rule and regiment of this famous realme of England, partely ruled
and 
                  〈◊〉
                by the euell &amp; sinister councell of peruerse &amp; flatteryng
persons: and partely led by the frailtie of young waueryng and wanton

youth, and with delectacion of worldly and volupteous appetite,
haue omitted and not executed my royall office and bounden dutie accordyng
as I oughte to haue dooen, in ministeryng iustice and prefermente
of the comon wealthe, whiche negligence I more then any of
you as I thynke my selfe, doo sore repente and bewayle, and specially
because I am brought to this poyncte, that I knowledge and confesse
my self, not worthy longer to reigne nor to haue any farther rule. So
that now I can nother amende my misdedees, nor correcte my offences
whiche suerly I entended to dooe, and especially in my olde age, in the
whiche euill thynges be accustomed to be amended, and the fautes and
offences of youth, to be corrected and reformed. For what young man
comonly can befounde indued with so muche vertue and so good qualities,
whiche agitate &amp; pricked with the heate of youth, shall not turne
and decline from the right pathe and direct waie, and yet when he cometh
to the more ripenes of yeres and greate grauitie, doth not amend
and change into be
                  •
               ter his olde errates and wanton actes, for experience
teacheth, that of a rugged colte, commeth a good horse, and of a
shreude boye, proueth a good man. But sithe Fortune doth not permit
and suffre me so to do, to thentent that the publike welth of this realme
maie bee holpen and auansed by my meane, and after this not like again
to declyne and decaye. And to the intent that it shall bee lefull to
you, to elect and chose my cosyn germayne, Henry duke of Lancastre,
a man mete for a realme, and a prince apt for a kyngdom, to your kyng
and souereigne lorde. I of my owne mere mocion and frewill, do putte
and depose my self out of all royall dignite, preheminence and sofferaignitee,
and resigne the possession, title and vse of this realme, with all
rightes there vnto apperteigyng, into his handes and possession. And
then with a lamentable voyce and a sorowfull countenance, deliuered
his scepter and croune to the duke of Lancastre, requiryng euery
persone seuerally by their names, to graunt and assente that he might
liue a priuate and a solitarie life, with the swetnesse whereof, he would
be so well pleased, that it should be a pain and punishement to hym to
go abrode, and deliuered all the goodes that he had, to the some of
three hundred thousande pounde in coyne, beside plate and
iuels, as a pledge and satisfaccion, for the iniuries and
wronges by hym committed and dooen. But
what soeuer was promised, he was disceiued
For shortly after his resignacion he was
conueighed to the castell of Ledes in
Kent, &amp; from thence to Poumffret
wher he departed out of this
miserable life, as you
shall heare herafter.

                  HEN the fame was dispersed abrode
that Kyng Rycharde had putte hym
selfe from his dignitee royall,The .i. yere. and
resigned his scepter and diademe imperiall,
Henry Plantagenet borne at
Bolyngbroke in the Countie of Lyncolne,
duke of Lancastre and Herfford
erle of Derby, Lecester and Lyncolne
sonne to Ihon of Gaunt duke of Lancastre,
with one voyce bothe of the nobles
and comons, was published, proclaymed
&amp; declared kyng of England
and of Fraunce, and lorde of Irelāde,
and on the daie of saincte Edward the confessor, was at Westminster
with great solemnitee and royal pompe, sacred, enoynted and crouned
king by the name of kyng Henry the fourth. But who so euer reioysed
at this coronacion, or whosoeuer delighted at his high promociō, suer
it is that Edmond Mortimer erle of Marche whiche was heire to Lionell
duke of Clarence, the thirde begotten sonne of kyng Edwarde the
third as you before haue heard, and Richard erle of Cābrige the sonne
to Edmond duke of Yorke, whiche had maried Anne sister to thesame
Edmonde, wer with these doynges nether pleased nor contente. In so
muche that now the deuisiō once beyng begon, the one linage persecuted
the other, and neuer ceased till the heires males of bothe the lines
wer by battaill murdered or by sedicion clerely extinct and destroyed.
               At the daie of the coronacion, to thentent that he should not seme to
take vpon hym the croune and scepter royall without title or lawfull
clayme but by extorte power and iniurious intrusion, he was aduised
to make his title as heire to Edmonde, surnamed or vntruly fayned
Crouchebacke, sonne to kyng Henry the third, and to saie that the said
Edmond was elder brother to kyng Edward the first, and for his deformitee
repudiat and put by from the croune royall to whom by his mother
Blanche doughter and sole heire to Henry duke of Lancastre, he
was next of bloud and vndoubtfull heire. But because not onely his
frēdes but also his priuy enemies knewe, that was but a title and that
this title was by inuentors of mischief fayned, imagened &amp; published
and wer surely enformed not only that thesaid Edmond was younger
sonne to kyng Henry the third accordyng as it is declared in the act of
Parliament before recited. Also hauyng true knowledge that Edmōd
was nether Crokebacked nor a deformed persone, but a goodly gentil
man and a valiante capitain, and somuche fauored of his louyng father,
that he to preferre hym to the mariage of the Quene dowager of

Nauerne hauyng a greate liuelode, gaue to hym the countie palātyne
of Lancastre with many notable honours, high seigniories and large
priuileges. Therefore thei aduised hym to make some other clayme to
the newe obteined regiment, and so caused it to be proclaimed and published
that he chalenged the realme not onely by conquest, but also be
cause he was by kyng Richard adopted as heire, &amp; declared successor &amp;
of hym by resignacion had accepted the croune and scepter, &amp; also that
he was the next heire male of the bloud royall to kyng Richard.
               After that he was crouned, he created his eldest sonne lorde Henry,
Prince of Wales, duke of Cornwale, and erle of Chester, then beeyng
of the age of .xij. yeres. This sol
                     ••
                  ite finished, he called his high court
of parliament, in the whiche it was demaunded by the kynges frendes
what should be doen with kyng Richard. The bishop of Carleile whiche
was a man both wel lerned &amp; well stomacked rose vp and said. My
lordes I require you take hede what answere you make to this question.
For I thynke there is none of you worthy or mete to geue iudgemente
on so noble a Prince as kyng Richard is, whom we haue taken
for our souereigne and liege lorde by the space of .xxij. yeres, and I assure
you, there is not so ranke a traytor, nor so arrante a thiefe, nor so
cruell a murderer, whiche is apprehended and deteigned in prisone for
his offence, but he shall bee brought before the iustice to heare his iudgemente,
and yet you will proceade to the iudgemente of an anoynted
kyng, and here nother his answere nor excuse. And I saie that the duke
of Lancastre whom you call kyng, hath more offended &amp; more trespassed
to kyng Richard and this realme, then the kyng hath other doen to
hym or to vs. For it is manifesty knowen that the duke was banished
the realme by kyng Richard and his counsaill, and by the iudgemente
of his owne father, for the space of tenne yeres, for what cause all
you knowe, and yet without license of Kyng Richarde he is returned
again into the realme, ye and that is worse, hath taken vpon hym the
name, title and prehemiēnce of a kyng. And therfore I say and affirme
that you do apparantly wrong, and manifest iniury to procede in any
thing against kyng Richard, without callyng him opēly to his answer
and defence. When the bishop had ended, he was incontinent by therle
Marshall attached &amp; committed to ward in the Abbey of. S. Albones.
               
                  ❧ And then it was concluded, that kyng Richard should continew in
a large prisone, and should bee plentifully serued of all thynges necessarie
bothe for viande and apparell, and that if any persones would
presume to rere warre or congregate a multitude to releue or deliuer
hym out of prisone, that then he should bee the first that should dye for
that sedicious commocion. In this Parliamente the Lorde Fitzwater
appeled the duke of Aumarle of high treason, and offered to fight with
hym in listes royall. Likewise the lorde Morley appeled therle of Salisbury,
and there were more then .xx. appellantes whiche waged battaill
in this parliamente. But the kyng pardoned all their offences sauyng

the fautes of the lorde Morley and therle of Salisbury, whom
he comitted to ward, and after at the request of their frēdes, their offences
wer remitted &amp; thei deliuered. He punished also extremely all suche
as were priuie and dooers of the homecide of Thomas his vncle late
duke of Glocester, whiche was shamefully murdered before in y• toune
of Caleis. Besides this, he auansed his frendes, and called out of exile
Richard erle of Warwike, and restored the erle of Arundelles sonne to
his owne possession and dignite, and many other. He toke into his speciall
fauor Ihon Hollande duke of Exceter and erle of Huntyngdone
halfe brother to king Richard, whiche had espoused the lady Elizabeth
his owne sister. And beeyng before capitain of Caleis, greatly moued
and inwardly greued that Kyng Richarde his brother was amoued
out of the seate royall, began to reyse and stirre vp newe mocions and
fedicious faccions within the realme. Wherfore to aduoyde suche pestiterus
dangers, the newe kyng recōciled hym to his fauor, and made
hym as he surely coniectured his perfite frende, where in deede he was
inwardly his dedly enemie. In this parliament wer adnichilate al the
actes pa
                     •
                  ed in the parliament holden by kyng Richard in the .xxj. yere
of his reigne, whiche was called the euill parliament for the nobilitee,
the worse for the menaltie, but worste of all for the cōmonaltee. For in
that parliament, will ruled for reason, men aliue wer condemned without
examinacion, men dedde and put to execuciō by priuy murder wer
adiudged openly to die, the hie prelate of the realme without answere
was banished: An erle arraigned could not be suffered to plede his pardon,
and consequently one counsailer did al thyng, and all counsailers
did nothyng, affirmyng the saiyng of Esope, whiche hearyng his feloe
to saie that he could do all thynges, saied he could do nothyng. When
he had thus reconciled his nobilite, and gat the fauor of the spiritualte
and wonderfully pleased the comonaltee, but not so muche pleasyng
them, as the possessyng of the croune pleased hymself and his frendes,
he of them and by the fauor of them bothe, for the auoydance of al claimes,
titles and ambiguitees to be made vnto the croune and diademe
of the realme had his dignitee ligne and succession enacted, confirmed
and entayled by the assent of the high courte of Parliamente as foloweth
worde by worde.
               
                  At the request and peticion aswell of the nobilitie as of the comons
in this parliamente assembled, it is ordaigned and established that the
enheritance of the crounes and realmes of Englande and of Fraunce,
and of all other lordshippes to the kyng our souereigne lorde, aswel on
this side the seas as beyond apperteignyng with their appurtenāces,
shall bee vnited and remain in the persone of our souereigne lorde the
kyng, and in the heires of his body lawfully begotten. And especially
at the request and assent aforsaid, it is ordeigned, established, pronounced,
enacted, writen and declared, that my lorde Prince, Henry eldest
sonne to our soueraigne lorde the kyng, shall bee heire apparante and

successor to our saied souereigne lorde in thesaid croune, realmes &amp; seigniories,
to haue &amp; enioy them with al their appurtenaunces after the
discease of our saied soueraigne to hym and the heires of his body begotten.
And if he die without heires of his body begottē, that then the
saied crounes, realmes and seigniories with their appurtenances shal
remain to the lorde Thomas, secōd sonne to our said soueraigne lorde
and to the heires of his body begotten, and if he departe without issue
of his body begotten, all the premisses to remaigne to lorde Ihon his
third sonne and to the heires of his body begotten. And if he dye without
issue, then the crounes, realmes, &amp; seigniories aforsaied with their
appurtenances shal remain to the lorde Humfrey the .iiij. sonne to our
said souereigne lorde, and to the heires of his body lawfully begotten.
               
               After whiche acte passed, he thought neuer to bee by any of his subiectes
molested or troubled. But O Lorde, what is the mutabilitee of
fortune? O God what is the chaunge of worldely safetie? O Christe
what stablenes consisteth in mannes prouision? Or what ferme suerty
hath a prince in his throne and degree? Considryng this kyng hauyng
the possession of the croune and realme, and that in open parliament, agreed
to by the princes, condiscended to by the Clerkes, ratified by the
commons, and enacted by the three estates of the realme, was when he
thought hymself surely mortised in a ferme rocke &amp; immouable foundacion,
sodainly with a trimbelyng quickesande &amp; vnstedfast grounde
like to haue sonkē or been ouerthrowen. For diuerse lordes whiche wer
kyng Richardes frendes, outwardly dissimuled that whiche thei inwardly
conspired and determined, to confounde this kyng Henry to
whom thei had bothe sworne allegance and doen homage, and to erect
again and set vp their old lorde and frend kyng Richard the second.
               In this case there lacked only an orgaine and conueighance bothe
how secretly to serche and knowe the myndes of the nobilitee, as all
so to bryng them to an assemble and counsail, where thei might consult
and comen together, how to bryng to efficacite and effect, their long desired
purpose and secrete enterprise. Se how the deuill is as ready to
set furth mischief, as the good angell is to auance vertue. At this time
was an Abbot in Westminster, a man of aparant vertues, professyng
openly Christ, christian Charitee, and due subieccion and obeisance to
his prince: whiche Abbot hearyng kyng Henry once saie when he was
but erle of Darby and of no mature age or growen grauitee, that princes
had to litle, and religeons had to muche, imagined in hymself that
he now obteinyng the croune of the realme, if he wer therin a long continuer,
would remoue the greate beame that then greued his iyes and
pricked his conscience. For you muste vnderstande that these monasticall
persones, lerned and vnliterate, better fed then taught, toke on thē
to write &amp; regester in the boke of fame, the noble actes, the wise dooynges,
and politike gouernances of kynges and princes, in whiche cronographie,
if a kyng gaue to them possessions or graunted them liberties

or exalted them to honor &amp; worldly dignitee, he was called a sainct
he was praised without any deserte aboue the Moone, his geanelogie
was written, and not one iote that might exalt his fame, was ether for
gotten or omitted. But if a christian prince had touched their liberties
or claimed any part iustly of their possessions, or would haue intermitted
in their holy francheses, or desired aide of thē against his and their
comon enemies. Then tonges talked and pennes wrote, that he was a
tirant, a depresser of holy religion, an enemie to Christes Churche and
his holy flocke, and a damned and accursed persone with Dathan and
Abiron to the depe pitte of helle. Wherof the prouerbe begā, geue and
be blessed, take awaie and bee accursed. Thus the feare of lesyng their
possessions, made them pay yerely annates to the Romish bishop: thus
the feare of correccion and honest restraint of libertee, made them from
their ordinaries, yea almoste from obedience of their princes to sue dispensacions,
exempcions and Immunitees.
               
                  THIS Abbot that I spake of whiche could not well forgette the saiyng
of kyng Henry, and beyng before in greate fauor and high estimacion
with kyng Richard called to his hous on a daie in the terme season
al suche lordes &amp; other persones whiche he ether knewe or thought
to be as affeccionate to kyng Richarde, and enuious to the estate and
auancement of kyng Henry, whose names wer, Ihon Hollande duke of
Exceter and erle of Huntyngdon, Thomas Hollande duke of Surrey
and erle of Kent, Edward duke of Aumarle and erle of Rutland sonne
to the duke of Yorke, Ihō Montagew erle of Salisbury, Hugh Spē
                  ser
erle of Glocester, Ihon the bishop of Carleill, sir Thomas Blount
and Magdalen one of kyng Richardes chapell, a man as like to hym
in stature and proporcion in all liniamentes of his body, as vnlike in
birthe dignitee or condicions. This Abbot highly fested these greate
lordes and his speciall frendes, and when thei had well dined, thei all
withdrew themselfes into a secrete chamber and sat doune to counsail,
when thei wer set, Ihon Hollande duke of Exceter whose rage of reuen
gyng ye iniury doen to kyng Richard was nothyng mitigate nor mollified,
but rather encreased and blossomed, declared to theim their allegeance
promised, and by othe confirmed to kyng Richard his brother,
forgettyng not the high promocions and notable dignities whiche he
and all other there present had obteigned by the high fauor and munificent
liberalitee of his saied brother, by the whiche thei wer not onely
by othe and allegeance bounde, and also by kindnes and vrbanitee insensed
&amp; moued to take part with hym and his frendes, but also bound
to be reuenged for hym and his cause, on his mortall enemies and dedly
foes, in whiche doyng he thought policie more meter to be vsed then
force, and some wittie practise rather to bee experimented then manifest
hostilitee or open warre. And for the expedicion of this enterprise
he deuised a solempne iustes to be enterprised betwene hym and .xx. on
his parte, and the erle of Salisbury and .xx. on his part at Oxforde: to

the whiche triumphe, Kyng Henry should bee inuited and desired,
and when he were moste busely regardyng the marciall playe and
warly disporte, he sodainly should bee slain and destroyed. And by this
meanes kyng Richard whiche was yet a liue, should be restored to his
libertie and repossessed of his croune and kyngdome, and appoincted
farther who should assemble the people, the numbre and persones, whiche
should accomplishe and performe this inuented assaie and policie.
               
                  THIS deuise so much pleased the sedicious congregacion, that thei
not onely made an indenture sextipartite sealed with their seales and
signed with their handes in the whiche eche bounde hym selfe to other
to endeuoure theim selfes bothe for the destruction of Kyng Henry
and the creacion of king Richard, but also sware on the holy Euangelistes
the one to be trewe and secrete to the other, euen to the houre and
point of death. When all thynges were thus apointed and concluded
the Duke of Exceter came to the kyng to Windsore, requiryng hym
for the loue that he bare to the noble actes of chiualrie, that he woulde
vouchesafe not onely to repaire to Oxford to see and behold their man
lie feates, and warlike pastime: but also to be the discouerer and indifferente
iudge (if any ambiguitee should arise) of their couragions actes
and royall triumphe. The kyng seeyng hymself so effectuously desired,
and that of his brother in lawe, and nothing lesse imagenyng thē
that whiche was pretended, gentelly graunted and frendly condiscended
to his request. Whiche thyng obteined, all the lordes of this cōspiracie
departed to their houses (as theinoised) to set armorers on worke
for trimmyng of their harneis against the solemne iustes. Some had
the helme the visere the two bauiers &amp; the two plackardes of the same
curiously grauē and conningly costed: Some had their collers fretted
and other had them set with gilte bullions, one company had the plackard,
the rest, the port the burley, the tasses, the lamboys, the backpece
the tapull, and the border of the curace all gylte: And another bande
had them all enameled Azure. One sorte had the vambrases the pacegardes
the grandgardes the poldren, the pollettes, parted with golde
and azure: And another flocke had theym siluer and sable: Some had
the mainferres, the close gantlettes, the guissettes the flancardes droped
&amp; gutted with red, and other had thē spekeled with grene: one sorte
had the quishes, the greues, the surlettes, y• sockettes on the right side
and on the left side siluer. Some had the spere, the burre, the cronet al
yelowe, and other had them of diuers colours. One band had the scafferon
the cranet, the bard of the horse all white, and other had them all
gilte. Some had their armyng sweardes freshly burnyshed and some
had thē conningly vernished. Some spurres were white, some gilt, and
some cole blacke. One parte had their Plumes all white, another had
them all redde, and the third had them of seuerall colours. One ware
on his headpece his Ladies sleue, and another bare on his helme the
gloue of his dearlyng: But to declare the costly Bases, the riche bardes

the pleasant trappers bothe of goldesmithes worke and embrawdery,
no lesse sumptuously then curiously wrought, it wold aske a long
time to declare, for euerye man after his appetite deuised his fantasy
verifiyng the olde Prouerbe, so many heades, so many wittes.
               The duke of Exceter came to his house &amp; raised men on euery side
and prepared horse and harneis, mete and apte for his compassed purpose.
When the Duches his wife which was sister to kyng Henry perceiued
this, she no lesse trouble coniectured to be prepared against her
brother thē was in dede eminent &amp; at hand, wherfore she wept &amp; made
great lamentacion. When the duke perceued her dolour, he said, what
Besse, how chaunseth this, when my brother king Richard was deposed
of his dignitie, and committed to harde and sharpe prison whiche
had bene kyng and ruled this realme noblie by the space of .xxii. yeres
and your brother was exalted to the throne and dignitie imperiall of
the same, then my hearte was heauie, my life stoode in ieopardie and
my combe was clerely cut, but you then reioysed laughed and triumphed,
wherfore I pray you be contente that I may aswell reioyce and
haue pleasure at the deliueryng and restoryng of my brother iustly to
his dignite, as you were iocond and pleasaunt when your brother vniustly
and vntrulie depriued and disseazed my brother of the same. For
of this I am sure, that yf my brother prospere, you and I shal not fall
nor decline: but if your brother continue in his estate and magnificēce
I doubte not your decay nor ruine, but I suspecte the losse of my life,
beside the forfeyture of my landes and goodes. When he had sayd, he
kissed his Lady whiche was sorowful and pensife, and he departed toward
Oxforde with a great company bothe of Archers and horsemen,
and when he came there, he founde ready al his mates and confederates
wel apointed for their purpose, excepte the Duke of Aumerle Erle
of Rutland, for whom thei sent messengers in great haste. This duke
of Aumerle went before from Westminster to se his father the duke of
Yorke, and sittyng at diner had his counterpaine of the endenture of
the confederacie wherof I spake before in his bosome.
               The father espied it and demaunded what it was, his sonne lowely
and beningly answered that it myght not bee sene, and that it touched
not him. By saint George quod the father I will see it, and so by force
toke it out of his bosome, when he perceaued the contente and the sixe
signes and seales sette and fixed to the same, whereof the seale of his
sonne was one, he sodainlie rose from the table, cōmaundyng his horses
to be sadeled, and in a greate furie saied to his sonne, thou trayter
these, thou hast bene a traitour to kyng Richard, and wilt thou nowe
be falce to thy cosen kyng Henry? thou knowest wel inough that I am
thy pledge borowe and mayneperner, body for body, and land for goodes
in open parliament, and goest thou about to sekemy death and destruction?
by the holy rode I had leauer see the strangeled on a gibbet.
And so the duke of Yorke moūted on horsbacke to ride toward Windsor

to the kyng and to declare the hole effecte of his sōne and his adherentes
&amp; partakers. The duke of Aumerle seyng in what case he stode
toke his horse and rode another way to Windsor, riding in post thither
(whiche his father being an olde man could not do.) And when he was
alighted at the castel gate, he caused the gates to be shutte, saiyng that
he must nedes deliuer the keies to the kyng. When he came before the
kynges presence he kneled downe on his knees, besechyng him of mercy
and forgeuenes: The kyng demanded the cause: then he declared to
him plainely the hole confederacie and entier coniuracion in manner
and forme as you haue harde: Well saied the kyng, if this be trewe we
pardon you, if it bee fained at your extreme perill bee it. While the
kyng and the duke talked together, the duke of Yorke knocked at the
castel gate, whom the kyng caused to be let in, and there he delyuered
the endenture whiche before was taken from his sonne, into the kynges
handes. Which writyng when he had redde, and sene, perceiuyng
the signes and seales of the confederates, he chaunged his former purpose.
For the daie before he heryng say that the chalengers were al ready
and that the defenders were come to do their deuoir, purposed to
haue departed toward the triumphe the nexte day, but by his prudent
and forecastyng councel, somwhat staied till he myght se the ayre clere
and no darcke cloude nere to the place where the listes were. And nowe
beyng aduertised of the truthe and veritie, howe his destruction and
deathe was compassed, was not a lictell vexed, but with a great and
meruclous agonie perturbed and vnquieted, and therfore determined
there to make his abode not hauyng time to loke and gase on Iustes
and tourneis, but to take hede howe to kepe and conserue his lyfe and
dignitie, and in that place taried tyll he knewe what way his enemies
wold set forward. And shortly wrote to the Earle of Northumberland
his high Cōstable, and to the erle of Westmerland his high Marshal,
and to other his assured frendes of al the douteful daunger and perelous
ieopardie. The coniuratoures perceiuyng by the lacke of the
duke of Aumerles cōming, and also seyng no preparacion made there
for the kynges commyng, imagined with them selfes that their enterpryse
was intimate and published to the kyng: Wherfore that thyng
whiche they attempted priuilie to do, nowe openly with speare &amp; shilde
they determined with all diligent celeritie to set forthe and aduaunce.
And so they adorned Magdaleue, a man resemblyng muche kyng Richard
in roiall and princely vesture, callyng him kyng Richard, affirming
that he by fauour of his kepers was deliuered out of prison and
set at libertie, and they folowed in a quadrat array to the entent to destroy
king Henry as the most pernicious &amp; venemus enemy to thē and
his owne naturall countrey. While the confederates with this newe
publyshed Idole accompanied with a puissant armie of men, toke the
directe way and passage toward Windsor: King Henry beyng admonished
of their approchyng, with a fewe horse in the night, came to the

Tower of London about .xii. of the clocke, where he in the mornynge
caused the Maire of the citie to apparell in armure the beste and moste
couragious persons of the citie: which brought to him .iii.M. archers
and .iii.M. bill men, beside them that were deputed to defend the citie,
               The Lordes of the confederacie entered the castel of Windsor, where
they findyng not their praie, determined with all spede to passe forthe
to London: But in the waie, changyng their purpose they returned to
the towne of Colbroke and there taried. These Lordes had much people
folowyng them, what for feare and what for entreatie surely beleuyng
that kyng Richard was there present and in company. King Hē
                  ry
issued out of London with twentye M. men and came to Hounsloe
Heath, where he pitched his campe, abidyng the commyng of his enemies:
but when they were aduertised of the kynges puissaunce, or els
amased with feare, or forthinkyng and repentyng their begonne busines,
or mistrustyng their owne company and felowes, departed from
thence to Barkamstede and so to Aucester, and there the Lordes toke
their lodgyng: The duke of Surrey erle of Kent and the erle of Salisbury
in one ynne, and the duke of Exceter and the erle of Glocester
in another, and al the hoste laie in the feldes. The Baily of the towne
with fowre score archers set on the house wher the duke of Surrey and
other laie: the house was mannely assaulted and strongely defended a
great space: The Duke of Exceter beyng in another inne with the erle
of Glocester set fier on diuers howses in the towne, thinkyng that the
assailantes wold leue the assault and rescue their goodes, which thing
they nothyng regarded. The host liyng without hearyng noiseand seyng
fire in the towne, beleuyng that the kyng was come thyther with
his puissaunce, fledde without measure to saue them selfes. The duke
of Exceter and his company seyng the force of the townes men more &amp;
more encreace, fled out of the backeside entendyng to repaire to the armie,
whiche they found dispersed and retired. Then the duke seing no
hope of cōfort, fled into Essex, and the erle of Glocester goyng toward
Wales was taken and beheaded at Bristowe. Magdalent fliyng into
Scotland was apprehēded and brought to the Tower. The lordes
whiche fought still in the towne of Chichester wer woūded to deth and
taken and their heades striken of and sent to London: and there were
taken sir Bennet Shelley or cell, and sir barnard Brokas and .xxix. other
Lordes Knightes and Esquiers &amp; sent to Oxford, where the kyng
then soiourned, where sir Thomas Blonte and all the other prysoners
were executed. Whē the Duke of Exceter hard that his complices wer
taken, and his councellers apprehēded, and his frendes and alies put
in execucion, he lamented his owne chaunce, and bewepte the misfortune
of his frendes, but most of all bewailed the fatall end of his brother
kyng Richard, whose death he saw as in a mirrour by his vnhappy
sedition and malicious attempte to approche, and so wanderynge
lurkyng and hidyng him selfe in priuy places, was attached in Essex,

and in the lordshippe of Plasshey a towne of the Duches of Glocester
and there made shorter by the hed, and in that place especially because
that he in the same Lordship seduced &amp; falcely betrayed Thomas duke
of Glocester, and was the very inward auctour and open dissimuler of
his death and destruction. So the cōmon Prouerbe was verified, as
you haue done, so shall you fele. Oh Lord I wolde wisshe that this example,
of many highlye promoted to rule, mighte be had in memorie,
the which mete and measure their owne iniquitie and il doinges, with
force auctoritie and power, to the entent that they by these exaumples
should auerte their myndes from ill doynges, and such vngodly and
execrable offences. After this Magdalein that represented the person
of kyng Richard amōgest the rebels, and diuerse other were put in execucion,
and all the heades of the chefe conspiratoures sette on polles
on London bridge, to the feare of other whiche were disposed to commit
like offence. The Abbot of Westminster in whose house this traiterous
confederacy was conspired, hearyng that the chefetains of his
felowshippe, were espied, taken and executed, going betwene his monastery
and mancion, for thoughte fell in a sodaine palsey, and shortely
after without any speche ended his life: after whome the Byshop of
Carlile more for feare then sickenes, rendred his spirite to God, as one
rather desiryng to die by deathes darte, then temporall swearde. But
nowe was come the time when al the confederates and compaignions
of this vnhappye sedicion, had tasted accordyng to their desertes, the
painfull penaunce of their pleasante pastime, or rather pestiferus obstinacy,
that an innocent with a nocēt, a man vngilty with a gilty, was
pondered in an egall balaunce. For pore king Richard ignorant of all
this coniuracion kept in miserable captiuitie, knowyng nothyng but
that he sawe in his chamber, was by king Henry adiudged to die, because
that he beyng singed and tickeled with the laste craftie policie of
his enemies, wold deliuer himself outof all inward feare aud discord,
and cleane put away the very ground wherof suche frutes of displeasure
mighte by any waie be attempted againste him, so that no man
hereafter shoulde ether faine or resemble to represente the persone of
king Richarde: wherfore some saye he commaunded, other talke that
he condiscended, many write that he knewe not tyll it was dooen, and
then it confirmed. But howe so euer it was, kyng Richarde dyed of
a violent death, without any infection or naturall disease of the body.
The common fame is that he was euery daye serued at the table with
costely meate like a kyng, to the entent that no creature shuld suspecte
any thing done contrary to the order taken in the parliment, and when
the meate was set before him, he was forbidden that he shuld not once
touch it, ye not to smel to it, and so died of famin: which kynd of death
is the most miserable, most vnnatural, ye and most detestable that can
be, for it is ten times more painefull then death (whiche of all extremities
is the most terrible) to die for thirst standyng in the riuer, or starue

for hunger, besette with twentie deintie disshes. One writer whiche
semed to haue muche knowledge of kyng Rychardes affaires, saieth
that kyng Henry sittyng at his table sore sighyng said, haue I no faithefull
frende whiche will deliuer me of him whose life wil be my deth,
and whose death wil be the preseruacion of my life. This saiyng was
muche noted of them whiche were present and especially of one called
sir Piers of Exton. This knight incontinently departed frō the court
with eight strong persons and came to Pomfret, commaundyng that
the esquier whiche was accustomed to sewe and take the assaye beefore
kyng Richard, shuld no more vse that maner of seruice, saiyng, let him
eate wel nowe, for he shall not long eate. Kyng Richard sate downe to
dyner and was serued without curtesie or assay, he muche meruailyng
at the sodaine mutacion of the thyng, demaunded of the Esquier why
he did not his duety? sir said he, I am otherwise cōmaunded by sir Pyers
of Exton, which is newely come from king Henry. When he heard
that worde, he toke the caruyng knife in his hand and strake the esquier
on the head saiyng, the deuell take Henry of Lancastre and the together:
and with that worde sir Piers entered into the chamber wel armed
with .viii. tal men in harneis, euery man hauing a bill in his hād.
Kyng Richarde perceuyng them armed, knewe well that they came to
his confusion, and puttyng the table from him, valiantly toke the bill
out of the first mannes hand, and manly defended himselfe, and slewe
fowre of them in a short space. Sir Piers benig sōwhat dismaied with
his resistyng, lepte into the chaire where kyng Richard was wonte to
sitte, while the other fowre persons assailed and chased him aboute the
chamber, whiche beyng vnarmed defended him againste his enemies
beyng armed, (whiche was a valiaunt acte) but in conclusion chasyng
and trauersing frō the one side to the other, he came by the chaire wher
sir Piers stode, whiche with a strooke of his Pollax felled hym to the
ground, and then shortely he was rid out of the worlde, without ether
confession or receit of sacrament. When this knight perceiued that he
was deade, he sobbed, wept, and rent his heare criyng, Oh Lord, what
haue we done, we haue murthered hym whom by the space of .xxii. yeres
we haue obeied as king, and honored as our soueraigne lord, now
all noble men will abhorre vs, all honest persons will disdaine vs, and
all pore people wil rayle and crie out vpon vs, so that duryng our naturall
liues, we shalbe poincted with the finger, and our posterite shal
be reproued as children of Homecides, ye of Regicides &amp; prince quellers.
Thus haue I declared to you the diuersities of opinions concernyng
the deathe of this infortunate prince, remittyng to your iudgement
whiche you thinke most trewe, but the very trouthe is that he died
of a violent death, and not by the darte of naturall infirmitie.
               When Atropos had cut the line of his lyfe, his body was embaulmed
and seared and couered with lead al saue his face (to the entent that al
men might perceiue that he was departed out of this mortal lyfe) and

was conueighed to London, where in the cathedrall churche of saincte
Paule he had a solempne obsequie, and from thence conueighed to Lā
                  gley
in Buckyngham shire, where he was enterred, and after by kyng
Henry the .v. remoued to Westminster, and there intombed honorably
with quene Anne his wife, although the Scottes vntreuly write that
he escaped out of prisone, and led a verteous and solitary life in Scotlande,
and there died and is buried in the blacke Friers at Sterlyng.
What trust is in this worlde, what suretie man hath of his life, &amp; what
constancie is in the mutable comonaltie, all men maie apparantly perceiue
by the ruyne of this noble prince, whiche beeyng an vndubitate
kyng, crouned and anoynted by the spiritualtie, honored and exalted
by the nobilitee, obeyed and worshipped of the comon people, was sodainly
disceiued by theim whiche he moste trusted, betraied by theim
whom he had preferred, &amp; slain by theim whom he had brought vp and
norished: so that all menne maie perceiue and see, that fortune wayeth
princes and pore men all in one balance.
               
                  VVHEN newes of kyng Richardes deposyng were reported into
Fraūce, kyng Charles and all his court wondered, detested &amp; abhorred
suchean iniurie to bee doen to an anoynted kyng, to a crouned prince, &amp;
to the hed of a realme: but in especial Waleram erle of sent Paule whiche
had maried kyng Richardes halfe sister, moued with high disdain
against kyng Henry, ceased not to stirre and prouoke ye Frenche kyng
and his counsaill to make sharpe warre in Englande, to reuenge the
iniurie and dishonor comitted and doen to his sonne in lawe kyng Richard,
&amp; he hymself sent letters of defiance to England. Whiche thyng
was sone agreed to, and an armie royall appoyncted with all spede, to
inuade England. But the Frenche kyng so stomacked this high disple
sure, &amp; so inwardly cōceiued this infortunate chance in his minde, that
he fell into his old diseace of the frenisy, that he had nede accordyng to
the old prouerbe, to saile into the Isle ofAnticyra is an Isle in Asia, wherein groweth an Herbe y• purgeth Melācoly, &amp; therof cā the prouerbe, go saile to Anticira, as who saieth, goo puro
                        •
                      youre Melancoly. Anticyra, to purge his melā
                  colie
humor, but by the meanes of his phisicions, he was somwhat releued
&amp; brought to knowledge of hymself. This armie was come doune
into Picardy, redy to be trāsported into Englād, but whē it was certainly
certified that kyng Richard was ded, &amp; that their enterprise of his
deliuerāce was frustrate &amp; voyd, tharmie scattred &amp; departed a sonder.
               
                  BVT whē the certaintie of kyng Richardes death was declared to
the Aquitaynes and Gascons, the moste parte of the wisest men of the
countree, fell into a greate bodely feare, and into a dedly dreade. For
some lamentyng the instabilitee of the Englishe people, iudged theim
to be spotted with perpetuall infamie, and brought to dishonor &amp; losse
of their aunciēt fame and glory, for comittyng so heynous a cryme and
detestable an offēce against their king &amp; soueraigne lorde. The memorie
wherof, thei thought would neuer be buried or extincted. Other fered
the losse of their goodes and liberties, because thei imagined that
by this ciuill discencion and intestine deuision, the realme of England

should so bee vexed and troubled, that their countree (if the Frenchemenne
should inuade it) should bee destitute and lefte voide of all aide
and succor of the Englishe nacion. But the citezens of Burdeaux toke
this matter very sore at ye stomacke, because kyng Richard was borne
and brought vp in their citee, lamentyng and criyng out, that sithe the
beginnyng of the worlde, there was neuer a more detestable, a more vilanous
nor a more heynous acte committed: whiche beyng sad with sorowe
and enflamed with malencolie, saied that vntrue, vnnaturall and
vnmercifull people had betrayed and slain, contrary to all law and iustice
and honestie, a good man, a iuste prince and politike gouernor.
Besechyng God deuoutly on their knees, to be the reuenger and punisher
of that detestable offence and notorius crime.
               
                  VVHEN the Frenchmen (whiche haue iyes of the wakyng serpent,
perceiued the dolor and agony that the Aquitaynes and Gascons wer
in for the death of their prince, duke and countrymanne, thei reioysed
and aplauded in maruelous maners, thynkyng with theimselfes that
(the Gascons nowe abhorryng and detestyng the Englishe men more
then a Dogge or an Adder) thei verie easely mighte obtain the whole
countree and douchie of Aquitaine, with the members and territories
there to apperteignyng, if thei would ether by entreatie or by inuasion
moue the people beyng now amased and comfortles, as shepe without
a shepeherd, or beastes without an herdman. Wherfore in greate haste
and slowe spede, Lewes duke of Burbon was sent to Angiers, &amp; wrote
to diuerse citees and tounes on the confynes of Aquitain and Gascon,
exhortyng them with large promises and flateryng wordes, to reuolte
and turne from the Englishe subieccion, and become vassals to the
croune of Fraunce. But al his glosyng wordes serued litle, and al his
faire promises profited muche lesse. For the people knewe that the Englishe
yoke was but a fether, &amp; the yoke of Fraunce, was more ponderus
then lede, seyng daily how the Frēch men vexed and molested ther
miserable people with extreme exacciōs and intollerable talleges, rasyng
their skinne to the very bone, and their purses to the very botome
wherfore thei determined rather to abide in their old subieccion and obedience,
then for a displeasure irrecurable to auenture themselfes on
a newe chance and a doubtfull parell.
               
                  KYNG Henry beeyng aduertised of al the Frenche attemptes and
couert conueighances, sent the lorde Thomas Percy erle of Worceter
with a goodly crewe of souldiours into Aquitain, to aide and assist sir
Robert Knolles his leuetenante there, and to perswade and exorte the
people to continewe in their ancient libertie and dewe obeysance. The
erle arriued there, and so wisely entreated the noble men, so grauously
perswaded the magestrates of the citees and tounes, and so gently and
familiarly vsed and tracted the vulgare people, that he not onely appeased
their furie and malice, but brought theim to a louyng and vniforme
obeysance, receiuyng of them othes of obedience and loyall fealtie,

whiche done he retourned againe into England with great thankes.
When kyng Charles of Fraunce perceiued that his purpose and
attempte was frustrate and came to no good conclusion in Aquitayne
and that kyng Richard being deade, his enterprise into England was
of no value and of small purpose, he determined with him selfe to inuent
some way howe to haue the Lady Isabell his doughter, somtime
espoused to kyng Richard restored to him again: and for that purpose
sent a solemne ambassade into England to kyng Henry, whiche gentely
receiued them, and gaue in answere that he wold send his commissioners
shortely to Caleis, whiche shoulde farther common and cōclude
with them, not onely that request, but diuers other matters of gret effecte
and efficacie. And shortely after their departyng he sent Edward
duke of Yorke, before called duke of Aumerle, whiche succeded in the
said duchie his father Edmond duke of Yorke, a littell before disseased
and Henry erle of Northumberland into the countrei of Guisnes. The
commissioners assembled at diuers places at sondry times. The duke
of Borbon aboue al thynges required in the name of the French king
his master, to haue quene Isabell to him deliuered. The Englishmen
that to do continually did deny, requiryng to haue her maried to Henry
Prince of Wales, a man bothe in blud and age to her in al thinges
equall. But the Frenche kyng that mariage vtterly refused, saiyng
he wolde neuer ioyne affinitie after with the Englishe nacion, because
that the aliance had so vnfortunate successe.
               Then they began to entreate a continuall peace, whiche request the
Frenchemen refused, and in conclusion their agreed that the truce whiche
was taken betwene them and kyng Richarde, for the terme of .xxx.
yeres, was renouate and confirmed. Some authors affirm that there
was a newe leage concluded and confirmed betwene both the realmes
duryng the liues of bothe the princes, whiche semeth to haue a certein
colour of veritie. For the kyng sent shortly after the foresaid Lady Isabell
vnder the conducte of the Lord Thomas Percy erle of Worceter,
associate with many noble and honourable personages, as well of
women, as men, hauyng with her al the Iewelles ornamentes &amp; plate
(with a gret surplusage geuen to hir by the kyng whiche she brought
into England) was sente in solemne estate to Caleis, and there deliuered
to Waleran erle of sainct Paule Lieuetenant for the French king
in Picardie, and so conueighed to her father, whiche gaue her in mariage
to Charles sōne to Lewes duke of Orleaunce. The Frenchmen
often times required king Henry to assigne to her a dower, but al was
in vaine, for the Englishemen answered that the matrimony was neuer
consummate, by reason wherof she was not dowable, by the very
treatie of the mariage concluded, and so this matter seased, and was
no more moued. As the old prouerbe saith, after winde commeth rain,
&amp; after one euil comōly ensueth another, so duryng the time that kyng
Henry was vexed and vnquieted, bothe within the realme &amp; without.
               
                  
                  OVVEN Glendor a squire of Wales, perceiuyng the realme to be
vnquieted, and the kyng not yet to be placed in a lure and vnmouable
seate, entēdyng to vsurpe and take vpon hym the principalitie of Wales,
and the name and preheminence of thesame, what with faire flatteryng
wordes and with large promises, so enuegled entised and allured
the wilde and vndiscrite Welshmen, that thei toke hym as their prince
and made to hym an othe of aliegeance and subieccion. By whose supportacion,
he beyng elated and set vp in aucthorite, to the intent to bee
out of all doubte of his neighbors, made sharpe warre on Reignolde
lorde Grey of Rithen and toke hym prisoner, promisyng hym libertee
and dischargyng his raunsome, if he would espouse and marie his
doughter, thynkyng by that affinitie, to haue greate aide and muche
power in Wales. The lorde Grey beeyng not very riche nether of substance
nor of frendes, consideryng this offer to be the onely waie of his
releffe and deliuerance, assented to his pleasure and maried the damosell.
But this false father in lawe, this vntrew, vnhonest and periured
persone, kept hym with his wife still in captiuitee till he died. And not
cōtent with this heynous offence, made warre on lorde Edmond Mortimer
erle of Marche, and in his owne lordship of Wigmore, where in
a conflict he slewe many of therles men and toke hym prisoner, and fete
ryng hym in chaynes, cast hym in a depe and miserable dongeon. The
kyng was required to purchase his deliuerance by diuerse of the nobilitie,
but he could not heare on that side, rather he would and wished al
his linage in heuen. For then his title had been out of all doubt &amp; question,
and so vpon this cause as you heare, after ensued great sedicion.
               
                  THVS Owen Glendor glorifiyng hymself in these twoo victories,
inuaded the Marches of Wales on the West side of Seuerne, robbed
vilages, brent tounes, and slewe the people, and laden with praies and
bloudy 
                     •
                  andes returned again into Wales, neuer desistyng to do euil
till the next yere, that the kyng reised a greate armie and puissance to
resist and defende his malicious attemptes and sedicious inuasions,
as after shal be declared. It was not sufficiēt in this first yere of kyng
Henry, this realme to be troubled with domestical sedicion, vexed with
the craftie practices and inuencions of the Frenche men, and inuaded
and infested with the frantike waueryng Welshemen, but also fortune
hauyng enuy at the glory and fortunate procedyng of this man, muste
in his saied firste yere also, arme the Scottes with spere and shelde against
hym and his realme, wherof the occasion shall bee to you declared
accordyng to the Scotticall histories. A litle before this tyme,
George of Dunbarr erle of the Marches of the realme, made meanes
to kyng Robert of Scotlande, that Dauid his eldest sonne might marie
and espouse the erles doughter called Elizabeth, and deliuered for
the performance of thesame mariage, into the kynges handes a greate
some of money. When Archebaulde erle Douglas heard of this conclucion,
disdainyng therle of the Marches blud to be auaunced before

his stocke, wherfore ether by faire wordes, or els by disbursyng a greter
some of money, he so enuegeled Kyng Roberte of Scotlande, that
Dauid his heire refusyng the first damosell, espoused Mariell the erle
Douglas doughter. Therle of Marche desired restitucion of his money,
to whom the kyng gaue many friuolus and trifelyng aunsweres,
wherfore he disdainyng so to bee mocked &amp; deluded of his money, with
his wife and family, fled into England, to Henry erle of Northumberlande,
entendyng with dent of swerd to reuenge the iniury &amp; displesure
to hym by the kyng comitted &amp; doen, &amp; so with the help of the borderers
brent diuerse tounes, &amp; slew many persons in the realme of Scotland.
               
                  KYNG Roberte beeyng thereof aduertised, firste depriued the
Erle George of all his dignitees and possessions, and caused his
goodes to bee confiscate, and after wrote to the Kyng of Englande,
instantly requiryng hym, if he would the truce any longer to continew
ether to deliuer into his possession the Erle of Marche, and other traitors
and rebelles to his persone and realme, or els to banishe and exile
theim out of his realme, territories and dominions. Kyng Henry
discretly answered the herault of Scotland, that the worde of a prince
ought to bee kepte, and his writyng and seale ought to bee inuiolate,
and consideryng that he had graunted a saue conduite to the erle and
his compaigny, he would nether without cause resonable breake his
promise, nor yet deface his honor. Whiche answer declared to the kyng
of Scottes, he incontinente did proclaime and intimate open warre, against
the kyng of England, with bloud fire and sweard. Kyng Henry
perceiuyng, that policie preuenteth chance, gathred and assembled together
a greate armie, and entered into Scotlande, burnyng townes
villages and castles, sparyng nothyng but religious houses and churches,
and brent a greate parte of the tounes of Edenbrough and Lithe
and beseged the castle of Maidens in Edenbrough, in thende of September,
whereof was capitain, Dauid duke of Rothsay and prince of
the realme, and Archibalde erle Douglas, with many hardy men. Roberte
duke of Albanie, beyng appoyncted gouernor of the realme, because
the kyng was sicke and vnapt to rule, sent vnto kyng Henry an
harrold, assuryng hym on his honour that if he would abide and tary
his coming and repaire, whiche should be within sixe daies at the most
he would geue hym battaill, and remoue the siege, or els die for it.
               The kyng beeyng glad of these ioyous good newes, rewarded the
herault with a goune of silke and a chayne of gold, promisyng hym in
the worde of a prince, not to depart thence but abide there, the comyng
of the gouernor. The sixe daies passed, ye sixe and sixtene to, the gouernor
nether apered nor sent worde, the winter waxed cold, vitaile failed,
men died of the flixe, it rained euery daie so habundantly, that hunger
and colde caused the kyng to breke vp his siege, and to departe out of
Scotland, without battaill or skirmish offered. Duryng whiche tyme
bothe the Wardens of the Marches beyng with the kyng, the Scottes

made a rode into Northumberlande, and burned diuerse tounes in
Bamborough shere, and shortly returned again, or els thei had been
trapped &amp; come to late home. When the kyng of England had dismis
                  
                     •
                  ed
his souldiers, and discharged his army, the Scottes entendyng to
bee reuenged of their greate domages to theim by the Englishe naciō
doen and committed by therle Douglas, appoyncted twoo armyes to
inuade Englande. Of the first was chieftain, sir Thomas Halibarton
of Dirlton, and Patrike Hebburne of Hales, whiche made a rode into
Englande, and returned with litle losse and no greate gain. After this
the 
                     •
                  orsaid sir Patrike Hebburne, encoraged &amp; boldened with the prosperous
successe of this first iorney, with a greate armie of the people of
Lowdian inuaded Northumberlande, robbyng and spoylyng the coū
                  tree
and departed homeward, not without greate gain of beastes and
captiues. But in the returne he was encoūtered with therle of Northumberlandes
vicewarden, &amp; other gentilmen of the borders at a toune
in Northumberlande called Nes
                     •
                  it, and there the Englshemen sore assailed,
and the Scottes valiantly resisted, but after a long fight, the
victory fell on the Englishe parte, and as Ihon Mayer the Scot writeth,
there wer slain the flower of all Loughdean, and especially sir Patricke
Hebburne with many of his linage. There wer apprehended sir
Ihon and Willyam Cockeburne, sir Robert of Bas, Ihon and Thomas
Hablincton esquiers, and a greate nomber of the comon people.
The erle Douglas sore beyng greued with the losse of his nacion and
frendes, entendyng a requitement if it were possible of thesame, by the
consente of the gouernour of Scotlande, did gather a houge armie of
twentie thousande talle menne and more.
               In the whiche armie was Lord Mordake earle of Fife sonne to the
gouernour of Scotland, the erle of Angus, and many other erles and
barons of the nobilitie of Scotland. These valiaunte capitayns and
couragious souldioures entered into Northumberlande with banners
displayed like menne ether apte or thynkyng theim selfes able to
destroy the townes and spoyle the countrey and Marches of Northumberlande.
When thei wer entered into England thinkyng no puissaunce
able to encounter with their force, out of a valey beside a toune
called Homeldon issued sodainly the Lorde Henry Percie, whom the
Scottes for his haut and valiant corage calledsir Henry hotspur, and
in his company the Lorde George of Dunbar erle of Marche before
banished Scotlande, as you haue heard, with al the gentill menne
of Northumberland, and eight thousande men on horsebacke and on
fote. The encounter was sharpe, the fight was daungerous, the long
continuaunce was doubtfull, for some were felled and rescued, some in
reseuyng other were slaine, other gredy of praye more then of strokes
fled to se what baggages were kept emongest the Pages. Thus with
pure fightyng of the Englishemen, and fainte hertes of the bragging
Scottes, the brighte beame of victory shone on sainct Georges crosse,

and there were slaine of men of great renoune and estimacion sir Ihō
Swinton▪ sir Adam Gordon; sir Ihon Leuiston, sir Alexander Ransey
of Dalehowse, and .xxiii. knightes moo, Whose names ether for
ignorance or for feare of reproche, Hector Boece the Scottish archechronocler
kepeth in silence and dothe omitte, beside .x.M. cōmons.
But there wer taken prisoners, Mordacke erle of Fife, Archebald erle
Douglas, whiche in the combat loste one of his eyes, Thomas erle of
Murrey, Robert erle of Angus, and as other writers affirme, the erls
of Athell and Montethe with .v.C. other.
               When the Lord Percy had thus obtained this glorious victory, he
sent his prisoners into diuerse fortresses, and determyned to subdue
or destroy all the countreis of Lowdene and Marche, whose heades
and Gouernours ether he had slain or by force taken captiues. And so
with a gret power entered into Tiuedale wastyng and destroiyng the
hole countrey, and they beseged the castell of Cokelaues, wherof was
capitain sir Ihon Grenlowe, which seyng that his castel was not long
able to be defended cōpounded with the Englishmen that yf the castel
wer not suckered within .iii. monthes, that then he wold deliuer it into
the Englishe mennes handes. The capitaine thereof wrote vnto the
Gouernour, whiche callyng a great councell, the moste parte aduised
hym rather frankely and frely to yeld the castel, than to put in ieopardie
and caste in hasard the remnaunt of the florishyng nobilitie of the
realme. So muche was their courages abated and their fumishe crakes
refrigerat with the remembraunce of the last conflicte and batail.
But the gouernour rebukyng their timerous heartes, and Feminine
audacitie (whether he thought so or no was a questiō) sware that if no
man wold folowe of the nobilitie he woulde do his deuoire to reskewe
the castell at the day. But his othe was nether kept nor broken, for he
litell preparyng and lesse entendyng the oth whiche he solemply made
neuer set fote forward duryng the first .ii. monethes, for the reisyng of
the siege or reskewe of the castel. But the Englishe men beyng sent for
to go with the kyng into Wales, raysed their siege and departed leauyng
the noble men prisoners styll with the earle of Northumberland
and the Lord Percie his sonne, which by the kyng were commaunded
to kepe them to his vse, and not to deliuer them without his assent.
               
                  KYNG Henry forgat not his enterprise into Wales,The second yere. but made prouision
for menne, municions and artillary mete and conuenient for so
great a businesse, whereof the Frenche kyng beyng aduertised, sente
priuilie Lorde Iames of Burbone earle of Marche and his two brethren
Ihon and Lewes, with .xii.C. knightes and esquiers to aide Owen
Glendor against the inuasions of kyng Henry, he toke shippyng
with .xxx. saile at the mouthe of Seine, and the wynd was not fauourable
to his purpose for he coulde neuer approche the coaste of Wales
but came before the towne of Plimmouthe in Deuonshire, and there
leauyng his great shippes liyng at ancre, in the nyghte toke land and

brent, spoiled and destroied diuers small villages, and poore cotages,
and robbed .v. or .vi. littel Craiers and fisher botes laden with fysshe
and corne. But while he and his companie like gredy wolfes were sekyng
after their praie, the winde rose highe and a great tempesteous
rage and furious storme sodainely flusshed and drowned .xii. of his
great shippes whiche laie in the mouthe of the hauen for his safegard
and defence. Wherof when the erle was aduertised, and perceuyng by
the firyng of the beacons that the people began to assemble in plumpes
to encounter with him, and also seyng his power sore diminshed
as well by the slaughter of suche as ranged abrode in hope of spoyle
and praye, as by the furious rage of the vnmercifull see and hydeous
tempest, with muche paine and great labour toke his shippes againe,
and was not without ieopardie of his lyfe driuen on the coast of Britaine
and landed at sainct Malos. The French kyng perceiuyng that
this chāce had il successe, apointed one of his Marshals called Memorancie,
and the maister of his Crosbowes with .xii.M. men, to saile in
to Wales, which toke shippyng at Brest and had the winde to them so
prosperous that they landed at Milford hauen, and leauing the castel
of Penbroke vnassaulted, because it was well fortified, manned, and
vitailed, besieged the towne of Harforde West whiche was so wel defended
by the erle of Arundell and his power that they much more lost
then gained. And from thence they departed towarde Owen Glendor
whome they nominated prince of Wales, and founde him at the towne
of Dinbigh abidyng their cōmyng with ten thousand men. They wer
of him louingly receiued, and gentelly enterteined, and when al thynges
were prepared, thei passed by Glamorgan shire toward Worcester
and there brent the suburbes, but hearyng of the kynges approchyng
sodainly retourned into Wales. The king with a great puissaunce folowed
and founde them embattailed on a highe mountaine, and a gret
valey betwene bothe the armies, so that eche armie plainely perceiued
other, and euery hoste loked to be assauted of his aduersary, and of the
groūd to take the most aduaūtage: thus they cōtinued eight daies frō
mornyng to nyght ready to abide but not to geue battaile. There wer
many fearce skirmishes and many propre feates of armes daily done,
whiche the French Croniclers more then the Englishe writers can reporte.
For there were slaine the Lorde Patrioles of Tries, brother to
the Marshall of France, the Lord Mattelone and the Lord Uale and
the bastarde of Burbon, with .v. hundred gentelmen.
               The Frenche men and Welshe men were sore trobeled and afflicted
with famine, that their hertes were appalled and their corages sore abated,
for the kyng had so stopped the passages that nether vitayl nor
succour could by any way be conueighed to thē. Wherfore of very necessitie
they were compelled eyther to fyghte or flee: And so by the aduisement
and councell of the Marshall of Fraunce, whiche put not to
muche confidence in the waueryng Welshemen, the hole hoste departed

theight day at midnight in the most secretes maner that thei could
deuise. The Frenche men with littel rewardes and no gaine returned
into Britayne makyng small boast of their painfull iourney.
               
                  THE kyng seyng them departed, folowed thē into Wales, and chasing
them from hilles to dales, from dales to woddes, from woddes to
marishes, and yet could neuer haue them at any aduauntage. A world
it was to see his quotidiane remouyng, his painfull and busi wanderyng,
his troblesome and vncertaine abidyng, his continual mocion,
his daily peregrinacion in the desert, felles and craggy mountains of
that bareine vnfertile and depopulate countrey. And thus beyng tossed
from countrey to countrey, from hill to vale, from marishe to wod,
from noughte to worsse, without gaine or profite, withoute vitayle or
succour, he was of necessitie cōpelled to retire his armie and retourne
againe to Worcester, in whiche retournyng the Welshemen knowing
the passages of the countrey, toke certaine cariages of his laden with
vitayle to his great displeasure, and their great comforte. When he
came to Worcester perceiuyng winter to approche which season of the
yere is not conuenient and proper for men of warre to lie in the feldes,
and specially in suche a barraine and hilly countrey as Wales is, dispersed
his armie for that time and returned to London. In the meane
time while the kyng was thus occupied in Wales, certain malicious
and cruel persons enuiyng and malignyng in their heartes that king
Henry contrary to the opinion of many, but against the wil of mo had
so shortely obteigned and possessed the realme and regalitie, blased abrode
&amp; noised daily amongest the vulgare people that kyng Richard
(whiche was openly sene dead) was yet liuyng and desired aide of the
common people to reposesse his realme and roiall dignitie. And to the
furtheraunce of the fantasticall inuencion partly moued with indignacion,
partely incensed with furious inalencolie, set vpon postes and
caste aboute the stretes railyng rimes, malicious meters and tauntyng
verses against kyng Henry and his procedynges. He beyng netteled
with these vncurteous ye vnuertuous prickes &amp; thornes, serched
out the authours, and amongest other were found culpable of this offence
and crime, sir Roger Claryngdon knight, and eight gray Friers
whiche according to their merites and desertes were strangeled at Tiborne
and there put in execucion. I may not here forget to shewe you
howe that kyng Henry sekyng nowe affinitie and frendshippe in Germanie
sent this yere his eldest doughter Blaunche accompanied with
the Erle of Sommerset, the Bishop of Worcester, and the Lord Clifforde,
and other noble personages into Almaine. whiche brought her
to Coleyne, and there with great triumphe she was maried to Willyam
Duke of Bauier, sonne and heire to Lewes of Bauier the Emperour,
in whiche yere also died Lady Katherine Swinsford the thyrde
wife of Ihon of Gaunt duke of Lancastre father to this kyng Henry,
&amp; was buried at Lincolne. In the same yere kyng Henry maried Iane

Duches of Britaine late wife to Ihon duke of Britaine at the citie of
Winchester and with triumphal pompe conueighed her thorow the citie
of London to Westminster, and there she was crowned Quene.
               While these thynges were thus doyng in England Waleran Erle of
sainct Paule whiche had maried the halfe sister of Richard, hauyng a
malicious heart and a deadly hatred to Kyng Henry, assēbled a great
company of men of warre to the nomber of .xvi. or .xviii.C. whereof
the greatest parte were noble men, and made great prouisiō of al thinges
necessary for his feate and enterprise. And on sainct Nicholas day
entered into his shippes at Harflete and landed in the Isle of Wight,
and when he sawe no apperaunce of defence, he burned two poore villages
and .iiii. simple cottages, and for great triumphe of this noble
acte he made .iiii. knightes: but sodainly when he was aduertysed by
his espials that the people of the Isle wer assembled and approched to
fight with hym. He with al haste possible toke his shippes and retourned
home againe, wherwith the noble men of his company were much
discontente and displeased, consideryng that his prouision was great
and his gaine smal or none. And in the same very season Ihon Erle of
Cleremount sonne to the Duke of Burbone, wonne in Gascoigne the
castelles of sainct Peter, saincte Marie and the newe castell, and the
Lord Delabrethe wonne the castell of Carlaffin, whiche was no small
losse to the Englishe nacion: Duryng which time died Philippe duke
of Burgoin, and duke Albert of Bauier Erle of Henault.
            
            
               ¶The thirde yere.The .iii▪ yere.
               
               
                  IN this yere appered a comete or blasyng Starre of a houge
quantitie by a long season which as the Astronomers affirmed,
signified great effusion of mannes blud, which iudgement
was not frustrate as you shal perceiue. For Henry erle
of Northumberland and Thomas erle of Worcester his brother, and
his sonne Lord Henry Percy called hotspur, which were to king Henry
in the beginnyng of his reigne bothe fautours frendes and aiders,
perceiuyng nowe that he had pacified all domesticall sedicion and repressed
his enemies, and reduced his realm to a conuenient quietnes,
began somwhat to enuie the glory of hym, and grudged agaynste his
welthe and felicitie. And specially greued, because the kyng demaunded
of the Earle and his sonne suche Scottishe prisoners as they had
taken at the conflictes fought at Homeldon and Nesbit as you before
haue heard. For of all the captiues whiche were there taken, ther was
deliuered to the kynges possession onely Mordake earle of Fife sonne
to the duke of Albanie Gouernour of Scotland, for the king them diuers
and sondry times of therle and his sonne required. But the Percies
affirmyng them to be their owne propre prisoners and their peculiar
praies, and to deliuer theym vtterly denaied, insomuche that the
kyng openly saied that if they wolde not deliuer them, he woulde take
them without deliuerance. Wherwith they beyng sore discōtent, by the

councell of Lord Thomas Percy erle of Worcester, whose study was
euer to procure malice, and to set al thynges in broile and vncertentie,
fainyng a cause to proue and tempte the kyng, came to him to Wyndsor,
requiryng him by raunsome or otherwise to cause to bee deliuered
out of prison Edmond Mortimer erle of Marche their cosyn germain
whome (as they reported) Owen Glendor kepte in filthy prison shakeled
with yrons, onely for that cause that he toke his parte, and was to
hym faithful and trewe. The kyng began not a litell to muse on this
request, and not without a cause, for in dede it touched him as nere as
his sherte, as you well may perceiue by the Genealogy rehersed in the
beginnyng of this story. For this Edmond was sonne to Earle Roger
whiche was sonne to Lady Philip doughter to Lionell Duke of Clarence,
the third sonne to kyng Edward the third, whiche Edmonde at
kyng Richardes going into Ireland was proclaimed heire apparant
to the croune and realme, whose Aunt called Elinor this Lord Henry
Percie had Maried. And therfore the kyng litell forced although that
that lignage were clerely subuerted and vtterly extincte.
               
                  VVHEN the kyng had long digested and studied on this matter,
he made aunswere and sayd that the Earle of Marche was not taken
prisoner neither for his cause nor in his seruice, but willyngly suffered
him selfe to be taken, because he woulde take no parte againste Owen
Glendor and his complices, and therfore he woulde nether raunsome
nor releue hym, whiche fraude the kyng caused openly to be published
and diuulged, with whiche aunswere if the parties were angry doubt
you not. But with the publyshyng of the cautell, that the Earle of
Marche was willyngly taken, they ten times more fumed and raged
in so muche that sir Henry hotspur said openly: Behold the heire of the
realme is robbed of his righte, and yet the robber, with his owne, wyl
not redeme hym. So in this fury the Percies departed, nothyng more
mindyng then to depose kyng Henry from the high tipe of his regalitie,
and to deliuer and set in his trone their cosyn frende &amp; confederate
Edmonde Earle of Marche, whome they not onely deliuered oute of
the captiuitie of Owen Glendor, but also entered into a leage and amitie
with the said Owen against king Henry and al his frendes and
fautours, to the great displeasure and long vnquieting of kyng Henry
and his partakers. Here I passe ouer to declare howe a certayne
writer writeth that this earle of Marche, the Lorde Percy and Owen
Glendor wer vnwisely made beleue by a Welsh Prophecier, that king
Henry was the Moldwarpe, cursed of Goddes owne mouth, and that
they thre were the Dragon, the Lion and the Wolffe, whiche shoulde
deuide this realme betwene them, by the deuiacion and not deuinaciō
of that mawmet Merlin. I wyll no
                     •
                   reherse howe they by their deputies
in the howse of the Archdeacon of Bangor, seduced with that
falce fained Prophesie deuided the realme amongest thē, nor yet write
howe by a tripartie endenture sealed with their seales, all Englande

from Seuerne and Trent South and Eastward, was assigned to the
erle of Marche: Nor how all Wales and the landes beyond Seuerne
Westward, were appoincted to Owen Glendor, and all the remnaunt
from Trente Northwarde to the lorde Percie. But I will declare to
you that whiche was not prophesied, that is the confusion destruccion
and perdicion of these persones, not onely geuyng credite to suche a
vain fable, but also settyng it forwarde and hopyng to attaine to the
effecte of thesame whiche was especiall of the lorde Percie and Owen
Glendor. For the erle of Marche was euer kepte in the courte vnder
suche a keper that he could nether doo or attempte any thyng againste
the kyng without his knowledge, and died without issue, leuyng his
righte title and interest to Anne his sister and heire, maried to Rycharde
erle of Cambrige father to the duke of Yorke, whose ofspryng
in continuaunce of tyme, obteigned the game and gat the garland. O
ye waueryng Welshmen, call you these prophesies? nay call theim vnprofitable
practises. Name you them diuinacions? nay name them diabolicall
deuises, say you thei be prognosticacions? nay thei be pestiferous
publishinges. For by declaryng &amp; credite geuing to their subtil &amp;
obscure meanynges, princes haue been deceiued, many a noble manne
hath suffred, and many an honest man hath been begyled &amp; destroyed.
               
                  KYNG Henry knowyng of this newe confederacy, and nothyng
lesse myndyng then that that happened after, gathered a greate
armye too goo agayne into Wales: whereof the Erle of Northumberlande
and his sonne wer aduertised, by lorde Thomas erle of Wocester,
and with all diligence raysed all the power that thei could make
and sent to the Scottes whiche before wer taken prisoners at Hamaldon
for aide and men, promisyng the erle Douglas the toune of Barwicke
and a parte of Northumberlande: and to other Scotishe lordes
greate lordshippes and segniories, if thei obteigned the vpper hande
and superioritee. The Scottes allured with desire of gain, and for no
malice that thei bare to kyng Henry, but somewhat desierous to be reuenged
of their olde greues, came to the erle with greate compaignie,
and to make their cause seme good and iuste, thei deuised certain articles
by the aduise of Richard Scrope Archebishop of Yorke, brother
to the lorde Scrope, whom kyng Henry caused to bee beheded at Bristow
as you haue heard before. Whiche articles thei shewed to diuerse
noble men and prelates of the realme, whiche fauouryng and concentyng
to their purpose, not onely promised them aide and succor by wordes,
but by their writyng and seales confirmed thesame. Howbeit, whether
it wer for feare, ether for that thei would be lokers on and no dede
doers, nether promise by worde or by writyng was performed. For al y•
confederates them abādoned, &amp; at the daie of the conflict left alone the
erle of Stafford only excepte, whiche beyng of a haute corage and hye
stomacke, kept his promise &amp; ioined with the Percies to his destrucciō
               
               
                  THE lorde Percy with therle Douglas and other erles of Scotlād

with a greate armie, departed out of the Northparties, leuyng his father
sicke (whiche promised vpon his amendment &amp; recouery without
delay to folowe) and came to Stafford where his vncle therle of Worcester
and he met, and there began to consult vpon their great affaires
and high attempted enterprice, there thei exhorted their souldiers and
compaignions to refuse no pain for the auancemente of the common
wealth, nor to spare no trauell for the libertie of their countree: protestyngopenly
that thei made warre onely (to restore the noble realme of
England to his accustomed glory and fredō, whiche was gouerned by
a tirant and not by his lawfull and right kyng. The capitaines sware
and the souldiers promised to fight, ye &amp; to dye for the libertie of their
countree. When all thynges was prepared, thei set forwarde towarde
Wales, lokyng euery houre for new aide and succors, noysyng abrode
that thei came to aide the kyng against Owen Glendor. The kyng heryng
of the erles approchyng, thought it policie to encounter with thē
before that the Welshmē should ioyne with their armie, and so include
hym on bothe partes, and therefore returned sodainly to the toune of
Shrewesbury. He was skantely entered into the toune, but he was by
his postes aduertised that the erles with baners displaied and battailes
ranged, wer comyng towarde hym, and were so hote and so coragious,
that thei with light horses began to skirmishe with his hoste. The
Kyng perceiuyng their dooynges, issued out and encamped hymself
without the Estgate of the toune. Therles nothing abashed although
their succors theim deceiued, embattailed themselfes not farr from the
kynges armie. And thesame night thei sēt the articles wherof I spake
before, by Thomas Kaiton and Thomas Saluaine esquiers to kyng
Henry, signed with their handes and sealed with their seales, whiche
articles (because no Chronicler saue one, maketh mēcion what was the
very cause and occasion of this great bloudy battaile, in the whiche on
bothe partes wer aboue fourty thousande men assembled) I worde for
worde accordyng to my copie do here reherce.

Glendor in a pitched and foughten feld, and cast into prisone and ladē
with yron fetters, for thy matter and cause, whom falsely thou hast proclaymed
willyngly to yelde hymself prisoner to thesaied Owen Glendor,
and nether wouldest deliuer hym thy self, nor yet suffre vs his kinsmen

onely concluded and agreed with thesame Owen for his raunsome
at our propre charges and expences, but also for a peace betwene thee
and thesaid Owen. Why hast thou then not onely published and declared
vs as traytors, but also craftely and deceitfully imagened, purposed
and conspired the vtter destruccion and confusion of our persones.
For the whiche cause we defy thee, thy fautoures and complices as comen

                  VVHEN Kyng Henry had ouerseen their articles and defiance, he
answered the esquiers that he was redy with dent of swerde and fierce
battaill to proue their quarell false and fayned, and not with writyng
nor slanderous wordes, 
                     •
                  nd so in his righteous cause and iust quarell
he doubted not but God would bothe aide and assiste hym, against vntrue
persones and false forsworne traytours: with whiche answere the
messengers departed. The next daie in the mornyng early, which was
the vigile of Mari Magdalene, the kyng perceiuyng that the battaill
was nerer then he ether thoughte or loked for, leste that long tariyng
might be a minishyng of his strength, set his battailles in good ordre:
likewise did his enemies, whiche bothe in puissance and courage were
nothyng to hym inferior. Then sodainly the trumpettes blew, the kynges
parte cried sainct George vpon them: The aduersaries cried Esperaunce

Percie, and so furiously the armies ioyned. The Scottes whiche
had the forward on the lordes side, entendyng to bee reuenged of their
old displeasures doen to them by the Englishe nacion, set so fiersely on
the kynges forward, that thei made them drawe backe, and had almost
broken their arraie. The Welshemen also whiche sithe the kynges departure
out of Wales, had lurked and lien in wooddes mountaignes
and marishes, heryng of this battaill towarde, came to the aide of the
erles, and refreshed the wery people with new succurs. When a ferfull
messenger had declared to the kyng, that his people wer beaten doune
on euery side, it was no nede to bid hym stirre, for sodainly he approched
with his freshe battaill, and comforted, hertened and encouraged
his par
                     •
                   so, that thei toke their hertes to theim, and manly fought with
their enemi
                     •
                  s. The prince Henry that daie holpe muche his father, for
although he wer sore woūded in the face with an arow, yet he neuer ceased
ether to fight where the battaill was moste strongest, or to courage
his men where their hertes was moste danted. This greate battail cō
                  tinued
thre long houres with indifferēt fortune on bothe partes. That
at the last the kyng criyng sainct George, victory, brake the arraie and
entered into the battaill of his enemies and fought fiersely, and auentured
so far into the battaill, that the erle Douglas strake hym doune
and slewe sir Water 
                     •
                  lonte, and three other appareled in the kynges
suite and clothyng saiyng: I maruaill to see so many kynges so sodainly
arise again, the kyng was reised and did that daie many a noble
feate of armes. For as the Scottes write and Frenche men affirme, all
though that Englishemen kepe silence, that he hymself slewe with his
handes that daie ▪xxxvj. persones of his enemies, the other of his parte
encoraged by his doynges, fought valiantly and slew the lorde Percie
called sir Henry hotspurre, the best capitain on the part aduerse. When
his death was knowen, the Scottes fled, the Welshemen ran, the traitors
wer ouercome, then nether wooddes letted, nor hilles stopped the
fearfull hertes of theim that wer vanquished to flie, and in that flighte
therle Douglas, whiche for hast fallyng from the cragge of a mountagnie
brake one of his genitals and was taken, and for his valiantnes
of the kyng frely &amp; frankely deliuered. There was taken also sir Thomas
Percie erle of Worcester &amp; diuerse other, on the kynges parte wer
slain sir Water Blount and .xvi.C. other persones, but on the parte of
the rebelles were slain the erle of Stafford, the lorde Percie and aboue
fiue thousand other, and as for the Scottes few or none escaped aliue.
               
                  AFTER this glorious victory by the kyng obteigned, he rendered
to almightie God his humble and hertie thankes, and caused therle of
Worcester the morowe after Mary Magdaleine, at Shrewesbury 
                     •
                  o
be drawen hanged and quartered, and his hed to be sent to London, at
whiche place many mo capitaines wer executed. After this greate battaill,
he like a triumphante conqueror returned with greate pompe to
London, where he was by the senate and magestrates solemply receiued,

not a litle reioysyng of his good fortune and fortunate victorye.
But before his departure from Shrewesbury, he not forgettyng his
enterprise against Owen Glendor, sent into Wales with a great a
                     •
                  my
prince Henry his eldest sonne against thesaid Owen and his sedicious
fautors, whiche beyng dismaied and in maner desperate of all comfort
by the reson of the kynges late victory, fled in desert places and solitary
caues, where he receiued afinall reward mete and prepared by goddes
prouidence for suche a rebell and sedicious seducer. For beyng destitute
of all comforte, dreadyng to shewe his face to any creature, lackyng
meate to sustain nature, for pure hunger and lacke of fode miserably
ended his wretched life. This ende was prouided for suche as
gaue credence to false prophesies. This ende had thei that by diabolical
deuinacions wer promised great possessions and seigniories. This
ende happeneth to suche as beleuyng suche fantasticall folies, aspire
and gape for honor and high promocions. When the prince with litle
labor and lesse losse, had tamed &amp; brideled the furious rage of the wild
and sauage Welshemen, and lefte gouernors to rule and gouerne the
countree, he returned to his father with great honor &amp; no small praise.
The erle of Northumberland heryng of the ouerthrowe of his brother
and sonne, came of his owne free will to the kyng, excusyng hymself as
one nether party nor knowyng of their doyng nor enterprice: the kyng
nether accused him nor held hym excused, but dissimuled the matter for
ij. causes, one was he had Berwicke in his possession, whiche the kyng
rather desired to haue by polici then by force: the other was that therle
had his castelles of Alnewicke, Warkeworth and other fortified with
Scottes, so that if therle wer apprehēded, all Northumberland wer in
ieoperdy to become Scottish. For these cause y• kyng gaue hym faire
wordes &amp; let hym depart home, wher he continued inpeace a while, but
after he rebelled as you shall perceiue by the sequele of this story.

                  THis yere Waleram erle of sent Pole, considryng that he had
defied kyng Henry, and also that he had made diuerse voyages,
and doen litle damage to the Englishnacion, and susteigned
muche losse, continuyng in his olde malice against the
kyng of England, by the assent of the Frenche kyng assembled a great
numbre of men of warre, as .v.C. men of armes .v.C. Genewaies with
Crosebowes, and a .M. Flemynges on fote, and laied siege to the Castell
of Marke thre leages frō Caleis, within the territory of the kyng
of Englande, the .xvi. daie of Iuly, wherof was capitain Philip Halle
esquier, with .lxxx. archers and .xxiiii. other souldiers. Therle raised against
the Castle diuerse engines but thei preuailed not, for thei within
shot so fersly, and cast out stones so incessantly, and toke suche paine
that to the hearers it is almoste incredible. The erle perceiuyng that
his feate had suche successe as he loked for, retired with his men lodged
in the toune, fortifiyng thesame for fere of rescous that might issue

from Caleis, the next day he gaue a sore assaute again, and with great
force entered the vtter court of the castle, and toke therin a great number
of horse kyen and catell, at the whiche assaut sir Roberte Barenguile
cosin to therle was slain. Thesame daie a .C. Archers on horseback
comyng out of Caleis, lawe and perceiued the dooynges &amp; demeanure
of therle and his compaignie, and toward night thei sent an Heraulte
certefiyng hym that the

                   would dine with hym the nexte daie: to whom
he proudly answered, that he would gladly receiue them, and their dinnar
should at their comyng be redy prepared. The nexte daie ensuyng
issued out of Caleis .CC. men of armes .CC. archers .CCC. mē on fote
with .x. or, xii. Chariottes laden with vitail and artillery, conducted by
sir Richard Astone knight, leuetenant of the Englishe pale for the erle
of Somerset capitain generall of those marches: whiche in good ordre
of battaill marched toward their enemies, whiche before by their espials
wer aduertised of their comyng, but that notwithstandyng thei issued
not out of their lodginges to encounter with them, but kept them
self within their closure. The Englishmen shot so sharply and so closly
together, that the Flemynges and fotemen began to flie, the men of armes
feryng the slaughter of their horses ran awaie with a light gallop
the Genowais whiche had spent the most part of their shot at thassaut
made litle defence and small resistence and so all were slain and put to
flight. The hasty &amp; rashe erle of sent Paul &amp; diuerse other without any
stroke geuen to their enemies fled to sent Omers, and there wer taken
of the best of the armie, as the Frenche and Duche Chronicle reporteth
thre or foure score persones, emongest whom the capitain of Bullayne
was one, and many lordes and kinghtes slain. After that the Englishmen
had taken all the cartes municions &amp; vitailes that their enemies
had brought thether, thei returned to Caleis in greate triumphe, and
within fiue daies after there issued out of the Englishe pale, about the
numbre of .v.C. men towarde Arde by night tyme, thynkyng to haue
found the toune vnprouided, but sir Mansard de Boys and the lorde
Kygnie defended it and let the Englishemen of their purpose, and so
with losse of fourty men thei returned to Caleis: whiche dedde persones
wer brent in an old hous, because their enimies should be ignorāte
of the damage that the Englishemen had by them sustained. Therle of
sent Paule beyng at Terwin, imaginyng how to recouer somewhat of
his losse but more of his honor, sente for a greate compaignie of noble
men and valiant personages, and cōcluded to inuade the Marches of
his enemies. But the Frenche kyng consideryng the erles euil fortune
and vnfortunate chance, cōmaūded hym to leue of his enterprise, with
whiche he was sore displeased. Yet to auoyd perelles the, Frenche kyng
laid in garrison at Bullein and other places, the Marques of Pownt
sonne to the duke of Barr, and therle of Dampnay, and sir Ihon Harpadane
a knight of greate renoune and high estimacion. The kyng of
England circūspectly forseyng thynges to come, and imagenyng that

the Frenchemen attempted some newe enterprice, against hym or his
dominions beyonde the sea, sente .iiii.M. men to Caleis and to the sea,
whereof .iii.M. landed at Sluce, whiche besi

their compaignie, but newes were brought to theim, that the duke of
Burgoyne had required licence of the Frenche kyng to besiege the
toune of Caleis, for whiche cause thei raised their siege, and returned
to the defence of that fortresse and desired praie of the Frenche nacion.

                  ABoute this season Loys Duke of Orliaunce brother to the
Frenche Kyng, a man of no lesse pryde then haute courage,
wrote letters to Kyng Henry aduertisyng hym, that he for
the perfighte loue whiche he bare to the noble feates of chiualrie
and marciall actes, in auoidyng the slowe worme and deadely
Dormouse called Idlenes, the ruine of realmes and confounder of nobilitie,
and for the obteignyng of laude and renoune by deades of armes
and manly enterprises, coulde imagine or inuent nothyng either
more honorable or laudable to them both, then to mete in the feld eche
parte with an hundred Knightes and Esquiers, all beyng Gentlemen
bothe of name and armes armed at al pointes and furnished with speares,
axes, swerdes and daggers, and there to fighte and combate to
the yeldyng, and euery person to whom God shal send victory to haue
his prisoner, and him to raunsome at his pleasure, offeryng hym selfe
with his company to come to his citie of Angulesme, so that the kyng
of England wolde come to the laundes of Burdeaux and there defend
this chalenge. The kyng of England whiche was as graue and wittie
as the duke was light and couragious, wrote to hym againe that
he not a littell mused but muche more meruailed that the duke beyng
sworne aswell to him as to kyng Richard to mainteyne the peace beetwene
his brother the Frenche kyng and theym concluded, and to that
had set his signe and great seale, wolde nowe for vainglory vnder colour
of doyng dedes of Armes not onely violate the peace and breake
the amitie betwene them before concluded, but also geue an occasion
of displeasure and ingratitude, by the whiche in conclusion might rise
mortall war and deadely enemitie, affirmyng farther that no kyng anointed
of very dutie was ether bound or obliged to answere any chalenge
but to his pere of egall estate and equiuolent dignitie, and that
no christian prince ether ought or shoulde consent to warre or effusion
of christen blud but onely for the defence of his realme, or for conquest
of his right, or for amplifiyng of Christes faithe and christian religion,
and not for pride, worldly 
                     •
                  ame and vainglory, declaryng also that
when oportunitie of time and conuenient leisure serued, he wold trans
                  
                     •
                  ret
and passe the sea himselfe with suche company as he thought most
conuenient into his countrey of Gascoigne, at whiche time the Duke
myght set forward with his band for the attainyng of honour and accomplishing

of his couragious desire and haute enterprise, promising
in the worde of a prince not thence to depart till the duke ether by fulfillyng
his owne desire, or by singuler combate betwene them two, onely
for auoidyng the effusion of Christen bloud, shoulde thinke himself
satisfied and fully answered. Howbeit, at that time he beyng enbusied
with weightie affaires &amp; vrgent causes concernyng the publike welth
of his realme could neyther apoint time nor place, protestyng that the
deferryng of time was nether for disdaine nor yet for cowardnes, but
only to abate the pride of him whiche knowyng not himself, nor fering
reproche, regarded not his othe writyng nor seale. To this answere the
duke of Orleaunce replied and kyng Henry reioyned, which doynges
what for the vnprincely tauntes and vncharitable checkes in them cō
                  teigned,
and what for rehersyng againe thinges to you here before declared
I omitte and put in obliuion. The duke of Orleaunce not content
with the king of England, assembled an armie of .vi.M. men and
entered into Guien and besieged the town of Uergy, wherof was Capitaine
sir Robart Antelfelde a valiant knight and an hardy captain,
hauyng with him onely thre hundred Englishmen. The duke almoste
euery day assaulted the towne fiersely, but they within the towne conragiously
defended the same: In so muche that when he had lien there
thre monethes &amp; had loste many of his men and nothyng gotten, without
honour or spoile returned into Fraunce. After this the Admiral of
Britayne whiche beyng highly elated and muche encouraged because
the laste yere he had taken certaine Englishe shippes laden with wine
accompanied with the Lord Castyll a valiant baron of Britaine, and
xii.C. men of armes, &amp; .xxx. shippes, sailed from sainct Malowes and
came before the towne of Darthmouthe and woulde haue landed, but
by the puissaunce of the townsmen and aide of the countrey, they were
repulsed and put backe in whiche conflicte the Lorde of Castell with
his two brethren with foure hundrede other were slain, and aboue two
hundred prisoners taken and raunsomed, wherof the Lord of Baqueuile
high Marshall of Britaine was one, whiche was brought to the
kyng and after redemed. The Admiral sory of this infortunate enterprise
with muche losse and no gain returned hastely into his countrey
Kyng Henry being aduertised of this attempt, sent the Lord Thomas
his sonne whiche after was duke of Clarence to the sea with a gret nauie
of shippes to the entent eyther with battaill or depopulacion of the
sea coastes bothe of Britaine and of Fraunce to reuenge this iniurie
and inuasion: he sailyng by the sea costes landed diuers times and fiered
shippes &amp; brent townes and destroied people without fauoure or
mercie, and when he thoughte his quarell well reuenged he sailed toward
England, and in his retournyng he encountred with two great
Carickes of Ieane laden with riche marchandise and substancial stuf
betwene whom was a greate conflicte and a blouddy battell, but after
long fightyng, the Englishemen preuailed and brought bothe the Carickes

into Camber before Rye, where one of them by misauenture of
fier perished to the losse and no gaine of bothe the parties. About this
this time Ihon duke of Burgoin whiche had long laboured and now
obteined licence to besiege the towne of Caleis, preparyng enginnes,
ladders, cartes, and all other instrumentes necessary and conuenient
for so great a feate and notorious siege, and assembled at S. Omers
vi.M. men of armes, xv.C. Crosbowes, beside .xii.M. fotemen, hauyng
vitail Bumbardes and other municions of warre sufficient and
conuenient for his abrode blowen enterprise. But when all thynges
wer prepared and the hole army assembled he was by the French kyng
and his councell (whiche put diffidence in the exploite of his glorious
busines) countermaunded &amp; prohibited farther to procede in that weightie
purpose: for the which cause he conceiued so great an hatred and
deadely malice against the Duke of Orleaunce (as the onely stop and
let of his glory and renoume) that he euer after not only maligned and
grudged against him and his procedynges, but also (as you shal shortly
heare) brought him to death and finall destruction.
            
            
               ¶The sixt yere.The .vi. yere.
               
               
                  IN this yere the Earle of Northumberland whiche bare still
a venemous scorpion in his cankered heart, and coulde not
desist to inuent and deuise waies and meanes howe to be reuenged
of kyng Henry and his fautours, began secretely to
communicate his interior imaginacions and priuie thoughtes with
Richard Scrope Archebishop of Yorke brother to Williā lord Scrop
treasorer of England whom kyng Henry (as you haue hearde) beheaded
at the towne of Bristow, and with Thomas Mowbrey erle Marshal
sonne to Thomas duke of Norffolke, for kyng Henries cause before
banished the realme of England, and with the lordes, Hastynges,
Fauconbridge, Bardolfe and diuerse other whiche he knewe to beare
deadely hate and inward grudge toward the kyng. After long consultacion
had, it was finally concluded and determined amongest theym
that al they, their frendes and alies with all their power shoulde mete
at Yorkes wold at a day appointed and that therle of Northumberlād
should be chefetaine and supreme gouernour of the armie, which promised
to bryng with him a great nomber of Scottes.
               
                  THIS sedicious conspiracy was not so secretely kept nor so closely
cloked but that the Kyng thereof had knowledge, and was fully aduertised.
Wherfore to preuent the time of their assembly, he with suche
power as he could sodainly gather together with al diligēce marched
toward the North parties and vsed such a celeritie in his iourney that
he was thither come with al his hoste and power before the confederates
hearde any inkelyng of his marchyng forward, and sodainly there
wer apprehended the Archebishop, the earle Marshal, sir Ihon Lampley,
and sir Robart Plumpton. These personnes wer arrained, atteinted

and adiudged to die, and so on the Monday 
                     •
                  n Whitson weke all
they withoute the Citie of Yorke were beheadded. Here of necessitie I
oughte not nor will not forgeate howe some folishe and fantasticall
personnes haue written, howe erronius Ipocrites and sedicious Asses
haue endited, howe supersticious Friers and malicious Monkes
haue declared and diuulged both contrary to goddes doctrine the honour
of their prince and common knowen veritie that at the howre of
the execuciō of this Bishop (which of the Execucioner desired to haue
fiue strokes in remembraunce of the fiue woundes of Christ) the kyng
at the same time sittyng at diner had .v. strokes in his necke by a person
inuisible, &amp; was incontinently strikē with a leprey, whiche is a manifest
lye as you shal after plainely perceiue. What shall a man say of
suche writers which toke vpon them to knowe the secretes of Goddes
iudgement? what shall men thinke of suche beastly persons whiche regardyng
not their bounden dutie and obeisance to their prince &amp; souerain
Lord enuied the punishment of traiters and torment of offēders?
But what shall all men coniecture of suche whiche fauouryng their
own worldly dignitie, their own priuate auctoritie, their own peculiar
profit, wil thus iuggle raile and imagine fantasies against their soueraigne
lord and Prince, and put theim in memorye as a miracle to his
dishonor and perpetual infamy: Wel let wise men iudge what I haue
said. Beside these persons, diuers other of thesaid conspiracie and facciō,
the lord Hastinges, the lord Fauconbridge, sir Ihon Coluile of the
dale, sir Ihon Griftith were beheaded at Durham. Therle of Northumberland
hearyng his councel to be reueled and his confederates to
be put to execucion and shameful death, fled into Scotland to his old
frend George of Dunbarre earle of the Marche, which the yere before
was renoked out of exile and restored to his possessions name and dignitie,
where he taried tyll the nexte Sōmer &amp; then sailed into Fraūce
and after into Flaunders desyryng aide and assistence againste kyng
Henry, but when he sawe littel hope of comfort and that fewe willyngly
were ententife to his request, he accompanied with the Lorde Bardolffe
muche dismaied and more desperate returned again to his trew
frendes into Scotlande and there made his abode the hole yere abydyng
the fauour of Fortune and chaunge of his vnfortunate chaunce
duryng whiche tyme the kyng withoute any difficultie toke into his
possession the towne of Barwicke, the castelles of Alnewyke and all other
Fortresses appertainyng to the Earle: and liyng at Berwycke he
caused to be put to deathe the Barons sonne of Greystocke, sir Henry
Beynton, and Ihon Blenkensoppe and fiue other as fautoures and
workers of this newe inuented conspiracy. When the kyng had thus
appeased and asswaged that late begonne commocion, he sent his son
the prince of Wales accompanied with Edward duke of Yorke and a
great puissance, to encounter with the Scottes which by promise wer
bound to ayde and assiste the confederates and rebelles. But thei hearyng

that the founders of the warre were apprehended and put to deathe,
made no haste f

                  ward but taried peacibly at home. So that the
prince entryng into Scotland and findyng no resistence, brent tounes
spoyled villages and wasted the countrey euery where as he passed,
whiche thyng so muche amased the kyng of Scottes and his councel,
that notwithstandyng that he had gathered and appoincted a greate
hoste vnder the conducte of the Erles of Douglas and Bowgham to
resist the prince and his inuasions, yet they sente Ambassadors to hym
requiryng hym of peace and finall concord, whiche requeste he vtterly
denaied, but at their humble peticion he graunted them a truce for certaie
monethes, of the whiche they were bothe glad and ioyouse, and so
the prince laden with pray and spoile retourned with great gain to his
father. While the prince thus infected the countrey of Scotlād on the
land, sir Robart Umfreuile vice Admirall of England vexed the coū
                  treys
of Fyffe and Loghdian on the sea coast, for he liyng in the Scottishe
sea .xiiii. daies and euery daie landed on the one side or the other

toke the town of Peples on their faire day and caused his men to mete
Clothe with their bowes: and with great gain retournyng to his shippes
brent the Galiet of Scotland with many other vessels, and sente
Clothe vitail and diuers Marchandises to euery towne in Northumberland,
settyng thereon no great price: Wherfore the Scottes called
him Robyn mendmarket. The kyng about this time was newely vnquieted
and perturbed, for notwithstandyng this fortunate successe
that he had obteigned in all his outward warres and interiour affayres,
yet some of his people bare suche a cankered hearte towarde hym
that to expell hym from his rule and dignitie they left no occasion vnsought
nor deuice vnattempted. For sodainly sprāge out a fame of an
vncertain auctour that king Richard was yet liuyng in Scotland, to
whiche fable suche credite was geuen that if prudente policie had not
forsene the sequele, it had kendeled a greatter flame then within short
space might haue well bene quenched or extincte.
            
            
               ¶The seuenth yere.The .vii. yere.
               
               
                  IN this sommer, the Pestilenciall plage so infected the Citie
of London and the countrei roūd about, that the king durst
not repaire thither nor yet nere to the confines of the same,
wherfore he departyng from the castel of Ledes, determined
to take ship at Quinboroughe in the Isle of Shepey, and to sail ouer
to Lye in Essex and so to Plasshey, there to passe his time til the plage
were seased: and because certain pyrates of Fraunce were lurkyng at
the Temmes mouthe waityng for their pray, Thomas Lord Camois
with certaine shippes of warre was appointed to wafte ouer the king.
When the kyng was on the see, in the middest of his iourney, whether

the wind turned, or that the Lord Camois kept not a directe course, or
that his shippe was but a slugge. The Frenchemen whiche by al similitude
had knowledge of the Kynges passage entered amongest the
kynges nauie and toke fowre vesselles nexte to the kynges shippe and
in one of thē sir Thomas Rampston knight the kinges vicechamberlain
with all his chamber stuffe and apparel, and folowed the kyng so
nere that if his shippe had nat bene swift he had landed soner in Frāce
then in Essex, but by goddes prouision and fortunate chaunce he escaped
the daunger and ariued at his appointed porte. The kyng beyng
sore moued with the lord Camois, caused him to be atta
                     •
                  hed and endited
that he condiscended and agreed with the Frenchemen that the
kyng in his iourney should be intercepted and taken. On this poinct
he was arraigned the last day of October before Edmond erle of Kent
that day high stuard of the realme, on which day were he giltie or giltles,
fautie or clere, culpable or innocent of that fact and doyng, he was
by his peres found not giltie and dismissed at the barre, hauyng restitucion
bothe of his landes goodes and offices. In this yere kyng
Henry not onely desiryng newe affinitie with forein princes but also
the preferment of his line and progeny, sent the Lady Phylip his yonger
doughter to Ericke kyng of Denmarke, Norwey and Swethen
whiche was conueighed thither with great pompe and there with muche
triumphe maried to the said kyng, where she tasted bothe welthe,
and wo, ioye &amp; pain. About this season died sir Robert Knolles knight
a man of great policie, wisdome and experience in war, which had bene
a Capitayn from the time of Kyng Edward the .iii. till his latter dayes,
in the whiche he beyng Gouernour of Aquitayne encombred with
age, resigned his office to sir Thomas Belfford a valiaunt capytaine
and retourned to London, where he disseased and was honorably buried
in the Churche of the White Fryers.
            
            
               ¶The eyght yere.The .viii. yere
               
               
                  YOu haue heard before how kyng Robert of Scotlande being
very aged and impotent, was not able to rule and gouerne
his realme, and how Walter his brother beeyng by
hym created duke of Albani
                     •
                  , (whiche was the firste duke
that euer was in Scotlande) was made gouernor of his
brothers countree and dominion. After whiche office and preheminēce
by hym obteigned, he so sore thirsted after the croune and scepter royal
that he cared litle though the kyng his brother, and his two sōnes had
been at Christes fote in heuen. And somwhat to further his purpose, it
vnfortunatly chaūsed that Dauy of Rothesay prince of the realme and
eldest sonne to the kyng, was accused to his father of diuerse heynous
crimes, and in especiall of lasciuious &amp; dissolute liuyng, as rauishyng
of wiues, deflouryng of virgins, and defilyng of maidens, wherfore
the kyng deliuered hym to his brother the gouernor, trustyng that by

his good counsaill and discrete aduertisemente he would not onely amend
his life, but also to fall to wisedom prudence and grauitie. Whē
the duke had possessed part of his desired pray, he sent his nephewe frō
castle to castle, from prisone to prisone, from place to place, and in conclusion
lodged him in a toure within the castle of Franckelande, where
with famyne he caused miserably to ende his life, puttyng a poore
woman to painfull death, whiche gaue to the Prince the milke of her
brestes by a rede into the prisone. His death was long hidden from the
king his father, but in conclusiō, the gouernor shewed to the king how
diuerse persones traiterously had murdred hym, whiche wer apprehended
and iudged to die, &amp; yet in their liues thei neuer knewe nor yet saw
hym. The kyng notwithstandyng his brothers excuse, doubted muche
thend of his other sonne named Iames, wherfore he priuely prouided
a ship, in the whiche he put the child beyng then of the age of .ix. yeres,
vnder the tuicion of the lorde Hēry Senclere erle of Orkeney, willyng
him to cōuey the prince into y• realme of Fraūce if by any possibilitie he
could thether attain. And if fortune should driue hym on ye cost of England,
he wrote letters to the kyng of England, y• tenor wherof insueth.
               
                  
                     ROBERT Kyng of Scottes,A letter sente by the Kyng of Scottes. sendeth gretyng to Kyng Henry of
Englande, although by relacion of other persones I haue knowen before
this tyme, what magnanimitie, what clemencie, and other infinite
vertues be planted and roted in your royall persone, yet in the voyage
that you your self personally last made into Scotlād, I haue had manifest
and open experience of thesame. For whē you like our enemy inuaded
our countrie, brent our tounes, and destroyed our people, yet by
the fauor that you shewed to suche places and people whiche receiued
and fostered your noble father when he fled out of Englād (for feare of
rebelles whiche then sore afflicted his lande) we haue receiued almoste
as muche profit and aduantage as we did hurte and damage, by your
terrible warres and bloudy inuasions. Wherefore I cannot but laud
and praise your highnes &amp; iudge your noble herte mete for a kyngdō,
but also I do loue and will not cease to loue you duryng my naturall
life. And notwithstandyng that realmes and nacions daily contende
and make warre for glory rule and empire, yet to vs bothe beyng kynges,
no suche occasion is geuen to do as thei do, or to folowe their steppes
or progression, but we (whiche is the duetie of a kyng) oughte to
striue who shall prosecute other with moste humain fauor and continual
clemencie, and as muche as we maie to be felowes, compaigniōs
and alies, in singuler loue and perpetual amitie. And as for suche causes
as now be different and in discencion betwene vs and our realmes
for my part I shall endeuor my self to bryng all thynges to a good cō
                     clusion
&amp; mutuall conformitie. And because that I now am in thesame
trouble and perplexitie for my children, that your father was with the
rebelles of Englande, I am compelled of very necessitie to desire aide
and seke cōforte of forain princes and strange nacions. And although
that by the help of God and power of my people, I am able inough to

kepe thesame against all outwarde powers and forain attemptes. Yet
from the secrete malice of suche as lurke and bee daily norished in my
very bosome, I cannot kepe theim in suertie within myne owne dominion.
And yet in no other place thei can bee from that pestiferous conspiracy
put in any sure defence or perfight sauegard, except thei be preserued
by the faith and fidelitie of good and iust men. The worlde this
tyme is so full of malice, so replenished with rancor, that wheresoeuer
that golde or siluer (whiche bee instrumentes of mischief) maie enter or
penetrate, there shalbe founde ministers prone and redy to do and perpetrate
al detestable crimes and mischeuous inuencions: But because
I knowe and perceiue your person to be endued with so many notable
vertues, and to be adorned with such Magnanimitie, fidelitie, iustice,
clemencie, and finally, not onely to be r
                        •
                     plenished with the whole compaignie
and felowship of the vertues Moral, but also to be of that power,
riches &amp; puyssance that no prince in our tyme, maie to your highnes
be ether compared or assimuled, I beyng by your noble and notable
qualities allected and encoraged, moste hertely require your helpe
and humbly desire your aide, relefe and comfort. For mine eldest sonne
Dauid, (as I suspect and as the fame rūneth, althoughe I cannot yet
thereof make a perfight proffe) is murthered, by no comen murther, by
no open thefe, by no notorious malefactor nor by no furious persone,
but by my brother his vncle whiche ought to haue protected and saued
him, to whom I cōmitted the gouernance of me, my children, my whole
realme and all that I had, whiche vnnaturall kinseman hath not only
killed my child, but hath shamefully slain and murdered hym with the
moste cruell and miserable kynd of death, which is famyne. And so he,
which ought &amp; whose duety was to haue aduoyded and put frō me the
iniuries of all other persones, hath afflicted me with the moste contumelie,
the greatest iniury and manifest damage, that euer subiecte did
attempt against his Prince, or brother against brother, or enemy against
kinseman. For he whom I made gouernor to withstand the power
and malice of mine outward enemies, compasseth and imagineth how
to destroy myne issue, and consequently myne owne persone. Wherfore
for the fauor that you bere to iustice sent by God to mankinde, and for
the naturall loue and fatherly affeccion that you bere to your children
and posteritie, I humbly require and hertely desire your magnificēce,
that this mine onely child, not onely maie safely and surely liue vnder
your defence &amp; proteccion, but also that you of your accustomed goodnes
will vouchsaue to preserue and defende this the onely heire of my
posteritie from the malicious attemptes of his cruell kynred and ambicious
consanguinitie. And this the rather, for the remembrance both
of your fathers chance, whiche in his necessitie found muche humanite
in our nacion, and also of the frailtie of worldly suretie, whiche assone
changeth from good to euill, and from euill to worse, as the faire and
redolēt flower this daie florisheth, and to morow widreth and sodainly
vadeth. Requiryng you to haue in remembraunce, that if princes put

their whole confidence only in their comon people, whiche be more variable
then the Wethercocke or Wynd, and haue no outward frendes
nor forain amitie, their empire is fallyng and their regiment very britell.
But if princes be coupled in the chaines of indissoluble amite, and
will mutually &amp; faithfully defende their comen enemies, and aduoyde
their manifest iniuries, there is no power or strength of the comen people,
that ether can hurte or cast theim from the throne: in suche a suertie
is a kyng that so is garnished with the loue, fauor and amitie of outward
princes and louyng neighbors. Wherfore, if it may seme expedient
to your high wisedome, to here this my lowly requeste and louyng
suete (whiche I thynke your clemencie wil not reiect nor refell) my desire
is, that accordyng to the last truce concluded betwene you and vs,
in the whiche is conteigned that all men conueighyng letters from the
one of vs to the other, should suerly &amp; sauely passe and repasse without
any cōtradicciō: That it would plese you not to breke nor deny thesaid
liberty to this berer our only sōne, but for your honor to kepe your promise
sincerly inuiolated &amp; faithfully obserued. And thus the gracious
God preserue your noble person in your royal estate long to continew.
               
               
                  VVHEN all thynges necessary were prepared, the mariners halsed
vp their ankers and departed from Bas castle with this young prince
and Henry Percie sonne to the lorde Percie slain before at Shrewesbury,
and by rigor of tempest wer driuen on the cost of Holdernes called
Flamborough hed the .xxx. daie of Marche, where the yong prince
for to refreshe hymself toke lande. He wroughte not so priuely, but he
was knowen and taken with all his cōpany, &amp; conueighed to the kyng
beyng at Windsore, where he with dew reuerēce deliuered his fathers
letter. Whē the letter was redde &amp; vnderstand, the kyng assembled his
counsail to knowe what should be doen with this noble enfant. Some
to whom the continual warres and daily battail was bothe displeasāt
and odious, affirmed that there could not happen a better or a more
surer occasion of peace and amitie betwene bothe the realmes, whiche
beyng so offred, thei would in no wise should be reiected but taken, consideryng
that this prince was sent thither, in trust of sauegard, in hope
of refuge, and in request of aide and comfort against his euill willers
and malicous enemies: other (whose opinion toke place) affirmed hym
to be a prisoner and so to bee ordered, for asmuche as he was taken the
warre beeyng open, and that his father did not onely maintayne
therle of Northumberland and other rebelles within his countrie and
geue them greate honors, but also sent a greate nombre of his nobilite
against the kyng at the battaill of Shrewesbery. Wherfore it was agreed
that he should be deteined as a prisoner, lawfully taken and duely
apprehēded. When tidynges of this difinitiue sentence was shewed
to his father, he tooke suche an inwarde conceit and so sore a penciffenes,
that he ended his naturall life within a fewe monethes after. Although
the takyng of this young prince, was at the first tyme displeasant
to the realme of Scotlande: yet surely, after he and all his region

had greate cause to reioyse and thanke God of their fortunate chaunce
and good lucke that insued. For where before that tyme the people of
Scotlande wer rude, rusticall, without any vrbanitie, hauyng litle lernyng
and lesse good maners, &amp; good qualities least of all. This prince
beeyng .xviij. yeres prisoner within this realme, was so instructed and
taught by his scholemasters &amp; pedagoges apointed to him by the onely
clemencie of the kyng, that he not onely florished in good learnyng
and freshe litterature (as the tyme then serued) but also excelled in all
poynctes of Marciall feates, Musicall instrumentes, Poeticall artes
and liherall sciences. In so muche that at his returne from captiuitee,
he furnished his realme bothe with good learnyng and ciuill policie,
whiche before was barbarous, sauage, rude &amp; without al good nurtur.
            
            
               ¶The nyneth yere.The .ix. yere.
               
               
                  THerle of Northumberland, whiche had been in Fraunce and
other regions to obteigne aide against kyng Henry, and had
misled of his purpose, now putte his whole confidence in the
Scottes, and in especiall in his olde frende George erle of
Marche, and so assembled a great power of the Sctotish nacion to inuade
Northumberland, and recouered diuerse of his owne castles and
seign
                     •
                  ories, to whom the people without nombre daily resorted. Wher
fore he entendyng to bee reuenged of his olde greues, accompaignied
with the lorde Bardolffe and diuerse other Scottes and Englishmen
entred into Yorke shire and there began to destroy and depopulate the
countrie. Wherof the kyng beyng aduertised, caused a greate army to
bee assembled and marched toward his enemies, but or the kyng came
to Notyngham, Raufe Rekesbie shrife of Yorke shire, in the middest of
February with the power of the countrie, sodainly set on therle and his
compargnie, at a place called Bramham More, where after long fightyng,
the erle and the Lorde Bardolffe and many other wer taken and
brought to Yo
                     •
                  ke and there executed, and their heddes sent to London.
               
                  AFTER this the kyng hauing knowledge that diuerse pirates wer
wanderyng on the cost of Englande, prepared a great armie furnished
with men, vitaile and municions of warre mete &amp; conuenient for suche
an enterprice, and in the beginnyng of Marche sent to the sea, lorde Edmond
Hollande erle of Kent, chieftain of that crewe and armie. When
the erle had searched all the coaste of Fraunce, and had founde not one
pirate or s
                     •
                  a robber, he was aduertised by his espials that thei heryng
of his armie, wer diuerted to the partes of Britayn. Wherfore the said
erle entendyng to be reuenged on them whiche he sought for, made his
course thether, before his arriual thei had conueighed their shippes in
to the hauens, so that he could not fight with them on the sea, wherfore
he launched out his botes and with his fierce souldiers toke land and
fiercely assaulted the towne of Briake standyng on the sea side. The
citiezens threwe out dar
                     •
                  es, cast stones, shotte quarelles and manfully
defended their walles. In whiche conflicte the earle receiued such a
wound in his head that he departed out of this world the .v. day after.

The assailantes not dismaied but set a fire with the death of their captaine
like men desperate styll assaulted the towne and by fine force entered
into the same and set it a fier and slewe all that would make any
resistence, and for lacke of a captain, the men of warre laden with praies
and prisoners returned againe into Englande.
               
                  THIS Edmond erle of Kent was in suche fauour with kyng Henry
that he not alonely aduaunced and promoted him to highe offices and
great preheminences, but also by his meane and no small coste obteigned
for him the eldest doughter and one of the heires of the Lord Barnabo
of Millaine brother to Lord Galeace whose sōne also called Galeace
murderyng his vncle Barnabo made himselfe first duke of Millaine,
for which mariage Lord Barnabo paied to him an hundred M.
Duccates at the churche of saint Marie Oueryes in Southwarke at
the day of the solempnite, by doen Alphōs de Caniola. This Lucie after
the death of her husband by whom she had no issue, was moued by
the kyng to mary with his bastard brother the Earle of Dorcet a man
very aged and il visaged, whose person nether satisfied her fantasy nor
whose face pleased her appetite, wherfore she preferring her own mind
more then the kynged desire, delityng in him the whiche shoulde more
satisfie her wanton pleasure then gaine her any profite, for very loue
toke to husband Henry Mortimer a goodly yong Esquier and a bewtifull
Bacheler. For which cause the kyng was not onely with her displeased
but also for mariyng withoute his licence he seassed and fined
her at a great some of money, whiche fine kyng Henry the .v. bothe released
and pardoned and also made him knyght and promoted hym to
great offices both in England and Normandie, whiche sir Henry had
issue by this Lady, Anne maried to sir Ihon Awbemond mother to Elizabeth
Chandos mother to Phillis maried to sir Dauie Halle capitayne
of Caen, she had also issue Mari maried to Ihon Cheddur and
Luce espoused to sir Ihon Cressy. This yere by reason of Frost, shepe
and birdes died without nomber, whiche continued fiftene weekes.

                  ABoute this time Ihon duke of Burgoine a man of a quicke
witte, desirous of rule, &amp; of an haute courage, being of great
auctoritie amongest the Frenche nacion to whome ciuill discorde
was more pleasure then faternall amirie and mutuall
concorde, began sore to grudge and maligne against Lewes Duke of
Orleance brother to the French kyng, because that he was chefe of the
kynges councell and ordered al thinges by his discrecion, because the
king his brother was (as you haue heard) fallen into a frensy and therfore
medled in nothyng. The duke of Orleance on the otherside beyng
highly set vp in pride, began to disdain and froune at the duke of Burgoin,
because he perceiued that he aspired 
                     •
                  gaped to haue the supreme
regimente in the publike affaires and weightie causes, thus the one
would haue no superior, and the other would haue no pere. This cancard
disdain in shorte space grewe to suche a hate, that all the realme of

France was deuided into two faccions, thone parte fauoryng the duke
of Orleance, and the other enclinyng to the duke of Burgoyne, whiche
deuision had almoste brought the realme of France to vtter ruine and
perpetuall confusion. The Frenche kyng beyng somwhat amended of
his dissease, heryng of this controuersie betwene these two princes, sēt
for theim bothe to Paris, where he reproued their pride, rebuked their
malice, and taunted their vngodly dooynges, in so muche that all the
nobilitie beyng present, iudged the displeasure to haue been bothe forgotten
and forgeuen. But high corages are not so sone abated, nor roted
malice is not in hast plucked vp, for the duke of Burgoyne still cō
                  passyng
the destruccion of the duke of Orleance, appoyncted a secrete
frende called Raffe of Actouille, to bryng his purpose to passe. This
Raffe forgettyng not his enterprise, assembled together a compaignie
of suche persons as he moste trusted, &amp; as a Wolffe gredy of his pray,
when the duke of Orleance was commyng from the court in the night
season, he fiersly set vpon hym and shamefully slewe hym. When this
murder was published, the king lamēted, the nobles grudged, and the
comon people cried to God for vengeance. The duke of Burgoyne iustified
this act by the mouth of Master Ihon Petit doctor in deuinite,
whiche wrested scripture and doctors so far out of course, that his iustificacion within fewe yeres after was adiudged heresy by the whole vniuersite
of Paris. The French kyng, lest that greater mischief should
ensue, was compelled to hide and cloke his inward affeccion and dolorus
herte and to dissimule the matter, doubtyng lest the duke of Burgoyne
whose herte and haute corage he had well knowen before, (if he
should proceade against hym for this euill acte) would ioyne and take
part with the Englishe nacion against the realme of France. Wherefore
after long consultacion had by the entreatie of the kyng and other
Princes of the bloud royall, Charles duke of Orleance sonne to duke
Lewes lately murdred, and Ihon duke of Burgoyne were reconsiled
and brought to a fained concord and a fainte agremente, eche of theim
takyng a corporall othe vpon the holy Euangelistes, neuer after to disagre
or renewe any displeasure for any thyng before passed. But what
preuaileth an othe where hertes still burne &amp; malice continually smoketh,
who careth for periury whē apetite of reuēgyng daily encreaseth.
               
                  IN this case was the duke of Orleance whiche perceiuyng the king
his vncle to beare with the duke of Burgoyne, and to let the detestable
murdre of his father so lightly passe without pain or punishmēt, alied
and confederated hymself with the dukes of Berry and Burbon, &amp; the
erles of Alaunson and Arminacke, whiche reised agreate puissance of
people, and defied the duke of Burgoin and his cōplices as their mortall
foo and dedly enemy. The duke of Burgoine feryng the sequele of
the matter (because ther was a maciō of mariage to be had betwene the
prince of Wales and his doughter) was somwhat the bolder to send to
the kyng of England for aide and succors against his enemies. Kyng
Henry no lesse forseyng then that whiche after ensued, whiche was that

the discord of these two great princes might turne his realme to profit
and honor, sent to the duke of Burgoine, Thomas erle of Arundell, sir
Gilbert Umfreuile lorde of Kyne, sir Robert Umfreuile, and sir Ihon
Grey with .xij.C. archers, whiche toke shippyng at Douer and landed
at Sluce. When thenglishmen wer ariued in Flaunders, the duke of
Burgoin with thenglishmen and all his power, rode daie and night til
he came nere to Paris, and ther the next daie after with hard fightyng
and coragious shotyng, the Englishmen gat the bridge of saint Clow,
whiche passed ouer the riuer of Saine, and toke and slewe all the souldiers
whiche the duke of Orleance had left there in garrison to defend
the bridge. Emongest whom sir Mansard de Boys a valiant capitain
was taken prisoner by the Englishemen &amp; highly raunsomed. But the
duke of Orleāce and his compainy whiche wer like to haue been compassed
with their enemies, so that almost al their waies of refuge were
stopped and enclosed, in the night tyme made a bridge ouer the riuer
on the part of saint Denis strete, &amp; so escaped &amp; fled into the highe coū
                  tries.
And after this conflicte the duke of Burgoyn beyng now in his
ruffe thinkyng no man ether in aucthorite or bloud equiuolente to his
person, and blinded with a kall of vainglory before his iyes, toke vpō
him the hole rule and gouernance of the realme and ordered the kyng
as pleased him, and not to the kinges wil, and thinkyng that in so trobelous
a season he had vnknit the knot of all ambiguities &amp; doubtes
perceiuyng al thynges to haue better succeded for his purpose then he
before imagined, dismissed Thenglishmen into their countrey geuing
to them harty thankes and great rewardes. Which doyng king Hēry
much disalowed, consideryng that he had sent away his defence before
the great brunt of the war wer ouerpassed, &amp; shuld haue taken hede before
what policie his enemies had practised or what puissance thei had

and set furth their owne persons, finances and lādes to serue the kyng
of England his heires and successors, when souer thei wer required or
called in all iust quarelles: whiche iust quarelles the kyng of Englāde
shall take to aperteigne to the duchie of Guyen with the appurtenances,
affirinyng how thesaid duchie perteigneth and ought to apertain
to hym of righte by lineall heritage and lawfull successyon, manifestyng
from thence furthe, that thei should not blemishe nor spotte their

rightes and quarels, so that the bonde of their allegiance might be saued,
the which in another secrete apointement they before had declared.
               
                  ALSO thei offred to the kyng of England generally al their frendes
adherentes alies and wel willers to serue him in his quarel for the recouery
of the hole Duchie of Guien.
               
                  ALSO to cease al fraude, the sayd lordes recognised that they were
ready, to affirme the saied Duchie of Guien to belong to the kyng of
England, in like and semblable wise in liberty and franchises, as euer
any of the said kynges predecessors held or possessed the same.
               
                  ALSO the said lordes knowledged that al the townes castels and
fortresses that they had within the Duchie of Guien, to holde them of

seruice and homages after the best maner that in suche case might be.

to the regarde of other townes and fortresses whiche were not in their

their propre charges and expences.
               
                  ALSO the kyng of England was agreed that the duke of Berry his

his life onely, and the countie of Perrigot for euer, and the Erle
of Arminacke to holde .iiii. castels vpon certain sureties and condicions
as by indenture should be appointed.
               
                  FOR the which offers couenauntes and agrementes they affirmed
that the kyng of England as Duke of Guien, ought to defende &amp; succour
them against all men as their very Lord and soueraigne, and not
to conclude any treatie of leage with the Duke of Burgoine, his brethren,
children, frendes or alies.
               
                  FVRTHERMORE, the kyng of England ought to ayde the sayd
Lordes as his trewe vassals in all their iuste quarels for recoueryng
of damages for iniuries to them wrongfully done.
               
                  ALSO they required the kyng of England to send to thē .viii. thousand
men to ayde them againste the Duke of Burgoine, whiche daily
prouoked the French kyng to make open warre on them, their landes
and seigniories, promisyng farther to dis

                  KYNG Henry louingly receiued &amp; gentely entertayned this messenger
Alberte, and when he had well debated and considered the
case, he first detesting the abhominable murder of the late duke of Orliaunce
and seyng no Iustice ministred nor no punishment done for so
shamefull an acte, hauyng also approued experience that the Duke of
Burgoine wolde kepe no longer promise then he him selfe listed. And
secondarily consideryng what large offers these Princes had made to
him bothe greatly to his honour and to the high profit and commoditie
of his realme and subiectes, thought that he was bounde by the office
of a kyng to ayde and succour theym whiche cried for Iustice and
could haue none, and in especiall because they in that point beyng his
subiectes and vassalles ought to be defended in maintenaunce of his
superioritie and seigniorie: wherfore he louyngly promysed them aide
and relefe. This returne of the messenger was to them as pleasant as
is the deliuerance of a captiue frō his sore imprisonment, or of a marchant
passyng by the way beset about by Theues, beyng reskewed by
his frendes or cōpanions. And not without cause, for the French king
not of his own courage animated, but maliciously encēsed by the duke
of Burgoyn, persecuted the faction of the Orliaunces from citie to citie
from towne to towne, with such power and extremitie that thei wer
bothe of force and necessitie compelled to repaire to the Citie of Bourges
in Berry, and there to appoincte theym selfes

but it was apparantly espied in Fraunce, wherefore the French
kynges counsail sent the Earle of S. Paule the olde cankered enemy
to the Englishmen into the parties of Picardy with fiften C. horsemē
and a great nomber of fotemen, he ordeined certain of his men to geue
assaulte to the toune of Guisnes while he stode in a stale to lie in waite
for the relefe that myght come from Caleis. The furious Frenchmen
brake a fewe old pales about pore mens gardeins of Guisnes, but the
men of warre of the Castell shotte so fiercely at them with arowes and
caste oute wildefier in suche abundance that the assailantes were faine
to retire. And so the erle of sainct Paule whiche neuer wonne gain but
lost honor at the Englishe mens handes, returned not onely with losse

of Saincte Quintins.

                  THe Frenche kyng in the meane seasō by the enticement of the
duke of Burgoine layd sege to the citie of Bourges in Berry
where the duke of Orleance and his confederates had included
and fortified thēselfes. When the Kyng of England
was therof aducrtised, he with al diligence sent forthe his sonne Thomas
duke of Clarence, and Edward duke of Yorke with .viii.C. horsmen
and .ix. thousand archers whiche toke land in the bay of Hogges
in Normandy by sainct Waste in the territory of Constantine. Thenglishemen
swarmed like Bees rounde aboute the countrey, robbyng
Marchantes, spoilyng husbandmen and brennyng townes, and were
ioyously receiued of the Erles of Alaūson and Richmond fautors of
the Orliencial part. The councel of Fraunce not willing that the Englishmen
should ioyne or concurre with the Dukes of Orleaunce and
Berry or their complices, caused a common fame (although it wer not
trewe) to be diuulged abrode that there was a finall peace and a perfit
amitie concluded betwene the Frenche kyng &amp; his lordes whiche lately
were to hym aduersaries. When this fable was notified to the Englishmen
whiche were by hasty iourneis passed the ryuer of Leire, the
                     •
                  
spoiled the towne and Monastery of Beauliew, and wasted with fire
and swerde the countreis of Touraine and Maine. Against whom the
duke of Burgoyn sent the lord of Rambures with a great armie, whiche
in short time was before vanquished. The Dolphyn of Fraunce fearyng
the doynges of the Englishemen concluded a fayned peace betwene
the dukes of Orleaunce and burgoyne and their adherentes, so
that the duke of Orleaunce should without delay dispatche out of the
dominions of Fraunce all the English armie. The duke was not rich
to paie, and the Englishmen were gredy to haue, in so muche that thei
marchyng toward Guien in good order what by sackyng of townes &amp;
what with raunsomyng of riche persones, gat great treasure and many
good prayes. Beside this to the aide of the duke of Orliaunce king

Henry sent to Caleis therles of Kent and Warwike with .ii. thousand
fightyng men whiche spoiled &amp; defaced the countie of Bullenois, and
brent the towne of Samer de Boys and toke with assault the fortresse
of Russalte with diuers other. The duke of Orleance which was daily
called on to dispatche the Englishemen out of Fraunce, came to the
duke of Clarence and his army rendryng to thē a M. gramercies and
disoursed to them as muche money as ether he or his frendes myghte
easily spare: and for two hundred and .ix.M. Frankes whiche remayned
vnpaide he deliuered in gage his second brother Ihon erle of Angules

whiche was Grandfather to Frances afterward French king
and sir Marcell of Bourge, sir Ihon of Samoures, sir Archibault of
Uiliers and diuers other, whiche earle long continewed in Englande
as you shall perceiue hereafter. When this agrement was taken, the
dukes of Clarence and Yorke with gret pray (riche prisoners, and welthy
hostages) came to Burdeaux makyng warre on the frontiers of
Fraunce, to their greate gaine and profitable lucre. So by the onely

of Burgoyne: But also fell in suche fauour with the kyng &amp; the realm
that he was of al men welbeloued, muche honored and highly estemed,
and so continewed till waueryng Fortune turned her variable whele.
For after this he beyng enemy to the Englishe nacion was vāquished

declared and shewed that honors ought to change maners, for
incontinent after that he was stalled in the siege royall, and had receiued

that he might shewe hymself a synguler mirror and manifest example
of moral vertues and good qualities to his comen people and

               dicions
of the people, and vigilantly to forsee and daily study how to
acquire to hymself laude and glory, and to other profite and comodite,
and not to delight in worldly pleasures whiche are commen emongest
the lowest sorte of the vile and rusticall people. And he that will do nothyng
nor can do nothyng is more worthy to be called a seruant then a
ruler, &amp; a subiect rather then a gouernor. For what can bee more shame
or reproche to a prince, then he whiche ought to gouerne and rule other
shall by cowardnes, slouth and ignorance as a pupille not of .viij. or .x
yeres of age, but beyng of .xx or .xxx. yeres and more, shalbe compelled
to obey and folowe the willes of other, and be ruled and beare no rule,
like a ward and not like a gardē, like a seruant and not like a Master.
Suche a gouernor was kyng Richarde the seconde, whiche of hymself
beeyng not of the moste euill disposicion, was not of so symple a
minde, nor of suche debilite of witte, nor yet of so litle herte and corage,
but he might haue demaunded and learned good and profitable counsaill,
and after aduise taken, kept, retayned and folowed thesame: But
howsoeuer it was, vnprofitable counsailers wer his confusion and finall
perdicion. Suche another ruler was kyng Edwarde the seconde,
whiche two before named kynges fell from the high glory of fortunes
whele to exstreme misery and miserable calamitee. By whose infortunate
chance (as I thynke) this kyng Henry beyng admonished, expulsed

from hym his old plaie felowes, his preuie Sicophantes and vngracious
gard as authors and procurers of al mischifes and riot, and
assigned into their places men of grauitee, persones of actiuitee, and
counsaillers of greate witte and pollicie.
            
               AFTER that he had laied this prudent and polletique foundacion,
he entendyng in his mynd to do many noble and notable actes, and remembryng
that all goodnes cometh of God, and that al worldly thynges
and humain Actes bee more weaker and poorer then the celestiall
powers &amp; heuenly rewardes, determined to begin with some thyng
pleasaunt and acceptable to God. Wherefore he first commaunded the
Clergie syncerely and truly to preache the worde of God and to liue after
thesame, so that thei to the temporaltee might be the Lanternes of
light and mirrors of vertue. The laie men he willed to serue God and
obey their prince, prohibityng to them aboue al thynges breche of matrimony
vse of sweryng &amp; wilful periury, exhortyng bothe to loue toge
ther as man with wife or brother with brother. Beside this he elected
the best learned men in the lawes of the realme to the officies of iustice,
and men of good liuyng he preferred to high degrees and authoritee.
            
               THE madnes of the Welshemen and Scottes (whose often incursions
and robberies he wel had in his fathers daies experimented and
assaied) he studied to assuage and represse, to the intent that he beeyng
quiet in his owne regions, might ether make outward warre without
doubte or dangier, or els for the commen wealth of his realme to study
how to encreace the glory of his seigniory, &amp; so both kepe &amp; conserue it.
            
               VVHEN all thynges were thus settled and framed to his purpose,
he caused the body of kyng Richard the second 
                  〈◊〉
                remoued with all
funerall pompes conueniente for his estate, from Langeley to Westminster,
where he was honorably enterred with Quene Anne his firste
wife in a solempne toumbe erected and set vp at the costes and charges
of this noble prince kyng Henry.
            
               ALTHOVGH this prudente prince and this pollitique gouernor
had set and established all thynges beyng in difference and variaunce
within his owne peculier realmes, countrees and territories and confines
of thesame: yet he nothyng lesse forgettyng nor no one thyng more
myndyng or desiring, then the ceassyng of the long scisme and deuision
sprong &amp; continued in the catholike church of Christian religion by the
moste ambicious desire and auaricious appetite of certain persones
callyng themselfes spirituall fathers, but in deede carnall coueteours
and gredy glottōs aspiryng for honor and not for vertue to the proud
see of Rome, desiryng more to pille then to profite Christes flocke or
Christian religion, hauyng knowledge that a generall counsaill was
somoned to bee celebrate and kept at the faire citee of Constance vpon
the riuer of Ryne, though that it was not his honor nor yet his ductie,
beyng thereof warned by the Emperor Sigismond to bee as a hearer
and no partaker in so high a cause, and in especiall in so high an assemble.

Wherefore he sent thether Richard erle of War
                  ••
               ke and three bishoppes
with other famous prelates and doctors, besides knightes &amp;
esquires to the numbre of eight hundred horsses. Thei wer men so well
appareled and their horsses so richely trapped, and all the compaignie
so well furnished, that the Almaines wondred, the Italians gased, and
all other nacions were astonnied to se suche an honorable compaignie
come from a countree so farre distant. At this Sinody were assembled
(as one authore writeth) CCC.xlvj. bishoppes, Abbottes and doctors
v.C.lxiiij: noble men, knightes and esquires .xvj.M. beside seruantes
whiche (not accomptyng the townes men) wer numbred .lxv.M. persones.
These Ambassadours were highly receiued of the Emperor Sygismond
and of the Romishe bishop called Ihon the .xxiij. whiche in
thesame counsaill for greate and abhominable crimes and detestable
offenses by hym perpetrated and comitted (of the whiche he could not
pourge hymself nor make any defence) was by thesame Sinody accordyng
to his demerites put doune and of his estate depriued. Gregory
the .xij. was one of the Scismatical numbre, fearyng shame more then
regardyng his worldly affeccion did putte doune hymself of his owne
propre mocion from his foolishe vsurped name and Popishe dignitee.
But Benedict the .xiii. still and stifly affirmyng hymself to be the very
Uiker of God, so muche desired honor, and so muche was wrapped in
his owne folishe and fantastical opinion, that no frend could persuade
hym, nor argumēt entice hym, nor no reason refrain hym from thesame,
and so accordyng to his desert by open iudgement, against his wil, lost
bothe name and honestie. And thre yeres after Otho Columbe a noble
Romaine borne was elected to the bishopricke of Rome and named
Martyne the fifth.
            
               IN this coūsaill Ihon Wicliffe borne in England, and Ihon Husse
and Iherom of Prage wer condēned to death. Duryng this firste yere,
sir Ihon Old Castle, whiche by his wife was called lorde Cobham, a
valiant capitain and an hardy gentleman, was accused to the Archbishop
of Cauntorbury of certain poynctes of heresy. Whiche bishoppe
knowyng hym to be highly in the kynges fauor, declared to his highnes
the whole accusaciō. The kyng first hauyng compassion of the noble
man, required the prelates that if he were a straied shepe, rather by
gentlenes then by rigoure to reduce hym to his olde flocke. After that
he sendyng for hym, godly exhorted and louyngly admonished hym to
reconcile hymself to God and his lawes. The lorde Cobham not onely
thanked the kyng of his moste fauorable clemencye, but also declared
firste to hym by mouthe and afterwarde by writyng the foundacion of
his faith, the ground of his belefe and the botome of his stomacke, affirmyng
his grace to be his supreme hed and competent iudge &amp; none
other persone, offeryng an hundred knightes and esquires to come to
his purgaciō, or els to fight in opē listes with his accusors. The kyng
not onely knowyng the lawes of the reame, but also persuaded by his

counsaill, that hereticall accusacions ought to be tried by the spiritual
prelates, sente hym to the tower of London there to abide the determinacion
of the clergie accordyng to the statutes in and for that cace prouided.
After whiche tyme the .xxiij. daie of Septembre, a solempne session
was appoincted in the Cathedrall churche of sainct Paule, and another
the .xxv. da of the said moneth in the hal of the Friers prechers
in London, in whiche places thesaid lorde was examined, apposed and
fully heard, &amp; in conclusion by the Archbishop denounced an hereticke
and so remitted again to the toure of London: Frō whiche place, ether
by help of frendes or corrupcion of kepers, he priuely escaped and cam
into Wales, where he temained by the space of thre yeres and more.
            
               AFTER this tyme in a certain vnlawfull assemble was taken sir
Robert Acton knight, a man of greate wit &amp; possessions, Ihon Broune
Esquire, Ihon Beuerley clerke and a greate numbre of other whiche
were brought to the kynges presence, and to hym declared the cause of
their commocion and risyng: and accusyng a greate nūbre of their sort
and societie (whiche cōfessiō because. I haue not seen, I leaue at large.)
After this folishe acte, so many persones were apprehended that all the
prisons in and aboute London wer replenished with people. The chief
of thein whiche wer .xxix. wer condempned by the clergie of heresy, and
attainted of high treason as mouers of warre against their kyng by
the temporal lawe in the Guyld hall the .xij. daie of December, and adiudged
for treason to be drawen and hanged, and for heresy to be consumed
with fire galowes and all: Whiche iudgemente was executed in
Ianiuer folowyng on thesaied Robert Acton and the .xxviij. other
            
               SOME saie that the occasion of their death was the conueighance
of the Lorde Cobham out of prisone. Other write that it was bothe for
treason and heresy as the record declareth. Certain affirme that it was
for feined causes surmised by the spiritualtie more of displeasour then
truth: the iudgement wherof I leaue to men indifferent. For surely all
coniectures be not true, nor all writynges are not the Gospell, &amp; therefore
because I was nether a witnes of the facte, nor present at the deede
I ouerpasse that matter and begin another.
            
               ¶The seconde yere.The .ii. yere.
               
               
                  KYng Henry cōtinually studiyng for the honor of hymself
and aduancement of his people, called his high courte of
parliament the last daie of April in the toune of Leicester
In the whiche parliamente many profitable lawes were
concluded: and many peticions moued wer for that tyme
deferred. Emongest whiche requestes, one was, that a bill exhibited in
the parliamente holden at Westminster in the .xj. yere of kyng Henry
the fourth (whiche by reason that the kyng was then vexed and troubled
with ciuill deuision &amp; domesticall dissencion, came to none effect)
might now bee well studied, pondered, regarded and brought to some

good conclusion. The effect of whiche supplicacion was, that the temporall
landes deuoutely geuen, and disordinatly spēt by religious and
other spirituall persones, might suffise to maintein to the honor of the
kyng and defence of the realme, xv. erles, xv.C. knightes .vj.M.ii.C.
esquites, and .C. almole houses for relief onely of the poore impotente
and nedy persones, and the kyng to haue clerely to his cofers twentie
thousande poundes, with many other prouilions and valewes of religioushouses
whiche I ouerpasse.
               
                  THIS before remembred bill was muche noted and feared emōgest
the religious fort whom in effect it muche touched, insomuche that the
fat Ab
                     •
                  otes swet, the proude Priors frouned, the poore Friers cursled
the sely Nonnes wept, and al together wer nothyng pleased nor yet cō
                  tent.
Now to finde a remedy for a mischief and a rent to stop a wounde,
the Clergy myndyng rather to bowe then breake, agreed to offre to the
kyng a greate some of money to staye this newe moued demaund. The
cause of this offre semed to some of the wise prelates nether decente nor
conuenient, for thei well forsawe and perfightly knewe that if the commōs
perceiued that thei by reward or offre of money would resist their
request &amp; peticion, that thei stirred &amp; moued with a fury wold not onely
rayle and despise theim as corruptours of Princes and enemies of the
publique wealthe, but would so crye and call on the kyng and his temporall
lordes that thei were like to lese bothe worke and oyle, cost and
linyng: Wherfore thei determined to cast all chaunces whiche mighte
serue their purpose, &amp; in especiall to replenishe the kynges brayne with
some pleasante study that he should nether phantasy nor regard the serious
peticion of the importunate commons.
               
                  VVHERFORE on a daie when the kyng was present in the parliament,
Henry Chicheley Archebishop of Caūtorbury therto newly preferted,
whiche beforetime had been a Monke of the Carthusians, a mā
whiche had professed wilfull pouertie in religion, and yet commyng abrode
muche desired honor, &amp; a man muche regardyng Godes law, but
more louyng his owne lucre. After lowe obeysaunce made to the kyng
he said after this maner in effect. Whē Iconsider our most entierly beloued
and lesse drad soueraigne lorde and naturall Prince,The o

                     hicheley Archebishoppe of 
                        •
                     auntortrry the louyng
mynd, the daily labor and continuall study whiche you incessantly implore
bothe for thaduancemēt of the honor of your realme and also profite
of your people: I cannot nor ought nor, except I would bee noted
not onely ingrate to your royall person beyng my patrone &amp; preferrer,
but also a neglecter of my dutye, a secrete mummer of suche thynges
whiche touche both the inheritance of your croune &amp; the honor of your
realme ether holde my peace or kepe silence. For all authors agree that
the glory of kynges consisteth not onely in high bloud and haute progeny,
not in haboundant riches and superfluous substaunce, nor in plesant
pastyme and ioyous solace: But the very tipe of the magnificence
of a prince resteth in populous riche regions, subiectes and beautifull

citees and tounes, of the whiche thanked be God, although you be cō
                  ueniently
furnished both within your realmes of England &amp; Ireland
and principalite of Wales, yet by lineal discēt, by progeny of blud and
by very inheritance, not onely the duchy of Normandy and Aquitaine
with the counties of Aniowe and Mayne and the countrei of Gascoyn
are to you as true and vndubitate heir of the same laufully deuoluted
and lineally discended from the high and most noble prince of famous
memory kyng Edward the third your great grandfather, but also the
whole realme of Fraunce with all his prerogatiues and preheminences,
to you as heire to your great grandfather is of ryght belongyng
and apperteignyng. In whiche realme, to reherse what noble persons,
what beautifull cities, what fertile regions, what substancial marchā
                  tes,
and what plentifull riuers are conteigned and included, I assure
you that time should rather faile then matter shoulde wax skant. The
fraudulent Frenchmen to defraude and take away your ryght and title
to the realme of Fraunce, in the time of your noble progenitor king
Edward the third, alledged a lawe, vntruly fained, falcely glosed and
Sophistically expounded, whereof the very wordes are these, In terram

                        •
                     alicam mulieres ne succedant, which is to say, let not women succede in the
landThe lande Salique. Salique. This land Salicque the deceitful glosers name to be
the realme of Fraunce. This lawe the Logicall interpretours assigne
to directe the croune and regalitie of the same region, as who wold say
that to that preheminence no woman were hable to aspire, nor no heire
Female was worthy to inherite. The French writers affirm that Pharamond
kyng of the Frenche Gaules, first instituted this lawe, which
neuer was, should or might be broken. See nowe howe an euell glose
confoundeth the text, and a perciall interpretour marreth the sentence,
for first it is apparantly knowen and by an hūdred writers confirmed
that Pharamond whom they alledge to be aucthour of this lawe was
duke of Franconia in Germany, and elected to be kyng of the Sicamb
                     •
                  es,
whiche callyng them selfes Frenchmen had gotten a parte of the
Gaule Celtike betwene the riuers of Marne and Seyn. This Pharamond
disceased in the yere of our Lord .iiii.C. &amp;, xxvi. long after whose
death, Charles the great beyng Emperoure and many yeres makyng
warre on the Saxons dyd in bluddy battaile disperse and confounde
the whole puissaunce of that nacion in the yere of our Lord viii.C and
fiue, and broughte theim to the catholique faith and christian conformitie.
After whiche victory certaine souldiers as the Frenche Cronographiers
affirm, passed ouer the water of Sala and there inhabited,
betwene the riuers of Elue and Sala, and wer commonly called Sali
Frenchemen or Sali Gaules, whiche countrey nowe is the lande of
Mismie. This people had suche displeasure at the vnhonest fashions
of the Germain women, that they made a law that the Females shuld
not succede to any inheritance within that land.
               
                  NOVVE with indifferent eares if you wyll note these two pointes

you shall casily perceiue that the lawe Salicque was only fained and
inuented to put your noble progenitours and you from your lawfull
ryght and true inheritaunce. For they saie that Pharamond made the
lawe for the land Salicque, whiche the glose calleth Fraunce. Then I
demaunde of master Gloser or rather master Doctor commenter, yf I
may call a commenter an open lier, whether Pharamond whiche died
iiii.C.xxi. yeres before the Frenchemen possessed the Gaule Salicque
and neuer sawe or knewe it, made a lawe of that thyng whiche at that
tyme was not his nor inhabited by his people. Beside this, the realme
of Fraunce whiche is your patrimony is compact of .iii. Gaules, Belgique,
Celtique and Aquitain, and no part of Salicque: then may the
gloser expounde aswell that Gaule Belgique is the countrey of Bryttam,
as to glose that the lande Salicque is the whole realme and dominion
of the croune of Fraunce. Wonder it is to see how the Frenchmen
Iuggle with this phantasticall lawe, folowyng the crafty hasarders
which vie a plai called seest thou me or seest thou me not. For whē
Kyng Pepyn whiche was Duke of Brabante by his mother Begga,
and Master of the palayce of Fraunce coueted the croune and scepter
of the realme, the Frenche nacion not remēbryng this infringible law,
deposed Childeryck the .iii. the very heyre male and vndoubted childe
of the line of Pharamond and Clouis kynges of Fraunce by the coū
                  sail
of 
                     •
                  achary then Bishop of Rome, and set vp in trone this Pepyn
as nexte heire generall discended of lady Blithyld doughter to kyng
Clothayre the first. Hugh Capet also whiche vsurped the croune with
out right or reason on Charles duke of Lorayne the sole heire male of
the line and stocke of Charles the greate, after that he had shamefully
murthered and in pitifull prison by the procurement of the Bishop of
Orleaunce destroied the said Charles, to make his title seme true and
apere good, where in dede it was bothe euell and vntrue, to blynd the
opinions of the common people and to set a glasse before their eies, cō
                  ueighed
him selfe as heire to the lady Lyngard doughter to the kyng
Charlemaine sonne to Lewes the Emperor which was sonne to Charles
the great kyng of Fraunce. Kyng Lewes also the ninth whome the
Frenchmen call Sainct Lewes beyng very heire to the saied vsurper
Hugh Capet, coulde neuer be satisfied in his conscience how he might
iustely kepe and possesse the croune &amp; regalitie of the realme of Fraūce
tyll he was perswaded and fully instructed that Quene Isabell his
graundmother was lineally discended of Lady Ermengard daughter
and heire to the aboue named Charles duke of Lorayn, by the foresaid
Hugh Capet of life and realme wrongfully depriued: by the which mariage
the bludde and line of kyng Charles the great was againe vnitedland
restored to the Croune and Scepter of Fraunce, so that it more
clearer then the sonne, openly appeareth the title of Kyng Pepyn, the
claime of Hugh Capet, the possession of kyng Lewes, ye and of all the
French kynges to this day, are deriued, claymed and conueighed from

the heire Female, and yet they would barre you as though your great
graundmother had bene no woman nor heire female, but a painted Image
or famed shadowe. If so many examples, if suche copie of presydentes
collected out of your owne histories and gathered oute of your
owne writers suffice not to confounde your simple Salicque lawe
inuented by falce fablers and crafty imaginers of you fablyng Frēch
menne, then here what God saieth in the booke of Numeri. When a
man dieth withoute a sonne, let the inheritance discend to the daughter:
If your princes call them selfes most Christian kynges, let theim
folowe the lawe of God before the lawe of the Painym Pharamond.
               Are not all lawes discrepant from Goddes lawes euel, and to al Christen
eares odious and noisome? Are Frenche women dyscended of the
blud roial no Christians, and not worthye to inherite in the realme of
Fraunce? Is the realme of Fraunce more noble then the kyngdome
of Iuda of whom Christ discended by a woman? When God sayed to
Abraham that in one of his sede al nacions shuld be blessed, how came
Christ of the seede of Abraham but onely by that immaculate Uirgin
his glorious mother? Likewise, when the Prophet Michee said, thou
tribe of Iuda art not the leaste of estimacion emongest the Princes of
Iuda, for oute of the shall come a capitayne whiche shall rule and direct
my people of Israel. Howe discended Christ from the rote of Iesse,
and howe was he duke and capitain of the Israelites, and how discended
he of the line of Dauid: But onely by his mother a pure virgin
and a maried wife. Beholde, by goddes lawe, women shal inherite
Behold in Fraunce, Frenchemen haue inherited by the onely line of
the women, and yet Englishmen be prohibite to clayme by the heyre
Female contrary to the lawe of God and man. Wherfore regarde wel
my soueraigne Lord your iust and true title to the realme of France,
by Goddes lawe and mannes lawe to you lawfully diuoluted as very
heire to Quene Isa

Wherfore auaunce forth your banner, fight for your ryghte, conquere
your inheritaunce, spare not swerde blud or fire, your warre is iuste,
your cause is good, and your claim true: and therfore couragiously set
forward your warre against your enemies. And to the entent that we
your louyng chapleins and obedient lubiectes of the spiritualtie wold
shewe our selfes willyng and desiryng to aide you for the recouery of
your auncient right and true title to the croune of France, we haue in
our spirituall conuocacion graunted to your highnes suche a some of
money as neuer by no spiritual persons was to any prince before your

his prepared purpose, Raulfe Erle of Westmerland, a man of no
lesse grauitie then experience, and of no more experience then stomack,
whiche was then high Warden of the marches toward Scotland, and
therfore thinkyng that yf the king shuld passe ouer into Fraunce with
his whole puissaunce, that his powre should be to weake to withstand

Wherfore he rose vp, &amp; making his obeysance to the kyng sayd.
               
                  SVRELY sir,The Oraciō of Raufe erle of Westmerland. as my lord of Canterbury hath clerkely declared, the
conquest of Fraunce is very honorable, and when it is gotten and obteigned
very profitable and pleasant: But sauyng your graces reformacion,
I say and affirme that to conquere Scotland is more necessary,
more apparante easie, and more profitable to this realme then is
the gaine of Fraunce. For althoughe I am not so well learned as my
lord Archbishop is, nor haue not proceded to degre in the Uniuersitie,
yet I haue red, and heard great clarckes say, that strengthe knitte and
combined together is of more force and efficacie then when it is seuered
and dispersed. As for an example, sprinkle a vessell of water and it
moisteth not, but cast it out wholy together and it bothe washeth and
norisheth. This notable saiyng before this time hath encoraged Emperors,
animated kynges and allured princes to conquere realmes to
them adioynyng, to vanquishe nacions to their dominions adiacent,
to subdewe people either necessary for their purpose, or beyng to them
daily enemies or continuall aduersaries. For profe whereof, beholde
what was the chefe cause and occasion why rulers and gouernours so
sore laboured, thirsted and coueted to bryng al regions to them adioinyng
into one rule or Monarchy? Was it not done to this entent that
the conquerors might haue the only power &amp; entier gubernacion of all
the landes and people within their climate, and gouerne thē in time of
peace and also haue their aide in time of war? Which monarchie was
of that maiestie and estimacion in the world, that no otherforein prince
or exterior potentate ether had audacitie or was able to attempte any
thyng within the territory or region of the monarchial prince and adourned
kyng. Let the kyngdome of the assiriens be your example, and
if that suffise not, then loke on the Percians, after on the Grekes and
lastly on the Romaines, whiche euer desired and coue
                     •
                  ed more to haue
the littel Isle of Scicile, the territory of the Numidians and the mean
Citie of the Samnites beyng daiely within their kennyng and smell,
rather then to obtein populous Gaule, plenteous Pannony, or manly
Macedony liyng farre from sight and out of their circle or compasse.
This desire semeth to rise of a great prudent and vigilante policy, for
as a prince is of more puissaunce when his countreis ioyne, so is he of
more strength when his power is at hande. And as men lackyng comforte

be more releued by frendes whiche be presente, then by kinsfolke
dwellyng in forein and regions farre of. So princes haue commonly
coue
                     •
                  ed and euer desired to se and beholde their dominions liyng nere
about them, rather then to here by reporte from the countreis farre distant
from them. If this hathe bene the pollecy of conquerours, thappetite
of purchasers and the study of gouerners, why doth your grace
desire Fraunce before Scotlande, or coue
                     •
                   a countrey farre from your
sight, before a realme vnder your nose? Do you not remember how the
hole Isle of Britain was one entier Monarchi in the time of your noble
auncetor Kyng Brute first kyng and ruler of your famus Empire
and glorious region: whiche deuidyng his realme to his thre sonnes
gaue to Lothryne his eldest sonne that part of Britain that your highnes
now enioyeth, and to Albanact his second sonne he gaue the countrey
of Albany nowe called Scotland, and to Camber his third sonne
he gaue the countrey of Cambria nowe called Wales: reseruyng alwaies
to him &amp; his heires homage, lege and feaultie loiall for the same
countreis and dominions. By this deuisiō, the glory of the monarchie
of Britayne was clerely defaced, by this separacion the strength of the
Britishe kynges was sore diminished, by this dispersion intestine war
began, and Ciuil rebellion sprange first within this region. For while
all was vnder one, no nacion durste either once inuade or attempte
warre against the Britons: but when the land was once deuided and
the monarchie vndone, outward enemitie or foreyn hostilitie not halfe
so muche infested, greued or troubled the valiaunt Brittons as their
owne neighboures discended of one parent, and come of one progeny.
For the Albanac
                     •
                  es otherwise called the false fraudulēt Scottes, and
the Cambers otherwise called the vnstable Welshemen, did not alonly
withdrawe their fealtie, denie their homage, and refuse their allegiance
due to the kynges of this realme, but also made continuall warre
and destroied their tounes and slewe the people of their neyghboures
and Britons. For whiche cause, diuerse of your noble progenitoures
haue not only made warre and subdewed the Scottes for the deniyng
of their homage and stirryng of rebellion, but also haue deposed their
kynges &amp; princes and erected and set vp other in their estates and dignities.
Scater kyng of Scottes, for his rebellion was by Dunwallo
Moluncius your noble predecessor slayn and extincted. Kyng Arthure
also the Glory of the Brittons erected Angosile to the scepter of Scotland
and receaued of hym homage and fealtie. Yf I shuld reherse how
many kynges of Scotland haue done homage to your auncient predecessors,
or reherse howe many Scottishe kynges they haue corrected
and punished for their disobedience and deniyng of homage, or declare
what kynges they as superior lordes and high Emperoures ouer the
vnderkinges of Scotland, haue elected &amp; made rulers, to thētent that
all people might manifestly perceiue that it was more glorious, more
honourable and more famous to a Kyng to make a Kyng then to be a

kyng hy natural discent, I assure you, your eares woulde be more wery
of hearyng, then my tounge would be fatigate with open truth tellyng.
Your noble progenitour kyng Edward the firste couetyng to be
superior and to surmount in honour, or at the least to be equiuolent in
fame with his noble ancestours and famous progenitors, daily studied
and hourely compassed howe to bryng the whole Isle of Briteygne
whiche by Brute was deuided into thre partes into one monarchy and
one dominion. After longe studie and greate consultacion had, he
subdewed Wales, and tamed the wylde people and broughte that vnruly
parte to his olde home and aunciente degree, whiche thyng done
he likewyse inuaded Scotlande and conquered the countreye to the
towne of Perche called Saincte Ihons towne standyng on the riuer
of Tay, whiche he walled, diched and fortefied, rulyng that part with
Englishe lawes, Englyshe customes and by Englishe Iudges, and
was all moste at a poynte thereof to haue made a perfighte conqueste
and a complete Monarchie. But Oh Lorde, hasty deathe whiche maketh
an ende of all mortall creatures, sodeynly berefte hym of his life
and toke awaie his spirite, and so all thynges whiche he had deuised,
whiche he had ymagened and seriously pretended, the small momente
of an houre turned vpside doune and sodainly subuerted. Sith whose
deathe your greate Graundfather, ye and your noble father haue attempted
to bryng that runnegate region into his auncient course and
former line, as a thyng bothe necessary, conueniente and mete to bee
ioyned and vnited to this realme, and so not only to reuiue the old empire
and famous Monarchye, but also to vnite and cōbine that vertue
and strēgth whiche from the tyme of Brute was dispersed and seuered,
in one body, in one hed and one corporacion. Wherfore, if to your high
wisedome it semeth not necessary takyng this terme neccssary for nedefull
to conquere the realme of Scotlande as a thyng that nedes muste
be doen, yet will I not flie from my first saiyng, but proue it necessary
(as the logicall paraphrasian and Philosophical interpreters) do by a
distinccion expounde this terme necessary to signifie a thyng conuenient:
That the conquest in Scotlande before the inuadyng of Fraunce
is moste expedient, for experience teacheth and reason agreeth that euery
persone entēdyng a purposed enterprise, or a determinate voyage
should onely prouide and make preparacion for all thynges requisite
and nedefull for his purpose or exployte, but also ought vigilantly to
forsee withLynt is a beast like to a wolfe, whose sighte dooeth perce al thynges. Lincis iyes, and preuēt and study with the serpentyne pollicie
how to aduoyde and refell all thynges whiche might ether bee an
impediment to his progression and settyng forward or occasion of his
returne and losse of his enterprise, least he leuyng behynd hym an euill
neighbour, a continuall aduersary &amp; a secrete enemie, maie assone lese
his owne propre realme, as conquere and gayne the dominion of another:
wherfore the trite and common adage saith, leaue not the certain
for the vncertain. Wherefore it is necessary that I enucleate and open

to you certain articles conteined in the old league and amitie betwene
the realmes of Fraunce and Scotlande, wherof the wordes be these.
               
                  THE warre or iniurye moued or doen by the Englishemen to one of 
thesaied nacions, to be as a commen wrong to bothe.
               
                  IF the Englishemen make warre on the Frenche nacion, then the 
the Scottes at the costes and charges of the Frenche kyng, shall minister
to theim succours.
               
                  LIKEVVYSE if the Scottes be molested by the English warres,
the Frenche nacion hauyng their costes allowed, shall bee to theim ayders
and assisters.
               
                  AND that none of bothe the nacions shall ether contracte or make 
peacewith the realme of Englande without the consente and agrement
of the other.
               
                  AND to thentent that this league and amitee should be kept vnuiolate
Robert le Bruse the vsurper of Scotland willed by his testamēt
twoo thynges in especiall to bee obserued, the one, neuer to breake the
treatie concluded with Fraunce: The second neuer to kepe peace or promes
with Englishmen lenger then the kepyng therof were to theim ether
profitable or necessary. Yet Ihon Mayer and other Scottish writers
coloure this cause, saiyng that he would haue no peace concluded
with Englande aboue thre yeres. But whatsoeuer writers write or talkers
saie, thei bee to hym moste faithfull executors and haue neuer yet
broken his testament but daily kepe his precept and commaundement
And for the performaunce of this will and kepyng of this league, none
of your auncetours euer inuaded Fraunce, but incontinent the Scottes
troubled and vexed England. None of your progenitors euer passed
the sea in iust quarell against the Frēche nacion, but the Scottishe
people in their absence entered your realme, spoyled your houses, slewe
your people and toke great praies innumerable, only to prouoke your
auncestors for to returne frō the inuadyng of Fraūce. If I should declare
to you their comen breakyng of leagues, their craftie and subtill
dissimulaciō, their false faire promises often sworne and neuer kept, I
doubt not but you would ten tymes more abhorre their doyng, then I
would bee ashamed of the tellyng. Therfore I saie still, and affirme it
necessary and conuenient to forse, that you leaue no enemies behind at
your backe when you go to conquere aduersaries before your face. Beside
this, if you consider the daily charges, the inconstant chances that
maie happen, I thinke, yea and litle doubt but Scotlande shalbee tamed
before Fraunce shalbe framed. For if you wil inuade Fraunce, accompt
what number of shippes must transport your armie, recon what
charge of ancors, what a multitude of Cables, and what innumerable
thynges apperteigne to a nauie. When you be there, if your men decay
by sickenes or by sworde, if vitaill faile, or if money waxe skante, if the
wynde turne contrary or an hideous tempeste arise, you shall bee destitute
of aide, prouisiō and treasure, whiche in a strange region are the cō
                  fusion

&amp; defacyng of an armie. On the other side, if you inuade Scotlande,
your men bee at hande, your vitaill is nere, your aide is euer at
your backe, so that in that voyage you shall haue haboundance in all
thynges, and of nothyng you shall haue wante. See what an occasion
fortune hath offered vnto you, is not their kyng your captiue and prisoner?
Is not the realme in greate deuision for the crueltie of the duke
of Albany, rather desiryng to haue a forain gouernor, then a naturall
tyraunt Wherfore my counsaill is, firste to inuade Scotlande, and by
Gods grace to conquere and ioyne that region to youre Empire, and
to restore the renoumed Monarchy of Britayne to her olde estate and
preheminence, and so beautified with realmes and furnished with people,
to entree into Fraunce for the recoueryng of your righteous title
and true inheritaunce, in obseruyng the old auncient prouerbe vsed by
our forfathers, whiche saieth, he that will Fraunce wynne, muste with
Scotlande firste begyn.
               
                  NO ꝙ the Duke of Excester vncle to the Kyng,An O

                     acion of the Duke of Excester. (whiche was well
learned, and sente into Italy by his father entendyng to haue been a
prieste) he that will Scotlande win, let hym with Fraunce first begin.
For if you call to remembraunce the comon saiyng of the wise and expert
Philicions, whiche bothe write and teache, that if you will heale a
malady you must firste remoue the cause: If you will cure a lore, you
muste first take awaie the humor that fedeth the place: If you will destroy
a plante, plucke awaie his sap whiche is his norisshyng and life.
Then if Fraunce be the nori
                     •
                  sher or Scotlande, if the Frenche penciōs
be the susteiners of the Scottishe nobilitee, if the educacion of Scottes
in Fraunce be the cause of practise and pollicie in Scotlande, then
plucke away Fraunce and the courage of the nobles of Scotland shal
be sone daunted and appalled: Take awaie Fraunce and the hertes of
the comen people wil sone decaie and waxe faint: Plucke away Fraūce
and neuer looke that Scotlande will resist or withstande your power.
For when the hed is gone, the body sone falleth, and when the sap fayleth
the tree sone withereth. Let men reade the Chronicles and peruse
our Englishe Chronographiers, &amp; you shall sone finde that the Scottes
haue seldō of their owne 
                     •
                  ocion inuaded or vexed Englande, but
onely for the obseruyng of the league in the whiche thei bee bounde to
Fraunce: For the Scottes are the shaft and dart of the Frenchemen to
shote and cast at their pleasure against the Englishe nacion. And wher
thei haue inuaded, as I cannot deny but thei haue dooen, what glory
or what profite succeded of their entrep
                     •
                  ice, I report me to their peculier
histories. Kyng Malcolyn inuaded Englande, when kyng Williā
the 
                     •
                  econd was makyng warre in Normandy. Dauid le Bruse also entered
Englande, your greate graundfather kyng Edward the third liyng
at the siege of Caleis. Was not Malcolin slain beside Tinmouth
and kyng Dauid taken beside Durrham. Let the gouernors of Scotlande,
(for the kyng is sure ynough) entre into Englande on that price

and se what he shall gayne therby. What notable acte wer Scottes euer
able to do out of their owne countree and propre climate? Or when
wer thei able to cōueigh an armie ouer the sea at their owne costes and
expences? Rede their owne histories and you shall finde fewe or none.
Their nature and condicion is to tary at home in idlenes, ready to defende
their countree like brute beastes, thinkyng their rusticall fassion
to be high honestie, and their beggerly liuyng to bee a welfare. Beside
this, what auncient writer or autentike historiographier ether writ of
them honor or once nameth theim, ex
                     •
                  pte sainct Iherom, whiche saieth
that when he was yong, he sawe in Fraunce certain Scottes of the isle
of Britain eate the fleshe of men, and when thei came into the woodes
findyng there greate heardes of beastes and flockes of shepe, lefte the
beastes and cut of the buttockes of the heardmen and the pappes and
brestes of the sheperdes womē, extemyng this meate to be the greatest
deinties: And Sabellicus saieth that Scottes muche delighte and
reioyse in liyng. You may now apparauntly perceiue what puissaunce
Scotland is of it self, litle able to defende and lesse able to inuade like
a noune adiectiue that cannot stand without a substantiue. If Fraūce
be taken from thē, of whom shall thei seke aide? Denmarke will thē refuse
because the kyng is your brother inlawe: Portyngall &amp; Castel wil
not them regarde, bothe the kynges beeyng your cosyns germain and
auntes sonnes: Italy is to farre: Germany and Hungary be with you
in league. So that of necessitee thei in conclusion destitute of all ayde,
depriued of all succoure, bereued of all frendship (if Fraunce be cōquered)
must without warre or dent of sworde come vnder your subieccion
and due obeysance. And yet I would not in this your conquest, Fraūce
should bee so muche mynded, that Scotlande should be forgotten, nor
that your entier power should be sent into Fraunce and no defence left
against the inuasions of Scotlande. For of that might ensue this mischief,
that if your whole power wer vanquisshed in Fraūce, the Scottes
beyng elated by the victory of their frendes might do more displeasor
to your realme in one yere then you should recouer again in fiue.
But sithe God hath sent you people, riches, municiōs of warre and all
thynges necessary, ether to inuade bothe, or to defende the one and penetrate
the other. Passe the sea your self with an armie royall, and leue
my lorde of Westmerlande and other graue capitaines of the Northe
with a conuenient nombre to defende the Marches if the subtill Scottes
encouraged by the Frenchmen will any thyng attēpt duryng your
voyage and absence. And this is to be remēbred, if you get Scotlande
you haue a countree barayne almoste of all pleasure and goodnes, you
gayne people sauage, waueryng and constant, of riches you shall haue
litle and of pouertie muche: But if you get Fraunce, you shall haue a
countree fertile, pleasant and plentifull, you shall haue people, Ciuill,
witty and of good ordre. You shall haue riche citees, beautiful tounes
innumerable Castles .xxiiij. puyssaunt Duchies, lxxx. and odde populous

Countrees, and an hūdred and thre famous bisshoprickes, a .M.
and more fat Monastaries, and parishe Churches (as the Frenche writers
affirme) x.C. thousande and mo. This conquest is honorable, this
gayne is proffitable, this iourney is plesaunte, and therfore nether to
be left nor forslewed. Uitaill you shall haue sufficient from Flaunders
aide of men you maie haue daily out of England, or els to leaue a competente
crewe in the Marches of Caleis to refreshe your armie and to
furnishe still your numbre. Although the cost in transportyng your mē
be greate, yet your gayne shalbe greater, and therfore accordyng to the
trite adage, he muste liberally spende that will plentefully gayne. And
because my lorde of Westmerlāde hath alleged that the Romaines desired
the dominion of suche as were vnder flight of their owne Egle, or
whose possessions were a mote to their eye, as the Numidians &amp; other
whiche he hath wisely rehersed. Behold the condicions of the counsailers
and the desire of the mouers, what persones were they whiche coueted
their poore neighbors rather then riche foreines? Men effeminate,
more mete for a Carpet then a Campe, men of a weake stomacke
desiryng rather to walke in a pleasant gardein then passe the sees in a
tempesteous storme, what should I saie? Menne that woulde haue
somewhat and yet take litell payne, menne that coueted thynges nothyng
honourable nor yet greatly profitable. But I remember that
the noble Cato the Censor whiche when it was alledged in the Senate
at Rome that Affrike was farre of, and the sea brode, and the
iourney perillous caused certain newe figges to bee brought into the
Senate, whiche grewe in the territory of Carthage, and demaunded
of the Senators howe they liked the Figges? Some saied they were
newe, some said they were swete and some said they were pleasant. Oh
qoud Cato, if they be newe gathered, thē is not the region farof where
they grewe (
                     •
                   kant thre daies sailyng) and if it be of no longer distance
then so nere to vs be oure enemies. If the figges be swete, then is the
soile delicious and fertile. If the fygges be pleasante, then is the coū
                  trey
profitable. If you gaine the Scicilians, you shall be riche men in
corne. If you get the Samnites you shall haue plenty of oyle. If you
vanquishe the Numidians, you shall haue copie of beastes: but subdewe
Carthage and conquere affricke, you shall haue not onely Corne
Oyle and beastes, but gold, purple, precious stones, Oliphantes and
all thynges bothe necessary and pleasant. Therfore my councell is rather
to seke riches beyng farre distant then pouertie liyng at hand, for
paine is forgotten euer where gaine foloweth. This noble saiyng of
sage Cato so encouraged and inflamed the haut hertes and lusty courages
of the manly Romains, that they neuer desisted to persecute the
people of Affricke tyll Carthage was vtterly destroyed and the whole
countrey subdewed and brought vnder the Romain Empire. Iulius
Ceasar also desired rather to conquere the Brittons deuided from the
continent, ye and inhabityng almost in thend of the world, rather then

to gayne the Pannonians adioynyng to Italy, saiyng, breke the strō
                  ger
and the weaker will bowe: Subdue the riche and the pore wil yeld
be lord of the lordes and the vassalles must nedes be subiect, vanquish
the Frenchemen and the Scottes be tamed. This counsaill of Cato,
and this saiyng of Cesar maketh me bothe to speke and thynke that if
you get Fraunce, ye get two, and if you get Scotland you get but one
When the duke had said and sat doune, his opinion was muche noted
and well digested with the kyng, but in especiall with his thre brethrē
and diuerse other lordes beyng yong and lusty, desirous to wyn honor
and profite in the realme of Fraunce, ensuyng the couragious actes of
their noble progenitors, whiche gat in that region bothe honor and renoune.
So that now al men cried warre, warre, Fraunce, Fraunce, and
the bil put into the parliament for desoluyng of religious houses was
clerely forgotten and buried, and nothyng thoughte on but onely the
recoueryng of Fraunce accordyng to the title by the Archbishoppe declared
and set furth. And so vpon this poynct after a fewe Actes for the
publicke wealth of the realme condiscended and agreed, the parliamēt
was proroged to Westminster.
               
                  THE kyng like a wise prince and pollitique gouernor, entendyng to
obserue the auncient ordres of famous kynges and renoumed potentates
vsed aswel emong Paynimes as Christians, whiche is, not to inuade
another mannes territory without open war and the cause of the
same to hym published and declared, dispatched into Fraūce his vncle
the duke of Excester and the erle of Dorcet, the lorde Grey admirall of
Englande, the Archbishop of Deuelin, the bishop of Norwiche with .v
hundred horsse, whiche were lodged in the Temple hous in Paris, kepyng
suche triumphante chere in their lodgyng, and suche a solempne
estate in ridyng through the citee, that the Parisians &amp; all the Frenche
men had no small meruell at their honorable fassions and lordly behaueors.
The Frenche kyng receiued them very honorably, and sumpteously
banquetted theim, shewyng to theim goodly iustes and marciall
pastymes, by the space of three daies together, in the whiche iustes the
kyng hymself to shewe his courage and actiuitee to the Englishemen,
manfully brake speres and lustely turneyed.
               
                  VVHEN this great triumph and marciall disport was finished, the
Englishe Ambassadors accordyng to their commission, required of the
Frenche kyng to deliuer to the kyng of Englād the realme and croune
of Fraunce with the entier Duchies of Aquitain, Normandy and Aniowe,
with the countrees of Poytieu and Mayne and diuerse other requestes,
offryng that if the Frenche kyng would without warre of effusion
of Christen bloud rendre to the kyng their Master his very righte
and lawfull inheritaunce, that he would be content to take in mariage
the lady Katheryn doughter to the Frenche kyng &amp; to endewe her with
all the duchie and countrees before rehersed. And if he entended not so
to do, then the kyng of Englande did expresse and signifie to hym that

with the ayd of God and help of his people he would recouer his right
and inheritaunce wrongfully with holden with mortall warre and dēt
of sworde. The Frenchemen were muche abasshed at these demaundes
thinkyng theim very vnresonable and farre excessiue, and yet not willyng
to make any determinate aunswer till thei had farther brethed in
so weighty a cause, praied thenglishe Ambassadors to saie to the kyng
their master that thei now hauyng no oportunitee to cōclude in so hie a
matter would shortly send Ambassadors into England whiche should
certefy &amp; declare to the kyng their whole mynde, purpose and aunswer.
               
                  THE Englishe Ambassadors nothyng content with this doyng departed
into Englande makyng relacion of euery thyng that was said
or dooen. Here I ouerpasse howe some writers saie that the Dolphyn
thinkyng kyng Henry to be geuen still to suche plaies and light folies
as he exercised &amp; vsed before the tyme that he was exalted to the croune
sent to hym a tunne of tennis balles to plaie with, as who saied that he
could better skil of tennis then of warre, and was more expert in light
games then marcial pollicy. Whether he wer moued with this vnwise
presente, or espiyng that the Frenchemen dalied and vaynely delayed
his purpose and demaund, was moued and pricked forward I cannot
iudge, but su
                     •
                  e it is that after the returne of his Ambassadors, he beeyng
of a haute courage and bold stomacke, liuyng now in the pleasantest
tyme of his age, muche desiryng to enlarge and dilate his Empire
and dominion, determined fully to make warre in Fraunce, cōceiuyng
a good trust and a perfight hope in this poyncte whiche he had before
experimented, whiche is, that victory for the moste part foloweth wher
right leadeth, auaunced forward by Iustice and sette furth by equitie.
And because many Frenchemen wer promoted to Ecclesiastical dignitees,
some to benefices, some to Abbeies and priores within his realme
and sent daily innumerable somes of money into Fraunce for the relefe
and aide of their naturall countremen and lineall kynsmen, he therfore
for the publique wealth of his realme and subiectes, ordeigned that no
straunger here after, should bee promoted to any spirituall dignitee or
degree within his realme without his especiall licence and royall concent,
and that all thei that should so be admitted, should find sufficient
suretie not to disclose ye secretes of this realme to any forain or straūge
person, nor also to minister to them any aide or succor with money or by
any other meane. Beside this he assembled a greate puissance &amp; gathered
a greate hoste through all his dominions, and for the more furniture
of his nauie, he sent into Holand, zeland and Frizeland to conduct
and hire shippes for the transportyng and conueighyng ouer his men
and municions of warre, and finally prouided for armure, vitaile, money,
artillary, carraiges, tētes and other thinges necessary for so hie an
enterprise: Whiche prouisions wer sone blowen into Fraūce &amp; quickly
knowen in Paris. Wherefore the Dolphin who had taken on hym the
gouernance of the realme, be cause his father was fallen again into his

olde infirmitie, sent for the dukes of Berry and Alaunson and all the
counseil of Fraunce, to cōclude what should be done in so great a matter
and so weightie a cause. After long cōsultacion, it was determined
to assemble people through the whole realme of Fraunce, to resist &amp; repulce
the kyng of Englande and his puissaunce whensoeuer he would
arriue or set foote in Fraunce, and also to fortifie their tounes &amp; stuffe
thē with garrisons and men of warre, and farther by taxes &amp; subsedies
to leuy as muche money as by wit or pollicie could be deuised or imagined.
Moreouer to staie the kyng of England at home, it was polletiquely
deuised to sende to him a solempne Ambassade to make to him
some offers accordyng to the demaundes before rehersed. The charge
of this Ambassade was cōmitted to the earle of Uandosme, to Maister
Wylliam Bouratier Archebishop of Bourgues and to Maister Peter
Fremel bishoppe of Lysieux and to the lorde of Yury and Braquemont
and to Maister Gaultier Cole the kynges secretory and diuerse
other. These ambassadours accompanied with .CCC. and fifty horses
passed the sea at Caleys and lāded at Douer, before whose arriual the
kyng was departed from Wyndsor to Winchester, entendyng to haue
gone to Hampton and to haue viewed his nauie, but hearyng of the
Ambassadours approchyng, taried stil at Wynchester, where the sayd
Frenche lordes shewed them selues verye honorably before the kyng
and the nobilitie. And in the bishoppes hal before the kyng, sittyng in
his throne imperial &amp; his lordes spiritual and temporal &amp; a great multitude
of the cōmons there for that entent assēbled, At a tyme prefixed,
the Archebishop of Bourgesse made an eloquent and a long Oracion,
dissuadyng warre, and praisyng peace, offeryng to the kyng of Englād
a great some of money with diuerse base &amp; pore countries with the Lady
Katherin in mariage, so that he would dissolue his armie &amp; dismisse
his souldiors whiche he had gathered and made ready.
               When this Oracion was ended, the kyng caused the Ambassadors
to be highly feasted, &amp; set thē at his owne table, And at a daie assigned
in the foresayd hall, the Archebishoppe of Cauntorbury made to their
Oracion a notable answere: theffecte wherof was, that if the Frenche
kyng wold not geue with his daughter in mariage, the duchies of Acquitain,
Normandy, Aniowe, &amp; al other seignories &amp; dominions somtime
apperteinyng to the noble progenitors of the kyng of Englād, he
would in no wise retire his army nor breake his iorney but would with
al diligence entre into the realme of Fraūce &amp; destroy the people, depopulate
the coūtry &amp; subuert the tounes, with sword blud &amp; fyre, &amp; neuer
cease til he had recouered his auncient right &amp; lawful patrimony. The
kyng auowed the archbishops saiyng, &amp; in the word of a prince promised
to performe it to the vttermost. The bishop of Bourgesse beyng in
flamed with anger that his purpose toke none effect, desiryng licence &amp;
pardō of the king that he might speake: whiche once attained he verye
rashly and vnreuerētly sayd. Thynkest thou to put doune and destroy

wrongfully the most christen kyng, our most redoubted souerain lord
and most excellentest prince of al christianitie of blud and preheminēce
Oh kyng, sauyng thine honour, thinkest thou that he hathe offered or
caused to be offred to the landes, goodes, or other possessions with his
owne daughter for feare of the or thy Englishe nacion, or thy friendes
or wel willers or fautours. No no? but of truthe he moued with pitie,
as a louer of peace, to the entent that innocent blud should not bee dispersed
abrode, and that christian people shoulde not bee afflicted with
battail and destroied with mortall warre, hathe made to the this reasonable
offers and this Godly mocion, puttyng his hole affiance in god
most puissant accordyng to right and reason, trustyng in his quarel to
be ayded and supported by his beneuolente subiectes and fauourable
well willers. And sith we be subiectes and seruauntes, we require the
to cause vs safely and surely without dammage to be conducted out of
thy realme and dominions &amp; that thou wilt write thyne answere wholy
as thou hast geuen it, vnder thy seale and signe manuell.
               
                  THE Kyng of Englande nothyng vexed nor yet moued with the
presumptuous saiynges and proude bragges of the vnnurtered and
vnmanerly byshop, but well remēbryng kyng Salomon in the .xxiiii.
of his Prouerbes, whiche saithe, that with discrecion warres muste be
taken in hand, &amp; where many can geue councell, there is victory, coldly
and sobrely aunswered the bishop saiyng: My lorde, I littell esteme
your Frenche bragges, and lesse set by your powre &amp; strength, I know
perfightly my right to your region, and excepte you will deny the apparant
truthe so do you, and yf you neither do nor will knowe yet god
and the world knoweth it. The powre of your Mayster you see daily,
but my puissance you haue not yet tasted, If your master haue louing

                     •
                  rendes and faithfull subiectes, I am I thanke God not disgarnished
nor vnprouided of the same: But this I say vnto you, that before one
yere passe I trust to make the highest croune of your countrey stoupe
and the proudest Miter to kneele downe: And saie this to the vsurper
your Maister that I within thre monethes wyll enter into France not
as into his land, but as into mine owne true and lawfull patrimonye
entendyng to conquere it, not with braggyng wordes, flatteryng oracions
or coloured persuasions, but with puissaunce of men and dent of
sworde by the aide of God in whome is my whole trust and confidence.
And as concernyng mine answere to be written, subscribed and sealed,
I assure you that I woulde not speake that sentence the which I wold
not write and subscribe, nor subscribe that line to the whiche I would
refuse to put my seale. Therfore your saueconducte shal be to you deliuered
with mine answere, and then you may departe surely and safely
I warrant you into your countrey, where I truste soner to visite you
then you shall haue cause to salute or bid me welcome. With this answere
the Ambassadours sore dismaied, but more displeased (although
they were highly entertained &amp; liberally rewarded, departed into their

countrye, relatyng to the Dolphyn and the kynges councel what they
had done duryng the tyme of their Ambassade.
               After the frenche Ambassadours were departed, the kyng as I sayd
before hauing a great foresight and disposyng all thynges in an ordre
forgettyng not the olde pranckes and sodeyn trickes of the variable
Scottishe nacion, appoincted the earle of Westmerlande, the lorde
Scrope, the Baron of Greystocke and sir Robert Umfreuile with diuers
other hardye parsonages &amp; valiant capitaynes to kepe the frontiers
and Marches adioynyng to Scotland, whiche sir Robert Umfreuile
on the day of Mari Magdalene entred with the Scottes at the
toune of Gederyng, hauyng in his company only .CCCC. Englishemen,
where he after long conflict and doubtful battaile slewe of his enemies
.lx. and odde, and toke captynes .CCC.lx. and discomfited and
put to flight a thousand and moo, whom he folowed in chace alone .xii.
miles, and so laded with praies and prisoners reculed agayne not vnhurt
to the castle of Rokesbroughe, of the whiche at that tyme he was
chief capitayne and gouernour.
               When the kyng had ordered all thynges for the tuicion and sauegarde
of his realme and people, he leauyng behynd him for gouernor
of the realme, the Quene his mother inlawe, departed to the toune of
Southhampton, entending there to take ship, and so to transfrete into
Fraunce. And to thentent he would steale on the Frenche kyng before
he were ware of him, he dispatched Antelop his pursuiuant at Armes
with letters, the whiche the Frenche cronographers declare to be these.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           TO the right honorable prince Charles our cossyn of Fraunce &amp; aduersary,
                        Henry by the grace of God kyng of England &amp; of Fraunce. &amp;c.
                     
                     To deliuer to euery man his owne, is a woorke of inspiracion and a
deede of sage councel, for right noble prince our cosyn and aduersary,
sometymes the noble realmes of England &amp; of Fraunce were vnited,
whiche nowe be seperated and deuided, and as then they were accustomed
to be exalted through the vniuersal worlde by their glorious victories,
and it was to them a notable vertue to decore and beautifye the
house of God, to the whiche apperteined holynes, and to set a concorde
in Christes religion. And by their agreable warres they brought fortunately
the publike enemies to their subiection: but alas this fraternal
fayth is peruerted to fraternal occasion as Lot persecuted Abrahā
by humayne impulsion, but nowe the glory of fraternal loue is deade,
and the discent of auncient humaine cōdicion is departed, and mother
malice and Ire are resuscitate from death to life, but we cal to wytnes
the souereigne iudge in cōscience, whiche wil not bow either for praier
or for gi
                           ••
                        es, that we to our power for pure loue haue proceaded by all
meanes to peace &amp; amite. And sith we haue red in writyng and by coū
                        cel
haue learned the iust title of our inheritaunce from vs deteined in
preiudice of oure auncient linage, we be not of so small a courage but
that we wyll fight to death to obteyne right and iustice: but by the authoritie

written in the boke of Deuteronomy, all men are taught whiche
come to besiege or assaulte any cytie or fortresse, fyrst to offre peace
And albeit that violence the rauisher of iustice haue takē away of lōg
tyme the noblenes of our croune and oure iuste inheritaunce, yet we by
charitie haue done what we might to recouer and bryng our old inheritaunce
to the first degree and auncient estate, and therefore for faute
of iustice we may returne to armes. Wherfore, that our glorye may be
wytnes of our conscience nowe and also by personal request, in the beginnyng
of our iorney to the whiche we are toward for faute of iustice,
we exhort you in the bowelles of our sauiour Iesu Christ, whose euangelical
doctrine willeth that you ought to render to al men that which
you ought to do, and so to do to vs is the wyl of God oure souereigne
lorde and creator. And to thentent that theffusion of Christen people
shuld be exchewed whiche are the images of God, we haue demaunded
our right and restitucion of the same from vs wrongfully withholden
and deteined, or at the least of suche thinges whiche we haue so often
times by our Ambassadors and messengers required &amp; instantly desyred,
wherwith we haue offered to be pleased, satisfied and cōtented for
the onely reuerence of almightie God &amp; for the vtilitie of a vniuersall
peace whiche we thought should haue ensued. And therfore we for our
part because of a mariage to be had and cōcluded betwene vs, wer determined
to forsake &amp; refuse the fiftye thonsand crounes to vs last promised
and profered, preferryng peace before riches, &amp; chosyng rather
our rightful patrimony to vs by oure noble progenitors lawfully deuoluted
and discended with oure cossyn your daughter the fayre lady
Katherin, rather then for treasure and desire of money the multiplier
of iniquitie, shamefully to dishenerite our selfe and the croune of oure
realme whiche God forbid. 
                     
                        Youen vnder oure priuy seale at our Castel of Hampton on the sea side, the .v. day of August.
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  VVHEN the letter was presented to the Frenche kyng &amp; by his councel
well ouerloked, he made answere to thofficers of armes that he had
wel perceiued the content of the letters, whereupon he would take aduice
and prouide for the same in tyme and place conuenient, licensyng
the messenger to depart at his pleasure.
            
            
               ¶The third yere.The iii. yere.
               
               
                  THis noble prince hauyng his nauy furnished, and al thinges
necessary for suche a royal voyage, perceiuyng his freshe capitaines
to complain that thei had lost so many monethes of
the yere in the whiche they might haue done diuerse haute
terprices in the lādes of theyr enemies, and that nothyng was to thē &amp;
more odius then prolongyng lingeryng of tyme, determined with all
diligence to cause his souldiors to entre his shippes and so to depart.
               
                  SE the chaunce, the night before the day of departure appoincted, he
was credibly informed that Richarde earle of Cambridge brother to

Edward duke of Yorke and Henry lorde Scrope &amp; syr Thomas Gray
knight had cōpassed his death and finall distruction: wherfore he caused
them to be apprehended lamentyng sore his chaunce that he should
be compelled to loose suche personages by whose valiantnes and puissaunce
he should be more dreadful and feareful to his foes &amp; enemies.
When these prisoners were examined, they not onely confessed the cō
                  spiracy,
but also declared that for agreat some of mony which they had
receiued of the Frenche kyng, they intēded either to deliuer the kyng a
liue into the handes of his enemies, or els to murther him before that
he shuld arriue in the duchy of Normādy. When kyng Henry hard al
thinges opened whiche he sore desired, he caused al his nobilitie to assē
                  ble
before his maiestie royal, before whom he caused to be brought the
thre great offendors and to them sayd: If you haue conspired the deth
and destruction of me whiche am the head of the realme and gouernor
of the people, without doubt I must of necessitie thinke that you likewyse
haue compassed the confusion of al that be here with me and also
the final destruction of your natiue countrey and natural region. And
although some priuate Scorpion in your heartes, or some wild worme
in your heades hath caused you to conspire my death and cōfusion, yet
you shuld haue spared that deuelish enterprice as long as I was with
mine army whiche cannot cōtinue without a capitaine, nor be directed
without a guide, nor yet with the destruction of your owne bloud and
nacion you should haue pleased a forein enemy and an auncient aduersary.
Wherfore seyng that you haue enterprised so great a mischiefe, so
abhominable a fact, to thentent that your fautors beyng in the armye
may abhorre so detestable an offence by the punishement of you, hast
you to receiue the payne that for your demerites you haue deserued, &amp;
that punishment that by the lawe for your offences is prouided.
               
                  VVHEN these noble men were executed, the kyng sayd to his lordes,
se you not the madde imaginacion of men whiche persecute me
that dayely studye, and hourely labour, to my great trauaile and vnquietnes
for the aduauncement of the publique wealth of this realme
and region, and for that cause I spare no payne nor refuse no tyme, to
thentent to do good to all men, and to hurt no man, and thus to do is
my dutie &amp; to this as I thinke am I borne. I pray to God that ther be
none among you that be infected with so much vntruth that had leuer
se me destroied and brought to confusion, rather then to se his coūtrey
florishe encreased with honor and empyre. I assure you that I cōceiue
no suche opinion in any of you, but put in you both trust &amp; confidence
and if I may haue your helpe to beautify my realme and to recouer againe
the olde honor of myne auncestours by subduyng the Frenche
nacion, I for my selfe wyll forget al peril and paine and be your guide
lodesman and conductor. And if you drawe backe and wyll not moue
forwarde, beleueue me, God wyll so dispose, that hereafter you shalbe
deceiued and sore repent had I wyst. When the kyng had finished his

saiyng, all the noble men kneled doune &amp; promised faythfully to serue
him and duely to obey him, and rather to dye then to suffre him to fall
into the handes of his enemies.
               
                  THIS done, the kyng thought surely in his conceipte all sedicion to
be drouned &amp; vtterly extincte. But if he had cast his eye to the fyre that
was newly kindled, he should haue surely sene an horrible flame incē
                  sed
against the walles of his owne house and family, by the whiche in
conclusion his line and stocke was cleane destroyed and consumed to
ashes, whiche fyre at that verye tyme paraduenture might haue bene
quenched and put out. For diuerse write that Richard earle of Cambridge
did not conspire with the lorde Scrope and sir Thomas Graye
to murther kyng Henry to please the Frenche kyng withal, but onely
to thentent to exalte to the croune his brotherinlawe Edmond earle of
Marche as heyre to duke Lyonel. After whose death consideryng that
the earle of Marche for diuerse secrete impedimentes was not hable to
haue generacion, he was sure that the croune should come to him by
his wife, or to his children. And therfore it is to be thought that he rather
cōfessed him selfe for nede of money to be corrupted by the Frēche
kyng, then he would declare his inwarde mynd &amp; open his very entent
For surely he sawe that if this purpose were espied, the earle of March
should haue dronken of the same cup that he did, and what shuld haue
come to his owne children he muche doubted. And therfore beyng dedestitute
of comfort and in dispayre of life, to saue his children he fayned
that tale, desiryng rather to 
                     •
                  aue his succession then him selfe,
which he did in dede. For Richard duke of Yorke his sonne not priuely
but openly claimed the croune, and Edward his sonne both claimed &amp;
gained it as hereafter you shal heare, which thyng at this time if kyng
Henry had foresene I doubt whether either euer that line should haue
either claimed the garlande or gained the game.
               
                  VVHEN the wynde was prosperous and pleasaunt for the nauye to
set forward, they waied vp the Ankers and hoysed vp their sailes and
set forward with .C.xl. shippes on the vigile of the Assumpcion of our
Lady and toke land at Caux, comonly called Kyd Caux (where the riuer
of Seine runneth into the sea) without resistence or bludsheddyng.
The kyng was lodged on the shore in a small priory with the dukes of
Clarēce and Gloucester his bretherne: the duke of Excetter and Yorke,
the earles, Marshal, Oxforde, Suffolke, Warwicke and other lordes
were lodged not farre frō him. The next day after, he marched toward
the toune of Harflewe standyng on the riuer of Seyne betwene two
hilles and besieged it on euery parte. The capitaine of the toune was
the lorde Escouteuile with the lorde Blaynuile of Hacqueuile, the lordes
of Harmanuile of Galarde Boyes, of Clere de Becton, of Adsanches,
of Brian, of Gaucort, of Lisleadam and many othrr.
               
                  THE Frenche kyng beyng aduertised of the kynges arriuall, sente
in all the hast the lorde Delabreche constable of Fraunce and the lorde

Bonciqualt Marshall of Fraūce, the Seneschal of Henaude, the lorde
Ligny and diuerse other capitaines, whiche fortefied tounes with men
vitaile and artillary on all the sea coaste. And heryng that the kyng of
England had besieged Harflew at his first landyng, came to the castle
of Cawdebec beyng not farre from Harflewe, to thentent to succor their
frendes whiche wer besieged if thei might by any pollicy or inuencion,
and if not, then thei imagined how to sleye and hurte the Englishemen
when thei wente into the countree on foragyng for beastes and vitaill
and so trappe and destroye them, for thei cōstrued with themselfes that
their vitaile would sone faile because of the ayre of the sea and smell of
the water. But thei were deceiued, for notwithstandyng the prouision
and pollicy of the Frenchemen, the Englishmen forrayed the countree,
spoyled the villages and brought many a riche praie to the Campe be
fore Harflewe. Thenglishmen daily ceassed not to assaile the toune, the
duke of Gloucester to whō the ordre of the assaulte was comitted, made
thre mynes vnder the ground &amp; approched the walles with ordinaunce
and engynes, and would not suffre theim within to reste at any tyme.
The kyng liyng on the hill side with his battail did not onely kepe the
Frenchmen from succoryng of the toune, but also toke awaie from the
tounes men all the hope and trust of their succor, aide and relief, and also
al the gonnepouder that was sent by the Frenche kyng to them that
wer beseged was taken by thenglishmen. The capitaines of the Frēch
men within the toune perceiued that thei wer not able to resist the continuall
inuasions and hourely assaultes of the fierce Englishemenne,
and knowyng that their walles were vndermyned and shortely like to
fal, &amp; feryng that might happē of the chance if thei should fortune to be
ouercome and takē by force, desired of the kyng of England only truce
for thre daies, promisyng that if thei were not reskewed within thesame
tyme, then thei to yeld themselfes and the toune their liues only saued.
And to performe this, thei deliuered into the kynges possession .xxx. of
the beste capitaines and Marchauntes of the toune. The kyng of Englande
accepted this offre, least he entendyng greater exploites might
lese his tyme in suche small matters. When this composicion was agreed,
the lorde Hacqueuile was sent to the French kyng to declare the
necessite of the toune and the shorte tyme of the truce. To whō the dolphin
aunswered that the kynges power was not yet assembled in suche
a nombre as was conuenient to raise so greate a siege. When the aunswer
was reported to the capitaines, thei seyng no hope nor similitude
of aide and comfort to them commyng, after the third daie rendered to
the kyng of Englād the toune, beyng the .xxxvij. daie after that it was
besieged, whiche was the daie of sainct Mawrice, to the greate abashement
of all Normandy, for it was the soueraigne porte of al that countree.
The souldiours wer raunsomed and the toune was sacked to the
greate gayne of the Englishemen. The kyng of Englande ordeigned
capitain of the toune of Harflew his vncle Thomas duke of Excester

whiche established his leuetenaunte there Ihon Fastolffe with .xv.C.
men and .xxxv. kinghtes, wherof the Baron of Carew &amp; sir Hugh Lutterell
were two counsaillers. And because diuerse of his nobles liyng
before Harflew were sicke of the flixe and many wer ded, emongest whō
therle of Stafford, the bishop of Norwich, the lordes Molins and Burnell
wer foure beside other. The kyng licensed the duke of Clarēce his
brother, Ihon erle Marshall and Ihon erle of Arundel beyng infected
with that desease to returne into Englande.
               
                  KYNG Henry not a litle reioysyng of his good lucke and fortunate
successe in the beginnyng of his pretensed conquest, determined withal
diligence to set forward in performyng his intended purpose and warrely
enterprise, but because Wynter approched faster and more furiously
then before that tyme had been accustomed, he was sore troubled
and vexed. For the whiche cause he called together al the Cheuetaines
and men of pollicy in his armie to consult vpō the procedyng forward
and to be sure of waie and redy passage. After long debatyng and muche
reasonyng, it was as a thyng bothe necessary and conueniente and
fully agreed and determined to set forwarde withall diligence before
the dedde tyme of Winter approched, toward the toune of Caleis. And
because their goyng forward should be called of slaunderous tongues
a runnyng or fliyng awaie, it was decreed that the whole armie should
passe the next waie by lande through the middest of their enemies, and
yet that iouruey was adiudged perilous by reason that the numbre
was muche minished by the flyxe and other feuers, whiche sore vexed
and brought to deth aboue .xv.C. persones, whiche was the very cause
that the returne was soner concluded and apoincted: but before his departyng
he entered into the toune of Harflew and went on foote to the
churche of sainct Martynes and there offered. And all the men of warr
whiche had not paied their raunsome, he sware them on the holy Euangelistes
to yeld themselfes prisoners at Caleis by the fea
                     ••
                   of S. Martyn
in Nouember nexte, diuerse of the burgesses he highly raunsomed,
and a greate part of the women and children he expelled the toune, geuyng
to euery poore creature fiue sowse. The priestes had licence to depart
leuyng behinde them their substaunce. The goodes in the toune
wer innumerable whiche wer al praie to the Englishemen, whiche sent
the best into Englande as a remembraunce of good lucke. There were
twoo strong toures standyng on the hauen side, whiche lokyng for aid
did not yelde ten daies after the toune was rendered.
               
                  VVHEN the kyng had repaired the walles, fortefied the bulwarkes
refresshed the rampiers and furnished the toune with vitail and artillary,
he remoued from Harflew toward Pountoyse, entendyng to pas
the riuer of Some with his armie before the bridges were ether withdrawen
or broken. The Frenche kyng hearyng that the toune of Harfflewe
was gotten and that the kyng of Englande was marchyng forwarde
into the bowelles of the realme, sente out proclamacions and

assembled people in euery quarter, comittyng the whole charge of his
armie to his sonne the Dolphin &amp; the duke of Aquitayn, whiche incontinent
caused the bridges to be broken and all the passages to be defended,
beside that thei caused all corne and other vitaill to be destroied in
all places where thei coniectured that thenglishmen would repaire or
passe through, to thentent that thei might ether kepe thē in a place certain
without any passage or departure, and so to destroye them at their
pleasures, or els to kepe theim in a straite without vitailes or comfort,
and so by famyne ether cause them to dye or yelde.
               
                  THE kyng of Englande afflicted withall these incōmoditees at one
tyme was nether dismaied nor discoraged, but keping furth his iorney
approched to the riuer of Some, where he perceiued that all the bridges
wer by his enemies broken and vnframed: wherfore he came to the
passage called Blanchetaque where kyng Edwardes greate graundfather
passed the riuer of Some before the battaill of Cressy. But the
passage was so kepte that he could not passe without greate daunger,
consideryng that his enemies wer at his backe &amp; before his face. Wherfore
he passed forward to Arannes, burnyng villages &amp; takyng greate
booties, and euery daie he sente his light horsemen abrode to spye and
seke what perilles ther wer at hand, what embushmentes ther wer laid
on the one side or thother, &amp; to find out where he might most sauely pas
the riuer. The espialles returned and declared for a truth that the coū
                  tree
swarmed with men of warre, wherof he beyng aduertised, set furth
in good ordre, kepyng still his waie forwarde and so ordred his armie
and placed his cariage, that hauyng his enemies on both sides of him,
he passed so terribly that his enemies wer afraid once to offre hym battaill,
and yet the lorde Delabreth Constable of Fraunce, the Marshall
Bonceqault, the erle of Uandosme greate Master of Fraunce and the
lorde Dampier Admirall of Fraunce, the duke of Alanson and the erle
of Richemonde withall the puyssance of the Dolphin laie at Abbeuile
and durste not once touche his battailles, but euer kepte the passages
and coasted alofe like a hauke that liketh not her praie. The kyng of
Englande still kept on his iourney till he came to the bridge of saincte
Maxence, where he founde aboue .xxx.M. Frenchemen and there pitched
his felde, lokyng surely to be set on and fought withal. Wherfore
to encorage his capitaines the more, he dubbed certain of his hardy &amp;
valeant gentlemen knightes, as Ihō lord Ferreis of Groby, Reignold
of Greistocke, Piers Tempest, Christopher Morisby, Thomas Pikering,
Williā Huddleston, Ihon Hosbalton, Henry Mortimer, Philip
Halle &amp; Williā his brother, &amp; Iaques de Ormōd &amp; diuerse other. But
when he saw ye the Frenchmen made no semblance to fight, he departed
in good ordre of battail by the toune of Amiēce to a toune nere to a castle
called Bowes, and there laie twoo daies, euery houre lookyng for
battaill. And from thence he came nere to Corby where he was staied
that night by reason that the comē people and peysantz of the countree

assembled in greate nombre, and the men of Armes of the garrison of
Corby skirmished with his armie in the mornyng, whiche tariyng was
to hym bothe ioyous and proffitable, for there he discomfited the crew
of horsmen &amp; draue the rustical people euen to their gates, &amp; also found
there thesame daie a shalow forde betwene Corby &amp; Peron, whiche neuer
was espied before. At the whiche he, his armie &amp; cariages the night
ensuyng passed the greate riuer of Some without let or daungier, the
morowe after sainct Lukes daie, determined withall diligence to passe
to Caleis, and not to seke for battail except he wer therto constrained &amp;
compelled, because that his armie by sickenesse was sore minished and
appaired, for he had onely two .M. horsemen and .xiij.M. Archers, bill
men and of all sortes. The Englishemen were afflicted in this iourney
with an hundred discomodities, for their vitaile was in maner all spēt,
and newe thei could gette none, for their enemies had destroyed all the
corne before their comyng: Rest thei could take none, for their enemies
wer euer at hande, daily it reined and nightly it fresed, of fuell was skacenes
and of fluxes was plenty, money thei had ynough but comforte
thei had none. And yet in this great necessitee the poore folkes wer not
spoyled nor any thyng without paiment was of thē extorted, nor great
offence was doen except one, whiche was that a foolishe souldier stale
a pixe out of a churche and vnreuerently did eate the holy hostes within
thesame conteigned. For whiche cause he was apprehended, and the
kyng would not once remoue till the vessel was restored &amp; the offender
strangled. The people of the countrees there aboute hearyng of his
straight iustice &amp; godly mynd, ministered to hym bothe vitailes &amp; other
necessaries, although by open proclamaciō thei wer therof prohibited.
               
                  THE Frenche kyng beyng at Roan, hearyng that the kyng of Englande
was passed the water of Some, was not a litle discontente, and
assembled his counsaill to the numbre of .xxxv. to consult what should
be doen, the chief wherof were the Dolphin his sonne whose name was
Lewes, callyng hymself kyng of Cicile, the dukes of Berry &amp; Britayn
therle of Pontieu the kynges yongest sonne and diuerse other, wherof
xxx. agreed that the Englishmen should not departe vnfoughten with
all, and fiue▪ wer of the contrary opinion, but the greater numbre ruled
the matter. And so Mountioye kyng at Armes was sent to the kyng of
Englande to defie hym as the enemie of Fraunce, and to tell hym that
he should shortly haue battaill. Kyng Henry soberly aunswered: Sir
myne entent and desire is none other, but to do as it pleaseth almighty
God and as it becometh me, for surely I will not seke your Master at
this time, but if he or his seke me I wil willyngly fight with hym. And
if any of your nacion attempt once to stoppe me in my iourney toward
Caleis, at their ieoperdy be it, and yet my desire is that none of you be
so vnaduised or harebrained as to be the occasion that I in my defence
shall coloure and make redde your tawny grounde with the deathes
of your selfes and theffusion of Christen bloud. When he had aunswered

the harauld, he gaue to him a great reward &amp; licēced him to depart
               
                  VVHEN the Lordes of Fraunce heard the kyng of Englandes answere,
it was incontinent proclaymed, that all men of warre should resorte
to the Constable of Fraunce to fight with the kyng of Englande
and his puissaunce. Wherupon all men accustomed to beare Arinure
and desirous to wyn honor through the realme of Fraunce drewe toward
the feld. The Dolphyn sore desired to bee at that battaile, but he
was prohibited by the kyng his father, likewise Philip erle of Charolous
sonne to the Duke of Burgoyn would gladly haue been at that
noble assemble if the duke his father would haue suffred hym, but many
of his men stale awaie and went to the Frenchemen.
               
                  THE Kyng of Englande informed by his espialles that the daie of
battaill was nerer then he loked for, dislodged from Bomyers &amp; roade
in good arraie through the faire plaine beside the toune of Blangy,
where to the intent that his armie should not bee included in a streight
or driuen to a corner, he chose a place mete and conueniente for twoo
armies to darrayne battail betwene the tounes of Blangy and Agincourte,
where he pight his felde.
               
                  THE Constable of Fraunce, the Marshall, the Admirall, the Lorde
Rambures Master of the Crossebowes and diuerse lordes and knightes
pitched their banners nere to the banner royall of the Constable in
the Countee of sainct Paule within the territory of Agincourte, by the
whiche waie the Englishemen muste nedes passe towarde Caleis. The
Frenchemen made greate fires aboute their banners, and thei wer in
numbre had .lx.M. horsemen, as their owne historians and writers affirme,
beside footemen pages and wagoners, and all that night made
greate chere and wer very mery. The Englishmen that night sounded
their trompettes and diuerse instrumentes Musicall with greate melody,
and yet thei were bothe hungery, wery, sore traueiled and muche
vexed with colde deseases: Howbeit thei made peace with God in confessyng
their synnes, requiryng hym of help and receiuyng the holy sacramente,
euery man encouragyng and determinyng clerely rather to
die then ether to yelde or flie.
               
                  NOVV approched the fortunate faire daie to the Englishemen and
the infest and vnlucky daie to the Frenche nobilitee,The battaile of Agincourt whiche was the
fiue and twenty daie of October in the yere of our Lorde Iesu Christe
a thousaude foure hundred and fiftene, beeyng then Fridaie and the
daie of Crispin and Crispinian. On the whiche daie in the mornyng,
the Frenche menne made thre battailes: In the Uaward wer eight
thousande Healmes of Knightes and Esquiers and foure thousande
Archers and fiftene hundred Crosebowes, whiche were guyded by
the Lorde Delabret Constable of Fraunce, hauyng with hym the
dukes of Orleaunce and Burbone, therles of Ewe and Richmond the
Marshall Bonciqualt and the Master of the Crosebowes, the Lorde
Dampier Admirall of Fraunce and other capitaines. And the erle of

Uandosme and other the kynges officers with .xvj.C. men of Armes
wer ordred for a wyng to that battail. And the other wyug was guided
by sir Guyshard Dolphyn and sir Clugnet of Brabant and sir Lewes
of Burbon with .viij.C. menne of Armes, of chosen and elect persones.
And to breake the shot of the Englishemen wer appoincted sir Guylliā
of Sauēsens with Hector and Philip his brethren. Ferry of Maylley
and Alen of Gaspanes with other .viij.C. men of Armes. In the midle
ward wer assigned as many persones or mo as wer in the formoste battaill,
and therof was the charge comitted to the dukes of Barr and Alenson,
therles of Neuers, Uawdemont, Blamoūt, Salynges, Graūtpree
and of Roussy. And in the rerewarde were all the other men of Armes,
guyded by the erles of Marle, Dampmartyne, Fawquenberge
and the Lorde of Lourrey Capitayne of Arde, who had with hym men
of the Frontiers of Bolonoys.
               
                  VVHEN these battailes were thus ordred, it was a glorious sight
to behold thē, and surely thei wer estemed to be in numbre sixe times as
many or more then was the whole compaigny of the Englishmen with
wagoners pages and all. Thus the Frenchmen wer euery man vnder
his banner only waityng for the blouddy blast of the terrible trompet,
and in this ordre thei continued restyng themselfes and reconcilyng euery
one to other for all old rancors and hatredes whiche had been betwene
theim, till the houre betwene .ix. and .x. of the daie. Duryng whiche
season, the Constable of Fraunce saied openly to the capitaynes in
effecte as foloweth.
               
                  FRENDES and companions in armes,The oracion of the Cōstable of Fraūce I cānot but bothe reioyce
and lament the chances &amp; fortunes of these two armies whiche I openly
se and behold with myne iyes here presente. I reioyce for the victorie
whiche I se at hand for our part, and I lamēt and sorow for the misery
and calamitee whiche I perceiue to approche to the otherside: For wee
cannot but be victours and triūphant conquerors, for who saw euer so
florisshyng an armie within any christian region, or suche a multitude
of valiaunt persones in one compaignie? Is not here the flower of the
Frenche nacion on barded horsses with sharpe speares and dedly weapons?
Are not here the bold Britons with fiery handgōnes and sharpe
swerdes? Se you not present the practised Pickardes with strong and
weightie Crossebowes? Beside these, we haue the fierce Brabanders &amp;
strong Almaines with long pykes and cuttyng slaughmesses. And on
the otherside is a smal handfull of pore Englishmen whiche are entred
into this region in hope of some gain or desire of proffite, whiche by reson
that their vitaill is cōsumed &amp; spent, are by daily famyn sore wekened,
consumed &amp; almost without spirites: for their force is clerly abated
and their strength vtterly decaied, so y• or the battailes shall ioyne thei
shalbe for very feblenes vāquished &amp; ouercom, &amp; in stede of men ye shal
fight with shadowes. For you must vnderstand, y• kepe an Englishmā
one moneth from his warme bed, fat befe and stale drynke, and let him

that season tast colde and suffre hunger, you then shal se his courage a
bated, his bodye waxe leane and bare, and euer desirous to returne
into his owne countrey. Experience now declareth this to be true, for
if famine had not pinched them, or colde wether had not nipped them
surely they would houe made their progresse farher into Fraunce, and
not by so many perilous passages retired towarde Calays. Suche
courage is in Englishmen when fayre wether and vitaile folow them,
and suche weaknes they haue when famine and cold vexe and trouble
them. Therfore nowe, it is no mastery to vanquishe and ouerthrowe
them, beyng both wery &amp; weake, for by reason of feblenes and faintnes
their weapones shal fal out of their handes when they profer to strike,
so that ye may no easelier kyll a poore shepe then destroye them beyng
alredy sicke &amp; hungerstaruen. But imagyn that thei wer lusty, strong
and couragious, and then ponder wisely the cause of their cōmyng hither,
and the meanyng of their enterprice: Fyrst their king a yong striplyng
(more mete for a tenice playe then a warlike campe), claimeth the
croune, scepter and souereigntie of the verye substance of the Frenche
nacion by battaile: then he and his entende to occupy this country, inhabite
this land, destroy our wiues and children, extinguishe our blud
and put our names in the blacke boke of obliuion. Wherfore remembre
wel, in what quarel can you better fight then for the tuiciō of your
natural countrey, the honor of your prince, the surety of your children
and the sauegard of your land and liues. If these causes do not encourage
you to fight, beholde before your eyes the tētes of your enemies,
with treasure, plate &amp; iewels wel stuffed and richely furnished, whiche
pray is surely yours if euery mā strike but one stroke, besyde the great
raunsomes whiche shalbe paied for riche capitaines and welthy prisoners,
whiche as surely shalbe yours as you now had them in your possession.
Yet this thyng I charge you withal, that in nowise the kyng
him selfe be killed, but by force or otherwise to be apprehēded &amp; taken
to the entent that with glorye &amp; triumphe we may conuey him openly
through the noble cytie of Paris to ou
                     •
                  e kyng and dolphyn as a testimony
of our victory &amp; witnes of our noble act. And of this thyng you
be sure, that fly they cannot, and to yelde to our fight, of necessitie they
shalbe compelled. Therfore good felowes take courage to you, the victory
is yours, the gaine is yours &amp; the honor is yours without great
laboure or muche losse.
               
                  KYNG Henry also like a leader &amp; not like one led, like a souereigne
and not like a souldior ordred his men for his most aduantage like an
expert capitaine and a couragious warirer. And fyrst he sent priuely
CC. archers into a low medowe whiche was nere to the forward of his
enemies, but seperate with a great diche, and were there commaunded
to kepe them selues close tyl thei had a token to them geuen to shote at
their aduersaries. Beside this, he appoincted a vawarde, of the which
he made capitayne Edward duke of Yorke whiche of a haute courage

had of the kyng required and obteined that office: and with him were
the lordes Beaumond, Wylloughby and Fanhope, and this battaile
was al archers. The middle ward was gouerned by the kyng him self
with his brother the duke of Gloucester, &amp; the erles Marshal, Oxford
and Suffolke, in the whiche wer al the strong bilmen, The duke of Exceter
vncle to the kyng led the rereward, whiche was mixed both with
archers &amp; bilmen. The horsemen like winges went on euery side of the
battaile. When the king had thus ordred his battaile, like a puissaunt
cōqueror without feare of his enemies, yet cōsidering the multitude of
them farre to excede the smal nombre of his people, doubtyng that
the Frenchemen would compasse and beset him aboute, and so fight
with him on euery side, to thentent to vāquish the power of the French
horsmen whiche might breake the ordre and arraye of his Archers, in
whom the whole force of the battaile did consist and in maner remaine
he caused stakesbound with yron sharpe at both endes of the length of
v. or .vi. fote, to be pitched before the Archers and of euery side the fote
men like an hedge, to the entent that if the barde horses ranne rashely
vpō them, they might shortely be gored and destroied, &amp; appointed certaine
persons to remoue the stakes when the Archers moued, and as
tyme required: so that the fotemen were hedged about with the stakes,
and the horsemen stode like a bulwerke betwene thē and their enemies
without the stakes. This deuice of fortifiyng an armye was at this
tyme fyrst inuented, but sence that tyme, they haue imagined caltrappes,
harowes and other new trickes to defende the force of the horsmen
so that if the enemies at auenture runne against their engines, either
sodeinly their horses be wounded with the stakes, or their feete hurt
with the other engines, so that of very necessitie for paine, the sely pore
beastes are compelled to fal and tumble to the ground. When he had
ordred thus his battailes, he left a smal company to kepe his campe &amp;
baggage, and then callyng his capitaines and soldiours about him,
he made to thē an heartie Oracion in effect as foloweth, saiyng.
               
                  VVELBELOVED frendes and countrymen,The oracion of kyng Henry the fift. I exhort you heartely
to thinke and conceiue in your selues that this daye shalbe to vs all
a day of ioy, a day of good lucke and a day of victory: For truely if you
well note and wisely considre all thinges, almighty God vnder whose
protection we be come hither, hath appoincted a place so mete and apt
for our purpose as we our selues could nether haue deuised nor wished
whiche as it is apt and conuenient for our smal nombre and litle army
so is it vnprofitable and vnmete 
                     •
                  or a great multitude to fight or geue
batttaile in: and in especial for suche men in whom is neither constant
faith nor securitie of promise, whiche persons be of God neither fauored
nor regarded, nor he is not accustomed to ayde and succoure suche
people whiche by force and strength contrary to right &amp; reason detain
and kepe from other their iust patrimony and lauful inheritance, with
whiche blotte and spotte the Frenche nacion is apparantly defyled

and distained: so that God of his iustice wyll scourge and aflicte them
for their manifest iniuries and open wronges to vs and oure realme
dayly committed and done. Therfore puttyng your onely trust in
him, let not their multitude feare youre heartes, nor their great nombre
abate your courages: for surely old warlike fathers haue both said
and written that the more people that an army is, the lesse knowledge
the multitude hath of material feates or politique practises, whiche
rude rustical and ignorant persons shalbe in the feld vnto hardy capitaines
and lusty men of warre a great let and sore impediment. And
though they al were of like pollicy, like audacitie and of one vniforme
experience in marcial affayres, yet we ought neither to feare them nor
once to shrinke for them, consideryng that we come in the right, whiche
euer of God is fauored, set furth and auansed: in whiche good and iust
quarel al good persons shal rather set bothe theyr feete forwarde, then
once to turne theyr one heale backward. For if you aduenture your
liues in so iust a battaile &amp; so good a cause, whiche way soeuer fortune
turne her whele, you shalbe sure of fame, glory and renoune: If you be
victors and ouercome your enemies, your strength and vertue shalbe
spred and dispersed through the whole world: If you ouerpressed with
so great a multitude shal happē to be slaine or taken, yet neither reproche
can be to you ascribed, either yet infamy of you reported, consideryng
that Hercules alone was not equiuolent vnto .ii. men, nor a smal
handfull is not equal to a great nombre, for victory is the gift of God
and consisteth not in the puissaunce of men. Wherfore manfully set on
your enemies at theyr fyrst encountre, strike with a hardy courage on
the false hearted Frenchemen, whom youre noble auncestours haue
so often ouercome and vanquished. For surely they be not so strong to
geue the onset vpō you, but thei be much weaker to abide your strēgth
in a long fight and tyred battaile. As for me I assure you al, that England
for my person shal neuer paye raunsome, nor neuer Frencheman
shal triumph ouer me as his capitain, for this day by famous death or
glorious victory I wyl wynne honor and obtaine fame. Therfore now
ioyously prepare your selues to the battaile and couragiously fight
with your enemies, for at this very tyme all the realme of Englande
praieth for our good lucke and prosperous successe.
               
                  VVHILE the kyng was thus speakyng, eche armye so maligned &amp;
grudged at the other beyng in open fight and euident apparence, that
euery man cried furth, furth, forward forward. The dukes of Clarēce,
Gloucester and Yorke were of the same opinion, thinkyng it most conuenient
to marche toward theyr enemies with al spede &amp; celeritie, least
in prolongyng of tyme and arguyng of opinions, the Frenche armye
might more and more increace &amp; hourly multiply. Howbeit, the kyng
taried a while least any ieopardy were not forsene, or any hazard not
preuented.
               
                  THE Frenchemen in the meane season litle or nothyng regardyng

the small nombre of thenglishe nacion, were of suche haute courage
aud proud stomackes that they toke no thought for the battaile, as
who saye they were victours and ouercomers before any stroke was
striken, and laughed at the Englishmen, and for very prid thought thē
selues lifted into heauen iestyng and boastyng that they had thenglish
men inclosed in a straight, and had ouercome and takē them without
any resistence. The capitaines determined howe to deuide the spoyle:
the souldiors plaied the Englishmen at dice: the noble men deuised a
chariot how they might triumphantly conueigh kyng Henrye beyng
captiue to the cytie of Paris, criyng to theyr souldiors, hast your selues
to obtaine spoile, glory and honor, to thentent that we may study
howe to geue you thankes for the great giftes and rewardes whiche
we hope to receiue of your great liberalitie. The folishe folye of this
vaine solace brake out so farre, that messengers were sent to the cyties
and tounes adioynyng, willyng them to make open playes and triumphes,
(as though that the victory were to them certaine &amp; no resistance
could appeare) and also to geue God thankes for their prosperous act
and notable dede, not remembryng that the whirlewynd shortely with
a puffe blew away al their folishe ioy and phantastical braggyng.
               Of this doyng you may gather, that it is asmuche madnes to make a
determinate iudgement of thinges to come, as it is wisdome to doubt
what wyl folowe of thinges begōne. I may not forget how the Frēchemen
beyng in this pleasaunt pastyme, sent a herault to kyng Henry to
inquyre what raunsome he wold offre, and how he answered that within
.ii. or .iii. houres he hoped that it should so happen that the Frenchemen
should cōmen rather with thenglishmen how to be redemed, then
the Englishmen should take thought how to pay any raūsome or money
for theyr deliuerance: asserteinyng them for him selfe that his dead
carion should rather be their pray, then his liuyng body should pay any
raunsome. When the messenger was departed, the Frenchmen put
on theyr healmettes and set thē in ordre vnder theyr banners, richely
armed and gorgeously trapped, and caused theyr trumpettes to blowe
to the battaile.
               
                  THE Englishemen perceiuyng that, sette a lytle forwarde, before
whom there went an old knight called syr Thomas of Herpingham, a
man of great experience in warre, with a warder in his hand, and when
he cast vp his warder al the army shouted, at the which the Frenchmen
muche marueiled, but that was a signe to the Archers in the medowe,
which knowing the token, shot wholy altogether at the vaward of the
Frenchmen. When they perceiued the archers in the medow, whō they
saw not before, and sawe they could not come to them for a ditche, they
with al hast set on kyng Henries forwarde, but or they ioyned, the archers
in the forfront and the archers on the side whiche stode in the medow,
so wounded the fotemen, so galled the horses and so combred the
men of armes that the fotemen durst not go forward, the horsmen rāne

in plumpes without ordre, some ouerthrew his felow, and horses ouerthrew
their maisters: So at the fyrst ioynyng, as the Frenchemen wer
clearely discouraged, so thenglishmen were muche chered. When the
Frenche vaward was thus discomfited, the English archers cast away
theyr bowes &amp; toke into theyr handes axes, malles and swordes, billes
and other weapons, and therwith slewe the Frenchmen tyll they came
to the middleward. Then the king approched and encoraged his souldiors,
that shortly the second battaile was ouerthrowen and dispersed
not without great slaughter of men: howbeit diuers beyng wounded
wer releued by theyr varlettes and conueighed out of the felde, for the
Englishmen so sore labored with fightyng and slaiyng, and wer so busy
in takyng of prisoners that they folowed no chace, nor would once
breake out of the battaile. The Frenchmen strongly westode the fearcenes
of Thenglishmen when thei came to hādy strokes, so that the fight
was very doubtful &amp; perilous. And when one part of the Frenchhorse
men thought to haue entred into the kynges battaile, they were with
the stakes ouerturned, and either slaine or taken.
               
                  THVS this battaile continued .iii. long houres, some strake, some
defēded, some foyned, some trauersed, some kylled, some toke prisoners
noman was idle, euery man fought either in hope of victory or glad to
saue him selfe. The kyng that day shewed him selfe like a valiaunt
knight, whiche notwithstandyng that he was almost felled with the
duke of Alaunson, yet with plain strength he slew .ii. of the dukes company
and felled the duke: but when the duke would haue yelded him,
the kynges garde cōtrary to the kynges minde outragiously slew him
And inconclusion, mindyng to make an ende of that daies iorney, caused
his horsmen to fetch a compasse about &amp; to ioyne with him against
the rereward of Fraunce: in the whiche battaile were the greatest nombre
of people. When the Frenchmen perceiued his entent, they wer sodenly
amased and ranne away like shepe without aray or ordre.
               When the kyng perceiued the banners cast doune &amp; the aray was clerely
broken, he encoraged his souldiors and folowed so quickely that the
Frenchmen trunyng to flight, ranne hither and thither not knowyng
whiche way to take, castyng away theyr armure and on theyr knes desired
to haue theyr liues saued. In the meane season while the battaile
thus continued and that thenglishmen had taken a great nōbre of prisoners,
certain Frenchmen on horsbacke wherof were captaines Robinet
of Borneuile, Rifflart of Clamas and Isambert of Agincourt and
other men of Armes to the nombre of .vi.C. horsemen: whiche fled fyrst
from the felde at theyr fyrst commyng, and hearyng that the Englishe
tentes and pauilions were farre from the army without any great nō
                  bre
of kepers or persons mete and cōuenient for defence, partly moued
and styrred with coueteous desire of spoyle and pray, and partly entendyng
by some notable act to reuenge the damage and displeasure done
to them &amp; theirs in battail the same day, entred into the kynges campe

beyng voide of men and fortefied with varlettes &amp; lackeys, and ther
spoyled hales, robbed tentes, brake vp chestes and caried awaye caskettes
and slewe suche seruantes as they could fynd in the tentes and
pauilions. For the whiche act thei wer long imprisoned and sore punished
and like to haue lost their liues if the Dolphyn had longer liued.
               
                  VVHEN the kyng by a fearefu
                     •
                   messenger was of this euil acte sodainly
aduertiled, and when the outcry of the lackeys and boyes whiche
rāne away for feare of the robbers was heard into the felde, saiyng
that the Frenchmen had robbed al the the tentes and lodgynges of the
Englishmen, he fearyng least his enemies beyng dispersed and scattered
abroade should gather together againe and begynne a new felde:
and doubtyng farther that the prisoners would ether be an aide to his
enemies or very enemies to him if he should suffre them to liue, contrary
to his accustomed gentlenes and pitie he cōmaunded by the sounde
of a trompet that euery man vpon paine of death should incōtinently
sley his prisoner. When this dolorous decre &amp; pitiful proclamaciō was
pronounced, pitie it was to se and lothsome it was to behold how some
Frenchmen wer sodainly sticked with daggers, some wer brained with
polaxes, some were slaine with malles, other had theyr throtes cut and
some their bellies paunched: so that in effecte hauyng respecte to the
great nombre, few prisoners or none were saued.
               
                  VVHEN this lamentable manslaughter was finished, thenglishemen
forgettyng their woundes and huries and not remembring what
paine thei had sustained al day in fightyng with their enemies, as men
that wer freshe and lusty, ranged them selues again in aray both prest
and redy to abide a newe felde, and also to inuade and newly to set on
theyr enemies, and so couragiously thei set on the earles of Maile and
Fauconbrige and the lordes of Louray &amp; of Thyne, whiche with viC.
men of armes had al day kept together and slew them out of hand.
               When the kyng had passed through the felde &amp; saw neither resistence
nor apparaunce of any Frenchmen 
                     •
                  auyng the dead corsses, he caused
the retrayte to be blowen and brought al his army together about iiii.
of the clocke at after noone. And fyrst to geue thankes to almightie
God geuer &amp; tri
                     •
                  utor of this glorious victory, he caused his prelates
&amp; chapelaines fyrst to sing this psalme In exitu Israel de Egipto▪ &amp;c. commaundyng
euery man to knele doune on the ground at this verse.
               
                  Non nobis domine, non nobis, sed nomini tuo da gloriam, whiche is to say in
Englishe, Not to vs lord, not to vs, but to thy name let the glory be geuen:
whiche done he caused Te deum with certaine anthemes to be song
geuyng laudes and praisynges to God, and not boastyng nor braggyng
of him selfe nor his humaine power.
               
                  THAT night he toke refreshyng of suche as he found in the Frēche
campe, and in the mornyng Moūtioy kyng at armes and .iiii. Heraultes
came to him to know the nombre of prisoners and to desire buriall
for them whiche were slaine. Before he could make any answere to the

Heraultes, he remembryng that it is more honorable to bee praised of
his enemies then to be extolled of his frendes: and he that praiseth him
self lacketh louyng neighbors: wherfore he demaunded of thē why thei
made to hym that request, considryng that he knew not certainly whether
the praise &amp; the victory wer mete to be attributed to him or to their
nacion. Oh lorde ꝙ Mountioy kyng at armes, thinke you vs officers
of armes to be rude and beastial persones? If we for the affe
                     •
                  cion that
we beare to our naturall countrey, would ether for fauor or mede hide
or deny your glorious victory: The foules of the aire, the wormes of
the ground fedyng on the multitude of the ded carions, by your onely
puyssaunce destroyed and confounded, will beare witnesse against vs,
ye and muche more the captiues whiche be liuing and in your possessiō
with their wiues and litle infauntes will saie wee bee open liers and
vntrue taletellers: Wherfore accordyng to the duety of our office whiche
is or should bee alwaies indifferently to write and truely to iudge,
we saie, determyne and affirme that the victory is yours, the honor is
yours and yours is the glory, aduisyng you, as you haue manfully
gotten it, so polletikely to vse it. Well saied the kyng, seeyng this is
your determinacion, I willyngly accepte thesame, desiryng you to
know the name of the castle nere adioynyng. When thei had answered
that it was called Agyncourt, he said that this conflict should be called
the battaill of Agyncourt, whiche victory hath not been obteigned by
vs nor our power, but only by the suffraunce of GOD for iniury and
vntruth that we haue receiued at the handes of your Prince and his
nacion. That daie he feasted the French officers of Armes and graunted
to theim their request, whiche busely sought through the felde for
suche as were slain, but the Englishemen suffred them not to go alone
for thei serched with them and found many hurt but not in ieoperdy of
their life, whom thei toke prisoners and brought them into their tētes.
               
                  VVHEN the kyng of Englande had wel refreshed hymself and his
souldiours and had taken the spoyle of suche as were slain, he with his
prisoners in good ordre returned to his toune of Caleis. When tidynges
of this notable victory was blowen into Englande, solempne processions
and other praisynges to almightie GOD, with bonefiers and
dances wer ordeined in euery toune, citee and borough, and the Maire
and the citezens of the citee of London went the morowe after the daie
of sainct Simon and Iude from the Churche of Sainct Paule to the
church of S. Peter at Westminster in deuou
                     •
                  e maner, rēdryng to God
their moste humble and hertie thankes for his haboundant grace and
fortunate lucke geuen and sent to the kyng their souereigne lorde.
               
                  VVHEN the kyng of Englande was departed the sondaie toward
Caleis, diuerse Frēchmen repaired to the plain where the battaill was
and remoued again the ded bodies, some to finde their lordes and masters
and theim to conueigh into their countrees there to bee buried,
some to spoyle and take the reliques whiche the Englishemen had left

behynde: For thei toke nothyng but gold, siluer, iuelles, riche apparell
and costly armure. But the ploughmen and peysantes spoyled the ded
carkasses, leuyng theim nether sherte nor cloute, and so thei laie starke
naked till Wednesdaie. On the whiche daie diuerse of the noble men
wer conueighed into their countrees and the remnant were by Philip
erle Charoloys (sore lamentyng the chaunce and moued with pitee) at
his cost and charge buried in a square plot of .xv.C. yardes, in the whiche
he caused to be made thre pittes, wherin wer buried by accompt .v.M.
and viii.C. persons beside them that wer caried awaie by their frē
                  des
and seruauntes, and other whiche beyng wounded to death died in
Hospitalles and other places, whiche groue after was made a churche
yarde, and for feare of Wolues enclosed with a high walle.
               
                  AFTER this dolorus iorney and piteous slaughter, diuerse clerckes
of Paris made many lamentable Uerses, complainyng that the
kyng reigned by will, and that coūsaillers wer perciall, affirmyng that
the noble men fled against nature, and that the comons were destroyed
by their prodigalite, declaring also that the clergy wer dōbe and durst
not saie the truth, and that the humble comons duely obeyed and yet euer
suffred ponishement: For whiche cause by persecucion deuine, the
lesse numbre vanquished, and the great was ouercome. Wherfore thei
concluded that al thynges was out of ordre, and yet there was no man
that studied to bryng the vnruly to frame. And no meruel though this
battaill were dolorus and lamentable to the Frenche nacion, for in it
were taken and slayn the flower of all the nobilite of Fraunce, for there
wer taken prisoners.

thousande persones wherof wer princes and nobles bearyng banners

not aboue .xxv. if you wil geue credite to 
                     •
                  uche as write miracles:
but other writers whom I soner beleue, affirme that there was slain aboue
v. or vj.C. persons, whiche is not vnlike, considryng y• the battail
was earnestly and furiously fought by the space of three long houres
wherfore it is not incredible nor yet vnpossible but more Englishmen
then fiue and twenty were slain and destroyed.
               
                  THIS battail maie be a mirror and glasse to al Christian princes to
beholde and folowe, for kyng Henry nether trusted in the puissaunce of
his people, nor in the fortitude of his champions, nor in the strength of
his barded horsses, nor yet in his owne pollicy, but he putte in GOD
(whiche is the corner stone and immouable rocke) his whole cōfidence
hope &amp; trust. And he which neuer leaueth them destitru
                     •
                  e that put their
confidence in hym, sent to hym this glorious victory, whiche victory is
almoste incredible if we had not 
                     •
                  edde in the boke of kynges that God
likewise had defended and aided them that onely put their trust in him

and committed them selfes wholy to his gouernaunce.
               
                  AFTER that the kyng of Englande had refreshed hymself and his
souldiours in the toune of Caleis, and that suche prisoners as he had
left at Harfflew (as you haue heard) wer come to hym to Caleis: the .vi
daie of Nouembre he with all his prisoners toke shippyng at Caleis,
and thesame daie landed at Douer, hauyng with hym the ded bodies
of the duke of Yorke and the erle of Suffolke, and caused the duke to
bee buried at his colledge of Fodrynghey, and therle at Ewhelme. In
this passage the seas were so rough and troubleous that two shippes
laden with souldiers apperteignyng to sir Ihon Cornewal lorde Fanhope,
wer driuen into zelande, howbeit nothyng was loste nor no person
was perished. The kyng by soft iorneies with al his prisoners cam
to London and so to Westminster, where he rested hymself a conueniēt
tyme to deliuer his prisoners to their kepers, and to se them all in saue
custody. Here I might declare vnto you if I would bee tedious and
prolixe, how the Mayre of London and the Senate appareled in oriēt
grayned Skarlet, how .iij.C. comoners clad in beautiful Murrey wel
mounted and gorgeously horsed with riche collers and greate chaynes
met the kyng at Blackhethe, reioysyng at his victorius returne. How
the clergie of London with riche crosses, sūpteous copes &amp; massy cēsers
receiued hym at .s. Thomas of Wateryng with solēpne procession laudyng
and praisyng God for the high honor and victory to hym geuen &amp;
graunted: but all these thynges I omit and returne to the very matter.
               
                  VVHEN the dolorus tidynges of this bloudy battaill was declared
to the Frenche kyng beeyng then at Roan, and with hym the Dolphyn,
the dukes of Berry and Briteyne and his second sonne therle of
Ponthew, if he lamented this chaunce and cursed that euill daie in the
whiche he lost so many noble men, no man haue maruaill. And yet the
dolor was not onely his, for the ladies souned for the deathes of their
husebandes, the Orphalines wept and rent their heares for the losse of
their parentes, the faire damoselles defied that daie in the whiche thei
had lost their paramors, the seruātes waxed mad for destrucciō of their
masters, and finally, euery frend for his frend, euery cosyn for his alye,
euery neighbor for his neighbor, was sory, displeased &amp; greued. Wherfore
the Frenche kyng and his counsaill preceiuyng that the war was
but newly begon, and that towarde them with euill spede, determined
to prouide for chances that might folowe, and to forsee thynges or thei
sodainly happened. And first he elected his chief officer for the warres
called the Constable, whiche was therle of Arminack, a wise and a pollitique
capitain and an auncient enemy to thenglishmen, and sir Ihon
of Corsey was made Master of the Crosbowes, and then thei fortefied
tounes &amp; furnished garrisons. While these thynges were thus in workyng,
ether for Malencoly that he had for the losse at Agincourt or by
some sodein desease, Ihon Dolphyn of Uienoys heire apparaunte to
Charles the Frenche kyng departed out of this naturall life without

issue, whiche was an happy chaunce for Robynet of Bournouile and
his compaignions as you haue heard before, for his death was their
life, and his life would haue been their death.
            
            
               ¶The fourth yere.The .iiii. yere
               
               
                  AFter this notable victory obteigned by the Englishmen
and that kyng Henry was departed into Englande, and
the Frenche kyng had made newe officers in hope to releue
and sette vp again the olde estate of his realme and
coūtrie. Thomas duke of Excester capitain of Harflew
accompaignied with thre .M. Englishmen made a great
roade into Normandy, almoste to the citee of Roan: In whiche iorney
he gat great habundance bothe of riches and prisoners. But in his returne
therle of Arminacke newly made Conestable of Fraunce, entendyng
in his first iorney to wynne his spurres, and in his compaignie aboue
.v.M. horssemen, encountred with hym. The skirmishe was sore
and the fight fierce, but because the Englishemen wer not able to resist
the force of the Frenche horsemen, the duke to saue his men was compelled
to retire, as pollitiquely as he could deuise: But for all that he
could do, he lost almoste .ccc. of his fotemen. The Frenchmen not contēt
with this good lucke folowed theim almoste to the Barriers of Harflew.
When the Englishemen within the toune espied the chace, thei issued
out in good ordre and met with their enemies, and not onely slew
and toke a greate numbre of theim, but also chaced them aboue eighte
miles toward the citee of Roan.
               
                  ABOVTE this ceason Sigismond Emperor of Almayn whiche had
maried Barbara doughter to therle of zilie cosyn germain remoued to
kyng Henry (as by the pedegre set out in the end of this boke you shall
plainly perceiue) a man of greate vertue and fidelitie, whiche had not
onely long labored to set an vnitee and cōcord in Christes churche and
christian religiō, but also he sent diuerse Ambassadors aswel to ye Frēch
kyng as to the kyng of Englande, because he was farre distaunt from
their countries and regions to encrease perfight peace and reasonable
vnitie. Wherfore, seyng that his Ambassade brought nothyng to conclusion,
he in person came frō the farthest part of Hūgary into Fraūce
and after into Englande, intendyng to knit together all christen princes
in one line and amitee, and so beyng frendes together, to make war
and reuenge their quarelles against the Turke the persecutor of Christes
faithe and enemie to all christendome. With this noble Emperor
came the Archebishop of Reynes and diuerse other noble men, as Ambassadors
frō the Frenche kyng into England. The kyng of England
for old amitee betwene the hous of Englande and Beame, withall his
nobilitee hym receiued on Blackheth the .vii. daie of Maie, &amp; brought
hym through London to Westminster with greate triumphe, where
Iustes, tournayes and other marciall feates wer to hym with all ioye

and pleasure shewed and set furth. Duryng whiche tyme there came in
to Englande Albert duke of Hollande, whiche also was frendly entreteigned.
And these two princes wer by the kyng conueighed to Wynsore
to. S. Georges feast, and elected compaignions of the noble ordre
of the Garter, and had the color and habite of thesame to theim deliuered,
and satte in their stalles al the solempnitee of the feast: by the whiche
ordre thei knowledged themselfes highly honored and muche exalted.
After this solempne feast finished, the duke of Holland wel feasted
and greatly rewarded, returned into his countrie. But themperor taried
stil, neuer ceasyng to declare &amp; perswade what vtilitee, what goodnes
and what ioye might ensue if bothe the realmes of Englande and
Fraunce wer brought to a finall concord and perfight vnitee. But the
euill chaunce of the Frenche nacion was to his purpose a barre and a
lette, because thei were predestinate to suffre yet more plagues and
detrimentes of thenglishe people then before thei had tasted. For when
concorde was at hande and peace was enteryng into the gates, a newe
cause of more discord and dissencion sodainly brake out and cam to the
kynges knowledge: for he beyng informed of the losse of his mē at the
conflict late had in the territory of Roan (as you haue heard) was so
displeased and vnquieted that he would heare of no treaty, nor haue
once this woorde peace named.
               
                  THE Emperor like a wise prince, seyng then the aspect of the planet
reigned contrary to his purpose, ceassed to talke of that matter any
more till another daie when the coniūccion should be in more meker signes
stirryng to peace. And so when a mete &amp; conueniēt tyme came, he
broched again the vessell of cōcord and amitee, &amp; put it in so faire a cup
and presented it with suche pleasant wordes, that surely the kyng had
tasted it sufficiently if ye Frenchmē had not sodainly prepared a new army.
For therle of Arminacke puffed vp with his last victory, although
the honor wer small and the gain lesse, determined clerely to get again
the toune of Harflewe, wherfore as closely as he could, he gathered together
men in euery part, and appoincted them all to mete at Harflew
at a daie assigned. The appoinctment was kept and the toune was besieged
bothe by water &amp; land before the capitaines of the toune knewe
perfightly the first mocion. For Ihon Uicount Narbon Uiceadmirall
of Fraunce had brought the whole nauy to the riuage and shore adioynyng
to the toune, entendyng priuely to haue entred into the toune on
the water side or he had been perceiued. But his subtile ymaginacion
toke no place, for thei which kept the watch toure, sodainly perceiuyng
their enemies to approche, rang the alarum bell. The duke of Excester
incontinent caused all his men to repaire to the walles, and fortified
the gates, and dispatched a swifte Barke to kyng Henry with letters,
requiryng hym of aide and succor. Although the Frenchemen perceiued
that their wyly enterprise was knowen, and that the toune
could not be taken and sodenly stollen as they had deuised, yet they cō
                  tinued

their siege both by water and by land, and made diuers assaultes,
at the whiche if they nothyng gained, yet euer somewhat they lost.
When these newes were come to the eares of kyng Henry, and that he
knew that his people were in great ieopardye excepte great diligence
were vsed for their relief and deliuerance, he without delay apparelled
a great nauy &amp; intended in person to minister succours to his subiectes
so besieged. The Emperor Sigismond sagely disuaded him and wisely
counsailed him not to aduenture him selfe in that iorney, but only to
send some valiant captain whiche shortly might appeace that furious
storme &amp; quickly quenche that blasyng flame: aduertisyng him that it
was neither necessary nor honorable for a prince in whom the whole
waight and charge of the cōmon welth consisteth, to aduenture &amp; hazard
him self in euery peril and doutful chaunce. The kyng beyng persuaded
with the reasonable and louyng aduertisment of his frende the
emperor, appoincted the duke of Bedforde his brother, accompanied
with therles of Marche, Marshal, Oxford, Huntyngdon, Warwicke,
Arundel, Salsbury, Deuonshyre, and diuers Barons with .CC. sayle
to passe into Normandy for reskew of the toune of Harflew. Whiche
makyng good expedicion shipped at Rye, and with a prosperous wind
and a freshe gale came to the mouth of the riuer of Seyn on the day of
the Assumpcion of our Lady. When the vicount Narbon perceiued
the Englishe nauy to approche, he geuyng a token to al his company,
coragiously set toward his enemies &amp; gate the possession of the mouth
of the hauen. When the duke of Bedford perceiued the nauy of his enemies
to come forward so fiersly, he set before certain strong and wel
made shippes, whiche at the fyrst encountre vanquished and toke two
Frenche shyppes (wherof the capitaines were rashe and somewhat to
bold) withal their souldiours and tackelyng. The duke folowed incō
                  tinently
with all his puissance and like a valiant capitaine with great
courage and audacitee, set on his enemies: the fight was long, but not
so long as perilous, nor so perilous as terrible, for battailes of the sea
be euer desperate, for neither the assailauntes nor defendantes loke for
any refuge, nor know any backdore how to skape out. After long fight
the victory fel to the Englishemen, and they toke and sonke almost all
the whole nauy of Fraunce, in the whiche were many shippes, hulkes
and carikes to the nombre of fiue hundred, of the whiche .iii. great carickes
were sent into England. In the same conflict were slaine of the
Frenchemen no small nombre, as it appeared by their bodies whiche
swarmed euery day about thenglishe shippes.
               
                  AFTER this victorye fortunately obteined, the duke of Bedforde
sailed by water vp to the very toune of Harflew, and without let or impediment
landed and refreshed it both with vitaile and money. Which
succours if they were welcome to the duke of Excetter his vncle, I reporte
me to them that haue bene in necessitie and would haue gladly
bene refreshed.
               
                  
                  VVHEN the earle of Armynacke heard that the puissaunt nauye of
Frau

                  ce was vanquished &amp; taken, he raised his siege before the toune
and returned with smal ioy to Paris, as he that had no hope nor sawe
any likelyhod or meane to recouer again the toune of Har
                     ••
                  ew for whiche
he so sore thirsted.
               
                  AFTER this discomfiture and great losse, the fortitude &amp; strēgth of
the Frēchmen began to decay, &amp; their braggyng beautie began to fade.
For nowe the princes &amp; nobles of the realme fel into diuision &amp; discord
among them selues, as who say, that the nobilitie studiyng howe to reuenge
their olde iniuries and displeasures, refused to take payne for
thaduauncement of the pulique wealth and sauegard of their country
And for priuy displeasure couert or hatred, their power began to wexe
so slender, &amp; their libertie was brought into suche a malicious diuersitie
and doubtful difference, that as herafter shalbe shewed, it was merueil
that their coūtrey was not brought to a perpetual bondage: whiche
thing no doubt had folowed if kyng Henry had lenger liued in this
mutable worlde. For notwithstandyng that the duke of 
                     ••
                  leaunce
the capitaine and head of the one faction was at that time captiue and
prisoner in England, yet there grewe so muche priuy dipleasure &amp; cankard
hatred betwene Charles the Dolphyn and Ihon duke of Burgoyne,
that while the one studied, compassed and deuised how to ouercome
the other with armure or with pollicy, with dissimulacion or crafty
cōueyaunce, euery iorneiman of their faction, &amp; euery noble mā partaker
with the one or the other, put all their whole study and diligence
to auance forward their sect and part, and not one of them would take
hede howe to re
                     •
                  ist and refell the present ieopardye whiche was commyng
out of Englād. And as one incōuenience suffred many to folow
so was it in Fraūce at this tyme, for the French kyng was not of good
memory, the war that was toward, semed both doubtful and perilous,
the princes were vntrusty and at discord, and an hundreth mo thinges
which might bryng the realme to exstreme misery and vtter distructiō
as after you shal heare.
               
                  VVHEN the duke of Bedford had acheued his enterprise and performed
his cōmission, bothe in raisyng the siege of Harflew and vitaylyng
of the toune, he with no smal nombre of prisoners and great haboundance
of pray as wel in shippes as prouision for the sea, 
                     〈◊〉
                  
into England with great triumph and glory. For that victory he was
not so muche thāked of the kyng his brother, as lauded and praised by
the Emperor Sigismond beyng to him a straunger, whiche sayd openly,
happy are those subiectes whiche haue suche a kyng, but more happy
is the kyng that hath suche subiectes.
               
                  VVHEN the Emperoure perceiued, that to moue farther a peace,
was but a vayne request, and to tarye lenger in Englande to procure
an amitie was but losse of tyme, because he sawe the Englishemens
myndes sore offended with the last siege of Harflew, with whiche facte,

he him selfe was not wel cōtent but greatly moued: Therfore leauyng
all treaty and persuasion, he entred into a league and amitie with the
kyng of England. Whiche confederacy least it shuld be broken, euery
of the contractors studyed &amp; deuised all waies &amp; meanes possible howe
to obserue it vnuiolated and preserue it vnbroken: whiche plain meanyng
&amp; true dealyng was to thē both after, not only muche honor but
great cōmoditie. When the Emperor had thus cōcluded a league with
the kyng of England and had done al thinges in England accordyng
as was thought necessary, he toke his iorney homeward into Garmany,
and the kyng partely to shewe him pleasure, and partely because of
his owne affaires, associated him to his toune of Caleys. During whiche
tyme the duke of Burgoyn offred to come to Caleys to speake with
the Emperor and the kyng because he heard speake of the league and
confederacy that was concluded betwene them. The kyng sent to the
water of Grauelyng the duke of Gloucester his brother, and the ear
                     •
                  e
of Marche to be hostages for the duke of Burgoyne, and sent also the
earle of Warwicke with a noble company to cōduct him to his presēce
At Grauelyng foorde the dukes met, and after salutacions done, the
duke of Burgoyn was conueighed to Caleys, where of the Emperor &amp;
of the kyng he was highly feasted and welcommed. Duryng whiche
tyme a peace was concluded betwene the kyng of England &amp; the duke
of Burgoyn for a certain space, cōce
                     •
                  nyng onely the counties of Flaū
                  ders
and Arthoys, for the whiche cause the Frenche kyng and his sōne
were highly displeased. The duke of Gloucester also was receiued at
Grauelyng by the earle Charoloys sonne to the duke of Burgoyne, &amp;
by him honorably conueighed to S. Omers &amp; there lodged that night
The next day the earle Charoloys came with diuers noblemen to visite
the duke of Gloucester in his lodging, and when he entred into the
chambre the dukes backe was towarde him, talkyng with some of his
seruantes, and did not se nor welcome the earle Charoloys at the fyrst
entrey: but after he sayd to him shortly without any great reuerence or
cōmyng towarde him, you be welcome fayre cosyn, and so passed furth
his tale with his seruātes. The earle Charoloys for al his youth was
not wel content, but suffred for that tyme.
               
                  VVHEN the duke of Burgoyn had done al thinges at Caleys that
he came for, he after the .ix. day returned to Grauelyng, where the duke
of Gloucester and he met againe, and louyngly departed the one to Caleys
and the other to sainct Omers: for the whiche voiage the duke of
Burgoyn was suspected to be enemy to the croune of Fraunce. After
the dukes departyng the Emperor was highly feasted and rewarded,
and at his pleasure sailed into Holand, and so roade into Beame. The
kyng likewise toke ship and returned into England on sainct Lukes
euen, the yere of our Lord M.CCCC.xvii.
            
            
               
               ¶The fift yere.The .v. yere.
               
               
                  IN this yere the kyng assembled together his high courte
of Parliament and there in open audience made to them
a shorte and pithy Oracion, declaryng vnto them the iniuries
lately doone and committed by the Frenche nacion,
he shewyng also the iust and laufull occasion of his
warres, signifiyng furthermore the great discord and ciuile dissencion
whiche reigned amongest the nobilitie of Fraunce, rehersyng many
thynges for the whiche it were very necessary and nedeful to represse &amp;
ouercome them withal their power &amp; puissaunce, &amp; that without deferryng
or prolongyng of tyme, desiryng thē to prouide for money &amp; treasure
out of hand for the conduct &amp; wages of souldiors, to thentent that
nothing should lacke when thei shuld be ready to set on their enemies.
His causes wer so iust and his demaūdes so reasonable, that he had no
soner spoken but it was assented, and he had no soner demaūded but it
was graunted. And for to geue men a courage for to go furth, money
was fyrst gathered to make prouision for al thinges necessary for such
a royal voiage: for surely there was no creature whiche with that war
was either discōtented or displeased, for it semed to al men no lesse profitable
then honorable, nor no lesse honorable then conuenient.
               
                  IN this Parliament also Ihon duke of Bedford was made gouernor
or regent of the realme and head of the pulique welth, which office
he shuld enioy as long as the kyng was makyng warre on the French
nacion. The kyng before he would take his voyage, sent the earle of
Huntyngdon to serche and skoure the seas, least any Frenchmen liyng
in waite for him, might attrappe him sodenly or he had any knowledge
of their settyng forward. This lusty earle called Ihon Holand, sōne to
the duke of Excetter behedded at Circiter in the tyme of kyng Henry
the fourth and cosyn to the kyng with a great nombre of shippes searched
the sea from the one coast to the other. And inconclusion he encoū
                  tred
with .ix great carickes of Ieane (whiche lord Iaques the bastard
of Burbon had reteined to serue the Frenche kyng) &amp; set on thē sharply,
the conflict was great &amp; the fight long, but inconclusion the Frenchmen
wer ouercome and fled, and .iii. of the greatest carickes with their
patrones, and Monsure Iaques de Burbon their Admyral wer taken
with asmuche money as should haue payed the souldiors of the whole
flete for halfe a yere, and .iii. other carickes wer bouged and sent to the
botome of the sea.
               
                  THE kyng hearyng of this good chaunce, aboute the ende of Iuly
toke his ship at Portesmouth, accōpanied with the dukes of Clarence
and Gloucester brethren to the sayd kyng, the earles of Huntyngdon,
Mershal, Warwike, Deuonshyre, Salsbury, Suffolke and Sōmerset:
The lordes Rosse, Wylloughby, Fitzhugh, Clynton, Scrope, Matriuers,
Bourchier, Ferreys of Groby and Ferreys of Chartley, Fanhope,
Gray of Codnore, sir Gilbert Umfreuile, sir Gilbert Talbot &amp; diuers

other: and so hauyng wynde and wether to his desire, he lāded in
Normādy nere a castle called Touque, wher he cōsulted with his capitaines
what way was best to be taken cōcerning their high enterprise.
               
                  THE Normans hearyng of the kynges arriual wer sodenly striken
with a deadly feare and wer almost distracted frō their sences for dred▪
wherfore like mad men in desperacion they ranne out of their houses,
tounes and villages with wiues and children, bag and baggage into
the walled tounes and fortefied garrisons, cariyng with them corne,
wyne and vitaile necessary for their sustinance and liuyng, preparyng
swordes, hatchettes, crosbowes and al other weapons mere to set back
and resist their enemies, sent worde to Charles the Frenche kyng, requiryng
him to defend and preserue his louing subiectes against their
cruel and fierse enemies. The men of warre whiche were left in euery
place to skoure the countrey, went into walled tounes with the rural
cōminaltee, to thentent to aide and assist the tounes men, for well they
knewe that they were not able to resist their enemies beyng abroade in
the felde. So were al the walled tounes and castles in Normandy and
Mayne wel furnished with men and vitaile. The names of the Frēche
capitaines were to tedious to reherse, and therfore I ouerpasse them.
               
                  VVHEN kyng Henry had taken counsel, he layde siege to the castle
of Touque beyng very wel fortefied both with nature and mans arte
and began to assault it: &amp; although that they within valiantly defēded
it, yet by fine force he ouercame it, &amp; toke it, and them within to mercy, &amp;
made therof capitaines sir Robert Kerkeley knight, and after determined
to besiege the strong toune of Caen, remembryng according to the
dutie of a good capitaine, that the Frenchemen would come to healpe
their frendes beyng in nede and exstreme necessitie: whiche thyng he
most desired &amp; wished. And vpō that purpose he set furth toward Caen
after the warlikest fashion, depopulatyng the coūtrey, &amp; destroiyng the
villages on euery part as he passed. The toune of Caen standeth in a
plaine fertile coūtrey, no stronger walled then depe ditched, wel vitayled
and replenished with people. For the citezens fearyng the kynges
cōmyng had prouided for al thinges necessary &amp; defensible. And assone
as the kyng was come, he cast a depe trenche with a high mount to prohibite
them within the toune to haue any egresse or outwarde passage:
and that done, began fiersely to assault the toune. But the men of the
toune wer nothyng abashed and stode manly to their defence, abidyng
all chaunces whiche might ensue. The fight was fierce and euery mā
toke hede to his charge. The Englishmen studied all the waies possible
to damage their enemies, some shot arrowes, some cast stones and
other shot gonnes: some brake the walles with engynes and other vndermyned:
some set skalyng ladders to the wal, and other cast in wylde
fyre, euery man laboured to come to handstrokes, whiche was their desyre.
On the other side, the Normans threw doune great stones, barres
of yron, dartes, hote pitche and burnyng brimstone and boylyng lead.

diuers daies this assault cōtinued, not to the lytle losse of the Englishmen,
whiche toke more harme of the defēders then they gat hurt of the
assailantes. When kyng Henry perceiued that the dice rāne not to his
purpose, he abstained from the assault, &amp; determined by vnderminyng
to subuert and ouerthrowe the walles and towers of the toune. Wherfore
withal diligence the pyoners cast trenches &amp; the laborers brought
tymber, so that within a fewe daies the walles stode onely vpō postes,
to fal when fyre should be put to it. The kyng caused his people to approche
the walles and to kepe the citezens occupied, least either they
shuld make a coūtremyne or be an immpediment to his workemen and
laborers. Wherfore he caused thassault to be cried againe: then euerye
man ranne to the walles, some with skalyng ladders, some with hokes
and some with cordes and plommetes, euery man desiryng to get vpō
the walles and with hand to hand to graple with his enemy: The citezens
manfully defēded. While the fight was quicke and fierse on both
partes, the Englishmen in diuers places perced and brake through the
walles, and diuers ouertures and holes were made vnder the foundacion
by the pyoners, by the whiche thenglishmen might easely entre in
to the toune. The kyng hauyng cōpassion on the tounes men, desiryng
rather to haue them saued then destroyed if they wold humbly submyt
thē selues to his grace, &amp; fearyng that if the toune by fine force should
be spoyled and taken, that he should be compelled to geue it as a pray
to his men of warre to be sacked and destroyed, sent them worde by an
Herault that yet was tyme of mercy and clemency if they would incontinently
rendre them selues &amp; the toune: But they obstinately hopyng
of succour, answered that they would stand at their defence. Then the
Englishmen again skaled the walles and enterprised to enter through
the trenches. The fight was sore by the space of an houre, the English
men coragiously enforced to enter, and the Normans manfully defended,
but inconclusion the Englishmen obteined.
               
                  VVHEN the kyng was possessed of the toune, he incontinently cō
                  maunded
al harneys and weapons to be brought into one place, whiche
with al diligence was done without any resistence. Then the miserable
people knelyng on their knees, holdyng vp their handes, cried
mercy, mercy, to whom the kyng gaue certaine comfortable wordes &amp;
bad them stand vp. And then as he was euer accustomed to do, he wēt
on foote to the chief churche in the toune and rendred to God his most
heartie thankes for his prosperous successe and fortunate chaūce. And
yet that same night he would not slepe, but cōmaunded al his armye to
watche in aray, either least his men of warre in the night tyme might
fal to spoyle &amp; sacke, or els the citezens fearyng the sequele that might
ensue would priuely steale and conueigh them selues away.
               
                  IN the mornyng he called al the 
                     •
                  agestrates and gouernours into
the Senate house, where some for their stony stubbernes and mad obstinacy
were adiudged to dye, other were sore fined and highly raunsomed.

Then he callyng together his souldiors and men of war, bothe
gaue to thē high laudes and praises for their manly doynges, and also
distributed to euery man accordyng to his desert the spoyle &amp; gaine taken
of the toune &amp; the tounesmen, chiefly because at that assault he had
tried to his honor their valiant corages and vnfearfull hertes.
               
                  IT is to be imagined that kyng Henry in this conflict would principally
shewe aswell his owne force as the puissance and experience in
warres of his nacion, ether to the intent that the Frenchemen should
know that thei mette with suche an enemy as both was able to inuade
their countrie and defend their strength &amp; malice, or els not obliuious
that in makyng of warre euery prince muste study to obtain fame and
renoune: and as the old prouerbe saieth, of a thyng well begone, succedeth
a prosperous ende and a happy conclusion.
               
                  ALTHOVGH the toune were wonne, yet the castle whiche was
strong and well fortified bothe with men and all thynges necessary for
the defence, was yet in the Frenchmens possession: The capitain where
of, to thentent to shewe hymself valiant and not willyng to breake his
othe, nether to wauer from his allegeance, bosted that he would rather
dye in the defence then frely yeld the castle. Kyng Henry was not minded
to subuert the Castle (without whiche waie it was not easy to bee
wonne) because it was beautifull and necessary, both to kepe the toune
frō goyng backe, and also to defend thesame when oportunitee should
serue: Whiche Castle if he distroyed, he of very necessitee must again
build and reedifie, or els another in the place. Wherfore he sent worde
to the lorde Mountayny beyng capitain, that if he would yelde the castle
by a daie, he should depart without dammage, And if he would bee
foolishe and obstinate, all clemency and fauor should be from hym sequestred.
When the capitain and his compaignions had well digested
his message, beyng in dispaire of cōfort, vpon the condicion offred, rendred
the Castle and yelded themselfes. And so kyng Henry obteigned
bothe the toune and castle of Caen.
               
                  VVHILE the Kyng of Englande was besiegyng this toune, the
Frenchmen had nether a conuenient hoste to resist their power, nor wer
ready or able to releue their frendes in this miserable necessite, because
thei had such deuision and dissencion emongest themselfes, and a good
cause why: for kyng Charles was of so small wit by reason of his sicknes,
that he could not rule, and so he was spoyled bothe of his treasure
and of his kyngdome, and euery man spente and wasted the common
treasure. Charles the Dolphin beyng of the age of .xvi. or .xvii. yeres
onely lamented and bewailed the ruyne and decaye of his countrie: He
onely studied thaduauncement of the comon wealth, and he onely deuised
how to resist his enemies: but hauyng nether menne nor money, he
was greatly troubled and vnquieted. And in conclusion, by the counsaill
of therle of Armynacke Constable of Fraunce, he founde a meane
to get all the treasure and riches whiche quene Isabell his mother had

gotten and horded in diuerse secrete places: and for the comon vtilite of
his countrie he spente it wisely in wagyng of souldiors and preparyng
of thinges necessary for the war. The quene forgettyng the great perel
that the realme then stode in, but remēbryng y• displesure to her by this
act dooen, declared her sonne and the Constable to be her mortall enemies,
&amp; promised that thei should be persecuted to the vttermoste. And
euen for very womanly malice, she set in the highest authoritie aboute
the kyng her husband, Ihon duke of Burgoyn geuyng hym the regiment
and direccion of the kyng and his realme with all preheminence
and souera
                     •
                  ntie. The duke of Burgoyn hauyng now the sworde of authoritie,
for the whiche he so sore longed and glad to be reuenged of his
old iniuries, began to make warre on the Dolphyn: and when he had
once tamed and framed to his purpose this young vnbrideled gentleman,
then he determined as he might to refell and withstande the comē
enemies of the realme. Thesame or like reason moued the Dolphin, for
he myndyng first to represse and extincte the ciuill dissencion at home,
before he would inuade forain enemies, prepared warre to subdew and
destroy duke Ihō of Burgoyn as the chief hed &amp; leader of that wicked
and great mischief: Wherby the realme was muche vnquieted &amp; more
decayed, and in maner brought to a final ruyne and vtter destruccion.
So Fraunce was inflamed and in euery part troubled with warr and
deuision, and yet no man would ether prouide in so great a danger, nor
once put furth their finger to hynder the mischief.
               
                  KYNG Henry not myndyng to lye still in Normandy, nor to leaue
his enterprice vnperformed, sent the duke of Clarence to the sea coast,
whiche with greate difficulty gatte the toune of Bayeux. The duke of
Glocestre also with smal assault and lesse defence toke the citee of Liseaux.
In the meane ceason Kyng Henry taried still at Cane fortefiyng
the toune and the castle, and put out of the toune .xv.C. women and impotent
persons, and replenished the toune with English people. While
the kyng soiourned at Caen, he kepte there a solempne feast and made

pitee &amp; more deuocion. For in searchyng the castle he found there innumerable

When the fame of gettyng of Caen was blowen through Normandy,
the Normans wer so sore afraied &amp; so muche abasshed that you should
not onely haue seen men, women &amp; children ronnyng in euery waie by
great plōpes frō toune to toune, not knowyng whether to flie: but also
the rurall persones and huseband men draue the beastes out of the villages
into suche places where thei hoped of refuge or defence: so that a
man would haue thought that Normandy had sodainly been left desolate
and voyde of people and catell. But when the rumor was spred abroade
of his clemency shewed to captiues and of his mercy graunted

to suche as submitted themselfes to his grace, all the capitaines of the
tounes adioynyng came willyngly to his presēce, offryng to hym them
selfes, their tounes and their goodes. Wherupon he made proclamacion
that al men whiche had or would become his subiectes and swere
to hym allegeance should enioy their goodes and liberties in as large
or more ample maner then thei did before. Whiche gentle entreteinyng
and fauorable hādlyng of the stubburne Normans, was the very cause
why thei wer not only content, but also glad to remoue and turne from
the Frenche part and become subiectes to the croune of Englande.

nauy lost nothyng on the sea, but so skowred the stremes that nether
Frencheman nor Briton durst once apere, howbeit one daie there arose
so hideous a tempest and so terrible a storme, that nether cable held nor
anker preuailed, so that if the erles of Marche and Huntyngdon had
not taken the hauē of Southamptō, the whole nauie had perished and
the people had been destroyed, and yet the sauegard was straunge: For
in thesame hauen two Balyngers and two great Carickes laden with
marchaundise wer drouned, and the broken Maste of another Caricke
was blowen ouer the wall of Hāpton (as diuerse writers affirme) suche
is the power of the wynd, and suche is the rigoure of the tempest. Whē
the fury of the wynd was asswaged and the sea waxed calme, therles of
Marche and Huntyngdon passed ouer the sea with all their compainy
and landed in Normandy marchyng towarde the kyng, before whom
the Normans fled as fast as the fearfull hare dooth before the gredy
Greyhounde, or the sely Partridge before the Sparowhauke. And so
thei passed through the countrie destroiyng of villages and takyng
paynes till thei came to the kyng goyng towarde Roan. Duryng this
marciall feactes and greate conquestes in Normandy, sir Ihon Oldecastle

                  n nor any
thyng gotten excepte he brought the famous citee of
Roan beyng the Empery and diademe of the Duchy of Normandy in
to his possession &amp; dominion, to the whiche out of euery parte the Normans
had conueighed their money Iewelles and houshold stuffe: And

whiche citee sithe his firste arriual thei had not onely walled and 
                     •
                  ortressed

                     •
                  āt
capitaines and hardy souldiours to no small numbre. Wherfore he set
forward his army toward the toune called Pontlarche standyng vpon
the Riuer of Seyne .viij. mile from Roan betwene Paris and Roan.
When the Frenchemen whiche kepte the passage heard of the kynges
approchyng, thei gathered together a greate numbre of men of warre
redy to defend and prohibite the passage, apointyng another a band of
men if thei failed to kepe the farther side of the bridge and to watche
and hourely attend that he nether by bote nor by vessell should eskape
any maner of waye. When he came to the toune, first he sette forwarde
towarde the bridge, whiche when he sawe it so well defended that it
would not without greate losse be obteigned, sodainly he blew the retraite
and reculed almoste a myle backward, where in a pleasant place
by the riuers side he pitched his Campe: and in the night season, what
with botes and barges, what with hoggeshedes and pipes he conueighed
ouer the brode riuer of Seyne a greate compaignie of his armie
without any resistaunce of his enemies. For thei whiche wer on the hetherside
of Seyne, thynkyng that thenglishmen had gone to conquere
some other place folowed thē not, but studied how to defēd their toune
(whiche was ynough for them to do). When the king saw that his men
wer on the otherside of the water, he the next day earely returned to the
toune and assauted it on bothe the sides. When thinhabitantes perceiued
that contrary to their expectaciō thei wer cōpassed &amp; beset by their enemies
and sawe no hope of refuge or succor, with humble hert and no
great ioy rendered vp the toune▪ And so the kyng hauyng no let or impediment
determined to besege and assault the citee and castle of Roan
for the whiche he had taken diuerse long and tedious iornayes, and sēt
before hym his vncle the lorde Thomas duke of Excester with agreat
compaignie of horssemen and Archers, whiche with banner displayed
came before the toune and sent to the capitaines Wyndsore a heraulte
at armes, willyng them to deliuer the toune to the kyng his Master, or
els he would persecute them with fire, bloud and sworde. To whō thei
proudly answered, that none thei receiued of hym, nor none thei would
deliuer, except by fyne force thei wer therunto cōpelled. And to declare
thēselfes valiant capitaines &amp; hardy men of war, there issued out of the
toune a great band of men of armes &amp; encoūtred fiercely with thēglishmen,
whiche like men nether afraied nor astonied manfully them receiued
&amp; with fyne force draue them into the toune again, leuyng with the
Englishmen .xxx. of their compaignie prisoners and ded persons. The
duke with this good spede and proude aunswer of the Frenche capitaines,
returned to the kyng to whom was rendred alitle before y• toune of
Louiers, whiche he gaue to his said brother the duke of Clarence, whiche
made there his deputie sir Ihon Godard knight. The duke of Excester

at the hous of Charitee on the East side of the citee, &amp; the duke of Clarence
lodged b

                  fore the port of Caux on the West part of the citee. The
duke of Excester toke his place on the Northside at the porte Denise:
betwene the dukes of Excester and Clarence was appoyncted the erle
Marshall euen before the gate of the castle, to whom wer ioyned therle
of Ormond and the Lordes of Haryngton and Talbot. And from the
duke of Excester toward the kyng were encamped the lordes of Rosse,
Willoughby, Fitzhugh and sir William Porter with a great band of
Northrenmē euen before the port saint Hillarij. Therles of Mortaint
and Salsbery wer assigned about the Abbey of saint Kathermes. Sir
Ihon Grey was lodged directly against the Chapel called Mount. S
Mighell, sir Philip Leche treasorer of the warres kept the hil next the
Abbey, &amp; the Baron of Carew kept the passage on the riuer of Sayne,
and to hym was ioyned a valiaunt esquire called Ienico, whiche twoo
capitaines valiauntly kept the riuage of the water of Sayne. On the
fartherside of the riuer wer lodged therles of Warren and Huntyngdon,
the lordes Neuell and Ferrers, sir Gilbert Umfreuile with a well
furnished company of warlik souldiors directly before the gate called
port du Pont. And to the intent that no aide should passe by the riuer
toward the citee, a greate chaine of yron was deuised at Pōtlarche and
sette on piles from the one side of the water to the other, and beside that
chayne he sette vp a new forced bridge, sufficient bothe for cariage and
passage. At whiche therle of Warwicke whiche had gotten Damp
                     •
                  rōt
was sent to the toune of Cawdebeck standyng on the riuerside betwen
the sea and the citee of Roan, whiche toune he so hardly assaulted, that
the capitaines offered to suffre the Englishe nauy to passe by their
toune without hurte or detriment to the citee of Roan: And also if Roan
yelded, thei promised to rendre their toune without any fayle or farther
delaie. And this composicion thei sealed, and for performaunce
of thesame thei deliuered pledges. This appoynctment the Englishe
nauy to the numbre of .C. sailes passed by Cawdebeck and came before
Roan and besieged it on the water side. To this siege came the duke of
Gloucester with therle of Suffolke and the lorde of Burgainy whiche
had taken the toune of Chierburgh and wer lodged before the porte of
Sainct Hillarij nerer their enemies by fortie roddes then any other
persones of the armie.
               
                  
                  DVRYNG this siege arriued at Harflew the lorde of Kylmaine in
Ireland with a band of .xvi. hundreth Ireshmen armed in mayle with
dartes and skaynes after the maner of their countrey, all talle, quicke
and deliuer persons, whiche came and presented them selues before the
kyng liyng styl at the siege: of whom they were not onely gentely entertained,
but also (because that the kyng was informed that the Frenche
kyng and the duke of Burgoyn would shortly come, and either rayse
the siege or vitaile or mā the toune at the North gate) thei wer appointed
to kepe the Northsyde of the army, and in especial the way that cō
                  meth
from the forest of Lyons. Whiche charge the lord of Kylmaine &amp;
his company ioyfully accepted &amp; did so their deuoyre, that no men wer
more praised nor did more damage to their enemies then they did for
surely their quicknes &amp; swiftnes did more preiudice to their enemies,
thē their great barded horses did hurt or damage the nimble Irishmē.
               
                  THVS was the fayre cytie of Roan compassed about with enemies
besieged by princes, and belet about both by water and lande, hauyng
neither comfort nor ai
                     •
                  e of kyng nor dolphyn. And although the army
were strong without, yet within there lacked neither hardy capitaynes
nor manful souldiors. And as for people, they had more then ynowe,
for as it was written by him that knew the nombre and had no occasiō
to erre from the trueth, there were at the time of the siege within the citie,
of christen people CC. and ten thousand persons. Dayly wer issues
made out of the cytie at diuers portes, sometyme thenglishmen gat, at
another time the Frenchmen saued, somtyme neither of both either got
or saued: for surely the capitaines and men of warre within the toune
settyng more by honor then by life, preferryng fame before worldly riches,
dispisyng pleasure &amp; vilependyng fearfull heartes, sware eche
to other neuer to render or deliuer the toune while they might either
hold sworde in hand or put spere in rest. The kyng of England beyng
aduertised of their haute courages and high stomackes, determined to
conquere them by famyne whiche would not be tamed by weapon.
               Wherfore he stopped all the passages both by water and land that no
vitaile could be cōueighed to the cytie, he cast treaches rounde about
the walles and set them ful of stakes and defended thē with archers, so
that thei within could haue no way out ether to inuade their enemies
(or if they could) to depart and relinquishe their fortresse and cytie.
               One day tidynges wer fayned that the Frenche kyng approched with
al his power to raise the siege &amp; reskew the cytie: Wherfore kyng Hēry
cōmaunded al men to lye in their harneys lest they might by some subtile
cautel be surprised vnware and taken vnprouided. But the Frēche
kyng neither came nor sent, to the great wonder of thenglishmen.
               This siege thus continuyng from Lammas almost to Christmas, diuers
enterprises were attempted and diuers polices were deuised how
euery part might damage and hurte his aduersary and enemy, but no
part muche reioysed of their gaine. Duryng whiche tyme, vitayle began

sore to faile within the toune, so that only vineger &amp; water serued
for drinke. If I should reherse accordyng to the writyng of diuers authors,
not onely howe deare dogges, rattes, myse and cattes wer solde
within the toune: but how gredely they were by the poore people eaten
and deuoured, and also howe the people died dayly for faute of foode,
and how yong infātes lay suckyng in the stretes on their mothers brestes
liyng dead, staruen for hunger, you would more abhorre the lothsome
doynges then reioyse at their miserable mischāce. The riche men
within the toune put out at the gates the pore and indigent creatures
whiche were by thenglishmen that kept the trenches beaten &amp; driuen
backe againe to the gates of the toune, whiche against them were closed
and barred. So this miserable people vncomfortably forsaken &amp;
vnnaturally dispised of their owne nacion and housholde felowes, betwene
the walles of their cytie and the trēches of their enemies lay styl
criyng for helpe and relief, for lacke wherof innumerable sely solles
dayly died and hourely starued. Yet kyng Henry moued with pitie &amp;
stirred with cōpassion in the honor of Christes natiuitie on Christmas
day refreshed al the poore people with vitayle to their great comfort &amp;
relief: for the whiche act they not only thanked, lauded and praised the
kyng of England, but also praied to God for his preseruacion and furtherance,
and for the hynderance and euil successe of their vnkynd citezens
&amp; vncharitable country men. This miserable famyne dayly more
and more encreasyng so daunted the heartes of the bold capitaynes, &amp;
so abated the courages of the riche burgesses, and so turmēted the bodies
of the poore citezens, that the stout souldiour for faintnes could
ska
                     •
                  e welde his weapon, nor the riche marchaunt for money could not
bye a sheuer of bread: so that the cōminaltie cried to the captaines, and
the nedy people besought the lordes to haue compassion on them, and
to inuent some way for their succor and comfort. The gouernou
                     •
                  s of
the toune, after long consultacion had, consideryng the great necessitie
that they were in, and seyng none apparence of succour or relief, determined
it both necessary and conuenient to treate with the kyng of England.
And so vpō Newyeres euen ther came to the walles at the gate
of the bridge diuers cōmissioners appoincted by the capitaines, whiche
made a signe to thenglishemen liyng without to speake with some
gentleman or other person of authoritie. The earle of Huntyngdon
whiche kept that part sent to them sir Gilbert Umfreuile, to whō they
declared that if they might haue a guyde or a safeconduite they would
gladly speake with the kyng. Syr Gilbert promised not onely to do
theyr message, but also to certifie thē of the kinges pleasure &amp; purpose.
Whiche cōmunicacion ended, he repaired to the duke of Clarence and
other of the kynges counsail, aduertisyng thē of the request of the citezens,
whiche incōtinent assembled thē selues in the kynges lodgyng,
where sir Gilbert Umfreuile wysely and soberly declared to the kyng
the myndes and intentes of the citezens. The kyng like a graue prince

consideryng that a thyng gotten without effusion of Christen bloud is
both honorable and profitable, and sawe that the haute corages of the
braggyng Frenchmen wer now by his hard besiegyngsore abated and
almost tamed, thought it conuenient to heare their lowly peticion and
humble request, and so willed sir Gilbert to aduertise them that he was
content to heare .xii. of them whiche should be safely cōueighed to his
presence: With this answere sir Gilbert departed and made relacion
therof to the capitaynes standyng at the gate. Whiche on the next day
in the mornyng appointed .iiii. knightes .iiii. lernedmen and .iiii. sage
burgesses al clothed in blacke to go to the kyng of Englād. These .xii.
persons wer receiued at the port sainct Hillarij by sir Gilbert Umfreuile
accompanied with diuers gentlemen and yomen of the kynges
houshold, comonly called yomen of the croune, and conueighed to the
kynges lodgyng, whō they found at Masse. When the deuine seruice
was finished king Henry gorgeously apparelled and sumpteously adourned
came out of his trauers, fiersely and princely beholdyng the
Frenche messēgers and passe

as vndiscrete sayd these wordes. Right high and mightie prince,

                     , the Goddesse of battaile. The goddesse of warre called Bellona
(which is the correctrice of princes for right witholdyng or iniurie doyng,
and the plage of God for euil liuyng and vntrue demeanor amongest
subiectes) hath these .iii. handmaides euer of necessitie attendyng
on her, bloud, fyre, and famine, whiche thre damosels be of that force &amp;
strength that euery one of them alone is able and sufficient to turment
and afflict a proud prince: and they al ioyned together are of puissance
to destroy the most populous countrey and most richest region of the
world. If I by assaultyng of your toune should seke your bloud (although
I gained as I doubt not but I should) yet my gaine wer not
cleare without some losse of my people. If I set your cytie on fyre, and
so consume it and you also, then haue I lost that precious iewel for the
whiche I haue so sore longed and so long laboured. Therfore to saue
myne owne people (whiche is one poinct of glory in a capitaine) and to
preserue the toune whiche is my lauful and iust inheritaunce: And to
saue as many of you as wil not willyngly be destroied, I haue appointed
the makest maide of the thre damosels to aff
                     •
                  lict and plage you tyll
you be bridled and brought to reason, which shalbe when it shal please
me and not at your appointment: And therfore I say and affirme that
the gayne of a capitaine by any of these thre handmaides is bothe glorious,
honorable and triumphant, but of all thre the yongest maide is
in al thinges most profitable and cōmodious. Now to answer to your
demaundes, as touching the pore people liyng in the ditches, I assure
you I more lament your lacke of charitie toward your christen brethrē
ye and your owne nacion of one language and one countrey, then I reioyce
at the vndoyng of so many creatures and castyng away of so many
enemies. You like tirantes put thē out of the toune to thentent that
I should slay them, and yet I haue saued their liues. You would neither
geue them meat nor drinke, and yet I beyng their mortal enemy
haue succoured and releued them: so that if any vncharitie be, it is in
you, if any shame or reproche be taken, receiue it your selfe, for you be
the doers. If I haue done them good let God rewarde me, for I loke
of them no thankes, if you haue done them euil so shal you be done to.
And as to suffre your pore people to passe out of the cytie through my
campe, no no, I wyll not so accomplishe your cloked request, but you
shal kepe them styl to helpe to spend your vitailes: And as to assault
your toune, I wil you know it that I am therto both able and willyng
as I se tyme &amp; occasion: but seyng the choice is in my hand to tame you
either with bloud, fyre, or famyne, or with all, I wyl take the choice at

my pleasure &amp; not at yours. And with that the kyng with a frownyng
countenaunce departed frō them to his chambre and cōmaunded them
to dine with his officers.
               
                  VVHEN he was departed, the Frenchmen began to marueil at his
excellent wit, and to muse at the hautnes of his courage, and after they
had dined and consulted together, they required once againe to haue
accesse to his royal presence, whiche when it was to them graūted, they
humblyng them selues on their knees besought him to take a truce
for .viii. daies, in the whiche they might by their commissioners take
some ende and good conclusion with him and his counsail. The kyng
like a piteous prince rather couetyng the preseruacion of the people,
then their distruction, after good deliberacion taken, graūted to them
their askyng, with the whiche answere they ioyously returned.
               
                  AFTER their departure wer appointed and set vp .iii. riche tentes,
the one for the lordes of England to consult together, the second for the
commissioners of the cytie, and third for both partes to argue and debate
the matter. The cōmissioners for the Englishe part wer the erles
of Warwike &amp; Salsbury, the lord Fitzhugh, sir water Hungerford, sir
Gilbert Umfreuile, sir Ihon Robsert &amp; Ihon be Uasques de Almada.
And for the French part wer apointed sir Guy de Butteler &amp; .vi. other.
               
                  DVRYNG this truce, euery day the cōmissioners met, the Englishmen
accused and the Frenchmen excused, the Englishmen demaunded
muche, and the Frenchmen profered lytle. Thus with arguyng &amp; reasonyng
the .viii. day came and nothyng was done, nor one article concluded.
Wherfore the Englishmen toke doune the tentes &amp; the French
men toke their leaue, but at their departyng, they remembryng them
selues required the Englishe lordes for the loue of God that the truce
might continue tyl the sunne risyng the next day, to the whiche the lordes
sone assented. When the Frenchmen wer returned to Roan, sodenly
in al the toune sprong a rumour that the truce was expired and nothyng
determined. Then the poore people ranne about the stretes like
frantike persons, shoutyng and criyng and callyng the captaines and
gouernors murtherers and manquellers, saiyng that for their pride &amp;
styffe stomacke al this misery was happened in the toune, threatenyng
to slay them if they would not agre to the kyng of Englādes demaund
and request. The Magistrates beyng amased with the fury of the people,
called al the toune together to knowe their myndes and opinions.
The whole voice of the cōmons was to yelde, yeld, rather then starue.
Then the Frenchmen in the euenyng came to the tent of sir Ihon Robsert,
requiryng him of gētlenes to moue the kyng that the truce might
be prolonged for .iiii. daies. The kyng therunto agreed and appointed
tharchbishop of Cantorbury and the other .vii. before named for
his part, and the citezens appoincted an egal nomber for them. So the
tentes were againe set vp, dayly was assembles and muche treaty on
both parties, and on the fourth day by the helpe of God, the treaty was

concluded and finished to the great reioysyng of the poore citezens, the
copy wherof foloweth worde by worde.

hym diuerse faire &amp; costly presentes. In this maner he passed through
the citee to our Lady Churche, where with al solempnitie he was receiued
by the bishop and Cannons, and after he had said his Orisons, he
caused his chapelaynes to syng his Antheme Quis est magnus dominus.
Who is so greate a Lorde as is our God. &amp;c. And that doen he came to
the Castle where he continued a good space after, receiuyng homages
and fealties of the burgesses and tounes men, settyng ordres emōgest
them and reedefied diuerse fortresses and toures. Duryng which tyme
he made proclamacion that al men whiche would become his subiectes
should enioye their goodes, landes and offices, whiche proclamacion
caused many tounes to yeld, and many men become Englishe. At whiche
ceason the duke of Britain seyng that the power of Fraunce began
to decaye, came to the kyng to Roan and concluded with hym a league
of his owne mere mocion: Fearyng that ether he should afterward bee
compelled therunto, or els if he offred to late it would not be accepted.
                  
                     VVHEN the renderyng of Roan was blowen through Normandy
and the kynges proclamacion diuulged through the countrie, it is in
maner incredible to heare how many tounes yelded not once desired,
and how many fortresses gaue vp without contradicion, wherof I wil

capitaines of the same.

               ¶The seuenth yere.The .vii. yere
               
               
                  WHEN the gettyng of Roan and the deliuery of the other
tounes wer blased and blowen through the whole realme
of Fraunce, wonder it is to tell and more to beleue howe
the hertes of the Frenchmen wer sodainly heuy and their
courages sone coled, mournyng and lamentyng the iminent
mischief whiche thei sawe by the diuision of the nobilitee like shortely
to fal on their heddes: and the more sorowyng their euil chance because
thei sawe no remedy prepared, nor yet none help at hand thought
on. But whosoeuer kicked or wynched at this matter, Ihon duke of
Burgoyn raged and swelled, ye and so muche freated that he wist not
what to saie and lesse to dooe: And no meruaill, for he was vexed and
troubled with a doble desease at one only tyme. For he only ruled both
kyng Charles and his, and did all thynges at his will whether reason
agreed or no, and for that cause he knewe that he was nether free from
dis
                     •
                  ain nor yet deliuered from the scope of malice. And therfore he imagined
that all mischiefes and calamities whiche chaunced in the common
wealth should bee imputed and assigned to his vnpolitike doyng
or to his negligent permission: wherfore he ymagined it proffitable to
the realme and to hymself moste auaylable, if he by any meanes possible
could deuise, practise or inuent any waie or meane by the whiche he
might reconcile and ioyne in amitee the twoo greate and mightie kynges
of Englande and of Fraunce. Whiche thyng once obteigned and
beyng deliuered from al feare of exterior hostilitee, he determined first
to reuenge his quarell against Charles the Dolphyn, and after to represse

all causes of grudge or disdain, and to recouer again bothe the
fauor of the commonaltee and also to put awaie al causes of suspicion
or imagined infamy against hym and his procedynges. And intēdyng
to buyld vpon this fraile foundacion, sent letters and Ambassadors to
the kyng of Englande, aduertisyng hym that if he would personally
come to a communicacion to bee had betwene hym and Charles the
Frenche kyng, he doubted not but by his onely meanes, peace should
be induced and blouddy battaill clerely exiled.
               
                  KYNG Henry heard gentely the Ambassadors and agreed to their
request and desire, and so came to Maunte, where at the feast of Pentecost
he kept a liberall hous to all commers, and sat hymself in greate
estate. On whiche daie ether for good seruice before by them dooen, or
for good expectacion of thynges to come, he created Gascon de Foys a
valiaunt Gascoyn erle of Longeuile, and sir Ihon Grey was likewise
made erle of Tankeruile, and the Lorde Burshier Erle of Ewe. After
this solempne feast ended, the place of the enteruiewe and metyng was
apoynted to be beside Melaus on the riuer of Seyne, in a faire playne
euery parte was by commissioners appoynted to their grounde▪ The
Frenchmen diched, trenched, and paled their lodgynges for feare of afterclappes:
But the Englishmen had their parte only barred and ported.
The kyng of Englande had a large tent of blewe veluet and grene
richely embrodered with two deuises, the one was an Antlop drawyng
in an horse mill, the other was an Antlop sittyng in an high stage with
a braunche of Olife in his mouthe: And the tente was replenished and
decked with this poysie. After busie laboure commeth victorious reste, and
on the top and heigth of thesame was set a greate Egle of golde, whose
iyes wer of suche orient Diamondes that thei glistered and shone ouer
the whole felde.
               
                  THE Frenche Kyng likewise had in his parke a faire pauilion of
blew veluet richely embrodered with flower deluse, on the toppe of the
thesame was set a white Harte fliyng, made all of fyne siluer with winges
enameled. Betwene these two Campes or enclosers was apoynted
a tent of purple veluet for the coūsailers to mete in and euery part had
an egall nombre to watch on the night and to se good ordre on the day.
               
                  VVHEN the daie of apoinctment approched, the kyng of England
acco
                     •
                  paignied with the Dukes of Clarence and Gloucester his brethren,
and the duke of Excester his vncle, and Henry Beauford Clerke
his other vncle whiche after was bishop of Winchester and Cardinall
and the erles of Marche, Salsbury and other to the numbre of a thousand
men of warre, entered into his parke and toke his lodgyng. Likewise
for the Frenche part, thether came Isabell the Frenche Quene because
the kyng her husband was fallen into his old frenaticall desease
hauyng in her compaigny the duke of Burgoyn and therle of Sainct
Paule, and she had attendyng on her the faire lady Katheryn her doughter
and .xxvi. ladies and damoselles, and had also for her furniture

a thousande men of warre.
               
                  AFTER these estates had reposed themselfes one night in their tentes,
the next day al suche as were appointed repaired toward the pauilion
ordained for the consultacion. Where the kyng of England, like
a prince of great stomacke and no lesse good behauor receiued humbly
the Frenche quene and her daughter and them honorably embraced &amp;
familierly kyssed. The duke of Burgoyn made lowe curtesy and bowed
to the kyng, whom the kyng louyngly toke by the hand and honorably
entertained. After salutacions and embrasynges finished, they
fel to counsel within the pauilion assigned, whiche was kept with a
garde appointed by both the parties that none but cōmissioners shuld
once attempt to enter. After the kynges requestes made &amp; his demaundes
declared, the French quene and her company toke leaue louyngly
of the kyng of England and returned to Ponthoyse to certifie her husband
of her demaundes and claymes, And kyng Henry returned to
Mante. The next day after, they assembled againe, &amp; the Frenche part
brought with them the lady Katherin, only to thentent that the king of
England seyng and beholdyng so fayre a lady and so minion a damosel,
should so be inflamed and rapte in loue, that he to obtayne so
beautiful an espouse, should the soner agre to a gentle peace &amp; louyng
composicion. This company met together .viii. seueral tymes, sometyme
the one parte was more, and sometyme the other. And notwithstandyng
that the Englishmen and Frenchmen were lodged no great
distance a sunder, yet was there neuer fraye nor occasion of tumulte or
riot prouoked or stirred of any of both the parties, whiche (bothe their
natures considered) is somewhat to be marueiled at.
               
                  IN this assemble many wordes were spent and no dedes done, many
thinges required and few offered, many argumentes made and no cō
                  clusion
taken. Some authors write that the dolphyn on let this treatie
sent to the duke of Burgoyne sir Tauegny du Chastel, declaryng to
him that if he would let this agrement, he would cōmon with him and
take suche an ordre, that not only they but the whole realme of Fraūce
should therof be glad and reioyce: But what was the very cause of the
breche, no man certainly declareth. When no effect ensued of this long
consultacion, both parties after a princely fashion departed, the Englishmen
to Mantes and the Frenchmen to Ponthoyse.
               
                  THE kyng of England was nothing pleased nor yet contented that
this cōmunicacion came to none ende, Wherfore he mistrustyng the
duke of Burgoyn to be the very let and stop of his desires and requestes,
sayd vnto him before his departyng: fayre cosin, we wil haue your
kynges daughter and al thinges that we damaund with her, or we wil
driue your kyng &amp; you out of his realme. Well sayd the duke of Burgoyn,
before you driue the kyng and me out of his realme, you shalbe
wel weried, and therof we doubt lytle.
               
                  AFTER this departure, the duke of Burgoyn beyng nobly accompanied,

roade to the toune of Melune wher the dolphyn then soiorned
where in the plaine feldes they .ii. like frendes cōmoned together &amp; cō
                  cluded
apparantly an open amitie &amp; sure frendship, which was written
by notaries and signed with their handes and sealed with their great
s
                     •
                  ales of armes, but as the sequele sheweth, heart thought not that
tong talked, nor mynde meant that hand wrote. This treaty was concluded
the .vi. day of Iuly in the yere of our lord 1419 and was proclaymed
in Paris, Amience and Ponthoyse.
               
                  THIS newe alience notified shortely to the kyng of England liyng
at Maunt, whiche therwith was sore displeased, and not without cau
                     •
                  e
For he perceiued that the force of these two princes were muche stronger
now beyng vnited in one, then they were before beyng seperated &amp;
deuided. Yet notwithstandyng this great sworne and sealed amitie, he
nothyng more minded then to set forward his intented enterprise with
the ayde of God to performe his conquest maugre and euil wyll and
puissaunce of his enemies. Wherfore he sent the capitayne of Bueffe
brother to the earle of Foys newly created earle of Longuile with .xv.C.
men secretly to the toune of Ponthoyse, whiche on Trinitie sonday
erly in the mornyng came to the toune, and so sodainly and so shortely
set vp their skalyng ladders to the wal, that they were entred into the
toune or the watche perceiued them, criyng saint George, saint George
The lord Lisleadam capitain of the toune perceiuyng the walles skaled
and the market place gained, opened the gate toward Paris, at the
whiche he withal his retinue and diuers of the tounes men to the nombre
of .viii. thousand fled. For the Englishmen durst not because their
nombre was smal ones deuide them selues or fal to pilfryng, til about
prime the duke of Clarence came to their ayde with .v. thousand men,
and by the way he encoūtred diuers burgesses of the toune fliyng with
al their substance toward Beauuoys whō he toke prisoners &amp; brought
them againe to their olde dwellyng place. When the duke was come
to Ponthoyse, he muche praised the valiantnes of the assailantes and
gaue to them the chief spoyle of the toune and marchauntes, of the whiche
they had great plenty and foyson. Then the duke with a great puissaunce
came before Paris and lay before the cytie two daies and two
nightes without any proffre either of issue by his enemies or of defēce
if he had the same assauted, whiche he could not wel do because it was
long and ample, and his nōbre smal, and for so great an enterprise not
furnished: Wherfore seyng that his enemies durst not ones loke on
him, he returned againe to Ponthoyse, for the takyng of whiche toune,
the countrey of Fraunce, &amp; in especial the Parisienswer sore dismayed
and astonied, for there was no fortresse hable to resist or withstand. In
so muche the Irishmen ouercame al the Isle of Fraunce and did to the
Frenchmen dammages innumerable (as their writters affirme) and
brought dayly praies to the Englishe armye. And beside that, they
would robbe houses and lay beddes on the backes of the kine and ride

vpō them, and cary yong children before them and sel them to the Englishmen
for slaues: Whiche straung doynges so feared the Frenchemen
within the territory of Paris and the coūtrey about, that the rude
persons fled out of the villages withal their stuffe to the cytie of Paris
               
                  THE Frenche kyng and the duke of Burgoyn liyng at S. Denise
hearyng of al these doynges, departed in al the hast with the quene and
her daughter to Troys in Champaigne, there takyng great deliberacion
what was best to be done, leauyng at Paris the earle of S. Paul
and the lord Lisleadam with a great puissance to defende the cytie. At
the same tyme the duke of Clarence toke the strong toune of Gysors, &amp;
after that was taken the toune of Gayllard: and al the tounes of Normandy
shortely after were either taken by force or rendred, except the
Mount 
                     •
                  aint Michel, whiche because the gayne therof was very lytle
and the losse in assautyng semed to be very muche, and also it could do
smal harme or none to the countrey adioynyng, was neither assaulted
nor besieged.
               
                  AND thus as you haue heard, was the duchy of Normandy reduced
agayne into the right line and restored to the possession of the right
heyre, which had bene 
                     •
                  rō the tyme of kyng Henry the third, in the yere
of our lord 1255 wrongfully detained from the kynges of England.
               
                  THE wisemen of Fraunce sore lamentyng the chaunce of their coū
                  trey
and the misery of their people sawe and perceiued that they had
puissance ynough to defende their enemies if they were at a perfite cō
                  cord
amongest them selues. For they apparantly sawe that although
there wer a peace openly concluded betwene the dolphyn and the duke
of Burgoyn, yet thei imagined that no good fruit succeded of thesame
for the duke either for secret displeasure that he bare to the dolphyn, or
for the doubt that he had of thenglishmē, neuer assailed by him self the
army of kyng Henry, nor neuer sent ayde or succours to the Dolphyn.
Wherfore by meanes of frendes a new cōmunicacion was appointed
to thentent that the corrupt dregges of their olde malice and inwarde
grudges might be clearely cast out and extinct. The place of this metyng
was appoincted at the toune of Monstrel fault Yonne, so called
because a smal brooke called Yonne runneth there to the riuer of Sein
ouer whiche riuer was made a bridge, with diuers barres ouerthwart
so that the princes openyng the barres might eche embrace and touche
other, and kepyng the barres shut, eche might se &amp; common with other
at their pleasure. The day was appointed when these .ii. great princes
should mete on this bridge, to thentent that al ciuile discord should by
this cōmunicacion be cleare forgotten, or at the least should be suspended
tyl the enemies were vanquished and driuen out of their coūtries
and confines. But this mocion worse succeded then the entreators deuised,
for while euery man was fulfilled with hope of peace and concord,
crafty imaginacion crepte out of cancard displeasure had almost
brought al thinges from libertie into bondage.
               
                  
                  VVHEN the day &amp; place of the solempne enteruiewe was agreed &amp;
assigned, Tauagny du Chastel, a mā prompt and prone to al mischief,
called to his remembraunce the shamefull murder of Lewes duke of
Orleaunce (vnder whom he had long bene a capitaine) done and committed
by this duke of Burgoyne as before you haue heard, determined
with him selfe to reuenge the death of his olde Maister and lorde.
Some say that he was therto stirred &amp; prouoked by the dolphyn (and
not vnlike) for the dolphyn whiche bare a continual hatred to the duke
of Burgoyn, imagined paraduenture by this meanes to represse and
subdue the whole power and high pride of this duke, without any suspection
of fraude or reproche of vntruth or vilany. Wel the day came,
whiche was the .xii. day of August, and euery prince with his nombre
appointed came to this bridge. The duke of Burgoyne beyng warned
by his frendes to kepe his closure and the barres on his side shut, lytle
regarded his frēdesmonicion as a mā that could not auoide the stroke
for him prouided, and so opened the barres and closure and came to the
dolphyns presence, whiche was cleane armed, and kneled doune on the
one kne, shewyng to him great reuerence and humilitie. The dolphyn
shewed him no louyng countenaunce, but reproued him, laiyng to his
charge muche vntruth and great dishonor. The duke againe boldly
defended his cause. Nowe the duke duryng this cōmunicacion kneled
styl and his sworde was at his backe with often turnyng and mouyng
in answeryng the dolphyn and his counsel, and so he put his hād backe
to plucke his sworde forwarde: what ꝙ sir Robert de Loyer, wyll you
drawe your sworde against my lorde the dolphyn? when Tauagny du
Chastel apperceiued that an occasion was geuen to performe his enterprise,
incontinent he strake him with a hatchet on the head, so that he
could not speake, other standyng by shortly dispatched him of his life.
Diuers of his part, thinkyng him not dead, began to draw weapon, amongest
whom the lord Nouale was slaine, and the other taken. For
this murther were condempned (but not apprehended) by Parliament
the president of Prouynce, the vicount of Narbone, Guylliam Battelier,
Tauagny du Chastel, Robert Loyre and .iiii. other. This was the
ende of Ihon called the proude duke of Burgoyne, whiche more regarded
ciuile warre and intestine dissencion, then his owne life &amp; welfare.
And this sodein death as I thinke came to him not without desert, for
shamefully murtheryng Lewes duke of Orleance the French kynges
brother. Suche is the iustice of God, that bloud for the most part is recompensed
with bloud, &amp; vnnatural homicide is requited with shameful
death or soden destruction.
               
                  AFTER this heynous murder thus committed, I might reherse
how the dolphyns seruauntes despoyled the duke of all his garmētes
to his sherte, and couered his face with his hosen. I could declare how
the dolphyn sent his letters to Paris and other cyties and tounes, publishyng
vntruely diuers opprobrious wordes spoken, &amp; diuers great

and outragious offences done by the duke against the kyng and the
whole realme. I could further declare howe the wisemen of Fraunce
detested and abhorred this abhominable act, perceiuyng the ende that
was like to ensue, and how the contrary side, whiche was the linage of
Orleance reioysed and laughed at this miserable chaunce and sodain
fal: but because thenglish nacion was partie neither to the facte nor to
the counsel, I wyl declare what the kyng of Englande did after this
notorious dede done and committed.

                  WHen Philip erle Charoloys sōne and heyre to this duke
Ihon, and now by this murther and death of his father
duke of Burgoyn and earle of Flaūders was enformed
liyng at Gaunt of this misfortune and final ende of his
noble parent and louyng father, he toke the mater as he
had cause, greuously and heauily, insomuche that no mā
of his coūsel durst ones speake to him, and in especial the lady Michel
his wife, syster to the dolphyn and daughter to the kyng, was in great
feare to be forsaken and cast out of his house and fauoure: But as all
thinges ende, so sorow asswageth. When his doloure was somewhat
mitegate he fyrst by thaduise of his counseil receiued to his fauor and
company the fayre duches his louyng wife, and after sent diuers not able
ambassadours to the king of England liyng at Roan to treate and
conclude a peace betwene them both for a certaine space: To whiche request
in hope of a better chaunce kyng Henry agreed. After that knot
knit, he kept a solempne obsequy for his father at saint Uaas in Arras
where were .xxiii. prelates with crosses: Duryng whiche tyme the earle
of saint Paule and the Parisiens sent to him ambassadours to knowe
what they should do, and how they should defend them selues against
the Englishmen. He gently answered the messengers, that he trusted
shortly by the ayde of God and licence of the kyng to conclude a peace
and perpetual amitie to their great comfort &amp; relief. When these Ambassadors
wer departed to make relacion to the Magistrates and gouernors
of the cytie of Paris, he after long cōsultacion had aswel with
men of the spiritualtie as temporal and lay persons, sent the bishop of
Arras and two notable persons to the kyng of England with certaine
articles and clauses whiche the duke of Burgoyn offred to him for very
loue as he sayd. The kyng of England consideryng with him selfe
that the duke of Burgoyn was a cōuenient organe and a necessary instrument
to conueigh his desires to his purpose, louyngly receiued &amp;
honorably entertained the dukes ambassadours, declaryng vnto them
that he would without prolongyng of tyme send to him his Ambassadours,
whiche should open his lawful requestes &amp; reasonable desires.
With this answere, the dukes messengers departed towarde Arras.
and incontinent after their departure, kyng Henry sent the earle of

Warwike and the bishop of Rochestre with many knightes &amp; esquiers
to the duke of Burgoyn, whiche to him declared the effect and purpose
of their ambassade and cōmyng: he gently heard their requestes, and
some he alowed and some he augmented, and some he altred and disalowed,
but in cōclusion, by often sendyng betwene the kyng &amp; the duke
they were agreed, so the kyng and his cōmons would assent. Now was
the Frenche kyng and the quene and his daughter Katherin at Troys
in Champaigne, gouerned and ordred by them whiche would rather x.
tymes spurre forward the purpose &amp; ententes of the duke of Burgoyn
then once with a bridle to pul backe any one iote preferred by him.
               What should I say, a truce tripertited betwene the .ii. kynges and the
duke and their countreys was determined, so that the kyng of Englād
shuld send in the cōpany of the duke of Burgoyn his Ambassadors to
Troy in Chāpaigne sufficiently authorised to cōclud so great a matter
The kyng of England beyng in good hope that al his affaires should
prosperously succede and go forward, sent to the duke of Burgoyn his
vncle the duke of Exceter, the earle of Salsbury, the bishop of Ely, the
lord Fanhope and lord Fitzhugh, sir Ihon Robsert and sir Philip Hal
with diuers doctors to the nombre of .CCCCC. horse, whiche in the cō
                  pany
of the duke of Burgoyn came to the cytie of Troys the .xxi. daye
of Marche. The kyng, the quene and the lady Katherin them receiued
and heartely welcōmed, shewyng great signes and tokens of loue and
amitie. After a fewe daies they fel to counsel, in the whiche it was cō
                  cluded
that kyng Henry of England should come to Troys and mary
the lady Katherin, and the kyng should make him heyre of his realme,
croune and dignitie after his death and departure out of this natural
life with many other articles whiche hereafter in a place more conuenient
you shal heare reher

                  VVHEN all these thynges were done and concluded, the Ambassadors
or England departed toward their kyng, leuyng behynde thē sir
Ihon Robsert to geue his attendaunce on the lady Katherin. When
kyng Henry had heard his Ambassadors reherse the articles and pointes
of the treatie and amitie concluded, he condiscended &amp; agreed with
all diligence to set toward Troys, lōgyng for the sight of his darlyng
the fayre lady Katherin. And althoughe he reioysed that all thynges
succeded more luckely to his purpose then he before imagined, yet he
trusted not somuche to the glosyng wordes and golden promises of the
Frenche nacion beyng his auncient enemies, that he would rashely auenture
his person without a perfite serch and diligent inquirie of the
doynges and attemptes of his doubtful and newe reconciled frendes,
beyng warned and admonished by the late mischance of Ihon duke of
Burgoyn yet recent in euery mans eye. But when he sawe the sunne
shyne and ayre clere on euery syde, he accompanied with the dukes of
Clarence and Gloucester his brethren, the earles of Warwike, Salsbury,
Huntyngdon, Ewe, Tankeruile and Lōguile and .xv. thousand

men of warre, departed from Roan to Ponthoyse, and from thence to
sainct Denis two leagues from Paris, and from thence to Pontcharenton
where he left a garison of menne to kepe the passage, and from
thence by Prouynce, he came toward Troys, where the duke of Burgoyn
accompaignied with many noble men receiued hym two leagues
without the toune and cōueighed hym to his lodgyng and his princes
with hym, and all his armie was lodged in small villages theraboute.
And after he had reposed himself, he went to visete the kyng, the quene
and the Lady Katheryn, whom he founde in Sainct Peters Churche,
where was a ioyous metyng, honourable receiuyng and a louyng embrasyng
on bothe partes, whiche was the twenty daie of Maie. And
ther wer the kyng and the lady Katherin made sure together before the
high Aultare, and on the third daie of Iune nexte folowyng, thei were
with all solempnite espoused and maried in thesame Churche. At whiche
mariage the Englishmen made suche triumphes, pompes and pagiauntes
as though the kyng of all the worlde had been present. In so
muche (as three Frenche writers affirme) that the nobles of Fraunce
more merueled at the honor and glory of the Englishmen, then thei disdeigned
or maligned at their owne fortune.
               
                  AND when these solempne ceremonies wer honorably finished and
the mariage consummate, the twoo kynges and their counsaill assembled
together diuerse daies, wherin the former league and treatie was
in diuerse poyntes altred and brought to a certaintie by the deuice of
the kyng of Englande and his brethren. When this great matter was
finished, the kynges sware for their part to obserue this agrement and
league in all poynctes. Likewise sware the Duke of Burgoyne and a
great nombre of princes and nobles whiche were presente, and that the
soner because thei marueiled before at his noble Actes dooen by kyng
Henry, of whom thei had knowledge only by report, and now thei more
marueled when thei sawe and beheld the honor, estate &amp; wisedom of his
persone. But whether thei sware with outwarde countenaunce and inwardly
thought the contrary, let them whiche knowe the Frenche constancy
iudge and tell truthe. But assuredly thei perceiued hym to bee
prudent bothe in askyng and geuyng counsaill. Thei sawe hym expert
and apt to marciall feates, and nymble in all thynges apperteignyng
to warre. Thei thought hym strong against all perelles and imagined
hym fortunate in all chaunces and doynges, wherfore as I saied, thei
muche marueled at hym, and more regarded his persone. Then was he
named and proclaimed heire &amp; Regent of Fraunce. And as the French
kyng sent the copie of this treaty to euery toune in Fraūce, so the kyng
of Englande sent thesame in Englishe to euery citee and market toune
to bee published and deuulged, the very copie whereof as it was then
written, woorde by woorde ensueth.

                     HERE I ought not to forget howe .ii. men named learned in bothe
the lawes, the one called master Ihon Bouchet the Aquitanical writer
&amp; Archedeacon of Terbe, &amp; the other Master de Prato a solempne prothonotary
his pratyng gloser, wrote o
                        •
                      this treaty and composiciō, and
make therof so a great matter as by the makyng of this peace it shuld
appeare that England had no right to Fraūce, nor by this graunt nothyng
to England was geuen. Fyrst Ihon Bouchet saieth that this
treaty was the worst cōtract that euer was made for the kynges of England,

for by this saith he it is apparant that the kyng of Englād hah
neither tytle nor right to the croune of Fraunce but by this cōposicion,
for if they had right, why did thei take it by cōposicion? vpon this text
Master gloser saieth, that this composicion geueth a new right, and if
there wer any old it taketh it away and geueth a new, whiche new gift
was of litle value and lesse afficacie in the law because the issue female
may not enherite accordyng to the lawe Salique, &amp; therfore he cannot
make his doughter heyre to the croune of Fraunce. If I might be so
bold I wold axe Maister Ihon Bouchet this question: if a mā wrongfully
kepe me out of the possession of my true and lawful inheritaunce
(with whom I am neither able with purse neither with power to prosecute
my cause before a competent iudge by proces of the lawe) wyll of
his owne mere mocion (moued paraduenture with conscience) render
to me my right, so I wyl suffre him to enioy my lande duryng his life,
or that I wyl mary his daughter, haue I this land by his gift or as a
thyng to me iustly by law and equitie rendred and receiued. Lykewise
if a riche man owe to a poore man an hundreth poundes, whiche is not
able in substance or for feare of displeasure dare not attempt any suyte
or quarel against his detter, if he wyl offer to pay his money at dayes,
to the whiche request the poore man agreeth, is this a newe gift of the
money or a payment of the det. In the fyrst question if the demaūdant
had no tytle, how could he graunt to him the accion of the land duryng
his life, and in the second, if the plaintiffe had none interest how could
he geue him daies of payment and yet in both the cases if the one part
had no right why would the other make an offre or cōpound, for all cō
                     posicions
haue respect to a right precedent. But in this matter, who
would iudge that a kyng of so great &amp; puissant a realme with the assēt
of his whole counsel would dishenerite his onely sonne &amp; surrendre his
title without an apparant right and open tytle knowen and shewed by
the partie, for the olde prouerbe sayeth, long sufferaunce is no acquittance,
nor prolongyng of tyme derogacion to right, also restitucion is
no graūt, nor payment of duetie is no gift. Doctors write and clerkes
afferme that these treaties, arbitrementes and composicions be bothe
godly, charitable and honest, both to restore the one partie to his auncient
right (whether it be in landes or goodes) and to dispence &amp; releue
the other with the takyng of the profites of the land and vsyng in marchandies
the occupacion of the money. Now to Master gloser whiche
affirmeth that a composicion taketh away an old right &amp; geueth a new
and that this cōposicion is of no value: surely Master Ihon de Prato
I would haue suche a peuyshe proctor reteined against me, for you say
that euery cōposicion geueth a new right and taketh away the aunciēt
title, yet you sayd before y• this cōposicion neither geueth nor can geue
any right, whiche cōclucion is manifestly repugnant to the antecedent
therfore you must be answered thus, if nothyng be geuen, nothyng is
taken away, &amp; so consequently no cōposicion, &amp; if there be no cōposicion

then remaineth styl the olde and auncient tytle in the state that it was.
Paraduenture Master gloser wyl say and allege the tytle of England
to be abrogated because the house of Ualoys may lawfully prescribe against
the kynges of England and haue had the possession fortie yeres
and more, &amp; so by this meane kyng Hēry had no tytle to clayme or chalenge
any part of the realme of Fraunce. Then I pray you remember
the yeres &amp; accompt the doynges and you shal euidently perceiue that
king Edward the third the very indubitate heyre general to the croune
of Fraunce Kyng Richard the second, kyng Henry the fourth and this
noble kyng Henry the fift neuer desisted .vi. or .viii. yeres at the moost
either by battaile or treatie to chalenge and clayme their aūcient right
and old enheritaunce to thē by quene Isabel discended, so the title was
euer in strife and neuer quiet tyll nowe the right lyne is restored: And
as for your law Salique put it in your boget among lyes &amp; fayned fables.
Thus you may se the affections of Frenchemen, that an Archefoole
cannot forge a lye for his pleasure, but a 
                        •
                     rothodawe wyll faine a
glose to mainteine his folish fātasie. Let vs now leue these wylful writers
and returne to the kyng of England, whiche after al the
                        •
                     e articles
of the treaty beyng concluded and sworne, made the Frenche kyng, the
duke of Burgoyn and other the Frenche lordes a solempne and sumptuous
supper and banket, and before their departyng, he sadly and soberly
sayd to them these wordes.
                  All my thought care &amp; study is (you noble princes &amp; men of high honor)
to inuent the meane, study &amp; way, how both my kyngdomes by the
benefite of almightie God enlarged &amp; amplified, by the cō
                     
                        •
                     exyng &amp; ioynyng
the one to the other may be left to my posteritie clene &amp; pure with
out domestical dissēcion or ciuile discorde, to thentent that as no prince
nor potestate hath at this day in al Europe a greater gouernance, a richer
regiment nor a more puissant empire: So I trust to leue it that
hereafter ther shal no power or dominion be able to be to it cōpared or
equyuolent. Wherfore, I entende fyrst to extirpate &amp; plucke away the
rotes and leuynges of the ciuile discēcion in this realme lately begon,
whiche ly in the brest of Charles the kynges sōne, by your decre, iudgement
and assent, of the newe state and dignitie of the dolphyn vtterly
depriued and disgraded, against whom it is cōuenient and decent that
you beare armure not so muche to destroy &amp; confound him, as to bring
him to do obaysance and reasonable cōformitie. What maner a prince
thinke you he would proue, when he should obtaine &amp; possesse a kyngdome,
which beyng but a lusty yong striplyng not fearyng God nor regardyng
his honor contrary to his promise &amp; against all humaine honestie,
was not ashamed to polute and staine him selfe with the bloud
and homicide of the valeaunt duke of Burgoyn, O cancard stomacke
in the brest of a yong prince, oh tyrannical heart in the body of a gentle
men, O vntrue tong in the mouth of a Christen men, a Christian, no a
Pagane whiche neglecting his honor, violatyng his promise and dispisyng

honestie, would procure or cōsent to so abhominable a fact and
sedicious a murder. Wherfore these thynges wel pondered and iustly
considered I require you to ioyne, stand, and cleue with me as the very
heyre &amp; successor of my dere &amp; welbeloued father in lawe king Charles
in this realme &amp; kyngdome, fyrst to my noble auncesters, &amp; after to me
by right title and iust clayme lawfully discended. Grudge not I pray
you because I that am an Englishman shall succede in the croune of
Fraūce: I assure you I am not nor wil not be noted to be to you a mere
alien and straunger, was not my great grandfather kyng Edward the
third sōne to quene Isabel daughter to Philip the fayre and sister and
heyre to .iii. kynges of this relme dead without issue? was not my great
graundmother quene Philip discended of the noble house of Ualoys?
if the old &amp; trite prouerbe be true that the womans side is the surer side
and that the childe foloweth the wombe, although the one part be Englishe
yet the surer part is Frenche, and of the Frenche floure budded &amp;
brought furth. And therfore remembre not that I am an Englishe mā,
put out of your mindes in what coūtrey I was borne: and cōsider that
I am a christen man &amp; an anoynted kyng, to whō by both the professions
it apperteineth not onely to defend &amp; protect their people and subiectes
from forein powers &amp; outward inuasions, but also to minister
to them indifferent iustice, to conserue them in pollitike ordre and moderate
quietnes: and finally, accordyng to their desert and merites, thē
to promote, auance &amp; prefer to riches, honors and estates: whiche thinges
if I would not do to you my trusty frendes whose louyng heartes
and beneuolent myndes I shall neuer forgette nor put in obliuion, I
should not do my dutie to God, I shuld not do the office of a kyng, nor
I shuld not do that whiche by the lawes of nature and reason I ought
to do, which is to rendre kyndnes for kyndnes, goodnes for desert, and
honor for merite. Therfore to cōclude I humbly require you, to stande
strong with kyng Charles my father in lawe (who in the stede of myne
owne parent I worship, loue and honor) in this concord and agrement
whiche I both cal &amp; trust to be a peace final, and after his mortal ende
to loue, serue &amp; be true to me and my posteritie, and I assure you for my
part that the Occean sea shall soner leue his flowyng and the bright
sunne shal soner leue his shinyng, then I shall ceasse to do that whiche
becommeth a prince to do to his subiecte, or that a father ought to do
to his natural child.
                  
                     VVHEN he had thus persuaded the nobilitie, he with al his army,
hauyng with him that French kyng and the duke of Burgoyn came before
the toune of Sene in Burgoyn which toke part with the dolphyn:
and after that he had destroied the countrey about it, at the .xv. day the
toune was yelded and there he made capitain the lorde Ienuale. And
from thence he remoued to Monstreau Fault yone, where the duke of
Burgoyn was slain as you haue heard, whiche toune was takē by assault
and many of the dolphyns parte apprehended before they could

get to the castel. After the gettyng of the toune, the castle whiche was
newly replenished with men and vitayle, denied to rēdre, and so it was
strongly besieged: duryng whiche assault the duke of Burgoyn was
enformed by diuers in what place the duke his father was buried,
whose corps he caused to be taken vp &amp; sered and so cōueighed it to Diron
in high Burgoyn and buried it by duke Philip his father.
                  
                     THE kyng of England sent certaine of the prisoners that he had taken
in this toune to aduise the capitaine of the castle to yeld the same,
but they obstinatly denied the request, geuyng opprobrious wordes to
the kynges Herault, wherfore the kyng of Englād caused a gybbet to
be set vp before the castle, on the whiche were hanged .xii. prisoners all
gentlemen and frendes to the capitaine. When the lord of Guytry lieftenant
of the castle perceiued that by no meanes he could be succoured,
and fearyng to be taken by force, he beganne to treat with the kyng of
Englād, whiche in .viii. daies would take none of his offers, but in cō
                     clusion
he and his rendred them selues simply, their liues onely saued,
and after .vi. wekes siege the castle was deliuered, &amp; the earle of Warwike
was made capitaine of the toune and castle▪ whiche fortefied the
same with men, ordinance and artillerie. From thence the kyng of England
departed to Molyn vpon Seyne and besieged it round aboute

euery day was skyrmishyng, scalyng, &amp; assautyng, to the losse of bothe
parties, but most of al to the losse of thē within. Duryng whiche siege
the Frenche quene and the quene of England, and the duches of Burgoyn
came diuers tymes to visite their husbandes and se their frēdes,
whom the kyng of England so highly feasted, so louyngly entertained
and with so pleasant pastymes comforted them, that euery creature of
him reported honor, liberalitie, and gentlenes. This siege so long cōtinued
that vitayles within the toune began to fayle, and pestilence began
to growe, so that the capitaine began to treat, and in cōclusion the
toune was deliuered vpon certain condicions, wherof one was that al
that were concentyng to the death of the duke of Burgoyn should be
deliuered to the kyng, wherof the lorde Barbason was suspected to be
one, and so they wer deliuered to the kyng of England, whiche sent thē
vnder the conduyte of the duke of Clarence his brother to the cytie of

army to Corbeil, where the Frenche kyng and the two quenes then soiorned,
and from thence the .ii. kynges accompanied with the dukes of
Bedford, Burgoyn, Gloucester and Exceter, and therles of Warwike

Salisbury and a greate numbre of noble men and knightes set furthe
toward Paris, whom the citezens in good ordre met without the gates
and the Clergy also with solempne processiō, al the stretes wer hanged
with riche clothes &amp; the people in the stretes shouted and clapped handes
for ioye, the twoo kynges rode together, the kyng of Englande geuyng
the vpper hande to his father inlawe through the greate citee of
Paris to our Lady Churche, where after thei said there deuocions thei
departed to their lodgynges, the Frenche kyng to the hous of Sainct
Paule, &amp; the kyng of Englande to the Castle of Louure. The next day
the twoo Quenes made their entree into Paris and wer receiued with
like solempnite as their husbandes were the daie before. If I should
declare to you the greate giftes, the costly presentes, the plenty of vitaile
that was geuen to the kyng of Englande: or reherse how the conduites
abundantly spouted out wine of diuerse colours, or discribe the
costly pagiantes, the plesant songes or swete armony that wer shewed
song and plaied at diuerse places of the citie, or shewe the greate gladnes,
the hertie reioysyng and the greate delight that the comen people
had at this concorde and peace finall, I should reherse many thynges
that you would be weried bothe with the readyng and hearyng.
                  
                     DVRYNG the season that these .ii. kynges thus lay in Paris, there
was a greate assēble called, aswell of the spiritualtie as of the nobilitie
in the whiche the two kynges sat as iudges, before whom the Duches
of Burgoyn by her proctor appeled the Dolphin and .vii. other for the
murdre of duke Ihon her husband. To the whiche appele the coūsaill
of the other part made diuerse offers of amendes, aswell of foundaciōs
of priestes to praie for the solle, as recompence of money to the widowe
and children, for the finall determinaciō wherof the kynges toke a farther
deliberacion and apointed a farther daie. To the citee of Paris at
this tyme resorted the three estates of the realme, where euery persone
seuerally sware upō the holy Euangelistes to kepe, support, maintein,
and defende the treaty and peace finall whiche was concluded betwene
the twoo princes and their counsailes and therto euery noble man, spirituall
gouernor, and tēporall rulers set to their seales, whiche instrumentes
wer sent to the kynges treasury of his Exchequer at Westminster,
sauely to be kept wher thei yet remain. These two kinges so
                        •
                     orned
in Paris all the feaste of Christmas. The Frenche Kyng liyng at the
hous of S. Paule kept no estate nor open courte to no man except his
houshold seruauntes and men of base estate frequented his hous. But
the Kyng of Englande and his Quene, kepte suche solempne estate, so
plentifull a hous, so princely pastyme, and gaue so many gyftes that
from all partes of Fraunce, noble men and other resorted to his palice
to se his estate and dooe hym honor.
                  
                     THEN the kyng of England toke vpon hym as Regent of Fraūce
to redresse causes, remoue officers, reforme thynges that were a misse,
and caused a new coyne to be made called the Salute, where in wer the

Armes of Fraunce and the Armes of England and Fraūce quarterly.
And to set all thynges in a quietnes, he constituted sir Gilbert Um
                        •
                     reuile
capitain of Me
                        •
                     un with a good numbre of valiant souldiers, and
the erle of Huntyngdon his cosyn germain was deputed capitain at
Boys de Uincens, and the duke of Excester with .v.C. menne of warre
was assigned to kepe the citee and toune of Paris. When he had thus
ordered his affaires accordyng to his deuice &amp; ordre, he with the quene
his wife his princes and nobles departed from Paris and came to the
citie of Roan. But before his remouyng, he caused proces to be made against
Charles called the Dolphyn, cōmaundyng hym to apere at the
table of Marble at Paris, where 
                        •
                     or lacke of aperance he was with all
solempnitie in suche a cause requisite, denounced giltie of the murther
and homicide of Ihon late Duke of Bugoyne, and by the sentence of
the court of parliament he was exiled and banished the realme and territories
of Fraunce, and depriued of all honores, names, dignities and
preheminences whiche he then had or herafter might haue. Wherefore
the Dolphyn went into Lang
                        •
                     edoc and after to Poytiers gettyng to
hym suche frendes as he could, and in especiall he obteigned so highly
the fauor of therle of Arminack that he not onely toke his part, but also
releued hym with money, aided hym with men and in his owne persone
continually serued hym against his foes and enemies.
                  
                     VVHILE Kyng Henry soiorned in the citee of Roan, he receiued
homage of all the nobles of Normandy: emōgest whom therie of Stafford
did homage for the countie of Perche, and Arthur of Britayn did
homage for the countie of Yury, whiche the kyng before had geuen to
them. He also ordeined his leuetenaunt generall bothe of Fraunce and
Normandy his brother Thomas duke of Clarence, and his deputie in
Normandy was the erle of Salisbury. When the feast of Christmas
(whiche he kept with all triumphe and solemptie in his castle of Roan)
was passed, he with the quene his wife departed from Roan to Amiēs
and so came to Caleis where he toke ship the morow after Candelmas
daie and landed at Douer, and came to Eltham and so through Londō
to Westminster. Meruel it is to write but more meruel it was to se,
with what ioy, what triumphe, what solace and what reioisyng he was
receiued of al his subiectes, but in especiall of the Lōdoners, which for
tediousnesse I ouer passe. And no doubt Englande had greate cause to
reioyce at the coming of suche a noble capitain, so valiant a prince and
so mightie a conqueror, whiche in so small space and so briefe tyme had
brought vnder his obeysance the greate &amp; puissant realme &amp; dominion
of Fraunce. And first to rendre to God his creator moste hūble &amp; hertie
thankes, he caused solempne processions to be obserued &amp; kept .v. daies
together in euery citee and toune: After that doen he made greate purueighance
of all thynges necessary for the coronacion of his Quene &amp;
spouse the faire lady Katheryn, whiche was doen the daie of .s. Mathy
the .xxiiij. daie of February, on whiche solēpne feast she was cōueighed

on fote betwene .ii. bishops vnder a riche ca

                     apie frō the great halle at
Westminster to. S. Peters churche, &amp; there she was anoynted &amp; crouned
with al ye ceremonies to so great an estate aperteinyng or requisite. After
whiche solēpnitie ended, she was again with great pōpe cōueighed
in to westminster hall &amp; ther set in ye throne at the table of marble at the
vpper end of the hall: whose seruice and solēpnite who so list to rede let
him loke on the Chronicle of Robert Fabiā which declareth it at large.

and from thēce departed into the countrie of Mayne, and
at Pount de gene he passed the riuer of Youe and rode through all the

                  THE duke of Clarence had a Lomberd resortyng to hym called Andrewe
Forgusa was retained with the part aduerse, of whom the duke
inquired the nūbre of his enemies, to whō he reported that their numbre
was but small and of no strength and far vnmete to compare with
halfe the power of his puissaunt armie, entisyng and prouokyng hym
to set on the Frenchmen, warrātyng hym a famous victory and a faire
daie. The duke geuyng to muche credite to this traytor, like a valiant
and coragious prince assembled together al the horssemen of his army
and lefte the Archers behynde hym vnder the ordre of the Bastarde of
Clarence and two Portyngales capitaines of Fresnye le Uicount, saiyng
that he onely and the nobles would haue the honor of that iorney.
When the duke was passed a straight and a narowe passage, he espied
his enemies ranged in good ordre of battaill by the monicion of the
Lombard whiche had sold hym to his enemies, and thesaid aduersaies
had laied suche bushementes at the straightes that the duke by no wayes
without battaill could ether retire or 
                     •
                  lie. The Englishemen seyng
no remedy valiauntly set on their enemies whiche wer foure to one, the
battail was 
                     •
                  ierce and the fight dedly, neuer wer so fewe men seen more
coragiously to defend theimselfes then did the Englishemen that daie
thei fought and defēded, the slewe and felled, but it auailed not, for thei
wer repressed with a multitude and brought to confusion. There were
slain the duke of Clarence, therle of Tankeruile, the Lorde Rosse, Sir
Gilbert U
                     •
                  ffreuile erle of Kent, and sir Ihon Lumley, sir Robert Uerend
and almoste two thousande Englishmen, and therles of Somerset
Suffolke and Perche, the Lorde Fitizwater, sir Ihon Barkeley, sir
Rauffe Neuell, sir Henry Iuglos, sir Willyam Bowes, sir Willyam
Longton, sir Thomas a Borough and diuerse other taken prisoners,
and of the Frenchemen wer slain aboue .xij.C. of the best men of warre
so that thei gained not muche. The Bastard of Clarence whiche taried
at Beauford was enformed of the numbre of the Frenchmen, wherfore
he with all the Archers made hast to succor the Duke, but thei came to
late, for the Frenchmen hearyng of the approchyng of the Archers fled
with their prisoners with all the hast thei could, leuyng behynde theim
the bodie of thesaid duke and the ded carions. When the archers came
and sawe their enemies gone: Lorde how thei mourned &amp; lamented the
euell chance of the deceiued duke, but seyng no remedy, thei tooke the
ded bodies and buried theim all sauyng the dukes corps, whiche with
great solempnitie was sent into Englande and buried at Cantorbury
beside his father. After this the Englishemen brente and spoyled the

countrie of Mayne and so returned to Alaunson and there departed euery
man to his Garrison. This battail was fought at Bawgy in Aniow
on Easter euen in the yere of our Lorde a thousande .CCCC.xxj.
               
                  I lament the foly and foolishenes of this duke and I maruell at his
vnwitty doyng and rashe enterprise, that he would aduenture his life
and hazarde his compaignie leuyng behynde hym the Archers whiche
should haue been his shilde and defence: What maie be said, he desired
honor and loste his life, he coueted victory and was ouercome, thus is
the old prouerbe verified whiche saieth: If shepe ronne wilfully emongest
Wolues thei shall lese ether life or fell.
               
                  KYNG Henry beyng aduertised of this infortunate chance and deceatfull
losse of his louyng brother, sent
                     •
                   without delaie Edmond erle
of Mortaigne and brother to therle of 
                     •
                  omerset into Normandy, geuyng
to hym like authoritee &amp; preheminence as his brother the late deceassed
duke of Clarence had or enioyed. After that he called his highe
courte of Parliamente, in the whiche he declared so wisely, so seriously
and with so greate a grauitie the actes that wer dooen in the realme of
Fraūce, the estate of the tyme presente and what thynges wer necessary
for the tyme to come (if thei would looke to haue that Iewell and high
kyngdō for the whiche thei had so long labored and sought for) that the
comonaltie gladly graunted a fiftene, and the Clergy beniuolently offred
a do
                     •
                  le disme, and because no delay should be in the kynges affaires
for lacke of paiment, the bishoppe of Wynchester his vncle lent to
hym .xx.M. pounde, to be receiued of thesame dismes. When all thynges
necessary for this voyage wer ready and prepared, he sent his brother
Ihon duke of Bedford with all his armie (whiche the Frenchmen
write to be .iiii.M. men of Armes and .xx.M. Archers and other) before
hym to Caleis. And he himself shortly after in the middle of Maie
passed the seas and arriued there in greate triūphe, where to hym was
shewed that the Dolphyn with .vij.M. men had besieged the toune of
Chartiers whiche was manfully defended by the Bastarde of Thyan
and other set and apoynted there by the duke of Excester. Kyng Henry
not myndyng to lose so faire a toune, with all his Armie departed in
good ordre of battaill toward Paris, and at Mōstreull there receiued
hym the duke of Burgoin, whiche frō that place attended on the kyng
to Dowast in Ponthiew and so came to Abbeuile, and after the Kyng
tooke a toune of sir Iaques of Herecort called a Ferte, and there the
duke departed from the kyng for a sixe daies promisyng on his honor
by that daie to returne, the kyng of Englande passed forwarde by Beauuoys
Gisors, and from thence came to Boys de Uincens where he
founde the Frenche kyng and his Quene, whom he louyngly saluted
and thei him again honorably receiued and highly feasted, and thether
came accordyng to his appoyntment Philip duke of Burgoyn, where
was daily consultyng and he wisely deuisyng howe to subdue and represse
the haultnes and force of the Dolphyn, hauyng perfight knowledge

that as long as he ether liued or wandered vnbrideled so long
should neuer the treaty and finall peace be obserued, wherefore he and
the duke of Burgoyn apoynted in all the haste to fight with the Dolphyn
and to reise the siege before Charters. The Kyng of Englande
with all his puyssaunce came to the toune of Naunte, and thether repaired
the duke of Burgoyn with .iiii.M. men, of whose commyng the
king was not alitle reioysed, but or thei from thence departed, thei had
knowledge and true instruccion that the Dolphyn heryng of the puissant
army of the kyng, approchyng to geue hym battail, was reculed
with his people toward Towers in Towrayne. Wherfore the kyng of
England incontinent, not onely sent the duke of Burgoyn into Picardy
to resist the malice of sir Iaques Harcort whiche daily inferred war
and caused wast &amp; destrucciō in thesame coūtrie, but also apointed Iames
kyng of Scottes to laie siege to the toune of Driex, whiche so sore
by sworde and engins enforced the inhabitantes that after sixe wekes
passed, thei deliuered thesame to the kyng of Scottes, to the behofe of
Kyng Henry his souereigne Lorde whiche made there of capitain the
exle of Worcester and baily there, sir Henry Mortimer. The king him
self remoued from Naūt and passed ouer the riuer of Leyre, folowyng
the Dolphyn toward Tours: but he mistrustyng his power and puttyng
diffidēce in some of his owne flocke fled to Burges in Berrie, and
chosyng that place as his chiefe refuge and surest fortresse bothe for
the situacion of the place and also for the fidelitie and constancie of the
people, determined there to tary till fortune would turne her whele
and loke on hym with some gracious looke or louyng countenaunce,
and therfore in a Iest he was comonly called the kyng of Burges and
of Berries. The kyng of Englande with all his puissance so fast folowed
the fliyng Dolphyn, that vitail began to faile, and horssemen waxed
scante: so that he consideryng that Burges beeyng the Dolphyns
onely succoure and refuge, beeyng well vitailed and well manned
was more proffitable and auailable to the defender, then to hym that
should make the assaute, wherfore he willyng to saue his people from
famyne whom he knewe to be from the dent of the Frenche sworde clerely
exempt and vntouched, returned ouer the riuer of Leyre and gat
Gasconeis vpon Youne, and a toune called the Kynges Newe toune,
and diuerse other whose names nowe to reherce were more tedious
then pleasaunt. But he seyng the toune of Meaux in Brye not to bee a
toune replenished with enemies, in the middest of his new gotten subiectes
determined to take awaie the open scruple whiche might poyson
and infecte the membres dwellyng hard by, wherfore he with these nobles
folowyng besieged thesaid citee of Meaux.

                  THIS toune was no lesse vitailed then manned, and no better manned
then fortified, so that the kyng of Englande could nether haue it to
hym deliuered at his pleasure, nor he could not gayne it by assaut with
out his greate losse and detriment. Wherfore he determined not to depart
til he had ether gained or subuerted the toune. Duryng this siege
was borne at Wynsore on the daie of. S. Nicholas in Nouember the
kynges sonne called Henry, whose Godfathers wer Ihon duke of Bedford
and Henry bishop of Wynchester, and Iaquet Duches of Holād
was Godmother, wherof the kyng of Englande was certefied liyng at
this siege of Meaux. Whē he was aduertised of this good fortune and
happie chaunce that God had sent him a sonne, he gaue thankes to his
Creator or redemer for the geuyng to hym so goodly an Ympe whiche
should succede in his croune &amp; scepter. But when he heard reported the
place of his natiuitie, whether he fantasied some old blind prophesy, or
had some foreknowledge, or els iudged of his sōnes fortune, he sayd to
the lord Fitzheugh his trusty Chamberlein these wordes. My lorde, I
Henry borne at Monmoth shall small tyme reigne &amp; muche get, &amp; Hēry
borne at Wyndsore shall long reigne and al lese, but as God will so be
it. After the quene of Englande was thus deliuered of her faire sonne
she returned into Fraunce first to her husbande, and after to her father
and mother where she was on all partes so honorably receiued, so louyngly
entertained and so highly feasted that she appeared to be no
lesse loued of her noble husbande then of her naturall parentes.
            
            
               ¶The tenth yere.
               
                  OUryng the tyme of this siege, sir Oliuer Manye a valiant
man of warre of the Dolphyns part, whiche before was capitain
of the Castle of Faloys and yeldyng it by composicion,
sware neuer to bere Armure against the kyng of Englande,
assembled a greate numbre of men of warre aswell
of Britons as Frenchemen, that is to saie: The lorde Mountburchier,
the lorde of Coynon, the lorde of Chastelgiron, the lorde Tyntignace,
the lorde Dela Howssay and diuerse other whiche entered into the coū
                  tree
of Constantine in Normandy, and robbed and killed the Englishmen
where thei might ether espie or take theim at their auauntage: but
therle of Suffolk keper of those Marches hearyng of their doynges,
sent for the lorde Scales, Sir Ihon Aston bayly of Constantine, Sir

Willyam Halle, sir Ihon Banaster and many other out of the Errisons
within that territory, whiche encountered with their enemies at a
place called le Parke Leuecque in Englishe the bishops Parke, ther was
a sore and a long fight, many a propre feate of Armes was dooen that
daie and many a man was in that place ouerthrowen, the Englishmen
onely desired victory, and the Frenchmen desired a safe returne, but in
cōclusion the Frenchmen beyng not able to withstand the charge that
was laied to them began to flie, in whiche conflict and flight wer slain,
the lorde Coynon, the lorde of Castell Giron, and three hundred other
and there wer taken prisoners, the lorde Dela Howsay and sir Oliuer
Manny and .lx. other. The kyng being aduertised of this good chance
and happy iorney, sent sir Oliuer Manny to hym liyng before Meux,
to whom he saied, faire father you haue sworne and promised vnto vs
that you would neuer make war nor beare armure against vs nor our
subiectes, ye are an aūcient knight and ought to haue kept your faith
and promise, whiche you haue vntruly and vnhonestly broken and violate,
and yet we wolle not (although by the lawe of armes we might
lawfully so dooe) put you to death but graunt to you your life, but we
wolle sende you into Englande to lerne you to speake Englishe, and so
shortly after he was sent to London where for very shame &amp; mere Malyncoly
he died and was buried in the White Friers.
               
                  THE Scottes write (beleue theim if ye will) that the Kyng of England
hearyng that the Dolphyn had sent for aide into Scotland and
that he had retained theim in wages (for of their owne abilitie thei bee
nether able to send an army ouer the sea, nor yet of substaunce to beare
a continuall warre, for this all their owne histories declare and their
Chronicles make mencion, and yet the countrie is not so poore but the
people be as proude) sent one daie for Iames the Scottishe kyng and
in the presence of his coūsaill declared to hym what humanite, what fauor
and what synguler affeccion kyng Henry his father bare duryng
his naturall life toward thesaid kyng of Scottes: Puttyng hym in remembraunce
of the greate loue and manifold gratuites whiche he him
self sithe the beginnyng of his reigne had exhibited and shewed to the
same kyng Iames, that nether he nor his father had any thyng negligently
omitted whiche ether might apperteigne to the office of a frend
or to the dutie of a tutor whiche should loue and cherishe his Orphane
or pupile, promisyng hym libertie with a greate rewarde if he would
cause the Scottes whiche wer adherentes to the Dolphin to returne a
gain into their countree and natiue region. To the whiche request the
kyng of Scottes with a very freshe herte answered saiyng: what your
noble father hath dooen to me &amp; what fauor &amp; benefite I haue receiued
at your handes, I shall not nor will not when I maie (I assure you)
forget, and when my power shall serue I shall not faile to recompence
your dooynges with like kyndnes. But of your request I maruell not
alitle, firste consideryng that I am a prisoner and haue no possession of

my realme, secōdarely that I am as yet nether sworne to my subiectes,
nor thei by no oth of allegeance are boūd to obey my cōmaundemētes:
wherfore I desyre you no more to moue me inthis thyng which now I
cānot do, &amp; yet if I might I would fyrst forese whether it wer to me honorable
or to my realme honest to leue our old frend in his extreme necessitie
without ayd or cōfort. With this answer the kyng of England
was not cōtent (as the Scottes say), but after kyng Iames departing
fro his presence, kyng Henry saied, happy shall they bee whiche shalbe
subiectes to suche a kyng that is endued with suche wit and wisedome
at these yong yeres of age.
               
                  THE kyng of England liyng styl before the toune of Meux in Brye
as you haue heard sore bet the walles with ordinance &amp; cast doune bulwarkes
and rampeyres on euery syde of the toune, and sore oppressed
them within the toune, wherof hearyng the lord of Offemond, with a
cōpany of chosen persons sēt by the dolphyn, came priuely in the night
to the walies and set vp a ladder and diuers of his company mounted
vp and entred into the toune, and as he passed ouer a plancke to come
to the walles he fel into a deepe ditche, the Englishemen hearyng this
noyse ranne to the ditche where they toke the lord of Ofmount &amp; slewe
diuers of his company whiche stode at defence. The capitaine within
the toune perceiuyng that their succours were taken, playnely iudged
that the toune could not long continue, wherfore they caused all
the goodes of the toune to be conueighed into the market place, which
was strong and wel fortefied. The kyng of England beyng therof aduertised,
cōmaunded in all hast to geue an assault to the toune, whiche
was quickly done, so that the toune by fine force was within thre houres
taken &amp; spoyled. And the same day the kyng besieged round about
the sayd Marketplace, and toke the mylle adioynyng to the same.
The capitaines perceiuyng in what case they were, fearyng to be taken
by assault, began to treat with the kyng of Englande, whiche appointed
the earle of Warwike and the lord Hungerford to cōmen with
them &amp; in conclusicion a treaty was taken, and so the toune and Marketplace
with all the goodes, were deliuered into the kyng of Englandes
handes the .x. day of May, in the yere of our lord M.CCCC.xxii.
               
                  VVHEN the deliuery of the strong toune of Meaux was published
thorough the countrey, al the tounes and fortresses in the Isle of
Fraunce, in Lannoys, in Brye, and in Champaine yelded them selues
to the kyng of England, which appointed in them valeant capitaines
and hardy souldiers.
               
                  AFTER that kyng Henry had thus taken and possessed the toune
of Meaux and other fortresses at his pleasure, he returned againe to
Boys de Uyncennes where he founde the Frenche kyng &amp; the quene &amp;
his wife whiche with all ioye him receiued, and so the .xxx. day of May
beyng the vigile of Pentecost, the .ii. kynges and the quenes returned
to Paris, wher the kyng of Englād lodged in the castle of Loure, and

and that onely by reason of bodely labour &amp; vnquietnes of mynde, frō
the whiche no smal noyse coulde awake him, insomuche that when his
souldiers either sang in the nightes or their minstreles played that all
the campe soūded of their noyse, he then slept most soūdly. His courage
was so constant and his heart so vnmutable that he cast away al feare,
and dread frō him was banished. If any alarum wer made by his enemies,
he was fyrst in armure and the fyrst that would set forwarde. In
the time of war he gat knowledge, not onely what his enemiesdid, but
what thei sayd and entended, so that al thynges to him were knowen, &amp;
of his deuices few persons before the thing was at the point to be done
should be made priuie. He had suche knowledge in orderyng and guydyng
an armye and suche a grace in encouragyng his people, that the
Frenchmen sayd he could not be vāquished in battel. He had suche wit
suche prudence and suche pollicie that he neuer enterprised any thyng
before he had fully debated it and foresene al the mayne chaunces that
might happen: and when the end was concluded, he with all diligence
and courage set his purpose forward. Marueile it is to heare howe he
beyng a prince of honor, a prince of youth, a prince of riches, did continually
abstain frō lasciuious liuyng &amp; blynd auarice, yea, &amp; in the time
of losse he was no more sad then in the time of victory, whiche constācy
few men haue or can vse: Suche a stable stomacke had he and suche a
grauitie was geuen in the bottome of his heart. What pollicy he had
in findyng sodaine remedies for present mischiefes, and what practice
he vsed in sauyng him selfe and his people in sodaine distresses excepte
by his actes they did plainly appeare, I thinke it were almost a thyng
incredible. What should I speake of his bountefulnes and liberalitie
no man could be more gentle, more liberal nor more free in geuyng rewardes
to al persons accordyng to their desertes: Saiyng that he had
leuer dye thē to be subiect to auarice, and that he neuer desired to haue
money to kepe, but to geue and spend. He was mercyful to offenders,
charitable to the nedy, indifferent to al men, faithful to his frēdes, and
fierce to his enemies, toward God most deuout, toward the world moderate,
and to his realme a very father. What should I say, he was
the blasyng comete and apparant lanterne in his daies, he was the
myrror of Christendome &amp; the glory of his countrey, he was the floure
of kynges passed, and a glasse to them that should succede. No Emperor
in magnanimitie euer him excelled. No potentate was more piteous
nor lorde more bounteous, No prince had lesse of his subiectes
and neuer kyng cōquered more: whose fame by his death as liuely florisheth
as his actes in his lifewer sene and remēbred. When his death
was published among the cōmen people, incōtinent their heartes wer
appalled and their courages abated, their dolor so muche encreased &amp;
their wittes were so muche troubled that they like mad men rent their
garmentes and tare their heere, accusyng and blamyng fortune which
had taken away from them so precious a iewel, so noble an ornament &amp;

so sure a defence: for no doubt as muche hope as was taken awaye frō
the Englishmen, for the gettyng of Fraunce by his sodaine death, so
muche trust was encreased in the stomackes of the Frenche nacion, hopyng
to recouer their aūcient libertie and olde parentage. For whiche
cause some say that he was poysoned, the Scottes write that he died of
the disease of s. Fiacre, whiche is a palsey &amp; a crāpe. Enguerant sayeth
that he died of S. Anthonies Fier, but al these be but fables as many
mo write. For Peter Basset esquire which at the time of his death was
his chāberlain affirmeth that he died of a Plurisis whiche at that tyme
was so rare a sickenes and so straūg a disease that the name was to the
most part of mē vnknowen &amp; phisicions wer acquainted as lytle with
any remedy for the same, and therfore euery mā iudged as he thought,
and named a sickenes that he knew, shotyng not nere the pricke nor vnderstandyng
the nature of the disease. This kyng reigned .ix. yeres .v.
monethes and .xxiii. dayes &amp; liued not ful .xxxviii. yeres: he was of stature
more then the cōmen sort, of body lene, wel mēbred &amp; strōgly made
a face beautiful somwhat long necked, blacke heered, stout of stomake
eloquent of tong, in marcial affaires a very doctor, &amp; of al chiualry the
very Paragone, His body was enbaumed &amp; closed in lede &amp; layde in a
charet royal richely apparaled with cloth of gold, vpon the corps was
layd a representacion of his person adorned with robes, diademe, scepter
&amp; bal like a kyng, the which charet was drawē with .vi. horses richely
trapped with seueral armes, the fyrst with the armes of S. George,
the .ii. with tharmes of Normandy, the .iii. with the armes of kyng Arthur,
the: iiii. with the armes of S. Edward, the fift with the armes of
Fraunce onely, and the sixt with the armes of England and Fraunce,
On this Charet gaue attendance Iames kyng of Scottes the principal
morner, the duke of Exceter Thomas his vncle, therle of Warwike
Richard, therle of Marche Edmond, therle of Stafford Humfrey, the
earle of Mortaine Edmonde Beausford, the lord Fitzhugh Henry, the
lord Hungerford Water, sir Lewes Robsert Burchier, sir Ihon Cornewale
lord Fāhope, and the lord Crumwel wer the other morners. The
lord Louel, the lord Audeley, the lord Morley, the lord Souche bare the
baners of saintes and the Baron of Dudley bare the standerd &amp; therle
of Longuile bare the baner. The Hachementes wer borne onely by capitaines to the nōbre of .xii. and roūd about the charet rode .CCCCC.
mē of armes al in blacke harnes &amp; their horses barded blacke with the
but of their speres vpward. The cōduit &amp; ordre of al this dolorous dole
was cōmaūded to sir Williā Philip treasorer of the kynges houshold
and to sir Wylliā Porter his chief caruer and other, Beside this, on euery
syde of the charet went .CCC. persons holdyng long torches, and
lordes bearyng baners, banerols &amp; penons. With this funeral pompe
he was conueighed from Boys de Uyncens to Paris and so to Roan,
to Abbeuile, to Caleys, to Douer and so thorough London to Westminster,
where he was buried with suche solempne ceremonies, suche

mournyng of lordes, suche praier of priestes, suche lamentyng of commons
as neuer was before that day sene in the realme of Englande.
Shortly after this solempnitie, his sorowful quene returned into England
and kept her estate with the yong kyng her sōne. Thus ended
this noble and puissant prince his most noble &amp; fortunate reigne
ouer the realme of England: whose life although cruel Atropos
before his tyme abbreuiated, yet neither fyre, rust, nor
frettyng tynne shal amongest Englishmen ether appall
his honoure or obliterate his glorye whiche in so
fewe yeres and brief daies achiued so high
aduentures and made so great a
conquest.

riche and slaieth poore, vnbodiyng
the solle of this godly prince
this marcial capitain and renoumed
flower, not onely dismaied and appalled
the hertes and corages of the Englishe
nacion, but also pufte vp and
encoraged the myndes and stomackes
of the Dolphyn and his proude people: The one parte thynkyng,
the kepyng of Normandy and other dominions to hym gayned to bee
very dangerus, The other part trustyng the farther cōquest in Fraūce
not onely to the doubtfull, but to their iudgementes apparantly impossible:
Yet the politike Princes and sage Magestrates of the realme of
England well remembryng thynges that wer passed, and sagely ponderyng
the tyme present, but moste of all prudently forscyng chaunces
iminent and perels at hand, to thentent to set the membres of the body
stedfast vnder the hedde, Whiche as shepe without a sheperd far from
the folde might wandre and straie at large, caused yong prince Henry,
the sole orphane of his noble parent kyng Henry the fifth, beyng of the
age of .ix. monethes or there about with the sound of trumpettes openly
to be proclaimed kyng of Englande and of Fraunce the .xxx. daie of
August, in the yere of our lorde .M.ccc.xxii. by the name of kyng Hēry
the sixt, to the great reioysyng and comfort of all the Englishe nacion.
            
               AND the custody of this young prince was apoyncted to Thomas
duke of Excester, and to Henry Beaufford bishopp of Wynchester: the
duke of Bedford was deputed to be Regent of Fraunce, and the duke
of Gloucester was assigned Protector of Englande. Whiche takyng
vpon hym that office, least paraduenture he might herafter repent his
actes and doynges, as a man remembryng other and forgettyng hymself,
called to hym wise and graue counsailers, by whose aduise he prouided
and ordeined for all thynges whiche ether redounded to the honor
of the realme, or semed profitable to the publique welth of thesame
And when he had set in an ordre al matters concernyng the inward affaires
of the realme of Englande, he prouided farther all thynges necessary
and conuenient for warre and farther conquest in Fraunce, and
appoyncted valiant &amp; expert capitaines whiche should be ready when
oportunitie of tyme required, Beside this, he gathered greate somes of

money to maintein the men of warre, and left nothyng forgotten that
might let or hynder his purposed enterprise.
            
               VVHILE these thynges were thus deuised within the realme of
Englande, the duke of Bedforde Regent of Fraunce, no lesse studied
then toke payne, not onely to kepe and ordre the countrees and regions
by kyng Henry late cōquered and gained, but also determined not
to leue of from daily warre and continuall trauaile till the tyme that
Charles the Dolphyn (whiche was now a flote, because kyng Charles
his father in the moneth of Octobre this present yere, was departed to
God,) wer ether subdued or brought to dewe obeysance. And surely the
deth of this kyng Charles caused many alteracions &amp; chaunges in the
realme of Fraunce, for a greate parte of the nobilitee whiche ether for
feare of the puissance of the Englishemen, or for to please and folowe
the mynde and appetite of Charles the Frenche kyng, toke parte with
kyng Henry against the Dolphyn: Heryng now of the French kynges
death, returned from the English part and adioyned themselfes to the
compainie of the Dolphyn, and diligently studied howe to vanquishe
and dryue awaie the Englishe nacion out of the territory of Fraunce.
            
               THE Duke of Bedford beeyng greatly moued with these sodaine
chaunges, fortified his tounes bothe with Garrisons and municions,
and assembled together a great armie bothe of Englishmen and Normans,
to whom he made a long oracion, admonishyng them to obserue
and kepe their othe &amp; faith (whiche thei had made to the late kyng Henry
and his heires) inuiolate and vnbroken, willyng them in no wise to
be the occasioners or counsailers that young kyng Henry should be depriued
from his fathers lawfull inheritance, by the hatred of certayne
traitors Frenchemen whiche had renewed the old hatred beyng of late
extinct betwene the realmes of Englande and of Fraunce, and studied
to set al thynges again in a broyle: requiryng them also to call to their
memory how that the realmes of Englande and of Fraunce, the twoo
moste famous regiōs of all Europe, by the benifite of almightie God,
wer of late so vnited connexed &amp; ioyned together in an eternall league
and composicion, and so strōgly established that no worldly power wer
able or of puissaunce sufficient, to resist or withstande the malice of the
same: And although some tymes by chaunce of warre the losse mighte
turne on their part, yet in conclusion the detriment should be recouered
and a surplusage gayned. And if (accordyng to their bounden duties)
thei would honor serue and loue young kyng Henry their soueraigne
lorde, and would diligently persecute &amp; set on his enemies, thei should
not onely shewe thēselfes true and faithfull subiectes to their true and
vndoubted kyng: But also should for their fidelitie and good seruice
receiue of hym condigne rewardes, ouer and beside immortall fame
and renoune.
            
               THIS exhortacion staied the hertes of many of the Frenche capitaines,
whiche willyngly sware to Kyng Henry feaultie and obedience

by whose example the comonaltie did thesame. Thus all the people set
in an ordre in the realme of Fraunce, nothyng was mynded but warre
and nothyng was spoken of but of conquest. The Dolphyn whiche lay
at this tyme in the citee of Poytiers heryng of the death of his parente
had his herte mixed bothe with ioye and sorowe: for notwithstandyng
that he was sorowfull as a naturall child whiche lamented the death of
his father, yet he was ioyous that power &amp; princely estate was now to
hym happened by the whiche he iudged that he should be the more able
to defend his enemies and recouer more frendes: &amp; so callyng together
the Princes of his faccion, caused hymself to bee proclaimed Kyng of
Fraūce by the name of Charles the .vij. And thē beyng in good hope of
recoueryng his patrimony &amp; expellyng his enmies, with a haut corage
prepared war &amp; assembled together a great armie, and first the war began
by light skirmishes, but after it proceded into main battailes.
            
               THE Dolphyn thynkyng not to make long delayes in so greate a
cause, lest the power of his enemies might daily be augmented, sent the
lorde Grauile to the toune of Pount Melance stādyng on the riuer of
Seyne, whiche so sodainly came to thesame that he was on the walles
or the souldiors within heard of his approche, and so he toke the toune
and slewe a greate nombre of the Englishe souldiors. When the Regēt
of Fraunce was aduertised of this sodain enterprise, he apoyncted the
Lorde Thomas Montacute erle of Salisbury, a manne bothe for his
greate pollicie and haute corage more to be compared to the old valiant
Romans then to men of his daies, accompaignied with the erle of
Suffolke, the lorde Scales, the yong lorde Pounynges, sir Ihon Fastolffe
master of the houshold with thesaid lorde Regent, and diuerse other
to besige the toune of Pont Melance, whiche after two monethes
was rendered to thesaid erle, and the lorde of Grauile sware to be trew
to the Kyng of Englande euer after that daie, but shortly after he forgettyng
his othe returned to his old master again. The erle of Salisbury
apoynted sir Henry Mortimer and sir Richard Uernon to be capitaines
of that toune. And from thence departed into Champaignie
and ther besieged the toune of Sens and toke sir Guillam Maryn the
capitain and slewe all the souldiors within the toune, and made there
capitaines sir Hugh Geddyng and sir Richard awbemond.
            
               THE Parisians whiche euer like the Wethercocke be variable and
inconstaunt, perceiuyng that the Dolphyn daily began to haue more
aide and power then he was before accustomed, trustyng to returne again
vnder his obeysance and subiecciō (whiche thei bothe wished and
desired) to the intente that it should not apere to come of their desire
and that their faith and fidelite should not be put in the balance of diffidence
with the Englishe nacion, sent diuerse Senators of their citee
as Ambassadors to the kyng of Englād, desiryng hym of aide and succor,
to whom not onely greate thankes were rendered for dooyng their
dutie of subiecciō, but also high feastes wer made, and promises declared

that if thei stil continued in due obeysance, and wer not adherent to
the kynges enemies, yt neither succour should want, nor cost should be
spared for their comen cōfort and publike vtilite. With whiche answer
the cōpaigny outwardly pleased (whatsoeuer thei inwardly imagined)
departed to Paris. In this season Humfrey duke of Gloucester either
blynded with ambicion or dotyng for loue, maried the lady Iaquet or
Iacomin doughter and sole heire to William of Bauier duke of Holland,
whiche was lawfull wife to Ihon duke of Brabant then liuyng.
whiche mariage was not onely woundered at of the comon people, but
also detested of the nobilite, &amp; abhorred of the Clergie. But suerly the
swete tast, of this pleasant mariage, brought after a sower sauce, bothe
to the amorus housbande, and to the wanton wife. For Ihon duke of
Brabant, what with force, and what with spirituall compulsaries, neuer
left of, till he had recouered his Lady out of the Duke of Gloucesters
possession, as after you shall here.

                  THese chaūces thus happenyng as you haue heard, Ihon
duke of Bedford, Philip duke of Burgoyn, &amp; Ihon duke
of Britayn, made an assemble &amp; frendly enteruiewe in the
citee of Amias, where thei renewed the olde league and
auncient amitie made betwene the noble prince kyng Hē

and agrementes, eche of them to be to other bothe frend and aider, and
the enemy of the one to bee enemy to the other, and all thei to bee bothe
frendes and aiders to the kyng of Englande, and well willyng to his
wel willers, and auengers of his aduersaries. And because that affinitie
is an embracer of amitie, there was concluded a mariage betwene
the duke of Bedford, and the lady Anne sister to the duke of Burgoyn.
When these agrementes wer finished, the Regent departed to Troys
in Chāpain, whether with high pompe was conueighed the lady Anne
of Burgoyn, whiche in the presence of her brother and her Uncle duke
of Brabant, and of therles of Salisbury and Suffolke, and of .ix.C.
Lordes knightes and esquires, she was maried to Ihon duke of Bedford
with suche solempnitie, feste and triūphe, as before that tyme had
not been seen of the Burgonions.
               
                  DVRYNG this triumphe, the Parisiās thinkyng to blind the iyes
of the duke of Bedford wrote to hym, how diuerse Castles &amp; fortresses
liyng rounde about their territory, wer replenished with his enemies,
daily stoppyng their passages, and robbyng their marchantes, to their
vtter vndoyng, if thei by his helpe wer not relieued: fraudulently meanyng,
and falsely entisyng hym to absent hymself from theim, till their
craftie conueighed purpose wer compassed and achiued. For diuerse of
them stubbernly beryng the yoke and subieccion of the English nacion
perceiuyng the duke of Bedforde and the principall capitaines of the

Englishmen to be farre from Paris, emploiyng themselfes to ioy and
solace for the honor of this high mariage, conspired to bryng into the
citee Charles the Dolphyn callyng hymself Frenche kyng, duryng the
tyme of his absence. And to thentent that their inuēted purpose should
succede, thei therof aduertised the Dolphyn and his counsaill appoyntyng
the daie of his comyng and the post of his entre. But no treason
is commonly hiden nor no sedicion long vnreueled, for Pies will chatter
and Mice will pepe, but by whom I cannot declare: The Regente
was informed of all the secrete confederacy and sedicious facciō, wherfore
he meanyng not to lose in short tyme, that whiche in no smal space
was gayned, put spurres to the horsse, and with a greate power entred
into Paris one daie before the faire was apoinced, and two nightes before
the lokyng for of his enemies, whō beyng vnprouided he sodainly
caused to be apprehended and taken, and openly put to execucion. After
this ieoperdy thus escaped, he putte diffidence in all the Parisians
trustyng litle the nobles and geuyng lesse credite to the comons, determined
to fortifie the Garrisons of his owne nacion and all the Castles
nere and adioynyng to the citee, whiche within small tyme were habundauntly
furnished. And to auoyde all nighte watchers adioynyng
to Paris and the confines of thesame, he first toke into his possession
ether by assaute or composicion the toune of Traynel and Bray
vpon Seyne, and because two Castles the one called Pacy and the other
called Cursay were also euill neighbors to the Parisians, he sente
sir Ihon Fastolffe great Master of his houshold, with a notable army
to besiege the Castle of Pacy, whiche takyng vpon hym that enterprise
so handled his enemies that the capitain named Guyllam Reymon esquire
&amp; all the garrison yelded them symply to his mercy and discreciō
whom he sent as prisoners to the citee of Paris, and after besieged the
Castle of Coursay whiche to hym was shortly rendered vpon like appoyntmēt,
and so with praie and prisoners he returned to the lorde Regent
his master. In this very season the Dolphyn sent lorde Willyam
Stuard Constable of Scotland, and therle of Uentadore in Auergne
and many other nobles of his part to laie siege to the toune of Crauāt
in the coūtie of Auxerre within the partes of Burgoyn, wherof heryng
the lorde Regent and the duke of Burgoyn thei assembled a greate armie,

gaue great laudes and thankes to almightie God and after entered
into the toune of Crauant muche praisyng the doynges of the capitaines
and the fidelitie of the citezens, and when they had set all thynges
in an ordre they returned to Paris where of the regent they were ioyously
receiued, whiche there constituted therle of Salsbury (as he was

layde siege to the toune &amp; castle of Moūtaguillon in Bry, wherof were

erle of Suffolke toke by force the castle of Coucy: and the strong castle
de la roche he gat by appointment in Mosconoys.
               
                  NOVVE muste I go backe to put you in memorye howe Iames
kyng of Scottes beyng bothe prisoner in the tyme of kyng Henry the
fourth and also as subiect to kyng Henry the fift his sōne, seruyng him
in his warres in Fraunce tyl he departed out of this transsitory life at
Boys de Uyncens and so as chief morner attended on the corps of the
sayd deceassed vnto his burial, and after at Westminster wasreleased
of his captiuitie and restored to his realme and possession. For the true
knowledge therof you shal vnderstande that Englande demaunded a
smal raunsome for so great a prince as the Scottes accompte their
kyng (and the Scottes were neither able nor offered no summe conuenient)
wherfore the coūsel of the realme of England grauously pondered
and wisely considered that if by coniunction of mariage, England
and Scotland were perfectly knit in one, that the indissoluble band of
amitie betwene the Frenche and Scottishe nacions should be shortly
broken and dissolued. Wherfore the protector of the realme of Englād
by the consent of the whole baronage of the same gaue to him in mariage
the Lady Iane doughter to Ihon earle of Sommerset desceased,
not onely sister to Ihon then duke of Sommerset but also cosyn germayne
remoued to the kyng and nece to the cardinal of Wynchester
and the duke of Exceter.
               
                  THE kyng of Scottes hauyng great affection to this fayre Lady,
but muche more desiryng his deliuerance and libertie, put in hostages
for the residue of his raunsome because a great part therof was deminished

and abated for the money allowed to hym for his mariage, &amp; so
was deliuered to depart at his pleasure. Alacke, the old prouerbes bee
to true: an Ape although she bee clothed in purple, will be but an Ape,
and a Scotte neuer so gentely enterteined of an Englishe prince will
be but a dissimulyng Scotte. What kyndnes could be more shewed to
a prisoner then to bryng hym vp in good litterature? What loue maie
bee more declared to a captiue, then to instructe hym in marciall feates
and warlike affaires? What fauor can be more ascribed to a high and
renoumed prince, then to geue in mariage to his vnderlyng and vassall
his cosyn and kinswoman of his royal parentage lawfully discended.
All these kyndnesses suffised not, nor all these gratuities auailed
not to make this kyng Iames frendly to the realme of Englande. For
he notwithstandyng his homage doen to the young Henry kyng of Englande
and of Fraunce at his Castle of Wynsore this present yere, before
three Dukes, twoo Archebishoppes, xii. erles .x. bishoppes .xx. barons,
and twoo hundred knightes and esquires and mo, accordyng to
the tenor here after foloyng.
               
                  I Iames Stuart Kyng of Scottes, shalbe true and faithfull vnto
you lorde Henry by the grace of God kyng of Englande and Fraunce
the noble and superior lorde of the kyngdome of Scotlande, and vnto
you I make my fidelitie for thesame kyngdome of Scotlande, whiche
I hold and claime to hold of you, and I shall beare you my faithe and
fidelitie of life and lymme and worldly honor against al men, and faithfully
I shall knowledge and shall do to you seruice due of the kyngdō
of Scotland aforesaid. So God help me and these holy Euangelistes
               
               
                  NETHER regardyng his othe, nor estemyng the great abundance
of plate and riche Clothes of Arras, to hym by the mother and vncles
of his wife liberally geuen and frendly deliuered (of whiche sorte of riches
fewe or none before that daie wer euer seen in the coūtrey of Scotlande)
like a dogge whiche hath cast vp his stomacke and returneth to
his vomet, or like a snake whiche after his engenderyng with a Lampray
taketh again his old poyson: After he had once taken the ayre and
smelled the sent of the Scottishe soyle became like his falce fraudulēt
forfathers, an vntrue prince and like his proude pratyng progenitors
toke the ymage of a braggyng and bostyng Scot, newly alied hymself
with the Frenche nacion. And yet what soeuer he did, his nacion bothe
write and testifie, that by the learnyng whiche he by the greate benifite
of the kynges of Englande duryng his captiuitee in this realme had
obteigned, replenished his countrey with good litterature, and by the
nurture the whiche he was brought vp in Englād, he brought his people
to ciuilitee: So that his captiuitee was to his nacion the greatest
libertie that euer thei could haue, deliueryng them from blynde ignorance
to Angelicke knowledge, reducyng theim from bestiall maners
to honest behauor, and in conclusion causyng theim to knowe vertue
from vice, pollicie from rudenes, and humain honestie from sauage liuyng.

This was the deliuerance and the doynges of Iames the fyrst
of that name kyng of Scottes, whiche neither reigned verye quietly,
nor yet euer fauored Englishemen before the Frenche people: sauyng
that he hauyng with him into his countrey a yong gentleman of Northumberland
called Andrew Gray (whiche duryng his captiuitie was
his companion) promoted him to the mariage of the heyre of the lorde
of Foules in Anguis, of the whiche the lord Gray of Scotland at this
day do descend.

                  NOw leue I the doynges of Scotland, and returne to the
affaires of England. The duke of Gloucester beyng protector
and gouernor of the realme, cōsideryng that wood
must be ministred to kepe fyre, and men ought to be sēt to
set forwarde war, called to him the pieres and nobilitie of
the realme, and by their agrementes &amp; deuises, sent into Fraūce to the
regent his brother .x.M. men of warre, whiche were of the same regent
in the coūtrey of Paris louyngly receiued, &amp; according to their degres
honestly entertained. Duryng their liyng in Paris, diuers chaunces
happened in Fraunce, for euen as Englishmen valiantly wonne, and
victoriously cōquered tounes and castles with open warre and apparant
conquest: so the Frenchmen fraudulently stale &amp; couertely obtained
diuers fortresses and holdes appertainyng to thenglish faccion, &amp;
in especial the fayre toune of Compaigne, &amp; the prety toune of Crotoy.
               
                  VVHEN the duke of Bedford was aduertised of these craftye trickes
and sodaine inuented trames, he sent furth an army, fyrst to Compaigne,
wherof was capitaine the erle of Suffolke accompanied with
therle of Liguy, &amp; diuers other capitaines of the Englishmen, whiche
lay on the one side of the riuer of Sohame, &amp; on the other side laye the
lord Lisle Adain, sir Thomas Raupstone, &amp; the prouost of Paris. The
Frechmen beyng strongly furnished and wel vitailed, coragiously defended
the toune against the assailātes. The Englishmen perceiuyng
that Guylliā Remond otherwise called Mariolayn, had bene the leder
of the souldiers within the toune, whiche before at Pacy was takē prisoner
by sir Ihon Fastolf, caused him to be sent for to Paris, and so
brought him to the seige, and set him in a chariot with a halter aboute
his necke, and cōueighed him to the gibbet without the toune, sending
worde to the garison within the toune, that if they would not without
delay rēdre the toune &amp; fortresse, thei would incōtinent strāgle their old
capitaine and chief conductor. The souldiors within the toune perceiuyng
that if Guylliā Raymond the onely trust of their relefe, and the
aūcient frend in their necessitie, shuld suffre death, that then their hope
of al ayde were extinguished, &amp; the sure nutriment of their liuyng was
from them secluded: for the deliuerance of him and sauegarde of themselues,
yelded the toune: so that both he &amp; they might depart with horse

and harnes onely, in sure conduite and safetye: yet long or the toune of
Compaigne was deliuered, sir Philip Hal whiche was sent to Crotoy
by the lorde regent with .viii.C. men to besiege the toune, gat it by assault
sodainly, or the Frenchmen had either desposed their garrison, or
appointed their lodgynges and toke al the men of warre and put them
to raunsome. And so these .ii. tounes cowardly stollen, were manfully
recouered, but yet the writers of Frenche fables to deface the glorye
of the Englishmen, write and say that these tounes were yelded to the
Burgonyons, whiche neither had the kepyng of them nor were souldiers
to any other person but to the kyng of England. While these thinges
were thus doyng in Fraunce, sir Ihon de la Pole brother to therle
of Suffolke capitaine of Auranches in Normandy, assembled all the
garrisons of the base Marches of the coūtrey of Aniow, &amp; came before
the cytie of Angiers and brent the subbarbes, spoyled and destroyed
the whole countrey, and hauyng as many prayes and prisoners as his
men might cary, he was encountred by the earle of Aubemerle, the vicount
Narbone and .vi. thousand Frenchmen: whiche findyng the Englishmen
out of arraye because of the cariage of their great spoyle, sodainly
set on thē and slewe .CCC. persons and toke prisoners the sayd
sir Ihon Delapole, sir Ihon Basset, Ihon Auford leuetenaunt of Faloys,
Ihon Clyfton, Henry Mortymer and .vi.C. other. Although the
Frenchmen gat this day in one place, yet thei wēt not victorious away
in another, for the bastard de la Baulme and the lorde Craignar capitaines
of Courrallon with a great band, made a roade into Masconnoys,
with whom by chance met Mathew Gough and other Englishemen
whiche were scouryng the countrey to se and heare newes of their
enemies, there was a sore conflict and an hard encountre, the partes in
maner beyng of corage &amp; nombre egal, but after long fight, the French
men almost al wer slaine &amp; taken, and the bastard beyng wel horsed fled
after whom folowed with the fiersnes of his spurres Mathew Gough
and chased him to his castle gate and there toke him as he would haue
hid him in the diche &amp; presēted him to the earle of Salsbury, returnyng
from Compaigne to Paris, whiche not onely gaue to him the rightes
belōging to the prisoner, but also rewarded him with a goodly courser
and highly exalted his name and manhode.
               
                  ABOVTE this season, Arthur brother to Ihon duke of Britaine
cōmonly called the earle of Richemond, hauyng neither profite of the
name nor of the countrey, notwithstādyng that king Henry the .v. had
created him carle of Yury in Normandy &amp; gaue him not onely a great
pencion but thesame toune of Yury: yet because his brother the duke of
Brytaine fearyng the Englishmen nowe hauyng Normandye would
smel and desire to tast the swete soyle of Britaine, was late (contrary to
his leage and othe) returned to the part of Charles the dolphyn, he like
wise returned and craftly without cause fled into Flaunders &amp; so came
to the dolphyn to Poytiers, whiche was more glad of his cōmyng then

if he had gained a C.M. crounes, for the Britons which kept the toune
and castle of Yury hearyng that their master was ioyned with the dolphyn
bothe kepte the castle against the duke of Bedford, furnishyng it
dayly with new people &amp; municons, and also infested, spoyled and robbed
the countrey adioynyng, doyng to the Englishmen the most hurt &amp;
damage that either could be deuised or imagined.
               
                  THE lord Regent beyng aduertised of all these troubles &amp; calamities,
assēbled a great army both of Englishmen and Normans, entendyng
to serche the dolphin in euery part, to thētent to geue him battail
in a pitched feld and so to make a final ende of his entended conquest.
So hauyng in his companye therle of Salsbury, therle of Suffolke,
the lord Scales, the lord Wylloughby, the lord pounyng, sir Reynold
Gray, sir Ihon Fastolf, sir Ihon Saluayne, Lanslot Lisle, sir Philip
Halle, sir Ihon Pashely, sir Ihon Gray, sir Thomas Blunt, sir Robert
Harlyng, sir William Oldhal and many other valiant knightes
and esquiers to the nombre (as the Frenche writers testifie) of xviii.C.
men of armes and .viii.M. archers and other, came before the toune of
Yury whiche was wel defended: but the Englishemen began to vndermine
the walles, so that they within were glad to rendre the toune vpō
condicion, whiche was taken. Howbeit the capitaines of the castle promised
to yeld if their fortresse wer not rescued at a day assigned by the
dolphyn with a nomber sufficiēt to raise the siege, &amp; vpon this promise
hostages wer deliuered into the possession of the lord regent. By his licence
an herault was sent to the dolphyn to aduertise him of the tyme
determined, the whiche hearyng of the destresse that his people &amp; 
                     •

and therle Boughan, whom then in hope of good spede he made
Constable of Fraunce (whiche office he enioyed not fully an hundreth

                  THIS army royal approched within .ii. miles of Yury and sent .xl.
light horsmen to view and espy both the nomber and cōduit of the Englishmen.
These spyes came very nere to the siege and wer espied and
chased to their cōpanions againe, and declared all what they had seen
and perceiued. The duke of Alanson seyng that he could not gette any
auantage of the Englishemen (although the Dolphyn had geuen hym
in straight cōmaundement to fight with the regent) whether his heart
fayled or he thought to wayte a more fortunate season for his purpose
and enterprise, retired backe with his whole army to the toune of Uernoyle
in Perche whiche belonged to the kyng of England, &amp; sent word

to the garison of that toune that they had discōfited &amp; slaine al the Englishe
army and that the regent with a small nōber by swyftnes of his
horse had saued him selfe. The inhabitantes of Uernoyle geuyng to
light credit to the Frenche fablers, receiued the duke of Alāson with al
his army into the toune &amp; submitted thē selues to him. Whiche toune
he desyred to haue of the gift of the dolphyn as his owne inheritance &amp;
lawful patrimony. Now approched the day of rescous of Yury, which
was the day of our Lady the Assumpcion, at which day no rescous appeared
to sir Gerrard de la Pallier captain of the castle, whiche beyng
in dispayre of all ayde and comforte, presented the keys to the duke of
Bedford &amp; shewed him a letter signed &amp; sealed with the hādes of .xviii.
great lordesh whiche the day before promised to geue the duke battaile
and to desolue the siege and raise the assault: Well sayd the duke, if
their heartes would haue serued, their puissaunce was sufficient ones
to haue profered or to haue performed this faithful promise. But syth
they disdaine to seke me, God and saint George willyng I shal not desist
to folowe the tractes of their horses tyl one part of vs be by battail
ouerthrowen: and so he gaue a safeconduyte to the capitaine and other
which wold depart, but many of the Britons within the castle of Yury
seyng the faint heartes and the false promises of the flatteryng Frenchmen
submitted them selues to the lorde regent and sware to be true to
the kyng and him, whom he gentely accepted and put them in wages.
Then he furnished the castle and toune with a newe garrison, and incō
                  tinent
he sent the earle of Suffolke with .vi.C. horses to espy wher the
Frenchemen were lodged, whiche passed by Dampeuile, and came to
Bretnel wher he heard newes that the Frenchmen had taken Uernoile
in Perche &amp; were there yet abidyng, wherof with al diligent celerite he
sent worde to the duke of Bedford, which not mindyng to lese his long
desired pray set forward in great hast toward his enemies. The Frēchmen
hearyng of his cōmyng set their people in array and made all one
maine battile without forward or rereward, &amp; appointed certaine Lū
                  bardes
and horsmen to breake the array of the Englishemen either behynd
or at the sides, wherof was capitaine sir Stephyn Uenoyles called
the hire. The duke of Bedford not ignoraunt howe to ordre his
men, made likewise one entier battaile &amp; suffered no man to be on horse
backe, and set the archers (euery one hauyng a sharpe stake) both in the
front of the battaile and on the sydes like wynges, and behynd the battaile
were the pages with the chariottes and cariages, and all the horses
were tyed together either with the reines of their bridles or by the
tayles, to thentent that their enemies should not sodainely surprise or
disturbe them on the backe behynd: and for to defend the cariages wer
appointed two thousand archers. The Frenchmen at the fyrst light remembryng
how often tymes in piched feldes they had bene ouercome
and vanquished of the Englishe nacion, began somewhat to feare, but
when they sawe no remedy but to fight, they toke good courage to thē
                  
and set softely forwarde. In whiche marchyng the Duke of Alaunson,
sittyng on horsebacke saied to his capitaines.

                     OVYNG compainions,O
                        •
                     acion of the duke of Alaunson. and hardy souldiers, call to your remembraunce,
how the Englishemen haue not onely gotten from vs the noble
isle of Fraunce, the duchies of Normandy and Aniow, but also sith
their enterprise and conquest hath bothe slain our parentes and killed
our frendes, yea, and hath driuen our naturall Prince, and very soueraigne
Lorde from his chief habitacion and surest chaumber, the faire
citee of Paris: whiche act neuer Pagan durst attēpt or euer any prince
was able to acheue. Besides this, you se that the duke of Bedford Regent
here for the kyng of Englande, entendyng nothyng more then the
deposicion or the destruccion of our kyng and his nobilitie, and in finall
cōclusion to bryng to extreme bondage all vs, our wiues and children,
and al the people of this so long renoumed region, by many hundred
yeres called the realme of Fraunce, whiche is as muche to saie, as
a fre countrey, or a franke lande. Alas, shall your kyng now be made a
subiecte, shall your peres and nobilitee bee made vassals, and you also
slaues &amp; bondmen to a forrain nacion? Where is the liberty of Fraūce
and where is the auncient fredome? When you defended your fraunchises,
and when your hartes serued you: your Kyng ruled kynges,
your princis possessed the empire, and your nacion subdued Germany,
conquered Italy, and ouercame the proude Spanyardes. Shall wee
now, fallyng out of kynd from our fathers, feare the puissaunce of the
arrogant Englishemen, beyng men of no forecast, nor of no excellente
wit, long in gettyng and shortly lesyng? Will you now suffre the olde
glory of Fraunce to be put in obliuion? will you haue an Englishe infant,
whiche liueth with pappe to bee your kyng and gouernor? Will
you liue in seruitude of a barbarous nacion, in whom is neither bountifulnes
nor honor? Clerckes saie, that the greatest plague, that euer
God scourged with the Israelites, was, when he permitted them to bee
caried from their natiue countrey to the bondage of Babilon, where
thei liued in captiuitie by the space of many yeres. What can bee a
more greater scourge, then to haue a forrein ruler in a free region?
What dishonor can there be more to a countrey, then to haue the nobilitie
put backe from rule, and to be gouerned by strangers. Beleue me
beleue me, it is to vs all one blot, to bee a slaue in Turkeye, vnder the
Turkishe bondage, and to be a free man in Fraūce vnder the Englishe
libertie. Of this poynt you be sure: if thei gain this battaill, thei be not
vnlike to obtain the whole region: whiche if thei get, then is the enheritaunce
theirs: then be all the riches theirs, and then all the people bee
their subiectes. If thei bee rulers, fare well the franke and Frenche libertie:
If thei be lordes, welcome Englishe seruitude. So that now we
stande al on this poynt, either to be free or bondmen. Whiche terme of
bondage is so detested of all nacions, that there can be no more reproch
to a man then to call hym a villain or a bondman. Therfore manly defence

must onely withstand this mischief, and hartie corage must driue
backe this imminēt plage. This is the daie either of our deliueraunce
out of vile seruitude, or the daie of our entry into the vale of bondage.
The conclusion of this battaill is very doubtfull, for if we bee vanquished,
the gain for our side is almoste without recouery, cōsidryng, that
here be the best men, &amp; wisest capitaines vnder our kyng: And if we get
the vpper hande, our heddes shalbe free and out of the Englishe yoke.
And although the duke of Bedforde hath here with hym, all the power
that he can gather on this side the sea, yet I assure you, (God willyng)
I will not turne one fote backeward for feare of hym, or his picked armie.
Therefore I exhorte you to remembre, your wifes, your children
and your selfes. Fight manfully and sticke eche to other for the libertie
of our countrey: I doubt not but the victory shalbee ours, and the honor
shalbe our kynges. For if this daie we vanquishe hym and sparcle
his armie, we shall so diligently folowe Fortunes good grace, that not
onely Fraunce to vs shall yeld, and Normandy bowe, but we shall recouer
again al our citees and tounes, whiche out of our possession wer
gained, before any aide can come to rescue out of the poore isle of Englande.
Now consideryng, that we hang in the ballaunce betwene honor
and shame, libertie and bondage, gaine or losse, let euery man take
harte and corage to hym, litle regardyng, or caryng, either for death, or
the force of his enemies, and with a manly countenaunce marche furth
toward our foes.
               
                  THE Englishemen perceiuyng their greate nombre, and knowyng
that the chief strength consisted in the Scottes, began somwhat to stay
and consult, what was moste expedient to bee doen. The duke of Bedford
sittyng on a baye courser in the middes of the battaill vnder a bā
                  ner
euriously beten with his Armes, not content with their whisperynges
and protractyng of tyme, saied vnto theim with an audible voyce.
               
                  YOV valiaunt capitaines and hardie souldiers,The orarion of the Duke of Bedforde. my louyng compaynins
in armes, and frendly felowes. If you cōsidre with your self
what daie this is: What honor and what profite wee shall get by our
trauaile and pain, I doubt not but where you now stand stil musyng,
you would runne furth a galloppe, and where you runne on your fete,
you would, if you had winges, flie as faste, as euer did Hauke to his
praie. For greate is the honor that is gotten with paine, and swete is
the lucre, that is gayned with trauaile, for you muste remembre, that
nothyng is wel doen, if it growe not to a good conclusion: and thyng
were as good neuer to be begon, as neuer ended. My brother our late
soueraigne lord, (whose soule God pardon) hath entred into this countrey,
as into his awne lawfull inheritaunce: and first conquered Normandy,
and after by agremēt of kyng Charles the vsurper, he was by
assent of the nobilitee, agrement of the Clergie, &amp; speciall request of the
commonaltie, restored to his rightfull inheritaunce, and lawful patritrimony,
whiche by his death is returned and come to my nephewe our

moste redoubted souereigne. The beginnyng of this conquest was
good, and the sequele better, yet resteth the finall knot to be knitte, and
the last locke to be shut vp. For if we suffre Charles the dolphyn, whiche
now vsurpeth the name, and estate royall of this realme of Fraūce,
to proceade farther in his purpose, or to gather more puyssaunce, or allure
more people, I cannot tell then what feates flattryng fortune will
worke: and of this I am sure, that if we suffre his fier still to flame, as
it hath begon, we shall haue skant water to quenche out thesame. Here
he hath assembled all the Frenche men that he can get, and for lacke of
aide, he hath retained the Scottes: croppe hym now at the beginnyng
and he shall growe no more: let hym grow farther and he will passe our
reache: distomfite hym now and bryng our conquest to a conclusion: let
hym alone now, and we shalbe new to begin. Therfore I say, it is wisedome
to take occasion, when the hery side and not the balde side is profered.
If wee feare the multitude, remembre our awne victories,
whiche we haue euer obteined by lesse nombre, and not by the greater.
If we feare death, remembre the glory and immortall fame, that shall
succeade of our valiaunt actes, if we sell our lifes so dere. If we shalbe
slain, considre I haue a kyng to my nephew, and a duke to my brother,
and twoo noble vncles, and you haue frendes, kynsemen and children,
whiche wil reuēge our death, to the vttermost poynt: therfore I saie let
euery man this day do his best. For this is the daie of thed of our great
trauaile, the daie of our greate victory, and the daie of our euerlastyng
fame: Therfore good felowes, put your onely trust in God, call to hym
for aide boldly, and marche forward hardly, for our enemies be at hād.
               
                  HE had skace ended his exhortacion, but the Englishmen beyng incouraged
with his prudent persuasion, sette on their enemies, criyng,
Sainct George, Bedford. And the Frenchemen likewise cried, Moūtioye,
sainct Denise. Then the arrowes flewe out of the long bowes on
the one parte, the quarrelles out of the crosse bowes on the other parte.
After thei came to hande strokes: greate was the fight, &amp; terrible was
the battaill, with so indifferent iudgement of victory, that no heraulde
could determyne to whiche parte Fortune moste shewed her louyng
countenaunce. For on bothe sides men wer slain and wounded, and on
bothe partes some wer felled and recouered, thus stil in a doubtful iudgement,
the battaill continued aboute three houres. The duke of Alaū
                  son
in the meane season neuer ceased to exhorte and praie his people
manly to fight, and not to suffre their enemies, (whiche wer at the very
point to be ouercome) by their faint hartes to be victors, and ouercommers.
Likewise the duke of Bedford rode about his armie, refreshyng
the weake with freshe men, and encoragyng his people with moste plesaunt
wordes: But at the last, when he perceiued the Frenchmen, what
with heate, and with trauaill, to waxe wery and faint, and not to bee so
freshe as thei wer before (for surely the nature of the Frenchmen, is not
to labor long in fightyng, and muche more braggeth then fighteth) he

with al his strength set incontinent on them with suche a violence, that
thei bare theim doune to the ground by fine force. The Frenche horsemē
that daie did litle seruice: for the archers so galled their horses, that
thei desired not muche to approche their presence. This battaill was
fought the .xxvij. daie of August, in the yere of our Lorde .M.CCCC.xxv.
in the whiche battaill wer slain.

                  AFTER that the Duke of Bedforde had thus obteined the vpper
hand of his enemies, and discomfited the onely strength of the dolphin
he vpon his knees rendred to almightie God his hartie thankes, not
without effusion of teares. Then he commaunded all the Frenchemen
within the toune of Uernoile, to go out and depart, or els to abide their
aduēture. Thei perceiuyng the euil successe of their bostyng enterprise,
and seyng no meane, wherby in so lowe an ebbe, thei might bee ayded,
deliuered vp the toune, and went furthe out of thesame, their lifes saued.
Of whiche toune the lorde Regent constituted capitain, sir Philip
Hall, and so departed from thence to the citee of Roan, where, with triumph
(and not vnworthy) he was ioyously receiued and honorably feasted.
And after all thynges there set in an ordre, he remoued to Paris.
               
                  
                  HERE you maie see what succeded of the spirite of false Prophecie.
For the duke of Alaunson thinkyng it to be predestinate by the bodies
aboue, that he should ouercome, and conquere the duke of Bedford, bosted
(as you haue heard) to the Burgesses of Uernoile, that he had discōfited
the Regent of Fraunce with his whole armie, before the toune
of Yury: Not knowyng, that Mars the God of battaill beyng angry
with his liyng, appoynted, not onely all his puyssaunce to be vanquished
before Uernoile, but also hymself, and his bastarde vncle, there
to bee taken, and brought into bondage. So it is often seen that
he, whiche rekeneth without his hoste, muste reken twyse, and he
that fisheth before the net, maie lese, but nothyng gain. When this victory
was published through Fraunce, how the common peope lamented
their miserable destiny, how the nobilitie mistrusted their awne estate,
and how the Dolphyn was abashed, yea, more then abashed, wō
                  derfull
it were to write, but more merueilous for to heare. For he was
driuen out of all the countreis apperteinyng to the croune of Fraunce,
and might resort to no coūtreis, except to Burbonoys, Aluerne, Berry,
Poyctou, Towrayn, a part of Aniow and Barrayn, &amp; Longnedoe. And
because diuerse of his frendes, whiche were aduocates in Paris, exiled
thēselfes frō the parliament of Paris, whiche was with al rightes, and
iurisoiccions there vnto belongyng, kepte, and holden in the name of
kyng Henry the sixte, as lawfull heire and very kyng of the realme of
Fraunce: he therefore to shewe hymself as a kyng, erected his courte of
Parliament, his Chauncery, and all other courtes in the citee of Poytiers,
and there established his greate seale, with all due circumstaunces
thervnto aperteinyng, whiche there continued by the space of .xiiij.
yeres, as you shall after heare declared. The duke of Bedford liyng at
Paris, entendyng there to bryng to obeysaunce Charles the dolphyn,
or els to driue hym out of his litle cony holdes, and small countries, sēt
the lorde Scales, sir Ihon Montgomerey, sir Ihon Fastolfe, with two
thousand men, to conquere the countries of Aniow and Mayn, whiche
without assaulte had rendred to thē the strong castles of Beamount le
Uicōt, Teune, Silly, Oste, Courceriers, Roussy, Uasse, Couetemenāt
and twenty other, whiche for prolixitie of tyme, I thynke necessary to
bee omitted. For surely the Englishe puyssaunce was so tried, proued,
assaied, and spred abrode throughout all Fraunce, that the Frenche mē
thought that in conclusion the Englishe men would haue, or should
haue al thinges, whiche thei either wisshed or enterprised. The duke of
Bedford yet thirstyng after more good fortune, sente the erle of Salisbury,
with a greate armie accompained with the lorde Scales, and other
approued capitaines, (whose names you haue heard before) into
the countrees of Aniow &amp; Mayn, whiche wer euil neighbors to the duchy
of Normandy: in whiche army wer x.M. men of war or ther about.
These lusty capitaines entered firste into the countrey of Mayne, and
beseged the riche and strong citee of Mauns, the chief toune &amp; emperie

of all that country and region. And although the citezens, aswel for the
sodain accesse of their enemies, as for the feare of the name of therie of
Salisbury (whiche was both dread of his enemies, and honored of his
frendes,) wer somewhat amased and astonied: Yet their capitaines named
sir Baldwyn of Champaigne lord of Toisse, sir Guilliam de Marignie,
and sir Hugh de Goos, studied and muented all waies possible
how to defend themselfes, and do damage and harme to their enemies:
and surely, thei had within the toune a crewe and a compainei of warlike
and practised souldiors. The Englishemen approched as nigh to
the walles as thei might without their losse and detriment, and shot against
their walles great stones out of great gonnes (whiche kynd of
engines before yt tyme, was very litle seen or heard of in Fraunce,) the
strokes wh
                     •
                  rof so shaked, crushed and riued y• walles, that within fewe
daies, the citee was dispoyled of all her toures and outward defences.
The citezens of Mauns muche merueilyng at these newe orgaynes,
bothe seyng their destrucciō iminent, and desperate of all aide and succor,
offered the toune vpon this condicion: that all persones whiche
would tary within the toune might abide, and all that would departe
with horsse and harnessse onely, should be permitted: whiche offers were
accepted, and the toune rendred, wherof the erle made capitain therle
of Suffolke, and his liuetenaunt sir Ihon Fastolfe. After this the said
erle of Salis
                     •
                  ury besieged the faire toune of sainct Susan, whereof
was capitain, Ambrose de Lore, a mā of no lesse audacitie then pollicy,
accompainied with a greate nombre of hardy men of warre. When the
the erle of Salisbury had bothe viewed and seen the situacion and nature
of the place, he determined to assaulte it in that place whiche was
moste weake and worne: and so the trompettes blew to the assault, an
                     •
                  
scalyng ladders were raised to the walles, and the Englishemen with
greate noyse began to clime and ascende. The souldiors whiche durste
not come out of the toune to encountre with the Englishe armie, manfully
ranne to the walles to resiste and defende the assaylantes. And so
all that daie the assault with many aduenturrs still continued, and although
the inhabitauntes and citezens were sore wounded, thei neuer
lette of bothe to defende theimselfes, and to anoye and hurte their enemies.
When therle perceiued that by this light assault and slight skirmishe
he lost somewhat, and gained nothyng, he made a wall and cast a
trenche round about y• toune: &amp; caused his great ordynance to be shotte
at that part of the wall whiche was moste teble and slender, and so daily
and nightly he neuer ceassed to beate, and breke doune the wall and
toures: so that within twoo daies the moste part of the wal was persed
and cast doune to the ground. When the capitain perceiued these newe
feates, he began to entreate, and offered for hymself and his souldiors,
twoo thousand crounes, so that thei might departe in their doublettes
onely▪ so their liues were saued, whiche some because winter aproched,
was taken, and the toune yelded. Of the whiche toune he made capitain,

sir Ihon Popham, a valiaunt and a circūspect knight. After that
the said erle besieged the toune and castle of Mayon la Iuhez, wherein
was capitain the lorde of Escotaiz: whiche toune after the space of fiue
wekes was yelded (the lifes of the defendors onely saued.) To the kepyng
whereof he appointed sir Ihon Montgomery knight. And after
the feast of the purificacion of our lady, he besieged the castle de lafort
Barnard: duryng which siege, a sale was made of the toune of Alansō,
beyng in the Englishmens possession by a Gascoyn &amp; one of the garisō
there, for .iiii.C. crounes, to Charles de Uilliers, Peter le Beuffe, and
other Frenche capitaines. When the daie was apointed of the deliueraunce
bothe of the toune and the money, the Gascoigne opened and
discouered the whole agrement to the erle of Salisbury: whiche ordeined
the lorde Willoughby and sir Ihon Fastolfe with two thousande
Englishemen to encountre with the byers of the kynges toune of Alā
                  son.
At the daie apointed and tyme assigned, Charles de Uilliers chief
marchaunt of this riche enterprise, early in the mornyng with two .C.
horssemen, and three hundred footemen approched nere the toune, and
abidyng for the Gascoyne, he there displaied his banner, thynkyng triumphantly
to entre into the toune: but it happened otherwise. For or
thei wer ware, or suspected any rescues, thei wer enuironed with the Englishe
armie, and slain &amp; taken euery creature, saue Peter Danthenazy
and .xxv. other, whiche by the swiftnes of their horsses saued thē selfes.
               
                  AFTER this conflict ended, the lorde Willoughby with his cōpany
returned to therle of Salisbury, before the toune le Fort Barnard: the
capitaines wherof consideryng, that there was no hope of succor to be
sente to theim, and that their vitaill diminished, and that thei were not
long able to abide the harde assaultes of the English nacion, rendered
the toune and castle, reseruyng to them their horsse and harneis onely,
whiche toune therle receiued to the vse of the kyng: But the regent for
the valiaunt seruice doen by the erle, gaue thesame toune to hym and
to his heires for euer. Beside this therle partely by assaulte, partely by
composicion, toke diuerse other tounes, as sainct Kales, wher he made
capitain, Richard Gethyne Esquier, Thanceaux Lermitage, where he
made gouernor, Matthewe gough, Guerlande, of the whiche he assigned
ruler, Ihon Banaster, Malicorne, wherof he made capitain, William
Glasdale esquier, Lisle soubz Boultō, wherof was made capitain,
sir Lancelot Lisle knight, Lowpellande, whereof was made capitain,
Henry Braunche, Mountseur, of the whiche was made Constable, sir
Williā Oldhall knight, la Suke, was assigned to the kepyng of Ihō
Suffolk esquier, and beside this, aboue .xl. castles and piles wer ouerthrowen
and destroyed. When the fame and report of these newes wer
blowen through Fraunce, some f
                     ••
                  ated, some feared, and some raged
for angre: But the veritie of al thynges beyng by the duke of Bedford
declared into Englande, all men reioysed and wer very glad: not onely
for the conquest of so many tounes, but also that God had sente theim

victory in a pitched felde, and in a mortall battaill. Wherfore generall
processions wer commaunded, to rendre to God almighty humble and
harty thankes, by whose onely gift, nad not by power of man, these notable
victories wer gotten and achiued.
               
                  IT is not cōuenient, that I should talke so muche of Fraunce, &amp; omit
al thynges doen in England. Wherfore, you shall vnderstand, ye about
easter this yere, y• kyng called his high court of parliamēt, at his toune
of Westminster, &amp; cōmyng to the parliament hous he was conueighed
through the citee vpon a great courser with great triūph, whiche child
was iudged of al men, not only to haue the very ymage, y• liuely portra
ture, and louely countenaunce of his noble parent and famous father,
but also like to succede, and be his heire in all morall vertues, marcial
Pollicies, and Princely feates, as he was vndoubted inheritor to his
realmes, seigniories &amp; dominions. In whiche parliament was graunted
to the kyng a subsidy of .xii.d. of the pound, towardes the mainteinaunce
of the warres, of all marchaundise commyng into this realme,
or goyng out of thesame, besides other somes sette on euery tonne of liquor
and on euery sacke of woolle, aswel of Englishe men, as of straū
                  gers.
Duryng whiche Parliamente came to London, Peter Duke of
Quymber, sonne to the kyng of Portyngale, and cosin germain remoued
to the kyng, which of the duke of Excester and the bishop of Winchester
his vncles, was highly fested, and liberally rewarded, and was
elected into the noble ordre of the Garter. Duryng whiche season, Edmonde
Mortimer, the last Erle of Marche of that name (whiche long
tyme had been restrained from his liberty, and finally waxed lame) disceased
without issue, whose inheritaunce discended to lorde Richarde
Plantagenet, sonne and heire to Richard erle of Cambridge, beheded,
as you haue heard before, at the toune of Southhāpton. Whiche Richard
within lesse then .xxx. yeres, as heire to this erle Edmond, in opē
parliament claimed the croune and scepter of this realme, as herafter
shall more manifestly appere. In the tyme of whiche Parliament also,
whether it were, either for deserte or malice, or to auoyde thynges that
might chaunce, accordyng to a prouerbe, whiche saith, a dead man doth
no harme: Sir Ihon Mortimer cosin to the said erle was attainted of
treason and put to execucion: of whose deathe no small slaunder arose
emongest the common people.
               
                  AFTER all these actes doen in Englande, and in Fraunce, Humfrey
duke of Gloucester, with the lady Iaquet his supposed wife, passed
the sea, and came to Mons in Henawde, and there by force toke all
suche landes, as Ihon duke of Brabant her first husbande had in possession
of the said lady Iaquet, whiche doyng, Philippe duke of Burgoyne,
beyng greate frende to the duke of Brabant, muche disdained
and more frouned at, and thought for the olde loue and familiaritie,
that he hare to the duke of Gloucester, that he would by frendly monicion,
turne hym from his vnhonest and vngodly life, to a reasonable

reformacion, and brotherly conformitie. Wherefore he wrote louyngly
to hym, that he should vtterly leaue of, any further to folowe the
newe attempted enterprise, aduertisyng hym, and protestyng openly,
that the vsurpyng and wrongfully withholdyng of another mannes
possession, was not so vile and slaunderous, as the defilyng of a pure &amp;
cleane bedde, and adulteriously kepyng the wife of his christē brother.
The duke of Gloucester beyng in this case very wilfull, either blinded
with dotage, or inflamed with coueteousnesse of his wifes possessions,
regardyng neither the admonishement of the duke of Brabant, nor yet
the godly aduerti
                     •
                  ement of the duke of Burgoyn, sware that he would
not leaue of to make farther war, till he had expulsed the duke of Brabant,
out of his wifes seigniories, territories &amp; dominions. Wherfore,
the duke of Burgoyn assembled together a greate armie to make war
on the duke of Gloucester, in the cause &amp; quarel of the duke of Brabant
his frend and cosyn. The duke of Gloucester, partly for great affaires,
that then wer imminent in the realme of England, and partly to assemble
more people, to resist and withstād the power of the dukes of Burgoyn
and Brabant, left his wife at Mons in Henaude, with the lordes
of the toune, whiche sware to hym, to defende and kepe her against all
men, till the tyme of his returne. Wherefore he leauyng with her twoo
thousande Englishmen, departed to Calice, and so into Englande.
               
                  VVHEN he was gone, the duke of Burgoyn so threatened, so vexed,
yea, and almost so famished them within the toune of Mons, that thei
deliuered into his possession the lady Iaquet or Iacomyne: whiche incōtinent
sent her to Gaunt, wher she disguised her self in a mannes apparel,
and so escaped into a toune of her awne in Zelande, called Zirice,
and frō thence she was conueighed to a toune in Hollande called Tregowe,
where she was honorably receiued, &amp; there made herself strong
to withstande her enemies: And for her succor the Duke of Gloucester
sent to her fiue hundred mē. The dukes of Burgoyn and Brabant left
her not all in quiet, but brent her tounes in Holland, and slewe her people
in Zelande to her greate detriment and displeasure. But inconclusion,
this matter was brought before Martyn the .v. bishop of Rome:
whiche adiudged the first matrimony with duke Ihon of Brabant, to
be good and effectuall, and the seconde espousals celebrated with duke
Humfrey of Gloucester, to bee of no value, force nor effecte: and that if
the duke of Brabant died, it should not be lawfull to the duke of Gloucester,
to mary again with the lady Iaquet. The duke of Gloucester obeiyng
to this sentence, beganne to waxe lothe of his supposed wife, by
whō he neuer had profite but losse: for whose cause his frendes became
his enemies, &amp; for whose sake he was openly slaundered. Wherfore he,
by wanton affeccion blinded, toke to his wife Elianor Cobham doughter
to the lord Cobham, of Sterberow, whiche before (as the fame wēt)
was his soueraigne lady and paramour, to his great slaunder and reproche.
And if he wer vnquieted with his other pretensed wife, truly he

was tenne tymes more vexed, by occasion of this woman, as you shall
herafter plainly perceiue: so that he began his mariage with euill, and
ended it with worse. The Lady Iaquet after the death of Ihon duke
of Brabant, maried a gentleman of meane estate, called Frāke of Bursellen,
for the whiche cause the duke of Burgoyn imprisoned her housbande,
and left her in greate trouble: suche was the ende of these twoo
mariages.
            
            
               ¶The fourth yere.The .iii
                        •
                     . yere.
               
               
                  A Litle before this tyme, sir Thomas Rampstone, sir Philip
Branche, sir Nicholas Burdeit, and other Englishemen
to the nombre of .v. hundred men, repaired and fortified
the toune of sainct Iames de Leitron, on the frontiers
of Normandy, adioynyng to Britayn. Arthure erle
of Richemond and Iury brother to the duke of Britayn,
whiche like an vntrue gentleman, sworne and forsworne to the kyng of
England, sodainly fled to Charles the Dolphyn: whiche muche reioysyng
of his fauor and amity, gaue to hym the Constableship of Fraūce
whiche therle of Boughan slain before at Uernoyl, a small tyme occupied,
and lesse space enioyed. This newe Constable not a litle ioyful of
his high office, thought to do some pleasure to y• dolphyn his master, &amp;
to aduaūce his name at the first entry into his authoritie, he imagined
no enterprise to be to hym more honorable, nor to his prince more acceptable,
then to auoyde and driue out of the toune of sainct Iames de
Beueon, al the Englishe nacion. So in hope of victory gathered together
aboue .xl.M. men, of Britons, Frenchemen and Scottes, and enuironed
the toune of sainct Iames, or sainct Iaques de Beuron, with
a strong siege. The Englishemen within, whiche in nombre passed not
vj.C. men, manfully defended the daily assaultes of the fierce Frenche
men. The Englishemen consulted together what waie was best to bee
taken: and after long debatyng, thei determined to issue out of y• toune
and to fight with their enemies. So on a daie, when the Britons were
weried with a long assaulte, towardes the euenyng the Englishemen
came out of the toune, one parte by the posterne of the Castle, and another
part by the gate of the toune, criyng saincte George, Salisburye:
and set on their enemies bothe before and behind. The Frenchemen seyng
the corage of the Englishemen, and hearyng their crie, thynkyng
that therle of Salisbury was come to raise the siege, ranne awaie like
shepe, and there wer taken, slain and drouned in the water, of them .iiii.
thousand men and mo. Besides this, these ioly gallantes left behynde
theim for hast, all their tentes .xiiii. greate gonnes, and .xl. barrelles of
pouder .CCC. pipes of wine, CC. pipes of bisket and floure, CC. frailes
of Figges and resons, and .v.C. barrelles of heryng.
               
                  THE Frenchmen (beyng thus vanquished) fel in diuision emongest
theimselfes: the one laiyng to the charge of the other, the losse of their

men and the cause of their fliyng. Suche is euer the chaūce of the war,
that when victorie is obteined, the moste coward and faint harted boy
will boste and bragge, and when the battaill is loste, the faulte is assigned
to the beste, and not to the wourste. The newe Constable was sore
dismaied &amp; muche ashamed of this discomfiture and shamefull flight,
but there was no remedy but pacience: But to the entent to blotte out
and deface this shamfull fliyng with a notable victory, he with a great
armie entered into the countrey of Aniowe, and brente, spoyled and destroyed
two or thre at the moste, litle poore thetched villages: Whiche
smal acte doen, his malice was quēched, &amp; his old grief (as he thought)
victoriously reuenged.
               
                  IN this season fell a greate diuision in the realme of England, whiche,
of a sparcle was like to growe to a greate flame: For whether the
bishop of Winchester called Henry Beaufort, sonne to Ihon Duke of
Lancastre, by his third wife, enuied the authoritee of Humfrey duke of
Gloucester Protector of the realme, or whether the duke had taken disdain
at the riches and pompous estate of the bishop, sure it is that the
whole realme was troubled with them and their partakers: so that the
citezens of London fearyng that that should insue vpon the matter,
wer faine to kepe daily and nightly, watches, as though their enemies
were at hande, to besiege and destroye theim: In so muche that all the
shoppes within the cite of London wer shut in for feare of the fauorers
of those two greate personages, for eche parte had assembled no small
nombre of people. For pacifiyng whereof, the Archebishop of Cantorbury,
and the duke of Quymber called the prince of Portyngale, rode
eight tymes in one daie betwene the twoo aduersaries, and so the matter
was staied for that tyme. The bishoppe of Winchester not content
with his nephewe the lorde Protector, seute a letter to the Regente of
Fraunce, the tenor wherof insueth.
               
                  
                     RIGHT high and mighty prince, and my right noble and after one,
leuest lorde, I recommend me vnto you with all my harte. And as you
desire the welfare of the kyng our souereigne lorde, and of his realmes
of England and Fraunce, and your awne health and ours also, so hast
you hether. For by my trouth if you tary, we shall put this lande in aduenture,

                  THE duke of Bedford beyng sore greued and vnquieted with these
newes, constituted the erle of Warwicke, whiche was lately come into
Fraunce, with sixe thousande men his liuetenaunte in the Frenche dominions
and in the duchy of Normandy, and so with a small company,
he with the duches his wife, returned again ouer the seas into Englād
and the tenth daie of Ianuary, he was with all solemnitie receiued into
London, to whom the citezens gaue a paire of basynnes, and a thousande

marke in money, and from London he rode to Westminster, and
was lodged in the kynges palaice. The, xxv. daie of Marche after his
cōmyng to London, a parliamēt began at the toune of Leicester, where
the Duke of Bedford openly rebuked the Lordes in generall, because
that thei in the tyme of warre, through their priuie malice and inwarde
grudge, had almoste moued the people to warre and commocion, in
whiche tyme all men, ought or should be of one mynde, harte and consent:
requiryng them to defend, serue and drede their soueraigne 
                     •
                  orde
kyng Henry, in perfourmyng his conquest in Fraunce, whiche was in
maner brought to conclusion. In this parliament the Duke of Gloucester,
laied certain articles to the bishoppe of Wynchesters charge, the

                  ¶The articles of accusacion, and accord, betwene

                     FIRST, where as he beyng protector and defendor of this lande, desired
the toure to be opened to hym, and to lodge hym therein, Richard
Woodeuile esquire, hauyng at that tyme the charge of the kepyng of
the toure, refused his desire, and kepte thesame toure against hym, vnduly
and against reason, by the commaundement of my saied Lorde of
Winchester: and afterward in approuyng of thesaid refuse, he receiued
thesaid Wodeuile, and cherished hym against the state and worship of
the kyng, and of my saied lorde of Gloucester.
                  
                     
                     ITEM my said lorde of Winchester, without the aduise and assente

and set men in chambers, sellers and windowes, with bowes

and arrowes and other weapons, to thentent to bryng to final destruccion

should come with hym.
                  
                     ITEM my saied lorde of Gloucester saith and affirmeth, that our souereigne 
lorde his brother, that was kyng Henry the fifth, told hym on
a time, when our said souereigne lorde beyng prince, was lodged in the
palaice of Westminster in the greate chambre, by the noyes of a spanyell

                     FIRST, as of the refuse made vnto my Lorde of Gloucester, of openyng 
the toure to hym, of his lodgyng therin, by the cōmaundement of
my saied lorde of Wynchester, he answereth: that in the presence of my
said lorde of Gloucester, before his commyng out of his countey of Henawd,
for causes suche as wer thought reasonable, it semeth lefull that
the toure should haue been notably stuffed and kept with vitaile, how
beit, it was not furthwith executed, and that in likewise after, that my
saied lorde of Gloucester was gone into his saied countrey of Henawd
for sedicious and odious billes &amp; language, cast and vsed in the cite of
London, sounyng of insurreccion &amp; rebellion against the kinges peace,
and destruccion aswel of diuerse estates of this land, as straungers beyng

great nombre fled the land: &amp; for the more sure kepyng of thesaid toure,
Richard Wooduile squire, so trusted with y• kyng our souereigne lorde
that dead is, (as wel ye knowe) and also chamberlain &amp; counsailer vnto
my lorde of Bedford, with a certain nombre of defensible persones assigned
vnto him, was made deputie ther, by thassent of y• kynges coūsail
being that tyme at London, for to abide therin for safegard therof, and

straightly charged by thesaied counsaill, that duryng that tyme of his
saied charge, he should not suffre any man to bee in the toure stronger
then hymself, without especial charge or commaundement of the kyng
by thaduise of his counsaill.
                  
                     
                     ITEM that after, sone vpon the cōmyng of my saied lorde of Gloucester

kept vnto the kyng, offeryng them therupon remedy if thei would.
                  
                     
                     ITEM, that after this, Richard Scot liuetenaunt of the toure, by
the commaundemēt of my said lorde of Gloucestre, brought vnto hym
Frier Randolfe, the whiche had long before confessed treason, doen by
hym against the kynges person that dead is, for the whiche knowledge
he was put to bee kepte in the saied toure, and straightly commaunded
vnder great pain geuen vnto the saied Scotte, to kepe hym straightly
and surely, and not to let hym out of the saied toure, without commaū

Sone after that he had brought the said Frier Randolf vnto my lorde
of Gloucestre, saiyng vnto my saied lorde of Winchester, that he was
vndone but he helped hym, and expressed as for cause of the saied withholdyng
of Frier Randolf: And saiyng more ouer, that when he desired
of my said lorde of Gloucestre, the deliueraunce of the said Frier Randolfe,
to leade hym again vnto the toure, or sufficient warraunt for his
discharge, my saied Lorde of Gloucestre aunswered hym, that his commaundement
was sufficient warraunt and discharge for hym. In the

that my saied lorde of Gloucester, toke vpon hym further then
his authoritie stretched vnto, and caused hym for to doubte &amp; dreade,
leste that he would haue proceaded further. And at suche tyme as the
saied Woodeuile came vnto hym to aske his aduise and counsaill, of
lodgyng of my saied lorde of Gloucester into the toure: he aduised
and charged him, that before he suffered my said lorde of Gloucester or
any person lodge therin stronger then hymself, he shoulde puruey hym
a sufficient warraunt thereof, of the kyng by thaduise of his counsaill.
                  
                     
                     ITEM as to the saied article of the foresaied causes of heuinesse, my
saied Lorde the Chauncellor answereth, that he neuer purposed to set
hande on the kynges person, nor to remoue hym, or that he shoulde bee
remoued, or put in any maner of gouernaunce, but by thaduise of the

kynges counsaill. For he could not conceiue any maner of goodnes or
of aduauntage that might haue growen vnto hym therof: But rather
greate perell and charge, and hereof my saied Lorde of Winchester is
redy to make profe in tyme and place conuenient.
                  
                     ITEM, as to the third article of the forsaid causes and heuinesse, my 
said lorde Chauncellor answereth, that he was ofte and diuerse tymes
warned by diuerse credible persones, aswell at the tyme of the kynges
laste Parliament, holden at Westminster, as before and sithe, that my
said lorde of Gloucester, purposed him bodely harme, and was warned
therof, and counsailed by the saied persones, and that diuerse tymes to
abstain hym frō commyng to Westminster, as my said Lorde of Winchester
declared vnto my saied lorde of Gloucester.
                  
                     ITEM, that in the tyme of thesaied Parliament diuerse persones of 
lowe estate, of the citee of London in greate nōbre, assembled on a daie
vpon the Wharffe, at the Crane of the Uintry, wished and desired that
thei had there the persone of my Lorde of Winchester, saiyng: that thei
would haue throwen hym into the Thamise, to haue taught hym to
swymme with winges. For whiche billes and language of slander and
threatenynges, cast &amp; spoken in the said cite, by my said lord the Chaū
                     cellor,
caused hym to suppose, that thei that so saied and did, willed and
desired his destruccion, although thei had no cause.
                  
                     ITEM, that after the cōmyng to London of sir Raufe Botiller and 
master Lewes, sent fro my Lorde of Bedford, to the rest of the lordes of
the counsaill, thei beyng informed that my saied Lorde of Gloucester,
did beare displeasure to my saied Lorde of Winchester: Thei came to
my saied lorde of Gloucester to his Ynne, the second Sondaie next before
Alhallowen daie, and there opened vnto hym, that thei had knowledge
and vnderstandyng of thesaied displeasure, praiyng hym to lette
theim knowe if he bare suche displeasure against my saied Lorde of
Winchester, and also the causes thereof. At the whiche tyme (as my
said lorde of Winchester was afterward informed) that my saied lorde
of Gloucestre, affirmed that he was heuy towarde hym, andnot withoutten
causes that paraduenture he would put in writyng.
                  
                     ITEM, that after the Mōdaie next before Alhallowen daie last past 
in the night, the people of thesaid citee of London, by the commaundement
of my said lorde of Gloucester, as it was said: For what cause my
lorde the Chaūcellor wist not, assembled in the citee, armed and arraied
and so continued all that night. Emongest diuerse of the whiche, (the
same night by what excitacion, my said lorde the Chauncellor wist not)
sedicious and heuie language was vsed, and in especiall against the
persone of my saied lorde the Chauncellor. And so thesame Mondaie at
night, my saied Lorde of Gloucester, sent vnto the Ynnes of Courte at
London, chargyng them of the Court dwellyng in thesame, to be with
hym vpon the morowe, at eight of the clocke in their best arraie.
                  
                     ITEM that on the morowe, beyng Tewesday next folowyng earely, 
                     
my saied lorde of Gloucester, sent vnto the Maire and Aldermen of the
saied citee of London, to ordain hym vnto the nombre of three hundred
persones on horssebacke, to accompany hym to suche place as he disposed
hym to ride, whiche (as it was saied) was vnto the kyng, to thentent
to haue his persone, and to remoue hym from the place that he was in,
without assent or aduise of the kynges counsail, the whiche thyng was
thought vnto my saied lorde the Chauncellor, that he ought in nowise
to haue doen, nor had not been sene so before.
                  
                     
                     ITEM that my saied lorde the chauncellor, consideryng the thynges
aboue said, and doubtyng therfore of perelles that might haue insued
thereof, intendyng to purueye there against, and namely for his awne
suretie and defence, accordyng to the lawe of nature, ordained to let
that no force of people, should come on the bridge of London towarde
hym, by the whiche he or his might haue been indaungered or noyed,
not intendyng in any wise, bodely harme vnto my saied lorde of Gloucester,
nor to any other persone, but onely his awne defence and eschewyng
the perell abouesaied.
                  
                     
                     ITEM as toward the fourth and fifth of the saied articles, my lorde
the Chauncellor answereth, that he was euer true, to al those that wer
his soueraigne Lordes, and reigned vpon hym, and that he neuer purposed
treason nor vntrouth against any of their persones, and in especiall
against the persone of our saied soueraigne lorde kyng Henry the
fifth. The whiche consideryng the greate wisedome, trouthe and manhod,
that all men knewe in hym, ne would not for the tyme that he was
kyng, haue set on my said lorde the Chauncellor so greate truste as he
did, if he had founde, or thought in hym suche vntrouthe. The whiche
thyng my saied Lorde the Chauncellor, offred to declare and shewe, as
it belōgeth to a man of his estate to do, requiryng therupon my lord of
Bedford, and all the lordes spirituall and temporal in this parliamēt,
that it might be sene, that there wer iudges cōuenient in this case, that
thei would do hym right, or els that he might haue leaue of the Kyng
by their aduise, to go sue his right, before hym y• ought to be his iudge.
                  
                     
                     AND as towarde the letter sent by my lord of Winchester, vnto my
lorde of Bedford, of the whiche the tenor is before rehersed, of the whiche
my lorde of Gloucestre complained hym of the malicious and vntrue
purpose of my said lord of Winchester, as toward the assemblyng
of the people and gatheryng of a feld in the kynges lāde, in troublyng
therof, and against the kinges peace: My said lorde of Winchester answereth,
that of his said letters duely vnderstande, &amp; in suche wise as he
vnderstod and meant in the writyng of them, it maie not reasonably be
gathered and taken, that my saied lorde of Winchester, intended to gather
any feld or assemble people, in troublyng of the kynges land, and
against the kinges peace, but rather he purposed to acquite hym to the
kyng in his trouthe, and to kepe the rest and peace in the kynges land,
and to eschew rebellion, disobedience and all trouble. For by that that

in the beginnyng of the said letter, he calleth my said lorde of Bedford,
his leuest lorde, after one, that is the kyng, whom he ought to except of
dutie of his trouthe, the whiche he hath euer kept and will kepe.
                  
                     MOREOVER in the saied lettre, he desireth the commyng 
home of my Lorde of Bedforde, for the welfare of the Kyng and of
his realmes of England and of Fraunce, the whiche stande principlly
in his kepyng of rest and peace, and praieth my saied lorde of Bedford,
to spede his commyng into England, in eschewyng of ieoperdy of
the lande, and of a felde the whiche he drade hym, might haue folowed
if he had long taried: As toward those wordes, and ye tary we shall pu
                        •
                     
this land in aduenture with a feld, suche a brother ye haue here, &amp;c. My
saied lorde of Winchester saieth, the sothe is: before or he wrote thesaid
letter, by occasion of certain ordinaunces, made by the Maire and Aldermen
of London, against the excessiue takyng of Masons, Carpentars,
Tilers, Plasterers and other laborers, for their daily iorneis and
approued by the Kynges aduise and his counsaill, there were caste
many heuinesses and sedicious billes, vnder the names of suche laborers,
thretenyng risyng with many thousandes, and manassyng of estates
of the lande, and likewise sedicious and euill language sowen, and
so continued and likely to haue sued of purpose and intent of disobedience
and rebellion. To redressyng of the whiche, it semed to my lorde
the Chauncellor, that my said lorde of Gloucester, did not his endeuor,
nor diligence that he might haue shewed, for lacke of whiche diligence,
thei that were disposed to do disobey saunce, were incoraged and inboldened.
So that it was like that thei should haue made a gatheryng,
and that the kyng and his true subiectes, should haue been compelled
to haue made a felde, to haue withstand theim, the whiche feld makyng
had been aduenturyng of this lande. And in tokenyng that it was neuer
my said lorde Chauncellors intent to gather no feld, but as trouth
moste stirred hym against suche as riotously, would make suche assemble
against our soueraigne Lorde, and the weale of this lande: He desired
so hastely, the commyng of my saied Lorde of Bedforde, the whiche
he would in no wise haue so greatly desired, if he would haue purposed
hym vnto any vnlawful makyng of a feld, for he wist wel that my said
lorde of Bedford would moste sharply haue chastised and punished, all
those that so would any riotous assēble make. When this answere was
made, the duke caused this writyng folowyng, opēly to be proclaymed.
                  Beit knowen to all folkes, that it is the intent of my lord of Bedford, 
and all the lordes spirituall and temporall, assembled in this present
parliament, to acquite hym and them, and to procede truly, iustely
and indifferently, without any parcialitie, in any maner of matters or
qurelles, moued or to bee moued, betwene my Lorde of Gloucester, on
that one partie, and my lorde of Winchester, Chauncellor of England
on that other party. And for sure keping of the kynges peace, it is accorded

by my saied lorde of Bedford, and by my saied lordes spiritual and
temporall, an othe to be made, in forme that foloweth, that is to saie.

and discrecions suffisen, truly, iustly and indifferently,
coūsaill and aduise the kyng, and also procede and acquite
them self, in al thesaid matters and quarelles, without that thei, or any
of theim, shall priuely and appertly, make or shewe hymself to be party
or parciall therin, not leuyng or eschewyng so to do, for affeccion, loue,
mede, doubt, or dreade of any persone or persones. And that thei shal in
all wise, kepe secrete all that shalbe commoned by waie of counsaill, in
the matters and quarrelles aboue said, in the said parliament, without
that thei or any of them shall, by worde, writyng of the kyng, or in any
wise open, or discouer it to any of thesaid parties, or to any other person
that is not of the saied counsail. But if he haue a speciall commaundement
or leaue thereto of the kyng, or of my saied lorde of Bedforde, and
that eche of them shall, with all his might and power, assist by waie of
counsaill, and els shewe it vnto the Kyng, my lorde of Bedforde, and to
the rest of my said lordes, to put the said parties to reasō, and not suffer
that any of the saied parties, by them or by their assistentes, procede or
attempte by waie of feit against the kynges peace: nor helpe, assiste, or
comfort any of them thereto, but let them with all their might and power,
and withstande them, and assist vnto the kyng and my saied Lorde
of Bedforde, in kepyng of the kynges peace, and redressyng all suche
maner of procedyng by waie of feit or force.

                     MY soueraigne Lorde I haue well vnderstande, that I am noysed
emong the states of your land, how that the kyng our soueraigne lorde
that was that tyme, beyng prince and lodged in the greate chamber at
Westminster, by the baiyng of a spanyell, there was on a night taken,
behynd a tapet in thesame chamber, a man, that should haue confessed,
that he was there by myne excitacion and procuryng to haue slain the
foresaied Prince there in his bedde, wherevpon thesaied erle, let sacke
hym furthwith, and drouned hym in the Thamise. And furthermore I
am accused, how that I should haue stirred the kyng that last died, the
tyme also that he was Prince, to haue taken the gouernaunce of this
realme, and the croune vpō him, liuyng his father thesame tyme beyng
kyng: Through whiche language and noysyng, I fele my name and
fame greatly enblemisshed, in diuerse mennes opinions. Where vpon
I take firste God to my witnesse, and afterwarde all the worlde, that I
haue been at all tymes, &amp; am true louer and true man, to you my soueraigne
Lorde, and shalbe all my life. And also I haue been to my soueraigne
lorde, that was your father, all time of his reigne, true man: and
for suche, he toke trust and cherished me to his liues end, and as I trust
no man will affirme the contrary, nor neuer in my life procuryng, nor imagenyng
death nor distrucciō of his person, ne assentyng to any suche
thyng, or like thereto, the tyme that he was Kyng or Prince, or els in other
estate. And in like wise, I was true man to Kyng Henry the .iiij.
all the time that he was my soueraigne lorde, and reigned vpon me: In
which matters, in all maner of wise, that it liketh to you my soueraigne
lorde for to commaunde me, I am ready for to declare me: And further
more, where, how and when, it shall like you by thaduise of your counsaill
to assigne me. Wherefore, I beseche you my soueraigne Lorde, as
humbly as I can, consideryng that there is no grounded processe, by
the whiche I might lawfully, in these matters aboue saied be conuict,
blessed be God, to holde me and declare me, by thaduise of al the lordes
spirituall and temporall, beyng in this presente Parliament, true man
to you my soueraigne lord, &amp; so to haue been vnto my souereigne lords
that wer your father and graūdfather, and true man also, to haue been
at all tymes vnto his saied father, whilest he was Prince, or els in any
other estate, the said slaunder and nosyng notwithstandyng. And this
same declaracion to be enacted, in this your saied present parliament.
                  
                     THE which wordes declared in maner as it is aboue said by my said
lorde of Winchester, it semeth to my saied lords the arbitratours, that
it is fittyng that my said lorde of Winchester drawe hym a part, and in
the meane tyme, the Lordes beyng present, bee singulerly examined

as my saied lorde of Winchester desireth, let hym be called again, and
that then my lord of Bedford, then haue these wordes in effect yt folowē
                  
                  
                     FAIRE vncle, my Lorde, by the aduise of his counsaill, hath commaunded
me to saie to you, that he hath well vnderstande and considered

al the matters whiche ye haue here openly declared in his presence,
and thereupon ye desire a peticion that he will declare you, and by the
aduise and assent of the lordes spirituall and temporall, beyng in this
presente Parliamente, he declareth you a true man to hym, and that ye
haue so bee to my lorde his father and his graundfather, and also true
man to my Lorde his father whiles he was Prince or els in any other
estate, thesaied dis
                        •
                     aunder and noysyng notwithstandyng: And will
that thesaied declaracion be so enacted in this present Parliament. After
the whiche wordes thus saied, as before is declared, by thesaied lordes
arbitratours, that my saied lorde of Winchester, should haue these
wordes that foloweth, to my saied lorde of Gloucester.
                  
                     MY Lorde of Gloucester, I haue conceiued to my greate heuinesse
that ye should haue receiued by diuerse reportes, that I should haue
purposed and imagined against your persone, honor and estate, in dyuer
                        •
                     e
maners, for the whiche ye haue takē against me great displeasure
Sir I take God to my witnes, that what reportes so euer haue been to
you of me, paraduenture of suche as haue had no greate affeccion to
me, GOD forgeue it them, I neuer imagined, ne purposed any thyng
that might be hynderyng or preiudice to your persone, honor, or estate.
And therfore, I praie you that ye be vnto me good lord from this time
furthe, for by my will I gaue neuer other occasion, nor purpose not to
do hereafter through Goddes grace.
                  The whiche wordes so by hym saied, it was decreed by the said arbitratours,
that my lorde of Gloucester should answere and saie.
                  Faire Uncle, sithe ye declare you suche a man as ye saie, I am right
glad that it is so and for suche a man I take you.
                  And when this was doen, it was decreed by the saied arbitratours
that euery ech of my lordes of Gloucester and Winchester should take
either other by the hande, in the presence of the kyng and all the parliament,
in signe and token of good loue and accord, the whiche was doen
and the Parliament was adiourned till after Easter.
                  When the greate fire of this discencion, betwene these twoo noble
personages, was thus by the arbitratours to their knowledge and
iudgement, vtterly quenched out, and laied vnder boord all other controuersies
betwene other Lordes, takyng parte with the one partie or
the other, wer sone apeased and brought to concord. For ioy wherof, the
kyng caused a solēpne feast, to be kept on Whitson sondaie, on the whiche
daie, he created Richard Plantagenet, sonne and heire to the erle of
Cambridge (whom his father at Hampton, had put to execucion, as
you before haue hearde) Duke of Yorke, not forseyng before, that this
prefermēt should be his destruccion, nor that his sede should, of his generacion,
bee the extreme ende and finall confusion. He the same daie
also promoted Ihon Lorde Mowbrey and Erle Marshall, sonne and
heire to Thomas duke of Norffolke, by kyng Richard the seconde exiled
this realme and dominion, to the title, name, and stile of the Duke

of Norffolke, duryng whiche feaste, the Duke of Bedforde adourned
the kyng with the high ordre of knighthode, whiche on thesame daie
dubbed with the sweard these knightes whose names ensue.

                     AFTER this solempne feast ended, a great aide and subsidye was
graunted, for the continuaunce of the conquest in Fraunce, and so money
was gathered, and men wer prepared in euery citee, toune and coū
                     trey:
duryng whiche busines, Thomas duke of Excester, the sadde, wise
and wel learned coūsailer, great vncle to the kyng, departed out of this
mortal life, at his manner of Grnewiche, &amp; was with al funeral pompe,
conueyed through London to Berry, and there buried. In whiche yere
also died the Lady Elizabeth his halfe sister, &amp; of the whole bloud with
kyng Henry the .iiij. maried to lorde Ihon Hollande duke of Excester,
and after to the lord Fanhope, buried at the Blacke Friers of London.
                  
                     VVHILE these thynges wer thus appoyntyng and concludyng in
Englande: The erle of Warwicke leuetenaunt for the Regente in the
realme of Fraunce, entered into the countrey of Mayne, and besieged
the toune of Chasteau de Loyre, the whiche shortly to hym was rēdered
wherof he made capitain Matthew Gough esquire. After that, he toke
by assaute the castle of Mayet, and gaue it for his valeauntnes to Ihō
Winter esquire, &amp; after that he conquered the castle of Lund, and made
there gouernor, William Gladdisdale gentleman. At whiche place he
was informed, that the Frenchemen were assembled together, in the
countrey of Beausse, wherfore like a valyaunt capitain, he with all his
power marched thetherwarde, to encountre with his enemies, and to
fight with his aduersaries, whiche hauyng knowledge of his approchyng,
fled, and durste not abide the triall, nor ieoperde the aduenture,

and in his returnyng, he beseged the Castle of Montdublean, whereof
was capitain sir Robertō des Croix, whiche siege cōtinued thre wekes,
but in conclusion the Englishemen, so sore charged theim with in, that
the capitain with his whole company, were contente to yelde the castle,
their liues, horse and harneis, onely re
                        •
                     erued: Whiche to them was after
long consultacion had, and many agrementes made, frankely graū
                     ted.
And the saied erle of Warwicke, leauyng there the valeaunt lorde
Willoughby, returned again to Paris. Duryng whiche season, he
was ordained by the assent of the thre estates of the realme of Englāde
to be gouernor of the young kyng, in like maner as the noble Duke of
Excester before his death was appoynted and assigned, but yet he taried
still in Fraunce, and did there no small seruice as you shall here
after perceiue.
               
            
            
               ¶The fifth yere.The .v. yere.
               
               
                  THE Regent of Fraunce thus beeyng in Englande,
meanes was made by the Duke of Burgoyne, for the
deliuery of the Duke of Alanson, whiche was taken
prisoner at the battaill of Uernoyle the last yere. So
he for the some of twoo hundred thousande crounes,
was deliuered and set at large: but neither for release
of all or abatement of part of his raunsome, he would
in no wise acknowledge the kyng of Englande, to bee his liege and souereigne
Lorde: Suche affeccion bare he to the Dolphyn, and suche
trouth shewed he to his natural countrey. When all thynges wer concluded,
ordered and established, bothe for the conseruacion of peace
and tranquilitie within the realme of Englande, and also for the maintenaunce
of warre, for the finall gainyng of the region of Fraunce:
The Duke of Bedforde and his wife, tooke their leaue of the Kyng, at
Westminster and landed at Calice, with whō also passed the seas, Henry
bishop of Winchester, whiche in thesaied toune was inuested with
the Habite, Hatte and dignitie of a Cardinall, with all Ceremonies to
it appertainyng. Whiche degree, kyng Henry the fifth knowyng the
haute corage, and the ambicious mynde of the man, prohibited hym on
his allegeaunce once, either to sue for or to take, meanyng that Cardinalles
Hattes should not presume to bee egall with Princes. But now
the kyng beyng young and the Regent his frende, he obteined that dignitie,
to his greate profite, and to the empouerishyng of the spiritualtie.
For by a Bull legatyue, whiche he purchased at Rome, he gathered
so muche treasure, that no man in maner had money but he, and so
was he surnamed the riche Cardinall of Winchester, and nether called
learned bishop, nor verteous priest.
               
                  AFTER that, the duke of Bedford was returned into Fraunce, the
lorde of Rustinan Marshall of Britayn, assembled a greate company
of the Britishe nacion, whiche fortefied &amp; repaired the toune of Pountorson,

and after thesaied Marshall, with a thousand men entered into
the countrey of Constantyne in Normandy, and came before the toune
of Auranches. Thenglishmen within the garrison, issued out &amp; boldly
fought with their enemies: but after long conflicte and many strokes
geuen, the Britons wer ouer come, and the lorde Rustynan taken, and
the moste parte of his people slaine. The Duke of Bedforde hearyng
that the toune of Pountorson was newly fortified and strongly defended,
sent thither the erle of Warwicke, accōpanied with the lorde Scales,
and diuerse other valiaunt capitaines and souldiers, to the nombre
of .vij. thousande men to besiege the toune, whiche so enuironed it
on euery parte, that neither man could steale out, nor beast could passe
in. The siege long continuyng, vitaill began to waxe scant in the Englishe
armie, wherefore the Lorde Scales hauyng in his company, sir
Ihon Harpeley Bayly of Constantine, sir William Brearton Bayly
of Caen, sir Raufe Tesson, sir Ihon Carbonell and .iii. thousand good
men of war, departed frō the siege to get vitail, pouder and other thynges
necessary for their purpose and enterprise. And as thei were returnyng
with their cariage on the sea cost, nere to. S. Michaels Moūt,
thei sodainly wer encountred with their enemies, wherof the chief wer,
the Baron of Coloses, the lorde Dausebost capitain of thesaid Mount
the lorde Mountabon, the lorde Mountburchier, the lorde of Chasteau
Giron, the lord of Tyntygnat, the lord of Chasteau Brian with .vi.M
men of warre. The lorde Scales and his company (seyng that thei wer
compassed on euery side with deadly daungiers, for the sea was on the
one side, and their enemies on the other, and no meane waie to escape
of flie, discended from their horsses and like gredy Lions, together in
an vnpeaceable fury, set on their enemies. The skirmishe was strong &amp;
the fight was fierce, the Englishmen kept themselfes so close, that their
enemies could haue no auantage of them. At the last the lorde Scales
cried S. George, thei flie, with that thenglishmen toke suche a corage, &amp;
the Frenchmen that fought before, were so dismaied that thei began to
flie. The Englishmen leped again on horssebacke, and folowed theim,
and slewe and toke aboue .xi.C. persones, emongest whō wer taken, the
Baron of Colsoes, and the lorde of Chasteau Brian and xxx. knightes.
               
                  AFTER this victory, the Lorde Scales with his vitailes, prouision
and prisoners, returned to the siege, where he was of the Erle and
other noble men, ioyously receiued and for this notable facte, highly
magnified and preysed. While the siege thus continued before Pountorson,
Christopher Hanson and other souldiers of the garrison of. S.
Susan, made a rode into the countrey of Anioy, &amp; came to a Castle called
Ramffort, which castle was so priuely scaled, that the capitain with
in &amp; his company, wer taken or slain before thei knewe of their enemies
approchyng. When knowledge of this feate was made open to the
Frenchemen, whiche were assembled to the nombre of .xx.M. to reyse
the siege, and breake vp the campe, liyng before the toune of Pountorson,

thei lefte that iourney for a tyme, and returned to the Castle of
Ramffort, and besieged thesame by the space of tenne daies.
               
                  THE Englishemen consideryng the multitude of the enemies, and
the farre absence of their frendes, began to treate with the Frenchmen
and so vpon condicion to departe with bagge and baggage, horse and
harnes, thei rendered vp the castle, and departed with more riches then
thei brought, whiche castle thus possessed by the Frenchemen, thei forgat
the reskew of Poūtorson, and brake vp their army. But sone after,
the lorde of Raix, callyng himself liuetenaunt general for the dolphin,
accompanyed with the lorde Mount Iehan, the Lorde Beaumanoire,
and the lord Tussye, and other to the nōbre of thre thousande persones,
entered into the countrey of Mayn, &amp; laied siege to the castle of Malycorne,
wherof was capitain an Englishmā, called Oliuer Osbaters
                     •
                  y,
which castle with the capitain, was by force taken and obteined: in like
maner thei toke the litle castle of Lude, and there in William Blackeborne
leuetenaunt for Williā Glasdale esquire, &amp; put hym to raūsome,
and slewe al his souldiers. After this victory, in the whiche thei muche
gloried; the Frenchmen perceiuing that therle of Warwicke continued
stil his siege before the toune of Pountorson, &amp; knowyng by their espials,
that the Englishmen wer determined to geue them battaill, if thei
once attempted to rayse the siege, and therefore fearyng to fight in an
open battaill, reculed backe again to the dolphyn with litle gain and
small honor. The Frenchmen and Britons beyng straightly besieged
within the toune of Pountorson, perceiuyng no likelyhod of succors to
come, and seyng the Englishe army daily did increase, fearyng the sequele
therof, if thei by violence should bee taken and vanquished, thei
offered the toune, so that thei might departe with horse and harnes onely:
whiche request (after long sute and peticion) to theim was hardely
graunted. The Erle like a valiaunt capitain, entred into the toune and
there appoynted for gouernors, the lorde Roos, and the lorde Talbot,
and leuyng there a conuenient garrison, returned to the lorde Regent.
               
                  AFTER the takyng of this toune, there was a league, and a treaty
concluded betwene the Regent and the duke of Britayn, by the whiche
agrement bothe the tounes of Pountorson and. S. Iames de Beuron
wer beaten doune to the ground &amp; clery defaced. After the lord of Rais
was departed out of the territory of Mayne as you haue heard, Christopher
Hanson, Phillip Gough, Martyn Godffrey called the scaler,
and diuerse other of the garrison of. S. Susan, to the nombre of .xxx.
archars, went out in a mornyng to seke their aduētures, and came nere
to the Castle of sainct Laurence de Mortiers (at thesame very season)
whē sir Iames de Sepeaulx capitain of thesame, was gone out of his
Castle with the greatest nombre of his retinewe, to a Churche directly
against the castle. In the masse time, thenglishmen entered by subtiltie
into the gate &amp; so gat the dongeon. And when sir Iames returned from
Masse, as he entered into the gate he was taken, and his men fled, and

so was the castle furnished with Englishmen, and capitain therof was
appoynted, sir William Oldhaule.
               
                  THE same season, sir Ihon Fastolfe, gouernor of the countries of
Aniow and Maine, assembled a great puissaunce of men of warre, and
laied a siege before the castle of sainct Owen Destays, beside the toune
of Lauall, wherof was capitain sir Guillam Orenge, whiche, after ten
daies besiegyng, rendred the castle, their liues and armure only except:
howbeit one railyng and slaunderous persone was put to terrible execucion.
And from thence, thesaid sir Ihon remoued to the strōg castle of
Grauile, &amp; after .xii. daies, thei within offred to yeld the castle by a daie
if thei wer not succored by y• dolphin or his power. The offre was taken
&amp; pledges deliuered, which wer Guillā Cordouen, &amp; Ihon de Maisierie
esquiers. After these pledges deliuered, sir Ihon Fastolffe returned in
post to the regent, aduertisyng him of this composicion and agrement:
wherfore thesaid lorde, reised a greate power, to fight with the Frenche
men at the daie appoynted, and in his company, wer the erles of Mor
                  
                     •
                  aigne
and Warwicke, and the lordes Roos, and Talbot, sir Ihon Fastolffe,
sir Ihon Aubemond, sir Ihon Ratelife, and diuerse other, to the
nombre of twentie thousande men, and so marched forwarde in hope to
mete and ioyne battail with their enemies. But their aduersaries, whiche
wer not farre of, durste not approche, wherefore the Regent sent sir
Ihon Falstolffe incontinent to receiue the castle: but thei within (cōtrary
to their promesse and appointment) had newly vitailed and manned
the place, and so forsaking their pledges and felowes in armes, refused
to render the fortres accordyng to the appointment: wherfore the pledges
were brought before the sight of theim within the castle, and there
openly put to death. After this, the lorde Talbot, was made gouernor,
of Aniow and Mayne, and sir Ihon Fastolffe was assigned to another
place: whiche lorde Talbot, beyng bothe of noble birthe, and haute corage,
after his comming into Fraunce, obteined so many glorious victories
of his enemies, that his only name was, and yet is dredful to the
Frenche nacion, and muche renoumed emongest al other people. This
ioly capitain, and sonne of the valiant Mars, entered into Mayn and
slewe men, destroyed castles, and brent tounes, and in conclusion, sodainly
toke the toune of Lauall: but the lorde Loghac, and diuerse other,
retrayted theim selfes into the Castle, and there remained eight daies.
Duryng which tyme, it was agreed, that al capitaines, Burgesses, and
men of warre, whiche wer within the Castle, should depart with bagge
and baggages, paiyng to the lord Talbot for al thynges, one hundred
thousand Crounes. And the Castle so beyng deliuered, was committed
to the kepyng of Gilbert Halsall, whiche after, was slain at the siege of
Orleance, for whom was made capitain Matthew Gough, whiche beyng
at the iorney before Senlies, by treason of a miller that kept a mil
adioynyng to the walle, the Frenchemen entered into the toune, and
brought it into their subieccion and obeysaunce.
               
                  
                  THE duke of Bedford, was aduertised by his espials, that the toune
of Montarges, whiche was in the territory of Orleance, was but slenderly
kept and smally furnished, and that it might bee taken with litle
pain and no losse. The Regent glad of these newes, sent therle of Suffolke,
sir Ihon Pole his brother, &amp; sir Henry Bisset, with sixe .M. men
to assaute the toune, but when thei came thether and founde the toune
better manned and more strongly defenced, then their expectacion imagined,
thei gaue no assaute but laied siege aboute the toune, and therle
of Warwicke was appoynted to lye with a greate nomber of menne of
warre, at sainct Mathelines de Archamp, to encountre the Frenchmen
if thei would attempt to ayde or vitaill those that wer enclosed within
the toune. This fortresse stode in suche a place, that what with waters
and what with marishes, the army must seuer in thre partes, so that the
one could not easely helpe the other, but either by boates or bridges, so
the toune was besieged by the space of two monethes and more. In the
meane season, Arthur of Britayne, Constable for the dolphyn, sent thether
in all hast, the lorde Boisac Marshall of Fraūce, Stephin le Hire,
Ponton de Sentrayles, the lorde Grauile, and diuerse other valiaunt
horssemen, to the nomber of thre thousand and aboue, whiche priuily in
the night, came on that side where sir Ihon de la Pole and sir Henry
Bisset laye, whom thei founde out of al ordre and without any watche.
So the Frenchemen entered into their lodges and slewe many in their
beddes, thei spared no man, for the resistance was smal. Sir Ihō Delapole
with his horsse saued hymself, and fled ouer the water to his brother,
&amp; sir Henry Bisset escaped by a boate and eight with hym. The residue
whiche would haue passed the bridge and ioyned with the erle of
Suffolke, fled in suche plumpes ouer the bridge, that the tymber brake
and a great nombre was drouned so, ye there wer slain &amp; drouned .xv.C
men. The erle of Warwicke hearyng of this chaunce, departed from
sainct Mathelyn with all diligent spede, and came before Montarges
offeryng battaill to the Frenche capitaines, whiche answered that thei
had manned and vitailed the toune, and entēded to do nomore at that
time. Thenglishmen seyng that their trauaile should bee in vain, came
backe softely again with all their ordinaunce to the duke of Bedforde.
               
                  IT should seme that fortune at this time would not, that the Frēche
men should haue one ioyfull daie, but thesame also should be myngled
with dolor or displeasure. For at this very tyme, sir Nicholas Burdett
appoynted by the duke of Somerset, to vexe and trouble his enemies
in the costes of Britayne, sent light horssemen into euery part, vexyng
the people and wastyng the coūtrey. All tounes that he passed by
were brente, al and buildynges spoyled &amp; robbed, prisoners and praies
wer aboundantly taken, smal villages wer destroyed and, greate tounes
wer raunsomed, &amp; so without hurt or damage, thesaid sir Nicholas
returned into Normandy. This mischance beyng declared to the Constable
of Fraunce and the other capitaines, cut their combes and plucked

doune their hartes, whiche were set on so mery a pynne, for the victory
of Montarges, that thei were in maner, like desperate persones,
lothe to attempte any fa
                     •
                  ther enterprise against the Englishe nacion,
saiyng: that God was turned Englishe, and the deuill would not helpe
Fraunce.
               
                  THE duke of Alaūson, whiche as you haue hard, was late deliuered
out of Englande, reuiued again the dull spirites of the Dolphyn, and
the fainte hartes of his capitaines, promisyng to theim greate victory
with litle trauail, and muche gain with smal labor, wherfore in hope of
good lucke, he determined to do some notable feate against thenglishe
men. Then happened a chaunce vnloked for, or vnthought of, euen as
thei would haue whisshed or desired, for not onely the Magistrates,
but chiefly the spiritual persons of the citee of Mauns, knowyng that
the duke of Britayne and his brother, were reuerted and turned to the
Frenche partie, began sore to mourne and lament that thei wer subiectes
and vassals to the yoke and power of the Englishemen. Wherfore
thei determined and fully concluded, to aduertise of their myndes and
determinacions, the capitaines of Charles y• dolphyn, (of thē called the
Frenche kyng) and so by certain false Friers, therof wrote humble and
louing letters. These newes pleased muche the French capitaines, but
no lesse you maie bee sure the Dolphyn hymself, as a thyng discended
from heauen, of theim vnsought, vnimagined and not deuised. Wherfore
to take oportunitie when time serued, and not to lese so great a benefite
so honestly offred, the lordes Delabreth and Fayet, Marshals of
Fraunce, accompanied with the lordes of Monte Ihan, of Bu
                     •
                  l Doruall,
Torsye and Beaumamoyre the Heire, and Gullyam his brother,
and fiue hundred other hardy capitaines and valiaunt souldiers, toke
vpon theim this enterprise, sendyng greate thankes and laudes to the
Clergie and citezens, for their assured ridelitie to their soueraigne lord,
promysyng theim to bee there at the daie appoynted, not doubtyng to
find them redy accordyng to their promes, gladly to receiue them.
               
                  VVHEN the daie assigned and the night appoynted was come, the
Frenche capitaines priuely approched the toune, makyng a litle fire
on an hill in the sight of the toune, to signifie their cōmyng and approchyng.
The citezēs, whiche by the great church wer loking for their approch,
shewed a burnyng Cresset out of the steple, whiche sodainly was
put out &amp; quenched. What should I saie, the capitaines in horssebacke
came to the gate, and the traytors within slewe the porters and watche
men, and let in their frendes, the footemen entered firste, and the men of
armes waited at the barriers, to the intent that if muche nede required
or necessitie cōpelled, their might fight in the opē feld. And in the meane
season many Englishmen wer slain, and a greate claymor and a houge
noyse was hard through the toune, as is wont and accustomed to be in
a toune, by treason sodainly surprised &amp; taken: but what was the cause
of the cry, or beginnyng of the noyse, fewe except the confederates, ether

knewe or perceiued. For the remnaunt of the citezens beyng no partakers
in this faccion, imagined that the Englshmen had made hauocke
in the toune and put all to the sweard. The Englishemen on the othersyde,
iudged that the citezens had begonne some new rebellion against
theim, or els had striuen emongest theimselfes. The erle of Suffolke,
whiche was gouernour of the toune, hearyng the clamor and noyse of
the people, hauyng perfect knowledge of suche as escaped frō the walles,
in what case the citee stode in, without any tariyng or prolongyng
of tyme, entered into the Castle whiche standeth at the gate of Sainct
Uincent, wherof was Constable Thomas G
                     •
                  wer esquier: whether also
fled so many Englishemen, that the place was pestured, and there if
thei wer not rescued, likely to be famished: but surely thei were sore assauted
and marueilously hurte, with the shot of the alablasters &amp; crosse
bowes, but thei defended theimselfes so manfully, that their enemies
gat small aduauntage at their handes. But all their hardines had not
serued, nor all their pollicy had not defended theim, if thei had not priuely
sent a messenger to the lorde Talbot, whiche then laie at Alanson,
certefiyng hym in what case thei stoode, for vitaill had thei none, municiōs
failed, and the Castle was almoste vndermined, so that yeldyng
must folowe, and resistaunce could not preuaile. The lorde Talbot heryng
these newes, neither stept nor banquetted, but with all hast assembled
together his valiaunt capitaines, whose names you haue before
often times heard rehersed, to the nombre of vii. hundred men of warr,
and in the euenyng departed from Alanson, and in the mornyng came
to a castle called Guyerche twoo myles from Mauns, and from thence
sent as an espial Matthew Gough, to espie the gouernance of the enemies,
and if he might to shewe to his countreymen that he was at hāde
to be their aide &amp; rescowes. Matthew Gough so well sped, that priuely
in the night he came into the castle, where he knew how that the French
men beyng lordes of the citee, and now castyng no perels nor fearyng
any creature, began to waxe wanton and fell to riote, as though their
enemies could do to them no damage: thynkyng that the Englishemen
whiche wer shutte vp in the Castle, studied nothyng but how to escape
and be deliuered. Whē Matthew Gough had knowen al the certaintie
and had eaten a litle breade and dronke a cuppe of wine to comfort his
stomacke, he priuely returned again, and within a mile of the citee met
with the lorde Talbot and the Lorde Scales, and made open to theim
al thyng according to his credence, whiche to spede the matter, because
the daie approched, with al hast possible came to the posterne gate, and
alighted from their horses, and about sixe of the clocke in the mornyng
thei issued out of the castle criyng sainct George, Talbot. The French
men whiche wer scace vp, and thought of nothyng lesse then of this sodain
approchment, some rose out of their beddes in their shertes, and
lepte ouer the walles, other ranne naked out of the gates for sauyng
of their liues, leuyng behynde theim all their apparell, horsses, armure

and riches, none was hurt but suche, whiche ether resisted or would not
yelde, wherof some were slain and cast in prisone. There were slain and
taken foure hundred gētlemen and the villaines frankely let go. After
this, inquisicion was made of the authors of this vngracious coniuracion,
and there wer accused thirtie citezens, twenty priestes and fiftene
Friers, whiche accordyng to their desertes were put in execucion.
            
            
               ¶The sixt yere.The .vi. yere.
               
               
                  THE citee of Mauns thus beyng reduced into the Englishe
mennes handes, the Lorde Talbot departed to
the toune of Alanson. After whiche marciall feat manly
acheued, the erle of Warwicke departed into Enlande,
to bee gouernor of the young kyng, in steade of
Thomas duke of Excester, late departed to God. In
whose stede was sent into Fraunce, the lorde Thomas
Mountacute erle of Salisbury with fiue thousande men, whiche landed
at Calice and so came to the Duke of Bedford in Paris. Where he
consultyng with the duke of Bedforde, concernyng the affaires of the
realme of Fraunce: seyng all thynges prosperously succede on the Englishe
part, began meruailously to phantelic the citee and countrey of
Orliance, stādyng on the riuer of Loyre. But because the cite was well
fortified bothe by the nature of the situaciō of the place, and by the pollicie
of man, he imagined it not the woorke of one daie, nor the study of
one houre. Wherfore he remitted it to a farther deliberaciō, yet he was
the man at that tyme, by whose wit, strength and pollicie, the Englishe
name was muche fearfull and terrible to the French nacion, whiche of
hymself might bothe appoynt, commaunde and do all thynges, in maner
at his pleasure, in whose power, (as it appeared after his deathe) a
greate part of the conquest consisted and was estemed, because he was
a man bothe painful and diligent, redy to withstand thynges perilous
and imminent, and prompt in counsail, and with no labor be weried, nor
yet his corage at any tyme abated or appalled, so that all men put no
more trust in any one man, nor no synguler person gat more the hartes
of all men. After this greate enterprise, had long been debated and argued,
in the priuie counsaill, the erle of Salisburies deuise, (although
it semed harde and straunge to all other, and to hym as it wer a thyng
predestinate very easie) was graunted and allowed, whiche enterprise
was the final conclusion of his naturall destiny; as you shall shortely
perceiue. Thus he replenished with good hope of victory, &amp; furnished
with artilery, and municions apperteinyng to so greate a siege, accompanied
with the erle of Suffolke and the lorde Talbot, and with a valiaunt
company, to the nombre of tenne thousande men, departed from
Paris and passed through the countrey of Beause. He toke by assaute
the toune of Yainuile, but the Frenchmen fled into the Castle, and there
continued fiue daies, at the ende wherof thei rendered themselfes symply:

of thesaid nombre, some wer put to death for certain causes, &amp; some
were taken to mercie. He tooke also the toune of Bawgency, sufferyng
euery man, whiche would become vassaile and subiecte to the Kyng of
England, to enherite their landes and enioy their goodes. The tounes
of Meun vpon Loyre &amp; Iargenan, hearyng of these treatise, presented
to hym the keyes of the toune, vpon like agrement &amp; egall condicions.
               
                  AFTER this in the moneth of Septembre, he laied his siege on the
one side of the water of Loyre, before whose commyng, the Bastarde of
Orleaunce, and the bishop of the citee and a great nombre of Scottes,
hearyng of therles intent, made diuerse fortificacions about the toune
and destroyed the suburbes, in the whiche wer twelfe parishe churches
and foure ordres of Friers. Thei cut also doune al the vines, trees and
bushes within fiue leages of the toune, so that the Englishmen should
haue neither comfort, refuge nor succor.
               
                  HERE must I a litle digresse, and declare to you, what was this bastard
of Orleance, whiche was not onely now capitain of the citee, but
also after, by Charles the sixt made erle of Dunoys, and in greate authoritie
in Fraunce, and extreme enemie to the Englishe nacion, as by
this story you shall apparauntly perceiue, of whose line and steme dyscend
the Dukes of Longuile and the Marques of Rutylon. Lewes
Duke of Orleance murthered in Paris, by Ihon duke of Burgoyne,
as you before haue harde, was owner of the Castle of Concy, on the
Frontiers of Fraunce toward Arthoys, wherof he made Constable the
lord of Cauny, a man not so wise as his wife was faire, and yet she was
not so faire, but she was as well beloued of the duke of Orleance, as of
her husband. Betwene the duke and her husbande (I cannot tell who
was father) she conceiued a child, and brought furthe a prety boye called
Ihon, whiche child beyng of the age of one yere, the duke disceased
and not long after the mother, and the Lorde of Cawny ended their liues.
The next of kynne to the lord Cawny chalenged the enheritaunce,
whiche was worth foure thousande crounes a yere, alledgyng that the
boye was a bastard: and the kynred of the mothers side, for to saue her
honesty, it plainly denied. In conclusion, this matter was in contenciō
before the Presidentes of the parliament of Paris, and there hang in
controuersie till the child came to the age of eight yeres old. At whiche
tyme it was demaunded of hym openly whose sonne he was: his frēdes
of his mothers side aduertised hym to require a day, to be aduised of so
great an answer, whiche he asked, &amp; to hym it was graūted. In y• meane

                     •
                  eason his said frendes persuaded hym to claime his inheritaunce, as
sonne to the Lorde of Cawny, whiche was an honorable liuyng, and an
aunciēt patrimony, affirming that if he said contrary, he not only slaū
                  dered
his mother, shamed hymself, &amp; stained his bloud, but also should
haue no liuyng nor any thing to take to. The scholemaster thinkyng y•
his disciple had wel learned his lesson, and would reherse it accordyng
to his instrucciō, brought hym before the Iudges at the daie assigned,

and when the question was repeted to hym again, he boldly answered,
my harte geueth me, &amp; my noble corage telleth me, that I am the sonne
of the noble Duke of Orleaunce, more glad to be his Bastrde, with a
meane liuyng, then the lawfull sonne of that coward cuckolde Cauny,
with his foure thousande crounes. The Iustices muche merueiled at
his bolde answere, and his mothers cosyns detested hym for shamyng
of his mother, and his fathers supposed kinne reioysed in gainyng the
patrimony and possessions. Charles duke of Orleance heryng of this
iudgement, toke hym into his family &amp; gaue hym greate offices &amp; fees,
whiche he well deserued, for (duryng his captiuitie) he defēded his lā
                  des,
expulsed thenglishmen, &amp; in conclusion procured his deliueraunce.
               
                  THIS coragious Bastard, after the siege had continued thre wekes
ful, issued out of the gate of the bridge, and fought with the Englishemen,
but thei receiued hym with so 
                     •
                  ierce and terrible strokes, that he
was with all his company compelled to retire and flie backe into the
citee: but the Englishemen folowed theim so faste, in killyng and takyng
of their enemies, that thei entred with them the Bulwarke of the
bridge, whiche with a greate toure, standing at thende of thesame, was
taken incontinent by thenglishmen. In whiche conflict many Frenche
men were taken, but mo were slain, and the kepyng of the toure and
Bulwerke was cōmitted to William Glasdale esquier. When he had
gotten this Bulwarke, he was sure that, by that waie neither man nor
vitaill could passe or come. After that, he made certayne Bulwarkes
roūde about the citee, castyng trenches betwene the one and the other,
laiyng ordinaunce in euery part, where he saw that any battery might
be deuised. When thei within perceiued that thei were enuironed with
fortresses and ordinance, thei laied gonne against gonne, and fortefied
toures against bulwarkes, and within made new rampires, and buylded
newe mudwalles to auoyde crackes and breches, whiche might by
violent shot sodainly insue. Thei appoynted the Bastard of Orleance,
and Stephin Ueignold called the Heire, to se the walles and watches
kept, &amp; the bishop sawe y• thinhabitātes within the cite: wer put in good
ordre, and that vitaill wer not wantonly consumed, nor vainly spent.
               
                  IN the toure that was taken at the bridge ende, as you before haue
heard, there was a high chamber hauyng a grate full of barres of yron
by the whiche a man might loke al the length of the bridge into the cite
at which, grate many of the chief capitaines stode diuerse times, vieuyng
the cite &amp; deuisyng in what place it was best assautable. Thei with
in the citee perceiued well this totyng hole, and laied a pece of ordynaunce
directly against the wyndowe. It so chaunced that the .lix. daie
after the siege laied before the citee, therle of Salisbury, sir Thomas
Gargraue and William Glasdale and diuerse other, went into thesaid
toure and so into the high chābre, and loked out at the grate, and with
in a short space, the sonne of the Master gonner, perceiued men lokyng
out at the wyndowe, tooke his matche, as his father had taught hym,

whiche was gone doune to dinner, and fired the gonne, whiche brake &amp;
sheuered ye yron barres of the grate, wherof, one strake therle so strōgly
on the hed, that it stroke away one of his iyes and the side of his cheke.
Sir Thomas Gargraue was likewise striken, so that he died within
two daies. Therle was conueyed to Meum vpon Loyre, where he laie
beyng wounded .viij. daies, duryng whiche tyme, he receiued deuoutly
the holy Sacramentes, and so commended his soule to almighty God,
whose body was conueyed into England, with al funerall and pompe,
and buried at Bissam by his progenitors, leuyng behind hym, an onely
daughter named Alice, maried to Richarde Neuell, sonne to Raufe
erle of Westmerland, of whom hereafter shalbe made mencion. What
detriment, what damage, what losse succeded to the Englishe publique
wealthe, by the sodain death of this valiaunt capitain, not long after
his departure, manifestly apered. For high prosperttie, and great glory
of the Englishe nacion in the parties beyond the sea, began shortely
to fall, and litle and litle to vanishe awaie: whiche thyng, although the
Englishe people like a valiant &amp; strong body, at the firste tyme did not
perceiue, yet after ye thei felt it grow like a pestilēt humor, which succesciuely
alitle and litle corrupteth all the membres, and destroyeth the
body. For, after the death of this noble man, fortune of warre began to
change, and triumphant victory began to be darckened. Although the
death of therle wer dolorous to all Englishmē, yet surely it was moste
dolorous to the duke of Bedford, regent of Fraunce, as he whiche had
loste his right hande or lacked his weapon, when he should fight with
his enemie. But seyng that dedde men cannot with sorowe be called again,
nor lamentacion for dedde bodies cannot remedy the chaunces of
men liuyng: he (like a prudent gouernor &amp; a pollitique patron,) appointed
therle of Suffolke to be his leuetenaunt, and capitain of the siege,
and ioyned with hym the lorde Scales, the lorde Talbot, sir Ihon Fastolfe,
and diuerse other valiaunt knightes and esquiers. These lordes
caused bastiles to be made rounde about the citee, with the whiche thei
troubled their enemies and assauted the walles, and left nothyng vnattempted,
whiche might bee to theim, any aduantage, or hurtefull to
their enemies.
               
                  IN the time of lent, vitaile and artillerie, began to waxe scant in the
Englishe armie, wherfore therle of Suffolke appoynted sir Ihon Fastolfe,
sir Thomas Rampstō, and sir Phillip Hal with their retinewes,
to ride to Paris to the lorde Regent, to informe hym of their scarsenes
and necessitie. Whiche beyng therof informed, without any delaye or
prolongyng, prouided vitaile, artillery and municions, necessary and
conuenient for so greate an enterprise, and laded therwith many chariottes,
cartes, and horsses, and for the 
                     •
                  ure cōduite, and sauegard of the
same, he appoynted sir Simon Morhier Prouost of Paris, with the
gard of the citee &amp; diuerse of his awne houshold seruauntes, to accompany
sir Ihon Fastolfe and his cōplices, to the army liyng at the siege

or Orleaunce. The whiche departed in good ordre, to the nombre of .v.
hundred men of warre, beside wagoners out of Paris, and came to Yaynuile
in Beausse, and in a mornyng early in a greate frost thei departed,
from the place toward the siege, and when thei came to a toune called
Ronuray, in the laūdes of Beausse, thei perceiued their enemies cō
                  myng
against them, to the nombre of .ix. or .x.M. Frenchemen &amp; Scottes:
the capitaines wherof was Charles of Cleremōt, sonne to the duke
of Burbon, then beyng prisoner in Englande, sir William Stewarde
Constable of Scotlande, alitle before deliuered out of captiuitie, the
erle of Pedriacke, the lorde Ihon Uandosme, Uidane of Charters, the
Lorde of Touars, the lorde of Lohat, the lorde of Eglere, the Lorde of
Beaniew, the Bastard Tremorle, and many other valiant capitaines.
Wherfore sir Ihon Fastolfe and his companions, set all their company
in good ordre of battaill, and picked stakes before euery Archer, to
breke the force of the horsemen. At their backes thei set all their wagōs
and cariages, and within theim thei tied all their horsses, so that their
enemies could nether assaile them on the backeside, nor yet spoile them
of their horsses, and in this maner thei stode stil, abidyng the assaute of
their aduersaries. The Frenchemen (by reason of their greate nombre)
thinkyng the victory to be in their handes, egerly like Lions set on the
Englishemen, whiche with greate force, theim receiued and manfully
defended: for it stoode theim vpon, consideryng the inequalitie of the
nombre. And after long and cruell fight, the Englishmen droue backe
and vanquished the proude Frenchemen, and compelled theim to flie.
In this conflicte were slain, Lorde Willyam Stewarde Constable of
Scotlande and his brother, the lorde Doruall, the lorde Delabret, the
lorde Chasteanbrian, sir Ihon Basgot, and other Frenchemen &amp; Scottes,
to the nomber of .xxv.C. and aboue .xj. hundred taken prisoners,
although some Frenche writers affirme the nombre lesse.
               
                  AFTER this fortunate victory, sir Ihon Fastolfe and his company
(of the whiche no man of any reputacion was either slain or taken,)
came with all their cariages, vitaile, and prisoners, to the siege before
Orleance, where thei wer ioyously receiued &amp; welcomed of all the souldiors.
This conflict (because the most part of the cariage was heryng &amp;
leuten stuffe,) the Frenchmen cal, the vnfortunate battail of herynges.
               
                  THE Erle of Suffolke, beeyng thus vitailed, continued his
siege, and euery daie almoste, skirmished with his enemies, whiche, beyng
in dispaire of all succors, began to cōmen emongest theimself, how
thei might rendre the toune, to their moste honoure and profite. After
muche reasonyng, and long debatyng emongest the capitaines, and
the magistrates of the toune, what way was best to be folowed: Some
affirmed it not onely to be shamefull and dishonorable, but also vnnaturall
and vnreasonable, to yelde the toune to the Englishemen, beyng
neither frendes nor fauorers of the Frenche nacion: other, fearyng the
victory of the Englishmen, imagined, that if thei by force possessed the

citee, thei would do to them as tyrantes be accustomed to serue, wilfull
and obstinate people, and therefore thei thought it a greate folye and a
notable lightnes, not to beware the one, as to deny or refuse the other.
But when thei saw, that their glory must nedes decline to a shame &amp; reproche,
thei thought to find a meane waye to saue themselfes, and their
cite frō the captiuitie of their enemies, and deuised to submit their citee
thēselfes, &amp; al theirs vnder the obeysance of Phillip duke of Burgoyn
because he was brought out of the stocke and bloud royall of the auncient
hous of Fraunce: thinkyng by this meanes (as thei did in deede)
to breke or minishe the greate amitie betwene the Englishemen &amp; hym.
               
                  AFTER this poynt concluded, thei made open &amp; sent to the duke al
their deuises and intentes, whiche certified thē that he would gladly receiue
their offre, so that the Regent of Fraunce would therto agre &amp; cō
                  sent.
And therupō dispatched certain ambassadors to the duke of Bedford,
to whom these newes wer straunge and not very pleasaunt, vpon
whiche poynt, he assembled a great counsaill. Some thought that maner
of yeldyng to be bothe honorable and profitable to the king of Englande,
by reason wherof, so greate a citee, &amp; so riche a countrey, should
be brought out of the possessiō of their enemies, into the hādes of their
trusty frendes, without farther cost or bloudshed. The Duke of Bedford
&amp; other, wer of a contrary opinion, thinkyng it bothe dishonorable
and vnprofitable to the realme of England, to se a cite so long besieged
at the costes &amp; expenses of the kyng of England, &amp; almoste brought to
the poynt of yeldyng, to be yelded to any other forē prince or potestate,
and not to hym or his Regent, the exāple wherof might prouoke other
tounes herfater to do the
                     •
                  ame. This reason toke place, and the Regent
answered the dukes ambassadors, that it was not honorable nor yet cō
                  sonaunte
to reason, that the kyng of Englande should beate the bushe
and the duke of Burgoyne should haue the birdes: Wherfore sithe the
right was his, the war was his, and the charge was his, he saied that y•
citie ought not to be yelded to no other person, but to hym or to his vse
and profite. By this litle chance, succeded a great change in thenglishe
affaires, for a double mischief of this answere rose and prangout. For
first the duke of Burgoyne, began to conceiue a certain priuye grudge
against thenglishmen for this cause: thynkyng thē to enuy &amp; beare malice
against his glory and profite, for the whiche in continuance of time
he became their enemy, and 
                     •
                  leued to the Frenche Kyng. Secondly, the
Englishemen lefte the siege of Orleaunce, whiche by this treaty thei
might haue had to frend, or to haue continued neutre, till their Lorde
the duke of Orleaunce, or the erle of Angulosie his brother wer deliue
red out of the captiuitie of the English people. But if men wer angels
and for
                     •
                  aw thynges to come, thei like beastes would not ronne to their
confusion: but fortune whiche gideth the destiny of man, will turne her
whele as she listeth, who soeuer saith nay.
               
                  VVHILE this treaty of the Orleaunces was in hand, Charles the

dolphin, daily studied and hourly labored, to plucke the fauor and hartes
of the nobilitie of Fraunce, from the Englishe nacion, to the intent,
that he might assemble a puyssance, sufficient to relefe his frendes, beyng
shut vp in the citie of Orleaūce. While he was studiyng and compassyng
this matter, there happened to hym, a straunge chaunce, of the
whiche I will write alitle, because some of the Frenche aucthours, and
especially, Ihon Bouchet, of it writeth to muche.
               
                  FOR as he and other saie, there came to hym beyng at Chynon, a
mayd of the age of .xx. yeres, and in mans apparell, named Ione, borne
in Burgoyne in a toune called Droymy beside Uancolour, which was
a greate space a cham
                     •
                  erleyn in a commen hostrey, and was a rampe of
suche boldnesse, that she would course horses and ride theim to water,
and do thynges, that other yong maidens, bothe abhorred &amp; wer ashamed
to do: yet as some say, whether it wer because of her foule face, that
no man would desire it, either she had made a vowe to liue chaste, she
kept her maydenhed, and preserued her virginitie. She (as a monster)
was sent to the Dolphin, by sir Robert Bandrencort capitain of Uancolour,
to whō she declared, that she was sent frō God, bothe to aide the
miserable citee of Orleaunce, and also to remit hym, to the possession of
his realme, out of the whiche, he was expulsed and ouercomed: rehersyng
to hym, visions, traūses, and fables, full of blasphemy, supersticiō
and hypocrisy, that I maruell muche that wise men did beleue her, and
lerned clarkes would write suche phantasies. What should I reherse,
how thei saie, she knewe and called hym her kyng, whom she neuer saw
before. What should I speake how she had by reuelacion a swerde, to
her appoynted in the churche of saincte Katheryn, of Fierboys in Torayne
where she neuer had been. What should I write, how she declared
suche priuy messasges from God, our lady, and other sainctes, to the
dolphyn, that she made the teres ronne doune frō his iyes. So was he
deluded, so was he blynded, &amp; so was he deceiued by the deuils meanes
whiche suffred her to begynne her race, and inconclusion rewarded her
with a shamefull fal. But in the meane season suche credite was geuen
to her, that she was honoured as a sainct, of the religious, and beleued
as one sent from God of the temporaltie, in so muche that she (armed at
all poyntes) rode from Poytiers to Bloys, and ther found men of war
vitail, and municions, redy to be conueyed to Orleaūce. The Englishmen
perceiuyng that thei within could not long continue, for faute of
vitaile &amp; pouder, kepte not their watche so diligently as thei wer accustomed,
nor scoured not the coūtrey enuironed, as thei before had ordained;
whiche negligence, the citezens shut in perceiuing, sent worde therof
to the Frenche capitaines, whiche with Pucelle in the dedde tyme of
the night, and in a greate rayne and thundre, with all their vitaile and
artilery entered into the citee, if thei were welcomed marueill not. For
folkes in greate trouble, be ioyous of a litle comfort. And the next daie
the Englishemen boldely assauted the toune, promisyng to theim that

best scaled the walles great rewardes. Then men mounted on ladders
coragiously, and with gonnes, arrowes and pikes, bette their enemies
from the walles.
               
                  THE Frenchemen, although thei marueiled at the fierce fightyng
of the English people, yet thei wer not amased, but thei defended theim
selfes to the darke night, on whiche daie, no great priuate feate worthy
of memory, was either attempted or doen. The Bastard of Orleaunce
(seyng the puyssaunce of thenglishe nacion) began to feare the sequele
of the matter: wherfore he sent worde to the duke of Alaunson, aduertisyng
hym in what case the toune then stoode, and that it could not long
continue without his hasty spede, and quicke diligence. Whiche delaiyng
no tyme nor deferryng no space, came with al his army within two
leagues of the citee, and sent woorde to the capitaines, that on the next
morowe thei should be redy to receiue theim. Whiche thyng, the nexte
daie thei accomplished, for the Englishemen thought it to be muche to
their auaile, if so greate a multitude entered into the citee, vexed with
famyne &amp; replenished with scarsenes. On the next daie in the mornyng,
the Frenchemen alt
                     •
                  gether issued out of the toune, and assauted the
fortresse or Bastile, called the Bastyle of sainct Loure, the whiche with
great force and no litle losse thei toke and set it on fire, and after assauted
the toure at the bridge foote, whiche was manfully defended. But
the Frenchemen beyng more in nombre, so fiersely assauted it, that thei
toke it or the Lorde Talbot could come to succors: in the whiche Willyam
Gladdisdale the capitain was slain, and the Lorde Morlyns, and
the lorde Pownynges also.
               
                  THE Frenchemen puffed vp with this good lucke, seyng the strong
fortres was vngotten, whiche was vnder the defence of the lorde Talbot,
fetched a compasse aboute, and in good ordre of battaile marched
thether ward. The lorde Talbot like a capitain, without feare or dred
of so great a multitude, issued out of his Bastile, and so fier
                     ••
                  y fought
with the Frenchemen, that thei not able to withstande his puyssaunce,
fled (like shepe before the Wolffe) again into the citee, with greate losse
of men and small artilerie: and of the Englishemen wer lost in the two
Bastyles sixe hundred presones. Then the erle of Suffolke, the Lorde
Tolbot, the Lorde Scales, and other capitaines, assembled together,
where causes wer shewed, that it was bothe necessary and conueniente
either to leue the siege for euer, or to deferre it till another tyme, more
luckey &amp; conueninet. And to the intent that thei should not seme either
to flie or to bee driuen from the siege by their enemies, thei determined
to leaue their fortresses and Bastyles, and to assemble in the plain feld
and there to abyde all the daie, abidyng the outcommyng and battaile
of their enemies. This conclusion taken, was accordyngly executed.
The Frenchemen, weried with the last bickeryng, held in their heddes
and durste not once appere: and so thei set fire in their lodgynges, and
departed in good ordre of battail from Orleaunce. The next daie whiche

was the .viij. daie of Maie, the Erle of Suffolke, ridyng to Iargeaux
with .CCCC. Englishemen, and the lorde Talbot with another
cōpany returned to Meum. Whiche toune, after that he had fortified,
he incontinent, assauted and wan the toune of Lauall and the Castle,
sore vexyng and punishyng the tounes men, for their hard hartes, and
cancard obstinacie: and leauyng there a garrison, reculed to Meum.
               
                  AFTER this siege thus broken vp, to tel you, what triumphes wer
made in the citee of Orleaunce, what wood was spente in fiers, what
wyne was dronke in houses, what songes wer song in the stretes, what
melody was made in Tauernes, what roundes were daunced in large
and brode places, what lightes wer set vp in the churches, what anthemes,
wer song in Chapelles, and what ioye was shewed in euery place,
it were a long woorke and yet no necessary cause. For thei did, as we in
like case would haue dooen, and we beeyng in like estate, would haue
doen as thei did. After that the Englishmen, wer thus retired from the
siege of Orleaunce, and seuered themselfes in diuerse tounes &amp; fortresses,
holdyng on their part: The duke of Alaunson, the Bastard of Orleaunce,
Ione the puzell, the lorde of Gancort, &amp; diuerse other Frenche
men, came before the toune of Iargeaux, where the Erle of Suffolke
and his twoo brethren soiorned the .xij. daie of Iune, and gaue to the
toune a great and a terrible assaut, whiche the Englishmen, (beyng but
a handfull) manfully defended on three partes of thesame. Poyton of
Sentrailes, perceiuyng one part of the toune to be vndefended, scaled
the walles on that part: and without any difficulte toke the toune, and
slewe sir Alexander Pole brother to therle, and many other, to the nombre
of two hundred: but thei not muche gayned, for thei lost .iii.C. good
men and more. Of thenglishmen wer taken .xl. beside his brother Ihō.
After this gain and good lucke, the Frenchemen returnyng towarde
Orleaunce, fell in contencion and debate, for their captiues and prisoners,
and slewe them all, sauyng the erle and his brother.

                  AFter the gaynyng of the toune of Iargeaux, thesame
army cam to Meum, and toke the toure at the bridge,
and put there in a garrison, and frō thence remoued to
Bangency. Whiche garrison, beyng not vitailed rendered
the toune, so that thei might departe with bagge
and baggage, frankely and frely: whiche desire to thē
was graunted. At this toune of Bangency, met with
the duke of Alaunson, Arthur of Britayne the false forsworne gentleman
to the kyng of Englande, newly made Constable of Fraunce (as
you haue heard,) with whom was the lorde Delabret with .xij.C. men:
to whom daily repaired freshe aide out of euery parte, as the Erle of
Uandosme, and other, to the nombre of .xx. or .xxiij.M. men. All these
men of warre, determined to go to Meum, and to take the toune, but

thei wer informed, that the Englishemen, had lefte the toune desolate,
and wer returned to the lord Talbot to Ieneuile. Then thei concluded
to passe towarde that toune. But, as thei marched forwarde vpon a
Saterdaie, thei had perfite knowledge, that the lorde Talbot with .v.
thousand men, was commyng to Meum. Wherfore, thei intendyng to
stop hym a tyde, conueyed their company to a small village called Patay,
whiche way, thei knewe that the Englishmen must nedes passe by.
And first thei appoynted their horsemen, whiche were well and richely
furnished, to go before, and sodainly to set on the Englishemen, or thei
wer, either ware or set in ordre. The Englishmen commyng forwarde,
perceiued the horsemen, and, unaginyng to deceiue their enemies, commaunded
the fotemen, to enuirone &amp; enclose thēselfes about, with their
stakes, but the French horsmen came on so fiersly, that the archers had
no leyser, to set themselfes in a raie. There was no remedy, but to fight
at aduenture. This battaill, cōtinued by the space of thre long houres.
And, although thenglishmen wer ouerpressed, with the nombre of their
aduersaries, yet thei neuer fledde backe one foote, til their capitain the
lorde Talbot, was sore wounded at the backe, and so taken. Then their
hartes began to faint, &amp; thei fled, in whiche flight, there wer slain aboue
xii.C. and taken .xl. wherof the lorde Talbot, the lord Scales, the lord
Hungerford, &amp; sir Thomas Rampston, were the chief: howbeit diuerse
archers whiche had shot all their arrowes, hauyng only their swerdes,
defended thēself, &amp; with the help of some of the horsmen, cā safe to Meū.
               
                  VVHEN the fame was blowen abrode, that the Lorde Talbot was
taken, al the Frenchmen not alitle reioysed, thinkyng surely, that now
the rule of the Englishmen, should shortly assuage and waxe faint: for
feare wherof, the tounes of Ieneuile, Meū, Fort, and diuerse other, returned
from the Englishe part, and became Frenche, to the greate displeasure
of the Regent. Frō this battaill▪ departed without any stroke
striken, sir Ihon Fastolffe, thesame yere for his valiauntnes elected into
the ordre of the Garter. For whiche cause the Duke of Bedford, in a
great anger, toke from hym the Image of sainct George, and his Garter:
but afterward, by meane of frendes, and apparant causes of good
excuse by hym alledged, he was restored to the order again, against the
mynd of the lorde Talbot.
               
                  CHARLES, callyng hymself Frenche Kyng, beyng aduertised of
this victory, thought now, that al thynges succeded, accordyng to his
opinion and good hope, whiche euer, was of that hie corage and haut
mynd, that in his moste aduersitie, he neuer dispaired in good lucke a
                     •
                  
length: so that the Erle of Salisbury beyng dedde, and the lorde Talbot
liuing in captiuitie, (which wer y• glory of his enemies) he thought
to enterprise great and waighty thynges, wher before he medeled with
smal and litle doynges. For fulfillyng of his mynd and appetite, he determined,
first to conquere the citee of Reynes, to the intent, that he beyng
there, might accordyng to the fashion of his progenitors, with all

accustomed Ceremonies, be sacred and anoynted kyng with the holy
ampulle, that all men might se and perceiue, that he was, by all lawes
and decrees, a iust and a lawfull kyng. Wherfore he assemblyng to gether
a great army, &amp; hauyng in his company Ione the Puzel, whom he
vsed as an oracle and a southsaier, passed through Champaigne, by the
toune of Anxer. Thei within, sent to him messēgers, praiyng him of certain
daies of abstinēce of war, in the whiche (if thei wer not rescued) thei
promised to rendre the toune. He not willing to recompence with ingratitude,
the louyng hartes of the citezens, graunted gently to their peticion,
and leuyng there certain persons, to se that thei should not iugle
with hym, departed from thence to Troys, beyng the chief citie of Chā
                  paigne,
whiche he besieged .xii. daies. Sir Phillip Hal capitain there,
vnprouided bothe of vitaill and men, mistrustyng, that aide would not
come in tyme, vpon cōposicion rendered the toune, so that he &amp; his, with
all their moucables might in sauetie depart the citee: whiche demaund
was agreed to. After that Troys was yelded, the commonaltie of Chalons,
rebelled against sir Ihon Awbemōd their capitain, and constrained
hym to deliuer the toune vpon like cōposicion, whiche against his
wil, he was fain to do: and likewise did the citezens of Reyns, desiryng
hym to geue saueconduite to all Englishemen, safely to departe.
               
                  VVHEN he had thus conquered Reyns, he in the presence of all the
noblemen of his faccion, and the dukes of Lorayne and Barre, was sacred
kyng of Fraūce, by the names of Charles the .vi. with all rites and
ceremonies therto apperteinyng. Thei of Anxer which wer not rescued
within the tyme appoynted, brought the kayes to hym, and submitted
theimselfes to his obeysaunce: likewise did all the citees and tounes
adioynyng, geuyng thankes to almightie God, whiche hauyng compassion
of their misery, had restored them to libertie and fredome. The
Duke of Bedford, hearyng that these tounes and soyssons also, had returned
to the part of his aduersaries, and that Charles late Dolphyn
had taken vpon hym the name and estate of the Kyng of Fraunce, and
also, seyng that daily, citees and tounes returned from thenglishe part
and became Frenche, as though the Englishmen had now lost al their
hardy chieftaines and valiaūt men of warre, espied and euidently perceiued,
that the laste and vettermoste poynt of recouery, was driuen only
to ouercome by battaill, and to subdue by force. By whiche victory,
(as he putte his confidence in God) he trusted not onely to scourge and
plague the citees, whiche were so sodainly chaungeable, but also to assuage
and caulme the haute corage of the newe sacred Frenche Kyng
and his companions. Wherfore, he hauyng together .x.M. good Englishemen,
(beside Normans) departed out of Paris, in warlike fashiō
and passed through Brye to Monstrean Faultyow, and there sente by
Bedforde his herault letters to the Frenche kyng, alledgyng to hym
that he contrary to the lawes of God and man, yea, and contrary to the
finall conclusion, taken, concorded, and agreed betwene his noble brother

kyng, Henry the fifth, and kyng Charles, the .v. father to thesaid
nowe v
                     •
                  urper, leuyng all humayne reason and honest communicacion,
(whiche sometyme appeaseth debates and pacifieth strifes) onely allured
and intised by a deuilishe wytche, and a sathanicall enchaunterese,
had not onely falsely and craftely, taken vpon hym, the name, title and
dignitie of the kyng of Fraūce: But also had, by murder, stelyng, craft,
and deceiptful meanes, violently gotten, and wrongfully kept, diuerse
citees and tounes, belongyng to the kyng of Englande, his moste best
beloued lorde, and moste derest nephew. For pro
                     •
                  e wherof, he was come
doune from Paris, with his armye, into the countrey of Brye, by dent
of swerde and stroke of battaill, to proue his writyng and cause trewe,
willyng his enemie to chose the place, and he in thesame, would geue
hym battayle.
               
                  THE newe Frenche kyng, departyng from his solempne Ceremonies
at Reins, and remouyng from thence to Dampmartine, studiyng
how to compasse the Parisians, ether with money, or with promes, was
somewhat troubled with this message, howbeit, he made a freshe countenaūce,
&amp; a Frenche brag, answeryng to the herault: that he would soner
seke his Master, and the Duke should pursewe hym. The duke of
Bedford hearyng his aunswer, marched toward hym, and pitched his
feld in a strong place, and sent out diuerse of his raungers, to prouoke
the Frenchmen to come forward. The Frenche kyng was in maner determined
to abyde the bettaill, but when he hard saie by his espialles,
that the power and nombre of the Englishemen, wer to his army equal
in power, he determined that it was more for his profite, to abstain frō
battaill without daūger, then to entre into the conflicte with ieopardy:
fearyng, least that with a rashe corage, he might ouerthrowe al his affaires
whiche so effecteously proceded. And so well aduised, he turned
with his army, alitle out of the waie. The duke of Bedford perceiuyng
his faint corage, folowed hym by mountaines and dales, till he came
to a toune in Barre, not farre from Senlys, where he found the Frēch
kyng and his army. Wherfore he ordred his battail, like a man expert
in marciall science, settyng the archers before, and hymself with the noblemen
in the mayne battaill, and put the Normans on bothe sides for
the wynges. The Frenche kyng also ordered his battailes, accordyng
to the deuise of his capitaines. Thus, these twoo armies without any
greate doyng, (except a fewe skirmishes, in the whiche the dukes light
horsmen did very valiauntly) laye eche in sight of other, by the space of
twoo daies and twoo nightes. But when the Frenche kyng sawe, and
perceiued, how glad, how diligent and coragious the Englishmen wer
to fight and geue battail, he imagened that by his tariyng, one of these
twoo thynges must nedes chaūce: that is to saie, either he should fight
against his will, or lye still like a cowarde, to his greate rebuke and infamy.
Wherefore in the dedde of the night, (as priuely as he could) he
brake vp his campe and fled to Bray. When this flight was perceiued

in the mornyng, the Regent could scace refrain his people, from folowyng
the Frenche army, callyng them, cowardes, dastardes, and loutes,
and therfore, he perceiuing that by no meanes, he could allure the new
Frenche kyng to abide battaill, mistrustyng the Parisiās, and geuyng
no great credite to their faire, swete, and flatteryng woordes, returned
again to Paris, to assemble together a greater power, and so to prosecute
his enemies.
               
                  IN this season, the Bohemians, (whiche belike had espied the vsurped
authoritie of the bishop of Rome) began to rebell against his sea,
which, (as Eneas Siluius doth report) wer fallē into certain sectes of
heresie. Wherefore, Martyn the fifth bishop of Rome, wrote vnto them
to abstain from warre, and to be reconciled by reason, from their damnable
opinions. But thei, (beyng persuaded to the contrary) neither
gaue eare vnto hym, nor yet obeyed his voyce. Wherfore the bishop of
Rome, wrote to the princes of Germany, to inuade y• realme of Beame,
as the denne of heretikes, and caue of deuilishe doctryne. Besyde this,
he appoynted Henry bishop of Winchester, and Cardinall of. S. Eusebie,
a mā very wel borne, (as you haue hard) but no better borne then
high stomacked, and yet no higher stomacked, then abundantly enriched,
to be his legate in this greate iorney, and to bryng out men from
the realme of Englande, into the countrey of Beame. And because the
warre touched religion, he licenced thesaid Cardinall, to take the tenth
part of euery spirituall dignitie, benefice, and promociō. This matter,
was declared in open Parliament in Englande, and not dissented, but
gladly assented to, wherfore the bishop gathered the money, and assembled
foure thousand men and mo▪ not without great grudge of the people,
whiche daily were with tallages and aides weried, and sore burdened.
And when men, municions, and money wer ready for his high enterprise,
he with all his people came to the sea stronde at Douer, ready
to passe ouer the sea into Flaunders.
               
                  BVT in the meane season, the Duke of Bedforde consideryng, how
tounes daily wer gotten, and countries hourely wonne in the realme
of Fraunce, for lacke of sufficient defence and nombre of men of warre,
wrote to his brother the duke of Gloucester, to releue him with aide, in
that tempestious tyme and troubelous season. When this letter was
brought into Englande, the duke of Gloucester was not alitle amased,
because he had no army redy to sende at that tyme: for by the reason of
the Crewe, sent into Beame, he could not sodainly reyse a newe armye.
But because the matter was of suche importaunce, and might neither
be, frō day to day differred, nor yet long delaied, he wrote to the bishop
of Winchester, to passe with all his army toward the duke of Bedford,
whiche at that tyme had bothe nede of men and assistaūce, consideryng
that now, all stoode vpon losse or gaine: whiche thyng doen, and to his
honor acheued, he might performe his iorney against the vngracious
Bohemians. Although the Cardinall was somewhat moued with this

countermaunde, yet least he should be noted, not to ayde the Regent of
Fraunce, in so greate a cause and so necessary an entreprise, he bowed
from his former iorney, and passed the sea with all his company, and
brought them to his cosyn, to the citee of Paris.
               
                  CHARLES the Frenche Kyng, hauyng knowledge in the meane
season by his espialls, whiche went round about the countrey, to intise
and sollicite tounes and citees, to returne from the Englishe part, and
become Frenche, that the inhabitātes of Champeigne, and Beuauoys
ought hym greate loue and synguler fauor, and gladly coueted to renounce
the subieccion of England, and to be vnder his proteccion, and
also offred to open hym their gates, so that thei should not therby, be in
ieoperdy of their lifes and losse of their goodes, with all hast &amp; diligēce
remoued towarde Champeigne. The duke of Bedford beyng aduertised
of his progresse, and hauyng his armie augmented, with the new
aide, whiche the cardinal had of late conducted, marched forward with
greate spede to encountre and geue battaill, to his mortall enemy the
Frenche kyng. When the duke was come to Senlys, the Frenchemen
wer lodged on the Mountpilioll. betwene Senlis and Champiegne.
Euery army knew of other, and euery hoste might behold other. Then
the cāpes wer trenched, and the battailes pitched, and the feldes ordered.
Thus, these great armies lay two daies, nothyng doyng but with
skirmishes, in the whiche the Normans sore vexed the Frenchemen.
Wherefore the lorde Regent, gaue to them many high laudes and praisynges,
and determined surely the next daie, to set on the Frenche kyng
in his cāpe, if he would not remoue out, and abide battaill. But while
kyng Charles did politiquely consider, what a variable lady, Fortune
was, and what a sodain and vnthought chaūce of a smal thyng, might
do in a battaill: for the detrimentes and ouerthrowes, that he and his
nacion had taken and tasted by thenglishemen, wer to them a lernyng,
an example and a plaine experiment, to auoyde open ioynyng, mutual
cōflict, and force to force. And beside that, he had by his explorators and
spies, plain and perfect knowledge, y• many and diuerse citees &amp; tounes
in Fraunce, abhorryng thenglishe libertie, and aspiryng to the French
bondage and natiue seruitude, (accordyng to the nature of Asses, whiche
the more thei be charged with, the more thei desire) would, (whē thei
sawe their tyme) not onely rebell and returne to his faccion and parte,
but also were ready to aide and assiste hym, in recouery of his desired
realme and auncient dominion, in expellyng also the Englishe nacion,
out of the territories of Fraunce. And therefore, he imagined that the
duke of Bedforde, was so hasty to geue hym battaill, thynkyng, that if
he then wer ouercome, the game had, for the Englishemen been clerely
gotten, &amp; to the Frenchemen, a perpetuall checkemate. Wherfore he determined
neuer, (except very necessitie compelled or constrained him) to
fight in open battaill with the Englishmen, nor by a feld to aduenture
his realme with thē, of whom his predecessors so often tymes had been

vanquished. Wherfore, like a carpet capitain, he in the night, remoued
his campe and fled to Crespy, and yet his nōbre was double to the Englishe
army. The duke of Bedforde, seyng that the Frenche kyng, was
thus cowardly retrayted, and as a man, whiche durste not once assaie
the stroke of an Englishe arme, shamefully reculed: with all his power
and armie, returned agayn to Paris, sore suspectyng the deceiptfull
faith of the pollitique Parisians. The bishop of Winchester, after the
Frenche kynges flight, went into Beame, and there did somewhat, but
what it was, authors kepe silence, and so do I: But shortly, he without
any greate praise, and small gayne, returned into Englande, more glad
of his retraite, then of his aduaūsyng forwarde. Sone after, the bishop
of Rome without his agrement, vnlegated hym, and set another in his
stede &amp; authoritie, with which doyng, he was neither cōtent nor pleased.

kyng Henry, in the eight yere of his reigne, was, at Westminster
with all pompe and honor, crouned kyng of this realme
of England. At whiche coronacion, to reherse the costly faire,
the delicate meate, the pleasaunt wines, the nombre of courses, the sortes
of dishes, the labors of officers, the multitude of people, the estates
of Lordes, the beauties of Ladies, the riches of apparell, the curious
deuises, the solempne banquettes, it would aske a long tyme, and wery
you: Wherfore leauyng the pleasaunt pastyme in England, I will returne
to the troubleous warres in Fraunce.
               
                  AFTER that the French kyng was fled from the duke of Bedford,
(as you haue harde before) and was come to Crespy in Ualoys, he was
credibly informed, how the citezens of Champaigne, desired greatly to
be vnder his gouernaunce and subieccion. Wherfore, he mindyng not
to lese so faire an offred prey, ceased not, til he came to the toune, where,
with all reuerence and benignitie, he was receiued and welcomed. And
after that, were rendered to hym, the tounes of Senlis and Beauoys.
And the Lorde Longuenall tooke by stelth, the castle of Aumarle and
slewe all the Englishemen, and in short space, the lorde Barbasan, whiche
long had been prisoner in the Castle Gaylard, so muche, what with
faire wordes and large promises, persuaded his kepers, that he not only
deliuered his awne persone, but also caused the toune, to turne from
thenglishmen, to the part of kyng Charles his Master. Whiche kyng,
although he muche reioysed, at the good successe, that Fortune had to
hym sente, yet he was somwhat desperate, how to recouer his countrey
from the possession of the Englishemen, except he vnknitted the knotte
and league, betwene the duke of Burgoyn and them. Wherfore, he sent
his Chauncellor, &amp; diuerse Ambassadors to the duke of Burgoyn, first,
excusyng himself of the death &amp; murder, of duke Ihon his father, &amp; after,
declaryng to him, that there could be nothing more foule, more dishonest,

nor more detestable, then, for his awne peculiar cause, &amp; priuate
displeasure, to ioyne with his auncient enemies, and perpetual aduersaries,
against his natiue countrey and naturall nacion: not onely requiryng
hym, of concord, peace, and amitie, but also promisyng golden
mountaines, and many more benefites, then at that tyme, he was either
able or could performe. This message was not so secrete, nor the doyng
so closely cloked, but the Duke of Bedford, thereof was plainly informed.
Whiche, beyng sore troubled, and vnquieted in his mind, because
he sawe the power of thenglishe nacion, daily waxe lesse, he, of al thynges,
first forseyng, if any losse should of necessitie chaunce, of those tounes
and countreis, whiche his noble brother, kyng Henry the fifth had
conquered, in the very countrey of Fraunce, for lacke of tuicion or defence:
yet for an ankerhold, he determined to kepe, possesse, and defende,
the Duchie of Normandy, the olde inheritaunce and aunciente patrimony,
of the kynges of Englande, and frō them onely, by force and not
by iustice, by violence and not by right, sithe the tyme of Kyng Henry
the thirde, (the deuilishe deuision then reignyng in the realme) wrongfully
deteined, and iniuriously vsurped. Wherefore, he diligently prouidyng,
for thynges that might chaunce, appoynted gouernor of the
citee of Paris, Lewes of Luxenberough, bishop of Turwine and Ely,
beyng Chauncellor of Fraunce, for the kyng of England, a man of no
lesse wit, then of birthe, leuyng with hym, a conuenient nombre of Englishemen
to defende bothe the citee and territory of Paris, &amp; the isle of
Fraūce then beyng in the Englishmens possession and gouernaunce.
               
                  THESE thynges thus ordered, he departed from Paris, into Normandy,
and called at Roan a parliament, of the thre estates of the duchie,
in the whiche he declared vnto them, the great liberties, the manifolde
priueleges, the innumerable benefites, whiche thei had receiued
of the kynges of Englande, duryng the tyme, that thei wer possessors
and lordes of thesame duchie, not puttyng in obliuion, the misery, bondage,
and calamitie, whiche thei had sustained, by the intollerable yoke
and daily tributes, continually layed in their neckes like Asses, by the
cruell and coueteous Frenchemen: and puttyng theim also in remembraunce,
how the kynges of England, wer not only brought furth and
discēded, of the Normans bloud &amp; progeny, but wer the very true &amp; vndoubtfull
heires, to thesame countrey and duchie, lineally succedyng &amp;
lawfully discendyng from Rollo the hardy, first duke and prince of the
same dominion: Requiryng theim farther, to liue in loue and amitie
emongest theim self, to be true and obedient, to the kyng their soueraigne
Lorde, and to kepe their othe and promes, made and sworne to his
noble brother, kyng Henry the .v. promisyng to them, Englishe libertie
and priueleges royall. While the duke of Bedford was thus, intertainyng
and encoragyng the Normans, Charles the newe Frenche kyng,
beyng of his departure aduertised, longyng and thrystyng for to obtain
Paris, the chief citee &amp; principall place of resort, within the whole

realme of Fraunce, departed from the toune of Senlis well accompanied,
and came to the toune of sainct Denise, whiche he found desolate,
and abandoned of all garrison, and good gouernaūce. Wherfore, with
out force and small damage, he entered into the voyed toune, and lodged
his armie at Mountmartyr, and Abberuilliers, nere adioynyng,
and liyng to the citee of Paris. And from thence, sent, Ihon duke of Alaunson,
and his sorceresse Ione, (called the mayde, sent from God)
in whom, his whole affiaunce then consisted, with thre thousande light
horsmen, to get again the citie of Paris, either by force, or by faire flatteryng,
or reasonable treatie, and after them, he without delaie or defer
ryng of tyme, with all his power, came betwene Moūtmartyr and Paris,
and sodainly, appproched the gate of sainct Honore, setting vp ladders
to the walles, and castyng faggottes into the diches, as though,
he would with a French bragge, sodainly haue gottē the faire cite. But
thenglishe capitaines, euery one kepyng his ward and place assigned,
so manfully and fiersly, with a noble corage, defended themselfes, their
walles and toures, with the assistence of the Parisians, that thei rebutted
and draue awaie the Frenchmen, &amp; threwe doune Ione, their greate
goddesse, into the botome of the toune ditche, where she laie behynd the
backe of an Asse, sore hurte, till the tyme, that she all filthy with mire
and durte, was drawen out, by Guyschard of Thienbrone, seruaunt to
the duke of Alaunson. The Frenche Kyng, seyng the greate losse, that
he had susteined at this assaut, and accompted, his pretensed conquest,
in maner impossible, leuyng the dedde bodies behind hym, and takyng
with hym, the wounded capitaines, whiche wer of no small nombre, returned
into Berry. But in the meane waie, the citezens of Laignie, became
his subiectes, and made to hym an othe, promisyng to continewe
from thence furth to hym, bothe true and obedient.
               
                  THE Duke of Bedford, beyng in Normandy, and hearyng of this
sodain attempt, lost no tyme, nor spared no trauaile, till he came to Paris.
Where he, not only thanked the capitaines, and praised the citezēs
for their assured fidelitie and good will, towarde their kyng and souereigne
lorde, but also extolled their hardines, &amp; manly doynges, aboue
the Starres, and high elementes: promisyng to them, honor, fame, and
greate aduauncementes. Whiche gentle exhortacion, so incoraged and
inflamed the hartes of the Parisians, that thei sware, promised, and cō
                  cluded,
to be frendes euer to the kyng of Englande and his frendes,
and enemies alwaies to his foes and aduersaries, makyng proclamacion
by this stile. Frendes to Kyng Henry, frendes to the Parisians,
enemies to England, enemies to Paris. But if thei spake it with their
hartes, either for feare, that Charles the Frenche kyng, should not punishe
them, if he once obteined the superioritie, ouer their citee, &amp; toune,
or that thei flattred thenglishmen, to put themselfes in credite with the
chief capitaines, you shal plainly perceiue, by the sequele of their actes
               
                  SONE after these doynges, came to Paris with a greate company,

Phillip duke of Burgoyn, whiche was of the Regent, and the lady his
wife, honorably receiued, and highly feasted. And after long consultacion
had, for recoueryng of the tounes, lately by the Frenche kyng stollen
and taken, it was agreed, that the duke of Bedford, should rayle an
armie, for the recouery of thesaid fortresses, and that the duke of Burgoyne,
should be his deputie, and tary at Paris, for the defence of the
same. After this greate bu
                     •
                  inesse, thus concluded, and appoynted, the
Duke of Bedforde hymself, without any greate resistaunce, recouered
again the toune of sainct Denise, and diuerse other Castles. And after
that doen, he sent the Bastard of Clarence, to laye siege to the Castle of
Toursie, beyng bothe by the naturall situacion, and mannes pollicie,
very strong, and in maner vnable to be beaten doune. The siege continued
sixe monethes, but in conclusion, the capitain discomfited of al releue
and succor, rendered the fortresse, the life of hym and his souldiers
only saued. Whiche offre was taken, &amp; the castle raised, and cast doune
to the grounde. Duryng this siege, sir Thomas Kiriell knight, with
foure hundred Englishemen, departed from Gourney in Normandy,
and rode by Beauoys, spoylyng, robbyng, and wastyng the countrey,
to the suburbes of Cleremount. Wherof, hearyng the Erle of thesame
toune, assembled all the men of warre, of the garrisons adioynyng, to
fight with thenglishmen: and so the Frenchemen with all diligence 
                     •
                  et
forward, &amp; found their enemies in a straight place, nere vnto Beauois.
The erle of Cleremount seyng, that he could not hurte theim, with his
men of armes, by reason of the straight, came doune on fote with al his
company, and fiersly set on the Englishmen. The fight was fierse, and
the aduauntage doubtful. But in conclusion, the archers shot so terriblie,
that the Frenchmen, not able to abide the smart, and gaules of the
arrowes, fled a pace, and the Englishmen leuyng the straight, leped on
horsebacke, and folowed the chase. In the whiche wer taken twoo hundred
prisoners, and thrise as many slain. The Erle, by the swiftnesse of
his horsse, escaped his enemies, and came to the toune of Beauoys:
and so sir Thomas Kiriell, with plentie of spoyle and prisoners, returned
to Goruay, renderyng to GOD his hartie thankes, for that good
chaunce and happie victory.
               
                  YET Fortune sent not this good lucke alone, for therle of Suffolk
at thesame very season, besiegyng the toune of Aumarle, wherof was
capitain the lord Rambures, (after .xxiiii. great assautes geuen to the
fortresse) had the toune and castle to hym symply rendered. Wherefore,
he caused .xxx. of the tounes men, for their vntruthe, to be hanged on
the walles, and al the rest he raunsomed, and sent the capitain into Englande,
where he remained sixe yeres continually, &amp; after by excaunge
was deliuered. After this, the erle fortified the toune, with men, municions
and vitaile, and so by a litle and litle, the Englishmen recouered
again many tounes, whiche before thei had loste, without any greate
losse of their people. Whiche thyng, the Frenchemen well consideryng,

imagined by what meanes, how to get again the toune of Laual, whiche
y• lorde Talbot (before as you haue hard) gat, by scalyng in a night.
Wherfore, to possesse their desired prey, thei with money, and gay promises,
first corrupted a Miller, that kept a Mil adioynyng to the wal,
so that the Miller, suffered the lorde Homet with thre hundred other, to
passe through his Mill into the toune, in a very darke night. When
thei were entered, thei slewe the kepers of the gate, and let in the Lorde
Bertrand be la Ferrier, with fiue hundred men of armes: whiche either
slewe or toke prisoners, all thenglishemen within the toune. And shortly
after, sir Stephin de Uignoles called the Heire, toke by scalyng, th
                     •
                  
toune of Lonuiers in Normādy, and did muche damage, to all the tounes
adioynyng.
            
            
               ¶The nynth yere.The ix. yere.
               
               
                  WHile these chaunces happened, betwene the Englishmen
and Frenchemen, Phillip duke of Burgoyne,
maried the Lady Isabell, daughter to Ihon, Kyng
of Portyngall, and greate aunte to the kyng of Englande.
In honor of whiche mariage, he instituted
and began an ordre of .xxxvi. knightes without reproche,
called the ordre of the golden flece, and deuised
statutes, mantels, collers, and Ceremonies for thesame, muche like
to the ordinaunces, of the noble ordre of the Garter begonne in Englande,
almoste an hundred yeres before the inuencion, of this fraternitie
and frēdship. On the whiche wife, he begat, the hardy duke Charles,
father to Marie, after maried to Maximiliā kyng of the Romans,
as (when place requireth) shalbe hereafter to you declared.
               
                  IN this very season, the Englishemen in the colde moneth of Decembre,
besieged the toune of Laigny, in the whiche was the Puzel and
diuerse other good capitaines. But the weither was so cold, &amp; the raine
so greate and so continuall, that thei, of force cōpelled, not by their enemies,
but by intemperate season, reised their siege: and in their returne,
Puzell and all the garrison within the toune, issued out and fought
with thenglishmen, where, (after lōg fightyng) bothe parties departed
without either greate gain or losse. After this enterprise doen, the duke
of Burgoyne, accompanied with the erles of Arundell and Suffolke,
and the lorde Ihon of Luxenbrough, and with a great puissaunce, besieged
the toune of Champeigne: whiche toune was well walled, manned,
and vitailed, so that the besiegers, must either by assaut or long tariyng,
wery or famishe theim within the toune. So thei caste trenches,
and made moynes, and studied al the waies that thei could deuise, how
to compasse their cōquest and enterprise. And it happened in the night
of the Assencion of our lorde, that Pothon of Xentraxles, Ione the Puzell,
and fiue or sixe hundred men of armes, issued out of Chāpeigne, by
the gate of the bridge towarde Mowntdedier, intendyng to set fire in

the tentes and lodgynges of the lord of Baudo, whiche was then gone
to Marigny, for the Duke of Burgoyns affaires. At whiche tyme, sir
Ihon of Luxenborough, with eight other gentlemen (whiche had riden
aboute the toune to serche and vieue, in what place the toune might be
moste aptly and conueniently assauted or scaled) were come nere to the
lodges of the lorde of Baudo, where thei espied the Frenchmen, whiche
began to cut doune tentes, ouerthrowe pauilions, and kil men in their
beddes. Wherefore, shortely thei assembled a greate nombre of men, as
well Englishe as Burgonions, and coragiously set on the Frenchmen.
Sore was the fight and greate was the slaughter, in so muche that the
Frenchemen, not able lenger to indure, fled into the toune so faste, that
one letted the other to entre. In whiche chace was taken, Ione the Puzell,
and diuerse other: whiche Ione was sent to the duke of Bedford to
Roan, wher, (after lōg examinaciō) she was brent to ashes. This wytch
or manly woman, (called the maide of GOD) the Frenchemen greatly
glorified and highly extolled, alledgyng that by her Orleaūce was vitailed:
by her, kyng Charles was sacred at Reynes, and that by her, the
Englishemen wer often tymes put backe and ouerthrowen. O Lorde,
what dispraise is this to the nobilitie of Fraunce? What blotte is this
to the Frenche nacion? What more rebuke can be imputed to a renoumed
region, then to affirme, write &amp; confesse, that all notable victories,
and honorable conquestes, which neither the kyng with his power, nor
the nobilitie with their valiauntnesse, nor the counsaill with their wit,
nor the cōmonaltie with their strenght, could compasse or obtain, were
gotten and achiued by a shepherdes daughter, a chamberlein in an hostrie,
and a beggers brat: whiche blindyng the wittes of the French nacion,
by reuelacions, dreames &amp; phantasticall visions, made thē beleue
thynges not to be supposed, and to geue faithe to thynges impossible.
For surely, if credite maie be geuen to the actes of the Clergie, openly
doen, and cōmonly shewed, this woman was not inspired with the holy
ghoste, nor sent from God, (as the Frenchemen beleue) but an enchā
                  teresse,
an orgayne of the deuill, sent from Sathan, to blind the people
and bryng them in vnbelife: as by this letter, sent frō the kyng of Englande,
to the duke of Burgoyn, to you euidently shall appere.
               
                  
                     
                        MOSTE dere and welbeloued vncle, the feruent loue and great affeccion,
whiche you (like a very catholique prince) beare to our Mother
holy Churche, and to the aduauncement of our faithe, doth bothe
resonably admonishe, and frendly exhort vs, to signifie and write vnto
you, suche thynges, whiche, to the honor of our Mother holy Churche,
strengthenyng of our faith, and pluckyng vp by the rotes, of moste pestilent
errors, haue been solemply doen within our citee of Roan. It is
commonly renoumed, and in euery place published, that the woman,
commonly called the Puzell, hath by the space of twoo yeres and more,
contrary to Goddes lawe, and the estate of womanhed, been clothed in
a mannes apparell, a thyng in the sight of God abhominable. And in

this estate, caried ouer and conueyed, to the presence of our chief enemy
and yours, to whom, &amp; to the prelates, nobles, &amp; commons of his parte,
she declared that she was sent from God, presumptuously makyng her
vaunt, that she had communicacion personally, and visibly with sainct
Michaell, and a greate multitude of Angels, and sainctes of heauen,
as sainct Katheryn, and sainct Margarete: by the whiche falshode and
subtilitie, she made diuerse beleue, and trust in her faithe, promisyng to
them, greate and notable victories, by the whiche meane, she did turne
the hartes of many men and women, from the truthe and veritie, and
conuerted theim to lies and errors. Beside this, she vsurped a cote of
armes, and displaid a standard, whiche thynges, be apperteinyng only
to knightes and esquiers: and of a greate outrage, and more pride and
presumpciō, she demaunded, to beare the noble and excellent Armes of
Fraunce, whiche she in part obteined, the whiche she bare in many skirmishes
and assautes, and her brethrē also (as men report) that is to say:
the feld azure, a swerd, the poynt vpward in pale siluer, set betwene two
flower deluces, firmed with a croune of gold. And in this estate, she cam
into the feld, &amp; guided men of war, and gathred cōpanies, &amp; assēbled hostes
to excercise vnnatural cruelties, in sheding of christen bloud, &amp; stirryng
sedicions, and commocions emongest the people, inducyng them,
to periurie, rebellion, supersticiō and false error, in disturbyng of peace
and quietnes, and renewyng of mortal warre. Beside this, causyng her
self to be honored and worshipped of many, as a woman sanctified, and
dampnably openyng, diuerse imagined cases long to reherse, in diuerse
places well knowen and apparantly proued. Wherby, almoste al Christendom
is slaundered. But the diuine puissaunce, hauyng compassion
vpon his true people, and willyng no lenger to leaue them in peril, nor
suffre thē, to abyde still in waies daungerous, and newe cruelties, hath
lightly permitted, of his greate mercie and clemency, thesaied puzell to
be taken in your host and siege, whiche you kept for vs before Champeigne,
and by youre good meane, deliuered into our obeysaunce and
dominion. And because, we were required, by the bishoppe of the Dioces,
wher she was takē, (because she was noted, suspected, and defamed
to be a traitor to almightie God) to deliuer her to hym, as to her ordinary
and Ecclesiasticall iudge: We, for the reuerence of oure Mother
holy Churche, (whose ordinaunces wee will preferre, as oure awne dedes
and willes, as reason it is) and also for the aduauncement of Christen
faithe, bayled thesaied Ione to hym, to the intent that he should
make processe against her: not willyng any vengeaunce, or punishmēte
to be shewed to her, by any officers of our secular Iustices, whiche thei
might haue lawfully and resonablie doen, consideryng the greate hurtes,
damages▪ and incōueniences, the horrible murders, and detestable
cruelties, &amp; other innumerable mischiefes, whiche she hath committed
in our territories, against our people, and obediēt subiectes. The whiche
bishop, takyng in company to hym, the Uicar and inquisitor of errors,

and herisies, and callyng to them, a great and notable nombre of
solempne doctors, and masters in diuinitie, and lawe Canon, began by
great solempnitie, and grauitie, accordyngly, to procede in the cause of
the saied Ione. And after that, thesaid bishop and inquisitor, iudges in
this cause, had at diuerse daies ministered, certain interrogatories to
the said Ione, and had caused the confessions &amp; assercions of her, truly
to be examined by thesaid doctors and masters, and in conclusiō generally,
by all the faculties of our dere and welbeloued daughter the Uniuersity
of Paris. Against whom, (the confessions and asserciōs, maturely
and deliberatly considered) the Iudges, Doctors, &amp; all other the
parties aforesaied, adiudged thesame Ione, a supersticious sorceresse,
and a diabolical blasphemeresse of God, and of his sainctes: and a persone
scismatike and erronious, in the lawe of Iesu Christe. And for to
reduce and bryng her again, to the communion and company, of oure
Mother holy Churche, and to purge, her of her horrible, and pernicious
crimes and offences, and to saue and preserue her soule, from perpetuall
payne and dampnacion, she was moste charitably and fauorably
admonished and aduised, to put away and abhor, all her errors and
erronious doynges, and to returne humbly to the right way, and come
to the very veritie of a Christen creature, or els to put her soule and body
in great perell and ieoperdie. But all this notwithstandyng, the perelous
and inflamed spirit of pride, and of outragious presumpciō, the
whiche continually enforceth hymself, to breke and dissolue the vnitye
of Christen obedience, so clasped in his clawes, the harte of this woman
Ione, that she, neither by any ghostly exhortacion, holy admonicion, or
any other wholsome doctrine, whiche might to her bee shewed, would
mollifie her harde harte, or bryng her to humilitie. But she aduaunced
and auowed, that all thynges by her doen, wer well doen: yea, and doen
by the commaundementes of GOD, and the sainctes before rehersed,
plainly to her apperyng: Referryng the iudgement of her cause, onely
to God, and to no iudge or counsaill, of the Churche militant. Wherefore,
the Iudges Ecclesiasticall, perceiuyng her hard harte, so long to
continue, caused her to be brought furth, in a common auditorie, before
the Clergie and people, in a great multitude, there, for that purpose assembled.
In which presence wer opened, manifested, &amp; declared, solemply,
openly, and truly, by a master in diuinitie, of notable learnyng and
vertuous life, to the aduauncement of the catholike faithe, and extirpyng
of errors and false opinions, all her confessions and assercions,
charitably admonishyng, and persuadyng her to returne, to the vnion
and feloship of Christes Churche, and to correct and amend, the fautes
and offences, in the whiche she was so obstinate and blinde. And accordyng
to the lawe, the Iudges aforesaid, begainne to procede and pronounce
the iudgement and 
                           •
                        entence, in that case of right apparteining.
Yet, before the Iudge, had fully declared the sentence, she began somewhat
to abate her corage, and saied that she would, reconcile her self, to

our Mother the holy Churche, bothe gladly and wyllyngly. The
Iudges, and other Ecclesiasticall persones, gentely receiued her offer,
hopyng by this meane, that bothe her body and soule, wer gottē again
out of eternall losse and perdicion. And so, she submitted her self, to the
ordinaunce of the holy Churche, and with her mouthe, openly reuoked,
her errores and detestable crimes: and thesame, abiured openly,
signyng with her hande, thesaied abiuracion, and reuocacion. Where
vpon, oure Mother holy Churche, beeyng pitifull and mercifull, glad
and reioysyng of a synner, that will conuerte, willyng the strayed
shepe to returne again to his folde and flocke, condēpned thesaid Ione
onely to doo open penaunce. But the fire of her pride, whiche was in
her harte, sodainly brast out into hurtfull flames, blowen out by the belowes
of enuie: and incontinent after, she tooke again, all her errors
and false opinions, by her before, adiuered and reuoked, for whiche causes,
accordyng to the iudgementes and institucions of holy churche, to
the intent that she, herea
                           •
                        ter should not defile, any other membre of the
flocke, of our Lorde Iesus Christe: was again exhorted, and preached
to openly. And because she still was obstinate, in her trespaces and villanous
offences, she was deliuered to the secular power, the whiche cō
                        dempned
her, to be brent, and cōsumed her in the fire. And when she saw
that the fatall daie of her obstinacie was come, she opēly confessed, that
the spirites, whiche to her often did appere, were euill and false, and
apparant liers, and that their promes, which thei had made, to deliuer
her out of captiuitie, was false and vnt rue: affirmyng her self, by those
spirites to bee often beguiled, blynded, and mocked. And so beyng in
good mynde, she was by the Iustices, carried to the olde market, within
the citee of Roan, and there by the fire, consumed to asshes, in the sight
of all the people.
                  
               
               
                  THIS letter, the kyng of Englande, sente not onely to the Duke of
Burgoyne, and other Princes, to declare the veritie of the matter, and
the administracion of Iustice, but to admonishe all rude and ignorant
persones, in all other countries, to refraine, from the credite and belefe
of the saiynges, of suche prophane prophesies, and craftie imageners,
as this peuishe painted Puzel was. Yet notwithstandyng, this lawful
processe, this due examinacion and publike sentence, Thō Buchet, and
diuerse Frenche writers affirme her to be a saincte in heauen. But because,
it is no poynt of our faith, no man is bound to beleue his iudgement,
although he were an Archedeken. But Paulus Emilius, a famous
writer, rehersyng that the citezens of Orleaunce, had buylded in
the honor of her, an Image or an Idole, saith: y• Pius bishop of Rome,
and Anthony bishop of Florence, muche merueiled and greately wondered
at her actes and doynges. With whiche saiyng, I can very well
agree, that she was more to be marueiled at, as a false prophetisse, and
seducer of the people: then to be honored or worshipped as a sainct sent
from God into the realme of Fraunce. For of this I am sure, that all

auncient writers, aswell deuine, as prophane, alledge these three thynges,
beside diuerse other, to apparteine to a good woman. First, shamefastnesse,Thre properties that appertayne to a good womā.
whiche the Romain Ladies 
                     •
                  o kept, that seldome or neuer thei
wer seen openly talkyng with a man: whiche vertue, at this day emongest
the Turkes, is highly estemed. The seconde, is pitie: whiche in a
womans harte, abhorteth the spillyng of the bloud of a poore beast, or
a sely birde. The third, is womanly behauor, aduoydyng the occasion
of euill iudgement, and causes of slaundre. If these qualities, be of necessitie,
incident to a good woman, where was her shamefastnes, when
she daily and nightly, was conuersant with comen souldiors, and men
of warre, amongest whom, is small honestie, lesse vertue, and shamefastnesse,
least of all excercised or vsed? Where was her womanly pitie, whē
she takyng to her, the harte of a cruell beaste, flewe, man, woman, and
childe, where she might haue the vpper hand? Where was her womanly
behauor, when she cladde her self in a mannes clothyng, and was cō
                  uersaunt
with euery losell, geuyng occasion to all men to iudge, and
speake euill of her, and her doynges. Then these thynges, beyng thus
plainly true, all men must nedes confesse, that the cause ceasyng, the effect
also ceaseth: so y•, if these morall vertues lackyng, she was no good
womā, then it must nedes, consequently folowe, that she was no sainct.
               
                  NOVV leuyng this woman, consumed to asshes, lette vs returne
agayne, to the siege of Compeigne, whiche still continewed. Duryng
whiche tyme, the Regent sente to the Duke of Burgoyne, liyng at
the siege, the erle of Huntyngdon, sir Ihon Robsert, with a thousande
Archers, whiche daily skirmished, with theim of the toune, and made
suche Bastiles and fortresses, that the toune must nedes be rendered, or
els thei within, famished. But se the chaunce, when victory was at hād
Tidynges wer brought to the duke of Burgoyn, that Phillip duke of
Brabante, was departed out of this worlde, leuyng behynde hym, no
heire of his bodie: To whom, thesaied duke pretended to be next heire.
Wherfore, he takyng with hym, his best capitaines, of the recouery of

                     •
                  o greate a duchy, departed from the siege, leuyng his poore people behynd
hym, and ordeined in his place, for his leuetenaunt, sir Ihon Luxenborough,
whiche beyng, of small strength and lesse corage, after the
dukes departyng, aduised the Englishmen, to depart for that tyme, till
the next sommer: whiche therto at the first, would in nowise agree. But
there was no remedy, for he was capitain generall, and had the ordynaunce
vnder his rule, so that without that, thei could nothyng doo:
Wherfore, in greate displeasure, thei returned into Normandy. After
whose departure, the capitain set fire in all the bastiles, and secretly departed,
leuyng behynde hym, diuerse peces of ordynaunce, for lacke of
cariage. With which returne, the dukes of Bedford and Burgoyn, wer
sore displeased: for if he had continued his siege, eight daies lenger, the
toune had been rendered, without dent of swerd. For pestilence and famyne,
had almoste consumed all the souldiors, and left the toune, with

out sauegard or defence.
               
                  AFTER this siege broken vp, Ihon duke of Norffolke, toke again
the tounes of Dāpmartyn, and the Chasse Mongay, and diuerse other
tounes. And therle of Stafford, toke the toune of Brie, in Countie Robert,
and from thense, forraged al the countrey to Sens, and after toke
Quesnoy in Brie, Grand Puys, and Rampellon, with many prisoners
as sir Iaques de Milly, and sir Ihon de la Hay. Duryng whiche tyme
the Frenchemen toke Louiers, &amp; Uilluense. And then the toune of Melune
rebelled, and had suche ayde, of other tounes adioynyng, that the
Englishe souldiors, wer fayne to leaue Melune, Morret, and Gorbell.
Thus, accordyng to the chaunce of war, the one part gat, and the other
lost. Thus the Englishe affaires (as you haue hard) within the realme
began to wauer, and waxe variable, whiche caused the Englishe capitaines,
to be of diuerse opinions. For one part, beyng sory and pensiue,
adiudged the thynges present, light and of no moment, in comparison
of them whiche thei sawe likely to folowe: and another sort, adiudged
that present time, to be moste ieoperdus, and moste repleted with perilles:
Because thei sawe, the power of their enemies, now increased, and
their awne strēgth rather decaied, then cōserued. And so euery man studiyng
on this businesse, aduised secretly with hymself, what counsaill
was best to be taken, and what waie was best to be folowed, to remedy
these thynges, thus waueryng, in a doubtful balance. And then it was
concluded, tha it was moste apte and mete, for the tyme presente, that
kyng Henry in his royall person, with a new army, should come doune
into Fraunce, partly to comfort and visite his awne subiectes ther: partly,
either by feare or fauor, (because a childe, of his age and beautie,
dooth commonly allure to hym, the hartes of elder persones,) to cause
the Frenchemen to continue, in their due obeysaunce towarde hym.
Wherfore, after a gret hoste, conuenient for that purpose, assembled,
and money for the maintenaūce of the warre, redy gathered, and the realme
sette in an ordre, and the Duke of Gloucester, appoynted gouernor
(whiche duryng the kynges absence, appeased diuerse riottes, and
punished many offenders,) the kyng with a greate power, tooke shippyng
at Douer, and landed at Calice, and there taried a good space▪
and from thence, he remoued to Roan, where, with al triumphe, he was
receiued, and there soiorned, till the middest of August, his nobles daily
consultyng, on their greate busines, and waightie affaires.

                  IN the moneth of Nouembre, he remoued from Roan to
Ponthoise, and so to saincte Denice, to the intent to make
his entrie, into the citee of Paris, and there to be sacred
kyng of Fraunce, and to receiue, the sceptre and Croune
of the realme and countrey.

                  ury, Oxford, Huntyngdon, Ormond, Mortayn, Suffolke, and
of Gascoynes, the Erle of Longuile, and Marche, beside many noble
men of England, Guyan, and Normandy. And the chief of the Frenche
nacion, wer the dukes of Burgoyn, and Lewes of Luxenbrogh Cardinall
and Chauncellor of Fraunce for kyng Henry, the bishops of Beauoys
and Neyon, bothe peres of Fraunce, beside the bishopp of Paris,
and diuerse other bishoppes, therle of Uaudemount, &amp; other noble men
whose names were very tedious to you to here rehersed. And he had in
a gard, aboute his person, thre thousand strong archers, some on horsebacke,
and parte on fote. And as he was commyng, betwene sainct Denice
and Paris, he was met at the Chapell, in the meane waie, by Sir
Simon Moruer prouost of Paris, with a greate company, all clothed
in redde Satin, with blewe whoddes, whiche did to hym, due reuerence
and lowe obeysaunce. After whom, came diuerse riche and notable burgesses,
of the toune of Paris, all appareled in Crimosyne clothe. After
thei had doen their reuerence, there approched to the kyng, the .ix. worthies,

                     •
                  ittyng richely on horsebacke, armed with the armes to them apperteinyng.
Next after them, came the knight of the watche, for the prouost
Marchauntes, and with him, all the officers of the courte, appareled
in blewe, and hattes redde. And in a long space after, came Master
Phillip de Noruillier, chief president of the Parliament, appareled in
a robe of estate: and all the other presidentes of the parliament, clothed
in robes of scarlet, and in like robes folowed the Lordes of the Chamber
of accomptes, and of the finaunce, the Masters of the Requestes,
the secretaries, and Regesters, and euery cōpany, as their course came,
saluted the kyng, with eloquent oracions, and heroicall verses, and so
conueyed hym to the gate of saincte Denice, where the prouoste, of the
Marchauntes, and the Shrefes of the toune, receiued hym with a Canapie
of blewe veluet, richely embraudred, with flower of delices gold,
and bare thesame ouer hym, through the toune, whiche on euery side,
was hanged with riche clothes of Arras and Tapissrie. And at euery
porte and bridge where he passed was set a pageaunt, of greate shewe
and small coste, whiche, because thei were but trifles, I ouer passe, and
speke but of one deuise, made before the gate of the Chastelet, wherevpon
a stage stode, a goodly childe, clothed with habite royall, set full of
flower delices, hauyng two Crounes on his hed, representyng the yong
kyng, and on his right hande, stoode twoo noble personages, in the armes
of Burgoyne and Flaunders: and on the lefte side of hym, stoode
three personages, clothed in the Armes, of Bedforde, Salisbury, and
Warwicke, whiche to hym deliuerd, the swerde of Englande. This pagiaunt
was well regarded, and highly praised. From thence he departed
to the palace, and offered in the Chapell, and from thence he departed,
to the hous of Tournelles, and there toke his repast. And after din-

Isabell, late wife to kyng Charles, his grandfather, long before disceased.
And the next daie he was conueyed, to Boys de Uyncennes, where,
he reposed hymself, till the .xv. day of Decēbre: on whiche daie, he returned
to the palaice of Paris. And on the .xvij. of thesaied moneth, he departed
from the place, in greate triumphe, honorably accompanied, to
our Lady churche of Paris: where, with al solempnitie, he was anoynted
and crouned kyng of Fraunce, by the Cardinal of Winchester: (the
bishop of Paris, not beyng content, that the Cardinal should do suche
a high Ceremony, in his Churche and iurisdiccion.) At the offeryng, he
offred breade and wine, as the custome of Fraūce is. When the deuine
seruise was finished, and all Ceremonies due, to that high estate were
accōplished, the kyng departed toward the palaice, hauyng one croune
on his hed, and another borne before hym, and one scepter in his hand,
&amp; the second borne before hym. What should I speake, of the honorable
seruice, the daintie dishes, the pleasant conceiptes, the costly wines, the
swete Armony, the Musical instrumentes, whiche wer sene and shewed
at that feast, sithe all men maie coniecture, that nothyng was omitted,
that might be bought for golde, nor nothyng was forgotten, that by
mannes witte could be inuented. Yet this high and ioyous feast, was
not without a spotte of displeasure, for the Cardinall of Wynchester,
whiche at this tyme, would haue no man to hym egall, commaunded
the duke of Bedforde, to leaue of the name of Regent, duryng the tyme
that the kyng was in Fraunce: affirmyng the chief ruler beyng in presēce,
the authoritie of the substitute, was clerely derogate: accordyng to
the cōmon saiyng: in the presence of the high power, the smal authoritie
geueth place. The duke of Bedford, toke suche a secret dispeasure with
this dooyng, that he neuer after fauored the Cardinall, but repugned
and disdained at all thynges that he did or deuised. And so because the
Cardinall would haue no temporall Lorde, either to hym superior, or
with hym egall, he set furth this proude and arrogant conclusion, thorowe
whiche vnhappie deuision, the glory of thenglshemen within the
realme of Fraunce, began first to decaye, and vade awaie in Fraunce.
               
                  THE next daie after this solempne feast, wer kept triumphant Iustes
and Turneis, in the whiche, the Erle of Arundell, and the Bastard
of Sent Polle, by the iudgement of the Ladies, wan the price, and gat
the honor. When he had kepte open hous to all comers, by the space of
xx. daies, because the ayre of Paris, was somwhat contrariaunt to his
pure complexion, he was aduised by his counsaill, to returne to Roan.
But before his departure, he caused al the nobilitie, the presidētz of the
parliament, the prouostes of the citee and of the Marchauntes, and the
chief burgesses of the toune and citee, and al the doctors of the vniuersitie,
to be assembled in his presence: to whom the duke of Bedford said
in this maner.
               
                  IT is not vnknowen to you all my lordes,An Oracion of the duke of Bedforde, made to the Parisians. aswell spirituall as temporall,
how this noble region and famous countrey, of antiquitie called

Gaule, and now Fraunce, sithe the tyme of Charles, surnamed the
Greate, beyng bothe Emperor of Rome, and kyng of this realme, hath
been accompted, reputed, and renoumed, the moste christen region, and
famous seigniory, within the circle of al christendō, yea, and within the
whole part of Europe, and not vndeseruyngly, for .iij. causes. First, for
your sincere faithe and obedient loue, toward your sauior and redemer
Iesu Christ. The second, for obseruyng your fidelitie &amp; due obeysaūce,
to your kynges and soueraigne Lordes. Thirdly, for kepyng and performyng
your promises and agrementes, aswell by woorde as by wrytyng:
from the whiche no Pagane, nor honest Christian, will or should
disagree. This famous renoume and immaculate honor, so long continewyng
without reproche or blotte: I thinke, yea, and doubt not, but
you wil to the death, kepe, defend, and obserue, as your noble parentes
and auncient progenitors, before you (to their ineffable praise) haue vsed
and accustomed. Wherfore, sith it is not vnknowen to all you, that
the noble and vertuous prince, kyng Henry the fifth, my moste dearest
and welbeloued brother, was the very true inheritor, and the vndoubt
full successor, to the croune of this realme of Fraūce, as cosin and heire
to Lady Isabell, daughter and sole inheritrice, to kyng Phillippe the
Faire. For the recouery of whiche right and title, what pain he tooke,
and what charge he was at, I well knowe, and some of you haue felte,
as a greate scourge to your nacion, onely prouided by God, to afflicte
and punishe theim: whiche will withhold &amp; vsurpe, other mennes rightes,
possessions, and inheritaunce. But God oure sauior and redemer,
(whiche wil not suffre his people, intendyng to conuert, to be dampned
for euer, but gently calleth them to mercy and saluacion) of his greate
goodnes &amp; gentlenes, willed the holy ghost, to shed and poure, into the
hart of the noble prince, kyng Charles, your late welbeloued and most
drad soueraigne lord, the knowledge of the lawfull line, and of the true
pathe of the inheritaunce, of the croune &amp; scepter of this realme. Whiche
vertuous man, hauyng neither an harte hardened in his awne opinion,
nor a mynd ambicious of Empire, (as many tyrauntes, and couetouse
princes, before this daie, haue had, vsed, and accustomed) for
aduoydyng farther effusion of christen bloud, and for the saluacion of
his soule, without battaill, or stroke of weapon, was content, (vpon an
honorable cōposicion) to restore the lawful inheritaūce to the true heire
and to rendre his title to the right lignage, &amp; vndoubted lyne. Whiche
treatie and final composicion, was nether wantonly ouerloked, nor vnwisely
ouersene. For al the noble peres, of this realme, bothe spiritual &amp;
temporall, yea, &amp; the moste part of the nobilitie, (except a certain wilde
and wilfull persones) with the whole cōmunaltie, (in whō the very base
and burden of the realme doth consist) not onely by worde, but by auncient
writyng, signed with their handes, and strengthened with the seales
of their armes, here redy to be shewed, haue frankly and frely, with
out scruple or contradiccion, agreed, and affirmed thesame. By whiche

composicion, (as the mirror and plain shewe and token, of kyng Henries
right) he was by the three estates, assigned, and allowed, as heire
apparant to thesaid kyng Charles, lately deceassed. But cruell deathe
seperatyng his body from his soule, long before the expectacion of his
people, suffered hym not to possede and enioye, the title and regalitie, of
this his due inheritaunce, and succession royall. Yet, God willyng not
the stocke, of so noble, so famous, and so vertuous a prince, to remayne
bareyn without budde or flower, hath sent to hym, and frō him to you a
florishing child, a godly prince of bothe the noble houses, of England &amp;
Fraunce, indifferently discended: as who would saie, that by nature, he
is neither perfect Englishe, nor perfect Frenche, but a man indifferent,
called an Englishe Frencheman, and a Frenche Englishman. Whiche
noble prince, and your soueraigne Lorde, you maie with glad hartes,
and louyng countenaunces, se, heare, and behold. And as for his honorable
behauor, &amp; princely maiestie: fewe princes of full &amp; ripe age, be to
hym comparable, or equipollent. As for his beautie and other giftes of
nature, scace Absalon can be to hym assembled. But, hauyng respect to
the vertuous disposicion, the Godly mynd, and sincere conscience, of so
noble a child and princely infant, I surely thinke, and perfectly beleue,
that he is aboue all other, the blasyng Starre, and the vnmatched Paragon.
This precious stone and noble Iuell, is not onely come out of
his naturall countrey, and nourishyng Region, to receiue the Croune
and possession, of this his realme and dominion, but also, (like a good
shepeherde) to vieue, se, and knowe you, as his welbeloued flocke, and
moste desired subiectes: and you likewise, (as louyng and obediēt vassals)
to behold, and knowe your soueraigne lorde and prince, to the intent,
that as you, aboue all other nacions, aswel christen as Ethenicke,
haue serued, loued, and obeyed, your rulers and Kynges, before these
daies: so, he now doubteth not, but to find you as louyng to him, as the
Turtle to her make, as sure to hym, as the Adamant to the stele, and as
permanent in his obedience, as the hard mountayne of Olympe, whiche,
neither craft nor engyne can either consume, or remoue. And al mistrust
of your ingratitude, is clerely banished from his harte: consideryng,
that he knoweth, that you daily heare it preched, that you should
feare God, and honor your kyng, and that he, whiche is in stubburnesse
and obstinacie toward his prince, is disobedient towarde God. For the
Prince in yearth, is the Uicar of GOD, and hedde and shepherde of
Christes flocke: to whō bothe spirituall persones and temporal, be subiectes,
and inferiors in al causes of rule &amp; gouernaunce. And although
some persones within this realme, seduced more by phantastical error,
then obstinate arrogancy, haue takē part, and entered into amitie with
Charles de Ualoys, vntruly callyng himself the Frenche kyng: yet the
verie true and vndoubtfull prince, and our souereigne Lorde, here beyng
present, is resolued and content, to remit and pardon their offences
and crimes, so that thei within twelfe daies, returne to the true folde,

and forsake the infected flocke, and sedious company. Wherefore, his
request is at this tyme, that you, for the fidelitie, whiche you haue
euer borne to hym, and for the loue, that he hath, and styll intendeth
to beare to you, will vouchesafe hereafter, without lettyng of tyme, diligētly
study, and busely take pain, bothe to kepe his louyng subiectes
in good ordre, and due obeysaunce towarde hym, and also to se theim
liue in mutuall amitic and brotherly concord, betwene theim selfes: not
forgettyng, that the olde prouerbe, whiche saieth: inward discord, bryngeth
realmes to ruyne. Whiche honorable requestes, if you accōplishe
and performe, (as of your very bounden duety, you be bound in deede)
you shall deserue so muche fauor, of your kyng and soueraigne Lorde,
that to al your honest requestes, his eares shalbe open, &amp; to al your reasonable
desires, his mouthe shall not be stopped. And thus he wissheth
you, healthe in bodies, increase in your substaunce, and to your soules,

                     •
                  oye and felicitie without ende perpetually.
               
                  VVHEN the duke had finished and ended this his oracion, the people
beyng glad and reioysyng at his saiynges, cried; liue kyng Henry▪
liue Kyng Henry. After whiche crie passed, the noble men, aswell of
Fraunce and Normandy, did to hym homage, and the common people▪
sware to hym feaultie: to whom, (although he wer a child) he gaue both
pleasaunt and faire wordes, with hartie thankes, and many gratificacions,
to the greate admiracion of the Frenche people.
               
                  AFTER he had feasted, the nobles and commons of Fraunce, within
the citee of Paris, he with a greate company, departed from thence,
and by small iorneis came to Roan, where, he celebrated with great solempnitie,
the high feast of Christmas. While these noble Ceremonies
wer thus in doyng, in the citee of Paris, sondery chaūces, diuersly hapned
in seueral places, to the displeasure of the one part, and to the gain
of the other. For sir Frances Surrien Arragnoys, a noble capitain in
Normandy, toke by force and pollicie, the toune of Mountarges, with
a greate prey of treasure and prisoners, and therein he put a garrison,
and vitailed the toune, to the greate displeasure of the Frenche Kyng.
Aboute thesame season, the Erle of Arundell, beyng truely informed,
that the lorde Bousac, Marshall of Fraunce, was come to Beauoys,
intendyng to do some feate in Normādy, assembled the nombre of thre
and twentie hundred men, and laied hymself priuelie, in a close place,
nor farre from thesaied toune, and sent a great nombre of light horssemen,
to ronne to the barriers of the citee. The Frenchmen, like valiaūt
men of warre, issued out, and manfully fought with the Englishemen:
whiche sodainly fled, toward the stale. The Frenchmen, coragiously folowed,
thinkyng the game gotten on their side: but when thei wer entered,
into the straight, therle set freshely on them, so that after long fightyng,
there wer slain and taken, in maner al the Frenchmen, saue a few,
whiche fled into the toune, with the Marshall. Emōgest the capitaines
was founde prisoner, the valiaunt capitain, called Poynton of Sanctrailes,

(whiche without delay,) was exchaunged for the lorde Talbot,
before taken prisoner, at the battaill of Patay. There was also taken
one, called the shepherd, a simple mā, and a sely soule, whom, the Frēchmen
reputed, to be of suche a holinesse, that if he touched the walle of a
toune, of their enemies, that incontinent, it would fall to the grounde,
and ouerturne. Suche false phantasticall fainers, were at that tyme
muche regarded, and no lesse beleued in Fraunce.
               
                  THIS chaunce succeded not, fortunatly alone: for Richard Beauchampe
Erle of Warwicke, had a greate skirmishe, before the toune of
Gourney, where he discōfited and repulsed his enemies, and beside the
carions, whiche wer left dedde on the ground, he tooke prisoners, three
score horssemen, all gentlemen of name and armes. Like chaunce of infortune,
happened at thesame tyme, to Renate or Reyne duke of Barr,
a greate frend to Charles the French kyng, bothe in lendyng hym money,
and also in ministeryng to hym aide and succors. This Duke bearyng
displeasure, to Anthony Erle of Uaudemont, his cosyn and kynsman,
gathered together a greate armie, and besieged the toune of Uaudemont.
Therle, before the dukes approchyng, to thentent y• he would
not be enclosed and compassed about by his enemies within a wal, leauyng
behynde hym, a conuenient crue of men of warre, to defende the
toune for a tyme, with al diligēce rode to the dukes of Bedford &amp; Burgoyne,
beyng then at the greate triumphe at Paris, whose part he had
euertaken, After long consultacion, it was agreed that sir Ihon Fastolffe,
should go with hym, hauyng in his company sixe hundred Archers,
and the duke of Burgoyne sent to hym, his Marshall, called sir
Anthony Doulongon, with .xv. hundred men. The elre of Uaudemont
thus beyng accompanied, marched toward his enemies. Duke Reine,
hearyng of his commyng towarde hym, was somewhat dismayed, fearyng,
least if his enemies should approche to the walles, and be espied
by the garrison within the toune, that, at one tyme he should be assailed
before, by them that would issue out of the toune, and behind, by therle
and his armie. Wherfore, like a hardy capitain, he brake vp his siege,
and met face to face, with therle and his company: betwene whom, was
a cruell and a mortall battaill. The horsemen indured long, but in conclusion,
the Englishe Archers, so galled the horses and so wounded the
men, that the Barroys and their frendes, wer cōpelled to flie: in whiche
chace was taken, thesaied duke of Barr, the bishop of Myes, the lorde
of Rodemaque, sir Euerard of Saseabery, the Uicoūt Darcy, and two
hundred other, beside thre thousande men, whiche were slaine. In this
lucky tyme also, no lesse occasion of victory, was offred to the Englishmen,
beyng in another parte, if, wh
                     •
                  n the pigge had been profered, thei
had opened the poke: for Robert, Lorde Willoughby, and Mathew
Gough a valiaunt Welsheman, with .xv. hundred Englishemen, laied
siege to a toune in Aniow, beyng bothe by situacion, and pollicie, verie
strong, and defensible, called sainct Seueryne. The Englishmen assailed

it not so coragiously, but thei within, with egall audacitie, boldely
made defence: so that fortune semed, to waie bothe the parties in egall
balaūce. Charles the French kyng, beyng thereof aduertised, sent with
all spede, the lorde Ambrose de Lore, with many noble and valiaūt personages,
to aide and releue his frendes, inclosed in the toune by his
enemies. This lorde de Lore, beyng capitain of the toune, made muche
haste to comfort his deputie and capitain within thesame, and so marched
forward with greate spied: but fearyng to be sodainly compassed
aboute, he taried still at Beaumont, lokyng for the armie and capitaines,
that should folow, and then altogether to set on their enemies, and
so to reyse the siege. Whiles he there made his abode, and toke his leysure,
the Englishemen, by their espialles, were assertened and aduertised,
what progresse their enemies made, and what thei intended▪ Wherfore,
thei pollitiquely prouided, to fight with the one parte, before the
whole puyssaunce wer ioyned. And so a greate parte of theim, departed
secretly in the night, toward their enemies, and found the watch so out
of ordre, and ouersene, that a thousande men wer entered into the camp
before thei were espied. But the slaiyng of men, and cuttyng doune of
tentes, awaked the capitaines, whom this sodain feare, and vnlooked
chaunce, so greately abashed, that no man in maner, either could h
                     •
                  are
his felow or hymself, or could make signe to expulse and driue out their
enemies out of their campe. But when the day beganne to appere, and
the sonne had setfurth his bright beames, that all thyng might be sene
and perceiued, the Englishmen, geuen to couetuousnes of spoyle, and
desire of Rauyne, neither chaced, nor folowed their enemies, but beyng
content with their prey and gayne, began to retraite toward the siege
again. But se the chaunce: the Frenchmen whiche wer commyng after,
heard by the noyce of the people, that some fraie was then in hand, put
the spurres to the horse, and 
                     •
                  et on their enemies, beyng laded with bagges
and wallettes, of preys and spoiles. The other part, whiche before
fled, returned again, and assailed their enemies. The Frenchmen egerly
assailed, and the Englishemen manfully defended, whiche beyng out
of ordre, wer compelled to flie, of whom, Matthew Gough and diuerse
other wer taken prisoners, and yet of the other parte, many were slain,
and a great nombre taken, emongest whom, was the lord of Lore, whiche,
for all the battaile, was kept and not deliuered.
               
                  THE lorde Willoughby, hearyng of this chaunce, reysed the siege &amp;
departed, verie sore displeased. Therefore, let euery capitain take good
hede of victorie, the whiche as she is harde to obtain, so she is quicke to
flie awaie: for it is daily sene, that he, whiche thynketh suerly, that he
hath her in his handes, before he can catche her, is deceiued, &amp; ronneth
into a great losse and daūger: and on the otherside, when she is gotten,
(except good watche be hourely kept) she will steale awaie, with muche
hurte and detriment, to the first gainer. Thus the Englishmen, for the
gredy appetite of gain, lost the triumphaunt victorie, whiche thei had

in their handes. While the Englishe and Frenche nacions, thus stroue
and contended, for preeminence, principalitie, yea, &amp; for the superior power
of life, by the vnreasonable rage of warre in Fraunce, the rich men
were spoyled of their goodes, the spirituall persones, were taxed and
brought low, the cōmon people wer slain, murdred, and trode vnder the
foote, women wer defiled, virgyns wer rauished, tounes wer destroied
and wasted, toune dwellers and citezens, wer robbed and exiled, beautiful
buyldynges, wer cruelly brent, nothyng was spared, by the crueltie
of Mars: whiche by fire, bloud, or famyne, might be catched or destroied,
beside a hūdred more calamities, that daily vexed and troubled
the miserable French nacion. Although Fraūce, wer at this tyme, thus
miserablie aflicted: yet Englande, was not without doloure and trouble:
for daily Englishmen, aswel noble as meane personages, wer slain
taken, wounded, or hurte, their substaunce was cōtinually exacted, and
cōsumed for maintenaunce of the warres, so that mischief and calamitie
was indifferent to bothe the nacions, and quietnes and gayne, were
expulsed &amp; banished from them both: in so muche that the lamentacion
and dolor of bothe the coūtries, wer heard through the whole west part
of the worlde, and of their continual discencion, al Europe and Affrike,
had their eares and mouthes ful, so that all men, not onely marueiled,
that Fraūce could so muche trouble so long time sustain, but more wō
                  dered,
that the realme of Englande, beyng but an Isle, was able so to
scourge, plague and trouble, the large French region, for whiche cause
Euginye the fourth, beyng bishopp of Rome, intendyng to bryng this
cruel warre, to a frendly peace, sent his Legate, called Nicolas, Cardinall
of the holy crosse, into Fraunce, to thentent to make an amitie, and
a concord betwene the two Princes and their realmes. This wise Cardinall,
came first to the Frenche kyng, and after to the duke of Bedford
beyng at Paris: exhortyng concord, and persuadyng vnitie, shewyng,
declaryng, and arguyng, peace to be moste honorable, and more profitable
to Christian princes, then mortall warre, or vncharitable discencion.
Which gouernors of Christes people, ought to haue an iye, to the
profite of their people, to se Iustice duly ministred, to rule thēselfes by
reason and not by wil, and to abstain frō malice, and abhorre al wrong
and iniury, to whiche thynges, warre is euer enemie &amp; cleane contrary.
               
                  VVHEN the Legate had thus persuaded the princes on euery part,
bothe, gently aunswered, that thei wer content to come, to a reasonable
ende. But when the first communicacion was moued, and by cōmissioners
treated, their dooynges wer so farre disagreable, from their wordes,
that not onely reasonable and honest condicions of peace, could be
neither heard nor accepted, but more frowardnes, pertinacie, &amp; malice,
was kindeled and sprong in their stomackes, then before that time had
been sene. The Cardinal beyng in vtter dispaire, of cōcludyng a peace
betwene the twoo realmes, (least he should seme to departe empty of all
thynges, for the whiche he had taken so muche trauaill) desired a truce

for sixe yeres to come, which request, as it was to him, by bothe parties
hardly graunted, so was it of the Frenchmen, sone and lightly broken,
after his returne: For the Bastarde of Orleaunce, newly made Erle of
Dumoys, tooke by treason the toune of Charters, from the Englishemen:
affirmyng by the lawe of armes, that stealyng or biyng a toune,
without inuasiō, or assaute, was no breach of league, amitie, nor truce.
In the whiche toune, he slewe the bishop, because he was a Burgonyō,
through whiche occasion, newe malice increased, and mortal warre began
again, to rise and spryng.
               
                  VVHILE these thynges wer doyng in Fraunce, Henry Beaufforde
Cardinall of Winchester, was sailed again into Englande, to appea
                     •
                  e
and represse certain diuisions and commocions, sprong vp, by mischeuous
and pernicious persones, within the realme, whiche vnder the colour
of a newe sect of religion, coniured together, to disquiet &amp; vexe, the
whole quietnes of the realme. But after, that Williā Maundeuile and
Ihō Sharpe wer taken, and executed by the gouernor and the kynges
Iustices, the remnaunt yelded, and cōfessed their offences: wherof two
articles wer these, as some men write: that priestes should haue no possessions,
and that all thynges, by the ordre of Charitie, emongest Christen
people, should be incommon. After this sedicious coniuracion, by
diligent enquirie, was thus quēched out, the Cardinall began to commen
with the duke of Gloucester, concernyng the affaires and busines
of Fraunce: and suspecting that the truce would not long continue betwene
bothe y• realmes, (as it did not in dede) diuised, how to send more
aide, and men to the Duke of Bedforde, and gathered vp more money,
and treasure, for the further maintenaūce of the warres, and resistence
of their enemies. Wherupon the Duke of Gloucester, called a Parliament,
in the whiche, money was assigned, and men wer appointed. Duryng
whiche Parliament, Iames the kyng of Scottes, sent Ambassadors,
to conclude a peace, with the duke of Gloucester, whiche, (because
the kyng was abs
                     •
                  nte) referred the matter to the iij. estates. After long
consultacion, (not without greate argumentes) a peace was graunted
and concluded, whiche all men iudged, long to continue, because kyng
Iames, was then vexed, with ciuil warre and intestine discencion, and
also the Frenchemen had taken truce, (as you haue hard) for .vi. yeres.
               
                  VVHEN the parliament was finished, the cardinall wel garnished
with men and money, departed out of Englande, and came to Roan to
the kyng, to whom also resorted from Paris, Iohn, Duke of Bedford,
to debate and consult of thynges, not vnlikely to happen and chaunce.
Wherfore, a greate counsail was celebrate, within the Castle of Roan,
and many doubtes wer moued, and fewe waighty thynges out of hand
concluded. Some imagined, that their enemies, would not long kepe
promise, nor yet obserue the truce, by them solemply graunted: consideryng,
that the Frenche hartes brente, and their iyes were very sore, to se
the riche Duchie of Normandy, the faire citee of Paris, and the pleasaunt

Isle of Fraunce, to be brought and reduced, vnder the obeysaūce
and subieccion, of thenglish nacion. Wherfore, thei would not omit, or
ouerse one thyng, that soūded to defence, least the Frenchmen sodainly,
(not keping their promes, &amp; brekyng the truce,) might cause thenglishmen to be in greate &amp; perilous ieoperdy, not knowyng what coūsaill to
take, nor sodainly to prouide a remedy for a mischief, bothe for lacke of
men and substaunce. Other wer of opinion, that nombres of men, could
not long be maintained and kepte together, without breache of truce,
and violatyng of peace: knowyng that the handes of men, be properly
geuen to spoyle, and euer redy to gain, and moste especially, when thei
be daily redy in harneis, prone and quicke to set on their enemies. And
therfore, thei would the walled tounes, to be wel manned and defēded,
and the rest of the army, to be sent into England again, there to remain
and tary, til the tyme of the truce wer expired and ouer passed.
               
                  AFTER this disputacion, with many argumētes ended, the dukes
of Bedford and Yorke, and Edmond late erle of Mortayn, and now by
the death of Ihon duke of Somerset, (whiche died without heire male,
leauing behind hym, a sole doughter called Margaret, after, countesse
of Richemōd) erected to the name and title, of duke of Somerset, liked
and approued, the first argument, &amp; first moued reason: affirmyng best,
that warre must be prouided for, and that money out to be disburssed,
and to aduoyde all doubtes, that a greater army, was necessary to be
gathered together and assembled. When al thynges wer agreed, kyng
Henry departed to Calice, and from thence to Douer, and so by easye
torneis he came the .xxi. daie of February, to the citee of London, where
he was receiued, not onely with greate pompe and triumphe, but also
highly presented with giftes and money, as in the Chronicle of Robert
Fabian, you maie rede at large, whiche thyng I ouer passe.
               
                  AFTER that the kyng, was departed into Englande, the Duke of
Bedford, Regent of Fraunce, and capitain of Calice, taried behynde in
the Marches of Picardy: where he was informed, that certain souldiors
of Calice, grudgyng at the restraint of wolles, beganne to mutter
and murmure against the kyng and his counsaill, so that the toune of
Calice, was like to stand in ieoperdy. Wherfore the duke, forseyng the
mischief that might insue, &amp; thinkyng it wisedom, to withstand the first
mocion, caused the chieftaynes of this faccion, to be apprehended, and
after due examinacion had, diuerse were put to death, and many banished
&amp; exiled the Marches for euer. After that he had purged the toune
of that vngracious and sedicious company, and had furnished it, with
new souldiors &amp; discrete men of war, he was determined, first to repaire
again to Paris, but his harte would not serue hym: for sith his departure,
Lady Anne his wife and Duchies, was departed to God, and honorably
enterred in the Celestyns at Paris: by whose death, and for other
causes, (as partely you haue hard) the sure loue, and approued fidelitie,
betwene the duke of Burgoyn, his brother in lawe and hym, began

to waxe fainte and colde. For whiche cause, he, beyng persuaded by
the lorde Lewes of Luxenborough, bishoppe of Tyrwine and Ely, and
Chauncellor of Fraunce for kyng Henry, agreed to marye the Lady
Iaquet, doughter to Peter, Erle of sainct Paule, and nicce to the saied
bishop, and to lorde Ihon of Luxenborough: to the intent, that by this
newe affinitie, the olde acquaintaunce and familiaritie, whiche he had
with that noble familie of Luxēborough, should be reneued and inforced,
and with a more surer knot, knit and confirmed. Wherupon, he departed
from Calice to Tirwyne, where, he was highly receiued of the
Erle of sainct Paule, and of his brethren, and there he maried, the faire
and freashe lady Iaquet, of the age of .xvii. yeres, with all triumphe
and nup
                     •
                  iall solempnitie. After whiche Ceremony ended, he returned
with his newe spouse to Calice, and so into Englande, where, he with
his wife remained, vntil August next, and then returned again to Paris.
The duke of Burgoyne, (whose mynde began to incline, a litle and
litle, toward kyng Charles) was sore greued and angry, that the duke
of Bedforde, was ioyned in affinitie, with the noble and famous hous
of Luxēborough: by the whiche he sawe, that the power of the Englishmen,
should be greatly aduaunced. But the mariage was fully ended,
and he could finde no remedy.
            
            
               ¶The eleuenth yere.The .xi. yere.
               
               
                  WHile these thynges were doyng thus, in other places
the French souldiors lackyng wages, (and emōgest
theim, a greate nombre, whiche in hope of prey, and
desire of spoile, had cast vp the plough, and left their
labor,) began priuely, (as tyme serued, and occasion
gaue place) to take bothe Englishmen and Burgonyons,
and raunsomed and spoyled theim, at their
pleasures. And although, thei were prohibited thus to do, (duryng the
time of truce &amp; peace) yet inconclusion, thei spared not, openly to robbe,
spoyle, and burne: yea, &amp; to steale tounes, whiche thei affirmed to be no
breache of truce. The Englishemen, pricked and vexed, with these open
wronges, and manifest iniuries, prepared for warre, after the sixe moneth,
that the truce was taken and concluded. And by this meanes, the
war was reneued and begonne again. The vntrue Frenchemen, breakers
of peace, and not kepers of truce, reysed a crewe of men, and sodainly
tooke the toune of sainct Ualerie, standyng in Normandy, on the
Riuer of Soame: and another army, vnder the cōduict of sir Ambrose,
lorde of Lore, wasted and destroyed all the countrey aboute Caen. The
Duke of Bedford, not myndyng to lie still in ydlenesse, sent the Erle of
Arundell, the Erle of Warwickes sonne the Lorde Lisle, Adane Marshall
of Fraunce, for kyng Henry, and .xii.C. men, with ordinaunce and
municions, to besiege the toune of Laigny, vpon the Riuer of Marne.
Wh
                     •
                  che Erle, with the shot of a Canon, brake the arche of the bridge,

and gat from the Frenchmen, their bulwarke, and set it on fire. Diuerse
assautes were attempted, but the toune was well defended: for within,
wer shut vp, eight hūdred men of armes, beside other meane souldiors.
               
                  THE duke of Bedford, beyng therof aduertised, gathered an armie
of sixe thousande men of warre, whereof wer capitaines, Robert, Lorde
Willoughby, sir Andrewe Ogard, Chamberlein to the duke, sir Ihon
Saluaine, Baylife of Roan, sir Ihon Montgomerie, Bailife of Caux,
sir Phillip Halle, Baylife of Uernoyle, sir Richard Ratclife, deputie of
Calice, sir Raufe Neuell, sir Raufe Standishe, sir Ihon Hanforde, sir
Richard Euthin, sir Richard Harryngton, Bailife of Eurenx, sir William
Fulthorpe, sir Thomas Griffyne of Irelande; Dauy Halle, Thomas
Stranguish, Leonard Ornestō, Esquiers, and Thomas Gerard,
whiche solde the toune of Mounstrean Faultyon, to the Frenchemen:
and with all thynges necessarye, came to the siege before Laigny. He,
there, made a bridge of boates, and brought his ordinaunce so nere the
toune, that to all people, it semed not long able to resist. But the Erle
of Dumoys Bastard of Orleaunce, with diuer
                     •
                  e hardy capitaines, as
valiauntly repulsed, as the Englishemen assauted. This siege contyneued,
as fire against flame, and sometyme flame against fire. For although
the Englishemen slewe more nombre, yet thei gat neither prey,
nor boty: and although the Frenchemen, kepte valeauntly the walles,
and defended the loupes, yet thei loste bothe men and capitaines, and
wer long secluded from their aide and succors, til Charles the Frenche
kyng, perceiuyng this toune, to be the thre corner key, betwene the territories
of the Englishemen, the Burgonyons, and his awne, and that
the losse therof, should turne hym to innumerable damages, and incredible
hurtes, sent the lorde of Rieux, Poyton, the Heire, the lorde Gancort,
and sixe thousand men, with great plentie of vitailes, to thentent,
either to reise the siege, or to vitaile the toune. The French capitaines,
made a bragge, as though thei would fight with thenglishemen, within
their felde and Campe. The Englishemen would not issue out, but
kept themselfes in good ordre, euer lokyng for, their entrie and inuasiō.
The Regent perceiuyng, that thei approched not, sente to theim an herault
of Armes, declaryng his intent, and the corage of his company,
whiche nothyng more desired, then battaill. And to shewe hymself as a
capitain, meanyng that, which he offred, &amp; not dissimulyng that, whiche
he spake: he incontinent, diuided his men into three battailes, no more
wisely ordered, the pollitiquely gouerned: as who would saie, come on
Frencheman, if thy harte will serue. But his aduersaries, more craftie
then hardy, more pollitique then coragious, framed themselfes in suche
ordre of battaile, as thei wer able to do all thyng, and yet inconclusion,
(concernyng marciall feates) thei did nothyng. For, while thei made a
proude bragge, and a stoute skirmishe with the Englishemen, thei appoynted
diuerse rude and rusticall persones, to conueye into the toune,
xxx. oxē and other small vitaill, but this swete gain, was sowerly paied

for, if the losse with the gain, be pondered in one balaunce: for hauyng
regard to .xxx. leane oxen, in the conflict were slain, the lorde Sentrayles,
brother to Pothon, the valeaunt capitain Ihon, brother to the lord
Gawcort, and fiftie other noble and valeaunt personages, besid other
common people, whiche bought that bargayne, about the price of the
common Markette. The Frenchemen, perceiuyng their infortunate
chaunce, and not only consyderyng, the vnspekeable heate, whiche then
weried their people, beyng in the beginnyng, of the hote moneth of August:
but also, perceiuyng the Englishmen, to be planted and settled, in
a place vnable to be wonne, and in a grounde, bothe daūgerous to inuade,
and hard to assaile, like men desperate of gain, and without hope
of victory, departed to Fort vnder Yerre, where, by a bridge of tunnes,
thei passed into the Isle of Fraunce. The Duke of Bedforde, (like a
wise prince) not myndyng to lease the more for the lesse, nor the accident
for the substaunce, fearyng that Paris and other tounes, more necessary
to thenglishemen, and of more estimacion, would returne to his aduersaries,
thynkyng if the greater power were holden, the lesse should
be sone obtained, reysed his siege, and returned to Paris, nothyng lesse
myndyng, then to trie his querell with dent of sweard, against his enemies:
and so sent Bedford his herault, to the lorde Gamcort, and other
chieftaines of his army, offeryng hym battail, and a pitched feld, within
a conuenient grounde▪ where so euer he would, within the Isle of
Fraunce, assigne or appoynt. To the whiche officer of Armes, the capitaines
aunswered, that battaill thei feared not, nor the Englishe puyssaunce,
thei not muche regarded, but thei saied: that tyme was to gain,
and tyme was to lose, of the whiche twoo, thei doubted not to espie the
one, either to their greate gain, or to their apparaunt losse. Wherupon
thei sent the lorde Ambrose de Lore, with .vii.C. horsemen, to robbe and
spoyle the poore people, commyng to the faier, on the day of sai
                     •
                  ct Michaell
the Archangell, kepte in the suburbes of the toune of Cae
                     •
                  . But
whē Dauy Halle Esquier, capitain of the toune, for the duke of Yorke,
issued out to fight with hym, he departed by flight, without any either
botie or gain of the faier. The Frenchmen perceiuyng, that neither power,
force, nor pollicie, could auaile against the Englishe nacion, determined
to trippe and deceiue them, by their accustomed seruaunt, called
master Treason, and so by money, corrupted Piers Audebeuffe, Constable
of the castle of Roan, that the Marshall of Fraunce, and the lord
Fountaynes, with twoo hundred persones disguised, entered into the
Castle, but thei wer sone espied, and driuen to the dongeon, where thei
wer taken and yelded: wherof some wer hanged, some hedded, and some
raunsomed at the pleasure of the Regent: and suche ende had the traytors,
whiche would by treason, rather then by battaill, obtained their
prey and desired purpose.
               
                  THIS pageaunt plaied, the Regent sent Peter of Luxenborough
Erle of sainct Paule, and Robert, lorde Willoughby, with a competēt

crue of men, to besige the toune of Sainct Ualerie, whiche the Frenche
men alitle before had taken. These valeaunt capitaines, not myndyng
to slepe their busines, enuironed the toune with a strong siege. Within
the toune, wer sir Lewes de Uancort, sir Phillippe de la Toure, and sir
Reignold de Uerseilles, capitaines, with three hundred good fightyng
men, which by the space of iii. wekes, manfully defended thesame. But
at the .xxi. daie, thei perceiuyng the fiersenes of thenglishemen, and the
weakenes of themself
                     •
                  s, (hauyng no hope of relief, nor confidence in any
aide) rendered the toune, their horsse and harneis onely saued. The
Erle put, in the garrison of the toune, freashe and valeaunt souldiors,
and appoynted capitain there, sir Ihon Awbemorid: in whiche toune
sodainly, (whether it wer by infecciō of the ayre, or by corrupt vitail by
long liyng, whiche the tounes men did eate,) a great pestilence sprang,
in the infortunate coūtrey. Whiche, after so many calamities and euill
chaunces, beyng twoo tymes besieged by the Frenchemen, and thryse
recouered by thenglishe nacion, was now infected and corrupted, with
the pestilent plague: whereby twoo partes of the people, within shorte
space, wer destroyed and consumed.
               
                  AFTER this toune gotten, the Erle of sainct Paule, and the Lorde
Willoughby, returned to the Regent, where, thei wer well welcomed.
And after, thesaid Erle departed from Paris, to laie siege to the Castle
of Monchas, but beyng encamped, nere to the toune of Blangy, he, by
a sodain maladie, finished his daies, and departed the worlde, leauyng
his seigniories, to Lewes his sonne and heire. For whiche dedde Erle,
wer solempne obsequies kepte, bothe in Paris and in London, because
he was father in lawe to the Regent. In the meane season, the Frenchemen
entered into the costes of high Burgoyne, and brent, toke, and destroyed
tounes: for whiche cause, the Burgonyons beyng sore displeased,
assembled a greate army, bothe to reuenge their querels, and also
to recouer again the tounes, from theim iniustely taken: to whom, (as
to his frendes) the duke of Bedforde, sent Robert Lorde Willoughby,
and sir Thomas Kiriel, with a conuenient company of souldiors, whiche
enteryng into the laundes of La
                     •
                  noys, wer encoūtred with a great
nōbre of their enemies: but by whose force, (after long fight) the French
men wer slain and dispersed: wherof wer left dedde in the feld, an hundred
and sixtie horsemen, beside prisoners, whiche after in a fury, wer al
killed and put to destruccion.
            
            
               ¶The .xii. yere.The .xii. yere.
               
               
                  WHile these chaunces thus happened in Fraunce, Ihō lord
Talbot, gathered together, a crue of chosen men of war in
England, to the nombre of viii.C, &amp; sailed into Normandy,
and passed by Roan toward Paris, and in his way, he
toke the strong Castle of Ioing, betwene Beauoys and
Gisors, and caused all the Frenchmen within, to be hanged on the walles,

and after, raised and defaced the Castle, and came to the Duke of
Bedford, to Paris. The presence of which renoumed capitain, (a maruelous
thyng it is to se) so incoraged the hartes of the English nacion,
that thei thought, nothyng able to resist their puyssaunce, and so discoraged
the hartes of the Frenchemen, that thei wer in doubt, whether it
wer better to fight, or to flie. And this was not without a cause: for surely,
he was a chosen capitain, &amp; in marcial feates, a man fully instructed,
and his corage and practise in warre, was fearfull to the Frenche
nacion, and to his awne coūtremen, an especial hope and a sure defence.
When this hardy Baron, had commoned with the Regent, and agreed
what waie he should take, without long delay or prolongyng of tyme,
he departed from Paris with his army, and desieged the Castle of Beaumont
vpon Oise, wherof was capitain, sir Amadour de Uignolles,
brother to the Heire. Whiche castle was sone rendered, vpon condiciō.
After that, he regained without long siege, the tounes of Creile, the
bridge of sainct Maxens, the new toune in Esinoy, Crespy in Ualoys,
and Cleremoūt in Beauoys: and so with greate riches, and fatte prisoners,
he returned again to Paris. Thus, prosperous successe happened,
not to the lorde Talbot alone: but also thesame very season, therle
of Arundell, toke the Castle of Bomelyne, and raised it to the ground,
and after, tooke by force the Castle of Dorle, and from thence came to
sainct Seleryne, where the lorde Ambrose of Lore, was capitain, whiche
issued out, and fought with the Englishemen so egerly at the firste,
that he droue theim backe an arowe shot by fine force. But the Erle so
incoraged his men, that thei toke newe corages to them, and set to fiersly
on the Frenchemen, that thei slewe a greate nombre, and droue the
remnaunt into the toune.
               
                  AFTER this victory, he besieged Louiers, wherof was capitain, the
Heire, and his brother, whiche rendered the toune, without stroke or assaute.
For all this good lucke, therle forgat not to returne, to the toune
of S. Seleryne, but assembled a great army, and enuironed the toune
about with a strong siege. Whē he had lien there almoste .iij. monethes
euery daie attemptyng or dooyng somewhat, for the performaunce of
his enterprise, in conclusion at the thre monethes ende, he gaue so fierce
an assault, that by force he entred the toune, and slewe Ihon Allemagne
and Gulliam sent Aubyne, the chief capitaines, and .viij.C. other men
of warre, and the Children of the lorde Lore, wer taken captiues: he replenished
and fortified the toune again with newe men, and municiōs,
and made there capitain, sir Ihon Cornwale. Whiche act thus accomplished,
he departed, and came before the strong toune of Sillye, and
there pitched his campe. The inhabitauntes of thesame, somewhat dismaied
with the chaunce, that late happened to the toune of. S. Seleryne,
deliuered to him pledges, vpon this condicion: that if thei wer not
rescued, within .xxx. daies nexte insuyng, then thei, (their lifes saued)
should rendre the toune, into his possession: whiche offre was taken.

The capitaines within the toune, sent a post to the French kyng, to aduertise
hym of their hard chaunce, whiche incontinent sent to them, Arthur,
Erle of Richemond, (but after some writers, Ihon, duke of Alaun
son) with a greate company of men. When therle sawe the Frenche succors
appere, he restored again y• pledges to the gouernors of the toune,
and issued out of his campe, takyng a place moste mete and conuenient
for to abide battaill, for whiche he sore thirsted and longed. The Duke
or the Erle, (take whiche you list) liying by a brooke side, whiche a man
might stride ouer, seyng the Englishemen, so warlike and strongly embattailed,
thought it not for his profite, to geue battaill, or to sette forward:
but in the dedde time of the night, cowardly fled, and with shame
returned: although some Frēche writers affirme, that he loked that the
erle of Arundell, should haue geuen hym battaill, and because he profered
not forward, therfore the Frenchmen departed. This appereth to
be an apparaunt lye, and a Frenche bragge: for if thei came to rescewe
the toune, why did not thei geue battaill, &amp; so driue away thenglishmen
from the toune? If thei came to fight, why departed thei without any
stroke striken? But it semeth that thei came, to make a French face, and
for to do nothyng. For thei, without skirmishe or succoryng the toune,
departed in the night secretly, (as you haue hearde.) When thei within
the toune knew, that their succors failed, thei rendred themselfes, to the
mercy of therle of Arundel, which gently receiued thē, &amp; leauyng a garrison
in the toune, departed to Mauns, and in the meane waie, toke the
Castles, of Mellay and sainct Laurēce. About this tyme, the lord Willoughby,
and sir Thomas Kiriell, returnyng with great victories out
of the parties of Burgoyne, tooke in their waie, the toune of Louiers,
and furnished it, bothe with men, and municions.
               
                  EMONGEST so many good chaunces, some euill are accustomed
to fall and happen, or els the gayners, will not knowe themselfes. So
it happened, that a greate nōbre, of rude and rustical persones in Normādy,
dwellyng by y• sea coast, either prouoked, or intised therunto, by
the Frenche kyng, or desirous of alteracion and chaūge, (whiche thyng
the commen people muche couete and desire) made an insurreccion, and
put on harneis, &amp; by force expulsed certain garrisōs, out of their houldes,
and toke certain tounes: publishyng and proclaimyng opēly, that
their onely purpose and intent was, to expel and banish, the whole Englishe
nacion, out of their coūtreys and coastes. Wherfore, it maie euidently
appere, that the blacke Ethyopian, or the blacke coloured rauē,
wil soner turne their colours, that the vniuersal people, bred in Fraūce
will hartely loue, or inwardly fauor, an Englishe borne child. And yet,
the Normans of long tyme, louyngly and gentely, haue obeyed to the
subieccion of Englande, and haue of the Englishe nacion, been wel accepted
and regarded, but now thei, forgettyng their duetie, and remē
                  bryng
their hurtes, did not doubt, to rebell against their prince and soueraigne
Lorde.
               
                  
                  THIS mischeuous cōpany, thus frantiquely gathred together, with
all spede marched toward Caen, to the intent there, bothe to assemble a
greater nombre of people, and also to consult, what way thei should folow
in their newe begon attēptate. But the dukes of Yorke &amp; Somerset,
whiche then wer liyng in Normandy, hearyng of this vngracious
faccion &amp; troubelous cōmocion, &amp; hauyng knowledge by their espials
what iorney thei intended to take: incōtinent without delay, sent therle
of Arundell, and the lorde Willoughby, with .vj.M. archers, and .xiij.
hundred light horsses, to staie and kepe them, either for settyng furthe,
or makyng farther progresse. Therle of Arundell goyng one waie, appoynted
the Lorde Willoughby, with twoo thousande Archers, and a
certain nombre of horsemen, to go afore hym, to lye in watche and stale,
secretly by the waie, to stop the iorney and passage of the rebelles, whē
thei should approch. The lorde Willoughby, couertly couered hymself
and his company, sendyng worde to the Erle, of the place where he lay,
to thentent that he might make a signe and a token, (when tyme should
be most luckey and fortunate,) to inuade &amp; set on their enemies. Whiche
thyng doen, therle folowed at the backe, the ragged route and mischeuous
multitude, as a man, that draue the deare before him into the
buckestalle, or the sely coneis into the secrete hay. When the ignoraunt
multitude, approched nere to the place of the stale, the Erle made a token,
and shot a gonne for a signe. Then the Lorde Willoughby, set on
them before, and the Erle behynde, shotyng so fiersly, that the dastarde
people, partly, amased with the sodain chaunce, and partly, galled and
wounded with the shot of the arrowes, threwe awaie their harneis: desiryng
nothing but death. Therle of Arundel, (moued with compassiō)
caused his souldiors to leaue of &amp; staye, from farther murther or bloud
sheding, &amp; apprehendyng such, as he thought, to be the ledars and chief
stirrers of the people, let the other returne home frankly &amp; frely: but yet
there were a .M. and more slain, before the souldiors, could be brought
again vnder their standerdes.
               
                  AFTER this commocion appeaced, and the sodain rage in the beginnyng
staied and brideled, diligēt inquirie was made of the malefactors,
and suche as wer found gilty, by diuerse terrible execucions, (accordyng
to their desertes,) miserably ended their traiterous lifes. Duryng
whiche rebellion, Peter Rokefort and his cōpany, gat by treason
the toune of Deape, &amp; diuerse other houldes, therunto adioynyng. After
the Erle of Arundell, had obtained so many conquestes, and notable
victories (as you haue heard) he attempted another, which was the
last worke and extreme labor, of his liuyng daies. For the duke of Bed
ford, beyng informed, that his aduersaries, had sodainly surprised &amp;
takē the toune of Rue, and therin had put a garrison, which sore vexed
the coūtreis of Ponthiew, Arthoys, and Bolenoys, sent word to therle,
that he, without delaye, should besiege thesaid toune. Therle obeyed to
his cōmaundement, and incontinent, sente for all the people vnder his

gouernaunce, &amp; in his marchyng forward, came to Gourney, where he
heard tel, how y• there was a certain Castle, nere Beauoys, called Gerborye,
whiche either by force of rasyng, or violence of weather, was sore
decaied and defaced. And because this place was opportune and very
necessarie, to prohibite, let and stop thenglishmen, to make sodain runnynges
in, or rodes into the countrey of Beauoys: Charles the Frēche
kyng commaunded sir Stephen de Ueignolles, commonly called the
Heire, to se the castle reedefied and fortified. Thesaid sir Stephen with
a greate company, came to the grounde, and lackyng neither stuffe necessary,
nor artificers sufficient, in small tyme erected the Castle, and
began to defend the fortresse. The erle of Arundell, beyng crediblie informed
of their dooynges, and perceiuyng that this newe edificacion,
was very preiudicial to the Englishe part, determined first to take the
Castle, supposyng litle or no resistence, therein to be shutte vp, but he
was deceiued, for there was the Heire, with many good and valeaunte
capitaines. The Erle with fiue hundred horsmen, encamped hymself in
a litle close, nor farre from the Castle: the Frenchemen, whiche wer thre
thousande men, perceiuyng that the Erle and his horses wer wery, and
that his archars wer not yet come, determined for their aduauntage to
set on him, before the cōmyng of his footemen, whiche thei knewe to be
litle more, then a mile behynd the Erle. Wherfore, for a pollicie, thei set
furthe fiftie horssemen, as though there were no mo in the Castle. The
Erle perceiuyng that, sent furth sir Randolfe Standishe, to encountre
with them, hauyng in his company a hundred horsses: the Frenchemen
fought coragiously a while, and sodainly came out all the remnaunte,
and slewe sir Randolfe Standishe, and all his company, and boldly set
on the Erle and his bande, whiche manfully defended them, so that the
Frenchmen gat litle aduauntage, for al their great nombre. The Heire
perceiuyng the hartes, corage and defence of the Englishe people, caused
thre Culuerynes to be shot emongest theim, whereof, one strake the
Erle on the ancle, and so brake his legge, that for pain he fell from his
horsse, then the Frenche men entered emongest the Englishe army, and
tooke the erle, beyng on the grounde, prisoner, and sir Richard Wooduile,
and sixe score more, and there wer slain almoste twoo C. The remnaunt
saued them selfes aswell as thei might. The Erle was caried to
Beauoys, wher, of this hurte he shortly died, and was buried in the friers
Minors. He was a man of a singuler vertue, constancie and grauitie,
whose death in so troubelous a worlde, did sore appall the hartes of
his nacion. By this infortune, Rue was not besieged, nor Gerborie taken,
suche is the chaunce of warre, thus Lady Fortune daily turneth
her whiele, and mightie Mars, often varied his countenaunce, so that
one tyme the Englishemen gat by assaut and yeildyng, diuerse strong
tounes, Castles, and piles. At another season, the Frenche people, somtyme
by bargain, somtyme by assaut, obteined thesaid citees and fortificacions
again, or other in their sted. Whiche daily attemptes, Iomit

and ouer passe, because in thē, no notable acte, nor greate Warlike
feate was doen or committed. For small thynges, require litle writyng,
and t
                     •
                  we actes, require lesse speakyng. For I assure you, that he, which
should write the negligent losses, and the pollitique gaines, of euery
citee, fortresse, and turrett, whiche were gotten and loste in these daies,
should fatigate and wery the reader, more with volumes, then queares
and the hearer, more with triflyng woordes, then with notable matter.
Wherfore, sithe in all myne authors, I finde no matter, either greatly
necessarie, or muche conuenient to be spoken of, concernyng any high
enterprise: I therfore, leauyng bothe the nacions, daily studiyng how
to greue, and gain of the other, will turne again to other thynges accidentall
whiche chaunced in this .xii. yere.
               
                  ABOVT the moneth of Iune, Ihon duke of Burbon and Auerne,
taken prisoner at the battaill of Agyncourte, xviii. yeres paste, (as you
before haue heard) now paiyng his raunsome, whiche was .xviii.M.l.
sterlyng, and hauyng ready prepared all thynges necessary, for his triumphaunt
returne into his countrey, was taken with a moste sore and
greuous 
                     •
                  euer, whiche sh
                     •
                  rtely vnbodied his soule, in the citee of London,
on the daie appoynted, for his departure into Fraūce: whos
                     •
                   corps
was enterred, in the Grey Friers of thesaied citee. So by this, euery
creature maie se: that man purposeth &amp; God disposeth. I maie not forget
a chaunce whiche happened this yere, to thexample of princes, and
a spectacle of gouernors. For the deuill hymself, to set farther diuision
betwene the Englishe and Frenche nacion did apparell certain catchepoules,
and Parasites, cōmonly called titiuils and tale tellers, to sowe
discord and dissencion, betwene the dukes of Bedford and Burgoyne,
not fainyng trifles nor phātasies, but thynges of reproche, repugnaūt
to bothe their honors, estates, and dignities, with the whiche, eache of
them was as well pricked, as hastely spurred, so that all loue, betwene
theim ceased, all affinitie was forgotten, and all olde familiaritie was
cast by disdain, into the caue of obliuiō. Suche a pestilent breath hath
Flattery, and suche mischief ensueth, of Princes light credence. This
grudge was perceiued, by their mutuall frendes, whiche by charitable
exhortacion and Godly aduertisement, exhorted theim, to renewe their
old loue and familiaritie, and to mete and enteruieu, in some place decent
and conuenient. The Duke of Bedforde, gladly condiscended, to
come to sent Oners, beyng the duke of Burgoyns toune, and thither,
accordyng to his appoyntment, he in honorable estate, came and resorted,
and likewise did the duke of Burgoyne. The duke of Bedford, beyng
Regent of Fraunce, &amp; sonne, brother, and vncle to kynges, though
that the duke of Burgoyne, should first haue visited and saluted him:
duke Phillip on the other part, beyng Lord &amp; souereigne of the toune,
iudged it not mete, nor to stande with his honor, to go to hym, where he
was lodged, but was content, by entreatie of frendes, to mete with him
in a place indifferent, betwene bothe their harberowes: whiche offer

was not accepted, &amp; so, bothe parties departed discontent, &amp; neuer after
sawe or commoned with other. What should I speake of the corage of
these twoo proude princes, the Duke of Bedford myndyng to haue no
pere, and the duke of Burgoyne, willyng to haue no superior, by whose
proude disdain, and enuious discord, shortly Englande lost, and Burgoyne
gayned not long, as you shall perceiue, in this history ensuyng.
            
            
               ¶The .xiii. yere.The .xiii. yere.
               
               
                  THe Bastard of Orleaunce, called the erle of Duinoys,
the lorde Rocheford Marshal of Fraunce, with other
in the beginnyng of this .xiii. yere, tooke the toune of
saincte Denise by treason, and skirmished with theim
of Paris, and leauyng behynd hym a greate garrison,
tooke the toune of Howdone, and the bridge of saincte
Maxence by composicion, and at that time was taken
the toune, of Pount Meulane, by sodain scalyng of twoo fisshermen:
whiche entered vp at a common priuie, standyng on the walle. Thus
tounes vnwalled, wer preys to rauenous men of war, so that the poore
inhabitauntes within theim, (not beyng able to kepe their fidelitie or
allegeaunce, when sheilde and defence lacked,) were constrayned
and compelled, to yeilde and rendre theimselfes, to the more power,
and vpper hande: least thei beyng nedy and innocente people, should
be vexed and turmented, with the vnreasonable men of warre: So that
in all Christendome, no Region was more vnquiete, more vexed, more
poore, nor more to be pitied, then the coūtrey of Fraūce. And although
the rude and poore people, suffered many plagues and aduersities: yet
the souldiors, prospered not in all thynges. For although prey &amp; spoyle
sometyme refreshed their mindes, and did comfort their stomackes, yet
sometyme thei wer slain, taken, and licked vp, or thei were ware. For euery
prince studied, and circumspectly compassed, how to kepe, defende
and releue, the citees and tounes, of their seuerall faccion, and priuate
fidelitie. Wherfore, when sacietie of slaughters, and aboundaunce
of murthers, had replenished the stomackes, of bothe the nacions, and
that bothe in generall, perceiued their hurtes, pondered their losses,
and considered their ruynes, and daily affliccions: although their stomackes
wer haute, and their hartes stony, yet thei waxed softe, priuely
inclinyng to peace, and wisshyng concord, and not without an vrgente
cause: For all thynges necessary to mannes liuyng, penurie shewed her
self furth, and aboundaūce was hidden in a caue. The corne feldes laie
vntilled, the meddowes were ouer troden, the woodes were spoyled, so
that all men went to harneis, and no man to the plough. The churches
were seldome vsed for deuocion, but many tyemes spoyled, for desire of
gayne. These, and suche innumerable mischiefes, caused bothe the people,
beyng enemies, to desire peace, and yet the one part, disdained opē
                  ly
to offre it, or the other priuatly to receiue it.
               
                  THE crie and noyes of this perillous and insaciable warre, was

blasted through Europe, detested through Christendom, and especially,
at the Counsaill of Basill, where then themperor Alberte, and al the
princes and potestates of Christendome, or their deputies, were assembled,
for the vniō of the vngracious scisme, in the vsurped sea of Rome
vntruly, and against all scripture, called sainct Peters sea. Wherfore,
the Emperor and the temporall princeis, supposyng the exhortacion of
Spirituall fathers, should more profite emongest the twoo high stomacked,
and proude encoraged nacions, of Englande and of Fraunce,
desirered Eugeny then bishop of Rome, to be the author and arbitrer,
of that great strife and contencion: so that by his meanes, counsail and
exhortacion, the weapon might be taken out of the handes, of twoo so
inuincible nacions, which neuer would yeild or bowe, the one to the other,
neither yet, once heare of abstinence of fightyng, or refusyng from
warre: so muche were their hartes hardened, and so princely were their
stomackes. And one thyng, muche put them in hope, of some good conclusiō,
because the duke of Burgoyn was willyng, (so that it wer not of
his awne suite,) to returne and reconcile himself, to Charles, his mortal
enemie and auncient aduersary. Wherfore, by authoritie of this generall
Counsaill, two discreite persones, called the Cardinalles of sainct
Crosse, &amp; Cypres, came to the toune of Arras in Arthoys, whither, were
sente for the kyng of Englande, Henry Beaufford, Cardinall of Wynchester,
Henry, Archebishop of Yorke, Williā de la Pole Erle of Suffolke,
and Ihon Hollande Erle of Huntyngdon, with diuerse other
knightes and Esquiers: and for the Frenche kyng, were there present,
Charles Duke of Burbon, Lewes Erle of Uandosme, Arthur of Brytayne
Constable of Fraunce, the Archebishop of Reyns, and sir Phillip
Harcort. There, was the duke of Burgoyne, in proper persone, accompanied
with the duke of Gelders, and the Erles of Estampes, Lygnye,
sainct Paule, Uaudemont, Neuers, &amp; Daniel, sonne to the prince
of Orange, with a great gard and a gallaunt company.
               
                  VPON the daie of the first session, the Cardinal of sainct Crosse, declared
to the thre parties, the innumerable mischiefes, the multitude of
incōueniencies, whiche had succeded, through al Christendom, by their
daily discord and continuall discencion: exhortyng and requiryng thē,
for the honor of God, for the loue that thei bare to the settyng furthe of
Christes religion, and for the aduaūcement, of the publique wealth of
all Christendō, that thei would laye all rancor apart, represse all wrath
and anger, and conforme themselfes to reason, and to Godly concorde,
by the whiche, thei should receiue, honor, profite, and continuall quietnesse,
in the worlde, and of God, a reward euerlastyng. After whiche admonicion,
thus to them geuen, and after diuerse daies of communicacion,
euery part brought in their demaund, whiche wer moste contrary,
and harde to come to a good conclusion. The Englishemen required,
that kyng Charles should haue nothyng, but at the hande of the kyng
of Englande, and that not as duetie, but as a benefite, by hym of his

mere liberalitie geuen, and distributed, to whiche the Frenchmen aunswered,
that kyng Charles would haue the kyngdom, frākely &amp; frely,
without begging it, of another man: requiryng the kyng of England,
to leaue the name, Armes, and title of the Kyng of Fraunce, and to be
content with the dukedoms of Aquitain and Normādy, and to forsake
Paris, and all the tounes, whiche thei possessed in Fraunce, betwene
the Riuers of Loyre and Soame, beyng no percell of the Du
                     •
                  hie of
Normandy. The Englishemen, loth to lease so good a boty as Paris,
did not esteme and allowe, the demaundes of the French Ambassadors
and thei on the otherside, couetyng and desiryng, to obtein again the
renoume and glory of their Region, whiche was Paris, would in no
wise condiscend, to any part of the Englishe requestes. Thus, the pride
of the one part, and the ambicion of the other, letted concord, peace, and
quietnes. The Cardinals, seyng the frostie hartes, and hardened myndes
of bothe parties, determined not, to despute the titles, but offered
to them, honest and reasonable condicions, of truce and peace, for a season:
whiche articles bothe parties, either for frowardnes, or for disdain
openly refused: In so muche as, the Englishmen in greate displeasure,
departed to Calice, and so into Englande. One writer affirmeth, that
thei beyng warned of a secrete conspiracie moued against theim, sodainly
remoued from Arras, and so sailed into their countrey.
               
                  VVHILES this treatie of peace, was thus in cōmunicacion at Arras,
the Lorde Talbot, the Lorde Willoughby, the lorde Scales, with
the Lorde Lisle Adame, and fiue thousande men, besieged the toune of
S. Denise, with a strong bande. The Erle of Dumoys hearyng therof,
accompanied with the Lorde Lohac, and the lorde Bueill, &amp; a great
company of horsemen, haisted thitherward, to rayse the siege, and in the
meane waie, thei encountered with sir Thomas Ki
                     •
                  iell, and Matthew
Gouthe, ridyng also toward. S. Denise, betwene whom, was a great
conflict, and many slain on bothe parties: but sodainly came to the aide
of the Frenchmen, the garrison of Poūt Melance, whiche caused thenglishemen
to returne, without any great arme or damage, sauyng that
Matthew Gouth, by founderyng of his horsse, was taken and caried
to Pount Melance. Duryng whiche fight, the toune of sainct Denise,
was rendered to the lorde Talbot, and the other lordes, whiche caused
al the walles to be raised, and abated doune to the ground, sauyng the
walles of the Abbay, and a Toure called Uenyn. After this toune gotten,
the Lorde Willoughby, left sir Ihon Ruppelley at Pounthoyse, &amp;
departed to gouerne Paris, whiche then began to smoke, and sone after,
brast out in flame, (as you shall shortly, apparaūtly perceiue). After
whose departure, thenhabitaines of Pounthoyse rebelled, &amp; droue out
thenglishmen by very force, and rendered themselfes subiectes to king
Charles. This toune was small, but the losse was great, for it was the
very conuenient kaye, betwene Paris and Normandy, so that now the
gate betwene them bothe, was set open and the passage at large.
               
                  
                  LET vs now again, returne to the counsail at Arras. After the Englishe
Ambassadors wer departed, the Frenchemen and the Burgonyons,
began familiarly to common of a peace, and talke of an amitie, to
the whiche mocion, Phillip duke of Burgoyne, was neither deiffe nor
straunge: for he in the beginnyng of his rule, beyng muche desirous to
reuenge and punishe the shamefull murder doen to his father, and to
kepe hymself in his high estate, and preeminence, began to be associate,
and to reigne with thenglishe power, and to serue the kyng of Englād
thinking, that by his amity and ioynyng, that he should neither harme
nor hurte, the common wealth of the countrey, whereof at that tyme he
bare the whole rule, nor yet lose one iote or poynt, of his authoritie, or
gouernaunce. But when it happened, contrary to his expectacion, that
the kyng of Englande, by the right course of inheritaunce, tooke vpon
hym the whole rule and gouernaunce, within the realme of Fraunce,
and ordered by the aduise of his coūsaill, al causes, iudgementes, warres,
and cōcordes, &amp; that the duke iudged, that he was not had in great
confidence, nor in perfite truste, as he thought, because the Duke of
Bedforde, would not suffre the toune of Orleaunce, to be rendered to
hym, (as you before haue heard): He therfore imagined, &amp; determined
with hymself, to returne into the pathe again, from the whiche he had
straied and erred, and to take part, and ioyne with his awne bloud and
nacion: so that some honest meane, might be sought by other, and not
by hymself, least paraduenture by his awne sekyng, he might bind him
self in condicions hurtfull, &amp; sore inconueniences, to the Frenche kyng,
and also be noted of vntruth, and traiterous behauor, toward the king
of Englande and his nacion: to whom he had doen homage, leage, and
sworne fealtie. Now this Counsaill, was to hym a cloke for the rayne,
as who should say, that he sought not amitie, of the Frēche kyng, (whiche
thyng in his harte, he moste coueted and desired) but was therunto
persuaded, by the generall counsaill, and by the bishop of Rome, whom
it was reason, in all honest requestes, that he should submitte hymself,
and humbly obey. And so, shadowed with this counsaill, without long
argument or prolongyng of tyme, he tooke a determinate peace, and a
finall conclusion, vpon these condiciōs: that he should haue to hym deliuered,
the counteis of Arthoys, Ponthiew, and Bullonoys, and the
tounes of Amience, Corby, Mondidier, Peron, sainct Quintyne, &amp; Abbeuile,
with many other seigniories, &amp; superiorities, whiche be not for
my purpose to reherse. Prouided alwaie, that the French kyng, paiyng
in redy money, to y• duke or his heires, iiij.C.M. crounes, should haue
thesaied tounes and countres, to be redeliuered again: and many other
thynges, the Frenche kyng graunted, to the duke of Burgoyn, whiche
after, he was not able to performe, nor accomplishe, for he had no power,
to make deniall to the duke, of any demaund or request, whiche the
Duke either phantasied or moued: as who would saie, that he thought
in himself, that suche an aduersary, whiche desired so honest, and so reasonable

condicions, (consideryng the state of the tyme, and the occasion
of concorde, moste apparauntly offered to hym,) ought neither to be refused
nor cast awaie, the whiche chaunce, was to hym luckey and fortunate:
for surely, y• thyng foresene and loked for, succeded and toke place,
as you shall perceiue. This concorde, was so pleasaunt to the Frenche
kyng, that he, not only set for hym: but as a swane that swimmeth after
her make, met hym in proper persone, at the citee of Reynes, and (after
long cōmunicaciō) standing vp vpō his fete, said to him these wordes.

                     e of Burgoyne. with all my harte welcome,
and at your comming, my harte is fulfilled with ioy, and my spirites
be refreshed with solace, for now, all doubte of the recouery, of my
lande and seigniory, is clerely banished, and fully abandoned: consideryng
that I haue now, ioyned and vnited to me, the principall yere, the
moste noble prince, (nexte to the Croune) and the moste valeaunt capitain,
that hath been, or is, in our daies, sene, or knowen, whom the nobilitie
honor, the chiualrie fauor, and the poore commons loue, and daily
desire to beholde: So that all men loue, and embrace you, aboue all
creatures, and worship and reuerence you, aboue all Lordes, because
you, beyng a straiyng shepe, are now returned, to your olde flocke, and
like a man wanderyng out of the pathe, are now brought again, to the
right waie, and true limite. For surely, this text was euer beaten much
in my hedde: that euery realme, deuided emongest theimselfe, should
turne to desolaciō, and that all discord, should bryng pouertie, and that
of al discencion, should succeade misery: which intollerable calamities,
I euer iudged to ensue, by the discorde and contrauersie, betwene vs
twoo. But now the sore is cured, and the ship brought into the sure hauen:
trustyng perfectly, and nothyng mistrustyng, but by your healp
and aide, we shall expell, cleane pull vp by the rootes, and put out, all
the Englishe nacion, out of our realmes, territories, and dominions.
And if you helpe vs, (as you maie) and if you aide vs, (as you be able)
we here promise you, in the worde of a prince, to be yours, yea, so yours,
that al ours, shalbe yours, at your commaundement and desire, not as
ours, but as yours, to doo and spende at your pleasure. To the whiche,
the duke of Burgoyn aunswered, that he would let scape nothing, that
appertayned to his duetie, nor forget any poynt, whiche might turne
to his dishonor.
               
                  VVHEN this league was sworne, and this knot was knit, the duke
of Burgoyne, to lette a vayle, before the kyng of Englandes iyes, sent
Thoison Dor, his kyng at Armes, to kyng Henry with letters: that
he, beyng not only waxed faint, and wetled, with continual warre, and
daily conflictes, but also chafed daily, with complaintes and lamentacion,
of his people, whiche, of the Frenchemen, suffered losse and detriment,
embraydyng and rebukyng hym openly, affirmyng, that he onely
was the supporter and mainteyner, of the Englishe people, and that
by his meanes and power, the mortall warre was continued and sette

forward, and that he more diligētly studied, and intentiuely toke pain,
bothe to kepe, and maintein thenglishmen in Fraunce, and also to aduaūce
and promote their desires, &amp; intentes, rather then to restore kyng
Charles his cosyn, to his rightful inheritaunce, &amp; paternal possession:
by reason of which thynges, and many other, he was in maner compelled
and const
                     •
                  ained, to take a peace, and conclude an amitie with Kyng
Charles, exhortyng kyng Henry, with many flatteryng wordes, when
honest and reasonable condicions wer offered, to take thē, and to make
an ende of the war, whiche so long had continued, to the decay of bothe
the realmes, and to the effusion of Christen bloud, beside the great displeasure
of almightie God, whiche is the author of peace and vnitie:
promisyng hym his aide, and furtheraunce in that behalfe, with many
glosyng and flatteryng wordes, whiche I passe ouer.
               
                  HERE is to be noted, that the Duke of Burgoyne, whiche thought
hymself by this concord, in maner dishonored, and spotted with infamy
sente his letters to the Kyng of Englande, rather to purge and excuse
hymselfe, of his vntruth and infidelitie, (yea of periury, if a poore man
maie vse that terme, of so greate a prince) to thentent that it should appere,
that he, by cōpulsion, and not by voluntarie affeccion, was turned
to the French part: not for any malice or displeasure, whiche he bare to
kyng Henry, or to the Englishe nacion. This letter was not alitle loked
on, nor 
                     ••
                  ally regarded of the kyng of England, and his sage coū
                  saill:
not onely for the waightines of the matter, but also for the sodain
chaunge of the man, &amp; for the straūge superscripcion of the letter, which
was: To the high and mightie Prince, Henry, by the grace of GOD Kyng of
Englande, his vvelbeloued cosyn: Neither namyng hym kyng of Fraunce,
nor his souereigne lorde, accordyng as, (euer before that tyme) he was
accustomed to do. Wherfore al thei, whiche wer present, beyng sore moued
with the craftie deede, &amp; vntrue demeanor of the duke, (whom thei
so muche trusted) could neither temper their passions, nor moderate
their yre, nor yet bridle their toungues; but openly called hym traytor,
deceiuer, and moste inconstant prince. But when the rumor of the Dukes
returnyng, was published emongest the common people, thei lefte
woordes and went to stripes: for thei beyng moued and pricked, with
this vnhappie tidynges, ran fiersly vpon all the Flemynges, Hollanders,
and Burgonyons, whiche then inhabited within the citee of London,
and the suburbes of thesame, and slewe and hurte, agreate nombre
of them, before thei, by the kynges proclamacion, could be prohibited,
to leaue of and abstain, from suche violence, and iniurious doyng:
for the kyng nothyng more mynded, then to saue innocent bloud, and
defende them, whiche had not offended.
               
                  AFTER the letter twise redde, and wisely brooked, he willed the officer
at Armes, to tell his master, that it was not conuenient, nor honorable
for hym, to be enemie to the Englishe nacion, without cause or
occasion geuen, but his duetie, (all thynges consydered) was to haue

kept his auncient truthe and oulde allegeaūce, rather then to be the occasion,
of newe warre and freashe discencion: aduertisyng hym farther,
that it was not the poynt of a wisemā, to leaue and let passe, the certain
for the vncertain, admonishyng hym also, not to myngle and mixte his
safetie and surenesse, with the vnstablenesse and vnsuretie of his newe
alye, and cosyn, kyng Charles. When the messenger was departed, the
kyng of England and his counsaill, thought and determined, to worke
some displeasure to the duke, and to set some conspiracie, against hym
in his awne coūtrey. Wherfore by rewardes, thei did su
                     •
                  or
                     •

certain gouernors and rulers, of tounes and cities, within the dukes
countreis and dominiōs, (which nacions surely, be euer proc
                     ••
                  ue &amp;
ready, to commocion and rebellion.) But the Gantoys, whiche of that
feate euer bare the bell, and wer the common rysers, against their souereigne
lordes, some of them imagenyng, that the power of the Englishmen,
was not long like to continue, within the realme of Fraūce, more
for feare, then loue of their Duke, sat still and moued not, but let other
tounes alone, whiche sore troubled the Dukes wittes, and a greate
while, did disquiet and vexe his senses.
               
                  THIS yere the .xiiij. daie of September, died Ihon Duke of Bedford,
Regent of Fraunce, a man, as pollitique in peace, as hardy in war
and yet no more hardy in warre, then mercifull, when he had victory,
whose bodye was, with greate funerall solempnitie, buried in the
Cathedrall churche of our Lady, in Roan, on the Northside of the high
aulter, vnder a sumptuous and costly monument: whiche tombe and
sepulture, when kyng Lewes the .xj. sonne to this kyng Charles, which
recouered again Normandy, did well aduise and behoulde, certayne
noble men in his company, hauyng more youthe then discrecion, and
more enuie in their hartes, then consideracions of their parentes, counsailed
hym to deface and plucke doune the tombe, and to cast the deede
carcasse into the feldes: affirmyng, that it was a greate dishonor, bothe
to the kyng and to the realme, to se the enemie of his father, and theirs,
to haue so solempne &amp; riche memorial. Kyng Lewes aunswered again,
saiyng: what honor shall it be to vs, or to you, to breake this monumēt,
and to pull out of the ground and take vp, the deed bones of hym, whō
in his life, neither my father, nor your progenitors, with all their power,
puyssaūce, and frēdes, wer once able, to make flie one foote backeward,
but by his strength, witte, and pollicie, kepte theim all out of the
principall dominions, of the realme of Fraunce, and out of this noble
and famous duchie of Normandy: wherfore I saie, first, God haue his
soule, &amp; let his body now lye in reste, whiche, when he was a liue, would
haue disquieted▪ the proudest of vs all: and as for the tombe, I assure
you, is not so decent, nor conuenient for hym, as his honor and Actes
deserued, although it wer muche richer, and more beautifull.

                  AFter the death of this noble prince, and valeaunt capitain,
the bright sunne, that commonly shone in Fraūce
faire and beautifully vpon the Englishmen, began to
be c
                     •
                  oudie, and daily to waxe darker: for the Frēchmen
seyng the chief capitain taken awaie, began not onely
to refuse their obedience, and loyaltie, whiche thei had
sworne, and promised to the kyng of Englande, but takyng
swearde in hande, rebelled, persecuted, and openly defied the Englishmen,
yet all these mischaunces, not one poynt abated, the valeaūt
corages of the Englishe people: for thei nothyng mistrustyng God, nor
good Fortune, set vp a newe saile, and began the warre new again, and
appoynted for regent in Fraunce, Richard duke of Yorke, sonne to Richard
erle of Cambridge. Although the duke of Yorke, bothe for birthe
and corage, was worthy of this honor and preferment, yet he was so
disdained of Edmond duke of Somerset, beyng cosin to the kyng, that
he was promoted to so high an office, (whiche he in verie deede, gaped
and loked for) that by al waies and meanes possible, he bothe hindered
and detracted hym, glad of his losse, and sory of his well dooryng, causyng
hym to linger in Englande, without dispatche, till Paris and the
floure of Fraunce, were gotten by the Frenche Kyng. The Duke of
Yorke, perceiuyng his euill will, openly dissimuled that, whiche he
inwardly thought priuely, eche workyng thynges, to the others displesure.
This cancard malice, and pestiferous diuision, so long continued,
in the hartes of these twoo princes, till mortall warre consumed theim
bothe, and almoste all their lynes and ofsprynges, as within few yeres
you shall perceiue and se.
               
                  THE Normans of the countrey of Caux, beyng somewhat hartened,
by the death of the duke of Bedforde, began a newe rebellion, and
slewe diuerse Englishmen, and robbed many praty tounes, whiche wer
of kyng Hēries faccion &amp; part, &amp; toke the toune of Harflew by assaute,
and diuerse other tounes. The lorde Talbot beyng aduertised, of this
rebellion, sent for the Lorde Scales, sir Thomas Kiriell, and the lorde
Hoo, whiche afflicted and plagued the people of Caux, that thei slew aboue
fiue thousand persones, and brent all the tounes, and villages in
the countrey, not beyng walled, so that in that parte, was neither habitacion
nor tillage, for all the people fled into Britayne, and all the beastes
of the countrey, wer brought to Cawdebe
                     •
                  , wher a good shepe was
sould for an Englishe peny, and a kowe for xii. pence. Daily was skirmishyng
&amp; fightyng in euery part, in so muche that the Lorde Scales
with foure hundred Englishemen, discomfited at the Rye beside Roan,
the Heire and fiftene hundred valeaunt Frenchemen, and sir Richarde
Reignold de Fountaynes, sir Aleyne Gerond, Alayne de Monsay, and
Geffrey Grame capitain of the Scottes, and thre hundred, and mo wer
taken prisoners, beside seuen faire and pleasaūt coursers. But this victorie
staied not the hartes of the Frenche nacion, for their myndes were

so full of treason, and their malice so greate against the Englishemen,
that many tounes turned, to the parte of kyng Charles, without conquest
or desire, and diuerse were sould for couetousnes, and many were
deliuered by treason, as Depe, Boys de Uyncennes, and other.
               
                  HERE is one especiall poynte to be noted, that either the disdayne
emongest the chief peres of the realme of Englande, (as you
haue hearde,) or the negligence of the kynges counsaill, (whiche did
not with quicke sight, forese and preuent thynges for to come) was the
losse of the whole dominion of Fraunce, betwene the riuers of Soame
and Marne, and in especiall of the noble citee of Paris. For where before
tymes there were sent ouer, for the aide and tuicion of the tounes,
and citees, brought vnder the obeysaunce, of the English nacion, thousandes
of men, apte and mete for the warre, and defence: now were sent
into Fraunce, hundredes, yea scores, some rascall, and some not able to
drawe a bowe, or cary a bill. For the lorde Willoughby, and the bishop
of Tyrwyne, whiche had the gouernaunce, of the greate and large citie
of Paris, had in their company, not two thousande Englishmen. Whiche
weakenes kyng Charles well perceiued. Wherefore he appoynted
Arthur of Britayne, the Erle of Dumoys Bastarde of Orleaunce, the
Lordes de la Roche, and Lisle Adame, and other valeaunt capitaines,
aswell Burgonyons as Frenche, to go before Paris, trustyng by the
fauor of certain citezens, with whom he had greate intelligence, and
knewe thenglishemennes power and doynges, shortly to be lorde of the
citee and toune, without any greate losse or battaill. So these capitaynes
came before the citee of Paris, but perceiuyng, that all thynges
succeded not, accordyng to their expectaciō, returned to Mount Marter,
and the next daie, sodainly set on the toune of sainct Denise, where,
the Englishemen manfully defended theim selfes, but beyng oppressed
with so greate a multitude, thei wer compelled to flie into the Abbaye,
and into the Toure of Uenyn, for succor and refuge: in whiche conflicte
twoo hundred Englishemen wer slain, and the rest, vpon a reasonable
composicion, rendered the toune, and departed to Paris.
               
                  THOMAS Lorde Beaumond, whiche of late was come to Paris
with eight hundred men, issued out of Paris, with sixe hundred souldiors,
onely intendyng to se, and vieue the doynges and nombre of the
Frenche armye, but he was sodainly espied, and compassed aboute: so,
that within a small space, he was discomfited and taken, and with hym
foure score prisoners, beside twoo hundred whiche wer slain on the feld,
and the remnaunt chased to the very gates of the citee. The Parisians
and in especiall the Master of the Halles, and some of the Uniuersitie,
and Michael Laillier, and many notable burgesses of the toune, (whiche,
euer with an Englishe countenaunce, couered a Frenche harte) perceiuyng
the weakenes of the Englishemen, and the force and strengthe
of the Frenchemen, signifiyng to the Frenche capitaines, their mindes
and intentes, willed them to come with all diligence, to receiue so riche

a prey to them, without any difficultie, offred and geuen. The Constable
delaiyng no tyme, cam with his power, and lodged by the Charterhous:
and the lorde Lisle Adame, approchyng the walles, shewed to the
citezens, a charter, sealed with the greate seale of kyng Charles, by the
whiche he had pardoned them their offences, and graunted to them all
the old liberties and auncient priuileges, so thei would hereafter be to
hym, obedient, true, and seruiceable. Whiche thyng to theim declared,
thei ranne aboute the toune, criyng: sainct Denise, liue kyng Charles.
The Englishemen perceiuyng this, determined to kepe the gate of. S
Denise, but thei were deceiued, for the cheynes were drawen in euery
streate, and women and children cast doune stones, and scaldyng water
on the Englishemennes heddes, and the citezens persecuted them, from
streate to streate, and from lane to lane, and slewe and hurt, diuerse and
many of theim. The bishop of Tyrwyne, Chauncellor there for kyng
Henry, and the lord Willoughby, and sir Simon Moruier, toke great
pain, to appeace the people, and represse their furie: but when thei saw,
that all auailed not, thei withdrue theimselfes, to the Bastell of sainct
Anthony, whiche fortresse, thei had well vitailed and furnished, with
men and municions.
               
                  VVHILES this rumor was in the toune, therle of Dumoys &amp; other
scaled the walles, and some passed the Riuer by boates, and opened the
gate of sainct Iames, at the whiche the Constable with his banner displaied
entered, at whose entrie, the Parisians wer very glad, and made
greate ioye. The bishop and the Lorde Willoughby, with their small
cōpany, defended their fortresse, tenne daies, lokyng for aide, but when
thei sawe that no comforte appered, thei yeilded their fortresse, so that
thei &amp; theirs, with certain baggage, might peaceably returne to Roan,
whiche desire was to them graunted. Then as thei departed, the Parisians
rayled, mocked, and taunted the Englishmen, with the moste spitefull
wordes, and shameful termes, that could be inuented or deuised:
so that all men maie apparauntly perceiue, that their hartes neuer
thought, as their toungues vttered. For notwithstandyng their obeysaunce
and fidelitie, sworne to Kyng Henry, and nothyng regardyng
the finall composicion, to the whiche thei had sette their common seale,
when thei sawe thenglishmen at the weakest, thei turned the leafe and
sang another song: declaryng to all men their inconstaunt hartes, their
waueryng mindes, and vntrue demeanor. Thus was the cite of Paris
brought again into the possession of the French kyng, which, ther altered
officers, and ordained lawes, at his pleasure, for the surety &amp; safegarde
of hym, his realme, and people.
               
                  AFTER this glorious gain, the Frenche kyng besieged the toune
of Crayle, vpon Oyse, wherof sir William Chāberlayn, was capitain,
whiche, with fiue hundred Englishmen, issued out of the toune, and after
long fight, discomfited his enemies, and slewe twoo hundred, and
toke a greate nombre prisoners: the remnaunt not likyng their market,

departed to Champeigne, and other tounes adioynyng. Duryng
whiche season, xii. Burgesses of the toune of Gysors, solde it for money
to Poyton of Xantrayles, but he had not the Castle deliuered. Wherfore
with all his power, he besieged thesame, wherof the Lorde Talbot
beyng aduertised, sent for the lorde Scales, and thei bothe with .xviii.
hundred men, rescued the Castle, toke the toune, and discomfited their
enemies, and slewe of theim aboue foure hundred persones. Now was
the old prouerbes verefied, that he that commeth a daie after the faire,
commeth to late, and when the s
                     •
                  ede is stollen, it is no bote to shutte the
stable dore. For when Paris, sainct Denise, sainct Germayns in Lay,
and many other tounes in Fraunce, were taken and betrayed, for lacke
of succors and sufficient garrisons, then the duke of Yorke appoynted
at the parliament before, to be Regent of Fraunce, and by the disdaine
and enuie of the duke of Somerset, and other, not till now dispatched,
was sente into Normandy, with eight thousande men, and in his company,
the Erles of Salisbury, and Suffolke, and the Lorde Fawconbridge,
and diuerse valeaunt capitaines. When he was landed at Har
                  
                     •
                  lewe,
the Erle of Salisbury, besieged the Castle of Chamboys, whiche
shortly was to hym rendered. Then the Duke remoued to Roan, where
he set good orders, and did greate Iustice in the countrey, wherfore the
Normans in their Chronicle, highly extoll and muche magnifie hym,
for that poynte: howbeit, thei saie, that he gat by long siege, the toune
and Abbay of Fecāpe, and did none other notable act, duryng the tyme
of his rule and gouernaunce.
               
                  PHILLIP Duke of Burgoyne whiche, (as you haue heard) brake
bothe his othe and promise with the kyng of England, imagened with
hymself, that the Englishemen were like shortely, to be expulsed out
of al the tounes on that side the sea, and that thei had no certain refuge
nor place to resorte to, out of ieoperdy, but onely the toune of Calice.
Wherfore, he assembled his counsaill, and the heddes of the citees and
tounes of Flaunders, Brabant, Hollande, and Zelande, in the toune of
Gaunt, wher was declared to them, the right, title, and interest, that he
had to the toune of Calice, and the Countie of Guysnes, as a very patrimony,
belongyng to his inheritaunce: she wyng farther, that thesaid
toune was the golffe, and swallower vp, of all the golde &amp; siluer of his
countreis and dominions, for asmuche as ther, was the staple of woolles,
tynne, leade, and other marchaundise, for the whiche, the Englishemen
would take no common currant money, but onely gold and siluer,
to the greate impouerishment of his seigniories, and Regions: saiyng
farther, that Calice onely was the common stop, betwene his countreis
and Britayne, and Spayne, so that Southward, nor Westwarde, his
subiectes could not passe, without the daungier of that toune. Wherefore
these detrimentes considered, he determined, (if thei would assent)
shortly to recouer and conquer, that toune and the countie of Guisnes.
To this purpose all the counsaill, and cōmon people, not onely agreed,

but also promised aide, bothe of men and money. Lorde how the Flemines
bragged, and the Hollanders craked, that Calice should be wonne
and all the Englishemen slain, swearyng, and staryng, that thei would
haue it, within thre daies at the moste: thynkyng verely, that the toune
of Calice, could no more resist their puyssaunce, then a potte of double
beere, when thei fall to quaffyng.
               
                  TO tel you what ordenaūce was new cast, what pouder was bought
what engynes were deuised, what harneis was prouided, what vitale
was purueyed for this greate enterprise: I will not comber you, in rehersyng
euery thyng perticularly, because the Flemynges write, that
the prouision was more then toung could speake, or harte could thinke
yet you maie beleue as you list. These doynges were not so priuie, but
sir Ihon Radcliffe deputie of the toune of Calice, was therof enformed
and shortly of thesame, aduertised kyng Henry, and his counsaill, whiche
incontinent sent thither, the Erle of Mortayne sonne to the Duke
of Somersette, and the Lorde Cammeys with .xv.C. men, and greate
foyson of vitaille, whiche tissued out of Calice, and came before Grauelyne,
where thei wer encountered, with a greate nombre of Flemynges,
whiche were shortly discomfited, and foure hundred of theim slain, and
sixe score taken prisoners, and caried to Calice. And within twoo daies
after, the Englishmen draue by fine force, the lordes of Waurayn and
Bado, to the barriers of Arde, &amp; discomfited the company, to the nōber
of .xv.C. and slewe vij. valeaunt capitaines, and toke many gentlemen
prisoners. Phillip duke of Burgoyne, abidyng still in his high &amp; warlike
enterprise, assēbled together of Flemynges, Pycardes, Hollāders,
and Henowiers a great army, to the nombre of .xl.M. so well armed, so
wel vitailed, so wel furnished with ordenaunce, &amp; so wel garnished in al
thynges, that thei thought in their hartes, and blasted emongest theim
selfes, that the Calicians, would leaue the toune desolate, &amp; flie for their
sauegard, hearyng onely the approchyng of the Gauntoys. But thei
reckened before their host, and so paied more then their shotte came to.
When this gallant army, was passed the water at Grauelyn, the duke
intendyng to begin his greate conquest, besieged and assauted the litle
and poore Castle of Oye, whiche hauyng in it but .L. souldiors, of the
whiche .xii. sold their liues derely, the remnaunt compelled by necessity
yeilded themselfes symplie to the duke, which to please the Gauntoys,
beyng of the moste puissaunt cōpany in his army, liberally gaue to thē
bothe the Castle and the prisoners, as a signe and token of good lucke,
and fortunate victory. Whiche rude &amp; beastly persons, nothyng expert
in warre, or lawes of Armes, not only rased and abated the Castle, but
also hanged .xxix. of the captiues, &amp; had so doen with all the remnaunt
if the duke (disdainyng their crueltie) had not intreated for the rest.
               
                  AFTER this victory, litle honorable and lesse profitable, the Pycardes
besieged the Castle of Marke, and three tymes assauted it, more
to their losse, then gayne. The Englishemen within, whereof sir Ihon

Geddyng was capitain, set out the banner of sainct George, and rang
the belles, to the intent to haue succors from the toune of Calice. But
the capitaines there, myndyng not to lese the more for the lesse, nor the
substaunce for the accident, wisshed them good lucke, and good fortune
without any aide sēdyng. For doubt of the dukes great army &amp; power,
The souldiors within Marke, beyng but twoo hundred and sixe, seyng
no hope of succor, and desperate of comfort, rendered theimselfes to the
duke vpon condicion: that their lifes and lymmes should be saued, and
so thei wer conueyed in suer custody, to the toune of Gaunt, and the castle
of Marke was rased and defaced.
               
                  AFTER this act dooen, the duke of Burgoyne, accompanied with
the Duke of Cleues, the Erle of Estampes, the Lordes of Dantoyng,
Croy, Cresquy, Humyers, and many other valeaunt Barons, &amp; knightes,
with his greate army, came before the toune of Calice, and placed
his siege about thesame, moste to his aduauntage, and to the most displeasure
of his enemies. He gaue thre great assautes to the toune, but
his people wer not so fierce to assaut, but thenglishemen wer as quicke
to defend: so that he, gainyng so litle at these iii. enterprises, was contēt
to abstain frō farther approching toward the walles. At the first assaut
the Heire, whiche was come to se the duke of Burgoyn, was sore wounded
and hurte. Beside this, the duke had daily one great iye sore, which
was by cause that at euery tyde, shippes arriued in the hauen, out of
England, openly before his face, laden with vitail, municiōs, and men
and also the Calicians would for the nonce, putte out cattaill into the
marish, vnder the toune walles, the thentent to prouoke the Flemynges
to come within their catchyng, and daungier, whiche beyng couetous
of prey, and gayne, often aduentured, and seldome returned again: for
many by this meanes wer taken prisoners, but many mo slain with ordenaunce.
The duke one day rode about, to vieue and behold the situacion,
and the walles of the toune, to thentent to take his moste aduaū
                  tage,
either by assaute or shot of ordenaunce. He was quickely espied,
and with the stroke of a Canon, a trōpeter whiche rode next before him
and thre horses in his company, wer slain out of hande. When he sawe
that all thynges succeded not to his purpose, he firste set the Lorde of
Croy, and a conuenient nombre, to besiege the castle of Guysnes, wher
thesaied capitain gat litle profite, and did lesse harme: And after deuised
how to stoppe the hauen, so that no succors should entre there, and
also, to prohibite thē within the toune, to make any egresse or rode outward,
and so by this meanes, to famishe and compell them to yeild, and
rendre the toune. This deuise was set forward, and nothyng slepte: for
iiii. great hulkes wer laden, with great square stones, semented &amp; ioyned
together with lead, to thentent that thei should lye still, like a moūt
and not to seuer a sunder. These shippes with the rēnaunt of the dukes
nauie, wer cōueyed into the mouth of Calice hauen, and in a full sea by
craft and pollicie, were sounke doune to the ground; but whether God

would not that the hauen should be destroyed, either the conueyers of
the huikes, knewe not the very channell, these foure greate shippes at
the lowe water, laie openly vpon the sandes, without any hurte doyng
to the rode or chānel, which whē the souldiors had perceiued, thei issued
out of the toune, and brake the shippes, and caried both the stones and
the tymbre into the toune, whiche serued them well, to their fortificacions.
The seconde deuise was also accomplished, whiche was a strong
bastell, set on a litle mountayne, furnished with .iiii.C. men and muche
artilarie, whiche fortresse, did let thenglishemen to issue out, when thei
would, to their greate displeasure and disturbaunce.
               
                  VVHILES these thynges wer in doyng, there ariued into the dukes
army, an herault of England called Pembroke, belongyng to the duke
of Gloucester, whiche declared to the duke of Burgoyne, that the Protector
of England his master, (if God would send hym wynde and wether)
would geue battail to hym and his whole puyssaūce, either there,
or in any other place, within his awne countrey, where he would appoynt:
but the daie he could not assigne, because of the inconstancie of
the wind, and mutabilitie of the aire. The duke (like a noble man) aunswered
the herault: sir saie to your master, that his request is bothe honorable
and reasonable, howbeit, he shall not nede to take pain, to seke
me in myne awne countrey, for (GOD willyng) he shal finde me here,
till I haue my will of the toune, ready to abide hym, and all the power
that he can make. After this aunswere made, the Heraulte was highly
feasted, and had a cup and a hundred golden gyldens, to hym deliuered
for a reward, and so returned to Calice. After whose departure, the
duke called a greate counsaill, in the chief pauilion of the Gauntoys,
and there declared bothe the heraultes message and his aunswere, desiryng
them to regard his honor, the estimacion of their countreis, and
the honesties of themselfes, and like men to receiue their enemies, and
valeauntly to defende their aduersaries, promisyng to theim victory,
gain, and perpetual glory. Lorde how the Flemynges threatened, how
the Pycardes craked, and how the Hollanders sware, that thenglishmē
should be killed and slain, promisyng to the duke, rather to dye then to
flie, or to be recreaunt. Whiles this great matter was in consultacion,
the Calicians, not well contented with the bastell, whiche the duke had
newly builded, issued out of the toune, in a great nombre, part on foote,
and part on horsebacke. The footemen ran to assaut the bastile, and the
horssemen, went betwene the army and the assailaūtes, to stop the ayde
and succors whiche might come. The alarmy was sounded, in somuch
that the Duke in proper persone, was commyng on foote to releue his
people, but by the meanes of the horsmen, he was staied and kept backe
a space, in the whiche delaye of tyme, the Englishmen by fine force gat
the place, and slewe .Clx. persones, the remnaunt wer taken prisoners,
and defaced the fortresse, and set it on fire: cariyng with them, al the ordinaūce
and artilerie, into the toune of Calice, to the great displeasure,

of the Duke and his counsaill. The nexte daie after, there sprang a rumor
in the army (no man could tell how) that the Duke of Gloucester
with a greate puyssaunce, was all ready embarked and shipped, and
would arriue at the next tyde, and come doune before Calice, and raise
the siege. What was the very cause, I cannot truly write: but surely,
thesame night the Duke fled awaie, and sent in all hast to the Lorde of
Croye, to reise his siege before Guysnes, whiche tidynges were to hym
very ioyous, for he neither got nor saued: so these twoo capitaines departed,
leauyng behynde, bothe ordinaunce, vitaill, and greate riches.
The Frenche writers, to saue the honor of the Duke of Burgoyne, saie,
that there was a certain discord and commocion, emongest the Fleminges
and duche nacion: affirmyng, that the great lordes and the Pycardes,
(whom the Frenchemen greatly extoll) would betraye and sell the
Fleminges, and their frendes, &amp; that, for thesame cause, in a greate fury
thei cried, home, home, &amp; would not tary, for no request the Duke could
make, nor no exhortaciō that could be giuen: and so by their misgouernaunce,
the Duke was enforced to raise his siege and to departe. The
Flemishe authors affirme the contrary, saiyng: that thei were ready to
abide the cōmyng of the duke of Gloucester, but the duke of Burgoyn
fearyng to be trapped, betwene the duke of Gloucesters army before,
and the garrison of Calice behynde, so that he could escape by no waie,
fled awaie in the night, geuyng to theim no warnyng before. So that
for lacke of tyme, and cōuenient space, to lade and cary their stuffe, and
beyng com
                     •
                  aunded to retire with all spede and diligence, thei were
compelled to lose, and leaue behynde theim, their vitaill, and tentes, to
their great losse and detriment. Now it is at your liberties, (gentle reders)
whether you will geue credite to the Frenchmen, (whiche wer absent,
and no d
                     •
                  ers in the acte) or to the Flemynges, (which were partakers
of the losse and dishonor.) But the infallible veritie is, that he fled
the .xxvj. daie of Iuly in the night, and the next daie in the mornyng,
the duke of Gloucester, landed in Calice hauen, and straight went into
the Campe, where his enemies, the night before were lodged, and there
he founde many goodly peaces of ordenaūce, and inespecially one, called
Dygeon, named after the chief toune of Burgony, beside pauiliōs,
wine, beere, meale, and innumerable vitaill.

                   at sixe weekes ende, where thei were well refreasshed:

for in all this iorney, thei had litle plentie of good bread, whiche caused
muche faintnesse, and diuerse diseases in the army. When the Duke of
Gloucester, had sufficiently plagued and wasted the countreys of the
duke of Burgoyn, &amp; brought great preyes of beastes and spoyle, to the
toune of Calice, he settyng there all thynges in good ordre, returned in
to Englande, where he was aduertised, how Iames kyng of Scottes,
contrary to his othe, league, and promise, had besieged the Castle of
Rokesborough, with thirtie thousande men, whereof sir Raufe Graye
was capitain, whiche manfully defended it .xx. daies, but the Scottish
kyng beyng aduertised, that the Erle of Northumberlande, was commyng
to fight with hym, fledde with no lesse losse, then dishonor, to his
toune of Edenbrough.

                  AFter this daūgerous businesse finished, and for a time
ended, by meane of frendes, and desire of Princies, a
truce or abstinence of warre for a certaine tyme, was
moued betwene the Kyng of Englande, and the duke
of Burgoyne, for whiche cause wer sent to Grauelyne,
for the kyng of Englande, the Cardinall of Wynchester
Henry Beaufford, Ihon Lorde Moubrey Duke
of Norffolke, Humffrey Erle of Stafford, and diuerse other well learned
and honorable personages: and for the duke, there appe

At whiche treatie, a 
                     〈◊〉
                   was taken for a small tyme, and for a lesse
space obserued. Whiche abstinence of war, was concluded betwene the
Kyng of Englande, and the Duchesse of Burgoyne, (enterlessyng the
duke and his name.) Some thinke that the kyng of Englande, would
neuer entre in league with hym, because he had broken his promise,
writyng, and fidelitie, written, sealed, and sworne to hym, and to his father.
Other imagened, this to be doen by a cautell, to cast a myst before
the Frenche kynges iyes, to the intent he should beleue, that this feate
was wrought by the duchesse, without assent or knowledge of the duke
or his counsaill, and so he was not bounde to accomplishe, any acte or
thyng doen in his wifes treatie. Thus you maie se, that princies sometyme,
with suche vain gloses, and scornefull exposicions, wil hide their
doynges and cloke their purposes, to thentent that thei would not, either
be espied, or plucke their hedde out of the coller, at their pleasure.
But, (as the common prouerbe saieth) he, whiche is a promise breaker,
escapeth not alwaie free: for it is well sene▪ that daily it chaunceth,
bothe to princes and meane persones, that for breakyng of faithe, and
not kepyng of promise, many displeasures arise, and innumerable inconueniences
ensue.
               
                  ABOVT this season, Katheryne quene and mother to the kyng of
England, departed out of this transitory life, &amp; was buried by her husband,

in the mynster of Westmynster. This woman, after the death of
kyng Henry the fifth her husbande, beyng young and lusty, folowyng
more her awne appetite, then frendely counsaill, and regardyng more
her priuate affeccion, then her open honour, toke to husband priuily, a
goodly gentilman, &amp; a beautyful person, garnished with many Godly
gyftes, both of nature &amp; of grace, called Owen Teuther, a mā brought
furth and come of the noble lignage, and aūcient lyne of Cadwaleder,
the laste kyng of the Brytons, by whome she conceyued and broughte
forthe .iii. goodly sonnes, Edmond, Iasper, and another, whiche was a
monke in Westmynster, and lyued a smal tyme, and a doughter, which
in her youth departed out of this transitorie lyfe: After whose deathe
kynge Henry, because they were his bretherne of one wombe descēded,
created Edmonde, erle of Rychemonde, and Iasper, erle of Pembroke,
whiche Edmond engendered of Margaret, doughter and sole heyre to
Ihon, duke of Somerset, Hēry, which after was kyng of this realme,
called king Henry the seuenth, of whom you shal heare more hereafter.
Thys Owen, after the death of the Quene his wife, was apprehended
and cōmitted to ward, because that contrary to the statute made in the
vi. yere of this kyng, he presumptuously had maried the Quene, without
the kynges especiall assent, and agrement, out of which pryson he
escaped, and let out other with hym, and was agayne apprehendyd, &amp;
after escaped agayne.
               
                  THE duchesse of Bedford, sister to Lewes, erle of sainct Paule, myndyng
also to marye, rather for pleasure then for honour, without coū
                  sayl
of her frendes, maryed a lusty knyght, called sir Richarde Wooduile,
to the great displeasure of her vncle the bisshop of Tyrwyne, and
the erle her brother: but they now coulde not remedie it, for the chaūce
was cast and passed. This sir Richard, was made Barō of Riuers, and
after erle, and had by this Lady, many noble sonnes, and faire daughters:
whereof, one was Lady Elizabeth, after Quene of Englande, maried
to Kyng Edward the fourth, (as here after you shal perceiue.)
               
                  VVHILES this mariage was celebratyng, Iane late Quene of
Englande, and before Duchesse of Britayne, doughter to the Kyng of

the Countesse of Warwicke, and Henry Archebishop of Yorke.
               
                  I thought here to omit and ouerpasse, the regainyng and conquest of
the strong toune of Harflew, once Englishe and after, (by craft) turned
to the Frenche part, except the Frenche writers, more then the English
auth
                     •
                  rs, had made mencion and remembraunce, of the reduccion of the
same. For thei saie and affirme, that the Duke of Somerset, accompanied
with the Lordes of Fauconbridge, Talbot, sir Franceis Surrien
Arragonoys, Mathew Gough, Thomas Paulet, Thomas Haringtō
Walter Limbrike, Ihon Geddyng, William Watton, Esquieres, and
Thomas Hylton Bailife of Roan, with a great puissaunce of the English

partie, compassed about and besieged the toune of Harflew, bothe
by water, and by land. The capitaine within the toune, was called sir
Ihon Desto
                     •
                  teuile, and sir Robert his brother, with other, to the nombre
of sixe hundred good fightyng men. The assailauntes lost no tyme,
but made trenches, and cast diches, bothe to assaute the toune, and also
to let the Frenche succors, that thei should neither approche, nor ayde
the citezens shut in &amp; besieged. Diuerse assautes wer geuen, which wer
manfully resisted: but more to the losse of the defenders, then the assauters.
Beside this, the Englishemen laied greate ordinaunce, before the
gate of the toune, whiche continually vexed the inhabitaūtes, and ouer
threwe buyldynges, and destroyed mancions: so that neither hous, nor
high waie was sure, or refuge to the tounes men. This siege endured
long, to the greate discomfiture of the people: whereof thei aduertised
the Frenche kyng and his counsaill, whiche sent thither the erle of ewe,
therle of Dumoys, called the Bastard of Orleaunre, the valeaunt Bastard
of Burbon, the lorde Gaucort, sir Giles of sent Symon, and the
chief capitaines of all his realme, with foure thousand men, bothe pollitique
and proued. This valeaunt armie passed the Riuer of Soame
betwene Amyas and Corby, not mistrustyng to gette that, whiche thei
lost and left behynd theim, and so thei came before the toune, and diuided
thēselfes in seuerall partes, to their moste aduauntage: daily skirmishyng
with thenglishmen, but nothyng preuailyng, &amp; so for feare of
losyng honor, and desperacion of gain, the florishyng Frenchemen, returned
again with muche labor, and litle profit. The capitaines of the
toune seyng theire pillers borken, and their chief ayders discomfited▪
rendered the toune to the duke of Somerset, whiche made there capitaines,
Thomas Paulet, William Lymbrike, Cristopher Barker, and
George sent George, whiche many yeres, (till the deuision beganne in
Englande) manfully &amp; valeauntly defended the toune, and hauen: but
afterward, when the saied duke was Regent, and gouernor of Normā

he not onely loste the toune, but also the citee of Roan, the Empeire
and chief iuell of thesaied Duchie, with many other citees and fortresses,
whiche he, more by entreatyng, then threatenyng, might still haue
holden vnder his subiecciō. But all men haue not wit alike, nor all rulers
be not of one condicion and pollicie. For this duke Edmond, gatte
this toune, with great glory, when he was but a deputie, vnder the Regent,
and after, beyng gouernor himself, lost thesame, and al the whole
duchie, to his greate slaunder and infamy, (as hereafter you shall perceiue).
But, who can preuent fortunes chaunce, or haue spectacles to se

                  ALTHOVGH I haue long talked of Fraunce, yet I may not forget
the double dealyng, &amp; craftie demeanor, of Iames Kyng of Scottes:
whiche beyng, (as you haue heard) late prisoner in Englande, not

onely was garnished with learnyng and Ciuilitie, (whiche thynges,
wer rare and straunge before that time, within the realme of Scotlād)
but also set at libertie, and honorably sent home. And to the intent that
his amitie might be perpetuall, and that loue might continually succeade
betwene bothe the realmes, by his meane and accord: firste, his
greate raunsome was abbridged, and diminished, and after, he was
ioyned in mariage, with one of the bloud royal, to thentent that he, and
his heires, should be vnited and knit, to the progeny of England, with
an indissoluble knot, like the twisted tree, whiche cannot seuer, and like
the hard flinte, whiche will not waxe soft: yet this vngentle prince, and
forgetfull frend, puttyng in obliuion, bothe the dutie of his obeysaūce,
toward his souereigne and liege lorde, and the oth and promise, that he
made to kyng Henry, when he did to hym homage, and liege at the Castle
of Wyndesore, (as before you haue heard) turned his backe to his
frend and kynsman, and loked to y• French part, whiche neuer did hym
honor nor profite, not onely sendyng into Fraunce daily, aide &amp; succors
against the Englishe nacion, but also by newe alliaunce, sought and
practised waies and meanes, how to ioyne himself with forein princes,
to greue and hurte his neighbors and adioynauntes, of the realme of
England. And although his awne power wer small, to do to them any
great damage, yet he thought that he, being linked in suche noble houses,
should the lesse feare the malice of his enemies: vpon whiche fe
                     •
                  le
foundacion, he concluded .ii. mariages, the one with Lewes the dolphin
sonne to Charles the Frenche kyng, and the other with Fraunces duke
of Britayn. Whiche mariages, were not desired for loue or riches, but
onely for ayde, to resist and driue out the Englishmen out of Fraunce.
For the Lady Margeret maried to the dolphyn, was of suche nasty cō
                  plexion
and euill sauored breathe, that he abhorred her company, as a
cleane creature, dooth a carion: whereupon she conceiued suche an inward
grief, that within fewe daies after, she ended her daies. Although
this lady had suche impedimentes, (as you haue heard) yet her sister Isabell,
maried to Fraunces duke of Britayne, lacked, neither excedyng
beautie, nor pleasaunt breathe: but as for wit, womanhod, and Ciuile
behauor, she neuer had, nor excercised. Wherfore, when the duke before
his mariage, was by his counsaill admonished, to refuse and forsake so
innocent a creature, he, more moued with her faire face, then her womā
                  ly
wisedome, aunswered: that it was ynough for a woman, to iudge the
difference betwene the shurte and the dublet of her husbande, and to
knowe hym in the darke, from another man.
               
                  FOR these mariages, kyng Iames demaunded of his commons, a
greate subsidye or tallage, whiche was sore grudged at, and in maner
denied: so that he maried theim, with faire promises, and ayde and succor
against thenglishemen, rather then with bagges of money, or chestes
of plate. This forein alliaunce litle profited, or auayled the realme
of Scotland, nor this new amitie, defended not kyng Iames: for Walter

Steward erle of Athole, (whiche pretended a title to the Croune, by
reason that he was begotten of kyng Robert the seconde, by his firste
wife, and by whose occasion, Robert duke of Albany, murdered Dauid
duke of Rothesay, elder brother to this kyng Iames, as in the story
of kyng Henry the fourth, you haue heard declared) after the coronaciō
of kyng Iames the first in Scotlande, earnestly sollicited hym to putt
to death, duke Murdo, and all the ofspryng of Robert first duke of Albany,
trustyng, that after he had destroyed that line, (which was a stop
in his waie) to inuent some meane how to destroy the kyng and his children,
and so to obtain the croune and preeminence of the realme. Wherfore,
he perswaded Robert Steward his nephiew, and Robert Grame
his cosyn, and diuerse other, to murther and sley the kyng their souereigne
Lorde, whiche therto by deuilishe instigacion incensed and procured,
came to the toune of Pertho, (commonly called S. Ihōs toune)
and there entred into the kynges priuy chambre, and slewe first diuerse
of his seruauntes, whiche made resistance, &amp; after, killed the Kyng with
many mortall strokes, and hurte the Quene, whiche, in defence of her
husband, felled one of the traytors. When this vngracious deede was
blowen about the toune, the people rose in greate plumpes, and found
out the princequellers, and theim brought to straight prisone, whiche
afterward, (accordyng to their desertes) wer with most terrible tormentes,
put to death and executed.
               
                  AFTER Iames the first, succeded Iames the seconde, his eldest
sonne, whiche fearyng sedicion and ciuile discord, vexed more his awne
nacion, then the Englishe people.
               
                  NOVV leauyng Scotland, let vs returne to the busines of Fraūce.
Whiles the Scottes wer compassyng, how to destroy their kyng: The
lorde Talbot, with a greate company, laied siege to the Castle of Tankeruile,
whiche after foure monethes, was to hym simplie rendred, and
gyuen vp. This toune was no greate gain to the Englishemen: for in
the meane season, the Frenche kyng in his awne persone, besieged the
strong toune of Monstreaue Faultyou, whereof Thomas Gerard was
capitain: whiche, more for desire of rewarde, then for feare of enemies,
sold the toune to the Frenche Kyng, and had of hym greate giftes, and
good chere, whiche afterwarde was well knowen, to his shame and reproche.
This toune had been rescued, or the Frenche Kyng foughten
with all, if one chaunce had not happened: for the duke of Yorke was
discharged of the office of Regent, and the erle of Warwicke preferred
to thesame, so that the duke of Yorke liyng at Roan, would haue gladly
rescued the toune, if his authoritie had not surceased, and the Erle of
Warwicke could not, for the wind was so cleane cōtray to hym, that he
and his army, taried for the winde aboue tenne wekes. And so betwene
the discharge of the one, and the charge of the other, this toune of Mō
                  streau,
was deliuered and solde.
               
                  THIS presente yere, was a parliament kepte at Westminster, in the

whiche wer diuerse notable conclusions ordained and taken, aswell for
the preseruacion of peace and concord at home, as for the maintenaūce
of warre, and hostilitie in outward regions: in the whiche parliament,
(who so will loke on the actes) shall perceiue that one act made, for byyng
&amp; sellyng by straūgers, was profitable to the publique wealth of
this realme, if it wer wel kept, (as a few good actes or none be either by
the negligēce of y• gouernors, or by the insolencie &amp; pride of the people.)
               
                  NOVV must we speake somewhat of Charles the Frenche Kyng:
whiche after he had gained again the citee of Paris, and diuerse other
tounes, was so puffed vp with pride, that he thought it but a trifle, to
conquere Normandy, and expulse all the Englishe nacion, out of his
countreys and seigniories. Wherfore, he sent Arthur of Britayn, Constable
of Fraunce, &amp; Ihō duke of Alāson, into Normandy with a great
army, whiche besieged the toune of Auraūches, standyng vpō the knop
of an hill, nere to the Britishe sea, bothe well walled and well manned.
While thei laie there long, litle gettyng and muche spendyng, the lorde
Talbot with a valeaunt company of men, approched nere the Frenche
men, and encamped themselfes, in the face of their enemies, to prouoke
and entise them to battail and fight. The Frenchmen refusyng this offre,
kept theimselfes within their trenches, daily fortifiyng and repairyng
their campe. The Englishemen perceiuyng their doynges, remoued
their army halfe a mile farther, geuyng their enemies come to issue
out and to fight, but all this litle auailed: for the Frenchemen laye
still and stirred not. The lorde Talbot, seyng their faint hartes, reysed
his feld, and in the open sight of them all, entred into the toune, and the
next daie issued out, and founde the Frenchemen ridyng abrode, to destroye
the plain countrey, whom he enuironed, bet, and discomfited, slayng
many, and takyng diuerse prisoners. Although the Frēchemen gat
neither honor nor profite by this iorney▪ yet thei enterprised a greater
matter: for Ponthon of Sentrayles and the Heire, with diuerse other
capitaines, and a great nombre of Frenchmen, hauyng promise of certain
Burgesses of Roan, to be let secretly into the toune, came forward
to a village, called Ryse, and there lodged. The lorde Talbot, the lorde
Scales, and sir Thomas Kiriell, hearyng of their approche, set out of
Roan at midnight, and with greate pain, came to Rise in the mornyng
so couertly, that the Frenchemen, beyng sodainly surprised and set on,
like men madd and amased, ran away, &amp; fled: in the chase wer taken the
lord of Fontaynes, sir Alleyne Geron, sir Lewes de Balle, &amp; .lx. knightes
and esquires, beside other, and ther wer flain, two hundred and mo:
the Heire beyng sore wounded, by the swiftnes of his horsse, escaped very
narowly. The Englishmen returned to the toune of Rise, and found
there a greate nombre of horsses, and other baggages, whiche thei ioyously
brought with them to Roan.
            
            
               ¶The .xvi. yere.
               
                  
                  ON the sixt daie of Nouembre,The xvi. yere this present yere, the erle
of Warwicke, as regent of Fraunce, passed the sea, after
he had been seuen tymes shipped and vnshipped,
and landed at Humflewe, with a .M. freashe souldiors
and came to Roan, and then the duke of Yorke, returned
into Englande, neither wholy pleased, nor halfe
content. For he secretly smelled, that some men, priuely
disdained his aduauncement, and enuied his promociō: yet, (like a wise
man) he kept his toung close, whatsoeuer his harte thought. Betwene
the chaunge of these twoo capitaines, the duke of Burgoyne, (whiche
sore enuied the glory of thenglishmen) besieged the Castle of Croytoy,
with tenne thousande men and mo, hauyng with hym greate plentie of
gonnes, and goodly ordenaunce. The Erle of Warwicke hearyng of
this feate, sent the lorde Talbot, the lorde Fawconbridge, sir Thomas
Kiriell, sir Ihon Mountgomery, Thomas Limbricke, Thomas Chā
                  dos,
Dauy Halle, and diuerse other knightes and esquiers, and many
tall yeomen, to the nombre of fiue thousand men, whiche passed the Riuer
of Soame, beside the toune of S. Ualery: for the passage of Blāch
Taque, was very daūgerous to go through, because the duke of Burgoyne
had laied there ordinaunce, and other engyns, to let, trouble and
stoppe the Englishemen to go ouer at that foorde. And yet, where the
lord Talbot passed, his men went in the water vp to the chinne, so glad
wer the men to rescew their felowes. When the duke of Burgoyn was
enformed of the approchyng of the lorde Talbot and other, he with all
his power, sauyng foure hundred, whiche wer left in a bastile, by hym
there newly buylded fled to Abbeuile, whiche bastile was sone gained,
and the men within, either slain or taken.
               
                  AFTER this toune receiued, the lorde Talbot sente woorde to the
duke of Burgoyn, that he would vtterly wast and destroy the coūtrey
of Pycardy, except he, (like a valeaunt prince) would geue him battail.
And accordyng to his promise, he brent tounes, spoyled, and slewe many
people in Pycardy, but for all his doynges, the duke would not appere,
but stale awaie from Abbeuile, and fled to Amyas. So the Lorde
Talbot was .xx. daies full, in the countreis of Pycardy, and Arthoyse,
destroiyng and burnyng, all that thei could se or come to, and after departed.
And in the meane season, sir Thomas Kiriell had gotten all the
dukes cariages, and ordenaunce, and left asmuche vitaile in the toune
of Croytoy, as would serue sixe hundred men a whole yere, and conueyed
the remnaunt in safetie, to the erle of Warwicke, whiche not onely,
receiued the capitaines, with good semblaunce, and louing cheare, but
also highly magnified their actes, and muche praised their hardinesse.
               
                  AFTER this enterprise achiued, Henry Erle of Mortaine sonne to
Edmond duke of Somerset, arriued at Chierbuege, with foure hundred
archers, and thre hundred speres, and passed through Normandy,
till he came into the Countie of Mayne, where, he besieged a castle, called

S. Anyan, in the whiche wer three C. Scottes, beside Frenchemen.
This Castle he toke by a strong assaut, and slewe all the Scottes, and
hanged the Frenchmen, because thei wer once sworne English, and after,
brake their othe: and after he gatte also another Castle, twoo miles
from sainct Iulians, called Alegerche, which was shortly after recouered,
and the Lorde Cameuys, whiche came to the rescue of thesame, in
the meane waie was trapped and taken. Thus the victory flowed some
tyme on the one parte, and sometyme on the other, but the treason of the
Frenchmen, far surmounted in gettyng, bothe the pollicy and strength
of the Englishe capitaines: for by the vntruth and perfidy, of the very
Burgesses and inhabitaūtes of the tounes, of Meaux in Brie, and. S.
Susanne, thesame wer, sold and deliuered to the Frenche parte, in the
ende of this sixtene yere.

                  WHat should I reherse the great tempestes, the sharpe
blastes, the sodain piries, the vnmesurable wyndes,
the continuall raynes, whiche fell and chaunced this
yere in England: sithe suche tormentes be bothe naturall,
and of God, at his pleasure diuersly ordered
and altred. Of these vntemperate stormes, rose suche
a scacety, that wheat was sold at .iii.s.iiii.d. the busshell,
wine at .xii.d. the gallon, Bay salt at .xiiij.d. the busshel, and malt
at xiij.s.iiij.d. the quarter, and all other graynes, wer sold of an excessiue
price, aboue the olde custome.
               
                  IN the moneth of Iune, the Erle of Huntyngdone, (as Stewarde
of Guyen) with twoo .M. archers, and foure hundred speres, was sente
into Gascoyne, as a suppliment to the countrey, and the commons of
thesame. For the kyng of England and his coūsaill, wer enformed that
therle of Dumoys, lay on y• fronters of Tholose, secretly by rewardes
and faire promises, entisyng and prouoking diuerse tounes in Guyen,
to become French, and leaue thenglishe naciō. Wherfore, this erle (like
a pollitique warrior) altered not onely the capitaines, in euery toune &amp;
cite, but also remoued the magistrates, and chaunged the officers, from
toune to toune, and from rowme to rowme, so that by this meanes at
that tyme, the erle of Dumoys, lost bothe trauaile and cost. In thesame
moneth also, sir Richard Wooduile, six William Chāberlain, sir William
Peyto, and sir William Story, with a .M. men, wer lent to stuffe
the tounes in Normandy, whiche surely at that tyme, had therof greate
nede: for thenglish capitaines, had smal confidence in the Normās, and
not to much, in some of their awne nacion. For that harlot bribery, and
her felowe couetuousnes, ran so fast abrode with French crounes, that
vnneth any creature, (without an especial grace) could hold either hād,
close, or pursse shut, suche a strong percer is money, and suche a gredie
glotton is auarice. You haue heard before, howe that Kyng Charles

harte by gettyng of Paris, was set vpon a merie pynne, and thought
daily that all thynges more and more, would bothe applie to his purpose,
and folowe his appetite. Whiche inuented imaginacion, sodainly
bothe deceiued hym, and also appalled his haut corage, and abate
                     •
                  
hym somewhat of his proude stomacke. For 
                     •
                  odainly there rose a
straunge storme, and a quicke pirie, so mischeuous and so pernicious,
that nothyng more execrable, or more to be abhorred, could happen in
any Christian Region. Whiche sedicious tempest, if wise counsail had
not with al spede repressed, no doubt, but kyng Charles, and the whole
publique wealthe of Fraunce, had been turned vp, and cleane ouerthrowen.
For Lewes Dolphyn of Uyen, and heire apparaunt to kyng
Charles, a yong prince, of a froward stomacke and euil condicions, desiryng
libertie, and to be out of ward and rule, with suche as wer of his
nature and condicions, began to conspire against his father, and souereigne
lorde. The chief of this vngracious faccion with hym, wer Ihō
Duke of Alaunson, and Ihon Duke of Burbon. These confederates
gathered together a greate power, and the Dolphyn tooke vpon hym,
the rule and gouernaunce of the realme, orderyng causes, not in his fathers
name, nor by his authoritie, but after his awne wil, affeccion, and
phantasie. When kyng Charles his father, had knowledge of this vnnaturall
disobedience, and insolent and proude doynges, he was (&amp; no
maruel) greatly moued with this sodain commociō: thinkyng hymself
borne, &amp; predestinate to trouble, remēbryng, that it was no smal thyng,
in his awne countrey so many yeres, both with straungers, &amp; with his
awne naciō, to fight and striue for rule and dignitie, but now to be cō
                  strained,
to contend &amp; make war, with his awne sonne and welbeloued
child, for the Croune and regiment, of his realme &amp; dominion. Yet these
thynges did not bryng hym, beyng a man of greate wit, and counsaill,
daily troubled and vnquieted with calamities and displeasures, into
vtter despaire, or extreme wanhope: but like a pollitique prince, determinyng
to withstand and resist, the smoke at the beginnyng, before the
fire &amp; flame 
                     •
                  rast out abrode, called together all suche, as he had either
in greate confidence, or especiall fauor, communicatyng to them, al his
inward thoughtes, and priuie cogitacions. After long consultacion
had, it was agreed by the moste parte, that this sore was more mete to
be cured, by pollitique and wittie handelyng, rather then by force, and

                     •
                  ent of sweard. Wherfore, letters wer written, and postes wer sent to euery
citee and borough, straightly prohibityng all and synguler persones,
either to heare, or obey, any precept or commaundement, set furthe
or published, by the dolphyn hymself, or by other, or in his name, and al
offences doen in that confederacie, wer by open proclamacion, frely for
geuen and remitted. And beside this, diuerse graue and sage persones,
wer sent to the dolphyn, and his alies, to common and cōclude a peace,
and reconciliacion, betwene the Frenche kyng and theim, declaryng to
them, that their ciuile war, and inward discencion, was the very meane

to cause their enemies, vtterly to plague and destroy their natiue countrey,
whiche was almoste desolate, and brought into subieccion, by the
continual warre practised before. By whiche meanes and perswasions,
the knot of this sedicious facciō, was losed and dissolued: and the kyng
with his sonne, and other confederates, openly agreed and apparaūtly
pacified. And so the spryng of these mischiuous secte, was stopped and
repulsed, or the flodde had any thyng encreased, or flowen farther.
               
                  THE Englishmen (whiche euer sought their aduauntage) hearyng
of this domesticall diuision in the realme of Fraunce, raised an armye,
and recouered again diuerse tounes, whiche wer stollen from theim before,
by the French nacion: and made great prouision, to recouer again
the citee of Paris, but when thei heard, that the dolphyn was returned
again to his father, and that all his mates, wer ioyned with the French
kyng, thei left of from that enterprise, and reuoked their purpose.
            
            
               ¶The .xviii. yere.The .xviii. yere.
               
               
                  IN the moneth of Nouembre this presente yere, there was
suche a great Frost, and after that, so depe a Snowe, that
all the ground was couered with white, and al the diches
hardened and frosen, whiche weather put the Englishemen
in comfort, to recouer again the toune of Ponthoise,
by the Frenche kyng gotten before, by corruptyng with money, diuerse
Burgesses of the toune. Wherfore, the Englishemen beyng clothed all
in white, with Ihon lorde Clifforde their capitain, came in the night to
the diches, and passed theim without daungier, by reason of the Froste,
and sodainly scaled the walles, slewe the watche, and tooke the toune,
with many profitable prisoners. When this toune was thus gotten,
lorde Richard Beauchampe erle of Warwicke and Regent of Fraūce,
died in the Castle of Roan, and was conueyed into England, and with
solempne Ceremonies, was buried in his College of Warwicke, in 
                     •
                  
verie solempne and sumptuous sepulture.
               
                  THEN was the duke of Yorke again, made regent of Fraunce, whiche
accompanied with therle of Oxford, the lorde Bourchier, called erle
of Ewe, Sir Iames of Ormond, the Lorde Clinton, and diuerse other
noble men, sailed into Normandy: Before whose arriuall, the Frenche
kyng beyng sore greued with the takyng of the toune of Pounthoyse,
assembled a great army, and besieged thesaid toune hymself, and made
round about it, bastiles, trenches, &amp; diches, and daily shot ordenaunce,
and gaue therunto diuerse greate and fierce assautes. But Ihon lorde
Clifford, like a valeaunt capit
                     •
                  in, defended the toune with suche valeauntnes,
that the Frenchemen rather lost then gayned. The Duke of
Yorke at his landyng, hauing true knowledge of this siege, sent for the
lorde Talbot, and a great nombre of souldiors, and so came nere to the
toune of Pounthoyse, and there encamped hymself, and sent woorde to
the Frenche Kyng, that he was there, ready to geue hym battaill, if he

would come out of his campe and Bastiles. Kyng Charles was ruled
by his counsaill, whiche in no wise would suffre hym to aduenture his
persone, with men of so lowe and base degree: biddyng hym remembre,
what losses he and his auncesters had susteined, by geuyng to the
Englishemen battaill: whiche thyng thei principally desire, willyng
hym to kepe his ground still, and to bid th
                     •
                  im entre at their perell, and
in the meane season, to stoppe the passage of the Riuer of Oy
                     •
                  e, so that
no vitaile could be brought to the Englishe army by that way, by whiche
meanes, he should not onely obtein his purpose, but also cause the
Englishemen to recule backe again, for lacke of vitaile and succors.
The Duke of Yorke perceiuyng, that the Frenche kyng was nothyng
mynded to 
                     •
                  ight, determined to passe ouer the Riuer of Oyse, and so to
fight with hym in his lodgyng, wherupon he remoued his campe, and
appoynted the lord Talbot and other, to make a countenaunce, as thei
would passe the Riuer by force at the gate of Beaumont, and appoynted
another cōpany with boates, of tymbre &amp; ledder, and bridges made
of cordes and ropes, (whereof he had greate plentie, caried with hym in
Chariottes) to passe ouer the Riuer by neth the Abbay. While the lord
Talbot made a crye, as though he would assaile the gate, certain Englishmen
passed the water ouer in boates, and drew the bridge ouer, so
that a greate nombre wer comen ouer, or the Frenchemen them espied.
When thei sawe the chaunce, thei ran like mad men, to stoppe the passage,
but their labor was loste, and all their pain to no purpose: for the
moste parte of thenglishe people wer sodainly transported, in so muche
that thei chased their enemies, by fine force into the toune again, and
toke sir Guylliam de Chastell, nephieue to the Lorde Canehy, and diuerse
other gentlemen prisoners. The Frenchmen seyng their damage
irrecuperable, returned to the Frenche kyng, accomptyng to hym their
euil chaūce &amp; vnluckey fortune, which therwith was not a litle displeasaūt:
and wel perceiuyng, that if he taried the cōmyng of thenglishmen
he was like to be either in greate ieoperdy, or sure to sustein muche dishonor
and greate damage. Wherefore he remouid his ordinaunce into
the bastile of. S. Martyn, whiche he had newly made, and leauyng
behynd hym the lorde of Cotigny, 
                     •
                  dmirall of Fraunce, with thre .M.
men to kepe the bastiles, dislodged in the night from Maubuisson, and
came to Poissye: for if he had taried still in that place, the lorde Talbot
with certain of his trustie souldiors, whiche passed the riuer of Oyse in
ii. smal lether boates, had either slain or taken hym, in his lodgyng, the
same night. The Englishemen the next daie in good ordre of battaill,
came before the toune of Pounthoise, thinkyng there to haue founde
the Frenche kyng, but he was gone, and in his lodgyng, thei founde
greate riches, and muche stuffe, whiche he could not haue space, to conuey,
for feare of the sodain inuasion. Then the Duke of Yorke with his
company, entered into the toune, and sent for newe vitaill, and repaired
the toures and bulwerkes about the toune, and diuerse tymes assailed

the Bastile of the Frenchemen, of the whiche he passed not greatly, because
thei were not of power, either to assaut, or stoppe the vitailes or
succors from the toune. The Duke liyng thus in the toune of Ponthoise,
was aduertised, that the Frenche kyng and the dolphyn, with all
the nobilitie of Fraunce, wer lodged in Poissye, wherfore he intendyng
once again to offre hym battaill, left behynd hym there, for capitain, sir
Geruays Clifton, with a thousande souldiors, and remoued his army
and came before Poysye, and set hymself and his men in good ordre of
battaill, redy to fight. There issued out diuerse gentlemen, to skirmish
with the Englishemen, but thei were sone discomfited, and foure valeaunt
horssemen wer taken prisoners, and diuerse slain. The Englishemen
perceiuyng the faynte hartes, and colde corage of their enemies,
whiche nothyng lesse desired, then to encountre with the Englishnacion
in open felde, dislodged from Poysye, and came to Mante, and sone
after to Roan.
               
                  VVHEN the Regent and the lorde Talbot, wer returned again into
Normandy, the Frenche kyng (for all this euill lucke) forgat not the
toune of Ponthoise, and firste he considered, what charges he had susteined,
bothe duryng the tyme of the siege, and also in makyng bastyles,
trenches, and other deuises: and after remembred, that his people,
and especially the Parisians (to whō this toune was an euil neighbor)
would rayle and saie, that he was not able, or lacked corage, to gette so
small a toune, or to discomfite halfe a hādfull of amased people. Wherfore
these thynges set in ordre, he assembled all his puyssaunce, and returned
sodainly again to Ponthoise: where, he firste by assaute gat the
churche, and after the whole toune, and toke the capitain prisoner, and
diuerse other Englishemen, and slewe to the nombre of foure hundred,
whiche derely sold their lifes: for one Frenche writer affirmeth, that the
Frenche kyng lost there, thre .M. men and mo, and the whole garrison
of the Englishemen, was onely a .M: so thei gayned the toune, but thei
gat no gr
                     •
                  ate boty of men. When the fame of this victory was blowen
abrode, the hartes of the tounes men, began to appall, in somuche, that
Melune, Corbuell, Eureux, and diuerse other tounes, yelded and turned
at a proude crake, or a Frenche bragge, without stroke striken, or
any blowe gyuen.
               
                  AFTER these hote rages, the wether began to waxe more temperate
for kyng Hēry and kyng Charles, wer agreed, to send Ambassadors, to
common and treate some good peace &amp; conclusiō, betwene them, &amp; their
realmes. So the kyng of England, sent the Cardinall of Wynchester,
with diuers
                     •
                   other noble personages of his counsaill, to Calice, with
whom was also sent, Charles Duke of Orleaunce, yet prisoner in England,
to thentent that he might be both the author of y• peace, and procurer
of his deliueraunce. The Frenche kyng, sent the Archebishop of
Reyns, and the Erle of Dumoys: and the Duke of Burgoyne, sent the
lorde Cre
                     •
                  ecuer, and diuerse other, because that the duke of Orleaunce

was passed the sea with the Englishe Ambassadors, thei would mete in
none other place to commen, but in Calice. The Frenche Ambassadors
perceiuyng their mynde, came to Calice, where the duke of Orleaunce,
gently receiued therle of Dumoys (his bastard brother) thankyng him
hartely for his pain taken, in gouernyng his coūtrey duryng the tyme
of his captiuitie and absence. Diuerse communicacions wer had, aswel
for the deliueraunce of the duke, as for a finall peace: in somuche, that
after muche consultyng, and litle doyng, another tyme was appoynted
for a newe assembly, and euery parte to declare to their souereigne, the
request and desire of the other. So these Ambassadors toke their leaue
and departed, and thenglishe commissioners conueyed again the duke
of Orleaunce into England, whiche had nothyng then to paie his raū
                  some,
&amp; yet he could not be deliuered, without paiment. The cause why
these cōmissioners did not agre, was, (as the Frenche writers saie) that
the Englishemen demaunded, not onely to haue and possesse peaceably
the ii. Duchies of Aquitayn and Normandy, to their kynges &amp; princes
discharged of all resort, superioritie, and souereigntie, frākly and frely,
against the realme of Fraūce, the kynges and gouernors of thesame for
euer: but also required to be restored to al the tounes, citees, and possessions,
whiche thei, within .xxx. yeres next before gone and past, had conquered
in the realme of Fraunce. The Englishemen, thought that thei
demaunded but right and reason: and the Frenchemen, thought their
request to be most hurtfull to their realme, and aūcient glory. So both
parties, rather myndyng to gain or saue, then to lose, departed for that
tyme, (as you haue heard). After which diet proroged for a tyme, Phillip
Duke of Burgoyn, partly moued in cōscience, to make some amendes
&amp; recompence to Charles duke of Oleaunce (then being prisoner in
Englande) for the death of duke Lewes his father (whom duke Ihon,
father to this duke Phillip, shamefully slewe, and cruelly murdered in
the citee of Paris, (as in the tyme of kyng Henry the fourth, is plainly
mencioned) And partly entendyng the aduauncement of his niece, lady
Marie doughter to Adolphe, Duke of Cleue, by the whiche aliaunce,
he trusted surely to knit, such a firme knot and frendly amitie with the
Duke of Orleaunce, that all olde rancor should cease, and all discorde
should be forgotten: and in their places, concorde should be stablished,
and perpetuall loue embraced) sente messengers into Englande, to the
saied duke, declaryng to hym his good will, deuise, and entent. Thinke
not but this message, was ioyous to a captiue, beyng out of his natiue
countrey, and naturall seigniorie, by the space of .xxv. yeres? Suppose
you that he, which nothyng more coueted and desired, then libertie and
discharge, wold refuse so honorable an offre? Imagin you that a prince
of a bloud royal, brought into thraldome, restrained frō liberty and liuyng,
farre from kyn and father, &amp; farther from frēdes, would not geue
his diligent eare to that mocion, by the whiche he might be restored,
bothe to his auncient preheminence, possession and seigniory? Yes, yes,

you maie be sure, he neither cōsulted on the matter, nor deferred the aū
                  swere,
but therunto gently agreed. What should I saie more? As some
writers affirme, foure hundred thousande Crounes were paied for his
deliueraunce, although other saie, but thre hundred thousande: and so
he was deliuered out of Englande into Fraunce at that tyme, bothe
speakyng better Englishe then Frenche, and also swearyng, neuer to
beare Armure against the Kyng of Englande. After his arriuall in
Fraunce, he came to the Duke of Burgoyne, his especiall frend, gratifiyng
and thankyng hym of his libertie and deliueraunce: and accordyng
to his promes and cōuencion, maried the faire lady in the toune
of sainct Omers, on whom he begat a sonne, whiche after was Frenche
kyng, and called Lewes the .xii. After his deliueraunce from captiuitie
he forgat not his vncle Ihon Erle of Angolesme, whiche had been as a
pledge in England, for the debt of Duke Lewes of Orleaunce, his father,
sithe the laste yere of kyng Henry the fourth, (as in his story is declared):
but made frendes, borowed money, and morgaged land, and so
set hym at libertie, and brought hym into his countrey. This Ihon, engendered
Charles, father to Fraunces, the firste of that name, whiche
after the death of Lewes the .xij, obteined the Croune of Fraunce.
               
                  HERE is to be noted, that olde rauncor newly appeaced, will commonly
spryng out again: for although the vnhappie deuision, betwene
the two noble families, of Orleaunce and Burgoyn, wer by this great
benefite and mariage, for a tyme geuen ouer and put in Obliuion, and
so continued by the space of .xx. yeres and more, yet their children and
cosyns, within, not many yeres after, fell so far at square, that the hous
of Burgoyne, was spoyled of the fairest flower of his garland, (as you
shall here afterwarde, at large declared) and in especiall, in the tyme
of kyng Fraunces the firste, the verie heire of the hous of Orleaunce,
whiche not onely continually vexed with mortall warre, Charles the
fift Emperor of that name, lineall successor to Phillip Duke of Burgoyne:
but also did asmuche as in hym laye, to depriue thesaid Charles
of his honor, and possessions, (as men writyng their lifes, wil hereafter
declare). The Frenche writers affirme, that this Duke of Orleaunce,
was deteined thus long in captiuitie, by reason that the Englishemen,
gayned yerely by hym, greate somes of money, by reason of his greate
and liberall expenses, whiche he made daily in the realme of England.
If this be true, I report me to all indifferent and reasonable persones,
for who will spende his goodes frely, in the lande of his enemie, whiche
maie by pinchyng and bearyng a lowe saile, waxe riche and be set at libertie?
Or who is so proude to wast &amp; consume his substaūce, in liuyng
prodigally, that maie with the sparyng of thesame, be deliuered out of
captiuitie and bōdage? But surely it is apparaunt, that the reuenewes
of his seigniories, wer neither able to raunsome hym, nor to mainteyne
hym in pōpeous estate: partly, because thenglishmen possessed diuerse
tounes, belongyng to his Duchy: and partly, by reason that the rentes

wer scace able to defende his possessions, against the inuasions of the
Englishe nacion, and Burgonions. But the very cause of his long deteinyng
wer two: one, the lacke of money, the second and the principall
cause, was this, that you haue heard before, how that Ihon Duke of
Burgoyne father to Phillippe, shamefully and cruelly, caused Lewes
Duke of Orleaunce, father to this Duke Charles, (of whom we nowe
speake) to be murthered in the citee of Paris: for the whiche murder, al
the alies and frendes to the Duke of Orleaunce, had enuie against the
hous and familie of Burgoyne, in somuche that thesaied Duke Ihon,
b
                     •
                  yng measured with thesame measure, that he met with all, was likewise
tyrannou
                     •
                  ly murdered on the bridge of Mounstreau Faultyou,
(as you haue also heard declared before). For whiche cause, and for to
be reuenged of so heynous an act, duke Phillip sonne to thesaid Ihon,
not onely ioyned hymself, in league and amitie with the Englishe nacion,
but also did homage, and sweare fealtie to Kyng Henry the fifth,
as to his Kyng and souereigne Lorde: for whiche cause, the Englishemen
entendyng to kepe the duke of Burgoyn, as a trusty treasure, and
sure Iuell, perceiued, that if thei deliuered the duke of Orleaunce, and
set hym at libertie, he would not cease to vexe and trouble the duke of
Burgoyne, in reuengyng the detestable murder, committed by his father
against his parent: wherfore, bothe for the surety and sauegard of
the duke of Burgoyne, and also to do hym pleasure, thei kepte still the
duke of Orleaunce in Englande, demaundyng suche raunsome, as he
was neither able, nor could finde meanes or waies to paie. But after
that the duke of Burgoyn, (like an vntrue prince and vnhonest gentleman)
had broken his promes, not kept his faith, and was turned to the
Frenche part, the counsaill of the kyng of Englande, studied and deuised,
how to deliuer the duke of Orleaunce, to do displeasure to the duke
of Burgoyn. Duke Phillip perceiuyng, what mischief was like to rise
if he wer redemed, and set at libertie without his knowledge, to preuēte
the matter, to his greate coste and charge, practised his deliueraunce,
paied his raūsome, and ioyned with him, amitie and alliance, by mariage
of his niece, (as before is rehersed) and by this meanes, was Duke
Charles of Orleaunce, restored to his libertie, whiche had been prisoner
in England, from the daie of sainctes, Crispin
                     •
                   &amp; Crispinian, in the

                  IN the beginnyng of this .xix. yere, Richard duke of Yorke
Regent of Fraunce, and gouernor of Normandy, remembryng
the greate charge, and weightie office to hym deliuered
and committed, determined, (after long consultacion)
to inuade the territories of his enemies, bothe by sondery
armies, and in diuerse places, to thentent that the Frenche people

being vexed within their awne coūtrey, and peculiar dominion, should
make no rodes nor enterynges, into the Duchie of Normandy, the returnyng
whereof, was somewhat suspicious. This deuise for that season,
semed bothe profitable and necessary, wherefore, without long delaiyng
of tyme, he sente Robert Lorde Willoughby, with a greate crue
of souldiors, to inuade and destroye the countrey aboute Amias, and
Ihon lord Talbot, was appoynted to besiege the toune of Deape, and
he hymself, accompanied with Edmond duke of Somerset, set forward
into the Duchie of Aniow. The Lorde Willoughby, accordyng to his
commission, entered in the countrey to hym appoynted, and to thentent
that his commission should not be espied nor knowen, he straightly forbad
and inhibited, al maner fire, &amp; of burnyng of tounes, whiche is the
moste open and plain token of war and inuasion. By reason wherof, the
pore paysaūtes &amp; rustical people goyng abrode, without feare or suspicion
of euill, wer ouer ronne or taken with the horssemen, or thei could
attain to any toune, or forcelet: so that innumerable people wer slain, &amp;
taken, or thei heard any tydynges of their enemies approchyng. The
Frenchmen in the garrisōs adioynyng, astonnied at the clamor and cry
of the poore people, issued out in good ordre, and manfully set on their
enemies. The fight was sore, and the victory long doubtfull: But inconclusiō,
the Frenchmen seyng their people in the forefront of the battaill,
to be killed without mercie, like men desperate, turned their ba
                     •
                  
                  kes
and fearfully fled, the Englishmen folowed, and slewe many in the
chace, and suche as escaped the sweard, wer robbed and spoyled, by Lewes
Erle of sainct Paule, whiche was commyng to ayde the Englishe
nacion. In this conflicte were slain, aboue sixe .C. men of armes, and a
greater nombre taken: So the Lorde Willoughby, like a victorious
capitain, with riche spoyle and good prisoners, returned again to the
citee of Roan. The dukes of Yorke and Somerset, likewise entered into
the Duchie of Aniow, and Countie of Mayne, destroiyng tounes,
spoylyng y• people, and with great prey and profite, repaired again into
Normandy. The Duke of Somerset, not filled with this gain, entered
into the Marches of Britayne, and tooke by a fierce assaute, the
toune of Gerche, apperteinyng to the Duke of Alaunson, and spoyled
and brent thesame, and after that, departed to Ponzay, wher he soiourned
two monethes, frō whence he sent daily men of war, whiche destroyed
&amp; wasted the countreys of Aniow, Traonnoys &amp; Chatragonnoys.
               
                  THE Frenche kyng in all haste, sent the Marshall of Loyache, with
iiii.M. men, to resist the inuasions of the duke of Somerset, whiche capitain
determined to set on the duke and his people, in the dedde tyme
of the night. This enterprise was not so secret, but it was reueled to the
duke, whiche marched forward, and mette the Frenchemen halfe waie,
and after long fight, them by fine force manfully discomfited, and slew
a hundred persones and mo, and tooke captiues .lxii, whereof the chief
wer the lorde Dausigny, sir Lewes de Buell, and all the other almoste,

were Knightes and esquires. After this encountre, the Duke tooke the
toune of Beaumot Le Uicount, and manned all the fortresses, on the
Frontiers of his enemies, and with riche boties and wealthy captiues
came again to the Duke of Yorke.
               
                  DVRYNG these fortunate chaunces &amp; victories, the lord Talbot also,
the vnweried chieftain &amp; māly warrior, enuironed the toune of Deape,
with depe trenches and terrible mountaynes, and did set vp vpon the
mount de Poulet, a strong and defensible Bastile, at whiche tyme, was
capitain of thesame toune, Charles de Maretz, a man of more force in
battaill, then pollitique in defence of a siege: for the Englishemen beyng
a small nōbre, had to them deliuered with faire wordes, and fainte
strokes, the castle of Charlemesnyll, and diuerse other fortresses, adioynyng
to the toune. Duryng the siege, many encounters were had, and
many great assautes geuen, thenglishemen sometyme saued, and somtyme
gained, but the moste losse lighted on the Frenchemen for awhile.
But of iii. captaines sent furth at one tyme, (as you before haue heard)
all cannot returne with egall honor, and euen botie. For the lorde Talbot
perceiuyng the toune of Deape, to be strongly defended, both with
men, vitaile, and ordenaunce, and that he lacked all thesaid furnitures
for the accomplisshyng of his stoute enterprise, deliuered the custody of
the Bastile, with the gouernaunce of the 
                     •
                  iege, to his Bastarde sonne, a
valeaunt young man, and departed to Roan, for ayde, money, and municions.
The Frenche kyng, was quickely aduertised of the lord Talbots
absence, and of the estate of the Englishemen: wherefore without
delaye, he meanyng not to lose so great a prey, sent his eldest sonne Lewes
dolphyn of Uyen, accompan
                     •
                  ed with the Bastarde of Orleaunce,
called the erle of Dumoys, and diuerse other nobles of Fraunce, to the
nombre of .xv. thousande persones, well armed, and no lesse garnished
with all thynges necessary for their purpose. Three daies thei assayled
the Bastile, and so many tymes thei were put backe, but poulder failed
in the fortresse, and weapon wherwith to defend, was very scant, so that
in conclusion, the Englishmen wer vanqueshed, and the Bastile taken,
and in it, the Bastard Talbot, sir William Peytow, and sir Ihon Repeley,
whiche were shortely after redemed: The other Englishe souldiors
seyng the Bastile gayned, stoode all daie in good ordre of battaill,
and in the night, pollitiquely returned to Roan, without losse or damage.
At this assaute, the Frenchemen say, that thei slewe two hundred
Englishemen, and deny not, but thei lost fiue hundred persones, and by
this meanes, the one nacion loste the Bastile, and the other saued the
toune, to the greate displeasure of the Lorde Talbot: Whose presence
would asmuche auailed at this attempte, as his absence was losse and
detrement to his frendes, and felowes in war and chiualrie. But gain
is not alwaies perdurable, nor losse alwaies continuall.
               
                  VVHILE these thynges wer a doyng, Phillip Duke of Burgoyn,
hauyng an enuious hart, at the glory and fortunate successe of the Englishe

people, intending to bereue them of one of their assured frendes,
called Lewes of Luxenborough erle of sainct Poule, made sharpe war
vpon his countreis, and toke diuerse tounes, and fortresses from hym,
so that in conclusion more for feare, then for loue, he vtterly refused
his faithe and promise, made to the duke of Bedford his brother in law
and turned to the Frenche parte, and became a luke warme enemie to
the realme of England. The losse of this frend and necessary neighbor,
not alitle greued Kyng Henry and his counsaill: Howbeit, thei made
suche purueiaunce and prouision, by descrete counsail, that if he of euil
will, would do theim litle good, yet he of malice should doo to theim no
greate hurte or damage.
               
                  THE Englishe capitaines beyng in Guyen, hauyng knowledge of
the valeaūt doynges of their countreymen in the realme of Fraūce, determined
to do some notable and noble enterprise, on the French costes
adioynyng to Aquitayn: &amp; so, thei besieged the strong toune of Tartas
belongyng to the lorde Delabreth, their old and auncient enemie. The
capitaines and gouernors of the toune, consideryng their weakenesse,
and the force of the Englishemen, toke this appoyntment with the Englishe
capitaines, that the toune should remain neuter, and for the assuraunce
therof, thei deliuered Cadet the sonne of the lorde Delabreth
in pledge, vpon this condicion: that if the lorde Delabrethe, would not
assent to their agrement, then he should signifie his refusall, to the Englishe
capitaines, within three monethes next ensuyng: and he to haue
his pledge, and thei to do their beste. The Frenche kyng, at the request
of the lordes of Guyen, whiche wer not able to defende themselfes, toke
this matter in hand, and caused the lord Delabreth, to certifie his disagrement
to the Erle of Huntyngdon, lieuetenaunt for the kyng of Englande,
in the Duchie of Aquitayne. And to please the great Lordes of
Guyen, he assembled .lx.M. men, and came to Tholose, and so to Tartas:
to whom the chieftaines of the toune, seyng no succors commyng,
rendered the toune, and Cadet Delabrethe, whiche was lefte there as a
pledge, was deliuered. The French kyng after the yeldyng of Tartas,
remoued to sainct Seuere, a strong toune in Gascoyn, but smally peopled
with men of warre, whiche he toke by force, and slewe thre hundred
persones, and toke sir Thomas Rampstone prisoner. After this toune
gained, he with all his power besieged the citie of Arques, and toke the
Bulwarke of thesame, whiche was smally defended, and sone gotten.
The inhabitauntes of the toune, began sore to be afraied, and came to
the lorde Mountferrant, capitain for the kyng of England, requiryng
hym to haue mercie vpon them, and to rendre the toune to the Frenche
kyng, vpon some honest couenaunt or cōposicion. The capitain perceiuyng
the faint hartes of the Gascoyns, &amp; knowyng that without their
ayde, he was not able to resist the puyssaunce of the Frenche kyng, toke
an agrement and departed with all the Englishe crue to Burdeaux,
where he found the erle of Longuile, Capdaw of Bueffe, and sir Thomas

Rampstone, whiche was alitle before deliuered.
               
                  AFTER this, the fortresses of Ryoll and Mermandie, yelded them
to the Frenche kyng. Although these tounes thus submitted theim to
hym, yet he had them not long, nor made muche tariyng in the Duchie
of Guyen, for the Englishemen not onely prohibited the Gascoynes, to
minister to his armie, viandre and sustenaunce, but also gat into their
handes and toke suche vitailes, as wer conueyed to him, from Tholo
                     •
                  e
and Poytiers: So that in maner constrained with famyn and lacke of
prouision, he retired his army again into Fraunce. After whose departure,
the Englishe capitaines recouered again the citee of Acques, and
the other tounes by the French kyng gained, and toke prisoner his lieuetenaunt,

                  VVHILE the Frenche kyng was in Guyen, the lorde Talbot toke
the toune of Couchete, and after marched toward Gayllardon, whiche
was besieged by the Bastarde of Orleaunce Erle of Dumoys: whiche
Erle hearyng of the Englishmennes approchyng, reysed his siege and
saued hymself. Alitle before this enterprise, the Frenchemen had taken
the toune of Eureux, by treason of a fisher. Sir Fraunces Arragonoys
hearyng of that chaunce, apparreled sixe strong men, like rustical people
with sackes and baskettes, as carriers of corne and vitaile, and sent
them to the Castle of Cornyll, in the whiche diuerse Englishemen were
kept as prisoners: and he with an imbusshement of Englishemen, laye
in a valey nye to the fortresse. These sixe companions entered into the
Castle, vnsuspected and not mistrusted, and straight came to the chambre
of the capitain, &amp; laied handes vpō hym, geuyng knowledge therof
to their imbushement, whiche sodainly entered the Castle, and slew and
toke all the Frenchemen prisoners, and set at libertie all the Englishemen,
whiche thyng doen, thei set all the castle on fire, and departed with
great spoyle to the cit
                     •
                  e of Roan. Thus the lady victory, somtyme smiled
on the Englishe part, and sometyme on the Frenche side. Thus one
gayned this daie, and loste on the nexte. Thus Fortune chaunged, and
thus chaunce happened, accordyng to the old prouerbe, saiyng: in war
is nothyng certain, and victory is euer doubtfull.

Frenche nacion in the Region of Fraunce, and speake alitle
of a smoke that rose in England, whiche after grewe
to a greate fire, and a terrible flame, to the destruccion of
many a noble man. You haue heard before, how the Duke of Gloucester
sore grudged at the proude doynges of the Cardinall of Wynchester,
and howe the Cardinall likewise, sore enuied and disdayned at
the rule of the Duke of Gloucester, and how by the meanes of the duke

of Bedforde, their malice was appeaced, and eche was reconciled to other,
in perfite loue and amitie, to all mens outward iudgementes. After
whiche concord made, the Cardinall and the Archebishop of Yorke,
did many thynges without the consent of the kyng or the duke, beyng
(duryng the minoritie of the prince) gouernor &amp; protector of the realme,
wherwith the duke, (like a true harted prince) was neither contente nor
pleased: And so declared in writyng to the kyng, certain articles, wherin
the Cardinal and the Archebishop, had offended bothe the kyng and
his lawes, the true tenor, here after ensueth.

Duke of Gloucester, for my trouthe and acquitall, saied

your highnes, aduertisyng your excellēce, of suche thinges
in partie, as haue been doen in your tendre age, in derogacion of your
noble estate, &amp; hurt of both your realmes, &amp; yet be doen and vsed daily.
                  
                     FIRST the Cardinall, then beyng bishop of Winchester, toke vpō
                     
hym the state of Cardinall, whiche was nayed and denayed hym, by the
kyng of moste noble memory, my lorde your father, (whō God assoyle)
saiyng, yt he had as lefe set his croune beside hym, as to se hym weare a
Cardinal hat, he beyng a Cardinal: for he knewe full wel, the pride and
ambicion that was in his person, then beyng but a bishop, should haue
so greatly extolled hym into more intollerable pride, when that he were
a Cardinall: And also he though it against his fredome, of the chiefe
Churche of this realme, whiche, that he worshipped, as duely as euer
did prince, that blessed be his soule. And howbeit, that my saied Lorde
your father, (whom God assoyle), would haue agreed hym to haue had
certain clerkes of this land Cardinals, &amp; to haue no bishoprikes in Englande,
yet is intent was neuer to do so great derogacion to the Churche
of Cāterbury, to make them that wer his suffraganes, to set aboue
their Ordinary and Metropolitan, but the cause was that ingenerall,
and in all matters whiche might concerne the weale of hym, and of his
realme, he should haue proctors of his nacion, as other kynges Christen
had, in the courte of Rome, and not to abide in this lande, nor to be
in any parte of his counsailes, as been all the spirituall and temporall,
at parliamentes and other great counsailes, when you list to cal them:
and therfore, though it please you to do hym that worship, to set hym in
your priuie counsaill after your pleasure, yet in your parliament, wher
euery Lorde bothe spirituall and temporall, hath this place, he ought
to occupie but his place as a bishoppe.
                  
                     ITEM thesaied bishoppe, now beyng Cardinall, was assoyled of his 
bishopricke of Wynchester, wherupon he sued vnto our holy father, to
haue a bulle declaratory, notwithstandyng he was assūpt to the state of

Cardinal, that the sea was not voyde, where in deede it stode voyde by
a certain tyme, or thesaied bulle were graunted, and so he was exempte
from his ordinary, by the takyng on hym the state of Cardinal, and the
churche bishopricke of Winchester, so standyng voyde, he tooke again

into the cace of prouision) so that al his good was lawfully and clearly
forfeited, to you my right doubted Lorde, with more as the statute declareth
plainly for your aduauntage.

haue also estranged me your sole vncle, my cosyn of Yorke, my cosyn of
Huntyngdon, &amp; many other lordes of your kin, to haue any knowledge
of any greate matter, that might touche your high estate, or either of
your realmes. And of Lordes spirituall, of right, the Archebishoppe of
Cantorbury, should be your chief counsailer, the whiche is also estranged
and set a side. And so be many other right sad Lordes, and well aduised,
aswell spirituall as temporall, to the great hurt of you my right

accused of treason, for that she, by sorcery and enchaūtmēt, entended to
destroy the kyng, to thentent to aduaūce and promote her husbande to
the croune: vpon thys she was examined in sainct Stephens chappel,
before the Bisshop of Canterbury, and there by examinacion conuict &amp;
iudged, to do open penaunce, in .iij. open places, within the citie of Lō
                     don,
and after that adiudged to perpetuall prisone in the Isle of Man,
vnder the kepyng of sir Ihon Stāley, knyght. At the same season, wer
arrested as ayders and counsailers to the sayde Duchesse, Thomas
Southwel, prieste and chanon of saincte Stephens in Westmynster,
Ihon Hum priest, Roger Bolyngbroke, a conyng nycromancier, and
Margerie Iourdayne, surnamed the witche of Eye, to whose charge it
was laied, y• thei, at the request of the duchesse, had deuised an image of
waxe, representyng the kynge, whiche by their sorcery, a litle and litle cō
                     sumed,
entendyng therby in cōclusion to waist, and destroy the kynges
person, and so to bryng hym to death, for the which treison, thei wer adiudged
to dye, &amp; so Margery Iordayne was brent in smithfelde, &amp; Roger
Bolyngbroke was drawen &amp; quartered at tiborne, takyng vpō his
death, that there was neuer no suche thyng by theim ymagened, Ihon
Hum had his pardon, &amp; Southwel died in the toure before execucion:

of the Frēche kyng, doen in the duchie of Guyen,
wherefore, to for
                     •
                  ifie the countrey, least he peraduenture,
would attempt again alike 
                     •
                  orney, thei sent thether
sir William Wooduile, with .viii. hundred men,
to fortifie the frontiers, till a greater armie might be
assembled: And farther made publique proclamacion,
that all men whiche would transporte, or cary any corne, chese, or other
vitaile, into the parties of Acquitayn, should pay no maner of custome
or tallage, whiche lice
                     •
                  ce caused that countrey, to be well furnished of
all thynges necessarie and conuenient. About this season, the kyng remembryng
the valeaunt seruice, and noble actes of Ihon Lorde Talbot,
created hym Erle of Shrewesburie, and with a company of three
M. men, sente hym again into Normandy, for the better tuicion of the
same, whiche neither forgat his dutie, nor forslowed his businesse, but
daily labored &amp; hourely studied, how to molest &amp; damage his enemies.
               
                  IN this yere, died in Guyen the Countesse of Comyng, to whom the
Frenche Kyng, and also the Erle of Arminacke, pretended to be heire,
insomuche, that the Erle entered into al the landes of thesaied lady, as
very inheritor to her of right, and tooke homage of the people of the
countrey. But to haue a Rowland to resist an Oliuer: he sent solempne
Ambassadors to the kyng of Englande, offeryng hym his doughter in
mariage, not onely promisyng hym siluer hilles, and golden mountaines
with her, but also would be bound, to deliuer into the kyng of Englandes
handes, all suche Castles and tounes, as he or his auncestors
deteined from hym, within the whole duchie of Acquitayn or Guyen,
either by conquest of his progenitors, or by gyfte or deliuery of any
Frēche kyng: offryng farther, to aide thesame kyng with money, for the
recouery of other citees, within thesaied duchy, from him and his auncestors,
by the Frenche kynges progenitors, the lorde de Albrethe, and
other lordes of Gascoyn, iniustely kept and wrongfully withhoulden.
This offre semed bothe profitable, and honorable to kyng Henry and
his realme, and so the Ambassadors, wer bothe well heard, and louyngly
enterteined, and in conclusion, with a gentle aunswere (not without
great rewardes) thei departed into their countrey: after whom wer sent
for the conclusion of thesaied mariage into Guyen, sir Edward Hulle,
sir Robert Roos, and doctor Ihon Grafton deane of sainct Seuerines
with an honorable company, whiche (as all Englishe Cronographiers
affirme) bothe concluded the mariage, and by proxie aff
                     •
                  ed the young
Lady. The Frenche kyng was not ignoraunt, of all these conclusions,
wherfore disdainyng, that the Erle of Arminacke, should bothe vsurpe
against hym, the Countie of Comyng, and also ioyne hymself, with his
mortall enemie, the kyng of Englande, to recouer his right, and to punishe
his rebell, he sent Lewes his eldest sonne Dolphyn of Uyen, into

rouergne with a puissaunt army, whiche sodainly toke the Erle of Arminacke,
at the Isle in Iordayne, and his yongest sonne, and bothe his
doughters, and by force obteined the countreis of Arminacke, Lonuergne,
Rouergne and Moullesson, beside the citees of Seuerac and Cadenac,
and chased the Bastarde of Arminacke out of his countrey, and
cōstituted gouernor of all those seigniories, sir Theobald de Walpergne,
bailif of Lyon. So by reason of this infortunate chaūce, the mariage
concluded was differred, yea, and so long differred, that it neuer
toke effect, as you shall heare more plainly declared.

                  THus, while Englande was vnquieted, and Fraunce sore
vexed, by spoyle, slaughter, and burnyng, all christendom
lamented the continuall destruccion of so noble a realme,
and the effusion of so muche Christen bloud, wherfore, to
appeace the mortall warre, so long contineuyng betwene
these twoo puyssaunt kynges, all the princes of Christendom, so muche
labored and trauailed, by their orators and Ambassadors, that the frostie
hartes of bothe the parties, wer somewhat mollified, and their indurate
stomackes, greatly asswaged. So there was a greate diete appoynted,
to be kepte at the citee of Tours in Tourayne, where, for the
kyng of Englande appered, William de la Pole erle of Suffolke, doctor
Adame Molyns, keper of the kynges priuie seale, and Robert lorde
Roos, and diuerse other: And for the Frenche Kyng were appoynted,
Charles Duke of Orleaūce, Lewes de Burbon erle of Uandos
                     ••
                  e, and
greate Master of the Frenche kynges housholde, sir Piers de Bresell
Stewarde of Poytou, and Bartram Beauriau, Lorde of Precignye.
There were also sente thither, Ambassadors from the Empire, from
Spayne, from Denmarke, and frō Hungary, to be mediators betwene
these twoo princes. The assemble was greate, but the coste was muche
greater, in somuche that euery parte, for the honor of their Prince, and
praise of their countrey, set furth themselfes, aswell in fare, as apparel,
to the vttermoste poynt and highest prike. Many metynges wer had, &amp;
many thynges moued to come to a finall peace, and mutuall concord.
But inconclusion, for many doubtes and greate ambiguities, whiche
rose on bothe parties, a finall concord could not be agreed, but in hope
to come to a peace, a certain truce aswell by sea as by land, was concluded
by the cōmissioners, for .xviij. monethes, whiche afterward, againe
was prolonged, to the yere of our Lorde .M.iiii.C.xlix. if in the meane
season it had not been violated &amp; broken, as here after shalbe declared.
               
                  IN the treatyng of this truce, the Erle of Suffolke, extendyng his
cōmission to the vttermoste, without assent of his associates, imagened
in his phantasie, that the nexte waie to come to a perfite peace, was to
moue some mariage, betwene the Frenche kynges kynsewoman, and
kyng Henry his souereigne: &amp; because the Frenche kyng had no doughter

of ripe age, to be coupled in matrimony with the kyng his Master,
he desired to haue the Lady Margaret, cosyn to the Frenche kyng,
and doughter to Reyner duke of Aniow, callyng hymself kyng of Scicile,
Naples, and Hierusalem, hauyng onely the name and stile of the
same, without any peny profite, or fote of possessiō. This mariage was
made straunge to therle a good space, in somuche that he repented hym
of the first mociō, but yet like a bold man, entendyng not to take afoile
in so greate a matter, desisted not still, daily to sollicite and aduaunce
forward his cause. The wily Frenchemen, perceiuyng the ardent affeccion
of the erle, toward the conclusion of mariage, declared to hym that
this mariage, was not like to come to conclusion, as he desired, because
the kyng his Master, occupied a greate parte of the Duchie of Aniow,
and the citee of Mauns, and the whole Countey of Mayne, apperteynyng
(as thei saied) to kyng Reyner, father to the damosell.
               
                  THE erle of Suffolke (I cannot saie) either corrupted with bribes,
or to muche affeccionate to this vnprofitable mariage, condiscended
and agreed to their mocion, that the Duchie of Aniow, and the countie
of Mayne, should be released and deliuered, to the kyng her father, demaundyng
for her mariage, neither peny nor farthyng: (as who would
saie) that this newe affinitie, excelled riches, and surmounted gold and
precious stone. And to thentent that of this truce, might ensue a finall
concorde, a daie of enteruie
                     •
                  e or metyng was appoynted, betwene the
two kynges, in a place cōuenient, betwene Charters and Roan. When
these thynges wer concluded, the Erle of Suffolke with his company,
thinkyng to haue brought ioyfull tidynges, to the whole realme of Englande,
departed from Toures, and so by long iorneis, arriued at Douer,
and came to the kyng to Westminster, and there openly before the
kyng and his counsail, declared how he had taken an honorable truce,
for the sauegard of Normandy, &amp; the wealth of y• realme, out of whiche
truce, he thought, yea, and doubted not, but a perpetual peace, and a finall
concorde, should shortely proceade and growe out. And muche the
soner, for that honorable mariage, that inuincible alliaunce, that Godly
affinitie, whiche he had concluded: omittyng nothyng, whiche might
extoll &amp; setfurth, the personage of the Ladie, nor forgettyng any thyng,
of the nobilitie of her kinne, nor of her fathers high stile: as who would
saie, that she was of suche an excellent beautie, and of so high a parentage,
that almoste no king or Emperor, was worthy to be her make. Although
this mariage, pleased well the Kyng, and diuerse of his counsaill,
and especially suche as wer adherentes, and fautors to the erle of
Suffolke, yet Humfrey Duke of Gloucester, Protector of the realme,
repugned and resisted as muche as in hym laie, this new alliaunce and
contriued matrimonie: alledgyng that it was neither consonaunt to
the lawe of GOD nor man, nor honorable to a prince, to infrynge and
breake a promise or contracte, by hym made and concluded, for the vtilitie
and profite of his realme and people, declaryng, that the kyng, by

his Ambassadors, sufficiently instructed and authorised, had cōcluded
and cōtracted, a mariage betwene his highnes, &amp; the doughter of therle
of Arminacke, vpon condicions, bothe to hym and his realme, asmuche
profitable as honorable. Whiche offers and cōdicions, thesaid erle sith
his commyng out of his captiuitie and thraldome, is redy to yelde and
performe, saiyng: that it was more conueniente for a Prince, to marie a
wife with riches and frendes, then to take a make with nothyng, and
disherite hymself and his realme of olde rightes and auncient seigniories.
The duke was not heard, but the Erles doynges, were condiscended
vnto, and allowed. Whiche facte engendered suche a flame, that is
neuer wente out, till bothe the parties with many other wer consumed
and slain, to the great vnquietnes of the kyng and his realme. And for
the performaunce of these conclusions, the Frenche Kyng sent the Erle
of Uandos
                     •
                  e, greate Master of his hous, &amp; the Archebishop of Reyns,
first pere of Fraunce, and diuerse other into England, whiche wer ioyously
receiued, and frendly entertayned. Which Ambassadors, after instrumentes
on bothe parties, sealed and deliuered, (not vnteward
                     •
                  d)
returned into their countrey. When these thynges were thus doen, the
kyng, bothe for the honor of his realme, and to assure to hymself, more
speciall frendes, he created Lorde Ihon Holand Erle of Huntyngdon,
Duke of Excester, as his father was, and Humfrey Erle of Stafford,
was made duke of Buckyngham, and Henry Erle of Warwicke, was
erected to the title of Duke of Warwicke, and the Erle of Suffolke,
made Marques of Suffolke, whiche Marques with his wife, &amp; many
honorable personages of men and women, richely adorned, bothe with
apparell and Iuels, hauyng with them many costly chariottes, &amp; gorgious
horselitters, sailed into Fraunce, for the conueyaunce of the nominated
Quene, into the realme of England. For kyng Reyner her father,
for al his long stile, had to short a purse, to send
                     •
                   his doughter honorably,
to the kyng her spouse.
            
            
               ¶The .xxiii. yereThe .xxiii. yere.
               
               
                  THIS noble company, came to the citee of Toures in
Tourayne, where thei were honorably receiued, bothe
of the Frēch kyng, and of the kyng of Scicile. Wher
the Marques of Suffolke, as procurator to Kyng
Henry, espoused thesaid Ladie, in the churche of sainct
Martyns. At whiche mariage were present, the father
and mother of the bride, the Frenche kyng hymself,
whiche was vncle to the husbande, and the Frenche quene also, whiche
was awnte to the wife. There wer also, the dukes of Orleaunce, of Calaber,
of Alaunson, and of Britayn, vii. Erles, xii. Barons .xx. Bishoppes,
beside kinghtes and gentlemen. There wer triumphaunt Iustes,
costly feastes, and delicate banquettes, but all pleasure hath an ende,
and euery ioye is not continuall. So that after these high solempnities

finished, and these honorable ceremonies ended, the Marques had the
Ladie Margaret to hym deliuered, whiche in greate estate, he cōueyed
through Normandy to Deape, and so transported her into Englande,
where she landed at Portesmouthe, in the mone
                     •
                  he of Aprill. This woman
excelled all other, aswell in beautie and fauor, as in wit and pollicie,
and was of stomack and corage, more like to a man, then a woman.
Sone after her arriuall, she was conueyed to the toune of Southwike
in Hamshire, where she, with all nupciall Ceremonies, was coupled in
matrimony, to kyng Henry the vi. of that name. After whiche mariage,
she was with greate triumphe, conueyed to London, and so to Westminster,
where, vpō the .xxx. daie of May, she, with al solempnitie thervnto
apperteinyng, was Crouned Quene of this noble realme of Englande.
Who so would knowe, the costly receipt, the pleasaunt companie,
the gorgeous apparell, the diuersitie of Instrumentes, the straūge
pagiauntes, the behauior of the Lordes, the beautie of the Ladies, the
sumptuous feast, the delicate viander, the marcial iustes, the fierce turnais,
the lustie daunces, &amp; the miniō sōges, which wer shewed, setfurth
and practised at her coronacion, let hym loke in the Chronicles of London,
&amp; of Robert Fabian, and there he shal finde thē set furth at the ful.
               
                  THIS mariage semed to many, bothe infortunate, and vnprofitable
to the realme of England, and that for many causes. First the kyng
with her had not one peny, and for the fetchyng of her, the Marques of
Suffolke, demaunded a whole fiftene, in open parliament: also for her
mariage, the Duchie of Aniow, the citee of Mauns, and the whole coū
                  tie
of Mayne, were deliuered and released to Kyng Reyner her father,
whiche countreis wer the very stayes, and backestandes to the Duchy
of Normandy. Furthermore for this mariage, the Erle of Arminacke,
toke suche great displeasure, that he became vtter enemy to the realme
of Englande, and was the chief cause, that the Englishmen, wer expulsed
out of the whole duchie of Acquitayne, and lost bothe the countreis
of Gascoyn and Guyen. But moste of all it should seme, that God with
this matrimony was not content. For after this spousage, the Kynges
frendes fell from hym, bothe in Englande and in Fraunce, the Lordes
of his realme, fell in diuision emongest themselfes, the commons rebelled
against their souereigne Lorde, and naturall Prince, feldes were
foughten, many thousandes slain, and finally, the kyng deposed, and
his sonne slain, and this Quene sent home again, with asmuche misery
and sorowe, as she was receiued with pompe and triumphe, suche is
worldly vnstablenes, and so waueryng is false flatteryng fortune.
               
                  DVRYNG the tyme of this truce, Richard Duke of Yorke, and diuerse
other capitaines, repaired into England, bothe to visite their wifes,
children, and Frendes, and also to consulte, what should be doen, if
the truce ended.

                  FOR the whiche cause,The .xxiiii. yere. the Kyng called his high court of Parliament,
in the whiche aboue all thynges, it was concluded,
diligently to forsee, that Normandy should be well furnished
and strongly defended, before the terme of the truce should be
expired: for it was openly knowen, that the French kyng, was ready in
all thynges, to make open warre, if no peace or abstinence of warre, wer
agreed or concluded. For whiche consideracion, money was graunted,
men wer appoynted, and a great armie gathered together, and the duke
of Somerset, was appoynted Regent of Normandy, and the Duke of
Yorke thereof discharged. In whiche Parliament, to please the people
with al, it was enacted, yt whē whete was sold for .vi.s.viii. d. the quartr
and Rye for .iiii.s. and Barly for .iii.s. it should be lawfull to euery mā
to cary thesaid kyndes of corne▪ into the parties beyond the sea, without
licence, so it wer not to the kynges enemies or rebelles: whiche act, kyng
Edward the .iiii. for the vtilitie of his people, approued and confirmed.

and in no lesse grace with quene Margaret, for cōcludyng the mariage
betwene theim twoo, somewhat infected with the sede of vainglory, and
thinkyng that his procedynges and dooynges in Fraunce, (duryng the
tyme of his legacion) had aswell pleased all men, as thei pleased hymself,

the Realmes of Englande and of Fraunce, as in the makyng of
the mariage betwene the kyng his souereigne lorde and theirs, and the
noble Princes lady Margarete, daughter to the Kyng of Scicile and
Hierusalem: Openyng also to them, that thesaid truce should expire the
first daie of April next commyng, except a finall peace or a farther truce
wer concluded in the meane season: aduisyng them to prouide and fors

all thynges necessarie, for the warre (as though no concorde should succede,
nor agrement could take place) least the Frenchemen perceiuyng
theim vnprouided, would take their aduauntage, and agree neither to
reason nor amitie: saiyng vnto theim, that sithe he had admonished the
kyng, and them, accordyng to his duetie and allegeaunce, if any thyng
quailed, or if daunger ensued, he was thereof innocent and gilteles, and
had acquited hymself like a louyng subiecte, and a faithfull counsailor,
praiyng the lordes to haue it in their remembraunce. Likewise the morowe
after, he with certain lordes, discended into the cōmon house, where
he declared again all thesaied matters, to the Knightes, Citezens and
Burgesses, omittyng nothyng, that might sounde to his glory, nor openyng
any thing, whiche might redound to his dispraise: praiyng the cō
                  mons
for his discharge, that aswell all his doynges and procedynges
in the kynges affaires beyond the sea, as also his aduertisement &amp; counsaill,

opened to the lordes and commons now together assembled, might
be, by the Kyng and theim, enacted and enrolled in the Recordes of the

the commons and all the company of the nether house, repaired to the
kinges presence, sittyng in his trone, emongest his lordes in the parliament

regestered. At whiche humble intercession, the lordes, aswell spirituall
as temporal, rose from their seates, and on their knees, made to the
kyng like request and peticion, as thei of the commons before wer desired:
wherupon, the kyng by the mouthe of the Archebishop of Canterbury
his Chancellor, made answere, that their requestes wer so reasonable
and so honorable, that he in no wise could, but louyngly accept and
gently alowe thesame, saiyng also: that their desires, wer to him a singuler
pleasure, and an especiall comforte, and that he would from thencefurthe
accepte and take thesaied Marques to his benigne grace, and
especiall fauoure, as a persone, whiche had dooen bothe true, faithefull,
and notable seruice to hym and to his Realme, to the intent, that al men
put in like trust, should enforce theim selfes, to doo like or better seruice
to their souereigne Lorde or Master: agreyng also (accordyng to their
requestes and peticions) that the labors, demeanors, diligences, and
declaracions of thesaied Marques of Suffolke, and thesaied commendacions
and desires, not only of the lordes, but also of the commons, aswel
for the honor of hym and his posteritie, as for his acquital and discharge,
should be enacted, and enrolled in the Recordes of thesame parliament,
whiche was so doen. This Marques thus gotten vp, into fortunes
trone, not content with his degree, by the meanes of the Quene,

was shortely erected to the estate and degree of a Duke, and ruled the
Kyng at his pleasure, in so muche, he obteined the wardshippes, bothe
of body and landes of the Coūtesse of Warwicke, and of the lady Margarete,
sole heire to Ihon Duke of Somerset (whiche lady was after,
mother to Kyng Henry the seuenth) and beside that, caused the Kyng to
create Ihon de Foys, sonne to Gaston de Foys, erle of Longuile, and
Capdaw of Bueffez, erle of Kendale: whiche Ihō had maried his niece,
and by his procurement, the kyng elected into the order of the Garter,
thesaid Gaston, and Ihon his sonne, geuyng to the sonne, towardes the
maintenaunce of his degree and estate, landes and Castles, in the Duchie
of Guyen, amountyng to the some of one thousand poundes by the

                  HERE a man maie beholde, what securitie is in worldly, glory, and
what constancie is in fortunes smilyng: for this Duke of Suffolke, in
open Parliament of the Lordes praised, of the commons thanked, and
into the kynges fauor, entierly receiued, within foure yeres after, was
in thesame place, by the commons of the Realme, accused of many treasons,
mispricions and offences, doen and committed against the Kyng,
and the common wealthe of his Realme, and in conclusion, beyng exiled
the realme, he was taken vpon the sea, and made shorter by the hedde,
whiche chaunce had not happened to hym, if he had remembred the
counsail of the popyngay, saiyng: when thou thynkest thy self in courte
moste surest, then is it high tyme to get thee home to rest.
               
                  THESE thynges beyng in doyng, the Frenche kyng seyng, that the
toune of Mauns, and diuerse fortresses in Mayne, were not to hym deliuered,
accordyng to the appoyntment made, gathered together a great
numbre of people, for to recouer thesame: wherof the kyng of England
beyng aduertised, (least the breache of truce should begynne by hym)
caused the toune to be deliuered, without any force.
               
                  THIS yere, an Armerars suruaunt of London, appeled his master of
treason, whiche offered to bee tried by battaill. At the daie assigned, the
frendes of the master, brought hym Malmesey and Aqua vite, to comforte
hym with all, but it was the cause of his and their discomforte: for
he poured in so muche, that when he came into the place in Smithfelde,
where he should fight, bothe his witte and strength failed hym: and so
he beyng a tall and a hardye personage, ouerladed with hote drynkes,
was vanqueshed of his seruaunte, beyng but a cowarde and a wretche,
whose body was drawen to Tiborne, &amp; there hanged and behedded. In
whiche yere was a greate insurreccion in Norwiche, against the Prior
of the place, in so muche that the citezens kepte the gates, against the
Duke of Norffolke, whiche came thither to appea
                     •
                  e the matter: but in
conclusion, thei opened the gates, and submitted theimselfes. The chief
offenders, wer (accordyng to their desertes) straightly punished, and executed,
and the Maire was discharged of his office, and sir Ihon Clifton

was made gouernoure there, till the kyng had restored the citezens
to their auncient liberties, and francheses. This commocion, was for
certain newe exaccions, whiche the Prior claimed and toke of the citezens,
contrary to their auncient fredomes and vsages: but this was not
the dewe meane to come to their right and purpose, and therefore because
thei erred and wente out of the pathe, thei were by punishemente
brought again to a very straight trade and the right waie.

                  DUryng the tyme of this truce or abstinence of warre,
while there was nothyng to vexe or trouble the myndes
of men, within the realme, a sodain mischief, and a
long discorde, sprang out sodainly, by the meanes of a
woman: for kyng Henry, whiche reigned at this tyme
was a man of a meke spirite, and of a symple witte,
preferryng peace before warre, reste before businesse,
honestie before profite, and quietnesse before laboure. And to the intent
that all men might perceiue, that there could be none, more chaste, more
meke, more holy, nor a better creature: In hym reigned shamefastnesse,
modestie, integritie, and pacience to bee marueiled at, takyng and sufferyng
all losses, chaunces▪ displeasures, and suche worldely tormentes,
in good parte▪ and with a 
                     •
                  acient maner, as though thei had chaunced
by his awne fault, or negligent ouersight: yet he was gouerned of them
whom he should haue ruled, and brideled of suche, whom he sharpely
should haue spurred: He gaped not for honor, nor thristed for riches,
but studied onely for the health of his soule: the sauyng wherof, he estemed
to bee the greate

                   wisedome, and the losse thereof, the extremest folie
that could 
                     〈◊〉
                   But on the other parte, the Quene his wife, was a
woman of a greate witte, and yet of no greater witte, then of haute stomacke,
desirous of glory, and couetous of honor, and of reason, pollicye
counsaill, and other giftes and talentes of nature, belongyng to a man,
full and flowyng: of witte and wilinesse she lacked nothyng, nor of diligence,
studie, and businesse, she was not vnexperte: but yet she had one
poynt of a very woman: for often tyme, when she was vehemēt and fully
bente in a matter, she was sodainly like a wethercocke, mutable, and
turnyng. This woman perceiuyng that her husbande did not frankely
rule as he would, but did all thyng by thaduise and counsaill of Hū
                  frey
duke of Gloucester, and that he passed not muche on the aucthority
and gouernaunce of the realme, determined with her self, to take vpon
her the rule and regiment, bothe of the kyng and his kyngdome, &amp; to depriue
&amp; euict out of al rule and aucthoritie, thesaid duke, then called the
lord protector of the realme: least men shoud saie &amp; report, yt she had neither
wit nor stomacke, whiche would permit &amp; suffre her husband, beyng
of perfect age &amp; mās estate, like a yong scholer or innocent pupille, to be

gouerned by the disposicion of another man. This manly woman, this
coragious quene, ceased not to prosecute furthwith, her inuented imaginacion
and prepēsed purpose, but practised daily the furtheraunce of
thesame. And although this inuēciō came first of her awne high mynd▪
and ambicious corage, yet it was furthered and set forward by suche, as
of long tyme had borne malice to the duke, for declaryng their vntruth
as you before haue heard. Whiche venemous serpentes, and malicious
Tygers, perswaded, incensed and exhorted the quene, to loke well vpon
the expenses and reuenues of the realme, and thereof to call an accompt:
affirmyng plainly that she should euidently perceiue, that the Duke of
Gloucester, had not so muche aduaunced &amp; preferred the commō wealth
and publique vtilitie, as his awne priuate thinges &amp; peculiar estate. Beside
this, Reyner kyng of Scicile, wrote to his doughter, that she &amp; her
husband, should take vpon them, the rule &amp; gouernaunce of the realme,
and not to be kept vnder, like yong wardes and desolate orphanes. The
quene perswaded and encoraged by these meanes, toke vpō her and her
husbande, ye high power and aucthoritie ouer the people and subiectes.
And although she ioyned her husbande with hir in name, for a countenaunce,
yet she did all, she saied all, and she bare the whole swynge, as
the strong oxe doth, whē he is yoked in the plough with a pore silly asse:
and firste of all she excluded the duke of Gloucester, from all rule and
gouernaunce, not prohibityng suche as she knewe to be his mortal enemies,
to inuent and imagyne, causes and griefes, against hym and his:
so that by her permissiō, and fauor, diuerse noble men conspired against
hym, of the whiche, diuerse writers affirme, the Marques of Suffolke,
and the duke of Buckyngham to bee the chiefe, not vnprocured by the
Cardinall of Winchester, and the Archebishop of Yorke. Diuerse articles,
bothe heynous and odious, were laied to his charge in open counsaill,
and in especiall one, that he had caused men adiudged to dye, to be
put to other execucion, then the law of the land had ordered or assigned:
for surely the duke beyng very well learned in the lawe 
                     •
                  iuill, detestyng
malefactors, and punishyng their offences, gat great malice and hatred
of suche, as feared to haue condigne reward for their vngracious actes
and mischeuous doynges. Although the duke (not without great laude
and praise) sufficiently answered to all thynges to hym obiected, yet because
his death was determined, his wisedom litle helped, nor his truth
smally auailed: but of this vnquietnes of mynde, he deliuered hymself,
because he thought neither of death, nor of condempnacion to dye: suche
affiaunce had he in his strong truthe, and suche confidence had he in indifferent
iustice. But his capitall enemies and mortal foes, fearyng that
some tumulte or commocion might arise, if a prince so well beloued of
the people, should bee openly executed, and put to death, determined to
trappe and vndoo hym, or he thereof should haue knowledge or warnyng.
So for the furtheraūce of their purpose, a parliament was somoned
to be kept at Bery, whether resorted all the peres of the realme, and

                  
                     •
                  mongest them, the duke of Gloucester, whiche on the second daie of the
session, was by the lorde Beamond, then high Constable of Englande,
accompanied with the duke of Buckynghā, and other, arrested, apprehended,
and put in warde, and all his seruauntes sequestered from hym,
and .xxxii. o
                     •
                   the chief of his retinue, were sent to diuerse prisons, to the
greate admiracion of the common people. The duke the night after his
emprisonement, was found dedde in his bed, and his body shewed to the
lordes and commons, as though he had died of a palsey or empostome:
but all indifferent persons well knewe, that he died of no natural death,
but of some violēt force: some iudged hym to be strangled: some affirme,
that a hote spitte was put in at his foundement: other write, that he was
stiffeled or smoldered betwene twoo fetherbeddes. After whose deathe,
none of his seruauntes (although thei wer arraigned and attainted) wer
put to death: for the Marques of Suffolk, when thei should haue been
executed, shewed openly their pardon, but this doyng appeased not the
grudge of the people, whiche saied that the pardone of the seruauntes,
was no amendes for murderyng of their master. The dedde corse of this
duke, was caried to sainct Albons, and there honorably buried. Thus
was this noble prince, sonne, brother, and vncle to kynges, whiche had
valeauntly and pollitiquely by the space of .xxv. yeres gouerned this
Realme, and for his demerites, called the good duke of Gloucester, by
a bone caste by his enemies, choked and brought to his fatall fine, and
last ende. So al men maie openly se, that to men in aucthorit
                     •
                  e, no place
no not the courte the cheif refuge of all, nor the dwellyng house, nor yet
a mannes priuate Castle, or his bed ordeined for his quietnes, is out of
daunger of deathes dart. It semeth to many men▪ that the name and title
of Gloucester, hath been vnfortunate and vnluckie to diuerse, whiche
for their honor, haue been erected by creacion of princes, to that si
                     •
                  le and
dignitie, as Hugh Spenser, Thomas of Woodstocke, sonne to kyng
Edward the third, and this duke Humfrey, whiche thre persons, by miserable
death 
                     •
                  inished their daies, and after them kyng Richard the .iij.
also▪ duke of Gloucester, in ciuill warre was slain and confounded: so y•
this name of Gloucester, is takē for an vnhappie and vnfortunate stile,
as the prouerbe speaketh of Seianes horse, whose rider was euer vnhorsed,
and whose possessor was euer brought to miserie. When the rumor
of the dukes death, was blowen through the realme, many mē wer
sodainly appalled and amased for feare: many abhorred and detested y•
faict, but all men reputed it an abhominable crueltie, and a shameful tiranny.
But the publique wealth of the realme of Englande, by the vnworthy
death of this pollitique prince, susteined greate losse, &amp; ran into
ruyne, for surely the whole waight and burden of the realme, rested and
depēded vpō him, as the experience afterward did declare. For after his
death▪ good &amp; sage men fearyng thē selfes, fled out of y• flatteryng court,
into whose places entered suche, as desiryng their awne promocion, set
open the gates to new faccions, whiche could neuer be extinct, til all the

seignories beyōd the sea (except Caleice &amp; the marches) were lost, &amp; kyng
Hēry in conclusion spoyled of hys Realme &amp; lyfe. There is an olde sayd
saw, that a man entēding to auoide the smoke, falleth into the fyre: So
here, the Quene mynding to preserue her husbād in honor, &amp; her selfe in
aucthoritie, procured &amp; consentid to the death of this noble man, whose
onely death brought to passe that thynge, which she woulde most fayne
haue eschewed, and toke from her that iewel, whiche she moste desired:
for if this Duke had lyued, the Duke of Yorke durst not haue made title
to the crowne: if this Duke had liuyd, the nobles had not conspired
against the King, nor yet the cōmōs had not rebelled: if this Duke had
lyued, the house of Lācaster had not been defaced and destroyed, which
thynges hapned all contrary by the destrucciō of this good man. This
is the worldly iudgemēt, but God knoweth, what he had predestinate, &amp;
what he had ordeined before, againste whose ordinaunce preuayleth no
counsaill, and against whose will auayleth no stryuinge.

first yere of the rule of the Quene, I fynde no thyng done,
worthye to be rehersed, within the Realme of Englande,
but that the marques of Suffolke by greate fauor of the
Kynge, and more desire of the Quene, was erected to the
title, and name of the duke of Suffolke, whiche dignitie he shorte tyme
enioied &amp; which degre, he but a briefe seasō possessed. For after the deposicion
or rather the destruccion of the good duke of Gloucester, and the
exaltacion and aduauncement of this glorious man: Rychard duke of
Yorke, beyng greatly alied by his wyfe, to the chefe peres and potentates
of the Realme, ouer and besyde hys awne progenye and greate consanguinitie,
perceyuing the Kyng to be a ruler not Ruling, &amp; the whole
burden of the Realme, to depend in the ordinaūces of the Quene &amp; the
duke of Suffolke, began secretly to allure to hys frendes of the nobilitie,
and priuatly declared to thē, hys title and right to the Crowne, and
lykewyse dyd he to certain wyse and saige Gouernors and Rulers of
dyuers cities and townes: which priuie attēpt was so politiquely handeled
and so secretly kept, that hys prouisiō was ready, before his purpose
was openly published, and hys frendes opened theim selfes or the
contrary parte coulde them espye: but in conclusion tyme reueled truth
and olde hyd hatred openly sprange out, as you shall hereafter bothe
lament and heare.
               
                  DVRING these doynges, Henry Beaufford, bishop of Winchester,
and called the ryche Cardinall, departed out of this world, and
was buryed at Wynchester. This man was sonne to Ihon of Gaunte
duke of Lancaster, discēded of an honorable lignage, but borne in Baste,
more noble of blodd, then notable in learning, haut in stomacke, and
hygh in coūtenaunce, ryche aboue measure of all men, &amp; to fewe liberal,

disdaynfull to hys kynne and dreadfull to his louers▪ preferrynge money
before frendshippe, many thinges beginning, and nothing perfourmyng.
Hys couetous insaciable, and hope of long lyfe, made hym both
to forget God, hys Prynce and hym selfe, in hys latter daies: for doctor
Ihon Baker hys pryuie counsailler, and his chappelleyn, wrote, that he
lyeng on his death bed, sayd these wordes. Why should I dye, hauīg so
muche ryches, if the whole Realme wolde saue my lyfe, I am able either
by pollicie to get it, or by ryches to bye it. Fye, will not death be hyered,
nor will money do nothyng? when my nephew of Bedford died, I thought
my selfe halfe vp the whele, but when I sawe myne other nephew of
Gloucester disceased, then I thought my self able to be equale with kinges,
and so thought to encrease my treasure in hoope to haue worne a
tryple Croune. But I se now the worlde faileth me, and so I am deceyued:
praiyng you all to pray for me. Of the gettyng of this mannes
goodes, both by power, legantye or spiritual bryberie I wil not speake:
but the kepinge of them for his ambycious purpose, aspiryng to ascend
to the papisticall sea, was bothe great losse to his naturall Prince, and
natyue countrey: for his hiddē ryches might haue wel holpen the King,
and his secrete treasure migth haue releued the cōmonaltie, whē money
was scante and importunate charges, were dayly imminent. After the
death of this prelate, which was a great stay to the Kyng &amp; the realme,
the affayres in Fraunce, were neither well loked to, nor the gouernours
of the countrey were well aduised. For an Englishe capitayn, called syr
Franceys Surrien the Arragonoys, a man for his witt and actiuitie
admitted to the ordre of the Gartier, toke by scalynge sodaynly in the
night, a Towne on the frontiers of Normandie, belonging to the duke
of Britayn, called Fongiers, spoyling the same, and kyllinge the inhabitaūtes
to the great distruccion of the people, and more displeasure to
the duke of Britayn, their souereigne lorde. The Duke beynge thereof
aduertysed, sent woorde to the Frenche kynge, declaringe to him that in
the time of truce (in the which, he as his allye and vassal was cōprehendyd)
he was spoyled and bereuyd of his towne of Fongiers: besechyng
the Frenche kynge, in that cause to se a recompense and amendemente:
whereupon he sent Ihon Hauart his caruar, &amp; Ihon Cosynet one of the
masters of his requestes to the kyng of England: &amp; to the duke of Somerset,
he dispatched Peter de Fountaynes Esquyer, &amp; one of the cheife
of his stable, to whome by both the Princes, it was aunswered, that the
facte and enterprise was bothe done contrary to there mynde, will and
knowledge. And for the truce to be kept, and not onely restitucion, but
also amendes to be made to the Duke of Britayn, a daye of dyet and
assemble was appoynted to be kept at the town of Louiers. At the time
appointed bothe the parties assembled: the Frenche parte demaunded
amendes, with no litle recompense: The Englishe orators aunswered,
that without offēce, no thing by iustice, ought to be satisfied: affirming
the doynge of syr Francyes Surrien, to be his onely acte, withoute the

consent or counsail, either of the kynge of England, or the duke of Somerset
his lieuetenāt and regent. Duringe this dayly communicaciō &amp;
longe delaye, certain Frenchemen, frendes to the duke of Britayn, desyring
to be reuenged of the iniurie done to him at Fongiers, and also
imagening, how to do some new displeasure to the Englishmē, were aduertised
by a wagoner of Louiers, yt the town of Poūtelarche, was but
meanly manned and slenderly furnished, and the watche was but negligently
loked to: with whiche saiynges the Frenchemen beynge somwhat
encouraged, deuised a waye, howe by pollicie to take the towne:
So the wagoner laded his wagon, and passed forward, hauinge in his
company .i
                     •
                  . stronge varlettes clad lyke carpenters, with greate axes in
their neckes. And for the furtherāce of their purpose, the lord of Bressy,
with a chosen company of men of armes, lodged him selfe in a busshement
nere to the gate of sainct Andrewe. And capitayn Floquet, accompanied
with syr Iames of Cleremoūt, and another great company, priuilie
lurked vnder a wood toward Louiers. When al thinges were appoynted,
early in the morning in the beginning of the moneth of October,
the wagoner came to the gate, &amp; called the porter by name, praiyng
him to open the gate, that he mighte passe to Roen, and returne agayne
the same night. The porter (whiche wel knew the voice of his customer)
toke litle hede to the other .ij. cōpaignions, &amp; so opened the on
                     •
                   gate, and
sent another felow of his, to opē the 
                     •
                  ormost gate. Whē ye Chariotte was
on the draw bridge, betwene both ye gates, the Chariottemaster gaue the
porter money, and for the nones, let one pece fal to the grounde, &amp; whyle
the porter stoped to take it vp, the wagoner with his dagger stroke him
in at his throte, so that he cried for no healpe, and the .ij. greate lubbers
slewe the other porters, and with their axes cutte the aexletre of the wagone,
so that the drawe bridge could not be shortlye drawen vp. Which
thinges done, they made a signe to capitayne Floquet, whiche, without
delay or tract of time, entered the town, and 
                     •
                  lew and toke the Englishmen,
which neither heard nor thought of any suche enterprise: emongest
whom, the lord Fauconbridge, capitaine of the saide towne, was apprehended
as a prisoner. By this praty cautele and 
                     •
                  lyghte imposture, was
the towne of Poūtelarche takē and surprised, which towne was the kay
and passage ouer the ryuer of Soame, frō Fraūce to Normandy, beyng
distant frō Roen, onely .iiii. leages. Thus wrong was added to wrong,
&amp; iniurie heped to iniurie, wherby y• terme of truce was violated, &amp; mortal
warre was reuiued. But because y• taking of this fortresse, had a certain
colour of brekīg of truce. The duke of Somerset by ambassadors,
&amp; not by force of armes, deuised to recouer again this pratye town, &amp; sēt
for ye restituciō of thesame, diuerse ambassadors to ye Frēch kyng &amp; his
coūsail, which made aūswere agayn, yt if the Englishmen restored to the
duke of Brytayn, the town of Fōgiers with cōdigne amēdes, for the damages
done &amp; cōmitted within the same▪ the town of Poūtlarche should
agayne be rendered and deliuered: for the Frenche kynge and his counsaill

beganne now to perceyue and smel, that the affayres of Englande,
by the death of the duke of Gloucester, were sore minished and decayed,
and that good counsaill began to waxe faynte and decay, and sedicion
freshely beganne to sprynge and ryse: By reason whereof, they thoughte
that Normandye might sone 
                     •
                  e conquered and recouered, and that the
Englishe nacion out of that region might easely be expulsed and driuē
out: wherfore they determined to take the good occasion to them openly
offered, &amp; to lose no tyme in so good a bargayne. Wherupō kyng Charles
diuided his armye in to .iij. partes, not doubting of victory, by reason
that the fame of the cōquest of Pountelarche, was blowen &amp; spread
abrode ouer al y• coūtrey. So after diuers assautes (not without losse of
diuers of his men) he had rendered to him by cōposicion, the townes of
Louiers and Gerborie, whereof Williā Harper was capitayn. Thus
prosperous victorie dayly succedinge to the Frenche kynges armye, he
augmenting his hooste, determined to get the town of Uernoyle in perche,
&amp; gyrd it round about with a strōg seage. The inhabitaūtes wherof,
although with the sodayne chaunce they were somwhat abashed, yet
hauinge some succours, and hopinge of more relefe, toke to them good
courage, and manfully defended the towne. But when their ayde taried
lenger, then they either thought or desired, they were compelled to compound
and pact with their enemyes, vpon this condicion: that if the
seage were not reysed within .xx. dayes, that then they shoulde departe
with bagge and baggage, whiche condiciō was accepted: and because
no rescous came, the town, Castel and the great Towre, were deliuered.
The Frenche historians affirme, the towne to be taken by assaute, and
the Castell by composicion, but all writers agre, that the Frenchemen
obteyned it. Thus was warre reuiued before the full terme of the truce
expyred, whiche was the moste detestable and vnprofitable chaunce,
that either could, or might haue happened or come, to the realme of England.
For by this sodayn damage &amp; losse, without thought arrising, the
Englishe capitaynes were so busyed &amp; vnquieted, what with appeasing
dayly rumors within townes, and what with studye how to recouer Castels
lost and taken, that they scace wyste, what waye to take: for while
they studied, how to kepe and defēde one citie .iiij. or .v. other, folowing
fortunes chaunce, turned to the Frenche parte, and became their enemies.
The chefe cause of which reuolting and turnīg was this: It was
blowen throughout all Fraunce, that the realme of Englande, after the
death of the duke of Gloucester, by the seueral facciōs of Princes, was
diuided in two partes, and that William de la Pole, late created duke
of Suffolke, and diuers other, were the occasion of the death of the said
duke of Gloucester, which was the very father of the countrye, and the
sheild and defence of the poore cōmonaltie, and that the forenamed duke
of Suffolke, onely for lucre of money, vexed, oppressed and molested
the poore people, so that mens myndes were not intentiue, nor geuen to
outward affayres and foren conquestes, but all theire studie was, how

to driue backe and defend domesticall iniuries, &amp; dayly wronges done
at home: by reason whereof men of warre were vnpayed, and no armye
for resistēce was either gathered or assēbled together: which mischiefes
(while the Kyng, as thinges of the worlde, and of no great moment, did
neglect and omit, as he which preferred &amp; extolled godly thinges▪ aboue
all worldly affaires and mortal cures, and thought thē most to be phā
                  tasied
and labored: And while quene Margarete his wyfe, in whom the
whole rule of the realme consisted, beyng a woman of to muche credēce
geuyng, to euil &amp; flattering cōsallors them litle regarded) dayly so much
encreased, that by no meanes after they coulde be either ouercome or resisted:
so that by this meanes, the Frenche nacion knew in what case the
state of the realme of Englande stode in, whiche elated &amp; encouraged
their hartes, and daūted &amp; appalled the courages of the Normains and
Gascoyns, so muche that for lacke of ayde and relefe, they turned to the
Frenche parte, and forsoke their very souereigne lord the king of Englande
in shorte space, as you shall here after heare.

                  ough, the realme of Englād this season thus
to be vexed and vnquieted with the busines of Normādy,
but also a new rebellion beganne in Irelande, to the great
displeasure of the Kynge and his counsaill: for repressinge
whereof, Richard duke of Yorke, with a conuenient nūber
of men was sent thither, as lieuetenant to the Kyng, which
not onely appeased the fury of the wylde, and sauage people there,
but also gat him suche loue and fauour of the countrey and the inhabitaūtes,
that their syncere loue and frēdly affeccion coulde neuer be seperated
frō him and his lygnage, as in the sequele of this story, you shall
more plainly perceyue. The Frenchemen hauing perfyte vnderstāding
of the infirmitie and vnreadinesse of the realme of Englande, displaied
their banners, and set furthe their armyes, and in shorte space gat by
yeildynge, Constance, Gisors, Castell Gayllard, Pontean du mere,
sainct Lo, Fescampe, Newchastel, Alanson, Toncque, Manleō argē
                  ton,
Lisiaux argenton, and diuers other townes in Normandy: Lykewise
in Guyen was the town of Maulissone rēdered to y• Erle of Foys.
These townes were not yelded voluntarilye by the Englishe souldiors,
but they were thereunto compelled by the cytizens and the inhabitauntes
of the townes, whiche apparantly perceyuing, that the greate flāme
of the Englishe force was extinct and consumid, rose against the Capitaines,
and other opened the gates to their enemies, or constrained them
to render vpon a composicion. By which enforcement was the rych citie
of Roan deliuered: for surely the duke of Somerset &amp; the lorde Talbot
Erle of Shrowesburye, had well kept &amp; defended this citie, if they
had bene no more vexed with the citizens, then they were with their enemyes.
For after the Frenche king had once by his Herault somoned the

citie, the inhabitaūtes not onely sought ways &amp; inuented fraudes, how
to betray the same, but also put on harnes and rebelled against their capitaynes,
manacinge to the death &amp; destruccion al the English people.
The capitaines perceyuing their vntrought, &amp; trayterous demeanour
retrayted them selfes into the Castell or Palaice, where they a certaine
space with arrowes and handgonnes, sore molested and vexed the vntrew
citizens. But when they cō
                  
                     •
                  idered the great puyssaūce of the Frēch
kyng, and that they were in dispayre of all ayde or relefe, and that their
victayle and artillarye began sore to minishe, they thoughte it better to
compounde and agree with their enemies, rather then wilfully to be destroyed
or dye for 
                     •
                  amy
                     •
                  : and so vpon condicion that all they should safely
departe of Caen with al their goodes and armure, and that certain
townes should be deliuered by a daye, they were permitted to departe:
leauing behynd them for hostages, till the sayd townes (whiche were agreed
to be rendered) should be deliuered, the Erle of Shreuesbury and
the lorde Butler, sonne to the Erle of Ormonde, which were sent to the
Castell of Eureux, because they sore feared the malice of the citizens of
Roen. The Frenchemen folowyng still the steppes of victorie, &amp; elated
with the brute and fame of gettinge of Roen, determined either by force
or offer, to get the towne of Harfflew, and shortely assauted thesame,
wherof was capitayn syr Thomas Coneson, a man of great witt and of
no lesse force: which hauing knowledge of the heauy tidinges, brougth
from Roen, was therewith nothinge abashed, but coragiously set vpon
his enemies, and them to their great hurt, manfully repulsed and draue
from the walles. The Frenchemen learning wit by this great perill, left
their scalynge, and deuised dayly, howe to batter and breake the walles
&amp; fortificaciōs. This seage long continued to the great losse of both
parties. When syr Thomas sawe smal lykelihod of ayde or gayne, but
muche apparaunce of losse and ieopardy, he toke a conuencion with his
enemyes, and so departed with all his goodes.

                     AFTER whiche towne rendered, the fortresse of Hunflew,
vpon the same composicion was yeilded. Thus you may
perceyue, that fortune is euer without measure, for either
she to muche fauoreth or to muche hateth: for beside these
townes surrendered in Normandy, the duke of Britayne
recouered agayne Fongiers, sent Ihon de Buerne and
diuers other townes. In the meane season, the king of England sent into
Normandy with a crew of .M. and .ccccc. men, a valiaunt capitayn,
called syr Thomas Kyriel: a man of great stomacke, if he had hadde a
great armye but his power was to small, either to recouer that whiche
was lost, either to saue that, whiche yet remayned vngotten: but surely
in him lacked neither good will nor courage, for with his small numbre,
he recouered agayn the townes of Lyseaux and Ualongnes. After

whiche feate, he ioyned hymself with sir Hēry Norbery, sir Robert
Ueere, Matthew Gough, and other capitaines, so that thei were aboue
fiue thousande men▪ of valiaunt hartes and haute courages. After long
consultacion, thei determined to fight with the Frenchemen, whiche wer
gooyng to the siege of Caen, but in their iourney, thei were encountered
at a place called Formigny, betwene Carentyne and Bayeux, by the
erle of Cleremont, lieuetenaunt for the Frenche kyng, the Stewarde of
Poytou, and the lorde of Rays Admirall of Fraunce, with sixe hundred
men of armes, and sixe thousand other, whiche skirmished with the Englishemen
a greate season. Duryng whiche s
                     •
                  irmishe, there arriued Arthur
erle of Richemond, high Constable of Fraunce, Iames of Luxenborough,
erle of Lauall, with a greate numbre of horsemen and freshe
fotemen. After his commyng, he and all the Frenchmen set on thenglishmen,
beyng faint and wery with the long skirmishe. This battaill was
sore fought, but in conclusiō, the Englishemen wer discomfited, and put
to flight, and of theim slain aboue iiij.M, and .viii.C. taken prisoners,
where of, sir Thomas Kiriell, sir Henry Norbery, &amp; sir Thomas Dreue
wer the chief, sir Robert Uere and Matthewe Gough saued themselfes.
This was the first foughten feld, that the Frenchemen gatte on the Englishemen
in many yeres, wherfore, I blame theim not, though thei of a
litle, make muche, and set furthe all, and hide nothyng, that maie sounde
to their glory. Thei declare what nūbre thei slew, but thei write not how
many of them wer slain nor destroyed.
               
                  AFTER this victory obteined, the Frenche kyng hearyng that the
Duke of Somerset was in the toune of Caen, thought that he had nothyng
doen, if he permitted the duke, still to tary in Normandy, whiche
by newe aide and freshe succors, might turne the whele of Fortune, into
a contrary parte, and peraduenture recouer all that hath been loste, or
put the realme of Fraunce in ieoperdy: wherefore, like a wise prince, entendyng
to preuent thynges, imminent &amp; at hande, assembled an armie
royall, &amp; in his awne persone, hauyng in his campe Reyner, called kyng
of Scicile, father to the Quene of Englande, the dukes of Calaber and
Alaunson, the erles of Cleremont, Richemond, Mayne, Dumoys, Sent
Polle, and Dampemartyne, beside many noble Barons and valiaunte
knightes, when all thynges were ready, as opportunitie of tyme serued:
He caused the Toune to bee enuironed on euery side, assignyng
to his capitaines seuerall places of the toune to bee assauted, and there
to proue their manhod. The erle of Dumoys, with more losse then gain
entered into a bulwerke and was beaten backe. Thenglishemen within
the toune kept silence, as though thei knewe not of their enemies approchyng,
but euery man kept his loupe, and euery capitain well ouerloked
his ward. The Frenchemen with quarrelles, morispikes, slynges,
and other engynes, began to assaut the walles: but of the Englishemen
within, some shot fiercely withlong bowes, other cast dartes, and rolled
doune greate stones and barres of Iron: other cast doune Iauelyns,

firebrādes, hote leade, and blockes with pitche and brymstone, like burnyng

                     •
                  ire flamyng: some cast doune and ouerthrewe the scalyng ladders
and slewe suche as clymed vp the walles: neither courage lacked in the
assault, nor manhode, nor pollecie in the def
                     •
                  nce: for on the embatelmē
                  tes
of the walles wer set greate rolles of tymbre, so mouyng and vnstedfaste,
that neither scalyng ladder could catche any holde, nor no persone
that should clyme vp, could set any sure fotyng. The French kyng▪ perceiuyng
that this assaye litle or nought preuailed hym, sent for all his
greate ordinaunce to Paris, determinyng neuer to departe, till he had
conquered the toune, either with sworde or famyn. When the ordinaūce
was brought, he daily shot at the walles, and did some hurte: but to the
Castle, whiche stode on a rocke, and in it a dongeon vnhable to be beaten
doune, he did no harme at all. In this toune was the duke of Somerset,
his wife and children, but he was not capitain, for the Duke of
Yorke owner of the toune, by the kynges gifte, had appoynted there his
capitain generall, sir Dauy Halle, and of the castle, sir Rober Ueer, and
of the dongeon, sir Henry Radford. Daily the shot was greate, but more
terrible then hurtfull. Sauyng one daie, a stone shot into the toune, fel
betwene the duches of Somerset, and her children, whiche, beyng amased
with this chaunce, praied on her knees her husbande, to haue mercy
and compassion of his small enfantes, and that thei might bee deliuered
out of ye toune in sauegard. The duke more piteous then hardy, moued
with the dolor of his wife, and loue of his children, assembled the capitaines
and magistrates of the toune, declaryng to theim, the power and
puyssaunce of the Frenche kyng, and their debilitie and weakenes, perswadyng
theim rather to yeld and rendre vpon honest condicions, then
obstinatly to resist, and foolishly to perishe. Sir Dauy Halle, capitain
of the toune, aunswered to hym, saiyng: my lorde, although you bee the
kynges lieuetenaunt generall, within this countrey and dominion, and
maie by force of your aucthoritie, deliuer, sell or geue, any of the kynges
tounes, to suche persones, either frendes or enemies, as shall please you:
yet I am sure that you cut your lether to large, to intreate or speake of
the renderyng of this toune, apperteinyng to my lord &amp; master, Richard
duke of Yorke, whiche thereof hath geuen me bothe the charge and custody▪
with other of my trusty frendes and felowes, and whiche with the
helpe of almightie God, I shall well defende, bothe against the Frenche
kyng and all his puyssaunce, till the duke my master come to succor me:
for of men, money and municions, I trust I haue sufficient. Why saied
the duke, am not I here the kynges deputie, representyng his persone, &amp;
maie commaunde all thynges accordyng to my discrecion? Yea, said the
capitain, so that you geue away no mānes right, but his, whose aucthoritie
you haue for thesame: as for this toune, I assure you, without my
lordes assent, you shall neither render nor yelde, by my consent or agrement.
The duke was sore moued with this saiyng, and so departed, and
after sent for the rulers of the toune, and the poorest people of thesame,

declaryng to them, that their lifes and goodes, wer in the Frenche kynges
handes, and if thei looked not shortely to their sauegard, of death
thei were sure, and of mercie farre vncertain: exhortyng theim to folowe
his louyng monicion, rather then the hardened harte, of their to hardie
capitain. The people of the toune thus perswaded (whose hartes wer rather
Frenche then Englishe) began to rise against sir Dauy, boldely affirmyng,
that if he tooke no composicion, within three daies, thei would
open the gates, and let in the Frenche kyng: and of this opinion, wer all
the common souldiours. What should the poore Hare saie, when she is
enuironed with a hundred houndes, or the silly Larke crye, when she is
in the middell of a hundred Hawkes, but take pacience, and seke awaie
to escape: so this capitain perceiuyng, that neither his woordes serued,
nor his truthe toward his master preuailed, bad the duke of Somerset
do what he list, for he would in no wise be named in y• composiciō. Then
the duke partely to pleace the tounes men, but more desirous to pleace
the duches his wife, made an agrement with the Frenche kyng, that he
would rendre the toune, so that he and all his, might depart in sauegard
with all their goodes and substaunce: whiche offre, the Frenche Kyng
gladly accepted and allowed, knowyng that by force, he might lenger
haue longed for the strong toune, then to haue possessed thesame so sone.
After this conclusion taken, sir Dauie Halle, with diuerse other of his
trustie frēdes, departed to Chierburge, and from thense sailed into Irelande,
to the duke of Yorke, makyng relacion to hym of all these dooynges:
whiche thyng kyndeled so greate a rancore in his harte &amp; stomacke
that he neuer lefte persecutyng of the Duke of Somersette, till he had
brought hym to his fatall poynt, and extreme confusion.
               
                  AFTER the obteinyng of this strong toune of 
                     •
                  aen, therle of Cleremont
besieged the citie of Lyseux, whereof was capitain Matthewe
Gough, with thre hundren Englishmen. The capitain perceiuyng that
when Caen was not rescewed, that poore Liseux, was in dispaire of all
succor, agreed to abandon and deliuer the citee, so that he and his people,
might departe to Chierburge, hauyng no yron weapon nor armure,
but onely their goodes, and white stafes in their handes. After the deliueraunce
of this toune, the Frenchemen stil like good begeles, folowyng
their preye, besieged the toune of Fallayse, apperteinyng to the lord
Talbot, erle of Shrewesbury: whereof wer capitaines for thesaied erle,
Andrewe Trollop, and Thomas Cotton esquires, whiche beyng desperate
of succors, and consideryng the puissaunce of their enemies, agreed
to deliuer the toune vpon twoo condicions. The one was, that the Erle
their master, whiche remained in pledge for certain condicions, agreed
to bee perfourmed at the deliueraunce of Roen, (as you haue heard before)
should be dismissed &amp; set at libertie. The other, that if thei wer not
rescued within twelfe daies, that then, thei and theirs, to depart with armure,
and all their godes moueable, whether it pleaced them. After this
agrement at the daie prefixed, no rescues came, and so the toune was rē
                  dered,

and incontinent after, the fortresse of Dampforde was deliuered
vpon like agrement. For the Frenchemen bragged, that thei regarded
neither golde nor siluer, but desired rule, glory, and fame: With whiche
lightne
                     •
                  e the other tounes of Normandy beyng perswaded, voluntarily
rendered themselfes, vassalles and subiectes to the Frenche nacion.
               
                  NOVV rested English, onely the toune of Chierburge, wherof was
capitain, Thomas Gonuile, which surely, valiaūtly defended the toune
as long as vitail and municion serued: but when those two handes wer
spent and consumed, he destitute of all comforte and aide, vpon a reasonable
composiciō, yelded the toune and went to Caleis, where the duke
of Somerset, and many Englishemen then soiorned: lamentyng their
losse, and desperate of all recouery. Thus was the riche duchie of Normandy
lost, yt whiche had continued in thenglishmennes possession .xxx.
yeres by the cōquest of Kyng Henry the fifth. In the whiche duchie wer
a hundred strong tounes and fortresses, hable to be kept and holden, beside
theim whiche wer destroyed by the warres, and in thesame was one
Archebishopricke, and sixe bishoprickes. Some saie, that the Englishemen
wer not of puyssaunce, either to man the tounes as thei should beeor
to inhabite the countrey, whiche was the cause, that thei could not,
kepe it: accordyng to the Frenchemennes Adage, whiche saieth: A man
cannot long hold that, whiche he cannot gripe. Other say, that the duke
o
                     •
                   Somerset, for his awne peculier profite, kept not halfe his nombre of

                     •
                  ouldiors, and put their wages in his purse. These be mennes imaginacions
and coniectures, but surely the losse of it, was the domesticall diuision
within the realme euery greate man desiryng, rather to be reuenged
on his foo at home, then on his outward enemie, as you now shall
manifestly se and perceiue.

                  FOR while these conquestes wer obteined in the partes
beyond the sea, with sworde speare, and target, by
the aduersaries of the Englishmen, thre mischeuous
capitaines, set the people of the Realme (aswell of the
nobilitie, as of the meane sorte) in a ciuill warre and
intestine diuision: For emong the high Princes and
peeres, reigned inward grudge: emong the Cleargie,
adulacion, &amp; emong the commonaltie, disdain of lasciuious souereigntie
whiche the Quene with her minions, and vnprofitable counsailers daily
toke and vsurped vpō them. Wherfore thei (not myndyng to be more
charged, then their backes would beare, and perceiuyng that by the negligent
prouision, and improuident pollicie of the wit wantyng gouernors
within the realme, the affaires and businesse in the partes beyonde
the sea, daily decaied and more wer like to do, if other pollitique rulers
were put in aucthoritie, and the negligent officers, sequestered and deposed,)
began to make exclamacion against the Duke of Suffolke, affirming

him, to be the onely cause of the deliuery of Angeow &amp; Mayne,
the chief procurer of the death, of the good duke of Gloucester, the verie
occasion of the losse of Normandy, the moste swallower vp and consumer
of the Kynges treasure, (by reason whereof, the warres in Fraunce
wer not mainteined,) the expeller frō the kyng, of al good and verteous
counsailors, and the brynger in and auauncer of vicious persones,
common enemies and apparaunt aduersaries to the publique wealthe:
So that the duke was called in euery mannes mouth, a traitor, a murderer,
a robber of the kynges treasure, and worthy to bee put to moste
cruell punishement. By reason of this exclamaciō, the Quene somewhat
fearyng the destruccion of the Duke, but more the confusion of her self,
caused the Parliament, before begon at the blacke Friers in London,
to be adiorned to Leicester, thinkyng there, by force and rigor of ye law,
to subdue and represse all the malice and euill will, conceiued againste
the Duke and her: at whiche place fewe of the nobilitie would appere,
wherefore it was again adiorned to Westminster, where was a whole
company and a ful apparaunce. In the whiche session, the commons of
the neither house, put vp to the Kyng, and the Lordes, many articles of
treason, misprision and misdemeanoure, against the duke of Suffolke:

and doo all thynges accordyng to his discresion, for the obteinyng of a

to the kynges enemies, the kynges counsaill, purueiaunce

not in the leage, as the kynges Alies, neither the kyng of Arragon,
neither the duke of Brytayne, but suffered them to be comprised on the
contrary partye, by reason wherof, the olde amitie of the kyng of Arragon,
is estraunged from this realme, and the duke of Britayne become
enemy to thesame: and Giles his brother the Kynges suer frende, cast in
strong prison, and their lyke to ende and finishe his dayes.
               
                  AL these obiections he vtterly denyed, or fayntely auoyded, but not
fully excused. Diuers other crymes were layde to his charge, as, enrychyng
hymselfe with the Kynges goodes and landes, gatheryng together,
and makyng a money polde of offices, fees, wardes, and fermes, by
reason wherof, the Kynges estate was greatly mynished and decayed,
and he and his kyn highly exalted, and enriched, with many other pointes,
whiche, by cause they be not notable, nor of no great force or strēgth
I omitte and ouerpasse. The Quene, whiche entierly loued the Duke,
fearyng that some cōmocion and trouble myght ryse, if he were let goo
vnpunished, caused him to be committed to the Towre, where he was
kepte with as muche pleasure, as he that was at large, and oute of all
captiuitie. But after that a moneth was expired, she ymagenynge the
people to be pacified with this open emprysonement, caused him bothe
to be deliuered, and also to be restored to the Kinges fauour and grace,
as muche as euer he was before that tyme. But this doynge incensed
the furye of the mutable cōmons, muche more then before: openly demouncyng,
and saiyng, that it was a shame to al the Realme, to se such
a persone, infected with so many misdedes, either to rule about a prince
or be had in honor. Of these wordes sprang dedes, and of this talkyng,
rose displeasure, whiche had growen to greate mischiefe, if pollitique
prouision had not, with all celeritie resisted the fyrst fury: for the commons
in sundry places of the realme assembled together, gathered great
companyes, and elected a Capitayn, whome they called, blew berd: but
or they had attempted any enterpryse, their headdes were apprehended
and so the membres sodainly were dispersed, without any hurte cōmitted,
or perpetrated.
               
                  AFTER this litle rage was asswaged, the Parliament was adiornied
to Leycester, whither came the Kyng and the Quene in great estate
and with them the Duke of Suffolke, as chefe counsailor. The cōmōs
of the lower house, not forgettyng their olde grudge: beseched the king,
that such persons, as assented to the relese of Angeow, and deliueraunce
of Mayne, might be extremely punished, and tormented: and to be priuye
to this facte, they accused, as principal, the duke of Suffolke, with
Ihon bishop of Salisbury, and syr Iames Fynies, lord Say, &amp; diuers
other. When kyng Henry perceiued, that the cōmons wer thus stomacked
and bent, against the Quenes dearlynge William Duke of Suffolke,
he playnly sawe, that neither glosyng wolde serue, nor dissimulacion
coulde appeace, the continual clamor of the importunate cōmons:
Wherefore to begyn a shorte pacificacion in so long a broyle. Firste he

sequestred the lord Say, beynge threasorer of Englande, and other the
Dukes adherentes, from there offices, and authoritie, and after banished
and put in exile the duke of Suffolke, as the abhorred tode, and
cōmon noysaunce of the Realme of Englande, for the terme of .v. yeres:
meaning by this exile, to appeace the furious rage of ye outragious people,
and that pacified, to reuocate him into his olde estate, as the Quenes
chefe frēde &amp; counsailer. But fortune wold not, that this flagitious
person, shoulde so escape: for when he shipped in Suffolke, entendynge
to be transported into Fraūce, he was encōtered with a shippe of warre
apperteynyng to the duke of Excester,William de la poole, duke o
                        •
                      Suffolke behedded. the Constable of the Towre of
London, called the Nicholas of the Towre. The capitayne of thesame
barke with small fight, entered into the dukes shyppe, and perceyuyng
his person present, brought him to Douer Rode, &amp; there on the one syde
of a cocke bote▪ caused his head to be stryken of, and left hys body with
the heade vpon the sandes of Douer, which corse was there founde by
a chapelayne of his, and conueyed to Wyngfelde college in Suffolke,
and there buried. This ende had Williā de la pole, first duke of Suffolke,
as men iudge, by Gods punyshmēt: for aboue all thinges he was
noted to be the very organ, engine, and diuiser of the destruccion of Hū
                  frey
the good duke of Gloucester, and so the bloudde of the Innocente
mā was with his dolorous death, recompensed and punished. But the
death of this froward person, and vngracious patron, brought not the
Realme quyete, nor deliuered it from all inward grudge, and intestine
diuision, which to all Realmes is more pestiferous and noysome, then
outward warre, dayly famyne, or extreme pestilēce. For allthough Rychard
duke of Yorke, was in pryson, (as the kynges deputie) in ye realm
of Irelande, continually resyaunt there, yet his breath puffed, and hys
wynde blew dayly, in many partes of the Realme. For many of the nobilitie,
and more of the meane estate, wisely ponderynge the estate and
condicion of the Realme, perceyuynge more losse then encrease, more
ruyne then auancement, dayly to ensue: Remembryng also that Fraūce
was conquered, and Normandy was gayned, by the Frenche people in
shorte space, thought with them selfes and imagened, that the faulte of
all these miserable chaunces, happened, either because the Kynge was
not the true enheritor to the crowne, or that he or his counsaill were not
able of wit, pollicie, and circumspeccion, to rule and gouerne so noble a
Realme, or so famous a region. Upon this coniecture the frendes, kinsmen
and alyes of the duke of Yorke, which were of no small nūber, began
to practise the gouernaūce of his title: Infusyng and puttyng into
mens heades secretely his right to ye crown, his pollitique gouernaūce,
his gentle behauior, to all the Iryshe nacion, affirming, that he whiche
had brought that rude and sauage nacion, to ciuile fashion, and Englishe
vrbanitie, wolde, (if he once ruled in the Realme of England) depose
euil counsaillers, correct euil iudges, &amp; reforme al matters amisse,
and vnamēded. And to set opē the fludde gates of these deuises, it was

thought necessary, to cause some great com
                     •
                  ociō and rysyng of people
to be made against the King: so that if they preuayled, then had the duke
of Yorke and his complices, there appetite and desire. And because
the Kentishmen be impacient in wronges, disdayning of to much
oppression, and euer desirous of new chaung, and new fangelnes. The,
ouerture of this matter was put furthe fyrste in Kent, and to thentent
that it should not be knowen, that the duke of Yorke or his frēdes were
the cause of the sodayne rising: A certayn yongmā of a goodely stature,
and pregnaunt wit, was entised to take vpon him the name of Ihon
Mortymer, all though his name were Ihon Cade, and not for a small
policie, thinking that by that surname, the lyne and lynage of the assistente
house of the erle of Marche, which were no small number, should
be to hym both adherent, and fauorable. This capitayn not onely suborned
by techers, but also enforced by pryuye scholemasters, assembled
together a great company of talle personages: assuring them, that their
attēpt was both honorable to God and the king, and also profitable to
the common wealth, promisyng them, that if either by force or pollicie,
they might once take the kyng, the Quene, &amp; other their counsaillers, in
to their handes and gouernaūce, that they woulde honorabl
                     •
                  e entreate
the kyng, and so sharply handle his counsaillers, that neither fiftenes
should hereafter be demaūded, nor once any imposicions, or tax, should
be spoken of. These perswasions, with many other fayre promises of libertie,
(whiche the common people more affect &amp; desire, rather then reasonable
obedience, and due conformitte) so animated the Kentishe people,
that they with their capitayne aboue named, in good order of battell
(not in great number) came to the playne of Blackehethe, betwene
Eldham and Grenewyche. And to the entent that the cause of this glorious
capitaines comyng thither, might be shadowed from the kyng
and his counsaill, he sent to hym an humble supplicacion, with louyng
woordes, but with malicious entent: affirmyng his cōmyng, not to be
agaynst him, but agaynst diuers of his co
                     •
                  nsail, louers of them selfes,
and oppressers of the pore commonaltie, flatterers to the kyng and enemyes
to his honor, suckers of his purse, and robbers of his subiectes,
perciall to their frendes, and extreme to their enemies, for rewardes corrupted,
and for indifferencie, nothing doyng. This proude byll, was
both of the kyng, and his counsaill, disdainfully taken, and thereupon
great consultacion had, and after long debating, it was concluded, that
suche proude rebelles, should rather be suppressed and tamed, with violence
and force, then with fayre woordes or amycable aunswer:
               Wherupon the king assembled a great army, and marched toward thē,
whiche had lyen on Blackeheath, by the space of .vij. dayes. The subtill
capitayn named Iack Cade, entendyng to bryng the kyng farther,
within the compasse of his net, brake vp his Campe, and retyred backwarde
to the towne of Seuenocke in Kent, and there exspectynge hys
pray, encamped him selfe, and made his abode. The Quene, which bare

the rule, beyng of his retrayte well aduertised, sent syr Humfrey Stafford
knyght, and William his brother with many other gentelmen, to
folow the chace of the Kentishmen, thinkynge that they had fledde, but
verely, they were desceyued: for at the fyrst skyrmish, both the Staffordes
were slayne, and all their companye shamfully discomfited. The
kynges armye, beyng at this tyme come to Blackeheathe, hearynge of
this discomfiture, began to grudge and murmure emongest them selfe:
some wisshing the duke of Yorke at home, to ayde the capitayne his cosyne:
some desiryng the ouerthrow of the kyng and his counsaill: other
openly cryeng out on the Quene, and her complices. This rumor opēly
spoken, &amp; cōmoly published, caused the kyng, &amp; certayn of his counsaill,
not ledde by fauor, nor corrupted by rewardes (to the entent to appeace
the furious rage of the inconstant multitude) to commit the lord Say,
Threasorer of England, to the Towre of London: and if other, against
whome, lyke displeasure was borne had been presente, thei had likewise
ben serued. But it was necessary that one should suffer, rather then all
the nobilitie then should perish. When the Kentish capitayn, or ye couetous
Cade, had thus obteyned victory, and slayne the two valeaunt
Staffordes, he apparreled hym selfe in their rych armure, and soo with
pompe and glory returned agayn toward London: in whiche retrayte
diuers idle and vacabonde persons, resorted to him from Sussex and
Surrey, and from other partes to a great nūber. Thus this glorious
Capitayn, compassed about, and enuironed with a multitude of euil rude
and rusticall persones, came agayn to the playn of Blackeheath, and
there strōgly encamped him selfe: to whome were sent by the kynge, the
Archebishop of Canterbury, and Humfrey duke of Buckyngham, to
cōmon with him of hys greues and requestes. These lordes found him
sober in communicacion, wyse in disputyng, arrogant in hart, and styfe
in his opinion, and by no ways possible, to be perswaded to dissolue his
armye, except the kynge in person wolde come to him, and assent to all
thinges, which he should requyre. These lordes, perceyuyng the wilful
pertinacy, and manifest contumacie of this rebellious Iauelyn, departed
to the kyng, declaring to hym, his temerarious and rasshe wordes,
and presumptuous requestes. The kyng somwhat hearyng, and more
markyng the saiynges of thys outragious losel, and hauyng dayly reporte
of the concurse and accesse of people, which cōtinually resorted to
him, doubtyng asmuch his familiar seruauntes, as his vnknowē subiectes
(which spared not to speake, that the capitaynes cause, was profitable
for the common wealth) departed in all haste to the castell of Kylyngworthe
in Warwyckeshyre, leauing only behynd him ye lord Scales,
to kepe the Towre of London. The capitayn beynge aduertised of
the kynges absence, came first into Southwarke, and there lodged at
the white hart, prohibity
                     •
                  g to all men, Murder, Rape, or Robbery: by
whiche colour he allured to him the hartes of the common people. But
after that he entered into Londō, and cut the ropes of the draw bridge,

strykyng his sworde on London stone, saiyng: now is Mortymer lorde
of this citie, and rode in euery strete lyke a lordly Capitayn. And after
a flatteryng declaracion made to the Mayre of the citie of his thither
commyng, he departed agayn in to Southwarke. And vpon the thyrde
daye of Iulij, he caused syr Iames Fynes lord Say, and Threasorer
of Englande, to be brought to the Gylde halle of London, and there to
be arrayned: whiche beyng before the kynges iustices put to aunswere,
desired to be tryed by his peeres, for the lenger delay of his life.The lorde Say, threasorer of Englande, behedded at the stā
                     dard in

                        •
                     ape. The
Capitayne perceiuyng his dilatorie ple, by force toke him from the officers,
and brought him to the standard in Cheape, and there before his
confession ended, caused his head to be cut of, and pitched it on a highe
poole, which was opēly borne before hym through the stretes. And this
cruell tyraunt not content with the murder of the lorde Say, wente to
Myle ende, and there apprehended syr Iames Cromer, then shreue of
Kent, and sonne in law to the sayd lord Say, &amp; hym without confession
or excuse heard, caused there likewyse to be hedded, and his head to be
fixed on a poole, and with these two heddes, this blody butcher entered
into the citie agayn, and in despyte caused them in euery strete, kysse to
gether, to the great detestacion of all the beholders.
               
                  AFTER this shamefull murder, succeded open rapyn and manifest
robbery in diuers houses, within the citie, and in especiall in the house
of Philip Malpas, Alderman of London, and diuers other: ouer &amp;
besyde raunsonyng, &amp; fynyng of diuers notable marchauntes, for the
tuyciō and securitie of their lyfes and goodes, as Robert Horne alderman,
which payed .v.C. markes, and yet neither he, nor no other person
was either of lyfe or substance in a suertie or sauegard. He also put to
execucion in Southwarke diuers persons, some for infryngyng his rules
and preceptes, bycause he wolde be sene indifferent, other he tormē
                  ted
of his olde acquayntance, lest they shoulde blase &amp; declare his base
byrthe, and lowsy lynage, disparagyng him from his vsurped surname
of Mortymer, for the which, he thought and doubted not, both to haue
frendes and fautors, both in Londō, Kent, and Essex. The wise Mayre,
and sage magistrates of the citie of London, perceyuyng thē selfes, neither
to be sure of goodes nor of lyfe well warranted, determined with
feare to repel and expulse this mischeuous head, and hys vngracious
cōpany. And because the lord Scales was ordeyned keper of ye Towre
of London, with Mathew Gough, the often named capitayne in Normandy,
(as you haue harde before) they purposed to make them pryuye
both of their entent and enterprise. The lord Scales promised thē hys
ayde, with shoting of ordinaunce, and Mathew Goughe was by hym
appoynted, to assist the Mayre and the Londoners: bycause he was
both of manhode, and experience greatly renoumed and noysed. So y•
Capitaynes of the citie appointed, toke vpon them in the night to kepe
the bridge of London, prohibiting the Kentishmē, either to passe or approche.
The rebelles, which neuer soundly slepte, for feare of sodayne

chaunces, hearing the brydge to be kept and manned, ran with greate
haste to open that passage, where betwene bothe partes was a ferce and
cruell encounter. Mathew Gough, more experte in marcial feates, then
the other cheuetaynes of the citie, perceiuyng the Kentishmen, better to
stande to their taclyng, then his imaginacion expected, aduised his cō
                  pany
no further to procede, toward Southwarke, till the day appered:
to the entent, that the citezens hearing where the place of the ieopardye
rested, might occurre their enemies, and releue their frendes and companions.
But this counsail came to small effect: for the multitude of ye
rebelles draue the citezens from the stoulpes at the bridge foote, to the
drawe bridge, and began to set fyre in diuers houses. Alas what sorow
it was to beholde that miserable chaunce: for some desyringe to eschew
the fyre, lept on his enemies weapon, and so died: fearfull women with
chyldren in their armes, amased and appalled, lept into the riuer: other
doubtinge how to saue them self betwene fyre, water, and swourd, were
in their houses suffocat and smoldered. Yet the Capitayns nothing regarding
these chaunces, fought on the draw bridge all the nighte valeauntly,
but in conclusion, the rebelles gate the draw bridge, and drowned
many, and 
                     ••
                  ew Ihon Sutton alderman, and Robert Heysande a
hardy citizen, with many other, beside Mathew Gough, a man of great
wit, much experience in feates of chiualrie, the which in continual warres,
had valeauntly serued the kyng, and his father, in the partes beyōd
the sea (as before ye haue hearde). But it is often sene, that he, whiche
many tymes hath vanqueshed his enemies in straūg countreys, and returned
agayn as a conqueror, hath of his awne nacion afterward been
shamfully murdered, and brought to confusion. This hard and sore cō
                  flict
endured on the bridge, til .ix. of the clocke in the morninge, in doutfull
chaunce, and fortunes balaunce: for some tyme the Lōdoners were
bet back to the stulpes at sainct Magnes corner, and sodaynly agayne
the rebelles were repulsed and driuen backe, to the stulpes in Southwarke,
so that both partes, beyng faynte, wery and fatigate, agreed to
desist from fight, and to leue battail til the next day, vpon condicion: y•
neither Londoners should passe into Southwarke, nor the Kentishmē
in to London.
               
                  AFTER this abstinence of warre agreed, the lusty Kentishe Capitayne,
hopyng on more frendes, brake vp the gayles of the Kinges benche
and Marshalsea, and set at libertie, a swarme of gallātes, both mete
for his seruice and apte for his enterprise. The Archebishop of Canterbury,
beyng then Chauncelor of England, and for his suerty lyenge in
the Towre of London, called to him the Bishop of Winchester, whiche
also for feare, lurked at Halywell. These two prelates seyng the fury of
the Kentish people, by reason of their betyng backe, to be mitigate and
minished, passed the ryuer of Thamyse from the Towre, into Souhtwarke,
bringing with them vnder the kynges great seale, a general pardon
vnto all the offendors: which they caused to be openly proclamed &amp;

published. Lorde how glad the poore people were of this Pardone (ye
more then of the great Iubile of Rome) and how thei accepted thesame,
in so muche that the whole multitude, without biddyng farewel to their
capitain, retired thesame night, euery man to his awne home, as men amased,
and strikē with feare. But Ihon Cade desperate of succors, whiche
by the frendes of the duke of Yorke wer to hym promised, and seyng
his cōpany thus without his knowledge sodainly depart, mistrustyng
the sequele of ye matter, departed secretly in habite disguysed, into Sussex:
but all his metamorphosis or transfiguracion, litle preuailed. For
after a Proclamacion made, that whosoeuer could apprehende thesaied
Iac Cade, should haue for his pain, a.M. markes, many sought for him,
but few espied hym, til one Alexander Iden, esquire of Kent, found hym
in a garden, and there in his defence, manfully slewe the cai

brought his ded body to London, whose hed was set on Londō bridge.
This is the successe of all rebelles, and this fortune chaunceth euer to
traytors. For where men striue against the streame, their bote neuer cō
                  meth
to his pretensed porte.
               
                  AFTER this commocion, the kyng hymself came into Kent, &amp; there
sat in iudgement vpō the offendors, and if he had not mitigated his iustice,
with mercie and compassion, more then fiue .C. by the rigor of his
lawe, had been iustely put to execucion: but he cōsidered, bothe their fragilitie
and innocencie, and how thei with peruerse people, were seduced
and deceiued: and so punished the stubburne heddes, and deliuered the
ignorāt &amp; miserable people, to the greate reioysyng of all his subiectes.
               
                  DVRYNG this commocion aboute London, Raufe bishop of Salisbury,
was by his awne tenantes, &amp; seruaūtes, murdered at Edyngton,

whiche hearyng of the yeldyng of Roen, and conquest of Normandy,
consideryng the puyssaunce of the Frenche army, vpon reasonable
condiciōs, rendered the toune: yet all this notwithstandyng, the lord
Cameyse, sir George Seymour, sir Ihon Arundell, and other valiaunt
capitaines, whiche had the gouernance of the countrey, manned tounes
gathered people, and animated the cold stomackes of the fearefull Gascons:
requiryng them to be constant in their fidelitie, true to their natural
prince and vndoubted souereigne lorde, sendyng daily letters to the

kyng of Englande and his counsaill, declaryng to him the weakenes of
his subiectes, and the strength of his enemies, assertenyng hym for a suertie,
that without spedy aide, and redy succors, the whole countrey were
like to be gotten frō his possessiō. Many letters wer sent, and many faire
aunswers wer brought, but relief neither appered, nor one man of warre
was thether shipped. By reason wherof, the Gascoyns perceiuyng their
enemies at hand, intendyng aswell to destroy the countrey, as to subdue
the people, began euery man for hymself, to regard nothyng, but the sauyng
of their tounes, goodes, and corne: neglectyng defence, and fearful
of assaultes, least by small resistence, thei might receiue more detriment,
then after thei could recouer again, either with great force, or muche labor.
But thenglishmen, (whose natures are not to be faint harted, euen
at the very ieoperdy of death) with al their wittes studied, bothe how to
repulse &amp; conuince their enemies, &amp; to turne awaie the euil chances whiche
thei sawe likely, (if pollicie did not helpe) sodainly to fal, and shortly
to insue. But al their pollices litle preuailed in cōclusion, because succors
failed, and force wanted: For afther the Frenchemen, had the toune
of Bergerac to them rendered, the fortresses of Io
                     •
                  sac, of Bonefoy, and
diuerse other places, willyngly &amp; frely, yelded themselfes to the Frenche
subieccion. Duryng whiche tyme, 
                     〈◊〉
                   lorde Doruall, third sonne to the
lorde Delabreth, with a greate numbre of men, aswel on horssebacke as
on foote, departed from Basas, to conquere and destroy the isle of Madoce:
wherof hearyng the Maire of Burdeaux, with a conuenient crewe
of men, issued out of the citie, and encontered with his enemies, betwene
whom, was a hard fight and a dedly battaill: but the Frenchemen, more
with multitude, then with force, vanquished thenglishemen, and killed
and toke prisoners, aboue .vj.C. Englishmen and Gascoynes, but of the
Frenchemen, whiche wer in double numbre, aboue their aduersaries (as
writers affirme) there wer slain .viii.C. persones. For whiche cause, the
capitaines folowed no farther the chace, lest the Englishe people would
again returne. This slaughter of the Englishe parte, the Frenche writers
set furthe with the moste, but of their awne losse, thei speake not one
worde. Suche indifferency, is in their Chronographiers. This discomfiture
so amased the wittes, &amp; appalled the hartes of the meane Gascons
that thei offered many tounes to the French part, before thesame wer of
them demaunded.
               
                  AFTER this, the Bastard of Orleaunce, erle of Dumoys, and Lō
                  guile,
lieuetenant generall for the Frenche kyng, accompanied with his
brother, Ihon erle of Angulesme, whiche had been long prisoner in England,
and many valiant capitaines, and expert men of warre, besieged
the Castle of Montguyon, whiche to them was rendered. After this, the
saied army besieged the fortresse of Blay, standyng on the riuer of Gyrond,
whiche toune is the very keye of the porte of Burdeaux, and this
toune was besieged bothe by water and by lande, and fiersly assaulted
and manfully defended, and in conclusion by very force, for lacke of resistence,

conquered and gayned. The bastard of Kendall capitain of the
Castle, seyng the toune lost, vpon certain condicions, deliuered his 
                     •
                  ortresse,
into the possession of the lord lieuetenant. After this toune gained
the fortresses of Bourge and Liburne yelded, not without fiue Wekes

                  iuyng fortunes fauor towardes
them, thought it necessary to take the tyme, while their good planet reigned.
Wherfore, to preuent the aide of the Englishmen, whom thei daily
expected to come to the succor of their people: thei appoynted foure
armies, to make war in foure seuerall partes. The lorde Charles Dellebreth,
accompainied with Ihon lorde of Tartas and Aymon, lorde of
Doruall his sonnes, and therle of Foys, and the Uiscount Lawtrec his
brother, and many noble men of Guyen, laied siege to the toune of Acques,

                  on in
Perigot, and the erle of Dumoys, enuironed with a great puyssance the
toune of Fronsacke. Thenglishemen within this toune, perceiuyng the
greate ordinaunce on the Frenche part, and the small prouision on their
side, couenanted with thesaid erle, that if the toune wer not succored, and
the Frenchemen foughten with all, before the feast of the natiuitie, of .s.
Ihō Baptist next ensuyng, that then the toune of Fronsacke should be
yelded to them, whiche was the strōgest fortresse of all the countrey, and
the very key of Guyen, and chief chamber of Burdeaux: and for per
                     •
                  ormans
hereof, pledges wer deliuered, and writynges autentique sealed.
This agrement once blowen through the countrey, the citie of Burdeaux,
and al other tounes, (except Bayon) made like agrement, and deliuered
pledges. So did al the noble men and gētlemen, whiche wer subiectes
and vassals to the croune of Englande. Alacke alacke, euery daie
was lokyng for relief, and euery houre was gapyng for cōfort, but wisshyng
serued not, nor hopyng nothyng helped: for the pestiferous diuision,
whiche reigned in Englande, so 
                     •
                  ueglid the braines of the noble
men there, that the honor of the realme was clerely forgotten, &amp; nothing
yearthly, but their priuate phantasies looked on and remembred. Now
to conclude, the daie appoynted came, but succor loked for, came not: so
that all the tounes in Acquitayne (except Bayon) deliuered their keyes,
and became vassals to the Frenche nacion, yet the citezens of Burdeaux
hopyng of rescous, offered themselfes to fight with the Frenchmen, and
desired a daie of battaill to be appoynted, whiche request was to theim
graunted. But at the daie assigned, thei beyng in dispa
                     •
                  re of all refuge
and succor, rendered themselfes and the toune, to their aduersaries, their
lifes and goodes reserued, with licence and saf
                     •
                  conduyte to all persons
whiche would depart and saile into Englāde. When the cities and tounes
of Gascoyne wer set in good ordre, the Erle of Dumoys and Foys,

with greate preparacion of vitaill, municion and men, came before the
cite of Bayon, where with mynes and battery, thei so dismaied the fearful
inhabitantes, that neither the capitain nor the souldiors, could kepe
them from yeldyng: so by force thei deliuered the toune, and their capitain
as a prisoner, offred a great some of money for the safegard of their
lifes and goodes. Beside these agrementes taken with tounes, diuerse
noble men made seuerall composicions, as Gaston de Foys, Capdaw of
Buessz, whom kyng Henry the fifth, made erle of Longuile and knight
of the garter, whose auncestors wer euer true to Englād, whiche agreed
that he, and Ihon de Foys his sonne, whom kyng Henry the sixt, created
erle of Kendale, and made also knight of ye garter, should enioy all their
landes in Acquitayne, geuen to them by the kynges of Englande, or by
the Dukes of Acquitayn. And because their intent was still to serue the
Kyng of Englande, their souereigne Lorde, thei agreed, to deliuer into
the custody of therle of Foys, their cosyn, the sonne and heire of thesaied
erle of Kendale, beyng of the age of three yeres, to the intent, that if he at
his full age, denied to become subiect and vassaill to the Frenche kyng,
or before that tyme disceased, that then, after the death of his father and
graundfather, all thesaid landes should wholy remain, to the next heire
of their bloud, either male or female, beyng vnder the obeysance of the
Frenche kyng, or his heires. Many noble men, whose hartes were good
Englishe, made like composicions, and some came into Englande, and
other went to Caleis, and wer great officers there: as the Lorde Duras
whiche was Marshall there, and Monsire Uanclere, whiche was there
deputie, vnder therle of Warwick, (as after shalbe shewed.) Now haue
I declared to you, the losse of Fraunce, Normandy, &amp; Acquitayn: wherfore,
hauyng no more cause yet to speake of theim, I will returne to the
greate trouble, discencion and diuision, whiche long was cloked, &amp; now
openly set abrode, and burst out in the realme of Englande.
            
            
               ¶The .xxx. yere.
               
                  YOU haue heard before,The .xxx. yer
                        •
                     . how the duke of Yorke, as heire to
Lionell Duke of Clarence, pretended priuily, a title to the
Croune, and how his frendes commoned secretly, with diuerse
persones of that matter, and excited theim to set forward,
and auaunce that parte to the vttermoste: and howe
thesaied duke was sent into Ireland, where he was daily aduertised by
his assured frendes, of all thynges doen in Englande, and by thē knewe
in what estate he stode, bothe with the nobilitie, and cōmonaltie. Wherfore,
he mindyng no lēger to dreame in his waightie matter, nor to kepe
secrete his right and title, returned out of Irelande, and came to Londō
in the parliamēt tyme, where he deliberately consulted, with his especial
frendes: as Ihon Duke of Norffolke, Richard Erle of Salisbury, and
Lorde Richard his sonne, whiche after was Erle of Warwicke, Thomas
Courtney, erle of Deuonshire, and Edward Broke, lord Cobham
a man of a greate witte and muche experience: requiryng them, bothe of

aduise and counsaill, how he might without spot of treason, or colour of
vsurpacion, set furth his title, and obtein his right.
               
                  AFTER long consultacion, it was thought expedient, first to seke
some occasion and picke some querell, to the duke of Somerset, whiche
ruled the kyng, ordered the realme, and moste might do with the quene:
Whom, the commons, for the losse of Normandy, worse then a Tode or
Scorpion, hated, disdained and execrated, in so muche that diuerse euill
ruled persones, brake his house, &amp; spoyled his goodes, within the blacke
Friers of the citie of Londō: whiche malefactors, accordyng to their desertes,
wer iustly executed &amp; punished. For wel knewe the duke of Yorke
and his adherentes, that if the Duke of Somerset sawe or smelled, any
poynt of their purposed enterprise, that he would with speare and sheld,
with might and main, withstand and repell thesame, to thextreme point
of death, and to their vtter confusion. Wherfore to abbridge his power,
and to minishe his aucthoritie, thei determined to bryng hym, into the
hatred of the people, and into the disdain of the nobilitie. And to be the
stronger in the settyng furth of their feate, thei, what with rewardes and
faire promises, &amp; what with declaracion of great enormities, committed
by the kinges counsailors, gainst the common wealth, allected &amp; allured
to them, lu
                     •
                  ty bachelars, &amp; actiue persons, of a great numbre, protestyng
and declaring, that thei neither meant euil, nor thought harme, either to
the kinges person, or to his dignitie: but that their intent was, for the reuenging
of great iniuries doen to the publique wealth, and to persecute
and reforme diuerse rulers about the kyng, which daily cōtrary to right
and equitie, vexed &amp; pilled thenglish people, without reason or measure:
so ye no man was in suretie, either of his awne goodes, or suer of his proper
lādes or possessiōs. These great enormities, thei caused to be published,
to thintent ye their chief purpose should not be espied, or perceiued.
               
                  VVHEN the duke of Yorke had thus framed thentery into his lōg
intended iorney, he with helpe of his frendes, assembled a great army in
the Marches of Wales, publishyng openly, that the cause of his mociō
was for the publique wealth of the realme, and greate profite of the cō
                  mons:
whiche faire told tale, allured to hym muche people, aswell of the
chiualry as of the meane sort. The kyng muche astonnied with this sodain
commocion, by the aduise of his counsail, raised a great hoste, and
marched forward toward the duke: but he beyng of his approche, credibly
aduertised, by his espials, diuerted from the kynges waies, and toke
his iorney toward London: and hauyng knowledge, that he might not
be suffered with his army, to passe through London, he crossed ouer the
Thamese at Kyngston bridge, and so set furth toward Kent, where he
knewe that he had bothe frendes and good willers, and there, on brente
Heath, a mile from Dertford, and .x. miles from Londō, he embattailed
himself, and encamped his army very strongly, bothe with trenches and
artilery. The king being therof aduertised, with great diligēce, brought
his army to blacke Heath, &amp; there pight his tētes. While both tharmies

lay thus embattailed, the kyng by thaduise of his counsaill, sent the bishoppes
of Winchester and E
                     •
                  ie to the duke▪ bothe to knowe, what was
the cause of so greate a tumult and commocion, and also to make a concord,
if the requestes of the duke and his company, semed to them consonant
to reason, or profitable to the people. The duke hearyng ye message
of the two bishops, either doubtyng the variable chaunce of mortal battaill,
or lokyng for a better occasiō, or a more luckey daie, aunswered the
prelates, that his commyng was neither to dampnifie the kyng, neither
in honor, nor in persone, nor yet any good man, but his intent was to remoue
frō hym, certain euil disposed persons of his counsaill, whiche wer
the bludsuckers of the nobilitie, the pollers of the cleargie, and oppressors
of the poore people: emongest whō he chiefly named, Edmond duke
of Somerset, whom if the kyng would commit to warde, to aunswere to
suche articles, as against hym should in open parliament, be bothe proponed
and proued, he promised not onely to dissolue his army and dispatche
his people, but also offered hymself, like an obedient subiecte, to
come to the kynges presence, and to do hym true and faithful seruice, accordyng
to his truth &amp; boūden duetie. When the messengers wer returned
with this reasonable aunswere: The kyng perceiuyng, that without
great bludshed, he could not bridle the duke of Yorke, nor without war
he could not appeace, the furious rage of the cōmon people, beyng once
set on fire, except he folowed their mindes, and graūted their requestes,
caused the duke of Somerset, to be committed to ward, as some saie: or
to kepe hymself priuye in his awne house, as other write, till the fury of
the people were somewhat asswaged and pacified. Whiche thyng doen,
the duke of Yorke the firste daie of Marche, dissolued his army, &amp; brake
vp his campe, and came to the kynges tent, where beside his expectaciō,
and cōtrary to the promise made by the kyng, he found the duke of Somerset,
set at large and at libertie, whom the duke of Yorke boldly accused,
of treason, of bribery, oppression, and many other crimes. The duke
of Somerset not onely made aunswere to the dukes obieccions, but also
accused hym of high treasō, toward the kyng his souereigne lorde: affirming,
that he with his fautors and complices, had consulted together
how to obtein the croune and scepter of the realme. By meane of whiche
wordes, the kyng remoued straight to Lōdon, and the duke of Yorke as
a prisoner, rode before hym, &amp; so was kept a while. The kyng assembled
together a greate counsail at Westminster, to here the accusaciōs of the
ij. dukes, the one obiectyng to the other, facinorous actes, &amp; detestable
crimes. But the duke of Somerset, whiche now conceiued in his mynd
the thyng that shortely folowed, incessantly exhorted the counsaill, that
the Duke of Yorke, by compulsion, or otherwise, might bee compelled to
confesse his offence, and so beyng attainted of treason, to be put to execucion,
and his children to bee taken enemies and aduersaries to their natiue
countrey: to the intent that by the losse of this onely Prince and his
sequele, all ciuill warre, and inward diuision might cease and be repressed:

besechyng almightie God, that so greate an enemy to the kyng and
his bloud, might neuer escape punishment, nor continewe long in life.
The duke of Somerset set 
                     ••
                  rth this matter the more vehemently, because
he knew perfitely, that the duke of Yorke dayly studyed, howe to
get the crowne, and obteyn the gouernaunce, and to depose and destroy
both the kyng and hym. But the necessitie of destineye, can not by any
mans deuise, be either letted or interrupted: for many thynges (to common
iudgementes) declared the duke of Yorkes trought and innocēcye
in this case. First his free and voluntary coming to the kyng, when he
with his power was able to encoūter with the kynges puyssance, which
was an open token▪ and manifest argument, that he neither meāte treason,
nor yet fraude. Secondarily, his humble submission, his reasonable
requestes, and profitable peticions, for the pore commons, were iudged
no pointes of a man, that desired souereignetie, or rule aboue other
which thinges he did onely for a cautele, (as afterward openly appeared).
While the coūsail treated of sauing or losing of this dolorous duke
of Yorke, A rumour sprange throughout London, that Edward erle
of Marche, sonne and heyre apparaunt to the sayd duke, a yong prince
of great with and much stomacke, accompanied with a stronge armye of
Marchemen, was comyng toward London, which tidinges sore appalled
the Quene and the whole counsail. Beside this, thesame very daye
came Ambassadours from the heades and Magistrates of the citie of
Burdeaux, whereof the chefe were, the erle of Kendal, and the lord Lesparre,
which signified to the counsaill, that if thei woulde sende an armye
into Gascoyne, the Gascoyns wolde reuerte &amp; turne agayne to the
English part: aduertising them, that there was 
                     〈◊〉
                   those partes no puissaunce
or garrison of Frenche men, to withstand them, &amp; therefore there
was no doubte of the regay
                     •
                  ing or recōquest: requyring thē wt all diligēt
celeritie, to take so fayre a prey so opēly to them offered, &amp; to mynd
nothing before the regayning of so fruictful a countrey. These .ij. thinges
sore troubled the heades of the kinges counsaill, whiche, leste this
discencion betwene two persones, might be the let of outward conquest,
set the duke of Yorke at libertie, and permitted him to returne to his
fayre Castel of Wignore, in the Marches of Wales, where he studied,
both how to displease his enemies, &amp; to obteyn his purpose: And so by
meanes of ye absēce of ye duke of Yorke, which was in maner banished ye
court &amp; y• kinges presēce, ye duke of Somerset rose vp in high fauor wt
y• king &amp; ye quene, &amp; his worde only ruled, &amp; his voyce was only hearde.
            
            
               ¶The .xxxi. yere.
               
                  THe counsaill of Englande, not forgettinge the offer of the
Gascons,The .xxxi. yere. and that thei might now haue the citie of Burdeaux
with the coūtrey round about, by offer and request,
whiche with great charge &amp; longe warre, they coulde scant
agayn recouer or repossesse, appointed the veterane souldiour,
and valiaunt Capitayn, Ihon lord Talbot, and erle of Shrewsburye,

to be chefetayn of the armye, which should in all haste be transported
and conucyed into Acquitayn. The lordes of Gascoyn, both well
pleased and glad of their aunswere, returned into their countrey, in as
secret maner, as they from thense departed, declaringe to their nacion,
the Capitaines, &amp; the powre, that was to thē coming: exhorting euery
man to be firme and stable to the kyng of England and his heyrs, vnder
whose libertie and fredom, thei had prospered &amp; reioysed, aboue .iii.C.
yeres, rather then now to fal into the French captiuitie; whose taxes
were vnreasonable, and whose dayly exaccions were to them importable.
When the valiant Talbot, the hardy erle of Shrewsbury was appointed
to assemble an army of men, and them to cōuey into the duchie
of Acquitayn, Lord, how busy he was in mustering, howe diligēt in setting
forward, and how ientelly he entertayned his men of warre, as
though he went first to warre, and neuer had takē payne, either to serue
his price or to gayn honor. What should I speake, how that he thought
euery houre, as thre, till his armie were ready, or write, what payne he
toke to se them shipped and vitayled. But verely men iudge, that
as this labor was the ende and extreme point of all his worldly busynes
so he should shew him self: fearce, coragious, &amp; feareful to his enemies
in the extreme point of his death and naturall departing. Thys
English Hector &amp; marcial flower, elected to him, the most hardy &amp; coragious
persons, which he could espye, preparing also, horses, municions
vitayles, and all thinges necessarie to such an army, and to so great an
enterprise. Whē all thinges were shipped, and wynd and wether serued
he toke his chaunce, and sayled into Gascoyn, where without resistēce,
he peaceabl
                     •
                   arriued in ye Isle of Madre, where he reposed his army, beyng
scant .iij.M. men, and destroyed all the countrey, betwene Burdeaux
and Blay, and toke the strōg towne and castel of Fronsac, and diuers
other townes and fortresses. The inhabitaūtes of Burdeaux, hearing
of the erles Arriual, sent to him messengers in the darke night, thā
                  king
and congratulating him for his thither comming, and also requiryng
him to accelerate, and spede his iorney towarde their citie, enformyng
him, that now the time was propice for his purpose: and tyme
not taken, was labor mispent. This aunciēt Fox, and pollitique Capitayne
lost not one houre, nor spared one mynet, till he came before the
citie of Burdeaux. The citezens glad of his commynge, made not the
French capitayns, which had the gouernaunce of the towne, either parties
or priuies of their entent: yet some of them wolde, that the Frenchmen,
in securitie both of lifes and goodes, should departe out of y• town
but their will was no wil: for the multitude, abhorryng the French seruitude
and embracing the English libertie, which they and their aūcestors
of many yeres and tasted, opened one gate, and let in a great parte
of the Englishmen army. The French Capitaynes entending to escape
secretely, by a posterne, were slayne and taken by the lorde Lespar, and
other of the English army. After the regaynyng of Burdeaux, arriued

at Blay, the bastard of Somerset, syr Ihon Talbot, lord Lisle, by hys
wyfe sonne to the sayd erle of Shrewesbury, the lord Molyns, the lordes
Haryngton and Cameus, syr Ihon Haward, syr Ihon Montgomerye,
syr Ihon Uernon with .xxii.C. mē with vitailes and municiōs.
Whē the erle of Shrewesbury was thus accordyng to his entent of all
thinges furnished and adorned: firste he fortified Burdeaux with Englishmen
&amp; victayle: after that, he rode into the countrey abrode, where
he obteined cities, and gat townes without stroke or dēt of swourde▪ for
the poore and nedy people beyng fatigate, and wery with the oppressio
of their new landlordes rendered their townes before thei were of them
requyred, and beside this the townes &amp; cities farre distauncte frō Burdeaux
sent messengers to the erle, promisyng to him both seruice &amp; obeysaunce.
And emonge other the towne and castell of Chastillon in Perigotte,
was to him deliuered by the Frenchmen vpon cōposicion, that
they might with their lifes sauely departe: which town, the erle strōgly
fortified both with men and ordinaunce. The French kynge lyeng at
Towers in Towrayne, beyng of the erles actes in Gascoyn credible enformed,
was not a litle exasperate &amp; quickned: wherefore he mynding to
resist the first storme, and repulse the first surge, assembled a great army
to the number of .xxii.M. men, and enteringe into Acquitayne came
to Lusigneum, and from thence accompanyed with the erle of Ponthyure,
the lordes of sainct Seuere and Boucat, marched toward Caleys
in Gascoyn, and with fayre promises obteyned the town. And after that
towne gayned, the Frenche kynge diuided his army into two parties,
wherof the one was gouerned by the erle of Cleremont, sonne in law to
kyng Charles, and heyre to the duke of Burdon, in the which were .xv.M.
men, in whome consisted the wayght and peyse of the whole enterprise.
This army he appointed to take the next way toward Burdeaux:
the other army wherof he was Capitayn and leadar him self, accompaned
with the peres and noble men of his realme, he kept and reteyned
still beside Caleys, and sent the two Marshals of Fraūce with .xviii.C
men of armes, beside archers, to besege the towne of Chastylon in Perigot,
and in goyng thither, thei gat a fortresse, whiche they manned, and
so departed to Chastilone, which they enuyroned with a strong seage, &amp;
cast highe trenches, and made depe dytches on euery syde: and in a
place where their enemyes must come, thei layde ordinaunce both great
and small, wherof so great a number was neuer before sene in France.
The erle of Shrewesbury hearing of these newes, and perceiuing that
he must of necessitie encoūter, and fight with two armies, determined wt
him selfe, first to assay the least power and weeker puyssaunce: wherfore
without longer procrastinacion, he assembled togither .viii.C. horsemē,
wherof the lord Lis
                     •
                  e his sonne, the lord Molyns, the lord Cameus, syr
Edward Hull, syr Ihon Haward, &amp; syr Ihon Uernō were chefe, and so
marched forward toward Chastylon, appoyntyng .v.M. fote men vnder
the conduyte of the erle of Kendalle, and the lord Lespar to folowe

hym with all spede. In hys way he assauted y• Towre, which the Frēchmen
had taken, and by force entered, and slew all that he founde within
and by the way he met
                     •
                   .v.C. Frenchmen, goyng a forragyng, of whom
he slew the greatest parte, and chaced the other to the campe. The Frēch
men knowyng by these good rūners away of ye erles approchyng, with
al diligēce left the seage, and retired in good order, into the place which
they had trēched, dytched, and fortefied with ordenaunce. Thei within
the towne seyng the seage remoued, sent out woorde to the Englishmen
that the Frenchmen fledde. The coragious erle hearyng these newes &amp;
feryng, leste through long taryeng the byrdes might be flowen awaye,
not tarieng till his fo
                     •
                  emē were come, set forward, toward his enemies,
which were in mynd surely to haue fledde, as they confessed afterward,
if the feare of the French kynges rebuke, whiche was not farre of, had
not caused them to tarye, and yet in this army were present the Marshals
and great Master of France, the erle of Pōthyeure, the Senescal
of Poythiew, the lord Bessire, and many valeant Barons and Knightes.
When the Englishmen were come to the place where the Frenchmē
were encamped, in the which (as Eneas Siluius testifieth) were .iii.C.
peces of brasse, beside diuers other small peces, and subtill Engynes to
the Englishmen vnknowen, and nothing suspected, they lyghted al on
fote, the erle of Shrewesbury only except, which because of his age, rode
on a litle hakeney, and fought fiercely with the Frēchmē, &amp; gat thentre
of their campe, and by fyne force entered into thesame. This cōflicte
continued in doutfull iudgement of victory .ii. longe houres: durynge
which fight, the lordes of Montamban and Humadayre, with a great
companye of Frenchmen entered the battayle, and began a new felde, &amp;
sodaynly the Gonners perceiuynge the Englishmen to approche nere,
discharged their ordinaunce, and slew .iii.C. persons, nere to the erle,
who perceiuynge the imminent ieopardy, and subtile labirynth, in the
which he and hys people were enclosed and illaqueate, despicynge his
awne sauegarde, and desiryng the life of his entierly and welbeloued
sonne the lord Lisle, willed, aduertised, and counsailled hym to departe
out of the felde, and to saue hym selfe. But whē the sonne had aūswered
that it was neither honest nor natural for him, to leue his father in the
extreme ieopardye of his life, and that he woulde taste of that draught,
which his father and Parent should assay and begyn: The noble erle &amp;
comfortable capitayn sayd to him: Oh sonne sonne, I thy father, which
onely hath bene the terror and scourge of the Frēch people so many yeres,
which hath subuerted so many townes, and profligate and discomfited
so many of them in open battayle, and marcial conflict, neither cā
here dye, for the honor of my countrey, without great laude and perpetuall
fame, nor flye or departe without perpetuall shame and cōtinualle
infamy. But because this is thy first iourney and enterprise, neither thy
flyeng shall redounde to thy shame, nor thy death to thy glory: for as
hardy a man wisely flieth, as a temerarious person folishely abidethe,

therfore y• fleyng of me shalbe ye dishonor, not only of me &amp; my progenie,
but also a discomfiture of all my company: thy departure shall saue thy
lyfe, and make the able another tyme, if I be slayn to reuenge my death
and to do honor to thy Prince, and profyt to his Realme. But nature
so wrought in the sonne, that neither desire of lyfe, nor thought of securitie,
could withdraw or pluck him frō his natural father: Who cōsideryng
the constancy of his chyld, and the great daunger that they stode
in, comforted his souldiours, cheared his Capitayns, and valeaūtly set
on his enemies, and slew of them more in number then he had in his cō
                  pany.
But his enemies hauing a greater company of men, &amp; more abū
                  daunce
of ordinaunce then before had bene sene in a battayle, fyrst shot
him through the thyghe with a hādgōne, and slew his horse, &amp; cowardly
killed him, lyenge on the grounde, whome thei neuer durste loke in the
face, whyle he stode on his fete, and with him, there dyed manfully hys
sonne the lord Lis
                     •
                  e, his bastard sonne Henry Talbot, and syr Edward
Hull, elect to the noble order of the Gartier, and .xxx. valeant personages
of the English nacion, and the lord Molyns was there taken prysoner
with .lx. other. The residew of the Englishe people fled to Burdeaux
and other places, wherof in the flight, were slayne aboue a .M. persons.
At this battayl of Chastillon, fought the .xiij. day of Iulij, in this
yere, ended his lyfe Ihon lord Talbot, and of his progenie ye fyrst erle
of Shrewesbury, after that he with muche fame, more glory, and moste
victorie had for his prince and coūtrey, by the space of .xxiiij. yeres and
more, valeantly made warre, and serued the kyng in the partes beyond
the sea, whose corps was left on the ground, &amp; after was found by hys
frendes, &amp; cōueyed to Whitchurch in Shropshyre, where it is intumulate.
This man was to the French people, a very scorge and a daily terror,
in so much that as his person was fearfull, and terrible to his aduersaries
present: so his name and fame was spitefull and dreadfull to
the common people absent, in so muche that women in Fraunce to feare
their yong childrē, would crye, the Talbot commeth, the Talbot commeth.
After this discomfiture, diuers lordes fled to Burdeaux, but the
erle of Kendall, the lordes of Montferrant, of Rosayne, and of Dangladas,
entered into the Castel of Chastillon, which they by the space of .x.
dayes manfully defended, but in conclusion beyng desperate of all succors,
rēdered the fortresse, and came safe to Burdeaux. After this town
was yelded the townes of sainct Million, Bybourne &amp; all other, which
the erle of Shrewesbury had conquered, rendered thē selfes to the Frē
                  che
obeysaunce, Burdeaux onely except. The which citie beyng the last
refuge, and onely consolacion of the Englishe people in Gascoyne, the
French kyng in person with all his puissaunce, strōgly beseged &amp; dayly
assauted, in the which he more lost then gayned: beside this, the English
men issued out, and coragiously fought with their enemies: likewise did
the citizens, which lokyng for no fauor at the French kynges hand, because
of their late coniuracion againste him, manfully defended them

selfes, and sore noyed and hurt their enemies. But in conclusion bothe
garrisons and the inhabitātes, oppressed with much penurye &amp; extreme
tamyne were coacted to render the citie vpon reasonable condicions, to
them by the French kyng sent and oblated: the effect whereof was that
no offence, before tyme committed or done by any of the citezēs should
hereafter be imputed, or leyd to the charge of any of them. Also that all
Englishmen and Gascons myght safely departe into Englande or to
Caleys with al their substance, and that the lordes Lespar, Duras and
xxx. other, should neuer vpon payn of death be founde within any of the
French kinges dominions, which lord Lesparre after beyng taken, disguysed
in Gascoyn was made shorter by the hedde. When this composicion
was agreed and sealed, the Englishmen had their shippes and al
thinges necessarie for their iorney, to them deliuered, which, when wynd
and whether were to them propice and conuenient, were shortly transported
into Englād, in the moneth of October this present yere. Thus
was the duchye of Acquytayn, which had cōtynued in the English possession,
from the yere of our Lord .M.lv. which is .iii.C. &amp; od yeres, by ye
mariage of Alienor, doughter and heyr to William duke of Aequitayn
wyfe to kyng Henry the second, finally reduced, and brought agayne
to the French obedience and seruitude. The kepyng of which duchye
was neither costly nor troblesome to the realme of Englande, but both
pleasant and profitable: for by the soueraingtie of that countrey, yonge
gentelmen learned the experiēce of warre, and expert mē were promoted
to many riche offices, &amp; great, liuinges within thesame. For within that

shall heare: whose mother susteyned not a litle slaunder and obloquye
of the commō people, saiyng that the kyng was not able to get a chyld,
and that this was not his sonne, with many slaunderous woordes, to

the quenes dishonor, which here nede not to be rehersed. After the birthe
of this child,The Kynges two brethren created erles. the Kyng highly auaunced his twoo brethren, on his mothers

died without issue.
            
            
               ¶The .xxxii. yere.
               
                  WHen foren warre and outward battailes,The .xxxii. yere. were brought to
an ende and finall conclusion: domesticall discord and ciuill
discencion began again to renew and arise, within the
realme of Englande: for when the care of outward hostilitie
(whiche kept the myndes of the Princes in the realme
occupied, and in exercise) was taken awaye and vanished, desire of souereigntie,
and ambicion of preemine
                     •
                  ce, sodainly sprang out so farre, that
the whole Realme was diuided into twoo seuerall faccions, and priuate
partes. For kyng Henry, discended of the house of Lancastre, claymyng
the croune from kyng Henry the .iiii. his graund father, first aucthor of
this diuision: and Richard duke of Yorke, as heire to Lionell, the third
sonne to kyng Edward the third: wresteled for the game, and stroue for
the wager. By reason wherof, the nobles aswell as the common people,
were into partes diuided, to the destruccion of many a man, and to the
great ruyne and decay of this region. For while the one part studied to
vanquishe and suppresse the other, all commō wealth was set a side, and
iustice and equitie was clerely exiled. For the duke of Yorke, which sore
gaped and more thirsted for the superioritie and preeminence, studied,
diuised, and practised al waies &amp; meanes, by the whiche he might attein
to his pretēsed purpose, and long hoped desire. And emongest all imaginaciōs,
one semed moste necessary for his purpose, whiche yet again was
to stirre and prouoke the malice of all the people, against the Duke of
Somerset, who onely ruled the Kyng, and ordered all thynges at his
pleasure and will: Imaginyng, that he beyng made out of the waie, his
purpose should shortly come to a good conclusion. Wherfore, to the nobles
of the realme he complayned, lamented, and detested, the miserable
state and daily ruyne, of this noble countrey: notyng and affirmyng, the
Duke of Somerset, to be the very roote and cause of thesame, whom he
named and called, an vniust man, a mischeuous persone, a tyrannicall
gouernor, and a coueteous coūsailor: laiyng also great offences to kyng
Henry, saiyng, that he was a man, neither of wit nor stomacke, neither
mete to be a kyng, nor apt to gouerne a common wealth, and therefore it
was the duetie of the noble men, and great Princes, not onely to thinke
on this weightie matter, but spedely to prouide a remedy, and to set the
Realme in another staye. By whiche complaintes and perswasions, the
duke of Yorke, so altered the myndes of many persones of high estate,
that thei liked not the worlde, as it then wauered, nor approued thactes
of the kyng or his coūsail. And because, that ambicion and auarice, was
newly entered into their hartes, thei studied, sodainly to change al thynges,

and to turne the worlde vpsetdoune. When the duke sawe mēnes
appetites, and felt well their mindes, he chiefly enterteined two Richardes,
and bothe Neuelles, the one of Salisbury, the other of Warwicke
beyng erle, the first the father, the second the sonne. This erle of Salisbury,
was seconde sonne to Raufe Neuell, erle of Westmerlande, whose
doughter the duke of Yorke had maried, &amp; thesaid Richard was espoused
to Lady Alice, the only child and sole heire of Thomas Montacute
erle of Salisbury, slain at the siege of Orleaunce, (as before I haue declared)
of whiche woman he engēdered, Richard, Ihon, and George. Richarde
the eldest sonne espoused Anne, the suster and heire of the entire
bloud, to lorde Henry Beauchamp Erle, and after duke of Warwicke,
in whose right and title, he was created and named Erle of Warwicke,
and not by his awne progeny or parentage. This Richard was not
onely a man of maruelous qualities, and facundious facions, but also
from his youth, by a certain practise or naturall inclinacion, so set them
forward, with wittie and gentle demeanour, to all persones of high and
of lowe degre, that emong all sortes of people, he obteined greate loue,
muche fauor, and more credence: whiche thynges daily more increased,
by his abundant liberalitie, and plentifull house kepynge, then by his
riches, aucthoritie, or high parentage: by reason of whiche doynges, he
was in suche fauor and estimacion, emongest the common people, that
thei iudged hym able to do all thynges, and that without hym, nothyng
to be well doen. For which causes his aucthoritie, shortly so fast increased,
that whiche waie he bowed, that waie ranne the streame, and what
part he auaunced, that side gat the superioritie.
            
            
               ¶The .xxxiii. yere.
               
                  WHē the duke of Yorke had fastened his chaine,The .xxxiii. yere. betwene these
twoo strong and robustious pillers, he with his frendes, so
seriously wrought, and so pollitiquely handled his busines,
that the Duke of Somerset, was arrested in the Quenes
greate chamber, and sent to the toure of London, where he
without great solempnitie, kept a dol
                     •
                  full Christmas: against whom in
open parliament, wer laied diuerse and heinous articles of high treasō,
aswell for the losse of Normandy, as for the late mischance, whiche happened
in Guyen. The kyng at this time was sicke at Clarendon, and so
conueyed to London, by reason wherof, no finall determinacion proceded,
in this greate and waightie cause, but it was put in suspence, til the
next assemble of the high court of parliament. Duryng whiche tyme, the
kyng either of his awne mynde, or by the Quenes procurement, caused
the duke of Somerset, to be set at libertie: by whiche doyng, grew great
enuy and displeasure, betwene the king and diuerse of his lordes, and in
especiall betwene the duke of Yorke, and the kynges linage. And to aggrauate
more the malice newe begon, the Quene, whiche then ruled the
rost and bare the whole rule, caused the duke of Somerset, to bee preferred

to the capitainship of Calice, where with, not onely the commons
but also many of the nobilitie, wer greatly greued and offended, saiyng:
that he had lost Normādy, &amp; so would he do Calice. The duke of Yorke
and his adherentes perceiuyng, that neither exhortacion serued, nor accusemēt
preuailed against the duke of Somerset, determined to reuēge
their querell, and obtein their purpose, by open warre and marciall aduenture,
and no lenger to slepe, in so waightie a businesse. So he beyng
in the Marches of Wales, associate with his especiall frendes, the erles
of Salisbury and Warwicke, the lorde Cobhā, and other, assembled an
army, and gathered a greate power, and like warlike persones, marched
toward Londō. The Londoners, hearyng of so great a multitude, commyng
toward their citie, wer greatly astonnied and muche abashed: for
euery persone considered his awne part, that either with holdyng with
the one side, or beyng contrariant to the other, or medelyng with no part
he should incurre indignacion or displeasure. The king beyng credebly
informed, of the greate army commyng toward hym, assembled an host,
intendyng to mete with the duke in the Northe parte, because he had to
many frendes about the citie of London, and for that cause, with greate
spede and small lucke, he beyng accompanied, with the Dukes of Somerset,
and Buckyngham, therles of Stafford, Northumberlande, and
Wilshire, with the lorde Clifford, and diuerse other barōs, departed out
of Westminster, the .xx. daie of May, toward the tonne of S. Albons: of
whose doynges, the duke of Yorke being aduertised, by his espials, with
all his power costed the countreys, and came to thesame toune, the third
daie next ensuyng. The kyng hearyng of their approchyng, sent to hym
messengers, straightly chargyng and commaundyng hym, as an obedient
subiect, to kepe the peace, and not as an enemy to his naturall countrey,
to murdre and slay his awne countremen and propre naciō. While
kyng Henry, more desirous of peace then of warre, was sendyng furthe
his orators, at the one ende of the toune: the erle of Warwicke with the
Marchemen,The first ba

kynges foreward, and theim shortly dicomfited. Then came the duke of
Somerset, &amp; all the oth
                     •
                  r lordes with the kynges power, whiche fought
a sore and a cruell battaill, in the whiche, many a tall man lost his life:
but the duke of Yorke sent euer freshemen, to succor the wery, &amp; put new
men in the places of the hurt persons, by whiche onely pollicie, the kynges
armie was profligate and dispersed, &amp; all the chieftaines of the feld
almoste slain and brought to confusion. For there died vnder the signe
of the Castle, Edmond duke of Somerset, who long before was warned
to eschew all Castles, and beside hym, lay Henry the second erle of Northumberlande,
Hūfrey erle of Stafforde, sonne to the duke of Buckyngham,
Ihon lorde Clifford, and .viij.M. men and more. Humfrey duke
of Buckyngham, beyng wounded, &amp; Iames Butler erle of Wilshire &amp;
Ormond, seyng fortunes loweryng chaunce, left the kyng poste a lone &amp;
with a great numbre fled away. This was thend of the first battaill at

                  .

Albons, whiche was fought on the Thursdaie, before the feast of Pentecost,
beyng the .xxiij. daie of Maie. In this .xxxiij. yere of the Kynges
reigne, the bodies of the noble men, were buried in the Monastery, and
the meane people in other places. This Edmond duke of Somerset, left
behynde hym three sonnes, Henry, Edmonde, and Ihon, whiche to the
extremitie of death, toke part with the line of kyng Henry.
               
                  AFTER this victory obteined, by the Duke of Yorke and his compaignions,
he remembred, that often tymes he had declared and diuulged
abrode, the onely cause of his warre to be, for thauauncement of the
publique wealth, and to set the Realme in a more cōmodious estate, and
a better cōdicion. Wherfore, he vsyng all lenitie, mercy, and bounteousnes,
would not once touche or apprehend the body of kyng Henry, whō
he might bothe haue slain, &amp; vtterly destroyed, consideryng, that he had
hym in his ward and gouernaunce. But with greate honor and due reuerence,
conueyed hym to London, &amp; so to Westminster, to whiche place
was somoned and appoynted, a great assemble of the thre estates, commonly
called a Parliamēt, whiche began the .ix. day of Iuly, in the whiche
session, the Duke of Gloucester, was openly declared a true Prince,
bothe to the kyng &amp; the realme. Beside this, it was enacted, that no persone,
should either iudge or report, any poynt of vntruth, of the duke of
Yorke, the erles of Salisbury and Warwicke, for commyng in warlike
maner, against the kyng at. S. Albons, consideryng, that their attempt
and enterprise, was onely to se the kynges persone, in safegard and suer
kepyng, and to put and aliene from hym, the publique oppressors of the
common wealth: by whose misgouernaunce, his life might be in hasard,
and his aucthoritie hang in a very small thred. In whiche Parliament
also, the duke of Yorke was made protector of the Realme, and therle of
Salisbury, was appoynted to be Chauncellor, and had the greate seale
to hym deliuered: and the erle of Warwicke, was elected to the office of
the capitain of Calice, and the territories of thesame. As this deuise was
pollitiquely inuented, so was the sequele thereof to the firste aucthors,
bothe honorable and profitable, if fortunes ship had sailed al one way.
For by this practise, the whole rule and regiment of the whole Realme,
consisted onely in the heddes and orders, of the duke and the Chauncellor,
and all the Warlike affaires and businesse, rested principally in the
erle of Warwicke, and so emongest them, it was agreed, that kyng Henry
should still reigne, in name and dignitie, but neither in deede, nor in
aucthoritie: not myndyng either to depose or destroy thesaid kyng, least
thei might sodainly prouoke and stirre the fury and ire of the common
people against theim: whiche for his holines of life, and abundant clemencie,
was of the simple sort, muche fauored, and highly estemed. After
whiche aucthoritie geuen, these three persones ruled the realme, and did
all thynges after their awne discrecions, (whiche without battaill or
manslaughter, might haue easely depriued thesaied Kyng, bothe of life
and lande). And firste thei amoued from the priuie counsaill, all suche

yet in al their rule, I finde no mencion made, of differryng Iustice, or of
their pollyng, or their bribery, as was openly proued by such as gouerned
before their tyme: Sauyng that thei tooke out of the sainctuary of
Westminster, Ihon Holland, duke of Excester, beyng repugnant to the
ordre taken and concluded, in the last parliament, and conueyed hym to
Poumfret castle. Whiche takyng out, was accompted an execrable and
a dampnable offence, of diuerse of the spiritualtie, and especially of the
Abbot of Westminster and his Monkes, and this is the most spot that
was (as I could rede) euer moste to be caste in the Dukes fame, duryng
his Protectorship, or of his counsaill.

disdain of superioritie, whiche hath consumed the bloud of
so many noble princes, and destroyed the linage of so many
gouernors, in all Realmes and kyngdomes, as well pagan
as Christian, could not abstein frō incensyng the hartes
of lorde Hanry Beauford, newly come to the Duchy of
Somerset, by the death of duke Edmond his father, whiche at the battaill
of sainct Albons, (as you haue heard before rehersed) lost his life,
and of Humfrey duke of Buckyngham, (whose sonne and heire named
Humfrey, erle of Stafford, tasted thesame cuppe, at the forenamed conflict)
and of other lordes and mē of aucthoritie, fauoryng and folowyng
the part of kyng Henry, whiche not onely bewailed and had compassion
of the vnsure condicion, and waueryng estate of his rule and lordeship,
perceiuyng openly, wherunto the cloked gētlenes, and subornate fashiō
of the duke of Yorke, tended and crept vp: but also thought it necessarie
and conueniēt, to puruey for a remedy, or the mischief happened. Wherfore
with open mouthes and fierce corages, thei came to Quene Margaret,
informyng her, that it was not honorable, but a reproche and infamy
to the Kyng, to haue one to bee a Protector and gouernor of hym
and his Realme, as who would saie: that he was either a childe, whiche
had nede of norice, to fede him with pappe, or an innocent creature, whiche
muste be ruled by a tutor, asserteinyng her farther, that the Duke of
Yorkes only intent was, vnder the colour of this protectorship, sodainly
to destroy &amp; depose the kyng, when he least thought of it, and therfore
willed her in so quicke a mischief, to prouide a hasty remedy, if she loued
the safegard of her husbande, or the tuicion of her self. The Quene hauyng
a wit, more then the common sort of women haue, and consideryng
the estate of her husbande, the condicion of her self, and the perill of her
onely sonne, thought it necessary, to plucke the sword of aucthoritie, out

of their handes, whiche vnder colour of rulyng vnder others, desired to
be gouernors, and superiors theimselfes. Wherefore, a greate counsaill
was called at Grenewiche, where the duke of Yorke, was discharged of
his Protectorship, and the erle of Salisbury also, was dismissed of his
office: whiche malicious mutacion emongest the nobilitie, caused sodain
alteracions and sedicious commocions, to spryng and arise in the commonaltie,
and in especiall, within the citee of London.
               
                  FOR a young Marchaunt, whiche before tyme had been in diuerse
citees within the countrey of Italy, and there prohibited by the Magistrates

siue, chalenged an Italian in Chepe side, for wearyng of a dagger, confutyng
hym with the lawes of his awne countrey, whiche, like a Colericke
knaue and presumpteous persone, so disdainfully and with suche
taūtes and checkes, aunswered the marchant, that he not willing to suffre
to opē a reporche, in so publique a strete, and that of so proude a villain,
toke by force from him his dagger, and with thesame, a litle cut his
croune, and cracked his pate. This Italian in greate hast, complained
to the Mayer, of this offence, whiche at the nexte Courte, holden at the
Guyldhaule, by the consent of the whole senate, sent for thoffendor, and
declaryng to hym his crime, commaūded hym to ward, whereof diuerse
other light marchantes within the citee, sore abhorryng the Italian nacion,
for lickyng the fat from their beardes, and taking from them their
accustomed liuyng, by reason that thesaid estraūgers imported &amp; transported,
into and out of this realme, all suche marchandises, commodities,
and necessaries, as thenglishemen onely wer accustomed to do, assembled
together in greate plumpes, and by force compelled the Maire
to deliuer the prisoner out of newgate: and yet this multitude, with this
doyng nothing saciate nor appeased, like madde persons and frantique
fooles, ranne to the seuerall houses, of diuerse Uenecians, Lucases, and
Florentynes, and theim spoyled, robbed and riffled, without reason or
measure. The Maire perceiuyng this greate enormitie, assēbled a great
numbre of substanciall and graue citezens, whiche, not without greate
bloudshed, and maymyng of sundery persones, finally appeased their
rage, and caused the people to departe to their houses. The beginner of
this temerarious commocion, and sodain vprore, either perswaded by
his frendes, or fearyng his chaunce, whiche for his first facte might sodainly
insue, departed to Westminster, and there Registered hymself as
a sāctuary man. The Quene whiche ruled all thynges, hearyng of this
greate riote and vnlawfull misdemeanour, sent the Dukes of Excester
and Buckyngham, accompanied with many other noble men, to London,
with a commission of oyer and determiner, for the punishement of
this outragious offence &amp; sedicious crime. When the Maire of the citee
the two dukes, and the two chief iustices, wer set in the Guyldhaule for
the performance of their commission, &amp; began to call the empanelles, for

for y• late cōmitted robbery &amp; riot, as they were goynge to their
trial or arreigmēt. But this great tumult &amp; sodain fury, was by discrete
and sage citizens, a litle and litle appeased and finally quenched, but in
the meane season, the dukes and other commissioners, beynge vntrewly
aduertised, ye they were in ieopardy of their lifes, sodaynly departed frō
the Guyldhaule, and left their inquyrie for y• day. The Mayre on y• next
day perceiuyng how the grudge rose, called a common counsail, wherof
ye nūber was .j.C.iiij. score &amp; od persons, &amp; by auctoritie of thesame ordeyned,

the insolent people, after which appeasyng ye cōmissioners returned to y•

put to execucion, besyde diuers great fynes and raūsomes payd,

               ¶The .xxxv. yere.
               
                  THE French nacion, hearyng of this domesticall diuision
and ciuile dissencion,the .xxxv. yere. within the Realme of Englād, much
desyring to be reuenged of olde displeasures and great damages,
which they had so many yeares born and susteined
by the English people, appoynted two Nauyes to inuade
and depopulate the townes and portes, adioynyng to the ryuage of the
sea. The capitayn of ye one army, was Williā lord Pomiers, and of the
other, syr Piers Bressy, a great ruler in Normandy. These two Capitayns,
when opportunitie of wether serued, sett vp their sayles at the
mouthe of Sayme, and there seuered them selfs, the one Westward, and
the other Eastward, which was syr Peter de Bressy. This lusty Capitaī
saylyng all the cost of Susseix and Kent, durst not once take land, til he
arriued in the downes, and there hauyng by a certayn espial, perfit notice,
that the towne of Sandwyche was neither peopled nor fortefied,
because that a litle before, the chefe rulers of the towne were from thēce
departed, for to auoyde the pestilenciall plage, which sore there infected
and slew the people, entered the hauen, spoyled the towne, and after such
pore stuffe as he ther founde, ryfflyde and taken, he fearinge an assemble
of the cōtrey, shortly returned. The lord Pomiers likewise toke his
course Westward, and by night brēt certayn houses in founay, &amp; with a
litle pillage retired into Britayn. These two aduentures and fortunate

chaunces, which to them in cōparison of their great expēses, in their iorneys
were scant worthe one pore myte, or single farthyng: The Frenche
writers dylate, setfurth and paynt with pēne, as though they had gottē
Cresus riches, and Alexanders kyngdoms: forgettyng how many hundred
thousande poundes, they had lost in few yeres before precedynge,
as to all menne, beyng indifferent readers of this Historie, plainly appereth.
But verily some bread is better to the hungry person, then no
bread, and a smal gayn of him, which desireth recouerie, is a great pleasure,
and therfore the French aucthors make of a litle much, &amp; yet their
much (all thynges considered) is in effect nothyng at all. The Scottes
also not degeneratyng frō their olde mutabilitie, nor alteryng their aū
                  cient
condicions from their accustomed perfidie and vsuall vntreught
entered into Northūberland, kyng Iames the second, then beyng there
in person, and burned small houses, and litle cotages: but in the very
middes of their greate enterprise, they hearinge of the duke of Yorke,
marchyng toward thē, with a great army, with much payne, &amp; no gayn,
in all haste reuerred to their countrey. Let vs passe ouer for a tyme all
outward inuasions, and returne to our awn domestical debate, &amp; dayly
discord. First not forgettyng, that whyle forē enemies inuaded the outwarde
partes, and extreme confynes of this trobleous realme, a great
conflict was attempted betwene the lord Egremond, and the sonnes of
the erles of Salisbury: in the which fray, many persons were slayn, and
a greater number hurt. The lord Egremōd, in this great tumult could
not escape, but by force was taken and brought before the kynges coū
                  saill,
and there the kyng and the quene to shew them selfs to al persons
indifferent, adiudged him to pay to y• erle of Salysbury a great summe
of money, and for his heynous offence, done against the kynges lawes,
he was committed to the gayle of Newgate, within the citie of London
out of the which pryson, by helpe of his fautors, he secretly escaped, and
sodaynly departed, to the great vexacion of the shryfes of London, at y•
tune beyng. In which season, the craft of Printyng was first inuented
in the citie of Mens in Germanie,Whē &amp; where the moste excellente sciēce of Printinge was first inuented. to the great furtheraunce of all persons,
desiryng knowledge or thyrstyng for litterature. Quene Margarete,
whose breath ruled, and whose worde was obeyed aboue the kyng
and his counsail, within this Realme of Englande, entendyng the destruccion
of the duke of Yorke and his frendes, which deuise she thought
not mete to be practised nere to the citie of London, because she wel
perceyued the duke of Yorke to be had in more estimacion emonge the
citezens &amp; cōmunaltie, then the kyng her husbād or her awn person: caused
the kyng to make a progresse into Warwyckeshyre, for his health &amp;
recreacion, and so with Hawkyng and Huntynge came to the citie of
Couētrey, where were diuers ways studied priuely, to bryng the quene
to her hartes ease, and long expectate desire: which was the death &amp; destrucciō
of the duke of Yorke, the erles of Salesbury and Warwycke,
And for the furniture of this matter, al these .iii. noble mē were sent for

to Couētre, by the kynges letters vnder his priuie seale, to which place
the foresayd lordes, suspectyng no treason, nor puttyng diffidēce in any
creature, obediently resorted: but the serpent lurked vnder the grasse, &amp;
vnder sugered speache, was hide pestiferous poyson, so that if these noble
men admonished by their frendes, had not sodaynly departed, their
lyfes threde had bene broken, and their mortall fate had them ensued,
but by secrete admonicion of their good willers (to whome no earthly
treasure is comparable) they auoided this net, and narowly escaped the
snare, wherupon for the securitie and tuycion of their lifes, the duke of
Yorke departed to Wygnore, in the Marches of Wales, the erle of Salisbury
resorted to his fayre Castell of Middelham in the Northcouncrye,
and the erle of Warwyke sayled to the town of Caleys. Although
the bodyes of these noble personages, were by this sedicious and fraudulēt
meanes a sonder seperated as ye haue heard: yet their hartes were
knitte and coupled in one, neuer forgettyng, but dayly studyeng, bothe
how to be reuenged of the olde dispites and malicious attēptes, against
them committed and imagened, and also how to compasse their purposes,
and to get the superioritie and ouerhand aboue their euilwillers, &amp;
apparant enemies: for which causes, their letters neuer ceased, their messengers
neuer slept, nor their pursses were at no tyme shut, what for enentert
ayning of olde frendes, and obteyninge of new confederates, tyll
kyng Henry and his alyes were profligate, and expelled clerely out of
the Realme, as after shall appere.

declared his mynd and opinion in thesame: wherefore he was for this
cause abiured at Paules crosse, and all his bokes brent, and he him self
kept in his awne house, duryng his naturall lyfe. Some say that hys
opinion was, that spirituall persons, by Gods law, oughte to haue no
temporall possessiōs. Other writ that he saied, that personal tithes were
not dew by Gods law: but whatsoeuer the cause was, in such sort as before
I haue declared, he was vsed. Kyng Henry &amp; his adherentes, perceyuing
that the duke of Yorke lay still, and made no open apparance,
of assemble or commociō, returned to London, and there called a great
coūsaill, openly declaring, how the French kyng perceiuing the realme

discord was not afeard to sende his admirals on the costes of Kēt,
and Deuonshyre, and there to spoyle townes, burne houses, and murder
the English people: which cause also animated y• Scottes to make

Wherupō diuers graue and sad persons were sent to the duke of Yorke
and all other the great estates of the realme, which sins the battayle of
sainct Albons neuer met, came, nor cōmoned together, commaundynge
them for reasonable causes, and great consideracions, to resorte to the
kynges palayce, without procrastinaciō or delay. At this commaundement
came to London, Richard duke of Yorke, and Richarde, erle of
Salisbury, accōpanyed with a great number of meigniall seruaūtes &amp;
frendes, lest peraduenture they for lacke of ayde, myghte haue bene betrapped,

to London, the erle of Warwycke, whose seruituers were apparreled

to the citie, the Kyng, the Quene with all their familie, shortly folowed,
and were lodged in the Bishoppes palayce of London. These lordes
had such great companyes, attendyng on them (for one had .v.C. other

kept by the Mayre and senate of London, aswell by day as by nyghte,

likewise in the chapter house of Westminster. Thus euery part
both studied his awn profitte and aduaūcement, and also how to reuēg

his flāme, and as the course of water astricted &amp; letted
will flow and brust out in continuaunce of tyme: so thys
cācard crocodryle, and subtile serpēt, could not lōg lurke
in malicious hartes, nor venemous stomackes, but in cō
                  clusion
she must (according to her nature) appere &amp; shewe
her self. For after this apparant cōcord, and intrinsecall discord, accordyng
to the very nature of dissimulacion, diuers noble men of byrthe,
but not stable of worde, putting from them honor, trought and honestie
forgat their othe, and brake their promisse, &amp; aduaunced forth the banner
of displeasure, and the flagge of malice. So a man may set, hat such
persons, regard neither their awne peculiar profite, nor the publique
wealth of their natiue countrey, nor yet passe of an othe, or promise brekyng,
to whom discord is pleasant, and discension is delectable. For not
long after this dissimuled amitie, a certayn fray, either by chaunce, or of
a thyng prepensed, was made vpon a yoman of the erles of Warwyke,
by a seruiteur of the kynges, in the which the Assaylant was sore hurte,
but ye erles mā 
                  
                     •
                  led. The kynges meigniall seruaūtes, seyng their felow
hurt, and the offendor escaped, assembled in great number, and watched
the erle, returnyng from the counsaill toward his barge, and sodaynly
set on hym the yomen with swourdes, and the Blacke gard, with spittes
and fyre forkes. After lōg fight, and many of the erles men maymemed
and woūded, by helpe of his frendes, he toke a wherry, and so escaped to
London: whome the Quene incontinent commaunded to be apprehended,
&amp; as a captiue &amp; prisoner, to be sent to the Towre of Lōdō, where (if
he had bene then taken) he had shortly ended his dayes, and made hys
end. By this vnhappy fraye, and sodayn chaūche of malice, there arose
such dayly and 
                     •
                  errible warre, that euery man was in trouble, and no

person was in quiet. For after this displeasure doen to the erle, and the
quenes good mynd toward hym, by his secrete frendes priuely reueled,
he with all diligēce, toke his iorney to Warwicke, and after into Yorkeshire,
where he 
                     •
                  ounde the duke of Yorke, and the erle of Salisbury, declaryng
to them, the assaute of the kynges seruauntes, and the pretensed
purpose of the fraudulent Quene. After whiche complaint made, he fearyng
lest by long absence, he might be deposed or defrauded of his capitainship
of Calice, with greate spede embarked hymself, &amp; sailed thither,
daily expectyng and lokyng, what waie the duke of Yorke would take,
for acheuyng his long intēded purpose. After whose departure, the duke
of Yorke and therle of Salisbury, somwhat exasperate and moued with
this doble dealyng, began to grudge and murmure: affirmyng that in
the Quene rested nothyng, but fraude and femmyne malice▪ whiche rulyng
the kyng at her pleasure and wil, studied nothyng so muche, as the
destruccion of the nobilitie, and peeres of the realme. After long consultacion
had, it was agreed, that the erle with a warlike company, should
marche toward the kyng, and complain to him, bothe of the manifest iniury
doen to his sōne, and also of the vnkynd breach, of the sworne amitie
and late agremēt, in whiche suite, if he did preuail, he then should not
omit the occasion to hym geuen, in reuengyng the displeasures to hym
doen, by the quene and her sinister counsailors, whiche euill &amp; vngodly,
ordered the subiectes of the whole Realme. After this deuise made and
concluded, therle of Salisbury remoued from Middelham castle, accō
                  painied
with .iiii. or .v.M. men, and toke his waie through Lancashire,
and Shropshire, toward London. In the meane season the quene, whiche
was assisted and ruled, by the dukes of Somerset and Buckynghā
                  ▪
hauyng the vigilant iye and circumspect brayne, of a pollitique gouernor:
imagined that therle of Warwicke had kindeled this fire, and begon
this tumult, to thentent (accordyng to his pretensed purpose) to set
the duke of Yorke in the siege royall, and high throne of the realme: For
whiche causes, she beyng a woman of no smal wit, nor litle pollecie, conceiuyng
in her opinion, that it was no bote to make any farther concord
or league with her aduersaries, &amp; hearyng of therle of Salisburies setyng
forward, with acōpany of armed of men &amp; archers: assēbled together
a greate counsaill, to puruey a remedy, for that imminent mischief, and
(as in a multitude often times it happeth, so many heddes so many wittes)
so diuerse wer in opinion, that neither people nor weapon should be
stirred, till the erle approched: doubtyng, whether he came to demaunde
warre or peace, or to aske Iustice, &amp; reforme wrong. Other, otherwise
thought, and wer of a contrary opinion, makyng the foundaciō of their
argument, that the raisyng of people, and assemble of souldiors by hym,
could signifie no peace, nor treatie of concord: except a man should saie,
that intreatyng for fauor with naked sworde in hande, were in humble
submission and a meke request: whiche onely consideracion, moued them
to saie, y• as force with force, ought to be repelled, so he with a greate power,

or he came into the middest of the realme, should of necessitie be encountered
and (if fortune would serue) vtterly destroyed. This sentence
toke place, &amp; without delaie, sir Iames Twichet lorde Awdeley, because
his seignorie and power laie in those partes, where the erle should passe,
was appoynted to mete with hym, and to geue hym battaill, if he sawe
cause or place conuenient, and the quene folowed after. The lord Audeley,
accordyng to his commission, assembled aboue x.M. men, and knowyng
by his espials whiche waie therle kept, approched nere to hym on a
faire plain called Blore Heath, within a mile of the toune of Drayton,
in the countrey of Salope, commonly called Shropshire. The erle perceiuing
by the liuery of the souldiors, that he was circumuented and likely
to be trapped with the quenes power, determined rather there 
                     •
                  o abide
the aduenture, with fame and honor, then farther to flie, with losse &amp;
reproche: &amp; so encamped hymself all the night, on the side of a litle broke
not very brode, but somewhat depe. In the mornyng earely, beyng the
daie of .s. Tecle, he caused his souldiors to shote their flightes, towarde
the Lorde Awdeleyes company, whiche laie on the otherside of thesaied
water, and then he and all his company, made a signe of retraite. The
lorde Awdeley, remembryng not onely the trust that he was put in, but
also the Quenes terrible commaundement, (whiche was to bryng to
her presence, therle of Salisbury, quicke or ded) blewe vp his trumpet,
and did set furth his voward, &amp; sodainly passed the water. Therle of Salisbury,
whiche knewe the slaightes, stratagemes, and pollecies of warlike
affaires, sodainly returned, and shortly encountred with the Lorde
Awdeley and his chief Capitaines, or the residewe of his armie could
passe the water. The fight was sore and dreadfull. Therle desiryng the

                     •
                  auyng of his life, and his aduersaries couetyng his destruccion, fought
sore for the obteinyng of their purpose, but in conclusion, the erles army
as men desperate of aide and succor, so egerly fought, that thei slewe the
lorde Awdeley, and all his capitaines, and discomfited all the remnaunt
of his people. In this battail wer slain .xxiiii.C. persōs▪ but the greatest
plague lighted on the Chesshire men, because one halfe of the shire, was
one the one part, and the other, on the other part, of whiche numbre wer
sir Thomas Dutton, sir Ihon Dunne, &amp; sir Hugh Uenables. But therles
twoo sonnes, the one called sir Ihon Neuell, and the other sir Thomas,
wer sore woūded, whiche soberly iorniyng into the Northcountrey
thinkyng there to repose them selfes, wer in their iorney apprehēded, by
the quenes frendes, and conueyed to Chester: but their kepers deliuered
them shortly, or els the Marche men had destroyed the Gayles. Suche
fauor had the commons of Wales, to the duke of Yorkes band and his
affinitie, that thei could suffre no wrong to be doen, nor euil worde to be
spoken of hym or his frendes.
            
            
               ¶The .xxxviii. yere
               
                  
                  AFter this battail, the duke of Yorke not only perceiuing that the
destruccion of hym &amp; his frendes,The .xxxviii. yere. was intended (as by this last
conflict, was apparantly declared) but also remembryng, that all
his counsailes &amp; priuy intētes, wer now opened to the kyng and y• quene
whiche studied to diuert and turne from thē, all michief or infortunitie,
whiche might chaunce either to theim or their frendes, thought it mete
neither lenger to dissimule, nor farther to kepe his bill vnder wyng: and
therfore with a coragious harte, aswell for the obteinyng of the croune,
as for the tuiciō and safegard of hym and his frendes, he determined no
lenger to slepe in his den, but with all diligence, to set furthe his busines
and auaunce his banner. And therefore sendyng for therle of Salisbury
his felow and compere in all his doynges, counsailes, and fortunes (after
long communicacion had, of the Quenes misgouernaunce, and how
she without their assent, did all thynges at her will and pleasure) determined
to raise a greate army, and by fine force, either to die or win their
purpose. What should I saie, men were assembled, frendes wer sent for,
and a puissaunt armie was gathered, bothe of Northren men and Welshemen,
whiche in good ordre came into the Marches of Wales, adioynyng
to Shropshire, where thei determined either to abide their enemies,
or to mete them if thei marched forward. The king was not ignorant
of this assemble, nor yet vnaduertised of the dukes intēt: wherfore
to resist the mischief at the beginnyng, he caused commissiōs to be made
and sent into euery part of the realme, where he suspected either to haue
assured frendes, or indifferēt fauorers, for men and money. By reason of
whiche commaundemēt, a great numbre was assembled. Many for the
loue thei bare to the kyng, but more for the feare y• thei had of the quene,
whose countenaunce ws so fearfull, and whose looke was so terrible,
that to al men, against whom she toke a small displeasure, her frounyng
was their vndoyng, &amp; her indignacion, was their death. The king accō
                  panied
with the dukes of Somerset &amp; Excester, and other of the line of
Lancastre, determined clerely, to set ont he duke of Yorke &amp; his confederates,
and thē by force either vtterly to vanquish, or by pollecy to attrap
and bryng to confusion: wherupon in hope of good lucke, the kyng with
his army by long marchyng, came nere to the duke of Yorke, which was
strongly incamped, alitle from the toune of Ludlow, nere adioynyng to
the confines of Wales, to whom not long before, was come his trustie
frende Richard Erle of Warwicke, with a greate numbre of expert men
in marciall feates, whom he had brought with hym from Calice, wherof
twoo were menne of approued pollecye, in the warres of Normandy
and Guyen, the one called Andrew Trowlop, &amp; the other Ihō Blount.
These armies thus liyng, the one in the conspect and vewe of the other
studied all meanes and pollecies, how to take aduauntage eche of other
and how with lesse ieoperdye, the one might set on the other. The Duke
perceiuyng by reason of his experte Capitaines, a waye howe he might
easely dampnifie and discomfite his enemies, though no lenger to slepe

his purpose, but manfully to geue the onset, &amp; so with his secrete frendes
and capitaines, determined the next mornyng early, with dreadfull blastes
of the terrible trompet, to begin the battail, and set on the kyng and
his army, or he wer redy or in aray. But of this deuise succeded nothing
nor of this imaginacion proceded any effect. For Andrewe Trolop and
other the Calicians, whiche wer men of great knowledge and muche experiēce,
and had liued by the kynges wages, more then a few yeres, perceiuyng
now, that thei should fight against their souereigne lorde hymself
(whose frend thei estemed before that tyme, therle of Warwicke euer
to haue been taken and ruputed, and not his enemy or destroyer) in the
dedde of the night, before the daie of battaill, secretly departed from the
dukes campe, and submitted themselfes to the kyng, admonishyng hym
of all thynges prepared and deuised, for his losse &amp; destruccion. I
                     •
                   these
auncient capitaines wer welcome to the kyng, or if he ioyously them receiued,
I referre that to all men, whiche haue relief in their distresse, or
haua a sodain good chaunce, when thei thinke least vpon it. When the
duke of Yorke was aduertised of their departyng, no maruaill though
his senses wer moued, and his wittes disturbed, as a man that sodainly
riseth out of a traunse, woteth not what to do or sai
                     •
                  : For he first considered
the power and aucthoritie of the Kyng, and sawe that Andrewe
Troloppe, of his frend was sodainly transformed, into the image of his
extreme enemy, whose force and pollecie, asmuche now discōforted hym,
as by the truste whiche he put in hym, he was before incouraged: wherfore
he euidently perceiuyng, that all his counsaill and purpose, was by
the forenamed Andrew, reueled and disclosed, thought it better for hym
and his, to departe in suretie, them to abide the chaunce, of mutable Fortune,
whiche turneth the whiele at her wil &amp; pleasure: wherupon he with
his yonger sonne Edmond erle of Rutland, secretly departed into Wales,
and so passed into Ireland, where he was with al ioy &amp; honor gladly
receiued. Therle of March, sonne &amp; heire apparant to the forsaid duke,
accompanied with therles of Salisbury, and Warwicke, and sir Ihon
Wenlocke, stale away thesame night, &amp; came into Deuonshire: wher by
the meanes of Ihon Dinham Esquire (whiche after was high treasurer
of England, in the time of kyng Henry the vij.) thei bought a ship, whiche
cost C.x. markes, at Exmouth, &amp; sailed to Gernsay, and after cam to
Calice, &amp; wer let in at the posterne, &amp; ioyfully welcomed of their frendes.
               
                  THE next daie in the mornyng, the kyng beyng aduertised of the departyng
of the Duke of Yorke and his partakers, caused al his horssemen
to folowe theim by euery passage, but thei wer neither seen nor espied,
as thei that folowed, made reporte. The kyng perceiuyng that the
lordes were escaped, pardoned all the poore souldiours, sauyng certain
Ryng leaders, whereof some he punished and fined, and some he hanged
and quartered. After this, he remoued to Ludlowe, and there dispatched
his hoste, and spoyled the toune and the Castle, and sent the Duches
of Yorke, with her two yonger sonnes, to be kept in ward, with the

duches of Buckyngham her suster, where she continued a certain space▪
After this, he proclaimed these lordes, traytors to hym, enemies to their
countrey, and rebelles to the Croune: confiscatyng al their landes, goodes,
and offices, committyng the gouernaunce of the Northe partes, to
the Erle of Northumberlande, and the Lorde Clifford, as to his trustie
and moste faithfull frendes: and of his toune of Calice, he made Capitain,
Henry the newe Duke of Somerset: but the olde husbande man
saieth, that as to hastie sowyng, often time deceiueth, so to late, neuer wel
proueth. For in this businesse, protractyng of tyme onely, hurted and
harmed the Kyng and his sequele. For if he at the beginnyng, had dispossessed
his aduersaries of that refuge and holde, no doubte but he had
either tamed or vanquished theim, with litle labour and small daunger.
               
                  THE Duke of Somerset, reioysyng muche in his newe office, elected
diuerse hardy and valiaunt souldiours, and with greate pompe sailed
toward Calice: and when he thought surely to haue entered into the
Hauen, the artillarie shot so fiersely, bothe out of the toune and Risebancke,
that he sufferyng there a sore repulse, was 
                     •
                  ain to land at whitsandbay,
and sent woorde to the capitaines of the toune, to receiue hym,
as the Kynges lieuetenaunt, and shewed to them his letters Patentes,
but neither he nor his writyng, 
                     •
                  was once regarded or looked on: so of
necessitie he resorted to the Castle of Guysnes, daily skirmishyng with
the garrison of Calice, more to his losse then gain. After his arriuall, as
is aforesaied, diuerse of the mariners, owyng more good will, to therle
of Warwicke, then to this young duke, conueyed their shippes into the
Hauen of Calice, and in theim diuerse of the Erle of Warwickes enemies,
as Ianyn Fendill, Ihon Felowe, and diuerse other, and presented
theim to thesaied Erle, whiche incontinent, caused their heddes to bee
striken of. This daily conflicte, still continuyng betwene the Lordes,
whiche soiorned at Calice, and the Duke of Somerset, liyng at Guysnes,
no small numbre of the commonaltie, daily resorted to the Erle of
Marche and his confederates: by reason whereof, all though thei daily
lost people, and had many slain, yet their numbre was restored, and the
gappe euer filled, whiche was the continuall losse, and daily detriment
to the Duke of Somerset. Yet he like a valiaunt Prince, nothyng lesse
myndyng, then for lacke of ayde to be expelled from the great office and
renoumed aucthoritie, whiche the kyng had to hym geuen, in the partes
beyonde the sea, sent letters to the kyng, and messengers to the Quene,
desiryng of them aide and succor, in defence of the querell, and lawfull
assistence. His postes were not vnheard, nor his requestes vnprouided.
For without delay Richard lorde Riuers, &amp; sir Anthony Wooduile, his
valiaunt sonne, whiche after was Lorde Scales, accompanied with
foure hundred warlike persones, were appoynted to passe the seas, and
to be coadiutors to the Duke of Somerset. These marciall capitaynes
endeuouryng theim selfes to the poynt, for the whiche thei wer assigned,
came to the Porte of Sandwyche, and there abode the Wynde and the

wether, whiche obeyeth neither Kyng, nor serueth Emperoure.
               
                  THE Erles of Marche and Warwicke, and other beyng at Calice,
had knowledge of all these doynges, and secrete conuenticles: wherfore
to anticipate and preuent the Dukes purpose, thei sent Ihon Dinham
the valiaunt esquire, with a small numbre of men, but with a multitude
of couragious hartes, to the toune of Sandwyche, whiche sodainly entered
thesame, and tooke the Lorde Riuers in his bedde, and his sonne
also: robbyng houses, &amp; spoylyng shippes of great riches and marchandise,
and beside this, thei tooke the principall shippes, of the kynges nauie,
then liyng at the Port, well furnished with ordinaunce and artillarie,
but not without the fauour of the mariners, whiche fauoured more
the one part then the other. But although Ihon Dinham, Capitain on
the Lordes parte, was sore hurte and maymed on his legge, by reason
wherof, he euer after halted and somewhat limped: yet his courage and
pollecy was so much, that he vanquished his enemies, and brought the
shippes royall laded with preye and prisoners, to the toune of Calice,
and theim presented to the Erle of Marche, not knowyng then, that the
Lorde Riuers doughter should bee the Erles wife, whiche then had an
husbande leuyng, nor thinkyng that her father for her sake, should after
be destroyed. But who can knowe the secretes of GOD, or without
hym, declare the chaunce that after shall insue.
               
                  AFTER this bootie gotten, and good lucke obteined, diuerse of the
beste shippes, taken in the Hauen of Sandwiche, wer well vitailed and
manned, and with theim the Erle of Warwicke, transfreted and sayled
into Irelande, to common with the Duke of Yorke, of his greate affayres
and businesse. The wether was so faire, and the Wynd so fauorable
to the Erles purpose, that within lesse then .xxx. daies, he passed and repassed
from Calice to Deuelyne, and asserteined the Erles of Marche
and of Salisbury, what was the Duke of Yorkes deuise and intent,
bothe for his entre and theirs, into the Realme of Englande. The erle
of Warwicke had come to short home, to tel these tidynges, if the duke
of Excester, whiche, beyng Admirall of the sea, laye in the Weste countrey,
to stoppe the Erles passage, might haue had his awne will: but the
capitaines of his Nauy murmured against hym, and the mariners dispraised
and disdayned hym, gladde to heare of the Erle of Warwickes
good successe, by whiche occasion, he neither would nor durst one medle
or coupe with the Erles nauie.
               
                  DVRYNG this tyme, the Kyng called a Parliament, in the Citee
of Couentre, in the whiche, the Duke of Yorke and all his confederates
were attaynted of high treason, and their goodes and landes confiscat
and forfeted: and to prohibite their landyng in all partes, hauen tounes
were watched, and the sea costes were garnished with bekens. And sir
Simon Mondford with a great crew, was appoynted to kepe the dounes,
and the fiue Portes, and all menne passyng into Flaunders, were
vpon payne of death, prohibited to passe by Calice, lest the lordes there,

should borow of them any money, as they did prest of the marchantes
of the staple .xviii.M.
                     •
                  . late before, which was a great displeasure to ye
kyng, &amp; a more carasey to the quene. The lordes lyēg at Caleys, wer not
ignorant of all these doynges &amp; prouisions, but dayly were asserteyned
what was done in the kynges priuie chamber: wherfore firste they sent
a company to Sandwyche, which conquered the towne, and apprehended
syr Symon Moūtford, and brought him with all his mates to the
hauen of Caleys, where incontinēt, he with .xii. of his chefe felowes, lost
their heddes on the sandes, before Rysebanke. After the kynges nauye
gayned, and his capitayns on the arriual of the sea takē and destroied,
the lordes, lyenge at Caleys, hoping in their frendes within the realme
determined to passe the sea, and to land in England. And after thei had
put the castel and towne of Caleys, in sure and safe custodye to their
onely vse, they passed the sea, and landed at Sandwych. And so passyng
through Kent, there came to them the lord Cobham, Ihon Guldefford,
William Peche, Robert Horne, and many other gentelmen, which conueyed
them to the citie of London. But the fame of their landyng once
knowen, gentelmen repaired, and yomē resorted out of all the Southpartes
of the Realme: vpon which rumor, Thomas lord Scales, a man
in great fauour, with the kyng and Quene, accompanyed with the erle
of Kendale, a Gascoyn, and the lord Louel, resorted to London, with a
great company of armed men: declaring to the Mayre of the citie, that
their repayre onely was to defend, and kepe the citie from the spoyle &amp;
robbery of such traytors, as the kyng was crediblie enformed, woulde
thither make accesse: to whom the Mayre aunswered, that he wel knew
both his awne othe, and bounden duety toward his souereign lord and
prince, and neded neither of prompter, nor yet of Coadiutor, either to defend
or gouerne the citie, to him cōmitted in charge. With which aunswere,
the lord Scales and his associates not a litle displeased, entered
into the Towre of London, dayly with new inuentions, doyng displeasures
and domages to the citezens of the citie, whome they sore suspected,
rather to fauour then to hate, the erles of Marche, &amp; Warwycke, &amp;
other of their band and affinitie. Whiche erles with a great army came
shortly to London, and were of the Mayre and citezens ioyously receyued,
to whome resorted the Archebishop of Canterbury, the Bishops of
London, Ely and Excester, with many prelates and religious persons.
These lordes nothyng slackyng the purpose, that they came for, dayly
consulted and assembled together in the house of the friers Franciscane
within the citie. And after longe debatinge, and secrete consultacion
hadde, it was agreed, that they with their whoole puy
                     •
                  sa

his counsaill was dissolued, the erles of March and Warwycke, Thomas
lord Faucōbridge, Hēry lord Borchier, called erle of Eue, with a great
number of men, which came out of Kent, Essex, Surrey, and Sussex, to

the number as some writers afferme of .xxv.M. persons departed from
London, toward the kyng, lyeng at Couentre, then called the Quenes
secret arbor, leuyng behynd them, to kepe the Londoners in their fidelitie,
from reuertyng from their parte, the erle of Salisbury, the lord Cobham,
and syr Ihon Wenlocke: which lord Cobhā
                  ▪ with certayn Aldermen
of the citie, so kept the West side agaynst the Towre, and syr Ihon
Wenlocke, with other so vigilantly watched the East parte, towarde
sainct Katherynes, that no person either could issue out, or entre in, to y•
great displeasure of the lord Scales and his company, whiche dayly
shote their ordenaunce out, and had likewise great ordinaunce shott at
them, to the hurt, and no pleasure of both partes. The kyng not ignorāt
of all these doynges, assembled a great army, and accompanied with the
duke of Somerset, which was lately come from Guysnes, and the duke
of Buckyngham, and diuers other great lordes of his parte and facciō
came to the towne of Northampton, where the Quene encouraged her
frendes, and promised great rewardes to her helpers: for the kyng studied
nothing but of peace, quyet and solitarie life. When ye kinges host
was assembled, and that the Quene perceyued that her power was able
to matche with the force of her aduersaries, she caused her army to issue
out of the towne, and to passe the ryuer of Nene, and there in the newe
felde, betwene Harsyngton and Sandifford, the Capitaynes strongely
emparked them selfes with high bankes and depe trenches. The erle of
Marche beyng lusty, and in the floure of his coragious yought, lyenge
betwene Towceter and Northampton, determined to set on the kynges
army, without longer protractyng of tyme. And in the nighte season remoued
his campe toward Northampton, and in marchyng forward set
hys men in good order of battayl, wherof the vawegard was cōducted
by the erle of Warwycke, which, either by strenght or stealth maugre y•
lord Beamond, which kept a strayt, goyng toward the Kynges campe,
entered freshly, and began the battayle aboute .vij. of the clocke, the .ix.
daye of Iulij. After whome folowed the erle of Marche, with the bāner
of his father. This fight contynued in doutfull iudgemente, till the
houre of nyne, at which tyme the kynges army was profligat, and discomfited,
and of thesame slayn, and drouned in the ryuer, few lesse then
x.M. talle Englishmē, &amp; y• kyng hym self left alone disconsolate, was taken
and apprehended, as a man borne, and predestinate to troble misery
and calamitie. At this battayl were slayn, Humfrey duke of Buckyngham,
Ihon Talbot erle of Shrewesbury, a valeant person, and not de
generating frō his noble parent: Thomas lord Egremond, Ihon viscont
Beaumond, and syr William Lucy, which made great hast to come
to parte of the fight, and at his first approche was strikē in the hed
 wt an axe. Diuers other gētilmē were slayn in this ciuile battail, whose
names were not remembred nor published by any aucthor that I haue
redde. Beside these dead persons, many were taken prisoners, because
they left their horses, &amp; discēded to fight on fote. The duke of Somerset

and other, which narowly escaped, fled with the Quene and prince Edward,
into the Bishoprycke of Durhame, in whiche place they determined
to congregate, and gather a new armye and power, and if no hoope
were of recouery, them they agreed to flye into Scotland: there to expect
better lucke, and happier chaunce, by fortunes fauour. The erles beyng
victorious in this blody battayle, conueyed the Kyng that night again
to the towne of Northampton, and the next day with great solempnitie
and small comfort, they set forward the king, &amp; by easy iorneys brought
him to London the .xvi. day of Iulij, where he was fayntly receyue

febly welcomed, and was lodged in the Bishops palace. After whose
commyng to the citie, the Towre of London was deliuered to the erle
of Marche, vpon a certayn composicion. But the lord Scales, suspectyng
the sequele of the deliuery of thesame, toke a wherry priuily, entendyng
to haue fled to the Quene. But he was espyed by diuers watermē
belongyng to the erle of Warwycke, whiche wayted for his forthcommyng
on the Thamse, and sodaynly takē, and shortly slayne with many
dartes and daggers, and his body left all blody and naked at the gate
of the Clyncke, which after was buried in the church adioynyng. Then
were diuers persons apprehended, and endited of treason, whero
                     •
                   some

apperteineth, not as he, which requireth of you fauor, parcialitie, or bearyng,

Derby, duke of Lancaster and Herdford, sonne to Ihon duke of Lancaster,

begotten sonne of the sayd kyng Edward, by force &amp; violence, contrary
both to the duety of his allegiaūce, and also to his homage, to him both
done and sworne, raysed warre and battayle, at the caste of Flynt, in
Northwales, agaynst the sayd kyng Richard, and him apprehended &amp;
imprisoned within the Towre of Lōdō. Duryng whose life &amp; captiuitie

he wrongfully vsurped and entruded vpon the royall power and high
estate of this Realme and region, takyng on him ye name, stile, &amp; aucthoritie
of kyng and gouernor of thesame. And not therewith satisfied and
contented, compassed and accomplished, the death &amp; destruccion of hys
naturall prince, and most worthy souereigne lord, not as a common homicyde,
and bocherly murder, but as a regicide &amp; destroyer of his kyng.
After whose piteous death, and execrable murder (alas my harte pantethe
to remember the abhominable facte) the right &amp; title of the croune,
and superiorite of this Realme, was lawfully reuerted and returned to
Rogier Mortimer, erle of Marche, sonne and heyre to lady Philippe,
the onely chyld of the aboue rehersed Lyonel, duke of Clarēce, to which
Rogiers doughter called Anne, my most derest and welbeloued mother,
I am the very trew and lyneall heyre, which discent, all you can not iustely
agayn say, nor yet truly deny. Then remember this, if the title be
myne, why am I put from it: if I be trew heyre to the croune (as I am
in dede) why is my right withholden: if my clayme be good, why haue I
not iustice: for surely lerned men of great science and litterature, saye &amp;
affirme, that lyneall discent, nor vsurped possession, can nothynge preuayle,
if continuall clayme be lawfully made, or openly published. For
auoyding of which scruple and ambiguitie: Edmond erle of Marche,
my most welbeloued vncle, in the tyme of the firste vsurpar, in dede, but
not by right, called kyng Hēry the .iiij. by his cosyns, the erle of Northhumberlād,
and the lord Percy, he beyng then in captiuitie, with Owen
glendore, the rebell in Wales, made his title, and righteous clayme, to
the destruccion of both the noble persons. Likewise my most derest lord
&amp; father, so farre setfurth that right and title, that he loste his life, and
worldly ioy, at the towne of Southampton, more by power, then indifferent
iustice. Sythe whose death, I commyng to my full age, haue neuer
desisted to pursew my title, and requyre my right, which by meanes
of synister counsaill, and iniust detencion, I can neither obteyne or recouer.
So that of fyne force, I am compelled to vse power in stede of
prayer, &amp; force, in stede of request (not as I sayde before) for my priuate
emolumēt, and peculiar profite, but to restore peace, loue, and quietnes
to this our naturall regiō: which euer sythe the fyrste vngodly vsurpacion
of the forenamed Henry, vntruely called kyng Henry the .iiij. hath
ben clerely banished, and out of thesame iniustly exiled. What murders
and manslaughtes hath bene perpetrated, and committed within thys
countrey, sythe the beginnyng of that vngracious vsurpacion: what
number of noble men haue ben slayne, destroyed and executed, sith that
vnfortunate day: what manyfest iniquitie hath ben openly borne, and
maynteyned in euery countrey and citie, sith the dolefull death of kyng
Richard: or what person darre sue for his right at this dai, cōtrary to y•
will of the counsailors, which now beare the swyng and rule the roste.
Wel, wel, although almighty God slackely &amp; slowely do y• procede, to y•
punishment of synners: yet the differryng of his scorge, is recompensed

with ye greater payn, when his rod striketh, yea, and oftentymes he leaueth
the very malefactors, apparantly vnpunished, and scorgeth their
bloud, and punisheth thē in their heyres, by worldly aduersitie. Suche
is his mercy when it pleaseth him to shew it, and so sharpe is his whyp
when he lyst to strike. For although, Henry of Lancaster, erle of Derby
toke vpon him the scepter, and the croune, and wrongfully bare the name
and stile of a king, and was not much tyckeled with myne Uncle, the
erle of Marche, at yt time beyng within age: Yet was he neuer in suerty
of him self, nor had any, or enioyed any perfyt quietnes, either in mynd
or in body: for surely a corrupte conscience feleth neuer reste, but loketh
when the swourd of vengeaunce will discend and stryke. His sonne also
called kyng Henry the .v. obteyned notable victories, and immortall
prayses, for his noble actes, done in the realme of Fraunce: yet God for
the offence of his vntrew parente, sodaynly touched him, vnbodiynge
his soule, in the flower of his yought, and in the glory of his conquest.
And although, he had a fayre sonne, and a yong apparāt heyre: yet was
this Orphan such a one, as Preachers say, that god threatened to send
for a punishmēt, to his vnruely and vngracious people: saiyng by hys
prophet Esay: I shal gyue you chyldren to be your princes, and enfantes
without wysedom, shall haue the gouernaunce of you. The Prophet
lyed not, if you note all thinges in an order: For after this Henry y•
v. (whose fame, no mā can iustly reproue or deface) succeded his sonne
whome all we haue called our natural prince, &amp; obeyed, as his heyre: in
whose tyme, and wrongfull reigne, I require you diligently to cōsider,
with what great tormentes &amp; affliccions God hath whypped &amp; scorged
this miserable Isle, yea, with such and so many scourges and plagues,
as no nacion (the Egyptians onely except) were euer tormented, or afflicted
withall. I will not speake of rebellious murders and oppressiōs,
which of late had ben done, and exercised here emong vs: but I will declare
and manifest to you, how the croune and glorie of this realme, is
by the negligence of this silly man, and his vnwise counsaill, minished,
defaced, and dishonored. Is not Normandy, whiche his father gat, regayned,
and conquered agayn, by the insolencie of him, and his coueteous
counsail? Is not the whole duchye of Acquitayn by .ii.C. and od
yeres, peaceable possessed by the kynges of this realme, in one yere and
a litle more, gotten out of ower handes and seignorie? What should I
speake of Angeow and mayne or the losse, of the Isle of Fraūce, with the
riche citie of Parys. Alas, my hart sobbeth, myne eyes water, and my
toungue foltereth, either to speake or thinke of the losses and misfortunes,
that this our natiue coūtrey, hath of late susteined. But as Preachers
say: euill gotten gooddes, do not long continue, nor vsurped power,
hath no prosperous successe. I will not molest you, with the rehersyng
of the calamitie, whiche fell emōgest the Israelites, when Athalia
slew all the bloud Royal, except litle Ioas, and tyrānously vsurped the
croune: nor troble you with the cōtinual warre, which happened emōge

the Romaines, when Iulius Cesar toke vpon hym, without lawe or aucthoritie,
the name and stile of Emperor: but I put you in remembrance
of our awne nacion, what mischiefe, strife and misery succeded in this
realme, by the iniurious vsurpacions, of Herrald sonne to Godwyn erle
of Kent, and Stephē of Bloys, erle of Bulleyn, the one beyng the cause
of the conquest of this realme, and the other the occasion of infinite trobles,
and domesticall discencion within thesame: yet all these vexacions
and scorges, be but a shadowe or counterfeit light, in comparison of the
great calamities and miseries, whiche all we here present, haue seen and
experimented. Yet in the middes of this afflicciō, and to make an end of
thesame, God of his ineffable goodnes, lookyng on this countrey, with
his iyes of pitie, and aspect of mercie, hath sent me in the truth, to restore
again this decayed kyngdō, to his auncient fame &amp; old renoume. Whiche
here in open parliament, accordyng to my iust and true title, I haue
and do take possession, of this royall throne, not puttyng diffidence, but
firme hope in Gods grace, that by his diuine ayde, and the assistence of
you, the peeres of this Realme, I shall decore and maintein thesame, to
the glory of hym, honor of my bloud, and to the publique wealth, aswell
of you all here present, as of all the poore commons and subiectes, of
this kyngdom and regiment.
               
                When the duke had thus ended his oracion,
the lordes sat still like Images grauen in the wall or dōme Gods,
neither whisperyng nor spekyng, as though their mouthes had been sowed
vp. The duke perceiuyng none aunswer, to be made to his declared
purpose, not well content with their sobre silence, and taciturnitie, aduised
them well, to digest and pondre the effect of his oracion and saiyng,
and so neither fully displeased, nor all pleased, departed to his lodgyng
in the Kynges palace.
               
                  VVHILE he was thus declaryng his title, in the chambre of the peres,
there happened a straunge chaunce, in the very same tyme, emongest
the cōmons in the nether house, then there assembled: for a Croune whiche
did hang in the middell of thesame, to garnishe a branche, to set lightes
vpon, without touche of any creature, or rigor of wynd, sodainly fell
doune, and at thesame tyme also, fell doune the Croune, whiche stode on
the top of the Castle of Douer: as a signe and prognosticacion, that the
Croune of the Realme should bee diuided and changed, from one line to
another. This was the iudgement of the cōmon people, whiche wer neither
of Gods priuitie, nor yet of his priuie counsaill, and yet thei wil say
their opinions, whosoeuer saie nay.
               
                  THE lordes of the realme, forgat not the dukes demaunde, nor long
protracted the tyme, to se some good ende, in so waightie a cause: wherefore
diuerse lordes, aswell spiritual as temporall, with many graue and
sage persones of the commonaltie, daily assembled at the Blacke Friers
and other places, to treate and common of this matter, beyng of no smal
importaunce. Duryng whiche tyme, the Duke of Yorke, although he
and the kyng, wer both lodged in the palace of Westminster, yet for no

praier or intercession, he would once visite or se the kyng, till some perfit
conclusion wer taken, in this greate and waightie purpose: saiyng and
affirmyng, that he was subiect to no man, but onely to God, and he was
his lord and superior, and none other. I wil alitle space leue the lordes
consultyng together, and speake of outward attemptes &amp; foren doynges
               
                  THIS ciuill discension within the realme of Englande, did muche
animate and incorage Iames the secōd of that name, kyng of Scottes
to make warre on the Englishe nacion, partly for the displeasure which
he conceiued, for the death of Edmond duke of Somerset, his mothers
brother, and partly to shew hymself emōgest his people, to be bothe valiaunt
and coragious. This kyng Iames from his 
                     •
                  irste rule, began to
entre into suspicion with William Erle Douglas, a man both of great
kynne and more power, euer mistrustyng, that he nothyng more desired,
then to depriue hym from his aucthoritie, and to vsurpe thesame. This
cancard suspicion was so rooted in the kynges harte, that sodainly it
branched out, in so muche that the Kyng sendyng for the Erle, (whiche
trustyng on his awne innocencie, humbly came to his pres
                     •
                  nce) caused
hym shamefully to be slain and murdered with whiche iniury, his twoo
brethren, Archibald Erle of Murrey, and Hugh Erle of Ormount, not

                     •
                  ,
beeyng all of one line and surname, made open warre on thesaied
kyng Iames: but inconclusiō he preuailed, and suppressed the great power
of the Douglasses. And then thynkyng hymself a kyng, without either
peere or fere, assembled a greate army, and entered into the Marches
of Northumberlande, and besieged the Castle of Roxborough, and
there caused his newe Bombarde, lately cast in Flaunders, called the lion
and diuerse other peces, to be shot against the Castle, wherof one beyng
weake and slender, brake in peces, and with one of the fragmentes
slewe the kyng,Kyng Iames of Scotlande

wounded the erle of Angus. The Scottes not dismaied with the death
of their kyng, seyng the Castle easy to be wonne, manfully assauted and
with muche pain gat it, and thesame long defended, till Richard Duke
of Gloucester it conquered and destroyed. This kyng Iames, of quene
Mary his wife left three sonnes, Iames whiche succeded hym, Alexander
duke of Albany, and Ihon. This young kyng Iames, was put vnder
the tuicion of Iames Kenede, bishoppe of sainct Andrewes, whiche
duryng his noneage, ruled the realme to the Kynges greate honor, but
more to his awne profite and peculier gaine: For he made sumpteous
houses, and buylded Colleges, whiche his young pupill kyng Iames,
neither could nor was hable to do.

and that the duke from thensefurth,Articles of agrement betwene Kyng Henry the vi. and Richarde duke of York should be Protector and Regent
of the lande. Prouided allwaie, that if the kyng did closely or apertly,
studie or go aboute to breake or alter this agrement, or to compesse
or imagine the death or destruccion, of the saiede Duke or his
bloud, then he to forfet the croun, and the duke of Yorke to take it. These
articles with many other, were not onely written, sealed, and sworne by
the twoo parties: but also wer enacted, in the high court of Parliament.
For ioye whereof, the Kynge hauyng in his company thesaied Duke,
rode to the Cathedrall Churche of sainct Paule, within the citee of Lō
                  don,
and there on the daie of all Sainctes, went solēpnely with the diademe
on his hed, in procession, and was lodged a good space after, in the
bishoppes Palace, nere to thesaied Churche. And vpon the Saturdaie
next insuyng, Richard Duke of Yorke, was by the sounde of a trumpet,
solempnely proclaimed heire apparāt to the Croune of Englande, and
Protector of the realme.
               
                  AFTER this, the Parliamēt kept at Couentre the last yere, was declared
to be a deuilishe counsaill, and onely celebrate for the destrucciō
of the nobilitie, and no lawfull Parliament, because thei whiche wer returned,
wer neuer elected, accordyng to the dew ordre of the lawe, but secretly
named by theim, whiche desired more the destruccion, then the auauncement
of the publique wealthe, and common profite. When these
agrementes wer doen and enacted, the kyng dissolued his Parliament,
whiche was the laste Parliamente that euer he ended. Suche was the

pleasure of almightie God, that king Henry beeyng a good and verteous
manne, whiche had tasted innumerable aduersities and calamities
of the worlde should be depriued of his terrestrial Croune, to be recompensed
with an heauenly garland, and a ioyfull place: For surely a per

                  ite
good man, all though he be plagued with a thousande displeasures
cannot be but blessed, and haue a good soule toward God.
               
                  THE Duke of Yorke well knowyng, that the Quene would spurne
and impugne the conclusions agreed and taken in this parliament, caused
her and her sonne, to be sent for by the kyng: but she beyng a manly
woman, vsyng to rule and not to be ruled, &amp; therto counsailed by the dukes
of Excester and Somerset, not onely denied to come, but also assembled
together a great army, intendng to take the kyng by fine force, out
of the lordes handes, and to set theim to a new skoole. The Protector liyng
in Londō, hauyng perfite knowledge of all these doynges: assigned
the Duke of Norffolke and the Erle of Warwicke, his trustie frendes,
to be about the Kyng, and he with therles of Salisbury, and Rutlande:
with a conuenient company, departed out of London, the second daie of
Decembre Northward, and sent to the Erle of Marche his eldest sonne
to folowe hym with all his power. The Duke by small iorneis, came to
his Castle of Sandall, beside Wakefelde, on Christmas eue, and there
began to assemble his tenauntes and frendes. The quene beyng thereof
asserteined, determined to couple with hym while his power was small
and his ayde not come: And so hauyng in her company, the Prince her
sonne, the Dukes of Excester and Somerset, the Erle of Deuonshire,
the Lorde Clifford, the Lorde Rosse, and in effecte all the Lordes of the
Northe parte, with eightene thousande men, or as some write, twentie
and twoo thousande, marched from Yorke to Wakefelde, and bad base
to the Duke, euen before his Castle he hauyng with hym not fully fiue
thousande persones, determined intontinent to issue out, and to fight
with his enemies, and all though sir Dauy Halle, his old sernaunt and
chief counsailer, auised hym to kepe his Castle, and to defende thesame
with his smal numbre, till his sonne the Erle of Marche wer come with
his power of Marchemen and Welshe souldiours, yet he would not be
counsailed, but in a great fury saied, a Dauy, Dauy, hast thou loued me
so long, and now wouldest haue me dishonored? Thou neuer sawest me
kepe fortres when I was Regent in Normandy, when the Dolphyn
hymself, with his puissaunce came to besiege me, but like a man, and not
like a birde included in a cage, I issued and fought with myne enemies,
to their losse euer (I thanke God) and to my honor: If I haue not kepte
my self within walles, for feare of a great and strong prince, nor hid my
face from any man liuyng, wouldest thou that I for dread of a scoldyng
woman, whose weapon is onely her toungue, and her nayles, should incarcerate
my self, and shut my gates? then al men might of me woundre
and all creatures maie of me report dishonor, that a woman hath made
me a dastarst, whō no man euer to this daie could yet proue a coward:

And surely my mind is, rather to die with honor, then to liue with shame
for of honor commeth fame, and of dishonor riseth infamy. Their great
numbre shall not appall my spirites, but incorage theim, for surely I
thinke that I haue there, as many frendes as enemies, whiche at ioynyng,
wil either flie or take my part: therfore auaunce my banner, in the
name of God and sainct George, for surely I wil fight with thē, though
I should fight a lone. Therle of Salisbury and other his frendes, seing
his corage, resolued thēselfes to his opinion, &amp; ordered their men, and set
them furth in Warlike fashion, for their moste aduauntage. The Duke
of Somerset and other of the quenes part, knowyng perfitly, that if the
Duke gat the victory, their daies wer minished, and their liuynges left
bare, like men quickened and exasperate, for the safegard of their lifes,
and defence of their goodes, determined to abide the chaunce, and to
espie their moste aduauntage, and so appointed the lorde Clifford, to lye
in the one stale, and the Erle of Wilshire in the other, and thei theimselfes
kept the mayne battaill. The duke of Yorke with his people, discended
doune the hill in good ordre and array, &amp; was suffered to passe foreward,
toward the mayne battaill: but when he was in the plain ground
betwene his Castle and the toune of Wakefelde,The battaill at Wakefeld he was enuironed on
euery side, like a fishe in a net, or a deere in a buckestall: so that he manfully
fightyng, was within halfe an houre slain and ded,The duke of Yorke 
                        •
                     lain. and his whole
army discomfited, &amp; with hym died of his trusty frēdes, his two bastard
vncles, sir Ihon, &amp; sir Hugh Mortimers, sir Dauy Halle his chief coū
                  sailor,
sir Hugh Hastynges, sir Thomas Neuel, William and Thomas
Aparre, bothe brethren, and twoo thousande and eight hundred other,
wherof many wer young gentlemen, and heires of greate parentage in
the Southe parte, whose linages reuenged their deathes, within foure
Monethes, next and immediatly insuyng. In this conflicte was wounded
and taken prisoner, Richarde Erle of Salisbury, sir Richard Lymbrike,
Raufe Stanley, Ihō Harow, Capitain Hauson, and diuerse other
While this battaill was in fightyng, a prieste called sir Robert Aspall,
chappelain and schole master to the yong erle of Rutland ii. sonne to the
aboue named duke of Yorke, scace of y• age of .xii. yeres, a faire gētlemā,
and a maydenlike person, perceiuyng y• flight was more sauegard, then

                     •
                  ariyng, bothe for him and his master, secretly conueyed therle out of y•
felde, by the lord Cliffordes bande, toward the towne, but or he coulde
enter into a house, he was by the sayd lord Clifford espied, folowed, and
taken, and by reson of his apparell, demaunded what he was. The yōg
gentelman dismaied, had not a word to speake, but kneled on his knees
imploryng mercy, and desiryng grace, both with holding vp his hādes
and making dolorous countinance, for his speache was gone for feare.
Saue him sayde his Chappelein, for he is a princes sonne, and peraduenture
may do you good hereafter. With that word, the lord Clifford
marked him and sayde: by Gods blode, thy father slew myne, and so wil
I do the and all thy kyn, and with that woord, stacke the erle to ye hart

with his dagger, and bad his Chappeleyn bere the erles mother &amp; brother
worde what he had done, and sayde. In this acte the lord Clyfford
was accompted a tyraunt, and no gentelman, for the propertie of the
Lyon, which is a furious and an vnreasonable beaste, is to be cruell to
them that withstande hym, and gentle to such as prostrate or humiliate
them selfes before him. Yet this cruell Clifforde, &amp; deadly bloudsupper
not content with this homicyde, or chyldkillyng, came to y• place wher
the dead corps of the duke of Yorke lay, and caused his head to be stryken
of, and set on it a croune of paper, &amp; so fixed it on a pole, &amp; presented
it to the Quene, not lyeng farre farre from the felde, in great despite, and
much derision, saiyng: Madame, your warre is done, here is your kinges
raunsome, at which present, was much ioy, and great reioysing, but
many laughed then, that sore lamented after, as the Quene her self, and
her sonne: And many were glad then of other mēs deaths, not knowing
that their awne were nere at hande, as the lord Clifford, and other.
               But surely, mans nature is so frayle, that thinges passed be sone forgotten,
and mischiefes to come, be not forsene. After this victory by ye
Quene and her parte obteyned, she caused the erle of Salisbury, with
all the other prisoners, to bee sente to Pomfret, and there to bee
behedded, and sent all their heddes, and the dukes head of Yorke, to be
set vpon poles, ouer the gate of the citie of Yorke, in despite of them, and
their lignage: whose chyldren shortly reuenged their fathers querell,
both to the Quenes extreme perdicion, and the vtter vndoynge of her
husband and sonne. This ende had the valeant lord, Rychard Plantagenet,
duke of Yorke, &amp; this fyne ensued of his to much hardines. The
erle of Marche, so commonly called, but after the death of his father, in
dede and in right very duke of Yorke, lyeng at Glocester, heryng of the
death of his noble father, and louyng brother, and trusty frendes, was
wonderfully amased, but after cōfort giuē to him, by his faithful louers
and assured alyes, he remoued to Shrewsbury, and other townes vpon
the ryuer of Seuerne, declaryng to them the murder of his father, the
ieopardye of hym selfe, and the vnstable state and ruyne of the Realme.
The people on the Marches of Wales, which aboue measure fauored y•
lynage of the lord Mortimer, more gladly offered him their ayd &amp; assistence,
then he it either instantly requyred, or hartely desired, soo that he
had a puyssant army, to the number of .xxiij.M. redy to go agaynst the
quene, and the murderers of his father. But when he was settyng forward,
newes were brought to him, that Iaspar erle of Penbroke, halfe
brother to kyng Hēry, and Iames butler, erle of Ormond &amp; Wylshyre
had assembled together a great number, both of Welshe and Irysh people,
sodainly to surprise and take him and his frendes, and as a captiue
to conuey him to the quene. The duke of Yorke, called erle of Marche,
somwhat spurred and quickened with these noueltyes, retired backe, &amp;
mett with his enemies in a faire playne, nere to Mortimers crosse, not
farre from Herford east, on Candelmas day in the mornyng, at whiche

time the sunne (as some write) appered to the erle of March, like .iii. sunnes,
and sodainly ioined al together in one, and that vpō the sight therof,
he toke suche courage, y• he fiercely set on his enemies, &amp; thē shortly
discōfited: for which cause, men imagined, that he gaue the sunne in his
full brightnes for his cognisaūce or badge. Of his enemies were lefte
dead on the ground .iii.M. &amp; .viii.C: The erles of Penbroke and Wilshyre
fled, and syr Owen Tewther, father to the sayd erle of Penbroke,
which Owen had maried kyng Henries mother (as you haue heard before)
with Dauid floyde, Morgan ap reuther, &amp; diuers other were takē
and behedded at the citie of Herford. During this season, ye quene was
greatly encouraged with the victory, obteined late at Wakefeld, partly
because the duke of Yorke, her vtter enemy was ryd out of the worlde, &amp;
partly, because she perceyued, the lordes of the North countrey to adhere
and cleue to her parte and factiō: wherfore with a great multitude
of Northrē people, she marched toward London, of whose approche the
Londoners were nothing glad: for some affirmed, that she brought that
rusty company, to spoile and robbe the citie: other saide, that she would
be reuenged, of suche as fauored the duke of Yorke. So the pore citezēs
hangyng betwene the water and the fyre, were much amased, but ye magistrates
and gouernors caused great watches to be kept, and good order
to be obserued. The Quene, still came forwarde with her Northrē
people entendyng to subuerte and defaict all conclusions and agremē
                  tes,
enacted and assented to, in the last Parliamēt. And so after her long
iorney, she came to the town of sainct Albons: wherof y• duke of Northfolke,
ye erle of Warwycke, and other, whom y• duke of Yorke had lefte
to gouerne the kyng in his absence, beyng aduertised, by the assent of ye
kyng, gathered together a great hoste, and set forward towarde saincte
Albons, hauyng the kyng in their company, as the head and chefetayn
of the warre, and so not mynding to differre the time any farther, vpon
shrouetuesday early in the morning, set vpon their enemies. Fortune y•
day so fauored the Quene, that her parte preuayled, and the duke and
the erle were discomfited, and fled: leauing the king accompanied with
the lord Bonuile, and syr Thomas Kyriell of Kent, whiche vpon assuraunce
of his promise, taried still and fled not, but their trust, them deceiued.
For after the victorie obteyned, and the kynge broughte to the
Quene, they two were deteyned as prisoners, and so continued till the
kynges departyng from that towne. In this battayl were slayn .xxiii.C
men, and not aboue, of whome no noble man is remēbred, saue syr Ihon
Gray, which thesame day was made knight, with .xii. other, at ye village
of Colney. Happy was the quene in her two battayls, but vnfortunate
                     •
                  
was the kyng in all his enterprises, for where his person was presente,
ther victory fled euer from him to the other parte, &amp; he cōmōly was subdued
&amp; vanqueshed. Whē quene Margaret had thus wel sped, first she
caused the kyng, to dubbe prince Edward his sonne, knyght, with .xxx
other persons, which in the morning fought on the quenes side, against

his parte. After she sent to the Mayre of London, commaundinge him
without delay, to sende certain Cartes, laded with lenten victayle, for y•
refreashing of her and her army. The Mayre, incontinent made prouisio,
laded cartes, and sent them toward the quene. But the moueable cō
                  mōs,
which fauored not the quenes parte, stopped ye cartes at Crepulgate
and boldely sayde, that their enemies, which came to spoyle and robbe y•
citizens, should neither be releued, nor victayled by them. And notwithstanding
gentell aduertisement to them gyuen, of the mischefes, whiche
might ensue of their doynges: yet they remayned still in one obstinate
mynd and wilfull will, not permittinge the cariages, to passe or go forward.
During which cōtrouersie, diuers of the Northen horsemē, came
and robbed in the suburbes of the citie, and would haue entered at Crepulgate,
but thei by the commoners were repulsed, and beten backe, and
iii. of them slayn: wherupon the Mayre sent the recorder to the kynges
counsaill to Barne, to excuse the matter, and the duches of Bedford, &amp;
the lady Scales, with diuers sad fathers of the spiritualtie, went to the
quene to mollifie her rancore, and asswage her melācolie, which she had
conceiued against the citie. At this humble request, the quene and her
counsail appointed certayn lordes and knyghtes, with .iii.C. talle persons,
to ryde to the citie, and ther to vewe, &amp; se the demeanoure and disposicion
of the people: &amp; diuers Aldermen were appointed to mete them
at Barnet, and to conuey them to London. But what soeuer man purposeth,
God disposeth: for all these deuises were shortly trāsmuted into
another forme, because trew report was brought, not onely to the citie
but also to the quene, that the erle of Marche had vanqueshed the erles
of Penbroke and Wilshyre, and that the erle of Warwycke, in whome
rested the chefe trust of that faction, after the last conflict, had at saincte
Albons, had mete with the sayd erle of Marche at Chippyng Norton,
by Cottesood, and that they with both their powers were cominge toward
London. These trew tales turned the quenes purpose, and altered
all her long deuised ententes, in so muche that she litle trustinge Essex,
and lesse Kent, but London least of all, with her husband and sonne, departed
from sainct Albons, into the Northcountrey, where the roote, &amp;
foundacion of her ayde and refuge, onely consisted. But at the daye of
her departyng, she caused the heddes of the lord Bonuile, and syr Thomas
Kyriel, to be cut of, in the presence of her sonne, cōtrary to y• mynd
and promise of her husbād, but emōgest men of warre, faith or othe, syldome
is perfourmed.
               
                  THE duches of Yorke, seyng her husband and sonne slayne, and not
knowyng what should succede of her eldest sonnes chaunce, sent her .ii.
yonger sonnes, George &amp; Richard, ouer the sea, to the citie of Wtrechte
in Almayn: where they were of Philippe, duke of Bourgoyne, wel receyued
and fested, and so there thei remayned, till their brother Edwarde
had obteyned the Realme, and gottē the regiment. Duringe which time
diuers merchantes mistrusting the mutacion of the world, fled out of y•
                  
Realme, emōgest whom, one Philippe Malpas, a man of greate riches,
sayling into Flaunders, was taken by Ihon Columme, a French man
and payed .iiii.M. markes for his raunsone. The erles of Marche and
Warwycke, hauyng perfite knowledge, that the kyng and quene with
their adherentes, were departed from sainct Albons, determined first to
ryde to London, as the chefe key, and common spectacle to the whole
Realme, thinking there to assure them selfs of the East and West parte
of the Kingdome, as king Henry and his faction nesteled and strēgthēd
hun and his alyes, in the North regions and boreal plage: meaninge
to haue a buckelar against a swourd, and a southerne byl, to cōteruayle
a Northren bas
                     •
                  ard. And so these two great lordes, resoluinge them selfs
vpon this purpose, accompanied with a great number of men of warre,
entered the citie of London, in the first weke of Lēt. What should I declare
how the Kentishmen resorted: how the people of Essex swarmed, &amp;
how the counties adioyning to Londō, dayly repaired to se, ayd, &amp; comfort,
this lustly prince and flower of chiualry, as he in whome the hope,
of their ioy, and the trust of their quietnes onely then consisted. Thys
wise and prudent noble man, perceiuing the most parte of the Realme,
to be to him frendly and adherent, mynoing to take time when time serued,
called a great counsaill, both of lordes spirituall and temporall, &amp;
to them repeted the title, and right that he had to the Realme, &amp; dignitie
royall: rehersing the articles of the agrement, not onely concluded betwene
kyng Henry, &amp; his noble father, Richard duke of Yorke, by theyr
writinges signed and sealed: but also corroborated, &amp; cōfirmed by aucthoritie
of the high court of Parliament: the breaches whereof, he neither
forgat, nor omitted vndeclared. After the lordes had considered, &amp;
weyghed his title and declaracion, thei determined by authoritie of the
sayd counsaill, for as much as kyng Henry, contrary to his othe, honor
and agrement, had violated and intringed, the order taken and enacted
in the last Parliament, and also, because he was insufficient to rule the
Realme, and inutile to the common wealth, and publique profite of the
pore people, he was therfore by the aforesayd authoritie, depriued and
detected of all kyngly honor, and regall souereigntie. And incontinent,
Edward erle of Marche, sonne and heyre to Richard duke of Yorke,
was by the lordes in the sayd counsaill as
                     •
                  embled, named, elected, &amp; admitted,
for kyng and gouernour of the realme: on which day, the people
of the erles parte, beyng in their muster in sain
                     •
                  t Ihons felde, &amp; a great
number of the substanciall citezens there assembled, to behold their order:
sodaynly the lord Fawcōbridge, which toke the musters, wisely declared
to the multitude, the offences and breaches of the late agremente
done and perpetrated by kyng Hēry the .vi. and demaunded of the people,
whether thei woulde haue the sayd kyng Henry to rule and reigne
any lenger ouer them: To whome they, with a whole voyce, aunswered
nay, nay. Then he asked thē, if thei would ser
                     •
                  e, loue, and obey the erle
of March as their earthly prince and souereign lord. To which questiō
                  
they aunswered, yea, yea, crieng, king Edward, with many great showtes
and clappyng of handes. The lordes were shortly aduertised of the
louyng consent, which the commons franckely and frely of their fre wil
had giuen, wherupon incontinent, they all with a conueniēt number of
the most substanciall commons, repaired to Baynardes castel, making
iust and trew report to the erle of their eleccion and admission, and the
louyng assent of the faithfull commons. The erle after long pausynge,
first thanked God of his great grace and benefite, then to him declared
and shewed, and the lordes and commons also, for their harty fauour,
and assured fidelitie, and notwithstanding that, like a wise prince, he alledged
his insufficiencie for so greate a roome and weyghty burden, as
lacke of knowledge, want of experiēce &amp; diuers other qualities, to a gouernour
apperteyninge: yet in conclusion he beynge perswaded by the
Archebishop of Cāterbury, the bishop of Excester and other lordes, thē
beyng present, graunted to their peticion, and toke vpō him the charge
and vpon the next day, beyng the .iiii. day of Marche, he as kyng, rode
to the church of sainct Paule, and there offered. And after Te deum song,
with great solempnitie, he was conueyed to Westmynster, and there set
in the hawle, with the scopter royall in his hand, where, to al the people
which there in great number were assembled, his title and clayme to the
croune of England, was declared by .ii. maner of wayes: the firste, as
sonne and heyre to duke Richard his father, right enheritor to thesame:
the second, by aucthoritie of Parliament and forfeiture committed by,
kyng Henry. Wherupō it was agayne demaunded of the commons, if
they would admitte, and take the sayd erle, as their prince &amp; souereigne
lord, which al with one voice cried, yea, yea. Which agremēt cōcluded,
He entered into Westmynster church vnder a canapy, with solēpne procession,Kyng Edward the .iiii. proclamed king of Englande.
and there as kyng offered, and after the homages taken of al the
nobles there present, he returned by water to London, and was lodged
in the bishops palace: Dayly makyng prouision to go Northwarde against
his aduerse faccion and open enemies, and on the morow he was
proclaymed kyng, by the name of kyng Edward the .iiii. throughout y•
citie. While these thinges were in doyng in the Southpart, king Hēry
beyng in the Northcountrey, thinking because he had slayn the duke of
Yorke, the chefe Capitayn of the contrary lynage, that he had brought
all thyng to purpose and conclusion as he would, assembled a great army,
trusting with litle payne and small losse, to destroy the residew of
his enemies, whom he estemed to be of no force, or of a small validitie.
But he was sore deceiued: for out of the dead stocke, sprang a stronge &amp;
mightie braunche, which by no meanes could either be broken, or made
sere: which was this kyng Edward the .iii. whiche was so beloued and
fauoured of the people, that no man was spokē of, no person was remē
                  bred,
but only he: for he was so much estemed, bothe of the nobilitie and
commonaltie, for his liberalitie, clemencie, integritie, and corage, that
aboue all other, he was extolled and praysed to the very heauē. By reason

whereof men of al ages &amp; of al degrees to him dayly repaired, some
offering theym selfes and their men to ieopard their lifes with him, and
other plenteously gaue him money, to support his charges and mayntayne
his warre. By reason wherof, he assembled together a puissant
army, to thentent to gyue to his enemies a fierce and sharpe battayle, &amp;
so in one day to obteyn his purpose and make an ende of all his troble.
When his army was redy, and al thinges prepared, he departed out of
London the .xii. day of Marche, &amp; by easy iourneys came to the castell
of Pomfret, where he rested, appointyng the lorde Fitzwater, to kepe y•
passage at Ferybridge, with a great number of talle personages. Let no
man thinke or yet imagine, that either the counsaill of kynge Henry, or
his vigilant quene, either neglected or forgat to know or searche what
their enemies did, but that they prepared to their power all y• men, that
they either could perswade or allure to their purpose to take their part.
And thus thinking them selfs furnished, committed the gouernaūce of
the armye to the duke of Somerset, the erle of Northumberland, and ye
lord Clifford, as men desiring to reuenge ye death of their parētes slayn
at the first battayle of sainct Albons. These noble 
                     •
                  apitaynes, leauing
kyng Henry, his wyfe, and sonne, for their most sauegard in the citie of
Yorke, passed the ryuer of Wharfe, with all their power, entendinge to

more expedicion and exployt of their purpose (after many comparisons
made betwene the erle of Northumberland, and the lord Clifford, bothe
beynge in lusty yought, &amp; of franke corage) the lorde Clifforde determined
with his light horsemen, to make an assaye to suche as kepte the
passage of Ferybridge, and so departed from the great army, on the Saturday
before Palmsondaye, and early or his enemies were ware, gat
the bridge, and slew the kepers of thesame, and al such as woulde withstand
him. The lord Fitzwater hearing the noyse, sodainly rose out of
his bed, and vnarmed, with a pollax in his hande, thinking ye it had byn
a fray emōgest his mē, came doune to appeace thesame, but or he either
began his tale, or knew what the matter meāt, he was slayne, and with
him the bastard of Salisbury, brother to the erle of Warwycke, a valeaunt
young gentelman, and of great audacitie. When the erle of Warwycke
was enformed of this feate, he like a man desperate, moūted on
his Hackeney, and came blowyng to kyng Edward saiyng: syr I praye
God haue mercy of their soules, which in the beginnyng of your enterprise,
hath lost their lifes, and because I se no succors of the world, I remit
the vengeaunce and punishment to God our creator and redemer,

                  THE lusty kyng Edward, perceiuing the courage of histrusty frēd
the erle of Warwycke, made proclamacion that all men, whiche were
afrayde to fighte, shoulde incontinent departe, and to all mē that tarried

the battell, he promised great rewardes with this addicion, that if
any souldiour, which volūtariely would abide, and in, or before the conflict
flye, or turne his backe, that then he that could kil him, should haue
a great remuneraciō and doble wages. After thys proclamaciō ended
the lord Fawconbridge, syr Water Blout, Robert Horne with forward,
passed the ryuer at Castelford .iij. myles from Ferebridge, entending
to haue enuironed and enclosed the lord Clyfford and his cōpany,
but they beyng therof aduertised, departed in great haste toward kyng
Henries army,The conflict at Ferebridge but thei mete with some that thei loked not for, and were

with all solempnitie receyued: and first he caused the heddes of his father,

and set vp, partly because he
had obteined so great a conquest, and
partely, because he perceiued, that aswell
the nobles as the commōs of the
Realme, began to drawe to hym, and
to take his part, after the fashion and
maner of a triumphaunt conqueror,
and victorious champion, with great
pompe returned to London. Where (according to the old custome of the
realme) he called a great assemble of persons of all degrees: and the .xxix
daie of Iune, was at Westminster with all solempnitie crounedand anoynted
Kyng, and called Kyng Edwarde the .iiij. after Willyam the
Conqueror, which was in the yere of Christes incarnacion .M.iiii.C.lxj.
            
               IN the whiche yere, he called his high Court of Parliament, wherewith
thestate of the Realme was wholy set in good ordre, and specially
such thynges as apperteined to the cōmon wealth, whiche wer to muche
neglected and decaied. Duryng the tyme of the ciuill and intestine war,
he caused all statutes and ordinaunces made by kyng Henry the sixte,
(whiche either touched his title or his profite) to bee adnihilate and frutrate.
In the whiche Parliament, the Erle of Oxford farre striken in
age, and the Lorde Ambrey Ueer, his sonne and heire, whether it wer for
malice of their enemies, or thei wer suspected, or had offended the Kyng,
thei bothe and diuerse of their counsailors, wer attainted and put to execucion,
whiche caused Ihon erle of Oxford, euer after to rebell. And afterward
he created his twoo younger brethern Dukes, that is to saie:
Lorde George, Duke of Clarence, lorde Richard, Duke of Gloucester,
and lorde Ihon Neuell, brother to Richard Erle of Warwicke, he first
made Lorde Mountacute, and afterwardes created hym Marques
Mountacute. Beside this, Henry Burchier, brother to Thomas Archebishop
of Cantorbury was created Erle of Essex, and William Lorde
Fawconbrige, was made Erle of Kent. To this Lorde Henry Burchier
beyng a noble man in marciall actes, highly approued and renoumed,
Richard Duke of Yorke, long before this tyme, had geuen his suster Elizabeth
in mariage: Hauyng a firme hope, and a sure confidence, that
he and his generacion, should be a perpetuall aide to the Duke and his
sequele, aswell in prosperitie as aduersitie, associate together in al chances
of fortune, which trust he did not defraude, as afterward appered to

Kyng Edward the fourth, sonne to thesaid duke Richard, whiche for his
assured fidelitie, made hym Erle of Essex: to thende that bothe he the father,
and his sōne, should euer be to hym, bothe an aide and a bulwarke.
This Erle Henry, begat of lady Elizabeth his wife, foure sonnes, William,
Thomas, Ihon, and Henry, and one doughter named Isabel, whiche
liued bat a small season. In the whiche sonnes, in compassyng and
bryngyng greate thynges to passe, there lacked no industrie, nor prouidence:
in grauous and waightie affaires, there wanted neither labor nor
diligence: in all ieoperdies, thei wer hardy, strong, and coragious: and

                  WHen al these chaūces, thus luckely happened to kyng Edward,
and all thynges in maner were framed, as he would
haue theim: Henry duke of Somerset, sir Raufe Percie,
and diuerse other, beyng in dispaire, and out of hope of all
good chaunce, that might happen to kyng Henry the sixte,
came humbly and submitted theimselfes, whom he gentely interteined,
and louyngly receiued. Of whiche deede, the duke shortly repented him
and so did some of the other.
               
                  ALL this season was kyng Henry the .vj. in Scotlande, whiche to
haue the more aide and comfort of the Scottishe king, he deliuered vnto
hym the toune of Barwicke, (as you before haue heard) whiche had
been continually, in the possession of Englishmen, from the tyme of kyng
Edward the firste, whiche, with hardy corage, manfull assautes, slaughter
of many thousandes of Scottes, valiauntly conquered thesame.
This same season also, quene Margaret beyng in Fraunce, by the meanes
of her father and frendes, found suche frendship at the French kynges
handes, that she obteined a crewe of fiue hundred Frenchemen, whiche
was but a small numbre, for her purpose, and yet a greater number
then her husbande or she, were able to intertein in wages, of their awne

                     •
                  offers. She thus beyng accompanied, with these bostyng Frenchmen,
of whom sir Piers Bracy, a Bryton knight was Capitain, a man more
fierce in the house▪ then in the feld, and yet more fierce in fliyng from the

                     •
                  eld to the house, then hardy to set foreward from the house to the feld, set
vp her sailes, and with a prosperous wind, arriued in Scotland. If she
and her company, wer welcome to her husbande and sonne, I report me
to suche as languish, and would haue succor, and to suche as lacke aide,

and would be comforted. The Quene and her company,Quene Margarete wi
                        •
                     h her company arriueth at Tynmouth. thought to doo
some greate enrterprise, (as the nature of the Frenchemen is, to bee more
busy then bold) sailed with her gallant band, toward Newe Castle, and
landed at Tynmouthe. But whether she wer a fraied of her awne shadow,
or that the Frenchemen cast to many doubtes, the truth is, that the
whole army returned to their shippes, and a tēpest rose so sodainly, that
if she had not taken a small Caruell, and that with good spede, arriued
safe at Barwicke: she had neither vexed kyng Edward after, as she did
with a newe inuasion, nor yet she had not liued all her old age, in misery
wretchednes, and callamitie, as she did, leasyng bothe her husbande, her
sonne, her Realme, and her honor. And although fortune was so fauorable
to her, yet her company were with stormy blastes, driuen on the
shore before Bāborough castle, where thei set their shippes on fire, and
cowardly fled to an Island, called holy Island, wher thei wer so assailed
by the bastard Ogle, an Esquire called Ihon Manners, with other of
kyng Edwardes retinue, that many of them wer slain, and almoste .iiii.C.
taken prisoners, and put to raunsome. But the capitain Bracy more
coward then coragious, happened by chaunce of a fishar man, &amp; so came
to Barwicke, to Quene Margaret his mastres: whether she gaue hym
thankes or no, I doubte, but sure I am, he none deserued, yet she made
hym capitain of Alnewike Castle, whiche he with his freshe men kepte
till thei wer rescowed. This chaunce litle amased the Quene, nor in any
thyng abated her haute corage. For incontinently she obteined a greate
company of Scottes, and other of her frendes, and so bringyng her husband
with her, and leauyng her sōne called prince Edward, in the toune
of Barwicke, entered Northumberlande, and toke the castle of Bamborough,
and stuffed it with Scottes, and made therof capitain sir Raufe
Gray, and came forward towarde the Bishopricke of Durham. When
the Duke of Somerset heard these newes, he without delaye refused
kyng Edward, and rode in poste to his kynsman, kyng Henry the sixte:
verefiyng the old prouerbe: kynne will 
                     •
                  repe, where it maie no go: Refusyng
the surety of his estate, whiche kyng Edward did promise hym, for
the vncertain gain whiche he hoped to get, by supportyng kyng Henry.
With hym fled also sir Raufe Percy, and many other of the kynges frē
                  des,
but many mo folowed hym, for coueteousnes of spoyle and rapyne:
in so muche that the puyssaunce of kyng Henry, was thought to bee of
as muche force, as the strength and army, of his enemy kyng Edward.
The which army was iudged to be y• greater, because he spoyled, &amp; burned
tounes, and destroyed feldes, whersoeuer he cam. Kyng Edward (as
you could not blame hym) was with these dooynges nothyng content,
wherefore like a wise prince, intendyng to stop the gut of kyng Henries
power, or it made any farther issue: Prepared al municions, conuenient
for the warre, rigged and apparreled, a great nauie of shippes, of which
some were vitailed at Lyn, and some at Hull, and thei were furnished
with souldiors. When his army by the sea, was thus warlikely set forward:

he sent the lorde Montacute, (whom bothe for his hardinesse and
sage conduyte in marciall affaires, he muche trusted and beleued) into
Northumberlande, there to raise the people, to withstande his enemies.
And after this, he in his royall persone, accompanied with his brethren,
and a greate part of the nobilitie of his realme, not without a great and
puyssaunt armie, marched toward his enemies, and came to the citee of
Yorke, sendyng a greate quantitie of his faithfull subiectes, to the ayde
of the lorde Montacute, least paraduenture he geuyng to muche confidence,
to the men of the Bisshopprike and Northumberlande, might by
theim be deceiued and surprised. The Lorde Montacute, forgat not the
office of a good capitain; nor beeyng well furnished with suche as he
knewe would neither flie backeward, nor stande still lookyng, and not
fightyng, thought no lēger to tract the tyme, but with a valiant corage,
marched forward toward his enemies, and in his iorney, he was incountered,
with the lorde Hungerford, the Lorde Roos, sir Raufe Percy, and
diuerse other, at a place called Hegely More. Where sodainly thesaied
lordes, in maner without stroke strikyng, fled, and onely sir Raufe Percy
abode, and was there manfully slain, with diuerse other, saiyng▪ when
he was diyng: I haue saued the birde in my bosome: meanyng that he
had kept, both his promise and othe, to kyng Henry the .vj: Forgettyng
that he in kyng Henries moste necessitie, abandoned him, and submitted
hym to kyng Edward, (as you before haue heard.) The lord Mōtacute
seyng fortune thus prosperously leadyng his saile, was auaunced with
hardy corage toward his enemies, &amp; then in passyng forward, he had by
his espialles perfite intelligence, that kyng Henry with all his power,
was incamped in a faire plain called Lyuels, on the water of Dowill in
Exham shire.The battaile at Li

                     wil in Exham shire. It was no neede to bid hym hast hast, as he that thought
not to lese the occasion, to hym so manifestly geuen, &amp; to leaue the good
porte of fortune, to hym opened and vnclosed: and therefore, in good ordre
of battail, he manfully set on his enemies, in their awne cāpe, whiche
like desperate persones, with no small corage receiued hym. There was
a sore fought feld, and no partie by a long tract, could get any aduauntage
of the other, till at the last, the lorde Montacute, criyng on his men
to do valiauntly, entered by plain force, the battaill of his enemies, and
brake their array, whiche like men amased, fled hether and thether, desperate
of all succor. In whiche flight and chase, wer taken, Henry duke of
Somerset, whiche before was reconciled to Kyng Edwarde, the Lorde
Roos, the Lorde Molyns, the Lorde Hungerford, sir Thomas Wentworth,
sir Thomas Huse, sir Ihon Fynderne, &amp; many other. Kyng Henry
was this daie, the beste horseman of his company: for he fled so faste
that no man could ouertake hym, and yet he was so nere pursued, that
certain of his henxmen or folowers wer taken, their horses beyng trapped
in blew veluet: wherof one of thē had on his hed, shesaid kyng Henries
healmet. Some say his high cap of estate, called abococket, garnished
with twoo riche Crounes, whiche was presented to kyng Edward,

at Yorke the fourth daie of Maie. The Duke of Somerset, was incontinently,
for his greate mutabilitie and lightnes, behedded at Exam, the
other lordes and knightes, wer had to New Castle, and there after alitle
respite, wer likewise put in execucion. Beside these persons, diuerse other
to the numbre of .xxv. wer executed at Yorke, and in other places: wherby
other fautors of kyng Henries partie, should be out of all trust of al
victory, consideryng that their capitaines, had hopped hedles. Frō this
battaill escaped kyng Henry the .vj. sir Humfrey Neuell, Williā Taylboys,
callyng hymself erle of Keme, sir Raufe Gray, and Richard Tunstall,
and diuerse other, whiche beyng in feare of takyng, hid themselfes
and lurked in dēnes and wholes secretly. Thei wer not so closly hid, but
thei were espied: for the erle of Keme was taken in a close place in Riddesdale▪
and brought to New Castle, and there with an axe lost his life,
Sir Humfrey Neuel, after long lurkyng in a Caue, was taken in Holdernes,
and at Yorke behedded. Thus euery man almoste that escaped,
was after taken and scorged: so that it should seme that God had ordeined,
all suche persones as rebelled against kyng Edward, to haue in cō
                  clusion,
death for their reward and guardone.
               
                  AFTER this battaill called Exham feld, kyng Edward came to the
citie of Duresme, to the intent to bee more nerer to his enemies, if thei
would make any farther attempte: and sent from thence into Northumberlande,
the Erle of Warwicke, the lorde Montacute, the lordes,
Fawconbrige and Scrope, and diuerse other, to recouer suche Castles
and fortresses, as his enemies there held, and with force defēded. These
lordes first besieged the castle of Alnewike, whiche sir Piers Bracy and
the Frenchemen, by force and strong hande kepte, and in no wise would
yeld, sendyng for ayde to the Scottes, wherupon sir George Douglas,
erle of Angus, with .xiii.M. men well chosen, in the daie tyme rescowed
the Frenchemen out of the castle, the Englishemen lookyng on, whiche
thought it muche better to haue the castle, without losse of their mē, then
to lese bothe the castle and their men, consideryng the great power of the
Scottes, and their smal numbre: and so thei entered the castle and manned
it, and after thesaied lordes, besieged the castle of Dunstanborogh,
and by force toke it, and Ihon Goys seruaunt to the duke of Somerset
capitain of thesaid castle, was taken and brought to Yorke: where, with
a hachet he receiued his reward. These Lordes also tooke by force, the
strong castle of Bamborough, and in it sir Raufe Gray, whiche was before
sworne to kyng Edward, for the whiche periurie to bothe the princes,
he was disgraded of the high ordre of knighthode at Dancastre,The disgradynge of a knight. by
cuttyng of his gylt sporres, rētyng his cote of armes, and breakyng his
sword ouer his hed: and finally, there his body was shorted, by the lēgth
of his hed, and had no more harme, thus was he rewarded for his doble
deceipt, and manifest periurie.
               
                  AFTER this victory, kyng Edward returned to Yorke, where, in
despite of therle of Northumberlande, whiche then lurked, in the realme

of Scotland, he created sir Ihon Neuel, lorde Montacute, erle of Northumberlande,
&amp; in reprofe of Iaspar erle of Penbroke, he created William
lord Herbert, erle of thesame place: but after when by mediacion of
frendes, therle of Northumberlande, was reconciled to his fauor, he restored
hym fully to his possessiōs, name and dignitie: and not intendyng
therby, to diminishe the honor of his frend, he preferred sir Ihon Neuel,
to the stile of Marques Montacute, and so by that meanes, he was in
estate and degre higher, then therle of Warwicke his elder brother, but
in power, pollecie, and possessions, farre baser and lower.
            
            
               ¶The thirde yere.The .iii yere.
               
               
                  ALthough that Kyng Edward might now thynke, all thynges
to be in a good case, &amp; hymself also to be of puyssance sufficient
against al his enemies, (for yt he had obteined so great a victory):
yet did he prouide with all diligence, that neither kyng
Henry, nor quene Margaret his wife, should by any meanes remain in
Englande: least the sight with the perswasions of theim, and especially
with old frendes &amp; alies, might alter and change the mindes, &amp; also wyn
the hartes of the mutable cōmonaltie. Wherfore he edified bulwarkes,
and buylded fortresses on euery side &amp; parte of his realme, where might
be any place propice and mete, for an armie to arriue or take lande. Beside
this, he wrote to all them in the South partes of his realme, that in
no wise thei should receiue thesaied quene, nor in any thyng should help
or minister to her: and if any did presume or attempt, priuatly or openly
to infringe his will and commaundement, the offendors should be takē
as his aduersaries, &amp; punished as his vtter enemies. And on that parte
that marcheth vpon Scotland, he laied watches and espialles, that no
persone should go out of the realme, to kyng Henry and his company:
whiche then lay soiornyng in Scotlande. But what so euer ieoperdy or
perill might bee construed or demed, to haue insued by the meanes of
kyng Henry: all suche doubtes, were now shortly resolued and determined,
and all feare of his doynges, wer clerely put vnder and extinct. For
he hymself, whether he wer past all feare, or was not well stablished in
his perfite mynde, or could not long kepe hymself secrete, in a disguysed
apparell, boldely entered into Englande. He was no soner entered, but
he was knowen and taken of one Cantlowe, and brought towarde the
kyng, whom the erle of Warwicke met on the waie, by the kynges commaundement,Kyng Henry the .vi. taken, and cōmitted to the Toure of London.
and brought hym through London, to the toure, and
there he was laied in sure holde. Quene Margarete his wife, hearyng
of the captiuitie of her husbande, mistrustyng the chaunce of her sonne,
all desolate and comfortles, departed out of Scotlande, and sailed into
Fraunce, where she remained with Duke Reyner her father, till she toke
her infortunate iorney into Englande again: where she lost bothe husband
and sōne, and also all her wealth, honor, and worldly felicitie. The
newe Duke of Somerset and his brother Ihon, sailed into Flaunders,

where thei also liued in greate misery, till duke Charles, because he was
of their kyn, and discended of the house of Lancastre by his mother, succored
them with a small pencion, whiche to them was a greate comfort.
Therle of Penbroke wēt from countrey to countrey, not alwaies at his
hartes ease, nor in securitie of life, or suretie of liuing. Such an vnstable
and blind goddes is fortune: for whē he that sitteth highest on the whele
falleth to the groūd, all that be vnderneth fall also, and can neither haue
aide nor helpe of her, nor yet of theimselfes.
               
                  AFTER the takyng of kyng Hēry the .vj. and the departyng of his
wife, this realme was in more quietnes &amp; tranquilitie, because that men
of the contrary part and faccion, durst not once attēpt nor yet moue, any
new tumulte or conspiracie, consideryng that bothe the hed was fallen,
and the chief membres fled and vanquished. Wherfore kyng Edward,
beyng clerely out of doubt, of all hostilitie and danger, set all his mynd
the whole foure yeres folowyng, for bothe amendyng thynges preiudiciall
to the common wealthe, and also for stablishyng of thynges, mete
and necessary, for the people of his Realme and dominion. And firste of
al, folowyng the old auncient adage whiche saith, that the hus
                     •
                  andman
ought first to tast of the new growē frute: he distributed the possessions,
of suche as toke parte with kyng Henry the .vi. to his souldiors and capitai
                     •
                  es,
whiche he thought had well deserued it. And beside, he lefte no
poynt of liberalitie vnshewed, by the whiche he might allure to hym, the
beneuolence and louyng hartes of his people: and in especial to his nobilitie,
he gaue bothe large and precious giftes and rewardes. And because
yt he would gladly haue the loue of all men, aswell noble as ignoble,
aswell of riche as of poore, he shewed hymself more familiar, bothe
with the nobilitie and the commonaltie, then (as some mē thought) was
conuenient, either for his estate, or for his honor: whiche gentilnes and
frendly familiaritie, he euer after vsed. The lawes of the realme,Kyng Edward the iiii. deuised the names of the Coynes. in part
he reformed, and in part he newly augmented. The coyne bothe of golde
and of siluer, whiche yet at this daie is curraunt, he newly deuised and
diuided: for the gold he named royals and nobles, and the siluer he called
grotes and halfe grotes. After this, he caused open Proclamacion to
be diuulged, that all persones whiche were adherent to his aduersaries
part, &amp; would leaue their armure, &amp; submit thēselfes wholy to his grace
and mercye, should bee clerely remitted, pardoned, and relessed: and thei
that obstinatly would so refuse, should haue such paines, as by the law,
to suche transgressors, was assigned and appoynted. What profite this
gentle interteinyng of his people brought hym to: What good wil and
fixed hartes of the people, he obteined by this kynd and frendly handelyng,
all mē may with their iyes manifestly perceiue. For only by the fauor
and ayde of the people, euer after in all his warres, he was a victor
and a conqueror: so that all enterprises afterward against hym attempted,
had either euill successe, or wer sone refelled, as afterward you shall
perceiue. When he had brought his Realme into this estate, he surely

thynkyng, and no lesse trustyng, but that he was set in the sure stall, sta

throne, and vnmoueable chaire, of the croune of his realme and kyngdom,
was not only desirous of hymself, beyng a prince of haut corage▪
young, lusty, and sanguyne of complexion, to haue a wife, but was also
daily 
                     •
                  ollicited, required, and mocioned of the peres and nobilitie of the
Realme, to ioyne with suche a make, as should bee bothe to his honoure
and contentacion, and also for the securitie &amp; establishment, of the royall
succession and continuaunce of his progeny, in his newe possessed countrey,
and late recouered kingdom. Wherupon, like a wis
                     •
                   and a circumspecte
Prince, very desirous of a Quene, but more thirstyng for suche a
make, by the aide of whose parentes, alies and confederates: he beyng
ioyned with theim in perfite affinitie, might litle or nothyng doubte the
attemptes of his aduersarie kyng Henry, nor yet the malice of his secret
frendes and priuy fautors. This matter (as it was of great waight and
importance) hangyng long in consultacion: Emongest other it was moued,
to send to Iames the .iii, kyng of Scottes, for the obteinyng of the
faire lady Margaret his suster, to thintent, that▪ on that side, kyng Henry
his aduersary, should be destitute of all aide, refuge, succor, and comfort:
but whether it wer for a priuie sickenes, or an open impediment, to
hym and his counsaill declared, or by them spied, this mocion vanished
and toke no farther effect. Then (as many men haue said, &amp; few or none
haue written) it was farther consulted, that the lady Elizabeth, suster &amp;
heire apparant, to Done Henry kyng of Castle, (whiche afterward was
his heire in deede, and maried to Done Fernādo, kyng of Arragon) was
a mariage for hym moste conuenient, and not so conuenient, as profitable
bothe to hym and his realme, and theim that should lineally succede
hym, consideryng that if he might obtein the kyngdom of Castell, of the
whiche his greate graund mother, was one of the indubitate heires, as
doughter to Done Peter, late kyng of Castell, (by the valiaunt knight,
Edward prince of Wales, restored to his seigniory, realme &amp; kingdom)
then wer he in cace, not onely hable to defend hymself, and his realme of
Englande, against all foren enemies, and vtter inuasions, but also he
should be of puyssance sufficient to inuade, and likely to recouer the duchy
of Guyen, yea, and whole Acquitain, beyng his awne true and lawefull
inheritance, with the ayde onely of the Castilians▪ puttyng the Englishement
to litle trauaill, &amp; lesse charge. This mocion thus setforward
semed highly to redounde, bothe to the honor of the kyng, and the high
auauncement of thestate of the realme: Consideryng first, the high parē
                  tage
of the woman, and secondly, the indubitate expectacion o
                     •
                   thinheritance,
of the realmes of Castell and Lion. And this mariage agred vpon,
(whiche semeth more likely to be intreated of, then cōcluded as the
tale tellers saie). The erle of Warwicke was sent into Spain, well instructed,
and no lesse accompanied, for the conclusiō of thesaid mariage.
But who so will diligently consider, and in egall balaunce ponder, the
youth and appetite of kyng Edward, and the tendre age and minoritie

of this noble damosell: maie euidently perceiue, that it was neither decent
nor conuenient, for hym nor his realme, to expect and tary the maturitie
and ful age of this noble princes, nor that he beyng a prince, wel
cherished, of lustie courage, and apte to generacion, would or could liue
sole and vnmaried without a wife, till she were of age, mete &amp; conueniēt
for his bed. For it appereth on her goodly sepulture, in the cite of Granado
(where she is buried) and also diuerse famous and notable Historiographers,
bothe of Spain and other regions, write and affirme, that
she changed this transitory life, in the yere of our Lorde .M.D.vi. beyng
L. yeres of age, one moneth onely lackyng. By whiche report she should
be borne, in the yere of our lorde .M.iiii.C.lvi. And when therle of Warwicke
was sent for the mariage of kyng Edwarde, in the beginnyng of
the third yere of his reigne, the yere of our lord .M.cccc.lxiii, so that then
she was sixe and not fully .vii. yeres, at whiche tyme kyng Edward had
fully accōplished .xxiiii. yeres and more. The treatie of whiche mariage
although it be not vnpossible, yet for ye causes aforsaied, it semeth not alitle
vnlikely. But admit that this mariage was moued, as it peraduē
                  ture
might be, and that the erle of Warwicke sailed into Spain, (as he
did not in deede) of likelihod his legacion was frustrate, &amp; came to none
effect: but sure it is that thesame yere, he cam to kyng Lewes the .xi. then
beyng Frenche kyng, liyng at Tours, and with greate honor was there
receiued, and honorably interteined: of whō,The treaty

                      .iiii. for kyng Edward his master,
he demaunded to haue in mariage the lady Bona, doughter to Lewes
duke of Sauoy, and suster to the lady Carlot, then French Quene,
beyng then in the Frenche court. This mariage semeth pollitiquely deuised,
and of an high imaginacion to be inuented, if you will well consider,
the state and condicion of kyng Edwardes affaires, which at this
time, had kyng Henry the vi. in safe custody, in the strong toure of London,
and the moste parte of his adherentes, he had as he thought, either
profligated or extinct, Quene Margaret onely except, and Prince Edward
her sonne, whiche wer then soiornyng at Angiers, with old Duke
Reiner of Aniow her father, writyng hymself kyng of Naples, Scicile,
and Ierusalem, hauing as muche profites of the letters of his glorious
stile, as rentes and reuenues out of thesaid large and riche realmes and
dominions, (because the kyng of Arragon toke the profites of thesame▪
and would make no accōpt therof to duke Reiner). Kyng Edward therfore
thought it necessary, to haue affinitie in Fraunce, and especially by
the Quenes suster: whiche Quene, although she ruled not the kyng her
husband, (as many womē do) yet he of a certain especiall humilitie, was
more content to haue her fauor &amp; folowe her desire, (for wedded men oftē
tymes doubt stormes) rather then to haue a lowryng countenaunce, and
a ringing peale, whē he should go to his rest and quietnes: trusting that
by this mariage, quene Margarete (whom thesame Quene Carlot litle
or nothyng regarded, although her father was called a kyng and she a
quene, &amp; none of both hauing subiectes, profites, nor dominions) should

haue no aide, succor, nor any cōfort of y• Frēch kīg, nor of none of his frē
                  des
nor alies, wherfore quene Carlot much desirous to aduāce her blod
&amp; progenie, &amp; especially to so great a prince as kyng Edward was, obteyned
both the good will of the kyng her husband, &amp; also of her syster,
so that the matrimony on that syde was clerely assented to, &amp; the erle of
Dampmartine appoīted with other,The mariage cōcluded for kīg Edward the .iiii. to sayle into Englād, for the clerely
finishyng of thesame. After these thinges thus concluded, the erle of
Warwycke was dismissed and highly rewarded, &amp; for the great &amp; noble
corage that was in him, he obteyned such fauor of the kynge, the quene
and the nobles of Fraūce, that when he fled out of Englād, he was there
honorably receiued, frendly maynteined, and louingly succored, as you
shall perceyue hereafter.
               
                  BVT now consider the olde prouerbe to be true y• saieth: that mariage
is destinie. For duryng ye time that the erle of Warwycke was thus
in Fraunce, concludyng a mariage for kyng Edward: The king being
on huntyng in the forest of Wychwod besyde Stonnystratforde, came
for his recreacion to the mannor of Grafton, where the duches of Bedford
soiorned, then wyfe to syr Richard Woduile, lord Ryuers, on whō
then was attendyng a doughter of hers, called dame Elizabeth Greye,
wydow of syr Ihon Grey knight, slayn at the last battell of saincte Albons,
by the power of kyng Edward. This wydow hauyng a suyt to y•
kyng, either to be restored by hym to some thyng taken from her, or requyring
hym of pitie, to haue some augmentacion to her liuyng, founde
such grace in the kynges eyes, that he not onely fauored her suyte, but
muche more phantasied her person,Kyng Edward falleth in loue with the buches of Bedfo
                        •
                     des doughter, 
                        •
                      after marieth her. for she was a womā more of formal
countenaunce, then of excellent beautie, but yet of such beautie &amp; fauor,
that with her sober demeanure, louely lokyng, and femynyne smylyng,
(neither to wanton nor to humble) besyde her toungue so eloquent, and
her wit so pregnant, she was able to rauishe the mynde of a meane person,
whē she allured, and made subiect to her, y• hart of so great a king.
After that kyng Edward had well considered all the linyamētes of her
body, and the wise and womanly demeanure that he saw in her, he determined
first to attēpt, if he might prouoke her to be his souereigne lady,
promisyng her many gyftes and fayre rewardes, affirmynge farther, y•
if she woulde therunto condiscēd, she myght so fortune of his peramour
and concubyne, to be chaunged to his wyfe &amp; lawfull bedfelow: whiche
demaunde she so wisely, and with so couert speache aunswered and repugned,
affirmynge that as she was for his honor farre vnable to be
hys spouse and bedfelow: So for her awne poore honestie, she was to
good to be either hys concubyne, or souereigne lady: that where he was
a littell before heated with the darte of Cupido, he was nowe set all on
a hote burnyng fyre, what for the confidence that he had in her perfyte
constancy, and the trust that he had in her constant chastitie, &amp; without
any farther deliberacion, he determined with him felfe clerely to marye
with her, after that askyng counsaill of them, whiche he kenwe neither

would nor once durst impugne his concluded purpose.
               
                  BVT the duches of Yorke hys mother letted it as much as in her lay
alledgyng a precontract made by hym with the lady Lucye, and diuers
other lettes: al which doubtes were resolued, &amp; all thinges made clere &amp;
all cauillacions auoyded. And so, priuilie in a mornyng he maried her
at Grafton, where he first phantasied her visage.

quenes bloud was confounded, and vtterly in maner destroyed. So y•
men did afterward diuyne, that either God was not contented, nor yet
pleased with this matrimony, or els that he punished kyng Edward in
his posteritie, for the diepe dissimulynge and couert clokynge, with hys
faithfull frende the erle of Warwycke. But such cōiectures for y• most
part, be rather more of mens phātasies, then of diuine reuelacion. Whē
this mariage was once blowen abrode, forren kynges and prynces maruayled
and musyd at it: noble men detested and dis

                  ither
meete for him beyng a kyng, nor consonant to the honor of so high
an estate. The French kyng and his quene were not a littell discontent
(as I can not blame them) to haue their syster, first demaūded and then
graunted, and in conclusion reiected, and apparantly mocked, without
any cause reasonable. Wherfore shortly to appeseher dolor, thei maried
her to Ihon Galēce, duke of Millayn, where she liued in great felicitie.
But when the erle of Warwycke had perfit knowledge by the letters
of his trusty frendes, that kyng Edward had gotten him a new wyfe, &amp;
that all that he had done with kyng Lewes in his ambassade for the cō
                  ioynyng
of this new affinitie, was both frustrate &amp; vayn, he was earnestly

moued and sore chafed with the chaunce, and thought it necessarye
that king Edward should be deposed from his croune and royal dignitie,
as an inconstant prince, not worthy of such a kyngly office. All men
for the most parte agre, that this mariage was the only cause, why the
erle of Warwycke bare grudge, and made warre on kynge Edwarde.
Other affirme that th
                     •
                  re wer other causes, which added to this, made y•
fyre to flāme, which before was but a litell smoke. For after that kyng
Edward had obteyned his kyngdome (as it was then thoughte) by the
onely helpe and meane of the erle of Warwycke, he begā to suspect▪ yea,
and to doubt him, fearyng, lest he beyng in such aucthoritie and estimacion
of the people, as he well might worke him pleasure or displeasure,
when he therunto were mynded, wherfore he thought it cōueniēt a litle
and a litle to plucke awaye and minyshe the power and aucthoritie,
which he and his predecessors had gyuen to the erle, to thentent that he
then myght do at his pleasure, bothe at home and in outward parties,
without feare or dread, without checke or taunt, whatsoeuer to his awn
mynde semed most conuenient. By this a man may se that often it chaū
                  ceth,
that frendes for one good turne will not render another, nor yet remember
a great gratuite and benefite in time of necessitie, to thē shewed
and exhibited: But for kyndnes they shew vnkindnes, &amp; for great benefites
receyued, with great displeasure they do recompense. Of thys the
erle of Warwycke was nothyng ignorāt, which although he loked for
better thankes &amp; more ample benefites at kyng Edwardes handes: yet
he thought it best to dissimule the matter, tyll such a time were come, as
he might fynd the kyng without strēgth, and then to imbrayd him with
the pleasure that he had done for him.The displeasure betwene kīg Edward the .iiii. &amp; the erle of Warwycke. And farther it erreth not from y•
treuth that kynge Edward did attempt a thyng once in the erles house
which was much agaynste the erles ho
                     •
                  estie (whether he woulde haue
deflowred hys doughter or his nece, y• certayntie was not for both their
honors openly knowen) for surely such a thyng was attempted by king
Edward, which loued well both to loke and to fele fayre dammosels.
But whether the iniury that the erle thought he had taken at king Edwardes
handes, or the disdayne of aucthoritie that the erle had vnder
the king, was the cause of dissolucion of their amitie and league, trueth
it is that the priuie intencions in their hartes brake into so many smal
peces, that England, Fraunce, and Flaunders, could neuer ioyne them
agayn, duryng their naturall lyfes.
               
                  THE erle of Warwycke beyng thus moued, inflāmed, &amp; set against
the kyng▪ lest in his fury, his purpose might be espied and broughte to
nought, determined him self, couertly dissimulyng, so longe to suffer all
such wronges &amp; iniuries, as were to hym done, til he might spye a tyme
conueniēt, &amp; a world after hys awn appetite, for the setting furth of his
enterprise, and accompilshyng of his purpose: wherupon he sayled into
England, and with reuerence saluted the kyng as he was wont to do, &amp;
declared his Ambassade and thexployt of thesame, without any spot of

grudge to be perceyued, as though he were ignorant of the new matrimony.
And when he had taryed in the c

                  urte a certayn space, more for
to shewe that he was thesame person, and of thesame good mynde towarde
the kynge, as he was before the tyme of hys legacion, then for
any great affeccion that he bare, either to the kyng or the quene, he obteyned
licence of the kyng, to depart to hys Castel of Warwycke, both
for hys health and recreacion, whither with great honour he was accō
                  panied
with diuers of the kynges familier seruitors, as thoughe none
inward grudge or couert dissimulacion had ben hydden betwene them,
where he remayned tyll all hys priuie imaginacions were made open,
and all hys enterprises were ready to be set forwarde. Duryng whiche

lady of excellent beautie, and yet more of womanhod then beautie, and
more of vertue then womanhode, whose innumerable good qualities,
beside the giftes of nature, grace and fortune, were so seriously setfurth

king sayd he wolde aske counsail, &amp; so calling to hym the Cōstable and
Marshall with the officers of armes, after longe consultacion had, and
lawes of armes rehersed, it was declared to the bastarde for a sentence
diffinitiue by the duke of Clarence, then Constable of Englande, and
the duke of Northfolke Erle Marshall, that if he woulde prosecute
farther his attempted chalenge, he muste by the lawe of armes, be deliuered

when he was taken from hym, that is to saye, the poynt of the lord Scales
axe to be fixed in the sighte of his healme, as depe as it was when
they were seuered. The bastard heryng this iudgemt, doughted muche
the sequele, if he so should procede agayne, wherefore he was content to
relinquyshe hys chalenge, rather then to abyde the hasarde of hys dishonour:
Other chalenges were done, &amp; valiaūtly achened by the Englishmen,
which I passe ouer. When all these corragious actes were
thus with ioy accomplished, sorowfull tidinges were broughte to the
bastard, that duke Philip his father was passed this transitory lyfe, of

whiche tidinges he was not a littell sorowfull, and therevpon takynge
his leue of kynge Edwarde and his syster, the newe Duches of Burgoyne,
liberally rewarded with plate and Iuels, with all celeritie he
returned to the new duke Charles his nephew, accōpting to him what

to the great contentacion and accomplishement of the desire of the said
Duke, and thereof most hartely thanked the lady for her consent, as for
the thynge that he most desired, not forgettynge to gratefie kynge Edwardes

the incredible faythefulnes, the secrete sobernes, and the polytique
prudence that I haue euer by long cōtinuāce of tyme experimented
in you both, doth not onely encourage my harte, yea and setteth me
in great hope of obteynynge my purpose, but also putteth me out of all

Surely, I woulde in no wise that you shoulde thynke that, that whiche

Kyng Henry is, a Godly, good, and a verteous persone, neither forgettyng
his frendes, nor puttyng in obliuion any benefite by hym, of a
meane persone receiued, nor yet any paine for his causes susteined, he
hath lefte vnrewarded: To whom God hath sent a sonne, called Prince
Edward, borne to bee of great worthynes and prayse, of muche bountefulnes
and liberalitie, of whom men maie, many laudable thynges coniecture,
consideryng the pein, labor, and trauaill, that he taketh to helpe
his father out of captiuitie and thraldome. Kyng Edward on the contrary
side, is a man, cōtumelious, opprobrious, &amp; an iniurious person,
to them that deserue kyndnes, he sheweth vnkyndnes, and to theim that
loue him, he dedly hateth, now detestyng to take any pein, for the preferment
or maintenaunce, of the publique wealth of this realme, but al geuen
to pastime, pleasure, and daliance. Soner preferryng to high estate,
men discended of lowe bloud, and basse degree, then men of old and vndefiled
houses, whiche hath bothe supported hym, &amp; the common wealth
of his realme: So that now I perceiue, that it is euē come to this poynt
that he will destroye all the nobilitie, or els the nobilitie must shortly, of

very necessitie destroye and confounde hym. But reason would, that we
that wer first hurt, should first reuēge our cause: for it is not vnknowen
to you bothe, how that he, immediatly after he had obteined the croune,
began first secretly, and then openly, to enuie, disdain, and impugne the
fame, glory, and renoune, of our house and familie, as who saied, that al
the honor, preferment, and aucthoritie that we haue, we had onely receiued
at his handes, and that we had neither obteigned, dignitie nor rule
by our great labor, aide and trauaill. Whiche to a
                     •
                  l men maie seme vntrue,
whiche consider that our name, chief title, and principall aucthoritie,
was to vs geuen by kyng Henry the sixte, and not by hym. But if euery
man will remembre, who firste toke parte with his father, when he
claimed the Croune: who at that tyme, for that cause was in greate ieoperdie,
and almost slain by the kynges meniall seruauntes, and who neuer
lefte this man in prosperitie nor aduersitie, till he had the garlande,
and the realme in quietnes, shall manifestly perceiue, that wee and oure
bloudde, hath shewed our selfes more like fathers to hym, then he like a
frend to vs. If we haue receiued any benefites of hym, surely thei be not
so muche, as wee haue deserued, nor so muche as we looked for, and yet
thei bee muche more, then he would wee should inioye, as ye bothe well
perceiue and knowe. Let these thynges ouerpasse, and speake of the vngentle,
vntrue, and vnprincely handelyng of me, in the laste ambassade,
beyng sent to the French kyng, for to treate a mariage for hym, hauyng
full aucthoritie to bynd and to lose, to contracte and conclude. Whiche
thyng when I had finished and accomplished: how lightly his mynde
chaunged, How priuily he vowed, and how secretly he maried, Bothe
you knowe better then I. So that by this meanes, I was almoste out
of all credence, in the Courte of Fraunce, both with the kyng and quene
as though I had come thether like an espiall, to moue a thyng neuer
mynded, or to treat of a mariage determined before, neuer to take effect.
Whereby the fame of all our estimacion, whiche all kynges and Princes
haue conceiued in vs, partly obteined by the vertue and prowesse of
our noble auncestors, and partly acheued by oure awne peines and forward
actes: shall now bee obfuscate, vtterly extinguished, and nothyng
set by. What worme is touched, and will not once turne again? What
beast is striken, that will not rore or sound? What innocēt child is hurt
that will not crye? If the poore and vnreasonable beastes: If the sely
babes that lacketh discresion, grone against harme to theim proffered,
How ought an honest man to be angery, when thynges that touche his
honestie, be daily against him attempted? But if a meane person in that
case bee angery: how muche more ought a noble man, to fume and stirre
coales, when the high tipe of his honor is touched, his fame in maner
brought to infamy, and his honor almost blemished and appalled, with
out his offence or desert? All this brethren you know to be true, the dishonor
of one, is the dishonor of vs all, and the hurte of one, is the hurte
of all: Wherefore, rather then I will liue vnreuenged, or suffre hym to

reigne, whiche hath sought my decaye and dishonor, I will surely spend
my life, lande, and goodes, in settyng vp that iuste and good man kyng
Henry the sixte: and in deposyng this vntrue, vnfaithfull, and vnkynde
Prince (by our onely meanes) called kyng Edward the fourthe.
               These faire wordes allured the Archbishop shortly, to his intent and
purpose, but the Lorde Marques could by no meanes bee reduced, to
take any parte against kyng Edwarde, till the erl
                     •
                   had bothe promised
hym great rewardes and high promocions, and also assured hym of the
aide and power, of the greatest princes of the realme. Euē as the Marques
vnwillyngly, and in maner coacted gaue his consent, to this vnhappy
coniuracion, at the intisement and procurement of therle, so with
a fainte harte and lesse courage, he alwaies shewed hymself enemie to
Kyng Edwarde▪ excepte in his laste daie: whiche lukewarme harte, and
double dissimulacion, wer bothe the destruccion of him and his brethrē.
The erle of Warwicke beeyng a man of a greate wit, farre castyng, and
many thynges vigilantly foreseyng, either perceiued by other, or had
perfect knowlege of hymself, that the duke of Clarence, bare not the best
will to kyng Edward his brother (as he did not in deede) thought firste
to proue hym a farr of, as it wer in a probleme, and after to open to him
(if he sawe hym flexible to his purpose) the secrete imaginacions of his
stomacke: thynkyng that if he might by pollicie or promise, allure the
duke to his partie, that kyng Edward should be destitute, of one of his
best Hawkes, when he had moste nede to make a flight. So at tyme and
place conuenient, the erle began to complain to the duke, of the ingratitude
and doublenes of kyng Edward, saiyng: that he had neither handled
hym like a frende, nor kepte promise with hym, accordyng as the
estate of a Prince required. The erle had not halfe tolde his tale, but the
duke in a greate fury answered, why my lorde, thynke you to haue hym
kynd to you, that is vnkynd, yea, and vnnatural to me beyng his awne
brother, thynke you that frendship will make hym kepe promise, where
neither nature nor kynred, in any wise can prouoke or moue hym, to fauor
his awne bloud? Thynke you that he will exalte and promote his
cosin or alie, whiche litle careth for the fall or confusiō, of his awne line
and lignage: This you knowe well enough, that the heire of the Lorde
Scales he hath maried to his wifes brother, the heire also of the lorde
Bonuile and Haryngton, he hath geuen to his wifes sonne, and theire
of the lorde Hungerford, he hath graunted to the lorde Hastynges: thre
mariages more meter for his twoo brethren and kynne, then for suche
newe foundlynges, as he hath bestowed theim on: But by swete saincte
George I sweare, if my brother of Gloucester would ioyne with me, we
would make hym knowe, that wee were all three one mannes sonnes, of
one mother and one lignage discended, whiche should be more preferred
and promoted, then straungers of his wifes bloud.
               When therle of Warwicke had hard the dukes wordes, he had that
whiche he bothe sore thrusted and lusted for, and then began boldly to

disclose to the Duke, his intent and purpose euen at the full, requiryng
hym to take parte with hym, and to bee one of the attempted confederacie.
And least the duke might thynke, that the matter was lightly, and
vncircumspectly begon, he declared to hym, how warely, howe secretly,
how spedily all thynges concernyng this purpose, had been compassed,
studied, and forsene, requiryng hym in so greate and vrgente a cause,
bothe to take pein &amp; trauaill, and also to studie with all circumspeccion
and forseyng, how these thynges thus begon might be brought to a certaintie
and a finall conclusion. And the rather to wynne the dukes hart
the erle beside diuerse and many faire promises made to the duke, offered
hym his eldest daughter (beeyng o
                     •
                   ripe age and elegant stature) in
mariage, with the whole halfedele of his wifes inheritaunce. The duke
at the perswasion &amp; request of therle, promised to do all thynges whiche
he would or could, in any maner require or desire. After that the Duke
and the erle had long consulted, concernyng their straunge and dangerous
affaires: thei first determined to saile to Caleis, of the which toune
the erle was chief capitain, where his wife and twoo doughters then soiorned,
whom to visite, the duke of Clarence beyng in amours, had no
small affeccion. But the erle continually remembryng the purpose that
he was set on, thought to begin and kindle the fire, of his vngracious
coniuracion (whiche so many yeres vexed and vnquieted the realme of
Englande) before his departure, wherefore he appoynted his brethren,
the Archebishop and the Marques, that thei should by some meane in
his absence, stirre vp newe commocion or rebellion, in the Countie of
Yorke and other places adiacente: so that this ciuill warre should seme
to all men, to haue been begon without his assent or knowlege (he beyng
in the partes of beyond the sea).
            
            
               The eight yere:The .viii: yere
               
               
                  WHen all these thynges wer thus determined, and in graue
counsaill allowed, the erle and the duke sailed directly to
Caleis: where thei were solempnely receiued, and ioyously
interteined of the Countesse and of her twoo daughters.
And after that the duke had sworne on the Sacrament to
kepe his promise and pacte inuiolate made and concluded with the erle
of Warwicke, he maried the Lady Isabell, eldest daughter to thesaied
erle, in our Lady Churche at Cal
                     •
                  is, with greate pompe and solempnitie.
After whiche mariage so solempnized, the duke and therle consulted
sadly together, by what meanes thei should continue the warre (whiche
as it was by theim appoynted) was recently and within fewe daies begonne
in Yorke shire, not without great rumore and disturbaunce, of all
quietnes in that countrey.
               The mother of this pernicious commocion, was vncharitie, or
very impietie, for there was in the citee of Yorke, an olde and riche
Hospitall, dedicated to Saincte Leonarde, in the whiche Almosehouse

the poore and indigente people were harbored and refreshed, and the
sicke and impotente persones were comforted and healed. For this
good purpose and char
                     •
                  table intent, all the whole Prouince of Yorke,
gaue yerely to this Hospitall certain measures of corne: in maner as an
oblacion of the first fruites of their newe grayne, thynkyng their gyfte
geuen to so holy a place, for so holy an expence, should bee to theim meritorious,
and before God acceptable. Certain euill disposed persones
of the erle of Warwickes faccion, intendyng to set a bruill in the countrey,
perswaded a greate nombre of husbande men, to refuse and deny to
geue any thyng to thesaied Hospitall, affirmyng and saiyng: that the
corne that was geuen to that good intent, was not expended on the pore
people, but the Master of the Hospitall wexed riche with suche almose
and his priestes wexed fat, and the poore people laie leane without succour
of comfort. And not content with these saiynges, thei fell to dooynges,
for when the Proctors of the Hospitall, acc
                     •
                  rdyng to their vsage,
went aboute the countrey, to gather the accustomed corne, thei were sore
beaten, wounded, and very euil intreated. Good men lamented this vngodly
demeanure, and the peruerse people much at it reioysed, and toke
suche a courage, that thei kept secrete conuenticles, and priuie communicaciōs,
in so muche, that within fewe daies, thei had made suche a confederacie
together, that thei wer assembled to the nombre of .xv. thousād
men, euen ready prest to set on the citie of Yorke. When the fame of this
commocion and great assemble, came to the eares of the citizēs of Yorke
thei were firste greatly astonied: but leauyng feare aside, thei were in a
greate doubt and vncertaintie, whether it were best for them to issue out
of their walles, and to geue battaill to the rebelles, or to kepe their citie,
and repulse the violence of their enemies, by the manfull defendyng of
their walles and portes. But the Lorde Marques Montacute, gouernor
and presedent of that countrey for the kyng, did shortly put the citizens
out of all feare and suspicion of inuasion, for he takyng spedy coū
                  saill,
and consideryng the oportunitie of the tyme, with a small nombre
of menne but well chosen, encountered the rebelles, before the gates of
Yorke: where after long conflicte, he toke Robert Huldurne their capitain,
and before theim commaunded his hed there to bee striken of, and
then he caused all his souldiours (because it was darke, to entre into the
citie of Yorke) and after their long labor to refreshe them.
               Here is to be marueiled, why the Marques thus put to death the capitain
and ruler of the people, stirred and reised vp by hym, and the felowes
of his coniuracion and conspiracie: Some saie he did it to the intent,
that he would seme faultes and innocent, of all his brothers doynges,
and priuie imaginacions: But other affirme and saie, that he for
all his promise made to his brother, was then deliberatly determined to
take parte with kyng Edward, with whom (as it shall after appere) he
in small space entered into greate grace and high fauor. The people beyng
nothyng abashed at the death of their capitain, but rather the more

eger and fierse, by faire meanes and craftie perswasions: found the meanes
to get to theim, Henry sonne and heire to the lorde Filz Hughe, and
sir Henry Neuell, sonne and heire of the Lorde Latimer, the one beeyng
nephew, and the other cosin germain to therle of Warwicke. Although
that these young gentlemen, bare the names of capitaines, yet thei had
a tutor &amp; gouernor called sir Ihon Conyers, a man of suche courage &amp;
valiauntnes, as fewe was in his daies, in the Northe partes. And firste
consideryng that thei could not get Yorke, for want of ordinaunce and
artilery, whiche thei did lacke in dede, thei determined with all 
                     •
                  pede to
marche toward Londō, intendyng by the waie to reise suche a phantesie
in the peoples hartes, yt thei should thynke that kyng Edward was neither
a iust prince to God, nor profitable to the cōmon welth of y• realme.
               When kyng Edwarde (to whom all the dooynges of the Erle
of Warwicke, and the Duke his brother, were manifest and ouerte, and
were come to that poynt, that he expected and loked for) was by diuerse
letters sent to hym, certified that the greate armie of the Northren men,
wer with all spe
                     •
                  e commyng toward London. Therefore in greate hast
he sent to Wyllyam lorde Herbert, whom, within twoo yeres before, he
had created erle of Penbroke, that he should without delaye encountre
with the Northren men, with the extremitie of al his power. The erle of
Penbroke, commonly called the lorde Herbert, was not a litle ioyous of
the kynges letters, partly to deserue the kynges liberalitie, whiche of a
meane gentleman, had promoted hym to the estate of an erle, partly for
the malice that he bare to the erle of Warwicke, beyng the sole obstacle
(as he thought) why he obteined not the wardship of the Lorde Bonuiles
daughter &amp; heire, for his eldest sonne. Whervpon he accompaignie
                     •
                  
with his brother sir Richard Harbert, a valiaunt knight, and aboue .vi.
or .vii. thousande Welshemenne well furnished, marched forwarde to
encountre with the Northren men. And to assiste and furnishe hym with
archers, was appoynted Humffray lorde Stafford of Southwike (named,
but not created) Erle of Deuonshire, by the Kyng, in hope that he
valiauntly would serue hym in that iorney, and with hym he had eight
hundred archers. When these twoo Lordes wer met at Cottishold, thei
made diligent inquiry, to here where the Northren menne wer, and so by
their explorators thei were asserteined, that thei were passyng towarde
Northampton, whervpon the lorde Stafford, and sir Richard Harbert
with twoo thousande well horsed Welshmen, saied: thei would go vewe
and se the demeanor and nombre of the Northern men, and so vnder a
w
                     •
                  oddes side, thei couertly espied thē passe forward, and sodainly set on
the rerewarde: but the Northren men with suche agilitie so quickly turned
aboute, that in a moment of an houre, the Welshemen wer clene discomfited
and scatered, and many taken, and the remnaunt returned to
the armie with small gain.
               Kyng Edwarde beeyng nothyng abasshed of this small chaunce,
sente good woordes to the Erle of Pembroke, animatyng and

byddyng hym to bee of a good courage, promisyng hym not alonely
ayde in shorte tyme, but also he hymself in persone royall, would
folowe hym with all his puyssance and power. The Yorke shire menne,
beyng glad of this small victory, were well cooled and went no farther
Southward, but toke their waie toward Warwicke, lokyng for aide of
therle, whiche was lately come from Caleis, with the Duke of Clarēce
his sonne in lawe, and was gatheryng and reisyng of men, to succor his
frendes and kyns
                     •
                  olke. The kyng likewise assembled people on euery
side, to aide and assist therle of Penbroke and his compaignie. But before
or any part receiued comfort or succor, from his frend or partaker,
bothe the armies met by chaunce, in a faire plain, nere to a toune called
Hedgecot, three myle from Banbery,Banbery feld wherin be three hilles, not in equal
distaunce, nor yet in equall quantitie, but liyng in maner although not
fully triangle: the Welshemen gat firste the West hill, hopyng to haue
recouered the East hil: whiche if thei had obteined, the victory had been
theirs, as their vnwise Prophesiers promised thē before. The Northren
men incamped themself on the Southe hill. The erle of Penbroke and
the lorde Stafford of Southwike, wer lodged at Banbery the daie before
the feld, whiche was sainct Iames daie, and there the erle of Pembroke,
putte the Lorde Stafforde out of an Inne, wherein he delighted
muche to be, for the loue of a damosell that dwelled in the house: contrary
to their mutuall agrement by them taken, whiche was, that whosoeuer
obteined first a lodgyng, should not be deceiued nor remoued. After
many greate woordes and crakes, had betwene these twoo capitaines,
the lorde Stafford of Southwyke, in greate dispite departed with his
whole compaignie and band of Archers, leauyng the erle of Pembroke
almoste desolate in the toune, whiche, with all diligence returned to his
host, liyng in the feld vnpurueied of Archers, abidyng suche fortune as
God would sende and prouide. Sir Henry Neuell sonne to the Lorde
Latimer, tooke with hym certain light horssemen, and skirmished with
the Welshemen in the euenyng, euen before their Campe, where he did
diuerse valiaunt feates of armes, but a litle to hardy, he went so farre
forward that he was taken and yelded, and yet cruelly slain: whiche vnmercifull
acte, the Welshemen sore ruied the next daie or night. For the
Northren men beyng inflamed, &amp; not a litle discontented, with the death
of this noble man, in the mornyng valiauntly set on the Welshemenne,
and by force of archers, caused theim quickely to descende the hill into
the valey, where bothe the hostes fought. Therle of Penbroke behaued
hymself like a hardy knight, and expert capitain, but his brother sir Richarde
Herbert so valiauntly acquited hymself, that with his Polleaxe
in his hand (as his enemies did afterward reporte) he twise by fine force
passed through the battaill of his aduersaries, and without any mortall
wounde returned. If euery one of his felowes and compaignions in

the erle of Warwycke, could not here on that syde, but caused the erle &amp;
hys brother with diuers other gentelmē, to the number of .x. to be there
behedded. The Northamptonshire men, with diuers of y• Northernmē
by them procured, in this fury made them a capitayne, and called hym
Robyn of Riddisdale,Robin of Riddesdale. and sodaynly came to the manner of Grafton,
where the erle Ryuers father to the Quene then lay, whome they loued
not, and there by force toke the sayde erle and syr Ihon his sonne, and
brought them to Northampton, and there without iudgement stroke
of their heddes, whose bodyes were solemply enterred in the Blackefreers
at Northampton. When kynge Edward was aduertised of thys
vnfortunate chaūces, he wrote in al hast to the Shiriefes of Somerset
shyre and Deuenshyre, that if they coulde by any meane take the lorde
Stafford of Southwyke, that they vpon payne of their lyues, should
without delay put hym in execucion, whiche accordingly to the kynges
commaundement, after longe exploracion made, founde hym hyd in a
village in Brentmarche, called where he was taken &amp; brought
to Bridgwater, &amp; there cut shorter by the hedde. Thys was the order,Hegecote feld commonly called Banbery
                        •
                      felde.
manner and ende of Hegecot felde, comēly called Banberie felde, foughten
the morow after sainct Iames daye, in the .viij. yere of kynge Edwarde
the .iiii, the whiche battaile euer synce hath bene, and yet is a cō
                  tinuall
grudge betwene the Northernmen and the Welshemen. After
thys battayle the Northernmē resorted towarde Warwycke, where the

erle had gathered a greate multitude of people, whiche erle gaue hygh
commēdacions to syr Ihon Conyers and other capitaynes of y• North,
much reioysing, that they had obteyned so glorious victory, requiring
them to continew as they had begon. The kyng likewyse sore thrusting
to recouer hys losse late susteyned, and desirous to bee reuenged of the
deathes and murders of hys lordes and frēdes, marched toward Warwycke
with a greate armye, and euer as he wente forwarde, his company
increased, because he commaunded it to be noysed and published
to the common people, that his onely entent was to destroy, and vtterly
to confounde the vnhappy stocke and yll graffed generacion, of suche
pernicious persons, as wolde disturbe and bring in thraldome, ye quiet
cōmons and peaseable people. The erle of Warwycke had by his espialles
perfyt, knowlege how the kyng with his armye was bent toward
hym, &amp; sent in all hast possible to the duke of Clarēce (which was not far
from hym with a great power) requyringe hym that bothe their hostes
myghte ioyne in one for as farre as he coulde imagyne, the tyme of
battayle was very nere. The duke hearynge these newes, in good order
of battayle, came and encamped him selfe with the erles host. When all
thynges were redy prepared to fight: by the meanes of frēdes, a meane
was founde how to cōmon of peace, for the whiche, letters were writtē
from eche parte to other, declaring their griefes and the very bottoms
of their stommackes: Herauldes spared no horseflesh in riding betwene
the kyng and the erle, nor in retornynge from the Erle to the kynge: the
kynge conceyuinge a certayne hope of peace in hys awne imaginacion,
toke bothe lesse hede to him selfe, and also lesse fered the outward attēptes
of hys ennemyes, thinkyng and trustynge truely that all thynges
were at a good poynt, and should be well pacified. All the kynges doynges
were by espials declared to the erle of Warwycke, which lyke a
wyse and politique Capitayne entendyng not to lese so great an auantage
to hym geuen, but trustyng to brynge all hys purposes to a fynall
ende and determinacion, by onely obteyning this enterprise: in the dead
of the nyght, with an elect company of men of warre, as secretly as was
possible set on the kynges felde, kylling them that kept the watche, and
or the kynge were ware (for he thoughte of nothynge lesse then of that
chaunce that happened) at a place called Wolney .iiii. myle from Warwycke,Kyng Edward the .iiii. taken prisoner, by y• erle of Warwike
he was takē prysoner, and brought to the Castell of Warwicke.
And to the entent that the kynges frendes myghte not know where he
was, nor what was chaunced of hym, he caused hym by secret iorneys
in the nyght to be conueyed to Myddelham Castell in Yorkeshyre, &amp;
there to be kept vnder the custody of the Archebishop of Yorke his brother,
and other hys trusty frendes, which entertayned the kyng, like his
estate, and serued hym lyke a prynce. But there was no place so farre of
but that the taking of the kyng was shortly knowē there with y• wynde
which newes made many men to feare, and greatly to dread, and many
to wonder and lament the chaūce. Kyng Edward beyng thus in captiuitie,

spake euer fayre to the Archebishop and to the other kepers, (but
whether he corrupted them with money or fayre promises) he had libertie
diuers dayes to go on huntynge,Kyng Edward escaped out of prison. and one day on a playne there met
with hym syr William Stanley, syr Thomas of Borogh, and dyuers
other of hys frēdes, with suche a great bend of men, that neither his kepers
woulde, nor once durst moue him to retorne to prison agayn.
               Thus as you haue harde was kyng Edward deliuered: Some saye
that he was set at large by the erles consent and commaundemente, as
who sayd, I had hym in my kepyng, and myght haue destroyed hym, I
had hym in captiuitie, and so might haue deteyned him, but yet of myne
awne frewill &amp; gentelnes, without pacte or raunsom I am contented to
set him at libertie &amp; to deliuer him. Thys doyng might seme to be some
countenaunce of treuth, if the erle after this had desisted from persecutyng
the warre by hym newly begonne: But for a treuth this good
chaunce happed to kynge Edward, by the yll lucke of kynge Henry, for
surely by this yll fortune a man may playnly cōiecture, that the extreme
poynt of decay of hys house and estate was apparantly at hande, consideryng
that neither by mannes pollicie, nor by worldly riches his vnhappy
predestinate chaunce coulde not by any pollicy be put by, nor by
any instrumēt scraped away (wel such was Goddes pleasure) for if you
consider how that the erle of Warwycke and his frendes, onely to thentent
to ayde, conserue and defende kynge Henry the .vi. haue dispended
their substances, aduentured their lyues, and taken paynes intollerable,
hauyng a sure determinacion, fixed in their myndes, that as long as
kyng Edward lyued, that kyng Henryes faction should neuer prosper
&amp; yet when he was by the Erle taken prisoner, &amp; in captiuitie, he by fortune
escaped, or was wilfully deliuered. By thys you may playnly perceyue
that the lucke of kyng Henry was vnfortunate, and that all that
was done for hym, and in is quarell, euer redouned to hys misfortune
and detriment, euer notyng this, that when thinges contriued &amp; Imagened
come to an vnlucky successe, all the senses of our bodyes be there
by anger, feare or madnes, rauyshed, and in maner distracte from them
selfes. But to retorne to the purpose, when kynge Edward had escaped
the handes of hys enemyes, he went streyghte to Yorke, where he was
with great honor receyued of the Citiezens, and there taried two dayes
to prepare some small army, to accompany hym in hys iorney, but whē
he perceyued that he coulde haue no hoste mete and conuenient to passe
to London, thorough the middes of his enemies (as he was appoynted
to do) he turned from Yorke to Lancaster, where he founde the lord Hastynges
hys Chamberlayne, well accompanyed. He then with y• ayde
of the lord Hastynges, and suche other as drew to hym, beyng well furnished
with spedy iorneys, came safe to his cytye of London.
               When the erle of Warwyke &amp; ye duke of Clarēce, had knowlege how
the kyng by treason of them yt they put in trust, was escaped their handes,
&amp; that in one moment of tyme, all their long studyes and forcastes

were brought to none effect or conclusion, they wexed angrye, &amp; chafed
without measure, &amp; by and by callynge together all their chief frendes
began to consult agayn, of new, &amp; to enquire the estate of their enemies,
to the entent that they might make a beginnyng of a new warre, which
they coniectured to haue taken an ende when the kyng was brought in
to captiuitie. The myndes of these Prynces were much satisfied, &amp; their
corage greatly kindeled, by reason that a great number of men hauing
more pleasure in discord then in concord, louyng better stryfe then vnitie,
offered them selfes to beginne newe warre of their awne desire &amp; request.
Kyng Edward toke euen lyke study for the warres as his ennemyes
dyd, myndinge either to bringe them to conformitie or reason, by
dent of sworde, or els by power of battayle vtterly to destroye &amp; exstirpate
them and their affinitie, to the entent ye
                  ▪ all men might lede a more
quiet lyfe, &amp; lyue in more securitie &amp; rest: for by the sedicious rebellinge
of these persons, the state of the Realme was broughte to great miserie,
for Churches and Temples were euery where robbed &amp; spoiled, houses
burnt, and men slayne in euery place, all the Realme was replenished
with bloud, slaughter, sorow &amp; lamentacion, Cornefeldes were destroied
Cities and Cownes were made desolate and languished with famyn &amp;
dearthe, besyde many other thinges, which happen by the crueltie and
furye of warre and rebellion. This tumult and trouble in the common
wealth of this Realme sore vexed and troubled many, but in especial y•
nobilitie muche lamented and pitied the state of the comminaltie which
with all diligence rode betwene the kyng, the Erle and the Duke to reconsile
thē eche to other, and to cōclude a perfect peace &amp; amitie, requiring
them rather more to remēber the benefites, that euerye of thē haue
receyued of other, then to sette forth the vngratitude or iniury, whiche
one hath done to the other, which is rather the occasion of discord, then
the meane to come to amitie. Further, they exhorted theym rather to deserue
the loue of all men, by keping of peace &amp; v
                     ••
                  e, then by fightinge
and intestine warre to destroy the Realme, and wynne the hatred &amp; malice
of all the nacion: for as he is vnkynd and vnnaturall, that will not
cherishe hys natural parentes and procreators, much more vnnatural
and wicked are they, which will suffer their natyue coūtrey, beyng their
common father and mother, by their contencion &amp; stryfe to be brought
to decay and vtter perdicion. The aucthoritie first of the nobilitie of
the Realme, and secondarely their charitable mocion, so mytigated the
myndes, bothe of the kyng, the Duke and the erle, that eche gaue fayth
to other to go and come, sauely without ieopardy. In whiche promise
the Duke &amp; Erle, hauing perfight trust and cōfidēce, came both to Lō
                  don,
accompanied with to small a number of men, in comparison to the
great dangier that they were in. And at Westmynster, the kyng, the
Duke and the Erle had a longe communicacion together, 
                     •
                  or some end
to be taken or made betwene them: But they fell at such great wordes
with such exprobracions, and opening: either of olde benefites shewed

or of olde ingratitudes receiued, that in a great furye, without any cō
                  clusion
they departed, the kyng to Canterbury, and the Duke and the
Erle to Warwycke, where the Erle of Warwycke prepared a new host
to ryse in Lyncolnshire, and made there of capitayne syr Robert Welles,
sonne to Rychard lord Welles, an experte man in armes, and very
pollitique in warre.
               These newes sodaynly brought to the kynge, did not a littell vexe &amp;
tykil hym, because he euer feruētly hoped, that his aduersaryes wolde
rather come to some honest condiciōs of cōcorde, then so temerariously
and so sodaynly renouate the warre. And the more rumor yt was sprede
(contrary to his expectacion) of this new begonne battayll, the soner he
gathered together an host for the resistence of thesame, and out of hand
he sent to Rychard lord Welles, willing him vpon the sight of his letters
with all hast to repayre vnto hym, which oftentymes he had excused
by syckenes and debilitie of his body. But when that excuse serued
not, he thynkyng to purge him selfe sufficiently before the kynges presence,
toke with hym syr Thomas Dymocke, which had maried his syster,
and so together came to Londō. When he was come vp, his frēdes
certefied hym that the kynge was with hym not a littell displeased, but
highly discontented. Wherfore for verye feare, he with hys brother in
law toke the sentuarie at Westmynster, entendynge there to abyde tyll
the prynces Ire were somwhat asswaged and mitygate. Kyng Edward
which thought to pacifie all thys besy tumulte, withoute anye farther
bloudshed, promisyng both those persons their pardons, caused theim
vpon hys promise to come out of Sentuary to hys presence, and callyng
to hym the lorde Welles, willed hym to write to syr Robert hys
sonne to leaue of the warre, and not to take the Erles parte. And in the
meane season, he wyth hys army went forward towarde hys enemyes,
hauynge with hym the lorde Welles, and syr Thomas Dymocke, and
beynge not past two dayes iorney from Stāford, where hys enemyes
had pytched their felde, had perfyt knowlege that syr Robert Welles
nothyng moued with hys fathers letters, styl kept his campe, abyding
the kyng and his power. The kynge hauyng hygh indignacion at hys
presumpcion and mynded to be reuenged in parte, cōtrary to his faith
and promise caused the lord Welles, father to the saide syr Robert, and
syr Thomas Dymocke to be behedded there, to the terrible example of
of other, which shal put their confidēce in the promise of a prince. Whē
syr Robert Welles hard that the kyng drew nere, and that hys father &amp;
syr Thomas Dymocke ware behedded, he stode firste in a greate perplexitie, studyeng whither he should gyue battail or no, because it was
bothe perilous and doughtfull to fight with so great an armye, before
the erle of Warwycke with hys power were assembled, but yet hauyng
a yonge and a lusty courage, and with manly boldnes stimulate, and
pricked forward, he set on hys enemyes.
               The battayle was sore fought on bothe partes, &amp; many a man slayne

And in conclusion, whyle syr Robert was exhortyng and prouokynge
hys men to tary, which were in maner disconfit, and redy to flye, he was
enuyroned and beset aboute with hys enemyes, and so was taken, and
with hym syr Thomas Delaund knyght, and many mo. After hys takyng,
the Lyncolnshyre men amased, threw away their coates, the lighter
to runne away, and fled, and therfore this battayl is yet there called
Losecote felde.
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   The kyng, glad of this victory, commaunded out of
hand syr Robert Welles and diuers other, to be put to execuciō in thesame
place. The fame was, that at this battayll were slayne .x.M. men
at the least.
               The erle of Warwycke lay at this tyme at his Castell of Warwycke,
and was cominge with a houge host the nexte day towarde his
armye in Lyncolneshyre, but when he hard saye that they had foughte
soner then he thought either they could or woulde, and that hys partye
was ouerthrowen and vanquyshed: Although he might now be discoraged,
yet he thought it necessary to dissimule the cace, because oftentymes
in battayles, vayn thinges be regarded before trew, and to thentēt
to comfort certayn of his company (beyng in dispayre, and redy to flee)
both in woorde and dede, he conscribed and prepared a new host, and
with all the studye and industrye, that he coulde practise or vse, he imagened
how to compasse Thomas lord Stanley, which had maried hys
syster, that he might be one of the confederacy and coniuracion: whyche
thynge when he coulde not bryng to passe, for the lord Stanley hadde
aunswered him plainly, that he woulde neuer make warre against kīg
Edwarde, he thought to spende no lenger tyme in waste, and mistrustyng
that he was not able to mete with hys enemyes, he with the Duke
of Clarence hys sonne in lawe, departed to Exceter, and there taryenge
a few dayes, and perceyuynge that all thynges lacked, whiche
were apt and necessary for the warre, determined to sayle to kyng Loys
the French kyng, to renew the familier acquayntaunce, whiche he had
with hym when he was there of Ambassade, for the mariage of kynge
Edward as you haue hard, hauyng a sure cōfidence and hope, either to
haue a great ayde of the Frenche kyng, or els to incense hym earnestly
to make battayll agaynst kyng Edwarde. And restyng vpon this
opinion, they hyred shippes at Dartmouth in Deuonshyre, well armed,
and at all poyntes trymmed and decked. And when wynde and
wether serued theym, the Duke and the Erle with their wyues, and a
great number of seruauntes, plucked vp the sayles, &amp; toke their waye
fyrst toward Caleys, where the erle of Warwycke was chefe capitayn,
and thought there to haue left hys wyfe and doughters, tyll he had returned
out of Fraunce.
            
            
               The .ix. yere.
               
                  
                  WHen the erle of Warwicke thus fled out of England,The .ix. yere▪
                   the
yere of our Lorde was iust .1470. and the yere of Kyng
Edwardes reigne was then .ix. This sodain departyng
of kyng Edwardes aduersaries, did not onely vexe and
bite hym at the very stomacke, but also did stimulat and
quicken hym to loke the more diligently to his affaires,
and busines, and especially, because that the absence of the erle of Warwicke,
made the common people daily more and more, to long and bee
desirous to haue the sight of hym, and presētly to behold his personage.
For thei iudged that the Sunne was clerely taken from the worlde,
when he was absent: In suche high estimaciō emongest the people, was
his name, that neither no one manne, thei had in so muche honor, neither
no one persone, thei so muche praised, or to the Cloudes so highly extolled.
What shall I saie? His onely name sounded, in euery song, in the
mouthe of the common people, and his persone was represented with
greate reuerence, when publique plaies, or open triumphes should bee

                     •
                  hewed, or set furthe abrode in the stretes: whiche hartie fauor, was the
apparant occasion why his faccion and compaignie, within a fewe dayes,
merueilously increased and augmented. For the whiche cause, the
kyng was vexed with a double mischief, for he doubted muche, whom
he should moste feare of twoo, either the familier enemies abidyng at
home, or the extrauagant fooes, lyngeryng beyonde the sea: But chiefly
he prouided, but very 
                     •
                  lackly, to withstande the erle of Warwickes landyng.
And first he wrote to Charles duke of Burgoyn, whiche had maried
the lady Margaret his suster, to helpe that therle nor his compaignie,
should haue neither aide nor refuge, in any part of his, nor his frē
                  des
territories or dominions. These tidynges were ioyfull to the duke
of Burgoyne, as to hym whiche (accordyng to the olde prouerbe) hated
the erle of Warwicke, worse then the curre dogge, or serpent: partly, because
he was the ouerthrower and confounder, of the house of Lancastre,
of the whiche, the erle was linially discended, by the duches his mother
partly because therle had suche high offices, and was so renoumed
in Englande, that kyng Edward the dukes brother in lawe, might not
do liberally all thynges in his realme, as he hymself would (whiche the
duke estemed to be a greate bondage.) And partly, because the erle with
stoode with all his power and might, the conclusion of the mariage, betwene
the kynges suster and thesaid duke. But the chief rancor was, because
the erle of Warwicke, fauored the Frenche kyng, whom the duke
loued not, for at his last beeyng in Fraunce, he promised the Frenche
kyng to be frende to his frendes, and vtter enemie to his fooes and aduersaries.
This roted hatered, and cankarde malice, whiche the Duke
bare to the Erle, caused hym to attempte mo displeasures, and to inuent
mo mischiefes against therle, then either kyng Edward could imagyn,
or was of the Duke required (as you shall plainly perceiue, by the sequele
of this historie.
               
                  Now let vs speake of the erle of Warwickes doynges, whiche muste
nedes plaie a pagtaunt in this enterlude, or els the plaie wer at apoynt.
The erle as you haue hard before, sailed from Dartmouth toward Caleis▪
where he was capitain generall, and with a prosperous wynd came
before the toune, in whiche fortresse was deputie for the erle, the Lorde
Uaw
                     •
                  lere a Gascoyne, beside diuerse of therle of Warwickes seruauntes,
whiche bare great offices and aucthorities in the toune. This Uaw
clere, whether he did it by dissimulacion, or bearyng his good mynde to
kyng Edward (as by the sequele hereof, I doubte whether he did or no)
In stede of receiuyng of his master with triumphe, he bent and discharged
against hym, diuerse peces of ordinaunce, sendyng hym worde, that
he should there take no lande. This nauie liyng thus before Caleis at
ancre,The Duches of Clarēce deliuered of a soonne vpon the sea, before the toune of Caleis. the duches of Clarence, was there deliuered of a faire sonne, whiche
child, therles deputie vnneth would suffre to be christened within ye
toune, nor without greate intreatie, would permit twoo flagons of wine
to bee conueighed aborde, to the ladies liyng in the hauen. This was a
greate rigor and extremitie, for the seruaunt to vse against the Master,
or the inferior to vse against the superior, wherefore the erle hoped, and
nothyng lesse mistrusted, then to be assured and purueyed in that place,
whiche is the greatest treasure, that belongeth to Englande, and the fairest
capitainship of the worlde, at the least in Christendom. But he was
fain to kepe the seas, without comfort of aide, of any of his seruauntes.
The Kyng of Englande was quickely aduertised, of the refusall that
Mōsire de Uaw
                     •
                  lere, made to his capitain therle of Warwicke, whiche
manful doyng, so muche pleased the kyng, that incōtinent he made hym

                     •
                  hier capitain of the toune of Caleis, by his letters patentes, whiche he
sent to him out of hand, and therof discharged clerely therle, as a traitor
and a rebell. Duke Charles of Burgoyn, liyng at sent Homers (whiche
would nedes haue an ower, in the erle of Warwickes boate) beyng aduertised
also, of Monsire de Uawcleres refusall made of his Master,
sent to hym his trustie seruaunt, Philip de Commines (whiche wrote al
these doynges in a Chronicle) and gaue to hym yerely a thousand crounes
in pencion, (a small reward God wotte, for so high a seruice, as vntruly
to kepe his Master from his office) praiyng and requiryng hym,
to continue in truth and fidelitie, toward kyng Edward, as he had shewed
and begonne. The messenger founde hym so towarde and of suche
conformitie, that he was content to sweare in his presence, truly to take
kyng Edwardes part against all men, and onely to his vse to kepe and
defend the strong toune of Caleis. But thesaied Phillip de Commines
sore mistrusted Monsire de Uawclere, because he sent worde to the erle
of Warwicke priuily, liyng at whitsandbay, that if he landed he should
be taken and lost: for al England (as he said) toke part against hym, the
duke of Burgoin and all thinhabitantes of the toune, wer his enemies,
the Lorde Duras the kynges Marshall, and all the retinue of the garrison
wer his aduersaries: so that for a finall conclusion, his onely sauegarde

and comforte, were to withdrawe hym and his compaignie into
Fraunce, where he knewe he should bee highly receiued &amp; better welcomed,
&amp; as for the toune of Calice, he should take no thought, for thesaid
Monsire de Uawclere, promised thereof to make hym a good reconyng,
when tyme and opportunitie should serue. This counsaill was profitable
to the erle of Warwicke, but not to the kyng of Englande, and lesse
pleasant to the duke of Burgoyn: which princes might very well thynk
bothe the office of the Capitainship of Caleis, and the pēcion of the .M
crounes (if it wer paied) on suche a depe dissimuler, to be euill employed.
               The erle of Warwicke, as he was bothe before his departure out of
Englande determined, and also now by Monsire de Uawclere, newly
counsailed and aduised, with his nauie sailed toward Normandy, and
in the meane waie, robbed, spoyled, and tooke many riche shippes, of the
Duke of Burgoyns countreys (whiche sore netteled the duke, and caused
hym to prepare a strong and a greate armie on the sea, to take therle
prisoner, as he returned homeward) &amp; at the last with all his nauie and
spoyle, he tooke lande at Depe in Normandy, where the gouernor of the
countrey for the Frenche kyng, frendely welcomed hym, and louyngly
hym entertained, certifiyng kyng Lewes of his landyng and arriuall.
               Kyng Lewes a greate ceason before, had so muche merueiled at
the publique fame and common renoume, of the noble actes and high
prowes, of the Erle of Warwike, that he thought nothyng might
more pleasauntly happe, or chaunce towarde hym, then to haue a
cause or occasion to hym ministered, wherby he might do the Erle some
profite or pleasure. Whiche long lust accordyng to his desire, was now
likely to take effecte, to his contentacion, and the erles greate commoditie:
wherefore beyng ioyous of his landyng in France, he sent vnto hym
certain Princes, whiche declared to hym on the Kynges behalf, that as
the kyng had long tyme sought waies and meanes, how to do hym plesure,
aide and comfort: So seyng that now the tyme was come, that the
Erle had necessitie of all those thynges, he assured hym that he would
neither forget hym, nor yet desist to do for him any thyng, whiche might
be consonaunt to his louyng request, or frendly desire: requiryng hym
with the duke his sonne in law, to take pein to come to his castle of Amboys,
set on the Riuer of Leyre: affirmyng y•thei should neither lose their
labor, nor thynke their iorney to haue euill successe in the conclusion.
               When Duke Charles knewe that therle was landed in Normandie,
he sent in all hast a Poste to Kyng Lewes, with whom he was then ioyned
in a league, requiryng hym neither to help with men nor money, the
erle of Warwicke, nor the Duke of Clarēce, open enemies to kyng Edwarde,
his felowe, frende, and brother in lawe, and his perpetuall alye
and trustie confederate, addyng therto sharpe woordes and minatorie
saiynges, if he would in any case, be to them a refuge or succor.
               The Frenche kyng did not onely contempne his proude wordes, and
laughed at his manacyng and blode braggyng, but soberly answered,

that without enfringyng of any league or treatie, he lawfully might &amp;
would helpe his frendes, and in especiall suche, whiche by their desertes,
bee aboue other renoumed and extolled: Of whiche nombre, he affirmed
therle of Warwicke to be one, whiche thyng if he did, he saied: it should
be neither cost, charge, nor burthen to the Duke of one blancke, nor put
hym to the pein of a moment of an houre. When the duke had certified
the kyng of Englande of this answer, he was sodainly in a dompe, and
began seriously to immagyne, who were his frendes, and who were his
foes, and apprehended some, whom he thought gyltie, began with them
to question, who were frendes to his enemis: and of their coniuracion
(which was the occasion that many fearyng themselfes, fled vnto Sanctuary)
and many trustyng the kynges pardon, submitted and yelded
theimself to the Kynges clemencie. Emongest whom, Ihon Marques
Montacute, humbly yelded hymself, and vowed to bee euer true to the
kyng (as he had doen before tyme) whom he with muche humanitie and
faire woordes, did receiue and intertain, to the intent to flecte and allure
the hartes of other men, to ioyne and knit with hym, against all hostilitie
and vtter enemies.
               While these thynges were thus treated in Englande, therle of Warwicke
and the Duke of Clarence, rode with greate pompe toward Amboyse,
where the Frenche kyng laie, and by the way the people gathered
and in greate nombre flocked, to se and beholde with their iyes, the persone
and visage of hym, of whose valiant actes and wonderfull dooynges,
their eares haue many tymes been fulfilled and replenished. Whē
he came to the kynges presence, he was with all kyndes of curtesie and
humanitie receiued and welcomed: To whom by long tracte of tyme,
he declared the causes &amp; consideracions, of his commyng into Fraunce.
Kyng Lewes aswell hauyng nowe delectacion, with the presence of his
frende as he was accustomed to reioyse and bee ioyous, when he harde
either laude or praise of hym in his absence: promised hym his power,
his riches, and all thynges that he might or could doo, to helpe hym in
his trouble, and to refreshe hym in his aduersitie.
               When Quene Margarete, whiche soiorned with Duke Reyner her
father, called kyng of Scicile. &amp;c. Harde tell that the erle of Warwicke
and the Duke of Clarence, had abandoned Englande, and wer come to
the Frenche Courte: hopyng of newe comfort, with all diligence came to
Amboyse, with her onely sonne Prince Edward. And with her came Iasper
erle of Penbroke, and Ihon erle of Oxenford, whiche after diuerse
long imprisonmentes lately escaped, fled out of Englande into Fraunce
and came by fortune to this assemble. After that thei hadlong cōmoned,
and debated diuerse matters, concernyng their suretie and wealthe, thei
determined by meane of the Frenche kyng, to conclude a league and a
treatie betwene them: And first to begin with all, for the more sure foundacion
of the newe amitie, Edward Prince of Wales, wedded Anne second
daughter to therle of Warwicke, whiche Lady came with her mother

into Fraunce. This mariage semed very staunge to wise men, consideryng
that that the erle of Warwicke, had first disherited the father,
and then to cause his sonne, to mary with one of his daughters, whose
suster the duke of Clarence before had maried, which was euer extreme
enemie to the house of Lancastre: wherevpon thei d
                     •••
                  ned that the mariage
of the Prince, should euer be a blot in the Dukes iye, or the mariage
of the Duke, a mote in the iye of the Prince, eche of them lokyng to
be exalted, when therle on hym smiled: and eche of them again thinkyng
to be ouer throwen, when the erle of hym lowred. After this mariage, the
duke and therles toke a solempne othe, that thei should neuer leaue the
warre, vntill suche tyme as kyng Henry the sixt, or the prince his sonne,
were restored to the full possession and Diademe of the realme: and that
the Quene and the Prince, should depute and appoynt the Duke and
the erle, to be gouernors and conseruators, of the publique wealthe, till
suche tyme as the Prince were come to mannes estate, and of habilitie
meete and conuenient, to take vpon hym so high a charge, and so greate
a burden. There were many other condicions concluded, whiche bothe
reason, &amp; the weightines of so great a busines, required to be setforward
               While these Lordes wer thus in the Frenche Courte, there landed at
Caleis a damosell, belongyng to the Duches of Clarence (as she saied)
whiche made Monsire de Uawclere beleue, that she was sent from kyng
Edward to the erle of Warwicke, with a plain ouerture and declaraciō
of peace. Of the whiche tidynges, Uawclere was very glad for the erles
sake, whom he thought (by this peace) to bee restored to all his old possessions,
romes and dignities. But he was sore by this damosel deceiued
for her message (as it after proued) was the beginnyng of the erles confusion.
For she perswaded the Duke of Clarence, that it was neither naturall,
nor honorable to hym, either to condiscende or take parte, against
the house of Yorke (of whiche he was lineally discended) and to set vp again
the house of Lancastre, whiche lignage of the house of Yorke, was
not only by the whole Parliament of the realme, declared to be the very
and indubitate heires of the Kyngdome: but also kyng Henry the sixte
and his bloud affirmed thesame, and therevpon made a composicion,
whiche of record appereth. Farthermore she declared, that the mariage
with therles daughter with Prince Edward, was for none other cause,
but to make the Prince kyng, and clerely to extingishe all the house of
Yorke, of whom the duke hymself was one, and next heire to the croune,
after his eldest brother and his children. These reasons, and the mariage
of the Prince to the Erles daughter, so sancke in the Dukes stomacke,
that he promised at his returne, not to be so an extreme enemie to
his brother, as he was taken for, whiche promise afterwarde, he did not
forget. With this answere the dampsell departed into Englande, therle
of Warwicke therof beyng clerely ignoraunt.
               When the league was concluded (as you before haue harde) the
Frenche kyng lent them shippes, money, and men, and that thei mighte

the surer saile into Englande, he appoynted the Bastard of Burgoyn,
Admirall of Fraunce with a greate nauie, to defende the
                     •••
                   against the
armie of the Duke of Burgoyne, whiche was stronger then bathe the
Frenche kynges nauie, or the Englishe flete. Kyng Reyner also did help
his daughter, to his smal power, with menne, and muni
                     •
                  ions of warre.
When this armie (whiche was not small) was conscribed and come together
to Harflete, at the mouthe of the riuer of Seyne, expectyng wind
and wether. The Erle of Warwicke receiued letters out of Englande,
that men so muche daily and hourely, desired and wished so sore his arriuall
and returne, that almoste all men were in harnesse, lokyng for his
landyng: wherefore he was required to make hast, yea, hast more then
hast, although he brought no succor with hym. For he was farther assured,
that assone as he had once taken lande, there should mete hym many
thousandes (as after it proued in deede) to doo hym what seruice or
pleasure, thei could or might: all this was the offer of the cōmon people.
Beside this, diuerse noble men wrote, to help hym with mē, harnesse, money,
and all thynges necessary for the warre: beside their awne persones,
whom thei promised to aduenture in his querell. When therle had receiued
these letters, he not a litle regardyng suche an offre, and so many
greate benefites to hym, euen at hande apparauntly proffered, fully determined
with the Duke, and th
                     •
                   e
                     •
                  les of Oxenford and Penbroke (because
Quene Margaret and her sonne, were not fully yet furnished for
suche a iorney) to go before with part of the nauie, and part of tharmie,
and to attempt the first brunte of fortune and chaunce, whiche if it well
succeded, then should Quene Margerete and her soonne, with the residue
of the nauie and people followe into Englande. The Erle of Warwicke
thynkyng this weightie matter, not worthy to be ly
                     •
                  gered, but
to be accelerate with al diligence possible, takyng his leue of the Frēche
kyng Lewes, geuyng hym no small thankes, bothe on the behal
                     •
                  e of
kyng Henry, and also for his awne parte, and so beyng dismissed, came
where his nauie laye at Anker, commaundyng his men to go on shippe
borde myndyng to take his course toward Englande.
               The Duke of Burgoyn whiche was not content, that therle of Warwicke
and his compaignie, was succored and aided of the French kyng
against his brother in lawe kyng Edward of Englande, to withstande
that armie, and to take therle o
                     •
                   Warwicke prisoner, if it were possible.
He prepared suche a greate nauie, as lightly hath not been sene before,
gathered in maner of all nacions, whiche armie laie at the mouthe of
Seyne, ready to fight with therle of Warwicke, when he should set out
of his harborowe.
               Se the worke of God, thesame night before therle departed, ther rose
suche a sodain wynde and a terrible tempest, that the dukes shippes wer
scatered one from another, some drouned, some wether driuen into Scotlande,
so that two of them wer not in compaignie together, in one place,
In the mornyng next folowyng, the wether wexed faire, and the wynde

prosperous, wherupō in hope of a bone voiage, the Erle and his company
halsed vp their sayles, and with good spede lāded at Dartmouth
in Deuonshyre, from which place he passed into Fraūce, almost the .vj.
monethe, last passed.
               Before this tyme the duke of Burgoyne Charles, which more hated
the Erle of Warwycke, and enuied his prosperitie, then he loued kyng
Edward, sauyng for his ayde y• he trusted of in tyme of necessitie, wrote
to kynge Edwarde, bothe of the doynges of the erle of Warwycke in
Fraunce, and of hys armye and power, and also certefied hym by hys
trusty seruaūtes of the place, where the Erle purposed with all his people
to take lande, kynge Edward passed litle on the matter, trustynge
to much to the mouable commons of his Realme, and without anye army
layd, either to kepe the Erle from landyng, either to encoūtre wyth
hym at the first arryuall, to the e
                     •
                  tent that his frēdes should not draw
in hepes to hym for hys strength left all purueiance for defēce alone, &amp;
rode on huntyng, Hawkyng, and vsing all maner of pastimes, with Ladyes
and Damosels, for his disport and solace that coulde be imagened
or inuented. When the erle of Warwycke had taken lāde, he made
a Proclamation in the name of kyng Henry the .vi. vpon high paynes,
commaunding and charging all men apt, or able to bere armour, to prepare
them selfs to fight against Edward duke of Yorke, which contrarye
to al right, Iustice and law, had vntrewly vsurped the Croune and
Imperial dignite of this realme. It is almost incredible to thinke how
sone the fame of the erles landyng was blowen ouer, and thorow al the
whole Realme, and how many thousand men of warre, at the very first
tidinges of his landing, were sodaynly assembled and set forwarde to
welcome him. When he was thus, according to hys desire, fully furnished
on euery syde with his kynred &amp; frendes, he toke his way towarde
London, where he iudged and faythfully beleued, to fynde more open
frendes then priuie enemies, or cancard hartes.
               When kyng Edward knew of the Erles landynge, and of the great
repayre of people, that to him incessantly without intermission dyd resorte,
he then began to thynke on his busines, and studied how to fynd
a remedy for a mischief. (but this was to late) And first he wrote to the
Duke of Burgoyne, requyring hym to haue a vigylant eye to the sea,
and so to se the stremes kept and scoured with his nauie, that the Erle
neither should nor might returne agayn into Fraunce, if he shoulde be
agayne propulsed out of the Realme. And as for the doynges in Englande
he bad let hym alone, for he was both of puissance and abilitie,
sufficient to ouercome and defende al his enemies and rebelles, within
his awne Realme and countrey. This saiyng littel or nothing pleased
the duke of Burgoynes messengers, for they thought that it had bene
muche more profitable to kyng Edward, to haue circumspectly forsene
afore, and prouided to stoppe his landyng, then now sodaynly to abide
the fortune of battayle, which is euer dubious and vncertayne. Kynge

Edward accompanyed with the duke of Glocester his brother the lord
Hastynges his Chamberleyn, which had maried the Erles sister, &amp; yet
was euer trew to the kyng his Master, and the lord Scales brother to
the Quene, sent out curriers to al his trustye frendes, for the fornyture
of able persons, mete for the warre, and conueniente for the defence of
his awne royall person, entending if he might by any pollicie or subtill
engyn to circūuent or trappe the erle of Warwycke, knowing perfitly
that if he had once mastred the chief belwether, the flocke wolde sone be
dispercled.
               Of them that were sent for, fewe in effect came, and yet more came
then were willyng, and more came willingly then were betrusted, some
came for feare, and some muche doughted to come, but the greatest
heddes wynked and sayd they could not, but they ment they would not
come. kyng Edward beyng in this perplexitie, and in diffidence of reysyng
any army, with such trusty frendes as he had departed into Lyncolnshyre,
consulting what was best to be done, but sodainly or he was
fully determined on any certayn purpose, newes were brought to hym,
that all the Townes and all the countrey adiacent was in a great rore,
and made fiers and sang songes, Cryeng kynge Henry, kyng Henry, a
Warwycke a Warwycke, king Edward was much abashed with these
new tidynges, and more and more his especials and explorators declared
and accōpted to hym, that all the Realme was vp, and by open Proclamacion
cōmaunded to make warre agaynst hym, as enemy to kynge
Henry and the Realme, wherfore hys nere frendes aduised and admonished
hym to flye ouer the sea to the duke of Burgoyne, hys brother
in lawe, there to tary tyll God and fortune should sende him better luck
and chaunce, he beyng somwhat ruled by this consayll, but much more
quickened by hauyng knowlege, that some of the erles of Warwyckes
power was within a halfe dayes iorney, and lesse of hys tayle, with all
hast possible passed the wasshes (in greater ieopardye then it besemed a
Prince to be in) &amp; came to the towne of Lynne, where he founde an English
shyp &amp; .ij. Hulkes of Hollād redy (as fortune wolde) to make sayle
and take their iorney, wherupon he beyng in a maruelous agonye and
doughtyng the mutabilite of the Townes men, takyng no farther leysure
for his sure succor &amp; sauegard, with his brother the duke of Glocester,
the lord Scales, &amp; diuers other his trusty frendes entered into the
shyp, without bagge or bagage, without clothe sacke, or male, and perchaunce
with a great purse, &amp; littel treasure, for he nor his had no leyser
to prouyde, according to their degrees &amp; estates. The lord Chamberlayne
taryed a whyle after exhortyng all hys acquayntance, that of necessitie
should tarye behynde, to shew them self openly as frēdes, to the
parte aduerse for their awne sauegard, but hartely requiryng them priuelie
to cōtinew in their hartes trew to kyng Edward, &amp; frendly to him
&amp; his: this persuasion declared he entered, the ship with the other, which
were redy to depart. This was in the yere of our lordes blessed incarnacion

.M.v.C.lxx. &amp; in the .ix. yere of kynge Edward: When he with one
smal shyp of hys awn, &amp; .ii. Hulkes, &amp; .vij. or .viij.C. persones, with him
hauyng no rayment, but apparel for warre, &amp; smal store of money, sayled
toward Holland. At which tyme the Easterlynges were mortal enemyes,
aswell to the Englishmen as to the Frenche nacion, &amp; had done ye
last yeres past much preiudice &amp; domage to the Englishe marchantes,
bothe in takyng and spoylyng of shyppes.
               And as the kyng with sayle and ower was makynge his course as
fast as coulde be possible the Easterlyuges, whiche had many shippes
of warre on the sea, hym espied (accordyng to the olde prouerbe) one yll
commeth neuer alone, and with .vii. or .viii. gallant shyppes, began to
chace the kyng &amp; his cōpany. The kynges shyp was good with sayle, &amp;
so much gat of the Easterlinges, that she came on the coast of Holland,
and so discended lower, before a towne in Holland, called Alquemare,
and there cast Ancker as nere the towne as was possible, because
they coulde not enter the Hauen at an ebbyng water. The Easterlynges
also approched the Englishe shippe as nere as their great shyppes
coulde come at the lowe water, entendynge at the fludde to haue obteyned
their pray, and so they were likely to do, if Monsieur de Gronture,
gouernour for duke Charles in Holland had not at that season bene
personally present in those parties.
               O what a miserable chaunce &amp; straūge lucke was this to happen so
sodaynly to a kyng, and in especiall to such a kyng, as by his owne valyantnesse
&amp; prowes had ouercome his foes, &amp; destroyed his enemyes in
more then .v. or .vi. great &amp; mortal battayles. Fyrst to be persecuted, exiled,
&amp; expulsed hys awne Realme &amp; kyngdom, by hys awne seruantes,
subiectes and kynsmen. Secondarely, beyng destitute of all helpe and
consolacion, flyeng to his onely frende &amp; brother in law duke Charles,
for refuge and comfort, to be chased on the sea by hys mortall enemyes
and deadly foes, &amp; lyke to be taken prisoner, and brought into captiuitie,
which thyng, if it had happened (as God woulde that it should not)
he had lyen long vnraunsoned (kyng Henry beyng restored to hys pristinate
estate and dignitie royall) or els he had dyed prisoner in greate
wretchednes &amp; misery. These soure sauces he tasted as a penaunce for
hys wanton liuyng, &amp; negligent ouersey
                     •
                  g of thinges that he mighte
well haue forsene &amp; preuented, but his mynd was so geuen to pastyme,
dalyaunce, &amp; sensuall pleasure, that he forgat the olde adage, saynge, in
tyme of peace prouyde for warre, &amp; in y• time of warre prouide for peace
which thyng if he either had wel remēbred, or politiquely prouided for
he had not bene chaced &amp; expulsed his Realme within .xi. dayes as he
was in dede. The onely excuse of his foly is to say, that he so much trusted
fortunes flatteryng, that he thought neuer to see her chaunge, nor
yet to haue at dyce any yll chaunce, or at chestes any checke mate.
               Kyng Edward thus lyeng at Ancker in great feare of the Easterlinges,
was by good chaunce cōforted, &amp; of his great perplexite releued, or

he wist how, for thesame tyme laye in the towne of Alquemare the lord
Gronture, chief gouernour of Hollande, for duke Charles of Borgoyne,
which beyng incontinent aduertised of the kynges arryuall, &amp; also
of the great ieopardy that he was in, prohibited firste the Easterlinges
in no wyse on payne of death, to intermit or medle with any Englishmē
which were both the dukes frendes &amp; alies: which commaundement so
vexed and troubled the Easterlinges, makyng sure reconynge to haue
had for their pray &amp; pryse, a Kyng, a Duke, diuers Barons &amp; ryche gē
                  telmen,
that they cryed out of God, rayled &amp; cursed the duke &amp; hys officer,
and in a rage halsed vp theyr sailes, &amp; without any more expectatiō
of good lucke, departed home to their countray. The lorde Gronture
came a borde y• shyppe, where kyng Edward was, &amp; hym honorably saluted
&amp; requyred him to come to lād, offering hī his seruice with al pleasures
that he coulde do or imagine to be done. The kynge hym hartely
thanked, &amp; was wel reuiued &amp; cōforted with his wordes, &amp; so he with al
hys company were set on lande, &amp; wel refreshed. The lord Gront
                     •
                  re,
lyke a noble man, cōsideryng in what poore, estate &amp; necessitie the kyng
&amp; his people were in, ministred to them habundantly all thinges conuenient
&amp; necessary, accordyng to euery mans estate and degree, at the dukes
charge &amp; cost. And after they had bene well refreshed &amp; newly apparreyled,
he conduyted them to the Hage, a ryche towne in Holland,
where they arryued on the churche holy daye, not longe after Mychelmas.
The lord Gronture, of all this aduenture wrote to the duke hys
master, which there at, was at the fyrst so abasshed &amp; amased to se y• erle
of Warwyke, whome he hated more then a Cocodrylle, to haue the vpperhande
of hys brother, that he had rather haue harde of kynge Edwardes
death, then of hys discomfiture, &amp; especially by the erle of Warwycke,
whome he more feared &amp; disdayned, then any one man liuynge,
yet he willed the lord Gronture to se hym &amp; hys company, wel enterteyned
at the Hage, tyll he sent for them.
               Now let all Englishmen consider (as before is rehersed) what profyt,
what commoditie, &amp; what helpe in distresse, the mariage of the lady
Margarete, kyng Edwardes syster to the duke Charles, dyd to hym in
hys extreme necessitie: &amp; but by that meane vncurable extremitie, for his
alyes &amp; cōferates in Castell &amp; Arragon, were to farre from hym, either
spedely to flye to, or shortely to come fro with any ayde or armye. The
French kyng was hys extreme enemye, and frende to kynge Henry, for
whose cause in the kyng of Scottes (for all the leage betwene them) he
did put littell confidence &amp; lesse truste. The stedes &amp; all Eastland were
with hym at open warre, &amp; yet by thys mariage, God prouided hym a
place to flye to, bothe for refuge &amp; for releue.
               When the fame was spred of kynge Edwardes flyenge, innumerable
people resorted to the erle of Warwycke to take his parte, but all
kyng Edwardes trusty frendes went to diuers sentuaries, dayly lokyng,
&amp; howerly harkening, to heare of his health, &amp; prosperous ret

who afterward serued hym manfully &amp; truly. Emongest other, Quene
Elizabeth hys wyfe, all moste desperate of all comfort, toke sentuarye
at Westmynster, &amp; their in great penurie forsakē of all her frendes,Kynge Edward the .v. borne in sanctuary. was
deliuered of a fayre sonne called Edwarde, which was with small pōpe
lyke a pore mans chyld Christened &amp; Baptised, the Godfathers beyng
the Abbot &amp; Pryor of Westmynster, &amp; the godmother the lady Scrope.
               The Kentyshmen thys season, whose wyttes be euer mouable at the
chaunge of Prynces came to the subberbes of London, &amp; spoyled houses,
robbed berehouses, &amp; by the counsayll of syr Geffray Gates, &amp; other
sentuary men, they brake vp the kynges Benche, &amp; deliuered prisoners,
which fell at Radclefe, Lymehouse, &amp; sainct Katherynes to burnynge of
houses, flaughter of people, &amp; rauishyng of women: which small sparcle
had growen to a greater flame, if the erle of Warwycke with a greate
power had not sodaynly quenched it, &amp; punyshed the offendors: whiche
benefite by hym done, caused hym much more to be praysed &amp; accepted
emonges the commons then he was before. When he had setteled &amp; put
an order in all thinges, according as he thought most conuenient, Upō
the .xij. daye of October he rode to the towre of London, whiche was to
him without resistence deliuered, &amp; there toke kyng Henry the vi. out of
the warde, where he before was kept, &amp; was brought to the kynges lodgyng
&amp; there serued, accordyng to his degre. And the .xxv. daye of the
sayd moneth, the duke of Clarence accompanied with the erles of Warwycke,
Shrewsbury, &amp; the lord Stanley, &amp; other lordes &amp; Gentelmen,
some for feare, &amp; some for loue, and some onely to gase at the waueryng
world, resorted with a greate company to the towre of London, &amp; from
thence with great pompe broughte kynge Henry the .vi. appareled in a
longe gowne of blew veluet, through the hygh streates of London, too
the cathedrall church of sainct Paule, the people on the right hand and
on the left hand, reioysing &amp; cryeng God saue the Kynge, as though all
thyng had succeded as they would haue it, and when he had offered as

of Warwycke) hys croune &amp; dignitie Royall, in the yere of oure Lorde
1471. newly, after so many ouerthrowes beginnynge to reygne, lykely
within short space to fall agayn, &amp; to taste more of his accustomed captiuitie
&amp; vsuall misery. This yll chaūce &amp; misfortune, by many mēs opiniōs
happened to hym, because he was a man of no great wit, suche as
men comonly call an Innocent man, neither a foole, neither very wyse,
whose study always was more to excell, other in Godly liuynge &amp; vertuous
example, then in worldly regiment, or temporall dominion, in so
much, that in cōparison to the study &amp; delectacion that he had to vertue
and godlines, he littel regarded, but in manner despised al worldly power
&amp; temporal authoritie, which syldome folow or seke after such persons,
as frō them flye or disdayne to take them. But hys enemies ascribed

all this to hys coward stommack, afferming that he was a man apt
to no purpose, nor mete for any enterprise, were it neuer so small: But
who so euer dispiseth or dispraiseth, that which the cōmon people allow
and marueyll at, is often taken of them for a mad &amp; vndiscrete person,
but notwithstandyng the vulgare opiniō, he that foloweth, loueth and
embraseth the contrary, doth proue bothe sad and wyse (verifieng Salomons
prouerbe) the wisedom of this world, is folishenes before God.
Other there be that ascribe his infortunitie, onely to the stroke &amp; punishment
of God, afferming that the kyngdome, whiche Henry the .iiij. hys
grandfather wrongfully gat, and vniustly possessed agaynst kyng Rychard
the .ii. &amp; his heyres could not by very diuyne iustice, longe contynew
in that iniurious stocke: And that therfore God by his diuine prouidence,
punished the offence of the grandfather, in the sonnes sonne.
               When kyng Henry had thus obteined agayn, the possession &amp; dominion
of the Realme, he called his hygh court of Parliament to begyn y•
xxvi. day of Nouember at Westmynster, in the whiche kyng Edwarde
was declared a traytor to hys coūtrey, &amp; vsurpor of y• Realme, because
he had vniustly taken on hym, the Croune &amp; Scepter, &amp; all hys gooddes
were cōfiscate &amp; adiudged, forfayted: &amp; lyke sentence was geuen agaynst
all hys partakers &amp; frēdes. And beside this, it was there enacted
that extreme punishment should be done without delay ouer suche persons,
as for his cause were taken or apprehended, &amp; were either in captiuitie,
or went at large vpon trust of their suerties, emongest whom lord
Ihon Typtoft, erle of Worcester lieuetenant, for king Edward in Ireland
excercisinge there more extreme crueltie (as the fame wēt) then princely
pitie, or charitable cōpassion &amp; in especial on .ii. enfantes, being sonnes
to the erle of Desmōd, was either for treason to him layed or malice
agaynst hym conceyued, atteynted &amp; behedded. Besyde this, all estatutes
made by kyng Edward, were clerely reuoked, abrogated, and made
frustrate. The Crounes of the realmes of England &amp; Fraūce, was by y•
authoritie of thesame Parliament entayled to kyng Henry the .vi. and
the heyres males of hys body lawfully begotten, &amp; for default of suche
heyre male of his body begotten, then y• sayd Crounes &amp; dignities were
entayled to George duke of Clarence, &amp; to theyres males of hys bodye
lawfully engendred, and farther the sayd Duke was by authoritie aforesayd
enabled to be next heyre to hys father, Richard duke of Yorke, &amp;
to take by discent from hym all hys landes, dignities &amp; preheminences
as though he had ben hys eldest sonne &amp; heyre, at the tyme of his death.
Iasper erle of Penbroke, and Ihon erle of Oxenford, and diuers other
by kyng Edward attaynted, were restored to theyr olde names, possessions,
and auncient dignities (kepe them euen as longe as they myght)
Beside this, the erle of Warwycke as one to whome the commō welthe
was much beholden, was made Ruler, Gouernor of the Realme, with
whom as felow and compaignion was associated, George duke of Clarence
his sonne in law. So that by these meanes the whole estate, both

of the realme, and the publique wealth of thesame, wer newly altred and
chaunged, yea, and in maner clerely trans
                     •
                  igured and transmuted. To
this Parliament came the lorde Marques Montacute, excusyng hymself
that onely for feare of death, he declined to kyng Edwardes patte,
whiche excuse was so accepted, that he obteined his pardon, whiche, after
was the destruccion, of hym and his brother: For if he had manfully
and appartly taken kyng Edwardes parte, surely he beyng an open enemie,
had muche lesse hurted, then beyng a fained, false and a coloured
frende: for suche thynges as wee se before our iyes, we bee well ware of,
and seldome thynges before knowen, do vs any hurt or preiudice.
               Quene Margaret, after that the erle of Warwicke was sailed into
Englande, euer forcastyng and doubtyng, the chaunce that might happen,
did neuer cease to praie to God, to sende victory to her frendes and
confederates: whiche, when she knewe by her husbandes letters to bee
obteigned, she with Prince Edwarde her sonne, and her trayne, entered
their shippes, to take their voyage into Englande: but the Wynter was
so sore, the wether so stormie, and the wynde so contrariant, that she was
fain to take lande again, and defer her iorney till another season. Her enemies
saied, that it was Goddes iuste prouision, that she whiche had
been the occasion of so many battailes, and of so muche manslaughter
in Englande, should neuer returne thether again, to doo more mischief.
Her frendes on the otherside, said, that she was kept awaie, and her iorney
empeched by Sorcerers and Necromanciers: thus as mennes immaginacions
ranne, their toungues clacked.
               In this season Iasper erle of Penbroke, went into Wales, to visite
his Countie of Penbroke, where he found lorde Henry, sonne to his brother
Edmond Erle of Richmond, hauyng not fully ten yeres of his age
complete, whiche was kept in maner like a captiue: but well and honorably
educated, and in all kynde of Ciuilitie brought vp, by the Lady
Harbert, late wife to Willyam Erle of Penbroke, beheded at Banbery,
as you before haue hard. This lorde Henry was he, that after kyng Richarde,
brother to kyng Edwarde, was vanquished and ouerthrowen,
obteined the Croune and regalitie of this Realme, whom wee ought to
beleue, to bee sent from God, and of hym onely to bee prouided a kyng,
for to extinguishe bothe the faccions and partes, of kyng Henry the .vi.
and of kyng Edwarde the .iiii. (whiche had almoste brought the nobilitie
of this realme, to a finall destruccion and an vtter decaye) consideryng,
that he once exalted to that dignitie, nothyng more mynded, nor to
any one thyng more his studie applied: This Henry was borne of Margaret,
the onely doughter and heire, to Ihon the first Duke of Somerset,
then not beyng fully of .xiiii. yeres of age. The whiche Lady Margaret,
although she were after conioyned in mariage, with Lorde Henry
sonne to Humfrey Duke of Buckyngham, and after to Thomas Stā
                  ley
erle of Darby, bothe beyng lustie, and of age mete for generaciō: yet
afterward she brought furthe no more fruite, as though she had dooen

her part sufficiently, for to haue borne one man child, and thesame to be
a kyng. Iasper erle of Penbroke toke this child beyng his nephew, out
of the custodie of the Lady Harbert, and at his returne, he brought the
childe to London, to kyng Henry the sixte, whom, when the kyng had a
good space by hymself, secretly beholden and marked, bothe his wit and
his likely towardnes, he saied to suche princes, as were then with hym:
Lo,This was Kyng Henry the seuent
                        •
                     . surely this is he, to whom bothe wee and our aduersaris leuyng the
possession of all thynges, shall hereafter geue rome and place. So this
holy man shewed before, the chaunce that should happen, that this erle
Henry so ordeined by God, should in tyme to come (as he did in deede)
haue and enioye the kyngdome and the whole rule of the realme.
               As I haue shewed to you before, what thynges wer doen in Englāde
after that kyng Henry had obteined the newe possession, of his old kyngdome,
thynkyng surely to haue possessed, and enioyed thesame lenger
season then either he did, or could by his aduersaries, bee permitted or
suffered to do: so must I of congruent necessitie declare vnto you, what
greate perplexitie, what sodain trouble, what multiplicitie of immaginacions,
the landyng of kyng Edward in Friseland, brought to and encombered
with all, Charles Duke of Burgoyn: and how fraudulently
for his awne auauntage he dissimuled, first with kyng Edward, and after
with his partie aduerse, and how that he openly denied aide to kyng
Edwarde, when he priuily ministered, ample and large succors to hym
and his. I thynke you would not, that these thynges should be forgotten:
wherfore you must call to remembraunce, how that Duke Charles
had before this (as you haue hard) greate intelligence with Monsire de
Uawclere, as he list hymself to be called, either chief Capitain of Caleis
or els deputie Capitain, to the erle of Warwicke, whiche had promised
to hym by the Duke, a pencion yerely of a thousande Crounes, to the intent
to stande still true to kyng Edward, and to relinquishe kyng Henry,
but in especial to abandon therle of Warwicke. The duke although
that he had smal confidence, but rather greate diffidence in the othe and
promise of Mōsire de Uawclere: thought it necessary to knowe, in what
case Caleis stode, and what mutaciōs wer there, because it was his next
neighbor, (for that tyme Bulleyn, and Bullenoys, and all Artoys, were
in the handes of Duke Charles) as a pledge deliuered to his father, as
is before rehersed. Wherfore in al hast (before he sent for kyng Edward
or spake with hym) he sent his trustie counsailer Phillip de Commines,
accompaignied with twoo gentle men to Caleis, whiche twoo gentlemē
fauoredmore the partie of Lancastre then of Yorke. The lorde of Argē
                  ton
met with the people of the countrey of Bullenois, fliyng from euery
parte like wylde dere. For the erle of Warwicke, had now lately sent to
Caleis, foure hūdred archers on horsebacke, whiche forraied and spoyled
all the countrey of Bullenoys. The Dukes messengers, whiche had
not sene so soda
                     ••
                   mutacion of worldly thynges, durst not kepe on their
iorney, but thesame night taried at Turnoham, and sent to Monsire de

Uawclere for a saueconduite, and also wrote to the Duke, of the feare
that thei were in. The Duke sent woorde to Phillip de Commes, that
he and his with all spede, should passe toward Caleis, and if thei there
wer taken, he would shortly for a raunsom, bye or redeme theim again.
For he passed litle, either of the pein of his seruaūt, or of his charge and
expence, so that his purpose might bee serued. When this woorde was
brought to the messengers at Turnehan, at thesame tyme thei receiued
a letter, from Monsire de Uawclere, with louyng wordes and gracious
termes, declaryng that thei might safely come, and frely departe, as before
thei wer liberally accustomed: so that sir Phillip and his compaignions
came to Caleis, without any meting or solempne entertainment
contrary to tholde fashion that he had sene. Whē thei entered the toune
thei might perceiue euery man, did were therle of Warwickes badge, &amp;
on euery dore wer set white Crosses, and ragged staues, with times and
poyses, whiche purported the Frenche kyng, and the erle of Warwicke
wer al one. These thynges semed very straunge, and nothyng pleasaunt
to the Burgonions. The lorde Uawclere sent for them to diner the next
day, beyng wel accompaignied, &amp; did were on his cappe, a white ragged
staffe of gold enameled, and so did many other, and he that could haue it
neither of gold nor of siluer, had it of silke or cloth. This badge was taken
vp within one quarter of an houre, after the newes came out of England:
suche is the mutacion of the cōmon people, like a rede with euery
wind is agitable &amp; flexible. While these Burgoniōs laie thus in Caleis
thei had knowlege that therle of Warwicke had prepared .iiii.M. valiaunt
men to make frontier warre on the Dukes countreis, whereof by
poste thei certified the Duke, whiche so fumed, and smoked at the matter,
that he wist neither well what to do, nor of whom to aske confortable
or wholesome counsaill. For warre he was compelled to haue with the
Frenche kyng, whiche had taken from him certain tounes: and if he succoured
kyng Edward, he was sure that with the Erle of Warwicke, he
should haue no p

                  r, all the worlde of hym might speake shame, vnfaithfulnesse and

messengers, that thei should require to haue the league made, betwene
the twoo realmes, kept and obserued, with diuerse other priuie instruccions
Phillip de Comines, beyng wise and well learned, declared to
the counsaill of Cal
                     ••
                  s, that the Duke his Master not alitle marueiled
why the Englishemen should ouer runne, and destroye his Countreis,
hauyng aleague in sure, so strong, and with so many wordes of efficacie
enfor
                     •
                  ed, lately made betwene the twoo countreis, their territories and
dominions, affermyng that the mutacion of the Prince, is no dissoluciō
of the league: For although the Princes be named, as chief contractors
in euery treatie and amitie concluded, yet the Countreis are bounden,
and the subiectes shall make recompence, if any thynge bee altered

wrongfully out of his course. And the rather to obtein their desire, thei
caused all the merchauntes gooddes of Englande, beyng in the Dukes
Countreis, to be attached for the redresse of the spoyle, that the English
men had dooen in the Dukes Countrey. Whiche sore greued the Merchauntes,
and muche hindered their voyages: beside this, the Merchā
                  tes
of the Staple of Caleis, wrote to the kyng, and to the erle of Warwicke:
how, if their Wolle and fell at Caleis, were not sold and vttered,
as it was wont to be (the greatest part wherof, was bought by the Dukes
subiectes and vassals for redy money) the souldiers of the garrison,
should lacke their wages, the king should not be paied his custome, and
the Merchaunt in conclusion should stande in aduenture, bothe of losse
of stocke and credence. These perswasions mollified therle of Warwickes
mynde, and especially, because the kyng had no greate store of money▪
to furnishe Caleis with al, which store if he had had, surely the duke
of Burgoyne for all the league, had been a litle disturbed, and geuously
molested. But consideryng that all thynges were not, correspondent at
this tyme to therles appetite: he was content that it should be thus condescended
and agreed, that the alyaunce made betwene the Realme of
Englande and the Dukes dominions, should still remain muiolated,
sauyng in the stede of Edwarde, should bee put for the kyng, this name
Henry. This conclusion thus brought to an ende, came (euen as a man
would wishe) to passe, for the Duke of Burgoyns purpose, for at this
same tyme, the Frenche kyng had wonne from hym, the faire toune of
Amias, and sainct Quintines, so that if the Duke should haue had war
bothe with Fraūce and England, he had been likely to haue been shortely
a poore Duke, and els vtterly vndoen and brought to destruccion.
And to pacifie and please the Erle of Warwicke, whom he neuer loued
and lesse fauored: he wrote louyngly to hym, declaryng that as he was
lineally descended, and naturally procreated, of the noble stocke and familie
of Lancaster, by his graund mother, beyng daughter to the high
and mightie Prince Ihon of Gaunt, Duke of Lancastre: so was he by
nature obliged, and by aliance enforsed to support, honor, maintein, and
defend, thesaid noble house and lignage, duryng his life, as euer he hath
doen, bothe in worde and deede, against all maner of persones and estates:
further more, promisyng to beare his good harte, louyng mind, and
frendly fauor, to kyng Henry the sixte and his sequele, before all other
Princes and Potentates, with many other flatteryng termes, and glosyng
wordes: which faire promises, I thynke neither the Duke hymself
inwardly mynded, nor yet the erle outwardly beleued.
               Now to returne to kyng Edward, beyng in the Duke of Burgoyns
lande, whiche, although he wer out of his countrey, yet did he neuer dispaire,
but had a ferme hope, to haue a mature and ready occasion to him
geuen, how to obtein his kyngdome and dominion, and that in shorte
space. For partly, he hoped of a greate helpe, of his brother in lawe the
Duke of Burgoyn, and partly, he was daily solicited by the letters and

messages of men of his faccion in Englande, to returne with all spede,
promisyng hym compaignie and comforte. Many other there wer, whiche
either for feare of the rigor of the lawe, whiche thei had offended, or
els disdainyng that the worlde was so altered: or els beyng brought in
to kyng Edwardes fauor, had hope to excercise their pollyng romes, as
thei did before his fliyng out of Englande, daily came to him from Englande,
and prouoked hym more and more, to take his iorney homward
Kyng Edward in maner rauished with their golden promises, came to
the Duke of Burgoyn, to the toune of Sent Poll, and there declared to
hym what greate intelligence he had in the realme of Englad, and what
assured frēdes he had in thesame, requiryng hym to aide hym with spede
as his onely truste, and sole hope of relife was in hym, beyng not onely
his brother in law, but eche beyng compaignion of others order: for the
kyng ware the golden Flees, and the duke ware the Gartier. The duke
of Somerset, whiche was cosin germain, remoued to the Duke of Burgoyn,
and brought vp and had a pencion in the Dukes house. (For surely
the Duke of Burgoin loued better the house of Lancastre, then the
house of Yorke) sore labored to the contrary, affirmyng that it was both
vngodly, vnprincely, and vnnaturall, to exalte and set vp a straunger,
hauyng no right, and to depose and depriue his naturall kynsman, hauyng
a iuste title discended to hym, from the kyng his father, &amp; the kyng
his grandfather, from his scepter and regalitie. Duke Charles was in
a greate perplexitie, not knowyng well what to say, whether consanguinitie
should preuaile more, or affinitie, or nature before fauor, not willyng
if he might, to displease any of bothe the parties. But because the
warre was ouert at his very nose, with the Frenche kyng: he concluded
openly (but intendyng another thyng secretly) to aide the Duke of Somerset,
and other that were with hym, takyng of them certain promises,
for thynges to be doen against the erle of Warwicke: when thei should
espie their time, moste propice and conuenient: The Duke of Somerset
ioyous of these newes, sailed into Englande, and made report to Kyng
Henry. Kyng Edward was presente, and heard all this determinacion,
whiche brought hym into a great heauines, and a depe perplexitie: how
beit, he was priuely aduertised by a frende, that these cloked dissimulacions,
were onely for this cause, that Duke Charles would in nowise,
haue warre with bothe the realmes at once, and further, if thesaid duke
were put to the worse, or vanquished by the Frenche kyng, then he were
not able, neither to aide, nor to succor king Edward. Wherfore to blind
with al the Frenche kyng, whiche sore desired, that the duke might haue
warre with Englande: for then he knewe that his enterprise, were more
then halfe gotten. The Duke declared openly, that he would in nowyse
minister any succors to kyng Edward, streightly chargyng &amp; commaū
                  dyng,
vpon pein of the harte, that no man should once passe the sea with
hym, or in his armie. But al this proclamacion notwithstandyng when
the duke saw that kyng Edward, vpō hope of his frendes, would nedes

repaire into Englande again (he hauyng cōpassion of his vnfortunate
chaunce, caused priuily to be deliuered to hym fiftie M. Florence, of the
crosse of sainct Andrewe, and further caused foure greate shippes to bee
appoynted for hym, in the hauen of Uere in Zelande, whiche is fre for al
men to come to, and the Duke hired farther for hym .xiiii. shippes of the
Esterlynges, well appoynted, and for the more suretie, toke bonde of thē
to serue them truly, till he wer landed in Englande, and .xv. daies after.
Of whiche returnyng, the Esterlynges were glad▪ trustyng that by that

                  cion of their liberties
and franchises, whiche thei claimed to haue within Englande. The

                     •
                  t of his money. For he would oft saie, that
he was frend to bothe partes, and eche parte was trendly to hym.
            
            
               The .x. yere.The .x. yere.
               
               
                  KYng Edwarde beeyng thus furnished, thought nothyng
more peinfull &amp; wretched, then the tariyng of one daie lenger,
nor nothyng more to bee desired, then with all celerite
to saile toward his countrey: whervpon hauyng with hym
onely .ii.M. men of warre, beside mariners, in the spryng
of the yere. In the yere of our Lorde .1461. at thesame very season, that
the Duke of Burgoyn, went to fight with the Frenche kyng at Amias.
He sailed into Englande,Kyng Edwardes landyng. and came on the cost of Yorke shire, to a place
called Rauenspurt, and there settyng all his men on lande, he consulted
with his Capitaines, to knowe to what place, thei should first for succor
resort vnto: for he imagined that no waie could be for hym sure, hauyng
so small a compaignie of souldiours.
               After long debatyng, it was concluded, that diuerse persones hauyng
light horses, should skoure the countrey on euery side, to se if by any perswasions,
thei might allure the hartes of the rusticall and vplandishe
people to take kyng Edwardes part, aud to were harnes in his querel:
whiche, with all diligence, folowed their cōmission. It semeth somewhat
to leane to the truthe, that kyng Edward beyng a wise and a circūspecte
Prince▪ would not haue been so foolishe hardy, as to enter Englande
with halfe a handfull of men of warre, excepte he had been sure of spedy
succor, and faithfull frendship: In whiche argument is no doubte, but
that the Duke of Clarence and he, were secretly agreed before, and that
the Marques Montacute, had secretly procured his fauor, of whiche
priuie signes and cloked workynges, open tokens, &amp; manifest doynges,
afterward appered. The light horsemen whiche were sent aboute, after
thei had felte the myndes and ententes, of the rude people (as muche as
thei might) thei returned to kyng Edward the nexte daie, makyng relacion
that all the tounes rounde aboute, wer permanent and stiffe on the
parte of kyng Henry, and could not bee remoued: and that it was but a

folye farther to solicite or attempt them, considerynge that when they
were moued and exhorted too bee trew too kynge Edwarde, not one
man durste speke for feare of the Erle of Warwycke.
               Which aunswere, when kynge Edwarde had perfitly digested, of very
necessitie he chaunged hys purpose: for where before his clayme was to
be restored to the croune and kyngdome of England, nowe he caused it
to be published that he onely claymed the Duchie of Yorke, to ye entent
that in requyryng nothyng, but that which was bothe trew and honest,
he might obtayne the more fauor of the common people. It was almost
incredible to se what effect this new imaginacion (all thoughe it were
but fayned) sorted and toke immediatly vpon the fyrst opening (Such
a power hath Iustice euer emōgest all men) whē it was blowen abrode
that kyng Edwardes desyre was farther from nothyng, then from the
couetyng or desyre of the kyngdome and royall dominion, and that he
no erthelye promocion desyred before hys iust patrimony, and lyn

                  all
enheritance: All men moued with mercye and compassion, began out of
hande either to fauor hym or els not to resist him, so that he mighte obteyne
hys duchye of Yorke, when he had founde these meanes to pacifie
mens myndes, and to reconcile their hartes, he determined to take hys
iorney toward Yorke, and so went to Beuerley. The erle of Warwycke
which then lay in Warwykeshyre, beyng enformed that king Edward
was landed, and goyng toward Yorke, with all hast wrote to the Marques
Montacute hys brother, whiche had lyen at the Castell of Pomfret
all the laste wynter, with a great company of Souldears, geuynge
hym warnyng, and aduertesyng him in what perill their whole affayres
flode in, if their enemy should obtayne the possessiō, or entre into the
citie of Yorke, willyng and commaunding him to set on kyng Edward
with all expedicion, &amp; byd him battayle, or els to kepe the passage, that
he should passe no farther, tyll he hym self had gathered a greater host,
which with all diligence, he was assemblynge to come and ioyne with
hys brother the Marques. And because that the erle knew not by what
way hys enemies wolde take their iorney, he wrote to all the townes of
Yorkeshyre, and to the citie also, commaundyng all men on the kynges
behalfe, to be redy in harnes, and to shutte their gates against the kynges
enemyes. Kyng Edward without any wordes spoken to him, came
peaceably nere to Yorke, of whose commynge, when the citiezens were
certefied, without delay they armed them selfe, and came to defende the
gates, sendyng to hym two of the chiefest Aldermen of the citie, whiche
ernestly admonished hym on their behalfe to come not one foote nerar,
nor temerariouslye to enter in to so great a 
                     •
                  eopardy, considering that
they were fully determined, and bent to cōpell hym to retract with dēt
of swourd, kyng Edward markyng well their message, was not a littell
trobled and vnquieted in hys mynde, and driuen to seke the furthest
poynt of hys wit, for he had both two mischeuous and perilous chaunces,
euen before hys eyes, which were hard to be euaded or refelled, one

was if he should go backe agayn, he feared lest the rurall and commen
people for coueteousnes of pray, and spoyle, would fall on hym, as one
that fled away for feare &amp; 
                     •
                  reade. The other was, if he shoulde procede
any farther in hys iorney, then myght the citiezens of 
                     •
                  orke issue out
with all their power, and sodaynly circūuent hym and take hym, wherfore
he determined to set forward, neither with army nor with weapon:
but with lowly wordes, and gentel entreatynges, requyryng most hartely
the messengers that were sent, to declare to y• citiezens, that he came
neither to demaunde the realme of Englande, nor the superioritie of the
same, but onely the duchie of Yorke his olde enheritance, the which duchie,
if he might by their meanes readept and recouer, he woulde neuer
let passe out of hys memorie so great a benifite, and so frendly a gratuitie
to hym exhibited. And so with fayre wordes and flatterynge speche
he dismissed the messengers, and with good spede he and hys folowed so
quickly after, that they were almost at ye gates as sone as the Ambassadors.
The citiezens heryng hys good answere, that he ment, nor entendyng
nothynge preiudiciall to kynge Henry, nor his royall authoritie,
were much mitigated &amp; cooled, &amp; began to commen with hym from their
walles, willyng him to conuey hym selfe in to some other place without
delay, which if he did they assured hym, y• he should haue neither hurte
nor damage, but he gently speakyng to all men, and especialy to suche
as were Aldermen, whome he called worshipfull, and by their proper
names them saluted, after many fayre promises to them made, exhorted
and desyred them that by their fauorable frendshyp, &amp; frendly permissiō
he might enter in to his awne towne, of the which he had both his name
and title. Al the whole daye was consumed in doutfull communicacion
and erne
                     •
                  t interlocution. The citiezens partely wōne by hys fayre wordes,
and partly by hope of hys large promises, fell to this pact &amp; conuē
                  cion,
that if kyng Edward woulde swere to entertayne hys citiezens of
Yorke after a gentell sorte &amp; fa

                  , yon, and here after to be obedient, and
faythfull to all kyng Henryes commaundementes and preceptes, that
then they woulde receyue hym in to their citie, &amp; ayde and cōfort hym
with money. Kyng Edward (whome the citiezens called onely duke of
Yorke) beyng glad of this fortunate chaunce,Kyng Edwardes othe of obedience to kyng Henry 
                        〈◊〉
                      .vi. in the next mornyng, at y•
gate where he should enter, a Priest beyng redy to say masse, in y• masse
tyme receyuyng the body of our blessed Sauior, solemply swearyng to
kepe and obserue the two Articles aboue mencioned, and agreed vpon,
when it was far vnlike, that he either entended or purposed to obserue
any of them, which plainly afterward was to all men manifest, euidētly
perceyuyng, that he toke nomore studye or diligēce for any one earthly
thyng▪ then he dyd to persecute king Henry, &amp; to spoile him of his kingdome.
So it is dayly sene that aswel princes, as men of lesser reputatiō
led by blynd auarice and deuelish ambicion, forgettynge the scruple of
conscience, &amp; the ende of all honestie, vse, to take an othe by y• immortal
God, which they know perfitly, shalbe brokē &amp; violate hereafter, before

the othe be fyrst made or sworne: yet these persons (as examples thereof
be not very straunge to fynde) at one tyme or other be worthely scorged
for their periurie, in so much often tymes that the blot of suche offence
of the parentes is punished in the sequele &amp; posteritie: of this thynge I
may fortune to speke more in the lyfe of Rycharde the .iij. as the cause
shall arise where it may euidētly appeare, that the progeny of kyng Edward
scaped not vntouched for this open periurie.
               When kyng Edward had appesed the citiezens, and that their fury
was past, he entred in to the citie, &amp; clerely forgettinge his othe, he first
set a garrison of souldiers in the towne, to the entent y• nothyng should
be moued agaynst hym by the citezens, &amp; after he gathered a great host,
by reason of his money. Whē all thing was redy, according as he desyred,
because he was enformed that his enemyes did make no great preparacion
to resist hym, he thought it necessarie therefore with the more
spede and diligence to make hast toward London: and as it were for y•
nones, he left the right way toward Pomfret, where the Marques Mō
                  tagew
with his army lay, and toke the way on the right hand, not fully
iiii. myle from the cāpe of his enemyes. And whē he saw that they made
no stirryng, nor once shewed thē selfe in sight, he returned in to y• cōmen
hygh way agayne, a littel beyonde their campe, and came sauely to the
towne of Notingham, where came to him syr William Parre, syr Thomas
a Borogh, syr Thomas Montgomerie, and diuers other of hys
assured frendes with their aydes, which caused hym at the fyrst cōming
to make Proclamacion in hys owne name, kyng Edward the .iiii. boldely
sayng to hym, that they would serue no man but a kynge. This
Proclamacion cast a great shame and dolor in to the hartes of the citezens
of Yorke, for that they might apparently perceyue, that they were
fraudulently seduced, and for their good wil vnhonestly (if it might be
sayde) deluded and mocked. But when the fame was blowen abrode, y•
kyng Edward, without any detriment, was in sauetyme come to Notyngham,
Princes and noble men on all sydes began to fall to hym, fermely
beleuyng, that either the Marques Montacute, beryng fauor too
kyng Edwarde, woulde not once with hym encounter, or that he was a
frayde to set ouer or to geue battayl, knowynge not to what parte hys
souldiers would enclyne. But what soeuer the occasion was, the moste
parte thought it more for their securitie and auantage of theim selfs, to
take parte and ioyne with kyng Edward, beyng at all poyntes furnisshed
with men of warre, rather then to cleue to kyng Hēry, and to be alwayes
in ieopardy, both of lyfe and lande. Kyng Edward (as you can
not blame hym) beynge with these good fortunes animated, &amp; with his
army furnished at all poyntes, came to his towne of Lecester, &amp; there
heryng that the erle of Warwycke, accompanied with Ihon erle of Oxford
were together at Warwycke with a great power, &amp; were both determined
to set on hym, he politiquely imagening to preuent their inuē
                  cion,
determined in great haste to remoue his whole army, hopyng surely,

either to geue them battayle, either to allure and bryng to his side
hys brother George duke of Clarence, and to comen with him in some
priuie place, before he came to his confederates: lest peraduenture he
should be by them, illaquiated &amp; cōpased, knowinge that the duke was
in nothyng constant, nor in one mynd long permanent.
               In this very season to tell you how the erle of Warwycke was displeased,
and grudged agaynst his brother the Marques, for lettynge
kyng Edward passe, it ware to longe to write: for where he hym self had
viguantlye prouided &amp; politiquely forsene, for all thinges, ye Marques
neuerthelesse where the power of their enemies first began to gather, neuer
moued fote, nor made resistence as he was commaunded, but besydes
thys suffered them with a so small number of souldiers, before hys
eyes &amp; in his open sight, without any battayle to passe by: wherfore the
erle consideryng that kyng Edward did dayly encrease hys power (as
a runnyng ryuer by goyng more &amp; more augmenteth) thought it moste
necessary for hym, to geue him battayle with spede, and therupon accersed
&amp; called together hys army, and in all hast sent for the duke of Clarence,
to ioyne with hym which had conscribed, &amp; assembled together a
great host about London. But when he perceiued that the duke lyngered,
&amp; dyd all thinges negligētly, as though he were in doubt of warre
or peace, he then began somwhat to suspect, that the duke was of hys
bretherne corrupted &amp; lately chaūged, and therfore without delay marched
forward toward Couentry, to thentent to set on hys enemyes. In
the meane season, kyng Edward came to Warwycke, where he founde
all the people departed, and from thence with al diligence auaūced his
power toward Couentre, &amp; in a playne by the citie he pytched his felde.
And the next day after that he cam thither, hys men were set forwarde,
and marshalled in array, &amp; he valiātly bad the erle battayle: which mistrustyng
that he should be deceaued by the duke of Clarēce (as he was
in dede) kept hym selfe close within the Walles. And yet he had perfect
worde y• the duke of Clarence came forward toward hym with a great
army, kyng Edward beynge also therof enformed, raysed hys campe, &amp;
made toward the duke. And lest that there might be thought some fraude
to be cloked betwene them, the kyng set hys battayles in an order as
though he would fight without any lēger delay, the duke did likewise.
Whē eche host was in sight of other, Rychard duke of Glocester, brother
to them both, as though he had bene made arbitrer betwene them,
fyrst rode to the duke, and with hym commoned very secretly: from him
he came to kyng Edward, and with lyke secretnes so vsed hym, that in
conclusion no vnnaturall warre, but a fraternall amitie was concluded
and proclaymed, and then leuyng all armye and weapō a syde, both
the bretherne louyngly embraced, and familierly commoned together.
It was no meruayll that the duke of Clarēce, with so small persuasion
and lesse exhortynge, turned from the erle of Warwyckes parte, for as
you haue hard before, thys marchandyse was labored, conduyted and

concluded by a damsell, when the duke was in the French court, to the
erles vtter confusion.
               After this, kyng Edward caused to be proclaymed, that the duke &amp;
all that came with hym, should be taken as hys trew frendes, without
fraude or yll suspicion. But this not withstandyng, it semeth that God
dyd neither forgeue nor forget to punishe the duke with condigne punishment,
for violatyng and brekyng hys othe solempnely, and aduysedly
taken and made to the erle of Warwycke, for God not many yeres
after, suffered hym lyke a periured person to dye a cruell &amp; a straū
                  ge
death.
               Then was it concluded emongest the .iij. brethern to attempte therle
of Warwycke, if by any fayre meanes he might be recōsiled or any promise
allured to their parte: To whom the duke of Clarence sent diuers
of hys secret frendes, first to excuse hym of the acte that he had done, secondarely
to requyre hym to take some good ende now, whyle he might
with kyng Edward.
               When the erle had hard paciently the dukes message, lord, howe he
detested &amp; accursed him, cryenge out on him, that he cōtrary to his othe
promise &amp; fidelitie, had shamfully turned his face from his confederates
&amp; alies: But to the dukes messengers he gaue none other aunswere
but this, that he had leuer be always lyke hym selfe, then lyke a false &amp;
a periured duk
                     •
                  , and that he was fully determined neuer to leue warre
tyll either he had lost hys awne naturall lyfe, or vtterly extinguished &amp;
put vnder his foes and enemyes.
               From thence kyng Edward thus beyng furnished of a strong host,
went without any maner of diffidēce or mistrust toward Lōdon (where
after that it was knowen that the duke of Clarence was cōme to hys
brethern, &amp; that all they came together in one knot to the citie, suche a
feare rose sodaynly emongest the citiezens, that they were dryuē to their
wittes ende, not knowing either what to do or to say, but at y• last very
feare compelled them to take kyng Edwardes parte. The selfe same
season, the erle of Warwycke sent letters to kyng Henry, to the duke of
Somerset, tharchebishop of Yorke, &amp; other of hys counsayll, that they
should kepe the citie from their enemies handes, by the space of .ii. or .iii
dayes after the comming of their enemies, and that he shortely woulde
be at hande, with a puyssant armye. They as they were cōmaunded defended
the citie strongly, but it was to small purpose, for the citiezens
in thesame tyme began maturely to consult, what parte they should folow
for their most indempnite: and in conclusion when they considered
that kyng Henry was such an innocent person, as of hym self was not
most apte to moderate and gouerne the publique wealth of the realme.
And that on the other syde, kyng Edward by no other mens document,
but onely by hys awne pollicie and wyt was wont to order the Realme
and gouerne the kyngdome. And farther that kyng Edward was such
a person as was able bothe to defende hym selfe and also all hys, from

iniurie and hostilitie, wherupon all men were glad to leane to hym, and
to take hys parte. They concluded to take hys parte &amp; to recryue hym
in to the citie: which determinacion beyng blowē abrode (as the nature
of the people is euer to delyte in nouelties) the communaltie coulde not
be compelled by no commaundement to tarye at home, but ranne in hepes
out of the citie, to mete hym, and saluted hym as their kyng and souereygne
lord. When the duke of Somerset and other of kynge Henryes
frēdes, saw the world thus sodaynly chaunged, euery man fledde,
and in hast shyfted for hym selfe, leuyng kyng Henry alone, as an host
that should be sacrificed, in the Bishops palace of London, adioyning
to Poules churche,Kyng
                        •
                      Henry the .vi. agayne taken and cō
                     mitted to pryson. not knowing of whom, nor what counsayll to aske,
as he which with troble and aduersitie was clerely dulled and appalled,
in which place he was by kynge Edward taken, and agayne committed
to prison and captiuitie.
               Thys was a sodayne chaunge, for thesame day, the Archebishop of
Yorke to the entent that the people myght more fermely stycke on hys
syde, caused hym to ryde about London, appareled in a gowne of blewe
veluet, with a great company cryeng kyng Henry, kyng Henry (whiche
sight asmuch pleased the citiezens as a fier paynted on the wall, warmed
the olde woman) not knowynge that or nyght, hys tryumphynge
shoulde be iorned to trymblynge, and hys solempnitie conuerted in to
mournyng, such chaūce was to hym prouided. Kyng Edward returned
to London agayn the .xi. daye of April, sixe monethes after that he had
sayled in to Flaunders: and fyrste callynge before hym a greate assemble
of people, hyghly commēded the fidelitie of the citiezens, which they
constantly bare unto hym, rendryng to the Aldermen, most harty thankes
for that, that they had kept, and cuased the people to continew, and
be permanent in their good myndes and loyaltie toward hym, blaming
farther and rebukynge as well Marchaunt straungers, as Englishemen,
whome he knew to haue prested, and lente money to kynge Henry
for the arrayenge and settynge forth of a new armye agaynst hym. But
when he had greuously wyth terrible wordes declared to them theyr sedicious
cryme &amp; trayterous offence, he had them be of good comforte, &amp;
to expell all feare, for he released to them bothe the punyshment of theyr
bodyes, and losse of gooddes, and graunted to theim Pardon for theyr
faultes and offences, by whiche gentell meane and easy indulgencie, he
reconciled to hym the hartes of the whole multitude, obteyning that, by
fayre and louynge wordes, whiche he coulde not haue acheued with
sharpe strokes, and blody woundes.
               Therle of Warwicke ponderyng, that the gain of the whole battaill
stode in makyng haste, with all diligence, followed hisenemies, hopyng
(that if thei wer let neuer so litle, with any stop or tariyng by the way) to
fight with thē before thei should come to Lōdon: the which he thought,
should be muche to his auauntage, cōsideryng that he perfightly knew
the citee to bee destitute of men of warre for defence, and to haue no maner

of municions, to set on the walles or towers, so that thei wer no able
to abide a siege, and for that cause, euer thei inclined to the victorious
and stronger parte. But when he followyng his enemies, had passed a
greate part of his iorney, he was enformed that kyng Edward, peaceably
was entered into London, and had taken, and sent kyng Henry to
prison again: Whiche thynges depely considered, he sawe that al cauillacions
of necessitie, wer now brought to this ende, that thei must be cō
                  mitted
to thasard and chaunce of one battaill, wherefore, he rested with
his army, at the toune of sainct Albons, partly, to refreshe his souldiers
and partly, to take counsaill what was best to dooe. In the erles armie
wer Ihon Duke of Excester, Edmond Erle of Somerset, Ihon Erle of
Oxenford, and Ihon Marques Montacute, whom the erle his brother
well knewe, not to bee well mynded (but sore against his stomacke) to
take parte with these Lordes, and therefore stode in a doubt, whether he
at this tyme, might trust hym or no, but the fraternall loue betwene thē,
washed awaie and diminished all suspicion: But what so euer opinion
therle conceiued of hym or any other, the erle as a man past all feare, determined
coragiously to sette on his enemies. And from sainct Albones,
he remoued to a village in the meane waie, betwene London and sainct
Albones called Barnet,Barnet felde beyng tenne mile distaunt from bothe the tounes.
This toune standeth on an hill, on whose toppe is a faire plain, for
twoo armies to ioyne together, on the one part of this plain, the Erle of
Warwicke pitched his feld, tariyng for his enemies. The rumor of the
erles commyng, was spred in an instant ouer all London, whiche quickened
kyng Edward not a litle, wherefore with all spede he adioyned to
that hoste, that he brought with hym firste to London, a compaignie of
elect, picked, and chosen persones, strong, young, and mete for all assaies,
beside other new aides, that were then come to hym: Harnesse, weapons,
horse, and all other engines, instrumentes mete for the warre, he neither
forgatte, nor slackly furnished. What shall I saie more, he determined
clerely to spende all his riches, yea, and all that he could imagyn vpon
the chaunce of this battaill: Firmely beleuyng, that this conflict, should
knit vp the knot of all his labor, and bryng hym to quietnes. So with
a puyssaunt armie, he marched forwarde, and to put his people in vre,
that thei might bee the more ready to fight, when so euer thei should encoūter
with their enemies, he deuided theim in foure partes. He brought
with hym also kyng Henry the sixte, of all likelyhod for this intent, that
either his aduersaries, seyng their kyng stande as a prisoner in captiuitie,
should bee abashed and discomfited by hym, or els if the fortune of
the battaill should turne against hym, that then kyng Henry should be
to hym, bothe a sauegard and a protecciō. On Easter eue at after noone
he came to Barnet, and there not farre from his enemies, he encamped
his army, and least his enemies should compel hym to fight that night,
he enuironed his campe, with newe fortificacions and trenches: For tariyng
that night, was to hym a synguler profite, and to his enemies a

greate detriment: Consideryng the lenger he taried, the more people
came to his aide, the more stronger was his power, and the stronger that
his power was, so muche weaker was the part of the aduersaries, whiche
was farre from all succor, and hoped of no newe relief nor comforte.
Thus bothe the armies lodged that night on the plain, but not out of
their harnesse, for their tentes were so nere together, in the whiche, what
for neighyng of horsses, and talkyng of menne, none of bothe the hostes
could that night, take any rest or quietnes. At the breakyng of the daie,
the erle of Warwicke sette his men in a raie, in this maner: In the right
wyng, he set the Marques Montacute, and the Erle of Oxenford, with
certain horsemen, and he with the Duke of Exceter, toke the left wyng,
and in the middes betwene bothe, he set archers, and to them he appointed
the duke of Somerset to bee capitain. And when he had set his men
in an order, he encoraged his men to fight, with many comfortable wordes,
willyng theim to strike with a good and a fierce corage, and to remembre
that thei fight, not onely for the libertie of the countrey, against
a tiraunte, whiche wrongfully and against all right, had inuaded and
subdued this realme, but thei fight in the querell of a true, and vndubitate
kyng, against a cruell man, and a torcious vsurper, in the cause of
a Godly, and a pitifull Prince, against an abhominable māqueller, and
blou
                     •
                  y butcher: In the title of a gentle, liberall, and bountifull kyng, against
an extreme nigard, and a coueteous extorcioner. In whiche cause
being so good, so godly &amp; so iust, God of very iustice must bedes be their
shelde and defence. Kyng Edward likewise ordred his battailes. In the
forward he set the duke of Gloucester, the middle ward, he hymself with
the Duke of Clarence▪ hauyng with them kyng Henry, did rule and gouerne,
the lorde Hastynges led the rereward, and besides these three battales,
he kept a compaignie of freshe men in store, whiche did hym great
pleasure, and this dooen, he encoraged his men, saiyng: that their aduersaries
wer onely traitors to the realme, spoylers of the pore commonaltie,
and people destitute of al grace, good fortune, &amp; good liuyng. Whiche
mischeuous persones, if thei should preuaile through the faintnesse
of your hartes, all you gentlemen and richmen, wer in ieoperdy of your
lifes, all meane men in dounbt of robbyng and spoylyng: and all inferior
persones, in hasard of perpetuall bondage andseruitude.
               When the daie began to spryng, the trompettes blewe vp coragiously,
and the battaill fiersly began, Archers firste shot, and bill men theim
folowed▪ Kyng Edward hauyng the greater nomber of men, valiauntly
set on his enemies. The erle on the otherside, remembryng his auncient
fame and renoume, manfully withstode hym. This battaill on bothe sides
was sore fought &amp; many slain, in whose romes succeded euer freshe
and freshemen. In the meane season while all men were together by the
cares, euer lokyng to whiche waie fortune would encline. The Erle of
Warwicke after long fight, wisely did perceiue his men to be ouer pressed,
with the multitude of his aduersaries: wherfore he caused newe men

to relief theim, that fought in the forward, by reason of whiche succors,
kyng Edwardes parte gaue a litle backe (whiche was the cause that
some lokers on, and no fighters, galoped to London, saiyng: that therle
had wonne the feld) whiche thyng when kyng Edward did perceiue, he
with all diligence, sent freshe men to their succors.
               If the battaill wer fierce and dedly before, now it was crueller, more
bloudy, more feruent and firie, and yet thei had fought from mornyng
almoste to noone, without any part gettyng auauntage of other. Kyng
Edward beyng wery of so long a conflict, and willyng to se an end, caused
a greate crewe of freshe men (whiche he had for this onely pollicie,
kepte all daie in store) to set on their enemies, in maner beyng wery and
fatigate: but although the erle sawe these newe succors, of freshe &amp; newe
men to netre the battaill, beyng nothyng afraied, but hopyng of the victory
(knowyng perfitly that there was all kyng Edwardes power) cō
                  forted
his men beyng wery, sharpely quicknyng, and earnestly desiryng
them with hardy stomackes, to bere out this last and finall brunt of the
battaill, and that the felde was euen at an ende. But when his souldiers
beyng sore wounded, weried with so long a conflict, did geue litle regard
to his wordes, he beyng a manne of a mynde inuincible, rushed into the
middest of his enemies, where as he (auentured so farre from his awne
compaignie, to kil and sley his aduersaries, that he could not be rescued)
was in the middes of his enemies, strikē doune and slain. The marques
Montacute, thynkyng to succor his brother, whiche he sawe was in
greate ieoperdy, and yet in hope to obtein the victory, was likewise ouer
throwen and slain. After the erle was ded, his parte fled and many were
taken, but not one man of name, nor of nobilitie.
               Some aucthors write, that this battaill was fought so nere hande,
that kyng Edward was constrained to fight his awne person, &amp; fought
as sore as any man of his partie, and that the erle of Warwicke, whiche
was wont euer to ride on horsebacke, from place to place, from ranke to
ranke comfortyng his men, was now aduised by the Marques his brother,
to relynquishe his horse, and trie the extremitie by hande strokes,
which if he had been on his horsebacke, might fortune to haue escaped.
               This ende had Richard Neuell erle of Warwicke,The death of therle of warwicke. whose stoutestomacke,
and inuincible corage, after so many straunge fortunes, and perilous
chaunces by hym escaped, caused death before he came to any old
age priuilie to stele on hym, and with his darte to take from hym, all
worldly and mundain affeccions: but death did one thyng, that life
could not do, for by death he had rest, peace, quietnes, and tranquillitie,
whiche his life euer abhorred, and could not suffre nor abide. On bothe
partes wer slain at this battaill, more then tenne .M. men. Of prisoners
the nomber could not be certainly knowen: on the kynges part wer slain
sir Humfrey Burchier, soonne to the Lorde Barnes, els no man of estimacion.
The occasion of this greate slaughter was, because that where
kyng Edward was wont, after the battaill obteined, to crie: saue the cō
                  mons,

and kill the capitaines, now he spared theim not, because thei not
onely so highly fauored therle of Warwicke, but also because thei came
with the erle▪ against hym in battaill. After this feld ended, the Duke of
Somerset, with Ihon erle of Oxenford, wer in all poste hast, fliyng towarde
Scotlande, but feryng the ieoperdies, that might chaunce in so
long a iorney, altered their purpose, and turned into Wales, to Iasper
erle of Penbroke: euery man fled whether his mynde serued hym. The
duke of Excester with muche difficultie, escaped into Westminster disguised,
and there toke Sanctuary. Kyng Edward after this victory, al
though he wanne it not without greate effusion of bloud, aswell on his
awne parte, as the parte of his enemies, was greatly reioysed and comforted
a
                     •
                  ter the maner of a victorious conqueroure, leadyng with hym
kyng Henry like a captiue, in moste triumphant maner, on Easter daie
at after noone, made his entery solempnly, into the citie of London, and
at the Churche of sainct Paule, he offered his standerd, and rendered to
almightie God for his greate victory, moste hūble and hartie thankes.
The ded bodies of the erle and the Marques, were brought to London
in a coffin, and before thei should bee buried, by the space of three daies,
thei laie open visaged, in the Cathedral Church of S. Paule, to thintēt
that all men might euidently perceiue, that thei vnfainedly were dedde
least perauēture the common people hereafter, here of some dissimulyng
persone, to take on hym the name of therle of Warwicke, thynkyng him
to be liuyng, might stirre a newe sedicion, &amp; excite an vnware rebellion.
               The common people saied, that the kyng was not so iocound nor so
ioyous, for the destruccion of therle, but he was more sorow
                     •
                  ull and dolorus,
for the death of the Marques, whom bothe he knewe and it appered
to other, to be inwardly his faithfull frend: For whose onely sake he
caused bothe their bodies, to bee with their auncesters, solempnly enterred
at the Priory of Bissain. In the meane season, quene Margaret hauyng
knowlege, that all thynges in Englande, were now altered and
brought into trouble and broyle, by reason of kyng Edwardes late returne
into the realme: gathered together no small compaignie, of hardy
and valiaunt souldiours, determined with all hast and diligence, with
Prince Edwarde her soonne, to saile into Englande, but yet once again
(suche was her destinie) beyng letted for lacke of prosperous wynd, and
encombered with to muche rigorous tempeste, a daie after the faire, as
the common prouerbe saieth, landed at the Port of Weymouth, in Dorset
shire. When she had passed the sea and taken lande, it was to her declared▪
how that kyng Edward had gotten again the garland, and that
kyng Henry her husband, was desolately left post a lone, and taken prisoner,
how the Erle of Warwicke and his brother were bothe slain and
ded, and all their armie destroyed, scatered or taken, and in conclusion
that her parte had susteined, the moste bitter plague and scorge, consideryng
bothe the chaūce and the tyme, that in many yeres before, had been
red or sene. When she harde all these miserable chaunces and misfortunes,
so sodainly one in anothers necke, to haue taken their effect, she like

a woman all dismaied for feare, fell to the ground, her harte was perced
with sorowe, her speache was in maner passed, all her spirites were tormented
with Malencoly. The calamitie and misery of her tyme, she detested
and abhorred, her vnstable and contrariant fortune, she stedfastly
blamed and accused, her peinfull labor, her care of mynde, turned into
infelicitie she muche lamented, and bewailed the euill fate and destenie
of her husbande, whiche eminently before her iyes, she sawe to approche
she accused, reproued, and reuiled, and in conclusion, her senses were so
vexed, and she so afflicted, and caste into suche an agony, that she preferred
death before life, rather desiryng soner to die, then lenger to liue, and
perauenture for this cause, that her interior iye sawe priuily, and gaue
to her a secrete monicion of the greate calamities and aduersities, whiche
then did hang ouer her hed, and were likely incontinent to fall and
succede (whiche other persones, neither loked for nor regarded.
               This Quene Margarete might well consider and thynke, that these
euill aduentures, chaunced to her for the moste parte, for the vnworthy
death of Humfrey Duke of Gloucester, vncle to her husbande: Of the
whiche mischaunce, although she wer not the very occasion and prouoker,
yet she greately offended in that she concented thereto, and did not
saue his life, when she rulyng all other, might conueniently haue staied
and letted it. For surely he beyng a liue, and hauyng the moderaciō and
gouernaunce of the common wealth, kyng Henry had neuer wauered in
so many hasardes, and ieoperdies of his life as he did. I would desire
of God, that all men would in egall balance, ponder &amp; indifferently consider
the causes, of these misfortunes and euill chaunces, the whiche beyng
eleuate in aucthoritie, dooe mete and measure, Iustice and iniury,
right and wrong, by high power, blynd aucthoritie, and vnbridled will.
               But nowe to the purpose, when Quene Margarete sawe, that to bid
battail was to no purpose, and in maner in dispaire, of the wealth of her
self and her sonne: she with the Prince and her compaignie, departed to
a Sainctuary there by, called Beauliew in Hamshire (where was a monastary
of Monkes, of the ordre of Cisterciens) and registered her self
and hers, as persones there priuileged. When it was knowen that she
was landed, Edmond Duke of Somerset, with lorde Ihon his brother
Thomas Courtney erle of Deuonshire, the whiche before euer toke the
contrary part, whose sodain chaungyng, shortly turned to his awne confusion,
Iasper Erle of Penbroke, Ihon Lorde Wenlocke (a man made
onely by kyng Edward) and Ihon Longstrother, Prior of sainct Ihones
in Englande, came in greate hast to Beaulew, and presented theimselfes
to the Quene: Although that she wer almoste drouned in sorowe,
and plunged in pein, yet when she sawe and beheld, these noble and princely
personages, to resort vnto her presence, she was somewhat comforted,
and greatly reuiued again.
               And first, lest it should bee laied to her charge, that she had dooen any
thyng misauisedly: she declared and shewed the cause, why she could not

come to them in time, as she gladly would haue doen, and for what purpose
and intent, she had then taken the i
                     ••
                  unitie of Sanctuary: Besechyng
them all to studie, and prouide with all diligence, for the wealthe
and conseruacion, of her onely iuell the Prince her sonne, and where for
this tyme, she dispaired to doo any thyng by force of armes, that might
bee to her profite, she thought it moste conuenient for her (if the tyme of
yere and her enemies, did not let or stop her) to saile again into Fraunce
and there to tary till God would sende her better lucke, and more pleasaunt
fortune, and to bryng her long purposed busines, to a good conclusion
and ende.
               After that the Duke and other with comfortable wordes, somewhat
had eased the dolorus harte of this vnfortunate quene: Thesaid Duke
began with a long processe, to enter communicacion of warre to be renewed,
and with all hast possible, and extreme diligence, least their compaignie
by tariyng might bee diminished, and kyng Edwardes power
encreased and augmented, consideryng that all this tyme, he had no armie
gathered together, for so muche, that at the laste battaill, the very
strength of his chief souldiours, was weaked and appalled: And that
notwithstandyng, that fortune shone on hym, in obteinyng the victory
against therle of Warwicke, yet now she might turne her saile on
the otherside, causyng hym to tast eger vineger, as she before had geuen
hym to drynke dilicate Ypocrace, when all men se daily, that of warlike
affaires at the poynt, there happeneth not seldome tyme, sodain commutacions
and vnloked variaunce: affirmyng farther, that the more nomber
of the nobilitie, bare towarde kyng Henry her husbande, their good
myndes and fixed hartes, and would help hym bothe with men and money.
And of his awne free will, if she would take vpon her, the name of
capitain agai
                     •
                  st her enemies, as she before that often tymes had enterprised:
he offered a greate power of able men, at his awne expence and
charge, promisyng that the twoo erles, should assure her of a farre greater
nomber, of valiant and expert warriers, then she would esteme. And
when he had shewed that, the victory was now (if thei liste) in their handes,
he merily required theim all, to bee of hardy harte and good chere,
and because the matter, required great expedicion, he thought it not necessary,
farther to reason the cause of battaill, but determine out of hand
how the battaill should be geuen and ordered.
               The Quene whose mynde gaue her, that this mocion, should come to
no good conclusion; answered: that she could well allowe this sentence,
if she thought that there might happen, no greater losse to some other,
then the losse of her awne life. But she suspected that while thei would
helpe thynges, that thei moste phantesied and affected, the life of prince
Edward her soonne, in whom, all the whole hope of that familie stoode
and remained, should be in perell and ieoperdie: and therfore, she either
thought it necessarie, to defer the battaill till another time, or ele to conueigh
her sonne into Fraunce again, there to lye sure and secrete, till the

chaunce of the first battayle were tried and assayed. And no marueyll,
although the naturall mother, much mynded and studied for the sauegarde
and tuycion of the lyfe of her sonne, ponderyng that next her husband,
whome she reputed for clene vndone and vtterly coste awaye, she
had nothyng more to be belo
                     •
                  ed, nothyng more derer, nor nothynge to
be made more of.
               Thus this prudent and politique Quene requyred the cheuetaynes
expert in marciall feates, that they shoulde before hande premeditate
with them selfes, maturely and deliberatly these thynges by her moued
and after that done, if they thoughte it conuenient to geue battayle, she
woulde to their agrement with all her hart be conformable. But there
was no longer disputacion of the matter, for the duke sayde that there
was no nede to waste anye more woordes for all they were determyned
(while their lyues lasted) styll to kepe warre agaynste their enemyes, &amp;
therfore that thynge whiche with greate counsayll and deliberacion is
cōcluded, ought to be auaunced and set forward with a whole consent
and agrement.
               Thus euery man together clerely bent and encouraged to ye battayle
gathered hys power by hym selfe. The duke thorough all hys dominions,
raysed a chosen companye of men of warre: lykewise did the erle of
Deuōshyre. The erle of Pēbroke wēt into Wales to his erledō to prepare
hys people with all diligence. The quene, at the last was brought
in to this hope of good fortune that she sayd, well be it, &amp; so as the duke
had aduised her, she with her company departed to Bathe, entendynge
there to make her abode, tyll more of her affinitie were together assembled.
But whether so euer she went, few or none had thereof knowlege,
mistrustyng left her consayl should by some titiuille, bee published &amp;
opened to her aduersaries, before she came to the place prefixed.
               When kyng Edward knew that Quene Margarete was landed in
Englande, and that the duke of Somerset with her complices had prepared
a new armye, out of hand he dispatched certayn cu
                     •
                  rers on 
                     •
                  ight
horses, in to euery parte to se what number hys enemyes were, &amp; what
way they entended to take. The explorators, according to theyr instruccions,
serched and soughte the partes by West, and made 
                     •
                  elacion diligently
at their retorne, what they had knowen and sent. The kynge
beyng in a great agony, because he knewe not what waye his enemyes
toke, determined, surely to encounter thē at some, one place before they
came to London. And vpon this conclusion, with such an armye as he
had gotten about London, he set forward into Oxford shyre, and there
sekynge a place apt and mete to pytche hys tentes, was conducted to
Abyndon, where he encamped hym selfe, cōmaunding all men appoynted
for the warre, with all celeritie to folow hym to that place. All the
hynges host there beyng assembled and reduct in to one company, newes
were brought to hym, that hys enemyes were come to Bathe, and
there did soiorne and tarye purposely to augmēt and encreace their nū
                  ber

of such, as dayly to them dyd resort, wherfore the kyng without delay
remoued strayght to Marleborough, beyng distāt from Bathe .xv.
miles, making haste and great diligence, if by any possibilitie he might
to geue theim battayle before they diuerted in to Wales, whether he
thought (as they entended in deed) that they would take their iorney to
ioyne them selfe with the erle of Penbroke, which had gathered a great
host in those parties.
               When the Quene knew that kynge Edwarde was come so nere to
her, she taried not long at Bathe, but remoued in greate haste to Brystow:
and sent out certayn horsemen to espye, whether she might sauely
passe ouer the Ryuer Seuerne by Gloucester into Wales, whether she
determined fyrst to go to augment her armye, and then without any delay
with spere and shelde, coragiously to set on her enemyes, where soeuer
they would abyde. They that were sent, retorned to, her agayn, declaryng
that the towne of Gloucester was vnder the obeisaunce of Rychard,
duke of Gloucester the kynges brother, and that although they
had sollicited the lord Beauchampe of Powike, which lay there in the
Castell, and had the rule of the Towne, and the townesmen fyrst by rewardesafter
by menacing, either to take their part, or peasably to suffer
her to passe ouer their bridge, they were there with all, neither once moued,
nor once would speake cōfortably to the messengers. Whē she hard
these newes, she shortly departed from Bristow with her army, to a proper
towne on seuerne syde, called Tewkesburye, leuing Gloucester vnassauted,
lest peraduēture she might their spēd her tyme wt much losse &amp;
littel gayne, but in her passage towarde Tewkesbury, the lord Beauchāpe
toke from her rereward, more ordinance then she might haue wel
spared, which did to her no small preiudice. Whē the Quene was come
to Tewkesbury, and knewe that kynge Edward folowed her with hys
horsemen at the very backe, she was sore abashed, and wōderfully amased
and determined in her selfe, to flye in to Wales to Iasper erle of Pē
                  broke:
But the duke of Somerset, willyng in nowyse to flye backward
for doughtes that he casted might chaūce by the way, determined there
to tarye, to take such fortune as God should sende, beynge in his awne
munde, and so fixed in a fayre parke, adioy
                     •
                  ynge to the towne, he pytched
hys felde agaynst the will and consent of many other Capitaynes
which would that he should haue drawen a syde, for a whyle tyl therle
of Penbroke with hys armye were with hym associate, but his will serued
for his reason, and so the chaunce folowed. The duke of Somerset
entending to abide the battayle lyke a pollitique warrior, trenched his
campe rounde about of suche an altitude, and so strongly, that his enemyes
by no meanes facilye, could make any entrie, and farther perceyuyng
that his parte coulde neuer escape without battayle, determined
there to se ye final ende of his good or yl chaūce, wherfore he marshalled
his host in this manner: he and the lord Ihon of Somerset his brother
led the forward: The middelward was gouerned by the Prynce vnder

the cōduyte of the lord of sainct Ihons, &amp; lord Wenlocke (whome kyng
Edward had highly before preferred &amp; promoted to the degre of a baron)
The rereward was put in the rule of the erle of Deuonshyre.
               When all these battayles were thus ord
                     •
                  red and placyd,The battayll of Tewkesbury
                        •
                     . the Quene
and her sonne prince Edward rode about the felde, encouragyng theyr
souldiers, promising to them (if they did shew thē selfs valyāt against
their enemyes) greate rewardes and hyghe promocions, innumerable
gayn of the spoyle and bootye of their aduersaries, and aboue all other
fame and renoune thorough the whole realme. Kyng Edward lykewise
which the day before was come within a myle of Tewkesbury, put hys
brother the duke of Gloucester in the forward, and hym selfe in the middelward,
the lord Marques and the lord hastynges led the reregarde.
The duke of Gloucester, which lacked no policye, valyantly with hys
battayle assauted the trēche of the Quenes campe, whome the duke of
Somerset with no lesse courage defended, the duke of Gloucester for a
very politique purpose, with all hys men reculed backe. The duke of
Somerset, perceiuing that: lyke a knight, more couragious then circū
                  spect
came out of his trenche, with his whole battayle, and folowed the
chace, not doubtynge but the prince and the lorde Wenlocke, with the
middelward had folowed iust at hys backe. But whether the lord Wē
                  locke
dissimuled the matter for kynge Edwardes sake, or whether hys
harte serued hym not, still he stode lokyng on. The duke of Gloucester
takynge the auantage that he auentured for, turned agayn face to face
to the duke of Somersets battayl, which (nothynge lesse thinkyng on,
then of the returne) were within a smal season, shamefully discomfited.
The duke of Somerset, seyng hys vnfortunate chaunce returned to ye
middelward, where he seyng the lord Wenloke standynge still, after he
had reuyled hym, and called him traytor, with his axe he strake ye braynes
out of his hedde. The duke of Glocester entered the trenche,A terrible stroke. &amp; after
hym the kyng, where after no lōg conflict, the Quenes part went almost
all to wrecke, for the most parte were slayne. Some sledde for succor in
the thyck of the parke, some in to ye monastery, some in to other places.
The Quene was foūde in her Chariot al most dead for sorow, ye prince
was apprehended and kepte close by syr Rychard Croftes: the duke of
Somerset and the lord Prior of sainct Ihons, were by force taken prisoners,
and many other also. In the felde &amp; chace were slaine lord Ihon
of Somerset, the erle of Deuonshyre, syr Ihon Delues, syr Edwarde
Hampden, syr Robert Wytyngham, and syr Ihon Lewkenor, and .iii.
thousande other.
               After the felde ended, kyng Edward made a Proclamatiō, that who
so euer could bring prince Edward to hym alyue or dead, shoulde haue
an annuitie of an .C.l. duryng his lyfe, and the Princes life to be saued,
Syr Richard Croftes, a wyse and a valyaut knyght, nothing mistrusting
the kynges former promyse, brought furth his prisoner prince Edward,
beynge a goodly femenine &amp; a well feautered yonge gentelman,

when kynge Edward had well aduised, he demaunded of hym, howe he
durst so presumptuously enter in to his Realme with banner displayed.
The prince, beyng bold of stomacke &amp; of a good courage, answered sayinge,
to recouer my fathers kyngdome &amp; enheritage, from his father &amp;
grandfather to 
                     •
                  ym, and from him, after him, to me lyneally diuoluted.
At which wordes kyng Edward sayd nothyng, but with his hād thrust
hym from hym (or as some say, stroke him with his gauntlet) whom incontinent,
they that stode about, whiche were George duke of Clarence
Rychard duke of Gloucester, Thomas Marques Dorset, and Williā
lord Hastynges, sodaynly murthered, &amp; pitiously manquelled. The bit

Hys body was homely enterred with y• other symple corses, in y• church
of the monastery of blacke Monkes in Tewkesburye. This was the
last ciuile battayl that was fought in kynge Edwardes dayes, whiche
was gotten the .iii. daye of Maye, in the .x. yere of hys reigne, and in the
yere of our lord .M.cccc.lxxi. then beyng Saterday. And on the Monday

remayned tyll kyng Remer her father raūsomed her with money, which
summe (as the Frenche wryters afferme) he borowed of kyng Lewes y•

dutie▪ he solde to the Frenche king &amp; his heyres, the kyngdomes of Naples,
and bothe the Sciciles, with the countye of Prouynce, which is y•
very title that kyng Charles the vii. made when he conquered y• realme
of Napels. After the raunsom payed, she was conueyed in to Fraunce
with small honor, which with so great triumphe and honorable enterteynmēt
was wt pōpe aboue al pryde, receyued into this Realme .xxviii
yeres before. And where in the beginnynge of her tyme, she lyued like a
Quene, in the middel she ruled like an empresse, toward thende she was
vexed with troble, neuer quyet nor in peace, &amp; in her very extreme age
she passed her dayes in Fraunce, more lyke a death then a lyfe, languisshyng
and mornyng in continuall sorowe, not so much for her selfe and
her husbande, whose ages were almost consumed and worne, but for the
losse of prince Edward her sonne (whome she and her husband thought
to leue, bothe ouerlyuer of their progenye, and also of their kyngdome)
to whome in this lyfe nothyng coulde be either more displeasant or greuous.
               After this battayl, kyng Edward rendered to God hys most hūble
thākes, &amp; caused publique processions to be with all deuout reuerence
solemply, kept thre dayes together in euery Towne and Parishe. And
when he had visited the townes and places, where hys enemyes assembled

first together (to the payne and punishmente of no small number)
he with good diligence returned toward London, for he was enformed
how one Thomas Neuel, bastard sonne to Thomas lord Faucōbridg
the valyant capitayne, a man of no lesse corage then audacitie (who for
his euell condiciōs was suche an apte person, y• a more meter could not
be chosen to set all the worlde in a broyle, &amp; to put the estate of y• realme
on an yll hasard) had of new begonne a great cōmocion. This bastard
was before this tyme appoynted by the erle of Warwycke, to be Uiceadmyrall
of the sea, and had in charge so to kepe the passage betwene
Douer and Caleys, that none which either fauored kynge Edward or
hys frendes should escape, vntaken or vndrouned. And when by the
death of the erle of Warwycke, he was broughte into pouertie, he robbed
both on the sea &amp; the lande, aswel hys enemyes as also his frendes:
By reason wherof he gat together a great nauy of shippes, and spoiled
on euery shyp, and at laste toke lande in Kent, and gathered together a
great company of Kentishmen, such as were most mete for his purpose,
and so marched toward London, where the Essex men hauynge wylde
whaye wormes in their heddes, ioined them with him, saiyng that their
commyng and quarell was to deliuer out of captiuitie Kyng Henry y•
vi. and to bryng hym to hys wyfe, but what so euer their outward wordes
were, their inward cogitacions were onely hope of spoyle, and desyre
to robbe and pyll. For the bastarde hym selfe assaulted the drawe
bridge of London, and a capitain of his called Spisyng scaled Algate
with the Essex mē, harnesed in their wyfes Chesecloutes, which assaultes
were deadly geuen and manfully resisted, in so much that on bothe
partes many were slayne and hurt, but at the last the citiezens then put
backe the rebelles, and 
                     •
                  lew and wounded a great number of them, and
draue the bastard from al hys pray to his shyppes, lyeng at Radcleffe,
which hauyng a good &amp; prosperous wynde, made sayle with all haste, &amp;
Roued on the sea, as before he was accustomed.
               This styrryng, although it were but littell to thynke on at the fyrst
yet if it had begonne not long afore, it had brought all kynge Edwardes
busines in to a doubtfull difference: for kynge Edward in these hys
last battayles was twise more then fortunate for that, that he at sondry
and seuerall tymes (and not all a
                     •
                   one tyme) was persecuted &amp; inuaded
of his enemyes: for surely, at the tyme when the erle of Warwycke with
his pytched armye was comyng toward London, if quene Margarete
with her companye had takē lande (which enterprice she thryse in great
ieopardy coragiously attempted) Then if she had set on behynd, whyle
the erle of Warwycke gaue the onset before bothe at one moment, or if
Edmond duke of Somerset had not geuen battayle at Tewkesburye,
before Iasper erle of Penbroke was come with his trayne, or if bastard
Fawconbridge had vexed the Londeners euen at y• tyme: One or the other
of these .ij. thynges should consequently haue folowed, that kynge
Edwarde muste of necessitie once agayne flye out of the Realme, or els

with shame and rebuke yelde hym selfe, either to slaughter or captiuitie:
But as in all meane chaunces and small gaynes, good lucke is desyred
and praysed, so much more in battayle, is good fortune and fortunate
chaunce to be most made of, and chiefly to be auaunced.
               Now to returne to bastard Faucōbridge, waueryng hither &amp; thither
in the doubfull surges of the sea, as sure of his lyfe on the water as on
the lande, which either thynking that no man woulde se hym, or that al
men were blynd, and coulde not espie hym (and especially in so secret a
place) came into the open hauen of Southampton, and there toke lāde
where he was not long vntaken, but shortlier behedded.
               When Iasper erle of Pēbroke was credibly asserteyned that quene
Margarete had lost the battayle at Tewkesburye, and that there was
no more trust of any comfort or releue to be had for the parte of poore
kyng Henry, he with such men of warre as he was, bringyng to his cō
                  federates,
returned backe out of y• way to the towne of Chepstow, wher
he taryeng deploryng and lamentyng, that hast to much hasted, &amp; that
vnpurueied &amp; blynd will had at the finall conclusiō, not only destroyed
and brought to nought al kyng Heryes estate, riches and preheminēce,
but further had left all his frendes redy to tosse the waues of fortune, &amp;
to seke their lyuyng where thy might sauely get them, began to thinke
and prouide what way was best to take.
               Kyng Edward at this season, not beynge out of feare of the erle of
Penbroke▪ sente priuely in too Wales, Roger Uaughan, a man there
bothe stronge of people and of frendes, to the entent by some gyle or engyne
sodaynly to trap and surprise the erle: but he hauyng intelligence
of certayne frendes, how that watche was priuilie leyd for him, sodainly
in thesame towne, toke Roger Uaughan, and without delay stroke of
hys hed, so Thomas Uaughan, by Gods prouidēce, receyued the death
hymselfe, which he by deceipt prepared for the other.
               The erle in good hast departed thence to Penbroke, whome incontinent
Morgan Thomas, by kyng Edwardes cōmaundemēt so strōgly
beseged hym, and so enuyroned his Castell with a diche and a trenche,
that he coulde not lightly flye or escape thence: but he was after eyghte
dayes deliuered, and the seage raysed by hys faythfull and trusty frendes
Dauid Thomas, brother to the foresayd Morgan, and from thēce
conueyed to Tynbye, a hauen towne in wales, where he getting conuenient
shyppes, for to transport hym and hys ouer the sea into Fraunce
with hys nephew lord Henry erle of Rychemonde, and a few of hys familiers
toke shyp, and by fortunes leadyng, landed in Brytayne.
               After hys arryuall, he fyrst went to duke Fraūces of Brytayne, and
hym reuerently saluted, expoundyng to hym the cause, the cace, and the
necessitie of their thether commyng, committyng the lyfes, the goodes
and all the chaunces both of hym and hys nephew, whole to the dukes
discrecion and ordinaunce. The duke receyued bothe the erles, with all
benignitie, and shewed to thē no lesse honor, fauor and humanitie, with

suche entertainment, then if thei had been his naturall brethren, and geuyng
to theim his faithe, seriously made promise that beyng with hym,
thei should sustein no maner of wrong, nor no iniurie should be to them
by any creature offred: assuryng them, that thei might within his dominions,
at all tymes, and in all places, go in safe and good suretie.
               When Kyng Edwarde had appeased, by the meanes afore rehersed,
his kyngdome and people, to the intent that there should insurge hereafter,
no newe commocion within the realme again: he made a iorney into
Kente, and there sat in iudgement on suche, as in the last tumulteous

was come into the realme, and that all feare of exterior hostilitie, was
banished and exiled for euer: Poore kyng Henry the sixte, a litle before
depriued of his realme, and Imperiall Croune, was now in the Tower
of London,Kyng Henry the

of Gloucester (as the constant fame ranne) whiche, to thintent that kyng
Edward his brother, should be clere out of all secret suspicion of sodain
inuasion, murthered thesaid kyng with a dagger. But whosoeuer was
the manqueller of this holy man, it shall appere, that bothe the murtherer
and the consenter, had condigne and not vndeserued punishement,
for their bloudy stroke, and butcherly acte: and because thei had now no
enemies risen, on whom thei might reuenge themself, as you shall hereafter
perceiue, thei exercised their crueltie, against their awne selfes:
and with their proper bloud, embrued and polluted their awne handes
and membres.
               The ded corps of kyng Henry, with billes and gleues pompeously (if
you call that a funerall pompe) was conueighed from the tower, to the
Churche of saincte Paule, and there laied o

of Chertesey, beyng distant from London .xv. mile, and there was
buried, but after he was remoued to Winsore, and there in a new vawte

honest conuersacion and pure integritie, no knower of euill, and a keper
of all goodnes: a dispiser of all thynges, whiche bee wonte to cause, the

but for that, rendered to almightie God, his creator, hartie thankes,
thynkyng that by this trouble, and aduersitie, his synnes were to
hym forgotten and forgeuen. What shal I saie, that this good, this gē

this meke, this sober, and wisman, did declare and affirme, that those
mischiefes and miseries, partly, came to hym for his awne offence, and

sound an offence toward God, he loked on that, and not without repentaunce,

to thintent that no print or shadowe, should remain of the
aduerse faccion, in his realme. He diligently required
and serched out, all the fragmentes and leuynges, of his
enemies parte, intendyng to represse, and vtterly to extinguishe theim.
And first to begyn with all, he sent George Neuell, brother to the erle of
Warwicke, and Archbushoppe of Yorke, vnder strong conduite, to the

Castle of Guysnes, there to be kept in extreme captiuitie, where he long
continued, and at the laste, by frendship deliuered: whiche of very pensiuenes
and grudge of mynd, shortely after deceassed, whom, Laurence
Bathe, and after hym Thomas Rotheram, in the sea of Yorke, did ordinarily
succede. Beside this, Ihon Erle of Oxenford, whiche after Barnet
feld, bothe manfully gat, and valiantly kept, sainct Mighels Moūt
in Cornewal: either for lacke of aide, or perswaded by his frendes, gaue
vp the Mount, and yelded hymself to kyng Edward, (his life onely saued)
whiche to hym was graunted: but to be out of all doubtfull imaginacions,
kyng Edward sent hym ouer the sea, to the Castle of Hammes,
where by the space of .xii. yeres, he was in strong prison, miserably kept,
and diligently looked to. Many other beside these, in diuerse partes of
the realme, beyng very litle or nothyng suspected: wer either committed
to prison, or greuosly fined and taxed. Beside this, least his neighbors
countrey, might be an harborough, or receptacle of his foes and aduersaries,
he concluded a newe league, with Iames the .iii. kyng of Scottes,
for the terme of .xx. yeres. And yet, whatsoeuer he thought in his Imaginacion,
for all his besy diuises, and pollitique forcastynges: his
mynd and phantesie, wer not clere exonerate and dispatched, of all feare
and inward trouble: For tidynges wer brought to hym, that the erles of
Penbroke and Richemond, were arriued in Britayne: and there of the
Duke, highly cherished, well fostered and entertained.

                  THis thyng nipped kyng Edwarde hardly at the verie stomacke,
as though his mynd, castyng some euill to come after:
did signifie before, that the Erle of Richemond, should
once attein to the Croune and diademe of the realme: whiche
mischief, when he had wel disgested, he secretly sent wise
and close messengers, to the Duke of Brytayne, the whiche should not
sticke, to promise the duke, great &amp; sumpteous rewardes, (knowing that
mede, many thynges corrupteth) so that he would deliuer, bothe therles
into their handes and possession. The duke gladly hard them that were
sent▪ but when he knewe, the twoo Erles to bee a praie, of suche a greate
value, he determined not to deliuer theim, but rather to entertain theim
with hym more diligently, then thei were accustomed. The duke answered
the orators, that it stoode not with his honor, nor he would not deliuer
the twoo Erles, to whom, he was bounde and obliged, by his faithe
and promise: but this he promised to dooe for the kynges pleasure, that
thei should be kept, and with suche vigilant persones, continually watched,
that the kyng should haue no maner of cause, once to thynke, that
thei could or should attempt any thyng, that might sounde, either to his
displeasure or preiudice. When the messengers sawe, that thei could not
obtein, that whiche thei desired, like wisemen held themselfes contented
with that, whiche by the duke was offered, &amp; so returned into England.

The kyng wrote to the Duke of Britayne, louyngly requiryng hym, to
accomplishe with all spede, that, whiche he of his awne mocion offered,
promisyng hym not onely, menne and greate rewardes, but yerely to rewarde
hym, with a full hande, and a well stuffed purse. The Duke perceiuyng
the swete gain, whiche rose to hym, by the abode of the two Englishe
Erles▪ in his Countrey: least thei for any cause, should abandon
his dominions, and seke succors in some other forrein Region, caused
the one, to be segregated from the other: and remoued from theim suche
Englishemen, as wer daily on them attendant and came with theim into
Britayn, and in their places appoynted Britons, to be their seruitors
to minister, and continually to attend and waite on theim.
               When kyng Edward had thus pollitiquely, as he thought, compassed
the Duke of Britayne: he thynkyng nothyng lesse, then to take a damage
at the Duke of Burgoynes hand, yea, and suche a damage, as by

                  op, and puttyng
backe of the commodities, growen within this realme, to be transported
into outward partes North Estward, was yet eft sones, brought
into a newe doubte and perplexitie. For the declaracion whereof, you
muste vnderitande, that Lewes the Frenche kyng, had a brother called
Charles, whiche was not the wisest, nor yet a man of the greatest experience:
and of a certain curtesie, loued better to haue other menne to rule
hym, then he to take vpō hym to rule other. And although that the kyng
at this tyme, had no soonne, nor other brother, but hym, his open heire
apparant: he litle fauored, and 
                     •
                  esse loued hym, nothyng geuyng hym of
his good will, for his part and porciō, of his fathers landes, but that, to
the whiche he was cōpelled by his counsaill, and that he gaue hym this
moneth, in the next moneth, he would by flatery or by thretnyng, by war
or corrupcion of his brothers seruauntes, obtain &amp; bring to his handes
and possession again. For first he gaue him the Duchie of Berry, &amp; after
that whole Normandy, wherof in no long tyme, he bereft him the possession,
regiment &amp; title, without any cause geuē, on y• partie of yong Charles.
And when thesaid Charles, had afterward departed, with the countreys
of Brye &amp; Champaigne, by a fraudulent feate: kyng Lewes caused
hym to 
                     •
                  elinquishe thesame, &amp; to take for his parētage, the duchie of
Guyen, &amp; so was called &amp; named the duke of Guyen. This euil entreating
of the duke of Guyen, by the Frēch kyng his brother, caused diuerse
other Princes, of no small puyssaunce, to fauor, aide, and succor thesaid
Duke (of the whiche the chief wer, Charles Duke of Burgoyn, Fraunces
duke of Britayn, &amp; Lewes Erle of sent Poll, Con
                     ••
                  able of Fraunce.
This Duke of Guyen, by the sollicityng of his adherentes, sore labored
to haue in mariage, the sole daughter and onely heire, of Charles duke
of Burgoyne, by whom he hoped to be lorde and souereigne, of all duke
Charles inheritauuce. To the furtheraunce of this mariage, holpe with
all his power, the Duke of Britayn, as who saied, that it should be onely

his acte. The Constable of Fraunce on the other parte, thought that
he a lone, was able to compasse this mariage, and to haue soly the thankes,
of the Duke of Guyen. The Frenche kyng did all that he could, to
let and stoppe this mariage: for if his brother had obteined, the young
Lady with all her possessions, then he sawe well inough, that the Duke
of Guyen, beyng ioyned with the Duke of Britayne, should bee strong
inough, or at the least of puyssaunce inough, to encomber the Frenche
kyng and his children. But kyng Edwarde of Englande, sore smoked,
when he hard tell first of this mariage, and not without a cause: For he
considered, that the Frēche kyng had no heire maile, but one weake boy
and that the Duke of Guyen, was likely to were the Croune of Fraūce,
after his brother or nephewe. And if this ma
                     •
                  age should procede, all
Burgoyn, Brabant, Holand, Zeland, Flaunders, and all the lowe countreys,
where the Englishe men, for the moste parte, made their martes,
and vttered their their merchaundise, should be vnited and annexed, to
the Croune of Fraunce, and in the handes of the old, and auncient enemies
of the realme: For so had poore England, and litle Caleis, been cō
                  tinually
in the daunger of their enemes, almoste with theim enui
                     •
                  oned
rounde aboute. These thinges considered, kyng Edward and his counsaill,
tooke the matter in greate earnest, and seriously wrote to Duke
Charles, that if he would conculde, any mariage in Fraunce, to the hurt
and preiudice, of the realme of Englande▪ that he should knowe that he
had, not onely broken his league and amitie, but also finde, that he had
been better to haue dissimuled, with the best frende that he had, then priuily,
without reason, to haue iuggeled with the realme of England. The
Duke of Burgoyn made reasonable answeres, and honest excuses, but
the Counsaill of Englande, in nowise would geue credite thereto: euer
surmising that the mariage should take 
                     •
                  ffect. And certainly at this season,
the Englishemen had rather haue taken part, with the French kyng
then with the Duke of Burgoyne: if it had not been onely, to empeche
and stoppe this mariage, so muche the Englishemen disdained, to haue
the house of Burgoyne, conioyned and vnite, to the Croune of Fraunce.
But the Duke of Burgoyne dalied, and dissimuled with all parties, in
this matter, geuyng them faire wordes, and makyng large promises, by
the whiche he first deceiued other, &amp; incōclusion himself. He promised his
daughter, to Nicholas Duke of Calaber, with whō, he had rather haue
had her buried, then 
                     •
                  edded. Duke Philbert of Sauoy, had an outward
answere assuredly, when nothyng was so mynded inwardly. Maximilian
Duke of Austrice, and after kyng of Romaines, soonne to the
Emperor Fredericke, could neuer obtein, duryng the life of duke Charles,
but onely glosyng and painted promises: but all wordes, writynges
and promises, what so euer thei wer, clerely set a side, he was surely fixed
and determined (as Argēton his counsailer doth write) that no mariage
as long as he liued, should sort to any effecte, at the least by his consent.
               Now lette vs leue the Duke of Burgoyne, aboute his affaires for a

all thynges, whiche were out of square: Charles
duke of Burgoyn, whose spirite was neuer in quiet, whose
ambicious mynde, was neuer satisfied, whose haute and
high stomacke, could neuer be tamed, (till death it swaged
and abated) desiryng aswell to amplify, and enlarge his territories and
dominiōs, liyng on the side of the riuer of Ryne, toward high Burgoyn
as also to recouer again Amias and other tounes, whiche the Frenche
kyng, more by fraude then by feates of warre, had from hym wrongfully
vsurped: and further aboue all thynges, couetyng to haue the Frēche
kyng, to haue some greate shame, losse, or hinderaunce, could not inuent
no one waie, so apt and mete for his imagined purpose, as to entice and
perswade the kyng of Englande, by his ambassadors, to make warre vpon
thesaied kyng and his countrey: for the recoueryng of his old right
and auncient title in thesame, by the Frenche kyng &amp; his father, against
all right and equitie, with holden and deteig
                     •
                  ed. Kyng Edward began
a litle to harken on that side, not so muche for to help the Duke of Burgoyne
(to whom he was muche bounde, for his aide in the tyme of his
exile, as you before haue harde) as for to be reuenged of kyng Lewes,
whom, he reputed for his mortall enemie. Firste, for aydyng the Erle of
Warwicke and his complices, against hym: secondarely, for the long
mainteinyng, and fosteryng of Quene Margarete, and her soonne

prince Edwarde (whome for a farther affinitie, he had made Godfather
to hys sonne Charles the Doulphyn) within his coūtreys &amp; dominiōs.
Whereupon, when he had consulted with the nobilitie and the chiefe
and sage persons of the Realme (which in manner haue a certayn naturall
inclination to make warre in Fraūce, either for hope of great spoyle
and gayne, or of a certayne priuie canker engendered in the hartes of
their forefathers, in tyme long past, and after by lyneall succession descended
in to the stomackes of their nephewes) he aunswered the Dukes
messenger, that in the beginnyng of the yere, he would lande at Caleys
with such a puissant army, that the Frenche kyng should well perceyue
that he lacked neither men, nor that hys men lacked stomackes, bothe
for to reuenge their soueraygnes quarell, and also to recouer his right.
And for a treugth, at thys season there was mortal warre betwene king
Lewes and the duke of Borgoyne. And more likely to fal betwene him
and other, for kyng Lewes, of nature was hard of speche, and chorlish
in answere, froward and vngentell aswel to hys frendes as to his foes.
By reason whereof many great men within the realme of Fraunce, not
content with his grosse rudenesse, and rude diss
                     ••
                  ulaciō began to haue
intelligens, and to cleue to the duke of Borgoyn, emongest whom was
Lewes of Luxenborough, erle of sainct Pol, and Constable of Fraunce
which beyng confedered with the duke and other noble men, determined
so to vex and scorge kyng Lewes with some plague, by the whiche
other he should be transformed in to a man, clere altered from his olde
qualities, or els should be in ieopardye, bothe of losse of lyue &amp; realme,
for it was determined that Fraunce shoulde bee set on assaulted, bothe
with outward enemyes, and inward diss
                     ••
                  ulers. All these thynges the
duke of Borgoyne with kyng Edward, dyd communicate to the entent
the soner to allure and prouoke hym, to enterprise the warre, according
to hys desyre. These thynges, as tokens of victorie, before animated
kyng Edward, and enforced hym in maner to make warre on Fraunce
and so with all expedicion prepared all thynges necessarie, bothe for water
and lande. And because no small summe of money was sufficient for
so great a charge, and that the money the yere before to hym auaunced
by the realme, was consumed in hys houshold, and other necessarye affayres,
he conceyued a new deuice in hys imaginacion, by the which engine
he might couertly perswade and entice hys ryche frendes, to geue
and graunt him some conuenient summe of money, toward his ine
                     ••
                  able
charges, and incredible costes, which thing, if they did not willingly assent
to, he then would impute to thē greater ingratitude, and more vnkyndnes,
wherupon he caused hys officers to bryng to him the most ryche
persons one after another. And to them he explaned the cause, &amp; the
purpose, and the necessitie of the warre begon, and the fayntnesse &amp; leuenesse
of hys treasure, and the great &amp; importion lacke of money, hartely
requyring them for their loue and affeccion, that always they had born
to hym, beyng their natural Prince, of their awne gratuitie and frewill

to geue to hym some ayde or money, for mayntenance of his warre and
army: what should I say more: This inuencion came to this effect, that
some calling to their remembraūce, the benefites of hym receyued, some
with shame, some with feare moued and encouraged, gaue to hym liberally
bothe of their substaūce and treasure, whiche without grudge he
coulde not haue otherwise obteyned. But here I wil not let passe a prety
conceyt, that happened in this gathering, in the which you shall not
onely note the humilitie of a kynge, but more the fantasie of woman.
Kyng Edward had called before hym a wydow, muche aboundynge in
substance, and no lesse growen in yeres, of whome he merely demaunded
what she gladly woulde geue him towarde his greate charges? By my
treuth quod she, for thy louely countenance thou shalt haue euen .xx.l.
the kyng lokyng scace for the halfe of that summe, thanked her, and louingly
kyst her, whether the flauor of his brethe did so cōfort her stommacke,
or she estemed the kysse of a kynge, so precious a iuell, she swore
incontinently, that he should haue .xx.l. more, whiche she with the same
will payed that she offered it. The kyng willing to shew that this benefite
was to hym much acceptable, and not worthy to be put in obliuion
called this graunt of money a beneuolence, not withstāding that many
with grudge &amp; maleuolēce gaue great summes toward that new foūde
beneuolence: But the vsing of such gētill fashions toward them, wyth
frendly prayer of their assistance in his necessitie, so tempted theim that
they could none otherwise do, but frankely and frely yelde &amp; geue hym
a reasonable reward.

                  WHen all thynges conuenient for suche an enterprise were
in a redynesse. Kynge Edwarde with his army remoued to
Douer, where he founde .v.C. shyppes and Hoyes, redy to
transport hym &amp; hys army ouer the sea: And so he hym selfe
 wt his nobilitie warlikely accōpaignied, passed ouer betwene
Douer &amp; Caleys, the .iiij. daye of Iuly, and landed at Caleys wyth
great triumphe, hys army, horses and munycons of warre, scace passed
ouer in .xx. dayes (whome the Frenchmen bragged, should haue ben taken,
if they had wel considered the chaūce before, as they knew it after)
When kyng Edward with all his army royall, was without any trouble
landed, and in suertie, he caused euery man, accordyng to his degre,
to be ordered &amp; lodged. This armye, by the wrytinge of Argenton, was
the fayrest and the strongest armye that passed out of Englande in too
Fraunce many yeres before, for the men were so well armed, and so surely
in all thynges appoynted &amp; prouided, that the Frenche naciō were
not onely amased to behold them, but much more praysed them &amp; there
oder. In thys army were .xv.C. men of armes well horsed, of the which
the most parte were barded &amp; rychely trapped, after the moste galiard
fashion, hauyng many horses decked in one suyte. There were farther

xv.M. archers, beryng bowes &amp; arrowes, of the whiche a greate parte
were on horsebacke. There were also a great number of fighting men &amp;
other, aswell to set vp Tentes and Pauilions (where of the Englishmē
had great plenty) as to serue their Artilarie, and to enclose their campe,
or otherwise to labor. And in all this army there was not one page.
               The kyng of England was at his arryuall highly displeased wyth
the duke of Borgoyn, which in the worde of a Prince, promised hym to
mete him at his landing with .ij.M. men of armes &amp; light horsemē, besyde
a great number of Lanceknightes &amp; Halberders, &amp; that he would
haue begonne the warre .iii. monethes before the kynges transportyng,
the more to vex and greaue the Frēch kyng, &amp; to cause him seke his wittes.
The duke of Borgoyn at this season, lay at seage before the strōge
towne of Nuyce, with a puissant army, agaynst whome ware assembled
the Emperor Frederike, and almost the whole Empire for to rescow of
the towne, to whome the kyng of England sent the lord Scales in post,
requyring hym to leaue his voyd seage before the impregnable towne
of Nuyce, and to retorne in all hast with his people and army to make
warre in Fraunce, according to his promise and othe, declaring farther
that the tyme passed, &amp; the Somer woulde be lost, with this charge the
lord Scales departed in all hast toward the duke, whome we wil leue,
rydinge toward Nuyce for a whyle.
               O Fraunce Fraūce, how much art thou bounde to laude &amp; prayse the
Sauior for the deliuerance, in the tyme of thy afflicciō. For i
                     •
                   God had
not permitted the cancard hart of the duke, to be indurate, nor his weke
brayne to be vexed, nor yet his ambicious affeccion to bee enflamed, so
that he with all his power had ioyned with the army of England on y•
one syde, hauyng on their syde the duke of Brytayn with his power.
               These thre princes had bene lyke to haue make Fraunce, either to bow
or to breke, either to yelde or to suffer the chaunces of fortune, which she
lyke a wauering Goddes, had prouided for her punishment. Before
kyng Edward departed from Douer, he sent to the Frenche kynge an
officer of armes (whome Argenton vntrewly calleth Garter borne in
Normandy, for the rome of Gartier was neuer geuen to no estraunger)
which Herault deliuered to the French kynge with all dew reuerence a
letter of diffiance, bothe for the stile &amp; the pennyng excellently endited,
which the Frenchmen would scant beleue to be framed by an Englishman.
The letter requyred the Frēch king to render to the king of Englande,
the realme of Fraunce to him of right, &amp; by lyneall enheritaunce
aperteyning &amp; belonging, to thentēt that he might put agayn y• church,
the nobilitie, and the commons into their auncient estates, &amp; liberties, &amp;
to disburdē &amp; exonerate them of the great charges, trauayles &amp; labors,
that they now were in. And in case y• he did refuse so to do, then he dyd
protest the harme that should ensue, in the forme &amp; maner, that in suche
a case is requise and accustumed to be done. Kyng Lewes red the letter
secretly to him selfe, &amp; after all alone in a great study withdrew him self

into hys warderobe, &amp; sending for the English Herault, sayd to h
                     •

I know, and wel wot, y• the kyng of Englād your master, is neither descended
in these partes of his awne fre mocion, nor yet of vs requyred,
but onely entised &amp; prouoked by the duke of Burgoyn, and somewhat
enforced by the cōmons of his Realme. But now you may se that y• season
of the yere passeth, &amp; the duke of Burgoyn is in poore estate, returning
from Nuyce all most discōforted. The Cōstable also, with whome
the kyng your souereygne lord, I am sure hath some intelligence, for fauor
that your master hath maried his nece, is not so sure a 
                     •
                  rende as he
is taken for, &amp; if all the world knew how I haue promoted him, &amp; what
I haue done for him, they would littel thynk, that he would so vntrewly
handle me as he dothe, for I assure you, he is a depe dissimuler, &amp; in continual
dissimulacion, entendeth to lede his lyfe, entertayning all mē for
his awn profit. And although y• kyng your master, be vnsure of all hys
other promises, yet of one thing he shall be sure, that is, he shal be euer
dissimuled with all, &amp; therfore I say to you, and not to your master, y•
he were better haue a peace with an olde enemye, then the promises and
familiaritie of a new dissimuling frede, which peace most pleaseth God,
and is the thinge that I most do desyre. When he had sayd, he gaue to
the Herault .iii.C. crounes, promisinge hym a .M. crounes, if any good
apoyntement came to passe. The Herault beyng more coueteous of the
crounes, then secret, according to the duetie of his office, promised to do
all thinges that in him lay, not doubting, but that the kyng his master
would be conformable to any reasonable offer, aduisinge the Frenche
kyng (after kyng Edward were once landed) to send to him an Herault,
to fetche a saue conduyte &amp; pasport, for such as should labor &amp; trauayle
in that treatie. And that the sayd Herault should first resort to the lord
Stanley, or to the lord Haward, for the cōducting of him to the kinges
presence, when the Herault should depart, the kynge gaue him a pece of
of Crymosen Ueluet of .xxx. yardes long, commaundinge &amp; strayghtly
chargyng, that no man should be so hardy once to cōmen with him, but
to let hym passe in all gentel fashiō. When the Herault was gone, king
Lewes callyng to him .vii. or .viii. of his familiers, caused the letter too
be red, of the whiche he was but a littel afrayd &amp; lesse abashed, considering
the English Herault had shewed him playnly, how to enter into y•
port of the treatie, &amp; in maner how to gayne &amp; conquere the fortresse, of
which enformacion he was not a littel ioyous, &amp; wisely and secretly according
to thesame, when he saw his tyme, he prosecuted his purpose.
In this very season, the lord Scales came to the duke of Burgoyn before
Nuyce, accompting to hym his message, as he was commaunded.
The duke of Burgoyn, beyng so sore set to cōquere the town of Nuyce,
aunswered the lord Scales, that his honor was lost, and shame should
be spoken of him thorough all Christendom, if he should rayse his feld
and breke hys seage, but he hoped shortly to gayne the towne, and then
with triumphāt victory, to come to ayde kyng Edward with his whole

army: with thys answere y• lord S
                     •
                  ales departed, which onely answere
was comen without any other augmentacion, to all such as kyng Edward
sent, to haue the duke to kepe his promes. What a folye was this
in duke Charles, to besege a towne impregnable, euen at thesame tyme
when the Englishmen at his request had passed the sea, which thyng all
the tyme of his regiment, he had bothe traueled in, and sore requyred,
and neuer coulde compasse tyll this season, and also all thinges beyng
well disposed for hys purpose, both in Brytayn and in other places, except
he more regarded to conquere a new towne, then to defende all hys
olde possessions and seigniories. But shortly after by the Bishoppe
of Romes authoritie, he left Nuyce vnconquered, but lesyng a great nū
                  ber
of his people, and the remnaūt he sent into Lorayne and Barroys,
there to lye and trouble duke Reyner of Lorayn, whiche a littel before
had defied hym, lyeng before Nuyce. And he him self with a small company,
came to kyng Edward before Caleys, with whom kyng Edward
at the fyrst comming, began somwhat to be greued, laiyng to his charg
that at hys mocion, request and desyre, he with all hys army had passed
the seas onely to the entent with mortal warre, to plague and scourge
the proude realme of Fraunce. And that he leuyng all thynges (whiche
should molest or trouble the Frenche kyng) a parte, applied hym selfe
to matters of Lorayne, and externe nacions, more then to reuenge the
open iniuries to him done by hys neyghbor the Frenche kynge. The
duke excused hym selfe wyth ieoparding the losse of hys honor, if he had
returned from Nuyce, and also that of necessitie, he was compelled too
leue hys armye in Lorayne, to be reuenged ouer duke Reyner, whiche
had hym before Nuyce with spytefull wordes and raylyng termes defied
and detested: affirmyng farther, that nowe in the beginnynge with
a small companye, a great enterprice myght be gayned. In profe wherof
he deliuered to the kynge, letters of credence, sent frome the Constable
of Fraunce, which willed the kyng to geue credite and perfait faith
to the duke. In makyng relacion of suche secretes as were to hym geuen
in charge to declare to the kynges awne person, fyrste he shewed
that all though the Constable had promised to the kyng and the duke,
to rēder vp to them the towne of sainct Quintynes, yet it had not come
to so good effect, if it had bene yelded, the duke beynge in Germany, as
it now shall, the kynge and the duke beynge bothe personally presente,
at the deliuerāce. Wherfore he exhorted the kyng to set forward, and to
display hys banner, and set furth hys standard. And so by hys mocion,
the kyng accompanied with the duke, hys armye departed out of Caleys,
and passed by Boleyne to Perone, where the Englishmen thought
them selfes of the duke, more lyke enemyes then frendes to be enterteyned,
for at the gates entered but a few that were apoynted, the remnant
lodged in the feldes, better purueyed of their awne, then of the dukes
prouision.
               The kyng of England, thinkyng surely, and fyrmely beleuyng that

the Constable ment all treuthe, and the soner enduced to that credence
because the Constable was great Uncle to the Quene his wyfe, where
in very dede, he nothing lesse mynded then trouthe, remoued his campe
from Peron, the Duke of Borgoyn, beyng in hys army, and marched
toward saynct Quintynes: certayne Englishmen ran before the toune,
agaynst whose commyng they thought that the belles should haue benrong,
and the gates set open. But whē they aproched the toune, the artillarie
beganne to shote, and they of the toune came out bothe on fote
and horsbacke, and skyrmished with the Englishmen, of whiche two or
thre were slayne. This welcome semed very straunge to kyng Edward
ponderynge together yestardayes promise, and two dayes doyng. The
duke woulde not that the kyng should desist from hys purpose, because
the toune was not yelded at the sight of a handfull of people, whyche
thyng he sayd, although the Constable woulde gladly haue done, at
the first, but yet he woulde haue a couler to do it, as thoughe it should
papere that he did it by verye conpulsion and force: and therefore, if the
kynge woulde make but semblance to besege the toune, he wou
                     •
                  d warrant,
that incontinent it should be rendered. The kynge of Englande,
perceyuyng that he was deluded in his first enterprice, thought it more
surer to heare the fayre wordes of the Constable, and the duke, then to
geue credit to theyr vntrew and disceatfull doynges. The Englishemen
returned to theyr campe, very yl content, as I can not blame them
murmeryng agaynst the Constable, callynge hym Traytor, periured &amp;
vntrew gentelman. Besyde this angre, ther came the next daye another
corsey, that smarted a littell sorer, for duke Charles of Borgoyne, by
whose meanes kynge Edward had taken vpon hym this warre, either
perceyued that all the Constables promises were but fayre sunne shynyng,
swetely spoken, and sowerly performed, or els he saw that he hym
selfe lacked men or money, to procede farther with kyng Edward in his
iorney: toke hys leaue sodaynly of the kyng of Englande, saiynge that
he must nedes visite, and se hys armye in Berroys, promisinge shortly
with all puissance to returne agayne to the great auantage and cōmoditie
of them bothe, and so in hast departed.
               This departyng was bothe displeasaunt and straunge to the king
of Englande, considering that in hope to haue the duke hys continuall
felow in armes, and too haue hys counsayll in the order of hys people
(whiche of late had not frequented the warre of Fraunce, nor yet perfitly
knewe the force, the agilitie and the maner of the Frenche nacion)
had passed the seas, raysed his standard, and by dukes procurement entered
into the lande of hys enemyes, and nowe to be left alone withoute
guyde or leder, without ayde or succor in the middell of hys foes, he
coulde no lesse thynke, but that the duke neither vsed hym lyke a prince
nor yet kept hys promes lyke a trewe man, whyche vnstable and dissimulyng
workynge, caused, ye, and rather enforced kyng Edward, both
to thynke that he neuer thought, and to do that he neuer entēded to do.

The Englishe men sore murmured against the Constable, and no lesse
against the duke, sauyng thei determined, neuer to geue confidēce to the
Constables wordes, and greatly doubted, whether thei might geue any
credite to the dukes promise. Thus laie thenglishmen in the feldes whē
the cold nightes begā to waxe long, without any gain of cōquest, which
caused the common people, which be not alwaies content with hardnes
rather to desire to returne homewarde, then to procede any daies iorney
forward. The French kyng whiche was bothe wily &amp; wittie (and especially
for his awne purpose) knewe by his espials, y• vntrue refusall made
by the Constable, the vnfrendly departyng of the Duke of Burgoyne,
and the daily murmuryng of thenglishemen, against them bothe, wherfore
he thought nowe, that it was verie expedient, to folowe the counsaill
of the Englishe Herault, in sendyng for a saueconduite, for metyng
of Ambassadors, to common of a treatie, if it might bee well compassed.
But yet to auoyde all doubtes, he reised an armie, and the more he perceiued,
the power of his enemies to encrease, the more he studied, how by
power to resist theim, and ouer that armie he made capitain, Monsire
Robert de Estoteuile a valiaunt man, whom, he sent into Artoys, to defende
the Frountiers there, against the kyng of Englandes entree and
inuacions: and he hymself taried still at Senlis. The Frenche kyng beyng
thus priuilie desirous of peace, although he outwardly shewed the
countenaunce of Mars: meanyng quietnes, and settyng furthe warre,
caused a varlet to be subornated, in a cote armure of Fraūce (whiche for
hast, was made of a trūpet banner) because king Lewes was not muche
desirous, nor greatly passed on honor, and seldome had in his Courte,
either officer of Armes or Trompet: whiche varlet was well animated,
and no lesse instructed, how to do his message (whiche was deliuered to
hym in writyng) bothe with a bolde countenaunce, and a sober demeanure.
This coūterfeight Herault, although he was but a verlet in dede,
was bothe wittie and well spoken, and so rode in sad maner, nere to the
Englishe army, and there put on his cote of Armes. The Englishe outskourers
perceiuyng by his cote; that he was an officer of armes, gently
saluted hym, and enquired of hym▪ whether his iorney laie: he sadly answered,
that his message was from the French kyng, to the kyng of Englande.
Then was he conueighed to the tent, where the Lorde Haward,
and the Lorde Stanley, with other wer at dinner, where he was highly
entertaigned, and no lesse welcomed. And after dinner, he was brought
before the kyng, in whose presence, with a bold audacitie, and no fearful
speche, he declared first his credence, because he was an officer of armes
(to whom, credite by the lawe of all nacions, ought to be geuen) and secondarely,
he published the thynges, to hym geuen in charge and commaundement,
saiyng: Right high &amp; mightie prince, right puyssaunt and
noble kyng, if your excellent wisedō did pe
                     •
                  fectly knowe, or your high
knowlege did apparantly perceiue: what inward affeccion, and feruent
desire, the kyng my Master hath alwaies had, to haue a perfecte peace,

a sure vnitie, and a fraternall concord, betwene your noble persone, and
your Realme, and his honorable personage, and his Dominions, you
would (and for truthes sake) should confesse and saie, that neuer Christian
Prince, more thrusted for an amitie, nor yet no louer hath more
sought, to attain to the fauour of his paramor, then he hath soughte, to
haue with you, a perpet
                     •
                  all frendship, amitie, and alliance: to the intent
that the subiectes of bothe the realmes, quietly liuyng vnder twoo princes,
confederate and combined together, in an indissoluble confederaci
                     •
                  
and league, maie mutually embrace eche other in their hartes, maie personally

                     •
                  , and frequent eche others princes territories and dominions,
with their Merchaundises and wares: And finally, the one to
liue with the other, as frende with frende, brother with brother, compaignion
with compaignion, in continall loue, reste, and tranquilitie. And
for his parte he dooth affirme and saie, that sithe he receiued firste the
Croune of his kingdom, and was annoynted with the holy Ampulle, he
neuer attempted, nor yet once imagined, any warre or thyng preiudicial
toward your royall persone, your realme, or your people. If you peraduenture
will saie, that he supported, and maintained the Erle of Warwicke,
against your maiestie, he surely that dooth and will denie: For he
aided hym against the Duke of Burgoyne, whom, he knewe not onely
to be his extreme enemie▪ but also to laie in waite, bothe by sea and land
either to take hym, or vtterly to destroye hym. Whiche Duke of Burgoyne,
onely for his awne cause, hath excited and sollicited your highnes,
to come ouer the troubelous and tempestious seas, to the intent to
cause (yea, in maner to compell) the kyng my Master, to condescende to
suche treatie and appoyntment, as should bee to his onely profite, and
neither to your honor, nor yet to your gain. For if he and suche other, as
daily flatered hym for their peculier profites (as he had many in deede,
that daily sucked at his elbowe) had once obteined the thyng, that thei
breathed for, all your affaires wer put in obliuion, and lefte at large for
them, or their assistence, euen as thei▪ be at this daie. Hath not the Duke
of Burgoyn caused you, first to come into Fraunce: after to set forward
your armi
                     •
                  , and incōclusion, for lake of his promise, to lese the faire season
of the yere, and to lye in the feldes in Winter? Whiche warre, if it
cōtinue, shall neither be profitable to you, nor yet your nobilitie, nor yet
pleasaunte, but painfull to your commonaltie: And finally to bothe the
realmes, and especially to Merchaunt menne, shall bryng bothe misery,
pōuertie, and calamitie. Came the Duke of Burgoyne from Nu
                     •
                  e to
Caleis, onely to visite you? Rode he all that poste haste, onely to blynde
you? Returned he backe into Lorayne again for any cause, but onely to
leue you desolate and to abandon you? Did he or the Constabl
                     •
                  kepe any
one promise with you? Why do you then beleue, &amp; yet still trust them
in whom, you neuer founde faithe nor fidelitie? But if God will it so ordain
that you and my master, maie ioyne in a league and amitie, I dare
bothe saie and swere, that the fine stele neuer cleued faster to the Adamant

stone, then he will sticke and claspe with you, bothe in wealthe and
and woo, in prosperitie and aduersitie: And if it shall please you, to harken
to any reasonable treatie, I beyng a poore man, shall on ieoperdie
of my life (whiche is my chief treasure) vndertake, that this communicacion
shall sorte, and come to suche an effecte, that bothe you and your
nob
                     •
                  litie, shalbe glad and reioyse, and your commons, shalbe contented
and pleased, and thei that haue deceiued you, shalbe bothe abashed and
ashamed: Moste humbly besechyng your highnes, if your pleasure shal
encline this waie, that I maie haue a sure saufe conduite, for one hundred
horses, for suche personages, as the kyng my Master, shall send to
you, with farther intimacion of his mynd and purpose. And if your pleasure
shalbe, to haue the communicaciō in any place, indifferent betwene
bothe tharmies, then I shal warraunt you, a like saueconduite for your
men, as you do sende for oures. When he had accomplished his message
and instruccions, the kyng of Englande and his counsaill, highly commended
his audacitie, his toungue, and his sobernes, geuyng to hym in
reward, a faire gylte cuppe, with a hundred angelles: deliueryng hym a
saueconduite, accordyng to his request and demaunde, with the whiche,
he with spede departed, hauyng with hym an English herault, to bryng
a like sauecōduite, from the Frenche kyng. After bothe the Princes had
maturely consulted on this matter, and that the saueconduites, wer deliuered
on bothe partes: The ambassadors mette, at a village beside Amias,
where were sent by the kyng of Englande, the Lorde Haward, sir
Thomas Sentliger, Doctor Morton, after Chaunceler of Englande.
For the Frenche kyng were sent, the Bastarde of Burbon, Admirall of
Fraunce, the Lorde of sainct Pierre, the Bushop of Enreux called Heverge.
It maie of some be not a litle marueiled at, why the French kyng
thus labored, and sought for peace, and did make so humble, and large
offers as he did: But if thei considred in what case, the realme of Fraūce
stode in, at that tyme hauyng the kyng of Englande, the Duke of Burgoyne,
the Duke of Britayne, their enemies, and all furnished to set vpon
them at one instaunt: Thei maie saie, that the Frenche kyng was
bothe wise and circumspecte, to humble hymself for auantage, or els if
God had not holpen, the realme of Fraunce had been troubled, and tossed
in greate ieoperdie, and daungerous extremitie. The Ambassadors
met at the place appoynted, the Englishe menne demaunded, the whole
realme of Fraunce, or at the least Normandy, and whole Aquitaine, the
allegacions were well proued by the Englishmen, and pollitiquely defended
by the Frenche men, so that with argumentes, without conclusiō
the daie passed, and the Commissioners departed, and made relacion to
their Masters. The Frenche kyng and his counsaill, would in no wise
consent, that the kyng of Englande, should haue any parte, or parcell of
lande, within the realme of Fraunce: but rather fully determined, to put
hymself and his whole realme, in hazard and auenture: so lothe, ye more
aferde, then lothe, he was to haue the Englishemen, to be his next neighbors.

The commissioners at the next metyng, concluded and agreed ce
                     •
                  
                  tain
articles, whiche were by bothe the Princes, accepted and allowed.
It was first couenaūted and a greed, that the French kyng should paie
to the kyng of England without delaie, lxxv.M. Crounes of the sunne,
and yerely .l.M. crounes, to be paied at London, duryng kyng Edwardes
life. And farther it was agreed, y• Charles the Dolphin should mary
the lady Elizabeth, eldest daughter to kyng Edward, &amp; thei twoo to
haue, for the mainteinaunce of their estates, thewhole Duchie of Guyen
or els .l.M. crounes, yerely to bee persolued &amp; paied within the toure of
London, by the space of .ix. yeres: and at the ende of thesaied terme. The
dolphin &amp; his dolphines, peaceably to enioy the whole duchie of Guyen
and of that charge the French kyng, against the kyng of England, then
to be clerely exonerate. And further it was a greed &amp; appointed, that the
ii. princes, bothe for thencreace of loue, &amp; for the continuaunce of amitie
should enteruew eche other, in some place moste expedient, &amp; mete for so
great a purpose: &amp; after their metyng, eche of thē to take a corporal othe

                     〈◊〉
                   presence of thother. This peace to endure .ix. yeres betwene bothe the
realmes, inuiolate to obserue &amp; kepe al thynges, cōcluded, agreed, &amp; appoynted
&amp; on the kyng of Englandes part, wer cōprised as allies in the
league, the dukes of Burgoyn &amp; Britain, if thei would assent. And y• after
y• whole some aforsaid, was to king Edward paied: he should league
in hostage the lorde Haward, &amp; sir Ihō Cheyny Master of his horses, til
he with all his army, was passed ouer the sea. This peace much reioysed
the French kyng▪ to whō, nothing could be either more plesaunt, or more
exceptable, then to haue thenglishmē in short space (how shortly he cared
not) clerely auoyded, &amp; transported out of his realme: immaginyng euer
that by their tariyng, thei would so like the holesome &amp; sweteaire of his
fruitfull country, that a great nomber would be cōtinually sicke &amp; vexed
till thei returned, &amp; sought for their health in thesame delicious climate
again, wherfore, to rid thē with al hastie spede, he borowed y•said some of
lxxv.M. crounes, of euery man that might lend a porcion. King Edward
likewise, although he was of puissance strong inough, to acheue a great
enterprise on his enemies, &amp; farther encoraged, because he was renomed
for y• famous actes▪ by hym before tyme perpetrated, &amp; brought to passe,
in so many battai
                     •
                  es. Desiryng also, rather to haue war, with the Frēch
nacion beyng the old &amp; auncient enemie, to thenglishe name &amp; bloud, yet
when he called to his remembraunce, that the ciuill warre, had so exhansted
and consumed his substaunce and treasure, that if vrgent necessitie
should expostulate, he wer of scant abilitie, to conscribe and set furthe a
newe armie: knowyng his treasorie at home, to bee so voyde and faint,
that it was not able, long to wage his souldiers, thought it bothe reasonable
and profitable, to obeye to necessitie, and to abstein from battail
seyng bothe honorable offers, to hym obleted and agrementes of auantage
to hym 
                     •
                  ocioned. Consideryng chiefly beside all this, that neither
the Duke of Burgoyne, nor the Constable of Fraunce, did, nor would

obserue or performe the promises by them made and sworne. Wherupō
he and the moste of his counsaill, (and specially suche, as loued better
peace then warre, &amp; their wifes soft beddes, better then hard harnesse, or
a stony lodgyng) agreed to this conclusion and concord. But the Duke
of Gloucester and other, to whom the Frenche nacion, was more odious
then a tode, whose swordes thrusted for Frenche bloud detested, abhorred,
and cried out on this peace, saiyng: that all their trauaill, pain, and
expences, were to their shame loste and employed, and nothyng gamed
but a continuall mocke, and daily derision of the Frenche king, &amp; al his
minions, this immaginacion tooke effecte without delaie. For a gentle
manne of the Frenche kynges chamber, after the peace was concluded,
did demaunde of an Englisheman, how many battailles kyng Edward
had vanquished, and he answered, nyne: wherein he hymself, personally
had been. A greate honor saied the Frenche man, but I praie you ꝙ he,
smilyng: How many hath he loste, the Englishman perceiuyng what he
ment, saied: one whiche you by pollicie, and by no strength, haue caused
hym to lese. Well said the Frenche manne, you may ponder in a paire of
balāce, the gain of the nyne gotten battailes, and the rebuke of this one
in this maner loste: for I tell you, that wee haue this saiyng, the force of
Englande hath and doth, surmount the force of Fraunce: but the engenious
witte of the Frenche men, excell the dull braynes of Englishmen.
For in all battailes you haue been the gayners, but in leagues and treaties,
our wittes haue made you losers: so that you may content your selses,
with the losse in treaties, for the spoyle that you gatte, in warres and
battailes. This cōmunicacion was reported to the Frenche kyng, whiche
priuily sent for the Englisheman to supper, and not onely made him
good chere, but also gaue hym a thousande Crounes, to praise the peace
and to helpe to maintain thesame: yet neuerthelesse, he beyng not a litle
moued with these bragges, declared all the communicacion, to the duke
of Gloucester, whiche sware, that he would neuer haue sette foote out of
Englande, if he had not thought, to haue made the Frenchemen once to
assaied the strength and puyssaunce, of the Englishemen: but whatsoeuer
he thought, all thynges wer transmuted, into another kynde, then he
could immagin. The Duke of Burgoyne beyng enformed, that there
was a peace entreatyng, betwene the two kynges: came in no small hast
from Luxenborough, onely accompaignied with sixtene horses, into the
kyng of Englādes lodgyng, wherof, the kyng beyng not a litle abashed
seyng bothe his sodain commyng, and his fierse countenaunce, like one
that would rather bite then whyne, demaunded of hym the cause, of his
so sodain commyng. The Duke sharply answered, to knowe whether he
had, either entered into any communicaciō, or onely had absolutely concluded
a peace, betwene the Frenche kyng and hym. Kyng Edward declared,
how that for sondery, and diuerse greate and vrgent causes, touchyng
aswell the vniuersall publique wealth, of the whole Christianitie
as their awne priuate commoditie, and the quietnes of their realmes, he

and the French kyng, had concluded a peace and amitie, for terme of .ix.
yeres, in the whiche were comprised, as felowes and frendes, bothe he
and the Duke of Britayne, requiryng hym to condiscende, and agree to
thesame. Oh Lorde, Oh sainct George, ꝙ the Duke of Burgoyne, haue
you thus doen 
                     〈◊〉
                   deede: Haue you passed the seas, entered into Fraunce
and without killyng of a poore 
                     •
                  ie, or burnyng of a sely shepe cote, and
haue taken a shame
                     •
                  ull truce: Did your noble auncester, kyng Edward
the thirde, euer make armie into Fraunce (as he made many) in the whiche,
he did not either gain victory in battaill, or profite in conqueryng,
cities, tounes, and countreys. That victorious Prince, as nere kinne to
me, as you to kyng Henry the fifth, I meane whose bloud you haue▪ either
rightefully or wrongfully, God knoweth, 
                     •
                  xstirpate and destroyed,
with a small puyssaunce entered into Fraūce, conquered whole Normā
                  dy,
and not alonely cōquered it, but peaceably kepte it, and neuer would
either commen, or agree to any league, till he had the whole Realme of
Fraunce offered hym, and was thereof made, Regent and heire apparāt
and you without any thyng dooyng, or any honor or profite gainyng,
haue condiscended to a pace, bothe as honorable, and as profitable to
you, as a Pesec
                     •
                  de, and not so wholesome as a Pomegranate: thynke
you that I either moued you, or once entised you, to take this iorney for
my peculier aduauntage, or cōmoditie (whiche of my power am able, to
reuenge mine awne causes, without help of other) but onely to haue you
recouer, your old rightes &amp; possessions, which wer
                     •
                  rō you bothe torciously
&amp; wrongfully with holden. And to thintent that you shall knowe, that
I haue no nede of your aide, I will neither enter into your league, nor
take truce with the Frenche kyng, till you bee passed the sea, and haue
been there three monethes. When Duke Charles had said, he furiously
threwe doune his chayer, and would haue departed. But the kyng hym
staied and saied: Brother Charles, sith you haue spoken at leaser, what
you would, you muste and shall, heare again, what you would not: And
first, as concernyng our entery into Fraunce, no manne liuyng knoweth
that occasion, neither so well, nor hath cause halfe so well, to remembre it
as you: For if you haue not fully, put your greatest thynges, to bee had
in memorie, in your boxe of obliuion, you bee not yet out of mynde, how
the Frenche kyng▪ for all your power, tooke from you the faire 
                     •
                  oune of
Amias, and the strong Pile of. S. Quintynes, with diuerse other 
                     •
                  ounes,
whiche you neither durst, nor yet were able, either to rescowe or defende.
Sith whiche tyme, how he hath plagued you, how he hath taken
from you your frendes, yea, of your priuie chamber, and secrete counsail
(by whom all youre secretes, bee to hym reueled and made open) you
knowe or haue better cause to remembre, and not to forget theim. And
when you determined, to besege the toune of Nuce, you thought youre
self, in a greate doubte, whether you should lease more at home, by your
absence, (the Frenche kyng dremyng, and waityng like a Foxe for his
praie) or els gain more in Germany, by your power and presence, and

to kepe the wolfe from the folde, that is the Frenche kynge, from your
Castels and dominions, was the chiefe and principall cause, why you
so fayre prayed me, so sore laboured and entyced me to passe ouer the
sea, promysynge mountaynes of golde, w
                     •
                  hiche turned into snowe,
and wasted to water, boastynge and crakynge to sende horsemen and
fotemen, and yet shewynge neither lackey nor page. If we hadde made
our enterprice for oure selfe soly, and in our awne quarell thynke you
that we woulde haue expected youre commynge? If the aduenture
hadde bene for to haue recouered our ryghte, imagyn you y• we woulde
haue passed the sea so slenderly, as we did lokynge for your ayde? Nay
nay, you should haue well knowen, if we had entended a conquest, that
we woulde haue so strongly inuaded, &amp; set on the Realme of Fraunce, y•
what with sauor of burnynge of townes, and infeccion of the ayre, corcupted
by the multitude of dead carcases of our slayne enemyes, youre
countreys of Flaunders and Brabant should haue had causes inough
to wonder at, trustyng that, that which we had gotten, we woulde haue
kept aswell as any of our auncetours haue done: but because the very
occasion of the warre was yours, and that you wilfully (I will not saye
cowardly) did not prosecute thesame, the Frenche kynge, whiche neuer
offended me nor my subiectes (except in maynteininge the erle of Warwycke,
for the displeasure that you bare hym agaynste me) offered me,
beyng destitute of all your succour and ayde, bothe honorable and honest
ouertures of peace, which offers I was in maner enforced, by very
reason to enclyne to and to accept, &amp; so haue concluded a truce, whiche
God willyng I will bothe kepe &amp; obserue. God sende you ioy quod the
duke, &amp; sodaynly toke his horse &amp; rode agayn to Luxenborough. After
this day the kyng and the duke, neuer loued, nor neuer saw eche other,
such is the end of vntrustynes &amp; promisbrekyng. If the duke of Burgoyn
were angry, when he hard how this peace was in communicaciō
much more angry was the Constable of Fraunce, fearynge lest, that by
that conclusion he might be reputed of the French kyng v
                     •
                  trew, as 
                     •
                  e
had wel deserued it. Wherfore he sent hys confessor to kynge Edward,
with letters of credēce, requyryng hym hartely littell to regard y• Frēch
kynges woordes, and lesse to trust to his promise, affermynge that the
Frenche kynge woulde no lenger kepe promise, then kynge Edwarde
were on that syde of the sea: and rather then he shoulde agre with the
Frenche kyng, for a small summe of money, he offered to lende hym .l.
thousand crounes, with many other fayre profers. The kynge of Englande
made answere that the truce was concluded, and that he woulde
nothing chaunge, concernyng the matter, &amp; that if he had kept promyse
with hym, he would not haue made that apoyntement nor agrement.
               Then was the Constable in maner on all sydes in dispayre, but yet he
wrote to the French kyng by his messengers, besechyng him to geue no
credite or belefe, to any 
                     •
                  ale tolde or fayned agaynste him, without hearyng
his answere, affirmynge that the kynge had always knowen hys

treuth and fidelitie, towarde the croune of Fraunce, and so shoulde he
still fynde hym till his dyeng day, promising &amp; warranting him, if that
it should stand with his pleasure, that he woulde so cōpasse the duke of
Burgoyn, that they two should vtterly destroy the kyng of Englande
and his army or they returned.
               The counsaylers of the French kyng made answere, that their Master
and the kyng of England were ioyned and confedered in a sure amitie,
wherfore they would in no wise know nor condiscēd to any thing
that might be either preiudiciall, or once sounde to the detriment of the
Englishmen: But they sayd, that the kyng their master much trusted y•
Constable, and that for hys sake he would talke with them in his priuy
chaumber. The French kyng, before their entry into his chamber, caused
the lord of Countay seruaunt to the duke of Burgoyn, accōpanied
with the lord of Argenton, one of his priuie counsayll, to stande secretly
behynd a selyng or a hangyng in his chamber, and he him selfe sat in a
chayre, directly before that place, so that what soeuer were purposed to
hym, they standing behynd the clothe, might 
                     •
                  asely se, &amp; facile heare the
same. Lewes de creuell and his felow entered into the kynges chamber
of nothinge thinkinge lesse then of the sprytes enclosed: they declared
what payne their master had taken for the French kynges sake, to send
moue and entyce the duke of Burgoyn to leaue, and clerely to forsake y•
kyng of England, which duke they founde in suche a rage and fury agaynst
the Englishmen, that at their request, he was not onely vtterly
determined, to forsake and refuse their amitie, but also would sende out
aduenturers and Lanceknightes, to robbe &amp; spoyle them in their retornyng.
And in spekyng these wordes (thinking surely much to please the
kyng) the sayd Lewes conterfeyted the fashion and gesture of the duke
of Burgoyn▪ &amp; began to stāpe with his fote on the groūd, and bete with
hys fyste on the table, sweryng by sainct George that the kyng of Englande
was not extracted of no noble house, but was a yomans sonne, &amp;
that when he was not worth one halfpeny, he was restored to his kyngdome,
and made kyng onely by his ayde, reprouyng and reuilyng hym
with suche yll wordes, and so shamful termes, that al the herers abhorred
it. The Frēch kyng fayning that he was thycke of hearyng, caused
him to reiterate his saiyng agayn, which so cōterfeited the very gesture
of the dukes angry contenaunce &amp; roryng voyce, that no man hathe
sene a better coūterfaytor or player in any Comedie or Tragedie. The
lord or Cōtay was sore displeased to se hys master made a iestingstocke
but he kepte all these thinges secret, tyll his retorne to his master.
               When the pagiaunt was played, the kyng bad the messengers of y• Cō
                  stable,
to haue him cōmended to his brother their master, and to declare
to him that as newes rose and grew, he would therof aduertise hym, &amp;
so gaue them licence to depart to their master, who thoughte him selfe
now to be in great suertye of hys estate, when in dede he was neuer so
nere his falle and perdicion: Estemyng the duke of Burgoyn to be his

assured frende, whiche hated hym more then a Panym, or a Turke, accomptyng
also the French kyng to haue no yll suspicion in hym, whiche
neither trusted nor yet beleued any worde, writyng or message that was
either writen or sent from him: Such ende hath all dissimulacion, suche
frute springeth of double dealyng &amp; crafty cōueyeng: for if either y• Cō

had bene faithfull to the kyng his master, as of bounden duetye &amp;
allegeaunce he ought to be, or els had kept his promes, made to y• king
of England &amp; duke of Burgoyn, and not dalied &amp; dissimuled with thē,
he had surely in his extremitie bene ayded, succored &amp; cōforted of one of
these thre at the lest, where now he was of al thre forsakē, &amp; yet not forsaken,
but sought for, loked for, &amp; watched for, not for his profit or promocion,
but for hys vndoyng and destrucciō: Now let vs leaue of the Cō
                  stable,
and returne to the cōclusion of the peace. When all thinges were
apoynted, wryten &amp; established, the peace was proclaymed in bothe the
campes, and the kyng of England, the soner to consumate the amit
                     •
                  e by
othe as it was agreed, came within halfe a leage of Amyas, where the
French kyng was, which to thentent to obteyne the more fauor of Thē
                  glishmen,
sent into their army a .C. Cartes, loden with wyne, y• best that
might be gotten. And farther, because the Englishmen resorted to the
town of Amyas, bothe for their pastime &amp; busines, he ordeined at y• very
entri
                     •
                   of the gate of the town two great &amp; long tables, to be set on euery
syde of the streat, where the Englishmen should passe, &amp; euery table was
abundantly furnished with all sortes of delicate viand, &amp; especially of
such as would prouoke an appetide to drynke, there lacked no wyne of
no sorte, seruitours were redy to serue and minister al thinges necessary.
And farther to accompany &amp; familierly to entertayne the English naciō
at euery table were apoynted .v. or .vj. gentelmen, of the beste compaignions
of the whole coūtray, not onely to se them serued without lacking
but also to drynke and make good chere, and kepe company with them,
and euer as they entered into the towne, they were taken by the brydels
and in maner 
                     •
                  nforced to drynke, wheresoeuer they came they payed no
money, but were set scot free, which chere lasted .iii. or .iiii. dayes, to the
French kynges cost, and in conclusion to his no small vnquietinge. For
one day there entered into the towne of Amyas .ix.M. Englishmen, wel
armed, so that no Frēchman durst once forbid them to entre, their occasion
of enteryng into the toune was onely to refreshe them, and to bye
thinges necessary for their businesses and affayres. When the Frenche
kyng was therof enformed, he was somwhat vexed &amp; more amased, fearyng
either the losse of his toune, or hurt of his people: He sent to Thenglish
capitaynes, requiring them to withdraw their souldiers to theyr
Campe, the capitaynes performed the kynges desyre, as much as in thē
lay, but if they sent out .xx, ten came backe agayne, and brought more cō
                  pany
with them. The French kyng sent Monsier de Guye, Marshall
of Fraūce, &amp; other into the toune to se the Englishmēs behaueour, they
founde some drinkyng, some singing, &amp; some slepyng, so that they might

perceyue, that they ment neither disceat nor vntreuth: yet the Frenche
kyng, which of his nature was very suspicious, &amp; especially toward the
Englishmen, came to the gate of Amyas, strongly accōpaignied, &amp; caused
.iij.C.men of armes to be kept secretly in their capitaynes houses, &amp;
other cōpaigny he set on the portall, where y• Englishmē entered, a smal
number God wot, to haue resisted the great company of Englishmen if
they had either entēded any thing toward y• French kyng or his toune.
The kyng of Englād was priuilie enformed of y• Frēch kinges, doubtfull
imaginacion, &amp; vntrew suspiciō, wherfore he sent word to him that
he should make a Proclamacion, that no Englishmā should entre into
the toune vpon a peyne. The Frēch kyng made answere, that it neither
stode with his honor, nor yet with any princely humanitie, y• he shoulde
forbid his frendes (as he called them) to take their pleasure in his toune
but if it might please the kyng of Englād, to apoint certain of the yomē
of hys Croune, to stand at the gate, &amp; to apoynt, not onely who shoulde
enter, but also the number of theim, he thoughte that this moderacion
should be both suerty &amp; pleasure to both the parties. Which request the
kyng of England with quicke spede, caused to be performed to y• great
quietnes of the French kyng &amp; his coūsaill, casting farther periles then
reason then required. You, haue still in your remēbrāce, how an article
of the treaty was, that the two Princes shoulde enteruiew, &amp; mete in a
place by both parties to be appoynted. The kyng of England appoynted
the lord Haward, &amp; syr Thomas Sentliger, &amp; a Herault: for y• Frēch
kyng were assigned the lord Bonchace, &amp; the lord of Argentō. Whē thei
had vewed the Ryuer, they agreed the most conuenient &amp; surest place to
be at Pycquegnye, on the water of Some .iii. leagues fro Amyas. The
toune standeth lowe, and the Ryuer passeth thorough. On that syde y•
the French kyng should come, the coūtrey fayre &amp; open, and so likewise
the other parte was very pleasaunt: but towarde the Ryuer, ther was a
Cawsey of .ii. arow shout in lēgth, which was enuyroned with marshes
surely it was a daungerous passage to conueye a Prince in a straunge
Realme, by such a strayte, if the Frenche men had ment any fraude, but
verely the kyng of England had so great trust &amp; confidēce in the honor
&amp; promise of the French kyng &amp; his nobilitie, that he woulde vpon their
assurance aduentured farther then this, if his will might haue ben performed.
Then it was cōcluded by these .iiii. commissioners, that a large
bridge should be made ouer the Ryuer of Some, in y• middel of which
bridge was made a great strōg grate of tymber▪ like to the grate where
the Lyons be kept▪ the holes of which grate did extende into no longer
quantitie, then that a man myght easely put thorough his arme, which
bridge was made &amp; couered with bordes, onely to kepe of the wether, so
that vnder the couerture, there might stand .xii. persons on euery sude of
the grate which extended from the one syde of the bridge, euen directly
to the other so y• there was no way for one Prince to come to the other
(as was in the grate, where Ihon duke of Burgoyn was slayn) &amp; ouer

the Ryuer was onely one fery bote. When the bridge &amp; all other thynges
necessary were ended &amp; performed for so great a purpose, and well &amp;
diligently vewed on both the sydes, there were appointed .xii. noble personages,
to be attendant on euery Prince to the barres, &amp; .iiii. Englishmen
were assigned to stand with the Frēch men on the bridge, to se their
doyng and behauoure, &amp; likewyse .iiii. Frenchmē were limitted to y• Englishmen
for that same cause and policie. At the day appoyn
                     •
                  ted, which
was the .xxxi. day of August, in the yere of Christes blessed incarnacion
M.cccc.lxxv. eche kynge approched the Ryuer syde with his army, so y•
eche army might se other. The Frenchmen say &amp; write, that the army of
the Englishmen, was greater and muche fayrer then their battayll, but
they excuse it (in this cace as they do in all other) saiyng that the fourth
parte of their army was lacking, you may alow their excuse if it please
you. When the token of meting by the shot of the Artelerie was knowen,
the French kyng with .xii. noble men entered the bridge, &amp; came to
the closure, with whome was Ihon duke of Burbon, and the Cardinall
hys brother, a prelate, more mete for a ladyes carpet, then for an Ecclesiasticall
pulpet &amp; .x. other, emongest whome the lorde of Argenton was
in like disguised apparell, as the Frēch kyng ware, for so was his pleasure
that day to haue hym adourned. The kynge of Englande came all
alonge the causey that I haue spoken of well accōpaignied, that he semed
well to be a kyng, &amp; with him was hys brother the duke of Clarēce
the erle of Northumberland, the bishop of Elye hys Chanceler, the lord
Hastynges his Chamberlayn, &amp; .viij. other lordes. Kyng Edward, &amp; .iiii
other were appareled in clothe of golde frised, hauynge on hys bonet of
of blacke weluet a floure delyce of golde, set with very ryche and orient
stones, he was a goodly fayre &amp; a beautefull Prince, beginninge a littel
to growe in flesh, and when he approched nere the grate, he toke of hys
cappe, and made a low and solempne obeysance: the French kyng made
to hym an humble reuerence, but after hys fashion somwhat homely.
               Kyng Lewes embrased kyng Edward thorough the barriers saiynge:
Cosyn you be right hartely welcome into these parties, assuringe you y•
there is no man in the world y• I haue more desyred to se &amp; speke wyth,
thē with you, &amp; now lauded be almighty God, we be here mette together
for a good &amp; Godly purpose, whereof I doubte not, but y• we shal haue
cause to reioyce. The kyng of England hym thanked and answered to
hys wordes so soberly, so grauelye, and so princely, that the Frenchmē
their at not a littell mused.
               The Chanceler of England made there a solempne oracion, in laude
&amp; prayse of peace, concluding on a prophe
                     •
                  ie, y• sayd that at Pycquegny
should be concluded a peace, bothe honorable &amp; profitable to the Realmes
of Englād &amp; Fraūce. Then the Chāceler opened the letters of both
their agremētes to the treatie, demādyng of thē if they there with were
contented, they answered ye, then eche Prince layed his right hand on y•
Missal, &amp; his left hand on the holy Crosse, &amp; toke there a solēpne othe, to

obserue and kepe the treatie of the truce for .ix. yeres cōcluded betwene
them, with all their confederates and alies cōprised, mencioned and specefied
in thesame, and farther to accōplishe the mariage of their chylderne,
with all thinges theron depending, according as it was agreed &amp;
concluded betwene their Ambassadors, whē the othe was takē &amp; sworne,
the French kyng sayd merily to kyng Edward, brother, if you will take
peyn to come to Parys, you shall be feasted and entertayned with Ladies,
&amp; I shall apoynt you the Cardinal of Burbon for your confessor,
which shall gladly assoyle you of suche synnes, if any be committed.
               The kyng of England toke these wordes pleasauntly and thankefully,
for he was enformed that the Cardinall was a good compaignion, &amp; a
Chaplayne mete for such a dalyeng pastyme. When thys communicacion
was merily ended, the French kyng, entendynge to shew hym selfe
lyke a Master emonngest hys seruauntes, made all hys compaigny to
draw backe from hym, meanyng to comon wyth the kyng of England
secretly, the Englishmen with drew them without any commaundemēt,
then the two kynges commoned alone secretly, I thynke not to the profite
of the Constable of Fraunce. The Frenche kyng demaunded of
of kyng Edward, whether the duke of Burgoyn would accept the trē
                  ce,
Kynge Edwarde answered that he woulde once agayne make an offer,
and then vpon the refusall, he would referre and report the treuth to
them bothe. Then kyng Lewes began to speke of the duke of Britayn,
whome he would fayne haue excepted out of the leage. To whom the
kyng of England answered: Brother I requyre you to moue no warre
to the duke of Britayne, for on my fidelitie, in the tyme of my nede and
aduersitie, I neuer founde a more frendlye sure and stedfast louer then
he.
               Then kyng Lewes called his cōpaignye agayne, &amp; with most lowly &amp;
amiable commendacions, toke his leue of the kyng of Englād, speking
certayn frendly wordes to euery Englishmā. Kyng Edward doyng lykewise
to the Frēchmē, then both at one tyme departed frō the barriers
&amp; mounted on horsebacke, and departed the French kyng to Amyas, &amp;
kyng Edward to hys army, to whome was sent out of the French kynges
house all thynges necessarie for a Prince, in so much y• neither Torches
nor Torchettes lacked vnsent. When the French king was departed
from Picquegny, he called to hym the lord of Argentō sayeng, by y•
peace of God, the kyyg of England is an amorous &amp; a fayre prince, he
at the fyrst becke woulde gladly se Parys, where he mighte fortune to
fynde such pleasaunt or talkatyue Dames, which with fayre woordes,
and pleasaunt pastymes myght so allure hym to theyr fantasies, that
it myght brede an occasion in hym to come ouer the sea agayne, whiche
I woulde not gladly se, for hys progenitors haue ben to longe and too
often bothe in Parys and Normandye (on thys syde the sea) loue neither
hys syght nor hys cōpaginye, but when he is at home, I loue hym
as my brother, and take hym as my frende.
               
                  
The Frenche kyng after this departyng, sore desirous to make warre
on the Duke of Britayne, whiche he could not do, except he wer lift out
of the treatie, wherfore he sent the lorde of Bouchage, and the lord of. S.
Pierre, to the kyng of Englande, entreatyng hym by all waies and mocions
possible, to leaue the duke of Britayn for his alie, and not to haue
hym comprehended in the league: the kyng of Englande hearyng thē so
seriously and so feruently, speake against the Duke of Britayn, with an
earnest cou
                     •
                  tenaunce answered, saiyng: My Lordes I assure you, if I
wer peaceably at home in my realme, yet for the defence of the Duke of
Britayn and his countrey, I would passe the seas again, against all thē
that either would do him iniurie, or make warre vpon hym, the Frenche
Lordes nothyng farther saiyng, muche marueiled why the kyng of Englande,
so surely claue to the Duke of Britaynes partie. But thei knew
not (or els at the least remembred not) that Henry Erle of Richemonde,
was within the power and dominion, of the Duke of Britayne, whom
kyng Edwardes phanteasie euer gaue hym, would make once a title to
the Croune of Englande, as next heire to the house of Lancastre: For he
knewe well, that if the Duke of Britayne, would transporte hym into
England, where he had bothe kyns
                     •
                  olke and frendes, with neuer so smal
an aide (yea, although it wer but a shadowe of an army) then wer he enforced,
newly to begin again a conquest, as though he had neuer wonne
the Croune, nor obteigned the possession of the Realme, whiche was the
verie cause, why he stacke so sore, on the Duke of Britaynes part. Thesame
night the lordes returned to Amias, and reported to their Master
kyng Edwardes answere, whiche therwith, was not the best pleased, but
pleasure or displeasure, there was no remedy, but to dissimule the matter.
This same night also, there came the lorde Haward, and twoo other
of the kyng of Englādes counsaill, whiche had been coadiutors toward
the peace, to the Frenche kyng to supper. The lorde Haward said to the
Frenche kyng, secretly in his eare, that if it stoode with his pleasure▪ he
could perswade the kyng of Englande, to come to Amias, yea, p
                     •
                  tauenture
as farre as Paris, familierly and frendly, to solate hymself with
hym, as his trustie frende and faithfull brother. The Frenche kyng, to
whom this mocion was nothyng pleasaunt, callyng for water, washed
and rose without any answere makyng: but he saied to one of his counsaill,
that he imagined in his awne conceipt, that this request would bee
made: the Englishe menne began again, to common of that matter, the
Frenche men pollitiquely brake their communicacion, saiyng: that the
kyng with all celeritie, must marche forward, against the duke of Burgoyn.
Although this mocion semed, onely for to encrease loue, and continuall
amitie betwene the Princes, yet the Frenchmen hauyng, in their
perfecte remembraunce, the innumerable damages and huttes, whiche
thei of late daies, had susteined by the Englishe nacion: whereby, continual
hatred encreased, against them in Fraunce, thought by pollicy and
wisedom, with faire woordes, and frendly countinaunce, to put by this

request, and to mocion them rather, to departe homeward, then to pricke
them forward to Paris, where peraduenture, thei might so bee entertained
at this tyme, that thei would at another come thether, bothe vndesired
and vnwelcomed. This peace was said to be made, onely by the holy
ghoste, because that on the daie of metyng, a white Doue satte on the
very toppe, of the kyng of Englandes tent: whether she sat there to drie
her, or came 
                     •
                  hether as a token, geuen by God, I referre it to your iudgemente.
At this treatie and metyng, was not the Duke of Gloucester,
nor other lordes, whiche were not content with this truce, but the Duke
came afterwarde to Amias, with diuerse other Lordes of Englande, to
the Frenche kyng, whiche, bothe highly feasted them, and also presented
them with plate and horses, well garnished. Kyng Lewes consideryng,
what gai

Frenchmen write, a hundered markes of siluer, made in plate, wherof euery

Beside this, he gaue hym yerely, twoo thousande Crounes penciō,

his house, geuyng hym in charge, to receiue of hym an acquitaunce, for
the receipt of thesame pencion, to thintent that it should appere, in tyme
to come, that the Chauncellor, Chamberlain, Admirall, Masters of the

been in fee and pencionaries, of the Frenche kyng, whose yerely acquitaunces
(the lorde Hastynges onely except) remain of recorde to bee shewed,
in the Chamber of accomptes, in the palaice of Paris. Whē Piers
Cleret had paied the pencion, to the lorde Hastynges, he gently demaū
                  ded
of hym an acquitaunce, for his discharge, whiche request when he

but reason, answered him: sir this gift cōmeth onely, of the liberall pleasure
of the kyng his Master, and not of my request: if it be his determinate
will, that I shall haue it, then putte you it into my sleue, and if not,

Chamberlain of Englande, hath been pencionary, with the Frenche
kyng, and shewe his acquitaunce, in the Chamber of accomptes, to his
dishonor. Piers lefte his money behynd, and made relacion of all thynges
to his Master, whiche, although that he had not his will, yet he
muche more praised the wisedom, and pollicie of the Lorde Hastynges,
then of the other pencionaries, commaundyng hym yerely to bee paied,
without any discharge demaundyng.
               When the kyng of Englande, had rec
                     •
                  iued his tribute, and his nobilitie
their rewardes, of the Frenche kyng: he trussed vp his tentes, and
laded all his bagage, and departed toward Caleis, but or he came there,
he rememberyng the craftie dissimulacion, and the vntrue dealyng, of
Lewes Erle of. S. Pole, high Constable of Fraunce, entendyng to declare
hym, to the French kyng, in his verie true likenes and portarture:
sent vnto hym twoo letters of c
                     •
                  edence, written by thesaied Constable,
with the true report, of all suche woordes and messages, as had been to
hym sente, and declared by thesaied Constable and his Ambassadours,
whiche letters, the Frenche kyng gladly receiued, and thankfully accepted▪
as the chief instrument, to bryng the Constable to his death: which
he escaped no long season after, suche is the ende of dissimulers.
               When kyng Edward was come to Caleis, and had set al thynges in
an ordre, he toke shippe, and sailed with a prosperous wynde, into Englande,
and was receiued by the Maior of London, and the Magistrates
clad in scarlet, and .v.C. cōmoners, appareled in Murrey, the .xxviii
daie of Septembre, in the .xiiii. yere of his reigne, vpon Blacke Heathe,
and so conueighed with greate triumph, through the citie of Westminster,

where after his long labor, he reposed hymself a while: euery daie
almoste, talkyng with the Quene his wife, of the mariage of his daughter,
whom, he caused to be called Dolphenesse: thynkyng nothyng surer,
then that mariage to take effecte, accordyng to the treatie. The hope of
whiche mariage, caused hym to dissimule, and do thynges, whiche afterward
chaunsed, greatly to the Frenche kynges profite, &amp; smally to his.
               When kyng Edwarde was arriued in Englande, the Frenche Kyng
thynkyng by no meane possible, to haue his will on the Constable, but
onely by the Duke of Burgoyne, determined to conclude a truce, for .ix.
yeres, vpon couenaunt, euery man to haue his awne: but the Ambassadours,
would not haue the truce proclaimed, thynkyng thereby, to saue
the Duke from periurie, whiche had sworne, neuer to conclude a peace,
till the kyng of Englande had been three monethes in his realme, after
his returne from Caleis. The kyng of Englande, was of all these dooynges▪
asserteined by his frendes: wherefore, in all hast he sent, sir Thomas
Moungomerie, a wise and a sage knight, to the Frenche kyng, beyng
then at Uernyns, concludyng with the duke of Burgoyns Ambassadors,
requiryng hym, to take none other truce, with Duke Charles,
then that, whiche was by theim concluded, desiryng hym farther, in no
wise to departe with sainct Quintines to the duke: Offeryng that if he
would, any longer continue the warre, against thesaied Duke, that he
would for his pleasure, and the dukes displeasure, passe the seas again,
the nexte Sommer: so that the Frenche kyng, should paie to hym fiftie
thousand crounes, for the losse whiche he should sustein, in his Custome
by reason that the wolles at Caleis, because of the warre, could haue no
vent, nor be vttred, and also paie halfe the charges, and halfe the wages
of his souldiers, and men of warre.
               The Frenche kyng, moste hartely thanked, the kyng of Englande, of
his kynde offre, and faithfull frendshippe, excusyng hym, that the peace
was al ready assented to: how be it, it was the verie same peace, that was
betwene theim concluded, sauyng onely, that the duke would bee, a contractor
in the league, and not comprehēded in thesame, as another princes
alie. This matter was thus answered, and faintly excused, and with
thesame, sir Thomas Mountgomerie dispatched, which was with plate
conueniently rewarded: and with hym returned, the lorde Haward, and
sir Ihon Cheiney, whiche wer hostages with the Frenche kyng, til kyng
Edwarde were returned into Englande. The Frenche kyng marueiled
not a litle, at kyng Edwardes offres, and thought it perilous to cause
the Englishemenne to passe the sea again, and to ioyne with the Frenche
menne, whom thei neuer loued: coniecturyng farther, that the Englishe
menne and the Burgonyons, would sone agre, by reason of their old acquaintaunce
and familiaritie, and by chaunce, bothe become enemies to
the Frenche men: wherefore, in auoydyng of all ambiguites, he determined
to conclude the truce.
            
            
               The .xv. yere.
               
                  
                  WHen Kyng Edwarde had after this maner established,The .xv. yer. as
well his affaires of outwarde warres, as his priuate and
perticuler busines at home, notwithstandyng, that he beyng
the moste valiaunt, and fortunate victor, of suche, and
so many terrible and bloudy battailes, might thynke to
leade his life, in perfect quietnes, and sure sauetie: Yet consideryng, that
Henry the young erle of Richemond, one of the ofsprynges, of the bloud
of kyng Henry the sixte, was yet liuyng and in good health, he iudged
hymself, to bee farre from his purpose, and that that onely thyng▪ did so
vexe and trouble his ioye and felicitie, that he thought hymself, neuer to
bee in a sure estate, voyde of trouble or feare. Wherfore, he determined
yet once again, to sollicite and moue, Fraūces Duke of Britayne, either
for giftes, promises or praiers, to deliuer the Erle into his handes, whō
he supposed (after the faccion and bande, of kyng Henries parte, by hym
extincted, and clerely defeated) to bryng to his lure, and to rule at his
awne mynde and pleasure. Wherfore, he sent Doctor Stillyngton, and
twoo other, his Ambassadors, well laden with no small some of golde,
with all hast to the Duke of Britayn: And to the intent that their desire
should appere more honest, in the open face of the world, he willed them
to declare to the Duke, that their request, to haue the Erle deliuered to
them, was onely for this purpose, to ioyne with him aliance by mariage
and so to extirpate and plucke vp, all the dregees and leuynges of the
aduerse part, and contrary faccion. Whiche enterprise (whatsoeuer thei
saied) was not onely by affinitie, but by the onely death, of the innocent
erle Henry, to be acheued and brought to passe. The Duke gently hard
the Orators, and firste he began to deny, &amp; after to excuse, why he might
nor ought not agree to their request but inconclusion, what with praiers
requiryng, and monnyes, sollicityng▪ the Duke beyng weried and ouercome,
deliuered the erle to the Ambassadors, whom, in his letters he
highly commended, to kyng Edwarde, not thynkyng that he deliuered,
the shepe to the wolfe, but the sonne to the father, beleuyng surely without
scruple or doubt, that kyng Edward would geue in mariage to him
lady Elizabeth his eldest daughter, whom in deede he maried▪ after her
fathers death, as you herafter shall heare. Whē thambassadors had the
praie, that thei so muche desired, thei departed to the toune of. S. Malo,
standyng on the sea side, where, thei rekened to haue taken shippyng,
and so to haue sailed into Englande. The erle of Richemond knowyng,
that he was goyng toward his death, for very pensiuenes, and inwarde
thought, fell into a feruent &amp; a sore agewe. In this very season, one Ihō
Cheulet, so estemed emong the Princes of Britayne, as fewe were in all
the countrey, and in muche credite, and wel accepted with the duke, was
when these thynges were thus concluded, for his solace in the countrey,
but beyng thereof certified, beyng chafed with the abhominacion of the
fact: resorted to the Courte, and familierly came to the Dukes presence,
and there stode so sadly, and so paly, without any worde speakyng, that

the Duke was muche abashed, and sodainly marueiled, at his sad and
frownyng coūtenaunce, &amp; demaunded of him what should 
                     •
                  ignifie, that
dumpishenes of mynde, and inward sighyng, the whiche by his countenaunce,

is at the very brynke to perishe, whom, if you permitte once to set but
one foote, out of your power and dominion, there is no mortall creature
able hereafter, to deliuer hym from death. The duke beyng moued, with
the perswasions of Ihon Cheynet▪ whiche either litle beleued, or smally
suspected kyng Edward, to desire the erle for any 
                     •
                  raude or deceipte, or
els seduced by blynde auarice and loue of money▪ more then honestie, fidelitie,
or wisedom would require, did not consider, what he vnaduisedly
did, or what he aduisedly, should haue doen. Wh
                     •
                  rfore, with all diligence▪
he sent furthe Peter Landoyse, his chief Threasorer, commaundyng
hym to intercept and staie, the Erle of Richemond, in all hast possible.
Peter not sluggyng, nor dreamyng his busines: came to the Englishe
Ambassadors to. S. Malos, there abidyng the wynde. And firste
he inuented a cause of his commyng, and kepte with theim a long communicacion,
to pertracte the tyme, till his men in the meane season, had
conu

                  rle (almoste halfe ded) into a sure Sanctuary, within the
toune, whiche in nowise might bee violated: where he beyng deliuered,

from the continual feare of dredful death, recouered hys health, and in
good plight was brought to the duke.
               Here a man may euidently perceyue the olde Greke prouerbe to bee
very trew, which is that a man, to a man shall sometyme be as a God,
for the yong erle Henry without desert deliuered to his death, sodaynly
by the labor of Ihon Cheulet, and the fauor of the good Prince, was
preserued, saued and deliuered. God graunt that such examplesmay be
a doctrine and 
                     •
                  yrror to such as be rulers aboue other, lackyng counsaylers
to monish &amp; warne them of their duetie and office. That thei remembryng
thys good acte, may learne to take into the counsayl and 
                     •
                  amilie,
such as will well and truly admonishe and warne them, and they
likewise with good mynde and glad entent to be folowers of thesame.
               The English oratours complayned and murmured that they were
both spoyled of their money &amp; marchandise, requyring Peter Landoyse
that they in no wise should returne, so deluded without pray or penney.
The Treasorer effectuously promised them, that the Erle either should
be surely kept in the Sentuary, into the which he escaped (by their negligence
as he layed to their charge) or els should be agayn in the dukes
house put in prison, so that they shoulde not nede no more to feare hym
then hys shadow. And so the kyng of England for hys money, purchased
the keping of his enemye by the space of .iii. dayes, and no more.
               Kyng Edward in the meane season, sore belongyng to know what effect
hys Ambassade toke with the duke of Britayne, and therefore was
euery houre trobled and vnquieted with harkenyng &amp; lokynge, was at
the last certefied from thence, howe the erle of Rychemond was deliuered,
and at a poynt to be brought home to hym as a prisoner in captiuitie:
but that he escaped first, he lamented hys purpose, not to haue more
prosperously succeded, but after beyng somwhat molified and apeased,
when he hard that he should be sauelykept in prison, determined clerely
hereafter to banishe that care out of hys mynd and fantasye, and to employe
all hys whole study and diligence for the kepynge of hys house,
after a more beutyfull fashion and liberall proporcion, then before was
accustomed. And when he had sufficiently stored hys cheste with treasure,
remembryng hys honor, lest, he peraduenture should be noted with
the spot of Nygardshyp, he shewed hym selfe lyke a liberall and beneficiall
Prince to hys commons, and lyke a good and a profitable kynge
to the cōmon wealth, &amp; the poore people of hys Realme and dominion.

rest, and hys Realme to a continual amitie, and a perpetual
peace, lykewyse at thesame tyme Charles duke
of Burgoyn, whose wit neuer loued peace, nor yet
was wery or abhorred troble, whose intollerable paynes
in warres were to hym pleasure, and especially

where he thought any new seignorie to obteine, or els to be reuenged of
auncient enemyes, for olde greues and displeasures to him done. So y•
desyre of rule mixt with hatred, and malice cōbined with auarice, kyndeled▪
prouoked and excited so hys courage thys yere (whose bragging
audacitie had more nede of a brydell to be refrayned, then of a spurre to
be pricked forward) that he partly to be reuenged of y• duke of Lorayne
and y• Swytchers, and partly for y• couetous desyre that he had to certayn
lādes, lyeng betwene hys lowe countreys of Brabant &amp; Flaūders
and hys Duchie of haut Burgoyn, assembled a great army &amp; a mighty
puyssance, and beseged a towne called Granson in Lorayn, which when
he had receyued, without mercy, lyke a tyrant he caused all the Inhabitātes
cruelly to be put to death, wherof heryng the Switchers māfully
encoūtered with hym, and disconfited hys whole armye, where the duke
lost bothe honor, prayse, and such abundaunce of ryches, that few Princes
in hys tyme were able to shew such Iuels, and so many, &amp; of suche
high price and value. And after not cōtent with these chaūces, but euer
in hope of reuēging he fought with the Switchers agayne at Morrat,
wherof .xviii.M. good mē of warre, he lost .x.M. besyde them that were
wounded and hurt: yet this fierce &amp; couragious Capitayne, more coragious
then circūspect, gathered agayn a new army, and contrary to the
myndes of hys whole counsaill, in the depe of Wynter, beseged y• toune
of Nancy, belongyng to the duke of Lorayn, where he was encoūtered
with the sayd duke and the Switchers, and there by thē agayne ouercome,
disconfited, and slayne.
               Thus in one yere he lost .iii. great battayles, the fyrste at Grantson,
where he lost honor, and all hys ryches: The second at Morrat, where
he lost honor, &amp; almost all hys men: The thyrd at Nancy, where he loste
lyfe, honor, ryches, men, and all worldely felicitie, on the Uigile of the
Epiphany, in the yere of our lord, after some writers .M.cccc.lxxvi. and
after other .M.cccc.lxxvij.
               Thys ende had the valiant hart, and stout courage of duke Charles
of Burgoyn, who in hys tyme could neuer agre with peace and cōcord,
tyll death more puyssant then lyfe maye resiste, broughte hys bodye to
quietnes and perpetual tranquilite, which body is entered in y• Church
of sainct George in Nancy, leuyng behynd him one sole doughter, lawfully
begotten to be his heyre, which afterward was maryed to Maximiliaen
Arch
                     •
                  duke of Austrice.
               At this battayl were taken Anthony and Bauldwyn, bastarde bretherne
to duke Charles, whome the French kyng bought of the duke of
Lorayne, to the entent that they shoulde not withstande hys pretensed
purpose in Flaunders. Yf any man were sory of the duke of Burgoyns
death you may be sure that he was not so inwardly sory, as the Frenche
kyng was in hart ioyous and glad: For now hauyng peace with Englande,
he knew no creature that was able to matche with hym in earnest
or in game, &amp; because he would lese no tyme, he vnder couler that womē
                  
be not able to enioy any thyng, that is or hath ben, aperteynynge to the
Croune of Fraunce, toke of the yong Damosel of Burgoyn the tounes
of Moundedier, Perone, Abbeuyle, Monstreul Roy, and all the tounes
on the ryuer of Some: Besyde thys, he with no great payne obteyned
Hesdyng, Arras, and the toune of Bulleyn, with the countye of Bullonoys,
whiche kynge Charles hys father had before engaged, and empledged
to duke Philip of Burgoyn, as before is mencioned. But thys
wyly and wytty kyng Lewes, comyng to the toune of Bulleyn, perceyued
that if it were fortefied with a garrison, it should not onely be an yl
neyghbor to the tounes of Caleys and Guysnes, but also a port necessa
                  
                     •
                  ie
and conuenient for all hys subiectes, when they should be, either by
enemies assayled, or by stormy tempestious wether driuē on the narrow
seas, wherfore to cast a sure Ancker, knowynge the lord Bartrame de la
Toure, erle of Auluerie, to be the very trew and vndubytate heyre of y•
sayd toune and countie: He fyrst obteyned of him his righte and title in
thesame, rewarding him with a greater summe, &amp; a more yerely value of
reuenewes, in the countye of Forest, and other places. And after to the
entent to haue a port euer open vpō Englād, he annexed thesame toune
of Bulleyne, and the countie of Bullonoys, with the partes adiacent, to
the croune and regalitie of Fraunce. And because, the fornamed towne
and countye were holden of the 
                     •
                  rledom of Artoys, he chaunged the 
                     •
                  enure,
and solemply auowed to holde thesame toune &amp; coūtie of our Lady
of Bulleyn, and therof did homage to the Image in y• great Church
called our Lady church in Bulleyn, offring there a hart of gold, weiyng
ii.M. Crounes, ordenyng farther that all hys heyres and successors, at
their entrie into the estate and dignitie royal, by them self, or their deputie
should offer a hart of lyke weight and value, as a releue &amp; homage
done, or made for thesame toune and countie. You maye be sure that
the kyng of England would not haue suffered the French kyng to haue
edefied such a couert nest, so nere his toune of Caleis, and the territories
of thesame, except hys leage had bound hym, or that he had to much affyance
in the French kyng, whose hart was doble, &amp; whose wit euer incōstāt,
but surely the hope of the prefermēt of his daughter, both brought
hym to blyndnes and dotage. Let these doynges ouer passe &amp; se how
politikely the French kyng wrought for his aduantage. Duryng these
gaynes in the lowe partes, he caused the duke of Lorayn to enter into
hygh Burgoyn with a great army, whiche by policie &amp; promises brought
the whole Duchie vnder obedience of the French kyng, which then
claymed to haue the order and mariage of the yonge lady, as a pupille,
ward and orphane, aperteyning to the croune of Fraunce, for the which
title after rose no smal mischief, and troble in Flaunders, and the coū
                  treys

priuy displeasure was openly appeased, but not inwardly forgottē nor
outwardly forgeuen, for that, not withstandyng a seruaunt of the Dukes
was sodainly accused (I can not say of treuth, or vntruely suspected
by the Dukes enemyes) of poysonyng, sorcery, or inchauntment, &amp; therof
condempned, and put to taste the paynes of death. The duke, whiche

               The Quene of Englande also had wryten in thys season too the

the counsayll of Flaunders, consyderinge that he was but a erle of a
meane estate, and she the greatest enheritrice of all Christendom at that
tyme, gaue but deafe hearynge to soo vnmete a request: the whiche desyre,
if the Fleminges had but geuen good eare to, or wyth gentell wordes
delayed the suyte, she had bothe bene succored and defended with a
good number, and not susteyned soo greate losse as she dyd. Whether
kynge Edwarde were not content wyth thys refusall, or that he trusted
more the Frenche kynges promyse, then all hys counsayll coulde se
cause, or that he was lothe to lese hys yerely tribute of fifty thousande
Crounes, he woulde in no wyse consent to sende any army into Flaunders,
agaynst the Frenche kynge: But he sent Ambassadours to kynge
Lewes with louynge and gentle letters, requyrynge hym to conclude
some reasonable peace, or els at the least to take a certayne truce wyth
her at hys request.
               The Ambassadors of Englande, wer highly receiued, bountefully fested,
and liberally rewarded: But answere to their desire, had thei none,
but y• shortely the Frenche kyng would sende Ambassadors, hostages, &amp;

or any aide or succor, could be to to her administred.
               
                  
And beside this, to staie kyng Edwarde, from takyng parte with her.
He wrote to hym, that if he would ioyne with hym in aide, or personally
make warre, in any parte of the Ladies territories, or dominions: that
then kyng Edward, should haue and enioye, to hym and his heires▪ the
whole Countie and Countrey of Flaunders,A greate offer made by the Frenche king to Kyng Edward the .iiii. discharged of all homage,
superioritie, and resorte to be claimed by the Frenche kyng, and his h

                  ires
and successors: and farther, he should haue the whole duchie of Brabant,
whereof the Frenche kyng offered, at his awne charge and co
                     ••
                  e,
to conquere foure, the chief and strongest tounes, within thesaied Duchie,
and theim in quiet possession, to deliuer to the Kyng of Englande,
grauntyng farther to paie to hym, tenne thousande Angels▪ toward his
charges: besides municions of warre and artilerie, whiche he promised
to lende hym, with men and cariage, for the conueighaunce of thesame.
               The kyng of Englande answered, that the tounes of Flanders, were
of no small strengthe, nor of no litle quantie, verie vneasie to bee kepte,
when thei wer conquered: and of no lesse force was the Duchie of Brabant,
with whom, his subiectes were bothe lothe, and not verie willyng
to haue warre there, consideryng▪ that theth
                     •
                  r was one of their common
trafficques and ventes, of all their Merchaundice: But if the Frenche
kyng would make hym partener, of his conquest in Picardy, renderyng
to hym parte of the tounes, all ready gotten and gained, as Boleigne
Mounstrell, and Abbeuile, then he would surely take his parte, and
aide hym with men, at his awne costes and charges. While this matter
was in answeryng, and repliyng again, the Frenche kyng spoyled
the young Princes, oftounes and Regions, and of the best Capitaines
that her father lefte▪ as the Lorde Cordes and other: wherefore for pure
necessitie of aide and strengthe, she maried with Maximilian, sonne to
Frederike the Emperor, whiche to his power, sore resisted the Frenche
Kyng, for makyng any inuasions into Flaunders, or other his wifes
landes and seigniories. This Princes conceiued of her husbande, in the
first yere of her mariage, a faire lady called Margaret, whom kyng Lewes
so phantesied, either to haue a publique peace, with Maximiliā her
father, by the whiche, he might staie all warre, and hostilitie betwene thē
and so by that meane, peaceably to enioy the countryes and tounes, by
hym stollen and faintly conquered, or els imagenyng by that onely damosell,
in conclusion to conioyne, the whole countrey of Flanders, and
the other dominions, therunto apperteinyng, to the croune of Fraunce,
(as he had no fewe tymes, before attempted and assaied). That he clerely
forgettyng, his promes made, written, and sworne to the kyng of Englande,
for the mariage of his daughter, solicited priuily the Lordes of
Flanders, to haue thesaied lady Margarete, to bee conioyned in matrimonie,
with the Dolphin his sonne, writynge and sendyng to the Kyng
of Englande, faire promises and flatteryng letters, when his purpose
was clerely vanished out of Englande, and fixed in Flanders, as you
shall hereafter well vnderstande.

all exterior inuasions, as ciuill warre, and intestine
trouble: whiche before that tyme, he had aboundantly tasted
and more then he was willyng, had bothe felte, and
had in continuall experience, beganne firste more then he
was before accustomed, to serche out the penall offences,
aswell of the chief of his nobilitie, as of other gentlemen, beyng propritaries
of greate possessions, or aboundantly furnished in goodes, beside
merchauntes, and other inferior persones. By the reason wherof, it was
of all men adiudged, more then doubted, consideryng his newe fame of
riches, and his gready appetite of money and treasure, that he would
proue hereafter, a sore and an exstreme Prince, emongest his subiectes,
and this immaginacion in especiall, wandred through the heddes of all
men, that after his brother the Duke of Clarence, was put to death, he
should saie, that all men should stande, and liue in feare of hym, and he
to be vnbrideled, and in doubte of no man. But his newe inuented practise,
and auaricious inuencion, what for other forein and outwarde affaires,
and what for the abbreuiatyng of his daies, in this transitorie
world (whiche wer within twoo yeres after consumed) toke some but no

is as greate a trouble, as a greate mischief, and as vnquiet a profite, to
the possessioners of riches, and suche as haue the fruicion or thesame: as
pouertie and aduersitie, are profitable and laudable, in other persones
whiche can, with pacient stomacke, and meke harte, beare and suffre the

                  , accordyng to the
appoyntmēt made and concluded, to be accomplished and
solempnized, and therfore, not onely wrote, but sent diuerse
messengers to the Frenche kyng, for the performaunce of thesame. The
Frenche kyng whiche neuer intended, to haue that mariage take effecte,
consideryng that the Dolphin, was muche younger, then the lady Elizabeth,
and for other causes, sent Ambassadors to the kyng of England
with faire woordes, and friuolous delaies, makyng his excuse, that he
had not sent for the kynges daughter to be maried to his sonne the dolphin,
accordyng to the league and treatie concluded, by the occasion of
his greate troubles, and busy warres, enterprised in high Burgoin, and
the lowe countreys, so that he was disgarnished, aswell of his nobilitie,
as of other menne of honor, to receiue her into his realme, accordyng to
her estate and degree: promisyng faithfully, shortly to sende for her, and

to conueigh her with suche a pompe and royall traine, that it should bee
to bothe their honors and laudes, and to the high contentacion, of the
Kyng of Englande and his Quene, whiche, no lesse then her husbande
desired, &amp; sore longed to se the conclusion, of thesaid mariage take effect.
               These Ambassadors were well feasted, and likewise rewarded, and so
toke their leaue: And within a conuenient season after, he sent other Orators,
whiche, were neuer in Englande before, to the intent that if their
predecessors beyng Ambassadors, had saied or concluded any thyng, (although
thei wer authorised so to do) yet if it might turne, to the Frenche
kynges preiudice or damage, thei might without blame, excuse themselfes
by ignoraunce, of that matter: affirmyng that thei had no commissiō
to common, or els once to enterprise, to medle with that matter. Or if he
perceiued that any thyng was like to be concluded, whiche sounded not
to his pleasure or profite, he would sende for his Ambassador, in greate
haste, and after sende another with newe instruccions, nothyng dependyng
on the olde.
               This fashion kyng Lewes, vsed with all Princes, to whom he sente
any Ambassadors, by the whiche he cōpassed many thynges, to his purpose,
and to their losse: But moste of all, he thus dalied with the kyng
of Englande, concernyng this mariage, onely to the intent, to kepe hym
still in amitie, aboue all other Princes. And for a truthe the Kyng of
Englande, beyng of no suspicious nature, so muche trusted, and gaue
to hym so muche confidence, that he thought the Sunne, would soner
haue fallen from his circle, then that kyng Lewes, either would haue
dissimuled, or broken his promise with hym.
               But who soner breaketh promes, then he that is mooste trusted, or
who soner deceiueth, then he to whom moste credence is attributed. And
on the other part, who is so sone begiled, as he that least mistrusteth, and
who soner falleth, then he that casteth no perill, but as in nothyng mistrustyng,
is no smal lightnes, so into muche trustyng, is to muche foly:
wherefore, if kyng Edward had either not to muche trusted, or mistrusted
the Frenche Kynges faire promises (as I would he had dooen in
deede) the croune of Fraunce, had not so increased in possessions and dominions,
to the greate glory, and strength of the realme: nor the Princes
of Burgoyne, had not so been plucked, hared, and spoyled, of her faire
tounes and Castles as she was, whiche chaunce, she beyng destitute of
frendes, and without comforte of defenders, by pacience perforce, was
compelled to suffre and sustein.
               This is the profite that all nacions get, by the faire promises, of the
Frēchmen. Thus is the league made with Lewes the Frēch kyng, fraudulently
glosed and dissimuled. Thus is the oth made, and sworne vpō
the holy Euangelistes violated, and contrary to the woorde, and honor
of a Prince, broken and falcefied: by whiche vntrue dealyng, and couert
dissimulyng, with his especiall and trustie frend, all men maie facilie se,
and more apparauntly then in a myrror perceiue, that the verie natural

condicion of the Frenche nacion, is pleasuntly to flatter, plentifully to
reward, and gloriously to glose, til thei haue once obteined, their pretensed
purpose, and haue their ambicious desire accomplished and satisfied
and that gain once gotten on their side, neither othe holdeth, nor frendship
continueth, nor yet humanitie and kyndnes before shewed, is once
regarded, or of them remembred: wherefore, myne aduise is, let all men
trust them, as thei fynde them.

                  IN this verie season, Iames the .iii. of that name, kyng of
Scottes, sent into England a solempne Ambassage, for to
haue the Lady Cicile, kyng Edwardes .ii. daughter, to be
maried to his eldest sonne, Iames Prince of Scotlande,
Duke of Rothesay, &amp; erle of Caricke. Kyng Edward &amp; his
counsaill, thinkyng that this affinitie, should bee aswell honorable, as
profitable to the realme, did not onely graunt, to his desire and demaūd
but also before hande disbursed, certain sommes of money, to the onely
intent, that the mariage should herafter, neither be interrupted nor broken,
vpon this condicion, that thesaied Matrimony, by any accedentall
meane, should in tyme to come, take no successe nor perfeccion: or that
kyng Edward would notifie, to the kyng of Scottes, or his counsaill,
that his pleasure was determined, to haue thesaid mariage, to be infringe
                     •
                  
and dissolued: Then the Prouost and merchauntes, of the toune of
Edenborough, should bee bounde for the repaiment, of thesaied some again.
Al which thynges wer, with great deliberacion concluded &amp; sealed,
in hope of cōtinual peace, and infringible amitie. But this kyng Iames
beyng a man of a sharpe wit, more wedded to his awne opiniō then reason
would scace bere, would neither here nor geue credite to theim, that
spake contrary to his awne phantesie, or this imagined opinion: And to
thintēt that no man should find fault, with his doynges, or reprehēd his
actes, he promoted and made counsailers, menne of basse lignage, and
lowe bloud and in especiall, Cochrane and his compaignie, by whose euill
aduise, and mischeuous instigacion, he so punished and greued his
nobilitie, bothe with emprisonment, exaccions, and death, that some of
their voluntarie will, went into Exile, and other fainyng cause to departe▪
fled into other landes, and straunge countreys. For the Duke of
Albanie, called Alexander, brother to kyng Iames, was exiled into
Fraunce but passyng through Englande, he taried with kyng Edward
as you shall heare. Ther
                     •
                  e of Mar, a wise pollitique counsailer, was in
Edenborough bee hedded: And beside this, he forgettyng his othe, promise,
and affinitie, concluded with kyng Edward, caused armies to bee
made, into Englande, spoylyng, burnyng, and killyng, the kynges faith
full subiectes: at the whiche vnprincely dooyng, the kyng of Englande
beyng, not a litle moued and chafed, determined to be reuenged on hym
by battaill, and dent of sworde. Yet notwithstandyng, because kyng Iames

craftely excusyng hymself, alleging the mischief late cōmitted, to be
attempted, doen, &amp; perpetrated, without his concent, knowlege▪ or counsail,
this matter had been lightly pacified, and blowen ouer, 
                     〈◊〉
                   the Duke
of Albanie, beyng with kyng Edward, had not incēsed, entised, and prouoked
hym, to make warre on the Scottishe kyng, his brother, bothe to
reuenge the iniuries of late, to thesaid kyng doen, contrary to all lawes
of armes, and Princely demeanure, and also, to helpe to restore thesaied
duke, to his possessiōs, and dominions again: out of the whiche, he was
by the kyng his brother, dispossessed, and reiected 'promisyng to kyng
Edwarde, greate aide and assistence, when his armie was once entered,
into the confines of Scotlande.
               Kyng Edward beyng thus perswaded by the Duke, and trustyng on
his aide, was somwhat agreable to this, but the inward remembraunce
how that kyng Iames, had supported against hym, with men and money,
his olde enemie kyng Henry the sixt: and also trustyng, that if Alexander
duke of Albanie, by his adie should vanquishe his brother, and
obtain the croune of Scotland, he would be alwaies to hym sure▪ faithfull,
&amp; trustie: whiche did so enflame his corage, &amp; set his harte so on fire,
that he determined with al diligence, with an armie royall, to inuade the
countrey of Scotlande, and make the kyng to knowe, that he had neither
honorably, nor truly kept his league and promise: Wherfore, al the
winter season, he mustred his souldiers, prepared his ordinance, rigged
his shippes, and left nothyng apperteignyng to the warre, vnpurueyed
or vnloked for: so that in the beginnyng of the yere, al thynges wer prepared,
and nothyng was missed.

                  WHen all thynges apperteignyng, to the furniture of suche
an enterprise, were put in a readines, and ready to bee sette
forward: kyng Edward appoynted, to be cheuetain of his
hooste, and Lieuetenaunt generall, his brother Richarde
Duke of Gloucester, and to hym associated, Henry, the .iiij
Erle of Northumberlande, Thomas Lorde Stanley, Lorde Steward
of his houshold, the lorde Louell, and the lorde Greystocke, and diuerse
other noble men and knightes. These valiaūt capitaines, set forward in
Maie, and made suche diligence, with pollitique cōueighaunce of their
souldiers: beside the troubelous cariage, of their ordinaunce, that thei
came to the toune of Alnewike, in Northumberlande, aboute the beginnyng
of Iuly, where thei firste encamped theimselfes, and Marshalled
their hoste. The forward was led, by therle of Northumberlande, vnder
whose standerd were, the lorde Scrope of Bolton, sir Ihon Middelton,
sir Ihon Dichfeld, and diuerse other Knightes, Esquiers and souldiers
to the nombre of sixe thousande, and seuen .C. men. In the middell ward
was the Duke of Gloucester, and with hym the Duke of Albany, the
lorde Louell the lorde Greystocke, sir Edwarde Woduile and other, to
the nombre of fiue thousande, and eight .C. menne. The Lorde Neuell

was appoynted to folowe, accompaignied with .iii.M. men. The lorde
Stanley, led the wyng on the right hande, of the Dukes battaill, with
iiii.M. men, of Lancashire and Chesshire: The lefte wyng was guyded
by the lorde Fitz Hewe, sir Willyam a Parte, sir Iames Harryngton,
with the nombre of .ii.M. men, and beside all these, there was a thousād
men appoynted, to geue attendance on the ordinaunce. This royall armie,
not intendyng to slepe, but to geue the Scottes knowlege, of their
arriuall in those parties, came sodainly by the water side, to the toune of
Berwicke, and there, what with force, and what with feare of so greate
an armie, toke and entered the toune: but therle Bothwell, beyng Capitain
of the Castle, would in nowise deliuer it, neither for flatteryng wordes,
nor for manacyng bragges, wherefore, the capitaines deliberately
consultyng together, planted a strong siege, and enuironed it rounde aboute.
When this siege was thus laied the twoo Dukes, and all the other
souldiers, except the lorde Stanley, sir Ihon Elryngton, threasorer
of the kynges house, sir Willyam a Parre, and .iiii.M. men, that were
lefte behinde, to kepe the siege before the Castle▪ departed frō Berwicke,
toward Edenborough: And in marchyng thetherward, he brent and destroyed
these tounes folowyng.

small cōfidence in his commonaltie, and lesse trust in his nobilitie,

did voluntarely incarcerate &amp; enclose hym selfe in the strong Castell of
Maydens in Edenborough, perfitly trustyng there to be out of all doubtes
&amp; daunger, except famyn or treason, caused hym violently to opē
the portes or gates, whereof the duke of Glocester entered into the toune
and at the especial request &amp; desire of the duke of Albany, saued y• toune
and thenhabitantes of thesame, from fier, bloud &amp; spoyle, takynge onely
such presentes as the merchātes gentelly offered him &amp; his capitaynes:
Causing Gartier, principal kyng at armes, to make a publique Proclamacion
at the high Crosse in the market place of Edenboroughe, in the
which he warned &amp; admonished, Iames kyng of Scottes, to kepe, obserue
&amp; performe all such promises, cōpactes, couenantes &amp; agrementes
as he had concluded &amp; sealed to, with the high and mighty Prince Edward,
by the grace of God kyng of England. &amp;c. And also to make cō
                  digne
and sufficient recompence to his subiectes, for the great tyrannye
spoyle and crueltye, that he and his people had perpetrate &amp; committed
cōtrary to his league, within the marches and territories of his realme
of Englande, before the firste daye of August nexte ensuynge.
               And farther without delay to restore the high and mighty prince Alexander,
duke of Albanie, his naturall brother to his estate, &amp; all his offices
possessions and authorities, in as ample and liberall maner, as he
before occupied and enioyed thesame: or the high and valiaunte prince
Rychard duke of Glocester, leuetenaunt generall, and chiefetayne for y•
kyng of England, was redy at hand to destroy him, his people and coū
                  trey
with slaughter, flame &amp; famyn.
               Kyng Iames would make no aunswere, neither by woorde nor by
writing, knowing that his power now fayled, either to performe the request
demaunded, or to defend his countrey with such a puissant armye
inuaded. The lordes of Scotland, lyeng at Hadyngton with a great
puyssaunce, hearyng the kynge of Englandes reasonable desyre, determined
firste to practise wyth the Duke of Glocester for a peace,
and so to haue the Castell of Berwycke to their parte, and after by some
meanes to allure the duke of Albanye, from the English amitie, &amp; vpon
this mocion, the .ii. day of August they wrote to the duke of Glocester,
that the mariage betwene the prince of England shoulde be accomplisshed
in all poyntes, according to the couenantes agreed, and the instrumentes
therof engrosed, rquyryng farther that a peace from thens
                     •
                  urth
might be louyngly concluded betwene bothe the Realmes. The duke
of Glocester wisely and circumspectly certefied thē agayn, that as touchyng
the article of mariage, to take effect betwene their prince and the
lady Cicilie of England, he knew not the determinat pleasure of y• king
his master and brother, either for the affirmaunce or deniāce of thesame
but he desyred full restitucion of all such summes of money, as for the
sayd mariage before time had ben disbursed, or prested out in loue. And
where the sayd lordes desyred to haue a peace, concluded from thensfurth,
betwene both the sayd realmes. He fyrst required to haue the Castell

of Barwyke to him deliuered, or at the lest, if he did agre to y• sayd
peace, that then his siege, lyeng about the sayd Castel, should be hereafter
in any wise, neither troubled, vexed, nor molested, nor ye king of Scottes,
nor none of his subiectes, nor any other by his procurement or prouoking,
should ayde, comfort or assist with victayle, ordinaūce, or other
wise the Capitayne, Constable, or souldiers of the sayd Castel, durynge
the siege.
               The Lordes, Prelates, Barons, and estates of the realme of Scotlande,
perceyuing &amp; wel pondering, bothe the answer &amp; the demaundes
of the duke of Glocester, sent to him sufficiently enstructed with these
conclusions, the reuerend father Andrew, elect of Murray, and the lord
Ihon De
                     •
                  nele, which thus answered, that where the sayd duke desyred
repayment of ye summes of money, delyuered in part of payment, for the
contract of mariage, to be made betwene the prince of Scotland and y•
kynges daughter of England: the tyme of lawfull contract of mariage
is not yet come, because of the minoritie of the said prince and princesse.
And the faute hereof is, that no day was apoynted for the money, to be
payed before the contract began. And if the king your brother woulde
demaunde farther assurance, either for the contract to be made, or for y•
payment of the money, they promised therunto, accordinge to reason to
agre. Secondarely, as touching the Castel of Berwike, they sayd al we
know wel ynough, that it is the olde enheritance of the croune of Scotlande,
of many hundred yeres past, and that our souereigne lorde hath
right thereunto. And if it be alleged, that it belonged to the realme of
England by conquest, it is well knowen that it standeth in Scotland,
&amp; ouer the Scottish ground. The duke, not withstandinge their saiynges,
would cōdiscend to no peace, without the Castel of Barwyke were
rendered to the kyng of England, and so y• messengers departed, and on
thesame day the Archebishop of sainct Andrewes, the bishop of Dūkelle
Colyn, erle of Argyle, lord Cambell and lorde Andrew, lord Auandale,
Chaunceler of Scotlande, wrote vnto the duke of Albanye a solempne
and autenticall instrumēt, signed and sealed with their seales, binding
their bodies, landes and goodes to the sayd duke, that if he would hereafter
be obedient to the kyng of Scottes, and kepe &amp; obserue his fayth
and promise to be made to the sayd lordes, that he shoulde not onely be
restored to all his landes, hereditamentes, offices &amp; possessions, whiche
he enioyed at the day of his departure out of Scotland, but also should
haue and enioy to him, &amp; his seruauntes &amp; familiers a fre and a general
Pardon, which restitucion and pardon, thei likewise promised to be ra
                  
                     ••
                  fied
&amp; approued by the kyng and the .iii. estates assembled at the next
Parliament. The duke beyng glad to be restored agayne to his olde
estate &amp; possessions, &amp; especially in his awne natiue countrey, receyued
their offer, which was truly performed, &amp; so toke his leue of the duke of
Glocester, thankyng hym (as he was no lesse bounde) for the greate labour,
traueyll &amp; peyne, that he had taken in hys awne person for his restitucion.

And promised bothe by word &amp; by writing of his awne hande
to do &amp; performe all such thinges, as he before that tyme had sworne &amp;
promised to kyng Edwarde, notwithstanding any agremēt, now made
or to be made with the lordes of Scotland: and for the performance of
theffect of the sayde Scedule, he agayne toke a corporall othe before ye
duke of Glocester, and sealed the writyng the thyrd day of August in ye
English Cāpe at Leuyngton, besydes Hadyngton, anno .M.cccc.lxxxii
and departed to hys awne possessions. After he was thus restored &amp; reconciled,
the lordes of Scotland proclaymed hym great lieuetenaūt of
Scotland, &amp; in the kynges name made Proclamacion, y• all mē shoulde
be redy, vpon peyne of death within .viii. dayes at Craushaues, both to
rayse the siege before the Castell, and for the recoueringe agayne of the
towne of Barwyke. The duke of Albanye wrote all this preparaciō to
the duke of Glocester, hūbly requiring hym to haue no mistrust in hym
promising to kepe his othe &amp; promise, made to kyng Edward &amp; to hym.
The duke of Glocester wrote to hym agayne, that it shoulde neither be
honorable nor commendable in hym, too helpe, to reise the siege, at the
layeng whereof he was counsayler &amp; partener, nor yet to reward ye king
of England, with such a displeasure for his kyndnes costes and expēses
to hym in hys extreme necessitie, louingly shewed and liberally exhibited.
But he assured hym in the woord of a Prince, that if he &amp; all the power
of Scotland attempted to come to rayse the siege, planted before ye
Castell of Barwyke, that he hym selfe with hys armye woulde defende
the besegiers, or els dye in the quarell.
               The counsayl of Scotlande sagely &amp; poletiquely sawe before, that if
they shoulde come to reyse the siege, that the duke of Glocester woulde
with them shortly encoūter, and then if they lost the felde, both y• strēgth
of the Realme was brought to an imbecilitie, the nobles sore minished,
and the castell lost and taken. And on the other side, if they obtayned
victorie, nothyng was gotten but the pore towne of Barwyke, and thei
were likely sone to be inuaded with a greater power shortly agaī, wherfore
they sent Lyon kyng at Armes to the duke of Glocester, offering to
hym as they thought, two offers very reasonable, the one was, that if he
would promise on his honor to subuerte and cast doune the toune walles
of Barwyke, they would likewise race, and clerely deface the walles
Towres and portes of the Castell, or els the duke of Glocester to put in
a capitayn and a garrison of men of warre into the towne, and the duke
of Albanye, likewise to do with the Castell, for the Tuycion of thesame.
And farther the forsayd Lyon desired an abstinēce of warre to be takē,
tyll the two dukes might haue cōmunicacion of grauous matters, concernyng
the welthes of bothe the Realmes. The duke of Glocester refused
bothe the offers saiyng, that he had long mainteined the siege before
the Castell of Barwyke, to no small waste and exhaustyng of hys brothers
treasure and ryches, and to the great trauayle and payne of the
Lordes, Gentilmen, and men of warre, that continuallye made there

abode and dayly residens at the sayd seige: wherfore he sayd, that he in
this poynt was fermely resolued, not to departe tyll the Castel were yelded
by apoyntement, or taken by force, or els hys siege were by the power
of Scotland reysed, or he and hys armye vanquished: wherfore he
would by no meane harken to the peticion of the Scottishe lordes, concernyng
the abstinence of warre, tyll he were either vanquished or possessed
of the Castell of Barwyke. With whiche answere the Herault departed,
and thereof made relacion to the lordes and counseyll of Scotland.
Whē the dukes answere was of them well digested, they euidētly
perceyuing that the castell of Barwyke was the onely maker of ye peace
and that the not deliuery of thesame, should be the norice and continuer
of warre and hostilitie: consideringe farther, that the nobilitie nor commons
of Scotland, dyd not draw together by one lyne, nor were sorted
in one leuell, electyng and chosyng the better parte, and reiectinge and
auoydynge the worse, agreed and determined to deliuer the Castell of
Barwyke to the English partie, so that there shoulde be truce or abstinence
of warre taken and concluded for a determinate season. And thervpō
they sent to the duke of Glocester a league indēted, which was dated
the .xxiiii. day of August, in the yere of our lorde a .M.cccc.lxxxii. in
the which it was contracted and agreed betwene the duke of Glocester,
lieutenaūt general for the kyng of Englande, and Alexander duke of
Albanye, lieuetenaūt for Iames kyng of Scottes, that an especial abstinence
of warre should be kept and obserued betwixte the Realmes of
England and Scotland, and the people of thesame, aswell by sea as by
lāde, to begyn the .viii. day of September next ensuyng, and to endure
tyll the .iiii. day of Nouember next folowyng. And in the meane season,
the towne and castel of Barwyke, to be occupyed, and be in ye reall possession
of suche as by the kyng of Englandes deputie, should be apointed
and assigned with all and singuler such boundes, limites and territories
as the English uacion, last vsed and possessed, when the castell &amp;
towne were in the subieccion of the Englishmen. And all other marches
and boundes, beyng in difference betwene the sayd Realmes, to stande
and to be holden in lyke case and condicion, as they were before the last
truce concluded. The duke of Glocester, which well perceyued that the
Scottes more graunted to hys demaūdes, for relieue of their awne necessitie,
then to gratefie hym or the kyng hys brother in any poynt: like
a wyse counseyler, toke hys aduantage when it was offered, and especially
because these thynges made for hys longe desyred purpose.
               Fyrst the deliuery of the Castell of Barwyke, he voluntarely without
counsayl (as a praye priuely gotten) both accepted and alowed, and
for that onely cause he dyd not refuse the abstinence of warre, but too
that gentely agreed. As touching the possession, to be kept in the landes
dependyng in variance betwene the Realmes (comenly called the batable
grounde) he woulde not, nor durst not conclude with the duke of Albanye,
without hauyng farther intelligence of the kyng hys souereigne

lordes pleasure and counsaill, meanynge thereby euer to kepe them as
sueters to hym, &amp; he no farther to seke on theim, and in the meane season
to let that matter be in suspence. Whē he had sealed to the fyrst two Articles,
and that they were sent agayne to the lordes of Scotlande, they
them gladly receyued, and with good will embrased, and likewyse truly
performed thesame: for the castell of Barwyke was incontinent deliuered
to the lord Stanley, and other thereto appoynted, whiche therein
put bothe Englishe men and artilerie, sufficiente for the defence of all
Scotland for .vi. monethes. By this meanes as you haue harde, the
Englishmen repossessed agayn the towne &amp; castell of Barwyke, whiche
xxi. yeres before by kyng Hēry the .vi. was to the Scottes as you haue
hard geuen vp and deliuered. And lest peraduenture the duke of Glocester
might thynke that the duke of Albanye dyd not in all thynges set
forward, prefer, and auance hys fyrst requestes and demaundes, made
and requyred of the lordes of Scotland, and in especial one which was
for the assurance to be made for the repayment to the kyng of England,
of all suche summes of money, as he had beforehand prested &amp; disbursed
to the kynge of Scottes for the mariage to be solempnised &amp; consummate
betwene their chyldern, as before is rehersed: Therfore y• sayd
duke of Albanye, caused the Prouost and Burgesses of Edenborough
to make a sufficient instrument obligatorie, to kynge Edward, for the
trew satisfaccion and contentaciō of thesame money, which he also sent
by thesaied Prouost to the Duke of Glocester to Alnewyke: The very
Copy hereafter foloweth.
               
                  Be it knowē to all men by thele present letters, vs Walter Bartraham,
Prouost of the towne of Edēboroug in Scotland, and the whole
felowship, marchaūtes, burgesses, and communaltye of thesame towne,
to be bounde and oblished by their presentes, vnto the most excellent &amp;
most mighty prynce Edward, by the grace of God kyng of Englande.
That where it was commoned and agreed, betwene hys excellencie on
the ta parte, and the right high and mighty prince our souereigne lord,
Iames king of Scottes on the other parte, that mariage and matrimonie
should haue ben solempnised, and had betwixt a mightye and excellent
prynce, Iames the first begotten sonne and heyre apparant to our
soueraigne lord foresayd, and the right noble princes Cicilie daughter,
to the sayd Edward kyng of Englād, and for the sayd mariage to haue
ben performed certayne and diuers great summes of money ben payed
and contented by the most excellent prince, vnto oure soueraigne lorde
forsayd, as by certayn wrytynges betwixt the sayde princes, thereupon
made more at large playnly appeares: That if it be the pleasure of the
sayd Edward kyng of England, to haue the sayd mariage to be performed
and completed accordynge to the sayd communicacion in writing,
that then it shall be well and truely, without fraude, disceyte or collusion,
obserued, keped, and accomplished on the partie of our souereigne
lord foresayd, and the nobles spirituall and temporall of the Realme of

Scotland. And if it be not the pleasure of the sayd excellent prince Edward
kyng of England, to haue the sayd mariage performed and completed:
That then we Walter Prouost, burgesses, marchantes, and cō
                     mons
of the abouenamed towne of Edenboroughe, or any of vs, shall
pay and content to the kyng of Englande foresayde, all the summes of
money that was payed for the sayd mariage, at syke lyke termes and
dayes, immediatly ensuen, after the refusall of the sayd mariage, and in
syke lyke maner and forme, as the sayde summes were afore deliuered,
contented and payed, that than this obligacion and bond to be voyd, &amp;
of no strēgth. Prouided alwayes, that the sayd Edward kynge of England,
shall geue knowlege of hys pleasure and eleccion in the premisses
in taking or refusing of ye sayd mariage, or of repaymēt of the said summes
of money, to our sayd souereygne lord, or lordes of hys counsayll,
or to vs the sayd Prouost, merchaūtes, or any of vs, within the realme
of Scotland, beyng for the tyme, betwixt this and the feaste of Alhalowes
next to come. To the whihc payment well and truly to be made, we
bynde and oblishe vs, and euery of vs, our heyres, succession, executors
and all our goodes, merchaundises, and thynges whatsoeuer they bee,
where so euer, or in what place, by water or by lande, on this syde y• sea,
or beyond, we shall happen to be founden, any leage, truse or sauegard
made or to be made, notwithstanding. In wytnes wherof to thys oure
present writyng, &amp; letters of bonde. We, the sayde Prouost, Burgesses,
Merchauntes and commontye haue set our common seale of the sayde
towne of Edenborough▪ the fourth daye of August, the yere of God .M
cccc.xxii. Geuen in the presence of the right mighty Prince Richarde
duke of Gloucester, Alexander duke of Albanye, a reuerende father in
God, Iames bishop of Dunkeld▪ and the ryght noble lord Henry erle
of Northumberlande, Colyn erle of Argile, Thomas lorde Stanley,
Master Alexander English and other. &amp;c.
               
               When the duke of Glocester had thus obteyned hys purpose, and
receyued writynges signed and sealed for the performance of thesame,
he sent the instrumentes to kyng Edward hys brother, whiche muche
cōmended bothe hys valiaunt manhode, and also hys prudent pollicie,
in conueyng hys busines, bothe to hys awne purpose, and also to the
profit of the Realme. Kyng Edward, not a littel mused, and much more
debated wyth hys counsayl, whether it were more profitable and honorable
to hym and hys Realme, to suffer the sayde mencioned mariage,
to take effect, and procede to a conclusion, or els to requyre a repaymēt,
and redelyuery of the summes of money, apprompted and layde out for
thesame purpose. After long consultacion had, and it was considered in
what case the realme &amp; ye kyng of Scottes stode in, for it was wel knowen
that he and hys nobilitie were at great discord as you before haue
hearde: it was considered farther, that if the nobilitie preuayled, and
gat the souerayntie, the lyne and succession of Iames the thyrde, were
likely to be totally extirpate, &amp; disinherited for euer: it was also alleged

that the prince of Scotlande, neuer condiscended nor as he hymselfe
sayd, woulde agre to thys mocioned mariage. These thynges thus debated,
the kyng by great aduice, refused and reuoked all thynges to be
done, for the more forwardnes of the sayde matrimony, and elected and
chose the repayment of all suche summes of money, as for the occasion
of the sayde betrusted mariage was payd, and before hand contented &amp;
deliuered. And accordynge to the woordes of obligacion, made by the
towne of Edenborough, he sent Gartier, hys principal kyng of Armes
and Northumberland Herault, to declare and intimate to the Prouost
and burgesses of Edenborough, the determinate refusall of the future
matrimony, and the eleccion and choyse of the repayment of the money

                     •
                  nd duety. And for the farther ouerture of the whole conclusion. Gartier
was instructed by writyng, what he should saye and declare: and so
by conuenient iorneys came to the towne of Edenborough .viii. dayes
before the feast of all sayntes, where he openly sayde as foloweth:
               I gartier kynge of armes seruaunt, proctour and messenger vnto the
most hygh and mighty prince, my most dread soueraygne lord Edward
by the grace of God, kyng of Englande and of Fraunce, and lorde of
Ireland, by vertue of certain letters of procuracie here redy to be shewed
to me, by my sayd souereygne lord made and geuen, make notyce
and geue knowlege vnto you Prouost, Burgesses, marchauntes and
communaltie of the towne of Edenborough in Scotlande, that where
as it was sometyme commoned and agreed, betwene my sayde soueraygne
lorde on the one partie, and the righte hygh and mighty prince
Iames kyng of Scottes, on the other partie, ye mariage &amp; matrimony
should haue been solempnised, and had betwene Iames the first begotten
sonne of the said kyng of Scottes, and lady Cicilie, daughter to my
sayd souereygne lord the kyng of England. And for the sayde mariage
to haue ben performed▪ certayne and dyuers greate summes of money,
ben payed and contented by my sayde souereygne lord, whiche summes
of money, in cace of refusall of the sayde mariage, by my sayde souereygne
lorde to be made and declared, ye the sayd Prouost, Burgesses,
marchauntes and communaltie, and euery one of you are bounde and
obliged by your letters vnder youre comon seale of your toune of Edē
                  borough,
to repaye vnto hys hyghnes vnder lyke forme, and at suche
termes as they were fyrst payed. So that the kyng my souereygne lord
woulde make notice and knowlege of hys pleasure, and eleccion in talkyng
or refusynge of the sayde mariage, of the repayment of the sayde
summes of money, before the feast of Alhalowes nexte to come, lyke as
in your sayde letters, bearynge date at Edenboroughe the fourthe day
of August last past, it was conteyned all at large. The pleasure and eleccion
of my sayd souereygne lord, for dyuers causes and consideracions
hym mouynge, is to refuse the accomplishement of the sayde mariage,
and to haue the repayment of all suche summes of money, as by occasion
of the sayde betrusted mariage, hys hyghnes had payed. The sayd

repaymente to be had of you Prouoste, Burgesses, merchauntes and
communaltie, and euery of you, youre heyres and successours, accordynge
to your bonde and obligacion afore rehersed. And therefore I
geue you notice and knowlege by thys writynge, whiche I deliuer too
you, within the terme in your sayde letters lymitted and expressed to all
ententes and effectes, which therof maye ensue.
               When Gartier had thus declared al thinges, geuen to him in charge,
the Prouost or other Burgesses made aunswere, that they now knowynge
the kynges determinate pleasure, woulde accordynge to theyr
bonde, prepare for the repayment of the sayde summes, and gentelly enterteynyng
Gartier cōueyghed hym to Barwyke, from whēce he departed
to new Castell, to the ouke of Glocester, makyng relacion to hym of
all hys doynges, whiche duke with all spede returned too Shrythuton,
and there abode. Shortly after Gartiers departynge, the duke of
Albanye, thynkyng to obteyne agayne the hygh fauoure of the kynge
hys brother, deliuered hym out of captiuitie and pryson, wherin he had
a certaine space continued (not without the dukes assente, whiche besieged
hym in the Castell of Edenborough a littell before) &amp; set him at large,
of whome vtwardly he receyued great thankes, when inwardly nothynge
but reuengyng and confusion was in the kynges stomacke incorporate,
so that shortly after in the kynges presence, he was in icopardye
of hys lyfe, and all improuided for dread of death, coacted to take a
small balynger, and to sayle into Fraunce, where shortly after tydynge
by the men of armes, which encontered at the tylt, by Lewes then duke
of Orliaunce, after Frenche kyng he was with mischarging of a speare
by fortunes peruerce countenaunce pytyfullye slayne and broughte to
death, leauyng after hym one onely sonne, named Ihon, whiche beynge
banished Scotland, enhabited and maried in Fraunce, and there died.
How dolorous, how sorowfull is it to wryte, and muche more pencifull
to remember the chaunces, &amp; infortunites that happened within twoo
yere in Englande and Scotlande, betwene naturall bretherne. For
kyng Edward set on by suche as enuied the estate of the duke of Clarence,
forgettyng nature, and fraternall amitie, consented to the deathe
of hys sayde brother. Iames kynge of Scottes, puttynge in obliuion
that Alexander hys brother was the onely Organe and instrument, by
whome he obteyned libertie and fredome, seduced and led by Uyle and
malicious persons, whiche maligned at the glorie and indifferent iustice
of the duke of Albanye, imagened and compassed hys deathe, and
exiled him for euer? what a pernicious serpent, what a venemous tode, &amp;
what a pestiferous Scorpion is that deuelishe whelpe, called priuye
enuye? Agaynst it no fortres can defend, no caue can hyde, no wood can
shadow, no foule can escape, nor no beaste can auoyde, her poyson is so
stronge, that neuer man in authoritie coulde escape from the bytyng of
her tethe, scrachyng of her pawes, blastyng of her breath, defoulynge of
her tayle.
               
                  Wherefore, let euery indifferent persone, serche Histories, rede Chronicles,
looke on aucthores, aswell holy as prophane, and thei shall apparauntly
perceiue, that neither open warre, daily famyne, or accustomed
mortalitie, is not so muche an enemie, nor so greate a malle to destroye,
and suppeditate high power and nobilitie, as is roted malice,
inwarde grudge, and dissimuled hatred. Although that kyng Edwarde
wer glad and ioyous, of all the prosperous successe, of all enterprises in
the realme of Scotlande, yet euen now his Feuer tercian, of the whiche
he had languished sore, sithe his voyage royall into Fraunce, was sodainly
turned into a vncurable quartain: For where he was before tossed,
betwene hope and dispaire, sometyme hote, sometyme colde, that the
Matrimonie of his daughter, and Charles the dolphin, should come to
the solempnizacion, accordyng to the leage, betwene him and the Frēche
kyng, concluded at Picquegnie: Now was he cast into an indissoluble
Melancoly, and a continuall cold: For the lorde Hawarde, whiche was
returned out of Fraunce, with many faire wordes, and painted promises
but without tribute, or conclusiō of the marige, certified the kyng of his
awne knowlege: how that he beyng present, sawe the lady Margarete of
Austrice, daughter to Duke Maximilian, sonne to the Emperor Fredericke,
receiued into Fraunce, with pompe more then Emperiall, by the
Duke of Burbon, the lorde Dalbret, and many other lordes and magistrates
of the realme, and so with greate triumphe, conueighed to Amboyse,
where the Dolphin laie, and there was to hym contracted and espoused.
Kyng Edwarde now beyng certain, how the Frenche kyng had
with pleasaunt language, and colourable answeres, foded hym furthe,
and allured hym to geue credence, to his dissimulyng woordes, neither
meanyng as he saied, nor shewyng what he meante: Determined with
hymself, no longer to suffre so apparaunt wrong, nor so intollerable an
iniurie. Wherfore, he called his nobilitie together, and declared to them
the manifold wrong, whiche he had receiued of late, at the handes of the
Frenche kyng, and how he vntruly, and vnprincely, had broken the league
and amitie, bothe in deniyng the paiment of the tribute, as also, in
refusyng the accomplishmēt of the mariage of his daughter, accordyng
as in the treatie was concluded. Requiryng them therfore to study, how
to reuenge and punishe, so greate a shame, and so opprobrious a taunt,
offered to their natiue Countrey. The nobilitie not a litle glad of this
mocion, answered: that their whole desire was, to fight with the Frenche
men, whom thei so oftē times had vanquished, &amp; profligated in battail,
and that for the dignitie, and fame of their Conntrey, thei would let nothyng
be vnatempted, offeryng hym in an instant, to be ready in harnes
to fulfill his mynde and desire. When he knewe the toward myndes of
his subiectes, of the Temporaltie, he moued the Spiritualtie (because
by the Ecclesiasticall lawes, thei be prohibited to weare armure) to aide
hym with money, for mainteinaunce of his warres, and suppressyng of
his enemies.
            
            
               
               The .xxiii. yere.The .xxiii. yere.
               
               
                  BEholde, while he was intentiue, and amployed his whole
labor, diligence, and industrie, to furnishe and setforward
this warre, whiche he newly had attempted and begonne:
whether it was with the melencoly, and anger that he toke
with the Frenche kyng, for his vntruthe and vnkyndnes,
or were it by any superfluous surfet (to the whiche he was
muche geuen) he sodainly fell sicke, and was with a gr
                     •
                  uous maledy taken,
yea, so greuously taken, that his vitaill spirites, began to faile and
waxe feble, whiche debilitie when he perceiued, he called together all his
nobles, whiche, that tyme wer aboute London, vpon one daie (as he did
diuerse tymes commen with them) and thus in effect, to theim saied. My
welbeloued, and no lesse betrusted frendes, counsailers, and alies, if wee
mortall men would daily and hourely, with our self reuolue, and intētiuely
in our hartes engraue, or in our mindes grauously pōder, the fraile
and fadyng imbecilitie, of our humain natur▪ and the caduke fragilitie
of thesame: wee should apparauntly perceiue, that we beyng called reasonable
creatures, and in that predicament, compared and ioyned with
Angelles, bee more worthy to be numcupate, and de
                     •
                  ed persones vnresonable,
and rather to bee associate in that name with brute beastes, called
vnreasonable (of wohse life and death, no creature speaketh) rather
then in that poynt, to bee tesembled to the Angelicall societie, and reasonable
compaignie. For while health in vs florisheth, or prosperitie abundeth,
or the glosyng worlde laugheth, whiche is he, so reasonable of
vs all▪ that can saie (if he will not erre from the truthe) that he, once in a
weke remēbred his fatall ende, or the prescribed terme of his enduryng:
or once prouided by labor, study, or otherwise, to set a stedfast and a sure
ordre, for the securitie, and profite, continuanuce either of his possessions
and dominions, or of his sequele and posteritie, whiche after hym shall
naturally succede: suche is the blyndnes, of our fraile and fragile nature,
euer geuen to carnal concupiscence, and mundain delectacion, daily
ob
                     •
                  uscate and seduced, with that lothargious, and deceiable serpent,
called hope of long life, that all wee put in obliuion, our duetie present,
and lesse remembre the pollitique purueighaunce, for thynges to come:
For blyndly we walke in this fraile life, till we fall grouelyng with our
iyes, sodainly vpon death. The vanities of this worlde, bee to vs so agreable,
that when we begin to liue, we esteme our life, a whole worlde,
whiche once ouerpassed, it sheweth no better but dust, driuen a way with
a puffe of wynde: I speake this to you of my self, and for your selfes to
you, sore samentyng▪ and inwardly bewailyng, that I did not performe
and finally cōsumate, suche pollitique diuises, and good and Godly ordinaunces,
in my long life and paciffique prosperitie, whiche, then I fully
determined to haue begonne, set forward, and completly to haue finished.
Whiche, now for the extreme paines, and tortures of my angrie
maladie, and for the small terme of my naturall life, I can neither performe,

neither yet liue to see, either to take effecte, or to short to take any
conclusion. For God I call to record, my harte was fully sette, and my
mynde deliberatly determined: so to haue decorated this realme, with
wholesome Lawes, statutes, and ordinaunces, so to haue educated and
brought vp myne enfantes and children, in vertue, learnyng, actiuitie,
and pollicie. That, what with their royall puyssaunce, and your frendly
assistence, the proudest Prince of Europe, durste not once attempte, to
moue any hostilitie, against them, you, or this realme: But oh Lorde, all
thynges that I of long tyme, haue in my mynde reuolued, and immagined,
that stelyng thief death, goeth about to subuerte, and in the momēt
of an houre, clerely to suppeditate, wherefore (as men saie) I now beyng
driuen to the verie hard wall: hauyng perfect confidence, and sure hope
in the approbate fidelitie, and constaunt integritie, whiche I haue euer
experimented, and knowen to bee radicate and planted, in the hartes of
your louyng bodies, toward me and myne. So that I maie saie and aduowe,
that neuer Prince bearyng scepter and Croune, ouer realmes and
regions, hath found or proued, more faithfuller counsailers, nor trewer
subiectes, then I haue doen of you, nor neuer Potentate nor gouernor,
put more affiaunce and truste, in his vassals and seruauntes, then I, sith
the adepcion of the Croune, fermely haue fixed, in your circumspect wisedomes,
and sober discresions. Am now of verie force compelled, liyng
in a dubious hope, betwene liuyng and diyng, betwene remembraunce
and obliuion, do require you and instauntly moue you, that as I haue
found you, faithfull, obediēt, and to all my requestes and desires, (while
I was here in healthe, conuersant with you) diligent and intentiue: So
after my death, my hope is with a sure anchor grounded, and myne inwarde
conceipte vndubitatly resolued, that the especiall confidence, and
inwarde fidelitie, whiche, so long hath continued betwene vs, beyng to
gether liuyng, shall not totally by my death, bee extincte and vanished
like smoke. For what auaileth frendshippe in life, when trust deceiueth
after death? What profiteth amitie in apparaunt presence, when confidence
is fraudulently beguiled in absence? What loue groweth, by coniunccion
of Matrimonie, if the ofspryng after dooe not agree and concorde?
Or what profiteth Princes, to auaunce and promote their subiectes,
if after their death, the bountifulnes by theim shewed, be of the receiuers
of thesame and their sequele, neither regarded nor yet remembered?
The parētes make the mariage, for an indissoluble amitie, Princes
promote sometyme for fauoure, sometyme for deserte, and sometyme for
pleasure: yet (if you will consider) the verie pricke, to the whiche all giftes
of promocions, do finally tend it, is to haue loue, fauor, faithful coū
                  saill,
and diligent seruice, of suche as be by them, promoted and exalted,
not onely in their awne lifes, beyng but brief and transitorie: But also,
that thei and their progeny, callyng to remembraunce, the fauor, estimacion,
and auauncement, which, thei of so liberal and munificent a prince
had receiued and obteined: should with spere and shelde, toungue and

wit, hande and penne, continually studie to defende, counsaill and prefer
not onely hym duryng his life, but also to serue, assist, and maintein his
sequ
                     •
                  le, and lineall succession, as the verie Images, and carnall portratures,
of his stirpe, line, and stemne, naturally discēded. In this case am
I, whom you knowe, not without ineffable trouble, and moste daungerous
wart, to haue obteined the scepter, and diademe of this realme and
Empire, duryng whiche reigne, I haue had either litle peace, or small
tranquilitie: And now when I thought my self, sure of a quiet life, and
worldly rest, death hath blowen his terrible trompet, callyng and somonyng
me (as I truste) to perpetuall tranquilitie, and eternall quietnes:
therefore now for the perfecte, and vnmoueable confidence, that I haue
euer had in you, and for the vnfained loue, that you haue euer shewed
vnto me, I commende and deliuer into your gouernaūce, bothe this noble
realme, and my naturall children, and your kynsmen. My children
by your diligent ouersight, and pollitique prouision to bee taught, enformed,
and instructed not onely in the sciēces liberall, verteous morall
and good literature: but also to be practised in trickes of marciall actiuitie,
and diligent exercise of prudent pollicie: For I haue hard clarkes
saie, although I am vnlettered, that fortunate is that Realme, where
Philosophiers reigne, or where kynges bee Philosophiers, and louers
of wisedome. In this tendre age, you maie writhe and turne theim, into
euery forme and fashiō: If you bryng them vp in vertue, you shall haue
verteous Princes: if you set them to learnyng, your gouernors shalbee
men of knowlege, if you teache them actiuitie, you shall haue valiaunte
capitaines, if thei practice pollicie, you shall haue bothe pollitique, and
prudent rulers. On the other side, if by your negligence, thei fall to vice
(as youth is to all euill, prone and teady) not onely their honor, but also
your honestie, shalbe spotted and appalled: If thei bee slogardes and
geuen to slothe, the publique wealth of this realme, must shortly decaye.
If thei be vnlearned, thei maie by flattery sone bee blinded, &amp; by adulacion
often deceiued. If thei lacke actiuitie, euery creature be he neuer so
base of birthe, shall foyle and ouerthrowe theim, like domme beastes
and beastly dastardes. Therfore I desire you, and in Goddes name adiure
you, rather to studie to make theim riche, in Godly knowlege, and
verteous qualities, then to take pain to glorifie theim, with abundance
of worldely treasure, and mundain superfluitie. And certainly, whē thei
come to maturitie of age, and shall peraduenture considre, that by your
omission and negligent educaciō, thei haue not suche graces, nor are endued
with suche notable qualities, as thei might haue been, if you had
performed the truste to you, by me committed: Thei shall not onely deplore,
and lament their vngarnished estate, and naked condicion, but also
it maie fortune, that thei shall conceiue inwardly against you, suche
a negligent vntruthe, that the sequele thereof, maie rather turne to displeasure
then thanke, and soner to an vngratitude, then to a rewarde.
               My kyngdom also, I leue in your gouernaunce, duryng the minoritie

of my children, chargyng you on your honors, othes, and fidelitie,
made and sworne to me, so indifferently to ordre and gouerne, the subiectes
of thesame, bothe with iustice and mercie, that the willes of malefactors,
haue not to large a scope, nor the hartes of the good people, by to
muche extremitie, bee neither sorofully daunted, nor vnkyndly kept vnder:
Oh I am so slepie, that I muste make an ende, and now before you
al I commende my soule to almightie God, my sauior and redemer: my
body to the wormes of the yearth, my kyngdom to the Prince my sonne,
and to you my louyng frendes my harte, my trust, and my whole confidence.
And euen with that, he fell on slepe: After diuerse suche charitable
monicions and exhortacions (as the pangues and fittes of his sickenes
would permit hym) sometyme to his nobilitie, sometyme to his familier
frendes, made and declared: His maladie sodainly encreased, and grewe
to so painfull an extremitie, that short death was soner of him required,
then longer life desired, wishyng rather departyng out of this worlde,
then to abide the painfull smarte, of his dolorous pangues. Wherfore
Attrapos hauyng compassion, of his continuall languishyng, and daily
agony, dirupted and brake the threde, of his naturall life, the .ix. daie
of Aprill, in the yere of our Lorde, M.CCCC.lxxxiii. and in the fiftie
yere of his bodily age, when he had reigned ouer this Realme, more in
trouble then perfecte quietnes .xxii. yeres, one monethe and eight daies:
whose corps was with funerall pompe, accordyng to the royall estate of
a kyng, conueighed to the Colege of Winsore, to the which, he had been
a greate benefactor, and there on the right hand, of the high aulter, princely
enterred and intumilate, whose death was asmuchelamented of his
subiectes, as his life desired. He begat of the Quene Elizabeth his wife,
tenne children, whereof he left liuyng twoo soonnes, Edward Prince of
Wales, and Richard duke of Yorke, and a bastard sonne called Arthur,
whiche, after was Uicount Lisle, and came to good profe: beside these he
left fiue daughters, Elizabeth, Cicilie, Anne, Katherine, and Briget: all
these wer maried, except lady Briget, whiche was a Nonne professed.
               This kyng Edward was a manne, of a goodly personage, of stature
high, and excedyng all other in countenaunce, welfauored and comly, of
iye quicke and pleasaunt, brode brested, and well set, all other members
doune to his fete, kept iust proporcion with the bulke of his body: of wit
he was quicke and pregnant, of stomacke st
                     •••
                  e and bold, &amp; of courage
haute and high, of memorie moste perfecte, and especially of suche thynges,
as he had trauailed in, in greate affaires &amp; weightie causes quicke
and diligent, in perelles and aduentures bolde and hardie, against his
enemies, fierce and terrible, to his frendes and to straungers bountifull
and liberal, hauyng in warres moste prosperous lucke, and happie successe:
From the pleasure of the body, to the whiche he was prone, &amp; much
geuen, he did muche abstein and forbere, for whiche cause, and also for
the greate humanitie and lowlines, that in hym was by nature moste
abundauntly engendered, he vsed himself emong meane persones, more

familier, then his degree, dignitie, or maiestie required, whiche was the
cause, that some suspected hym, to haue died of poyson. And it was said,
he that all the daies of his life, had muche vsed liberalitie, was towarde
his latter ende, geuen to auarice and loue of money. And although he
founde his kyngdome, greatly impouerished, and almoste emptie,
bothe of men of warre and money, yet after that he had pacified,
and finished the ciuill discencion, he left his realme,
of all thynges riche and abundaunt. The spirituall
promocions, he gaue euer to the moste famous
and excellent Clerkes, and men
of the best liuing: Other of meane
qualities, whom he muche
fauored, he did not preferre
to greate dignitie
and
high
promociōs
but with money rewarded
theim, whiche
thyng many Princes (regardyng
not their honors) do not consider
nor obserue: with all whiche notable
vertues, he ioyned to hym so surely the
hartes of his people, that after his death, his life
again was daily wisshed, and effecteously emong
his Subiectes desired, but wisshyng
serued not, nor yet their desire
tooke none effecte.

his reygne the ninthe daye of
April, in the yere of oure lord a thousande
foure hundred fourscore &amp; thre,
and in the .xxiij. yere of Lewes the leuenthe

younge prince reigned a smal space &amp;
litle season ouer this realme, either in
pleasure or libertie. For his vncle Richard
duke of Gloucester, within thre
monethes depriued hym not onely of his croune and regalitee, but also
vnnaturally bereft hym of his naturall life: and for the declaracion by
what craftie engine he firste attempted his vngraciouse purpose, &amp; by
what false coulourable and vntrue allegacions he set furth openly his
pretensed enterprise, and finally by what shamefull, cruell and detestable
act he perfourmed the same: Ye muste first considre of whom he and
his brother dessended, their natures, condicions and inclinacions, and
then you shall easely perceiue, that there coulde not bee a more crueller
tiraunt apoincted to acheue a more abhominable entreprise.
            Their father was Richard Plantagenet duke of Yorke,Richard plantagenēt duke of Yorke. whiche began
not by warre, but by lawe to calenge the crowne of Englande, puttyng
his claime in the parliament, holden the thirty yere of kyng Henry
the sixt, where either for righte or for fauoure, his cause was so set furthe
and auaunced that the bloude of the saied kynge Henry, althoughe
he had a goodly sonne, was clerely abiected, and the crowne of ye realme
(by auctoritee of parliamente) entayled to the duke of Yorke and his
heires after the decease of the sayed kynge Henry the syxte. But the
duke not entendynge so long too tary, but mindyng vnder the pretexte
of discencion growen and arisen within the realme, and of couenauntes
made in the parliamente, not kepte, but broken, to preuent the tyme and
to take vpon hym the gouernaunce in kynge Henries life, was by to
muche hardinesse slaine at the battaill of Wakefelde, leuynge behinde
hym three sonnes, Edwarde, George, and Richarde. All these three as
thei were greate estates of birthe, so were thei greate and stately of stomacke,
gredy of promocions,The iii. sōnes of Richard duke of Yorke, described. and impaciente parteuers of rule and autoritee.
            This Edward reuenged his fathers death and deposed kyng Henry

the sixt, and attained the crowne and scepter of the realme.
            George duke of Clarence was a goodly and well feautered prince, in
all thynges fortunate, if either his owne ambicion had not set hym against
his brother, or thenuy of his enemies had not set his brother againste

repented it.

entreate) was in witte and courage egall with the other, but in beautee

eiuill featured of limnes, croke backed, the left shulder muche higher
then the righte, harde fauoured of visage, such as in estates is called a
warlike visage, and emonge commen persones a crabbed face. He was
malicious, wrothfull and enuious, and as it is reported, his mother the
duches had muche a dooe in her trauaill, that she coulde not bee deliuered
of hym vncut, and that he came into the worlde the fete forwarde, as
menne bee borne outwarde, and as the fame ranne, not vntothed: whether
that menne of hatred reported aboue the truthe, or that nature
chaunged his course in his beginnynge, whiche in his life many thynges
vnnaturally committed, this I leue to God his iudgemente. He
was none euill capitain in warre, as to ye whyche, his disposicion was
more enclined too, then too peace. Sondry victories he had and some
ouerthrowes, but neuer for defaute of his owne persone, either for
lacke of hardinesse or politique order. Free he was of his dispences and
somwhat aboue his power liberall, with large giftes he gatte hym vnstedfaste
frendship: for whiche cause he was fain to borowe, pill and
extort in other places, whiche gat hym stedfaste hatred. He was close
and secrete, a depe dissimuler, lowlye of countenaunce, arrogante of
herte, outwardely familier where he inwardely hated, not lettynge to
kisse whom he thought to kill, dispiteous and cruell, not alwaie for eiuill
will, but ofter for ambicion and too serue his purpose, frende and

               e lacked not in helpynge

therof was, as menne notyng his doynges and proce
                  •
               ynges did marke
(because that he longe in kynge Edwarde his tyme thought too obtaine
the crowne in case that the kynge his brother, whose life he loked that eiuil
diet woulde sone shorten) shoulde happen to diseace, as he did in
dede, his chyldren beynge younge. And then if the duke of Clarence had
liued, his pretensed purpose had been far hyndered: For yf the duke of
Clarence had kepte hym selfe trewe to his nephewe the younge kynge, or
woulde haue taken vpon hym too bee kynge, euery one of these castes
had been a troumpe in the duke of Gloucesters waye: but when he was
sure that his brother of Clarence was ded, then he knewe that he might
worke without that ieoperdy. But of these poinctes there is no certentie▪
and whosoeuer diuineth or coniectureth, may as wel shote to fer as to
shorte, but this coniecture afterwarde toke place (as fewe dooe) as you
shall perceiue hereafter.
            But afore I declare too you howe this Richarde duke of Gloucester
began his mischeuous imagined and pretenced enterprice as apparātly
shalbee opened, I muste a litle put you in remembraunce of a louyng &amp;
charitable acte, no lesse profitable then amicable to the whole comminaltie,
if it had been so inwardely thoughte as it was ontwardly dissimuled
whiche kynge Edwarde did, liyng on his deathe bedde not longe before
he died. For in his life, although that the diuision emongest his frendes
somewhat greued and irked hym, yet in his helthe he lesse regarded &amp;
tooke hede to it, by reason that he thoughte that he was hable in al thynges
to rule bothe parties, wer thei neuer so obstinate: But in his last sickenes
(whiche continued longer then false and fantasticall tales haue
vntruely and falsely surmised, as I my selfe that wrote this pamphlet
truly knewe) when he perceiued his naturall strength was gone, and hoped
litle of recouery by the artes of all his phicisians whiche he perceiued
onely to prolonge his life. Then he began to consider the youthe of
his children, howe bee it, he nothynge lesse mistrusted then that that happened,
yet he wisely forseyng and consideryng that many harmes might
ensue by the debate of his nobles while the youth of his children should
lacke discrecion and good counsaill of their frendes, for he knewe well
that euery parte woulde woorke for their owne commodite, and rather
by plesaunte aduise to wynne theim selues fauour, then by profitable
adnertismente too dooe the chyldren good: wherefore liynge on his
deathe bed at Westminster, he called to hym suche lordes as then were
aboute hym, whome he knewe to bee at variaunce, in especiall the lorde
Marques Dorset sonne to the quene, and the lorde Hastynges, againste
whom the quene especially grudged for the fauoure that the kyng bare
hym, and also she thoughte hym familier with the kynge in wanton compaignie:
her kynne bare hym sore, aswel for that the kyng made hym capitain
of Caleis, whiche office the lord Riuers brother to the quene claimed

of the kyng his former promise, as of diuerse other giftes whiche
he receiued that they loked for. And when these lordes with diuerse
other of bothe parties were come vnto the kynge his presence, he caused
hym self to bee raised vp with pillowes, &amp; as I can gesse, saied thus
or muche like in sentence to theim.
            My lordes,An exhortaciō of kynge Edward the .iiii. in his deathe hedde. my dere kynsmen and alies, in what plight I now lye
you se, and I perfightly fele, by the whiche I loke the lesse while to liue
with you, therefore the more depely I am moued to care in what case I
leaue you, for suche as I leaue you, suche are my chyldren like to finde
you, whiche yf they should find at variaunce (as God forbid) thei theim
selfes mighte hap to fall at warre or their discrecion woulde serue to set
you at peace: you se their youthe, of whiche I reken the onely surety to
to reste in your concorde. For it suffiseth not all you too loue theim, yf
eche of you hate other: yf they were menne your faithfulnesse might hap
to suffice, but childhod muste bee maintained by mennes autoritie, and
slipper youthe vnder prompted with elder counsaill, whiche thei can neuer
haue excepte you geue it, nor you geue it, excepte you agree, for
where eche laboureth too breake that the other maketh, and for hatered
eche impugneth others counsaill: there muste nedes bee a longe tracte
or any good conclusion canne forewarde. And farther, while eache partie
laboureth too bee chiefe flatterer, adulacion shall then haue more
place▪ then plaine and faithefull aduise, of wiche muste nedes ensue the

hym) then they whiche by eiuill meanes pleased hym beste, shall after
fall fardest out of fauoure, so that at the lengthe eiuill driftes driue to
naught, and good plain waies prospere and florishe. Greate variaunce
hath been betwene you, not alwaies for greate causes: Some tyme a
thynge righte well entended and misconstured hath been turned to the
worse, or a small displeasure doen to you, either by your owne affection,
either by instigacion of euill tongues hath ben sore aggrauate. But
this I wote well▪ you had neuer so greate cause of hatred as you haue
of loue, because we bee all menne and that we bee all Christen menne.
            This I will leaue to preachers to tell you, and yet I wote not whether
any prechers woordes ought more too moue you, then I that is goyng
by and by to the place that they all preche of. But this shal I desire you
to remembre, that the one parte of you beyng of my bloude, the other of
my alies▪ and eche of you with other either of kynred or affinitee whiche
is the very spirituall affinitee and kinred in Christe, as all partakers of
the sacramentes of Christe his churche. The weighte of whiche consanguinite
yf we did beare as woulde to god we did, then shoulde we more
bee moued to spirituall charite then to fleshely consanguinitee. Our
Lorde forbid that you loue the worse together for the selfe same cause
that you oughte to loue the better, and yet that often happeneth, for no

where finde we so

                dedly debate as emongest theim whiche by nature
and lawe moste ought to agre together. Suche a serpente is ambicion
and desire of vainglory and souereingtie, which emongest estates when
he is once entred he crepith furth so far, till with deuision and variaūce
he turneth all to mischiefe. Firste longynge to be next to the beste, afterwarde
egall with the beste, and at the laste chief and aboue the beste. Of
whiche immoderate appetite of worship and the debate and discencion
that grewe there by, what losse, what sorowe, what trouble hath within
these fewe yeres growen within this realme, I pray God as well to forget
as we well remembre, whiche thynge if I coulde as well haue forsene
as I haue with my more pain then pleasure proued, by God his blessed
lady (that was his common othe) I would neuer haue won the curtesies
of mennes knees with the losse of so many heddes. But sith thynges
passed cannot bee called agayne, muche more ought wee to bee ware, by
what occasion wee haue taken so greate hurte before, that wee eftsones
fall not into that occasion again. Now bee these greues passed and al is
quiet, thanked bee God, and likely well too prospere in welthfull peace,
vnder your cosins my children, yf God sende theim life, and you loue
and concorde. Of whiche two thynges, the lesse losse were thei by whom
although God did his pleasure, yet shoulde this realme alwayes fynde
kynges, and paraduenture as good kynges as thei. But yf you emongest
your selfes in a chyldes reigne fall at debate, many a good manne
shall innocently perishe, and happely he and you also, or this land finde
peace and quiet agayne: wherefore in these laste woordes that euer I
looke to speake to you, I exhorte and require you all, for the loue that
you haue borne too me, and for the loue that I haue borne to you, and
for the loue that oure Lorde beareth to vs all: From this tyme forward
all greues forgotten, eche of you loue other, whiche I verely trust
you will, yf you any thynge regarde God or your kynges affinitee or
kynrede, this realme, your owne conntree, or your owne surete &amp; wealth.
And there with all, the kynge for fayntenesse no longer enduryng too
sitte vp, layed hym downe on his righte side, his face toward theim. And
there was none presente that coulde forbeare weepynge, but the Lordes
confortynge hym with as good wordes as thei coulde, and answerynge
for the tyme, as they thoughte shoulde stande with his pleasure. And
there in his presence (as by their woordes apeared) eche forgaue other,
and ioyned their handes together, when as it after appeared by their
dedes their hartes were far a sunder. And so whithin a fewe daies, this
noble prince disceased at Westminster the nynth daye of Aprill, in the
yere of our lorde .M.cccc.lxxxiii. after that he had reigned .xxii. yeres
one moneth and eight daies, and was with great funerall pompe conueighed
to Windsore, leuynge behynde hym twoo sonnes, Edward the
prince (of whom this story entreateth) a chylde of .xiii. yeres of age, Richard
duke of Yorke twoo yeres younger then the prince, &amp; fiue daughters,
Elizabeth, whiche by God his grace was maried to kynge Henry

the seuenthe and mother to Kynge Henry the eighte, Cicile not so fortunate
as faire, firste wedded to the vicounte Welles, after to one
Kyne and liued not in greate wealthe, Bridget professed her selfe a
close Nonne at Sion, Anne was maried to lorde Thomas Hauwarde
after erle of Surrey and duke of Northfolke, Katherine the youngest
daughter was maried to lorde William Courtney, sonne to therle
of Deuonshire, whiche long tyme tossed in either fortune, somtyme in
wealth, after in aduersite, till the benignitee of her nephewe kyng Henry
the eighte broughte her into a sure estate accordynge to her degre and
progeny.
            This kynge Edwarde was suche a prince of gouernaunce and behaueoure

within the space of .xxii. yeres, whiche is a greate parte of a mannes life,
and some were reconsiled and growen into his fauoure, of the whiche he
was neuer straunge, when it was with true herte demaunded. He was

vanquished them. He was of visage full faced &amp; louely, of body mightie,
strong and cleane made: whith ouer liberall and wanton diet, he waxed
somewhat corpulent and bourly, but neuerthelesse not vncomely.
            He was in youth greately geuen to fleshely wantonnes, from the whiche

coulde any one mannes pleasure stretche or extend to the displeasure of
very many nor a multitude bee greued by a priuate mannes fantesy or
volupteousnesse, when it was dooen withoute violence. And in his latter
daies he left all wild daliaunce, &amp; fell to grauitce, so that he brought
his realme into a wealthie and prosperous estate, all feare of outwarde
enemies were clerly extinguished, and no warre was in hande nor none
towarde, but suche as no manne looked for. The people were towarde

                  •
               ull

obedience emongeste theim selfe, and the commons were in good peace.
The lordes whom he knewe at variaunce, he in his deathe bedde (as he
thought) brought too good concorde, loue and amitee. And a litle before
his deathe, he had left gatheryng of money of his subiectes, which is the
onely thyng that draweth the hartes of Englishe menne from their kinges
and princes: nor nothyng he either enterprised nor tooke in hande,
by the whiche he shoulde bee driuen there vnto. For his tribute out of
Fraunce he had a litle before recouered and obteined. And the yere before
he died, he recouered agayn the towne of Berwike against the kyng
of Scottes. And albeit that al the tyme of his reigne, he was so benigne
courteous and familier, that no parte of his vertues was estemed more
then those highe humilitees: Yet that condicion in thende of his last daies
decaied not, in the whiche many princes by a longe continued soueraingtee,
decline to a proud porte and behaueour from their condicions
accustomed at their begynnynge. Yet lowlinesse and gentlenesse so far
furth in hym encreased that the sommer before he died, he beeynge at the
hauerynge at the bower, sente for the maire and aldermen of London
thether onely to hunte &amp; make pastyme, where he made theim not so hertye
but so familiare aud frendly chere, and sent also to their wiues suche
plenty of venison, that no one thyng in many daies before gatte hym either
mo hartes or more hertie fauour emongest the cōmon people, which
often tymes more esteme and take for greate kyndenesse a litle courtesie
then a greate profite or benefite.
            And so this noble prince deceassed, as you haue hearde in that
tyme when his life was moste desired, and when his people moste
desired to kepe hym: Whiche loue of his people and their entiere
affection towarde hym, had been to hys noble chyldren (hauynge in
theim selues also as many giftes of nature, as many princely vertues,
as muche good towardenesse as their age coulde receyue) a merucilous
fortresse and a sure armoure, yf the diuision and dissencion of their frendes
had not vnarmed theim and left theim destitute, and the execrable
desire of soueraingtie prouoked hym to their destruction, whiche yf either
kynde or kyndnesse had holden place muste nedes haue been their
chiefe defence. For Richard duke of Gloucester, by nature their vncle,
by office their protectoure, to their father greately beholden and too theim
by othe and allegeaunce bounden, all the bandes broken and violated
whiche bynde man and man together, withoute any respecte of
God or the worlde, vnnaturally contriued too bereue theim, not onely
of their dignitee and preheminence, but also of their naturall liues and
worldely felicitee.
            And first to shewe you that by coniecture he pretended this thyng in
his brothers life, ye shall vnderstande for a truth that the same nighte
that kynge Edwarde died, one called Mistelbrooke, longe ere the daye
sprōg, came to ye house of one Pottier dwellyng in Redcrosse strete without

Creple gate of London, &amp; when he was with hasty rappyng quickely
let in, the saied Mistlebroke shewed vnto Pottier that kyng Edward
was that night deceased: by my truth quod Pottier, then will my master
the duke of Gloucester bee kyng and that I warrant thee. What cause
he had so too thynke, harde it is to saie, whether he beeyng his seruaunte
knewe any suche thyng pretensed or otherwise had any ynkelyng therof
but of all likelihod he spake it not of naught.
            But now too returne to the trewe historie, wer it that the duke of
Gloucester had of old sore practised this conclusion, or was before tyme
moued there vnto and putte in hope by the tender age of the young princes
his nephewes, as oportunitee and likely of spede putteth a manne in
courage of that that he neuer entended. Certain it is, that he beeynge in
the Northe parties for the good gouernaunce of the countrye, beynge
aduertised of his brothers deathe contriued the destruction of his nephewes
with the vsurpacion of the royall dignitee and croune. And for
asmuche as he well wiste, and had holpe to maintain, a long continued
grudge and harte burning betwene the quenes kynred and the kynges
bloude, either parte enuiyng others autoritee, he now thought, as it was
in deede, a furtherly beginnynge to the pursute of his entente, and a sure
grounde and situacion of his vnnaturall buyldynge, yf he mighte vnder
the pretence of reuengynge of olde displeasures, abuse the ignoraūce
and anger of the one partie too the destruction of the other, and then to
wyn to his purpose as many as he coulde: and suche as coulde not bee
wonne, mighte bee loste or they loked therefore. But of one thynge he
was certain, that yf his entent wer once perceiued, he hould haue made
peace betwene bothe parties with his owne bloud: but all his intente he
kept secrete till he knewe his frendes, of the whiche Henry the duke of
Buckyngham was the firste that sente to hym after his brothers death
a trusty seruaunte of his called Persiuall to the citee of Yorke, where
the duke of Gloucester kepte the kynge his brothers funeralles. This
Persiuall came to Ihon Warde a secrete chamberer to the duke of
Gloucester, desirynge that he in close and couerte maner mighte speake
with the duke his master: where vpon in the ded of the nighte, the duke
sente for Persiuall (all other beeyng auoyded) whiche shewed to the
duke of Gloucester that the duke of Buckyngham his master in this
newe worlde woulde take suche parte as he woulde, and woulde farther
wayte vpon hym with a thousande good felowes yf nede were.
            The duke sente backe the messanger with greate thankes and diuerse
priuey instructions by mouthe, whiche Persiuall did somuche by his
trauaill that he came to the duke of Buckyngham his master into the
marches of Wales, and eftsones with newe instructions met with the
duke of Gloucester at Notyngham, whiche was come out of the Northecountree
with many knightes and gentlemen to the numbre of sixe
hundred horse and more, in his iourney towarde London. And after
secrete metynge and communicacion had betwene hym and the duke

of Gloucester, he returned with suche spede that he brought the duke of
Buckyngham his master too mete with the duke of Gloucester not far
from Northampton with thre hundred horsses, and so they twoo came
together too Northampton where thei first began their vnhappy enterprice,
and so the duke of Buckyngham contynued still with the duke of
Gloucester til he was crouned kyng, as ye shal plaīly perceiue herafter.
            The younge kynge at the deathe of his father kepte houshoulde at
Ludlowe, for his father had sente hym thether for Iustice too bee dooen
in the Marches of Wales, too the ende that by the autoritee of his presence,
the wilde Welshemenne and eiuell disposed personnes should refrain
from their accustomed murthers and outrages. The gouernaūce
of this younge Prince was committed too lord Antony Wooduile erle
Ryuers and lorde Scales, brother to the quene, a wise, hardy and honourable
personage, as valiaunte of handes as politique of counsaill,
and with hym were associate other of the same partie, and in effect euery
one as he was nerer of kynne vnto the quene, so was he planted nexte
aboute the prince. That drift by the quene semed too bee diuised, whereby
her bloudde mighte of righte in tender youthe bee so planted in the
princes fauoure, that afterwarde it shoulde hardely bee eradicated out
of the same.
            The duke of Gloucester turned all this to their distruction, and vpō
that grounde set the foundacion of his vnhappy buyldyng: For whom
soeuer he perceiued too bee at variaunce with theim, or to beare toward
hym selfe any fauoure, he brake vnto theim, some by mouthe, some by
writynge and secrete messengers, that it was neither reason nor yet to
be suffered that the younge kynge their master and kynsman shoulde
bee in the handes and custody of his mothers kyntede, sequestered in
maner from their compaignie and attendaunce, of whiche euery one
oughte hym as faithefull seruice as they, and many of theim of farre
more honorable parte of kynne then his mothers side, whose bloud quod
the duke of Gloucester sauyng the kyng his pleasure was farre vnmete
to bee matched with his, which now to bee remoued from the kyng and
the leaste noble to bee lefte aboute hym, is quod he neither honourable
to his maiestie nor too vs, and also too hym lesse suretie, to haue the nobles
and mightiest of his frendes from hym, &amp; to vs all no litle ieopardie
to suffre, and specially our well proued euill willers too growe into
greate autoritee with the kynge in youthe, namely whiche is lighte of
belefe and soone persuaded.
            Ye remembre that kyng Edward hym self, albeit he was bothe of age
and discrecion, yet was he ruled in many thynges by that bende, more
then stode either with his honour or our profite, or with the commoditee
of anye manne els, excepte onely the immoderate auauncemente of theim
selues, whiche whether they thirsted sore after their owne weale or no,
it were harde I thynke to gesse. And yf some folkes frendeshipe had
not holden better place with the kynge then any respecte of kynrede,

thei mighte, paraduenture, easely haue trapped and broughte to confusion
some of vs or this: and why not as easely as thei haue dooen other
or this as nere of the blud royall, but our lorde hath wroughte his will,
and thanked bee his grace that perell is paste: howebeit as greate is
growyng if we suffre this young kyng in his enemies handes, whiche
without his wittyng might abuse the name of his commaundemente to
any of our vndoyng, whiche thinges god and good prouision forbid, of
whiche good prouision none of vs hath any thynge the lesse nede for the
late attonemēte made, in which ye kyng his pleasure had more place then
the parties hertes or willes, nor none of vs is so vnwise or somuch ouersene
as to trust a newefrēd made of an old foo, or to thinke that any onely
kindenesse so sodenly contracted in an houre, continued scantly yet a
fourtnight, should bee deper set in our stomackes, then a longe accustomed
malice many yeres rooted.
            With these perswasions and writinges, the duke of Gloucester sette
a fire theim whiche were easie to kyndle, and in especiall twain, Henry
duke of Buckyngham, and Willyam lord Hastynges, and lord Chamberlain,
bothe menne of honoure and of greate power, the one by longe
succession from his aunceters, thother by his offices and the kynge his
fauoure. These two not bearyng eache to other so much loue, as hatred
both to ye quenes bloud, acc
                  •
               roed together with the duke of Gloucester
that thei would remoue from the kyng all his mothers frendes, vnder
the name of their enemies.
            Where vpon the duke of Gloucester beynge aduertised that the lordes
aboute the kynge entended to brynge hym too London too his co
               
                  •
               onacion,
accompaigned with suche a number of their frendes that it
shoulde bee harde 
                  •
               or hym too brynge his purpose to passe without the
assemblyng and gatheryng of people &amp; in maner of open warre, wherof
the ende he wyst was doubtfull, and in the which the kyng beyng on the
other syde his parte shoulde haue the name and face of rebellion.
            He secretely therefore by diuerse meanes caused the quene to be persuaded
that it was neither nede &amp; should also be ieoperdeous for ye kyng
to come vp so strong, for as now▪ euery lord loued other and none other
thyng studied for, but the triumphe of his coronation &amp; honoure of the
kyng. And the lordes about the kyng, should assemble in the kynges names
muche people, thei should geue ye lordes betwixt whom &amp; them ther
had bene some tyme bebate an occasion to feare and suspecte least they
should gather this people, not for the kynges saue gard, whom no man
impugned, but for their destruction, hauyng more regarde to their olde
variaunce then to their new attonement, for the which cause they on the
other parte might assemble men also for their defence, whose powres she
wyst wel farre 
                  ••
               retched, and thus should all the realme fal in a roare, &amp;
of the mischiefe that therof shoulde ensue (whiche was likely to be not a
lytle ye most harme was like to fal where she least woulde, &amp; then all the
world would put her &amp; her kynred in the blame, saiyng that thei had vnwysely

and vntruely broken the amytie and peace whiche the kynge her
husband had so prudently made betwene her kynred and his, whiche amyte
his kynne had alwaies obserued.
            The quene beyng thus persuaded, sent worde to the kyng and to her
brother, that there was no cause nor nede to assemble any people, &amp; also
the duke of Gloucester and other lordes of his bend, wrote vnto ye kyng
so reuerently and to the quenes frendes there so louyngly, that they nothynge
yearthly mistrustyng, brought the young kynge towarde London
with a sober compaignie in great hast (but not in good spede) til he
came to Northampton, and from thēce he remoued to Stony stratford.
On whiche day, the two dukes and their bende came to Northampton,
fainyng that Stony stratford could not lodge them al, where thei foūd
the erle Riuers, entendynge the nexte mornynge to haue folowed the
kynge, and to be with him earely in the mornyng. So that night, the dukes
made to the erle Ryuers frendly chere, but assone as they were departed
very familier with greate curtesie in open sight &amp; therle Ryuers
lodged: the two dukes with a fewe of their priuy frendes fel to councel,
wherin they spent a great parte of the night, and in the dawnynge of the
daye they sent aboute priuely to their seruauntes in their lodgynges to
hast to horsebacke for their lordes were in maner redy to ryde, whervpō
all their seruauntes were ready or the lorde Ryuers seruauntes were
awake. Nowe had the dukes taken the keyes of the ynne into their possession,
so that none shoulde yssue out withoute their consent. And ouer
this in the high way towarde Stony stratford, they set certaine of their
folkes that should cause and cōpell to retourne againe all persons that
were passyng from Northampton to Stony stratforde, saiyng that the
dukes them selfs would be the fyrst that should come to the kyng from
Northampton: thus they bare folkes in hand. But when the earle Ryuers
vnderstode the gates closed and the wayes on euery syde beset, neither
his seruauntes, neither him selfe suffered to go out, perceyuinge so
great a thynge withoute his knowlege, not begon for noughte, comparynge
this present doyng with the laste nightes chere, in so fewe houres
so greate a chaunge, marueilously myslyked it. Howebeit, syth he coulde
not get awaye▪ he determined not to kepe him selfe close, least he should
seme to hyde him selfe for some secret feare of his owne faute, wherof he
saw no such cause in him selfe, wherfore on the suretie of his owne conscience
he determined to goo to them and to inquire what this matter
might meane: Whom assone as they sawe, they beganne to quarel with
him, affirmyng that he pretended to set distaunce betwene the kyng and
them to brynge them to confusion, whiche shoulde not lye in his powre,
and when he beganne as he was an eloquente and well spoken manne
in goodlywyse to excuse hym selfe, they woulde not heare his aunswere
but toke hym by force and put hym in ward. And then they mounted on
horsbacke and came in haste to Stony stratforde, where the kynge was

goyng to horsebacke, because he would leaue the lodgyng for them, for
it was to straight for bothe the cōpaignies. And when thei came to his
presence they alighted and their compaignie aboute them, and on their
knees saluted hym, and he them gentely receiued, nothing yerthly knowyng
ner mistrustyng as yet. The duke of Buckyngham said aloude,
on afore gentlemenne, and yomen kepe your roumes, and therwith in ye
kynges presence they picked a quarel to the lord Richard Grey the quenes
sonne, and brother to the lord Marques &amp; halfe brother to the king
saiyng, that he and the Marques his brother and the lord Ryuers his
vncle had compassed to rule the kyng and the realme and set variaunce
betwene thestates, &amp; to subdue and destroy the noble bloude of the realme.
And towarde thacomplishemente of the same, they sayde, the lorde
Marques had entred into the towre of London, and thence had taken
out treasure and sent men to the sea, whiche thynges these dukes knewe
well were done for a good purpose and as very necessary, appointed by
the whole counsaill at London, but somewhat they muste saye: vnto the
whiche wordes the kynge answered, what my brother Marques hath
done I cannot saye, but in good faythe I dare well answere for mine
vncle Riuers and my brother here, that they be innocente of suche mat
               
                  •
               ers.
Yee my liege quod the duke of Buckyngham, they haue kept the
dealyng of these matters farre from the knowlege of youre good grace.
And furthwith they arrested the lorde Rychard and sir Thomas Uaugham
&amp; sir Richard Hawte knyghtes, in the kyngs presence, &amp; broughte
the kyng and all back to Northampton, where they toke further counsaill
in their affaires. And there they sent from the kyng whom it pleased
them, &amp; set aboute him suche seruauntes as better pleased them then
him. At which dealyng he wepte and was not content, but it booted not.
And at dynner, the duke of Glocester sent a dyshe from his owne table
to the lord Ryuers, praiyng him to bee of good chere and all shoulde be
well, he thanked him &amp; prayed the messenger to beare it to his nephiewe
the lorde Richard with like wordes, whom he knewe to haue nede of cō
               fort,
as one to whom suche aduersite was straunge, but he hym selfe had
bene all his daies ennured therwith, and therfore could beare it the better.
But for al this message, the duke of Gloucester sent ye lorde Ryuers,
the lord Richard and sir Thomas Uaugham and sir Richarde Hawte
into the Northparties into diuerse prisones, but at last, al came to Poū
               fret
where they all foure were beheaded without iudgement.
            In this maner as you haue hard, the duke of Gloucester toke on him
the gouernaunce of the yonge kyng, whom with much reuerence he conu
                  •
               ied
towardes London. These tidynges came hastely to the quene before
mydnighte, by a very sore reporte that the kynge her sonne was taken
and that her brother and her other sonne and other her frendes were
arested and sent, no man wyste whether. With this heauy tidynges the
quene bewayled her chyldes ruyne, her frendes mischaunce, and her
owne infortune, curffyng the tyme that euer she was persuaded to leaue

the gatherynge of people to brynge vp the kynge with a greate powre,
but that was passed, and therfore nowe she toke her younger sonne the
duke of Yorke and her doughters and went out of the palays of Westminster
into the sanctuary, and there lodged in the abbotes place, and
she and all her chyldren and compaignie were regestred for sanctuarye
persons. The same night there came to doctor Rotheram Archebyshop
of Yorke and lorde Chauncelour, a messenger from the lorde Chambrelayne
to Yorke place besyde Westminster: the messenger was broughte
to the bishoppes bedsyde and declared to him that the dukes were gone
backe with the young kyng to Northampton, and declared further▪ that
the lorde Hastynges his maister sent hym worde that he shoulde feare
nothyng for all should be well. (Wel quod the Archebishop) be it as wel
as it wyl, it wyll neuer be so wel as we haue sene it, and then the messenger
departed. Wherupon the bishop called vp all his seruauntes and
toke with hym the great seale and came before day to the quene, aboute
whom he round much heuynesse, rumble, haste, busynesse, conueighaunce
and cariage of hir stuffe into sanctuarye, euery man was busy to carye,
beare and conueigh stuffe, chestes &amp; fardelles, no man was vnoccupied,
and some caried more then they were commaunded to another place.
            The quene sat alone belowe on the rushes all desolate &amp; dismayde, whō
the Archebishoppe conforted in the best maner that he coulde, shewyng
her that the matter was nothyng so sore as she tooke it for, and that he
was putte in good hope and out of feare by the message sent to hym
from the lorde Hastynges. A wo worth hym quod the quene, for it is he
that goeth about to destroy me and my blodde. Madame quod he be of
good comforte and I assure you, yf they crowne any other kynge then
your sonne whom they nowe haue, we shal on the morow croune his brother
whom you haue here with you. And here is the great seale▪ which in
likewyse as your noble husband deliuered it to me, so I deliuer it to you
to the vse of your sonne and therwith deliuered her the greate seale, and
departed home in the dawning of the day. And when he opened his wyndowes
and loked on the Temys, he might see the riuer full of boates, of
the duke of Gloucester his seruauntes watchyng, that no person should
go to sanctuary, ner none should passe vnserched.
            Then was there greate rumoure and commotion in the citee and in
other places, the people diuersely diuined vpon this dealynge. And diuerse
lordes, knightes and gentilmen, either for fauoute of the quene or
for feare of them selfes, assembled compaignies and wente flockyng together
in harneies. And many also, for that they recompted this demeanour
attempted, not so specially against other lordes as against the
kynge hym selfe in the dysturbaunce of his coronacion, therefore they
assembled by and by together to common of this matter at London.
            The Archebishoppe of Yorke fearinge that it woulde be ascribed (as it
was in dede) to ouermuch lightnes, that he so sodeinly had yelded vp the
great seale to the quene, to whō the custody therof nothing apperteigned

withoute especial commaundemente of the kynge, secretely sente for the
seale againe and broughte it with hym after the accustomed maner to
mete with the lordes.
            At this metynge, the lorde Hastynges, whose trueth towarde the
kyng no manne doubted nor neded not to doubte, persuaded the lordes
to beleue, that the duke of Gloucester was faithefull and sure towardes
his prince, and that the lord Ryuers, the lorde Richard and other knightes
apprehended, were for matters attempted by them against the dukes
of Gloucester and Buckyngham put vnder arest, for their suretie, and
not for the kynges ieopardie, and that they were also in sauegarde there
to remayne tyll the matter were (not by the dukes onely) but also by all
the other lordes of the kynges councell indifferently examined, and by
their discrecions ordred and either iudged or appesed. And one thynge
he auised them to beware of, that they iudged not the matter to farfurthe
or they knewe the trueth, nor turnynge their priuate grudges
into the common hurte, irritynge and prouokynge men vnto angre,
and disturbyng the kynges coronacion, towarde which the dukes were
commynge, for that, then mighte paraduenture brynge the matter so
farre oute of ioynte, that it shoulde neuer be brought in frame againe,
whiche yf it shoulde happe as it were likely to come to a felde, though al
parties were in all other thynges egual, yet shoulde the authorytee bee
on that syde, where the kynge is hym selfe, with these persuasions of the
lorde Hastynges, whereof parte he hym selfe beleued, and of parte he
wyst well the cōtrary, these commocions were some what appeased. But
in especiall, because the dukes of Buckyngham and Gloucester were so
nere and came on so shortely with the kynge, in none other maner, nor
none other voice or sembleaunce then to his coronaciō
               ▪ causyng the fame
to be blowen aboute that suche persons as were apprehended had contriued
the distruction of the dukes of Gloucester and of Buckyngham
and other of the noble bloude of this realme, to the entente that they alone
woulde rule and gouerne the kynge. And for the coloure thereof,
suche of the dukes seruauntes as rode with the cartes of their stuffe
whiche were taken, among the whiche stuffe no marueyle though some
were harneyes whiche at the breakynge vp of suche an housholde muste
be broughte awaye or caste awaye, they shewed to the people, and as
they went, sayd: lo, here be the barrelles of harneyes that these traitours
had priuelye conueighed in their cariages to destroye the noble lordes
withal. This diuerse, (although it made the matter to wyse men more
vnlikely) wel perceiuyng that thentendours of suche a purpose woulde
rather haue had their harneyes on their backes, then to haue boūd them
vp in barrelles, yet muche parte of the common people were therewith
right well satisfied.
            When the kynge approched nere the cytee,
                  
                     〈…〉
                   of London. Edmonde Shawe
Goldesmythe then Mayre of the cytie with the Aldermenne and shreues
in skarlet, and fyue hundreth commoners in murraye receyued

his grace reuerently at Harnesay Parke, and so conueighed him to the
cytee, where he entred the fourth day of May, in the fyrst and last yere of
his reigne, and was lodged in the bishoppe of Londons Palayce: but ye
duke of Gloucester bare him in open sight so reuerently, saiyng to al mē
as he rode, behold your prince and souereigne lord, and made suche sembleaunce
of lowlynes to his prince, that from the greate obloquy that he
was in so late before he was sodenly fallen in so greate trust that at the
councel next assembled, he was made the onely chiefe ruler, and thought
most mete to be protectoure of the kynge and his realme: so that, were it
desteny or were it foly, the lambe was betaken to the wolfe to kepe. At
whiche councell the Archebishop of Yorke was sore blamed for deliueryng
the great seale to the quene, and the seale taken from him and deliuered
to doctor Iohn Russel bishop of Lyncolne, a wyse mā and a good
and of much experience, and diuerse lordes and knyghtes were appointed
to diuerse roumes, the lorde Chamberlayne and some other kept the

                  •
               oumes that they were in before, but not many.
            Nowe were it so that the protectour (whiche alwayes you must take
for the duke of Gloucester) sore thristed for the acheuynge of his pretensed
entrepryse and thought euery daye a yeare tyll it were perfourmed,
yet durste he no further attempte as long as he had but half his pray in
his hand, well wittyng that yf he deposed the one brother, all the realme
woulde fall to the other, yf he remayned either in sanctuarye or shoulde
happely be shortly conueighed to his fathers libertie. Wherfore incontinent
at the nexte metynge of the lordes in councel, he purposed to them
that it was an heynous thyng of the quene, and procedyng of great malice
toward the kynges councelers that she should kepe the kynges brother
in sanctuarye from him whose speciall pleasure and comforte were
to haue his brother with him, and that to be done by her to none other intente,
but to brynge all the lordes in an obloquy and murmoure of the
people, as though they were not to be trusted with the kynges brother,
whiche lordes were by the whole assente of the nobles of the realme appointed
as the kynges nere frendes to the tuycion of his royall person,
the prosperitee wherof (quod he) standeth not alonely in kepynge from
enemies and euill dyate, but partely also in recreacion &amp; moderate pleasure,
whiche he cannot take in his tendre youth in the compaignye of old
and auncient persons, but in the familiare conuersacion of those that be
not far vnder nor farre aboue his age, and neuerthelesse, of estate conueniente
to accompany his maiestie, wherfore with whom rather then with
his owne brother? and yf any man thynke this consideracion lighte (I
thynke no man so thynketh that loueth the kynge) let hym consider that
somtyme without smal thynges, greater cannot stande, and verely it redouneth
greatly to the dishonoure of the kynges highnes and of all vs
that be about his grace to haue it come in any mans mouthe, not in this
realme onely, but also in other landes (as euill wordes walke far) that ye
kynges brother should be fayne to kepe sanctuary. For euery man wyll

iudge that no man wyll so do for nought, and suche opinions fastened in
mens hartes be harde to be wrested out, and maye growe to more griete
then any man here can diuine. Wherfore me thinketh it were not ye worst
to send to the quene some honourable and trustie personage, such as ten
dreth the kynges weale and the honour of his coūcell, and is also in credite
and fauoure with her: for whiche consideracions none femeth more
metely to me then the reuerende father my lorde Cardinall archebishop
of Cauntorbury, who may in this matter do moste good of all men yf it
please him to take the payne, whiche I doubt not of his goodnes he will
not refuse for the kynges sake and ours and wealth of the younge duke
hym selfe the kynges most honorable brother, and for the conforte of my
souereigne lorde hym selfe my most dearest nephiewe, consideryng that
therby shalbe ceassed the 
                  •
               launderous rumore and obloquy nowe going
abrode, and the hurtes auoyded that therof might ensue, and then must
rest and quietnesse growe to all the realme. And yf she percase be so obstinate
and so precisely set in her owne wyll and opinion, that neither his
wyse and faithfull aduertisemente can moue her, nor any mans reason
satisfye her, then shall we by myne aduice by the kynges authorytee fetche
hym oute of that prison and brynge hym to his noble presence, in
whose continuall compaignye he shalbee so well cheryshed and so honorably
intreated that all the worlde shall to our honour and her reproche
perceiue that it was onely malice, frowardnesse and foly, that caused her
to kepe him there. This is my mynd for this tyme, except that any of you
my lordes any thyng perceyue to the contrari, for neuer shal I by Gods
grace so wed my self vnto myne owne wil, but I shalbe ready to chaūge
it vpon your better aduices.
            When the Protectour had sayde, all the councell affirmed that the
mocion was good and reasonable, and to the kyng and the duke his brother
honourable, and a thyng that should ceasse great murmoure in the
realme, yf the mother might by good meanes be induced to delyuer him:
whiche thynge the Archebishop of Cauntorburye, whom they all agreed
also to be moost conuenient therunto, tooke vpon hym to moue her, and
therto to do his vttermooste endeuoure. Howebeit yf she coulde in no
wyse be intreated with her good wyll to delyuer hym, then thought he
and such of the spiritualtie as were present, that it were not in any wyse
too bee attempted to take hym out againste her wyll, for it woulde be a
thyng that should turne to the grudge of all men and highe displeasure
of God, yf the pryuilege of that place shoulde be broken whiche had so
many yeres bene kepte, whiche bothe Kynges and Popes had graunted
and confirmed, which ground was sanctifyed by Sainct Peter himselfe
more then fyue hundreth yeres agone. And syth that tyme, was neuer
so vndeuoute a kynge that euer enterprised that sacred priuilege to
violate, nor so holy a byshop that durste presume the church of the same
to consecrate: and therefore quod the Archebishop, God forbyd that any
manne shoulde for any yearthely enterprise breake the immunyte and

libertie of that sacred sanctuary that hath bene the safegard of so many
a good mans life, but I trust quod he, we shall not nede it, but for any
maner of nede I would we should not do it, I trust that she with reason
shalbe contented and all thynge in good maner obteined. And yf it hap
that I brynge it not to passe, yet shall I further it to my best power, so
that you all shal perceyue my good wyll, diligence, and indeuoure: But
the mothers dreade and womannishe feare shalbe the let yf any be.
            Naye womannishe frowardnesse quod the duke of Buckyngham, for
I dare take it on my solle that she well knoweth that she nedeth no such
thynge to feare, either for her sonne or for her self. For as for her, here is
no man that wyll be at warre with women, would God some men of her
kynne were women to, and then should all be sone in rest. Howbeit, there
is none of her kynne the lesse loued for that they be of her kynne, but for
their awne euill deseruynge. And put the case that we neither loued her
nor her kynne, yet there were no cause why we shoulde hate the kynges
noble brother to whose grace we oure selfes be kynne, whose honoure yf
she desired as our dishonoure, and as muche regarde toke to his wealth
as to her awne wyll, she coulde be as loth to suffre him to be absent from
the kyng as any of vs, yf she had any wytte, as woulde God she had as
good wyll as she hath frowarde wytte. For she thinketh her selfe no wyser
then some that are here, of whose faithful myndes she nothing doubteth,
but verely beleueth and knowlegeth that they woulde be as sorye
of his harme as her awne selfe, and yet they would haue him from her if
she abyde there.
            And we all I thynke be content that bothe her chyldren be with her if
she came from thence and abyde in suche place where they may be with
their honoure. Nowe yf she refuse in the deliueraunce of hym to folowe
the wysedome of them, whose wysedome she knoweth, whose approbate
fidelitee she well trusteth: it is easye to percewe that frowardenesse letteth
her, and not feare. But goo to, suppose that she feareth (as who may
let her to feare her awne shadowe) the more we oughte to feare to leaue
hym in her handes, for yf she cast suche fonde doubtes that she feare his
hurte, then wyll she feare that he shall be fet thence, for she wyll soone
thynke that yf men were set (whiche God forbyd on so great a mischiefe)
the sanctuary wyl litle let them, whiche sanctuary good men as me thinketh
might without synne, somewhat lesse regard then they do. Nowe
then, if she doubt least he might be fetched from her, is it not likely that
she wyl sende hym somewhere out of the realme? verely I loke for none
other. And I doubt not but she nowe as sore myndeth it, as we mynde
the set therof: And if she might hap to brynge that purpose to passe, as it
were no great mastery to do, we lettyng her alone, all the worlde would
say that we were a sorte of wyse coūsaillers about a kyng to let his brother
to be 
                  •
               ast away vnder oure noses. And therfore I ensure you faithfully,
for my mynde, I wyll rather maugre her stomacke fetche hym awaye,
then leaue him there till her feare or fonde frowarde feare conuey

him away,Of sanctuaries and yet will I breake no sanctuary, for verely sithe the priuelege
of that place and other of that sorte haue so lōg continued I would
not goo aboute to breake it, but yf thei were nowe to begynne I woulde
not be he that should make them: yet wyl not I say nay, but it is a deede
of pitie that such men as the chaūce of the sea, or their euill debters haue
brought into pouertee, should haue some place of refuge to kepe in their
bodies out of the daunger of their cruel creditours. And if it fortune the
croune to come in question as it hath done before this tyme whyle eche
parte taketh other for traytours, I thynke it necessarye to haue a place
or refuge for bothe: But as for theues and murtherers, wherof these places
be full, and whiche neuer falle from their crafte after they once falle
therunto, it is pytee that euer Sanctuary should serue them, and in especiall
wylfull murtherers, whom God commaundeth to be taken from
the aulter and to be put to death. And where it is otherwyse then in these
cases, there is no nede of sainctuaries, apointed by God in the olde lawe.
For yf necessite of his owne defence or misfortune driued hym to that
deede, then a pardon serueth him, which either is graunted of course, or ye
kyng of pytee and compassion geueth. Nowe loke howe fewe sainctuary
menne there be whom necessitee or misfortune compelled to go thether?
And then see on the other syd, what a sorte there be commonely therein of
suche, whom wylfull vnthrittynes hath brought to naught? what a rable
of theues, murtherers and malicious heynous traitours be▪ and that
in twoo places specially, the one at the elbowe of the cytee, and the other
in the very bowels. I dare well a vowe it, yf you way the good that they
do▪ with the hurte that commeth of them, ye shall fynde it muche better
to lese bothe then to haue bothe. And this I saye, although they were not
abused (as they nowe be and so longe haue bene) that I feare me euer
they wyll be whyle men be afearde to set to their handes to the amendemente,
as though God and saincte Peter were the patrons of vngracious
liuynge. Nowe vnthriftes riote and ronne in debte vpon boldnes
of these places, yea, and ritche menne ronne thyther with poore mens
goodes, there they buylde, there they spende and byd their creditours
goo whystle. Mens wyues ronne thither with their husbandes plate,
and saye they dare not abyde with their husbandes for betynge, theues
brynge thither stollen goodes and lyue theron. There deuyse they newe
robberies nightely and steale oute and robbe, riue, and kyll menne and
come agayne into those places, as though those places gaue theim not
onely a sauegard for the harme that they haue dooen, but a licence also
to do more mischiefe: howebeit, muche of this greate abusion, (yf wyse
menne woulde sette their handes there vnto) mighte bee amended, with
greate thankes of God and no breche of the priuilege. The conclusion
is, sithe it is so long a goo I wote not what pope and what prince, more
piteous then politique, hath graunted it, and other menne sence of a religious
feare haue not broken it, lette vs take a paine with it, and lette
it stande a Goddes name in his force, as far furthe as reason will,

whiche is not so farfurthe as maye serue too lette vs of the fetchynge
furthe of this noble manne to his honoure and wealthe out of that place
in the whiche he nether is nor can bee a sanctuarye or priuileged man. A
sanctnarye euer sernethe too defende the bodye of that manne that standeth
in daunger abrode, not of greate hurte onely, but of lawfull hurte:
for againste vnlawfull hurtes and harmes no pope ner kynge entended
too priuilege any one place wherein it is lawefull for one manne
to doo another manne wronge. That no manne vnlawefully take hurte
that libertie the kynge, the lawe and verie nature fordiddeth in euerye
place and maketh too that regarde for euery manne euery place a sanctuarye
but where a manne is by lawefull meanes in perell, there nedeth
he the tuicion of some speciall priuilege, whiche is the onely grounde
of all sanctuaries, from whiche necessitee this noble prince is farre,
whose loue to his kynge nature and kynred proueth, whose innocencie
too all the worlde, his tender youthe affirmeth, and so sanctuarye as for
hym is not necessary, ner none he can haue. Menne come not too sanctuarye
as they come too babtisme to require it by his godfathers he
muste aske it hym selfe that muste haue it, and reason, sithe no manne
hath cause too haue it, but whose consience of his awne faute maketh
hym haue nede to require it. What will then hath younder babe▪ which
yf he had discreccion too require it yf nede were, I dare saye woulde bee
nowe righte angry with theim that kepe hym there? And I woulde
thinke withoute any scruple of consience, withoute any breche of priuilege
too bee somewhat more homely with theim that bee there sanctuarye
menne in deede, that yf one goo too sanctuary with another mannes
goodes, why shoulde not the kyng leuyng his body at liberty satisfy the
party of his goodes euen within the sanctuary, for nether king nor pope
can geue any place such a priuilege that it shall discharge a man of his
debtes beeyng hable to paie.
            And with that 
                  •
               iuerse of the clergie that were there presente, whether
they saied it for his pleasure or as they thoughte, agreed plainly by the
lawe of God and of the churche that the goodes of a sanctuarye man
should be deliuered in paiment of his debtes, and stollen goodes to the
owner, and onely libertie reserued to hym too get his liuyng with the labour
of his handes. Uerely quod the duke I thynke ye saye very truth:
And what yf a mannes wife take sanctuary because she list to ronne frō
her husband? I would thynke yf she can allege none other cause he may
laufully without any displeasure dooen too sainct Peter, take her out of
saincte Peters churche by the arme. And yf no body maie be taken out
of sanctuary because he saieth he will abide there, then yf a chylde will
take sanctuary because he feareth to go to schoole, his master must lette
hym alone. And as simple as that example is, yet is there lesse reason in
our case then in it, for there, though it bee a childeshe feare, yet is there at
the leaste some feare, and herein is no feare at all. And verely I
haue harde of sanctuarye menne, but I neuer harde before of sanctuary

children, and therefore as for the conclusion of my mynde, whosoeuer
maie deserue to haue nede of it, if thei thynke it for their suretee let theim
kepe it, but he can be no sanctuary manne that hath nother discresion to
desire it, ner malice to deserue it, whose life ner libertie can by no lawfull
processe stande in ieoperdye: and he that taketh one out of sanctuarye to
dooe hym good I saie plainly he breaketh no sanctuary.
            When the duke had doen, the temporal menne wholy, and the moste
parte of the spirituall menne also thynkynge no hurte earthely ment toward
the younge baby, condiscended in effecte, that yf he wer not deliuered
he shoulde bee fetched oute. Howebeit, they thoughte it beste in aduoydyng
of all maner of rumour, that the cardinall shoulde firste assaie
to get hym with her good will. And thervpon all the counsaill came to ye
sterre chamber at Westminster, and the cardinal leauing the protectour
and other lordes in the sterre chamber departed into the sanctuarye to ye
quene, accompaignied with certain lordes, were it for the respecte of hys
honoure or that she shoulde by the persones of so many, perceiue that his
arrande was not onely one mannes mynde, or wer it for that the protectour
entended not in this matter too truste one manne alone, or els if she
finally were determined to kepe hym, some of the cōpaignie had paraduenture
some secrete instruction incontinente maugree her will too take
hym and too leaue her no respite to conueigh hym.
            When the quene and these lordes were come together in presence, the
Cardinall shewed vnto her that it was thought to the lorde protectour
and the whole counsaill that her kepyng of the kyng his brother in that
place highly sounded, not onely to the grudge of the people &amp; their obloquy,
but also to the importable grief and displeasure of the kynge his
royall maiestye, to whose grace it were a synguler comforte to haue his
naturall brother in compaignie, and it was their bothes dishonoures &amp;
theirs and hers also to suffre hym in sanctuary, as though the one brother
stode in danger and perell of the other. And he shewed her farther
that the whole counsaill had sente hym to require of her the deliuerye of
him that he might bee brought to the king his presence at his libertie out
of that place whiche menne reconed as a prisone, and there should he be
demeaned according to his estate and degree, &amp; she in this doyng should
bothe dooe great good to the realme, pleasure to the counsaill, profite to
her self, succour to her frendes that wer in distresse, and ouer that, which
he wiste well she specially tendered, not onely greate comforte and honoure
to the kynge but also to the younge duke hym selfe, whose bothe
greate wealth it were to bee together, aswell for many greater causes as
also for their bothe disporte and recreacion, whiche thynges the lordes
estemed not lighte, though it semed lighte, well ponderynge that their
youthe without recreacion and plaie cannot endure, ner any estraunger
for the conuenience of both their ages &amp; estates so metely in that poinct
for any of them as the either of them for thother.
            My lord (quod the quene,) I saie not naie, but that it wer very conueniente

that this gentleman whom you require were in the compaignie of
the kyng his brother, and in good faith me thynketh it wer as great commoditee
to theim bothe, as for yet a while too bee in the custody of their
mother the tendre age considered of the elder of theim bothe, but in especiall
the younger, whiche besides his infancie that also nedeth good lookynge
to, hath a while been so sore deseased with sickenes and is so newlye
rather a litle amended then well recouered, that I dare putte no persone
earthely in truste with his kepyng, but my selfe onely, consideryng
there is as phisicians saie, and as we also finde, double the perell in the
resiluacion that was in the firste sickenes, with whiche desease nature
beeyng sore laboured, foreweried and weakened, waxeth the lesse hable
to beare our a newe surfet. And albeit there might bee foundē other that
woulde happely doo their beste vnto hym, yet is there none that either
knoweth better howe to ordre hym then I, that so longe haue kepte him,
or is more tendrely like too cherishe hym then his owne mother that
bare hym. No man denieth good madame, quod the Cardinall, but that
your grace of all folke wer moste necessarie aboute your chyldren, and
so woulde all the counsaill not onely bee contente but also glad that it
were if it might stand with your pleasure too bee in such place as might
stande with their honoure. But yf you apoincte your selfe too tary here,
then thynke they it more cōuenient the duke of yorke wer with the kinge
honorably at his libertie to the comforte of theim bothe, then here as a
sanctuary man to their bothe dishonoure and obloquy, sith there is not
alway so great necessite to haue the child with the mother, but that occasion
sometyme maie bee suche that it shoulde bee more expedient to kepe
hym els where, whiche in this well apereth, that at suche tyme that your
moste derest sonne then prince and now kyng shoulde for his honor and
good ordre of the countree kepe houshoulde in Wales far out of your
kepyng, your grace was well content therewith your self. Not very wel
content (quod the quene) &amp; yet the case is not like, for the one was then in
health and theother is now sicke, in which case I maruaill greately why
my lorde protectour is to desirous to haue hym in kepyng, where if the
child in his sickenesse miscaried by nature, yet might he ronne into slauuder
&amp; suspicion of fraud. And they call it a thyng so sore against my childes
honour &amp; theirs also ye he abideth in this place, it is all their honoures
there to suffre hym abyde where no mā doubteth he shalbe best kept,
&amp; that is here while I am here, which as yet entende not to come furthe &amp;
ieoperde my self after other of my frendes, whiche woulde God wer rather
here in suretee with me, then I were there in ieoperdie with theim.
            Why madame (quod the lord Haward) knowe you any thyng why they
should bee in ieopardie? Nay verely (quod she,) nor why thei should bee
in prisone neither as thei nowe bee, but I trowe it is no greate marueill
though I feare least those that haue not letted to put theim in duraunce
withoute coloure, will let as litle to procure their distruction withoute
cause. The cardinall made a countenaunce to the lord Haward that he

should harpe no more vpon that stryng: and then saied he too the quene,
that he nothyng doubted but those lordes of her kynne the whiche remained
vnder a reste should vpon the matter examined doo well ynough, &amp;
as towarde her noble persone, neither was, nor coulde bee any maner of
ieoperdie. Whereby shoulde I truste that (quod the quene) in that I am
gyltesse, as though thei were gyltie, in that I am with their enemies better
beloued then they, when they hate theim for my sake, in that I am so
nere to the kynge, and howe farre bee they of that woulde helpe, as God
sende grace they hurte not. And therefore as yet I purpose not too departe
hence: as for this gentleman my sonne, I mynde he shal bee where
I am till I see further, for I see some men so gredy withoute any substanciall
cause too haue hym, whiche maketh me much more further and
scrupulous too deliuer hym. Truely madame (quod the Cardinall) the
further that ye bee too deliuer hym, the further bee other menne too suffre
you too kepe hym, leaste your causelesse feare, mighte cause you farther
too conueighe hym, and many thynke he can here haue no priuilege
whiche can haue neither will too aske it, nor yet malice or offence to nede
it. And therefore, they recon no priuilege broken, although they fetche
hym out of sanctuarie, whiche yf you finally refuse too deliuer hym. I
thynke verely the counsaill will enfraunchefe hym, so muche dread hath
my lorde his vncle, for the tendre loue that he beareth hym, leaste your
grace shoulde sende hym awaye. Ah, quod the quene, hath he so tendre a
zeale too hym that he feareth nothynge, but leaste he should escape hym?
Thynketh he that I would send hym hēce, which is neither in the plight
to sende out? and in what place could I recon hym sure, yf he be not sure
in this sanctuary? wherof was there neuer tiraunte yet so deuelishe, that
durste attempt too breake the priuilege, &amp; I trust God is now as strong
to withstand his aduersaries as euer he was. But my sonne can deserue
no sanctuary, you saye, and therefore he can not haue it, forsothe the lord
protectour hath sent a goodly glose, by the whiche that place that maye
defende a thefe, maie not saue an innocent: but he is in no ieoperdie nor
hath no nede therof, I would God he had not. Troweth the protectour,
(I pray God he maie proue a protectour, rather then a destroyer, where
vnto his painted processe draweth) y• is it not honourable that the duke
byde here? it were more confortable to theim bothe that he were with his
brother, because the kyng lacketh a plaie feloe, yea be you sure, I praye
God send hym better plai felowes then hym that maketh so high a matter
vpon such a trifleyng pretexte, as though there could none bee found
to plaie with the kyng, but if his brother which hath no luste to plaie 
                  •
               or
sickenesse, must come out of sanctuary, out of his sauegard to plaie with
hym, as though that princes so young as thei bee, could not plaie without
their peeres, or children coulde not playe without their kynred, with
whom for the more parte they agree much worse then with straungiers.
But the chylde you saie cannot require the priuilege, who tolde the protectour
so? Aske hym and you shall here hym aske it, and so shall he yf ye

will. Howebeit, this is a straunge matter, suppose he coulde not aske it &amp;
thynke he would not aske it, and imagene he would aske to goo out, if I
saye he shal not: Note yf I aske the priuilege, but for my self, I say that
he that againste my will taketh out hym, breaketh sanctuarie. Serueth
this libertie for my persone onely or for my goodes to? you maie not frō
hence take my horsse from me, yf I stale hym not nor owe you nothyng:
then foloweth it, that you maye not take my child from me▪ he is also my
ward, for as farre as my learned counsaill sheweth me, he hath nothyng
by dissente holden by knightes seruyce, but by socage: then the lawe maketh
me his guarden, then maye no manne lawfully (I suppose) take my
warde from me out of this place▪ without the breche of sanctuary, and if
my priuilege coulde not serue hym, nor he aske it for hym self, yet sith the
lawe committeth to me the custodye of hym, I maye require it for hym,
excepte the lawe geue the infaunte a guarden onely for his goodes, dischargynge
hym of the cure and sauekepyng of his body, for which onely,
bothe goodes and landes serue: Wherefore here entende I to kepe
hym, sithe mannes lawe serueth the guarden too kepe the infante, and
the lawe of nature willeth the mother to kepe the chyld, and Goddes law
priuilegeth the sanctuary, and the sanctuarye priuilegeth my sonne, sith
I feare to put hym to the protectoures handes, that hath his brother
already, whiche is (yf bothe failed) inheritoure to the crowne as heire
male, as he saythe. The cause of my feare no manne hath too doo to
examine, and yet feare I no ferther then the lawe feareth, whiche as
learned menne tell me, forbiddeth euery manne the custodye of theim,
by whose death he maie enherite lesse lande then a kyngdome. I can saie
no more, but whosoeuer he bee that breaketh this holy 
                  •
               anctuary, I prai
God sende hym shortely nede of sanctuary, when he maye not come too
it, for I woulde not that my mortall enemie shoulde bee taken oute of
sanctuary.
            The Cardinall perceiued that the quene euer the longer the farther
of, and also that she began too kyndle and chafe and spake sore bytynge
woordes againste the protectoure, and suche as he neither beleued and
also was loth to here, he saied to her, for a finall cōclusion, that he would
no more dispute the matter, and yf she were contente to deliuer the duke
to hym and to the other lordes there presente, he durste laie his owne body
and solle bothe in pledge, not onely for his suretye, but also for his
estate, and surely he knewe nor suspected no cause but he mighte so dooe
(but he knewe not all.) And further he saied, if she woulde geue hym a
resolute aunswere too the contrary he would therewith departe incontinente,
and shifte who so woulde with this businesse afterwarde, for he
neuer entended further to moue her in the matter, in the whiche she
thoughte that he and all other also, saue her selfe, lacked either witte or
trueth. Witte yf they wer so dull yf they nothynge coulde perceiue what
the protector entended, and yf they should procure her sonne to bee deliuered
into his handes, in whom thei should perceiue towardes the child

any euyll will entended, then she mighte thynke all the counsaill bothe
euill aduised and of litle fidelitee to their prince.
            The quene with these woordes stode in a greate study, and forasmuch
as she sawe the lorde Cardinall more redier to departe then the remanaunte,
and the protectoure hym selfe redy at hande, so that she verely
thought that she could not kepe him there but he should bee incontinente
taken thence and to conueigh hym els where, neither had she tyme too
serue her, nor place determined, nor persones appointed to conueigh
hym, and so all thyng was vnredy, when this messsage came so sodainly
on her▪ nothyng lesse lookynge for, then too haue hym out of sanctuarye
which she knewe now menne too be sette in al places about, that he could
not bee conueighed out vntaken, and partely as she thoughte it mighte
fortune her feare to bee false: so well she wiste it was either nedelesse or
bootelesse. Wherefore, yf she shoulde nedes goo from hym, she demed
beste to deliuer hym, and specially of the cardinalles faithe she nothyng
doubtyng nor of some other lordes whom she sawe there, whiche as she
feared le
                  •
               e, they mighte bee deceiued, so well was she assured that they
woulde not bee corrupted: then thought she that it would make theim y•
more warely too loke to hym, and the more circumspectely to see his surety,
yf she with her owne handes betooke hym them by truste, and at the
laste she toke the young duke by the hand and saied vnto the lordes, my
lorde quod she and all my lordes, neither am I so vnwyse to mystruste
your wittes, nor so suspicious to mistruste your truthes: of the whyche
thyng I purpose to make suche a proofe, that if either of bothe lacked in
you, might turne bothe me to greate sorowe, the realme to muche harme
and you to great reproche. For lo, here is quod she this gentlemā, whom
I doubt not but I coulde kepe safe if I would, whatsoeuer any manne
saie, and I doubte not also but there bee some abroade so dedly enemies
vnto my bloud, that yf they wiste wher any of it laye in their owne body
they would lette it out: we haue also experiēce that the desire of a kyngdome
knoweth no kynrede, the brother hath been the brothers bane, and
maie the nephewes bee sure of the vncle? eche of these children are others
defence while thei bee a sunder, and eche of their liues lieth in others body
kepe one safe and bothe be sure, and nothyng to bothe more perilous
then bothe too bee in one place: for a wise marchaunte neuer auentureth
al his gooddes in one ship. Al this notwithstandyng▪ here I deliuer him
and his brother in hym, to kepe to your handes, of whome I shall aske
theim bothe before God and the worlde. Faithefull you bee and that I
wote well, and I knowe you bee wise and of power and strength yf you
liste to kepe hym, for you lacke no helpe of your selues, nor nede to lacke
no helpe in this case, and yf you cannot els where, then maye yon leaue
hym here: But onely one thyng I beseche you, for the truste that his father
putte you in euer, and for the truste that I putte you in now, that
as farre as you thynke that I feare to muche▪ ye bee well ware that you
feare not to litle. And therewith all she saied to the chyld, fare well myne

awne swete sonne, God sende you good kepyng, let me once kisse you or
you go, for God knoweth whē we shal kisse together agayn, &amp; therewith
she kyssed hym, &amp; blessed hym, and turned her backe &amp; wepte, goyng her
waie, leauyng the poore innocēt chylde wepyng as faste as the mother.
            When the Cardinall and the other lordes had receyued the younge
duke, they brought him into the starre chaumbre, where the protectoure
toke him into his armes and kissed hym with these wordes: now welcome
my lorde with all my verie herte, &amp; he saied in that of likelihod euen
as he inwardely thought, and there vpon, furthwith brought him to the
kyng his brother into the bishoppes palace at Paules, and from thence
through the cytee honorably into the tower, out of which after that daie
they neuer came abrode. When the protectour had both the chyldren in
his possession, yea &amp; that they were in a sure place, he then began to thrist
to se the ende of his enterprise. And to auoyde al suspicion, he caused all
the lordes whiche he knewe to bee faithfull to the kyng, to assemble at
Baynardes castle to cōmen of the ordre of the coronacion, whyle he and
other of his complices &amp; of his affinitee at Crosbies place contriued the
contrary and to make the protectour kyng: to which counsail there were
adhibite very fewe, and they very secrete. Then began here &amp; there some
maner of mutterynge emongest the people, as though all thyng should
not long be well, though they they wy
                  ••
                not what they feared nor wherfore:
were it, that before suche greate thynges, mennes hertes (of a secrete
instinct of nature) misgeueth theim, as the southwynde sometyme
swelleth of hym selfe before a tempeste: or were it that some one manne
happely somewhat perceiuyng, filled many menne with suspiciō, thoughe
he shewed fewe menne what he knewe: howbeit, the dealyng it selfe
made men to muse on the matter, though the counsaill were close, for litle
and litle all folke drewe from the tower where the kyng was, and drewe
to Crosbies place, so that the protectoure had all the resorte, and the
kyng in maner desolate. Whyle some made suyte vnto theim that had
the doyng, some of theim were by their frendes secretly warned, that it
might happely turne them to no good to be to muche attendaunt on the
kyng without the protectoures apointemente, whiche remoued diuerse
of the kyng his olde seruauntes from him, and sette newe in their toumes
aboute hym.
            Thus many thynges cōmyng together, partly by chaunce and partly
by purpose, caused at length, not cōmon people onely, whiche wauer
with the wynde, but wyse mēne also and some lordes, to marke the matter
and muse ther vpon: in so much as the lorde Stanley whiche afterwarde
was erle of Derby wysely mistrusted it and saied to the lord Hastynges,
that he muche misliked these two seuerall counsailes, for while
we ꝙ he talke of one matter at the one place, litle wote we whereof they
talke in the other: peace my lorde ꝙ the lorde Hastynges, on my lyfe neuer
doubte you, for while one manne is there, which is neuer thence, neither
can there be any thyng once mynded that should sounde amisse towarde

This ment he by Catesby whiche was nere of his secrete counsail,
and whom he familierly vsed in his most waightie matters, puttyng no
manne in so speciall truste as him recōnyng him selfe to no man so liefe
sith he wiste well there was no man to hym so muche beholdyng as was
this Catesby, which was a māne wel learned in the lawes of this lande,
and by the speciall fauoure of the lorde Hastynges in good aucthoritie
and muche rule bare in the countries of Lecestre &amp; Northampton where
the lorde Hastynges power laye. But surely great pitie was it that he
had not had either more trueth or lesse wit, for hys dissimulacion onely,
kept all that mischief vp, in whom if the lorde Hastynges had not put so
speciall truste▪ the lorde Stanley and he with diuerse other lordes had
daparted into their countrees and broken all the daunce. for many euill
signes that he sawe, whiche he nowe construed all for the beste, so surely
thought he that there could be no harme towarde hym in that counsaill
entended where Catesbye was. And of trueth the protectoure and the
duke of Bukyngham made very good sembleaunce vnto the lorde Hastynges
and kept hym muche in their compaignye. And vndoubtedly,
the protectour loued hym well, and lothe was to haue loste hym sauyng
for feare leste his lyfe should haue quayled their purpose, for the whiche
cause he moued Catesby to proue with some wordes cast out a farre of,
whether he could thinke it possible to wynne the lorde Hastynges to their
parte. But Catesby, whether he assayed him or assayed him not, reported
vnto hym that he found him so fast, and herde him speake so terrible
wordes that he durst no farther breake: and of a truth the lorde Hastynges
of very truste shewed vnto Catesby the mistruste that other began
to haue in the matter. And therefore, he fearyng leste their mociōs might
with the lorde Hastynges minishe his credence, where vnto onely all the
matter leaned, procured the protectour hastely to ryd hym, &amp; muche the
rather, for he trusted by hys death to obtayne muche of the rule whiche
the lord Hastynges bare in hys countree, the onely desyre whereof, was
the thyng that enduced him to be procurer and one of the speciallest contriuers
of all thys horrible treason. Where vpon the lorde protectour
caused a counsaill to be set at the tower on the fridaye the thirtene daye
of Iune, where was muche commonyng for the honourable solemnitee
of the coronacion, of the whiche the tyme appoincted aproched so nere,
that the pageauntes were a makyng daye &amp; night at Westminster, and
vitaile killed whiche afterwarde was caste awaye.
            These lordes thus sittyng▪ cōmonyng of this matter, the protectour
came in emong theim about nyne of the clocke salutyng theim curteously,
excusyng him self that he had been from theim so long saiyng merely
that he had been a sleper that daye. And after a litle talkyng with theim
he sayed to the bishopp of Ely, my lorde you haue verye good strawberies
in youre garden at Holborne, I require you let vs haue a messe of
theim. Gladly (my lord ꝙ he) I would I had some better thing as redy

to your pleasure as that, and with that in all hast he sente his seruaunt
for a dishe of strawberies. The protectour set the lordes faste in cōmonyng
and there vpon prayed theim to spare him alitle, and so he departed
and came agayn betwene .x. and eleuen of the clocke into the chambre
all chaunged with a sowre angry countenaunce knittyng the browes,
frownyng and fretyng and gnawyng on his lips and so set hym
doune in his place. All the lordes were dismaied and sore marueyled of
this maner and sodeyne chaunge and what thyng should hym ayle.
When he had sitten a whyle, thus he began: What were they worthy
to haue that cōpasse and ymagine the destruccion of me beyng so neare
of bloud to the kyng &amp; protectoure of this his royall realme? At which
question, all the lordes sate fore astonyed, musyng muche by whom the
question should be ment, of which euery man knew him self clere.
            Then the lorde Hastynges as he that for the familiaritie that was
betwene theim, thought he might be boldest with hym, aunswered and
sayd that they were worthy to be punished as heynous traytours what
soeuer they were, and all the other affirmed the same, that is (ꝙ he) yonder
sorceres my brothers wife and other with her, menyng the quene, at
these woordes many of the lordes were sore abashed whiche fauoured
her, but the lorde Hastynges was better content in hys mynde that it
was moued by her then by any other that he lued better, albeit hys
hart grudged that he was not afore made of counsail of this matter as
well as he was of the takyng of her kynred and of their puttyng to
death, whiche were by hys assent before deuysed to be beheaded at
Pomfrete, this selfe same daye, in the whiche he was not ware that it
was by other deuised that he hym selfe should the same daye be beheaded
at London: then sayed the protectour in what wyse that sorceresse
and other of her counsayle, as Shores wyfe with her affinitie haue by
their sorcery and witchecrafte this wasted my body, and therwith plucked
vp his doublet▪ sleue to his elbowe on hys lette arme, where he shewed
a weryshe wythered arme &amp; small as it was neuer other. And therupon,
euery mannes mynde mysgaue theim, well perceyuyng that this
matter was but a quarell, for well they wist that the quene was both to
wyse to go about any such folye, &amp; also if she would, yet would she of al
folke make Shores wyfe least of her counsaile whom of all women she
most hated as that cōcubine whom the kyng her husband most loued.
            Also, there was no manne there but knewe that hys arme was euer
such sith the day of his birth, Neuerthelesse the lorde Hastynges, which
from the death of kyng Edward kept Shores wife, whom he somwhat
doted in the kynges lyfe, sauyng it is sayed that he forbare her for reuerence
towarde his kyng, or els of a certayne kynde of fidelitie towarde
his frend. Yet nowe his hart somewhat grudged to haue her whom he
loued so highly accused, and that as he knewe well vntruely, therefore
he aunswered and sayed, certaynly my lorde, yf they haue so doone, they
be worthy of heynous punishement, what ꝙ the protectour, thou seruest

me I wene with yf and with and, I tell the they haue done it, and that
wyll I make good on thy bodye traytour. And therewith (as in a great
anger) he clapped his fyste on the borde a great rappe, at whiche token
geuē, one cried treason without the chamber, and therwith a doore clapped,
and in came rushyng men in harneyes as many as the chamber
could hold. And anone the protectoure sayed to the lorde Hastynges, I
arrest the traytoure, what me my lorde ꝙ he? yea the traytoure ꝙ the
protectour. And one let flye at the lorde Stanley, which shroncke at the
stroacke and fell vnder the table, or els hys head had bene cleft to the
teth, for as shortly as he shrancke, yet ranne the bloud aboute his eares.
Then was the Archebishop of Yorke and doctour Morton bishopp of
Ely &amp; the lorde Stanley taken and diuers other whiche were bestowed
in dyuers chambers, saue the lorde Hastynges (whom the protectour
cōmaunded to spede and shryue hym apace) for by sainct Poule (ꝙ he)
I wyll not dyne tyll I se thy head of, it boted hum not to aske why, but
heuily he toke a priest at auenture and made a shorte shrift, for a lenger
woulde not be suffered, the protectour made so muche hast to his dyner,
which might not go to it tyll this murther were done, for sauyng of hys
vngracious othe. So was he brought furthe into the grene besyde the
chapel within the towre, and his head layed doune on a logge of tymber
that lay there for buildyng of the chapel, &amp; there tyrannously striken of,
and after his body and head wer enterred at Wyndesore by his maister
kyng Edward the forth, whose soules Iesu pardon. Amen.
            A merueilous case it is to heare, either the warnynges that he should
haue voyded, or the tokens of that he could not voyde. For the next nighte
before his death, the lorde Stanley sent to him a trusty messenger
at midnight in all the hast, requiryng hym to ryse and ryde awaye with
hym, for he was disposed vtterly no lenger for to abyde, for he had a
fearfull dreame in the whiche he thought that a bore with his tuskes so
rased them bothe by the heades that the bloud ran aboute bothe their
shoulders, and for asmuch as the protectour gaue the bore for his cognisaunce,
he ymagined that it should be he. This dreame made suche a
fearfull impression in hys harte, that he was throughly determyned no
lenger to tary but had his horse redy, yf the lorde Hastynges would go
with him. So that they would ryde so farre that night, that they should
be out of daunger by the next day. A good lord (ꝙ the lord Hastynges)

tokens of thinges to come, why thynketh he not that we might as likely
make theim true by oure goyng yf we were caught and brought backe,
(as frendes fayle fliers) for then had the bore a cause lykely to race vs
with his tuskes, as folkes that fled for some falshead, wherefore either

then abidyng. And if we should nedes fall in peril one way or other, yet

scorne, the same mornyng ere he were vp from his bed where Shores
wife lay with him all night, there came to him sir Thomas Haward
sonne to the lorde Haward (whiche lord was one of the priueyest of the

he was put in remēbraunce of another tyme, in which it happened them
to mete before together in the place, at which tyme the lorde Hastynges
had bene accused to kyng Edward by the lord Ryuers the quenes brother,
insomuche that he was for a while which lasted not long highly in
the kynges indignacion as he nowe mette the same pursiuaūt in the same

surerye, I praye God it proue so (ꝙ Hastynges, proue ꝙ he? doubtest
thou that) nay nay I warraunt the, and so in maner displeased he entered
into the Towre, where he was not long on lyue as you haue heard.
O lorde God the blyndnesse of our mortal nature, when he most feared,
he was in moste suretye, and when he reconed hym selfe moste surest, he
lost his lyfe, and that within two houres after. Thus ended this honorable
manne a good knight &amp; gentle, of great aucthoritie with his prince,
of liuyng somwhat dissolute,, playne and open to his enemy, and sure
and secrete to hys frende, easy to begyle, as he that of good harte and
courage foresawe no perilles, a louyng man and passyng welbeloued,
very faythfull and trustie ynough, but trustyng to muche was hys destruction
as you maye perceyue.
            Nowe flewe the fame of thys lordes death through the cytie and farther
about, lyke a wynde in euery mans eare, but the Protectoure immediatly
after dyner (entendyng to set some colour vpō the matter) sent
in all the haste for many substancial men out of the cytie into the Towre,
and at their cōmyng him selfe with the duke of Buckyngham stode,
harnessed in olde euill fauoured briganders, such as no mā would wene
that they would haue vouchesafed to haue put on their backes, excepte
some sodeyne necessitie had constraigned them. Then the lord protector
shewed them, that the lord Hastynges &amp; other of his conspiracy had contriued
to haue sodeynly destroyed hym and the duke of Buckyngham
there the same daie in counsail, and what they entended farther, was yet
not well knowen, of whiche their treason he had neuer knowlege before
x. of the clocke the same forenone, which sodeyn feare draue them to put
on suche harnesse as came nexte to their handes for their defence, and so
God holpe them, that the mischiefe turned vpon them that woulde haue
done it, &amp; thus he required theim to report. Euery man answered fayre,
as though no mā mistrusted the matter, which of trueth no mā beleued.
Yet for the further appeasyng of the peoples myndes, he sent immediatly
after dynner an Heralde of armes with a proclamacion through the
cytie of London whiche was proclaymed in the Kynges name, that the
lord Hastynges with diuers other of his trayterous purpose had before
conspired, the same daye to haue slayne the protectour and the duke of
Buckyngham sittyng in counsaill, &amp; after to haue taken vpon them the
rule of the kyng and the realme at their pleasure, and therby to pill and
spoyle whom they lyst vncomptrolled, &amp; muche matter was deuised in
the same proclamacion to the slaunder of the lord Hastynges, as that he
was an euyll counsailoure to the kynges father, entisyng hym to many
thynges highly redoundyng to the diminishyng of hys honoure and to

the vniuersall hurte of his realme by his euyll compaignie and sinister
procuryng and vngracious example, aswell in many other thynges as
in vicious liuyng and inordinate abusyon of his body, bothe with many
other and especiall with Shores wyfe whiche was one of his secrete
counsaill of this heynous treason, with whom he laye nightly, and namely
the night passed next before his death, so that it was the lesse marueill
yf vngracious liuynge brought hym to an vnhappy ende, whiche
he was now put to by the cōmaundemēt of the kyng his highnes and of
his honourable and faithfull counsaile, bothe for his demerites beynge
so openly taken in his false cōtriued treason, and also least the delaiyng
of his execucion might haue encouraged other mischeuous persons parteners
of hys conspiracy, to gather and assemble them selues together
in makyng so great commocion for hys deliueraunce, whose hope nowe
beyng by his well deserued death pollytickely repressed, all the realme
shall by Goddes grace rest in good quyet and peace. Nowe was thys
proclamacion made within twoo houres after he was beheaded, and it
was so curiously endyted and so fayre writen in Parchement in a fayre
sette hande, and therewith of it selfe so long a processe, that euery chyld
might perceyue that it was prepared and studyed before (and as some
men thought, by Catesby) for all the tyme betwene hys death and the
proclamacion proclaimyng, coulde skant haue suffyced vnto the bare
wrytyng alone, albeit that it had bene in paper and scribeled furthe in
haste at aduenture. So that vpon the proclaimyng thereof, one that
was scolemayster at Paules standyng by and comparyng the shortenesse
of the tyme with the length of the matter sayed to theim that
stoode aboute hym, here is a gaye goodly cast, foule cast awaye for
hast. And a marchaunte that stoode by hym sayed that it was wrytten
by inspiracyon and prophesye. Nowe then by and by, as it were for anger
and not for coueteous, the Protectoure sent sir Thomas Hawarde
to the house of Shores wyfe (for her husbande dwelte not with her)
whiche spoyled her of all that euer she had, aboue the valure of twoo or
thre thousande markes, and sent her bodye to pryson. And the Protectoure
had layde to her for the maner sake that she was a counsaill with
the lorde Hastynges to destroye hym. In conclusion, when no coloure
could fasten vpon these matters, then he layed heynously to her charge
that thyng that she could not denye, for all the world knewe that it was
true, and that notwithstandyng euery man laughed to heare it then so
sodeynly, so highly taken, that she was naught of her body. And for
this cause as a godly continent prince cleane and fautlesse of hym selfe,
sent out of heauen into thys vicious worlde, for the amendement of
mens maners, he caused the byshop of London to putte her to open penaunce,
goyng before a crosse one Sondaye at precession with a taper
in her hand. In the whiche she went in countenaunce and peace so womanly,
&amp; albeit she was out of all aray sauyng her kyrtel only, yet went
she so fayre and louely, and namely when the wondryng of the people

cast a comely red in her checkes, of the whiche she before had most mysse,
that her great shame wanne her much prayse amongest them that were
more amorous of her body then curious of her soule, and many good
folke that hated her liuyng and were glad to se synne correected, yet pitied
they more her penaunce then reioysed it, when they considered that
the protector did it more of corrupt mynd then any vertuous affection.
            This woman was borne in London,The descripcion of Sho

as they were coupled or she were well rype, she not very feruētly loued
for whom she neuer longed, which was the thyng (by chaunce) that
the more easely made her to encline to the kynges appetite, when he required
her. Howbeit the respect of his royaltie, the hope of gaye apparell,
ease, pleasure, and other wanton wealth was hable sone to perce a
softe tendre hart: but whē the kyng had abused her, anone her husband
beyng an honest manne and one that could his good, not presumyng to

kyng dyed, the lorde Hastynges toke her, whiche in the kynges dayes
albeit that he was sore enamoured with her yet he forbare, either for a
pryncely reuerence or for a certayne frendely faithfulnesse. Proper she
was and fayre, nothyng in her body that you could haue chaunged, but

day ye the lord Camberlayne was headed in the towre of London and
about the same houre should be beheaded at Poumfrete the earle Ryuers

execution was done by the ordre &amp; in the presence of sir Richard Ratclif

in the execution of suche lawlesse enterprises, as a man that had bene

shorte and rude in speche, rough and boysterous of behauour, bold in
michiefe, as farre from pytie as from all feare of God.
            This knight brought these foure persons to the scaffolde at the daye
apoincted, &amp; shewed to all the people that they were traitours, not sufferyng
the lordes to speake, &amp; to declare their innocēcy, least their wordes
might haue enclined men to pytie them and to hate the protectour &amp; his

thus beheaded and ryd out of the waye, then the protectour caused it to
be proclaymed that the coronacion for diuers great and vrgent causes
should be deferred tyll the seconde daye of Nouember, for then thought
he, that whyle men mused what the matter meant, and while the lordes
of the realme were about him, out of their awne strengthes, and whyle
no man wyste what to thynke nor whom to truste, or euer they should
haue tyme and space to digest the matter, and make partes, it were best
hastely to pursue his purpose and put hym self in possession f the croune,
or menne could haue tyme to deuyse any wyse to resyste. But nowe
was all the study, this matter beyng of it selfe so heynous might be first
broken to the people in suche wyse as it might well be taken. To this
counsaile they toke diuerse such as they thought mete to be trusted and
likely to be enduced to that parte and hable to stand theim in steade, eyther
by powre or by polycye. Emong whom, they made a counsaile Edmond
Shaa then Mayre of London, whiche vpon trust of hys awne
auauncement, where he was of a proude harte highly desirous, toke on
hym to frame the cytie to their appetite. Of spirituall men they toke suche
as had wytte, and were in aucthoritie emongest the people for opinion
of their learnyng, and had no scrupulous conscience. Emongest
these had, they toke Raffe Shaa clearke brother to the Mayre, &amp; Freer,
Pynkie prouinciall of the Augustine Freers, bothe doctours in diuinitie,
bothe great preachers, bothe of more learnyng then vertue, of more
fame then learnyng, &amp; yet of more learnyng then trueth. For they were
before greatly estemed emong the people, but after that, neuer none of
these two were regarded. Shaa made a sermonde in prayse of the Protectour
before the coronacion, and Pynkye made one after the coronacion,
bothe 
                  •
               o full of tedious flattery, that no good mans eares coulde
abyde them, Pynkye in his sermonde so loste his voyce that he was fayne
to leaue of and come doune in the myddest, Doctoure Shaa by his
sermonde loste his honesty, and sone after his lyfe, for very shame of the
worlde, into the whiche he durst neuer after muche come abroade, but
the Freer forced for no shame, and so it harmed hym the lesse. Howbeit,
some doubt and many thynke that Pynkey was not of counsaill
before the coronacion, but after the common maner fell to flattery after,
namely, because his sermond was not incontinent vpon it, but at sainct
Mary Spittle the Easter after. But certayne it is that doctour Shaa
was of coūsaill in the beginnyng, in so much that they determyned that
he should fyrst breake the matter in a sermond at Poules crosse, in whiche
he should by the ancthoritie of hys preachyng induce the people to
encline to y• protectours ghostly purpose. But now was all the laboure

and study in the deuise of some conuenient pret

should be content to depose the prince &amp; accept the protectour for kyng▪

                  •
               he weight
of all that inuencion rested in this, that they shoulde allege bastardy in
kyng Edwarde hym selfe, or in his chyldren, or bothe, so that he should
seme disabled to enherite the croune by the duke of Yorke and the prince
by him. To lay bastardy in kyng Edward sounded openly to the rebuke
o
                  •
                the protectours awne mother, whiche was mother to theim bothe.
For in that poinct could be none other coloure, but to pretende that his
awne mother was an auoutresse, but neuerthelesse he would that poinct
should be lesse and more fynely &amp; closely handled, not euen fully playne
and directely, but touched a 
                  ••
               ope craftely, as though menne spared in
that poinct to speake all the trueth for feare of his displeasure. But that
other poincte concernyng the basterdy they deuised to surmysse in kyng
Edward his chyldren, that would he should be openly declared and enforced
to the vttermost. The coloure and pretexte wherof cannot be well
perceyued excepte wee repete some thinges long before dooen aboute
kyng Edward his marriages.
            After kyng Edwarde the fourthe had deposed kyng henry the sixte
and was in peaceable possession f the realme, determinyng 
                  •

therle of Warwike &amp; diuerse other noble men in ambassade to the Frenche
kyng to entreate a mariage betwene the kyng and Bona sister to the
Frenche quene, then beyng in Fraunce. In which thyng therle of Warwike
founde the parties so towarde and willyng, that he spedely without
any difficultie accordyng to his instruccions brought the matter to
a good conclusion. Nowe happeneth it in the meane season, there came
to make a sute to the kyng by peticion dame Elizabeth Grey (whiche
after was his quene) then a widdowe, borne of noble bloude, specially
by her mother, whiche was Duchesse of Bedforde, and she was maried
to sir Richarde Wooduile lorde Riuers, her father.
            Howbeit, this Elizabeth beyng in seruice with quene Margaret wife
to kyng Henry the sixte, was maried to one Ihon Grey Esquire whom
kyng Henry made knight at the la

               te battaill of sainct Albones, but litle
while he enioyed his knighthod, for at thesame feld he was slain.
            After, when that kyng Edward was kyng and the Erle of Warwike
beyng on his ambassad, this poore lady made sute to the kyng to be restored
to suche smal ladnes as her husbande had geuen her in ioyntoure,
whom when the kyng behelde and harde her speake▪ as she was bothe
faire and of good fauoure, moderate of stature, well made and very
wyse, he not alonely pitied her, but also wexed enamored on her, and takyng
her secretely a syde began to enter into talkyng more familierly,
whose appetite when she perceyued▪ she verteously denied hym, but that
she dyd so wysely and that with so good maner and woordes so wel set,
that she rather kyndeled his desyre then quenched it. And finally after

many a metyng and much wowyng and many greate promises she well
espied the kyng his affeccion towarde her so greately encreased that she
durste somewhat the more bodely saye her mynde, as to hym whose hert
she perceyued more feruently set then to fall of for a worde. And in conclu
                  •
               ion
she shewed him plain that as she wist her self to simple to be his
wife, so thought she her self to good to be his cōcubine. The kyng much
marueilyng of her constancy, as she that had not been wonte els where
so stiefly sayed nay, so muche estemed her continency and chastitee, that
he sette her vertue in steade of possession and richesse: And this takyng
coun
                  •
               aill of his owne desyre determined in haste to mary her. And after
that he was thus apoincted and had betwene them twayn ensured her,
then asked he counsaill of hys secrete frendes, and that in suche maner
that they might easly perceyue that it boted not to saye nay. Notwithstandyng
the duches of Yorke his mother, was so sore moued therewith
that she disswaded that mariage as muche as she possible might: allegyng
that it was his honor▪ profyte &amp; surety, to mary in some noble progeny
out of hys realme, where vpon depended greate strengthe to hys
estate by that affinite, and great possibilite of encrease of his dominiōs.
And that he could not well otherwise doe, consideryng the erle of Warwike
had so farfurthe entered into the matter all ready, whiche was not
lyke to take it well if all hys voyage were in suche wyse frus
                  •
               rate &amp; his
appoinctemente deluded. And she sayed ferther, tha it was not princely

                  •
               iō ledyng there vnto, no possessions

manne would mary hys mayden onely for a litle wanton dotage vpon
her person. In whiche mariage many menne cōmend more the maydens
fortune then the mannes wisedome, &amp; yet she sayed that there was more
honesty then honour in this mariage, fora
                  •
               much as ther is not betwene
a marchaunt &amp; his mayde so greate a difference as betwene a kyng and
his subiecte, a greate prince and a poore widowe. In whose persone, allthough
there were nothyng to bee mi
                  ••
               yked yet was there sayed she, nothyng
so excellent but that it might be found in diuerse other that were
more metely (ꝙ she) for your estate: yea and maidens also, the onely widowhed
of dame Elizabeth Grey (although she were in all other poinctes
and thynges conuenient for you) should suffice as me thynketh to
refrain you from her mariage, sith it is an vnsittyng thyng and a great
blemishe to the sacred maiestie of a prince, that ought as nere to approche
priesthode in clennesse, as he doeth in dignitie, to be defiled with bygamy
in his first mariage. The kyng made his mother an answere part
in earnest and part in playe merely, as he that wyste hym selfe out of her
rule: &amp; albeit he would gladly that she should take it well▪ yet was he at
ap
                  •
               inct in his owne mynde, toke she it wel or otherwyse▪ Howbeit, somewhat
to satisfy her he saied, that albeit mariage beyng a spiritual thyng
ou
                  •
               ht rather to be made for the respecte of God, where his grace enclineth,
the parties ought to encline to loue together (as he trusted it was

in his case) rather then for the regard of any temporall auauntage: yet
neuertheles hym semed this mariage well considered not to bee vnprofitable,
for he reconed the amitee of no earthely nacion to bee so necessary
for hym as the frendeship of his awne, whiche he thoughte likely to
beare hym so muche the more hartye fauour, in that he disdaigned not to
mari with one of his awne lande: &amp; yet if outward aliaunce wer thought
so requisite, he woulde finde the meanes to entre therunto muche better
by other of his kinne where all the parties coulde bee contented, then to
mary hym selfe wherein he shoulde neuer happely loue, and for the possibilitee
of possessions lese the fruite and pleasure of this that he had alreadye.
For small plasure taketh a manne of al that euer he hath besyde,
yf he bee wiued againste his appetite, and I doubte not (quod he,) but
there bee as you saie other that bee in euery poinct comparable with her,
and therefore I lette not them that like theim to mary theim, no more is
it reason that it mislike any manne that I mary where it liketh me. And
I am sure that my cousyn of Warwike, neither loueth me so litle, to
grudge at that that I loue, ner is so vnreasonable to loke that I should
in choyse of a wife rather bee ruled by his yie then by myne awne, as
though I wer a warde that wer bounden to mary by the apoynctement
a guarden. I would not bee a kyng with that cōdicion to forbeare mine
awne libertie in choyse of mine awne mariage. As for possibilite of more
in
                  •
               eritaunce by newe affinitee in straunge landes, is oft the occasion of
more trouble then proffite. And we haue already title by that meanes, as

                  ••
               ffiseth to somuch as suffiseth to gette &amp; kepe wel in one mannes daies.
That she is a widdowe and hath alredy children: By god his blessed lady,
I am a bacheler and haue some to, &amp; so eche of vs hath a proofe, that
neither of vs is like to be barren. And therefore madame I praye you be
contente. I trust to God she shall bryng furthe a young prince that shal
please you. And as for the bigamy, lette the bishop hardely laie it to my
charge when I come to take ordres, for I vnderstande it is forbidden a
prieste put I neuer wiste that it was forbidden a prince. The duchesse
with these woordes nothynge apeased and seynge the kynge so sette on
that she could not plucke him backe, so highly she disdaigned it, that vnder
pretexte of her duety to God warde, she deuised to disturbe this mariage,
and rather to helpe that he should mary one dame Elizabet Lucy,
whom the kynge not longe before had gotten with chylde, wherefore the
kynge his mother obiected openly againste this mariage (as i
                  •
                wer in
discarge of her consience) that the king was sure to dame Elizabeth Lucy
and her husband and before God, by reason of whiche wordes suche
obstacle was made in that matter, that either the bishoppe durste not, or
the kyng would not proceade to the solemnisacion of the mariage, til his
fame were clerely purged, and the truth well and opēly testified. Where
vpon dame Elizabeth Lucye was sente for, and albeit she was by the
kyng his mother and many other put in good comforte to affirme that
was assured to the kynge, yet when she was solemply sworne to saie the

truth, she confessed she was neuer ensured. Howebeeit she saied, his
grace spake suche louynge woordes to her, that she verely hoped that he
woulde haue maried her, and that yf suche kinde woordes had not been,
she woulde neuer haue shewed suche kyndenesse to hym, to lette him so
kindely gette her with childe. This examinacion solemply taken, it was
clerely proued that there was no impedimente to let the kynge to mary,
wherefore, he shortely after at Grafton beside Stonystratforde maried
the lady Elizabeth Grey verie priuely, which was his enemies wife
and had praied hartely for his losse, in the whiche God loued her better
then to graunte her her bone, for then had she not been his wife: And after
that she was crouned quene, and her father was created erle Riuers
and her sonne created Marques Dorset. But whē the erle of Warwike
vnderstode of this mariage, he toke it so highly, that therof ensued much
trouble and greate bloudshed as is declared before in the story of Edward
the .iiii.
            I haue rehersed this mariage somewhat the more at length, because
it might thereby the better apere vpon how slipper a ground the protector
builded his colour, by whiche he pretended kynge Edwarde his children
to be bastardes, but the inuencion, as simple as it was liked theim
to whom it suffiseth to haue somewhat to saie, while they were sure to be
compelled to no larger profe then theim selues liste to make.
            Nowe to returne where I left, as I beganne to shewe you, it was by
the protector and his counsaill concluded that this doctor Shaa should
in a sermon at Paules crosse signifie to the people that neither king Edwarde
hym selfe nor the duke of Clarence wer lawefully begotten, nor
wer the very children of the duke of Yorke, but begotten vnlawfully by
other persones by aduoutry of the duches their mother. And that dame
Elizabeth Lucy was the very wife of kynge Edward, and so prince Edward
and all the children begotten on the quene wer bastardes. And accordyng
to this deuise, doctor Sha the sondaie after at Paules crosse in
in a greate audience (as alwaie a greate numbre assembled to his preachyng,
came into the pulpit takyng for his Theme. Spuria vitulamina nō

                  ••
               ppes shal neuer
take depe rootes: whereupon when he had shewed the greate grace that
God geueth &amp; secretely infoundeth in right generacion after y• lawes of
matrimony, then declared he that those children cōmenly lacked y• grace
(&amp; for the punishement of their parentes) were for ye most part vnhappy
which wer gotten in baste, and specially in aduoutry, of whiche (though
some by the ignorauncie of the worlde and the truthe hid from knowlege)
haue enherited for a season other mennes landes, yet God alwaie
of prouideth that it continueth not in their bloude longe, but the
truethe commynge to lighte the rightefull enheritoures bee restored,
and the bastard s
                  •
               ppes plucked vp or it can bee rooted depe. And when
he had laied for the proofe and confirmacion of this sentence, examples
taken oute of the olde testamente and other aunciente histories, then

began he to discende to the praise of the lord Richard duke of Yorke, callyng
hym father to the protectour and declared his title to the croune biinheritaunce
and also by entaile authorised by parliament after y• death
of kynge Henry the sixte. Then shewed he that the lorde protector, was
onely the righte heire, of his body lawfully begotten. Then declared he
that kyng Edward was neuer lawfully maried to ye quene, but his wife
before God was dame Elizabeth Lucy, and so his children wer bastardes.
And besides that, that neither kyng Edward hym selfe nor the duke
of Clarence emongest them that wer secrete in the duke of Yorkes houshoulde)
were neuer reconed surely to bee the children of the noble duke
as those that by their fauoures more resembled other knowen menne
then hym, from whose verteous condicions he saied, also that kyng Edwarde
was farre of. But the lorde protector (quod he) that veraye noble
prince, the speciall patrone of knightly prowes, aswell in all princely behaueour
as in the liniamentes and fauour of his visage representeth the
very 
                  •
               ace of ye noble duke his father. This is (quod he) the fathers awne
figure, this is his awne countenaunce the verie printe of his visage, the
sure vndoubted ymage, the playne expresse likenesse of that noble duke.
Nowe was it before deuised that in the speakynge of these wordes, the
protector shoul
                  •
               e haue come in emongest the people to y• sermond ward,
to thende that these wordes so metynge with his presence, mighte haue
been taken emongest the herers, as though the holy ghoste had put theim
in the preachers mouthe, and shoulde haue moued the people euen
there to haue cried, kynge Richarde that it mighte haue been after sayed
that he was specially chosen by God▪ and in maner by miracle: but this
deuise quayled, either by the protectoures negligence or the preachers
ouer hasty diligence. For while the protectoure, founde by the waye ta
               
                  •
               iynge,

that he shoulde come or his sermon coulde come to those woordes
hastynge his matter thereto, he was come to theim and paste theim, and
entred into other matters or the protectour came, whom when he beheld
commynge, he sodainly lefte the matter whiche he had in hand, and without
any deduccyon therunto out of all ordre, and out of all frame began
to repete those woordes agayne. This is the very noble prince the especiall
patrone of knightely prowes, whiche aswell in all princely behaueoure
as in the liniamentes and fauour of his visage representeth the
veray
                  •
                face of the noble duke of Yorke his father. This is the fathers
awne figure, this is his own

                countenaunce▪ the very print of his visage
the sure vndoubted image, the plain expresse likenesse of that noble duke,
whose remembraunce can neuer die while he liueth. While these wordes
were in speakyng, the protectour accompaignied with the duke of
Buckyngham, wente through the people vp into the place wher the doctors
stande where they harde oute the sermond: but the people wer so far
from

into stoones for wonder of this shamefull sermonde: after whiche once

ended y• precher gat hym home and neuer after durst loke out for shame
but kept hym out of sighte as an owle and when he asked any of his old

well shewed hym that they talked no good, yet when the other answered
hym, that there was in euery mannes mouthe of hym muche shame spoken
it so strake hym too the harte that in fewe dayes after he withered
awaie.
            Then on the tuesday after next foloyng this sermond, beyng the xvii.

ye shall doo greate profite to all this his realme: Beside that, in chosyng

in howe muche he shall perceiue you the more prone and beneuolentely
mynded toward his election: wherin dere frendes, what mynd you haue
we require you plainely to shewe vs? When the duke had saied and loked
that the people whom he hoped that the Maire had framed before,
shoulde after this flatterynge preposicion made, haue cried kynge Richarde,
kynge Richarde, all was still and mute and not one woorde answered
to: wherwith the duke was maruelous

               y abashed, and takynge y•
Maire nere to hym, with other that wer aboute hym priuy to the matter,
saied vnto theim softely. What meaneth this, that the people be so still?
Sir quod the Maire, percase thei perceiue you not well, that shall wee
amende quod he, if that wil helpe, and therwith somewhat lowder rehersed
the same matter again, in other ordre and other woordes so well and
ornately, and neuerthelesse so euidently and plaine, with voice, gesture, &amp;
countenaunce so comely and so conuenient, that euery man muche marueiled
that hard him and thought that they neuer harde in their liues so
euill a tale so well tolde. But wer it for wonder or feare, or that eche loked
that other shoulde speake firste, not one worde was there answered
of all the people that stoode before, but all were as still as the midnight,
not so muche as rounyng emong theim, by whiche thei mighte seme once
to common what was before too doo. When the Maire sawe this, he with
other parteners of the counsaill, drewe aboute the duke and saied that y•
people had not been a

               customed there to be spoken too, but by the Recorder,
whiche is the mouthe of the citee, and happely too hym they will
answere. With that the Recorder called Thomas Filz Wyllyā, a sadde
manne and an honeste, which was but newlye come to the office, and neuer
had spoken to the people before, and lothe was with that matter to
begyn notwithstandyng, there vnto commaunded by the Maire, made
rehersall to the commons of that whiche the duke had twise purposed
hym self, but the recorder so tēpered his tale, that he shewed euery thyng
as the duke his woordes were, and no parte of his owne, but all this no
chaunge made in the people, wiche alwaie after one stoode as they had
been amased. Where vpon, the duke rouned with the Maire and sayed,
this is a marueileous obstinate scilence, and there with turned too the
people again with these woordes. Deare frendes, wee come to moue you
too that thyng whiche parauenture wee so greately neded not, but that
the lordes of this realme and commons of other partes might haue suffised,
sauyng suche loue we beare you, and so muche set by you▪ that we

woulde not gladly doo without you, that thyng in whiche to bee parteners
is your weale and honoure, whiche as to vs semeth you se not or
waye not: Where fore wee require you to geue vs an answere, one or other,
whether ye bee mynded as all the nobles of the realme bee, to haue
this noble prince now protector to bee your kyng? And at these wordes
the people began to whisper emong them selfes secretely, that the voyce
was neither loude nor base, but like a swarme of bees▪ till at the laste, at
the nether ende of the hal a bushement of the dukes seruauntes and one
Nashfeelde and other belongynge to the protectoure with some prentices
and laddes that thrusted into the hall emongest the preace, began sodainly
at mennes backes to crye out as lowde as they could, kynge Richard,
kyng Richard, and there threwe vp their cappes in token of ioye,
and thei that stoode before cast backe their heddes marueilynge therat,
but nothyng thei saied. And when the duke and the Maire saw this maner,
thei wisely turned it to their purpose, and saied it was a goodly crie
and a ioyfull to here euery manne with one voyce and no manne saiyng
nay. Wherefore frendes (quod the duke,) sithe we perceiue that it is al
your whole mindes to haue this noble manne for your kyng, wherof we
shall make his grace so effectuall reporte that we doubt not but that it
shall redounde to your greate wealth and commodite. We therefore require
you that to morowe ye go with vs and wee with you to his noble
grace to make our humble peticiō and request to him in maner before remembred.
And therwith the lordes came downe and the compaignie dissolued
and departed the more parte all sad, some with glad sembleaunce
that were not very merie, and some of them that came with the duke, not
hable to dissemble their sorowe, were fain euen at his backe to turne their
face to the wall, while the doloure of their hartes braste out of their
yies.
            Then on the morowe the Maire and aldremen and chief commoners
of the citee in their best maner appareled, assemblyng theim together at
Paules, resorted to Baynardes castle where the protectoure laie, to
whiche place also accordyng too the appoin
                  •
               tment repaired the duke of
Buckyngham, and diuerse nobles with hym, besides many knyghtes
and gentlemen. And there vpon the duke sente woorde to the lorde protectoure
of the beyng there of a greate honourable compaignie to moue
a greate matter to his grace. Where vpon the protectoure made greate
difficulte to come doune to theim, excepte he knewe some parte of their
errande, as thoughe he doubted and partely mistrusted the commynge
of suche a numbre to hym so sodainely, without any warnyng or knowlege,
whether they came for good or harme. Then when the duke had
shewed this too the Mayre and other, that thei mighte there by se how
litle the protectour loked for this matter, they sente again by the messenger
suche louynge message, and there with so humbly besoughte hym
to vouchsafe that thei mighte resorte to his presence to purpose their entent
of wich thei woulde to none other persone any parte disclose. At the

last he came out of his chambre, and yet not doune to theim, but in a galary
ouer theim with a bishop on euery hande of hym, were thei beneth
might se hym and speke to hym, as thoughe he woulde not yet come nere
them til he wist what they meante. And there vpon, the duke of Buckyngham
firste made humble peticion to hym on the behalfe of theim all,
that his grace woulde pardon theim and licence them to purpose vnto
his grace the entent of their commyng without his displeasure, without
whiche pardon obteined, they durste not bee so bold to moue hym of that
matter. In whiche, albeit they meante as muche honoure to his grace as
wealth to all y• realme beside, yet were thei not sure how his grace would
take it, whom they would in no wise offende. Then the protectour, as he
was verie gentle of hym selfe and also longed sore apparantly to knowe
what they meante, gaue hym leaue to purpose what hym liked, verely
trustynge for the good minde that he bare them all, none of theim any
thyng woulde entende to hym warde, wherewith he thought to bee greued
When the duke had this leaue and pardon to speake, then wexed he
bolde to shewe hym their entente and purpose, with all the causes mouyng
theim thereto as ye before haue harde. And finally▪ to beseche his
grace taht it would like hym of his accustomed goodnesse and zeale vnto
the realme now with his yie of pitie to beholde the long continued distresse
and decaie of the same, &amp; to set his gracious hande to the redresse
and amendemente thereof by takynge vpon hym the croune and gouernaunce
of the realme accordyng to his right and title laufully discēded
vnto hym▪ and to the laude of god profite and surety of the lande &amp; vnto
his grace so much the more honor and lesse pain, in that y• neuer prince

               saūce
as the people of this realme vnder his.
            When the protector had harde the proposicion, he loked very strangely
therat and made answere, that albeit he knewe partely the thynges
by theim alleged to bee true, yet suche entiere loue he bare to kynge Edward
and his children▪ and so muche more regarded his honour in other
realmes aboute, then the croune of any one▪ of whiche he was neuer desyrous,

               oune, in whiche he had euer perchaunce perceyued muche more labour

them o
                  •
                the mocion that they made hym, but also thanked them for
the loue and harty fauoure they bare hym, praiyng theim for his sake to

to liue and with his labour &amp; counsaill as far as it should like the kyng

good estate whiche was all redye in the litle tyme of his protectourship
(lauded bee God,) wel begon, in that the malice of such as were before y•
occasion of the contrarie and of newe entended to bee, wer nowe partely
by good policy, partely more by God his speciall prouidence, then mannes
prouision, repressed and put vnder.
            Upon this answer geuen, the duke of Buckyngham by the protector
his licence a litle rounded, as well with other noble men aboute hym as
with the maire and recorder of London. And after that (vpon like perdō
desired and obteined) he shewed aloude vnto the protectour, for a finall
conclusion that the realme was apointed that kynge Edwarde his line
should no longer reigne vpon them, bothe that they had so far gone that
it was now no suretee to retreate (as for that thei thought it for y• weale
vniuersal to take ye waie, although thei had not yet begon it.) Wherfore
if it would like his grace to take the croune vpon him, they would humbly
beseche him therunto, and yf he would geue theim a resolute answere
to the contrarye (whiche thei would bee lothe to here) then must they seke
and shoulde not faill to find some other noble manne that would. These
wordes muche moued the protector, whiche as euery man of small intelligence
maie wit woulde neuer haue enclined thereto: but when he sawe
there was none other waye but that he muste take it, or els he and his
bothe to go from it, he saied to the lordes and commons, sithe it is wee
perceiue well that all the realme is so sette (wherof we bee very sory) that
they will not suffre in any wise kynge Edwarde his line to gouerne theim,
whom no man earthely can gouerne against their willes: And we also
perceiue that no manne is there to whome the crowne c

title appertaine as to our selfe as very righte heire laufully begotten of

to whiche title is now ioyned your election, the nobles and commons of
the realme, whiche we of all titles possible take for mooste effectuall, wee
bee contente and agree fauourably to encline to your peticion &amp; request,
and accordynge to the same, here we take vpon vs the royall estate of
preheminence and kyngdome of the twoo noble realmes, Englande and
Fraunce, the one from this daie forwarde by vs and our heires to rule,
gouerne and defende, the other by God his grace and youre good helpe
to get again, subdue and establishe for euer in dewe obedience vnto this
realme of Englande, the auauncemente whereof we neuer aske of God
longer to liue then we entende to procure and sette furthe. With this
there was a greate cry and shoute, criyng kyng Richard, and so the lordes
wente vp to the kynge, and so he was after that daie called. But
the people departed talkynge dyuersely of the matter, euery man as his
fantasye gaue hym, but muche thei marueiled of this maner of dealyng,
that the matter was on bothe partes made so straunge as though neuer
the one parte had commaun
                  •
               d with the other parte thereof before,
when thei wiste that there was no manne so dull that hearde theim, but
he perceyued well ynough that all the matter was made betwene them.

Howbeit, some excused that again, saiynge: all thynge muste bee doen in
good ordre, and menne muste sometyme for the maner sake not bee aknowen
what they knowe. For at the consecracion of a bishoppe, euery
manne perceiueth by paiment of his bulles that he entendeth to bee one,
yet when he is twise asked whether he will be a bishop, he muste twise
saye naie, aud at the thirde tyme take it vpon hym as compelled thereto
by his awne will. And in a stage plaie, the people knowe right well that
he that plaieth the sowdaine, is percase a souter▪ yet yf one of acquaintaunce
perchaunce of litle nurture shoulde call hym by his name while
he standeth in his maiestie one of his tourmētours might fortune breke
his hed for marryng the plaie. And so they saied, these matters bee kynges
games, as it were staige playes, and for the moste parte plaied

tragedy of this infortunate prince,

proceded, and by sodayn deathe ended
his infortunate life: But yf I should

wickednes, to aduoyde and expell all synne and mischiefe, for dread of
obloquy and worldly shame: for contrary set to contrary is more apparaunt,

I will procede in his actes after my accustomed vsage.

openly toke vpon hym to bee kyng, the nyntene daie of Iune, in the yere
of our lord, a thousand foure hundred lxxxiii. and in the .xxv. yere of Lewes

there sate in the seate roial, and called before him the iudges of y• realme

and then he departed towarde the Abbaye▪ and at the churche doore he
was mett with procession, and by the abbot to hym was deliuered the
scepter of faincte Edwarde, and so went and offered to saincte Edwarde
his shrine, while the Monkes sang Te deum with a faint courage, and
from the churche he returned to the palice, where he lodged till the coronacion.
And to be sure of all enemies (as he thoughte) he sent for fiue
thousand men of the North against his coronaciō, whiche came vp eiuil
appareled and worse harneissed, in rusty harneys, neither defensable nor
skoured to the sale, whiche mustered in Finesbury felde, to the great disdain
of all the lookers on.
            The fourth daie of Iuly he came to the tower by water with his wife,
and the fifth daie he created Edward his onely begotten sonne, a childe
of .x. yere olde, prince of wales, and Ihon haward, a man of great knowlege
and vertue (aswell in counsaill as in battaill) he created duke of

Norffolke, and sir Thomas Hawarde his sonne he created erle of
Surrey, and Willyam lorde Barkeley was then created erle of Notingham,
and Fraunces lorde Louell was then made Uicount Louel, and
the kynge his chamberlain, and the lorde Stanley was deliuered oute
of warde for feare of his sonne the lorde Straunge, whiche was then
in Lancasshire gatherynge menne (as menne saied) and the sayed lorde
was made Stauarde of the kynge his housholde, likewyse the Archebishop
of Yorke was deliuered: but Morton bishop of Ely, was deliuered
to the duke of Buckyngham to kepe inwarde, whiche sente hym to
his manoure of Brecknoke in Wales, from whence he escaped to kyng
Richarde his confusion, The same nighte the kynge made seuentene
knightes of the Bath. The nexte daie he roade through London with
greate pompe, and in especiall the duke of Buckyngham was richely
appareled and his horse trapped in blew beluet enbroudered with the
naues of cartes burnyng of gold: which trapper was borne by fotemen
from the grounde, with suche solemne fassion that all menne muche regarded
it.
            On the morowe beeyng the sixt dare of Iuly, the kynge came toward
his coronacion into Westminster hall, where his chapell and all the prelates
mitred receiued him. And so they in ordre of procession passed forwarde:
After the procession folowed therle of Northumberlande with a
poinctelesse sword naked, and the lorde Stanley bare the Mace of y• cō
               stableshippe.
Therle of Kente bare the seconde sword on the righte hand
of the kyng naked. The lorde Louell bare an other sworde on the lefte
hand. Then folowed the duke of Suffolke with the scepter, and the erle
of Lyncolne with the ball and crosse. After theim folowed the newe
erle of Surrey with the sword of estate in a riche skabard. On the right
side of hym wente the duke of Norfolke bearynge the crowne: then folowed
kynge Richarde in a Circot and robe of purple veluet vnder a canabie
borne by the barones of the fyue portes, gooynge betwene the
bishoppes of Bathe and Duresme. The duke of Buckingham with the
rod of the high stuarde of Englande bare the kyng his train. After hym
folowed therle of Huntyngdon, berynge the quenes scepter, and the Uicount
lisle, bearyng the rod with the doue, And the erle of Wilshire bare
the quenes croune. Then folowed quene Anne daughter to Richard erle
of Warwike in robes like to the king, betwene two bishoppes, and a canabie
ouer her hed, borne by the Barones of the portes. On her hed a
riche coronall sette with stone and pearle. After her folowed the coūtesse
of Richemond heire to the duke of Somerset, whiche bare vp the quenes
trayne. After folowed the duchesse of Suffolke and Norfolke with
countesses, baronesses, ladies, and many faire gentlewomen: in this ordre
they passed throughe the palayce, and entred the Abbaye at the
Weste ende, and so came to their seates of estate. And after diuerse
songes solemply songe, they bothe discended to the highe altare and

were shifted from their robes, and had diuerse places open from the
middle vpward, in whiche places thei were anointed. Then bothe the
kyng and the quene chaunged theim into clothe of golde and ascended
to their seates, where the cardinall of Cauntorbury and other bishoppes
theim crowned accordynge to the olde custome of the realme, geuynge
hym the scepter in the lefte hand and the balle with the crosse in the right
hande, and the quene had the scepter in her right hande, and the rod with
the doue in the lefte hande: On euery side of the kyng stoode a duke, and
before him stoode the erle of Surrey with the sweard in his handes. And
on euery side of the quene standynge a bishoppe and a lady knelynge.
The Cardinall song the masse, and after paxe, the kynge and the quene
discended, and before the high altare they were bothe houseled with one
hoste deuided betwene theim. After masse finished, they bothe offered at
saincte Edward his shrine and there the kyng lefte the crowne of saincte
Edward, and putte on his owne crowne. And so in ordre as they came,
they departed to Westminster hal, and so to their chambres for a ceason,
duryng which tyme the duke of Norffolke came into the hall his horse
trapped to the grounde in clothe of gold as high marshall, and voyded
the hall.
            Aboute foure of the clocke the kyng and quene entred the hal, and the
kyng satte in the midle, and the quene on the lefte hand of the table, and
on euery side of her floode a countesse holdynge a clothe of pleasaunce,
when she liste to drynke. And of the right hande of the kyng satte the bishop
of Countorbury, the ladies satte all on one side in the middle of the
hall, and at the table againste them satte the Chauncelloure and all
the lordes. At the table next the cupborde satte the Maire of London.
And at the table behinde the lordes, satte the Barones of the portes.
And at the other bordes satte noble and worshipful personages. When
all persones were sette, the duke of Norfolke erle Marshall, the erle of
Surrey constable for that daie, the lorde Stanly lorde Stewarde, syr
William Hopton treasourer, and sir Thomas Percy comptroller came
in and serued the kyng solemply with one dishe of golde and another of
siluer. And the quene all in gylte vessell, and the bishop all in siluer. At
the seconde course came into the hall, sir Robert Democke the kynge his
champion, makynge a proclamacion, that whosoeuer woulde saie that
kynge Richard was not lawefully kynge, he woulde fighte with hym at
the vtteraunce and threwe downe his gauntlet: and then al the hal cried
kynge Richarde. And so he did in three partes of the hall, and then one
brought hym a cup with wine couered, &amp; when he had dronke he cast out
the drynke, and departed with the cup. After that, the herauldes cried
a largesse thrise in the hall, and so went vp to their staige. At the ende of
diner, the Maire of Londō serued the kyng and quene with swete wyne,
and had of eche of theim a cuppe of golde with a couer of golde. And by
that tyme that all was dooen, it was darkenight: And so the king returned
to his chambre, and euery manne to his lodgyng. When this feaste

was thus fineshed, the kynge sente home all the lordes into their
countrees that woulde departe, excepte the lorde Stanley, whom he reteyned
till he harde what his sonne the lorde straunge wente aboute.
And to suche as wente home, he gaue straighte charge and commaundemente
to see their countrees well ordred, and that no wronge nor extorcion
shoulde bee doen to his subiectes. And thus he taughte other
to execute iustice and equitee, the contrarye whereof he daily exercised:
he also with greate rewardes geuen to the Northrenmen whiche he sent
for to his coronacion, sente them home to their countree with greate
thankes. Whereof diuerse of theim, (as they all be of nature very gredy
of autoritee, and specially when they thynke to haue any comforte or
fauoure.) tooke on theim so highly and wroughte suche mastries, that
the kynge was faine to ride thether in his firste yere, and to putte some
in execucion, and staie the countree, or els no small mischiefe had ensued
            Incontinente after this, he sente a solempne Ambassade to Lewes
the Frenche kynge, to conclude a league and amitie with hym, trustynge
also to obtayne the tribute whiche kynge Edwarde his brother
had before out of Fraunce, but the Frenche kyng so abhorred hym and
his crueltie, that he would neither se nor heare his Ambassadors, an so
in vayne they returned.
            Nowe after this triumphante coronacion, there fell mischifes thicke
and thicke, and as the thynge eiuill gotten is neuer well kepte, so
throughe all the tyme of his vsurped reigne, neuer ceased there cruell
murther, death and slaughter, til his awne destruction ended it. But
as he finished with the best deathe and mooste rightewyse, that is to saie
his awne, so beganne he with the mooste piteous and wicked, I meane
the lamentable murther of his innocente nephewes, the younge kynge
and his tendre brother, whose deathe and finall fortune hath neuerthelesse
so far come in question that some remained longe in doubte whether
they were in his daies destroied or no. Not for that that Parkin
warbek by many folkes malice, and mo folkes folly so longe space abusynge
the worlde, was aswell with princes as with poore people reputed
and taken for the younger of these twoo: But for that also that all
thynges were so couertely demeaned, one thynge pretented and another
mente, that there was nothynge so plaine and openly proued, but that
yet for the common custome o

euer inwardly suspecte, as many well counterfet iewelles make the true
mistrusted. Hobeit, concernynge that opinion, menne maie se the conueighaunce
thereof in the lyfe of the noble prince kynge Henrye the .vii.
in the processe of Parkyn. But in the meane ceason, for this presente
matter I shall reherse to you the dolorous ende of these two babes, not
after euery waie that I haue harde, but after that waie that I haue so
hard by suche menne and suche meanes as me thinketh it to be hard but
it shoulde be true.

to visite in his newe honour the towne, of which he bare the name of old,
deuised as he roade to fulfill that thyng whiche he before had intended.
And forasmuch as his mynd gaue hym that his nephewes liuynge, men
woulde not recon that he coulde haue righte to the realme. he thoughte
therefore without delaie to rid theim, as thoug the killynge of his kynsmen
mighte ende his cause, and make hym kyndely kyng. Where vpon
he sent Ihon Grene, whom he specially trusted, vnto sir Robert Brakē
               bury
constable of the tower, with a letter and credēce also, that the same
sir Roberte in any wyse should put the two childrē to death. This Iohn
Grene dyd his errand to Brakenbury, knelynge before oure lady in the
Towre, who plainly answered that he woulde neuer put them to deathe
to dye therefore. With the which answere Grene returned, recomptyng
the same to kynge Richard at Warwyke yet on his iourney, wherewith
he toke suche displeasure and thoughte that the same nighte he sayde to
a secrete page of his: Ah, whom shall a man truste? they that I haue
brought vp my selfe, they that I went woulde haue moost surely serued
me, euen those fayle me, and at my commaundemente wyll do nothynge
for me. Syr quod the page, there lieth one in the palet chambre with out
that I dare wel say, to do your grace pleasure the thing were right hard
that he would refuse, meanyng this by Iames Tirel, whiche was a man
a goodly personage, and for the giftes of nature worthy to haue serued
a muche better prince, yf he had well serued God▪ and by grace obteyned
to haue as muche trueth and good wyll, as he had strength and wytt.
            The man had an high harte and sore longed vpwarde, not risyng yet so
fast as he had hoped, beynge hindered and kepte vnder by sir Richarde
Ratcliffe and sir Willyam Catesbye, which longyng for no more parteners
of the Princes fauour, namely not for him, whose pride thei knewe
woulde beare no pere, kept him by secrete driftes out of al secrete trust:
whiche thynge this page had well marked and knowen: wherefore, this
occasion offered of very speciall frendship spied his tyme to set him forwarde,
and suche wyse to do hym good, that all the enemies that he had
(except the deuil) could neuer haue done him so muche hurte and shame,
for vpon the pages woordes, kyng Richard arose (for this communicacion
had he sittyng on a drafte, a conuenient carpet for suche a counsail)
and came out into the palet chambre, where he dyd fynde in bed the sayd
Iames Tyrell and sir Thomas Tyrell of persone like and brethren of
bloud, but nothyng of kynne in condicions. Then sayd the kyng merely
to them, what syrs, be you in bed so sone? and called vp Iames Tyrell, &amp;
brake to him secretely his mynd in this mischeuous ma
                  ••
               er, in the which
he found him nothing straunge. Wherfore on the morowe he sent him to
Brakynbury with a letter by the which he was commaunded to delyuer
to the sayd Iames all the keyes of the Towre for a night, to thende that
he might there accomplishe the kynges pleasure in suche thynges as he
there had geuen him in commaundement. After which lettre d

the keyes receyued, Iames appoincted y• next night ensuyng to destroye
them, deuisyng before and preparyng the meanes.
            The prince assone as the Protectour toke vpon hym to be kynge, and
left the name of protectoure, was thereof aduertised and shewed, that he
should not reigne, but his vncle should haue the croune. At which word
the prince sore abashed beganne to sighe and sayd: Alas I would myne
v
                  •
               cle would let me haue my life although I lese my kyngedome. Then
he that tolde hym the tale vsed him with good woordes and put hym in
the best conforte that he coulde, but furthewith he and his brother were
bothe shut vp, and all other remoued from them, one called blacke Wyl,
or Willyam Slaughter onely except, which wer sette to serue them, and
iiii. other to see them sure. After whiche tyme, the prince neuer tyed his
pointes, nor any thyng roughte of hym selfe, but with that young babe
his brother lyngered in thoughte and heuines, tyll this trayterous dede
deliuered them of that wretchednes.
            For Iames Tirrell deuised that they shoulde be murthered in their
beddes, and no bloud shed: to the execution wherof, he appoincted Myles
Forest one of the foure that before kepte them, a felowe fleshe bred in
murther before tyme: and to him he ioyned one Iohn Dighton his awne

him all the maner of the murther, who gaue him great thankes, and as

this poincte, and both they confessed the murther to be done in the same
maner as you haue hard, but whether the bodies were remoued, they bothe
affirmed thei neuer knewe. And thus as I haue learned of them that
muche knewe and litle cause had to lye, where these two noble princes,
these innocente tendre children, borne of the mooste royall bloude and
brought vp in greate wealthe, likely longe to liue, to reigne and rule in

               KYNG Richard by this abommable mischyef &amp; scelerous act▪ thinkyng
hym self well releuyd bothe of feare and thought, would not haue
it kept counsaill, but with in a few daies caused it to ronne in a common
rumor that y• .ii. chyldren were sodanlie dead, and to this entent as it is to

be demyd that now, none heyre male beynge a liue of kynge Edwardes
body lawfully begotten, y• people would be content with the more paciēt
hart, &amp; quiet mynd, to obey hym &amp; suffer his rule and gouernaunce: but
when y• fame of this detestable facte was reueled, &amp; devulged through y•
hole realme, ther fell generally, such a dolor &amp; inwardsorow in to the hartes
of all the people, that all feare of his crueltie set a syde, they in euery
towne, streate, and place openlie wept, and pitiou
                  ••
               ye sobbyd. And when
their sorowe was sumwhat mitigate, ther inwarde grudge could not refrayne
but crye out in plates publike, and also priuate furiously saieng,
what creature of all creatures ys so malicious and so obstinate an enemye
either to God, or to christian religion, or to humayne nature, whiche
woulde not haue abhorred, or at the lest absteyned from so miserable a
murther of so execrable a tirānye. To murther a man is much odious, to
kyll a woman, is in manner vnnaturall, but to slaie and destroye innocent
babes, &amp; young enfantes, the whole world abhorreth, and the bloud
from the earth crieth, for vengaunce to all mightie God. If the common
people cried out, I assure you the frendes of the quene, and her children
made no lesse exclamacion and complainte with loude voyce lamentable
comme crieng and sayenge a las what will he do to other that thus
shamefully murdereth his awne bloud with out cause or desert: whom,
wyll he saue when he slaith the poore lambes committed to him in trust?
now we se and behold y• the most cruel tyranny hath inuadyd the cōmon
wealth, now we se that in him is neither hope of iustice nor trust of mercie
but abundance of crueltie and thrust of innocente bloude. But when
these newes wer first brought to the infortunate mother of the dead children
yet being in sanctuary, no doubte but it strake to her harte, like the
sharpe darte of death: for when she was first enformed of the murther of
her .ii. sonnes, she was so sodainly amasyd with the greatnes of y• crueltie
that for feare she sounded and fell doune to the groūd. And there lay
in a great agonye like to a deade corps. And after that she came to her
memory and was reuyued agayne, she wept and sobbyd and with pitefull
scriches she repleneshyd the hole mancion, her breste she puncted, her
fayre here she 
                  •
               are and pulled in peces &amp; being ouercome with sorowe &amp;
penciuenes rather desyred death then life callyng by name diuers tymes
her swete babes, accomptyng her self more then madde that she deluded
by wyle and fraudulente promyses delyuered her younger sonne out of
the sanctuarie to his enemye to the put to death thinkynge that nexte the
othe made to God brokē, &amp; the dewtie of allegiaunce toward her childrē
violated, she of all creatures in that poyncte was most seduced and disceaued.
After longe lamentacion, when she sawe no hope of reuengynge
otherwyse, she knelyd downe and cried on God to take vengeaunce for
the disceaytfull periurie, as who saide tha she nothyng mystrusted but
once he would remember it. What ys he liuyng that if he remember and
beholde these .ii. noble enfantes with out deseruing, so shamefully murthered,
that wil not abhorre the fact, ye &amp; be moued &amp; tormented with pitie

and mercie. And yet the worlde is so frayle and our nature so blynde
that fewe be sturred with suche examples, obliuiouslie forgettynge, and
littell consyderyng, that oftentimes for the offences by the parentes perpetrate
and committed, that synne is punished in there lyne and posterite.
This chaunce might so happen to this innocēt children, because king
Edward ther father and parent offended in staynyng his conscience: he
made his solempne othe before y• gate of the citie of Yorke (as you haue
harde before) and promised and sware one thing by his worde thinkyng
cleane contrarie in his harte as after dyd appere. And afterward by the
death of the duke of Clarence his brother, he incurred (of likelyehod) the
great displeasure toward God. After this murther this perpetrated and
that he had visited his towne of Gloucester which he for his old dignitie
bothe loued and with ample liberties and priuileges endewed and decorated,
he toke his iorney towarde the countie of Yorke, where the people
abusyng his lawfull fauoure (as he bothe fauoured and trusted them in
his hart) had of late presumed to attempte diuers routes and riottes cō
               trarie
to his lawes and enfryngyng of his peace, and vpon hope of his
mayntenaunce, were so elated that no lord were he neuer of so great power
could either pacifie or rule them tyll the kyng hym selfe came personally
thether to set a concorde and an vnitie in that countree and to bridell
and rule the rude rusticall and blusterynge bolde people of that region,
and so he by long iourneyinge came to the citie of Yorke where the
citezens receyued hym with great pompe and triumphe, accordyng to y•
qualities of their educacion and quantitie of there substaunce and habilitie,
and made diuers daies playes and pageātes in token of ioy and solace.

At the daye appoincted the hole clergie assembled in copes richely
reuested and so with a reuerente ceremonie went aboute the citie in procession,
after whome folowed the king with his croune and scepter appareilled
in his circot robe royall accompaignied with no small nomber of
ye nobilitie of his realme: after whome marched in order quene Anne his
wife likewyse crouned ledinge on her lefte hande Prynce Edwarde her
sonne hauing on his hed a demy crowne appoyncted for the degree of a
prince. The kynge was had in that triumphe in suche honour and y• common
people of the northe so reioysed that they extolled and praysed
hym far aboue the starres. After this solempne feaste and glorious
pompe he kepte greate counsailles there, as well for the orderynge of
the countree in tyme to come, as for the brydellynge and punyshinge
of suche as there had mysgouerned them selfes: and farther of the

gentilmen of that contrie, he augmented the nomber of hys domesticall
ministers &amp; seruauntes, in the which persones he put hys whole trust &amp;
affiaunce. When all thynges were thus discretely ordered, he returned
by Nothynghā, and after came to London: whome more for dread then
for loue, the Cytezens receaued in greate compaygnies. Thus kynge
Richard by a new inuented crueltie and late practised tyrannye obteyned
and grewe to high prayse and honoure, and then by the admiracion
and iudgemente of the common multitude, he was moost estemed
to be exalted in to heauen, when he couertly had intelligēce, that he was
like to lose his estate and could by no meanes haue long contynuaunce
in his v

               lous thunder or terrible
tempest, chansed or were apparantly like to happen: Sodainly the people
hauinge in there freshe memorie the facinorous acte of there kynge
and prince, woulde openly crye and make vocyferacion that God dyd
take vengaunce and punishe the pore Englishemen, for the cryme and
offence of there vngracious kynge, whome they blamed, accursed and
wysshed to haue extreme tortures. Although kynge Richard harde oftē
of this slaunderous wordes and malicious sa
                  •
               ynges and knewe wel by
what persones they were spokē, yet he dirst not with strong hande be on
the fyrste inuentours reuenged, knowinge that some tyme it is no wisedome
to refuse or disdaigne them that tell a ruler his deutie or declare
to hym his mysbehauour toward the common wealthe, or counsaill hym
to amende and chaunge his yll life. After this great felicitie, he fell again
in to a great feare and penciuenes of mynde, and because he coulde by
no meanes either correct or amend thinges that were passed, he determined
by doyng his deutie in al thinges to his commons, to obliterate and
put oute of memorie that note of infamie with the whiche his fame was
iustely spotted and slayned, and to cause the people to co
                  •
               ceyue so good
an opinion in him, that from thēce forth no calamyte nor trouble should
be adiudged to happen to the commō wealth, either by his negligence or
by his mysgouernaunce (althoughe it is difficile and strange shortelie
to tourne and plucke out suche qualities and vsages as haue of longe
tyme ben encorporate in a mans mynde and rooted in his maners and
condicions.) Therfore whether it was for the performaunce of his former
entent of amendement or (as the common fame slew a brode) that he
toke repentaunce of his myscheuous actes and scelerate doynges, he
tourned ouer the leffe, and began an order of a new life, and pretended
to haue the name of a good and vertuous man, bi the reason that he shewed
hym selfe more iuste, more meker, more familiar, more liberall (especially
a mongest the poore people) then before he had accustomed to do,
and so by this meanes he firmelye trusted fyrst to obteyne of god forgeuenes
of his offences and crymes, and after to leuie and take a waie the
enemye and inwarde grudge that the common people bare in their myndes
towarde hym, and in conclusion, to obteigne their frendelye loue

and assured fauour. He farthermore began and enterprised diuers thinges
aswel publike as priuate, the which he beyng preuented by sodayne
deathe dyd neither accomplishe nor bryng to conclusion, for he begon to
founde a college of a hundreth prestes, which foundacion with the founder
shortelye toke an ende. To please the common people also, he in his
high courte of parliamente enacted dyuers and sondrie good lawes and
profitable estatutes and in especiall one againste strangers and foren
wrought wares, not to be transported in to this realme, whiche commodius
acte for the common wealthe yf he had lyued he fullye purposed to
haue auaunsed &amp; fet forwarde &amp; put in execucion. But afterwarde euidentlie
to all persones it appeared, that onely feare (whiche is not a maister
longe in office and in continuall aucthoritie) and not iustice, caused
kynge Rycharde at that verie tyme to waxe better and amende his synnefull
life, for shortelie the goodnes of the man whiche was but payncted
and fraudulent, sodainlie wexed coulde and vanished awaie. And
from thence forth not onely all his counsailles, doynges and procedynges,
sodainlye decayed and sorted to none effecte: But also fortune
beganne to froune and turne her whele douneward from him, in so much
that he lost his onely begotten sonne called Edwarde in the .iii. moneth,
after he had created hym prince of Wales.
            
               ¶The .ii. yere.
               
                  ANd shortely after, The .ii. yere he was vnquieted by
a conspiracye, or rather a confederacye betwene the
duke of Buckyngham and many other gentlemen against,
him as ye shall heare: But ye occasion why the
duke and the kynge fell out, is of diuerse folke diuersely
pretended. This duke as you haue harde before,
assone as y• duke of Gloucester after y• death of kyng
Edwarde was come to Yorke▪ and there had solempne funerall seruice
done for kyng Edward, sent to him a secret seruaunte of his called Persall,
with suche messages as you haue harde before. And after the duke
of Buckyngham came with .CCC. horse to Northampton and still continued
with hym, as partener and chiefe organe of his deuices tyll after
his coronacion, they departed to all semyng very frendes at Gloucester.
From whence assone as the duke came home, he so highly turned
from him and so highly conspired against him, that a man woulde marueill
wherof the chaunge grewe in so shorte space. Some say this occasyon
was, that a litle before the coronacion, the duke required the kynge
amongest other thynges to be restored to the erle of Herfordes landes:
And forasmuche as the tytle whiche he claymed by inheritaunce, was
somewhat interlaced, with the tytle of Lancaster, whiche house made a
title to the croune, and enioyed the same thre discentes, as al men knewe,
tyll the house of Yorke depriued the third kynge, whiche was Henry the
sixte▪ Kynge Richarde somewhat mistrusted and conceiued suche an

indignacion, that he reiected the dukes request, with many spitefull, and
minotary wordes, whiche so wounded the dukes harte with hatred and
mistrust, that he could neuer after endure to loke right on king Richard
but euer feared his awne lyfe, so farre foorth, that when the Protectoure
should ryde to his coronaciō, he feigned hym self sycke, because he would
do hym no honoure. And the other takyng it in euill part, sent him word
to ryse and ryde or he woulde make hym to be caried. Whereupon, gorgeously
apparelled, and sumpteously trapped with burnynge carte naues
of golde embrodered, he roade before the kyng through Londō with
an euill will and woorse harte. And that notwithstandynge, he roase
the daye of the coronacion from the feast, feignyng him selfe sicke, which
kyng Richard sayd was done in hate and spighte of him. And therefore
men sayd that eche of them euer after lyued continually in suche hatred
and dystrust of other, that the duke looked verely to haue bene murthered
at Gloucester, from whiche he in fayre maner departed: but surely
suche as were righte secrete with bothe, affirme all this to be vntrue
and other wyse men thynke it vnlykely, the deepe dissymulyng nature of
bothe these menne well considered. And what nede in that grene worlde
the protectoure had of the duke, and in what perel the duke stoode yf he
fell once in suspicion of that tyraunte, that either the protectour woulde
geue the duke occasyon of displeasure, or the duke the protectour occasion
of mystruste. And surely men thynke, that yf kyng Richard had any
suche opinion conceyued in hym, he woulde neuer haue suffered him to
auoyd his handes or escape his power: but very true it is, that the duke
of Buckyngham was an highe mynded man, and euill coulde beare the
glory of another, so that I haue heard of some that saw it, that he at such
tyme as the corune was set vpon the protectours hed, his eye could neuer
abyde the sight therof, but wryed his hed another way: but men said
he was not well at ease, and that was bothe to kynge. Richard well knowen
and well taken, nor any demaūde of the dukes request vncurteously
reiected, but gently deferred, but bothe he with great giftes and high be
hestes in mooste louynge and trustye maner departed from the kynge to
Gloucester. Thus euery man iudged as he thought, but soone after his
commyng home to Breckenocke, hauyng there by kyng Richardes commaundemēt
doctor Mortō bishop of Ely, who before as you haue haue
harde was taken at the counsaill at the towre, waxed with hym very familier,
whose onely wysedome abused his pride, to his owne deliueraūce
and the dukes distruction. The byshop was a man of greate naturall
witte, very well learned and of honourable behaueour, lackyng no wyse
wayes to wynne fauoure. He was fyrst vpon the parte of kyng Henrye,
whyle that parte was in wealthe, and neither lefte it nor forsoke it in no
woo, but fled the realme with the quene and the prynce. And whyle king
Edward had kynge Henry in prison, he neuer returned but to the felde
at Barnet: After whiche felde lost and vtterly subdued and all parte takynges
extynguished, kyng Edwarde for his fast fayth and wysedome▪
                  
as not onely contente to receyue hym, but also wooed him to come and
had hym from thensforthe bothe in secrete truste and speciall fauoure,
whom he nothynge deceyued. For the beynge after kynge Edwardes
deathe fyrste taken by the tyraunte for his truethe to the kynge, founde
the meane to set the duke in his toppe, and ioyned gentlemen together in
ayde of the earle of Richemonde, whiche after was named kynge Henry
the seuenth: Fyrste deuisyng the mariage betwene the lady Elizabeth
daughter to kynge Edwarde the fourth, by the whiche his faithfull and
true seruice declared to bothe his maisters at once, was an infinitie benefite
to the realme, by the coniunction of the bloudes of Lancaster and
Yorke, whose funerall titles had longe iniquieted the realme. This man
afterwarde escaped from the duke and fled the realme, and neuer returned,
and wente to Rome, neuer myndynge to medle with the worlde, tyll
kynge Henry the seuenth sent for him, and after made hym Archebishop
of Cauntorbury and Chaunceloure of Englande, and after was made
Cardinall, and liued well to all mens iudgementes and died well. But
to retourne to the former purpose, he by the longe and often alternate
proofe, as well of prosperitee as aduerse fortune, had gotten by greate
experience the very mother and mastres of wisedome, and depe insighte
in pollitike &amp; worldly driftes, wherby perceiuyng now the duke to common
with hym, 
                     •
                  ed hym with fayre woordes and many pleasaunte prayses,
and perceiuynge by the grefe of their communicacions the dukes
pryde nowe and then to balke out a litle brayde of enuy toward the glory
of the kynge, and thereby felynge hym easye to fal out yf the matter
were well handeled, he craftely sought the wayes to prycke hym forward
takynge alwayes the occasyon of his commyng, and also kepynge hym
selfe close within his bandes that he rather semed to folowe hym then
to leade hym. For when the duke beganne fyrst to prayse and boast the
kynge and shewe howe muche profite the realme shoulde take by his
reigne: Byshop Morton answered, surely my lorde, folye it were for me
to lye, for I am sure yf I woulde swere the contrarie ye woulde not once
beleue me but yf the worlde woulde haue begone as I would haue wyshed,
that kynge Henries sonne had had the crowne and not kynge Edwarde,
then would I haue bene his true and faithfull 
                     •
                  ubiecte, but after
that God had ordeyned hym to lose it, and kynge Edwarde to reigne, I
was neuer so madde with a dead man to striue against the quick, so was
I euer to kyng Edward a faithfull and true chapeleyn and glad would
haue bene that his children should haue succeded him howbeit yf the secret
iudgemēt of God haue otherwyse prouided, I purpose not to spurne
against the pricke, nor labour to set vp that God pulleth doune. And
as for the late protector and nowe kyng: and with that worde he lefte, sauynge
that he sayd that he had already medled to muche with the world
and would from that day medle with his booke and beades, and no further.
Then longed the duke sore to heare, what he would haue sayde, because
he ended with the kyng, and there so sodaynly stopped, and exhorted

hym familierly, betwene them bothe to be bolde and to saye whatsoeuer
he thoughte, whereof he faithefully promised there shoulde neuer
come hurte, and paraduenture more good then he woulde wene. And
that he hym selfe entended to vse his faithefull secrete aduice and counsayle,
whiche he sayd was the onely cause for the whiche he procured of
the kynge to haue hym in his custodye, where he might recon hym felf at
home, or els he had bene put in the handes of them with whom he should
not haue founde like fauour. The byshoppe right humblie thanked him
and sayd, in good faythe my lorde, I loue not muche to talke of princes
as of a thyng not all out of perell, although the word be without faute,
but yet it must be as it pleaseth y• prince to construe it. And euer I thinke
on Isopes tale, y• when the Lyon had proclaymed that on paine of death
there shoulde no horned beastes come into the woode, one beast that had
a bonche of fleshe growyng out of his heade, fled a greate pace: the Foxe
that sawe hym flye with all the hast, asked hym whether he fled? In faith
quod he, I neither wote ne recke, so I were once hence, because of the proclamacion
made against horned beastes. What foole quod the foxe, the
Lyon neuer ment it by the, for that whiche thou haste is no horne in thy
heade. No mary quod he, I wote that well ynough, but yf he say it is a
horne, where am I then? The duke laughed merely at the tale and said,
my lorde I warraunte you, neither the Lyon nor the bore shall pycke
any matter at any thynge here spoken, for it shall neuer come nere their
eares. In good faith, syr sayd the byshop, yf it dyd, the thyng that I was
aboute to say taken aswell as before God I mente, it coulde deserue but
thanke, and yet taken as I wene it woulde, might happen to turne me to
lytle good and you to lesse.
               Then longed the duke muche more to wete what it was, whereupon
the bishop sayd. In good faith my lorde, as for the late protectoure, sith
he is nowe kyng in possession I purpose not to dispute his title, but for y•
wealthe of this realme, whereof his grace hath nowe the gouernaunce,
and whereof I my self am a poore membre, I was aboute to wishe that
to those good abilities wherof he hath alredy right many, litle neadyng
my prayse, yet might it haue pleased God for the better store to haue geuen
hym some of suche other excellente vertues mete for the rule of the
realme, as our lord hath planted in the person of youre grace, and there
lefte of agayne. The duke somewhat maruelynge at his sodaine pauses
as though thei were but parentheses, with a high coūtenaunce saied:
my lorde I euidentelye perceyue and no lesse note your often breathyng
and sodayne stoppynge in your cōmunicacion, so that to my intelligence
your wordes neither come to any dyrect or perfect sentence in conclusiō,
wherby either I myght perceyue and haue knowlege what your inward
entent is now toward the kyng, or what affection you beare toward me.
For the comparyson of good qualities ascribed to vs bothe (for the whiche
I my selfe knowlege and recognise to haue none, nor loke for no
prayse of any creature for the same) maketh me not a lyttell to muse

thynkynge that you haue some other preuie Imaginacion, by loue
or by grudge engraued and emprinted in your harte, whiche for feare
you dare not or for childeshe shamefastnes you be abashed to disclose
and reuele, and especially to me beynge your frende, whiche on my honoure
do assure you to be as secrete in this case as the deffe and dumme
person is to the singer, or the tree to the hunter. The byshoppe beynge
somewhat boulder, consyderynge the dukes promyse, but moste of all
ammated and encouraged because he knewe the duke desyerous to be
exalted and magnified, and also he perceyued the inwarde hatred and
pryuie rancor whiche he bare towarde kyng Richarde, was nowe bol
                     •
                  ened
to open his stomacke euē to the very bottome, entendyng thereby to
compasse howe to destroye and vtterly confounde kynge Richarde, and
to depryue hym of his dignitee royall, or els to sett the Duke so a fyer
with the desyer of ambicion, that he hym selfe might bee safe and escape
out of all daunger and perell, whiche thinge he brought shortely to conclusion
bothe to the kynges destruction and the dukes confusion and
to his awne sauegarde, and fynally, to his high promocion. And so (as
I sayed before) vpon truste and confidence of the dukes promyse, the
bishoppe saiede: my synguler good lorde sithe the tyme of my captiuitee,
whiche beynge in your graces custodie I maye rather call it a liberall
libertie more them a straight emprysonmente, in a voydynge ydelnes
mother and norissher of all vices, in redynge bookes and aunciente
pamphlettes I haue found this sentence wrytten, that no man is borne
fre and in libertie of hym selfe onely, for one parte of duetie he oweth or
shoulde owe to his parentes for his procreacion by a very naturall instincte
and filiall curtesie: another parte, to his frendes and kynsfolke,
for proximitie of bloude and naturall amitie dothe of verie dewtie
chalenge and demaunde: But the natiue countrye in the which he tasted
fyrste the swete ayers of this pleasaunte and flatterynge worlde after
his natiuitie, demaūdeth as a debt by a natural bonde neither to be forgotten
nor yet to be put in obliuion, whiche saiynge causeth me to consider
in what case this realme my natiue countrye now standeth, and in
what estate and assueraunce before this tyme it hathe contynued: what
gouernour we now haue, and what ruler we myghte haue, for I plainely
perceyue the realme beynge in this case muste nedes decaye and be
broughte to vtter confusion and fynall exterminion: But one hope I
haue encorporate in my breaste, that is, when I consider and in my
mynde do diligentely remember, and dayly beholde youre noble personage,
your iustice▪ and indifference, your 
                     •
                  eruente zele and ardente loue
towarde your
natural contrey, and in lyke maner y• loue of your contrie
towarde you, the greate learnynge, pregnaunte witte and goodly eloquence,
whiche so muche dothe abounde in the persone of youre grace,
I muste nedes thynke this realme fortunate, ye twyse more then fortunate,
whiche hath suche a prynce in store, mete and apte, to be a gouernoure

in whose persone beynge endued with so many princelye qualities
consisteth and resteth the very vndoubted similitude and image of
trew honoure. But on the other syde when I call to memorie the good
qualites of the late protectour and nowe called kynge, so violated and
subuerted by tyrannie, so thaunged, &amp; altered by vsurped aucthoritee, so
clouded and shadowed by blynde and infaciable ambicion, ye and so sodainlye
(in maner by a metamorphosis) transformed from politike ciuilitie,
to detestable tyrannie: I must nedes saie and iustlie affirme, that he
is neither mete to be a kynge of so noble a realme, nor so famous a realme
mete to be gouerned by suche a tyraunte: Was not his firste interprise
to obtaine the crowne begonne and incepted by the murther of dyuers
noble valiaunt trewe and vertuous personages: O a holy begynnyng
to come to a myscheuous endyng, dyd he not secondarelie procede
contrarie to al lawes of honestie, shamefully agaynst his awne naturall
mother, beyng a womā of much honour, and more vertew, declaryng her
openlie to be a woman geuen to carnall affection, and dissolute liuinge
(whiche thynge yf it had bene trewe as it was not in dede, 
                     •
                  uery good
and naturall childe would haue rather mummed at, then to haue blasted
a broade and especially she beyng a lyue.) Declarynge farthermore hys
ii. brethren and his .ii. nephewes to be bastardes &amp; to be borne in auoutrey,
yet not whith all this contente. After that he had obteyned the garlande
for the whiche he so longe thristed, he caused the two poore innocēs
his nephewes committed to hym, for especiall truste, to be murthered
and shamefully to be kylled. The bloud of whiche sely and lyttel babes
dayly crye to God, from the earthe for vengaunce. Alas my
harte sobbith, to remember this bloudy boutcher and cruel monster,
what suretie shall be in this realme to any person, other for life or goodes
vnder suche a cruell prynce, whyche regardeth not the destruction
of his awne bloude, and then lesse the losse of other. And most especially
as oftentymes it chaunceth, where a couetous or a cruell prince taketh
suspicion, the smaleste, swaruynge that is possible (yf the thynge be
mysconstered) maye be the cause of the destruction of many gyltles persones:
and in especiall of noble and wealthy personages hauynge
greate possessions and riches: Suche a lorde is Lucifer when he is entred
into the harte of a proude prynce, geuen to couetousnes and
crueltie. But nowe my Lorde to conclude what I meane towarde
your noble persone, I saye and affirme, yf you loue God, your lynage,
or youre natyue contrye, your muste yower selfe take vpon you the
Crowne and Diademe of this noble empyre, bothe for the mayntenauns
of the honoure of the same (whiche so longe hath floreshed in
fame and renowne) as also for the delyueraunce of youre naturall
countrey men, from the bondage and thraldome (worse then the captiuitie
of Egypte) of so cruell a tiraunt and arrogante oppressor. For thus
I dare saye, yf any foren prynce or potentate, ye the Turcke hym

selfe woulde take vppon hym the regiment here and the crowne, the commons
woulde rather admit and obey hym, then to lyue vnder suche
a bloud supper and child kyller: but how muche more ioyfull and glad
would they be to lyue vnder your grace, whome they all knowe to be a
ruler mete and conuenient for them, and they to be louing and obedient
subiectes mete to lyue vnder suche a gouernour: dispise not, nor forsake
not so manifeste occasion so louingly offered. And yf you your self knowing
the payne and trauaill that apperteyneth to the office of a kynge,
or for any other consideracion, will refuse to take vpon you the crowne
and scepter of this realme: Then I adiure you by ye faithe that you owe
to God, by youre honoure and by your othe made to Saincte George
patron of the noble ordre of the gartier (whereof you be a compaignion)
and by the loue and affection that you beare to your natiue contrey and
the people of the same, to deuise some waie how this realme now being
in miserie may by your high discrecion and pryncely policie, be brought
and reduced to some suertie and conueniente regiment vnder some good
gouernour by you to be excogitate: for you are ye verye patron, the only
helpe, refuge, and conforte for the poore amased and desolate commons
of this realme. For yf you could either deuise to sett vp again the linage
of Lancaster or auaunce the eldest doughter of kynge Edward to some
highe and puyssaunte prince, not onely the newe crowned kynge shall
smal tyme enioy the glorie of his dignitie, but also al ciuile warr should
cease, all domesticall discorde should slepe, and peace, profite and quietnies
should be set forth and embrased. When the bishoppe had thus ended
his saiyng, ye duke sighed and spake not of a greate while, which sore
abashed the bishop and made hym chaunge couler: which thing when the
duke apperceiued, he saide, be not afrayde my lorde, all promyses shall
be kept, to morow we wyl cōmon more: let vs go to supper, so that night
they commoned no more, not a litle to the iniquietacion of the bishoppe,
whiche nowe was enen as desirous to knowe the dukes mynde and entent,
as the duke longed the daye before to knowe his opinion and meanyng.
So the nexte daie, the duke sente for the byshoppe and rehersed to
hym in maner (for he was bothe wyttie and eloquente) all the communicacion
had betwene them before, and so paused a while, and after a lytle
ceason puttyng of his bonett he sayde: O lorde God creator of all thinges
howe muche is this realme of Englande and the people of the same
bounden to thy goodnes, for where we now be in vexacion and trouble
with greate stormes oppressed sayling and tossyng in a desperate shippe
without good maister or gouernour: but by thy healp good lord I trust
or long tyme passe that we shall prouyde for such a ruler as shalbe both
to thy pleasure, and also to the securite and sauegarde of this noble realme.
And then he put on his bonett saiyng to the byshoppe, my lord of
Ely whose trewe harte and syncere affeccion towarde me at all tymes, I
haue euidentlie perceyued and knowen, and nowe moste of all in our last
preuie cōmunicacion and secrete deuisynge, I must nedes in hart thinke

and with mouthe confesse and saie; that you be a sure frende, a trustye
counsailour, a vigilante foresear, a very louer of your countrey, a naturall
countreyman: for whiche kyndnes for my parte, I moste louinglye
render to you my hartye thankes nowe with wordes: hereafter trustyng
to recompence and remunerate you with dedes, yf life and power
shall serue. And sithe at oure last communicacion, you haue disclosed,
and opened, the very secretes and priuities of your stomacke, touchinge
the duke of Gloucester nowe vsurper of the crowne, and also haue a littel
touched the auauncemēt of the .ii. noble famelyes of Yorke &amp; Lācaster:
I shall likewyse not onely declare and manifeste vnto you, all my
open actes, attemptes and doynges, but also my preuie ententes, and secrete
cogitacions. To the entent that as you haue vnbuckeled your bogett
of your preuie meanynges, and secrete purposes to me: so shall all
my clowdy workynge, close deuises, and secrete imaginacions, be (as
clere as the some) reueled, opened, and made lightesome to you. And to
beginne, I declare: that when kynge Edwarde was disseaced, to whome
I thought my selfe littell or nothynge beholden, (all thoughe we .ii. had
maried two systers) because, he neither promoted nor preferred me, as
I thoughte I was worthy &amp; had deserued, nether fauored nor regarded
me, accordynge to my degree and byrthe: For surely I had by hym
lytle aucthoritee, and les
                     •
                  e rule, and in effecte nothynge at all: which
caused me the lesse to fauor his chyldren, because I founde small humanitie,
or none in there par
                     •
                  nte. I then beganne to studie, and with
mature, deliberacion, to ponder and consyder, howe &amp; in what maner this
re
                     •
                  lme shoulde be ruled and gouerned. And fyrste I remembred an
olde prouerbe worthy of memorye, that often ruithe the realme, where
chyldren rule, and women gouerne. This olde adage so sanke, and
settelled in my heade, that I thought it a great errour, and extreme myschyefe
to the hole realme, either to suffer the younge kynge to rule, or
the qu
                     •
                  ne his mother to be a gouernour ouer hym, consyderynge that
her brethrene, and her fyrst chyldren (all thoughe they were not extracte
of highe and noble lynage) toke more vpon them, and more exalted
them selues by reason of the quene, then dyd the kynges brethrene, or
any duke in his realme: Which in conclusion turned to there confusion.
Thē I beinge persuaded whith my self in this poyncte, thought it necessarie
bothe for the publique and profitable welthe of this realme, and
also for myne awne commoditie and emolumente, to take parte with thee
duke of Eloucester: Whome I assure you I thoughte to be as cl
                     •
                  ane
withoute dissimulacion, as tractable withoute iniurie, as mercifull withoute
crueltie, as nowe I knowe hym perfectely to be a dissembler withoute
veritie, a tyraunte withoute petie, yea, and worse then the tyraunte
phaleres, destitute of all trutghe and clemencie: And so by my meanes,
at the fyrste counsaill holden at London, when he was most suspected of
that thynge that after happened, (as you my lorde knowe well ynough)
he was made Protectoure and defender, bothe of the kynge and of the

realme, whiche aucthorite once gotten, and the two chyldren partelie by
policie broughte vnder his gouernaunce, he beynge moued with that
gnawynge and couetous serpēt, desyered to reigne and neuer ceased priuelie
to exhorte and require (yea &amp; some tymes with minatorie termes)
to persuade me and other lordes aswell spirituall as temporall, that he
myghte take vpon hym the crowne, tyll the prynce came to the age of
foure and twenty yeres, and were able to gouerne the realme, as a mature
and sufficiente kynge: Whiche thynge when he sawe me somewhat
stycke at, both for the straungenes of the example (because no such presidente
had bene sene) and also because we remembred that men once ascended
to the highest type of honour and aucthoritee wil not gladlie discende
agayn, he then brought in instrumētes, autentike doctours, proctoures,
and notaries of the lawe, with deposicions of diuers wytnesses,
testifieng kyng Edwards children to be bastardes, which deposiciōs
then I thought to be as trewe, as now I knowe them to be fayned, and
testifyed by persones with rewardes vntruelye subornate. When the
saide deposicions were before vs redde and diligently harde, he stoode
vp bare hedded saiyng: Wel my lordes, euen as I &amp; you sage &amp; discrete
counsailers woulde that my nephewe shoulde haue no wronge: So I
praie you do me nothynge but righte. For these witnesses and saiynges
of famous doctors being trew▪ I am onely the vndubitate heire to lord
Richard plantagenet duke of Yorke, adiudged to be the very heire to
the crowne of this realme by aucthoritee of parliamente, whiche thinges▪
so by learned men to vs for a verite declared, caused me and other
to take him for our lawfull and vndoubted prince and souereigne lord.
For well we knew y• the duke of Clarence sonne, by reason of the attaynder
of his father was disabled to inherite, and also y• duke hym self was
named to be a bastarde, as I my selfe haue harde spoken, and that vpon
greate presumpcions more tymes then one: so agayn by my ayde and fauour,
he of a protectour was made a kyng, and of a subiecte made a gouernour,
at which tyme he promysed me on his fidelite, laiyng his hand
in myne at Baynarde Castel, that the .ii. young princes should lyue, and
that he would so prouide for them and so mayntaine them in honorable
estate▪ ye I and all the realme ought and should be content. But when he
was once crouned king, and in full possession of the hole realme he cast a
way his old cōdicions as y• adder doeth her skynne, verefieng y• old prouerbe,
honoures chaunge maners, as the parishe prest remembreth that
he was neuer parishe clerck. For when I my self sued to him for my part
of the Earle of Ha
                     ••
                  fordes landes whiche his brother kynge Edwarde
wrongefully de
                     •
                  eyned and with helde from me, and also required
to haue the office of the highe constable shyppe of Englande, as diuers
of my noble anunceters before this tyme haue had, and in longe
discente continued. In thys my fyrst suyte shewynge his good mynde
towarde me, he dyd not onely fyrste delaye me, and afterwarde denay
me, but gaue me suche vnkynde woordes, with suche tauntes and

retauntes ye in maner checke and checke mate to the vttermooste profe
of my pacience. As though I had neuer furthered him but hyndered him
as though I had put hym downe and not sett hym vp: yet all these vngratitudes
and vndeserued vnkyndnes I bare closlye &amp; suffered pacientelie
and couertly remembred, owtwardely dissimulynge that I inwardelie
thoughte, and so with a payncted countenaunce I passed the laste
summer in his last compaignie, not withoute many faier promyses, but
withoute any good dedes. But when I was credibly enformed of the
death of the .ii. younge innocentes, his awne natural nephewes contrarie
to his faith and promyse, to the whiche God be my iudge I neuer agreed
nor condiscended. O lord, how my veynes panted, howe my body
trembled, and my harte inwardely grudged, in so much that I so abhorred
the sighte and muche more the compaignie of hym, that I coulde no
lenger abyde in his courte, excepte I shoulde be openly reuenged. The
ende wherof was doutfull, and so I fayned a cause to departe, and with
a mery countenaunce and a dispiteful harte I toke my leaue humbly of
hym (he thinkyng nothynge lesse then that I was displeased) and so returned
to Brecknock to you. But in y• iourney as I returned whyther it
were by the inspiracion of the holy ghost, or by Melancolous disposiciō,
I had diuers and sundrie imaginacions howe to depriue this vnnatural
vncle, and bloudy butcher, from his royall seate, and princely dignitie.
Fyrst I fantesyed that yf I list to take vpon me the croune, and imperiall
scepter of the realme, now was the tyme propice and conuenient.
For nowe was the waie made plaine, and the gate opened, and occasiō
geuen▪ whiche now neglected, should paraduenture neuer take suche effecte
and conclusion. For I sawe he was disdaigned of the lordes temporall
execrate and accursed of the lordes spiritual, detested of all gentilmen,
and despised of all the communaltie: So that I saw my chaunce
as perfectely as I sawe my awne Image in a glasse, that there was no
person (y

                   had ben gredy to attempte the enterprise) could nor should
haue wone the ryng, or gott the gole before me. And on this poyncte I
rested in imaginacion secretely wt my self .ii. daies at Tewkesberie. And
from thence so iornyeng I mused &amp; thought y• it was not best nor cōueniēt
to take vpō me as a cōquerour, for then I knewe that all mē &amp; especially
the nobilitee, would with all their power with stande me, bothe for
rescuyng of possessions &amp; tenours, as also for subuertyng of ye hole estat
lawes and customes of the realme: Suche a power hathe a conquerour
as you knowe well ynough my lord. But at the last, in all is doutfull
case ther sprange a new braunche out of my hed, which suerly I thought
should haue broughte forthe 
                     •
                  ayer flowers, but the sonne was so hotte
that they turned to drye wedes, for I sodainly remembred that lord Edmond
duke of Somersett my grandfather was with kynge Henrye the
sixte in the .ii. and .iii. degrees from Ihon duke of Lancaster lawefully
begotten: So that I thought sure my mother being eldest doughter to
duke Edmonde, that I was nexte heyre to kynge Henry the syxte of the

house of Lancaster. This title pleased well suche as I made priuye
of my counsaill, but muche more it encorraged my foulishe desyer, and
eleuated my ambicious entente, in so muche that clerely iudged, and in
myne awne mynd was determynath resolued, ye I was indubitate heyre,
of the house of Lancaster, and there vpon concluded, to make my fyrst
foundacion, and crecte my newe buyldinge. But whyther God so ordeyned,
or by fortune it so chaunced, while I was in a ma

we had commoned a litle concernyng her sonne, as I shal shewe you after,
and were departed, she to oure ladie of worceter, and I towarde
Shrewsberie: I then newe chaunged and in maner amased, began to
dispute with my selfe, title considerynge that thus my earnest was turned
euen to a tittyl not so good as, estamen. Estsones I imagened whyther

commonaltie, whiche me thoughte easy to be done, the vsurpor kynge
thus beynge in hatred and abhorred of this hole realme▪ or to take it
by power, whiche standeth in fortunes chaunce and difficle to be acheued
and broughte to passe. Thus romblynge and tossynge, in the waues
ambiguitie, betwene the stone and sacrafice, I considered fyr

                  e the office,

                  pecially
appoyncted by God as kynge Dauid and diuers other haue been.
               But farther I remembred that yf I once toke on me the

                  cepter, and
the gouernaunce of the realme: That of two extreme enemies I was

Edwarde and there alies, and frendes, whiche be no small nomber,
beynge bothe, for his sake muche beloued, and also for the greate iniurie
and manifeste tyrannye done to them, by the newe vsurper, muche
lamented, and pitied, woulde neuer cease to barcke yf they cannot
byte at the one syde of me. Semblable, my cousyne therle of Rychemonde,

or deposicion. And yf the said .ii. linages of Yorke and Lancaster, which
so longe haue stryued for the imperiall Diademe should ioyne in one against
me, then were I suerly mated and the game gotten. Wherefore I
haue clerely determined, and with my selfe cōcluded, vtterly to relinquishe
all suche fantasticall imaginacions concernynge the obteynynge of
the croune. But al such plagues, calamities and troubles (which I feared
and suspected) myght haue chanced on me yf I had taken the rule &amp;

Humfrey, whiche was sworne brother to her father, to moue the kynge
to be good to her sonne Henry erle of Richemōd, and to licence him with
his fauor to returne again into England: and yf it were his pleasure so
to do, she promised that the erle her sonne should mary one of kyng Edwardes
daughters at the appoinctement of the kyng, without any thing
to be taken or demaunded for the saide espousals, but onely the kynges

                  e ouer passed and gaue her fayre wordes &amp;
so departed. But after in my lodgyng, when I called to memorie with a
deliberate studie &amp; dyd circumspectely ponder them. I fully adiudged ye
the holy ghoste caused her to moue a thynge (the ende wherof she coulde
not consider) bothe for the securitie of the realme as also for the prefermente
of her childe and the destruction and finall confusion of the common
enemye kyng Richarde. Whiche thing, she neither then thought I
am sure as I by her wordes coulde make coniecture, nor I my selfe cast
not her desyer to be so profitable to the realme as I now do perceiue, but
suche a lord is God, that with a litle sparcle he kyndelith a great fyer, &amp;
so fynally to declare to you the very conclusion, to the which I am both
bent and sette, my mynde is and my power and purse shall helpe, that y•
erle of Richemond very heyre of the house of Lancaster (in the querell of
the which linage, both my father and grand father lost ther lyues in battayle)
shal take to wi
                     •
                  e lady Elizabeth eldest daughter to kyng Edward
by the whiche mariage bothe the houses of the Yorke and Lancaster maye
be obteyned and vnite in one, to the clere stablyshement of the title to the
crowne of this noble realme. To which conclusion yf the mothers of bothe
parties, and especially the erle hym selfe, and the ladye wyll agre, I
doubte not but the braggynge bore, which with his tuskes raiseth euery
mans skyn, shall not onely be brought to confusion as he hath deserued
but that this empire shall euer be certaine of an vndubitate heyre, and
then shall all ciuile and intestyne war cease, whiche so longe hath contynued
to the paring of many mēs crownes, and this realme shalbe reduced
agayne to quietnes renoune and glorie. This inuencion of the duke
many men thought after, that it was more imagened for the inward hatred

that he bare to kynge Rycharde, then for any fauor that he bare to
the erle of Rychemond. But of such doubtfull matter, it is not best to
iudge for erryng to farre from the mynde and entent of the auctor: But
whatsoeuer he entended, this deuice once opened to kyng Rychard was
the very occasion, ye he was rounded shorter by the whole head, without
attaynder or iudgement. When the duke had sayd, the bishop, which fauored
euer the house of Lancaster, was wonderous ioyfull, and muche
reioysed to here this deuice, for nowe came the wynde about euen as he
would haue it, for all hys imaginaciō tēded to this effect to haue kyng
Richard subdued, &amp; to haue y• lynes of king Edward, &amp; kyng Hēry ye .vi.
again raysed and auaunsed. But lord how he reioysed to thynke how ye
by this mariage the linages of Yorke &amp; Lancaster should be conioyned

                  nes of the publique wealthe of this realme.
And lest the dukes courage should swage, or hys mynd should agayne
alter, as it did oftē before, as you may easely perceiue by hys awne tale.
He thought to set vp all the sayles that he had, to the entent that ye ship

                  arie to consider, what personages
and what frendes we shall fyrste make preuie of this high deuice
and polliticke conclusion. By my truthe quod the duke we wyll begyne
with my ladye of Rychemonde therles mother whiche knowethe where
he is, either in captiuitie or at large in Brytaine. For I harde 
                     •
                  aie that y•
duke of Brytaine restored him to libertie immediately after the death of
kyng Edward, by whose meanes he was restrayned. Syth yow wyl begyn
that way (said y• byshop) I haue an old frend with ye countesse, a mā
sobre, secrete, &amp; well wytted, called Reignold Bray whose prudēt pollicie
I haue knowē to haue cōpassed thīges of great importaūce, for whom
I shall secretly send yf it be your pleasure, &amp; I doubt not he wyll gladly
come, &amp; y• with a good wyll. So with a lyttel diligence, the byshop wrote
a letter to Reignold Bray requyrynge hym to come to Brecknocke wit
                     •
                  
spede for great and vrgente causes touchynge his maistresse: &amp; no other
thing was declared in the letter. So the messenger rode into Lancashire
where Bray was with the coūtesse &amp; lord Thomas Stanley her husbād,
&amp; deliuered the letter, which when he had red, 
                     •
                  e toke it as a signe or presage
of some good fortune to come, &amp; so with y• messenger he came to the
Castel 
                     •
                  f Brecknock, where y• duke and the byshop declared what thing
was deuised both for to set y• realme in a quiet stedefastnes, as also for y•
high preferment of y• earle of Richemond sonne to his lady &amp; maistresse:
Wyllyng her fyrst to cōpasse how to obteyne y• good wyll of quene Elizabeth,
&amp; also of her eldest daughter bearing y• same name: &amp; after secretl
                     •
                  
to send to her sonne into Britaine to declare what high honour was prepared
for hym if he would sweare to mary y• lady Elizabeth assone as he
was kyng &amp; in royal possession of the realme. Reignold Bray wt a glad

hast for gettyng nothing geuen to hym in charge in great hast and with
good sped retourned to the countesse his lady and mastresse. Whē Bray
was departed &amp; this great doutfull vessell once sett a broche, the bishop
thrustyng for nothing more then for lybertie: whē he sawe the duke pleasaunt
and well mynded, towarde hym tolde the duke that yf he were in
his yle of Elye he coulde make many frendes to ferther ther enterpryse,
and yf he were ther and had but .iiii. daies warnyng he lyttell regarded
the malice of kyng Richard, his country was so strong. The duke knew
well all this to be trew, but yet lothe he was that the byshop shoulde departe,
for he knewe well that as longe as the bishoppe, was with him, he
was sure of politique aduise, sage counsayl, and circumspect proceding.
And so he gaue the byshop fayre wordes, saiyng that he should shortely
departe and that well accompaigned for feare of enemyes. The byshop
beiyng as wyttye as the duke was wylie, dyd not tarie tyl y• dukes compaignie
were assembled, but secretlie disguysed in a nyghte departed (to
the dukes great displeasure) and came to his see of Ely, where he founde
monye and frendes and so sailed into Flaunders, where he dyd the earle
of Richemonde good seruice and neuer retourned agayne tyll the earle
of Richemoude after beyinge, kyng sent for hym, and shortely promoted
hym to the see of Cauntorbury. Thus the bishoppe wound hym self frō
the duke when he had moste nede of his ayde, for yf he had taried still y•
duke had not made so many blabbes of his counsaill, nor put so muche
confidens in the Welshemen, nor yet so temerariously set forwarde with
oute knowlege of his frendes as he dyd, whiche thynges were his sodanie
ouerthrowe as they that knewe it dyd reporte.
               When Reignold Bray had declared his message, and preuie instruction
to the countesse of Richemonde his maftres, no meruell though she
were ioyous and glad, both of the good newes and also for y• obteynyng
of suche a high frende in her sonnes cause as the duke was, wherfore she
wyllyng not to slepe this matter, but to farther it to the vttermost of her
power &amp; abilitie, deuised a meanes howe to breake is matter to quen
                     •
                  
Elizabeth then being in sanctnarie at Westminster. And there vpon she
hauynge in her familie, at that tyme for the preseruacion of her healthe
a certayne Welsheman called Lewes learned in phisicke, whiche for his
grauitie and experiens, was well knowen and muche estemed amongest
great estates of the realme: with whome she vsed somtyme liberally and
familiarlye to talke, nowe hauynge opportunitie and occasion to breake
her mynde vnto him of this weightie matter, declared that the tyme was
come that her sonne shoulde be ioyned in mariage with lady Elizabeth
daughter &amp; heyre to kyng Edward, and that king Richard beyng takē &amp;
reputed of all men for the cōmon enemye of the realme, shoulde out of all
honour and estate be deiected, and of his rule and kyngedome be clerely
spoyled &amp; expulsed: and required hym to goo to quene Elizabeth (with
home in his facultie he was of counsaill) not as a messenger, but as one
that came frendelie to visite and consolate her, and as tyme and place

should require to make her preuie of this deuise, not as a thīg cōcluded,
but as a purpose by him imagened. This phisician dyd not long lynger
to accomplishe her desyre, but with good diligens repaired to the quene
being still in the sanctuary at Westminster. And when he saw tyme propice

houre bothe arriued in the duke of Britaynes courte and spake with the
erle of Richemond, which from the deathe of kyng Edward went at his

coulde neuer haue taken any effecte withoute the helpe and prefermente

                  WHerupon the erle wt all diligence sent into England agayn
Hugh conwey and Thomas Rame, whiche shoulde declare
his commynge shortely into Englande, to thentent that all
thinges whiche by councell might be for his purpose prouided,
shoulde be accelerate and hasted, and that all thynges
doubtfull shoulde of his frendes be prudently forseen, in aduoydyng al
engins and snares which kyng Richard had or might haue set in disturbaūce
of his purpose, and he in the meane ceason would make his abode
still in Brytayne, till al thinges necessary for his iorney were prepared
and brought in aredynes.
               In, the meane ceason the cheuetaynes of the coniuracion in Englande
began together many entreprises: Some in conueniente fortresses
put strong garrisons: Some kepte armed men preuely, to thentente
when they should haue knowlege of the erles landynge, thei would
begynne to sturre vp the warre: Other dyd secretely moue and sollicite
the people to rise and make an insurrecion: Other (emongeste whome
Ihon Morton bishop of Ely then beynge in Flaunders was chefe) by
peruie letters and cloked messengers, dyd sturre and inuite to this newe
coniuracion, al such which they certeynely knewe to haue a roted hatred

or to beare a cankard malice toward kyng Richard &amp; his procedynges.
               Although this greate entreprice were neuer so preuely handeled and
so secretely emongeste so circumspecte persones treated, compassed and
conueyghed, yet knowlege therof came to the eares of kynge Richard,
whiche with the

                  quyer was

preserued from all daungier and perell in this troubleous worlde, gathered
together a greate bande of men in Yorkeshire. Sir Edwarde
Courtney and Peter his brother bishop of Exsetter, reised another army
in deuoushire and cornewall. In kente, Richarde Guylforde and
other gentlemen, collected a great companye of souldyoures and openly
beganne warre. But kynge Richarde whiche in the meane tyme had
gotten together a greate strengthe and puissaunce, thynkynge yt not
moost for his parte beneficiall to disparse and deuyde his greate armye
into small branches, and particulerely to persecute any one of the coniuracion
by hym selfe, determined all other beynge set asyde, with hys
whole puyssaunce to set on the chiefe hed whiche was the duke of Buckyngham.
And so remouynge from London, he tooke his iourney
towarde Salsburie, to thentente that in his iourney he mighte set on
the dukes army yf he myghte knowe hym in any place encamped or in

why they lefte hym desolate and cowardely forsooke hym. The

in army with the courtneys and other Westernmen of his confideracy
and affinite, which if he had done, no doubt but kyng Richard had
bene in greate ieopardie either of priuacion of his realme or losse of his
life or both. But se the chaūce, before he could attayne to Seuerne side,
by force of continuall rayne and moysture, the ryuer rose so high that yt
ouerflowed all the countrey adioyning, in somuch that men were drowned
in their beddes, howses with the extreme violence were ouerturned,
childrē were caried aboute the feldes, swymmynge in cradelles, beastes
were drowned on hilles, whiche rage of water lasted continually .x. dayes,
in somuche that in the countrey adioynyng they call yt to this daie,
the greate water, or the duke of Buckynghams greate water. By this
innudacion the passages were so closed that neither the duke could come
ouer Seuerne to his complices, nor they to hym, durynge the whiche
tyme, the Welshemen lyngerynge ydely and without money, vitayle, or
wages, sodaynely scaled and departed: and for all the dukes faire promyses, manaces and enforcementes, they woulde in no wise neither goo
farther nor abide. The duke thus abandoned and left almost post alone
was of necessite cōpelled to flye, and in his flight was with this sodeyne
oif fortune meruelousely dismayed: and beinge vnpurueyed, what councell
he shoulde take and what waie he shoulde folowe, like a man in dispeire
not knowynge what to do, of verie truste and confidence conueyghed
hym selfe into the house of Homfrey Banaster his seruaunt beside

shrewsburie, whome he had tendrely broughte vp, &amp; whome he aboue all

or of any of his confederacyon, adherentes, fautoures or partakers.
               While this Busy searche was diligentely applied and put in execucion,
Homfrey Banaster (were it more for feare of losse of lyfe and goodes,
or attracted and prouoked by the auaricious desire of the thousande
poundes) he bewrayed his gest and master to Ihon Mitton
then shriefe of shropshire, whyche sodaynely with a stronge power of
men in harnes apprehended the duke in a lytle groue adioynynge to
the mansion of Homfrey Banaster, and in greate hast and euyll spede
conueighed him appareled in a pilled blacke cloke to the cytie of Salsburie
where kynge Richarde then kepte his housholde.
               Whether this Banaster bewreyed the duke more for feare then couetous
many men do doubt: but sure it is, that shortlie after he had betrayed
ye duke his master, his sonne and heyre waxed mad and so dyed in a
bores stye, his eldest daughter of excellent beautie was sodaynelie stryken
with a foule leperye, his seconde sonne very meruelously deformed
of his limnes and made decrepite, his younger sonne in a small puddel
was strāgled &amp; drouned, &amp; he beyng of extreme age arraigned &amp; foūd
gyltie of a murther and by his clergye saued. And as for is thousande
pounde kyng Richard gaue him not one farthing, saiyng that he which
would be vntrew to so good a master would be false to al other, howbeit
some saie ye he had a smal office or a ferme to stoppe his mouthe with al.
The duke beyng by certayne of the kynges councel diligently vpon interrogatories
examined what thynges he knewe preiudicial to ye kynges
person, opened and declared frankely and frely all the coniuracion with
out dissimulynge or glosynge, trustynge because he had truely &amp; playnly
reueled and confessed all thinges that were of hym required, that he
should haue lycēce to speake to ye kyng which (whether it were to sue for
perdon and grace, or whether he beynge brought to his presence would
haue sticked hym with a dagger as men then iudged) he sore desyred
and requyred. But when he had confessed the whole facte and conspiracye
vpon Allsoulen daie withoute arreignemente or iudgemente he
was at Salsburye in the open merker place on a newe skaffolde behedded
and put to deathe. This deathe (as a reward) the duke of Buckyngham
receaued at the handes of kyng Richard, whome he before in hys
affaires, purposes and entreprises had holdē susteyned and set forward
aboue all Godes forbode.
               By thys all men maye easelye perceaue that he not onley loseth
bothe his laboure, traueyle and industire, an ferther steynethe and

spotteth his ligne with a perpetuall ignomony and reproche, whiche
in euyll and mishiefe assisteth and aydeth an euyll disposed person, considerynge
for the moost parte that he for his frendely fauoure shoulde
receaue some greate displeasure or infortunate chaunce. Beside that
God of his iustice in conclusion appoyneteth to hym a condigne peyne
and affliccion for his merites and desertes. While these thynges were
thus hādeled and ordred in Englande, Henry Earle of Richemond prepared
and armye of fyue thousande manly Brytons, and fortie well
furnyshed shippes. When all thinges were prepared in aredynes and
the daye of departynge and settynge forwarde was appoynted, whiche
was the .xii. daye of the moneth of October, in the yere of the incarnacion
of oure redemer .M.CCCC.xlviii. and in the seconde yere
of kynge Richardes reigne, the whole armye wente on shipboorde and
halsed vp their sailes, and with a prosperous wynde tooke the see: but
towarde nyghte the wynde chaunged and the wether tourned, and so
houge and terrible a tempeste sodaynely roase, that with the verie power
and strengthe of the storme, the shippes were disparcled, seuered
and seperate a sondre: some by force were dryuen into Normandye,
some were compelled to retourne agayne into Britayne. The shippe
wherein the Earle of Rychemonde was, associate onely with one other
barcke was all nyghte tossed and turmoyled. In the mornynge after
when the rage of the furious tempeste was assuaged, and the Ire of the
blusterynge wynde was some deale appeased, aboute the houre of none
thesame daye, the Earle approched to the southe parte of the realme
of Englande euen at the mouthe of the hauen of pole in the countie of
dorcet, where he mighte playnely perceaue all these bankes and shores
garnisshed and furnyshed with men of warre and souldioners appoynted
and deputed there to defende his arryuall and landynge as before
is mencioned. Wherefore he gaue streyghte charge and sore
commaundemente, that no person shoulde once presume to take lande
and goo too the shore, vntill suche tyme as the whole nauye were assembled
and congregate. And while he exspected and lyngered tariyenge
for that purpose, he sente oute a shippe bote towarde the lande
side to knowe, whyther they whiche stoode there in suche a nombre and
so well furnysshed in apparell defensyue were hys capitall foes and
ennemyes or elles his frendes fautoures and comforters. They that
were sente in exploracion and message were instantely desyred of the
men of warre kepynge these coast (whiche thereof were before instructed
and admonished) to dissende and take lande, affirmynge that they were
appoyncted by the duke of Buckyngham there to awayte and tarie for
the arryuall and landyng of the erle of Rychemond, and to conduicte sauely
to the campe where the duke not ferre of laye encāped with a populous
armye and an host of great strength and vigor, to thentent that the
duke and the erle ioynynge in puyssaunces and forces together, mighte
prosecute and chace kyng Richard beyng destitute of men, and in maner

desperate and fugityue, and so by that meanes and their awne laboures
and industrie to obteine the ende of their entreprise whiche they had before
begonne.
               The erle of Richemonde suspectynge their flatterynge requeste to be
but a fraude (as yt was in dede) after that he perceaued none of his
shippes to apere in sight, he we

hauynge a prosperous and strenable wynde and a freshe gale sente
euen by God to delyuer hym from that perell and ieopardie, arryued
safe and in securitie in the duchy of Normandye, where he to re
                     •
                  teshe
and solace his souldyours and people, tooke his recreacion by the space
of .iii. dayes, and clerely determyned with parte of his companye to
passe all by lande agayne into Britayne. And in the meane ceason he
sent oratoures to the frenche kynge called Charles the .viii. whiche newely
succeded his father kynge Lewes the .xi. not longe before departed
to God, requirynge hym of a safe conduicte and licence to passe
throughe his countrey of Normandye into Brytayne. The younge
kynge hauynge compassion of the misfortune and vnfortunate chaunce
of the earle of Richemonde, not onely gently graunted and assigned to
hym a pasporte, but also liberally disbursed and departed to hym a conuehtente
some of money for his conduicte and expenses necessary in hys
longe iourney and passage. But the erle trustynge on the Frenche kynges
humanitee auentured to send his shippes home into Britayne, and
to set forwarde hym selfe by lande on his iourney makynge no greate
hast till his messengers were retourned, whiche beynge with the benefite
so comforted, and with hope of prosperous successe so encouraged, mershed
towarde Britayne with al diligent celerite entendyng there to consulte
farther with his louers and frēdes of his affaires and entreprises.
When he was retorned agayn into Britayne he was certified by credible
informaciō that the duke of Buckyngham had lost his hed and that
the Marques dorcet and a great nombre of noble men of England had
a lytle before enquyred and searched for him there, &amp; were nowe retourned
to Uānes. When he had heard these newes thus reported, he first sorowed,
&amp; dolorously lamented the first attempte and settyng forward of
his frendes, and in especiall of the nobilyte not to haue more fortunatly
succeded. Secondarely, he reioysed on theother parte that God had sent
hym so many valiaunte and prudent captaines to be his compaignions
in his mertiall entreprises, trustynge surely and nothinge doubtynge in
his awne opinion, but that all his busynes shoulde be wisely compassed
and brought to a good cōclusion. Wherfore he determinyng with al diligēce
to accelerate &amp; set forward his newe begonne busynes departed to
Renes &amp; sent certayne of his preuie seruitours to conducte and bryng ye
Marques and then other noble men to his presence. When they knewe
that he was sauely retorned into Britayne, lord howe they reioysed and
applauded, for before that tyme they myssed hym and knewe not in
what parte of the worlde to make inuestigacion or searche for hym.

For thei doubted and no lesse feared least he had taken land in Englād,
and fallen in the handes of kynge Richarde, in whose person they knewe
well was neither mercy nor compassion. Wherefore in all spedy maner
they galloped toward him, and him reuerentely saluted, which metynge
after great ioye and solace and no smal thankes and gratificacions geuen
and rendred on bothe partes, they consulted and aduisedely debated
and commoned of their great busines and weightie entreprise, in the
whiche ceason the solempne feaste of the natiuite of oute sauiour Christ
happened, on whiche daie al thenglishe lordes went with great solempnyte
to the chiefe churche of the citee, and there eache gaue faythe and
promyse to other. The erle hym selfe fyrste tooke a corporall othe, and
on his honoure promysynge that incontynente after he should be possessed
of the crowne and dignytie of the realme iof Englande, he woulde
be conioyned in matrymonye with the ladye Elizabeth daughter to
kynge Edwarde the fourthe. Then all the companye sware to hym
fealtie, and did to hym homage as though he had bene that tyme the
crowned kynge and anoynted prynce, promisynge faythefully and fermely
assurynge that they woulde not onely lese their wordely substaunce,
but also be priuated of their lyues and worldely felicitee, rather
then to suffre kynge Rycharde that tyraunt lenger to rule and reigne
ouer theim. Whiche solempne othes made and taken, the Earle of
Rychemonde declared and communicated all these doynges to Fraunces
duke of Britayne, desirynge and mooste hartely requyrynge hym to
ayde hym with a greater armye to conduicte hym into his countreye,
whiche so sore longed and loked for his retourne, and to the whiche he
was by the more parte of the nobilite and comminaltie called and desyced
whiche (with goddes ayde and the dukes comforte) he doubted not
in shorte tyme to obteyne, requirynge hym farther to prest to hym a conueniente
some of money, affirmynge that all such somes of money which
he had receaued of hys especiall frendes, were spente and exhausted in
the preparacion of the laste iourney made towarde Englande, whyche
somes of money after his entreprise once acheued, he in the woorde of a
prynce faythefully promysed to repaye and restore agayne. The
duke promysed hym ayde and helpe, vpon confidence whereof the rigged
his shippes, and set foorth his nauy well decked with ordynaunce, and
warlykely furnyshed with al thinges necessary, to thentente to saile forwarde
shortely, and to se no conuenient tyme slackely ouerpassed nor be
pretermitted.
               In the meane ceason, kynge Richarde apprehended in dyuerse partes
of the realme certeyne gentylmen of the earle of Rychemondes faccion
and confederacion, whiche either entended to saile into Britayne
towarde hym, or els at his landynge to assiste and ayde hym. Emongeste
whome, sir George Browne, sit Roger Clyfforde and .iiii. other
were put to execucion at London, and sir Thomas Sentliger whiche
had maried the duches of Exceter the kyngs awne suster, and Thomas

Rame and diuerse other were executed at exceter. Beside these persones,
diuerse of his houshold seruauntes whome either he suspected or doubted,
were by great crueltie put to shamefull death. After this he called a
parliamente in the whiche he attaynted the erle of Richemond &amp; al other
persones whiche were fled out of the realme for feare or any other cause,
as enemies to hym and to their naturall countrey, and all their landes,
goodes and possessions were con
                     •
                  iscate and seased to ye kynges vse. And
yet not contente with this praye whiche no doubte was of no small valour
and moment, he laied on the peoples neckes a greate taxe and tallage,
and surely necessite to that acte in manet him compelled. For what
with purgyng and declaryng his innocencie concernyng the murther of
his nephewes towarde the world, and what with coste to obtayne y• loue
and fauoure of the comminaltie (whiche outwardely glosed and openly
dissimuled with him) he gaue prodigally so many and so great rewardes
that nowe bothe he lacked and skace wist honestely howe to borowe. In
this troubleous ceason, nothinge was more merueled at then that the
lord Stanley had not bene taken and reputed as an enemy to the king,
considerynge the workynge of the ladye Margarete his wife mother to
the earle of Richemonde, but forasmuche as the entreprise of a woman
was of hym reputed of no regarde or estimacion, and that the lord Thomas
her husbande had purged hym selfe sufficientely to be innocente of
all doynges and attemptes by her perpetrated and committed, yt was
geuen him in charge to kepe her in some lecrete place at home, withoute
hauynge enie seruaunte or companye, so that from thence foorthe she
shoulde neuer sende letter nor messenger to her sonne nor nay of his
frendes or confederates, by the whyche the kynge myghte be molested
or troubled, or any hurte or preiudice mighte be attempted againste his
realme and comminaltie. Whiche commaundemente was a while put in
execucion and accomplished accordynge to his dreadfull commaundemente.
Yet the wilde worme of vengaunce wauerynge in his hed coulde
not be contented with the deathe of diuerse gentlemen suspected of treason,
but also he muste extende his bloudy furye agaynste a poore gentleman
called Collyngborne for makynge a small ryme of thre of his vnfortunate
councelers, which were the lord louell, sir Richarde Radelyffe
his myscheuous mynion, and sir Wylliam Catesbey his secrete seducer,
whiche metre was.

cognisaunce, but because the fyrste lyne ended in dogge, then metrician
coulde not obseruynge the regimentes of metre ende the seconde
verse in Bore, but called the bore an hogge. This poeticall schoolemayster
corrector of breues and longes, caused Collyngborne to be
abbreuiate shorter by the hed, and too bee deuyded into foure quarters.

apperteignyng to the toune of Berwike according to the true meanyng
of the league.
               
                  
                   Item it is agreed and apoynted that no person of England or Scotland
shal duryng thesaid truce, build, eare or sowe any landes or groūd
beynge within the boundes of the batable ground, but no suffre thesame
to continewe in the same condicion that it nowe remayneth.
               When this league and amitie was thus concluded, finished and sealed
with all dewe circumstaunces thereunto requyred. Although kynge
Richard iudged and demed hym selfe somewhat the more stronger and
quyeter by force of this newe amitie and concluded confederacie, yet to
augemnte more the familiarite begonne betwene the kynge of Scottes
and hym, and to haue a double strynge for his bowe, he entreated a new
aliaunce and mariage to be concluded betwene the prince of Rothsaye
eldeste sonne to the kyng of Scottes, and lady Anne de la poole daughter
to Ihon duke of Suffolke and lady Anne suster to kyng Richarde,
whiche suster he so muche fauoured that he studyenge all the weies by
the whiche he might auaunce her offprynge and lignage, did not onely
procure and seke meanes howe to make her daughter a pryncesse, and
consequentely a Quene, but also after the deathe of his sonne, he proclaymed
Ihon erle of Lyncolne his nephew and her sonne, heyre apparaunt
to ye crowne of England, dishenetityng kynge Edwardes daughters,
whose brethren before you haue heard he shamefully killed &amp; murthered.
               The kynge of Scottes hauynge nede of Frendes, but not so muche
nede as kynge Richard whiche was of necessite compelled to seke aiders
and to entreteyne fautours, the one for fauourynge of flatterers and
base borne persones, and theother not onely for tyrannye and vnnaturall
homicide, but also for the vsurpacion of the crowne beynge of all
the realme detested and disdayned, gladly accepted and ioyousely concented
to kynge Richardes deuyce and coniuncion of amitie, perfightely
remembrynge that emongest all bondes and obligacions of loue and
amitie, that there is neither a surer nor a more perfighter locke, then the
knote of coniuncion in the sacramente of Matrimonye, whiche was in
the very begynnynge of the firste age of man, ordeyned and instituted
in the holy place of paradise terrestiall by God hym selfe: by reason
whereof, the propagacion and succession of the humane nature, stablished
vpon the sure seate of lawfull matrimony betwene prynces, maye
norishe peace concorde and vnite, aswage and breake the furyous rage
of truculente Mars and terrible battayle, and encreace loue, fauoure
and familiarite. Wherfore thesayde prynces sente their ambassadours
and councelours agayne to the toune of Nottyngham, where thesayde
mariage was by writinges and instrumentes couenaūted, cōdiscended
and agreed, and affiances made and taken by procters and deputies
on bothe par
                     •
                  es, and she ymediately called pryncesse of Rothsay, whiche
name she shortely loste by the shorte life of kynge Richarde her louyng
vncle. Here maye well be noted the vnnaturall loue and disordered
affeccion whiche this kynde kynseman shewed to his blood: For he

not remembryng the tyranny that he had executed against his brothers
sonnes, the wrong and manifest iniury that he had done to his brothers
daughters, bothe in takynge from theim their dignyte, possessions
and lyuynge, thoughte yt shoulde redounde greately to his honoure
and fame, yf he promoted his susters chylde (to whome he was nothynge
bounde in conscience to make restitucion) to the dignyte of a
Quene, rather then to preferre his brothers daughter whome he had
vntruely and by force dishenerited, and of all their righte depryued, to
the mariage of a meane esquyer: suche was his fraternall kyndenes
towarde his brother, and suche was his large conscience towardes his
brothers children.
               After this league and mariage thus concluded and agreed, the kyng
of Scottes disdeignynge that the stronge castell of Dumbarre should
remayne in thenglish mennes handes and possession, wrote a gentle letter
to kyng Richard, delcaryng to hym that where in the league concluded
betwene theim, yt was agreed and appoyncted that he should within .xl.
dayes nexte ensuynge, expresse and declare his opynion and meanynge
concernynge the castell of Dumbarre, whether the sayde castell
shoulde be occupyed and stande still in the handes of thenglishemen
durynge the whole tyme of the truce, or elles for the terme of sixe monethes
onely. He nowe certefyed kynge Rycharde by his letters, that
he was contente that he and his shoulde enioye the possessyon of thesayde
castell quyetely and peaceably durynge thesayde truce and amitie.
Neuerthelesse he requyred hym for the loue and familiarite that
nowe bothe by treatie and alyaunce was spronge and knyt betwene
theim, that he woulde redelyuer thesayde castell into his handes, whiche
was vntruely possessed of thenglishe nacion by delyuerye of rebelles
and treytours, contrarie to all righte, equitie, and conscience. Kynge Richarde
dalyed with pleasaunte letters and fayre woordes, and so foded
foorth the kynge of Scottes, that he neuer had Dumbarre delyuered
while kynge Richarde lyued, after whose deathe, whether yt were
by treason or by apoyntemente, the castell was rendred to the kynge of
Scottes to his greate contentacion and reioysyng. Albeit this league &amp;
amitie thus couenaunted and concluded, it mighte manifestely seme to
all persons, that all coniuracions and confederacies agaynst kynge Richard
were extinct and put scylence, and in especial considerynge that ye
duke of Buckyngham and his alyes were made oute of his waye, some
by death, and some by banyshment and exilynge into farre countreies &amp;
regions. Yet kyng Richard more doubtyng then trustyng to his awne
people and frendes was contynually vexed, tossed and vnquyeted with
feare of the retourne of the erle of Richemond and his complices &amp; fauroures,
which dailye dread and hourely agony, caused him to lyue in dolefull
misery, euer vnquiet, &amp; in maner incontinual calamitie. Wherfore
he entendynge to be releued and to haue all his dolorous imaginacion
alleuyated, determyned clerely to extirpate and plucke al the mater and

grounde of his feare and doubtes. Wherefore after longe and deliberate
consu
                     •
                  tacion had, nothinge was for his purpose and entente
thought either more necessary or expedient then once agayne with price,
praier and rewardes, to attempt ye duke of Britaine in whose territorie y•
erle of Richemond then abode, to deliuer thesaide erle into his hādes, by
whiche onely meanes he shoulde be discharged of all feare of perel, and
brought ot rest and quietnes bothe of body &amp; mynd. Wherfore incontynent
he sent certeine ambassadoures to y• duke of Britayne, which tooke
vpon theim (beside the great and ample rewardes ye they brought with
theim into Britayne) that kyng Richard should yerely paie &amp; aunswer
the duke of al the reuenues, rentes and profites, of the seignories, lādes
&amp; possessions aswell belonging &amp; apperteigning to the erle of Richmōd,
as to any other noble or gentleman whiche then were in the erles company,
yf he after that tyme would kepe theim in continuall pryson and
restreine theim from libertie.
               The Oratoures furnished with these and other instruccions, arriued
in Britayne and came to the dukes house, where with hym they coulde
haue no maner of communicacion concernynge their weightie affaires,
by reason that he beyng fatigate and weakened by a longe and daily infirmitie,
beganne a lytle to waxe ydle and weake in his wyt and remembraunce.
For which cause Peter Landoyse his chiefe treasouter, a man
bothe or pregnaunt wit and great authorite, ruled and adiuged al thinges
at his p
                     •
                  easure and commaundemēt, for the which cause (as men set
into high authorite be not best beloued) he excited and prouoked against
him the malice and euell will of ye nobilite of Britayne, which afterward
for diuerse great offences by him durynge his authorite perpetrate and
committed, by their meanes was brought to death and cōfusion. Thenglishe
ambassadoures moued their message and request to Peter Landoyse,
and to hym declared their masters commaundemente, instantely
requiringe, and humbly disirynge him (in whose powre it laie to do all
thing in Britayne) that he woulde fren
                     •
                  ely assent to the request of kyng
Richard offering to him the same rewardes and landes, that thei should
haue offered to the duke.
               This Peter whiche was no lesse disdeyned then hated almost of all
the people of Britayne▪ thoughte that yf he dyd assent and satisfie kyng
Richardes petycion and desyre, he shoulde be of powre and habilite sufficiente
to withstande and re
                     •
                  ell the malicious attemptes and disdeynfull
inuencions of his enuious aduersaries. Wherefore he feithefully
promysed to accomplishe kyng Richardes request and desyre, so that he
kepte promise with him, that he might be hable to withstande y• cancard
m
                     •
                  lice of his secrete enemies. This acte that he promised to do, was not
for nay grudge or malice that he bate to the earle of Richemonde▪ for as
you haue heard before, he delyuered him from perell of deathe at saynct
Malos when he was in great doubte of life and ieopardie but as cause
riseth we euer offende, and that cursed, hungre of golde and execrable

thirst of lucre, and inward feare of losse of aucthorite, driueth the blynde
myndes of couetous men and ambicious persones to euilles and misch
                     ••
                  es
innumerable, not remembryng losse of name, obloquy of the people,
nor in conclusion the punyshement of God for their merites and desertes.
But fortune was so fauourable to the publicke wealth of the realme
of Englande that this deadly and dolorous compact tooke none
effect or place. For while postes ranne, and letters were sent to and frotor
ye finisshyng of this great entreprise betwene kyng Richard &amp; Peter
Landoyse, Ihon Morton bishop of Ely soiornynge then in Flaunders,
was of al this craftie cōueighaunce certified by his secret &amp; sure frēdes:
wherfore he sent Christopher Urswike (whiche at that verie ceason was
come out of Britayne into Flaunders) to declare to the erle of Richmōd
howe al the deceipte &amp; craftie working was conueighed and compassed,
geuyng him in charge to councell and aduise ye erle in al hast possible wt
al his cōpany to retire out of Britayne into Fraūce. When these newes
were brought to the erle he then kept house in Uannes, and incontinent
dispatched agayne Christopher Urswike to Charles the French kynge,
requyring him that he and his might sauely passe into Fraunce, whiche
desyre, impetrated and obteyned, the messenger shortely returned to
his lorde and prince. The erle well perceauynge that it was expediente
and necessarie with al spede and diligence, to loke to this weightie mattre,
callynge verie fewe to councell, he made exploracion and searche of
all secret and by weyes, and sent before all his noble men, as though for
a certayne familiaritee and kyndenes they should visite and comforte ye
duke▪ which then for recreacion and chaunge of ayre, laie on the borders
and confynes of Fraunce. And secretely he gaue charge to the Earle of
pembrooke which was the leader and conducter of his compaigny, that
when they approched the marches and lymites of Britayne, they should
dyuerte and take the next weye into Fraunce. The noble men somewhat
suspicious of thinges newely imagened, without any tariyng or by the
iorney ga
                     •
                  ynge, scouryng the weies as fast as there horse would ronne,
or as they conuenientely might beare &amp; susteyne, came oute of the duchy
of Britayne into y• duchy of Angeou in the dominion of Fraunce, where
they exspected the earles commynge, which .ii. daies after departed
oute of Uannes onely accompaignied with .v. seruytoures, as though
he had gone secretely to visite a familier frende of his in a small village
adioynynge. No man suspected that he woulde departe, considerynge
that a greate multitude of Englishemen were lefte and contynued in
the citee, but after that he had passed directly fyue myles forward, he sodaynly
turned into a solitarye wood nexte adioynynge, where clothinge
hym selfe in the symple cote of his poore seruaunte, made and apoynted
his saide mynister leader and Master of his small compaignye, and he
as an humble page dyligently folowed and serued his countrefeate gouernoure,
neuer restynge nor theim selues refreshynge excepte the baytyng
of their horses till thei by wayes vnknowen nowe this waie, nowe

turnynge that waye, came to their company abidyng theim in angiers.
               The fourthe daye after the earle of Richemonde was thus departed,
that craftie marchaunte Peter landoyse, trustynge still after his praye
promised by kyng Richard, was ready to set forwarde his crew of souldyours,
whiche he preuely had consigned with certayne trustye capiteynes
for that onely purpose appoynted and elected, to performe &amp; acheue
his pretensed entreprise, dissymulynge and feignynge theim to be conducted
and hyred by hym to serue the Earle of Richemond, and hym to
conduyte in his retourne towarde his natiue countrey, meanynge none
other thynge but to apprehende hym and theother noble men in his retynue,
whiche no suche fraude suspectynge, nor yet any treason ymagenynge,
vnware and vnprouided and destitute of all ayde, and theim to
cast and detrude sodaynly into continual captiuite and bondage▪ to thē
                  tente
that by this facinorous and naughtie acte, he mighte satisfie the
charitable request and louynge desyre of good kynge Richard, more for
his awne profite then kyng Richards gayne. But when this crafty dissymuler
Peter Landoyse, whiche was no Wylyer then an olde Foxe,
perceaued that the earle was departed (thynkynge that to be trewe that
he ymagened) lorde howe currioures rane into euery coaste, howe lighte
horsemen galloped to euery streyt to folowe and deteyne hym, yf by any
possibilite he coulde be subsecuted and ouertaken, and hym to incarcerate
and brynge captyue into the citee of Uannes. The horsemen made
suche diligence, and with such celerite set forward their iorney, that nothing
was more likely them thei to haue obteined, ye &amp; seazed their praie.
For the erle of Richmond was not entred into y• realme of Fraunce scace
one hour, but y• folowers came to the lymites and confines of Britayne,
and durst auenture no farther but veinely without their desyre sorofully
re
                     •
                  ourned. At whiche season were left at Uannes aboute the nombre
of .iii. Englishemen, which not beynge called to councell and vnware of
this entreprice, but knowynge of the erles sodeyne departure were so incontinently
astouned, that in maner thei were al in dispayre both of him
and their awne securite and sauegarde. But fortune tourned her saile, &amp;
otherwyse yt happened then there feare theim encombred. For the duke
of Britayne nowe beyng somewh
                     •
                  t recouered, was sore displeased, and
nothinge contented that the erle o
                     •
                   Richmonde was in his dominion so
vncurteously tracted and entreated, that he should be by fraud and vntruthe
compelled to leaue and flye oute of his duchye and countrey contrary
to his honoure. Wherfore he tooke greate displeasure with Peter
Landoyse his treasourer, to whom (although he knewe not &amp; was ygnoraunte
that all the drifte was dryuen and deuysed by hym) he laied the
faut and imputed the cryme. Wherfore he sent for Edward Wooduile,
and Edward pownynges valiaunte esquyers of England, and delyuered
vnto theim monye sufficiente for their conduyte, wyllynge theim to
conuey the rest of thenglishmen beynge in Brytayne, to the earle of Richemondes
presence. When the Earle was thus furnyshed &amp; apoynted

with his trusty company, and was escaped all y• daūgerous labirinthes
and snares 
                     〈◊〉
                   were set for him, no meruel though he were io
                     •
                  unde and
glad of ye prosperous successe that happened in his affaires. Wherefore,
lest he should seme to be blotted with the note of ingratitude, he sent dyuerse
of his gentlemē to the duke of Britaine, the which should publishe
&amp; declare to hym on the behalfe of the erle, that he and his, were onely by
his benefite and fauoure conserued and delyuered from the imminente
daunger y• they were like to be trapped in. Wherfore at that time he rendred

but in tyme to come liberally to recōpence him with actes &amp; dedes.
               After this, the erle tooke his iourney to Charles y• French kyng, lyeng
then at Langes vpō the riuer of leyre, to whome after great thankes geuen
for manifolde gratuytes by him to the erle shewed, he disclosed and
manifested y• cause &amp; occasiō of his accesse &amp; repaire to his person. After
that he requyred of hym helpe▪ and succour, to thentente that by his immortall
benefite to him at that tyme shewed, he might sauely retourne to

the tyranny of kyng Richard. Kyng Charles promysed him aide
and comfort, and bad him be of good courage and make good chere, for
he assured him that he would gladly shewe to him his beneuolent mynd
and bountefull liberalite. Which kyng from thence remoued to Moūtargis,

the erle of Richmond folowed, entending there to solicite his mattre to y•

and not to be regarded in comparison of that mischeuous ymaginacion
whiche he nowe newely beganne and attempted. There came into hys
vngracious mynde a thinge not onely detestable to be spoken of in the
remembraunce of man, but muche more cruell and abhominable to be
put in execucion. For when he reuolued in his wauerynge mynde howe
greate a founteyne of mischiefe towarde hym shoulde sprynge, yf the

erle of Richmond shoulde be auaunced to the mariage of his nece, which
thinge he hearde saye by the rumour of the people that no small nombre
of wise and wittye personages entreprised to compasse &amp; brynge to conclusion.
He clerely determined to reconcile to his fauoure his brothers
wife quene Elizabeth either by faire woordes or liberall promises, firmely
beleuynge her fauoure once obteined that she woulde not sticke to
commite and louyngly credite to him the rule and gouernaunce both of
her and her daughters, and so by that meanes the erle of Richemonde of
the affinite of his nece shoulde be vtterly defrauded and beguyled. And
yf no ingenyous remedye coulde be otherwise inuented to saue the innumerable
mischiefes whiche were euen at hand and like to falle, yf yt
shoulde happen quene Anne his wife to departe oute of this presente
worlde, then he him selfe woulde rather take to wife his cousyn and nece
the lady Elizabeth, then for lack of that affinite the whole realme should
runne to ruyne, as who said, that yf he once fell from his estate and dignite,
the ruyne of the realme must nedes shortely ensue &amp; folowe. Wherfore
he sent to the quene beynge in sanctuarie diuerse and often messengers,
whiche first shoulde excuse and purge him of all thinges before againste
her attempted or procured, and after shoulde so largely promes
promocions innumerable and benefites, not onely to her but also to her
sonne lord Thomas Marques Dorcett, that they should brynge her yf
yt were possible into some wanhope, or as men saie into a fooles paradise.
The messengers beynge men bothe of wit and grauitie so persuaded
the quene with great &amp; pregnaunte reasons, then with fayre &amp; large
promises, that she began somewhat to relent &amp; to geue to theim no deffe
eare, in somuche that she faithfully promised to submyt &amp; yelde her selfe
fully and frankely to the kynges will and pleasure. And so she putting
in obliuion the murther of her innocente children, the infamy and dishonoure
spoken by the kynge her husbande, the lyuynge in auoutrie leyed
to her charge, the bastardyng of her daughters, forgettyng also y• feithfull
promes &amp; open othe made to the countesse of Richmon
                     •
                   mother to y•
erle Henry, blynded by auaricious affeccion and seduced by flatterynge
wordes, first deliuered into kyng Richards hādes her .v. daughters, as
Lambes once agayn committed to the custody of the rauenous wolfe.
After she sente letters to the Marques her sonne beynge then at Parys
with the earle of Richmonde, willynge him in any wise to leaue the earle
and without delaie to repaire into Englande, where, for hym were prouided
greate honoures and honorable promocions, asserteignynge hym
ferther, that all offences on bothe parties were forgotten and forgeuen,
and bothe he and she highely incorporate in the kynges hearte. Surely
the inconstancie of this woman were muche to be merueled a
                     •
                  , yf
all women had bene founde constante, but let men speake, yet wemen of
the verie bonde of nature will folowe their awne kynde. After that
kynge Rycharde had thus with glorious promyses and flatterynge
woordes pleased and appeased the mutable mynde of quene Elyzabeth

which knewe nothing lesse then that he moost entended, he caused al his
brothers daughters to be conueighed into his paleys with solempne receauyng,
as though with his newe familier and louyng entreteinement
they shoulde forget, and in their myndes obliterate the olde committed
iniurie and late perpetrate tyrannye. Nowe nothinge was contrariant
and obstacle to his pernicious purpose, but that his mancion was not
voide of his wife, whiche thynge he in anywise adiuged necessary to be
done. But there was one thyng that so muche feared and dragged hym
from commyttynge this abhominable murther, because as you haue
hearde before he beganne to countrefaycte the ymage of a good and wel
disposed person, and therfore he was afeard leaste y• sodeine and immature
death of his wife once openly knowen, he should lese the good and
credible opinion whiche the people had of him, without deserte conceaued
and reported. But in conclusion, euyll councell preuailed in a witt
lately mynded to mischiefe, and tourned from all goodnes. So that his
vngracious desyre ouercame his honest feare. And first to entre into the
gates of his ymagened entreprise, he absteyned bothe from the bed and
companye of his wife. After, he compleyned to dyuerse noble men of the
realme, of the infortunate sterilite and barennes of his wife, because she
brought foorth non fruyte and generacion of her bodye. And in especiall
he accompted to Thomas Rotheram archebishop of Yorke (whome lately
he had delyuered oute of warde and captiuite) these impedymentes
of is quene and dyuerse other, thinkyng that he woulde enucleate and
open to her all these thinges, trustynge the sequele herof to take his effecte,
that she herynge this grudge of her husband, and takyng therfore
an inwarde thought, woulde not longe lyue in this worlde. Of this the
bishoppe gathered (whiche well knewe the complexion and vsage of the
kyng) that the quenes dayes were short, and that he declared to certeine
of his secrete frendes. After this he procured a common rumour (but he
woulde not haue the author knowen) to be published and spred abroade
emonge the common people that the quene was ded, to thentent that she
takyng some cōceipte of this straung fame, should fall into some sodayne
sicknes or greuous maladye, &amp; to proue 
                     〈◊〉

                  e, whyther y• people would impute
her death to the thought or sicknes, or therof would laie y• blame to
him. Whē y• quene heard tell that so horrible a rumour of her death was
sprong emongest the comminaltie, she sore suspected and iuged ye world
to be almost at an ende with her, and in that sorofull agony, she with lamentable
countenaunce and soroful chere, repaired to the presence of the
kyng her husband, demaundynge of hym, what yt should meane that he
had iuged her worthy to dye. The kyng aunswered her with fare woordes,
and with dissimulynge blandimentes and flatteryng lesynges comforted
her, biddynge her to be of good comforte, for to his knowlege she
shoulde haue none other cause. But howsoeuer y• it fortuned, either by
inward thought and pensyuenes of hearte, or by intoxicacion of poyson

(which is affirmed to be moost lik
                     •
                  ly) within a few daies after, the quene
departed oute of this transitorie lyfe, and was with dewe solemp
                     •
                  ite buried
in the churche of s
                     •
                  int Peter at Westminster. This is thesame Anne
one of the daughters of y• erle of Warwyk, which as you haue heard
before at the request of lewes y• French kyng, was maried to prince Edward
sonne to kyng Henry the vi.
               The kyng thus (accordyng to his long desire) losed oute of the bōdes
of matrimony, beganne to cast a foolyshe phantasie to Lady Elizabeth
his nece, making much suite to haue her ioyned with him in lawfull matrimony:
But because all men, and the mayden her selfe moost of al, detested
and abhorred this vnlawfull and in maner vnnaturall copulacion,
he determined to prolonge and deferre the matter till he were in
a more quietnes. For all that verie reason he was oppressed with great,
weightie and vrgent causes and busynesses on euery side, considerynge
that dailye parte of the nobilite sailed into Fraunce to the erle of Richmond:
Other preuely fauoured &amp; aided certeine of the coniuracion, so
&amp;of his shorte ende, fewe or none were in doubte. And ye common people
for the moost part were brought to such desperaciō, y• many of theim had
rather be reputed &amp; taken of him in ye nōbre of his enemies, then to abide
the chaunce and hazard to haue their goodes taken as a spoile of victorie
by his enemies. Emongest the noble men whome he moost mystrusted,
these were the principall, Thomas lorde Stanley, Sir William
Stanley his brother, Eylbert Talbot and .vi. hundred other, of whose
purposes although kyng Richard were ignoraunt, yet he gaue neyther
confidence nor credence to any one of theim, and least of all to the Lorde
Stanley, because he was ioyned in matrimony with the lady Margarete
mother to the erle of Richmond as afterward apparauntly ye maie
perceaue. For when thesayde lorde Stanley woulde haue departed into
his countrey to visite his familie, and to recreate and refreshe his spirites
(as he openly sayde) but the truth was to thentent to be in a persight
readines to receaue the erle of Richmōd at his first arriual in Englād:
the kyng in no wise woulde suffre hym to departe before that he had left
as an hostage in the courte George Stanley lorde straung his first begotten
sonne and heire. While kynge Richard was thus troubled and
vexed with ymaginacions of the tumulteous time that was lyke to come:
Lo

                  , euen sodeinly he herde newes that fyer was sprong oute of
the smoke and the warre, recently begonne, and that the castell of hammes
was deliuered into the handes of the earle of Rychmonde by the
meanes of the earle of Oxenforde and that not only he but also Iames
Blount capiteine of the castel, were fled into Fraunce to aide the Earle
Henry. Wherfore he thynkynge yt great pollicie to withstand the fyrst
brunt sent the moost part of the garrison of Caleis, to recouer again by
force the castell of Hammes. They whiche were in the castell perceauing
their aduersaries to approche, prepared municions and engins for their
defence, and sente also to the Earle of Richemonde, to aduertise hym of

syde entred into the castell. The souldioures within greately animated
and muche comforted by this newe succour and aide, greued thenemies
by shortyng frō y• walles more then they were accustomed to do.
And they of the Castell vexed their enemies on the foreparte: the Earle
of Oxenforde no lesse molested and vnquiet

                  d theim on theother parte,
whiche was the occasion that kyng Richardes men offred of their awne
mere mocion licence to all beynge within the castell to departe in sauetie
with bagge and baggage nothinge excepted: whiche condicion the earle
of Oxenforde commynge only for that purpose to delyuer his louynge

                  ell and daunger▪ &amp; chiefely of all, his olde hostesse
Iane Blount wife to Iames Blount the capteine, would in no wise repudiate
or refuse. And so leauynge the Castell bare and vngarnysshed
bothe of vitaile and artillary, came safe to the erle of Richmond soiournyng
in Parys. Duryng this tyme, kynge Richard was credebly informed
of his explorators &amp; espialles y• y• erle of Richmond was wt longe
suyte in the courte of Fraunce sore fatigate &amp; weried, &amp; desyryng greate
a
                     •
                  de, coulde obteine small releue. In so muche y• all thyng went so farre
backward, that suche thinges as were with great diligence and no lesse
deliberation purposed and determined to be set forward, were nowe dasshed
and ouerthrowen to the ground. Kynge Richarde eyther beynge
to light of credence, or seduced and deluded by hys craftie taletellers,
grea
                     •
                  ly reioysed as though he had obteyned the ouerhand of his enemyes
with triumph and victorie, and thought hym selfe neuer so surely
delyuered of all reare and dreadfull ymaginacions, so that he neded
nowe no more once for that cause eyther to wake of breake his golden
slepe. Wherefore he called home againe his shippes of warre whiche he
had apoynted to kepe the narowe sees, &amp; dispatched al such souldioures
as he had deputed to kepe certeine garrisons &amp; to stoppe certeine passages
as you haue heard before. Yet least he might for lacke of prouisyon
be sodeinly trapped he streightly charged and gaue in commaundemēt
to all noble men and in especiall suche as inhabited nere to the see coaste
and on the frontiers of wales, that accordyng to the vsage of the countrey,
thei should kepe diligent watche &amp; stronge warde, to ye entent ye his
aduersaries in no wise should haue any place apte or oportune easely to
t
                     •
                  ke lande withoute defence or rebuttynge back. For the custome of the
countreyes adioynyng nere to y• see is (especially in the tyme or warr) on
euery hill or high place to erect a bekon wt a greate lāterne in the toppe,

which maie be sene and discerned a great space of. And when the noyes
is once bruted that the enemies approche nere y• land, they sodeinly put
fyer in the lanthornes and make showtes &amp; outrages frō toune to toune
and from village to village. Some ronne in post frō place to place admonisshyng
the people to be ready to resist the ieopardy, and defende the
perell. And by this pollecy y• fame is sone blowen to euery citee &amp; toune,
in somuche that aswell the cytezens as the rural people be in short space
assembled and armed to refell and put back the newe arryued enemies.
               Nowe to retourne to our purpose, kynge Richarde thus alleuiate of
his accustoned pensiuenes, beganne to be somewhat more merier &amp; toke
lesse thought and care for outwarde enemies then he was woont to do,
as who saie, that he with polletique prouision shoulde withstand the desteny
whiche hong ouer his hed, and was ordened in briefe tyme sodeinly
to fall. Suche is the force and puissaunce of deuyne iustice▪ that euery
man shal lesse regarde, lesse prouide, lesse be in doubte of al things, when
he is moost nerest punishment, and next to his mischaunce for his offences
and crymes.
               Aboute this ceason, while the erle of Richmonde was desirynge ayde
of the Frenche kynge, certeine noble men were there apointed to rule the
realme of Fraunce durynge the minorite of kyng Charles, which emongest
theim selfes were not of one opinion. Of whiche dissencion, Lewes
duke of Orlyaunce was the chiefe sturrer, which because he had maryed
lady Iohanne suster to the Frenche kynge, tooke vpon him aboue other
the rule and administracion of the whole realme. By reason of whyche
controuersie, no one manne only was suffred to rule al, wherfore the erle
of Rychemond was compelled to make suyte to euery one of the councel
seuerally one after another, requiringe and desirynge theim of aide and

partely despayring in the good successe of the erle of Richmōd &amp; partely

secretly in the night ceason stale oute of Parys, and with all diligent

                     •
                  re promises
beyng persuaded, he retourned againe to his cōpaignions. The earle of

Richmond vnburdened of this misauenture, least by procrastinacion of
daies &amp; prolongyng of time, he might lese y• great oportunitee of things
to him offred and ministred: also least he shoulde ferther wounde or molest
the myndes of his feithfull and assured frendes which daily did aspect
&amp; tarie for his cōmyng, determined no lenger to protract &amp; deferre y•
tune, but with al diligence &amp; scelerite to attempte his begonne entreprice
and so obteinyng of kyng Charles a small crewe of men, and borowyng
certeyn sommes of money of him &amp; of diuerse other his pryuate frendes.
For the whiche he left as debter or more likelyer as a pledge or hostage
lord Thomas Marques Dorsett (whome he halfe mistrusted) and Sir
Ihon Burchier, he departed from y• French courte &amp; came to the citee of
Roan. While he taryed there makyng prouisiō at harflete in the mouth
of the ryuer of Seyne for all thinges necessary for his nauy and nauigacion,
tydynges were brought to hym that kynge Richard beynge wt
                  out
children and now wydower, entended shorte
                     •
                  y to mary with Ladye
Elizabeth his brothers daughter, and to preferre the ladye Cicile her
suster to a man founde in a cloude and of an vnknowen lignage and familie.
He tooke these newes as a matter of no small momente (and so
all thynges considered, yt was of no lesse importaunce then he tooke yt
for. For this thyng only tooke aweie from all his compaignions their
hope and courage that they had to obteine an happie enterprice. And
therfore no maruell though it nypped hym at the verie stomacke when
he thought that by no possibilite he might attayne the mariage of any
of kynge Edwardes daughters, whiche was the strongest foūdacion of
his buyldyng, by reason whereof he iudged that all his frendes in England
woulde abandon and shrynke from hym. Wherefore makynge
not many of his councell, after dyuerse consultacions he determined
not yet to set forwarde, but to tarye and attempte howe to get more ayde,
more frendes and more stronger succoures. And emongest al other,
yt was thought moost expedient to allure by affinite in his ayde as a
compaignion in armes Sir Walter Herbert a man of an aunciente
stocke and greate powre emongest the Welshemen, whyche had wyth
hym a faire Ladye to his suster, of age mature and ripe to be coupled
in matrimonie. And for the acheuynge of this purpose, messengers were
secretely sent to Henry Eearle of Northumbreland (whiche had before
maried another suster of Sir Walter Herbertes) gto thentent that he
shoulde set forward all this deuyce and purpose, but the weies were so
narowly watched and so many spies laide that the messenger proceded
not in his iourney and busynes. But in the meane ceason, ther came to
the Earle a more ioyfuller message from Morgan Kydwelly learned in
the temporall lawe, whiche declared that Ryce ap Thomas, a man of
no lesse valyauntnes then actyuitee, and Ihon Sauage an approued
Capteyne, woulde with all their powre be partakers of his quarell.
               And that Reignolde Breye had collected and gotten together no small
some of money for the payment of the wages to the souldioures and

men of warre: admonisshynge him also to make quicke expedicion and
to take his course directely into Wales. The Earle of Richmonde because
he woulde no lenger lynger and weery hys frendes lyuynge
continually betwene hope and feare, determyned in all conueniente hast
to se
                     •
                  f forwarde, and caried to his shippes armoure, weapons, vitayl
                     •
                  
and all other ordinaunces expedient for warre. And shortely to speake,
all thynges he prepared whiche are wont to be necessary and profitable
to the variable chaunces and incerteine accidentes and ieopardies
or warre, whiche requyreth preparaciō of many instrumētes and thinges
chargeable.
               After that the erle had made his humble peticion and deuoute praier
to allmightie God, besechynge hym not only to sende him moost prosperous
wynde and sure passage in his iourney, but also effecteously desyrynge
his goodnes of aide &amp; comforte in his necessite and victorie &amp; supremitie
ouer his enemies, only accompaignied with .ii. thousand menne
and a small nombre of shippes, weyed vp his ancres and halsed vp his
failes and in the calendes of August he sailed from harflet with so prosperous
a wynde that the .vii. daye after his departure he arryued in
Wales in the euenyng at a porte called Mylford Hauen, and in cōtinēt
tooke land and came to a place called Dalle, where he heard saye that a
certeine company of his aduersaries were leyed in garrison to defende
his arryuall all the last wynter. And the earle at the sonne rysyng remoued
to harfford west, beyng distant from dalle not fully ten myle, where
he was applauded and receaued of the people with greate ioye, and he
arryued there so sodeinly that he was come and entred the toune at thesame
tyme when the cytezens had but knowlege of his commynge.
               Here he heard newes whiche were as vntrue as thei truly were reported
to hym in Normandie, that Rice ap Thomas and Ihon sauage wyth
body and goodes were determined to aide kyng Richard. While he and
his compaignie were somewhat appalled of these newe tydynges, there
came such message from thinhabitauntes of the toune of Pembrooke y•
refresshed and reuyued their frosen heartes and daunted courages. For
Arnold Buttler a valiaunt capitain, which first askynge perdon for his
offences before tyme committed against the erle of Richmond, and that
obteyned, declared to hym that the penbrochians were ready to serue &amp;
geue their attendaunce on their natural and immediate lord Iasper erle
of Penbrooke. The erle of Richmond hauyng his armie thus encreased,
departed from Herforde west to the toune of Cardygan beyng .v. myle
distant from thence. While the souldioures were refresshyng and trimmynge
theim selues in their campe, straunge tydynges spronge emonge
theim wtoute any certeine authour, y• sir Walter Herberd which laie wt
a greate crewe of menne at Carmarden▪ was nowe with a greate armye
ready to approche and hyd theim battaile. With which newes the armie
was sore troubled, and euery man assaied his armure and proued hys
weapon and were prest to defende their enemies. And as they were in

this timerous doubte, certeine horsemen which the erle had sent to make
exploracion and searche, retourned and reported all the countrey to bee
quiete and no let nor impedimente to be laied or cast in their iourney.
               And euen at that same tyme the whole armye was greately recomforted
by reason that the commynge of Rycharde Gryffyth, a man of greate
nobilite, the whiche notwithstandynge that he was conferate wyth Sir
Walter Harbert and Richarde app Thomas, yet at that verie instant
he came to the Earle of Richemund with all his compaignie, whyche
were of no great nomber. After hym, thesame daie came Ihon Morgan
wyth his men. Then the Earle auaunced forwarde in good hast,
makynge no repose or abode in any one place. And to thentent to passe
forwarde with sure and short expedicion, he assauted e
                     •
                  ery place where
his ennemies had set any men of warre, whiche with small force and
lesse difficultie he briefely dyd expugne and vanquishe. And sodeynly
he was by his espialles asserteyned that Sir Walter Harbert and Rice
app Thomas were in harnes before hym ready to encountre wyth hys
atmye and to stoppe their passage. Wherefore lyke a valyaunt capteyn
he firste determyned to sett on theim and eyther to destroye or to take
theim into his fauoure, and after with all his powre and puyssaunce
to geue battaile to his mortall enemye kynge Richarde. But to thentent
his frendes shoulde knowe wyth what dexterite his attempted entreprice
proceded forwarde, he sente of his moost secrete and feithfull
seruauntes with letters and instruccions to the ladye Margarete hys
mother, to the Lorde Stanley and his brother, to Talbote and to other
his trustie frendes, declarynge to theim, that he succoured and holpen
with the ayde and releue of his frendes entended to passe ouer y• ryuer
of Seuerne at Shrewsburie, and so to passe directely to the citee of
London, requirynge theim as his especiall truste and confidence was
perplanted in the hope of their fidelite, that they woulde occurre &amp; mete
hym by the waye with all diligent preparacion to thentent that he &amp; thei
at tyme propice and place conuenient might communicate together the
profundyte and depnes of all his dubious and weightie busynes. Whē
the messengers were disparcled with these commaundementes &amp; admonicions,
he marched forward toward Shrewsbury, and in his passynge
there met &amp; saluted him Rice ap Thomas with a goodly bād of Welshmen,
whiche makyng an othe and promyse to the erle, submitted himself
whole to his ordre and commaundement. For the erle of Richemond .ii.
daies before made to him promes y• if he woulde sweare to take his part
and be obedient to hym, he woulde make hym chiefe gouernour of Wales,
whiche parte as he feithfully promised and graunted, so after that
he had obteyned and possessed the realme and diademe, he liberally performed
and accomplished the same. In the meane tyme, the messenge
                     •
                  s
that were sent, diligently executed the thinges geuen to theim in charge,
and laden with rewardes of theim to whome thei were sent, retourned to
hym thesame daye that he entred into Shrewsburie, and made relacion

to hym that his frendes were ready in all poyntes to do all thynges for
him which either thei ought or might do. The erle Hēry brought in good
hope with his pleasaunt message continued foorth his entended iourney
and came to a litle towne called Newporte and pitchynge his campe
on a lytle hill adioynynge, reposed hym selfe there that nyghte. In
the euenynge, thesame daie came to hym Sir George Talbott wyth
the whole powre of the younge Earle of Shrewsburye then beynge
in warde, whiche were accompted to the nombre of twoo thousande
men. And thus his powre encreasynge he arryued at the towne of
Stafforde and there pawsed. To whome came Sir Wyllyam Stanley
accompaignied with a fewe persones, and after that the Earle and
he had communed no longe tyme together, he reuerted to his souldioures
whiche he had congregate together to serue the Earle, whiche from
thence departed to Lichefelde and laie withoute the walles in his camp
all the nyght. The nexte morenynge he entred into the towne, and was
with all honour lyke a prynce receaued. A daie or twoo before the lorde
Stanley hauynge in hys bande almoste fyue thousande men, lodged in
thesame towne, but herynge that the Earle of Richemonde was marshynge
thetherward, gaue to hym place, dislodgynge hym and hys,
and repaired to a towne called Adrestone, there abydynge the commynge
of the Earle, and this wilye foxe did this acte to aduoyde al suspicion,
beynge afraied least yf he shoulde be sene openly to bee a fautoure
or ayder to the Earle his sonne in lawe before the daie of the battayll,
that kynge Richarde whiche yet dyd not vtterly put in him diffidence
and mystruste woulde put to some cruell deathe his sonne and
heire apparaunt George Lorde Straunge whome kynge Rycharde
as you haue heard before kept with hym as a pledge or hostage to thentent
that the lorde Stanley his father shoulde attempte nothing preiudiciall
to hym.
               Kynge Rycharde at this ceason kepynge his howse in the Castell
of Notyngham was infourmed that the Earle of Richemond with such
bannysshed men as fled oute of Englande to hym were nowe arryued
in Wales, and that all thynges necessarie to his entreprice were
vnprouided, vnpurueyed and verie weake, nothynge mete to withstande
the powre of suche as the kyng had apoynted to resiste him. This
rumour so enflated his minde, that in maner disdeignyng to here speake
of so poore a compaignye, determined at the first to take lytle or no regarde
to this so small a sparcle, declarynge the Earle to be innocente
and vnwyse because that he temerariously attempted suche a great entreprice
with so small and thynne a nombre of Warlyke persones, and
therefore he gaue a definityue sentence, that when he came to that
poynte that he shoulde be compelled to fight agaynst his will, he eyther
shoulde be apprehended a lyue, or elles by all likelyhode he shoulde of
necessite come to a shamefull confusion, and that he trusted to be shortely
done by Sir Walter Harbert and Rice ap Thomas, whiche then

ruled Wales with egall powre and lyke aucthoritee. But yet he reuoluynge
and castynge in hys mynde that a small warre begonne and
wynked at and not regarded, maye tourne to a greate broyle and tumulteous
trouble, and that yftwas prudente pollecie not to asperne and
disdeyne the lytle small powre and weakenes of the ennemye, be yt
neuer so small, thought yt necessarye to prouyde for after clappes that
might happen and chaunce. Wherefore he sent to Ihon duke of Norfolke,
Henry earle of Northumberlande, Thomas Earle of Surrey
and to other of hys especiall and trusty frendes of the nobilite, whyche
he iudged muche more to preferre and esteme his wealthe and honoure
then their awne riches and priuate commodite, willynge theim to mustre
and viewe al their seruauntes and tenentes, and to elect and choose
the moost courageous and actiue persones of the whole nomber, and
with theim to repaire to his presence with all spede and diligence. Also
he wrote to Robert Brakenbury Lieutenaunt of the towre, commaundynge
hym with his powre to come to his armye and to brynge
with hym as felowes in armes Sir Thomas Butchier and sir Walter
Hungerforde and diuerse other knightes and esquiers in whome he had
cast no small suspicion. While he was thus ordrynge his affaires, tydynges
came that the Earle of Richemond was passed Seuerne and
come to Shrewsbury withoute any detrymente or encombreaunce. At
whiche message he was sore moued and broyled wyth Melancolye and
doloure, and cried out, askynge vengeaunce of theim that contrarye to
their othe and promes had fraudulently deceaued hym. For whyche
cause he beganne to haue diffidence in other, in so muche that he determined
hym selfe oute of hand thesame daye to occurre and resyste hys
aduersaries. And in all hast sente oute explorators to viewe and espie
what waie his enemies kept and passed. They dilygentely doynge
their dewtie, shortely after retourned, declarynge to the kyng that the
Earle was encamped at the toune of Lichfelde. When he had perfighte
knowlege where the Earle with his armye was soiournynge,
he hauynge continuall repaire of his subiectes to hym, beganne in contynently
withoute delaie to marshall and collocate in order his battailes
(lyke a valyaunt capteine and polletique leader) and firste he made
his battayles to set forward foure and foure in a ranke, marchynge towarde
that waie where his enemyes as was to hym reported entended
to passe. In the myddle parte of the armye he appoynted the trafficke
and cariage apperteignynge to the armye. Then he (enuironed
with his satellytes and yomen of the crowne (with a frownynge countenaunce
and truculente aspect mounted on a greate whyte courser, folowed
with his footemen, the wynges of horsemen coastynge and rangynge
on euery syde: And kepyng this araye, he with greate pompe
entred the toune of Lecester after the sonne set. The Earle of Rychmonde
reised his campe and departed from Lychefelde to the towne of
Tomwoorth therto nere adioynynge, and in the myd waie passynge,

there saluted hym Sir Walter Hungerforde and Sir Thomas Burchier
knightes and dyuerse other whiche yelded and submitted theim
selfes to his pleasure. For they beynge aduertised that kynge Rycharde
had theim in suspicion and gealosye, a lytle beyonde stony stratforde
left and forsooke prcuely their Capteyne Robert Brakenbury, and by
nocturnall wandryng, and in maner by vnknowen p
                     •
                  thes and vncerteine
waies searchyng, at the last came to the earle Henry. Diuerse other
noble p
                     •
                  rsonages whiche inwardely hated kynge Richard worsse then
a toade or a serpent, lykewyse resorted to hym wyth all their powre and
strength. There happened in this progression to the Earle of Richmond
a straunge chaunce worthy to be noted: for albeit that he was a
man of hau
                     •
                  e and valyaunte courage, and that his army encreased, and
dayly more &amp; more he waxed puysaunt &amp; stronger, yet he was not a lytle
afeard because he in no wise coulde be assured of his father inlawe
Thomas Lorde Stanley, whiche for feare of the destruction of the
Lorde straunge his sonne (as you haue heard) as yet enclyned to neyther
partie. For yf he had gone to the Earle, and that notefied to kynge
Rychard, his sonne had shortely been executed. Wherefore syth the
Earles feare sprange not of nothynge, he accompaignyed with twenty
lyght horsemen lyngered in his iourney as a man disconsolate, musyng
and ymagenynge what was best to be done. And the more to aggrauate
his melancoly pensyuenes, yt was shewed hym that kynge Rycharde
was at hand with a stronge powre and a populous armye.
Whyle he thus pensyue dragged behynde his hoost, the whole armye
came before the toune of Tomwoorth, and when he for the depe darcknes
coulde not perceaue the steppes of theim that passed on before,
and had wandred hether and thether, sekynge after his compaygnie
and yet not once herynge any noyse or whysperynge of theim, he dyuerted
to a very lytle village beynge aboute .iii. myles from his armye,
takynge greate thought and muche fearynge least he shoulde be espied,
and so trapped by kynge Rychardes skoute watche. There he taried
all nyght, not once auenturynge to aske or demaunde a question
of any creature, he beynge no more amased wyth the ieopardye and
perell that was passed, then wyth thys presente chaunce, sore feared
that it shoulde bee a pronosticacion or prodygall sygne of some infortunate
plague afterward to succede. As he was not mery beynge
absent from hys compaignie, lykewyse his armie muche marueled and
no lesse mourned for his sodeyne and intempestious absence.
               The next morenynge early in the dawnynge of the daye he retourned,
and by the conduyte of good fortune espied and came to his armie,
excusynge hym selfe, not to haue gone oute of hys waye by ignoraunce,
but for a pollecie deuysed for the nones he went from his campe
to receau
                     •
                   some glad message from ecrteyne of hys preuy frendes and
secret alies. This excuse made, he preuely departed agayn from his host
to the toune of Aderstone, where the lorde Stanley and sir William his

brother with their bandes were abidynge. There the Earle came firste
to his fatherinlawe in a lytle close, where he saluted hym and Sir William
his brother, and after diuerse congratulacions and many frendely
embracynges, eache reioysed of the state of other, and sodeinly were surprised
with great ioye, comfort and hope of fortunate successe in all their
affaires and doynges. Afterward they consulted together howe to geue
battaile to kynge Richarde yf he woulde abide, whome they knewe not
to be farre of with an houge army. In the euenynge of thesame daye sir
Ihon Sauage, Sir Bryan Sanforde, Sir Symon Digby and many
other leuyng kyng Richarde, turned and came to the parte of the erle
of Richmond with an elect company of men. Whiche refusall of kyng
Richardes parte by men of suche experience, did augment and encreace
bothe the good hope and the puissaunce of the erle of Richmond.
               In the mean ceason kyng Richard (whiche was appoynted nowe to
finyshe his last laboure by the very deuyne iustice and prouidence of
God, whiche called him to condigne punyshemente for his scelerate merites
and myscheueous desertes) marshed to a place mete for twoo battayles
to encountre by a village called Bosworth, not farre from Leycester▪
and there he pitched his felde, refreshed his souldioures and toke
his rest. The fame went that he had thesame night a dreadfull &amp; a terrible
dreame,The dreame of kyng Richard the .iii. for yt semed to hym beynge a slepe y• he sawe diuerse ymages
lyke terrible deuelles whiche pulled and haled hym, not sufferynge
hym to take any quyet or rest. The whiche straunge vision not so
sodeinly strake his heart with a sodeyne feare but it stuffed his hed and
troubled his mynde with many dreadfull and busy Imaginacions.
               For incontynent after, his heart beynge almost damped, he pronosticated
before the doubtfull chaunce of the battaile to come, not vsynge
the alacrite and myrth of mynde and of countenaunce as he was accustomed
to do before he came toward the battaile. And least that it might
be suspected that he was abasshed for feare of his enemyes, and for that
cause looked so piteously, he recyted and declared to hys famylyer
frendes in the morenynge hys wonderfull visyon and terrible dreame.
But I thynke this was no dreame, but a punccion and pricke
of hys synfull conscyence, for the conscience is so muche more charged
and aggrauate as the offence is greater &amp; more heynous in degree,
whiche prycke of conscience allthough it strike not all waye, yet at the
last daie of extreme life it is wonte to shew and represent to vs our faultes
and offences and the paynes and punishementes whiche hand ouer
our heddes for the cōmittyng of thesame, to thentent that at y• instant we
for our desertes being penitent &amp; repentaūt may bee cōpelled lamētyng
&amp; bewalyng our sinnes like forsakers of this worlde, iocund to departe
out of this miserable life. Now to retorne againe to oure purpose, y•
next daie after▪ kyng Richard beyng furnished wt men &amp; all abilimētes
of warr, bringyng al his men out of there camp into y• plaine, ordered his
forward in a marueylous lēgth, in which he appointed both horsemen &amp;

footmen to thentēt to emprynte in y• hartes of thē y• loked a farre of, a sodeine
terror &amp; deadlie feare, for y• great multitude of y• armed soldiours:

whome was Thomas erle of Surrey his sonne. After this lōg vātgard
folowed king Richard hī self, wt a strōg cōpaigny of chosen &amp; approued
mē of warr hauyng horsmen for wynges on both y• sides of his battail.
               After y• therle of Richmond was departed from y• cōmunicaciō of his
frends as you haue harde before, he began to be of a better stomake &amp; of
a more valiant courage, &amp; wt al diligēs pitchid his feld iuste by y• cāp of
his enemies, &amp; there he lodgid y• night. In the mornyng

                  e tyme he caused
his men to put on there armure &amp; appareyl thē selfes redy to fight &amp;

in a place indifferently betwene both y• armes) requiryng him wt his mē to

kynges nomber was doble as muche &amp; more.The oraciō of kyng Richard the .iii. When bothe these armies
were thus ordered &amp; al men redy to set forward kyng Richard called
his Cheuetains together &amp; to thē sayde. Most faithfull &amp; assured felowes,
most trusty &amp; welbeloued frendes and elected captains, by whose
wysedome &amp; policie, I haue obteyned the crowne &amp; type of this famous
realme &amp; noble regiō: by whose puissaūce &amp; valiauntnes I haue enioied
&amp; possessed thestate roial &amp; dignite of y•same, maugre y• yl wil &amp; sedicious
attemptes of all my cancarde enemies &amp; insidius aduersaries, by whose
prudēt &amp; politike coūsaill I haue so gouerned my realme, people &amp; subiectes,
y• I haue omitted nothing appertainig to y• office of a iuste prīce,
nor you haue pretermitted nothing belōgyng to y• dewtie of wise &amp; sage
counsailers. So y• I may saie &amp; truely affirme, that your approued fidelite
&amp; tried constancye, maketh me to beleue firmely &amp; thinke, y• I am an
vndoubted kyng &amp; an indubitate prince. And although in y• adepcion &amp;
obteinyng of y• Garlāde, I being seduced &amp; prouoked by sinister coūsail

and diabolical temptaciō did commyt a facynerous and detestable acte.
Yet I haue with strayte penaunce and salt teryes (as I trust) expiated
and clerely purged thesame offence, which abhominable cryme I require
you of frendship as clerely to forget, as I dayly do remember to deplore
and lament thesame. If you wil now diligently cal to remembraunce
in what case and perplexitie we now stand, and in what doubtful perell
we be now intricked? I doubt not but you in hart will thinke and wyth
mouth confesse, that yf euer amitie and faythe preuailed betwene prynce
and subiectes or betwene subiecte and subiecte: or yf euer bond of allegians
obliged the vassall to loue and serue his naturall souereigne
lorde, or yf any obligation of dewtie bounde any prynce to aide and defende
his subiectes? All these loues, bondes and deuties of necessite are
this daie to be experimented, shewed and put in experiēce. For yf wyse
men saie trew, there his some pollycie in gettyng, but muche more in kepyng.
The one beyng but fortunes chaunce, and the other high wyt and
pollicie, for whiche cause, I with you: and you with me, must nedes this
daye take labour and payne to kepe and defende with force, that preheminence
&amp; possession which by your prudent deuises I haue gotten and
obteyned. I doubt not but you knowe, howe the deuell continuall enemie
to humane nature, disturber of concorde and sower of sedicion, hath
entered into the harte of an vnknowen welshman, (whose father I neuer
knew nor hym personally sawe) excitynge hym to aspire and couet oure
realme, crowne and dignitie, and thereof clerely to depryue and spoyle
vs and our posterite: y
                     •
                   se farther how a compaigny of traytors, thefes,
outlawes and ronneagates of our awne nacion be ayders &amp; partakers
of his feate and enterprise, redy at hand to ouercomme and oppresse vs:
You se also, what a nōber of beggerly Britons &amp; faynt harted Frenchmen
be with hym arriued to distroy vs our wyfes and children. Which
Imminent mischifes &amp; apparaunt incōueniences, if we wil withstond &amp;
refel, we must liue to gether like brethern, fight together like liōs, &amp; feare
not to dye together lyke men. And obseruyng and kepyng this rule and
precept, beleue me, the fearefull hare neuer fledde faster before the gredy
greyhoūd, nor y• sylye larke before y• sparowhauke, nor the symple shepe
before the rauenous wolfe, then your proud bragging aduersaries astō
                  ned
&amp; amased with y• only sight of your manly visages, wil flee, ronne &amp;
skyr out of the felde. For yf yow consider and wisely ponder althings in
your mynde, you shall perceyue that we haue manifest causes, and apparant
tokens of triumph and victorie. And to begyn with the earle of
Richmond Captaine of this rebellion, he is a Welsh mylkesoppe, a mā
of small courage and of lesse experience in marcyall actes and feates of
warr, brought vp by my brother meanes and myne like a captiue in a
close cage in the court of Fraunces duke of Britaine, and neuer saw armie,
nor was exercised in marcial affaires, by reason whereof he neyther
can nor is able on his awne wit or experience to guyde or rule an hoste.
For in the wyt and pollecie of the capitaine, consisteth the chefe adeption

of the victorie and ouerture of the enemyes. Secondarely feare not and
put a waie all doubtes, for when y• traitors &amp; runagates of our realme,
shall see vs wt banner displaied come against them, remēbryng there oth
promise &amp; fidelitie made vnto vs, as to ther souereigne lord &amp; anoynted
kyng, thei shal be so pricked &amp; stimulate in y• botome of there scrupulous
consciences y• thei for very remorce &amp; dread of y• diuine plage will ethe
                     •
                  
shamefully flye, or humbly submitte them selfes to out grace and marcie.
And as for the Frenshmē &amp; Brytons▪ there valiātnes ys suche, y• our
noble progenitors &amp; your valiaunt parētes, haue them oftener vāquished
&amp; ouercome in one moneth, then thei in y• beginny
                     •
                  g imagened possible

wtout audacite dronkards wtout discrescion, rybaudes wtout reason,

people, y• euer shewed them selfes in Frunt of battaile, ten tymes
more coragious to fly &amp; escape then ons to assaut y• brest of our stronge &amp;
populous army. Wherfore, consideryng al these auaūtages, expell out
of your thoughts al doutes &amp; avoide out of your mindes al feare, &amp; like
valiaunt chāpions auaūce furth your standards, &amp; assaye whither your
enemies can decide &amp; trie y• title of battaile by dent of swerde, auaunce (I
say againe) forward my captains, in whome lacketh neither pollicie wisdome
nor puissaunce. Euery one gyue but one suer stripe, &amp; suerly y• iorney
is ours. What preuayleth a hādfull to a hole realme? desiryng you
for y• loue y• you beare to me, &amp; y• affeccion y• you haue to your natiue and
naturall coūtrey, &amp; to y• sauegard of your prince &amp; your selfe, y• you wyll
this day take to you your accustumed corage, &amp; couragious spirites for
y• defence &amp; sauegard of vs all. And as for me, I assure you, this daye I
wil triūphe by glorious victorie, or suffer death for immortal fame. For
thei be ma

which do not as much preferre &amp; exaltey• perpetual honor of their natiue
coūtrey, as ther awne mortal &amp; transitorie life. Now sent George to
borowe, let vs set forwarde, &amp; remēber wel y• I am he which shal wt high
auauncementes, rewarde &amp; preferre y• valiaunt &amp; hardy chāpions, &amp; punishe
and turment the shameful cowardes &amp; dreadfull dastardes. This
exhortacion encouraged all such as faroured hym, but suche as were
present more for dreade then loue, kyssed thē openly, whome thei in wardely
hated other sware outwardely to take part with suche, whose death
thei secretely compassed and inwardly imagened, other promysed to inuade
the kynges enemies, whiche fled and fought with fyrce courage against
the kyng: other stode stil &amp; loked on, entendynge to take parte wt
the victors and ouercommers: So was his people to hym vnsure and
vnfaithfull at his ende▪ as he was to his nephewes vntrew and vnnaturall
in his beginnyng.
               When therle of Richmond knewe by his forriders that the kyng was
so nere embattayled, he rode about his armye, from ranke to ranke,

from wyng so wyng, geuyng comfortable wordes to all men, and that
finyshed (heynge armed at all peces sauyng his helmet) mounted on a
lytell hyll so that all his people myght se and beholde hym perfitly to
there great reioysyng: For he was a man of no great stature, but so formed
and decorated with all gyftes and lyniamentes of nature that he
semed more an angelicall creature then a terrestriall personage, his coū
                  tenaunce
and aspecte was cherefull and couragious, his heare yelow
lyke the burnished golde, his eyes gray shynynge and quicke, prompte
and redye in aunswerynge, but of suche sobrietie that it coulde neuer
be iudged whyther he ware more dull then quicke in speakynge (suche
was hys temperaunce.) And when he had ouer loked hys army ouer
euery syde, he pawsed a while, and after with a lowde voyce and bolde
spirite spake to his compaignions these or lyke wordes folowyng.
               If euer GOD gaue victorie to men fyghtynge in a iust quarell?The oraciō of kyng Henry the .vii.
or yf he euer ayded suche as made warre for the welthe and tuycyon of
ther awne naturall and nutritiue countrey? or if he euer succoured them
whyche aduentured there lyues for the relefe of innocentes, suppressynge
of malefactores and apparaunt offenders? No doubt my felowes
and frendes, but he of hys bountefull goodnes wyll this daye fende
vs triumphaunt victorye and a luckey iourney ouer our prowde enemyes,
and arrogant aduersaries: for yf you remember and consider
the very cause of our iust quarell, you shall apparantlye perceyue the
same to be trewe, Godly, and vertuous. In the whiche I doubte not
but GOD wyll rather ayde vs (ye and fyght for vs) then se vs vanquished
and profligate by suche as neyther feare hym nor his lawes,
nor yet regarde iustice or honestie. Our cause is so iuste that no enterprice
can be of more vertue, bothe by the lawes diuine and 
                     •
                  iuile, for
what can be a more honest, goodly, or Godly quarell then to fight
agaynste a Capitayne, beynge an homicide and mutderer of hys awne
bloude and progenye? An extreme destroyer of hys nobylytie, and
to hys and oure countrey and the poore subiectes of the same, a deadly
malle a fyrye brande and a burden vntollerable? beyde hym, consyder
who be of his bande and compaignye, suche as by murther
and vntreuthe committed agaynste there awne kynne and lynage,
ye agaynste theyr Prynce and souereygne Lorde haue disheryted me
and you and wrongefully deteyne and vsurpe ouer lawefull patrymonye
and lyneall inherytaunce. For he that calleth hym selfe kynge,
kepeth from me the Crowne and regymente of this noble realme
and countrey contrarye to all iustice and equitie. Lykewyse, hys mates
and frendes occupie your landes cutt downe your woddes and destroy
your manners, lettynge your wifes and children range a brode for
ther liuyng: which persones for ther penaunce and punishment I doute
not but GOD of his goodnes will eyther deliuer into our handes as
a great gayne and booty, or cause them beinge greued and compuncted

with the pricke of ther corrupt consciences cowardely to flye and not abyde
the battaill: besyde this I assure you that there be yonder in that
great battaill, men brought thyther for feare and not for loue, souldiours
by force compelled and not wt good will assembled: persons which
desyer rather the destruccion then saluacion of ther master and captayn:
And fynally a multitude: wherof the most parte will be our frendes and
the lest parte our enemies. For truely I dout whiche is greater the malice
of the souldiours towarde there captain, or the feare of hym conceyued
of his people: for suerly this rule ys infallible, that as il men daily
couyte to destroy the good, so God appoynteth the good to confounde
the yll, and of all worldly goodes the greatest ys, to suppresse tirauntes,
and releue innocences, wherof the one is euer as muche hated as y• other
ys beloued. If this be trewe (as clerkes preche) who will spare younder
tyraunt Richard duke of Gloucester vntrewely callyng hym self kyng,
consideryng that he hath violated, and broken bothe the lawe of God &amp;
man, what vertue is in hym whiche was the confusion of hys brother
and murtherer of his nephewes? what mercy is in hym that sleythe hys
trustie frendes aswell as his extreme enemyes? Who can haue confidēs
in him which putteth diffidens in all mē? Yf you haue not redde, I haue
hard of clerckes saie, y• Tarquyne y• proude for the vice of the body lost
the kyngdome of Rome, and the name of Tarquyne bannyshed the Citee
for euer: yet was not his fault so detestable as the facte of cruel Nero,
whiche s
                     •
                  ew his awne mother and opened her entrayles to be holde
the place of his conception. Beholde younder Richarde whiche is bothe
Tarquine and Nero: Ye a tyraūt more then Nero, for he hath not only
murdered his nephewe beyng his kyng and souereigne lorde, bastarded
his noble brethern and defamed the wombe of his verteous and womanly
mother, but also compased all the meanes and waies y• he coulde
inuent how to stupra
                     •
                  e and carnally know his awne nece vnder the pretence
of a cloked matrimony, whiche lady I haue sworne and promysed
to take to my make and wyfe as you all know and beleue. If this cause
be not iuste, and this quarel Godly, let God the geuer of vyctorie iudge
and determine. We haue (thankes be geuen to Christe) escaped y• secrete
treasons in Brytaine, and auoyded the subtyll snares of our fraudulēt
enemies there, passed the troublous sees in good and quiet sauegarde, &amp;
with out resistence haue penetrate the ample region and large countrey
of Wales, and are now comme to the place whiche we so much desyred,
for long we haue sought the furious bore, and now we haue found him.
Wherfore, let vs not feare to enter in to the toyle where we may suerly
sley hym, for God knoweth y• we haue liued in the vales of myserie, tossyng
oure shippes in daungerous stormes: let vs not now dread to set
vp our sailes in fayre wether hauyng with vs bothe hym and good fortune.
If we had come to conquer Wales and had acheued yt, our praise
had bene great, and our gayne more? but yf we wyn this battaill y• hole
riche realme of England with the lordes and rulers of the same shall be

oures, the profit shall be oures and the honour shall be oures. Therfore
labour for your gayne and swet for your right: while we were in Brytaine
we had small liuynges and lytle plentye of welthe or welfare, now
is the tyme come to gett abundaunce of riches and copie of profit which
is the rewarde of your seruice and merite of your payne. And this remē
                  ber
with your selues, that before vs be our ennemies, and on ether syde
of vs be suche as I nether suerly trust, nor greatly beleue, backwarde
we cannot fly: So that here we stande like shepe in a folde circumcepted
and cōpassed betwene our enemies and our doubtful frendes. Therefore
let all feare be set a syde and lyke sworne brethern let vs ioyne in
one, for this daie shalbe thende of our trauayle and the gaine of our labour
eyther by honorable death or famous victory: And as I trust, the
battaill shall not be so sowre as y• profyt shalbe swete. Remember y• victorie
is not gotten with the multitude of men, but with the courages of
hartes and valiauntnes of myndes. The smaller that our nombre is, the
more glorie is to vs yf we vanquishe, if we be ouercome, yet no laude is
to be attributed, to the victors, consyderyng that .x. men fought agaynst
one: and yf we dye so glorious a death in so good a quarell, nether fretyng
tynne, nor cancarding obliuiō shal be able to obfuscate or race out
of the boke of fame ether our names or our Godly attempte. And this
one thyng I assure you, that in so iuste and good a cause, and so notable
a quarell, you shall fynde me this daye, rather a dead carion vppon the
coold grounde▪ then a fre prisoner on a carpett in a laydes chamber. Let
vs therfore fight like inuincible gyantes, &amp; set on our enemies like vntimerous
Tigers &amp; banish all feare like rāping lions. And now auaūce
torward trew men against traytors pitifull persones against murtherers,
trew inheritors against vsurpers, y• skorges of God against tiraū
                  tes,
display my banner with a good courage, marche furth like stronge
&amp; robustious champions, &amp; begyn y• battaill like hardy conquerers, the
battaill is at hande, &amp; y• victorie approcheth, &amp; yf we shamfully recule or
cowardly flye, we and all our sequele be destroyd &amp; dishonored for euer.
This is y• daie of gayne, &amp; this is y• time of losse, get this daie victorie &amp;
be cōquerers, &amp; lese this daies battail &amp; be villains &amp; therfore in y• name
of god &amp; saīct George let euery mā coragiosly auaūce forth his stādard.
               These cherefull wordes he sett forthe with suche gesture of his body
and smylyng coūtenaunce, as though all redye he had vanquyshed hys
enemies and gotten the spoyle.
               He had scantly finyshed his saienge,The battaile betwene kyng Richard and kyng Henry the .vii. but the one armye espyed the other,
lord how hastely the souldioures 
                     •
                  uckled their healmes, how quikly
the archers bent ther bowes and frushed theire feathers, how redely y•
byllmen shoke there bylles and proued there staues, redy to approche &amp;
ioyne when the terrible trompet should sownde the bluddy blast to victorie
or deathe. Betwene bothe armies ther was a great marrysse which
therle of Richemond left on his right hand, for this entent that it should
be on that syde a defence for his parte, and in so doyng he had the sonne

at his backe and in the faces of his enemies. When kynge Richard saw
the earles compaignie was passed the marresse, he commaunded with al
hast to sett vpon them, then the trompettes blew &amp; the souldiours showted
and the kyngs archers couragious
                     •
                  y let fly there arrowes, the erles
bowmē stode not still but paied thē home againe. The terrible shot ons
passed, the armies ioyned, &amp; came to hande strokes, where nother swerde
nor byll was spared, at whiche encounter the lord Stanley ioyned with
therle. The erle of Oxforde in the meane season feryng lest while his cō
                  paignie
was fightyng, thei should be compassed &amp; circūuented wt y• multitude
of his enemies, gaue cōmaūdemēt in euery ranke y• no mā should
be so hardy as go aboue .x. fote from y• standard, whiche cōmanndement
ons knowen, thei knyte thē selfes together, &amp; ceased a littel frō fightyng:
the aduersaries sodainly abashed at the matter, and mystrustynge some
fraude or deceate, began also to pause and left strikyng, and not against
the wylles of many whiche had leuer haue had the kyng destroyed then
saued, and therfore thei fought very faintlye or stode stil. Therle of Oxforde
bryngyng all his bend togither on the one parte, set on his ennemies
freshly, agayne, the aduersaries perceiuyng that, placed ther men
slender and thyne before and thicke and brode behynde, begynnynge againe
hardely the battaill. While the two forwardes thus mortallye
fought, eche entendyng to vanquishe &amp; conuince ye other, Kyng Richard
was admonished by his explorators and espialles, y• therle of Richmōd
accompaignied with a small nomber of men of armes was not farre of,
&amp; as he approched and marched toward him, he perfitely knew his personage
by certaine demonstracions &amp; tokens whiche he had learned and
knowen of other. And being inflamed with ire and vexed wt outragious
malice, he put his spurres to his horse &amp; rode out of the syde of y• range
of his battaile, leuyng the auantgardes fightyng, &amp; lyke a hungery lion
ran with spere in rest toward hym. Therle of Richmonde perceyued wel
the kyng furiusly commyng towarde him, and by cause the hole hope of
his welth and purpose was to be determined by battaill, he gladlye proferred
to encountre with hym body to body and man to man. Kyng Rychard
sett on so sharpely at the first Broūt y• he ouerthrew therles standarde,
and slew Sir William Brandon his standarde bearer (whiche
was father to sir Charles Brandon by kynge Hēry y• .viii. created duke
of Suffolke) and matched hand to hand wt sir Ihon Cheinye, a man of
great force &amp; strength which would haue resisted hym, &amp; the saied Ihon
was by hym manfully ouerthrowen, and so he makyng open passage by
dent of swerde as he went forwarde, therle of Richmond with stode his
violence and kept hym at the swerdes poincte without auantage longer
then his compaignions other though or iudged, which beyng almost in
dispaire of victorie, were sodainly recomforted by Sir William Stanley,
whiche came to succours with .iii. thousande tall men, at whiche very
instant kynge Richardes men were dryuen backe and fledde, and he
him selfe manfully fyghtynge in the mydell of his enemies was slayne

and brought to his death as he worthely had deserued.
               In the meane season therle of Oxforde with the aide of the Lorde
Stanley, after no long fight disconfited the forward of kyng Rychard,
whereof a greate nomber were slayne in the chace and flight, but the
greatest nomber whiche (compelled by feare of the kyng and not of there
mere voluntarie mocion) came to the feld, gaue neuer a stroke, and hauyng
no harme nor domage sauely departed, whiche came not thyther in
hope to se the kynge prosper and preuaile, but to here that he shoulde be
shamefully confounded and brought to ruyne.
               In this battaill died fewe aboue the nomber of a thousande persones:
And of the nobilitie were slayne Ihon Duke of Norfolke, whiche
was warned by dyuers to refrayne from the felde, in so muche that
the nyghte before he shoulde set forwarde towarde the kynge, one wrote
on his gate.

                     Iack of Norffolke be not to bolde
                     For Dykon thy maister is bought and solde.
                  
Yet all this notwithstandynge he regarded more his othe, his honour
and promyse made to kynge Richarde, lyke a gentleman and a faythefull
subiecte to his prynce absented not hym selfe from hys mayster, but
as he faythefully lyued vnder hym, so he manfully dyed with hym to
hys greate fame and lawde. There were slayne besyde hym water lorde
Ferrers of Chartley, Sir Rychard Ratclyffe, and Robert Brakenburie
Leutenaunt of the Tower and not many gentlemen mo. Sir Willyam
Catesbey learned in the lawes of the realme, and one of the cheffe counsailers
to the late kynge, with diuers other were ▪ii. daies after behedded
at Leycester. Amongest them that ranne awaie were Sir Fraunces Uicou
                     •
                  t
louell and Humfrey Stafforde and Thomas Stafford his brother
which toke sanctuary in saynct Ihones at Gloucester. Of captiues
and prysoners there was a greate nomber, for after the deathe of kynge
Rycharde was knowen and publyshed, euery man in manner vnarmynge
hym selfe and castynge a waye his abilimentes of warre, mekely
submitted them selfes to the obeyssaunce and rule of therle of Richemond:
of the whiche the more parte had gladly so done in the beginnynge
yf they myght haue conueniently escaped from kyng Richardes
espialles, whiche hauynge as clere eyes as lynx and as open eares as
Mydas rāged and serched in euery quarter. Amongest these was Henry
the .iiii. erle of Northumberlande, whiche whither it was by the commaundement
of kyng Rycharde puttynge diffidens in hym, or he dyd it
for the loue &amp; fauor that he bare vnto the Earle, stode still with a greate
compaignie &amp; intermitted not in the battaill, whiche was incontinently
receyued in to fauour and made of the counsail. But Thomas Haward
erle of Surrey whiche submitted hym selfe ther, was not taken to grace
by cause his father was cheffe coūsailer &amp; he greatly familiar with kyng
Richard, but cōmitted to the Tower of Londō, where he long remained
&amp; in conclusion deliuered, &amp; for his treuth and fidelity after promoted to

high honors offices &amp; dignites. On therle of Richmōds part were slain

                  scace
one hundred persones, amongest whome the pryncipall was Sir
William Brandon his standard bearer.
               This battaill was fought at Bosworth in Leycester shire the .xxii.
daye of August in the yere of our redempcion a .M.CCCC.lxxxvi. the
hole conflicte endured lyttell aboue twoo howres. Kyng Richard as the
fame wente might haue escaped and gotten sauegarde by fliynge. For
when thei whiche were next about his person saw and perceyued at the
first ioynyng of the battaill the

drewe them selfes pryuely out of the prease and departed. They beganne
to suspect fraude and to smell treason, and not only exhorted but determinatly
aduysed hym to saue hym selfe by flyght: and when the losse
of the battayle was imminent and apparante, they brought to hym a
swyfte and a lyght horse to conuey hym awaie. He which was not ignorant
of y• grudge &amp; yll will y• the cōmō people bare towarde him, casting
awaye all hope of fortunate successe &amp; happy chaūce to come, answered
(as men saye) that on that daye he woulde make an ende of all battailes
or els ther finyshe his lyfe. Suche a great audacitie &amp; such a s
                     •
                  owte stomake
reigned in his body, for suerly he knew y• to be the day in the which
it should be decided &amp; determined whither he should peaseably obteyne
&amp; enioye his kyngdom duryng his lyfe, or els vtterly for go &amp; be depryued
of the same, with which to much hardines he beyng ouercome hastely
closed his helmett, and entered fiercely in to the hard battail, to thentent
to obteine that day a quiet reigne &amp; regiment or els to finyshe there
his vnquiet life &amp; vnfortunate gouernaūce. And so this miser at y• same
very poinct had like chaunce &amp; fortune, as happeneth to suche whiche in
place of right iustice &amp; honestie folowyng ther sensuall appetite, loue, vse,
and embrace, mischiefe, tiranny, and vnthriftines. Suerly these be examples
of more vehemencye then mans tonge can expresse, to feare and
astūne suche yuell persones as wil not lyue one houre vacant frō doyng
and exercisyng crueltie myschiefe or outragious liuyng.
               When therle had thus obteigned victorie and slaine his mortal enemie,
he kneled doune and rendred to almighie God his harty thākes wt
deuoute &amp; Godly orisons, besechyng his goodnes to sende hym grace to
auaunce &amp; defende the catholike fayth &amp; to mayntaine iustice &amp; cōcorde
amōgest his subiectes &amp; people, by God now to his gouernaūce cōmitted
&amp; assigned: Which praier finyshed, he replenyshed wt incomperable
gladnes, ascended vp to the topp of a littell mountaine, where he not only
praysed &amp; lawded his valiaunt souldiours, but also gaue vnto theim
his harty thankes, wt promyse of cōdigne recompen
                     •
                  e for their fidelite &amp;
valiaūt factes, willyng &amp; commaundyng al the hurt &amp; woūded persones
to be cured, and the dead carcases to be deliuered to y• sepulture. Then y•
people reioysed &amp; clapped hādes criyng vp to heauen, king Henry, king
Henry. When the lord Stanley sawe the good will and gratuite of the

people he toke the crowne of kynge Richard whiche was founde amongest
the spoyle in the felde, and sett it on therles hed, as though he had
byne elected kyng by the voyce of the people as in auncient tymes past
in diuers realmes it hath been accustomed, and this was the first signe
and token of his good lucke and felicite. I must put you here in remembraunce
howe that kynge Richarde puttynge some diffidence in the lord
Stanley, which had wt hym as an hostage, the lorde straunge his eldest
sonne, which lord Stanley as you haue hearde before ioyned not at the
firste with his sonne in lawes armye, for feare that kynge Rycharde
woulde haue slayne the Lorde Straunge his heyre. When kynge Rycharde
was come to Boswoorth, he sent a purseuaūt to the lord Stanley,
commaundyng hym to auaunce forward with hys compaignie and
to come to his presence, whiche thynge yf he refused to do, he sware by
Christes passion that he woulde stryke of his sonnes hedde before he dined.
The lorde Stanley aunswered the pursiuaunt that yf the kynge
dyd so, he had more sonnes a lyue, and as to come to hym he was not
then so determined: when kynge Richarde harde this aunswere he commaunded
the lorde Straunge incontinent to be behedded, whiche was
at that very same season when bothe the armyes had sight eche of other.
The counsaillers of kyng Rycharde ponderyng the time and the cause,
knowynge also the Lorde Straunge to be innocente of his fathers offence,
perswaded the kynge that it was now tyme to fight and not tyme
to execucion, aduisynge hym to kepe the Lorde Straunge as a prisoner
tyll the battayll were ended, and then at Leyser his pleasure myght
be accomplished. So as God woulde kynge Rycharde enfrynged hys
holy othe, and the Lorde was deliuered to the kepers of the kynges tentes
to be kept as a prisoner, whyche when the felde was done and their
master slayne and proclamacion made to knowe where the childe was,
thei, submitted them selfes as prysoners to the Lord Straunge, and he
gently receyued them and brought them to the newe proclamed kyng,
where of hym and of his Father he was receyued with greate ioye and
gladnes. After this the hole campe remoued wyth bagg and baggage
and thesame nyght in the euenyng kynge Henry with great Pompe came
to the towne of Leycester. Where aswell for the refreshynge of his
people and souldioures as for preparynge all thynges necessarie for
hys iourney towarde London, he rested and reposed hym selfe twoo
dayes. In the meane season the deade corps of kynge Rycharde
was as shamefully caryed to the towne of Leycester, as he gorgiously
the daye before with pompe and pryde departed owte of thesame
towne. For his bodye was naked and despoyled to the skyne, and nothynge
left aboue hym not so muche as a clowte to couer hys pryue
members, and was trussed behynde a pursiuaunt of armes called
blaunche senglier or whyte bore, lyke a hogge or a calfe, the hed and
armes hangynge on the one syde of the horse, and the legges on
the other syde, and all by spryncled wyth myre and bloude, was

brought to the graye fryers church within the toune, and there laie lyke
a miserable spectacle: but suerly consyderyng his mischeuous actes and
Facinorous doynges, men maye worthely wonder at such a caytiue, and
in the sayde church he was with no lesse funeral pompe, and solempnitie
enterred, then he woulde to be done at the beryng of his innocent nephiwes
whome he caused cruellie to be murthered and vnnaturally to be
quelled.
               When his death was knowē, few lamented, &amp; many reioysed, y• proude
braggyng white bore (whiche was his badge) was violently rased and
plucked doune from euery signe and place where it myght be espied, so
yll was his lyfe that men wished the memorie of hym to be buried with
his carren corps: He reigned .ii. yeres .ii. monethes and one daie.
               As he was small and litle of stature so was he of body grraiely deformed,
the one shoulder higher then the other,The discripcion of kyng Richard y• .iii. his face small but his cō

was cruel, and such, that a man at the first aspect would iudge

he woulde byte and chaw besely his nether lippe, as who sayd, that hys
fyerce nature in his cruell bodye alwaies cha

vnquiete: beside that, the dagger that he ware he would when he studied
with his hand plucke vpp and downe in the shethe to the middes, neuer
drawing it fully out, his wit was pregnaunt, quicke and redy, wyly to
fayne and apte to dissimule, he had a proude mynde and an arrogāt stomacke,
the whiche accompaignied him to his death, whiche he rather desyrynge
to suffer by dent of swerde, then beynge forsaken and destitute
of his vntrewe compaignions, woulde by cowarde flight preserue and
saue his vncertaine liffe: Whiche by malice, sickenes or condigne punishement
might chaunce shortly after to comme to confusion.
               Thus ended this prynce his mortall life with infamie and dishonor,
whiche neuer preferred fame or honestie before ambicion tyranny and
myschiefe. And yf he had continued still Protectoure and suffered
his nephewes to haue lyued and reigned, no doubt but the realme
had prospered and he muche praysed and beloued
as he is nowe abhorred and vilipended, but to
God whiche knewe his interior cogitacions
at the hower of his deathe I remitte
the punyshment of
his offences committed
in his
lyfe.
            
         
         
            
            
            The politique gouernaunce
of Kyng Henry the .vii.
            
               COnsideryng now that I haue
sufficiently declared what mischiefe
kyng Richard the third wrought with
in this realme after ye death of his noble
brother kyng Edward the fourth:
and how the nobilite of hys kyngdom
maligned and conspired against hym,
and abandoned and left him in maner
desolate at the day of hys most nede &amp;
tribulaciō: Also how miserable he ended
his lyfe at y• toune of Boswoorth,
and how vnreuerētly he was enterred
at ye toune of Leicestre which I doubt
not but is sufficiently declared vnto you. And now only resteth to shewe
you what happened after his fall and confusion to him, that bothe vanquished
&amp; depriued him from his princely powre &amp; royall dignitie.
            When kyng Henry had not only obteyned this triumphant battaile
at the plain of Boswoorth against his malicious enemy kyng Richard,
but also by the glorious victory gatt the diademe and possession of thestate
royall and princely preheminence of this famous Empire and renoumed
kyngdome. He hauyng both the ingenious forcast of the subtyl
serpent, and also fearyng the burnynge fyre like an infant that is a litle
synged with a small slame: and farther vigilantly forseyng &amp; prudently
prouidyng for doubtes that might accid
                  •
               ntally ensue: deuysed, studyed
and compassed to extirpate and eradicate all interior sedicions &amp; apparant
presumpcions whiche might moue any tumulteous route or sedicious
coniuracion against him within his realme in tyme to come. And
to obsist the first likely mischiefe he sent before his departure from Leycestre
Sir Robert wylloghby knight to the maner of Sheryhutton in
the county of Yorke, for Edward plantagenet Erle of Warwike sonne
and heires to George duke of Clarēce then beyng of the age of .xv. yeres,
whom kyng Richard had kept there as a prysoner durynge the tyme of
his vsurped reigne. And surely ye kyng was not afeard without a cause,
for he much mistrusted least by this yoūge man, some duill disposed and
enuious persones of his glory and auauncemēt might inuent some new
occasion of renuyng of battaill against him, which beyng euen from his
infancy with many encombrances and troubles vexed &amp; endaungered,
desired nothyng more hartely then nowe to lyue in quyetnes, peace and
tranquilite. Sir Robert willoghby accordynge to hys commission receaued
of the conestable of the castle the Erle Edward, and him conueighed

to London, where the youngelynge borne to perpetuall calamitie

that matrimony, but abhorred and detested greatly his abhommable
desyre. At whiche most importunate and detestable cōcupiscence the
cōmon people of the realme so muche grudged and maligned that they
did not only attribute ye faute &amp; cryme to the kyng, but much more culpate
&amp; blame his preuy coūcellers whiche did not dissent, but consent to
so pernicious a counsaill &amp; so shamefull a conclusion: But God of hys
only goodnes preserued y• christē mynde of that verteous &amp; immaculate

            In the meane ceason the kyng remoued forward by iorneyes toward
London and euen as he passed, the rusticall people on euery syde of the
wayes assembled in great nombres &amp; with great ioye clapped their handes

the aucthores of y• mischiefe 
                  •
               ublated &amp; plucked awaye. And with great
pompe &amp; triumphe he roade through the cytie to the cathedral church of
S. Paule wher he offred his .iii. standardes. In the one was the ymage
of S. George, in the secōd was a red firye dragō beaten vpō white and
grene sarcenet, ye third was of yelowe tartern
                  •

               owe. After his praiers saide &amp; Te deum song, he departed to the
bishoppes palays &amp; there soiourned a ceason, duryng whiche tyme, playes,
pastymes &amp; pleasures were shewed in euery parte of the cytie. And
to thentent that their good mynd toward God should not be put in obliuion,
they caused general processiōs solemply to be celebrate to rendre
and yelde to God their creator &amp; redemer their hartye and humble thankes
whiche had deliuered them frō miserable captiuite &amp; restored them
to libertie and fredome. Besyde this, they that fauoured and loued the
kyng were inwardly ioyous to se &amp; perceaue that their aduersaries and
back frendes were all ready or like to be suppeditate &amp; ouerthrowen.
            When these solempnities &amp; grati
                  •
               ications were done &amp; passed: accordyng

as other kynges had been accustomed, he cōgregated together the
sage councelers of his realme, in which coūsail like a prince of iust faith
and true of promes, detestyng all intestine &amp; cyuel hostilite, appoynted a
daye to ioyne in matrimony y• lady Elizabeth heyre of the house of Yorke,
with his noble personage heyre to y• lyne of Lancastre: whiche thyng
not onely reioysed and comforted the hartes of the noble and gentlemen
of the realme, but also gayned the fauour &amp; good myndes of all the cō
               men
people, much extollyng and praysyng the kynges constant fidelyte
and his polletique deuyce, thinkyng surely that the daye was now come
that the seede of tumulteous faccions &amp; the fountayne of ciuyle dissencion
should be stopped, euacuate and clerely extinguished.
            After this, he with great pompe was cōueighed to Westmynster, and
there the thirty daye of Octobre was with all ceremonyes accustomed,
enoynted &amp; crouned kyng by the whole assent aswel of the cōmons as of
the nobilite, &amp; was named kyng Henry the .vij. of that name, which was
in the yere of our redempcion .M.cccc.lxxxvi. Frederyke the .iij. then beynge
Emperour of Almayne, Maximilian his sonne then beyng newely
elected kyng of Romanes, Charles the .viij. reignyng ouer the Frenche
nacion, &amp; Iames the .iii. rulyng the realme of Scotland. Which kyngdome
he obteyned &amp; enioyed as a thyng by God elected &amp; prouided, and
by his especiall fauoure &amp; gracious aspecte compassed and acheued. In
so muche that mē cōmonly reporte that .vii.C.xcvii. yeres passed, it was
by a heauenly voyce reueled to Cadwalader last kyng of Brytons that
his stocke and progeny should reigne in this land and beare domynion
agayn: Wherupō most men were persuaded in their awne opinion that
by this heauenly voyce he was prouided &amp; ordeyned longe before to enioye
and obteine this kyngdom, Whiche thyng kyng Henry the .vi. did
also shewe before as you haue heard declared. Wherefore he beynge by
right and iust tytle of temporall inheritaunce, &amp; by prouision of deuyne
purueyaūce thus crouned and proclaymed kyng: First of all vsyng the
antique example of the Athenienses, whiche is to perdon and put out of
memory all crymes and offences before tyme agaynst hym or his lawes
perpetrated or cōmitted, he called his high courte of parliamēt at Westmynster
the .vii. daye of Nouembre for thestablishyng of all thinges aswell
cōcernyng the preseruacion and maintenaūce of his royall person,
as the admynistracion of iustice and preferment of the cōmon wealth of
this realme and domynion, in thewhich he caused to be proclaymed that
all menne were perdoned, acquyted &amp; clerely discharged of all offences,
peynes of death and execucions, and should be restored to their landes
and mouable goodes whiche would submyt them selfes to his clemency
and by othe be obliged truly to serue and obeye hym as their souereigne
lorde, &amp; who woulde be obstinate &amp; refuse to returne to his parte, should
be accepted and taken as a publike enemy to hym and his countrey. By
reason of which proclamacion, a great nombre that came out of diuerse
sanctuaries and priuileged places obteyned grace, forgettynge clerely

the diuersite of faccions &amp; voyce of partakyng. After this he beganne to
remembre his especiall frendes &amp; fautours, of whome, some he auaunced
to honoure &amp; dignite, &amp; some he enriched with possessions &amp; goodes,
euery mā accordyng to his desert &amp; merite. And to begynne, Iaspar his
vncle Erle of Penbrooke, he created duke of Bedforde, Thomas lorde
Stanley he ꝓmoted to be erle of Darby, &amp; y• lord Chandew of Briteine
his especiall frende he made erle of Bathe, Sir Eyles Dawbeney was
made lord Dawbeney, sir Robert Willoughby was made lord Brooke
which be in their degree bar
                  •
               ns and peeres of the realme. And Edward
stafford eldest sonne to Henry late duke of Buckyngham, he restored to
to his name, dignitie and possessions, whiche kyng Richard dyd cofiscate
and attaynted. Beside this, in this parliamēt was this notable acte
assented to and concluded as foloweth.
            
               To the pleasure of almighty God, wealth prosperite &amp; suretie of this
realme of England, and to the synguler comfort of all the kynges subiectes
of thesame, in aduoydyng all ambiguyties &amp; question
                     •
                  : Be it ordeyned
established and enacted by this present parliamente, that the inheritaūce
of the croune of this realme of England and also of Fraunce
with all the pr

                  hemynēce and dignitie royall to thesame apperteignyng
and all other seigniories to the kyng belongyng beyond the sea with the
appurtenaūces therto in any wyse dewe or apperteignyng, shall rest, remayne
and abyde in the most royall person of our nowe souereigne lord
kyng Henry the .vii. and in the heires of his body lawfully cōmyng, perpetually
with the grace of God so to endure, and in none other.
            
            And beside this acte al attainders of this kyng, enacted by kyng Edward
&amp; kyng Richard were adnichilated, and the recorde of thesame adiudged
to be defaced &amp; put out of memory, and al persons attaynted for
his cause &amp; occasion, were restored to their goodes, landes &amp; possessions.
And in cōclusion, diuerse of the actes made in the tyme of kyng Edward
and kyng Richard were adnulled &amp; reuoked, &amp; other more expedient for
the vtilitie of the cōmen wealth were subrogated and concluded. When
all thynges necessary were discretely ordred and the parliamente for the
tyme dissolued, the kyng thought it not necessary to put in obliuion hys
frendes and hostages beyng beyonde the sea, wherfore with all diligent

                  〈◊〉
                he redemed the Marques Dorcet &amp; sir Ihon Bourch
                  •
               er whom
he had lefte as pledges at Parys for money there before borowed. And
sent also into Flaunders for Ihon Morton bishop of Ely.
            These actes perfourmed, he stablished in his house a graue counsaill
of wyse and pollitique men, by whose iudgement, ordre &amp; determinacion
the people might be gouerned accordyng to iustice and equitie, and that
all causes might be finyshed and ended there, without great bearyng or
expence in longe 
                  •
               ute. And for hearyng &amp; decydynge these causes iustly
and spedely he sware of hys counsaill dyuerse noble and discrete persones
whiche for their pollecy, wytt &amp; synguler grauitie, were highly estemed
and renoumed, whose names folowe, Iaspar duke of Bedfoorde,

Ihon erle of Oxenforde, Thomas Stanley erle of Darby, Ihō bishop
of Ely, Sir Wyllyam Stanley lorde Chamberleyn of his housholde,
Sir Robert Willoughby, lord Brooke, lord Stuard of his houshold,
Gyles lord Dawbeney, Ihon lord Dynham after made tresorer of England,
Sir Reignold Brey, Sir Ihon Cheiney, Sir Richard Guyldforde,
Sir Richard Tunstall, Sir Richard Egecombe, Sir Thomas
Louell, Sir Edward Pownynges, Sir Ihō Risley, with diuerse other
wyse men, whiche as the tyme requyred he called to hys counsayll and
seruyce nowe one and nowe another.
            Although by this eleccion of wyse and graue councellers all thinges
semed to be brought to a good &amp; perfight conclusion, yet there lacked a
wrest to the harpe to set all the strynges in a monacorde and tune which
was the matrimony to be fineshed betwene the kynge and the lady Elizabeth
daughter to kyng Edward, which lyke a good prynce accordyng
to his othe and promes, he dyd both solempnise and cōsummate in brief
tyme after, that is to saye on the .xviii. daye of Ianuary. By reason of
whiche mariage peace was thought to discende oute of heauē into England,
consideryng that the lynes of Lancastre &amp; Yorke, beyng both noble
famylies equiualēt in ryches, fame and honoure, were now brought
into one knott and connexed together, of whose twoo bodyes one heyre
might succede, which after their tyme should peaceable rule and enioye
the whole monarchy and realme of England.
            These thynges thus passed, albeyt that apparauntly all thynges semed
to be reduced to a good poynte and set in a sure steye: Kyng Henry
beyng made wyse and expert wyth troubles and myschiefes before past,
remembred that yt was wisdome to feare &amp; prouide for the crafty wyles
and lurkyng trappes of his secret enemyes, remembryng all mē for the
moost parte embrued &amp; exercysed in plantyng of dyuision and sowynge
dissencion, can not lightely leaue their pestiferous appetite &amp; sedicious
occupacion. Wherfore, for the sauegarde and preseruacion of his awne
body, he cōstituted &amp; ordeyned a certayn nombre aswell of good archers
as of diuerse other persons being hardy, stronge and of agilitie to geue
dailye attendaunce on his person, whom he named Yomen of his garde,The first Yomen of the garde.
which president men thought that he learned of the Frenche kyng when
he was in Fraūce: For men remembre not any kyng of England before
that tyme whiche vsed such a furnyture of daily souldyours. Yet forasmuche
as to auoyde and eschewe all doubtfull daungers and perelles
vnloked for, lytle auayleth ourward warre, except there be a sure staye,
and a stedfast backstande at home, aswel for the sauegarde &amp; securite, as
for the good gouernaūce of such as be left behynde: He therfore sommoned
agayne hys great courte of parliament, wherto he would that there
should be elected the most prudent &amp; grauous persons of euery countie,
cytie, porte and borogh, and in especiall suche as he in all his daungers,
calamities, miseries and tumulteous affaires, vsed, trusted and fauoured,
as parttakers, councelers, and compaignious both of his woo and

aduersitie, and also of his triumphe &amp; gloryous victory, whose myndes
and studyes he perfightly knewe to be fixed and set in the poletique regunent
and prudent gouernaūce of the publique wealthe of his realme
and domynion. Not 
                  •
               orgettynge, but hauyng in freshe memory that he
for that cause principally was so sore desyred, and instantly called of the
Englishe nacion hys naturall countreymen: Estemynge yt as a chiefe
and principall parte of hys ductie to se his realme bothe adourned and
decored with good and profitable lawes and statutes, and also to florishe
in verteous operacions and good and cyuile maners, which should
be an

               ccasyon to cause all men to hope that all thynge would continually
amend, from euyll to good, from good to bettre, and from bettre to
the best. This sure foundacion kyng Henry layde at the begynnyng of
his reigne, entendyng theron contynually to buylde.
            In this same yere a newe kynde of sicknes came sodenly through the
whole region euē after the first entryng of the kyng into this Isle, which
was so sore, so peynfull &amp; sharp that the lyke was neuer harde of, to any
mānes remembraūce before that tyme:The Sweatyng syc

sweate i
                  •
               uaded their bodyes &amp; vexed their bloud with a most ardēt heat,
infested the stomack &amp; the head greuously: by the tormentyng and vexacion
of which sicknes, men were so sore handled &amp; so peynfully pangued
that yf they were layed in their bed, beyng not hable to suffre the importunate
heate, they cast away the shetes &amp; all the clothes liyng on the bed.
If they were in their apparell and vestures, they would put of all their
garmētes euen to their shirtes. Other were so drye that they dranke the
colde water to quenche their importune heate &amp; insaciable thirst. Other
that coulde or at the least woulde abyde the heate &amp; styntche (for in dede
the sweate had a great and a strong sauoure) caused clothes to be layed
vpon theim asmuche as they coulde beare, to dryue oute the sweate yf it
might be. All in maner assone as the sweate toke them, or within a short
space after, yelded vp their ghost. So that of all them that sickened ther
was not one emongest an hundreth that escaped: In somuche, that besyde
the great nombre whiche deceased within the cytie of London, twoo
Mayres successiuely dyed of thesame desease within .viij. daies and .vj.

               es (for so long did the strength of this plague hold them) he should
be then clerely delyuered of hys desease: Yet not so cleane ryd of yt, but
that he might shortly relaps and fall agayn into thesame euyll pyt, yea
agayne &amp; twyse agayne as many one in dede dyd, whiche after the thyrd
tyme dyed of thesame. At the length by study of Phisicians &amp; experience
of the people, dryuen therunto by dreadfull necessytie, there was a remedy
inuented: For they that suruyued, consyderyng thexstremytie of the
peyne in them that deseased, deuised by thynges mere cōtrariaunt, to resyst
and withstande the furious rage of that burnynge furnesse, by luke
warme drynke temperate heate, &amp; measurable clothes. For such persons
as relapsed agayn into the flame after the fyrst delyueraunce, obserued

diligently &amp; marked suche thynges as dyd theim case and cōfort at their
fyrst vexacion, &amp; vsyng thesame for a remedy &amp; medicine of their peyne,
addyng euer somewhat therto that was sanatyue &amp; wholsome. So that
yf any person euer after fell sicke agayn, he obseruyng the regymēt that
emongest the people was deuysed could shortly helpe him selfe, &amp; easely
tempre and auoyde the strength and malyce of the sweate. So that after
the great losse of many men, they learned a present &amp; a spedy remedy for
thesame desease and malady, thewhiche is thys: If a man on the daye
tyme were plagued with the sweate, then he shoulde streyght lye downe
with all his clothes and garmētes and lye styll the whole .xxiiii. houres.
If in the nyght he were taken, then he should not ryse out of his bed for
the space of .xxiiii. houres, &amp; so caste the clothes that he myght in no wyse
prouoke the sweate, but so lye temperately that he water myght distille

                  •
               ute softly of the awne accorde, &amp; to absteyne from all meate yf he might
so longe susteyne and suffre hungre and to take no more drynke neither
hote nor colde, then wyll moderately quentche and delaye hys thrustye
appetyde. And in this his amendynge, one poynte diligently aboue all
other is to be obserued and attended, that he neuer put his hand or foote
out of y• bed to refreshe or coole him selfe, thewhich to do is no lesse peine
then short death. So you may pleynly see what 
                  •
               emedy was by the daily
experience excogitated and inuēted for thys straunge and vnknowen
desease, thewhich at that tyme vexed and greued only the realme of England
in euery toune &amp; village as yt dyd dyuerse tymes after. But .lv.
yere after, it sayled into Flaunders and after into Germany, wher it destroyed
people innumerable for lack of knowledge of the Englishe experience.
This cōtagious &amp; euell plague chaunced in the first yere of kyng
Henryes reigne as a token and a playne signe (if to the vaine iudgem
                  •
               t
of the people whiche cōmonly cōmen more fantastically then wisely, any
faith or credite is to be had, geuē or attributed) that kyng Henry should
haue a harde and sore begynnyng, but more truly yf vayne snpersticion
can set furth any truthe, it pretended &amp; signifyed that kyng Henry to the
extreme poynte and ende of his naturall life should neuer haue his spirite
and mynde quyet, consideryng that nowe in the very begynnyng of
his newe obteyned reigne, he was (as yo
                  •
                shall shortly heare) with sedicion
and cōmocion of his people, troubled, vexed and vnquyeted, and it
was in maner a manifest profe that herafter he should lyue in small rest
and great mystrust of suche rebelious and sedicious cōspiracies. These
were the phantasticall iudgementes of the vnlettred persons whiche I
ouerpasse, and retourne to my purpose.
            When all thinges by y• kyng were appeased at London &amp; that he had
set &amp; appoynted all his affaires in good ordre and sure state, as he with
him self cōiectured▪ he thought it best to make a peregrinaciō &amp; take his
progresse into y• other quarters of his realme, y• he might wede, extirpate
and purdge the myndes of mē spotted &amp; cōtaminate with the cōtagious
smoke of dissencion, &amp; preuy faccions, &amp; especially the countie of Yorke

which were preuy faut
                  •
               ures and cōforters of the cōtrary parte, and not
without a cause. For kyng Richarde more loued, more estemed &amp; regarded
the northern mē then any subiectes within hys whole realme, which
thyng to kyng Henry was not vnknowē. Wherfore he the more studied
to kepe thē in dew obeisaunce &amp; faithfull obsequy, whō he knew of long
custome to haue borne their hartes &amp; fauourable myndes to his aduersaries:
therfore in y• pryme tyme of the yere he toke his iorney towardes
Yorke, &amp; because the feast of Ester approched, he diuerted to the cytie of
Lyncoln, where he taryed duryng the solēpnite of that high feast: &amp; makyng
there his abode, he was certified y• the lord Louel &amp; Homfrey stafforde
were departed out of sanctuary in Colchestre: but to what place or
whether, no man as yet could tell. For which cause the kyng lytle regardyng
the tale went forthe his appointed iorney to Yorke. And assone as
he was there receaued &amp; settled, it was bruted, and openly shewed to the
kyng him selfe that Fraunces lorde Louell was at hand with a stronge
and mightye powre of menne, and woulde with all diligence inuade the
cytie: also that the forenamed Homfrey Stafforde &amp; Thomas hys brother
were
                  •
                in worcettre shyre and there had raysed a great bande of rude
and rusticall people, &amp; had cast lottes what parte should assaute the gates,
what mēne should scale the walles of the cytie of Worcestre, &amp; who
should kepe the passages for lettyng of reskewes and aiders.
            At the first heryng of this, the kyng estemed it for vaine &amp; vncertain,
and therfore was with it but litle moued: but after that he was certified
by the letters of credēce sent frō his frendes, that all was true that was
by the cōmen voice spoken and published, he was afflicted with no smal
feare. And surely not without a cause, for he wisely cōsidred that he had
neither a competēt army ready prepared, nor harneys nor weapons for
them that were present. And also he was now in such a doubtfull place,
where he nether might nor could cōueniently gather an hoost together,
cōsideryng that in thesame cytie, the memory of kyng Richard his mortall
enemy was yet recent and lyuely &amp; not all forgottē of hys frendes,
but because the matter requyred dilygent celery
                  •
               ie, least that by longe
tariyng the powre of his aduersaries by daily aides might be encreased
and multiplied, he cōmaunded the duke of Bedforde with .iii. thousand
men not strongely armed to do a great entrepryce (for their brest plates
for the moost parte were made of tanned lether) to encountre &amp; set vpon
them with all hast and diligence, and made him preuy what he him selfe
entended to doo. After this, the kyng congregated together an hoost in
euery place where he might retayne theim. The duke settyng forwarde
after the fassion of an eger &amp; fierce captaine came nigh to the tentes and
campe of his enemyes where he consulted and cōmunycated his mynde
with certayne capitaynes &amp; sage souldiours of his compaigny, by what
waye he might treyne &amp; allure them to peace, without battaill or bloodsheddyng.
After whiche deliberacion and aduysement had, yt was decreed
that the Herauldes should proclayme openly, that all such should

haue grace and pardon that would cast downe their weapons and harneys,
and as faithfull subiectes submyt them selfes to their naturall scuereigne
lord. Thewhich proclamacion auayled &amp; muche proffited: For
the lord Louel, either for some feare or diffidence that he had in his people
and souldyours, or fearyng hym selfe on his awne behalfe, fled preuily
in a night from his compaignye and left them without a head▪ as a
flocke of shepe without a shepard, whiche departure when it was to his
armye disclosed, they put of their armure and came directly to the duke,
euery man humbly submittyng hym selfe and desiryng pardon for their
offences, wholy trustynge in the kynges mercye &amp; fauourable goodnes.
So by this pollitique wisdome &amp; ingenious meanes of the good duke,
this great rage and fierce route of sturdy and valyaūt traytours which
was prepared against the kyng, and were lyke to haue been the 
                  ••
               aughter
of many a man, were pacefyed &amp; repressed and brought to good conformytie
and obedient subieccion. And the lorde Louell cheueteyne and
chiefe leader of this tumult &amp; rebellion, fearyng more perell and daungier,
then desiryng renoune or fame of cheualry, neuer tariyng ye doubtfull
chaunce of battaile, fled in all post haste into Lancashire, and there
for a certayne space loytred and lurked with sir Thomas Broughton
knyght, whiche in those quarters bare great swynge, and was there in
great aucthoritie. Homfrey Stafford also hearyng of this myschaunce
happened to the lord Louell, in a great dolor and agony, and for feare,
in lyke maner fled and tooke sanctuary in a village called Culnaham,
two myles from Abyndon. But because the sanctuary was not a sufficient
defence (as it was proued before the iustices of the kynges benche)
for traytoures, he was taken by force from that place, &amp; brought to the
towre, and from thence conueyghed to Tyborne and there put to execucion:
but his younger brother Thomas, that was with him, was perdoned
&amp; remitted because he was thought not to haue done yt of his awne
wyll and malicious mynde, but thorowe the euell counsaill and mischeueous
persuasyon of his Eldre brother.
            After that the kyng had thus by pollecy of his coūsaill appeased and
repressed this tumulteous sedicion whiche greately vexed &amp; vnquyeted
his spirites, and had reduced to reason and cōformitie the rude and bablyng
people of the north parties, and in especiall thinhabitaūtes of the
countye of Yorke, he returned to London, &amp; shortly after that to Wynchestre,
where quene Elizabeth his wife was deliuered of a fayre prince
named Arthur at his baptyme.The birth of prince Arthur Of whiche name Englishemen nomore
reioysed then outwarde nacions &amp; foreyne prynces trymbled and quaked,
so muche was that name to all nacions terrible &amp; formidable: And
from Wynchestre he returned back agayn to London.
            In this meane tyme, of a smal matter and thesame altogether beyng
false &amp; feyned, ther was an open pathe &amp; a apparaūt high weye made for
a greater inconueniency to ensue. The which matter for the subtyl iuggelyng
&amp; craftie cōueighaunce of thesame, no lesse deceytfull then ligier

de mayne in the hand of a iuggeler, was to be estemed emōgest all wyse
men at the first a very bold &amp; ouer presumpteons an acte to be attēped:
but ye tyme well weyed &amp; considred it was not so mōstreous that it were
worthy great wonderyng &amp; admiracion, cōsyderyng that many persons
of late, either borne in the wōbe of cōtinuall dissencion, or norished with
the mylke, or suckyng the pappes of ciuile sediciō, could not lyue well in
rest, &amp; lesse forbeare their vsual custome of mouing strife &amp; daily debate.
But they somtime sittyng at home cōpassyng &amp; ymaginyng hurte &amp; dā
               mage
toward suche as they in their hartes disdeyned, somtyme remembryng
that by the libertie &amp; priuilege of warre,A Prouerbe. all is fishe that cōmeth to
the net, euer delitynge in spoylyng, robbyng &amp; reuynge, vehemētly thristyng
for the distruccion &amp; losse of such as thei would be reuēged of, willyng
to lyue without lawe in tyme of peace &amp; warre, wisshyng the world
neuer to be at a bettre staye. And as persons only dedicate &amp; geuē to mischiefe
&amp; scelerous inuenciōs, either for hatred, euell wyl or malice of thē
that they fauoured not, or for some emolumēt, proffite and cōmoditie of
such y• they thought to set vp &amp; auaunce, were by fraude, couyn &amp; crafty
collusiō prone &amp; ready to disquyet euery day the kyng &amp; his whole realme,
thinking y• heauē had to much peace &amp; quietnes, &amp; hel to litle trouble
and vexacion. And there was furtherers &amp; setters on, none lackyng, in so
much that .xx. persons woulde soner pricke them forward with a sharpe
spurre, then one plucke thē back wt a dull snaffle. Emong the which mō
               stres
&amp; lymbes of the deuell, there was one sir Richard Symond priest,
a māne of a base &amp; obscure familie, which frō his byrth delited in fraude
and craftie conueighyng, &amp; yet was he well learned, but not so well learned
as wilye, nor so wilye as vngracious. Which sir Richard Symond
had elected a scoler called Lambert Symenell, one of a gentle nature
and pregnaūt wyt to be the organe &amp; conduyte by whom he would conuey
his false feigned enterprice and attempt. The deuel chiefe master of
mischiefe put in the wicked mynde and venemouse brayne of this moost
pernicious disloyall and trayterous person, to cōmence, feigne &amp; deuyse
how he might make his childe and scolar Lambert to be the right inheritour
to the croune of England, &amp; so therof to make him kyng &amp; to promote
him self to the chiefe Archebishopricke or some high potestate w
                  •
               in
the realme. The chiefe foundacion of his occasion was (by thewhich he
was the more bolde) that the fame went &amp; many menne surely supposed
kyng Edwardes chyldrē not to be dead, but to be fled secretly into some
straunge place &amp; there to be liuyng, and that Edward erle of Warwike
sonne &amp; heire to y• duke of Clarēce, either was or should be put to death
shortly. These rumoures although they were friuelous &amp; vayne &amp; with
out all likelyhode of verite or truthe, animated &amp; encouraged this priest
much, to thinke and iudge the tyme to be come that this Lambert might
assume &amp; take vpon hym the person &amp; name of one of kyng Edward the
fourthes chyldren, and to clayme and make title both to the realme and
kyngdome, hauyng sure knowledge that neither frendship should want

nor aide should lacke: and consideryng that cancard hatred rooted and
founded vpō facinorous faccions &amp; sedicious deuysions be so perdurable
and in maner euerlastyng that they can neuer be clerely extirpate or
digged out of their rottē hartes, but that they wylle with hand &amp; foote,
toothe and nayle further if they can their pretensed entreprice. And this
poore priest brought into this foolishe paradice through his awne fantasticall
ymaginacion, informed &amp; taught the chyld diligētly at Oxenforde
where he went to scoole, both instructyng him with princely behaueour,
ciuyle manner &amp; fruitefull litterature, declaryng to him of what
high parentage and of what noble progeny he was lyncally descended,
thus persuadyng and teachyng hym his lesson clerckly and craftely, for
his purpose, that y• people hearyng the chyld thus rehersyng his stocke
so sagely, might the rather geue credite to his deceytfull pretēce &amp; false
coloured inuencion: Sone after the rumour was blowen abroade that
Edward y• younge erle of Warwike was brokē out of pryson. And whē
sir Symōd heard of this, he now intēdyng therby to bryng his muēted
purpose to a cōclusion, chaūged y• childes name of baptime &amp; called him
Edward after y• name of the yoūg Erle of Warwike, ye which were both
of one yeres &amp; of one stature, &amp; then he wt his pupille sailed into Irelād,
there openyng his mynd, &amp; declaryng his mattre to certain of the Irishe
nobilitie, whō he knew by trewe fame &amp; reporte to beare but litle fauour
to kyng Henry nor his partakers, &amp; hauyng othe and promes of aide to
him sworne &amp; made, he shewed them that he had saued and preserued the
duke of Clarēce sonne frō death, &amp; had for very good will brought hym
into that countrey &amp; region where he knew that both kyng Edward and
all his stock were fauoured &amp; loued aboue all other. This matter was
beleued straight of the nobilitie which so shewed &amp; publyshed this feigned
fable and ymagined iuggelynge from one to another tyll at the last
yt was accōpted to be as true as the Gospell without any cōtrouersye,
ambigiutie or question. In so much that the lord Thomas Gerardyne
chauncelour of all y• country defrauded by his illusion vndre the colour
of plaine truthe receaued hym into his castell and with honoure &amp; reuerence
him entreteyned as one that descended frō the high progeny of the
sangue royall, and begāne much to aide &amp; helpe him. First callyng together
all his frendes &amp; louers &amp; suche other as were of bande or affinitie,
declaring first to them the cōmyng of this childe, &amp; after affirmyng that
the croune and sceptre of the realme of right apperteyned to this yoūge
prynce as sole heyre male lefte of the ligne of Richarde duke of Yorke:
Exhortyng and desiryng theim bothe for the childes sake and his awn,
as he was true inheritoure to the croune, to helpe and assyst hym to obteine
the garland and possession of thesame by his graundfather to him
lyneally descended. And so after communicatyng thesame matter with
other of the nobilitie, euery man promysed accordynge to hys powre,
aide of monye, menne and municyons. By thys meanes the same was
shortely bruted throughout all Irelande, and euery man was willynge

to take his parte and submyt them selfes to him, callyng him of al handes
kynge. So that newe they of this secte thus compassed and sortyd,
thought to haue in other places their compaignyons and furtherers of
their malicious purpose &amp; most pestiferous faccion, and straight foorth
they sent to England certayne preuy messengers to desire theim, whome
they knewe to haue been true and faythfull trendes to Kyng Richarde,
now to cōtinue in their accustomed loue and faithfull frendship toward
his nephewe and to helpe the childe with treasure &amp; substaunce as farre
as they conueniently might. And that his powre might be the stronger
to ouercome his enemyes &amp; to obteyne his pretensed purpose, he and his
confederates sent messengers into Flaunders to the lady Margaret syster
to kyng Edward and late wyfe to Charles the duke of Bourgoyne
to further his purpose with al her powre and helpe. This duke Charles
hauyng no chyldren by this lady Margaret, left one sole daughter named
Mary behynd him, begottē of his first wyfes daughter to the duke
of Burbone, whiche was maried to Maximilian lonne to Frederick the
Emperour, on whiche wife he had engendred two children, the one Philip,
and the other Margaret. The whiche two chyldren after the deathe
of the lady Mary their mother, this lady Margaret late wyfe to duke
Charles so entierely beloued, so tenderly brought vp, and so motherly
norished beside the dailye payne that she toke in ordrynge their affaires
and busynes for the mayntenaunce of their honoure and preferment of
their proffite that she both for her motherly loue toward the yoūge children,
&amp; also for the good administracion of iustice intheir countries, was
highly reputed and estemed &amp; bare great aucthoritie &amp; swynge through
all Flaunders and the lowe countries therto adi
                  •
               cēt. This lady Margaret,
although she knewe the familye and stocke of the house of Yorke
to be in maner distroyed &amp; vtterly defaced by her brother kyng Richard,
yet not beyng saciate nor content with the longe hatred &amp; continual malice
of her parentes which subucrted and ouerthrew almost the progeny
and lignage of kyng Henry the .vi. and the house of Lancaster, nor yet
remembryng the newe affinitie &amp; stronge alliaunce that was lately concluded,
by thewhiche the heyres of bothe the houses and progenies were
vnited &amp; comoyned together in lawful matrimony, lyke one forgettyng
both God &amp; charite, inflamed with malice &amp; diabolicall instinctiō, inuented
&amp; practised all mischiefes, displeasures and dāmages that she could
deuyse against the kyng of England. And farther in her fury and frantyke
moode (accordyng to the saiyng of the wise man there is no malice
equiualent nor aboue the malice of a womā) she wrought all the wayes
possible how to sucke his bloud and cōpasse his destruccion as the principal
head of her aduerse parte &amp; contrary faccion, as though he should
be a dewe sacrifice or an host immolated for the mutuall murder &amp; 
                  ••
               amefull
homicide cōmitted and perpetrated by her brother and progeny.
So vehe
                  •
                ēt so full of poyson and so stronge is the powre of ciuyle dissension
and preuye harted, that sometyme it wyll auert and withdrawe

the wisest and moost sapient men from goodnesse, honestie &amp; their bounden
allegeaunce. Therfore this lady knowyng of this tumulteous secte
and conspiracy, prepared and sodenly deuysed against kyng Henry (although
she knewe it to be but a feigned &amp; peinted mattre &amp; not woorth
two strawes) yet (hauyng suche an occasion to worke her malice vpon)
she promised gladly to the messengers not only to mainteyne, aide, further
and succoure their purposed entent with money and substaūce, but
with all the laboure &amp; peyne that she might, to encourage, stomacke and
entyce many other to be aiders, assisters &amp; partakers to thesame conspiracy,
and shortely to ioyne with the cheueteines of thesaide enterprice.
            Whē kyng Henry was certefied of these doynges by messengers sent
into England, no meruell although he was none other wise then he had
occasion, sore vexed &amp; moued, cōsideryng that by the disc
                  •
               ate and fraude
of suche a dongehyll knaue and vyle borne villeyne, so great a sedicion
should be excited and sturred agaynst him: Neuertheles, he lyke a circū
               spect,
ingenious and prudent prynce, well consideryng and pollitiquely
forseynge, ymagined that if this entreprice came to passe, that the finall
ende would be the bluddy darte of mortall warrre, &amp; yf they should ioyne
and combate in open battaile, in the which for the moost parte, the large
campe of all mischiefe is commonly opened and shewed, many innocent
menne on both partes should perishe and come to ruyne and confusyon
without desert or offence. For which reason, before all thynges he determyned
to attempt and proue yf that he might without anye battayle or
stroke stryken (thende whereof is euer ambiguous and doubtful) pacefye
and reduce these rebels to rule, reason, &amp; dewe subieccion, before that
this euell newly planted wede should straye and wander ouer the good
herbes of his whole realme. Therfore he called his whole coūsaill together
at the Chartrehouse besyde his royall manner called Richemonde,
and there consulted how to pacefye this sodeyne rage secretly begonne,
withoute any more disturbaunce or open trouble: whiche mocion of all
menne was thought mete, necessary &amp; proffitable to be as
                  •
               ayed and prosecuted
with celerite and effecte. And that before any other thynge were

should sodeynly moue a newe insurreccion against him, &amp; vnquyet hym
in some place where he had left least resistaūce. For although they were
thought to haue been conferates and Iurates of this newe conspiracy,

yet, because there was no sure profe nor apparaunt argument therof, yt
was supposed to be moost proffitable for that tyme present, to extende

they shoulde bee founde to drawe backe, and negligent in doynge
their due duetye and allegiaunce, that then by this pollitique prouision
they should be rewarded with punyshmēt accordyngly as they had deserued,
and accordyng to the cōmen saiynge, suche breade as they bake,
suche muste they eate: Whereupon the kynge gaue a generall pardon
throughoute all Englande (without exception of any offence) yea euen
to them that had commytted high treason agaynst hys maiestie and royall
person. Furthermore, after longe consultacion had and all thynges
maturely decyded, it was thought by the whole senate for the tyme then
present moost necessarye and conuenyent to auoyde that erronyous rumoure,
rumblynge and blastynge abroade, that the sonne of the duke
of Clarence was in Englande, and that he personally shoulde be shewed
abroade in the cytie and other publique places whereby the vntrue
opinyon falsy affyrmynge that he was in Irelande mighte be emongest
the cōmynaltye repressed, put downe, and accompted as a comment and
vayne ymagyned fable.
            In this solempne counsaill dyucrse and many thynges of the realme
were there debated and concluded: and emongest other, yt was determyned
that the lady Elizabeth wyfe to kyng Edwarde the .iiii. shoulde
loase and forfeyte all her Landes and possessyons, because she had voluntarely
submytted her selfe and her daughters wholy to the handes
of kyng Richarde, contrarye to the promes made to the lordes and nobles

               d, which at her desyre and request lefte all that they
had in England and fled to kyng Henry into Briteyne, and there receaued
a corporall othe of him to mary her eldest daughter, which offre she
abode not by, but made yt frustrate and voyde, through whose double
doynges yt had lyke to haue succeded, that neyther the mariage coulde
take place▪ nor yet the noble men whiche at her request toke kyng Henryes
parte, might not returne agayne without ieopardie of lyfe, but lyue
styll in perpetuall banyshement and myserable exyle. This was a
greueous offence and a heynous cryme: howbeyt the sequele thereof
well dygested, yt was thought by some man that she deserued not by
equytie of iustyce so great a losse and so great a punyshement: For
surely she dyd not so great hurte or hynderaunce to kynge Henry and
hys confederates by her reconciliacion to kynge Richard, but tenne tymes
more she proffyted theim and auaunced theyr cause. For her submyssyon
made to hym, he heglectynge Goddes lawes,

whiche thynge he woulde not haue thought lykely to haue obteyned:
The quene and her daughters styll for feare of him contynuyng in sanctuary.
Whiche vnlawfull desyre (consyderynge for that entent he had

swoorde of vengeaunce agaynste hym, whereby hys fynall ruyne and
fatall falle shortely after ensued and succeded to hys myserable confusyon,
and to the exaltacyon of Kynge Henry and auauncemente of
hys whole company.
            Hereby a manne may perceaue that wycked and maligne persones
be not brought to ruyne by the hande of a temporall iudge, but by the
wyll of God led and thereto apoynted, as menne that make hast to approche
and to come to that ende that they haue deserued. By thys foly
and inconstancy of the quene, she incurred the hatred and displeasure
of many men, and for th

many yeres after she deseassed and is buryed with her husbande at
Wyndsore. Suche are all worldly chaunces, nowe in prosperyte and
aboundaunce, mutable and chaungeable and full of inconstancy: and
in aduersitye often chaunge from euell to good and so to bettre, to the
entent that they that be in wealthe and flowe in the aboundaunce of all
thynges, shall not thynke theim selfes in suretye to tary styll in that degree
and state: and that they that be in misery and calamytie shall not
despayre nor mystrust God, but lyue in hope, that a bettre daye of comforte
and gayne wyll once apere and come. And yet although fortune
ruleth many thynges at her wyll and pleasure, yet one woorke that this
quene hathe made cannot bee forgotten nor put in obliuion. At what
tyme that kyng Edward her husband reigned, she founded and erected
a notable College in the vniuersyte of Cambridge for the fyndynge of
Schloers desyrous of good litterature and learnynge, and endued yt
with sufficient possessions for the longe mayntenaunce of thesame, whiche
at this daye is called the quenes College, a name surely mete for
suche a place, wherin Scholers diligently studyeng in all doctryne and
sciences, proue excellent clerckes and come to great honoures.
            When all thynges in this counsaill were seriously concluded and
agreed to the kynges mynde, he returned to the cytie of London, geuynge

trustynge by her healpe to make a puyssaunt army of men, and to ioyne

the kyng had di
                  ••
               olued the Parliament, whiche then was holden: he fled
secretly into Flaunders to the lady Margarete, where Fraunces lorde
Louell landed certeyne dayes before. And there they beyng altogether,
euery man accordyng to his mynde reasoned, argued, and debated what
was best to doo. After longe cōmunycacion had, this fynall conclusyon
was agreed vpon, that the erle of Lyncolne and the lorde Louel should
go to Irelande, and there attende vpon her countrefeacte nephewe, and
to honor him as a kyng, and with the powre of the Irishemen to brynge
hym to England, and sendyng for all their frendes, should without delaye
geue battaile to kynge Henry: So that yf their doynges had good
and prosperous successe then the forsayde Lambert (mysnamed the Erle)
shoulde by the consent of the counsaill be deposed, and Edwarde the
true Erle of Warwyke to be delyuered oute of pryson, and after by the
aucthoritie and aide of his frendes of the nobilitie, should be published,
proclaymed, and anoynted kynge.
            But kyng Henry thynkyng his nobles to be well appeased with the
syght of Edward the very sonne of the duke of Clarence, nothynge mystrustyng
any man to be so folishe to muent, feigne▪ or countrefeate any
thynge more of hym, or any so mad or vndiscrete (especially of hys realme)
as to beleue that Lambert was very Edward, onely myndynge the
suppressyng of the Flagicius Irishemē, studied how to subdewe and represse
their bolde entreprice and sedicious coniuracion. And hearyng sodeynly
that he Erle of Lyncolne with other were fled &amp; gone to his aduersaries
beynge therwith sodeynly moued: thought euen with stronge
hand and marciall powre▪ to ouercome hys enemyes and euell wyllers,
whose maliciousnes he could by no counsaill nor pollecy eschewe nor auoyde:
And beyng thus determyned, he commaunded certeyne of his capitaynes
to prepare an hoste of men oute of euery parte of hys realme,

and them to bryng and conduyte into one place assygned, that when his
aduersaries should come forwarde, he might with his populous multitude
&amp; great powre sodeynly set on theim, &amp; so ouercome and vanquishe
them altogether. And mystrustyng that other would folowe the Erle of
Lyncoln into Flaunders, he caused the East partes, and all the borders
theraboutes to be diligently kept, that none other myght escape or geue them
succoure. And cōmynge to the toune of saynt Edmondes bury, he
was certifyed that the lord Thomas Marques of Dorcet was cōmyng
to excuse &amp; purge hym selfe before him, for certeyne thynges that he was
suspected to haue done lightely when he was in Fraunce. To whom the
kyng did send the Erle of Oxenford to intercept him ridyng on his iorney
and to conueigh him to the Towre of London, to trye his truth and
proue his paciēce. For if he were his frende as he was in dede, he should
not be miscontented to suffre so lytle a reproche &amp; rebuke for his princes
pleasure. If he were not his frend, there to tary in sauetye that he might
do no dāmage nor hurt to him. And from thence the kyng went furth to
Norwiche, &amp; tariyng there Christmas day, departed after to Walsyngham,
and cōmyng there into the churche of oure lady, prayed deuoutly
and made supplicaciōs to almighty God, that by his diuine powre and
through the intercession of our lady, he might eschew the snares &amp; preuy
workynges of his enemies, and preserue him selfe and his country from
the imminēt daungier, and to reduce agayne the streiynge shepe to their
right folde and true shepard, that be amysse: his orysons fyn
                  •
               shed, from
thence by Cambridge he returned shortly to London.
            In this meane tyme the Erle of Lyncolne and the lorde Louell, had gotten
by the aide of the lady Margaret, aboute twoo thousand Almanyes,
with Matyne Swarde a noble man in Germany, and in marciall
feactes verye expert, to be their cheuet
                  •
               yne, and so sailyng into Ireland.
And at the cytie of Dyuelyn, caused younge Lambert to be proclaymed
and named kyng of England, after the most solempne fassyon, as thoughe
he were there of the very heyre of bloud royall lyneally borne and
discended. And so with a great multitude of beggerly Irishemen, allmost
all naked and vnarmed sauynge skaynes and mantelles, of whom
the lord Thomas Gerardine was capiteyne and conductor, they sayled
into England with this newe founde kyng, and landed for a purpose at
the pyle of Fowdrey within lytle of Lancastre, trustynge there to be ayded
with mony by Sir Thomas Broughthon one of the chiefe compaignious
of this vnhappy conspiracy.
            The kyng not slepynge his matters, but mystrustyng and smellyng
the storme that folowed, before the enemyes arryued, he dispatched certeyne
horsemen throughout all the west partes of the realme, chiefely to
attende the cōmyng and arryuall of his enemyes, secondarely to wayte
for suche espialles as came out of Ireland, &amp; them to apprehend &amp; compell
to shew &amp; declare the secretes of their enemies. When he had gathered
all his hoste together, ouer thewhich, the duke of Bedforde &amp; the erle

of Oxenforde, were chiefe capiteynes, he went to Couentry, where he beynge,
his light horsemen accordyng to their duetie returned &amp; certefyed
him that ye erle of Lyncoln was landed at Lancastre with his new king.
Thewhich when the kyng vnderstode was so, he consulted with his nobilitie
and councellers to knowe if it were for the best to encountre with
theim oute of hand, or let them dragge awhile, for this mattre bothe requyred
counsaill and also celerite. After they had layed their heades together
and well debated the matter, it was determyned that they should
set vpō theim without any further delaye, least that their powre by longe
sufferaunce &amp; delaiyng of tyme myght be augmented &amp; greatly multiplyed.
And so after such aduysemēt takē, he remoued to Nottyngham,
and there by a lytle wood called Bowres he pytched his feelde: to whom
shortely after came the lorde George Talbot Erle of Shrewsbury, the
lorde Straunge, Sir Ihon Cheyny valeaunt capitaynes, with many
other noble and expert men of warre, For the kyng had cōmaunded and
geuen in charge before, that all persons of the counties adioynyng that
were hable &amp; of strengthe to cary weapon should be ready in an houres
warnynge, in case that any nede should requyre. Therfore pycked felowes
and hardy personages and suche as were lyke menne, were chosen
in all the ha
                  ••
               e, and of this sorte a great armye was coacted and gathered
together: So the kynges army was wondrefully encreased, &amp; from
tyme to tyme greatly augmented.
            In this space, the erle of Lyncoln beyng entred into Yorkeshire, passed
softely on his iourney without the spoylyng or hurtyng of any man,
trustyng therby to haue some company of people resorte vnto him: but
after that he perceaued fewe or none to folow him, and that it was to no
purpose to returne backe, consydryng his enemyes were all ready to set
vpon him, he determined firmely to trye the fortune of battaile, remembryng
that he chaunce of Mars dothe stand euer vpō .vi. or .vii. &amp; that
kyng Henry not .ii. yeres before with a small powre of men vanquished
kyng Richard &amp; all his mightie army. And herupon puttyng a sure confidence
vpō his compaigny, directed his waye from Yorke to Newarke
vpō Trent▪ to thentent that there he (as he trusted) augmētyng hys cō
               paigny
might set vpon the kyng, whō he knew to be but .ii. daies iorney
from him. Albeit, before he came there, kyng Henry was in his bosome
and knewe euery houre what the Erle did, came the night before that he
fought, to Newarke, and there approched nere hys enemyes soner then
they loked for him, and there tariyng a lytle went .iii. myles further and
pitched his feelde &amp; lodged there that night. The erle of Lyncolne certefyed
of his commyng, was nothynge afearde, but kepte styll on hys iorney▪
and at a lytle village called Stoke nygh to the kyng and his army
planted hys campe. The next daye folowynge, the kynge deuyded hys
whole nombre into three battailes, and after in good arraye approched
nigh to the toune of Stoke, where was an equall and playne place for
bothe parties to darreigne the battaile.
            
               
When the place was apoynted and ordeined to trye the vttermo

                     •
                  oke. the erle set furth his army, and geuyng a token to his
compaignye, set vpon his aduersaries with a manly courage, desirynge
his souldyours that daye to remembre his honoure, and their awne lyues.
And so both the armyes ioyned and fought earnestly and sharply,
in so muche that the Almanyes beynge tryed and expert menne in warres
and marciall feates, were in all thynges, aswell in stengthe as
pollecye egall and equyualent with the Englishemen: but as for Martyne
Swarde theyr chiefe capitayne and leader, not many of the Englyshemen,
bothe for valyaunt courage of a stoute stomack and strengthe
and agilyte of body was to be compared or resembled with hys
manhoode. Of the othersyde, the Iryshemen, although they foughte
hardely and stucke to yt valyauntly, yet because they were after the
manner of theyr countrey almoste naked, without harneys or armure,
they were stryken downe and slayne lyke dull and brute beastes whose
deathes and destruccyons was a great discouragynge and abash
                  •
               ment
to the residue of the company. Thus they fought for a space to sore and
so egrely of bothe partes, that no man coulde well iudge to whome the
victory was lyke to enclyne: But at length, the kynges 
                  •
               orward beynge
full of people and well fortefyed with wynges, whiche onely bothe beganne
and contynued the fyght, set vpon the aduersaryes with suche a
force and violence, that fyrst they oppressed and kylled suche capitaynes
one by one as resysted theyr myght and puyssaunce, and after that put
all the other to fearfull flyght, thewhiche were eyther apprehended as
captyues and prysoners in theyr flyght runnynge awaye, or elles slayne
and brought to confusyon in a small moment. But when this battaile
was fynished and fought oute to the extremytie, then yt well apered
what high prowes, what manly stomakes, what courageous hartes
and what valyaunt courage was in the kynges aduersaryes. For there
their chiefe capiteynes the Erle of Lyncolne and the lorde Louell, Syr
Thomas Broughton,Martyn Swarde 
                     •
                  layne. Martyn swarde &amp; the lord Gerardyne capiteyne
of the Irishemen were slayne and founde dead. Howbeyt, some affyrme
that the lorde Louell toke his horsse &amp; would haue fled ouer Trent, but
he was not hable to recouer the fartherside for the highnes of the banke
and so was drowned in the ryuer. There were kylled at that battaile
with their fyue capiteynes before reherced of that partye aboute foure
thousand: Of the kynges parte there were not halfe of them which fougthe
in the forward and gaue the onset slayne or hurt: Then was Lambert
the yonglynge which was falsely reported to be the dukes sonne of
Clarence, and his master sir Richard Symond prieste bothe taken, but
neither of them put to death, because that Lambert was but an innocēt
poore soule, a very chylde, and was not of age to do any suche entreprice
of his awne deuyce, and the other was a priest, which yet to thentēt he
might remēbre that the stone oftē tymes falleth on the head of hym that
casteth it into y• ayer, &amp; that many a man maketh a rod for his awn tayle

when he entendeth it for another, this preist for penaunce was cōmitted
to perpetual pryson &amp; miserable captiuitie. But this Lambert in cōclusion
was made the kynges faulkener, after that he had been a turne broche
and executed such vile officies in the kynges kytchyn &amp; suyllarye for
a space. And thus was all the high entrepryce that lady Margaret had
deuised &amp; set furthe at this tyme, turned to naught and brought to none
effect, &amp; to an euell cōclusion. Of which chaunce, when she was aduertysed
&amp; enformed in the countrye of Flaunders, she was very sorye at the
harte &amp; much lamented and deplored, that her ymagined purpose sorted
to suche an infortunate ende &amp; effect, incontinently deuisyng, practisyng
and ymagenyng some greate and more difficile enterpryce, by thewhich
she might vexe and perturbe yet once agayne the kyng of England and
his whole region: Whiche purpose, euen as she inuented yt, so she set yt
forwarde as shalbe shewed herafter plainly.
            After that kyng Henry had thus asswaged and appeased these matters
beynge of so great a moment and weight, with no great mocion, tumulte
or trouble, &amp; had not only escaped and defaced the apparant and
ymminēt perell with a small conflict▪ and no great daungerous brunt or
ieopardy▪ but also repressed &amp; suppeditate the cyuile dissencion and inte
               
                  •
               ior
stryfe, in maner as he woulde haue wyshed it, he might thynke hymselfe
at one tyme cleane ryd &amp; delyuered from two euelles together, both
from feare present &amp; also that was to come. For certeynly when he pondred
&amp; diligently consydered his aduersaries (whose puissaunce he both
in nombre and force, farre did surmount and precell) at the very poynte
so fiercely to ioyne and to byd him battaile, he much suspected &amp; no lesse
mistrusted that they had some preuy fautoures and secret coūcelers (the
which when tyme and place should requyre or expostulate) would with
their strength, aide, succoure and assyst them agaynst him and his puyssaunce.
But when he perceaued and sawe the hoost of his enemyes manifestly
vanquished and put to flight, he cōmaunded that no mā should
kyll or sleye the Erle of Lyncolne, but that he should be brought to hym
alyue, to thentent that he might shewe &amp; bewraye both the foūtayne and
originall begynnyng, and also the confederates, aiders and comforters
of his late practysed sedicious cōspiracy. But the fame is, that the souldyours
woulde not so do, fearynge least paraduēture the sauyng of his
only lyfe (as yt should haue been in dede) the lyfe of many other should
haue been lost, or at the least in ieopardye. This battaile was fought on
a saturdaye beyng the .xv

               . daye of Iuyn the yere of our lord thousand
foure hundreth .lxxxix. and towarde thende of the second yere of the reigne
of this kynge: In the whiche yere also Thomas Burchier Archebishopp
of Cauntourbury dyed, into whose rome Ihon Moorton late
bishop of Ely, a manne of egall learnyng, vertue and pollecye with hys
predecessours, whome Alexander of that name the .vi. bishop of Roome
created Cardinall, and the kynge preferred hym to thoffyce of the highe
Chauncelour of England: Now to returne to my purpose.
            
               
After this victory obteyned, &amp; after the kynge had gathered and collected
the prayes and spoyles of the Feelde together, and buryed theim
that there were slayne, he remoued to Lyncolne, and there reposed hymselfe
thre dayes, and c
                  •
               used euery daye one processyon to be celebrate, to
rendre humble thankes to almightye God, for his tryumphant victory
and ouerthrowe of his enemyes. Then dyd he execucion of suche rebelles
and traytoures as were taken in the felde, either at the battaile, or in
the chace. And shortely after he went into Yorkeshyre, and there costed
the country ouerthwart, searchynge by exploratours and preuy enquyries,
where hys aduersaryes gathered theyr army agaynst hym, entendyng
earnestly to wede oute, and purge hys land of all sedicyous seede,
and double harted fruyte yf yt were possyble: and suche as were founde
culpable in anye one poynte, were commytted to pryson, and other
mulcted by fyne or extinct by deathe.

of Northumberland, where he taryed the remnaunt of the

to kyng Iames the thyrde kyng of Scottes, Richard Foxe whiche not
longe before was made bishoppe of Excettre, and with him syr Richard
Edgecombe kynght comptroller of hys house.The summarye of their
commyssion was to conclude a truce for a tyme, or a longe league and
an amytie. For kyng Henry estemed it bothe honorable and proffytable
yf he myght haue pertyght peace and assured amytie with prynces adioynyng
and his next neighboures. And before all other with kyng Iames
of Scotlande, to thentent that his subiectes hauynge knowlege of
the amytie and despairyng vtterly to haue any refuge, comforte or succoure
of the Scottes, or other their neighboures circumuosyn &amp; adioynyng
cōtrary to their olde vsage, trust and expectacion, might the be

be cōtinued in the faithe, duetie &amp; loyaltie towardes their prynce and souereigne
lorde. The Ambassadours whē they were come into Scotland
to the kyng, were of him both gently entreteined &amp; after the most louyng
fassyō receaued &amp; fully harde. To whom at the fyrst he shewed his good
hart, his true mynde, tendrez
                     •
                  le, and fraternall affecciō, that the hym selfe
contynually bare, and yet dyd entende to shewe towardes kyng Henry,
although his subiectes were of a contrary mynde and opinyon, playnly
protestyng &amp; declaryng to them his vasselles to be bothe by nature and
wylfull disposicion, diuerse and cōtrary euer to the English nature and
English naciō: thinkyng surely that they for the most part, would neuer
cōsent &amp; longe agree with the Englishmen, accordyng to their olde vaffrous
varietie: wherfore least ye he should offend or ministre cause of occasiō
to them (as in dede all mē were not his frendes in Scotlād at that
tyme) he desired y• Ambassadours to cōsent wt truce &amp; abstinēce of warre

                  uen yeres, not onely in open audience, but on his honor he promys

                     ••
                  mely in secret communicacion (as secret as a concession made to a
priest) that he for his parte would kepe contynuall peace with the kyng
of England durynge their lyues, but apparauntly he promysed that or
these .vii. yeres should be passed and fully fyneshed that he would re
                     •
                  ue
agayne the truce for other .vii. yere, so that kynge Henry &amp; he should be
and lyue in peace, concorde, and moste assured amitye, duryng their naturall
lyues. And this dyd kyng Iames conclude with kyng Henry, because
that he knewe hym selfe, his actes, yea and hys name to be had in
suche despyte and hatred of the more parte of hys dysloyall people, that
nothynge (whatsoeuer he dyd) was estemed, regarded, well spoken of
or had in anye pryce: Suche was the malicious hartburnynge of the
Scottes agaynst their naturall lorde. The Ambassadours perceauyng
the hartye mynde and faithful beneuolence of this kyng towardes their
master kyng Henry, accepted and assented to his offre, and ratefyed thesame:
And returnyng home shewed the kyng all the matter in ordre as
yt was pro
                     •
                  oned, assented and concluded. With whiche tydynges, he
perccauynge the kyng of Scottes good mynde towardes hym, and apparauntly
perceauyng that as that tempestyous and stormy ceason requyred,
yt was not to hys small commoditie and proffyte, reioysed meruelously
that hys Ambassade came to so good an effecte: and shortely
after reculed backe agayne from Newcastell to Yorke, and so towarde
his cytie of London. And in the waye beynge at Leycestre, dyuerse Ambassadours
sent from Charles the Frenche kyng came to hys presence,
whiche declared and shewed to hym that theyr kyng Charles had recouered
manye Tounes, Cyties and garrysons whiche before that tyme
were possessed and holden of Maximilian kynge of Romanes and Archeduke
of Austryce, and that he nowe moued battaile agaynst Fraunces
duke of Briteyne, because he kepte, ayded and succoured in his territorie
and dominion diuerse noble prynces and high personages of the
realme of Fraunce, whiche were treytoures and rebelles agaynste hym,
his realme and seigniory, of thewhich the chiefe leader was Lewes duke
of Orlyaunce: And therfore he desyred hym for the olde frendshyp and
familiarite practysed betwene them▪ that he would either aide, assyst and
helpe hym, or elles stand neuter betwene both parties, neither helpynge
nor hurtyng any of bothe partes, lyke a cypher in algorisme that is ioyned
to no figure but onely occupieth a place.
               Kynge Henry well remembryng that although he had founde muche
frendshyp at the Frenche kynges hand in his necessitie and that by hym
partely and his he obteyned his kyngdome, yet forasmuche as he espyed
vpon what vnsure ground this querell was begonne against the Brytones,
with this message was not well contented nor yet pleased. For he
whiche sawe as farre in the Frenche kynges brest as hys Phis
                     •
                  cion dyd
in his vryne, knewe perfightly that he had neyther occasyon by any iust
tytle to inuade the duchy of Briteyne, nor yet any displeasure mynistred

to hym, by reason whereof he might iustly haue any shadowe to make a
quarell to the duke of Briteyne, but onely to delate, amplifye and propagate
farther his aucthoritie, domynion and possession. For the Frenche
kyng and his counsail knewe well that duke Fraunces was an impotent
man, lytargious, sore deseased and well stryken in age, and had
neuer anye heyre male to inheret and possede hys duchy, wherefore they
determyned by some meanes easely to compasse that the duchy of Bryteyne
should breuely come vndre their liure and subiecciō, and so withoute
grounde, without cause or reasonable demonstracion, vncompelled,
he intymated and made open warre against the duke and Brytanicall
nacion. Kyng Henry perceauynge that this newe attempted enterprice
nothyng sounded to his proffit or emolumēt, callyng to mynd and
consyderynge that yf the Duchy of Briteyne and the people of the same
whiche had been euer frendly &amp; louyng to Thenglishe nacion, and was
alwaies for their entrecourse to his realme both necessary and proffytable,
should come vndre the thraldome &amp; subieccion of the Frenche kyng
that dammage more then poffite were likely to ensue and folowe, determyned
with him selfe to aide and take parte with the duke, perceauyng
well that all his affaires was nowe in perell and set in a broyle and hasard.
The occasion that moued him therunto was, the kyndelyng of the
paternall loue and tendre affeccion whiche the duke euer shewed hym,
sith his fyrst arriuall and entryng into Briteyne, and his fidelite to him
alwaye apparauntly shewed durynge the tyme of hys there abydynge
and resydence. On the other parte, when he remembred the greate benefyte
that he had accepted and receaued at the Frenche kynges hand by
his bountyfull and pryncely liberalitie, thought it bothe necessary, honest
and consonant to reason to forgett the vngrate offence agaynst the
duke of Briteyne commytted and perpetrated, and to persuade and aduyse
the Frenche kyng to desyste from vexynge or inuadynge the duke
of Briteyne, least anye scruple or sparke of ingratitude might insurge
or kyndle betwene them two. This matter was so doubtfull and so full
of ambyguities that the kyng in longe consultacion lefte no questyon
nor doubte vnasked nor vndiscussed, and yet no aunswere nor no conclusyon
coulde satisfye or please hys doubtfull mynde and gentle harte,
lothe to offende anye of theim, of whome he had receaued eyther benefite
or frendship: But in conclusion, he fell to this ful determacion, that
y
                     •
                   battaile should nedes succede and folowe, then he of very duetie was
bounde and obliged not to denye nor to forsake the duke of Briteyne, to
whom he was so much beholdyng but to aide, assist &amp; comfort him with
all his powre, and openly to kepe from hym all wronges and iniuries,
and to defende &amp; resiste all his aduersaries &amp; enemyes. Yet in the meane
season, least he should of the other parte make his high frend his exstreme
enemy, his aunswere was to the Ambassadoures that he would take
trauayle &amp; study both to his great peyne &amp; cost, that betwene the Frenche
kyng their souereigne lorde &amp; the duke of Briteyne, both beyng hys

indifferent frendes, some gentle pacificacion or amicable accorde might
be concluded and accepted. And so assone as the kynges Ambassadours
were dimyssed, he sent on message Christopher Urswike to Charles the
Frenche kynge: First to gratulate in his behalfe the victory that he had
obteyned vpon Maximilian kyng of Romanes. Secondarely and after
to declare what tumulte and insu
                     •
                  reccion was here in England, and
howe by mere force and manhood he had vanquyshed and repressed the
rebelles and traytours, and eyther dystroyed or brought to subieccion,
the whole rablem̄t and nombre. Thyrdly, offryng him sefle as a meane
and intercessor of peace and amytie betwene the Frenche kynge Charles
and the duke of Briteyne: geuyng hym farther in charge that yf he
should perceaue the Frenche kyng to geue open eare to his request and
to enclyne to hys desyre, that then he shoulde withoute delaye resorte to
the duke of Briteyne and desyre him to be contented at his desyre to endeuer
him self to an honorable peace and concorde, rather then to warre
and dubyous dissencion, which peace with Goddes grace he lytle doubted,
the duke beynge wyllyng shortely to compasse and brynge to conclusion.
Whyle Christopher Urswicke was traueylynge in thys cōmissyon,
kyng Henry returned with great tryumphe to his cytie and chambre
of London, hauynge the victory and ouerhand of hys enemyes and
rebellious aduersari
                     •
                  s, whereof the cytezens were very glad &amp; reioysed
hartely, consideryng that such dāmages, such oppression, such perel and
losse as they thought to haue susteyned, was by the death of such disturbers
of peace &amp; trāquillitie, as the kyng had late ouercome, cleane takē
away, auoyded &amp; suppressed. Also the kyng hym self trustyng faithfully
that all the brādes of mischiefe kyndled before against him, was by this
victory vtterly extinguished &amp; brought to ashes, could not but be mery
&amp; reioyce. For which cause, he shewed him selfe both lowely &amp; courteous
towardes all, rewardyng &amp; promotyng most bountifully &amp; liberally all
such persones, which not only did hasarde their goodes, their possessiōs,
liuynges and substaunce, but also their lyues and bodyes in his defense
and quarell. And not longe after, he delyuered lord Thomas Marques
Dorset out of the Towre of London, acceptyng him to his high fauour
and olde familiaritie, because his truth and fidelitie had been tryed and
proued by sondry &amp; dyuerse argumētes and assaies, In which pastyme,
the kyng for the perfyght loue and syncere affeccion that he bar
                     •••
                   his
quene and wyfe lady Elizabeth, caused her to be crouned and enoynted
quene on saynt Fatherynes daye in Nouembre withall solempnytie to
suche a high esate &amp; degree apperteignyng. In the meane ceason Christopher
Urswike was come to the Frenche kyng liyng at Tholouse, &amp; of
him after the most louyng and frendely fassyon that coulde be, receaued
and entreteined. And affone as he had shewed and declared his message,
the Frenche kyng shewed hym selfe outwardly, althoughe inwardly he
otherwyse entended to be therewith contended and that very well pleased
that the kyng of Englande shoud be the meane of peace and Arbiter

indifferent betwene the duke and him. This answere made, the English
Ambassadour tooke his iorney streyght thēce as he was cōmaūded into
Briteyne, and shewed the duke vpon hys Masters behalfe all thynges
geuen him in charge and cōmissyon: But the duke (because him self had
bene longe sycke and therby his memory and wyt was decayed and appaired)
he appoynted to heare the message with other of hys councelers,
Lewes duke of Orleaūce whiche was fled thether out of Fraūce. When
this duke had hearde the Ambassadours declare their message, perceauynge
that it touched a peace whiche he thought sounded neither to hys
proffyt nor pleasure, wherfore he beyng somwhat tyckeled with the message
answered and sayed, that it was more me
                     •
                  e &amp; conuenient that kyng
Henry (consideryng and remembryng the great kyndenes &amp; humanitie
that he had receaued at the dukes hand) shoulde with all the powre and
strength he might, helpe the duke of Briteyne beyng by the Frenchemē
inuaded with yron▪ fyre and bloude, then to attempt or procure any fryuelous
or vayne composycion or cōcorde. Yea and although he had neither
receaued nor remembred any benefyte done to him by the duke, yet
should he consydre that the countrey of Briteyne was in maner a bullwerck
and a stronge wall for the Englishmen in defence of the Frenchemen,
the which yf yt should come into the handes of the Frenche nacion,
then were his continuall enemyes next to the gate of his realme, whiche
thyng he would not suffre if he remēbred the Prouerbe that sayth, when
thy neighboures house is a fyer, thy staffe stādeth nexte the dore. Thus
muche was the duke of Orlyaunce beyng of the French bloud, an enemy
to hys naturall countrey, because that he beynge next of the bloud
royal to the croune of Fraunce, was repulsed from the chiefe estate and
gouernaunce of the realme, and the kynges suster put in highest authoritie,
durynge the minorite of the kynge, he abandoned his awne natiue
countrey, and hauynge onely refuge in the duchy of Brytayne for hys
awne sauegarde, profyt and emolumēt, spake these woordes that he declared
and opened. For wel he knew, that kyng Henry was not therof
all ignorant, that it was neither profitable nor cōmodious 
                     •
                  or y• realme
of England, to haue the duchy of Briteyne possessed of the Gaul
                     •
                  s, considering
the sea costes of bothe the countreys, to lye directelye one agaynst
the other. Then returned this Christopher agayne into Fraūce,
and there taried certayne dayes, declaryng to kyng Charles what aunswer
was made to hym by the Briteynes, &amp; shortly after returned into
England agayn. Whyle these thinges were thus in doynge, the Frēche
kyng beseged with a great puissaunce the stronge citie of Nauntes in
Briteyne. And the more gredyer that he was of hys purpose, &amp; the more
hast he made for gayning hys praye, so moch the more did he exhorte ye
kyng of England with letters, writynges and blandymētes, by sondrie
and diuers messengers, for to treate and conclude a peace, vnytie &amp; concorde
betwixt the duke of Briteine and hym, fearing least when he had
almost wonne hys race, kynge Henry woulde put hym beside his sadle,

whome he did halfe suspect to be a backe frende of hys, and prone and
ready to take the Brytones parte.
               Wherfore he sent in Ambassade Bernarde a Scotte borne, caled y•
lord Daubeney, in all the hast to kyng Henry, to desire hym in any wise
to make some ende whatsoeuer it were, of this warre and controuersy.
And therupon the kyng beyng desirous of thesame, whiche had rather
al thinges might be ended by peace rather then by dynt of sweard, least
that he should be driuen to take parte with the Brytons agaynste the
French naciō, elected emong all other .iii. oratours. The first was Ihon
sainct Abbot of Abyndon, Ihon Lilye borne in Luke, the bishop of Romes
collector, doctor of lawe, and Rychard Edgecōbe knyght, both for
age and prudent fagacitie, fatherly, a wyse &amp; a graue personage, which
for renuyng of the olde amitie, were commaunded first to go to repaire
to the Frenche kyng, and after that to the duke of Briteyne, to whome
he gaue a longe commission with sufficient instruccions. But or euer
these Ambassadours proceded ouer their iorney, Ihon Lilie fel sicke on
the gowte, so that he was not able to traueyle in so long a iorney, and so
weightye a busynes, for whome was elected and choosen Christopher
Urswike▪ and so they .iii. sayled into Fraunce (as thei were cōmaunded)
and when they had communed a space with the Frenche kyng, concernyng
the forme of the peace &amp; concorde to be concluded, Rychard Egecombe,
and Christopher Urswike, departed streight to the duke of Briteine,
thinkinge ye and nothing doubting, but they there shoulde knyt
vp the knot, and finall conclusiō of their Ambassade, according to their
awne request and desyre, but all their hope was vayne, and turned to a
vanitie. For the duke, vpon great deliberacion, consiantly repudiated
and refused euery condicion by them offred or demaūded. Which thinges,
when they succeded not accordyng to their exspectacion, the Ambassadours
deposinge and relinquisshynge all hope and esperance of any
peace or concord to sorte to any good effect or purpose, reculed backe to
the Frenche kyng agayne, detrauded and spoyled of their entent and
purpose, and there to hym declared what was their aunswer and finall
resolucion, and yet makyng there abode in Fraunce, they intimated to
the kyng of England by their letters all their actes and exployt. But,
or their letters came to the kynges hādes, lyr Edward, lord Wooduile
vncle to the Quene, a valyaunt Capitayne, and a bolde Chāpion, either
abhorryng ease and ydlenes, or inflamed with ardent loue and affecciō
toward the duke of Britayne, desyred very earnestly of kynge Henry, yt
if it were hys will and pleasure, that he with a conuenient number of
good men of warre woulde transport hym selfe into Briteine, for ye aide
and defence of duke Fraunces, the kynges assured and proued frende.
And least it should sowe or kyndle any dissenciō or ingratitude betwene
the Frenche kyng and him, he sayde that he woulde steale priuely ouer,
and without any licence or pasporte, as though no man shoulde thinke
or doubte but he were fled, &amp; abandoned the realme without any fraude

or male engyn. But the kyng, which had a firme confidence, that peace
should be made by the polletique prouision and wyse muencion of hys
elected Ambassadours, woulde in nowise geue the brydle to hys hote,
hasty and wilde desire, but streyghtly prohibited hym to attempte anye
suche strategeme or enterprice, thinkynge that it 
                     ••
                  ode not with hys honor
to offende the Frenche kyng, to whome he woulde shewe as muche
amitie and humanitie as he might, for suche a matter that coulde neither
greatly profite the Brytonnes, nor yet cause hym to surceas
                     •
                  e of his
appoynted inuasion and pretensed enterprice. Yet this lord Wooduise
hauyng playne repulse and denyall of the kynge, coulde not thus rest,
determined to worke hys busynes secretly without any knowlege of y•
kyng, and went streyght into the Isle of wight, wherof he was made ruler
and capitayne, and there gathered together a c
                     •
                  ewe of tall &amp; hardye
personages, to the number of .iiii.C. and with prosperous wynde and
wether arryued in Briteyne, and ioyned hym selfe with the Brytons ag

                  t
the Frenche power and nacion. The rumor of thys doyng was
sone blowen into the courte of Fraūce, whiche made the Ambassadours
of Englande not smally abashed, which knowing perfightly ye Frenche
hartes to be prone and ready at all tymes to reuenge and do 
                     •
                  outrage

the lawe of armēs, and the treuth it selfe did defende and preserue them
from iniury. But whiles the oratoures were in this perplexite and fear

by a cau
                     •
                  ell of kyng Henry, there came other new messengers from him
to the French kyng to purdge hymself to his frend of the suspected ingratitude
certefiyng hym and declaring (by most euident tokens &amp; appar
                     ••
                  
argumentes) that the lord Wooduile without his knowlege or
consent, was sayled ouer into Britayne with so small a number of men,
which smal handful, neither it becōmed a prince to sende or set forward,
neither yet coulde do to the Brytaynes any great aide or succoure: To
the which message and excuse, albeit the Frenche kynge adhibited but
small credence, yet, he some what mitigate of his angre and furious agony,
dissimuled the matter (accordyng to the Frēch nature) with a flatteryng
countenaunce. So the Ambassadours renuynge a leagueand amitie
betwene their kyng and hym for .xii. monethes, returned into Englande
againe, and shewed the kyng al such thinges that they had either
heard or sene there. The kyng of England well perceyued by the report
of hys newly returned Oratoures, taht the Frenche kynge wrought all
hys factes by subtyll craft and cloked collusion, treatyng and mocionynge
peace and concorde, when he desyred nothing so much as discord
and warre, and that purpose he auaunced and set forwarde with sayle &amp;
ower, to the vttermost poynt of his habilite. Wherfore kyng Henry beyng
assured of all the French kynges actes and cogitaciōs, determined
now with all celerite to set forth out of hand al such thinges as here before

had cōcluded, cōcerning the warre of Britayne, as you haue heard.
Wherfore he called his high courte of Parliament, and there fyrst consulted
with the peres and cōmynaltie of hys realme, for the aidyng of y•
duke of Britayne. Then for the maintenaunce of y• warres, diuers summes
of money were graūted and geuen, beside certayne decrees &amp; actes
made for the vtilite of the common wealth. And assone as the Parliament
was ended he caused mustres to be had in certayne places of hys
realme, and souldiours mete for the warre to be put in a redynes. Yet
least peraduenture he might seme willingly to breake the amitie, which
was betwene the Frenche kynge and hym, he sente diuers notable Ambassadoures
into Fraunce, to certefye the Frenche kynge, that of late
he hadde kepte a solempne Parliamente, in the whiche it was condiscended
and agreed by the lordes temporall and spirituall, and knyghtes
of couuties, and magistrates of cities, and boroughes of his realme
not onely consideryng the relief, comforte, and aide that he had receyued
at the dukes hande, bothe for the sauegard of his lyfe, and for the recoueryng
of hys enheritaunce and kyngdome, but also remembryng that
Brytayne of auncient tyme was subiect &amp; vassal to the realme of Englande,
which countrey also hath been frendly, and aiders to the English
nacion when it was vexed, bothe with foreyne powers and domesticall
sedicion, to aide, comforte and assist the Brytishe nacion with all their
strength, might and habilite againste all their enemyes, frendly admonishyng
hym that he should either desist from hys warre in Brytayne
newly incepted, or els not be greued if he did agre (as reason woulde) to
the myndes, iudgement and determinacion of the princes and prelates
of hys realme, assuryng hym in the woorde of a kynge, that hys armye
should onely discende in the duchy of Britayne, not to inuade or make
warre in the Frenche kynges realme or territoryes, but onely to defend
the duchy of Britayne, and to profligate and expell all the intrudors &amp;
inuasours of the French nacion, whiche miustly occupied and muaded
the Brytannicall tytles and seignories. With these commaundemētes
the English Ambassadours departed, and declared to the Frenche king
all the mynde and will of their kyng and souereigne lord. Whiche message
he dissimuled as litle to regarde as the bytyng of a flee, as thoughe
the Englishmen in the battaile, whiche he knewe to be at hande, coulde
do no enterprice (as it happened in dede) either necessary to be feared, or
worthy to be remembred. The cause of hys so saiyng was thys, he knowynge
that hys army was puissaunt and stronge in Britayne, and that
the Britaynes had but a few Englishmen with the lorde Wooduile, of
whome he passed litle, and seyng that Englād had not yet sent any army
thether for the dukes succour, iudged surely that hys army woulde do
some gyeat exployte (as they did in dede) before either the duke shoulde
be purueyed or any aide ministred. And as he imagened so it folowed,
for the Frenchmen so sore oppressed the countrey of Britayne, and brent
and distroyed cities, and beseged the toune of Fōgeres, so that the duke

of Britayne was encouraged by the duke of Orliaunce, and other rebelles
of the Frenche kyng, manfully to fight and geue battaile to ye Frēch
army. And so the .xxv. daye of Iuly they set forward, &amp; came to a toune
whiche the Frenchmen had gotten, called sainct Aulbyne. The Frenchmen
were not ignoraunt of their commyng, but put theim selfes in a redynes.
Of whiche armye was Capitaynes, The lorde Lewes of Tre
                  
                     •
                  oyle,
vyscount of Thonars a Gascoyn, Adryan lorde of Mountfalcoysse.
On the Brytones parte were cheueteynes, Lewes duke of Orliaunce,
and the prynce of Orenge, whiche because they and other of the
Frenchemen were all on horsebacke, were mistrusted of the Brytones,
least they woulde at their moost nede flye.
               Wherfore they discended on fote, and the duke and the prynce put thē
                  selfes
in the battaile of the Almaynes: The Marshal of Rieux was appoynted
to the vauntgarde. The middle warde was delyuered to the
lord Dalebret, and the rereward to the lorde Chateaw Bryand, and to
make the Frenchemen beleue that they had a great number of Englishmen
(notwithstandynge there were but foure hundreth with the lorde
Wooduile) they appareled a thousand and seuen hundred Brytons in
cotes with red crosses after the English fasshion. When bothe the armyes
were approchyng to the other, the ordinaunce shot so terribly and
with suche a violence, that it sore dammaged and encombred bothe the
parties. When the shot was finished, bothe the vantgardes ioyned together
with suche a force that it was maruell to beholde. The Englishmen
shot so fast, that the Frēchmen in the forward, were fayne to recule
to the battaile where their horsemen were. The rereward of the French
men, seyng thys fyrst discōsiture began to flye, but the Capitaynes retired
their men together agayn, &amp; the horsemē set fiercely on ye Brytaines,
and slewe the moost parte of the fotemē. When the forward of the Brytones
perceaued that their horsemē nor the Almaines came not forward
they prouided for thē selfes &amp; fled, some here, and some there, where they
thought to haue refuge or succour. So that in conclusiō the Frenchmē
obteyned the victory, &amp; slew all such as ware red crosses, supposyng thē
all to be Englishmē. In thys cōflict were slayn almost all the Englishmen,
&amp; six. M. Brytones, Emōgest whome were sounde dead the lorde
Wooduile, &amp; the lord Iames Galeas borne in Napels. And of y• Brytones
there were slayne the lord of Leon, the lorde Mountsort, the lorde
Pontlabbe &amp; many noble &amp; notable persones of the British nacion. Of
the French naciō were slayne .xii.C. persones. The prynce of Orenge, &amp;
the duke of Orliaunce were taken prysoners, which duke (although he
were next heyre apparaūt to the croune of Fraūce) should haue lost hys
head, if lady Iane hys wyfe which was syster to Charles y• Frēch king,
had not obteined pardō &amp; remissiō of his trespasse &amp; offence. Howbeit he
was lōg after kept prysoner in the great Toure at Bourges in Berry.
This infortunate metyng chaūced to ye Britaynes on a mōday, beynge
the .xxvii. day of Iuly, in ye yere of our redēpciō .M.cccc.lxxxviii, &amp; in ye
iii. yere of kyng Henry the .vii.
               
                  
When these newes were brought into Englande, the kynge vigilantly
forseyng what was like to chaunce, thought it necessary to accelerate
the mattre before concluded, wherefore with all spede he sent Robert
Lord broke Syr Ihon Cheyny, syr Ihon Middelton, syr Raufe
Hilton, syr Rychard Corbet, syr Thomas Leighton, syr Richard Laton
and syr Edmond Cornewall, all lusty and courageous capitaynes with
viii. M. men well armed, and warlike furnished to ayde and assist the
Brytones agaynst the Frenchemen. These iolymen of warre had suche
prosperous wynde, that they arryued in Britayne euen as they woulde
wyshe or desyre. And after that they had recreated their spirites, and refreshed
them selfes a litle after their labour and iourney, they puttynge
thē selfes in good ordre of battaile, marshed forward toward their enemyes,
and not farre from them encamped them selfes. But when the
Frenchmen knew of their landyng, whome they knew by no small experience
(and especially so long as they were freshe and lusty) to be in maner
inuincible. And so at the beginnyng they were all blanke, &amp; for feare
kept them selfes craftely and polletikly within their campe. And after
that, they sent forth a smal company of lighte horsemen, the whiche to

                  gate the stoute stomackes and haute courages of the English
army▪ made in diuers places of the army, skyrmisshes, outeryes &amp;
alaromes. So for a certayne space they vsed thys kynde of daliyng wt
the Englishmen, but euer the losse turned to the Frenchmen, &amp; they bare
the woorse away, by reason of the archers y• so sore galled thē and theyr
horsses with arowes, that their braggyng incursions were sone left and
done. But beholde the mutacion of this worlde, whyle this warre was
thus set forward, Fraunces duke of Britayne departed out of this life,
so that the Englishmen were in a doubtfull labirinth, and a great ambiguyte.
For the chiefe rulers of the Britaynes, beyng some of them corrupted
with money, and some sturred with desire of deuision and cōtrouersie,
fell into deuision emonge them selfes, so that they semed not to
tenore the defence and proteccion of their naturall countre, but rather
mynded the distruccion and vttre confusion of thesame. Whiche deuision
the Englishmen perceauyng, and also consideryng that it was in ye
middest of wynter, in the whiche tyme it is not wholsome for men to lye
in the frosty and moyst feeldes, were compelled in maner by necessitie
within .v. monethes that they went forward, to returne backe agayn in
to Englande.
               After thys Charles the frenche kynge hauyng thus the vpper hand
of the Brytones, perceauyng that Maximilian kyng of Romanes laboured
to haue in mariage, Anne sole heire to Fraūces duke of Britain
for her younger suster was late dead, whiche he thoughte was neither
for hys profyte nor aduantage, concluded a peace with the Brytones.
By whiche treatie he had the lady deliuered into hys possession, &amp; after
her deliueraunce, he refusyng and repudiatynge the mariage of ye lady
Margaret, daughter to the forsayd kyng of Romanes, espoused y• lady

Anne duches of Brytayne, by whiche meanes the duchye of Britayne
was annexed to the croune of Fraunce, as here after shall appere when
it toke effect, whiche was not two yeres after.

                  NOwe to the mony layde out, as concernynge the sumpteousnes
of thys battaile. It was decreed by the .iii. estates
(as you haue heard) in Englande before that any souldioures
were sent into Britayne, that for the expence of that
warre, euery man should be taxed and assessed at the some
of hys substaunce, and should paie the tenth penny of hys
gooddes, for the maintenaunce of the warre in Britayn. Which money
the moost parte of them that dwelt about the Bishoprike of Durham &amp;
Yorkeshire, refused vtterly to paye, either thinking thē selfes ouercharged
with the greatnes of thesame, and therewith greued, or excited and
procured through the euell counsayll and sedicious pe
                     ••
                  asion of certayne
persones, whiche preuely conspired agaynst the kynge, to put him
to new trouble and busines. Therfore suche as were by the kynges cō
                  maundement
made Collectoures and gatherers of the summe taxed,
after that they coulde not get the money, accordynge to the extractes to
them by the commissioners deliuered, made their complaint preuely to
Henry the .iiii, Erle of Northumberland, chiefe ruler of the Northeparties.
And he immediatly vpō the knowlege therof, signefied the kynges
grace by hys letters, that the people greatly grudged and murmured,
makynge open Proclamacion that they haue ben charged of late yeres
with innumerable incommodities and oppressions, without any defaut
or desert, and that now there was a houge some requyred of them, which
neither they were hable to satesfie so great a demaunde, nor yet woulde
once consent to paye any one peny of the sayde summe requyred. The
kynge commaunded the erle in any wyse by distresse or otherwise accordyng
to hys discrecion, to exacte the money of the people, and by cōpulsion
to enforce suche to payment as whyned moost at it, least yt it might
appere that the decrees, actes and statutes, made and confirmed by him
and hys high courte of Parliament, shoulde by hys rude and rusticall
people be infringed, despised and vilepended. The rude rashe and vnaduised
people, hearynge this aunswer of the kynge, by and by, violently
set vpon the erle by the procurement of a symple felowe called Ihon of
Chambre, whome the erle intreated with fayre woordes to come to reason,
but they laiyng to hys charge that he was the chiefe author &amp; principall
causer of thys taxe and tribute paiynge, both hym and diuers of
hys housholde seruauntes, furiously and shamefully murthered &amp; kylled.
Diuers afferme that the Northenmen bare agaynst thys erle continuall
grudge, sith the death of kyng Rychard, whome they entirely loued
and highly fauoured, whiche secret serpēt caused their fury to wade
farther then reason coulde retract or restreyne. Althoughe thys offence

were great and heynous, yet ther succeded after a more mischief and a
greater inconuenience. For incontinent the Northenmē to cloke the homicide
and manslaughter, by a violence put on their armure and assembled
in

                  ockes, and elected to theim a capitayne called syr Ihon Egremonde
knyght, a person no lesse sedicious then faccious and desirous
of trouble, and ordred them selfes lyke men of warre, and passynge by
the countreys, they published and declared that thei would byd battail
to the kynge, onely for the tuicion and defence of their common libertye
and fredome, whiche he woulde plucke, and by hys extreme power take
&amp; bereue frō thē. But when their cause should be discided with blowes
&amp; handstrokes, their fury was asswaged &amp; refrigerate, their hartes were
in their heeles, &amp; theyr stomackes as coulde as any stone, &amp; euery one
wished yt this tumult were retracted &amp; quēched which was now al ready
not smokynge but enflamed: And in cōclusion, euery man tanne awaye,
some this way, &amp; some that way, as men amased when they lacke counsail,
skatered &amp; dispersed in diuers places. When euery mā was returned,
the mattre was ended as they imagened, but while they diligently
laboured to saue their lifes by flight, thei sought their awne destrucciō.
For the moost parte of thē were punyshed by death or by imprysoment
for thesame offence. For the kyng heryng of this tumulteous busynes,
sent forth Thomas erle of Surrey, whome not lōg after he had deliuered
out of ye Toure, &amp; receaued to his grace &amp; especial fauour (as he was
both for his wit &amp; fidelite wel worthy) with a cōpetent crewe of mē into

slaues &amp; sturdy rebelles were so abashed &amp; afrayed, that thei fled more &amp;

of all other. But syr Ihon Egremōd, whome these sedicious persons
preferred to be their Capitayn, fled into Flaūders to ye lady Margaret
duches of Butgoyne, whiche euer enuied the prosperite of kynge

               When this folishe enterprice was thus quenched, the kyng gaue cō

&amp; charge to syr Rychard Tunstall knyght, a man of great wyt,
pollecie &amp; discrecion, to gather and receaue the subsidie to hym dewe of
the people, and he hym selfe returned shortely to London, leauynge the
erle of Surrey to rule the Northpartes, perceauynge well the Englishmen,
not so muche to grudge at the paymente of the taxe or tribute, as
they did grone at the excessyue and importable some vpon thē assessed,

remembryng the olde prouerbe, loue me litle and loue me longe. And
thys was the yere of our Lorde .M.cccc.xc. and the fourth yere of thys
kynges reigne.
               Before this tyme, Maximiliaen kynge of Romanes, whiche as you
haue heard in the tyme of kynge Edwarde the .iiii. had contrary to the
mynde and will of the French kyng espoused lady Marie, daughter &amp;
heyre to Lewes the Frenche kynge, and by her had issue, a sonne called
Philip, and Margaret whiche was affied to Charles the .vii. Frenche
kyng and by hym repudiate and forsaken, was sore offended &amp; greatly
greued with the Flemynges, but moost of all with the Eauntoys and
Brugians, for kepyng from him perforce hys sonne &amp; heyre duke Philip,
whiche neither by gentle request nor cruell menace woulde deliuer
the sonne to hys natural father and lawful parent. Wherfore the king
Maximiliaen assembled a company of Almaynes &amp; Ouerlanders (for
he did not greatly put hys confidence in the Brabanders nor Hollanders)
and made sharpe warre on the Flemynges, in the whiche he litle
preuayled. For the Fleminges sent to the Frenche kynge for aide &amp; succour,
whiche beyng glad of that request, s

                  nt Philip de Creuecure lorde
Desquerdes, commonly called the lorde Cordes into the confines of
Flaunders with a great army of men, to aide and succour the Fleminges,
trustynge by that meanes to obteyne bothe the possession of ye yong
enfaunt duke Philip, and the whole countrey of Flaunders. Wherfore
Maximilian entending to allure the Flemynges from the Frenchmen,
beganne first to practise with them of Bruges, of whiche toune the grauous
men, sone condiscended and astipulat to reason, requyringe hym
to come to their toune, and sent to hym with their request, the Scult called
Peter Longoll with diuers other, to aduertise hym that at hys cō
                  mynge
thither, he should fynde hym conformable to hys will, pleasure
and request. Upon trust wherof he entred into the toune finally accompanyed,
and came before the toune, thinkyng that the lordes and senate
woulde ioyously haue receaued and welcōmed hym. But the whole turned
cleane contrary, for the light witted persons, to whome peace was
treason, and concord venemous poyson, takyng this occasion to theim
offred, cryed to harneys. When they, whiche had brought the kyng into
the toune, sawe the tumult of the people, and that no man came to their
relief, they left their lord post alone, and fled into corners. The warden
of the smythes was the chief of the route, which bad the kyng to take pacience
a whyle, and he should haue a gentle enprysonement, and so conueighed
hym to the house of Ihon Grosse, iudge of the audience. Then
the Almaynes were all banished, the toune and the lordes of Gaūt were
sent for, which taried not longe. When they had the praye that they espected,
fyrst diuers citezens whiche they thought fauourable to Maximiliaen
they beheaded. Mathew Spert, one of hys chief counsailours
and trusty frendes, was sent to Gaunt, and there put to death. Iames
Dudenezell, &amp; Iames of here .ii. wyse burgeses, notwithstandynge that

all the priestes and religious of the toune made intercession for theim,

kept two yeres agaynst the power of Maximilian, till he rendred theim
to syr Edward Pownynges sent thether by the kynge of Englande, as
you shall hereafter well perceaue. Beside this, the foresayde Philip not
onely exacted and stirred the Gauntoys, Brugians and other tounes
of Flaunders, to rebell agaynst their souereygne lorde, but also sent to
the lorde Cordes, to aide hym to conquere suche tounes of Flaunders,
as were not of their opinion and confederacy. This lord Cordes, which
vntruly reuolted from duke Charles of Burgoyne, beyng hys brynger
vp and chief preferrer to Lewes the Frēch kyng (as you haue heard before)
was glad of thys, and so sent to the aide of the Fleminges .viii.M
Frenchmen, willyng them to take and conquere such tounes, as were in
the waye betwene Fraunce and Bruges, or Caleys and Bruges. The
Capitaynes folowynge hys deuice, beseged a litle walled toune, called
Dipenew, to whome came .iiii.M. Flemynges with vitayle and artillary,
sent from Philip Mounseur. They layed siege on the Northsyde
of the toune in a marishe groūde then beyng drye, and so depely dyched
their campe, and so highly trenched it, on which trenche they layed their
ordinaunce, that it was in maner impossible to entre into their campe, or
to do them any displeasure or dammage. The kynge of Englande was
dayly aduertised of these doynges, whiche nothing lesse desyred then to
haue the Euglish pale and territory enuyroned with French fortresses.
For he perceaued well that if the Frēchemē gate Dipenewe, they would
afterward assaile Newport and Grauelynge, and cōsequently, what wt
force and what with corrupcion of rewardes, their purpose was to haue
the possession of duke Philip and all Flaunders, whiche shoulde not be
to the profite of hym nor hys subiectes. Wherfore this .v. yere, sodeinly
with great expedicion he sent ouer to the lord Dawbeney to Caleys, the
lord Morley with a Crewe of valiaunt archers and souldiours, to the

               When they were lāded, they published and sayed that they came to defende
the English pale, if the Frenchemen or Flemynges would attēpt

soueraygne of Flaūders with .vi.C. Almaynes, and there they commoned
and paused that nyght.
               On the next day as they came secretly toward Dipinew (se ye chaūce)
at a place of execucion, nere the high waye was a Gaūtoys (which was

come out of the army for a spye, and apprehēded by them of Dipenew)
led to hangyng, which emongest the Englishmē knew syr Iames Tyrrell,
and called to hym for comfort and succoure, promisynge hym that
if he woulde saue hys lyfe, he woulde guyde theim where they shoulde
entre on the Gauntoys, to their honour and aduauntage, and he would
be the first assaylaunt of all the company. When hys promes was regarded,
after request made to the Borough masters and capitaynes of
the toune, he was perdoned but not deliuered. The next daye in ye mornyng,
after they had ordred their army, their guyde conueyghed theim
out at the Southgate of the toune by a high banke set with willowes,
so that the Gauntoysses coulde not wel espie them, and so secretly came
to the ende of the campe of their enemyes and there paused. The lorde
Daubeney commaunded al men to sende their horses &amp; wagons backe,
but the lord Morley sayde he woulde ryde tyll he came to handstrokes
(but he was deceaued) so they passed on tyll they came to a lowe bancke
and no depe dyche, where their ordinaunce laye, and there the archers
shote altogether euery man an arrowe, and so fell prostrate to ye groūd,
their enemyes discharged their ordinaunce all atones, and ouershot thē
The archers roase and shot agayn, and bet them from their ordinaūce.
The Almaynes lept ouer the dyche with their morishe pykes, the Englishmen
in the forefront waded the dyche, and were holpen vp by the
Almaynes, and set on their enemies, and slew and toke many prisoners.
The other Englishmen hasted by the cawsey to entre in at the Northgate
of the campe, where the lrod Morley being on horsoacke in a ryche
coate was slayne with a gonne. When hys death was knowen, euery
man kylled hys prysoner, and flew all such as did withstād them to the
number of .viii.M. men, in somuch that of .ii.M. that came out of Bruges
(as the Flemysh chronicle reporteth) there came not home an hundred.
There were slayne in the sayd place two chief Capitaynes, George
Peccanet, and Anthony Nyewnhome. On the English parte was slayn
the lord Morley, and not an hundred moo. The Englishmen toke their
ordinaunce and sent it to Newport with al their spoyle and great horsses.
And by the waye, hearyng certayne Frenchmē to be at Ostend, they
made thetherward, but the Frenchmen fled, and so they burned parte of
the toune, and came agayne to Newport, where the lord Dawbeney left
all the Englishmen that were hurt or wounded, and caryed with hym
the dead corpus of the lorde Morley, and buryed it honorably at Caleys.
Thys felde was profitable to the Englishmen, for they that went
forth in clothe, came home in sylke, and they that wēt out on foote, came
home on great horsses, suche is the chaunce of victory.
               The lorde Cordes, beyng at Yper with .xx.M. men, was sore discontent
with this ouerthrowe, wherfore he thynkyng to be reuenged, came
and beseged the toune of Newport strōgely (the which capitayne, Mō
                  seur
de Merwede, before capitayne of Dipenew, and all the gentelmen
of Westflaunders, and the thre principall cities of Flaunders, viteyled

the Frenche hoost so wel that all thinges was to good chepe) they without
shot at the walles, and brake thē in many places, and they within
sore greued them without with their artillary. But the Englishmen y•
were hurt at Dixmewe felde before, and might eyther stand or drawe a
bowe, neuer came from the walles. One daye the Frenchmen gaue a
great assaute to a Towre, and perforce entred it, and set vp the banner
of the lorde Cordes: but as God woulde, during the time of the assaute
there arryued from Caleys, a Barke with .lxxx. fresh Englishe archers,
which came streight to the Towre. The womē of the toune, perceiuinge
the Englishmen come, cryed with lamentable and loude voyces, helpe
Englishmen, helpe Englishmen, shote Englishmen, shote Englishmen,
so that, what with the helpe of such as before were wounded and hurte
men, and of the courageous hartes of the new come Archers, and the
stoute stomackes and diligency of the women, which as fast as the Englishmen
strake doune the enemyes, the women were ready to cut theyr
throtes, they wanne agayne the Towre, and slewe the Frenchmen, &amp; rēt
the banner of the lorde Cordes, and set vp the penon of saynct George.
Then the Frenchmē, supposyng a great aide of Englishemen, to haue
bene come to the toune by sea, left the assaulte. And the night folowyng
the coueteous lord Cordes (which so sore lōged for Caleys, yt he would
commonly saye that he woulde gladly lye .vii. yeres in hell, so yt Caleys
were in the possession of the Frenchmen) brake vp hys siege and shamefully
returned to Hesdyng. And the Englishmen glad of this victory
returned agayne to Caleys.
               This yere also, the realme of Scotlād suffered an infeccious &amp; mortall
plage, because the name of Iames the thyrd kyng of Scottes was
so odyous, so hated and disdayned of the whole nobilitie of the realme
of Scotlande, chiefly because they perceaued that he set more by vile
borne vileyns and light persones, then by the princes and nobles of
hys realme, as I haue declared to you in the history of kyng Edward
the .iiii. which mischiefe and vngrate discommoditie, after thei had tollerated
and paciently suffred no smal tyme to their great grudge &amp; displeasour.
They now thought it most expediēt for their purpose &amp; welfare,
euen by force of armes to recouer their pristinate libertie and auncient
freedome. Therefore makyng preuely a coniuraciō and cōspiracy
together agaynst their prynce and soueraigne lorde, cōpassed his death
and destruccion. Yet that it mighte not be thoughte that they did
intende the destruccion of their natyue countrey, they made the kynges
sonne named after hys father Iames, prince of Rothsay (a chylde
borne to goodnes and vertue) their Capitayne, in maner agaynste hys
will, openly protesting, that they purposed the confusion, affliccion and
deposyng of an euell kynge and wretched prynce, and not the subuersion
&amp; destrucciō of their coūtrey: by which craftie ymagened inuēcion
they might eyther cloke or propulse from thē all suspicion, of their purposed
vntruthe and shamefull disloyaltye. Wherof the kynge beynge

credibly informed, was pensyfe, sorie, carefull, vexed and sore formēted
in his mynd for thys cause in especiall, that he should haue cyuile dissencion
with hys awne subiects and natiue country men, yee &amp; agaynst
his awne sonne beynge made Capyteyne of that vntrewe and peruerse
company, whome next to him selfe he loued, fauoured and honoured,
ymagenynge with him selfe that this cōmocyon sounded to none other
effect but that the hed should fight and stryue wyth the other mēbres
and partes of the naturall body: and yet on the other syde, not to resyst
shortly theyr newe incepted entreprice might easely encourage &amp; inflame
the malicious heartes of his domesticall enemyes with more boldenes
&amp; audacite to attēpt farther mischef &amp; incōueniēce. Therfore to thē
                  tent
to make a plaster for both these sores to be healed: Fyrst to apease
and assuage the fury and rumour of the people, beyng this in a rage, he
prepared an army of mē. After that he sent Ambassadours to his sonne
and the nobilitee assembled with him, for a loue, peace, concorde, quiet
                     •
                  nes
and vnitee to be concluded emongest them. Also he sent letters to ye
kynge of Englande and the French kynge, requyringe them that they
woulde vouchesafe with their good and Godly counsail, helpe &amp; assaye
to mitigate and asswage this furious enormitie of his rude and sauage
people, which was incepted and begonne thorough the perswasion and
procurement of certeine pernicious and sedicious persones. And besides
this, he wrote to the bishop of Rome Innocēt for thesame matter,
in the which he earnestly obtested, desyred &amp; prayed him that he would
of his goodnes, fayth &amp; charite sende some one legate to these rebelles
of his nobilitie to charge and commaunde, that they settynge aside all
warre and hostilite, embrace quietnes, rest and vnitee.
               This miserable decrepite and aged kyng, thinkynge that bothe delaiynge
and continuaunce of time, and also the entreating and hartye
prayers of hys frendes and alies would quenche and mollefie their inordinate
wildenes and furious rage, and persuade thē to sobriete and
good conformite, had rather with these, and other sembleable medecynes
remedie this yonge springyng sore, then he woulde haue it experimented,
and tryed with cyuyle battaile and intestine destruccion▪ which
he thought to be a thing bothe vngodly, vnnatural and execrable. For
all this, no medecyne, no coūsail, no wholsome preceptes could appease
or pacefie the angry myndes and ragynge wittes of the Scottishe nobilitie,
so much were they addicted and bent too this folye and vnreasonable
madnes. In so much, as to the messengers sent from him to thē
beyng their soueraygne lorde, they made this vnreasonable and vnhonest
aunswer, that is: yf he would resigne the tytle of his croune &amp; realm
and depose him selfe of hys royall dignite, then they would cōmen with
hym of a peace, or els their eares were stopped from heryng of any entreatie
or perswasion. Thesame aunswer broughte the Ambassadour of
Englande and Fraunce to their princes, whiche sore lamented and deplored
the peruerse fortune and mischaunce of their frēde the Scottish

kynge, as though they had bene partakers of hys afflicciō: But Adriā
the bishop of Romes legate, of whome we will speake more hereafter
came to late, and as who should saye, a daye after the faire.
               When nothynge coulde moue or perce these stony hartes or frosty
myndes of the nobilitie of Scotland: In conclusion they met together
in a pitched feclde, where after great slaughter of many men, the
poore sely kynge fled into a Myll for succoure, whether he was folowed
and prosecuted, and there shamefully murthered, and vnreuerently,
(not lyke a prynce or a crouned kynge) left starke naked lyke a stinkyng
caryon. Then the prynces of Scotland beynge saciat and filled
with the blood and slaughter of their soueraygne lorde and kynge
(thynkinge that they had well reuenged the olde displeasures to theim
done and committed by kyng Iames the thirde) set vp in the trone and
estate royall, the prince hys sonne, and named hym Iames the .iiii. of
that name.
               Before this tyme, as you haue heard, Innocēt bishop of Rome had
sent in legacy Adryan of Castella, a man of hetouria, borne in y• toune
of Cornere, called in the olde tyme Newcastel, which should haue gone
to Scotlande, too haue pacefied by hys authoritie and commaundement
thys troublesome busynes, moued and sturred betwene the kyng
and hys subiectes. Yet this man, although he made many great iourneys,
when he came to England, was enformed of the kynge, to whome
he hadde certayne commaundementes and messages to saye from the
Romyshe Bishop, that he came to late for too accomplysh the commission
of hys legacy, asserteynynge him that the Scottishe kynge was
dead, gentely aduisinge hym, that he should not moue one foote ferther
but tary still in Englande, wehre he was not past twoo dayes, but that
he was playnly certefied by the Bishops of Scotlande of the kynges
death. This Adryan taryed certayne monethes after this in Englād
and was made muche of, and highly commended and lawded too the
kyng by Ihon Morton bishop of Caunterbury, whiche for the good
learnyng, vertue, &amp; humanite, that he sawe and perceaued to be in him
shewed to hym all poyntes of humanite and frendshippe, that a frende
might do to a frende. And vpon hys commendacion, the kynge thynkynge
thys man woorthy to be looked vpon, and mete to do the kynge
pleasure, muche phantasied and more fauoured this legate Adryan, in
somuche as he was Oratour and solicited his cause, bothe to Innocēt
and also to Alexander the sixt, Bishops of Rome. And after this, for
his diligent seruyce, he so loued and fauoured him y• he made him Bisshop
of Herford, and shortely after, that resigned &amp; geuen ouer, he promoted
hym to the Bishoprike of Welles and Bathe. And not longe
after this Adryan was returned with these honoures to Rome, where
he was promoted successiuely by all the degrees of spiritual dignitees
into the Colledge and societee of Cardinalles. For Innocent fyrste
made him his Collectour in England, and also one of .vii. Prothonotaries.

After this Alexander the .vi. had hym as one of hys priuye
counsayll, and promoted him to the degree of a Cardinall: But who is
that I praye you that will meruell at this, which aswell maye be geuē
to fooles and dyzerdes as to wise and well learned men? There is another
prayse of this Adrian, and thesame in maner eternall: The manne
was of profounde learninge and knowlege, not vulgare, but straunge,
newe and difficile, and in especial he was a manne or a ripe iudgement
in electinge and chosynge concinnate termes, and apte and eloquente
woordes, whiche firste of our tyme, after that golden worlde of Tully,
moued men with hys writynge to imitate and foloe the moost approbate,
and allowed authours that were of eloquēcte, and taught y• trade
and phrase to speake fyne, pure, freshe and cleane latyn, soo that by hys
example and documēt, eloquēce flourisheth at this houre in all places
of Christendome, wherfore after my iudgemēt he is not woorthie to be
put in obliuion: but now to my purpose.
            
            
               The vi. yere.
               
                  THe Britishe affaires in the meane ceason, because that all
discorde was not pacefied and appeased, beganne agayne
nowe to flowe out and to trouble, and set all thynges in a
newe broyle and busynes. For Maximilian kynge of Romaynes
beynge without a wife, before this tyme, made

                     •
                  uite to Fraūces duke of Briteyne, to haue in mariage the lady Anne
hys daughter, to the whiche request the duke gentely condiscended.
               And one, whiche by proxie wooed for him: too the entent that the lady
shoulde performe that she promysed on her fayth and honour, he vsed a
new inuenciō and tricke, after this maner: When the lady did take her
chambre, the night after the affiaunce, she was layed naked in the bridebed,
in the presence of diuerse noble matrones and Prynces, called thether
as witnesses. The procuratour or Deputie for the husbande
whiche represented his person, was layde in the place of her husbande,
and put one of hys legges into she bed vp to the harde knee, in the sight
and compaigny of many noble personages, as who said that the virgin
had bene carnally knowen, and so the matrimouy perfighte and consummate,
and they two as man &amp; wyfe. But thys fonde new founde ceremony
was little regarded and lesse estemed, of hym that onely studyed
and watched, howe to surrept and steale thys turtle oute of her
mewe and lodgynge. For Charles the Frenche kynge (as no mā can
blame hym) was desyrous and gredy too be coupled in mariage, wyth
so great an inheritoure, and reputynge the mariage made with Maximilian,
to be of no validite and effect, the more busely and incessantly
he made sharpe warre, &amp; skourged the Brytōnes, to thentent he might
bothe haue the lady and her dominions also at hys will and pleasure.
But he imagined that the kynge of Englande woulde caste a trumpe

in hys waye, and be an impediment to hys purpose by sendynge into
Britayne a newe army of Englishemen, for he had intelligence by his
preuy fautours.
               Kynge Henry and Ferdinando kyng of Spaygne, were fully decreed
to aide, assist and defende the duches and duchie of Briteyn, in al ieopardies
and aduentures, to thentent that they agaynst their wil and
affeccion should not be by force compelled, to submit them selfes to the
subieccion and ponderous yoke of the Frenche kynge. For the whiche
cause, these two princes were ioyned in a league and confederacy to resist
and propulse thys manifest wronge and apparant iniurie. Wherfore
he sent in all post hast the lord Fraūces of Luxenborough, Charles
Marignane, aud Robert Gagime, ministre of the bone homes of the
Trinitee, to kyng Henry for a peace to be confirmed &amp; had, which whē
they came before the kynges presence, were accepted and entreteyned
after the best maner. And when thei were demaunded of theffect of their
legacion, their request was that kyng Charles, as chiefe and supreme
lorde ouer the seignorie &amp; duchye of Briteyne, might without any spot
of ingratitude to be imagined or conceaued by kynge Henry, lawfully
ordre and dispose at his wil and pleasure the mariage of lady Anne of
Briteyne, as hys ward &amp; orphan, without any let and disturbaunce of
the kynge of Englād, or any of his alies and confederates. Kyng Hēry
thereto would not condiscende, but still harped on thys stryng, that the
virgyn, whiche was lawfully combyned in matrymony with Maximilian
kynge of Romans, shoulde nto be compelled agaynste her wil and
promes (beynge contrary to all lawe, right and equitie) too take any other
person then hym to her spouse and husband, for that it was clerely
repugnaunt to all veritie and lawe, both of God and man. So when
they had lyngred the tyme, and consumed many dayes in vayne argumentes
and superfluous reasons, without any of their rquestes obteyned:
after longe debatyng and consultacion, they were resolued on this
poynte, least it shoulde be thoughte that all their legacion had bene in
vayne and brought to no efficacie or purpose, a forme of a league and
amitie shoulde be drawen with condicions, clauses and couenauntes.
And for the farther furtheraunce of that purpose, it was thoughte necessary
and expedient that the kynge of Englande shoulde sende Ambassadours
to the Frenche kynge, whiche in hys name and by his authoritee
might breuely conclude and finishe the league and treatie that
was in communicacion incepted and begonne. Whereupon kynge
Henry dismissed the Frenche Ambassadours laden with ample &amp; large
rewardes into their countrey, and dispatched and sent streyghte after
them by hys commission and authorite, Thomas erle of Ormond, and
Thomas Goldeston, prior of Christes churche in Cauntourbury hys
Orators and Ambassadours, to Charles the French kyng, instructing
them fully of all thinges that we would haue either moued or determined.
               
                  
In this meane space, Alexander bishop of Rome ye .vi. of that name
whiche succeded after Innocent, a man full of diligēce and of wit pregnant,
sent Lyonell bishop of Concorde legate, to the Frenche kyng for
certaine matters, and emong other thinges, gaue him in charge to conclude
a peace and vinitie betwene king Charles and king Henry. Whē
he had declared his message to the French kynge fully, and had easely
obteyned all thinges that he requyred, then he beganne to moue vnto
the French kyng and hys nobles, with a longe and prolixe exhortacion
to make and conclude a perpetuall peace, betwene him and the kyng of
Englande. And when he perceaued the Frenchemen to make no greate
denyall to hys request, he determyned to attempt and moue kyng Hēry
to concente and agree too thesame desyre and peticion: and toke hys
iourney towardes England, and at Caleys he encountred the Ambassadours,
bothe of Englande and of Fraunce, which receaued hym into
the toune of Caleys, with many ceremonies and great reuerēce. Where
after they had communed the matter a certayn space, as cōcerning their
affaires and busynes, they departed toward the Frēch kyng, &amp; the Bisshop
was transported into England. The kyng honorably receaued &amp;
gentely entret
                     •
                  yned this Orator Lyonell, and gaue good eare to hys

                     •
                  uculent &amp; eloquent oracion, wherin he persuaded him with many flatteryng
and glosinge woordes, to entre into a league and amitie with
kyng Charles of Fraunce, and the Frenche nacion. To the whiche request
the kyng made aunswer that he woulde be glad and ioyous, if it
might be compassed and brought aboute, after lōge trouble and pernicious
dissencion to lyue in peace and mutual amite with all christēmē.
Bishop Lyonel perceauyng the kynges mynde and intent, reculed agayn
to Fraunce with all spede and diligence (and as it was mete and
decent for the bishop of Concord) he determined to extirpate and dryue
oute of the kynges memory all olde reconynges and iniuries done too
him heretofore, and plant if it might be, in his hart and minde, the very
goodly and gracious greyne of concord and vnitie.
               The Englishe Ambassadours, then beynge with the Frenche kynge
purposed and setforth articles and conclusions of peace. The Frenchmen
prudently made aunswer, so that on bothe parties the matter was
pollitiquely and artificially proponed and oppugned. The Englishe
Ambassadours, to thentent that they might assente and obtayne of fewe
thinges, whiche they muche desired, required &amp; demaunded many great
and diuerse thinges. The Frenchmen on the other side, mynding to assent
to no one demaund at thend, did denye &amp; repudiate all Thenglishmens
desyres, and condicions, and were sore angry and moued with
their great requestes and high demaundes. And in the meane ceason,
trustyng more to their coffers then to their cheualry, as the maner of
theyr countrey is, for to obteyn their purpose▪ they spare not to disburse
and launche out treasure, giftes and rewardes innumerable, whiche is
the very cause that they conquere more with crounes of gold, then with

speare and shylde, or dynt of swerde in battaile. So that shortely after
the Frenche kyng, sent to ye noble men of Briteyn great &amp; many rewardes,
solicityng▪ exhortyng and praiyng them al to become his subiectes
and vassals. And in especiall he allured and enticed with moost flatrerynge
woordes and trappynge termes, the lady Anne by such honorable
matrones and ladies, as had the gouernaunce and educacion of her
to confirme her self true to him in due obedience and loue, and not disdeyne
to be coupled in such a noble mariage, with so high and mightie
a prynce, as kyng Charles was. And least perauenture the Damosell
fearyng the rigour of the Ecclesiasticall lawes woulde not consent too
hym for offending her conscience and infringyng her promes: To aduoyde
that scruple, he caused diuerse to inculcate and put in her hed &amp;
tyttle in her eare, that the mariage made with Maximilian was of no
strēgth and lesse efficacy, considrynge that it was concluded and made
without the consent, agrement and will of him, which is the chiefe lorde
and ought to haue the gouernaunce ouer her as his warde, &amp; the whole
duchy of Briteyne, assuring her that she was deluded, and that the mariage
with Maximilian was neuer consummate nor perfight. And this
was the very cause that no sure concorde or peace could be concluded &amp;
agreed betwene these two Prynces. And where as the Frēch kyng had
long kept with hym the lady Margaret, daughter to Maximilian and
her solemply espoused at Amboys, he sayde that that mariage might be
lawfully dissolued agayne, because the lady was of that age, that she
coulde neither be geuen nor yet taken in mariage, for whiche cause he
might lawfully repudiate and honestly put her from him.
               By this crafte and perswasion they led and entised the fayre maydē,
suspectyng none euell, and brought her to thys poynt, that in conclusion,
she beyng proclaymed by diuers, Prynces of Briteyne, subornate
and corrupted with mede contrary to their duetie and allegeaūce, was
content to condissende and agree to that the Frenchmen demaunded, &amp;
not onely to submit her selfe to the French kyng, but also to take him to
her make and husband, by the reason whereof the warre mighte ceasse,
whiche with violencie and impression of thesame, had infested and afflicted
all her whole countrey. To this mariage agreed all the nobilitie
of Briteyne, which helde of the French parte, thinkinge it verily for the
auauncement of the common weale and their ease, because to trust to y•
power of Maximilian, which vas of no puyssaūce, they thought it veyne
and of no efficacy. And when the Frēch kyng had composed and ordred
hys matters of this fassion, preuely with the lady Anne, he accelerated
the mariage with all the expedicion and diligence that was possible:
So that the English Ambassadours returned agayn to their coū
                  trey,
and nothing doen or agreed vpon their matter.
               Kyng Henry, still paciently forbearynge and suffryng till such time
that he perceaued more playnly what way the worlde went: and vnderstandyng
before the returne of hys Ambassadours, that the Frenchmen

me
                     •
                  ned none other but playne guyle, fraude and deceipte, determined
no more with peaseable legacions, but with opē warre to finish and determyn
all controuersies and displeasures betwene him and the French
kyng. Wherfore he sommoned his courte of Parliament, and there declared
first y• cause why he was iustly prouoked to make warre agai
                     •
                  st
the Frenche kyng: And after desyred them of their beneuolent aide of
men and money for the maintenaunce of thesame. The cause of this battaill,
euery man did allowe and approbate, and to the settynge foorth of
thesame, promysed their industrie, labour and all that they could make.
The kynge commendynge them for their true and louynge hartes, too
thentent he might not aggraute the common people, with paiynge of
great taxes and summes of money, whome his mynde was euer to kepe
in fauour, woulde fyrst exacte money by a litle &amp; a litle of y• beneuolent
mynde of the ryche sorte, and this kynde of exaccion was first excogi

he consulted with his frendes,
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   to inuent howe to gather together a
great summe of money, and published abrode that by their open giftes
he woulde measure and searche their beneuolent hartes &amp; louing myndes
towarde hym, so that he that gaue mooste shoulde be iudged to be
mooste louyng frende, and he that gaue litle, to be estemed accordynge
to his gifte: By this a man maye apparauntly perceaue as it were for
a great common wealth, that, that thinge that is once practised for the
vtilitee of a prynce, and broughte too a president by matter of recorde,
maye be turned to the great preiudice of the people, if rulers in authoritie
will so adiudge and determyn it. So by thys meanes the kynge
gathered innumerable summes of money, with some grudge of the people
for the extremitee shewed by the commissioners in dyuerse places.
               You haue heard before how Philip Mounsure, lord of Raueston by
the aide of Bruges &amp; Gaunt had taken the toune &amp; .ii. castels of Sluys
and was become aduersarie to Maximilian, by reason of the .iii. chiefe
cytyes of Flaunders: Now ye shall vnderstand that he did not onely so
fortefie as wel with municions as men, both the toune and .ii. Castels,
but also gat into the hauen diuerse shippes and barkes, &amp; by this meanes
he spoyled and toke prysoners all nacions, passing eyther by sea or
by land to the mart at Antwarp, or into Brabant, Zeeland or Frisland
and was euer plentifully viteyled out of Fraunce and Pycardy, to the
great dammage of the Englishmen, which were spoyled dayly and taken
prysoners: Which thinge Maximilian kynge of Romanes coulde
not wel remedy, nor the kyng of England without great coste and losse
of men. For to it behoued an army, bothe by sea and lande, for when he
was set for by lande, he fled to the sea: And when he was chaced on the
sea, he soughte refuge in hys twoo stronge Towers, and euer he had
succours from Bruges and Gaunt. Nowe was here a litle toune two

myle from Bruges, toward the sea calle Damme, whiche was a Bulwerke
to Bruges, and a hedsprynge to Sluys. The kynge of Romanes
did oftentymes attempt the apprehendinge of this toune, to the entent
that the Brugians should haue no recourse to the hauē of Sluys,
nor the Sluysians should haue no succour out of the toune of Bruges.
But there were slayne a great number of gentlemen of Germany, for
they within made no signe of defence, tyl all their enemies were in their
daunger, and so slewe and confuted theim. There was a greate duke
in Almayne, called duke Albert of the vpper Saxony, a greate frende
to the kyng of Romanes, whiche made hym selfe Neuter, and neuer intermitted
wyth the affayres of Flaūders, a man of no lesse pollecy then
valyaunt hardynes. This duke requyred of the lordes of Bruges,
that he might enter peaceably into their toune, accordynge to his estate
with a certayne numbre of menne of armes to communicate with them
dyuerse matters of great weyght and no small importaunce, and sent
before hys cariages and herbingers to make prouision. The estates of
Bruges little doubted to admit so small a numbre into so populous a
company, ye though the numbre were duplicate, and especially, because
they harde saye that he woulde lodge in the toune all night, wherefore
no man thought of that craftie stratageme that he had inuented. Hys
elected and warlike company entred into the cytie in good ordre, and
he folowed, they that went before inquyred after ynnes and lodgynges
as though they woulde repose them selfes there all nighte, and so went
foorth still in ordre askynge for lodgyng, till they came to the gate that
goeth directly towarde the forsayde toune of Dam, distant from Bruges
a Flemysh myle, which is called the Bulwerke of Bruges. The
Capitaynes and inhabitauntes of the toune of Damme, suspecting no
harme to come out of Bruges, thinkinge that their frendes knowynge
some sodeyn chaunce comming to haue sent to them aide and succours,
and so nothinge mistrustinge, did let them entre, and take the toune of
Damme, and so that toune, whiche coulde not be wonne by force of armes,
was by a sleight &amp; pollecy attrapped and surprised to the great detriment
and displeasure of the toune of Bruges, for now had they no recourse
to the sea, which stop so continuyng, no doubte, but the toune of
Bruges must nedes fall in ruyne and vtter exterminion.
               When duke Albert of Saxony had gotten Dam, he certefied ye king
of England ye he would besege Sluyse by lād, if it pleased his maiestie
to ministre any aide by the sea. King Hēry which was wise, &amp; forcasting
in all his affaires, remēbryng that Sluyse was the denne of theues to
thē y• trauerse y• seas toward the East parties, incontinēt dispatched syr
Edward Pownīges, (a valiaūt knight &amp; hardy Capitayn) wt .xii. shippes
wel furnished wt bolde souldiours &amp; strōg artillary. Which syr Edward
sayled īto ye hauē, &amp; kept Philip moūsure frō stertīg by ye sea. The
duke of Saxō beseged ye one castel, liyng in a church ouer agaīst it, &amp; ye
Englishmē assauted y• lesse castel dayly, &amp; issued out of ye shippes at the

and although they stode in the water to the knees, yet they neuer gaue
their enemies one daye to repose or playe by the space of .xx. dayes, and
euery daye slewe some of their aduersaries, and on the Englishe parte
were slayne. Uerte brother to the Erle of Oxforde &amp; fifty moo.
               The lorde Philip of Rauestone, had made a bridge of boates betwene
both the Castels, by the which one might succour ye other, Which
bridge the Englishmen in a night set on fyer. Then, he perceauinge y•
he must nedes lese his castels by force, &amp; that the Fleminges could not
aide him, yelded the castels to syr Edward Powninges, and the toune
to the duke of Saxony, vpon certayne condicions. When the duke and
the English capitayne met in the toune, there was betwene them great
salutacions, and syr Edward kept the Castels a while, of whome y• Almaynes
demaunded stipend and salary, because that the duke had nothynge
to paye. Then these two capitaynes so hādled them of Bruges
that they were content not onely, to submit thē selues to the lord Maximilian,
but also to paye &amp; dispatche the Almaynes. And so syr Edward
Pownynges taried there a longe space, and returned to the kynge before
Boleyne. And so they, which by reasonable ordre, would not be gouerned:
by vnreasonable condicions were broughte to conformyte and
ordre.
               The .vi. daye of Aprill this present yere, the kynge commaunded all
the nobilite of hys realme, to assemble at the Cathedral church of sainct
Paule in London, where after Te deum solemply songe, the Cardinal
of Caunterbury, standynge on the steppes before the queer dore, declared
to the people, how the famous citie of Granado, which many yeres
had bene possessed of the Moores or Mawritane nacion, beyng infideles
&amp; vnchristened people, and now of late beseeged by a great tyme by
Donfernando and Elisabeth hys wyfe, kynge and quene of Spayne,
Arragon and Castell. And thesayde infideles, by reason of this siege
brought to great penurye and miserie, for lacke of viteile and necessary
viand, perceauyng that all succours were clerely estopped and propulsed
from them, and so brought into vtter despaire of aide or comforte:
after longe consultacion had emongest them, determyned to rendre thē
selues and their citie, to thesayde kyng, vpon diuerse couenauntes and
condicions, and therupon sent to hym diuerse Senatours of the citie,
fully ins
                     •
                  ructed of their mynd and purpose. The kyng of Spayne and
his counsail, considering and sagely ponderinge that wynter approched
and was at hande, and that the Christen hoost had long lyen in y•
feeldes in sore tempestes and greuous stormes (which they gladly suffred
for Christes sake, in whose cause and quarel thei made that present
warre) remembrynge also that the cytie was of suche ryches, fame and
estimacion, that it conteyned an hundred and fifty thousand houses of
name, beside other small houses and cotages, and that it was replenisshed
with people innumerable, and furnished with .lxx. thousand good
fightyng men. And finally, perceauyng that he might enioye nowe the

possession of thesame, without assaulte or effusion of Christen blood, by
the aduyse of hys counsayll, he accepted, accorded and agreed to theyr
offres the .xxv. of Nouember, in the yere of Christes incarnacion. M.cccc.xci.
then beyng the daye of saynct Katheryn. By the which composicion,
the royall citie of Granado, with all the holdes and fortresses of
the realme, and the Towres and Castels of Alpussarare was rendred
into the handes of thesayde kyng of Speygne, &amp; that the kyng of Granado
should become subiect and vassall to the kyng of Speygne, and
to relinquishe and forsake the vsurped name of a kyng for euer. And y•
all men of warre should franckly departe out of the citie, and none ther
to remayne, but artificers and merchauntes, and all these thinges to be
done before the .xxv day of Ianuary, but the tyme was anticipate, for y•
Moores on the first daye of Ianuarij, sent .vi.C. notable personages
out of the citie with their chyldren for hostages into the campe of the
kynge of Spayne, to thentent that he should put no diffidēce nor mistrust
in the citezens, but that he might peaceably and quietly with hys
people entre into the cytie, and take possession or thesame. The whiche
hostages were distributed and lodged in the tentes and pauylions of
the Spanyshe armye.
               The third daye of Ianuary, the lorde of Gutterins Cardenes,
greate Master and gouernour of Lyon, of the ordre of sainct Iames,
departed frome the armye, nobly and triumphātly accompanied with
fyue hundred horsemen, and three thousande footemen, towarde the
citie. And as he approched nere to the suburbes, there issued out dyuerse
noble and valiaunt Capitaynes of the Moores, makyng to hym
humble obeysaunce, and conducting him to a palace, adioyning to the
citie, called the palace of Anaxaras, and from thence conueyghed hym to
the palace royall of thesame cytie called Alhābra, wherof he toke quiet
and peacesable possession, to the behoue of y• kinge of Speigne, whome
the Moores promised and confessed to take and obey, as to their kyng
and souereygne. And in signe and token that thei thought in their hartes,
that which they promysed by mouth, they prostrated and humbled
them selues before thesayde great Master, and with dolorous lamentacion
and salt teares, deliuered to him the keyes of thesayd palace. Whē
he had the keyes, &amp; was also possessed of that stronge and magnificent
place, he first of all dispatched the house of all the Moores and paganes,
and appoynted a garrison of valyaunt and noble christiās to kepe
and defende thesame. And thesame daye caused a masse solemply too be
celebrate in a place of thesame palace called Melchita, which done and
finished, he toke possession of all the fortresses. Towres and holdes too
thesayd citie and toune of Granado, belonginge or apperteyning. And
then he caused to be eleuated and exalted vpon the highest to wre of the
palace (where it might best be sene) the signe &amp; token of the crosse, wheron
Christe for vs synners suffred his bitter passiō. At the reysing wherof,
were present an Archebishop, and thre Bishops and other prelates,

whiche deuoutely sange this antheme: Ocrux, aue spes vnica. Thesayde
crosse was .iii. tymes deuoutly eleuate, and at euery exaltacion, ye Moores
beyng within the cytie, roared, howled and cryed, prosternyng them
selfes grouelynge on the grounde, making dolorous noyes and piteful
outcryes. The army encamped without the citye, seynge these thynges,
humbled them selfes mekely before the crosse, rendrynge too almightie
God their moost humble and hartie thankes. The kyng of Spayne,
beyng mounted on horsoacke, perceauynge the ereccion of the crosse,
discended from his Genet, and kneled doune on the bare grounde, and
rendred to God, laude, honour and praysing for that noble and triumphant
victory. And after that the crosse was thus set vppon the high
Towre, the banner of sainct Iames and the kynges banners were pitched
and fixed vpon the turrets and pynacles of the cytie: A Herault
standyng in the top of the high Towre, proclaimed and published these
woordes folowynge.
               
                  Saynct Iames, saynct Iames, saynct Iames, Castil, Castil, Castil,
Granado, Granado, Granado: By hygh and mighty power, lorde Ferdinando
and Elizabeth, kynge and quene of Spayne, haue wonne frō
the Infideles and Moores, the cytie and realme of Granado, through
the helpe of our lorde God and the moost glorious virgyn his mother,
and the verteous apostle saynct Iames, and the holy Father Innocent
the .viii. togethers with the aide &amp; succours of y• great prelates, knyghtes
and other gentlemen borne, &amp; cōmons of their realmes &amp; coūtreys.
               
               When the Herault had finished, the artillary sounded, the mynstrelles
blewe, the people applauded and clapped their handes for gladnes,
that the earth semed to trymble and quake vndreneth them. After thys
ioye ended, there issued out of the citie in maner of procession .vii. hundred,
and mo Christians, aswell men as women and chyldren, whyche
had bene there prysoners and lyued in bondes, seruitude and miserable
capt
                     •••
                  re, wher of the moost parte were naked, wounded and in maner
famyshed for hungre. To whome the kyng of his great liberalite gaue
bothe apparell, vyand and money. These poore prysoners commynge
oute of the cytie sange this Psalme. Benedictus dominus deus Israel,
Quia visitauit &amp; fecit redem prionem plebis sue. Blessed be the lord God
of Israel, which hath visited and redemed his people, and so singynge
foorth the whole Psalme, went to the churche of sainct Feith, which the
kyng Ferdinando had caused to be moost sumpteously edefied during
the tyme of the siege, beynge distant from Granado twoo or three myle.
And as this poore procession passed by the hoost, one espied hys sonne,
and another sawe hys brother, and the sonne perceaued the father, and
the father founde the daughter, whiche were nowe deliuered out of miserable
seruitude and bondage. But they coulde not refrayne nor brydle
them selues from distillynge of teares and sobbynge, seynge theyr
parentes and kynsfolke restored to libertie and fredome. And whē these
people had sayde their Orysons in the churche of saynct Feith, &amp; were

come to the army, they kneling before the kyng kyssed his fote, criynge
with one voyce, God graunt to the kyng of Speygne euerlasting lyfe.
               The next daye after the lord Euerus de Mendosa, Erle of Tediglie
was by the kyng made Capitayn of the house royal, &amp; principal Towre
of the citie of Granado, called Alhambra, hauynge to hym appoynted
and assigned one thousand men of armes, and twoo thousand fotemen.
Unto the whiche Erle, the great Master delyuered the keyes of thesaid
palace and Towre, and other portes and fortresses. On Saturdaye
the .viii. daye of Ianuary, in the yere of our Lorde .M.cccc.xcii. Ferdinand
kyng of Speyne &amp; Granado, the quene &amp; their eldest sonne done
Ihon prince of Speyne, the lord Peter of Mēdosa, archebishop of Toleto,
the patriarche of Alexandry, the Cardinal of Speyne, the lord Peter
Prynce of Lyon, duke of Gaditane, the Marques of Uillena and
Moya. The erle of Capre, the erle of Uinenna of Cifnentes, and many
other Erles, Barones and nobles, whereof some were Englishemen,
whose names I haue not, wih .x. thousand horsemē, and fifty thousand
footemen, wyth greate tryumphe and royaltie entred into the cytye of
Granado, and thereof tooke reall possessiō and season, and caused masse
to be songe in a great place called Meschita, where he caused a solēpne
churche to be buylded in the honoure of God and hys mother. Whē
Masse was ended, the kynge and quene repayred to the palace royall
of Alhambra, the whiche was wonderfull, bothe in quantite and sumpteous
buyldynge, whyche house was adourned with ryche Arras and
Tapestry in euery chambre. The Erle of Tendiglie Capitaine of
the palace, feasted the kynge and Quene, and all the nobilitie at hys
awne costes and charges. So the kynge of Speygne there remayned
tyll the countrey was reduced too a good confromytye and ordre,
and dyuerse Castelles and fortresses were made for the sauegarde and
tuycion of the realme. And because thys victory obteyned, was to the
glory of God, and to the publique wealth of all Christianite, thesayde
Cardinall of Caunterbury▪ declared to▪ the people that the kyng had
sent hym and the other nobles thether that daye, not onely to notefye
and declare to them the verite of the fact, but also to exhorte thē to geue
laudes and praysinges to almighty God, for deliuering so goodly a cytye,
so plentiful a countrey, &amp; so notable a regiō out of the hades of his
enemies &amp; persecutours of his faith &amp; religiō. Which declaraciō ended
the Archebishop with the clergie, the nobles with ye cōminaltie in moost
deuout maner wēt in general processiō, rēdring to God for this greate
acheued enterprice, glory, honour &amp; moost reuerēt &amp; harty thankes.
               Aboute this ceason, Maximilian kyng of Romanes hauyng the vpper
hāde of the Fleminges, by aide of the kyng of Englād (as you haue
hearde before) entended to reuēge him self of ye Frēch king, for y• he had
repudiate his daughter lady Margaret, &amp; sent her home to him, entēdīg
as he thought to take to his wife ye lady Anne of Briteyn. But because
he was not of sufficiēt habilite of him self to susteyne &amp; furnish y• warre,

he determined to desyre kyng Henry to take parte with hym. Whereupon
he sent Iames Contibald Ambassadoure, a man of great grauitie
to exhorte and requyre the kyng of England, to entre his company
and societee in armes, faythfully promising on hys honoure y• he would
in sembleable matters of his, take parte with .x, M. men at the least, for
the space of .ii. yeres whensoeuer he should requyre hym. And because it
is his chaunce to trye the fortune of battaile and to intimate the warre,
he promised to certefie kyng Henry .vi. monethes before that he would
inuade or occupie the territory of hys enemies. And by this message,
Maximilian greatly inflamed and set a fyer kyng Hēryes hart to beare
with him. And as he was mynded before this time as you haue hard
before, to aide and assist the Britones in the extremetie of their perill,
he now reconed y• time to be come, that he must collect an army to helpe
them now at a pynche in their moost perell and daungier, to thentēt to
restore agayne the Britishe nacion to their auncient libertie, and to expulse
the Frenche nacion, which thrusted for the blood, death and destruccion
of the poore Brytones, clerely out of that duchy and country.
And he was the more ardently therunto encouraged, because he perceaued
Maximilian him selfe so earnestly set and bent toward that enterprice,
and therfore he made this aunswere to Iames the Ambassadour,
y• he woulde be ashamed to be foūde slacke or vnprouided at any tyme
of Maximilian his felow &amp; compaigniō in armes. And so these matters
well brought to effect on both parties, the kyng dimissed the Ambassadoure
from hys presence.
            
            
               The .vii. yere.
               
                  IN thys very ceason Charles the Frēch kyng, receaued lady
Anne as his pupille into his hādes, &amp; with great solempnite
her espoused, hauing with her for her dower the whole countrey
of Briteyne. And so by this meane the Brytones became
subiect to the French kyng. Maximiliā beyng certefied of this, fell into
a great rage and agony, for y• he was not cōtent with the forsaking and
refusing of his daughter lady Margaret, but also had takē &amp; rauished
away from hym his assured wife lady Anne duches of Britayne. And
calling vpon God for vengeaunce &amp; ponishmēt for such an heynous &amp;
execrable facte, cryed out &amp; rayled on hym, wishynge him a thousande
deathes. Yet after that he was pacefied, and came to hym selfe agayne,
and had gathered hys wyttes together, he thought it was moost expedient
to vindicate and reuenge hys honour and dignitee so manifestly
touched, with the dynt of sworde. And beyng in this mynde, sent certain
Ambassadours to kyng Henry with hys lettres, desyringe him with all
diligence to prepare an army, and he hym selfe woulde do likewise, to
inuade the French kynges realmes with fyer, swoord and blood.
               Kynge Henry hearyng of this, and putting no diffidence in the promes
of Maximilian, whome he knew to haue a deadly hatred and lōge
grudge agaynst the French kyng, caused a muster to be made in all the

partes of hys realme, and put hys men of warre in a redynes armed &amp;
weaponed accordyng to their feates: beside this he rygged, māned and
vyteiled his nauy ready to set forward euery houre, and sent curryers
into euery shyre to accelerate, and hast the souldiours to the sea side.
               After the message was declared, there came without any delai an houge
army of men, aswell of the lowe sorte and commonaltie as other noble
men, harnyssed and armed to battaile, partely glad to helpe their prīce
and to do him seruice, and partely to buckle with the Frenchmen, with
whome the Englishmen very willingly desyre to cope and fight in opē
battaill. And immediately, as monicion was geuen, euery man with hys
bande of souldioures repayred to London.
               After that, all this army was arrayed and euen readie to set forward
wherof were cheuetaynes and leaders. Iasper duke of Bedford, &amp; Ihō
erle of Oxforde beside other, the kynge sent Christopher Urswike hys
aulmoner, and syr Ihon Ryseley knight to Maximiliā, to certefie him
that the kyng was all in a redines, and woulde shortely arryue in the
continent land, assone as he were aduertised that Maximilian and hys
men, were ready and prepared to ioyne with hym. The Ambassadours
sayled into Flaunders, and after their message done, they sent .ii. letters
in all hast to kyng Henry, the whiche not onely sore vnquyeted &amp; vexed
hym, but also caused him to take more thought, care and study on hym
then he did before: for they declared that no prynce coulde be more vnprouyded
or more destitute of men and armure, no more lackynge all
thynges, apperteignynge to warre, then was Maximilian, and that he
laye lurkyng in a corner, sore sicke of the fluxe of ye pursse, so that he had
neyther men, horses, municions, armure nor money, neuerthelesse his
mynd &amp; will was good, if his power and habilitee had been correspōdēt
&amp; therfore there was no trust to be put in his aide or puissaunce. Their
letters bothe appalled, and made sorowfull the kyng of Englād, which
like a prudent prynce did well consider &amp; ponder, y• it were both ieopardous
and costly, for him alone to enterprice so great a warre. And on y•
other parte, if he should desist and leaue of his pretensed purpose, all mē
might call hym cowarde and recreant prynce. Beside this, he thoughte
that his awne nacion woulde not take his tariyng at home in good nor
fauourable parte, cōsideryng ye syth they had geuen so large money for
the preparaciō of all thinges necessary and conueniēt for thesame, they
might conceaue in their heddes &amp; ymagen, that vnder coloure &amp; pretēce
of a dissimuled warre, he had exacted of thē notable summes of money,
&amp; now the treasure was once payed, then ye warre was done, &amp; his cofers
well enryched, &amp; the commōs enpouerisshed. So that at thys tyme he
doubted &amp; cast perels on euery side &amp; parte, &amp; beside this, he was not a
litle sory y• Maximiliā authour of this warre did absent him selfe, &amp; defraude
him of his societe &amp; assistēce. And while he studied &amp; mused what
counsaill he shoulde best take in suche a doubtfull and sodeyne case, he
like a graue prynce, remembring the saiyng of the wiseman, woorke by

counsayll &amp; thou shalt not repēt the, assembled together all his lordes
and other of hys priuate counsayl, by whose myndes it was concluded
and determined, that he shoulde manfully and couragiously perceauer
and procede in thys broched and begonne enterprice, recordynge well
with them selfes, and affirming playnely that all cheualry and marsial
prowesses, the more di
                     ••
                  icile and heard that it is to attayne to, the more
renoumed is the glory, and the fame more immortall of the vanquisher
and obteyner. Therfore by this counsayl of his frendes and senate, he
made Proclamacion that euery man should set forward into Fraunce,
and yet not openynge howe Iudas
                     •
                  y Maximilian had deceaued hym,
least that they knowynge the whole fact, shoulde not be so courageous
to go towarde that battaile and procede forward on their iorney. And
therfore to prouide and forse all perels and daungiers that might accidently
ensue, he so strengthened, multiplied and augmented his army
in such numbre before he toke ship, that he with his awne powre might
discourage and ouercome the whole puissaūce of his aduersaries.
               When he had thus gathered and assembled his armye, he sayled to
Caleys the .vi. daye of October, &amp; there encāped him selfe, tariyng there
a certaine space to se his men harnessed &amp; appareled, that neither weapō
nor any engyne necessary for his iourney should be neglected. At which
place all the army had knowlege by the Ambassadours, whiche were
newly returned out of Flaunders (for they did not knowe of it before) y•
Maximilian coulde make no preparaciō for lacke of money, &amp; therfore
there was no succour to be exspected at hys hand. At the which report, y•
Englishmen were nothing abashed nor dismayed, trusting so muche to
their awne puissaūce &amp; cōpany: but yet they meruayled and wondered
greatly y• heard it related, y• Maximilian receauyng such great vilany
not lōge before at the hand of kyng Charles, was not present to pricke
them forward, to crye &amp; call, to moue and excite the Englishmen, ye and
if he had had .vi. hundred bodyes to put them all in hasard, rather then
to leaue the Englishmē, now setting vpon his dayly enemyes &amp; deadly
aduersaries. Albeit Maximiliā lacked no hart &amp; good will to be reuenged,
yet he lacked substaūce to cōtinew warre, for he could neither haue
money nor men of the dronkē Fleminges, nor yet of the crakyng Brabanders,
so vngrate people were they to their souereigne lorde
               In the meane ceason, although the Frenche kynge was as well with
courage replenished as with men furnished mete to trye a battaile, yet
al this notwithstāding he made semblaūce, asthough he desired nothīg
more then peace, beyng not ignorāt that peace to be obteined was of no
smal valure &amp; price, &amp; yet he determined to make more expēce in getting
of peace, then in settinge foorth of warre and hostilitee, and regarded
so muche the lesse the treasure too be dispensed for the acquyrynge of
vnitee and concord, for asmuche as he was afrayed that he beyng diligent
to resist the inuasion of the Englishmen, that the Britones wherof
the moost parte bare the yoke of his subiecciō contrary to their hartes

and myndes, woulde sodeynly rebell and set them selfes at libertie, and
plucke out their heddes out of hys colour, and set vp another duke &amp;
gouernour. And at thesame very tyme he was inuited and desired of
Lewes Sforcia duke of Millayn, to warre agaynst Ferdinand kynge
of Napels, at whose desyre he was prest and ioyous, thinkynge that he
had that occasion sent to hym from God, for the which he longe before
thristed &amp; sore wished. The whiche kyngdome he pretended to be dewe
to hym by succession, and entended long before to acquyre and cōquere
it by force of armes, as hys very right and inheritaūce. For when Rene
duke of Angeou last kyng of Scicile, departed without any heire male
of hys wyfe lawfully begotten, he did adopt to his heyre of all his realmes
&amp; dominiōs, Lewes the .xi. father to y• .iii. kyng Charles, to thentēt
that he should deliuer quene Margaret his daughter, out of the hādes
of kyng Edward the .iii. as you haue wel before perceaued, wrōgfully
and without cause disheneriting hys cosyn, Godsonne, and heyre, Rene
duke of Lorayne &amp; Barre. For the which cause he did the more busily
procure &amp; labour for y• amitie, fauor &amp; frēdship of his neighbours roūd
about hym, y• whē al thīges were appeased &amp; set in good slaye at home
he might the better employe his whole force &amp; puissaūce on his warre in
Italy. Wherfore beyng much desirous to haue all thinges pacefied &amp;
set in a perfite cōcorde and securitee, he sent Philip Creueceur lord Cordes
his chiefe counsailer and diligēt officer to entreate, moue and persuade
the kyng of Englande to be reconciled &amp; made agayne as a new
frende to the French kyng. He not forgetting his message, sent letters to
kyng Henry before he passed the sea, &amp; arriued in the ferme land, by the
which he notefied to hym, yt he of his boūdē duetie &amp; obseruaūce, which
he ought to the kyng hys master, &amp; to the proffite of his realme, woulde
take payne to inuent &amp; excogitate some mean &amp; waye, y• his highnes &amp;
kyng Charles his master beyng disseuered in amitie, &amp; made exstreme
enemyes, onely for the the cause of Maximilian newly elected kynge of
Romanes, should be reducted &amp; brought agaī into their pristyne estate
&amp; consuete familiaritee, doubting not to bring his ship to the porte desired,
if it might stand with his pleasure to sende some of his coūsailers
to the confynes &amp; borders of the English pale, adioyninge to Fraunce,
there to here what reasonable offres should be demonstrated and proffered:
whiche condicions of peace should be so reasonable and so ample
that he doubted not, but that he might with hys great honoure breake
vp hys campe, and retire hys army backe agayne into hys owne seignory
and dominion.
               The kynge of Englande, maturely consideryng that Britayne was
clerely lost▪ and in maner irrecuperable, beynge nowe adioyned too the
croune of Fraunce by mariage, whyche duchy hys whole mynde was
to defende, protect and conferme, and that Maximilian what for lacke
of money, and what for mistrust that he had in hys awne subiectes,
laye styll lyke a dormouse nothynge doynge, perceauynge also that it

should be bothe to hys people profitable, and to hym greate honour to
determyn this great warre without losse or bloodshed, appoynted for
commissioners the bishop of Exceter, &amp; Gyles lord Dawbeney to passe
the seas to Caleys, to cōmen with the lorde Cordes of articles of peace
to be agreed vpon and concluded.
               When the commissioners were once met, they so ingeniously and effecteously
proceded in their great affaires, that they agreed that an amytie
and peace should be assented to and concluded, so that the condicions
of the league should be egall, indifferent and acceptable to bothe
partes as after shalbe declared.
               While the commissioners were thus consultinge on the marches of
Fraunce, the kynge of Englande as you haue heard, was arryued at
Caleys, where he prepared all thinges necessary for such a iorney. And
from thence he remoued in .iiii. battailes,Boleyn beseged. nere to the toune of Boleyne,
and there pytched hys tentes before the toune, in a place propice and cō
                  ueniēt
and determined to geue a great assaute to the toune. In y• which
fortresse was suche a garrison of Warlike souldiours, that valiauntly
defended the toune, and thesame so replenyshed with artillary and municious
of warre, that the losse of the Englishmen assautyng the toune,
should be greater dammage to the realme of England, then the cōqueryng
and gaynyng of thesame should be emolument or proffite. Howbeit
the kynges daily shot, rased &amp; defaced the walles of thesaide toune:
but when euery man was prest and ready to geue the assaute, a sodeyne
rumoure roase in the army, that a peace was by the commissioners taken
and concluded, whiche brute as it was pleasaunt and mellifluous
to the Frēchmē, so it was to the English naciō bitter, sowre &amp; dolorous
because they were prest and ready at all tymes to set on their enemyes,
and refused neuer to attempt any enterprice, whiche might seme either
to be for their laude or profyt: thei were in great fumes, angry and euel
content, rayling and murmuringe emongest them selfes, that the occasion
of so glorious a victory to them manifestly offred, was by certayn
condicions to no man, nor yet to the kyng commodious or profitable,
refused, putte by and shamefully slacked: But aboue all other, dyuerse
lordes and capitaynes, encoraged with desyre of fame &amp; honour,
trustyng in this iourney to haue wonne their spurres, whiche for to set
them selfes and their band the more gorgeously forward had mutuate,
and borowed dyuerse and sondry summes of money, and for the repayment
of thesame, had morgaged and impignorate their landes &amp; possessions,
sore grudged and lamented this sodeyne peace, and returne of
them vnthought of, and spake largely agaynste the kynges doynges,
saiynge and affirmyng, that he as a man fearyng and dreading y• force
and puissaunce of his enemyes, had concluded an inconuenient peace
without cause or reason: But the kynge as a wise man and moost prudent
prynce to assuage the indignacion and pacefie the murmoure of y•
people, declared what dammage and detryment, what losse &amp; perdiciō
                  
of many noble Capitaynes and stronge souldiours must of necessitee
happen and ensue at the assaute of a toune, and especially when it is soo
well fortefied with men and municious, as the toune of Boleyn at that
present tyme was: protestyng farther, that he might be iustly accused &amp;
condempned of iniquite &amp; vntruthe, except he did preferre the sauegard
of their lyues, before hys awne wealth, health and aduauntage.
               When he had thus prudently cōsolate and appeased the myndes of
hys mē of warre, he returned backe again wt his whole army, to ye toun
of Caleys, where he beganne to smell certayn secret smoke, whiche was
lyke to turne to a great flame, without it were well watched and polletiquely
sene to. For by the craftie inuencion and deuelishe ymaginaciō
of that pesteferus serpent lady Margaret, duches of Burgoyne, a new
ydoll was set vp in Flaunders, and called Richard Plantagenet, secōd
sonne to kyng Edward the .iiii. as though he had bene resulcitate from
death to lyfe, whiche sodeyne newes more stacke and fretted in his stomack,
then the battaile which now was, set late forward &amp; more payne
he had (not without great ieopardie of hym selfe) to appeache &amp; quēche
this newe spronge conspiracy, then in makynge peace with the Frenche
kyng his enemy. And so he was content to accept and receaue (and not
to offre and geue) the honest condicions of peace of his enemy proffred
and oblated, except he woulde at one tyme make warre, bothe at home
in his owne countrey, and also in foreyne and externe nacions. Wherfore
kynge Henry forseynge all these thinges before (and not without
great counsayll) concluded with the French kyng, to thentēt that he beyng
deliuered of al outward enuytie mighte the more quickly prouide
for the ciuyle and domestical cōmocions, which he perceaued wel to be
buddyng out. The conclusion of the peace was thus, y• the peace should
continue bothe their lyues, and that the Frenche kynge shoulde paye to
kynge Henry a certayne summe of money in hand, accordyng as the cō
                  missioners
shoulde appoynt for his charges susteyned in his iourney:
               Whiche (as the kynge certefied the Mayre of London by hys letters
the .ix. daye of Nouembre) amounted to the summe of .vii.C.xlv.M.
ducates, whiche is in sterlynge money .i.C.lxxxvi.M.ii.C.l.l, and
also should yerely for a certayne space paye or cause to be paide for the
money that the kynge of England had sent and exspended in the tuyciō
&amp; aide of the Britones .xxv.M. crounes, which yerely tribute, y• Frēch
kynge afterwarde vexed and troubled with the warres of Italy, ye
rely satisfied, contented and payde, euen to the tyme of hys sonne kynge
Henry the .viii. to thentent to pay the whole duetie and tribute, and for
the further cōseruacion and stablishyng of the league &amp; amitie betwene
bothe the realmes.
               Shortely after that kyng Henry had taryed a conuenient space, he
transfreted and arryued at Douer, and so came to his maner of Grenewiche.
And this was the yere of our lorde a .M.CCCC.xciii. and ye .vii.
yere of his troubleous reigne. Also in this soiournynge and besegynge

of Boleyne (whiche we spake of before) there was fewe or none kylled,
sauyng onely Ihon Sauage knyght, which goyng preuely out of hys
pauylion with syr Ihon Riseley, roade about the walles to viewe and
se their strength, was sodeynly intercepted and taken of hys enemies.
               And he beyng inflamed with yre, although he were captyue, of hys high
courage disdeyned to be taken of suche vileynes, defended his life to y•
vttermost and was manfully (I will not saye wilfully) slayne and oppressed,
albeit syr Ihon Riseley fled frō theim &amp; escaped their daunger.
               When kynge Henry was returned into England, he first of all thinges
elected into the societe of saynct George, vulgarely called the order
of the garter, Alphōse duke of Calabres sonne, accordyng to his desire
whiche Alphonse was sonne and heyre to Ferdinand kyng of Napels,
&amp; after kyng of thesame realme, til he was ouercome by kyng Charles.
And after, the kyng sent Christopher Ursewike, Ambassadour wyth y•
gartier, coller, mantell, and other habiliamentes apperteyninge to the
companyons of thesayde noble ordre. Which Ambassadoure arryuing
at Napels, deliuered to the duke the whole habite, with all the ceremonies
and dewe circumstaunces therunto belonging. Whiche duke very
reuerently receaued it, and with more reuerence reuested him selfe wt
thesame in a solempne presence, thinkyng that by this apparell and inuestiture,
he was made a frende and compaygnion in ordre with y• king
of England, whose frendship obteyned, he feared nothing the assautes
or inuasions of hys enemies. And this was the cause that he desyred so
muche to be compaygnion of that noble order, fermely beleuyng that y•
kyng of England souereygne of that ordre, should be aider and mainteyner
of hym agaynst the Frenche kyng, whome he knew woulde passe
the moūtaynes and make warre on hym. But this custome of assistēce
in ordres was, eyther neuer begonne, or before clerely abholished: For
in oure tyme there haue bene many noble men of Italy, compaigniōs
as well of the golden Flese in Burgoyne, as of the ordre of sainct Mighel
in Fraunce, that haue bene banyshed and profligate from their naturall
countrey, and yet haue not bene aided by the souereygne nor cō
                  panyons
of thesame order. For surely the statutes and ordinaunces of
all thesayde orders dothe not oblige and bynde them to that case, but in
certayne poyntes. After this the duke dimissed the Ambassadour, rewardyng
hym moost pryncely.
               Shortely after thys Charles, the Frenche kyng concluded a league
with Ferdinand kyng of Spayne, and also beyng entreated and solicited
with the Oratoures of diuerse princes, which persuaded and mollefied
the stony hart of a frosen prince, caused him to come to communicacion
and treatie with Maximilian kyng of Romanes, and to cōclude
a peace with hym for a season, to the entēt that he might without disturbaunce
of hys neyghboures adioyninge, prosperously &amp; safely make
warre on Ferdynand kyng of Napels, &amp; on all Italy, as he before had
mynded and excogitated.
               
                  
And so Charles, beyng furnished with men, of armes, horsemen, fotemen,
nauye, and aide of some Italians, passed through Italy by Rome
and without any great laboure wanne the citie of Napels. When he
had obteyned his victory: in hys returne beynge assailed with the Uenicians
at the toune of Fornouoe, he had a great daungerous victory.
And so lyke a conquerour, with great triūphe returned into his realme
and countrey. After hym Lewes the .xii. beyng kynge, when he founde
oportunitee and sawe the gappe open, inuaded the Italians agayne, &amp;
recouered agayn the realme of Napels, whiche Frederyck the sonne of
kyng Alphonse, not longe before had gotten from the French nacion: &amp;
after that he subdued and conquered the whole duchy of Millayn. Albei
                     ••
                  
                  
                     •
                  ot long after (fortune turnynge her whele) he lost bothe the kyngdome
of Napels, and the fayre citie and duchy of Millayne both together.
And so the Frenchmen warrynge vpon the Italians had no better
successe in their cōquestes, then their parentes and predecessours heretofore
haue ben accustomed. For vndoubtedly, as many places as thei
vexed and sacked with murder and spoylinge, so many or more in conclusion
they did enoble and decorate with their blood and slaughter.
Which small recompēce little profited and lesse releued, such as before
were robbed and spoyled of all their goodes, substaunce and ryches.
               After thys the Spanyardes arryued in Italy, and their puttynge too
flighte the Frenchemen, obteyned the possession of the realmes of Napels
and Scicile, the which they possesse and enioye at this houre. And
at length a certayne nacion of Germany, called the Swytsers, called to
be partakers of the spoyle of Italy, wāne certayn tounes there, which
they possesse and enioye at this present tyme.
               In this warre and tumulteous busynes in Italy, which was y• most
terrible and sorest plague, that any man can remembre of that nacion,
there was no person, no place, no priuate house, no noble familye, no
capitayne or prynce, but he was oppressed either with the heapes of the
dead carcasses, or with the bloud of hys frendes or subiectes, or els suffred
some affliccion Iniurie or detryment. And insome wise at one tyme
or another, euery man did tast and suffre all the mischeues that apperteyned
to the victory gotten by their enemyes. The which defacynge &amp;
blottyng of the beutye of that countrey, sometyme called the quene of y•
earth, and floure of the worlde, chaunced not of her awne selfe or her
awne cause or desert, but the Italians her awne suckyng chyldren opened
the gappe, and made the waye of her destruccion. For at that tyme
thus it chaunced, that when the potētates and seignories of Italy perceaued,
that all thinge vnder them succeded, euen as they woulde desire
and wishe, to their great exultacion and reioysinge: by reason whereof
they sate still at home lyke sloggardes (as women be accustomed to do)
skoldynge and brawlyng, exercisyng and practisyng preuy displeasure
and malice, not agayn their enemyes as they were accustomed, but emong
them selfes one against another, castinge out of memory &amp; drownynge

their auncient renoune, glory and honoure with desyre of rule
and appetite to be reuenged, and so destroyed the common weale, and
subue
                     •
                  ted the olde monumentes and actes of their forfathers and predecessors.
And because some of them, thinkynge them selfes, not of force
and puissaūce sufficient inough to bring their purpose to effect, and to
reuenge their quarell, they entysed, stirred and procured with giftes, rewardes
and promyses, straungers and foreyne nacions to their aide
and assistence. The other seynge them so desirous to haue their helpe,
partely moued with their giftes, partely with desyre of rule, spoyles &amp;
prayes, gathered together a great company and entred into Italy, and
there distroyed, spoyled and possessed the better parte of it. And so the
Italians, as men out of their wit, where as they thought one to noye &amp;
hurte another with hatefull warryng, they destroyed their natyue coū
                  trey,
beynge of nature enclosed and mu
                     •
                  yte with hygh hilles, and the
mayne sea rounde aboute, and opened the waye to straungiers to their
vttre ignominy and finall destruccion, which thei might haue kept out
of all daunger, if they had bene their awne frēdes, and loued their awne
wealth and commodite. Therfore I maye saye: O progeny, aswell wicked
as vngodly, hath discorde and dissencion pleased the so much that
thou wouldest vtterly extinguishe and confoūde the glory and honour
or thy natiue countrey? And in conclusion, thou thy selfe art come to the
depest pyt of wretchednes, because that thou perceauing the ruyne that
thou hast caused and procured, thou arte more repentaunte for the begynninge
of it▪ then glad to desist and leaue it, and so accordynge to thy
desert, thou hast thy penaunce and guardon. The grand capitayne and
beginner of thys mischief was Sforcia, whiche at that tyme ruled at

                     •
                  ys will the duchy of Millayne vndre duke Ihon Galeas his nephew:
but for a truthe this Lewes ruled al, and the duke did nothing. Wherfore
Alphons duke of Calabre, and after kyng of Napels, grudgynge
that this duke Ihon his sonne in lawe, should be de
                     •
                  rauded of his superiorite
and dominiō, threatened sore this Lewes Sforcia. Where he
fearyng to be put from his authoritee, solicited and by great entreatie
procured Charles the French kyng▪ to inuade the realme of Napels.
               By reason of whiche procurement, Alphonse duke of Calabre, whiche
succeded his father Ferdinand in the kingdome of Napels (which also
as you haue heard, was made knight 
                     •
                  f the garter) was first depryued
of his kingdome by thesaide kynge Charles, and shortely after of his
lyfe. But Lewes Sforce had no longe ioye after the deathe of hys
ennemy, for he was betrayed and taken by the Swytzers, whiche warred
vnder kynge Lewes the twelfth, then beynge Frenche kynge, and
caryed into Fraunce, where he in the Castell of Lothes miserably finished
hys lyfe, accordynge to the saiynge of the Gospell, woo be too
hym by whome a slaundre begynneth. Thys mischiefe beganne
at that tyme when Charles came thether, and contynueth yet,

which is the yere of oure Lord .M.D.xliii. for an example to other, y•
straungers inuited to a prosperous countrey be lothe to departe from
the swete sauoure once therof tasted.
               This yere was borne at Grenewiche lord Henry, seconde sonne to y•
kyng, whiche was created duke of Yorke, and after prynce of Wales,
and in conclusion succeded his father in croune and dignitee. Nowe let
vs returne to the newe founde sonne of kynge Edwarde, coniured by
mennes policies from death to lyfe.
               And first to declare hys lignage and beginning, you must vnderstād
that the duches of Burgoyne so norished and broughte vp in the sedicious
and scelerate faccions of false contryuers &amp; founders of discorde
coulde neuer cease nor be in quyet (lyke a vyper that is ready to burste
with superfluyte of poyson) except he should infest and vnquyet y• king
of England, for no desert or displeasure by hym to her committed, but
onely because he was propagate and descēded of the house of Lācastre,
euer beyng aduerse &amp; enemy to her lyne &amp; lynage. For which only cause
she compassed, ymagened and inuented how to cast a scorpiō in his bosome,
and to infect his whole realme with a pesliferous discorde. To
thentent that he beyng vanquyshed and brought to confusion, both the
boylynge heate of her malicious harte mighte be fully saciated with
hys innocent bloude, and also auaūce and preferre some darlyng of her
faccion to his Empire, rule and dignitee. And principally remembring
taht the erle of Lyncoln, which was by her set foorth and al his cōpany
had small fortune &amp; worsse successe in their progression and enterprice,
contrary to her hope and expectacion, she lyke a dogge reuertynge to
her olde vomyte, beganne to deuyse &amp; spynne a new webbe, lyke a spyder
that dayly weueth when hys calle is torne. And as the deuell prouydeth
venemous sauce to corrupt banckettes, so for her purpose she
espyed a certayne younge man, of visage beutiful, of countenaunce demure,
of wit subtile crafty and pregnaūt, called Peter Warbecke. And
for his dastard cowardnes of the Englishmen, in derision called Perkyn
Warbeck, accordyng to the duche phrase, whiche chaūge the name
of Peter to Perkyn, to yōgelinges of no strength nor courage for their
timerous hartes and pusillanimitee: Whiche younge man traueylyng
many countreys, coulde speake English and many other languages, &amp;
for his basenes of stocke and birthe was knowen of none almoost, and
only for the gayne of hys lyuyng from his childehoode was of necessitee,
compelled to seke and frequēt dyuerse realmes and regions. Therfore
the duches thinkyng to haue gotten God by the foote, whē she had
the deuell by the tayle, &amp; adiudging this yoūg man to be a mete organe
to conuey her purpose, and one not vnlike to be ye duke of Yorke, sonne
to her brother kyng Edward, whiche was called Richarde, kept hym a
certayne space with her preuely, and hym with such diligēce instructed,
bothe of the secretes and common affaires of the realme of England, &amp;
of the lignage, dissent and ordre of the house of Yorke, that he like a

good scholer not forgettyng his lesson coulde tell all that was taught
him promptly without any difficultie or signe of any subornacion: and
besides, he kept such a pryncely countenaunce, and so coūtrefeare a ma

                  stie
royall, that all men in maner did fermely beleue that he was extracted
of the noble house and familie of the dukes of Yorke. For surely
it was a gift geuen to that noble progeny as of nature in the roote plated
that all the sequele of that lyne and stock did study and deuyse how
to be equyualent in honoure and fame with their forefathers and noble
predecessors.
               When this diabolicall duches had framed her cloth mete for ye market,
and ymagened that all thinges was ready and prepared for the cō

lesse mynded then peace and tranquilite, and nothing more desired then
dissencion ciuile warre and destruccion of kyng Henry. Wherefore she
sent Perkyn Werbeck, her new inuented Mawmet first into Portyngall,
and so craftely into the realme of Ireland, to thentent that he beynge
bothe witty and wilye might moue, inuegle and prouoke the rude
and rusticall Irishenacion (beyng more of nature enclyned to rebellion
then to reasonable ordre) to a new conflict and a sedicious commocion.
This worshipfull Perkyn, arriuyng in Ireland, whether it were more
by hys crafty witte, or by the malicious and beastly exhortacion of the
saluage Irish gouernours, within short space entred so farre into their
fauoures, and so seriously perswaded and allured them to his purpose,
that the greatest lordes and prynces of the coūtry, adhibited such faith
and credite to his woordes, as that thing had bene true indede, whiche
he vntruly with false demonstracions setfoorth and diuulged. And as
though he had bene the very sonne of kynge Edwarde, they honoured,
exalted and applauded hym with all reuerence and dewe honoure, promisyng
to hym aide, comforte and assistence of all thinges to the feat of
warre, necessary and apperteynyng.
               In the meane 
                     •
                  eason these newes were related to Charles the Frēch
kyng, then beyng in displeasure with kyng Henry, which without delay
sent for Perkyn into Irelande, to the entent to sende hym agaynste like
kynge of England, whiche was inuadyng Fraūce (as you before haue
heard) This Flemyng Perkyn was not a litle ioyfull of thys message,
thinkinge by this onely request to be exalted into heauen, when he was
called to the familiarite and acquayntaunce of kynges and prynces: &amp;
so with all diligence sayled into Fraunce, with a very small nauy, not
so small as smally furnished. And commynge to the kynges presence
was of hym royally accepted, and after a princely fassion entreteyned, &amp;
had a garde to him assigned, wherof was gouernour y• lord Cōgreshal.

And to hym at Parys resorted syr George Neuell bastard, Syr Ihon
Tayler, Rouland Robynson and an hundred Englishe rebelles. But
after that a peace, as before is sayde was appointed and concluded betwixt
him and the kynge of England, thesayde kynge Charles dismissed
the younge man, and woulde no l
                     •
                  nger kepe hym. But some men
saye whiche were there attendynge on hym, that he fearynge that kyng
Charles, woulde deliuer hym to the kynge of Englande, beguyled the
lorde Congreshall, and fledde awaye from Parys by nyght. But whether
he departed without the Frenche kynges consent or disassent, he
deceaued in his expectacion, and in maner in despayre, returned agayn
to the lady Margaret his first foolishe foundacion.
               The duches thinkynge euery houre from his departure a whole
yere, vntill suche tyme she heard from hym, and effecteously desiring to
knowe whiche waye lady Fortune turned her whele, herynge hym to
be repudiate and abiected oute of the Frenche courte, was in a greate
agony and muche amased and more appalled: But when she was
asserteyned of hys arryuall in Flaunders, she no lesse reuiued, then he
that hathe in steade of the sworde of execucion, a perdon and restauracion
of hys lyfe and degree to hym delyuered and shewed. And at
hys commynge to her presence, she receaued hym wyth suche gladnes,
with suche reioysyng and suche comforte (as in dede she coulde dissemble
alone aboue all other) as though she had neuer sene nor knowē him
before, or as he were newly cropen oute of hys mothers lappe agayne,
that what in trust to preferre hym to the prehemynence by her ymagened,
and what for the hope that she had to destroye kynge Henry, she
fell into suche an vnmeasurable ioye, that she had almost lost her wytte
and senses. And that thys her gladnes might be notified and made
apparaunt to euery man, she first reioyced of her nephewes health and
welfare: And secondarely she much thrusted and sore longed, not once,
but dyuerse and sundry tymes in open audience, and in solempne presence
to here hym declare and shewe by what meanes he was preserued
from deathe and destruccion, and in what countreys he had wandered
and soughte frendshippe: And finally, by what chaunce of fortune
he came to her courte and presence. To the entent that by the
open declaracion of these feyned phantasies, the people myghte be persuaded
to geue credite and belefe, that he was the true begotten sonne
of her brother kynge Edwarde. And after thys she assigned hym a
garde of thirty persones in Murrey and blewe, and highly honoured
hym as a great estate and called hym the whyte Rose, prynce of Englande.
               By reason whereof, the nobilite of Flaunders were to hym diligent,
&amp; with dewe reuerence dyd him all the pleasure that laye in their powre
or officies. And to be shorte, the more that thys poeticall and feyned inuencion
was shadowed with the pretence of sincere veritie, the more
faythe and vndubitate credence, was adhibited to it. In so muche that

many one thought hym to be preserued, onely by the will and mightie
powre of almightie God, and to be conueyghed at the fyrste daungier
by some faythfull frende of kyng Edward his father into some straūge
country, and so escaped the violēt tyranny of hys vncle kyng Rychard,
whiche vndubitately hereafter should recouer his fathers possessions
&amp; kingdome. The fame &amp; bruyte of this iuggled myracle was almoost
in one momēt blowē ouer all the coūtry of Flaūders, &amp; the territories
therabouts. But in England it was blased in euery place soner then a
man could thinke or deuise it: In which coūtrey more then in other places
it was receaued for an infallible veritie &amp; moost sure truthe, &amp; that
not onely of the cōmon people, but also of diuerse noble &amp; worshipfull
men, of no small estimaciō, which sware &amp; affirmed it to be true, and no
coment or fable phantastically ymagened. After this deuulgaciō y• Rychard
sonne to kyng Edward was yet liuyng, &amp; had in great honour emongest
the Flēminges, there began sedicion to springe on euery syde,
none otherwise then in ye pleasaūt time of vere, trees are wōte to budde
or blossome. For not onely they y• were in sanctuaryes, for great &amp; heynous
offences by them committed, but also many other y• were fallē in
debte, and doubtyng to be brought to captiuitie &amp; bondage, assembled
together in a cōpany, and were passed ouer the sea into Flaunders to

                  cate Richard sonne to kynge Edwarde, otherwise named
Perkyn Warbeke. After this many of the noble mē conspired together
some through rashnes &amp; temerite induced therunto, some beyng so earnestly
perswaded in their awn cōceipt, as though they knew perfightly
that this Perkyn was y• vndubitate sonne of king Edward the .iiij. solicited,
sturred &amp; allured to their opinion al such as were frēdes &amp; fau

Other whome it greued and vexed too see the worlde stande still in

some chaunge, ranne hedlinge into that fury, madnes and sedicious cō
                  iuracion.
               This rumour and vayne fable of this twise borne duke Richard, deuyded
all Englād and brewe the realme into Partakynges &amp; seuerall
faccions, so that the myndes of all men were vexed either with hope of
gayne and preferment, or with feare of losse and confusion. For no man
was quyet in his awne mynde, but his braynes &amp; senses daily laboured
&amp; bet about this great &amp; weightie matter, euery man according to their
intelligēce, pōdering &amp; weiyng in egal balaūce, the incōmoditie &amp; daungier
that might hereof ensue, and the gayne &amp; commoditie that by thesame
might be obteyned &amp; gottē. Albeit the kyng, &amp; hys coūsayl &amp; other
hys faythfull frendes, not a litle mer
                     •
                  ayled that any person (beynge in
hys ryght wyt) coulde induce in hys mynde or fynde in hys hart falsely
to thynke and fraudulentlye too ymagen, suche a pernicious fable

and ficcion, beyng not onely straūge and marueylous, but also prodigious
and vnnaturall, to teyne a dead man to be renated and newely
borne agayne. By the whiche open 
                     •
                  allax and vntrue surmyse setfoorth
and palliated with the vesture and garment of a professed veritee.
               Many of the noble men (as he well then perceued) toke and reputed it,
whiche was folishely and maliciously setfoorth to vnquyet &amp; perturbe
hym and his realme, to be a thinge true, iust and vnfeyned. So that he
then sawe as farre as lynce with his bright eyes, that this newe inuented
coment and poeticall peynted fable, woulde make some broyle and
discorde in hys realme. Except it were manifestly published and openly
declared to be a fayned fable, a sedicious fraude and a craftye imagened
mischiefe. Other persones, to whome warre, sedicion, and stryfe,
were as pleasaunt as delicate vyand or Epicures liuynge, were very
ioyous of these newes, and beleuinge no fraude nor deceate to be hid or
cloked vndre this golden tale. But whatsoeuer the fame was and the
voice that ranne abrode, that they reputed, syncere, true, and as an opē
playne thing, thinking that to redounde both to their aduauntage, cō
                  moditee
and hygh preferment and honoure, whiche thinge did greatly
animate and encourage them to set vp the sayles, and lanchefoorth the
ower of their pernicious and detestable entreprice. And because the
matter was weighty and requyred great aide and assistence. Therfore
they determined to sende messengers to the lady Margaret, to knowe
when Rychard dnke of Yorke might come conueniently into England
to thentent that they beyng thereof certefied might be in a redynes to
helpe and succoure hym at hys first arryuall.
            
            
               The .viii. yere.
               
                  SO by the common consent and agrement of the coniured
confederates, syr Robert Clifford knight, &amp; William Barley
were sent into Flaunders, which enucleated to the duches
all the secrete ententes and preuy counsayles of y• frē
                  des
and fautoures of the new founde duke. The duches
thys message did gladly accept and louyngly embrace, and of their tydinges
was not a litle ioyous, easely by her persuasion inducynge to
their heddes, that all thinges that were spoken of duke Rycharde were
true &amp; vnfeyned. And afterwarde brought them to the sight of Perkyn,
the which countrefeated the coūtenaunce and the maner and fassion of
Rychard duke of Yorke, praising his vertues &amp; qualitees, with y• which
he was endued aboue the mone. Thesayde syr Robert Clifford, when he
had sene &amp; w
                     •
                  l aduised the yoūg man, beleued surely that he was extracted
of the blood royall, and the very sonne of kyng Edward the .iiii. &amp;
therof he wrote a lettre of credite &amp; confidence into England to his cō
                  pany
&amp; felowes of his cōspiracy, &amp; to put them out of all doubte he affirmed
yt he knew him to be kinge Edwardes sonne by his face &amp; other
lyniamentes of his body. And when these lettres came to England, the

                  
                     •
                  heuetaynes of this busynes, to the entent to styrre the people to some
newe commocion and tumult, and to set foorth some cause of mattre apparaunt,
caused it opēly to be diuulged and published, that it was true
and not feigned that was spoken &amp; saide abroade of the duke of Yorke:
but it was done by such a secret crafte, that no mā coulde tell who was
the authoure and founder of that rumoure.
               When the kyng perceaued that this vayne fable was not vanyshed
oute of the mad breynes of the commen people, he thought it expedient
bothe for the sauegarde of hym selfe and also of hys countrey, whose
hurtes were ioyned and mixed together, to prouyde some remedy to represse
this Immynent mischaunce, not a litle suspectynge, that some
conspiracy had bene concluded and agreed, because that syr Robert

                     •
                  lyfforde had late fled preuely into Flaunders. Wherefore he sent
certayne knyghtes that wre chosen and picked men of warre, with a
bonde of sou
                     •
                  dioures into euery parte to kepe the shores &amp; the sea costes
surely, that no man might passe ouer into any foreyn lande bey ōd ye sea
nor repasse into thys realme without serche, or pasporte or saue cōduyte
by hym geuen, and all streytes▪ passages &amp; by pathes were kept &amp; searched,
so that no man vnapprehended coulde passe to the sea coaste, nor
make any conuenticle or assemble without he were espyed and taken.
And so thentent that many men, beyng both of England &amp; other places
for very malyce by this new inuencion enflamed and indurate, shoulde
no farther ronne in their freneticall madnes, he secretly sent wise espialles
to all the cytyes of the Gaule Belgique or lowe countrey within the
Archedukes dominion, and the confynes of thesame, to searche &amp; pryeou
                     •
                  e
of what progeny thys misnamed Rycharde was dissended and
propagate, promysynge highly too rewarde and thanke suche persones,
whiche woulde manifest and open the secrete doubtes and deuyses
of thesame matter: and besyde thys he wrote to hys trusty frendes
to do thesame. So they sailynge into Fraunce, deuided and seuered
them selfes euery man into a lymyte and prouynce. And when certayne
of them repayred to the toune of Turnay, they were there certefied
by the testimony of many honest persons, that this feigned duke
came but of a lowe stocke, and of a base parentage, &amp; was named there
Peter Warbecke. And so shortely after the kynges inquisitoures
returned into Englande, reportynge to the kynge what they had knowen
and hearde: Of whiche thynge the kynge was also more plainly
certefyed by hys trusty and faythefull frendes, both by letters and trusty
messengers.
               Wherupon seyng that nowe the fraude was openly and apparaūtly
manifested &amp; espied, he determined to haue it published &amp; declared wt
all diligent celerite, both in the realme of Englande &amp; also in all partes
beyonde the sea, in the prouynces of Foreyn prynces and straunge potētates.
And for thesame cause he sent to Philip archeduke of Burgoyn
and to hys counsayl
                     •
                  ers (because that he was not yet of mature age,

apte and conuenient to take the regimēt of hys countreys and 
                     ••
                  igniories)
Syr Edward Pownynges a valyaūt knight, and syr William
Warram doctour of the lawes, a man of great modestie, learnyng and
grauite, y• they should opēly to thē declare, that y• yōge man, beyng with
the lady Margaret was discended of a bsse and obscure parentage,
and that he had falsely and vntruly vsurped the name of Richard duke
of Yroke, whiche long before was murthered with hys brother Edwarde
in the Towre o
                     •
                   London, by the commaundement of kynge Rychard
their vncle, as many men lyuynge can testefie. And to thinke
and saye otherwyse then thys that apertly is knowen, it were the hyghest
poynte and degree of madnes, for asmuche as it is probable by
an inuincible reason and an argument infallible, that kyng Rycharde
their naturall vncle, in dispatching and destroiyng prynce Edward the
eldest sonne of kyng Edward his brother, was in no suertie of his realme
or vsurped dominion, if he had permitted Richard the yoūger sonne
to lyue and continew: For then might he as next heyre to hys brother
haue lawfully and by iust title claymed the sceptre and diademe royal,
whiche was hys fathers, and after diuoluted to hys elder brother. And
therfore they shoulde desyre the Archeduke and the prynces of his coū
                  sayl,
that it woulde please them to geue no credite, nor them selfes suffre
any more to be blynded or seduced with suche mere impostures and
craftie illusions beyng full of vntruthe and apparaunte falsehed, nor
yet to aide or assist suche a craftye merchaūt, whiche had falsely feigned
hys name and stocke, and in especially against him, which in few yeres
passed, had succoured and releued Maximilian their lorde beynge sore
oppressed and almost ouercome bothe with the extort powre and puyssaunce
of the Frenche kyng, also with the cyuyle discorde and intestine
rebellion of his awne subiectes and vassals. With these commaundementes
the Ambassadoures 
                     •
                  ayled into Flaunders, and there gētely receaued
and louingely enterteyned of the Archeduke Philip and his coūsayll,
And after that they were commaunded to declare the entent of
their legacion, docter William Warram priest, made before theym a
pleasaunt and a luculent oracion, shewyng therin discretely the mynde
entent and desyre of the kynge hys master: And in the later ende
of hys oracion, he a litle rebuked the lady Margaret and hyt her of the
thombes, saiynge that she nowe in her olde age, within fewe yeres
had produced and brought foorth two detestable monsters, that is to
saye Lambert (of whome rehersal was made before) and the other Perkyn
Warbeck, And beynge conceyued of these two greate babes, was
not of them delyuered in eight or nyne monethes as nature dothe requyre
and as all other women commonly do, but in the hundreth and
lxxx. monethes, she brought them foorth out of her wombe: for bothe
these at the least were fittene yeres of age before that she woulde be
broughte in bedde of them, and shewe them openly.
               
                  
And when they were newly crept out of her wombe, they were no infaū
                  tes,
nor suckyng chyldren, but lusty yongelinges, and of age sufficient
to byd battaile to kynges. Although these taūtes and Iestes did angre
and trouble the lady Margaret, yet Perkyn was more vexed and encombered
with the thinges declared in thys oracion, and in especial because
his fraude and false feigned iuggelinge was brought to light &amp;
opened: yet the duches beynge therwith more incensed then quenched,
nothyng refreignynge her olde malice and cancard hatred, but entendyng
to caste whote Sulpher to the newe kyndled fyre, determyned clerely
to arme and fetforward prety Perkyn agaynst the kyng of Engeland
with speare and shilde, might and mayne.
               When the Ambassadours had done their message, and the Archedukes
counsayll had longe debated whether Perkyn were the true sonne
of kynge Edwarde the fourthe, they aunswered the Ambassadours:
That to the entent to haue the loue and fauoure of the kynge of Engelande
assuredly after that tyme, the Archeduke nor they woulde neither
aide nor assist Perkyn nor hys complyces in any cause or quarell.
               Yet notwythstandinge, if the lady Margaret persistynge and contynuynge
in her roted malice towardes the kynge, woulde be to hym aidynge
and helpynge, it was not in their power to let or withstande it,
for because she in the landes assigned to her for her dower, might frankely
and freely do and ordre all thynges at her awne wyll and pleasure
without contradiccion of any other gouernour.
            
            
               The .ix. yere.
               
                  WHen thys aunswer was geuen to theym, they returned agayne
into Englande. After that, kyng Henry loking circumspectly
to his matters, purposed to pacefie the stormes
and blastes that he perceaued to be growyng, rather
by pollecy and counsayll, then by dubious warre &amp; manslaughter,
if his nobilite woulde therunto condiscende. For he well cō
                  sidred
that of one busynes riseth another, and of one small sparcle commeth
a great flame. And therefore straight he sent foorth certayne espialles
into Flaunders, which shoulde 
                     •
                  eigne them selues to haue fledde
vnto the duke of Yorke, and by that meanes searche foorth and inuestigate,
the whole intent of their coniuracion, and after what waye they
entended to procede in thesame. Other were sent also to allect and
entice syr Robert Clyfford, and William Barly to retorne into Englande,
promisynge to theim franke and free pardone, of all offences,
and crymes committed, and promocions, and rewardes, for obeynge to
the kynges request. These exploratours so traueyled in their affaires
and busynes that they brought to passe all thinges to their masters
desyre. For first they had perfight knowledge of the names of certayne

conspiratours agaynst the kyng. After they persuaded syr Robert Clifford
to leaue of that foolishe opinion, whiche had no sure grounde nor
foundacion to staye it selfe vpon. Albeit William Barley coulde not
be deduced from hys begonne enterprice, but that he woulde go forwarde
hedlynge with thesame, whiche taryed not longe in that deuelish
opinion. For within two yeres after thys, he repentynge hym of hys
foly, beyng reclaymed, and hauinge perdone geuen hym of the kyng, repaired
home to his natiue coūtrey, detesting hi &amp; hys foolish blindnes.
Whē the espialles had sped their purpose, one after another stale away
preuely from the feyned duke, and returned into Englande, bringynge
with them the names of certayne, which were chiefe of that conspiracy.
Other taryed still behynd to accompany syr Robert Clifforde, when he
returned agayne into England, whose tariynge meruelously debilitated
and appalled the courages, &amp; hartes, of the coniuratours. For thei
perceaued dayly that their enterprice more and more feynted, and that
they were by a little &amp; little dampnified and hurted. And yet they saw no
man whome they might perfightly put diffidēce in, or yet once mistrust.
               When the kyng had knowledge of the chief Capitaynes of this tumulte
by the ouerture of hys espyes, which were returned, he caused thē
all to be apprehended and brought to London before his presence. Of
the which the chief were Ihon Ratclyffe lord Fitzwater, syr Symonde
Moūforde, syr Thomas Twhaytz knightes, Williā Dawbeney, Robert
Ratclyffe, Thomas Cressenor, and Thomas Astwood. Also certain
priestes and religious men, as syr William Richeforde doctor of deuinitee,
and syr Thomas Poynes, bothe freers of sainct Dominikes order,
docter William Sutton▪ syr William Worsely deane of Paules,
and Robert layborne and syr Rychard Lessey. Other that were giltye
of thesame cryme, hearyng that many of their company were taken, fled
and toke sanctuary. And the other that were taken were condempned al
of treason, of the which there was hedded syr Symond Mounforde, syr
Robert Ratclyffe, &amp; Williā Dawbeney, as aucthoures and chiefe Capitaynes
of this busynes. The other were perdoned, and the Priestes
also for their ordre sake that they had taken, but fewe of them liued lōg
after. Also syr Ihon Ratclyfe, lord Fitzwater was pardoned of his life,
but after that he came to Caleys, and there layde in holde, he was behedded,
because he corrupted the kepers with many promises to haue escaped
out of thesame, entēding as was thought to haue gone to Perkyn.
               Kyng Henry of England, partely greued with the kyng of Romanes
for breakyng his promes, when he shoulde haue associated him in hys
iorney agaynst the French kyng, and partely displeased, with the Flē
                  mynges,
but principally with the lady Margaret, for kepyng and settyng
forward Perkyn Warbeck, not onely banished all Flēmyshe wares,
and marchaundises, out of hys realme and dominions, but also restreyned
all English merchaūtes, from their repaire and traffique, into
any of the landes &amp; territories, of the kynge of Romanes, or the Archeduke

hys sonne, causynge the marte of merchaundises and commoditees
of this realme to be kept at hys toune of Caleys.The marte 
                        〈…〉
                     
                   Wherfore the
sayde kynge and hys sonne banyshed oute of their landes and seigniories
all Englishe clothes, yarne, tynne, leade and other commodities
vpon great forfeytures and penalities. The restreint made by the king
sore greued and hindred the merchauntes, beynge aduenturers: For
they by force of thys cōmaundement had no occupiynge to beare their

thinge sore nypped their hartes, for the Easterlynges whiche were at
libertie, brought into the realme such wares as they were wont and accustomed
to do, and so serued their customers throughe oute the whole
realme: By reason whereof the masters beynge destitute of sale and
commutacion, neither reteyned so many couenaūt seruauntes and apprentices
as they before were accustomed, &amp; in especiall, Mercers, Haberdasshe

               For whiche cause thesayde seruauntes entendyng to woorke their malice
on the Easterlynges, the Tuesdaye before sayn

                      made vpon the Easterlinges. and beganne to rifle and spoyle such
chambres and warehouses as they could get into: So that the Easterlynges
had muche a do to withstande and repulse theym oute of their
gates. And whē their gates were fermed and closed, the multitude russhed
and bete at the gates with clubbes and leuers to haue entred, but
the Easterlynges by the helpe of Carpenters and Smythes, whiche
came to their aide by water oute of the borough of Southwarke had
so strongly shored and fortefied them selfes that they coulde not preuayle.
The Mayre of London hearynge of thys ryot, assembled ye Magestrates
and officiers of the citie together, and so beynge furnisshed
bothe with mē and weapon, set forward towarde the Stylyard. Assone
as the cōmynge of ye Mayre was intymate and knowen to the ryotous
persones, they fledde awaye lyke a flocke of shepe: howebeit he apprehended
diuerse of the malefactours and committed theim too seuerall
prysons. And vpon the inquiry before the kynges commissioners, there
were founde gyltie aboue .lxxx. seruauntes and apprentices (and not
one housholder) whyche were confederate together to make this attēpt
and sworne in no wyse to discouer or reuele thesame: Whereof, some
that were the cheueteynes and beginners of this mischeuous riot, were
sent to the Towre, and there longe continued. But in conclusion,
because none of their Masters were inuented culpable of thys naughtye
acte, the kynge of hys goodnes remitted their offence, and restored
them to their libertie.
            
            
               ¶The .x. yere.
               
                  
                  SHortely after, syr Robert Clyfford, partely trusting on the
kynges promes, &amp; partely mistrustyng the thing, because
he knewe that diuerse that were accused to be partakers of
that faccion and conspiracy were put in execucion: &amp; therfore
perceauyng that their could not be a more pernicious
nor more desperate begonne thinge then that deuelishe enterprice, returned
sodeynly agayn into England. The kynge beynge certefied before
of his cōming, went streight to the Towre of London the morow after
the daye of Epiphany, and there taryed til suche tyme that syr Robert
Clyfford was there presented to hys person, which thinge he vsed vnder
this pretence, that if syr Robert Clifforde had accused any of the nobilitie
to be partakers of this vngracious fraternitie &amp; diabolical comuraciō,
that then euery such person might be called thether without suspeccion
of any euell, &amp; there streight to be attached and cast in holde.
               But before I go any farther I wil shew the opinion that at that tyme
ranne in many mens heddes of this knyghtes goynge into Flaunders.
Some men helde this opinion, that kyng Henry for a polecy dyd
sende him as a spye to Flaunders, or els he woulde not haue so sone receaued
him into his grace and fauour agayn: Neuerthelesse this is not
like to be true by diuerse reasons and apparaūt argumentes, firste, after
that attempt begonne by syr Robert, he was in no smal daūgier himselfe,
and by that was not a litle noted, &amp; hys fame blemished, but also
hys frendes were suspected and had in a gealosy. Secondarely he was
not after y• in so great fauour, nor so estemed with the kynge as he had
been in tymes past, because he was blotted &amp; marked with that cryme &amp;
offence. And therfore he bearing his fauoure to the house of Yorke entendynge
in the beginning to administer displeasure to kyng Hēry, sayled
to the lady Margaret, beyng seduced &amp; brought in belefe y• Perkyn
was the very sonne of kynge Edward. But to my purpose, when syr
Robert came to the presence of the kynge, he knelyng on his knees most
humblye, beseched hym of grace and pardone, whiche he shortely obteyned.
And after that beynge requyred of the maner and ordre of the
comuracion, and what was done in Flaunders, he opened euery pointe
to his knowlege, and after disclosed the names, aswell of the aiders and
fautoures as of the inceptors and begynners. Emongest whome he accused
syr William Stanley, whome the kynge made hys chiefe chamberleyn,
and one of hys preuy counsayll. When he had so sayde, ye kyng
was greatly dismayed and greued, that he shoulde be partaker in that
greueous offence, considerynge first that he had the gouernaunce of his
chambre, and the charge and comptrolment of all suche as were next to
hys bodye, and also callynge to remembraunce the manifolde gratuities,
whiche he had receaued at hys hande, but in especiall not forgettynge
that benefite aboue all other, that onely by his aide and succoure,
he had vanquished and ouerthrowen his mortall enemy kynge Rycharde.
Wherefore, at the begynnynge he coulde in no wyse be induced

nor persuaded to beleue that he was such a preuy conspiratoure or malicio
                     •
                  s
offender, but when the cryme was openly proued and probably
affirmed, then the king caused hym to be restrayned from his libertie in
his awne chambre within the quadrate towre. And there appoynted
hym by his preuy counsayll to be examined. In whiche examinacion he
nothinge denyed, but wisely and seriously did astipulate and agree to
all thinges layed to hys charge, if he were in any of theim culpable or
blame woorthy.
               The reporte is, that this was his offence. When communicaciō was
had betwene hym, and this syr Robert Clifforde, as cōcerning Perkyn
whiche falsely vsurped the name of kyng Edwardes sonne, syr Williā
Stanley sayde and affirmed there, that he would neuer fight nor beare
armure agaynst the young man, if he knew of a truthe that he was the
indubitate sonne of kyng Edward the .iiii. Thys poynte argueth and
proueth hym at that tyme, beynge moued with melancholy, to beare no
great good will to kyng Henry, wherof suspicion first grewe, and after
this ensued the accusacion of syr Robert Clyfforde.
               Then the kyng doubtinge what to do with him, did cōsulte &amp; breath
with hym selfe of this sodeyne chaunce. For he feared least that his brother
lorde Thomas Stanley, in whome he had founde great frendship,
woulde take this mattre greueously. And if he should remit that fault,
or abusynge his lenyte and mercy, would be the more bolder to offende
and treaspace more highly. Albeit at the last, seueritee tooke place, and
mercy was put backe, and so he was arreigned at Westmynster, and
adiudged to dye, and accordinge to that iudgemente was broughte to
the towre hill the .xvi. daye of February, and there had hys head 
                     ••
                  rykē
of. What was the occasion and cause why the syncere and faythfull
mynde that syr William allways before bare to kyng Henry, was turned
into cancarde hatred and dispite, and why the especiall fauoure
that the kynge bare towarde hym was transmuted into disdeyne and
displeasure, dyuersemen alledge dyuerse causes, affirmynge that when
kynge Henry (what other mutuall benefites the one had receaued of
the other, I wyll nowe pretermyt and ouerpasse) in that battaile, in the
whiche he bereft kynge Rycharde bothe of hys life and hys kyngdom,
beynge associate and accompanied but with a small numbre, and circū
                  uented
by kynge Richardes army, &amp; in great ieopardy of his lyfe, thys
syr William beynge, sent from the lord Standley hys brother with a
good company of stronge and hardy men (whiche lorde Stanley was
nere the felde with a great army) came sodeynly and fortunately to the
succours of kynge Henry, and saued hym from destruccion, and ouerthrewe
kynge Rychard as before you haue heard. Surely thys was a
benefite aboue all benefites to be remembred, by the which kyng Hēry
was not onely preserued alyue, but also obteyned the croune &amp; kingdome,
which great benefite, after the kingdome once obteyned, he did neither
forget nor yet left vnrewarded. For the lord Thomas Stanley he

inuested with the swoorde of the countie of Darby &amp; beside other great
giftes &amp; officies geuen to Williā Stanley, he made him his chiefe chā
                  berleyn.
This syr William, although he were in great fauoure with the
kyng, &amp; had in great and high estimacion, more remēbring the benefite
done to the kyng, then the rewardes and gratuitees of his liberalite receaued,
thinking that the vessel of oyle, (according to the Gospel) would
ouerflowe the brymmes, &amp; as some saye, desiryng to be erle of Chestre &amp;
therof denyed, began to grudge &amp; disdeyne the kyng his high frēd: and
one thing encoraged him much, which was the riches &amp; treasure of kīg
Richard, which he onely possessed at ye conflict of Boswoorth: By reason
of which haboundance of ryches &amp; greate powre of people, he set naught
by ye kyng his souereign lord &amp; Mastre. When the king perceaued
that his stomack began to canker &amp; waxe rusty, he was with him not a
litle displeased, and so when bothe their hartes were enflamed with melancoly,
bothe loste the fruite of their longe cōtmued amitie &amp; fauoure.
And so it often chaunceth, that when men do not cōsider nor yet regard
the great benefites to them exhibited, they rendre agayne hatred for liberalitee,
and for breade geuen, they yelde agayne a scorpion. Nowe to
returne to the matter.
               At thys tyme the kyng thought it best, ye &amp; very necessary, not onely
to take hede about him, but also to vse some sharpe punyshmēt and correcciō
of the offences of his subiectes, to thētent y• the late begon sedicion
might the soner be repressed, &amp; for this cause specially y• some persons
voyde of all honest feare &amp; reuerent dread, had takē such courage
&amp; audacitie to them, that they feared not to speake euell of their kyng &amp;
souereign lord, with moost spiteful &amp; contumelious wordes, as though
thei neither feared nor woulde obey him, or his preceptes &amp; cōmaundementes,
expecting dayly and hourely the arryuall &amp; landing of the feyned
Rychard duke of Yorke, now lately rysen from death to lyfe. But
when knowlege of the slaunderous and opprobrious woordes were
brought to the kynges eares, he caused dyuerse persones to suffre condigne
punyshmēt for their heynous offences, wherby their cōplices wel
perceauyng y• their entreprice had no prosperous successe nor toke any
good effect, &amp; especially such as temerariously began to make mastries
and farther seyng what preparacion was made and prouyded agaynst
theyr tumulteous commocion &amp; frantique enterprice, they of their awne
swynge pacefied them selfes, and beganne to turne to their kynge and
naturall liege lorde.
            
            
               The .xi. yere.
               
                  AFter the death of syr William Stanley, Gyles lord Dabeney,
a man of Great fidelitie and circumspeccion was
elected and made the kynges chiefe chamberleyne. When
the kynge had thus polletiquely weded out the euell &amp; corrupt
hartes of his English subiectes, and had pacefied &amp;

brought all his realme to a monacorde and a quyet lyfe. Then he perceaued
that it was necessary also to purge &amp; clense his realme of Irelād
to thentent y• the venemous sede sowen &amp; planted .ii. yeres past emōgest
the wilde &amp; la
                     •
                  age Irish persons by Perkyn Warbeck might be cleane
cradicated &amp; plucked vp. Wherfore he sent syr Hēry Deane late Abbot
of Langtonye, a man of great wyt and diligēce (whome he made chaū
                  celour
of the Is
                     •
                  e) and syr Edward Pownynges knyght, with an army
of men into Ireland, to searche &amp; purge all such tounes &amp; places where
Perkyn was receaued, releued or fauoured. And if they espied any of
hys affinitee or faccion, then he would they should be punished with al
extremitie to the terrible example of all other that woulde enclyne too
that vnfortunate parte. And first, after their arryuall into Irelande,
they called in the kynges name the nobilitee of that country to a coū
                  sayll,
where they beyng assembled all together, the Chauncelour with a
gentle exhortacion requyred them first to persist in due obedyence and
fidelitie towardes their kynge, and to aide hys capitayne syr Edwarde
Pownynges with their might, powre &amp; strength agaynst such rebelles
whiche eyther through blyndnes and folye, or elles through desyre and
appetide to do euell, lusteyned and aided Perkyn with harneys, menne
or money. Euery man promysed openly to helpe with all their powre
and might: But they promysed not so quickly, but they performed it
as slowely, for fewe or none either aided or assisted him, as who woulde
saye, that they loued the English nacion more with their outward coū
                  tenaunce,
then in their inwarde hartes &amp; myndes. But when they heard
that syr Edward Pownynges was come to persecute al suche as were
fautoures and frendes to Perkyn Warbeck, there was no man, although
he were but a litle contamynate wyth that 
                     •
                  edicious infeccion, but
he fled oute of hand into woodes and marises for the defence and sauegarde
of them selfes, there consultyng together, after the maner of their
countrey, in what places they might best lye in wayte to infest and skyrmyshe
with the Englishmen, or els if nede shoulde so requyre to fighte
with them hand to hande.
               In Ireland there be two kynd of men, one softe, gentle, ciuile &amp; curteous:
And to these people, as to the mooste rychest and best nurtured
persons dothe many merchaunt men of the countreys adioyning, daily
resorte, frequent, contract, bergayne, and make marchaundise. But because
the moost resorte thether is of the English nacion, the Irish men
folow &amp; coūtrefeate their ciuile maners &amp; honest cōdiciōs. And by reason
of ye cōmō trade and entrecourse betwene thē, they haue learned ye
English toūg, &amp; can both speake &amp; vnderstād it. And all this kynde of
people is vnder y• subiecciō &amp; dominiō of ye kyng of Englād. The other
kynde is cleane cōtrary frō this, for they be wilde, rustical, folish, fierce,
&amp; for their vnmanerly behauior &amp; rude fassiōs, are called wild
                     •
                   &amp; sauage
Irishmen. And these men haue many gouernours &amp; seuetall rulers,
whiche kepe continual battaile, and dayly warre emongest them selfes.

for y• which cause thei be more fierce, more bolde &amp; hardy then theother
Irishmē, and thei be very desyrous of newe thinges &amp; straunge sightes
and gasynges, &amp; after robbery, theft &amp; rapyne, in nothyng so much delytyng
as with tumulteous sedicion &amp; continual strife. And to these wilde
coaltes Perkyn shewed hym selfe first, easely persuadynge theim to beleue
that he was thesame verey person whome he falsely fayned and
countrefeated.
               Wherfore Sir Edward pownynges accordynge to his commission,
entending to punishe suche as haue bene aiders and auauncers of Perkyns
foolishe enterprice, with his whole army, marched forward against
this wilde Irishmen, because yt all other beynge culpable of that offence
fled and resorted to theim for succoure and defence, to thentent that they
bothe together might be hable to resist &amp; defye their enemies. But when
he sawe that his purpose succeded not as he wisshed it, bothe because the
Irysh lordes sent hym no succour accordynge to their promises, and also
considerynge that his nombre was not sufficiente to set on the wilde
people beynge dispersed emongest woodes, mounteyns and marishes,
was of necessitee, compelled to recule and returne, frettyng and vexed in
his stomacke, because he suspected ye Geralde erle of Kyldare beyng then
the kynges deputie, was the cause &amp; occasion yt he had no succoures nor
ayde sent to him, and so he was enformed of suche as bare to the erle no
good will. And therfore sodeinly he caused the erle to be apprehended,
and as a prisoner brought hym in his company into England: Where,
when he was examined and certeine matters of treason layed to his
charge, he auoyded theim all, and clerely (suche was his wytt and innocencye)
quit hym selfe and layed the burden in other mennes neckes:
               Whome the kyng dimissed and sent hym into Ireland agayne, there to
be his deputie and Lieutenaunt as he was before. The kyng like a polletique
prince had many greate and weightie consideracions whiche refreyned
hym from vsynge of any seueritie or extremitie againste this
earle, contrary to the myndes and willes of his malicious aduersaries.
One was the great aucthoritee and swynge that he bare emōgest the Iryshe
nacion: Also the condicion and state of the tyme, wherin he fauoured
some sedicion to bee in brewyng: And chiefely of all the assured hope
and affiaunce that he conceaued in him.
               So that nowe the kyng beyng oute of all feare of battaile, dyd take
his progresse into Lancasshire the .xxv. daie of Iuyn, there to recreate
his spirites and solace him selfe with his mother the Lady Margarete
wife to the Earle of Darby, whiche then laye at lathome in that countrey.
While these thinges were thus done in England, Perkyn warbeck
then beyng in Flaunders, although he had taken great care and sorowe
for that his craftie conueighaunce was espied and openly knowen, and
also that kyng Henry had afflicted and punished diuerse of his confederates
and alyes, and therby in despaire of all the ayde and succour that
was to hym promysed and appoyncted: Yet he determined not to leaue

the hope and trust that he had conceaued in his mad head to obteyne
the crowne and realme of Englande, and so gatherynge a greate armye
of valyaunt Capiteyns of all nacions, some banqueroutes, some
false Englyshe sanctuary men, some theues, robbers and vacaboundes,
whiche leauynge their bodely laboure desyrynge only to lyue of
robbery and rapine, came to be his seruauntes and souldioures. And so
beynge furnyshed with this rablemente of knaues, tooke suche shippes
as hys frendes had prouyded for hym, and departed oute of Flaunders,
entendynge to arryue in Englande whersoeuer the winde brought
hym. And by chaunce of fortune he was dryuen vpon the Kentyshe coaste,
where because y• see was calmed, he cast his anchors and there made
his abode, and sent certeine of his retinewe to the lande to signifie to all
the countrey that he was so furnyshed of all thinges mete and cōuenyēt
for his entreprice, that there was no doubte but the victory woulde enclyne
to his parte. And by this meanes to make exploracion and enquirye
whether the Kentishmen woulde take his parte and folowe hym as
their capitayne, whiche before tymes was not tymerous nor afraide of
their awne mynde in troubleous seasons to moue warre againste theyr
prynces. The Kentyshmen hearynge that this feyned duke was come,
and had heard that he was but a peinted ymage, doubtyng a space what
to doo, whether to helpe him or to resist his powre, at the last remēbryng
what euell chaunces their forefathers had, and howe smal a profite such
as haue rebelled haue gayned, thought yt neither expedient nor profitable
for theim to aide &amp; assyst hym that came rather to spoyle, destroye &amp;
wast the countrey, then to conquere it for their wealthe &amp; cōmoditee. And
this thei firmely coniectured because he had none other with him but Alienes
and straunge people, which would take &amp; accompte euery church
toune, chapell, house &amp; euery priuate man as a pray and a lucre, and not
as their natyue countrey. Wherfore thei fearyng the sequele, determyned
st
                     •
                  ll to abide trewe to their kyng and prince, &amp; to fall vpon suche as
were newe come to land out of their shippes. Andwhile thei were assemblyng
of theim selues together, other should by fayre promises &amp; frēdly
woordes allure &amp; calle vnto theim the great nombre out of the shippes,
and so geue theim battaill. And so vsyng this guyle and imposture, thei
promised all to folowe him and to fight vndre his banner: Howbeit the
prolongyng of time draue Perkyn into a suspicion, which wel remēbred
y• a comminaltie is not accustomed sagely to cōsult, but sodeinly &amp; temerariously
to ronne hedlyng euer into rebellion &amp; newe flirred cōmocion.
Wherfore Perkyn determined not once to set foote oute of his ship tyll
he sawe al thing sure wtout any scruple or ambiguitee. And although he
mynded not to take land him selfe, yet he permitted certeyne of his souldiours
to go on land, which persones beyng a prety waye frō their shippes,
were sodeinly circūuented &amp; compassed by the Kentyshmen, &amp; at one
stroke vanquyshed and dryuen backe to their shippes, &amp; ther were takē
prisoners an hundred and .lx. persons, whereof .v. were named capticins

Mountfōrde, Corbet, white belt, quyntine or otherwyse Genyn. Whiche
rebelles were brought by sir Ihon Pechy shreue of kēt, to Londō railed
in ropes like horses drawyng in a carte. And after vpon their arraynement,
confessed their offence, and were executed, some at London, &amp; other
in the tounes adioynynge to the see coaste. Wherfore Perkyn failyng of
his purpo
                     •
                  e fled back into Flaunders and there taried, consultyng with
his frendes vntill suche tyme as he had better prepared for thinges to
come more prudently then he had done before tyme.

to kyng Edward ye fourth and kyng Richard at her castel of Barkamstede,
a woman of small stature, but of muche honour and high parentage,
and was buryed by her husband in the colledge of Fodringey.
               The kyng beyng aduertised y• his enemies had made entreaunce into
his realme, left of his progresse &amp; purposed to returne to London again,
but beyng certified ye next daie after of ye lucky spede &amp; fortunate chaūce
continued and wēt foorth of his progresse, sendyng to theim sir Richard
Gylforde, bothe to praise the

                  idelite &amp; manhoode of the people, and also
to rendre to theim his moost harty thankes for their good seruice to him
done, wt faithfull promes not to forget theim herafter in their sutes, requestes
&amp; peticions. Also that thei might not haue any successe herafter
into those partes, the kyng cōmaunded the watches to be kept all alōge
the see coastes, and bekons to be erected accordyng to the aunciēt vsage
and custome of the countrey.
               Peter and his capiteins takyng coūcel together in Flaundres, were
of one assent resolued to this poinct, y• there was nothynge more surer to
theim, then to procede quickly wt all celerite in their incepted entreprice.
And when thei perceaued y• there was neither people toune nor coūtrey

                  ical frenesy which
nothyng was mitigated, least y• by protractyng of tyme and longe space

wt souldiours &amp; men of warre, which thinge thei heard saye yt he neither

tariyng should appalle &amp; discōforte his preuy frendes wtin y• realme of
England. Wherfore he gathered together his vngracious cōpany, &amp; determined
first to sayle into Ireland, there to augmēt his nōber. And frō
thence if yt were possible to saile into y• west partes of England. And yf
there were any let or obstacle in that place, then he determined to saile
streight into Scotlād, knowyng y• seldome or neuer is perfight cōcorde
&amp; amitie betwene ye Scottes &amp; ye English naciō. When this gētle coūcel
was dissolued, &amp; wynd and wether serued, he set vp his sayles, &amp; hauyng
a prosperous gale after his phantasy, sayled into Ireland, where he reposed
hym selfe a space. And remembryng yt the hope of victory cōsisted
not whole in the Irysh nacion, which beynge naked men wtout harneys
or armure were not hable to cōbate with the Englishmē wherfore when
the wynde serued hym he departed frō Corffe and arryued in Scotlād,

and commyng to the kyngs presence, with great solempnite, framed his
tale after the forme and fassion folowyng.
               I thinke yt is not vnknowen to you, moost noble kyng and puissaūt
prince, into what ruyne the stock, house and familie of Edward ye fourth
of that name kyng of England, is nowe of late brought to and fallē in,
eyther by Goddes permission or by deuine punishement, whose vndubitate
sonne (yf you knowe not all ready) I am, &amp; by the powre of almightie
God, preserued a
                     •
                  yue to this houre from the mighty hād of a tyraūt.
For my father kyng Edward when he dyed, appoyncted his brother Richard
duke of Gloucester to be oure gouernour, protectour &amp; defendor,
whome y• more that he loued &amp; studied to auaunce and promote, y• better
he thought y• he would loue, fauoure, and tendre his chyldren. But alas
my infortunate chaunce I may saye, howe hath his trust bee turned into
treason? and his hope turned to hindreaunce? All men knowe and I
feele. Oure vncle was not the tutoure and preseruer of our stocke and
lynage, but the confounder and destroier of our bloude and progenye.
               For that tyraunt blynded and glutted with the cupiditie of rulynge and
souereigntie commaunded Edward my brother and me to be slaine and
dispatched oute of this mortall lyfe. Wherupon that person, to whome
the weightie and cruell charge was committed and geuen to oppresse &amp;
destroye vs poore innocent enfantes and gilteles babes, the more that
he abhorred this heynous and bocherly offence the more he feared to cō
                  myt
yt. And so waueryng in mynde &amp; dubious what to doo, at the lēgth,
willynge in parte to saciate the blody thrust of the vnnatural tyraunt,
and in parte to absteyne from so facinerous and detestable homicide,
destroyed my brother and preserued me, lyke the good Prieste Iosada
which saued lytle Ioas when all the children of the blude, royall were
commaunded by Athalia the quene to be slayne and vtterly destroyed.
And farther, to thentent that my lyfe might be in a suretie, he apoincted
one to conuey me into some straunge countrey, where when I was furthest
of and had moost nede of comfort he forsooke me sodeinly (I think
he was so apoincted to do) and left me desolate alone without frende or
knowlege of any reliefe or refuge. And so kynge Richarde dyd obteyne
the croune as a praye mischeueously gotten by the dispatchynge awaye
of my brother and me. So that I thus escapynge, by reason of my tendre
infancy, for gate almost my self and knewe not wel what I was, but
after long wanderyng from countrey to countrey, and frō citee to citee,
I perceaued and learned a lytle &amp; litle what was my 
                     •
                  state and degree,
and so in conclusion came to mine awne anute the lady Margaret liyng
in Flaundres, whiche was sometyme maried to Charles duke of Bourgoyne,
whiche as ioyfully receaued and welcommed me as yf I had come
oute of hell into heauen, as the only type and garland of her noble
stirpe and lynage, but forasmuche as she beyng only dowager of ye duchy
of Bourgoine, and hauyng nothing but her dowre propre vnto her
self, was not of powre to helpe me wt men &amp; munimētes of warre as she

woulde gladly haue done for the recouery of my fathers realme &amp; rightfull
inheritaunce, I therefore am dryuen to seke farther ayde and succoure.
And therefore by her councell and aduertisement, with this small
handfull of men of warre and souldioures, I am repayred to your presence
for succours, of whome (as the publike fame is spred ouer y• whole
worlde) there was neuer man by wrong or iniurie profligated or dryuen
oute of his countrey, region or inheritaunce, or by extorte powre and tiranny
kept out of thesame (as I my selfe from myne infancie haue bene)
whose request was frustrate and repulsed at your hand. Therefore by
the maieitie of your realme and countrey I desyre, and heartly with
prayer as I can, I beseche and exhorte you to helpe and releue me now
in my extreme necessite. And yf yt chaunce me by your ayde and succour
to recouer and possede my fathers realme &amp; dignitie, not only I, but all
the kyngs of our lynage which her after shall obteyne thesame, shalbe so
muche obliged and bounde vnto you, that they must nedes thynke that
doynge to you al the pleasure and benefites that thei can, yet with al the
thankes y• can be geuen, your great kindenes can neuer be equiualently
recompensed.
               When he had thus saide, the kyng bad hym be of good comforte, and
promysed hym that whatsoeuer he ware, yt shoulde neuer repent hym of
his commynge to hym. And after this the kynge assembled his councell
together, and demaunded of euery man seuerally, what they sayde, of
these thynges whych perkyn had both enucleated and requyred, or whether
they woulde take any farther deliberacion to aduyse theim selfes
what to do in so great and weyghtie a matter. They that were of greatest
experience and of the mysest sorte did proue by many apparaunt argumentes
that his saiynges were but dreames and fantesies and of no
force or truthe and therefore they thought yt not conuenient to encombre
theim selfes with any lengre consultation. Another sorte, which was
not very great, neyther of wyt nor experiēce, but greater in nomber, estemed
this matter very profitable to the common wealthe, consideryng yt
ministred to theim occasion to make warre in Englande. And although
thei had knowlege what good successe Perkyn had enioyed in al his former
attemptes, yet they estemed that nowe all thynges shoulde succede
accordynge to their expectacion, yf his cause (although yt were as lyght
as a fether) were assumed and taken in hand to be defended, consideryng
that when the warre was once intimate and begonne, and yf perkyn did
preuayle, he woulde deny nothynge conuenient to his frendes and helpers.
Or elles at y• least thei doubted not but kyng Henry woulde make
to theim large and ample offers &amp; condicions of peace, rather then kyng
Iames shoulde take parte with his aduersary and mortall ennemye.
               When this councell was geuen by the more nomber, yt was well accepted,
and the Skottishe kyng, whether he were blynded by errour, or els
dyd dissimule the matter, beganne to haue Perkyn in great honour, and
caused hym openly to be called duke of Yorke. Also, that this might be

more apparaunt to the people y• he was so in dede, he caused lady Katheryn
daughter to Alexandre erle of Hūtley, his nigh kynsman &amp; of a high
lignage in Scotland, to be espoused to him. And this affinite he caused
to be made for this ende &amp; purpose, partly yt he might extenuate ye euell
will &amp; malice which was lyke to succede of this matter, for that it might
be notoriously blasted and knowen abroade yt he had peace &amp; amity wt y•
king of Englād, &amp; partly least he might be accused of to much light credē
                  ce
it Perkī were foūd &amp; proued to be another mā then he was reported.
               When all thyngs were prepared, ordred and apoyncted for y• warre.
This Perkyn swellyng with ioye that he after his awne phantasye had
made the Scottes to be his partakers. And to thentent that they should
put no diffidence in the sequele of his entreprice, &amp; to encourage theim y•
more he pronounced suerly y• he should haue great succour &amp; aide of his
frendes in England sent euen from y• farthest part therof assone as euer
the trompet of warre was blowen. The Scottes although thei had but
lytle confidence &amp; lesse trust in his wordes, yet puttyng their hope more
in ye gayne of spoyle then in y• gainyng of the victory by battayle, armed
theim selfes in all y• hast &amp; marched toward the confines and borders of

countrey of Northumberlād, and had gone foorth farther, but that they
perceaued no aide or succoure to come oute of England to attende vpon
this newe duke. And the souldiours beynge fully laden with blood and
spoyle, refused to go one foote farther at that tyme, &amp; the countrey roase
on euery parte, whiche made the kynge suspecte some army to approche.
Wherfore he determined rather to retourne with his assured gaine, then
to tary the nuncupatiue dukes vnsure and vncerteine victory, and so he

                     •
                  led again into Scotland.
               It is a worlde to remember in this place of a certein kynde of ridiculous

mercy and foolish cōpassion, by the which Perkyn was so sore moued
that yt semed hym to regarde nothyng more then the commodite of
another man. For wile the Scottish kyng thus vexed &amp; haryed y• poore
inhabitaūtes on the borders of Northūberland, so y• nothing was heard
but torynge, wepyng and lamentyng. This newe muented duke beyng
returned into Scotland, euen lyke hym selfe, which wrought all thynge
 wt fraude and deceyte, perceauyng that no concurse nor resorte of Englishmen
shewed theim selfes in opē apparaunce to ministre to him aide
or succour, and fearyng not a lytle that the boxe of his crafty dealyng, &amp;
bagge of his secrete coūtrefeatyng should be elucydate &amp; set in an open
glasse by reason wherof he should be floccipended and had in cōtempt &amp;
disdeyg
                     ••
                  e of the Scottish people, as though he had bene therūto prouoked
by a naturall inclinacion and paternal pitie (to thentent to hide and
palliate his subtyl subornacion) cryed out openly, Oh, my stony &amp; heard
frosen harte which arte not once moued nor yet afflicted wt the losse and
slaughter of so many of thyne awne naturall subiectes &amp; vassales. And
at that glorious sighynge, he beseched the Scottish kyng that frō thēce
foorth he woulde not afflicte and p
                     •
                  age his people, nor deforme and deface
his naturall realme and countrey with such terrible fyer, flame and
hauocke. As who woulde saye, that he beynge ouercome wt the perfight
loue of his natiue region, beganne nowe to haue compassion and to lament
the cruell destruccion of thesame. The Scottish kynge whiche beganne
to perceaue whiche waye the wynde blewe answere him againe,
Sir me thinketh you take much peyne, and very much imagen howe to
preserue the realme of another prince which is not youres (but I thinke
you would gladly haue it) but my mynd geueth me that you be as farre
from the obteygnyng thesame, as you be nere the soyle and aspect of the
countrey consideryng that you cal England your land and realme, and
thinhabitauntes therof your people and subiectes, and yet not one mā,
neither gentle man nor yoman will once shewe hym selfe to aide or assist
you in ye warre begonne for your cause &amp; in your name wtin your realme
to the which you be bothe (as you saye) inheritoure, and by your people
accereited and vocated vnto. And so the kyng reproued the lightnes of
this younge fond foundelyng, and euery daie more and more neglected
and lesse phantesied and gaue credite to him, nothyng well and wisely y•
neyther his woordes, with his deedes, not the sequele of factes with hys
promises were neither agreable nor consonant.
               The nobles inhabitynge in the north partes herynge the clamour of
the commen people, and perceauynge that thei fled to aduoyde the crueltie
of y• Scottes, were sodeinly abasshed and fortefied their holdes and
manned their fortresses ready to defende their enemies, laiyng embushementes
in ye waies, where thei imagened yt there enemies would resorte.
And wtout delay certified the kyng of y• Scottes inuasion &amp; entreprice.
The kyng was not a litle abashed at this sodeyne chaūce, &amp; pricked also
wt his awn domestical busines, not alonely fearīg his outward enemies

but also his awne nobles &amp; naturall subiectes least any of theim would
steppe from him to theother parte, and put hym to farther trouble &amp; vexacion.
Wherefore, assone as he heard these newes, considering the matter

                   no small importaunce and mete to be vigilantly forsene, with
all diligence prepared oportune remedies to resist and withstand ye first
brunt of so great a sourge newely begonne. But the sodeine retreyte of
the Scottes agayne assuaged all the Englishe mennes swift acceleracions
and spedy prouisions: For when thei were once laden with prayes
and spoyles, they returned home agayne or thenglishmē coulde assemble
together.
            
            
               ¶The xii yere.
               
                  WHen the king was truly certified yt the Scotishe kyng was
returned, he geuing praise to his captaines and other inhabiting
on the bordures of his realme, whiche had duly and
truly serued him at that time, did desiste and leaue of for to
occurre and repugne the malicious inuasions of the Scottishe
kynge. And yet fearynge least his enemies shoulde be encouraged
and indated with this great gaine of spoyles and prayes, he determined
by 
                     •
                  ent of sworde and mortall warre to reuenge and reforme the manifest
iniurie and apparaunt wrong to hym by kyng Iames and his people
done and committed. Wherefore he assemblynge his courte of parliament,
declared the cause of the instant warre, and what remedy he
hym selfe had inuented and deuised, persuadynge with many strong argumentes
and reasons inuincible, that it shoulde be for the profite and
vtilite of the publique and common wealthe to prosecute and folowe y•
warre by his mortall enemies begonne and attempted. To this opinion
all his nobilitee (whiche were no lesse offended with this proude bragg
of the Scottish nacion then he hym selfe) dyd wyllingly agree &amp; gladly
assent. And to the maintenaunce of the warre and towarde the charges
of thesame, a certeine subsedy and taxe of money was with one assent by
the whole parliament liberally &amp; frely geuen &amp; graunted: Whiche payment
although it was but easy and small, yet many of the cōmon people
which euer abhorre such taxes and exaccions, grudged sore to paye
thes
                     •
                  me.
               At this parliament also and conuocacion, ther was certeyne lawes,
a
                     •
                  ts and statutes confirmed &amp; made, as were thought moost necessary
and expedient for the publique weale of the realme. And thus the kyng
dissoluynge his courte of parliament, prepared for warre out of hand.
In this meane ceason the kynge of Scottes not slepinge hys matters
because he perceaued well that the Englishmen wold shortely reuenge
theyr losse and harme, with no lesse diligence gathered an hoost &amp; puyssant
army, that either he might withstand and resist the English powre
inuadyng his realme &amp; countrey, or els of freshe entre vpō the bordres:
and goyng foorth, spoyle, robbe and make hauoke ageyne. And so these

twoo valiaunt princes mynded nothyng lesse the one to hurt and preiudice
theother, But the kyng of England sore prycked and woūded with
the iniurie to him committed, was so sore moued against the Scottysh
kyng, that he would not procrastinate nor deferre one houre tyl he were
reuenged. And so prepared a puissaunt and vigorious army to inuade
Scotland, and therof ordeyned for cheuetayne Gyles lord Dawbeney
his chiefe chamberleyn, a man of no lesse wytt then pollecy &amp; of no lesse
pollecy then hardines.
               When the lord Dawbeney had his army assembled together and was
in his iourney forward into Scotlande, he sodeinly was stayed and reuoked
agayne, by reason of a newe sedicion and tumult begonne within
the realme of England for the subsedy whiche was graunted at the last
parliament for the defence of the Scottes with all diligence and celeritee,
whiche of the moost parte was truely satisfied and payde. But the
Cornyshe men inhabityng the least parte of the realme, and thesame sterile
and without all fecunditee, compleyned and grudged greatly affirmyng
that they were not hable to paye suche a greate somme as was of
theim demaunded. And so, what with angre, and what with sorowe, forgettynge
their due obeysaunce, beganne temerariously to speake of the
kyng him selfe. And after leuyng y• matter, lamentyng, yellyng &amp; criyng
maliciously, sayd, that the kyngs coūsayll was the cause of this pollyng
and shauyng. And so beyng in this rage menaced to death the aucthoures
(as thei imagened) of this myschiefe and sorowe, whome thei threatened
shortely to dispatche out of this worlde. And so beyng in aroare .ii.
of thesame affinitee, ye one called Thomas Flamocke gentleman, learned
in the lawes of the realme, and theother Mighell Ioseph a smyth, mē of
high courages &amp; stoute stomackes, toke vpon theim to be captaynes of
this vngracious flocke and sedicious company. And although thei perceaued
their cōpany to be accensed &amp; inflamed wt fury &amp; malice ynough,
yet to augmēt &amp; encreace their madnes, thei cast oyle &amp; pitche into a fyre
&amp; ceased not to prouoke &amp; prick theim forward like frantique persons to
more mischiefe cryenge out openly &amp; pronouncynge y• it was shame (for
a smal cōmocion made of y• Scottes, which was asswaged &amp; ended in a
moment (for they thought poore folishe and ignoraunt fooles, ye al thinges
was ended and asswaged whē it was euē at the whottest &amp; most feruent)
thei should be exacted and polled, and suche great exaccions layed
vpon their necks, and especially on ye Cornyshmen, which thei affirmed
to bee but poore men, and beyng in a sterile &amp; vnfruitefull countrey gate
their lyuyng hardly by minynge and diggyng tynne and metall oute of
the grounde bothe daye and night labouryng and turmoylyng. And
therefore they had rather dye and suffre extreme punyshment, then lyue
in suche calamitee and wretchednes. And they laide the faulte and cause
of this exaccion to Ihon Morton Archebyshop of Cauntourbury, and
Sir Reignold Breye, because they were chiefe of the kinges preuy, coū
                  sayll.
Suche rewardes haue thei that be in great aucthorite wt kyngs &amp;

princes. For yf any thinge succede well accordinge to the mynd &amp; pleasure

                  iwise, yf any thing be done, either by chaune or
by councell that soundeth not well in theyr eares, or is contrary to their
opinion or fantesy, they will laye it streight to the councell saynge that
they haue persuaded him to do this &amp; that. Therfore if all men woulde
well remembre and diligently pondre in theyr myndes what is the reward
and guerdone, fewe would laboure &amp; affectcously de

                  yre to moūte
so high, or aspyre to that place of dignitee. But now to the mattre.
               These capiteynes exhorted the common people to put on harneys, &amp;
not to be a
                     •
                  earde to folowe theim in this quarell, promisyng theim that
they shoulde do no damage to any creature, but only to se ponyshement
and correcciō done to such persons which were the aucthours &amp; causers
that the people were molested and vexed with such vnreasonable exaccions
and demaūdes. And yf they perceaued any person (as they espied
many in dede) which dyd impugne and reproue theyr mad, vnreasonable
and sedicious councell, affirmynge that it was the hyghest poynct of
madnes for a mā to put his life in hasard for that thing, which he ought
mekely and humbly to requyre and desyre of hys prince and souereigne
lorde, then they called theim dastardes fooles, &amp; cowardes, &amp; taunted &amp;
rebuked theim with moost shamefull reproches &amp; contumelious inu
                     •
                  ccions.
So these vnhappy capiteynes nothinge more desyred then to
bringe theyr flocke &amp; theim selues to small perdicion &amp; vttre confucion.
With these bragges &amp; mocyons a great part of the people were eleuate
and encouraged and condescended to do as the capiteynes &amp; the moost
multytude woulde agree and appoynct. Then the capiteynes preysinge
muche the hardynes of the people, when all thinges were prepared mete
for theyr vnfortunate iourney, set forwarde with theyr army, &amp; came to

commissioners of the subsedy, &amp; from thence came to welles, &amp; so entendynge
to go to London where the kynge then so iourned.
               When the kynge was aduertised by his collectours, and officiers of
all these doynges, and attemptes, he was meruelously astōned, &amp; especially
because at that one tyme he was enuyrored with double warre, both
externe and intestyne. And because perell dyd depende on bothe, he was
in great doubte which of both he should moost regarde. And as he was
musynge of this mattre, he was asserteyned that

nerer &amp; nerer, almost to hys very gates, determined wyth all his whole
powre to resyst and represse thesame. And after that tumult appeased &amp;
suppeditate he would wt all expedicion set vpon Scotlād. Wherfore he
reuoked agayn the lord Dawbeney which as you haue heard was with
a puyssaunt army goyng into Scotland, whose army he encreaced and

multiplied with many pycked and freshe warryers, that he might y• better,
and with lesse laboure ouercome these rebelles. Also mystrustynge
that the Scottes myght nowe (hauynge good oportunitie seynge him
troubled with this ciuile discorde) inuade the realme agayne, and so
spoyle, robbe, violate and destroye the borderers, he appoincted the lord
Thomas Hawarde Earle of Surrey, a puissaunt and polletyke capyteyne
(whyche was taken prisoner at the ouerthrowe of kyng Rycharde
as you haue hearde, and after set at libertie, and within twoo yeres next
after was made high treasourer of Englande after the deathe of Ihon
Lorde Dynham) to gather abonde of men in the countye palantine of
Durham, and they with the aide and helpe of the inhabitauntes adioynynge
and the borderers, to driue out and expell the Scottes from of y•
borders yf they should fortune agayne to inuade, vntyll such time y• the
Cornyshemen beyng subdued and pacefied (whiche he thought easye to
be done) he might sende to theim the forsaide lorde Dawbeney again wt
all his powre &amp; army. When the nobles of the realme heard of this tumul
                     •
                  eous
busynes &amp; terrible cōmocion, they came to London euery mā
with as many mē of warre as thei could put in aredines to aide y• kyng
yf nede should bee: In the which company, there was the erle of Essex, y•
lord Mongey with diuerse other.
               At this tyme and ceason, Charles the French kyng returnynge from
y• warres yt he had at Napels, sent ambassadoures to enforme the kyng
of the prosperous successe and victorye that he had obteyned in Italye,
and gaue to theim in charge to desyre of the kyng of England nothinge
so muche as the contynuaunce of his amitie and fauoure towarde their
master and souereigne lord. For the French kyng sore desyred to contynue
in perfight peace &amp; amitie wt the kyng of England. And not without
a cause, for he had so vexed and combred him selfe and his people with
such Italian snares &amp; craftie engynes, out of y• which at this day beyng
the yere of your lord a thousand .v.C.xliiii. his successors cannot cleane
be ryd, and delyuered.
               When y• kyng was enformed y• kyng Charles orators were come to
Calys, he sent certeine of his nobilitie, honorably to receaue theim, &amp; so
to cōueigh theim to Douer, &amp; there for a polleey to make their abode tyl
the rebellion were extinct and suppressed, and not one woorde therof to
be sounded in the eares of the Ambassadours: Which commaundement
was circumspectly kept and obserued.
               And nowe y• Cornyshmen departyng frō Welles (where thei receaued
their chiefe capiteyne, Iames lord Audeleigh) went to Salsbury, &amp; from
thence to Winchester, and so to kēt, where thei looked for helpe, but thei
were deceaued in their expectacion. For the erle of Kent, George lord of
Burgemy, Ihon brooke lord Cobham, Sir Edward pownynges, Sir
Richard Guldeforde, Sir Thomas Burchier, Ihon Peche, Wyllyam
Scott &amp; a great nombre of people were not only prest and ready to defende
the countrey from all mischiefe and destruccion, but also bent and

determined to fight and combate with suche as woulde not be obedient
to their naturall souereigne lord, and to his lawes and preceptes. Also y•
kentysh men theim selues, partely remembryng that other commocions
haue bene to their dammage and great hindreaunce, and partely beyng
vnder the defence of their nobilitee, as vnder the Erle and other, would
not so much as come nere to the rebelles, nor yet either make coūtenaūce
or once speake to any of theim, to thentent that the kynge shoulde in no
wise conceaue any poynct of vntruth or treason in the poorest of theim.
Whiche thynge so appalled and dismayed the hartes and courages of
many of the brute and rurall Cornyshmen (whiche seynge theim selues
deceaued and defrauded of their chiefe hope and succours, and fearynge
the euell chaunce that might happen to theim) that thei to saue theim selfes
fled preuely in the night from their awne company and cōpaigniōs.
The capitaynes of the rebelles perceauyng they coulde haue no aide of
y• Kentysh people, puttyng their only hope to their awne powre and fortitude
(for surely they were men of great strength, &amp; of no lesse force then
valiaunt courage) brought theim to Black hethe .iiii. myles frō Londō,
and there in a playne vpon the toppe of an hill they ordred their battailes,
eyther ready to fight with the kyng if he woulde assayle theim, or elles
to assaulte and beate the citee of London: For they thought verely
y• the kyng was so afraied of their puissaunce, y• he minded nothinge
lesse then to encountre with their armie. And therefore beyng enflamed
with arrogancy, nothyng mystrustyng, but fermely beleuynge y• the victory
was sure in their handes, thei determyned to entre into the cytee of
London and to assaute the towre, wherin the kyng (as thei thought) had
pr
                     •
                  uely enclosed hym selfe. But kynge Henry wrought cleane contrary
to their mynde and expectacion, for he neuer thought to geue theim battaile
tyll he had theim farre from their domesticall habitacions and natiue
region, so that they should be out of all hope of aide and comforte.
               And when they were with their long and tedyous iourney weried and
tyred, and that their furye were somewhat assuaged and fell to repentaunce
of their mad commocion and frantike progressiō,

in some place conuenient for his purpose, circumuent &amp; enuyron theim
to his auauntage and their destruccion as he dyd in dede afterward. In
the meane ceason there was great feare thorough the citee &amp; cryes were
made, euery man to harneys, to harneys, some ranne to the gates, other
mounted on the walles, so that no parte was vndefended, and continual
watche was kept by the magestrates of the citee least the rebelles beyng
poore and nedy woulde dissende from their campe and inuade the cytee
and spoyle, and robbe the riches and substaūce of the marchaūtes. But
the kyng deliuered and purged their hartes out of this feare, for after y•
he perceaued that the Cornyshmen were all the daye ready to fight and

Erle of Essex. Edmond de la Poole earle of Suffolke, and sir Ryes

company of archers and horsmen to enuyron the hill on the right syde &amp;
on the left, to thentent ye all hywayes beyng stopped &amp; forclosed, all hope
of flight should be taken from theim: And incontinent, he beyng as well
encouraged with manly stomacke &amp; desire to fight as furnished wt a populous
army &amp; copie of artillery, set forward out of the cytee &amp; encāped
hym selfe in Sainet Georges felde, where he the frydaye at nyght then
lodged.
               On the saturday in the mornynge, he sent the Lorde Dawbeney with
a greate compaignye to set on theim early in the morenyng, which fyrst
gate the bridge at Detforde Strande whiche was manfully defended
by certeyne archers of the rebelles, whose arowes as is reported were in
length a full yarde. While the erles set on theim on euery syde, the lorde
Dawbeney came into the felde with his cōpany, &amp; wtout longe fightyng
the Cornyshmen were ouercome, but first thei tooke the lord Dawbeney
prisoner, &amp; whether it were for feare or for hope of fauoure, they let hym
go at libre

                  y wtout any hurt or detriment. There were slain of y• rebelles
whicht fough &amp; resisted .ii. thousand mē &amp; moo &amp; takē prisoners an infinite
nōbre, &amp; emōgest theim y• black smyth &amp; chiefe capiteins which shortely
after were put to death. This Mighell Ioseph, surnamed y• black
smyth one of ye capiteins of this donge hill &amp; draffe sacked ruffians, was
of such stowte stomack &amp; haute courage, y• at thesame time y• he was drawen
on the herdle toward his death, he sayd (as men do reporte) that for
this myscheuous and facinorous acte, he should haue a name perpetual
and a fame permanēt and immortal. So (you may perceaue) that desire
and ambicious cupidite of vaine glorie and fame, enflameth, and encourageth
aswel poore and meane persones, as y• heartes of great lords
and puyssaunt princes to trauayle &amp; aspire to thesame. Some affirme y•
the kynge appoyncted to fight with the rebelles on the Monday, and
anticipatyng the tyme by pollecie set on theim vpon the Saturday before,
beinge vnprouided and in no arraye of battaile, and so by that pollecy
obteyned the felde and victory.
               When this battaile was ended, the kyng wanted but .iii.C. of all his
company that were slayne at that present conflicte. Also the capiteynes
apprehended &amp; taken he pardoned, sauyng the chiefe capiteynes &amp; firste
aucthors of that mischiefe, to whome he would neither shewe mercy nor
leuyty. For he caused the lord Audeleigh to be drawē from Newgate to
the Towre hil in a cote of his awne armes peinted vpon paper, reuersed
and al to torne, &amp; there to be behedded ye .xxviii. day of Iuyn. And Thomas
Flamock and Myghell Ioseph he commaunded after the fassyō of
treytours to be drawen, hāged and quartred, &amp; their quarters to be pytched
on stakes &amp; set vp in diuerse places of Cornewale, yt their sore punyshemētes
and terrible execucions for their treytorous attemptes and
foolish hardy entreprices, might be a warnyng for other herafter to absteyne
from committyng lyke cryme &amp; offence. But because he was certified
that their countrey men beynge at home in Cornewale were by this

skourge litle mollefied or quieted, &amp; were ready to moue againe and begynne
newe commocions and conspiracies, yf any vngracious or euell
mynded person would eyther moue or pricke theim forwarde, he turned
his purpose and caused theim to be set vp in London and other places,
least that by suche meanes he should wrappe him self in more trouble at
that time when he went aboute with all his witt and councell to represse
and assuage all domesticall and ciuile sedicion, to thentēt that he might
the more seriously and intentifely set forward a puissaunt army agaynst
the braggyng and vnfeithful Scottes, beyng content at that tune, that
fortune had so smyled on his syde.

                  WHile this busines was thus handled in England, the kyng
of Scottes beynge certefied of it by his espialles, and that
there was none army reysed in England either to withstād
his powre or destroye his countrey, and herynge also that
kyng Henry and his nobles were vexed and sore troubled
with the commocion of the Cornyshemen, and in a ciuile discorde and

                  ssencion emongest theim selfes: Wherfore he thought 
                     〈◊〉
                   necessary to
anticipate the warre before hand. For wel he knewe that assone as kyng
Henry had subdued and ouerturned his aduersaries, that he woulde
with his whole puissaunce inuade his realme and dominions: And therfore
he inuaded the frontiers of the realme of Englande wastynge the
countrey, burnyng the tounes and murtheryng the people, sparyng neither
place nor person. And while his light horsemen were ridyng to forrage
and destroye the byshoprick of Dutham and there burned all about,
he with another company went aboute to expugne and assaute the
castell of Norham standyng on the ryuer of Twede, which deuideth England
and Scotland. The byshop of Durham which at that time was
Richard Foxe, had well furnyshed it both with men and municions, vigilantly
forseyng and imagenyng that the Scottish kyng (assone as he
knewe that there was ciuile discorde and vnnatural warre moued wtin
the realme of England,) would with all his powre inuade and harrythe
borders and coūtreyes adioynyng to his land, This Richard Foxe was
before called bishop of Excetter, and for his singuler vertues and great
grauitie was after that made bishop of Bathe and Welles, and last of
all promoted and exalted to the bishoprick of Durham.
               The bishop from tyme to tyme aduertised y• kyng of all thinges that

with many other well proued and warlike men, whiche although in degree
they were not peregall with these great lordes and knyghtes, yet in
manhoode and pollecyes of warre and valiaunte courage, they were to
theim in all feactes equiualent. The nōbre was lytle lesse then .xx. thousand
men, besyde the nauie, wherof the lord Brooke was Admyrall.
               When the Scottes had dyuerse dayes assauted and beaten the
Castell of Norham, to the no lytle detryment and dammage therof, and
coulde make no batrye to entre into thesame, they determined of theyr
awne minde to reyse their siege and returne, and that so muche the soner
because they heard saye that the Earle of Surrey was within .ii. dayes
iourney of theim with a great puissaūce. Wherfore king Iamy thought
yt to small purpose to tary any lenger in besegyng the castell, rcysed his
siege and returned into his awne realme: When the Earle knewe of the
kynges retourne, he folowed after wt all hast possible, trustyng surely to
ouertake him and to geue hym battayle.
               When the erle was entred Scotlande, he prostrated and defaced the
castell of Cawdrestenes. The towre of Hetenhall, The towre of Edington,
The towre of Fuldē: and he sent Norrey kyng at armes to the capiteine
of Hayton Castell, whiche was one of the strongest places betwene
Berwyke and Edynborough, to delyuer him the castell, which he denied
to do, affirming that he was sure of spedy succours and swift aide. The
erle perceauyng the denial, layed his ordinaunce to the castel, and contynually
bet it from two of the clocke till .v. at nyght, in suche wise that
they within rendred vp, the fortresse, their lyues only saued. And when y•
erle had receaued the Scottes, he with his miners rased and ouerthrewe
the castell to the playne grounde. The Scottishe kynge was within a
mile of the siege, and bothe knewe yt and sawe the smoke and yet would
not once set a foote forwarde to saue or reskewe his castel. And while the
Erle laye at Hayton, the kyng of Scottes sent to him Marchemount &amp;
another heraulde, desyryng hym at his eleccion eyther to fight wt whole

puissaunce againste puissaunce, or elles they .ii. to fight person to person
and hand to hand, requyring that if the victory should falle to y• Scottish
kyng, that then the erle shoulde delyuer for his raunsome the towne
of Berwyke, with the Fyshegarthes of thesame. The erle ioyously, lyke
a courageous capiteyne receaued this message and made answere, that
he was ready in the playne felde to abyde the battayle with hys whole
army, praiyng him to come forward with his puissaunce, and after that
he thanked him hartely of the honoure that he offred hym, for surely he
thought hym selfe much honoured that so noble a prince would vouchefaue
to admit so poore an erle to fight wt him body to body, asserteining
hym ferther, yt y• toune of Berwyke was the kyng his masters &amp; not hys
y• which he neyther ought nor woulde laye to pledge nor gagewithout y•
kings assent, but he would put his body in pledge which was more precious
to him then al ye tounes of y• world, promisyng on his honour that
if he toke the kyng prisoner in ye singuler combate, y• he would release to
hym all his parte of his fyne and raunsome, and yf it chaunced the kyng
to vanquishe &amp; apprehende hym, he would pay gladly such a raunsome
as was mete &amp; conuenient for the degree of an erle. And when he had rewarded
&amp; dismissed the herauldes, he set his army in a redines abiding y•
commyng of ye kyng of Scottes and so stoode all daye. But the Scottysh
kyng not regardyng his offres, nor performyng his great crakes &amp;
boastes, beyng afraied to cope wt the Englishe nacion, shamefully &amp; sodeinly
fled in ye night ceason with all his powre &amp; company. When y• erle
knewe yt the kyng was reculed, &amp; had bene in Scotland .vi. or .vii. daies
beyng dayly and nightly vexed with continual wynde &amp; vnmeasurable
teyne, coulde not cause his people to contynue in that tempestious vnfertile
&amp; barayne region, with good aduise retreated agayn wt his whole
army to the toune of Berwyke, &amp; there dispersed his army euery mā into
his countrey, tariyng there him selfe tyll he knewe the pleasure of the
kyng in furtherynge or protractyng the warres of Scotland: But in y•
meane ceason one Peter Hyalas, a man of no lesse learnyng then prudēt
witt and pregnant pollecy, was sent Ambassadour frō Ferdinand kyng
of Speyne vnto the king of Scottes to moue &amp; entreate a peace and an
vnitie to be had betwene him &amp; the kyng of England. For of kyng Ferdinand
and Elyzabeth his wyfe (to which woman none other was comparable
in her tyme) there was nothyng more desyred nor wisshed then
by the coniunccion of mariage betwene Arthure prynce of Wales heyre
apparaunt to kyng Henry, &amp; lady Katheryn the daughter of kyng Ferdynand
and quene Elizabeth a newe affinitee &amp; aliaunce might be knyt
and begonne betwene the realme of England and countrey of Speine.
And also he fauoured somewhat the kyng of Scottes, for whiche cause
he offred him selfe as a meane and mediatour of a peace betwene bothe
the prynces, their territoires and dominions.
               This Peter Hyalas sollicited and moued by all honest meanes &amp; deuyces
kyng Iames to assent to a vnitee &amp; concorde, and when wt longe

solicityng he conceaued some good hope to growe in his weighty busynes,
he wrote vnto the kyng of Englād, that it would please him to send
one of his nobilitie or councel to be associate with him in concludyng wt
the Scottysh kyng. The kyng of England which euer (so yt were not to
his dishonour, hurte or detriment) was not only a louer of peace, but also
a norisher and a furtherer of amity and quietnes, &amp; specially at this
tyme when he was vexed with the ciuile sedicion of his awne propre
shepe and flocke, cōmitted the charge of this weighty matter to Richard
Foxe Bishop of Durham, whiche laye on Thenglish borders in his castell
of Norham. The bisshop accordynge to the kynges appoyntement
went honorably into Scotland, where he and Peter Hyalas at y• towne
of Iedwoorth reasoned with the Scottish commissioners as cōcernyng
this peace to be had. Sixe hundred cōdicions were purposed on the one
parte and theother, but after lōge protractyng of tyme &amp; much debating
and arguyng, not one was accepted nor allowed, And one thinge aboue
all other dashed the whole treatie: For kynge Henry instantly requyred
to haue Perkyn Warbeck the founteyne and chiefe cause of all this tumult
and vnquietnes the perturber of him and his whole realme: But
the kyng of Scottes fermely denyed to cōsent to any article that might
sounde to his reproche or dishonour. And also he nowe beganne to smel
and sauour the iuggelyng &amp; false countrefeatyng of his newe gest Perkyn
Warbeck. Yet because that Perkyn was alied to him by the holy
sacrament of matrimony, he thought yt bothe vnhonest, vnreasonable
&amp; vnnaturall to betrey his alye &amp; deliuer him to death &amp; cōfusiō. Wherfore
when they had reasoned y• matter &amp; diuerse other vrgent &amp; weighty
causes by diuerse daies of metyng, &amp; yt for y• contrarietie of opinions, no
ferme peace could be cōcluded. In steade of peace, a truce was cōcluded
for certeine yeres vpon condiciō y• Iames kyng of Scottes should conuey
Perkyn Warbeck out of his realme, seigniories and dominions.
               While these thinges were reasoned &amp; at ye last cōcluded in the cōfines
of England &amp; Scotlād, kyng Hēry caused y• ambassadoures of y• Frēch
kyng, to be brought to his presence, &amp; he theim receaued wt al benignitee
which as 
                     •
                  t is shewed before were stopped at Douer of their iourney vntyll
such time y• the insurreccion of the Cornish men were suppressed and
extinguished. And with lyke entreteinement he embraced at y• very ceason
y• lord of Camphire and other Orators of Philip archeduke of Austrich
&amp; duke of Burgoyne, cōming to him for y• conclusiō &amp; cōtinuaūce
of an amitie &amp; to haue the English marchaūtes to resorte to their countrey
agayn, which frō thence before were prohibited &amp; forbyddē. Which
request being verie agreable to y• quietnes &amp; tranquilitee of his realme,
&amp; especially at y• time, he dyd fauourably graunte &amp; benyngly assent vnto.
And so beyng confederate &amp; alied by treatie &amp; league wt al his neighbours
marchynge on euery side of his realmes &amp; regions, he gratefied
 wt

whiche was ye yere of our lorde a thousand .iiii.C.lxxxxviii. &amp; y• .xiii. yere

               Iames the kyng of Scottes seynge that he nowe perc

                  aued howe he
was by Perkyn manifestly deluded, accordyng as he had feithfully promised,
so he nowe duly performed it. For he callynge to his presence theforsayde
Perkyn Warbecke, declaryng to hym what benefites &amp; cōmodities
he had receaued of his princely liberalitie &amp; gentlenes, gentely requiring
him to departe oute of y• realme into some other countrey where
he might make his abode more surely and more quietly, vntil such tyme
as fortune woulde prouyde a more prosperous winde to set forwarde y•
sayles of his purpose &amp; desyre, declaryng vnto him y• he cōpelled in maner
by necessitee had cōcluded a league &amp; cōcorde wt y• kyng of Englād,
&amp; by y• treatie, the refuge that he should haue had of him and his coūtrey
was not only to him prohibited and forbidden, but also it was agreed &amp;
condiscended that neither the kyng of Scottes, nor any by his procurement
or in his name should make warre on the king of England, which
warre he gladly tooke in hand for Perkins sake, hauyng sure confidēce
&amp; perfight trust to haue bene aided and assisted wt Perkyns frendes in
England. But when he perceaued y• al was in vayne &amp; yt all his wordes
were but wynd, he exhorted him not to be displeased to departe, least his

                     •
                  ariyng might be to him a detrimēt and a breakyng of ye treatie betwene
hym &amp; kyng Henry lately concluded, wherfore with many fayre wordes
he desyred hym to departe. This Perkyn knowyng the kinges pleasure
was very sore amased, seyng there was no helpe to be loked for herafter
in Scotland. Alb
                     •
                  it remēbryng the great benefites which he had receaued
hertofore of the Scottysh kyng, which he thought him self neuer hable
to requyte and deserue, that he might not seme to hym ingrate or not
wyllynge to folowe his desyre, he was content at his intercession to departe.
And shortly after sayled into Irelād with his wife &amp; family, there
determynyng wt him selfe either to sayle into Flaunders to y• duches of
Burgoyne, or to ioyne and take parte with the Cornyshmen. But howe
so euer it was, while he laye in Ireland doubtyng what to do, he had intelligence
by certeyne messengers that the Cornyshmen for all their disconfiture
and plage not to be appeased, but sore to grudge and murmoure
against kynge Henry, and that thei were prone and ready to renue
the warre agayne the kynge and the prynce: Where he not entendyng
to forsake so faire an occasion so manifestly offred, he hauing with
him .iiii. smal shippes &amp; not aboue .vi. skore men, sayled into Cornewale
and there landed in the moneth of September and came to a toune called

Bodman, and there dyd so sollicite, prouoke and stirre the mutable &amp;
wa
                     •
                  eryng people, what with fayre woordes and large promises that he
gathered to hym aboue thre thousand persones whyche immediately
called hym their capiteyne, and sayde that thei would take his part and
folowe hym to the death, and in al thinges obey his preceptes and commaundementes.
               Then Perkyn was well encouraged and made proclamacions in the
name of kyng Richard the .iiii. as sonne to kyng Edward that last died.
And by the aduise of his .iii. councellers. Ihon Heron mercer a banquerupt,
Richard Scelton a tayler and Ihon Asteley a Skreuener, men
of more dishonestie then of honest estimacion, determyned first of all to
assaulte and beate all walled and stronge townes and fortresses, and
theim to receaue into his possession and seignyorie for his farther securitee
and defence: And that entreprice acheued, then he woulde augmēt
his hoost and marche forwarde against all persones that durst once offre
theim selfes to withstand hym.
               When he and his imprudent counsayll were fully resolued on this
poincte and conclusion, they in good ordre went streight to Excetrer,
which was the next citee that he coulde approche to, and beseged yt, and
because he lacked ordinaūce to make a battrye to rase &amp; deface y• walles
he studied all the weyes possible how to breake and infrynge the gates,
and what with castyng of stones, heuyng with yron barres &amp; kyndeling
of fier vnder the gates, he omitted nothyng yt could be deuised for y• furtheraunce
of his vngracious purpose. The cytezens perceauynge their
towne to be 
                     •
                  nuyronned with enemies and lyke to be enflamed, beganne
at y• first to be sore abashed, and let certeyn messengers by cordes downe
ouer the walle which should certefie y• kyng of al their necessitee &amp; trouble.
But after that, takyng to theim lusty heartes and manly courages
thei determined to repulse fyer by fier, &amp; caused faggottes to be brought
to y• inward part of the portes and posternes and set theim all on fier, to
thentent y• the fier beyng enflamed on both the sydes of the gates, might
aswel exclude their enemies from entryng, as include y• citezens frō ronnyng
or fliyng out, and y• thei in the meane ceason might make trenches
and rāpayres to defende their enemies in stede of gates and Bulwerkes
Thus all the doynges and attemptes of the rebellious people had euell
successe in their first entreprice: And thus by fyer the citee was preserued
from flame and burnynge. Then Perkyn beyng of very necessitee compelled
to leaue the gates, assaulted y• toune in diuerse weake and vnfortefied
places, and set vp laders, attempting to clime ouer the walles and
to take the cytee, thinkyng suerly to compell the cytezens either by feare
or lacke of succoure to rendre theim selfes and yelde the toune. But the
cytezens nothing so mynded, so courageously lyke valaūt chāpions defended
y• walles, that they slewe aboue .ii.C. of his sedicious souldiours
at this assaute.
               Assone as the messengers of Excetter came to the kyngs presence and

shewed their instruccions, he hasted with his hoost towarde Excetter wt
asmuch hast as the grauitie of the cause did requyre &amp; expostulate. And
sent the lord Daw
                     •
                  eney with light horsmen before to certefie all men of
his commyng at hand▪ But in the meane ceason lord Edward Corteney

                     •
                  hire &amp; lord William his sonne, a man of great force &amp; valiantnes,
accompanied with Sir Edmond Carewe, sir Thomas Trenchard,
sir William Courteney, sir Thomas Fulforde, sir Ihon Halewel,
sir Ihō Croker, Water Courteney, Peter Egecōbe, Williā Sētuaure,
with all spede came into the cytee of Excetter and holpe the citezens, and
at the last assaute the Erle was hurte in the arme with an arowe, and so
were many of his company, but very fewe slayne.
               When Perkyn with his lewde capiteyns sawe y• the citee of Excetter
was so well fortefied bothe with men and municions, and of theim in
maner impregnable, fearynge the sequele of this matter, departed from
Excetter with his lowsy army to the next great toune called Tawnton,
and there the .xx. daye of September he mustered his men as though he
were ready to fight, but his nōber was sore minished. For when the 
                     •
                  ore
and nedy people sawe the great defence whiche was made at Excetter, &amp;
that no men of honour nor yet of honestie drewe to hym, contrary to the
promes and assuraunce made by hym and his coūcelers to theim at the
begynnyng, they with drewe theim selfes by sondry secret compaignyes
from him, in prouidyng their awne sauegarde. Which thinge when Perkyn
perceaued, he put small trust and lesse confidence in the remnant of
his army, as afterward dyd appere, because the moost parte of his souldioures
were harnessed on the right arme and naked all the body, and
neuer exercised in warre nor marciall feates but only with the spade and
shouell.
               When the kynge heard he was gone to Tawnton, he hastened after
him with al spede. Thether came to the kyng Edward duke of Buckyngham,
a younge prince of a greate courage and of a synguler good witt,
and him folowed a great compaignie of noble men, knightes &amp; Esquyers,
prepared and redy with all thinges necessary for the felde and battayle.
Emongest which nomber was sir Alexāder Baynam, Sir Mawrice
Berkeley, Sir Robert Tame, Sir Ihon Guyse, Sir Robert Poyntz,
sir Hēry Uernon, Sir Ihon Mortimer, Sir Thomas Tremayle,
Sir Edward Sutton, Sir Amise Pawlett, Sir Ihon Byckenel, Sir
Ihon Sapcotes, Sir Hugh Lutterell, Sir Fraunces Cheyney and
many other knyghtes, esquyers and valyaunte personages. When the
kynge approched nere to the toune of Tawnton, whether the woulde not
de
                     •
                  erre and put of the battayle, or whether he doubtynge the turne
of fortunes whele, sent before hym Robert lord Brooke lord Stuarde
of his house, Gyles lord Dawbeney his chiefe chamberlayn, and Sir
Rice app Thomas, to set on his enemies and begynne the battaile, &amp; he
with his powre folowed, to thentent that when the armies couped &amp; ioyned
together, he either should wt newe succours refreshe his awne army

or elles set on the backe of his enemies or they coulde espie hym. Albey
                     •
                  
the kyng had no great nede to vse suche pollecy yf he had knowen what
sequele had ensued. For assone as Perkyn was enformed y• his enemies
were ready to geue him battayle, he that nothynge lesse mynded then to
fight in open felde with the kynges puissaunce, dissimuled all y• day time
 wt his company▪ as though nothyng coulde make him afeard, &amp; aboute
mydnight beyng accompanyed with .lx. horsmen departed frō Tawnton
in poste to a sanctuary toune besyde Southhampton called Beaud
                     •
                  ley,
&amp; there he &amp; Ihon Heron &amp; other registred theim selfes as persones priuileged.
But whether Perkyn dyd this for feare, least his men shoulde
forsake hym, or for the cowardenes of his awne tymorous courage, it is
asmuch vncerteyne, as it is probable &amp; sure that the kynge tooke by hys
flight greate commoditee &amp; quietnes, by reason y• he was not enforced to
fight with y• Cornysh men, whose hart
                     •
                  s and courages were so encreased
&amp; inflamed by deadly desperacion that they earnestly determined &amp; were
stedfastly bent either to winne victory &amp; ouercome their enemies or 
                     •
                  lles
not one of theim all to lyue any daye or houre lenger
               When kyng Henry knew y• Perkyn was fled &amp; departed he sent after
him y• lord Dawbeney wt .v.C. horsmē toward y• see side to intercept him
before he should come there. But Perkin whome y• matter touched at y•
quick, made such haste with the swiftnes of his horse &amp; sharpenes of his
spurres that he was so farre passed on his way before, y• no person could
tell tydynges of him, before he regestred and disclosed hym self in the
sanc
                     •
                  uarye. But hys chiefe Capiteines whiche fled, coulde not so craftely
escape, for the moost parte of theim were apprehended, &amp; as capitues
and wretches, miserably presented to the kynge. When the resydewe of
the common people could neyther see Perkyn nor yet the standards nor
guyd
                     •
                  homes of their capiteynes, not knowynge where he was become,
doubtyng whether he were fraudulently slayn or fearfully fled, wist not
what councell to aske or what waye was moost surest to folowe &amp; take.
But when thei were asserteined of his moost shamefull flight, euery person
oppressed with this common mischiefe, common feare, and common
perell, castyng awaye their armure, submitted theim selfes to the kyng,
holdyng vp their handes in askyng mercy, offeryng &amp; promisynge hym,
faythe, loyaltie and obeysaunce. To whome the kynge of moost gentle
heart and leuytee, not only graunted perdon but receaued theim to hys
fauoure. And so the kynge b
                     •
                  ynge a conquerour withoute manslaughter
or effusion christen of blood roade triumphantly into the cytee of
Excetter, and there not only lauded &amp; preised the cytezēs of Excetter, but
also rēdred to theim his moost hartie thākes, aswell for their duety done
as for their valiauntnes. And there also he afflicted and put in execusyō
diuerse Cornishmen which were the aucthoures and sturrers vp of this
newe insurreccion and false conspiracy.
               The horsmen yt were sent, wtout any stoppe or obstacle in shorte space
came to saint Mighelles mounte, &amp; there (as chaunce was) founde lady

Katheryn Gorden wife to Perkyn and brought her streight lyke a bondewoman
&amp; captyue to the kyng. And the kyng wonderyng at her beautie
and amyable countenaunce thought her a praye more mete for the
chiefe capitaine then for the meane souldioures, beganne then a lytle to
phantasie her person and sent her incontinently accompanied wt a goodly
sorte of sad 
                     •
                  atrones and gentlewomē (because she was but a yoūge
woman) to London to the quene as a true and vndoubted token of hys
triumphe &amp; victory. And while he reposed hym selfe at Excetter, he iudged
that he had nothyng wonne, nor yet plucked vp by the roote of this
sedicious rebellion, excepte he coulde get into his possession the chiefe
h
                     •
                  d and type of this pestiferous faccion and busynes. Wherfore he enuyroned
the sanctuary whiche Perkyn was in, rounde aboute with .ii.
compaignies of light horsemen, well wytted and vigelant persons, to
thentent to bereue and plucke from Perkyn all hope of flight and 
                     ••
                  capynge
awaye. And after that, he attempted this younge foundelyng by
trusty and polletique messengers, yf he hauyng perdon and remission of
all mischeuous and heinous offences by him done against the kyng and
his realme, woulde gladly submyt hym selfe to the kynge and be to hym
feithfull true and obedient. Perkyn beynge nowe destitute of all hope,
faylynge of his dwellynge place, and lacking comforte, aide and refuge
considerynge that he was nowe brought to the verie poyncte and pricke
of extremytee that he wist not whether nor howe to fly into any countrey
for succour, and also he was in vttre despayre to haue herafter any prosperous
chaunce or fortunate successe in his enterprice, because he had so
often attempted and so many times had been defoyled and vanquished,
wherefore he hauyng his perdon to hym offred, and trustynge to the opē
promes of mē, of his awne will franckly and frely departed out of sanctuary
and committed hym selfe to the kynges pleasure, &amp; of by this meanes
this great heate was quenched and appeased.
               Then was the kyng verey glad that this warre was ended, and toke
his iourney imediatly towarde London, not withoute a great concurse
of people metynge hym oute of euery quarter to see this Perkyn as he
were a Monstre, because he beynge an alien of no abilitee by his poore
parentes (although yt was other wise talked and dissimuled) durst once
inuade so noble a realme, and yt to infecte with suche lyes and lesynges,
and chiefly of al that he by his crafty subornacions had persuaded
diuerse aswell noble as ignoble (not without the cōfusion and vndoyng
of many of theim) to beleue and saye that he was thesame verey person
that he feigned and peynted hym selfe to bee. But when the kynge was
come to London, he appoyncted certeyne kepers to attende on him whiche
shoulde not (the breadth of a nayle) go from his person, to thentent
that he mighte neyther conueigh hym selfe oute of the land, nor flye any
whether, nor yet prouoked and procured by other shoulde be hable to
so we agayne no newe sedicion nor sedicious tumult within his realme &amp;
countreyes.
               
                  When these tidynges came to the lady Margarete in Flaūders that
Perkin her dere darlyng had no good lucke but losse, bothe of his entreprice
and her great studious furtheraunce, and was brought into captiuitee,
she was not well pleased with theim, but wepte and lamented hys
vnlucky spede, and cursed her infortunate chaunce.
               When these thinges were brought to passe accordynge to the kynges
mynde, he dyd not forget that there was no more a delectable and pleasaunt
thinge, nor a larger reyne of mischiefe geuen to y• vulgare people,
then to haue a sure hope and trust that thei maye offende wtout any punishment
or corr

                  ccion: Wherfore to thentēt herafter to obserue his people
in a dewe obeysaunce &amp; filiall subieccion, he shortly caused inquyries
to be made of diuerse offences. Wherupon diuerse persones aswel in so
merset shire as deuonshire were accused and presented y• they had aided
both wt mē &amp; mony y• Cornysh treytours, not only after their dis

was thus: Certeine young men of y• Scottes came armed vnto Norhā
castel &amp; behelde it wōderous circumspectly▪ as though thei had bene desyrous
to knowe what was done there wtin: But when y• kepers of y• castel

                  e any questiō to theim nor once to stirre oute. But whē thei came
agayn y• next daye &amp; viewed it likewyse, the kepers of thesaide castel suspectynge
some fraude to lurcke in their lookynge, demaunded of theim
what was their entent, &amp; why they vewed and aduised so the castel. The
Scottes euen like theim selfes, aunswered theim proudly and rustically

with many disdeynfull woordes. Insomuch that after their blusteryng
and blowyng aunswers made, Thenglishmen beyng vexed and moued
ther with al, replied to theim with hard &amp; manly strokes, and after many
a sore blowe geuen and taken on both partes, &amp; diuerse Scottes wounded
&amp; some slayne, the Scottes oppressed wt the multitude of Thenglish
people, fled as fast as their horses would carye theim. When they came
home and certified the kyng of thesame, he was therewith sore moued &amp;
&amp; angry, and sware by swete sainct Ninyan y• there was nothyng to him
more inconstant and vnstedfast then the obseruyng of the league by the

                  es
and vexacions euen from his infancye drawen and exercised in, made
hym aunswere that it was not done through his defaulte, neither by his
councell nor knowledge, but rather by the temerarious folly of y• kepers
of the castell, requyrynge him for that cause not to thinke the league infringed,
promisyng in the woorde of a kyng to enquyer of the truth and
who were the malefactoures. And if y• offence were founde to be begōne
on the partie of the kepers of the castell, he assured hym that they should
for no mede or fauoure eskape peyne &amp; punishement. This aunswere although
it were more then reasonable, could not mittigate or assuage the
the Scottes angre and outrageousnes, for the which cause, Rycharde
bishop of Durham, which was more heauy then all other because that
this discorde was renued agayne betwene these twoo prynces by occasion
of Castell kepers, he therfore thought yt best first to assuage and
coole the furious rage of the Skottyshe kynge, and wrote many letters
to hym, requyrynge hym of peace and vnitie. The kynge perceauynge
bothe the good will and constant grauytie of the bishop, appeased
his fury and aunswered gentely to the bishops letters by writynge
agayne to hym, saiyng that because he had many secret and preuy thinges
in his mynde which he would communicate only with him touching
the cause nowe in variaunce, he therfore requyred hym to take peyne to
come into his countrey, trustyng that he should thynke his labour well
bestowed. The byshop was very glad and sent woorde to the kynge his
master, of kyng Iames desyre, who estemed the request and cause bothe
iust and reasonable, and therfore willed hym to accomplishe ye Scottish
kynges honest desyre.
               When he came into Scotland, he was receaued with all humanitee
that coulde be thought of the kyng him selfe at an Abbey called Mellrose.
And there, after that the kynge for a countenaunce had complayned
muche of the crueltie and s
                     •
                  aughter that was vsed towardes hys
men late at Norham, he 
                     •
                  asely remitted the offence and perdoned

it, and began secretly to cōmen without any witnesses or arbitters nere
hand with the bishop alone. And first declared to him what olde &amp; 
                     •
                  uste
causes haue moued him before this, to seke al
                     •
                  aūce &amp; amitie with kyng
Henry, whiche now he desyred muche more to haue confirmed &amp; cor
                     •
                  oborate
for the farther mayntenaunce of loue and encrease of frendship,
which thing he doubted not, but shoulde sorte to a 
                     •
                  ortunate effect and
good cōclusion, if ye kyng of England would vouchsafe to geue to him
in matrimony his first begottē daughter y• lady Margaret, vpō which
point he determined not lōg agone to sende his Amba
                     •
                  sadors into Englād,
which thing he would the soner do if he knew this bishops mynd
&amp; entēt ready to further his louing purpose. The bishop aūswered but
fewe wordes, sauing y• when he were returned to the king his master, he
would do the best in ye matter yt laye in his powre. Which wordes animated
much the kyng, &amp; put him in good hope to sende his oratours to
the kyng of England to sue for thesaide matrimony to be concluded.
               When the bishop had taken his leaue, &amp; was come to the king▪ he declared
to him in ordre all the cōmunicaciō betwene king Iames &amp; him.
This request pleased the king very much, to whome peace was euer a
souereygn cordiall, and determined su
                     •
                  ely to minister o
                     •
                  casiō of warre
to no man, nor woulde haue any prynce to prouoke hym to thesame.
               Now began the fatall daye of the death of Perkyn Warbeck, &amp; Edward
erle of Warwicke to approche: For after this facte done &amp; cōmitted,
one fierce &amp; strōg waue deuoured &amp; swalowed both their lyues not
long asonder, as you shal heare by ye cōtinuaci
                     •
                   of this story. Perkyn,
whether it greued him to be kept inwarde, or els that he was ins
                     •
                  igated
&amp; en
                     •
                  ised by some of his olde frēdes to sturre more coles, &amp; begin some
new sedicious facciō, or at the least, because he woulde wilfully wast &amp;
cast away him selfe, studied how to escape &amp; flye away, hauing perfight
hope y• he should fynd occasiō to bring al thi
                     •
                  ges wel to passe, if he could
cōueigh him selfe once out of the Englishmens handes. And although
he were not ignoraūt, that he neither coulde do nor ymagyn any thing
but the kyng woulde bothe heare of it and knowe it: Yet he seduced wt
hope of euasion and skapyng, whiche was the chiefe cōforte of his captiuitie,
had leuer put all thinges in a profe &amp; hasarde, rather then lēger
to tollerate and suffre the present calamyte and dayly misery. And
so deceauyng his kepers toke him to his heeles, by y• which he brought
him selfe into a streyghter custody and pryson, and wrapped him selfe
into tortures and punyshmentes: For when he came to the sea coastes,
and had gone but a litle forwarde on his iourney, when the rumour of
his flight was spreade abroade, euery byway and lane was set abroade
with the kinges garde, which had y• custody of his body. Wherefore he
beyng sore abashed wtthe clamour of them that searched and made inquyrie
for him, &amp; beyng in maner destitute of wit &amp; counsail, altered of
necessite frō his pretensed iourney, &amp; came to the house of Bethlem, called
ye priory of Shene beside Rychemōd in Southrey, &amp; cōmitted him

sel
                     •
                  e to the pryor of ye monastery, requyring him for Godssake to aske
and desire his life and perdō of the kynges maiestie. The pryor, which
for hys verteous qualities was had in great estimacion, moued with y•
calamytie and infortunate state of thys man, came to the kynge &amp; shewed
hym of this Perkyn, whose perdon he humbly craued, &amp; franckely
obteyned it. Incontinent after thys, Perkyn was brought to the court
agayne to Westmynster with many a curse and reproche, and was one
daye set fettered in a payre of stockes, before the dore of Westmynster
hall, and there stoode an whole daye, not without innumerable reproches
mockes &amp; skorninges. And y• next day was caryed thorough London,
&amp; set vpon a lyke skaffolde in Chepe by the stādard, with like gynnes
and stockes as he occupyed the daye before, and there stode al daye
and red openly his awne confession written with hys awne hande, the
very copy wherof hereafter ensueth.
               First it is to be knowen, that I was borne in the toune of Turney in
Flaunders, &amp; my fathers name is Ihon Os
                     •
                  eck, which sayd Ihon Osbeck
was cōptroller of thesayde toune of Turney, &amp; my mothers name
is Katheryn de Faro. And one of my grauntsires vpon my fathers side
was named Diryck Osbeck which dyed, after whose death my grauntmother
was maryed vnto the withinnamed Peter flāme, y• was receauer
of the forenamed toune of Turney, &amp; Deane of the botemen y• towe
vpon the water or Ryuer, called Leschelde. And my graūtsire vpon my
mothers side was Peter de Faro, whiche had in hys kepyng ye keyes of
the gate of sainct Ihons wtin thesame toune of Turney. Also I had an
vncle called master Ihon Stalyn, dwelling in y• parish of sainct Pyas
within thesame toune, which had maried my fathers suster, whose name
was Ione or Iane, with whome I dwelled a certain ceasō. And afterward
I was led by my mother to Andwerp for to learne Flēmishe, in a
house of a cousyn of myne, an officier of thesaid toune, called Ihō Stiē
beck, wt whom I was y• space of halfe a yere. And after y• I returned agayn
to Turney, by reason of y• warres y• were in Flaūders. And wtin a
yere folowing I was sent wt a merchaūt of y• sayd toune of Turney named
Berlo, and his Masters name Alexāder, to the marte of Andwarpe
where I fell sycke, whiche sickenes contynued vpon fyue monethes.
               And thesayde Barlo set me to boorde in a skynners house that dwelled
besyde the house of the Englishe nacion. And by hym I was from
thence caryed to Barowe marte, and I lodged at the signe of the olde
man, where I abode the space of twoo monethes. And after this the
sayde Barlo set me with a merchaunt of Middelboroughe too seruyce,
for to learne the language, whose name was Ihon Strewe, with whom
I dwelled frome Christmas tyll Easter, and then I went into Portyngale,
in the companye of Syr Edwarde Bramptones wyfe, in a
shyppe whyche was called the quenes shippe. And when I was
come thether, then I was put in seruyce to a knyghte that dwelled in
Lushborne, whiche was called Peter Ua
                     •
                  z de cogna, with whome I

I dwelled an whole yere, whiche sayde knyght had but one eye. And
because I desyred to see other countryes, I toke lycence of hym, &amp; then
I put my selfe in seruice with a Bryton, called Pregent Meno, y• which
brought me with him into Ireland, and when we were there arriued in
the toune of Corke, they of y• toune, because I was arayed with some
clothes of sylke of my sayde maistres, came vnto me &amp; threped vpō me
y• I should be ye duke of Clarēce sonne y• was before tyme at Deuelyn.
And forasmuch as I denied it, there was brought vnto me ye holy euā
                  gelist
&amp; the Crosse by ye Mayre of the toune, which was called Ihon le
Wellen, &amp; there in ye presence of him &amp; other I toke myne othe as ye truth
was, y• I was not the foresaid dukes sonne, nor none of hys blood. And
after this came vnto me an Englisheman, whose name was Stephen
Poytron, wt one Ihon water, &amp; laide to me in swearing great othes that
they knew wel y• I was kynge Rychardes bastard sonne: To whom I
aūswered with like othes y• I was not. And then they aduysed me not
to be a fearde, but y• I should take it vpō me boldely, and if I woulde
so do, they would aide &amp; assist me wt all their powre against the kyng of
England, &amp; not only they, but they were assured well y• the erles of Desmōd
&amp; Kyldare should do thesame. For thei forced not what party thei
toke, so yt they might be reuēged vpō the kyng of Englād, &amp; so against
my will made me to learne English, &amp; taught me what I shoulde do &amp;
saye. And after this they called me duke of Yorke, secōd sonne of kynge
Edward y• .iiij. because king Rychardes bastard sonne was in ye hādes
of the king of Englād. And vpō this ye said Ihō water, Stephyn Poytron,
Ihon Tyler, Hughbert Burghe with many other, as the forsayd
Erles, entred into this false quarell. And within shorte tyme after, the
French kyng sent an Ambassadour into Ireland, whose name was loyte
Lucas, &amp; master Stephyn Fryā, to aduertise me to come into Fraūce.
And thēce I wēt into Fraūce, &amp; frō thēce into Flaūders, &amp; frō Flaūders
into Ireland, &amp; from Ireland into Scotland, and so into England.
               When night of thesame daye, which was the .xv. day of Iuyne was
come (partely because the kyng had perdoned him his life, &amp; partely because
he should no more ronne awaye, and put the king in doubt of any
mistrust or misfortune to come) he was cōmitted to the Towre of Lōdō,
where hys wickednes boylinge so hoate within hys cancarde stomacke
woulde not suffre hym to escape the punishment &amp; vengeaunce of God,
but shortely after was moost iustly and worthely put to death, as hereafter
shalbe shewed.
            
            
               The xv. yere.
               
                  EDward Plantagenet erle of Warwike, of whome ye haue
heard before, beyng kept in the Towre almost frō his tender
age, that is to saye, frō his first yere of the kyng to thys
xv. yere, out of al cōpany of mē &amp; sight of beastes, ī so much
that he coulde not decerne a Goose from a Capon. And

where as he by cōmen reason &amp; open apparaūce, could not by his awne
doynges seke his death &amp; destrucciō, yet by y• dryft &amp; offence of another
man, he was brought to his ende &amp; cōfusiō. For a freer Augustyn on y•
border of Suffolke called Patricke, to thentent to bring this erle into
dis
                     •
                  ayn &amp; hatred, had a certain skoler called Raufe Wiltord, whome he
greatly fauoured, &amp; in whose hed he euer distilled &amp; enfused this folishe
&amp; fātastical cōceipte, y• if he would folow his coūsail &amp; aduise, he would
casely cōuey him to y• kingdome of Englād. The skoler like a good disciple,
did not denye to folow his masters discipline &amp; coūsail, but more &amp;
more desired &amp; put his master in remēbraūce to performe &amp; accōplish wt
all spede, y• thing which of his awn liberalite, he before had to him both
promised &amp; assured, saiyng, what Mecocke or dastard is so sore afearde
of trāsgressing ye law, or tymerous of punishmēt, y• which for to obteine
a kingdō wil not attēpt to do, &amp; suffre all thinges y• be possible to be assayed
&amp; tasted? So y• whē thei betwene thē selfes secretly had takē a crafty
deliberaciō &amp; coūsailed of their enterprice, &amp; had deuised in their folish
wittes, how it should be brought to passe, they wēt both together in
to Kent (which countrey in auncient tyme hath not bene dul in settinge
foorth of newe phantastical fantasyes) and there beganne this younge
mawmet to tel preuely to many that he was the very erle of Warwike,
and lately gotten oute of the Towre, by y• helpe of thys freer Patricke.
To the whiche saiynges when the freer perceaued hope to be geuen, he
declared it openly in the pulpet, and desyred all men of helpe.
               But the head of thys sedicion was sommer topped, that it coulde
haue no tyme to sprynge any higher, the Master and the skoler beyng
bothe apprehended and caste into pryson, and attaynted. Of the
whiche twoo, the skoler was hanged on Shrouetuesdaye, at sayncte
Thomas waterynges, and the freer was condempned to perpetuall
pryson and captiuitie. For at that tyme here in Englande, so muche
reuerence was attributed to the holy orders, that to a priest, althoughe
he had committed hygh treason agaynste hys souereygne lorde and to
all other, offenders in murder, rape or theft, which had receaued any of
the .iii. higher holy orders, the lyfe was geuen, and the punyshmente of
death released. The chief cause of thys fauoure was this, because Bisshoppes
of a longe tyme and ceason dyd not take knowlege, nor intermit
them selues with the serche and punyshment of suche heynous and
detestable offences, by reason whereof they did not disgrade and depryue
from the holy orders suche malefactours and wycked persones,
whiche without that ceremony, by the canonicall lawe coulde not be
put to deathe. Furthermore, what shoulde a man saye, it was also
vsed that he that coulde but onely reade (ye althoughe he vnderstode
not what he redde) howe heynous or detestable a cryme soo euer he had
committed (treason onely except) shoulde likewise as affines and alyes
to the holy orders be saued, and committed to the Bishoppes pryson.
               
                  And to thentent that if they should escape, and be agayne taken, cōmitting
lyke offence, that their lyues should be no more to them perdoned,
it was ordeyned that murtherers should be brent on the brawne of the
left hande with an hote Iron signed with this lettre M, and theues in
thesame place wt this lettre T, So yt if they, which were once signed wt
any of these markes or tokens did reiterate like cryme &amp; offence again.
should suffre the paynes &amp; punishmentes, which they had both merited
and deserued. Which deuise was enacted &amp; established in ye Parliamēt
kept in the .ii. yere of this kynges reigne, &amp; taken as I cōiecture of the
Frenche naciō, which are wonte, if they take any such offender, to cut of
one of his eares, as a sure token &amp; marke hereafter of hys euell doyng.
And the charge of kepyng such offenders, that be onely imprisoned by
their offences, because it soundeth to spirituall religion is committed
to the bishops &amp; rulers of the spiritualtie, with a penalitee set vpon thē
if any such prisoner do afterward escape. The whiche acte &amp; priuilege
did norish &amp; encreace aboūdantly the 
                     〈◊〉
                   &amp; swarme of theues &amp; murtherers,
for after y• tyme there were an hūdred wayes practised &amp; inuented
how at one time or another, to deliuer or conuey thē out of pryson and
captiuite, by makīg their purgaciō (by what sleight &amp; meanes thei care
not) of such offences as before they were conuinced and founde gyltye,
if no man be present to laye excepcions to thesame. For if the partie offended
and hurte be absent at the day of the purgaciō making, the thefe
or murderer truly founde gilty from the beginning, shall be both excused
&amp; set at libertie. And oftentymes the soner, because the bishop would
not lese so great a summe as an hūdred poūde, for the escape of a poore
knaue, skant woorth a dandyprat: But nowe to returne to oure mater
agayne.
               Perkyn (of whome rehersall was made before) beyng nowe in holde,
coulde not leaue with the destruccion of him selfe, and cōfusiō of other
that had associate thē selfes with him, but begā now to study which wai
to flye &amp; escape. For he by false persuasions and liberall promises, corrupted
Strangweyes, Blewet, Astwood and long Rogier hys kepers,
beynge seruauntes to syr Ihon Dygby lieutenaunt. In so muche that
they (as it was at their araynmēt openly proued) entēded to haue slayn
thesayde Master, and to haue set Perkyn and the erle of Warwyke at
large, which erle was by them made preuy of this enterprice, &amp; therunto
(as all naturall creatures loue libertie) to hys destruccion assented,
               But this craftie deuice and subtil imaginacion, beyng opened and disclosed,
sorted to none effect, and so he beyng repulsed and put backe frō
all hope and good lucke wyth all hys complices and confederates, and
Ihon Awater, sometyme Mayre of Corffe in Irelande, one of hys foū
                  ders,
and hys sonne, were the sixten daye of Nouembre arreyned and
condempned at Westmynster. And on the three &amp; twenty daye of
thesame moneth, Perkyn and Ihon Awater were drawen to Tyborne,
and there Perkyn standyng on a litle skaffolde, redde hys confession,

whiche before you haue heard, and toke it on hys death to be true, and
so he and Ihon Awater asked the kyng forgeuenes and dyed paciētly.
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                  
This was the rewarde of the pernicius Alye and coment of Perkyn
Warbeck, whiche as in his life with false persuasions and vntrew surmises
had broughte many noble personages to death and vtter perdicion
so at his death he brought with him other of thesame sorte to their
not vndeserued ponyshment. And emōgest other Edward erle of Warwicke,
whiche as the fame went, consented to breake pryson, and to departe
out of the realme with Perkyn (which in prysoners is high treason)
was the .xxi. daye of thesayde moneth arreygned at Westmynster
before the erle of Oxforde, then high Constable of England, of thesaide

                     •
                  reason▪ whiche whether it were by the enticemēt of other or of his awne
frewill (many men doubte, because of hys innocency) confessed the fact
and submitted hym selfe to the kynges mercy. And vpon hys confession
he had his indgement▪ and accordyng therunto, the .xxviii. daye of Nouembre
.M.cccc.xcix. was brought to the skaffolde on the Towre hill,
and there behedded. The fame after hys death sprange abroade, y• Ferdinand
kyng of Spayne woulde neuer make full conclusiō of the matrimony
to be had betwene prynce Arthur and the lady Katheryn hys
daughter, nor sende her into England aslonge as this erle lyued. For
he imagened that as longe as any erle of Warwicke lyued, that England
should neuer be clensed or purged of Cyuyle warre and preuy sedicion,
so muche was the name of Warwyke in other regions, had in
feare and gealousy.
               The next yere after there was a great plague,A great death whereof men dyed in
many places very sore, but specially and moost of all in the citie of Lō
                  don,
where dyed in that yere thirty thousand. Also in this yere was burned
a place of the kynges called the maner of Shene Situate, &amp; liynge
nygh the Thamys side, which he after buylded agayne sumpteously &amp;
co
                     ••
                  ly▪ and chaunged the name of Shene, and called it Rychemond, because
hys father and he were erles of Richemonde. The kynge perceauynge
this plague and contagious disease, rather to encrease then
diserease, whether it was to aduoyde the occasion of the sicknes, or to
allure the archeduke Philip of Burgoyne to commē with hym, he personally
toke his ship at Douer, in the beginninge of May, and sayled
to Caleys, to thentent to prouide and see the watches, whiche haue bene
accustomed to be diligently kepte and maynteyned agaynst the incursiōs
of his aduersaries, &amp; there he made polletique ordinaūces &amp; streyte
lawes. While the kyng laye thus at Caleys, the archeduke Philip sent
to him diuerse notable personages, not alonely to gratefie and welcome
hym into those partes, but also to declare that thesayde Archeduke offred
to repaire personally to his presence, with suche a numbre as the
kynge shoulde appoynt, so that it were within no walled toune or fortresse.
For he had before diuerse tynnes made denyall to the Frenche
kyng to entre into any of his walled tounes, &amp; if he should as he gladly

woulde come to the toune of Caleys, it might be a president to ye Frēch
kynge to desyre like meting, what chaunce therof might fall, euery mā
coulde not iudge. The kynge gentely entreteyned the Ambassadours,
but more thankefully accepted the Archedukes offre, and so appoynted
the place at sainct Peters churche without Caleys. Upon the Tuesday
in Pentecost weke, the Archeduke came thether with a conuenient cō
                  pany.
The kyng and the quene with many a lusty lorde and lady rode
thether to welcome hym. And when the kynge approched, the duke at
his lightnynge offred to holde his styrope, whiche the kyng in no wise
would suffre to be done. When the kyng was dissended from his horsse
he and the Archeduke embraced eache other with moost princely familiaritie,
and then the quene and all the nobles saluted hym. What banquettynge,
what myrthe and what passe tyme there was I passe ouer.
But to conclude, there was communicacion of mariages, treatynge of
farther corroboracion of leagues, requestes of tolles in Flaunders to
be mynished, with many other thinges, touchynge thentreprice &amp; traffique
of bothe their realmes. And when all thinges were set in an ordre,
the two princes louingly, toke their leaue and departed, the king to Caleys,
and the Archeduke to saynct Omers.
               After this departing, the Frenche kyng Lewes the .xii. sent to visite
the kynge, the lorde Gronthouse gouernoure of Picardy, and the lorde
Merneiliers, bayly of Amyas, whiche declared to the kyng the getting
of Millayn, and takyng of the duke, whiche lordes were highly feasted
and with great rewardes departed.
            
            
               ¶The .xvi. yere.
               
                  SOne after when this plague was slaked, the kyng returned
agayn to England, about the ende of Iune: And beynge
come into England, sone after there came to him one
Gasper Pous a Spanyard (bothe for learning and good
behaueour very excellent) sent from Alexander bishop of
Rome,A yere of Iubile. whiche should shewe the Englishmen the right waye to heauen.
Therfore that yere was called the yere of Iubile, whiche was the yere
of our Lorde a thousand fyue hundred. And to thentēt that the people
of farre countries might be cased of their laboure and traueyle in commyng
thether, the charitable father sent hys legates into euery country
to destribute the heauenly grace (as he called it) to all Christen people,
whiche either letted by warre, enemyes, infirmitie, weaknes or tediousnes
of the longe iourney, were not hable to performe their iourney to y•
holy cytie of Rome. But thys beneuolent liberlitie was not francke &amp;
frely geuen: For the holy bishop Alexander, with helping and lokynge
to the health of mennes soules, thought somewhat to do for hys awne
priuate commoditie and singuler wealth, and therfore he limitted and
set a certayne pryce of this hys grace &amp; pardon: &amp; to thende that y• king
should not hyndre nor let hys purpose, he offred parte of this his gayn

vnto the kyng. And that the people might the soner mynishe their purses,
and enryche hys chestes, he promysed that he woulde in the begynnyng
of the yere make warre in all the hast agaynst the great Turcke.
By thys meanes and pollecy, thys Alexander gat, accumulated &amp; heaped
vp a great summe of money, and yet no battayle begonne agayne
the Turcke, which in the meane ceason had takē, cōquered &amp; destroyed
many regions, cities and tounes belonging to Christen men, but God
amend all that is amisse.
               Aboute thys tune dyed .iii. Bishops in England, Ihon Morton bisshop
of Caunterbury, Thomas Langtō bishop of Winchester, &amp; Thomas
Rotheram bishop of Yorke. After hym succeded Thomas sauage
bishop of London, in whose place succeded doctor Williā Warham of
whome we made menciō before. And Hēry deane bishop of Salisbury
was made archebishop of Caūterbury. Also Rycharde Foxe bishop of
Durhā, was prefected to the bishoprike of Winchestre. Also this yere
two notable mariages were cōcluded &amp; agreed vpō, but neither solēpnised
now, nor cōsummate as you shal here afterwarde. For king Hēry
graunted his daughter ladye Margaret to Iames the .iiii. kynge of
Scottes. And Ferdinād kyng of Spayne gaue his daughter lady Katheryn
to Arthur prynce of Wales, sonne &amp; heyre apparaunt to y• king
of England. And it is to be considred y• kyng Henry did not ioyne this
affinitie with the kyng of Scottes without cause: For he desiringe nothing
more, then to passe ouer the remanant of his life in peace, rest and
tranquilitee, ymagened in him selfe y• by this coniunccion &amp; couplemēt
of matrimony, no warre or hostilitee hereafter should be attempted either
agaynst hym or hys dominions by the Scottishe kyng or hys nacion,
hauyng sure trust that none other of hys enemyes or of hys rebelles
should hereafter be receaued or maynteyned in the dominions and
territories of hys sonne in lawe. And emongest all other articles thys
was concluded and appoynted, that no Englishmen should entre into
Scotland, without letters cōmendatorie of their awne souereign lord,
or saueconduyte of his wardeyn of the marches, and that prohibicion
was in lyke maner geuen to the Scottes.
            
            
               The .xvii. yere.
               
                  YOu haue heard before, how that the mariage was agreed
betwene prynce Arthur of England, &amp; the lady Katheryne
of Spayne, &amp; how the kyng her father promysed to sende
her with great honoure into England: He nowe this yere
accordyng to hys promes conueyghed her wt a puissaunt
nauye toward England, where she arryued in the porte of Plymmoth
the seconde daye of October, then beyng Saterday. When the kynge
was certefied of her arryual, incōtinēt he sent both for prīce Arthur his
sonne into Wales to repaire to Londō, &amp; sent diuerse great lordes and
knyghtes to cōuey her with triūphe toward her spouse &amp; husband. And

vpon the .xii. daye of Nouembre, she was conueyed frō Lambeth thorough
London with all triūphe and honoure that coulde be deuised or
ymagened, to the Bishops paleys, by the cathedrall churche of s. Paules.
And because I will not be tedious to you, I passe ouer the wyse deuises,
the prudent speches, the costly woorkes, the conninge portratures
practised and set foorth in .vii. goodly beutiful pageauntes erected
&amp; set vp in diuerse places of the citie. I leaue also y• goodly ballades, y•
swete armony, the Musicall instrumentes, which sounded with heauēly
noyes on euery side of the strete. I omit farther, the costly apparel both
of goldsmythes woorke and embraudery, the ryche iewelles, the massy
cheynes, the s
                     ••
                   rynge horsses, the beautifull bardes and the glitteryng
trappers, bothe with belles and spangles of golde. I pretermit also the
ryche apparell of the pryncesse, the straunge fasshion of the Spanyshe
nacion, the beautie of the Englishe ladyes, the goodly demeanure of
of the yoūg damosels, the amorous countenaūce of the lusty bachelers.
I passe ouer also the fyne engrayned clothes, the costly furres of the citezens,
standynge on skaffoldes, rayled from Gracechurche to Paules.
What should I speke of the oderiferous skarlettes, the fyne veluet, y•
pleasaunt, furres, the massye chaynes, which the Mayre of Londō with
the senate sitting on horsebacke at the litle conduyte in Chepe, ware on
their bodyes, &amp; about their neckes. I will not molest you wt rehersyng
the ryche arras, the costly tapestry, the fyne clothes bothe of gold &amp; siluer,
the curious veluettes, the beautiful sattens, nor the pleasaunte sylkes,
which did hange in euery strete where she passed, the wyne yt ranne
continually out of the conduytes, the graueling and rayling of y• stretes
nedeth not to be remembred.
               While this princes soiorned for her recreaciō in the Bishops paleys
of Londō, not without visitaciō of the kynge, the quene and the kinges
mother, there was erected in the body of saynct Paules church, a long
brydge made of tymbre, extendynge from the West doore of the church
to the steppe at the entrynge into the quere, whiche was sixe foote from
the grounde. On thesayde bridge or staige, euen directly before the
consistory of the churche was eleuate a place lyke a mounte, for eyghte
persons to stande vpon, cōpassed rounde about with steppes to assende
and dissende, whiche was couered with fyne redde worsted, and in likewyse
were all the rayles of thesayde staige. On the Northside of this
mount was a place furnished for the kyng &amp; quene, &amp; such other as thei
apoynted. On the Southside of thesame mount stoode the Mayre and
the Magistrates of London. When all preparacion was made, and al
thinges set in an ordre. Upon the daye of saynct Erkenwalde, then beynge
Sundaye, thesayde lady was ledde to thesame mount, and there
prynce Arthur openly espoused her, bothe beynge cladde in whyte, both
lusty and amorous, he of the age of fiftene and more, and she of the age
of .xviii. or there aboutes: The kynge and the Quene, standynge
preuelye on their stayge. After the matrymonye celebrate, the

prince &amp; his wife went vp into the quere, &amp; there herde a solēpne masse
song by the Archebishop of Cauntourbury, associate with .xix. prelates
mytred. And after the masse fynished, the bryde was led homeward to to y•
Bishops palace, by y• duke of Yorke, beyng then a goodly yoūge prince
&amp; the legate of Spayne. Next after folowed the lady Cicile suster to y•
quene, supporting the treyne of the spouse. After whome folowed aboue
an .C. ladyes &amp; gētlewomē gorgeously appareyled &amp; richely adourned.
There was kept that day a sumpteous feast, and yet not so sumpteous
as populous, nor yet so populous as d
                     •
                  licate, nor so delicate as of all
thinges aboūdaūt. For if I should reherse to you the valew of .iiii. cupbordes
that day shewed &amp; set foorth beside the plate that was occupied,
or declare the ryches of the hanginges, canapies or clothe of estate, or
set foorth the numbre of disshes serued at the .iiii. courses &amp; banquettes
the deliuer daunsinge and costly disguisinges, I assure your y• I should
soner fayle then copye of mattre or haboundaunce of honoure. But
euery daye endeth, and nyght ensueth, so when night was come, this lusty
prince and his beautifull bryde were brought and ioyned together
in one bed naked, and there dyd that acte, whiche to the performaunce &amp;
full consummacion of matrimony was most requysite and expedient.
In so muche that his familier seruitours, which had then neither cause
nor rewarde to lye or fayne, declared openly that in the mornynge h
                     •
                  
called for drynke, whiche he before tymes was not accustomed to do.
               At whiche thinge one of hys chambrelaynes meruaylynge, requyred
the cause of hys drouth. To whome he aūswered merely saiyng, I haue
thys nyght bene in the middest of Spayne, whiche is a hote region, &amp;
that iourney maketh me so drye, and if thou haddest bene vnder that
hote clymate, thou wouldest haue bene dryer then I. Then shortely
after the kynge and the quene with the new wedded spouses went from
Baynardes castell by water to Westmynster, on whome the Mayre &amp;
comminaltye of London, in Barges garnished with standardes, stremers
and penons of their deuice, gaue their attendaunce. And there in
the paleys were suche marciall feates, suche valiaunt iustes, suche vygorus
turneys, suche fierce fight at the barreyers, and before that tyme
was of no man had in remembraunce. Of thys royall triumphe lorde
Edwarde duke of Buckyngham was chiefe chalengeour, and lorde
Thomas Grey Marques dorcet was chief defendoure whiche wyth
their aydes and compaygnions, bare theim selfes so valyauntly that
they obteyned great laude and honoure, bothe of the Spanyardes and
of their countrymen.
               Durynge the tyme of these iustes and triumphe, were receaued into
London an Erle, a Byshop, and dyuerse noble personages, sent from
the kynge of Scottes into England, for the conclusion of the mariage
betwene the laqdy Margaret the kynges daughter and hym. Whiche
Erle by porxie in the name of kynge Iames hys master, affied &amp; contracted
the sayd fayre lady. Which assuraūce was published at Paules

Crosse, the daye of the conuersion of saynct Paule, in reioysynge wherof
Te deum was songe, and great fyers made through the citie of London.
Whiche thinges as you haue hearde, beynge 
                     •
                  ully fynished and
accomplished the Ambassadours aswell of Spayne as of Scotlande,
tooke their leaue of the kynge, and not without great rewardes departed
into their countryes and habitacions.
               When the Ambassadours were departed, the kynge entendynge
to auaunce the honour and reputacion of the prynce hys sonne, furnisshed
hym with men and money largely, and sent hym agayne into Wales,
where he was before, to kepe liberall hospitalitee, and to mynystre
to the rude Welshemen indifferent iustice. And least by reason of lacke
of experience he might erre, he appoynted to hym wyse and expert coū
                  saylers,
as syr Rychard Poole hys kynsman, which was hys chief chā
                  berlayne,

               A fewe monethes before the maryage of prynce Arthur, Edmonde
Poole Erle of Southfolfe, sonne to Ihon duke of Southfolke, and
lady Elizabeth suster to kyng Edward the .iiii. beyng stoute and bolde
of courage, and of wyt rashe and hedy, was endited of homicide &amp; murther,
for sleyng of a meane person in his rage and fury. And although
the kynge perdoned him whome he might iustly haue condempned for
that offence, yet because he was brought to the kynges Benche barre
and arrey
                     •
                  ed (which facte he reputed to be a great mayme and blemysh
to hys honoure) tooke it seriously, and shortely after for thys displeasure
sledde to slaunders, without any lycence or saueconduyte geuen
hym of the kynge, to the lady Margaret hys awnt on the mothers side.
Neuerthelesse, whether he was s

                  urred by hys preuy frendes thereunto
moued by the kynge, or whether he trustynge on hys vnuiolated truthe
feared no daungier nor penaltie, he returned agayne, and excused hym
selfe so to the kynge that he was thoughte to be gylteles and inculpable
in any cryme that coulde be obiected to hym, and therefore he was
permytted too go frankely at hys libertie and pleasure.
               But when thys mariage of prince Arthyr was kept at London
with great pompe and solempnitie, and that all the nobilitie were set
on pleasure and solace, and the Kynge hym selfe was pryncipally geuen
too ioye and reioysynge. This Edmond▪ either for that he had ben
at great and excessyue charges at thesame tryumphe and solempnytie,

and by reason therof sore charged with debte. Either sollicited, allured
and prouoked by that olde venemous serpent the duches of Burgoyn,

kyng of England▪ or els stimulate and pricked with enuy, which could

conclusion with hys brother Rycharde fledde agayne into Flaunders.
Thys sad chaunce (I thinke) happened emonge the great ioyes and solaces
of kynge Henry, least that he mighte not by ouermuche gladnes

to haue chaunced, it is manifest and well knowen to you.
               When the kynge vnderstode certaynly that this erle was departed
and returned agayne, he was not a litle vexed and vnquyeted, mistru

that some newe tumulteous busynes shoulde be begonne agayn,
and chiefly therfore blamed hym selfe of folishe folye that he had geuē
hym hys pardon for hys offence, lately committed. Although it was
manifest enough that he dyd it for this purpose, that he might dissemble
and wyncke at the matter so longe vntyll suche tyme, he had some sure
token and perfight knowlege of hys coniuracion, the whiche he perceaued
nowe to be 
                     •
                  urely attempted and begonne, assone as Edmonde de

thys prynciple, that he neyther vexed nor molested wyth any poynte of
displeasure or iniurie by hys prynce or any other fled to the kynges enemyes.
And after all thynges were knowē, opened, pacefied and suppressed,
he willyngely returned and was receaued into hygh fauoure with y•
kynge hys master and souereygne lorde. Howebeit, the kynge lyke a
wylye foxe, knowynge the faythfyll entent of thys syr Robert, and entē
                  dynge
to put hym oute of all gealousy and suspiciō with the lady Margaret,

hys realme. But howsoeuer it chaunced, whether it were for the easing
of hys hart, or for some preuy pollecye, the kynge after the mariage of
hys sonne prynce Arthyr, was so vigilant, so circumspect and so intentyue,

William Courtney, sonne to Edwarde erle of Deuonshyre, a man of
great nobilite, estimacion and vertue, whiche maryed lady Katheryne,
daughter to kyng Edward, lorde William brother to Edmond, erle of
Southfolke, Syr Iames Tyrrell, Syr Ihon Wyndham. Both these
Williams before rehersed were rather taken of suspicion &amp; gelousy, because
they were nere of blood to the coniurators, then for any proued
offence or cryme. Wherfore the lorde William sonne to the erle of
Deuonshire, after the death of kynge Henry the .vii. was deliuered and
set abroade at libertie, by the noble and famous prynce kyng Henry y•
viii. sonne to thesayd kynge, with whome after he was in great fauoure
and estimacion, but shortely after, when he beganne to exercise him selfe
in marciali feates and warlike studye, he syckened of a disease, called
Plur
                        •
                     sis, of whiche malady, because it was straūge and rare to the Phisicians
of England, he at the kynges manoure of Grenewiche desessed,
leuynge one sonne behynde hym, to continue hys stirpe and familie.
               The lorde William, brother to Edmonde the erle of Southfolke had
also greater fauoure shewed in pryson, then he had before. And syr
Iames Tyrrell, and Ihon Wyndham, because they w
                     •
                  re traytours, &amp;
so attaynted the .vi. daye of Maye, they were on the Towre hyll behedded.
But when the erle of Southfolke heard that some of his frendes
were put to execution, and some other committed to perpetuall pryson
and captiuitie, he was in a great agony and feare of hym selfe. And so
beig clerely desperate to haue any fortunate successe in his pretēsed enterprice,
wandred about all Germany and Fraunce for aide &amp; succoure,
prouynge if he coulde fynde any aide or succoure at their handes. But
when he perceaued no stedfast groūd to catche a
                     •
                  chor holde vpon (to
thentent that in conclusion he might vnderstāde that a shameful death
dewe to a man for his offences and crymes cannot by mannes helpe or
mannes reason, be either eschewed or diuerted from hym) he submitted
him selfe vnder the obeysaūce and defence of Philip Archeduke of Austricke
and Burgoyn, and erle of Flaūders. But Rychard hys brother
beyng an experte and polletique man, so craftely cōueyed, and so wisely
ordred hym selfe in thys stormy tempest, that he was not attrapped eyther
with net or snare.
               The kyng, not yet beynge out of doubte of all domestical sedicion &amp;
ciuile discorde, studyed busely howe to restreyne and kepe in a streyte
closure diuerse malefactours, which beyng partakers of this cōspiracy
fled to sondry sanctuaries, tariyng there till a fayre day came to auaūce
foorthward their enterprice. Wherupon he deuised to kepe the gates of
all sanctuaries and places priuileged, shut and wel locked, so that none
should issue out from thence to perturbe and vnquyet hym, hys realme
or people. And for that entent he bothe wrote and sent Ambassadours
to Alexander, then bishop of Rome, desyrynge him by his authoritie to
adiudge and decerne all Englishmen beynge fled to sanctuary or other
places for treason, as enemyes to Christes fayth, and scismatiques too

Christen religion, and as commen perturbers of the quyet people, and
capitaynes and prouokers of trayterous rufflinges, intreditynge and
prohibityng the refuge and priuilege of sanctuary to all suche persons
as once had enioyed the immunitie and liberte of thesame, and after had
fled out, and ef
                     •
                  sones returned agayne. Whiche thinge after that the
Bishop had graunted, it was greatly to the quyetnes and comforte of
kyng Hēry, and many through the feare of that reproche and ignomony,
conuerted them selues to goodnes and dewe subiecciō of their prīce:
Other also that were in securite, and out of all perel and daunger, durst
not hasard them selues for feare of galtroppes or slippynge into y• fyer.
               When the kyng by his high pollecy had compassed and framed his
affaires thus to hys purpose, sodeynly happened a lamentable chaūce
and lachrimable losse to the kynge, quene and all the people. For that
noble prince Arthur, the kynges 
                     •
                  yrst begotten sonne, after that he had
bene maryed to the lady Katheryn hys wyfe .v. monethes, departed out
of this transitory lyfe, in hys castel of Ludlowe, and with a great funerall
obseq
                     •
                  y was buryed in the cathedrall churche of Worcettre. After
whose death the name of prince belonged to his brother duke of Yorke,
hys brother disseasyng without issue, &amp; so without any creacion oughte
to be called, except some cause apparaunt were the let and obstacle of
thesame. Howbeit, the sayde duke vpon suspicion of hys brothers wyfe
to be with chylde, and that doubtfully thoughte by the expert and sage
men of the prynces counsayl, was by a moneth and more delayed from
hys title, name and preheminence, in the which season the truthe might
to womē easely apere. It is reported that this lady Katheryn thought
and feared suche dolorous chaūce to come: For when she had e
                     •
                  braced
her father, and taken her leaue of her noble and prudent mother, &amp; sayled
towardes England, she was continually so tossed and trumbled hyther
and thether with boysterous wyndes, that what for the rage of the
water and contraritie of the wyndes, her ship was prohibited diuerse tymes
to approche the shore and take lande.

deliuer her at the confynes of both the marches. Thus this fayre lady
was conueyghed with a great company of lordes, ladyes, knyghtes, esquyers

in the whiche diuerse actes were concluded, whyche
were thought necessary and expedient for the preseruaciō
of the publique weale. And emonge other thinges, it was
determined that theues and murderers duely cōuicted by
the lawe to dye, should be burned in the hand, and cōmitted to the Bisshops
custody as I haue before declared. After this, certayne money
was graunted to the kynge, by the whole Parliament, and the goodes
of men outlawed were forfeyted and confisqued. There was also called
(as the maner is) a congregacion of the clergie, to thentent, that they wt
their treasure and money might auaūce and preferre the cōmon wealth
of the realme.

               Kyng Henry, now drawynge to age, and before this tyme, euer punched,
stimulated and pricked with the scrupulous stynges of domesticall
sedicion and ciuile commocion, in so muche that he more detested &amp;
abhorred intestine and priuate warre, then death or any thynge more
terrible. Wherfore he determyned so pollitiquely to prouyde that all y•
causes of suche vnquyetnes and mischief to come, shoulde be eradicate

                  rped: which ymaginacion and purpose he doubted not to compasse
and brynge to effect. If he made lowe and abated the courage of
hys subiectes and vassalles, and especially of the rychest sorte, remembrynge
the olde prouerbe, that men throughe aboundaunce of ryches
waxe more insolent, hedstronge and robustius, and that nothynge is
more to men acceptable or desyrous, then aboūdaunce of treasure and
plentye of money, whiche people either for feare of lo

                  ynge, or hope
of gaynynge of worldly ryches▪ desyre euer either peace or warre. But
to thentent that men might not thinke nor reporte that he whiche is
their kynge constituted of God to reuenge all iniuries to theym done
and committed, should oppresse and wrongfully polle and exact money
of hys subiectes, he deuysed wyth hym selfe by what honest meane he
myght performe it. And thus deuisyng with hym selfe, it came into hys
hed that the Englishmen dyd litle passe vpon the obseruacion and kepynge
of penall lawes or pecuniall statutes, made and enacted for the
preseruacion of the commen vtilitee and wealthe. And therefore, if inquisicion
were had of suche penall statutes, there should be fewe noble
men, merchauntes, fermers, husbandemen, grasyers nor occupyers, but
they shoulde be founde transgressours and violators of thesame statutes.
After that he had taken thys counsayll, he soughte oute the penall
lawes, and put them in execucion, and thei that were founde offenders,
were easely at the beginnynge fyned and scourged. After that he apointed
.ii. masters and surueyers of his forfaytes, y• one syr Richard Empson,
and the other Edmond Dudley, bothe learned in the lawes of the
realme. And these twoo persons contended, whiche of theim by mooste
bryngyng in might most please and satisfye his mastres desyre and appetide.
Wherefore in the beginnynge, they armed with a companye
of accusers (commonly called promoters) whyche brought to theim the
names of the offendours, estemed and regarded so muche the gayne of
money, that they clerely forgate and banyshed oute of their remembraunce
their duetye present, the peril that might ensue, and the thanke
and good will that they might haue obteyned, and yet they had warnynge
of greate and sage persons to close their handes from suche vncharitable
doynges and cruell extremitie, accordyng to the Adage, the
extremitie of iustice, is extreme iniurie.

he had spoken with kyng Henry hys louinge and faythfull frende and

of grauytie and dubious, ought to be excluded: wherefore he alledged
that protractynge of tyme myght turne hym to great preiudice,

and acquayntaunce, whiche they vsed at their last metynge,
and partely for that he trusted that hys landynge in England should
turne to hys proffite and commoditie. Therefore first he wrote many
and diuers letters to syr Ihon Carew, and syr Thomas Trenchard,
wyllinge and warnynge them withall kyndenes of humanitie to enterteyne

He was a man of stature conuenient, of countenaunce amiable

wonderfull straunge to many men, because the violencie of the wynde
had blowen doune an Egle of brasse, beynge set to shewe and manifest
on which parte y• wynd blew, frō a pynnacle or spire of Paules church.
And in the fallyng, thesame Egle brake, &amp; batered another Egle that

Thomas Grene fell sycke before, and contynued in the Towre in hope
to be restored aswell to his health as he was to hys libertie, and there

                  NOwe approched the ende &amp; terme of the .iii. yeres of peace
that I spake of before, at whiche tyme kyng Henry thought
his fatal daye to be at hand: For his sickenes encreased
daily more and more, so that he might easely perceaue
that death was not farre of tariyng hys praye: Therfore
lyke a good prynce, desiring to exhibite some gratuitie to hys people y•
he might be had in memory after his disease, graūted of his great liberalite
a general pardon to all men, for all offences done, &amp; perpetrate agaynst
hys lawes and statutes. But because murtherers &amp; theues were
not onely offenders to him, but also to other, he excepted them &amp; some other
out of his pardō. He paide also the fees of all prisoners in ye gayles
in and aboute Londō, abyding their only for that duety. He payde also
the debtes of al such persons as laye in the counters of Londō, or Ludgate
for .xl.s &amp; vnder, &amp; some he releued that were condempned in .x.l.
               For thys his goodnes &amp; pitie shewed to hys people, beynge sore vexed
with inquysitors, pollers &amp; promoters, general processiō was had daily

would crye out, &amp; say y• it was done more for the loue &amp; desire of gayne

&amp; ryches of hys realme, for he by his highe pollecy, meruelously

               ber,
wher he rested thre daies, and euery daie had there Dirige &amp; Masse
song by a Prelate mitered: and from thence he was conueighed into the
halle, where he was also three daies, and had like seruice there, and so
thre daies in the Chapell, and in euery of these thre places, was a hearce
of waxe, garnished with banners, and .ix. mourners geuyng there attendance,
all the seruice tyme: and euery daie thei offered, and euery place
chaunged with blacke clothe. Upon Wedinsdaie, the .ix. daie of Maie,
the corps was putte into a Chariot, couered with blacke clothe of golde
drawen with .v. greate Corsers, couered with blacke Ueluet, garnished
with cusshions of fine gold: and ouer the corps, was an Image or a representacion
of the late kyng, laied on Cusshions of golde, and thesaied
image was appareled, in the kynges riche robes of estate, with a croune
on the hed, and ball and scepter in the handes: and the chariot was garnished
with banners, and Pēcelles of tharmes of his dominions, titles
and geanealogies. When the chariot was thusordered, the kinges chapell,
and a great nombre of Prelates, set forward praiyng: then folowed
all the kynges seruauntes, in blacke, then folowed the Chariot: and after
the Chariot .ix. mourners, and on euery side wer caried long torches
and shorte, to the nombre of .vi.C. and in this ordre thei came to saincte
Georges felde, from Richemond. There met with theim, all the Priestes
and Clearkes, and religious men, within the citee, and without (whiche
went formoste, before the kynges Chapell) the Maior and his brethren,
with many commoners, all clothed in blacke, met with the corps at Lō
               don
Bridge, and so gaue their attendaūce on thesame, through the citee:
and in good ordre, the compaignie passed through the citie, whereof the
stretes on euery side, wer set with long Torches, and on the stalles stode
young children, holdyng tapers, and so with greate reuerence, the Chariot
was brought to the Cathedrall Churche of sainct Paule, where the
body was taken out, and caried into the Quire, and set vnder a goodly
Herce of waxe, garnished with Banners, Pencelles, &amp; Cusshions, where
was soung a solempne Dirige, and a Masse, with a Sermon, made by
the Busshoppe of Rochester: duryng whiche tyme, the kynges houshold
and the mourners, reposed theim in the Busshoppes Paleis. The nexte
daie, the corps in like ordre was remoued, toward Westminster, sir Edward
Haward, bearyng the kynges banner, on a courser trapped, in the
armes of the defunct. In Westminster was a curious herse, made of .ix.
principalles, full of lightes, whiche, were lighted at the commyng of the
corps, whiche, was taken out of the Chariot, by sixe Lordes, and set vnder
the Herse, the Image or the representacion, liyng vpon the Cusshyn
on a large palle of golde. The herse was double railed: within the firste
railes, satte the mourners, and within the seconde raile, stoode knightes

                  〈◊〉
                banners of sainctes, and without thesame, stoode officers of armes.

When the mourners were set, Gartier kyng at Armes, cried, for the
soule of the noble prince kyng Henry the .VII. late kyng of this realme:
then the quire beganne Placebo, and so song Dirige, whiche, beyng finished,
the mourners departed into the Palaice, where thei had a voyde,
and so reposed for that night.
            The next daie, wer three Masses solemply song, by Busshoppes, and
at the last Masse was offered, the kynges banner and courser, his coate
of armes, his sworde, his target, and his helme, and at thende of Masse
the mourners offered vp, riche Paulles of cloth of gold and Baudekin,
and when the quire sang, Libera me, the body was put into the yearthe,
and then the lorde Treasorer, lorde Stewarde, lorde Chamberlein, the
Treasorer, and Comptroler of the kynges houshold, brake their staues
and caste theim into the graue. Then Gartier cried with a loude voyce,
Viue le Roy Henry le hu
                     •
                  esme, Roy Dangliter, &amp; de Fraunce, sire Dirland.
Then all the mourners, and all other that had geuen their attendance,
on this funerall Obsequie, departed to the Palaice, where thei had a
greate and a sumptuous feast.
            Wonder it were to write, of the lamentacion that was made, for this
Prince emongest his seruauntes, and other of the wisest sort, and the ioy
that was made for his death, by suche as were troubled, by 
                  •
               igor of his
lawe: yet the towarde hope, whiche, in all poyntes appered, in the young
kyng did bothe repaire and comforte, the heuie hartes of them, whiche,
had lost so wise and sage a prince: and also did put out of the myndes of
suche, as were releued by thesaied kynges deathe, all their olde grudge
and rancor, and confirmed their newe ioye, by the newe graunte of his
pardon.
            When the funeralles of this late kyng, wer thus honorably finished,
greate preparacion was made, for the coronaciō of this new kyng whiche
was appoynted on Midsomer daie nexte ensuyng: duryng whiche
preparacion, the kyng was moued, by some of his coūsail, that it should
be honorable▪ and profitable to his realme,The Kynges mariage doubtefull at the beginnyng. to take to wife the lady Katherin,
late wife to Prince Arthur his brother disseased, least she hauyng
so greate a dowrie, might mary out of the realme, whiche, should be vnprofitable
to hym: by reason of whiche mocion, the kyng beyng young,
and not vnderstandyng the lawe of God, espous
                  •
               d thesaied lady Katherine,
the third daie of Iune, the whiche mariage, was dispensed with by
Pope Iuly, at the request of her father, kyng Farnando, contrary to the
opinion of all the Cardinals of Rome, beyng diuines. This mariage
of the brothers wife, was muche murmured against, in the beginnyng,
and euer more and more, searched out by learnyng and scripture, so that
at the laste, by the determinacion, of the best vniuersities of Christendō,
it was adiudged detestable, and plain contrary to Goddes lawe, as you
shall here, after .xx. yeres.
            If I should declare, what pain, labour, and diligence, the Taylers,
Embrouderers, and Golde Smithes tooke, bothe to make and deuise

garmentes, for Lordes, Ladies, Knightes, and Esquires, and also for
deckyng, trappyng, and adornyng of Coursers, Ienetes, and Palffreis,
it wer to long to rehersse, but for a suretie, more riche, nor more straunge
nor more curious workes, hath not been seen, then wer prepared against
this coronacion.
            On the .xxj. daie of this moneth of Iune, the kyng came from Grenewiche
to the Tower, ouer London Bridge, and so by Grace Churche,
with whom, came many a well appareled gentleman, but in especiall the
Duke of Buckyngham, whiche, had a goune all of goldsmithes worke,
very costly, and there the kyng rested, till Saterdaie next ensuyng.
            Fridaie the twentie and twoo daie of Iune, euery thyng beeyng in a

                  •
               eadines, for his Coronacion: his grace with the Quene, beeyng in the
Tower of London, made there Knightes of the Bathe, to the nombre
of twentie and foure, with all the obseruaunces and Ceremonies, to thesame
belongyng.
            And the morowe folowyng, beyng Saterdaie, the .xxiii. day of thesaid
monethe, his grace, with the Quene, departed from the Tower, through
the citie of London, against whose cōmyng, the streates where his grace
should passe, were hanged with Tapistrie, and clothe of Arras. And the
greate parte, of the Southe side of Chepe, with clothe of gold, and some
parte of Cornehill also. And the streates railed and barred, on the one
side, from ouer against Grace Churche, vnto Bredstreate, in Chepeside,
where euery occupacion stode, in their liueries in ordre, beginnyng with
base and meane occupacions, and so assendyng to the worshipfull craftes:
highest and lastly stode the Maior, with the Aldermen. The Goldsmithes
stalles, vnto the ende of the Olde Chaunge, beeyng replenished
with Uirgins in white, with braunches of white Waxe: the priestes and
clerkes, in riche Copes▪ with Crosses and censers of siluer, with censyng
his grace, and the Quene also, as thei passed. The features of his body,
his goodly personage, his amiable visage, princely countenaunce, with
the noble qualities of his royall estate, to euery man knowen, nedeth no
rehersall, consideryng, that for lacke of cunnyng, I cannot expresse the
giftes of grace and of nature, that God hath endowed hym with all: yet
partly, to discriue his apparell, it is to bee noted, his grace ware in his
vpperst apparell, a robe of Crimosyn Ueluet, furred with Armyns, his
iacket or cote of raised gold, the placard embrowdered with Diamōdes
Rubies, Emeraudes, greate Pearles, and other riche Stones, a greate
Bauderike aboute his necke, of greate Balasses. The Trapper of his
Horse▪ Damaske gold, with a depe purfell of Armyns, his knightes and
Esquires for his body, in Crimosyn Ueluet, and all the gentlemen, with
other of his chappell, and all his officers, and houshold seruauntes, wer
appareled in Skarlet. The Barons of the fiue Portes, bare the Canaby,
or clothe of estate: For to resite vnto you, the greate estates by name,
the ordre of their goyng, the nombre of the lordes Spirituall and temporall▪
Knightes, Esquires, and Gentlemen, and of their costly and rich

apparell, of seuerall deuises and fashions, who tooke vp his horse best,
or who was richest besene, it would aske long tyme, and yet I should omitte
many thynges, and faile of the nombre, for thei were verie many:
wherefore I passe ouer, but this I dare well saie, there was no lacke or
scarsitie of clothe of Tissue, clothe of Golde, clothe of Siluer, Broderie,
or of Golde smithes workes: but in more plentie and abundaunce, then
hath been seen, or redde of at any tyme before, and thereto many and a
greate nombre of chaines of Golde, and Bauderikes, bothe massy and

appareled, and aboute their bodies trauers, thei did beare twoo Robes,
the one of the Duchie of Guyon, and the other for the Duchie of Normandie,
with Hattes on their heddes, poudered with Armyns, for the

bearyng his cloke, the other his hatte, appareled bothe in Golde Smithes
woorke, and Broudery, their horses Trapped, in burned Siluer,

came six Thomas Brandon, Master of the kynges Horse, clothed in tissue,
Broudered with Roses of fine Gold, and trauerse his body, a greate
Bauderike of Gold, greate and massy, his Horse trapped in Golde, leadyng

            Then next folowyng in ordre, came the Quenes retinew, as Lordes,
Knightes, Esquires, and gentle menne in their degrees, well mounted,
and richely appareled in Tissues, clothe of Golde, of Siluer, Tynsels,

Trapped in White clothe of gold, her persone appareled in white Satyn
Embrodered, her heire hangyng doune to her backe, of a very great

with many riche orient stones. Next after, sixe honorable personages on
White Palfreis, all appareled in Clothe of Golde, and then a Chariot
couered, and the Ladies therein, all appareled in Clothe of Golde. And
another sort of Ladies, and then another Chariot, then the Ladies next

to be had and doen.
            The morowe folowyng beyng sondaie, and also Midsomer daie, this
noble prince with his Quene, at time conuenient, vnder their Canabies
borne by the Barons of the fiue Portes, went from thesaied Palaice, to
Westminster Abbey vpon clothe, called vulgarly cloth of Ray, the whiche
clothe was cut and spoyled, by the rude and common people, immediatly
after their repaire into the Abbey, where, accordyng to the sacred
obseruaunce, and auncient custome, his grace with the Quene, were annoynted

prelates of the realme there present, and the nobilitie, with a greate

thei would receiue, obey, and take thesame moste noble Prince, for
their kyng, who with greate reuerence, loue, and desire, saied and cried,

the left hand, the cobard of .ix. stages, their noble personages beyng set:
first, at the bryngyng of the first course, the trump
                  •
               ttes blew vp. And in

sumpteous, with many subtleties, straunge deuises, with seuerall poses,
and many deintie dishes. At the kynges fete, vnder the table, wer certain
gentlemen. And in likewise with the quene, who there continued, during
that long &amp; royall feast. What should I speake or write, of the sūpteous
fine, and delicate meates, prepared for this high and honorable coronaciō,
prouided for aswel in the parties beyond the sea, as in many and 
                  •

               ted

hymself with humble reuerence, before the kynges maiestie, to whō,
Garter kyng of herauldes, cried and said with a loude voyce, sir knight

               trey,
but onely this. And there with all, commaunded his Heraulde to

doen, and offers made, thesaid knight or champion, eftsones repaired to
the kynges presence, demaundyng drinke, to whō the kynges grace sent
a cup of gold, with wine, wherof after this knight had drōke▪ he demaū
               ded
the couer of thesaied cuppe, whiche, to hym was also deliuered: that
doen, he departed out of the halle, with thelaid cup &amp; couer, as his awne
            The maner of his tenure is this, that at the Coronacion of the kyng,
he shall go to the armarie, and there take the kynges best harneis, saue

and charge is to edifie the people, with the word of God, takyng cure of

that thei take as greate cure, for the profite of their pursses, with pleasure
of huntyng and haukyng, besides other their pastymes, after thei
come to the best of their promocion, with small kepyng of hospitalitie:
as other whiche were their predecessors, and muche worse, so that parte
of their pastymes spent in writyng, and settyng furthe the iestes, actes
and deedes, of the nobilitie of Englande, with the manyfold commodities
of thesame▪ should muche ennoble the princes thereof, seyng by daily
experience, Busshoppes, Archebusshoppes, Abbottes, and other clarkes,

and better linage, and as verteous as thei, daily enforce theimselfes, to
auaunce their Princes, their Realmes, and natiue Countreis, aswell in
Latin, as in their vulgare toungue. But to returne to thende of this honorable
feast, the tables auoyded, the wafers were brought. Then Sir
Stephen Ieny

               s, that tyme Maior of London, whom, the kyng before
he satte doune to dynner, had dubbed knight, whiche, beganne the Erles

            For the more honor▪ and ennoblyng of this triumphaunt Coronaciō,

Gold with certain Arches or Turrettes gilded, to support thesame Castle.
And the targettes of the armes, of the defendauntes, appoynted for

And further, thesaied Ladie desired the kyng, that it might please

            Then came in an other bende of horse men, freshly and well appareled

                  •
               thers therevpon, some of one coloure,
and some of an other, enteryng before into the felde, with Drōmes
and Fifes a greate nombre, euery man takyng vp his horse, in his best
maner, aswell for their Ladies, as also for laude or praise to bee geuen
them. After whom, folowed a good nombre of foote men, in Ueluettes, &amp;
other silkes, cutte and embroudered, with hose to thesame accordyngly, &amp;
bonettes and other furniture, after a freshe and lustie fashion. Nexte to
theim came on horse backe, eight persones, whose names were, sir Ihon
Pechy, Sir Edwarde Neuell, Sir Edwarde Guildeforde, Sir Ihon
Carre, Sir Wyllyam Parre, Sir Gyles Capell, Sir Griffith Dun,
and Sir Roulande, Armed also at all poyntes, with shyldes of their
awne armes, with riche Plumes, and other deuises on their hedde peces
their Bases and Trappers of Tissew, clothe of Golde, Siluer and veluet,
and nexte before theim, a gentle manne on horsebacke, in a coate of
Blewe Ueluet, embroudered with golde, and his horse Trapped in the
same suite, with a spere of Golde on his thigh, and thesame presented to
the Quene: saiyng, that it was enformed those knightes of his compaignie,
how that Dame Pallas, had presented sixe of her scholers to the

Kyng, but whether thei came to learne, or to teache feactes of Armes,
thei knewe not. And further declared, that his knightes were come, to
doo feactes of armes, for the loue of Ladies, wherefore, he besought her
grace, to license those Knightes to proue theim selfes, against Dame
Pallas Schollers: and that in case, her Schollers brake more speres,
on thesaied knightes, by the viewe of the Iudges, and the report of the
Herauldes, then thesame knightes should dooe on theim, then thesaied
Scholers of Pallas knightes, to haue the spere of Gold for their prise.
And if the knightes brake more speres, then Dame Pallas Schollers,
thesaied knightes to haue the Christall Shilde. The whiche request to
theim graunted, the Iustes beganne, where euery manne did acquite
hymself, well and valiauntly, but who had the price of other, I knowe
not, the night commyng on, the Iustes ended.
            The next daie approched, the foresaied defenders, Schollers to Pallas
on Horsebacke, armed Cape a pie, the one side of their Bases, and
Bardes of their Horses white Ueluet, embroudered with Roses of gold
and other embrouderies, the other side Grene Ueluet, embroudered
with Pomegranetes of Golde, euery one of theim on his hedde pece,
had an heare of flatte Golde of Damaske, presented theimselfes, before
the kyng ready to Tourney.
            Then immediatly on the other parte came in,Dianas knightes. the fore named eighte
knightes ready armed, their Basses and Bardes of their Horse, Grene
Sattyn, embroudered with freshe deuises, of Bramble branches, of fine
Golde curiously wroughte, poudered ouer all. And after theim a greate
nombre of hornes blowen, by menne apparelled in Grene Clothe, with
Cappes and Hosen of like suite, as Forsters or kepers, and a Pagente
made like a Parke, paled with pales of White and Grene, wherein wer
certain Fallowe Dere, and in thesame Parke curious Trees made by
crafte, with Busshes, Fernes, and other thynges in likewise wroughte,
goodly to beholde. The whiche Parke or deuise, beeyng brought before
the Quene, had certain gates thereof opened, the Dere ranne out thereof
into the Palaice, the greye houndes were lette slippe and killed the
Dere: the whiche Dere so killed, were presented to the Quene and the
Ladies, by the foresaied knightes. Crocheman, whiche the daie before
broughte in the spere of golde, there declared, that thesame knightes
were seruauntes to Diana, and beeyng in their pastyme of huntyng, newes
were brought vnto theim, that Dame Pallas knightes, were come
into those parties, to doo deedes of armes: wherefore, thei had lefte their
huntyng and chase, and repaired also thether, to encounter with the knightes
of Pallas, and so to fight with thē, for the loue of ladies to thutterance:
saiyng, that if Pallas knightes vanquished the other, or made
them to leue the feld, then thei to haue the dere killed, and the greye hoū
               des
that slewe them. And in case Dianas knightes, ouer came the other,
thei to haue their swordes, and none other thyng more. Whereupon the
Quene and Ladies, sent to the kyng to haue his aduise and pleasure in

this behalfe, his grace conceiuyng, that there was some grudge, and displeasure
betwene theim, thynkyng if suche request wer to theim graunted,
some inconuenience might ensue, would not there vnto agre, so that
for the appeasyng thereof, it was awarded that bothe parties, should
tourney togethers, geuyng but a certain strokes, whiche dooen thei departed:
And so these Iustes brake vp, and the prices geuen to euery mā
after his desertes.
            This yere the kyng pardoned the lorde Henry, brother to the Duke
of Buckyngham, beeyng committed to the Tower▪ vpon suspicion of
treason laied vnto hym, but not proued, and sone after at the Parliament,
created hym Erle of Wylshire.
            Also this yere, the kyng ordeined fiftie Gentle menne to bee speres,
euery of theim to haue an Archer, a Dimilaunce, and a Custrell, and euery
Spere to haue three greate Horses, to bee attendaunt on his persone,
of the whiche bende, the Erle of Essex was Lieuetenaunt, and sir
Ihon Pechie Capitain, who endured but a while, the apparell and
charges were so greate, for there were none of theim, but thei and their
Horses, were appareled and trapped in Clothe of Golde, Siluer, and
Golde Smithes woorke, and their seruauntes richely appareled also.
            This yere also, was a greate Pestilence in the toune of Caleis, and
muche people died, in so muche that the kyng, at the request of his counsaill
of Caleis, consideryng the weakenes of the toune, sent thether Sir
Ihon Pechie, with three hundred menne to tary there, who continued
there vnto suche time, that the plague was ceassed, and newe souldiours
admitted, to suche roumes as then were vacant, and then returned into
Englande. Furthermore, this yere the kyng somoned his Parliament,
in the monethe of Nouembre, whiche, began in the moneth of Ianuari
                  •

aucthoritie of Parliament, that sir Thomas Empson knighte, and Edmund
Dudeley Esquire, late Counsailers to Kyng Henry the seuenth,

            Thesame yere the plague was greate, and reigned in diuerse partes
of the realme, the kyng kept his Christemas at Richemond. And the .xii
daie of Ianuarie, diuerse gentlemen freshely appareled, prepared them
self to Iuste, vnknowen to the kynges grace, whereof, he beyng secretly
informed, caused hymself, and one of his priuie chambre, called Willyā
Compton to bee secretly armed, in the litle Parke of Richemond: and so
came into the Iustes, vnknowen to all persones, and vnloked for: The
kyng ranne neuer openly before, and there wer broken many staues, and
greate praise geuen to the twoo straungers, but specially to one, whiche
was the kyng: howebeit, at a course by misfortune, sir Edward Neuell
Esquire, brother to the Lorde of Burgainie, did runne against Master
Cumpton, and hurte hym sore, and was likely to dye. One persone there
was, that knew the kyng, and cried, God saue the king, with that, al the

people wer astonied, and then the kyng discouered hymself, to the greate
comforte of all the people.
            The kyng sone after, came to Westminster with the Quene, and all

The banket beyng ready, the Kyng leadyng the Quene, entered into the
Chambre▪ then the Ladies, Ambassadours, and other noble menne, folowed

satte the Ambassadours and Ladies, as thei were Marshalled by the
kyng, who would not sit, but walked from place to place, makyng chere

sone after entred into the Chamber, in their vsuel apparell. And so the
kyng made great chere to the Quene, Ladyes and Ambassadours: The
Supper or Banket ended▪ and the tables auoyded the kyng beeyng in

their places in their degrees. Then began the daūsyng, and euery man
toke muche hede to them that daūsed. The kyng perceyuing that, withdrew

hym selfe sodenly out of the place, with certayn other persons appoynted

            Thys yere also came Ambassadours from the kyng of Arragō and
Castell into this Realme, who were hyghly entertayned and royally receyued,
and repayred muche to the Courte. It happened on a daye, that
there were certayn noble men made a wager to runne at the rynge, and
parties were taken, and whych partye atteyned or toke awaye the ringe

oftenest with a certayne courses, should wynne the wager. Wherof, the
kynges grace hearing offered to be on the one partye with .vi. companions:
The Ambassadours hearynge therof, were muche desirous to se
fhys wager tryed, and specially the Ambassadours of Spaigne, who
had neuer seen the kyng in harneys. At the daye apointed, the king was
mounted on a godly Courser▪ trapped in purpull veluet cutte, the inner
syde wherof was wrought with flatte golde of Damaske in the stoole,
and the veluet on the other syde cut in letters: So that y• gold appered

            And on the Ueluet betwene the letters were fastyned, castels and shefes

            On the other syde came in an other bende of gentelmen, freshely appareyled,
and pleasaunt to beholde, all appareyled in clothe of golde,
chekered with flatte golde of Damaske, and poudered with Roses: and
so euery man ranne, but to conclude, the pryce was geuē vnto the king.
euery man dyd runne .xii. courses, the kyng dyd beare awaye the rynge

Ambassadours desyred to haue some of the badges or deuises, whiche
were on the kynges trapper: hys grace therof knowynge commaunded
Euery of them to take therof what it pleased them, who in effect toke
all or the more parte: for in the beginnyng they thought they had bene
counterfait, and not of golde.
            In this yere from diuers Realmes and Countreys came many Ambassadours,

whych were hyghly enterteyned.

where the kyng behaued hym selfe so wel, and deliuered him selfe so valiauntly
by hys hardy prowes and greate strength that the prayse and
laude was geuen to hys grace, and hys aydes: notwithstādyng that diuers

one Gyot a gentelman of Almayne, a talle man, and a good man of armes.
And than after they had done, they marched alwayes two and two
togethers, and so dyd their feates and enterprises euery man very wel:
Albeit, it happened the sayde Gyot to fight with syr Edward Haward,
which Gyot was by hym stryken to the grounde.
               The morow after this enterprise done, the kyng with the Quene came

               From thence, the .viii. daye of Nouember, his grace remoued to Rychemond,

euery man after his deuise. At these Iustes the king brake more staues
then any other, and therfore had the pryce: At the Turney in likewyse,
the honor was his. The second night were diuers straūgers of Maximilian
the Emperours court, and Ambassadours of Spaygne with y•

the Quenes chamber, who so did. And in the meane season, the kynge
with .xv. other, appareled in Almayne Iackettes of Crymosyne, &amp; purple

                  mery, and after a certayne

                     •
                  yme that they had played with the Quene and the straungers, they departed.
Then sodenly entred .vi. mynstrels, rychely appareled, plaiyng
on their instrumentes, and then folowed .xiiii. persones Gentelmen, all
appareyled in yealow Satyne, cut like Almaynes, bearyng torches.
               After thē came .vi. disguised in whyte Satyne and grene, enbroudered
and set with letters and castels of fyne golde in bullion, the garmentes
were of straunge facion, with also straunge cuttes, euery cutte knytte

Fyrst of these .vi. was the kyng, the erle of Essex, Charles Brandon, syr

after whome came in .vi. ladyes, appareled in garmentes of Crymosyn
Satyn enbroudered and trauessed with cloth of gold, cut in Pomegranettes
and yokes, strynged after the facion of Spaygne. Then the

ended the pas

                  ime.
               It is to be noted that at this tyme the Quene was great with childe,
and shortly after this pastyme, she toke her chamber at Richemond, for
the whiche cause the kynge kept hys Christmas there. And on Newyeres
daye, the first day of Ianuary, the Quene was deliuered of a Prince
to the great gladnes of the Realme, for the honor of whome, fyers were
made, and diuers vessels with wyne, set for suche as woulde take therof
in certayne streates in London, and generall processions thereupon to
laude God. As touchynge the preparacion of the Princes Christening,
I ouerpasse, which was honorablie done, whose godfathers at the fout
were the Archebishop of Caunterbury, and the erle of Surrey. Godmother
the lady Katheryne Countesse of Deuonshire, daughter to kynge
Edward the fourth.
               Agaynste the .xii. daye or the daye of the Epiphanie at nighte, before
the banket in the Hal at Richemond, was a pageaūt deuised like a moū

glisteringe by night, as thoughe it had been all of golde and set
with stones, on the top of the which mountayne was a tree of golde, the
braunches and bowes frysed with golde, spredynge on euery side ouer
the mountayne, with Roses and Pomegarnettes, the which mountayne
was with vices brought vp towardes the kyng, &amp; out of thesame came

                  led in cloth of golde, and the chyldren of honor called
the Henchemen, whiche were freshely disguised, and daunced a Morice
before the kyng. And that done, reentred the moūtaine and then it was
drawen backe, and then was the wassaill or banket brought in, and so
brake vp Christmas.
               Shortly after▪ and before the Quenes churchinge, the kynge rode to
Walsingham. The Quene beyng Churched or purified, the kyng and
she remoued from Rychemonde to Westmynster, where was preparacion
for a solempne Iustes in the honor of the Quene, the kyng beyng

               A place in the Pallayce was prepared for the kynge, and also the
Quene, rychely hanged, the inner parte with cloth of golde, and the vtter
with ryche clothe of Arras. These Iustes beganne the .xiii. daye of
February. After that, that the Quene with her trayne of ladyes had taken
their places, into the Pallays was conueyed a pag
                     •
                  aūt of a great
quantite, made like a forest with rockes, hilles and dales, with diuers

within thesame forrest, garnyshed in cotes and hodes of grene
Ueluet, by whome lay a great number of speres, all the trees, herbes, &amp;
floures, of thesame forrest were made of grene Ueluet, grene Damaske,
and silke of diuers colours, Satyn and Sercenet. In the middes of
this forrest was a cas

                  led, makynge a garlande of Roses
for the pryce. This forrest was drawen, as it were by strength of twoo
great beastes, a Lyon and an Ant
                     •
                  lop, the Lyon floryshed all ouer with
Damaske golde, The Antelop was wrought all ouer with siluer of Damaske,
hys beames or hornes &amp; tuskes of golde: these beastes were led
with certayne men appareiled like wilde men, or woodhouses, their bodies,
heddes, faces, handes, and legges, couered with grene Sylke flosshed:
On either of the sayde Antelop and Lyon, sate a ladye richely appareiled,
the beastes were tyed to the pageant with greate chaynes of
golde, as horses be in the carte. When the pageant rested before the
Quene, the forenamed forsters blew their hornes, then the deuise or pageant
opened on all sides, and out issued the foresayde foure knyghtes,
armed at all peces, euery of them a spere in his hande on horsebacke
with great plumes on their heddes, their basses and trappers of clothe
of gold, euery of them his name enbroudered on hys basse and trapper:
on the other parte with great noyse, aswell of Trompettes as of Drō
                  mes
entred into the felde, the erle of Essex, the lord Thomas Hawarde
with many other cleane armed, their trappers and basses all of Crymosyn
Satyn enbroudered with braunches of Pomegarnettes of golde,
and posies wyth many a freshe Gentelman, rydynge before them, theyr
fotemen also well appareiled: And so the Iustes beganne, and endured
all that daye.
               The morow beyng the .xiii. daye of February after dynner, at tyme
conuenient, the Quene with the ladyes repaired to see the Iustes, the
trompettes blew vp, and in came many a noble man and Gentelmā, rychely
appareiled, takynge vp their horses, after whome folowed certayne
lordes appareiled, they and their horses in cloth of golde and 
                     •

                  usset Ueluet. And a greate
number of Gentelmen on fote, in russet satyn and yealow, and yomen in
russet damaske and yealow, all the nether parte of euery mans hosen
Skarlet, and yealow cappes. Then came the kynge vnder a Pauilion
of clothe of golde, and purpul Ueluet enbroudered, and poudered with
H. and K. of fyne golde, the compas of the Pauilion aboue, enbroudered
rychely, and valenced with flat golde, beten in wyre, with an Imperiall
croune in the top of fyne golde, hys bases and trapper of clothe of
gold, fretted with damaske gold, the trapper pēdant to the tail. A crane
and chafron of stele, in the frount of the chafrō was a goodly plume set

aydes, euery of them vnder a Pauilion of Crymosyn damaske &amp; purple

poudred with H. and K. of fyne golde valenced and frynged with golde
of damaske: on the top of euery Pauilion a greate K. of golde smythes
worke, the number of the Gentelmen and yomen attendant a fote, appareiled
in russet and yealow was .C.lxviii. Then next these Pauilions
came .xii. chyldren of honor, sitting euery of them on a great courser, rychely
trapped and enbroudered in seuerall deuises and facions, where
lacked neither brouderie nor goldsmythes worke, so that euery chyld &amp;
horse in deuice and facion was contrary to other, whiche was goodly to
beholde.
               Then on the counter part, entred syr Charles Brādon, fyrst on horsbacke
in a long robe of Russet satyn, like a recluse or a religious person
and hys horse trapped in thesame sewte, without dromme or noyse of
mynstrelsye, puttinge a byll of peticion to the Quene, the effect wherof
was, that if it would please her to licence hym to runne in her presence,
he woulde do it gladly, and if not, then he woulde departe as he came.
After that hys request was graunted, then he put of hys sayde habyte,
and was armed at all peces, with ryche bases &amp; horse, also rychely trapped,
and so did runne hys horse to the tylte ende, where diuers men on
fote appareiled in Russet satyn awaited on him: next after came in alone
young Henry Guylford Esquier, hym selfe and hys horse in russet cloth
of golde▪ and clothe of siluer, closed in a deuice, or a pageant made lyke
a Castel or a Turret, wrought of Russet sercenet florence, wrought, and
set out in golde with hys worde or posye, and al his men in Russet satyn
and white, with hosen to thesame, and their bonettes of like colors, demaunding
also licence of the Quene to runne, whiche to him graunted
toke place at thende of the tylte. Then came next the Marques Dorset
and syr Thomas Bulleyn, like two pilgrems from sainct Iames, in 
                     •
                  aberdes
of blacke Ueluet, with palmers hattes on their helmettes, wyth
long Iacobs staues in their handes, their horse trappers of blacke Ueluet,
their taberdes, hattes, &amp; trappers set with scaloppe schelles of fyne
golde, and strippes of blacke Ueluet, euery s
                     •
                  rip set with a scalop shell,
their seruaūtes all in blacke Satyn, with scalop shelles of gold in their
breastes. Sone after came in the lord Henry of Buckyngham Erle of
Wylshire, hym selfe and his horse appareiled in cloth of siluer, enbroudered
with a posye, or his worde, and arrowes of golde in a posye, called
La ma
                        •
                     son du refuge, made of Crymosyn damaske, broudered with Roses
and arrowes of golde, on the tope a greyhonde of siluer, bearinge a
tree of Pomegarnettes of golde, the braunches thereof were so large
that it ouer sprede the pagent in all partes. Then entred syr Gyles Capell,
syr Roulande with many other knightes, rychely armed and appareiled.
And thus beganne the Iustes, whiche was valiauntly acheued
by the kyng and his aydes, emōges whome hys grace atteyned ye price.
These Iustes fynished, euery man with drew, the kynge was disarmed,
&amp; at time cōuenient he and the Quene heard euēsong, and that night all
the Ambassadours supped with the kyng, &amp; had a great banket. After

soupper, hys grace with the Quene, lordes and ladyes came into the
white Hall, within the sayde Pallays, whiche was hanged rychely, the
Hall was sca
                     •
                  olded and ray
                     •
                  ed on all partes. There was an interlude
of the gentelmen of hys chapell before his grace, and diuers freshe songes:
that done, hys grace called to hym a great man, or a lord of Irelād
called Odouell, whome in the presence of the sayde Ambassadours, he
made knyght: then the mynstrels beganne to playe, the lordes and ladyes
beganne to daunce.
               And in the moste of this pastyme, when all persones were moste attē
                  tyue
to beholde the daunsyng, the king was sodenly gone vnknowen to
the moste parte of the people there, oneles it were of the Quene &amp; of certayne
other. Within a littell while after hys departing, the trompettes
at thende of the Hall began to blow. Then was there a deuice or a pageaūt
vpō wheles brought in, out of the which pageaūt issued out a gē
                  telman
rychelye appareiled, that shewed, howe in a garden of pleasure
there was an arber of golde, wherin were lordes and ladyes, moche desirous
to shew pleasure and pastyme to the Quene and ladyes, if they
might be licenced so to do, who was aunswered by the Quene, how she
and all other there were very desyrous to se theim and their pastyme:
then a great cloth of Arras that dyd hang before thesame pageaūt was
taken awaye, &amp; the pageaunt brought more nere, it was curiously made
and pleasaūt to beholde, it was solempne and ryche, for euery post or piller
therof, was cōuered with frise golde, therin were trees of Hathorne,
Eglantynes, Rosiers, Uynes and other pleasaunt floures of diuers colours,
with Gillofers and other herbes all made of Satyn, damaske,
silke, siluer &amp; golde, accordingly as the natural trees, herbes, or floures
ought to be. In which arber were .vi. ladyes, all appareiled in white satyn
and grene, set &amp; enbroudered full of H. &amp; K. of golde, knytte together
with laces of golde, of damaske, &amp; all their garmentes were replenyshed
with glytteringe spangles gylt ouer, on their heddes were bonettes all
opened at the .iiii. quarters, ouerfrysed with flat gold of damaske, ye or
                  
                     •
                  ellettes
were of rolles, wrethed on lampas douck holow, so y• the golde
shewed thorow ye lāpas douck, ye fassis of their head set ful of new deuised
facions: in this gardē, also was the kyng and .v. with him appareiled
in garmētes of purple satyn, all of cuttes wt H. &amp; K. euery edge garnished
with frysed gold, &amp; euery garmēt ful of poysees, made of letters
of fyne gold in bullyō as thicke as they might be, &amp; euery persone had
his name in like letters of massy gold. The fyrst Cuer loyall, The secōd
Bone volure, in the .iii. Bone espoier, The .iiii. Valyaūt desyre, The fyst
Bone foy, The .vi. A moure loyall, their hosē, cappes, &amp; cotes, were full of
poyses &amp; H. &amp; K. of fyne gold in bulliō, so y• the groūde could s
                     •
                  ace apere
&amp; yet was in euery voyde place spāgels of gold. Whētime was come, y•
sayd pageāt was brought forth into presence, &amp; then discēded a lord &amp; a
lady by coples, &amp; then the mynstrels, which were disguised also daūced,
and the lorde &amp; ladyes daunced, that it was a pleasure to beholde.
               
                  
In the meane season the pagiaunt was conueyed to the ende of the
place, there to tary till the daunces were finished, and so to haue receyued
the lordes and ladyes againe, but sodanly the rude people ranne to
the pagent, and rent, tare, and spoyled the pagent, so that the lord Stuard
nor the head officers could not cause them to abstaine, excepte they
shoulde haue foughten and drawen bloude, and soo was this pagent
broken.
               After the kyng and hys cōpaignions had daūced, he appoynted the
ladyes, gentelwomen and the Ambassadours to take the letters of their
garmentes, in token of liberalitie, which thyng the common people perceyuyng▪
ranne to the kyng, and stripped hym into hys hosen and dublet,
and all hys compaignions in likewise. Syr Thomas Kneuet stode
on a stage, and for all his defence he lost hys apparell. The ladyes likewyse
were spoyled, wherfore the kynges garde came sodenly, and putte
the people backe, or els as it was supposed more inconuenience had ensued.
So the kyng with the quene &amp; the ladyes returned to his chamber,
where they had a great banket, and all these hurtes were turned to
laughyng and game, and thought that, all that was taken awaye was
but for honor, and larges: and so this triumphe ended with myrthe and
gladnes. At this banket, a shipeman of London caught certayn letters
which he sould to a goldsmyth for .iii.l.xiiii.s.viii.d. by reason wherof,
it appeared that the garmentes were of a great value.
               After this great ioy came sorowfull chaunce, for the young Prince,
which was borne vpon Newyeres daye last past, vpon the .xxii. daye of
February, beyng then the euē of sainct Mathy, departed this world at
Rychemonde, and from thense was caryed to Westmynster, and buryed.
               The kyng lyke a wyse Prynce, toke this dolorous chaunce wonderous
wysely, and the more to comfort the Quene, he dissimuled the matter,
and made no great mourning outwardely: but the Quene lyke a naturall
woman, made much lamentacion, how be it, by the kynges good
persuasion and behauior, her sorowe was mytigated, but not shortlye.
Thys yere also in the moneth of Februarie, came frō kyng Ferdinādo,
the kynges father in law, and kynge of Arragon and Castell certayne
Ambassadours, whiche made request to the kynge, on the behalfe of the
kyng their mayster, to haue ayde of the kynge of .xv.C. Archers, with
valyaunt Capitaynes to gouerne and conduyte them: For hys entent
was to make warre on the Moores, beynge Infideles and enemies to
Gods law. The kyng and his counsayl hearing this request, thoughte
it muche honorable to ayde a Christian Prynce, and in especiall hys
frende and father in lawe, agaynste the Infideles enemyes to Christes
lawe, wherfore the kyng gentely graunted them their request. When
tydinges were spread in the courte of this iorney agaynst the infideles,
the lorde Thomas Darcye, knyght of the order of the gartier, made hū
                  ble
suyte to the kynge, to be capitayne general of that Crewe or armye.

The kyng and hys counsayll for hys great valiantnes and approued
wysedome graunted hys request: many lordes &amp; knyghtes made suyte
to be in thesame iorney, but the kyng answered them, y• he retayned them
still for other greater consideracions and purposes. There were apoynted
to go with the sayd lord Darcie, lord Anthony Grey, brother to the
Marques Dorset, Henry Guyldeford, Westō, Broune, Wiliam Sydney,
Esquyers of the kynges house, syr Robert cōstable, syr Roger Haystynges,
and syr Raufe Elderkare, and diuers other gentelmē to be capitaynes.
The lord Darcie and all the other capitaynes toke their leue
of the kyng, and went into their countreys to prouide for all thinges,
mete and necessarie for the voiage.
               The kynge thys tyme was moche entysed to playe at tennes and at
dice, which appetite, certayn craftie persones about hym perceyuynge,
brought in Frenchmen and Lombardes, to make wagers with hym, &amp;
so he lost moch money, but when he perceyued their crafte, he exchuyd
their compaignie, and let them go. The kyng beyng lustye, young, &amp; coragious,
greatly delited in feates of chyualrie, in so moch that he made
a chalenge of Iustes, agaynst all cōmers to be proclaimed at his mannoure
of Grenewyche, to be holden there the .iii. first dayes of May then
next ensuyng, which noble courage, all yonge persones highly praysed,
but the auncient fathers moch doubted, consideringe the tender youth
of the kyng, and diuers chaunces of horses and a
                     •••
                  re: in so moch that
it was openly spoken, that stele was not so stronge, but it might be broken
nor no horse coulde be so sure of fote, but he maye fall: Yet for all
these doubtes, the lusty prince proceded in his chalenge.
               The first daye of Maye the kynge accompaignied with many lusty
Batchelers, on greate and well doyng horses rode to the wodde to fetch
May, where a man might haue seen many a horse raysed on highe wyth
galope, turne and stoppe, meruaylous to behold: where he and .iii. other
as syr Edward Haward, Charles Brandon, and Edward Neuel, which
were chalengers with the kyng, shyfted them selfes into cotes of grene
Satyn, garded with Crymosyn Ueluet. On the other parte the Earles
of Essex, of Deuenshyre, the Marques Dorset, the lorde Haward, were
all in Crymosyn Satyn, garded with a poūced garde of grene Ueluet:
and as they were retornyng on the Hyll▪ mete with them a shippe vnder
sayle: The master hayled the kyng and that noble compaignie, &amp; sayde
that he was a Maryner, and was come from many a straunge porte, &amp;
came hither to se if any dedes of armes were to be done in the countrey,
of the whiche he mighte make report thereof in other countreys. An Heraulde
demaunded the name of his shippe, he aunswered she is called
Fame, and is laden with good Renoune: Then sayde the Heraulde, if
you wil bring your shippe into the bay of Hard
                        •
                     nes, you must double y•
poynt of Ge
                        ••••
                     nes, and there you shall se a compaignie that will medle
with your merchaundise. Then sayd the kyng, sythen Renowne is their
merchaundyse, let vs bye it and we can: Then the shippe shotte a pele of

Ennys, and sayled forthe before the kynges compaignie, ful of flagges
and banners, till it came to the tylte year
                     •
                  e. At after nonne, the kyng &amp;
his thre felowes entred into the felde, their bardes and bases of Crimosyn
and blew Ueluet, cut in quadrāt cuttes, embroudered full of Pomgranettes,
and all the wayters, in sylke of thesame colour. The other
partie were in Crymsyn Satyn and grene Ueluet. Then beganne the
trompettes to sounde, and the horses to runne that many a spere was
brast, and many a great strype geuen: and for a trueth the kyng exceded
in nūber of staues all other, euery daye of the .iii. dayes. Wherfore on y•
iii. day, the Quene made a great bāket to the kyng, &amp; all them that had
Iusted: &amp; after the bāket done, she gaue ye chefe pryce to the kyng, the .ii.
to the Erle of Essex, the .iiii. to y• erle of Deuōshyre, &amp; the .iii. to the lord
Marques Dorset. Then ye Herauldes cryed, my lordes, for your noble
feates in armes, God sende you y• loue of your ladies ye you most desire.
            
            
               ¶The iii yere.
               
                  THe king euer desirous to serue Mars, begā another Iustes ye
xv. day of ye sayd moneth: ye kyng &amp; his bend were all in grene
sylke▪ &amp; ye erle of Essex &amp; his bende in blew, garded with gold,
&amp; all y• speres were paynted of thesame colours. There was
good rūning &amp; many a spere brast, but for all y• sport euery man feared,
lest some yll chaūce might happē to the kyng, &amp; fayne would haue had
him a loker on, rather then a doer, &amp; spake therof as much as thei durst:
but his courage was so noble that he would euer be at the one ende.
               In this passe tyme, the lord Darcy &amp; other appoynted to the vyage
agaynst the Moores of Barbaria (at the instaunce of Dōpefernādo rather
to the Quene) made suche diligence, that they and all their people
were ready at Plymmouth by the middes of May, and there mustered
their souldiers before the lorde Broke, and other the kinges commissioners.
The sayde lord Darcie, as capitayne generall ordeyned for hys
Prouost Marshal, Henry Guylford Esquier, a lusty yongmā, and wel
beloued of the kyng. Then, when the winde serued to their purpose, and
all the armye were set aborde in their shippes, whiche were vytaled and
prest at all poyntes, the Capitayne and other departed out of Plymmouth
hauē, the monday in the Rogaciō weke with .iiii. shippes Royal
and the wynde was so fauourable to them, that the firste daye of Iune,
beynge the euen of the feast of Pentecost, he arriued at the porte of Caleys
in Southspayne, and immediatly by the aduice of his counsayll,
dispatched to the kyng of Arragon two Gentilmen, called Ihon Barthelmew,
and William Symonde, with letters to certefie the king and
his counsayll of their arriuall, and what payne they had taken to come
to his countrey, in fulfilling the kyng their maisters commaundement.
The messingers did so moch that they came to the kyng, beside the citie
of Cyuill, where he then lay, and declared to hym how the lord Darcie
by the kyng their maisters apoyntement, was come thither with .xvi.C
archers mo, according to the sayd kyng of Arragons request, and laye

still at Caleys to know his pleasure. The kyng of Arragon aunswered
them gentelly▪ that the lord Darcie and all other that were come from
hys most best beloued sonne were welcome▪ and hartely thanked theim
of their paynes, and prayed the messengers to retorne to their capitaine
shewing hym that the kyng in all haste would sende his coūsail to him,
and so they departed from the kyng, and made reporte to the lord Darcie,
which kept his shippe in great estate, and would not lāde, but onely
suffered such as were sicke and feble, and few other to go a lande.
               The Englishmē which went a lande, fell to drinking of hote wynes
and were scace maisters of theim selfes, some ranne to the stewes, some
brake hegges, and spoyled orchardes &amp; vyneyardes, and orynges before
they were ripe, and did many other outragious dedes: wherfore y•
che
                     •
                  e of the toune of Caleys, came to complaine to the lorde Darcie in
hys shippe, which sent forth his Prouost Marshal, which scacelie with
peyne re
                     •
                  rayned the yomen archers, they were so hote and wil
                     •
                  ull, yet
by cōmaundement and policie, they were all brought on borde on their
shippes.
               Saterdaye the .viii. daye of Iune, the Bishop of &amp; other
of the kynges counsayll, arryued at Caleys, and there abode tyll wednysdaye,
beyng the euen of Corpus Christi, at which daye the lord Capitayne
toke lande, and was honorably receyued of the kynge of Arragons
counsayl▪ and on the morrow highly fe
                     ••
                  ed at dynner and supper.
And after supper, the bishop declared the kynge of Arragons pleasure
saiyng my lord Capitayne▪ the kyng my maister in moste humble wys
                     •
                  
geueth you thankes for your greate paynes and trauell, as mo
                     •
                  he as
though he proceded in this pretensed enterprice, but he with the aduice
of his counsaill circumspectly, considering the suertie of his awne realmes
and dominions hathe perfectie knowlege, that his aduersarye of
Fraunce, prepareth to inuade hys coūtreis in hys absence: wher
                     •
                  ore he
entending not to leue his Realmes, voyde of men and shippes (whiche
might be a great comfort to his enemyes to inuade) &amp; therfore he hathe
taken an abstinence of warre with the Moores tyll another time. Well
saieth the lorde Darcie, sythe it is fully concluded that we shall do no
seruice to their maister, we maye not saye agaynst his determinacion, cōsidering
we were sent to him, but surely it is agaynste my hart, whiche
euer hath desired to fight agaynst Gods enemyes, but with your conclusion,
I and all myne must be content. You do as you should do, said
the Bishop, and the kyng my maister geueth like thankes to the kynge
his sonne, and to you all, as though he had proceded in his iorney. And
you shall haue wages for all your souldiers: and if it shall please you
to come to the court, you shall receyue high thankes of the kyng, &amp; such

                     •
                  here as there can be made you. That is not my desire sayed the lorde
Darcie, for my men shal not say that I brought them out of their coū
                  trie,
and now to do my selfe pleasure, leaue theim without an hedde, as
men of men forsaken: nay nay my lorde, the kynges banket is not my

desire. So the lordes departed for y• night, &amp; the next day in the mornyng
was sent wages, to conduict tharmie into England, with diuerse giftes
geuen to the lord Darcie, &amp; other gentle men: Yet ye notwithstandyng, he
was highly displeased, how beit like a wise man he dissimuled ye matter.
               Thesame daie, beyng the .xiiii. daie of Iune and Fridaie, an Englishe
manne desired of a maide, that had been at the Bakers to bye bread for
her maistres store and not to sell, to haue a lofe for his money, she aunswered,
that she had none to sell, he said he would haue one, and folowed
her, and when she perceiued that, she cried, a force a force, the tounes men
of Caleis, or Caleis males, sodainly rong their common bell, and all the
toune went to harneis, and the fewe Englishmen that wer on lande wēt
to their bowes. The Spaniardes cast dartes, and sore anoyed and hurt
the Englishmen: and thei likewise hurte and slew diuerse Spanyardes.
Then the Capitaines of Englande for their parte, and the lordes of the
Counsaill for their parte, toke suche pain, that the fraie was seased, and
but one Englisheman slain, and of the Spanyardes diuerse slain.
               Then all Englishe menne were commaunded to go aborde with their
shippes. The lordes of Spayne came to the lorde Darcie, saiyng: Sir,
we praie you, sithe you knowe the kynges pleasure and haue your wages,
that you with all your people will go with your shippes awaie, for
we perceiue you owe vs some displeasure. Then he boldly answered saiyng,
that he would all the worlde knewe, that he was as able to condu
                     •
                  t
his menne homewarde, as he was to bryng theim out of their countrey,
without the kyng of Arragōs wages, (sauyng his honor) and as for the

                     •
                  raie, it was against his will and without his knowlege: and so that
night he and all his men, went aborde with their shippes.
               When this iorney was come to this poynt, Henry Guilforde, Westō,
Browne, and Willyam Sidney, young and lustie Esqutres, desired license
to see the Courte of Spayne, whiche was to theim graunted: and
then thei departed from Caleis, and came to the Courte of the kyng of
Arragon, where thei wer highly entertained, &amp; he dubbed Henry Guildford,
West
                     •
                  n, and Browne, knightes, and gaue to sir Henry Guilforde,
a Canton of Granado, &amp; to sir Westō, and Browne, and Egle of Scicile
on a cheffe to the augmentacion of their armes: William Sidney, so excused
himself, that he was not made knight, and when thei had soiornied
there a while, thei tooke their leaue of the kyng and quene, &amp; so returned
through Fraunce into England, where thei demained thēselfes so, y• thei
had the kynges fauoure, notwithstandyng it was thought contrary.
               Duryng whiche season the lorde Darcie, the .xvii. daie of Iune made
saile towarde Englande, and arriued at Plimmouthe, and came to the
kyng at Wyndsore, and in August thus ended this voyage.
               Duryng the tyme that the Lorde Darcie was in Spayne, the Ladie
Margaret Duches of Sauoy, &amp; daughter to Maximilian themperor,
and gouernor of the countreis of Flaunders, Brabant, Holland, Zelāde
and other the lowe countreis apperteinyng to Charles the yong prince

of Castell, then beeyng of tendre age, sent in thende of Maij to the kyng
of England to haue .xv.c. archers, to aide her against y• duke of Geldres
which sore trobled the coūtreis aforsaid. The kyng tendrely regardyng
the request of so noble a lady, &amp; also because there was a communicaciō
hangyng at their tyme of mariage, to be had betwene the young Prince
Charles, and the lady Marie his sister, moste iently graūted her request,
and appoynted sir Edward Pounynges knight of the garter, and cōptroller
of his house, a valiant capitain &amp; a noble warrior, to be the lieuetenaunt
&amp; conducter of thesaid .xv.c. archers, whiche accōpaignied with
the lord Clyntō his sonne in lawe, sir Mathew Broune, sir Ihon Dighby,
Ihon Werton, Richard Whethrill, Sherley Esquires &amp; diuerse tal
gentlemen and yomen, well knowen men and tried, to thesaid nombre of
xv.c. toke their shippyng a mile beside Sādwiche, the .xviii. daie of Iuly,
&amp; landed at Armew the .xix. daie, not without some troble by reason of
a litle storme, &amp; sent Lancastre Herauld to auertise the lady of their arriuall,
whiche sent to thē lord Bresley knight of the Toyson, and diuerse
other to welcome thē, and so conduited thē to Barow, where the lorde of
the toune made them greate chere. And thesame day at after noone, came
the lady Margaret to Barow, where y• capitain with all his vnder capitaines
receiued her at the gate, she welcomed thē hartely, &amp; so she did all
the souldiers whiche stode a long reinged in the strete. And on saterdaie
beyng the .xxvi. daie of Iuly, she sawe all the cōpaignie shote, &amp; thesame
night the capitain and other toke his leaue of her, &amp; the morowe beeyng
sondaie departed to Rossindale, and so on thursday the last daie of Iuly
came to Buldike, &amp; that daie the ladie Margaret came thether. And the
next day, the whole armie of Almaines, Flemynges, and other apperteinyng
to thesaied lady, met with thenglishemen without Buldike, where
the
                     •
                   set furth in ordre, the lady Margaret beyng present: which toke her
leue of all the capitaines and departed to Buldike, whom sir Edwarde
Pounynges conduited to the toune gate, and after returned to tharmie.
Tharmie to the nombre of .x.M. of the ladies part, &amp; .xv.c. Englishmen
passed through Brabant, &amp; came the .x. daie of August beyng .s. Laurēce
daie, before a litle castle stādyng on the higher side of the riuer of Mase
called Brymuoyst strongly bulwarked, in the whiche wer .c. men belongyng
to the bastarde of Gelders, with a capitain called Lankessell van
Gelder, whiche robbed &amp; spoyled all the parties of Brabāt. Thei within
shot fiercely at tharmy as it passed by, and did them litle hurt. Thesame
night Thomas Hert chief gouernor of thēglish part, made his approch
of his ordinaūce, &amp; in the mornyng bet doune as much as might be beaten
doune for the bulwarkes, &amp; the next daie beyng the .xi. of August the
castle was assaulted valiantly, &amp; takē by force, &amp; the capitain and .lxxx. &amp;
odde men wer slain &amp; .xix. taken, of the which xi. wer hanged, Ihon Mor
tō capitain of .c. Englishmē, &amp; one Guiot an esquire of Burgoin criyng
Burgoyne. S. George: there was one Englisheman slain and no more.
               On thursdaie the .xiiii. daie, tharmie feried oeur the riuer of Mase in

to the land of Geldres, and their soiornied at a litle churche, of our ladie
daie the Assumpcion that night, and the nexte daie thei came to a toune
called Aiske, belongyng to the Bastarde Geldres, where all the people
wer fled, and there was vndermined and caste doune, a litle castle standyng
of thesaid riuer newly edified.
               The .xx. of August thei brent the toune of Aiske, and brent al the coū
                  trey
aboute, and came at last to a toune called Straulle, a strong toune
double diked &amp; walled, and within it .iii.C.lx. good men of warre beside
the inhabitauntes, whiche at the firste commyng shot Gonnes fiercely
and hurte many, and there thei planted their siege.
               Sir Edward Pounynges, whiche euer was in the forward with his
archers, caused fagottes to be made, and trenches to be digged and cast
and his men wer so diligent, that his trenche, in the mornyng approched
so nye the toune gate, that thei within wer halfe dismaied: and desired to
speake with the Lordes, and so thei did. And on. S. Barthelmewes euen,
were sixe men sent out of the toune to treate, and sixe hostages deliuered
for theim, and then it was agreed that all men of warre should departe
with a white sticke in their handes, &amp; to 
                     •
                  orfet all other thynges, and all
the toune dwellers to bee prisoners at the will of the Prince of Castle.
The next daie, after the men of warre wer departed, erly in the mornyng
sir Ihon Dighby knight, and Ihon Norton Esquire, toke possession of
the toune with .CC. Englishe menne: and at after None the Admirall of
Flaunders, sir Edward Pounynges, &amp; the lorde Discilstain, chief capitaines
of tharmie, with all other noble men, with Trūpettes, &amp; Arthoys
and Lancastre, and Ostriche, officers at armes in their coates of armes
before theim gorgeously appareied, entered the toune, and in the toune
hall, toke thothe of thinhabitantes, and y• night returned to their armie.
               The .xxvi. daie of thesame moneth, sir Ihon Dighby, and Ihon Norton,
came out of the toune with all their Englishmen, and for them entered
a capitain called Yonker Otes, with .CC.l. Almaines, to kepe there
a garrison, the whiche daie the armie went before Uenlow &amp; sent Artoys
with a trumpet to somon the toune: but thei would not here them speke▪
but shot gunnes at theim. The .xxviii. daie, the armie remoued vnto the
Northside of Uenlow, and part went ouer the water and made trenches
to the water. The capitain of the Englishemen made trenches euen to
the toune diche, and the artilerie bet doune the towers of the walles, and
euery daie was some skirmishe. And the .xxix. daie as certain Englishemen
went a foragyng, it happened .x. of sir Ihon Dighbes men to go .v.
mile from the armie, and to mete with .xxiiii. horsmen of Geldres which
set on them, but thei withdrew themselfes into a litle garden, and shot at
their enemies, and slewe twoo horsemen and .v. horses, gauled and hurte
many of thē, discomfited the remnant, and brought two greate horses to
tharmie, and euery man was sore hurte, but in no perell of death thāked
be God. The siege thus continuyng, not without skirmishes xxix. daies
sir Edward Pounynges, sir Ihon Dighby dined with monsire de Rony

and all other Englishe capitaines, and petie Capitaines, dined with an
Almain called Clene Anderlyne, except sir Mathew Broune, and Ihon
Fogge whiche kepte the felde, and Richard Wethill whiche kepte the
trenche and was sore besette: and in the dinner tyme, thei of the toune issued
out on thenglishemen, and hurte and toke, one Sheldwiche of Cā
                  terbury
prisoner, and one Miles: and thenglishmen hurt and slewe many
of theim, and compelled theim to returne by force of Arrowes, and so
thei reculed with one prisoner. For Miles, whiche was led betwene two
of the Gelders, perceiuyng rescue commyng, after as he came to an hill,
thurst the two Gelders doune the hill before hym, and so ranne backe to
his compaignie, which thyng the two Gelders that led hym perceiuyng
ranne to Sheldwiche and slew him. The Burgonions perceiuyng, that
sir Edwarde Pownynges was displeased with this chaunce, exhorted
hym with his menne to assault the toune, whiche by thaduise of bastard
Emery answered that the cause was theirs, and not his Maisters: and
if he gatte the toune by assault, the kyng his Master should not haue it,
but if thei would geue the assaulte, he would ioyne with theim, whiche
thyng thei would not do, because thei had kinsemen and frendes, within
the toune: sauyng one daie a fewe Almaines assaulted a Bulwerke, and
wer slain and taken.
               The Englishe capitaines perceiuyng that thei laye there in vain, cō
                  sideryng
the strength of the toune, and also how their armie was not in
nombre to enuiron the toune, for euer thei had one Gate open, wrote to
the kyng▪ whiche willed them with all spede to returne, and so thei did.
               Sir Edward Pownynges went to the Court of Burgoyn, where he
was highly enterteined of the young prince, &amp; the Lady Margaret his
aunte, and receiued great thākes and giftes for his pain. And other cacapitaines,
as sir Ihon Norton, sir Ihon Fogge, sir Ihon Scot, and sir
Thomas Lind, were made knightes of the Prince. And the lady Margaret,
perceiuyng the coates of the souldiers to bee foule with liyng on
the ground, (for euery man lay not in a tent) gaue to euery yoman, a cote
of wollen clothe of yelowe, red, white and grene coloures, not to her litle
laude and praise emong thenglishmen. After that sir Edward pounynges
had been highly feasted, and more praised of all men for his valiantnes,
and good ordre of his people, he returned with his cōpaignie into
England, and had lost by warre and sickenes, not fully an .C. persones.
               When the Englishemen were departed, Geldres issued out daily, and
made skirmisshes and fraies with the Burgonions, and asked for their
Archers, and Wynter beganne sharpely to approche, and by aboundaunce
of rayne the riuer of the Masse roase so high, that the Trenches
were drouned, and of force menne were compelled to remoue. And when
the Capitaynes considered the strengthe of the Towne, howe it was
fortified, victayled and manned, and howe by the rysyng of the
Ryuer it was made stronger: thei determined to rayse the Siege,
and too burne and destroye all the Uillages and Townes aboute,

of the whiche toune of Uēlow, should haue succor in winter, and to mete
again, at the Prime tyme of the yere. Thus was the siege raised, and the
countrey wasted and spoyled, and then euery capitain returned home.
               In Iune the kyng beyng at Leicester, tidynges wer brought to hym,
that Andrew Barton a Scottishe manne, and a pirate of the sea, saiyng
that the kyng of Scottes, had warre with the Portingales, did rob euery
nacion, &amp; so stopped the kynges stremes, that no merchauntes almost
could passe, and when he toke thenglishemenes goodes, he said thei wer
Portyngales goodes, and thus he haunted and robbed at euery hauēs
mouthe. The kyng moued greately with this craftie pirate, sent sir Edmond
Haward lord Admirall of England, and lorde Thomas Haward
sonne and heire to therle of Surrey, in all the hast to the sea, whiche, hastely
made redy two shippes, and without any more abode, toke the sea,
and by chaunce of wether were seuered. The lorde Haward liyng in the
Dounes, perceiued where Andrew was making toward Scotlāde, and
so fast thesaied lorde chased him, that he ouer tooke hym, and there was
a sore battaill: thenglishmen wer fierce, and the Scottes defended them
manfully, and euer Andrew blewe his whistell to encorage his men, yet
for al that, the lorde Haward and his men, by cleane s
                     •
                  rength entred the
mayne decke: then the Englishemen entered on all sides, and the Scottes
foughte sore on the hatches, but in conclusion, Andrewe was taken,
whiche was so sore wounded, that he died there: then all the remnaunte
of the Scottes wer taken, with their shippe called the Lion.
               Al this while, was the lord Admirall in chace of the Barke of Scotlande,
called Ienny Pirwyn, whiche was wont to saile with the Lion in
compaignie, and so muche did he with other, that he laied hym on borde,
and fiercely assailed hym, and the Scottes as hardy and well stomaked
men them defended, but the lorde Admirall so encoraged his menne, that
thei entered the Barke and slewe many, and toke all the other.
               Thus wer these two shippes taken, and brought to Blacke Wal, the
seconde daie of August, and all the Scottes were sent to the Bishoppes
place of Yorke, and there remained at the kynges charge, til other direccion
was taken for theim.
               After this, the kyng sent the bishop of Winchester, and certain of his
counsaill to tharchebishop of Yorkes place, where the Scottes wer prisoners:
&amp; there the bishop rehersed to thē, wher as peace was yet betwene
England and Scotland, that thei contrary to that, as theues &amp; pirates,
had robbed the kynges subiectes within his stremes, wherfore, thei had
deserued to die by the law, &amp; to be hanged at the low water marke. Then
said the Scottes, we knowlege our oftence, &amp; aske mercie &amp; not the lawe.
Then a priest, which was also a prisoner said, my lordes we appele from
the kinges iustice to his mercy. Then the bishop asked him, if he wer aucthorised
by thē to say so, &amp; thei cried al yea yea, then said he, you shal find
y• kinges mercy, aboue his iustice. For wher you wer ded by ye law yet by
his mercy he wil reuiue you, wherfore, you shal depart out of this realme

within .xx. daies, vpon pain of death, if you bee founde after the .xx. daie,
and praie for the kyng, and so thei passed into the Countrey.
               The kyng of Scottes, hearyng of the death of Andrewe of Barton,
and takyng of his twoo shippes, was wonderfull wrothe, and sent letters
to the kyng, requiryng restitucion, accordyng to the league and amitie.
The kyng wrote with brotherly salutaciōs, to the kyng of Scottes,
of the robberies and euill dooynges of Andrew Barton, and that it
became not one Prince, to laie a breache of a league, to another Prince,
in doyng Iustice vpon a pirate or thiefe, and that all the other Scottes
that were taken, had deserued to dye by Iustice, if he had not extended
his mercie: &amp; with this answere, the Scottishe Herauld departed home.
               Duryng this season, there began greate warre, betwene Pope Iuly,
and the Frenche kyng, Loys the .xii: the occasion beganne by one Ihon
Bentiuoyle, a greate lorde of Italie, whiche kepte the citee of Boloignele
Grace, from the Pope, whiche, by the aide of the Frenche kyng, gatte
thesaied citee, from the forenamed Ihon Bentiuoyle: but afterward because
thesaid Pope Iuly, tooke peace with the Uenecians, the Frenche
kyng turned from the Pope, and made warre on hym, in the behalfe of
Ihon Bentiuoyle, and toke from hym again, thesaid citee of Boloigne.
               The kyng of Englande, wrote often to kyng Loys of Fraunce, to desist
from the persecutyng of the Pope, whiche was his frende and confederate:
to whiche writyng he gaue litle regard, wherefore, the kyng sent
hym woorde, to deliuer hym his lawfull enheritaunce, bothe of the Duchie
of Normādie and Guyan, and the countreis of Aniow and Mayne
and also of his Croune of Fraunce, els he would come with suche a power,
that by fine force he would obtein his purpose. For all these writinges,
the Frenche kyng still made warre in Italie, and the kyng could of
hym, haue no certain nor determinate answere. Wherefore, after greate
deliberacion had, by the aduise of his counsaill, he determined to make
warre on the Frenche kyng, and his Countreis, and called to hym Maximilian
the Emperor, and Ferdinand kyng of Arragon, and diuerse other
princes, and made preparacion, bothe by sea and by lande, and fortified
his frontiers against Fraunce, and set furth shippes to the sea, for
defence of his merchauntes, whiche wer daily in ieoperdy, vnder a pretensed
peace of the Frenche kyng, Lewes the .xii.
               The kyng this yere, kep
                     •
                   the reast of Christmas at Grenewiche, wher
was suche abundaunce of viādes serued, to all comers of any honest behauor,
as hath been fewe times seen. And against Newyeres night, was
made in the halle a Castle, gates, towers, and dungion, garnished with
artilerie, and weapon after the moste warlike fashion: and on the frount
of the castle, was written le Fortresse dangerus, and within the castle wer
vi. Ladies, clothed in Russet Satin, laide all ouer with leues of Golde,
and euery owde, knit with laces of blewe silke and golde. On their heddes,
coyfes, and cappes all of gold.
               After this castle had been caried about the hal, and the quene had behelde

it, in came the kyng with fiue other, appareled in coates, the one
halfe of russet satyn, spangeld with spangels of fine gold, the other halfe
riche clothe of gold, on their heddes cappes of russet satin, embroudered
with workes of fine gold bulliō. These vi. assaulted the castle, the ladies
seyng them so lustie and coragious, wer content to solace with them, and
vpon farther communicacion, to yeld the castle, and so thei came doune
and daunced a long space. And after the ladies led the knightes into the
castle, and then the castle sodainly vanished, out of their sightes.
               On the daie of the Epiphanie at night, the kyng with a .xi. other were
disguised, after the maner of Italie, called a maske, a thyng not seen afore
in Englande, thei were appareled in garmentes long and brode,
wrought all with gold, with visers and cappes of gold, &amp; after the banket
doen, these Maskers came in, with sixe gentlemen disguised in silke
bearyng staffe torches, and desired the ladies to daunce, some were content,
and some that knewe the fashion of it refused, because it was not a
thyng commonly seen. And after thei daunced, and commoned together,
as the fashion of the Maske is, thei tooke their leaue and departed, and
so did the Quene, and all the ladies.
               The .xv. daie of Ianuarij began the Parliament, where the Bisshop
of Cantorburie, began his oracion with this verse, Iusticia &amp; pax osculate sunt,
vpon whiche, he declared how Iustice should bee ministered, and
peace should bee nourished, and by what meanes, Iustice was put by,
and peace 
                     •
                  nrned into warre. And there vpon he shewed, how the Frēche
kyng would do no Iustice, in restoryng the kyng his right enhe
                     •••
                  aūce,
wherefore, for lacke of Iustice, peace of necessitie must turne to warre.
               In this Parliament was graunted, twoo fiftenes of the temporaltie,
and of the clergie twoo dismes: Duryng whiche Parliament, one Newbolt
yoman of the kynges Garde, whom, the kyng highly fauored, slewe
wilfully a seruaunt of my lorde Willoughbies, in the palaice at Westminster,
wherefore, the kyng abhorryng that deede, and settyng a side al
affeccion, caused hym to be hāged, in the Palaice of Westminster, where
he hong twoo daies, in example of other.
               In this season, one Iherome Bonuise, whiche was borne in Luke,
and was a factor in London for Merchauntes of that nacion, and had
plaied Bankroute, and was conueighed out of the realme for debt, was
nowe in suche fauor with Pope Iuly, that he made hym his Collector,
and Proctor in Englande: and so he kept a greate porte, and resorted to
the kyng and his coūsaill, for the Popes affaires, (whiche then was sore
troubled by the Frenche kyng) so that he knewe, bothe the Popes counsaill,
and the kynges, and falsly and vntruly, resorted by nighte, to the
Frenche Ambassadors, liyng in London, and to theim discouered, what
the kyng and the Pope entended, whiche was not so closly doen, but the
king knewe it: and so he was laied for, and was taken commonyng, with
one of thesaid Ambassadors, vpon Londō wall at midnight, &amp; brought
to the Tower, where he remained, till by the suite of his frendes, he was

deliuered, and shortly for shame, voyded the realme.
               After that it was concluded, by the body of the Realme, in the high
Courte of Parliament assembled, that warre should bee made on the
Frenche kyng and his dominions, the kyng with all diligence caused
newe shippes to be made and repaired, and rigged the old, caused Gonnes,
Bowes, Arrowes, and all other artilery, and instrumentes of warre
to be made, in suche nombre and quantitee, that it was wonderfull to se
what thynges wer doen, bothe for sea and lande in so shorte space.
               The kyng of Arragon, whiche also had warre with the French kyng,
and hearyng that his sonne the kyng of England would make warre in
Fraūce, did write to hym that the duchie of Euyan, was his true enheritaunce,
whiche, adioyned to his coūtrey of Biskey: wherfore, if the kyng
of Englande would entende to recouer his Duchy first, and send an armie
of men to Biskaye, and so to begin at Bayon, whiche is the keye of
Guyan, he would aide them with ordinaunce, horsemen, and beastes for
cariages, with other necessaries apperteignyng to thesame.
               The kyng and his counsaill, puttyng their affiaunce in the promise
of the kyng of Arragon, prepared a noble armie all of 
                     •
                  otemen, and smal
ordinaunce, trustyng to the kyng of Arragon for aide of horsemen and
greate ordinaunce, and of thesame made capitain, the noble lorde Thomas
Grey Marques of Dorset, to whom, he assigned many other gentlemen,
as you shall here after in the next yere.
            
            
               ¶The .iiii. yere.The .iiii. yere.
               
               
                  THE kyng greatly studiyng, to furnishe furthe his warre,
whiche he had begonne against the Frenche kynge, caused
sir Edwarde Hawarde his Admirall, with all diligence to
take the sea, whiche, with all spede possible made ready diuerse
goodly and tall shippes, as the souereigne and other
to the nombre of .xviii. beside litle shippes: and in his compaignie were
Capitaines, sir Weston Browne, Griffith Doune, Edwarde Cobham,
Thomas Wyndam, Thomas Lucie, Willyam Pirton, Henry Shirborne,
Stephen Bull, George Witwange, Ihon Hopton, Willyam
Gimstone, Thomas Draper, Edmond Coke, Ihō Brodet, with diuerse
other. When all these were shipped, thei sailed to Douer, and skowred
the seas, and so came before Portesmouthe, aboute the middes of Maie.
               The third daie of Maie, a gentleman of Flaunders, called Guyot of
Guy, came to the kyng, with .v.C. Almaines all in white, whiche was
cutte so small, that it could soace hold together. After thei had mustered
at Blacke Hethe, the kyng made hym knight, and gaue hym a greate
chayne, and yerely pencion, and sent hym with his band to Southampton.
About midde Maie, the lorde Marques and other noble men, appoynted
by the kyng for the iorney of Biskay, as the Lorde Hawarde,
sonne and heire to the erle of Surrey, the Lorde Broke, the Lorde Willoughby,
the Lorde Ferrers, the lorde Ihon, the lorde Anthony, and the

the lorde Leonard Grey, all three brethren to the Marques, sir Griffith
App Rice, sir Morreis Barkeley, sir Willyam Sandes, the Baron of
Burfford, sir Richard Cornwall his brother, Willyam Huse, Ihō Melton,
Willyam Kyngston Esquires, sir Henry Willoughby, and diuerse
other with souldiours, to the nombre of .x.M. men, came to Southampton
and there mustered. To se the lordes and gentlemen, so well armed
and so richely appareled in clothes of gold, and of siluer, and Ueluettes
of sundery coloures, pounsed and enbr
                     •
                  udered, and all petie capitaines
in Satin and damaske, of white and grene, and yomen in clothe of thesame
coloures. The Baners, Penons, Standerdes, and Gittons, freshe
and newly painted, with sundery beastes and deuises, it was a pleasure
to behold. And when sir Willyam Sandes knight, appoynted Threasorer
for the warres had paied all the wages, then euery man was commaunded
to his shippe. Then you should haue seen byndyng of males,
and fardelles, trussyng of coffers and trussers, that no manne was idle:
and so on the .xvi. daie, all the armie wer shipped in Spanishe shippes,
vitailed for that iorney, and passed the Nedles of Wight all thesame
daie▪ and so did the Lorde Admirall, whiche laie abidyng the wynde at
Portesmouth, and toke his course to Britain, of whō I will speke after.
               The wynde serued the Marques and his compaigne so well, that he
with his whole armie arriued in Biskay, at a Porte called Passagh,
Southe West of Fountrabie. The thirde daie of Iune, the lorde Marques
and all his faire compaignie landed, and tooke the felde, and hym
wisely embattailed for his sauegard. The Biskaynes that brought vitaile
to the armie, saied to the souldiours: Sirs you bee arriued her, in
trust that the kyng of Arragon will helpe you with ordinaunce and cariages,
we here no preparacion that he maketh, nor neuer sent vs worde
to prepare for your commyng, of the whiche wee maruell muche. These
wordes ranne daily through the hoste, whiche made many men sad &amp; to
muse: and the Biskanes sore feared, least thenglishemen would destroye
their countrey, because their kyng kepte not promise with theim, but the
Marques made suche streight Proclamacion, that no souldiour durste
do any iniurie to them. Within three daies after that the armie had lien
in the feld, there came to him an erle, and another noble man, to welcome
hym and his compaignie. Then the Lorde capitain remoued his felde,
and toke another place nerer Fountraby, more plenteous of water and
woodde, and there pitched his felde, euery daie lookyng for aide of the
kyng of Arragon, but he harde of none. Then he called a Counsaill, and
deuised how thei might haue beastes to draw ordinaunce and cariages
then one sir Ihon Stile an Englisheman, caused to be bought twoo .C.
Mulettes an Asses, of suche price as the Spanyardes gayned greatly,
and when thei were putte to cary, thei would neither bere nor drawe, for
thei wer beastes whiche wer not exercised a fore. Then the Lorde Marques
muche lamented that chaunce, for if he had had redy two hundred
drawyng beastes, he might haue runne a greate waie in Guian with his

power, whiche then was not fortified, neither of men of warre, nor municions,
nor artilarie.
               The Frenchemen of Bayon, hearyng of the Englishemennes campe,
made a greate askry betwene the riuer of sainct Maria and Bayon: the
Englishmen perceiuyng thesame, passed ye riuer in good ordre of battail,
all beyng on foote for lacke of the horsemen that the kyng of Arragon
promised, and so with arrowes chased the Frenchemen on horsebackes
that thei fled, and many horses foundered, and many a man was brosed
or thei came to Bayon: at the whiche thenglishmen laughed &amp; lamented.
Firste, to se their cowardnes, second, to remembre what thei might haue
doen, if thei had had horses mete for their purpose: yet all this notwithstandyng,
thei retired to their campe in suche ordre, that the Spanyardes
wondered muche, bothe at their fierce corage and sobre ordre.
               The kyng of Nauar, hearyng of the puissaunt armie of the Englishemen
liyng in Biskey so nere to his countrey, was sore troubled, &amp; wondered
muche what the matter should meane: wherfore, he sent to the lord
Marques, a bisshop and diuerse other, to shewe to hym and all his coū
                  saill,
that if it pleased them, his countrey should sende them victaill, and
all thynges necessarie for their money, and to do any other pleasure that
thei could do, whiche might be to the pleasure of hym and all his armie,
so y• his realme should be sure of any inuaciōs to be made by his people
               The Marques beyng capitain generall, with the aduise of the other
Lordes and counsaill, muche highly thanked the kyng of Nauer of his
good wil, aide, and comfort, which thynges onely thei required: and if it
pleased hym, that his people will and maie victaill vs, we shall not onely
paie theim for it, but also warraunt the passyng and repassyng for vs
and oures in sauetie, and that by vs no preiudice shalbee dooen to his
realme, 
                     •
                  or by our concent. With whiche answere the kyng of Nauer
was ioyous, and suffered his people to victaill, and resort to the hoosie,
with all thynges necessarie and belongyng to thesame, in greate windes
and stormes, for that tyme happened muche wind and raine, whiche sore
encombered the souldiours, that laye nightly on the bare grounde, for euery
man had not a tent or pauilion, whereof some were lame, and some
deffe, with other diseases.
               When the armie had lien there .xxx. daies, in the seconde campe there
came from the kyng of Arragon, a bisshop and other nobles of his coū
                  saill:
but whē it was knowen that it was thesame bisshop that made the
answere to the lorde Darcle at Caleis Males; as you haue hard the last
yere, then many saied, he came for no good but for delaies: but he required
the lord Marques to take pacience, for shortly suche prepare should
bee made, that he should see and proue, that it should bee to the honor of
his Master, And his greate renoume, to whom the Marques answered,
that vpon confidence of the kyng of Arragons promise that thei should
lacke no beastes mete for drawyng, and horsemen, the kyng of England
had sent hym and his compaignions thether, whereof we haue trusted

sithe our firste hether commyng, whiche thynges if wee had had, we had
dooen other enterprises then we haue doen: for now we haue lien here in
campe▪ to the greate charge of our Master the kyng of England, and to
no profite, and to our losse and greate hurt. For at our arriuall the coū
                  trey
of Guyan for the whiche we came, was vnprouided of men of warr,
municions, and ordinaunce, by reason whereof (if all thynges had been
accomplished of the part of your Master as we trusted) we might haue
had that whiche we came for, and if our commission had not been to folowe
the kyng your Masters will, as to whom we bee sent, I assure you
we would haue dooen other wise or this: but now the Frenchemen haue
fortefied, victailed, and manned their tounes, and wee haue spent tyme
and dooen nothyng al all, lyngeryng for the kyng your Master, to the
losse of vs and greate blemishyng of our honours.
               The bisshop perceiuyng that the Englishe capitaines were couragious
and discontent with their idle abode, flatteryngly desired theim to
tary a while for the best, for a backe enemie saied he, is to bee regarded.
Then saied the lorde Marqu
                     •
                  s capitain generall, if we knewe the Kynges
entent, it would suffice vs. Then saied the bisshop, you shall knowe
it shortly: and so he departed from the armie.
               Tharmie this lyngeryng, euer desirous to be at the busines that thei
came for, their victaile was muche part Garlike, and the Englishemen
did eate of the Garlike with all meates, and dranke hote wynes in the
hote wether, and did eate all the hote frutes that thei could gette, whiche
caused their bloudde so to boyle in their belies, that there fell sicke three
thousande of the flixe, and thereof died .xviii. hundred men.
               The lorde Marques and other capitaines perceiuyng this mischief,
sent to the kyng of Arragon certain Lordes of the hooste to knowe his
pleasure. The whiche answered them with gentle fashion, that the counsaill
of Englande and his counsaill, had taken an ordre in all thyng of
late and how the duke Dalua a greate prince of Spain, should shortly
with an armie royall ioyne with theim, and so to procede in their enterprise.
With whiche answere and small chere, the lordes of Englande departed,
and made report to their capitain accordyng, whiche thought it
verie sleight, but euer he regarded his Masters commaundement, and
counsailed all the lordes to be content with thesame.
               The armie liyng thus still, and the sickenes not slaked, the people beyng
idle, some euill disposed persones saied, that euery capitain was alowed
.viii.d. for a common souldier, whiche was vntrue, for thei had alowed
onely .vi.d, and so began together compaignies, the lordes perceiuyng
this, toke with theim their trustie seruauntes, and toke the beginners
of the mischief, whiche wer of the retinue of my lorde Willoughby,
and put them in warde. When thei wer arrested, other of like euil disposicion
began to crake and face, whiche thyng beyng perceiued, the lorde
Marques by the aduice of other capitaines caused serche to bee made,
and so founde out the beginner of the mischief, whiche was deliuered to

Willyam Kyngston Esquire then Prouost Marshall, and so was put
to death to the terror of all other.
               Duryng the tyme that the armie laie thus lyngeryng, the Frenchmen
diuerse tymes came to behold the Englishemen, and when thei sawe any
parte of the armie remoue toward theim, incontenent thei fled: and so the
Englishe archers euery daie went a forragyng on the borders of Guian
almoste to Bayon, and brent many pretie vilages, but euer thei desired
to haue tidynges of the kyng of Arragon, and to know what thei should
do, for thei wer commaunded to be ruled by them.
               The Englishemen thus liyng idlely abidyng the aide of the kyng of
Arragon, tidynges came daily into the host, how the Duke Dalua was
commyng with a great puissaunce to ioyne with the Englishe army, and
so to inuade Guyan: the Englishe capitaines were ioyfull of these tidynges,
not so muche for the aide of the Spanyardes whiche thei litle regarded,
but for the beastes for cariage of greate artilerie, whiche thei
brought not with theim, in hope of the kyng of Arragons promes: for if
thei had had beastes for their cariage, and greate ordinaunce accordyng
to the appoyntement, thei would haue doen otherwise, whiche thyng sore
greued their hartes.
               Now thei thus lokyng for the Duke Dalua, hard euery daie how he
marched towarde theim, and was within a daies iorney or litle more of
them, of the whiche the Englishe menne were merueilous ioyfull, but the
Duke whiche pretended another thyng, sodainly remoued his armie in
a night with suche diligēce that he entered the realme of Nauer, and was
before the citie of Pampilona the chief citie of Nauer before the kyng
wist of it, whiche nothyng suspected of that pollicie.
               Thus the kyng was sodainly trapped, supposyng tharmie of Spain
to haue been reised to inuade Guyan, and hauyng nothyng defensable
for the warre, in the night fled out at a posterne into Fraunce where he
after died. The citie of Pampilona and all the coūtrey of Nauer, beyng
vnprouided of artilarie and other defences, yelded thēselfes to the Spanyardes,
and thus was the realme of Nauer wonne, whiche thyng made
the lorde Marques and his compaignie not a litle to maruell. So shortely
after came to the lorde capitain and the Englishemen, diuerse Lordes
sent from the Kyng of Arragon, whiche saied: The kyng our soueraigne
lorde, sendeth to you greate gramercies, and highly thāketh you
for your pain, and so it is that by Goddes grace and your good abode,
he with his power hath taken and conquered the realme of Nauer, and
if that countrey had not bee taken, thei might haue intercepted all suche
ordinaunce and victail, as the kyng of Arragon our master might haue
sent to you, but now you bee in suche a suretie and his puyssaunce with
you, and youres with his, that ye maie sauely ioyne, whiche you shall see
shortly, ye and he hymself in proper person to ioyne with you. Well said
the lorde Marques capitain generall, we haue soieourned long here abidyng
his commyng, and if the commission and expresse commaundement

of the kyng my soueraigne lord wer not, that I should do nothyng
without the assent of the kyng your master, I assure you that the Frenchmenne
should haue knowen that Englishemen had been here, and not to
haue lien so long in idlenes as we haue dooen: but if the kyng your master
doo as you reporte, it shalbee muche to his honor and to our greate
comforte, and so the lordes of Spayne departed.
               As the armie of Englishemen thus laie in campe, there was a village
called Sancta Maria, in whiche diuerse of the Englishemen, and especially
suche as had been sicke, resorted and reposed theimself, not to the
litle auauntage of the toune, so it fortuned that a Spanyard gaue euill
language to the Englisheman, whiche gaue hym a buffet on the face, the
toune rose and sett on the Englisheman, and gathered in suche a multitude,
that the Englisheman whiche was the first beginner was slain, because
onely three Englishemen came to his rescue, whiche wer all hurte.
The Almaynes that laie at the tounes ende, strake Alarum whiche heatyng
the campe, cried to harnes euery man. The tidynges were brought
to the campe, that thei of the toune had slain an Englishman, and would
bid battaill: the souldiers hearyng this, in a rage ranne to the toune in
suche maner, that the capitaines could not stay them, and slewe and robbed
the people without mercy. The people fled ouer the water into Guyan.
The Capitaines seeyng this, with their priuie seruauntes kepte the
straightes, by the whiche the souldiers returned with village and naperie,
brasse, pewter, beddes, plate, and other houshold stuffe, and apparell:
which was commaunded to be laied doune by the lordes on a hepe. And
after the lordes went to the toune to se what harme the Englishmen had
doen, there thei found many Biskaynes slain, and the toune robbed, and
the people fled. Then thei by sobre meanes &amp; gentle exhortacion, brought
all the souldiers to the campe: then Proclamacion was made that euery
man vpon pain of death should bryng in his pillage. Now there wer .xxi
men, of whō one was a gentleman, whiche had taken awaie .x. thousande
Dukates, who fled toward Gascoyne and were taken, and brought before
the lorde capitain and other, and adiudged to dye: of the whiche .vii.
wer put in execucion, and the other .xiiii. should haue died the morow after,
if the lordes of Spayne had not been there at their iudgement which
with greate diligence and labor gat their pardon: and so all the pillage
almoste was restored, and the countrey pacified..
               Then one daie the Frenchemen whiche hard of this riot and trouble
in the hoste, issued out of Bayon toward the Englishe mennes armie, the
Englishmen hearyng therof, marched toward them, &amp; when the Frenchemen
perceiued that thei wer asskried, thei sodainly returned. Thenglishemenne
perceiuyng that the Frenchemen would not tary, went to a good
toune called sainct Ihon de Luce, and brent, robbed, and killed the inhabitauntes,
and so from thence spoyled diuerse other villages, aboute the
borders of Guyan. Thus the armie laie till the moneth of October, and
winter began sore to encrease, and the lorde Marques capitain generall

fell sore sicke, &amp; then the lorde Haward had vnder hym the whole gouernaunce
of tharmie, to whom wer sent diuerse lordes of the priuie coūsaill
of Spain saiyng: the king our master sendeth you worde, that he would
gladly come to you but the season is spent, the grounde is so moyste that
cariage cannot bee conueighed, the feldes so barrain that beastes cannot
fede, and the wether so trobleous that people cannot well lye abrode in
campe: therfore he would desire you all these thynges considred, to breke
vp your felde, and seuer your self to the tounes and villages of his coū
                  trey,
till the spryng of the yere, at whiche tyme there shall resorte to you,
freshe succors out of Englande, and he hymself will be with you with al
ordinaunce necessary, as becommeth to suche an armie, and then shall
procede the firste pretensed enterprise, to the honor of the kyng your master
and ours, and not to your small fame and renoume. When this message
was hard by the whole counsaill, no manne was contented, but the
lorde Haward whiche had the whole gouernaunce vnder the Marques
saied: what report of honour can we make of the kyng of Arragon your
master, for at his desire we be come hether, and here haue lien in campe a
long space, euer tariyng for performaunce of his promise, &amp; yet nothyng
hath he performed, our people be dedde of the flixe in greate nombre: wee
gentlemen euerychone doth muche lament this long idlenes, by reason
whereof many a tall man hauyng nothyng to do, but abidyng your masters
pleasure, hath fall to some mischief, or by sickenes, or els for misdoyng
executed by Iustice. What shall the kyng our master reporte of our
slothfulnes, whiche hath spent hym innumerable treasure and nothyng
gained? And yet we would make Winter warre, and the kyng of Arragon
your master vs denieth of suche thynges as he promised, and willeth
vs like cowardes to our dishonor, to reise our Campe without any
notable acte doen on the Frenchemen, for whiche cause we came.
               The Spanyardes perceiuyng the grudge of the Englishemen, saied
that tyme passed could not bee reuoked, and that thei had not lien idlely,
for the frontiers of Guyan had susteined suche damage, as in many yeres
thei shall not recouer again, and all this while the Frenchmen durst
not medle with you, so that you haue lost no honor, and if you tary here
this Winter by your daily in skirmishyng, thei shall receiue greate damage:
duryng whiche time, the kyng our master hath commaunded, that
thynges mete and necessarie for you to be at your commaundement, and
in the spryng of the yere, he shall ioyne with you, so that your enemies
and his shall well knowe your puissaunce, for he taketh all enemies to
you, to be his, so with faire wordes the counsaill of Spayne departed.
               Then the lorde Haward beyng chief, because the Marques was sicke
counsailed with all the other lordes and capitaines, and so in the ende of
October thei agreed to breake vp their Campe, and so thei did, and the
lorde Marques and his people went to sainct Sebastian, the lorde Haward
and his retinew to Rendre, &amp; the lorde Willoughby to Garschang
sir Willyam Sandes and many other capitaines to Fruntrabie, and so

euery capitain with his retinew wer seuered in diuerse villages.
               The English souldiers, what for sickenes, and what for miserie of the
countrey, euer desired to returne into Englande. The kyng of England
aduertised by the kyng of Arragon of his entent, and how he would set
forward the first spryng, sent Wynsore his Herauld of Armes to his armie
willyng them there to tary, and that he would sende them newe aide,
vnder the conduite of the lorde Harbert his Chamberlain: whiche letter
when it was redde, the souldiers began to murmure and grudge after
suche a sort, saiyng: that thei would not abide and dye of the flixe in such
a wretched countrey, to bee defrauded and mocked of the kyng of Arragon
the next yere, as thei wer this yere, and spake suche outragious wordes,
that the capitain could not staie them, in so muche that thei in a fury
had slain the lorde Haward &amp; diuerse other, if thei had not folowed their
myndes, and so thei hired shippes and putte the lorde Marques in one,
whiche was so weake that he asked where he was: and then euery manne
shipped, whiche was in Nouembre, and in the beginnyng of Decembre
thei landed in Englande. The kyng of Arrogon was sore discontent
with their departyng, for thei spent muche money and substaunce in his
countrey, and saied opēly, that if thei had taried he would haue inuaded
Guyan, and the Englishemen were glad that thei were departed out of
suche a countrey, where thei had litle health, lesse pleasure, and muche
losse of tyme: but by their liyng there, the Kyng of Arragon stale the
realme of Nauer, and the Englishemen left as muche money there, as he
sent into Englande with his daughter.
               When the Marques sailed into Spayne in the moneth of Maij, the
same tyme sir Edward Hawarde Lorde Admirall of Englande, as you
haue hard before sailed toward Britaine, and on Trinitie Sundaie arriued
at Bertram Bay in Britain, with .xx. greate shippes, and sodainly
set his men on lande: then the Britaynes made an askrie, and sette their
beacons on fire, and shot out of a bulwarke that thei had fortified at the
poynt of the Baye: but the Englishe men whiche wer in the ship of Willyam
Gonstone Grocer of Lōdon, toke first lande maugre them all, and
all other after, and so manfully thei set on the bulwarke that thei wan it,
and the Britons fled and many slain. Then the Admirall set his men in
an ordre, and passed in the countrey seuen myles, burnyng and wastyng
tounes and villages: and in his returne he skirmished with diuerse men
of armes and slewe diuerse of theim, and notwithstandyng the Britons
fought valiauntly for defence of their coūtrey, yet thei lost and nothyng
wan: and so the lorde Admirall returned to his shippe.
               Upon mondaie the .xxiii. daie of Maie he landed in the mornyng, and
commaunded to burne the lorde Piers Meguns place, and the toune of
Conket and diuerse other places, and chased the Britones to the Castle
of Brest, and for all assembles and showes that the Britons made, yet
thei fuffered the Englishmen peaceably to returne with their praies and
gaines. The Britons seyng the hurte that the nauie of Englande did to

theim, saied: alas the kyng of Englande hath euer before this tyme succomed
vs, and now he intendeth to destroye vs, shame come to hym that
is the cause thereof.
               The first daie of Iune the Englishemen toke lande in Croyton Bay:
then the Lordes of Britain sent worde to the Lorde Admirall, that if he
would abide, thei would fight with hym in plain felde. The Admirall rewarded
the messenger, and said, go saie to them that sent thee, that al this
daie thei shall finde me here, tariyng their commyng. Then he to encourage
diuerse gentlemen dubbed theim knightes, as sir Edwarde Broke,
brother to the lorde Cobham, sir Griffithe Doune, sir Thomas Wyndā,
sir Thomas Lucie, sir Willyam Pirton, sir Henry Shirborne, sir Stephen
Bull, sir Ihon Burdett: Then the lorde Admirall highly incouraged
his men, when he sawe the Britons come, whiche wer .x. thousande at
the least, the Englishemen but onely .xxv.C. or fewe aboue, biddyng thē
remembre the honor and renoume that should come to theim, if thei gained
the iorney, and yet if thei wer slain, their valiauntnes was to be praised,
&amp; their true diligence to do therr master seruice muche to be alowed.
               When the Britons sawe the order of the Englishemen and their banners
displaied, thei wer sodainly astonnied: then a gentleman of Britain
of muche experience, aduised the other capitaines not to fight, but to returne
a litle &amp; to take a strong grounde, and to watche the Englishemen,
when thei returned to their shippes, and then to take thaunauntage. And
so the capitaies began to returne: and when the commons sawe them returne,
all thei ranne a waie as faste as thei might, supposyng that their
capitaines had seen or knowen some greate perell toward them, because
thei were not priuy of their Capitaines counsaill. And when thei came
home to their houses, some saied the battaill was greate, and some saied
that the Englishemen wer .xl. thousande. The lorde Admirall seyng this
chaunce, when night came departed to his shippes: but yet thei knewe
not why thei fled, till after he hard the truthe. The gentlemen of Britain
called a greate counsaill, saiyng: that the Englishemen daily wasted the
countrey on the sea cost, and that there was no trust in the commonaltie,
and that the gentlemen alone could not defende the countrey, wherefore,
thei concluded to sende a messenger to the lorde Admirall, desiryng hym
of a safe conduite for diuerse persones to speake with hym, the whiche he
gently graunted. Then certain lordes of Britain toke a bote, and came
to the ship of the lorde Admirall, where he was set wth all the counsaill
of the capitaines about hym. Then thei desired hym humbly to 
                     •
                  urcest of
his rigorous and cruel warre, and especially of burnyng of tounes whiche
to you is nor proffite, and if you will haue the Castle of Brest, it shall
be at your commaundement, so that you be able to defende it, and we desire
nothyng so muche as peace. Naie saied the Lorde Admirall, wee are
sent hether to make warre and not peace. Then thei humbely required
hym for Goddes sake to graunt theim peace for sixe daies, so that thei
might sende to the kyng their lorde, to aduertise him of their trouble and

calamitie. Then the lorde Admirall answered, that gentlemen ought to
defende their coūtrey by force, rather then to sue for peace: with the whiche
saiyng the Britons wer ashamed: yet thei hartely thanked hym, and
so he made them a banker and thei departed: &amp; thei sent a lande for freshe
water and other freshe victailes, and then hearyng that there wer men of
warre vpon the sea, he coasted from them alongest al the coastes of Normandy,
still skowryng the seas, so that no enemie appered: and at the last
came and laie by the Isle of Wight, to see if any enemies would appere
on thenglishe coast: duryng whiche tyme diuerse shippes kept the North
seas, vnder the conduite of sir Edward Ichyngham, Ihon Lewes, Ihon
Louedaie, whiche diligently skowred the seas.
               This yere the Kyng had a solempne Iustes at Grenewiche in Iune:
first came in ladies all in White and Red silke, set vpon Coursers trapped
in thesame suite, freated ouer with gold, after whom folowed a fountain
curiously made of Russet Sattin, with eight Gargilles spoutyng
Water, within the Fountain sat a knight armed at all peces. After this
Fountain folowed a lady all in blacke silke dropped with fine siluer, on
a courser trapped in thesame. After folowed a knight in a horse litter, the
Coursers and litter apparcled blacke with Siluer droppes. When the
Fountain came to the tilt, the Ladies rode rounde aboute, and so did the
Fountain and the knight within the litter. And after theim wer brought
two goodly Coursers appareled for the Iustes: and when thei came to
the Tiltes ende, the twoo knightes mounted on the twoo Coursers abidyng
all commers. The kyng was in the fountain, and sir Charles Brā
                  don
was in the litter. Then sodainly with greate noyse of Trompettes,
entered sir Thomas Kneuet in a Castle of Cole blacke, and ouer the castell
was written, The dolorous Castle, and so he and the erle of Esex, the
lorde Haward and other rāne their courses, with the Kyng and sir Charles
Brandon, and euer the kyng brake moste speres.
               The Kyng euer remembryng his warres, caused all his shippes and
Galies to be rigged and prepared, with all maner of ordinaunce and artillery,
mete for shippes of warre. And emongest all other, he decked the
Regent, a ship royall, as chief ship of that nauie, and then caused souldiers
mete for thesame shippes, to muste
                     •
                   on blacke Hethe, and he appointed
capitaines for that tyme, sir Anthony Oughtred, sir Edward Ichyngham,
Willyam Sidney, and diuerse other gentlemen, whiche shortly
shipped and came before the Isle of Wight, but in their passage a Galey
was lost by negligence of the Master.
               The Kyng euer desiryng to see his nauie together, roade to Portesmouthe,
and there he appoynted capitaines for the Regent, sir Thomas
Kneuet Master of his horse, and sir Ihon Carew of Deuonshire. And to
another ship royal called the souereigne, he appoynted sir Charles Brā
                  don,
and sir Henry Guildforde, and with theim in the Souereigne were
put .lx. of the tallest yomen of the kynges Gard, and many other gentlemen
wer made Capitaines. The kyng made a greate banquet to all the

capitaines, and euery one sware to another euer to defend, aide, &amp; cōfort
one another without failyng, and this thei promised before the Kyng,
whiche committed theim to God, and so with greate noyse of minstrelsie
thei toke their shippes, whiche wer .xxv. in nombre of greate burden, and
well furnished of all thynges.
               The Frenche kyng hearyng what dammage thenglishmen had doen
in Britaine, strongly furnished his Nauie in the hauen of Brest, to the
nombre of .xxxix. saile, and for chief ordeined a Carike of Brest, apperteignyng
to the Quene his wife, whiche was Duches and heire of Britayne
called Cordelier, whiche was a strong ship furnished in all poyntes,
and so thei set forwarde out of Brest the .x. daie of August, and came
to Britayne Bay, in whiche place the self same daie, beyng the daie of. S.
Laurence, the Englishe Nauie was arriued.
               When the Englishe menne perceiued the Frenche Nauie to be out of
Brest hauen, then the lorde Admirall was very ioyous, then euery man
prepared accordyng to his duetie, the Archers to shote, the Gonners to
lose, the men of Armes to fight, the Pages went to the toppe Castle with
dartes: thus all thynges beyng prouided and set in ordre, the Englishemen
approched toward the Frenchemen, whiche came fiercely forwarde,
some leuyng his Ancre, some with his foresaile onely to take the moste
auauntage: and when thei wer in sight, thei shote ordinaunce so terrebly
together, that all the sea coast sounded of it. The Lorde Admirall made
with the greate ship of Depe, and chased her stil: sir Henry Guilford and
sir Charles Brandon, made with the greate Caricke of Brest, beeyng in
the Souereigne, and laied stemme to stemme to the Caricke, but by negligence
of the Master, or els by smoke of the ordinaunce or otherwise,
the Souereigne was cast at the sterne of the Caricke, with whiche auaū
                  tage
the Frenche menne showted for ioye: but when sir Thomas Kneuet
whiche was ready to haue borded the greate ship of Depe, sawe that the
Souereigne had missed the Caricke, whiche sir Anthony Oughtred chased
hard at the starne, and bowged her in diuerse places, and set a fire her
powder as some saie, but sodainly the Regent crappeled with her a long
boord and when thei of the Carick perceiued that thei could not depart,
thei let slip and Ancre, and so with the streme the shippes turned, and the
Caricke was on the wetherside, and the Regent on the lye side, the fighte
was very cruell, for the archers of the Englishe parte, and the Crossebowes
of the Freche part did their vttermost: but for all that the English
men entered the Caricke, whiche seyng a varlet Gonner beyng desperate
put fire in the Gonne powder as other saie, and set the whole ship of fire,
the flame wherof, set fire in the Regent, and so these twoo noble shippes
which wer so crappeled together that thei could not part, wer consumed
by fire. The French nauie perceiuyng this fled in all hast, some to Brest,
and some to the Isles adioynyng. The Englishmen in maner dismaied,
sent out boates to help them in the Regent, but the fire was so great that
in maner no man durst approche, sauyng that by the Iames of Hull wer

certein Frenchmen that could smymme saued. This burnyng of the Caricke
was happie for the Frenche nauie, or els thei had ben better assailed
of thenglishemen, whiche wer so amased with this chaunce, that thei
folowed them not. The capitain of this Carick was sir Piers Morgan
and with hym .ix.C. mē slain and ded: and with sir Thomas Kneuet and
sir Ihon Carow wer .vii.C. men drowned and brent, and that night all
the Englishemen laie in Bartrain Baye, for the Frenche flete was sparkeled
as you haue hard.
               The lorde Admirall called at the capitaines together, desiryng them
not to bee abasshed with this chaunce of warre, for he thought now that
this was the worste fortune that could happen to theim, therfore to studie
how to be reuenged, and so thei concluded all to go to the sea, whiche
thei did, and on the coast of Britain toke many shippes, and such as thei
could not cary awaie thei set on fire, small and greate to a greate nombre
on all the coast of Britain, Normandy and Picardy, and thus thei kept
the sea.
               The Kyng of Englande heryng of the losse of the Regent, caused a
greate shippe to be made, suche another as was neuer seen before in Englande,
and 
                     •
                  alled it, Henry grace de dieu.
               
               The French kyng heryng that his flete was thus deuided, and of the
losse of his greate Carick, he sent to a knight of the Rhodes called Prior
Ihon, whiche had three Galies of force, with diuerse Foystes &amp; Rowgalies
so well ordinaūced and with suche peces as was not seen in shippes
before his commyng: for he laye on the coast of Barbary, to defende
certein of the Religion of the Rhodes commyng to Tripoly, and at the
Frenche kynges request came into Britain and there taried.
               In Nouembre the kyng called his high Courte of Parliament, and
there was concluded that the kyng hymself in person, with an armie royall
would inuade his realme of Fraunce, with fire and Sworde, whiche
thyng beeyng knowen to his subiectes, and especiall to suche as should
go with hym, no man can doubt, but that preparacion was made of harneis,
weapon, artillery, banners and all other thynges necessarie for such
an enterprice.
               The kyng after this Parliament ended, kept a solempne Christemas
at Grenewiche to chere his nobles, and on the twelfe daie at night came
into the hall a Mount, called the riche Mount. The Mount was set ful
of riche flowers of silke, and especially full of Brome slippes full of coddes,
the braunches wer grene Sattin, and the flowers flat Gold of Damaske,
whiche signified Plantagent. On the top stode a goodly Bekon
geuyng light, rounde about the Bekon sat the kyng and 
                     •
                  iue other, al in
coates and cappes of right Crimosin veluet, enbroudered with flat gold
of Dāmaske, their coates set full of spangelles of gold, and foure woodhouses
drewe the Mount till it came before the quene, and then the kyng
and his compaignie discended and daunced: then sodainly the Mount
opened, and out came sixe ladies all in Crimosin satin and plunket, enbroudered

with Golde and perle, with Frenche hoddes on their heddes,
and thei daunced alone. Then the lordes of the Mount tooke the ladies
and daunced together: and the Ladies reentred, and the Mount closed,
and so was conueighed out of the hall. Then the Kyng shifted hym and
came to the Quene, and sat at the banqute whiche was very sumpteous.
And after the Purificacion of our Lady, the Kyng created sir Charles
Brandon Uiscount Lisle. In Marche folowyng, was the kynges nauie
of shippes royall, and other mete for the warre set furth to the nombre of
xlii, beside other Blangars, the lorde Admirall was chief, and with hym
sir Water Deueruex lorde Ferr
                     •
                  is, sir Wolstan Browne, sir Edwarde
Ichyngham, sir Antony Poyntz, sir Ihon Wallop, sir Thomas Wyndam,
sir Stephin Bull, Willyam Fitz Willyam, Arthur Plantagenet,
Willyam Sidney Esquires, and diuerse other noble and valiaunt Capitaines:
thei sailed to Portesmouthe, and there laie abidyng Wynde:
duryng whiche tyme, the kyng sent into Flaunders for suche thynges as
he neded, and caused them to be brought to Caleis against his cōmyng.
               When the wynde serued, the Nauie royall of Englande wayed anker
and made saile into Britain, and came into Bertram Bay, and there lay
at Anker in the sight of the Frenche Nauie. Now you must vnderstand,
that all the great Nauie whiche the Frenche kyng had prepared, laie in
the hauen of Brest, so well furnished in al thynges, that no doubt it was
a wonder to se: but when thei wer ready to sette furthe, and sawe the Englishe
flete on the coast, thei determined clerely to saue thēselfes in Brest
hauen. Then the Englishemen determined clerely to sette on them in the
hauen, and so in good ordre of battaill sailed forward, but at the first entry,
one ship, wherof Arthur Plantagenet was capitai
                     •
                  , fell on a blynde
rocke &amp; brast asunder, by reason wherof, all the other staied to the greate
displeasure of all the remnaunt, and not to the litle ioye of the Frenchmē
whiche shot at them without dooyng any harme. So the Englishe capitai
                     •
                  es
perceiuyng that the hauen was daungerous to entre without an
expert lodesman, cast aboute and returned to their harborough at Bertram
Baye again.
               The Frenchmen perceiuyng that the Englishmen intended to assaile
theim, moored their shippes as nye to the Castle of Brest as thei could,
and set bulwarkes on the land on euery side to shote at the Englishmen.
Also thei frapped together .xxiiii. greate Hulkes, that came to the Baye
for salt, and set theim on a rowe, to the intent that if the Englishe menne
would haue assaulted theim, thei would haue set theim on a fire, and let
theim driue with the streme emongest the Englishe Nauie. Prior Ihon
also laie still in Blacke Sable or Whitesande Baye, and plucked his
Galies to the shore, and sette his Basiliskes and other ordinaunce in the
mouthe of the Baye, whiche Baye was bulwarked on euery side, that by
water it was not possible to be wonne.
               The lorde Admirall perceiuyng the Nauie of Fraunce to lye this in
feare, and not willyng nor daryng come abrode, but to lye as prisoners

in a dongeon, wrote to the Kyng to come thether in persone, and to haue
the honor of so high an entreprise: whiche writyng the Kynges counsaill
nothyng allowed, for puttyng the kyng in ieoperdy vpon the chaunce of
the sea. Wherefore the kyng wrote sharply to hym, to accomplishe that
whiche apperteined to his duetie: whiche caused hym to take courage
and put thynges in aduenture as after you shall here.
            
            
               ¶The .v. yere.The .v. yere.
               
               
                  AS you haue hard before, the lorde Admirall of England
laie still on the coast of Britain in the Baye, called Bartrames
Baye, so that for feare of hym and the Englishe
Nauie, neither the greate shippes in Brest hauen durste
once moue to the sea ward, nor yet Prior Ihon for al his
strong Galeies would once sette out a saile: sauyng now
and then sende furthe his small Foystes, to make a shewe before the Englishe
Nauy, whiche chased them to their bay, but because the Englishe
shippes were so greate thei could not entre the baye, and so manned out
boates and toke one of the best Foystes, and that with greate daungier,
for the Galies and the bulwarkes shot all at one time, that it was a wō
                  der
how the Englishemen escaped.
               The Admirall of Englande perceiuyng the Frenche mennes pollicy,
called a counsaill, and there determined firste to assaile Prior Ihon and
his Galies, liyng in Whitsand baye, and after to set on the remnaunt in
the hauē of Brest. Then first was appoynted that Water lorde Ferreis,
sir Stephin Bul and other capitaines, should go a lande with a conuenient
compaignie, to assault the bulwarkes of Whitsand bay, while the
Lorde Admirall entered with rowe Barges and litle Galies into the
bay, so that the Frenchmen should be assailed bothe by water and land.
Thus was it fully agreed by the whole counsaill: but alas, this noble
capitain counsailed by a Spanishe knight called sir Alphous Charant,
whiche saied that he might entre the Baye wit
                     •
                   litle ieopardy, called to
hym Wilyam Fitz Willyam, Willyam Cooke, Ihon Colley, and sir
Wolstan Browne as the chief and his moste trustie frendes, and declared
to theim that the matter was litle, and the honor greate, if thei onely
tooke on theim that enterprise, and let none other knowe of it. Thei like
men of haute courage and desiryng honour, gladly assented: so on sainct
Markes daie the .xxv. daie of Aprill, thesaid Admirall put hymself in a
small rowe barge, with three other small rowyng shippes and his awne
ship boate, and so rowed sodainly into the Baye, where Prior Ihon had
moored his Galies iust to the ground, whiche Galies with the bulwarkes
on the lande, shot so terribly that thei that folowed wer a fraied: but
assone as he came to the Galies, he entered and draue out the Frenche
men. Willyam Fitiz Willyam within his shippe was sore hurte with a
quarell. The day was very shalowe, and the other shippes could not entre,
for the tide was spent, whiche thyng the Frenchmen perceiuyng, and

that there could come no succoure to the Admirall, with Morris pikes
entered again the Galies, and fought with the Englishemen in the Galies.
And the Admirall perceiuyng their approchyng, thought to haue
entered again into his rowe Barge, whiche by violence of the tide was
driuen doune the streme, and so with a pike was throwen ouer the borde
and so drouned, and there the forenamed Alphous was slain, and all the
other boates and vesselles scaped hardely, for if thei had taried, the tide
had failed them and then all had been lost. The lorde Ferreis and other
capitaines muche were dolent of this chaunce, and some saied he did it
without counsaill, and so he hath sped. And therefore although that thei
would haue sette on the Nauie in Brest hauen, yet hauyng no Admirall
nor commission, thei determined to do nothyng farther till thei knew the
kynges pleasure, and so sailed into Englande. The Frenche Nauie perceiuyng
that the Englishemen made toward England, came out of their
hauens, and Prior Ihon set furthe his Galies and Foystes, and coasted
Britain and Normandy, and coasted ouer to the coast of Sussex and al
his compaignie, and landed on the sea coast, and set fire on the poore cotages.
The gentlemen that dwelte nere, shortely reised the countrey, and
came to the coast and droue Prior Ihon to his Galeis. This was al the
hurt that this stout capitain of so great fame did to England, sauyng he
robbed certein poore. Fisshermen of Whitynges. The kyng hearyng of
the death of his Admirall was not a litle sory, consideryng bothe nobilitie
of his birthe, and the valiauntnes of his persone, but all sorowe auaileth
not whē the chaunce is past. Therfore the kyng heryng that the
Frenche Nauie was abrode, called to hym the lorde Thomas Haward,
elder brother to sir Edward Haward late Admirall, and sonne and heire
apparant to the Erle of Surrey, and made hym Admirall, willyng him
to reuēge his brothers death, whiche with greate reuerence, thanked the
kyng of the high truste that he had put hym. And then immediatly went
to the sea, and so nobly &amp; valiauntly did skower the sea, that the French
men had no lust to kepe the coast of Englande, for he fought with theim
at their awne portes.
               The kyng whiche had all thynges necessary and mete for the warre,
entendyng to passe the sea in propre person, appoynted the valiaūt lorde
George Talbot Erle of Shrewesbury, and high Steward of his houshold
to be capitain generall of his forward, and in his compaignie wer
lorde Thomas Stanley Erle of Derby, lorde Decowrey Prior of. S.
Ihons, sir Rober Radcliffe Lorde Fitzwater, the Lorde Hastynges, the
Lorde Cobham, sir Rice Ap Thomas, sir Thomas Blount, sir Richard
Sachiuerell sir Ihon Dighby, sir Ihon Askewe, sir Lewes Bagot, sir
Thomas Cornewall, and many Knightes and Esquiers and souldiers,
to the nombre of .viii.M. menne, whiche all passed the sea, and to Caleis
in the middle of Maij.
               The lorde Herbert called sir Charles Somerset, chief Chamberlain
to the kyng: the ende of thesame monethe with .vi.M. men passed the sea

in whose compaignie were these Erles, of Northumberlande Percie, of
Kent Graye, of Wilshire Stafford, the lorde Fitzwater, the lorde Dudley,
the lorde Delawar, sir Thomas West his sonne, sir Edward Husey,
sir Robert Dimmocke, sir Dauie Owen, with many other gentlemenne,
some with speres on horsebacke, some with pikes on foote, some with dimilaunces,
and this was the rereward. Such good diligēce was made
that these twoo capitaines with all their compaignie, furnished with artilerie,
pouder, tentes, cariages, and all thynges necessary for the warres
wer landed at Caleis the last daie of Maij.
               After thei had soiourned certain daies in Caleis, and that al thynges
requisite wer ready, thei caused a Trompet to blowe and made Proclamacion,
that euery man should departe out of the toune, and so to begyn
the campe. The erle of Shrewesbury with his compaignie first toke the
felde, after hym folowed the lorde Herbert with his compaignie, in maner
of a rereward. And after hym folowed the valiaunt sir Rice ap Thomas,
with .v.C. light horse and Archers on horsebacke, and ioyned hym
to the foreward. Then was there ordre taken what persones should conduite
the victalers that came from Caleis, and who should conduite the
victalers that came out of Flaunders, for without sufficient conduite no
creature durste bryng any victaile to the armie. These twoo lordes thus
embattailed remoued the .xvii. daie of Iune to Sandisfelde, and on the
xviii. daie thei came to Margison, on y• farre side of the water, as though
thei would haue passed streightly to Bulleyn, but thei thought otherwise,
for the nexte daie thei tooke another waie, and coasted the countrey
with suche diligence, that the .xxii. daie of Iune thei with all their people
ordinaunce, and habilimentes of warre, wer come before the strong citie
of Tirwin, and pight their Tentes a myle from the toune, and for that
night embattailed themself: and as certain capitaines wer in counsail, in
the lorde Herbertes tent, sodainly out of the toune was shot a gonne, the
pellet wherof slewe a noble capitain called the Baron of Carew, sittyng
there in counsaill, whiche sodain aduenture dismaied muche the assemble.
But the lorde Herbert valiauntly cōforted theim, saiyng: this is the
chaunce of warre, if it had hit me you muste haue been content, a noble
harte in warre is neuer a feard of death. All the countrey of Arthois and
Picardie, fortified their holdes, and made shewes as the Englishe army
passed, but thei durst not once assaile them.
               The citie of Tirwin was strongly fortifed with wales, rampaires,
bulwarkes, with diuese fortresses in the diches, whiche wer so brode and
so plume stepe y• was wondre to behold. The lorde Pountremy was capitain
generall, and with hym wer within the citie .vi.C. horsmen furnished,
and twoo .M.v.C. Almaines beside the inhabitauntes of the citie,
the walles &amp; towers wer ful of ordinaunce, whiche did oftentymes great
displeasure to the Englishemen. The Erle of Shrewesbury laied siege
to the toune, on the North West side, and the lorde Herbert on the Easte
side or ende ward, the Frenchmen issued out of the toune and skirmished

with the Englishmenne, but the Archers shot so fast that thei draue the
Frenchemen into the citie, and slewe and toke diuerse of them. The lorde
Herbert which laie in the open sight of the toune, hauyng no hill or other
thyng to succour or defende hym, caused greate trenches to be made, and
so inawger his enemies he approched very nere the cite: likewise therle of
Shrewesbury with the forward, gatte into an holowe ground or valey
nere to the citie. Daily the Frenchmen shot at thenglishmen, and diuerse
tymes issued out and skirmished, and euer thei lost by skirmishyng, but
by shotyng of ordinaunce thei hurte diuerse Englishmen. Wherfore the
lordes commaunded the pioners to raise a greate trenche, in whiche thei
laied the greate ordinaunce, and daily as thei might thei approched: sir
Rise ap Thomas with the horsemen daily skowered the countrey, &amp; many
tymes encountered with the Frenchemen, and slewe and toke diuerse
prisoners, so that the Frenchmen drewe not toward the siege, but turned
another waie. Upon the Mundaie beeyng the .xxvii. daie of Iune .xxiiii.
Cartes charged with victaill, wer by the Garrison of Caleis conduited
to Guisnes, and there the Crewe of the castle and toune of Guisnes with
three .C. foote men, vnder the conduite of sir Edward Belknappe, all beyng
in nombre .iiii.C.lx. men, set furthe to conduite thesaied victailes to
tharmie liyng before Tirwyn, and so thei passed to Arde. And while the
Carters passed the toune, the horsemen fell a drinkyng in the waie, and
the foote men wer all out of 
                     〈◊〉
                  . The duke of Uandosme capitain generall
of Picardie, whiche la
                     ••
                   in a bushement in the forest side of Guysnes
with .viii.C. light horsemen, toke his aduauntage and set on the victailers,
the Carters perceiuyng that, losed their horses and fledd to the
toune, whiche was but a myle of and left their Cartes. Sir Nicholas
Uaux capitain of Guysnes did al he could, to bryng the foote men in an
ordre: but the Frenchemen set on so quickly that thei could not set theim
in ordre, the horsemen of Guysnes whiche wer but onely .xxiiii. toke their
speres and ioyned with the Frenchemen: the Archers of Englande whiche
passed not .lx. shot manfully, and a noble capitain called Baltier Delien
and diuerse other, but the Frenchemen were so many in nombre and
in good ordre that thei flew viii. gentlemen of the Garrison of Guysnes,
and .xxx. Archers slain and many hurte, and so thei distrussed the victailes,
and caused sir Nicholas Uaux, and sir Edwarde Belknappe to flie
toward Guisnes. This misauenture fell by tariyng of the horsemen and
breakyng of array, for if tharchers had taried together it had happened
otherwise, for the fewe Archers that held together, flewe and hurt diuerse
Frenchemen: For on the felde laie .lxxxvii. greate horse whiche neuer wēt
thence, by the whiche it appered that the Frenchemenne went not quite awaie
without losse. When tidynges of this misauenture came to the lordes
at the siege, thei were not a litle displeased: and sir Rise ap Thomas
caused his Trompet to blowe to the stirroppe, and he with his horsemen
sought the Duke of Uandosme all the countrey, whiche hearyng of the
commyng of sir Rise, with greate hast retreted backe to Bangey Abbey,

where the Frenche kynges greate army laie. Sir Rise heryng y• he was
returned came the next daye agayn to y• sege. The rumour of this skyrmish
sprong all the English pale toward Flaunders, wherfore the tounes
fiered ther bekons &amp; rang alarme, diuers honorable men ye had passed
the see wt cōpanies of souldiours &amp; were in Caleis, marched forward
in order of battaile, but heryng of y• departīg of Moūsire de vādosme, thei
rested. Then was new prouisiō made for vitaile &amp; sent daily frō Caleys
to Turwyn by such conduite, y• the Frenchmen would no more meddill,
and the army also was well vitaled out of Flaunders and Henawde.
               The army of England thus lay before the strong toune of Turwin: y•
noble kyng of Englād not forgettyng his entreprice prepared al thyng
redy to passe the see in proper persone, and caused sir Ihon Wilshire to
puruey for .iii.C. hoyes to carry ouer his artillery &amp; habilimēts of warre
and al his shippes of warre were on the see skowering euery coste of his
realme. And when al thinges were prest, he accompanied with many noble
men and .vi.C. archers of his garde, al in white gabberdines &amp; cappes,
departed from his manour royal of grenewich the .xv. day of Iune
and so he and the quene with smal iorneys came to Douer castell &amp; there
rested, and made the quene gouerner of the realme, &amp; commaūded William
Warram then bishop of Cantorbury and sir Thomas Louell a
sage knyght and diuers other, to gyue there attendaunce on the quene.
And commaunded therle of Surrey to drawe toward the north partes
left the Scottes woulde make any entreprice in his absence. Then the
king toke leue of the quene and of the ladies which made such sorow for
the departyng of their lords and husbandes, that it was greate dolor to
beholde, and so he with all his army toke his shippe the last day of Iune
beyng the daye of sainct Paule.
               In the mornyng when the kyng was shipped and made saile, al ye army
folowed, to the nomber of .iiii.C. shippes, and the winde was so, that
they were brought euen on the coste of picardy open vpon sainct Ihons
Roade, &amp; with the flud they haled a lōg the coste of Whitsand wt trūpettes
blowyng and gonnes shotyng, to the great feare of them of Bolleyn
which plainly might beholde this passage, and so came to Caleys hauē.
               The kyng was receiued into a bote couered with arras, &amp; so was set
on londe. He was appareilled in almayne ryuet crested &amp; his vābrace of
thesame, &amp; on his hedde a chapeau mōtabyn with a riche coronal, y• folde
of the chapeau was lined with crimsyn satē, &amp; on y• a riche brooch with y•
image of sainct George, ouer his riuett he had a garment of white cloth
of gold with a redde crosse, &amp; so he was receiued with procession &amp; wt hys
deputie of Caleys called sir Gylbert Talbott, and all other nobles and
gentlemen of the towne &amp; countrey, &amp; so entred in at the lanternegate &amp;
passed the stretes tyll he came to Saincte Nycholas churche, &amp; ther he
alighted &amp; offered, &amp; frō thens he went to y• stapleinne where he supped.
               When the kyng entred Caleys, al the banished men entred wt hym &amp;
were restored to y• liberty of y• toune. To tell of y• gonne shott of y• toune

and of the shippes at the kynges landing it was a great wonder, for m
                     •
                  
of good estimaciō reported that thei harde it at Douer. The king lyeng
thus in Caleys, all his army except a few of his counsail and other that
gaue their attendaunce on hym laye encamped at Newnam bridge, in
which campe about a .xi. of the clock at night there rose an eskrye, so that
the towne of Caleys began alarme, with that the kyng waked and came
to the walles, and demaunded what the matter ment, the yoman of the tē
                  tes,
called Richarde Gybson, shewed him howe that certayne horsmen &amp;
footmē of Fraūce, profered to come ouer the hauē, &amp; the archers that laie
next the see side entred into the water &amp; defended y• passage, wt
which defence
the Frenchmē returned, &amp; so y• kyng was satisfied. But after this a
Frēchmā of Whitsād bay &amp; one of Bullain were takē, y• one called Charles
de bone, the other Peter vernowne, which confessed y• frō the toune of
Whitsand came .lx. horsmen &amp; .ii.C. footmen of the garrison of Bulle
                     ••
                  
&amp; the countrey adioynyng entendyng to passe by Rice banke at the low
water marke, ouer yt hauē of Caleis at a certayn foord shewed to thē by
a spy which serued the yomā of y• tētes of vitailes, &amp; shewed thē that the
tentes were piched vnder Caleis walles betwene the towne &amp; the cāpe, so
that thei might burne thē quykly or the towne could issue, or the cāpe remoue.
But the Englishmen kept so good watch as you haue harde that
their entreprice came to none effect. The morow after being the first day
of Iuly, y• noble lord Haward admirall of Englād landed at Whitsand
Bay, &amp; entred, spoyled &amp; brent the toune, &amp; returned to his ships for all y•
Bullonoys, &amp; so recōpensed the imaginaciō that the bayly of Whitsand
&amp; the Bullonoys had entreprised for the burnyng of the kynges tentes.
               On fryday at night blew suche a storme yt seuered all the nauy, &amp; some
were drowned. Upon the .viii. day of Iuly, the lord Marques Dorsett,
therle of Essex, the lord Lisle rode into Flaūders &amp; ther toke y• mousters
of the lord Lynny, the lord Walō, sonne to the lord of Barow, &amp; bastard
Emery which wt ther retinue were then admitted into the kyngs wages
&amp; the lord Linny Wt a.C. &amp; .l. speres was appoincted to go to y• lord Herbert:
&amp; the lord Walon &amp; bastard Emery wt ther bondes were appointed
to go to therle of Shrewsbury liēg before Tirwin: These strāgers were
warlycke persons on light horses. While the siege laye thus before
Tyrwyn as you haue harde, the Frenchmen diuerse times issued out on
horseback and many a staffe was broken &amp; many a proper feat of armes
done. Likewise the Almaynes on foot would diuerse times issue out wt
handgonnes, and morish pycks &amp; assaile the Englishmē, but by force of
the archers thei were euer driuen home agayn, &amp; euery day the Englishmen
shott at the towne and dyd them muche displeasure.
               The .xxi. day of Iuly (when all thinges by counsaill had byn ordered
concernyng the order of battayle) the kyng passed out of y• towne of Caleis
in goodly array of battaile &amp; toke the felde: And notwithstādyng ye
the forward &amp; the rerewarde of the kynges great army were before Tirwyn
as you haue harde: Yet the kyng of his awne battayle made .iii.

battailles after the fasshion of the warre, the lord Lisle marshall of the
hoste was capitaine of the forward, and vnder him .iii.M. men. Sir Richard
Carew wt .iii.C men was the right hand wyng to the forward, &amp; y•
lord Darcy wt .iii.C. mē, wyng on y• left hand, yt skoure

of this battaile were y• North
                     •
                  berland men on light geldynges. Therle
of Essex was Lieutenant general of the speres, and sir Ihon P
                     ••
                  hy was
vicegouernour of the horsmen: before y• kyng went .viii.C. Almaynes al
in a plūpe by them selfs: after thē came the standard wt the redde Dragō,
next the banner of our lady, &amp; next after the banner of ye trinitie, vnder y•
same were all the kyngs houshold seruaūtes, then went y• bā
                  
                     •
                  er of y• armes
of Englād borne by sir Henry Guildford, vnder which bāner was
the kyng him self, wt diuers noble men &amp; other to the nōber of .iii.M. mē.
The duke of Buckynghā with .vi.C. mē was on y• kyngs left hād egall
wt ye Almaynes, in likewise on ye right hād was sir Edward Pounynges
wt other .vi.C. men egall with the Almaynes. The lord of Burgainie wt
viii.C. men, was wyng on y• right hand, sir Williā Cōpton wt ye retinue
of ye bishop of Wīchester, &amp; master Wolsey y• kings Almoner to ye nōber
of .viii.C. was in maner of a rereward, sir Anthony oughtred &amp; sir Ihon
Neuell wt the kings speres y• folowed, were .iiii.C. &amp; so y• hole army were
xi.M. &amp; .iii.C. men. The master of the ordinaunce sett foorth the kinges

                  ynges, bōbardes, cartes with powder, stones, bowes,
arowes &amp; such other thinges necessary for the felde, the hole nomber
of the cariages were .xiii.C. the leders and driuers of the same were .xix.
C. men and all these were rekened in the battaile, but of good fightynge
men ther were not full .ix.M.
               Thus in order of battaile y• kyng rode to Seutrey
                     •
                  a &amp; ther lodged y•
first night, on friday y• garrisō of Bulleyn mustered nye to Fines Mill, &amp;
were askryed by y• Northūberland mē, which marched toward thē, but y•
Frenchmen returned. On saterdaie the hoste remoued to Hambwell and
ther rested. On sonday, &amp; on mondaie he entered into the French groūde
nye to Arde, &amp; ther euery gentlemā had on his coate of armes, &amp; these tydyngs
were brought to ye kyng y• ye Frēch army approched, which ridinges
pleased him well, for he desyred nothyng but battaile. Tewsday the
xxvi. day of Iuly the kyng passed forward in order of battayle &amp; euer y•
Frenchmen costed a farre of to take the Englyshmen at some auantage,
but thei kept them so close in order, y• they could not fynd them out of array.
Howbeit, by negligence of the carters yt mystooke y• waye a greate
Curtall called the Ihon euangelist, was ouerthrowen in a depe ponde
of water, and coulde not quickly be recouered.
               The kyng heryng y• his enemies approched, leuyng the gonne (because
the master carpenter sayde y• he woulde shortely way it out of the water)
set forwarde his hoste, and in good order came to Dornahan where
is a fayre eastell standyng in a wodde countrey, the Frenchmē were euer
lurkyng in the woddes viewing the kynge cōduite &amp; order as he passed,
and so he lefte the towne of Dornahan on his right hande, and came

to a village on a litle riuer where y• ordinaūce pitched. And when y• king
came to the ryuer he perceyued y• many gentlemen made daūger to entre
into the riuer:The courage of the kyng. Wherfore he a lighted downe of his horse and without
any more abode entred the riuer, then all other entred and came ouer.
Then was tydynges brought to hym, that the Frenchmen were nere at
hande and would fight that nyght: the kyng still abode in order of battaile,
euer lokynge for the commynge of the Frenchmen, and at night
woorde was brought that they were reculed, and then he entred into his
tente.
               Wednesday the .xxvi. daye of Iuly the releffe of the speres brought
in askry, wherfore the kyng commaunded to blow to the standarde, and
auaunced his banner &amp; toke a faire feld or banke abidyng the comming
of the Frenchmen. The capitaines generall of the army of the French
kyng were the lord dela Palice and the lord of Piens, accompaignyed
with the duke of Longuyle, therle of sainct Polle, the lord of Floringes,
the lord Cleremounde, &amp; Richard dela Pole traytour of England sonne
to y• duke Ihon of Suffolke: with these capitaines were cōmyng .xi.M.
footmen and .iiii.M. horsmen, all prest in battayle &amp; came wt in .ii. miles
of the kyng of Englande, and there the footmen staled and came no farther:
certaine horsmen to the nomber of .iii.M. and aboue marched forward
and at the ende of a wodde shewed them selfes open in the sight of
the English army. The kyng perceiuyng there demeanure, commaūded
al his footmen not to remoue, but to stand still. The Frenchmē remoued
and came sumwhat nerer to a place of execucion: then the master Gōner
lo
                     •
                  ed a pece of artilery or two. As the kynge lay thus still abydynge his
enemies, and that the horsemen stode still in sight, the greate armye of
Fraunce approched, whiche the Englishmen could not descrye by cause
of an hyll that was betwexte them. The Northerne men ran to y• Frēchmen,
which manly encontered with them and strake some of them downe
and maugre all there powre brought certaine prisoners to the kyng of
England. Therle of Essex capitaine of the kynges speres with .ii.C. speres
lay in a stale, if the Frenchmen had come nerer. Then sodainly apered
in sight a great comopany of horsmen and the kynge knewe not what
thei were: but at ye last it was perceyued that it was the valiant knyght
sir Rice app Thomas with his retinue whiche came to the kyng aboute
none: which gentilly receyued hym and sent hym to therle of Essex, which
incontinentely departed and compassed the hill and came to therle, and
when they were ioyned, they drewe them about the hyll accompaignyed
with sir Thomas Gylforde capitayne of .ii.C. archers on horsbacke, to
thentent to haue set on the Frenchmē, which perceiuyng yt, &amp; dowghtyng
more nomber to come after, sodainly drewe back &amp; ioyned them wt there
great battaile. Then therle of Essex &amp; thenglish horsmen folowed them
tyll they came nere the greate army of Fraunce and then staled, and sent
light horsemen to knowe y• conduite of y• French army. When y• Frenchmen
of armes were retorned to ther battaile, both y• footmen &amp; horsemen

reculed in order of battell and went back a pace, the Englyshe styrrers
perceyuyng this, folowed .iii. leages and returned to therle, makyng reporte
of that they had sene, and then he brake vp his stale and came to y•
kyng, declaryng to him how y• Frenshmen were reculed.The dry Wednesday. This daie was
called the drye wednesday, for the day was wonderfull hoat and y• kyng
and his army were in order of battaile from .vi. of y• clock in y• mornyng
tyll .iii. of the clock at after noone, and some died for lack of moysture &amp;
allmost in generall euery man was burned about the mouth with hete
of the stomack, for drynke lacked and water was not nere. After this, y•
kyng remoued towarde Tyrwyn hauyng his horsmen behynde him, lest
the Frenshmen should sodainly sett on hym behynde, &amp; as the kyng was
settyng forward, the lord Walowne of Flaunders came to the kyng wt
his horsmen which were in the kynges wages, and the kyng declared to
him what had chaunced. As the army passed by negligence thesame day
in a lane, was ouerthrowen one of the kynges great bōbardes of Iron,
called the redde gonne, and there left: When the night began to approche
the kyng rested and toke his campe .ii. myles from sainct Omers on
the northsyde.
               On the thursdaye beyng the .xxviii. daie of Iuly the master carpēter
with an hundred carpenters and labores without knowlege of y• marshall
went to waye vp y• great gonne that was in the ponde as you haue
harde, &amp; by force of engynes drewe it vp and laied it on a carte redy to
cary: But sodainly out of a wodde issued .viii.C. Frenchmen with speres,
crosbowes and handgōnes, and assayled the poore labourers which
valiantly defended them selfes: but oppressed with multitude, the most
parte was flayne and the remnant taken, and they &amp; y• pece of ordinaūce
caried to bulleyne. This misauenture fel, for the master carpēter would
woorke all of his awne hedde without counsayll, with which chaunce y•
kyng was sore displeased. The Frenchmē ioyous of this chaunce, assembled
a great nomber, to take the other gonne y• lay still in the high way.
Wherfore the lord barnes beyng capiteyne of the pioners and laborers
heryng of y• misauenture, and consideryng that y• other gonne was lyēg
behynd▪ prepared al maner of engines to recouer thesame. The morowe
after, the kyng entended to reyse his camp, but when he harde of ye great
pece of ordinaunce that was left behynde, and that the Frēshmen assembled
together, he was in a greate musyng and so taryed and commaunded
the Almaynes to retreate back and to succour them that went for y•
pece of ordinaunce. The Almaynes went foorth and staled within two
mile, where the pece of ordinaunce lay, and farther thei woulde not goo.
The earle of Essex with his company of speres, sir Rice ap Thomas, wt
his compaignie, sir Ihon Neuell with the Northūberland men sett forward
to helpe the lord Barnes for recouery of the gonne. And sodainly
the northren horsmen espied where al the great army of the Frenshemen
were commyng forward, and so reported to therle of Essex, y• to sir Ihon
pechy Lieutenant of the horsemen and speres &amp; other capitaines, which

were in the place where the said goune was left with a hundred horsmē,
which heryng therof sent woorde to sir Rice, which hering therof desired
the erle of Essex to come &amp; to take grounde in that place where he was,
which remoued in greate haste: In the meane season by y• diligent labor
of ye lord Barnes, y• pece of ordinaunce was raysed &amp; carted, and furthe
was it caried, by this time the French army apered in sight.
               When therle of Essex saw the great nomber of the Frenchmen, in all
hast he sent to the lord Walon, willyng hym wt his company to come to
there ayde, the lord Waloun sayde to y• messenger, go tel your capitayne
y• I come hither to serue the kyng of England more then one daye, and
therfore I would all thenglishmen would returne, for wt ye great power
of Fraunce thei be not able to fight, for I esteme them .ix. or .x.M. mē at
the lest: with his aunswere y• messenger departed &amp; made relacion to the
erle of Essex &amp; other capitaynes whiche there wt were sore discontent: by
this time y• scowrers of the French parte were come harde to y• hādes of
the Englishmen: then began y• light horsmen to skyrmy she, ther was folowyng
and reskuing on both parties, &amp; in open sight some of both parties
slayne. Then marched forward the hole battaile of the Frenchmen
with stādards, penōs and banners waueryng, and sumptuous bardes,
&amp; riche harnys glyteryng, the men of armes in great nōber were in ranges
a long redy to chace and charge. Sir Rice ap Thomas beyng a mā
of great experience, sagely perceyued in what case ye matter stode, saide to
therle of Essex, sir we be not .vii.C. horsmē, let vs not be to folysh hardy,
our cōmission was to fette y• gonne &amp; none other, let vs folowe the same,
therle agreed therto &amp; so softely &amp; not in flyēg maner retreted &amp; folowed
y• gonne. The Frēchmē perceiuyng y•, cried al is ours let vs folowe, then
pricked forward .ii.M. men of armes &amp; came iuste to y• backes of ye Englishmen,
then thenglishmen cried sainct George &amp; cast them self about
and made retorne to ye Frenchmen, sir William Tyler &amp; sir Ihon sharpe
were y• first y• charged, and after all the other Englishemen, there was a
dreadfull chase, for the men of armes of Fraunce flede so fast, that glad
was he that might be formost, the hole hoost seynge ther horsmen returnyng
in flight, sodainly in great hast returned without any more doyng.
Then the erle of Essex staled to an hil, &amp; ther caused his trōpet to blowe
to the standard for feare of subtyll dealyng: and when thei were gathered
together vnto array, he returned.
               The .xxix. daye of Iuly the kyng with his army came to Arkus, and
there embattailed him selfe in a strong grounde, and to hym came therle
of Essex and the other capitaines with the gonne, and made reporte of
ther aduenture, which thanked them hartly, and ther he lay tyll Mōday
in which time came many noble men of Flaunders to visite him, &amp; many
of the common people came to se hym.
               Mondaye the fyrste daye of Auguste, the kynge remoued his campe
to a village myddell waly betwene Sayncte Omers and Tyrwyn, and
ther fell suche a rayne that the ordynaunce coulde scace be remoued

the arable grounde was so softe.
               Thursday the .iiii. day of August,Tirwyn, 
                        〈◊〉
                     . the kyng in good order of battaile
came before the citie of Tyrwyn &amp; planted his sege in most warlikewise,
his campe was enuironed with artilerie, as Fawcones, serpentynes, cast
hagbushes, and tryde harow
                     •
                  s, spien trestyls, and other warlike defence
for the sauegarde of the campe. The kyng for hym selfe had a howse of
tymber with a hymney of yron, &amp; for his other lodgynges he had great
and goodly tentes of blewe water worke garnyshed wt yelowe &amp; white,
diuerse romes within thesame for all offices necessary, on y• topp of ye pauilions
stode ye kynges bestes holdyng fanes, as y• Lion, y• Dragon, the
Greyhounde, the Antelope, the Dōne kow: within all the lodgynge was
poyncted full of the sunnes risynge, the lodgynge was .C.xxv. foot in
length.
               The king lyeng before Tirwyn, his great ordinaūce sore bet y• towne
walles, and thei within likewise shot out of the towne ordinaūce, &amp; slewe
diuers Englyshmen in the trenches, among which shottes thei had one
gonne that euery day &amp; night was ordinarely shotte at certayne howres
without fayle: this gonne was of Thenglishmen called the whystelyng
gonne, but it neuer did harme in the kynges feld. The siege thus lyeng
before the citee of Tyrwyn, sir Alexander Baynam a capitaine of y• 
                  
                     ••
                  yners,
caused a myne to be enterprised to enter into the towne, but the
Frenchmen perceyuyng that, made a countermyne and so destroyed the
other myne, and diuers myners slayne within the same. The Frenche army
houed euer a farre to take the Englishmen at auantage as thei went
a forragyng, &amp; many a skirmish was done, and many good feates of armes
acheued on bothe sydes, and diuers prisoners taken. Among the
Frenchmen were certaine light horsmen called Stradiotes with shorte
styroppes, beuer hatts, small speres, &amp; swerdes like Semiteries of Turkay:
dyuers tymes the northrē light horsmē vnder ye conduite of sir Ihō
Neuel skirmished with these stradiottes and toke diuerse of them prisoners,
and brought them to the kyng.
               While the kyng lay thus before Tyrwyn, the capitayne of Bullen
knowynge by hys espialles that many of the garryson of Caleys were
with the kynge at the siege, and also that daylye vitailes were brought
oute of Englande to Caleys to succour the campe, imagened a greate
entreprice and sent for all the men of warre vnder his dominion and
rule, and declared to them what honour they shoulde obteyne yf they
hurted or spoyled the out partes of Caleis, the kyng of England beyng
on that syde the see. The men of warre perceiuyng y• good courage of ye
capitaine, assented to his purpose, and so with all diligence they to the
nomber of a .M. men in the euenyng set forward, and came to Newnam
bridge by .iii. of the clock in the morning, and founde y• watchmē y• kept
the bridge a slepe, and so entred ye bulwerke &amp; slewe y• watchmen, &amp; toke
y• ordinaunce of ye bridge &amp; then let ye bridge fall, so y• al entred y• would.
The capitayn of Bulleyn kept .vi.C. men for a stale at y• bridge, &amp; sent ye
                  
other into the marrisshes and medowes where the Cattell fedde, and
some of the Frenshmen came to Caleys gate, &amp; were askryed of y• watch
and so rang alarme: the English souldiours ran to the walles, and saw
the Frenshmen without the toune walles: then thei knewe that Newnam
brydge was lost, and would haue issued out, but Sir Gylbert Talbott
deputie there, would not suffer any gate to be opened. Now it happened
that without Caleys gates were Richard Hunnyng &amp; Richard Brycks
of the Caterie, and .iii. or .iiii. of the kynges seruauntes whiche lay there
to sende prouisions to the hoost: which heryng of this alarme, called to
them the kynges barkers, and cowpers, and a fewe shippemen, which lay
in the hauen, and coragiously folowed the Frenchmen. Thenglishmen
were not past .vi. skore persones, and sett on y• Frenchmen as thei were a
forragyng or thei might assemble together, &amp; slew them doune right and
toke no prisoners in maner, and so thei came to Newnam brydge &amp; toke
it and put the Frenchmen backe. But or Thenglishmē had thus gathered
them selfes together, the Frenchmen had forraged all with in the riuer
vp to sainct Peters, and had driuen away the cattell and the ordinaunce
of Newnam brydge and so passed till they came where the stale
lay, and ther they taried lokyng for ther company that were gone a forragyng
to Caleys walles. About .v. of the clock in the morenyng, y• gate
of Caleys called Bulleyn gate, was opened, &amp; then issuyd out one Culpiper
the vnder marshall, with .ii.C. archers with the banner of Sainct
George, and with great hast came to Newnam bridge, where thei founde
the kynges seruauntes and the other that had wonne the brydge, and
then they all together marched toward the Frenchmen, which kepte the
stale. The Frenchmen thought it had ben there awne company that had
returned, till they saw the banner of sainct George, then they knewe that
their company were ouerthrowen, and that thei must nedes fight or dy.
Then thenglishmen though thei were the smaller nomber, valiantly set
on the Frenchmen, which with great force them defended, but at the last
thei were all discomfited and .xxiiii. slayne and .xii. skore taken prisoners
and ther ordinaunce and hole booty recouered.The foly of a Cowper. These prisoners were
brought to Caleys, and there sold in open market: Among all other a
Cowper of the towne of Caleys bought a prisoner of this booty y• dwelt
in Bulleyn, and had of the prisoner .C. crownes for his raunsome, and
when the mony was paied, the Frenchmen praied the Cowper to se hym
saue deliuered and to conduite hym out of danger, the Cowper gently
graunted and without any knowlege of his frendes, all alone went wt
the Frenchman tyll he came beyonde the Cawsey and ther woulde haue
departed: but the Frenchmen perceiued, that the Cowper was aged and
that no reskewes was ny, by force toke the Cowper prisoner &amp; caried him
to Bulleyn, and made hym paye .ii.C. crownes for his raunsome, thus
thorowe foly was the poore Cowper deceaued.
               The .xi. daie of August beyng thursday, the kynge lyeng at the siege
of Tyrwyn, had knowlege that Maximilian thēperour was in y• towne

of Ayre. The kyng prepared al thinges necessarie to mete with thempē
                  rour
in triumphe. The noble men of the kynges campe were gorgeously
apparelled, ther coursers barded of cloth of gold, of damaske &amp; broderie,
there apparell all tissue cloth of gold and syluer, and gold smithes
woorke, great cheynes of balderickes of gold, and belles of bullion, but
in especial y• duke of Buckingham, he was in purple satten, his apparell
and his barde full of Antelopes and swannes of fyne gold bullion and
full of spangyls and littell belles of gold meruelus costly and pleasāt
to behold. The kyng was in a garment of greate riches in iuels as perles
and stone, he was armed in a light armure, the master of hys horse
folowed him with a spare horse, the henxmen folowed beryng the kyngs
peces of harnys euery one mounted on a greate courser, the one bare the
helme, the seconde his graūgarde, the thirde his spere, the fourth his axe
and so euery one had 
                     •
                  ome thyng belongyng to a man of armes: the apparell
of the .ix. henxmen were white clothe of gold and crymsyn cloth of
gold, richely embrawdered with goldesmythes woorke, the trappets of
the corsers were mantell harneys coulpened, and in euery vent a longe
bel of fyne gold, and on euery pendant a depe tassel of fyne gold in bullion,
whiche trappers were very ryche. The kyng and themperour mett
betwene ayre and the camp, in the fowlest wether that lightly hath bene
sene. Themperour gentely enterteined the kyng, and the kyng lykewyse
hym, and after a littell communicacion had betwene them, by cause the
wether was foule, departed for that tyme. The Emperour and all his
men were at that daie all in black cloth for the Emprice his wife was lately
disseased. After that the kyng was this retorned to his campe, with
in a daye or twayne ther arryued in the army a kyng of armes of Scotlād
called Lyon with his cote of armes on his back, and desyred to speke
with the kyng, who with in shorte tyme was by Garter cheffe kynge
of armes brought to the kinges presence, where he beyng almost dismayed
seynge the kyng so nobly accompanied, with fewe woordes, and metely
good reuerence, deliuered a letter to the king, which receiued ye letter
and redde it him selfe and when he had redde it, without any more delay
he hym selfe aunswered after ths sorte. Nowe we perceyue the kynge of
Scottes our brother in lawe &amp; your master to be y• same person whome
we euer toke hym to be, for we neuer estemed hym to be of any truthe &amp;
so nowe we haue founde it, for notwithstandynge his othe, his promise
in y• woorde of kyng, &amp; his awne hand and seale, yet nowe he hath brokē
his faithe and promise to his great dishonour and infamie for euer, and
entendeth to inuade our realme in our absence whiche he dirst not ones
attempte, our person beynge presente, but he sheweth him selfe not to be
degenerate from the condicions of his forefathers, whose faythes for the
most parte hath euer byn violated and ther promises neuer obserued,
farther then they liste. Therfore tell thy master, first that he shall neuer
be comprised in any league where in I am a confederate, &amp; also that I
suspectyng his treuth (as now the dede proueth▪ haue left an earle in my

realme at home whiche shalbe able to defende him and all his powre, for
we haue prouided so, that he shall not fynde our land destitute of people
as he thynketh to do: but thus saye to thy master, that I am the very
owner of Scotlād, &amp; y• he holdeth it of me by homage, and in so much as
now contrary to his bounden duety he beinge my vassall, doth rebell against
me, wt Gods help I shal at my returne expulse him his realme, &amp;

                     •
                  o tell hym: sir sayd the kyng of Armes, I am his naturall subiecte, &amp; he
my naturall lord, &amp; y• he commaundeth me to say, I may boldely saye wt
fauor, but the commaundementes of other I may not, nor dare not saye

                  igne lord, but your letters may with your honour sent, declare
your pleasure, for I may not say suche woordes of reproche to him
whome I owe only my allegeaunce &amp; fayth. Then sayd the kyng, wherfore
came you hyther, wil you receyue no aunswere? yes sayde Liō, your
answere requireth doyng and no writynge, that is, that immediatly you
should returne home: well said the kyng I wyll returne to your domage
at my pleasure, and not at thy masters somonyng. Then the kyng commaunded
garter to take hym to his tente &amp; make hym good chere, which
so dyd, and cherished him wel for he was sore appalled: after he was departed,
the kynge sent for all the chefe capitaynes, and before them and
all his counsaill caused the letter to be redde, the trewe tenor whereof
foloweth woorde, by woorde.

               When this letter was written and sealed, the kynge sent for Lyon
the Scottysh heraulde, and declared to hym that he had wel considered
his mas
                     •
                  ets letter, and therto had made a reasonable answere, and gaue
to hym in rewarde a hundred angels, for which rewarde he humbly thā
                  ked
the kyng and so raried with gartier al might, and euer he sayde that
he was sory to thynke what domage shoulde be done in Englande by
his Master or the kynge returned, and so the nexte daye he departed into
Flaunders wyth hys Letter to haue taken shyppe to sayle in to
Scotlande, but or he coulde haue shyp and wynde hys master was
slayne.
               After the defyaunce declared by the kyng of Scottes herauld, y• king
of England wrote to the quene and other whiche he had left behynde of
his counsayll, to prepare in all hast for the defence of thesayde kynge of
Scottes, which so dyd wt great diligence as you shal here shortly after.
While the kyng lay thus at siege before Tirwyn, the Frenchmē studied
all the wayes possible how to vitayle the towne of Tirwyn▪ &amp; imagened
in a night by some waye to conuey vitayle to the towne: wherfore euery
day they sent ther stradiates to espie by which way thei might take their
most auantage, and many times the English horsmen mette wt the stradiates
and of them slewe parte.
               The Frenche kyng woulde in any wise that the kyng of Englande
shoulde be fought with all, wherefore he sent the duke of Uandosme,
The duke of Longuyle with diuerse other valiant captains to Blāgoy.
Then was ther a conclusiō taken that the duke of a lanson should wyth
v.M. men fight with the Earle of Shrewsburye, or els to kepe that nother
he nother the lord Harbert should ayde or come to the kynges battayle,
&amp; with the kyng should skyrmish the duke of Uandosme &amp; Longuyle,
while in the meane season the cariages with vitayle might entre
the towne. For accomplyshyng of this entreprice, the Frenchmen made

greate pur
                     ••
                  aunce and all on horsebacke, this was not so secretly cōcluded
but the kyng of England had an ynkelyng therof, and sent woorde
to the Emperour whiche lay at Ayre and knewe nothyng of this deuyse
and desyered hym to come to the campe to haue his aduyse: which gladly
aunswered that he woulde come the morowe after. The kyng contynually
sent foorth his light horses to seke the countrey and to se yf any
apparaunce were, and they euer brought tidynges of such thyng as thei
sawe, so that alwaies it was forsene that the kyng nor his people should
be taken vnpuruyed, nor the Frenchemen shoulde not come on them sodainly
vnaskryed.
               While these thynges were thus in commonynge and immagenyng.
Themperour Maximilian and all his seruauntes whiche were reteyned
with the kyng of England in wages by the day, euery person accordynge
to his degree, and Themperour as the kynges soldioure ware a
Crosse of sayncte George with a Rose, and so he and all hys trayne came
to the kynges campe the .xiii. daye of August beyng Frydaye, and there
was receyued eith greate magnyficence and brought to a tente of
cloth of golde all ready apparelled accordynge to his estate, for all the
tente within was syled with clothe of golde and blewe veluet, and all
the blewe veluet was embrowdered with .H.K. of fyne golde, and hys
cupboorde was rychely furnyshed and offycers appoyncted to geue on
hym attendaunce: and there he taried tyll Sonday, and from thence he
went agayne to Ayre for his pleasure. The kyng and his counsaill were
informed by their espialles, and also yt was confessed by certayne prysoners,
howe the Frenche armye whiche lay at Blangoy, entended to vitayle
the cytee of Tyrwyn. Wherfore on Frydaye at nyght, the .xiii. day
of August the Duke of Buckyngham, the Earle of Essex, the Marques
Dorsett the Lorde of Burgaynye, the Lord Willoghby, and dyuerse
other gentlemen with .vi. thousande men on foote and the Lorde
Walon and the Lorde Ligny with ther horsemen were layed at Gyngate
on the south syde of Tyrwyn, where they were all nyghte in order
of battayle, awaytynge the reskewe of the cytee, but the Englishmen
were askryed, and so the Frenchmen brake there purpose for that tyme:
and so the Duke of Buckyngham and his compaygnions returned to
the campe. Monday the .xiii. daye of August by infortune, with oute
any cause knowen, there fell a greate debate betwene the Almaynes
of the kynges felde and Thenglyshemen, in 
                     •
                  o muche that they fell to
fyghtynge and many men slayne, the Almaynes sodaynely ran to the
kynges ordynaunce and toke yt, and embattayled them selfes, and bent
the ordynaunce agaynste the kynge and his campe. Thenglishemē were
greately fumed with this matter: in so muche the archers sett forwarde
to haue ioyned with the Almaynes, and they lykewyse prepared there
pykes, but the capytaynes tooke suche payn
                     •
                   that the fray was appesed
and al things done for that time▪ but as this cōmocion was in trouble,
the Emperour came from Ayre and saw all the demener of both parties

and was glad to se the discrete handelyng of the capitaynes. After
Themperour was come to the kynges felde, the kyng called Thēperour
and all the lordes of his counsayll togither asserteynyng them that he
was credybly enformed that the Frenchmen entended to reskewe the cytee
of Tyrwyn, wherefore it was agreed that the master of the ordynaunce
shoulde in haste make fyue bridges ouer the water for the army
to passe ouer, to thentent to besege the cytee on that syde: the carpenters
dyd so there deuer that nyght, so that by daye all the brydges
were made, so that all the horsemen passed ouer and askryed the countrey.
On Twesdaye the .xvi. daye of August the kyng reysed hys campe
and with greate ordinaunce and all other artilerye and cariage he
passed the Ryuer, and to hym came Sir Ihon Neuell with hys lyghte
horsemen and tolde him that behinde the tower of Gyngate was a great
plumpe of horsemen. In the meane season, as Sir Ihon Neuell tolde
the kynge these tydynges, by a nother waye was therle of Essex Sir
Ihon Peche and the kynges speres passed and skyrmyshed wyth the
plumpe of speres that Sir Ihon spake of, and there were many profets
made on bothe sydes, but in conclusion the Frenchemen were compelled
to leaue their stale, and one horseman taken and sente to the kyng whiche
in hope of pardon of his Raunsome shewed howe that the Frenche
army wyth their full power and strength were commynge from Blangoy
the nomber of fyften thowsande horsemen of armes to ayde Tyrwyn
on that syde of the water. And to thentente that the armye of the
Lorde Stuarde and the Lorde Chamberlayne shoulde not ayde the
kynge, there were appoyncted .v. thousande of the .xv. thousande horsemen
on the other syde of the water. As these tydynges was tolde came
one from Sir Ryce, and sayde that a prisoner that he had that daye taken
confessed that the cytee shoulde be reskowed the same daye, and
that he had askryed a nomber of horsemen to hys iudgemente vppon
the poynct of syx thowsand. Then sodaynely came the Northren men
whyche affirmed that they had sene the Frenche armye in order of
battayle commynge forwarde, but they iudged them not past twelfe
thowsande men. Then the kynges felde was pytched and the ordynaunce
sett, but some counsaylled the kynge to take downe hys tentes
but the kynge sayde I wyll thys daye that my felde be made and
sett in as royall wyse as maye bee, and all my ryche tentes sett vpp,
whyche was done. Then the Kynge called the Lorde Darcy, and
commaunded hym to kepe hys felde, treasure ordynaunce and other
stuffe, whyche was lothe too goo from hys Master but by streyte
commaundemente. Then euerye man prepared hym selfe to battayle
resortynge to the standarde, the horsemen marched before the
footmen by the space of a myle, styll came curroures berynge tydynges
that the Frenche armye approched. The kynge had sette forwarde
and to auaunce hys banner in name of GOD and Sainct George.
The Almaynes seynge this (to what purpose yt was not

knowen) sodainly embatteled them selfes on the left hande of the kyng
and left the brest or fronte of the kyngs battayle bare. As the kyng was
thus marchyng forwarde towarde the battaile, to him came the Emperour
Maximilian with .xxx. men of armes he and all his companye armed
in on sute with redde crosses: then by the counsayll of the Emperour
the kynge caused certaine peces of small ordinaunce to be laied on
the toppe of a long hill or banke for the out skowerers: Thus the kynges
horsemen and a few archers on horsebakce marched forwarde. The
kyng woulde fayne haue been afore with the horsmen, but his counsayll
perswaded him the contrary, and so he taried with the footmē accompanied
with themperour.
               The Frenchmen came on in .iii. ranges .xxxvi. mens thickenes &amp; well
thei perceiued the kynges battayle of footmen marchyng forwarde: the
erle of Essex capitayne of the horsmen, and sir Ihō P
                     ••
                  he with the kynges
horsmen and the Burgonyons to the nomber of a .xi.C. stode wyth
banner displayed in a valey. The lorde Walonne and the lorde Ligny
with bastarde Emery and there bende to the nomber of .iiii.C. horsmen
seuered them selfes and stode a syde from the Englishmen: so then thenglishmen
were but .vii.C. yet they with banner displayed remoued vp
to the toppe of the hill, and there they mett with sir Ihon Gylforde a .C.
talle archers on horsebacke, whiche had askryed the Frenchemen. Nowe
on the topp of the hill was a fayre plaine of good grounde, on the left
hand a lowe wodde, and on the right hand a 
                     •
                  alowe felde. The lord Walonne
and the Burgomons kept them a loofe, then appered in sight the
Frenchmen with banners and standardes displaied. Then came to the
capitaynes of Thenglishmen of armes, an English officer of armes called
Clarenseux and sayde, in Gods name sett forward, for the victorie is
yours for I see by them, they will not abide, and I will goo with you
in my coate of armes. Then the horsmen sett forward, and the archers a
lighted and were set in order by an hedge all a long a village side called
Bomye: the Frenchmen came on with .xxxiii. standardes displayed, and
the archers shotte a pace and galled ther horses, and the English speres
sett on freshly, cryēg sainct 
                     •
                  eorge, &amp; fought valiantly with the Frenchmen
and threw downe ther standarde, the dust was great and the crye
more, but sodainly the Frenchmen shocked to ther standarde and fledde,
and threw away there speres, swerdes, and mases and cut of the bardes
of ther horses to ronne the lighter, when the hinder parte saw the former
fly, they fledde also, but the soner for one cause which was this. As y• English
horsmen mounted vpp the hill, the stradiates were cōmyng downe
wardes on the one syde of the hill before the French hoste, which sodainly
saw the banners of the English horsmen, and the kynges battayle folowyng
vpwarde, wenyng to them that all had been horsmen, then they
cast them self about and fledde, the Frenchmen were so fast in array that
the stradiates could haue not entre, and so thei ranne still by thēdes of y•
ranges of the French army: and when they behynde saw the fall of their

standardes and their stradiates in whome th
                     •
                  i had greate confidence retorne,
thei that were farthest of fledde firste, then vp pranced the Burgonyons
and folowed the chace: this battaile was of horsmen to horsmē
but not in eg
                     •
                  l nomber, for the Frenchmen were .x. to one, which had not
byn sene before tyme, that Thenglishe horsemen gatt the victory of the
men of armes of Fraunce.The iourney of Spurres. The Frenchmen call this battaile the iourney
of Spurres by cause thei rāne away so fast on horsbacke. This battaile
was the .xvi. daye of August, in the whiche battayle was taken the
duke of Longuyle, loys brother to therle of Dunoys which had maried
the Marques of Rutilons heyre, the lorde Cleremounde and many other
noble men to the nomber of .xii. skore and all brought to the kynges
presence, and lykewyse all the standardes and banners were
brought to the kyng. The Burgoniōs kept ther prisoners and brought
them not to sight. The fame wēt that Moūsire dela Palayce was by them
taken and lett goo. Thenglyshemen folowed the chace .iii. myle longe
from the felde to a water in a valey, and there a Frenchman sayde to
Sir Gyles capell that one daye they woulde haue a daye, whiche aunswered
hym agayne in Frenche that it was a bragge of Fraunce: and so
Thenglishemen returned to the kynge, whiche was commyng forward
who gaue them thankes with greate praisynges for ther valiantnes,
and ther he made Sir Ihon Peche bannarett and made Ihon Car
Knyght which was sore hurt, and sir Ihon Peche had his guyd home taken
and diuers of his men hurt, they folowed so farre. Then the kyng
retreted to Gyngate, to whome came sir Rise and shewed hym how hoat
the Frenchmen had skyrmyshed with hym all daye on the other syde of
the ryuer, and how therle of Shrewsbury with banner displaied was al
daye prest in order of battayle to haue fought with the duke of Alanson
and therle of sainct Polle and the lord of Florenges which with .v. M.
men as you haue harde were appoincted to reskewe the towne on that
syde where the lord of Shrewsburye lay, and to let hym to come to ayde
the kyng, but how so euer that it happened, they stode still and came not
downe but only skyrmyshed with Sir Rice: The citie of Tyrwyn was
this daye in hope of ayde, and when thei saw ther helpers cōmyng n
                     •
                  re,
therthesame daye proudely issued out on the lord Harbert &amp; skirmyshed
with his people very valiantly, and they within also shott out ordinaūce
of all partes. The lorde Harbert and his capitaines coragiously defended
them, and so sore they sett on the Frenchmē, that they dra
                     •
                  e them
by force to ther gates for all ther succours, and many of them were slayne:
this night the kyng sent for the duke of Long
                     •
                  uyle and the lord Cleremounde
and diuerse other noblemen, and the duke supped at y• kyngs
borde that nyght.
               Then the Frenchmen after this discomfyture assembled together and
returned to Blangoy .xii. myle from the coste, and there talked of there
losses, and because they knewe not who were taken and who were s
                     •
                  ayn,
therefore they sent an heraulde to the kyng to knowe the nomber of the

prisoners, the kynges counsayll accordynge to there desyer sent to them
the names. The kyng beyng assertayned that the Frenche kynges purpose
was yet agayne to geue hym battayle, commaunded the best of the
prisoners shoulde be conueyed to the towne of Ayre in Flaunders: but
when Thenglyshmen had brought them thyther, the capitayne denyed
that Thenglishmen shoulde entre the towne with prisoners of Fraunce
with whome he and his countrey had peace: but yf the Frenchemen
woulde desyre lodgyng for there ease, they shoulde be permytted to en
                  
                     •
                  re.
But thenglishmen in a fury aunswered, that yf you wyll not suffer
vs to kepe our prisoners, we will slay them: then the Frenchmen mekely
praied the capitayne to suffer the Englishemen to entre, and sware to
their kepers to be trewe prysoners, and so they entered, and after were
conueyed into England. The Lorde Powntremy of the howse of Cresquy
capitayne generall of Tyrwyn perceyued the discomfiture of the
Frenche partie, and perceyued howe the Earle of Shrewsburye and the
Lorde Harbert had brought thither greate ordinaunce so nere the toune
that nerer it coulde not be brought, and that in the walles was suche
batterie that it was not lyke to continue, yet he manfully defended the
cytee and shotte gonnes euery daye as he was accustomed and neuer
was in despayre, tyll the .xviii. daye of thesayde moneth he sawe the
kynge remoue his campe from Gyngate and layed his campe on the
southe syde of the towne betwene there reskewe and the toune: then
when he sawe this and consydered that hys succour
                     •
                  s were put backe
and that the towne was sore febeled, and that the kynges greatest ordinaunce
was bent agaynst the towne, he therfore by the aduyse of other
capytaynes sent to therle of Shrewsburye and the Lorde Harb
                     •
                  rte a
trumpett, desyerynge abstinence of warre for a daye, they incon
                     •
                  ynente
sent to the kynge to knowe his pleasure, the kynge aunswered that he
woulde not graunte till he knewe the consideracion: then the capitayne
sent woorde that with saufeconduyte he would come and speke with the
kynges counsayll, whyche to hym was graunted, then he sent certayne
commyssioners whyche offered to delyuer the towne with all the ordynaunce
and municions without any fraude, so that the townes men that
woulde there dwell myght haue life and goodes safe, and that y• men of
warre myght departe wyth horse and harneys, for goodes they sayde
they had none, and there horse and harneys was of lytell valure to so
greate a prynce. After that the kyng and his counsayll had debated this
matter, it was aunswered the commissioners that allthough the kynge
knewe ther penury of vitayle and the dayly mortalite among them and
that the towne by reason of great batteries was not able long to resiste,
yet by cause they asked marcy he woulde not extende 
                     •
                  igor, and graunted
there requeste: so that they delyuered the towne with all the ordynaunce
as they had promysed, to the whyche all they were sworne,
and so returned. And thesame nyght Therle of Shrewsburye

entred the toune and had the walles and towers and the banner of saint
George was set in the highest place in signe of victory, &amp; the lord Powtremy
with al the garryson departed with horse and harneys accordyng
to the appoinctemente. Then the lord George Talbott erle of Shrewsburye,
with .iii.C. men ser
                     •
                  hed the towne for fere of treason or that any
inconuenience might be vnto the kyng and his people: and after that he
saw all thing suer, he called al the townes men together, and sware them
to be trewe to the kyng of England. When all this was done, the kyng
on the .xxiiii. daye of August entered into the cytye of Tyrwyn at .ix. of
the clocke before noone with great triūphe and honour, his persone was
apparelled in armure gylt and grauen, his garment and barde purple
veluet full of borders, and in all places trauersed with branches in ronnyng
worke of fyne golde, the branches were of hawthorne wrought by
goldesmythes crafte wounde with a braunche of Roses, and euery 
                     ••
                  ower,
lefe &amp; bury were enbossed: After whome folowed his henxmen with
the peces of armure accustomed. Thus with greate glorye this goodly
prince entered and toke possession of the towne of Tyrwyn and was receiued
at the Cathedrall church with procession, and they harde masse &amp;
dyned in the bi

                  oppes palyce, and at after none retorned to his campe,
leuynge in the towne the Earle of Shrewsbury with his retinue. The
xxvi. daye of August the kyng remoued agayn to Gyngate, and there it
was agreed that the walles, gates,

                        •
                     ed. bulwarkes and towers of Tyrwyn
should be defaced, rased and cast downe: of whiche conclusion the Emperour
sent word to sainct Omers, and to Ayre, which beyng Ioyous of
that tidynges (for Tyrwyn was to them a scorge) sent thyther pyoners
with al maner of instrumentes, and so they and thenglish pioners brake
downe the walles, gates and towers of the foundacion &amp; filled the diche
and fyered the towne, except the Cathedrall church and the palayce, and
all the ordinaūce was by the kyng sent to Ayre, to be kept to his vse. After
this, it was concluded that the kyng in person should ley his siege to
the citee or towne of Turney, wherfore he set forwarde three goodly battayles,
the first was conduyted by therle of Shrewsbury, the seconde
battayle ledde the kyng hym selfe with whome was Themperour. The
rereward was conduyted by the lord Harbert: and so the first night theilaye
in campe besyde Ayre, whiche night vitaile was skant, diuerse Englishmen
tarried in Tyrwyn when the kynge was past for pillage &amp; fyred
certayne howses, on whome came sodainly the French stradiates, &amp;
some they slew and some they caste into the fier, they that fledde, scaped
narrowly.
               Wednesday the .xiiii. daie of Septēber the kyng and his army came
to Beatwyn, and there had plentie of all thynges, and on the morowe he
with his army passed forward and came to a strayt where was a foorde
and all the carriages must nedes come downe a stepe hill to the foorde &amp;

                     •
                  o to the streyt, where as one wagon scace alone might passe, and the wether
was hoat and the beastes had not dronke all daye, wherfore at the

foorde the horses woulde drynke ma
                     •
                  gre ther leders, and so the carriages
wēt not all hole together which was a dowtfull case, but yet by wise
order thei passed the streyte &amp; so dyd the army &amp; came to a place betwene
Cauon and Camblyne and there lodged that night in a playne barren
grounde, and the next daye he remoued his campe and the forward passed
a bridge called pount Auandien into Flaunders syde &amp; there lay, the
kyng lay at the other ende of the bridge on Arthoys syde, &amp; the rereward
lay in a fayre grounde behynde the kyng.
               Saterday the .xvii. day of September tidinges came to y• kyng how
the Frenchmen had assembled a great puissaūce &amp; would fight with the
king, wherfore the king caused his forward to remoue farther &amp; sent the
Almaynes to kept the passage the pount dassaus. Then the great ordynaunce
passed the bridge of pount auandien and the king was remoued
frō thence &amp; as his tentes wre takyng vp, an askrye was made that the
enemies were in sight, which noyse was sodainly seased and sir William
Sandes with .vii.C. Englishmē &amp; strangers was appoincted to kepe y•
bridge and certayne ordinaunce was to him appoincted.
               When the kyng and all the carriages were passed, then the lord Harbert
remoued ouer the bridge and encamped hym behynde the kyng by
a fayre mylle, when the kynge was 
                     •
                  ncamped and all thynges in order,
there came to hym a noble man of Flaunders called the lorde Rauesten
which after his humble reuerence done, shewed the kyng that the young

to come and repose in his towne of Lysle and to see his brother y• prynce

The kyng gentelly graunted his request, &amp; then he sent his officers thether

Marques Dorsett therle of Essex and the lord Lysle and dyuerse other

Tournay and lodged within .iii. myles of the cytie, on a corne grounde
by the ryuer. The whiche nyght came to the kyng Themperour and the
Paulsgraue whiche were lodged in ryche tentes and nobly serued of
all vyandes and thynges necessarye. The people aboute Tournay
were wyth there goodes fledde to the cytie, and yet the cytie had no
men of warre to defende yt, but with multytude of inhabitauntes the

cytee was well replenished: the kyng cōmaunded sir Rice and his horsemen
to vewe one quarter, and therle of Essex and his company another
quarter, and the lord Walowne &amp; the lord Ligny the other quarters: so
the .xxii. day of september these .iiii. capitains at one tyme were sone opē

he might vewe the walles and the towers very well: they shotte out of

Then they rong the alarme bell, which was harde wel in the felde. Then
the citezens issued out at the gate by the ryuer and manfully profered to

English carriers that came with the harbeshers to take ground ranne to
the gates of Tornay, and toke certayne wagons with beere and vitayle
and yet the Turnoyes dyrst not resiste, although they were in greater

Cariours was

he caused immediatly .xxi. peces of great artilery to be brought in a plain
feld before the towne, and when thei were charged▪ thei were immediatly
shotte, &amp; the most parte of the stones fell with in the cytee, &amp; so thei shotte
diuerse shottes one after another.
               Then the kyng with all his battayle planted hys siege on the northe
parte of the citee: Therle of Shrew

                  bury with his battayle warded towarde
the south syde of the ryuer and there lay that nyght. The Lorde
Harbert with the rerewarde plāted hts battall on the west syde of the citee▪
and with great ordynaunce daily bett the walles and towers of the
citee. On the morowe beynge the .xxiii. daie: the Lorde Talbott Erle of
Shrewsbury accompanied with the noble men of his battaill whose names
you haue harde at his first passyng the see, passed ouer the ryuer of
Tornay and planted his siege on the southe syde stretchyng to the east
ende of the citee, &amp; bent his artilery against the walles of the citee. Thus
was the citee of Tornay beseged on all partes, &amp; euer in hope of reskue
valiantly defended her selfe.
               Nowe must I leue the kynge at the siege of Turnay, and diuerte to
thinges done in England in his absence, and declare howe the kynge of
Scottes inuaded the realme of Englande, and howe he was defended
and fought with al, and in conclusion slayn the .vii. daye of this moneth
of September.
               When the kynge of Englande was determined in his high court of
Parliament to passe the see, in proper person for the recouery of his realme
of Fraunce, he and his counsaill forgatt not the olde Prankes of

should reyse the powers of the contrey of Chester, Lancaster, Duresme
Northumberlande, Westmerlande, and Comberland, besyde other aydes
to be apoyncted by the quene. And whē the kyng should take ship
at Douer, he toke the erle by the hande, and sayde, my lorde I trust not
the Scottes, therfore I pray you be not negligent, then sayde the erle
I shall so do my duety, that your grace shall fynde me diligent, and to
fulfill your will shalbe my gladnes: Therle coulde skantly speake whē
he toke his leaue, for the departing frō the noble prynce hys souereigne

settelled in hys mode, he sayde to some that were about hym: Sory may

meanynge thesame by the kynge of Scottes. From Douer he attendid
on the quene to London, comfortynge her the best he myght, and shortely
sent for hys gentelmen and tenauntes, whiche were .v.C. able men,
whiche mustered before syr Thomas louel, knyght, the .xxi. daye of Iuly,
and the .xxi. daye he rode thorough London Northwarde, and came
to Dancaster, and there commaunded syr William bulmer knight, to
make haste to the marches of Scotlande, and to lye in the castels and
fortresses on the frontiers with .ij.C. archers and horsebacke: for the erle
by open tokens dayly perceiued that y• Scottes entended warre. Then
the sayde syr William with all spede departed and came to the borders
and the erle came to Pomfret, the first daye of August, &amp; there taried.
After that syr William bulmer was come to the borders, one daye in
August, the lorde Chamberlayne and warden of Scotland with .vii. or
viii. M. men with banner displayed entered into England, and brent &amp;
haryed a great praye in Northumberland: that hering syr Williā bulner,
called to hym the gentelmen of the borders with his archers, and al
they were not a thousand men. And when they were nere assembled, they
brought thē selfes in to a brome felde, called Mylfeld, where the Scottes
should passe. And as y• Scottes proudely returned with their pray,
the Englishmen brake oute, and the Scottes on fote like men them defended,
but the archers shotte so holy together, that they made y• Scottes
geue place, and .v. or .vi. hundred of them were slayne, and .iiii. hundred
and more taken prisoners, and the pray reskued beside a great nū
                  ber
of geldinges▪ that were taken in the countrey, and the lorde Hume▪
lorde Chamberlayne fled, &amp; his banner taken. This was the fyrst open
token of warre, shewed by the Scottes, whiche call this iourney the yll
Roade.
               The erle of Surrey, beyng at Pomfred, called to hym the most parte

of the Gentelmen of the Counties to hym apoynted as is before rehersed,
declaringe to them the kynges hygh commaundement, shewynge
them, that he beynge there the kynges Lieutenaunt muste nedes haue

brynge euery thynge in dew order: Fyr

                  t they toke a determinacion
with syr Philippe Tylney knight, Treasurer of the warres, howe the
charges shoulde be payde, and secondarely with syr Nycholas applyarde,
master of the ordinaunce▪ for the conueyaunce of the kynges royall
ordinaunce, pouder and artillerie to Newcas
                     •
                  ell, and so forwarde
as the case shoulde requyer, whiche syr Nycholas by William Blacknall,
clercke of the kynges spycerie, sent the saide ordinaunce and artillerie
to Durham before, so that all thynges, concerning that office were
in a redynes. The erle forgat not to sende too all lordes Spirituall
and Temporall, Knyghtes, Gentelmen, or other whiche had tenauntes,
or were rulers of tounes or liberties (able to make men) to certifie what
number of able men horsed and haruesed, they were able to make within
an houres warnynge &amp; to geue there attendaunce on hym, and also
he layed Postes euery waye, whiche Postes stretched to the marches
of Wales to the counsayll there, by reason whereof, he had knowlege
what was done in euery coste.
               The erle was enformed by the lorde Dacres, of the numbrynge
and preparynge of men in Scotlande, and Proclamacions soundinge
to the breche or peace, and yet though he considered that the Roade
made by the lorde Chamberlayne of Scotlande into Englande, beyng
distrussed by syr William Bulmer, as is a
                     •
                  ore rehersed, was an open
breche of the perpetuall peace: yet the sayde lorde Dacres auysed the
the earle for many and greate weyghty causes, not to reyse or styrre the
powers of the countrey, to hym appoynted tyll he mighte perceyue and
openly know the subtyle purpose and entent of the Scottes aforesaid,
lest if the Scottes had perceyued the Englishemen redy to fighte they
woulde haue desisted of theyr purpose 
                     •
                  or that tyme, tyll the Englishemen
were returned to theyr countreys, and then sodaynely too ryse agayne.
               Then the Erle knowynge that the towne of Barwycke was strōg
ynough, sent to the Capitayne of Norham, certefienge hym, that if he
thought the Castell in anye daungier or debylitie, he woulde put hym
selfe in a readynes to reskew it, if it were beseged, the Capitayn wrote
to the Erle, thankynge hym and prayed GOD that the Kynge of
Scottes woulde come wyth hys puyssaunce, for he woulde kepe hym
playe tyll the tyme that the Kynge of Englande came oute of Fraunce
to reskew it, whiche aunswer reioysed the Erle muche.
               
                  
came out of Fraunce, to reskewe it, whiche aunswer reioysed the Erle
muche.
               After the kynge of Scottes had sent hys defyaunce to the kynge of
Englande, lyenge before Tyrwyn, as you haue harde, he dayly made
hys musters, and assembled hys people ouer all hys realme, whereof
the brute was that they were two hundred thousand, but for a suertye
they were an hundred thousand good lightynge men at the lest, &amp; wyth
all hys hoste and power entered into Englande (and threw doune pyles)
the .xxii. daye of August, and planted hys siege before the Castell
of Norham, and sore abated the walles. The erle hard tydynges
thereof the fyue and twenty day of August, beynge saynct Barthelmewes
daye.
               Then he wrote to all the gentelmen of the shyres aforesayde, to be

retynew accordynge to the certificat. On the morow, he with his fyue
hundred men came to Yorke, and the .xxvi. daye he went toward Newcastell,
and not withstandyng that he had the fowlest day and nyght y•
could be, and the wayes so depe, in so much that hys guyde was almost
drouned before hym, yet he neuer ceased, but kept on hys iorney to geue
example to them that should folow. He beyng at Durham was aduertised
how the kyng of Scottes with hys greate ordinaunce had rased
teh walles of the Castell of Norham, and had made thre great Assaultes
thre dayes together, and the Capitayne valyauntly defended hym,
but he spent vaynely so muche of hys ordinaunce, bowes and arrowes
and other municions that at the laste he lacked, and so was at the .vi.
daye compelled to yelde hym symply to the kynges mercy. This castell
was thought impregnable, if it had bene well fu
                     •
                  nished, but the Scottes
by the vndiscrete spendynge of the Capitayne, toke it in sixe dayes:
thys chaunce was more sorowfull to the erle then to the Bishoppe owner
of thesame. All that nyghte the wynde blewe corragiously, wherfore
the erle doubted least, the lorde Hawarde hys sonne greate Admyrall
of Englande shoulde perishe that nyght on the sea, who promised
to lande at Newcastell with a thousand men, to accompaynie hys father,
whyche promyse he accomplished.

                  e made to the kyng of Scottes
by Elyzabeth Heron, wyfe to William Heron of Forde, nowe prysoner
in Scotlande, for castynge doune of the house or Castell of Forde, and
as thesayde Elizabeth reporteth vppon communicacion had, thesayde
kynge hath promysed and condiscended to thesayde Elizabeth, that if
she any tyme before none, the fift daye of September, woulde brynge
and deliuer vnto hym the lorde Iohnstowne, and Alexander Hume,
then prysoners that tyme in Englande, he then is contented and agreed
that thesayde house or Castell shall stande without castynge doune,
brennynge or spoylynge thesame: Whereunto thesayde erle is content
with that, vppon thys condicion that if thesayde kynge wyll promytte

case thesayde kynge can and will be content to delyuer thesayde Heron
oute of Scotlande, then thesayde erle shall cause to be deliuered to the
sayde kynge the two gentelmen and two other, syr George Hume and
William Carre.
               Farther thesayde erle woll that you Rouge Crosse, shewe the
sayde kyng, that where he contrary to hys othe and league, and vnnaturally
agaynste all reason and conscience, hathe entred and inuaded
thys hys brothers realme of Englande, and done great hurte to the
same, in castynge doune Castelles, Towers and houses, brenninge,
spoylynge and destroiynge of the same, and cruelly murderynge the
kynge of Englande hys brothers subiectes. Wherefore thesayde
erle wyll be readye too trye the rightfulnes of the matter wyth the king
in battaill by Frydaye nexte commynge at the farthest, if he of hys noble
courage wyll geue hym tarienge, and abode, within thys the kynges
Realme so longe tyme: And the same thesayde erle promiseth,
as he is true knyghte to God and the Kynge of Englande hys master.
And before Rouge Crosse shoulde departe with thesayde instruccions,
thesayde lorde Admyrall gaue hym in credence too shewe
thesayde Kynge of hys commynge, and parte of hys compaignye on
the sea with hym: and that he hadde soughte the Scottyshe Nauye,

caused thesayde lorde, too be called at dayes of true, too make redresse
for Andrew Barton, a Pirate of the sea, longe before that vanquyshed
by thesame lorde Admyrall, he was nowe come in hys awne

he nor none of hys compaignye shoulde take no Scottshe noble man
prysoner, nor any other, but they shoulde dye if they came in hys daunger,

               And in thys maner he shoulde fynde hym in the Uauntgarde of
the felde by the grace of GOD and sayncte George as he was a trew
knyghte. Yet before the departynge of Rouge Crosse with thesayde
instruccions and credence, it was thoughte by the E

                  le and hys counsayll,
that thesayde kynge woulde fayne and Imagen some other message,

at the nyghest, where thesayde Erle woulde come, and heare what he
would saye: And thus departed Rouge Crosse with his trumpet apparayled
in hys Cote of armes.
               On Mondaye the

                  ynewes too the number of
of six and twenty thousande men, and aboute mydnighte next ensuyng,
came the trompette, whiche went with Rouge Crosse, and declared how
the kynge of Scottes, after the message done to hym by Rouge Crosse
accordynge too hys instruccions, thesayde Kynge detayned hym, and
sent on Ilay a Harauld of hys wyth hym vnto the Erle, to declare too
hym thesayde Kynges pleasure, too whome the Erle sente Yorke Heraulde
at armes, to accompaignie thesayde Ilay, at a Uillage called
Mylo, twoo myles from the felde, vntyll the commynge thether of thesayde
Erle the next morow.
               The sixt daye of September, early in the mornynge, the Erle accompaignied
with the moost parte of the lordes, knyghtes and gentelmen
of the felde, euery man hauynge with hym but one man too holde
hys horsse, and so thesayde Heraulde met with the erle, and with b

                  oūt
reuerence declared hym that he was come from hys master the Kynge
of Scottes, whiche woulde knowe, whither the Erle sente anye suche
message by Rouge Crosse, the Erle iustified thesame, saiynge farther,
that Rouge Crosse hadde thesame message of hym in writynge signed
with hys awne hande, whereunto thesayde Ilay sayde, as touchynge
the sauynge from brennynge or destroiynge, and castynge doune of the
Castell of Forde, for the deliueraunce of thesayde prisoners, The kyng

hys master woulde thereto make no aunswer. But as too the abydynge
for battayll betwene that and Frydaye, then nexte folowynge,
the kynge hys master badde hym shewe too the Earle, that he was as
welcome as any noble man of Englande vnto thesame kynge, and that

the kynge hys masters behalfe, that thesame kynge woulde abyde him
vattayll at the daye prefixed, whereof thesayde erle was righte ioyous
and muche praysed the honourable agrement of thesayde royall kynge

               Then Ilay deliuered too the Earle a littell Cedule, wryten
with the kynges Secretaries hande vnsigned, the tenor whereof foloweth.
               
                  ¶As to the cause alleged of oure commynge into Englande
agayne, oure bande and promyse (as is alleged) thereto we aunswer,
ower brother was bounde also farre to vs as we to hym. And when
we sware laste before hys Ambassade, in presence of oure counsayll, we
expressed specially in oure othe, that we woulde kepe to oure brother, if
oure brother kepte to vs, and nat elles, we sweare oure brother brake
fyrste to vs, and sythe hys breke, we haue requyred dyuerse tymes hym
too amend, and lately we warned oure brother as he dyd not vs or he
brake and thys we take for oure quarell, and with Goddes grace shal
defende thesame at youre affixed tyme, whiche with Goddes grace we
shall abyde.
               
               And for asmuche as thesayde Kynge kepte styll Rouge Crosse
with hym, who was not yet returned, thesame Earle caused thesayde
Ilay too be in the kepynge of Syr Humfrey Lysle and Yorke
Heraulde, in thesame Vyllage, vntyll the tyme that a seruaunt
of thesayde Ilay myghte ryde in all haste too the royall Kynge of

Scottes, for the deliuerynge of thesayde Rouge Crosse. Then the
erle Ioyous of the kynges aūswer, returned to hys campe, and fet forwarde
fyue myle, too a place called Woller Hawgh, in suche order of
battayll, as euen then he should haue fought, and there lodged for that
nighte, three littell myles from the kynge of Scottes, and betwene the
kynge and hym was a goodly and large corne felde, called Mylfelde
whiche was a conuenient and fayre grounde for twoo hostes too fight
on, there euery hoste myghte perceyue other.
               The morowe beynge Wednysdaye, the .vii. daye of that moneth,
the kynge of Scottes caused hys greate ordinaunce too be shotte at
the Englishe armye, but it hurte neither man nor beast. When the
kynge of Scottes sawe that Ilay was deteyned, he sent awaye Rouge
Crosse to the erle, by whome, and other of the borders he was aduertised
that the kynge laye vppon the syde of a hyghe mountayne, called
Floddon on the edge of Cheuyot, where was but one narow felde for
any man to ascende vp thesayde hyll to hym, and at the foote of the hyll
laye all hys ordinaunce. On the one syde of hys armye was a greate
Marrishe, and compassed with the hylles of Cheuyot, soo that he laye
to stronge too be approched of any syde: excepte the Englishmen
would haue temerariously ronne on hys ordinaunce, whiche matter
well considered by the Erle and hys sonne, and other of the counsayll
there, they called too theim Rouge Crosse, and sent hym the nexte daye
to the kynge of Scottes, willinge hym too shewe the kynge, that the
sayde erle, with dyuerse of the kynges nobles and subiectes hadde avaunced
them selfes too geue battayll too hys grace, trustynge that
accordinge too hys promise, he woulde auaunce hym selfe and hys armye
to ioyne the battayll, whiche as yet he hath not done. Wherefore he
desyred the kynge that he myghte haue knowlege by noone that daye,
whether he of hys noble courage woulde discende the hyll, where he lay
and too geue battayll or not: and if he saye that I shall not knowe hys
entent, or wyll saye, that he will kepe the grounde: then shewe hym that
he perceyueth well that that place is no indifferent grounde for twoo
armyes too fighte, and therefore I will looke for no mo of his delayes.
The same daye beynge oure Ladye daye the Natiuite Rouge Crosse
departed to the kyng of Scottes, whiche woulde not heare hym speke,
but sente one of hys seruitours to heare hys message, Whiche seruitour
after he hadde disclosed the same to the kynge, made aunswer, that it
besemed not an erle, after that maner too handle a kynge, and that he
woulde vse no sorcery, nor had no trust of any grounde:
               You haue hearde before, howe Ilay the Scottishe Heraulde was
returned for Rouge Crosse, and as s
                     •
                  ne as Rouge Grosse was returned,
he was discharged, but he taryed with Yorke an English Herauld
makynge good chere, and was not returned that mornyng that Rouge
Crosse came on hys message, wherefore Rouge Crosse and his tromp
                     •
                  t

no trust of any grounde.
               You haue harde before, howe Ilay the Scottishe Heraulde was returned
for Rouge Crosse, and as sone as Rouge Crosse was returned, he
was discharged, but he taryed with Yorke an Englishe Heraulde makynge
good chere, and was not returned that mornynge that Rouge
Crosse came on hys message, wherefore Rouge Crosse and hys trompet
were detayned by the seruaunte of Ilay, whiche the daye before went
for Rouge Crosse, assurynge them that if Ilay came not home before
none, that he was not liuinge, and then they shoulde haue their heddes
stryken of, then Rouge Crosse offered that hys seruaunt shoulde go for
Ilay, but it would not be excepted, but as hap was Ilay came home
before none, and shewed of his gentell enterteynynge, and then Rouge
Crosse was deliuered, and came to the Englishe armye, and made reporte
as you haue hearde.
               Then the Englishemen remoued their felde on the water of
Tyll, and so forthe ouer many hylles and streytes, marchynge toward
the Scottes on another syde, and in their sight the Scottes burned certayne
poore Uyllages on the othersyde of the Marishe.
               The Englishemen, alwayes leauynge the Scottishe armye on
the left hande, toke their felde vnder a wood syde, called Barmer wood,
two myle from the Scottes, and betwene the two armyes was the Ryuer
of Tyll, &amp; there was a littell hyll that saued the Engliishmen from
the gonneshotte, on whiche hyll the lorde Admyrall perfightly saw and
discouered them all.
               In the euenynge of thesame daye it was concluded betwene the
erle and hys counsayll, and most parte of the armye thereto agreed,
that the Uauntgarde with the ordinaunce shoulde passe ouer agayne
the water of Tyll, at a bridge called Twysel bridge the .ix. day of September,
and the rerewarde to passe ouer at Mylforde, puttinge theym
selfes as nye as they coulde betwene the Scottes and Scotlande, and
so to geue battayll to the Scottes on the hyll, called Floddon hyll.
Frydaye the sayde nynth daye, the lorde Admyrall, lyke a valiaunte
knyghte, passed ouer Twysell bridge with the Uantgarde, marchyng
towarde hys enemyes, lyke diligence was made by the Erle for passynge
ouer at Mylfforde with the rerewarde, saiynge to hys Capytaines,
now good fellowes, do lyke Englishemen this day, take my parte
lyke men, whiche parte is the kynges parte, and I wyste you would
not, I will in my awne person fighte with the kynge of Scottes, rather
to dye honourably by hys crueltye, then to lyue in shame, or that
any reproche shoulde be layed to me hereafter.
               To whome they aunswered, that they woulde serue the kynge and hym
truely that daye. The Englishe armye that daye hadde no vitayle
and were fastynge, and two dayes afore they had onely dronke water,

and coulde s

                  ace get anye other sustenaunce for money, and yet they
kept array on horsebacke from fyue of the clocke in the mornynge tyll
foure of the clocke at after none, and were alwayes in the sighte of the
Scottes.
               The kynge of Scottes perceyuinge the Englishemen, marchinge
towarde Scotlande, thought that they would haue entered into Scotlande,
and burne and fortay the plentifull coūtray, called the Marche,
for so was he made beleue by an Englishemā named Gyles Musgraue
whyche was familiar with the kynge of Scottes, and dyd it for a pollecie
to cause hym to come doune from the hyll: Wherefore the sayde

once. And after that the shotte was done, whiche they defended with
Pauishes, they came to handestrockes, and were encontred seuerally as
you shall here.
               Fyrst on the Englyshe syde next the West, was Syr Edmonde 
Hawarde knyghte, Marshall of the ho

on the ryghte hand of oure vantgarde, and was encountryd with the
Chamberlayne of Scotlande wyth hys battayle of sperys on foote, to
the number of ten thousande at the least, whiche foughte valiauntly,
so that they by force caused the litle wynge to flye, and thesame syr Edmonde
thre tymes felled to the grounde, and left alone, sauynge hys
standarde berar, and twoo of hys seruauntes, too whome came Ihon
Heron bastarde sore hurte, saiynge there was neuer noble mans so
                     •
                  ne
so lyke too be loste as you be thys daye, for all my hurtes▪ I shall
here lyue and dye wyth you, and there thesayde syr Edmonde Hawarde
was in a great daunger and ieopardy of hys lyfe, and hardelye
escaped, and yet as he was goynge to the body of the Uantgard he met
with Dauy Home, and s
                     •
                  ew hym hys awne hande, and so came to the
Uantgard.
               Secondely, Eastwarde from the sayde battayle was the lorde 
Admyrall with the Uantgarde, with whome encountred the erles of
Crafforde and Montroos, accompaigned with many lordes, knyghtes
and gentelmen, all with sperys on foote, but the lorde Admyrall and
hys compaignie acquyted them selfes so well▪ and that with pure fighting,
that they brought to ground a great number, and both the Erles
slayne.
               Thirdely, Eastwarde from the lorde Admyrall was the erle of 
Surrey, Capitayne generall, to whose standarde the kynge of Scottes
in hys awne person marched, beynge accompaigned wyth many
Bishoppes, Erles, Barons, knyghtes and Gentelmen of the Realme,
with a great number of commons, all chosen men with speres on foote,
which were the most assuredlyest harnesed that hath bene sene, and that
the tallest and goodlyest personages with all, and they abode the most
daungerous shot of arrowes, which sore them noyed, and yet except it
hit them in some bare place it dyd them no nurt. After the shotte endyd,
the battayll was cruell, none spared other, and the kynge hym self
fought valiauntly. O what a noble and triumphant courage was
thys for a kyng to fyghte in a battayll as a meane souldier: But what
auayled hys stronge harnes, the puyssaunce of hys myghtye champions
wyth whome he descended the hyll, in whome he soo muche trusted
that with hys stronge people and great number of men, he was able
as he thought to haue vanquished that day the greatest prynce of the
world, if he had ben there as the erle of Surrey was, or els he thought

to do such an hygh enterprice hym selfe in hys person, that should surnount
the enterprises of all other princes: but how soeuer it happened
God gaue the stroke, and he was no more regarded then a poore souldier,
for all went one way. So that of his awne battaill none escaped,
but syr William Scot knight his chauncelour, and syr Ihon forman
knight, his seriaunt Porter, whiche were taken prisoners, and wt great
difficultie saued. This may be a great myrror to all prynces, how that
they aduenter them selfes in such a battail.
               Forthely, Eastward was syr Edward Stanley knight, capitayn of
of the left wyng with the sayde erle, which clame vp to the toppe of the
hyll called Bramston, or the Scottes wiste, and with him encontred the
erles of Huntley, Lēnoux and Argile, with a great number of Scottes
whiche were sore fought with all, whiche perceyuinge the erle of Huntley
toke a horse and saued hym selfe, if he had taryed he had bene likely
to haue go
                     •
                  e with his compaignie: such as fled, the sayde syr Edward
and his people folowed the ouer thesame grounde, where the erles battell
first ioyned, and founde ther the Scottes, whiche were by the erles
battail slayne before, and sodainly left the chase and fell a spoyling, and
spoyled the kyng of Scottes, and many that were slayne in his battail,
but they knew him not, and found a Crosse and certayn thinges of his,
by reason wherof some sayde that he was slayne by that wyng, whiche
could not be true, for the prisoners of Scotlād testified that the kinges
battaill fought onely with the erles battels, but for a truthe this wyng
did very valiauntly: wherfore it was thought that the said syr Edward
might that daye not haue bene missed.
               All these .iiii. battels, in maner fought at one tyme, and were determined
in effect, littell in distance of the beginnyng and endynge of any
of them one before the other, sauyng that syr Edward Stanley, whiche
was the last that fought, for he came vp to the toppe of the hyll, &amp; there
fought with the Scottes valiauntly, and chaced theim doune the hyll
ouer that place, where the kynges battail ioyned. Besyde these .iiii. battayles
of the Scottes were twoo other battayls, whiche neuer came to
hande strokes.
               Thus thorough the power of God on Friday, beyng the .ix. daye of
Septēber, in the yere of our lord .M.D.xiij. was Iames the .iiii. kyng
of Scottes slayn at Bramstone (chiefly by the power of y• erle of Surrey,
lieutenaunt for kyng Henry the, viii. kyng of England, which then
lay at the sege before Tornay) and with the sayde kyng were slayne.

by .iii. houres, (for it was .iiii. of the clock at after none or the battailes
ioyned) or that the Englishmen had had vitayles, so that they myght
haue bidden still together, they had not alonely made the greatest distresse
of Scottes by death and takyng, that the lyke hath not bene sene
in one daye: but also within a litle while might haue put the realme of
Scotland in suche a miserie, &amp; troble, that for euer they should haue ben
ware how to enter the realme of England, and specially the kyng, being
absent: for the Englysh men wanted no good wyll, for of the Scottes
they slew .xii.M. at the lest of the best gentlemen and flower of Scotlād

that ther was no more apperaunce of the Scottes, but all were returned.
Thearle thanked God with humble harte, and called to hym certayne
lordes and other gentlemen and them made knyghtes as syr Edmond
Haward his sonne and the Lorde Scrope, Syr Wylliam Percy
and many other. Then therle and the Lorde Admirall departed to
Barmer wodde and appoyncted Sir Phylippe Tylney knyghte wyth
the compaignye of the lorde Admirall and the compaignye of the Lorde
Scrope of Bolton, the lorde Latymer, olde Sir Marmaduke Constable
Sir Wyllyam Percy, Sir Nycholas Applyard, and their companyes,
and a fewe other to kepe the place where the felde was for sauyng
of the Englyshe ordynaunce, and the ordynaunce that was taken from
the Scottes, whiche was .v. greate Curtalles, twoo greate Culuerynges,
foure Sacres, and syx Serpentynes as fayre ordynaunce as hath
ben sene, bysyde other smalle peces. Well knowen it was by them that
fought, and also reported by the prysoners of Scotlande, that theyr
kynge was take

                  ayne, but hys body was not founde tyll the nexte
daye, bycause all the meane people aswell Scottes as Englyshe were
strypped oute of theyr apparell as they laye on the felde, yet at the
laste he was founde by the Lorde Dacres, who knewe hym well by
hys pryuye tookens in that same place where the battayle of the Erle
of Surrey and hys, fyrste ioyned together.
               Thys kynge had dyuerse deadely woundes and in especiall one with
an Arowe, and an another wyth a byll as apered when he was naked.
After that the bodye of the Kynge of Scottes was fownde
and broughte too Barwycke, the Earle shewed yt too Syr Wyllyam
Scott hys Chaunceller, and Syr Ihon Forman hys seriante
porter, whiche knewe hym at the fyrste sighte and made greate lamentacyon.
Then was the bodye bowelled, embawmed, and cered,
and secretly amongest other stuffe conueyed to Newcastell, but thesame
daye the Lorde Admyrall, came to the felde and ther some Scottes apered
on an hyl: but Wyllyam Blackenall whiche was the cheffe doa

and ruler of all the ordynaunce shott suche a peale, that the Scottes
fledd, or els the Lorde Admyrall had ben in greate ieopardye: and then
all the ordynaunce was broughte in sauetye to the Castell of Cytell,
and there remayned for a tyme. After thys noble vyctorye therle

wrote fyrste to the Quene whiche had raysed a greate power to resiste
the sayde kynge of Scottes, of the wynnynge of the battayle, for then
the bodye of the kynge of Scottes was not fownde, and she yet beynge
at the towne of Buckyngham had woorde the nexte daye after
that the kynge of Scottes was slayne and a parte of hys coate armure
to her sente, for whiche victorye she thanked GOD, and so the
Earle after that the Northe parte was sett in a quietnes, returned to the
Queene with the deade body of the Scottyshe kyng and broughte it to
Richemond.
               Nowe lett vs returne too the kynge of Englande lyenge before
Tournaye whyche the .xxv. daye of September receyued the gauntelett
and letters of the Earle of Surrey, and knewe all the dealynge
of bothe parties. Then he thanked GOD and highly praysed the
Earle and the Lorde Admyrall and his sonne, and all he gentlemen
and commons that were at that valiante entrepryce: Nowebeit, the
kynge had a secrete letter that the Cheshyre men fledde from Syr Edmond
Hawarde, whyche letter caused greate harte burnynge and many
woordes, but the kyng thankefully accepted al thynge, and woulde no
man to be dispraysed. So, on the Mondaye at nyght the .xxvi. daye of
September, the Lorde Harbarte and the Earle of Shrewsburye made
greate fyers in there armyes in token of vyctorye and triumph: and
on Teusdaye the .xxvii. daye, the tente of cloth of gold was sett vp, and

the Byshoppe of Rochester made a Sermond and shewed the deathe of
the kynge of Scottes and muche lamented the yll deathe and periurye
of hym.
               The kynge of Englande lyenge thus before Tournay, caused hys
greate ordynaunce too bee planted rounde aboute the Cytee, and dyuerse
trenches were cast and rampiers made and the Lorde Lysle, and
the Lorde Wyloghby were appoyncted to mayntayne the ordynaunce,
wyth ther bendes, and therle of Kent was lodged before the gate called
port Ualencyen, so that the Cytizens coulde not issue out, nor no
ayde coulde come in. The ordynaunce dayly bett the gates, towers, and
walles, whiche made a greate batterie: and a fewe Englyshmen assaulted
the port coquerell, but they were to few in nomber, and yf they had
ben more in nomber, they had taken the towne as the tournosyns confessed
after. The Cytyzens of Tournay consyderynge their estate,
came together to counsayll, and there the Prouost sayde, frendes

that wee maye fortune to saue bothe lyfe and goodes. Then fynally
all agreed to treate. Then the Prouost sente to the kyng a trompett
desyerynge a saufeconduyte for hym, and certayne other to come and
to speke wyth hym, whyche request was to hym graunted. Then the
Prouost of the cytee accompanyed wyth eleuen wyth hym of the best
of the cytee, came to the armye and spake with the lordes of the counsail
and after were broughte to the kynges presence, the Prouost kneled
downe and all his compaignye and sayde: Ryght highe and myghtye
Prynce although the Cytee of Tournay is stronge, well walled, well
replenyshed wyth people, vytayles, artylerie, ye and the people in
feare and dread of nothynge, yet we knowe that agaynste your greate
puyssaunce yt can not contynue long, although yt were ten tymes as
stronge, as it is, wherefore wee knowynge by reporte, your honoure,
your wysedome, your iustyce, and noble harte, are contente to become
your subiectes and vassalles, so that we maye haue and enioye oure
olde lawes, customes, lyberties, and Franchesses, vnder you as we
haue before thys done vnder other Prynces. Then the kynge aunswered,
we haue well harde your petycyon, we wyll common wyth oure
counsayll and make you aunswere, and when he had communed wyth
his counsayll, he aunswered sayenge: Sirs he that asketh mercye of vs
shall not be denyed, seynge you come to treate, we remytte you to oure
counsayll. Then they wente into the tente of counsayll, and there the
Tournasyns fell at a poyncte, and in conclusion, they yelded the Cytee
and ten thowsande pound sterlynge for the redempcyon of theyr lybertyes,
and so departed to the cytee, makynge relacion of the kynge
and hys noble corage. On Thursdaye the .xxix. daye of September,
the kynge was in hys ryche tente of cloth of golde vnder hys clothe
of estate, to whome came the Cytezens of the Cytee and were sworne
to hym and became his subiectes. Then the kynge appoyncted the lorde
Lysle, the Lorde of Burgayny the Lorde Wylloghby to take possession,
whiche with six thowsand men entered the Cytee and toke the markett
place and the walles, and serched the howses for feare of treason

and then master Thomas Wolsey the kings almoner called before him
all the citizens young and old and sware them to the kyng of England,
the nōber whereof was .iiii. skore thousand. Thus the kyng of England
by conquest came to the possession of the cytee of Tournay: on Sondaie
the .ii. daye of October the kyng entered the cytee of Tournay at porte
Fountayne, and .iiii. of the chiefe of the cytee ouer hym bare a cannapye
with all the armes of England, euery person was in his best apparell, y•
Ladyes and gentlewomen lay in the wyndowes beholdynge the kynge
and his nobilite, euery citizen had in his hande a stafe torche, the kynge
hym selfe was rychely appereilled in ryche armure on a barded courser,
his henxmē beryng his peces of warr, as axe, spere and other, there coursers
were barded with tharmes of England, Fraunce, Ireland, &amp; other
the kynges dominions all of ryche embraudery, thus the kyng with hys
nobilite all richely apparelled with his swerde borne before hym, his herauldes
and seriantes of armes with trumpettes and mynstralsy entered
the cytee and came to our ladye churche, and ther te deum was song.
Then the kyng called to his presence, Edwarde Guldeforde, Wylliam
Fitzwilliam, Ihon Dauncye, William Tiler, I hon Sharpe, William
Huse, Ihon Sauage, Cristopher Garnyshe, and diuerse other valiaunt
esquyers and gaue to them the order of knyghthode, and then went to
his lodgynge, &amp; after none he came to the market place, where was prepared
for hym a place: then he caus

                  s to hym anny amiable countenaunce which was much marked,
the Cry 
                     •
                  myshed, the kyng departed to his campe leuynge the cytee
in saue kepyng. This weke the kyng rode to see the castel of Morton, &amp;
ther his grace toke greate pleasure. The kyng remembrynge the greate
chere that the prynce of castell and the lady Margarete had made hym
at Lysle which was but .xii. mile English from Tornay, desyred thesayd
prynce and lady with diuerse other to come to hym to his cytee of Tornay
and made preparacion for thesame, and appoincted a iustes wherof
he hym selfe woulde be one, and caused a Tilt to be made in the market
place. While these thynges were preparyng, the kyng and his counsaill
ordered for the suer kepyng of the cytee of Tornay, and there ordeyned
Sir Edward Pownynges knyght of the order of the gartier to be hys
Lieutenaunt with .iiii.C. archers, with capytaynes horsemen and artilerie
conuenient, and to haue ayde of Henawde and other the kyngs frindes
adioynyng, and of his garde he left there .iiii.C. archers, &amp; ordinaū
                  ce
was appoyncted for the defence of thesame. Mondaye the .xi. daye of
October the kyng without the towne receyued the prynce of castel, the
lady Margarete and dyuerse other nobles of their countreys and them
brought into Tornay with greate triumphe. The Noys went that the
lord Lysle made request of mariage to the ladye Margarete duches of
Sauoy and doughter to Themperour Maximilian, whiche before that

tyme was departed from the kyng with many riche giftes and money
borowed, but whether he profered mariage or not she fauored him highly:
there the prynce and duches soiorned with great solace by the space

ius
                     •
                  es, the kyng and the lorde Lysle aunswered all commers: vppon the
kyng attended .xxiiii. knyghtes on foote in coates of purple veluet and
clothe of gold. A tent of cloth of gold was sett in the place for the armorie
and releue, the kyng had a base and a trapper of purple veluet bothe
sett full of. S. S. of fyne bulliō and the lord Lisle in thesame suyte, ther
were many speres broken and many a good buffet geuen, the strangers
as the lord Walon and lorde Emery and other dyd right well. When y•
iustes wer done, the kyng and al the other vnhelmed them &amp; rode about
the Tylt and dyd great reuerence to the ladies, and then the herauldes
cryed to lodgyng.
               This night the king made a sumpteous banket of a .C. dishes to the
prince of Castell and the lady Margarete &amp; to all other lordes &amp; ladies,
and after the banket, the ladies daunsed, and then came in the kyng &amp; a
xi. in a maske, all richely appareled wt bonettes of gold, &amp; when they had
passed the time at their pleasure, the garmentes of the maske were cast of
amongest the ladies take who could take.
               The .xx. daye of October, the Prynce of Castell and the lady Margarete
with many great giftes to them geuen returned to Lyle with all
their trayne, After that the kyng was enformed that all direccions were
taken and euery thyng put in an order for the suer kepyng of the citee of
Tornay, he tooke thesame to sir Edward Pownynges knight which valiantly
kept it in good order and iustice.
               The kyng &amp; his counsayll before this had consydered that the Frēchmen
woulde geue them no battayle, &amp; that wynter aproched, which was
no time to ly at siege of other townes, concluded to kepe Tournay sauely,
and to breake vp his campe for that winter, and to begyn agayn war
in the spryng of the yere: this was a full conclusion taken by the kynge
and his counsayl, and so the kynge and all his people (excepte suche as
were appoyncted to be with syr Edward Pownynges) departed out of
Tournay the .xx. daye of September: and the kyng and the noble men
made suche spede, that shortely they came to Caleys, and thyther came
the Lorde Admyrall whome the kynge hartely thanked of his paynes
and there euery man was paied of his wages and conduyte money, and
shippes prepared for the passage, and so the .xxiiii. daye of Septēber the
kyng with a priuy cōpany toke shippe &amp; thesame daye landed at Douer
and shortely after all his people folowed, then he with a small company
rode to Rychemonde in post to the quene, where was suche a louing metyng
that euery creature reioysed. This season began a greate mortalite
in London and other places where muche people dyed: All thys wynter
the kynges nauy kept the sees and robbed and spoyled the Frenchemen
on theyr costes.
               
                  
When the kynge was thus returned he forgatt not the good seruyce
that many a gentleman dyd at the battayle of Bramston, wherefore he
wrote to them his louing letters with such thankes and fauorable wordes
that euery man thought hym selfe well rewarded. And on the daye
of the purificacion of our lady at Lambeth the kynge created the Earle
of Surrey duke of Norffolke with an augmentacion of the armes of
Scotlande, and Sir Charles Brandon Uiconte Lisle, he created duke
of Suffolke, and the Lorde Haward high Admirall he created Earle
of Surrey, and Sir Charles Somersett Lorde Harbert, hys chiefe
Chamberlayne, he created Earle of Worcester: and after that at a nother
daye he made Sir Edwarde Stanley for his good seruice, lorde
Montaygle, and in marche folowyng was master Thomas Wolsey the
kynges almoner consecrate bisshop of Lyncolne, which ther to was named
on Newers daye before: This man was borne at Ypswyche
and was a good Philosopher, very eloquente and full of witte, but
for pryde, couetous, and ambicion, he excelled all other as you shall
here after.
               In the tyme of kynge Henrye the seuenth father to kynge Henrye
the eyght it was concluded betwene the sayde kynge,The discripciō of Thomas Wolsey, whiche afterward was made Cardinall. and kynge Phylyppe
of Castell sonne to Maxymilian Themperour and kynge of Castell
and his wyfe, that Charles hys eldeste sonne shoulde marye the
Lady Mary doughter to the kynge of Englande with a dowrye to her
appoyncted, at whyche tyme they were bothe younge: Nowe at the
kynges retourne from Tournay he made preparacyon too sende thesayde
Ladye hys syster to the Prynce of Castell. But the counsayll of
Flaunders aunswered that concernynge her selfe they woulde gladly
receyue to bee espowsed too there Prynce, for she was then on of the
fayrest Ladyes of the worlde: but as concernynge the articles of her
dowar, they coulde not fulfyll without thassente of the kynge of Arragon
and the realme of Castell (whyche as was sayde, mynded to haue
hym maryed in Spayne.) The kynge lyke a louynge broother
woulde not sende hys syster wyldely wythoute a dowar assured, tooke
the fyrste agremente betwene the kynge her father and kynge Phylyppe
hys father too bee of none effecte, syth the Spanyardes woulde
not conferme the same, and ther cause was, by reason that kynge
Phylyppe was not naturally borne too be there kynge, but was
kynge in the ryghte of his wyfe, and so they were not bounde too hys
agreementes made withoute their consente. So thus the kynge of Englande
reteyned still hys syster and all the preparacion that he had done
for her conueyaunce, whyche was verye costely.
               This season the lady Margarete quene of Scottes late wife to king
Iames the .iiii. slayne at Bramston, and syster to the kyng, wrote to the
kynge to haue compassion of her and his two Nephewes her sonnes,
for she was in feare left he woulde haue inuaded her realme. The kyng
moued with brotherly cōpassion, sent her word, that yf the Scottes kept

peace he woulde kepe peace, yf thei would haue warr he would likewise
haue warr &amp; so with that aunswere the messenger departed. In the sprīg
tyme of the yere the kyng wrote hys letters to all noble men and gentilmen
that he woulde shortely passe agayn into Fraunce in his awne person,
wherfore euery mā prepared him self mete for that iournay: the Flē
                  mynges
heryng therof, made puruiaunce for wagans, vitaile and other
thynges which torned them to great losse for that viage brake of as you
shall here.
               All this season Sir Richard Whethill and syr Ihon Tremayle kept
so Thenglishe pale that the Frenchemen durst not medyl, and yet they
spoyled to base bollen.
               Before this time the townes aboute London as Islyngton, Hoxston,
Shordysh and other, had so enclosed the common feldes with hedges &amp;
diches, that nother the young men of the cytee might shote, nor the auncient
persones might walke for ther pleasure in the feldes, excepte either
ther bowes and arowes were broken or taken a waye, or the honest and
sustanciall persons arrested or indited, saieng that no Londoner should
goo out of the cytee but in the high wayes. This sayeng sore greued the
Londoners, and sodainly this yere a great nomber of the citee assembled
them selfes in a mornynge, and a turnar in a fooles cotte came cryenge
through the cytee, shouels and spades, and so many people folowed that
it was wonder, and within a short space all the hedges aboute the townes
were cast downe, and the diches filled, and euery thinge made playn
the woorkemen were so diligent. The kynges counsayll heryng of this
assembly came to the Gray Frears, and sent for the mayre and the counsayll
of the cytee to knowe the cause, whiche de
                     •
                  lared to them the noysaunce
done to the Citezens, and ther commodytees and liberties taken
from them, though they would not yet the commonaltie and young persons
which were dampnified by the noysaūce would pluck vp &amp; remedy
the same. And when the kynges counsayl had harde the answer, thei dissimuled
the matter, &amp; commaunded the mayer to see that no other thyng
were attempted, and to call home the citezens, which when thei had done
ther entreprice, came home before the kynges counsayll and the Mayer
departed without any more harme doyng, and so after, the feldes were
neuer hedged.
            
            
               ¶The .vi yere.
               
                  IN the moneth of Maye the kynge and the newe Duke of
Suffolke were defenders at the Tilt against al commers,
the kynge was in a scopelary mantel, and hatt of clothe of
syluer and lyke a whyte armite, and the duke appareilled
lyke a black armible all of blacke veluet both ther berdes
were of Damaske syluer, and when they had ridden about the Tylt and
shewed them selfes to the quene, then thei threwe of ther apparell &amp; sent
it to the ladies for a larges, then was the kyng in black, and the Duke

in white with black staues, on the staues was written with white letters
vvho can hold that vvyl avvay: this poyse was iudged to be made for the
duke of Suffolke and the duches of Sauoy, at these iustes were the
duke of Longeuyle and the lord Cleremond, and ther the kyng and the
duke dyd so valiantely that they obteyned the price, at these iustes were
broken .C.xiiii. speres in a short season.
               The kyng at this season sent agayne into Flaunders for the performaunce
of the mariage of the young prynce of castell and the fayre lady
Mary his syster, and shewed how he had prepared all thinges necessary
and conuenient for suche an high estate. The counsayll of Flaunders
aunswered that they woulde not receyue her that yere, with many subtyl
argumentes, by reason wherof the perfite loue betwene England and y•
low countreys was much slaked.
               The .xix. daye of May was receyued into London a Capp of mayntenaunceThe Capp of mayntenaūce▪
                  
and a swerde sent from Pope Iuly, with a great compaignye
of nobles and gentlemen, which was presented to the kyng on the Sonday
then next ensuyng with great solempnytie in the Cathedrall church
of sainct Paul. About this time, the warres yet contynewynge betwene
England and Fraunce, prior Ihon (of whome you haue harde before in
the .iiii. yere) great capitayne of the Frenche nauy, with his Galeys and
Foystes charged with great dasylyskes and other greate artilery came
on the border of Sussex and came a land in the nyght at a poore village
in Sussex called bright Helmston and or the watch coulde him escrye
he sett fyer on the towne and toke suche poore goodes as he, founde: then
the watche fyred the bekyns and people began togather, whiche seynge
prior Ihon Sowned his trompett to call his men aborde, and by that
tyme it was day: then .vi. archers whiche kept the watche folowed prior
Ihon to the sea and shott so fast, that thei bett the galymē from the shore
and prior Ihon hym selfe waded to his foyst, and Thenglishemen went
into the water after, but they were put back with pickes or els they had
entered the foyst, but they shott so fast, that thei woūded many in y• foyst
and prior Ihon was shott in the face with an Arrow, and was likely to
haue dyed, and therfore he offered his image of wax before our lady at
Bolleyn with the Englysh arrow in the face for a myracle.
               When the lorde Admirall of England had hard these newes he was
not contente and sent Sir Ihon Wallopp to the sea incontinente with
diuerse English shippes, whiche sayled to the cost of Normandy &amp; ther
landed and brent .xxi. villages and townes with great slaughter of people,
and brēt shippes and boates in the hauens of Treaport, stapils and
in euery place. This sir Ihon Wallopp quyt hym self so, that men marueled
of his entreprises, consyderyng he had at the most but .viii.C. men
and toke land ther so often.
               In the moneth of Iune the lord Powntremy that was capitayne of
Tyrwyn with banner displayed and great ordinaunce, with a great army
came into Pycardy nere to Arde. Sir Nycholas Uaux capitayne of

Guysnes cōsyderyng that ye Frenchmen had such ordinaunce thought ye
they woulde haue beseged Guysnes, and wrote therof to the kyng which
incontinente prouided a greate armye for the reskewe. And when euery
thyng was redy and the army forward, the lord Pountremy reysed hys
campe and departed without many more doyng, but for al that y• kyng
sent ouer sir Thomas Louell knyght with .vi.C. men to Caleys for the
more strength of that towne and other townes and castelles beyng wt in
the English pale and the marches there.
               The Frenche kyng this yere appoyncted to Richard dela Pole traytor
of England and danyshed the realme .xii.M. lanceknyghtes to kepe
Normandie, and also to entre into England and to conquere thesame,
where they made suche a Ryott that many of them were slayn &amp; he was
fayn to carye them to sente Malos in Britaigne to take shippe: for the
Frenchmen woulde fayne haue bene rydde of them thei cared not how,
there condicions were so vyle and shamefull, but by the reason that the
French kyng suyd for peace, this iornay toke no effect.
               The French kyng by an heraulde wrote to the king of England, that
he marueled greatly why he made hym so sore warr, and brent and toke
his townes, slew and robbed his people with oute any cause geuen on
his parte, wherfore he requyred the kyng to graunt saufconduyte to his
ambassadours, whiche shoulde entreate the cause: whereupon in Iune y•
French king sent a commission with the president of Roan and the generall
boyer and certayne other nobles of Fraunce to entreate peace and
allyaunce betwene bothe the prynces: &amp; farther by cause that thei knewe
that the mariage was broken betwene the prynce of castell and the lady
Mary (as you haue hard) they desyered thesayde lady to be espowsed to
the French kyng, affirmyng a greate dower and suertes for the same, wt
greate treasures: so much was offered that the kyng moued by his coū
                  sayl,
and specially by the Bishop of Lyncolne Wolsey, consented, vpon
condicion that yf thesayde French kyng Loys dyed, then she should if it
pleased her retorne into England agayn with all her dowar and riches:
after suche entretie, the indentures were sealed and the peace proclamed
the .vii. daye of August and the kyng in presence of the French Ambassadours
sworne to kepe thesame, &amp; likewise ther was sente an Ambassadeou
                     •
                  
of England to see the French kyng swere thesame.
               The Dutchmen heryng these newes were sory, and repēted them that
thei receyued not the lady, and spake shamefully of this mariage, that a
feble old &amp; pocky man should mary so fayre a lady, but the voys of people
lett not princes purposes.
               By the conclusion of this peace was the Duke of Longuyle &amp; other
prysoners delyuered, payeng ther Raunson, and thesaid duke affied the
lady Mary in the name of kyng Lewes his mayster. This Duke was
highly interteyned in England of many noble men and had great chere,
but when thei came into Fraunce with the quene he would scace knowe
them. Then when all thinges were redy for the conueyaunce of this noble

Ladye, the kyng her brother in the moneth of September wyth the
quene hys wyfe and hys sayde syster and all the court came to Douer
and there taryed, for the wynde was troblous and the wether fowle, in
so muche that a shipp of th
                     •
                   kynges called the libeck of .ix.C. tonne was
dryuen a shore before Sanga
                     •
                  e and there brast &amp; of .vi.C. men s

                  antely
escaped .iii.C. and yet the most parte of them were hurt with the wrecke.
When the wether was fayre then all her wardrobe, stable, and ryches
was shypped, and suche as were appoyncted to geue their attendaunce
on her, as the duke of Norfolke, the Marques Dorsett, the Bysshop of
Durham, the Earle of Surrey, the lorde Delawar, the lorde Barnes,
the lord Mantaigle, the Marques .iiii. brother, sir Morice Barkeley, sir
Ihon Peche, sir William Sandes, sir Thomas Bulleyn, sir Ihō Cart
and many other knightes▪ Squyers, gētlemen &amp; ladies▪ al these went to
ship and thesayde lady toke her leaue of the quene in the castell of Douer
and the kyng brought her to the sea, syde and killed her and betoke
her to GOD and the fortune of the see, and to the gouernaunce of the
Frenche kyng her husband. Thus the .ii. daye of October at the hower
of foure of the clocke in the morenynge thys fayre ladye tooke her ship
with all her noble compaignie: and when they had 
                     •
                  ayled a quarter of
the see, the wynde rose and seuered some of the shyppes to Caleys, and
some in Flaunders and her shippe with greate difficultie was brought
to Bulleyn, and with great ieopardy at the entryng of the hauen for the
master ran the ship hard on shore, but the botes were redy and receyued
this noble lady▪ and at the landyng Sir Christopher Garnyshe stode in
the water and toke her in his armes, and so caryed her to land, where the
Duke of Uandosme and a Cardynall with many estates receyued her,
and her ladyes, and welcommed all the noble men into that countrey
and so the Quene and all her trayne came to Bulleyn, and ther rested,
and from thense she remoued by dyuerse lodgynges tyll she came all

and when he had sene her beauty (which he so long desyred) and talked
wt her a litle space, then he returned to Abuyle by a secret waye, &amp; she
was wt great triūphe, procession &amp; pagiantes receyued into the toune of

beyng the daye of Saincte Denyse, thesame kynge Lewes maried

the lady Mary in the great church of Abuyle, bothe appareled in goldesmyths
woorke. After the masse was done, ther was a great banket and
fest and the ladyes of Englande hyghly entreteyned.
               The Tewesdaye beyng the .x. daye of October all Thenglishmen
excepte a fewe that were officers with thesayde quene, were discharged
whiche was a greate sorowe for theim, for some had serued her longe in
hope of prefermente, and some that had honest romes lefte them to serue
her, &amp; nowe they were with out seruice, which caused thē to take thought
in so muche some dyed by the way returnyng, and sone fell mad, but ther
was no remedy. After the English lordes had done there commission the
Frēch kyng wylled thē to take no lenger payne, &amp; so gaue to them good
rewardes and they toke ther leaue of the quene and returned. Then
the Dolphyn of Fraunce called lord Frauncys duke of Ualoys, and by
hys wyfe duke of Brytaigne for the more honoure of this mariage, before
Thenglishmen departed from Abuyle, caused a solempne iustes to
be proclaymed which shoulde be kept at Paris in the moneth of Nouē
                  ber
next ensuyng, and that he with his .ix. aydes shoulde aunswere, al
commers beynge gentlemen of name and of armes, Fyrste to ronne .v.
courses at the Tylt with peces of auantage, and also .v. courses at
Randon with sharpe speres, and twelfe strokes with sharpe swordes,
and that done, he and his aydes to 
                     •
                  ight at the barriers with al gentlemen
of name and of armes. Fyrste syx foynes with hand speres, and after
that eyght strokes to the most auantage yf the spere so long held, and
after that twelfe strokes with the swerde, and yf any man be vnhorsed
or be felled wyth fyghtynge on foote, then hys horse and armoure to be
rendered to the officers of armes, and euery man of this chalenge muste
sett vp hys armes and name vpon an arche triumphante, whiche shalbe
made at the place where the iustes shalbe, and farther shall wryte too
what poynct he wyll aunswere to one or to al. When this proclamacion
was reported in Englande by the noble men that returned from the
mariage: the Duke of Suffolke the Marques Dorsett and his foure
brethrene, the Lorde Clynton, Sir Edward Neuel, Sir Gyles Capell,
Thomas Cheney and other sued to the kynge to be at the chalenge, whiche
request, he graciously graunted. Then the Lordes and knyghtes
prepared all thynge necessarye for there entreprice, and shypped there
horses and harnesse, and dyd so muche by iournay, that they came to
Parys, at the ende of the moneth of October, whiche were hartely welcomed
of the kyng and the Dolphyn: but most of all, of the Frēch quene
which then lay at sainct Denyse, and was not yet crowned nor entred in
to Paris.
               The Dolphyn desyred the duke of Suffolke and the lord Marques
Dorsett, whose actiuite he knewe wel by reporte, to be two of his immediat
aides, which therto assented. Therfore was erected an Arche of widnes
at the tournelles besyde the strete on sainct Anthony, directly before
ye Bastel, on the which were sett .iiii. targettes or scutchiōs, the one siluer

and he that sett his name vnder that shylde, runne at the Tylt accordyng
to y• articles: he that put his name vnder the golden target should
ronne with the sharpe speres and fight with sharpe swerdes
                     •
                  : they that
put ther names to the black shilde, should fight a foote with speres and
swerdes for the one hand. And he that touched the tawney sheld shoulde
cast a spere on foot with a targett on his arme, &amp; after to fight with a .ii.
hand swerde: on this arche aboue stode y• armes of the kyng &amp; the quene,
and benethe them stode the armes of the Dolphyn &amp; his aydes, &amp; vndernethe
stode the .iiii. scochions that you haue harde of, and vnder them al
the armes and names of suche as set ther names to any of thesayde .iiii.
scochions. While all these thynges were preparynge, the lady Mary of
England the .v. daye of Nouember then beyng Sondaye, was wt great
solempnitee crowned Quene of Fraunce in the monasterye of Sayncte
Denyce, and the Dolphyn al the season held the croune ouer her hed, because
it was of greate waight to her greuaunce, at whiche coronacyon
were the lordes of England, and accordynge to ther degrees wel enterteyned.
               Mondaye the .vi. daye of Nouember thesayde Quene was receyued
into the cytee of Parys after the order that foloweth. First the garde
of the Cytee met with her with oute Sayncte Denyce all in coates
of goldesmythes woorke with shippes gylt, and after them mett her all
the prestes and relygious whiche were estemed to be .iii.M. The quene
was in a chyre couered about (but not ouer her person) in white cloth of
golde, the horses that drewe it couered in cloth of golde, on her hed a coronall
all of greate perles, her necke and brest full of Iuels, before her
wente a garde of Almaynes after ther fascion, and after them al noblemen,
as the Dolphyn, the Duke of Alanson, the Duke of Burbon, the
Duke of Uandosme, the Duke of Longeuyle, and the Duke of Suffolke,
the Marques Dorsett .v. Cardynalles and a greate nomber of
estates, aboute her person rode the kynges garde whiche were Scottes.
Thus was this quene receyued into Paris and so cōueyed to the cathedral
churche and ther offered, and from thence to the pallayce where she
offered at the holy Chapel, and from thence she went to her lodgyng for
that nyght, for whome was prouided a great supper and the herauldes
cryed a larges and had to them geuen a ship of siluer and gylt, and other
pla
                     •
                  e to the valewe of .ii.C. marke, and after supper began daūsyng and
pastyme. On the morowe begā the iustes, and the Dolphin wt his aydes
entered the feld, the apparell &amp; bardes were cloth of golde cloth of syluer
and crymsyn veluet kanteled together all in one sute, they shewed them
selfs before the kyng &amp; quene who were in a goodly stage, and the quene
stode so that all men might see her and wondered at her beautie, and the
kyng was feble and lay on a couche for weakenes. Then entered y• coū
                  ter
parte by a rayle for combryng the place. These iustes contynued .iii.
dayes, in the whiche were aunswered .iii. hundred and .v. men of armes
and euery man ran .v. courses, and with sharpe speres, dyuerse were

slayne and not spoken of: the English lordes and knyghtes dyd as well
as the best of any the other. At the Randon and Tournay the Duke of
Suffolke hurt a gentleman that he was like to dye, the Marques strok
Mounsire Grew an Albanoys with his spere and per
                     •
                  ed his hed pece &amp;
put hym in ieopardy: the duke of Suffolke in the tornay ouerthrewe a
man of armes horse and man, and so dyd the lorde Marques another,
and yet the Frenchmen woulde in no wyse prayse them. At this tornay
the Dolphyn was hurt in the hande, so that he coulde not performe hys
chalenge at the barriers and put one of his ayde in his rome, the nexte
daye after began the fight at the barriers and because the Dolphin was
not present, the duke of Suffolke and the lorde Marques Dorsett that
daye began the feld, and toke the barriers with speres in hand abydyng
all commers. The Dolphyn brought a mā secretly, which in al the court
of Fraunce was the tallest and the strongest man, &amp; he was an Almayne
and put him in the place of an other person to haue had y• duke of Suffolke
rebuked. The same great Almayne came to the barres fyersly with
face hyd, because he would not be knowne, and bare hys spere to the duke
of Suffolke with all his strength, and the duke him receiued, and for
all his strength put hym by strong strokes from the barriers, and with
the but ende of the spere strake the Almaine that he staggared, but for al
that the Almayne strake strōgly and hardly at the duke, and the iudges
suffered many mo strokes to be foughten then were appoincted, but whē
they saw the Almayne rele &amp; staggar, then they let fall the rayle betwene
them. The lorde Marques Dorsett at thesame time, euen at the same
barre fought with a gentleman of Fraunce that he lost his spere, and in
maner with drewe: When the rayle was let fal, these two noble men put
vp their vysers &amp; toke ayer, &amp; then they tooke swerdes with poynct &amp; edges
abated, and came to the barriers, and y• Almayne foughte sore with
the duke, which imagened that he was a person sett on for the nonce but
y• duke by pure strength tooke hym about the necke, and pomeled so aboute
the hed that the bloud yssued out of hys nose, &amp; then they were departed,
and the Almayne was conueyed by the Dolphyn le
                     •
                  t he should
be knowen. These twoo noble men of Englande that daye fought valiantly
diuerse feates, and the Frenchmen likewise nobly them defended
but it happened the lord Marques one time to put for his aide his yoū
                  gest
brother called the Lorde Edward Grey of the age of .xix. yere, and
to hym was put a gentleman of Fraunce of greate stature and strength
to thentente to plucke hym ouer the barres, but yet the younge Lorde
was of suche strength, powre and pollecy, that he so stroke his aduersarie
that he disarmed hym, al the face bare. Thus was these entrepryces
fynished to the loude of al parties, and Thenglyshmen receyued muche
honoure and no spott of rebuke, yet they were priuely sett at and in many
ieopardies: for the declaracion of this triumphe, he that sawe it can
tell howe goodly the coursers trotted boūded and quickly turned: How
valiantely the men of armes behaued them selfes and howe the Duke

of Burbones bende was apparelled and bassed in tawny veluet, and
clothe of syluer clowdy, the bende of therle of Sayncte Polle apparelled
and barded in purple veluet all to cutt on purple satten, the enfante
of Arragon sonne to Frederycke last kynge of Naples, and hys
bende al in clothe of golde and syluer paled. This lord was but young
but was very towarde. The Duke of Uandosme and his bende in
clothe of golde, and pluncket veluet. The Dolphyn and hys aydes
were euery daye newe apparelled at hys coste, one daye in syluer
and golde, a nother in Crymesyn veluet and yelowe veluet, and another
daye in white veluet and grene, some daye myxted with satyn, some daie
embrawdered, some daye pounced with golde, and so euery daye in
chaunge as the woorkers fantasye coulde deuyse, but the Englishemen
had euer on their apparell red crosses to be knowen for loue of ther coū
                  tre:
at thys triumphe the countie Galeas came into the place on a Ienett
trapped in blewe satten and he hym selfe lykewyse apparelled and
can a corse with a spere, whiche was at the hed .v. ynches on euery syde
square, that is .xx. ynches about, and at the bur .ix. ynches square, that is
xxxvi. ynches, this spere was massy tymber &amp; yet for al that he rā cleane
with it a long course and slightely auoyded it to hys great honour.
               Also ther was another gentleman called Anthony Bownarme which
came into the feld all armed, and on his body brought in sight .x. speres
that is to wyt .iii. speres set in euery styroppe forward, and vnder euery
thygh .ii. speres vpwarde, and vnder his lefte arme was on spere backeward,
and the .x. in his hand, and when he came before the Quene he let
hys horse ronne and neuer stopped tyll he had taken euery spere after
other and broken it on the grounde, and he neuer stopped his horse tyll
all were broken, this gentleman was highely praysed and so he was
worthy: when all this great triumphe was done, the lordes of England
toke ther leue and were highly thanked of the kynge, quene, Dolphyn,
and all the lords, and so departed and came into England before Christmas.
In Nouember the quene was delyuered of a prynce which lyued
not long after.
               This yere in December ther was one Rychard Hun a marchāt tayllor
of London in Lollers tower by the commaundement of the Byshop
of London,Richard Hun cōmitted to y• lowers tower &amp; murthered. called Rychard Fytziames &amp; doctoure Horsey his chaunceler,
whiche was a man more of witt to preferre the Byshoppes iurysdicion
and the clergie, then the truth of the Gospell▪ but so it was that the
sayde Hun was fonnd dead hāgyng by ye neck in a gyrdle of silke, win y•
sayd towre. The begīnyng of this matter must be shewed for y• folowīg
of y• cōsequēt: for this Hū had a chyld yt dyed in his house beyng an infant,
the Curate clamed y• beryng shete for a mortuary. Hun answered y•
the infant had no propertie in the shete, whervpon the priest ascited him
in the spirituall courte, he takynge to hym good counsayll, sued the Curate
in a preminire, and when the prestes hard of this, they dyd so much
of malice that they accused him of heresy, and brought him to the lollers

tower and ther was founde deed as you haue hard.
               This man was counted of honest reputacion, no man to the sight of
people more vertuous, wherfore vpon this matter a greate matter folowed,
for the Byshoppe and his Chaunceller doctour Horsey sayde that
he hanged hym selfe, and all the temporaltie sayde that he was murthered,
and there vpon .xii. men were charged before the Coronour whyche
xii. were elected by greate dyscrecion, and many tymes they were wyth
the kynges counsayll and hard their opynions, but in the meane season
the Bysshop of London brent the dead Carcasse of thesayde Rycharde
Hun in smythfeld, to the abhominacion of the people: but after that the
matter had ben hard by the iudges, and after by the kynges counsayll
his grace beyng present and heryng the cause openly debated and much
borne by the spiritualtie, yet at the last he remitted yt to the tryall of the
lawe▪ and so vpon good euidence doctour Horsey the Chaunceller and
Belrynger with Charles Ioseph the somner, were endyted of the murther:
but afterward by the meanes of the spiritualty &amp; money, Doctour
Horsey caused the kynges attorney to confesse on hys arraynement hym
not to be gylty, and so he escaped and wēt to exetre, and for very shame
durst neuer come after to London. But yet for a further truthe to be declared
in this abhominable and detestable murther here shall folow the
whole inquyry and verdicte of thenquest woorde for woorde.
               The .v. and the .vi. daie of December in the .vi. yere of the reigne of
our souereigne lorde kyng Henry the .viii. Wyllyam Barnewell 
                     •
                  rowner
of London,The inquity of the death of Richard Hun the daye and yere aboue sayde within the warde of Castylbaynerd
of London assembled a quest, whose names afterwarde doo
appere, and hath sworne theim truely to enquire of the death of one Rychard
Hun, whiche lately was founde dead in the Lollers tower with in
Pauls church of London, wherupon al we of the inquest together went
vp into thesayd tower, where we found the body of thesayd Hun hāging
vpon a staple of iron in a gyrdell of sylke, with fayre countenaunce hys
heed fayre kemed, and his bonet right sittyng vpon his heed, wt his ey
                     •
                  n
&amp; mouth fayre closed withoute any staryng, gapyng, or frownyng. Also
without any dreuelyng or spurgyng in any place of his body, wherupō
by one assent all we agreed to take downe the body of thesayde Hun, and
as sone as we begā to heue at the body it was loose, wherby by good aduysement
we perceiued that the gyrdel had no knot aboue the staple, but
it was double cast and the lynkes of an iron chayne which did hang on
the same staple were layd vpon thesame gyrdle wherby he did hang: Also
the knot of the gyrdell that went about his neck stode vnder hys left
eare, which caused his head to leane toward his right shoulder. Not wt
                  standyng
there came out of his nostrels .ii. small stremes of bloud to the
quantite of .iiii. dropes, saue only these .iiii. dropes of blode, the face lippes
chinne, doublet, coler, &amp; shurt of thesayde Hun was cleane from any
bloud. Also we fynd y• the skyn both of his neck &amp; throte beneth the gyrdell
of sylk, was fret &amp; fased awaye, with that thing which ye murtherers

had broken his neck with all. Also she hādes of thesayd Hun were wrōg
in the wristes, wherby we perceyued that his handes had been bounde.
               Moreouer we fynd that within thesayde prison was no meane wherby
any man might hang him selfe, but onely a stole, which stole stode vpon
a bolster of a bed, so tyckle that any man or beast myght not touche
it so litle but it was redy to fall, wherby we perceyued that yt was not
possible that Hun myght hange hym selfe the stole so standynge. Also all
the gyrdell from the staple to hys necke, as well as the part which went
about his neck was to litle for his heed to come out therat. Also it was
not possible that the soft sylken gyrdell shoulde breake his neck or skyn
beneth the gyrdle. Also we finde in a corner somewhat beyonde the place
wher he dyd hang a great persell of bloud. Also we fynde that vpon the
lyfte syde of Huns Iacket from the breast downeward .ii. great stremes
of bloud. Also within the 
                     •
                  lappe of the lyft syde of his Iacket, we fynde
a greate cluster of bloude and the Iacket folden downe therupon, whiche
thyng thesayde Hun coulde neuer folde nor do after he was hanged:
Whereby it appereth plainly to vs all, that the necke of Hun was broken,
and the greate plenty of blude was shed before he was hanged.
Wherefore all wee fynde by God and all our consciences that Rychard
Hun was murthered: also we acquyte thesayd Richard Hun of his aune
deathe.
               Also an ende of a wax candell whyche as Ihon Belrynger sayeth,
he lefte in the pryson burnyng with Hun that same Sondaye at nyght
that Hun was murthered, whyche waxe candell we founde styckynge
vppon the stockes fayre put oute, aboute seuen or eyght foot from the
place where Hun was hanged, whyche candell after oure opynion was
neuer put oute by hym, for many lykelyhodes whiche we haue perceyued.
Also at the goynge vp of Master Chaunceller into the Lollars
tower, wee haue good proofe that there laye on the stockes a gowne eyther
of murrey or crimosyn in grayn furred with shankes, whose goune
yt was wee coulde neuer proue, neyther who bare yt awaye. All wee
fynde that Master Wyllyam Horsey Chaunceller to my lorde of London
hath had at hys commaundement bothe the rule and guydynge of
thesayde prysoner. Moreouer, all we fynde that thesayde Master Norsey
Chaunceller hath put Charles Ioseph out of his office, as thesayde
Charles hath confessed, because he would not dele and vse thesayde prysoner
so cruelly and do to hym as the Chaunceller would haue had hym
to do. Notwithstandyng the keyes delyueraunce to the Chaunceller by
Charles on the Saturdaye at nyght before Huns deathe and Charles
rydyng out of the towne on the Sondaye in the mornyng ensuyng was
but a conuencion made betwixte Charles and the Chaunceller, for to colour
the murther, for thesame Sōday that Charles rode furth, he came
agayne to towne the Sonday at nyght, and kylled Rychard Hun▪ as in
the deposycions of Iulian Littell, Thomas Chitcheley, Thomas Symondes,
and Peter Tur
                     •
                  er doeth appere.
               
                  
After colouryng of the murther betwixte Charles and the Chaunceller
conspired, the Chaunceller called to hym one Ihon Spaldyng Belrynger
of Poules and delyuered to thesame Belrynger the keyes of the
Lollars towre, geuyng to thesayde Belrynger a great charge, sayeng:
I charge the to kepe Hun more straytely than he hath been kepte, and
let hym haue but one meale a daye. Moreouer I charge the, let no body
come to hym wythoute my lycence, neyther to brynge hym shurt, cap,
kercheffe, or any other thynge, but that I see it before yt come to hym.
Also before Hun was caried to Fulham, the Chaunceller commaunded
too bee put vppon Huns necke a greate coller of Iron with a greate
chayne whiche is to heuy for any man or beast to were and longe to endure.
               Moreouer it is well proued that before Huns death thesayd Chaunceller
came vp into thesayde Lollers tower, and kneled downe before
Hun, holdyng vp hys handes to hym, prayenge hym of forgeuenesse of
all that he had done to hym and muste do to hym. And on the Sondaye
folowynge the Chaunceller commaunded the Penytensary of Poules,
too goo vp to hym and saye a Gospell, and make for hym holy water
and holye breade, and geue yt to hym, whyche so dyd and also the
Ch
                     •
                  unceller cōmaunded that Hun should haue his diner. And thesame
dyner tyme Charles boye was shute in pryson with Hun, whiche was
neuer so before, and after dyner whan the Belrynger fet oute the doye,
the Belrynger sayde to thesame boye, come no more hyther with mete
for hym vntyll to morowe at noone, for my mayster Chaunceller hathe
commaunded that he shall haue but one meale a daye: and thesame
night 
                     •
                  olowynge Rychard Hun was murthered, whiche murder coulde
not haue been done wythoute consente and lycence of the Chaunceller,
and also by the wittynge and knowelege of Ihon Spaldynge Belrynger,
for there coulde no man come in to the prysone but by the keyes beyng
in Ihon Belryngers kepynge. Also as by my Lorde of Londons
booke doeth appere, Ihon Belrynger is a poore innocente man, wherefore
all wee doo perceyue that thys murther coulde not be done, but by
the commaundement of the Chaunceller, and by the wittyng &amp; knowing
of Ihon Belrynger.
               Charles Ioseph wythin the tower of London of hys awne free
wyll and vnconstreyned sayde, that Master Chaunceller deuysed and
wrote with his awne hand, all suche heresyes as were layd to Hūs charge,
recorde Ihon God, Ihon Truy, Ihon Pasmar, Richard Gybson wt
many other.
               Also Charles Ioseph sayeth, that whan Rychard Hun was slayne
Ihon Belrynger bare vpp the steyre into Lollars tower a waxe candell,
hauynge the keyes of the dores hangynge on hys arme, and I
Charles went nexte to hym, and master Chaunceller came vp last, and
whan all wee came vp, we founde Hun lyenge on hys bedde, and than
Mayster Chaunceller sayde, lay handes on the thefe and so all we murthered

Hun, and than I Charles put the gyrdell aboute Huns necke,
and than Ihon Belrynger and I Charles dyd heue vp Hun and Master
Chaunceller pulled the gyrdell ouer the staple, and so Hun was
hanged.

of Rychard Hun, that Charles Ioseph her master came home to hys
supper: than Iulian sayde to hym, master yt was tolde me that ye were

supper Charles trussed persell of his goodes, and with helpe of Iulyan
bare them into Master Porters howse to kepe, and that done Charles
sayde to Iulian. Iulian, yf thou wilt be sworne to kepe my counsayll
I wyll shewe the my mynde. Iulian aunswered ye, yf it be neyther felonie
or treason: than Charles toke a boke oute of his purse, and Iulian
sware to hym therupon, than sayde Charles to Iulian, I haue distroyed
Rycharde Hun. Alas Master sayde Iulian, howe he was called
an honest man? Charles aunswered, I put a wyre in his nose. Alas
sayde Iulyan nowe be ye cast a waye and vndone, than sayde Charles
Iulyan I truste in the that thou wylt kepe my counsayll, and Iulyan
aunswered ye, but for Godes sake master shifte for your selfe, and than
Charles sayde I had leuer than hundred pound yt were not done, but
that is done can not be vndone▪ Moreouer Charles sayde than to Iulyan,
vpon Sondaye whan I rode to my cousyn Baryngtons house▪ I
taryed there and made good chere all daye tyll yt was nyght, and yet

This straunge apparell pleased muche euery person, and in especial the

chamber with great light of torches, and daunsed a greate season, and
then put of their visers, &amp; then they were well knowen, and the Quene
hartelye thanked the kynges grace for her goodly pastyme, and kyssed
hym.
               Likewise on the twelfe night, the kyng and the Quene came into
the hall of Grenewyche, and sodainlye entered a tent of clothe of golde
and before the tent stode .iiii. men of armes, armed at all poinctes and
swerdes in their handes, and sodainly with noyes of trompettes entered

tyme: when they had daunsed their pleasure▪ they entered the tent again
and so was conueyed out of y• hal, &amp; then the kynge and the quene were
serued with a right sumpteous banquet.
               The .iii. daye of Februarie, the kynge made a solempne Iustes, &amp;
he and the Marques Dorset would aunswer all commers, their apparell
&amp; bardes were of blewe veluet, and clothe of siluer, all too cutte in

The kynge was that daye highly to be praysed, for he brake .xxiii.

hys horse: the lorde Marques and all other dyd valiauntly, and hadde

muche prayse▪ for euery man did passinge well, which is seldome sene in
suche a case, but the kynge for a suertie exceded all other.
               The .iiii. daye of October, the kynge remoued to Lambeth, and on
the morow beganne the hygh courte of Parliamēt, syr Thomas Neuel
was then speaker, in this Parliament was diuerse actes made, but in

and the other the acte of laborers, of these .ii. actes was muche cō
                  monynge
and muche busynes arose, for the laborers woulde in no wyse
labour by the daye, but all by taske and in grette, and therefore muche
trouble fell in the courte, and in especial in Haruest tyme, for then husbande
men coulde scace get workemen to helpe in their Haruest. Thys
Parliament contynued tyl Easter, in the which dyuerse subsidies were
graunted to the kynge towarde hys greate costes and charges, that
he had bene at in hys vyage Royall in Fraunce, and after Easter the
xix. daye of the moneth of Aprill, the kynge delitynge to set forth yoūge
Gentelmen, called Nycholas Carew, and Fraunces Bryan, and caused
dyuerse other younge Gentelmen, to be on the counter parte, and

The kyng then gaue thesayd Archebishoprike to Thomas Wolsey,
then bishop of Lyncoln, which at that tyme bare all the rule aboute
y• kyng, &amp; what he sayd was obeyed in all places. And whē he was once

kyng &amp; the Frenche kyng to wryte to Rome for him, &amp; at their requestes
he obteyned his purpose as you shall here afterwarde.
               At this tyme was much cōmoning, &amp; verely as it appered it was entended,
that the kyng in person woulde passe the sea to Caleys, &amp; there

               And after he sent a letter to comfort the Quene his sister, requyrynge
too knowe her pleasure whither she woulde continue still in Fraunce
or returne into Englande agayne. And when he was aduertised of her
purpose, which was to retorne into England. He sent the duke of Suffolke,

to the apointmentes assigned her a dower, &amp; the duke of Suffolke put
in officers, and then she was by endenture deliuered to the duke, which
behaued him selfe so to her, that he obteyned her good wil to be her husbande,
&amp; therupon he wrote to the kyng her brother, mekely besechynge
hym of pardon of his request &amp; hūblye requyringe hym of hys wil &amp; cō
                  sent,
at which thynge the kyng a while staied, and at the last by y• meane
of the Frenche quene her selfe, &amp; other great frendes on the dukes parte,
After lōg suyte it was agreed that y• duke of Suffolke should bring her
into England vnmaryed, &amp; at hys retorne to mary her in England: but
for doubte of chaunge he maryed her secretely in Parys as was sayde.

quene with her dower apoynted, &amp; all her apparell, iuels
and housholde stuffe deliuered, he with y• quene toke their
leaue of the Frēche kyng, leauing doctor West, nominate
bishop of Ely, for the conclusion of the newe league to be
made betwene the kyng of Englande, &amp; the newe Frenche kynge called
Fraunces the first, and so passed thorough Fraunce to Caleys, where
she was honorably enterteined. And after with great honour maried to
lord Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolke opēly: howbeit, some sayd he
was maryed priuely before at Parys, in the house of Cluigny. Against
this mariage many men grudged &amp; sayd that it was a great losse to the
realme that she was not maryed to the prynce of Castell: but the wisest
sorte was cōtēt, cōsideryng that if she had ben maryed agayn out of the
realm, she should haue caried much riches with her, &amp; now she brought
euery yere into the realme .ix. or .x.M. markes: but whatsoeuer the rude
people said, ye duke behaued him selfe so, that he had both the fauour of
the kyng and of the people, hys wytte and demeanour was suche.
               The king &amp; the quene accōpanyed with many lordes &amp; ladyes roade
to the high ground of shoters hil to take the open ayre, and as thei passed
by the waye, they espied a cōpany of tall yomen, clothed all in grene

of them, which called him selfe Robyn hood, came to the kyng, desyring
him to se his men shoote, &amp; the kyng was cōtent. Then he whisteled, &amp; al
the .ii.C. archers shot &amp; losed at once, &amp; then he whisteled agayne, &amp; they
likewyse shot agayne, their arrowes whisteled by crafte of the head, so
that the noyes was straunge and great, &amp; muche pleased the kynge the

triumphe as though the greatest prince of Christendō had bene come
into the realme. And on a Sonday at s. Peters church at Westmynster
he receaued the habite, hat, and piller, and other vaynglorious tryfles,
apperteygnyng to the ordre of a Cardinall. And when he was once a
perfite Cardinal, he loked then aboue all estates, so that all mē almost
hated hym, and disdayned hym.
               Then after the Parliamēt syr Edward pouninges laboured to be discharged
of ye keping of the citie of Torney, for there he was euer sickly,
and so he was discharged, &amp; syr Williā blunt lorde Moūtioye was sent
thether. And for Marshal there was apoynted syr Sāpson Nortō. And
when the lord Mountioye was come thether, &amp; syr Sampson Norton,
there happened such a ryot that the citie was in great ieopardy, ye very
cause was vnknowen, but all the souldiours, except such as were of the
kynges garde rebelled, &amp; put the lord Moūtioye in ieopardy of his life.
And in cōclusion to appease the people, syr Sāpson Nortō was banisshed
the toune for euer. And after the citie was appeased, &amp; euery thing
thought to be forgottē, diuerse were executed, &amp; diuerse banished y• toun
and some fled &amp; were banyshed bothe England and the toune.
               After the Parliamēt was ended, the kyng kept a solēpne Christmas
at his maner of Elthā, &amp; on the .xii. night in the hal was made a goodly
castel, wōderously set out, &amp; in it certeyn ladyes &amp; knyghtes, &amp; when the
kyng &amp; quene were set, in came other knightes, &amp; assailed the castel wher
many a good strype was geuen, &amp; at the last, the assaylantes were beatē
awaye. And then issued out knightes and ladies out of the castel, which
ladyes were ryche &amp; straungely disguysed, for all theyr apparel was in
braydes of gold, fret with mouing spangels, syluer and gilt, set on Crymosyn

satten lose and not fastened: the mens apparell of thesame suyte
made lyke Iulys of Hungary, and the ladyes heddes &amp; bodyes were
after the fassion of Amsterdam. And when the daunsing was done▪ the
banquet was serued in of .ii.C. dyshes, with great plēty to euery body.
               This yere was the new league betwene the kyng &amp; the French kyng
openly Proclaymed thorough the cytie of London with a trōpet. This
yere also, Margaret quene of the Scottes, wife to Iames the .iiii. slain
at Bramston the .v. yere of the kyng, &amp; elder syster to the kyng, after the
death of her late husband maried Archibald Douglas erle of Angus,
without the kyng her brothers assent, or the coūsail of Scotlād, for the
whiche he was not wel cōtent. But after that, there fell such a stryfe betwene
the lordes of Scotlād, that she &amp; her husband lyke banished persones
came into England, &amp; wrote to the kyng for mercy &amp; cōfort. The
kyng euer enclyned to mercy, sent theim apparell, vessell &amp; all thynges
necessary, willyng them to lye still in Northumberland, till they knewe
farther of his pleasure: And so they laye still at Harbotell, &amp; the quene
was there deliuered of a fayre lady called Margaret, and all the countrey
were commaunded by the kyng to do them pleasour.
               This yere the .xviii. of February, at Grenewyche was borne a fayre
prynces and christened with great solempnitie, and named Mary.
               This yere dyed the kyng of Arragon father to the quene, for whome
was kept a solempne obsequy in the Cathedral churche of Paules.
            
            
               ¶The .viii. yere.
               
                  YE haue harde the laste yere how the quene of Scottes wt
her husband was come for succour into Englād, &amp; laye at
Harbottell in Northumberland, tyll the kynges pleasure
was to send for thē. So he, lyke a natural brother sent for
her &amp; her husbande to come to his courte for their solace.
For the which kyndnes the erle Hūbly thanked the kyng, &amp; promised to
geue his attendaūce on the quene hys wyfe to the Courte: wherupō the
kyng sent William blacknall esquyer, clerck of hys Spycery with siluer
vessell, plate and other thynges necessary for the conueyaūce of her,
and sent to her all maner of officiers for her estate cōuenyent. And whē
she was ready to departe, she asked for her husband, but he was departed
into Scotland, &amp; left her alone, no thing remembringe his promes,
which sodeyn departyng muche made her to muse: Howbeit, the lordes
of England greatly encoraged her to kepe her promyse with the kynge
her brother: &amp; so after she was somewhat appeased▪ she set forward, &amp; in
euery toune she was wel receaued, &amp; so on the .iii. day of May she made
her entry into Lōdō, riding on a white palfreye (which ye quene of England
had sent to her) behynde syr Thomas par richely besene, &amp; wt great
cōpany of lordes &amp; ladyes, she roade thoroughe the citie to Baynardes
Castel, &amp; frō thence she was cōueyghed to Grenewiche, &amp; there receaued
ioyously of the kyng, the quene, the Frēche quene her syster, and highly

was she feasted. And when the kyng hearde that the erle of Angus her
husband was departed, he sayd, it was done lyke a Scot. This quene
sometyme was at the courte, and sometyme at Baynardes castel, and so
she contynued in Englande all this yere.
               The kynge for the honour of his syster, the .xix. &amp; .xx. daye of Maye
prepared .ii. solēpne dayes of Iustes, &amp; the kynge hym selfe, &amp; the duke
of Suffolke

                   the erle of Essex, &amp; Nicholas Carew esquyer, toke on them
to aunswer all cōmers. The apparell of thē &amp; their horses was blacke

                  yne flat gold

was very cōning &amp; sumpteous. On the kyng was attēding in one

                  y, the lord Hastinges, syr Ihon pechy, ye lord Ferreys, syr William

veluet, 
                     •
                  rynged with golde: And on foote were .xl. persons all in blewe
sattyn, garded with clothe of golde. And so they entered the felde wyth

                  relsey.
               Then in came the coūtreparte, richely appareled, to the nūber of .xii.
&amp; on that daye euery mā did wel, but the kyng did best, &amp; so was adiudged,
and so at night they ceassed, and came to supper.
               The kyng, the next day &amp; his cōpany were appareyled horse &amp; all in
purple veluet, set ful of leaues of cloth of gold, engrayled with fyne flat
gold of dāmaske, embroudered like to Rose leues, &amp; euery lefe fastened
to other with pointes of dāmaske gold, &amp; on all their borders were letters
of gold, bullion. And on the kyng wayted .v. lordes .xiiii. knightes
in frockes of yelow veluet, garded &amp; boūde with riche clothe of golde, &amp;
xxx. gentelmē were in like apparel on fote, &amp; .xl. officiers in yelow satyn

                     •
                  dged with cloth of gold: Thus with great triūphe they entred ye felde.
Then the coūtrepartie entred, al clothed &amp; barded in white sattyn, trauersed
wt cloth of gold richely. This dai was many a great stripe geuē.
The kyng &amp; syr Williā kyngstō rāne together, which syr Williā was a
strōg &amp; a tall knight, &amp; yet ye king by strēgth ouerthrew him to ye groūd.
And after that ye king &amp; his aides had performed their courses, thei rāne
volāt at al cōmers, which was a pleasaūt sight to se. And whē night approched,
they all disarmed thē, and wēt to the quenes chāber, where was
a great banket for the welcome of the quene of Scottes.
               Thys moneth of May were sent out of England .xii.C. masons and
Carpenters, &amp; .iii.C. laborers to the citie of Torney: for the kyng &amp; his
coūsail, cōsidering y• the garrison that was kept there, was chargeable,
&amp; therfore it was determined that there shoulde be buylded a Castel to
chastice the citie if they rebelled, and to minyshe the garrison. And therfore
these workemen were sent thether, whiche this yere began a strong
Castell, and wrought still on it.
               This yere, by the Cardinall, were all men called to accompt that

had the occupiyng of the kynges money in the warres or els where, not
to euery mans contentacion, for some were 
                     •
                  ound in arrerages, &amp; some
saued them selfes by pollecy &amp; brybory, and waxed ryche, and some Innocentes
were punyshed. And for a truthe he so punyshed periurye with
open punyshment &amp; open papers werynge, that in his tyme it was lesse
vsed. He punyshed also lordes, knyghtes, and men of all sortes for ryottes,
beryng and mayntenaunce in their countreyes, that the poore mē
lyued quyetly, so that no man durst beare for feare of imprisonement:
but he hym selfe and his seruaūtes, which were well punyshed therfore.
The poore people perceaued that he punished the ryche, then they complayned
without number, and brought many an honest man to trouble
and vexacion. And when the Cardinall at the last had perceaued theyr
vntrue surmyses &amp; fayned cōplaintes for the most parte, he then wexed
wery of heryng their causes, &amp; ordeyned by the kynges cōmissiō, diuerse
vnder courtes to here cōplaintes by byll of poore people. The one was
kept in the white hall, the other before the kynges Almoner doctor Stokes
                     •
                  ey,
a mā y• had more learning, then discreciō to be a iudge. The third
was kept in lord treasourers chāber besyde the starre chāber, &amp; y• .iiii
at the rolles at after noone. These courtes were greatly haunted for a
tyme, but at y• last y• people perceaued y• muche delay was vsed in these
courtes, &amp; few matters ended, &amp; when they were ended, they boūd no mā
by the law, then euery mā was wery of thē &amp; resorted to the cōmō lawe.
               In the moneth of October came into England Mathew bishop of
Sedonō &amp; Cardinal, called cōmonly the Cardinal of Swyshes, frō the
Emperour Maximiliā. This Cardinal was a wise mā &amp; of great boldenes,
&amp; was wel entreteyned in the courte &amp; of ye king. And at his cōtēplacion
&amp; for olde loue, ye king lēt to ye Emperour Maximiliā a great sūme
of money: wherof ye cōpany of Friscobalde, &amp; Antony Caueler Geneuoy
vndertoke thexchāge, but thei payed not ye Emperour at his day, not wt
                  stāding
thei had receaued ye money of ye king. This Friscobald &amp; Anthony
Caueler by meanes of rewardes, geuē to great lordes of the coūsaill
borowed of y• king .xxx.M.
                     •
                  . &amp; had lōg dayes for the paymēt: but Friscobald
was shortely cōsumed, &amp; Anthony Caueler coulde not be sene, &amp;
so y• kīg was not payd at his dayes, &amp; many English merchaūtes were
by these mē vndone, for they spent liberally of euery mans goodes.
               This yere the king kept his Christmas at his maner of Grenewiche,
&amp; on the .xii. night, according to the old custome, he &amp; the quene came into
the hall, &amp; when they were set, &amp; the quene of Scottes also, there entred
into the hall a Gardeyn artificial, called the Gardeyn of Esperāce.
This Gardeyn was towred at euery corner, &amp; rayled wt rayles gilt, al y•
bākes were set wt floures artificial of silke &amp; golde, y• leues cut of grene
sattyn, so y• they semed very floures. In y• middest of this Gardeyn was
a piller of antique worke, al golde set wt perle &amp; stone, &amp; on the toppe of
the piller, which was .vi. square, was a louer or an arche embowed, crouned
with golde: within which stoode a bushe of Roses red &amp; white, all of

sylke and golde
                     •
                   &amp; a bushe of Pomegranates of lyke stuf. In this gardey
                     •
                  
walked .vi. knyghtes and .vi. ladyes richely appareyled, and then
they discended and daunsed many goodly daunses, &amp; so ascended ye gardeyn
agayn and were conueighed oute of the hall, and then the kynge
was serued of a great banket. After this Christmas, the kyng exercised
him self muche in hawkynge.
               In this ceason, the Genowayes, Frenchemen and other straungiers
say
                     •
                  e and boasted them selfes to be in suche fauour with the kyng and
hys counsayll, that they set naughte by the rulers of the citie: and the
multitude of 
                     ••
                  raungers was so great aboute London, that the poore
Englishe artificers coulde skace get any lyuynge: And moost of all
the straungers were so proude, that they dis
                     •
                  ayned, mocked and oppressed
the Englishemen, whiche was the beginnynge of the grudge. For
amonge all other thynges, there was a Carpenter in London called
Willyan
                     •
                   son, whiche bought two stockdoues in Chepe, and as he was
abou
                     •
                  e to paye for them, a Frencheman tooke them oute of hys hande,
and sayde they were not meate for a carpenter: well sayde the Englishman
I haue bought them and now payd for them, and therefore I will
haue them, naye sayde the Frencheman I will haue theim for my lorde
the Ambassador, and so for better or worse, the Frencheman called the
Englisheman knaue, and went awaye with the stockdoues. The
straungiers came to the Frenche Ambassadour, &amp; surmysed a cōplaynt
agaynste the poore carpenter, and the Ambassadour came to my lorde
Mayre, and sayde so muche, that the carpenter was sent to pryson: and
yet not contented with this, so complayned to the kynges counsail, that
the kynges commaund ement was layde on hym. And when syr Ihon
Baker knyght and other worshipfull persones sued too the Ambassadour
for hym,The pr
                        •
                     de of Frenchem
                        •
                     n, he aūswered, by the body of God that the English knaue
shoulde lose his lyfe, for he sayde no Englisheman shoulde deny that
the Frenchemen required, and other aunswer had they none.
               Also a Frencheman that had slayne a man, should abiure the realme
&amp; had a crosse in his hande, &amp; then sodeinly came a great sorte of Frēchmen
aboute him, &amp; one of them sayde to the Constable that led hym, syr
is this crosse the price to kyll an Englishman. The Cōstable was somwhat
astonyed and aunswered not. Then sayde another Frencheman,
on that pryce we woulde be banyshed all by the masse, thys saiyng was
noted to be spoken spitefully. Howebeit, the Frenchemen were not alonely
oppressors of the Englishmen, for a Lombarde called Fraunces
de bard, entised a mannes wyfe in Lombarde strete to come to his chā
                  bre
with her husbandes plate, whiche thynge she dyd. After when her
husbande knewe it, he demaunded hys wyfe, but aunswer was made he
shoulde not haue her, then he demaunded his plate, and in lyke maner
aunswer was made that he shoulde neither haue plate nor wyfe. And
whē he had sewed an accion agaynste the straunger in the Guylde hall,
the straunger so faced the Englisheman, that he faynted in hys sute.
               
                  And then the Lombarde arrested the poore man for his wyfes boorde,
while he kept her frō her husbād in his chāber. This mocke was much
noted, and for these and many other oppressions done by them, there encreased
suche a malice in the Englishe mennes hartes, that at the laste
it brast oute. For amongest other that sore grudged at these matters,
there was a broker in London called Ihon Lyncoln, whiche wrote a
bill before Easter, desyring doctor Standyche at hys sermon at sainct
Marye Spyttell the Mondaye in Easter weke, too moue the Mayre
and Aldermen, to take parte with the comminaltie agaynst the straungiers:
The doctor aunswered that it became not hym too moue anye
suche thynge in a sermon. From hym he departed, and came to a Chanon
in sayncte Mary spittell, a doctor in Deuinitie, called doctor Bele,
and lamentably declared to hym, howe miserably the common artificers
lyued, and skase coulde get any woorke to fynde them, their wyfes
and chyldren, for there were such a nūber of artificers straungers, that
tooke awaye all the lyuynge in maner. And also howe the Englishe
merchauntes coulde haue no vtteraunce, for the merchaunt s
                     •
                  raungers
brynge in all Sylkes, clothe of Golde, Wyne, Oyle, Iron and suche
other merchaundise, that no man almoost byeth of an Englisheman.
               And also outwarde, they carye so muche Englishe Wolle, Tynne, and
Leade, that Englishmen that auenture outwarde can haue no lyuyng:
Whiche thynges sayd Lyncoln hathe bene shewed to the counsayll▪ &amp;
cannot be heard. And farther sayde he, the straungiers compasse the
cytye rounde aboute, in Southwarke, in Westmynster, Temple barre,
Holborne, Sayncte Martynes, Sayncte Ihons
                     •
                   strete, Algate, Towre
hyll, and sayncte Katherynes, and forstall the market▪ so that no good
thynge for them commeth to the market: whiche is the cause that Englishemen
want and sterue, and thei lyue haboundantly in great pleasoure.
Wherefore sayde Lyncolne master doctor, syth you were borne in
Lōdon, &amp; se the oppression of the straūgers, &amp; the great misery of your
awne natyue countray, exhorte all the cytiezens to ioyne in one agaynst
these straungers, raueners and destroyers of your countrey. Master
doctor hearynge thys, sayde he muche lamented the case if it were as
Lyncoln hadde declared, yes sayde Lyncolne, that it is and muche
more, for the Dutchemē bryng ouer Iron, Tymber, lether and Weynskot
ready wrought, as Nayles, Lockes, Baskettes, Cupbordes, Stooles,
Tables, Ches
                     •
                  es, gy
                     •
                  dels, with poyntes, sadel
                     •
                  es &amp; painted clothes
so that if it were wrought here, Englishmen might haue some worke &amp;
lyuynge by it. And besyde this, they growe into such a multitude that it
is to be looked vpon, for I sawe on a Sondaye this Lent .vi.C. straū
                  giers
shotyng at y• Popyngaye with Crosoowes, and they kepe such assemblyes
and fraternities together, &amp; make such a gathering to their cō
                  mon
boxe, that euery botcher will holde plee with the citye of Lōdō: wel
sayd the doctor, I will do for a reformacion of this matter asmuche as
a priest may do, &amp; so receaued Lincolnes byl &amp; studyed for his purpose.

Then Lyncoln very ioyous of hys enterprice went from man to man,
saiyng that shortly they shoulde heare newes, and daily excited younge
people and artificers to beare malice to the s
                     •
                  raungiers. When Ester
came and doctor Bele should preache the Twesdaye in Ester weke, he
came into the pulpit, and there declared that to him was brought a pitiful
bill, and red it in thys wyse. To al you the worshipful lordes and
masters of this citie, that wil take cōpassion ouer the poore people your
neyghbours, and also of the great importable hurtes, losses, and hynderaunces,
whereof procedeth the extreme pouertie too all the kynges
subiectes that inhabite within this citie and suburbes of thesame, for
so it is that the alyens and straūgiers eate the bread from the poore fatherles
chyldren, and take the liuynge from all the artificers, and the
entercourse from all merchauntes, wherby pouertie is so muche encreased
that euery man bewaileth the misery of other, for craftes mē be brought
to beggery and merchauntes to nedynes: wherefore the premisses
considred, the redresse must be of the commons, knyt and vnyte to one
parte, and as the hurt and dammage greueth all men, so muste all men
set to their willyng power for remedy, and not to suffre thesayd alyens
so highly in their wealth, and the naturall borne men of his region too
come to confusion. Of this letter was more, but the doctor red no farther,
and then he began Coelum coeli domino, terram autem dedit fil
                        •
                     s hominum,
and vpon thys text he intreated, that this lande was geuen too
Englishemen, and as byrdes woulde defende their nest, so oughte Englishemen
to cheryshe and defende them selfes, and to hurte and greue
aliens for the common weale. And vpon this text pugna pro patria, he
brought in, howe by Goddes lawe it was lawfull to fight for their coū
                  trey,
and euer he subtellye moued the people to rebell agaynst the straū
                  giers,
and breake the kynges peace, nothynge regardynge the league
betwene princes and the kynges honoure. Of this Sermon many a
light person tooke courage, and openly spake against straungiers.
               And as the deuell woulde, the Sundaye after at Grenewiche in y• kynges
gallery was Fraunces de bard, whiche as you harde kept an Englishe
mans wyfe and his goodes, and yet he coulde haue no remedy, &amp;
with him were Domyngo, Anthony Caueler, and many mo straūgers,
and ther they talkynge with syr Thomas Palmer knyght, Iested and
laughed howe that Fraunces kepte the Englishemans wyfe, saiynge y•
if they had the Mayres wife of London, they woulde kepe her: syr Thomas
sayd, Sirs you haue to muche fauour in Englande. There were
diuerse Englishe merchauntes by, and harde them laugh and were not
content, in somuche as one William bolt a Marcer sayd, wel you who

affirmed. This tale was reported aboute London, and the

the merchaunt straungiers, as well as on the artificers straungiers.
               
                  
On Monday the morow after, the kyng remoued to hys maner of Rychemonde.
            
            
               ¶The .ix. yere.
               
                  VPon this rumour the .xxviii. daye of Aprill, diuerse yoūge
men of the citie assauted the Alyens as they passed by the
stretes, and some were strikē, &amp; some buffeted, &amp; some throwen
in the canel. Wherfore the Mayre sent diuerse persōs
to ward, as Stephyn Studley skynner, and Bettes and
Stephenson &amp; diuerse other, some to one coūter, &amp; some to another, and
some to Newgate. Then sodeynly was a cōmen secret rumour, &amp; no mā
could tell how it began, that on May daye next, the citie would rebell &amp;
slaye all Aliens, in somuche as diuerse straungers fled oute of the citie.
This brute ranne so farre that it came to the kynges coūsayl, insomuch
as the Cardinall beyng lord Chaūcelour, sent for Ihon Rest Mayre of
the citie, and other of the counsail of the citie, &amp; demaūded of the Mayre
in what case the citie stode, to whome he aunswered that it was wel &amp; in
good quyet: Nay sayd the Cardinal, it is informed vs that your yoūg
and ryotous people will ryse &amp; distresse the straungiers, heare ye of no
such thing? No surely sayd the Mayre, &amp; I trust so to gouerne thē that
the kynges peace shalbe obserued, &amp; that I dare vndertake if I &amp; my
brethren the Aldermen may be suffered. Wel sayd ye Cardi
                     •

preuent it. The Mayre came from the Cardinals at 
                     〈…〉
                  
after none on May euen, &amp; demaūded of the officiers what they

                  ▪
diuerse of thē aunswered that the voyce of the people was so, &amp; had ben
so .ii. or .iii. dayes before. This heryng the Mayre 
                     •
                  ent for al his brethrē
to the Guylde hall in great hast, &amp; almost .vii. of the clocke or the assemble
wasset. Then was declared to thē by Master brooke y• recorder how
that the kynges coūsail had reported to thē y• the cōminaltie that night
would ryse, &amp; distresse all the Aliēs &amp; straungers yt inhabited in the citie
of Lōdon: the Aldermē aūswered they harde say so, but they mistrusted
not the matter, but yet they sayd that it was wel done to forsee it. Then
sayd the recorder, it were best that a substācial watche were set of honest
persons, housholders, whiche might withstand the euell doers. An Alderman
sayde, that it was euell to rayse men in harneys, for if suche a
thinge were entended, they coulde not tell who woulde take their parte.
Another Alderman sayd, that it were best to kepe the younge men asonder,
and euery man to shut in hys doores, and to kepe hys seruauntes
within. Then with these opinions was the Recorder sent to ye Cardinal
before .viii. of the clocke, and then he with suche as were of the kynges
counsaill at hys place, commaūded that in no wyse watche shoulde be
kept, but that euery man shoulde repayre to hys awne house, and there
to kepe hym and hys seruauntes tyl .vii. of the clocke of the mornynge:
with whiche commaundement, the sayde Rycharde brooke serge

the lawe and recorder, and lyr Thomas Moore, late vndershrife of Lō
                  don,
&amp; then of the kynges coūsaill, came to the Guy
                     •
                  de hall halfe houre
and before .ix. of the clocke, and there shewed the commaundemēt of the
kynges counsayl. Then in all hast, euery Alderman sent to his warde
that no man should styrre after .ix. of the clocke out of his house,
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      may day but to
kepe hys doores shut, and hys seruauntes within tyll .vii. of the clocke
in the mornynge. After this commaundement, syr Ihon Mondy Alderman
came from hys warde, and founde two young men in Chepe plaiynge
at Buckelers, and a great company of young men lokynge on thē
for the commaundement was then skace knowen, for then it was but .ix

                     •
                  dy seyng that, bade them leaue, and the one
younge man asked hym why? and then he sayd thou shalt know, &amp; toke
hym by the arme to haue had him to the counter. Then all the yoūg mē
resisted the Alderman, &amp; toke him from master Mondy, and cryed prentyses
and clubbes. Then out at euery doore came clubbes and weapōs
and the Alderman fled, and was in great daung
                     •
                  er. Then more people
arose out of euery quarter, and oute came seruynge men, and water men
and Courtiers, and by a .xi, of the clocke there were in Chepe .vi. or .vii.
hundreth. And oute of Paules churcheyarde came .iii. hundreth, which
wist not of the other, and so out of all places they gathered, and brake
vp the counters, and tooke out the prisoners, that the Mayre had thether
committed for hurtynge of the straungers, and came to Newgate
and tooke out Studley and Petyr, committed thether for that cause.
The Mayre and Shrifes were there present, and made Proclamaciō
in the kynges name, but nothynge was obeyed. Thus they ranne a
plump thorow sainct Nycholas Shābles, &amp; at saynct Martyns gate,
there met with them syr Thomas Moore and other, desyrynge theym
to go to their lodgynges: And as they were intreatyng, and had almost
brought them to a staye. The people of 
                     •
                  aynct Martynes threwe oute
stones and battes, and hurte dyuerse honest persones, that were persuadynge
the ryotous people to ceasse, and they bade them holde their
handes, but still they threwe oute bryckes and hoate water. Then a sergeaunt
of Armes called Nycholas dounes, whiche was there with master
Moore, entreatynge them, beynge sore hurt, in a fury cryed doune
with them. Then all the misruled persons ranne to the dores and wyndowes
of saynct Martyn, and spoyled all that they founde, and caste it
into the strete, and lefte fewe houses vnspoyled. And after that they
ranne hedlynge into Cornehill by Leaden hal, to the house of one Mutuas
a Frencheman or Pycarde borne, whiche was a greate bearer of
Frenchemen, were they pyckpursses, or howe euell disposicion soeuer
they were of, and within hys gate, called Grenegate, dwelled dyuerse
Frenchmen that kalendred Worsted, contrary to the kynges lawes: &amp;
all they were so borne out by thesame Mutuas, yt no mā durst medle wt
them, wherfore he was sore hated, &amp; if the people had found him in their

fury, they would haue striken of his head: but whē they foūd hym not,
the water men, &amp; certayn young priestes that were there fell to rif
                     •
                  ynge:
some ranne to Blāchechapelton, &amp; brake the straūgers houses, &amp; threwe
shooes and bootes into the strete: This from .x. or .xi. of the clocke, continued
these ryotous people, durynge, whiche cyme a knight called syr
Thomas parr, in great hast went to the Cardinall &amp; tolde him of thys
ryot, which incōtinent strengthened his house with men &amp; ordinaunce.
And after, this knight roade to the kyng to Richemōd, &amp; made ye report
much more then it was: Wherfore the king hastely sent to Lōdō, &amp; was
truly aduertised of the matter, &amp; how that the ryot was ceassed, &amp; many
of the doers apprehēded. But while this ruffling cōtinued, syr Richard
Cholmeley knyght, Lieutenaūt of the Towre, no great frende co the citie,
in a frantyke fury losed certayn peces of ordinaunce, &amp; shot into y•
citie, whiche did litle harme, howbeit his good wil apered. About .iii. of
the clocke, these ryotous persons seuered and went to their places of resorte,
&amp; by the waye they were taken by the Mayre and the heddes of y•
citie, and some sent to the Towre, and some to Newgate, and some to the
Counters, to the number of .iii.C. some fled, and specially the watermen
and priestes, &amp; seruyng men, but the poore prentises were taken. About
fyue of the clocke, the erles of Shrewesbury and Surrey, whiche had
harde of this ryot, came to London with suche strength as they had, so
dyd the Innes of court, and diuerse noble men: but or they came, all the
ryot was ceased, and many taken as you haue heard.
               Then were the prisoners examined, &amp; the sermon of docter Bele called
to remembraunce, and he taken &amp; sent to the Towre, &amp; so was Ihon
Lyncoln: but with this ryot the Cardinall was sore displeased. Then y•
iiii. day of May was an Oyer &amp; determiner at Londō before y• Mayre,
the duke of Norffolke, the erle of Surrey and other. The citie thought
that the duke bare them grudge for a lewde priest of his, which the yere
before was slayn in Chepe, in so much the duke then in his fury sayd, I
pray God I may once haue the citezēs in my daungier: &amp; the duke also
thought that they bare him no good wil, wherfore he came into the citie
wtith .xiii.C. men in harneys to kepe the Oyer &amp; determiner. And vpō
examinaciō it could neuer be proued of any metyng, gathering, talking
or conuenticle at any daye or tyme before y• day, but that the chaūce so
happened wtout any matter prepensed of any creature sauing Lyncoln
&amp; neuer an honest person in maner was taken but onely he. Then Proclamacions
were made that no womē shoulde come together to bable &amp;
talke, but all men should kepe their wyues in their houses. All the stretes
y• were notable stode ful of harnessed men, which spake many opprobrious
wordes to the citezens, which greued them sore: &amp; if they woulde
haue bene reuenged, the other had had the worsse, for the citezēs were .ii.C.
to one: but lyke true subiectes they suffred paciently.
               When the lordes were set, the prisoners were brought in thorough y•
stretes tyed in ropes, some men, some laddes, some chyldren of .xiii. yere.

There was a great mourning of fathers &amp; frendes for their chyldren &amp;
kyn
                     ••
                  olke. Emong the prisoners many were not of the citie, some were
priestes, and some husbandmen &amp; laborers, the whole some of the prisoners
were

                  .C.lxxviii. persons. The cause of the treason was, because
the kyng had amitie with all Christen prynces, that they had brokē the
tru

                   &amp; league, cōtrary to the statute of kyng Hēry the .v. Of this treasō
diuerse were endited, &amp; so for yt tyme, the lordes departed. And the next
day the duke came agayn, &amp; the erle of Surrey with .ii.M. armed men,
which kept the stretes. Whē the Mayre, the duke, &amp; y• erle of Shrewsbury
&amp; Surrey were set, the prisoners were arreigned, and .xiii. founde
giltye of high treason, &amp; adiudged to be hanged, drawen &amp; quartered, &amp;
for execucion wherof, were set vp .xi. payre of galowes in diuerse places
where the offences were done, as at Algate, at Blāchechapel
                     •
                  ō, Gracious
strete, Leadē hal, &amp; before euery coūter one, &amp; at Newgate, at s. Marteus,
at Aldrisgate, at Bishopsgate. This sight sore greued the people
to se galowes set in the kynges chāber. Then were ye prysoners y• were
iudged brought to the places of execuciō, &amp; executed in most rygorous
maner, for the lord Edmōd haward sonne to the duke of Northfolke, &amp;
knight Mershal shewed no mercy, but extreme cruelty to the poore yō
                  gelinges
in their execuciō, &amp; likewise the dukes seruaūtes spake many
opprobrious wordes, some bad hāge, some bad drawe, some bad set the
citie on fy
                     ••
                  , but all was suffred.
               On Thursday the .vii. day of May was Lyncoln, Shyrwyn, &amp; two
brethrē called Bets, and diuerse other adiudged to dye. Then Lyncoln
said▪ my lordes, I meant wel, for &amp; you knew the mischief that is ensued
in this realme by straūgers, you would remedy it, &amp; many tymes I haue
cōplayned, &amp; then I was called a busy felow: now our lord haue mercy
on me. Then all thesayd persons were layd on the hardels, &amp; drawen
to the standarde in Chepe, &amp; first was Ihon Lyncoln executed, &amp; as the
other had the rope about their neckes, there came a commaūdemēt frō
the kyng to respite execucion. Then the people cryed, God saue ye king.
Then was the Oyer and determiner deferred tyll another daye, and the
prisoners sent agayn to warde, and the harnessed men departed oute of
London, and all thynges quyet.
               The .xi. daye of Maye the kynge came to his maner of Grenewiche,
where the recorder of London &amp; diuerse Aldermen came to speake with
his grace, and al ware gounes of black coloure. And when they percea

and souereigne lorde, we knowe well that your grace is displeased with
vs of your citie of Lōdon for the great ryot late done: we assertein your
grace that none of vs, nor no honest person were condesendynge to that
enormitie, and yet we, oure wyfes and chyldrē euery houre lament that
your fauour shoulde be taken from vs, and forasmuche as light &amp; ydle
persones were the doers of thesame, we moost hūbly beseche your grace

to haue mercy of vs for our negligence, &amp; compassion of the offendours
for their offence and trespasse.
               Truly sayd the kyng, you haue highly displeased and offended vs, &amp;
ye oughte to wayle and be sory for thesame, and where ye saye that you
the substanciall persons were not concentyng to thesame, it appereth to
the contrary, for you neuer moued to let theim, nor sturred once to fight
with theim, whiche you saye were so small a numbre of light persones,
wherefore we must thynke, and you cannot deny, but you dyd wyncke
at the matter, but at this tyme we will graunt to you neither our fauor
nor good will, nor to thoffenders mercy, but resort to the Cardinall our
lord Chaūcelour, &amp; he shal make you an answer &amp; declare our pleasure,
and with this answer ye lōdoners departed &amp; made relaciō to y• Maior▪
               
               The .xviii. day of this moneth the quene of Scottes, which had bene
at the Courte and at Baynardes Castell, a whole yere at the kynges
charge, and was richely apoynted of all thinges mete to her estate, both
of Iewells, plate, tapissry, Arras, Coyne, Horsses, and all other thinges
of the kynges gift &amp; liberalitie, departed out of London toward Scotland
with great ryches, albeit she came into Englande with muche pouertie,
and she entred into Scotland the .xiii. daye of Iuyn, whome her
husband receaued at Berwick: but the Englishmen smally him regarded.
All her charges within the realme, comminge to the courte &amp; returnynge,
were of the kynges pursse.
               Thursdaye the .xxii. day of May the kynge came into Westmynster
hall, for whome at the vpper ende was set a clothe of estate, &amp; the place
hanged with Arras, with him was the Cardinal, the dukes of Northfolke
&amp; Suffolke, ye erles of Shrewsbury, fo Essex &amp; Wilshyre, of Surrey,
with many lordes &amp; other of the kinges coūsail. The Mayre &amp; Aldermē,
&amp; al the chief of the citie were there in their best liuery (according
as the Cardinal had thē apoynted) by .ix. of the clock. Then the kynge
cōmaunded y• all the prisoners should be brought foorth. Then came in
the poore yoūglinges &amp; olde false knaues boūde in ropes all along, one
after another in their shertes, &amp; euery one a halter about his neck, to the
nūber of .iiii.C. mē &amp; .xi. womē. And whē all were come before y• kinges
presence, the Cardinal sore laied to the Mayre &amp; cōminaltie their negligēce,
&amp; to the prisoners he declared y• they had deserued death for their
offence: Then al the prisoners together cryed mercy gracious lord, mercy.
Then the lordes altogether besought his grace or mercy, at whose request
the kyng pardoned thē al. And then the Cardinal gaue vnto thē a
good exhortacion to the great gladnes of the herers. And whē the generall
pardō was pronoūced, all ye prisoners shouted atonce, &amp; altogether
cast vp their halters into y• hall roffe, so y• the kyng might perceaue they
were none of the discretest sorte. Here is to be noted y• diuerse offenders
which were not takē, hering y• king was inclined to mercy, came wel
appareled to Westmynster, &amp; sodeynly stryped thē into their shertes wt
halters, &amp; came in emōg the prisoners willingly, to be partakers of the

kynges pardon, by the whiche doyng, it was well knowen that one Ihō
Gelson yoman of the Croune, was the first that began to spoyle, and exhorted
other to dooe thesame, and because he fled and was not taken, he
came in the rope with the other prisoners, and so had his pardon. This
compaignie was after called the blacke Wagon. Then were all the galowes
within the citee taken doune, and many a good praier saied 
                     •
                  or
the kyng, and the citezens toke more hede to their seruauntes.
               In I
                     •
                  ne the kyng had with hym diuerse Ambassadors, for solace of
whom he prepared a costly Iustes, he hymself and .xii. against the duke
of Suffolk and other .xii. his base and bard was the one halfe clothe of
siluer, and the other halfe blacke Tinsell. On the siluer was a curious
lose worke of white veluet embraudered with Golde, cut on the Siluer
and euery cut engrailed with golde, so that that side was golde, Siluer
and veluet. On the blacke tynsell side was blacke veluet embraudered
with golde and cut and euery cut was engrayled with flat gold of Damaske.
The base and barde were broudered with greate letters of massy
golde Bullion, full of pearles and stones, merueilous riche: al his compaignie
wer in like suite, sauyng that thei had no iuelles. The kyng had
on his hed a ladies sleue full of Diamondes. On the kyng attended gē
                  tlemen,
Armourers, and other officiers to the nomber of .Cxxv. persones
all in white Ueluet and white Sattyn, horse and harneis for horsemen,
Cappes and Hosen for footemen, all white at the kinges cost. This royally
the kyng &amp; his compaignie with his waiters came to the tiltes ende
               Then entered the Duke of Suffolke with the Marques Dorcet, the
Erles of Essex and Surrey, and .viii. other of his bande, in bardes and
bases of white Ueluet &amp; crimosin sattin losenged, set full of letters of. C.
M. of gold, 
                     •
                  or Charles &amp; Mary, and thei toke the other ende of the tilt.
Then the Trompettes blewe, and the Kyng and the Duke ranne fiercely
together, and brake many speres, and so did all the other, that it was
harde to saie who did best: but when the courses were ronne, thei ranne
volant one at another, so that bothe by the reporte of sir Edwarde Gylforde
Master of the Armury, and also of the Iudges and Heraldes, at
these Iustes wer broken fiue hūdred and sixe speres: and then the kyng
thesame night made to the Ambassadors a sumpteous banket, with many
ridelles and muche pastyme.
               After this greate triumphe, the kyng appointed his gestes for his pastyme
this Sommer, but sodeinly there came a plague of sickenes, called
the Swetyng sickenes, that turned all his purpose. This malady
was so cruell that it killed some within three houres, some within twoo
houres, some mery at diner and dedde at supper. Many died in the kynges
Courte, the Lorde Clinton, the Lorde Grey of Wilton, and many
knightes, Gentlemen and officiers. For this plague Mighelmas terme
was adiourned and because that this malady continued from Iuly to
the middes of December, the kyng kept hymself euer with a small compaignie,
and kept no solempne Christmas, willyng to haue no resort for

feare of infeccion: but muche lamented the nomber of his people, for in
some one toune halfe the people died, and in some other toune the thirde
parte, the Sweate was so feruent and infeccious.
            
            
               ¶The .x. yere.
               
                  IN the beginnyng of this yere,The .ix. yere. Trinite terme was begon at
Oxenford, where it continued but one day, and was again
adiourned to Westminster. This yere came to Calice frō
Pope Leo, a legate de latere, called Laurence Campeius,
commonly called the Cardinall Campeius, for to exhorte
the kyng to make warre on the Turke. And likewise thesaied Leo sent
iii. other legates furth, at that tyme for thesaid purpose, one into Fraūce
another into Spain, and the third into Germany.
               When the Cardinall of Yorke knewe, that there was commyng a legate
into Englande, whiche should haue a greater preheminence then
a Cardinall, he whose ambicion was neuer satisfied, caused a Bisshoppe
and certain Docters to passe the Sea to Calice to welcome hym, and to
shewe hym that if he would haue the Popes purpose, to take any effecte
in Englande, he should in any wise sende in poste to Rome, to haue thesaied
Cardinall of Yorke to be legate also, and to be ioyned in commission
with hym, whiche thyng was doen, (not without good rewardes) so
that in thirtie and fiue daies, the bull was broughte to Calice. Duryng
whiche tyme the Cardinall of Yorke sent to the Legate to Calice, redde
cloth to clothe his seruauntes, whiche at their commyng to Calice, were
but meanely appareled. And when all thynges were ready, he passed the
sea and landed at Douer, and so kept furthe his iorney toward Londō.
At euery toune as thei passed▪ he was receiued with Procession, and accompaignied
with all the Lordes and gentlemen of Kent. And when he
came to Black heth, there met hym the Duke of Norffolke, with a great
nomber of prelates, knightes and gentlemen, all richely appareled. And
in the waie he was brought into a riche tente of clothe of golde, where he
shifted hymself into a robe of a Cardinall, edged with Ermyns, and so
toke his Moyle ridyng toward London.
               The night before he came to London, the Cardinall of Yorke, to furnishe
the carriages of the Cardinall Campeius, sent to hym twelue mulettes
with emptie Cofers couered with redde, whiche twelue Mulettes
wer led through London, emongest the Mulettes of Campeius, whiche
were but eight and so these .xx. Mulettes passed through the stretes, as
though thei had been full of treasures, apparell, and other necessaries.
And when thei came into Chepe, one of the Mulettes brake from her
keper, and ouerthrewe the Chestes, and ouerturned twoo or three other
Mulettes cariages, whiche fell with suche a violence, that diuerse of
theim vnlocked, and out of some fell olde Hosen, broken Shoen, and
roasted Fleshe, peces of Breade, Egges and muche vile baggage:
at whiche sight
                     •
                   the Boyes cryed, see, see my Lorde Legates threasure,

and so the Muleters wer ashamed, and tooke vp all their stuffe &amp; passed
furth. And about thre of the clock at after none on the .xxix. day of Iuly
thesaid legate entred the cite, &amp; in Sothwarke met hym all the clergie of
London, with crosses sensers &amp; copes &amp; sensed him with great reuerence.
The Maior and Aldermen, and all the occupacions of the citee in their
best liueries stode in the stretes, &amp; hym highly honored: to whō sir Thomas
More made a brief oraciō in the name of the citee. And whē he cam
to Paules, ther he was receiued by bishops mitred, and vnder a canapy
entred the churche: whiche canapy his seruaūtes toke for their fees. And
when he had offred, he gaue his benediccion to al the people, and toke again
his mule, &amp; so was with al his train aforsaid, conueighed to Bathe
place▪ &amp; there rested: where he was welcomed of the Cardinall of Yorke.
And on Sondaie next ensuyng these twoo Cardinalles as legates, toke
their barges &amp; came to 
                     •
                  renewiche, eche of them had beside their crosses
two pillers of siluer, two litle axes gilte, and two cloke bagges embroudered,
and the Cardinalles hattes borne before thē. And when thei came
to the kynges hall, the Cardinall of Yorke went on the right hande: and
there the kyng royally appareled and accompaignied, met them 
                     •
                  uen as
though bothe had come from Rome, and so brought them bothe vp into
his chamber of presence, and there was a solempne oracion made by an
Italian, declaryng the cause of the legacy to be in twoo articles, one for
aide against Gods enemies, and the second for reformacion of the Clergie.
And when Masse was doen, thei were had to a chamber, and serued
with lordes and knightes, with muche solempnitie: and after dinner thei
toke their leaue of the kyng and came to London, and rode through the
citee together, in greate pompe and glory, to their lodgynges.
               When the Cardinall of Yorke was thus a legate, he set vp a court, &amp;
called it the court of the legate, and proued testamētes, and hard causes
to the great hinderaunce of all the bishops of the realme. He visited bisshopes
and all the Clergie, exempt and not exempt, and vnder colour of
reformacion he gat muche treasure, &amp; nothyng was reformed, but came

by reason of his aucthorities &amp; faculties, that no mā durst once reproue
any thyng in thē, for feare to bee called heretike, &amp; then thei would make
hym smoke or beare a faggot. And the Cardinall hymself was so elated
that he thought hymself 
                     •
                  gall with the kyng: &amp; when he had said Masse

               This yere the French kyng wrote to the kyng of England▪ y• if it wer

the kyng &amp; his counsaill for the redemyng of the citee of Turney &amp; other
thynges: whiche answered the messenger, y• the ambassade of the Frenche

kyngs should be right hartely welcome to him. And so the French king
sent into England the lorde Boneuet, hygh Admyral of Fraunce, &amp; the
bishop of Parys as chiefe Ambassadors, accompanyed with many noble
men, &amp; young freshe galātes of the courte of Fraunce, to the nūbre of

and brought ouer hattes and cappes, and diuerse merchaūdise vncustomed,

with an .C.lx. gentlemen, rychely appareled, on goodly horsses
came to blackheth, &amp; there amiably receaued y• Ambassadors of Fraūce.
The yoūg gala
                     ••
                  es of Fraūce had coates garded with one colour, cut
in .x. or .xii. partes very richely to beholde: &amp; so al the Englishmē accoupled
thē selues with the Frenchmen, louingly together, &amp; so roade to Lō
                  don.
After the .ii. Admyrals folowed .xxiiii. of the Frēche kynges garde
whome accompanyed .xxiiii. of the kynges garde. And after thē a great
numbre of archers, to the nūbre of .iiii.C. And in this order they passed
thorough the citie to Taylers hal, &amp; there the chiefe Ambassadors were
lodged, &amp; the rēnaunt in marchaūtes houses about. When these lordes
were in their lodgynges, then the Frēch harder mē opened their wares,
&amp; made the Taylers hal lyke to the paunde of a marte. At this doynge
many an Englishmā grudged, but it auailed not. The last day of Septēber,
the Frēch Ambassadors toke their barge, &amp; came to Grenewiche.
The Admyrall was in a goune of cloth of siluer raysed, furred with ryche
Sables, &amp; al his cōpany almost were in a new fassiō garmēt, called
a Shemew, which was in effect a goune, cut in the middle. The gētlemē
of Fraūce were brought to the kynges presence, wher the bishop of Parys
made a solēpne oraciō: which beyng ended, &amp; aūswer made therto, y•
kyng highly entreteyned the Admirall &amp; hys company, and so dyd all
the English lordes and gentlemen. The Ambassadours beyng dayly in
counsail at Grenewiche, the other gentlemen daunced &amp; passed the tyme
in the quenes chābre with ladies &amp; gentlewomen. After long coūsailing
&amp; muche desyring of the French kyng and his counsayll, it was agreed
that the citie of Tourney should be deliuered to the Frenche kynge, he
payenge .vi. hundred thousande crounes for the citie and .iiii. hundred
thousand crounes for the Castell, the which ye kyng had buylded, but it
was not fully performed: &amp; also he should pay .xxiii.M. l. Tourneys, y•
                  
whiche summe the citezens of the citie of Turney ought to the kyng of
England for their liberties and fraunchises.
               Upon these agremētes to be performed, it was cōcluded that y• citye
of Tourney should be deliuered to the French kyng. The Frenchmen y•
soner to come to their purpose, made a pretēce of mariage to be had betwene
the Dolphyn, sonne &amp; heyre to the Frēche kyng &amp; the lady Mary
the kynges daughter, which was agreed vpō this cōdicion, that if they
both cōsented at lawful age, then to be ferme &amp; stable, or els not: for thē
they were both very young. And so all matters were concluded, and the
erle of Worcester &amp; the bishop of Ely apoynted to go into Fraunce for
the deliuery of the citie of Tourney, and performyng of the other agrementes.
And for the sure payment of the summes of money to be payde
to the kyng of England, vpō thesayd agrementes, there were .iiii. gentelmen
of the realme of Fraunce, left in Englande for hostages: whose
names were Mounsire Memorancy, Moūsire Monpesart, Mounsire
Moy, Mounsire Morret. Of the which .iiii. the .ii. fyrst named were of
noble blood, but the .ii. last were but of meane houses. And because they
were yoūg, there was auncient gentlemē, apoynted gouernours to thē.
               When all thinges were cōcluded &amp; sealed, the kyng and all the Ambassadours
richely appareled &amp; the .ii. legates, roade solēply to y• church
of saynct Paul frō the bishop of Durhās place: &amp; there was made frō
the West doore to the quere doore of the churche egall with the highest
step, a hautepace of tymber of .xii. fote broade, that the kyng &amp; the Ambassadors
might be sene. And there the Cardinall of Yorke sange hygh
masse, &amp; had hys cloth of estate of Tyssue: hys Cupboord set with basōs
all gilt couered: his place was .v. steppes high. At the first lauatory, iii.
Erles serued him, &amp; at the secōd .ii. dukes &amp; a Marques, &amp; with the saye
taken, they gaue hym wyne, &amp; after water. And when masse was done, y•
Cardinal Campeius &amp; he gaue to the people (as they sayd) cleane remission.
And after that done, docter Pace the kynges secretory, a man very
eloquent, made a goodly Oracion in prayse of peace: and that done, the
kyng &amp; all his nobles and Ambassadors went to the Bishops palace to
dynner, where they were highly feasted. And after dynner, the kynge
roade agayne to the bishop of Durhams place.
               That night the Cardinal of Yorke made to the Ambassadors a solempne
bāket, &amp; them accōpanyed many lordes &amp; ladyes of Englande.
And when the banket was done, in came .vi. mynstrels, richely disguysed,
&amp; after them folowed .iii. gentelmen in wyde &amp; lōg gounes of Crymosyn
sattyn, euery one hauing a cup of golde in theyr handes, the first
cup was ful of Angels &amp; royals, the second had diuerse bales of dyce, &amp;
the .iii. had certayn payres of Cardes. These gētlemē offred to playe at
mōchaunce, &amp; whē they had played y• length of the first boorde, then the
mynstrels blew vp, &amp; then entred into the chābre .xii. ladyes disguysed,

daūced at one tyme, &amp; after they had daunced, they put of their vizers,
&amp; then they were all knowē. The Admyral &amp; lordes of Fraūce hartely
thanked the kyng that it pleased him to viset thē with such disport
and then the kyng &amp; his cōpany were banketed, &amp; had high chere, &amp; then
they departed euery man to hys lodgynge.
               The .viii. day of October at Grenewiche was song a solēpne masse by

euery man to be obedient to the kinges pleasure &amp; to prepare to returne
into England. The .viii. day of February y• lord Chatileon came
nere to the citie of Tournay with .xxi. hundreth menne in harneys. The
erle of Worcettre sent sir Edward Belknap to knowe his commission,
and there he shewed him his commission, whiche was to receiue the citie
of Tourney. Then sir Edward Belknap desired him to sende his commission
to the earle of Worcettre, whiche he refused to do, saiyng it was
sufficient to shewe it: well sayd sir Edward Belknap you must vnderstand
that we haue a commission from the kyng our Master to deliuer
you the citie at a day appointed: wherfore we must shewe the kyng of
England both your cōmission that you had aucthoritie to receiue it frō
the Frenche king, and also that you by your indenture sealed with your
seale of armes shall confesse that you receiue the citie as a gift, and not
rendred as a right to the kyng your Master, or els be you sure that the
citie shall not be deliuered.Themaner of the delyuery of Tourn

                     y. Then the lorde Chastileon was wonderous
wroth that he was no better beleued: And so daily were great messages
sent to the citie from him to the erle of Worcettre, and answers wer sent
of the Englishe part. But when the daye approched he had ful answere
that he must delyuer his commission and also seale the indenture, or els
the Englishmen woulde nto put hym in possession of the towne, for their
commission was otherwyse. The French capytaines perceauyng that
yf they disagreed at the daye, that doubtes might folowe, wherfore they
sent their commission and sealed their indenture and sent it lykewyse in
the mornyng, and came forward with their banners displayed: whereof
hering the earle, he sent woord that the citee was neither yelded nor gotten,
but delyuered for cōfederacion of mariage, and therfore thei should

not entre with banners displaied. Then wer the Frenchemen angry, but
there was no remedy but to rolle vp their standerdes and banners. And
when thei came to the gates, there their commission and Indenture wer
solemply red openly: and then the Frenchemen entred with drumslades
and minstrelsy without any banner: and then to Monsire Castileon was
deliuered the Castle, and there he ordeined watche and warde in euery
part. Thus was the citee of Turnay deliuered the eight daie of February
in the .x. yere of the reigne of the kyng, and many a tall yoman that
lacked liuyng fel to robbyng, which would not labor after their returne
               Duryng this tyme remained in the Frenche courte Nicholas Carew
Fraunces Brian, and diuerse other of the young gentlemen of Englāde
and thei with the Frenche kyng roade daily disguysed through Paris,
throwyng Egges, stones and other foolishe trifles at the people, whiche
light demeanoure of a kyng was muche discommended and gested at.
And when these young gentlemē came again into Englande, 
                     •
                  hei wer al
Frenche, in eatyng, drynkyng and apparell, yea, and in Frenche vices
and bragges, so that all the estates of Englande were by them laughed
at: the ladies and gentlewomen wer dispraised, so that nothyng by them
was praised, but if it were after the Frenche turne, whiche after turned
them to displeasure as you shall here.
               After the kynges Ambassadors wer returned, and Tournay deliuered
to the Frenchemen vpon the condicions aforesaid, the hostages that
were here lefte for the paiment of the greate somes and performaunce of
the condicions comprised in the league (of the which one was that if the
mariage toke none effect, then the citee of Turnay should be redeliuered
vpon repaiment of thesame some) thesaied hostages knewe not in what
case thei stode, but when thei knewe it, thei wer very heuy and sorowful:
howbeit, thei dissimuled the matter in the best wise thei could. The kyng
vsed familiarly these foure hostages, and on the .vii. daie of Marche prepared
a disguysyng, and caused his greate chambre at Grenewiche to be
staged, and greate

gilt, and the rofe was couered with blewe sattin set full of presses of fine
gold and flowers: and vnder was written, Iammes, the meanyng wherof
was, that the flower of youth could not be oppressed. Into this chamber
came the kyng and the quene with the hostages, and there was a goodly
commedy of Plautus plaied, and that doen, there entred into the chamber
eight ladies in blacke veluet bordred about with gold, with hoopes
frō the wast douneward, and sleues ruffed and plited at the elbowe and
plain in the middes, full of cuttes, plucked out at euery cutte with fine
Camericke, and tired like to the Egipcians very richely. And whē these
ladies had passed aboute the place, in came eight noble personages in
long gounes of taffe

                  a set with flowers of gold bullion, and vnder that
apparell cotes of blacke veluet embroudered with golde all to cut, and
plucked out with cu

                  tes of white sarcenet, and euery man had buskins
of blacke veluet full of agglettes of gold. Then the eight men daunced

with the eight ladies all beyng viserd, and sodeinly the men cast of their
large gounes, and then their vnder apparell was seen. And whē al was
dooen, euery lorde and lady put of their visers, and then it was knowen
that the kyng and the duke of Suffolk and the Frenche quene wer ther
whiche wer present at the plaie tyme.
               The .viii. daie of Marche was a solempne Iustes,A iuste

with gold, against the duke of Suffolk and eight of his bande all in
white satten with droppes of golde. And that daie thei all ranne exceadyng
well, whiche the straungiers highly commended.
               In the ende of Marche the kyng sent for all the yomen of garde that
wer come from Tourney▪ and after many good wordes geuen to th

graūted to thē .iiii.d. the day without attendaunce, except thei wer specially
cōmaunded: &amp; yet for all this the cōminaltie said that the kyng was
euil counsailed to geue away the citee of Tourney, because the mainteining
of a garrison there should haue norished &amp; brought vp mē and yō

               This yere the .xii. daie of February died the Emperour Maximilian
for whom the kyng caused a solempne Obsequy to be dooen at Paules
churche, all the nobles of the realme and knightes of the Gartier beyng
present, of whiche ordre thesaied Emperour was one.
            
            
               ¶The .xi. yere.
               
                  IN the beginnyng of this yere,The .xi. yere. the kyng with all the knightes of
his ordre beyng in Englande, roade on double horsses, with the
henxmen folowyng the king, from Colbroke to Winsore in gorgious
apparell, and there he kept with greate solempnitee the feast of .s.
George, and dined in the hall. And the bishop of Wynchester prelate of
the ordre sat at the boordes ende alone. The king was solempnly serued
and the surnap cast like the feast of a coronacion. All thynges wer plenteous
to straungiers that resorted thether. At the Masse of Requiem
was offered the banner and other hachementes of honor belongyng to
Maximilian the Emperor late deceased. After this feast ended, the kyng
came to Richemond, and so to Grenewiche, and there laie all Maie.
               In whiche moneth the kynges counsaill secretly communed together
of the kynges gentlenes &amp; liberalitee to all persones: by the whiche thei
perceiued that certain young men in his priuie chamber, not regardyng
his estate nor degree, were so familier and homely with hym, and plaied
suche light touches with hym that thei forgat themselfes: Whiche thynges
although the kyng of his gētle nature suffred and not rebuked nor
reproued it: yet the kynges counsail thought it not mete to be suffred for
the kynges honor, &amp; therfore thei altogether came to the king, beseching
him al these enormities and lightnes to redresse. To whom the kyng answered,
that he had chosen thē of his counsaill, both for the maintenaūce
of his honor, &amp; for the defence of all thyng that might blemishe the same:
wherfore if thei sawe any about hym misuse theimselfes, he committed it

to their reformacion. Then the kynges counsaill caused the lorde chamberlein
to cal before them Carew (and another who yet liueth, &amp; therfore
shall not at this tyme be named) with diuerse other also of the priuy chā
                  ber,
whiche had been in the Frenche courte, and banished them the court
for diuerse consideracions, laiyng nothyng perticulerly to their charges
And thei that had offices wer commaunded to go to their offices: which
discharge out of the courte greued sore the hartes of these young menne
whiche were called the kynges minions. Then was there foure sad and
auncient knightes, put into the kynges priuie chāber, whose names wer
sir Richard Wingfeld, sir Richard Iernynghā, sir Richard Westō and
sir Willian Kyngston: and diuerse officers wer changed in all places.
               Then sir Ihon Pe
                     •
                  hy was made deputie of Calis, and sir Richarde
Wingfeld therof discharged, &amp; Nicholas Carew made capitain of Rice

been in Fraunce, and so highly praised the Frenche kyng and his court,
that in a maner thei thought litle of the kyng and his court, in comparison
of the other, thei wer so high in loue with the Frenche courte, wherefore
their fall was litle mo

               This yere in the moneth of Iune was elected to be Emperor Charles
kyng of Castell, &amp; nephew to the quene, by the whole assēt of the electors
of thempire: Although the Frenche kyng sent his great Master to cause
hym to be elected to the high maiestie of the Empire: yet his Ambassador
&amp; great Master of his houshold called Gonffier lord of Boisy, &amp; brother
to Willyam, Gonffier lorde Boneuet Admirall of Fraunce, whiche was
ambassador in Englande the laste yere as you haue hard, did not so his
message that it toke any effect. The kyng whiche had sēt docter Pace his
secretory for the auauncement of his nephewe the kyng of Castell to the
dignite imperiall, because he had the duchie of Ostrik &amp; many other seigniories
in Almain, was very ioyous of this eleccion, &amp; caused a solēpne
Masse to be song at Paules the .vii. daie of Iuly: at whiche Masse was
present the Cardinall Campeius, the Cardinall of Yorke, the Duke of
Buckynghā, of Norffolk &amp; Suffolk, with the Ambassadors of Spain,
Fraunce, Uenice and Scotlande. And after Masse was doen, the quier
sang Te deum, and then all the lordes departed to Baynardes Castle to
dinner, &amp; that night wer solempne fiers made through London, &amp; greate
plēty of wine geuē by Italiēs, duchmen &amp; Spaniardes for these newes.
               This sommer the quene desired the kyng to bryng to her mannour of
Haueryng in the Bowe
                     •
                   in Essex, the gentlemen of Fraūce beyng hostages.
And for their welcōmyng she purueyed all thynges in the moste liberallest
maner: and especially she made to the kyng suche a sumpteous
banket that the kyng thanked her hartely, and the straungers gaue it
greate praise. The kyng liyng there did shote, hunte, and ronne daily
with the hostages to their greate ioye.
               This yere in September the kyng laie at his Manour of Newhal in

Essex, otherwise called Beaulieu, where the kyng had newly buylded a
costly mancion, and there to welcome the quene and the Lordes, and the
Frenche gentlemen, he made to them a sumpteous banket, and all a lōg
the chamber sat a Ladie and a Lorde, or a knight, whiche were plenteously
serued. And after the banket ended, with noyse of mins
                     •
                  relles entered
into the chamber eight Maskers with white berdes, and long and
large garmentes of Blewe satten pauned with Sipres, poudered with
spangles of Bullion Golde, and thei daunsed with Ladies sadly, and
cōmuned not with the ladies after the fassion of Maskers, but behaued
theimselfes sadly. Wherefore the quene plucked of their visours, and
then appered the duke of Suffolk, the erle of Essex, the Marques Dorset,
the lorde Burgainy, sir Richard Wyngfeld, sir Robert Wyngfelde,
sir Richard Weston, sir Willyam Kyngston: all these wer sōwhat aged,
the youngest man was fi

se these auncient persones Maskers. When thei wer departed, the kyng
and the foure hostages of Fraunce, and the erle of Deuonshire with .vi.
other young gentlemen entered the chamber, of the whiche sixe wer al in
yelowe sattin, hosen, shoen, and cappes, and sixe other wer in like maner
in Grene: the yelowe sattin was freted with siluer of Damaske, and so
was the grene very richely to behold: and then euery Masker toke a ladie
and daunsed: and when thei had daunsed &amp; commoned a great while
their visers wer taken of, and then the ladies knewe thē, &amp; there the king
gaue many brooches &amp; proper giftes to the ladies. And after this doen,
the quene made a banket to the kyng &amp; his lordes and thother strāgers.
               In the moneth of Nouember, the kyng came from Lambith to Westminster
hall, and so to the starre chamber, and there were before hym the
the Lorde Ogle, the Lorde Haward, sir Mathew Broune, sir Willyam
Bulmer, and Ihon Skot of Camerwell, for diuerse riottes, misdemeanors
and offēces, and especially the kyng rebuked sir William Bulmer
knight, because he beyng the kynges seruaunt sworne, refused the kynges
seruice, &amp; became seruaunt to the duke of Buckingham, saiyng: that
he would none of his seruauntes should hang on another mannes 
                     •
                   sleue,
and that he was aswel able to maintein him as the duke of Buckynghā,
and that what might be thought by his departyng, and what might bee
supposed by y• dukes retainyng, he would not then declare. The knight
kneled still on his knees criyng the kyng mercie, and neuer a noble man
there durst entreate for hym, y• kyng was so highly displeased with hym
Yet at the last when other matters wer hard, the kyng moued with pitie
forgaue thesaid sir Willyam his offence, saiyng, that wee will that none
of our seruauntes shalbe long to any other person, but to vs, nor we wil
not that our subiectes repine or grudge at suche as wee fauoure, for our
pleasure we wil haue in that ca
                     •
                  e as vs liketh, for one we wil fauor now
and another at suche tyme as vs shall like: and therefore sir Willyam if
you serue vs hartely, you shall not be forgotten, &amp; for this tyme we pardon
you. Likewise he pardoned the lorde Edmōd Haward, and sir Mathew

Browne th

of bearynges of diuerse misdoers within the countie of Surrey:
but the lorde Ogle humbly beseched the kyng of his mercie to whom he
answered. Sir your matter concerneth murder of our subiecte, whiche
greate offence is not onely to vs but to God, and therfore we remit you
to the common lawe. And then he rose and went to his barge, and by the
waie he made Iames Yarfford Maior of the Citee of London knight,
and so he with all his counsaill came to Lambeth.
               The .iiii. gentlemen hostages of Fraunce, daily resorted to the courte

Frenche kyng their Master, whom thei preised highly, affirmyng that if
the king &amp; he might once familierly common together, that there should
suche a constant loue rise and encreace betwene theim, whiche afterward
should neuer faile. This request was often tymes hard and litle regarded,
but yet by the meanes of the Cardinall at the last, in the ende of February
it was agreed that the kyng in person, should passe the sea to his
castle and lord

Guisnes and Arde, the kyng and the Frenche kyng should mete. When
this was fully concluded, the kyng wrote letters to all suche lordes, ladies,
gentlemen and Gentlewomen as should geue their attendaunce

               Then were sent to Guysnes vnder the rule of sir Edward Belknay
three .M. artificers, whiche buylded out of the yearth on the plain before
the castle of Guysnes, y• moste goodlyest palaice of timber that euer was
wrought in thesame place, and so curiously garnished without &amp; within
Beside this, prouisions wer made within the realme of England and in
Flaunders for vitaill, wine and all other thynges necessary for thesame.

was made by Clarenseaux kyng of Armes of Englande, in the Courte
of Fraunce, and in the courte of Burgoyn, and in diuerse other courtes
and places in Almain, and Italy. For furnishyng of Iustes, there was
deuised a tilte and all thynges necessary for that enterprice, in a goodly
plain betwene Guysnes and Arde.
               Duryng the tyme of these preparacions, newes were brought to the
king that Charles his nephew elected Emperor of Almain would shortly

                  epart out of Spain by sea, and come by Englande to go into Germany
to receiue his firste Croune at Acon. Wherefore the kyng caused
great prouisions to be made at euery hauē, for the receiuyng of his welbeloued
nephew and frend, and daily prouisions wer made on all sides,

for these noble metynges of so high princes: and especially the quene of
Englande, and the Lady dowager of Fraunce, made greate cost on the
apparell of their ladies and gentlewomen.

the Quenes Chamber foure gentlemen appareled in long and large

a bill to the kyng, the effects whereof was that the .iiii. gentlemen present
would for the loue of their ladies answer al commers at the tilt at a day
by the kyng to be appoynted: whiche daie was appoynted at shrofetide
next ensuyng. At whiche daie y• forsaid gentlemen valiantly accōplished
their entreprice, with greate laudes of the kyng, the quene and ladies.
               In this yere the kyng beyng infourmed, that his realme of Irelande
was out of ordre, discharged the erle of Kildare of his office of deputie,
and therunto (by the meanes of the Cardinall as men thought) was appoynted
therle of Surrey lorde Admirall, to whō the Cardinall did not
owe the best fauor. Wherfore thesaied erle of Surrey in the beginnyng
of Aprill, tooke leaue of the kyng, and the duke of Norffolke his father,
and passed into Irelande, and had with him diuerse gentlemen, that had
been in the garrison of Tourney, and one hundred yomen of the kynges

manhod and wisedom, brought the erle of Desmonde and diuerse other
rebelles, to good conformitie and ordre: and there he continued in great
hardnes two yere and more, in whiche space he had many battailes and
skirmishes with the wylde Irishe.
               When it was concluded that the kynges of Englande and Fraunce

Grenewiche with the noble knightes of the Garter in robes of the order
               The kyng intendyng and perseueryng in purpose to mete with Frances
the Frenche kyng, greate and riche prouisions were made, wherfore
the noble Kyng and the Quene with all the noble courte, remoued the
twentie and one daie of Man beyng on Mundaie, from their maner of
Grenewyche, towardes the Sea side, and so on the Fridaie beeyng the
twentie and fiue daie of Maij, arriued at the citee of Cantorbury, intendyng
there to kepe his Pentecoste.
               Sone after whiche cominyng to Cantorbury, tidynges wer brought
that Charles Emperor electe, was on the sea, in sight of the coast of Englande,
wherefore officers of the kyng were sent with greate diligence to
the Castle and toune of Douer, to be there in a redines against the arriuall
of the Emperor.
               The reuerent father in God my lorde Cardinall, came to the toune of
Douer in hast with a noble repaire, abidyng the commyng of the Emperour,
whiche Emperour, the Saterdaie beyng the .xxvi. daie of Ma
                     ••
                  
arriued with all his nauie of shippes royall on the coast of Kent, directe
to the toune or porte of Hieth thesaied daie by noone, where he was hailed
by the noble knight sir Willyam Fitzwillyam, vice admirall of Englande,
with sixe of the kynges shippes well furnished, whiche laye for
the safegarde of passage betwene Douer and Caleis, at the costes and
charges of the kyng of Englande. Calmenes of the wether and lacke of
wynde, caused that the Emperoure might not so sone take lande at the
porte of Douer, as he would haue dooen. Notwithstandyng towardes
the euen he departed from his shippes, and entered into his boate commyng
towardes the lande, where in his commyng to the land▪ on the sea
the reuerent father lorde Wolsay Cardinall and Legate, mette and receiued
hym with suche reuerence, as to so noble a Prince apperteigned.
Thus landed the Emperoure Charles, vnder the clothe of his estate of
the blacke Egle all splaied on riche clothe of golde. In his retinue with
hym, were many noble menne, and many faire Ladies of his bloud as
princes and princesses, &amp; one ladie as chief to bee noted, was the princes

Auinion with many other nobles whiche landed with hym in high and
sumptuous maner and great riches in their apparell: greate ioye made
the people of England to see the Emperour, and more to see the benyng
maner and mekenes of so high a prince.
               Then when the Emperour thus had taken lande, the reuerente father
lord Cardynall was as conducte to thesame noble Emperour from the
shore of Douer vnto the castell there: then were all persons chered, the
best that there in the towne might be.
               After the departyng of Themperour to the lande from his nauy, the
apparell of euery ship then shewed, as flagges, banners, stremers, &amp; targetes,
then the mighty ordinaunce of euery of them brake oute by force
of fyer as though the see had brente, maruelous was the noyse of the
gonnes.
               The Emperour beyng thus in the castell of Douer, with hast tidynges
came to the kyng where as he was at Cantorbury, who hasted hym
towards the noble Emperour. And so came riding early in the morning
to the castell of Douer, within which castell the kyng alighted: the Emperour
heryng the kyng to be come, came out of his chamber to mete wt
the kyng, and so met with him on the stayres or he coulde come vp, whereche
embraced other right louingly: then y• kyng brought the Emperour
to hys chamber, where as there communyng was of gladnes.
               Sone after these two noble princes on the Whitsonday early in the
morenynge tooke their horse and rode to the Cytee of Cantorbury, the
more to solempne the feast of Pentecost, but specially to see the quene of
England his aunte was the intent of the Emperour.
               The noble personages of the realme of England and the quene with
her beautiful trayne of ladies receiued and welcommed the same Charles
elect Emperour, whose person was by the kyng cōueighed to a faire
and pleasant chamber where thesayde Emperour apparelled hym right
richely. Then the noble retynue of thesayde Emperour aswell of lordes
as ladyes were lodged, aswell as there myght be, with ioye and muche
gladnes, and there in Cantorbury soiorned the Emperour and all hys
trayne with the kyng, vntill the Thursdaye in thesame weke.
               The last daye of May beyng Thursday, the Emperour toke leaue of
the kyng &amp; of all the ladyes, and gaue great thankes, and so rode to Sā
                  dewiche,
and there toke his shippes, the wynd to hym was likyng, wherby
he sayled into Flaunders.
               Then thesame daye, the kyng of Englande made saile from the porte
of Douer and with noble apparaile londed at Calys at the hower of .xi.
of the clock, and with hym the quene and ladyes and many nobles of y•
realme. And so was the kyng receiued into the Checker and there rested:
great repayre of noble men came to the towne of Caleys from y• French
court, to se the kyng and to salute him, whiche were of his grace, princely
entretayned.
               Mondaye the .iiii. daye of Iune the kynges grace with all the nobles

aswell the quene with her trayne of ladyes as other, with all the whole
nōber of nobles remoued from Calis to his lordship royall of Guisnes
into the most noble and royall lodgyng before sene, for it was a palays,
the palays was quadrant, and euery quadrant of thesame palays was
iii.C.xxviii. foote longe of a syse, which was in compasse .xiii.C. and .xii.

sumpteous woorke. At the enteryng into the palays before the

               On the other hande or syde of the gate, was set a pyller with was of
auncient Romayne woorke borne with .iiii. Lyons of golde, the pyllers
wrapped in a wrethe of golde curiously wroughte and intrayled, and on
the sommet of thesayde pyller stode an image of the blynde God Cupide
with his bowe and arrowes of loue redy by his semyng, to Stryke the
younge people to loue.
               The forgate of thesame palays or place with greate and mighty masonry

well and warly was made ouer the gate loups, and enforced with battaylementes
and in thesame gate a lodge for the porter: whyche there
apered and other, sumpteously apparayled lyke vnto kynges officers.
               By thesame gate, all people passed into a large courte fayre &amp; beautiful,

for from the firste water table to the raysyng or resun pieces, was bay

               On euery hande was there chamber doores and enterynges into the

               Also in the firste Closet was a trauerse for the kynges person of cloth

of clothe of golde: before the trauerse was an altare of presence, whiche
Aultare was adourned with clothe of brouderie, and riche Pearles and

was a deske or halpace, whereon stoode a patible of the Cruci

twelue other Images all fine golde and precious stones, twoo paire of

                     •
                  hesaied Closet was hanged with Tappettes embraudered

                  napar and Bice.
               The seconde Closette was for the Quenes persone, in whiche was a
trauerse of riche clothe of golde, the aultare so richely appareled, that
there lacked neither Pearles nor Stones of riches: on the aultare were

all other iewelles Missall, I suppose neuer suche like were seen, and the
rooffe of thesame closet was siled with like worke that the kynges closet
was, as is before rehersed.
               And from this palaice or place into the mightie and strong fotresse
and Castle royall of 
                     •
                  uisnes, was a galery for the secrete passage of the
kynges persone into a secrete lodgyng within thesame Castle the more
for the kynges ease.
               Also to this palaice was all houses of offices, that to suche an honourable
Courte should apperteigne, that is to wete, the lorde Chamberlaine,
lorde Steward▪ lorde Thresourer of the houshold, for the Comptroller
and office of grene Clothe, Wardroppes, Iuell house, and office
of houshold seruice, as Ewery, Pantrie, Seller, Buttery, Spicery, pitcher
house, Larder and Poultrie, and all other offices so large and faire
that the officers might and did marueiles, as in the craft of viandes, by
Ouens, harthes, reredorses, Chimnayes, Ranges, and suche instrumentes
that there was ordained. In this Palaice as ye haue heard, was the
kinges grace lodged and al the nobles after their degrees. And for that
the toune of Guysnes was litle, and that all the noble menne might not
there be lodged, thei sette vp tentes in the felde, to the nomber of twentie
and eight hundred sundery lodgynges, whiche was a goodly sighte.
Thus was the kyng in his Palais royall at Guysnes.
               
                  FRAVNCES the Frenche kyng was with all his nobles of the realme
of Fraunce, come to the toune of Arde, whiche was prepared for his cō
                  myng

many tentes, hales and pauilions, were set and pight in the felde.
On the French partie also, there was at thesame toune of Arde buylded
the Frenche kynges lodgyng full well, but not finished, muche was the
prouisions in Picardy on euery part through all. The French kyng cō
                  maunded
his lodgyng to be made, a litle out of the toune of Arde in the
territorie of an old castle, whiche by the war of old tyme had been beatē.
On thesame place was edified a house of solas and sporte, of large and
mightie compas, whiche was chiefly sustained by a great mightie maste,
wherby the greate ropes and takell strained, thesame maste was staied.
All the roffe of thesame house hong on thesame Maste, and with takell
was strained and borne, by the supporters of thesame Maste or tree, the
colours of thesame was all blewe, set with starres of gold foyle, and the
Orbes of the heauens by the crafte of colours in the roffe, were curiosly
wrought in maner like the sky, or firmamēt, and a cresant strained sumdell
towardes the toune of Arde, this cresant was couered with frettes
and knottes made of Iue busshes, and boxe braunches, and other thynges
that longest would be grene for pleasure.
               In this tyme the reuerent father lorde Thomas Wolsay Cardinall
and legate a Latere as the kynges high ambassador rode with noble repaire
or lordes, gentlemen &amp; prelates to the toune of Arde, to the French
courte where of the Frenche kyng, thesame lorde Cardinall was highly
enterteined. Of the noblenes of this Cardinall, the Frenchemen made
bokes, shewyng the triumphant dooynges of the Cardinalles royaltie.
The nomber of the gentlemen, knightes and lordes all in crimosyn veluet,
with the marueilous nomber of chames of golde, the greate Horse,
Mules, Coursers, and cariages, that there were, whiche went before the
Cardinalles cōmyng into Arde with sumters and cofers. Of his great
Crosses and Pillers borne, the pillowe bere or cace broudered, the twoo
mantelles, with other the Ceremoniall Offices, with greate and honourable
nomber of bishoppes geuyng their attendaunce, the mightie and
greate nomber of seruauntes, as yomen, gromes, all clothed in Scarlet
who so redeth of the Frenche boke, shall finde wonderfully set furthe.
               The kyng of Englande beeyng at the Castle of Guysnes in the newe
palais, many noble men of the Frenche court resorted to his grace, to se
the kyng of Englande and the quene, and to salute thē: who of the kyng
of Englande were well entertained.
               When the lorde Cardinall had soiourned at Arde in the French court
by the space of twoo daies, and the high and vrgent princely causes in
counsaill declared, the lorde Cardinal toke his leaue of the French kyng
and of all the Frenche courte, and repaired vnto the Castle of Guysnes,
where he founde the kyng of Englande his souereigne Lorde. And thesame
kyng by his letters patentes, had geuen full power and aucthoritie
to thesame lorde Cardinall, concernyng all matters to bee debated,
touchyng the kyng and the realme, and also gaue vnto thesame Cardinall,
full strength, power, and aucthoritie, to affirme and confirme, bynd

and vnbynde, whatsoeuer should bee in question, betwene hym and the
Frenche kyng, as though the kyng in proper person had been there presently.
               When the lordes of the Frenche counsaill, sawe the high and greate
aucthoritie that the Cardinall had, thei shewed it vnto the Frēch kyng,
who incontinent commaunded his commission to be made, of like power
and aucthoritie, that the kyng of Englāde had geuen vnto thesaid lorde
Cardinall: thesame power and aucthoritie had thesame reuerent father,
geuen to him by Fraunces the Frenche kyng, and affirmed by the counsaill
royall of Fraunce: Then hastely was sent to the kyng of Englande
the Frenche kynges patent, for the lorde Cardinall saied humbly to the
Frenche kyng, that he would no suche power receiue, without the consent
of the kyng of Englande his souereigne Lorde: but when the kyng
of Englande and his counsaill, had seen and vewed the Frenche kynges
Patent, and it well considered, then he sent thesame Patent of power to
the lorde Cardinall with full assent: then the lorde Cardinall the power
receiued with muche gladnes. It was highly estemed &amp; taken for greate
loue that the Frenche Kyng had geuen so greate power to the Kyng of
Englandes subiect.
               Thursdaie the seuenth day of Iune, in the vale of Andren, within the
lordeship royall of Guysnes, before daie was set and pight a royall rich
tent, all or clothe of gold, and riche embroudery of the kyng of Englandes,
and diuerse other hales and pauilions: thesame riche tente of gold,
was within hanged of the richest Arras, newly cōtriued and made, that
euer before was seen, and a presence of the kynges estate, with two chayers
and riche cusshyns therein: the ground was spred with Carpettes,
of newe Turkey makyng, all full of beautie.
               But here is to be noted, that in this meane season in all the feldes about,
bothe nigh and far, wer many of the Frenche gard, ridyng and beholdyng
the maner of the Englishe parte, some of the kynges gard, and
some of the duke of Burbons gard, and some of the Admirall of Fraū
                  ces
Gard, whiche slily marked the conueighaunce of the people of Englande.
At the houre of metyng appoynted, the Lordes of Englande set
their people and seruauntes in good arraie of battaill, in a plain felde
directly before the castle of Guysnes. The kyng of Englande commaū
                  ded
that his Garde should bee set in the breste of the battaill, or bend of
footemen, and so it was doen. This battaill of footemen conducted thē
                  selfes
so in ordre, that from the firste to the laste, neuer a persone of the
footemen brake his place or arraie, but kepte theimselfes so well, that
neuer seruyng menne theimselfes better demeaned. The seruyng menne
thus set in ordre in the felde, on the left hande of the kyng of Englande,
somewhat towarde the Marres, long while thus abidyng, in whiche
tyme the Castle of Guysnes shot a warnyng pece to the toune of Arde,
and in likewyse the Toune of Arde gaue warnyng to the Castle of
Guysnes.
               
                  Now was gathered the Frenche Kynges repaire, and by the Lorde
Marshall and Constable of Fraunce, the Lordes and gentlemen were
set in ordre: thus bothe these twoo high and mightie princes, intendyng
to mete and assemble many woordes and tales, and suspect demeanynges
arose in the Englishe partie, for the great loue that we the Englishemen
had to our Prince, caused the ignoraunt people that were not worthy
to knowe the pretence of princes, to suspecte the Frenche partie, and
the more because that Monsire Chatelion a Lorde of Fraunce, in rigorous
and cruel maner, threwe doune foure pennons of white and grene
whiche wer set by Richard Gibson, by commaundement from the kyng
for the suer marke or metyng place of the twoo kynges in what ground
thei should encounter, wordes rose betwene Monsire Chatelion and Richarde
Gibson, as farre as became for that deede, but at the commaundement
of the erle Marshall for that tyme, whiche was the noble erle of
Essex, the kyng of Englandes cosyn, that wrong by vs Englishemenne
was paciently suffered, thus from tyme to tyme, and watche to watche,
and vewe to vewe, the houre drewe nere, that was by bothe the Princes
appoynted, of metyng or encountre.
               Wherefore the kyng of Englande our souereigne Lorde, with all the
Court of nobles of Englande mounted on horsebacke, and marched towardes
the valey of Andern in honourable ordre, all Gentle menne,
Squiers, Knightes, and Barons, roade before the kyng and bishoppes
also, the dukes, Marques and Erles, gaue attendaunce next the kyng.
He were muche wise that could haue tolde or shewed of the riches of apparell
that was emongest the Lordes and Gentlemenne of Englande,
Clothe of Golde, Clothe of Siluer, Ueluettes, Tinsins, Sattins embroudered,
and Crymosyn Sattens: The marueilous threasor of golde
that was worne in Chaynes and Bauderickes, so greate, so weightie,
some so manifolde, some in Colers of. S. greate, that the Golde was
innumerable to my demyng to bee summed, of all noble menne, Gentlemenne,
Squiers, Knightes, and euery honest Officer of the Kyng was
richely appareled, and had Chaynes of Golde, greate and meruelous
waightie: what should bee saied? surely emong the Englishemenne lacked
no riches, nor beautifull apparell or aray, and alwaies as the kyng
of Englande and his horsemen marched, so pace for pace marched the
moste goodly battaill or bend of foote men (out of defensable apparell)
that euer I trowe before was seen.
               The Frenche kyng on his partie marched towardes the encountre
with all the ruffelers and gallantes of the Frenche Courte. In whiche
tyme came to the Frenche kyng some reporte, that caused hym to tarry,
and a light from his Horse, then the Frenche menne were very doubtfull,
and in a staye so still rested, vntill a Lorde of Fraunce called Monsire
Morret, thesaied Morret came to the Frenche Kyng, and shewed
hym the very fidelitie of the Kyng of Englande, whereby the Frenche
kyng mounted on horsebacke, and the better couraged, marched towardes

the place appoynted of encountre.
               Thus in marchyng thone kyng to the other, to the kyng of England
came lorde George Neuell lorde Aburgheny, and openly saied, sir ye be
my kyng and souereigne, wherefore aboue all I am bounden to shewe
you truthe, and not to let for none, I haue been in the Frenche partie,
and thei be mo in nomber, double so many, as ye bee: with that was the
Erle of Shrewesbery Lorde Stewarde ready and saied, sir, whatsoeuer
my Lorde of Burgheny saieth, I my selfe haue been there, and the
Frenchemenne bee more in feare of you and youre subiectes, then youre
subiectes bee of them, wherefore saied the Erle, if I wer worthie to geue
counsaill, your grace should marche forwarde, so we intende my Lorde
saied the kyng: then the Officers of Armes cried on afore, then in shorte
while was the kyng on the banke of Andern: then euery gentleman as
thei roade toke his place, and stoode still side by side, their regard or face
towardes the vale of Andern.
               Then the kyng of Englande shewed hymself somedele forwarde in
beautie and personage, the moste goodlicit Prince that euer reigned ouer
the Realme of Englande: his grace was apparelled in a garment
of Clothe of Siluer, of Damaske, ribbed with Clothe of Golde, so
thicke as mighte bee, the garment was large, and plited verie thicke,
and canteled of very good intaile, of suche shape and makyng, that it
was marucilous to beholde. The Courser whiche his grace roade on,
was Trapped in a marueilous vesture of a newe deuised fashion, the
Trapper was of fine Golde in Bullion, curiously wroughte, pounced
and sette with anticke woorke of Romayne Figures. Attendyng on the
kynges grace of Englande, was the Master of his horse, by name Sir
Henry Guylford, leadyng the kynges spare horse, the whiche horse was
Trapped in a Mantellet bront and backe place, all of fine gold in Scifers,
of deuice with Tasselles on Cordelles pendaunt, the Sadell was
of thesame sute and woorke, so was the hedde stall and raynes. After folowed
nyne henxce menne, ridyng on Coursers of Naples, thesame
young Gentlemen were appareled in riche Clothe of Tissue, the Coursers
in Harneis of marueilous fashion, scaled in fine Golde in Bullion,
and workes subtile more then my sighte could contriue, and all thesame
horse Harneis were sette full of tremblyng spanges that were large and
faire. The lorde Marques Dorset bare the kynges sweard of estate before
the kynges grace, the reuerent father Lorde Cardinall did his attendaunce.
               Thus in litle tyme, abidyng the commyng of the Frenche kyng and
his, the whiche in shorte tyme came with greate nomber of horsemenne,
freshely appareled, the Frenche Kyng and his retayne, put themselfes in
place appoynted, direct against the Englishe partie, beholdyng euery other
of bothe nacions, the Frenche menne mused muche of the battaill
of the foote menne, and euery of the Frenche menne to other spake of the

multitude of the Englishe menne whiche semed greate, yet were not thei
so many as the Frenche partie.
               When the Frenche kyng had a litle beholden the Englishe menne, he
put hymself somewhat before his people, that were there on hym attendaunt,
the Duke of Burbon bearyng a naked Swearde vpright, the
Lorde Admirall of Fraunce, and the Countie Cosmen Galias, Master
of the Frenche kynges horse, and no mo persones gaue their attendance
in passyng with the Frenche kyng: when it was perceiued that the Frēch
kynges swearde was borne naked, then the kyng of England commaū
                  ded
the lorde Marques Dorset to drawe out the swearde of estate, and
beare it vp naked in presence, whiche was so doen.
               Then vp blewe the Trumpettes, Sagbuttes, Clarions, and all other
Minstrelles on bothe sides, and the kynges descended doune towarde
the bottome of the valey of Andern, in sight of bothe the nacions
and on horsebacke met and embrased the twoo kynges eache other: then
the two kinges alighted, and after embrased with benyng and curteous
maner eche to other, with swete and goodly wordes of gretyng: and after
sewe woordes, these twoo noble kynges went together into the riche
tente of clothe of golde, that there was set on the grounde for suche purpose,
thus arme in arme went the Frenche kyng Fraunces the firste of
Fraunce, and Henry the eight kyng of Englande and of Fraunce, together
passyng with communicacion.
               When the twoo princes were in the tente, before rehersed, the Frenche
Kyng saied, my dere brother and Cosyn, thus farre to my paine haue I
trauailed to se you personally, I thynke verely that you esteme me as I
am. And that I mai
                     •
                   to you bee your aide, the realmes and seigniories
shewe the might of my persone: Sir said the kyng of Englande, neither
your realmes nor other the places of your power, is the matter of my regarde,
but the stedfastnes and loyall kepyng of promesse, comprised in
Charters betwene you and me: that obserued and kepte, I neuer sawe
Prince with my iyen, that might of my harte bee more loued. And for
your loue I haue passed the seas, into the fardest frontier of my realme
to se you presently, the whiche dooyng now gladdeth me. And then were
the twoo Kynges serued with a banket, and after mirthe, had communicacion
in the Banket tyme, and there shewed the one the other their
pleasure.
               The Englishe officers went and ranne with greate pottes of Wyne,
and Bolles to the Frenche menne, and theim chered the best that might
bee, all this season stoode still the noble men of the Englishe partie, and
all other, and from their places moued nothyng that thei were appointed
vnto. And the seruyng men in likewise, not once moued from their
ground or standyng, but the Frenchemen sodainly brake, and many of
them came into the Englishe partie, speakyng faire, but for all that, the
courte of Englande and the lordes, kept still their arraie.
               After the twoo kynges had ended the banket, and spice and wyne geuen

to the Frenchemen, Ipocras was chief drinke of plentie, to all that
would drinke. In open sight then came the two kynges, that is to were:
the Frenche kyng, and he kyng of England, out of their tent, by whiche
I then well perceiued thabiliment royall of the Frenche kyng, his garment
was a chemew, of clothe of siluer, culpond with clothe of golde, of
damaske cantell wise, and garded on the bordours with the Burgon
bendes, and ouer that a cloke of broched satten, with gold of purple coloure,
wrapped aboute his body trauerse, beded from the shulder to the
waste, fastened in the lope of the first fold: this said cloke was richely set
with pearles and precious stones: this Frenche kyng had on his hed a
koyfe of damaske gold set with diamondes, and his courser that he rode
on was couered with a trapper of Tissue, broudered with deuise, cut in
fashion mātell wise, the skirtes were embowed &amp; fret with frised worke, &amp;
knit with Cordelles, &amp; buttons tasseled of Turkey makyng, Raines and
hedstall, answeryng of like woorke: and verely of his persone thesame
Fraunces the Frenche kyng, a goodly Prince, stately of countenaunce,
mery of chere, broune coloured, great iyes, high nosed, bigge lipped, faire
brested and shoulders, small legges, and long fete.
               All the nobles of the Frenche courte, were in garmentes of many colours,
so that thei were not knowen from the braggery: thus as the two
kynges wer in communicacion, diuerse noble men of Englande wer called
to presence. And then the twoo kynges departed with their compaignie,
the kyng of Englande to Guysnes, the Frenche kyng to Arde.
               Saterdaie the .ix. daie of Iune in a place within the Englishe pale,
were set and pight in a felde, called the campe, two trees of muche honor
the one called the Aub
                        •
                     spine, and the other called the Framboister, whiche
is in English the Hathorne, whiche was Henry, and the Raspis berry
for Fraunces, after the significacion of the Frenche: these twoo trees
were mixed one with the other together on a high mountaigne, couered
with grene Damaske, thesame Trees were artificially wrought, resemblyng
the nature of thesame as nigh as could be, the leaues were grene
Damaske, the braunches, bowes, and withered leaues of clothe of gold,
and all the bodies and armes of thesame clothe of golde, laied on tymber,
thei were in heigth frō the foote to the toppe .xxxiiii. foote of assise▪ in
compasse aboute an hundred twentie and nyne foote, and from bough to
bough, fourtie and three foote: on these trees were flowers and fruites,
wrought in kyndly wise with siluer and Uenice gold, their beautie shewed
farre: on the mountaigne was a place ha
                     •
                  ber wise, where the Herrauldes
were, the mountaigne was rayled about, and the railes couered
with grene Damaske.
               Thesame daie the twoo noble kynges came to thesame trees of honor
with greate triumph, accompaignied with diuerse nobles and yong valiauntes,
before whom were their shildes caried, and after borne aboute
the listes, and set on the highest place, shewyng into the feldes, the kyng
of Englandes armes within a Gartier, and the Frenche kynges within

a Coller of his ordre of sainct Michael, with a close Croune, with a Flower
delice in the toppe. The Campe was in length nyne hundred foote,
and in bredth three hundred and twentie foote, ditched rounde aboute,
sauyng at the entrees with broade and depe diches, diuerse skaffoldes
were tered aboute this Campe, for the ease of the nobles: on the rightside
of the felde stood the quene of Englande, and the quene of Fraunce
with many ladies. Thesame Campe was railed and bard on euery ende
strongly, there was twoo lodgynges in the entery of thesame felde, for
the twoo kynges richely adourned, whiche were vnto theim very necessarie,
for therein thei armed theimselfes and tooke their ease: also in thesame
compasse was twoo greate Sellers couched full of wyne, whiche
was to all men as larges
                        •
                     e as the fountain.
               The cause of the settyng vp of the twoo greate shieldes with armes
Royall, was for ioye of the honourable metyng, there to passe the tyme
from idlenes, with the exercise of noble feactes of Armes in honoure, articles
of Iustes, Turnayes, battailes on foote at the Barres, and suche
victorious feactes were 
                     •
                  arre in Realmes Proclaimed, whiche caused
muche people of noble courage thether to resorte: the twoo kynges as
brethren in armes, vndertoke to deliuer all personages of thesame feactes,
and to thesame twoo kynges by the ordre of armes were 
                     •
                  ociate,
the Duke of Uendosme, the duke of Suffolke, the countie sainct Paule
the Marques Dorset, Monsire de Roche, sir Willyam Kyngston, Mō
                  sire
Brian, sir Richard Garnyngham, Monsire Cauaan, sir Giles Capell,
Monsire Bukkall, Master Nicholas Carewe, Monsire Mountafilion,
and Master Anthony Kneuet, the shieldes of all these nobles wer
hanged on the trees, with thre tables of the Chalenges, to the whiche all
noble menne that would answere, brought in their shieldes to thesame
trees, and theim presented to the kynges of Armes, and to the Articles
wrote with their handes.
               Mondaie the .xi. daie of Iune, the twoo Quenes of Englande and of
Fraunce came to the campe, where either saluted other right honorably,
and went into a stage for them prepared, right curiously hanged, &amp; specially
there was for the quene of Englande, a Tapet all of pearle called
Huges Dike, whiche was muche loked at for the costlynes of thesame.
               At the houre assigned, the two kynges armed at all peces mounted on
horsebacke, on them attendyng the noble persones, parteners of the chalenge:
the Frenche kyng sette hymself on a Courser barded, couered with
Purple sattin, broched with golde, and embraudered with Corbyns fethers
round and buckeled, the fether was blacke and hached with gold.
Corbyn is a Rauen, and the firste silable of Corbyn is Cor, whiche is a
harte, a penne in English, is a fether in Frenche, and signifieth pain, &amp; so
it stode, this fether round was endles, the buckels wherwith the fethers
wer fastened, betokeneth sothfastnes, thus was the deuise, harte fastened
in pain endles, or pain in harte fastened endles: on his hed pece he bare
a sleue, all the partenars of the Frenche kynges chalenge were in like

apparell, euery thyng correspondent in clothe of silke embroudered, on
his persone were attendant on horsebacke noble persones, and on foote

put these two together and it maketh libera me, the chayne betokeneth

great strokes of the kynges, to their honor: when these bendes were deliuered,
the Heraldes cryed a lostel and the princes them disarmed and
went to lodgyng.
               Saterday, the .xvii. day of Iune the Frenche kyng with a small nō

was a great bed of like worke, from whence he was conueighed into another

hanged and siled with clothe of gold, enbrodered with great cordelles
or friers knottes of cloth of siluer. In thesame chambre were two cupbordes
on either side one, furnished with great and goodly plate gilte.
Noble feastyng &amp; there was there made. After dyner the ladies dressed
them to daunce, the kyng the more to glad the quene &amp; the sayd ladies,
departed secretly and put himself with .xxix. persones more in Maskers

               Then was there another compaignie of .x. lordes in whiche maskery
the kyng was himselfe, apparelled all in long garmentes of estate all

toke ladies and daunsed, in passyng the tyme right honorably.
Then at thinstance of the Frenche quene and her ladies these maskers

Then spices, fruites, ielies, and banket viandes wer brought, that done

toune of Arde, into the felde or campe.
               But now to tell of the feast and riches royal that was in the presēce
of the Frenche kyng in the newe palaice royal. This daie the quene of
England receiued the Frenche kyng wt all honor that was accordyng.
In presēce larked neither clothes of estate nor other riches, for to shewe
the multitude of siluer and golde in plate and vessell there that daie, it
were impossible: for all noble men were serued in gilte vessel, and all other
in siluer vessell. When the Frenche kyng had washed and in his

wer serched and sought through countreys for the delicacie of viādes:

               Mondaie the .xviii. day of Iune, there blew suche stormes of wynd &amp;
wether that meruail was to heare, for which hideous tēpest some said it

was a very ꝓnosticacion of trouble &amp; hatred to come betwene princes.

               The kyng of England was ready &amp; strake his horse with the spurres
&amp; so fiersly rāne to the countre partie that his graund graue gard was
lose with the great stroke that the kyng gaue him: course after course ye
kyng lost none, but euermore he brake his spere and so nobly ended his
Iustes royal, for this daie ended the kinges great chalenge, and of the
kyng our souereigne lordes doynges, all men there that him beheld reported

renoumed. The Frenche kyng on his part ranne valiantly breakyng
speares egrely and so well ended his chalenge of Iustes, that he ought
euer to be spoken of. When the bend of the Duke of Burbon was of
their pretence of chalenge deliuered, thei toke leaue and departed.

                        〈◊〉
                      perill, this was the deuise, so was the kyng of
England apparelled and all his parteners of chalenge.
               The quene of Fraunce and the quene of England were in the places

Burbon and .xvii. men of armes, al wel and warlike horsed and armed
and euery of these bendes after their deuises apparelled right richely.
               The .ii. noble kynges were ready and either of them encountred one
man of armes, the Frenche kyng to the erle of Deuonshire, the kyng of
England to Mounsire Florenges. The kyng of England bare backe
Mounsire Florenges and brake his Poldron &amp; him disarmed, when ye
strokes were striken, this battail was departed, it was muche praised.
Then on went swordes &amp; doune went visers, there was litle abidyng.
Sir Iohn Neuell, Master Fraunces Bryan, sir Rouland, and master
Robart Garnyngham were this day as aydes sor ye hurt persones that
before were of the entertaine, and fought feruently battail after battail
and none ceased till they all that would entre were deliuered of their
pretence in chalenge royall pretenced. This day was the chalenge of
Turnays after the articles ended, and all noble men deliuered and so
departed the felde: then the kinges rode about the felde as honor of armes
required, and the Herauldes cried la fine des Turnayes, by the sayd
two noble princes the .xxi. daie of Iune.
               Fryday the .xxii. day of Iune in the campe was sette a barrier for to
fight on foote, also an Hale of the kynges of England was sette in
the same place, enbrodered with cloudes of blewe, and out of the
cloudes the Sunne risyng, the valence of the same was written in
letters of blewe enbrodered, dieu er men droit, in whiche Hale the
Lordes and other of the entertaine of the chalenge armed theimselfes.
               Nowe was the noble Kynges readye to do battail on foote at
the Barriers, the Quenes on their stages: then entered bend after
bend on foote and preased to the Barriers, euery one in his hande
a Punchion spere, wherewith without any abode foyned and lashed
alwayes one at another, two for two as the lotte fell. When the
speres were, spent, then swordes to theim were geuen. Then preased
to the Barriers the two valiant kynges, and other, then was no tariyng
but fought with suche force that the fyer sprang out of their armure.
Thus bend after bend they were all deliuered by the two noble
kynges and their aydes of retaine.
               
                  Then in came a bend with two hande swordes and castyng dartes
to answere to that chalenge, .xii. menne well armed whiche presed to the
barriers &amp; mightely threwe their speares the one to the other, ready or
not ready, none fauored other more then two enemies or at vtterance,
and euer styll two for two, till all were deliuered concernyng the chalenge,
so this same two kinges safe in body and lymmes ended the batbattail
for that day at the barriers with great honor.
               All men of armes passed and departed for that tyme, muche preparacion
was made there, as settyng vp tentes, hales, and other places for
furnishyng of houses of offices and chābers of estates for the kynges
and quenes, &amp; also thesame night was in the campe rered a large frame
of tymber worke for a chapell place, whiche was syled wt riche clothes
enbrodered, wherin was made a stage of two degrees, with the chayre
and cloth of state for the lorde Cardynall, the alter apparelled with all
Iuelles myssall of great riches, thesame chapel thus finished the .xxiii.
day of Iune beyng satterday, at houre conuenient, the sayd lorde Cardinal
sang an high and solempne masse by note before the two kynges
and quenes, thesame done, Indulgence was geuen to all hearers, the
two kynges together associate tooke their chamber. Of this masse in
Flaunders arose muche communicacion, in so muche that the common
voyce went, how the .ii. kynges wer sworne together on the sacrament,
which was contrary, for the masse was for none other entent then to
geue Indulgence to the kynges.
               When tyme was, the two kynges washed and satte to meate vnder
their clothes of estate where they were richely serued, the royaltie of the
fare and the riches of vessell, plate and Iuelles surmounteth the witte
of man to expresse: the quenes in another Chamber wer serued with no
lesse honor, the dyner ended, the sayd straūgers royally apparelled, presented
themselues in places of estate.
               To tell you the apparel of the ladies, their riche attyres, their sumptuous
Iuelles, their diuersities of beauties, and the goodly behauior
from day to day sithe the fyrst metyng, I assure you ten mennes wittes
can scace declare it.
               The two noble kynges put themselfes in armes with their bend and
entered the felde on foote, before the barriers, then entered the bendes
of men of armes in armur right richely, then all was ready and the .ii.
kynges at the barriers ready to fight right nobly. This day was
deliuered at barriers by battail a C. &amp; vi. persones, the .ii. last battailes
did the kynges. The kyng of England with few strokes disarmed his
counter partie, the Frenche kyng likewise bare himselfe right valiantly.
Thus the sayd saterday was fully ended, and all men deliuered of
articles of Iustes and all Turneys and battailes on foote by the sayd
two noble kynges.
               After this chalenge honorably performed, the kynges prepared diuers

maskers and especially the king of England had .iiii. companies,
and in euery companie, x. persones apparelled as you shall heare.
               The fyrst persone of the fyrst .x. was apparelled like Hercules in a
shirte of siluer of damaske written in letters of purple about y• border,
en femes et infauntes cy petit assurance, whiche in Englishe is as muche
to say: In women and children is litle assuraunce: he had on his head a
whode with a garlond of grene damaske cutte into leaues like Uyne
leaues and Hawthorne leaues, in his hand a club couered with grene

in long vestures of calendred cloth of gold and purple clothe of

buskyns of grene damaske.
               Other .x. were apparelled in cotes of crimosyn Satten al ouer couered
with quaterfoyles of clothe of gold, of tissue, and clothe of siluer raised,
the gold was fringed with siluer, and the siluer with gold and layd

mantle or Robe of crimosyn satten enbrodered full of figures of gold,
and on their heades bonettes of stoole worke of golde of damaske, and
euery one had on his viser a berde of golde wyer with whoddes and
buskyns of crimosyn Satten.
               Ten of the ladies were apparelled after the Genowayes fashion, the
ground of their gounes was white satten, ouer diapred with right crimosyn

with him and his sister Quene Marye dowager of Fraunce and .xix.
ladies with her like maskers apparelled as you haue heard, all moūted
on horses trapped in veluet white and yelow, and euermore a lord and
a lady ridyng together, with mynstrelsye departed out of Guysnes on
sonday the .xxiiii. day of Iune and toke their way toward Arde, and in
the way on the banke of Anderne these Maskers met with the Frenche
kyng, beyng in a chariot with .xxxviii. persones richely apparelled in
Maskyng apparell, and eche compaigny passed by other without any
countenaunce makyng or disuiseryng.
               The Frenche kyng and his compaignie went to Guysnes, the kyng
of England to Arde, where his maiestie was receiued into the Frenche
court, and brought into the chamber of riche apparell, where at the instance
of the Frenche Quene the kyng and all his, them disuisered and
shewed theyr faces, and al the ladies of England likewyse, then began
feast &amp; chere to arise, the kyng of England was set, and after al ye ladies
and Maskers of England and were nobly serued of many straunge
meates: After dyner began the daunces in passyng the tyme ioyously.
               The Frenche Maskers apparell was not al of one suite, but of seueral
fashions, of diuers silkes, some cut, some broched, some had plumes
that were very fayre, but very beautifull was the sight.
               The Frenche kyng and his compaignie was then at guisnes where
the quene of Englād met and welcomed them, Then the Frenche kyng
and his Maskers shewed themselfes bare faced, and when the Quene
them sawe she did then the more reuerence. Great was the chere that
then was there. After dyner and daunces done, the Frenche kyng drew
himselfe into a secrete chamber &amp; put from him his apparel of maskery
and toke to him his apparel of vsaunce, in the whiche were many fayre
Emeraudes, this done he toke his leaue of the quene, and on the court
he loked with a high countenaunce and so departed, the lord Cardinal
and the duke of Buckyngham him conductyng, the kyng of England,
this tyme duryng, was at Arde, where he passed the tyme with muche
solas: At tyme conuement he toke leaue of the Frenchemen &amp; all other
of the Frēche court, and after they had visered themselfes they rode nobly
thus apparelled through ye toune of Arde, &amp; so passed till they came
to the campe whereas all the chalenges were finished, and there the
Frenche kyng perceiuyng the cōmyng of the Englishe maskers, stode
still beholdyng them. Then the kyng of England put of his viser and
preased vnto the Frenche kyng: then the two kynges enbrased and amiably
together communed, after whiche communicacion either of other
by kyngly salutyng tooke leaue, and for remembraunce either to
other gaue giftes. The kyng of England gaue to the Frenche kyng
a collor of Iewels of precious stones called Balastes the Sanker
furnished with great Diamantes and Perles. The Frenche
kyng gaue to the kyng of England a Bracelet of precious stones,
riche Iewels and fayre, and so departed the sayd two noble kynges,

the sayd .xxiiii. day of Iune, whiche was sonday and Midsomerday.
               Duryng this triumph so muche people of Picardie and west Flaū
                  ders
drew to Guysnes to se ye kyng of England &amp; his honor, to whō vitailes
of the court were in plentie, the conduicte of the gate ranne wyne
alwaies, there were vacaboundes, plowmen, laborers &amp; of the bragery,
wagoners &amp; beggers that for drunkennes lay in routes and heapes, so
great resorte thether came, that bothe knightes &amp; ladies that wer come
to see the noblenes, were faine to lye in haye and strawe, &amp; helde theim
therof highly pleased. From the court of the Emperor, nor of the Lady
Margaretes court, nor of Flaūders, Brabāt nor Burgoyn came neuer
a persone to answere to the chalenge: By that it semed that there was
small loue betwene the Emperor and the Frenche kyng: Moreouer,
Mounsire Fayot capitaine of Boleyn with Mounsire Chattelon did
their deuoier to haue taken the toune of sainct Omer, of whiche doyng
was thought no goodnes to the Emperor.
               Monday the .xxv. day of Iune, the kyng of England &amp; the Quene &amp;
all the court remoued frō Guysnes to the toune of Caleys &amp; there made
the kyng his abode, where was concluded the metyng of the Emperor
with the kyng, wherfore was made newe and great prouisions.
               In the tyme of the triumph there was a mutteryng that the toune of
Caleys should be rēdred into the Frenche kinges hādes, &amp; for truth the
Frenchmen so spake &amp; sayd, wherwith many Englishmen wer greued.
               Whyle the kyng lay thus in Caleys he considered the charge of his
nobles, and thought that lesse nombre of seruauntes would now serue
them for the tyme of his abode, and so caused the Cardynal to call all ye
gentlemen before him, whiche in the kynges name gaue to theim thankes
with muche commendacions, and for eschewyng of cost, because the
kyng taried but the Emperors commyng, he licēsed them to send home
the halfe nombre of their seruauntes &amp; bad them after their long charges
to liue warely, this terme warely was amongest the moste part taken
for barely, at whiche saiyng the gentlemen sore disdained.
               Thus in Caleys rested the kyng &amp; the quene vntil the .x. day of Iuly.
Then y• kinges grace with goodly repaire rode to the toune of Grauelyng
in Flaunders there that night to rest &amp; se the Emperor, on ye kyng
were waityng the lord Cardinal, Dukes, Marquises, Erles, bishops,
Barons, knightes, and gentlemen. The noble Emperor passed the water
of Grauelyng, and at a place called Waell, there he met &amp; receiued
the kyng of England, the Emperor made suche semblant of loue to all
the court of England that he wan ye loue of Thenglishmen, &amp; so passed
the Emperor and the kyng of England to Grauelyng where the kyng
lodged the best that might be, all lordes, gentlemen, yomen &amp; all sortes
of Englishmen frō the highest to the lowest were so chered and feasted,
with so louyng maner that muche they praised Themperors court. In
Grauelyng was the Emperors Aunte Margarete, she welcomed the
kyng and other noble men of the realme.
               
                  When the Frenche kyng and his lordes had knowlege of ye metyng
of the Emperor and the kyng of Englād in the towne of Grauelynge,
they were therewith greatly greued, as by many thinges appeared, for
after the Englishmen were in Fraunce disdained, &amp; in their suites there
greatly deferred and had litle right and muche lesse fauor, so from day
to day still more and more began hartbrennyng, and in cōclusion open
warre did arise betwene the two realmes.
               Wednisday the .xi. day of Iuly, the Emperor &amp; the lady Margarete
came with the kyng of England to the toune of Caleys, the Emperor &amp;
the lady Margaret were lodged in Staple hall, and al gentlemen and
other lodged in other places right well prepared of all necessaries for
their cōmyng: &amp; for solas was builded a banquetyng house, 80. foote
round, after a goodly deuise, builded vpō Mastes of shippes in suche
maner as I thinke was neuer sene, for in it was the whole spere portrated,
whiche by reason of the great winde that blewe, could not be acheued,
thesame day at night, the kyng &amp; .xv. persones were apparelled
all in blacke Ueluet couered with cloth of gold, cut on the veluet, fastened
 wt knottes of gold, on the whiche knottes honge spangels of gold
like tuftes, and bonettes of thesame and clokes of crimosyn Satten &amp;
cloth of gold wrapped trauers, and their buskyns of thesame clothe of
gold. All these lustie maskers went to the Emperors lodgyng and wer
receiued and in the chambre of presens daūced and reuelled, the whiche
at the Emperors request, the kyng and other theimselues disuisered,
whereby the kyng was knowen: then the kyng toke his leaue and departed
for that night.
               Tewsday the .xii. day of Iulye, because the banquet house could not
be finished, the Emperor and the lady Margaret supped with the king
&amp; the quene at the Checker, where thesame night after supper reuelled
lxxxxvi. Maskers: after the reuelles was a banquet: After whiche
banquet the kyng brought the Emperor and the ladie Margaret to
the Staple, and after withdrewe him.
               This night was .viii. compaignies of maskers, and in euery compaignie
.xii. persones all in gold, siluer and veluet richely apparelled,
but because the rome was small, the shewe was the lesse.
               In these reuelles were put in maskers apparel diuers gentlemen of
the Frenche court vnwetyng to ye kyng or any other that bare rule, for
diuers yong gentlemen of the Frenche court fauored more the Frenche
partie, then the Emperors partie, through whiche meanes they saw and
muche more heard then they should haue done.
               Friday, the .xiii. day of Iuly, the Emperor did intend to haue departed
from Caleys, but the counsail was suche that he departed not that
night. The charters before tyme cōcluded, there were redde, and to the
Emperor declared all the whole articles of high peace and league tripertite,
to whiche the Frenche kyng had assented and fully contented, &amp;
for the more exemplificacion of thesame, he sent thelorde de Roche with

letters of credēce to signifie to the Emperors Maiestie that to thesame
articles he the Frenche kyng promised in the worde of a king as prince
faythfull, to obserue &amp; kepe for him and his realme &amp; subiectes. Thus
by the lorde de Roche in the Emperors presēce &amp; before the king of England
in the name of his master there shewed the Frenche kynges will
in the toune of Caleys with many high and vrgent causes concernyng
the princes, whereby the Emperor went not out of Calays that night,
by whiche abode the Emperors seruauntes were muche in doubt of the
Emperors persone.
               Saterday the .xiiii. day of Iuly, about none the Emperor toke leaue
of the quene of England his aunte and of her traine of ladies, the kyng
with all his nobles conducted the Emperor on hisway to a village towardes
Flaūders called Wael, where the Emperor enbrased the kyng,
and him betoke to almightie God, and the kyng gaue to him a courser
of Naples richely apparelled.
               The kyng toke leaue of the Duches of Sauoye great aunte to the
Emperor and of all nobles of the Emperors court, &amp; so departed, smal
tyme in Calayce the kyng made abode, but in goodly hast shipped and
with the quene and all other nobles in safetie tooke lande. And after
passed the tyme of Sommer with huntyng and other sportes honorably
and made no great iestes this yere.
               This yere the kyng kept his Christmas at his Maner of Grenewiche
with muche noblenes &amp; open court. And the .x. day of February
in his owne person Iusted to all comers, and the .xii. day his grace and
therle of Deuonshyre with .iiii. aydes answered at the Turnay all comers
whiche wer .xvi. persones, noble and riche was their apparel, but
in feates of armes the kyng excelled the rest.
               In this tyme was Edwarde Duke of Buckyngham accused to the
kyng of high treason,The duke of Buckingham accused, wherfore the kynges grace by the aduise of his
coūsail, sent &amp; directed his letters to the sayd duke, beyng at his maner
of Thornbury in the countie of Glocester, that incontinent he should
come to his presence all excuses layde aside. Also the kyng gaue commaundement
to sir Willyam Cumpton, sir Richard Weston, and sir
Willyam Kyngston knightes for the kynges body, to take with them
secret power and also seriauntes at armes, and that thei should wisely
take hede that when the duke had receiued the kynges letters, he shuld
not conuey himselfe, whiche they wisely accomplished.
               The sayd Duke vpon the sight of the kynges letters remoued, &amp; so
iornied tyll he came to Wyndsore, and there offered at S. George, and
alwayes not farre from him awaityng his demeanor, were thesame
knightes liyng. The duke lodged in Wyndsore for that night, and as
it was well proued, he meruailously feared, insomuche that he called
vnto him a seruaunt of the kynges named Thomas Ward, thesame
Thomas Ward was gentleman Herbenger for the kyng, and demaū
                  ded
of him what he made there, who answered, saiyng that ther lay his

office, there the duke perceiued that he could not escape. And so muche
was he in spirit troubled that as he was at breakefast his meat would
not doune, yet he made good countenaunce, and shortly toke his horse,
and so rode till he came to Tothill besides Westminster where he toke
his barge: before this tyme was the dukes chauncellour taken and as
a prisoner kept in the tower, whiche had confessed matter of high treason
concernyng the kynges persone.
               When the Duke was in his barge, he commaunded to lande at my
lorde Cardinals bridge, where he landed with foure or fiue of his seruauntes,
desiryng to see thesame lorde Cardinall, but to him was answered
how the same lorde was diseased, well sayd the duke yet will I
drynke of my lordes wyne or I passe, then a gentleman of my lordes
brought the Duke with muche reuerence into the Seller, where the
duke dranke.
               When he sawe and perceiued no chere to him was made, he chaunged
colour and so departed to his barge, saiyng to his seruauntes, I
meruail where my chauncellor is, that he cōmeth not to me, not knowyng
that he was in prison.
               The duke thus in his barge cōmyng towardes London, sir Henry
Marney capitaine of the Kynges Garde, on him attendyng C. yomen
of the Kynges garde in a barge on the ryuer of Thames met the same
duke, and without abode borded the dukes barge &amp; him in the Kynges
name attached. And then from him were put his seruauntes, and the
duke was brought to the Haie wharfe and there landed, the dukes seruauntes
were commaunded to go to the Maner of the Rose in sainct
Larence Pountnay, and there to abide tyll the Kynges pleasure were
further knowen.
               Sir Henry Marnay brought the duke through the Thames strete
to the Tower of London, the people muche mused what the cause
might he, and for trouth till it was knowen, among theim was muche
speakyng. There was also attached a Monke of a Charter house besides
Bristow called Henton, also Master Ihon Delaker the Dukes
Confessor, and the dukes Chauncellor before mencioned, al were in the
Tower prisoners. The .xvi. day of April was the same Duke brought
to the Tower. Alas the while that euer ambicion should be the losse of
so noble a man, and so muche in the kynges fauor, by him all lordes
and other may beware how they geue credence to false prophesies
or false hypocrites. For a Monke of the Charter house shewed
the duke that he should be kyng of England, whiche to the
kynges persone could be no higher treason. Alas that
euer he gaue credence to suche a false traitor.
            
            
               
               The .xiii. yere.
               
                  IN this tyme inquiries were made in diuers shyres of Edward
duke of Buckyngham beyng prisoner in the tower
of London, where, by the knightes and gentlemen, there
he was endited of high treason for certaine wordes spoken
by thesame duke in Blechy
                     •
                  gly to the lorde Aburgenye,
thesame Lorde was attached for consailement, and the Lorde
Mountague the kynges Cosyn and both ledde to the Tower. And sir
Edward Neuel knight, brother to the sayd lorde Aburgeney forbidden
the kynges presence.
               The Duke of Northfolke was made by the kinges letters patentes
high Steward of Englande, to accomplishe the high cause of appele
of the Piere or Pieres of the realme, and to decerne &amp; iudge the causes
of the piers. &amp;c.
               Wherfore shortly after was made in Westmynster hall a scaffolde
for the lordes and a presence for a Iudge railed and counter railed about,
and barred with degrees. The Duke of Northfolke was chiefe
Iudge, and many Pieres of the realme, as the Duke of Suffolke, the
Marques Dorcet, the Erles of Worcester, Deuonshyre, Essex, Shrewisbury,
Kent, Oxford, and Darby, the lorde of S. Ihons, lorde Delaware,
lorde Fitz Warren, lorde Wylloughby, lorde Broke, lorde
Cobham, lorde Harbert, and the lord Morley, satte as Peres &amp; iudges
vpon thesame duke of Buckyngham.
               When the lordes had taken their places, sir Thomas Louel and sir
Richard Chomley knightes, brought the duke to the barre with thaxe
of the Tower before him, who humbly bareheaded reuerēced the duke
of Northfolke, and after all the lordes and the kinges lerned counsail,
Then the Clarke of ye counsail sayd, sir Edward Duke of Buckynghā
hold vp thy hande, thou art endited of high treason, for that thou traitorously
hast conspired and ymagined as farte as in thee lay to shorten
the life of our soueraigne lorde the kyng: of this treason how wilt thou
acquite thee, the Duke answered by my Peres.
               And when thenditement was openly redde, the Duke sayd it is false
and vntrue, and conspired and forged to bryng me to my death, &amp; that
will I proue, allegyng many reasons to falsefy the inditement, and against
his reasons the kynges Atturnay alleged the examinacions, cō
                  fessions
and proues of witnesses.
               The Duke desired the witnesses to be brought furth, then was
brought before him sir Gylbert Perke priest his Chauncellor, fyrst
accusor of thesame Duke, Master Ihon Delacourt priest, the Dukes
Confessor and his owne hand writyng layde before him to the accusement
of the duke. Charles Kneuet Esquyer Cosyn to the Duke, and a
Monke, Prior of the Charterhouse besides Bathe, whiche like a false

ypocrite had enduced the Duke to the treason, and had diuers tymes
sayd to the duke that he should be kyng of England, but the duke sayd
that in himselfe he neuer consented to it. Diuers presumpcions and accusementes
wer layde to him by Charles Kneuet, whiche he would fain
haue couered. The deposicions were redde, and the deponentes were
deliuered as prisoners to the officers of the Tower.
               Then spake the Duke of Northfolke, and sayd my lorde, the kyng
our soueraigne Lorde hath commaunded, that you shall haue his
lawes ministred with fauor and right to you. Wherfore if you haue
any other thing to say for your selfe you shallbe hard. Then he was
commaunded to withdrawe him, &amp; so was led into Paradise a house so
named. The lordes went to counsail a great while and after tooke
their places. Then sayd the Duke of Northfolke to the Duke of
Suffolke, what say you of sir Edward Duke of Buckyngham touchyng
the high treasons? the Duke of Suffolke answered, he is giltie,
and so sayd the Marques and all the other Erles &amp; lordes: Thus was
this prince duke of Buckyngham founde giltie of high treason by a
Duke, a Marques, vii. Erles, and .xii. Barons.
               The Duke was brought to the barre sore chafyng and swette meruailously,
after he had made his reuerēce, he paused a while. The duke
of Northfolke as a Iudge sayd, sir Edward, you haue heard how you
be indited of high treason, you pleaded thereto not giltie, puttyng
your selfe to the Peres of the realme, the whiche haue found you giltie:
then the Duke of Northfolke wept and sayd, you shalbe l
                     •
                  dde to the
kynges prison and there layde on a Herdill and so drawen to the place
of execucion,The duke of Bu
                        •
                     kynghās iudgement. and there to be hanged, cutte doune a liue, your membres
to be cutte of and cast into the fyer, your bowels brent before you, your
head smytten of, and your body quartered and deuyded at the kynges
will, and God haue mercy on your soule. Amen.
               
               The Duke of Buckingham sayd, my lorde of Northfolke, you haue
sayd as a traytor should be sayd vnto, but I was neuer none, but my
lordes I nothyng maligne for that you haue done to me, but the eternal
God forgeue you my death and I do: I shal neuer sue to the kyng
for life, howbeit he is gracious prince, and more grace may come
from him then I desire. I desire you my lordes and all my felowes to
pray for me.
               Then was the edge of the axe turned towardes him, and so led into
a barge, sir Thomas Louell desired him to sytte on the cusshyns and
carpet ordained for him, he sayd nay, for when I went to Westminster
I was duke of Buckyngham, nowe I am but Edwarde Bowhen the
mooste caitiffe of the worlde. Thus they landed at the Temple, where
receiued him sir Nicholas Uawse &amp; sir Willyam Sandes Baronetes
and led him through the citie, who desired euer the people to pray for
him, of whom some wept and lamented, and sayd, this is thende of euil

life. God forgeue him, he was a proude prince, It is pitie that he behaued
him so against his kyng and liege lorde, whō God preserue. Thus
aboute .iiii. of the clocke he was brought as a cast man to the Tower.
               Frydaie the .xvii. day of Maie, about .xi. of the clocke. This duke we
a great power was deliuered to Ihon Kyeme and Ihon Skeuyngton
shyriffes, who led him to the skaffolde on Tower hill, where he sayd he
had offended the kynges grace through negligence and lacke of grace,
and desired al noblemen to beware by him, and al men to pray for him,
and that he trusted to dye the kynges true man. Thus mekely with an
a
                     •
                  e he toke his death, on whose soule Iesu haue mercy. Then the Augustine
friers toke the body &amp; head and buried them. Alas that euer the
grace of truth was wtdrawen frō so noble a man, that he was not to his
kyng in alegeaunce as he ought to haue been, suche is thende of ambicion,
thende of false prophesies, thende of euil life and euil counsail.
               About this tyme Fraunces the Frenche kyng made open warre against
the Emperor Charles both by lande and sea. The Prouinces of
Aragon, Castle, and all Spayne, Germany, Brabant, Flaunders &amp; the
steades mainteined the partie of the Emperor. The kynges highnes
cōsideryng ye murder &amp; effusion of Christen bloud, and the trouble that
might ensue to al the princes of Christendome, by inuasion of the great
Turke, sent the Cardinal of Yorke his Chaūcellor by name lord Thomas
Wols
                     •
                  y to his toune of Calayce to intreate an amitie and peace
betwene those two mightie princes. For this voiage great preparacion
was made, not onely for him but also for the Erle of Worcestre then
lorde Chamberlayn, the lord of sainct Iohns, the lord Ferryes, the lord
Harbert, the bishop of Duresme, the bishop of Ely, the Primate of Armicane,
sir Thomas Boleyn, sir Ihon Peche, sir Iohn Hussey, sir Richard
Wyngfelde, sir Henry Gildforde, and many other knightes, Esquiers,
gentlemen, Doctors, and learned menne. And thus honorably
accompanied he rode through London the .xxv. day of Iuly, &amp; at Thomas
Beckettes house the Maier and Aldermen toke leaue of him, praiyng
God to send him good spede, Thus passed he to Cātorbury where
tharchebishop, and the bishop of Cātorbury and other places receiued
him in pontificalibus and brought him to his lodgyng vnder Canape
to the bishoppes palayce: the .viii. day of Iulye he came to Douer: the
xx. day he and thother lordes with their retinues toke passage, &amp; ariued
at Calayce in safetie, where the lord Deputie &amp; counsail receiued them
with muche honor, and lodged the Cardinal in the Staple hall.
               Shortly after whose ariuall, came thether ye Chauncelor of Fraūce,
and the Countie de Palays with .iiii.C. horse, as ambassadors frō the
Frenche kyng. And likewise from the Emperor came great Ambassadors,
and when thei satte in counsail, the Emperors Ambassade shewed
their Commission &amp; power. And euen so did the Frenche kynges Ambassade,
whiche was more larger then the Emperors commission.
               
                  Thus when the grudges were declared on bothe sides, when the Emperors
Ambassadors cōsented to peace, the Frenche kynges would not.
And when the Frenche Ambassadors cōsented to peace, the Emperors
would not. The Cardinal then would haue knitted the Emperor, the
kyng our soueraigne lorde, the Frenche kyng, and the bishop of Rome
in a league and amitie together: the other Ambassadors had no suche
Commission, especially the bishop of Romes, wherevpon letters were
sent to Rome in all hast and the Frenchmen taried in Calayce till he returned,
&amp; beheld the toune, with whiche the counsail of Calaice wer not
contented. Herevpon the Cardinal rode to the Emperor accompanied
with his Ambassadors (and left the Frenche ambassadors in Calaice to
abide his returne) and passed by Grauelyng, Dūkirke, Newport, Owdenborow,
&amp; sundry tymes in the waie he was encoūtred and receiued
with noble men. And without Bruges he was receiued with many noble
men, and many lordes and other of the Emperors court, and a myle
without Bruges the Emperor his owne persone met him, and shewed
to him and to the other lordes &amp; gentlemen of Englād gracious countenaūce,
&amp; so accompanied y• Cardinal into the toune, where great multitude
of people beheld them, &amp; so rode to the Emperors palayce where
he lighted, and fyrst embrased the Cardinal and after all the lordes,
knightes, and gentlemen of Englande. It is to suppose the Emperor
knewe of the Commission geuen to the sayd Cardinal, whiche had the
kynges power as if his grace had been present, and also had the great
seale wt him, whiche had not been seen before, or els the Emperor would
not haue done him so high honor and reuerence.
               The Englishe lordes, knightes, esquiers, yomen of the kinges gard
&amp; other beyng to the nomber of .iiii.C.lx. horse, were well lodged euery
man after his degree, and euery lodgyng furnished with fewell, bread,
bere, wyne, Beues, Muttons, Ueles, Lambes, Uenison, and all maner
deintie viand aswell in fishe as fleshe, with no lacke of spices and bankettyng
dishes.
               The next day after the great chere made to ye lorde Cardinal &amp; to all
his lordes, knightes, gentlemen, and all other lordes and knightes of
England (in whose presence) the Cardinal made his proposicion cōcernyng
peace to be had betwene the sayd Emperor and the Frenche kyng
declaryng the calamities, misery, and wretchednes that came by warre:
and the cōmodities, benefite, and welth that came by peace, concorde &amp;
trāqulitie, whiche proposicion continued a great while: and when the
Cardinal had made an ende, the Emperor himselfe answered and sayd:
The lawe God byndeth euery man to claime and aske his right, &amp; that
thesame lawe byndeth no man to holde, kepe, and withstande another
mans right. Our cosyn of Fraunce doeth withholde our rightes &amp; patrimonies
whiche we haue princely desired, &amp; eftsones wil, and if he wil
rendre to vs our sayd rightes &amp; patrimonies, we are contented to haue
peace with him and his subiectes, if not we trust in God and our right

that the troubles by your fatherhed rehersed, shal come vpon him and
his adherentes. And for the titles of our regalitie, to putte that to the
bishop of Rome, we do consider that kyng Edwarde of Englande the
third of that name of noble memory, warred by iust title to recouer the
realme of Fraunce from Philip de Ualois, whiche title by intercession
was put to the bishop of Rome &amp; his court, to discusse &amp; expended there
by y• space of .xxiii. yeres vndetermined, notwithstāding great pursuite
&amp; labor was made to haue it ended: Suche like tyme should be to vs
tedious, wherfore we entende by the ayde of God to folowe our title.
               The Cardinal replied and declared the league that was betwene the
thre mightyest princes of the worlde, that is to say, the Emperor, the
kyng our soueraigne lorde Henry the .viii. and the Frenche kyng, and
how that to the prince that fyrst moued warre, the other two should be
enemies vnto him, and sayd, beholde the mightie power and puissaunt
realme, riches, shippes, vitailes, and ordinaūce, lordes, chiualry, horsemen,
archers and comminaltie, this is in the high and mightie kyng of
England my soueraigne lord, and he that fyrst warre beginneth, by the
sayd league my sayd soueraigne lorde to his honor may lefully spr
                     •
                  d
his baner and make warre in defence of his frende. For this and other
thynges my soueraigne lorde desires of your highnes and Maiesrie
the consent of peace.
               My lorde Cardinal sayd the Emperor, I esteme moste the honor of
my dere vncle the kyng of Englande and trust in his assuraunce, that
neither his royall person, his realme, his power, Nauye, nor ordinaūce
shalbe but to our ayde in assistyng our tried title, nor will cōsent to any
thyng in dishonoryng vs or our Empire: God defende but we should
humble our selfe to his request, our high honor reserued. Lorde God
who may esteme more higher iniuries and wronges then we in our person,
our predecessours, and our louyng subiectes haue endured by the
house of Fraunce. My lorde Cardinall sayd the Emperor, their pride
with our honor we may &amp; must apprehende and ouerthrow by the help
of God: With these wordes the counsail brake vp.
               All the lordes and menne of honor of England that day dyned in the
Emperors court.
               When they were set and serued, it came so to passe that an honorable
man of the Emperors as he sat at dyner sayd thus. It is thought that
the kynges Maiestie of Englande entendeth to make a peace. Alas
that euer he should ymagyn a thyng so muche to the dishonor of the
Emperor. The kyng is his vncle, is it not come to his hearyng that
all the worlde heareth? It was so that by assent of the bishoppe of
Rome and other princes to make peace with vs, the Frenche partie
after the battail of Gyngate obtained by Maximilian then archeduke
of Osteriche, where euerye noble manne of vs fought with
the Frenchmen quarter naked, and slewe of theim a meruailous nomber.
They desired the doughter of Maximilian named Margarete

to wife, whiche lady is Duches of Sauoy and yet liuyng, &amp; she beyng
like an Emperors childe was deliuered into their handes as quene of
the realme, with diuers tounes in Picardie rēdred with her and partie
of high Burgonie, and treasure meruailous. Now
                     •
                   sithen thesame
Maximilian had spoused Iane doughter and heire of Fraunces duke
of Britaigne, whiche lande the Frenchemen ouer rāne and spoiled, and
she constrained to sue vnto Charles kyng of Fraunce for a safe conduict
to passe through his realme to Maximilian her spouse, and vpon
the same safe conduict graunted, the sayd ladie Iane passyng through
Fraunce with a small company, was by y• same Charles taken at Ambois
&amp; there maried her against her will, whervpon he forsoke the lady
Margarete and sent her againe to her father themperor without redyliuer
or rendryng againe the tounes that were deliuered with her. And
where as the duke of Geldre is subiect to the Emperor, is he not yet at
this day by the procurement of the Frenche kyng, rebell? And where
also by iust title the realme of Naples ought to be vnited to the croune
of Castle, did not the Frenche kyng faine a iorney into the holy lande
pretendyng title by Ieniamy brother to the great Turke beyng then
captiue in Rome, and by a craftie treatie obtained the sayd Ieniamy, &amp;
so passed into Naples without perill, and seazed all the lande into his
handes, &amp; then prisoned he thesame Ieniamy? Thus to the great dammage
of Castle, he made claime to Naples by Margaret quene of England
late wife to Henry the vi.
               The kyng of Nauerne is euermore vassal to the house of Aragon &amp;
Castell, yet the Frenche kyng caused him to rebell, hopyng thereby to
subdue the sayd countreys.
               Of late daies the Frenche kyng by false treason caused sir Robert
de la Marche to submitte himselfe to the Emperors Maiestie, who receiued
him vpō his othe &amp; fidelitie, pardonyng all offences past. Is not
this false traitor returned, and is of the Frenche partie? How may that
court, that counsail, that kyng, that realme that consenteth to treason &amp;
periury by maintenaunce of traitors be called honorable? Hath not the
Frenche kyng sworne, and is bounden neuer to retaine the Switchers
in wages to make warre against the Emperor? &amp; yet doth at this day,
And albeit that his Maiestie speaketh not of these thinges, yet he well
considereth them. I trust verely sayd this noble man that God sayeth,
v
                        ••
                     e Burgoigne, euery man that heard this rehersall, knewe that it was
true, howbeit he was not answered, but some Englishe knightes sayd,
sir you haue sayd well, and as God will all must be. Thus was this
narracion ended.
               In this season the Emperor gatte the toune of Mewzon: Also of the
Emperors partie a great army arriued in the Duchy of Mylan &amp; also
the Emperors power besieged the noble citie of Messiers, but the capitaine
called Franciscus was suspected of treason, for he remoued with

the hoste from the seage without knowlege of the Emperor.
               The Emperor made a seage volant aboute the citie of Turnay, for
the reskue wherof and also of Messiers the French kyng made a great
army and him selfe in person.
               Duryng this seage the Frenchemen toke a Spaniardes ship laden
with Englishemens goodes at Margate within the kinges streames,
not without great slaughter on both parties, yet the Frenchemen were
C.lx. men, and of Spaniardes and Englishemen only .xxv.
               The kyng of Denmarke Cristianus came to se themperor his brother
in law beyng a stately prince, yet meanes was made that the lorde
Cardinal and he spake together without great signe of amitie.
               The lorde Cardinal after he had soiorned in Bruges by the space of
xiii. daies &amp; concluded diuers matters with the Emperor &amp; accomplished
his cōmission: he tooke leaue of his Maiestie, and likewise did all
the noblemen of England, &amp; after cōuenient iornies ariued with al his
company at Calyce, where thembassadors of Fraunce taried him, &amp; immediatly
after his ariuyng he treated wt thē of peace, yet not so ernestly
as he did before &amp; that perceiued well the sayd Ambassadors &amp; wrote
therof to the Frēche kyng, yet the welth &amp; prosperitie of both ye realmes
and their subiectes were highly reasoned betwene the Cardinal and the
sayd Ambassadours, especially for fishyng, wherevpon was concluded
that the subiectes of both the princes might freely fishe on the sea, and
repaire to any porte of thone or thother prince without robbyng, spoylyng,
or takyng vnto the second day of February next.
               The Frenche kyng with a mightie army &amp; himself in person repaired
to the coūtrey of Cambray, mindyng to passe the streites, but they wer
wtstanded by the Emperors power, yet he cōtinued there frō October
vnto Nouembre wtout any thing doyng, to the great displeasure of the
French kyng. The duke Daleson hearyng that, made preparacions wt
the Almaynes to passe the marrys by the point Dassans &amp; there the Almaynes
had made bridges of Pypes and vessels, and brought thither
their great ordinaunce. The Emperor beyng in the toune of Ualēcian
and therof aduertised, caused stronge watche to be made, and as they
would haue passed, the bastarde Emery, &amp; the capitaine of Gaunt with
xii.C. men mette with them, where was a great conflicte and many men
slaine, and at the last the Almaines wer put to flight and their bridges
and other prouisions broken: Of the Frenche partie wer slaine in this
conflicte .xiiii.C. men, and of the Burgonians were slaine the bastarde
Emery, the capitaine of Gaunte and iiii.C. men.
               The lord Cardinal after he had long treated with the Ambassadors
of Fraunce and could not bryng theim to no conformitie of peace, he
sent to the Emperor the lord of sainct Ihons and sir Thomas Boleyn
knight to aduertise his Maiestie therof.
               
                  Likewise the sayd lorde Cardinal sent to the Frenche kyng the Erle
of Worcester and the bishop of Ely to exhorte his grace to peace, he
hard theim, but he gaue theim but fewe woordes to answere, and after
they had been .xix. or .xx. daies in his hoost, they tooke leaue and returned
to Calyce.
               Duryng the continuaunce of the Cardinall in Calayce all writtes
and patentes wer there by him sealed and no shyriffes chosen for lacke
of his presence.
               The kyng of Hungary sent an Ambassador to the kynges highnes
for ayde against the Turke, whom the Cardinall honorably entertayned
duryng his abode in Calayce. His commyng was for ayde as men
sayd against the Frenche kyng.
               The lorde Cardinal after the returne of the Englishe Ambassadors
from the Emperour and from the Frenche kyng, tooke shippyng and
landed at the porte of Douer, the .xxvii. day of Nouember, and there
toke his iorney to Blechyngly, where the kinges grace welcomed him,
geuyng him also thankes for his great paines and trauail.
               This tyme the Frenche kyng layde seage to the toune and Castle
of Hedyng, the Burgonions perceiuyng they were not furnished for
the defence thereof, forsoke the sayd toune and castle and fledde into
Flaunders to no litle reioysyng of the sayd Frenchemen.
               The Admyrall of Fraunce named Mounsire Bonyfet with a puissaunt
armye made signe as though he would passe into Nauerne,
howbeit sodainly he reculed with his hoost and beseaged the toune
of Fontraby in Biskay, and brake the fyrst, second, and third walle
therof with his ordinaunce meruailously: And after gaue a freshe
assault to the same. The Spaniardes (notwithstandyng that the
ordinaunce was caryed into Nauerne for defence thereof) defended
theimselfes manfully and slewe of the Frenchemen .vi. hundreth and
moo, and of the Spaniardes .lx. slaine. Then the capitaine of Fontraby
made serche what vitailes was in the toune, and founde that
there was but for two meles, he called the inhabitauntes and menne
of warre together declaryng their great necessitie, and sayd the battery
of the walles discorages vs not, but the great necessitie of victalles,
wherfore we must do like the Wolfe that runneth from the
wood for hunger to his death, and consideryng the great scarcitie
of vitailes in Byskay, by meanes whereof we cannot be vitailed
we must nedes rendre the toune. Neuerthelesse they kept the toune
seuen daies after that they had neither bread, fleshe fruite nor oyles
in the same, but onely herbes and water, yet at last herbes fail
                     •
                  d
also, by meanes wherof they rendred the toune by composicion, and
or the Frenchemen entered, they deliuered the Englishemen all their
goodes out of the toune.
               
                  The Frenche kyng liyng enbattailed in the countrey of Cambray
sodainly brake his campe, not muche to his honor. Great warres was
this tyme in Italye, in so muche that the Emperours hoost wanne the
citie and countrey of Mylan to the high displeasure of the Frenche
kyng, for he lost there many of his nobles and other capitaines &amp; men
of warre.
               Thus the Frenche kyng returned into his countrey without reskuyng
the citie of Turnay, neuerthelesse he sent them a letter whiche was
taken by the people of the Countye of Nasson, the tenour whereof
foloweth.
               
                  Trustie and welbeloued we grete you well, lettyng you to we
                        •
                     e that
dayly before vs appeareth your true faythfull seruices, by that you
abode within our citie of Turnay with great ieopardie, to the muche
honor of vs and our realme, and to your praise and manly fame for euer,
and vs to be your good lorde for the deme
                        •
                     ites of your so high
seruices. And where as we entended the relief and reskue of you and
oure sayd subiectes and citie of Turnay, we consideryng the weale of
our persone and realme, haue remoued vs from that purpose. Wherefore
we may no more say vnto you but God and Mounsire sainct Denys
be your succours.
               
               When the Countie of Nasson knewe that no reskew should come,
he then sent for more people and ordinaunce and planted siege on all
parties of the citie. Then the capitaine of the Castell and Prouost of
the citie after thei knewe of the Frenche kynges retreite, and after long
consultacion amongest them had, rendred the Citie and Castle by appointment,
that is to say, that the Burgeises should haue .xv. daies to
depart with bagge and baggage, leuyng behynd them all the ordinaū
                  ces
aswel of the Castle as of the Citie. Thus was the Castle and Citie
of Turnay rendred into the Emperors handes the last day of Nouember,
the yere of our lorde God M.D.xxi.
               This yere many goodly and gorgious Mōmeries were made in the
court to the great reioysing of the Quene and ladies and other nobles
beyng there.
               The last day of December the Cardinal accompaignied the Emperors
Ambassadours to the court where they were honorably receiued
and highly feasted duryng their abode there, and many sumptuous
and gorgious disguisynges, enterludes and bankettes made in the
same season.
               
                  Pope Leo dyed and Adryan chosen.
                  This yere was a great pestilence and death in London &amp; other places
of the realme, and many noble capitaines died, as the lorde Broke,
sir Weston Browne, sir Ihon Heron, sir Edward, sir Ihon Peche and
muche other people.
                  The bishop of London Doctor Fitz Iames likewise deceased this
yere, and Doctor Tunstall was preferred to thesame benefice.
                  
                     The lorde Thomas Hawarde erle of Surrey, came out of Ireland
to the court the .xxv. day of Ianuary, when he had been there the space
of .xx. monethes in great trauail &amp; pain, and often tymes sore troubled
by the wylde Irishe, howbeit by his noblenes and manhod he brought
the lordes of Ireland to the kynges due obeysaunce, and had of them
many victories to his perpetual laude and praise.
                  The Frenchemen this tyme spoiled &amp; shamefully robbed the kynges
subiectes on euery coast of the sea, so that wheresoeuer the kyng roade
his poore subiectes came with lamentacions and cryes shewyng his
grace of the crueltie of the Frenchemen &amp; of their inhumaine dealyng
with them, but euer the Frenche Ambassadours promised restitucion
of euery thyng but none was restored.
                  In this moneth of Ianuary, the kyng commaunded all his shippes
of warre to be made in a readynes, whiche was done with all diligēce.
                  About this tyme the duke of Albany arriued in Scotland, notwithstandyng
that the Frenche kyng sware vnto the Cardinall that he
should neuer come into Scotlande without the kyng our souereigne
lordes consent, but for all that he had cōmission frō the Frenche kyng
although the Frenche kyng wrote to y• kyng that he was entred Scotlande
without his assent.
                  The second day of February, the kyng beyng at Grenewiche, came
thether the Cardinal with a Legacion from Leo bishop of Rome, and
also his ambassadour, on whō waited many a nobleman, the kyng met
them at his chamber doore welcōmyng them as though they had both
come from Rome. Then sayd the Cardinal, high and victorious kyng
it hath pleased our lorde God to indue your grace with a great multitude
of manifolde graces as a kyng electe in fauor of the high heauen,
and so appeareth presently by your noble persone, so formed &amp; figured
in shape and stature with force and pulchritude, whiche signifieth the
present pleasure of our lorde God wrought in your noble grace. And
further he praised his wisedome, prudence, and learnyng, with many
other goodly wordes in the praise of his most noble grace. And finally
the Cardinal declared how the sayd bishop of Rome had sent his highnes
an Acte in Bull vnder leade, declaryng therein his grace to be the
defendor of the Christian fayth,Defender of the fayth. and his successors for euermore.
                  And when his grace had receiued the sayd Bull and caused it to be
redde &amp; published, he went to his chapell to heare Masse accompanied
with many nobles of his realme and also with Ambassadors of sundry
princes, the Cardinall beyng reuested to syng Masse, the Erle of Essex
brought the Bason with water, the duke of Suffolke gaue thassay, the
duke of Northfolke helde the towell, and so proceded to Masse. And
that done gaue vnto all them that heard the Masse cleane remission &amp;
blessed the kyng and the Quene and all the people: then was the Bull
eftsones declared, and trumpettes blew, the shalmes and saggebuttes
plaied in honor of the kynges newe style. Thus his highnes went to

dinuer. In the middes whereof, the kyng of Heraldes and his compaignie
began the larges, criyng. Henricus dei graria rex. Anglie, &amp; Francie,

habundance of vitaill and wyne, to all maner of people.
                  The .x. daie of February, the Lorde Hoote chief Baron of the kynges
Eschequer gaue ouer his office, and for hym was admitted by the Cardinall,
master Ihon Fitz Iames, a right honorable man &amp; well learned.
                  In this tyme was muche busines betwene themperor &amp; the Frenche
kyng, wherefore the kyng sent to the sea sixe good shippes, well manned
and vitailed for the warre: the Admirall was called Christopher Coo
                        •
                     a
man expert on the sea, for saffegarde of the Merchauntes, and other the
kynges subiectes, that were greuously spoyled and robbed on the sea, by
Frenchemen, Scottes and other rouers.
                  This tyme the .viii. daie of February, the lorde Dacres Wardein of
the Marches of Scotlande, entered into Scotlande with .v.C. men, by
the Kynges commaundement, and there Proclamed that the Scottes
should come into the kynges peace, by the first daie of Marche folowyng,
or els to stande at their perilles, the Duke of Albany beeyng then
within fiue miles, with a mightie power of Scottes.
                  The .xi. daie of February, sir George Neuell lorde a Burgayny, beeyng

of Edwarde late Duke of Buckyngham to bee true, and after the open
confession thereof, led again to the Tower.
                  The lorde Montacute the kynges cosyn, was about this tyme recō
                     ciled
to his graces fauor, whiche had been prisoner in the Tower, with
sir Edward Neuell knight, this sir Edward Neuell was forbidden the
kynges presence, for bearyng fauor to the Duke of Buckyngham.
                  This yere the second of Marche▪ certain noble men of the Empire arriued
in Englande to passe into Spain, who were honorably receiued,
and in honor of them greate Iustes and triumphes wer made, and that
finished and doen, thei toke their leaue and departed on their iorney.
                  Also this tyme commission was geuen throughout the realme, for generall
musters to bee had, to knowe what power might bee made within
thesame, &amp; also men sworne of what substaunce and landes thei wer of,
And the Cardinall aduertised of thesame: not without grudgyng of the
people, &amp; marueilyng why thei should be sworne for their awne goodes.
                  The citee of London was this moneth aduertised of the commyng of
the Emperor, wherefore was made greate preparacion: and the citezens
sent the kynges grace one hundred tall men well harnissed, to furnishe
his nauie, appoynted to kepe the narowe seas.
                  The Frenche kyng certified the kynges highnes, by his letters dated
in Marche, how the Graunde capitain of Fraunce, the Countie de Palais,
Monsire de Lescue▪ and other noble men of Fraunce, had won the
toune of Milain, whiche was not true, for within fiue or sixe daies after,

it was euidently knowen that the Frenchemen were beaten backe,
and had wonne nothyng, to their greate shame and reproche.
                  Moreouer thesame season the Frenche kyng wrote his lettters to the
Seignory and commonaltie of Gean, to sende hym three Carectes, and
sixe Galeis furnished for the warres, vnto his porte of Breste, to maintein
his warres against the foresaied Emperor, who made hym by their
letters suche a reasonable excuse, that he was contented to spare theim
for that tyme.
                  The kynges highnes kept this yere his Easter at his manour of Richemont,
and caused his amner to make enquire, eight miles rounde about
thesaid manour, what poore people was in euery parishe. And for
the eschuyng of murther, that moste commonly fortuned euery goodfridaie,
by reason of the great resort of poore people, his grace caused them

                  Aboute this tyme a rouer or theif of Scotlande, called Duncan Camell,
was after long fight taken on the sea, by a Squier of Cornewall
called master Ihon Arondell, and presented to the kynges highnes, who
committed hym to the Tower of London, where he remaigned prisoner
a long season after.
                  In the moneth of Marche, as you haue hard before, came certain noble
men from the Emperor to the kyng, whiche the more to solace theim
enterprised a Iustes, he hymself was chief on the one side, his courser
was barded in clothe of siluer, of Denmarke embrodered with .L.L.L.

rolles of golde with blacke letters, in whiche was written, mon nauera,
put together it is, ell mon ceur a nauera, she hath vvounded my harte, and
thesame suite was his base.

                  Then folowed Anthony Kyngston, and Anthony Kneuet, their apparell

and then was there a costly banket, and when all was doen, the straungiers
tooke their leaue of the kyng and the Cardinall, and so departed
into Flaunders, geuyng to the kyng muche commendacion.
                  The kyng like a prince whiche forseeth all thynges, sawe what warre
was likely to ensue, caused the erle of Surtey his high Admirall, to put
in readines his nauie, bothe for the conduictyng of the Emperoure into
Englande, and also for the defence of his subiectes, whiche were daily
robbed and spoyled on the sea, whiche lorde Admiral toke suche diligēce
with the helpe of sir Willyam Fitz Willyam his Uice Admirall, that al
the shippes by the beginnyng of Aprill, were rigged and trimmed, and
in especial the Henry grace of due, the kynges greate ship, was brought
out of the riuer of Thamis into the Dounes, redy to saile whether God
and the kyng would.

Iustices, and all the gentlemen, Bailiffes and other, resortyng thether,
toke suche an infeccion, whether it wer of the sauor of the prisoners, or of
the filthe of the house, that many gentlemen, as sir Ihon Cut, sir Giles
Alyngton knightes, and many other honest yomen thereof died, and all
moste all whiche were there present, wer sore sicke and narrowly escaped
with their liues. And this yere also died Sir Edwarde Pownynges,
knight of the Gartier, sir Ihon Pechy, and sir Edwarde Belknap, valiaunt
capitaines, whiche wer suspected to be poysoned, at a banket made
at Arde, when the twoo kynges met last.
                  This yere also, was not without Pestilence nor Derthe of Corne, for

in other places, for .xxvi.s.viii.d. And in thesame yere in Decēber, died
Leo bishop of Rome, for whom was chosen, one Adriā borne at Utrike
the Emperors schoole master. And in thesame moneth Gawan Doglas
bisshop of Dunkell in Scotlande, fled out of Scotlande into England
because the Duke of Albany was arriued into Scotlande, and had taken
vpon hym to be gouernor of the kyng and the realme to whom the
kyng assigned an honest pencion to liue on. But when the king was aduertised,
that the Duke of Albany was arriued into Scotland, and had
taken the rule of the young kyng, his realme, and he muche doubted the
sequele of the matter, consideryng the Duke to be heire apparant to the
Croune of Scotlande: wherefore he sent Clarēseaux kyng of Armes into
Scotlande, and with commaundement, that he should declare to the
Duke of Albany, that his pleasure was, that he should depart ye realme
of Scotlande for twoo causes, the one, because it was promised by the
Frenche kyng, at the laste metyng, that he should not come into Scotlande,
the second was, that the kyng of England was vncle to the kyng
of Scottes, and by the very bonde of nature, ought to defende his nephew.
Wherefore his nephew beyng young, and in the custodie of hym,

to whom, if the should dye, the realme of Scotlande should discende, he
doubted lest he might be brought out of the waie, as other dukes of Albany
before had serued the heires of Scotlande: and if he would not auoyde
Scotlande, then Clarenseaux was commaunded to defie hym,
whiche accordyngly did defie hym, at holy Rode house in Edenbrough,
to whom he answered, that niether ye Frēche kyng, nor the kyng of Englande,
should let him to come into his naturall countrey, by their agrement:
also as touchyng the young kyng, he saied, that he loued hym as
his souereigne lorde, and hym would kepe and protest, against al other.
                  When Clarenseaux had reported his answere to the kyng, then he
knewe well that all this was the Frenche kynges dooyng wherefore he
prouided in all thynges accordyngly. The erle of Anguishe of Scotlande
that had maried lady Margaret, the kyng our souereigne lordes
sister, late wife vnto kyng Iames of Scotlande, that was slain at Floddon
felde, was by the Duke of Albany, sent by a coloured Ambassade
into Fraunce, where shortely after his arriuyng, he was by the Frenche
kyng committed to prison, and his brother likewise, whiche escaped after
as you shall heare.
                  Also the .vi. daie of Marche, the Frenche kyng commaunded all Englishemēnes
goodes beyng in Burdeaux to be attached and put vnder
a reste: and likewise deteined the kynges tribute, whiche he should haue
out of Fraunce, and also the French quenes dowry, and when the kyng
sent to hym for it, he euer gaue faire wordes, and made delaies, but none
was paied, and euer the Ambassador promised faire.

kyng, and the kyng of Englande liyng still an entreator betwene them,
the Englishemen were robbed on bothe sides, and when their wines wer
laden at Burdeaux, and ready to depart, it was attached, and the Merchauntes
put in prison: the poore fishermen on the coast of Englande,
sometyme met with the Frenchemen and them spoyled, but to no recompence
of that thei had taken. The Merchauntes of Englande, that had
factors at Burdeau

                  , complained to the kyng of Englande, and shewed
hym how the Frenche kyng, contrary to his league and his safeconduit

their factors and frendes, and can haue no remedy. Likewise complayned
all the Merchauntes, how their shippes were restrained, in euery

porte of Fraunce, and their goodes rifeled, and could haue no redresse,
The kyng and his counsaill, were sory to here the cōplaintes of the merchauntes,
and so concluded to sende for the Frenche Ambassadours, to
whom the Cardinall saied: sir how is this chaunce happened? you haue
promised euer in the name of the kyng your Master, that all leagues,
promises, and couenauntes should be kept, &amp; that ful restitucion should
bee made of euery hurte and dammage▪ and that ferme peace and amitie

sworne to kepe? Is this the woorde of a kyng? Is this the strength of a
prince, to breake his safconduite? And where you aduised our merchantes

them, and kept bothe them and their goods, is this iustice? is this
restitucion? And all this was your procurement, and now see what is
come of your promise, surely this maie not bee suffered, and beside this
the kyng is enformed, that the kyng your Master hath spoken by hym,
foule and opprobrious wordes yea, in the hearyng of the Englishemen
whiche were sore greued to heare suche wordes, and were not able to be
reuenged.
               The Ambassadour of Fraunce saied, that it was not so as it was reported:
well saied the Cardinall, if you note the counsaill of Englande
so light as to tel fables you be misauised, but I praie you how often times
hath the kyng written to your Master, for restitucion of suche robertes
as hath been dooen, and yet can haue no redresse? Wherefore he

that surely the matters whiche wer alleged against his Master the

for a fruthe▪ daily in the Courte of Fraunce, were complaintes made against
the Englishemen, for greate robberies dooen by theim, aswell on
land as sea, affirmyng it to be doen in the Emperors querell▪ and yet the

countrey to speake with them priuely, and the Ambassador was cōmaū
                  ded
to kepe his house in silence, and not to come in presence, till he was
sent for, whiche ordre sore abashed the Frenche hostages, and thambassador,
but there was no remedy, and commaundement was geuen to the
Maior of London, to attache all the Frenchmen body and goodes, and
them to kepe in prison, till he hard farther of the kynges pleasure: then
were all the Frenchemen in London and aboute, arrested and broughte
to prison, so that al the prisons in and aboute London, wer full of them,
some of them escaped by speakyng Dutche, and saied thei wer Flemynges
borne, whiche was not tried.
               The kyng for safegard of his Merchaūtes, sent .xxviii. goodly shippes
to the sea, well manned and trimmed for the warres, and seuen other
shippes he sent toward Scotlande, whiche entered the Frithe▪ and proferred
to enter into the Scottishe shippes that laie in the hauen▪ but the
Scottes ran their shippes on land, and the Englishemen folowed with
boates and landed, and set the shippes on

                  e kepte the narrowe seas, for then was neither peace betwene Englande
and Fraunce, nor open warre▪ as you you haue hard.
               The kyng had perfect knowlege, that Charles the Emperour would
be at the kinges toune of Calice the .xxiii. daie of Maie, to passe thorow
Englande into Spain, wherefore the kyng sent the Marques Dor
                     •
                  et,
accompaignied with diuerse knightes and gentlemen, to receiue hym at
Calice, whiche in all hast sped hym thether. Likewise the Cardinal toke
his iorney toward Douer the .xx. daie of Maie, and rode through London,
accompaignied with twoo Erles .xxxvi. Knightes, and a hundred
Gentlemen, eight Bishoppes, tenne Abbottes, thirtie Chapelleines, all
in veluet and Sattin, and yomen seuen .C, and so by iorneiyng he came
to Douer the .xxvi. daie beyng Monday. In the meane season tidynges
were brought to the kyng, that the Frenche kyng had sent a great army
toward Calice, and the men of warre laie at Abuile, Munstrell, Bullein
and aboute▪ nere the Englishe pale. Wherefore the kyng like a Prince
that forsawe all, and entendyng not to be disceiued, wrote to his nobles,
and citees, and tounes, to prepare certain menne of warre in a readines,
whiche was shortly dooen, and so thei were sent to the nauie, so tha
                     •
                   thei
might shortely bee at Calice if nede required.
               On Sundaie the .xxv. daie of Maie, the lorde Marques Dorset, the
bishop of Chichester, and the lorde de Lawarr, with other noble men, at
the water of Grauelyng, receiued the Emperor in the name of the kyng
of England, and so the Emperor embraced theim, and he hauyng in his
compaignie many noble men, came toward Calice, where at the Turnepike
in the lordeship of Marke, he was receiued of sir Edwarde Guylford
Marshall of Calice, with fiftie menne of armes richely beleen, and
also a hundred archers on horsebacke, then in passyng forward towarde
Calice, the ordinaunce shotte terribly, and into Calice he was receiued

with procession, and then by the lorde Barne deputie there, and the coū
                  saill
of the toune: then was he receiued by the Maior and Aldermen of
the toune, and then of the Maior and merchauntes of the Staple, and
so conueighed to the Checker, and there lodged.
               On the Mondaie, he and al the nobles of Spain, Flaunders, &amp; Germany,
toke ship at Calice and landed at Douer, at foure of the Clocke
at after noone, and with hym the duke Daluoy, the Prince of Orenge,

                  aw, the Countie Uascord, the lorde Ogmond, and the
Marques of Brandebrough, all in one ship bote. The Cardinall receiued
hym on the Sandes, accompaignied with three hundred Lordes,
Knightes, and Gentlemen of Englande: themperor embrased the Cardinall,
and toke hym by the arme, and so passed forward and toke horses
and rode together to Douer Castle, where thei wer lodged. Thenglishe

                  igently lodged the Emperours train, euery man accordyng
of his degree. The kyng of Englande was come to Cantorbury,
the .xxvii. daie of Maie, and receiued by the Archbishopp: and hearyng

                  nes the Emperour and he met, and there taried the Assension daie,
and on Fridaie, the kyng brought the Emperoure aborde on his newe
ship, called the Henry grace a dieu, a shippe of .xv.C. and rowed aboute
to all his greate shippes, whiche then laie in Douer rode, the Emperor
and his lordes, muche praised the makyng of the shippes, and especially
the artilerie, thei saied, thei neuer sawe shippes so armed.
               Thesame daie at after none, the two noble princes marched forward
to Cantorbury, wher the Maior and Aldermen receiued them, without
the toune, with a solempne oracion, to whom the Emperors Secretary
answered ornatly. Then the Princes with their sweardes borne naked
before theim, and the Emperour on the right hande, entered the citee of
Cantorbury, and so with procession were brought to Christes Churche,
where the Archebishop and twelue prelates mitered, receiued them vnder
a Canapy, and so thei offered to the Sacrament, and the Emperor
was brought to the Bishoppes palace, where he laie for that night, and
the kyng lodged at sainct Augustines. The morowe after, these princes
remoued to Sityngbor

                  e, and the next daie to Rochester, where the Bis

                  op
receiued them with the whole Couent, and on Mondaie thei came
to Grauersēde by one of the Clocke, where thei tooke their Barges, and
there wer thirtie Barges appoynted, for the straūgiers, and so by .vi. of
the clocke thei landed at Grenew
                     •
                  che, thesame Mondaie the .ii. daie of
Iune, where the Emperor was of the kyng newly welcōmed, and al his
nobilitie, and at the halle doore the Quene and the Princes, and all the
Ladies receiued and welcomed hym: and he asked the Quene blessyng,
(for that is the fashion of Spain, betwene the Aunte and Nephewe) the
Emperor had great ioye to se the Quene his Aunte, and in especiall his
young cosyn germain the Lady Mary. The Emperour was lodged in

the kynges lodgyng, whiche was so richely hanged, that the Spanyardes
wōdered at it, and specially at the riche cloth of estate: nothyng lacked
that might begotten, to chere the Emperor and his Lordes, and all
that came in his compaignie, were highly feasted.
               The Wednesdaie, the more to doo the Emperor pleasure, was prepared
a Iustes royall: on the one parte was the kyng, the Erle of Deuonshire
and .x. more compaignions, al mounted on horsebacke, their apparell
and bardes, were of riche Clothe of golde, embroudered with siluer
letters, very riche, with greate plumes on their heddes. This compaignie
tooke the felde, and rode aboute the tilte: then entered the Duke of
Suffolk, and the Marques Dorset, and .x. with them barded, and their
apparel was russet veluet, embroudered with sundery knottes, and culpyns
of golde. The Emperor and the Quene, with all the nobles stode
in the galery, to beholde the doyng. The kyng ran at the duke of Suffolk
.viii. courses, and at euery course brake his spere. Then euery man
ran his courses, and then doen, all ranne together volant, as fast as thei
could discharge, and when the speres appoynted were broken, then thei
disarmed and went to supper. After supper, the Emperor behelde the ladies
daunces, and sodainly came to the chamber, sixe noble mē, appareled
in Crimosin veluet and clothe of golde, and a mantell of taffeta, rolled
about their bodies, and hooddes and bonettes of clothe of golde, on
their heddes, and veluet buskyns on their legges: these Maskers entred
and daunced a greate while with the ladies, and sodainly entered sixe other
Maskers with drumslades, appareled in long gounes, and hoddes
of clothe of gold, of whiche nomber was the kyng, the duke of Suffolk
the prince of Orenge, the Countie of Nassow, the Coūtie of Naueray, &amp;
Monsire Egremond. Whē these maskers wer entred, the other auoyded
and then thei toke ladies and daunsed, so that the straūgers much praised
them, &amp; when the tyme came, euery person departed to their lodgyng.
               Thursdaie, thei that Iusted the other daie, appoynted theimselfes to
Tornay, &amp; as the kyng was armyng him, there came to him one George
Luffkin and shewed hym, that there was one come frō his Ambassador
in Fraunce, the kyng called for the messenger, and deliuered his letters,
whiche the kyng red, and saied to sir William Compton, tell the Emperor
that I haue newes, if it pleaseth hym to come hether: sir Willyam
Compton went and told this to the Emperoure, whiche without delaye
came to the kyng, whiche shewed hym the letters frō sir Thomas Cheney
his Ambassador, wherin was conteined the definitiue answer, made
aswel to sir Thomas Cheney, as to Clarenseaux kyng of armes of Englande,
by the Frenche kyng, to the kynges requestes: for you shall vnderstande,
that the kyng of Englande by his Ambassador, had often times
demaunded, bothe his tribute and his lawfull debte, and also restitucion
to bee made to his subiectes greued, and farther also the league
was broken, by makyng warre on themperor, so that now by the league
the kyng of Englande should be enemy, to hym that first brake, and did

take part with the other, yet he had so muche compassion, on shedyng of
Christen bloud, that he would not enter warre, but shewe hymself a mediator
and an entreator betwene theim. And vpō this sir Thomas Cheney
had o
                     •
                  ten moued the Frenche kyng▪ &amp; also moued hym to take peace
with the Emperor for two yeres, so that some mediacion of peace might
be 
                     •
                  ntreated, in the meane season: to all this the Frenche kyng answered,
we haue well considered your Masters desire, to the whiche we nothyng
agree, nor hold vs content with his request. Sir said thambassador, the
kyng my Master shalbe aduertised of your answere by me, wherefore I
beseche your grace of safeconduite, to returne into Englande: then saied
the kyng, there is an officer of armes comehether out of Englande, lette
hym come and he shalbe hard, and haue an answere, to whiche thyng sir
Thomas Chency answered not, but with reuerence departed, and so on
the .xxi. daie of Maie, thesaid officer called Clarenseaux kyng of armes,
came to the French kynges chāber at Lions, which was accompaignied
with many noble men and gentlemen, and then Clarenseux put on his
cote of armes, and desired license to speake, and libertie according to the
lawe of armes, whiche was to hym graūted: then he declared that where
the French kyng was bound by league tripertite, to kepe peace with the
Emperor, aud with the kyng of Englande, and whosoeuer firste brake,
the other twoo to bee enemies to hym, to the whiche league the Frenche
kyng was sworne, whiche league he apparauntly had broken, by makyng
warre on themperor, by sir Robert de la Marche and by hymself
in persone. Wherefore the kyng by that league must be his enemie, and
take parte against hym.
               Also he declared, the French kyng kept away the kynges rētes, &amp; debtes▪
dewe to hym. Also that he deteined the dower of the Frenche quene.
Also that contrary to his promise, he had sent the Duke of Albany into
Scot
                     •
                  and: Also that contrary to Iustice he had emprisoned Merchantes,
hauyng his safeconduite, where thei should haue gone in saftie, seyng
there was no warre proclaimed, betwene hym and the kyng his master:
all these articles with many mo, y• kyng my master is redy to proue.
Naie saied the Frenche kyng, I began not the warre, nor sent Robert de
Lamarche to make warre, but commaunded him to the contrary, and or
I made warre in proper person, his warre was open, &amp; he had our toune
of Cournay strong
                     •
                  y besieged, and as touchyng the duke of Albany, it
hath cost me .xl.M. Frankes, to kepe hym out of Scotland but I could
not let him to go into his awne coūtrey. This the Frenche kyng excused
his vntruth. Sir I am farther charged to tell you, said Clarēseaux that
the kyng my souereigne lorde, holdeth you for his mortall enemie, from
this d
                     •
                  ie furth &amp; al your adherentes: well said the French kyng, I loked
for this a gre
                     •
                  t while agone▪ for sith the Cardinal was at Bridges, I loked
for no nother, but you haue doen your message: then ye French kyng
rose and departed, and Clarēseaux was conueighed to his lodgyng, and
shortly after, sir Thomas Cheney and he, by safeconduite, departed and

came to Bullein, and there Monsire Fayett capitain there, theim bothe
staied till the Ambassador of Fraunce, whiche had lien in England, wer
clerely deliuered out of Calice. The whole circumstaunce of the demaū
                  des
and deffiaune, and the Frenche kynges answere, was conteined in
the letter, whiche was brought to the kyng, which shewed it to the Emperor
(as you haue hard) but while the kyng and the Emperor loked on
the letter, a sodein noyse rose emongest bothe their subiectes, that it was
a letter of defiance, sent to tem bothe by the Frenche kyng, whiche was
nothyng so. Thus now was the warre open of all parties, betwene Englande
and Fraunce, &amp; Spain. When the twoo princes had of this matter
commoned their fill, themperor called for a horse, and the kyng hymself
was armed, an
                     •
                   bothe the bendes that should Tornay mounted on
horsebacke, and themperor in rich apparell of tissew and richely trapped
brought the kyng into the felde, and toke vp his horse, that all men had
greate pleasure to beholde hym. The men of armes fell to Turnay, and
brake sweardes and were seuered, and after came together again, and
fought very valiauntly, and when tyme was, the Herauldes cried the
disarme, and assone as ht kyng was vnarmed the Emperor and he wēt
to supper, and after supper, the kyng brought the Emperor into the hall
where was a Cupperd of .xii. stages, all set with greate mightie plate al
of golde, at the vpper ende hong three clothes of estate, and the hall was
full of greate lightes, set on gylte braunches.
               When the twoo Prines were set, and the Quene also, then entered
in eight noble menne, in Maskers apparell with visers, their garmentes
blacke Ueluet, garded and embroudered with golde in cut woorkes
and ouer that double Lumberdy Mantelles of Sattyn, folded vp on
euery shulder, curiously embroudered, these Maskers were halfe Englishe
Lordes, and the other 
                     •
                  traungiers. Thei toke Ladies and daunsed,
and sodainly entered eight other Maskers, apparelled in riche tynsell,
matched with clothe of golde, and on that Turkey Clokes, rebanded
with Nettes of Siluer, and betwene the knittynges Flowers of
Golde, and the Mantelles were Crimosyn Sattyn, bothe the Maskers
had hoddes of Crimosyn Sattyn, these lustie Maskers entered, and
reueled lustely, and when thei had doen, then were there spices brought
and wyne, and then all persones began to drawe to reste.
               On Fridaie, the sixe daie of Iune, the Kyng and the Emperour, with
all their compaignies marched towarde London, where in the waie, a
Myle from Sainct Georges barre, was set a riche Tente of Clothe of
golde, in whiche Tente were twoo lodgynges, one for the Emperoure,
and another for the Kyng, where these twoo Princes shifted theim. And
when the Herauldes had appoynted euery manne their roume, then euery
manne set forwarde in ordre, richely apparelled in Clothe of gold,
Tissew▪ Siluer, Tynsell, and Ueluettes of all coloures. There lacked
no massye Cheynes, nor curious Collers: an Englishemanne and a
straung
                     •
                  er roade euer together, matched accordyng to their degrees,

before the Emperoure and the Kyng, were borne twoo swordes naked,
then the twoo Princes folowed in Coates of Clothe of Golde, embraudered
with Siluer, bothe of one suite: after theim folowed the Kynges
Henxinenne, in Coates of Purple Ueluet, pieled and paned with riche
Clothe of Siluer, and with theim were matched the Emperours Henxe
menne, in equall nomber, in Coates of Crimosyn Uelue, with two gardes,
the one Golde, and the other Siluer: then folowed the Capitaines
of the Gardes, then the Emperours Garde on the right hande, and the
Englishe Garde on the lefte hande, and so in this ordre they wēte forwarde,
and in the waie the Maior Ihon Milborne and his brethren,
in tine Skarlet and well horssed, met with the Emperoure and the kyng
where one sir Thomas More knight, and well learned, made to theim
an eloquent Oracion in the praise of the twoo princes, and of the peace
and loue betwene theim, and what comfort it was to their subiectes, to
se theim in suche smitie, and how that the Maior and Citezens, offered
any pleasure or leruice that in them laye, next their souereigne lorde.
               When this was dooen, thei came into Southwarke, where the Clergie
receiued theim, in Copes, with Crosses, and Sensers, and to kept the
one side of the strete, all the citee through. When thei came by the Marshalsie
and the Kynges Benche, the Emperoure desired pardon of the
kyng, for the prison
                     •
                  rs, and he at the Emperours request, pardoned agreate
nomber of theim. When thei were almoste at the Bridge foote,
there was a staie, the Kyng demaunded the cause, and it was tolde hym,
that the Herauldes had appoynted, twoo gentlemen to ride together,
one was the Ambassadour from the Marques of Mantua, to the Emperour,
and the other from the Citee of Seines, to the Emperour also,
and the Citee and the Marques were not frendes, the Emperoure incontinent
sente his Lorde Chamberlaine to theim, saiyng: that if thei
would that daie doo hym honoure, he would thanke theim, and if thei
would not ride as thei were appoynted, he praied theim to departe.
When the Lorde Chamberlaine had tolde this message, thei rode furth
and made no more curtesie.
               When thei were come to the Drawe Bridge, there were set Targettes,
of the Armes of the Emperoure and his Dominions, richely paincted,
and on the other side, stoode one greate Giaunte, representyng
Hercules, with a mightie Clubbe in his hande, and on the other syde
stoode another Giaunte, representyng Sampson, with the Iawe bone
of an Asse in his hande. These twoo Gyauntes helde a greate Table, in
the whiche was written in Golden letters, all the Emperours Stile.
From the Drawe Bridge these twoo Princes passed, to the middes of
the Bridge, where was raised a faire edisice, with Towers embattayled
and gates, all like Masonrie, of White and Blacke, like Touche
and White Merbell: aboue this buyldyng was a faire pagiaunt, in the
whiche stoode Iason all in harnes, hauyng before hym a golden Flece,
and on the one side of hym stoode a fiery Dragon, and on the other side

stode two Bulles whiche beastes cast out fyer continually, &amp; in a towe
                     •
                  
on the one syde stode a fayre mayde representyng the lady Medea whiche
was very straungely and richely apparelled, and aboue this Pagiant
were written these verses.

               When they had beholden this Pagiant they came to the Conduste at
Gracious strete where was made a Bastyle with two great gates, one
on the one side of the way and the other on the other side, and ouer these
gates and betwene these gates were made iii. great towers embattailed
and vauted with lopes Lucanes like Masonry, curiously wrought,
and in the middle tower was a clothe of estate, vnder whiche sat one representyng
the Emperor, and in the third tower represētyng the kyng.
And Charlemayne hauyng ii. swordes gaue to the Emperor the sworde
of Iustice, and to the kyng the sworde of triumphant victory, &amp; before
him sat the Pope to whom he gaue the croune of thorne &amp; thre nayles.
About this pagiant were sette all the armes of the electors of thempyre

                  This Pagiant was made by the Esterlynges.
                  From Gracious strete where the Esterlinges stode in good order, the
two princes came to Leden halle wher ouerthwart the great strete that
leadeth to Byshoppes gate was erected a goodly Pagiant wonderfull
curiously wrought, it was xxxviii. fote broade and lxxx. of length, at the
fote of the pagiant sat Ihon duke of Lancastre called Ihon of Gaunte
sonne to kyng Edward the third. This duke sat in a rote and out of the
rote sprang many braunches curiously wrought with leaues whiche by
pollicie dropped swete water, and on euery braunche satte a kyng and a
quene or some other noble parsonage descended of the sayd duke, to the
nomber of lv. images, and on the toppe stode the Emperor, the kyng of
England and the Quene, as thre in the vi. degree from the sayd Duke.
This pagiant was made at the cost of the Italyans &amp; was muche praised.
Frō thence they passed y• Conduite in Cornehill where the strete
was enclosed frō side to side with ii. gates to open &amp; shitte, and ouer the
gates wer arches with towers embattailed set with vanes and scutchions
of the armes of the Emperor &amp; the kyng, and ouer the arches were

two towers, the one full of Trompettes and the other full of Shalmes
and shagbuttes whiche played continually: Betwene these two towers
was a palice, vnder the riche clothe of estate sat kyng Arthur at a rounde

                  When this was sayd, they came tot he Stockes where was a quadrant
stage where on was an Herber full of Roses, Lyllies &amp; all other
flowers curiously wrought, and byrdes, beastes and all other thynges
of pleasure. And aboute the Herber was made the water full of Fyshe,
and about it was the Elementes, the Planettes and Starres in their
places and euery thing moued, and in a type in the toppe was made the
Trinitie with the Angels singyng, and the Trinitie blessed the kyng &amp;
the Emperor, and vnder his feete was written, behold the louer of peace
and concorde. And so they passed through the Poultry to the great Cō
                     duite
in Chepe, where was made on the right hand of the sayd Conduite
(as they passed) in maner quadrant with fower towers, a euery corner
one with goodly types, betwene euery tower was a gallery, whiche galeries
were hanged with clothes of golde and siluer within, &amp; so couered
ouer. The forefrontes of euery gallery were hanged with white &amp; grene
Sarcenet wrethed and with great knottes of golde, let doune in maner
of a valence before the gallery, and vnder the sayd galleries were Targettes
and schutchions of the Emperors and kynges armes &amp; deuises.
In the fower towers were fower fayre ladyes for the cardinall vertues
so richely besene that it was great pleasure to behold, euery vertue hauyng
a signe and token of her propertie. In the galleries sat children
mixed with men and women singyng and plaiyng on instrumētes melodiously,
of the whiche sort one child sayd these verses folowyng.

where the Emperor was lodged in great royaltie: All his nobles were
lodged in his newe palace of Brydewell, out of the whiche was made a
Gallery to the Emperors lodgyng, whiche gallery was very long, and
that gallery and all other galleries there wer hanged with Arras. The

against the princes of Orenge and the Marques of Brandenborow, &amp;
on the Princes syde stopped the Erle of Deuonshyre and the lorde Edmond
on the other syde, and they departed euen handes on bothe sydes
after xi. games fully played.
                  On Whitsonday the viii. day of Iune themperor and the kyng with
great honor both apparelled in cloth of siluer

whiche had his trauers &amp; cupborde, and before Masse ii. Barons
gaue him water &amp; after the Gospell ii. Erles, and at the last lauatory ii.
Dukes whiche pride the Spanyardes sore disdayned. When Masse
was done they returned to Brydewell where the Emperor was highly
feasted. Thesame sonday at after noone the two princes went by water
to Westminster and roade to the churche, and in ridyng all the sanctuary
menne cryed mercy and pardon, they were so hastye and presed
so nere that the sergeaunts at armes could scase kepe theim from
touchyng the Emperor and the kyng: The Cardinal gaue them a gentle
answere whiche contented theim for a tyme. They wer receiued with
Procession into the Abbey &amp; heard euensong &amp; beheld kyng Henry the
seuenthes chapel &amp; then went into Westminster halle, at the largenesse
wherof the Emperor muche meruailed, then they turned to Brydewell
and there supped.
                  On Mōday thei dyned in Southwarke with the duke of Suffolke
and hunted there in the Parke, and roade to the Manor of Richemond
to their lodgyng and the next day to Hampton court, where they had
great chere and from thence on thursday to Wyndsore where he hunted
Fryday and Saterday and on Sonday at night in the great halle was
a disguisyng or play, theffect of it was ye there was a proud horse which
would not be tamed nor brideled, but amitie sent prudence and pollicie
which tamed him, and force &amp; puissaunce brideled him. This horse was
ment by ye Frēche kyng, &amp; amitie by the kyng of Englād &amp; themperor, &amp;

other prisoners were their counsail &amp; power, after this play ended was
a sumptuous Maske of .xii. men and .xii. women, the men had in garmentes
of clothes of golde and siluer lose layde on crimosyn Satten,
knit with pointes of gold, bonettes, whoddes, buskyns, were al of gold,
The ladies were of thesame suite whiche was very riche to behold, and
when they had daunced, then came in a costly bāket and a voidy of spices,
and so departed to their lodgyng.
                  Monday, tewsday, and wednesday the princes and their counsail sat
moste parte in counsail, and on Corpus Christi day, they with great triumph
rode to the collage of Wyndsore where the Emperor ware his
Mantle of the Garter and satte in his owne stall, and gaue to the Herauldes
CC. crounes: that day bothe the princes receiued the Sacrament,
and after Masse bothe sware to kepe the promises &amp; league eche
to other, for the which amitie great ioy was made on both parties, &amp; after
y• Masse was ended they went to dyner, where was great feastyng.
                  On Fryday they departed out of Wyndsore, &amp; by easy iorneys came
to Wynchester the .xxii. day of Iune, &amp; in the way thether, the Emperor
hunted the Hart. Before the Emperor was come to Wynchester, therle
of Surray Admyrall of England with all y• kynges Nauy was come
to Hampton, and with him the lorde Fitz Water, the Baron Curson, sir
Gyles Capell, sir Nicholas Carew, sir Richard Wyngfeld, sir Richard
Iernyngham, Fraunces Bryan, Anthony Browne, Iohn Russell, of
whiche many were of the kynges preuy chamber: These with many mo
departed from Hampton with .xxx. shippes well manned &amp; ordinaūced
in the ende of Iune, noisyng that they should onely skoure the seas for
safegard of the Emperor and his Nauye: But they had priuy instruccions
to go to another place as you shal heare after.
                  All this while was the warre on the parties of Picardy hotte, and
the capitaine of Bullain called Fayet wrote euer mockyng letters to
the garison of Calaice, and sayd: if the garison of Calayce would issue
out, he would mete with them halfe way with iiii.M. men. Whervpon
sir Edward Guildforde Marshall of Calayce, whom the capitaine of
Bullain called the fyrebrand, because it was his badge, sette furth out
of Calayce the .xi. day of Iune with .xii.C. men, &amp; went out of Calayce
and sent a pursiuant to the capitain of Bullain certifiyng him that he
was commyng with his fyerbrand, and bad him kepe promise. This
officer declared the message to him, but he came not: Furth marched sir
Edward til he came to Marguison and taryed to see whether the capitain
of Bullayne would come or no, and when he sawe he came not, he
set fyer in the toune, and the light horsemen forrayed the beastes and
pillage, and brent villages all about, whiche was wel perceiued in the
countrey a farre of, and towarde night all the crew came home with
good pillage, &amp; on the morow sir Edwarde Gyldford deliuered a prisoner
franke and free, on condicion he should tell the capitaine of Bullain
that he had him at Marguison with his fyerbrand, whiche truely

did his message, for the whiche the capitaine brake his head: all the
castels and fortresses in the Englishe pale were well manned and vitailed
and lacked no artillerie, so that the Frenchemen could do theim
no harme.
                  When the Emperor and the kyng laye at Byshops Waltham they
ioyntly sent letters of defiaunce to the Duke of Lorraine, as alye and
confederate with the Frenche kyng. The fyrst day of Iuly the Emperors
nauy sailed before Hampton, which wer C.lxxx. goodly shippes.
When the Emperors shippes were come, he tooke leaue of the kyng
and had great gyftes geuen him and muche money lent to him, &amp; so the
vi. day of Iuly he toke his shippe, so with all his Nauy he made saile
towarde Spayne where he ariued in safetie the .x. day after.
                  The kyng about this very tyme sent to the citie of London to borow
xx.M. poūdes, whiche sore chafed the citizens, but the somme was promised,
and for the payment the Mayer sent for none but for men of substaunce.
Howbeit the craftes solde muche of their plate. This summe
was payde, and the kyng sent his letter promisyng payment of thesame
and so did the Cardinall. The poore men were content with this payment
and sayd, let the riche churles pay, for they may well. Lyke loane
was practised through al the realme, and priuy seales deliuered for the
repayment of the same.
                  This season the .xxi. day of Maye was the citie of Geane gotten by
the Emperors capitain called Octauiano de Columna, whiche had with
him .iiii.M. and, iiii.C. Spaniardes .v.M. Italyans, and .iiii.M.
Lanceknightes: &amp; in the citie was taken Porter de Nauarro the Frenche
kynges familiar capitaine and all the lordes of Geane whiche fauored
the Frenche kyng were taken prisoners or slaine, &amp; especially one Octa

                        iano
Faragoso, whiche ruled there for the Frenche kyng, was euil punished:
The spoyle of the citie that the souldiers had, was .iiii.M. dukates
beside the pillage, whiche was a great thyng.
                  Now let vs returne to the lorde Admyrall of Englande whiche departed
frō Hampton as you haue heard, and so with his Nauy sayled
and skoured the seas, and at last came on the costes of Britaigne, and
commaunded the wysest Masters and Marriners to boy the hauen of
Morles, whiche was done, an so the next night all the flete came to the
hauen of Morles in safetie &amp; moored their shippes together. Then all
men were commaunded to harnes and to auaunce their standardes, &amp;
all souldiers to geue their attendance on their capitaines, and then the
lorde Admyral appointed and caused .xiiii. pieces of ordinaunce called
Faucons to be brought to land and drawen furth with strēgth of men.
Then when all menne that should go forwarde were landed, the lorde
Amyrall with banner displayed tooke lande on the Estside of the hauen
the fyrst day of Iulye, and with him a fayre band of souldiers, as
the lorde Fitz Water, the Baron Curson, sir Richard Wyngfelde, sir
Richard Iernyngham, sir Wyllyam Barantine, sir Adrian Foskew,
sir Edwarde Donne, sir Edwarde Chamberlayne, Fraunces Bryan,

Richard Cornewall, sir Anthony poynes, sir Hēry Sherborne, and the
vice Admyrall, sir Willyam Fitzwillyam, sir Edmond Bray, sir Gyles

Anthony Kneuit, sir Ihon Tremaile, and the Master of the
kynges ordinaunce, sir Willyam Skeuyngton, and Ihon Fabian serieant
at armes, by whom this enterprise was chiefly moued as was reported,
with many other gentlemen and souldiers, to the nombre of
vii.M. The lorde Admyral and sir Richard Wyngfeld brought these
men in good order of battail, &amp; caused Christopher Morres the master
gunner to see all thinges redy prepared, &amp; then about .viii. of the clocke
the sayd fyrst day they marched towarde Morles in good ordre of battail
with banners displaied. The alarme rose in the countrey and came
to the toune of Morles wherby the gentlemen of the countrey shewed
theimselfes prickyng, but when they heard the Gunnes they fledde as
though they neuer vsed warre. They of Morles armed theimselfes &amp;
went to the walles and shut the gates and laide ordinaunce where was
moste ieopardie. The Englishemen had gone fiue long myle and were
nowe come to the subberbes of the toune: then the Englishemen archers
shot, and the Brytons them defended: then the Admyrall commaunded
the toune to be assauted, then the lord Fitz Water and the Baron Curson
quartered the toune on all sides: The Englishemen shot with long
bowes, and the Brytons with crosse bowes, whiche defended themsel

gate gaue the assaut sir Richard Wyngfelde, Nycholas Carew, Fraū
                     ces
Bryan, sir Ihon Wallop and all their bendes hauyng with them
thre pieces of ordinaune called Faucons, whiche the master Gunner
oft tymes shot, but the Britons had set the gate full of hacbushes, then
the gunner sayd, haue at the wicket, and in the smoke of the gunnes let
vs entre the gate, the gentlemen assented, then the sayd sir Christopher
Gunner strake the locke of the wicket,Mo
                           •

                        uted &amp; gotten. so that it flew open, then in the
smoke ranne to the gate the sayd Christopher and the other forenamed
gentlemen, and when Christopher came to the gate he found the wicket
open &amp; entred, and the gentlemen folowed, the Brytons defended them
selfes, but thei were put backe or slaine, then was the great gate opened
and then entered the souldiers that were on the other side of the toune.
When the Brytons on the walles sawe the towne gotten, some fled at
the posterne and some by another way, the best way that they could.
                  Therle of Surray with bāner displayed toke the market place. Then
the souldiers fell to pillage and rifled the chestes and ware houses of
marchauntes, for the toune of Morles was very riche, and specially of
lynnen clothe, the gentlemen suffered the souldiers to do what they
would. When the souldiers had taken their pleasure of the toune as
muche for a trueth or more then they could beare away.
                  
                     
The lorde Admiral cōmaunded the trumpettes to blow, &amp; cōmaunded
all men to set fyer in al places of the toune (the holy places only except)
the fayre market place was set on fyer, &amp; the subburbes brent ardātly.
Wherfore all men were commaunded to their standardes, and aboute
vi. of the clocke the army retreted, and as thei passed they brent the villages
and places. And when night approched they drewe together and
and all that night lay on land abidyng their enemies. And the next day
with honor they tooke their shippes, and when all menne were shipped
and fewe or none missed. The lorde Admyrall cōmaunded .xvi. or .xvii.
shippes small and great liyng in the hauen to be brent. Then they sailed
furth and came to anker before saint Polle de Lyon, then he commaunded
that the foyst and other smal shippes and great botes should
be manned to enter into an harborow for shippes called pympoll or
pympole, which was sone done, the boates entred ye place &amp; some lāded,
but then the Brytons were to strong &amp; so they tooke their boates &amp; bet
the Britons on the shore, &amp; the Brytons shotte great ordinaunce at the
Englishemen, but it did them no harme, and yet the Englishmen brent
a shippe of .CC. and many small vessels. When tyme came the whole
flete sailed into the hauen of Brest and with barkes and rowe barges
entered the hauen and toke land, and some Englishemen did so muche
that they set 
                        •
                     yer in hou
                        •
                     es nere the castle. And euen as thenglishemen
sayled by the cost, the Brytons them askryed and fortefied the lādyng
places▪ yet dayly the Englishemen skyrmished with the Brytons and
came safely to their shippes againe: with this watre was all the duchy
of Brytaigne sore troubled.
                  When the lorde Admirall had wonne the toune of Morles as you
haue heard. He called to him certaine squyers whom for their hardynes
and noble courage he made knightes, 
                        •
                     yrst sir Fraunces Bryan, sir Anthony
Broune, sir Richard Cornwall, sir Thomas More, sir Eyles
Huse, sir Ihon Russel, sir Ihon Raynsford, sir George Cobham, sir Ihō
Cornwalles, sir Edward Rigley and diuers other, And after he wrote
letters to the kyng of his good spede: In the whiche he muche praised
and all gentlemen and souldiers for their hardynes. When he had sayled
a while on the seas, he had letters sent from the king that he should
retreyte, and so he came withall his flete vnder the Isle of Wyght to a
place called the Kow, and then he departed from his shippe and came
to Estamstede the .xxi. day of Iulye to the kyng, of whom he was well
welcomed you may be sure. And so on mounday the .xxiii. day of Iuly
the kyng and he came to London to the Cardynals place and there sat
in counsaile to determine what should be done. After this the kyng
dyned with the Cardinall the .xxiii. day of Iulye, where he rehersed
that he had knowlege that the Amyrall of Britaigne was in Morles
with a C. horsemen and a C. crosbowes, and yet he fledde, and the kyng
muche cōmended the lorde Admyral for his paind and hardynes, and
praised theim of his garde, and specially fiftie, whiche left pylferyng

and neuer went from the lorde capitaine.
                  On the third day of Iuly while this enterprise was done at Morles,
certaine Frenchemen to the nomber of CCC. horsemen came nere to the
castle of Guysnes and kept theim selfe in a close couert and so appered
viii. or x. horsemen and came nere Guysnes: out of the Castle came viii.
Englishe archers and issued out of the gate and fell with the Frenche
horsemen in skyrmished: to the Frenchemennes, reskue came iiii. men of
armes and skyrmished with the archers whiche were a fote. Then out
of Guysnes issued xii. dimilances all Welshemen and rāne boldely to ye
Frenchemen in reskue of the fotemen, Then the whole bend of Frenchemen
issued out and set on the Welshemen, the fotemen shotte while arrowes
lasted and were faine to fight with swordes, the Welshmen kept
themselfes together and entred into the bend of Frenchemen and brake
their speres and then fought so with swordes that they made away, so
that thei escaped from the bend of CCC. horsemen, and of the Frenchemen
were slayne iii. men and v. horse, the fotemen were ouerpressed and
solde their liues dere, for the Frenchemen slew them all and would take
none prisoner, they were so angry with the kyllyng of their horse.
                  Also the xxv. day of Iuly sir Wylly am Sandes treasorer of Caleys
and sir Edward Guilforde Marshall, with banners spred, issued out of
Caleys with xiiii.C. menne and went into the Frenche pale lokyng for
Mounsire Foyat whiche was a great mocker and a coward: But when
he appeared not they went to Whitsand baye and set it on fyer, and the
people fled to the churche whiche was fortified and stode at defence, the
body of the churche was wonne and then they toke the steple and some
yelded themselfes, but the remnant by counsail of a priest mainteined so
long that the Steple was fyred and then the priest cried succour, but it
was to late and so the Frenche people was fayne to lepe the Steple &amp;
diuers perished, &amp; they that were saued wer led to Caleys as prisoners.
Farther the xxiii. daye of thesame moneth Thwaites a capitaine of an
Englishe shippe tooke land beside Bullein, and went vp thre myle into
the countrey to a toune called Newe Castle and forryed all the countrey
and in his returne set fyer on the toune &amp; brent a great part therof
maugre the Bullenoys, and with his bowes and men whiche only was
vi. score, he put backe lxxx. Hagbushes and CCC. men of warre of the
countrey and so came to their shippe with all the botie and lost no mā,
notwithstandyng they were sore folowed to their shippe.
                  On the vi. day of Iuly the Cardynall satte in the starre chamber at
Westminster where he sayd, my Lordes it is reason that you should
know the honorable enterprise done by the lorde Admiral and his compaigny
in Brytaigne whiche hath dispoyled and destroyed the great
toune of Morles in Brytaigne with all the villages and countrey

adioynyng to thesame, whiche is in the Frenche dominion, whiche mischiefe
had neuer risen if Fraunces the Frenche kyng had kept his othe
and promise. For he is bound that he should neuer retayne the Swyches
from the Emperor, nor that he shall not inuade any of the Emperors
landes or dominions, whiche he hath done, for he hath inuaded the
coūtrey of Henaude and Cambrises and taken Hedyng and Fountraby
with many other iniuryes. For when the kyng sent me and other to
his great costes the last yere to Caleys to treate a vnitie and peace betwene
theim, all our saiynges were by the Frenche kyng turned into a mocquery.
Also cōtrary to his promise he hath suffered Duke Ihon of
Albany to enter the realme of Scotland to the great perill of the yong
kyng, Nephieu to our soueraigne lorde, and also entendeth to mary the
the Quene of Scottes contrary to the kynges honor. The sayd
Frenche kyng also witholdeth the kynges dueties &amp; his systers dower:
wherfore of necessitie the kyng is entered into warre, for no prince will
suffre the wrong that the French kyng offereth him as an vntrue &amp; forsworne
prince, wherfore for your owne welth you must now ayde your
prince, trustyng to punishe and chastice him to your great honor and
fame.
                  Then by commaundement wer all Frechemen and Scottes imprisoned
and the goodes seazed, and all suche as were denizens were commaunded
to shewe their letters patentes, &amp; suche as were allowed had
all their goodes and the other not, and all Frenchemen and Scottes
that had maryed Englishewomen, the wifes and children had halfe the
goodes deliuered vnto them, and euery denizen to fynde suertie for his
good abearyng, and al the other if they would be bayled to fynde suerties
for their trueth and allegeaunce or els to be kept in prison, for the
portes were so kept that they could not flye.
                  The kyng nowe beyng entered into the warres thought not to slepe
and let the Frenche kyng alone, wherfore by his letters he commaūded
certain persones with their powers to come to Lōdon in August. They
that wer appointed came accordyngly, euery man with suche a nomber
as to him was appointed, and when they had mustered at London before
the kynges Commissioners they were nere xii.M. menne with the
Pyoners, and they wer sent to the lorde Admyral whiche lay at Douer
with iiii.M. mē, but because haruest was not done, ye vitaile at Caleys
was to litle for so great an armye, wherfore they lay in Kent at tounes
there a good space, whiche made vitaile dere there.
                  In this sommer the lorde Rosse and the lorde Dacres of the North
whiche were appointed to kepe the borders against Scotland did so
valiantly that they burned the good toune of Kelsy and lxxx. villages
and ouerthrew xviii. towers of stone with all their Barnkyns or Bulwerkes.
                  
                     
The kyng also in this moneth was credibly enformed that the duke
of Albany prepared an army royal of Scottes and Frenchemen to inuade
England▪ Wherfore the kyng appointed the Erle of Shrewsbury
his lorde Steward to be his Lieutenaunt generall against the sayd
Duke and his inuasions, whiche directed his letters to the shyres of
Yorke, Darby, Stafford, Shropshyre and al other beyond Trent that
all menne should be in a readynes.
                  The xx. day of August the Cardynall sent for the Maior, Aldermen
and the moste substanciallest comminers of the Citie of London,
where he declared to theim that the kyng had appointed commissioners
through the whole realem for England for to swere euery
manne of what value he is in mouables, the more to be in readynes
for the defence of this realme. And the kyng for the loue he
beareth you would haue syt with you himselfe, but for certayne other
affayres in his warres to be done he is letted, and so hath appointed
me your Commissioner. Wherefore in conuenient tyme certifye
me the nomber of all suche as be worth one hundreth poundes
and vpwarde, to the entent I may sweare theim of their values:
for fyrst the kyng asketh of you your louyng heartes and due obeysaunce,
the whiche shall appeare by your conformitie to his requestes,
and when the value is taken the desyreth onely the tenth part of
goodes and landes whiche is the least reasonable thyng that you can
ayde your prince with. I thynke euerye one of you wyll offer no
lesse, as for the spiritualtie euery manne is in the shyres sworne and
shall and wyll gladly pay the fowerth part to the kyng and liue on the
iii. partes. Nowe to your part I am sure you wyll not grudge, therfore
name me the menne of substaunce and for the meanet sorte, meaner
Commissioners shall be appointed. Sir sayd a marchaunt if it may
please you, how shal this tenth part to the kyng be deliuered? in money
plate or Iuels sayd the Cardinall at a value. O my lorde sayd
the Aldermen it is not yet two monethes sithe the kyng had of the
Citie xx. thousand pound in ready money in loane, whereby the Citie
is very bare of money, for Goddes sake remembre this that riche marchauntes
in ware be bare of money: Well sayd the Cardynall, this
must be done and therefore go about it. So the Aldermen resorted to
their Wardes and named suche as they iudged to be of that value,
whiche came before the Cardynall and moste humbly besought him
that they might not be sworne for the true value of their substaunce for
the true valuacion to theim was vnknowen and many honest mennes
credence was better then his substance, and therefore they doubted the
paril of periury. Well sayd the Cardinall sythe you dread the cryme of
periurye, it is a signe of grace, and therefore I will for you borowe
of the kyng a lytie. Make you your bylles of your owne value

likely to report your fame and then more busynes nedeth not for you
see what two costly armyes the kyng hath ready against bothe Fraunce
and Scotland, therfore nowe shewe your selfes lyke louyng subiectes,
for you be able inough. And I dare sweare the substance of London is
no lesse worth then two Myllions of golde. Then sayd the citezens we
would to God that it were so, and the citie is sore appaired by the great
occupiyng of straungers. Well sayd the Cardinal it shalbe redressed if
I liue: But on Saterday next I shall appoint one to receiue your
bylles, and he that is of credence more then of substance let him resorte
to me and I will be secrete and good to him. Thus the Citezens departed
in great agony saiyng, that at the last loane some lent the fifth
part and nowe to haue the tenth part was to muche. And here note wel
that the x. thousand poundes that was lent was not taken as the xx. of
euery mannes substaūce, but it should be allowed as part of the x. part,
and this valuacion should performe vp the whole x. part. Great was
the mournyng of the common people as it is euer in suche cases of paymentes.
But in the ende one doctor Tonnys a secretary to the Cardinal
came to the Chapiter house of Poules, and to him the citezens brought
in their bylles and on their honestie they were receiued, whiche values
afterwarde turned them to displeasure.
                  The spiritualtie made suite to the lorde Cardinal that no temporal
men should sit to examyne them, to be made priuy to their possessions &amp;
goodes: wherfore bishoppes and Abbottes were appointed commissioners
to take the value of their snbstaunce.
                  In this season was great plentie of vitaile sent to Caleys, and to the
lorde Admyral were sent Tentes and Pauilions some of lxx. lodgynges
for him and other noblemen.
                  The Friday beyng the xxii. day of August certain Welshemen were
lodged at a poore village named Cause, because in Caleys was verye
narow lodgyng, and thesame night CCCC. Frenchmen passed by Caleys
hauē for lacke of good watche and came into thesame village and
set fyer in the house where the Welshemen lay, whiche ranne awaye naked
into the Marishe and saued themselfes, but their horses wer taken.
This chaunce happened for lacke of good watche.
                  When the lorde Admyrall had brought all his menne out of the
shippes and that all the souldiors were come out of Englande and the
ordinaunce set on land, then came into Caleys hauen xiiii. shyppes out
of Spayne from the Emperor whiche set on land CCC. Spanyardes
whiche were sent to serue the lorde Admyrall and vnder him they were
put. When all thinges were ready, the lorde Admyral set in order his
battels and for the forewarde he appointed sir Robert Ratcleffe, lorde
Fitzwater for Capitayne, and with him diuers knightes and gentlemen
whiche capitaine kept his men in very good order.
                  
                     After that battail folowed the ordinaunce, artilerie and other trusses
with vitail and all necessaries, &amp; for the capitaine of the horsemen was
appoined sir Edward Gyldford, by whom the currers and vewers of
the countrey were appointed. The myddle warde ledde the lorde Admyrall
himselfe, and in his compaignie the lorde Edmond Hawarde
his brother, with many worshipfull knightes, squiers and tall yomen:
The last battail was ledde by two valiaunt knightes of the Garter sir
Wyllyam Sandes and sir Richard Wyngfelde, and with theim was
sir Richard Iernyngham with many other. In good order of battail
they passed ouer Newnam bridge the .xxx. day of August to a place
called Calkewell &amp; there lodged betwene ye Wyndmyl &amp; the marrishe.
                  Thesame day came to the lorde Admyrall a certain nombe of wilde
persones, as menne out of seruice and apprentises that ranne frō their
Masters and other ydle persones, and him desired that they might be
retained in the kinges wages, to whom he answered, that the kyng had
appointed the nōbre of suche as should haue wages, whiche was fully
complete and aduised theim to returne into England and not to loyter
there. Then sayd a tall yoman, my lorde here be many good felowes
that with your fauor would ieopard to get or lose, for their mynde is to
be reuenged on the Frenchemen enemies to the kyng and his realme.
                  Good felowe sayd the lorde Admyrall, their myndes be good, but if for
lacke of conduite they should be cast awaye, it were a losse to the kyng
and a great corage to the Frenchemen. Then all the compaignie cried,
let vs go in the name of God and sainct George: Then after counsail
takē he gaue them a Penon of sainct George and bad them aduenture
(of whiche they were called aduenturers) and farther bad theim that if
they got any botie they should euer bryng it to tharmy, and thei should
be payde to the vttermost, and then he gaue them money and cōmaunded
them weapons &amp; so the sayd .xxxi. day the sayd aduenturers .iiii.C.
in nombre and mo, sette forwarde before the host, but how they did, you
shall heare afterwarde.
                  Monday the fyrst day of September the armye remoued towarde
Guisnes, which day was very hote &amp; drinke lacked, and water was not
nere, so that some died for faintnes, &amp; this night they laye at Guysnes.
                  Tewsday the second day of September the armye passed towarde
Arde: And in the golden Ualay where the kyng of England and the
Frenchekyng met two yeres before, there met with tharmy of England
two capitaines of the Burgonions, the one called the erle of Egemond
the Seneschal of Henaude, and the lorde for Bauers Admyral of Flaū
                     ders
with v.C. horsemen, like men of warre. The lord Admyral in gentle
maner receiued these two capitaines and their compaignie &amp; so they
ioyned theimselfes to the Englishe armye, and the same day they tooke
lodgyng at Arde south from the toune, where they were wel vitailed, &amp;
there lay wednisday all day, and the Burgonyons lay vnder the castle
of Mountorrey. The next day they remoued to the vale of Lyekes, &amp;

there encāped themselfes. Sir George Cobham thesame day wt .ii.M.
men, by the Admyralles cōmaūdement came to the toune of Selloys &amp;
set fyer in the toune, &amp; when the toune was on fyer he assauted the castle.
They within made resistence, but it auayled not, for the walles wer entred
&amp; the souldiers taken, and the castle set on fyer, &amp; with gunpouder
ouerthrew the walles: then wt hast he remoued to a toune called Brune
bridge and set it on fyer, and also brent a toune called Senekerke, and
also the tounes of Botyngham and Manstier &amp; so returned to the lorde
Admyrall whiche gaue him great thankes, The Frenchemen appered
in plumpes, but yet they durst not reskue their tounes.
                  On saterday the lorde Admyrall remoued with the whole army to a
ground beside sainct Nerbyns and there lay all sonday beyng the .vii.
day of September, where he sent diuers companies out, whiche forraged
the coūtreys &amp; brent many villages as farre as thei might trauail:
the lorde Admyrall caused the toune of Narbyn to be brent, &amp; tooke the
castle and rased it and vtterly destroyed it.
                  On Monday the .viii. day, he remoued to Dauerne and brent all the
tounes as he passed, and liyng there, he brent the toune of Dauerne and
cast doune the castle of Columberge &amp; the castle Rew, but the churches
of Dauerne and a house of Nonnes were saued by his cōmaundement.
                  Thesame day was brent saint Marie de Boys and all the countrey
twelue myle about was of light fyer, the people fledde and left tounes
and Castelles full of wyne, corne, and all other necessaries, so that in
Dauerne the Englishmen found great plentie, whiche or they went away
they set a fyer.
                  The ix. day of Septembre the whole armye came before the toune of
Boyardes in whiche was a Church more liker a castle then a Church,
for it was depe dyched with drawe brydges and with Bulwarkes fortefied
and lopes very warlike, The Admyrall beholdyng it sayd, this
is like no house of praier. Then he commaūded his people to entre the
dyches and plucke doune the drawe bridges and set fyer in ye Churche,
and with gunpouder ouerthrew it, and brent the toune and all the villages
adiacent to the same, the people cried and fledde, well was he that
might saue himselfe.
                  The .x. day, thei came to the toune of Uaus, which was nye the toune
called Foucamberge and there a company of Frenchmen were askried,
for out of a wod they shewed themselfes, but they taryed not long, but
without profer of encountre they departed. Wherfore the whole army
toke their campe &amp; there lay till the .xiii. day which was saterday, euery
day s

they toke the 
                        •
                     ay to Frynge of F
                        •
                     ynges, and there brent the toune and
destroyed the castle whiche was very strong.
                  The Sonday beyng the .xiiii. day, the lorde Admyral with his compaigny
in great raine and yll wether passed by hilles and valeys verye
painefully, and with great labor came to a toune called Blaniow, and

there taried monday all day, &amp; there all day counsailed the capitaines
both of England, and Flaūders or Burgon what was best to be done.
                  On tewsday in the mornyng came a trumpet from the Castle of Hedyng
and desired to speake with the capitaine,Message frō Hedyng. whiche incontinent sent
for him: my lorde capitaine sayd the trumpet, the capitaine of Hedyng
desireth you to come thither and see the place, and on the walles he wil
bryng you good lucke, and he prayeth you not to hurt the dere in his
parke, and for any other hurt you can do him he careth not: well sayd
the lorde Admyrall, I will send him answere by my trumpet.The answ
                           •
                        r Incontinent
he called a trumpet and bad him go to Hedyng to Mounsire de
Bees and to say to him that he would come to the castle of Hedyng, &amp;
if he slay any of my menne with his artillerie, let him trust me, that if I
gette the castle I shall saue neither man, woman, nor childe. So with
that message the trumpet departed &amp; declared it to Mounsire de Bees,
whiche sayd that it was spoken of noble corage, and so the trumpet returned,
and thesame day the campe was remoued and the whole army
came about the castle of Hedyng,Hedyng 
                           〈◊〉
                        . at whiche tyme the toune of Hedyng
was sore infecte with pestilence, wherefore a generall commaundement
was geuen that no mā should ones come into the toune, howbeit some
of the Burgonyans did and set fyre in the houses.
                  When the siege was planted, the ordinaunce was very light for the
wayes were so depe and the grounde so wet that the great ordinaunce
could not be caried. This thing was well debated by the lord Admiral
and the capitaines. After they had been there .xi. dayes, fyrst they considered
that the castle could not be obtained without great ordinaunce,
whiche in no wise could then be caried, and also if they with the light
ordinaūce shotyng should spend all their pouder and not get the castle
than in theim might be reckened great foly, and also they should be in
great ieopardie to passe without ordinaunce, and further the plage began
sore in the armye, wherfore they determined to leaue the siege and
returne. But while they lay at y• toune they bet doune roffes, galleries,
chymnies, and suche other thinges as the light ordinaunce would bete
doune, whiche sore defaced the beautie of the castle. Thei also destroied
all the dere in the Parke, whiche were falowe dere and left none for the
capitaine. The Englishemen were clerely determined to haue assauted
the castle if the Burgonions would haue done thesame:The cause why the castle was not assa
                           •
                        
                        ̄
                        ted. but they refused,
whiche seyng the Englishmen left the assaut alone: For though the
Englishemen had gotten it, it should haue been deliuered to the Emperours
vse by the treatie, fbr he claymed it as his inheritaunce, whiche
caused the Englishemen to leaue the assaut.
                  And so the .xxii. day of September they rered the siege and set theim
selfes in good order of battail and passed styl onwarde til they came to
Dorlans and brent the toune,The siege raised. and rased the castle, and frō thence came
to the good toune of Darrier and brent and spoyled thesame. Thus he
brent all the way as he passed: and euer the wether was worse, and men

fell sicke, wherfore the Burgonions and the Spaniardes returned into
Flaunders about Betwyn.
                  Then the lorde Admyrall saw that it was no tyme to kepe the felde,
turned bacward in good ordre of battail &amp; came to Calaice the .xvi. day
of October. And while he lay at Calayce he sent out sir Willyā Sandes,
sir Morice Barkeley, sir Willyam Fitzwillyam with .iii.M. men,
whiche brent Marguyson whiche was newly edified and fortefied, thei
brent also the toune of sainct Iohnes Rhode &amp; Temple toune, &amp; many
villages. At this voiage wer takē many prisoners .xiiii.M. shepe, xiiii.

                      &amp; Kyen, &amp; xiii.C. hogges, and .vi.C. Mares &amp;
Horses, with this great botie this crew returned to Calayce in safetie.
                  Then y• lord Admyral sent sir Ihon Walop with .ix.C. men to saint
Omers to lye there and at Guysnes, Hammes, and at Marke, &amp; at Oy
he left another nombre and left capitaines to ouerse them, &amp; al the soudiers
had a monethes wages payde them &amp; to returned into England.
                  The aduenturers taried stil and gat many good prayes, &amp; brought
to the garrisons, and lacked nothyng: they were muche drad of all the
common people, for of them they had great prayes, and dayly learned
feates of warre whiche made them the bolder.
                  When the lorde Admirall had set all thinges in an order on that side
the sea, he toke shippe &amp; with the Nauy came into the riuer of Thames
and so to the kyng, of whom he was well welcommed &amp; not vnworthy.
                  In this season were banished out of Southwarke xii. Scottes whiche
had dwelt there a long season &amp; wer conueied frō parishe to parishe
by the constable like men y• hadabiured the realme, &amp; on their vttermost
garment a white crosse before &amp; another behynd them. Thus were they
conucyed through London Northwarde till they came to Scotlande.
                  While the lord Admyral was this in Fraunce destroiyng the countrey,
the noble Erle of Shrewsbury lorde George Talbot &amp; Steward
of the kynges houshold prepared by the kynges commaundement a
great army toward Scotland: for the kyng was enformed that Duke
Ihon of Albany (whiche in ye Parliament of Scotland was made lord
gouernor of the realme and of the yong kyng duryng his nonage) had
raised a mightie &amp; puissaunt host of Scottes to the nomber of, lxxx.M.
men as after was well knowen, whiche were warlike appointed, &amp; that
he with .v.C. Frenchemen with handgunnes and other great artillerie
was cōmyng forward to inuade the west Marches of England adioynyng
towarde Scotland. Wherefore the kyng sent worde to therle of
Shrewsbury, which with all diligēce like a noble capitain set forward
towarde Yorke, &amp; wrote to therles of Northumberland, Westmerland
and Darby, to the lorde Dacres, Lumley, Clyfford, Scrope, Latemer,
Ogle, Darcy, Conyers, &amp; to all other gentlemen to be ready wtin .viii.
houres warnyng with all their powers, and so in iorniyng, he with his
power whiche was great, came to the citie of Yorke abidyng the ordinaunce,
and the lordes and all other thynges necessary in suche a case.
                  
                     
In the meane season the Scottes wer come nigh to the citie of Carleyle
and lodged them nigh the water of Eske not farre from Sulway
sandes, &amp; there made their abode. Therle of Westmerland, ye lord Dacres,
the lorde Roos, the lorde Mountaigle, with the knightes of Lancashere,
Westmerland &amp; Cumberland were ready with .xxviii.M. men
to haue geuen them battail.
                  When the Scottes sawe that they could not come into Englād with
out battail, the lordes of Scotland drew to counsail, and amongest all
one wyseman sayd, my lordes, hether be we come by the cōmaundement
of my lorde Gouernor the duke of Albany,The saiyngor a Scottishe Erle. but for what ause the warre
is we should know: you al remēbre that the last warre was to ye realme
of Scotland muche preiudiciall: For kyng Iames the .iiii. brought the
realme of Scotlād to the best that euer it was: and by his warre it was
brought to ye worst almost that may be, for by that warre was he &amp; his
nobilitie slaine, whiche Scotlād sore lamēteth: Wherfore by myne aduice
let vs go to ye duke &amp; know of him the cause. Thē thei al came to y•
dukes court, &amp; therle of Arrayn an aūcient mā spake for thē al &amp; sayd,
my lord Gouernor, by your wil &amp; cōmaūdement here is assēbled almost
all ye nobilitie of Scotland wt their power vpō a pretence to entre into
Englād, my lordes here would know ye cause &amp; quarel why this war is
begon, if it might please your goodnes, it shuld wel satisfie their mīdes
                  The duke studied a good while &amp; sayd: this questiō would haue been
demaūded or now:The answere of the duke of Albany. For well you know yt I for the very loue that I bere
to ye realme of Scotlād, of the whiche I haue my name, honor &amp; linage.
I haue passed ye seas out of ye noble realme of Fraūce into this realme
of Scotlād. One great cause to bryng you to a vnitie when you wer in
deuision: By reason of which deuision your realme was likely to be cō
                     quered
&amp; destroyed. Also ye Frenche kyng by my suites &amp; interessiō wil
ioyne wt you in ayde against thenglishe nacion: &amp; when this war was
determined in ye parliament, you made me capitain, authorisyng me to
inuade Englād wt bāner displaied: then was no questiō demaūded of y•
right or quarel, &amp; that that I haue is by your assent &amp; agrement, &amp; that
I will iustifie: But to answer your demaūde, my thynke you haue iust
cause to inuade Englād with fyer, sworde, &amp; bloud, if you be not to for
getfull, &amp; without you will beare dishonor &amp; reproche for euer: For you
know that this realme of Scotlād is our inheritaūce as a porcion of y•
worlde alotted to our nacion &amp; aūcetors whō we succede: Then where
may be better warre then to mainteine this our natural inheritaūce, is
not daily seen the great inuasions y• thenglishmen on vs make, ye great
māslaughters &amp; murders with robberies &amp; spoiles that they do dayly?
Is not this a cause of warre? To defēd the coūtrey is y• office of a king,
the honor of noble men &amp; the very seruice of chiualry, &amp; the dutie natural
of ye cominaltie. For I thinke it a iust quarel if we might cōquere the
realme of Englād &amp; annex it to our realme &amp; make a Monarchie: For
sith ye beginning of our habitacion in this Isle of Britaigne, that naciō
&amp; we haue been enemies, &amp; vs they haue euer hated, &amp; yet we haue euer
withstode thē til at ye last battail of Branxston where we by chaūce lost

our soueraigne lorde &amp; many noble men, but that was by treason of his
lord chāberlain, &amp; yet I thinke we wan ye felde: which murther I thinke
all we noble men ought to reuenge. Therfore I would that you should
coragiously auaūce your self in this quarel to get honor &amp; to be reuēged
                  Then a sad mā called the president of the coūsail sayd, my lorde: Fortune
of war is led by him that all ledeth, &amp; he striketh the stroke, we can
worke no miracles, &amp; here are y• lordes of Englād redy to encountre vs,
and surely they will fight, for their power shal encreace daily and ours
is at the hyest. And if God geue vs ye victory as I trust he wil, yet haue
we not won the feld. For redy cōming is ye lord Talbot erle of Shrewsbury
so muche drad in Fraūce as you know wel, with a great puissaūt
army, &amp; there is no doubt but the kyng of Englād wil send or bryng another
army, if we should chaūce to gette the 
                        •
                     yrst battail: if we get the
ii. feld, that wil not be wtout losse of many nobles, by reason wherof the
realme shalbe weaker. And if we be ouercome, how many shalbe slaine
god knoweth: They y• fle be worthy to be reputed as traitors to ye king
&amp; so by wilfulnes &amp; folishe hardynes y• realme shalbe in ieopardie to be
vndone, &amp; I say, while the kyng is wtin age, we ought to moue no war,
sith by war we may bring him to distruccion. Alas sayd y• duke, here is
al ye puissaūce of Scotlād: if we returne, we shal encorage our enemies,
&amp; the realme of Scotlād shal euer be rebuked &amp; defamed. All this communicacion
in coūsail was written 
                        •
                     y one sir Lother priest &amp; Scot and
secretary to ye quene of Scottes, whiche was a secretary there in y• host
at that tyme, to a Scottishe priest y• dwelt in Lōdon: &amp; farther he wrote
that the Scottishe king did muche for the Frenche kynges pleasure to
draw the lordes of Englād wt their powers toward that partie &amp; to put
the kyng of Englād to charges, so that he should not inuade Fraunce.
                  After this cōmunicacion the quene of Scottes whiche doubted the sequele
of this matter, sēt worde to the duke &amp; him required to comon of a
peace wt the warden of thenglishe Marches, whiche sent an Herauld to
the lord Daker then warden of y• west Marches, y• lord Daker agreed,
&amp; vpō hostages wēt to the duke of Albany into his cāpe, where y• quene
of Scottes by that tyme was come, &amp; so ther was an abstinence of war
taken for a season: and in the meane tyme the duke and the quene promised
to send Ambassa
                        •
                     ors to the kyng of England to cōlude a peace:
And thus y• Scottes returned into their houses. This truce was takē
the xi. day of Septēber betwene Englād &amp; Scotlād this xiiii. yere of y•
kyng. Therle of Shrewsbury hearing of the truce by the lord Dacres
letters returned with al his cōpany, sory that he had not gone forward
on the Scottes. In this season the cōmissioners sat for the loane of the
x. part of euery mans substaunce in euery shyre, the people were sworne
and some auaunsed them selfes more then thei were worth of pride, not
remembryng what was comyng, and the commissioners did what they
could to set the people to the vttermoste, whiche afterwarde turned the
people to muche heauines, &amp; by reason of this, great summes of money
were leuied, but the moste part were not content, because the loane was
so sodainly payed. But vnder the value of .v. pound no mā lent a peny.

The .vii. day of October was .iiii.M. pound payde to the citie of London
whiche was lent for a priuate cause about the loane of the .x. part.
                  In this yere the bakers of London came and tolde the Mayre that
corne would be dere, whervpon he and thaldermen made prouision for
xv.C. quarters, &amp; when it was come thei would bye none, and made the
cōmon people beleue that it was musty, because they would vtter their
owne, so that the lorde Cardynal was faine to proue it, and found the
bakers false and commaunded them to bye it.
                  The xvi. day of October the kyng lay at Hitchyn in Hartford shyre
to see this Haukes 
                        •
                     lye, and by chaunce, there the kynges lodgyng
was on fyer &amp; he is great feare, but in no i
                        •
                     opardie, and so the kyng
came shortly to London and sent for the Mayre and dyuers comyners
and to them gaue thankes for many kyndnes whiche they thought they
had well deserued.
                  The warre thus cōtinuyng betwene the Frenche kyng and the kyng
of England, there was a valiaunt capitane Constable of the castle of
Hammes vnder the lorde Mount
                        •
                     oy called sir Richard Whethyll, the
Frēchemen him somuche hated that thei deuised a policie to take him, &amp;
so on Christmasday at night there issued out of Bullain CC. horsmen
and CCC. fotemen, and somuche they trauailed that all together were
come to a place where Hoppes grew, nere Hammes castle called Catte
Hall. When they were come thither, they kept theimselfes couert, and
in the mornyng they brake vp the Turne pyke by sainct Gertrudes:
Then sent they into Hammes Marshe .ix. or .x. fotemen to take cattell.
In the castle the alarme rang, but the embushment kept theim stil close:
The constable perceiued what the alarme ment, and armed him, &amp; so did
his archers, and toke his horse, and thre gētlemen went on fote by him.
The Frenchmen of purpose driued the cattel here &amp; there as though it
would not be driuen, sir Richard Whethyll pursued them. When the
driuers sawe him, they droue the cattel into a great felde: then were the
bushment of horsmen and fotemen betwene him and sainct Gertrudes,
and they sodaynly brake out on him, and the thre gentlemen on foote
fought valiantly but they were slaine, the knight alighted and fought
on fote manfully, but he was borne doune with pykes, and sore wounded
and so was compelled to yelde himselfe prisoner: by that tyme wer
xxx. archers come out of the castle, and when they sawe the great nomber
of the Frenchemen, then they knewe that their capitaine was betrayed
and so returned.
                  In this Christmas whiche was kept at Eltham, the Cardinal made
dyuers reformacions for the kynges housholde, and all they that had
no masters were commaunded to auoyde.
                  The .xxvii. day of February sir Ihon Walop knight sent .lx. auenturers
from Guysnes to seke auentures, and they mette with a gentlemanne
called Thomas Palmer whiche went with them. And out of a
castle betwene Bullaine and Marguyson called Hadyngham came
out .lxxx. Frenchemen with Pykes and Crosbowes, and sette on the
same Palmer whiche him defended.
                  
                     
Al his cōpany sauyng, xxiii. persons wer gone about to seke their pray.
These .xxiii. persones him manfully succoured &amp; after the Frenchemen
had slaine his horse and wounded him, his company slewe .iii. Frenchemen
and toke xxv. and liue whiche were all hurt &amp; so wer thenglishmen,
for the Frenchemen fought sore. All these prisoners were brought to
Guisnes, &amp; the remnant of thaduenturers returned with muche cattel.
                  The last day of February .lx. Englishmen archers &amp; bilmen came to a
place called saint Anthonies nere to Marguison &amp; entred ye houses and
fell a spoilyng: The Frenchmen wer therof aduertised by a spy, &amp; came
on &amp; set on a few Englishmen which wer together: then with noise other
of thenglishmen approched, so they were .xl. persones. Then came out a
freshe embushment of Frenchmen &amp; set on thenglishmen &amp; so slewe .xi. &amp;
toke xx. prisoners &amp; the other scaped.The duke of Albany returned. About this time ye duke of Albany
sailed out of Scotlād into Fraūce, &amp; the French king somuche fauored
him, yt as it was shewed to the kyng of Englād for trueth, that when ye
Frenche king rode through Parys he rode on y• one hand &amp; Richard de
la Pole a traytor to Englād &amp; by parliament attainted on y• other hād,
&amp; that the duke had asked of the Frēche kyng v.M. horsemen &amp; .x.M.
Almaines, &amp; that he had promised ye French kyng if he had those .xv.M.
men, he would do one of these .iii. thynges, either sley y• kyng of Englād
in battail, or els take him prisoner, or els driue him out of his realme.
These were shamefull bragges of a noble man and very folishe.
                  Ye haue hard before how truce was taken by ye duke of Albany &amp; the
lord Da
                        •
                     res for a season betwene Englād &amp; Scotlād &amp; that Ambassadors
should be sent to ye king of Englād, so it was y• in October accordyng
to their accustomed doublenes they sent .iii. personages of small
behauor as it semed▪ as Ambassadors frō Scotlād: they wer smally regarded
&amp; shortly departed. Their Cōmission was to know whether the
same tyme or abstinēce of warre was by ye king assēted to or not,Ambassade frō S
                           •
                        otlād. &amp; other
cōmission had thei none. Thus thei ment craftely as you may perceiue,
for in suche troublous tyme they may steale vnpunished, whiche they
may not do in tyme of peace. Wherfore the kyng to be sure of them sent
for Hēry the .v. erle of Northūberland &amp; him made warden of the whole
Marches which thākefully accepted thesame, &amp; so departed lord Warden.
But how soeuer it happened he made suite to y• kyng &amp; his coūsail
&amp; neuer left, till he was discharged of thesame, &amp; then therle of Surray
lord Admyral of Englād was made general warden, &amp; the lord Marques
Dorset was made Warden of thest Marches &amp; Myddil, and the
lorde Dacres of the west Marches: whiche .iii. lordes sped them thether
the vi. day of March for y• defence of the borders. For refusyng of this
office th
                        •
                     rle of Northūberland was not regarded of his owne tenaūtes
which disdained him and his blod and muche lamēted his foly, and all
men estemed him without hart or loue of honor and chiualrie.
                  The kyng out of hād sent cōmissions to gather ye loane, this was called
the practisyng of the loane,The 
                           •
                        oane gathered. which sore emptied mens purses. In the
same moneth were musters taken through the realme &amp; euery ma commaūded
to be ready within a dayes warnyng to do the kyng seruice in

harnes, which caused euery man of honesty to bye harnes and weapon.
                  The lorde Marques Dorset warden of the East Marches betwene
England &amp; Scotland accompanied with sir Willyam Bulmer and sir
Arthur Darcy and many other noble men, the second day of April then
beyng shere thursday entred into Tyuedale &amp; so .x. myle into Galoway
and brent on euery side townes and villages, and the Scottes in great
nomber shewed themselfes on the hylles &amp; did not approche, &amp; so he all
that night taried in the Scottishe ground &amp; on good Friday returned
with their botie whiche was .iiii.M. head of nete into England, when
they had brent Grymslay, Mowhouse, Dufforde mylles, Ackeforthe,
Crowlyng, Nowes maner, Midder Crowling, Marbottel, Low Bog,
Sefforth Maner, Myddyl rigge, Primsed, Broket, Shawes Haruel,
wide open Haught &amp; other tounes &amp; villages, &amp; yet lost not many men.
                  The .xv. day of April beganne a Parliament at the blacke Fryers
in Lōdon, &amp; that day the Masse of the holy ghost was song, all the lordes
beyng present in their Parliament robes. And when Masse was
finished the kyng came into the Parliament chamber and there satte
doune in the seate royall or throne, and at his fete on the right side satte
the Cardynal of Yorke &amp; the Archebishop of Cantorbury, &amp; at the raile
behind stode doctor Tūstal bishop of Lōdon, which made to the whole
Parliament an eloquent Oracion, declaryng to the people the office of
a kyng. Fyrst he must be a man of iudgement accordyng to the saiyng
of the Prophet Dauid Deus iudicium tuum regi da, &amp;c.
                     The Oracion of Doctor Tūstal bishop of London. Also he must be
a man of great learnyng according to the saiyng of the Prophete, Erudimini
qui iudicatis 
                           •
                        erram. Accordyng to whiche saiynges he sayd that
God had sent vs a prince of great iudgment, of great lernyng, &amp; great
experience, whiche accordyng to his princely dutie forgat not to studye
to sette forwarde all thynges whiche might be profitable to his people
and realme, least myght be layde to his charge the saiyng of Seneca
Es rex &amp; non habes tempus esse rex? Art thou a kyng and hast no tyme
to be a kyng? which is asmuch to say, as art thou a kyng and doest nothyng
profitable to thy people? Art thou a kyng &amp; seest the people haue
an insufficient lawe? Art thou a kyng and wilt not prouide remedy for
the mischiefe of thy people? These thynges haue moued the kynges
highnes to call this his high court of Parliament both for the remedy
of mischiefes whiche be in the comon law, as recoueries, forain vouchers
and corrupt trials. And for making &amp; orderyng of new estatutes
whiche may be to the high auauncement of the common wealth, wherfore
he wylleth he commons to repare to the cōmon house and there to
elect theim a speaker, or their comon mouth, and to certifie the lorde
Chauncellour of the same, whiche should thereof make report to the
kynges moste noble grace, whiche should declare his pleasure when
he would haue him presented before his persone. This was the
cause of the Parlyament he sayd, but surely of these thinges no worde
was spoken in the whole Parlyament, and in effect no good act made

except the graunt of a great subsidie were one, but accordyng to this
instruccion the commons departed to the common house and chose for
their speaker sir Thomas Moore knight &amp; presented him the saterday
after in the Parliament chamber, where he accordyng to the old vsage
disabled himselfe both in wit,The Oracion of sir Thomas More. learnyng, and discrecion, to speake before
the kyng, &amp; brought in for his purpose how one Phormio desired Hanniball
to come to his readyng, whiche thereto assented, and when Hannyball
was come he began to reade, de re militari, that is of Chiualrie,
when Hannyball perceiued him, he called him arrogant foole, because
he would presume to teache him whiche was master of Chiualrie, in the
feates of warre. So the speaker sayd, if he should speake before the
kyng of learnyng and orderyng of a cōmon welth and suche other like
the kyng beyng so well learned &amp; of suche prudence &amp; experience might
say to him as Hannyball sayd to Phormio. Wherfore he desired his
grace that the commons might chose another speaker: The Cardinall
answered, that the kyng knewe his witte, learnyng &amp; discrecion by long
experience in his seruice: wherfore he thought that the commons had
chosen him as the moste metest of all, and so he did admit him. Than sir
Th
                        •
                     mas Moore gaue to the kyng his moste humble thankes, and desired
of him two peticions: The one, if he should de sent from the commons
to the king on message &amp; mistake their entent, that he might with
the kynges pleasure resort againe to the commons for the knowlege of
their true meanyng: The other was, if in communicacion &amp; reasonyng
any man in the cōmon house should speake more largely then of dutie
he ought to do, that all suche offences should be pardoned, &amp; that to be
entred of recorde, whiche two peticions were graunted, and so thus began
the Parlyament and continued as you shal heare.
                  Because an euil chaūce happened to the great rebuke of all christen
princes,The Rhodes besieged. I entend briefly to declare thesame miserable chaunce. In the
beginnyng of this yere Sultan Solyman Pac called ye great Turke
whiche was but the viii. of ye ligne of Ottoman, the fyrst that toke vpō
him to be a great capitain or ruler. And to whom Sultan Selyme his
father had lost thempyres of Constantinoble, Trapesonde, Alexandry,
&amp; Babylon, with many diuers kyngdomes &amp; realmes: whiche Sultan
Solymon the yere before had gotten the toune of Belgrado beyng the
key of Hungary. Because the sawe all ye great princes in Christendome
now at discorde,Why ye turke cou
                           •
                        ted the Rhodes. thought it most for his honor &amp; profite to make warre
on the Isle of ye Rodes and to take thesame, whiche Isle had been kept
by the space of .CC.xiiii. yeres by the brethren or knightes of the order
of sainct Iohnes of Ierusalē. Dyuers thinges moued him to take this
enterprice, One was because this Isle stode so that the religious of the
same oftentymes toke &amp; destroyed his shippes as they came with golde
and other riches from Egypt, Sirie &amp; other Estparties to Constantinoble,
so that by theim of that Isle he sustayned more hurt then by all
Christendome, because the sayd Isle stode in the entry toward Constā
                     tinople.

Another mocion was because his father when he died charged
him to assay to take the Rhodes for to be reuenged of the shame that
they had done to his graundfather Mahomet the great Turke whiche
was with dishonor beten frō the siege of the Rhodes. But the greatest
occasion of all was the exhortacion of a great counsailer of the religiō
called Andrewe Amyral borne in Portyngale, whiche knewe the whole
estate &amp; in what case the toune stode in: The cause why this Andrew Amyral
bare malice to his religion, was because after the death of Frier
Fabrica de Laretto lorde master of their religion, he was not elected to
that honor, but one Philip de Uyllyers de Lisle Adam of Fraunce was
named to be lorde Master, wherfore the sayd Andrew prouoked the
Turke to come to the Rhodes.
                  The great Turke seyng so great an occasiō offered &amp; desiryng honor,
&amp; also knowing the fortresse of y• Rhodes to lacke municions (for surely
the brethren of the sayd order wer both of suche wealth &amp; pride, and also
liued after suche an vngracious &amp; godly fashion, that thei toke neither

so that thei thought ye Turke durst not ones attēpt to set on their garrison,
&amp; so they beyng eleuate in this point of pride, left their toune vnfurnished
and so wer sodainly surprised as you shal heare) wherfore ye
sayd Turke couerty ꝓuided for .iii.C. saile, in y• which he al his caried
artilery &amp; all other thinges necessary: in ye whiche army wer .lx.M. myners
and pyoners prepared for the onely intent to digge &amp; myne: all the
rest of the army of y• Turke came by lād to a place called Fysco, which
stādeth so directly against y• Rhodes that a fyer many be seen frō the one
side to the other, frō whiche place the Turke sent letters to ye abouenamed
Philip de Uylliers lord Master of the sayd religion signifiyng to
him that he would haue y• sayd Isle for y• great damage y• thei had done
to him &amp; his people,The Turke
                           •
                         letter. and if they would yeld to him the sayd Isle, he promised
on his fayth &amp; by Mahomet his fyrst prophet, they should haue
no damage nor hurt by him, &amp; that they that would depart shuld go in
safetie, &amp; they that would tary &amp; serue him should haue good wages, &amp;
if they refused this to do, he sware that he would subuert the walles of
their fortresse and destroy them al and make them slaues, whiche letter
was dated at Constantinople the fyrst day of Iune. The sayd Lorde
Master and his compaignie were greatly abashed of this letter, but
yet like hardy gentlemen they intended to defende them, and made all
the preparacions that thei could do in so short a space, and wrote to all
princes christen of their nede and distres. But the Turke like a wyly
serpent knowyng the great deuision amōgest y• christen princes, so that
he knew that they could sende no succours to the Rhodes, sent CC.M.
Turkes whiche arriued in the Isle of the Rhodes on Mydsomerday,
whiche was y• feastful day of y• Rhodians in honor of S. Ihon baptist

whiche sodain commyng sore abashed the Rhodyans beyng but .vi.C.
knightes and v.M. other mete to beare armes: yet of noble corage and
trusting in God, thei determined to defend the enemies of God, and the
xxviii. day of Iuly the Turke arriued there in his owne person, whiche
muche encoraged his people.
                  When the Turke was arriued, he bent his ordinaunce towarde the
toune and did no great harme, when he saw that the walles were of that
defence that ordinaunce did litle harme, he caused all his Pyoners to
cast yerth one banke ouer another styll till they came within a bowshot
of the wall,The moūtes. and although that many of the pyoners were slain with ordinaunce
of the toune, they neuer ceased tyll they had made a banke of
yearth higher by .x. foote then the wall of the toune, and thei there layde
their ordinaunce, so that no persone durst styrre on the walles or Bulworkes,
and thus with mountaines of yerth was the toune enuironed
and behynd the mountaines lay the Basheaux and chiefe capitaines of
the Turke whiche were euer redy to take their aduauntage, and dayly
they shot into the toune
                        •
                      and bet doune houses and slewe the people in
the streates, for they vpon this mount might easely see into the toune.
Beside this,The Mynes. the Turke caused so many mynes mynes to be made in diuers
places, that they within were not able to make countermynes for lacke
of people, insomuche as wemen were set a worke to dygge and cary, by
reason wherof a great part of the walles were ouerthrowen, and if thei
within had not made countermines the toune had been gotten within
a short space.
                  Also the Turkes in September gaue to the Rhodyans foure great
assautes like valiaunt warriers,The assautes but the Christen men within, so valiantly
defended them, that at euery assaut thei lost at the lest .ii.M. men,
and at the fourth assaut they lost .x.M. Turkes and more.
                  The great Turke seyng the losse of his men at the assautes, sent for
Mo
                        •
                     staffa Basshaw, through whose counsail he toke on him this enterprice
and muche blamed him that he had made him beleue that he
might haue the toune within .xii. dayes or in a moneth at ye most wherfore
in y• furie he would hue put him to death, if the other Bass
                        •
                     awes
had not entreated for him: but in cōclusion ye Turke determined clerely
to rayse his siege and to depart, and so had done if that same night sir
Andrew Amyrall that you heard of before and a Iewe beyng within
the Rhodes had not written letters and shot them out on quarelles into
the Turkes army. By whiche letters the Turke knew the necessitie
of the toune and feblenes of the people, whiche caused him to chaunge
his purpose.Treason espyed. But this treason was espyed, and the traytors taken and
put to terrible execucion, And the Turke caused so many Mynes to be
made, that although some tooke none effecte, yet by some he ouerthrew
bothe Bulwarkes, walles and towers, so that he might entre into the
toune: and so on sainct Andrewes euen he caused a great assaut to be
geuen, whiche was very fierce, but yet the Christen men so valiauntly

defended them, that thei slewe three thousand Turkes and mo, and kept
them from enteryng that daie, but the Citezens of the Rhodes after this
assaulte, came to the lorde Master, and praied hym to haue compassion
of them, their wiues and children, and shewed hym that if the toune wer
taken by assault, (as it was like to be) that thei al should be cruelly murdered,
the Lorde Master muche regarded his honor, and comforted the
people with faire wordes, but by chaunce about thesame tyme, the great
Turke sent a letter into the Rhodes, willyng theim to deliuer the toune,
and thei all should haue their liues and goodes, and thei that would tary,
should tary in quiet, &amp; thei that would departe, should sauely depart.
                  When this letter was knowen, then the people cried out on the lorde
Master, to take the offre, wherfore he callyng all his counsaill together
seyng that it was not possible to kepe the toune longe, both for lacke of
artilary and vitaile, and also because his nomber was so minished, that
scace he had souldiers to kepe the walles: wherefore he by greate aduice
determined to take the Turkes offer, and so sent to hym twoo of his religion,
for the farther conclusion and assuraunce of thesame,The yeldyng vp of the Rhodes. whiche
well entertained them, and had writynges sealed of al thynges that thei
desired, to whiche twoo knightes. Aymeche Bassaw sware by his faith
that there was slain at the siege .lxiiii. thousande Turkes, and .xl. thousande
dedde of mortalitie and mo.
                  And so on Christmas daie, the greate Turke hymself entered into the
Rhodes, and toke possession therof, and the lorde Master and all his religion,
the first daie of Ianuary tooke ship and sailed to Candy, and s
                        •
                     
in conclusion came to Rome, and there declared his chaunce and aduenture.
Thus was the toune and the isle of the Rhodes, taken by the great
Turke, whiche was a greate succor to all Christian men, resortyng into
the Este partes of the world, whiche chaunce was muche lamented thorowe
all Christendom, and muche blame put in all Princes, because thei
sent no succor nor aide to the Isle.
                  And this yere the bishoppe of Duresme died, and the kyng gaue the
bishoprike to the Cardinall, and he resigned the bishoprike of Bathe, to
doctor Ihon Clerke master of the Rolles, and he made sir Henry Marney
his vicechamberleyn lorde Priuie Seale, &amp; after created hym lorde
Marney. In thende of this yere, doctor Blithe bishopp of Chester, was
attached for treason, but he acquite hymself. And aboute this season, the
Cardinall of Yorke beyng Legate, proued testamentes, and did call before
hym, all the executors and administrators, of euery Dioces within
the realme, so that the bishoppes and ordinaries, did proue no great willes
in their Dioces, except he wer compounded with, not to their litle disauauntage.
Also by his power Legantine he gaue by prouencions, all
benefices belongyng to spirituall persones, by the whiche doyng, he not
onely had the hatred of the spiritualtie, but also he ran into the daunger
of the Premunire, whiche he sore after repented, as it shall appere in the
xxi. yere of this kyng.

aswell of the Spiritualtie, as of the temporaltie, came the
xxix. daie of Aprill into the Common house, where he cloquently
declared to the commons, how the Frenche Kyng
Fraunces the first, called the moste Christened kyng, had so often tymes
broken promise with the kyng of England, and his welbeloued nephew
Charles the Emperor, that the kyng of his honor, could not lōger suffre.
For first he declared, that the metyng of thesaied twoo princes at Guysnes,
thesaid Frenche kyng was sworne, to kepe al the articles conteined
in the tripartie league, made betwene hym, the Emperour, and the kyng
of Englande, sithe the whiche tyme, he hath made warre on themperors
dominiōs by Robert de la Marche his capitain. He also hath with holden
the tributes and other paimentes, whiche he should paie to the kyng
of Englande, for redempcion of Tornay and Tirwin, and not with this
content, hath not alonely robbed and spoyled the kynges subiectes, but
also hath sent Ihon duke of Albany into Scotlande, to make warr and
to inuade this realme, wherefore the Kyng of necessitie was driuen to
warre and defence, whiche in no wise could be mainteined, without great
somes of money,The dema

the fifth parte of euery mannes goodes and landes, that is to saie .iiii.s.
of euery pounde, for he saied that the yere folowyng, the Kyng and the
Emperor should make suche warre in Fraunce, as hath not been seen.
               After that he had declared his matter at length, exhortyng the Commons
to aide their prince, in tyme of necessitie, he departed out of the cō
                  mon
house. The morowe after, sir Thomas More beyng speker, declared
all the Cardinalles oracion again to the commons, and enforced his
demaund strongly, saiyng: that of duetie men ought not to deny to paie
iiii.
                     •
                  . of the pounde. But for all that, it was denied and proued manifestly,
that if the fifth parte of substaunce of the Realme, were but .viii.C.

                  . and if men should paie to the kyng, the fifth parte of their goodes,
in money or plate, it was proued, that there was not so muche money out
of the kynges handes, in all the realme, for the fifth parte of euery mannes
goodes, is not in money nor plate: For although fiue men wer well
monyed, fiue thousand wer not so, the gentleman of landes, hath not the
fifth parte of the value in coyne: the Merchaunt that is riche of Silke,
Wolle, Tynne, Clothe, and suche Merchaundise, hath not the fifth part
in money, the husbande man is riche in Corne and cattell, yet he lacketh
of that some. Likewise viteilers and all other artificers, be riche in housholde
stuffe, and not in money: and then consequently, if all the moeny
wer brought to the kynges handes, then men must barter clothe for vitaile,
and bread for chefe, and so one thyng for another: then cōsider that
after this valuacion, the kyng hath had by the waie of loane .ii.

whiche is almoste the third part of euery mannes good, whiche in coyne
cannot bee had within this Realme, for the profe whereof was alleged,
that if there were in Englande, but .xv.M. parishes, and euery parishe
should geue a .C. marke, that were but .xv.C.M. marke, whiche is but
x.C.M.
                     •
                  . and how many parishes be in Englande on with another able
to spare a .C. markes, out of citees and tounes: and where it is written,
that in Englande there bee .xl. M. Parishe Churches, it was proued
that there wer not .xiii. M. parishe churches at this vaie. Then accompt
the whole some cannot amounte aboue .x.C.M.

pounde, therefore it was thought, the some was impossible to be leuied,
and if all the coyne wer in the kynges handes, how should men liue: Also
the kyng had of the spirituall men the last yere, iiii.s. of the pounde.
               After long reasonyng, there wer certain appoynted, to declare the impossibilite
of this demaunde to the Cardinal, whiche accordyng to their
commission, declared to hym substancially the pouertie and skarcenes
of the realme: all whiche reasons and demonstracions, he litle regarded,
and then thesaid persones, moste m
                     •
                  kely beseched his grace, to moue the
kynges highnes, to bee content with a more easier some, to the whiche he
currishly answered, that he would rather haue his tongue, plucked out
of his hedde with a paire of pinsons, then to moue the kyng, to take any
lesse some: with whiche answere, thei almoste dismaied, came and made
reporte to the common house, where euery daie was reasonyng, but nothyng
concluded.
               Wherefore the Cardinall came again to the common house, and desired
to be reasoned withall, to whom it was answered, that the fashion of
the nether house was, to heare and not to reason, but emong themselfes.
Then he shewed the realme to be of greate riches, firste, because the kynges
customes were greater now, then thei were before tyme: also he alleged
sumpteous buildynges, plate, riche apparell, of menne, women, children,
and seruauntes, fatte feastes, and dilicate dishes, whiche thynges
were all tokens of greate aboundance: with whiche repetyng of mennes
substaunce, as though he had repined or disdained, that any man should
fare well, or be well clothed, but hymself, the commons greatly grudged.
And when he was departed out of the house, it was proued, that honest
apparell of the commodities of this Realme, aboundance of plate, and
honest viandes, were profitable to the realme, and not prodigall.
               After long debatyng, the Commons concluded to graunte .ii.s. of the
pound, of euery mannes landes or goodes, that was worth .xx. pounde,
or might dispende .xx. pounde, to be taken for the kyng, and so vpwarde
of euery .xx.s. twoo .s. and from .xl.s. to .xx. pounde, of euery .xx.s.xii.d.
and vnder .xl.s. of euery hed, xvi. yeres and vpward .iiii.d. to bee paied
in two yeres. This graunt was reported to the Cardinall, whiche therwith
was sore discontent, and saied, that the lordes had graunted .iii.s.

of the pound, whiche was proued vntrue, for in dede thei had graunted
nothyng, but harkened all vpon the commons.
               Then a knight called sir Ihon Huse of Lincolneshire, saied, to please
the Cardinal somewhat, let vs gentlemen of fiftie pound lande and vpwardes,
geue to the kyng of our landes .xii.d. of the pounde, to be paied
in thre yere: with whiche mocion diuerse gentlemen wer sore discontent.
And when the question was asked, ten or .xii. of the gentlemen saied yea,
and when the naie should be asked, the commons saied nothyng, for thei
would not condempne, nor let the gētlemen to charge themselfes, and so
by .x. or .xii. persones the gentlemen wer burdened, with .xii.d. more then
other, for the whiche graunt, sir Ihon Huse and muche euill will.
               A

                  ter this graunte made the .xxi. daie of Maie, because of Whitsontide
the Parliament was proroged to the tenth daie of Iune: Duryng
whiche prorogacion, the common people saied to the Burgesses, sirs, we
heare saie you will graunt .iiii.s. of the pound, we aduise you to doo so
that you maie go home, with many euill woordes and threatenynges.
               And in this season, the Cardinall by his power legātine, dissolued the
Conuocacion at Paules, called by the Archebishop of Cantorbury, and
called hym and all the clergie, to his conuocaciō to Westminster, which
was neuer seen before in Englande, wherof master Skeltō a mery Poet
wrote. Gentle Paule laie doune thy sweard: For Peter of westminster hath shauen thy beard.
               
               When the parliament was begonne again, the landed menne of fiftie
pounde and vpward, seyng that thei were charged, with .xii.d. of euery
pounde of their landes, moued, that all suche as were worth fiftie poūde
in goodes and vpward, should paie also .xii.d. of the pounde, in the .iiii.
yere. At the whiche mocion was muche reasonyng, &amp; at the last the .xxvii.
daie of Iune, the question was asked, and doubtfull it was, whether the
yea or nay were moste, then was the house diuided, and al the commons
seuered theimselfes, from the knightes of the sheres, so that one yea part
remained onely the knightes of the shire, and the cōmons stifly affirmed
that the mocioners of this demaunde, wer enemies to the realme. At the
last the Speaker called theim all together, and after long perswadyng,
and priuie laboryng of frendes, it was agreed that .xii.d. of the pounde
should be paied the fourth yere, of fiftie pounde in goodes.
               After this the parliamēt the ▪xxxi. daie of Iuly, was adiorned to Westminster,
and there continued till the .xiii. daie of August, and that daie at

sonne to kyng Edward the fourth, at Bridewell created viscount Lisle,
in the right of his wife, whiche was wife to Edmond Dudley behedded.
               In this season was true worde brought, that on Christmas daie laste
past, the strong toune of the Rhodes was deliuered, to the great Turke
called Sultan Soliman, with the whole Islande, to the greate hurt of

he made muche suite to come into Englande, to see and speake with the
kyng, whiche request was to hym graunted, and so he and his Quene,

Court, he was conueighed to Londō, and lodged at Bathe place, where
he hearyng of the watche in London, on sainct Peters euen, desired to se

whiche thynges set in a perfectnes, thei returned toward the kyng, and
came to the ende of the Parliament.
               In this season,A ship sonken with stone in 
                        •
                     alice hauen▪
                   the Frenchemen hauyng a greate desire, to haue the
kynges toune of Calice, deuised first to destroy the hauen, by the which
thei supposed, that Calice might haue been lightly gotten, for faulte of
reskewe. Whereupon thei laded an old ship of .iiii.C. tonne, with great
Cane stone, in the port of Depe, whiche ship had no mast, but came with
a forsaile, as though the mast had been cut, and cast ouer the bord in the
sea in a tempest. And when she came before Calice, euery man that sawe
her, thought she had been wether driuen, and lost her mast by tēpest, and
so aboute .x. of the clocke at night the .xxiiii. daie of Maie, thesaid shippe
came before Calice hauē, as though she would entre for harborow, and
so was enteryng and missed the chanell, &amp; turned to the sandes, towarde
Rise banke, and the Frēchemen supposyng, that thei had been in the very
chanell, launched out their boate, and sodainly set the shippe on fire,
and lepte into their boate, and so skaped by the shore. When thei of Calice
sawe the fire, thei were sore troubled, and at the last when the water
was gone, thei perceiued the ship consumed, and the goodly Cane stone
liyng whole.
               Wherfore the lorde Barnes deputie of Calice, the lorde Barkley leuetenaunt
of the castle, the lorde Sandes thresorer of Calice, and other
commaunded all the laborers that might be gotten, to breake the remnaunt
of the ship, and to cary awaie the stone, and so thesaied stone was
brought to Calice: wherupon thesaied capitaines sent a letter, to the capitain
of Bull
                     •
                  ine, by Calice pursiuant at armes, desiryng hym to geue
thankes, to Monsire Lodowyke capitain of Depe, for the sendyng of
for faire a ship, and goodly stone to Calice, whiche stone thesaied lordes
sent worde, thei had receiued into the toune of Calice, and that it did thē
muche profite, for the fortificacion of thesaied Toune, desiryng hym to
sende more, and thei would receiue it on thesame price. To the whiche
letter, the capitain of Bulleine answered, I haue nothyng lost, nor thei
haue nothyng gotten of me, tell hym that hath lost, with whiche answere
the pursiuant departed. Wherupon thenglishemen beyng greued, there
issued out of Calice an .C. light menne of warre, called auenturers, and
came nere Bulleine, and obteined a greate botie, wherof the garrison of
Bullein beyng aduertised, issued out and folowed the Englishmen, and
sharpely them encountered. The Englishemen shot so, that the Frenche
men whiche were fiue hundred, lighted and fought sore, so that as it appered
euidently, that there wer dedde on the ground .xlvi. Frenchemen,

and .xxii. Englishemen, and the Frenchemen toke .xx. Englishemen prisoners,
the residue of the Englishemen kept them to gether, and so came
to Calice, the capitain of this enterprise was on Lathebery.
               The lorde Sandes thresorer of Calice, entendyng to be reuenged on
the Frenchemen, called the counsaill of Calice to hym, and declared to
them how that the Frenchemen, and in especiall Monsire de Bees capitain
of Bullein, daily imagened to destroye the Englishe pale, and that
thei on the Englishe part, had nothyng doen yet against them: wherfore
he aduised them all to do some act, and he hymself would be present, and
formoste man, and their leder and capitain. Whereupon it was concluded
and commaunded, that euery manne should be in a readines, at the
foundyng of a trompet, vpon whiche warnyng, thesaied lorde Sandes
the .ix daie of Iuly early in the mornyng, sent furth twoo hundred light
horses, through the Englishe pale, to stoppe the people from goyng, the
one towarde the other, least his enterprise should bee askried, and so the
people wer kept in all that daie, and in the euenyng aboute seuen of the
clocke, he himself with a capitain called Guiot, Thomas Palmer, Ripton.
Raufe Broke and other, set forward with light ordinaunce and vitaile,
and embattailed themselfes in good arraie, and marched towarde
Sandifelde by a .xi. of the clocke, and there refreshed themselfes, and in
good ordre, thei came to the Water of Sclaukes, not farre from Bullein,
whiche was the tenth daie of Iuly.
               When thei were askried Alarme was rong all the countrey, and the
capitain of Bullein sent furth .lxx. menne of Armes, and foure hundred
footemen with morice pikes, crosebowes, and hande gunnes, wherefore
capitain Guyot was sent with his bend of horsemen, to aide thenglishe
footemen, whiche were farre behynde, and Capitain Ripton, was appoynted
to fight with the Frenchemen, and sir Thomas Palmer, and
Raufe Broke, with the remnaūt of the horsemen, stode for a stale. Then
capitain Ripton profered forwarde with the Speres of Calice, and the
Frenchmen came on valiauntly, then began a sore skirmishe, the Frēchemen
bothe horsemen and footemen, defended the passage at the water of
Sclaukes, whiche is but a gut made by force of lande water, but after
long fight, the Englishemen gat ouer the water by pure force, and toke
the Frenchemens standerd, and a gentleman, whiche was a man of Armes
of Bullein, called Charles be Maruiel, and euer sir Thomas Palmer
and Raufe Broke, stode &amp; aided where necessitie was moste. Thus
this skirmishe continued, from foure of the Clocke in the mornyng, till
ix. of the clocke, before None, and euer the Frenchemen encreased, but at
the last thei retreited themselfes toward Bullein, in whiche returne diuerse
of thē wer slain. Or the skirmishe was ended, came the lorde Sandes
with the fotemen, with his spere on his thigh, and this helme on his
hed, and greatly encoraged his compaignie: duryng whiche conflict, diuerse
of Picardy had gathered them together, and had taken the church
of Odirsaell, whiche was well fortefied, and a strong place: whereof the

Lorde Sandes beyng aduertised, he marched thether ward, and in the
waie burned all that might be brent, and sent an officer of Armes, to thē
that kept the churche of Odirsaell, to yeld the churche to hym; whiche to
hym answered▪ that thei would stande at defence: then he commaunded
an assault, whiche quickly was doen, and the Frenchemen defended thē
selfes, with hand gonnes, crosebowes, and pikes, so that the Englishmē
could not entre. Then the lorde Sandes commaunded a curtal, whiche
he had with hym, to be shotte to the churche, and perced it through: then
thei within sawe that their defence could not hold, yelded thēselfes be by
and goodes. Out of the Churche came .lxxii. Frenchemen, whiche were
taken as prisoners, and all the goodes whiche thei had caried into the
churche were taken for a botie. Thus by one of the cl
                     •
                  cke, thesaid tenth
daie of Iuly, was the churche of Odirsaell taken.
               In this while also, had the Frenchemen manned the steple of Odyngham,
whiche was a very strong tower, muche like a castle, to whom the
lorde Sandes sent an officer of armes, to commaunde them to yelde the
fortresse, to whom thei answered, that thei wer Frenchemen, and to hym
thei would none yeld, and if he came thether, thei would withstand him:
wherupon he and his armie marched thether ward, and aboute foure of
the clocke at after none, he assaulted the steple, and the Frenchmen them
selfes valiauntly defended, but sodainly by a chaūce vnknowen, the s
                     •
                  eple
was a sire, and the Frenchemen fled doune to the quire, then the Englishemen
lightly entered the body of the churche, &amp; assaulted the Frēch
menne, whiche cried mercie and yelded theimselfes, and at twelue of the
Clocke at midnight the assaulte ended, and there were yelded out of the
churche fortie prisoners.
               After whiche tyme, the Lorde Sandes encamped hymself, and made
good watche for feare of enemies, &amp; in the mornyng called to hym all the
priestes, whiche wer in bothe the churches, and stode at defence, and said
to thē, that thei ought not to bee men of warre, and notwithstandyng he
had theim as prisoners, yet for Gods sake he released thē, admonishyng
thē, that if euer after thei wer taken at defence, thei should be hanged on
the nexte galowes: after whiche monicion doen, he deliuered them frely.
               About .viii. of the clocke in the mornyng, he marched forward in good
ordre of battaill, and came to the Castle of Hardyngham, the whiche he
brent and spoyled, and so the .xi. daie of Iuly, he and his cōpaignie whiche
passed not .xii.C. men, of whiche he had lost but onely .xii. returned to
Calice with greate store of bestiall and pillage.
               This▪ same season, the Frenche kyng sent an armie of .xviii.M. men,
towardes the parties of Flaunders, whiche secretly enterprised to take
a place called Newdike, whiche is a strong passage, betwene Fraunce
and Flaunders, kept by the Flemynges, whereof thei beyng aduertised,
a

                  eised a greate power of .xiii.M. and came to the passage, and slewe of
the Frenchemen .vi.C: then the Frenchemen reculed, and seuered theimselfes:
some went to Mount Orry, and some to sainct Omers and some

brent the subbarbes, thei within Mount Orry defended themselfes, and
hurte the capitain of Bulleine, called Monsire de Bees, and slewe his
horse: wherfore the Frenchemen wente thence, and brent a village called
Arkus: thus was all the 
                     •
                  rountiers full of Frenchemen, in somuche that
in the monethe of August, thei bette into the toune of Guisnes, the scourers
and the scoute watche, whereof began Alarme, and the Frenchmen
whiche were many in nōbre, a lighted as though thei would geue assaut
maintenant, and fiersly proffered toward the diches, but when the ordinaunce
beganne once to shote, it was no nede to bid theim go. Then the
Englishemen coragiously folowed the chace, but sodainly out came an
embushement of Frenchemen, and toke twoo Englishemen, and thus al
the armie of Fraunce, remoued to Gyngate beside Tyrwyn.
               The Frenche kyng seyng the kyng of England, daily more and more
encoraged to make war on hym and his dominions, and that the Scottes
did nothyng to his pleasure, for lacke of the Duke Ihon of Albany,
whom the Scottes called their gouernor. He therfore caused greate preparaciō
to be made, on all parties for men, shippes, harnes, and artilery
for the sendyng of the Duke Ihon of Albany into Scotlande, whiche
Duke of a greate presumpcion promised to the Frenche kyng, to driue
the kyng of Englande out of his realme, whiche promise was not kept.
               The Kyng of Englande, hearyng that the Duke of Albany, should
passe into Englande, to make warre on his realme, thought to haue him
met on the seas, and therfore he prepared, a flete of tal and strōg shippes
mete to encounter with thesaied Duke and his power, and made Admirall
of that iorney, sir Willyam Fitz willyam, and with hym sir Fraunces
Brian, sir Antony Pounez, Seriant Rot, Ihon Hopton, Willyam
Goustone, Anthony Kniuet, Thomas West &amp; other whiche with great
diligence, laie in waite to mete with thesaid duke of Albany, and as thei
sailed on the Frenche coste, thei determined to lande, to doo some harme
to Tray Port, and as thei houered there, thei were espied: then the capitain
of the toune fired the beakēs, sent for aide of al the for

                  resses about
and strengthed and manned the toune very warlike. This notwithstandyng,
sir William Fitz William and other capitaines, left not their enterprice,
and so the .xxiii. daie of August beyng Sondaie, at seuen of the
clocke in the mornyng, thei toke lande in the hauen of Treyport, at whō
the Frenchemen shot out ordinaunce, quarelles and stones, the English
men in the botes shot likewise, and encoraged by their capitaines, assauted
the Frenchemen in their bulwerkes, the Frenchemen them valiantly
defended, and thenglishe capitaines as men without fere, theim assailed
and yet the nomber was nothyng egall, for the Englishemen were but
vii.C. men, &amp; the Frenchmen .vi.M. For the well fightyng of the Frēch
men, their bulwerkes wer taken, and their ordinaunce sezed, and all that
wer about, fled to the toune of Treiport, and euer thenglishmen folowed

wherefore thei set fire on theim, and brent there seuen faire shippes bestoe

succors failed them, wherefore of necessitie thei muste deliuer the castle,
whereto thei agreed, and so he yelded the castle, his life onely saued, and
all other at the mercie of the duke, whiche pardoned theim, and toke thē
as prisoners, and deliuered the castle to sir Willyam Skeuyngtō, whiche
was shortly rased doune to the ground, the .xxvii. daie of Septēber.
               Mondaie beyng the .xxviii. daie of Septēber, there was a proclamacion
made in tharmy, how that Fraunces duke of Burbon, &amp; Constable
of Fraunce, was become frend to the kyng of Englande, &amp; enemy to the
Frēch kyng▪ &amp; was sworne to the kyng of England, &amp; had in his wages
for the kyng of England .x.M. Almaines to inuade Fraūce, or to let the
French kynges purposes, &amp; for this intent to hym was sent money in no
litle some, but the common people said, y• neuer was Frenchman true to
Englande, how be it he was true as long as he liued.
               
                  
To make this proclamacion more apparant, you must vnderstande
that in this season the Frenche king was ruled by his mother the Coū
                  tesse
of Angulesme and the Admyrall of Fraunce called lorde Bonyu
                     •
                  t
whiche as was reported and sayd, loued the sayd lady as his paramor,
of whiche all the court of Fraunce spake muche. These two persones
so ruled the kyng, that what thei sayd was done, and no iudgement nor
sētence passed in the Parliament at Parys without their assent, so that
nothing was done without them, at whiche thing the nobles of Fraūce
sore disdained and especially the lorde Fraunces duke of Burbon and
Constable of Fraunce whiche hauing a suite for therledome of Montpelyer
could not be heard speake nor his counsail neither. At the l
                     •
                  st
he beyng sore displeased with this vnkynd and vniust handlyng, came
to the French kyng besechyng him of iustice &amp; fauor, whiche flateryng
him sayd, that al that was in his power to do he would gladly accomplish,
&amp; other answer had he none, &amp; to encreace his grudge ye more, the
Frenche kinges mother made a title to the whole Duchy of Burbon &amp;
Auerne, and the Admyral &amp; she so entised the kyng that he sayd opēly
that the Duke of Burbon shortly should be as poore as the meanest
gentleman in Fraunce, whiche wordes reported to him caused him to
hate mortally the Frenche kyng and his mother, and so in displeasure
departed into his owne countrey. The kyng of England beyng he
                     •
                  eof
aduertised, sent to the duke of Burbon a knight of his Chamber called
sir Ihon Russell a man well languaged, whiche wisely and couertly so
behaued himself, that he came to the duke to Molyns and knew al his
entent how he would forsake his kyng, and serue the king of Englād &amp;
the Emperor against the Frenche kyng, and therevpon tooke his othe
                     •
                  
The Frenche kyng not mistrusting the allegeance of the duke of Burbon
sent to the Duke to prepare him to go into Italye, for he had prepared
a great army to passe the mountaines against the duke of Myllaine,
in which army he had .vi.M. men of armes, and .xxv.M. fotemen
The duke hearyng hereof fained himselfe sicke, and the Frenche kyng
passyng by Molyns visited &amp; cōforted him: to whō the duke promised
to come shortly after to Lyons with all his power, and caused an horselitter
to be caried emptie, iii. dayes amongest a certain of his souldiers
as though he were 
                     •
                  here, but he himselfe fled secretly into the Countye
of Burgoyne pertainyng to the Emperor, where he retained .x.M. Almaines
to inuade Fraunce assone as the Frenche kyng was passed the
mountaines.
               When the Frenche kyng heard of this, he sent the Admyrall into Italy
with his army, &amp; sent his great Master to seaze al the dukes lādes.
Of all these doynges sir Ihon Russell brought true worde, for he was
present with the Duke, and also sawe the Frenche armye, and returned
vnespied, wherfore he deserued &amp; had of the king and his coūsail great
thankes. Wherevpon the kyng caused the proclamacion to be made in
the army, that they might knowe that all the power of Fraunce should

not trouble them. For what with the warres of Italy and for the duke
of Burbons power they might do what they lust &amp; be vnfought withal
whiche so proued after. Whiche tidynges muche encoraged thenglishe
souldiers.
               After this proclacion, there were tidynges brought to the army for a
trueth, that one Hierome Uicount, a great familiar frende wt the duke
of Myllayne entised by the Frenche kyng, had almost slaine Fraūces
duke of Myllaine with a dagger behynd at his backe, with the whiche
doyng the Frenche kyng aboue all persones fained himselfe to be most
displeased. The morowe beyng the .xxix. day of September the duke
with his whole army remoued to Arde and there lodged, &amp; the last day
of September he remoued to a village called Alrke, and from thence
the fyrst day October he came to a village betwene Tyrwyn and saint
Omers called Esqwerdes or Cordes, where the duke lay and encāped
himselfe abidyng his enemies.
               Nowe must I returne to tell you what was done betwene England
and Scotland this same season. Whyle the Duke of Suffolke was
thus inuadyng the realme of Fraūce. The Scottes thinkyng the war
turned into Fraunce, and that nothyng should be attempted against
them, began to robbe and spoile on the Marches of England, whereof
the kyng hearyng sent againe thither the valiant erle of Surray treasorer
and Admyrall of England, whiche in all hast sped him to the west
Marches and sent for an army of vi.M. men, &amp; with banner displayed
entred by the dry Marches betyng doune castles &amp; fortresses on euery
side. And alth
                     •
                  ugh the Scottes be men of high corage, yet they seyng
the wise conduict of the noble erle of Surray and his chosen company,
durst not ones enco
                     •
                  
                  ̄ter with hi
                     •
                  , and so he passed quietly through the
dales, tyll he came to the strong toune of Iedworthe, in whiche lay a
great garrison of Scottishmen whiche did al the hurt they could to the
Englishmen, and hardely in great nomber skyrmished with thenglishmen,
so that on both partes diuers wer slaine, but in the end the Abbay,
Castle, and toune of Iedworth were brent and all rased a sonder in the
open sight of the Scottes. And after this he would not returne but encamped
himself in the Scottishe ground abidyng battail, and lay ther
from the .xxii. day of September to the .xxv. day. D
                     •
                  ryng whiche tyme
tyme he sent y• lorde Daker of Gyldersland to a strong hold of Doncar
called Fernhurst, the whiche castle stode very euil to come to, for the
wayes wer hylly, stony, and full of marishes, and the Scottes had bent
their ordinaunce that way: yet for all that the Englishmen so fiersly set
on that they gat the castle, notwithstandyng that the Scottes fought
valiauntly, and many of theim were taken, as Dan Car the lorde, the
lorde of Gradon and diuers other whiche was there taken, and so the
lorde Daker returned with his prisoners, and then he was ordained to
kepe the watche that night whiche set his watches &amp; his wardes surely.
In the night sodainly .CCC. good geldynges brake out of a pasture,

whiche were in custodie of the sayd lord Dacres campe, and as beastes
wodde and sauage ranne enraged, and notwithstandyng that men did
asmuche as they might to stoppe them, yet they ranne as though they
were in array of battail, whereof the noyse in the night was so great,
that the armye souned alar me, the horse styll in array ranne to the cāpe,
where the erle lay and bare doune many persones in their waye, and so
sodainly ranne away whether it was vnknowen: the lorde Dacres men
sayd that the deuil was sene amongest them: and after the third day the
Erle returned into England,
               When the Erle of Surray departed from the borders in August as
you haue heard heretofore: The Scottes wrote to the duke of Albany
of all their affaires, whiche was commyng into Scotland. But when
he heard that the Nauy of England lay in wayte to fight with him, he
durst not auenture, but sate styll: And when he heard there was no capitaines
of name on the borders of England toward Scotland, he deuised
by policie that all his shippes should be remoued to the hauen of
Brest, and sayd himselfe and caused it to be noysed that he would not
saile into Scotlād that yere. So rāne the voice al the coastes of Normandy
and Britaigne, and so passed tyll the ende of Septembre.
               The kyng of England was enformed by suche as knew none other,
that the Duke of Albany had broken his iorney, and would not passe
that yere into Scotland. Wherfore the kyng of England in the middest
of September caused his shippes to be layde vp in hauens tyl the
next spryng: The duke of Albany beyng therof aduertised boldly then
tooke his shippes and shipped his people, and with .lxxii. saile in sight
passed by the West partes of England and coasted Wales, &amp; so with
great labor landed at Kyrcowbre in the West parte of Scotland with
all his people the .xxi. day of Septēber whiche were in nomber .iii.M.
or there about, and with him was the traytor Richard Delapole.
               When it was knowen in Scotland that the lorde Gouernor was
landed, muche gladnes there was amongest the people. Then the duke
was highly receiued and his people wel cherished, and then beganne a
Parlyament. The kyng of England hearyng that the duke of Albany
was landed in Scotlande and was vnfought withall, was not a litle
displeased, and suspected that suche as enformed him that the Duke
would not passe that yere, had deceiued him, but there was no remedye:
Wherfore he made prouisions and put all thynges in a readynes, if he
would attempt any thing against him and his realme.
               The Duke of Albany Gouernor of Scotland beyng in the Parliament
of the realme, with great eloquence declared to them the loue and
fauor that Fraūces the Frenche kyng bare to the realme of Scotland,
insomuch that he beyng aduertised of the great murders, slaughters, &amp;
burnynges done by the Englishemen, thought that he suffered no lesse
hurt and damage then they did, accomptyng him self one of their membres,
and them likewise the membres of him and his realme, and for the
reuenging of thesame, he to be partener as their member, &amp; for the more

credite he shewed the Frenche kynges fauorable letter, affirmyng his
d
                     ••
                  laracion. When the letters wer red, there start vp a Baron of Scotland
called the lorde Forbos, whiche sayd: the realme of Scotland for
the loue of Fraunce suffereth great paine as daily doeth appere, for our
nobles be slain or taken, our cominaltie murdered, our lādes ouerrūne,
our houses &amp; fortresses brent &amp; rased, the profites of our owne lādes we
lese: which mischief we nede not to haue had, but for the loue of Fraūce,
&amp; what helpeth Fraunce? A farre frend is not sone fet? A mightie nieghbor
may be a cruel enemy. I affirme this, if we would kepe amitie with
the realme of England we were out of all these daungers. God forbyd
sayd the duke of Albany that Scotland euer should seke a new frende
or pro
                     •
                  er their amitie, to the destroyers of their coūtrey and nacion, but
you my lordes of Scotlād are sufficient of your selfe to maintain your
lādes, libertie, &amp; fredome against your comon enemies thenglishemen.
And therfore now let vs together reuenge the hurtes done to vs &amp; our
countrey: And I on myne honor shal go with you, and therfore I haue
brought with me bothe treasure, men, and artillerie into this realme. I
thinke not but we shall so do that all Christendome shall speake of our
noble cōquest. To the dukes request all ye court of Parliament agreed
and then wer cōmissions sent through Scotland &amp; cryes made that all
men shuld assemble at Doglas dale with vitaile for xxviii. dayes. The
Scotes in al hast prepared, so that the lordes wer come to the place appointed
the xviii. day of October, with vitaile, gunnes, &amp; all other artillerie,
and so came by easy iorneys to the riuer of Twede on a ground
beside Hume castle, &amp; frō thence came to Cawdestrene &amp; there lodged.
               All this doyng the kyng of England knewe well, wherfore with all
diligēce he caused to be assembled the people of the North part beyond
Trent, whero
                     •
                   there were .iii.M. beryng cotes of armes wt their power
and strength, whiche al wer cōmaunded to resort to the erle of Surray
with spede. The noble Marques Dorset Thomas was appointed to
kepe Berwicke with vi.M. men, lest ye Scottes therto would lay siege.
               The duke of Albany whiche lay on the frontiers hearyng of the Erle
of Surreyes preparyng▪ sent to him an Herauld promisyng him of his
honor to geue him battail, and if he tooke him in battail he would put
him to curteous raunsome &amp; his body to be safe: To whom the erle answered,
that muche he thanked the duke of his offer, and that he would
abide battail, 
                     •
                  msyng him that he would geue him battail if he durst
abide: and if that ye sayd duke were taken prisoner by him or his menne
he would strike of his head &amp; send it to the kyng of England his Master,
and bad that he should trust to none other, at whiche answere the
duke of Albany and the Scottes toke great dispite.
               The erle of Surray beyng at Alnwyke, to him came therles of Northumberland
and Westmerland, the lorde Clyfford, the lorde Dacres,
the lorde Lumley, the lorde Ogle, the lorde Darcy, and many noble
Knightes▪ Squiers and yomen, to the nomber of .xl.M. And from the
kynges court was sent to be at the batail sir Nicholas Carew Master

of the horse, sir Fraunces Bryan, sir Edwarde Baynton and diuers other.
All this armye laye on the borders abidyng the Scottes cōmyng
into Englande, whiche lay styll in Scotland and did nothyng till the
last day of October beyng Saterday. The night before the Scottes
had sent ouer the water into England .iii. or .iiii.M. men, to lay siege to
a lytle castle called ye Castle of Warke, whiche stādeth nere the border:
the great ordinaūce of Scotland sore bet the castle, and Dan Car and
the Frenchemen whiche came out of Fraunce with the duke of Albany
gaue to the castle a strong assaut: within the castle was sir Williā Lyle
with a C. persones, but the Scottes were so many in nomber, that they
got the vttermoste warde called the Barnkyns where the beastes and
barnes were, whiche seyng, the capitaine sent in all hast to the Erle of
Surrey aduertisyng him of their distres, whiche in all hast assembled
his capitaines to reskue the castle, therby hopyng that Duke Ihon of
Albany would enter into England. The Frenchmen and Scottes lay
styll about the castle cōtinually shotyng ordinaunce Sonday &amp; Monday
the fyrst and second day of Nouember, and then the Scottes thinkyng
the place assautable, coragiously set on the castle and by strength
entred the second warde. Sir Willyā Lyle perceiuyng that ye Scottes
had gotten the false brayes and that nothing remained but only the inner
warde or dōgeon, sayd to his company, sirs for our honor &amp; māhod
let vs issue and fight with the proude Scottes and stately Frenchmen,
for more shall our honor be to dye in fight, then to be murthered with
gunnes, to the whiche his company that were left agreed: for of his .C.
men he had lost almost .xl. at the other assautes. Then they issued out
boldly and shot coragiously as men that shot for a vauntage, and with
shotyng and fightyng they draue their enemies clene out of the place &amp;
slew of them and chiefly of the Frenchmen CCC. whiche lay there dead
in sight when the Erle came thither, beside suche as dyed of woundes &amp;
were drouned. Then the Scottes remoued their ordinaunce, in great
hast ouer the water, and by that tyme was the Erle of Surrey come wt
v.M. men on horsbacke &amp; all his great army folowed &amp; was very sory
that his enemies were gone, &amp; muche praised sir Willyam Lyle for his
valiauntnes.
               When the duke of Albany &amp; the lordes of Scotland knew that the
erle of Surrey approched with his puissant army, they thought it not
conuenient to ieoparde all the nobilitie of Scotlande in one felde, consideryng
their chaunce x. yeres before, and therfore they cōcluded to returne,
and so on the sayd secōd day of Nouember in the night the duke
with all his armye retreated more for his suertie then honor.
               The horsemen of Scotland kept the fordes that no mā should passe
to greue the fotemen as they returned, and when all the baggages wer
gone they cast them selfes in a plumpe and returned.
               When the day appeared, then the Englishmen might plainly see the
Scottes how they fled fiftie mennes thickenes, many a lusty Englishman

would faine haue folowed them on horsbacke, and so would therle
of Surray with all his heart, but his cōmission was only to defend the
realme and not to inuade Scotland, whiche thing him sore displeased.
Thus brake vp the great army of Scotland to the great rebuke of the
duke of Albany &amp; the nobles of Scotland whiche .ii. yere together had
made bragges &amp; assembles and durst not abide battaile. The Scottes
made much bragges that they had beaten doune the walles of Warke
castle, but they spake nothyng of their men that they left there, nor how
cowardly they returned &amp; would not abide. After this returne quene
Margaret of Scotlād &amp; mother to the yong kyng, sent to her brother
the kyng of England for an abstinence of warre to be taken betwene y•
realme of England and Scotland to thentent that some way might be
taken, that an amitie might be had betwene them: whiche request to her
was graunted, and so the great armye of England was dissolued and
the Erle of Surrey returned to the coast.
               In this season the Emperor Charles sent to the kyng of Englād .ii.
Mules trapped in crimosyn veluet curiously enbrodered,A pre

                  des:
and to the quene he sent two Mules with riche trappers and high
chayers after the Spanishe fashion, all these presētes wet thankefully
receiued both of the kyng and quene.
               Now let vs returne to the Duke of Suffolke whiche lay at Cordes
or Esqwerdes the .xx. day of September &amp; thither came to him y• army
of Flaunders, wherof was capitaine the lorde of I
                     •
                  il
                     •
                  teyne which had
with him of Spaniardes, Almaines, Cleues and other .iii.M. fotemen
and .v.C. horsemen well apparelled for the warres in all pointes.
               The duke of Suffolke beyng thus furnished passed forward in wete
wether makyng bridges &amp; wayes, euer lokyng for battel, &amp; on the .xvii.
day of October he sent the lorde Sandes Marshall of his armye, and
with him .iii.M. men to a good toune called Anker whiche accompanied
with diuers knightes &amp; gentlemen in good order of battail marched
towarde the toune. The Frenchmen perceiuyng the Englishmen
cōmyng toward their toune, fled out as fast as they might, and left the
toune desolate: then entred the Englishmen and had there a great botie
and toke the cas
                     •
                  le called Bone gard▪ and therin put a garrison of Englishemen,
whereof was capitaine the lorde Leonard Gray brother to
the Marques Dorset to conduict vitailers to the armye, whiche nowe
was farre from any succours of the Englishe part. In this toune was
an abbay of Monkes whiche receiued humbly the lordes and nobles of
England, whiche to them did no hurt nor dammage, and then they returned
to the duke.
               After this, the .xix. day, the Duke with his armye passed to a village

called Qwede: and there, after long coūsailyng it was determined that
the whole army should passe to a s
                     •
                  rong toune and wel fortefied called
Bray, whiche toune was well ordinaunced and had in it .xvi.C. men of
warre, the capitaine therof was called Adrian, and for succours to the
toune were come Mounsire Po
                     •
                  tdormy, the Vicount Larnerdam, the
Vicount Turraine, Moūsire Applyngcort, &amp; Mounsire Dāpney, with
v.C. horsmen, so that in the toune beside the inhabitauntes wer .ii.M.
good men. This toune standeth on the riuer of Some .xxiiii. Englishe
myle from Arras, and xiiii. myles aboue Amyas: This toune was well
diched and strengthned on euery side.
               The .xx. day of this moneth the Duke cōmaunded al his great ordinaūce
to be brought by .iiii. of the clocke in the mornyng before y• toune
of Bray, they that had the charge therof so manfully acquited thē that
notwithstādyng all ye damage that their enemies could do, brought the
ordinaunce before the toune at y• houre appointed. Then eche part shot
dredfully at other, but the Englishe gūners shot so wel, that the walles
of the toune were beaten doune &amp; rased with the ordinaunce, insomuche
that by .ix. of the clocke the toune was made assautable. Then the duke
caused to blow to thassaut. Then the Englishmen &amp; Flemynges &amp; Burgonions
lept furth quickely, and notwithstandyng that the diches wer
depe, yet they so coragiously entered by the good comfort of the lorde
Sādes &amp; other noble men that they gat y• di
                     •
                  hes. The Frenchmen perceiuyng
that the toune should be gotten, hastely made traynes of gunpouder
from strete to strete &amp; house to house, saiyng that the Englishmen
after their entry into ye toune would fal to pillage, &amp; then sodainly
sodain fyer should destroy them. This was the prouision of the Frēchmen:
by this tyme the Englishmen wer enteryng on the walles, and the
Frenchmen stode yet at defence with pikes, cros
                     •
                  owes, handgunnes, &amp;
halberdes, but they were to weke, for on all partes entred thenglishmen
and sodainly the Frenchmen fledde and the Englishemen folowed and
killed and slew in euery part.
               Nowe you must vnderstand that this toune of Bray standeth on the
riuer of Some whiche is there deuided in diuers braunches &amp; betwene
euery braūche is a marishe ground, where on the farside of yetoune was
fortefied a Bulwarke ful of ordinaunce to kepe the passage ouer ye water,
&amp; the Frenchmen had losed the plankes of the bridge nere a myle aboue
Bray, &amp; the horsmen of Fraūce passed by a myle which was to the
Frēchfotemen a great ayd, for thei stode &amp; kept the passage til ye fotemē
wer come ouer the bridge, &amp; then they plucked away the plāckes of the
bridge, so that nomā shuld folow, but euer thenglishmen folowed &amp; cast
plākes on the bridge &amp; passed ouer the bridge, in which passyng diuers
wer drouned, but wt great trauail all men passed, horsmen &amp; fotemen, &amp;
fiersly assauted the Bulwarke and toke it with all the ordinaunce, &amp; in
it was taken capitaine Adrian and capitaine Ulterlew. The Englishe

horsmen folowed the Frenchmen &amp; diuers of them wer slaine and takē,
sir Robert Iernyngham brake a spere on the lorde Pountdormy. The
lorde Leonard Gray did valiaūtly that day. You must remember that
when the Frenchmen issued out of the toune, they forgatte not to lay a
matche to the traine of gunnepouder whiche they had made, whiche in
short space set the toune al on fyer, so that when thenglishmen returned
again, al was on fyer, so that there they ha
                     •
                   litle profite but wyne, whiche
to them did great pleasure. This was the toune of Bray taken and
destroyed the xx. day of October.
               The duke consideryng that litle succours were for him and his souldiers
in the toune of Bray because the sayd toune was consumed with
fyer, he therfore cōmaunded the bridges to be wel repayred for to passe
ouer the great riuer of Some into the realme of Fraūce: and when the
passage was sure, the lord Sandes the .xxi. day of October in the mornyng
was prest to passe ouer with the vaward. Then some gentlemen
sayd that they would passe no farther forward, &amp; diuers souldiers were
on thesame opinion. It was asked why they should feare, and they answered
that if they were past ouer the riuer▪ they were past all succours
and vitail, none could be brought to them. By reason of this noyse the
souldiers stayed, whiche ye lord Sādes perceiuyng, sayd to the Welshmen
whiche wer euil willyng to passe ye riuer: sirs sayd he, behold what
I do, and with that he toke a banner of sainct George &amp; sayd, as many
as loue the kyng of England &amp; be true to him and to the croune, folow
me▪ and then he and sir Wylliam Kyngston set forward and passed the
water, whiche there tunneth in thre streames, then all other persones
coragiously folowed, and the ordinaunce and vitailes.
               After the foreward folowed the duke and al his battail: At this tyme
the army was sore minished by reason many wer diseased and from the
host departed, so the host was not of that strength that it was at the settyng
out of Calayce. When thenglishemen were passed, then folowed
the Burgonions in good order, and so that night this army came to a
toune called Kappe and there encamped theimselfes, all the inhabitauntes
were fled bothe out of the toune and Castle: there thenglishemen
found C. tonne of wyne, &amp; other good pillage. The garrison that
lay at Anker knowyng that y• duke was passed the riuer of Some, rased
the toune &amp; castle, and came &amp; ioyned with y• dukes army at Kappe.
               There the duke caused proclamacions to be made in the armye that
all the people of Fraunce that would vitaile the armye of Englande
should be well entreated &amp; haue their vitailes well payed for, and safe
goyng and cōmyng, by the whiche proclamacion the host was well vitailed,
for the people of y• countrey resorted with all thynges necessarie.
               The Duke thus liyng at Cap sent to the toune of Roy to yeld them
to the kyng of England. The toune perceiuyng that their power was
not able to withstand the great armye of the Duke, assented to deliuer
the toune to the Duke. This was a strong toune well walled, dyched

and ordinaunced but not manned, the Duke sent thither sir Richard
Cornwall and other with .iiii.C. men to receiue the toune, whiche went
thither in good array and had the toune to them deliuered and then
they sette the banner of sainct George in the highest part of the toune,
and full well this garrison kept the toune of Roy til the duke came thither
with his whole armye.
               The Duke &amp; his armye the .xxv. day of the sayd moneth remoued to
a village called Lyhome, &amp; had there great pillage: for this toune was
muche haunted of marchauntes and there kept great markettes. The
next day he remoued to Dauenker, and the ▪xxvii. day he remoued and
came before y• strong toune of Mountdedier, where for defēce of warre
lacked neither diches, walles, nor bulwarkes: The horsmen of the Englishe
army rode about the toune to vew it, at whō the capitaines caused
diuers pieces to be losed whiche shewed well their strength. The
duke sent an officer of armes to somon the capitain to deliuer ye toune:
the officer departed, &amp; with him a trumpet whiche blew before the gate,
but no person would answere, because they would haue no Sommons
made to them: the officer of armes returned and made report. Then the
Dukes skyrers made profer afore the toune, out of the whiche issued
a great compaignie of horsemen and skyrmished with the Dukes
horsemen and fought valiantly, but at the last .xl. of the horsemen were
taken, with whiche the lorde Roche Baron capitaine of the toune was
sore displeased, yet he thought him able to maintaine the toune against
the whole armye. Then the Duke of Suffolke pytched his felde and
layd his siege rounde about the toune of Mountdedier and kept good
watche and warde on euery side: whiche thyng the lorde Roche Baron
perceiuyng comforted his menne of warre and bad them not be afrayd
but to be of good corage, and sayd that the Duke there should get 
                     •
                  othyng.
When the Duke had thus planted his siege, he considered
that he was farre from reskew, and that liyng still and nothyng 
                     •
                   oyng
was not profitable, he knewe also by report of the prisoners that in the
toune of Moundedier were two thousand footemen, and one thousand
horsemen, wherefore he sent for all the lordes and capitaines of his a
                     •
                  
                  my
and muche praised their hardynes and sayd that the noble corrage
that he sawe in theim did muche auaunce him to sette forwarde in all
thynges, the praise wherof should be to them and not to him, and therfore
nowe he encoraged them againe to continue still in their valiaunt
doyng, for with Goddes grace he entended to bend his ordinaunce the
next mornyng before the toune, to the whiche all the lordes agreed and
praised muche the dukes corage and forwardnes.
               Then was sir Willyam Skeuyngton knight, Maister of the ordinaunce
cōmaunded to prepare for the battery, whiche with all diligēce
made trenches, and prepared all thinges mete for the purpose. In this
season sir Ihon Walop knight had with him almost a M. proper men
and hardy, hauyng litle wages or none whiche liued alonely on their
auenture, wherfore of some they were called aduenturers, of some they

were called kreekars. These men wer light, hardy, and politike, and by
their manhod and hardines had robbed many tounes, taken many prisoners,
with great boties, &amp; daily brought to the army Horses, Mares,
vitaile, cloth, corne, &amp; other necessaries whiche might not be misled. Of
this company the Frenchemen and especially they of villages &amp; passegers
wer sore afrayde, for they were neuer idle but doyng some thyng
in one part or other. The lorde Pountdormy, or Pountreny hearyng
Mountdedyer was besieged, called to him diuers great lordes &amp; capitaines
to the nomber of .v.C. menne of armes and dimy launces, and a
great nomber of fotemen, entendyng to bryng gunnepouder and other
necessaries to the toune of Moūtdedier: &amp; as they wer thither cōmyng
by night, Thomas Palmer, capitain of the skout watche of thenglishe
army them askried and skyrmished with them although they wer more
in nomber: manfully fought the Frenchemen, but for all that they were
compelled to flee backe, and then Englishmen them 
                     •
                  olowed and slewe
diuers, and two speres were broken on the brother of the lorde Pountdorny,
but by the swyftnes of his horse he saued himselfe, and in this
chase were C. prisoners taken whiche muche reioysed the Englishmen.
               When the Master of the ordinaunce had all thinges ready, at the
houre of .iiii. of the clocke in the mornyng he discharged the ordinaūce
continually in suche fashion, that by viii. of the clocke the .xxviii. day of
October the walles were made lowe &amp; the toune assautable. All whiche
while, the great ordinaunce shot still out of the toune tyll the walles &amp;
toune were beaten doune. The capitaine of the toune perceiuyng this,
called to him al the capitaines, declaryng to them that their toune was
in .iiii. houres made assautable, and that surely the Englishmen would
assaute the toune whiche should be to their cōfusion, wherfore he asked
their aduise what was best to be done, al thei answered, do as you will:
Then he went into a tower &amp; caused a trompet to blowe and set furth a
banner of truce. Then the duke cōmaunded the ordinaunce to cease.
Then sir Willyā Skeuyngton came to the walles &amp; demaunded what
they would, &amp; the lord Roche Baron sayd, that if it pleased the duke for
the loue of the kyng of England &amp; his honor, to graūt to him &amp; thother
gentlemen that wer there, licence to depart with life, bagge &amp; baggage,
thei would deliuer the toune of Mountdedier. Then sir Willyā Skeuyngton
made report to the duke, whiche therto cōsented, saiyng: they
be men of warre, their riches is not great. Then the lorde Sandes and
diuers other weee appointed to receiue the toune, &amp; so they entred &amp; set
their stādardes on the top of the gates, &amp; toke the keys of all the strong
houses, towers, and Bulwarkes. The Frenchemen were readye to depart
with trussages and cariages, with Crosbowes, Pykes, &amp; Handgunnes,
with whiche doyng the lorde Sandes and the Englishemen
which wer within the toune wer not cōtent, &amp; sayd that the Frenchmen
should passe without weapon: on this point was muche alteraciō and
the Frenchemen were stayed, but the lorde Roche Baron gaue many
fayre wordes and passed forwarde with a red standard, with a white

crosse before him, that seyng sir Thomas Palmer, ranne to the stādard
and plucked it in pieces. Then sayd the Lorde Roche Baron that it
was vngently done: To whom he answered that he should beare no
standard there like a conqueror. Then after long disputacion the
Frenchemen sayd, that it was promised theim that they should haue
their weapons and baggage, and so vpon that they were suffered to
depart. The fotemen likewise had a standard before them whiche was
rent by sir Robert Iernyngham. The nomber whiche departed truely
accompted, were two thousand footemen, fiue hundreth horsemen and
odde wel and warlike appointed, and they left muche baggage behynd
them, because they sawe the Englishemen so fast come into the toune,
they were in feare of losse of all.
               When the Frenchmen wer departed, the duke with his whole army
entred the toune and there the Englishemen founde fine f
                     •
                  the
                     •
                  beddes,
napery, coueringes, and muche houshold stuffe, and especially of wyne
great plentie, and there the armye tested till the last day of October,
and then were all the gates of the toune rased and throwen doune, and
all the Bulwarkes likewise. Then the duke caused all the ordinaunce
to be taken and so remoued to the toune of Roye, where 
                     •
                  e and all his
armye rested for a while: wherof they were glad, for they had trauailed
sore, and the wether was wette and colde. On the feast of all sainctes
called Alhalon daye, the Duke in the chiefe Churche of R
                     •
                  y made
knightes the lorde Harbert, the lorde Powes, Olyuer Manners, Arthur
Pole, Richard Sandes, Robert Iernyngham, Robert Sailsbury,
Edmond Benyngfelde, Richard Corbet, Thomas Wentworthe,
Wyllyam Storton, Water Mantell, George warran, Edward Seymour
after erle of Hartford, and now Duke of Sommerset, and moste
worthy Gouernor of the kynges maiesties persone and Protector of al
his realmes, dominions and subiectes.
               The morowe after, the armye remoued to a place called Neele, there
the Burgonions beganne to waxe wery, and so did the Englishemen,
for euery day was foule wether and raine bothe day and night.
Wherfore dyuers companies fell to grudgyng saiyng, nowe you may
see that by our remouyng we shall be ledde from place to place all this
wynter, whiche is to the vtter losse of our lyues: for dayly we see that of
our company dyeth no smal nomber (and trueth it was that some dyed
but not many) they sayd farther, the Burgonions haue the great gaine
and do lest for it, for they haue wagons and carye their boties to their
countrey, whiche is nere hand, and we go before and 
                     •
                  ight, and we haue
no meanes to conuey any thing into our coūt
                     •
                  ey for lacke of carryage,
and so we bete the bushe and they take the byrdes. This grudge was
seassed by gentle wordes for a tyme.
               In these iorneys was cōmonly spoken that the duke of Burbon with
his .x.M. Almaynes would haue inuaded Fraunce and so ioyned with
this army, but y• truth was cōtrary, for he turned his host another way

and went into prouince and layde siege to Marcelles, wherof the duke
b
                     •
                  yng aduertised, not a litle mused, and also seyng his menne daily fall
s
                     •
                  cke, was sory, and yet he so comforted theim that euery man was glad
to folowe his will and entent.
               On the .vi. day of Nouember the lorde Sandes beyng capitaine of
the foreward, and the duke of the middle ward, and sir Richard Wyngfeld
capitaine of the rereward came in order of battail prest to fight, to
a village called Ueane and there rested for that night, and the morow
after the whole army returned againe ouer the water of Some, &amp; came
to a place called Beaufford: At this passage the duke made knightes
Ihon Dudley, and Robert Utreyght esquiers.
               The viii. day ye duke remoued to a place called Mount sainct Martyne
a very mete place for an armye, and then was the dukes iustruccions
loked vpō by the capitaines, and they perceiuyng that they hard
nothyng of the duke of Burbons commyng, ayde nor counsail, all they
thought and determined to send the lorde Sandes in post to the kyng,
to declare all the case as it stode &amp; their necessitie accordyng as he him
selfe knew and saw in all pointes: whiche lorde Sandes tooke great
paine and made good diligence toward the kyng, and while he was ridyng,
the duke remoued his armye to a place called Permount &amp; there
lodged for a tyme to rest, and the army was well vitailed, but euer the
W
                     ••
                  shemen muttered and grudged more and more.
               After the great raynes and wyndes that had fallen, came a feruent
frost,A great frost. so sore that many a souldier dyed for colde, some lost fyngers and
some toes, but many lost their nailes of their handes, whiche was to thē
a great grefe. The duke all this notwithstandyng remembryng that
he came not thither to lye styl, the .xiii. day remoued to a place two myle
from the castle of Bowhen and still it frised, insomuche that the master
of the Ordinaunce was compelled of necessitie to set the wheles of his
ordinaunce on hardels for sinkyng. In the mornyng the Welshemen
set out a shout and cryed, home▪ home, the krekers hearyng that, cryed
hang, hang. For whiche matter deuision was like to haue fallen, but by
policie it was ceased. Sir Edward Gyldfod capitaine of the horsmen
vewed the castle of Bowhen or Boghan, whiche euer was thought to
be impregnable, but he iudged it might be wonne, for the castle was
inuironed with Marryses, so that to no mans iudgement it was possible
to wynne it: But nowe he perceiued that the frost was so great and
strong that it might be beseaged, &amp; all that night it fresed againe: wherfore
he desired the Duke to geue him leaue to assaute it whiche thereto
agreed. Then he caused the ordinaūce to be set furth ouer the marrish.
When they within the castle perceiued that the marrishe fayled theim,
they were sore dismayed. Then sir Edward Guildeford shot thre great
pieces at the castle, and the castilian shot thre pieces againe. Then as
the Englishe gunners wer preparing to the battery, the capitain seyng
his castle could not hold, by reason that the ma
                     •
                  ishe failed, and that he

could defende none assault, deliuer the castle to him to the behofe of the
Emperor and the kyng of England, and after a small communicacion
had betwene the sayd sir Edwarde Guyldforde and the capitaine, the
capitaine with all his retinue departed leuyng behynd the ordinaunce
of bombardes, curtawes, &amp; deiny curtaux, slinges, canons, volgers, and
other ordinaunce, there were lxxvi. pieces, plentie of pellettes &amp; pouder.
The duke of Suffolke perceiuyng that this castle stode on the border
of Henaude: Wherfore the more to please the Henawers he made capitaine
of thesame castle of Boghan the Seneshal of Henaude, to the behofe
of the Emperor and the kyng of England. In this place the army
was euil vitailed, because the Frenchemen had stopped the water of
Some, that no vitaile should passe ouer the riuer: wherfore the Duke
sent to them of Henaude &amp; specially to theim of Ualencien to haue ayde
of vitaile, which of their litle sent to the army a litle, but yet it did them
some seruice, and all this while the feruent frost with bitter windes cō
                  tinued,
which caused many people to dye: yet still lay the army abidyng
the answer of the lord Sandes, whiche as you haue heard rode in post
&amp; somuche trauailed that he came to the king of England to his castle
of Wyndsore and there declared to the kyng his message, whiche was
that his people which wer in the Frenche ground abode muche misery,
for the wether was wet, the wayes depe, long nightes and short dayes,
great iorneys and litle vitaile, which caused the souldiers daily to dye.
Also they trusted when they passed the seas accordyng to their instruccions
to haue had ayde of the Duke of Burbon (of whom sith their departyng
they neuer heard worde) wherfore the Duke of Suffolke and
other nobles of your army haue sēt me to your highnes to declare their
state and condicion, their good will to tary, &amp; the euil chaunces whiche
daily happeneth to them by God and not by their enemies. Well sayd
the kyng all this we knewe before your cōmyng: wherfore we haue appointed
the lorde Mountioy with .vi.M. men to passe the seas for the
relefe of our army, whiche lorde Mountioy is almost in a redynes: For
we will in nowise that the army shall breake.
               Then the kyng came to Westminster to the Cardinals place &amp; there
receiued letters from the duke of Suffolke by sir Robert Iernyngham
of the gettyng of the castle of Boghan or Bowen: wherfore incōtinent
it was by the kyng and his counsail determined that the lord Moūioy
should make spede, whiche did suche diligence that many of his souldiers
were come to Lōdon wel harnissed and weponed redy to passe the
seas. Wherfore the kyng sent in all hast sir Robert Iernyngham again
to declare to the duke the kinges pleasure and what ayde was cōmyng
towarde him. But or sir Robert Iernyngham could come to the duke
the armye was remoued from Bohan and brent the toune, and so came
to the citie of Ualencine in Henaude, &amp; there layde vp their ordinaunce
and from thence came to the citie of Turnay (whiche then was vnder

the Emperor and out of the Frenche kynges handes) and so toke their
iornay homewarde thorow Flaunders and the army there broken and
dispatched. But when the duke mette with sir Robert Iernyngham at
Bridges in Flaunders and knewe the kynges mynde and entent, he
did what he might to retreate the souldiers, which could not be, for many
Englishemen shipped at Andwarpe, and many at Sluyes, and at
Newport and other hauens, and they that were at Calayce were steyed
for a tyme, but when the Duke sawe that he could not bryng all his
army together scacely the .iiii. part, he then licensed the remnaunt to depart.
Of this breakyngvp of the armye were letters sent to the kyng,
whiche incontinent stopped the lorde Mountioy and sent his men into
the countrey againe. The Duke and other capitaines hearyng of the
Kynges displeasure, were sore abashed, and did write to their frendes
that they had perfite knowlege that the Duke of Burbon had broken
vppe his campe for the extremitie of the Wynter, and also shewed that
their souldiers dyed, and vita
                     •
                  l failid, whiche caused them to breake the
army, for of trueth the souldiers would not abide: with whiche reasons
the kyng was somewhat appeased and so on good hope the duke came
to Calayce the .xii. day of December, &amp; there abode long, till their frendes
had sued to the kyng for their returne. And when it was graunted
and that they were returned, the Duke and the capitaines came not to
the kynges presence in a long season, to their great heauynes and displeasure:
But at the last all thinges were taken in good part and they
well receiued and in great loue, fauor, and familiaritie with the kyng.
               Whyle the Duke of Suffolke was in Fraunce and the Erle of
Surrey on the Marches of Scotland, the Cardinall sent out cōmissions
in the moneth of October through the realme, that euery man that
was worth .xl. l. should pay the whole subsidie before graunted out of
hand &amp; before the dayes of payment. This payment was called an Anticipacion,An Anticipacion.
which is to say a thing taken or a thing cōmyng before his
tyme or season: This terme was new to y• commaltie, but thei payd wel
for their learnyng, for their money was paied out of hand wtout delay.
               The kyng this yere kept his Christmas solempnely at his castle of
Wyndsore and thither came to him the third day of Ianuarye the erle
Pountiuer of the royal bloud of Brytaigne and pretēdyng to be duke
of the same, whiche was nere cosyn to the duke of Burbon &amp; bannished
Fraunce. This erle came hastely from the duke of Burbon &amp; was well
entertained and feasted of the kyng, and after answere made to him by
the kyng, he went to the Cardinal to Hampton court, and so with great
spede returned to the sayd duke into the countrey of Prouince.
               In the same season was brought to the court a gentleman of Scotland
called Andrew Stewart taken on the sea with diuers letters by
one Water Iago a yoman of the kynges, with diuers letters from the
duke of Albany to the Frenche kyng, by reason wherof the kyng knew

muche of their counsail. This gentleman payed raunsome and was
very sone redemed.
               The .xix. day of Ianuary vi. fayre shippes of Fraunce well appointed,
mette with a shippe of the kynges of England called the Kateryne
Galley a shippe of .xl. tonne, the capitain wherof was one Ihon Mariner,
with a small company, for many of his company were a land: But
he so encoraged his menne that all feare was sette aside, and euer as the
Frenchemen approched, they bet theim of with arrowes pykes, &amp; fightyng,
&amp; styll this continued frō .iiii. of the clocke in the mornyng till .ix.
of the clocke, &amp; euer on the cost of Englād, and the Englishmen did the
best they could to saue themselfes: For by that tyme she had spent her
pouder, arrowes with shotyng, &amp; her bylles with hewyng, &amp; her pykes
with kepyng them of from cōmyng aborde, and al the company almost
sore hurte, and the capitaine wounded to the death, so that they had no
other remedy but to sayle. This chace was perceiued by one called capitain
Markam, capitain of the barke of Sandwyche, whiche māfully
called his men together out of Sandwyche hauen &amp; with good wynde
came to reskue the Kateryne Galley. The .vi. shippes perceiuyng that,
left their chace &amp; made with the Barke of Sandwyche. The capitaine
coragiously comforted his men and made the quarters of his ship defensable.
The Frenchmen sette on fiersly, and their toppes were higher
then the toppe of the Englishe ship. Out went the ordinaunce, quarels
and dartes of the Frenche shippes: the Englishmen shot fiersly againe
and when the Frenchemen profered to enter, the Englishmen bet them
of with bylles. The Frenchemen at last with a great gunne bet doune
the toppe of the barke &amp; slewe the men in thesame, and lastly they strake
doune his Mast. This conflict continued from .x. of the clocke tyll two
at after noone. Then he could make no shift, but to saile: and euer the
Englishmen shot arrowes, &amp; while thenglishmen had any arrowes the
Frenchemen durst not enter: But when their arrowes were spent, the
Frenchemen came aborde all at ones &amp; entred the barke. In this fight
were slaine of Frenchmen out of hand .xxvii. and .lxxx. sore hurt, and of
the Englishe were slaine .xxiii. What should I say, the Englishemen
fought valiauntly, but they were to weake for .vi. tall shippes. Wherfore
they were taken and brought to Depe for a prise, but the Frenchmen
sayd they neuer bought prise so dere. After this Ihon Maryner
capitaine of the Kateryne galey dyed, and many Frenchemen that wer
hurt dyed at Depe, so that neither part wanne greatly.
               In the last moneth called December were taken certain traytors in
the citie of Couentry,An insurre
                        •

kynges Henxmen, and one Christopher Pykeryng clerke of y• Larder,
and one Antony Maynuile gentleman, which by the persuasion of the
sayd Fraunces Philip, entended to haue taken the kynges treasure of
his subsidie as the Collectors of thesame came towarde London, and
then to haue araised men and taken the castle of Kylingworth, and then

to haue made battaile against the kyng: wherfore the sayd Fraunces,
Christopher and Anthony wer hanged, drawen, and quartered at Tyborne
the xi. day of Februarye, the residue that were taken, were sent to
the citie of Couentry and there wer executed. One of the kynges Henxmen
called Dygby which was one of the conspirators fled the realme,
and after had his pardon.
               The .xvii. day of Ianuary ther was a Fayer or market at the toune
of Marguyson in the Frenche kynges dominions beside Calayce, and
for defence of the people and their marchaundise, there were appointed
CC. men in harnes wel weaponed: The souldiers of Guysnes hearyng
of this, departed in the night &amp; came nere to the toune of Marguyson
and closly kept themselfes tyll the Market was fayre &amp; at the best, then
the Englishmen whiche wer .lxx. archers and bylles, set sodainly on the
Market, that seyng the Frenchemen stode manfully at their defence wt
handgunnes and pykes, but the Englishmen shotte so wholy together
that they draue the Frenchmen out of the toune, and would for succors
haue taken the Churche, but the Englishemen were betwene theim and
the Churche, so that they had none other remedye but to flee and many
Frenchemen were slaine. Capitain Ihon de Pound, and capitain Ihō
de Babage and diuers other were taken prisoners, and diuers marchauntes
that were there to sell their goodes were also taken, and all
their goodes brought in Frenchemennes wagons to Guysnes and no
Englishman slaine but diuers were sore hurt.
               The fyrst day of Februay the valiant knight sir Robert Iernynghā
and with him fifty demylaūces of the garrison of Calayce skoured the
countrey to Odirsaell &amp; there toke a C. hedde of beastes, by that doyng
an ask
                     •
                  y rose through the countrey, wherby the Frenchemen gathered
together to the nomber of .xii. score, and or sir Robert and his company
came to Houndyngbrige they were beset round about, so that of necessitie
they must fight, the Frenchmen set on with hādgunnes, crosbowes
and pykes, and for a while there was a strong encountre, but the Englishmen
as m
                     •
                  nne desperate (because of the nomber) fought so fiersly
that they caused the Frenchmen to geue backe and slewe many of them
and toke .xiii. prisoners, &amp; in the chace they toke vii. more whiche made
vp .xxi. Then the sayd sir Robert returned with his botie and prisoners
and lost noman, but almoste all were hurt.
               The .x. day of Marche the kyng hauyng a newe harnes made of his
own deuise and fashion, sucheas no armorer before that tyme had seen,
thought to assaye thesame at the tilte, and appointed a Iustes to serue
him. On fote were appointed the lorde Marques Dorset and the Erle
of Surrey, the kyng came to the one ende of the tylt, and the Duke of
Suffolke to the other: then a gentleman sayd to the Duke, sir the kyng
is come to the tyltes ende.
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   I see him not sayd the Duke on my fayth, for
my head piece taketh frō me my sight: with these wordes God knoweth
by what chaunce, the kyng had his spere deliuered him by the lorde

Marques, the vi
                     •
                  er of his headpece beyng vp and not doune nor fas
                     •
                  ened,
so that his face was clene naked. Then the gentleman sayd to the
duke, sir the king commeth, then the duke set forward and charged his
spere, and the kyng likewise vnaduisedly set toward ye duke: the people
perceiuyng the kynges face bare, cryed hold, hold, the duke neither saw
nor heard, and whether the kyng remembred that his viser was vp or
no few could tell: Alas what sorow was it to the people when they saw
the spleters of the dukes spere strike on the kynges hedpiece: For of a
suertie the duke strake the kyng on the brow right vnder the de
                     •
                  ēce of y•
hedpece on the verye coyffe s
                     •
                  u
                     •
                  l or bas
                     •
                  enetpece wherevnto the barbet
for power and defence is charneld, to whiche coyffe or bassenet neuer armorer
taketh hede, for it is euermore couered with the viser, barbet and
volant pece, and so that pece is so defended that it forseth of no charge:
But when y• spere on that place lighted, it was great ieopardy of death
insomuche that the face was bare, for the Dukes spere brake all to shyuers,
and bare the kynges viser or barbet so farre backe by the countre
buffe that all the kynges headpece was full of spleters. The Armorers
for this matter were muche blamed, and so was the lorde Marques for
the deliueryng of the spere when his face was open, but the kyng sayd
that none was to blame but himself, for he entended to haue sayed him
selfe and his sight. The duke incontinently vnarmed him, and came to
the kyng, shewyng him the closenes of his sight, &amp; sware that he would
neuer runne against the kyng more: But if the kyng had been a lytle
hurt, the kynges seruauntes would haue put the Duke in ieopardy.
               Then the kyng called his Armorers and put all his peces together and
then toke a spere and ranne vi. courses very well, by the whiche all men
might perceiue that he had no hurt, whiche was great ioy and comfort
to all his subiectes there present.
               In the ende of Februarye foure Frenche shippes chased the Fysher
botes of Rye to the verye shore, and when the fludde was gone, would
haue taken the botes and came a land with pikes, but the fishers threw
stones, and one archer shotte and slewe a Frencheman whiche helde vp
a basket and bad shote Englisheman shote, and the Englisheman shot
through the basket and slewe him, and so they saued their botes, and
when the fludde came, the Frenchemen sette vp their sailes, and as they
were passyng, the Englishemen of warre mette with theim and tooke
two of the sayd shippes, and the other two fled.
               In this yere the kyng sent the lorde Morlay sir Wyllyam Hosy
knight and doctor Lee his Almoner to Done Ferdinando archduke of
Austrice and brother to the Emperour Charles with the order of the
Garter whiche in the toune of Norryngberge receiued the same, where
then were all the princes of Germanye assembled at a counsel or Dyet,
against the bishop of Rome, against whom the Germaynes put a C.
greues.
               
                  
The xiii. day of Aprill one Capitain Breerton one of the capitaines
of the auenturers at Guysnes with .xvi. tall men came to village called
Waste and there toke a bootie of beastes, by whiche takyng an askry
rose, and by chaunce certain of the garrison of Bulleyn were then
abrode and by the cry of the people came where the Englishemen were,
the Frenchemen wer CC. horsemen and with great cryes enuiro
                     •
                  ed the
Englishemen about, so that the Englishemen could make no defence.
Then capitain Brearton called to the capitain of the Frenchemen and
sayd, sir I am a gētleman &amp; this enterprice was myne, I haue brought
these good felowes to this ieopardy, wherfore we yelde vs al prisoners
to you, and so they deliuered their weapons, the capitain was a gentleman
and gently them receiued, then to the menne of warre drewe all the
pe
                     •
                  santz or chorles of the coūtrey nye hand to the nomber of vii. or viii.
score, whiche desired to bye y• Englishmen that wer takē, the Frenchmen
were content and toke money, then the Englishmen were deliuered to
the vplandishe people, and the men of warre rode away.
               When the menne of warre were departed the rybaudes with pykes,
iauelyns,Capitaine Brearton murdered. and knyues, fell on the Englishemen whiche had no weapon
and them slewe all xvii. and cutte theim in pieces the moste shamefully
that euer was sene.
               When knowlege hereof was brought to the capitain of Guisnes sir
Ihon Gage, he sent for the auenturers willyng theim to reuenge their
capitaines death. So all the aduenturers the xiiii. day gathered together
to the nomber of .xl. archers and pykes, and by good guide the
next day in the mornyng they came to the same village of Wast &amp; there
toke xxxvii. prisoners and moste part were at the murder of Brearton
and his company,The murder 
                        •
                     euenged. and of the xxxvii. they slew xxxvi. and so they left one
and caried him with them, but or they departed they set the toune on
fyer and spared nothyng, their ire was so great: the menne of warre of
Fraunce costed the Englishmen, but they would not medle with them
in that rage.
               When they came to Guysnes they sware the Frencheman that was
left on liue to declare their message to the capitaine of Bullein, whiche
was that after that day they would saue neither man, woman nor child
that came to their handes for the great crueltie that the peysantz had
done to capitaine Brearton and his company, with whiche message the
Frenchmen were discontent &amp; sayd that the villaynes deserued to haue
vengeaunce for their crueltie.
               In this yere through bookes of Emphimerydes and Pronosticacions
made and calculate by Astronomers, the people were sore affrayde
for the sayd writers declared that this yere should be suche Eclipses in
watery signes, and suche coniunctions that by waters &amp; fluddes many
people should perishe, Insomuche that many persones vitailed them
selfes and went to high groundes for feare of drounyng, and specially

one Bolton which was Prior of saint Bartholomewes in Smythfeld
builded him an house vpō Harow of the hill, only for feare of this flud,Bolton prior of saint Bartholomewes.
and thether he went &amp; made prouision for all thinges necessarye within
him, for the space of two monethes: But the faythfull people put their
trust and confidence onely in God. And this raine was by the wryters
pronosticate to be in February, wherfore when it began to raine in February
the people wer muche afrayd, &amp; some sayd now it beginneth, but
many wisemen whiche thought that the worlde could not be drouned
againe, contrary to Goddes promise, put their trust in him onely, but
because thei thought that some great raines might fall by enclinacions
of the starres, and that water milles might stande styll and not grinde,
they prouided for meale, and yet God be thanked there was not a fairer
season in many yeres, &amp; at the last the Astronomers for their excuse sayd
that in their computacion they had mistaken and miscounted in their
nomber an hundreth yeres.
               The Emperor charles whiche also was enemy to the Frenche kyng,
seyng the great army that the kyng of England his confederate had in
Fraunce, thought it was to him honorable to make warre also on that
part of Fraūce that ioyneth to Spain, &amp; in especially he imagined how
to recouer the toune of Fountraby, whiche the Frenchemen before that
tyme had gotten: wherfore he assembled a great puissaunce and made
capitain the lorde Barnardine de Belasco Constable of Castyle, which
with great diligence came before the toune of Fountraby whiche was
strongly fortefied and the capitain therof was a Naueroys: but when
the capitaine and his compaigny sawe the toune besieged with suche a
puissaunce, and also that the sea was so narowly kept that they could
not haue vitail nor succour, they determined to geue vp the toune: but
yet the capitaine of a high stomacke shotte out his ordinaunce and sent
his trompet to the capitain of the Spanyardes to know what prisoners
he had of his, and for the communicacion thereof he desired abstinence
of warre tyl he had communed with the counsail of the Spanish
host, whiche to him was graunted. Then was communicacion for fiue
dayes and nothyng ended, for the Spanyardes were haute on the one
syde, and the Frenchemen proude on the other syde, but on the vi. day
it was concluded that the toune should be deliuered with ordinaunce
and artillery and all the men of war to depart with bagge &amp; baggage
and so the xxvii. day of February was ye toune of Fountraby brought
againe to the handes of the Emperor, &amp; he that was capitain of Fountraby
was afterwarde restored to his landes in Nauer by the Emperor
and became his man.
               The bishop of Rome called Pope Clement seyng the great warres
that were this yere on all parties and in especial betwene the Emperor

&amp; the kyng of England on the one partie against Fraunces the Frēche
kyng and his alyes, sent an archebishop of the realme of Naples fyrst
to the Frenche kyng, and after to the Emperor, whiche declared to the
Frenche kyng the manyfolde mischiefes that ryse by warre, the great
stroke of vengeaunce that God will strike for vniust warre &amp; specially
for the death of innocentes and effusion of christen bloud, and shewed
farther that the sayd Frenche kyng made daily warre on the Emperor
and the kyng of England without cause, but onely because he himselfe
would do no right to them nor to their subiectes.
               The Frenche kyng after counsail taken answered, my lorde Legate
we assure you that we make no warre, but warre is made on vs, and we
stande at the defence, notwithstandyng our right is kept from vs both
the duchy of Myllain and realme of Naples by the Emperor and the
vsurped duke, to the whiche we haue good title, and the kyng of England
warreth on vs without cause, notwithstāding that we haue geuen
him and many lordes o
                     •
                   his coūsail diuers fayre pencions, not because
we be afrayde of him, but because we would haue his loue and amitie,
and when we perceiued that he toke part with the Emperor our mortal
enemy, we withdrewe our pencions as with right we might, &amp; now with
all his power he would conquere our good will, whiche is against reason,
and we clayme nothing of him. Well sayd the ambassador, I will
speake fyrst with the Emperor and after with the kyng of England, &amp;
then I will declare to you their rightes and demaundes, with whiche
the Frenche kyng semed to be content.
               Then the sayd ambassadour tooke his leaue and in post came to the
Emperor in Spaine, &amp; there exhorted him to peace with many goodly
reasons, affirmyng that the warre was vniust and without reasonable
cause made on the Frenche kyng as the sayd kyng affirmed. Then the
Emperor like a noble prince answered, that the warres were neuer of
his beginnyng: For the Frenche kyng or he wyst had taken the toune
of Fountraby, and also had sent an army to cōquere the realme of Nauer
                     •
                  e,
&amp; not with this contented, reteyned the Swyches whiche be the
Emperors subiectes and caused them to be enemies to thempyre, and
he also withhelde the duchy of haut Burgoyne, and the countie of Arthoys
with diuers other countreys and seignories belongyng to him:
Wherfore his quarel was alway iust, and because the college of Rome
should perceiue the whole cause of his warres, he deliuered to the sayd
ambassador a seedule, with whiche he departed, refusyng all giftes
whiche the Emperor offered him, and came again to the Frenche kyng
and rehersed to him all the Emperors saiyng, but the French kyng him
selfe highly excused and sayd that he might not lese that that his predecessors
left him, and so the bishop of Romes ambassador toke his leaue
and came into England.
               
                  
After this Legate was departed frō the Emperors court, there came
thither an Ambassador from Portyngale, whiche highly behaued him
selfe, and when he came to the Emperors speche, he proudly sayd:The proposicion of a Portyngale. Sir
you that are the greatest prince of Christendome ought aboue all men
to do iustice and right, and to do wrong to no man, and where it is well
knowen that by the labor, studye, and learnyng in Cosmography and
Astronomy of vs only Portyngales, the trade to the parties of Inde or
Indias were fyrst sought and found, and the fyrst labor in that behalf
was ours and the great innumerable riches whiche was spent for the
searchyng and findyng of thesame, was employed &amp; spent by the kyng
of Portyngale and his progenitors, by whiche trauail we haue wonne
straung lādes, wherby all Christendome is greatly enriched wt Iuels,
stones, and perles and other straung commodities. How can it then be
thought iust or righteous that any other persone should take from vs
that cōmoditie that we haue so derely bought? Yet moste puissant lorde
and mightie Emperor, your subiectes daily trauail thither and wrong
fully take away our gayne, whiche neuer labored nor toke pain for the
findyng or serching of thesame, wherfore of iustice you must cōmaunde
your subiectes not alonely to leue their trade thitherwarde, but also to
make to vs Portyngales a sufficient recompence for the harmes that
we haue susteined.
               When the Ambassador had sayd,The Emperors answer▪
                   after a lytle deliberacion the Emperor
answered. The very pouertie of your countrey of Portyngale is
suche, that of your selfes you be not able to liue, wherfore of necessitie
you were driuen to seke liuyng, for landes of princes you were not able
to purchase, and lande of lordes you were not able to conquere. Wherfore
on the sea you were compelled to seke that whiche was not found:
And where you say that you haue found lādes, I say those landes foūd
you by shipwrekes of the sea beyng cast thereon before you thought of
any suche ground, &amp; so sought farther for succours in necessitie, yet they
say not that you haue them wōne, but they haue wōne you. And where
you would that our subiectes should not repare thither, we ascertaine
you that no man shall prohibite our subictes to saile where thei lyst for
their auauntage. For our subiectes may be warned no place by them wt
whom I haue peace and amitie: for he is mine enemy and no frend that
letteth my libertie: Well sayd the Ambassador, and we wil let your subiectes
to passe thither. Nay sayd the Emperor, we wil not trye so farre,
for I am able to disturbe your doynges nerer hand. But for a suertie
you Portyngales be enemies to all Christendome, for to the Indyans
you cary nothyng but coyne, whiche is hurt to all countreys, wherfore
at this tyme you may depart, till you be better aduised. After
this answere geuen to the Portyngales, they offered great
summes of money to the Emperor to leaue his trade
into the Indyans, but he therto in nowyse
would agree.
            
            
               
               The .xvi. yere.
               
                  IN the beginnyng of this xvi. yere the kyng lay at his maner
of Newhall in Essex, and there kept the feast of sainct
George &amp; hearyng that the bishop of Romes Ambassador
was commyng into England remoued to his Manor of
Grenewyche where the sayd Archbishop and legate came
to him &amp; was highly entertained, which declared wisely and eloquently
the message &amp; entent of his master, whiche was to make a peace and cō
                  cord
betwene y• princes of Christendome, &amp; especially betwene the Emperor,
the kyng of Englād &amp; the Frenche kyng, &amp; for that cause he had
been with the Emperor &amp; also with the French kyng, whiche as he sayd
affirmed that without cause the kyng of England made on him warre,
consideryng that he to thentent to haue y• more amitie &amp; fauor of you &amp;
your nobles hath liberally geuen to you &amp; theim honorable pencions,
whiche by no dutie as he affirmeth you can nor may clayme, but of his
beniuolence and bountie. Also he sayeth that you clayme his croune,
realme, and possessions, whiche toucheth him highly, and of yours he
claymeth nothyng, and therfore he thynketh of right you ought not to
make him warre. Wherfore may it please your highnes to tell me your
mynde and I shall it declare to the whole court of Rome God willyng
and forget nothyng.
               Then the kyng called to him his coūsail &amp; after diuers cōsultacions
had, the Ambassador was sent for, &amp; there was shewed to him many recordes,
prouyng the kyng of England to be inheritor to the realme of
Fraūce by bloud &amp; also so cōfirmed by diuers Charters in the tyme of
kyng Charles the vii. And as cōcernyng ye pencion, to him was shewed
diuers Charters, that it was no Pencion of frendship but due rent for
the duches of Normādy &amp; Guyan and the coūtreys of Aniew &amp; Maine
whiche are the kyng of Englandes very enheritaunce. Farthermore
there wer shewed to him diuers bondes of the sayd French kynges for
the payment for the citie of Turnay &amp; other duties whiche he ought to
the kyng of England, all whiche articles to fulfyll, the Frenche kyng
hath oftentymes been required by Ambassadors, &amp; yet he euer dissēbled
&amp; would not conforme himselfe to reason: of all these thinges wer notes
written &amp; deliuered to the bishop of Romes ambassador, which toke his
leue of the kyng &amp; returned in post accompanied but with .iii. persones.
By reason of y• cōmyng of this Ambassador men hoped y• peace should
ensue, but it succeded not this yere: for the third day of May the garrison
of Bullein with diuers other in the moste secrete wise that could be
came to a place within the Englishe pale called Sentricas &amp; sodainly
strake vp a drōme or drounslade: the people hearyng this in the night
wer sore abashed, some fled naked &amp; some clothed, the moste part fled to
the Churche, and the Frenchemen them folowed &amp; toke ..xxi. prisoners

and then set fyer on the Churche: By this tyme was all the pale raised
whiche thyng the Frenchemen perceiuyng left their botie and returned
in all hast with their prisoners to Bullein.
               In this season the lordes of Flaunders lay at the siege before Tyrwyn
and were likely to haue taken it by famyne, whereof the Frenche
kyng beyng aduertised assembled an armye of .xxii.M. horsemen and
fotemen vnder the conduicte of the Duke of Uandosme and the lorde
Pountdormy, and the Frenche kyng himselfe came doune to Amyas
and there caused it to be noysed that he would besege the toune of
Ualencyen in Henaude, where the Duke of Suffolke the last yere had
left the kyng of Englandes ordinaunce. The kyng of England hearyng
of this, sayd, that if the Frenche kyng beseged Ualencyen, he in
person would go thither for to reskue his ordinaunce. The lorde Fynes
and other lordes of Fl
                     •
                  unders whiche lay before Tyrwyn with
ix.M. menne were aduertised of the Frenche armye, but because of the
fame that the host shuld go to Ualencyen, they sent for nomore succors.
               When the Frenchemen had all thynges ready, they lefte the waye to
Ualencyen and tooke the way directly to Tyrwyn. When the lordes
of Flaunders perceiued that they were sore abashed &amp; then they knewe
that they were disceiued, and that they were not able to abyde the puissaunce
of the Frenche army. Wherefore they raysed their siege, &amp; put
thēselfes in order of battail on ye Southest side of Tyrwyn: the French
armye passed forward the vi. day of May towarde Tyrwyn and made
no semblaunce to fight: Howbeit some of theim skyrmished with the
horsemen of Flaunders, but they at the last entered the toune, whervnto
they were welcome, and the lordes of Flaunders departed sore displeased
but there was no remedy. Then ranne a brute that the Frenche
army would lay sege to Guysnes: wherfore the kyng caused men &amp; all
other thynges to be put in a readynes for the spedye reskue thereof if it
had so chaunsed. But the Frenchemen toke a better aduice.
               In this moneth of May sir Robert Iernyngham capitain of Newnam
bridge cōmuned with Christopher Coo, a capitaine of diuers Englishe
shippes that kept the sea, whiche then was in Calayce hauen for
vitaile and sayd, capitain Coo you know how the Bulleners haue visited
nere to Calayce the Englishe pale and haue burned Sentrycas.
If you will promise to set many of your menne a lande at the hauen of
Bullein the .xix. day of Maye, I with as many as I can furnishe will
mete with you there in basse Bulleine at the tyme and houre betwene
vs appointed, to the whiche the sayd Christopher agreed and faithfully
promised, and so prepared accordyngly euerye thyng necessarye
and so sayled towarde Bulleyn, sir Robert Iernyngham sent worde of
this enterprise to sir Willyam Fitzwillyam capitaine of Guysnes to
know if he would ayde any part toward this iorney, whiche sent worde
that he would be at thesame auenture himselfe: then all the gentlemen
desired him to be capitaine of that enterprise, whiche he thākefully and

weth heart receiued: then all the men of warre and the aduenturers and
the Bayly Marke assembled together, so that when all were come together
they wer .CCC. horsemen, and of the coūtrey and Marke .iii.C.
and of the auenturers .C.lx. and so one and other they were vii.C. men.
All these persones mette at an houre appointed at Sandyngfelde: the
night was short so that it was day or they came nere Bullein all set in
good order of battail, but thei were askried before they came nere Bullein,
and so it chaunsed that Christopher Coo with his shippes whiche
had winde at will was come with his .iiii. shippes before Bullein somwhat
before day, the Bulleners that kept the watche him espied, &amp; then
he manned his boates and with men and ordinaunce stretched toward
the land, by that tyme was all basse Bullein in harnes ready to defend
the Englishmen from londyng, but capitaine Coo did what he might,
and almost all the people of Basse Bullein wer on the shore, that seyng
the garrison made them ready and bent their ordinaunce. Sir Willyā
Fitzwillyam hearyng the gunnes toward the hauenside knew wel that
Cristopher Coo was in his busines, and so encoraged euery man to do
well and marched forwarde wt asmuche spede as might be, insomuche
that all the Englishemen were on the hylles before Bullein in sondry
plumpes, then i
                     ••
                  ued out the horsmen of Bullein betwene the castle and
Cardons tower, the light horsmen of the Englishe part theim encountred,
there was a good fight, the Frenchemen shotte with Crosbowes,
and the Englishemen with long bowes, and the great ordinaunce shot
terri
                     •
                  ly, the Englishemen approched the toune walles, this skyrmishe
was 
                     ••
                  erse &amp; euer the archers ayded the horsemen. Whyle the horsemen
were thus skyrmishyng, the viii. score auenturers whiche were hardy &amp;
valiaunt men cast themselfes about &amp; came to basse Bullein, and there
they were hardely receiued of the Frenchmen, yet notwithstādyng they
lost their barriers and the Englishmen entred, there was shotyng on al
sides and a strong fight. The Frenchmen cried Bullein, and thenglishmen
sainct George Calayce: but at the last the Frenchmen were driuen
backe and many slaine, &amp; xliiii. taken prisoners, and so they returned to
their capitaine sir Willyam Fitzwillyam. All this while was Christopher
Coo on lond on the sea cost and bet ye Frenchmen vp to the toune,
and when the tide turned he with all his came againe in safetie to their
shippes. The Englishe horsemen after long fightyng tooke thre of the
Frenchemen of armes and the other reculed to the toune. By this
tyme by reason of the Alarme was all the countrey of Pycardye raysed
and muche people resorted to Bullein on all sydes, whiche doyng sir
Willyam Fitzwillyam wisely perceiuyng, by the sound of a trumpette
brought all his menne together in a plumpe, and then sent them hither
and thither to fette his driftes of beastes that were nere in the countrey
on euery side, whiche was quickely done, for the aduenturers brought
Oxen, Kyne, Horses, and many other pillages, and brent the granges

and villages, and so mette together, and with their botie returned in
sauetie.
               The tewesdaie folowyng, beyng the laste daie of Maie, sir Willyam
Fitz Willyam, with a .C. and fiftie horsemen, and the auenturers, and a
hundred other persones mo, came to a place called Samer de Boys, the
saied capitain wisely considered, that in that place the Frenchemen had
diuerse tymes lurked, and taken at auantage the Englishmen, wherfore
he laied his horsemen, and his archers on horsebacke in a woodde, in a
waite if the Frenchemen folowed the stale: then he sent furth the auenturers,
whiche passed farther then y• capitain would that thei should haue
doen, and sodainly thei were askried: then on came the Frenchemen, the
auenturers sware, that thei would not flee, but bent theimselfes to defēd
their enemies, whiche wer .iii.C. horsemen. The Frenchmen knewe well
their hardines, but yet thei called theim Crakers, whiche by missoundyng,
was commonly called Krekers, for a suretie these men wer hardy,
and full of pollicie, and very far
                     •
                  e would ieoperd, the Frenchemen sent
aboute a valey .i.C. of the best horsemen, and .ii.C. footemen, then wer
                     •
                  
the Krekers betwene twoo bendes of the Frenchmen: sir Willyam Fitz
Willyā, beyng assured of the conduite of the Frenchemen, muche doubted
the chaunce of the auenturers, wherefore in greate hast sent for his
stale of horsemen, that he had left couered: and the Frenchmen that wer
before the Krekers, came and set on very fast, in hope of their horsemen,
that wer gone about an hill in the valey. The Englishemen theim valiantly
defended, then as the horsemen had compassed the hill, the auenturers
wer come on a plain: then the horsemen that wer come to sir Williā
Fitz Willyam, set on the French horsemen, there was a hard and a ferce
encounter, for the Frenchmen fought sore, but at length thei fled, and in
the chace wer taken .lvi. horsmen, and .xliiii. slain one and other, &amp; many
Englishemen sore hurte and diuerse slain, thus the Krekers scaped a
narowe hasarde.
               In thesame season on the second daie of Maie, sir Thomas Palmer
one of the Capitaines of the frontiers, was ridyng to his frende, master
Ierome of Burgon, capitain of Turnahan, and with hym .xx. Englishe
men on light horse, and as he roade, he sodainly espied .xxx. horsemen, of
the garrison of Tirwyn and Bullein, thei were nere together or the Englishemen
espied theim: then there was no remedy, but to encounter, sir
Thomas Palmer wel comforted his compaignie, and then the Frenche
men set on with great force, and truly thei fought long, without one hauyng
any auauntage of the other, but at last the Frenchemen began to
faint, and alitle to withdrawe themselfes, that perceiuyng the Englishe
men, set to them coragiously, and so thei slewe three out of hande, and .vi
men of armes taken prisoners, and eight dimy lances, with whiche prisoners
the Englishemen returned to Guysnes, and kepte not their purpose
to Turnahan, for all were hurte or wounded.
               In Iune, sir Willyam Fitz Willyam, capitain of Guysnes, sir Ihon

Walop, and sir Ihon Gage, secretly called to them .ix.C. men of warre
suche as thei trusted, and on Midsomer day, passed the lowe countrey of
Picardy, vnto the castle of Hardynghā, or Rigsam and thei caried with
them but one pece of ordinaunce called a Curtall, this gonne thei bente
against the Castle, whiche was well furnished with harnes, ordinaunce,
and all other artilerie, and thynges nedefull, and the capitain also was
a valiant and hardie gentleman. The Englishemen euer shot that pece
and remoued it from place to place with greate pain, and in conclusion
made a batery of the walles, so that thei might assault it, then the trompet
blewe to assault, and the capitain with his compaignie stoode at defence:
then sir Ihon Wallop, and sir Ihon Gage with the auenturers
or krekers entred the diche, and the archers shot at euery loupe arrowes
and the Frenchemen likewise shot quarelles: the Englishmen set vp laders
to the walles, but the Frenchemen threwe thē doune, at this assault
was slain a gentleman called Butler, and .xv. other Englishmen, but for
all that, the assaulte was not lefte, for some clymed by pikes, and some amended
the ladders, and cried again to the assault: but sir William Fitz
William chief capitain of this enterprise, perceiued that thei lacked engynes
and other thynges, 
                     •
                  or the spedy assault of the castle, and not willyng
to lose his men without cause, caused them to staye, while he and other
capitaines counsailed together, and as thei were concluded once again
to attempt the assault, thei hard newes that twoo thousande horse
men, and twoo thousande footemen, wer at hande to fight with thē, thei
then perceiuyng that .ix.C. men beyng wery, wer no power to encounter
with foure thousande Frenchemen, thei in good ordre returned to the
Englishe fortresses.
               Monsire de Bees Capiiain of Bullein, well considered all the enterprices,
that the Englishmen had doen in Picardy and Fraunce, now of
late: he determined to requite theim, to his honor and fame, and for that
purpose, sent for the erle of Dammartyne, the lorde Pontremie, and the
lorde Chastillion, whiche concluded, to entre into the Englishe pale, and
to shewe themselfes before Calice. Wherefore thei assembled all the men
of armes and souldiers, of the garrisons aboute, and so thei wer .viii.C.
good horsemen, and with pikes, gonnes, and crossebowes .viii.C. footemen:
and when all this compaignie was assembled, Monsire de Bees as
capitain of this iorney, with the other lordes, the fourthe daie of August
with banner displaied, came toward Calice in the euenyng: and the next
daie in the mornyng by sixe of the Clocke, thei came to a village within
the Englishe pale, called Bonynges. Then the Alarme rose through all
the Englishe pale, and so came to Calice. These lordes of Fraunce sente
out their foreriders, to serche and ouer se the coūtrey, and then thei laied
an embushement of .iii.C. horsemen, at thesaid toune of Bonynges, and
with that bend abode Monsire Pontremie, and Monsire de Bees rode
to Kalkewell with .iiiC. horsemen, and there taried with them, the erle of
Dammartine with .iii.C. freshe horsemen, and all the footemen with bā
                  ner

displaied, roade and forraged all the Countrey, of whiche three hundred
speres, thei let one .C. go at large, and kept the residue with them.
               When the Alarme came to Calice, euery man made to horse and harnes.
Then sir Robert Iernyngham with .lxxx. horsemen with all spede,
rode out of Calice to behold the compaignie of the Frenchemen. And he
sent furth his light horsemen, whiche met with the skourers of the Frēch
men, and because the Frenchemen semed a fewe in nombre, the Englishe
for
                     •
                  riders profered toward them, whiche fled towarde Sandiffeld, and
the Englishemen chased after, not beeyng of knowlege of the 
                     •
                  mbushementes,
that laye at Bonynges and Kalkewell.
               When sir Robert Iernyngham sawe his light horsemen chace, he folowed
after softly, to kepe his horse in brethe. Then sodainly the French
men that were in chace returned, for some of their aide was nere theim.
When the Englishemen whiche passed not .xvi. horse, sawe the Frenchemen
returne, thei encountered with theim manfully, but to the Frenchemen
came still mo and mo, so that the Englishemen were constrained to
flie another waie, to the hye lande in greate ieoperdy, for the Frenchmen
them pursued, but by the helpe of the light geldynges, the Englishemen
gat the sea side, or sea sandes beyond Skales: then wer the Englishmen
glad and returned, and fought with the Frenchmen hande to hande, for
the Frenchemen behynde folowed not the chace, but onely twentie horse
men, and with pure fightyng the Englishemen toke one of the Frenche
horsemen, and came with hym to Calice, and so wer saued.
               When sir Robert Iernyngham sawe his men in chace (as you haue
hard) and sawe that thei wer in great ieoperdy, he auaunsed for their rescue
all that he might, whiche was the sauyng of the light horsemen, for
the Frenhemen lefte theim, to encounter with sir Robert Iernyngham,
and so it was that he went so farre forward, that the Frenchemen were
betwene hym and Calice. And when he sawe al the bendes, and embushmentes
breake out, he said to his compaignie: sers, sainct George to borowe,
lette these Frenche galantes knowe what wee Englishemen bee:
Sir saied his compaignie, thei shall bye vs dere. Then he marched towarde
the high lande: Then approched a greate nombre of horsemen
of Fraunce, the Englishemen theim valiauntly receiued, and manfully
defended, but euer the Frēchmen came freshe and freshe, so that the Englishemen
beyng wery, and oppressed with multitude, were faine to flie:
and in this chace was taken Thomas Cheiney an Archer, whose horse
was tiered, and two other archers on horsbacke, one called George Kar
and the other Rowlande Atkynson, and thre other of the Englishe pale,
sir Robert and the remnaunt, saued themselfes the best that thei could.
               When sir Robert was returned, the Frenchemen souned their trompet,
and re
                     •
                  uled to Bullein, and sent woorde to Calice, that thei would
visite thē oftener. Sir Robert Iernyngham remembryng this chaunce,
thought to be reuenged of thesame, &amp; so aduisyng hymself, to what place
he should repare, he remembred that whensoeuer the Englishmen made

any iorney to Margyson, the Frenchemen would flie ouer the water or
creke▪ to a high ground by boates, and there as it wer in an island, saue
thēselfes, because on that side thei might euer haue succors, for the creke
or water, is beyond the toune from Calice. Therfore thesaied sir Robert
caused fiue greate boates to bee caried in wagons, and so he with other
capitaines, of Calice and Guysnes, to the nombre of .iii.C. fotemen with
the Krekers▪ &amp; .lx. horsemen the .xii. daie of August, with banners displayed,
toke their waie to the toune of Margison, and in the night the light
horsemen gaue Alarme to the toune of Bullein, and toke two souldiers
prisoners, and brought with theim certain cattaill to their compaignie.
Then thenglishemen marched forward, toward Margyson, that seyng
the Frenchemen, toke their boates in trust of the water, and passed ouer,
the Englishemen perceiued that, and lanched their Boates, and so like
auenturers entered, and by force passed▪ and so mo and mo, till .C.lx. wer
passed ouer: the countrey began to gather, so that the Frenchemen were
thre hundred, whiche fought with the Englishmen, and would haue letted
the boates to land, but the archers on the other side draue thē backe,
and the Englishemen slewe at the first encounter .lx. men, and toke fortie
prisoners, yet the Frenchemen that fled met with newe succors, and then
began a newe battail, and the Frenchmen fought hardely, but at thende
thei fled, the moste porest of the people, on the other side of the water, fled
to the Churche, and abode at their defence, then was there fire set in the
church, then the Frenchemen lept out of the churche, to their destruccion,
for of three hundred there was saued but sixtie on liue.
               The whole power of Bullein was come doune, nere to the place: but
when thei perceiued that it was to late, and that the Englishemen were
returned thei came no farther. This was sir Robert Iarnyngham euen
with the Frenchemen, and brought a good botie, and many prisoners to
Calice, whiche sore greued the capitain of Bullein.
               The Frenchemen perceiuyng, that thei gat litle at the Englishemennes
handes, thought to take their auauntage of the Flemmynges, wher
fore thei assembled of the garrisons, of Bullein and Tirwyn, v.C. fotemen,
and three hundred horsemen, and so in good ordre marched toward
sainct Omers, and thei sent to go aforragyng .i.C. footmen, and as many
horsemen, and the rest kepte themselfes in a stale. These Frenchemen
came by Arkus, nigh to sainct Omers, and forraged al the countrey, the
Alarme sprang all the countrey to Turnahan, the capitain of Turnahā
sent woorde to sir Willyam Fitzwillyan, Capitain of Guysnes, that the
Frenchemen were abrode, whiche made answere, that if the Frenchemen
came nere to hym, surely he would speke with them, with whiche answer
the capitain of Turnahan beyng encoraged, sent furth .CC. Flēmynges
on foote, stil the Frenchemen marched toward Turnahā, the Flemmynges
that wer sent from Turnahan, marched toward the waie, where the
Frenchemen should come, thynkyng that when the capitain of Guysnes
had set on them, that then thei would haue lien in the chace at the receipt
               
                  
Thesaied capitain of Guisnes valiantly marched forward, with a .C
horsemen, and .iiii.C. footemen, entendyng to mete with the Frenchmen,
and sodainly as he was passyng forward, worde was brought hym that
the erle of Damarten, with the garrisons of Mustrel and Abuile, to the
nomber of .vi.C. horsemen, were commyng forward towarde Guysnes.
This hearyng sir Willyam Fitzwillyam, sware that the erle should not
take pain to come to Guisnes, for he would mete him on the way: by this
meane he left his first enterprice, &amp; marched toward therle of Damartin
               The Frenchemen of Tirwyn, beyng therof aduertised by a spy, called
all the people together, and with their botie came on forwarde towarde
Turnahan, and sodainly thei askried the poore Flemynges, whiche wer
sent out of the castle of Turnahan, and when thei perceiued the French
men, commyng toward thē, thei turned their backes, and fled like shepe:
the Frenchemen folowed apace, and slewe the moste parte of theim, for
fewe escaped.
               The capitain of Guysnes came to a faire grene, fiue myle from Guisnes,
and there in good ordre of battaill, taried for the Erles commyng,
whiche hearyng that the capitain of Guysnes, was redy to receiue hym,
made his returne backeward, without any thyng doyng: when the capitain
knewe the truthe of the erles returne, he then with all hast, sped hym
to mete with the Frenchemen, that were commyng to Turnahan, and in
the meane waie, he hard tidynges of the chaunce of the Flemynges, and
how the Frenchmen wer re
                     •
                  uled toward Tirwyn, whiche auenture sore
hym displeased, but there was no remedy, wherfore he returned to Guisnes
again, very sory that the Frenchemen, went awaie vnfought withall:
The Frenchemen litle medled after this tyme, wherefore let vs now
returne, and shewe what warres wer kept on the frontiers, betwene Englande
and Scotlande, in this ceason.
               The .xxi. daie of Maie beyng Trinite Sondaie, v.C. Scottes in the
mornyng by seuerall fordes, entered into Englande, and laye couertly
by the high waie, to distresse merchauntes and merket men, that should
passe to Berwike, that daie to the faire: for euery Trinite Sondaie, ther
is kepte a greate faire, whiche the Scottes knewe well, and as thei laye
thus lurkyng, thei robbed many merchauntes, and toke riche prisoners,
but at the last thei wer perceiued, then the Alarme rose, and people begā
to gather, the Scottes drewe together toward Branxston, &amp; thenglishmen
theim assailed, whiche so manfully theim defended, that if the yong
lorde of Fulbery, had not come with one .C. light horsmen, the Scottes
had gone awaie with their botie, but then began a sore fight, many were
hurt on bothe sides, and some slain, and at the last the Scottes fled, and
in the chace there were twoo hundred Scottes taken prisoners, and the
residue fled and saued themselfes.
               After this the .v. daie of Iuly, sir Ihon a Fenwicke, Leonard Musgraue,
and bastard Heron, and diuerse other, gathered together .ix.C. mē
and entred into Scotland, in the countrey called the Marche, &amp; robbed

and spoyled all the countrey, and by chaunce thesame season, the Scottes
had assembled twoo thousande men, to inuade Englande, and none
of these knewe of other, till thei by auenture met together. Then began
a strong medley, for the Scottes fought valiauntly a greate while, and
the Englishemen them hardeli assailed, and at the last by fine force, caused
theim to leaue the grounde and flie, and in the flight wer taken .CC.
Scottes, and many slain, of the whiche prisoners diuerse wer gentlemē
sir Raufe of Fanwicke, Leonard Musgraue, and bastarde Heron, with
xxx. other Englishemen wel horssed, folowed so farre the chace, that thei
were paste rescues of their compaignie, whiche perceiuyng the Scottes
sodainly returned, and sette on the Englishemen, whiche oppressed with
multitude, were sone ouercome, and there was taken sir Raufe a Fanwicke,
Leonard Musgraue, and sixe other, and bastarde Heron, and seuen
other slain, the remnant by chaunce eskaped: the other Englishmen
with their twoo hundred prysoners, returned sauely into Englande: the
slaying of the Bastard Heron, was more pleasure to the Scottes, then
the takyng of the two hundred was displeasure, thei hated hym so.
               The .vii. daie of Iuly, the lorde Maxwell of Scotlande, and sir Alexander
Iorden, with banners displayed, and Scottes to the nombre of
foure thousande, entered into Englande at the West Marches by Carleile,
and began to burne on euery side: then the Englishemen assembled
on euery side, and so thei were in nombre .ii.M. men, and fiercely set on
the Scottes, there was a greate fighte, for the space of an houre, at the
last the Englishemen brake the arraie of the Scottes, and them discomfited,
and toke .CCC. Scottes prisoners, the Englishemen that had taken
prisoners, went awaie with their prisoners: For sir Alexander Iorden
and his sonne and diuerse other were taken prisoners, and by their
departyng, the compaignie of the Englishemen was muche minished.
The lorde Maxwell beyng a politique man, perceiued that, &amp; sodainly
called his people together, and them encoraged, and began a newe skirmishe,
and recouered al the prisoners almost, and toke diuerse Englishe
men prisoners, this was the chaunce of warre.
               After this iorney, in the Courte of Parliament of Scotlande, was
muche commonyng of the warres, whiche were betwene Englande and
Scotlande: some of the nobles saied, that Fraunce neuer did so muche
good to Scotlande in .xx. yeres, as Scotlande had lost by Englande,
ī one yere, for y• loue &amp; cause of Fraūce: wherfore they thought it cōueniētto
make a perpetuall league of amitie, with y• kyng of Englande, and
to leaue the Frenche kynges parte. Other nobles whiche had pencions
in Fraunce, declared the olde amitie betwene Fraunce and Scotlande,
and how the Frenche kyng, brought vp many gentlemen of Scotlande
in his Courte, geuyng theim greate liuynges, whiche the kyng of Englande
would not do: thei also alleged the franches, and priuileges that
the Scottes haue in Fraūce, and specially thei shewed, that if the kyng
of Scottes should breake with Fraunce, &amp; then if it happened the kyng

of Englande, to inuade Scotlande, whiche beeyng without aide of any
frend, might well by the power of Englande be conquered. After many
long reasons it was thought expedient, to sue to the kyng of Englande
for a truce, whiche was doen, &amp; a truce graunted til. S. Andrewes daie.
               This yere the first day of September, was docter Thomas Hanibal
Master of the Rolles, receiued into London, with erles, and bishoppes,
and diuerse other nobles and gentlemen,A Rose brought from Rome. as Ambassador from Clement
bishop of Rome, whiche brought with hym a rose of gold, for a token to
the kyng: the people as he passed▪ thought to haue seen the Rose, but it
was not shewed, till he came to the kyng to Wynsore, on the daie of the
Natiuitie of our Lady, on whiche daie, after a solempne Masse song by
the Cardinall of Yorke, thesaid present was deliuered to the kyng, whiche
was a tree forged of fine golde, and wrought with branches, leaues
and flowers, resemblyng Roses: this tree was set in a pot of gold, which
pot had thre fete of antike fashion: the pot was of measure halfe a pinte,
in the vppermost Rose, was a faire Saphier loupe perced, the bignes of
an Acorne, the tree was of height halfe an Englishe yard, and in bredth
it was a foote. Thesaied Ambassador in deliueryng thesame rose, made
an oracion, declaryng the good mynd, loue, and fauor, that the bishop of
Rome bare to the kyng, in token whereof he sent hym that present, whiche
the kyng thankefully receiued, and deliuered it to hym again, and so
he bare it open before the kyng, from the College to the greate chamber,
and there deliuered it to the Master of the Iuell house, and so there ended
his Legacion.
               Befor this tyme in the moneth of Iuly, Lorde Archebalde Douglas
erle of Anguishe, whiche had maried the Quene of Scottes, sister to the
kyng of Englande, and was sent into Fraunce by the Duke of Albany,
and there kepte, contrary to his will and pleasure, and from thence hardely
escaped, and came to the kyng of England, to his maner of Grenewiche,
and there besought hym of his aide &amp; comfort, to whom the kyng
made a gentle answere. This Erle was not in the fauor of his wife the
Quene of Scottes, wherefore she caused hym to bee sent into Fraunce:
some saied that she loued the duke of Albany, better then hym, but what
soeuer the matter was, she wrote to the Frenche kyng, that if therle euer
came again into Scotlande, that the Frenche kyng should haue no plesure
in Scotlande, that she might let, so that the erle beyng in Fraunce,
was in ieoperdie of his life. Wherfore secretly he fled and came into Englande,
as you haue hard, and one daie at the Castle of Wynsore he declared,
that in the counsaill of Fraunce, when he was there, thei happened
in communicacion, to talke of y• warres that were then, betwene the
Emperor and the Frenche king, and betwene the kyng of England and
the Frenche kyng: there was a Lorde of the counsaill, that stode vp and
saied, it were better that one persone suffered, rather then all the Realme
should bee daily in this mischief. Then was it asked, what he meante by
that one persone, he answered, that if the Frenche Quene, whiche was

lame and vgly were dedde, that then waies might bee founde, that the
Frenche kyng should mary themperors sister, and to haue with her the
Duchy of Millain, and then with the money of her mariage, the kyng of
England should be paied, and so a peace might be concluded: to this no
answere was made, but whether this were true or false, for a truthe the
Frēche quene was ded the .xxvi. daie of Iuly, &amp; was buried at .s. De
                     •
                  ise
               The duke of Burbon this Sommer, made sharpe warre on the Frē
                  che
kynges dominions, and did high enterprises: wherefore the kyng of
Englande sent his letters, to diuerse lordes and gentlemen in this seasō
the tenor whereof ensueth. Trustie. &amp;c. For asmuche as (our Lorde God
be thanked) our armie, vnder the leadyng of our cosyn the duke of Burbon,
hath not onely entered the realme of Fraunce, gainyng and attaynyng
many tounes, citees, Castles, and places, with the whole countrey
of Prouince, without any resistence, of our auncient enemie the Frenche
kyng, but also goeth daily marchyng, and continually dooth chace, and
driue before them suche men of warre, as our said enemie hath prepared
for his defence, in resistence of our cosyn the Duke of Burbon, and oure
saied armie. In suche wise that it is thought vndoubtedly, now to bee
moste conuenient tyme and season, either in our persone (although the
yere be somewhat past) or by a leuetenaunt, with a puissant armie to inuade
Fraunce, on the other side, bothe for the recoueryng of the Croune
and to compell our saied enemie, to knowlege his obstinate, wilfull, and
cronious demeanure, wherfore we will and commaunde you, to be redy
with suche power as you be able to make, vpon the next Proclamacion
to be made, dated the tenth daie of September.
               After whiche letters sent furthe, euery man made preparacion accordyngly,
and the people murmured and saied, that it were muche better,
that the kyng should maintein his warres, with his awne subiectes, and
spende his treasure on them, then to trust the Duke of Burbon, beyng a
straungier to spende his money.
               The kyng beyng at Wynsore, to hym came sir Anthony Fitz Herbert
one of the Iustices of the Cōmon place, a man of excellent lernyng in the
lawe, as appereth by his workes, sir Raufe Egerton knight, doctor Dē
                  ton
Deane of Lichfeld, which in the beginnyng of this yere, wer sent as
Commissioners into Irelande, whiche so wisely endeuored theimselfes,
that thei reformed many iniuries doen in the countrey, and brought diuerse
of the wilde Irishe, by faire meanes to a submission, and made by
the Kynges aucthoritie, the Erle of Kildare deputie of the lande, before
whom the greate Oneele bare the sworde: and the Lorde Piers Butler,
called Erle of Ormound, whiche was deputie of Irelande, was by thesaied
Commissioners, made high threasorer of Irelande. And when thei
had set all thynges in good ordre, in the moneth of September thei toke
shippyng, and in thesame monethe came to the kyng, whiche gaue theim
his hartie thankes, for their good doynges.
               In this monethe the kyng sent Master Ihon Magnus Priest, and

Roger Ratcliffe Esquier into Scotlande, for the suretie of his nephew
the kyng of Scottes, for diuerse lordes of Scotland, wrote to the kyng
that thei doubted the suretie of their kyng, because the duke of Albany,
whiche was heire apparant to the realme of Scotlande, had the kyng in
gouernaunce, &amp; also thei thought, he beyng a Frencheman borne, should
not rule their realme: wherefore thei emongest thēselfes, murmured sore
in this matter. The Duke hearyng, that the Lordes of Scotlande, had
written to the kyng of Englande, and also that thei repined and grudged
at his doynges, sodainly with all the threasure that he could make,
departed from Scotlande, and sailed into Fraunce, with whiche departyng
the commons were nothyng sory, and sone after his departyng, the
Ambassador of Englande, were ioyously receiued into Scotlande, and
there thesaied Ambassadors taried, till Marche twelue monethe▪ in whiche
tyme, there wer many conclusions driuen, betwene the two realmes:
now let vs returne to Fraunce.
               The .xxiiii. daie of September, thre horsemen of the garrison of Bullein,
whiche wel knewe the hauen of Calice, came at a nepe tide, and passed
ouer Calice hauen, by Rise banke in the night, and went behynd the
Est Wyndmill, and then tooke lande, and went to a litle village called
Middilwaie, and passed the Turne Pikes, and entered into a Whelers
house, and tooke the man and the wife, and .xx.l. in money sterlyng, and
went a waie clere without askrie of perceiuyng of the watche of Calice,
and no manne wist where thei were become, till the Trompet of Bullein
brought worde, and demaunded the ransome.
               The laste daie of September, fiftie light horsemen of Calice, apperteignyng
to sir Rober Iernyngham, rode towarde Bullein, and passed
the water of Margysō, and came to the water of Sclakes nere Bullein
where sodainly thei encountered .lx. Frenchmen, of the garrison of Bullein,
there was shotyng with long bowes and crosebowes, on euery side
strong was the fight, but at the last the Frenchemen fled, the Englishemen
folowed, and toke thre light horsemen, and when thei perceiued the
Alarme on euery side, thei put themselfes in arraie, and with their botie
came to Calice.
               Thesame daie sir Thomas Palmer, with .lx. horsemen of Guysnes,
encountered with the capitain Bertram, leader of the horsemen of therle
Dammartyn, with .lx. horsemen, there was a strong fight twoo howers
together, but in the ende the Frenchemen fled, and the Englishemen folowed,
and toke .xviii. prisoners, and .xvi. good horse, and with this bot
                     •
                  e
thei returned to Guysnes.
               In this busie season, the auenturers hearyng what the horsemen, on
their parties had doen▪ and inespeciall perceiuyng that thenglishe horsemen
had taken good prisoners, commoned emongest theimselfes, what
was to be doen, then one of their capitaines said openly: sirs you se how
long wee haue been here, and wages we haue none, our liuyng riseth on
the gain of our enemies, and sithe our beginnyng, wee haue had good

chaunce in all our enterprises, God bee thanked: now the Wynter draweth
nere, let vs now auenture to get some good botie▪ to make vs mery
with, in the cold wether, and if you will, we shall enterprise a thyng, that
I truste to vs shalbee profitable. Then all the compaignie cried turthe
turth. Then with a banner of sainct George, thei marched toward a village,
liyng toward Mustrell, hauyng onely .xxv. light horsemen, to bee
their skou
                     •
                  e
                     •
                  s, and thei wer not fully two hundred men. This compaignie
folowyng their skourers, went farre on, and had gotten a faire botie,
of Oxen, Kyne, and other beastiall, and wer nere at their returne, and
by chaunce thesame daie, was the erle of Dammartyn, and the capitain
of Mustrell, with the power of the Duke of Uandosme, goyng toward
sainct Omers, to burne and destroy that countrey, and for that purpose
thei had gathered together .xv.C. horsmen, and .viii.C. footmen, howbeit
the footemen wer a large mile behynd the horsemen.
               The Frenchmen on horsebacke, espied the Englishe horsmen, whiche
perceiuyng the greate nombre fled, and as thesaid Frenchmen marched
forward, thei espied the auenturers on foote, &amp; made toward them: thenglishemen
seyng the greate nombre of the horsemen, studied to get some
hedge, or strong place to fortifie theim, but there was no suche place in
sight, and also thei had no suche tyme so to doo, wherefore the Capitain
saied: Good felowes and brethren, wee haue of long tyme been called auenturers,
now is the tyme come of our auenture, the Frenchemen will
not raūsome vs for nothyng, we be emongest thē so feared: if any thyng
saue our liues, it must be God and our hardines, and therefore saied he,
if you se me begyn to flie, slaie me out of hande. Then euery manne cried
God mercie, and kneled donne and kissed the yearth, and strake handes
eche with other, in token not to departe, and then made theimselfes prest
to the defence.
               The Frenchmen came on, on euery side, thenglishmen shot their arrowes,
and defended them aswel as thei could: the Frenchmen perceiuyng
that the Englishemen, kept thēselfes so close, caused diuerse of the horse
men to light a fote, and so thei did, and fought with their speres against
the pikes, and shotte with Crosebowes on euery side. Alas the while, for
while the Englishemen had arrowes to shote, thei were not broken, but
close without perill, but when their arrowes wer spent, the Englishmen
fought valiauntly, and slewe many Frenchemen that lighted on foote,
but in the conclusion the horsemen entered, and killed them al in maner
because there were so many of their compaignie s
                     •
                  ain, and tooke fewe of
them prisoners.The ende of the auēturers This was thend of these compaignions, called the krekers
or auenturers, whiche wer as hardie men, as euer serued prince or
capitain.
               The Duke of Burbon, with the Marques of Picardy, in the moneth
of October, with a greate puyssaunce, laied siege to the strong toune of
Marcell in Prouince, and laye there a greate space. The Frenche kyng
reised a greate armie, and sware that he would reise the siege, whereof

hearyng the Duke of Burbon, sent for the Marques of Piscare, and
his other capitains, and declared to them that his intēt was, to geue the
Frenche Kyng battaill: the Marques of Piscare saied that the Frenche
kynges puyssaunce was greate, and theirs small, and said: although the
duke of Burbon, whiche was a banished man from his countrey, had no
other remeady to reuenge hym, but by battaill, yet he saied he would not
put al the Emperors men, of the whiche he had the guyde, in suche a hasard
till the remnant of the Emperours power wer come. Well saied the
duke of Burbon, then you do not as you haue written, bothe to the Emperor
and to the kyng of England, whiche shalbe a reproche to your honor:
Naie saied the Marques, I will kepe me from reproche. Then said
docter Richard Pace, Ambassador for the kyng of Englande: my lorde
you haue had the Kyng my Masters wages, I would bee glad to heare
what waie you would take: I woll tell you said the Marques, the Frēch
kyng hath a great armie gone into Italy, &amp; he hymself foloweth with another,
not to come to fight with vs. I dare assure you: but onely to take
the Duchie of Millain vnprouided, whiche shall do hym more pleasure
then he had slain all vs. Also the Emperor shall lese, more then .x. Marceles
be worthe, and the Frenche kynges power shalbe more elated, that
he will not set by the Emperor, nor the kyng of Englande. Therfore my
aduise is, to breake vp this siege, and with all spede to preuēt hym in Italy,
and if we bee entered the tounes, and put municions in thesame, he
shall lye a colde in the feldes, and then you shall se what shall become of
hym, when his beastes dye, and his vitaill spent. To this counsaill the
duke and all the Capitaines agreed, and so brake vp the siege, and with
all hast departed into Italy, and fortified all the tounes in the Duchie
of Millain, with men and other necessaries.
               The Frenche kyng hearyng of this, with all his armie passed the
Mountaignes, and Camped nere to Millain. It chaunced in this monethe
of Nouember the .xiii. daie, aboute the toune of Calice, there fell a
great mist, in whiche mist the Frenchmen came to a village called Kause
beside Newnā bridge, &amp; tooke .xl. beastes, then the Alarme was brought
to Calice, whiche hearyng the Marshall of Calice, called to hym sir Robert
Iernyngham, and thei had with them .i.C.xx. horsemen, and sent sir
Anthony Broune to tell the capitain of Guysnes, what thei intended to
do, but thei 
                     •
                  aried not for the compaignie of Guynes, but marched so far
forward, that thei came to the water of Sclaukes, whiche is nere Bullein,
and there thei sette their stale. And in the mornyng betyme, thei sent
furth a gentleman called Richard Lamberd, with .xx. light horsemen on
swifte geldynges, and thei came by Moone light nere Bullein, and then
thei sawe the men of Bullein and other there about, put out there be
                     •
                  tes
into the feld. Then the Englishemen with greate diligence, brought all
the beastes together, and so began to driue theim together, toward their
embushement. Then the Alarme began at Bullein, and the men of warr
issued out of the toune, and fought with thenglishemen, their horses wer

freshe: wherfore thei had a great auantage, but incōclusion three French
menne were slain, and their horses taken, and so the light horsemen came
with their cattaill, nere to the embushement, and the Frenchemen folowed,
that seyng the Englishemen that kept the stale, came in all hast and
rescued their light horsemen, and draue the Frenchemen backe, and then
made returne with their beastes, and as thei were returnyng, thei had
worde brought to them, how that sir Willyam Fitzwillyam, capitain of
Guysnes with his retinue, were besiegyng a pile called the castle of Capell,
wherfore thei sped them thether in all hast, and when thei wer come
thether, the capitain of Guysnes theim hartely welcomed, and then thei
concluded to geue an assault to the Castle, and so with good courage set
on, the Frenchemen defended it very valiantly a greate while, but at the
laste the Englishmen gat ouer the diches, and scaled the walles, but the
Frenchemen still them defended, till the Englishemen had gotten to the
highest of the dongion, and then was there slaiyng a pace▪ For there wer
liii. persones slain out of hande, in reuengyng the greate obstinacie of
the Frenchemen, and the castle was rased and brent. Then sir Willyam
Fitzwillyam with his botie, and sir Ihon Wallop Marshall of Calice
and sir Ihon Iernyngham returned, he to Guysnes, and thei to Calice.
Thesame daie .xiiii. Burgonions, and .xiiii. Spaniardes, all horsemen
of Guysnes, came to the Churche of Falske, not farre from Durnam at
high Masse tyme, and there drewe their swordes, and so muche did, that
all the men in the churche, to the nomber of fiftie, yelded theimselfes prisoners,
of the whiche nomber thei toke eight persones with them, whiche
should be gages for the remnant, &amp; with these .viii. thei came to Guisnes
               The .xix. daie of December wer receiued into London, lorde Gilbert
Keuet Erle of Castelles, sir Robert Cockeburne bishop of Dunkel, and
the Abbot of Campskenell, Ambassadors from Iames the fifth kyng of
Scottes, by the bishop of Lyncolne, the lorde of sainct Ihones, and diuerse
other noble men, and wer conueighed to their lodgynges at Taylers
Haule.
               The .xxiii. daie of December, thesaied Ambassadors wer conueighed
to Grenewiche, accompaignied with thesaied lordes by water, a
                     •
                  d when
thei came to the vtter gate, thei wer receiued of the officers of the house,
and so passed through the haule, which was well furnished with people,
and so through the vttermost chamber, into the greate chamber of presence,
where thei wer receiued and welcomed, of al the prīces and nobles
of the realme, and within a short space the kyng came furth, and set hym
self in a throne of three steppes high, vnder his Clothe of estate, whiche
was veri rich, but his apparell was excedīg riche, both of goldsmithes
worke &amp; perle, and stone, which the Scottes wel auised, &amp; then thei wisely
and humbly made their obeisance, and the bishop in good plain latin
made a solempne Oracion, in the whiche he declared, that although the
realme of Scotland and he, had often times hard the renoune and fame
of hym and his Courte, bothe for the giftes of grace and nature, whiche

wer in his persone, yet he saied that his princely countenance, his louely
fauor, whiche he hymself did se, did muche surmount the fame &amp; name,
whiche he hath hard of reporte. He declared further, that although fortune
had hym fauored, in conqueryng of regions, and vanquishyng of
battailes, yet that thyng was not so honorable to hym, nor profitable to
his realme, as was a good peace, whiche pleaseth bothe God and man,
and for that cause he shewed, that kyng Iames the fifth his nephew, and
felowe to the kyng of Englande, had sent them his Ambassadors, to entreate
a peace, so that a cōuenient mariage might be made, betwene hym
and the lady Mary, daughter to the kyng, whiche should be a lincke necessary,
to knit together the realme of Scotlande and England, in perpetuall
loue and amitie.
               To whiche Oracion, the bishop of London docter Tunstal answered
and saied: that the kyng was at their desire, content to haue peace vpon
reasonable condicions, and as touchy
                     •
                  g mariage of his daughter, he
would so answere theim, that thei should bee contented. Then the kyng
rose from his place and welcomed theim, and all the honest persones of
the train, and after communicacion had, thei tooke their leaue for that
tyme, and so toke their barge and came to London.
               Before the feast of Christmas, the lorde Leonard Grey, and the lorde
Ihon Grey, brethrē to the Marques Dorcet, sir George Cobham sonne
to the lorde Cobham, Willyam Cary, sir Ihon Dudley, Thomas Wiat,
Frances Pointz, Frances Sidney, sir Anthony Broune, sir Edward
Seimour, Oliuer Manners, Perciuall Harte, Sebastian Nudigate,
and Thomas Calen Esquires of the Kynges housholde, enterprised a
chalenge of feactes of armes, against the feast of Christmas, wherefore
thei sent Wyndsore herault, on sainct Th
                     •
                  mas daie before Christmas,
into the Quenes great chamber, the kyng beyng present, whiche herault
had a coate of armes of red silke, beaten with a goodly Castle, of foure
Turrettes siluer, and in euery turret a faire lady, standyng gorgiously
appareled: the herault after that the Trumpet had blowen, saied, where
the kyng our souereigne Lorde, of his bountifull goodnes, hath geuen
to foure maidens of his Court, the castle of Loyaltie, to dispose at their
pleasure, thesaied maidens haue geuen the custodie therof, to a capitain
and fiftene gentlemen with hym, whiche capitain sent furthe me his Herault
called Chasteau Blanche, to declare to all kynges and princes, and other
gentlemen of noble corage, that thesaied capitain will nere to his Castle

                     •
                  aise a Mount, on whiche shall stande an Unicorne, supportyng foure
faire shildes.
               The firste shilde shalbe White, and whosoeuer toucheth that shelde
shalbe answered sixe courses at the Tilt, by them of the Castle, with hostyng
harnes and double peces.
               The second shilde, Red, betokenyng the Turnay, and whosoeuer toucheth
that shild, shalbe answered tenne strokes at the Turnay, with the
sworde, edge and poynt abated.
               
                  
The third shild yelow, signifiyng the Barriers, and he that toucheth
that shilde shalbee answered twelue strokes at the Barriers, with the
sworde, edge and poynt abated.
               The fourth shilde blewe, betokenyng the assaulte, with suche wepons
as the capitain of the Castle shal occupie, that is, Morrice pike, sworde,
target, the poynt and edge abated.
               Also thesaied capitain and his compaignie promise, to defend thesaid
Castle against all commers, beeyng gentlemen of name and armes, and
the assaulters to deuise, all maner of engynes for the assaultyng, edge
tole to breake the house and ground, onely except, and also that no other
weapon shalbe vsed, but suche as the patron shalbe sette vp, by thesaied
Unicorne, and that no manne medle with fire within or without, but the
matches for gonnes, and euery prisoner taken on either partie, to paye
for his raunsom .iiii yardes of right satten, &amp; euery capitain .xiii▪ yardes.
               Accordyng to this Proclamacion was the Mounte, and all thynges
deuised sumpteously, with a greate craggy braunche, on whiche wer hā
                  ged
the shildes of the armes of the capitain, and all other of the Castle.
For this enterprise there was set vp, in the Tilte yard at Grenewiche a
castle square euery waie .xx. foote, and fiftie foote on heigh, very strong
and of great timber, well fastened with yron, the embatelinentes, loupes
and euery place where men should entre, wer set with greate rolles, and
turned assone as thei wer touched, so that to semyng no man could entre
the towers, nor embatilmentes. On the North and Southe sides, were
twoo greate diches .xv. foote depe, from the brynke to the botome, &amp; thei
were very stepe, and betwene the diche and Castle, was set a pale, whiche
was rampaired with yearth so stepe and thicke, that it was not likely to
be gotten. On these diches were twoo drawe bridges, on the Weste side
was a greate rampire or banke, very stepe without and within, and like
to a vamure of a fortresse, by the vamure the diches wer .xxiiii. fote depe
When the strength of this castle was wel beholden, many made dangerous
to assault it, and some saied it could not be wonne by sporte, but by
ernest. The kyng mynded to haue it assaulted, and deuised engins therfore,
but the Carpenters wer so dull, that thei vnderstode not his intent,
and wrought all thyng contrary, and so for that tyme the assaulte was
prolonged, and all the other poyntes of the chalenge held, for the morow
after sainct Ihon the Euangelistes daie in Christmas, came out of the
castle▪ sixe men of armes of the castle, on horsebacke armed at al poyntes
with their speres ready to discharge, and so came to the ende of the Tilt,
abidyng all commers. Then sodainly entered into the feld, twoo ladies
on twoo palfreis, in greate robes of purple damaske, leadyng two ancient
knightes, with beardes of siluer, in thesame apparell, and when thei
came before the Quene, thei put vp a bill to her, the effect whereof was,
that although youth had lefte them, and age was come, and would lette
theim to doo feactes of armes: Yet courage, desire, and good will abode
with theim, and bad theim to take vpon theim to breake speres, whiche

thei would gladly doo, if it pleased her to geue theim license. When the
Quene and the Ladies had seen the bill, thei praised their corage, and
gaue them license.
               Then the knightes threw awaie their robes, and then it was knowen
that it was the Kyng, and the Duke of Suffolk, whose bardes and bases
were golde, embraudered with purple, siluer, and Blacke, very curiously.
After them folowed the Erle of Deuonshire, the Lorde Montacute,
the Lorde Roos, sir Nicholas Carewe, sir Frances Brian, Henry
Norreis, Anthony Kneuet, and fiue other, euery man ran eight courses,
in whiche courses the kyng brake seuen speres. Euery man that day did
well, so that the Scottes muche preised the men of armes of Englande▪
but moste of all thei preised and marueiled at the kynges strength, for
thei saw his speres wer brokē with more force, then the other speres wer
               When all the courses wer roune, the kyng and all the other disarmed
them, and went to supper, and after supper the kyng hauyng with hym,
the Ambassadors of Scotlande, came into the Quenes chamber, where
after that the Lordes, and diuerse Ladies had daunced, there came in a
Maske of .xvi. all appareled in clothe of Golde, riche tynsell and crimosyn
veluet, cut, slit, and tied very curiously, their buskins and shoen wer
golde, cappes and whoddes all gold, riche and not counterfeted: of this
nomber the Kyng and the Duke of Suffolke wer twoo, then the Ma

toke ladies, &amp; daunsed a greate season, and that doen was brought
in wyne and spices, and the straungiers well cherished, &amp; after that conueighed
toward their lodgyng. And as thei went thei asked a gentlemā
whiche accompaignied them, if all the warre tyme the kyng and the lordes
wer so mery, or had had suche ioyous pastyme, or kepte suche royall
housholde, or were so well appareled: for in their countrey thei saied, in
tyme of warre, was nothyng but wailyng and mournyng, and also thei
thought that the realme of Fraunce, is not a realme to sport with, nor to
Maske with. The gentleman answered, that the kyng and his courte, vsed
theim still all the warre tyme, as thei dooe now, for thei set not by the
Frenche kyng one bene. For the kyng of England maie sit in his chaire
and dammage the Frenche kyng, for the Lordes and cominaltie of England,
praie for the continuance of warre, for by the warres of Fraunce
thei wynne, and lese not, at whiche saiyng the Scottes muche mused.
               Fridaie the .xxx. daie of December, therle of Castels one of the Scottishe
Ambassadors toke his leaue, and departed toward Scotlande: for
to common with the Counsaill of Scotlande, for thynges whiche were
not in their commission, and left behynd hym the Bishoppe of Dunkell,
and the Abbot of Campskenell: some saied tharticle was, that the Scottes
should forsake the Frenche kyng, &amp; that the kyng of Scottes should
come into Englande, but whatsoeuer it was, euery man knewe it not.
               The second daie of Ianuary, there was muche talkyng of the assault
of the Castle, and so after long debate, sir Frances Brian, and Frances
Poynt;, enterprised to defende the Weste braie of the Castle, with Pike

George Harbert, Ihon Poyntz, and Willyam Kneuet, and when
thei were all armed, the Trumpettes blewe, then toward the braie marched
the foure gentlemen, with pikes and swordes, and cried harr, harr,
there was foynyng, lasshyng, and strikyng, thei within fought mightely

Forest ye shall here more here after, in the thirtie yere of this Kyng.
               
               In this season the Frenche kyng was in Italy, with all his nobilitie,
and to hym was Millain yelded, but because of pestilence he would not
entre, but departed and laied siege to the strong toune of Pauia, wherof
was capitain a valiāt Spanyard, called Anthony de Leua. The Frēche
kynges mother beyng Regent of Fraunce, perceiuyng that the king her
soonne, with all his good Capitaines were in Italy, doubted that the
kyng of Englande, in the nexte Spryng tyme would inuade Fraunce.
Wherfore she by the auice of the counsaill of Fraūce, did so muche with
the kyng of England, that her Stuard of houshold called Ihon Iokin,
had a saueconduit to come into Englande, whiche was kept close in the
house of docter Larke, a Prebendary of sainct Steuens, and euery daie
priuely spake with the Cardinall, &amp; so secretly he remained, til the .xxiiii.
daie of Ianuary, at whiche daie came to London, the president of Roan
called Monsire Brynyon, as an Ambassador from Frances the French
kyng, and was lodged with Ihon Iokyn: this Ihon Iokyn was kepte
priuie, because that no man should knowe, that there was any manne of
Fraunce, here to sollicite any cause for the Frenche Kyng, whiche after
grewe to greate trouble. For he shewed hymself to straungiers, whiche
fauored the Frenche partie, and so at last it was openly knowen, to the
kynges counsaill, and almoste to all men: but when the Emperors Ambassador
knewe this darke dealyng, he mused not a litle and saied, that
the Cardinall did driue priuie driftes, &amp; that by his meanes onley, Ihon
Iokyn was come into Englande, to entreate a peace in secret maner, or
the kynges frendes might knowe it, and al people saied, that Ihon Iokyn
was but a cast awaie of Ieane, and had no liuyng to liue on, but of
the lady Regent, and marueiled why he should be kept close, &amp; so muche
cherished of the Cardinall. For this kepyng close of this Iokyn, Englishemen
wer rebuked at the Marte in Flaunders, and Brabant. The
Emperors Ambassador and the bishop of Romes Ambassador also sore
murmured, why this Ihon Iokyn should bee kept as a spirite in close,
consideryng that there was open warre betwene the twoo kynges, and
feared that the kynges counsaill should be corrupt. This Ihon Iokyn
was muche with the Cardinall, but neuer was seen with the Kyng nor
his counsaill, but for all the secretnes, Monsire Pratt themperors Ambassadour,
knewe all the offers that he made for peace (whiche in deede
wer very greate) and how he had offered pencions, to diuerse young mē
aboute the kyng, of the whiche some wer very glad, &amp; so the noyse be reson

of suche offers ran, that a peace was likely to ensue in shorte space.
               Monsire Pratt wrote of this matter, in all hast to the Emperor, in the
whiche letters he highly commended the kyng of England, for his stedfastnes:
but he said some of the kynges counsaill, loued neither the Emperour
nor the kyng of Englande, and wrote to hym farther, all the maner
of ye secret kepyng of Ihō Iokyn. These letters at last wer brought
to the Cardinall, by what chaunce it was not openly knowen, and so he
sent for Monsire Pratt, and declared to hym the matter, whiche answered
hym, that he was counsailer and Ambassador to the Emperour, and
that it was his parte, to assertein the Emperor of euery thyng, that was
or might sound preiudicial to his maiestie, but howsoeuer that his answere
was taken, he was not fauored with the Cardinall, but he saied openly,
that it was not well ment to the Emperor, to stop his packet with
letters and to open them, and the Spanyardes saied, that the Emperor
sent them not into Englande to slepe, but to do hym seruice. The bishop
of Romes Ambassador wrote to his master, that peace was likely to bee
concluded, betwene Englande and Fraunce, and willed hym to bee the
firste frende to the Frenche kyng, rather then the seconde. Of whiche
writyng came harme after, as you shall heare.
               In this moneth tidynges came to the Kyng, howe the Marques of
Piscaire in Italy, had gotten from the Frenche kyng, a castle called the
castle. S. Angell, whiche was a greate fortificacion, of his siege at Pauie.
               There was in this monethe a Flemyng in Heddyng Castle, whiche
came often tymes to sainct Omers, &amp; promised them if thei would come
to Heddyng, he would deliuer the Castle: vpon his worde thei of saincte

horsemen, and poynted with the spie, that the fourthe daie of February,
thei would come thether, and whē the false knaue knewe the daie, he told
Monsire Pontdormie, Capitain of Heddyng, whiche incontment filled
the castle with men of warre, and laied busshementes on euery side, and
had laied the ordinaunce, all on the one side of the Castle, that waie that
the Flemynges should come. The men of warre of sainct Omers, were
conueighed by their spie, mistrustyng nothyng, to a posterne, which was
litle vsed, and when there were as many in, as the Frenchemen thought
sufficient, thei let fall the Portcolis: Then Monsire Pontdromie, cried,
slaie, slaie, then the Flemynges wist that thei wer betraied, and put them
selfes to fight for their liues, that seyng Monsire Pontdromie, cōmaū
                  ded
to fire the ordinaunce in suche haste and fury, that the flame was so
greate and fierce, that it brent thesaied Lorde Pontdromie, and .xxvii. of
his compaignions all gentlemen, the trayne was so hastely fiered, that
thei had no leasure to auoyde. In the fight tenne of the Flemynges we

graunted them, and so was taken as prisoners, the remnant that entred
lept ouer the castle wal, and so saued themselfes, and told newes to their
horsmen, whiche wer without, whiche hearyng the mischaunce, returned

toward sainct Omers.
               Sundaie the fifth daie of Marche,Ambassadors of, Flaūders. wer receiued into London, Monsire
de Beuer lorde of Camphere, Admirall of Flaunders, &amp; the President
of Malynes, called Master Ihon de la Coos, and Master Ihon de
la Gache, as Ambassadors from the lady Margaret, in the name of the
Emperor, for causes of the lowe countreis, of Brabant, Flaunders, and
Zelande: and on Tewesdaie thei wer brought to the kyng to Bridewell,
whiche nobely theim enterteined, and then thei shewed how themperors
maiestie, had commaunded theim to obey the kyng of England, as protertor
and gouernor, wherfore thei and all theirs, wer at his cōmaundement,
&amp; if thei had doen other wise, and not obeyed hym as their gouernor,
thei asked hym mercy, then the kyng and thei talked together secretly,
and then thei departed. These Ambassadors demaūded thre thynges.
               First, thei demaunded the ladie Mary the kynges onely daughter, to 
be deliuered to theim out of hande, and she to be named Emprise, and to
take possession of all the lowe countreis, and to be gouernor of thesame,
this article was not agreed to, for causes.
               Also that all suche sommes of money, as the Kyng should geue with 
her in mariage, for a dower to be made to her, should be paied incontinēt
this article was also denied.

                  d 
made warre in Fraunce, the nexte Sommer, to this the kyng saied he
would take auisement.
               Thursday the .ix. daie of Marche, at .vii. of the clocke in the mornyng
there came a gentleman in poste, from the lady Margaret gouernesse of
Flaūders, and brought letters, shewyng how that the .xxiiii. daie of February,
the siege of Pauia, where the Frenche kyng had lien long, was
raised by force of battaill, and the Frenche kyng hymself takē prisoner,
and how by the Duke of Burbon, the Uiceroy of Naples called Myngnouale,
and the Marques of Piscaire, and other of the Emperors capitaines,
the whole power of Fraunce was discomfited, &amp; how the duke
of Albany with seuen thousande men, was goyng to Naples, and how
the bishop of Rome was become French, against the Emperor, and had
sent his cosyn in aide of the Frēche kyng, with a great power. Thesame
daie the president of Roan &amp; Ihon Iokyn, wer goyng to the Court (for
thei had not yet spokē with the kyng) and in Holburne in their way was
tidynges brought them, of the takyng of the kyng their Master, and of
the losse of the feld, whiche hearyng this misauenture, returned to their
lodgyng sorowfull, and within shorte space, returned to the Regent of
Fraūce. It was thought surely that the kyng of England, would haue
had peace with the Frenche kyng, if this chaunce had not happened, for
all the people of Englande, grudged against Flaunders, for their euill
entreatyng, in the tyme of warre, and also the kyng was displeased with
theim, for enhaunsyng his coyne there, whiche was a cause that money
was daily conueighed out of the Realme, and many other causes there

were of grudge.

sang Masse, and a .xi. prelates waited on hym in pontificalles, and
after Masse was doen, the quere sang Te deum, and the mynstrelles plaied

and there kept a solempne dinner. The bishop of Scotland was muche

his apparell was sumpteous, his whodde was euer veluet or crimosyn
Satyn: but after the takyng of the Frenche kyng, he ware onely blacke
Chamlet, by whiche token men iudged his Frenche harte.
               From the .ix. daie of Marche to the .xvi. daie, the kyng had no mo letters,
of the maner of battaill of Pauie, and that daie he receiued a letter

thesaied Gropayne declared the maner of the siege, and how wel it was
planted, and how themperors men entered the Frenche campe by force,
and threwe doune their bastiles, and fought with the Frenchmen, within
their Campe, and tooke their kyng prisoner in thesame, and many other
whiche was maruell. For when the Frenche kyng entered Italy, he had
in his gard .xi.C. men, and of speres furnished twoo M.ii.C.l. and of
light horsemen eight hundred and .xx. and of footemen .lvii.M. and of
these the Duke of Albany had but eight thousande, so that there remayned
with the Frenche kyng .xlix.M.ix.C. and fiftie men, wherof was taken

whiche were .xii. greate Bombardes of brasse, and .xxiiii. greate Canon
peces .xxiiii. double Curtalles, foure double Canon peces, twoo middle
Canon peces, and eight other peces. After the feld was doen, the French
kyng was put in the custodie of the Uiceroy of Naples, whiche muche
comforted hym, and preised his valiauntnes, and praied hym to be content,
for he should haue a gentle ende, then he desired to write to his mother,
whiche was to hym graunted, the very wordes wer these.

desired the citee of Turnay, whiche kyng Lewes before tyme had loste:
the kyng whiche would that the citee of Turnay, should bee no cause of
grudge, betwene hym and the Frenche kyng, consented that for certaine
sommes of money, it should be deliuered. And farther the more to bynd
amitie betwene theim, the kyng was content, that a communicacion of
mariage should be had▪ betwene the Dolphyn of Fraunce, and the ladie
Marie Princes of Englande, yet for to entreate more loue, familiaritie,

and sware by the othe of a kyng, he would obserue &amp; kepe fermely, these
poyntes with many mo, and after the Kynges were departed, and that
the Emperoure was come to the kyng to Calice: the Frenche kyng sent
Monsire de la Roche ba
                     •
                  on with letters, declaryng that he was in perfecte
league and amitie with the Emperor, and this not withstandyng,
he within lesse space then halfe a yere, sent Robert de la Marche, to inuade
the emperors lande, and made warre in Neuert &amp; other places.
The kyng ouer Master hearyng this, of his mere charitie sent me, and other
nobles with a greate trayne to Calice, to knowe by whom the warr
began, for he promised to be enemie to hym that brake firste. To whiche
place came from the Frenche kyng, his Chanceller, and Monsire de la
Palice, and many other noble menne. And from the Emperor came his
Chanceller, and the lorde Cheuers, and there in open counsaill, the Emperors
Ambassadors, did shewe the Frenche kynges letters, signed and
sealed, by the whiche he enforced and began the warre: to whiche poynte

the Frenche Ambassadours could not answere. What should I saie, the
warre was open on bothe parties, I sent to the Frenche kyng Ambassadors,
to entreate peace, but in nowise he would concēt: wherfore I with
my compaignie returned. In the meane season (although I doubted nothyng,
the Frenche kynges faithe towarde our Master) yet, or a more
suertie, I obteigned a saueconduit for the Englishe Merchauntes, that
thei should go to Burdeaux, and vpon suertie of that our Merchantes
passed, yet he contrary to his saucconduit, toke the Merchantes goodes,
and put their bodies in prison, whiche the Turke would not haue doen.
The kyng sent gentely to hym, his herault Clarenseux, desiryng hym to
redresse all these enormities, and to paie hym his sommes, of money, due
to hym and to the Quene his sister, for her dower, whiche to doo he refused
and denied, whiche thynges you knowe, the kyng of his honor might
not suffre. Wherfore mightely he hath these three yeres, kept warre continually
bothe on lande and sea, and inuaded Fraunce with two armies
royall, and bet their tounes, castles, and fortresses, destroyed the people,
and passed the water of Somme, and proffered battaill to the Frenchemen,
in their awne countrey, and hath brought the countrey, in suche penury
and wretchednes, that in many yeres it will not be recouered.
               And the more to hurt and damage the French kyng, the kyng hath in
wages the Duke of Burbon, whiche was the greatest strengthe on the
Frenche part: by whose power and aide of other, whiche had great sommes
of money, of the kyng our Master, the Frenche kyng in persone is
now taken, and all his nobles in effect, before Pauia, and kept as prisoner
to the Emperor and the kyng our Master, and that for greate reasō:
for our Master sent sir Gregory de Cassado his Ambassador to the Uiceioy
of Naples, and to the Duke of Burbon, and the Marques of Piscaire,
with a hundred thousand Crounes, so that thei would fight with
the Frenche kyng: For the whiche money thei assented, and so gaue b

told them like tale, but some spake suche woordes to hym, and some goyng
from hym, that thei were sent to ward.
               Now were Commissioners sent to the clergie,The saiyng of the clergie. for the fourthe parte of
their landes and moueables, and in euery alsembly the priestes answered,
that thei would paie nothyng, except it were graunted by Conuocacion,
other wise not: for thei saied that neuer kyng of England, did aske
any mannes goodes, but by an ordre of the lawe, and this Commission
is not by the ordre of the lawe: wherefore thei saied, that the Cardinall
and all the doers thereof, were enemies to the kyng, and to the common
wealthe. This infamie was spoken in preachynges, and euery where.
               When this matter was opened through Englande,The grudoe of the commō people. howe the greate

For thei saied, if men should geue their goodes by a Commission, then
wer it worse then the taxes of Fraunce, and so England should be bond
and not free.
               It happened at Redyng in Barkeshire, that the Commissioners satte
for this money to be graunted, and the people in no wise would consent

to the sixt parte: but of their awne mere mynde, for the loue thei bare to

the letter, so that six Richard Weston would beare it, the which letter at
the request of the gentlemen of the coūtrey, thesaid sir Richard toke vpō
him to cary, &amp; road to the Cardinall: whiche therewith was sore greued,

speakyng with the kyng, or the Cardinall, and so muche did by saueconduite,
that he passed through Fraunce in poste, and came to the Emperor
before the Ambassadours of Englande came thether, and whether it
was by his report or otherwise, the accustomed fauor that themperor

                  ied, and the commōs in euery place were so moued, that
it was like to haue growen to a rebellion. When this mischief
was shewed to the kyng, he saied that he neuer knewe of that demaunde,
and therefore with greate diligence, he sent his letters to the
citee of London, and to all other places, in the whiche the kyng gentely
wrote, that he would demaūde no some certain, but suche as his louyng
subiectes would graunt to hym of their good mindes, toward the maintenaunce

I haue highly the kyng enformed, for y• whiche he gaue you hartie
thākes. Then I kneled doune to his grace, shewyng hym bothe your
good myndes towarde hym, and also the charges, that you continuelly
sustein, the whiche at my desire and peticion, was content to call in, and
abrogate thesame commission, &amp; where he by reason of your awne graū

might haue demaunded thesaied somme as a verie debte, yet he is

content to release and pardon thesame, and wil nothyng take of you, but
of your beneuolence: wherfore take here with you the kynges letter, and
let it be redde to the commons, and I doubt not but you will gladly do,
as louyng subiectes should do.
               Here note, that if the Cardinall had not said, that the kyng had released
and pardoned the first demaunde, the citezens would haue answered
the Cardinall, that thei neuer made no suche graunt, and for a suretie no
more thei did not: and so thei helde their peace, &amp; departed toward London,
sore grudgyng at the liyng of the Cardinal, and openly saiyng that
he was the verie cause, and occasiō of this demaunde, and would plucke
the peoples hartes from the kyng.
               The .xxviii. daie of Aprill,The common counsaill▪
                   in the Common counsaill of the citee, was
redde the kynges letter, accordyng to the effect aboue rehersed, wherfore
the citizens sent foure Aldermen, and .xii. Cominers to Hampton courte
to geue thankes to the lorde Cardinall, whiche for busines as was saied
could not speake with hym, wherefore thei returned not content. Then
euery Alderman assembled his ward, in their places accustomed, &amp; gentely
moued them of a beneuolence, to be graunted to the kyng, the which
thei openly denied, saiyng: that thei had paied inough before, with many
euill wordes.
               The .viii. daie of Maie, the Cardinall again sent for the Maior and
his brethren, whiche shewed thē what thei had doen: then saied the Cardinall,
you haue no suche commission to examyn any man, I am youre
Commissioner, I will examyne you one by one my self, and then I shall
knowe the good wil that you beare to your prince, for I will aske of you
a beneuolence in his name. Then was it answered to the Cardinall, by a
counsailer of the citee, that by the lawe there might no suche beneuolēce
be asked, nor men so examined, for it was contrary to the statute made
the first yere of kyng Richarde the thirde, also some persones commyng
before your grace, maie for feare graunt that, that all daies of their life
thei shall repent, and some to wynne your fauor, will graunt more then
thei bee able to paie of their awne, and so ronne in other mennes debtes,
so that by dredfull gladnes, and fearefull boldnes, men shall not be masters
of themselfes, but as menne dismaied, shall graunt that that their
wifes and children shall sore rewe. The Cardinall hard this saiyng verie
paciently, and answered: Sir I maruell that you speake of Richard
the third, whiche was a vsurper and a murtherer of his awne nephewes:
then of so euill a man, how can the actes be good, make no suche allegacions,
his actes be not honorable. And it please your grace said the coū
                  sailer,
although he did euill, yet in his tyme wer many good actes made
not by hym onely, but by the consent of the body of the whole realme,
whiche is the parliament. Then sir Willyam Bayly lorde Maior, kneled
doune and besought his grace, that sithe it was enacted, by the common
Counsaill of London, that euery Alderman should sit in his awne
ward, for a beneuolence to be graūted, whiche he perceiued to be against

the lawe, that thesame acte by thesame common counsall, might be reuoked
and no otherwise: well saied the Cardinall, I am content. But now
will I entre into the kynges Commission: You Maior, and you Master
Aldermen, what will you geue? my lorde saied the Maior▪ I praie you
pardō me, for if I should entre i

                  to any graunt, it might fortune to cost
me my life: your life saied the Cardinall, that is a maruelous worde, for
your will toward the kyng, will the citezens put you in ieoperdy of your
life, that w

                  re straunge: For if thei would that waie, then must the kyng

                  rōg power them to oppresse, wherfore speake no more suche
wordes,The flatteryng of the Cardinall. and with that he studied a litle and saied: My lorde Maior, let
you &amp; your citezens, if you be greued with any thyng, in this demaunde,
humbly and after a good fashiō come to me, and I shall so entreate you
that you shalbe content, and no displeasure arise, &amp; so I praie pou shewe
your neighbors, and so the Maior for that daie departed.
               The Maior did wisely not to assent to graunt to any thyng, for although
he and the Aldermen had assented, the common counsaill would
neuer haue assented. So on the next morowe▪ it was declared to the common
coūsaill, that their act that was made that euery Alderman should
sit for a beneuolence to be graunted, was against a statute lawe: wherevpon
thesaid act was anulled: and then was it declared, that euery man
should come to the Cardinall, and to graūt priuily what he would, with
this saiyng the citezens wer sore greued, then the Maior gentely shewed
them, how he durst warrant, that thei should bee entreated gentely, and
exhorted theim to go thether when thei were sent for, whiche saiyng nothyng
pleased theim: and then in a furie thei would haue had Richarde
Gresham, and Ihon Hewster Mercers, and Richarde Gibson Seriant
at armes and Merchant Tailor, banished out of the common counsail,
and so without answere made, what thei would do, thei departed home.

               The Duke of Suffolke, sat in Suffolke this season in like commission,

and by gentle handlyng, he caused the riche Clothiers to assent, and
graunt to geue the sixt parte, and when thei came home to their houses,
thei called to them their Spinners, Carders, Fullers, Weuers, &amp; other

goodes be taken from vs, wherefore trust to your selfes, and not to vs,
for otherwise it wil not be. Then began women to wepe, and young folkes
to crie, and men that had no woorke, began to rage, and assemble
theimselfes in compaignies. The Duke of Suffolke hearyng of this,
commaunded the Constables, that euery mannes harnes, should be taken
from them, but when that was knowen, then the rumor waxed more
greater, and the people railed openly on the Duke of Suffolke, and sir
Robert Dru

perceiuyng this, began to reise men, but he could gette but a small

thei would not fight: Yet the gentlemen that were with the duke
did so muche, that al the bridges wer broken, so that their assemble was
some what letted.
               The duke of Norffolke, high Threasorer and Admirall of Englande
hearyng of this, gathered a greate power in Norffolke, &amp; came towarde
the commons, and of his noblenes he sent to the cōmons, to knowe their
intent, which answered: that thei would liue and dye in the kynges causes,
and to the kyng to be obedient: When the duke wist that, he came to
thē, and then al spake at once, so that he wist not what thei meant. Then
he asked who was their Capitain, and bad that he should speke: then a
well aged manne of fiftie yeres and aboue, asked licence of the Duke to
speake, whiche graūted with good will. My lorde saied this man, whose
name was Ihon Grene, si
                     •
                  he you aske who is our capitain, for soth his
name is Pouertie, for he and his cosyn Necessitie, hath brought vs to
this dooyng, for all these persones and many mo, whiche I would were
not here, liue not of our selfes, but all wee liue, by the substanciall occupiers
of this countrey, and yet thei geue vs so litle wages, for our workmāship,
that scacely we be able to liue, and thus in penurie we passe the
tyme, we, our wifes and childrē, and if thei by whom we liue, be brought
in that case, that thei of their litle, cannot helpe vs to earne our liuyng,
then must we perishe, and dye miserably. I speke this my lorde, the cloth
makers haue put all these people, and a farre greater nomber frō worke
the husbande men haue put awaie their seruauntes, and geuen vp houshold,
thei say, the kyng asketh so muche, that thei be not able to do as thei
haue doen before this tyme, &amp; then of necessitie, must we dye wretchedly:
wherfore my lorde, now accordyng to your wisedom, consider our necessitie.

The Duke was sory to heare their complaint, and well he knewe
that it was true: then he saied, neighbors, seuer your selfes a sonder, let
euery man depart to his home, and chose furthe foure, that shall answer
for the remnant, and on my honor I will send to the kyng, and make hū
                  ble
intercession for your pardon, whiche I truste to obtein, so that you
will depart, then al thei answered thei would, and so thei departed home.
               At the twoo dukes requestes, commissioners of great aucthoritie wer
sent to theim, then the Duke of Norffolke, and the Duke of Suffolke
came to Bery, &amp; thether came many people of the countrey, in their shirtes,
and halters about their neckes, mekely desiryng pardon for their offences:
the Dukes so wisely handeled themselfes, that the commons wer

and goyng, betwene the lordes and commons: then the demaunde of money
seased in all the realme, for well it was perceiued, that the commons
would none paie.
               After this, the twoo dukes came to London, and brought with theim
the chief capitaines of the rebelliō, whiche wer put in the Flete, and then
the kyng came to Westminster▪ to the Cardinals place: Wherupon this

God knoweth all. Well said the kyng, some haue enformed me that
my realme was neuer so riche, and that there should neuer trouble haue
risen of that demaunde, and that men would pay at the first request, but
now I finde all contrary, then euery man helde his peace.

that his counsaill should attempt, suche a doubtfull matter in his name▪
and to bee denied bothe of the spiritualtie and temporaltie, for although
some graunted for feare, before the commissioners, yet when thei wer departed,
thei denied it again. Then the kyng saied, I will no more of this

trouble: Let letters bee sent to all shires, that this matter maie no more
bee spoken of,The Pardon of the greate demaunde. I will pardon all theim, that haue denied the demaunde,

the kyng. Then letters were sent to all commissioners to cease, with
instruccions how to declare the kynges pardon. In whiche declaracion,
was shewed, that the Cardinal neuer assented, to the first demaunde, and
in the instruccions was comprehended, that the lordes and the Iudges,
and other of the kynges counsaill, diuised thesame demaunde, and that
the Cardinall folowed the mynd of the whole counsaill, these two poyn

people toke all this for a mocke, and saied God saue the Kyng, for the
Cardinall is knowen well inough, the commons would heare no praise
spoken of the Cardinall, thei hated hym so muche.

so departed. The next daie, all this was rehersed to the cōmon counsail,
whiche humbly thanked the kyng for the pardon: but twoo thynges thē
sore displeased, one was that the Cardinall bad theim saie, thei were the
kynges body and goodes, thei saied that thei vsed no dissimulacion, for
thei would not saie thei were the kynges, but thei thought and were the
kynges in deede, and not in saiyng: the seconde was, that the Cardinall
excused hymself, that he was ignorant of the first cōmission: For all thei

Scudder of Kent, these twoo wer brought from the Tower, bare footed
in their shirtes through London, to the Starre Chamber, and there the
Cardinall shewed theim their offences, with terrible woordes: and after
that he shewed the kynges mercie, extended to thē and declared their pardon
and so thei wer deliuered.
               The morowe after beyng the .xxx. daie, wer the chief of the rebelles of
Suffolke, brought to the Starre chamber barre, and there the Kynges
counsaill learned, laied sore to theim their offence, but the Cardinall declared
for thē the kynges pardon: then the kynges Attorney, asked suertie
for their good aberyng, thei answered that thei could finde none, then
saied the Cardinall I will be one, because you be my countrey men, and
my lorde of Norffolke will bee another, and so thei were discharged, and
had money to bryng them home: Now here is an ende of this commissiō,
but not an ende of inward grudge and hatered, that the commons bare

               You haue hard before,Riot ac Beggam. how the Cardinall suppressed many monasteries,
of the whiche one was called Beggam in Sussex, the whiche was
verie commodious to the countrey: but so befell the cause, that a riotus
compaignie, disguysed and vnknowen, with painted faces and visures,
came to thesame Monasterie, and brought with them the Chanons, and
put them in their place again, and promised theim that whensoeuer thei
rang the bell, that thei would come with a great power, and defende thē.
This doyng came to the eare of the kynges counsail, whiche caused the
Chanons to be taken, and thei confessed the capitaines, whiche wer emprisoned,
and sore punished.
               The Cardinall aboute this season, by his power Legantyne, sent a
Chappelein of his, called Doctor Ihon Alein, a man of more learnyng
then vertue, or good conscience, to visite all places religious: this priest
roade in his goune of veluet, with a greate trayne, and was receiued into

and toke suche greate sommes for his visitacion, that the religious sore
were greued, and murmured muche against it, and in especiall, for thei
were charged with greate sommes of money to the kyng, and now this
sodain visitacion or ‡predacion,Predation, that is a robbery. cleane shaued them. The common people
spake muche against this, and also thei saied, that thē Cardinall by
Uisitacions, makyng of Abbottes, probates of testamentes, grauntyng

of faculties, licēses, and other pollynges in his Courtes legantines, had
made his threasore egall with the kynges, &amp; yet euery yere he sent greate
sommes to Rome: this was their communicacion, euer against the Cardinall,
and his high aucthoritie, &amp; the spirituall men moste disdained it.
               You shall vnderstande, the kyng in his freshe youth, was in the cheynes
of loue, with a faire damosell called Elizabeth Blount, daughter to
sir Ihon Blunt knight, whiche damosell in syngyng, daunsyng, and in
all goodly pastymes, exceded all other, by the whiche goodly pastymes,
she wan the kynges harte: and she again shewed hym suche fauour, that
by hym she bare a goodly manne child, of beautie like to the father and
mother. This child was well brought vp, like a Princes child, and whē
he was .vi. yere of age, the kyng made hym knight, and called hym lorde
Henry Fitz Roy, and on Sondaie beyng the .xviii. daie of Iune, at the
Manor or place of Bridewell, thesaied Lorde ledde by twoo Erles,
was created Erle of Notynghā, and then he was brought backe again
by thesaied twoo Erles: then the Dukes of Norffolke and Suffolk, led
hym into the great chamber again and the kyng created hym, Duke of
Richemond and Somerset:The creacion of the duke of Richemond. &amp; thesame daie was the lorde Henry Courtenay
Erle of Deuonshire, and cosyn germain to the kyng, was created

tooke so muche vpon hym, and made the Kyng beleue, that all thynges
should be to his honor, and that he neded not to take any pain, so that to
hym was the charge of all thynges committed, at the whiche wise menne
becked, and light men laughed, thynkyng great foly in his high presūpcion.
And at this tyme, thesaied Cardinall gaue to the kyng, the lease of
the Manor of Hampton Court, whiche he had of the lease of the lord of
Sainct Ihones, and on whiche he had doen greate coste. Therefore the
kyng of his gētle nature, licensed hym to lie in his Manor of Richemōd
at his pleasure, and so he laie there at certain tymes: but when the common
people, and in especiall suche, as had been kyng Henry the seuēthes
seruauntes, sawe the Cardinal kepe house in the Manor royal of Richmond,

whiche kyng Henry the seuenth, so highly estemed it, was a maruell
to here, how thei grudged and saied, see a Bochers dogge lye in the
Manor of Richemond: these with many approbrious wordes, were spoken
against the Cardinall, whose pride was so high that the nothyng regarded,
and yet was he hated so moste men.
               In this season the Frenche kynges mother, Regent of Fraunce, and
the three estates of the realme, assembled together, concernyng the estate
of their realme: First, thei sent a solēpne Ambassador or themperor, with
articles (as thei thought resonable) for ye deliueraūce of the Frēch kyng
and also for a peace, thei sent also a messenger to the kyng of Englande,
for a saueconduite for an Ambassadour, to be sent into Englande, for a
treatie of peace, whiche to the messenger, was graunted and diliuered.
               Then came ouer as Ambassadour from Fraunce, Ihon Iokyn now
called Monsire de Uaux, whiche as you haue hard in the last yere, was
kept secret in Master Larkes house, and when he came into Englande,
he was welcomed of the Cardinall, and there betwene theim were suche
communicacions, that at the sute of thesaied Ihon Iokyn, a truce was
concluded, from the .xiii. daie of Iuly for fortie daies, betwene England
and Fraunce, bothe on the sea and beyonde the sea. Full well wist Ihon
Iokyn, what he meant, when he desired peace for fortie daies, for in that
season the Pikardes, might haue a quiet haruest, to cary in their Corne,
whiche thei should not haue, if the garrisōs of Calice and Guysnes: and
other within the Englishe pale, had not been restreined from warre, and
also the Fishermen of Depe, Bullein, and Traiport, had quiete fi
                     •
                  hyng,
by this truce, for the nauie of Englāde, was come home to harborough,
this truce greued the menne of warre on bothe parties, it was so sodain
that thei wist not well what to do.
               When the Flemynges hard tell of truce, and that thei were not comprehended
in thesame, thei began to rayle and said, that the kyng 
                     〈◊〉
                   Englande▪
had not doen truly with thē, to take a truce without their knowlege:
the Englishemen answered, that thei had no Ambassadour in Englande,
and if that thei had had any, thei should haue been made priuie,
but the kyng would sende theim no woorde of his affaires, if thei would
not sende to knowe, for he ought their master, nor y
                     •
                  t them suche seruice.
               The Frenchemen in this season, enterprised to enter into Flaunders,
by Newe dike, but thei were manfully defended by the Flemynges, and
because the Frenchemen passed by the Englishe pale, and had nothyng
doen to them, the Flemynges wer sore displeased, with the Engl
                     •
                  shemen
of Calice.
               In the latter ende of Iuly came into Englande, Monsire Bryond
chief President of Roan, and was brought to the Cardinalles presence,
at the Manor of Richemond, and when his Commission was shewed, 
                     〈◊〉
                  
was doubted whether the aucthoritie wer sufficiēt, because the▪ ky
                     •
                  g his
Master was prisoner in Spain: but then he shewed aucthoritie geuen
to the Lady Regent, and certain nobles of the realme of Fraunce, by the

Frenche kyng in open Parliament, before his goyng into Italy for all
thynges that 
                     •
                  id or mighte concerne his Realme, duryng his absence.
When the Commission was thought reasonable, then was rehersed to
the Frenchemen their double
                     •
                  es, their vnstedfastnes, and how thei had
behaued theimselfes toward the kyng of Englande: then thei answered
if wee haue offended▪ you haue vs punished, for you haue br
                     •
                  nt our tounes,
slain our people, destroyed our countrey, so that you haue brought
the lowe parties, to a long miserie without recouery, and therefore sithe
we be the lesers for our offence, yet we sue for peace, least we be more punished.
After long consult
                     •
                  cion, thei offered many offers: first, to pay all
suche sommes of money as wer due, bothe for the yerely tribute, and also
for the citee of Turnay, and the Frenche Quenes dowar, and farther to
recompence the kyng o
                     •
                   Englande his expences doen in the warres.
               Duryng this treatie, woorde was brought to the kyng of Englande,
that there was a truce so
                     •
                  ainly concluded, betwene the realme of Fraūce
and the 
                     •
                  adie Margaret, Duches of Sauoy, and Gouerner of Flaunde
                     •
                  s
and the lowe countreis, for the space of .v. monethes, so that no 
                     •
                  ntercourse
should be betwene them for merchantes, but by saueconduite,
and that this Proclamacion was proclamed at sainct Omers, the 
                     •
                  irste
daie of August, 
                     •
                  herupon the kyng was contented, that a peace should
bee taken from the .xiiii. daie of August, to the firste daie of December,
whiche was proclamed in London: and by this truce euery Englishemā
without sauecondute, might passe into Fraunce, &amp; thei likewise into England.
When this truce was proclaymed, the people 
                     〈◊〉
                   &amp; said,
now hath the Frenchemen gotten their fishyng quictly, and if thei had
been kept from that, thei had been vndoen▪ and so with 
                     •
                  aire wordes thei
helpe themselfes, whiche 
                     〈◊〉
                   we haue warre again, shall hurte vs, for this
Herryng shall vitaill their tounes the next yere. This the common people
talked, but it was to no purpose.
               This yere the kyng sent Docter Henry Standishe,Ambassadors into Dēmark Bishop of sainct
Asse, &amp; sir Ihon Baker knight into the realme of Denmarke, to comen
and entreate with the nobles of the Countery for the reduccion of kyng
Cristierne, to his realme, Croune, and dignitie, but all that could be said
or perswaded, could not bryng the Danes to any reson, thei hated hym
so for his greate crueltie, and in especiall for the greate tiranny that he
committed at Stokeholme in Swethen, where he desired a greate nomber
of his nobles to a banket, and after the bāket, strake of their heddes.
When the Ambassadours of Englande sawe that thei could not bryng
hym in again: thei then began to require, that his sonne might haue the
croune and dominion, whiche neuer them offended, and was of progeny
borne of lady Isabell, sister to the Emperor Charles the .v. whiche also
made greate labor and instaunce for thesame: but the Danes answered
thei would none of his procreacion, for thei said, the sonne would folow
the father, or els at the least he would reuenge his fathers wrong, and so
with this answere thei departed.
               
                  
So muche did the Ambassadors of Fraunce, bothe by offers and entreatyes,
that the kyng of England and his counsaill, did condiscende to
a peace, and the more soner because thei sawe if warre should continue,
money must be demaunded of the cōmons, whiche had leuer rebell then
pay any more money, as you haue hard in the last yere. Whē peace was
concluded, then were Proclamacions of thesame, sent to euery citee and
good toune, and the .viii. daye of September, thys peace was proclaymed
solemply with a Trumpet through the citee of London, the effecte
wherof was, that vpon humble suite and large profers, made by the lady
Regent of Fraunce, &amp; the three estates of the same, a peace, league, &amp;
amitie was concluded, betwene bothe the kynges of England &amp; Fraūce,
and their countreys and subiectes, so that the subiectes of either realme
maie lawfully passe and repasse, into the others realme and dominions,
to bye and sell frankely and frely, without let or interrupcion, and that
this league in no wise, was a breche of the league taken wyth the Emperor
and the lady Margaret, gouernesse of Flaunders in no point, but
that thesaied Emperour and lady Margaret, and all other the kynges
old and auncient confederates and alies, wer comprehended in thesame,
and for due restitucion to be made to the Frēchmen, there was appoyncted
the reuerende father, Cutberd bishop of Lōdon, and forrestitucion to
be made to the Englishemē, was appoynted the chief Presidēt of Roan.
               And on the .xi. daie of September, was a truce proclamed in Spain,
in the toune of Uale Dolito, betwene themperor and the Frenche kyng,
from that daie to the ende of December next ensuyng, at whiche time the
Emperor had not seen the Frenche kyng, whiche was conueighed by sea
out of Italy into Spain, to a Castle called Madrill, and there remaygned:
and shortly after fell sore sicke, and was in greate ieoperdy, for the
whiche the Frēchmen cared litle, for thei saied that if he died, thei should
paie no raunsome, and then their realme shoulde be quiet.
               This peace betwene England and Fraunce, nothing pleased the Flemynges,
wherefore when thei had dronke well, thei spake largely, and
bosted how thei had victailed the English armies, and found them cartes
and cariages, and thought it not kyndly doen, to refuse them as old
frendes &amp; make peace wyth old enemies, but thei did not considre what
money the Englishemen left in their countrey, nor how the Frenchmen
for dred of the Englishemen, would not inuade Flaunders, so that thei
lyued quietly, all this thei considered not.
               In thesame moneth this peace was proclamed, in Paris, Liōs, Roan
and Amias: by this peace the kyng of Englande, should receiue at certain
daies .xx. hundred thousande Crounes, whiche then was foure hundred
thousand pound sterlyng, of the whiche one paiment of fiftie thousande
pounde was paied in hande. After this peace taken, all the men of
warre, that were aboute the retinue of Calice, Hammes, and Guysnes,
we called home, and the shippes brought into the hauens, and many a
Kreker wist not how to lyue.
               
                  
In the moneth of October wer sent into Fraunce, sir Willyam Fitz-Willyam
Threasorer of the kynges house, and docter Tayllor, as Ambassadors
from the kyng of England, &amp; wer receiued through Fraunce
very honorably, and by long iorneis at the last, came to the citie of Liōs
the .xxiiii. daie of Nouember, where to them wer presented, Wine, Fishe,
Fleshe, and Ware, and thei wer visited with diuerse noble men. And on
the .xxvi. daie thei were conueighed to the Courte by twoo Erles, and at
the gate receiued with twoo Cardinalles, and so brought to the lady regent,
whiche with muche honor theim receiued, and then thei deliuered
the kynges letters, whiche she tooke in greate reuerence, and so with her
counsaill, departed into her priuie chamber, and there taried almost two
houres, and then came out again, to whom Docter Tailor made an eloquent
Oracion in Latin, of the commodities of peace, and declared that
the kyng his Master for very loue, and not for no dred nor nede did cō
                  discend
to peace. To whom the bishop of Besanson, Chaunceller to the
Lady Regent made answere, and that doen, the Ambassadors were feasted,
and serued with men of greate estate, and after that thei wer conueighed
to their lodgynges.
               And on Sondaie next ensuyng, the Ambassadors wer conueighed to
the Courte,The league sworne. and from thence the lady Regent and all the Court, rode solemply
to the Cathedrall churche of Lions, and there a Cardinall sang
a solempne Masse, and after that Masse was dooen, the Lady Regent
toke the twoo Ambassadors, the one on the right hande▪ and the other on
the left hande, and so went vp to the high aultar, and there she laied her
hande on the Canon and Crucifix of the Masse boke, and there sware to
obserue, fulfill, and kepe, all the articles and agrementes, concluded in
the league and treatie of peace, by her commissioners. And whē this was
doen, the bishop of Bisanson made an eloquent sermon, takyng for his
antitheme. Quis est homo qui uult uitam, diligit dies uidere bonos, Inquire pacem. &amp;c. In this
sermon he muche praised the kyng of Englāde, whiche assented to peace
and lauded the Cardinall, whom he called the Legate of God, for counsailyng
hym to peace: for now was Fraūce free, and aall hostilitie seased,
and when this sermon was doen, Te deum was song, and then the Trumpettes
blewe, and all other instrumentes Musaicall, and then the Lady
Regent, with all her trayne returned to the palace, &amp; there were the Ambassadors
highly feasted, and then sir Willyam Fitz Willyam toke his
leaue, and came shortly into Englande, leauyng behynde hym Doctor
Tayler, whiche taried there till the Frenche kyng was deliuered.
               When the articles of peace, wer knowen to themperor and his counsaill,
full well wist thei that the kyng of Englande now would be frend
to the Frenche kyng, wherefore he and his subiectes, shewed themselfes
more straunge and vnkynde to the Englishemen, then thei had been accustomed.
In somuche that the Englishe merchauntes, put vp a supplicacion
to the Emperor, shewyng hym how their goodes were taken, by
letters of Marke, their shippes restrained, newe imposicions taken of

theim, and moste of all thei complained, that by an acte made in Spain
called Premetica whiche ordeineth that euery cloth, should bee of a certain
nomber of thredes, the clothes of Englande there could not bee solde, to
the great hynderaunce of the Englishe Merchauntes: For the clothiers
of England, knowe not the nomber appoynted by the statute, and when
thei make cloth, thei knowe not to what countrey that cloth shalbe sold,
of these thynges the Englishe Merchauntes desired a redresse.
               At a daie appoynted the Englishmen had an answere deliuered them
in writyng, conteignyng certain articles. The firste, if any wronges bee 
dooen vnto you, our Iustice is open in euery place. The second, as touchyng 
letters of Marke, we will be auised by our counsaill. The third,
as touchyng your shippes, we frely graunt that you shal haue our frēdship
liberally, so that with your awne shippes and goodes, you maie go
at youre pleasure, passyng or makyng abode. And as touchyng customes,
or Imposicions of newe: The accident maie cause vs so to doo, but
that shalbee in suspence. And finally as touchyng our Premetica, made by 
the lordes of our counsaill, and by vs affirmed, wee will not breake, but
wee will suffre to the intent that you Englishe Mer
                     •
                  hauntes, maie
bryng true and well made clothe, for the whiche you shall bee the better
welcome: this was the very answere that the Englishe Merchauntes
had, of the Emperor and his counsaill.
               In this Wynter was greate death in London, wherefore the Terme
was adiorned, and the king for to eschew the plague, kept his Chrstmas
at Eltham with a small nomber, for no manne might come thether, but
suche as wer appoynted by name: this Christmas in the kynges house,
was called the still Christmas. But the Cardinall in this sea
                     •
                  on, laye at
the Manor of Richemond, and there kept open housholde, to lordes, ladies,
and all other that would come, with plaies and disguisyng in most
royall maner: whiche sore greued the people, and in especial the kynges
seruauntes, to se hym kepe an open Court, and the kyng a secret Court.
               The Cardinall came to Eltham the .viii. daie of Ianuary, and taried
there till the .xxii. daie. In whiche season the Cardinall, and other of the
kynges coūsaill, sat for a direccion to be taken in the kynges house, and
first it was considered, that the greate nomber of the yomen of the gard
were very chargeable, and that there were many officers farre striken in
age: whiche had seruauntes in the Courte, and so the kyng was serued
with their seruauntes, and not with his awne seruauntes, whiche was
thought not conuenient Wherfore first the officers seruauntes, wer put
out of the Courte, and many old officers were put to liue in their countreys,
but the kyng of his bountie enhaunsed their liuynges, for he that
had three pound wages, had sixe pound annuitie, without attendaunce,
and he that had .xl.s. had foure pound, and so euery man after that rate,
and young menne were put in their romes. Then was there .lxiiii. of the
gard, whiche had .xii.d. the daie checked, put out of that wages, and thei
had .vi.d. a daie vnchecked, and should dwell in their countreys &amp; come

not at the court, til thei wer sent for except it wer for suites: in the whiche
the Cardinall promised thē, to be their helper: Alas what sorowe, &amp; what
lamentacion was made, when all these persones should depart the court
Some saied that poore seruauntes wer vndoen and must steale: Some
saied that thei wer found of the reuercions of the officers seruice, so that
for them was nothyng more set out at the bres
                     •
                  er, and it was greate charit

put out, wer now not able to fynde themselfes and their horse, to doo the
Kyng seruice. Other saied, that now thei would polle and pill in their
countreys, &amp; oppresse the poore people, thus euery anm had his saiyng.
               At this season the Cardinall made many ordin linces, concernyng the
kynges house, whiche bee at this daie called the statutes of Eltham, the
whiche some saied wer more profitable then honor

               This monethe of Ianuary was a peace concluded, betwene the realmes
of England and Scotlande, for three yeres and sixe monethes, of
the whiche the Scottes wer very glad, and especially the borderers, for
thei wer sore hurt by this warre.
               This yere the kyng on Shrouetewesdaie, kept a solempne Iustes at

compaignie, had refused to agree to certain articles, whiche the Frenche
kyng had offered hymself, thesaied Duches had license of the Emperor,
to go to Madrill, where the Frenche kyng was kepte as prisoner, and
there to knowe his mynd. When she was there, she &amp; other diuised suche
a waie, that the Frenche kyng should haue scaped, and poste horses wer
laied euery where: this was not so secrete,

                   but the Emperor was thereof,
enformed, and toke certain Frenchemen, whiche confessed how all thynges
should haue been brought to passe. The Duches of Alaunson hearyng
that this priuitie was opened, on post horses with all spede returned
into Fraunce, leuyng the whole matter at large.
               But for all this the lordes of Fraunce, ceased not daily to sue, for the
deliueraunce of their souereigne lorde, and at last to the Emperor was
deliuered a boke for the Frenche kynges deliueraunce, for the Emperor
saied he would nothyng demaund of hym, for hauyng hym he had more
then he could geue hym. Then the Frenche kyng and his counsaill, offered
a boke conteignyng many articles to the Emperoure: and when the
Emperor had well vnderstande the contentes of thesame, he saied to the
Frenche Ambassadors, is this the full will and agrement of your Master,
thei answered yea: well saied the Emperor, if this be his awne offre,
I truste that he will kepe it. Then themperor thought best to bryng the
Frenche kyng to more libertie, and to visite hym hymself, whiche he had
not doen but in the tyme of his sickenes. Where the .xiiii. daie of February,

with a noble repaire, to whom the Emperor made lo reuerence, and declared
to hym how all victories, consist in the hande of God, and where
greate debate, warre, and strief, had lond continued betwene thē, he said
it was the very hādy worke of God, to deliuer hym to captiuitie, so that

by water with the Emperor and his subiectes, of all landes, territories,

                   Item, he released all the pencions, whiche he claimed of the realmes
of Naples &amp; Scicile, whiche was yerely a hundred thousand dukattes.
               
                   Item, for the surer performaunce of all these articles, it was agreed
th
                     •
                  t the Frenche kyng should at his departyng▪ deliuer into the Emperors
handes, the Dolphin of Uien, and Henry Duke of Orleaunce, his

twoo elder sonnes, whiche should remain in Spain, till that all these articles
wer performed: and if after he came into his realme, the three estates
of Fraunce, would not condiscend and agree to these articles, which
he had offered and sworne, then he should shortly come again into spain,
and yeld hymself prisoner again, and his children then to be redeliuered
into Fraunce.
               Item, for the more fortificacion of this concorde, and for the more amitie 
to be had betwene the twoo princes and their realmes, the Emperor
offered in mariage to the Frenche kyng, the noble princes lady Elinor
late Quene of Portyngall, with a greate dowar, and offered to hym
with her in mariage three faire lordeshippes, called Ansames, Maconoyes,
and Barsur, the whiche the Frenche kyng ioyfully accepted: But
this offre was condicionally, so that the whole agrement toke effecte, or
els not. Some saied as you heard before, that the Frenche Quene was
poysoned for this intent: but euill tongues neuer saied well. To al these
articles and many mo, the Frenche kyng sware before the Emperor, and
all his nobles the .xiiii. daie of February.
               In the tyme of this entreatie came into Spayne, Charles Duke of
Burbon whiche appeled the Frenche kyng, that he contrary to al right
and Iustice, had procured and imagened, the death and destruccion of
thesaied Duke without any cause, but onely to possede his soueraigneties
and dominions, by reason whereof, thesaied Duke was compelled
to liue in exile, out of his countrey, and that the Regent of Fraunce, contrary
to Iustice had proclaimed hym a traitor, and seazed all his goods
and landes, wherefore he desired that the Frenche kyng, might to hym
make a condigne recompence: to whom the Emperour answered, that a
prisoner might not bee appeled: but yet for his good seruice, the Emperor
did so muche, that an article was concluded, that the duke of Burbō
should bee restored to his firste title, state, honor, and dignitie, and to all
his other Duches, Counties, seigniories, and Dominions, and there the
Frenche kyng frely pardoned to hym al offences, and sware that al proces,
proclamacions, impeticions, had or dooen against hym should bee
voyde, annulled and repeled, and farther the Frenche kyng, in recōpence
of al wronges doen to him, and for the restitucion of his goodes, promised
and sware to paie thesame duke .CC. thousande crounes, with al the
rentes, and profites receiued of the landes of thesaied duke, in the tyme
of his exile. When all these articles wer concluded, sworne, and appoynted,
the Emperour iudged that the Frenche kyng, would neuer loue the
Duke of Burbon, and that by some newe found faute, or by some priuy
enemie, he might bee brought to confusion: wherefore of his noble liberalitie,
consideryng the good seruice that the duke had doen to hym, and
might do if he were of possessions and dominions, gaue vnto the Duke
the whole Duchie of Millain, so that thesaied duke should finde yerely
foure thousande footemen, and fiue hundred men of armes, and paie to
the Emperor yerely foure thousande Ducates, but he neuer obteigned

the possession, for lacke of the inuesture or creacion: Also the Emperoure
gaue to the Uiceroy of Naples, the Duchie of Boysee, and the Countie
of Ast, and many greate rewardes for his good seruice.

and that night 
                     •
                  ites was made through all London. The common people
said as thei thought: some saied the peace was honorable to the Emperoure,
and other saied, the Frenche kyng would not kepe his promise,
when he was once deliuered, and so it proued.

                   of his
deliuery, &amp; also the cōfort that he had for the conclusion of peace: of whiche
kynd remembraunce, the French kyng muche reioysed. The French
kyng toke his leaue of themperor, &amp; toke his iorney into Fraunce ward,
and came to Uictoria, in whiche season the fame went, that the Dolphin
whiche should haue been deliuered, as one of the hostages for the Frēch
Kyng his father was disseased, and so the Frenche Kyng was staied for
xv. daies, till the truth was knowen: other saied that the cause was that
there wer betwene Fontrabie and Bayon .xxx.M. men, and doubted lest
if he had been brought doune to Foūtraby, he might haue been rescued:
but whatsoeuer the cause was, he was restraigned as you haue harde.
               And at the last when the daie came of his diliuery,The deliue
                        •••
                      of the French Kyng. and he was discretely
moued, that he should not speake to his children, for feare that lamentacion
and sorowe might in suche wise rise, that hurte might ensue
of it. Whē the daie was come that he should be deliuered, there was betwene
the borders of Fraunce and Spain, a Lake of no great depenes,
in the middes whereof was laied a greate emptie boate at an anker, and
at euery shore was another boate, and when the French kyng was come
to the banke, he entered the boate on the Spanishe side, and sixe Spaniardes
with hym, and like wise on the Frenche part the twoo Princes
sonnes to the Frenche kyng, entered the other boate and sixe Frenchmen
with them, and so bothe the boates came to the boat liyng in the middes,
the Frenche kyng entered at the one ende, and his children at the other,
and passed through the great boate, and euen in the middest of the boate
thei met, and he with his hande blessed theim, without speakyng of any
wordes, but sadly regarded theim, and so he entered into the boate with
the Frenchemen, and his children into the boate with Spaniardes, and
eche of them were shortly at the shore, and mounted on horsebacke, and

the Frenche kyng rode to Bayon, where he was nobely receiued, almost
of all the nobles in the realme, and in especiall of his mother: and his .ii.
children were 
                     〈◊〉
                   to Fountraby and so vpward, and were well
cherished in all thynges, by the great Constable of Spain and his wife.
               Thus was Frances the Frenche kyng, cōueighed into his realme the
xxi. daie of Marche, whiche was taken the .xxiiii. daie of February, the
yere last past.
               After that themperor had concluded, &amp; taken his leaue of the Frenche
kyng, he rode to the faire citee of Ciuill, and there he with greate triūph
maried lady Isabell, daughter to kyng Emanuell of Portyngall,The mariage of themperor. with
whom he had greate threasures and sommes of money, and great frendship
of the Portyngalles, for he had .xi. hundred thousande Ducates
with her mariage. When this mariage was knowen in Englande, the
Englishemen sore murmured, that the Emperor beyng at Wynsore, in
the .xiiii. yere of the king, had faithfully promised to mary, the lady Mary,
daughter to the Kyng of Englande. But for a verie truthe the Emperoures
counsaill was not content with the answere made to Monsire
de Beuers the last yere, and so counsailed the Emperour, not to tary for
the lady Mary whiche was young: and also thei saied that she was begotten
of the kyng of Englande by his brothers wife. And also an acte
was made in Spain, that he should not depart the countrey, till he had
issue. All these thynges were laied to hym, whiche caused hym to encline
to mariage, and seyng the great offer that the kyng of Portyngal made
to hym, he was there to agreyng, and so maried the lady Isabell, sister to
kyng Ihon of Portyngall.

betwene hym and his brother and perpetuall alie the French kyng,

a warded into euery shire, for the execucion of thesame, so that in all places,
Tables, Dice, Cardes, and Boules, wer taken and brent. Wherfore
the people murmured against the Cardinall▪ saiyug: that he grudged at
euery mannes pleasure, sauyng his awne, but this Proclamacion small
tyme endured: and when young men were forbidden Boules, and suche
other games: some fell to drinkyng, and some to ferettyng of other meu

and nothyng happened worthye to bee written of: I will returne to the
Frenche kyng, now comen again into his realme.
               When he was at Paris he saied and wrote to the Emperour, that he
would obserue &amp; kepe his promises in euery point, but what he thought
I will not iudge: For shortly after he set 
                     •
                  urth a boke, called the appollogie
or defence against the conuencion or agrement made betwene the
Emperor and hym at Madrill, allegyng that he was cōpelled to make
that agrement, or els he should neuer haue been diliuered: He alleged
farther that the Lawers of his realme clerely determined, all promises
and couenauntes made by any persone to his awne hurt, with hym that
is more of power then he to be made by compulsiō, and so of none effect
and not to be performed. He also saied that the gouernors of the Lawe,
determined that no othe or promise is of any effecte, where a manne is in
ieoperdie of life, or of perpetuall imprisonement or bondage, and moste
in especiall when it is doen by compulsion or thretenyng.Moreouer he
saied that he might geue awaie nothyng apperteignyng to his Croune,
without thassent of his peeres, and the three estates of his realme (to the
whiche he was sworne at the time of his Coronaciō, whiche would therto
in no wise assent, and therfore he saied that his othe and promes was
voyd, and so he declared to the Uiceroy of Naples, beyng then with him
as Ambassadour for the Emperor, and offered for his raunsome to paye
asmuche money as euer Frenche kyng paied, with diuerse other articles
of newe diuised.
               When these articles came to the Emperor, he them refused and saied,
that he had desired nothyng impossible of the Frenche Kyng, and if he

might not or would noy kepe, the appoyntemēt betwene theun made, yet
he bad hym kepe that poynt of couenaunt, whiche onely depended in his
will, that was that he should yelde hymself prisoner againe, and so he
should haue his children deliuered: and then he would reasonably commen
with hym, of newe articles of agrement, and as to he appollegie set
furthe by the Frenche kyng, that his othe and promesse was voyde, and
made by compulsion and threatenyng, it was answered by another boke
called the Refutacion or Ouercommyng of the apollogie, of the conuē
                  ncion
of Madrill. Whiche twoo woorkes were so eloquently set furth,
with suche and so many perswacions and allegacions, bothe on the one
part and the other, that it would comber a wise man (except he were perfectly
indifferent) to iudge to whiche parte he should moste encline, and
geue credence, therefore I leaue it at large.
               After that the Frenche kyng was deliuered, and the peace concluded,
the Emperor was fully determined to passe the seas into Italy, and so
to Rome, and there to be crouned Emperor, wherof hearyng the bishop
of Rome, called Pope Clement the seuenth, a man of great wit and vice,
and of litle vertue or learnyng: much doubted in hymself what damage
might come to hym, if the emperor had bothe Naples, Scicill, and the
Duchie of Millain, and also wer crouned Emperor. Wherefore he sent
to the Uenicians, and to the Florētines, and to Fraunces Sforce duke
of Millain, whiche had committed treason against themperor, and was
depriued by iudgeme
                     •
                  t of his name &amp; dignitie, and thesame geuen to the
Duke of Burbon, but yet by power he kept muche of the possession: and
declared to them, by what puyssaunce the Emperor would come into Italy,
and what greate possessions he▪ had there, at euery ende of Italy, so
that if he wer once crouned Emperor, he would loke to haue the seigniorie
of all Italy: wherefore thei consulted and debated for their awne
suretie, how to banishe him and his all Italy by power: and as thei wer
debatyng of this matter, thei hard worde how the French kyng was returned
into Fraunce, and sought all waies and meanes, how to breake
with the Emperour. When thei sawe so open an accion offered to theim,
with al diligence thei sent their seuerall Ambassadors, that is to saie, the
Pope twain, the duke of Uenice called Andrew Gritty, one (whiche was
his secretorie) and the Florentynes one, and the Duke of Millaine one,
these fiue Ambassadours came to the Frenche Kyng, and delcared what
ioye and gladnes their masters had of his safe returne into his realme,
and then thei shewed to him how thei by the Bishop of Romes exhortacion
had diuised a league, whiche should set a perpetuall peace betwene
all princes Christen, and for the more expedicion, thei had set furth and
agreed vpō articles, for the whole league. When the Frenche kyng saw
the articles it was as he would haue it, for he thought by the whole power
of the confederates, his children should be deliuered, &amp; he yet again
once to haue a medelyng in Italy: wherefore with greate gladnes and
solempnitie he entered into the league, and sware to kepe it, and gaue to

the Ambassadors greate rewardes.
               
                   The first article of this league was that themperor, the kyng of Englande,
and all other kynges and princes, might entre into thesame, and
if the kyng of Englande would, he sould bee admitted as protector of
thesame league.
               But yet the E
                     •
                  perour should not bee admitted, till he had deliuered
the Frenche kynges children, hauyng a reasonable somme of money for
thesame, nor before he had restored the Duke of Millain to his whole
Duchie, franckly and frely, and all other persones of Italy, in like maner
as thei wer before the last warres began: Nor he shal not once come
into Italy for his Coronacion or other wise, but with suche a traine as
the Pope &amp; the Duke of Uenice shall thynke conuenient, and that with
in three monethes after he hath entered into this league, he shall paie to
the kyng of Englande, all suche sommes as he ought hym before ye time
               
                   Item, if themperor would not entre, then thesaid cōfederates should
assemble a greate armie in Italy, accordyng as euery one should bee assessed,
and this armie to be mainteigned, till the Emperors power were
driuen out of Italy.
               
                   Item, that the Emperor shalbe warned, to deliuer the Frēche kynges
children, and to fall to a reasonable poynt with hym, whiche thynges if
he deny to dooe, then the confederates certifie hym, that thei shall neuer
cease till he be brought to reason.
               
                   Item, that a greate nauie should be prepared on all the coastes of Italy
at the common costes of the confederates.
               
                   Item, that Fraunces Sforce shall enioy the Duchie of Millain, payng
yerely to the Frenche kyng fiftie thousande Ducattes, &amp; the French
kyng neuer to claime thesame.
               
                   Item, the Frenche Kyng or the Duke of Orleaunce hys sonne, shall
haue the Countie of As
                     •
                  .
               
                   Item, if he Emperour bee expelled oute of Naples and Scicil, then
the realmes to be at the gift of the Pope, paiyng yerely to the French
kyng lxxv. thousand Ducattes.
               
                   Item, if the kyng of Englande wyll take vpon hym as Protector of
this league, then he or his sonne (the Duke of Richemond) to haue a duchie
or a principalitie in the realme of Naples, to hym &amp; to his heires, to
the somme of thirtie thousande Ducattes at the least, and the Cardinal
of Yorke to haue a yerely pencion of .x. thousand Ducates. This league
was concluded at Cogmace or the .xxii. daie of Maie, in this yere.
               When this League was thus concluded, it was sent to the Kyng of
Englande, whiche with greate deliberacion like a wise prince, consulted
muche with hys counsail of this waightie matter, &amp; whē al thinges wer
fully perceiued, he answered to thambassadours, that he thanked muche
the confederates of their good will, but he would not entre into the league,
because he would be an indifferent entreator betwene bothe parties
and a meane for a peace: and so he wrote to the Emperor, whiche hartely

thanked him, and toke it for greate kyndnes: this league was called the
holy league of Clement. When the Bishop of Rome sawe that this league
was concluded, because he would shewe that he and the confederates,
had iust cause of warre against the Emperor, for thynges doen in Italy,
he sent to hym a letter, dated at Rome the .xxiii. daie of Iune: in the
whiche letter he moste craftely laied to the Emperours charge, what he
had doen for hym before he was Pope, &amp; sithe he was promoted to that
dignitie, he left nothyng vnremembred, that either he had frendly meant
or actualy doen to the Emperor: and accused him of muche vnkyndnes,
and in especiall that he would not pardō Frances Sforce duke of Millain,
at his request. He accused hym also of the coueteous desire which he
had, to haue or obtein the whole Monarchie of Italy, with many other
pretie inuencions: for whiche causes he saied he was compelled, for the

                     •
                  uretie of all Italy, &amp; in especiall for the churche of Rome, to ioyne hymself
with greate Princes, and to make warre for the defence of thesame.
This letter was deliuered to the Emperour with all spede, to whom the
Emperour answered by a letter, dated the .xiiii. daie of September, conteinyng
.xxiiii. shetes of paper, in suche wise that all wise men maie se by
thesame, that the Romishe bishop accused themperour, where he should
haue blamed hymself, for the Emperor laied a greate nomber of ingratitudes
and vntruthes to hym, and clerely auoyded all thynges, that he
laied to his charge. The Pope sent his Ambassador another letter, that
if the first letter were not deliuered, then he should retain it, but as God
would, for manifestyng of the truthe, the letter was deliuered tenne dayes
before.
               After the first letters writtē, the holy father of Rome raised in al hast
an armie of eight thousande footemen, with a valiaunt compaignie of
horsmen, whiche passed the riuer of Poo, and ioyned themselfes with the
power of the Uenicians, wherof was capitain Frances duke of Urbine,
and so thei all together marched toward Millain: and in the meane season
thei had sent Octauian Sforcia Bishop of Aretyne, whiche for the
Frenche kyng should retain .xiiii. M. Swysses, and thei wer commyng
out of Swyserlande, to ioyne with the armie of Italy. Thintent of this
armie was to driue all the Emperors power, out of the Duchie of Millain,
but all their deuises proued cōtrary, as you shall after plainly perceiue.
For you shall vnderstande, that although the Frenche kyng was
taken before Pauia, a yere &amp; more before this tyme, and all the Frenchemen
driuen out of the Duchie of Millain, yet the Emperour left not the
duchie without an armie, for he left there Anthony de Leua, whiche was
capitain of Pauia, at the siege laied by the Frenche Kyng, and Fernando
Daual and Alphons his brethren, two valiant capitaines, but Fernando
died, the more pitie: these capitaines had with them Spaniardes
and Almaines and other, to the nomber of eight or tenne thousande, and
laie still till the newe confederacie set forwarde, and especially thei were
sore moued with Frances Sforce duke of Millain, whiche had the possession
of the moste part of all the fortresses of the duchie, that he would

                  
                     •
                  e one of the cōfederates: wherfore thei thought best to begin with him
and to get the possession out of his hand. Wherefore Alphons Daual
sent for all themperors army together, &amp; thei came al together to warre,
&amp; whē he was there, he sent for Moron chief counsailer with the duke of
Millain, whiche mistrustyng nothing came to him, and there he laied to
him how the Duke his Master was false to the Emperor, and Moron
it denied, then he was kept there as a prisoner, whether it wer by cautele
or no I cannot tel, but he wrote to the Duke, that he perceiued that the
Emperoure was like to preuaile, and aduised hym for auoydyng of al
mistrust, and also to shewe him self the veri frende of the Emperor, and
his obedient subiect, to deliuer all the strong holdes into his captaines
handes: The Duke hearyng this counsaill, and willyng not to haue
the enmitie of the Emperiall capitaines, assented and deliuered to Dauall
all the fortresses that he had, except the castelles of Millain &amp; Cremona,
which he saied he kepte onely for the healthe of his body, because
he had ben long sicke.
               Then Dauall with his powre of Almains &amp; Spaniardes came to y•
citie of Milaine &amp; lodged his people in eueri house, &amp; fearing y• the duke
imagened some thing by kepyng of the two strongest castels, for if he
delyuered those two castelles to the army of the confederates, the Emperoures
capitaynes &amp; people should be in greate daūger, wherfore he
gentlye with greate perswasiō desired to haue the keping of the castell
of Millayn, whiche the duke would in nowise assent, mistrustyng, that
then he shoulde lese the duchie &amp; al, wherefore Daual with al spede
layed sege to the castell, the duke being with in. During ye tyme of thys
sege, the capitaynes euer toke monney &amp; other thinges frō the Citezyns
which sore therat grudged and saied that they wold suffer it no more,
and so as an almaine came to a smith for a docate, the smith cried helpe,
&amp; with that the toune rose: then the capitaynes came into the citie to se
what was done, the souldiers that kepte the sege seyng that, ranne into
the citie and there was much entreting on both partes.
               The duke hering the noies in the citie &amp; seing the besegers gone, came
out of the castel, thinking that his frendes had come to his reskue, but
when he sawe no succour, and harde the noyes seased, he ētred the castell
agayne. When the Capitaines had long intreated the people were
ons cōtēted, but by meanes of one sedicious felowe thei begane again, &amp;
there was a sore fight, but the night cam so faste on that both the partes
seuered them selues.
               The citizens sore greued with the spaniardes saied opēly that shortly
they trus
                     •
                  ed to se all themperours frendes driuē out of Italie, &amp; with
many yll woordes rebuked the souldiais: and when they cam into the
citie thei hurt them.
               Anthony deleua and Dauall, perceiuyng this▪ deuysed how to be revēged,
wherfore in the euenyng they entred with a thousād spaniards &amp;
other, &amp; slewe one citizē &amp; set his hed on a polle &amp; caused it to be borne afore
thē &amp; set, iii. or iiii, houses a 
                     •
                  ire, which whē the citizēs pe
                     •
                  c
                     •
                  iued thei

wer greatly aferd and ran to harnesse, and cast doune stones and barres,
but the hand gonnes shot so fast at them, that thei durst not loke out: the
Almaines set fire in many houses, least thei should haue leyser to fight,
and some of the Spaniardes that kept the towers, slewe the citezens. Alas
the citee was in greate perill, and that wel perceiued Leua and Dauall,
for if the remnant of the Spaniardes had come in, the whole citee
had been burned or vtterly destroyed▪ wherfore thei caused the souldiers
to cease, whiche were content, for thei had been in harnes from the sunne
set, till nyne of the clocke the next daie.
               In this seasō tharmy of the cōfederates, made hast to help the duke of
Millain, &amp; in the meane waie the citee of Lawde was yelded to the duke
of Urbin: Dauall wēt thether wtih a small cōpaignie to reskew the citee
and when he sawe that it was past reskew he returned▪ saiyng: it wer better
to lese Lawde, then Millain, &amp; so brought al his people to Millain.
               The Emperoure from tyme to tyme was aduertised, of all thynges
doen in Italy, wherfore with great diligence he sent the duke of Burbon
thether, with ten saile, and landed at Sauona, &amp; brought with him .x.M.
men, wherof the Millaners wer very glad, &amp; besought him to be good to
thē, to whom he gaue many good wordes &amp; sware, and praied God that
his braynes might be striken out with a gonne, except he did deliuer thē
shortly of their great burden, and oppression of the Spaniardes, so thei
would deliuer hym .xxx.M. ducates, for the wages of the souldiers that
he had brought with hym, whiche wishe was thought to haue happened
to hym at Rome, for breakyng of his promes: for after he had receiued
the money, for a litle space the Millaners wer in good quiet, but shortly
after, thei wer worse then afore, in so muche as some substanciall menne,
for feare of their liues, hanged themselfes.
               Whē the Millaners hard how the citee of Lawde was taken, and the
Spaniardes put out, thei thought that .v.M. Spaniardes and .iii.M
Almaines, and no great nomber of horsemen, beyng without wages and
vitaile, could not defende so great a citee long, against the whole power
of the princes confederate▪ While the power of y• confederates, wer slowly
commyng to Millain ward, the duke and his compaignie lacked victaile,
wherfore of necessitie, when thei sawe the watche negligently kept,
thei sent out of the castle .CC. men, whiche with strength passed the siege,
and came to the armie of the confederates, and shewed them in what case
the castle was in, whiche bad theim bee of a good chere, and so thei marched
forwarde towarde a gate of Millain, called Rome gate, and Ihon
de Medices whiche led the forward, shot sixe gonnes at a tower to haue
ouerthrowen thesame, and so to haue entered in by that waie. The
Emperors men came to the place, and not onely defended thesame, but
valiantly set forward to fight with their enemies, and skirmished with
them very sore. The Italians seyng that the Spaniardes wer so fierce.
thought it not best to fight with them, but to tary till the Swysses were
come, and then thei thought thēselfes sure of victorie: and so with shame

inough, thei returned to Meligia.
               After his returne, the Imperialles fortified the citee in many places.
The duke of Millein seyng that he lacked victaile, and that his succors
had failed him, sent to the duke of Burbon worde, that he would deliuer
the castle, so that he should be bound to no farther inconuenience: so thei
agreed that he and his, should haue their bagge &amp; baggage, and should
haue the citee of Come for his abode til he wer tried of themperor, of the
accusacions against hym alleged:The castle of Millain yelded to thempeours vse. vpon whiche condicion he yelded the
castle, &amp; went directly to tharmy of the confederates. And after ye he went
to Come, accordyng to his appoyntment: but the Spaniardes whiche
kepte the toune, would not suffre hym to entre, wherefore of necessitie he
was compelled to returne, to tharmy of the confederates, &amp; there became
enemie to themperors meny Al this Sommer tharmie of Italy gat nothyng,
but the citee of Lawde, and thei durste not fight with the Spanyardes,
wherfore thei went &amp; besieged Cremona, in the whiche wer .i.M
Almaines, and .v.C. Spanyardes. All the Swisshes and .viii.M of the
Popes men, &amp; all the horsemen of Malatesta, wer sent to the siege, wherof
was capitain ye said Malatesta Ballio Perusine, whiche, as he would
haue entered the castle was salin, and .i.M. men and more of his bende:
wherfore the duke of Urbyne, and the whole army of the Uenicians wer
sent for, whiche made so greate a nomber, and had suche ordinance, that
thei within began to treate, and by appoyntment deliuered the citee.
               After this, the whole army of the Italia
                     •
                  s or confederates, determ
                     •
                  
                  ned
clerely to besiege Millain, but sodainly the bishop of Rome sent for
his army (for what cause you shal here after) and also thei hard say, that
George Fronsberge a valiant capitain an Almain, which serued thēperor
in his last warres: was cōmyng with .x
                     •
                  ii.M. Lanceknightes, which
wer paied their wages afore hand, for .iiii. monethes, to aide themperors
part When the confederate army hard this, thei wer astonied, and durst
not enterprise the siege, but at a certain Abbay, twoo mile frō the citee of
Millain, thei made a fortificacion for .iii.M. fotemen, and fiue hundred
horsemen, to lye surely all wynter, to suffre no recourse to come to the citee,
whiche citee was all this Sōmer season well fortified and victaled.
               After the Popes army was departed at Cremona, as you haue hard,
there came to tharmy of the confederates. Michael Anthonio Marques
of Saluce▪ as capitain generall for the Frēche kyng, and brought with
hym .iii.M. Eascons, and .v.C. men of armes, and, xv.C. light horses,
accordyng to the league. Then this whole army hearyng that y• Almaines
wer commyng forward, with greate ordinance, and a greate nomber
of horsmen, and had passed the straightes of the mountaignes maugre
the Uenicians, and that Couradine Lepontine, whiche had deliuered vp
Cremona with .i.M. Almaines, was ioyned with capitain George. Whē
tharmy of the confederates wer well informed of this greate armie that
was cōming toward Millain, the capitaines clerely determined to mete
with thē, and by battaill or otherwise, to let them from passyng the riuer

of Poo, or to ioyne with themperors armie, wherefore thei marched forwarde,
and founde that the Almaynes were come into the territories of
Mantua: then the duke of Urbyn, &amp; Ihon de Medi
                     •
                  s cosin to the Pope
thought to wery the Almaines with light skirmishes, but Ihon de Medi
                     ••
                  s
skirmished so nere tharmie, to get him a name aboue other, that he
was hit with a gonne, and so shortely died. Then the Almaines came to
Florenciola and there toke counsaill, &amp; thought it not best to soiorne all
wynter in the Duchie of Millain, because al thyng there was scace, by
reason of the continuall warres: wherefore thei determined to take the
Popes tounes, as aucthor of all the mischief and warre, and surely thei
had taken the toune of Plesance, if tharmie of the confederates had not
strongly, bothe with men and artilery, fortified the toune.
               While all these thynges wer a doyng, there continued a greate hatered
betwene the bishop of Rome, &amp; the noble famely of Colume in Rome
all whiche famely was Imperiall, in so muche that the Bishop saied to
Pompey Cardinal of Colume, that he would take awaie his Cardinalles
hat,An answer of a Cardinal to the Bishop of Rome, and thother answered if he did so, that he would put on a helmet
to ouerthrowe his thre crounes. When this malice had long continued,
the Bishop of Rome began to lacke money, to maintein his warres, and
sore he fered the Columes his domesticall enemies, &amp; so of his awne mocion
began to breake the matter with Ascayn Colume, sonne to Prosper
de Columna, in name of the whole bloud of the Columes, saiyng: that it
wer more conuenient for bothe parties to agree, then to abide the chaūce
of battaill, to the whiche thei bothe were parties (for the Columes had
men of warre in themperors battaill, as the bishop had in tharmy of the
confederates) then euery daie to retain souldiers at home eche for feare
of other, to their greate charges and losse. Ascaine hearyng this, saied he
would speake with his kynred, and so did: and this communicacion had
takē effect, and Hugo de Moncado had not been. For this Hugo was a
litle before sent from themperor to the Pope, with certain articles to cō
                  clude
a peace, to the whiche the Pope would not agre, saiyng he came to
late, &amp; when he sawe the bishops proude answer, &amp; perceiued him enemie
to his master, he then sought an occasion, to oppresse the bishop &amp; his power,
and so moued the Cardinall of Colume, and Ascain Colume, to inuade
Rome with a sodain fraie, &amp; to take Pope Clement or he wer ware.
               Thei beyng glad to please themperor, gathererd secretly .ii.M. souldiers,
and entered Rome with suche spede, that thei wet at. S. Ihon Laterēce
nere to the Popes Palace, or any man spied theim, then began a crie, the
Cardinall of Colume cōmeth with a great power. The Pope thynkyng
it to late to sende for aide, fled by a secret vaw
                     •
                  e to the castle Angell, and
with hym fled Cardinalles, Bishoppes, &amp; other of his palace, to a great
nomber, so that there was not victaile inough, for theim all. The bishop
Clement sawe that shortly he and thei, should be famished in the castle,
sent to Hugo de Moncado, whiche had declared that he was thauctor
of this act, not mindyng to hurt the Pope, but to make hym themperors

frend, or els to cause hym to surcesse, for doyng themperor any damage,
and to thesaid Hugo he offered, to kepe peace with the Emperor and his
confederates for foure monethes, &amp; in the meane season to treate a peace,
and also to call his armie again ouer the Poo, and for the performance
of this, he deliuered to the Columes good hostage, and returned his armie
from Cremona, as you haue hard before, and so he was deliuered at
large: Now will I leaue the Emperors armie liyng in Italy, and speke
of a greate mischief that fell in Hongary.
               The greate Turke Sultan Soliman Pac, hearyng of the strie
                     •
                   and
warre that was betwene Christen princes, imagened that his tyme was
come, to do some greate act in Christendō, wher
                     •
                  ore he assembled a puissant
armie of .C.xx.M. men, and entered into Hungary, sore destroiyng
the countrey. Wherof hearyng Lewes kyng of Hongary, a couragious
knight of .xxvi. yere of age, with a small nomber marched forwarde in
Iune, and was on the great army of the Turkes or he wist, and so with
good corage ioyned battaill, but he was oppressed with multitude, and
was compelled to flie into a marreis, where he horse &amp; man wer drouned
and many other with hym, his body was found after &amp; buried. The saiyng
was that he was betraied, by an Erle of his awne, called Ihon de
Uoada, &amp; so it was likely, for the Turke afterwarde made hym kyng of
Hongary,The Kyng of Hōgary slain but he enioyed but one part of it called Trāsiluan
                     •
                  a: for Fernando
themperors brother, whiche had maried the sister &amp; heire of kyng
Lewes ye was slain, kept the chief part of Hongary. The greate Turke
hymself was not at the fight, but when he hard that the kyng was slain,
he reioysed muche, &amp; spoyled the countrey, &amp; brought many a Christian
soule into captiuitie to Turkey. Of this victory he wrote to the Uenicians,
as to his frendes, whiche letter was red openly in Uenice, before
Doctor Pace Ambassador there for the kyng of Englande, but whether
thei wer ioyous or sorowfull of the tidynges, I cannot well tell you.
               This sōmer was great grudge against merchant strangers in Lōdō
in somuch ye if ye matter had not been well pacified, much busines might
haue folowed, the cause of the grudge was this, ther was an act made in
the .iiii. yere of kyng Henry, ye no stranger should bryng in no wyne nor
woade in an aliens ship: so ye thenglishmen after ye went to Tholose, and
brought much woade to London, &amp; serued al the clothiers repairyng to
London: &amp; now in this yere by meanes of gentlemen about the king, the

                     ••
                  rangers had license to bryng in woade in strāgers bottomes, so that al
Lōdon was ful of their woade, &amp; also thei sent their woade into the coū
                  trey,
so ye thenglishmennes woade in Londō lay vnbought: wherfore sir
Ihō Alen knight beyng Maior, sent for a great sort of strangers, which
wer the chief merchantes of all, &amp; shewed vnto thē what gaines thei had
gotten in the citee, by reason wherof thei should auaunce the citee, &amp; not
hurt it, wherfore he willed thē to sel their woade to the merchātes of Lō
                  don,
&amp; thei should be paied in continent, &amp; not to resort to other places in

ye, called a cōmen counsaill in the moneth of August, and there wer
many billes laied against the strangers, &amp; at last it was enacted, that no

               This yere on Michaelmas euen, Thomas Hynd whiche was chosen
shrife before, was called to take his oth, but he made defaute, wherefore
on Sunō Rice was chosen which refused, then was one George Robinson
Mercer chosen, whiche toke his oth not to be able. The cōmons wer

for ye yere, seyng this discord, said to the cōmōs, masters, although

England, wherof hearyng thenglishe merchantes, whiche lay in Spain
at diuerse portes, cōcluded to sende to doctor Edward Lee, Ambassador

would haue hym, for he laboreth to make a vniuersall peace, whiche he
could not conuenlently do, if he wer protector or a cōtractor in y• league,
this answere he sent to theim from Granado, the .v. daie of September.
               In the moneth of December, the kyng kept a solempne Christmas, at
his Manor of Grenewiche, with greate plētie of victaile, Reuels, Maskes,
disguysynges, and bankettes: and the .xxx. daie of December, was
an enterprise of Iustes made at the tilt by sixe gentlemen, against al cō
                  mers,
whiche valiantly furnished thesame, bothe with spere and sworde,
and like Iustes wer kept the third daie of Ianuary, where were .CCC.
speres broken. That same night, the kyng and many young gentlemen
with hym, came to Bridewell, &amp; there put hym, and .xv. other, al in Maskyng
apparell, and then toke his Barge, and towed to the Cardinalles
place, where wer at supper a great compaignie of lordes and ladies, and
then the Maskers daūced, and made goodly pastyme, and whē thei had
well danced, the Ladies plucked awaie their visors, and so thei were all
knowen and to the kyng was made a greate banket.
               The .xiii. daie of Ianuary came to the court, Don Hugo de Mendosa,
a greate man borne in Spain, of a noble famely, this persone was se

commission, for themperor put it to the kyng of Englandes determinacion,
whether his demaundes whiche he required of the Frenche Kyng,
wer reasonable or not, and for the declaracion thereof, and for to knowe
the kyng of Englandes request and entreatie concerning the peace, was
this noble man sent into Englande, whiche many tymes consulted with
the kyng and his counsaill, and he taried here twoo yeres full.
               This Christmas was a goodly disguisyng plaied at Greis inne,A plaie at Grayes inne. whiche
was compiled for the moste part, by master Ihon Roo, seriant at the
law .xx. yere past, and long before the Cardinall had any aucthoritie, the
effecte of the plaie was, that lorde gouernance was ruled by dissipacion
and negligence, by whose misgouernance and euill order, lady Publike
wele was put from gouernance: which caused Rumor Populi, Inward
grudge and disdain of wanton souereignetie, to rise with a greate multitude,
to expell negligence and dissipacion, and to restore Publik welth
again to her estate, which was so doen. This plaie was so set furth with
riche and costly apparel, with straunge diuises of Maskes &amp; morrishes
that it was highly praised of all menne, sauyng of the Cardinall, whiche
imagined that the plaie had been diuised of hym, &amp; in a greate furie sent
for thesaied master Roo, and toke from hym his Coyfe, and sent hym to
the Flete, &amp; after he sent for the yong gentlemen, that plaied in the plaie,
and them highly rebuked and thretened, &amp; sen
                     •
                   one of them called Thomas
Moyle of Kent to the Flete, but by the meanes of frendes Master
Roo and he wer deliuered at last. This plaie sore displeased the Cardinall,
and yet it was neuer meante to hym, as you haue harde, wherfore
many wisemen grudged to see hym take it so hartely, and euer the Cardinall
saied that the kyng was highly displeased with it, and spake nothyng

of hymself.
               In this yere the second day of Marche wer receiued to London,Ambassadore frō the Frenche Kyng with
a great compaignie of noble men, the bishop of Tarbe Frances visoūt
of Toraine, &amp; master Anthony Uescy, secōd president of Paris, as Ambassadors
from the Frenche kyng, &amp; so brought through London to the
Tailers hall and there lodged, and afterward wer cōueighed to Grenewiche
to the kyng, where thei wer right haitely enterteined, &amp; after their
letters red &amp; their requestes haro, thei departed for a season to London.

strange fashion that had not been seen, and with hym .viii. gentlemen all
in cloth of golde of one suite, embrodered with knottes of siluer, and the
Marques of Excester, and .viii. with hym in blewe veluet and white saten,
like the waues of the sea, these men of armes came to the tilte, &amp; there
ran many freshe courses, till .cc.lxxxvi. speres wer broken▪ and then thei
disarmed and wēt to the quenes chamber, where for them was prouided
a costly banket.
               The Frēche Ambassadors hauyng their recourse to the kyng and his
counsaill, muche labored to haue in mariage the Lady Mary daughter
to the kyng▪ and after long counsailyng, that matter was put in suspēce
because the president of Paris, doubted whether the mariage betwene
the kyng &amp; her mother, beyng his brothers wife were good or no: of this
first mocion grewe muche busines or it wer ended, as you shall here, afterward.
The common people repugned sore against that demaund, for
thei said that she was heire apparant to her father, and if he should dye,
thei would haue no Frencheman to be kyng of Englande, and thus the
common people spake, as their myndes serued them.
               While the Frenche Ambassadours laie thus in London, it happened
one euenyng as thei wer commyng from the blacke Friers, from supper
to the Tailers hall, two boyes wer in a gutter castyng doune rubbishe,
whiche the rain had driuen there, and vnware hit a lackay belonging to
the viscount of Tourain, and hurte hym nothyng, for scantly touched it
his cote, but the Frenche lordes toke the matter highly, as a thyng doen
in dispite, and sent worde to the Cardinal, whiche beyng to hastie of credence,
sent for sir Thomas Seimer knight, lord Maior of the citee, and
in all hast commaunded hym vpon his allegeance, to take the husband,
wife, children and seruauntes of the house, and theim to emprison, till he
knewe farther of the kinges pleasure, and that the .ii. boyes apprentices
should be sent to the Tower, whiche cōmaundement was accomplished
without any fauor: For the man and his wife, and seruauntes, wer kept
in the Counter till the sixt daie of Maie, whiche was sixe wekes ful, and
their neighbours of gentlenes kepte their house in the meane tyme, and
one of the apprētices died in the Tower, and the other was almost lame:
of the crueltie of the Cardinall, &amp; of the pride of the Frenchemen, muche
people spake, and would haue been reuenged on the Frenchemen, if wisemen
in the citee had not appeased it with faire wordes.

Erle of Ottonbrough, Ihon Burgraue of Siluerberge, and Ihon
Faber a famous clerke after bishop of Uien, as Ambassadors frō Don
Fernando, brother to the Emperor, newly electe kyng of Hungarye and
Beame, after the death of his brother in lawe kyng Lewes, whiche was
slain by the Turke the last Sommer, as you haue hard before: this compaignie
was welcomed of the high Officers, and after brought into the
kynges presence, all the nobilitie beyng present, and there after great reuerence
made,An Oracion made by Master Faber. thesaied Clerke Master Faber made a notable Oracion,
takyng his ground of the Gospell, Exiit seminare semen suum, and of that he declared
how Christe and his disciples went furthe to sowe, and how their
sede was good that fell into the good ground, and brought furth good
fruite, whiche was the Christen faithe: and then he declared how contrary
to that sowyng, Machomete had sowen seede, whiche brought furthe
the euil sede, and shewed from the beginnyng, how the Turkes haue encresed
in power, what realmes thei had conquered, what people thei had
subdued euen to that daie: he declared farther what actes ye great Turk
then liuyng had doen, and in especial he noted the gettyng of Belgrade,
and of the Rhodes, and the slaiyng of the kyng of Hungary, to the great
rebuke (as he said) of al the kynges christened: he set furth also what power
the Turke had, what diuersities of cōpaignies, what armure, what
capitaines he had, so that he thought, that without a marueilous great
nomber of people, he could not be ouerthrowē: Wherfore he moste humbly
beseched the kyng, as Sainct Georges knight, and defender of the
faithe, to assist the kyng his Master, in that Godly warre and verteous
purpose To this oracion the kyng,The answere by the mouthe of sir Thomas More
answered, that muche he lamented the losse that happened in Hongarie,
and if it wer not for the warres, whiche wer betwene the two great princes,
he thought that the Turke would not haue enterprised that acte,
wherfore he with al his studie would take pain, first, to set an vnitie and
peace throughout all Christendom, and after that he bothe with money
and men, would be ready to helpe toward that glorious warre, asmuche
as any other prince in Christendom. After this doen the Ambassadours
were well cherished, and diuerse tymes resorted to the Courte, and had
greate chere and good rewardes, and so the third daie of Maie next ensuyng,
thei toke their leaue and departed homeward.
               This season the fame went,Themperors letter to the Frēche kyng. that themperor had written to the French
kyng, admonishyng hym to regarde his othe and promes toward God,
and his honor and fame toward the worlde, allegyng that if he kept his
promise towarde hym, that he should finde hym suche a frende, that all
Fraunce should reioyse of it, &amp; if he would not kepe his former promes,
whiche he made and sware at Madrill, he toke God to witnesse, that he
would neuer leaue the warre, til fire and sworde had brought hym to accomplishe
his promes, or els to driue hym out of his realme &amp; dominiōs

wyth strength and puissaunce, which letter the French kyng nothyng regarded
saiyng that the Emperoure the nexte yere shoulde haue warre
inough.
               The fame went and letters came to London, that the Emperoures
army in Italy the xii. day of April had met with the Uenicians as they
were goyng homewarde, and that betwene them there was a cruell
fyght &amp; by fyne force the Uenicians were put to 
                     •
                  lyght, &amp; no maruell as
the Uenicyans answere, for they sai that by cause ther was a peace concluded
for six monethes betwene the byshop of Rome, and Hugo Demountcado,
and that the viceroy of Naples was come to Rome to cō
                  ferme
the same truce, therfore they sent their ordinaūce and harnes and
loked for no war, but only taried together tyl they wer payed there wages,
and so vnprouided they were set on and ouercome.
               In the end of this yere the people were sore troubled with pouertye
for the greate paymentes of money that were past, and also in wynter
in the seade season fell such abound ans of rayne in Septēbre, Nouembre
&amp; Decembre, and on the xvi daie of Ianiuer fell suche a great rayne
that there of ensued greate fluddes whiche distroyed corne, feldes, and
pastures: and drouned many shepe and beastes: then was it dry tyll the
xii day of Aprill and from thence it rayned euery day or nyght tyll the
third day of Iune, and in May it rayned, xxx. houres contynually with

               The .xix, yere,
               
                  THis time a bill was set vp in Londō muche contrary to the honor
of the Cardinall, in the whiche the Cardinall was warned
that he should not counsaile the king to mary his daughter in
to Fraunce, for if he did, he shoulde shewe hym selfe enemy to
the kyng and the Realme with many threatnyng wordes: thys bill
was delyuered to the Cardinall by sir Thomas Seimer Maior of the
citie, which thanked him for the same, &amp; made much serch for the author
of that bill, but he coulde not be founde, whiche sore displeased the Cardinall,
&amp; vpō this occasiō the last day of April at night he caused a great
watch to be kept at Westminster &amp; had there cart gonnes read
                     •

which watches were kept by gentelmē &amp; their seruaūtes, with householders
&amp; al for feare of y• Lōdoners bicause of this bil. Whē y• citizēs
knew of this, thei saied that thei marueiled whi the Cardinal hated thē so
for thei saied that if he mistrusted thē, he loued not them, &amp; where loue is
not, there is hatred, &amp; thei affirmed that thei neuer entēded no harme toward
him, &amp; mused of this chaūce, for if .v. or .vi. lewde persones had
made Alarme in the citie, thē had ētred all these watche mē with there
trayne which might haue spoiled the citie without cause, wherfore they
much murmured against the Cardinall &amp; his vndiscrete doinges.

opēly the bishop of Terby gaue to the kyng hartie thākes for the great
fauor he showed to the kyng his master, in the tyme of his visitacion (as
he called it) that is to were when he was in prisō, for he said the kyng by
his mercy had conquered the whole hartes of the realme which he could
not do by strēgth. Thēbassadors also desired as you haue harde, the mariage
of the lady Mary for the duke of Orleance .ii. sonne to the French
Kyng. Some said she was mete for him 
                     •
                  elf: but many a man marueled
why she was denayed for the secōd sonne, seyng that in the .x. yere of this
kyng it was cōcluded that she should mary the Dolphin beyng the first
sonne: but this demaund was not concluded nor answered but deferred
because of her tendre age, tyll another tyme. For the more enterteinyng
of the French ambassadors the king caused a solēpne Iustes to be doen
by sir Nicholas Carew, sir Robert Iernyngham, sir Anthony Broune,
and Nicholas Haruy, the valiaunt esquier as chalengers: whiche were
appareled in bases and bardes all of one suite, the right side was ryche
tyssue embaudered with a compasse or roundell of blacke veluet and in
the compas a ryght hand holdyng a sworde, and a boute the sword were
pennes and peces of money of diuerse coynes, all embrawdered, vnder
the hand was embraudered Loialte, and on that side of the bard was written
in embraudery, Bi pen, pain nor treasure, truth shall not be violated. The otherside
of the bases and bardes were of cloth of gold and cloth of siluer. When
these foure chalengars were come to the tilt, then entered the Marques
of Excester and .xiii. with hym all armed and barded and based of one
suit: that is to saie, the right sides cloth of golde cut in cloudes engrayled
with Damaske golde, the otherside cloth of syluer set with mountaynes
full of Oliue braunches, made of gold all mouyng. These men
of armes ranne many a faire course with little missyng, for with in twoo
houres and a half, notwithstandyng that yt rained apace, thei brake .iii
hundreth speres at the least, and when nyght approched they disarmed
and went to the courte.
               The kyng agaynst that night had caused a banket house to bee made
on the one syde of the tylt yarde at Grenewyche of an hundreth foote of

the Arches were vawted with Armorie, all of Bice and golde, &amp; aboue

vessel of gold: to reherse the fare, the straūgenes of dishes, with deuises
of beastes &amp; fowles it were to long, wherefore I will let passe ouer the
supper with songes &amp; minstrelsie. Whē supper was done, the kyng, the
quene and the ambassadors washed, and after talked at their pleasure
and then thei rose and went out of the banket chambre by the forsaied
Arches, &amp; when thei were betwene the vttermoste dore and the Arches

rofe of this chambre was conninglie made by the kynges Astronimer,
for on the grounde of the rofe, was made the hole earth enuironed with
the Sea, like a very Mappe or Carte, and by a conning makyng of a

girdelles and the two poles apered on the earth and water compassing

the same, and in the zodiak were the twelue signes, curiously made, and
aboue this were made the seuen planettes, as Mars, Iupiter, Sol,
Mercurius, Venus, Saturnus, and Luna, euery one in their proper
houses, made accordyng to their properties, that it was a connyng
thing and a plesant syght to be holde.
               When the kyng and the quene, were set vnder their clothes of estate
which were rich and goodly, and the ambassadours set on the righte side
of the chambre, then entred a person clothed in cloth of golde, and ouer
that mantell of blew silke, full of eyes of golde, and ouer his hed a cap

kynges of the same Realmes geuyng greate praise to the kyng of England
for graunting of peace, and also to the Frenche kyng for suyng for
thesame, and also to the Cardinal for beyng a mediator in thesame: and
when he had doen, then entred eight of the kynges Chappel with a song
and brought with theim one richly appareled: and in likewise at the other

theffect wherof was whether riches were better thē loue, and when they
could not agre vpon a conclusion, eche called in thre knightes, all armed,

of the chambre, &amp; the other iii resisted, &amp; sodēly betwene the six knightes,The fight at barriars
out of the Arche fell doune a bar all gilte, at the whiche barre the sir
kinghtes fought a fair battail, and then thei were departed, and so went
out of the place: then came in an olde man with a siluer berd, and he concluded
that loue &amp; riches, both be necessarie for princes (that is to saie)
by loue to be obeied and serued, and with riches 
                     •
                  o rewarde his louers

for afortresse, &amp; al the mount was set ful of Christal coralles, &amp; rich
rockes of rubie cureously conterfaited &amp; full of roses &amp; pomgranates
as though thei grewe: on this rocke sat eight Lordes appareled in cloth
of Tissue &amp; siluer cut in quater foyles,Maskers the gold engrailed with siluer,
and the siluer with gold, al loose on white satin, and on ther heddes cappes
of blake veluet set with perle and stone, thei had also mantelles of

Lordes of the mount, and as thei daunced, sodenly entred sixe personages,

there heddes with tippetes of cloth of gold▪ there garmentes were long
after the fashion of Ireland, and these persones had visers with syluer
berdes, so that thei were not knowne: these Maskers tooke Ladies and
daunsed lustely about the place,
               Then sodenly the kyng and the viscount of Torayne were conueighed
out of the place into a chambre thereby, &amp; there quicklie thei .ii. and
six other in maskyng apparel of cloth of gold and purple tinsell sattin,
greate, lōg, &amp; large, after the Uenicians fashiō &amp; ouer them great robes,

that the kyng hym self ware &amp; also the apparel that the viscount hym selfe
masked in, which were very riche, for the whiche he thanked hym.
               Then the kyng quene and the ambassadours, returned to the banket
chamber, where thei found a banked ready set on the borde, of so many &amp;
marueilous dishes, that it was wonder to se, then the kyng sat doune
and there was ioy, myrth and melody: and after that all was doen the
kyng and all other went to rest, for the night was spent, and the day euen
at the breakyng.
               The morowe after the ambassadours toke there leaue of the kyng,
and had greate rewardes geuen them and so came to London, and ther
rested two dayes and so departed in hast homeward.
               These two houses with Cupbordes, hāgynges and al other thinges
the kyng commaunded should stand still, for thre or foure daies, that al
honest persones might see and beholde the houses &amp; riches, and thether
came a great nombre of people, to see &amp; behold y• riches &amp; costely deuices
               After that the ambassadours of Fraunce were departed the kyng sēt
an other ambassade into Fraūce (that is to say) Sir Thomas Boleyne
knight, viscoūt of Rochforth, and Sir Anthony Broune knight, which
came to Paris to the bishop of Bathe, whiche lay in Fraunce as ambassadour
for the kyng of Englād, and then these thre went to the court
and saw the Frenche kyng in persone swere to kepe the league &amp; amitie
concluded betwene hym and the kyng of Englande, and there thei had
greate chere and maskes shewed vnto them, but litle rewardes were geuen,
&amp; so y• viscount Rochforth retorned into Englād, &amp; so did the bishop
of Bathe shortly after, leauyng sir Anthony Broūe behind for a ligier.
               In this moneth of Maie y• .x. day the kyng sent sir Fraūces Poynes
knight,An ambassad sent to themperour▪
                   as ābassadour frō y• kyng of Englād, to Charles themperor &amp;

the treasure &amp; ordinaūce which was takē at Pauia, for somuch as that
warr, was made as well at the kynges charge, as themperors charge: he
demaunded also the duke of Orleaūce, to be deliuered to him, &amp; also it
was demaūded that themperour should deliuer y• bishop of Rome which
was takē this moneth as you shal here, and also should bring his armie
out of Italy, and if he refused to do any of these poinctes, then Clarēseauxin
the kynges name of Englande should make to him defiaunce.
               When it was knowen that warr like to be betwene the Emperour
and the kyng of England, the commons of England sore lamentyd
the chaūce, for all marchandise were rest rayned to passe in to any of
themperours dominiōs, &amp; he marchaūtes wer desired by the Cardinal
to kepe ther martes at Caleis, to the which in nowise thei would assenf.
               This same moneth the kyng sent two fayre shippes, well manned
and vitailed, hauing in them diuers connyng men, to seke strange regions:Shippes sēt to seke straūg Rigions.

               The .xxii. day of May cam in post to the kyng out of Fraunce the bishop
of Tarbie, whiche was here in the beginnyng of this moneth, this
bishop brought to the kyng of England, the articles which the Frenche
kyng now offered to the Emperour, which wer contrarie to the articles
sworne at Madryll in the .xvii. yere of the kyng, and farther he moued
the kyng of Englande to be enemy to themperour, which request (as well
men say) was muche furtherd by the Cadinall, because of the warres in
Italie, betwene the Pope &amp; thēperour: this bishop made short tariyng

which all y• last winter liued ingreat pouertie, with our clothes, victaile
or wages, so that thei were in maner desperat, &amp; so went toward Parme
&amp; Bononie, belongyng to the Sea of Rome. The bishop of Rome hearyng
this sēt a messenger to the duke to redeme the Popes townes, so
that thei shoulde not be spoyled nor hurte: the duke and the capitaine
axed thre hundreth &amp; fiftie thowsād Ducates, for sauyng of the Popes
lād, &amp; if thei might haue so much money, thei would depart to Naples:
but when thei sawe that thei coulde haue no money, they with all spede
turned toward Florence the .xxii. of Aprill, whereof hearyng the Romaines
thei wer glad, for thei thought that the Florentines wold hold
good war with them, &amp; thā the Pope &amp; the Romaines woulde geue the
lokyng on: but the chaūse turned, as you shall here after.
               For a suertie the duke of Burbon thought to haue gon to Florence
for this cause, for ther was a gentlemā in Florence called Peter de saluiata
which had a brother that serued themperor in his warres, which
promised to deliuer y• citie, for he determined to cause the commons
to rebell in y• citie gaynst the heddes, &amp; in the meane seasō y• dukes cō

Armye was come to a place called Le Chase, within twelue myle
of the Citie, to bryng his purpose to a conclusyon, he with suche as he
had trayned to him, cryed in the Citie: Liber
                        •
                     ate de populo, that is in English
Lybertie of the people: with which voyce the people styrred and came
to the Palace in great nombre, and there they tooke the .vi. Lordes of
the counsell which had the rule of the Publyke welthe of the Citie (as
they call it) and slew one of them: The Familie of Medices, whiche
were the Popes kynred, were at this tyme sore a fraied. Thus this Peter
de Saluiota, with the Commons gate the Palace and rang the cōmen bell.
In this season was in Florence a Capitayn of the Frenche kynges called
Frederico de Bodsoo, he had with hym .iii.C. men: and when he saw this
rebellyon, he came to the Commons and sayde: Syrs, if you continew
in this case, your fayre Citie is lyke to be subuerted, for your enemyes
be at hande: which notwithstandynge that you beare some fauoure to
themperour as appeareth, yet their needinesse and pouertie is soch, that
without mercy thei wyll robbe, 
                     〈◊〉
                   and sley you, your wyfes &amp; chyldren,
and sette fyer on your beautifull Citie.
               This Capitayne moche steyed the Citie, notwithstandyng that .xx. or
more persones were sleyne in the ruffle, yet they were well auoyded, and
sodeyngly entered into the Citie the Duke of Urbyne, which lay but .vi.
myle from Florence, and .xviii. myle from themperours armye whom he
had coasted, but he thought no aduauntage to medle. This Duke
brought with hym▪ v.M. footemen, and .vi.C, horsemen, and when he
was entered the Citie, a crye was made that all thynges was pardoned,
so that euery man departed home and delyuered his weapon, whiche
was dooen: and thus the Citie was appeased, the .xxviii. day of Apryll.
               All this doyng within the Citie was vnknowne to themperours armye,
for it was beyonne and ended in .iiii. or .v. houres, and so for lacke
of knowledge, this enterprise was lost, which was happye for the Florentynes.
Sore displeased were themperours Capitaynes when they
knew of this channce, and also how the Duke of Urbyne was entered
into the Citie of Florence for their defence, but thei coulde not doo with
all. And so shortly thei departed and came to the Citie of Seynes .xxx.
myle of, and there they lost their great ordynaunce, and tooke counsell
to go to Rome (notwithstandynge the trewce concluded betwene the
Pope and the Uiceroy of Naples, &amp; Hugo de Moncada, as you haue
hearde) and so moche they traucyled by nyghtes and dayes, commenly
passyng .xl, myle, day and nyght (Their good wyll was soche) that the
vi. daye of Maie, with banners displaied, they came before the Citie
of Rome beynge saturdaye the some day: and sonday the Romaynes
made Bulwarkes, Rampiers, and other defences, and layde ordynaūce
on the walles, and shot at them without fearcely.
               The Duke of Burbon determyned that it were not best to lye styll
without,Rome assauted. and be slayne with ordinaunce, consideryng that they were all
naked people, and without great ordinaunce: wherfore he determined

to take the chaunce &amp; to geue the assaute, &amp; so manfully they approched
the walles betwene the Burgo nouo &amp; olde Rome. But the Romayns
valiauntly defended them with handgn̄nes, pykes, stones, &amp; other weapons,
so that the enemyes were fayne to retreyte. Then the Romaynes
were glad, &amp; sette many faire banners on their Towers &amp; Bulwarkes,
and made great showtes: Which seeynge the Duke of Burbon cryed
to a new assaute. Then the Drumslades blew, &amp; euery mā with a ladder
mounted: &amp; at the 
                     •
                  yrst encoūter, agayn the Romayns put them a lytel
backe: Which perceiuīg, the duke of Burbō cryed: God &amp; themperour.
Then euery man manfully sette on, there was a sore fyght, many an
arrow shot, &amp; many a man felled: but at the last the Emperours men
gotte the wall: &amp; betwene euery assaute fell a myst, so that they within
coulde not see what parte they without would assayle, which was profitable
to themperours partie: At the three assautes were sleyne .iii.C.
Swyshes of the Popes Garde In this last assaute was the Duke of
Burbon stryken in the thygh with a handgōne,The Duke of Burbon sleyn, of the which he shortly
dyed in a chapell of s. Syst, whyther his Souldiers had brought him▪
And this chaunce notwithstandynge the Armye entered into Rome, &amp;
toke the Popes Palace &amp; set vp themperours Armes. The same day
that these three assautes were made, Pope Clement passed lytell on the
Emperours Armye:
                     
                        •
                     urse of the Pope. for he had accursed theim on the saturday before,
and in his curse he called the Almaynes Lutheranes, &amp; the Spaniards
Murreynes or mores: and when he was hearyng of masse, sodeinly the
Almaynes entered the Churche, &amp; slew his Garde &amp; dyuerse other. He
seeyng that, fled in all haste by a preuye way to the Castell s. Angell: &amp; al
they that followed hym that way &amp; coulde not entre, were sleyne, and if
he in that fury had ben taken, he had ben sleine. The Cardinals &amp; other
prelates fled to the castel of s. Angel, ouer the bridge, where many of the
commen people were ouerpr
                     •
                  ssed and drowned as thei gaue way to the
Cardinalles &amp; other estates that passed towarde the castell for succour.
               The Cardinall of Senes, of Sesaryne, of Tudertine, of Iacobace
&amp; of the Ualle, taryed so long, that they coulde not get to the castell for
multitude of people: wherefore they were compelled to take a nother
house, called the Palace of s. George, where they kepte theym selfe for a
whyle, as secretely as thei myngt. You must vnderstand, that thorough
the Citie of Rome, ronneth a famouse Ryuer, called Tyber: and on the
one syde of the Ryuer standeth the Castell s. Angell, or the Borough of
s, Angell: &amp; the other side is called Burgo Nouo, or the New Borough.
This Brydge is called, the Brydge of Syxte, which lyeth directly before
the Castell. At the ende of this Brydge was a wonderous strong
Bulwarke, well Ordinaunced &amp; well manned. The Emperours men
saw that they coulde doo nothynge to the Pope nor to that porte of the
Citie but by the bridge, determyned to assaute the Bulwarke: &amp; so as
men without feare, came on the bridge: &amp; the Romayns so well defended
them, that they slew almost .iiii.M. men. That seeyng the Prince of Orenge,

&amp; the Marques of Gnasto, with all spede gaue assaute, and notwithstandyng
that the Romaynes shot great ordinaūces, handgonnes
quarrels, &amp; all that myght be shot: yet the Imperiall persones neuer
shranke, but manly entered the Bulwarke &amp; slew &amp; threw downe out at
the loupes all the Romains that thei found, &amp; after rased the bulwarke
to the grounde. The Pope was in the Castell Angell and behelde this
fyght, &amp; with him were .xxiii. Cardinalles, of which one called the Cardinall
Sanctorum quatuor, or the Cardinall of Pouche was slayne, &amp;
with hym were a .M. Prelates &amp; Priestes .v.C. Genglemen .v.C. souldyers:
wherefore immediatly the Capitayns determined to ley Siege
to the Castell of s. Angell, lest thei within myght issue out &amp; turne theym
to dāmage: wherfore sodeinly a Siege was planted rounde about the
Castell.Rome spo

                   In the meane srason the souldyers fell to spoyle, neuer was
Rome so pylled neither of the Gothes, nor Uandales, for the souldiers
were not content with the spoyle of the Citizens, but they robbed the
Churches, brake vp the houses of close religious persons, &amp; ouerthrew
the cloysters &amp; spoyled virgins, &amp; rauyshed maryed women: Men wer
tormented if they had not to geue euery new asker or demaunder: some
wer strangeled, some wer punyshed by the priuey mēbres, to cause them
to confesse their treasure. This woodnesse contynued a great whyle, &amp;
some man myght thynke that when they had gotten so moche, then thei
would ceasse &amp; be quyet, but that was not so, for they plaied cōtinually
at dyce, some .v.C. some a .M. ducates at a cast: &amp; he that came to play
laded wtih pla
                     •
                  e, went awai again almost naked, &amp; then fell to ryfelyng
agayne. Many of the Citizens whiche coulde not paciently suffre that
vexacion, drowned them selues in Tiber: The souldiers daily that ley
at the siege, made Iestes of the Pope, sometyme they had one ridyng
                     •
                  
lyke the Pope with a whore behynde hym, sometyme he blessed, &amp; sometyme
he cursed, and sometyme thei woulde with one voyce call hym Antech

                  ist.
And they went about to vndermynde the Castell, and to haue
throwen it downe on his head, but the water that ennironeth the castell
dispoynted their purpose. In this season the Duke of Urbyne with
.xv,M. men came to ayde the Pope: but hearyng that Rome was takē

of Rome was taken also taried. The cardinal of Colume came with an
army of Neapolitans to helpe themperours men: but when he saw the
crueltie of the souldiers, he dyd lytle to helpe thē, but he hated thē moch
               The bisshop of Rome was thus besieged, tyl the .viii. ides of Iuli, at
which dai he yelded him selfe for necessitie &amp; penury of al thinges in the
castell. And then he was restored to geue Graces &amp; graunte Bulles as
he dyd before: but he taryed styll in the Castell saynt Angell, and had
a great nombre of Almaynes and Spanyardes to keepe him: But the
Spanyardes bare most rule in the Castell, for no man entered nor came

out of the Castell but by them. When the moneth of Iuly came,
corne began to fayle in Rome, &amp; the pestilence beganne to waxe strong:
wherfore the great Army remoued to a place called Naruya, xl. mile frō
Rome▪ leauyng behynde them suche as kepte the bysshop of Rome.
               When they were departed, the Spanyardes neuer were contented
tyll they had gotten the Almaynes out of the Castell of s. Angell, &amp; so
they had the whole custodye of the Pope. This Rome continued in
peace tyll Septembre, tyll the Armye came agayne from Naruya: for
then the Almayns sware, that they woulde set the Citie and all on fyer,
excepte the Pope woulde pay them their full wages.
               The bisshop of Rome was sumwhat astonyed, and sent to commen
with them, onely two Archebisshops &amp; two Bysshops &amp; two Gentlemē:
These syxe persones, the Almayns tooke as pledges, coutrarye to the
Popes meanyng, &amp; sayde: they would keepe them there tyll they were
payed, &amp; so put them in a strong chaumbre, in the Palace of s. George:
and euery day almost they woulde bryng them furth openly, and scolde
and chyde with them, &amp; make them beleue that they woulde hang them
if they were not payed. And so they kepte them emprisoned in a chaūbre
and .xxiiii. watched euery nyght without the chaumbre dore, &amp; .xiiii. all
day lykewyse:An Escape. and yet for all that watche, they got out at a chymney, on
saynte Andrewes eue, and were no more seene of them.
               This escape was sooner knowen of the Spanyardes that kepte the
Pope, then of the Almaynes that watched the dore. The Almaynes
were so woode with this chaūce, that thei came to the Prince of Orenge
their generall Capitayne, &amp; demaunded money of hym, in suche rigorouse
manier, that he was fayne secretely to flee to Senes: &amp; then for
hym they chose Capitayne, the Marques of Gnasto, whiche gouerned
them tyll February, that he brought them to Naples.
               Aboute the .xxviii. daye of Maie, there were letters broughte to the
Kyng of Englande from the Frenche kyng, of parte of this troble: but
sonday, the second day of Iune, the Kyng receyued letters at the Castell
of Wyndsore, by the whiche he perceyued all the ordre &amp; manier of the
sackyng of Rome, &amp; taking of the Pope, in manier &amp; forme as you haue
hearde: Wherfore the Kyng was sorye, &amp; so were many Prelates: but
the Comminaltie lytle mourned for it, and sayde that the Pope was a
ruffyan, &amp; was not meete for the roume: wherfore they sayde that he beganne
the myschief, &amp; so he was well serued. But the Cardynall which
tooke this matter highly, called to hym the Prelates &amp; the Clergy, and
muche mourned the fall of the Bisshop of Rome, and saw how the
people grudged agaynste the Spiritualtie, for their greate Pride,
Pompe, &amp; yll lyuyng: Wherfore he came to the Kyng, &amp; sayde: Sir,
by them onely callyng of God, you be made Defendor of the Christian
faith: Nowe consydre in what state the Churche of Christe standeth:
See howe the head of the Churche of Rome is in captiuitie: See

now shewe your selfe an aide, a defendour of the Church, and god

               The kyng answered,The kynges answer, my Lorde, I more lament this euel chaunce
then my toungue can tell, but where you lay that I am defendor of the
faith, I assure you, that this war betwene the Emperor and the Pope,
is not for the faith but for temporall possessiōs and dominiōs, and now
sith bishop Clemēt is takē by men of war, what should I doo? my persō

               This seasō began a fame in Londō that y• kynges cōfessor, beyng bishop
of Lyncolne, called doctor Lōglād, &amp; diuerse other great Clarkes
had told the kyng that the mariage betwene him &amp; the Lady Katheryn,

               This rumor sprāg so much, that the kyng sent for sir Thomas Seimer

and his counsayll, that the Cardinall shoulde passe into Fraūce, as his
high ambassadour, but for what cause no persone knew but the kyng til
his retorne.
               Then was much preparacion made at Calleis, for the receauyng of
ye Cardinal, but y• cōmō saiyng was that y• kyng would cōe to Caleis &amp;

                     rde Fraunce. the Cardynall of Yorke, passed thorough the citie
of Londō, accōpaigned with many Lordes &amp; Gētlemē, to the nombre
of twelue hundreth horse, towarde the Sea side, and at Cauntorburie
he rested, &amp; there to the people declared the destruction of Rome, &amp; howe
the Pope was in captiuitie with many Cardinalles: wherefore he caused

a Letany to be sōg by the mōkes of Christes Church, after this maner.A new fonde Letany
                  S, Maria, or a pro Clemente papa. S. Petri ora pro Clemente papa. &amp; so furth al y• letany: thē
he exhorted the people to fast &amp; pray for his deliueraūce which fewdid.
               The xi. day of Maye, the Cardinal with al his traine, toke shipping
at Douer, and the same day lāded at Caleis, wher he was receiued with
procession, and with the hole garrison of the towne.
               Whē the Cardinal was lāded,Barrelles of gold there were set on lande .xvi. barrelles
al ful of gold of the kynges money, which wer deliuered to the capitain
of the castel in charge: of this money the people much grudged, &amp; saied
this money shalbe spēt out of y• realme, &amp; yet Englishemē shal haue no
parte nor proffit of it, but only it shalbe spēt for ye Cardinalles pleasure
and the Frenche kynges, and the Popes proffite.
               The Cardinal was so sore displeased with the Emperour for kepyng
the Pope in prysō (although it wer agaynst his wil &amp; knowlege
                     •
                  ) that he
imagened al the wayes and meanes possible how to hurte &amp; dommage

clothes to Caleis, and so caused ther frendes of Andwarpe to come to
Caleis, &amp; to say, that thei had bought the marchaūtes clothes, &amp; ther at
Caleis paied the custome, &amp; so caried them, to the towne of Andwarp at
thēglish mēnes charge, &amp; ther sold thē to the great losse of thēglishmē.
               While the Cardinal lay in Calleis, the Frenche men daily resorted
to Calleis, to welcome the Cardinall, and sodenly there vpon a noyse
sprang that Calleis should be deliuered, to the Frenche kyng, whiche
vayne saiyng, made many men muse,
               But the .xxii. day of Iuli, the Cardinall departed oute of Calleis, &amp;
with hym was the lorde Cutberd Tūstal bishop of London, the Lorde
Sandes, Chamberlayn to the kyng, the Earle of Darby, sir Henry
Guildforde, sir Thomas More, with many knightes and squyres, to y•
numbre of .xii.C. horse, &amp; in the cariages .lxxx. wagons, &amp; .lx. moyles and
sumpter horses &amp; at Sandifelde, met with him the coūtie Brian gouernour
of Picardie, &amp; Monsir de Bees, capitaine of Bullein, with .iiii.C
men of armes, well appareiled, with banners displaied &amp; al well horsed,
which with trumpets &amp; melodie receiued the Cardinal, &amp; at Marguisō

Bullein where the burges them receiued.
               And at the gate was made a pageaunte in the which was a Nonne
called holy churche, &amp; thre Spaniardes &amp; thre Almaynes had her violated,
and a Cardinall her reskued, and set her vp of newe agayne.
               A nother Pageaunte, was a Cardinal geuyng a Paxe to the Kyng

of England and the French kyng, in token of peace, a nother Paegant
was the Pope, liyng vnder, and the Emperour sittyng in his Maiestie,
and a Cardinall pulled downe the Emperoure, and set vp the
Pope.
               Whē wise men sawe this Pagiaunt, thei smiled &amp; saied, well can the
Frenche kyng flatter, for harde it were for one Cardinall to subde him
that hath pulled downe the master of all Cardinalles.
               Many wordes wer spokē in reproue of this pageaūt, but stil with great
triūph rode these .ii. Cardinalls together, to the Abbey vnder a Canapie
boren ouer them, &amp; there lodged.
               The morow beyng the thre &amp; twentie day he with al his traine remoued
toward Muttrel, &amp; .ii. mile without the towne ther met with him the bailies,
ther to him was made a solempne oraciō, &amp; whē he came to the towne
he was receiued with the Clergie, &amp; ther the Englishmen had strayt lodging,
the nombre was so greate, &amp; so ye morowe he remoued toward Abbeuil
wher he was reciued of the Baylife and aduocates of the towne, and
then of the garison of men of warre of the towne, and there was he receiued
with procession, and Pageauntes to his praise vnder a Canapie,
and so brought to the Chruch, and after to his lodging, and all the Canapies
were set with T C for Thomas Cardinal, and so were al his seruauntes
cotes.
               The third day of August in the Citie of Amias, came the Frenche
kyng in a cote of blakce Ueluet vpon white Satin, and tied with laces
agglated with golde, and with him, the kyng of Nauer, and the Cardinall
of Burbon, the greate master, the Duke of Uandosme, Monsir
de Guise, and Monsir Uaudemount his brother, and the Frenche kynges
mother▪ with many Lordes and Ladies, which were there solemplie
receiued.
               And on Sōday the .iiii. daie of August, the Cardinal came fro Pickqueny
toward Amias, in which towne he lay the night before, and in the
way he was receiued with the prouost of the Citie, and many honorable
personages of the citie, and after the
                     ••
                   came the Iustices and aduocates
and with an eloquent oracion saluted him, and when he was with in
halfe a myle of the towne, the Frenche kyng hym selfe with all his Nobles
mette with him, and louinglie embraced him, and welcommed him
and after toke all the Nobles of England, by the hand, and so brought
the saied Cardinall to Amias: where for hym were deuised many
Pagiauntes, to his prayse, and euer he was called Cardinalis pacificu
                        •
                     
                  
the Cardinall pacifique, and so was writen at the gate of his lodging.
               The Frenche kyng brought the Cardinal to his lodging, &amp; he would
haue brought the kyng to his Courte agayne, but he would in nowise
suffre him, but left him in his lodgyng and the same night the Cardinal
rode to visit the Frenche kynges mother, &amp; there he had long communicacion
and so departed to his lodging.
               
                  
The .v. day of August the Cardinal with the great estates of Fraūce
was conueighed to the Frenche kynges Courte, where he was receined
of the Frenche kynges garde, and in the first Chambre he was receiued
of Knightes &amp; gētlemen, In the the secoūd Chambre, of Earls Barons
and bishoppes. In the third of Ladies
                     •
                   in which chambre the kyng lay
on a bed, and his mother sate hy him, because he had a sore Legg. Then
the Cardinal shewed his commission, which was very large, and in that
was none but he alone: the Bishop of London and the Lorde Sandes,
were in another commission, but that was not shewed than, nor thei called
to counsail. There was the Cardinall highly thanked of the greate
loue that he bare to the house of Fraunce: Then he &amp; the Frēch Lordes
fell to counsaile, first concernyng the Articles of peace, &amp; for the suerty
of performaunce of the same, and so that day thei sat foure houres, and
so euery day was the Cardinall in Counsaile with the Frenche kynges
Counsaile, tyll the .xxviii. day of August, at which day was made in
the Cathedrall Churche of Amias, for the Cardinall of Englande
a place on the North side of the Churche for his Traues, &amp; directly
in the middes of the quere was a curious chappell wroughte of carued
wood all gilt set for the Frenche kyng and his mother, which was couered
with Crimosyn veluet, richely embrodered and hanged with clothes
of Antike makyng, set with pearle &amp; stone, very curiously: The Masse
was song by a Cardinall, and after Masse, the French kyng and diuers
of his Lordes, were sworne to kepe the league, &amp; then was a great Charter
sealed on the high aultare, &amp; deliuered to the Cardinal by the kynges
awne hand, and then the Cardinall of England gaue to theim all (as he
saied clere remission) and then was Te deum song, and so thei all departed.
               Now will I leaue the Cardinall styll at Amias in counsaill, and retorne
to Sir Fraunces Poynes, &amp; Clarēceaux which were at this tyme
arriued in Spaine, in the towne of Uale Doli
                     •
                  e, the third day of Iuly,

for the kyng of Englande, &amp; with him taried till the sixte day of Iuly, &amp;
then Sir Fraunces Poynes was brought to his presēce, and deliuered
the kyng his masters letter, and beside that praied his Maiestie to cō
                  sider
what the kyng of England had doen for hym sence his tendre age,
how that he holpe him
                     •
                   at all times with money and treasure, and howe
that at suche tyme as the Lordes of Spayne would not receiue hym as
there kyng duryng his mothers life, yet by the kynges meane and his
greate labour and cost▪ he was to that Realme receiued: And also howe
the kyng of England had alwaies defended and protected the contreys
of Flaunders, Brabant, and zeland, against all persones, and in the
quarell of themperoure he had strongly inuaded the Realme of Fraūce
so that by his inuasion at home, themperour had obteyned great victorie
in forein places, which he could not haue done, if al the whole realme
of Fraunce had ben without any enemies at home: wherefore the kyng

him as reason woulde, the one halfe of the profite of the battail of Pauy
and also for his parte he required the duke of Orleaūce to be deliuered
to him, and also to paie to the kyng, fourtie thousād pownde, which
he ought to him as money lent, towardes his charges: and farther that
he shoulde delyuer the Pope, and make him a resonable amendes, &amp; no
farther to make warre on him or his dominions.The Emperours answ
                        •
                     r The Emperor after
this demaunde, answerered, sir we assure you that the loue of our vncle
of England, toward vs and the manifolde benefites that we haue receiuid
of him and by his meanes we shal neuer forget, and although oure
power be not able to recompence thesame, yet our good will shall neuer
fayle, to endeuer vs to do him pleasure: and as concernyng his letters
we with oure counsaile shall take aduice, and we trust you shall haue a
reasonable answere, during which time, you may repose you, and althinges
necessarie shalbe at your commaundement: with this answere, Sir
Fraūces departed at this time. Whē it was knowen in Spaine, that the
kyng of England was alied with the Frenche kyng, the Spaniardes
spake largeli and saied that thei cared not for the kyng of England, and
saied farther that all this was the drift of the Cardinall, and by reason
hereof the Englishe marchanntes were euil entertained in Spaine, but
the Emperoure perceiuing this, gaue a generall commaundement, that
all Englishmen shoulde be orderid and reputed as his louing frendes.
               In this very moneth, tidynges was brought to the Emperour, howe
the inhabitauntes of Turnei conspired to distroy Monsire Delanoies
their Capitaine, and deuised to bid him to a banket, &amp; so to 
                     ••
                  ey hym &amp; al
that loued the Emperour, but as God would, he had knowlege of this
treason, and toke the chefe Capitaynes, and did on the sharp execucion
for feare whereof many fled into fraunce.
               The Emperour within a day or twayne called to hym Doctor Lee, &amp;
Syr Fraunces Poynes the kyng of Englandes ambassadors, &amp; saied,
my lordes, we haue percei
                     •
                  ed the kyng your masters requests, which be
greate and of a waightie Importaunce, wherefore wee entend with all
spede to write to the kyng our vncle, and when we haue receiued answere
from him, wee shall delyuer you of suche thinges as you demaund, praiyng
you in the meane season, to take pacience, and so for the tyme they
departed.
               By this tyme was it knowen that the Cardinall of England was
with the Frenche kyng, &amp; ful well knew the Emperour that the Cardinall
woulde doo all for to aide the Frenche kyng and to domage hym
yet had he a great pencion of the Emperour.
               The Englishe Marchauntes fearing the sequele of this matter, co
                     •
                  
                  ueighed
away there goodes daily out of the Emperours dominions:
but still the Englishe ambassadours came to the Emperours Courte,
and one day the Emperour saied to them, my Lordes, I marueill how
the Kyng myne vncle is moued aginst me &amp; my subiectes, I assure you

I wyl no warr with hym, I trust in his faithful promes, &amp; his accustomed
goodnes, &amp; his people I take as my frēdes. If he loue the Frēche
kyng I may not so do, for he to me is vntrue &amp; kepeth no iust promise,
and we neuer compelled him to make any offer, but his offer was of his
owne mocion and he also sworne to mainteine the same, whiche he now
refuseth, and to our great preiudice hath persuaded against vs our dere
vncle of England by peruers imaginacions, whiche I trust will neuer
be our enemy. This many tymes the Emperor would comen with the
Englishe ambassadors whiche lay in Spayne.
               But now must I returne to the Cardinal of England whiche lay at
Amyas, there was great counsailyng from day to day: Fyrst how the
Pope should be deliuered and the sea of Rome brought to a quietnes:
Secondarily how to bryng the Emperor to some reasonable agrement
so that the Frenche kynges children might be deliuered. It was well
considered that themperor had a great 
                     •
                  ordell by reason of the sayd .ii.
hostages, which fordele might perchaunce so stomacke him y• he would
agre to no new condicions nor agrementes. The it was answered on
the otherside that if a great armye were sent into Italy whiche might
driue the Emperors power out of Italy, then that armye should set the
Pope a

to go to the borders of Italy with a smal nomber, but now to him was
assigned viii.M. Bretons with notable capitaines of thesame coūtrey,
and viii.M. Normans with like capitaines, and viii.M. Gascoynes,
and vi.M. Burgonions, iii.M. Sauosyns, viii.M. Swyches and Almaines,
and vi.M. Pycardes of whiche men were v.M. horsemen vnder
the conduict of Mounsire Ealyas, &amp; in this army went sir Robert
Iernyngham &amp; Ihon Carew of Hakam and lxxx. other Englishe gentlemen
whiche were sent thither by the Cardinal from Amyas. When
this army was assembled, the Cardinal deliuered the kyng of Englandes
mony that he had brought out of England in barrels as you haue
heard,English

was called treasorer of the warres. In this army were .iii.M. cariage
men, and aduenturers .iiii. thousand, so that when they were ouer the
mountaines they were lix.M. men, and some writers say C. thousand.
This armye was called in Latin Excercitus Angli

                     mano liberando congregatus, that is to say, the armye of the kynges of England,
and Fraunce gathered for the deliueraunce of the bishoppe of
Rome, and so was this armye reputed. Although fewe people knewe
at the beginnyng in Englande of the conueiyng of the money ouer

the sea, yet when the Englishe coyne was the common payment of
the armye it was then openly knowen: then many menne sayd alas, so
muche mony spent out of the realme, and of this charge the realme shal
not be one peny the better, the kyng hath had of vs a loane and that is
not payde, and the great subsedie was graūted to make the kyng riche
and now is that money to helpe our olde enemies and the Pope whiche
neuer shall do vs good, this the people spake and muche worse. While
the Cardinal was with the Frenche kyng, the Pope sent to him a bull
and made him Uycar general vnder him through al the kyng of Englandes
dominions, and there by a bull he created Anthony de Prato
bishop of Sens and Chauncelor to the Frenche kyng a Cardinal with
great solempnitie. The Cardinall for his solace rode with the Frenche
kyng to Compeigne and Mountdedier, and was euer highly feasted
of the kyng and his mother and of the Chauncellor of Fraunce, and of
all the nobilitie. The was it concluded by the Cardinal &amp; the Frēche
kynges counsail what articles of offer should be sent to the Emperor,
whiche if he refused then open defiaunce to be made to him in the name
of bothe the kynges: The profters were these.

a male.
               The .xv. that the Frenche kyng should be frende to the Emperor &amp; his
frendes, and enemy to his enemyes.
               These with many other articles whiche wer not openly knowen wer

sent to the bishop of Tarby and the vicount of Thorayn ambassadors
to the Emperor from the Frenche kyng. And other articles wer sent to
the kyng of Englandes ambassadors beyng in Spayne: fyrst to moue
the Emperor to take a reasonable peace with the Frenche kyng.
               Also that the kyng of England would release to him all the summes
of money due to him aswel by themperor Maximilian his graūdfather
as by himselfe, and take the Frenche kyng as detter for thesame.
               Item if the Emperor would not therto agree, then the Frenche kyng
should mary the lady Mari doughter to the kyng of Englād and they
both to be enemies to the Emperor.
               When all these thinges wer concluded, the Cardinal toke his leaue
of the Frenche kyng and his mother (whiche tolde him that a noble
ambassade should be shortly sent again into England from the realme
of Fraunce for fortefiyng of all conclusions) and so the sayd Cardinall
with great rewardes returned with all his traine &amp; by iorneys the last
day of September he came to Rychmond to the kyng of England and
there ascertained the kyng of all his doynges, but so could no lord that
then was in Cōmission with him, for they knew nothyng of all his doynges,
whiche sore greued their stomackes.
               The Cardinal whiche muche reioysed in this peace, came y• fyrst day
of the terme into the starre chamber &amp; there by his cōmaundement wer
present the lordes spiritual and temporal of the kynges counsail, and
the Maior and Aldermen of the citie of London, and the iudges of the
lawe, &amp; all the Iustices of peace of all shyres then beyng at Westminster.
And then he sayd, how muche is the realme of England bounde to
God for the high peace that now is concluded? A high peace, yea suche
a peace as was neuer cōcluded betwene no realme, for by my labor and
industry I haue knit the realmes of England and Fraunce in suche a
perfite knot y• it shal neuer fayle, for the thre estates of Fraunce (whiche
here we cal a Parliament) haue affirmed thesame, and therfore now my
lordes be mery for the kyng shal neuermore charge you with warres in
Fraunce, nor the Mayer and other marchaūtes shall neuer be charged
farther with expences, so that with exaccions for warres of Fraūce you
shall no more be charged, for the kyng shall haue no nede, because that
he by this league shalbe the richest prince of the world, for I assure you
he shal haue more treasure out of Fraūce yerely then all his reuenewes
and customes amount to, yea and counte his wardes, forfeites and all
suche casualties. Now syth you haue suche an honorable peace &amp; suche
a profitable peace how muche be you boū
                  
                     •
                   to him which hath brought
this peace about
                     •
                   for this is a peace in secula seculorum. And because this
peace is so noble it is sealed with a seale of golde, and so he caused all
there present to looke on the seale, whiche was the verye great seale of
Fraunce printed in fine gold: at this tale many a man after laughed to
thinke how the Cardinall lyed, for they knew that that he sayd was for
his owne glory, and nothyng should folowe as he sayd.
               
                  
The Frenche kyng accordyng to his appointment sent the lorde
Annas of Momorancy great Master of his house and after that high
Constable of Fraunce, and the bishop of Bayon, the chiefe president of
Roan and Mounsire de Hunyers, as his Ambassadors to the kyng of
England accompanyed with lx. gentlemen well appointed, whiche the
xiiii. day of October lāded at Douer whose seruauntes demeaned thē
selfes so in passyng through Kent that muche busines was to lodge thē
in Lōdon, but the Cardinal cōmaunded corporacions of the citie to prouide
lodgyng for them whiche was neuer seen before, wherat the people
murmured sore, saiyng that the Cardinal was all Frenche. So on the
xx. day of October the sayd ambassadors wer met on Blacke heth by y•
marques of Exeter, the bishop of London, the Uycount Rocheford and
lorde Moūtioy with many men of honor &amp; gentlemen to the nomber of
v.C. horses and more. The Maior and Aldermen of the citie of Lōdon
and the chiefe comminers on horsebacke in their gounes mette the sayd
ambassadors at S. Georges bar &amp; there was made to them a solempne
Oracion, &amp; so frō thence they wer conueyed through Lōdon to y• bishop
of Londons palays &amp; there and nere there about they wer well lodged.

               On tewsday beyng the xxii. day or Septēber, the sayd ambassadors
wer conueyed by water to Grenewyche, where before the kyng sittyng
vnder his clothe of estate the foresayd Mounsire Bayon president of
Roan made an eloquent proposicon in the whiche he muche thāked the
kyng for sendyng so high an ambassador as the Cardinall was, a man
of suche prudence &amp; wit as it appeared by y• knittyng of the league, that
like to him could none be found, for by hs only mediacion the .ii. princes
wer accorded so surely as neuer wer princes before that time, so y• by

thraldome should by the power of these .ii. princes be deliuered &amp; all the
Emperors power should be clene banished &amp; driuen out of Italy, and
the Pope should be restored to his olde estate and dignitie again.
               When this Oracion was done &amp; an answere made to thesame, the
kyng welcomed al the gentlemen of Fraunce &amp; then thei had wyne and
spyce brought to them, wherof they toke part and dranke &amp; so departed

               For the more loue to be engendered betwene these two princes it was
concluded y• the kyng of England should elect the Frēche kyng knight
of the noble order of the Garter,The Frenche kyng knight of the Garter. and that the Frenche kyng should elect
the kyng of England companion of his order of saint Mychel, whiche

                     •
                  leccions passed on both parties. Wherfore in all spede ye kyng sent sir
Arthur Plantagenet Uycount Lysle &amp; bastard sonne to kyng Edward
the fourth, Doctor Taylor Master of the Rolles, sir Nycholas Carew
knight Master of ye kynges horses, and sir Anthony Broune knight, &amp;
sir Thomas Wryothesley knight bryng Garter kyng of armes of the
order, with the whole habite coller and habilimentes of y• order, whiche
order he receiued on sonday the x. day of Nouēber in the citie of Parys
&amp; rode in the sayd habit frō the house of saint Poule to our lady church
and there heard a solempne Masse &amp; dyned in his robe of the order, hauyng
with him thambassadors of Englād, and thesame night he made
to them a banket &amp; so the next day they departed. In likewyse the selfe
same sonday the kyng at Grenewiche receiued y• order of saint Mychel
by the handes of the great Master of Fraunce and Mounsire Huniers
compaignions of thesayd order:The kyng of England knight of the order of saint Mychel. and they al there ware the Mantels of
the sayd order whiche were of cloth of siluer embrodered with Fraūces
knottes &amp; kocle shelles &amp; the collor was of thesame deuise hauing hangyng
before the brest the image of saint Mychel, and in these Mantels
they went doune to the chapel to Masse and there heard Masse, whiche
was 
                     •
                  ong by a bishop, &amp; after Masse they returued to the kinges chamber
where was made a great feast, and after diner whiche was late thei
were conueyed into the tyltyard and there were Iustes of pleasure xii.
against xii. whiche valiauntly furnished their courses til they had broken
C. staues, and then they departed, for night was sodainly come.
               Then the kyng brought the Ambassadors to the newe banket chamber
whiche was hāged with a costly verdor all new, the ground therof was
all gold and the flowers were al of Sattyn siluer of that by the brightsomenes
of the gold, the flowers appeared so freshly that they semed as
they were growyng in dede, the cupberdes of gold and gilte plate with
the eweryes, thesame I ouer passe because you haue heard thereof in
the beginnyng of this yere. Then the kyng, quene &amp; ambassadors satte
doune to supper &amp; were serued with lxxxx. dishes, all the galleryes and
chambers were full of lordes, knightes &amp; gentlemen, &amp; the ga

                  rates aboue
full of Frenche lackays &amp; verlettes whiche wer plēteously serued.
               After supper was done, the kyng led the ambassadors into the great
chamber of disguisynges,
                     
                        •
                     he banquet house. &amp; in the ende of thesame chamber was a foū
                  taine,
and on the one side was a Hawthorne tree all of silke with white

flowers, and on the other side of the fountaine was a Mulbery tree ful
of fayre beryes all silke, on the toppe of the Hawthorne was the armes
of England compassed with the coller of the garter of S. Mychel, &amp; in
the toppe of the Moulberie tree stode the armes of Fraunce within a
garter. This fountaine was all of white Marble grauen &amp; chased, the
bases of thesame were balles of golde supported by rampyng beastes
wounde in leues of golde. In the fyrst worke were gargylles of golde
fiersly faced with spoutes runnyng, The second receit of this foūtaine
was enuironed with wynged serpentes all of golde whiche gryped the
second receite of the fountain, &amp; on the sōmit or toppe of thesame was a
fayre lady, out of whose brestes ran aboundantly water of merueilous
dilicious sauer. About this foūtaine were benches of Rosemary fret
                     •
                  ed
in braydes layde on gold, all the sydes sette with roses in braunches as
they wer growyng about this fountaine, On the benches sat viii. fayre
ladies in straung attier &amp; so richely apparelled in clothe of gold embrodered
and cut ouer siluer, that I cannot expresse the connyng workemā
                  ship
therof. Then when the kyng and quene were set, there was played
before them by children in the Latyn tongue in maner of Tragedy,A play. the
effect wherof was that y• pope was in captiuitie &amp; the churche brought
vnder the foote, wherfore S. Peter appeared and put the Cardinal in
authoritie to bryng the Pope to his libertie and to set vp the churche againe,
and so the Cardinal made intercession to the kinges of England
and of Fraunce, that they tooke part together, and by their meanes the
pope was deliuered. Then in came the Frenche kynges children and
complayned to the Cardinal how the Emperor kept them as hostages
and would not come to no reasonable point with their father, wherfore
they desired y• Cardinal to helpe for their deliueraūce, whiche wrought
so with the kyng his master and the Frenche kyng that he brought the
Emperor to a peace, and caused the two yong princes to be deliuered.
At this play wisemen smyled &amp; thought that it sounded more glorious
to the Cardinal then true to the matter in dede.
               When the play was done and iiii. companies of maskers daunsed,
the kyng, the great master of Fraunce, the duke of Suffolke, the marques
of Exceter, sir Edward Newel and other thre apparelled in cloth
of gold and purple Tynsell sattyn set with cutte warkes of cloth of siluer
plyghted goord fret and folded eche clothe vpon other, and one
plucked vnder another very richely: they had also mantels of crimosyn
Sattyn cast about them Bauderike wise, so that the other garmentes
might largely appeare, and then they entered with noyse of mynstrelsie
and toke the ladies that sat about the fountaine and daūsed with them
very lustely, and when they had daunsed inough then they put of their
visers and were knowen, and so with disporte al this night passed.
               The next day the great master and all his company toke their leaue of
the kyng (except the bishop of Bayon whiche abode as Ambassador in
England) and were highly rewarded,The amba

                     dors departed and so passed to Douer and toke

shippe there and landed at Bullein.
               After that the Frenchmen wer departed y• cōmons spake sore against
the Cardinal &amp; sayd that the Frenchemen did neuer good to England,
and for the Cardinals pleasure we should forsake out olde frēdes and
receiue our olde enemies. When the Cardinal heard of these saiynges
he was not content, wherfore he sent a Cōmission to the Maior of Lō
                  don
to cōmaunde al men not to talke of ye kinges affayres &amp; busines or
of ye quene, or of the kynges coūsail. And if any persone spake or talked
of any of these matters, then he to be taken &amp; brought to the Cardinal.
When this commaundement was once knowen, euery man mistrusted
other and noman durst breake his mynde to other.
               In this moneth of Nouember the Cardinal as legate called y• whole
clergie before him a Westminster &amp; there he sayd that all the abusions
of the churche should be amended,Arthur, B

Arthur, Bylney, Geffery Lome, and Garret that spake against the
Popes aucthoritie and his pompe and pride.
               By reason of the great raines whiche fell in the sowyng tyme &amp; in the
beginnyng of the last yere, now in the beginnyng of this yere corne began
sore to fayle throughout the realme, insomuche that in the citie of
London,A great derth of wheate. bread for a while was very skant and people did starue dayly
for bread, for wheat so failed that none could be gotten for money. Sauyng
that the kyng of his goodnes sent to the citie of his owne prouision
vi.C. quarters, or els for a weeke there had been litle bread in Lō
                  don,
yet was the scarcitie more then y• derth: For then wheate was only
at xv.s. the quarter &amp; frō thēce it rose to xx.s. and after to xxvi.s.viii.d.
the quarter. Men sayd that the negligēce was in sir Thomas Seymer
knight then Maior. Many substancial men would haue made prouision
for their houses, but they feared left the cōminaltie would haue taken
it from them. Then were cōmissions sent into all shyres and commissioners
appointed to se what wheat was in the realme, and the commissioners
ordered that no wheate should be conueyed out of one shyre
to another, whiche cōmaundement had like to haue raysed trouble, and
specially the citie of London wt thesame was sore agreued, for thei had
no arable ground to sowe, but must make prouision with money, which
prouision was them denyed in diuers shyres by that cōmaundement,
whereat the citezens grudged, so the Maior and Aldermen seyng that
the people began to murmur, came to the Cardinal &amp; moued him of the
mischiefe that was like to ensue: either the people must dye for famyne
or els they with strong hand will fetche corne from them that haue it.
               To whō he answered y• they should haue wheat inough out of Fraūce,
for the Frenche kyng sayd to me ꝙ the Cardinal that if he had but
thre bushels of corne in all Fraunce, England should haue twayne
so muche he loueth &amp; regardeth this realme: with this answere they departed
&amp; euery day loked for Frēche wheate but none came: and farther
suche wheat as ye marchaūtes of England had brought and shipped in

Normādy and other places wer there restrained, so that the relefe there
failed, but the gentle marchaūtes of y• Styliard brought frō Danske,
Breme, Hamborough and other places great plētie, &amp; so did other marchaūtes
from Flaūders, Holand, and Frisland, so that wheat was better
chepe in Lōdon then in all England ouer. Then the people sayd, see
how we had been serued by the Frenchemen in our necessitie if themperors
subiectes had not holpen vs. For this kyndnes the cōmon people
loued themperor the better &amp; all his subiectes. The kyng of his goodnes
hearyng that ye wheat in Fraunce was stopped, mused not a litle, &amp;
so for comfort of his citie of Lōdon he lent M. quarters, for the whiche
they both thāked him and praied for him. Then within short space the
marchauntes of London so diligently made prouision in all places for
Wheate &amp; Rye, that after Christmas they lacked none, and all the parties
adioynyng to them wer faine to fetche wheate of them and none to
them was denied, notwithstādyng their vnkynd cōmaundement geuen
that the Londoners should none haue of them.
               Now let vs speake of the army y• the lorde Lawtrick had into Italy
at ye charges of the kyng of England &amp; the Frenche kyng for y• deliueraūce
of pope Clement. The lorde Lawtrick after that his whole army
was come to him to Lyons, &amp; that al thinges necessary wer in readines,
then he set forward with great diligence: but or he had passed y• mountaines
y• Uenicians army was come into Lōbardy abidyng ye cōmyng
of the Frenchemen, &amp; in the meane season thei marched toward themperors
army whiche lay at y• citie of Myllain. Wherof hearing Anthony
de Leua with viii.C. Almaines and Spaniardes on foote, &amp; as many
Italyans marched forward to mete wt thē, &amp; by force caused thē to take
the toune of Meligna for refuge, wher he hearyng y• Ihon de Medices
with a great nomber wer cōmyng toward the Uenicians, he in the euenyng
or his enemies were, aware sodainly set on the sayd Ihon de Medyces,
whiche began to set his men in an order, but he was so enclosed
that he could do nothyng, but tooke his horse and fled and le
                     •
                  t his company
alone, whiche were slaine almoste all, and lost .iiii. great pieces of
ordinaunce, whiche Anthony de Leua car
                     •
                  ed with him to Myllam. In
whiche season the lorde Lawtrick with his army was pas
                     •
                  ed the mountaines
and was come to the citie of As
                     •
                  er abidyng the Swyches, where
he heard tell how that Lewe Erle of Lodron with a great crew of Almaines
was come to the toune to Boskenye Alexādry with money and
vitail to ayde the Almaines that kept Alexandrye: wherfore he sent his
horsemen to stoppe them that they should not passe to Alexandry, and
after them he folowed with his whole army and beseged them in Boske
whiche a certain daies defended, but at the last they yelded the toune, &amp;
became souldiers to the lorde Lawtrick. In this same season Andrewe
Dorye admyral of the Frenche nauy lay before the hauen of Gene and
kept the Genowayes from al marchaundise and vitailes whiche to the
citie might repaire, &amp; in especial he letted certain shippes of corne whiche

lay at Pont de Ferry betwene Gene and Sauona to come to Gene.
The Genowayes whiche lacked corne and were on the land side besieged
by a citezen of their owne whiche was on the Frenche part called
Cesar Fulgosus, imagined how to bryng the shippes of corne into the
citie, and when they sawe that Andrewe Dorye had but xvii. Galyes.
They prepared vi. galeyes to fight wt Andrew Dorye, Duryng which
fight the shippes with corne shuld entre y• hauen. When the galeys wer
abrode, a sodain tempest rose with suche a violence, that Andrew Dory
was tayne to take ye port of Saunona for his succor, and so the shippes
or corne came safe into the hauen of Geane, &amp; all the galeys in safetie:
this good was fortune to Geane at this tyme.
               When the citezens of Geane were thus vitailed, they tooke to them
good courage and in warlike maner issued out agaīst Cesar Fulgosus
whiche knew well that thei had litle more then iii.C. Spaniardes that
could skyll of the warre, &amp; as for the remnant were neither of stomacke
nor of experience in warre, wherfore he boldly set on them, and whyle
thei wer fightyng without, the citezens within whiche be euer mutable,
sodainly cried Fraunce Fraunce, whiche 
                     •
                  lamour came to the eares of
Adurnus whiche was imperial, wherfore he retired backe into the citie
to appeace the rumor, but their enemies folowed them in suche hast that
both entred together and, so Geane was become Frenche. Then thither
came the lorde Lawtrick and put there a capitaine with a retinue for y•
safe kepyng of the citie. Then Adurnus duke of Geane whiche was in
the castle with diuers of the Emperors frendes and lacked vitail &amp; saw
no comfort of reskue, yelded the castle vpon condicion to depart with
bagge and baggage &amp; so they did. In the meane season certain Frenchmen
whiche wer lefte at Boske defaced the toune and then came before
Alexandrie, &amp; there kept a siege volant that no ayde nor succor should
come to the toune, till the whole army wer assembled to besiege ye toune.
But for al that purpose, by the Dounes of Alexandrie, Albericke Barbian
with v.C. souldiers came into the toune whiche muche comforted
the garrison there whiche was in maner dismaied because their ayde at
Boske had fayled them. The Frenchmen besieged the toune and bet it
with ordinaunce and they within manfully defended it and made new
countermures so that their enemies could not enter without ieopardy.
But at the last y• Uenicians brought thither great pieces of ordinaūce
which so sore bet the walles that Baptist Lodryn the capitain saw that
he was not able to defende it &amp; so he deliuered the toune vpō this cōposicion
that he &amp; his should depart with bagge &amp; baggage, &amp; he nor his
to weare no harnys against the Frēche kyng nor his confederates by y•
space of vi. monethes. Then the lorde Lawtrick deliuered the toune to
Fraūces Sforcia according to y• league, which Fraūces put there a cō
                  uenient
garrisō. Thēce y• army remoued to Belgrasse which to thē was
yelded &amp; also deliuered to ye duke of Myllain, &amp; frō thēce they remoued
toward y• citie of Myllain, wherof hering Anthony de Leua fortefied y•
                  
of Myllayn and sent Lewes Barbyan to defende the citie of Pauye.
               When the lord Lawtrick was wt in viii. myle of Myllayn, he sodainly
returned toward Pauy, whiche men iudged to be done for y• displeasure
that was done there to the Frenchemen when their kyng was taken, &amp;
so the .xix. day of September they besieged Pauye, and daily betwene
them wer great skirmishes, but at last they bet the walles so with great
ordinaunce that they made the toune assautable. Then the Frenchmen
threwe into the dyches fagottes and emptye pypes and shortly entered
the toune. The capitain per
                     •
                  eiuyng the toune entered, opened the gate
and yelded himselfe prisoner. Then the Frenchmen 
                     •
                  lewe and kylled on
euery side, robbed and spoyled houses and churches &amp; spared no person
nor place, and of crueltie raūsomed one man v. or vi. tymes, &amp; the Gascoynes
whiche were moste cruel set fyer in the fayre houses &amp; had brent
the whole citie if the lorde Lawtrick after vii. dayes spoilyng had not
commaunded them to case. When Pauye was thus taken &amp; spoyled
the lorde Lawtrick determined with the Cardinal Innocent Legate of
Bonony, whiche was come for the
                     •
                   deliueraunce of the Pope incōtinent
to pas
                     •
                  e to Rome and to driue away al the Emperors power frō thence,
and to restore the pope to libertie.
               F
                     •
                  aunces Sforcia duke of Myllayn hearyng of this determinacion
came to the lorde Lawtri
                     •
                  k to Pauye and required him first to rid the
duchy of Myllayn of themperors souldiers rather then to go forward
and leaue his enemies behynd him. The lorde Lawtrick answered that
he was of thesame opinion, but the cōmission that he had of the Frenche
kyng and the kyng of England was, that with all spede he should go
forward to deliuer the bishop of Rome, whiche done he faythfully promised
that he would returne and expulse all the Emperors power out
of Lombaroy, and in the meane season he would that the duke and the
Uenicians should besiege Anthony de Leua in the castle of Myllayn.
Duke Fraunces semed to be content with this answere, but yet he perceiued
that the Frenche kyng cared not for his restoryng lest he should
be emperial. So for that tyme the duke dissembled the matter &amp; tooke
possession of the citie of Pauye▪ When the lorde Lowtrick had layen
xvi. dayes at Pauy, he dismyssed y• Swyches whiche in no wise would
go with him to Rome, wherfore he marched forward wt his owne army
&amp; came to Plesance where he cōcluded a league with Alphons duke of
Farrer &amp; Frederike marques of Mantua, so y• then he knew wel that he
might wel passe in saftie: &amp; then in good order of battail he marched toward
Rome for y• finishyng of his enterprise. But or he was passed out
of Lōbardy themperor had sent letters to y• B. of Rome &amp; excused him self
that he neither willed nor commaunded suche mischief to be done, &amp;
straightly cōmaunded his capitaines to deliuer him. The prince of Orenge
&amp; other capitaines of themperors hearing his cōmaūdemēt, toke
agremēt wt the pope &amp; his Cardinals
                     •
                   &amp; so he &amp; xii. Cardinals wer boūd
to performe certen articles to ye nōber of xi. &amp; then he was deliuered out

the Castle sainct Angell the .x. day of December and was conueyed to
Oruyet,Clementpope deliuered. where after, he had paied certaine money for the souldiars wages
he was put at full libertie &amp; the Emperors people departed from
him, and thence he remoued to Ancona. When tidynges was brought
into England of his deliueraunce the Cardinal in great hast caused
Te deum to be song on Newyeres day in the kinges chapel and declared
opēly that he was escaped &amp; sayd not deliuered, which made many men
to muse: and on sonday the .v. day of Ianuary the Cardinal with great
triumph came to the churche of saint Paule in London, and on him attended
diuers prelates of the clergy and there Te deum was song again,
and after that doctor Capon opēly declared how that bishop Clement
had been long kept in distres by faulte of tyrānes and infidels and so
kept as prisoner to the behofe of Charles the Emperor, tyll now of late
through the praiers of good Christen people he was escaped the hādes
of his enemies, for whiche cause he wylled all men to geue thankes to
God: That night were great fyers made in the kynges court and in all
London. Shortly after this trueth was knowen, that the Pope was
deliuered by composicion and not frely escaped as the Cardinall had
blowen abrode, but men sayd that he could not leaue his liyng.
               Whyle the lorde Lawtrick was cōtinually goyng forwarde to deliuer
poeple Clement, he was credibly enformed at Bonnony that he was
deliuered and at hs libertie, wherfore he thought his iorney voyde to
go to Rome to do nothing, he therfore determined to turne toward Naples
and to take the citie if it wer not fortefied or replenished with men
of warre, &amp; so accordyng to this purpose he iornied forward with great
diligence. The Emperors capitaines perceiuyng the Frenchemennes
entent caused all their souldiers to depart out of Rome in the beginnyng
of February (whiche was against the minde of the souldiers) and
so came into the realme of Naples and fortefied certain tounes as they
passed, and so came to a toune called Troy and there they taried: This
remouyng was to them very ꝓfitable. For if they had taried at Rome
thei had been set on with the Italyans on the one side, &amp; the Frenchmen
on the otherside, that by euery mannes iudgement they should all haue
been taken or slaine. The lorde Lawtrick departed from Bonnony to
Inmole and so to Fayance Forlicke, Pezere, Senegal, Ancone, Rauenna,
Loret and to Ferne whiche is at the foote of the mountaines of
Sybylles in the duchie of Bresse percell of the realme of Naples, in
whiche toune wer certain nobles of that coūtrey whiche seyng the army
so puissant departed thence to Naples. As the armye passed the mountaines
in the Lent season, there died of very colde v.C. Gascoynes and
mo, and so with muche paine they came nere to Troy in Puylle the xv.
day of Marche, where the Spaniardes and the Emperors armye lay.
Sir Robert Iernynghā of England whiche was capitain of the light
horsemen, knowyng their enemies so nere, desired the lorde Lawtrick
that he with his company might assay the Spaniardes. The lorde

Lawtreck (whether it was for lacke of corage or that he were corrupted
by money) in no wise would suffe sir Robert Iernyngham to fight, but
saied he would take theim at a more auantage shortly, whiche answere
sore greued sir Robert, in somuche he saied he would accuse hym, to both
the kynges their Masters.
               The Spaniardes whiche laie at Troy, thought to entre Naples before
the Frenchemen, and so on the .xxi. daie of Marche beeyng Saterdaie,
thei remoued and came to Naples, &amp; fortified the citee, whiche was
happie for the Emperor, for surely if the Frenchmen had come first, thei
had been Masters of the citee. After the Emperors people wer departed
from Troy, as you haue hard, the Frenchemen besieged it, and within a
xi. daies it was to them yelded, and from thēce thei remoued to Melphe,
a strong litle toune, where thei s
                     •
                  ewe &amp; put to flight .iiii.M. Spaniardes
but thei lost many of their men ther, so that this toune was not to theim
very profitable: Sith the armie was entered into the realme of Naples
there was euer some sickenes emongest them, and in especiall there raygned
emongest thē a sore hore feuer, of the whiche many gentlemen died
or thei came to Naples, for at the toune of Uerse there died sir Richarde
Iernyngham, &amp; Ihon Carew of Hackam, twoo valiant capitaines, sent
thether by the kyng of Englande and diuerse other, whiche twoo gentlemen
be there buried.
               When the Frenchemen had taken Melphe, thei remoued to Boniuēt
and from thence to Magdelon, where thei laye al Easter: and after Easter
thei came before the citee of Naples, and firste thei tooke the palace
that standeth without the citee, very pleasant to beholde, and after that
was taken, thei planted their siege round aboute the citee, and cast trenches,
and made fortificaciōs, for the defence of sodain inuasions of their
enemies: all the whole armie laye in an open plaine ground, without couerture
very nere the citee, by reason whereof, thei wer sore cūbered with
hete and drougth, whereupon ensued greate mortalitie and death, for if
thei had lien on the hill side nere couerte, thei had lien more wholesomly,
but their intent was to lye nere the 
                     •
                  words
                     •
                  , to the intent to kepe their enemies
straight, and therfore thei planted their 
                     •
                  words
                     •
                   the playne, whiche
turned them to muche displeasure and disease. Thus was the siege plā
                  ted
before Naples, in the beginnyng of Aprill, &amp; continued till the .xxvi.
daie of August nexte insuyng, and then by meane of mortalitie thei remoued
as you shall here.
               While the lord Lawtreck was thus passing toward Naples, sir Frā
                  ces
Poynes Knight, whiche was sent with Clarenseaux kyng of Armes
into Spain to the Emperor, returned into England before Christmas,
in thende of December, and left Clarenseaux behynde, to bryng farther
answere frō themperor of thynges demaunded, wherof he said he would
take longer auice or he would answere. This sir Frances reported that
the Emperor so muche fauored and estemed the kyng of Englande, that
at his onely request and contemplacion, he had released and discharged

twelue articles, whiche wer moste greuous &amp; disprofitable to the Frēche
kyng, not for the Frenche kynges sake, but at the intercessiō of the kyng
of Englande: yet this notwithstandyng, the Cardinall so muegled the
kyng, that he so highly fauored the Frenche kyng, that all his causes he
tooke and reputed as his awne, and did all that he might, to bryng the
Frenche kynges purposes aboute.
               The Emperor before this time had written to the Frenche kyng, and
also aduertised thereof the Frenche Ambassadors, that laye in Spaine,
that he would that the Frenche Kyng should sende to hym a diffinitiue
answere, if he would withdrawe his people out of Italy or not, and lett
the Duchie of Millain alone, and to cease of all Inuasions or not, and
this answere to bee geuen the last daie of Ianuary folowyng, and if the
said Frenche kyng answered not by that day, then the lacke of answer to
be taken for a defiaunce. Then the French Ambassadors before the daie,
shewed to the Emperour, the proffe
                     •
                   whiche the Frenche kyng offered to
hym in articles, as you haue harde before, in the conclusion taken at Amias
by the Frenche Kyng and the Cardinall in August laste passed.Themperors answer to the foresaied Articles.
Whiche profers when the Emperoure had hard and seen, he saied to the
Ambassadours, we thought surely that our cosin the Frenche kyng and
we, had been at a full conclusion, when the league and appoyntmēt was
agreed at our toune of Madrill: for when he sued for his deliueraunce
to vs, he and his counsaill offered vs certain profers, whiche wee neuer
demaunded, but we of pitie hauyng compassion of his affliccion, accepted
thesaied offers, and agreed to his deliueraunce, whiche Articles he
promised in the othe of a Kyng, &amp; also on the holy Euangelistes, to performe
to the vttermoste, and thē inuiolatly to obserue and kepe. Whervpon
wee clerely remitted, and deliuered hym into his countrey, of all
whiche promises he hath performed none, wherfore we take hym as periured,
and not worthy to be trusted, and nowe he offereth newe offers,
whiche he cannot performe, as for the money we beleue he is able to pay▪
but as for money dewe for the kyngdom of Naples, we knowe no suche
dutie, for it is our inheritaunce, although kyng Charles the seuenth, by
sotletie once vsurped thesame, which he lōg not enioied: as to release his
title to Millain, that release is voyde, for the Duchie is Imperiall, and
in our gifte as many other seigniories bee: and as touchyng Tournay,
ours it is of right and now in our possession: So that in all these thynges
he would release and rendre thynges that he hath not: and as to the
withdrawyng of his armie out of Italy, he shall not nede, for wee truste
that our armie shall expell theim all Italy, maugre their hartes. And as
touchyng the Kyng of Nauarr, the Duke of Gelder, and Robert de la
Marche, we of pitie let them alone till we se our tyme, and then thei shall
knowe our puyssaunce: And as touchyng his offre to aide vs with a nauie,
we trust we haue suche a nauie prouided, that we shall nede none of
his: and where he saith he will mary our sister quene Aelienor, daughter
of Portyngall, if he had been true, that he might haue dooen or this, but

nowe wee entende not to geue her to our enemie: and as touchyng her
daughter to bee maried to the Dolphyn, that wee leaue in suspence for
this tyme: But where he saieth that he will defend vs, that toucheth our
honour, for well knoweth he that our awne might and puyssaunce, hath
euer defended vs, and him and his power hath defaced and vanquished
wherefore we nede not of his defence, whiche is not able to defende hymself:
and as touchyng the kyng of Englandes debt, we shall reasonably
answere his Ambassadours, for that toucheth not the Frenche Kyng:
But now my Lordes Ambassadours, saied the Emperor, let the Frenche
Kyng your Master, fulfill the promise that he was sworne to, as a true
Prince ought to do, and then he shall haue his children deliuered, or els
accordyng to his othe, let hym yelde hymself prisoner again, and so shal
his honor and truthe be saued, or els not, so with this answere the Ambassadors
departed. Neuerthelesse thei daily sued to the Emperour and
his Counsaill to take the offers whiche were profered by the Frenche
kyng, and emongest other thynges, the warre was sore laied to the Frē
                  che
Ambassadours charge, for that that the Frenche kyng made warre
on the Emperours possessions, without cause and without defiaunce, to
whiche accusement thei answered that that armie was procured by the
Cardinal of Englande, when he was at Amias, for the deliuery of Clement
Bishoppe of Rome, and that the kyng of England bare the moste
charge. When the Emperour hard this answere, he sent for the Ambassadoure
of Englande, and to hym saied: My Lorde Ambassadoure,
I muche maruaill why the kyng your Master, hath so great loue to the
Frenche kyng, his newe reconsiled frende, and withdrawen his loue frō
me, that am his cosyn and alye: How fortuneth this, that your olde auncient
enemies bee now in fauoure, and your olde frendes cast out of fauoure.
I se well there is indignaciō had at our estate, and waies sought
to greue vs, whiche wee hope to withstande: But who would haue
thought that our Uncle of Englande, would haue made warre on vs?
How would he haue vs graunt his requestes and desires for the Frenche
kyng, seyng he sheweth himself our open enemy? Then the Ambassadoure
discretly answered, that he neither heard nor knewe of suche dooynges,
on his faithe and honoure. Well saied the Emperoure, if it bee
true that is reported, myne Uncle is not the Prince that I haue taken
hym for, and if he bee myne enemie, I muste withstande hym, and in a
greate fury, the Emperoure withdrewe hym from the Ambassadoure, to
his priuie chamber.
               Daily the Ambassadours, bothe of Englande and of Fraunce, sollicited
themperor and his counsaill, to accept the Frenche Kynges offers▪
whiche made euer answere, that thei would not truste to the newe promise,
seyng that the olde promise whiche was sworne, was not obserued
and kepte. Nowe whosoeuer indifferently shall consider, the Articles
whiche were offered in the treatie of Madrill, and the Articles offered
now at Amias shall openly perceiue, that the greatest thyng whiche the

Frēche kyng refused to do, was the deliuery of the Duchie of Burgoyn
and the Countie Charoloys, for declaracion whereof, the Frenche kyng
sent for all the nobles of bothe the countreys, and declared to theim this
promise and concord, taken with the Emperor, whiche answered that no
realme or dominion could be transferred to any forrein prince or person
without the sentence, agrement, and submission of the nobles, and commons
of thesame countrey, and therefore thei would neuer assent to that
alteraciō: This answere was deliuered to lorde Charles de la Noa Uiceroy
of Naples, then Ambassador for the Emperor in Fraunce, whiche
thereof certified the Emperours counsaill. But the Emperoure and his
Counsaill thought this to bee but a deceipte, in somuche as the Frenche
kyng had onely called suche of Burgoyne, as hym pleased, and not the
substanciall of the countrey. And farther the Emperor so muche desired
the Duchie of Burgoyne, because he was the very heire there of bloude
discended from duke Phillip, soonne to kyng Ihon of Fraunce, that by
no meanes he would haue that article broken, but he would haue that
Duchie. The Frenche kyng perceiued his mynd, &amp; offered to hym greate
sommes of money for the redemyng of that article, the kyng of Englād
also offered to be suretie for the paiment: but all this could not moue the
Emperoure, but he would haue Burgoyne, and all thesaied treatie and
agrement performed.
               The kyng of Englande consideryng how muche he had doen for the
Emperor, and callyng to his remembraunce, bothe that the Lordes and
Commons of Spaine, would not haue taken hym as kyng▪ his mother
liuyng (although she were Lunatike) because she was heire, without his
greate labour and intercession, and also that he holpe hym to be elected
Emperour, whiche the Frenche kyng had obteigned, if he had not putte
thereunto his aide▪ and sent Docter Richard Pace his Secretory to the
Electors to Franckeford, and moste of all that he at all tymes, had succoured
thesaied Emperoure with money, and was not paied, wherefore
he was not alitle displeased with the Emperours wilfulnes, but more
with his vnkyndnes, and perceiued clerely, that sithe by his meanes he
was so exalted, that now he had forgottē all the kyndnes to hym shewed
wherefore he thought to make hym to knowe hymself by warres, the soner
to bryng hym to accomplishe his request, and to make hym to remē
                  ber
his olde kyndnes, and so by the auise of the Cardinal of Yorke (whiche
loued not the Emperour, for the Bishoppe of Romes case) and other
of his counsaill, he sent woorde to Clarenseaux Kyng of armes, to make
defiaunce to the Emperour,Def
                        •
                     aunces made to the Emperour. and so Guyan Herault for the French kyng
and thesaid Clarenseaux for the kyng of Englande, the .xiiii daie of Ianuary,
in the citee of Burgues in Castle, came before the Emperour beyng
nobly accompaignied with Dukes, Marqueses, Erles, and Barons,
in his greate hall, and there made their defiaunce.
               When the defiaunces were made by bothe the Kynges of Armes, as
you haue heard, all the nobles whiche were present, as the Constable of

Castell, the Duke of Massedonia, the Duke of Inuancaso, the Duke of
Alberkirke, the Duke of Ciuill, the Duke of Nassaw, or Nazareth, the
Duke of Aluoy, the Marques of Sturgus, the Marques of Agular,
the Marques of Uillafranca, the Erle Barcelon, the Erle of Salamatero,
the Erle Boniu
                     •
                  nt, the Erle Arowen, the Erle Agulard, the Erle
Salienas, the Erle Geneuer, with sixe great Lordes Commendatories
Crossed, and many other noble menne and gentlemen, for a truthe to the
nomber of seuen hundred at the least: all these drewe out their swerdes,
and sware that the defiaunces then made should be reuenged, and saied
to the Emperoure: Sir, if the dispite of this defiaunce be vnreuenged,
the infamy▪ &amp; rebuke thereof, shall remain to vs and our heires for euer,
wherefore our landes, lifes, and lordshippes, shalbe at your commaundement,
and while any lyen of your succession remain, this ignominie
shalbe euer newe and not dye, till you haue obteigned the double honor,
against all your enemies.
               When the Emperor was thus defied, the warre was Proclaimed in
Ciuill, in Ualedolite, in Burgus, &amp; in other places through all Spain:
But when the commen people heard of this defiaunce, thei wrong themselfes
by the berdes and sware, that all their landes and goodes should
be spent, for the honor of the Emperor, and to bee reuenged on the Frenche
kyng, whom thei called periured Prince, and so the common people
cried in the stretes, now is come the tyme, that Spain shalbe renoumed,
and reuenged on the Frenchmen▪ for their falsenes and wrong doynges.
But alas saied thei, why should wee make warre with the Englishe nacion,
whiche euer loued vs, and neuer offended vs: but this defiance procedeth
not of them, but onely of the Frenche kyng, and of the Cardinall
of Englande, whiche is sworne frenche: thus the Spanyardes talked,
and euer excused the kyng of Englande, and accused the Cardinall and
saied, that he had a greate pencion out of Spain, and that notwithstandyng,
because he might not haue the bishoprike of Toledo, he caused all
this warre. This Proclamacion of warre, was proclamed with baners
displaied, in the whiche were painted a redde swerde, and a Cresset burnyng,
against he Frenche kyng and his parte takers, not meanyng the
kyng of Englande, by expresse name, but it was rehersed in the Proclamacion,
that the Kyng of Englande had manace
                     •
                  , and defied the Emperour,The Englishe Merchantes arrested in Spain.
in the Frenche kynges querell. Then wer the Englishe Merchantes
in Spain attached, and their goodes put in safe custody, and to thē
was saied that thei were staied onely, till the Emperour was aduertised,
how his subiectes wer ordered in Englande.
               Tidynges of this was first knowen in Fraunce, and from thence letters
were sent to the Frenche Ambassadours in London, how bothe the
Ambassadors of fraunce and of Englande, beyng in Spain, and Guien
and Cl
                     •
                  renseaux officers of Armes, wer retained by the Emperor as
prisoners, whiche report was false, for thei were at libertie, and well cherished,
and in especiall the Englishe Ambassadors and Clarēseaux wer

frendly enterteined in all places. When the Cardinall hard this report,
he was to light of credence (whiche he forthought afterward) and was
sore therewith moued, and in his fury the .xii. daie of February, he caused
Don Hugo de Mēdosa, the Emperors Ambassador, to be taken out
of his house, in sainct Swithines lane in London, and to bee brought to
sir Ihon Daunces place in Marke lane, as a prisoner, &amp; his house with
his goodes wer kept by the Cardinalles seruauntes, til the kynges plesure
wer farther knowen.
               The morowe after beyng the .xiii. daie of February, the Cardinal beyng
in the Starre chamber, called before hym al Iustices of the Peace,The Cardinalles saiyng in the Starre Chamber.
and other honest personages to a greate nomber, and to them said: My
lordes and all you the kynges louyng subiectes, his graces pleasure is
that I should declare to you, howe that his highnes, not of his awne sekyng,
but rather against his will and intent, is entered into warre: For
the electe Emperor Charles the fifth, hath hym so handeled and moued,
that he must of necessitie with hym make war. First, it is not vnknowen
to you all, how good the Kyng hath been to hym, fithe his infancie▪ how
he hath defended his lowe countreis duryng his noneage? Ye▪ what pain
the king toke by his Ambassadors, to sollicite the lordes of Spain, whiche
refused to take him as their kyng, while his mother liued, and by the
kynges onely labor, he came to the kyngdom of Spain, what it cost the
kyng to helpe him to be Emperor, we that be his counsailers can tell, for
if the kyng had not been, surely the Frēch kyng had been Emperor. Beside
all these kyndnesses, he hath lent to thesaid Emperor, diuerse greate
sommes of money, to defend his countreys, &amp; what profite his countreis
haue by the resort of Englishemen thether, ye that be Merchauntes can
tell: for these thynges with many mo proffites, commodities, and gratuities,
the kyng of hym is so litle regarded, that I am halfe ashamed to
report it. True it is that Frances the frenche kyng, was to hym prisoner
(whiche chaunce hath happened to many high princes) the kyng our
master, highly regardyng the peace of Christen princes, by whiche peace
God might the more be glorified: disired the Emperour to take some resonable

nothyng would doo at all, and regarded no more his requestes, then I

you, he hath hūbled hymself asmuche as a prince maie, his honor saued.
He hath offered hym so greate offers, that excepte he should geue 
                     〈◊〉
                  
his realme and Croune, he can offer no more larger, whiche offers I
                     ••
                  
                  sure
you, sore minishe the beautie of his Croune, whiche I shall breuely
declare vnto you. For he offereth to paie fiue hundred thousande poundes
sterlyng, whereof three hundred thousande, to bee paied in hand▪ for

the remnaunt sufficient Bankers to be bound, and farther to discharge
the Emperoure, of all suche sommes of money, as he oweth to the Kyng
of Englande, and to deliuer hym a sufficient acquitaunce for thesame.
Also where the Frenche kyng should haue, out of the kyngdome of Naples
an hundred thousande Crounes yerely, the Frenche kyng will release
thesame pencion, with all the arrerages whiche are no small some.
Also he will release his whole title and right, whiche he hath to the Duchie
of Millayne, his very enheritaunce, and neuer he to chalenge or
claime thesame nor his posteritie. Also where the Countie of Flaunders
maie lawfully appeale to the Parliamentes of Fraunce, from iudgementes
geuen by the Emperour or his Iustices, he is content to release
thesame superioritie and resorte, whiche is a greate minishement to the
prerogatiue royall, of the Realme of Fraunce, for whiche of you (saied
the Cardinall) would concent that the kyng should release his Seignioritie
or superioritie of Wales, Irelande, or Cornewall, I dare saie you
would rather spende your liues and goodes.
               Farther where the Frenche Kyng bought of the Kyng the Citee of
Tournay, for sixe hundred thousande Crounes and odde, yet he is content
to yelde and release thesame Citee to the Emperoure for euer, yea,
and beside this he offereth to take to wife, Elianor Quene Dowager of
Portyngall, without any dower, yea, in her kirtell, &amp; to endowe her with
tenne thousande Markes sterlyng by the yere, and farther that the child
if it bee a male, whiche shalbee gotten of theim twoo, shalbee Duke of
Burgoyne, and bee partetaker of all the honours of Fraunce, whiche
is a greate thyng: Also that the Dolphyn his sonne and heire, shall mary
the daughter of thesaied Lady Elianor, without any threasure to bee
receiued for thesame, whiche proffer is worthe twoo hundred thousande
Markes sterlyng.
               Farther more, he woll lende the Emperour Shippes and Mariners,
to conueigh hym to Rome, and also defende hym against all menne, yea,
what woll he doo more, although the Kyng of Nauerr haue maried his
awne sister, whose Kyngdome the Emperour kepeth by force, yet he offereth
neither to ayde nor comforte hym against the Emperoure, but in
his querel to be against hym: Also he offereth to forsake his old and approued
frendes, Sir Robert de la Marche, and the Duke of Gelders,
whiche faithfully hath serued the realme of Fraunce, and al for the Emperours
sake. But the Emperoure saied he, is so indurate, so vnkynde
and wilfull, that he neither regardes these reasonable requestes, nor yet
the Kynges praiers nor requestes, but answered and saied: that if the
Frenche kyng can dooe all this, he shall haue his children. So that the
Emperoure woll truste no manne, but euery manne muste truste hym:
Yet the Frenche Kyng offereth farther, to withdrawe the puyssaunt armye
of the Lorde Lawtrecke in Italy, and yet thesame passeth prosperiously
forwarde, and is like to doo the Emperour more disauauntage,
then I will now reherse: but the Emperour is so proude, and his people

so cruell, that he nothyng regardeth these offers: for what a crueltie was
this, to pull doune Goddes Uicar of Rome, and persecute the holy 
                     •
                  athers
by extreme tyranny, violated the holy Sacrament, and threwe the
hostes doune on the aultar, and like robbers toke the Pixe: and farther
in the Churche, thei violated Uirgins, and stupred matrones, and dispoyled
the holy Reliques of the citee of Rome. And like as the Kyng in
huntyng tyme hath s

                  ain iii.C. dere, and the garbage and paunches bee
cast round about, in euery quarter of the Parke, so (saied the Cardinal)
euery strete laye full of the priuie members and genitures of the Cardinalles
and holy prelates: the whole history were to abhominable to tell.
Yet notwithstādyng all these offers mocioned, and nothyng regardyng
this detestable tyranny, the whiche euery good Christen man abhorreth,
he will encline to no reason, I am sure that I could shewe you .xx. articles
of promises, whiche he hath broken with the Kyng: so that I assure
you, he kepeth no promise with our souereigne lorde, also contra ius Gencium,
whiche I am sure the greate Turke would not dooe, he kepeth prisoner
the kynges Ambassador Docter Lee, the Frenche Ambassador, and
the Ambassadour of Uenice: and for asmuche as the Emperor refuseth
these offers, whiche amount to eight kynges raunsomes, I trust by this
warre we shall bridle hym, and bryng hym to peace, and this occasiō of
warre, I would all you should declare in your countrey.
               When the Cardinall had saied,The murmor 
                        •
                     f the people. some knocked other on the elbow, and
said softly he lieth, other said, that euil wil said neuer wel, other said that
the Frenche crounes, made hym speake euill of themperor, but thei that
knewe all that you haue hard before saied, that it was shame for hym to
lie in suche an audience. The common people muche lamented, that war
should arise betwene the Kyng and themperor, and especiall their consideracion
was, because the Emperors dominions, had holpen them with
corne, and releued them with grain, whē thei could haue no corne, or litle
out of Fraunce. And in this rumor wer diuerse ships come out of Flaū
                  ders
and that parties, laden with Heryng, Sturgion &amp; all other victale
necessary: beside eight faire shippes, whiche wer laden with corne, all the
saied shippes,Shippes arrested. and all the shippes of Spain, wer staied and arested, and
their 
                     •
                  ailes taken from them, and put in safe custodie. This doyng was
muche talked of by Merchantes, whiche frequented the Emperors dominions,
for thei knewe and openly saied, that the let of the entercourse
of Merchantes, should turne to the greate losse of the Princes, but yet
Englishemen were content, to obeye their kyng and his counsaill.
               The declaracion of warre in Englande against the Emperoure, and
the restraint of Shippes of the Emperoures Subiectes, were shortly
knowen to the Lady Margaret daughter of Sauoy, and aunte to the
Emperour, whiche was gouernor of Flaunders, Brabant, and Zeland
and of all the Lowe Countreis: wherefore she by the auice of the Emperoures
Counsaill to her associate, caused all the Englishemen and their
goodes and Shippes to bee restrained, and thei and their goodes were

put in safe kepyng. Thus the poore Merchantes suffered greate losse,
for the doynges of their Princes, as Horace saieth: Qui
                        •
                      quid delirant Reges, plectuntur
achini: whatsoeuer kynges do, the Commons be punished. Now after
this sodain storme, whiche the Cardinall had moued openly against
the Emperour, for euill entreatyng of the kynges Ambassadour, he had
perfect knowlege that the Emperor, bothe did the kynges Ambassador
greate honour, and also that he neuer restrained hym from his libertie,
wherupon he caused the Emperors Ambassador, whiche before was restrained
of his libertie, to be sent to his awne lodgyng again, and saied
that by the reporte made by the Frenche Ambassadours, he hym restraygned,
and now sithe he knewe the truthe, he mocioned the Kyng for his
deliueraunce.
               The Emperours Ambassadour, called Don Hugo de Mendosa, dissimuled
the matter by apparant signes: and the Cardinall the more to
auoyde suspicion on his behalfe, towarde all the worlde, saied: the kyng
was enformed by the Frenche Ambassadours, that the Ambassadours
of bothe Princes were put in prison, and farther he saied that Clarenseaux
had made the defiaunce to the Emperoure without the kynges
commaundement, but onely did it by the mocion of the Frenche Ambassadours,
to accompaignie the Frenche Herault, and for his presumpteous
act, he should suffre death at Calice at his returne: all these excuses
the Cardinal shewed to the Emperors Ambassador, whiche certified the
Emperour of euery poynt, and sent the letter by poste into Spain, whiche
letters were opened &amp; copied, by the capitain of Bayon, as the poste
passed that waie. And when Clarenseaux returned homewarde out of
Spain, the Capitain gently shewed to hym the copie of the letters, that
the Emperours Ambassadoure had written.Clareseau

was dismaied, to here his daies so shorte: yet he trustyng in
his truth, and grace of his Prince▪ passed forward and came to Bullein,
where he hard worde again of the danger that he was in, wherefore like
a wise man he lefte Calice, and tooke a Ship at Bullein, and landed at

was brought to the kynges presēce, or the Cardinall wist of his returne
and to hym shewed the three Letters, whiche the Cardinall had sent to
hym, chargyng hym to make the defiaunce, or he did intimate the warre.
He declared farther, that neither the Ambassadours of the kyng, nor the
Frenche kyng, nor he wer neuer sequestered from libertie, but gently entertained,
and to the kyng he shewed a chayne, to the value of seuen hundred

                     e saiyng of y• kyng When the kyng had heard all the circumstaunce of his declaracion,
he mused a greate while, and saied: O Lorde Iesu▪ he that I trusted
moste, tolde me all these thynges contrary, well Clarenseaux I wil
bee no more of so light credence hereafter, for nowe I see perfectly, that

I am made to beleue the thyng that was neuer doen.
               Then the Kyng sent for the Cardinall, and priuily talked with hym,
but whatsoeuer he saied to hym, the Cardinall was not very mery, and
after that tyme, the Kyng mistrusted hym euer after. When the Kyng
and his Counsaill, had well digested the Emperoures answere, and his
gentle demeanor toward the kinges Ambassadors, and also had pondered
that the lowe countreis of the Emperor, wer glad to please the kyng
of Englande and his Subiectes: wherefore the kyng commaunded, to
sir Ihon Stile knight, to discharge all the Duchemen and their Shippes,
and deliuered their Sailes, and gaue them license to returne: Naye
said the Duchemen, the Spanyardes and we be the Emperours Subiectes,
why should not thei be also discharged? sir Ihon Stile answered
thē, that his Commission was onely to discharge them. The Duchemen
fearyng that the Frenchemen, would take the seas before thē, and so to
stop thē, departed hastely, curssyng the Cardinal as aucthor of this war.
               When the Lady Margaret heard tell, howe the Duche nacion with
their Shippes and goodes were released, and not the Spanyardes, she
sent for the Englishe Merchauntes, and to theim saied: Sirs, sithe the
Kyng your Master, hath deliuered onely the Duche menne, and not the
Spanyardes, we relese your bodies fr
                     •
                  e, to go at your libertie, but your
goodes shall remain, till we knowe what shal become of the Spanyardes,
and when thei bee deliuered, come for your goodes, and you shall
haue theim deliuered, thus the Englishemen departed, and came to the
kyng, and declared to hym and his counsaill, how thei were entreated.
               This warr with the Emperor was displeasant▪ bothe to Merchantes
and Clothiers,Cōplaynte of

sithe Aprill last past, and now was come the .xi. daie of March, wherfore
all brode Clothes, Kerseis, &amp; Cottons, laye on their handes. In somuche
as when the Clothiers of Essex, Kent, Wilshire, Suffolk, &amp; other shires
whiche vse Clothmakyng, brought clothes into Blackewell hall of Lō
                  don,
to be sold as thei wer wont to do: fewe Merchantes or none bought
any cloth at all. When the Clothiers lacked sale, then thei put frō theim
their spinners, carders, tuckers, &amp; suche other that liue by clothworkyng
whiche caused the people greatly to murmor, and specially in Suffolke,
for if the duke of Norffolk had not wisely appeased theim, no doubt but
thei had fallen to some riotous act. When the kynges counsail was aduertised
of this inconuenience, the Cardinall sent for a greate nomber of
the Merchantes of London, and to them saied: Sirs the kyng is informed,
that you vse not your selfes like Merchātes, but like Grasiers and
artificers▪ for where the Clothiers do daily bryng clothes, to your market
for your ease, to their greate cost, and there be ready to sell them, you
of your wilfulnes wil not bye them, as you haue been accustomed to do:
what maner of men be you saied the Cardinall? I tell you that the kyng
straightly commaundeth you to bye their Clothes, as before tyme you
haue been accustomed to do, vpon pain of his high displeasure.
               
                  
The Merchantes answered, my lorde you knowe well, that we haue
had no trade outward this twelue monethes past, and we haue so many
clothes in our handes, that we knowe not how to vtter them, therefore it
were greate losse to vs to bye any more: wherefore we trust you will not
moue vs to bye the thyng, whiche wee cannot vtter, for in all places our
vent is stopped and forbidden. Well saied the Cardinall, if you wil not
bye the clothes at Blackewell hall, thei shall bee brought to the White
Hall at Westminster, and so you of London shall lose the libertie, and
the kyng shall bye them all, and sell them to Merchant strangers. Then
answered a wise Merchant, my lorde, the kyng maie bye theim aswell at
Blackewell hall, if it please hym, and the strangers will gladlyer receiue
theim there, then at Westminster: You shall not ordre that matter, saied
the Cardinall, and first I will sende into London, to knowe what Clothes
you haue in your handes, and that doen the kyng and his counsail
shall appoynt who shall bye the Clothes I warrant you, with this answere
the Londoners departed.
               When the Clothiers hard that the Cardinall toke their part, thei wared
proude, and spake euill of the Merchantes, and when the Merchā
                  tes
came to bye Clothes, the Clothiers set them hire, then thei were accustomed
to be solde: but at length thei were fain, bothe to abate the price,
and also to seke of the Merchant men, for all the Cardinalles saiyng.
               If this warre was displeasaunt to many in Englande (as you haue
hard) surely it was asmuche or more displeasant, to the tounes and people
of Flaunders, Brabant, Hollande, and Zelande, and in especiall to
the tounes of Andwarpe and Barrow, where the Martes wer kept, and
where the resorte of Englishemen was, for thei saied that their Martes
were vndoen, if the Englishemen came not there, and if there were no
Marte, their Shippes, Hoyes, and Waggons might rest, and all artificers,
Hostes, and Brokers might slepe, and so the people should fal into
miserie and pouerite, of these thynges daily complaintes were made
to the lady Margaret, and the Emperors counsaill, whiche wisely pondered
the complaintes, and after long consultacion had, thei appoynted
certain Ambassadors to go to the kyng of Englande▪ and to entreate for
a truce, or abstinence of warre, whiche Ambassadors came into Englād,
and associated themselfes with Don Hugo de Mendosa, Ambassadoure
there for the Emperor: the one Ambassador was Prouost of Cassell, and
the other Master Ihon Lay souereigne of Flaunders: these .iii. Ambassadors

                     swere. after a good auisement had, answered
and saied: Of warre I am nothyng ioyfull, and of warre I am
lesse fearefull, I thanke God I haue no cause to care for warre, for I
haue bothe men and money, and all thyng ready prepared for thesame,
(whiche thynges I knowe y• other princes lacke, for all their high woordes)
and therefore to that question of warre, I could sone agre, but or I
make you a determinate answere, some part of my mynd I will declare
to you, and I tell you although your Master be a greate Emperor, and
a mightie Prince, I cannot nor maie not suffre hym, to bere doune &amp; destroye
the realme of Fraunce, whiche is our true inheritance, and for the
whiche our brother and alie the Frenche kyng, paieth vs yerely a greate
pencion and tribute, wherfore we of Iustice and equitie, muste maintein
that lande, out of whiche we haue so faire a rent and suche a profite.
               Then saied the Prouost of Cassell, yea sir, and it please you to call to
your remembraunce, the olde and auncient loue and familiaritie, whiche
hath been betwene your Realme, and the houses of Burgoyne and
Flaunders, and the lowe countreys, I assure you the people of all those
coūtreis will liue and dye with you, aboue all men next their souereigne
Lorde, wherefore moste noble Prince neuer concent, that olde loue that
hath so long continued, be now broken and seperated: we saie this for no
feare, for we be well furnished for war, bothe of men and strong castles,
all whiche before this tyme hath been at your cōmaundement, and therfore
the loue that we haue euer borne you, we continue &amp; offer you nowe
to continue: and where we offre you choyse of war or peace, at your pleasure,
surely the Emperour meaneth that for your honor, as though you
should commaunde whiche you would: and if you chose warre, we haue
commission to entreate for peace, and you chose peace, we haue like commission
to thanke you, and to offre vs and ours at your cōmaundement
Then saied the Lorde Hugo de Mendosa to the kyng,The saiyng of Hugo de Mendosa. sir of very right
the Emperor and his countreys, ought to haue your loue and fauor, before
the Frenche kyng and his nacion: for the Frenchmen in the tyme of
their affliccion, made humble sutes and requestes to your grace, whiche
thei neuer would do in the tyme of their prosperitie, but the Emperoure
hath euer continued one man at all tymes, wherefore he is better to bee
trusted, then thei whiche neuer wer long true to you. Wel said the kyng
sithe I haue well perceiued the intent of your commyng, I woll be auised,
and then I will make you an auised answere, and in the meane season
I am content, that there be an abstinence of warre for a tyme, so the
Ambassadours departed for a season, and the Prouost of Casselles, departed
to the lady Margaret with this answere.
               After this the kyng which was wise, well learned, and a farre castyng
prince, consulted with his counsaill of this matter, and there after long
debatyng it was considered, that the kyng was riche, strong, and puyssant
inough to make warre with any prince Christen, and that no prince
could hurte hym by warre or inuasion, therefore some thought it best to

haue warre, but the kyng &amp; the wiser sort cōsidered that if he had warre
with the Emperor, that his marchauntes should lese muche, and if thei
lost, the clothyers and the clothworkers, of whiche were a great multitude
should lese and be brought to extreme pouertie. For it was considered
that the Emperor was lorde of all Spaine, Naples, Sardinia &amp;
so southward to Epuskaia, and likewise northest ward from Grauelyn
to Rye and Reuell, so that Englishe marchauntes passyng on those costes
were euer in daūger. Also no Alame could come into England but
through his dominions, by reason wherof cloth making should decay.
Wherfore the kyng considered if the marchauntes lost, the porer sorte
should lese, and at length he should lese in his customes. Wherfore leauyng
the glorye of warre he tooke mercye on his subiectes and concluded
to take a peace for a tyme till farther cōmunicacion might be had
betwene his coūsail and the Emperors. And vpō this point letters wer
sent into Spayne, Fraunce, and Flaunders, and so this matter continued
vndertermined till answers were brought from outward partes.

alye the Frenche kyng my master, whiche is ratified and confirmed
by the thre estates of the realme of Fraunce, by ye whiche you haue

I assure you it shalbe defended to my power though it be to my losse,
and my studye is no lesse to haue a peace whiche might be honorable to
your master then to myne owne self. With whiche saiyng the Ambassador
held him well contented, So that you may perceiue that the great
pencion and profite that the king of England had out of Fraunce with
the great league and amitie concluded and sworne, was the very cause
why the kyng of England so muche helde with the Frenche kyng &amp; not
for mere loue. For this matter was daily great counsailes, and one day
themperors ambassador was present, another day the Frenche kynges
ambassador was present, but the Cardinal was euer on the Frenche
part. So thus continued this daily counsels with great study.
               
                  
In the same season a Frenche Crayer of .xxx. tonne manned with
xxxviii. Frenchemen laye at Margate to wayte for a pray of some Flemyng

and incontinent put them selfes in a readynes and came so nye that he
hayled the Frencheman, the Frenchman shot a piece of ordinaunce and
with that layde the Flemyng aborde, there was sore fightyng, for the
Frenchmen had crosoowes and the Flemynges had handgunnes. The
Frencheman fell of &amp; would haue been gone, that seyng the Flemyng
whysteled and after the Frencheman made sayle. Now the wynde was
so straynable Est that the Frencheman could sayle no whither but into
the Thames, and so he did and the Fleuiyng folowed, and before Grauesend
the Flemyng borded the Frencheman and there they fought again,
but away againe went the Frenchman and the Flemyng after wt
all his sayles, and so farre sayled the Frencheman that he rāne a long
the Tower wharffe as though he would haue reuen his shippe, the
Flemyng set on and entered the shippe for any thyng the Frencheman
could do and cryed I haue takē the thefe.

Leuetenaunt of the Tower was on the wharffe &amp; saw them fight, called
his men and entered the shippes and toke both the capitaines and their
men. The Flemyng boldly chalenged his prise, for he sayd that open
warre was betwene Fraunce and Flaunders, and sayd farther that the
Frencheman was a pirate: The kynges counsail tooke vp the matter
and made an ende betwene them. This chaunce was muche talked of
that two shippes should sayle in chase from Margate to the Tower
wharffe, because ye before tyme suche a like thyng had neuer been hard.
               Now let vs returne to the lorde Lawtrick whiche had gotten many
tounes in Italy, and had with his great army besieged the citie of Naples
and so it happened that the prince of Orenge &amp; other capitaines y•
xix. day of April set on a great part of the Frenche armye and notwithstandyng
their hardynes the Emperors army obteined the victorie, so
that from that tyme forth the Frenchemen lost, what by pestilence whiche
then was great in Italy, and what by sodain skyrmishes.
               This yere the .xxii. day of February the kyng created at Wynsor sir

                  THe kyng kept the day of sainct George with the companions
of the order of the Garter with great solempnitie at
his Manor of Rychemond, where to him came tidynges
from the army of the lorde Lawtrick in Italy, whiche letters
shewed that the lorde Lawtrick had sent the lorde
Peter de Nauarro the third day of Marche last past to a great toune
called Melffe with x.M. Frenchemen, &amp; within the toune were viii.C.
Spaniardes good men of warre, the lorde Peter de Nauarro besieged
the toune, &amp; after gaue to the same a great assaut, but y• Spaniardes so
defended them with ordinaunce &amp; resistences that they slew v. or vi.M
Frenchemen and caused them to retrete. The lorde Lautrick hearyng
this came in persone with a great nomber to the toune of Smel &amp; merueilously

                   the toune with ordinaunce and then gaue to it a great and
fierse assaut, and so sore that the Spaniardes were put backe, yet they
defended them, so that it was meruail to beholde, for they slewe and destroyed
iiii. M. Frenchemen. The Frenche armye entered the toune on
all sides, and yet the Spanyardes kept y• market with their ordinaūce
as long as they might, but at the last beyng oppressed with multitude
they all were slaine without mercy, so cruel were the Frenchemen: In
this toune was taken the prince of Melff a noble man perteinyng to
the Emperor. Thus was the toune of Melffe taken and spoyled, not
greatly to the Frenchemennes profite, for they lost almost x.M. menne
whiche sore diminished their power.
               Although that this season was an abstinence of war taken betwene
the kyng of England &amp; the ladye Margarete so that the dutche nacion
might safely come &amp; go into England, and y• Englishmen might safely

                  epaire thither, yet betwene the Frenchemen and y• Flemynges was hot
warre on the frontiers, and many a prisoner was taken, and many men
slain, and likewise the one part toke the other on the seas, and someti

would enter the Englishe shippes, and say they had Frenchemens
goodes, so the Englishmen lost till the kyng sent shippes to kepe y• sea:
But for a trueth the Spanyardes were strong on the sea, and to the
Frenchemen did muche harme. The kyng perceiuyng that there was
nothyng cōcluded betwene themperor &amp; him, thought not to be behynd

with a M. souldiers that was v.C. archers and v.C. horsmen, and
that the duke of Suffolke should passe ouer after with a great army to

sodainly he entred the toune without resistence and spoiled and robbed
the toune and slew diuers persones and with muche riches laded their
wagons and so departed and caryed with him diuers riche prisoners.

that neither he nor the quene nor none of their company was enfected

Now let vs leaue England all this Sommer season troubled &amp; vexed
with this sweatyng sicknes, and let vs returne to the affayres of Italy.
               The Emperor which knew how the lord Lawtrick was in Italy wt
a great army, thought it not for his profite to leaue his army there vnsuccored,
wherfore he sent ye lorde Henry the younger duke of Brūswyke
with a great cōpany of Almaynes both on fote and horsebacke. Wherfore
the Uenicians set Fraunces duke of Orbyne to kepe the straytes
and to stoppe him the passage: But when he heard of the puissaunce of
the duke of Brūswycke and the great municions &amp; prouisions of warre
that the Almaynes brought, he turned his iorney, and by aduise of the
Uenicians determined to fortifie the tounes &amp; to defende them against
the Almaynes, and so the duke of Brūswyke with his armye passed the
mountaines and entered Italy burnyng, rasyng &amp; raunsomyng tounes
as he passed, and euer he marched toward Myllain, wherof hearyng the
Mylleners whiche were brought to extreme pouertie by these warres,
beganne to lament and waile for the great tyranny that they iudged to
folowe whiche folowed in dede. For when the Almaines came to Myllain
and demaunded money of the Citezens, they that had nothyng to
paye, were tyed in chaynes and kept miserably in prison tyll they had
made some prouision for the payment, whiche caused the Citezens to
flee out of the citie and to leaue it in maner desolate: whiche thyng Anthony
de Leua perceiuyng, moued with great compassion for the desolacion
of the citie called the Citezens together and promised theim that
if they would paye the wages of the souldiers for xx. dayes onely, he
would cause all the whole army to remoue out of the citie, the poore citezens
made shyft and payed the souldiers, and so they al departed frō
Myllayne and came to the citie of Pauye and tooke it with litle labor
and after that tooke diuers other tounes.
               Anthony de Leua knewe well the Duke of Brunswycke would in
the spryng of the yere set forward towarde Naples to ayde the Emperors
armye against the lorde Lawtrick, therefore he desired the Duke
that or he passed out of the duchye of Myllayne, he would put all the
Frenchemen out of suche fortresses as they kept, whiche thyng he sayd
might be easely done consideryng the great puissaunce of the Almaynes
and the debilitie and lacke of power of the duke of Myllayne,

and in especial consideryng that the Uenicians kept their tounes and
would not ayde the Frenche parte, to the whiche persuasions the Duke
agreed and went toward the citie of Lawde to the whiche thei gaue the
assaut, but they within so well defended if that the Almaynes lost more
then they wanne, wherfore the duke determined to famishe them within
for he knewe by their great nomber that their vitaile must nedes fayle
and so it did in dede, so that no creature but men of war had any vitaile
and therfore the poore Citezens were compelled either to go into the hā
                  des
of their enemies or to dye for famyn.
               In this season was through all Italy a vniuersal warre, famyn and
pe
                     ••
                  ilence or a morreyn wherof the people died in euery place, &amp; in especially
in the Dukes armye whiche caused the moste part of the Almayues
to returne into their countrey, wherfore the duke wisely considered
the chaūce and saw that his army was greatly minished by death, and
saw farther that for lacke of vitaile and money he was not able to conuey
the remnaunt of his armye to Naples, by the aduise of Anthony de
Leua concluded to returne and so shortly after in good order returned
and lost more by the pestilence then by his enemies.
               The Frenche kyng was aduertised by the lorde Lawtrick how his
people decayed sore before Naples, and how the Duke of Brunswyke
was commyng to raise the siege &amp; reskue the citie, wherfore the Frenche
kyng sent lorde Fraunces erle saint Poul brother to the duke of Uandosme
with .viii.M. men to folowe the duke of Brūswyke to Naples,
and if he went not to Naples, then he should ioyne himselfe with Fraū
                  ces
Sforcia duke of Myllayne and the Uenicians and so to expel Anthony
de Leua and all the Emperors souldiers out of Lombardy.
               The Spaniardes within Naples were aduertised that new succors
were commyng to the Frenchemen, wherfore they determined to fight
with them or their new ayde came, and so one day they issued out of the
citie and fought with the Frenchemen and slewe many of them, but by
force they were compelled to returne. The lorde Lawtrick knew well
that the citie could not hold long for lacke of vitaile (for a suertie if vitaile
had not come by sea, the toune had been yelded) wherfore the lorde
Lawtrick suffered his armye to lye still in the plaine fielde all the heate
of the Sommer and brought theim not to the shadow, by reason wherof
there fell suche a disease amongest his armye that they dyed daily in
great nomber and he himselfe fell sicke and lefte the armye and lay at
Uerse, of the whiche mortalitie there dyed in the Frenche campe aboue
xxiiii.M.The death at Naples. men besyde the moste part of all their horses and beastes, of
whiche nomber as diuers wryters do agree there dyed aboue v.M.

to Anthony duke of Lorraine, the lorde of Grauntmount, the capitain
Molyac, the lorde Lauall of the Dolphenye, the capitaine Luper, the

lorde Charles Uyuone lorde of Chataygneray sonne to the lorde Andrewe
of Uyuone Seneschal of Poytew, and many othex noblemen of
name.

                  e the toune of Cappe (whiche moste of all the
tounes in the realme of Naples helde on the Frenche part) became imperiall
and turned to the Emperors part, Whereof hearyng the lorde
Lawtrick made therfore great sorowe, and beyng somewhat amended
of his disease, tooke his horse and came to visite the Campe, and when
he sawe his nomber so minished and his Campe so deso
                     •
                  ate of people
that he perceiued that his enterprise could not be performed, he fell into
suche a malencoly y• his sickenes toke him more feruētly then before,
so that within two daies after, whiche was the xxi. day of August he died
at and his body was sered and conueyed after into Fraunce.
               The Marques of Saluce whiche was Liuetenaunt vnder the lord
Lawtrick called to counsel the Erle Guy of Rancon and Peter de Nauer
and other capitaines that wer left, and after long consultacion they
cōsidered their nomber to be to small either to kepe the siege or to abide
battel, for they passed not v.M. in all. Wherfore they cōcluded to leue
the siege and to returne, and so the xxv. daye of August they brake vp
their Campe and returned toward Fraūce, in whiche returne the Spaniardes
euer costed them, and when they tooke any Frencheman at aduauntage,
they either siewe or tooke them. Thus was the ende of this
iorney by reason of the great mortalitie, whiche if it had not happened,
the citie and the whole realme of Naples had been recouered: For the
citie of Naples could not haue holden x. dayes, after the army remoued
as they con
                     •
                  essed after.
               The Erle of saint Poul (whiche was appointed to passe into Italye
as you haue heard before) knew nothyng of the mortalitie at Naples.
Wherfore with all spede he passed the mountaines the same sea
                     •
                  on that
the duke of Brūswyke returned &amp; came into the duchy of Myllain and
tooke certaine fortresses whiche the Emperors power had wonne, and
after that the aydes of the Uenicians and duke Fraunces Sforcias
were ioyned with him, he besieged the citie of Pauye and within a fewe
dayes the citie was taken by force and the walles beaten doune to the
ground for dispite that the Frenche kyng was taken before the toune.
These doynges were not so muche pleasaunt to the Frenche kyng as
the losse of the citie of Geane was to him displeasaunt. For the same
season Andrewe Dorye whiche was all the doet for the Frenche kyng
on the sea▪ &amp; had before tyme in the Frenche kynges quarel vanquished
the lord Hugo Uiceroy of Naples, &amp; had taken ye Marques of Gnasto
&amp; Ascayne de Columna &amp; other capitaines belongyng to the Emperor,
whiche prisoners the Frenche kyng cōmaunded him to deliuer into his
hādes, which thing Andrew Dory thought not reasonable, cōsideryng

that he tooke him, and for that cause and because his wages was not
payed, he tooke his Galeys and sayled to Geane where he was borne
and also was there of great authoritie and estimacion, and there he so
persuaded the people that they became unperial and tooke Trenulsius
the Frenche kynges frende and put him in warde, and prepared to detende
the citie against the Frenche kynges power, whereof hearyng the
Erle of saint Poule sent in al hast his light horsemen to succor the citie
but or they came the citezens wer so furnished that the Frenchemen had
no hope of recouery, wherfore they returned to Alexādry, and there thei
counsailed together how to take the citie of Myllayne whiche was sore
desolate of people and brought to great mischiefe by the crueltie of
Spaniardes and Almaines, but when they heard tel that the Emperor
had sent ii.M. Spaniardes to ayde Anthony de Leua, they chaunged
their purpose and determined to recouer the citie of Geane againe. For
whiche purpose the erle lefe the Uenicians at Casyan, and the power of
duke Fraunces Sforcie he left at Pauye to kepe the passages that the
Spaniardes should not stray farre abrode, and also to kepe the passages
that no vitayle should come to y• Spaniardes whiche at that tyme
had onely the citie and castle of Myllain and none other fortresse to resorte
to. And therle himselfe lay at a village called Landryan, and for
the more spede of his enterprise he sent his forward with all his artille

Of all these doynges Anthony de Leua liyng at Myllayn by
his espyals was truely from tyme to tyme aduertised, wherfore he like
a polletike capitaine considered how the erle had done folishly to sende
his ordinaunce and forward before, he therfore determined to take the
auauntage of the Frenchemen if he might, and so called to him all his
capitaines and to theim sayd: Felowes in armes and souldiors to the

if we ouercome him the praise shalbe ours, and if he flye at our cōmyng

all the other souldiers agreed (for they wer very nedy and glad to haue

be redy at an houre, and that euerye man should haue a white shyrt aboue
his apparel that one in the darke might know another, and when
euery man was ready and the euenyng approched, Anthony de Leua

but because the nomber of his people was so lytle they doubted the sequele
of his aduenture. But for all their imaginacions he with his
people secretely issued out of Myllain and passed forward without any
noyse, and in the mornyng sodainly set on therle of saint Poul and his
army, so that the erle had no leysure to send for his ordinaunce and forward
but was fayne to trust to suche as were then with him. And at the

certain treasons of the which he was accused to the Emperor, to whom
themperor answered that the next sommer he would come into Italy to
receiue his Emperial croune, and then he would take suche an order as
right and equitie should require. This was the ende of the warres begon
betwene the kyng of England &amp; the Frenche kyng on ye one partie
and the Emperor on the other partie, in the xix. yere of the kyng as you
haue heard before. For after this iorney the lady Margaret duches of
Sauoy &amp; aunt to themperor, and the lady Loyse duches of Angulesme
and mother to the French kyng continually labored for a peace, so that
by their meanes a treatie was appointed to be kept at Cābray in Iune

               Now let vs returne to the kyng of England whiche was in a great
scruple of his conscience &amp; not quiet in his mynde, because that diuers
diuines well learned secretely enformed him that he liued in adultry wt
his brothers wife to the great peril of his soule, and tolde him farther y•
the court of Rome could not dispence wt Gods cōmaūdement &amp; precept.

in saint Peters churche▪ how thei had violat virgyns, rauished mennes

the college of Rome found at the kynges handes &amp; the Frenche kinges
in the tyme of that tribulacion, that if they had not ioyned together, the
citie of Rome wt all their gouernors had been brought to vtter ruyne

Oracion doctor Fox Prouost of Cambridge made a discrete answere,The answere &amp;
as to the fyrst point he declared that the kyng muche lamented to heare
his frendes yea or any other christen men to be ordered or hādeled with
suche tyrāny and oppression: and as touchyng the second point he sayd
that the kyng did but the duetie of a christen prince to releue his frēdes
beyng in captiuitie for the whiche he would y• the whole citie of Rome
should geue thankes to God and not to him. After whiche answere
made the two legates communed secretely with the kyng a long space

Of the cōmyng of this Legate the common people beyng ignorant of

hath oppressed you nor taken any thyng from vs, nor we haue inuaded
no realme but we haue had victory &amp; honor, so that we thinke that you

all our doynges in our life tyme are clerely defaced &amp; worthy of no memorie
if we leue you in trouble at the tyme of our death. For if our true
heyre be not knowen at the tyme of our death, se what mischiefe &amp; trouble
shall succede to you and your children. The experience therof some
of you haue sene after the death of our noble graundfather kyng Edward
the .iiii. and some haue heard what mischief &amp; manslaughter continues
in this realme betwene the houses of Yorke and Lancaster, by y•
whiche discencion this realme was like to haue been clerely destroyed.
And although it hath pleased almighty God to send vs a fayre doughter
of a noble woman and me begotten to our great comfort &amp; ioy, yet it
hath been tolde vs by diuers great clerkes that neither she is our lawful
doughter nor her mother our lawful wife, but that we liue together
abhominably and detestably in open adultry, insomuche that when our
ambassade was last in Fraunce &amp; mocion was made that the Duke of
Orleance should mary our sayd doughter, one of the chiefe coūsailors
to the Frenche kyng sayd, It wer well done to know whither she be the
kyng of Englād his lawful doughter or not, for well knowen it is that
he begat her on his brothers wife whiche is directly against Gods law
&amp; his precept. Thinke you my lordes that these wordes touche not by
body &amp; soule, thinke you y• these doynges do not daily &amp; hourly trouble
my conscience &amp; vexe my spirites, yes we doubt not but &amp; if it wer your
owne cause euery mā would seke remedy when the peril of your soule &amp;

the losse of your inheritaūce is openly layde to you. For this only cause
I protest before God &amp; in the worde of a prince, I haue asked counsail
of the greatest clerkes in Christendome, and for this cause I haue sent
for this legate as a man indifferent only to know the truth and to settle
my conscience and for none other cause as God can iudge. And as touchyng
the quene, if it be adiudged by y• law of God that she is my lawfull
wife, there was neuer thyng more pleasaunt nor more acceptable
to me in my life both for the discharge &amp; cleryng of my conscience &amp; also
for the good qualities and condicions the whiche I know to be in her.

is discended (as all you knowe) she is a woman of moste gentlenes,
of moste humilitie and buxumnes, yea and of al good qualities appertainyng
to nobilitie, she is without comparison, as I this xx. yeres almoste
haue had the true experiment, so that if I were to mary againe
i
                     •
                   the mariage might be good I would surely chsoe her aboue all other
women: But if it be determined by iudgement that our mariage was
against Goddes law and clerely voyde, then I shall not onely sorowe
the departyng from so good a Lady and louyng cōpanion, but muche
more lament and bewaile my 
                     •
                  nfortunate chaunce that I haue so long
liued in adultry to Goddes great displeasure, and haue no true heyre
of my body to inherite this realme. These be the sores that vexe my
mynde, these be the panges that trouble my cōscience, &amp; for these greues
I seke a remedy. Therfore I require of you all as our trust and confidence
is in you to declare to our subiectes our mynde and entent accordyng
to our true meanyng, and desyre them to pray with vs that the
very trueth may be knowen for the discharge of our conscience and sauyng
of our soule, and for the declaracion hereof I haue assembled you
together and now you may depart.
               To see what countenaunce was made amongest the hearers of this
Oracion it was a straunge sight, for some sighthed and sayd nothyng,
other were sory to heare the kyng so troubled in his conscience. Other
that

                  auored the quene muche sorowed that this matter was now opened,
and so euery man spake as his heart serued him, but the kyng euer
labored to know the trueth for discharge of his conscience.
               Shortly after this the two Legates came to the quene at the same
place of Brydewell,The saiyng of the Legate. and declared to her how they were deputed iudges
indifferent betwene the kyng and her to heare and determyn whether
the mariage betwene them siode with Goddes lawe or not. When she
heard the cause of their cōmyng, no merueil though she were astonnied
for it touched her very nere. And when she had paused a while she answered:

                   When I haue been maried to him almost xx. yeres &amp;
in the meane season neuer questiō was made before? Dyuers prelates
yet beyng aliue &amp; lordes also &amp; priuie coūsailors with the kyng at that
tyme, then adiudged our mariage lawful and honest, and now to say it

is detestable and abhominable, I thynke it greate maruell: and in especiall
when I consider, what a wise prince the kynges father was, and also
the loue and naturall affeccion, that Kyng Fernando my father bare
vnto me: I thynke in my self that neither of our fathers, were so vncircumspect,
so vnwise, and of so small imaginacion, but thei forsawe what
might folowe of our mariage, and in especiall the Kyng my father, sent
to the Courte of Rome, and there after long suite, with greate cost and
charge, obteigned a license and dispensacion, that I beyng the one brothers
wife, and perauenture carnally knowen, might without scrupull
of conscience, mary with the other brother lawfully, whiche license vnder
lead I haue yet to shewe, whiche thynges make me to saie and surely
beleue, that our mariage was bothe lawfull, good, and Godly: But of
this trouble I onely maie thanke you my lorde Cardinall of Yorke, for
because I haue wondered at your high pride &amp; vainglory, and abhorre
your volupteous life, and abhominable Lechery, and litle regard your
presūpteous power and tyranny, therefore of malice you haue kyndeled
this fire, and set this matter a broche, &amp; in especiall for the greate malice,
that you beare to my nephewe the Emperour, whom I perfectly knowe
you hate worse then a Scorpion, because he would not satisfie your ambicion,
and make you Pope by force, and therefore you haue saied more
then once, that you would trouble hym and his frendes, and you haue
kept hym true promise, for of all his warres and vexaciōs, he onely may
thanke you, and as for me his poore aunte and kynswoman, what trouble
you put me to, by this newe found doubt, God knoweth, to whom I
commit my cause accordyng to the truth. The Cardinall of Yorke excused
hymself, saiyng, that he was not the beginner, nor the mouer of the
doubte, &amp; that it was sore against his will, that euer the mariage should
come in question, but he saied that by his superior the Bishop of Rome,
he was deputied as a Iudge to heare the cause, whiche he sware on his
profession to heare indifferently, but whatsoeuer was saied, she beleued
hym not, and so the Legates toke their leaue of her and departed. These
woordes were spoken in Frenche, and written by Cardinall Campeius
secretory, whiche was present, and by me translated as nere as I could.
               The kyng notwithstandyng that his mynd was vnquiet, yet he kept
a good countenaunce toward the Quene, with asmuche loue, honor, and
gentlenes, as could be shewed to suche a Princes, but he absteined from
her bed, till the truth was tried▪ accordyng as his Ghostly counsail had
auised hym, whiche was to hym no litle pain, for surely he loued her as
well, as any Prince might loue his wife, and she hym again, and therefore
it was greate pitie, that their mariage was not good.
               The more to quicken his spirites and for recreacion, the Kyng kepte
his Christmas at Grenewiche, with muche solempnitie and greate plentie
of viandes, and thether came the twoo Legates, whiche wer receiued
by twoo Dukes, and diuerse Erles, Barons and Gentlemen, to whom
the kyng shewed greate pleasures, bothe of Iustes, Tornay, Bankettes

the ruine of his realme and the successiō of thesame, whiche was
a waightie thyng to consider, and no wisedome to let so greate a doubte

               After Christmas and all Lent till Easter, was none other thyng commoned
of, but onely of the kynges mariage, the Archebishop of Cantorbury
sent for the famous docters, of bothe the Uniuersities to Lambeth
and there wer euery daie disputacions, and cōmonynges of this matter,
and because the kyng perceiued &amp; knewe well, that the quene was wedded
to her awne opinion, and that he would that she should do nothyng
without counsail, he bad her chose the best clerkes of his realme, to be of
her counsaill, and licensed them to do▪ the best on her part that thei could

hanged a clothe of estate, with a Chayer and Cusshions of riche Tissue,
for the kyng, and on the left hande of the Courte, was set riche chayer
for the Quene. When the place was redy, the Kyng and the Quene wer
ascited by Docter Sampson, to appere before the Legates, at the forenamed
place, the twentie and eight daie of Maie, beyng then the morow
after the feast of Corpus Christi, in proper persō, or by their Proctors. At the
daie assigned, the Legates came to the forenamed place, with Crosses
Pillers, Axes, and all the Ceremonies belongyng to their degrees, and
after that thei wer set (the Cardinal of Yorke sittyng on the right hand)

their Commission was redde, and the cause of their commyng thether openly
declared, the effect whereof was, that the Courte of Rome was instructed,
that greate Clerkes and learned men, had enformed the Kyng,
that his mariage with his brothers wife, was vnlawfull, dāpnable, and
directly againat the Lawe of God, wherefore thei were directed and appoynted
by thesaied Courte, to bee iudges in the cause, and to here what
on bothe parties could bee alleged: after this was dooen the kyng was
called by name, for whom twoo procters appered, then the Quene was
called, whiche within shorte space, beyng accompaignied with the foure
Bishoppes, and other of her counsaill, and a greate compaignie of Ladies
and gentle women folowyng her,The Quene appealed. came personally before the Legates,
and after her obeisance, sadly and with greate grauitie doen, she appeled
from them, as Iudges not competent for that cause, to the Courte
of Rome▪ and after that doen she departed again. Notwithstādyng this
appele, the Legates sat wekely, &amp; euery daie were argumentes on bothe
partes, and nothyng els doen.
               The king whiche onely desired, to haue an ende in this matter, for discharge
of his conscience, came to the Courte the of Iune, and
the Quene also, where he standyng vnder his clothe of estate, saied these
wordes in effect folowyng:The Kynges Oracion. My lordes, Legates of the Sea Appostolike,
whiche be deputied Iudges, in this greate and waightie matter, I
moste hartely beseche you, to ponder my mynde and entent, whiche onely
is to haue a finall ende, for the discharge of my cōscience: for euery good
christen man knoweth what pain, 
                     •
                   what vnquietnes he suffreth, which
hath his conscience greued, for I assure you on myne honoure, that this
matter hath so vexed my mynd, &amp; troubled my spirites, that I can scantely
studie any thyng, whiche should bee proffitable for my Realme and
people. And for to haue a quietnes in body and soule, is my desire and
request, and not for any grudge that I beare to her that I haue maried
for I dare saie that for her womanhode, wisedom, nobilitie, and gentlenes,
neuer Prince had suche another, and therfore if I would willyngly
chaunge I wer not wise: wherfore my suite is to you my Lordes at this
tyme, to haue a spedy ende, accordyng to right, for the quietnes of my
mynde and conscience onely, and for no other cause as God knoweth.
               When the Kyng had saied, the Quene departed without any thyng
saiyng, then she was called, to knowe whether she would bide by her appeale,
or answere there before the Legates, her Procter answered, that
she would byde by her appeale, that notwithstandyng, the Counsailers
on bothe sides euery daie almoste met, and debated this matter substancially,
so that at the last the Diuines were all of opinion, that the mariage
was against the Lawe of God, if she were carnally knowen, by the
first brother whiche thyng she clerely denied) but to that was answered,
that Prince Arthur her husbande, confessed the act doen, when he called
for drynke earely in the mornyng, saiyng: that he had been in Spaine
that night, whiche was a hote countrey, meanyng that he had carnally

vsed her, father at the tyme of the death of Prince Arthur, she thought
and iudged that she was with childe, and for that cause, the kyng was
deferred from the Title and Creacion of the Prince of Wales, almoste
halfe a yere, whiche thyng could not haue been iudged, if she had not
been carnally knowen.
               Also she her self caused a Bull to bee purchased, in the whiche were

carnally knowen, whiche woordes were not in the firste Bull graunted
by Iuly at her seconde mariage to the Kyng, whiche seconde Bull with
that clause was onely purchased▪ to dispence with the second Matrimony,
although there were carnall copulacion before, whiche Bull neded
not to haue been purchased, if there had been no carnall copulacion, for
then the 
                     •
                  irst Bull had been sufficient.
               When the Diuines on her side, were beaten from that grounde, then
thei fell to perswasions of Naturall reason, how this should not be vndoen
for three causes: One was because if it should bee broken, the onely
childe o
                     •
                   the Kyng, should bee a Bastarde, whiche were a greate mischief
to the realme: Secondly, the seperacion should bee a cause of great
vnkyndnes, betwene her kynred and this realme. And the thirde cause
was, that the continuaunce of so long space, had made the Mariage
honest: These perswasions with many other, were sette furthe by the
Quenes Counsaill, and in especiall by the Bishop of Rochester, whiche
stode stiffe in her cause, but yet Goddes precept was not answered, wherfore
thei left that ground and fell to pleadyng, that the Court of Rome
had dispensed with that Mariage: To this some Lawers saied, that no
yearthely persone is able to dispence with the positiue Lawe of God.
               When the Legates had heard the opinions of the Diuines, and sawe
that their opinion for the moste part, was against the Matrimony, and
that nowe the question was brought to dispute, the aucthoritie of the
Court of Rome, thei beganne a litle to quicken: For thei consi
                     •
                  ered that
if thei should 
                     •
                  aie and determyne, that the Court of Rome might not dispence
in that case, that fewe menne would thynke, that thei might dispence
in any other case, which
                     •
                   should bee to theim, a greate losse and
hurt. Wherfore thei dissimuled the matter, and euer told the Kyng, that
he should haue an ende shortly, and tracted furthe the tyme with Oracions
and Sophisticall argumentes, till August beganne to approche:
then Cardinall Campeius saied, that thei might not sit after Iuly, till
October, all whiche season was a vacacion in the Courte of Rome, and
their Courte beeyng a member of the Courte of Rome, thei muste nedes
dooe thesame: this saiyng was reported to the kyng, whiche by that saiyng
knewe perfectly, that he should then haue no ende, and then he complained
to the dukes of Norfolk a
                     •
                  d Suffolk, and other nobles of his
counsaill, how he was delayed, and willed theim at the nexte Session, to
require them to make an ende of the cause, and what Iudgement soeuer
thei gaue, he would gladly accepte it, for the quietnes of his conscience.
               
                  
These noble menne came to the place, where the Legates sat, the .xxx.
daie of August, beyng Fridaie, where as Cardinal Campeius, declared
in eloquent Latin, and sware on his honor and faithe that he bare to the
churhce of Rome, that the course of the courtes there be, at thende of Iuly,
to suspende all causes, till the .iiii. daie of October, and if any cause
bee treated, and iudged in the meane season, that iudgement to be clerely
voyde, and therfore he required the kyng to take pacience, till that time,
trustyng that then thei should procede toward sentēce, so that he should
bee contented: the noble menne desired theim to make an ende, whatsoeuer
it were, that daie or the nexte daie, whiche was the last daie of Iuly:
but thei answered that thei could sitte no more till October, whiche answere
sore displeased the noble menne, whiche the kyng had sent thether,
in so muche that Charles Duke of Suffolke, seeyng the delaye, gaue a
greate clappe on the Table with his hande and said: by the Masse, now
I see that the olde saied sawe is true, that there was neuer Legate nor
Cardinall, that did good in Englande, and with that saiyng all the
Temporall Lordes departed to the Kyng▪ leauyng the Legates sittyng
one lookyng on the other sore astonnied, because thei sawe the Temporall
lordes depart in anger.
               You maie bee sure, that the kyng was not well content, when he hard
of this delaye, but yet like a wise Prince, he tooke it paciently, trustyng
to haue an ende in October ensuyng: But when he heard tell, that a letter
was sent for the Cardinall Campeius, that he should with spede, returne
into Italy, and that he prouided for his iorney: Then he openly
perceiued, that the Legates dissimuled the tyme to haue the matter in
the Courte at Rome, for the mainteinaunce of their aucthoritie, knoweyng
perfectly, that there he should bee foded furthe with argumentes so
long, that he should bee in maner wery, and also all that tyme, he should
bee vnquiet in his conscience, whiche was the greatest care, that he had,
but the seconde care that he tooke, was to see the Cardinall of Yorke,
(whom he so highly fauoured and trusted, and whom he had so highly
promoted, bothe to the Archbishopriche of Yorke, and the Bishopriches
of Winchester, Duresme, and the Abbay of Saincte Albones, with many
other greate dignities and promocions, beside the Chauncellorshippe
of Englande) so vnfaithfully to dissimule with hym, and not to
open the very truthe, whiche caused hym clerely to cast hym out of his
fauor, in the whiche he had long been.
               Whē the nobles and prelates perceiued, that the kynges fauor was
from the Cardinall sore minished, euery manne of the Kynges Counsaill,
beganne to laye to hym suche offences, as thei knewe by hym, and
all their accusacions were written in a boke, and all their handes set to
it, to the nombre of thirtie and foure, whiche boke thei presented to the
kyng. When the kyng sawe the boke, he marueiled not a litle, for by the
Articles conteigned in thesame, he euidently perceiued the high pride
and coueteousnes of the Cardinall, and sawe openly with what dissimulacion

and clokyng, he had handeled the kynges causes: how he with
faire liyng woordes, he blynded and defrauded the kyng, moste vntruly,
whiche accusacions sore moued the kyng against hym, but yet he
kepte it close for a tyme, and so the Kyng rode on his progresse with the
Quene to Woodstocke. And at the feast of the Natiuitie of our Lady,
he came to Grafton, beside Stony Stratforde, and thether came the
twoo Legates, and were but meanely receiued, sauyng that the Kyng
made to theim good semblaunce, and in especiall to Cardinall Campeius,
because he came into Englande at his request: and after dinner the
saied Campeius toke his leaue of the kyng, and then the kyng him conueighed
to the chamber dore, and there thei departed, and the Cardinall
of Yorke also wente with his compaignion to Tocester, and on the morowe
he came to Grafton to speake with the kyng, whiche was then rydyng
out on huntyng, and sent hym woorde by Henry Norreis, that he
should accompaignie Campeius to London, and when the kyng came
to London, he would more cōmen with hym: thus almoste dismaied the
Cardinall of Yorke, returned to his compaignion to Tocester, and so
thei came together to London, where to the Cardinall Campeius, were
deliuered greate rewardes, and so he toke his iorney toward the sea side
Where the kynges counsail, caused his chestes &amp; cariages to be opened
to se what letters the Cardinal of Yorke had sent to the court of Rome, &amp;
there wer but a fewe letters found, for thei were sent before in poste, but
in many chestes wer found, old hosen, old coates, and suche vile stuffe, as
no honest man would eary to haue it, which serche muche displeased Cā
                  peius,
and the more because his coffers wer like wise opened in Chepe,
by the rashenes of a Moile, as you heard in the tenth yere of the kyng.
               Thus departed out of Englande in high displeasure, the craftie Cardinall
Campeius,The last time the Card
                        •
                     nall came to the kynges presence. leauyng behynde hym his subtle felowe, whiche after
their departyng from the kyng at Grafton, neuer sawe the Kyng,
nor came in his presence. This greate Session of the legates, was commued
of through Christendome, and in especiall in Spain, and other
the Emperors Dominions, which sore grudged that the Quene should
bee diuorsed from the kyng: and surely the moste part of the laye people
of Englande, whiche knewe not the lawe of God, sore murmored at the
matter, and muche the more, because there was a gentle woman in the
Courte, called Anne Bulleyne, daughter to sir Thomas Bulleyne, Uiscount
Rocheforde, whom the kyng muche fauoured in all honestie, and
surely none otherwise, as all the worlde well knewe after. For this cause
the Quenes ladies, gentlewomen, and seruauntes, largely spake &amp; saied
that she so entised the kyng, and brought him in suche amours, that onely
for her sake and occasion, he would be diuorsed from his Quene, this
was the foolishe communicacion of people, contrary to the truth, as you
haue hard declared before.
               The kyng whiche all the twentie yere paste, had been ruled by other,
and in especiall by the Cardinall of Yorke, began now to be a ruler &amp; a

Kyng, yea, a Kyng of suche witte, wisedome, and pollicie, that the like
hath not reigned ouer this Realme, as you shall playnly perceiue
here after: aswell for the settyng furthe of true Doctryne, as also 
                     •
                  or the
augmentacion of his Croune. For when he perceiued, howe the Cardinalles
had handeled hym, and sawe plainly that the lawe of God was
clere, that he might not mary his brothers wife, he thought to sende his
Ambassadours to all the Uniuersities in Fraunce and Italy, to knowe
their determinacions, and for that cause he sent Doctor Stokesley, and
Doctor Foxe, twoo greate Cler

                  es into Fraunce, whiche sped as you

               The kyng continually studiyng on this matter,The Kyng begynneth to rule. called a counsaill of
the chief of his nobles, to begin at Westminster, the firste daie of October
next ensuyng, and also somoned a Parliamēt, to begin the third daie
of Nouember, then immediatly folowyng, &amp; declared that thesame coū
                  saill,
should deuise diuerse actes, necessary and nedefull to bee passed at
thesaied Parliament, for reformacion of certain exaccions, dooen by the
clergie to the laye people, to whiche counsaill and Parliament, the Cardinall
was warned and somoned, whiche muche conforted hym, that he
outwardly litle abashed: and so he and al the counsaill, came to the coū
                  saill
chamber at Westminster,The Cardinalles prid
                        •
                      abated. and there diuerse daies, communed of diuerse
thynges, but nothyng was fully concluded, and there the Cardinall
shewed hymself, muche more humblier, then he was wont to be, and
the lordes shewed themselfes more higher and straunger, then thei were
wont to bee, but for all that he abashed not his countenaunce, but came
into Westminster hall with all his trayne, the firste daie of the Terme:
but none of the kynges seruauntes would go before, as thei were wont
to do, and so he sat in the Chauncery, but not in the Starre chamber, for
all the lordes and other the kynges counsaill, were gone to Wynsore to
the Kyng, where thei enformed the Kyng, that all thynges that he had
dooen almoste, by his power Legantyne, were in the case of the Premunire
and prouison: and that the Cardinall had forfected, all his landes,
tenementes,The Cardinall in the Premunire. goodes, and catelles to the kyng: wherefore the kyng willyng
to ordre him, accordyng to the ordre of his lawes, caused his attorney
Cristopher Hales, to sue out a Writte of Premunire against hym,
in the whiche he licensed hym, to make an attorney.
               And farther, the seuentene daie of Nouember, he sent the twoo dukes
of Norffolke and Suffolk, to his place at Westminster, to fetche awaie
the greate Seale of Englande, whiche he was lothe to deliuer, if there
had been may remedy, but in conclusion he deliuered it, to the twoo Dukes,
whiche deliuered thesame to Docter Tailor Master of the Rolles
to cary it to the kyng, whiche so did the next daie: &amp; beside this the Kyng
sent sir William Fitz Willyam knight of the Garter, and Thresorer of
his house, and Docter Stephin Gardiner, newle made Secretary, to se
that no goodes should be embesiled out of his house: and farther ordeined
that the Cardinall should remoue to Ashire beside kyngston, there

to tary the kynges pleasure, &amp; to haue all thynes deliuered to hym, whiche
wer necessary for hym, but not after his old pōpeous &amp; superfluous
fashion: For all his goodes wer seazed to the kynges vse. Whē the seale
was thus taken from the Cardinall, the dukes of Norffolke and Suffolk,
with many Erles, Bishoppes, and Barons, came into the Starre
chamber, the .xix daie of October, where the duke of Norffolke declared
that the kynges highnes, for diueise and sondery offences, had taken frō
hym his greate Seale, and deposed hym of all Offices, and least menne
might complain for lacke of Iustice, 
                     〈◊〉
                   had appoynted hym &amp; the duke
of Suffolke, with the assent to the 
                     〈◊〉
                   lordes, to sit in the Starre chā
                  ber,
to heare and determine causes indifferently, and that of all thynges
the Kynges pleasure and commaundement was, that thei should kepe
their handes close, from any rewardes takyng, or maintenaunce, and so
that weke thei sat in the Starre chamber, and determined causes.
               On the daie of thesame moneth, the Cardinall remoued out of
his house called Yorke place,The Cardinalles remouyng from Yorke place. with one Crosse saiyng, that he would he
had neuer borne more, meanyng that by his crosse, that he bare as legate
whiche degre taking was his confusion, as you se openly, and so he toke
his barge, and went to Putney by Water, and there toke his horse and
rode to Asher, where he remaigned till Lent after.
               Duryng whiche tyme, he beeyng called on for an answere in the kynges
Bench, to the premunire, for geuyng benefices by preuension, in disturbance
of mennes enheritaunce, and diuerse other open causes in the
premunire: he accordyng to the kynges license, constituted Ihon Scute
and Edmond Ienny, apprentices of the Lawe his attorneis, whiche by
his awne warrant signed with his hande, confessed all thynges concernyng
thesaid suite, for thei wer to opē to be cloked or hidden, and so iudgement
was geuen, that he should forfet al his lādes, tenemētes, goodes
and catalles, and should be out of the kynges protecciō, but for all that
the kyng sent hym a sufficient proteccion: &amp; of his gentlenes left to hym
the Bishoprikes of Yorke and Winchester, and gaue to hym plate and
stuffe, conueniēt for his degree, and the bishoprike of Duresme, he gaue
to docter Tunstall bishop of London, and the Abbey of sainct Albones
he gaue to the Prior of Norwiche, and to London he promoted Docter
Ihon Stokesley, then Ambassador to the Uniuersities, for the kynges
mariage, as you haue hard before. For all these kyndnes shewed to the
Cardinall, yet he still maligned against the kyng, as you shall perceiue
here after, by his vntrue doynges, whiche brought hym to confusion.
               The twentie and three daie of October, the kyng came to his Manor
of Grenewiche, and there muche consulted with his counsaill, for a mete
manne to bee his Chauncellour, so that in no wise he were no manne of
the Spiritualtie, and so after long debate, the Kyng resoluted hymself
vpon sir Thomas More knight, Chauncellour of the Duchie of Lancastre,
a manne well learned in the toungues, and also in the Common
Lawe, whose witte was fyne, and full of imaginacions, by reason wherof,

he was to muche geuen to mockyng, whiche was to his grauitie a
greate blemishe.Sir Thomas More made Chauncellor. And then on the Sondaie, the twentie and foure daie
of thesame monethe, the kyng made hym his Chauncellour, and deliuered
hym the greate Seale, whiche Lorde Chauncellour, the next morow
after, was ledde into the Chauncery, by the two dukes of Norffolk and
Suffolke, and there sworne, and then the Mace was borne before hym.
               Now let vs returne to the treatie of Cambray, whiche was appoynted
to bee kepte the last Sommer, for the conclusion of a peace, betwene
the Emperor on the one part, and the kyng of Englande, and the Frenche
kyng on the other parte, for whiche conclusion there came to Cambrey,
the Lady Margaret Duches of Sauoy, Aunte to the Emperour
and the Lady Loyse Duches of Angulesme, and mother to the Frenche
kyng and Docter Tunstall bishoppe of London, and after bishoppe of
Duresme, and sir Thomas More knight, after made Chauncellour of
Englande, and diuerse other for the Kyng of Englande, all these mette
there in the beginnyng of Iuly, accompaignied with diuerse great princes
and Counsailers, on euery parte, and after long debatyng on bothe
sides, there was a good conclusion taken, the fifth daie of August, in the
whiche was concluded, that the treatie of Madrill, should stande in his
full strength and vertue, sauyng the thirde and fourthe, and the leuenth
and fourtenth articles, whiche touche the Duchie of Burgoyne, and other
lordshippes.
               Item, it was agreed that the Frenche kyng should haue his children
deliuered again, paiyng to the Emperoure twoo Millyons of Crounes
of gold, whereof he should paie at the deliueryng of the children, twelue
hundred thousande Crounes.
               Item, that the Frenche kyng should acquite the Emperoure, against
the kyng of Englande, of foure skore and tenne thousande Crounes,
whiche the Emperoure ought to the kyng of Englande, and the kyng
of Englande to deliuer all suche bondes and gages, as he had of the
Emperours.
               Item, as touchyng the remnant, whiche was fiue hundred and tenne
thousande Crounes, the Emperor should haue .xxv. thousande crounes
rent yerely, for the whiche he should haue the landes, of the Duches of
Uandosme, liyng in Flaunders, and Brabant bounde.
               Item, that Flaunders and diuerse other coūtreys, should not behold
in chief, nor haue resort to the croune of Fraunce.
               Item, that the realme of Naples, the Duchie of Millain, &amp; the countie
of Ast, should for euer remain to the Emperor.
               Item, that the Frenche Kyng should with drawe all suche souldiers
as he had, out of Italy.
               
                  
Item, that the Lady Elianor should bee brought into Fraunce, with
the Frenche Kynges children, and in tyme conuenient should be maried
to the Frenche kyng.
               Item, that the Frenche Kyng should aide the Emperor with twelue
Gallies to go into Italy.
               Item, that all prisoners on bothe parties should be acquited.
               Item, that the Frenche Kyng should not ayde Robert de la Marche,
against the bishop of Luke.
               Item, that al the goodes moueable and vnmoueable, of Charles late
Duke of Burbon, should bee restored to his heires, thei paiyng to lorde
Henry, Marques of Dapenete, and Erle of Nassaw, Lorde Chamberlayne
to the Emperor, tenne thousande Ducates, whiche he lent to thesaied
Duke of Burbon.
               Item, that Ihon Erle of Panthieure, should bee remitted to al suche
goodes, as were Erle Rene his fathers.
               Item, the Lorde Laurence de Gorowod, greate Master to the Emperoure,
should bee restored to the Lordeshippes of Chalmount, and
Monteualle, whiche he bought of the Duke of Burbon, or els to haue
his money again.
               Item, Phillip de Chalon Prince of Orenge and Uiceroy of Naples,
to be restored to all his landes in Burgoyne.
               Item, that the Duches of Uandosme, and Loys Erle of Nau
                     •
                  rs
should haue all suche right and accions, as thei should haue had, before
the warre began.
               In the Emperours countreys, when all thynges were written, sealed
and finished, there was a solempne Masse song in the Cathedrall churche
of Cambrey, the twoo ladies Ambassadors of the kyng of Englāde,
sittyng in greate estate, and after Masse the peace was Proclaimed, betwene
the three Princes, and Te deum song, and money cast to the people,
and greate fires made through the citee. Thesame night the Frenche
Kyng came into Cambrey, well and nobly accompaignied and saluted
the Ladies, and to them made diuerse bankettes, and then all persones,
departed into their countrey glad of this concord.
               This peace was called the womennes peace,The womennes peace. for because that notwithstandyng
this conclusion, yet neither the Emperoure trusted the Frenche
kyng, nor he neither trusted nor loued hym, and their Subiectes
wer in thesame case. This Proclamacion was proclaymed solempnely,
by Herauldes, with trōpettes in the citee of London, whiche Proclamacion
muche reioysed the Englishe Merchantes, repairyng into Spain,

Flaunders, Brabant, Zelande, and other the Emperors dominions, for
duryng the warres, Merchantes were euill handeled on bothe parties,
whiche caused them to be desirous of peace.
               Here is to be remembred, that at this present tyme, Willyā Tyndale
had newly translated and imprinted the Newe Testament in Englishe,
and the Bishop of London,Cutbard Tū
                     stall bishop o
                        •
                      Lōdō, bought Newe Testamentes to burne. not pleased with the translacion thereof, debated
with hymself, how he might compasse and deuise, to destroye that
false and erronious translacion, (as he saied). And so it happened that
one Augustine Packyngton, a Mercer and Merchant of London, and
of a greate honestie, thesame tyme was in Andwarp, where the Bishope
then was, and this Packyngton was a man that highly fauored William
Tindale, but to the bishop vtterly shewed hymself to the contrary.
The bishop desirous to haue his purpose brought to passe, commoned
of the New Testamentes, and how gladly he would bye them. Packyngton
then hearyng that he wished for, saied vnto the bishop, my Lorde,
if it bee your pleasure, I can in his matter dooe more I dare saie, then
moste of the Merchauntes of Englande that are here, for I knowe the
Dutche men and straungiers, that haue bought theim of Tyndale, and
haue theim here to sell, so that if it be your lordshippes pleasure, to paye
for them, for otherwise I cannot come by them, but I must disburse money
for theim, I will then assure you, to haue euery boke of them, that is
imprinted and is here vnsolde. The Bishop thinkyng that he had God
by the too, when in deede he had (as after he thought) the Deuell by the
fifte, saied, gentle Master Packyngton, do your diligence and get them
and with all my harte I will paie for them, whatsoeuer thei cost you, for
the bokes are erronious and naughtes and I entende surely to destroy
theim all,Augustyne Packyngton the Bishop of Londōs merchaunt. and to burne theim at Paules Crosse. Agustine Packyngton
came to Willyam Tyndale and saied, Willyam I knowe thou arte a
poore man, and hast a hepe of newe Testamentes, and bokes by thee, for
the whiche thou hast bothe indaungered thy frendes, and beggered thy
self, and I haue now gotten thee a Merchaunt, whiche with ready money
shall dispatche thee of all that thou hast, if you thynke it so proffitable
for hour self. Who is the Merchant said Tindale? The bishoppe of
London saied Packyngton, O that is because he will burne them saied
Thyndale, ye Mary ꝙ Packyngton, I am the gladder said Tyndale, for
these two benefites shall come therof, I shall get money of hym for these
bokes, to bryng my self out of debt, (and the whole worlde shall crie out
vpon the burnyng of Goddes worde). And the ouerplus of the money,
that shall remain to me, shall make me more studious, to correct thesaid
Newe Testament, and so newly to Imprint thesame once again, and I
trust the second will muche better like you, then euer did the first: And so
forward went the bargain, the bishop had the bokes, Packyngton had
the thankes, and Tyndale had the money.
               Afterward when mo newe Testamentes were Imprinted, thei came
thicke and threfold into Englande, the bishop of London hearyng that

still there were so many Newe Testamentes abrode, sent for Augustyne
Packyngton and saied vnto him: Sir how commeth this, that there are
so many Newe Testamentes abrode, and your promised and assured me,
that you had bought al? then said Packyngtō, I promes you I bought
all that then was to bee had: but I perceiue thei haue made more sence,
and it will neuer bee better, as long as thei haue the letters and stampes,
therefore it wer best for your lordeshippe, to bye the stampes to, and
then are you sure: the bishop smiled at hym and saied, well Packyngton
well, and so ended this matter.
               Shortly after it fortuned one George Constātine,George Constantyne. to be apprehended
by sir Thomas More, whiche then was lorde Chauncellor of England,
of suspiciō of certain heresies. And this Constantine beyng with More,
after diuerse examinacions of diuerse thynges, emong other, Master
More saied in this wise to Constantine, Constantine I would haue thee

               While this treatie was thus in communicacion at Cambrey, themperor
whiche knewe that his people lacked aide in Italy, and also perceiued
that the people of Germany and Italy, had hym not in suche honor
as thei would, if he wer once crouned Emperor, for in al writynges thei

by long iorneis, he came nere to Bononie, where firste met with hym, all

and then thei embraced together, and went into the church together and
after went in to the pallace where thei wer lodged both, and daily kepte
great counsayles together. While the Cardinall lay at Bononie, ther
came to him Fraunces Sforse Duke of Millane, to excuse hym selfe
of all thynges to hym obiected, and by muche entreatyng at the Popes
request he pardoned hym his offence, and restored him to his dignitie
and possession, paiyng to hym nine hundreth thousand Ducates, &amp; till
thei wer paied, the Castel of Millayne, and the toune of Crome, should
abide in themperours possessiō. After this agrement the Emperoure
sēt for Anthony de leua, and made him capitayne of his ordinaunce, and
so now the duchy of Millayne was brought to quiet. In the same season
the kyng of Englād sent sir Nicholas Carew knight master of his
horses, &amp; Doctor Sāpson to Bononie for the ratificacion of the league
concluded at Cambray, to the performance whereof the Emperour was
solemplie sworne, and so the ambassadours departed: lykewise themperour
sēt into England, Peter Lord of Rosebec, which likewise sawe the
kyng of England sworne to performe the same,
               According to the somons the kyng of Englāde began his high court of
parliamēt, the third day of Nouembre. On which day he came by water
to his place of Bridewell, and there he &amp; his nobles put on there robes
of parliamēt, and so came to the blacke Freers church, wher a Masse of
the holy ghost was solemplie song by the kynges Chappell, &amp; after the
Masse, the kyng with all the Lordes of the parliament, and Commons
which were somoned to apere at that day came in to the parliamēt chā
                  bre,
wher the kyng sat in his Throne or seate royal, and Sir Thomas
More his Chauncelor standyng on the righthand of the kyng behynde
the barre made an eloquent Oracion,An Oracion declaryng that like as a good
shepard whiche not alonely kepeth and attendeth well his shepe, but also
forseeth &amp; prouideth for althyng, which either may be hurtful or noysome
to his stoke, or may preserue and defende thesame agaynst all peryles
that may chaunce to come, so the kyng whiche was the sheaperd,
ruler and gouernour of his realme, vigilātly forseyng thinges to come
cōsidered how diuers lawes before this tyme wer made nowe by lōg cō
                  tinuance
of tyme and mutacion of thinges, very insufficient, &amp; vnperfight,
and also by the frayl condicion of man, diuers new enormities were
sprōg amongest the people, for the which no law was yet made to reforme
thesame, which was the very cause why at that tyme the kyng had

somoned his high courte of parliament: and he resembled the king to a
shepard, or heard man for this cause, for if a prince be compared to hys
riches, he is but a richeman, if a prince be compared to his honour, he is
but an honorable man: but compare him to the multitude of his people
and the numbre of his flocke, thē he is a ruler, a gouernor of might and
puissaunce, so that his people maketh him a prince, as of the multitude
of shepe commeth the name of a shepherd: and as you se that emongest
a great flocke of shepe some be rottē and fauty which the good sheperd
sendeth from the good shepe, so the great wether which is of late fallen
as you all knowe, so craftely, so scabedly, ye &amp; so vntruly iuggeled with
the kyng, that all men must nedes gesse and thinke that he thought in
him self, that the had no wit to perceiue his craftie doyng, or els that he
presumed that the kyng woulde not se nor know his fraudulent Iuggeling
and attemptes: but he was deceiued, for his graces sight was to
quike and penetrable, that he saw him, ye and saw through him, both
with in and without, so that all thing to him was open, and according
to his desert he hath had a gentle correction, which small ponishmēt the
kyng will not to be an example to other offendoures, but clerly declareth
that whosoeuer here after shall make like attempt or commit like
offence, shall not escape with lyke ponyshment: and because you of the
common house be am grosse▪ multitude, and cannot speake all at one time:
Therfore the kynges pleasure is, that you shall resorte totn he nether
house, and ther emongest your self accordyng to the olde and auncient
custome to chose an able persō to be your cōmon mouth &amp; speaker, &amp; after
youre election so made to aduertise his grace therof, which wyll declare
to you his pleasure what day he wil haue hym presēt in this place
               After this done, the commons resorted to the nether house, &amp; thei chose
for there speaker Thomas AudeleyThomas Audelei chosen speake
                        •
                     . Esquier &amp; attorney of the Duchie
of Lancaster, and the same day was the parliamēt adiourned to Westminster.
On the sixt day of the same moneth the king came in to the parliament
chambre and all the Lordes in there robes, and ther the commons
of the nether house presented there speker, whiche there made an
eloquent OracionAn oracion which cōsisted in two poynctes, the first poynct was
that he muche praysed the kyng for his equitie and Iustice, mixed with
mercy and pitie, so that none offence was forgotten and left vnponished
nor in the punishment the extremitie nor the rigor of the lawe not cruelly
extended, whiche shuld be a cause to bridel all men from doing like

                     〈◊〉
                  , and also a comforte to 
                     •
                  ffendors to confesse there crime and
offence, and an occasion of amendment and reconciliacion.
               The second poinct was, that he disabled him selfe, both for lacke of wit
learnyng and discreciō to so high an office, beseching the kyng to cause
his c
                     •
                  mons to resort eftsones to ther common house, and there to chose
an other speaker for that parliament.
               To this the kyng (by the mouth of the Lorde Chauncelor) answered
that where be disabled hym selfe in▪ wit and learnyng, his awne ornate

oracion there made testified the contrary, and as touching his discreciō
and other qualities, the kyng him selfe had well knowē him and his doynges,
sith he was in his seruice, to be both wise and discrete, and so for
an hable man he accepted him, and for the speaker he him admitted.
               When the commons were assembled in the nether house, thei began to
common of their grefes wherwith the spiritualtie had before tyme greuously
oppressed them▪ both cōtrarie to the lawe of the realme, &amp; cōtrarie
to al righte, and in especial thei were sore moued with sixe greate causes.
               The first for the excesse fynes, which the ordinaries toke for probat of 
Testamentes, insomuche that Sir henry Guilford knight of the gartir
and comptrollor of the kinges house, declared in the open Parliament
on his fidelitle that he and other beyng executors to Sir William
Compton knight paied for the probate of his wil to the Cardinal &amp; the
Archbishop of Cauntorburie a thousand Marke sterlyng: after this declaracion
were shewed so many extorcions done by ordinaries for probates
of willes, that it were to muche to rehearse.
               The second cause was the great polling and extreme exaccion, which 
the spirituall men vsed in takyng of corps presentes or mortuaries, 
                     •
                  or
the children of the defunct should al dye for hunger and go a beggyng
rather then thei woulde of charitie geue to them the sely kow which the
dead man ought if he had but only one▪ such was the charitie then.
               The third cause was, that priestes beyng surueiors, stuardes and officers 
to Bishoppes, Abbotes, and other spirituall heddes, had and occupied
Fermes, Graunges, &amp; grasing in euery contrey, so that the poore
husbandmen coulde haue nothyng but of them, and yet for that thei
shulde pay derely.
               The fourth cause was the Abbotes Priors and spiritual men kept 
Tanne house, &amp; bought and soulde woll, clothe and all maner of marchaundise
as other temporall marchauntees did.
               The fift cause, was beause that spiritual persones promoted to great 
benefices &amp; hauyng there liuyng of the flocke, were liyng in the courte
in lordes houses, &amp; toke al of the parishoners, &amp; nothin
                     •
                   spent on the at
al, so that for lack of residēce both the poore of the parish lacked refreshyng,
&amp; vniuersally al the parishioners lacked preaching, &amp; true instrucciō
of Godes worde, to the greate pe
                     •
                  ell of there soules.
               The sixt cause was to se one priest beyng litle learned to haue tenne 
or twelue benefices and to be resident on none, and to know many well
learned scholers in the vniuersitie which we
                     •
                   able to preche &amp; teache, to
haue nether benefice nor exhibicion.
               These thinges before this time might in nowise, be towched nor yet
talked of by no man except he would be made an heritike, ro lese al that
he had, for the bishopes were chauncelors, and had all the rule about
the kyng, so that no man durst once presume to attempt any thing contrary
to their proffit, or commoditie.
               
                  
But now when god had illumined the eies of the kyng, and that ther
subtell doinges was once espied: then men began charitably to desyre
a reformacion, and so at this Parliamēt men begā to shew ther grudges.
               Where vpon the Burgesses of the Parliament, appoincted suche as
were learned in the law being of the common house, to drawe one bill of
the probates of Testamentes, a nother for Mortuaries, and the thirde
for none residēce, pluralities, and takyng of Fermes by spiritual men,
               The learned men toke muche payne, and firste sett furthe the bill of
Mortuaries, whiche passed the common house, and was sent vp to the
Lordes.
               To this bill, the spirituall Lordes made a fayre face, saiyng that
surely priestes and curates toke more then thei should, and therefore it
were well done to take some reasonable ordre, thus thei spake because it
touched them litle.
               But with in two daies after was sēt vp the bill concerning probates
of Testamentes, at the which the Archbishop of Cauntorburre in especiall,
and all other bishoppes in generall both frowned and gruntyd,
for that touched ther proffite, insomuch as Doctor Ihon Fisher bishop
of Rochester,The saiyug of I▪ Fisher B▪ of Rochester. saied openlie in the Parliament chambre these woordes:
my Lordes, you se daily what billes come hither from the commō house
and all is to the distruction of the churche, for Godes sake se what a
Realme the kyngdome of Boheme was, and when the Church went
doune, then fell the glory of the kyngdome, now with the Commons is
nothing but doune with the Church, and all this me semeth is for lacke
of faith only.
               When these wordes were reported to the Commons of the nether
house, that the bishop should say that all ther doynges were for lacke of
faith, thei toke the matter gre
                     •
                  ously, for thei Imagined that the bishop
estemed them as Heretikes, and so by his slaunderous woordes would
haue perswaded the temporall Lordes to haue restrained there consent
from the saied two billes, whiche thei before had passed, as you haue
hard before.
               Wherefore the Commons after long debate, determined to send the
speaker of the Parliament to the kinges highnes, with a greuous complaynt,
agaynst the bishop of Rochester, and so on a day when the kyng
was at layser,A complayne 
                        〈◊〉
                      to the kyng Thomas Audeley the speaker for the commons and
thirtie of the chief of the common house, came to the kynges presence
in his palace at Westminster, whiche before was called yorke place
and there very eloquently declared what a dishonour to the kyng and
the realme it was so say that thei which were elected for the wysest men
of all the She
                     ••
                  s 
                     〈◊〉
                  , and boroughes within the realme of Englād
shoulde be declared in so noble and open presence to lacke faith, whiche
was equiualent to say, that thei were Infidelles and no Christians, as

as Turkes or Sarasins, so that what payne or studie so euer thei toke
for the common wealth, or what actes or lawes so euer thei made or stablished,
shulde be taken as lawes made by Panyms and hethen people,
&amp; not worthi to be kept by christian men: wherfore he most hymbly besought
the kinges highnes, to cal the saied bishop before him &amp; to cause
him to speake more discretly of such a nombre as was in the cōmō house
               The kyng was not well contented with the saiyng of the bishop, yet
he gently answered the speaker, that he woulde send for the bishop and
send them worde what answere he made, and so thei departed agayne,
After this the kyng sent for the archebishope of Cauntorburie and sixe
other bishopes, and for the bishop of Rochester also, and there declared
to him the grudge of the commons,The, bishops excuse to the which the bishop answered
that he ment the doinges of the Bohemians was for lacke of faith, and
not the doynges of them that were in the common house, whiche saiyng
was confirmed by the bishopes being present, which had him in greate
reputaciō, and so by that only saiyng the kyng accepted his excuse and
therfore sent woord to the comons by sir william Fitz william knight
treasoror of his househoulde, which blind excuse pleased the commons
nothyng at all.
               After this diuers assemblies wer kept betwene certein of the lordes &amp;
certayne of the commons, for the billes of probates of Testamentes,
and the mortuaries: the temporaltie laied tot he spiritualtie ther awne
lawes and constitucions, and the spiritualtie sore defended them by prescripsion
and vsage, to whome an answere was made by a gentleman
of Greyes Inne: the vsage hath euer ben of theues to robbe on shoters
hill, ergo is it lawfull▪ with this answere the spirituall men were sore
offended, because there doynges were called robberies, but the temporall
men stode still by there saiynges, in so muche the saied gentle man
saied to the Archebishop of Cauntorburie, that both the exaccion of probates
of Testamentes, and the takyng of Mortuaries, as thei were vsed
were open robbery and theft: after long disputacion, the temporall
lordes began to leane to the cōmons, but for al that, the billes remayned
vnconcluded a while.
               In the meane season,The 
                        •
                     oane released there was a bill assented by the Lordes, and
sent doune to the commons, theffect wherof was, that the whole realme
by the saied acte, did release tot he kyng, all suche somes of money as
he had borowed of them at the loane, in the fiftene yere of his raigne (as
you haue hard before) this bill was sore argued in the common house
but the most parte of the commons were the kynges seruauntes, and
the other were so labored to by other, that the bill was assented to.
               When this realease of the loane was knowen to the commons of the
Realme, Lorde so thei grudged, and spake ill of the hole Parliament,
for almoste euery man counted it his dette, and reconed suerly of the

payment of the same, and therefore some made there willes of thesame,
and some other did set it ouer to other for debt, and so many men had
losse by it, which caused them sore to murmur, but ther was no remedy,
The kyng like a good and a discrete prince, seing that his commons in
the Parliament house had released the loane, entendyng somewhat to
requite thesame, graunted to them a generall Pardon, of all offences,
certayn great offences and debtes only except: also he aidid them for the
redresse of there greues against the spiritualtie, and caused two newe
billes to be made indifferently, both for the probate of Testamentes and
mor
                     •
                  uaries, which billes were so resonable that the spirituall lordes assented
to them all though thei were sore against there myndes, and in
especiall the probate of Testamentes sore displeased the bishopes, and
the mortuaries sore displeased the persones and vicars.
               After these Actes, thus agreed, the Commons, made a nother acte for
pluralitis, of benefices, none residence, biyng and selling and takyng of
f
                     •
                  rmes by spirituall persones, whiche acte so displeased the spiritualtie
that the priestes railed on the commons of the common house, and called
them heretikes and scismatikes, for the which diuerse priestes were
ponished.
               This acte was sore debated aboue in the parliament chambre, and
the Lordes spirituall woulde in nowise consent. Wherfore the kyng
perceiuing the grudge of his commons, caused eight lordes and eight
of his commons to mete in the starre chambre at an after none, and ther
was sore debatyng of the cause, insomuche that the temporall Lordes
of the vpper house, which were there, toke parte with the Commons, agaynst
the spirituall lordes and by force of reason caused them to assent
to the bil with a litle qualifiyng, whiche bill the nexte day was wholy a
greed to in the lordes house, to the great reioisyng of the lay people, and
to the greate displeasor of the spirituall persones.
               Duryng this Parliament was brought doune to the commons, the
boke of articles whiche the Lordes had put to the kyng agaynste the
Cardinall, the chief articles were these.
               First that he without the kynges assent had procured to be a Legate,
by reason whereof he toke away the right of all bishopes and spiritual
persones,
               Item, in all writynges which he wrot to Rome or any other foreyn
Prince, he wrot Ego et Rex meus, I and my kyng, as who woulde say that
the kyng were his seruaunt.
               Item, that he hath sclaundered the church of England in the courte
of Rome, for his suggestion to be legat was to reforme the churche of
Englande, which as he worte was F

Item, he without the kynges assent, caried the kynges great Seale,
withe hym into Flaunders when he was sent ambassad to the Emperoure,
               Item, he without the kynges assent, sent a commission to Sir Gregory
de Cassado, knighte, to conclude a league betwene the kyng and
the Duke of Farrar, without the kynges knowlege.
               Item that he hauyng the Frenche pockes presumed to come &amp; breth
on the kyng.
               Item, that he caused the Cardinalles hat to be put on the kynges
coyne.
               Item, that he woulde not suffer the kynges clarke of the market, to
sit at Sainct Talbons.
               Item, that he had sent innumerable substaunce to Rome, for the obteinyng
of his dignities to the greate enpouerishment of the realme,
               These Articles with many more, red in the common house, and signed
with the Cardinalles hande, was confessed by hym, &amp; also ther was
shewed a writyng sealed with his Seale, by the whiche he gaue to the
kyng all his mouables and vnmouables.
               On the day of the concepcion of oure Lady, the kyng at Yorke place
at Westminster, in the parliament tyme created the vicount Rochforth
Earle of Wilshire, and the vicount Fitzwater, was created Earle of
Sussex, and the Lorde Hastynges, was created Earle of Huntyngton.
               When althynges were concluded in the Parliament house, the kyng
came to the Parliament chambre the seuentene day of Decembre, and
there put his royall assent, to althynges done by the Lordes and commons,
and so proroged his court of Parliament, tyll the next yere.
               After the Parliament was thus ended, the kyng remoued to Grenewiche

                   of viaundes, and diuerse disguisynges and Enterludes,
to the greate reioisyng of his people.
               You haue harde before how the Emperour and the Pope was at
Bononie, wher the Emperour made great proparacion for the solempnisyng
of his coronacion, whiche was appoincted to be of Sainct Mathias
day, or the foure and twentie day of February, on whych day, he
was borne, and that day also the French kyng was taken, and because
that that day had ben euer fortunate to him he appoincted his coronacion
on that day: he apoincted it also at that place, because he woulde
the soner passe into Almayne, to appece suche striefes and debates as
was risen betwene the princes there.
               And so whā the day came &amp; euery thing was redy, he was crowned Emperor,
in the churche of. S. Peter, in the citie of Bononi by pope Clemēt
the .vii. with al the ceremonies therto belōging. At this coronaciō wer

present the Dukes of Sauoy and Millayn, duke Frederik brother to
the Palātine of Rine, and the deputies to all the seuen Electors and the
most parte of al the nobles of Italy, an Spayne. This coronacion
was done with great solemnities, there was feastyng, iustyng and torney,
and althinges that might sounde to honoure was there shewed,
bothe in apparell, and viaunde: and after that the Emperoure and the
Pope, with the hole college of Cardinalles, and al the noble men beyng
present rode in procession through the hie stretes of Bononi, with suche a
pompe and triumph as had not bene sene in Italy many yeres before.
               While the Emperour lay thus at Bononie, the kyng of Englande
was aduertised by his ambassadoures, whiche he had sent to diuers vniuersities
for the assoluyng of the doubte cōcernyng his mariage, that
the saied vniuersities wer agreed and had clerly concluded, that the one
brother to mary the other brothers wife, carnally knowne was directlie
against gods lawe, and that the pope nor the court of Rome could in no
wise dispence with the same.
               Wherefore the kyng knowyng themperour and the bishop of Rome
to be to gether at Bononie, determined to send thether asolempne ambassade,
both to declare to them the law of god, and the determinacion
of the vniuersities, and also to require the bishop of Rome to do Iustice
acco
                     ••
                  yng to the treuth, and also to shewe to the Emperoure that the
kyng did not moue this matter for any displeasure that he bare to him
or the quene his awnt, but only for the discharge of his conscience, and
for the quietnes of his Realme.
               When this purpose was agreed by the kynges counsayle, the kyng
appoincted Sir Thomas Bulleyne late created Earle of Wylshier
and Doctor Stoksley elected bishop of London, and Doctor, Edward
Lee, his almoner, two great Clarkes, for his ambassadours &amp; with them
he sēt diuers doctors both of the lawe &amp; diuinitie. These ambassadoures
made greate preparacion, and about the begynnyng of Februarie thei
set forward, and so muche thei trauailed that thei came to Sauoy wher
the Duke in the fayre toune of Cambrey, caused them honorably to bee
receiued and fested.
               So thei passed the Mountaynes, and so through the duchie of Millain
&amp; by long iorneis thei came to Bononie in lent, wher thei wer honorably
receiued by the master of the Emperoures house, and diuers Lordes
and Gentlemen belongyng to the Pope, and within short space the
saied ambassadoures were first conueighed to the Pope, and there
declared ther message and shewed the determinacion of the great Doctors
and famous vniuersities. Pope Clement whiche was a man of
no learnyng but of a great wit made to them a gentle answere,The Pop
                        •
                     s an
                        •
                     wear. and saied
that he woulde here the matter disputed when he came to Rome

and according to right he woulde do Iustice. But his entent was
al contrarie, for he knew wel that if he should geue sentence, that Pope
Iuly coulde not dispence with the breache of Godes lawe, that then the
aucthoritie of the courte of Rome would litle be regarded, and also he
feared the Emperours displeasure if he shoulde geue sentence againste
his awnte, so that for feare of losing aucthoritie, &amp; of themperors displeasure,
bishop Clement, durst no
                     •
                   Iudge according to goddes lawe.
After thei had bene with the Pope, thei came to the Emperour, whiche
them gently receiued, and after thei had done their message, he answered
them that he in no wise would be agaynst the lawe of God, and if
the court of rome would adiudge that the matrimonie were not good, he
would be cōtēt, but he thought al otherwise, for he solicited the pope &amp; al
the Cardinalles which wer his frendes to stād by the dispēsaciō, which
he iudged to be as strong as goddes law. After this answere thei toke
ther leaue of the Emperor, which the nexte weke after departed out of
Bononie towarde Almayne in good ordre of battail, he him selfe in gilt
harnes, and his nobles in white harnes with riche cotes and trappers
very curiously besene.
               After that themperour was gon out of Bononie, the ambassadoures
of England toke there leaue of the bishop of Rome, which went toward
Rome agayne, and retorned toward England, through the Duchy of
Millayn, whiche was receiued by the Earle Lodouick, greate counsaylor
to the Duke of Millain, which earle cōducted them through the
whole Duchie of Millayne, &amp; paied al their charges by the dukes cōmaūdemēt.
And whē these ambassadors wer passed the mountaynes, thei
receiued letters frō the kyng, which appoincted the Earle of Wilshire
to go ambassade to the Frenche king, which then lay at Burdeaux makyng
prouision for money for the redemyng of his children: and the bishop
of London was appoyncted to go to Padua, and other vniuersities
in Italy to know ther opinions in the kynges cace, and the kinges
almoner was apoincted to retorne into Englād, and so he did, thus was
the end of this ambassad.
               You haue hard before how the Cardinall was attainted in the premunire
and how he was put out of the office of the chauncelor and lay
at Asher: In this Lent season the kyng by the aduice of his counsayle
licenced him to go into his diocesse of 
                     •
                  orke, and gaue him commaundemēt
to kepe hym in his diocesse and not to returne southwarde without
the kynges speciall licence in writyng.
               So he made great great prouision to go northwarde and appareled
his seruauntes newly &amp; bought many costely thinges for his houshold
&amp; so he might wel inough,Thomas cromwel came in to the kynges seruice. for he had of the kynges gētlenes the bishopprickes
of yorke &amp; Winchester, which wer no small thinges, but at this
time diuers of his seruaūtes departed from him to the kynges seruice,

and in especiall Thomas Crumwel one of his chief counsayle and chefe
doer for him in the suppressiō of abbeis. After that al thinges necessarie
for his iornay wer prepard, he toke his iorney northward til he came to
Southwel which is in his dioces &amp; ther he cōtinued this yere, euer grudging
at his fall as you shall here after: but the lādes which he had geuē
to his Colleges in Oxforde &amp; Ypswych, were now come to the kynges
handes, by his atteinder in the premunire, and yet the kyng of his gentlenes
and for fauour that he bare to good learnyng erected agayne the
College in Oxford, and where it was named the Cardinalles College,
he called it the kynges College, and endewed it with faire possessions,
and put in newe statutes and ordinaunces, and for because the College
of Ypswich was thought to be nothing proffitable, therefore he lefte
that dissolued.
               The last Somer while the peace was treated at Cambray as you
haue hard before▪ Ferdinando brother to the Emperour, recouered certayne
tounes which the Turkes had taken from hym in Hyngry, and
put to flighte his ennemy Ihon the Uainoda, whiche falsly named him
selfe kyng of Hungary. This Uainoda destitute of all succoure fled
to Sultan Soliman the great Turke, desiryng hym of succor, to recouer
Hungry a gaiue. The Turke being glad to haue an occasion to distroy
Hungry, assembled a puissan
                     •
                  t army, and entred into Hungry, and
made proclamacion that what toune or Citie woulde not obey kyng
Ihon as ther kyng, should be put to fire and sworde. This proclamacion
so fearid the Hūgarians, that al in maner yelded thē self subiectes to
the Uainoda, the citie of Bude onely except: whych at the last was yelden,
by composicion that the
                     •
                   shuld depart with bag and baggage, but
for al there safe conduit signed withe the great Turkes hand, thei were
firste robbed of the Ian
                     •
                  zeres, and after that shamfully slain,
               When the Turke had thus Bude in possession, he left there the Uainoda,Crueltie of y• Turkes,
and Lewes great bastard sonne to the Duke of Uenice, with fiue
thousand fotemen, and two thousand horsmen, and he with all haste entered
into Austrice, wher his people committed such crueltie and tiranny,
as neuer hath been hard nor written, for of some thei put out the eies
of other thei cut of the noses and eares, of other thei cut of the priuy mē
                  bers,
of women thei cut of the pappes, and rauished Uirgins and of
women great with child, thei cut ther bellies and brent the children: beside
this as thei passed thei brent corne, trees, howses, and al that would
be brent to make the contry desolate, and at the last the two and twentie
day of Septembre, the turkes armie came nye to Uienne, a riche and a
famous Citie in Austrice.
               The fame was that he had two hundreth and fiftie thousande men
in his armie, and fiue and twentie thousande tentes in the sighte of the
citie.
               At the beginnyng of the siege certein Christian men were taken of
the Turkes, which turkes cut of the heddes of foure lepers in a lazer

cote, without the citie &amp; put them vpon poles, &amp; made christen prisoners
presēt thē to the great turk, which therof toke great ioy: of y• which prisoners
he released certain and bad them go to the captaynes and to tell
thē that if thei would yeld the citie of hym, thei should depart with bag
and bagage, and if thei would kepe it by force, by woulde suerly haue it
&amp; put thē al to the sword. Now in the citie was captayn duke Phillip
of Bauier, Earle Palantine of the Rine, and nephew to the Palsgraue
elector, a young man, but of noble corage, and with him were twentie
thousand Almaynes, and two thousand horsemē, which nothing feared
the Turkes threatnynges. The Turke perceiuyng ther boldnes bent
his grete ordinaunce, which were thre hundreth peces a gaynst the walles,
and commaundyd the towne to be assauted: the Turkes gaue a
greate assaut, but the christen men valiantly defended them, so that the
Turkes were compelled to fle, and many of them were slaine,.
               The fourth day of Octobre, the Turke bent all his Ordinaunce against
the wal, which so shoke the wal that al men within supposed that
the walles would haue fallen doune, but thei did litle harme, which was
sone amendid. The sixt day of Octobre, eight thousand christen men issued
out of the toune, and came wher the Turkes miners wer working
and slew a gret nombre &amp; destroyed the mines. The same dai the Turkes
gaue a great assaute to the citie: the christyan men valiantly
them defended, and threw downe great loggs and barres of Iron, and
slew many Turkes. Thus the Turkes assauted the citie a leuen times,
&amp; somany times they wer betē away, but the great &amp; terrible assaut
was the twelue day of Octobre, at which assaut the christyan men so valiantly
defended them selfe and slewe and hurt so many of the Turkes,
that after that day, for no commandement that the Turke could geue,
they woulde nomore geue assaute.
               The Turke perceiued well bothe the strength of the Citie and the
corage of the capitaines with in, and also the winter there was muche
more colder then in his contreys, which sore troubled hym and his people,
wherfore he called his counsail and concluded to breake vp his siege
and to departe, &amp; so the fouretene day of Octobre he shot greate stones
into the citie all day till night
                     •
                   and a boute tenne of the clok in the
night he caused his tentes to be takē vp, and 
                     〈◊〉
                   fire on the strawe, and
such other stuffe, and so remoued al his armie, towarde Bude, sauing
fiftie thousande horsemen whiche taried all the next day behynde, cariyng
with hym a greate nombre of Christyan prisoners, whiche he put
to the mines and suche other vile seruice.
               At this siege the Turke loste by Murder,The numbre of the turkes that died Sicknes, and cold, aboue
fourescore thousande men, as one of his bassates did afterwarde confesse.
               Thus was the citie of Uienne defended a gaynst the greate Turke,
and all his power whiche was to him a greate displeasure, and in especially
because he n

               The .xxii. yere
               
                  IN the begynnyng of this two and twentie yere, the kyng
like a politike &amp; a prudent prince, perceiued that his subiectes
and other persons had diuers times within foure
yeres last past, brought into his realme, greate nombre of
printed bokes, of the new Testament, translated into the
English tongue by Tyndall, Ioy, and other, which bokes the common
people vsed and dayly red priuely, which the clargie would not admit,
for thei punnished suche persones as had red, studied or taught thesame
with greate extremitie, but bycause the multitude was so greate, it was
not in their power to redresse there grefe: wherfore they made complaint
to the Chauncelor (which leaned much to the spirituall mennes part, in
all causes) where vpon he imprisoned and punished a greate nomber, so
that for this cause a great rumor and controuersie rose daily emongest
the people: wherfore the kyng cōsideryng what good might come of readyng
of the new Testament with reuerence and folowyng thesame, and
what euell mighte come of the readyng of thesame if it were euil
translated, and not folowed: came into the starre chambre the
fiue and twentie day of May, and there commoned with his counsaile
and the prelates cōcernyng this cause, and after long debatyng, it was
alleged that the translacion of Tyndall and Ioy were not truely translated,
and also that in them were prologues and prefaces which sounded
to heresie,The newe testamēt 
                        •
                     orbidden, and rayled against the bishopes vncharitably, wherefore
all suhe bokes were prohibited and commaundemēt geuen by the kyng
to the bishoppes, that thei callyng to them the best learned men of the vniuersities
should cause a new translacion to be made, so that the people
should not be ignoraunte in the law of god: And notwithstandyng this
commaundement the bishopes did nothing at all to set furth a new trā
                  slaciō,
which caused the people to stody Tindalles translacion, by reasō
where of many thinges cam to light, as you shall here after.
               In this yere in Maye, the bishop of Londō caused al his newe Testamētes
which he had bought with many other bokes, to be brought
into Paules churcheyarde in London and there was openly burned,
               In the ende of this yere, the wilde Irishmen knowyng the Earle of
Ki
                     •
                  dare to be in England▪ entred his lande, and spoyled and brent his

coūtrey, and diuers other contreyes, and the Earle of Ossery beyng the
kynges deputie made litle resistaunce, for lacke of power, wherfore the
kyng sent the erle of Kyldare into Ireland, and with him sir Wyllyam
Skeuyngton knight, Master of the kynges ordinaunce and diuers
Gunners with him, whiche so pollitickly ordered them selfe that their
enemyes were glad to offre amendes and to treate for turce, and so sir
Wyllyam Skeuyngton the nexte yere returned into England leuyng
there the Erle of Kyldare for the kynges deputie.
               Now I wyll returne to y• execucion of the treatie of Cambray in the
whiche it was agreed that the Lady Elianor and the Frenche kynges
children should be deliuered when the raunsome appointed was paied
as you haue heard in the last yere: Wherfore ye Frenche kyng gathered
money of his subiectes wt all spede, and when the money was ready he
sent the great Master of Fraunce called Annas de Memorancye and

                     〈◊〉
                   other nobles to Bayon with the money, and to receiue the lady
and the children. And thither came to them the great Constable of Castle
and Mounsire Prat for the Emperor, and there the crounes were
wayed and touched, and what fault soeuer the Spanyardes found in
them thei would not receiue a great nomber of them, and so they caried
the children backe frō Foūtraby into Spayne. Thus the great master
of Fraunce and his company lay styll at Bayon without hauyng his
purpose performed from Marche till the ende of Iune, and lenger had
lyen i
                     •
                   y• kyng of England had not sent sir Fraunces Bryan to Bayon
to warrant the payment: wherevpon the day of deliueraunce was appointed
to be on sainct Peters day in Iune. At whiche day the great
Master with xxxi. Mulettes laden with the crounes came to y• one sydeThe deliueraunce of the Frenche kynges children.
of the riuer of Auday whiche riuer departeth Spayne and Fraunce &amp;
there taried till the first day of Iuly: on whiche day the lady Elianor &amp;
the children were put in two great boates, hauyng onely xii. gentlemen
of Spayne with them: and in like maner the great Master with two
great boates in the which the money was and xii. gentlemen with him.
All these boates met at a brydge made in the middes of the riuer: The
Constable of Spayn and his xii. gentlemen met with the great Master
of Fraunce and his xii. gentlemen on the bridge, and after a litle salutacion
the Frenchemen entered into the ii. boates where the Lady and the
two children were, and the Spanyardes into the two boates where the
money was, and then eche part hasted to land. Thus were the Frenche
kynges wife and children deliuered into his handes, for whiche deliueraunce
was great ioy &amp; triumph made in Fraunce: &amp; also in Iuly were
fyers made in London &amp; diuers other places for thesame consideracion
and cause.
               The Emperor as you haue heard the last yere, passed out of Italy into
Germany and was receiued with great honor and triumph into the
citie of Ausborough or August, where in Iune were present all the electors

and almoste all the princes of the Empyre: there was kept a great
counsail for the princes of Germany were of two seueral opinions and
of seueral names, the part that fauored the pope and all thynges done
by his aucthoritie were called Catholical, and the other part whiche folowed
and preached onely the fospel of Christ were called euangclical.
Of these and other thynges concernyng our fayth there wer many coū
                  sailes:
but Cardinal Campeius the Popes legate would not suffer the
Euangelical persones (whom he called Lutherans) to argue against y•
Catholical men (whō y• Euāgelical persons called papystes) lest by the
openyng of the scripture the authoritie of ye court of Rome should haue
been bamned, and therfore the Emperor put of the matter till another
tyme: But this matter was not so let slyppe, for of this mocion men so
serched the law of God that within a few yeres after, many people refused
the Pope for the head of the Churche and forsoke him and his pardons.
               On the xix. day of September in the citie of Lōdon was made this
Proclamacion.A proclamacion. 
                  The kynges highnes straytly chargeth and cōmaundeth
that no maner of person of what estate, degree or condicion soeuer
he or they be of, do purchase or attempt to puchase frō y• court of Rome
or els where, nor vse &amp; put in execucion, diuulge, or publishe any thyng

containyng matter preiudicial to the high aucthoritie, iurisdiccion
and prerogatiue royal, of this his sayd realme, or to the let, hynderaūce
or impechement of his graces noble and vertuous entended purposes

imprisonment &amp; farther punishement of their bodies for their so doyng
at his graces pleasure, to the dreadfull example of all other.
               
               This Proclamacion was muche mused at and euery woorde of the
same well noted. Some sayd that it was made because that the quene
had purchased a new Bull for the ratificacion of her mariage, other
sayd that it was made because the Cardinall had purchased a Bull to
curse the kyng i

with the

                  ame. This inuencion sounded moste to the trueth as you
shall heare afterward.
               In October the riuer of Tyber was of such an heigth that in Rome
and other places about Rome almoste xii.M. persons were drouned, &amp;
in the next moneth zeland, Holland and Brabant were sore noyed with
waters and many people and muche cattel were drouned.
               You haue heard in the last yere how the Cardinall of Yorke was attainted
in the premunire and that notwithstanding the king had geuen
him the b

                  oprickes of yorke and Wynchester with great plentie of
substaunce, and had licēsed him to lye in his dioces of Yorke. He beyng
this in his dioces grudgyng at his fall &amp; not remembryng the kynges

kyndnes shewed to him, wrote to the court of Rome and to diuers other
princes letters in reproche of the kyng, and in as muche as in him
lay, he stirred them to reuenge his cause against the kyng and his
realme, insomuche that diuers opprobrious wordes of the kyng were
spoken to doctor Edward Keerne the kynges Orator at Rome, and it
was sayd to him that for the Cardinals sake, the kyng should haue the
worse spede in the suite of his matrimony.The pryde of the Cardinal, The Cardinal also would
speake fayre to the people to wynne their heartes and declared euer
that he was vniustly and vntruely ordered, whiche fayre speakyng
made many mē beleue that he sayd true: and to gētlemen he gaue great
giftes to allure them vnto him: And to be had in the more reputacion
among the people he determined to be installed or inthronised at yorke
with al the pompe that might be, and caused a trone to be erected in the
Cathedral church in suche an heigth and fashiō as was neuer seen, and
sent to all the lordes, Abbo

of his dioces, to be at his Manor of Cawod the vi. day of Nouember
and so to bryng him to yorke with all maner of pompe and
solempnitie.
               The kyng whiche knewe his doynges and priuye conueyaunce, all
this yere dissembled the matter to see what he would do at length, till
that he saw his proude heart so high exalted that he would be so triumphantly
installed without makyng the kyng priuye, yea and in maner
in disdayne of the kyng, thought it not mete nor conuenient to suffer
him any lenger to continue in his malicious and proude purposes and
attemptes: wherfore he directed his letters to Henry the vi. erle of Northumberland,
willyng him with al diligence to arrest the Cardinal and
to deliuer him to therle of Shrewsbury great stewarde if the kynges
housholde: When the erle had seen the letter, he with a cōuenient nomber
came to the Manor of Cawod the iiii. day of Nouember, and when
he was brought to the Cardinal in his chamber, he sayd to him, my lord
I pray you take pacience,The Cardinal arreste
                        •
                     . for here I arrest you. Arrest me sayd ye Cardinal,
yea sayd the erle I haue a commaundement so to do: you haue no
suche power sayd the Cardinal, for I am both a Cardinal and a Legate
de Latere and a pere of the College of Rome &amp; oughtnot to be arrested
by any temporal power, for I am not subiect to that power, wherfore if
you arrest me I will withstand it: well sayd the erle, here is the kynges
Commission (whiche he shewed him) and therfore I charge you to obey,
the Cardianl somewhat remembred himselfe and sayd, well my lorde, I
am content to obey, but although that I by negligence fell into the punishement
of the Premunire and lost by the lawe all my landes and
goodes, yet my person was in the kynges proteccion and I was pardoned
that offence, wherfore I meruail why I nowe should be arrested &amp;
specially consideryng that I am a mamber of the sea Apostolike on
whō no temporal man ought to lay violent handes, wel I see the kyng

lacketh good counsail: well sayd the erle when I was sworne Warden
of the Marches, you your self tolde me that I might with my staffe arrest
all men vnder the degree of a kyng▪ and nowe I am more stronger
for I haue a cōmission so to do whiche you haue seen. The Cardinal at
length obeyed and was kept in his priuie chamber and his goodes seazed
and his officers discharged, and his Phisician called doctor Augustyne
was lykewise arrested and brought to the Tower by sir Walter
Welshe one of the kynges chamber. The vi. day of Nouember he was
cōueyed from Cawod to Sheffelde castle and there deliuered to therle
of Shrewsburies kepyng till the kynges pleasure were knowen: Of
this attachement was muche commonyng amongest the common people,
wherfore many were glad, for surely he was not in the fauor of the
cominaltie.
               When the Cardinall was thus arrested the kyng sent sir Wyllyam
Kyngston knight capitaine of the Garde and Constable of the Tower
of London with certain of the yomen of the Gard to Sheffeld to fetche
the Cardinal to the Tower. When the Cardinal sawe the capitaini of
the garde, he was sore astonnyed and shortly became sicke, for then he
perceiued some great trouble towarde him, and for that cause men sayd
that he willyngly toke so muche quātitie of strong purgacion that his
nature was not able to beare it: but sir Wylliam Kyngston comforted
him, and by easy iornayes he brought him to the Abbay of Lecester the
xxvii. day of Nouember,The Cardinal dead and buried at Leycester. where for very feblenes of nature caused by
purgacions and vomites he dyed the second night folowyng, and in
the same abbay lyeth buryed. This Cardinal as you may perceiue in
this story was of a great stomacke, for he compted himselfe egall with
princes, and by craftie suggestion gatte into his handes innumerable
treasure:The discrip
                     
                        •
                     ion of the Cardinal. He forced litle on symony &amp; was not pityful and stode affeccionate
in his owne opinion: In open presence he would lye and say vntruth
and was double both in speche and meanyng: He would promise
muche and performe lytle: He was vicious of his body and gaue the
clergie euil example: He hated sore the citie of London and feared it: It
was told him that he should dye in the way toward London▪ wherfore
he feared lest the cōmons of the citie would arise in riotous maner and
so sley him, yet for all that he dyed in the waye towarde London. The
authoritie of this Cardinal set the clergie in suche a pryde that thei disdained
all men, wherfore when he was fallen they folowed after as you
shall heare. To write the life and doynges of this Cardinal, it were a
great worke, but whatsoeuer he did God forgeue his soule his bodyes
misdedes.
               After the Cardinal was dead, the kyng remoued frō Hampton court
to Grenewiche where he with quene Katherine kept a solempne Christmas,
and on the twelfe night he satte in the halle in his estate, where as
were diuers Enterludes, riche Maskes and disportes, and after that

a great banket. And after Christmas he came to his Manor of Westminster,
whiche before was called yorke place, for after that the Cardinal
was attainted in the Premunire &amp; was gone Northward, he made
a feoffement of thesame place to the kyng, and the chapiter of the Cathedral
churche of Yorke by their writyng cōfirmed thesame feoffement
and then then kyng chaūged the name and called it the kynges Manor
of Westminster and nomore Yorke place.
               The whole clergie of England euer supported and maintayned the
power legantyne of the Cardinal, wherfore the kynges counsail learned
sayed plainly that they all were in the Premunire, the spiritual lordes
were called by proces into the kynges Benche to answere, but before
their day of apperaunce they in their Conuocacion concluded an
humble submission in writyng and offered the kyng a C. M. pound to
be their good lorde, and also to geue them a pardon of all offences touchyng
the Premunire by act of Parliament, ye whiche offer with muche
labor was accepted, and their pardon promised. In this submission the
Clergie called the kyng supreme head of ye churche of England,The kyng first named supreme head. whiche
thyng they neuer confessed before, wherevpon many thinges folowed
after as you shall heare.
               When the Parliament was begōne the vi. day of Ianuary, the pardon
of the spiritual persones was signed with the kynges hande &amp; sent
to the lordes, whiche in tyme conuenient assented tot he bill and sent it
to the cōmons in the lower house, and when it was red, diuers froward
persones would in no wyse assent to it except all menne were pardoned,
saiyng that all men whiche had any thyng to do with the Cardinal wer
in the same case: the wyser sort answered that they would not compell
the kyng to geue them his pardon, and beside that it was vncharitably
done of them to hurt the Clergie and do themselfes no good, wherfore
they aduised them to consent to the bill and after to sue to the kyng for
their pardon, whiche counsail was not folowed, but they determined
first to sende the Speaker to the kyng or they would assent to the bill,
whervpon Thomas Audely spekar for the commons with a cōuenient
nomber of the common house came to the kynges presēce and there eloquently
declared to the kyng how the commons sore lamented and bewayled
their chaunce to thynke or imagyne them selfes to be out of his
gracious fauor, because that he had graciously geuen his pardon of the
Premunire to his spiritual subiectes and not to them, wherefore they
moste humbly besought his grace of his accustomed goodnes and clemency
to include them in thesame pardon.
               The kyng wisely answered that he was their prince and soueraigne
lorde &amp; that they ought not to restraine him of his libertie, nor to cōpel
him to shewe his mercy, for it was at his pleasure to vse the extremitie
of his lawes, or mitigate and pardon thesame, wherfore, sith thei denied
to assent to the pardon of the spiritual persones, whiche pardon he sayd

he might geue without their assent by his great seale, he would be well
aduised or he pardoned them, because he would not be noted to be compelled
to do it: with this answere the speaker and the commons departed
very sorowful and pensiue and some light persones sayd that Thomas
Crumwell whiche was newly come to the fauor or the kyng had
disclosed the secretes of the commons, whiche thing caused the kyng to
be so extreme.
               The kyng like a good prince considered how sorowfull his cōmons
were of the answere that he made them, and thought that they were not
quiet, wherfore of his owne mocion he caused a pardon of the Premunire
to be drawen, and signed it with his hand and sent it to the comon
house by Christopher Hales his atturnay, whiche bill was sone assented
to. Then the commons louyngly thāked the kyng and muche praised
his witte that he had denyed it to them when they vnworthely demaunded
it, and had bountyfully graunted it when he perceiued that
they sorowed and lamented.
               While the Parliamene sat, of the xxx. day of Marche at after noone
there came into the common house the lorde Chauncelor and diuers
lordes of the spiritualtie and temporaltie to the nomber of xii. and there
the lorde Chauncelor sayd, you of this worshipfull house I am sure be
not so ignorant but you know well that the kyng our soueraigne lorde
hath maried his brothers wife, for she was both wedded &amp; bedded with
his brother prince Arthur, and therfore you may surely say that he hath
maried his brothers wyfe, if this mariage be good or no many clerkes
do doubt. Wherfore the kyng like a vertuous prince willyng to be satisfied
in his conscience and also for the suretie of his realme hath with
great deliberacion consulted with great clerkes, and hath sent my lord
of London here present to the chiefe vniuersities of all Chirstendome
to knowe their opinion and iudgement in that behalfe, And although
that the vniuersities of Cambryge and Oxforde had been sufficient to
discusse y• cause, yet because they be in his realme and to auoyde all suspicion
of parcialitie he hath sent into the realme of Fraunce, Italy the
Popes dominions, and Uenicians to knowe their iudgement in that
bahalfe, whiche haue cōcluded, written and sealed their determinacions
accordyng as you shall heare red. Then sir Bryan Tuke toke out of a
boxe xii. writynges sealed, &amp; red them worde by worde as after ensueth

                  Not long syns there were put forth to vs the College of doctors, regentes
of the vniuersitie of Orliaunce,Orleaunce these two questions that folow.
The fyrst, whether it be lawfull by the lawe of God for the brother to
take to wyfe that woman whom his brother hath left? The second if
this be forbidden by the lawe of God, whether this prohibicion of the

lawe of God may be remitted by the Pope his dispensacion? We the
foresayd College of doctors regentes accordyng to our custome and vsage
came many tymes together and did sit diuers tymes vpon the discussyng
of these foresayd doubtes and questions and did examyne and
way as muche as we might diuers &amp; many places both of the old testament
and newe, and also the interpreters and declarers both of the law
of God and the Canon lawe. After we had wayed and considered all
thynges exactly and with good leysure and deliberaciō, we haue determined
and cōcluded that these foresayd mariages cannot be attempted
nor enterprised except a man do wrong and plaine contrary to the lawe
of God: yea and that although it be done by pardon and sufferaunce of
the Pope. And in witnes of this cōclusion and determinacion we haue
caused this present publike writyng to be signed by our Scribe of our

vniuersitie of Parys this question. Whither that the Pope might dispence,
that the brother might mary the wyfe that his brother hath left,
if mariage betwene his brother now dead and his wyfe were once consummate?
we the Deane and College of the sayd facultie after many
disputacions and reasons made of bothe sydes vpon this matter and
after great and long turnyng and serchyug of bokes, bothe of the lawe
of God and the Popes lawe and of the lawe Ciuil, we counsail and say

lawe of God and the lawe of nature for a man to mary the wyfe of his
brother that is departed without children so that the mariage was
consummate? And againe whether it is lawfull for the Pope to dispence
with suche mariage? We the aforesayd Rector and doctors haue

accordyng to our custome and vsage many tymes communed together
and sytten to dispute these questions, and to fynde out the certaintie
of them. And after that we had discussed and examined many &amp; diuers
places aswell of the lawe of God as of the law of man, whiche semed to
pertaine to the same purpose, and after that we had brought for bothe
parties and examined them. All thinges faythfully and after good cō
                     science
considered and vpon sufficient deliberacion and auisement taken,
we defyne and determyne that neither by the lawe of God nor of
nature it is permitted for any christen man, no not euen with the authoritie
of the sea Apostolike, or with any dispensacion graunted by the
Pope to mary the wyfe that his brother hath left, although his brother
be departed without children, after that the mariage is once finished

of late there is risen a great controuersie of great difficultie vpon the
mariage betwene the moste noble Henry the viii. kyng of England defendor
of the fayth and lorde of Ireland. &amp;c. and the noble lady Katherine
quene of England, doughter to the Catholike kyng Ferdinand,
whiche mariage was not onely contract betwene her and her former
husband, but also consummate and finished by carnall intermedelyng.
This question also was purposed to vs to discusse and examine accordyng
to iustice and trueth, that is to say, whether to mary her that our
brother dead without children hath left beyng so prohibited by the law
of God and nature, that it can not be made lefull by the Popes dispensacion,
that any Christen manne should mary the wyfe that his brother
hath left? We the foresayd Deane and facultie callyng to our remembraunce
how vertuous and how holy a thing and how agreable to our
profession, vnto our dutie of loue and charitie, it is for vs to shewe
the waye of iustice and right, of vertue and honestie to them whiche desire
to leade and passe ouer their life in the law of our Lord with sure &amp;
quiet conscience: could not but be ready to satisfie so honest and iust requestes:
whervpon after our old wont, we came together vpō our othe
in the churche of S. Maturyne, &amp; there for thesame cause had a solēpne
Masse with deuout prayer to the holy ghost. And also we toke an othe

be to the pleasure of God and accordyng to cōscience: And after diuers

that the foresayd mariage with the brothers wife departyng without
children be so forbidden both by the law of God and of nature that
the pope hath no power to dispence wt suche mariages whether they be

all the beloued of God, among whom you moste dere readers vnto
whom we write be called, grace, peace and quietnes of conscience come
to you from God the father and from our Lorde Iesu Christ: while we
were gathered together all into one place (in the octaues of Whitsontide)
both in body and mynde, and were sittyng in the house of the sayd
deane, there was a question put to vs againe, whiche had been purposed
to vs often tymes before, beyng no smal question, whiche was this:
Whither the brother takyng the wife of his brother now dead, and the
mariage once consummate and perfite doeth a thyng vnlawfull or no?
At the last when we had sought for the trueth of the thing and had perceiued
and founde it our by muche labor and studye of euery one of vs
by himselfe, and by muche and often turnyng of holy bookes, euery one
of vs not corrupt, wherby we might the lesse obey the trueth, began as
the holy gost did put in his minde to geue euery man one arbitrement &amp;
sentence which was this. I haue well perceiued in very truth wtout regard
or respect of any person that those persones whiche be rehersed in y•

any authoritie of any manne by the whiche there is made an abhominable
discouering of his brothers foulnes. And this is the signe of our

                  The determinacion of the diuines in the popes
vniuersitie of Bonony.
                  God best and mightiest taught fyrst the olde lawe &amp; testament with
his owne mouth,Bonony. to forme and fashion accordyng to loue and charitie,
the maners and life of men. And secondarely the same God did take afterwardes
manhod vpon him for to be the redemer of man and so made
the new lawe or newe Testament not onely to forme and fashion accordyng
to loue and charitie the life and maners of men, but also to take
away and to declare doubtes the whiche did arise in many cases, which
when they be once clerely determined shall helpe greatly to perfite vertue
and goodnes, that is to say, to perfite loue and charitie. Wherfore
we thought it euermore, that it should be our part to folowe these moste
holy doctrines and lawes of our father of heauen, and that we lightned
by the light of God aboue and of the holy ghost should geue our sentence
and iudgement in high and doubtfull matters after that we haue
once leyserly and sufficiently taken aduisement vpon the cause, &amp; haue
clerely serched out and opened the thing by many reasons &amp; writynges
of holy fathers aswell for the one part as for the other, doyng nothyng
as nere as we can rashly or without deliberacion. Therfore where certaine
great and noble men did instantly desire vs that we would with
al diligence possible loke for this case that after ensueth, and afterwardes
to geue our iudgement vpon thesame, accordyng to moste equitie,
right, and conscience, stickyng ouely to the trueth: All the doctors of
diuinitie of this Uniuersitie, when we had euery one by himselfe examined
the matter at home in our houses, came all together into one
place and there treated vpon it many dayes with asmuche connyng
&amp; learnyng as we could, we anon loked on the case together, we examined
it together, we compared all thyng together, we handelyng euery
thing by it selfe, did trye them euen as you would say by lyne and rule,
we brought forth all maner of reasons, whiche we thought could be
brought for the contrary part, and afterward solued them yea euen the

shortly all other maner of reasons &amp; opinions of ye cōtrary part, as many

as semed to belong to this purpose, and this question that was asked
of vs was this: Whether it was forbydden onely by the ordinaunce of
the churche or els by the law of God, that a manne might not mary the
wyfe left of his brother departed without children? and if it were commaunded
by both the lawes not to be done, whether the Pope may dispence
with any man to make suche mariage? the whiche question nowe
that we haue examined it bothe by our selfe secretely and also openly &amp;
diligently and exactly as we could possible, and discussed it after ye best
maner that our wittes would serue: we determyne, geue iudgement and
say, and as stifly as we can we witnes and without any doubt do stedfastly
hold that this mariage should be horrible, accursed &amp; to be cryed
out vpon and vtterly abhominable not onely for a christen mā but for
an infidele, vnfaythfull or heathen, And that it is prohibite vnder greuous
paynes and punishementes by the lawe of God, of nature and of
man, &amp; that the Pope, though that he almoste may do all thinges, vnto
whom Christ did geue the keyes of the kyngdome of heauen, hath no
power to geue a dispensacion to any man for to contract suche a mariage
for any maner of cause, consideracion or suggestion: And all we be

                  They that haue written for the maintenaunce of the catholike fayth,
affirme that God best and mightiest did geue the preceptes &amp; cōmaundementes
of the olde lawe with his owne mouthe, to be an exampler for
vs, wherein we might see how we should order our life and maners,
and this God had done before he became manne: and after that he
had put vpon him our manhod and was become redemer or byer of
mankynde, He made the newe lawe or testament, and of his mere liberalitie
did geue it vs, not onely for the cause aforesayd, but also to take
away &amp; declare all maner of doubtes and questions that might arise,
the whiche once opened &amp; declared what their very true meanyng is, to
thentent that therby we might be made perfitely good which be greatly
fruitful to vs &amp; holesome: and seyng that this was the mind of God in
making these lawes, it hath been our entent &amp; euermore shalbe, as it becōmeth
christen men to folow these moste solēpne ordinaūces of ye most
high workemaster God, &amp; the help of his light, y• is aboue the capacitie
of nature, to vtter our iudgement in all maner of doubtes &amp; harde questions.

After we had once considered the thing after the best maner, and
had by sufficient leysure made it clere by many euident reasons of both
parties, and by many aucthorities of the fathers of the Churche, determinyng
nothyng as nere as wer can, rashely or without conuenient deliberacion.
Seyng therfore that certain great Orators or ambassadors
did humbly require and pray vs that we would vouchesafe and serche
out with al the diligence that we could this case folowyng &amp; afterwardes
to geue our sentence vpon the same, plainly &amp; simply lokyng onely
on the trueth. After the Doctors of diuinitie of this Uniuersitie came
together, and after that we had euery man examined the thing particulerly
in our owne houses and haue beaten it with all learnyng and connyng
that we were able: Anon when we wer together, we considered, examined
and wayed all thinges by them selfes, and brought in al maner
of reasons, whiche we thought might by any meanes be made to the cō
                     trary,
and without all colour or cloke did wholy &amp; clerely dissolue them
and take them away. And amongest al, the dispensacion by the lawe of
Deut
                        •
                     ronomi of styrryng vp the brothers sede, and al maner other reasons
a
                        •
                     d determinacions to the contrarye, that semed to vs to pertaine
any thyng to that purpose we vtterly confuted &amp; dispatched them. And
the question that is put to vs is this: Whether to mary the wife of our
brother departed without children is forbidden onely by y• lawe of the
Churche or by ye lawe of God also: and if it be forbidden by both these
lawes, whither the Pope may dispence wt any mā for suche matrimony
or no? whiche question now that we haue discussed it, &amp; as farre as we
could, haue made it clere, both priuately euery man by him selfe, &amp; after
al togethers opēly, we say, iudge, decree, witnes &amp; for a trueth affirme y•
suche mariage is no mariage, yea and that it is abhorred and cursed of
euery christen man, and to be abhominate as a greuous sinne. And that
it is as clearely as can be forbidden vnder moste cruel penalties by the
lawes of nature, of God and of man: And that the Pope, vnto whom y•
keyes of the kyngdome of heauen be committed by Christ the sonne of
God, hath no power to dispence by the right and law for any cause, suggestion
or excuse, that any suche matrimonye should be contract. For
those thinges whiche be forbidden by the law of God be not vnderneth
his power but aboue it, nor he is not the Uicar of God as concernyng
those thinges, but onely in suche thynges as God hath not determined
himselfe in his lawe, but hath lefte them to the determinacion and ordinaunce
of man. And to mayntaine the trueth of this our sentence and
conclusion, and for moste certaine and vndoubted defence of thesame,
we al of one mynde and accorde shal at tall tymes and in euery place be
redy. In witnes wherof we haue made this writyng &amp; haue authorised
it with the accustomed seale of our Uniuersitie and also of our College
of diuines, Dated at Padway in the Churche of the Hermites of saint
Austen the fyrst day of Iuly, in the yere of our Lord M.D.xxx.
               
               
                  
                  The Determinacion of the Vniuersitie of Tholose.
                  There was treated in our vniuersitie of Tholose a very harde question:
Whether it be lefull for the brother to marye her which had ben
wyfe to his brother now departed, and that without chyldren? There
was besyde this another thyng that troubled vs very sore: Whether,
if the pope which hath the cure of Christes flocke would by his dispensacion
(as men call it) suffre this, that then at the least wyse it might be
lawfull? The Rector of the Uniuersitie called to counsell all the doctors
regētes that were that tyme at Tholose for to shew their myndes
on this question, &amp; that not once, but twyse: For he iudged that counsell
geuyng ought not to be hasted nor doone vpon head, &amp; that we had
neede of tyme and space to doo anye thynge conueniently &amp; as it ought
to bee. At the last there came togither into one place all the best learned
and connyngest doctors, both of holye diuinitie, and also doctors that
were best learned in bothe lawes, yea, and finally as many as had any
experiēce in any matter &amp; were able to do any thing either by iudgemēt
&amp; discresion, or by eloquence or their excellent wyttes. And there dyd
swere that they woulde obey the sacre &amp; holy counsels, &amp; woulde follow
the Decrees of the Fathers, which no man that hath any good conscience
wyll violate or breake. And so euery man sayde his mynde, and the
matter was debated and reasoned diffusely &amp; at large for bothe partes.
In conclusion, we fel so fast to this poynte, that this was the sentence &amp;
determinacion that oure Uniuersitie, with one voyce of all, dyd determine
and conclude with most pure and cleare conscience and defiled
with no maner of leuen or corrupcion: That it is lawful for no man,
neither by the law of God, nor by the law of nature, to take her to wyfe
that his brother hath lefte: And seeyng that it may not be doone by the
law of God nor of nature, we answered all: That the Pope can lose
no man frō that lawe nor dispence with him. And as for that thing can
not be contrary to our sentence &amp; verdyct: that the brother in olde tyme
was compelled by the law of Deuteronomy to mary the brothes wyfe
departed without issue: For this law was but a shadow and a fygure
of thinges to come, which vanyshed away assone as euer the lyght and
trueth of the Gospell appeared: And bicause these thynges be thus,
we haue geuen our sentence after this forme aboue, and haue cōmaunded
the same to be sygned by our Notary which is our secretory, and to
be fortified and aucthorised by the puttyng to of our autenticall Seale
of our Uniuersitie aforesayde, at Tholose the Calendes or fyrst day of
Octobre, the yere of our Lorde a thousande .v.C.xxx.
                  After these Determinacions were read, there were shewed aboue an
hundreth bookes drawen by Doctors of straunge Regions, which all
agreed the Kynges Mariage to be vnlefull, whiche were not read, for
the day was spent. Then the Chauncellor sayd: Now you of this commen
house may reporte in your countreys what you haue seene &amp; heard
and then al men shall openly perceyue that the Kyng hath not attempted

this matter of wyll or pleasure, as some straūgers reporte, but only
for the discharge of his cōscience &amp; suretie of the successiō of his realme:
This is the cause of our repayre hyther to you, &amp; now we wyl departe.
                  When these Determinacions were publysshed, all wyse men in the
Realme moche abhorred that mariage: but women, &amp; such as wer more
wylfull then wyse or learned, spake agaynst the Determinacion, &amp; sayd
that the Uniuersities were corrupte &amp; entysed so to doo, which is not to
be thought. The Kyng him selfe sore lamented his chaunce &amp; made no
maner o
                        •
                      myrth nor pastyme as he was wont to do, &amp; dyned &amp; resorted
to the quene as he was accustomed, &amp; minished nothyng of her estate,
and moch loued &amp; cheryshed their doughter the Lady Mary: but in no
wyse he woulde not come to her bed. When Ester began to draw nere,
the Parliament for that tyme ended, and was proroged till the last day
of Marche, in the nexte yere.
                  In the Parliament aforesayde was an Acte made,The Acte of Po
                           ••
                        onyng. that whosoeuer
dyd poyson any persone, shoulde be boyled in hote water to the death:
whiche Acte was made bicause one Richard Roose, in the Parliament
tyme had poysoned dyuers persons at the Bisshop of Rochesters place,
whiche Richard, according to the same Acte, was boyled in Smythfelde
the Teneber wednis
                        •
                     ay followyng, to the terrible example of all other.
                  This wynter season, on the .xxvi. day of Ianyuer, in the citie of Luxborne
in Portingale, was a wonderous Earthquake,
                        
                           〈◊〉
                         erthquake which destroied
many houses and towers, and slew many people by fallynge downe of
the same, the Kynges Palace shoke so, that he and the Quene, and the
Ladyes fled out of their Palace, without any seruauntes, and sought
succour where they myght get it, &amp; sodeinly the quakyng seassed: Then
the Rockes opened, and out sprange the water, that the shippes in the
hauen were lyke to haue peryshed: Then the earth quaked agayne, and
dyd more harme then before, and at nyght it ceassed: of whiche Earthquake,
many men were murthered and distroyed.
                  When the vniuersitie aforesayd, &amp; a great nombre of clerkes &amp; well
learned men had determined the Kynges mariage to be vnlawfull, detestable,
&amp; agaynst Gods lawe, as you haue heard, the Kyng willyng
the Quene to haue knowledge of the same, sent to her dyuers Lordes of
the coūcel the last dai of Maie beyng the wednisday in Whitson weke:
the whiche Lordes,
                        
                           〈…〉
                        
                      in her chaumbre at Grenewyche, declared to her all
the Determinacion as you haue hearde, &amp; asked her whether she would
for the quyetnesse of the Kynges conscience, put the matter to .iiii. Prelates,
&amp; .iiii. temporall Lordes of this Realme, or abyde by her appele.
The Quene answered: The Kyng my father which concluded my mariage,
I am sure, was not so ignoraunt but he asked conncell of clerkes
&amp; well learned men before he maryed me the second tyme: for if he had
had any doubte in my maryage, he woulde not haue disbursed so great
a treasure as he dyd, &amp; then all Doctors in maner agreed my maryage
to be good, insomoche that the Pope hym selfe, which knew best what

was to be dooen, dyd both dispence and ratified my seconde mariage,
agaynst whose doynge I meruayle that any persone wyll speake or
wryte: And as to the Determinacion of the vniuersitie, I am a womā
and lacke wytte and learnyng to aunswere to them, but to God I commit
the iudgemēt of that, whether thei haue done iustly or percially: for
this I am sure, that neither the Kynges father, nor my father woulde
haue condiscended to our Mariage if it had ben declared to be vnlawfull:
and where you say that I shoulde put the cause to .viii. persones
of this Realme for quyetnes of the Kynges conscience, I praye God
sende his grace a quyet conscience, and this shalbe your answere: That
I say I am his lawfull wyfe, and to hym lawfully maryed, and by the
ordre of holye Churche I was to hym espowsed as his trew wyfe, although
I was not so worthy, and in that poynte I wyll abyde tyll the
cowrte of Rome which was preuy to the begynnyng haue made therof
a determinacion and finall endyng. With this answere the Lordes departed
to the Kyng, whiche was sorye to heare of her wylfull opinion,
and in especiall that she more trusted in the Popes law then in keping
the Preceptes of God.
                  The Kyng lyke a politicke Prince, perceyued that the Merchaunt
straungers, and in especiall, Italians, Spanyardes &amp; Portyngales
daily brought Oade, Oyle, Sylke, Clothes of Golde, Ueluet, &amp; other
Merchaūdyse into this Realme, and therfore receyued ready money,
which money they euer deliuered to other merchauntes by exchaunge,
&amp; neuer employed the same money on the cōmodities of this Realme,
so that therby the Kyng was hyndered in his Custome outwarde, and
also the commodities of his Realme were not vttered, to the greate
hynderaunce of his subiectes: wherefore he caused a Proclamacion
to bee made in Mydsomer Tearme,A Proclamacion of Exchaunge. accordynge to an olde Estatute
made in the tyme of Kyng Rycharde the seconde: That no persone
should make any exchaunge contrary to the trew meanyng of the same
Acte and Estatute, vpon payne to be taken the kynges mortall enemy,
and to forfayte all that he myght forfayte. After this Proclamacion,
many clothes and other commodities of this Realme were well solde,
but shortly after Merchauntes fell to exchaunge agayne, and the Proclamacion
was shortly forgotten.
                  The Kyng after Whytsontyde and the Quene remoued to Wyndsore,
and there continued tyll the .xiiii. daye of Iulye, on whiche daye
the Kyng remoued to Woodstocke and lefte her at Wyndsore, where
she laye a whyle, and after remoued to the Moore, and afterwarde to
Estamstede: and after this day, the Kyng and she neuer saw together.
Wherfore the Commen people dailye murmured and spake their folysh
fantasies. But the affayres of Princes be not ordered by the commen
people, nor it were not conuenient that all thynges were opened
to theim.
                  After this, the Kyng sent certayne Lordes to the Queene to Estamstede

to aduyse her to be confirmable to the lawe of God, and to shewe
vnto her, that all the Uniuersities had clearely determined, that the
Pope coulde in no wyse dispence with her Mariage, and therefore the
Dispensacion to which she most trusted of all, was clearely voyde and
of none effecte. These, with manye mo causes and aduysementes were
declared to her, whiche nothynge moued her at all, but styll she sayde:
Truly I am the Kynges trew wyfe, and to hym maryed: and if all Doctors
were dead, or law, or learnyng so farre out of mannes mynde at
that tyme of our maryage, yet I can not thinke that the courte of Rome
and the whole Churche of Englande woulde consent to a thing vnlawfull
and detestable (as you call it) but styll I say I am his wyfe, and
for him wyl I pray. With this answer the Lordes departed, and came
to the Kyng and made reporte as you haue hearde.
                  This mariage was not alonly talked of in England▪ but in Fraunce
Spayne▪ Italy, yea, thorough all Christendome in maner, and especially
in themperourrs Courte, insomoche as a great Marques of
Spayne sayde to syr Nicholas Heruy knyght beyng the Kynges Ambassader
in themperours Cowrte at Gaunte: My Lorde Ambassador
of Englande, I meruayle not a lytell why the Kyng your Master dalyeth
so with themperours Aunte, she is dissended I assure you of a noble
bloode and hye Parentage, themperours Maiestie may not nor wyl
not suffre so
                        •
                     he iniurye to be doone to his bloode and lynage, that she
shoulde whole .xxii. yeres and more serue him as his wyfe and bedfelow
and now to reiecte her, what Princely maner is that▪ therein is neither
loue nor loyaltie? For if a poore verlet had so long serued a Prince,
what herte coulde haue then reiected hym or put hym from hym? it can
not be sayd that your Kyng is well councelled: the matter is moch meruayled
at amongest Christen Princes &amp; thynke her not to be honestly
handeled nor honorably: And if it be so that she be not hys wyfe (bicause
she was once his brothers wyfe) as your Doctors say &amp; affirme,
then no man can excuse your Kyng nor saye bnt that she hath ben euyll
handeled, and kepte lyke a Concubine or Paramour for the bodely appetite,
which is a great spotte, shame, &amp; rebuke to her and to her whole
lynage, which spot no wayes can be sponged out nor recompenced, for
shame in a kynred can by no treasure be redemed: If he Kyng your
Maister remembre well this matter, he shall fynde that it transcendeth
farre aboue the losse of erthly possessyons, I woulde he woulde be better
aduysed.
                  The Englysh Ambassador answered:An Answere. My Lorde, my cōmission extēdeth
not to answer this matter, but to enforme you of the truth, I wyl
somewhat say besyde my commission: Fyrst I say to you, that the kyng
my maister neuer ment in this matter but honorably, truly, and vertuously
bothe for the pleasure of God and the profyte and surety of his
Realme, nor neuer was nor shall be anye Prince that euer was better
contented and pleased with a woman then he hath ben with her, nor neuer

Prince more loued, cherished, nor honoured a woman, then the king
my Maister hath dooen her, &amp; woulde with herte, mynde, and wyll her
styll keepe as his wyfe, if Goddes lawe woulde suffre it: My Lorde,
if you remembre well all thyng, you shall fynde that this doubt was
fyrst moued in the Councell of Spayne, when the Emperour and the
Kyng of Englande were agreed, that themperoure shoulde marye the
Ladye Marye the Kynges Doughter: Upon that communicacion
this doubte was put to themperours Councell, whether she were the
Kynges lawfull Doughter or not, because it was well knowen that he
had maryed his brothers wyfe.
                  This matter was not so secrete but it spred into the councell bothe
of Fraunce and Flaunders, to the great defamacion of the Kyng of
Englande, &amp; to the great vncertaintye of the successyon of his Realme:
whereof when he was aduertysed, I thynke neuer Prince tooke it
more sorrowfully nor more dolently, and for satisfiynge of his conscience,
he called his Cleargye and felte their opinions, and not trustyng
his owne subiectes onely (which I ensure you be excellently lerned)
sent to all the Uniuersities of Fraunce, Italye, and dyuers other
Realmes to know their iudgementes in this case, and surely the Kyng
my master sore lamenteth his chaunce and bewaileth the tyme myspent
if it so 
                        •
                     uccede, for then is his Realme destitute of a lawfull heyre begotten
of his body, whiche is the greatest displeasure that maye come
to a Prince: The Mariage was well ment bothe of the kynges father
and the Quenes father, and they maryed together by the aduyce and
councell of their frendes, and so louyngly continued together as man
and wyfe without any scruple or doubte, tyll you of Spayne moued
fyrst the question and put the maryage in ambiguitie, and therfore you
can not with honour thynke but that the Kyng hath doone lyke a wyse
Prince to searche out the solucion of your doubte which so neare toucheth
his soule and the suretye of his Realme: And all thynge that he
hath done he hath done by great aduysement and with a great deliberacion,
wherefore no reasonable man can saye but he hath done lyke a
wyse and vertuous Prince. The Marques hearynge this aunswere
sayde, that the Kyng dyd wysely to trye the truthe, and was somewhat
ashamed of that that he had spoken, as I was infourmed by them that
were present.
                  You haue hearde before howe the Cleargye in their Conuocacion
had graunted to the Kyng the sōme of one hundreth thousa
                        •
                     d pounde
to be pardoned of the Premunire: for leuiyng of the whyche summe, euery
Bysshop in his Dioces called before hym all the Priestes as well
chauntrie and parysh priestes as Persones and Uycars, amongest
whom, Doctor Ihon Stokesley Bysshop of London, a man of great
wytte and learnyng, but of lytle discresion and humanitie (which caused
hym to be out of the fauoure of the common people) called before
hym all the Preistes within the Citie of London, whether they were

Curates or Stipendaries, the first day of Septembre beyng fridaye,
in the Chapiter House of Saynt Paull, at whyche daye the Priestes
appeared, and the Bysshoppes policye was to haue onely syxe or eight
priestes together, and by persuacions to haue caused them to graunte
some porsion towarde the payment of the foresayde One Hundreth .M.
pounde, but the nombre of the Priestes was so great, for they were
syxe hundreth at the least, &amp; with them came many Temporall men to
heare of the matter, that the Bysshoppe was disapoynted of his purpose:
for when the Bysshoppes Officers called in certayne Priestes
by name into the Chapiter house: with that, a great nombre entered,
for they putte the Bysshppes Officers that kepte the dore a syde.
A
                        •
                     ter this the officers got the dore shut agayne: then the priestes without
sayde: We wyll not be kepte without, &amp; our fellowes be within: we
knowe not what the Bysshoppe wyll doo with them. The Temporall
men beyng present stomaked and conforted the priestes to enter, so that
by force they opened the dore, and one strake the Bysshoppes Officer
ouer the face and entered the Chapiter house and many temporall men
with them, and long it was or any sylence coulde be made: and at last
when they were appea
                        •
                     ed the Bysshop stoode vp and sayde: Brethern,
I meruayle not a lytell why you be so heddy and know not what shall
be sayde to you,The bishopes saiyng therefore I pray you to keepe sylence and to heare me
paciently: My frendes all, you knowe well that wee bee men frayle of
condicion and no Angels, and by frayltie and lacke of wysedome wee
haue misdemeaned our selfe toward the Kyng our Soueraygne Lorde
and his lawes, so that all wee of the Clearge were in the Premunire,
by reason wherof, all our Promocions, Landes, Goodes and Catelles
were to hym forfayte and our bodyes 
                        •
                     eadye to be enprisoned, yet his
grace moued with pittie and compassyon, demaunded of vs what wee
coulde say why he shoulde not extende his lawes vpon vs, then the fathers
of the Cleargye humbly besought his grace of mercye, to whom
he answered that he was euer enclyned to mercy: then for all our great
offences we had lytell penaunce for where he might by the rygor of his
law haue taken al our lyuelod, goodes &amp; catels, he was contented with
one hundreth thousand poundes to be payde in fyue yeres: &amp; although
that this sōme be more then we maye easelye beare, yet by the rygor of
his lawes we shoulde haue borne the whole burdeyne: Wheerfore my
brethren, I charitably exhorte you to beare your partes of your liuelod
and salary towarde the payment of this sōme graunted. Then it was
shortely sayde to the Bysshoppe: My Lorde, twentye nobles a yere is
but a ba
                        •
                     e lyuynge for a priest, for nowe victayle and euery thynge in
maner is so deare, that pouertie in maner enforceth vs to saye naye:
besyde that, my Lorde we neuer offended in the Premunire, for we medeled
neuer with the Cardinals faculties, let the Bysshoppes and Abbottes
whych haue offended paye. Then the Bysshoppes officers gaue
to the priestes hyghe woordes, whyche caused them to be the more obs
                        ••
                     nate.
Also dyuers temporall men whych were present conforted the

Priestes and bade theim agree to no payment. In this rumor, dyuers
of the Bysshoppes seruauntes were buffyted and stryken so that the
Bysshop beganne to be a frayde, and with fayre woordes appeased the
noyse, and for all thynges whiche were done or sayde there he pardoned
them and gaue to them his blessyng and praied them to departe in charitie.
And then they departed thynkyng to heare no more of the matter,
but they were disceyued, for the Bysshop went to syr Thomas Moore
then beyng Lorde Chauncellor (whiche greatly fauoured the Bysshop
and the Cleargye) and to hym made a greuouse complaynte and declared
the facte very greuously, wherevpon commaundement was sent to
syr Thomas Pargitor Mayer of the Citie, to attache certayne priestes
and temporall men, and so .xv. priestes and .v. temporall men were arrested,
of the whych, some were sent to the Tower, some to the Fleete,
and other Prisons, where they remayned long after.
                  In this season were dyuers Preachynges in the Realme, one contrarye
to another concernyng the Kynges Maryage, and in especiall
one Thomas Ab
                        •
                     ll clerke, bothe preached and wrote a Booke, that the
Mariage was lawfull, whiche caused many symple men to beleue his
opinion: This Abell was the Queenes Chaplayne, and wrote this
Booke to please her withall: wherfore the Kyng caused a Determinaciō
of the Uniuersities, &amp; all the iudgementz of gret Clerkes to be compyled
into a Booke and to be Printed, whiche Booke dyd satisfie the
myndes of all indifferent &amp; discrete persons: but some men were perciall
that neither learnyng nor reason could satisfy their wylfull myndes.
                  This yere the Kyng kepte his Christemas at Grenewyche with
great solempnitie, but all men sayde that there was no myrthe in that
Christemas because the Queene and the Ladies were absent.
                  After Christemas the .xv. daye of Ianuary the Parliament began
to sytte, &amp; amongest dyuers griefes whych the Commons were greued
with, they sore cōplayned of the crueltie of the Ordinarirs, for callyng
men before theym Ex officio: that is, by reason of ther office: For the
Ordinaries woulde sende for men and ley Accusacions to them of Heresye,
and say they were accused, and ley Articles to them, but no Accuser
should be brought furth, whiche to the Commons was very dredeful
and greuous: for the partie so Assited must either Abiure or be burned,
for Purgacion he myght make none.
                  When this matter and other Exactions done by the Clergy in their
Courtes were long debated in the Common House, at the last it was
concluded &amp; agreed, that all the griefes which the temporall men were
greued with, shoulde be putte in writyng and delyuered to the Kyng,
whiche by great aduyce was done: wherfore, the .xviii. day of Marche
the Common speaker accompanyed with dyuers Knyghtes and Burgesses
of the Common House came to the Kynges presence, and there
declared to hym how the temporall men of his Realme were sore agreued
with the cruell demeanoure of the Prelattes and Ordinaryes,

                  When the Kyng had receyued the Supplicacion of the Commons,
he paused a whyle and then sayde: It is not the offyce of a Kyng which
is a Iudge to be to lyghte of credence,The Kynges saiyng. nor I haue not, nor wyll not

you must tary the tyme, orels to be without remedy: I moche commend
you that you wyll not contende nor stand in stryfe with the Spirituall
men, whiche be youre Christen brethren, but moche more me thynketh
that you shoulde not contende with me that am youre Souereygne
Lorde and Kyng, consideryng that I seke peace and quyetnesse of you:
For I haue sent to you a byll concernynge wardes and primer season,
in the which thynges I am greatly wronged: wherfore I haue offered
you reason as I thy
                        •
                     ke, yea, and so thynketh all the Lordes, for they

                     e you so moche agayne:
with this answere, the Speaker and his company departed.
The cause why the Kyng spake these woordes was this: Daily men
made Feoffementes of their landes to their vses, and declared their
wylles of their landes with soch remaynders, that not alonly the kyng
but all other Lordes lost their Wardes, Mariages and relieffes, and
the kyng also lost his primer season, &amp; the profyte of the lyuerey, which
was to hym very prediudiciall and a great losse: wherfore he, lyke an
indifferent Prince, not willyng to take all, nor to lose all, caused a byll
to be drawen by his learned councell, in the which was deuysed, that euerye
man myght make his wyll of the halfe of his lande, so that he
lefte the other halfe to the heyre by discent. When this Byil

came fyrst amonges the Commons, lorde how the ignoraunt persones
were greued, and howe shamefully they spake of the byll and of the
Kynges learned Councell: but the wyse men which vnderstoode &amp; sawe
the myschiefe to come, woulde gladly haue had the byll to be assented
to, or at the least to haue put the Kyng in a suretye of the thyrde or
fourthe parte, whiche offer I was credebly informed the Kyng woulde
haue taken: but many frowarde and wylfull persones, not regardyng
what myght ensue (as it dyd in deede) woulde neither consent to the
byll as the Lordes had agreed and set to their handes, nor yet agree to
no reasonable qualificacion of the same, whiche they sore repented:
For after this, the Kyng called the Iudges and best learned men of his
Realme, and thei disputed this matter in the Chaūcery, and agreed that
lande coulde not be wylled by the ordre of the common law: wherupon
an Acte was made, that no man myght declare his wyll of no parte of
his lande: which Acte sore greued the Lordes and Gentlemen that had
many chyldren to setfurth. Therefore you may iudge what myschiefe
cōmeth of wylfull blyndnesse and lacke of foresyght in so great causes.
                  This Parliament was proroged tyll the tenth day of Apryll, in the
whiche Parliament was an Acte made, that Bysshops shoulde pay no
more Annates or money for their Bulles to the Pope: for it was openly
proued that there was payed for the Bulles of Bysshoppes, in the
fourthe yere of Kyng Henry the seuenth, the Kynges father, tyll this
yere, one hundreth thre score thousand pounde sterlyng, besyde all other
Dispensacions and Pardones, wherof the summe was incredible.
                  When the Parliament was begonne agayne after Ester, there came
downe to the Common house the Lorde Chauncelloure, the Dukes of
Norffolke &amp; Suffolke, the Erles of Arundell, Oxforde, Northumbrelande,
Rutlande, Wylshyre and Sussex, and after they were set, the
Lorde Chauncellor declared, howe the Kyng was aduertised by his
Councell, and in especiall by the Duke of Norffolke, howe on the
Marches betwene Englande and Scotlande was very lytell habitacion,
on the Englysh syde, but on the Scottysh syde was great habitacion,
and the Scottes dwelled euen iust on the border, by the reason
wherof they inuaded England dyuets tymes, and dyd to the Kynges
subiectes great hurte and displeasure: wherefore the Kyng entended
to make dwellyng houses there, and also to make new diuers Pyles
and stoppes to let the Scottysh men from their inuasions, to the great
commoditie of all his people there dwellyng, which thynges coulde
not be doone without great cost: Wherefore consideryng the Kynges
good entente, he sayde, that the Lordes thoughte it conueniente to
graunte to the Kyng some reasonable ayde toward his charges, and
prayed the Cōmons to consulte on the same, and then he and all the
Lordes departed.
                  After their departure, the cōmons cōsidering the kinges good entent,
louingly graūted to him a .xv. toward his charges, but this graūt was

not enacted at this Sessyon, bicause that sodeinly began a Pestilence
in Westmynster, wherefore the Parlyament was proroged tyll the
nexte yere.
                  In this yere was an olde Tolle demaunded in Flaunders of Englysh
men, called the Tolle of the Hounde, which is a Ryuer and a passage:
The Tolle is .xii. pence of a Fardell. This Tolle had ben often
tymes demaunded, but neuer payed: insomoche that Kyng Henry the
seuenth, for the demaunde of that Tolle, prohibited all his subiectes
to kepe any Marte al Antwerpe or Barow, but caused the Martes to
be kepte at Calyes: at which tyme it was agreed that the sayde Tolle
shoulde neuer be demaunded, so that the Englysh men woulde resorte
agayne into the Dukes countrey, and after that, it was not demaunded
tyll now: Wherefore the Kyng sent Doctor Knyght and other to Calyes,
and thyther came themperours Commissioners, and the matter
was put in suspence for a tyme.
                  Ye haue hearde before how the Kyng had purchased the Bysshop of
Yorkes place, whiche was a fayre By
                        •
                     shops house, but not meete for
a Kyng: wherefore the Kyng purchased all the medowes about saynt
Iames, and all the whole house of s. Iames, and there made a fayre
mansion and a parke, &amp; buylded many costly and commodious houses
for great pleasure.
                  Now must I declare to you a noble enterprise, although it were not
doone in England, yet bicause diuers Englysh men were at that auenture,
I wyll declare it as the Lorde Master of the Religion of Saynt
Ihons wrote to the Lorde of saynt Ihons in Englande: The Lorde
Mas
                        •
                     er of the Religion, lamentyng sore the losse of the Rodes, whiche
he thought not sone to be recouered, consydered that the Turke helde
the towne of Modon whiche standeth on the See syde, and is a fayre
Porte, and woul
                        •
                     e haue gladlye had that towne oute of the Turkes
possession▪ called to hym a trusty seruaunt of his, called Caloram, which
was well langaged, and to hym declared, that he woulde haue hym to
sayle to Modon, and to dwell there as a Turke vnknowen, and if he
myght by any meanes to come into seruice with Massie de Huga, which
was Capitayne there. Caloram answered, that to go thyther for the
accomplyshyng of the Lord masters desyre, he was very well content,
but to come in seruyce and fauoure with the Capitayne, must come in
processe of tyme and by continuance, and that not without great expence:
The Lorde Maister promysed hym sufficient treasure and a
great rewarde: When Caloram was perfectly enstructed in all thyng
he toke his leaue and came priuely to Modon, &amp; there dwelled, &amp; within
shorte space he was the Capitayns seruaunt, &amp; for his great diligence
was with his master in great fauoure. Then he wrote to the Lorde
Miaster all thyng, and asserrayned hym that his entent coulde not
take effecte hastely, but bade hym euer be readye. Thys matter
thus contynued two yeare, in whiche tyme Caloram well perceyned

howe the towne myght be taken, and therefore wrote to the Lord Master,
which shortly came to a place called Mucollutea. The Turkes
haue a condicion in August &amp; Septembre, to resorte into the countrey
to see the fruytes, and to solace theim selfe, wherfore the Lorde Master
appoynted the Prior of Rome and the Tur
                        •
                     uplya
                        •
                      of England to be
Capitaynes of this enterprise, and with them were .lx. knightes of the
Religion, and .vii.C. and fyftye souldyers in .vi. Galyes &amp; Brigantes,
and passed the Cape Blanke in the lande of Calaber, the .xviii. day of
August, and there they ankered: and from, that place they myght sayle
lx. myle to Modon, vnder the hylles of Stroffadees. And in the waye
they stopped all the shippes that passed toward Modon: &amp; from thence
they sent woorde to Caloram, which sent them woorde, not to be to hastye:
for the Uenicians had reported in Modon, that the Galyes of the
Religion were on the see: and also a Capitayne of the Turkes, called
Frombylam was come to Modon with .ii.C. horsemē to vew the towne
so that Caloram was in great feare of his enterprice. But the same
nyght there came to Modon a Gripe or small vessell, in the which were
thre knyghtes of the Religion all in marynors arrey, and there sought
for fresh water and other victails necessary, which knightes spake with
Calora
                        •
                     , and the same day the Capitayne Frombylam departed from
Modon. Then Caloram sent worde to the Capitaynes, that he trusted
that their iourney shoulde be well sped: which knyghtes departed and
came to the Capitaynes, whiche wysely assembled all their people at a
Roade called Stroffades, and there declared their commission of their
Lorde Master, and also shewed Calorams letters, whereof euery man
was greatly comforted to know what enterprise they went about. Then
it was appoynted that the Prior of Rome shoulde fyrst entre and take
the gate of the principall tower, and the Turkeiplier with .vi. English
knyghtes were appoynted to defende the Molle or Peere at the hauen
mouthe: and to euery gate was a Capitayn appoynted with a nombre
for the gates of the towne and the Fortresses were well knowen to the
Religion of .s. Ihon Baptist. When all this ordre was appoynted, the
Galies disancored &amp; came to the Ile of Sapience .iii. myle from Modon.
All this whyle Caloram was in great 
                        •
                     eare tyll the two Capiteins
sent a vessell called a Gripe, &amp; in her, iii.C. men: Thei were no so ner entered
the peere, but the Turkes came a borde &amp; asked for the merchaūtz
(for all the men wer appearlled lyke Mariners) they answered that the
Merchauntes which had the charge were gone a land into the towne, &amp;
sayde they would bring them to the Merchauntes, &amp; that all their merchaūdise
was good wodde, which thyng the Turkes moch desyre: So
the christē knyghtes lyke mariners weut with the Turkes, which wer
to the nombre of .xiii. entendyng to begyn their enterprise, &amp; some went
towarde the tower, and some went toward the gate followyng the .xii.
Turkes, &amp; after them issued all the souldiers out of the Gripe,Modon tak
                           •
                        . &amp; so with
force thei got the gate, &amp; after that ye molle or pyre, &amp; on that set a bāner

of the Religion to the which Caloram helped moch: with that came all
the Galyes and landed. Then begāne a terrible slaughter of al partes,
the Turkes fled, and the Christen men followed, and the Capitaynes
tooke the walles: and from thence Caloram lead them to the house of
Messyre Huga, in whiche house was a great strength: For his house
was lyke a Fortresse or tower, whiche ioyned to the walle of the towne,
out of which was a Posterne, wherof issued out certayn Turkes which
askryed the Christen men abrode in the countrey. But in the meane season
the Christen men assauted the sayde Fortresse, whiche was sore defended:
and there the Prior of Rome was by a hackbush slayn, whiche
chaunce made the Christen men more furious, &amp; slew in the towne .iii.C
Turkes and aboue. Then they blew to retreite, and councelled together
&amp; well perceyued that they coulde not keepe the towne excepte they had
the fortresse or tower, which they coulde not obtayne without a Siege,
and then they had no ordinaunce nor people ynough, therfore they determined
to take their most aduauntage by pyllage, and so spoyled the
towne &amp; tooke .viii.C. prisoners &amp; sent them to the Galyes. And when
the Turkes saw the Cristen men styll pulfer (as the vsage of souldiers
is) they issued out of their holde &amp; fortresse and fought with the Christē
men boldely in the stretes, so that the stretes ranne bloode in the canels,
the fyghte was sore: and euer the Turkes came in at the posterne by
askry, and assauted the Christen men, which valiauntly defended them
and for all the Turkes power came to their Galies with their pray and
prisoners, and came to the Ile of Malto with all their booty, not leesyng
.xl. persones in all their iourney: wherof the Lorde Master was
moche reioyed &amp; well rewarded Caleram, whiche also came with them
to Malto. This enterprise was dooen on a sonday, beynge the .xviii.
day of August, the yere of our Lorde a thousand, fyue hundreth, thyrtie
and one, and this .xxiii. yere of his Reigne.
                  After this enterprise, the .xxii. day of Septembre, dyed Lady Loyse
Dutchesse of Angulesme and mother to the Frenche Kyng, a wyse and
a sad Lady: whereof the Kyng beynge aduertised, caused a solempne
Obsequye to be made and kepte for her in the Abbey of Waltham in
Essex, at the whiche solempnitie, the Kynge and a great nombre of the
Nobles and Prelates of the Realme wer present in mournyng apparell
at the Kynges coste and charge.
               
            
            
               ¶The .xxiiii. yere.
               
                  IN the beginnyng of this, xxiiii. yere, the Lady Anne Bulleyne
was so moche in the Kynges fauour, that the commen
people which knew not the Kynges trew entent, sayd
and thought that the absence of the Quene was onely for
her sake, which was not trew: for the king was openly rebuked
of Preachers for keping company with his brothers wife, which
was thoccasyon that he eschued her companye, tyll the truth wer tryed.
               
                  The last daie of Aprill the parliamēt sittyng, the kyng sent for Thomas
Awdeley, Spekar of the common house, and certain other, and dec
                     •
                  ared
to thē, how thei had exhibited a boke of their greues, the last yere
against the Spiritualtie, whiche at their requestes, he had deliuered to
his spirituall subiectes, to make answere there to, but he could haue no
answere, till within three daies last past, whiche answere he deliuered to
the Spekar, saiyng: we thynke their answere will smally please you, for
it semeth to vs very slender, you bee a greate sorte of wisemen, I doubt
not but you will loke circumspectly on the matter, and we will be indifferent
betwene you. And for a truth their answere was very Sophisticall,
and nothyng auoydyng the greues of the laye people: and farther
the kyng saied, that he marueiled not a litle, why one of the Parliament
house spake openly, of the absence of the Quene frō hym, whiche matter
was not to be determined there, for he saied it touched his soule, and wisshed
the matrimony to be good, for then had he neuer been vexed in cōscience,
but the docters of the vniuersities said he, haue determined the mariage
to bee voyde, and detestable before God, whiche grudge of conscience,
caused me to abstein from her compaignie, and no folishe or wanton
appetite: for I am said he .xli. yere old, at whiche age the lust of man
is not 
                     •
                  o quicke, as in lustie youth: and sauyng in Spain and Portyngall
it hath not been seen, that one man hath maried two sisters, the one
beyng carnally knowē before: but the brother to mary the brothers wife
was so abhorred emongest all nacions, that I neuer heard it, that any
Christen man did it, but my self: wherfore you se my conscience troubled
and so I praie you reporte: so the Spekar departed, and declared to the
commons the kynges saiyng, bothe of the Spirituall mennes answere,
and also concernyng the kynges mariage, whiche sight answere displesed
the commons.
               The occasion why the Kyng spake of his marige, was because one
Temse in the common house, moued the commons to sue to the kyng, to
take the Quene again into his compaignie, and declared certain greate
mischiefes, as in bastardyng the Lady Marie, the kynges onely childe,
and diuerse other inconueniences, whiche woordes were reported to the
kyng, whiche was the cause that he declared his conscience.
               The .xi. daie of Maie, the kyng sent for the Speker again, and .xii. of
the common house, hauyng with hym eight Lordes, and saied to theim,
welbeloued subiectes, we thought that ye clergie of our realme, had been
our subiectes wholy, but now wee haue well perceiued, that thei bee but
halfe our subiectes, yea, and scace our subiectes: for all the Prelates at
their consecracion, make an othe to the Pope, clene contrary to the othe
that thei make to vs, so that thei seme to be his subiectes, and not ours,
the copie of bothe the othes, I deliuer here to you, requiryng you to inuent
some ordre, that we bee not thus deluded, of our Spirituall subiectes.
The Spekar departed, and caused the othes to bee redde in the cō
                  mon
house, the very tenor whereof ensueth.

               The openyng of these othes, was one of the occasions, why the Pope

within two yere folowyng, lost all his inrisdiccion in Englande, as you
shall here afterward. The .xiiii. daie ye parliament was proroged, til the
iiii. daie of February next ensuyng. After whiche prorogacion, sir Thomas

               The kyng beyng in progresse this Sommer, was aduertised that the
Pope and the Frenche Kyng, had appoynted to mete at Marcelles in
Prouince, in the beginnyng of the nexte Spryng▪ wherefore the kyng
like a wise and pollitike prince, thought it conuenient to speake with the
Frenche kyng in his awne persone, before the Pope and he should come
together, and to declare to hym bothe the determinacion, of the Uniuersities
and Doctors concernyng his Matrimonie, and also the generall
coūsailes, whiche ordeined suche causes, to be tried in the poruinces and
countreis, where the doubt should rise, trustyng that the Frenche kyng
should cause the Pope to encline to Goddes law, and to leaue his awne
tradicions, and voyde dispensacions, whereupon bothe the princes concluded,
to mete in October folowyng, betwene Calic

and seruauntes, commaundyng theim to bee ready at Cantorbury, the
xxvi daie of September, to passe the Seas with hym, for the accomplishyng
of the enteruew, betwene hym and his brother the Frenche kyng.
Many men wer sory to here, that the kyng should passe the sea in Winter,
and specially in October, when the seas be rough, but their saiynges
letted not his purpose: for he marched forward from Ampthill to Wynsore,
where on Sundaie beyng the firste daie of September, he created
the lady Anne Bulleyn, Marchiones of Penbroke, and gaue to her one
thousande pound lande by the yere, and that solemnitie finished, he rode
to the College to Masse, and when the Masse was ended, a newe league
was concluded &amp; sworne,A new league betwene the kyng and the French kyng, Messire

Latin, in praise of peace, loue, and amitie: whiche dooen the trumpettes

               The .x. daie of October, the kyng came to Douer, and on the .xi. daie
in the mornyng beyng Fridaie, at three of the clocke he tooke shippyng
in Douer rode, and before .x. of the clocke thesame daie, he with the lady

Marchiones of Pembroke, landed at Caleis, where he was honorably
receiued with procession, and brought to sainct Nicholas church, where
he hard Masse, and so to his place called Thexchequer, where he lodged
And on the Sondaie after came to Caleis, the lorde Roche Baron, and
Monsire de Mountpesat, messengers frō the Frenchkyng, aduertisyng
the kyng of Englād, that the Frenche kyng would repaire to Abuile the
same night marchyng towarde Bull
                     •
                  yne, of whiche tidynges the kyng
was very glad: but sodainly came a messenger, &amp; reported that the great
Master of Fraunce, and the Archebishoppe of Roan, with diuerse noble
men of Fraunce, wer come to Sandifeld, entendyng to come to Caleis,
to salute the kyng, from the kyng their Master. He beyng therof aduertised,
sent in greate hast the .xv. daie of October, the Duke of Norffolke
the Marques of Excester, the Erles of Oxford, Darby, and Rutlande,
the lorde Sandes, and the lorde Fitzwater, with .iii.C. gentlemen, whiche
honorably receiued the Frenche lordes, at the Englishe pale, and so
brought thē to the kynges presence in Caleis, whiche stode vnder a ri

kyng (as he that knewe all honor and nurture) receiued the Frenche lordes,
very louyngly and amiably, and with thē toke a daie &amp; place of metyng:
these lordes wer highly feasted, &amp; after diner departed to Bullein.
               While the kyng lay thus in Caleis, he vewed the walles, towers, and
Bulwerkes, and deuised certain newe fortificaciōs, for the maintenance
and defence of the toune. The toune of Caleis had at this season .xxiiii.C.
beddes, and stablyng for .ii M. horses, beside the villages adiacent.

Dukes of Norffolke and Suffolke, and with the Marquesses of Dorcet
and Excester, the Erles of Arundell, Oxford, Surrey, Essex, Derby
Rutlande, Huntyngdon, and Sussex, and diuerse Uiscountes, Barons,
Knightes of the Garter, and Gentlemen, freshely appareled, and richly
trimmed, and so passed toward the place, appoynted for the enteruewe,
leuyng behinde thē the greatest part of ye yomen in Caleis, because that
Bulleyne was to litle for bothe the traines. For the Frenchemen saied
their train was xx. M. horse, whiche caused the Englishmen to cast many
perelles, and especially because it was bruted abrode, that the Frenche
kyng should saie, the Kyng of Englande was once his enemie, and
mainteined the Emp
                     •
                  ror and the duke of Burbō against hym, and now
he was become his moste frende. The rehersyng of these olde grudges
many Englishmen suspected, and very lothe that the kyng should go to
Bulleyne, but the kyng continued still in his iorney, and came to Sandyngfelde,
and a litle from that place in a valey, was the Frenche kyng
nobely accompaignied, with three hundred horse, and not muche more.
The Kynges tr

                  ight hande: like wise did the Frenche part, to geue the

Englishemen the right hande: so the twoo kynges with all louely honor
met with bare heddes, and embrased other in suche fashion, that all that
behelde them reioysed. The kyng of Englande was appareled,The Kynges apparell. in a cote
of greate riches, in braides of golde laied lose on Russer Ueluet, and set
with Traifoyles, full of pearle and stone. The Frenche Kyng was in a
coate of cr

                  mosin veluet, all to cut, lined with slender cloth of gold plucked
out through the cuttes. The noble men on bothe parties, wer richely
apparreled, and as was reported, the Frenche kyng saied openly, to the
kyng of Englande:The saiyng of the Frēche Kyng. sir you be thesame persone, that I am moste bounde
to in the worlde, and sithe it hath pleased you, in persone to visite me, I
am bound in persone to seke you, and for the very frendship, that I haue
found in you. I am yours and will be, and so I require you to take me,
and with that put of is bonet: the kyng of England soberly answered.
If euer I did thyng to your likyng I am glad, &amp; as touchyng the pain
to come hether to se you, I assure you it is my greate comforte, yea, and
I had come farther to haue visited you. Then the kynges embrased the
lordes and estates, as the Frenche kyng the lordes of England, and the
kyng of England, the lordes of Fraunce, and that doen, thei set forward
toward Bulleyne, and in ridyng thei cast of Haukes called Sakers to
the Kytes, whiche made to theim greate sporte. And in a valey beyonde
Sādyngfeld, the kyng of Nauerr met the kynges, and there thei a lighted
and dranke, and a

                  ter that thei mounted on horsebacke, &amp; with haukyng
and other princely pastyme, thei came nere to Bulleyn, where on a
hill stode ranged in a faire bande, the nomber of fiue hundred menne on
horsebacke, of whom the chief wer, the Frenche kynges three sonnes, the
Dolphin, the Duke of Orleaunce, and the Duke of Angulesme, and on
them gaue attendaunce, the Admirall of Fraūce, and three Cardinalles
with diuerse other nobles of Fraunce: these three Princes marched forwarde,
and welcomed the kyng of Englande, whiche theim well behelde
and louyngly them receiued, as he that could as muche nurture, as any
Prince that euer was. Then the Frenche kyng saied to his children opē
                  ly:
My children, I am your father, but to this Prince here you are as
muche bound, as to me your naturall father, for he redemed me and you
from captiuitie: wherfore on my blessyng I charge you, to be to hym louyng
alwaies. The kyng of Englande ceassed the Frenche kynges tale,
and embrased the young Princes, eche after other: all their three apparelles
were blacke Ueluet, embraudered with siluer of Damaske. Then
all these noble compaignie came to Bulleyne,The Kynges commyng to Bulleyn. where was a greate shot
of Artilery, for on the one side thei shot greate pellettes, whiche made a
greate noyse: then these twoo Princes offered at our Lady of Bulleyne,
and the Frenche kyng brought the kyng of Englande to his lodgyng,
in the Abbay directly against his awne lodging, where the kyng of Englande
had diuerse chambers, the vtter chamber was hanged with faire
Arras, and another chamber was hanged with grene Ueluet, embraudered
with Uinettes of gold, and fret with flowers of Siluer, and smal

twigges of wrethen worke, &amp; in the middle of euery pane, or pece, was a
fable of Ouid in Matamorphoseos embraudered, and a clothe of estate
of thesame worke, valanced with frettes, knotted and langettes tassaled
with Uenice golde and siluer: and in this chamber was hanged a great
braunche of siluer percell gilte, to beare lightes. Then was there an in

wer bothe in one suite: thesame night the Frēche kyng, made to the kyng
of Englande a supper in his chamber, whiche was hanged with Arras,

kyng, opē on euery side, sauyng it was siled with blew veluet, embraudered

clothe of gold, embraudered and gilted after the fashion that Mariners
cast their ropes: this trauerse was valensed of like woorke, and fringed
with fine gold. Daily the kynges heard their Masses in these trauerses
and commonly thei went together to Masse. Diuerse tymes the kynges
communed together in counsaill, and sometyme in the mornyng, or the
princes wer stirryng▪ their coūsailes met, and sat together agreat while.
               While the kyng of Englande, lay thus at Bulleyn, the Frenche kyng
to shewe hymself louyng to the noble men of Englande, the .xxv. daie of

October, called a Chapiter of the compaignions of his Ordre, called
Sainct Michell, of whom the kyng of Englande was one, and so there
elected Thomas Duke of Norffolke, and Charles Duke of Suffolke,
to bee compaignions of thesaied Ordre, whiche were brought into the
Chapiter, and had there Collers deliuered to theim, and were sworne to
the Statutes of the Ordre, their obeysaunce to their souereigne Lorde,
alwaies reserued: whiche Dukes thanked the Frenche Kyng, and gaue
to the Officers of Armes twoo hundred Crounes a pece. All this season
the Frenche kyng and his courte wer freshe, and his gard were appareled,
in frockes of blewe Crimosin, and yelowe veluet. With the Frenche
kyng, was the kyng of Nauerr, the Dolphin of Uien, the Dukes of Orliaunce,
Angulesme, Uandosine, Guyse, Longuile, the Erles of Sainct
Paule, Neuers, Estampes, Lauall, and many other Erles and Barons
and the prince of Melffe, foure Cardinalles, and a leuen bishoppes with
their traines and resort, whiche surely was a greate compaignie: so continued
these twoo kynges at Bulleyn, Mondaie, Tewesdaie, Wednesdaie,
and Thursdaie, and on Fridaie the .xxv. daie of October, thei departed
out of Bulleyn to Calice: the Frenche kynges train was twelue
hundred persones, and so many horse or more, and without Calice twoo
mile, met with them the Duke of Richemond, the Kynges bastard sonne
of Englande, a goodly young Prince, and full of fauoure and beautie,
with a greate compaignie of noble men, whiche wer not at Bulleyne, so
the Duke with his compaignie, embrased the Frenche kyng, and so did
other noble men, then the lorde of Englande set forward, as the Dukes
of Richemond, Norffolke and Suffolke, the Marques of Excester, the
Erles of Arūdell, Oxford, Surrey, Darby, Worcester, Rutland, Sussex,
and Huntyngdon, the Uiscountes of Lis

Haward, the lorde Matrauerse, the lorde Montacute, the lorde Cobham,
the lorde Sādes, the lorde Bray, the lord Mordāt, the lorde Leonard
Grey, the lorde Clinton, &amp; sir William Fitzwillyam knight, tresorer

                  te nomber of knightes, beside the lustie Esquires and yong
gentlemen. These noble personages and gentlemen of England, accompaignied
the Frenche Lordes to Newnam Bridge, where as Thomas
Palmer, capitain of the fortresse, with a faire compaignie of souldiours
saluted the Kynges, and so thei passed towarde Calice: where at their
commyng, that what out of the Toune and the Castle, and what out of
Ricebancke, and the Shippes in the Hauen, the Frenche men saied thei
neuer heard suche a shotte: And when thei were entered the Mille gate,
all the Souldiours of the Toune, stoode on the one side, appareled in
Redde and Blewe, and on the other side of the stretes, stoode all the seruyng
menne of Englande, in coates of Frenche Tawney, with their lordes
and Masters diuises embraudered, and euery manne a Scarlette
cap and a white fether, whiche made a goodly shewe: there were lodged

in Caleis that night, beside the toune dwellers, eight thousand persones
at the least. The Kyng of Englande brought the Frenche Kyng to his
lodgyng, to the Staple in, where his chamber was hanged with so rich
verdore,The firste Chamber. as hath not been seen, the ground of it was gold and damaske,
and all ouer the tuffes and flowers, were of Satten Silke and Siluer,
so curiously wrought that thei semed to growe, euery chamber was richer
and other:The seconde Chamber. the seconde chamber all of Tissue, with a clothe of estate
of nedle worke, set with great Roses of large pearle. The third was hā
                  ged
with Ueluet,The thirde Chamber. vpon veluet pirled grene and Crimosyn, and embraudered
ouer with braunches, of flowers of Gold Bullion, and garnished
with armes and beastes of thesame golde, set with pearle and stone. If
the Frenche Kyng made good chere to the Kyng of England, and his
trayne at Bulleyne, I assure you he and his trayne, were requited at
Caleis, for the plentie of wylde foule, Uenison, Fishe, and all other thynges
whiche were there, it was marueill to see, for the Kynges Officers
of Englande, had made preparacion in euery place, so that the Frenchemenne
were serued, with suche multitude of diuerse fishes, this Fridaie
and Saterdaie, that the masters of the French kynges houshod, muche
wondered at the prouison. In like wise on the Sondaie, thei had al maner
of fleshe, foule, spice, Uenison, bothe of falowe Dere and redde Dere,
and as for wyne thei lacked none, so that well was thenglishe man that
might wel entertain the French man: the lordes of Fraūce neuer fetched
their viandes, but thei wer sent to them, and often tyme their proporcion
of victaill was so abundaunt, that thei refused a greate parte thereof.
               While the kynges wer thus in Caleis,The trauerses thei roade euery daie to sainct
Marie Churche, where were set twoo trauerses, the one for the Frenche
Kyng, whiche was Crimosyn Ueluet, replenished with greate Roses of
massy Bullion of fine gold, and the seede of thesaied Roses were greate
orient pearle, and about euery Rose, was a wrethe al of pearle and stone
whiche trauerse was muche wondered at by the Frenchemen: the other
trauerse of blewe Ueluet and clothe of Tissue, raised with flowers of siluer
paned, al the blewe Ueluet was embrodered with knottes, and subtle
draughtes, of leaues and braunches, that fewe men could iudge the
cunnyng of the workemanship. The sundaie at night, the French kyng
supped with the kyng of England,The Supper made to the French kyng. in a chamber hanged with tissue, reised
with siluer, paned with cloth of siluer, reised with golde, &amp; the semes
of thesame wer couered with brode wrethes, of goldsmithes worke, full
of stone and perle. In this chamber was a coberd of .vii. stages high al

x. braūches of siluer &amp; gilt, &amp; .x. braunches al white siluer, euery braūche
hangyng by a long chain of thesame sute, beryng .v. lightes of waxe. To
tell the riches of the clothes of estates, the basens &amp; other vessels whiche
was there occupied, I assure you my wit is insufficiēt, for there was nothyng
occupied that night, but all of gold. The Frēch kyng was serued
iii. course, &amp; his meat dressed after the Frēch fashion, &amp; the kyng of England

had like courses after thenglishe fashion, the first course of euery
kyng was .xl. dishes, the second .lx. y• third .lxx. which wer costly &amp; plesant

in Maskyng apparel, of straunge fashion, made of clothe of gold, compassed
with crimosyn Tinsell Satin, owned with Clothe of Siluer,
liyng lose and knit with laces of Golde: these ladies were brought into
the chamber, with foure damoselles appareled in Crimosin sattyn, with
Tabardes of fine Cipres: the lady Marques tooke the Frenche Kyng,
and the Countes of Darby, toke the Kyng of Nauerr, and euery Lady
toke a lorde, and in daunsyng the kyng of Englande, toke awaie the ladies
visers, so that there the ladies beauties were shewed, and after thei
had daunsed a while thei ceased, and the Frenche Kyng talked with the
Marchiones of Penbroke a space, &amp; then he toke his leaue of the ladies,
and the kyng conueighed hym to his lodgyng: thesame night the Duke
of Norffolke feasted all the nobles of Fraunce, beyng there in the castle
of Caleis, with many goodly sportes and pastymes.
               On the Mondaie beeyng Simon and Iudes daie, there dined with
the kyng of Englande, the kyng of Nauerr, &amp; the Cardinall of Lorrain,
and the greate Master, &amp; Admirall of Fraunce, on whiche daie the kyng
of Englande, called a Chapiter of the knightes of the Gartier, at whiche
Chapiter the Frenche kyng ware the Blewe Mantell of the ordre, because
he was of thesame ordre, and there wer elected, Annas Memorancie
Erle of Beaumont, greate Master of the Frenche kinges house, and
Phillip de Chabbot Erle of Newblanke, greate Admirall of Fraunce,
whiche had to them their Collers and Garters deliuered, for the whiche
thei rendered to the kyng greate thankes.
               The morowe after beyng the thirtie daie of October, the two kynges
departed out of Caleis, and came nere to Sādyngfeld, and there alighted
in a faire grene place, where was a table set, and there the Englishemen
serued the Frenchemen of wyne, Ypocras, fruite, &amp; spice abondantly.
When the twoo kynges had communed a litle, thei mounted on their
horses, and at the very enteryng of the Frenche grounde,The Kynges departure. thei toke handes,
and with Princely countenaunce, louyng behauor, and hartie wordes,
eche embrased other and so there departed.
               While the kyng of Englande was in the Frenche kynges dominion,
he had the vpper hande, and like wise had the Frenche kyng, in his dominion,
and as the Frenche kyng paied, al the Englishmennes charges
at Bulleyn, so did the kyng of Englande at Caleis, so that euery thyng
was recōpensed: sauyng that the kyng of England, gaue to the Frenche
kyng, diuerse precious Iuelles &amp; greate horses, and to his nobles great
plētie of plate, for the whiche I could neuer heare, that he gaue the kyng
of Englāde any other thing, but the white goune, as you haue hard, but
to the lordes of the kynges counsaill, he gaue certain plate and chaines.
               When the kyng was returned to Calice, many gentlemen tooke ship
to saile into Englande, but the wynd was so contrariant, that diuerse of

them wer driuen backe again into Calice, and diuerse into Flaunders,

in somuche that the water rose three foote aboue the wharfe, where
the Key stode in Andwarpe: this storme continued till the fourth daie of
Nouember, but for all that the wynd chaunged not. The eight daie rose
suche a Wynde tempest and Thonder, that no man could conueniently
stirre in the streates of Caleis: muche lamentacion was made for theim
that had taken shippe into Englande, for no man knewe what was become
of theim. On Sondaie the wether was faire, the kyng caused his
bedde and other thynges to be shipped, and entended to departe, but sodainly
rose suche a mist, that no Master could guide a ship, and so he taried
that daie. On Tewesdaie at midnight he tooke ship, and landed at
Douer the morowe after, beyng the .xiiii. daie of Nouember, at .v. of the
clocke in the mornyng, wherefore the Saterdaie after, was song Te deum
in the Cathedrall Churche of sainct Paule in London: the Lorde keper

daie, whiche mariage was kept so secrete, that very fewe knewe it, til she
was greate with child, at Easter after.
               When the kyng should passe ouer the sea, he cōsidred that the Scottes
had robbed his subiectes, bothe by sea and land, and that no redresse
was made for thesame, imagined that in his absence, thei would attempt
some outragious enterprise against his people, wherfore like a prudent
prince to be in a suretie, he sent sir Arthur Darcy knight, with thre hundred
tall menne to Barwicke, to defende the inuasions of the Scottes.
The Scottes hearyng of his commyng, came into Northumberlande,
by ye middle Marches, and came to a place called Fowbery, and in their
iorney fired certain villages and returned. Sir Arthur Darcy hearyng
of this auenture, was nothyng contente. Nowe at this season there laie
at Berwicke, Archibald Doglas Erle of Angus, whiche had maried
the Quene of Scottes, the kynges sister, and was banished Scotlande
and she was from hym diuorsed, and maried to another. The Scottes
bragged of their enterprise, and saied that sir Arthur had brought them
good lucke, and said, that he and the Erle of Angus, slepte well in Barwicke:
thei hearyng of this bragge, made a roade with .iiii.C. men into
Scotland, &amp; set a village on fire: then shortly assembled together .viii.C
Scottes. When thenglishemen perceiued the Scottes, thei caused their
trompet to blowe a retreate, and the Erle and .xx. with hym, shewed hym
self on a hill, euen in the face of the Scottes, and the trumpette blewe at
their backes, so that the Scottes thought that there had been ii. compaignies

whiche caused the Scottes to flie, and the Englishemen folowed,
and slewe a great a nomber, and toke many prisoners, and brought them
to Berwicke, the twentie daie of October.
               The Kyng this yere kepte his Christemas at Grenewiche, and after
Christmas sir Thomas Awdeley,Sir Thomas Awdeley made Chauncellor. lorde keper of the greate Seale, was
made Chaunceller of Englande, and when the Parli

the office of the Spekar▪ was voyde, Hūfrey Wyngfeld of Grais
Inne, was elected Spekar of the parliament, whiche was presented accordyng
as you haue heard, of the other Spekar before. In the whiche
Parliament was made an acte, that no persone should appeale for any
cause, out of this realme, to the Courte of Rome, but from Commissarie
to the Bishoppe, and from Bishop to the Archebishop, and from Archebishop
to the kyng, and all causes of the kyng▪ to bee tried in the vpper
house of the Conuocacion. And in thesame Parliament was enacted,
that quene Katheryn should from thence furth, be no more called quene,
but princes Dowager, of prince Arthur.
               In this Sommer season last past died Willyam Warham Archebishoppe
of Cantorbury, and to that Bishopriche was named, Doctor
Thomas Cranmer, the kynges chappelein, a manne of good learnyng,
and of a verteous life, which also not long before, was the kynges Ambassador

                  e, but muche better in the Cōuocacion house, but in both houses

                  ricke, Toletane, and diuerse other famous Counsailes, in
the primitiue Churche, yea, in the tyme of sainct Augustine, it was affirmed,
delcared, &amp; determined, that a cause risyng in one Prouince, should
be determined in thesame, and that neither the patriarcke of Constantinople,
should medle in causes moued in the iurisdicciō of the patriarcke
of Antioche, nor no bishop should entermit, within anothers Prouince
or countrey: whiche thynges were so clerkely opened, so connyngly sette
furthe to all intentes, that euery man that had witte, and was determined
to folowe the truth, and not affeccionate nor wilfully wedded to his
awne mynd, might plainly se that all appeles made to Rome, wer clerely
voyde and of none effect: whiche Doctrines and Counsailes, wer shewed
to the lady Katerine Princes Dowager, but she (as women loue to
lose no dignitie) euer cōtinued in her old song, trustyng more to the Popes
parcialitie, then to the determinacion of Christes veritie. Wherupō
the Archebishop of Cantorbury, accompaignied with the bishoppes of
London, Winchester, Bathe, Lincolne, and diuerse other great clerkes,
in a greate nomber rode to Dunstable, whiche is sixe myle frō Ampthil,
where the Princes Dowager laye, and there by a Doctor called Doctor
Lee, she was ascited to appere before thesaied Archebishoppe, in cause of
Matrimonie, in thesaied toune of Dunstable, and at the daie of apparaunce
she would not appere, but made defaute, and so she was called
peremptorie,The Kyng &amp; quene Katherine▪ diuorsed euery daie .xv. daies together, and at the laste for lacke of
apparaunce, and for c

                  tumacie, by thassent of all the learned men there
beyng present, she was diuorsed from the kyng, and their Mariage declared
to be voyde and of none effecte, whiche sentence geuen, the Archebishop
and all the other, returned whether it pleased them.
               After whiche diuorse sued, many wise menne saied, that the kyng was
not well counsailed, to mary the lady Anne Bulleyne, before the diuorse
were adiudged, for by mariyng before the firste mariage was dissolued,
thei said, that the second mariage might be brought in question, and verely
thei saied true, for so it was in the monethe of Maie, three yere folowyng,
as you shall here after, when I come to the tyme. Of this diuorse
euery man spake, as his discrecion and wisedom was, for wise men saied
that it was Godly and honorably doen, for the discharge of the Kynges
conscience, and profitable for the suretie of the realme, and that God loued
this mariage, consideryng that the newe Quene, was so sone with
childe. Other saied that the bishop of Rome, would cursse all Englishemen,
and that themperor and he, would inuade the realme, and destroye
the people, and specially the Spanyardes bosted muche, but thankes be
to God, their doynges wer muche lesse then their wordes: but after euery
man had talked inough, there was no more communyng of the matter,
but all was in peace▪
               
               
                  A litle before this tyme was there a worshipfull esquier in Glocester
shyre called Wyllyam TracyWylliam Tracy. of Todyngton whiche made in his wyll
that he would no funeral pompe at his buriyng, neither passed he vpon
Masse, and farther sayd that he trusted in God onely &amp; hopyng by him
to besaued and not by no saint, This gentleman dyed and his sonne as
executor brought y• wil to the bishop of Cauntorbury to proue, whiche
he shewed to the cōuocacion and there vnaduisedly they adiudged him
to be taken out of the ground and to be brent as an heretike, and sent a
commission to doctor P
                     •
                  rker chauncelor of the dyoces of Worcester to
execute their sentence, whiche accomplished the same. The kyng hearyng
his subiect to be exhumate &amp; brent without his knowlege or order
of his lawe sent for the Chauncelor and layde the high offence to him,
whiche excused him by the archebishop of Caūtorbury whiche was late
dead: but in conclusion it cost him CCC. pound to haue his pardon.
But yet for a farther trueth to be knowen of this gentlemans death, &amp;
the cruel ignoraūcye of the bishoppes, I haue here expressed his wylle
worde by worde as foloweth.
               In the name of God Amen, I Wyllyam Tracy of Todyngton in y•
countie of Gloucester esquier make my Testament &amp; last wille as hereafter
foloweth. Fyrst and before al other thinges I commit me vnto
God and to his mercy, beleuyng without any doubt or mistrust that by
his grace and the merites of Iesus Christ, &amp; by the vertue of his passion
and of his resurreccion I haue and shal haue remission of my sinnes
and resurreccion of body and soule according as it is written,Iob. 
                        〈◊〉
                     . I beleue
that my redemer lyueth, and that in the last day I shall ryse out of the
yearth and in my fleshe shall see my sauior, this my hope is layde vp in
my bosome.
               And touchyng the wealth of my soule, the fayth that I haue taken &amp;
rehersed is sufficient (as I suppose) without any other mannes worke
or workes. My ground and belefe is, that there is but one God &amp; one
mediator between God and man, whiche is Iesus Christ, so that I accept
none in heauen nor in yerth to be mediator betwene me and God,
but onely Iesus Christ, all other be but peticioners in receiuyng of
grace, but none hable to geue influence of grace. And therfore will I
bestowe no part of my goodes for that entent that any man should say,
or do, to helpe my soule, for therin I trust onely to the promises of God:
he that beleueth and is baptized shalbe saued,Marke .xvi. and he that beleueth not
shalbe damned.
               As touchyng the buriyng of my body, it auaileth me not whatsoeuer
be done therto▪ for saint Augustine sayeth de cura agenda pro mortuis
that the funeral pompes are rather the solace of them that liue, then for
the welth and comforte of them that are dede, and therfore I remitte it
onely to the discrecion of myne executors.
               And touchyng the distribucion of my temporal goodes, my purpose
is by the grace of God to bestowe them, to be accepted as the fruites of

fayth so that I do not suppose that my merite is by good bestowyng of
them, but my merite is the fayth of Iesus Christ onely,Math .xxv. by whom suche
workes are good accordyng to the wordes of our lorde: I was hungry
and thou gauest me to eat .&amp;c. and it foloweth, that ye haue done to the
least of my brethren ye haue done it to me .&amp;c. and euer we should consider
the true sentence, that a good worke maketh not a good man, but
a good man maketh a good worke:Roma .xiiii. for fayth maketh the mā both good
and righteous, for a righteous man liueth by fayth: and whatsoeuer
spryngeth not of fayth is synne.
               And all my temporal goodes that I haue not geuen or deliuered or
not geuen by writyng of myne own hand bearyng the date of this present
writyng, I do leaue and geue to Margaret my wyfe &amp; to Richard
my sonne whom I make myne Executors. Wytnes this myne owne
hand, the x. day of October in the xxii. yere of the reigne of kyng Henry
the viii.
               This is the true copy of his wille, for the whiche as you haue heard
before after he was almoste thre yeres dead, they toke him vp and burned
him.
               In the moneth of Maye Pope Clement sent an Orator to the kyng
at Grenewyche certifiyng him that he had appointed a generall counsail
to be kept at Mantua the yere folowing, and therof had aduertised
all princes Christen, requiryng the kyng likewyse as he did all other
princes Christen for the vniuersal welth of all Christendome and for y•
quietyng of opinions newly growen, to appeare there personally: to the
whiche it was answered that it was both ieopardeous for y• kyng &amp; for
his whole realme to haue their prince absent for feare of inuasions by
vtward enemies, but he sayd he would sende thither a sufficient procuracie
and conuenient proctors, &amp; desired to see the Orators commission.
               When he with an euil will had shewed his commission, there appered
neither place nor tyme of the counsail. For the kyng knew well before
his commyng that the Marques of Mantua had made a full denial
to the pope that he would haue no suche assemble to be kept in his
citie nor dominions for diuers great and vrgent causes, &amp; so the popes
Orator departed with an vncertain answere to an vncertain demaund
but not vnrewarded.
               The kyng beyng aduertised by the Frenche kyng how that he and y•
Pope should mete at Nece in Iune folowyng, thought it conuenient
to sende a solempne Ambassade to y• Frenche kyng both to accompany
him to Nece and also to comon with the bishop of Rome concernyng
his vnlawfull stay in the kynges deuorce: wher vpon he appointed the
duke of Norffolke, the lorde Rocheforde brother to the newe quene, sir
Wyllyam Pawlet comptroller of the kynges housholde, sir Anthonye
Browne &amp; sir Fraunces Bryan knightes to be his ambassadors which
made great prouision for that purpose and so with the nomber of Clx.
horses came to Douer and so to Calys on Whitson eue, on whiche day

the quene made her entry through the citie of London toward her coronacion)
where thei made their abode a certain space and passed through
all Fraunce till they came to Lyons, where they remayned a space as
you shall here after.
               This very season was daily skirmishyng betwene the borderers of
the Marches of England and Scotland, and yet no warre proclaimed
and many robberies, murders and māslaughters done on both partes,
and although the cōmissioners of the realmes of England &amp; of Scotlay
at Newcastle vpō Tyne entreatyng a truce and amitie, yet duryng
the communicacion the Scottes ceased not to robbe both by sea &amp; land,
and toke dyuers litle botes laden with corne and fishe, wherof hearyng
the kyng of England, he decked and vitailed dyuers shippes of warre
and sent them to the North seas to defende his subiectes. The Scottes
hearyng that the Englishe nauye was come on their cost, in al hast fled
home to their harbor, but yet the Englishemen folowed then &amp; fetched
many of their praies out of their hauens maugre of their heades.
               In the beginnyng of May the kyng caused open Proclamacions to
be made that al men that claimed to do any seruice or execute any office
at the solempne feast of the coronacion, by the way of Tenor, graunt or
prescripcion should put their graunt iii. wekes after Ester in the starre
chamber before Charles duke of Suffolke for that tyme high steward
of England and the lorde Chauncelor and other commissioners.
               The duke of Norffolke claymed to be erle Marshall and to exercise
his office at that feast. The erle of Arrondell claymed to be high butler
and to exercise thesame: the erle of Oxforde claymed to be chamberlain:
the vicount Lys
                     •
                  e claymed to be panter: the lorde Burgaine to the chiefe
larderer, and the lord Bray claimed to be almoner, and sir Henry Wiat
knight claymed to be ewrer: All these noble parsonages desired their
offices with their fees. Besyde these the Maior of London claymed to
serue the quene with a cuppe of golde and acuppe of assay of the same,
and that xii. citizens should attende on the cupborde and the Maior to
haue the cuppe and cuppe of assay for his labor, whiche peticion was
allowed. The v. Portes claymed to beare a Canapie ouer the quenes
head the daye of the Coronacion with .iiii. gilte Belles and to haue the
same for a rewarde whiche also to them was allowed. Dyuers other
put in petie claymes whiche were not allowed because they semed only

                  e done at the kynges coronacion. All this season great purueiaūce
was made of all maner of vitailes, and lordes, knightes and squiers
were sent for out of all countreys whiche came to London at their day
with a great nomber of people.

                     After that the kynges highnes had addressed his gracious letters to
the Maior and cominaltie of the citie, signifiyng to them that his pleasure
was to solempnise and celebrate the coronacion of his moste deare
and welbeloued wyfe Quene Anne at Westminster the Whitsonday
nexte ensuyng, willyng theim to make preparacion aswell to fetche her
grace from Grenewyche to the Tower by water as to see the citie ordered
and garnished with pageaūtes in places accustomed, for the honor
of her grace. When she should be conueyed from the Tower to Westminster,
there was a common counsail called, and cōmaundement was
geuen to the Haberdashers (of which craft the Maior sir Stephen Pecocke
then was) that they should prepare a barge for the Batchelers
with a wafter and a foyst garnished wich banners and streamers likewyse
as they vse to dooe when the Maior is presented at Westminster
on the morowe after Symon and Iude. Also all other craftes were
commaunded to prepare barges and to garnishe them not alonely with
their banners accustomed, but also to decke theim with Targettes by
the sides of the barges, and so set vp all suche semely banners and bannorettes
as thei had in their halles or could gette mete to furnishe their
sayd barges, and euery barge to haue mynstrelsie, accordyng to whiche
commaundementes great preparacion was made for all thynges necessary
for suche a noble triumph.

Mari Hyll, and at one of the clocke discended to the Newstayre to their

After that the Maior and his brethren wer in their barge seyng that all
the companyes to the nomber of fiftie barges were ready to wayte vpō

should rowe nerer to another then twyse the length of the barge vpon

their order, after whiche commaundement geuen they set forth in order
as hereafter is discribed.
                  Fyrst before the Maiors barge was a Foyst or Wafter full of ordinaunce,
in whiche Foyst was a great Dragon continually mouyng, &amp;
castyng wyldfyer, and round about the sayd Foyst stode terrible monsters
and wylde men castyng fyer, and makyng hidious noyses: Next
after the Foyst a good distaunce came the Maiors barge, on whose
right hand was the Batchelers barge, in the whiche were trumpettes
and diuers other melodious instrumentes. The deckes of the sayd

barge and the sailyardes and the toppe castles were hanged with riche
cloth of golde and silke. At the foreship and the Sterne were two great

The sides of the barge was sette full of Flagges and banners of

and the cordes were hāged with innumerable penselles hauyng

                        •
                     owed to Grenewyche to the point next beyond Grenewyche, and there
they turned backward in another order, that is to wete, the Maior and
Shiriffes officers first, and the meanest craft next, and so ascendyng to
the vttermost craftes in order and ye Maior last as they go to Poules
at Christmas, and in that order they rowed douneward to Grenewiche

set forwardes in their order, their minstrels continually plaiyng,
and the Batchelers barge goyng on the quenes right hand whiche she

Wylshyre her father, the Erles of Arrondel, Darby, Rutland, Worceter,
Huntyngton, Sussex, Oxford, and many bishoppes and noblemen

the shippes whiche were commaunded to lye on the shore for lettyng of
the barges shotte diuers peales of gunnes, and or she landed there was

countenaunce at the Posterne by the water syde and kyssed her, &amp; then

she turned backe againe and thanked the Maior and the citezens with

the Recorder and two Aldermen. But for to speake of the people that
stode on euery shore to beholde the sight, he that sawe it not would not

face when she list to spet or do otherwyse at her pleasure. At the tables
ende satte the archebishoppe of Cauntorbury on the right hande of the
quene, and in the myddest betwene the archebishoppe and the countesse
of Oxforde stode the erle of Oxforde with a white staffe all diner tyme,
and at the quenes feete vnder the table satte .ii. gentlewomen all dyner
tyme. When all these thynges were thus ordered came in the Duke
of Suffolke and the lorde Wyllyam Haward on horsebacke and the
sergeauntes of armes before them, and after them the Sewer, and then
the knightes of the bath bringyng in the first course whiche was xxviii.
dishes beside subtilties and shippes made of waxe meruailous gorgious
to beholde, all whiche tyme of seruice the trumpettes stāding in the
wyndow at the netherende of the halle played melodiously. When her
grace was setued of two dishes, then the archebishoppes seruice was
set doune, whose Sewer came equal with the thirde dishe of the quenes
seruice on his left hand. After that the quene and the archebishop was
serued, the Barons of the portes began the table on the right hand next
the wall, next them at the table sat the masters and clerkes of the chaū
                     cery,
and beneth them at the table other doctors and gentlemen. The
table next the walle on the left hande by the cupborde was begon by the
Maior and Aldermen the chamberlain and the counsail of the citie of
Lōdon, and beneth them satte substancial marchaūtes, &amp; so douneward
other worshipfull persones. At the table on the right hand in ye middes
of the halle sat the lorde Chauncelor and other temporall lordes on the

the right side of the table, in their circottes: And on the lefte side of thesame
table, sat Bishoppes and Abbottes in their Parliament robes, beneth
them sat the Iudges, Seriantes, and the kynges counsaill, beneth
thē the knightes of the Bathe. At the table on the left hande, in the middle
part, sat Ducheses, Marqueses, Countesses, Baronesses, in their robes,
and other ladies in circottes, and gentle women in gounes. Al whiche
ladies and gentle women, sat on the left side of the table a long, and
none on the rightside: and when all were thus set, thei were incontinent
serued and so quickely, that it was maruaill, for the seruitors gaue such
good attendance, that meate or drynke ne any thyng els, neded not to be
called for, whiche in so greate a multitude was maruaill. As touchyng
the fare ther could be deuised, no more costlier dishes nor subtilties. The
Maior of London was serued with .xxxiii. dishes at twoo courses, and
so wer all his brethren, and suche as sat at his table. The Quene had at
her seconde course .xxiiii. dishes, and thirtie at the thirde course: and betwene
the twoo last courses, the kynges of Armes cried Larges, in three
partes of the hall: and after stode in their place, which was in the bekins
at the kynges Benche. And on the right hande, out of the Cloyster of. S.
Stephēs, was made a litle Closet, in whiche the kyng with diuerse Ambassadors,

lorde Willyam, rode often tymes aboute the hall, cheryng the lordes, ladies,
and the Maior and his brethren. After thei all had dined, thei had
Wafers and Ypocras, and then thei washed, and were commaunded to
rise, and to stande still in their places, before the table or on the fourmes
till the Quene had washed: when she had taken Wafers and Ypocrase,
the table was taken vp, and the Erle of Rutlande brought vp the surnap,
and laied it at the bordes ende, which immediatly was drawen, and
cast by Master Rode, Marshal of the hall: And the Quene washed, and
after the Archebishop, and after the Surnap was drawen of, she arose
and stode in the middes of the Hall place: to whom the Erle of Sussex
in a goodly spice plate, brought a voyde of spice and comfettes. After
hym the Maior of London, brought a standyng cuppe of golde, set in a
cup of assaie of gold, and after that she had dronke, she gaue the Maior
the Cuppe, with the Cuppe of assaie, because there was no leyar, accordyng
to the claime of the citee, thankyng hym &amp; all his brethren, of their
pain. Then she vnder her Canapie, departed to her Chamber, and at the
entry of her Chamber, she gaue the Canapy with Belles and all, to the
Barons of the Portes, accordyng to their clayme, with greate thankes.
Then the Maior of London bearyng his Cuppe in his hande, with his
brethren, went through the hall to their barge, and so did all other noble
men and gentlemen, for it was sixe of the clocke.
                  On Mondaie were the Iustes at the Tilte, before the Kynges gate,
where the Maior and his brethren had a goodly stādyng: but there wer
very fewe speres broken, by reason the horses would no cope.
                  On Wednesdaie, the Kyng sent for the Maior and his brethren to

Westminster, and there he hymself gaue to theim hartie thankes, with
many goodly wordes.
                  On Midsomer daie after, the lady Mary the Frenche Quene died in
Suffolke, at the lordship of who was the late wife to Lewes the
xii. and after maried to Charles duke of Suffolk, and was buried at

where were many lordes, knightes, and gentlemen assembled. All
the walles betwene the Kynges place and the Friers, were hanged with
Arras, and all the waie strawed with grene Rushis: the Friers Church
was also hanged with Arras. The Funt was of siluer, and stoode in the
middes of the Churche, three steppes high, whiche was couered with a
fine clothe, and diuerse gentlemen with aperns, and towelles about their
neckes, gaue attendaunce aboute it, that no filthe should come in the

countes of Kent bare the long train of the childes mantell, and betwene
the Countes of Kent and the child, went therle of Wilshire on the right

obseruaunces of the Sacrament. The Godfather was the lorde Archebishop
of Cantorbury: the Godmothers were the old Duches of Norffolke,
and the olde Marchiones of Dorset widowes, and the childe was

the child was brought to the Fount, and christened, and this doen, Garter
chief kyng of armes cried a loude, God of his infinite goodnes, sende
prosperous life and long, to the high and mightie Princes of England
Elizabeth: and then the trumpettes blewe, then the childe was brought

the Archebishop of Cantorbury confirmed it, the Marchiones of Excester
beyng Godmother, then the Archebishop of Cantorbury, gaue to

Then was brought in Wafers, Comfettes, Ypocras in suche plentie,

                  This yere also, one PauierPauyer. toune clerke of the citee of London, hanged
himself, whiche surely was a man, that in nowise could abide to here
that the Gospell should bee in Englishe, and I my self heard hym once
saie to me &amp; other that wer by, swearyng a great othe, that if he thought
the kynges highnes, would set furth the scripture in Englishe, and set it
be red of the people by his aucthoritie, rather then he would so long liue
he would cut his awn throte, but he brake promes, for as you haue hard
he hanged hymself: but of what mynde and intent he so did, God iudge.

                  In September the kyng of Scottes, sent his Commissioners to the
toune of Newe Castle, where wer for the kyng of Englande commissioners
sir Thomas Clifford, and doctor Magnus, and sir Raufe Elderkare.
And first the Scottes without any long communicacion, demaunded
greate amendes, saiyng, that the Englishmen had robbed and spoyled
theim to their losse, and that greatly, and saied that the kyng of England
of his honor, must nedes make satisfaccion, if he would be called
honorable. Then it was answered, that notwithstandyng the leagues,
written, sealed and sworne, the Scottishe naciō would neuer kepe peace
in somuch, while we be here in treatyng, your people are robbyng: wherfore
the kyng demaundeth of you, the goodes and prisoners taken contrary
to the peace, wherof we here deliuer you a writyng, which the Scottes
receiued, and at their next metyng thei saied, that the shippes to them
wer lawfull prises, by reason that therle of Anguishe, was maintened in
Englande, whiche is rebel to our kyng, and therle and you haue doen to
vs muche skathe, &amp; we haue taken a few shippes, in recompence of some
pa
                        •
                     t of our greate losses, whiche we maie not deliuer, &amp; therfore, we parie
you demaunde theim not: but here wee deliuer you our boke, whiche amounteth

to a greater somme by tenne thousande marke. The Englishe
commissioners receiued the boke, and in thesame the Scottes demaunded,
recompence for burnyng their tounes, and destroiyng many of their
strong Piles, aboue .xxiiii, whiche were destroyed from the .xxiiii. daie of
Aprill, in the laste .xxiiii. yere of the kyng, to the .xxx. daie of Aprill. The
Englishe cōmissioners answered, that if the Scottes would send to the
kyng of Englāde, thei doubted not, but thei should haue a good answer
for the kyng of Englande bad hym chose peace or warre: so thei agreed
to sende to bothe their kynges letters of their doynges, whiche in haste
was dooen. And after muche suite of the Scottes parte, when thei had
muche demaunded, and litle or nothyng was graunted, thei then beyng
wery of warre desired peace, whiche was concluded, duryng bothe the
kynges liues, and the twentie daie of Maie, in the next yere of the kyng
folowyng, it was openly Proclaimed, to the greate comforte and reioysyng
of all louers of peace.
                  The .xviii. daie of December, the Duke of Suffolke was sent by the
kyng and his counsaill, to Bugden beside Huntyngdon, where the lady
Katheryne Princes Dowager laye. For the Kyng was aduertised, and
had good proues of thesame, that she of froward mynde would consent,
neither to the determinacion of the Uniuersities, nor yet to the sentence
of the whole conuocacion of the realme, but beyng counsailed by a fewe
Spaniardes, whiche had litle lernyng, did all that she could to infringe
the determinacion of thesaid Uniuersities and clergie. In somuche that
she wrote to the Pope, and to other potentates, to greue the Kyng and
his realme, because he would not folowe her mynd, and breake the commaundement
of God. Wherefore the Kynges counsaill mocioned the
kyng, that suche as wer about her, and moued her thereto, should be put
from her, for thei thought it no reason, that she should haue suche libertie
to woorke that 
                        •
                     hyng, by the whiche the kyng ans his realme, might
haue detriment or damage. Wherefore thesaied Duke was sent to her,
whiche shewed to her openly, Articles of her suites to the Pope, and
howe she soughte meanes to greue the Kyng and his Realme, whiche
hereafter she should not be suffered to dooe. For thesame tyme was a
Cursse sent from the Pope,The Pope accurssed the Kyng and Realme. whiche accurssed bothe the Kyng, and the
whole Realme, whiche Cursse the bearer thereof, beeyng not by like thē
hardiest manne that euer shewed hymself in front of battaill, thought it
a greate deale more better for hym to bestowe it without the Kynges
reche, then to aduenture to come within his Dominions, and therefore
set it vp in the Toune of Dunkercke in Flaunders, where it was taken
doune by Wyllyam Locke, Mercer of London.Willyā Lock Mercer. The Quene answered
the Duke very highly and obstinately, with many high woordes,
and sodainly in a fury she departed from hym, into her priuie Chamber
and shutte the doore. He seeyng that, brake all the ordre of the Quenes
Courte, and discharged a greate sorte of her housholde seruauntes, and
yet lefte there a conuenient nomber, to serue her like a Princes. There

was greate lamentacion emong theim that departed, but there was no
remedy. Then thei that remaigned to serue her, were sworne to serue her
as a Princes Dowager, and not as Quene, some saied thei were sworne
to her as Quene, and otherwise thei would not serue, and so thei departed.
Other that wer sworne to serue her as Princes, and remained there,
she them vtterly refused for her seruauntes, wherfore she remained with
the lesse nomber of seruauntes.
                  The kyng kept his Christmas at Grenewiche, with greate solempnitee,
and after Christmas beganne the Parliament. In whiche Parliament
Elizabeth Barton, the holy Maide of Kent, with all her adherentes,
of whom ye haue heard before, was attaynted. And because her offences,
were bothe against God and the kyng, so greate and wicked, that
the like was neuer heard nor knowen before, I will declare vnto you
the processe of her matter, in suche maner as the truthe thereof, is declared
in her attainder, by Acte of Parliament. Firste thesaied Elizabeth
Barton (beeyng a Nonne professed in the house and Priory of Sainct
S
                        •
                     pulcres of Cauntorbury) whiche long before 
                        •
                     he was professed
Nonne, dwelled with one Thomas Cobbe, in the Parishe of Aldyngton,
in the Countie of Kent, and happened to bee visited with sickenes,
and by occasion thereof, brought in suche debilitie and weakenes of her
brayne, because she could not eate ne drynke, by a long space, that in the
violence of her infirmitie, she semed to bee in Traunses, and spake and
vttered many foolishe and Idle woordes. And one Richarde Master,
Clerke, beeyng Persone of thesaied Parishe of Aldyngton, in thesaied
Countie of Kent, after that he had made to the late Archebishoppe of
Cauntorbury, a farre and a larger reporte, concernyng the Hypocrisy,
traunses and speaches of thesaied Elizabeth, then he could iustifie and
abide by, and after that he was commaunded by thesaied Archebishop,
to geue good attendaunce vpō her, if she shoud fortune to haue any 
                        ••
                     o
suche traunses and speaches, and to sende hym knowlege thereof, to the
intent to mainteigne, vphold and verefy, suche reporte as he had made,
aswell to the Archebishoppe aforesaied, as to other, of the wounderfull
traunses and speaches of thesaied Nonne, he falsely and craftely informed
thesaid Elizabeth, that the merueilous wordes whiche she spake in
her traunses, afore his ridyng to the Archebishop aforsaied, proceded of
the inspiracion of the holy ghost, and that she was greatly to be blamed
if she would hide or dissemble the wonderfull workes of God shewed to
her: for afore this his saied informacion and instruccion, she saied constantly,
that she could not remember, that she spake any suche notable
wordes in her traunses, as were reported vnto her, by thesaied Richard
Master. Whiche Elizabeth beeyng in this maner of wise, often tymes
perswaded, procured and informed, by thesaied Persone of Aloyngton,
tooke boldenes and courage to forge, feigne, and counterfeat suche maner
of Tra

                     ses, and craftie speaches, as thesaied Persone of Aldyngton
told her, that she vsed in her sickenes, afore he went to thesaid Archbishoppe.

And when thesaid Elizabeth had vsed, this false, feigned coū
                     terfeatyng
for a ceason, and was perfecte therein (so that the fame thereof,
was greatly spred abroade, in those parties) then thesaied Person, to
the intent aforsaid, and to the intent the people, should geue more faithe
and credite vnto her, and because he would haue increased, the deuocion
of the people, in commyng on pilgrimage to a Chapell, set in Courte at
Stete, within thesaied Parishe, dedicate in the honour of our Lady, for
his awne lucre and auauntage, imagined, deuised, compassed, and declared,
with the aide, helpe, and counsaiill of one Edwarde Bockyng
Monke, professed in the Monastery in Christes Churche in Cauntorbury,
and Doctor in Diuinitee, that thesaied Elizabeth, beyng in the extasy
and extremitie of her sickenes, in a maner distract in traūses, should
saie emongest other wounderfull woordes, that she should neuer take
healthe of her body, till suche tyme as she had visited the Image of our
Lady, beeyng in thesaied Chapell at Courte at Strete aforesaied: and
that our Lady had appered vnto her, and shewed her, that if she came to
thesaied Chapell, at the daie appoynted, she should be restored to her
health by Miracle, where in very deede, she was restored to her perfecte
health, by diet and Phisike, and by the course of nature, whiche expelled
the matter, beyng cause of her sickenes, in the meane tyme while thesaid
person of Aldyngton, was with the Archebishoppe, as is afore rehersed.
And albeit thesaied Elizabeth, was restored to her healthe, yet she beeyng
accustomed and acquainted, with the maner and fashion, of her distracte
Traunses, by the counsaiell, conspiracie, and confede

alteracions, of her sensible partes of her body, craftely vtteryng in her
saied feigned and false Traunses, diuerse and many verteous and holy
woordes, tendyng to the rebuke of synne, and in reprouyng of suche
newe opinions, as then beganne to spryng in this Realme, whiche she
called Heresyes, as she was induced and taught, by thesaied Edwarde
Bockyng and Richarde Master, vsyng all the waies of false Hypocrisy,
to the intent the people should geue belefe and credence vnto her,
whereby thei might bee the soner brought, into the detestable crymes of
blasphemie and Idolatrie, agaynste almightie GOD. And thesaied
Edwarde Bockyng, beeyng maliciously fixed in his opinion, agaynste
the Kynges highnes, in his detested Matrimonie with Quene Katheryne,
and intendyng in his mynde, afterwardes for his parte, falsely
and Trayterously to vse thesaied Elizabeth, as a Diabolicke instrument,
to stirre, moue, and prouoke the people of this Realme aswell nobles
as other, to murmoure and grudge, agaynste the Maiestie of
oure Soucreigne Lorde, and all his iuste and Lawfull procedynges,
in thesaied Deuorce and feperacion, as after he did in very deede: for
the accomplishyng of his saied false, malicious and Trayterous intentes,

falsely deuised and conspired, with thesaied Richarde, that thesaied
Elizabeth should shewe and manifest her self, to the people, to bee an excellent
verteous and an holy woman, and that all her woordes and deedes,
should appere to the worlde, to procede of a maru

                     ilous holines,
rebukyng the common synnes and vices of the worlde, as though she
were taught and inspired, of the holy spirite of God. And not onely moued
and counsailed thesaied Elizabeth, thus to vse her self, surmittyng
to her that she spake suche thynges, in the extasy of her sickenes, that
came by the inspiracion of God, but also counsailed and procured thesaied
Elizabeth, to bee brought and conueighed, to thesaied Chapell of
oure Lady, and therein openly in the presence of the people, (that there
should be assembled by their procurementes) should vse and experiment
suche like Traunses, and alteracions of her face, and other the outward
sensible partes of her body, as she vsed in the extremitie and extasy of
her sickenes. To whose counsailes and aduertisementes, thesaied Elizabeth
agreed. Whereupon at a daie by them appoynted and agreed, thesaied
Edward and Richard, laboured, solicited, and procured, aboue the
nomber of twoo thousande persones, to repaire to thesaied Chapel, surmittyng
that thesaied Elizabeth, whiche as thei saied, had marueilous
and many Uisions and Reuelacions of God, should bee broughte thether,
and there receiue her healthe, by Miracle of oure Lady, whose Image
was in thesaied Chapell. By reason of whiche false, feigned and
detestable conspiracy and Hypocrysy, at the daie by theim appoynted,
there assembled to thesaied Chapell, aboue the nomber of twoo thousande
people. At whiche daie also, thesaied Edwarde Bockyng, and Richarde
Master procured, and caused thesaied Elizabeth, to repaire to
thesaied Chapell, where thesaied Elizabeth, albeit she at that tyme, and
long afore was restored to healthe of her bodie, and discharged of her
tormentes and affliccions, whiche she had in the extasy of her sickenes:
Yet neuertheles by the procurement and craftie counsaill of thesaied
Edwarde Bockyng, and Richard Master, did falsely feigne and shewe
vnto the people in thesame Chapell, many alteracions of her face, and
other outward sensible partes of her body, and falsely feigned and shewed
her self in Traunces, vtteryng wonderous woordes, as she was
before subtelly and craftely induced and taught, by thesaied Richarde
and Edwarde to dooe. And emonges other thynges she vttered, that it
was the pleasure of God, that thesaied Edwarde Bockyng, should bee
her ghostly father, and that she should bee a Religious woman, as she
was taught by thesaied Edward Bockyng, and Richard Master. And
within a while after demonstracion, of suche false feigned and dissimuled
traunces, she appered to the people, to bee sodainly reueled from her
sickenes and affliccions, by the intercession and meanes of the Image
of oure Lady, beeyng in thesame Chapell. By meanes of whiche false
feigned Hypocrysy, dissimuled and cloked Sanctitee, so conspired and
craftely imagined by thesaied Edwarde Bockyng, and Richarde Master,

thesaied Elizabeth was brought into a meruellous fame, credite
and good opinion, of a greate multitude of the people of this Realme.
And to increase the 
                        •
                     ame of thesaid false feigned Hypocrisy, thesaid Elizabeth
after wardes, by the counsaill and procurement of thesaied Edwarde
Bockyng, entered into Religion, and became a Nonne, professed
in thesaied Priory of Sainct Sepulchres, to whom thesaied Edwarde
Bockyng, had commonly his resorte, not without probable, vehement,
and violent suspicion of incontinencie, pretendyng to bee he
                        •
                     
Ghostly father, by Goddes appoyntment. And by conspiracy betwene
her and him, caused her still to persist and abide, in the practisyng of her
said false hipocrisy, and dissimulyng traunces and raptes. And that she
should surmit to the people, that when she was in suche simuled alteraciō,
of her sensible partes of her body, that she was then rapt by almightie
God, from thaffeccions of this worlde, and tolde by the holy spirite of
God, many thynges that should folowe to the worlde, for punishement
of the synnes of the princes and the people. And that she should also 
                        〈◊〉
                     
that she was muche prouoked &amp; tempted, aswell to the synne of the fleshe
as otherwise, by her ghostly enemie the deuill, at diuerse and sondry tymes,
and in diuerse and sondery waies and fashions. And yet neuer theles
that she by the grace of almightie God was preserued, and stedfastly
resisted suche temptacion. By occasion of whiche counsaill and procurement,
of thesaid Edward Bockyng, thesaid Elizabeth by continuaunce
of tyme, toke suche a courage vpon her, that she falsely feined and saied,
that she had many reuelacions, of almightie God and his holy saincte
                        •
                     ,
with heuenly lightes, heuenly voyces, heuenly melodies and ioyes, and
specially in a chapell of .s. Giles, in thesaid Nonnery, to the whiche chapell,
she often tymes resorted, to receiue visions and reuelacions, as cō
                     maunded
by God, as she falsely reported, and specially by night saiyng,
that the Dorture doore was made open to her by Goddes power, vtteryng
thesame, aswell to thesaied Edward Bockyng, as to diuerse other
persones. By the whiche her false feined reuelacions, &amp; cloked hipocrisy,
she was reputed emongest many people of this realme, to be a very holy
woman, inspired with God, where in very deede, she neuer had vision or
reuelacion from God, as she hath plainly and openly, confessed her self.
And therefore her stealyng furthe of the Dorture in the nighte, whiche
was not once or twise wekely was not for spiritual busines, nor to receiue
reuelaciōs of God, but rather for bodely cōmunicaciō &amp; pleasure
with her frēdes, which could not haue so goodleasure &amp; oportunite with
her by daie. Andfor ratificaciō of her false feined reuelaciōs, thesaid Edward
by cōspiracy, betwene him &amp; thesaid Elizabeth, reueled thesame to
the most reuerēt father, Willyā late Archbishop of Cātorbury, who by
false &amp; vntrue surmises, tales and lies of thesaid Edward &amp; Elizabeth,
was allured, brought and induced to credite theim, and made no diligent
serches, for the triall of their saied falsehodes, and consideracions,
but suffered and admitted thesame, to the blasphemie of almightie

god, and to the great deceit of the prince, and people of this realme. And
for a perpetuall memory of thesaid feined and dissimuled hipocrisy, and
false reuelacions of thesaied Elizabeth, thesaied Edward Bockyng, Richard
Master, and one Ihon Deryng; a Monke in thesaid Monastery
of Christes churche a forsaied, made, writ, and caused to be written, sondery
bokes bothe greate &amp; small, bothe printed and written, concernyng
the perticularities of thesaied false and feined hipocrisy, and reuelaciōs
of thesaid Elizabeth, or the defēce or great praise of thesame: surmittyng
and puttyng furth thesame false and feined practises, and reuelaciōs of
thesaid Elizabeth, to be iust &amp; true miracles, shewed by almightie God,
in the fauor of the sanctitee of thesaid Elizabeth, where in dede thei been
and wer falsely deuised, compassed, cōspired, written and mainteined by
thesaid Elizabeth Barton, Edward Bockyng, Richard Master, &amp; Ihō
Deryng, to thonly intēt to bryng thesaid Elizabeth, in the fame and credite
of the people of this realme, wherby the people should the more bee
apt and disposed, by her false cloked hipocrisy and sanctitee, to commit
the crimes of blasphemy, and ydolatrie against God, and also the soner
induced, by the false reuelacions of thesaied Elizabeth to murnor, and
grudge, and be of euill opinion, against the Maiestie of our souereigne
lorde, to the great perill and daūger of his moste royall person. And one
Edward Thwaites gētleman, trāslated and wrote diuerse quaiers, and
shetes of paper, concernyng thesaid false feined reuelacions, of thesaied
Elizabeth. Also one Thomas Laurence of Cantorbury, beyng regester
to tharchebishop of Cantorbury, at thinstance and desire of thesaid Edward
Bockyng, wrote a greate boke of thesaied false &amp; feined miracles,
and reuelacions of thesaid Elizabeth in a faire hand, redy to bee a copie
to the printer, when thesaied boke should be put to stampe.
                  Emonges whiche false and feined reuelacions, surmised by thesaied
Elizabeth, and put in writynges in diuerse bokes, by the false cōspiracie
meanes and procurement of thesaid Edward Bockyng, Richard Master,
Ihon Deryng, and other their complices, there is expressed that the
deuill should appere, to thesaied Elizabeth in diuerse fashions, sometymes
like a man wantonly appareiled, sometyme like a birde deformed,
and sometyme otherwise. And that Mary Magdalene, should often apere
to thesaied Elizabeth, and reuele to her many reuelacions. And at
one tyme should deliuer vnto her, a letter written in heuen, part wherof
was limmed with golden letters, where in deede thesame letters were
written with the hande of a Monke of sainct Augustines in Cantorbury
named Hawkhurst.
                  There was also written and cōteined, emongest thesaid false and feined
miracles &amp; reuelaciōs, that when the kynges highnes was at Calice
in thenteruewe, betwene his maiestie and the Frenche kyng, and heryng
Masse in the Churche of our Lady at Calice, that God was displeased
with the kynges highnes, that his grace sawe not at the Masse the blessed
Sacrament in fourme of bread: for it was taken awaie frō the priest

(beyng at Masse) by an Angell, and ministered vnto thesaid Elizabeth,
then beyng there present and inuisible, and sodainly conueighed &amp; rapt
thence again, by the power of God into thesaied Nonnery, where she is
professed, with many other false feined fables, and tales deuised, conspired
and defended by thesaid Elizabeth, Edward Bockyng &amp; Ihon Deryng,
writcē as miracles in thesaid bokes for a memorial, to set furth the
false and feined hypocrisy, and cloked sanctitee of thesaied Elizabeth, to
the people of this realme, as by thesaied sondery bokes and writynges
therof made, seen and examined by the kynges moste honorable coūsaill
more plainly ape
                        •
                     eth: in whiche bokes be written such termes &amp; sentēces
of reproch and slaunder, against the kynges highnes &amp; the quene, which
wer to shameful to be writtē against the most vile &amp; vngracious persōs
liuyng, whiche to here, would abhorre euery true subiect of this realme.
                  And after thesaid Elizabeth by suche her false &amp; feined hipocrisy, and
dissimuled sanctitee, was brought in a great brute and fame of the people,
in sondry parties of this realme, then thesaid Edward Bockyng by
procurement &amp; secret conspiracy, of diuerse persones vnknowen, whiche
maligned against the kynges procedynges, for the seperacion &amp; deuorse
in thesaied detested &amp; vnlawfull mariage, traiterously intendyng to put
the kynges highnes in a murmor, and euil opinion of his people, for thesame
counsailed and s
                        •
                     irred thesaid Elizabeth, that she should aske a peticiō
of almightie God, to knowe whether God was displeased with the
kynges highnes, for procedyng in thesaid deuorce, and seperacion of the
mariage betwene his highnes, and thesaied lady Katherin, declaryng to
her many tymes, that he &amp; diuerse other learned men of this realme, and
many of the common people of thesame, were in firme opinions that the
kynges procedyng in thesaied deuorce, was against the lawes of God.
Wherupon thesaid Elizabeth subtlely and craftely, concerning the opinion
and mynd of thesaied Edward, willyng to please hym, reueled and
shewed vnto thesaied Edward, that she had knowlege by reuelacion frō
God, that God was highly displeased with our souereigne lorde, for the
same matter And in case he desisted not from his procedinges, in thesaid
deuorce and seperacion, but pursued thesame &amp; maried again, that then
within one moneth after suche mariage, he should no lenger by kyng of
this realme: &amp; in the reputacion of almightie God, should not be a king
one daie, nor one houre: and that he should dye a villeines death: saiyng
farther, that there was a roote with .iii. braunches, &amp; til thei wer plucked
vp, it should neuer be mery in England: interpretyng the roote to be the
late lord Cardinal, and the first braunche to be the kyng our souereigne
lorde, the secōd the duke of Norffolke, and the .iii. the duke of Suffolk.
Whiche false feined reuelaciōs, by the mischeuous &amp; malicious coūsail
and conspiracie of thesaid Edward Bockyng, with y• said Elizabeth, wer
written and expressed, in thesaied bokes and volumes, conteignyng the
false and feined reuelacions and Miracles, of thesaied Elizabeth, for a
perpetuall memory thereof, to the vtter reproche and perell of destruccion

of the Kynges persone, his honor, fame and name▪ and priuely and
secretly, set furthe by thesaied Elizabeth, Edward Bockyng, Ihon Deryng,
and Richarde Master generally to diuerse and many of the kynges
subiectes, and specially as to electe persones, to Ihon Bishoppe of
Rochester, and Ihon Adeson clerke, chapelain to thesaied bishop, and to
one Henry Gold priest, bacheler of Diuinitee, to Hugh Riche Frier Obseruaunt,
and late Wardein of the Friers Obseruauntes of Cantorbury,
whiche beare malice and malignitie, to all the kynges procedynges,
in thesaied deuorse and seperacion, because it was contrary to their peruerse
and froward opinions, intendyng by colour of thesaied false and
feined hypocrisy, and reuelacions of thesaied Elizabeth, not onely to let
thesaied deuorse and seperacion, but also to bryng and set furth secretly,
in the heddes of the people of this realme, aswel nobles as other, that al
the kynges actes and procedynges in thesame, were against holy scriptures,
and the pleasure of almightie God: whereby the kynges highnes
should be brought in a grudge, and euill opinion of his people. And thesaied
Ihon Bishoppe of Rochester, Henry Gold, Hugh Riche, Richard
Risby, Richard Master, Ihon Deryng, at sondery and seuerall tymes
and places, spake with thesaid Elizabeth, and toke relacion of her, of thesaied
false and feined reuelacions, whiche she feined that she had of almightie
God, aswell concernyng the kynges highnes as other, after the
fourme and termes aboue specified. And hauyng knowlege therof, thesaied
Hugh Riche, Richard Risby, and Henry Golde clerke, gaue suche
firme and constant credite thereunto, that thei Trayterously conceled it
frō the kynges highnes, and trayteroyusly beleued in their hartes, that
the Kyng our souereigne Lorde, a
                        •
                     ter the late mariage solempnized, betwene
his highnes, and his moste dere and entierly beloued wife Quene
Anne, was no lenger rightfull kyng of this realme, in the reputacion of
almightie God, whereby in their hartes &amp; willes, thei trayterous
                        •
                     y withdrewe
from his highnes, their naturall dueties of obedience: and secretly
taught and moued other persones (to whom thei reueled thesaid false
and 
                        •
                     eined reuelacions) that thei ought and might lawfully doo in thesame
wise: and practised thesaied matters, against the kynges Maiestie,
falsely, maliciously, and trayterously, at sōdery places and tymes, with
the fathers, and Nonnes of Syon, and diuerse Monkes of the Charter
house of London and Shene, and with diuerse Freers Obseruauntes,
the places of Richemont, Grenewiche, and Cauntorbury, and to diuerse
other, bothe spirituall and temporall persones in greate nomber, to the
intent to sowe a secret murmor and grudge, in the hartes of the Kynges
subiectes, against the Maiestie of our souereigne lorde, and all his procedynges,
in thesaied diuorse and seperacion, intendyng therby to make
suche a diuision and rebellyng in this realme, emongest the kinges subiectes,
whereby the kynges highnes, should not onely haue been put to
peril of his life, but also in ieoperdy to be depriued from his croune and
dignitie royall.
                  
                     
And for a more playne and perticuler declaracion of the malicious
&amp; trayterous intentes of the sayd Elizabeth, Edward Bockyng, Ihon
Deryng, Hugh Ryche, Rychard Rysoy, &amp; Henry Golde, they concluded
by a confederacy among them selfes eche with other, to set forth in sermons
&amp; prechynges thesayd reuelacions to the people of this realme against
the kynges Maiestie, whensoeuer it should please y• sayd Elizabeth
to appoint them the tyme when they should so do, and agreed eche
with other secretely, and set forth thesayd false and fayned reuelacions
to their acquayntaunce and frendes in this realme, intendyng to make
a great multitude of people of this realme, by their secrete conspiracies,
in an aptnes to receiue and take suche their sermons and preachynges
which they intended to make, as is aforesayd, cōcernyng the premi
                        ••
                     es,
trayterously intēdyng therby to put our sayd souereigne lorde, not only
in peril of his life, but also in ieopardye of losse and depriuacion of his
croune and dignitie royal of this realme, frō him &amp; his lawfull succession
for euer. And in accomplishyng their false, trayterous, &amp; malicious
intentes against our sayd souereigne lorde, they caused the sayd Elizabeth,
at ii. tymes, secretely to declare thesayd false &amp; fayned reuelacions
to ii. of the Popes Orators and ambassadors at the Cities of Caūtorbury
and London. At whiche tyme the sayd Henry Golde tooke vpon
him to be interpretor therof, betwene thesayd Elizabeth &amp; thesayd Orators
named Anthony Pulleon: and the interpretor to the other Orator
named Syluester, was the foresayd Lawrence of Cauntorbury, to the
entent the kynges highnes, and all his procedynges in thesayd deuorce
and seperacion should be brought into an euil opinion with the Pope
and other princes and Potentates. And the sayd Hugh Ryche actually
trauailed to sondry places of this realme, and made secrete relacion of
the premisses concernyng the kynges highnes to diuers lordes bothe
spiritual and temporal, and diuers other persones lay and lerned, seculer
and religious. And the sayd Henry Gold ouer this, actually trauailed
and made relacion therof to thesayd lady Katheryne princes dowager,
to animate her to make commocion in this realme against our
sayd souereigne lorde, surmittyng that thesayd Elizabeth should haue
by reuelacion of God, that the sayd lady Katheryne should prosper &amp;
do well, and that her issue the lady Mary the kynges doughter should
prosper and reigne in this realme &amp; haue many frendes to sustaine and
maintayne her. And the sayd Elizabeth and Edward Bockyng, Ihon
Deryng &amp; Richard Master likewyse actually trauailed to diuers places
in this realme and made secrete relacion of thesayd false fayned hipocrysie
and reuelacions of thesayd Elizabeth &amp; gaue knowlege hereof
to dyuers other sondry persones of this realme.
                  All whiche conspiracies and confederacies of thesayd Elizabeth, and
other her complices aboue mencioned, was trayterously &amp; maliciously
deuised and practised by the sayd Elizabeth, Edward Bockyng, Ihon
Deryng, Rychard Master, Henry Golde, Hugh Ryche, and Rychard

Rysby to the entent trayterously to destroy our sayd souereigne lorde,
and to depriue him and his lawfull succession frō the croune &amp; dignitie
royall of this realme, whiche matter hath been practised and imagined
amongest them for the space of many yeres: whereof the whole circumstaunce
were very long to be written in this acte. And the sayd Ihon
Fysher bishop of Rochester and one Thomas Gold gentleman, and thesayd
Thomas Laurence, Edward Thwaytes, and Ihon Adeson chapelein
to thesayd Ihon bishop of Rochester, hauyng knowlege of the
false fained and dissimuled reuelacions, trayterously cōspired against
our sayd soueraigne lorde (as is aforesayd) did neuerthelesse make concelement
therof, and vttered not the same to our sayd souereigne lorde,
nor any his honorable counsail, against their dueties and allegeaunce
in that behalfe.
                  And furthermore, the sayd Thomas Gold, for the accomplishement
of his most trayterous intent, hath of late been a messenger frō thesayd
Elizabeth, sithen she was in warde in the Tower of London for thesayd
moste false and trayterous offences by her and her sayd complices committed
and done, he then beyng at libertie, by his message hath comforted
dyuerse others to stande stifly by her reuelacions, that they were of
God: notwithstādyng that she had confessed all her sayd falshed before
diuers of the kynges counsailours, and that they were manifestly proued,
found, and tryed moste false and vntrue: whiche thyng he did only
to raise and put sedicion and murmur in the people against the kynges
highnes, his croune and dignitie royal. And one Thomas Abel clerke
beyng of the confederacie aforesayd, and takyng suche 
                        •
                     irme &amp; constant
credite to thesayd fals and fayned reuelacions and miracles of thesayd
Nonne, not onely caused to be Printed and set forth in this realme dyuers
bookes against thesayd deuorce and separacion to the disslaunder
of our sayd souereigne lord, but also animated thesayd lady Katherine
obstinatly to persist in her wilful opinion against thesame deuorce and
separacion: and after thesayd deuorce lawfully had, to vsurpe and take
vpon her still to be quene, and procured diuers writynges to be made
by her, by the name of Quene: and also procured and abbetted the seruauntes
of thesayd Lady Katheryne against the kynges expresse commaundement
and proclamacion, to name, call, accept, &amp; repute thesayd
lady Katherine for quene of this realme to the intent to make a cōmon
diuision and rebellion in this realme to the great peril and daunger of
our sayd souereigne lorde.
                  Thus muche haue I recited vnto you out of the act as it is there expressed
worde for worde: now after foloweth the maner of her attainder
and of the other as in the act more at large doeth appeare. But to conclude
the xxi. day of April next folowyng she with other were drawen to
Tyborne and there executed as mooste iustly they had deserued as you
may perceiue by the premisses.
                  And at the place of execucion, and the present tyme that she suffered

she sayd these wordes,The wordes of Elizabeth Barton otherwyse call
                           •

                         death. 
                     hether am I come to dye, and I haue not been the
onely cause of myne owne death whiche moste iustly I haue deserued,
but also I am the cause of the death of all these persones whiche at this
tyme here suffre: &amp; yet to say the trueth, I am not somuche to be blamed
cōsideryng it was well knowen vnto these lerned men y• I was a poore
wenche without learnyng and therefore they might haue easely perceiued
that the thinges that were done by me could not procede in no suche
sorte, but their capacities and learnyng could right well iudge from
whence they proceded, and that they wer altogether fayned: but because
the thynges whiche I fayned was proffitable vnto them, therfore they
muche praised me and bare me in hande that it was the holy ghost and
not I that did theim, and then I beyng puft vp with their praises fell
into a certain pryde and folishe phantasie with my selfe and thought I
might fayne what I would, whiche thing hath brought me to this case,
and for the whiche now I cry God &amp; the kynges highnes most heartely
mercy, and desire all you good people to pray to God to haue mercy on
me and on all them that here suffre with me.
                  
                  In this parliament also was made the act of succession for the suertie
of the croune, to the whiche euery persone beyng of lawfull age should
be sworne vpon the payne expressed in that acte, as in thesame ye may
moste euidently see.
                  Monday the xxiii. day of Marche in the Parliament tyme, were solempnely
receiued into London as ambassadors from Iames the v.

                     turney, with diuers gentlemen on them attēdant
whiche were brought to the Taylers hall and there lodged. And
on the day of the Annunciācion of our Lady they were brought to the
kynges place at Westminster, where they shewed their commission and
message, for the whiche the kyng appointed them dayes to coūsail. And
shortly after commissioners were appointed as you shall heare.
                  Duryng the Parliament tyme, euery sonday preached at Paules crosse
a bishop, whiche declared the Pope not to be the head of the Churche.
                  The xxx. day of Marche the Parliament was proroged, and there
euery lorde and burges and all other, were sworne to the act of succession,
and subscribed their handes to a Parchement fixed to thesame othe.
This Parliament was proroged till the third day of Nouember next.
After this, commissions were sent ouer all England to take the othe of
all men and women to the act of succession, at whiche fewe repyned, except
doctor Ihon Fysher, sir Thomas Moore knight late lorde Chaū
                     celor,
and doctor Nicholas Wylson parson of saint Thomas Apostles
in London: wherfore these thre persones, after long exhortacion to them
made by the bishop of Cauntorbury at Lambeth, and expresse denyall
of them to be sworne, they were sent to the Tower where they remayned
and were oftentymes mocioned to be sworne: but the Bishoppe and sir

Thomas More sayd that thei had in their writynges written the princes
dowager Quene, and therfore they might not go against that, and
the doctor sayd that he in preachyng called her quene, whiche he would
not withsay, howbeit at length he was very wel contented, and dissembled
the matter and so escaped: But the other twayne stode against all

of Norffolke sat as iudge and high Steward of Englād.
The sayd lorde Dacres beyng brought to the barre with
the axe of the Tower before him, after his inditement red,
not only improued thesayd inditement as false and maliciously deuised
against him and answered euery part and matter therin contained, but
also so manly, wittily, and directly confuted his accusors whiche there
were ready to auouche their accusacions, that to their great shames, &amp;
to his great honor, he was found that day by his peres not giltie, whiche
vndoubtedly the commons excedyngly ioyed and reioy

had an excellent goodly witte, was brought out of the Tower where he
had been long, &amp; was there imprisoned for makyng of a booke against
Purgatory: but in the meane whyle that he was there, he was required
by one who heartely loued him and had a very good opinion in him, to
declare to him his faith and opinion in the Sacrament of the body and
bloud of Christ &amp; that he would put thesame in writyng, whiche thyng
he did. But after it chaūced that thesame persone whiche had this writyng
of Ihon Frith was acquainted with a Taylor in London called
Wyllyam Holt, whiche outwardely professed muche honestye, but inwardly
was a verye spye and a verye betrayer of as many menne as he
might bring in daungier. This Holt required after he had seen it, to
haue this writyng, &amp; he had it, and forthwith he presented it to sir Thomas
More then lorde Chaūcelor, and he immediatly made answere to
thesame in writyng, whiche also by the meanes of thesayd Holt, came to
the handes of Ihon Frith. Ihon Frith then perceiuyng that the thing
that he was so loth to write or meddle in (for it was a matter that none
could get him to talke of, sauyng suche that he as much trusted as him
selfe) was nowe so farre spred abroade that it was answered vnto, after
he had not a litle rebuked the negligence and folye of his frende whom
he trusted, stoode to the derence of his first treatise, and made a farther
declaracion of his mynde vpon thesame matter as appereth in a booke
whiche beareth his name. For the whiche opinion wt other he was after
diuers and sondry examinacions (aswell at Lambeth with the Bishop
of Cauntorbury as also at Croydon, and likewyse with the bishop of
Wynche
                     ••
                  er) brought vnto the Consistory in Paules Churche in London
before diuers bishoppes, where after muche disputyng, for that he
would not yelde nor submit himselfe to theim, they cōdempned him and

deliuered him to the seculer power to be brent as an heretike.
               At thesame tyme was one Andrew Hewet a very simple and vtterly
vnlerned yong mā a Taylor, whiche was also betrayed by the foresayd
Holt: This yong man beyng in like maner accused in the Consistory
before thesayd bishoppes for holding opinion against the Sacrament.
One of the bishoppes asked him how he beleued in the Sacrament? he
answered, he beleued therin as Master Frith did: why sayd they, doest
thou not beleue that it is ye very body of Christ really fleshe and bloud
euen as he was borne of the virgyn Mari? No sayd he, why so sayd the
bishop? because sayd he, that Christ byd me yt I should not beleue them
that say here is Christ and there is Christ, for 
                     •
                  alse Christes &amp; false prophetes
shal arise to deceiue you sayth Christ. Then certain of y• bishops
smyled, and doctor Stokesley then bishop of Lōdon sayd: Frith is an
heretike &amp; is cōdempned &amp; deliuered to the temporal power to be brent,
if thou wilt not submit thy selfe &amp; acknowlege thyne errour, thou shalt
likewise be condempned &amp; deliuered. I am content sayd he. Wylt thou
not abiure thyne heresie ꝙ the bishop? No sayd he, for I wil do as Master
Frith doth. Then we will condempne thee sayd ye bishop: do so sayd
he. And so they pronounced sentence on him, and deliuered him to the
Shiriffes: and from thence they were sent to Newgate where they remained
til the xxii. day of Iuly, &amp; that day were both brent at one s

                  ake
in Smythfelde. Where at thesame tyme one doctor Cooke which was
person of Hony Lane, &amp; one that was the Master of the Temple, willed
the people to pray no more for them then they would pray for dogges,
at whiche vncharitable wordes Frith smyled &amp; prayed God to forgeue
them, and the people sore grudged at them for so saiyng.
               The xiiii. day of August was a great fyer at Temple barre &amp; diuers
houses brent. And the xvi. day of thesame moneth was burned the kynges
stable at Charyng crosse otherwise called the Mowse, wherin was
brent many great Horses and great store of haye.
               In this yere the third day of Nouēber the kynges highnes helde his
high court of Parliament, in the whiche was cōcluded and made many
and sondry good, wholsome, and godly statutes: but among al one special
estatute, which aucthorised the kynges highnes to be supreme head
of the Churche of Englād, by the whiche the Pope with all his College
of Cardinalles with all their Pardons and Indulgences was vtterly
abholished out of this realme,The Pope abholished. God be euerlastyngly praysed therefore.
In this Parliament also was geuen to the kynges highnes the fyrst
frutes and tenthes of all dignities &amp; spiritual promocions. And in the
ende of the same Parliament the kynges Maiestie mooste graciously
graunted (and wylled it by thesame Parliament to be established) his
moste gracious and general free pardon.
               This yere also came in the great Admyrall of Fraunce: whiche Admyrall

was honorably receiued, and at his departyng was liberally
rewarded.
               In this tyme dyed the Erle of Kyldare prisoner in the Tower. And
euen at thesame tyme Thomas Fitzgarard his sonne begāne to rebell

Also he slewe the bishop of Deuelyn and brent and robbed all suche as
would not obeye him: But at the last he was apprehended and had as
he deserued as after shall appeare.

                  IN the beginnyng of this yere the duke of Norffolke and
the Bishop of Ely went to Caleys, and thether came the
Admyral of Fraunce. And the xix. day of Iune was thre
Monkes of the Charterhouse hanged, drawen, and quartred
at Tyborne and their quarters set vp aboute Lōdon
for deniyng the kyng to be supreme head of the Churche. Their names
were Exmewe, Myddlemore, and Nudigate. These men when they wer
arreigned at Westminster, behaued them selfes very stifly &amp; stubbornly
for hearyng their inditement red how trayterously they had spoken
against the kynges Maiestie his croune and dignitie, they neither blushed
nor bashed at it, but very folishly &amp; hipocritically knowleged their
treason whiche maliciously thei auouched, hauyng no lernyng for their
defēce, but rather beyng asked dyuers questions, thye vsed a malicious
silence, thinkyng as by their examinacions afterward in the Tower of
London it did appeare, for so they sayd, yt they thought those men which
was ye lorde Crumwel &amp; other that there satte vpon them in iudgement
to be heretiques and not of the Churche of God, and therfore not worthy
to be either aunswered or spoken vnto. And therfore as they deserued,
they receiued as you haue heard before.
               Also the xxii. day of thesame moneth Ihon Fysher bishop of Rochester
was beheaded, and his head set vpon London bridge.Ihon Fy

                      bishop of Rochester. This bishop
was of very many menne lamented, for he was reported to be a man of
great learnyng, and a man of very good life, but therin wonderfully
deceiued, for he maintained the Pope to be supreme head of ye Church,
and very maliciously refused the kynges tytle of supreme head. It was
sayd that the Pope, for that he helde so manfully with him and stoode
so stifly in his cause, did elect him a Cardinal, and sent the Cardinalles
hat as farre as Caleys, but the head it should haue stande on, was as
high as Lōdon bridge or euer the hat could come to Bishop Fysher, &amp;
then it was to late, and therfore he neither ware it nor enioyed his office.

This man as I sayd was accoumpted learned, yea, and that very nota

Barton that called herself the holy mayd of Kent, and no doubt
so was he in the defence of that vsurped authoritie, the more pitie: wonderful
it is that a man beyng lerned should be so blind in the scriptures
of God that proueth the supreme aucthoritie of princes so manyfestly.
Also the vi. day of Iulye was sir Thomas More beheaded for the likeSir Thomas

where on a blocke his head was striken from his shoulders and had no
more harme. I cannot tell whether I should call him a foolishe wyseman,
or a wise foolishman, for vndoubtedly he beside his learnyng, had
a great witte, but it was so myngled with tauntyng and mocking, that
it semed to them that best knew him, that he thought nothyng to be wel
spoken except he had ministred some mocke in the communicacion, insomuche
as at his commyng to the Tower, one of the officers demaūded
his vpper garment for his fee, meanyng his goune, and he answered, he

good woman haue pacience a litle while, for the kyng is so good vnto
me that euen within this halfe houre he will discharge me of all busynesses,
and helpe thee himselfe. Also when he went vp the stayer on
the Skaffolde, he desired one of the Shiriffes officers to geue him his
hand to helpe him vp, and sayd, when I come doune againe, let me shift

him forgeuenes of his death (as the maner is) to whom he sayd I
forgeue thee, but I promise thee that thou shalt neuer haue honestie of
the strykyng of my head, my necke is so short. Also euen when he shuld

out his beard and sayd to the hangmā, I pray you let me lay my beard

fyrst put it in Prynt, and likewise he translated the v. bookes of Moses,
Iosua, Iudicum, Ruth, the bookes of the Kynges and the bookes
of Paralipomenon, Nehemias or the fyrst of Esoras, the Prophet Ionas,
&amp; nomore of ye holy scripture. He made also diuers treatises, which
of many were well lyked and highly praysed, and of many vtterly dispised
and abhorred, and especially of the moste part of the bishoppes of
this realme, who often by their great labours caused Proclamacions
to be made against his bookes, and gatte them condempned and brent,
aswell the Newe testament as other woorkes of his doynges. Suche
as best knewe him reported him to be a very sobre man, borne vpon the
borders of Wales, and brought vp in the Uniuersitie of Oxforde, and
in life and conuersacion vnreprouable: and at the last beyng in Oxford
Luther then settyng foorth certaine woorkes against the Byshop
of Rome, Tyndale occasioned by theim to searche the scriptures whether
Luther sayd the trueth or no, did therby not onely himselfe attaine
the knowlege of the vsurped aucthoritie of the bishop of Rome, and his
supersticious and dampnable doctrynes that he had taught and published
through all Christendome, but also lamentyng the ignoraunt
state that his natiue countrey of England was in, who altogether were
wrapped in errours thought it his dutie, for that God had reueled
the light of his Gospell to him, to bestowe his talent to the honour of
God and proffite of his countrey, and thought no waye so good to
reduce the people from their errour as fyrst to make theim acquaynted
with Goddes woorde, that they might knowe what Goddes will
was that we should do, and what the bishoppe of Rome sayd that we
must do: and therefore fyrst as is aforesayd, he translated into Englishe
the Newe testament, a woorke no doubt very notable and to
him verye paynefull, for that he was forced to flye his owne natiue
countrey, and to lyue in a straunge lande among people that as well
varyed from his maners, as the persones to him were vnknowen.

by one Philippes an Englisheman and then a scholar at Louayn, betrayed
and taken, and as many sayd, not without the helpe and procurement
of some bishoppes of this realme: but true it is, that after he
had been in prison more then a yere &amp; almost forgotten, he was labored
for by letters written by the lorde Cromwell, &amp; then in all hast because
he would recāt no part of his doynges, was burned as you haue hea

that their great Monasteries should haue continued still: But euen at

hauyng not aboue vi. persons with him, and came
in the euenyng frō Grenewyche to his place at Westminster.

Also at thesame tyme was likewyse apprehended, the lorde

Smeton, Wyllyam a Bruton and sir Fraunces Weston, all of the
kynges priuy chamber. All these wer likewise committed to the Tower
and after arreigned and condempned of high treason. And all the
gentlemen were beheaded on the Skaffolde at the Tower hyll: But
the Quene was with a sworde beheaded within the Tower. And these
folowyng were the woordes that she spake the day of her death whiche
was the xix. day of May. 1536.

pray God saue the kyng and sende him long to reigne ouer you, for a
gentler nor a more mercyfull prince was there neuer: and to me he was
euer a good, a gentle, &amp; soueraigne lorde. And if any persone will medle

the realme helde a solempne conuocacion at Paules churche in Lōdon
where after much disputacion and debatyng of matters thei published
a booke of religion intitled, Articles deuised by the kinges highnes &amp;c.
In this booke is specially mencioned but iii. Sacramentes, with the
whiche the Lyncolneshyremen (I meane their ignoraunt priestes) were
offended, and of that occasion depraued the kynges doynges. And this
was their first beginnyng, as after ye shall plainly heare.
               After this booke whiche passed by the kynges aucthoritie with the cō
                  sent
of the Clergie, was published, the whiche cōtained certaine articles
of religion necessary to be taught vnto the people, and among other it
specially treated of nomore then thre Sacramentes, where alwaies the
people had been taught vii. Sacramentes, &amp; beside this booke, certain
Iniunccions were that tyme geuen wherby a nōber of their holy dayes
was abrogated &amp; specially suche as fell in the haruest tyme, the keping
of whiche was muche to the hinderaunce of the gatheryng in of corne,
haye, fruite, and other suche like necessary and profitable commodities.

of the North partes beyng at that tyme very ignoraunt and
rude, knowyng not what true religion meant, but altogether noseled in
supersticion and popery, and also by the meanes of certayne Abbottes
and ignorant priestes not a litle stirred and prouoked for the suppression
of certain Monasteries, and for the extirpacion and a

see frendes nowe is taken from vs fower of the vii. Sacramentes and
shortly ye shall lese the other thre also, &amp; thus the fayth of holy churche
shall vtterly be suppressed and abholished: and therefore sodainly they
spred abrode and raysed great and shamefull slaunders onely to moue
the people to sedicion and rebellion, and to kyndle in the people hateful
and malicious myndes against the kynges Maiestie and the Magestrates
of the realme, saiyng let vs fully bend our selues to the mayntenaunce
of religion, and rather then to suffre it thus to decay euen to
dye in the felde. And amongest theim also were to many euen of the
nobilitie that did not a lytle prouoke and stirre vp the ignoraunt and
rude people the more stifly to rebell and stand therin, faythfully promisyng
theim bothe ayde and succour against the kyng and their owne
natyue country (like foolishe and wicked menne) thynkyng by their so
doyng to haue done God high pleasor and seruice. There were also
certaine other malicious and busye persones who added Oyle (as the
Adage sayeth) to the Fornace: These made open clamours in euery
place where oportunitie serued, that Christian religion should be vtterly
violate, dispised and set asyde, and that rather then so, it behoued
and was the partes of euery true Christen manue to defende it euen to
the death, and not to admit and suffre by any meanes the fayth (in the
whiche their forefathers so long and so many thousande yeres haue lyued
and continued) nowe to be subuerted and destroyed. Among these
were many priestes whiche deceiued also the people with many false
fables and venemous lyes and ymaginacions (whiche could neuer entre
nor take place in the heart of any good man, nor faythfull subiect)
saiyng that al maner of praier and fastyng &amp; all Goddes seruice should
vtterly be destroyed and taken away, that no man should mary a wyfe
or be partaker of the Sacramentes, or at length should eate a piece of

somme of money, &amp; that they should be brought in more bondage &amp; in a
more wicked maner of life, then the Sarazins be vnder y• great Turke.
with these and suche other like errours and slaunderous tales, the people
thus instructed (or as I may trulier speake) deceiued and mocked,
beyng to light or credite, incotinent to the helpe and maintenaunce of
religion once established and confirmed, they stifly and stoutly did cō
                  spire
and agree: and in a part of Lincolneshire, first thei assembled and
shortly after, ioyned into an Army, beyng (as it was supposed) of men

apte and feete for the warre, in nombre aboute twentie thousand.
               Against these trayterous rebelles, with all the haste and spede that
might be (after he harde thereof) the kynges toyal maiestie, in his awne
proper persone, furnished with a goodly and warlike Armie, lackyng
nothyng that to suche a company 
                     ••
                  oulde appertein, marched towarde
them. But these rebelles hearyng that his maiestie was present with
his power and armie royall, feared what woulde folow of this matter,
and suche as were noble men and Gentlemen, that before fauored them
began to withdrawe them selues, so that thei wer destitute of Capitaines:
and at the last thei in writyng made certayn peticions to the kynges
maiestie, professyng that thei neuer entended hurte toward his royall
persone. The kynges maiestie receiued there peticions, and made an
swere vnto them as foloweth.
               First we begyn and make answere to the foure and sixe articles, because
vpon theim dependeth muche of the rest.The kynges answer to the rebelles. Concernyng cho

                  yng
of counsaylors, I neuer haue red, hard, nor knowne, that princes counsailors
and prelates, should be appoynted by rude and ignoraunt common
people, nor that thei wer persones mete, nor of habilitie to, discerne
&amp; chose mete &amp; sufficiēt coūsailors for a prince: how presumpteous then
are ye the rude commons of one shire, and that one of the moste brute &amp;
beastly of the whole realme, &amp; of the least experience, to fynd faute with
your Prince for the electyng of his counsaylours and prelates, and to
take vpon you contrarie to godes lawe and mannes lawe to rule your
prince, whome ye are bounde by all lawes to obey and serue with both
youre lyues, landes and goodes, and for no worldly cause to withstād?
the contrarie wherof you like traytors and rebelles haue attempted &amp;
not like true subiectes as ye name youre selfes.
               As to the suppression of religious houses and monastaries, we wolle
that ye and all oure subiectes should well knowe that this is graunted
vs by all the nobles spirituall and temporall, of this oure Realme, and
by all the commons in thesame by acte of Parliament, and not set furth
by any counsailor or counsaylors vpon there mere will and fantasie, as
ye full falsely would perswade oure realme to beleue.
               And where ye allege that the seruice of god is muche diminished, the
trouth therof is contrarie, for there be no houses suppressed where god
was well serued, but where most vice, mischief and abhominacion of liuyng
was vsed, and that doth wel apere by there awne confessions subcribed
with ther awne handes in the tyme of their visitacions, &amp; yet wee
suffered a great many of them (more then we neded by the acte) to stand
wherin if thei amend not ther liuyng, we feare, we haue more to answer
for, then for the suppression of al the rest. And as for the hospitalitie for
the relief of the pore, we wonder ye be not ashamed to affirme that thei
haue bene a great releief of pore people, whan a great many or the most
parte hath not past foure of fiue religious persons in them, and diuers
but one which spēt the substaunce of the goodes of ther houses in norishyng

of vice and abhominable liuyng. Now what vnkyndnes and
vnnaturalitie may we impute to you and all oure subiectes that be of
that mynde, that had leauer suche an vnthriftie sorte of vicious persones,
shoulde enioy suche possessions, profites and Emolumentes, as
growe of thesaied houses, to the maintenaunce of there vnthriftie life,
then wee youre naturall prince, souereigne lorde and kyng, which doth
and hath spent more in youre defences of our awne, then sixe times thei
be woorth? As touchyng the acte of vses, we maruaile what madnes
is in youre brayne, or vpon what grounde ye woulde take aucthoritie
vpon you to cause vs to breake these lawes and statutes, which by
all the nobles knightes and gentlemen of this realme (whome thesame
chiefly toucheth) hath bene graunted and assented to: seyng in no maner
of thynges it toucheth you the basse commons of our Realme.
               Also the groundes of all those vses wer false, &amp; neuer admitted by any
lawe: but vsurped vpon the prince, contrarie to all equitie and iustice, as
it hath ben openlie both disputed &amp; declared by al the well learned men
in the Realme of Englande in Westminster hall: whereby ye may well
perceiue how mad and vnreasonable your demaundes be, both in that
and in the rest, and how v

                  mete it is for vs and dishonorable, to graūt
or assēt vnto, and lesse mete and decent for you in such a rebellious sorte
to demaunde thesame of your prince.
               As touchyng the fiftene which ye demaūd of vs to be released, think
ye that we be so faintharted, that perforce ye of one shire (wer ye a great
many mo) coulde compell vs with youre insurrections and suche rebelleous
demeanor to remit thesame? or thinke ye that any man wil or may
take you to be true subiectes, that first make and shewe a louyng graūt
and then perforce woulde compell youre souereigne lorde and kyng to
release thesame? the tyme of paiment whereof is not yet come, ye, and seyng
thesame will not coūtreuaile the tēth peny of the charges, which we
do &amp; daily sustein for your tuicion &amp; safegarde: make you sure, by your
occasiōs of these your ingratitudes, vnnaturallnes &amp; vnkindnes to vs
now administred, ye geue vs cause whiche hath alwaies bene asmuche
dedicate to your wealth as euer was kyng, not somuche to set or studie
for the settyng forwarde of the same, seyng how vnkyndly and vntruly
ye deale now with vs, without any cause or occasion: and doubt ye not,
though you haue no grace nor naturallnes in you to consider your dutie
of allegiaunce to youre kyng, and souereigne Lorde, the rest of oure
Realme we doubt not hath: and we and thei shall so loke on this cause,
that we truste it shalbe to your confusion, if accordyng to youre former
letters you submit not youre selfes.
               As touching the first frutes, we let you wit, it is a thing graunted vs
by act of parliament also, for the supportacion of parte of the great and
excessiue charges, whiche wee supporte and beare for the maintenaunce
of youre wealthes and other oure subiectes: and wee haue knowen also

that ye our commons haue much complayned in tymes passed, that the
moste parte of our gooddes, landes and possessions, o
                     •
                   the realme, were
in the spirituall mennes handes: &amp; yet bearyng vs in hand that ye be as
louyng subiectes to vs as may be, ye cannot fynd in your hartes that
your prince and souereigne lorde shoulde haue any parte thereof (and
yet it is nothyng preiudiciall vnto you our commons) but to rebel and
vnlaufully rise agaynst youre prince, contrary to the duetie of allegeaunce
and goddes commaundement, Si
                     •
                  s, remembre youre folies and
treiterous demeanours, &amp; shame not your natiue countrey of England
nor offend no more so greueously youre vndoubted kyng and naturall

                   most louyng vnto you, and
remembre your duetie of allegiaunce, and that ye are bound to obey vs
youre kyng, both by goddes commaundement and law of nature.
               Wherfore wee charge you eftsones vpon the forsaied bondes and paynes,
that ye withdraw your selfes to your awne houses, eue

and to cause the prouokers of you to this mischief, to be deliuered to

to suche condigne ponishment as wee and oure nobles shall thinke you

mightie god, to geue you grace to do your duties, to vse your selfes towardes
vs like trew and faithfull subiectes, so as we may haue cause,
to ordre you thereafter, and rather obediently to consent amongest you
to deliuer into hādes of our liuetenaunte a hundreth persones, to be
ordered accordyng to their demerites, at our will and pleasure, then by
your obstinacie and wilfulnes, to put your selfes, your wiues, children,
landes, goodes and cattalles, besides the indignacion of god, in the vtter
aduenture of totall destruction, and vtter ruine, by force and violence
of the swerd.
               After the Lincolneshire men had receiued this the kynges answer aforsaied,
made to their peticiōs, eche mistrustyng other who shoulde bee

vpon him as capitain of this rowte, named him selfe capitain Cobler,
but it was a Monke called Doctor Makerel, with diuerse other which
afterward were taken and executed.
               All these thynges thus ended, the contrey appeased, and all thinges

in quiet the kynges maiestie retired, and brake vp his army,

yorkeshire: And these men had eche of theim to other bound them selfes
by their othe to be faithfull and obedient to his capitaine: thei also declared by their proclamaciōs solemply made, that this their insurreccion,
should extend no farther but only to the maintenaunce and defence
of the faith of Christe and deliueraunce of holy Churche sore decaied &amp;
oppressed, and also for the furtheraūce aswel of priuate as publik matters

was painted Christ hāgyng on the Crosse on the one side, and a chalice
with a paynted kake in it on the other side with diuerse other banners
of like hipocresie and fained sanctitie: the souldiars also had a certain
cognisaunce or badge, embroudered or set vpon the sleues of there
coates which was the similitude of the fiue woundes of Christ, and in
the middest thereof was written the name of our lorde, and thys the rebellious
Guarrison of Sathan with his false and coūterfeated signes
of holines set foorth and decked thē selues, only to delude and deceiue
the symple and ignoraunt people.
               After that the kynges highnes was credebly certefied of this new in
surged insurrection, he makyng no delay in so weightie a matter, caused
with al spede the Dukes of Norffolke &amp; Suffolke, the Marques of

               The third day of Februarie was Thomas Fitz Garrad late Erle of
of Kildare and fiue of his vncles drawen, hanged, and quartered at Tiborne,
for high treason.
               Also in thesaied moneth, Nichol Musgraue, Thomas Tylbie, withe
other began a newe rebellion at Kirbie Staphā in Westmerland, with
eight thousand persones, and beseged the Citie of Carlile, from whence
thei were beaten, with the only power of the citie, and in their returning
the Duke of Norffolke who then was made liuetenaunt of the North,
encountred with them and toke the Capitanes, &amp; accordyng to the lawe
marciall, arreigned threscore and fourtene of them, and hāged them on

which apperteigneth to rebelles: suche are men when god leaueth them
to them selues, and when thei will entreprise the doyng of that thyng
which Goddes most holy woord vtterly forbiddeth. This Bigod was
apprehended and brought to the Tower of London: this last rebellion
began in Setrington, and in Pikeryn Leigh, and Scarborough.

commō people it was called the act of sixe articles, &amp; of some it was named
the whip withe sixe. strynges, and of some other and that of the
moste parte, it was named the bloudy statute, for of truth it so in shorte
time after skourged a great nombre in the citie of Londō, wher the first
quest for the inquirie of the offendors of the saied statute sat at a church
called Beckets house, now named the Mercers Chappel, that the saied

quest beyng of purpose selected and picked out emong all the rest of the
inhabitauntes of the citie, that none might thereof be admitted which either
had red any part of the holy scripture in English,The first quest that inquired of the sixe Articles, or in any wise fauoured
suche as either had red it, or loued the preachers of it: insomuch
as this quest was so zelous &amp; feruent in the execuciō of this statute, that
thei among them selues thought it not only sufficiēt to inquire of the offendors
of the saied statute, but also by ther fine wittes &amp; willyng mindes,
thei inuented to inquire of certayn braunches of thesame statute
as thei termed it, which was not only to inquire who spake again masses,
but who thei wer that seldome came vnto them: and also not only
who denyed the Sacramente to be Christes very naturall body, but al
so who helde not vp their handes at sacryng tyme, and knocked not on
there brestes: And thei not only inquired who offended in the sixe articles,
but also who came seldome to the churche, who toke no holy bread
nor holy water, who red the Bible in the churche, or in communicacion
contemned priestes, or Images in the Churches. &amp;c. with a great nombre

had spoken against the supremacie of the bishop of Rome, but he was
wrapped in the sixe articles, insomuche as thei indited and presented of
suspicion to the nombre of fiue hundred persones and aboue: so that if
the kynges maiestie had not graunted his pardon, for that by the good

had accused any and auouched that thei had spoken agaynst the sacramēt,
ther was then no way but death, for it boted not to confesse that his

faithfull frendes y• the cākerd &amp; cruel serpēt the bishop of rome, by that
Archetraitor Reignold Poole, enemie to godes worde and his natural
contrey▪ had moued and stirred diuerse great princes and potentates of
Christendome to inuade the Realme of England, and vtterlie to destroy
the whole nacion of thesame: Wherefore his Maiestie in his awne

persone, without any deley tooke very laborious and payuefull iourneyes
towardes the sea coastes. Also he sent dyuers of his nobles and
counsaylours to view and searche all the Portes and daungers on the
coastes where any meete or conuenient landyng place myght be supposed,
aswell on the borders of Englande as also of Wales. And in all

Admirall Erle of Southampton to prepayre in redynesse Shippes
for the sea, to his great coast and charges.
               And besyde this, to haue all his people in a redynesse, he directed his
Commissions thorough out the Realme to haue his people mustered, &amp;
the harneyes &amp; weapons seene and viewed, to thentent that all thynges
shoulde be in a redynesse if his enemyes woulde make any attempte in
to this Realme: And amongest other, one Commission was directed to

men of the Citie repayred to their wardes, and there by the othe of the
Common Counsayll &amp; Constables of the same warde tooke the nombre
of the men, harnesses and weapons, accordynge to their Commission.
And after that they had well viewed their Bookes and the nombre of
the persones, they thought it not expedient to admyt the whole nombre
of soche as were certefied for able and apte persones for the Muster:
Wherefore then they assembled theym selfes agayne and chose out the
most able persones and put by thother, and specially all soche as had
no harnesse, nor for whome no harnesse coulde be prouyded. But when
they were credebly aduertysed by the Kynges Counsellor Thomas
Lorde Cromewell Knyght of the Noble Ordre of the Gartier Lorde
Preuye Seale (to whose prudence and goodnesse the Citie was moche
bounden) that the Kyng hym selfe woulde see the people of the Citie
Muster in a conuenient nombre, and not to set furthe all their power,
but to leaue some at home to keepe the Citie. Then eftsones euery Alderman
repayred to his warde,The great Muster in London. and there put a syde all soche as hadde
Iackes, coates of plate, coates of mayle and bryganders, and appoynted
none but soche as had whyte Harnesse, excepte soch as should beare
Morysh Pykes, which had no harnesse but skulles: and they appoynted
none but soche as had whyte harnesse, neither dyd they admyt any
that was a Straunger, although they were Denyzens. When it was
knowen that the King would see the Muster, lorde how glad the people
were to prepare, and what desyre they had to do their Prince seruyce, it
would haue made any faythfull subiectes herte to haue reioysed. Then
euery man beyng of any substaūce prouyded hymself a coate of whyte
sylke, and garnyshed their bassenetes with turues lyke cappes of sylke

set with ouches, furnished with chaines of gold &amp; fethers: other gylted

new gate house at his Palace at Westmynster where he viewed all the
whole company: In lyke maner passed the second &amp; third battels al wel

ix. of the clocke in the mornīg by the lytle conduite entryng into Pauls
churchyarde, &amp; so directly to Westmynster, &amp; so thorough the sanctuary
and rounde about the parke of s. Iames, &amp; so vp into the felde &amp; came

the lytle conduyte, the last of the Muster entered Pauls churchyarde,
which then was .iiii. of the clocke at after noone. The nombre was .xv.
thousande, besyde Wyffelers and other wayters.
                  In this yere about the Feast of s. Ihon Baptist,Insurrection in Gaunt. the cōmon people of
the town of Gaunt in Flaūders, began to grudge against the Officers
of the Emperour &amp; thoccasion was this: The cōmon people being supported
of dyuers ryche Merchauntes of the towne, complained that the
Excyse of the Wyne was so great, that they payed of euery pottell .ii.d
for thexcise that they solde by retaile, besyde the price of the wyne, &amp; likewyse
payed the Merchauntes which solde it in great: and yet that more
greued them that the Abbots, Friers, Chanons &amp; other Religious persones
&amp; men of the Church (of the whiche was grer store in that towne)
the which among them had the greatest ryches &amp; wealth of that towne,
shoulde be exempt &amp; dronke Wyne free without paiyng Excise, whych
thyng turned to the charges of other, and therwith the cōmons founde
them selues sore greued, aud sayde that they were oppressed contrarye
to their olde and auncieut Priuileges. The Rulers made promise that
an ordre &amp; way shoulde be taken therin, but they desyred respyte that
thei might know the mynd of the Queene of Hungary, Regent for the
Emperoure of the lowe countrey, whyche Quene at that tyme was at
Bruxell, and euen then was goyng to vset the countrey of Holand.
The Queene consented to nothyng that the commons desyred, but sent
them a very cruell and frowarde answere not without great threates,
that if they woulde not euery man quietly remayne in their houses, and

pay their excyse as they had ben accustomed to do, they should lyke rebels
as thei wer be forced thervnto whether thei would or not: wherfore
the Cōmons assembled, &amp; when they had well digested the answer of the
Quene, they determined to seke another meanes, &amp; fyrst they assembled
themselues into a battel to the nōbre of .x. or .xii.M. wel armed mē, night
and day watching &amp; warding the towue, in such sorte that themperours
Officers bare no rule: &amp; he whom they called the chiefe Bailyf or Gouernour
of the towne durst not once shew his face amomgest them, but
by the helpe of a boy he cōueied himself by a Postern &amp; so got out of the
towne. The people of Gaunt perceiuyng their Rulers thus departed,
the chie
                        •
                     est of them that wer in the towne condiscēded &amp; agreed to write
vnto the Frenche Kyng for ayde, &amp; caused a Gentlemen of their towne
to deuyse a Letter, for the whiche a
                        •
                     terwarde he lost his head.
                  The sute and request of the sayde men of Gaunt was, that it would
please the Frenche Kyng to sende vnto theim men &amp; municions, and to
succour them as the auncient subiectes to the Crowne of Fraunce, and
to delyuer them from the bondage that they were in, &amp; to remoue from
them the great Exactions &amp; imposicions, that the Officers of the sayde
Emperour had oppressed them with all, and they woulde yelde &amp; delyuer
all vnto him as to their Soueraigne Lord, &amp; in lyke maner would
other townes to them adioynynge do. And for a truth (sayth the writer
of the Annales of A
                        •
                     quytayn) if the Frenche Kyng woulde haue herkened
vnto their request &amp; sute, it had ben an easye thyng for him both
to haue enioyed the possession of the greatest nombre of all the townes
in the lowe countrey: as Flaunders, Arthoys and the rest of that countrey,
&amp; also to haue put the Emperour in great hazarde. But the Frenche
Kyng wyllyng to kepe and holde the Truce which was concluded and
sworne, hauyng a greater respect to his 
                        •
                     ayth and promyse then to his
profite &amp; gayne, thinkyng that if he should consent to the request of the
Gauntoys, he should begyn a new Warre to the noiaunce of the cōmen
people of Christendome, wherfore he refused vtterly either to ayde or
succour them.
                  The Queene of Hungarye thynkynge to haue pacifyed all this rumor,
sent vnto the Towne of Gaunte her ryght trustye and valyaunt
Knyght, the Lorde of Sempy, of the House of Crouy, accompanyed
with the Lorde Lyquerque and one of her Preuy Councell: but these
men amongest the cōmons wer not so well entertained as they thought
they shoulde haue ben, and therfore taryed not longe amongest them,
but were glad to conuey them selues from them in dissimuled apparell.
                  The Emperoure beynge aduertysed of all this busynesse, and perceiuyng
his lowe countrey by the reason of sedicion was in daunger,
deuised meanes how he might come to them, for thā he was in Spayn.
He thought he woulde not hazarde hymselfe vpon the sea: and he durst
not trust the Almaynes, because he had broken promyse with theim so
o
                        ••
                     en concernynge their Generall Councell that he promysed to haue

assembled: wherfore he determyned to moue the Frenche Kyng and to
sue for a safeconduyte to passe thorough Fraunce, whiche very gladly
the Frenche Kyng graunted hym, insomuch that after the French kyng
knew of his desyre, both he and the Dolphyn entreted most hertely the
Emperour to passe that way, trustyng therby that it sho
                        •
                     lde haue ben
an occasyon of peace betwene them.
                  All thynges meete for themperours assuraunce was so appoynted by
the Constable of Fraūce, that the Emperour departed out of Spayn, &amp;
came to Bayon, frō thence to Burdeaux &amp; so to Poyters: after he came
to Loches where he met with the French kyng &amp; the Quene, &amp; then thei
together passed frō thence to Orleaunce, &amp; so to Paris, into which Citie
they entered the fyrst day of Ianuary in the yere of our Lorde a 1539.
and so from thence after great chere &amp; royall enterteynment he passed
thorough the lower coūtreys, &amp; at last came to Bruxelles in Braband.
                  And fyrst the Emperour vnder colour to haue pytie &amp; to remedye the
poore cōmons of Gaūt, &amp; saiyng that he wold not only pardō their offē
                     ces,
but also he could not blame them being oppressed to complayn, &amp; by
this meanes he obteined licence that the County of Reux accōpanyed wt
ii.C. men of Armes &amp; .v.M. Launceknightes entered the towne, saiyng
to thinhabitantes that this power was only to kepe the towne in peace
&amp; quyet tyll a good &amp; profitable ordre shoud be taken for the Cōmons,
The poore inhabitantz beleuīg al that was promised &amp; said vnto them
&amp; mistrustyng nothyng, threw of their harnesse, &amp; euery man peaceably
went to their houses. Then entered into the towne themperour accompanyed
with his brother the kyng of Hongary, &amp; his syster the Quene
Dowager of Hongary, the Duke of Sauoy and many other Princes,
Lordes and Gentlemen, and a great power of men of warre, whyche
entery was about Mydsomer, in the yere a▪ M.v.C.xl.
                  Themperour beyng in Gaunt &amp; hauyng thupper hand of them, that
is to say, beyng stronger within the towne then thinhabitantes wer, in
the place of his gret pytie that he semed to haue on the poore inhabitātz
at his fyrst entery, he immediatly began to do execucion, &amp; that of a gret
nombre of them, and without all mercy executed them, insomuch that among
all other, the Gentlemen which the Cōmons enforced to wryte the
letter to the Frēch kīg was beheded, as before is expressed: &amp; afterward
themperour caused an Abbey of s. Banon to be suppressed, &amp; in the same
place at the charges of the Gauntois, he made a Castell of a meruelous
largenesse, for it was .ix.C. foote long, &amp; .viii.C. large: &amp; not contented
with suche as he put to death, but also of a great nombre he confiscated
ther landes and goodes, and finally he brake all their Priuileges and
Ordinaunces, and lefte the poore inhabitantes of Gaunt in a miserable
case: But now to returne to thaffayres of England.

                  When the Kyng knew that she was arriued in her tent, he with al diligence
set out thorough the parke. And fyrst issued the Kynges Trompettes,
then the Kynges Officers beyng sworne of his Councell, nexte

to beholde, yet his Princely countenaunce, his goodly personage and
royall gesture so farre exceded all other creatures beyng present, that in
comparyson of his persone, all his ryche apparell was lytle estemed.
After him folowed his lord Chaūberlein, thā came sir Anthony Browne
master of his horse, a goodly gētleman &amp; a comly personage, wel horsed
trapped &amp; rychely apparelled, leadyng the Kynges horse of estate by a
long reyne of golde, whyche horse was trapped in maner lyke a barde

the ranke where the Speares or Pencyoners stoode: and there euery
persone that came with the Kyng placed hymselfe on the one syde or the
other, the Kyng standyng in the myddes.
                  When her Grace was aduertysed of the Kynges cōmyng, she issued

made rounde without any trayne after the Dutche fassyon, and on

Perle of a very propre fassyon, &amp; before that she had a cornet of blacke

glystered all the felde. And at the dore of the Tente she mounted on a

                     ayre horse richely trapped, with her fotemen about her in goldsmithes
worke enbrodered with the blacke Lion, &amp; on his shoulder a Carbuncle
golde, and so she marched towarde the Kyng: whych perceiuyng her to
approche came forwarde somewhat beyonde the crosse on Blacke Heth,
and there paused a lytle in a fayre place tyll she came nerer: then he put
of his bonnet &amp; came foreward to her, &amp; with most louely countenaūce
and Princely behauyour saluted, welcomed &amp; enbrased her to the great
reioysyng of the beholders: and she lykewyse not forgettyng her duty,
with most amiable aspecte &amp; womanly behauyour receyued his Grace
with many sweete woordes and great thankes and praisynges geuen
to hym. And whyle they two were thus communynge, the fyftye Pencioners
and the Garde departed to furnysh the Courte and Halle of
Grenewyche. And when the Kyng had talked with her a lytle whyle,
he put her on his ryght hande, and so with their footemen they rode as
though thei had ben coupeled together, O what a syght was this to see
so goodly a Prince &amp; so noble a Kyng to ryde with so fayre a Lady of so
goodly a stature &amp; so womanly a countenance, &amp; in especiall of so good
qualyties, I thynke no creature could see them but his herte reioysed.
                  Now when the Kyng and she were mette and bothe their companyes
ioyned together, they returned thorough the rankes of Knyghtes and
Esquyers which stoode styl all this whyle &amp; remoued not, in this ordre:
Fyrst her Trompettes went forwarde, whyche were twelue in nombre

then Dukes and the Archbysshop of Caunterbury and Duke Phillip
of Bauire, nexte followed the Ambassadors, then the Lorde Preuye
Seale and the Lorde Chauncellor, then the Lorde Marques with the
Kynges sworde, nexte followed the Kyng himselfe equally ridyng with
his faire Lady, &amp; behind him rode for Anthony Browne with the kyngz
horse of Estate as you hearde before, and behynde her rode syr Iohan
Dudley Maister of her horses leadynge her spare Palferaye trapped

or Pages of Honoure, then followed the Ladye Margarete Doglas,
the Ladye Marques Dorset, the Dutches of Richmond &amp; Suffolke,
and Countesses of Rutland &amp; Hertforde, &amp; other Countesses: then
followed her Graces Chariot in the which she rode all her iourney, well
carued &amp; gylte with Armes of her coūtrey curiously wrought &amp; couered

with cloth of golde, all the horses were trapped with blacke veluet, &amp;
on them rode Pages of Honor in coates of veluet, in the whiche Charyot
rode .ii. auncient Ladyes of her countrey: nexte after the Chariot
followed, vi. Ladyes &amp; Gentlewomen of her countrey all richely apparelled
with cappes set with Perle, &amp; great Chaynes of dyuers fassyons
after the vsage of their countrey, which were very fayre of face, &amp; with
them rode .vi. Ladies of England well besene. Then followed another
Charyot lykewyse gylte &amp; furnyshed as thother was: after that Charyot
followed .x. Englysh Ladyes well apparelled, nexte them another
Chariot al couered with blacke cloth, &amp; in that .iiii. gentlewomen which
were her Graces Chamberers: then followed all the remnaunt of the
Ladyes, Gentlewomen &amp; Maydens in a gret nombre of which dyd weare
that day Frenche whodes: last of all came another Chariot all blacke
with .iii. Launders appertaynyng to her Grace: nexte after followed a
Horselytter of cloth of golde &amp; Crymosyn veluyt vpon veluet paled,
with horses trapped accordīgly which the king sent her, Then followed
the seruyng men of her trayne, all clothed in blacke &amp; on great horses.
                  In this ordre thei rode thorough the rankes, &amp; so thorough the parke
and at the late Freers walle all men alyghted sauyng the Kyng, the .ii.
Maisters of the Horses &amp; the Henxmen whych rode to the halle dore, &amp;
the Ladyes rode to the Courte gate. And as they passed they behelde
on the wharfe howe the Citizens of London were rowyng vp &amp; downe
on the Thames euen before them, euery crafte in his Barge garnyshed
with Banners, Flagges, Stremers, Pencelles and Targettes, some
paynted &amp; beaten with the Kynges Armes, some with her Graces Armes,
and some with the Armes of their Crafte or Mistery. Besyde the
Barges of euery crafte, there was a Barge made lyke a ship, called the
Batchelers barke, decked with cloth of gold, penons, pencels, &amp; targetz
in great nombre, on whō wayted a Foyst that shot great peces of Artillary.
And in euery barge was dyuers sortes of Instrumentes &amp; chyldrē
&amp; men syngyng, which sang &amp; plaied altogether as the King &amp; the Lady
passed on the wharfe, which syght &amp; noies they much praised &amp; allowed.
                  When the Kyng &amp; she wer within the vtter courte, they alygted from
their horses, &amp; the Kyng louyngly embrased her &amp; kyssed her, byddyng
her welcome to her owne, &amp; led her by her lyfte arme thorough the halle
which was furnyshed beneth the harth with the Kynges Garde, and aboue
the harth with the fyftye Pencioners with their Batell Axes, &amp; so
brought her vp to her preuy chaumbre, where he lefte her for that tyme.
                  And assone as the Kyng &amp; she was entered the Courte, was shot out
of the Tower of Grenewyche &amp; there about, a great peale of Gonnes.
                  When the Kynges company and hers was entered the parke, as
you haue hearde, then all the horse men on Blacke Heath brake their aray
and had lycence to departe to London, or to their lodgyng. To se
howe longe it was or the horsemen coulde passe, and howe late it was in
the nyght yer the footemen coulde get ouer London brydge, I assure
you it was wonderous to beholde. the nombre was so great. Thus
                  
                     This the Noble Lady remayned vnmaryed vntyll the tuysday followyng
beyng the day of the Epiphany: On whych day about .viii. of
the clocke in the mornyng, his Grace beyng apparelled in a gowne of
cloth of golde, raysed with great flowers or syluer, furred with blacke
Ienettes, his coate Crymsyn sattyn all to cutte and enbrodered &amp; tyed
with great Diamondes, &amp; a ryche Coller about his necke, came solemly
with his Nobilitie into the galery nexte the closettes, and there paused.
                  Then the Lordes went to fetche the Ladye Anne, whiche was apparelled
in a gowne of ryche cloth of golde sette full of large flowers of
great &amp; Orient Pearle, made a

                     ter the Dutche fassion rownde, her here
hangyng downe, whych was fayre, yellowe and long: On her head a
Coronall of golde replenyshed with great stone, and set about full of
braunches of Rosemary, about her necke and myddle, Iuelles of great
valew &amp; estimation, In this apparell she goynge betwene the Erle of
Ouersteyn &amp; the Graunde Master Hostoden, which had the conduyte &amp;
ordre of the performaunce of her maryage, with most demure countynaunce
&amp; sad behauiour, passed thorough the Kynges chaumbre, all the
Lordes goyng before her tyll they came to the galery where the Kyng
was, to whom she made three low obeysaunces &amp; curteisyes. Then the
Archebysshop of Caunte
                        •
                     bury receyued them &amp; maried them together,
and the Erle of Ouersteyn dyd geue her: &amp; aboute her mariyng ryng
was written: GOD SENDE ME VVEL TO KEPE.
                  
                  When the Mariage was celebrate, they went hande in hande into
the Kinges closet and ther hard Masse and offered their tapers, &amp; after
Masse had wyne and spyces, and that done, the Kyng departed to his
chaumbre, &amp; all the Ladyes wayted on her to her chau
                        •
                     bre, the Duke
of Norffolke goyng on the ryght hande, and the Duke of Suffolke on
the lefte hande on her grace.
                  After .ix. of the clocke, the Kyng with a gowne of ryche Tyssue lyned
with Crymosyn Ueluet enbrodered, came to his closet, &amp; she in her
here in the same apparell that she was maryed in, came to her Closet
with her Serieant of Armes and al her Officers, lyke a Queene, before
her. And so the kyng &amp; she went openly on Procession and offered and
dyned together. And after dyner she chaunged into a gowne lyke a
mannes gowne, of Tyssue with longe sleues gyrte to her, furred with
ryche Sables, her narrowe sleeues were very costly, but on her head
she had a cap as she ware on the saturdai before with a cornet of laune,
which cap was so ryche of Perle and Stone, that it was iudged to be
of great valew. And after her fassyon, her Ladyes and Gentlewomen
were apparelled very riche and costly with chaynes of dyuers fassions,
and in this apparell she went that nyght to Eueniong, and after supped
with the Kyng: and after supper were Bankettes, Maskes, and
dyuerse dysportes, tyll the tyme came that it pleased the Kyng and her
to take their rest.
                  The sonday after were kepte solempne Iustes, whyche moche pleased

the straungiers. On whiche daie she was appareiled after the Englishe
fashiō, with a Frenche whode, whiche so set furth her beautie and
good visage▪ that euery creature reioysed to behold her.
                  When the erle of Ouerstein, and other lordes and ladies whiche had
geuen their attendaūce on her grace al that iornay, and had been highly

with her grace, till she wer

                  The fourth daie of February next ensuyng, the kyng and she came to
Westminster by water accompaignied with many nobles and prelates
in Barges, on whom the Maior and his brethren in skarlet, and .xii. of

Penons, and targettes, richely couered and replenished with mynstrelsy,

tooke, that he complained of Barnes to the kyng, and there had
hym examined, and at the last by the Kynges commaundement, he came
to the bishoppes house, where likewise the bishoppe not onely examined
hym, but also toke vpon hym to be his skolemaster, and as moste menne
and specially suche, as muche knewe and least cause had to lye reported,
he prepared the tower for his skole house, and made suche a rod to beate
his skoler, that he beate hym as small as ashes, or he left hym: although
Barnes, with twoo other persones, that is to saie, Iherom and Garret,
of whom in the next yere folowyng, ye shall here more, were by the Bishoppes
procurement, appoynted in the Easter weke folowyng, to preache
at sainct Mary Spittle beside London, the three solempne sermons
in one of the whiche sermons that Barnes made, Barnes openly and before
al the people, asked the Bishop forgeuenes, for speakyng to vnreue
rently of him, in his former sermon, and he required the bishop if he forgaue
hym, in token thereof to holde vp his hande, whiche like as it was
long before he did, so it appered afterwarde to many, that it was but a
counterfeat forgeuenes.
                  The .xii. daie of Aprill began a Parliament, and sir Nicholas Hare
restored to the office of speaker, in the whiche was frely graunted, without
cōtradictiōs, foure fiftenes &amp; a Subsedy, of twoo .s. of landes, and

first daie of Maie, the Tornay the third daie, and the Barriers the fifth
whiche chalenge thei valiaūtly performed, against all commers, and also
thei kept open houshold at Duresme place, and feasted the kyng and
Quene, and all the Lordes. Beside this, on Tewesdaie in the Regacion
weke, thei feasted all the Knightes and Burgesses of the Cōmon house:
and the morowe after thei had the Maior, the Aldermen and all their
wifes to dinner, and so the Fridaie thei brake vp houshold.
               In this Parliament whiche began the .xviii. daie of April, as is afore

rehersed, the religion of sainct Ihones in Englande, whiche of most mē
was named the knightes of the Rhodes, was dissolued, wherof hearyng
sir Willyam Weston knight, Prior of sainct Ihones, for thought died
on the Assencion daie, beyng the fift daie of Maie.
               In this monethe was sent to the Tower, Docter Wilson, and docter

together that night, many wisshyng that that daie, had been seuen
yere before, and some fearyng least he should escape, although he were
imprisoned, could not be mery. Other who knewe nothyng but truth by
hym, bothe lamented hym, and hartely praied for hym: But this is true
that of certain of the Clergie, he was detestably hated, &amp; specially suche
as had borne swynge, and by his meanes was put from it, for in dede
he was a man, that in all his doynges, semed not to fauor any kynde of
Popery, nor could not abide the snoffyng pride of some prelates, whiche
vndoubtedly whatsoeuer els was the cause of his death, did shorten his
life, and procured the ende that he was brought vnto: whiche was that
the .xix. daie of thesaied monethe, he was attaynted by Parliament, and
neuer came to his answere, whiche lawe many reported, he was the causer
of the makyng thereof, but the truthe thereof I knowe not: The Articles
for whiche he died, appereth in the Record, where his attaynder is
written, whiche are to long to bee here reher

                  ed, but to conclude he was
there attainted of heresy, and high treason. And the .xxviii. daie of Iuly
was brought to the skaffold on the tower hill, where he saied these wordes
folowyng.
               I am come hether to dye,The wordes of the Lorde Crōwell spokē at his deth. and not to purge my self, as maie happen,
some thynke that I will, for if I shuold so do, I wer a very wretche and
miser: I am by the Lawe condempned to die, and thanke my lorde God
that hath appoynted me this deathe, for myne offence: For sithence the
tyme that I haue had yeres of discrecion, I haue liued a synner, and offended
my Lorde God, for the whiche I aske hym hartely forgeuenes.
And it is not vnknowne to many of you, that I haue been a greate traueler
in this worlde, and beyng but of a base degree, was called to high
estate, and sithēs the tyme I came therunto, I haue offended my prince,
for the whiche I aske hym hartely forgeuenes, and beseche you all to
praie to God with me, that he will forgeue me. O father forgeue me. O

sonne forgeue me, O holy ghost forgeue me: O thre persons in one God
forgeue me. And now I praie you that be here, to beare me record, I die
in the Catholicke faithe, not doubtyng in any article of my faith, no nor
doubtyng in any Sacrament of the Churche. Many hath sclaundered
me, and reported that I haue been a bearer, of suche as hath mainteigned
euill opinions, whiche is vntrue, but I confesse that like as God
by his holy spirite, doth instruct vs in the truthe, so the deuill is redy to
seduce vs, and I haue been seduced: but beare me witnes that I dye in
the Catholicke faithe of the holy Churche. And I hartely desire you to
praie for the Kynges grace, that he maie long liue with you, in healthe
and prosperitie. And after him that his sōne prince Edward, that goodly
ympe, maie lōg reigne ouer you. And once again I desire you to pray
for me, that so long as life remaigneth in this fleshe, I wauer nothyng
in my faithe. And then made he his praier, whiche was long, but not so
long, as bothe Godly and learned, and after committed his soule, into
the handes of God, and so paciently suffered the stroke of the axe, by a
ragged and Boocherly miser, whiche very vngoodly perfourmed the
Office.
               On sainct Peters euen, was kept the Serieantes feastSergeauntes Feaste. at sainct Ihones
with al plentie of victaile. At whiche feast wer made ten Serieauntes,
three out of Greyes Inne, and three out of Lyncolnes Inne, and of
euery of the Temples twoo. At whiche feast were present, all the lordes
and commons of the Parliament, beside the Maior and the Aldermen,
and a greate nomber of the commons of the citee of London.
               The morowe after Midsomer daie, the kyng caused the Quene to remoue
to Richemond, purposyng it to bee more for her health, open ayre
and pleasure: but the sixt daie of Iuly, certain Lordes came doune into
the neither house, whiche expresly declared causes, that the mariage was
not lawfull, and in conclusion, the matter was by the Conuocacion clerely
determined, that the kyng might lawfully mary where he would, &amp;
so might she: and so were thei clerely deuorsed and seperated, and by the
Parliament enacted and concluded, that she should bee taken no more
as Quene, but called the Lady Anne of Cleue.Quene Anne deuorced▪ and called Ladi

               In this yere the lord Leonard Grey, brother to Thomas lord Marques
Dorset, beyng the kynges lieutenaunt in Ireland, practised sondery
feates for his proffite, as in deliueryng treytors beeyng hostages,
and especially his nephew Fitzgarard, brother to Thomas Fitzgarard
before executed, and also caused suche of the Itishe menne, as he
had intelligence with all, to muade suche of the kynges frendes, whiche
he fauored not: Wherefore the kyng sent for hym, and he mistrustyng
and seyng no refuge, wrote to the kynges enemies, to inuade thenglishe
pale after his departure. And also he kepte the kynges Treasure, to his
awne vse, without reteignyng souldiours, accordyng to his commission
whereupon, when he came to London, he was sent to the Tower.The Lorde Graye sent to the Tower.
               
               In Iuly the Prince of Salerne, in the Realme of Naples, and the

lorde Lois Deuola, came into England to se the kyng, whiche had high
chere and greate rewardes, and so departed. And after them came Done
Fredericke Marques of Padulla, brother to the Duke of Farrar, and
the Prince of Macedonia, and the Marques of Terra Noua, and
Mounsire de Flagy, and sixtene other gentlemen, from the Emperours
Courte into Englande, to see the Kyng, whiche on the daie of Mary
Magdalene, came to the Court to Westminster, and wer highly fea

and well enterteined, and with greate rewardes departed.
               The twentie and eight daie of Iuly▪ as you haue heard before in this
yere, was the Lorde Cromewell behedded, and with hym likewi
                     •
                  e was
behedded the Lorde HongerfordLorde Hungerford beheded. of Heytesbury, whiche certainly at the
tyme of his death, semed to bee very vnquiet in mynde, and rather in a
frenesy then otherwise.
               The thirtie daie of Iuly, were drawen on herdelles out of the Tower
to Smithfeld Robert Barnes Doctor in Diuinitee, Thomas Garard,
and Wyllyam IeromeBarnes, Garrard 
                        •
                      Ierom Bachelers in Diuinitee, Powell, Fetherston,
and Abell. The firste three were drawen to the stake, there before set vp,
and were burned: and the latter three drawen to the Galowes, likewise
there set vp, and were hanged, hedded, and quartered. Here ye must note,
that the first three, wer menne that professed the Gospell of Iesu Christ,
and were Preachers thereof: But wherefore thei were now thus cruelly
executed, I knowe not, although I haue searched to knowe the truth.
But this I finde in their atteindor, for ye muste vnderstande, that after
thei had Preached at sainct Mary Spittle, as before I haue declared,
Barnes for learnyng his lesson no better was committed to the Skolehouse
before prepared, whiche was the Tower, where he was kepte, and
neuer called to examinacion▪ till his rod that he should bee beaten withall,
was made, whiche was a sharp and greate Fire in Smithefelde:
and for compaignie sake, was sent to the Skolehouse with hym, the fornamed
Garet, and Ierome, whiche dronke all of one Cuppe. And as I
saied before, thus muche I finde in their attaindor, that thei were detestable
and abhominable Heretickes, and that thei had taught many heresies,
the nomber whereof was to greate in the atteindor to be recited,
so that there is not one alleged, whiche I haue often wondered at, that
their heresies wer so many, and not one there alleged, as special cause of
their deathe. And in deede at their deathe, thei asked the Shirif
                     •
                  s, wherfore
thei were condempned, who answered, thei could not tell: but if
I maie saie the truthe, moste menne said it was for Preachyng, against
the Doctryne of Stephen Gardiner Bishoppe of Wynchester, who
chiefly procured this their death, God and he knoweth, but greate pitie
it was, that suche learned menne should so bee cast awaie, without examinacion,
neither knowyng what was laied to their charge, nor neuer
called to answere.
               The laste three whiche were Powell, Fetherston, and Abell,Powell, Fetherston, and Abell. were put
to death for Treason, and in their attaindor, is speciall mencion made

of their offences, whiche was for the deniyng of the kynges supremacie,
and affirmyng that his Mariage with the Lady Katheryne was good:
These with other were the treasons, that thei wer attainted of, and suffered
death for.
               The fourthe daie of August Thomas Epsam, sometyme Monke of
Westminster, whiche had been prisoner for treason, thre yeres and more
in Newgate, came before the Iustices of Gaole deliuery at Newegate,
and would not aske the kynges pardon, nor be sworne to be true to him
wherefore his Monkes garment, was plucked from his backe, and he
repr
                     •
                  ed till the kyng knewe his malicious obstinacie: and this was the
last Monke that was seen in his clothyng in Englande.
               In this monethe were certain Commissioners, sent by the kyng into
Ireland, to inquire of the lorde Leonard Gray, whiche certefied diuerse
articles against hym, as ye shall here in the next yere folowyng.
               The eight daie of August, was the Lady Katheryn Haward,Katheryn Haward shewed as Quene. nece to
the duke of Norffolk, and daughter to the lorde Edmond Haward, shewed
openly as Quene at Hampton Court, whiche dignitie she enioyed
not long, as after ye shall here.
               In ye latter ende of this moneth, was vniuersally through the realme
greate death, by reason of newe hote agues and Flixes, and some Pes
                     •
                  ilence,
in whiche season was suche a drougth, that Welles and small Riuers
were cleane dried, so that muche cattell died for lacke of water: and
the Thamis was so shalowe, and the freshe water of so small strength,
that the Salt water flowed aboue London bridge, till the raine had encreased
the freshe waters.
               On the .xxii. daie of December, was Raufe Egerton seruaunt to the
Lorde Audeley, lorde Chauncellor, hanged,Egerton hanged drawen, and quartered, for
counterfetyng of the kynges greate Seale, in a signet, whiche was neuer
seen, and sealed a greate nomber of Licenses for Denizens, and one
Thomas Harman that wrote theim, was executed: for the statute made
the last parliament, sore bounde the straungiers, whiche wer not Denizens,
whiche caused theim to offre to Egerton, greate sommes of money,
the desire whereof caused hym to practise, that whiche brought hym to
the ende, that before is declared.
               In the ende of this yere, the Frenche Kyng made a strong Castle at
Arde, and also a Bridge ouer into the Englishe pale, whiche bridge the
Crewe of Calice did beate doune, and the Frenchemen reedified thesame
and the Englishemen bet it doune again. And after the kyng of Englād
sent fiftene hundred woorke men, to wall and fortefie Guysnes, and sent
with them fiue hundred men of warre, with capitaines to defende them.
The noyes ranne in Fraunce, that there wer fiftie thousande Englishemenne,
landed at Calice with greate ordinaunce: wherefore the Frenche
kyng sent in all hast, the Duke of Uandosme, and diuerse other capitaines,
to the Frontiers of Picardy, to defende thesame. The kyng of Englande
hearyng thereof, sent the Erles of Surrey and Southhampton

and the lorde Russell, his greate Admirall, into the Marches of Calice,
to set an ordre there: and after them sent .CC. light horsemen, of the borders
of Scotlande: whom the Frenchmen called stradiates, whiche lordes
when thei had set all thynges in a good ordre, shortly returned.

this child passed not the age of .xv. yeres, and somewhat as he had
heard some other folkes talke, chaunced to speake against the Sacrament
of the aultar. This boye was accused to Edmond Boner Bishop
of London, who so diligently folowed the accusacion, that he first found
the meanes to Indite hym, and then arreigned hym, &amp; after burned him
And at the tyme he was brought to the stake, he was taught to speake
muche good, of the Bishop of London, and of the greate Charitee, that
he shewed hym: and that he defied all heresies, and curssed the tyme that
euer he knewe Doctor Barnes, for of hym had he learned that heresie,
whiche he died for: The poore boye would for the sauegarde of his life,
haue gladly said that the twelue Apostles taught it hym, for he had not
cared of whom he had named it, suche was his childishe innocencie and
feare. But for this deede many spake and saied, that it was great shame
for the Bishop, who thei saied ought rather to haue labored to saue his
life, then to procure that terrible execucion, seyng that he was suche an
ignoraunt soule, as knewe not what the affirmyng of an heresie was.
               You haue hard before in the beginnyng of this yere, that doctor Wilson,
and doctor Sampson Bishop of Chichester, wer sent vnto the Tower:
who now wer pardoned of the kyng, and set again at their libertie.
            
            
               ¶The .xxxiii. yere.
               
                  IN the beginnyng of this yere, v. priestes in Yorke shire began
a new rebelliō,A newe rebellion. with thassent of one Leigh a gentlemā,
and .ix. temporall men, whiche were apprehended, &amp; shortly
after in diuerse places put in execucion, in somuche that on
the .xvii. daie of Maie, thesaid Leigh &amp; one Tatersall, and
Thornton, wer drawen through London to Tiborne, and there wer executed.
And sir Ihon Neuell knight, was executed for thesame at Yorke.
               On thesame daie was Magaret Countesse of Salisbury, whiche had
been long prisoner in the Tower, behedded in the Tower, and she was
the last of the right lyne and name, of Plantagenet.
               The .ix. daie of Iune, wer Damport and Chapman, twoo of the kynges
Garde, hanged at Grenewiche by the Friers Wall, for roberies in
example of all other.
               Duryng this ceason, the commissioners that before wer sent into Ireland,
to inquire of the lord Gray,The Lorde Graye condempned. certified .xx. articles of high treason against
hym, wherupon he was arreigned &amp; tried by knightes, because he
was a lorde of name, but no lorde of the parliamēt: howbeit he discharged
the Iury, &amp; confessed the inditement, &amp; therupon was iudged, &amp; after
behedded at the tower hill, where he ended his life very quietly &amp; godly.
               In this ceason was arreigned and condempned three gentlemen, called

Mantell, Roydon, and Frowdes, and were hanged at sainct Thomas
of Waterynges. Likewise was Thomas Fines Lorde Dacres of
the Southe, arreigned before the Lorde Awdeley of Walden, then
Chauncellour of Englande, and that daie high Stuard of thesame at
Westminster, and there before thesaied Lorde Chauncellour and his
Peres, he confessed the Inditement, and so had Iudgement to bee hanged.The Lorde Dacres of the South hāged
And so the twentie and nyne daie of Iune, beeyng Sainct Peters
daie at after None, he was led on foote, betwene the twoo Shirifes of
London, from the Tower through the citee to Tyborne, where he was
strangled, as common murderers are, and his body buried in the churche
of sainct Sepulchres. The cause of the death of this noble manne,
and the other gentlemen, was a murder of a symple manne, and an vnlawfull
assemble made in Sussex. Greate moane was made for them al,
but moste specially for Mantell, who was as wittie, and as towarde a
gentleman, as any was in the realme, and a manne able to haue dooen
good seruice.
               This Sommer the Kyng kepte his Progresse to Yorke, and passed
through Lyncolne Shire, where was made to hym an humble submissionSubmissons
by the temporaltie, confessyng their offence, and thankyng the kyng
for his pardon: and the Toune of Staunforde gaue the Kyng twentie
pounde, and Lyncolne presented fourtie pounde, &amp; Boston fiftie pound
that parte whiche is called Lynsey gaue three hundred pounde, and

                     •
                  estren and the Churche of Lyncolne gaue fiftie pounde. And when he
entered into Yorke Shire, he was met with two hundred gentlemen of
thesame Shire, in cotes of Ueluet, and foure thousande tall yomen, and
seruyng men, well horsed: whiche on their knees made a submission, by
the mouthe of sir Robert Bowes, and gaue to the Kyng nyne hundred
pounde. And on Barnesdale met the kyng, the Archebishoppe of Yorke,
with three hundred Priestes and more, and made a like submission, and
gaue the kyng sixe hundred pounde. Like submission was made by the
Maior of Yorke, Newe Castle, and Hull, and eche of theim gaue to the
Kyng an hundred pounde. When the Kyng had been at Yorke twelue
daies, he came to Hull, and deuised there certain fortificacions, and passed
ouer the water of Homber, and so through Lyncolne Shire, and at
Halontide came to Hampton Court.
               At this tyme the Quene late before maried to the kyng called Quene
Katheryne,Quene Katheryne beheded. was accused to the Kyng of dissolute liuyng, before her mariage,
with Fraunces Diram, and that was not secretely, but many
knewe it. And sithe her Mariage, she was vehemently suspected with
Thomas Culpeper, whiche was brought to her Chamber at Lyncolne▪
in August laste, in the Progresse tyme, by the Lady of Rocheforde, and
were there together alone, from a leuen of the Clocke at Nighte, till
foure of the Clocke in the Mornyng, and to hym she gaue a Chayne,
and a riche Cap. Upon this the kyng remoued to London, and she was
sent to Sion, and there kept close, but yet serued as Quene. And for the

offence confessed by Culpeper and Diram, thei were put to death at Tiborne,
the tenth daie of December. And the twentie and two daie of thesame
monethe, were arreigned at Westminster, the lorde Wyllyam Hawarde
and his wife, whiche Lorde Wyllyam was Uncle to the Quene,
Katheryne Tilney whiche was of counsaill of her hauyng to dooe with
Diram, Elizabeth Tilney, Boulmer, Restwould, the Quenes women,
and Walgraue, and Wyllyam Asby, and Damport gentle menne, and
seruauntes to the olde Duches of Norffolke, and Margaret Benet a
Butter wife, all indited of misprision, for counsailyng the euill demeanor
of the Quene, to the slaunder of the Kyng, and his succession: all thei
confessed it, and had Iudgement to perpetuall prison, and to lose their
goodes, and the proffite of their lādes, duryng their lifes: howbeit shortely
after, diuerse of them wer deliuered by the kynges Pardon.
               The sixtene daie of Ianuary the Parliament began, in the whiche the
Lordes and Commons assented, to desire of the kyng certain peticions.
First, that he would not vexe hymself, with the Quenes offence, and that 
she and the lady Rocheford, might be attainted by Parliament.
               Also, because of protractyng of tyme, whiche the more should bee to 
his vnquietnes, that he would vnder his greate Seale, geue his royall
assent, without tariyng the ende of the Parliament.
               Also, that Diram and Culpeper, before attainted by the common law 
might also be attainted by Parliament.
               Also, that Agnes Duches of Norffolke, and Katheryn Countesse of 
Brigewater her daughter, whiche were for counsailyng thesaied offence
committed to the Tower▪ Indited of misprision, and the lorde William
and other, arreigned of thesame, might be likewise attainted.
               Also, that whosoeuer had spoken or doen any act, in the detestacion of
her abhominable liuyng, should be pardoned.
               To the whiche peticions the kyng graunted, saiyng, that he thanked
the Commons, that thei tooke his sorowe to bee theirs. Whereupon the
Quene and the Lady Rocheforde, were attainted by bothe the houses.
And on Saturdaie beyng the leuenth daie of February, the Kyng sent

and his manne, would haue brought him awaie perforce. Diuerse of the
Shirifes officiers there present, withstoode the Serieaunt, so that thei
fell to quarellyng, and the Serieauntes man was sore hurte. After the
Fraie ended, the Shirifes of London whose names wer Rowland Hill,

of the prisoner, howbeit afterward thei deliuered hym. But this matter

Scotlande, who for contemning of the Bisshop of Romes vsurped aucthoritie,
and for praisyng and commendyng the affaires and procedinges

                     •
                   the premisses, doth affirme that he hath holdē these errors
folowyng, openly taught them, and instructed them, that is to saie.
               First, that our moste holiest lorde the Pope, the Uicar of Iesu Christ,
cannot haue nor exercise, any more aucthoritie emongest christians, then
any other bishop or priest.
               Secondly, that Indulgenses and Pardons, graunted by our moste 
holiest lorde the Pope, is of no value strength and efficacie, but vtterly
to the abusion of the people, and the deceiuyng of our soules.
               Thirdly, he saied that the Pope was a Simoniack, euer sellyng gyftes,
and that all priestes might mary.
               Fourthly, that all Englishe heresies (as thei are called) or at the least,
the greater and better part obserued by Englishemen, hath been and is
good, and to be obserued by christen men, as true &amp; consonant to the law
of God: in somuch yt he perswaded very many people to accept thesame.
               Fiftly, that the people of Scotlande, &amp; the clergie therof hath been and 
is vtterly execated and blinded, by affirmaciō that thei had not the true
catholike faith, affirmyng and opēly saiyng, that his faith was of more
value &amp; better, then all the Ecclesiasticalles, of the realme of Scotland.
               Item, likewise accordyng vnto tholde opinions, of Ihō Wi
                     •
                  lief and 
Hus, heresiarches and Master heretikes, condempned in the counsail of
Constantine, he hath affirmed and farther declared, that Ecclesiasticall
persones, should not possesse, haue nor enioye, any temporall possessions
neither exercise iurisdicciō, or any kynd of aucthoritie in temporall matters,
neither vpon their awne subiectes, but that all should vtterly bee
taken awaie from them, as it is in these daies in Englande.
               Item, he hath saied, holden, and affirmed falsely, and contrary to the 
honor, state, and reuerence, of our sacred kynges maiestie of Scotlande
that our kynges maiestie of Scotland, the moste clerest defendor of the

christian faith, would contrary to the lawe and libertie of the holy churche
vendicat and chalenge vnto his priuate vses, all ecclesiasticall possessions:
landes, and yerely rentes, geuen by his fore fathers, and also by
hymself, and to inforce this matter he hath also by writyng perswaded
our moste noble kyng, with all his endeuor.
               
                   Item, he hath willed and sought, and many times hath desired hartely,
that the Churche of Scotlande should come, and be brought to thesame
poynt and ende, and to suche like fall, as the Churche o
                     •
                   England,
is now come to in deede.
               
                   Item, he hath saied, affirmed, and taught openly, the Cannon lawes
and the Decrees of our holy fathers, approued by the Catholike and apostolike
Churche, is of no valewe nor strength, bryngyng in and affirmyng
thesame, for to be made and set furth, contrary to the lawe of God.
               
                   Itē, he hath said holden &amp; affirmed, many yt waies no religion should
be kept, but that should bee abolished and destroyed, and to bee as it is
now destroyed in Englande, and vilipendyng all holy Religion, affirmyng
it to bee an abusion of the people, whose clothyng sheweth manifes

                  ly,
to be deformed mōsters, hauyng no vtilitie or holines, bryngyng
in by this and perswadyng, asmuche as in hym laye, all adherentes of
his opinion, that all the religion in this realme of Scotlande, should be
destroyed and vtterly taken awaie, to the moste greatest losse of the Catholike
Churche▪ and to the deminishyng of Christen religion.
               
                   Item, it is plainly knowen by lawfull probacions, that thesame Ihō
Borthwike, hath had and actually hath, diuerse bokes suspect of heresy
dampned, aswell by the Papall, as by the Regall and ordinary aucthorities
forbidden (that is to saie) firste of all the newe Testament in Englishe,
printed in Englande, Oecolampadius, Melancthon, &amp; diuerse
tractes of Erasmus, and other cōdempned heretickes, and also the boke
of Vnio Discidentium, conteinyng moste manifest errors, and that he hath red,
studied, and communicated, and presented thesame to other men, aswell
openly as priuatly, and that he hath instructed and taughte, very many
Christians in thesame, to the effect, to turne them from the very true and
Catholike faithe.
               
                   Item, it is openly knowen, thesame Ihon Borthwike, to bee so stubburne
in all these foresaid errors and heresies, and to haue susteined and
taught thesame, with suche an indurate mynde, so that he would not declyne
by no maner of meanes frō thesame, for diuerse of his frendes, and
persons whiche loued hym▪ and would haue had hym conuert, to the catholike
faithe, neither would he consent to theim in any wise, but rather
vnmoueably persist in his errors.
               
                   For the whiche said articles, and many other errors holden, saied, publicated
and taught by hym and (as the common voyce is) whiche he stil
holdeth and teacheth, the forsaid Ihon Borthwike to bee taken holden,

                  IN this yere Iames erle of Desmōd came to the kyng and
was honorably entertained &amp; wel rewarded. And in Septembre
the great Onele came to the kyng to Grenewyche,
where he and a capitaine of the North partes of Ireland
called Magannysse and the bishop of Cloar, made their
submission in writyng, cōfessyng their offences, and promisyng to serue
the kyng and his heyres truely: whiche submission by the kyng considered,
he vpon the first day of October created at Grenewyche thesayd
sir Eustace Onele called great Onele (because he was the chiefe of his

Scottes, one, who aboue all other, for our manyfolde benefites towardes
him, hath moste iust cause to loue vs, to honor vs, and to reioyce in
our quietnes: We haue thought good to notify vnto the world his doynges
and behauour in the prouocacion of this warre, and likewise the
meanes and wayes by vs vsed to exchue and aduoyde it, and the iust &amp;
true occasions, wherby we be now prouoked to prosecute thesame, &amp; by
vtteraunce and diuulgyng of that matter, to disburden some part of
our inwarde displeasure and griefe, and the circumstaunces knowen, to
lament openly with the worlde, the infidelitie of this tyme, in whiche
thinges of suche enormitie do brest out and appeare.
               The kyng of Scottes our Nephieu and neighbour, whom we in his
youth and tender age preserued and maintained from the great daunger
of other, and by our authoritie and power cōduced him safely to the
reall possession of his estate, he nowe compelleth and forceth vs for preseruacion
of our honor and right, to vse our puissaūce &amp; power against

cases against Goddes lawe, mannes lawe, and all humanitie:
but the oftener it chaunceth, the more it is to be abhorred, and yet in the
persones of princes for the raritie of theim can so happen but seldome,
as it hath nowe come to passe.
               It hath been very rarely and seldome seen before, that a kyng of

Scottes hath had in mariage a doughter of England: We can not, ne

wherin he nowe so vnkyndly vseth and behaueth him towardes vs, as
he compelleth vs to take armour and warre against him.
               It is specially to be noted, vpon what groundes, &amp; by what meanes

no manne would haue attempted to falsifie for suche a matter. And yet

moste pleasaunt maner, offeryng redresse and reformacion of all attemtates.
And yet neuerthelesse at the entry of the sayd Leyrmouth into
England, a great nombre of the Scottes, than not looked for, made a
forrey into our borders, to the great annoyaunce of our subiectes, and
to their extreme detr

                  ent, wherewith and with that vnsemely dissimulacion,
we were not a litle moued, as reason would we should. And yet
did we not finally to extremely persecute and cōtinue our sayd displeasure,
but that we gaue benigne audience to the sayd Leyrmouth, and
suffered our selfe to be somewhat altred by this woordes and fayre promises,

tendyng to the persuasion that we euer desired, to fynde the kyng
of Scot

                  es suche a Nephieu vnto vs, as our proximitie of bloud, with
our gratuitie vnto him, did require.
               In the meane tyme of these fayre wordes, y• dedes of the borders wer
as extreme as might be, and our subiectes spoyled: and in a roade made
by sir Robert Bowes for a reuenge therof, thesame sir Robert Bowes
with many other taken prisoners, &amp; yet deteined in Scotland, without
puttyng them to fine and raunsome, as hath be euer accustomed. And
beyng at the same tyme a surceaunce made on bothe sides at the suite of
the sayd Leyrmouth for a season: the Scottes ceassed not to make sundry
inuasion into our realme in suche wise, as we wer compelled to forget
fayre woordes, and onely to consider the kyng of Scottes dedes,
whiche appeared vnto vs of that sorte, as they ought not for our dutie

                   subiectes, ne could not in respect of our honor, be passed
ouer vnreformed: and therfore put in a readynesse our armye, as a due
meane wherby we might attaigne suche a peace, as for the safegard of
our subiectes we be bound to procure.
               After whiche praparacion made, and knowlege had therof, the kyng
of Scottes ceassed not to vse his accustomed meane of fayre woordes,
whiche in our naturall inclinacion wrought eftsones their accustomed
effect, euermore desirous to fynd in the kyng of Scottes suche a regard
and respect to be declared in dedes as the correspondence of naturall
loue in the Nephieu to suche an Uncle, as we haue shewed our selfe towardes
him, doth require. Wherfore vpō newe request and suite made
vnto vs, we determined to staye our armye at Yorke, appointyng the
duke of Norffolke our Lieutenaunt, the lorde Priuyseale, the bishop
of Dureham, and the Master of our horses, there to commen, treate and
conclude with the Ambassadors of Scotland, for an amitie and peace
vpon suche condicions, as by reason &amp; equitie were indifferent, wherby
the warre might be exchued, beyng by sundry inuasion of the Scottes
than open and manyfest.
               In this communicacion betwene our and theyr commissioners, after
dyuers degrees of cōmissions, shewed by the Scottes, and finally one,
that was by our commissioners allowed, mat

                     •
                  
to reason, as the commissioners of Scotland sayd, they doubted not,
but if it might be brought to passe, that the kyng of Scottes our Nephieu
might haue a metyng with vs, all matters should easely be componed
and determined. Wherevpon they left speakyng of any articles
of amitie, and the ambassadors of Scotland made muche outward ioy
in communicacion of metyng, they shewed theimselfe in wordes, facion
&amp; behauor muche to delight in it, to re
                     •
                  oyce in it, &amp; therewith thought it
easy and facile to be cōcluded and accomplished, and for their part thei
toke it then for a thyng passed, a thyng concluded, and moste certain to
take effect, and onely desired vi. dayes to obteigne aunswere from their

Master, and our armye for that tyme to stay and go no further: Whervnto
our commissioners then agreed.
               After these vi. dayes was sent a Commission out of Scotland, with
power to conclude a metyng precisely at suche a place, as they knewe
well we would not, ne could not in wynter obserue and kepe, wherwith
when our commissioners were miscontent, the Ambassadors of Scotland
to relieue that displeasure, and to tempre the matter, whereby to
wynne more tyme, shewed forth their instruccions, wherin libertie was
geuen to the ambassadors to excede their cōmission in the appointment
of the place, and to consent to any other by our commissioners thought
conuenient, whiche maner of procedyng, when our commissioners re
                     •
                  used,
alleging that thei would not conclude a metyng with men, hauyng
no commission thervnto: the ambassadors of Scotland vpon pretence
to send for a more ample and large cōmission agreable to their instruccions
for appointment of the place, obteined a delay of other vi. dayes,
to send for thesayd ample commission without restraint of place. And
after those vi. dayes they brought forth a newe commission, made in a
good fourme, and without excepcion: But therewith they shewed also
newe instruccions, cōteinyng suche a restainte as the former cōmission
did conteine, so as the libertie geuen to the Commissioners in the commission
was nowe at the last remoued and taken away by the instruccions,
with addicion of a special charge to the Ambassadors not to excede
thesame.
               And thus first the Ambassadors of Scotlād semed to haue wyll and
desire to conclude a place semely and conuenient, whiche for want of cō
                  mission
thei might not do, &amp; at the last might haue concluded a metyng
by vertue of their commission, and then for feare of the cōmaundement
in their secōd instruccions they durst not. And so they shewed their first
instruccions partly to excuse their kyng, who should seme secretely to
wyll more, than in the commission he did openly professe.
               And than with an ample commission frō the kyng, they shewed their
secrete instruccions for defence of theimselfe, why they proceded not accordyng
to their commission, not caryng how muche they charged therin
their kyng, whose faulte they disclosed to discharge theim selfe, trustyng
that by benefite of the Wynter approchyng, and the tyme lost in
their cōmunicacion their Master should be defēded against our power
for this yere, without doyng for their part that by honor, right, lawe, &amp;
leagues they be obliged and bound to do. And in this meane tyme our
subiectes taken prisoners in Scotland could not be deliuered vpon any
raūsome, cōtrary to all custome and vsage of the borders in the tyme
of peace and warre, and in this meane tyme stayed a great part of our
armye allready prested, and in our wages to go forward. In this tyme
Ambassadours (as ye haue heard) assembled to talke of an amitie and
conclude it not. The treatyng of amitie was put ouer by communicacion
of a metyng.
               
                  The cōmunicacion of metyng was so handled by alteracion of commission
and instruccions on their behalfe, as it appereth a plaine deuise

                  e for a delay, whiche hath geuen vs light, wherevpon
more certainly to iudge the kyng of Scottes inwarde affeccion towardes
vs, whose dedes and woordes well wayed and considered, doeth vs
plainely to vnderstande, how he hath continually labored to abuse vs
with swete and pleasaunt woordes, and to satisfy the appetites of other
at home and abrode with his vnkynde and displeasaunt dedes. In his
wordes he professeth an insoluble amitie, he allegeth kynred, he knowlegeth
benef
                     •
                  tes, onely the faulte is that he speaketh another language
to all the worlde in dedes, and thereby so toucheth vs in honor and denegacion
of iustice, as we be inforced and compelled to vse the sworde,
whiche God hath

                  ut in our hand as an extreme remedy, wherby to obteigne
both quietnes for our subiectes, and also that is due vnto vs by
right, pactes, and leagues.
               We haue paciētly suffered many delusions, and notably the last yere
when we made preparacion at Yorke for his repaire to vs: But should
we suffre our people and subiectes to be so oft spoyled without remedy?
This is done by the Scottes whatsoeuer their wordes be. Should we
suffer our rebelles to be deteigned contrary to the leagues without remedy?
This is also done by theim whatsoeuer their woordes be.
               Should we suffre our land to be vsurped contrary to our moste plaine
euidence, onely vpon a wille, pryde, and arrogancie of the other partie?
This is done by thē whatsoeuer their wordes be. And all these be ouer

                  umptuously done against vs, &amp; geue suche significaciō of their arrogācie,
as it is necessary for vs to oppresse it in the beginnyng, lest thei
should gather further courage to ye greater displeasure of vs &amp; our posteritie
hereafter. And yet in ye intreatyng of this mattter, if we had not
euidently perceiued the lacke of suche affeccion as proximitie of bloud
should req
                     •
                  ire, we would muche rather haue remitted these iniuries in
respect of proximitie of bloud to our Nephieu, than we did heretofore y•
inuasion of his father. But consideryng we be so surely ascertained of ye
lacke therof, &amp; that our bloud is there frorne wt the colde ayre of Scotland,
ther was neuer prince more violently compelled to warre then we
be, by the vnkynde dealyng, vniust behauor, vnprincely demeanour of
him that yet in nature is our Nephieu, and in his actes and dedes declareth
himselfe not to be moued ther wt; ne to haue suche ernest regarde
to the obseruacion to his pactes and leagues, ne suche respect to the intertainement
of the administracion of iustice, as naturall equitie byndeth,
and cōseruacion of amitie doeth require: whiche we muche lament
and be sory for, and vse nowe our force and puissaunce against him, not
for reuengeance of our priuate displeasure (beyng so often deluded as
we haue been) but for recouery of our right, the preseruaciō of our subiectes
frō iniuries, &amp; the obseruacion of suche leagues as haue passed
betwene vs, firmely trustyng, that almightie God vnder whom we

reigne, woll assist and ayde our iust procedynges herein to the furtheraunce
and aduauncement of the right, whiche we doubt not shall euer
preuaile against wrong, falsehead, deceipte and dissimulacion.
               Hitherto it appeareth how this present warre hath not proceded of
any demaunde of our right of superioritie, whiche the kyng of Scottes
haue alwayes knowleged by homage and fealtie to our progenitours
euen from the beginnyng: But this warre hath been prouoked &amp; occasioned
vpō present matter of displeasure, present iniury, present wrong
ministred by the Nephieu to the Uncle moste vnnaturally, and supported
cōtrary to the desertes of our benefites moste vnkyndly. If we had
mynded the possession of Scotland, &amp; by the mocion of warre to attain
thesame, there was neuer kyng of this realme had more oportunitie in
the minoritie of our nephieu. Ne in any other realme a prince that hath
more iust title, more euident title, more certain title, to any realme that
he can clayme, then we haue to Scotland, not deuised by pretence of
mariage, not imagined by couenaunt, or contriued by inuencion of argument,
but lineally descended from the beginnyng of that a state established
by our progenitors, and recognised successiuely of the kynges
of Scotland by dedes, woordes, actes and writynges continually almost
without interrupcion, or at the leest intermission, till the reigne of

haue euer been alwayes glad, rather without preiudice to omitte to demaunde
our right, if it might cōserue peace, than by demaūdyng therof
to be seen to moue warre, specially against our neighbor, against our
Nephieu, against him, whom we haue preserued from daungier, and in
suche a tyme as it were expedient for all Christendome to be vnite in
peace, wherby to be the more able to resist the cōmon enemy the Turke.
               But for whatsoeuer cōsideracions we haue omitted to speake hitherto

               This appeareth fyrst by history, written by suche as for confirmacion
of the trueth in memory, haue truely noted and signified the same.
               Secondly it appeareth by instrumentes of homage made by the kyng

               Fyrst as concernyng histories, whiche be called witnesses of tymes,

the light of trueth, and the life of memory, &amp; finally the conuenient way
and meane, whereby thynges of antiquiti
                     •

                   a consent of writers, as could not so agree vppon an
vntrueth, conteignyng declaracion of suche matter as hath moste euident
probabilitie &amp; apparaunce. For as it is probable and likely, that
for the better administracion of iustice amonges rude people, two or m
                     •
                  
of one estate might be rulers in one countrey vnite as this Isle is: so is
it probable and likely, that in the beginnyng it was so ordred for auoydyng
discencion, that there shuold be one superior in right, of whom the
sayd estates should depend. Accordyng whervnto we rede how Brute,
of whom the realme than called Brytain tooke 
                     •
                  yrst tat name (beyng
before that tyme inhabited with Gyauntes, people without order or ciuilitie)
had thre sonnes, Loc
                     •
                  ine, Albanact, and Camber, &amp; determinyng
to haue the whole Isle within the Occean sea to be after gouerned by
theim thre, appointed Albanact to rule that nowe is called Scotland,
Camber the parties of Wales, and Locrine that nowe is called England:
vnto whō as beyng the elder sonne, the other two brothers should
do homage recognisyng and knowlegyng him as theyr superior. Now
consider if Brutus cōquered al this Iland, as the history sayeth he did,
and then in his own tyme made this order of superioritie as afore: how
can there be a title deuised of a more plaine beginnyng, a more iust beginnyng,
a more conuenient beginnyng for the order of this Iland, at
that tyme specially when the people were rude, whiche cannot without
continual strife and variaunce cōteine two or thre rule
                     •
                  s in al pointes
equal without any maner of superioritie, the inward conscience and remorse
of whiche superioritie should in some part dul and diminishe the
peruerse corage of resistence and rebellion. The fyrst diuision of this
Isle we fynde it written a
                     •
                  ter this sort without cause of suspeccion why
they should write amysse. And accordyng herevnto we fynde also in
history set forth by diuers, how for transgression against this superioritie,
our predecessors haue chastised the kynges of Scott

                  s, and some
deposed, and put other in theyr places.
               We will here omit to speake of the rudenes of the antiquitie in particularitie,
whiche they cared not distinctly to commit to writyng, but
some authors, as Anthonius Sabellicus amonges other diligently
enserchyng, what he might truely write of all Europe, and the Ilandes
adioynyng, ouer and besydes that whiche he writeth of the nature, maners,
and condicions of the Scottes, whiche who so lyst to rede, shall
fynde to haue been the very same in tymes paste, that we fynde theim

who reigned in this realme, lvi. yeres. And therfore betwene
the homage made by the sayd Alexander kyng of Scottes, and the homage
done by Alexander, sonne, to ye sayd kyng of Scottes, to Edward
the fyrst at his coronacion at Westminster, there was about fifty yeres
at whiche tyme the sayd Alexander kyng of Scottes repayred to the
sayd feast of coronacion, and there did his duetie as is aforesayd.
               Within xxviii. yeres after that, whiche was the yere of our lorde M.

after a great victory had in Scotlād against thother factiō, &amp; enioying
the croune of Scotlande, made homage to our progenitour Edwarde
the third.
               And xx. yeres after that, whiche was in the yere of our Lorde M.
CCCxxvi. Dauid Bruse, who was euer in the contrary faction, did neuerthelesse
in the title of the croune of Scotland, whereof he was then
in possession, make homage to our sayd progenitor Edward the third.

Edwarde Balliol hauyng the iust and right title to the realme of
Scotlande, surrendred

                  lerely thesame to our sayd progenitour at the

thesame, and than caused himselfe to be crouned kyng of Scotland,
and for a tyme enterteigned it, and enioyed it, as very proprietary
and owner of the realme, as on thone partie by confiscacion acquired, &amp;
on the other part by free will surrendred vnto him.
               And then after the death of our sayd progenitour Edward the third,
beganne sedicions and insurreccions in this our realme, in the tyme of

attende vpō him in that iourney. And in this tyme the realme of Scotland
beyng descended to the house of the Stewardes, of whiche our
Nephieu directly commeth, Iames Stewarde kyng of Scottes, in the
yere of oure Lorde M.CCCC.xxiii. made homage to Henry the vi. at
Wyndsore. Whiche homage was distaunt from the tyme of the other
homage made by Dauid Bruse lx. yeres and more, but farre within the
freshe memory of man.
               All whiche homages and fealties as they appeare by storye to haue
been made and done at tymes and season as afore: so do there remayne
instrumentes made thervpon and sealed with the seales of the kynges
of Scotland testifiyng thesame. And yet doeth it appere by story, how
the Scottes practi

whiche neuerthelesse were after recouered againe. And to
the intent ye may knowe of what fourme and tenour the sayd instrumē
                  tes
be, here is inserted the effecte in worde and sentence as they be made,
whiche we do, to mete with the cauellacion and contriued euasion of the
Scottes, allegyng the homage to haue been made for the Erledome of

Hūtyngtō, which is as trew as the allegatiō of him that is burnt in the
hande, to saye he was cut with a sikle. And therfore the tenour of the homage
is this.
               
                  I Ihon .N. kyng of Scottes shall be trew and faithfull vnto you
lorde Edward by the grace of god kyng of England, the noble and superior
lorde of the kyngdome of Scotland, and vnto you I make my
fidelitie of thesame kyngdome of Scotland, the which I hold, &amp; claime
to holde of you: and I shall beare to you my faith and fidelitie of life &amp;
lymme and worldly honour against all men, &amp; faithfully I shal knowlege,
and shal do to you seruice due vnto you of the kyngdome of Scotland
a foresaied, as god so helpe and these holy euangelies.
               
               Now for the third parte touchyng recordes and registres, wee haue
them so formall, so autentiquall, so seriously handeled, and with such
circumstaunces declaryng the matiers, as thei be &amp; ought to be a great
corroboracion of that hath ben in stories writen &amp; reported in this matter.
For a monges other thynges we haue the solempne act, and iudicial
processe of our progenitour Edward the first, in discussion of the title
of Scotland, when the same was challenged by twelue competitours:
That is to say,
               
                  Forentius comes Holandie.
                  Patricius de Dūbar comes de Merchia.
                  VVillielmus de Vesty
                  VVillielmus de Ros.
                  Robertus de Pinbeny.
                  Nicholaus de Soules.
                  Patritius Galightly.
                  Rogerus de Mundeville
                  Ioannes de Comyn.
                  D. Ioannes de Hastinges.
                  Ioannes de Balliolo.
                  Robertus de Bruse.

                        •
                     ius rex Norvvegie.
               
               And finally, after a great consultacion and mature deliberacion, with
dis
                     •
                  ussion of the allegations proponed on all parties, sentence was geuen
for the title of Balliol, accordyng wher vnto he enioyed the realme.
But for confirmaciō of the dutie of the homage before that tyme obserued
by the kynges of Scottes, it appereth in those recordes, how when
those competitours of the Realme of Scotlande repaired to oure saied
progenitour, as to the chief lorde for discussion of the same, in as muche
as the a
                     ••
                  horitie of the iudgement to be geuen depended ther vpon: It
was than ordered, that the whole parliament of Scotlande spirituall
temporall and of all degrees assembled for that purpose, and cōsidering
vpon what ground and foundation the Kynges of Scotlande had in
tymes past made the saied homages and recognition of superioritie, the
saied parliament 
                     •
                  yndyng the same good and trew, should if thei so demed
it, yeld and geue place, and by expresse consent recognise thesame.
At whiche parliament was alledged vnto them, as appereth in the same
recordes, not only these actes of the princes before those daies, &amp; befor
rehersed: but also besides the testimonye of stories, the writynges and

letters of forein princes, at that tyme recityng and rehersyng thesame:
Wherevppon thesaied parliament did ther agree to this our superioritie,
and ensuyng their determination did particularly and seuerally
make homage and fealtie with Proclamation, that whosoeuer withdrue
him sel
                     •
                  e from doyng his dutie therein, shoulde be reputed as a rebell:
And so all made homage and fealtie to oure progenitour Edward
the first. This Realme was in the tyme of the discussion of the title ruled
by Gardians deputed by hym, al castels and holdes were surrendered to
him as to the superior lord in the tyme of vacation, benefises, offices,
fees, promotiōs passed in that tyme from the mere gift of our saied
progenitour, as in the right of this croune of England, Shirifes named
and appointed, writtes and preceptes made, obeied, and executed:
and finally all that wee do nowe in the Duchie of Lancaster, the same
dyd our progenitour for the tyme of our contencion for that title in the
realme of Scotlande, by the consent of an agrument of all estates of
the realme assembled and consulted with for that purpose. At whiche
tyme the bishopes of saint Andrewes and Glascoo wer not as thei now
be arche byshopes, but recognised the archebishop of Yorke, whiche extended
ouer al that countrey,
               Now if the Scottes wil take exception to the homage of ther princes
as made in warr and by force whiche is not true: what will thei say or
can thei for shame allege against ther awne parliament, not of some but
of all confirmed and testefied by there writynges and seales? wherevnto
nothyng enforced them, but right and reason, beyng passed in peace
&amp; q
                     •
                  iet wit
                     •
                  out armoure or compulsion. If thei say thei did it not, thei
speake like them selfes, If thei say thei did it, then do they now like them
self, to withdraw ther duetie, not so much to be blamed, as to be amēded.
               Thus apereth vnto you the begynnyng of the right of superioritie,
with a perpetuall continuaunce, without intermission within memorie,
certayne omssi
                     •
                  on and forbearyng vpon the groundes and occasions
before specified we deny not. Wherby thei haue many times sought and
taken there oportunities, to withdraw the doyng of ther dutie in knowlege
of our superioritie ouer them, which to auoyde, thei haue not cared
what thei saied or alleged▪ though it wer neuer s vntrue: lyeng alwaies
in a wait whan thei might annoy this Realme, not without there awne
great daunger, peril, &amp; extreme detryment. But as thei detracted the doyng
of their dutie, so god euer graunted vnto this realme force to compell
them thervnto within memorie, notwithstandyng any their interruptiō
by resistaunce, which vnto the tyme of our progenitor Hēry the
sixt neuer indured so long as it made intermission within tyme of mynd
wherby they possession might seme to be enpaired, from the time of Henry
the sixte vnto the seuenth yere of oure reigne, oure Realme hath bene
for a season lacerate and torne by diuersitie of titles tyll oure tyme
and sithence by war outwardly vexed &amp; troubled: The storye is so lalamentable

for some parte therof, as were tedious to reherse,
               Sythen the death of our progenitor, Henry the .vi. our Graundfather
Edward the .iiii. reigned, who after great traueyls to attayne quietnes
in his Realme, finally in the tyme of preparation of warr against
Scotland, dyed.
               Rycharde the .iii. then vsurped for a small tyme in yeres, whom the
Kyng our father by the strength of Gods hand ouerthr
                     •
                  w in battayll,
and most iustly attayned the possession of this Realme, who neuerthelesse
after the great tempestious stormes, fyndynge all matters not yet
brought to a perfecte quyet and rest, ceassed and forbare to requyre of
the Scottes to do their duty, thinkyng it policy rather for that tyme to
assay to tame their nature by the pleasaunt coniunction &amp; conuer
                     •
                  ation
of affinitie, then to charge them with their faulte, and requyre dutye of
them, when oportunitie serued not, by force and feare to constrayne &amp;
compell them.
               And thus passed ouer the reigne of our father, without demaunde of
this homage▪ And beyng our reigne nowe .xxxiiii. yeres, we were .xxi.
yere latted by our Nephieu his minoritie, beyng then more careful how
to bryng him out of daūger, to the place of a king, then to receiue of him
homage when he had full possession of the same. Wherfore beyng now
passed sithens the last homage made by the king of Scottes to our progenitor
Henry the .vi.C.xxii. yere, at which tyme the homage was done
at Wyndesore by Iames Stuard, then kyng of Scottes, as afore, lvi.
of these yeres the crowne of this Realme was in contencion, the trouble
wherof engendred also some busynesse in the tyme of the kyng our father,
which was xxiiii. yere: And in our tyme .xxi. yere hath passed in the
minoritie of our Nephieu. So as finally the Scottes resortynge to
their only defence of discontinuance of possession, can only alledge iustli
but .xiii. yere of sylence in the tyme of our reygne, beynge all the other
tymes sythens the homage done by Iames Steward, suche as the sylence
in them had thei ben neuer so long, could not haue engendred preiudice
to the losse of any ryght, that may yet be declared &amp; proued due.
For what can be imputed to Kyng Edward for not demaundyng homage
beynge in stryfe for that estate, whervnto the homage was due?
What should Rychard the ▪iii. serch for homage in Scotland▪ that had
neither ryght ne leasure to haue homage done vnto hym in Englande?
Who can blame our father, knowyng the Scottes nature, neuer to do
their dutie but for feare, if he demaunded not that of them, whych they
woulde exchue if thei might, beyng his Realme not clerely then purged
from yll seede of sediciō, sparkled &amp; scattered in the cruell ciuile warres
before.
               Lawe and reason serueth, that the passyng ouer of tyme not commodious
y• the purpose, is not allegeable in prescriptiō for the losse of any
ryght. And the minoritie of the kyng of Scottes hath endured .xxi.
yeres of our reigne, whiche beynge an impediment on their parte, the

whole prescription of the Scottes, if the matter were prescriptible, is
thus deduced euidently to .xiii. yere, which .xiii. yere without excuse we
haue ceassed and forborne to demaunde our dutie, lyke as the Scottes
haue lykewyse 
                     •
                  eassed to offer and tende the same. For whych cause neuerthelesse
we doo not enter this warre, ne mynded to demaunde anye
suche matter, nowe beyng rather desirous to reioyce and take comfort
in the frendship of our Nephieu, as our neyboure, then to moue matter
vnto hym of displeasure, wherby to alienate suche naturall inclinacion
of loue, as he should haue toward vs. But such be the workes of God,
superior ouer all, to suffer occasions to be ministred, wherby due superioritie
maye be knowen, demaunded and requyred, to the entent that
accordyng ther vnto all thynges gouerned in due ordre here, we may to
his pleasure passe ouer this lyfe to his honor &amp; glorye: which he graunt
vs to doo, in suche rest, peace and tranquilitie, as shalbe mete and conuenient
for vs.
               When the Kyng had setfurth the Declaracion of the cause of his war
as is aboue mencioned. Then sent he furth the duke of Norffolke Li

from the kyng of Scottes, the Bisshop of Orkeney and Iames Leiremouth
Maister of the houshold, to entreate peace, but they agreed not.
And the Armye laye so long in Scotland

Hampton which dyed at New Castell, was borne in the forwarde, because
he was appoynted Capitayne of the same.

Ihon Lesley Bastard to the Erle of Rothus, and twoo hundred gentlemenne
more, and aboue eight hundred common people, in somuche that
some one man, yea, and women had three or foure prisoners. Thei toke
also twentie and foure gonnes, foure cartes with speares, and ten pauiliōs.
This was onely the handstroke of God, for the Cardinal of Scotlande
promised them heauen, for destruccion of Englande.
               The kyng of Scottes tooke a greate thought,The death of the Scottishe Kyng. for this discomfiture,
and also because that an Englishe Herauld called Somerset was slain
at Dunbarre, whiche thynges together he tooke so vnpaciently that he
died in a Frenesy. Although many reported that the kyng hymself was
at this bickeryng, and there receiued his deathes wounde, and fled therwith
into Scotlande. But howsoeuer it was, true it is as is aforesaied
he died, and the Quene his wife was deliuered of a daughter, on our lady
Euen before Christmas, called Mary. Of the prisoners aforesaied
twentie and foure of the chief of theim, were brought vp to the Tower
of London, and there were twoo daies. And on Saincte Thomas daie
the Apostle before Christmas, thei were solemply conueighed through
London to Westminster, where the Kynges counsaill sat, and there the
Lorde Chauncellor, declared to theim their vntruthe, vnkyndenes, and
false dissimulacion, declaryng farther how the kyng had cause of warre
against them, bothe for the deniyng of their homages, and also for their
trayterous inuasions without defiaunce, and also for kepyng his subiectes
prisoners without redempcion, contrary to the olde Lawes of the
Marches, for whiche doynges, God as thei might perceiue had skourged
theim: Howbeit the kyng more regardyng his honor, then his princely
power, was content to shewe to theim kyndenes, for vnkyndenes,
and right for wrong. And although he might haue kept theim in straite
prison, by iuste lawe of Armes, yet he was content that thei should haue
libertie, to bee with the nobles of his Realme, in their houses. And so accordyng
to their estates, thei wer appoynted to Dukes, Erles, Bishoppes,
Knightes, and other Gentlemen, whiche so entretaigned theim, that
thei confessed theimselfes, neuer to bee better enterteigned, nor to haue
had greater chere.
               
                  But after their newe gladnes, tidynges came to theim, of the death of
their Kyng, whiche thei sore lamented, and hearyng that he had lefte an
onely daughter his heire, thei wisshed her in Englande, to bee maried to
the Prince the kynges sonne. The Kyng and his Counsaill, perceiuyng
the ouerture nowe to bee made, whiche waie without warre these twoo
realmes, might bee brought into one, sent for all the prisoners fewe lackyng,
to his Manor of Hāpton Court, on sainct Stephens daie, where
thei wer so well enterteigned, bothe of the kyng and his nobles, that thei
saied, thei neuer sawe kyng but hym, and saied that God was better serued
here, then in their countrey: howbeit their Kirkmen preached, that in
Englande was neither Masse, nor any seruice of God. And thei promised
the kyng, to doo all that in theim laie with their frendes to performe
asmuche as he required. Whereupon not without greate rewardes, thei
departed towarde Scotlande, on Newe yeres daie, and by the waie thei
sawe the Prince, and came to Newe Castle to the Duke of Suffolke,
who vpon hostages deliuered theim, and so the

set on by the Frenche kyng, for thesame cause) had forged a will, that
the kyng had made hym Gouernour, associate with twoo Erles of his
affinitie, bothe of the Realme, and of the young Quene, contrary to the
Lawes of Scotlande. Whereupon thesaied Erle of Arrain, accordyng
to his right, with the helpe of his frendes, tooke vpon hym the rule of
Gouernour, and put thesaied false Cardinall in prison, and deliuered sir
Robert Bowes and other prisoners, by their bandes, accordyng to the
custom of the Marches. And so in Marche next folowyng, the Scottes
beganne their Parliament.
               All this yere there was neither perfite peace, nor open warre, betwene
Englande and Fraunce, but Shippes were taken on bothe sides, and
Merchantes robbed. And at the laste the Merchantes goodes on bothe
parties were seazed, and likewise the Ambassadours, of bothe Realmes
were staied: howbeit shortly after, the Ambassadours wer deliuered, but
yet the Merchauntes wer robbed, and no warre proclaimed.
               In the ende of this yere, came from the Gouernour of Scotlande as
Ambassadours, sir William Hambleton, Iames Leyremouthe, and the
Secretory of Scotland, whose message was so meanely liked, that thei
were fain to sende an Herauld into Scotlande, for other Ambassadors,

and so hether came the erle of Glancarn, and sir George Douglash and
whatsoeuer their answere was, sir George returned in Poste, and within
twentie daies, came again with an honest answere, but that honestie
eudured a small tyme.
            
            
               ¶The .xxxv. yere.
               
                  IN the beginnyng of this yere on Trinitie Sondaie, was
a newe League sworne, betwene the Kyng and the Emperour,
at Hampton Courte, to bee frendes to their frendes,
and enemies to their enemies.
               The thirde daie of Iune came to the Courte, from the
Realme of Irelande, the Lorde Obryn, the Lorde Macke Willyam
Brough, the Lorde Macke Gilpatricke. And in Iuly thesaied Obryn
was created Erle of Townon, and Lorde Macke Willyam, was created
Erle of Claurikard, and sir Dunon Obryn was made Baron of
Ebranky, and so with rewardes thei tooke their leaue, and returned.
Also thesame Monethe, the Scottishe Ambassadours returned with
greate rewardes.
               At this season the Kyng and the Emperoure, sent Garter and Toyson
Kynges at Armes, to demaunde certaine thynges of the Frenche
Kyng, whiche if he did deny, then to defie hym, but he would not suffer
theim to come within his lande, and so thei returned. Whereupon thesaied
demaundes, were shewed to the Ambassadoure at Westminster.
And in Iuly the Kyng sent ouer sixe thousande tall menne, whereof
was Capitain generall, sir Ihon Wallop, and sir Thomas Seymour
Marshall, and sir Richarde Cromewell Capitain of the horsse menne,
whiche assaulted a Toune called Laundersey,Laundersey vnto the whiche assaulte
came the Emperoure in proper person. And shortely after came doune
the Frenche Kyng in proper persone, with a greate armie, and offered
the Emperoure battaill, by reason whereof the siege was reysed, and
streight the Frenche menne victayled the Toune, whiche was the
onely cause of their commyng. For the nexte daie, the Emperoure beeyng
ready, at the houre appoynted to geue battaill, and the Frenchemenne
made greate shewe, as though thei would haue come forwarde,
but thei dalied of all that Daie, and in the Night, thei ranne a waie,
and trusted some to their Horsses, and some to their legges like tall felowes.
               In this Monethe were Indited, arraigned and condempned at new
Wynsore▪ foure menne,Foure persō

Testwood a Syngyng manne Henry Filmer a Taylor, and Ihon
Marbeck a Syngyng manne. All these menne were at one tyme, as
is aforesaied, arreigned and condempned of Heresie, by force of the sixe
Articles. The Heresies that thei were condempned for, were these as
thei are alleged in their Inditementes: Firste, that Anthony PersoneAntony Person.
                  
should Preache twoo yere before he was arreigned, in a place called
 Wynkefelde, and there should saie. That like as Christe was hanged
betwene twoo Thefes, euen so when the Prieste is at Masse, and hath
consecrated and lifteth hym vp ouer his hedde, then he hangeth betwene
twoo Thefes, excepte he Preache the woorde of God truly, as he hath
taken vpon hym to do.
               
                   Also that he saied to the people in the Pulpet, ye shall not eate the body
of Christe, as he did hang vpon the Crosse, gnawyng it with youre
teethe, that the bloud tonne about your lippes, but you shall eate it this
daie, as ye eate it to morow, the next daie and euery daie, for it refresheth
not the body, but the spirite.
               
                   Also, after he had preached and commended the Scripture, callyng it
the woorde of God, saied as foloweth. This is the woorde, this is the
bread, this is the body of Christ.
               
                   Also, he saied that Christe sittyng with his disciples, tooke bread and
blessed it, and brake it, and gaue it to his Disciples saiyng. This is my
fleshe, take it and eate it: and like wise tooke the Wyne and blessed it,
and gaue it to his Disciples saiyng, take it and drynke it: This is my
bloudde. What is this to vs, but to take the Scripture of God, and to
breake it to the people.
               Item, Henry FilmerHēry Filmer the Taylour arraigned of this Article, that he
should saie. That the sacrament of the Aultare, is nothyng but a similitude
and a Ceremony. And also, if God be in the Sacrament of the aultare,
I haue eaten twentie Goddes in my life.

the tyme that the Prieste was liftyng vp the Sacrament, what, wilte
thou lifte hym vp so high, what yet higher, take hede, let hym not fall.
               Ihon Marbecke arreigned,Ihon Marbecke. for that he had with his awne hande, gathered
out of diuerse mennes writynges, certain thynges that were expresly
against bothe the Masse, and the Sacrament of the Aultar.
               These foure persones, were arraigned, condempned, and burned for
the articles aboue saied, except Ihon Marbecke, whose honestie and innocencie,
purchased hym the Kynges Pardon, the other thre wer burned
at Wynsore aforsaied.
               Beside these menne, were a greate nomber of Gentle menne, aswell of
the Kynges priuie Chamber, as other Indited, by the procurement of
one Doctor London,Doctor London: Wyllyam Symons▪

                  e to the
Kynges Maiestie, declaryng in what case thei stoode. Whereupon
Doctor London was examined, and so was thesaied Symones, whiche
vpon their Othe of allegeaunce, denied their Trayterous purposes, as
after it was proued to their faces. Wherefore thei were adiudged as
Periured persones, to weare Papers in Wynsore, and so thei did, and
were after committed to the Flete, where thesaied Doctour London
died. And here haue I an occasion, because of doctor Londons periury,

to tell you howe he was also the occasyon that another commytted wylfull
periury. The matter was, that a certayne robbery was commytted
in Oxford in a College wherof the sayd Doctor London was Master,
and certain plate by one of the said College was taken away &amp; brought
to London to sell, and it was solde to a Goldsmyth in London named
Willyam Calaway.Willyam Calaway. This Goldsmyth had before bought muche plate
of the partye (which now solde the sayde stollen plate) beynge a man of
credyte, and therfore suspected nothynge. But this matter was so folowed,
that the partye that stole it was taken, and so was dyuers accessaryes.
At the last, Doctor London knowyng to whom it was solde,
and that the Goldsmyth was a man of the Newe Learnynge (as they
called hym) sware a great othe that he woulde hang hym or elles it
shoulde coste hym fyue hundreth pounde: wherevpon he caused also
the sayde Goldsmyth to be attached as accessarye, and arreigned hym
at the Sessyons holden at Newgate in London: where it was alleged
that they ought not by the lawe to enquyre of the accessarye before the
principall: and there for the dispatche of the sayde Goldsmyth, it was
alleged that the principall was hanged, whiche was nothynge so, for
he was set at his lybertye and lyueth styll. But to be shorte, the Goldsmyth
(which vndoubtedly is a knowen, tryed and proued honest man
and euer was of honest name and fame) was founde gyltye, and no remedy
but he must declare what he coulde say why he should not dye accordyng
to the law: he prayed to haue his booke: which was answered
that he coulde not haue it, for he was Bigamus. And now cometh the
Periury that I promised to tell you of: His wyfe, which of all persōs
that knoweth her, is certaynly knowen to be an honest woman, and frō
her byrth hathe euer ben of as muche honesty as any woman maye be:
And this woman had had two husbands before, which also were honest
men, and she had children by them, and therfore was it alleged against
this Goldsmyth that he was Bigamus: This good woman perceyuyng
that her former mariages shoulde shorten her husbands dayes,
came into the open Courte before the Iudges and affyrmed by her
othe contrarye to the truthe, that she was neuer maryed to mo men
then to the sayde Goldsmyth, althoughe she had chyldren by her other
husbandes and contynued dyuers yeres with theim, yet she sware she
was Whore to them bothe and not maryed. And so by defamyng of her
selfe, to her great prayse, she delyuered her innocent husband.
               In this yeare was in London a great death of the Pestilence, and
therfore Myghelmas Tearme was adiourned to Saynt Albons, and
there was kepte to the ende.
               In the weke of Christmas, came to the Kyng to Hampton Courte

golden plate, &amp; .iiii.M.iii. oz in gylte plate, which al was very curiously
wrought. And all the tyme that he lay here, he lay at the Kynges cost.
               The sonday before Christmas was Lorde Willyam Parre, brother
to the Queene, which had maryed the doughter &amp; heyre of Lord Henry
Burchier Erle of Essex, at Hampton Courte, created Erle of Essex. And
syr Willyam Parre Knyght vncle to them bothe, was made Lord Par
of Horton &amp; chaumberleyn to the Queene. And on Newyeres day was
Syr Thomas Wriothesley the Kynges Secretary made Lorde Wriothesley

                     THIS YERE the Kyng sent a gret army into Scotlande
by sea, and he made the Erle of Hertfford Lieutenaunt
Generall of the same. And the Uicount Lisle
hygh Admirall, whiche valyaunt Capitaynes so sped
them, that the thyrd day of Maie the Lorde Admirall
arryued with all his Flcete which was two hundreth
sayle in the Fryth, where he landed dyuers of his men
and there tooke dyuers vesselles whiche after dyd hyghe seruyce. And
shortly they approched vnto the towne of Lyth where they landed their
men, and marched forwarde in three great batteyles, wherof my Lorde
Admyrall led the vawarde, the Erle of Shrewsbury the arrerewarde,
and the Noble Earle of Hertforde beyng Lieutenaunt, the battayle:
Where they founde the Scottes assembled to the nombre of syre thousande
horsemen beside footemen to stop the passage of the army. And at
the fyrst the Scottes made towarde the Englyshmen as thoughe they
would haue set on the vaward, but when thei perceiued the Englyshmē
so willynge to encountre with theym, namely the Cardinall who was
there present, which perceyued the deuocion the Englyshmen had to see
his holynesse, after certayne shot on bothe sydes, they made a sodayne
retreate, and leauyng their artillary behynde them fled towarde Edenborough.
The fyrst man that fled was the Cardinall lyke a valyaunt
Champion, and with hym the Gouernour, the Erle of Huntley, Murrey
and Bothwell, with manye other great men of the Realme. And
shortly after the Englishmen mauger al the Scottes might do, entered
the towne of Lith wher that night the army encamped them,Lyth ta

Scotland,
               
                  The next day the Armie went towardes Edenborough toune, and
whē thei approched nere, the prouost of the toune accōpanied with one
or two Burgesses, and two or thre officers at armes desired to speake
with the kynges liuetenaunt, and in the name of al the toune saied, that
the keies of the toune shoulde be deliuered vnto his lordship condicionally,
that thei might go with bag &amp; baggage &amp; the toune to be saued
from fire: Wherunto aunswer was made by thesaid lorde lieutenaun

that wher as the Scottes had so manifestly broken there promises confirmed
by othes and Seales and certefied by the whole parliament as
is euidetly knowen to the whole worlde, he was sent thether by the kynges
highnes to take vengeaunce of there detestable falsehed, to declare
and shewe the force of his highnes sworde to all suche as shoulde make
any resistence vnto his graces power sent theither for that purpose: And

would put them to the sword and ther toune to the fire. The prouost answered
that it wer better for them to stād to ther defēce. Whereupon cō

                  ber
of the men of warre, that were strong and galaunt, that came out of
the toune, were of horsemen .lxvii. of footemen .xv.C.lxiii. of Gonners
viii.C. of hurte menne lxxxvii: of women and children .xix.C.xxvii. So
there was in all that came out of the toune, foure thousande, foure hundred
fiftie and foure, beside a greate nomber of aged, sicke and hurt persones,
that was not able to go furthe of the toune. The last persone that
came furthe, was Monsire de Ueruine, graund capitain of the Toune,
which when he approched nere the place, where the kyng stode, he alighted
from his horse, and came to the Kyng. And after he had talked with
hym a space, the kyng toke hym by the hand, and he reuerently knelyng
vpon his knees, kissed his hande, and afterwarde mounted vpon his
horse and so departed.

before hym, by the Lorde Marques Dorset, like a noble and valiaunt
conqueror rode into Bullein, and all the Trompetters standyng on the
walles of the toune

                  , sounded their Trompettes, at the tyme of his enteryng,
to the greate comfort of all the kynges true subiectes, thesame beholdyng.
And in the enteryng, there met hym the duke of Suffolke, and
deliuered vnto hym the keyes of the toune, and so he roade toward his
lodgyng, whiche was prepared for hym, on the South side of the toune.
And within twoo daies after, the kyng rode aboute all the toune, within
the walles, and then commaunded that our Lady Churche of Bullein,
should be defaced and plucked doune, where he appoynted a Mount to
be made, for the greate force and strength of the toune.
               When the kyng had set all thynges there in suche ordre, as to his wisedome
was thought best, he returned, to the greate reioysyng of all his
louyng subiectes.
               In the meane ceason, that the kyng laie before Bullein, and was like
to haue cōquered thesame, as at the last he did, as before you haue hard,
the Emperor tooke a peace with the Frenche kyng, to the no litle grefe
and displeasure of the Kynges maiestie, and that was the cause that the
kyng so sodainly brake vp his armie, aswel at Bullein as also at Muttrell,
and so he returned.
               Shortly after, beside diuerse and many sharpe skirmishes, made by
the Frenchemen at Bullein aswell by the Dolphin with a greate power

thei slewe. Howbeit so manfully the Englishmen, whiche escaped out of
Base Bullein, behaued theimselfes, gettyng weapons out of the high
toune, that thei bet the Frenchemen again out of the Base toune, and after
with the helpe of the high toune, thei slewe a greate nomber of theim,

there to haue buylded a Forte. But the fourthe daie of February,
he was set vpō in his awne campe, by the moste valiaunt and fortunate
Erle of Hertford, and Lorde Lisle, the Lorde Gray and other: at whose

to the hauen of Bullem, and skirmished with thengl

                  shemen,
to the no greate gain of the Frenchmen: but this armie whiche
was accōpted to the nomber of .xx M. there encamped, &amp; began
again to build a Fort, whiche before thei departed, accōplished thesame.
               In Iune the lorde Lisle Admirall of Englande, with thenglishe flete
entered the mouthe of the riuer of Sain, and came before Newe hauen,
where the greate armie of Fraunce laie, whiche wer CC. saile of shippes
and .xxvi. Galies of force, wherof the Bishop of Rome had sent .xx. well
furnished with men and money, to aide the Frenche kyng. Thenglishemen
beyng but an .C.lx. saile, and all greate shippes, did not determyne
to set on the whole nauie, but shot certain peces of ordinaunce at theim,
whiche caused the Galies to come abrode, and shot at the Englishemen,
whiche Galies had greate aduauntage, by reason of the calme wether:
twise eche part assauted other with ordinaunce, but sodainly the wynde
rose so greate, that the Galies could not indure the rage of the seas: and
thenglishemen wer compelled to entre the main seas, for feare of flattes,
and so sailed vnto Portesmouthe, where the Kyng then laie, for he had
knowlege by his espialles, that the Frēche army, entended to land in the
esle of Wight, wherfore he repaired to that cost, to se his realme defēded.
               After the departyng of thenglishe nauy, from New hauen, the Admirall
of Fraunce, called the Lorde Donibalt, a man of greate experience,
halsed vp his sailes, and with his whole nauie, came to the poynt of the
Isle of Wight, called. S. Helenes poynt, and there in good ordre cast their
Ankers, and sent .xvi. of his Galies daily, to the very hauen of Portesmouthe.
Thenglishe nauie liyng in the hauen, made theim prest and set
out towardes thē, and still the one shot at the other. But one daie aboue
all other, the whole nauie of the Englishmen made out, and purposed to
set on the Frenchmen: but in their settyng forward, a goodly ship of England,
called the Mary Rose, was by to muche foly, drouned in the middest
of the hauen, for she was laden with muche ordinaūce, and the portes
left open, whiche were very lowe, and the greate ordinaunce vnbreched,
so that when the ship should turne, the water entered, and sodainly
she sanke. In her was sir George Carewe knight, Capitain of thesaied
shippe, and foure hundred men, and muche ordinaunce.
               
                  At thesame tyme certain of the Frenche menne, landed in the Isle of
Wight, where their capitain was slain and many other, and were bothe
to their greate losse and pain, driuen again to their Galies.
               The kyng perceiuyng the great nauie of the Frenchmen to approche
sent letters for men into Hampshire, Somerset shire, Wilshire, and diuerse
other places adioynyng: whiche repaired to his presence in greate
nombers, well furnished with armure and victaill, and all thynges necessary,
so that the Isle was garnished, and all the frontiers on the Scacoast,
furnished with men in greate nomber.
               The Frenche capitaines hauyng knowlege, by certain Fisher menne
whiche thei toke, that the kyng was present, and also of the great power
that he had in readines, thei disancted and sailed along the coastes of
Sussex, and a small nomber of them landed in Sussex, whiche neuer returned
to their shippes, for thei were taken vp by the waie.
               When thei had searched all the costes, &amp; saw men euer redy to receiue
them, thei turned the sterne, and returned home again, without any acte
worthie to be writtē

their newe Forte against Bullein, was strongly furnished and finished.

otherwise, for the kyng hymself made hym answere, as foloweth woorde

vsed, very eloquently and substancially, to make answere to suche oracions,
as hath been set furth in this high courte of Parliament, yet is he
not so able to open and set furthe my mynd and meanyng, and the secretes
of my hart, in so plain and ample maner, as I my self am and can do:
wherfore I takyng vpon me, to answere your eloquent oracion master
Speaker, saie, that where you, in the name of our welbeloued commons
hath both praised &amp; extolled me, for the notable qualities, that you haue
conceiued to be in me, I moste hartely thanke you al, that you haue put

me in remembraunce of my dutie, whiche is to endeuor my self to obtein
and get suche excellent qualities, and necessary vertues, as a Prince or
gouernor, should or ought to haue, of whiche giftes I recognise my self,
bothe bare and barrein: but of suche small qualities, as God hath endued
me withall, I rendre to his goodnes my moste humble thākes, entendyng
with all my witte and diligence, to get and acquire to me suche
notable vertues, and princely qualities, as you haue alleged to be incorporate
in my persone: These thankes for your louyng admonicion and
good counsaill firste remembred, I eftsones thanke you again, because
that you consideryng our greate charges (not for our pleasure, but for
your defence, not for our gain, but to our greate cost) whiche we haue lately
susteined, aswell in defence of our and your enemies, as for the conquest
of that fortresse, whiche was to this realme, moste displeasaunt and
noysome, &amp; shalbe by Goddes grace hereafter, to our nacion moste proffitable
and pleasaunt, haue frely of your awne myndes, graunted to vs
a certain subsedy, here in an act specified, whiche verely we take in good
part, regardyng more your kyndnes, then the proffite thereof, as he that
setteth more by your louyng hartes, then by your substaūce Beside this
hartie kyndnes, I cannot a litle reioyse whē I consider, the perfite trust
and sure cōfidence, whiche you haue put in me, as men hauyng vndoubted
hope, and vnfeined belefe in my good dooynges, and iust procedynges
for you, without my desire or request, haue committed to myne ordre
and disposicion all Chauntreyes, Colleges, Hospitalles, and other
places specefied in a certain act, firmely trustyng that I wil ordre them
to the glory of God, and the proffite of the common wealth. Surely if I
contrary to your expectacion, should suffre the ministers of the Churche
to decaie, or learnyng (whiche is so great a iuell) to be minished, or poore
and miserable people, to be vnrelieued, you might say that Ibeyng put
in so speciall a trust, as I am in this cace, were no trustie frende to you,
nor charitable man to mine euen christian, neither a louer of the publike
wealth, nor yet one that feared God, to whom accompt must be rendered
of all our doynges. Doubt not I praie you, but your expectacion shalbe
serued, more Godly and goodly then you will wishe or desire, as hereafter
you shall plainly perceiue.
                  Now, sithence I find suche kyndenes, on your part toward me, I can
not chose, but loue and fauor you▪ affirmyng that no prince in the world,
more fauoreth his subiectes, then I do you, nor no subiectes or commōs
more loue and obaye, their souereigne lorde, then I perceiue you do me,
for whose defēce my treasure shall not be hidden, nor if necessitie require
my persone shall not bee vnaduentured: yet although I with you, and
you with me, be in this perfect loue and concord, this frendly amitie can
not continue, except bothe you my lordes temporall, and you my lordes
spirituall, and you my louyng subiectes, studie and take pain to amend
one thyng, whiche surely is amisse, and farre out of ordre, to the whiche I
moste hartely require you, whiche is, that charitie and concord is not emongest

amongest you, but discord and dissenciō, beareth rule in euery place. S.
Paule saieth to the Corinthians, in the .xiii. Chapiter, Charitie is gentle
Charitie is not enuious, Charitie is not proude, and so furth in thesaid
Chapiter: Beholde then what loue and Charitie is emongest you, when
the one calleth the other, Hereticke and Anabaptist, and he calleth hym
again Papist, Ypocrite, and Pharisey. Be these tokens of charitie emō
                     gest
you? Are these the signes of fraternall loue betwene you? No, no, I
assure you, that this lacke of Charitie emongest your selfes, will bee the
hynderaunce and asswagyng, of the feruent loue betwene vs, as I said
before, except this wound be salued, and clerely made whole. I must nedes
iudge the faute and occasion of this discorde, to bee partly by negligence,
of you the fathers &amp; preachers of the spiritualtie. For if I knowe
a man whiche liueth in adultery, I muste iudge hym a lecherous and a
carnall persone: If I se a man boast and bragg hymself, I cannot but
deme hym a proude manne. I se and here daily that you of the Clergie
preache one against another, teache one contrary to another inueigh one
against another, without Charitie or discreciō. Some to be stiffe in their
old Mumpsimus, other be to busy and curious, in their newe Sumpsimus.
Thus all men almoste be in varietie and discord, and fewe or none
preache truly and sincerely the woorde of God, accordyng as thei ought
to do. Shall I now iudge you charitable persones doyng this? No, no,
I cannot so do: alas how can the poore soules liue in concord, when you
preachers sow emonges them in your sermons, debate and discord? Of
you thei loke for light, and you bryng them to darckenes. Amende these
crymes I exhorte you, and set furth Goddes worde, bothe by true preachyng,
and good example geuyng, or els I whom God hath appoynted
his Uicare, and high minister here, will se these diuisions extinct, and
these enormities corrected, accordyng to my very duetie, or els I am an
vnproffitable seruaunte, and vntrue officer.
                  Although as I saie, the spirituall men be in some faute, that charitie
is not kept emongest you, yet you of the temporaltie, bee not cleane and
vnspotted of malice and enuie, for you rayle on Bishoppes, speake slaū
                     derously
of Priestes, and rebuke and taunte Preachers, bothe contrary
to good ordre, and Christian f
                        •
                     aternitie. If you knowe surely that a bishop
or preacher, erreth or teacheth peruerse doctryne, come and declare
it to some of our Counsaill or to vs, to whom is committed by God the
high aucthoritie to reforme and ordre such causes and behauiours: and
bee not Iudges your selfes, of your awne phantasticall opinions, and
vain exposicions, for in suche high causes ye maie lightly erre. And although
you be permitted to reade holy scripture, and to haue the worde
of God in your mother toungue, you must vnderstande that it is licensed
you so to doo, onely to informe your awne conscience, and to instruct
your childrē and famely, &amp; not to dispute and make scripture, a railyng
and a tauntyng stocke, against Priestes and Preachers (as many light
persones do.) I am very sory to knowe and here, how vnreuerently that

moste precious iuell the worde of God is disputed, rimed, song, and iangeled
in euery Al
                        •
                     house and Tauerne, cōtrary to the true meanyng and
doctryne of thesame. And yet I am euen asmuche sory, that the readers
of thesame, folowe it in dooyng so faintly and coldly: for of this I am
sure, that Charitie was neuer so faint emongest you, and verteous and
Godly liuyng was neuer lesse vsed, nor God hymself emongest Christians,
was neuer lesse reuerenced, honored, or serued. Therfore as I said
before, bee in Charitie one with another, like brother and brother, loue
dread and serue God (to the whiche I as your supreme hedde, and souereigne
lord, exhort and require you) &amp; then I doubt not, but that loue &amp;
league, that I spake of in the beginnyng shall neuer be dissolued or broken
betwene vs. And to the makyng of lawes, whiche be now made and
concluded, I exhort you the makers, to bee as diligent in puttyng theim
in execuciō, as you wer in makyng and furtheryng thesame, or els your
labor shalbe in vain, and your common wealthe nothyng releued. Now
to your peticion, concernyng our royall assent, to be geuen to suche actes
as hath passed bothe the houses. Thei shalbe redde openly, that ye maie
here them.
               
               Then wer thei openly redde, and to many his grace assented,
and diuerse he assented not vnto. This the kynges Oracion was to his

whiche Goldyng was a feate and hardy man. The Barcke perceiuyng
this small Craer to bee an Englisheman, shot at hym and bouged hym,
wherfore the Craer drewe streight to the greate ship, and sixe or seuen of
the men lept into the Barke. The Frenchemen lookyng ouer the boorde
at the sinkyng of the Craer, nothyng mistrustyng any thyng, that might
be doen by the Englishemen. And so it fortuned that those Englishmen,
whiche climed into the ship, founde in the ende thereof, a greate nomber
of lime pottes, whiche thei with water quenched, or rather▪ as the nature
thereof is, set them a fire, and threwe theim at the Frenchemen that were
aborde, and so blynded theim, that those fewe Englishemen that entered
the Shippe, vanquished al that wer therein, and driue them vnder hatches,
and brought the Barcke clerely awaie again into Englande.

whereof, the Uiscount Lis
                     •
                  e Admirall, with the Bishoppe of Duresme,
and diuerse lordes, and aboue an hundred gentlemen, all in Ueluet coates,
and cheynes of golde, went to Paris, and were there solemply receiued
and feasted, and shortly returned.
               After whose returne, the Admirall of Fraunce, accompaignied with
the Bishoppe of Eureux, the Erles of Naunteuile, and Uilliers, and diuerse
greate Lordes, beside twoo hundred Gentlemen well appoynted,
tooke his Galey at Depe, and hauyng in his compaignie twelue faire
Galies, well trimmed and decked, sailed into Englande, and neuer toke
lande, til he came to Grenewiche, where he was receiued by the Erles of
Essex, and Darby, the .xix. daie of August. And the next daie, he with all
his Galies, landed at the Tower Wharfe, and on all the bankes by the
water side, laie peces of ordinaunce whiche shot of, but especially the tower
of London, where was shot a terrible peale of ordinaunce. And frō
thence he rode through London, in greate triumphe, the Maior and the
craftes standyng in the stretes in good ordre, to the Bishoppes Palaice
of London, where he lodged till Bartholomew euen, on whiche daie he
was conueighed toward Hampton Courte, where in the waie the prince
hauyng with hym the Archebishoppe of Yorke, the Erles of Hertforde,
and Huntyngdon, and aboue twoo thousande horsse, mette hym and enbraced
hym, in suche lowly and honorable maner, that all the beholders
greatly reioysed, and muche marueiled at his wit and audacitie, and so
he came to the Courte, geuyng the Prince the vpper hande as he roade.
And at the vtter gate of the Courte, the Lorde Chauncellor, and all the
Kynges counsaill receiued hym, and brought hym to his lodgyng.
               On Bartholomew daie, the Kyng richely appareled, welcomed hym,
and in great triūphe went to the Chapell, where the league was sworne
and signed To tel you of the costly banquet houses, that wer buylt, and
of the great banquettes, the costly Maskes, the liberall huntynges that
were shewed to hym, you would muche maruell, and skant beleue. But
of Fridaie folowyng, he beyng rewarded with a Cupborde of plate, to
the valure of twelue hundred pounde, returned to London, and on Sō
                  daie
tooke his Galies and departed. Beside this diuerse of his compainie,
had muche plate, and many horsses, and Greyhoundes geuen them.
Also the Admirall had geuen to hym, of the citee of London, twoo Flagons
gilte, and twoo parcell gilte, to the somme of an hundred and sixe
and thirtie pounde, beside Wine, Waxe, and Torches: and thus thei laden
with more riches then thei brought, returned into Fraunce.
               Although this peace pleased, bothe the Englishe and the Frenche nacions,
yet surely bothe mistrusted, the continuaunce of thesame, consideryng

the old Prouerbe, that the iye seeth, the harte rueth, for the Frenche
men still longed for Bullein, and the Englishemen mynded not to geue
it ouer: in so muche as duryng the Admiralles of Fraūce beyng in Englande,
the capitain of the newe Fortresse, began to make a Pile, euen at
the very hauen mouthe of Bullein: but the Lorde Gray capitain there,
put awaie the woorke men, and tooke awaie their tooles, and filled the
trenches, to the Frenchemennes greate displeasure. And after the Frenche
kyng caused vpon a greate pain, that all the Trenches and new inuencions,
should bee caste doune, and filled by his awne people, least he
should seme to be the breaker of the peace.
               In this yere was arreigned, condempned and burned, for affirmyng
opinions, contrary to the sixe Articles, foure persones, that is to saie,
Anne Askew Gentlewoman,
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   Ihon Lacelles a gentleman, Nicholas
Otterden Prieste, and Ihon Adlam a Taylor: all these
wer burned in Smithfelde, the .xvi. daie of Iuly: and because
the whole processe of their matters, is by diuerse
writers sette furthe, therefore I passe it ouer.
In Ianuary wer attainted of high treason,
Thomas duke of Norffolke,
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   and
Henry his sonne erle of Surrey
whiche Erle was behedded
at the Tower Hill.
               Now approched to this noble Kyng, that whiche is by God decreed,
and appoynted to all menne, for at this ceason in the monethe of Ianuary,
he yelded his spirit to almightie God, and departed this world
and lieth buried at Wynsore.
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   And the laste daie of Ianuary
was his true, lawfull and onely sonne Prince Edward,
Proclaimed Kyng, of al his fathers dominions,
and the .xix. daie of February,
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   was crouned
and annoynted Kyng of this realme,
whom Iesu preserue, long
to reigne ouer vs.
