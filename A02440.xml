            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

neighbour Countries: yet still desirous of nouelties, haue not
stucke to trauell as farre as India to fetch a Dulce venenum,
a graecian Helen, an insatiate Messaline, and hugge a
stinging serpent in their bosomes: nor am I ignorant, that
to the wiser sort this treatise will seeme at the first a fruitlesse
labour, of an idle braine, and to other some a vaine florish
of a carping minde: And that beecause in this treatise is vtterly
reprehended and in some sort refuted, that which of many
excellent &amp; learned men hath beene most highly commended,
and by sundry persons of high estate hath beene experimented
and tryed verie commodious for the health of man.
            For Monardus in his treatise of the West Indian simples,
Carolus Clusius in his Comment vpon Garcaeas de
Stirpibus et Aromaticis Indicis, and Baptista Porta in
his 8. booke and 11. Chap: of Naturall Magick doe commend
this plant as a thing most excellent and diuine.
            And in these our daies many excellent Phisitions and men
of singuler learning and practise, together with many gentlemen
and some of great accompt, doe by their daily vse and
custome in drinking of Tabacco, giue great credit and authoritie
to the same: yet neuerthelesse if it shall please them

then on his demonstrations and proofes, to yeeld to their assertions.
            But of all heresies in Philosophie that Pithagoricall precept
(Ipse dixit) seemeth most grose, hurtfull, and pernitious: Heerevpon wee finde that Aristotle in his Morals
thought it not a matter of wisedome or worth commendacion,
to content himselfe with the bare authoritie of his Maister
Plato (who no doubt was in learning most excellent:

                  pocrates, (for so may I terme him, for from
him he had his light:) &amp; of set purpose in his Comments
on Hippocrates Epidemicks, and Aphorismes doth refute
him: And Aristotle had wont to say, Amicus Plato,

sed Magis amica veritas. Plato was his friend, (for from
him hee had his learning and knowledge) but Truth and Veritie
was his greater friend, and therfore in equitie &amp; right
hee ought rather to take hir part.
            So for truth sake onely did Varro write against Lelius,
Sulpitius against Casselius, Saint Ierome against Hilaris,
Saint Augustine against Hierome and Ambrose also.
These men made euer more accompt and estimation of veritie
and truth, then of the authoritie of learning in any whosoeuer.
            Let it not therefore (good Reader) seeme a vaine thing
to you, or an argument of an Idle braine, for mee to discent
in iudgement of Tabacco, from those authors before aleaged,
hauing as I suppose, both sollide Reasons and true Experience
on my side to counterpease their authorities founded
rather on opinion then any certaine science or demonstration.

            FOR the dislike that I haue conceiued in the vse and practise
of Tabacco, I take it to be grounded on eight principall
reasons and arguments.
            
               1 First, that in their vse or custome, no methode of order
is obserued. Diuersitie and distinction of persons, tymes
and seasons considered, no varietie of accidents and diseases
pondered.
               2 Secondly, for that it is in qualitie and complexion more hot
and drye then may be conueniently vsed dayly of any man:
much lesse of the hot and cholericque constitution.
               3 Thirdly, for that it is experimented and tryed to be a most
strong and violent purge.
               4 Fourthly, for that it withereth and drieth vp naturall moisture
in our bodies, therby causing sterrilitie and barrennesse:
In which respect it seemeth an enemie to the continuaunce
and propagacion of mankinde.
               5 Fiftly, for that it decayeth and dissipateh naturall heate, that
kindly warmeth in vs, and thereby is cause of crudities and
rewmes, occasions of infinit maladies.
               6 Sixtly, for that this herb or rather weed, seemeth not voide
of venome and poison, and thereby seemeth an enemie to the
lyfe of men.
               7 Seauenthly, for that the first author and finder hereof was
the Diuell, and the first practisers of the same were the Diuells
Priests, and therefore not to be vsed of vs Christians.
               8 Last of all, because it is a great augmentor of all sorts of melancholie
in our bodies, a humor fit to prepare our bodies to
receaue the prestigations and hellish illusions and impressions
of the Diuell himselfe: in so much that many Phisitions
and learned men doe hold this humour to be the verie seate
of the Diuell in bodies possessed.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            ¶A Warning for
Tabcconists.
            
               The first Reason.
               
                  TOuching the first; Where no method
or order is vsed, ther resteth
in all artes and other actions humaine,
naught else but dissolation
and confusion, a thing, as in
the Common weale it is pernicious,
so in the preseruation of
mans health it hath been alwaies
adiudged most dangerous.
               But that in these our daies, in this land of England,
this new come simple of the West commonly knowne
with vs by the name of Tabacco: is without all method
and order of most men receiued, may be apparant by
this, that it is taken early in the morning, and also very
late at night: in the morning fasting, and in the euening
feasting and on a full stomacke. In the beginning, middle,
and ende of meales. To be short, at all times, at all
houres, and of all persons, this Indian stranger most familiarly
is receiued: for the smoake of Tabacco seemeth
to the fauorits thereof at no time vnseasonable. Neither
that it ought to bee tied to reasons and rules (being
perhaps a thing in it selfe more irregular and vnreasonable)
seeing that by experience (as they thinck)
they haue found great good &amp; profit by the vse therof.
               They boast much of this their experience as a sufficient

ground for this their disorder. But their experience
not grounded on reason, but rather repugnant
thereto, and contrary to commonsence also, is a motiue
sufficient for the simple, but no way an argument
for the wiser sort, to daunce after their vnsauory and
vnpleasant Tabacco pipe.
               
               
                  Galen in his Comment on his first booke of Hippocrates
Aphorismes:

                     o. Hip. 1. Lib. 1. sheweth that the art of Phisicke standeth
on two legges, Reason and Experience: Whereof
if either bee wanting, the whole art is lame and maimed.
               For as Reason without Experience is very vncertaine:Experiment

so is Experience without Reason very perillous and dangeroes;
especially in matters inwardly to be taken and
receiued into mens bodies, the which as they are diuers
and differing in nature and complection, so are
they also diuersly in diet to bee ordered, and by farre
contrary medicines in their sicknesses cured.
               
                  For Example.
               
               
                   The diet conuenient for youth, is no waies agreeable
to old age: neither is that diet which is appropriat
to elder yeeres, any way profitable to youthfull
and growing age.
               And bodies of temper dry, require things in nature
and qualitie moist. But moist complections and maladies
growing of superfluities of humours, are more
commonly remedied by things of nature drying and
disiccatiue.Contrari

their health, and yet can it not be iustly inferred heere
of, that Tabacco simply taken without respect of times,
persons, sexe, age, temperament and disease, any waies
to be either profitable or else commendable.
               Also fasting and abstinence for meate is assigned 
by Hippocrates in his Aphorismes, for a good remedie against
full and repleat bodies.

purging and euacuation, as the bodies of wrestlers, &amp;
such as are come to the top and extreame height of fulnesse,
of whom Hippocrates speaketh of in his 3. Aphorisme
of his booke.

               Vnde fit vt corpus confestim soluere possit,
quo poterit rursus conuenienter alt.
               And yet the same author in his Aphorismes doth testifie,
purges no way to bee conuenient for sound and

healthie bodies: for saith hee,
Sana corpora difficulter purgantia medicamenta
ferunt, et cito a purgantibus exoluuntur.
               
               And to be short, neither one nor the other remedy
can in any respect preuaile, if it be applied out of his
due time and season: for,
Temporibus medicina valet,Ouid▪
                      data tempore prosunt,
et data non apto tempore vina nocent.
               
               And truely as no one kinde of diet can fit all sorts of
bodies: So no one kinde of remedie can aptly be applied
to all maladies, no more then one shooe can wel
serue all mens feete.
               What reason therfore haue these Tabacconists (I pray
you) to offer this their Tabacco after one and the selfe
same order to all men, ages, and complections indifferently,
making no scruple of the fitnesse of time, quality
of the disease, or temperament of the person to
whom they offer it.
               What thing can be more absurd and phantasticall,
then to minister one &amp; the selfe same remedy to contrary
&amp; repugnant affects, hot &amp; cold, dry and moist,
emptie and repleat, acute and cronicall, which for the
more part haue deeper rootes, and are of longer continuance,
then can sodenly be blowne away with a puffe
of a smokie Tabacco pipe, yea &amp; some of them can hardly
be remoued by the great paynes, care &amp; cunning of
the expert and learned in Phisicke: for,
Nonest in medico semper releuetur vt aeger
Interdum docta plus valet arte malum.
               
               And yet these Tabacco

                     •
                  rits hold no disease so incurable
but that in some measure it receiueth either

cure or ease by this Tabacco.
               
               But I assure you many diseases being of themselues
and their owne nature, light and of easie cure, may by
the vntimely vse of this same, become altogether incurable,
such are, the first step or degree to an Heticke, distemper
of heat in the Liuer, oppilations of the Lungs,
and such like.
               And truely if nothing else should make one out of
fancie with the vse of Tabacco, it might be suffi
                     •
                  ient for
an equall iudge to thinck with himself how vnnaturall
a thing it is to peruert the naturall vse &amp; offices of the
parts of the bodie, for by the force of Tabacco the
mouth, throte, and stomacke, (appointed by nature for
the receipt of food &amp; nourishment for the whole body)
are made emunctuary clensing places and sincks,
(supplying heerein the office of the most abiect and
basest part) for the filth and superfluous excrements of
the whole body.
            
            
               The second Reason.
               
                  THe second reason against the ordinarie
vse of Tabacco, is taken from the excesse
of his two manifest qualities of heat
and dri'th, which Monardus and others
also haue affirmed to come neere to the
third degree of excesse in either qualitie.
               So that if men of hot and dry constitution should
often vse the feume of Tabacco, no doubt they should
increase much their distemper, for like added to his
like, increaseth the resemblance &amp; similitude the more

according to that Axiome in Philosophie.
                  Arist. 
                        〈◊〉
                     . 
                  Omnes unile additum
simili reddia ipsum magis simile. Whervpon Aristotle
in his 8. booke and 29. Chap.Arist. lib 8. Cap 29. De animal. De animalibus, inferreth, that a Snake if he eate of a Scorpion waxeth farre
more venemous then he was before.
               But I neede not to stand long vpon this point, seeing
that daily practise &amp; experience teachth vs, that heat
increaseth heat, &amp; things cold, do increase in vs a greaer
cold, the like may bee said of the other qualities of
dri'th and moisture, so that in natural reason and common
sence it seemeth true that the extreame &amp; violent
dri'th &amp; heat of Tabacco, maketh it far vnfit &amp; vnwholsome
for thin &amp; cholericke bodies. And so is it also for
youth and such as grow, for Qui crescunt plurimum habent
innaticaloris, this naturall heat in youth, by the immoderate
vse of this fierie fume would soone turne
vnto a heat vnnaturall, and thereby be occasion of infinite
maladies.
               But I hold it a thing very dangerous, not onely for
the yonger sort, but also for all other ages and constitutions
whatsoeuer, to bee ouer bold with Tabacco. For
it doth not onely consume and dissipate naturall heat
in them (by increasing of the vnnaturall) but it wasteth
also &amp; drieth vp radicall moisture (the principall
subiect of natiue heat) so that heereof insueth in the
bodie great store of crud &amp; vndigested humours, the
effects of immoderate heat in vs.
               For it is not fierie nor immoderate heat in vs, but
rather a milde &amp; vnctuous warmth, consisting in a temtperate
&amp; moderate moisture that performeth as well
concoction as all other naturall actions in vs.
               
                  Which thing is very apparant &amp; conspicuous in such
as are afflicted with hot &amp; burning Feuers: In whom
as the fierie heat appeareth most, so crude and vndigested
humours doe abound more then in such as are
cleare of such extremitie of heates. Neither doe their
humors at any time come to perfect digestion in them,
vntill the rigor and violence of that fierie heate be in
some sort (by cooling diet and medicine) repressed.
               Much lesse therefore are the patrons of Tabacco to
bee beeleeued in this, that hot and burning Agues (
                     •
                  ising
of corruption and putrefaction of choler &amp; blood
in the veines or about the principall parts of mans bodie)
may bee cured with an in
                     •
                  usion of Tabacco lease
in white Wine steeped all night.
               For as it was euer an aphorisme &amp; maxime in Phisicke,
that as like is maintayned by his like, So was it
also of like certaintie in the same art, that Contr
                        •
                     ria a

I meane contrary rather to the disease, or to
the cause of the disease.
               But what contrarietie I pray you can be found betweene
Tabacco and a Feuer tercian or burning Ague:
When as they mani
                     •
                  estly agree in their principall qualities
of heate and dri'th: both equally falling in excesse
of either of them? The like may be said of other
effects proceeding of the same of like causes.
               But to let the diseased passe, and to come to those
which are of perfect health, I take it very dangerous
and hurtfull for them often to vse this 
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                  
for therby great part of that humour is dissipa

                  d, wasted,
spent &amp; cast foorth of the body by often

                  ,

seeges, swets and continnall spittings and coughings,
which in processe of time would turne to good blood,
and holsome nurrishment for the bodie.
               For Crude and watrish humors (which for the most
part are all those which by this medicine are) are
oftentimes very necessary for many vses in the body:
As for pliant motion of the loints, and principally for
nurrishment of the flegmaticke and colder parts.
               And it is a receiued opinion amongst the best Phisitions
that nature (being a prouident &amp; carefull nurce of
mankinde) hath purposely left this Crudie humour in
our bodyes, to the intent that we might euer haue
some thing in store to nourish vs, if happely we should
at any time want other foode.
               But that no small part of our nurishment is drawne
away by the vntimely vse of this Tabacco,
                  Tabacco depriueth the b
                        •
                     dy of nourishment. may manifestly
appeare by those men, who before the vse thereof
were grose and foggy, but after they haue acquainted
themselues with this kinde of practise, they became very
leane and s
                     •
                  lender.
               So that no doubt, if they desist not in time from farther
vse therof, ther is no small suspition least that they
shall therby fall into Consumptions, &amp; to that of the most
dangerous sorts called of the Phisition, Marasmos proceding
of want of substanciall nurrishment, &amp; dissipation
of naturall heat and decay of spirits in the body.
               And heerein I cannot but wonder much at the ouer
sight of some, who otherwise being learned and wise,
yet in this seeme very Paradoxicall, when as they contend
to proue Tabacco to be a great nurrisher. For beesides
that, it is manifest that it taketh away great part of

our nurrishment, by the extreame euacuation it procureth,
it is also (by meanes of his great heat &amp; drynesse)
very vnapt to breed any good nurishment in vs▪
               
               To this may bee added, his vnpleasaunt and vngratefull
smell, insomuch that the tasters thereof
beare away with them in their bodyes and breath,
the loathsome Tabacco sent, long time after.
               So that it is very euident and manifest that as well in
respect of his substance (ouer hot &amp; dry) as also of his
vnpleasing &amp; stinking sent, it is neither fit to nurish the
humerall &amp; solide parts, nor yet apt to refresh &amp; comfort
the spirits of man, be they naturall in the Liuer, vitall
in the hart, or sensible or animall in the braine and
sinewes. For as touching the humours in vs, they are
aptest nourished by such things as are either humorall
and mo
                     •
                  st, or else, may easely bee turned and conuerted
into a liquid and thin substance.
               And as for the hard and solede parts of the body▪ as
bones, sinewes, vaines &amp; artires) they cannot receiue
any nutriment of any thing before it bee first turned
into some moist and liquid substance also, apt to be 
                     •
                  uked
&amp; drunck into the former parts, &amp; afterward by the
force of natures worke, assimulated, hardened, &amp; transformed
into the very nature &amp; substance of the parts
by it nurished. But as for the spirits, it hath ben a question
much disputed on amongst the Philosophers, (as
Aristotle, Plato, and others) of old time, &amp; their expositers
since; whether smels or odours may any wayes
nourish the same. And (if I be not deceiued) they all
agree in this, that mens spirits doe feele great comfort
and refreshing by such sweet and pleasant sauours as

are founded &amp; subiected in some moyst &amp; vnctuous
matter. But this priuiledge cannot in any respect bee
graunted to Tabacco, both for that hir sauour is very vnsauorie
&amp; stincking, &amp; also because it is placed &amp; founded
in a very dry and withered substance. Insomuch
as that the t

fit to bee taken, vntill it bee thoroughly parched and
dryed, that thereby it might the better receiue the
force of the fire, &amp; the sooner be kindled therwith.

therof should any waies offend or loath their braine.
               But to come to our Tabacco,
                  Tabacco vngratefull in sent. if any man doubt of his
ill sauour &amp; bad sent, I refer him to the report of those,
who haue had longest tryall therof. No doubt, except
they be altogether shamelesse, they will truely informe
him therof. I remember that being called once to the
cure of an honorable Earle now departed this life, amongst
other learned and expert Phisitions,
                  D. T. there
hapned one to be called, who as in times past he was
Chimicall, so in the vntimely vse of this plant he seemed
to bee ouer fantasticall. It fortuned the very morning
that he came vnto his Honors presence, he had (according
to his accustomed wont) taken his mornings
draft of Tabacco, with the fume wherof, he so perfumed
his Lordships bedchamber in such sort, as that the
Earle being meruaylous anoyed therwith, told me after
the departure of the former Phisition, that from
thence foorth hee had rather lose the benefit of that
mans counsell in Phisicke, then to indure such a horrible

a fume againe. This good D. being demaunded of
other Phisitions, (wherof two were hir Maiesties) thē
present, what reason he had for this his custome? answered
that he would not but for 100 pounds he had
vsed this feume at first, for thereby he found great ease
for his cold reumatick &amp; stomacke. But now said he, I
would that I could so easely leaue it, condicionallie I
had giuen 300 pounds more, for I finde my selfe hart
sick that day, till I haue tasted thereof.
               No doubt the long and dailie vse of drincking Tabacco,
had accustomed his stomack to draw to it watrish
and rewmetick matter in great aboundance, the quantitie
wherof, vrged nature to seeke meanes for the expelling
the same againe, which could, by no other
thing be more fitly performed then by Tabacco it selfe.
               For as it hath a powre &amp; faculty to draw to the stomacke,
(as other strong purges haue) so likewise hath
it a property and vertue to expell forth the same, no otherwise
then all other purges haue. But heerein it differeth
from other purges, that it seemeth to be of a far
more thin &amp; subtile nature then other purges bee, by
meanes wherof, nature is so pricked and forced oftentimes
in such violent sort, as that it causeth violent euacuation,
as well by stoole vomits and swetes, as also
by saliuacion, coughing &amp; spittings, which thing other
purges vsually doe not, albeit they be very forceable,
violent and strong.
               So that heereof is gathered the fourth reason beefore
aleadged, that Tabacco is not familiarly to be vsed
beecause it is a vehement and violent purge.
            
            
               
               The third Reason.
               
                  I Neede not stand long on this
point,Tabacco a violent
purge. to proue Tabacco to bee a
strong and violent purge: for that
in daily practise &amp; common experience
the same is most euidēt
and manifest to most men. And
to doubt of that which of it selfe
is perspicuous, were grose stupiditie, and to denie that
which is to our sence most cleere and euident, were
a point next to extreame folly.
               The often scowrings, fluxes, vomets, swetes, and
other immoderate euacuations in
                     •
                  ident to this simple,
doe testifie the same to purge most violently.
               Furthermore, Tabacco is found to be of that strēgth
&amp; force, that the verie maceration or infusion of one
leafe thereof in white wine ouernight doth procure
strong and extreame vomits.
               It is as yet fresh in memorie, that diuers yong
Gentlemen, by the daylie vse of this Tabacco, haue
brought themselues to flixes and disenteries, and of
late at Bath a Scholler of some good accompt and
worshipfull calling,D. B. was supposed to haue perished
by this practise, for his humours beeing sharpened
and made thin by the frequent vse of Tabacco, after
that they had once taken a course downward, they
ran in such violence, as that by no Art or Phisicks
skill they could be stayed, till the man most miserably
ended his life, being then in the verie prime and vigour

of his age.
               But no purge, (be he familiar or gentle, or else violent
and hurtfull) ought by the rules of Phisicke to
bee familiarly and daily vsed of any man that hath respect
either of his life, or regard to his health.
               For as concerning such as are in perfect health Hippocrat
                        •
                     
                  
the Prince of Phisitions in the 36.Hip. lib 2. Apho. 36. 
                  Aphorisme of
his second booke affirmeth: Corpora 
                        〈◊〉
                      si per medicamenta
purgantur exoluuntur celeriter; &amp; quae prauo cibo
vtuntur. Sound and healthie bodies (sayth he) soone
wast and consume, by the vse of purging medicines.
In like case doe they which feede on corrupt and vnwholesome
meates.
               Likewise the same author in the 37.Hip. lib. 2. Apho 37. 
                  Aphorisme of
the former booke, sayth, that Qui corpora habent commoderata
ijs purgationes difficiles sunt. To such as are in
health purging medicines are very dangerous. And
truely this his assertion seemeth to be grounded vpon
good &amp; substanciall reason. For wheras the vertue and
operacion of the purge is to draw &amp; expell foorth of
the body such corrupt &amp; vnholsome humours as haue
any affinitie or likenesse in substance with the purge; &amp;
in healthy bodyes finding none of that disposition &amp;
nature, the purge then either loseth his operation and
action, &amp; therby is conuerted into some bad humour
in the bodie, or else it draweth and expelleth foorth
humours very profitable &amp; necessary for the nurrishment
and sustentation of the body. And therefore
all purges must needes bee to sound and healthy bodyes
very perillous and dangerous.
               
                  And as for sicke and diseased men, they ought onely
to vse purging remedies at such times as their bodies
and humours shall be made fit and apt for the operatiō
of the purge, according to that counsell of Hippocrates
in his tenth Aphorisme of his second booke, saying:
Purganti quoties vacuas medicamine corpus,
quo bene res Cedat, fluxile redde prius.
               
               So often as thou purgest,Hip. Apho. 1
                        •
                     . lib. so often also ought you
to make your bodies apt thereto, and the humours (to
be purged) fluxible, that the parts and passages of the
body being open, and the humours apt to runne, the
purgation might worke with lesse torments and griefe
to the partie purged.
               So that it seemeth very apparant true, that neither
in health, nor yet in sicknesse, that so vntimely and vulgar
vse of Tabacco (beeing before prooued a violent
purge) can be vsed without great hurt and danger.
               Neither ought this kind of remedie to be giuen at
anytime, but in causes of extremitie, and in desperate
diseases onely. For that it is an extreame and desperate
medicine.Hip. Apho. 6. lib 1. 
                  Extremis enim morbis extrema remedia adhibē
                     dasunt,
saith our Hippocrates. And in his comment vpon
the same Aphorisme, sheweth all strong purges to be
reckoned amongst extreame remedies.
            
            
               The fourth Reason.
               
                  THe fourth argumēt against this newcome
simple, was that it drieth vp
and withereth our vnctuous and radicall
moisture in vs, and therby seemeth
an vtter enemie to the continuance
and propagation of mankinde.
This may be prooued in this sort.
               
                  That thing which depriueth the body of norishmēt
and foode, doth also wither &amp; dry vp our naturall and
radical moisture; (because this hath his refreshing and
sustentation from the purest part of the blood ingendred
of our nourishments). But Tabacco was shewed
before to depriue vs our norishment, in that it spendeth
and euacuateth out of vs by spitting and sweats
&amp; otherwise much of that matter that in time would
proue in vs good blood &amp; good foode for our bodies.
And therefore Tabacco must needs be said to be a great
decaier and witherer of our radicall moysture before
specified.
               Moreouer Tabacco by meanes of his great heat and
immeasurable drinesse, dissipateth naturall heate and
kinde warm'th in our bodies, and thereby is cause of
defect of good concoction &amp; perfect disgestion in vs.
The humors therfore in vs by this meanes made crude
and rawe, can be no fit aliment or nutriment for the
vnctuous and substantiall humiditie, wherin with moderate
and kindly heate the Philosopher esteemed the
life of man to consist.
               And last of all, wheras the sperme &amp; seed of man, is
supposed (by the Phisitians &amp; natural Philosophers also)
to be framed of the purest &amp; finest part of his blood
by the actiō &amp; vertue of kindly warm'th working therin;
the blood being now vndigested &amp; crude, and the
naturall heate peruerted &amp; corrupted by the immoderate
vse of this hellish smoake, reeking foorth of Plutoes
forge, what sperme or seed shall we expect to come frō
them that daily vse or rather shamefully abuse this so
apparant an enemy to the propagation therof, as wel if
you respect the materiall cause of seed consisting in the

perfect
                     •
                  st &amp; most concocted parts of the blood) as his
efficiēt (resting in the moderatiō of naturall heat) both
greatly altered and decayed by the vse of Tabacco.
               
               Hereby it must needs in cōsequent follow, that the
continuation &amp; propagation of mankinde (consisting
principally in his perfect &amp; vncorrupt seed) is in these
men much abridged.
               And for certaine proofe that Tabacco dryeth vp the
sperme &amp; seed of man, I heare by faithfull relation of
such as haue much vsed it; That whereas before the vse
thereof, they had bene long molested with a fluxe of
seed, cōmonly called with vs the running of the reines,
and of the Phisitian Gomorrhaea, (proceeding in them
by reason of great quantitie &amp; abundance of that matterseeking
vent forth of the bodie) they were in short
space eased of this affect by the onely vse of this medicine.
For no doubt, this fierie fume, dried vp the superfluitie
of that matter, which by reason of her thin and
great quantitie, easily dropped from them. But if they
persist ouer long in the practise therof, no doubt more
of that spermaticall humiditie wil be dried vp in them,
the will be conuenient for their health, or for the increase
of their like; wherby the propogatiō &amp; cōtinuation
of mankind in this world must need be abridged.
            
            
               The fift Reason.
               
                  THe fift argument against Tabacco
was, that it dissipateth naturall heate,
and thereby was occasion of rawe
and vndigested humours in the bodie.
               This thing in part hath bene demōstrated
before in the chap. precedent,

to which may here be added, that where naturall
and kind heat is by any meane made more violent and
fiery, there the parts of the body are made more hard
and dried, and thereby the more vnfit and vnapt to
drinke or receiue into them such liquid and moist matter,
as by the daily foode should accrue and grow to
them. Wherevpon it falleth forth, that that humiditie
that should bee conuerted into the nature &amp; substance
of the sollide parts, is made (by meanes of their not admission
thereof) excrementall and superfluous.
               For it is not a thing either strange or absurd in Philosophie,
that things of qualitie drie, may by an accidentall
meanes, be cause of superfluous moisture. We
see this thing confirmed by Galen himself, in his second
booke and second Chapter, De tempera mentis,
                  Galē. lib. 
                        •
                     . de Temp. cap. 2. and also
by Auicen.
               
               We see by experience, that old persons being naturally
drie in their sollide parts, and haue for that cause,
their skin parched, their faces withered, their sinewes
f
                     •
                  iffe, their backes stouping, and yet who doubteth but
such persons haue in their intrailes and inward parts,
great store of flegmaticke and excrementall moistures,
proceeding of want of good digestian and concoction
in those parts.
               And truly those superfluities do the more abound
in them, for that their firme and sollide parts (as Sinewes,
Bones, &amp; Flesh, Veines, Artiers, and Ligamēts)
are too drie and hard to receiue and sucke vp so much
of that alimentall humour which Nature dooth daily
send to them for their sustenance and reliefe.
               And hereof is seene in daily experience, that olde
folk are troubled most with rewmes, Catarres, coughs,

spatterings, vomits, scourings, and such like.
               And that old age is naturally drie and hard, Galen
declareth in these words: Senum temperies sicca est,
                  Lib. 
                        •
                     . De tempora. cap. 
                        •
                     . 
                  pro exemplo sunt arbores, N
                        •
                     quoties senescunt magis exiccantur.
               
               We see also that the earth in Haruest time being ouer
dried and parched with the heate of the Sommers
Sunne, cannot so speedily suck and drinke vp such sudden
showres of raine, as at that time most vsually doo
happen.
               And therefore about that time of the yeare we see
the greatest land flouds to appeare, and most harmes
to happen to men by losse of their Hey carried away
thereby.
               All which proceedeth by reason of the great siccetie
and dri'th of the earth at that season, causing it to be far
vnapt to receiue that sudden moisture flowing on the
face thereof.
               In like case the firme and sollide parts of mans body,
being ouer drie and hardned by the long and continuall
vse of Tabacco, do with the more difficultie receiue
and imbybe into them the alimentall humiditie
before specified: and therfore they remaine more copious
in the body.
            
            
               The sixt Reason.
               
                  THe sixt Reason against Tabacco was,
that this Plant seemeth not voyd of suspition
of a venemous and poysoned nature,
and therefore ought not so carelesly
or confiden
                     •
                  y to be vsed.
               The venemous and poisoned substance and nature
of Tabacco, is manifested and prooued by this, that it
is daily experimented, and before was prooued by vs,

to be a violent and most forceable purge.
               
                  Galen in his second booke De ratione virtus, and 12.
Section,
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   holdeth for a certaintie that all vehement and
violent purges, haue in them some deliterious &amp; poysoned
nature, &amp; a facultie or operation cleane contrary
to the nature of man.
               And in the sixt of his Epidenickes, the same Galen
affirmeth, that in times past purging medicines were
esteemed deliterious, for that they (being taken in any
large quantitie) were offensiue to nature, destroying
and wasting the same.
               In good Authors I finde three kinds of deliterious
 medicines. The one in manifest qualitie, either excessiue
hote, as Calcanthum, or else extreame cold (as Mandrake)
or Opium.
               
               
                   Of the second sort, are those which by their owne
poysoned nature and substance, be deadly offensiue to
the takers therof, and they being receiued but in small
dose or quantitie, kill and poyson the takers thereof.
Such are venemous musrumps, Napellum, Taxicum,
and such like.
               
                   Of the third kind of deliterious and deadly medicines,
be such, as are by reason of their vehemēt &amp; violent
euacuation, most daungerous and perillous, if in
any large quantitie they be assumed. Such be Enphorbium,
praecipitate, Eleterium, and Tabacco it selfe.
               Which last as it is deliterious by violent euacuation, So
it is also very pernicious and hurtfull in his manifest and
euident qualities of extreame dry'th and heate included
therein.
               
               But touching his violent euacuation and purging
qualitie, it hath bene sufficiently shewed before. This

one thing may be added therevnto, that Tabacco is in
this respect more perillous, for that it is taken without
due preparation and correction.
               For it is confessed of all Phisitians,Io. Mesnes cap. de 
                        〈◊〉
                     . that euery purging
medicine if it be strong (in respect of the deliterious
&amp; bad qualitie it hath) ought to be artificially corrected
before it be takē, leas
                     •
                   he communicate his bad
and venemous nature, to the stomack &amp; inward parts.
               Herevpon it is a vsuall custome in Phisicke, to mixe
with purges, Mastich, Cloues, Cinamome, Ginger,
Aniseeds, Nutmegs, and such like sweete and aramaticall
Spices, partly to take away the vngratefull sent of
the purge, and partly to defend the vitall spirits, &amp; principall
parts, from the malice and hurt which otherwise
would happen by the ill qualitie of the purge.
               Out of this rule of preparation of purges, onely
Aloes Succotrine is by Mesnes excepted. Which as hee affirmeth)
is so farre from ill qualitie and deliterious nature,
as that it is commonly giuen with other purges to
amend &amp; correct their venemous &amp; malitious nature.
               But what correctiues I pray you in our time and
Countrey are there vsed in this Indian Tabacco, which
the more simple &amp; sincere it is, the more holsome and
effectuall it is adiudged to be? And if it haue by any
meanes any aramaticall spices shufled amongst it, it is
straight reiected and condemned for naught &amp; counterfeit.
               I denie not but that since Hippocratus and Mesnes
time, there haue beene found out sundrie purges by
the latter Arabians, which for that they worke gently
and without offence, are called of them, Benedicta Medicamenta:
Blessed and safe medicines, and therefore

haue need of no preparation to be vsed with them for
their correction. Such are thought to be Manna of Calabria,
Camarinds, Cassia of Rhubarbe. But this Tabacco
(now in vse) is of an other keye, and no waies to be accounted
Benedictum in working, but rather diabolicall
and hellish: for that it worketh with extremitie, torments
and griefe.
               And that it is also in substance and nature deliterious
and venemous,Tabacco in his nature poison. may be gathered by the symtornes
and accidents which doo immediately follow and ensue
the large drinking therof. That are, violent vomits,
many and infinite stooles, great gnawings and torments
in the guts and inward parts. Coldnesse in the

cold sweats, ill colour, and wannesse of skinne,
defect of feeling, sence, &amp; vnderstanding, losse of sight,
giddinesse of the head and braine, profound and deep
sleepe, faintnesse, sounding, and to some hastie and
vntimely death. All which, or the most part of them
concurring, do manifest a poisoned qualitie or venemous
nature in the thing receiued.
               And it is the more daungerous for that it hath in it
the effects of contrary and repuguant poisons:Tabacco a double poison for albeit
it be in qualitie very hotte &amp; drie, yet hath it a stupifying
and benumming effect, not much vnlike to
Opium or Henbane: which ere held to be colde in the
extreamest degree. And albeit, it be apt to suffocate or
strangle like to Gipsum or playster of Parrise, yet doth
it purge &amp; scoure as violently as Precipatate or Quick-siluer
sublymed.
               I cannot resemble the poysoned force of this Tabacco
to any thing more aptly, then to the venome of a

Scorpion,Tabacco like the poyson of a Scorpion▪ D

Scorpion it selfe, bruised or annointed on the place
stung. In like case the venemous impression left in the
stomacke by Tabacco, receiueth no ease by any thing
else whatsoeuer, but by Tabacco onely, eftsoone reiterated
and resumed. This onely difference seemeth to
be betweene these two poysons, That the venome of
the Scorpion hath his perfect and absolute cure from
the Scorpion it selfe, but that of Tabacco hath onely a

                     •
                  taine ease and paliation for a time by the fume of
Tabacco receiued; but after perfect and absolute cure,
this Tabacco by it selfe a thousand times resumed or reiterated,
admitteth none.
               Neither do I take it of great importance which is by
some alleaged;Custome is of great force. That many here in England do take the
fume of Tabacco without hurt or inconuenience, and
without any such strange accidents following. For the
custome of taking Tabacco with vs, is in that maner, as
that, it neither profiteth, nor yet hurteth much.
               For what great inconuenience (I pray you) can
happen to the taker thereof,Euery Agent requireth time conuenient to worke his effect. when as he receiuing it at
the mouth, doth straightway puffe it forth againe, or
snuffeth it out at his nostrels, before it can haue sufficient
time and space, to imprint his malicious and venemous
qualitie in their bodies?
               Fewe or none do take it downe their throates,If the Agent lack due quā
                     titie, he los

such as let it passe down, they mince it in such sort, and
swallow it in so small quantitie, as that no great detriment
can happen to them thereby.
               But if happily any, more audacious then circumspect,
shall let downe any large quantitie thereof, then
shal you euidently perceiue in him, most of those accidents

before specified.
               I am not ignorant that many perillous and deadly
poysons are sometimes taken into the body without
offence and daunger, but then they are either in very
small quantitie (as I spake before) or else so repressed
and corrected with other Cordialls,Poisons sometime may bee taken without o

                     fence. as that they cannot
offend, but sometimes they bring great commoditie
and profit with them.
               
                  For example, the flesh of Vipers in Treacle is so tempered
and corrected, that it profiteth much to such as orderly reciue
it, against any poyson or contagion whatsoeuer. And
quick-siluer well mortified, is often giuen, &amp; inwardly
taken, against many infirmities, with good successe.
               So in like maner we denie not but that in smal quantitie
Tabacco may be taken of any men without peril or
imminent danger, &amp; especially being corrected &amp; purified
by the force of the fire wherewith it is ministred.
               For that fire sometimes doth represse the poisoned
vapour of venemous things,Fire correcteth poison. may be prooued by the
testimony of Seneca, who (in his 2. booke of his natural
questions,Seneca. lib. 2. nat. quest. cap. 31. and 31. Chapter, going about to shewe the
reason why that poisoned and venemous beasts do neuer
engender wormes within them, vntill such time as
they be first striken with lightning) saith, that wormes
are engendred of humours apt to receiue life. But
such be farre differing from such as are of a venemous
or poisoned disposition or nature, for they are altogether
aduersaries and enemies to life. This poisoned
and venemous nature in Serpents (once striken with
lightning) is in them wasted, dissipated &amp; dispearced,
by meanes of the fire in the lightning, and the humors
remaining after in them, beeing freed frō venome and

poison, may the more aptly be conuerted into things
bearing life, and to wormes themselues.
               It may also be assigned out of Mercurialis for an other
reason,Hieronimus Mercurialis ll. 1. de veneni
                        •
                     . why wormes are not engendered in poisoned
serpents, because that wormes haue their originall
from vndigested and crudie humours in the body: But
Serpents haue no such in them: for all their humours be well
and perfectly digested. Which may well bee gathered by
the fragrant and sweete smell, and pleasant smell and
sent, which breathing from their bodies, is left behind
in those places where they vsually haunt.
               But here may be obiected,Obiection. that if Tabacco were of
that poysoned nature (as wee haue affirmed) then no
doubt, the Indians (who vsually drinke it) should haue
long since bin poisoned therewith. But hitherto they

                     •
                  aue found no such hurt, but rather great commoditie
and manifest benefit thereby. As appeareth by Monardus
in his Treatise of Tabacco.
               
               To this may be answered,Answere. that the oddes and diuersitie
of their bodies and humours from ours, may alter
much the case. Or else, that long custome and familiar
vse of this Tabacco from their infancie, hath confirmed
their bodies, to suffer &amp; endure the same without hurt
or offence: for custome altereth nature.
               In like case I read in Galen in his 3.Galen lib. 3. de simpl med. cap. 18. booke of simples,
and 18. Chap. of a certain old woman that nourished
her selfe long season with poisoned Hemlockes By litle
and litle (saith he) shee accustomed nature thereto, that at
length, this poyson became familiar to her, and no way offensiue,
but rathe
                        •
                      nourishing to her body.
               
               
                  Auicen also in his Treatise de Viribus Cordis, alleaging
Rufus an auncient Phisitian for his authour, reporteth

that there was a yong maid, who being fed &amp; norished
long time with poyson, liued her self in perfect health.
And yet with her venemous breath she poysoned and
infected all other persons that came neare to the same.
               
                  Plynie in his 7.Plyn, booke &amp; 2. chap. of his naturall history.Aul. Gel.
And Aulue Gellius, noct. attic. 16. cap. 11. And Siluius
Italicus in 8.Saluius. 
                  lib. doo all testifie that in times past there
were certain people in Italy (Marsitians by name)Italicus. who
vsually handled and sold, yea and fed on also the flesh
of Vipers. Which of all Serpents are accounted most
malignant and venemous.
               And Virgil in his 7.Virgil. 
                  Aeneid. faineth those people to
be the ofspring of Circes,
                  Aeneid 7. and that they had a naturall
gift giuen them by her, to tame &amp; enchaunt that kind
of Serpent: and also to qualifie &amp; delay the venemous
and poysoned nature thereof.
               Of these men Galen maketh mentiō in his 11.Galen▪
                   booke
of simple medicines, where he cōfesseth, that being at
Rome, he inquired diligently of those people (tearmed
Marsi) of the nature &amp; qualitie of vipers, and how they
differed from the other Serpent called Dipsas. Because
(saith he) they were expert and cunning in them.
               So that it is manifest &amp; apparant by the testimonies
before rehearsed,Custome is an other nature. that custome may alter &amp; change nature
and the qualitie of things, according to that vsuall
Cōsuetud
                        •
                      alter an naturā. Custom changeth nature, &amp; at
lēgth turneth into nature it self; for it is an other nature.
               The like is seene in the East Indies, where the Turkes
familiarly vse Opium in large quantitie, which to vs but
in very small dose is experimented to be manifest poyson:
onely long vse &amp; familiar practise hath made this
vnconuenient for their bodies.
               
                  And so no doubt if our countrey men from their
infancie had by litle and litle vsed to take this Tabacco
fume or other poyson whatsoeuer, they should haue
had as litle cause to feare the daunger thereof, as the
Turkes haue of their Opium, or the old Marsitians had
of Vipers, or the West Indians haue of their Tabacco.
But for want of that Custome, it fareth with vs in that
sort, that if we take any great quantitie of the Opium
before specified, we shall rather die on the sudden, or
else fall into that kinde of dead sleepe, as that we shall
by no other meanes then by the Arch-angels trumpet
(sounding at the latter day) be awakened thereout.
               To this may be added a secret vertue and specificall
qualitie giuen the Indians by nature, whereby they
are not ouercome by this kinde of poyson, as other
Nations be. For Sextus Empericus
                  Sextus Empericus. reporteth in the like
case, that one Attienagoras Argivus had a gift giuen by
nature euen from his birth, that hee could bee hurt by
no venemous Beast or Serpent whatsoeuer. And that
certaine people of Aethiopia did naturally feed &amp; nourish
themselues with the flesh of Scorpions.
               But we Englishmē may not safely presume that this
specifical
                     •
                   vertue &amp; hidden qualitie doth abide or lurk
in vs, seeing that by far weaker poisons then these, we
sustaine infinit perils, and often incurre death it selfe.
               Wherefore we haue the lesse cause to venture on
things in reason suspected to be of a venemous &amp; poysoned
qualitie, because forsoothe the Indians doo it
without offence.
               Neither is it of any great waight or moment which
is alleadged of the Tabacco patrons for her commendation,
that Marriners and Sea-faring men, neuer

found any remedie so forceable against the Scuruie
and other diseases of like nature, commonly incident
to that kinde of people (by meanes of the foggy ayre
in the Sea, and their vnholsome diet) then is the fume
of Tabacco.
               
               The reason of this profit in Marriners may bee,
because their bodies after long lying on the Seas, are
filled and stuffed with badde and corrupt humours,
on the which the force and power of Tabacco dooth
worke, drawing and purging them forth of the body,
no otherwise then other strong purges expell and
purge forth such corrupt humours as haue any similitude
or likenesse to themselues.
               But as strong purges taken of sound and holsome
bodies (as I shewed you before) be very perillous and
dangerous: So truly is Tabacco, being taken of such as
are cleare and voyd of such impure and corrupt matter,
which to the Marriners is most familiar and
vsuall.
               The like is seene of other poysons, which when
they find any of their owne qualitie &amp; nature in mans
body, or that hath any likenesse or similitude to them,
they drawe forth the same (the like coue
                     •
                  ing his like)
and leaue the sound and healthy humours cleare and
vnspotted.
               But when no such poisoned matter is found in the
bodie, then dooth the poyson or venome receiued,
worke on the good humours, vtterly corrupting and
destroying them. So that it is apparant that sometime
venomes (to venemous and poysoned persons) may
be profitable &amp; medicinable. But to sound &amp; healthy

bodies they can neuer happen without danger.
            
            
               The seuenth Reason.
               
                  THe seuenth reason against Tabacco
was, that this hearbe seemed to bee
first found out and inuented by the
diuell, and first vsed and practised by
the diuels priests, and therfore not to
be vsed of vs Christians.
               That the diuell was the first author
hereof, Monardus in his Treatise of Tabacco dooth
sufficiently witnesse, saying. The Indian Priests (who
no doubt were instruments of the diuell whom they
serue) doo euer before they answere to questions propounded
to them by their Princes, drinke of this Tabacco
fume, with the vigour and strength wherof, they
fall suddenly to the ground, as dead men, remaining
so, according to the quantitie of the smoake that they
had taken. And when the hearbe had done his
worke, they reuiue and wake, giuing answeres according
to the visions and illusions which they saw whilst
they were wrapt in that order.
               And they interpreted their demaunds as to them
seemed best, or as the diuell had counselled them, giuing
cōtinual doubtful answers, in such sort, that howsoeuer
they fell out, they might turne it to their purpose,
like vnto the Oracle of Apollo. As
Aio te Aeacide Romanos vincere posse.
               
               Which might be vnderstood, that either he might
ouerthrow the Romanes, or that the Romanes might
ouercome him.
               
                  But yet in more plaine words, the same Monardus
                        •
                     
                  
litle after declareth the Diuell to bee the author of
Tabacco, and of the knowledge thereof, saying: And
as the Diuell is a deceiuer, and hath the knowledge
of the vertue of hearbes; so hee did shewe them the
vertue of this hearbe, by meanes whereof they might
see the imaginations and Visions that hee representeth
vnto them, and by that meanes dooth deceiue
them.
               Wherfore in mine opinion this practise is the more
to be eschued of vs Christians, who follow &amp; professe
Christ as the onely veritie and truth, and detest and abhorre
the diuell, as a lyar and deceiuer of mankinde.
            
            
               The eight and last Reason.
               
                  THe last, and that not the least argument
against Tabacco, was that it is a
great encreaser of melancholy in vs,
and thereby disposeth our bodies to
all melancholy impressions and effects
proceeding of that humour.
               
                  Galen in his second booke of temperaments
and 3. Chapter,Galen. lib. 2. de
                        •
                     empera. cap. 3. defineth Melancholy to
be the very sediment and dregges of bloud; which is
so farre thicker &amp; colder then bloud, as yeallow choller
is held to be thinner and hotter then the same.
               And this melancholy humour is said to bee of two
sorts: the one naturall, the other vnnaturall.
               The naturall is that thicke part of the bloud before
rehearsed. The vnnaturall is not the sediment or

grounds of good bloud, but rather a certain burnt and
parched matter rising of the adustian and scorching of
the other humors, that is, of phlegme, yealow choller,
and of the former sediment of pure bloud, which we
termed naturall melancholy.
               And albeit it seemeth very vnlike that phlegme (being
of nature cold and moist) may be any adustian be
turned into swoart and blacke choller; yet in qualitie
and disposition that humour doth often represent and
resemble melancholy it selfe. And therefore Galen holdeth
sometimes melancholy to bee ingendered of
phlegmy ouer-hardned and dried.
               The contrarietie and diuersitie of these vnnaturall
melancholies, doth hang and depend on the contrarietie
and difference of the humours whereof they bee
engendered.
               All these sorts of melancholies are augmented and
encreased much in such as often accustome themselues
to the fume of Tabacco.
               
               For first, touching the natural melancholy, it is manifest
that the thicker and grosser that the bloud is, the
more of that thicke and earthly sediment it shall containe.
But Tabacco thickeneth and engrosseth the
bloud, and therefore Tabacco engendereth in vs a
greater store of that thicke and grosse sediment which
wee defined to bee of Galen called naturall melancholy.
               The Maior or first Proposition is manifest, for all
liquid and moist things are the more thicke, or thinne,
and cleare, according to the quantitie of the grounds
and feces mixed in the same. For if the groundes

                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
be many, then is the matter or humor troublesome
and thicke. But if the dregges or feces be fewe, then
is the humor cleare and thin.
               The Minor or second Proposition of the former
Sillogisme, may be proued in this sort. All those things
which waste and consume the purest &amp; thinnest parts
of the blood, doo cause the same blood to remaine afterward
more grosse and thicke, and therfore may iustly
be said to thicken the blood.
               But Tabacco wasteth and absumeth the liquid and
thin part of our blood, and therfore Tabacco may iustly
be said to thicken the same. The Maior Proposition
being euident, needeth no farther proofe.
               The Minor is prooued by daily and vsuall practise
and experience of such as commonly doo drinke this
Tabacco. For thereby doo they purge great store of a
cleare and thin humour, which would mixe it selfe
with the blood, and cause the same to be more liquid
and fluent, and in time also (by good Concoction)
turne into pure and subtile blood, apt to feede and norish
the bodie.
               And albeit melancholy (being of nature cold) seemeth
to haue no need of phlegmetique and thin humours
to be mixed therewith (least that his colde distemper
be greatly increased thereby): yet of necessitie
some store of this crude and rawe matter is required
to runne with the melancholy Iuice, to moderate
and temper his extreame siccetie and drythe, and to
defend it from Induration &amp; hardnesse. The increase
whereof in our bodies, breedeth dulnesse, sottishnesse,
and blockishnesse. All which are the vsuall effects of

ouer-hardened and dryed melancholie.
               For melancholy ouer-hardened, if it come once
to be cooled, it is extreame cold as Iron. Which being
heat, is extreame hotte; and being cooled againe,
is extreame cold also.
               So this hard and drie melancholy once depriued
of naturall heate by the inordinate vse of Tabacco
fewme (the fierie heate of the one dissipating the naturall
and lesser heate of the other) can yeeld nothing
else but the effects of an excessiue and immoderate
colde cause lying in the veines, and mixed with the
blood. Such are esteemed to bee dulnesse of conceit,
blockishnesse, mopishnesse, and sottishnesse, one
of the worst kindes of accidents that commonly ensue
ouer-hardened, cooled and dryed melancholy in our
bodies.
               Againe, such as the partes of the blood be, such
also is thought the blood to bee, and as the blood
prooueth, so likewise are the spirites affected, for they
doo issue and proceed from the blood it selfe. And
such as the spirites are, such also is adiudged to be the
temper and dissipation of the heart and braine: and
as the braine is disposed and affected, so likewise are
the vertues of conceit, imagination, vnderstanding,
and remembrance, affected and disposed also. All
which in particular, by sundrie examples were easie
to prooue, for him that is but meanely seene and slenderly
read in Philosophie sayings, that the sanguine
man by meanes of the puritie of his blood, hath his
braine and inward parts well tempered, his sences
cleare, his spirites light and subtile, his heart bold and

merrie, his minde affable, curteous and ciuil. Whereas
on the contrary part, the melancholy person by reason
of the superfluous earthly and drie matter mixed
with his bloud, hath his complexion more wan and
swarte, his conceit of braine more dull and hard, his
minde giuen to sollitarinesse and priuate life. For
those two humours of bloud and melancholy, are in
both their qualities very repugnant and contrary.
The one being hotte and moyst, the other colde
and drie.
               But here me thinkes I hear you say, what maketh
this idle discourse of bloud and melancholy, of the
disposition of the braine and spirits to your purpose,
or to the reputation of Tabacco?
               
               Forsoothe very much. For heereby it appeareth
that the continuall practises of Tabacco, destroy the puritie
and clearnesse of their bloud, in that as I proo
                  
                     •
                  ed
before, it hardeneth and thickeneth the same.
And in thickening it engendereth dull &amp; melancholy
spirites, which make blockish and sottish conceits,
and a timerous and deiected mind not fit or conuenient
for man that delilghteth in ciuilitie and societie of
others. For seeing that the fewme of Tabacco yeeldeth
no good foode or nourishment to the pure blood, but
rather troubleth and corrupteth the same, it is thereby
most plaine and euident, that it ingendreth in vs most
dull and troubled spirites, also tasting and sauouring
much of that loathsome fewme and duskish smoake
which rise
                     ••
                   &amp; steemeth vp to the braine by the roofe
and pallate of the mouth, first sent thither through the
Tabacco pipe full charged with Tabacco dust, and afterward

scorched and incinerated by the extreame heate
of the parching fire.
               This darke and smoakie fume, pearsing the cauities
and ventricles of the braine, no otherwise, then a melancholy
winde or adust vapour (rising from an adust
Liuer, or obstructed splene) do breed in vs terror, and
feare, discontentment of life, false and peruerse imaginations,
and fantasies most strange, no way depending
vpon iust cause or grounds, and alwaies a melancholy
spirit, a fertfull and timerous minde. For truly the inward
darknesse and obscuritie of the braine, doth appall
and terrifie our inward sences and minde also, in
no lesse sort then doth the externall darknesse or myst
of the outward aire, terrifie &amp; apall the same.
               And if any man be farre blinded with Tabacco,
that he will not admit for true, that the vapour or fume
thereof ascending to the braine, is darke and swart of
colour, and of qualitie excessiue drie; let him but cast
his eyes on the smoake issuing forth of the nosthrils of
the Tabacconists, or to the smoakie tincture left in the
Tabacco Pipe after the receit thereof, and he shall easily
reclaime his error. This swart &amp; sottish tincture cleaueth
so fast to the inward part of the Pipe, as hardly by
any means but by the extreme heate of the fire it may
be cleared from thence. And no doubt the like impression
doth the same leaue in our braines, and in the
cauities thereof. So that the animall spirits ingendred
in those places, can no lesse but (participating thereof)
sauour of the same, no otherwise then wine put into
an vnsauorie and mustie bottle, doth euer sauour of a
mustie taste.
               
                  Neither am I any waies ignorant that Aristotle in
his Problems holdeth that melancholy doth help and
profit much to the sharpening &amp; quickning of the wit
and vnderstanding: and that melancholy persons are
deemed of him the most wisest. But this kinde of melancholy
(which Aristotle talketh of) is altogether naturall,
and no way engendreth of the Tabacco smoake.
For it is the sediment and groundes of the pure &amp; perfect
blood,Ficinu

The spirits which issue from this kinde of melancholy,
are verie light, fine and subtile, not much vnlike to the
spirits of wine well distilled, and artificially rectified:
which is by art and force of the fire drawne out of the
feces or grounds of pure wine. And the spirits rising
from this drie melancholy humor, are the thinner and
the more subtile by reason of the closenesse &amp; straightnesse
of the pores of the same matter: and they are the
more firme &amp; constant in their action, by meanes that
they issue and proceed from an humor more compacted
and close vnited.
               The subtilitie therefore and stabilitie of these spirites,
rising from such a naturall melancholy, doeth
much further the sharpning of the wit and vnderstanding
of man.
               But the like cannot be expected of the spirites rising
of that kinde of melancholy which is engendred
by the abuse of Tabacco. For this sort of melancholy
humor is neither bright &amp; shining like to molten gold,
nor yet the grounds of pure and perfect blood, but rather
an earthly and adust matter, not much vnlike

stoncole or scorched earth. So that the spirites issuing
from it must needs be of a diuers and farre contrarie
qualitie and nature.
               Last of all, melancholy being of nature cold and
drie, had in reason need of some thin and liquid humor
to be mixed therewith, to temper his extreame
siccetie and drythe: which is the qualitie of most offence
and annoyance in it. For as phlegme offendeth
most in cold, so doth melancholy falt most in drynesse.
               
                  Tabacco therefore ought in no respect to be familiarly
vsed of the melancholy person, because it is excessiue
drie, both in his manifest qualitie, and likewise by
accidentall meanes of his immoderate purging and
euacuation, by meanes whereof, great part of that liquid
and moyst matter is purged out of the body that
should retaine and keepe it in perfect state and temper.
And for that Tabacco is confessed to be hotte, almost in
the third degree of excesse, therfore his drithe and siccetie
is thereby made the more vehement, and vntollerable.
               So that it is apparant that vnnaturall melancholy,
whether it be made of adustian of bloud, choller, or
phlegmy, or else of the sediment of them, scorched
and as it were in cinerated, hath no small encrease by
the vntimely vse of this phantasticall deuice of Tabacco
smoake, leauing in our bodies a fierie impression and
drie distemper, not easily remedied.
               And therefore in my opinion all melancholy persons,
of what state or condition soeuer they bee of, and
especially Students and Schollers, ought to bee very

well aduised in the vse of so pernitious and dangerous
a thing, least that in them, naturall melancholy be conuerted
into vnnaturall, and this also, either into a corrisiue
and adust humour apt to inflame the braine, or
else into a matter so hard and drie, as that it be altogether
hurtful and offensiue to the vnctuous and radicall
moisture of the life of man: and thereby occasion a
hastie and vntimely death. For no longer can life continue,
then naturall heate bee refreshed with an ayrie
and moderate moisture included in the radicall
humour, and appointed by nature for
the reliefe and sustentation
of the same.
