            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                     But as the glasse runnes out with euerie hower,
                     Some in their youth, some in their weakest age,
                     All sure to die, but no man knowes his time.
                     By this I thinke, how vaine a thing is man,
                     Whose longest life is likened to a spar.

Soone prickes the trée that will proue a thorne, and a Girle that loues too soone, wil repent too late. What a husband? Why the Maides in Rome durst not looke at Venus temple till they were thirtie, nor went they vnmasked till they were maried; that neither their beauties might allure other, nor they glaunce their eyes on euerie wanton. I tell thée fond Girle, when Nilus ouerfloweth before his time, Aegipt is plagued with a dearth: the trées that blossom in Februarie, are nipped with the frosts in May; vntimely frutes had neuer good fortune, &amp; young Gentlewomen that are wooed and won ere they be wise, sorrow and repent before they be olde. What séest thou in Francesco, that thine eye must choose, and thy heart must fancie? Is he beautifull? Why fonde Girle, what the eye liketh at morne, it hateth at night: Loue is like a hauyn, but a blaze; and Beautie, why how can I better compare it than to the gorgeous Cedar, that is onely for show and nothing for profite; to the apples of Tantalus, that are precious in the eye, and dust in the hand; to the starre Artophilex, that is most bright, but fitteth not for anie compasse; so yong men that stand vpon their outward portraiture. I tel thée they are preiudicial: Demophon was faire, but how dealt he with Phillis? Aeneas was a braue man but a dissembler: fond girle, all are but little worth, if they be not welthie.

And what wilt thou doo with a husband that is not able to maintain thée? buy forsooth a dram of pleasure with a pound of sorrowe, and a pint of content with a whole tunne of preiudiciall displeasures? But why doo I cast stones into the aire, or breath my words into the winde; when to perswade a woman from her wil is to roll Sisiphus stone; or to hale a headstrong Girle from loue, is to tie the Furies againe in fetters.

Shall I thē tie my affection to his lands or to his liniamēts? to his riches or his qualities? are Venus altars to be filled with gold or loialty of harts? Is the Simpathie of Cupids consistorie vnited in the abundance of coyne? Or the absolute perfection of constancie? Ah Isabell, thinke this, that loue brooketh no exception of want, that where fancie displayes her coulours there alwayes eyther Plentie keepes her Court, or else Patience so tempers euery extreame, that all defectes are supplied with content. Upon this, as hauing a farther reach, and a déeper insight, she stept hastely to her standish, and writte him this answere.

                     Gentle sir, if you be as valiant as you séeme cholaricke, or as martiall as you would be thought hardie; set not vpon a weaponlesse woman, least in thinking to triumph in so meane a conquest, you be preiudicte with the taint of cowardise.

Therefore Gentleman if you be the man I take you, Isabels Francesco, leaue off your armes and fall to amours, and let your parlée in them be as short, as the night is silent, and the time dangerous. Francesco séeing it was the Paramour of his affections, let fall his sword, and caught her in his armes, readie to fall in a swound by a sodaine extasie of ioy: at last recouering his senses, he encountred her thus.

Sir (quoth she) these protestations are now bootlesse: and therefore to bee briefe, thus (and with that the teares trickled downe the vermilion of her chéeks, and she blubbred out this passion) O Francesco, thou maist sée by my attire the depth of my fancie, and in these homely roabes maist thou noate the rechlesnesse of my fortunes,

I offend nature as repugnant to my father, whose displeasure I haue purchast to please thée; I haue giuen a finall farewell to my friends, to be thy familiar; I haue lost all hope of preferment, to confirme the simpathie of both our desires: Ah Francesco, see I come thus poore in apparell, to make th

Where hee no sooner came, but fortune meaning to dally with the olde doteard, and to present him a boane to gnaw on, brought it so to passe that as he came riding downe the towne, he met Francesco and his daughter comming from the Church, which although it piercte him to the quicke, and strainde euerie s

This euidence caused the Mayor straight garded with his Officers to march downe with Fregoso to the place where Isabel and her Francesco were at breakfast, little thinking poore soules such a sharp storme should follow so quiet a calme: but fortune would haue it so. And therefore as they were carrowsing each to other in a swéete frolicke of hoped for content, the Mayor rusht in, and apprehended him of felonie; which draue the poore perplexed louers into such a dumpe, that they s

                        ood as the pictures that Perseus with his shield turnde into stones. Francesco presently with a sharpe insight entred into the cause,

and perceiued it was the drift of the olde foxe his father in lawe: wherefore he tooke it with the more patience. But Isabel séeing her new husband so handled, fell in a swownd for sorrow, which could not preuaile with the Serieants, but they conueyed him to prison, and her to the Mayors house. As soone as this was done, Fregoso as a man carelesse what should become of them in a straunge Countrey, tooke horse and rode home, hee past melancholy, and these remained sorrowfull, especially Isabel: who after shee had almost blubbred out her eyes for griefe, fell at length into this passion.
                     Infortunate Isabel, and therefore infortunate because thy sorrowes are more than thy yeares, and thy distresse too heauie for the prime of thy youth. Are the heauens so vniust, the starres so dismal, the planets so iniurious, that they haue more contrarie oppositions than fauourable aspects? that their influence doth infuse more preiudice than they cā inferre profite? Then no doubt if their motions be so maligne, Saturne conspiring with all his balefull signes, calculated the hower of thy birth full of disaster accidents. Ah Isabel, thou maist sée the birds that are hatched in Winter, are nipt with euerie storme; such as flie against the Sunne are either scorched or blinded; &amp; those that repugne again nature, are euer crost by fortune. Thy father foresaw these euills, and warned thée by experience; thou reiectedst his counsaile, and therefore art bitten with repentaunce: such as looke not before they leape, ofte fall into the ditch; and they that scorne their parents, cannot auoyd punishment. The yong Tygers followe the braying of their olde sire, the tender Fawnes choose their foode by the olde Bucke: These brute beasts and without reason stray not from the limits of nature; thou a woman and endued with reason, art therefore thus sorrowfull, because thou hast been vnnaturall.
                     Whether now Isabel? What, like the shrubbes of India parched with euerie storme? Wilt thou resemble the

brookes of Caruia, that drie vp with euerie Sunne-shine? Shall one blast of Fortune blemish all thy affection? one frown of thy father infringe thy loue toward thy husband? Wilt thou bee so inconstant at the first, that hast promised to bee loyal euer? If thou béest daunted on thy marriage day, thou wilt be fléeting hereafter.

At last, as he was in this pleasing suppose, he remembred his swéete Isabel, whose beautie and vertue was once so precious, that betwéen his old loue, and his new fancie, he fell into these passions. Ah Francesco, whether art thou caried with new conceits? shal thy fruites be more subiects to the Northern blasts, than thy blossomes? shal thy middle age be more ful of folly, than thy tender yeres? wilt thou loue in thy youth, and lust when thy dayes are halfe spent? Men say, that the Cedar, the elder it is, the straighter it growes; that Narcissus flowers the higher they spring, the more glorious is their hiew: and so shoulde Gentlemen as they excéede in yeres excell in vertues: but thou Francesco are like to the Halciones, which being hatcht white as milke, grow to be as blacke as Ieat?; the yong storkes haue a musical voyce,

What leaue to loue Isabel, whose beautie is deuine, whose vertues rare, whose chastitie loyall, whose constancie vntainted? And for whom? for the loue of some vnknowen Curtizan. Consider this Francesco, Isabel for thy sake hath left her parents, forsaken her friends, reiected the world, and was content rather to brook pouertie with thée, than possesse wealth with her father. Is shee not faire to content thine eye, vertuous to allure thy minde? nay, is she not thy wife, to whom thou art bound by lawe, loue, and conscience: and yet wilt thou start from her? what frō

To effect therfore the desired end of his affects, he made himselfe as neate and quaint as might be, and hied him to his newe Mistresse house, to put in practise that which himselfe had purposed; whether in the afternoone ariuing, he vnderstood by her chamber maide that she was at home and solitarie: by her therefore hee was conducted to Infidas closet, wher he found her séeming melancholy, and thus awaked her from her dumpes.
                     Fair Mistres, haile to your person, quiet to your thoghts and content to your desires. At my first comming into your chāber, séeing you sit so melancholy, I thought either Diana sate musing on the principles of her modestie, or Venus malecontent dumping on her amours; for the shewe of your vertues represents the one, &amp; the excellence of your beauties discouers the other: but at last when the glister of your beautie surpassing thē both, reflected like the pride of Phoebus on my face, I perceiued it was my good Mistres, that discontented sate in her dumpes: wherefore as your bounden seruant, if either my word or sword may frée you from these passions, I am here readie in all actions howsoeuer preiudiciall, to shew the effect of my affection. Infida glad to sée her Louer in this Laborinth; wherein to binde him sure, she taking him by the hand, made this wilie aunswere.

VVhen (right VVorshipfull) these reasons entred into my reach, and that I sawe how odious in elder time ingratefull men were to all estates and degrees; least I might be stained with such a hatefull blemish, hauing receiued many friendly, nay fatherly fauours at your

proportionate equall requitall to your deserts, so that I onely thought to make thankes my pay mistris, and so passe ouer your good turne with the old prouerb, God and Saint Francis thank you. Yet when I perceiued great men had taken little gifts, I tooke heart at grasse, and imboldened my selfe to present you with a Pamphlet of my penning, called my Nunquam sera est: which your VVorship so gratefully accepted, measuring my will more than the worth; that hauing made my second part, wherein is discoursed the sequell of Francescoes further fortunes, I thought to shrowde it vnder your patronage: I haue discouered herein the other follies of his youth, and how at last, repentance stroke in him such a remorse, that his sorrowe for his sinnes were more than the pleasures conceipted in his vanities. I haue from the loue of a lasciuious Curtizan, brought him to the VVife of his youth: the storie necessarie for yong Gentlemen, and not offensiue vnto graue eares: for the most seuere Stoick of all that seekes a knot in a rush, may herein finde some sentence woorth the marking. And though you as Virgill hold Ennius, yet you may out of his drosse gather

some golde. They which thinke there is no God to their Goddesse, may here finde that wanton loues are the readie paths to preiudice, and that effeminate follies are the efficient causes of dyre disparagement, and that there is no Iewel like the gift of an honest wife. But whatsoeuer it is, all is shrowded vnder your fauour: which hoping you will as gratefullie patronage as the former, I wish your VVorship as manie good fortunes as your self can desire, or I imagine.

To satisfie therefore al my well wishers, I haue written what befell Francesco after he had forsaken his Infida, no great aduentures, but you may see plotted downe many passions full of repentant sorrowes, and reade many of his Sonnets that hee made in remorse of minde; such as they bee they are yours, or what my pen can doo, but looke for it in more deeper matters.

                        , in a moment figuring out sorrowe with teares, and in that instant deciphering pleasure with smiles: neither too resolute with the Stoickes to yeeld to no passions, nor too absolute with the Esseni to surfet with ouer much chastitie: their desires (quoth he) resemble Aeolus forhead, that next euery storme contains a calme: their déedes are like Almanacks that decipher nothing but vncertaintie; either too scrupulous with Daphne to contemne all, or too voluptuous with Venus to desire all; and straight neither flesh nor fish as the Porpus, but time pleasers, to content themselues with varietie of fancies. In this humorous melancholie hee arose vp and raunged about the Citie, despayring of his estate as a man pennylesse, and therefore impatient because he knewe not how to redresse his miseries: to relie vppon the helpe of a Curtizan, he sawe by experience was to hang hope in the ayre: to stand vpon the fauour of friends, that was bootelesse; for he had fewe in the Citie, as being but a straunger there, and such as he had were wonne with an Apple, trencher friends,

To goe home to his wife to faire Isabel, that was as hard a censure as the sentence of death, for shame of his follies made him ashamed to shewe his face to a woman of so high desarts. In this perplexitie he passed ouer three or foure daies till his purse was cleane emptie,

his score great, and his hostesse would trust him for no more money, but

                         vp and downe as a man forlorne, hauing neither coyne nor credite. Necessitie yt stingeth vnto the quick, made him set his wits on the tenter, and to stretch his braines as high as Ela, to sée how he could recouer pence to defray his charges by any sinister meanes to salue his sorrowes: the care of his parents and of his owne honor perswaded him from making gaine by labour: he had neuer been brought vp to any mechanicall course of life. Thus euery way destitute of meanes to liue, he sight out this olde sayd sawe, Miserrimum est fuisse beatum: yet at last, as extremities search very farre, he calde to minde that he was a scholler, and that although in these daies Arte wanted honor, and learning lackt his due, yet good letters were not brought to so lowe an ebbe, but that there might some profite arise by them to procure his maintenance. In this humour he fell in amongst a companie of Players, who perswaded him to trie his wit in writing of Comedies, Tragedies, or Pastorals, and if he could performe any thing worth the stage, then they would largelie reward him for his paines. Francesco glad of this motion, seeing a meanes to mitigate ye extremitie of his wa

By this meanes his want was releeued, his credit in his hosts house, recouered his apparell in greater brauerie then it was, and his purse well lined with Crownes.

Now gentle Palmer, seeing we are fallen by course of prattle to parlie of Playes, if without offence doo me that fauour to shewe me your iudgement of Playes, Playmakers and Players.

Now, so highlie were Comedies esteemed in those daies, that men of great honor and graue account were the Actors, the Senate and the Consuls continuallie present, as auditors at all such sports, rewarding the Author with rich rewards, according to the excellencie of the Comedie. Thus continued this facultie famous, till couetousnesse crept into the qualitie, and that meane men greedie of gaines did fall to practise the acting of such Playes, and in the Theater presented their Comedies but to such onely, as rewarded them well for their paines: when thus Comedians grewe to bee mercinaries, then men of accompt left to practise such pastimes, and dis

Age is a crowne of glorie when it is adorned with righteousnesse, but the dregges of dishonor when tis mingled with mischiefe: for honourable age consisteth not in the tearme of yeares, nor is not measured by the date of a mans daies, but godlie wisedome is the gray haire, and an vndef

The Herbe grace the older it is, the ranker smell it hath: the Sea starre is most blacke being olde: the Eagle the more yeares, the more crooked is her bill; and the greater age in wicked men, the more vnrighteousnesse: which this Signor Bernardo tried true; for desire made him hate delap, and therefore within two or three nights, picking out a watch answerable to his wish, hee himselfe (as if it had béen some matter of great import) went abroade, and to colour his follie with the better shadowe, hee searched diuers houses, and at last came to the place where Isabel lay, charging the host to rise and to shewe him her chamber; for (quoth he) I must conferre with her of most secret affaires. The good man of the house obeyed willinglie, as one that held Bernardo in great reuerence, and brought him and the match to the chamber doore. Bernardo taking a

                              With the same distresse (swéete Mirimida) am I pained, who lighting by chance as Paris did in the vale of Ida vpon Venus, haue seene a brighter Danie than Venus; but I feare me lesse courteous than Venus. I haue no golden

apple (faire Nymph) to present thee with, so to prooue thée supreme of beautie; but the deuotion of my thoughts is offered humblie at thy feete, which shall euer confesse none so beauteous as Mirimida. Then as Venus for reward gaue Paris Helena, so courteous Nymph bee prodigall of thy fauours and giue me thy heart, which shall bee to me more deare than a hundred Helens.

I cannot denie (sweete Mistris) but that hot loues are like a bauins blaze, and that men can promise more in a moment than they will performe in a moneth. I knowe there was a Demophon that deceiued Phillis, an Aeneas that falsified his faith to Dido, a Theseus that forsooke his Ariadne: yet measure not all by some mens minds; of a fewe particular instances, conclude not generall axiomes; though some haue been fleeting
