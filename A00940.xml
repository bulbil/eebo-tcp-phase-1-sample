            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

A proofe heereof appeareth in the confeſſion
of that notable conuert of Tarſus in Cilicia, in
whome (his apostolicall vocation notwithſtanding)
this oppoſition was ſo effectuall,
that he acknowleged a lawe in his members, rebelling
against the lawe of his mind, and leading
him captiue vnto the lawe of ſin; wherevpon
he vttered this patheticall exclamation,
O me miſerum! Quis me à corpore mortis huius
vindicabit?
            For doubtles, there is no reaſonable creature
conſisting of ſoule and bodie, in whoſe mind
contrarie motions are not incamped, making
manie a hot skirmiſh, to amplifie and inlarge
the limits of their regiment; in ſo much that oftentimes
we ſee ſome ſoonke and ſwallowed vp

            Heerevnto are referred the good and bad
liues of men, their thoughts, words, deeds, and
whole conuerſation, honeſt or diſhoneſt: to the
controlling of a certaine Greeke prouerbe, ſuppoſed

ſentence of the vice
inſuing,
                     
                        PRIDE entereth into thee, ô man,
through ignorance, bicauſe thou knowest
not thy ſelfe. And thus doth ignorance
ingender pride; when thine owne
conceit deceiueth thee, making thee beleeue,
that thou art better than indeed
thou art. This is pride, this is the beginning
of all ſinne, when thou art greater in
thine owne eies, than thou art in Gods
ſight, than thou art in truth, &amp;c.
                     And therfore if thou wilt not be proud,
ô man, haue knowledge of thy ſelfe; ſo ſhalt
thou learne to be humble, lowlie, and
meeke. Impenitencie followeth pride. For
a proud hart waxeth hard, past feeling,
void of all godlie remorſe, and parching
drie through want of the deaw of ſpirituall
grace. We knowe that proud perſons
haue no part nor fellowſhip with the
Saints. Why then art thou proud, ô dirt

and doong?
                     God ſpared not the Angels when they
waxed proud, how much leſſe will he forbeare
thee, ô rottennes and woorms meat?
He did nothing; he wrought nothing; he
onelie conceiued pride in his mind, and
thought proudlie in his hart; wherevpon,
euen in the twinkling of an eie, he was
floong downe headlong into hell, with an
irrecouerable fall. If an angel abode ſuch
bitter puniſhment, onelie for the conceit
of pride; what ſhall become of me dust
and aſhes, the greatest part of whoſe life
hath beene ſpent in pride? He ſweld in
heauen, I in a doonghill.
                     Who will not iudge that pride is more
tollerable in a rich man, than in a begger,
and yet both are abhominable? Wo is
me, that ſo mightie a power was ſo ſharplie
plagued, for hauing an high mind and
hautie hart! What vengeanee hangeth
ouer my head, for my dailie practiſing
of pride, for my loftie lookes, and vnſufferable
nicenes? Flie from pride, my brethren,
as from a ſcorpion; &amp; imbrace humilitie,
wherewith God is much pleaſed,
whether it be in Angels or in men.

                           O
                         Man, how goodlie
a creature art
thou? How excellent?
How like to
God himſelfe, whō
thou dooeſt repreſent
as it were a ſtéele glaſſe, and of
whome thou art a liuelie image?
yea, how néere draweſt thou to
God in dignitie, ruling and gouerning
all things in earth, as he doth
in heauen?
                     The verie Scripture it ſelfe deſcribeth
and ſetteth foorth thine excellencie
in a woonderfull maner,
and ſaith that thou art little inferiour
to Angels, that thou art crowned
with glorie and worſhip, that
thou haſt dominion and lordſhip ouer
all the works of Gods hands,
that all thinges are in ſubiection
vnder thy féete, ſhéepe and oxen,
beaſts &amp; cattell, fowles and fiſhes,
and whatſoeuer elſe is contained

within the compaſſe of this wide
world. Why then ſhouldeſt thou
not glorie in this ſo ſtatelie a title
of preeminence, in this ſo great intereſt
of authoritie, in this thy diuine
prerogatiue?
                     Lift vp thy ſelfe, O man, and
thinke of this thine honour, how
notable it is, how ſingular, how vniuerſall.
Heauen aboue doth miniſter
vnto thée the ſunne giueth
thée light by daie; the moone by
night; ſea and land obeie thée; the
one for ſhipping and traffike, the other
for ploughing and tillage. To
conclude, there is nothing, but it
dooth ſeruice vnto thée, as to their
ſouereigne and léege Lord.
                     In conſideration whereof, O
man, make much of thy ſelfe. For
thou art an excellent creature: yea,
thou art péereleſſe in all points of
knowledge, wiſedome, eloquence,
and counſell; in all kinds of riches,
honour, eſtimation, &amp; poſſeſſions;
in all degrées of conſanguinitie, affinitie,
linage, &amp; deſcent: finallie, in

all other gifts of bodie, and mind.
                     Thou haſt none better than thy
ſelfe; none thy ſuperiour: none
thine equall. Thou art comelie of
perſon, amiable of face, pleaſant of
ſpeach, commendable in behauiour,
neat in apparell, and in all reſpects
péereleſſe. Thou haſt not one like
thée to be thy match; deſpiſe and
contemne euerie bodie therefore in
reſpect of thy ſelfe; giue place vnto
none, ſubmit thy ſelfe to none; but
prefer thine owne perſon before the
beſt, eſtéeming all men thine inferiours
and vnderlings.
                  
                  
                     3 A Praier againſt the
former vice.
                     O Eternall GOD, which haſt directlie
ſpoken againſt the ſwelling
ſinne of PRIDE, ſundrie times
in thy ſacred Scripture, ſaieng, that
thou doeſt deteſt and abhor it: and
haſt declared by the mouth of thy
Prophet Eſaie, that All fleſh is
graſſe, and all the pride thereof like
flowre of graſſe: we beſeech thee

roote out of our harts this moſt
ſtinking and ranke weede of wickedneſſe,
which pulleth vs from
heauen aboue, and preſſeth vs to
hell belowe.
                     O giue vs grace we beſeech thee,
to be proud of nothing that we attempt,
or accompliſh; but to aſcribe
all the glorie thereof to thy diuine
maieſtie, acknowledging that when
we haue done all that we can, euen
to the vttermoſt of our ſtrength, we
are neuertheleſſe vnprofitable ſeruants,
and haue ſcarſelie done ſo
much as we ought.
                     Guide vs we beſeech thee by thy
holie ſpirit, that we fall not into the
gulfe of this odious ſinne; leaſt the
like heauie iudgement be not onlie
denounced, but alſo executed vpon
vs, as was vpon Herod, whome thine
Angel, by thy commiſſion, did
ſmite, becauſe in the pride of his
hart he aduanced himſelfe, and
gaue not thee the glorie due vnto
thy name, inſomuch that he was
eaten vp of woormes. O Lord deliuer

vs from this defiling offence,
which woundeth the ſoule; ſo ſhall
wee, by thy grace preuenting vs,
eſcape puniſhment, through Ieſus
Chriſt our ſauiour, Amen.

ſentence of the vertue
following.
                     ALL woorthineſſe is vnwoorthie of
the verie name of woorthineſſe, if
humilitie be deſpiſed. If therefore, ô man,
thou art in authoritie, be notwithstanding
as an vnderling: if thou art a Gouernour,
yet thinke not ſcorne of ſubiection.
                     Why art thou puffed vp, ô man? why
ſwelleſt thou, why lookest thou aloft, and
beareſt thy ſelfe high without cauſe? The
Lord alone is aloft, whome thou canſt not
be like by climing. His greatnes is to be
praiſed, but not able to be followed. Be
humble, ô man, and thou haſt laid faſt
hold of him, for it is humilitie alone which
lifteth aloft, and leadeth to life. This is the
onlie waie, beſides it there is none other:

he that climeth by another ladder than
this, doth rather come tumbling downe,
than clime vp.

HVMILITIE.
                     
                        
                           O
                         Man, remember thou
art but duſt &amp; aſhes,
rottennes &amp; woorms
meat. Remember alſo,
O man, that if
thou art anie thing, except thou abaſe
&amp; humble thy ſelfe by ſo much,
as thou art aboue and better than
the reſt, thou dooeſt vtterlie looſe
whatſoeuer thou art.
                     What man! Looke vpon thy ſelfe,
art thou higher than the firſt Angel?
Art thou brighter in earth,
than Lucifer was in heauen? He
through pride fell from the higth
of his glorie, and wilt thou by preſumption
ſéeke ſuch aduancement,
as to exalt thy ſelfe on high out of
the doonghill?
                     Conſider thine owne eſtate and
condition, for the terme of thy life

in this world; examine what thou
art by the words of the wiſe man,
ſaieng: A corruptible bodie is heauie
vnto the ſoule, and the earthlie
manſion kéepeth downe that vnderſtanding,
which muſeth vpon
manie things.
                     With what thicke and palpable
darknes then, thinke we, is the dirt
of pride obſcured and defaced héere
on earth: when a ſtarre, which riſing
in the morning, and beautifieng
the heauen with his brightnes,
loſt the beames of his light?
                     Heare therefore, O man, and liſten
for thy learning to the voice of
truth it ſelfe ſpeaking vnto thée,
and ſaieng: He that followeth me,
walketh not in darknes, but ſhall
haue the light of life. The ſame
truth teacheth elſewhere, in what
points we ſhould followe him, ſaieng:
Learne of me, for I am méeke
and humble in hart, and you ſhall
find reſt for your ſoules.
                     Harken, O ſwelling pride, harken,
I ſaie, to the maiſter of humilitie

and méeknes: Euerie one that
exalteth himſelfe, ſhall be brought
lowe: and he that humbleth himſelfe,
ſhall be exalted.
                     Againe, Vpon whom doth my
ſpirit reſt, but vpon the humble and
quiet man, and him that trembleth
at my words and ſaiengs? Liſten
alſo, O ſwelling pride, what the
Apoſtle reporteth of this maiſter of
humilitie, exhorting men therevnto.
For he ſaith expreſſelie thus:
Let the ſame mind be in you which
was in Chriſt Ieſus, who being
in the forme of God, thought it no
robberie to be equall with God:
but made himſelfe of no reputation,
taking on him the forme of a
ſeruant, and made in the likenes of
men, and found in figure &amp; ſhape as
a man; he humbled himſelfe, made
obedient vnto death, euen the death
of the croſſe.
                     If therefore the diuine Maieſtie
abaſed himſelfe with ſo great humilitie;
the infirmitie, weakenes,
and vilenes of man ought not to

be inſolent, proud, arrogant, or preſumptuous.
                  
                  
                     3 A Praier for the former
vertue.
                     O Almightie, and euerliuing
God, which knoweſt better
than we our ſelues, what is moſt
conuenient for our condition and
eſtate; we beſeech thee to powre into
the veſſell of our harts the pleaſant
and acceptable liquor of humilitie,
which is a vertue wherewith
thou art ſo well pleaſed, as
with nothing more: promiſing to
ſuch as humble and ſubmit themſelues,
the poſſeſſion of eternall
life, according to the teſtimonie of
thy ſonne Chriſt, ſaieng, that Who
ſoeuer abaſeth himſelfe like a little
child, he ſhall be called great in the
kingdome of heauen.
                     O grant vnto vs, we beſeech thee,
of thine vnſpeakable goodnes, that
we may be inriched with this moſt
heauenlie vertue, knowing that the

ſame maketh vs like vnto Chriſt Ieſu,
who came into the world, as he
ſaith of himſelfe, to ſerue, and not to
be ſerued, as appeareth by the waſhing
of his Apoſtles feete, and by
taking vpon him the ſhape of a ſeruant,
whereby he made himſelfe of
no reputation, but was found and eſteemed
as a common and ordinarie
man, humbling himſelfe, and
being obedient to the death, euen
to the death of the croſſe; for the
which God his father exalted him,
and gaue him a name aboue all
names, that to the Name of IESVS,
euerie knee ſhould bow, both of
things in heauen, and things in
earth, and things vnder the earth.
                     O teach vs trulie to humble our
ſelues before thee, according to the
example, which Chriſt ſhewed to
his diſciples, that our praiers being
made in humilitie and lowlineſſe,
may pleaſe thy diuine Maieſtie, and
that pearcing through the clouds,
they may not reſt, till they come
neere; nor depart, till thou, ô moſt

high, haſt had reſpect therevnto.
Grant this for thine honour and
truths ſake, ô omnipotent God, and
mercifull Father, Amen.

                        VAINE-GLORIE flieth awaie
ſwiftlie, pearceth lightlie, ſmiteth
ſmoothlie, but woundeth ſhrewdlie, and
killeth quicklie. Vaine-glorie confoundeth

and laie open themſelues vnto it,
ſuch as run vpon it, as vpon a rocke, not
viewing the miſchiefe thereof, not marking
or conſidering it, not auoiding and
forſaking it; and not weieng with aduiſement,
how vaine, tranſitorie, fraile, and periſhable
it is.
                     For, ô man, if thou wouldest looke circumſpectlie
into vaine-glorie, and eſteeme
of it accordinglie, it ſhould be ſo
far from killing thee, that thou wouldest

rather kill, vtterlie destroie, and bring it

all other in euerie
reſpect. If thou
doo good, doo it to thy
commendation: beſtowe thy benefits
where thou maieſt be praiſed.
If thou be diſpoſed to doo anie man

place, and at ſuch a ſeaſonable
time, as there may be ſtanders by, &amp;
lookers on to beare witneſſe thereof,
and to call thée by the name of a
good &amp; pitifull man. It is loſt that
is done priuilie in corners, where
none beholding or ſéeing, can report
of thée according to thy deſart.
                     Doo therefore thy good déeds in
open ſight, before the eies of men,
that they may commend thée for
thy deuotion and holineſſe, praiſe
thée for thy mercifulnes, and reuerence

thee for thy goodneſſe: that
thou maiſt be counted one of Gods
elect, that none may contemne thée,
none deſpiſe thée, none ſpeake ill of
thée: but that all may exhibite and
doo thée ſuch honour &amp; reuerence,
as to thée by deſart is due and apperteining.

former vice.
                     O Eternall God, vnto whome all
glorie be longeth, and nothing
but ſhame and confuſion vnto vs bicauſe

of thine infinite goodnes and clemencie,
to kindle in vs a deteſtation
and mortall hatred againſt all inward
motions, rebelling and making
war with the ſpirit. And ſpeciallie,
ô mercifull Father, ſet vs at
defiance with all ſelfe-liking of our
ſelues, all ſelfe-loue, and ſelfe-truſt,
but ſpecialie with vain-glorie, which
maketh vs negligent and careleſſe
in giuing thee the honour due vnto
thine holie name.
                     
                        
We knowe, and thou ſeeſt it in vs,
that euen the meaneſt and baſeſt
perſon hath ſome infection, little or
much, of this poiſonous humor of
vaine-glorie, according to this ſaieng
of the Sonne of Sirach: The
poore man glorieth in his knoweledge,
and the rich bicauſe of his
goods and ſubſtance: but let him
that glorieth in his wealth, feare
leaſt he fall into want. O good Lord
open our eies, that we may not onelie
ſee, but alſo forſake this vanitie,
knowing that ſo long as we ſauour
thereof, we can not ſmell ſweete in
thy preſence.
                     Let not anie pompe or pride of
apparell carie vs awaie, ô let vs not
fixe our delight in ſuch ſhadowes,
knowing that thou diſaloweſt it, &amp;
by thy ſeruants counſelleſt vs to renounce
the ſame, ſaieng in expreſſe
words: Bee not proud of clothing
and raiment, and exalt not thy ſelfe
in the daie of honour. We knowe
&amp; confeſſe it, that againſt the proud
vaine-glorious Phariſies, louing &amp;

challenging the higheſt and chiefeſt
ſeates in ſynagogues, and delighting
to bee reuerenced in frequented
places, a bitter wo was denounced
by thy ſonne. Whereby we
are taught, in what contempt thou
haſt this vile vice of vaine-glorie.
                     O giue vs grace therfore, we hartilie
beſeech thee, not only to learne,
but alſo to folowe the good &amp; wholſome
counſell of thine Apoſtle S.
Paule, exhorting vs not to be deſirous
of vain-glorie, prouoking one
another, and enuieng another. For
if anie man ſeeme to himſelfe that
he is ſomwhat, when he is nothing,
he deceiueth himſelfe in his imagination.
Grant this, we humblie beſeech

                         Man, if thou dooſt anie
good, doo it in hope
of euerlaſting honor,
not of tranſitorie eſtimation;
of an heauenlie
reward, not of an earthlie
recompenſe. Hide and kéepe cloſe
that which thou dooſt, as much as

thou maiſt. And it thou be not altogither
able ſo to doo, yet let thy will
and mind be to haue it vnknowne,
ſo ſhall there be no raſhnes in thée
of anie vaunting what good déeds
thou haſt done: neither ſhall it bée
imputed vnto thée for a fault, as
time ſerueth to declare that, which
thou waſt willing ſhould bée alwaies
kept ſecret.
                     Thus dooing, thou ſhalt fulfill
the twoo ſaiengs of our Sauiour
Chriſt, ſéeming contrarie to themſelues:
In giuing almes, let not
thy left hand knowe what thy
right hand dooth; but let thine
almes be in ſecret, and thy Father,
which ſéeth in ſecret ſhall reward
thée openlie. Againe, Let men ſée
your good works, that they may
glorifie your Father, which is in
heauen.
                     Take héed at anie hand, that the
ſaieng of our Sauiour to hypocrites
agrée not with thée: They
doo all their works, that they may
be ſéene and praiſed of men. Verely

the cauſe that manie miſdeedes,
which otherwiſe might be withſtood
are committed.
                     O Lord, arme vs, we humblie beſeech
thee, that the whole courſe of
our life directed thereby, we may
not miſcarrie: being aſſured, that it
is a welſpring of life, againſt the
ſnares of death: that who ſo is filled
therwith, ſhall continue ſufficientlie
fortified in the euill day: that
it is riches, glorie, &amp; life: gladnes,
mirth, and a crowne of ioie vnto
them: and that ſuch as are guided
thereby, ſhall find fauour in the day
of death, perfect peace, and euerlaſting
life: which we beſeech thee
grant, ô Father, for thy ſonnes ſake,
Amen.

od, ſingular, and vnuſed, to

from Christ, &amp; delighted with vaine
commendations and praiſes.

but in face: hypocriſie is a ſheepe in
skin, a fox in ſubtiltie, and a wolfe in crueltie.
It would ſeeme good in ſhew, and is
nothing leſſe in deed; it would not bee
thought euill, and yet is ſtarke naught in
all points. It is diſguiſed with a pretended
vizard of holines and innocencie, that it
might the more cunninglie deceiue the
ſimple, and drawe weaklings to commit
ſinne and wickednes.

Chriſt, whoſe will and pleaſure it is
to be worſhipped in ſpirit &amp; truth:
we beſeech thee to roote out of our
harts all hypocriſie and diſſembled
adoration of thy diuine Maieſtie,
all counterfet ſeruice, and phariſaicall
deuotion, which are vtter enimies
to true Chriſtianitie: leaſt
preſuming to offer ſuch an vnclene
and defiled ſacrifice in thine holie
temple, we be adiudged with hypocrites
to feele the endles torments
of fire &amp; brimſtone in the nethermoſt
hell.
                     We knowe that it is not for vs to
dallie with thee, who knoweſt our
inward thoughts: to halt before
thee, who perceiueſt our deuiſes: to
diſſemble with thee, who ſeeſt out

ſecret imaginations: knowing that
the ſubtileſt ſhift which we can vſe,
and the cloſeſt conueiance that we
can inuent, lieth open before thee
bare, naked, and vncouered. For
thou canſt turne vs out of our cloke
of hypocriſie, and make vs appeare
as we are, euen to our owne rebuke
and ſhame.
                     It is an expreſſe commandement
ſet downe in thine holie word, ô
moſt mercifull Father, that whatſoeuer
we thinke, ſaie, or doo, ſhould
ſauour of ſingleneſſe and vprightnes.
And therefore in giuing our
almes, thou teacheſt vs what rule
we ſhould obſerue; namelie, that we
ſhould not doo as hypocrites doo,
who cauſe a trumpet to ſound out
their almes-deedes, in the ſynagogues,
villages, and frequented
places, where they beſtowe their
dole: to the end that they might be
honored of men.
                     In praieng alſo and in faſting, it
is thy will and pleaſure, that wee
ſhould ſhew a ſimplicitie &amp; plaine

dealing, all diſſembling with thee,
ô God, and the world ſet apart.
For though we may delude men, by
an extrinſecall kind of religiouſnes
and preciſenes of life: yet can wee
not outreach the vniuerſall wiſedome
of thee, ô Lord, who canſt and
wilt pull awaie the fig-leaues from
our filthines, and diſcouer our ſecret
ſhame. O good God, we humblie
beſeech thee therfore to keepe
and defend vs from this deteſtable
ſinne, whervpon dependeth a moſt
heauie iudgement, propheſied by
the mouth of thy ſeruant Iob, to
light vpon all hypocrites and diſſemblers:
namelie, that Their hope
ſhall periſh, their confidence be cut
off, and their truſt decaie like a ſpiders
web: that they ſhall not once
appeare in thy preſence, they ſhall
be deſolate, and fire ſhall conſume
their dwellings: their ioie ſhall laſt
but a moment, their excellencie
become as vile as doong, they ſhall
vaniſh like a dreame or viſion in
the night: and their finall reward

ſhall bee euerlaſting torments in
hell fire, where ſhall be weeping,
wailing, &amp; gnaſhing of teeth. From
this ſinne, ô Lord, and the plagues
due therevnto, deliuer vs for thy
mercie ſake, Amen.

following.
                     
                        MEate ſauoureth in the mouth, and
the praiſe of God in the hart. It is
to ſmall purpoſe to magnifie the Lords
name with the voice onelie, without anie
meaning or intent of the mind. For God,
from whom nothing is hid, that is vnlawfullie
done, requireth not the ſhrilnes and
cleerenes of the voice, but the cleannes
and purenes of the hart.
                     Wilt thou therefore worſhip God aright,
doo him true and alowable ſeruice,
and ſhew thy ſelfe an imbracer of pure
religion? Then worſhip him in ſpirit and
truth, with ſinglenes of hart, with a ſincere
and vpright mind; viſit the fatherles,
maintaine the widowes right, followe

the example of Christ, and keepe thy ſelfe
vnſpotted of the world. This is true worſhip,
this is pure religion.
                  
                  
                     2 The REPVLSE giuen by true
WORSHIP, and pure
RELIGION.
                     
                        
                           O
                         Man, take héede in
anie caſe of counterfeting
&amp; forging thy
ſelfe to be that thou
art not. For to ſéeme
before men otherwiſe than thou
art, what elſe is it but meere damnation?
Remember therefore the
words of our Sauior Chriſt, ſpoken
to this effect: Wo be vnto you
Scribes &amp; Phariſies hypocrites,
for ye make cleane the out-ſide of
the cup or platter, but within you
are ful of robberie and vncleannes.
                     O thou blind Phariſie, firſt
make cleane the in-ſide of the cup
or platter, that the out-ſide of them
may be cleane alſo. And the words
of our Sauior vttered in the verie
ſame ſenſe, with an often repetition

or reherſall: Wo vnto you Scribes
and Phariſies, bicauſe you are like
vnto painted ſepulchres, which
appeare outwardlie to the eies of
men gaie and beautifull, but are
full within of dead mens bones,
and all filthines.
                     Euen ſo you likewiſe ſéeme before
men iuſt and righteous, but
within you are full of hypocriſie
and wickednes. Vpon whom this
ſentence of our Sauiour is verified:
They come vnto you in ſhéeps
clothing, but inwardlie they are
rauening woolues.
                  
                  
                     3 A praier for the former
vertue.
                     O Eternall God, without whoſe
aid and aſſiſtance, all our actions
are turned into ſinne, bicauſe
they are not ſeaſoned with the ſalt
of thy ſpirit, but leauened rather
with the dowe of the fleſh: we beſeech
thee of thine entire goodnes,
to teach vs the true worſhip of thee,

and the ſincere ſeruice due vnto thy
diuinitie. O ſuffer vs not to be miſled
by the imaginations and traditions
of men, which highlie offend
thy Maieſtie; but vouchſafing to open
the eies of our vnderſtanding
with the keie of thine heauenlie
knowledge, direct vs how and in
what ſort we may walke religiouſlie
before thee.
                     Roote out of our harts, good God,
all ſiniſter ſeruice, and diſſembled
adoration: lead vs by the hand into
thine holie temple, and make a paſſage
for thy ſpirit of ſanctification
into our dull and darke capacities:
that being reformed therby, we may
worſhip thee in ſpirit and truth:
knowing that thou art a ſpirit, and
therefore wilt admit none other
worſhip to be done vnto thee, but
that which is true, vnfeigned, ſincere,
and ſpirituall.
                     We knowe how thou haſt abhorred
the hypocriticall holines of the
Gentiles, of whom thou complaineſt
by thy Prophet Eſaie, that they

DISOBEDIENCE.
                     
                        
                           O
                         Man, conſider thine
owne dignitie &amp; worthines.
Thine eſtate
is honourable, and
thou art better than
the beſt. To ſerue and obeie is an
abaſing of thy vocation, it is a
ſigne of inferioritie and ſubiection.
To be a maiſter carrieth ſome title
of authoritie: but to be an vnderling
or ſeruant, is an argument
and token of an homelie and courſe
calling. Account of thy ſelfe therefore,
and of thy reputation. What
art thou, that thou ſhouldeſt do homage
to ſuch as are woorſe than
thy ſelfe?
                     It were more méete for thée to
command and gouerne, and they to
obey and be ruled; conſidering thou
art ſo excellent in all reſpects, that
there is not one to be found comparable
vnto thée, either in wit, policie,
diligence, or anie other good

qualitie. Caſt off the yoke therefore
of ſubiection, for to obeie is ſeruitude
and bondage, ſlauerie &amp; thraldome:
yea, to be inferiour to ſuch
as are not thy betters, is a token
of a baſe mind, and a cowards hart.
                     Therefore eſtéeme of thy ſelfe
Lord-like, and not ſeruant-like:
ſtoope not vnto anie, cap not,
crouch not: for a man is but a
man: and thou being a rare man
and matchleſſe, néedeſt not paſſe a
point for the proudeſt pecocke, for
all his fine feathers, and trim taile.
And rather than thou ſhouldeſt be
at commandement like a ſeruant,
trie maiſteries for ſuperioritie, and
get it by vſurpation. For a loftie
looke, and an hautie hart doo beſt
béecome a man.
                  
                  
                     3 A praier againſt the
former vice.
                     O Moſt louing Father, who hateſt
all kind of diſobedience,
frowardnes, ſtubbornes, rebellion,

contumacie, obſtinacie, and contempt:
which are the fruits of the
corrupt fleſh; and haſt declared alſo
thy hatred by denouncing moſt terrible
plagues againſt ſo deteſtable
ſinne: we beſeech thee to plow vp
the ſandie ſoile of our harts with
the cultre of thy ſanctifieng ſpirit,
that wee may beecome tractable,
mild, gentle, lowlie, and obedient,
as it becommeth vs.
                     We knowe, by the information of
thy holie word, that who ſo diſobeieth
thee, is ſubiect to manie curſes:
and who ſo reſiſteth a iudiciall magiſtrate,
is puniſhable with death,
euen by thine owne ordinance and
lawe. We know that thou deteſteſt
nothing more than the ſinne of diſobedience,
and tranſgreſſion of thy
commandements; though the intent
ſeeme neuer ſo good, honeſt,
and tollerable to mans iudgement
and reaſon.
                     This is prooued, ô eternall God,
in Saule, whom thou by the mouth
of Samuel didſt charge with a preciſe

commandement, that he ſhould
kill Amalek, and make a common
ſpoile and hauocke of all that came
to his hands: who being incenſed
with couetouſnes, ſpared the verie
beſt things, and conuerted them to
his owne vſe and poſſeſſion, contrarie
to thy will. But thou in thy iuſtice
didſt ſhew thy vengeance vpon
him, in not onelie reiecting and
caſting him out of thy fauour, but
alſo in diſgrading him of his dignitie,
and taking from him his kingdome.
                     We beſeech thee therfore, ô King
of glorie, to roote out of our harts
this ranke weede of diſobedience,
which in holie Scripture is reported
to be as the ſin of witchcraft. O
good Lord, dig it vp quite, we praie
thee, out of the depth of out harts,
that there may no relike thereof
remaine, but that euerie fiber and
thred growing about it, may bee
plucked out and remooued. For if it
be not vtterlie ſupplanted, we muſt
needs looke and make full account

to receiue a iuſt recompenſe and reward,
according to the determinate
ſentence of thy holie word. Deliuer
vs, ô Lord, from this heinous ſinne,
and the deſart due to the ſame, for
thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſts ſake, Amen.

                        THE vertue of obedience, ô man, doth
alwaies march vnder the banner of
truth. Obedience directeth our footsteps,
ordereth our goings, and deſerueth the
grace or reward of holie conuerſation. For
if a contrarie lawe be in our members by
diſobedience, who knoweth not that continencie
or ſtaiednes is giuen by obedience?
                     This is the vertue that can tell what
belongeth to mercie, this teacheth thee
patience, this bringeth thee to the full and
complete knowledge of thine owne condition.
Learne of Chriſt, who ſubmitted himſelfe
to his Diſciples, the Maister to his
ſeruants, the Sauior of the world, and verie
God, to miſerable men; the word and

wiſedome of the father, to mortall creatures.
Bluſh ô earth and aſhes, bluſh and

                         Man, remember that
if thou owe anie dutie
to God, there is
alſo a dutie required
of thée to diſcharge

you, heareth me: and he that deſpiſeth

                     It is conuenient (thou wilt ſaie
O man) ſo to doo, prouided that hée

O good Lord, be ſo fauourable
vnto vs, as to bring vnder &amp; ſubdue
the vnrulie and rebellious motions
of our mind, which oftentimes
driue vs to the committing of manie
a wicked offence, not onelie in
talke and communication, but alſo
in deed, life, and conuerſation: leaſt
ſhaking from our necks the yoke of
obedience &amp; ſubmiſſion, and neglecting
the true obſeruation and
fulfilling of thy lawe; we fall into
flat rebellion againſt thee, and ſo
prouoking thee to anger, feele the

ſtriking vs in thy furie with the
ſword of vengeance.
                     Direct vs, good Lord, by thy ſpirit,
that we may ſubmit our ſelues
to all our gouernours and magiſtrates,
without murmuring, grudging,
or repining: knowing that all
authoritie, regiment, ſuperioritie,
and countenance proceedeth from
thee, who beſtoweſt thy gifts according
to thine owne counſell, not
looking vpon the perſon of the receiuer,

leaſt thou mighteſt ſeeme
parciall in the diſtribution of thy
gifts.
                     Thou haſt ſaid, and expreſſelie
charged, that we ſhould be ſubiect
to the higher powers, yea, euen to
the Scribes and Phariſies ſitting in
Moſes chaire, whom thou cōmandeſt
vs to heare, and to doo according
to their perſuaſion and counſell:
but not to make their courſe
of life and trade of dealing, a patterne
for vs to followe and imitate.
Arme vs therefore with true knowledge,
that may lead vs to perfect
and acceptable obedience, which
thou eſteemeſt more than the fat of
rams, or the ſmoke of incenſe. O
ſuffer not anie ſuggeſtion of Satan,
to withdrawe vs from dooing our
dutie in this caſe, leaſt by diſobeiing,
we purchaſe to ourſelues

                        DEſireſt thou, ô man, to knowe a venemous
eie, a wicked eie, a bewitching
eie? Conſider enuie. For what is enuie,
but a make-bate? What is ſpitefulnes,
but a moouer of miſchiefe? If the ſerpent
had not beene enuious and ſpitefull, death
had neuer entred into the world by that
vile vice.
                     Wo to thee, ô wretched man, bicauſe
thou didst not fore-ſpie the enuious ſerpent.
Let vs doo our verie best to preſſe
downe, and ouerſwaie this ſinne, whiles we
liue, if after death we would be loth to
ſtand in feare of the worker of ſo great
wickednes.
                     And, ô man, whoſoeuer thou art, ſpite
not at thy brothers proſperitie, if thou

there is death alſo; then doubtleſſe thou

therefore take heed of au enuious eie.

thou not equall with them, or rather

                     Thou art able to bring manie
things to paſſe, whereto they can
not laie their hands. And they are
able to doo nothing, but it is in thée

vice.
                     O Eternall truth, thou ſonne of
the liuing God, and wiſedome

of the Father, which by thine Apoſtle
Paule, that excellent preacher
of thy Goſpell to the Gentiles, diddeſt
teach the Romans, and in them
all Chriſtian people, to caſt awaie
the works of darknes, to put on the
armour of light, and to walke honeſtlie
as in the daie, not in drunkennes
and gluttonie, chambering
and wantonnes, ſtrife and enuieng:
roote out of our harts, we beſeech
thee, all corrupt affections, and ſpeciallie
wicked emulation and enuie,
the nurſe of all contention.
                     We knowe and confeſſe; that ſo
long as emulation, ſtrife, debate,
enuie, and grudging reigne among
vs, we are carnall, &amp; walke as men,
in the corruption of our owne nature.
And there is nothing truer,
than that ſentence of thine Apoſtle
S. Iames, that where enuieng and
ſtrife is, there is ſedition, and all
maner of euill works. Wherefore, ô
thou comfortable Phyſician of ſick
ſoules, deliuer vs from ſo foule and
deteſtable a ſinne, leaſt all our enterpriſes

and endeuours diſpleaſe
thy ſacred diuinitie, and heape vpon
our owne heads the hot burning
coales of vengeance and condemnation.
                     Now then, ô thou paterne of
loue, thou treaſure of all vertue,
godlines, and integritie, put into
our minds Chriſtian cogitations &amp;
thoughts, guide our eies from the
view of vanities, hold backe our
hands from euerie iniurious deed,
and conſecrate all that is within vs
to thy ſelfe; that we may, as thou
haſt taught vs, doo good to our enimies,
loue them that hate vs, and
praie for ſuch as ſeeke our deſtruction
and vndooing, referring the
iudgement of our cauſe, and the reuengement
of the ſame vnto thee,
who in thy good time wilt redreſſe

redeemedſt all mankind,

in vnitie like brethren. Which ſo long as
we doo, no doubt we dwell in God, and God
dwelleth in vs.
                     For God is loue, and he that dwelleth
in loue, dwelleth in God. He loueth vs, bicauſe

haue made; giuing vs an example how
we should loue and tender one another,
with ſinglenes of hart; which who ſo doth
not, that man abideth in death.

                         Man, if thou excell
all other in vertues
of the mind, it will be
more ſafe, and leſſe
dangerous for thée, to
keepe thy ſelfe belowe, than to clime
aloft. For the higher roome that a
man coueteth, the ſorer is his fall.
Furthermore, if ſome be thy ſuperiours,
that is, aboue and better
than thou; or equall, that is, as
good as thou; what ſhould that
gréeue thée, what ſhould that hurt
thée, what ſhould that vexe and
trouble thée?
                     Take héed, leaſt whiles thou
art enuious at the high and honorable
place of thy brother, thou
ſhew thy ſelfe a ſcholler &amp; diſciple
of him, of whom theſe words are
written: Through enuie of the deuill,
death entred into the world, &amp;
they that folowe him take his part.

vertue.
                     O Almightie and moſt mercifull
Father, which by the mouth of
thy Prophet Dauid haſt highlie cō
                        mended
brotherlie concord and agreement,
comparing it to the pretious
ointment, which ran downe
vpon Aarons beard, euen to the
borders of his garments: and alſo
to the dew of Hermon, which dropped
and fell vpon the mountaines
of Sion: we beſeech thee of thy
goodnes, to plant among vs ſuch
and ſo acceptable agreement, that
bearing one anothers burthen, we
may liue like brothers begotten &amp;
borne of the ſame parents.
                     We knowe that thy ſonne our Sauiour
Ieſus Chriſt, as of all other
commendable vertues, ſo alſo of
brotherlie agreement, gaue vs a
ſpeciall and infallible example, in
that for our ſakes he betooke himſelfe
to the ſuffering of moſt exquiſite

torments, euen the torments of
death, that he might drawe vs his
adopted brethren to God his Father,
and might place vs in the land
of Canaan, as ioint-heires with
him of euerlaſting bleſſednes.
                     Now therefore, ô eternall God,
let vs not ſeeme lightlie to eſteme
and regard ſo ſingular an example;
but giue vs grace, we beſeech thee,
to conſider that notable ſpeech of
thy Prophet Malachie vttered for
our learning, that Seeing we haue
all one Father, one God, and one
Maker, it is not meete nor tollerable
that we ſhould deſpiſe one another:
but euerie one of vs bearing
one anothers burden, mutuallie to
conſent and agree in brotherlie amitie,
vniue, and concord.
                     Sowe in our harts therefore, ô
good Lord, the ſeed of loue &amp; charitie,
that thereby we may growe
togither like branches of one tree,
being all of one mind and hart, of
one opinion and iudgement, endeuouring
as much as in vs lieth, to

doo thy will, euen thy will, ô father,
which dwelleſt in heauen: which is,
to be knit one to another in brotherlie
agreement, &amp; to drawe all
vnder one yoke of obedience, which
is the foundation of all godlie loue
and mutuall conſent. Grant this for
thy ſonnes ſake Ieſus Chriſt our onlie
mediator and aduocate, Amen.

                        THere is a commendable hatred, and
there is an execrable or damnable
hatred; the one is allowed of God, but
not vſed of men; the other is common
among men, and offenſiue to God.
                     The firſt is an hatred of ſinne and iniquitie,
and of this hatred the feare of the
Lord is a fore-runner; and is conceiued
in the harts of the godlie, for Gods ſake,
bicauſe he himſelfe hateth ſinne, and detesteth
all wicked dooers.
                     
                        
The other hatred proceedeth from the
diuell the author of diſſention, kindeleth
in men a loue of ſinne and vngodlines, a
delight in all kind of miſchiefe, an vtter
miſliking of agreement, vnitie, and reconciliation;
wherewith whoſoeuer is poiſoned,
that man hateth his owne ſoule, and
is an enimie to his owne ſaluation.

                         Man, forſweare to
loue him, who is thy
enimie in all things.
Neuer, ſo long as thy
life laſteth, agrée with
him, who is contrarie and againſt
thée in euerie reſpect. Neuer ſhake
hands with him, which taketh
from thée anie iot of thy right. Neuer
giue him faire looke, neuer ſhew
him kind countenance, which doth
out-face thée, triumph ouer thée,
ſcorne and ſcoffe at thée, prouoke
thée to vnpatience by wrongs and
iniuries.
                     Neuer like of him ſo long as

thou liueſt, which is alwaies caſting
thy faults in thy téeth. Neuer
abide him, that doth what he
can to excell thée in words, déeds,
credit, and preferment. For, if he
did not enuie thée, is it like hée
would in this ſort ſéeke his owne
aduancement, aboue thée, which
art his better?

former vice.
                     O Eternall God, in whoſe hands
is life and death, ſicknes and
health, pouertie and abundance,
ſaluation and condemnation; direct
vs, we beſeech thee in thy faith,
feare, and loue, that we may feele
the operation and working of thy
holie ſpirit in our harts, leading vs
into all honeſtie, godlines, righteouſnes,
holines, and innocencie,
that thy name may be magnified in
our life, and we our ſelues glorified
after our death.
                     And bicauſe it is denied to vs all

of Adams linage, vnles we be circumciſed
in ſpirit, ſanctified, &amp; regenerate
by the influence of thy heauenlie
grace, to attaine to the ſight
of thee, which art the fulnes of all
felicitie, the ſouereigne bleſſednes,
which endureth for euer: grant vs
we beſeech thee the preſence of thy
knowledge, whereby we being conducted,
may learne to purge out of
our harts the old leuen of maliciouſnes,
hatred, enuie, and ſpitefulnes,
which hinder and ſtop vs from
hauing acceſſe to thy diuinitie.
                     We knowe, ô eternall God, that
hatred is ſo deteſtable a ſinne in
thy ſight, that thou vtterlie abhorreſt
vs for ſo heinous a ſinnes ſake,
denieng the participation of thy
ſpirit, which is the peace of conſcience,
and the aſſurance of euerlaſting
life, to as manie as are poſſeſſed
therewith. In conſideration
whereof, and bicauſe it is a naturall
inclination, bred and continued in
vs, euen from our cradles, to be at
ſtrife with them that ſpeake ill of

vs, &amp; to hate ſuch as bere vs no good
will: we beſeech thee to alter and
change that diueliſh diſpoſition, &amp;
to amend in vs whatſoeuer is amis.
                     We are taught, that there is a hatred,
which thou requireſt; namelie,
the hatred of our ſelues, and of all
things pretious and deere in our
owne eies: but that hatred is as
hard for vs to digeſt, as was the doctrine
of regeneration to Nichodemus.
O therefore thou comforter
of thy choſen, and lifter vp of thy
ſeruants heads in the time of heauines,
inſtruct vs in the waie of thy
truth, and reforme our harts; make
them new, ô Lord, that they may
harbour no worke of darknes, neither
hatred, nor anie other vice,
which may offend thee: thorough
Chriſt our Lord, Amen.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     1 S. BARNARDS golden
ſentence of the vertue
following.
                     
                        CHARITIE is a goodlie thing, yea
it is a thing that will not ſhrinke in

anie tribulation, in anie greefe, iniurie,
wrong, or abuſe. In few words, what thinke
we comparable therevnto, ſeeing it is preferred
before martyrdome, and counted
better than a faith that mooueth mountaines?
                     By charitie man dwelleth in God, and
God in man. Charitie bringeth libertie,
driueth awaie feare, feeleth no toile, looketh
on no deſart, requireth no reward.
                     Charitie is the mother of men and of
Angels, pacifieng and making attonement
betweene things in heauen, and things in
earth. This is the vertue which reconciled
God to man, and brought man into
the fauour of God.
                  
                  
                     2 The REPVLSE giuen by true
LOVE and CHARITIE.
                     
                        
                           O
                         Man, doth it neceſſarilie
followe, that
bicauſe manie vices
in thée deſerue well
and woorthilie to bée
hated, that therefore the image of
God in thée ought not to be loued?
As Ieſus Chriſt nailed vpon the

croſſe, and there hanging, loued his
enimies, and before his death and
paſſion admoniſhed his diſciples in
this maner, ſaieng: Loue your enimies,
doo good vnto them that hate
you: and praie for them which perſecute
you, ſlander, backbite, and
vpbraid you, that you may be the
children of your Father which is
in heauen.
                     So likewiſe, by the mouth of
Salomon and Paule, theſe words
are ſpoken: If thine enimie hunger,
giue him meate: if he thirſt,
giue him drinke. For in ſo dooing,
thou ſhalt heape coles of fire vpon
his head. Vnto which ſentence the
Apoſtle addeth ſomewhat of his
owne, ſaieng: Be not ouercome of
euill, but ouercome euill with good.
                     It is contrariwiſe thus written
by S. Iohn, againſt ſuch as
hate their brethren: He that hateth
his brother, is a man-ſlear,
and ye knowe that no man-ſlear
hath euerlaſting life remaining in
him. Againe, He that hateth his

brother, walketh in darknes, and
is yet in darknes, not knowing
whither he goeth, bicauſe darknes
hath blinded his eies.
                     But thou ſaieſt, O man, It is
enough that I loue ſuch as loue
me. For why ſhould I beare good
will, or be beneficiall vnto them,
that haue deſerued no ſuch thing
at my hand? Heare, O man, the
Lord ſpeaking vnto thée in another
tune: for, If you loue them
that loue you, what reward ſhall
you haue? Doo not the Publicans
the ſame?
                     What art thou able, O man, to
obiect againſt this? Doubtles, He
that hateth his brother abideth in
death. And he that loueth his brother,
abideth in God, and God in
him. Spue vp therefore all the bitter
gall of hatred, &amp; doo what thou
canſt to ſwallowe downe the ſwéet
honie of loue. For nothing is more
pleaſant, nothing more happie and
bleſſed.
                     Saint Iohn ſaith, God is charitie.

And S. Paule that excellent
preacher of the Gentils affirmeth,
that The loue of GOD is ſhed
abroad in our harts, by the holie
Ghoſt, which is giuen vnto vs.
Whervpon it is concluded, and not
without iuſt cauſe, that loue or
charitie is ſaid to couer the multitude
of our brethrens offences, as
it is written: Charitie couereth
the multitude of ſinnes.
                  
                  
                     3 A praier for the former
vertue.
                     O Eternall GOD, which by the
mouth of thine Apoſtle Paule
haſt ſaid, that Although we ſpeake
with the tongues of men and Angels,
and yet are void of loue, we
are like to ſounding braſſe, or as a
tinkling cymbal: yea, albeit we had
the gift of propheſie, and knew all
ſecrets: yea, if we had all faith, ſo
that we could remooue mountains,
and yet wanted loue, we were nothing:
heare vs, we beſeech thee,

and by the heate of thy loue, ſet on
fire and kindle our cold and froſen
loue.
                     We confeſſe, that the cauſe why
iniquitie and ſinne aboundeth, is
the lacke of loue, which in holie
Scripture is called the bond of
peace. We acknowledge alſo that to
loue our neighbour as our ſelfe, is
a ſacrifice much more acceptable,
than burnt oblations &amp; incenſe. We
can not denie, but that the Apoſtle
ſpeaketh truth, ſaieng: that, Who ſo
dwelleth in loue &amp; charitie, dwelleth
in thee, ô GOD, and thou in
him.
                     But bicauſe it is not in vs to liue
in loue and charitie, knowing that
they are the works of light, vnleſſe
thou aſſiſt vs by thy grace; ſanctifie
vs, and cleanſe vs from all intrinſecall
and hidden corruption: wee
therefore bend the knees of our
harts before thee, humblie beſeeching
thy diuine Maieſtie, that as
thou art the fulnes and perfection
of loue, yea loue &amp; charitie it ſelfe,

ſo it would pleaſe thee to conforme
and make vs like vnto thee, which
delighteſt in nothing that is euill.
                     And bicauſe charitie couereth the
multitude of ſinnes, fulfilleth the
lawe, is the end of the commandement,
and commended vnto vs as a
moſt neceſſarie adiument &amp; helpe
to obteine and laie hold vpon euerlaſting
life: vouchſafe we beſeech
thee, to plow vp our ſtonie harts,
and to ſoften them with the ſhowers
of thy grace, that being mollified
and ſoupled, they may be able to
receiue the ſeed of loue and charitie,
and thereby fructifie in all good
works, through Ieſus Chriſt our
Lord, Amen.

                     AS the confeſſion of ſinne hath the
promiſe of remiſſion, ſo the excuſing

and cloking of ſinne is threatened with
puniſhment. Againe, it is no diſſembling
with God, who abhorreth all ſinne, and
much worſe the excuſe of ſinne, which is
more heinous than the ſinne it ſelfe.
                     As for ſlander, and flatterie, I wiſh
wiſe men to beware of both. Moreouer,
whether to ſlander, or to giue eare to a
ſlanderer, be more damnable, I can not
eaſilie tell. This is certaine; that death entreth
in at our windowes, ſo often as we
with our itching eares and tongues, contend
and ſtriue to drinke one to another
out of the full poiſoned and deadlie cup
of ſlander. The Lord ſaue my ſoule, that it
fall not into the hands of ſlanderers.

                           O
                         Man, perſuade thy
ſelfe that thou art
not the moſt heinous
offender aliue. Thou
haſt not béene as other
men be, an extortioner, a vſurer,
a turne-cote, a mercileſſe murtherer,

or ſuch like.
                     There be ſinners that haue
committed all theſe tranſgreſſions
with gréedineſ. Who can laie to
ones charge, or kéepe cloſe the abhominable
déeds that ſuch a lewd
fellowe, and ſuch a wicked perſon
hath done, but he that hath béene
acceſſarie, and giuen his conſent
therevnto?
                     To iuſtifie thy ſelfe, O man, the
next way is to backbite &amp; ſpeake ill
of others, that none may ſéeme ſo
good as thy ſelfe. Thou muſt ſaie,
that ſuch a one is a common drunkard,
a craftie knaue, a kéeper of
another mans wife, a haunter of
harlots: and if thou perceiue it will
be for thy profit, ſpare not thine
owne ſiſter or brother, to call them
by the names of naughtipackes,
that by reporting of them thus abroad,
they may growe in contempt,
and thou increaſe in credit.
                     Sticke not to backbite thy déereſt
friend, if it may be for thine aduantage.
For, to ſaie the woorſt

ſometime bringeth no ſmall commoditie,
and manie haue come to
ſhame and reproch by ſtanding to
the truth.

gouernor of heauen and earth,
which haſt puniſhed, euen from the
beginning, all ſuch as hauing tranſgreſſed
againſt thee, ſought notwithſtanding
to iuſtifie themſelues:
by caſting a cloud of excuſe ouer
their offences committed: as namelie,
our great grandfather Adam,
who when he had done amis, complained
that the woman deceiued
him; and ſhe coueting to be blameleſſe,
turned the falt to the ſerpents
ſubtiltie: grant we beſeech thee, vnto
vs an humble hart, trulie to confeſſe
our ſelues before thee, fowle
offenders, and vile abuſers of thy
goodnes.
                     Thy word moſt manifeſtlie declareth,
how horriblie thou dooeſt

hate this offence, which by how
much it is couered with an excuſe:
by ſo much it deſerueth the ſorer
puniſhment: taking Saule for an example,
who moſt impudentlie defending
his fault of diſobedience,
ſuffered a double puniſhment, euen
depriuation of his roialtie, and an
ignominious or ſhamefull end. And
therefore, ô Father of mercie, take
not from vs thy grace and holie ſpirit,
leaſt we likewiſe offending, be
ſemblablie plagued.
                     Furthermore, ô eternall God,
bicauſe it is expreſſelie told vs by
thine Apoſtle Paule, that neither
whiſperers, backbiters, ſlanderers,
nor conſequentlie anie ſinner ſhall
poſſeſſe the kingdome of heauen;
but ſhall haue their portion with
Satan, that old diuell, in the lake
that burneth with fire &amp; brimſtone;
and bicauſe alſo thine Apoſtle
Iames likewiſe teacheth vs, that he
that ſlandereth &amp; condemneth his
brother, ſlandereth and condemneth
the lawe: roote out therefore,

we beſeech thee, ô Lord, from our
harts that abhominable ſin of ſlander,
againſt which thy ſeruants
make ſuch vehement outcries.
                     And open our eares, wee praie
thee, ô Father, to heare; and our
harts alſo to vnderſtand and comprehend
that good and wholeſome
counſell of S. Peter, willing vs to

                        THere is a rebuking, which is neceſſarie;
and a rebuking, which is vaine

if the rebuker be not culpable of
the ſame offence, whereof he reprooueth
another: the other breedeth obstinacie
and contempt, when the reprehender controlleth
his brother for ſome fault, whereof
he himſelfe is guiltie. The firſt iſſueth

rather phrenſie,
                     As for backbiting, whoſoeuer vſeth it,
he is a man-queller: and the tongue of a
backbiter is a venemous viper, ſtinging
three at once to death, with one deadlie
blast. It is a ſharpe, yea a verie ſharpe
ſpeare, which goreth three at once with

rather a three edged ſword, hewing and
hacking three at once with one blowe;

ſlander, and holdeth his peace.

ought not to bée

mooued, and out of patience, prooue
neuer the better by that kind of
correction; but be ſo farre from
amending, that hée take greater
cauſe of offending: heare the holie
Scripture, thus determining the
matter: Open rebuke is better
than ſecret loue.
                     Againe, if thou ſhalt neglect this
Chriſtian dutie, and wilt rather
chooſe to ſlander and miſſe-report
thy brothers fault, aggrauating
and making it woorſe, though he be
an offender, and woorthie of correction:
than otherwiſe to reprooue
him to his face, that he may be aſhamed
of his ſinne, and endeuour
to amend; hearken to the voice of
the Prophet ſpeaking vnto thée,

and ſaieng: Thou ſateſt, and ſpakeſt
againſt thy brother; yea, and
haſt ſlandered thine owne mothers
ſonne: and this is a ſore offence.
For a man taketh more gréefe and
hart-burning by knowing him, of
whom he is ſlandered; than by ſéeing
and hearing him, of whom he is
reprooued.
                     And bicauſe the miſdéeds of offenders
are for a time to be diſſembled
and kept in ſecret, that in due
ſeaſon they may be reprehended for
their faults; therefore theſe words
following are ſet downe: Theſe
things haſt thou done, and I held
my tongue.
                     Furthermore, leaſt backbiters
and ſlanderers ſhould growe into
an excéeding loue &amp; liking of themſelues,
by reaſon of this diſcréete
ſilence, who couet alwaies rather
priuilie and in corners to nick
a mans good name and fame, than
to come foorth in open place, and
there to charge him with his offence,
it followeth in theſe words:

Thou thoughteſt wickedlie, that
I am euen ſuch a one as thy ſelfe.
                     As if he had ſaid, It is a wicked
thing to thinke, that I am a ſlanderer,
and a backbiter, bicauſe I
hold my tongue for a time, &amp; kéepe
ſilence, vntill I ſpie due ſeaſon, and
fit choiſe of place to ſpeake my
mind by waie of reprehenſion.
                     Herevpon it followeth by and by,
I will reprooue thée, and ſet before
thée the things that thou haſt doon.
As if he had ſaid, Not ſecretlie, after
thy vſe and cuſtome: but openlie,
according to mine owne maner
and faſhion; I will tarrie a conuenient
time, when I may throughlie
rebuke an offender, and charge
him with his miſdéeds to his face.
                     But thou wilt ſaie, O man, I
doo not hate, but loue him, whom I
thus reprooue priuilie in corners.
And I ſaie againe vnto thée, O
man, that thou dooeſt hate him ſo
much the more, and not loue him
one iot, by how much thou backbiteſt,
and neglecteſt to rebuke him.
                     
                        
Now, what a deteſtable and accurſed
thing the ſlandering of our
neighbour is, the holie Scriptures
in manie places declare: as namelie,
by the mouth of the Prophet
Dauid: Who ſo priuilie ſlandereth
his neighbour, him will I deſtroie.
Againe, He that backbiteth his
brother, backbiteth the lawe. Againe,
He that ſlandereth &amp; backbiteth
his brother, ſhall be rooted
out. And againe, Take héed leaſt
ye be cōſumed one of another, whileſt
ye bite and deuoure one another.
                  
                  
                     3 A praier for the former
vertue.
                     O Almightie &amp; euerlaſting God,
who induedſt thy faithfull ſeruants
the Prophets, with ſuch meaſure
of thy ſpirit, that they diſcharged
their duties with all ſinglenes,
truth, and vprightnes, checking and
rebuking mightie kings for their
tranſgreſſions, according to the tenour

of their commiſſion: as appeareth
in Samuel ſharpelie reproouing
Saule for his rebellion:
in Nathan ſeuerelie rebuking Dauid
for his adulterie: in Ahiiah
roughlie reprehending Ieroboam
for his idolatrie: in Elijah boldlie
checking Ahab for his apoſtaſie: in
Hanani ſtoutlie twiting Aſah for
his miſtruſtfulnes: in Ieremie controlling
Zedekiah for his diſobedience,
and ſo conſequentlie in the
reſt of thy ſeruants both Prophets
and Apoſtles.
                     O take from vs all vaine motions,
which may withdrawe vs from rating
them, that moſt apparentlie
offend thy diuine Maieſtie; and not
to ſeeme blind, or to winke at their
offences, leaſt we be counted partakers
of their wickednes: knowing
that thy ſonne our Sauiour giueth
vs this for a leſſon to be learned &amp;
followed, namelie, when we ſee our
brother commit anie treſpas, to rebuke
him, that he may repent and
obtaine forgiuenes.
                     
                        
Alſo moſt mercifull Father, we
beſeech thee ſo to direct and rule
the courſe of our life, that euerie
member of our bodie may ſet foorth
thy praiſe. And bicauſe the tongue,
though it be but a ſmall peece of
fleſh, is termed a world of wickednes,
and kindleth much miſchiefe,
when it is occupied either in lieng,
forſwearing, backbiting, or reuiling
our brethren: we praie thee to root
out of our harts all ſuch weeds of
ſinne and abhomination, that the
fruits of them may not appeare in
our tongues: through Ieſus Chriſt
our Sauiour, Amen.

inſuing.
                     
                        A Dragon is a cruell &amp; merciles monſter,
ſpitting out fire, and killing euerie
thing that it toucheth: not onelie
beasts of the land, but alſo birds of the

aire: by this dragon, I meane the ſpirit of
wrath and furie.
                     Anger is a naturall affection, but to
them that abuſe this gift of nature, it is a
greeuous &amp; lamentable deſtruction. Let
vs vſe it in things neceſſarie and conuenient,
least dooing otherwiſe, it breake
foorth outragiouſlie into vnlawfull and
vnprofitable deeds.
                     Be not angrie or wrathfull with ſuch
as ſpoile you of tranſitorie goods, which
reuile you, which puniſh and plague you,
&amp; do nothing elſe beſide; but be angrie at
that, which is able of it ſelfe ſo to wound
you; that all theſe things laid togither
can not cure you. And what is it? Euen
your owne ſinne and wickednes. For you
ſhall not feare anie aduerſitie, if you be
not ouerſwaied with iniquitie.

                           O
                         Man, the wrongs
that are doone thée,
thou muſt reuenge,
they are greater thā
thou maieſt quietlie

put vp. It is ſinne, patientlie to
ſuffer them. For this is certaine,
that thy forbearance will neuer a
whit amend the matter, and therefore
ſuch iniuries as are offered
thée, requite to thine owne contentment.
                     If thou bée abuſed in ſpeach,
ſpare him not that hath ſtandered
thée. If thou be ſmitten, ſmite againe.
For it is no man-hood, to be
ſtill &amp; at peace with ſuch as thus
offend thée. Dooſt thou thinke that
thy quietnes will make thine enimie
the better? no; but rather the
more fierce and furious.
                     Thou art taunted, thou art ſcoffed
at, thou art reuiled, thou art
diſcredited, thou art miſtermed;
one calleth thée prodigall foole, another
arrogant aſſe, proud begger,
péeld peaſant, with ſuch like reprochfull
ſpeaches. Are theſe to be
ſuffered? no.
                     And therefore to ſhew thy manhòod,
ſéeke him out by and by that
hath ſo abuſed thée; and in the heate

of thy wrath make him ſmart for
his malapert ſawſines. Some vſe
to beare and forbeare ſo long, till
they become ſtarke fooles and idiots:
be not thou in the number of
them, but in defence of thine owne
quarrell vſe both words and weapons.
                  
                  
                     3 A praier againſt the
former vice.
                     O Moſt mercifull Father, whoſe
propertie it is to be ſlowe to
anger; and haſt taught vs by the
mouth of wiſe Salomon, that anger
is cruell, wrath raging, and
enuie irreconciliable: moreouer,
that it diminiſheth our daies, haſteneth
old age, and ſhorteneth our
life: againe, that it openeth paſſage
to Satan; and therefore haſt commanded
by the mouth of S. Paule,
that the ſunne ſhould not go downe
vpon our wrath: we moſt humblie
beſeech thee, of thine infinite goodnes
and clemencie, remooue from

vs this fowle ſinne of wrath, which
tranſformeth vs from the ſhape of
Angels, to verie diuels and hellhounds.
                     We are not ignorant what a miſchieuous
vice it is, and what inconuenience
it bringeth to the ſoule;
being inſtructed by the words of
wiſedome, that it ſtirreth vp ſtrife,
maketh vs prone to commit ſinne
and villanie; to thirſt for bloud, to
be malicious and merciles: finallie,
that it is execrable and accurſed:
and therefore haſt admoniſhed
vs by thy ſeruant Iames, to be ſlowe
to ſpeake, and ſlowe to wrath; bicauſe
wrath will not ſuffer thy righteouſnes
to be accompliſhed in vs.
And therefore, if we will not haue
thy worke hindered in vs, we muſt
be peaceable and modeſt.
                     O good Lord, open the eies of
our minds, that we may ſee the ouglines
of this monſtrous ſinne, and
ſeeing it may deteſt it, and deteſting
it may deſtroie it, by the aſſiſtance
of thy ſpirit, which is able to worke

in vs a new creation; and an exquiſite
mortifieng of all our fleſhlie
members. Giue vs grace not onelie
to liſten, but alſo to practiſe that
wholſome counſel of the Preacher,
not to be ſwift to wrath, bicauſe
wrath lodgeth in the boſome of
fooles: and to put in proofe the admonition
of our Sauiour Chriſt, not
to be angrie with our brother cauſeleſſe,
for feare of being culpable of
iudgement.
                     O Lord, pull vs backe from keeping
companie with the wrathfull,
&amp; from hauing acquaintance with
the furious; leaſt we learne their
waies, and purchaſe deſtruction to
our owne ſoules. And grant we beſeech
thee, that we may put awaie
from vs all bitternes, anger, wrath,
enuieng, euill ſpeaking, with all maliciouſnes:
and to become tenderharted,
to forbeare and forgiue one
another, euen as thou, ô GOD, for
thy ſonne Chriſts ſake didſt
forbeare and forgiue
vs, Amen.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     1 S. BARNARDS golden
ſentence of the vertue
following.
                     
                        TRue PATIENCE is to ſuffer and
doo contrarie to ones luſt, but not
contrarie to the right of lawe. To abide
and take pouertie in good part, is the vertue
of patience. Patience is the ſafetie of
the ſoule, vnpatience the deſtruction of
the ſame. Who ſo hath not hold of patience,
ſhall looſe righteouſnes, that is, ſhall
looſe life, that is, ſhall looſe his owne ſoule.
                     Looke vpon the ſufferance of the Lord,
who being beaten with whips, crowned
with thorns, bored through with nailes,
hanged on the croſſe, and ouer-burdened
with reproches, forgat all theſe greefes of
his bitter agonie notwithſtanding, and
ſaid; Father forgiue them. Beware therefore,
and take heed that thou periſh not
through vnpatience; but ſuffer all things
for Gods ſake, bicauſe he ſuffered extreame
torments for thy ſake, and thy patience
ſhall not be fruiteleſſe, void, or vnrewarded.
                  
                  
                     
                        2 The REPVLSE giuen by PATIENCE
or forbearance.
                     
                        
                           O
                         Man, if thou call to
mind the paſſion of
thy redéemer Chriſt
Ieſus, there can nothing
happen vnto
thee, be it neuer ſo hard and heauie,
but thou ſhalt be able to beare and
abide it with an humble and quiet
mind. For Chriſt, as S. Peter
ſaith, ſuffered for vs, leauing vs an
example, that we ſhould followe
his ſteps.
                     For he himſelfe hath thus ſpoken:
If they haue called the maiſter
of the houſe Beclſebub, how
much more will they ſo doo vnto
them of the houſhold? Againe, in
another place: If they haue perſecuted
me, they will likewiſe perſecute
you.
                     But what are our ſufferings,
in compariſon of his paſſions? For
he ſubmitted himſelfe to beare reproches,
reuilings, mockings, ſcornings,

buffetings, ſpittings, whippings,
a crown of pricking thorns,
and the accurſed croſſe: and are we
miſerable ſlaues, wearie with a
word ſpeaking, euen to our owne
confuſion and ſhame? Are we diſcouraged?
Are we throwne downe
&amp; put to ſilence with one ſentence?
                     How thinke we of the ſaieng of
S. Paule: If we ſuffer not with
him, we ſhall not reigne with him.
And therefore the prouocations of
wrath muſt be ſuppreſſed and beaten
downe; as the danger thereof,
which is damnation, ought to be
feared. For, he that is angrie with
his brother, is in danger of iudgement.
And, He that ſaith vnto his
brother, Racha, is in danger of a
counſell: but he that ſaith vnto his
brother: Thou foole, is in danger
of hellfire.
                     Now, where may a man find remedie
againſt this deadlie poiſon?
The words following doo ſufficientlie
ſhew: If thou bring thy gift
to the altar, and there remembreſt

that thy brother hath ought againſt
thée, leaue there thy gift before
the altar, and go thy waie; firſt
be reconciled to thy brother, and
then come and offer thy gift.
                     As if he had ſaid: Powre out no
priuate praier ſecretlie in thy hart,
except thou haue firſt made amēds
to thy neighbour, whom thou haſt
miſvſed, and brought him to quietnes
and contentation of mind. For
praier is the gift, which we bring,
and our hart is the altar. He that
endeuoureth thus to doo, as often
as he ſhall perceiue a couple at
ſtrife and variance, by wrath and
anger, dooth not incur the danger
of damnation.
                     But manie there be, which will
not forgiue their offenders, albeit
they ſubmit themſelues, and ſéeke
pardon and attonement. Againſt
thoſe is the ſword of our Sauiour
drawne out, to giue this ſtroke: If
you forgiue not men their offences,
your heauenlie Father ſhall
not forgiue you your treſpaſſes.
                     
                        
Thou wilt ſaie, O man, He hath
miſvſed me manie waies, and oftentimes
he offendeth mée. I ſaie
vnto thée, O man; not I, but the
Lord making this anſwere to Peters
demand, and ſaieng: Lord,
how often ſhall my brother ſinne
againſt me, and I forgiue him?
Till ſeuen times? Our Sauiours
anſwere is this: I ſaie vnto
thée, not ſeuen times, but ſeuentie
ſeuen times.
                     How manie be there, which are
verie ſtowe and ſlacke to releaſe
wrongs done vnto themſelues:
but verie ſwift and haſtie to ſet at
naught ſuch iniuries as they offer
vnto God? And ſometimes it commeth
to paſſe, that vnder a pretence
of taking occaſion to reuenge
iniuries done to God, men are not
aſhamed to reuenge their owne.
Againe, what ſhall we ſaie of ſuch
as in the furie of their blindnes,
breake out into words of outrage,
and fall a curſing? Againſt them
the Apoſtle concludeth in this maner:

Curſed ſpeakers ſhall not inherit
the kingdome of God.
                     Which vice S. Iames deteſting,
to ſet it foorth the more effectuallie,
ſaith: No man is able to tame the
tongue, it is an vnrulie euill, full of
deadlie poiſon. Therewith wée
bleſſe our God and Father, and
therwith we curſe men, which are
made after the ſimilitude of God.
Out of one mouth procéedeth bleſſing
&amp; curſing. My brethren, theſe
things ought not ſo to be; dooth
a fountaine ſend foorth at one hole
ſwéete water and bitter alſo? For
this cauſe it is ſaid elſe-where:
Death and life is in the hands of
the tongue.
                  
                  
                     3 A praier for the former
vertue.
                     O Eternall God, which haſt ſet
before our eies the neceſſitie
of patience and forbearance, by a
view of the contrarie expreſſed in a
parable of an euill debter, whom

his Lord and maiſter remitted for
compaſſion ſake, bicauſe he ſawe
the man vnable to make repaiment:
yet he notwithſtanding meeting
with a fellowe of his, that
ought him but a ſmall ſumme of
ſiluer, void of patience, deſtitute of
mercie, far from forbearance, or
anie ſparke of pitie, caught him by
the throte, and dealt with him in
great extremitie. Whoſe rigorous
and cruell behauiour comming to
the eares of his Lord, was accordinglie
puniſhed.
                     Giue vs, we beſeech thee, better
grace, that we may ſee into our
ſelues, examine our owne conſciences,
and turne-ouer the bils of dets,
which thou moſt fauourablie and
mercifullie haſt cancelled and cut
in peeces, to the end that we taking
thee for an example, might acquit
and forgiue our brother, if there
were anie thing betweene vs: and
patientlie to put vp iniuries and
wrongs, though the fleſh naturallie
doo ſtorme therat, referring vengeance

vnto thee, ô Lord, vnto whom
properlie it dooth belong.
                     O powre into our harts, we beſech
thee, plentie of patience, wherof
alas there is great want in this
our age, as appereth by the coldnes
of charitie &amp; loue, whoſe propertie
it is to be pitifull &amp; long-ſuffering,
to be gentle, courteous, and full of
tendernes: leaſt being forward, irefull,
rough, vnquiet, and greedie after
reuengement, we heare this ſentence
denounced againſt vs; Wo
vnto you that haue loſt patience:
bicauſe it is a neceſſarie vertue, and
greatlie to be regarded; that after
we haue done the will of thee, ô father,
we might receiue the promiſe,
for Ieſus Chriſts ſake, Amen.

                        LET vs watch and ward ouer all our
works, leaſt we ouerſlip the dooing

of that which God commandeth, we commit
that which hee forbiddeth. Let vs
watch and ward ouer our words, leaſt in
vttering them we offend God, or damnifie
and hurt our neighbour. For happie is he,
who in all his communication and talke
hath an eie to theſe two feares; the firſt
of Gods Maieſtie, in whoſe hands it is
horrible to fall; the other of our brothers
frailtie and weaknes, whom it is the eaſieſt
thing of a thouſand to offend.
                     For ſo long as we abide in this earthen
veſſell of fleſh &amp; bloud, we can not be free
from offences. And therefore, if thou remember
that thy brother bee offended
at thee, bee not waiward, but humble
and lowlie to craue pardon. And if thou
haue ought againſt him, be not malapert
in controlling, nor hard to intreate; but
mild in reproouing, and gentle to forgiue,
and all ſhall be well, and at peace.

                           O
                         Man, is it méet that fools,
ſenſeleſſe, &amp; brutiſh beaſts
ſhould be ſmoothed and ſoothed

with faire words? Or rather
is it not more conuenient, that they
ſhould be roughlie rebuked, and
taken vp with bitter and ſharpe
taunts, ſo often as they offend?
For it is not mild ſpéech that can
preuaile with ſuch as lacke iudgement
and reaſon: and therefore to
deale with them in that order, it is
labour ſuperfluous. Take them vp
as one hauing authoritie, for beare
them not an inch, vſe ſuch words
in reproouing them, as are agréeable
to the maner of their dealing.
                     If a woman offend thée, beare not
with hir weaknes: if an old ancient
father, yéeld nothing to his age
or grauitie: if a learned Doctor,
eſtéeme not of his perſon: if thine
equall, hold fowle ſcorne at his
ſawſines: if thine inferior and vnderling,
checke him, and make him
hold his tongue: if thy parents,
alledge thou art no child; and ſo
turne their controlments vpon
their owne necks. Finallie, be hée
better, or be he baſer that rebuketh

thee, forbeare him not, but with
ſtowtnes ſtand in defence of thy
ſelfe.

end the ſame will growe; remooue
from vs, we praie thee, all waiwardnes,

whereas our nature is ſtout, rebellious,

onelie with counterchecks, but alſo

as Ahab did Micah; Manaſſes Eſaie;
Paſhur Ieremie; Herod Iohn

out of our harts, good Lord, that

wicked cuſtome, and let vs not by
refuſing correction, double our offence,
and ſo make it the more odious.
                     Furthermore, moſt mercifull Father,
indue vs with wiſedome and
diſcretion, that we may be led with
the eies of vnderſtanding; to iudge

obſerue due time &amp; ſeaſon of reprehending,

wholſome counſell, miniſtred vnto
vs by thy ſonne Chriſt; namelie,
that if our brother treſpaſſe againſt
vs, we go and tell him his fault priuatelie,
betweene him &amp; vs; if that
will doo no good toward the winning

procure his open ſhame. This leſſon

o Lord, giue vs grace to learne; and
not onelie to learne, but alſo to remember;
and not onlie to remember,
but alſo to exerciſe and folowe:
that the end of our labour beſtowed
according to thy will, may tend

                        PReſumption and obſtinacie are the
waies of diuels; flie from them, ô man,
leaſt thine enimie triumph ouer thee. For
in theſe ſinnes he reioiceth exceedinglie,
hauing made proofe in himſelfe, how vnpoſſible
it is to recouer, and get out of
ſuch a gaping gulfe.
                     Now I would not haue thee ignorant, ô
man, what are the ſteps of this downe-fall,
or breake-necke: the firſt is the diſſembling
of thine owne weaknes; the ſecond

the ignorance of thine owne wretchednes;
the third is the excuſing of thine owne
wickednes; and the fourth is open contempt
and perſeuering in ſinfulnes.
                     Which ſteps, if thou wilt not tread in, ô
man, nor be ſwalowed vp in this irrecouerable
whirlepoole of deſtruction, deſpiſe
not good counſell; diſdaine not to be rebuked;
but mildlie and meekelie take
warning when thou doceſt amiſſe; and
when thou art rebuked of ſinne and vngodlines,
take it in good part on Gods
name, and beare it patientlie with the ſpirit
of ſoftnes and gentlenes.
                  
                  
                     2 The REPVLSE giuen by
MEEKENES, or gentlenes.
                     
                        
                           O
                         Man, this perſuaſion
may in no caſe be
followed. For it is
flatlie againſt the
counſell &amp; aduiſe of
the Apoſtle, who admoniſhing his
beloued ſcholler Timothie in this
behalfe, ſaith: Rebuke not an elder,
but exhort him as a father: the

yoonger men as brethren; the elder
women as mothers; the yoonger
as ſiſters, in all chaſtitie.
                     Againe, The ſeruant of the Lord
muſt not ſtriue, but be gentle vnto
all men, apt to teach, ſuffering euil,
in méekenes inſtructing them that
are contrarie minded. Againe,
Improoue, rebuke, exhort in all
long ſuffering and doctrine. This
vice of waiwardnes, or malapert
controiling, doth more hurt to the
baſer ſort, than to the better; to
the ſubiect, than to the magiſtrate.
For it cōmeth to paſſe oftentimes,
that they contemne correction and
reprehenſion, vſed &amp; vttered with
mildnes, loue, and charitie: and againſt
words ſpoken with humilitie
&amp; lowlines, they will not ſticke
to ſhoote the ſhafts of ſhameles deriſion
and ſcorning.
                     Herevpon it is thus written in
Scripture: Who ſo reprooueth a
ſcornefull perſon, getteth himſelfe
diſhonour. Againe, Reprooue not a
ſcorner, leaſt he owe thée euill will.

Contrariwiſe, of him which amendeth,
when he is reprooued, and is
the better being rebuked, it is thus
ſpoken: Rebuke a wiſe man, and
he will loue thee.
                  
                  
                     3 A praier for the former
vertue.
                     O Lord, which from time to time
haſt placed among thy people
meete &amp; conuenient veſſels to carrie
the meſſage of thy word &amp; will,
that thereby they might be inſtructed
&amp; taught, how damnable their
ſtate is, during the time of their pilgrimage
in wicked waies, and bypaths
of impietie; and haſt diſperſed
and ſowne among vs plaine tell
troth Nathans, to reprooue vs of
our iniquities and ſinnes: giue vs
grace, we beſeech thee, that the
preaching of the one, and the reproouing
of the other, may worke
vpon vs, like new made waxe, apt to
receiue anie faſhion or forme.
                     O plant in vs a patient ſpirit,

which may make vs lowlie in hart;
and reformable in will; that the
words of the admoniſher may not
paſſe by vs like a ſudden blaſt of
wind, but rather worke effectuallie
in our harts, euen like fire, which fineth
ſiluer by the vertue of his
heate. Remooue from vs all rebellious
motions of the fleſh, which are
euer againſt the good ſuggeſtions
of the ſpirit: &amp; direct vs in the waie
of wiſedome, that we may take and
chooſe whatſoeuer is wholſome for
vs, yea though the taſte thereof be
as bitter as woormewood to the
mouth of our carnall man.
                     We knowe, ô Father, that to purge
abundance of corrupt humours,
which ingender euill diſeaſes, the
phyſician miniſtreth bitter pils: &amp;
to an old ſore, which can not be cured
with a gentle plaſter, the ſurgeon
applieth a biting corſiue:
which medicines, though to the patient
moſt greeuous and painfull;
yet in conſideration that they are
preparatiues to health, they are receiued,

well taken, and ſuffered. And
therefore ô Lord vouchſafe vs the
grace of thy holie ſpirit, wherby we
being guided, conducted, and gouerned,
may not murmur at the admonitions,
reprehenſions, and corrections
of our brethren, though
they rebukes vs ſharpelie: but may
moſt thankefullie take their reproofes,
knowing that the end and
ſcope of their labour ſo imploied, is
for the edification of our ſoules in
Chriſt Ieſus, to whom be praiſe for
euermore, Amen.

                        SWelling loftines is a ſelfe-liking of
ones owne excellencie, and hath attending
vpon hir two waiting maids broken
to hir owne bowe, the one is blind pride;
the other vaine pride: whereof the firſt is
a fault of the vnderſtanding, the ſecond of

the will. For by that, the eie of reaſon is
deceiued; and by this, the deſire of will
abuſed.
                     Blind pride maketh a man beleeue he
is better than he is; whereby he ſwelleth in
the opinion of his owne excellencie, boaſting
of himſelfe, and giuing no glorie at
all vnto God.
                     Vaine pride bewitcheth a man in ſuch
ſort, that he braggeth, not onelie in that
which he hath, but in that which he hath
not; and is more delighted in his owne
commendation, than in the praiſe of God.
But why ſwelleſt thou, ô dirt and doong?
Why art thou loftie? All fleſh is graſſe,
and all the glorie thereof as the flowre of
haie. He that planteth is nothing, nor he
that watereth. What haſt thou that thou
haſt not receiued, and why then art thou
ſo loftie?

buſines to doo, anie affaires
in the world to
deale in, anie matter

wherin to meddle, to it with a good
ſtomach, and feare not the face or
looking on of anie maner of perſon.
Followe thine owne counſell and
determination. For, another mans
wit is not ſo good, but thine may
be much better.
                     And therefore abaſe not thy ſelfe,
but compare with the beſt. Let not
thine opinion and iudgement bée
ſchooled by anothers aduiſe and
conſultation. What ſhouldeſt thou
ſubmit thy ſelfe to the cenſure of
men? Haſt thou not God in heauen

thou care, what men ſuſpect and

our ſoules and bodies, which thou
haſt created to ſet foorth the glorie
of thy moſt holie name.
                     And bicauſe, good God, there are
manie conueiances of vices in our
harts, and manie holes and corners
for ſinnes of ſundrie ſorts to lurke
in, the leaſt wherof deſerueth death
and condemnation: we moſt humblie
craue of thy diuine Maieſtie,
that it would pleaſe thee to cruſh
out of our entrailes, as out of a

defilings, as haue, euer ſince the

and ſoupling, to the vtter putrifieng
&amp; conſuming both of ſoule

                     Speciallie moſt mercifull Father,
be vnto vs ſo good a phyſician, as to
miniſter but one dram or ſcruple of
thy grace, that ſwallowing the ſame
downe into the ſtomach of our
ſoules, we may vomit and ſpue out
all ſwelling loftines, which puffeth
vs vp like wind blowne into a bladder.

O heale vs thou moſt carefull
and cunning leach of mankinde,
which knoweſt, and onelie vnderſtandeſt
what maladies are incident
to this our mortalitie, &amp; with
what medicines they are to be expelled.
                     Suffer not ſo dangerous an humor
to abound in vs, leaſt ouer-ruling

be brought at laſt euen to the gates

Pharao, Antiochus, Herod, &amp;
the reſt of that ambitious &amp; proud
race were, euen at the verie ripenes
of their pompe, when they thought
all things ſafe and in perfect ſecuritie.
Wee craue it ſo much
the more inſtantlie, ô Father, bicauſe
thou haſt threatened to caſt
downe the high mountains, and to
make them eeuen with the lowe
plaines: to lop the tall ceders of
Libanus, and to make them equall
with the baſe bulruſh: that thou
onelie maieſt be honoured in thine

excellencie, and that all creatures
ſtooping vnto thee, may do homage
and reuerence to thee their Creator.
Humble me, ô Lord, in this maner,
and pull downe the pinacles of
my proud hart, that my ſoule may
be made a manſion for thy Maieſtie
to dwell in, thy Sonne to abide in,
and the holie Ghoſt to continue
in: to whom be all honour and power

bicauſe I am the waie; to me, bicauſe I
am the life. Againe he ſaith, Who ſo will

vs, bondage, baſenes, &amp; hardnes. Bondage
in denieng himſelfe, baſenes in taking vp
the croſſe, hardnes in following Chriſt;

whoſe life was tempered with no kind of
worldlie pleaſure.
                     By this we are taught to humble our
ſelues, and to be lowlie in our owne eies; to
be reformed when we are rebuked; and not
to hold ſcorne of correction, when we are
blame-woorthie. For the waie to be perfect,
is to learne how to amend that which
is vnperfect: if we neglect this, we ſhall
neuer come to that.

admoniſheth thée, that thou

oughteſt not to giue anie occaſion

                     Which thing the Apoſtle deteſted
euen in them, that knowing the
Chriſtian faith, ſat downe notwithſtanding
to eate meates offered
vnto idols. And although they
eſtéemed an idol as a toie, or a thing
of naught: yet, taking vnto them,
and taſting idolatrous meates, as
altogither harmeles, and nothing
at all offenſiue, they did tie the
weake conſciences of their vnſtaied
brethren, to the damnable rites
and ceremonies of idols, by this

                     O Almightie &amp; euerlaſting God,
which from the beginning of
the world, haſt throwne the thunderbolts
of thy iuſtice and vengeance
at ſuch, as obſtinatelie haue
continued in their ſinne, without

remorſe of conſcience, or feare of
thy iudgements; we moſt humblie
beſeech thee, to heare the praiers of
vs thy ſeruants, and to grant the petition
of our lips. O deliuer vs not
ouer into the rule of Satan our
ghoſtlie enimie, leaſt he make a
ſpoile of our ſoules, and feede on
them, as a falcon vpon a dooue, or
as a woolfe vpon a lambe.
                     Be thou the gouernor of our life,
and the directer of all our deeds,
that we may walke in the waies of
thy lawe, and tread the paths of thy
cōmandements: out of which when
we wander and go aſtraie, neglecting
the conduction and leading
of thy grace, we fall into the temptation
of the diuell, and beecome
outcaſts from the Commonwealth
of Iſrael, exiles and outlawes from
the teſtament of the couenant, and
haue our names ſcraped out of the
regiſter booke of euerlaſting life.
                     Let vs intreate thee therefore, ô
moſt mercifull God, by the mediation
and interceſſion of thy Sonne

we aſke, euen an humble ſubmiſſion

may ſtrike downe all

                     We knowe, ô Father, the commodities
depending vpon this bleſſing,
to be not onlie ſingular, but alſo
manifold. For when we offend, it
worketh in vs an inward ſorowe for
ſinne, a greefe for diſhonor done to
thy Maieſtie, a care of conſcience, a
purpoſe to amend, and a deſire to
be reconciled. When we are rebuked,
it maketh vs take warning
gladlie, thinke vpon our offence
ſadlie, lament the ſame earneſtlie,
repent in hartilie, craue pardon vnfeignedlie,
and walke euer after
more circumſpectlie: through Ieſus

naturallie graffed therein, not blameable,
if it be meaurable; but offenſiue, if it
be exceſſiue. And therefore to torment
thy ſelfe with too much ſorowe, and to refuſe
comfort for the loſſe of things temporall,
which come and go like the tide,
is extreame madnes. Awaie with that
worldlie and vngodlie ſorowe; for God
hath no pleaſure therein. If thou wilt
knowe what ſorowe pleaſeth the Lord, I
tell thee it is ſorowe for ſinne, which is ingendred
of repentance, &amp; begetteth righteouſnes.
                     The remedie againſt this ſorowe, that
it breake not beyond the bounds of moderation,
and ſo degenerate into deſpaire, is
Gods vnſpeakable mercie; euen his mercie,

which is aboue all his works. As for

nothing in the world

Conſider thine owne heauines &amp;

                     In this perplexitie, where is thy
comfort, where is thy conſolation,
thy lightnes of hart, and mirth of
mind? It were much better for
thée to forſake all, and to die, that
theſe torments might ceaſe: than
enioieng life, to ſuffer a continuall
increaſe of ſuch coreſiue and eating
cares. For he, whom gréefe
and heauines hath ſwallowed vp,
receiuing no delight in anie viſible
thing, muſt néedes looke for a lamentable

former vice.
                     O Eternall God, in whoſe power
it is to make the weake ſtrong,
the ſicke ſound, the poore rich, and
the heauie merrie: we knowe, and
by experience haue fealt this to be
true, that diſordinate heauines hindereth
that which is good, and maketh

entrance vnto that which is
euill. And therefore the wiſe mans
aduiſe is woorthie, not onelie to be
learned, but alſo to be followed:
namelie, not to giue our minds to
heauines, nor to vexe our ſelues in
our owne counſell. For as the ioie
of the hart is the life of man, and
his gladnes the prolonging of his
daies; euen ſo ſorrowe is his death,
and heauines ſhorteneth his time.
                     Againe, Salomon telleth vs, that
by ſorowe of hart, the mind is made
heauie, the bones dried vp, and the
bowels conſumed; as moths fret a
garment, and woormes eate into
wood: yea, there is no plague like
it, no vexation comparable therewith,
no anguiſh of greater torment:
conſidering that it diſquieteth the
conſcience, and draweth manie a
one into the pit of deſperation: as
appeareth in Cain, Saule, Iudas, &amp;
other reprobates, giuen ouer and
caſt out from thy fauour and grace.
                     From this heauines, good Lord
defend and deliuer vs; for it is the

waie to endles wo, to perpetuall
tribulation, and irrecouerable miſerie.
As for that ſorowe and heauines,
which thine Apoſtle Paule, by
his preaching kindled in the Corinthians,
and reioiced that he had
made them ſad: we beſeech thee
make vs partakers thereof, that
thereby wee may be led to repentance,
and drawe neerer and neerer
to the benefit of our ſaluation. This

death, as we are neerer vnto hope

following.
                     
                        IN all the changes and chances of this
life, which are manie and diuerſe; in all

tribulation and anguiſh, it is thy part, ô
man, to hold faſt the anchor of hope, if
thou wilt arriue at the port of peace. And
if thou wilt liue quietlie in Chriſt Ieſu,
make full reckoning to ſuffer affliction;
and though thou bee ſharpelie touched
both in bodie and mind, yet perſuade thy
ſelfe, that after long ſufferance commeth
deliuerance, and that theſe chaſtiſements
confirme thy conſcience, that thou art
one of Gods houſhold.
                     Reioice in aduerſitie, beare all caſualties
patientlie, lament thy ſinne ſorowfullie,
but beware of being heauie deſperatelie.
Comfort thy ſelfe with the memorie of
Gods mercie, who in due time will giue
thee a Quietus eſt from all theſe earthlie
troubles. Finallie, when thou art moſt
greeuouſlie aſſalted with ſorowe, lighten
thine hart with thinking vpon theſe two
notable conſolations; firſt, Chriſts
death and paſſion; ſecondlie,
the vnſpeakable ioies
of the life to
come.
                  
                  
                     
                        2 The REPVLSE giuen by godlie
reioicing, and ſpirituall
COMFORT.
                     
                        
                           O
                         Man, I knowe that
of heauines there are
two kinds, the one
worketh to ſaluation,
the other to damnation:
the one draweth to repentance,
the other to deſperation.
Thou art aſſaulted with one of
them, not with that which worketh
vnto life, but with that which
worketh vnto death. Thou maiſt
not be ſad and heauie, in ſuch ſort
as thou art perſuaded; but contrariwiſe,
if thy ſorowe and heauines
ſpring from ſome externall cauſe,
as for that art enuied and hated
for the truths ſake, thou oughteſt
to reioice in theſe thy gréefes?
                     And why? Bicauſe thou not
knowing to what iſſue they will
growe, art notwithſtanding to be
comforted by the voice of the giuer
of euerlaſting ioie &amp; gladnes,

ſpeaking thus vnto thée: Bleſſed
are you, when men ſhall reuile you,
and perſecute you, and lieng ſhall
ſay all maner of euil ſaieng againſt
you for my ſake. Reioice ye, and be
glad, for great is your reward in
heauen.
                     Remember alſo, O man, that
the Apoſtles, the fore-runners of
this religion, departed from the
face of the Councell, reioicing that
they were counted woorthie to ſuffer
ſhame and reproch for the name
of Ieſus. No place therfore ſhould
be giuen vnto gréefe and heauines,
where ſuch ioie and gladnes inſueth.
                     If thy ſorowe and anguiſh, O
man, procéed from the remorſe of
conſcience for thy ſinnes, remember
a multitude of offenders, that
by repentance haue obteined mercie
at Gods hands, according to
the truth of his promiſe: In what
daie ſoeuer a ſinner dooth repent
him of his ſinne and wickednes, I
will put all his iniquitie out of

my remembrance, ſaith the Lord.
Againe, Though thy ſinnes were
as red as ſkarlet, yet will I make
them as white as wooll: &amp; though
they were as filthie as the menſtruous
cloth of a woman, yet will
I make them as white as ſnowe.
                     Remember, O man, the mercifull
Semaritan in the Goſpell,
that powred wine and oile into the
ſicke mans wounds, ſet him on his
owne aſſe, brought him to an inne,
and paid for his neceſſaries. Remember
the good Shepheard, that
ſought the loſt &amp; wandering ſhéepe,
&amp; hauing found him, brought him
home to the ſhéepe-fold vpon his
ſhoulders.
                     Remember the bountifull King,
that making a ſumptuous banket,
ſent abroad his ſeruants, to bid
gueſts of all eſtates and degrées
vnto the ſame. Remember the kind
and louing Father, that hauing an
vngratious ſpend-thrift to his
ſonne, fell vpon his necke notwithſtanding,
at his returning ſorowfull

for his fault, and put him in
poſſeſſion of the fulneſſe of his fauour
againe, which before by his
riotous behauiour he had loſt.
                     If thy heauines, O man, procéed
from the conſideration of thy poore
eſtate, from the remembrance of
thy loſſes by ſea or land, from vnthankfulnes
of affinitie and kindred,
from frowardnes of children,
from wilfulnes of wife, from vnfaithfulnes
of ſeruants, learne patience
of Iob: The Lord giueth,
and the Lord taketh awaie, euen
as it pleſeth the Lord, ſo let things
come to paſſe.
                     Learne of thy Sauiour Chriſt
to ſubmit thy will to Gods will,
and to ſaie: Thy will be done in
earth, as it is in heauen. Thus arming
thée with ſpirituall furniture,
thou ſhalt not be heauie either
to deſperation or damnation, but
ſorowfull to repentance and amendement,
and ſo conſequentlie
thou ſhalt find ioie and
comfort.
                  
                  
                     
                        3 A praier for the former
vertue.
                     O Bountifull God, the Father of
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, whoſe
eies of mercie and louing kindnes
are alwaies open, and broad waking
ouer thy ſeruants, ouerſeeing them,
that none inconuenience or euill
thing inuade them; not the arrowes
of the hunter at noone-day, nor the
dangers of the darts of darknes at
mid-night; we beſeech thee of thine
infinite goodnes and clemencie, to
continue thy fatherlie affection and
fauour at all times, ſpeciallie in the
time of perſecution, trouble ſorowe,
need, and aduerſitie, that we
may not waxe heauie-hatred in our
tribulations; but reioice rather and
be glad, perſuading our ſelues, that
by the fire of afflictions thou trieſt
thy children like ſiluer, and fineſt
them, that they may be made fit
and woorthie coine to receiue the
ſtampe of their Creator and King.
                     
                        
Giue vs patience, good Lord,
to ſuffer whatſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe
thy heauenlie wiſedome to laie vpon
our ſhoulders; according to the
example of thy ſeruant Iob, who eſcaping
no kind of aduerſitie that
might happen to the bodie of man,
his ſtate, condition, credit, and abilitie,
did not reuile thee, nor yet
curſe thee to thy face, although he
was greeuouſlie tempted of Satan
by thy permiſſion, and ſorelie aſſalted
of his wicked wife, to renounce
thee his maker, and ſo to end his
miſerable life; but bleſſed and praiſed
thy diuine Maieſtie, ſuppoſing it
neceſſarie to receiue euill at thine
hands, as well as good.
                     Euen ſo, ô eternall God, and moſt
mercifull Father, if it be thy will at
anie time to chaſtiſe vs, either with
ſicknes, pouertie, or anie other kind
of aduerſitie, vouchſafe therewithall
to arme vs with contentation of
mind, quietnes of conſcience, and
conſolation of ſpirit, that we may be
ſo far from being diſcomforted in

our tribulations, that we rather triumph,
and be ioifull in the midſt
of them, building our hope vpon
the promiſe of thy ſonne Ieſu Chriſt
our Sauiour, who propheſieng that
in this world we ſhould weepe and
lament, mourne and be ſorowfull,
willed vs notwithſtanding to bee
comforted, ſaieng: that The time
ſhould come, when our heauines
ſhould be turned into ioie, and that
our ioie ſhould be full: which grace
ô GOD grant, for thy mercies ſake,
Amen.

ſentence of the vice
inſuing.
                     
                        IDLENES is the mother of vice, and
the ſtepdame of vertue, and therefore
eschue idlenes, and enure thy ſelfe to labour
and exerciſe, ſo ſhalt thou quicklie
feele an appetite or deſire after ſuch food,
as may kill hunger, and not deintie▪ or delicate

in taſte. For labour and exerciſe
maketh ſuch things toothſome, as ſlothfulnes
maketh lothſome.
                     Thou wilt be glad, ô man, of manie a
morſell, after bodilie labour and exerciſe,
which thou thoughteſt ſcorne of, when
thou wert idle and vnoccupied. For idlenes
breedeth lothſomnes, but labor ingendreth
hunger: which hunger doth make
diuerſe hard meats maruellous ſauourie,
that lothſomnes made vnſauourie.
                     Herbs, roots, beanes, peaſe, crible bread,
and thin water, are lothſome to an idle
perſon; but to the labouring man, they
are delicates and i
                           •
                        nkets. So that idlenes
is an enimie to the bodie, which while it
attainteth, the mind can not be kept vndefiled.
                  
                  
                     2 The ASSALT giuen by ſlothfull
IDLENES.
                     
                        
                           O
                         Man, art thou called
to be a churchman,
and to liue deuoutlie
in praieng or
reading? I wiſh thée

to fauour thy ſelfe, and beware of
ſuch hurtfull exerciſes. For if thou
accuſtome thy ſelfe to continuall
reading, remember the danger depending
thervpon. Thine eies are
but tender, and therefore if they
ſhould be oppreſſed with too much
looking vpon bookes, they would
quickly waxe blind. Againe, if thou
vſing deuoutlie to praie, ſhouldeſt
be touched with ſorowe, and ſo
giue thy ſelfe dailie to wéeping and
ſhedding of teares, what will ſooner
put out thine eies than that?
                     If thou ſhouldest faſt, and thereby
labour to bring thy fleſh into
ſubiection, thou wilt be ſo weake
and féeble, that before thou be old,
thou ſhalt bée faine to go with a
ſtaffe. If thou ſhouldeſt accuſtome
thy ſelfe ordinarilie to watching;
why that is ſuch a peſtilent thing,
that in verie ſhort time thy brains
waxing light, and thine head out
of quiet, thou wilt run ſtarke ſtaring
mad.
                     Againe, if thou be called to the

trade of a craftſ-man or labourer,
take héed thou hurt not thy ſelfe
with too much paine and trauell, be
not too earneſt, be not too quicke, be
not too carefull, be not too diligent,
be not too buſie about thy trade,
leaſt thou fall into ſome bodilie infirmitie
and ſicknes, whereby thou
pining and conſuming awaie, ſhalt
come in danger of death. And therfore
let ſpirituall exerciſes alone;
and as for bodilie buſines, meddle
as little therewith as thou maiſt.
                  
                  
                     3 A praier againſt the
former vice.
                     O Louing God, the Father of our
Lord Ieſu Chriſt, whoſe will &amp;
pleaſure it is, that we ſhould not be
wearie of well dooing, plucke out of
our harts, we moſt humblie beſeech
thee, all maner of carnall and idle
motions, counſelling vs to the contrarie.
Speciallie, good Lord, remooue
from vs the filthie vice of
ſlothfull idlenes, whereby we are

made vnfit for anie Chriſtian exerciſe,
withdrawne from praieng and
faſting, which are the meanes to
pull downe and tame the wantonnes
of this yoong heifer our fleſh.
                     Suffer not ſo deteſtable a ſinne to
regne in vs, to beare ſwaie in our
earthlie members, and to carrie vs
head-long into ſecuritie and careleſnes;
leaſt whiles we be lulled aſleepe
in the cradle of ſenſualitie,
and make full reckoning that all is
ſafe, we be ouertaken in our ſinnes,
and ſuffer due puniſhment.
                     Giue vs grace to followe the
wholeſome aduiſe of our Sauiour
Chriſt, giuen to his diſciples; namelie,
to watch and praie, which are
meanes to preuent &amp; auoid temptations:
taking him for an example
to followe, whoſe life was nothing
elſe but a continuall meditation of
godlines, which if we could frame
our ſelues to imitate, we needed no
better ſchoolemaiſter to inſtruct vs
in the waies of righteouſnes and
ſanctification.
                     
                        
Let vs be ſtirred vp, we praie thee,

in ſpeech and communication, in
behauiour and life, eating &amp; drinking,
riding, running, ſitting, going,
walking, and working: that the
whole courſe of our conuerſation
may be acceptable in thy ſight, our
thoughts, words, and deeds ſetting
foorth the glorie of thy name
with one voice and conſent.
                     That we may doo this effectuallie,
to the true worſhipping of thy

people, and the conſolation of our
owne ſoules; vouchſafe to ſet ſtrife

and all the world, we may be reckoned
at the laſt and generall audit,

                        THis is the ſumme of vertuous &amp; ſpirituall

godlie endeuour; wiſelie to diſpoſe and
order things preſent, penitentlie and in

miſdeeds paſt, and carefullie to prouide
and fore-ſee things to come.
                     Liue ſoberlie, iuſtlie, and godlie, ſaith
the Apoſtle, in this world: ſoberlie, in reſpect
of the time preſent; iuſtilie, in reſpect
of the time paſt, which we muſt redeeme,
by making amends for the neglect
of our former thrift; &amp; godlie, in reſpect
of the time to come, ſetting it as a ſheeld
to defend vs from all inſtant dangers, and

hazards that may happen hereafter.
                     I would to God we were wiſe for the ordering
of our life present; for the amending
of our life paſt; and for leading the
rest of our life to come, in vnfeined faith
to God-ward. For this is the thred of
three twists, whereby we are drawne to
ſaluation: namelie; an orderlie conuerſation;
an vpright iudgement; and a
faith vnfeined.

                           O
                         Man, prolong no
time, neither driue
off from daie to daie,
but whiles thou haſt
ſpace doo thine indeuour
to liue honeſtlie, painfullie,
vertuouſlie, and deuoutlie. Folowe
thy vocation, whether it be ſecular
or eccleſiaſticall; appertaining to
worldlie affaires, or belonging to
the ſpirit. Canſt thou tell, O man,
whether thou ſhalt liue till to morowe?
Haſt thou a leaſe of thy life

from the Lord? Naie, marke what
I ſpeake; art thou able to ſaie, that
thou ſhalt liue one houre to an end?
                     Is the ſaieng of thy Sauiour
Chriſt out of remembrance, mentioned
in the Goſpell: Watch; for you
knowe not the daie nor the houre.
Wherefore ſhake off all ſlothfulnes
of bodie, and all idle cogitations of
mind: and let this leſſon be freſh
in thy memorie dailie, that ſuch as
offer violence, and ſnatch at the
kingdome of heauen by force, ſhall
haue it in poſſeſſion: it is none inheritance
for ſuch as are lukewarme,
neither hot nor cold, ſoft
and effeminate perſons, wantous,
nice, idle, and ſlothfull.
                     Followe the counſell of the Apoſtle;
to praie continuallie, to
make ſupplications vnto GOD
without ceaſing: not forgetting
this, that he which ſtirreth vp ſuch
good motions in thine hart, is ſufficient
&amp; able to giue thée ſtrength
&amp; might to perseuere in the ſame.
                     Be earneſt in praier, zelous, feruent,

&amp; continuall. For, that which
the fleſh accounteth too much, the
ſpirit contrariwiſe iudgeth too little:
conſidering that Satan is
tempting vs dailie and hourelie, to
ſift vs as it were wheate.
                     Who preſerued the eie-ſight of
Dauid, wéeping and wailing for
his ſinnes? Who ſtrengthened the
Niniuets faſting and praieng at
the preaching of Ionas? Who
made Paule able to paſſe through
his long peregrination in Aſia?
Did not the Lord? Why then, O
man, doubt not of thine eies, of thy
lims, of thy bodie, or of thy mind.
For God by his grace will worke
that in thée, which ſéemeth hard
and vnpoſſible to the nature of fleſh
and bloud.

who haſt placed vs in this
world for two ſpeciall ends and

purpoſes; firſtlie, to glorifie thee in
our life and conuerſation, directed
by the rule of thy holie lawes and
commandements; ſecondlie, to doo
good one to another, as brotherlie
loue and charitable affection dooth
moue and exhort vs: knowing that
in theſe two points the two tables
of thy diuine precepts doo ſummarilie
conſiſt, according to the teſtimonie
of thy ſonne our Sauiour,
who in few words did knit vp the
ten commandements; namelie, in
louing thee, ô Lord, with all our
harts; and our neighbours as our
ſelues. O vouchſafe vs the aſſiſtance

our ſelues daie and night in the
meditation of thy lawe, and frame
the courſe of our life according to
the preſcript rule of thy word, and

                     Let thy grace ouerſhadowe vs,
yea Lord, let it fill vs wholie and
ſolie, that we may tread in the footeſteps

Cornelius that deuout captaine of

exerciſe was in the feare of thee,
and the honour of thy holie name,

to ſet foorth thy glorie: but he eſpeciallie,
who by his continuall praier,

alms-deeds, grew in great fauour
with thee, &amp; receiued the aſſurance
of ſaluatiō, by the teſtimonie
of a pure and vndefiled conſcience.
                     We knowe, ô Father of mercie,
and God of all conſolation, that
thou requireſt a kind of diuine ſeruice
at our hands, proper &amp; peculiar
to thy Maieſtie, which is, to worſhip
thee in ſpirit and truth. This we
are bound by dutie to exhibit and
ſhew thee: as alſo all other exerciſes
of Chriſtianitie, conſiſting in
loue and charitie, we are charged
in thy lawe to teſtifie vnto men. O
giue vs the grace, we beſeech thee,
to doo it, for Ieſus ſake, Amen.

that thou maist ſerue him onelie,
and keepe thy ſelfe for him alone, of whom
thou hast made thy ſpeciall choiſe aboue

abroad; refuſe common meetings; forſake

haue nothing to doo with the multitude:
flie the companie of men and women; forget

                           O
                         Man, conſider with
thy ſelfe that thou
art a creature borne
to libertie, and not to
ſeruice: let thy mind
therefore run vpon choiſe and varietie;
tie it not to one ſpeciall place,
or one proper practiſe. The world
is wide, and full of people, their cuſtoms
are diuerſe, and their maners
not alike.
                     Thou ſhalt learne that abroad,
which thou ſhalt not ſée at home;
the ſundrie faſhions of countries;

their kind of gouernment &amp; Commonwealth;
their order of diuine
ſeruice and religion; and other obſeruations
not vnneceſſarie. And
why then ſhouldſt thou not vſe the
benefit of libertie, and paſſing from
place to place, ſée and learne, as
well for thine owne pleaſure, as for
others example?
                     If thou beléeue that God is euerie
where, that all the corners of
the earth are repleniſhed with his
greatnes; why then dooeſt thou ſo
preciſely bind thy ſelfe to one place,
to one ſeruice, to one religion, to
one cuſtome, to one tradition, to
one order; and dooeſt not rather
ſéeke what is abroad?
                  
                  
                     3 A praier againſt the
former vice.
                     O Lord God, Father of light, we
giue thee moſt hartie thanks
for thy great loue and clemencie
declared vnto vs, in ſtopping the
ſwift courſe, which thou by thy diuine

fore-ſight perceiuedſt vs readie,
not onelie to take, but alſo to
keepe: humblie beſeeching thee to
kindle in our harts an inward hatred
againſt looſe libertie and licentiouſnes,
knowing the miſchiefs
therevpon depending to be ſuch, as
that they doo not onelie ingender
thy diſhonour, but alſo our owne
ſhame and confuſion.
                     Examples hereof we haue manie
in the ſacred Scriptures, and ſpeciallie
that of Dinah Iacobs daughter,
vpon whoſe wandering &amp; ſtraieng
abroad to ſee the pleaſures of a
ſtrange land, and the faſhions of
yoong damſels; there dwelling; not
onelie the loſſe of hir honeſtie, but
alſo the ſhedding of much bloud
did inſue. Let this, ô Lord, be a ſufficient
warning vnto vs, that by libertie
there commeth more euill
than good: naie, rather no good at
all. For it openeth a free paſſage
vnto manie vices, which otherwiſe
might be ſuppreſſed with reſtraint.
                     What the cauſe ſhould be of ſo

manie ſtrange innouations and diſguiſings,
not onelie in apparell, but
alſo in behauiour, and not onelie in
behauiour, but alſo in opinion and
beleefe, thou knoweſt, and we confeſſe
to be nothing but licentious
libertie; whiles ſome not content
with the cuſtoms, trades, maners, affaires,
vſages, and orders of their
owne natiue countrie, doo let looſe
their ſtraieng affections with their
wandering bodies, and learne in
prophane places, among vncircumciſed
people, of polluted harts and
tongues, moſt abhominable abuſes,
tending altogither to the derogation
of thy glorie, the breach of chriſtian
vnitie, peace and concord, the
defa

                        tion of the Goſpell, the offence
of manie a weake conſcience,
and the vtter confuſion of a thouſand
thouſand ſoules.
                     Turne our harts, ô Lord, that we
affect not, couet not, deſire not this
deteſtable libertie, which though
to the fleſh, and the wild luſts of the
ſame, it be delectable and pleaſant;

yet to the ſoule it is moſt damnable
and noiſome. Deliuer vs from it, ô
Lord, for it is the nurſe of vanities:
ô deliuer vs from it for thy mercie
ſake, and for thy beloued ſonnes
ſake, our Sauiour and redeemer Ieſus
Chriſt, Amen.

ſentence of the vertue
following.
                     
                        THere is nothing more vnstable and
wauering, nothing more ſwift and
flitting in thee, ô man, than thine owne
hart, which ſo often as it ſtumbleth at the
ſtone of euill thoughts, ſo often it offendeth
God. Thy hart is vaine, variable, and
vnſearchable; and ſo often as it is led by
it owne will and conſent, ſo often it wanteth
Gods counſell. It is like a bird flieng
out of hir nest, like a ſhip lanching into
the deepe, like an arrowe ſhot out of a
bowe. And what is the cauſe of this vnſtablenes?
euen lacke of trust in God.
                     Trust in God, ô man, and continue in
thy place; beleeue in him, affie thy ſelfe on

his goodnes, and thou ſhalt obtaine contented
ſtaiednes. A foole changeth and altereth
like the moone, but a wiſe man abideth
firme and fast like the ſunne: a
foole wauereth like a reede, but a wiſe
man ſtandeth ſtill like a ſtrong oke: a foole
is compared to the wandering ſtarres,
which are euer moouing; but a wiſe man
is likened to the fixed ſtarres, which keepe
their appointed places. For the first the
miſt of darknes is prepared; for the ſecond
the cleerenes of light is ordeined.

                           O
                         Man, if the caſe
ſtand as thou ſaieſt,
and confeſſeſt, that
God is eueriewhere,
then is it thy dutie to
kéepe thée where thou art, and not
to forſake that place, which thou
wouldeſt ſo faine change for another:
bicauſe God is in it, by his
greatnes, which filleth euery place.
But thou wilt ſaie, O man, I

ſeeke for a better, and I find a better.
But I anſwere thée, and ſaie
thus againe vnto thée with boldnes
and truth: Thou ſéekeſt a better
place, but dooeſt thou find a better,
or ſuch a one as thou knoweſt
Lucifer and Adam loſt?
                     Remember therefore that the
firſt angel fell from heauen, and the
firſt man was baniſhed out of paradiſe,
&amp; became acquainted with
the troubles of this world. Looke
vpon Lot, who liuing among the
thickeſt of the beaſtlie Sodomites,
and ſéeing their filthie behauiours,
remained holie notwithſtanding &amp;
vndefiled: but when he came to
dwell in the mountaine, and had
growne hard in ſecuritie, he became
drunke, and fell into the filthines
of inceſt with his owne
daughters.
                     Marke alſo, O man, what miſchiefs
followed looſe libertie in Dina
the daughter of Iacob, who not
contended to tarrie at home, but
deſiring to ſée fine faſhions abroad,

among the yoong women of Sichar,
was intiſed to plaie the
whoore: and therevpon inſued
ſlaughter and bloud-ſhed by the
hands of Simeon, Leui, and their
aſſiſtants.
                     There is beſide this kind of looſe
libertie, another licentious wandering,
which worketh in the
minds euen of ſuch as kéepe themſelues
in one place, and withdraweth
their harts from ſpirituall exerciſes,
intangling them in affaires
of the world, or elſe finding them
occupied in moſt vile and homelie
things, contrarie to the counſell of
the Apoſtle in this caſe, who ſaith:
No man that warreth, intangleth
himſelfe with the affaires of this
life, that he may pleaſe him, which
hath choſen him to be a ſouldiour.
And againe, Praie
without ceaſing, in
all things giue
thanks.

                     O Euerlaſting GOD, the wellſpring
of all true wiſdome and
vnderſtanding, whoſe will &amp; pleaſure
it is, that we ſhould walke in obedience
before thee all the daies
of our life, brideling the vanities of
our minds, the ranging luſts of our
fleſh, the concupiſcence of our eies,
and whatſoeuer is at enimitie and
variance with thee: we beſeech thee
to beate downe in vs all wild and
vnſtaied affections, which wreſtle
againſt the ſpirit, &amp; hinder vs from
dooing that homage vnto thy diuine
Maieſtie, which we are inioined
by the verdict of thy moſt holie
word.
                     And bicauſe experience teacheth
vs, that no ſmall miſchiefe ariſeth
and ſpringeth from looſe libertie,
whiles we not content with our natiue
countrie cuſtome, hunt after
not onelie foren faſhions in outward

maners, but alſo new deuiſed
opinions in doctrine and beleefe:
wee beſeech thee tie our harts in
one vnitie of faith, as there is but
one truth of thy Goſpell: and expell
and driue out of our minds all
deſire of licentiouſnes, which is the
match to ſet on fire the powder of
fantaſticalnes.
                     O let vs not ſtraie about to Dan
and Bethel, ſuffer vs not to go on
pilgrimage to Babylon and Rome:
but let thy grace be a ſnaffle in our
mouth, to keepe vs within the wals
of holie Ieruſalem, there to worſhip
thee in thy ſanctuarie in ſpirit and
veritie. And as we craue an vniformitie
in matters of religion, ſo Lord
we beſeech thee, to make vs of one
mind in maners and behauiour, to
be content with a reuerent and modeſt
vſe of thy creatures, and not to
abuſe them to the fulfilling of our
owne vaine imaginations.
                     Of our ſelues we are like wandering
weather cocks, as vncertaine as
the wind, as variable as the weather,

as mooueable as the ſea: now
inclined to this vanitie, now to
that fantasie, neuer ſtedfaſt, but euer
changable: and therefore, good
Lord, open our vnderſtanding, that
we may ſee how irregularlie &amp; out
of rule we walke: and ſeeing it, may
be aſhamed; &amp; being aſhamed, may
be greeued, and being greeued, may
ſeeke to be reformed; euen by thy
ſpirit of conſtancie, which is able to
worke in vs a continuall and immutable
perſeuerance, through Ieſus

                        DESPERATION breedeth a ripenes,
fulnes, and perfection of all ſinne.
Deſperation commeth by the ignorance of
God. If the ignorance of God haue hold of
vs, how doo we beleeue in him, how doo we
hope in him, how doo we trust in him, of
whom we are ignorant? We knowe alſo,

that ſuch as are deſperate, haue no part
or followſhip with the Saints.
                     But how doth the ignorance of God ingender
deſperation? Some man peraduenture
comming home to himſelfe, being
diſcontented, and diſpleaſed at the euill
deeds which he hath done, and purpoſing
to repent, and turne backe from all his
euill waies, and carnall conuerſation; if he
be ignorant how good God is, how ſweete,
how gentle, and how fauourable to forgiue;
will not his conſcience choked with
fleſhlie thoughts, reprooue him, and ſaie,
What dooſt thou man? wilt thou looſe not
onlie this life preſent, but alſo the life to
come?
                     Thy ſinnes are exceeding great, and too
too manie, ſo that it is far aboue thy reach
to make amends for them anie waie: no,
if thou wouldest flea thy ſelfe, and pull
thy skin ouer thine eares; thou art not
able to acquit thy ſelfe. Thy fleſh is tender
and nice, thy life hath beene delicate
&amp; wanton, ſo that it will be an hard matter
for thee to ouer-maister custome.
                     At theſe and the like ſpeeches, or ſuggestions,
the deſperate ſoule ſtarts backewrapped

in wo, being vtterlie ignorant
how eaſilie the goodnes of almightie God,
who will not the death of a ſinner, can remedie
all this: wherevpon followeth impenitence,
which is an heinous ſinne, and
blaſphemie vnpardonable.
                     Then the ſeelie ſoule troubled in mind,
and ſore diſquieted, is ſwalowed vp with
an extreame heauines of hart, and is carried
headlong into ſo deepe a gulfe of inward
anguiſh, as he can not poſſiblie recouer
himſelfe, by the ministerie of anie
comfort: or elſe diſſembling the matter,
and flattering himſelfe, how wicked ſoeuer
he be, with likelie reaſons, and pleaſant
perſuaſions, he betaketh himſelfe afreſh
to the world, enioieng all the delights
and vanities of the ſame, with full purpoſe
neuer to be withdrawne from it by
anie meanes.
                     Now when he ſaith, peace and quietnes,
all is well, and without danger; then,
euen then ſudden destruction ſhall ouertake
him, as a woman with child, and he
ſhall not eſcape. Thus then of the ignorance
of God, commeth the fulnes of all
iniquitie, which is deſperation.

thou haſt cōmitted?
How gréeuous, how
accurſed, how abhominable,
how deadlie, how damnable?
Thine offences are ſo manie,
that they can not be numbered; and
ſo great, that they may not be pardoned.
Thou haſt continued a
tranſgreſſor all thy life long, and
haſt not to this daie once thought
vpon amendement.
                     For behold, thine owne conſcience
is a witnes, that thou art tied
with the chaine of euill cuſtome to
commit wickednes, and haſt not in
thée the power to be withdrawne.
Thou ſtriueſt &amp; ſtruggleſt to riſe,
but it is not in thée. And why?
The burthen of thy ſinnes is ſo
heauie, and kéepe thée vnder ſo
ſore, that thou falleſt downe againe
as ſoone as thou art halfe vp. In

this caſe what is to be done?
                     The miſdéeds whereof thou art
guiltie, the tranſgreſſions wherein
thou art filthilie fallen, the ſinnes
which haue gone ouer thy head are
ſo manie and ſo great, that thou art
certainlie damned alreadie, without
all hope of redemption. This
is the reward due for thine offences
paſt; as for thy preſent faults,
thou haſt not the grace granted
thée to forbeare or forſake them,
vnles thou wilt looſe the pleaſures
of this world, &amp; looke for the conſolations
of the life to come, which
thou art not like to obtaine, bicauſe
thou art ſecluded from the ſeate of
Gods fauour, and therefore deſperate,

haſt planted vs in thy vineyard, to

plentie of grapes; that is to ſaie, to
lead a life ſo adorned and inriched
with good works, as thou thereby
maiſt be glorified: giue vs grace, we
moſt humblie beſeech thee, to pull
backe and withdrawe our feet from
the wicked waies of the diuell, the
world, and the fleſh: and direct our
ſteps in the paths of thy holie will,
which is the rule to righteouſnes,
and the line to godlines and innocencie.
                     And bicauſe, ô Lord, it is thy nature
and propertie to abhor ſinne,
little or much, conſidering the integritie
and perfection of thy diuinitie,
which is commended in Scripture
to be ſuch, that the verie heauens
are counted vncleane in thy

true knowledge and vnderſtanding,
that therby we may be lead as
by a bright burning lampe, out of
the darke lanes of ignorance, wilfulnes,
obſtinacie, peruerſenes, and
ſuch like.
                     Eſpeciallie deliuer vs from falling

into the deepe dungeon of deſperation,
whereinto the diuell, by
vpbraiding and caſting in our teeth
the horrour of our iniquities, dooth
what he can to driue vs; that by ingendering
a conceit of miſtruſt in
thy mercie and compaſſion for the
remiſſion of our ſinnes, we ſhould
ſtumble at the ſame ſtone of reprobation,
wherat Cain ſtumbled; who,
when he had imbrued his hands in

did ſo vainelie thinke of thy

not containe himſelfe, but by the
outcrie of his tongue, bewraied the
miſtruſt of his hart, ſaieng that his
ſinne was more heinous, than that
thou couldeſt pardon it by thy
mercie.
                     O Lord, preſerue and keepe vs,
during the time of our nauigation
in the ſeas of this troubleſome life;
leaſt thou, who art the Pilot of the
pinneſſe, wherein thy people paſſe
through the narrowe ſtreights of
death, withholding thy hand, and

like potſheards. Defend vs from
ſlipping into the pit of perdition
with Iudas, that child of wrath and

ſleepeth most ſweetlie vpon the ſoft
bed of loue, vnderlaid with patience. In
hope we liue, least we ſhould faint in afflictions
preſent, looking for the ioies,
which ſhall last for euer. God will not
diſappoint them that hope in him, but

will helpe and deliuer them: why ſo, and
for what deſarts? Bicauſe they hoped in
him.
                     A ſweete cauſe, verie effectuall, pithie,
and paſt reuoking. Not to diſappoint
them that hope in him, is a most comfortable
reward, a rich gift, a bountifull largeſſe.
For God refuſeth not to be the hope
of the miſerable, bicauſe he is mercifull:
he diſdaineth not to ſhew himſelfe a deliuerer,
but he will be a protector and defender
alſo of them that hope in him.
                     Behold man, reckon vp thy tribulations
by number, his conſolations ſhall
make glad thy ſoule; if thou turne not to
other by-helpes, if thou crie out vnto him,
if thou hope onlie in him. For in all temptation,
in all vexation, in all time of neceſſitie,
the citie of refuge is readie to receiue
vs, the boſome of the Father is wide
open for vs, the holes of the ſurest rocke
doo gape for vs to run into, the bowels

was notwithſtanding, through the

hairie locks, kiſſed, licked, and annointed

                     Looke alſo vpon Peter, who by

tangled himſelfe in the cords of

he did paſſe from the croſſe,
where he hoong with ſhame and

ioie and felicitie.

                     Séeing therfore, O man, ſo manie

In what daie ſoeuer a ſinner

And againe, I will not the death

that the thing which a man neglecteth
to doo to day, let him be carefull
to doo to morowe, whiles he
hath life in him, and time to repent
and amend.
                     Let him not prolong and driue
it off from daie to daie; but hauing
helpe of God from heauen, and aſſiſted
with the ſpirit of ſanctification,
let him doo his endeuour dailie

to withſtand the euill cuſtome of
ſinne, and let him ſay with the prophet
euerie morning and euening:
Behold, I haue now begun; the
right hand of the Higheſt hath
wrought this alteration &amp; change.
                  
                  
                     3 A praier for the former
vertue.
                     O Pitifull Samaritan, which didſt
ſo lament our diſtreſſed caſe,
when wee were wounded with the
inuenomed darts of ſinne, that thou
vouchſafedſt to heale vs, euen by
applieng the moſt comfortable plaſters
of thy hart bloud to our deſperate
ſores: ô heare the praier and
ſupplication which wee powre out
before thy mercie-ſeat; beſeeching
thee of thine accuſtomed kindnes,
ô louing Ioſeph, to make vs rich in
vertue &amp; godlines: ſpeciallie, bring
our harts into the ſafe rode &amp; harbour
of hope, where lieng at reſt,
they can take no harme.
                     And although our ſinnes, like hie

growne ſeas, doo ſwell and lift vp
themſelues ouer our heads; inſomuch
that with their violent rage,
they ſeeme to threaten the renting
in ſunder of the gables of our anchor
hold, &amp; ſo to ſinke the ſhip of
our confidence, wherein we wiſh to
be carried into the port of thy promiſes,
neuer failing them that repoſe
their vndoubted truſt in thee,
which art yea and Amen to all the
flocke of the faithfull: yet notwithſtanding
we ſaie, as that good King
ſaid: Thy mercie, ô Lord, ſurmounteth
all thy works: and with the
Prophet in his lamentations: It is
thy mercie, ô Lord, that we are not
conſumed: and with the Apoſtle;
Thou art rich in mercie, ô God.
                     And bicauſe hope is ſo neceſſarie,
ô ſweete Sauiour, that without it
we cannot be ſaued, knowing that it
is one of the vertues, which muſt
aduance &amp; prefer vs vnto thee, (for
in faith, hope, and charitie, conſiſteth
the obteining of perfect felicitie)
we beſeech thy goodnes to ſtabliſh

and ſtrengthen the ſame in vs,
to ſowe it plentifullie in the ſoile
of our harts, that it may ſhoote forth
&amp; ſpread abroad like a palme tree,
to the endles comfort of our ſoules
and conſciences.
                     Thou being ſo gratious and fauourable
vnto vs, it can not be, but
that in all tempeſts of troubleſome
thoughts, raging in vs through the
ſting of our ſinnes, and bringing vs
out of quiet; we ſhall preſentlie apprehend
thy promiſe, encouraged
by a liuelie hope; and running from
wickednes, as from the ruine of a
rotten wall, be erected, ſupported,
and vnderpropped with the firme
foundation of thy faithfulnes, which
neuer faileſt the conſtant beleeuer,
truſting to thy word, and building
thervpon, as vpon a moſt firme and
vnſhakeable foundation: but performeſt
the vttermoſt of thy couenant,
euen to the third and fourth
generation of them that loue thee,
and keepe thy commandements:
which to obſerue, and liue thereafter,

giue vs grace, ô Chriſt, for thy
mercie ſake, Amen.

ſentence of the vice
inſuing.
                     
                        COVETOVSNES hath the chiefe
rule and highest place in matters of
robberie, craft, deceit, and wrongfull dealing:
he rideth in a wagon of foure wheels,
the firſt baſe-mindednes; the ſecond crueltie;
the third contempt of God, and the
fourth forgetfulnes of death.
                     Moreouer, the beasts that drawe this
wagon, are hold fast, and catch all; both
which are ruled by one waggoner, whoſe
name is deſire to haue more. For couetouſnes
being loth to ouercharge himſelfe
with hiring manie ſeruants is content
with one, though he be neuer ſo ſimple.
                     The waggoner is nimble at his buſines,
and neuer complaineth of wearines:
hauing in his hands two whips, wherewith
he yerketh the drawing-beasts; the one

called greedie of getting, the other feare of
loſing. This couetouſnes is one of the princes
or peeres of the great &amp; mightie monarch
of the ſpirituall &amp; inuiſible Egypt.

COVETOVSNES.
                     
                        
                           O
                         Man, be carefull of
thy ſelfe, and ſéeke all
the means thou canſt
to increſe thy welth;
it is good huſbandrie
to haue a regard to thine owne
commoditie and profit. Haſt thou a
ſtocke of monie? Put it out to vſurie;
take for the loane, not as the
borrower is able to affoord for his
benefit, but for thine owne contentment
and ſatiſfaction.
                     Haſt thou houſes &amp; tenements?
Let them out after ſuch a rate, and
vpon ſuch conditions, that thou
maiſt be a great gainer by the bargaine;
and that the tenant by thy
fore exaction of rent, may be eaten
out of houſe and home, and ſo thy
tenement returne againe into thy

hands.
                     Haſt thou farms in the countrie,
arable lands, paſture and medowe-ground?
Put it to other
mens occupieng, and make monie
of all, paieng thée yéerli and quarterly
ſuch round ſummes vpon extreame
couenants, as thou maieſt
be ſoone inriched by ſuch dealing.
                     If thou haue cattell of thine
owne, let them féed on the common:
for why maiſt not thou vſe that libertie,
which is granted to another?
Haſt thou ſonnes or daughters
to beſtowe in mariage? Séeke
not after them that be poore, though
they be honeſt and vertuous; comlie
and handſome; wiſe, ſober, and
modeſt; well brought vp, and of
good behauiour: but prouide for
thy ſonnes, ſuch wiues as haue
not onlie wealthie kindred, but alſo
great dowries; &amp; let the ſame care
be in thée for thy daughters in like
maner.
                     Furthermore, if thou ſée a commoditie,
which thou art in loue

withall, and thinkeſt the ſame fit
for thée, diſburſe ſo much monie as
will compas it, be it office in court,
citie, or countrie, thou maieſt make
thy bargaine againe in ſuch ſort,
that thou néedeſt not looſe the value
of a ruſh.
                     Let nothing ſcape thée, if thou
ſée it be for thy behoofe. For this is
no couetouſnes, but carefull prouiſion,
when a man hath in ſtore to
ſerue his turne in time of neceſſitie.
And better it is, that a thing in
anothers kéeping and ill vſed, were
in thy hands diſcréetlie to occupie,
than to let ſuch a one haue it, as
knoweth not what belongeth to
ſuch a commoditie.
                  
                  
                     3 A praier againſt the
former vice.
                     O Eternall GOD, who of thy
goodnes openeſt thy bountifull
hands, and filleſt all liuing
things with the dew of thy bleſſing;
we beſeech thee to roote out of our

harts all doubt and misbeleefe of
thy vniuerſall prouidence, which in
nothing ſo much, as in the horrible
ſinne of couetouſnes appeareth; and
therfore, good Lord, weane vs from
it, as the nurſe weaneth the ſucking
child, hanging vpon his breaſts:
leaſt the venemous milke of ſo vglie
and deteſtable a vice, ouer long
remaining and continuing within
vs, we growe full of infection, and
fall into the diſtreſſed ſtate of the
Iewes; of whom the prophet complaining,
reporteth that from the
crowne of the head to the ſole of
the foote, there was no ſound place,
but all ouer irkeſome, with ſcabs,
vlcers, biles, and running ſores.
                     We knowe this vice, ô Lord, to be
a vice ſo derogatorie to the honour
of thy name, as none more. For, it
maketh them, in whom it hath poſſeſſion,
idolaters, and image-worſhippers:
whiles they hauing more
cōfidence in corruptible creatures,
neglect in the meane time, that peculiar
truſt and aſſured hope, which

ought properlie and alonelie to be
repoſed in the power of thy prouidence.
The puniſhment wherof was
moſt ſharpelie executed vpon Achan,
who coueting, contrarie to
thine expreſſe commandement, excommunicate
things, which his
greedie eie beheld in the ſpoile,
was ſtoned to death.
                     But no example more terrible
&amp; fearfull doth the Scripture commend
vnto vs, than that of the traitor
Iudas, who became ſo vile a
bond-ſlaue to the deſire of monie,
that after he had ſold his maiſter,
euen thy ſonne our tender Sauior,
into the hands of tormentors, griped
and gnawne with the woorme
of a ſtormie conſcience, he accuſed
himſelfe to haue betraied innocent
bloud, and therevpon throwing
downe the ſiluerlings, he conuaied
himſelfe awaie in the vexation of
his mind, and deſperatelie hanged
himſelfe.
                     Conſidering this ſinne therfore, ô
moſt mercifull Father, that it is an

hinderer of vs from poſſeſſing the
kingdome of heauen, a procurer of
violence, oppreſſion, &amp; bloud-ſhed,
a gulfe inſatiable, and a thing not ſo
much as to be once named, or
heard of among Saints, we moſt
humblie beſeech thee, to deliuer vs
from it, not for anie woorthines or
merits in vs; but for the paſſion
of thy deerlie beloued ſonne Ieſus
Chriſt, our onlie mediator and aduocate,
Amen.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     1 S. BARNARDS golden
ſentence of the vertue
following.
                     
                        THE deceitfull pompe of this world
is deſeruedlie refuſed, and the glorie
thereof woorthilie deſpiſed. It is the floure
of haie; &amp; a ſmoke that lasteth but a
while. The best ſtate thereof, whatſoeuer
it be, dooth it not bring more anguiſh and
vexation, than pleaſure or delectation?
Whiles, ô man, thou purchaſest, whiles
thou vſurpest, whiles thou defendest,
whiles thou maintainest, whiles thou

grudgest, whiles thou repineſt, whiles thou
ſuſpectest, whiles thou art alwaies liking
and louing that which thou hast not; and
hauing gotten diuerſe things, ſtill deſirest
more with a greedie mind, what rest is in
thy glorie? If there be anie, the pleaſure
thereof paſſeth awaie, and is neuer like to
returne to thee; but the griefe and anguiſh
thereof abideth, and is neuer like
to leaue thee. Neuertheles, thou maist ſee
that manie lacke it, and few ſet light by
it: why? trulie bicauſe need is in manie,
and vertue in few.
                     O wicked world, which art woont ſo to
bleſſe and preſerue thy friends, that thou
makest them Gods enimies; and conſequentlie,
vnfit for the felowſhip of Saints!
For doubtles, he that will be thy friend, is
made Gods enimie: and therfore a friend
of the world, is ſhut out from the companie
of Gods friends. When the ſpirit is
once tasted, the fleſh must needs looſe his
ſauour; to him that hungreth after heauenlie
things, earthlie things are not
toothſome; to him that longeth for eternall
things, tranſitorie things are lothſome.
For all the pleaſure of this world, all

the glorie therof, and whatſoeuer is deſired
and ſought for therein, is verie little, in
reſpect of that bleſſednes, of that happines,
of that honour, of that glorie; if it
may be vouch ſafed to be counted little,
or rather nothing.
                     O ye ſonnes of Adam, ye couetous and
ambitious generation; giue eare and
marke. What haue you to doo with earthlie
riches, and temporall glorie, which indeed
are no true riches, nor yours to poſſeſſe?
True riches are not the wealth of
the world, but the vertues of a good conſcience,
which it beareth about, for the
perpetuall inriching of it ſelfe.
                     The ſhortnes of the world is certaine;
but the end of the ſhortnes thereof is vncertaine:
oftentimes they forſake the liuing,
and commonlie folowe the dead. The
pleaſure, the delight, and comfort of the
world is baſe, vile beggerlie, and good for
nothing: yea rather (a thing much to be
feared) it is a blocke or let to true and
wholſome comfort. For what is there in
this life, but labour and trauell, griefe, anguiſh,
and vexation of mind?
                     Thou wouldest faine eate, bicauſe hunger

torments thee: they both are a paine
and labour; but bicauſe hunger is the
greater and grieuouſer, thou thinkeſt that
it is no paine &amp; labour to eate. But afterwards
when hunger is killed; tell me then
if thou countest it not a greater and grieuouſer
thing to eate, than to be hungrie.
                     In this caſe are all things vnder the
ſunne, ſo that nothing is pleaſant or comfortable
in verie deed: but man will paſſe
from one to another, to be releeued by
change. For the remedie of one labour or
paine, is the beginning of another. There
is no wicked perſon in this world, that can
haue what he will. The righteous man
can not be ſatiſfied with righteouſnes; the
v
                           •
                        luptuous man with voluptuouſnes; the
curious man with curiouſnes; the ambitious
and vaine-glorious man with vain-glorie.
                     But wo be to them, that hunt after
vaine and flitting glorie. For whiles they
ſeeke to haue ioie and delight in tranſitorie
things, that ioie and delight can not
but paſſe awaie, with the verie things
themſelues whereof they ſpring. For as fire
faileth, when wood is wanting; ſo vaniſheth

the world, and the concupiſcence of
the ſame: and no doubt the ioie, pleaſure,
and delight thereof dieth withall. Let
the worldling therefore ſee and vnderſtand;
let him marke and conſider; bicauſe
the end of his ioie is mourning
and lamentation. For this is the meed of
tranſitorie pleaſure; this is the frute of
temporall glorie.
                  
                  
                     2 The REPVLSE giuen by the
CONTEMPT of this
WORLD.
                     
                        
                           O
                         Man, theſe things
are not brought to
paſſe of worldlings,
without great danger
and offence; bicauſe
the more a man hath, the
more he coueteth: ſo that he hath
no meaſure in his deſires, whiles
he maketh haſte to become a verie
ſeruant or ſlaue to innumerable
cares of this life. For as the
Scripture verifieth: A couetous
man is neuer ſatiſfied with monie.
And what a deteſtable thing couetouſnes

is, S. Paule declareth
in theſe wordes: Couetouſnes,
which is the worſhipping of images,
or idolatrie. The ſame Apoſtle
ſhewing what a miſchéefous thing
it is, ſaith: They that will be rich,
fall into temptations, and ſnares
of the diuell, and manie noiſome
luſts, which drowne men in deſtruction
and perdition. The wiſe
man alſo noteth, how hurtfull the
vice of couetouſnes is to them
that be infected therewith, ſaieng:
There is nothing more wicked,
than a couetous man. And Saint
Iames to the ſame purpoſe, vſeth
this ſpéech: Go to now ye rich
men, wéepe and howle in the miſeries
which ſhall come vpon you:
your riches are corrupt, your garments
are moth-eaten, your gold
and ſiluer is cankerd, and the ruſt
thereof ſhall be a witnes againſt
you, &amp; ſhall eate your fleſh like fire.
                     Our Sauiour Chriſt alſo, ſéeing
what miſchéefe it is, would not
in anie caſe ſcale vp ſuch a ſinne in

ſilence. For theſe are his words
written by the Euangeliſt: It is
hard for a richman to enter into
the kingdome of heauen.
                     Againe, It is eaſier for a camel
to paſſe through the eie of a néedle,
than for a richman to enter into the
kingdome of heauen. If therefore
couetouſnes in the harts of worldlings,
be ſuch a plaguie and peſtilent
infection: what ſhall we think
thereof, if it be found in them that
haue taken their fare-well of the
world, and bequeathed themſelues
wholie to the Lord? To ſuch ſpeciallie
are the words of our redéemer
Chriſt directed in the Goſpell,
whereby the ſicknes of couetouſnes
might be cured. Be yée not
carefull (ſaith our Sauiour) what
ye ſhall eate, or what ye ſhall drink,
or what ye ſhall weare. For after
all theſe things doo the Gentiles
ſéeke. But firſt ſéeke the kingdome
of God, and the righteouſnes therof,
and all theſe things ſhall be giuen
you. O bleſſed lsaeing, void of

care, and woorthie to be imbraced!
For there is none liuing ſo frée
from care, as he which deſireth to
poſſeſſe nothing beſide Chriſt. For
vnder the condition of this promiſe,
he is allowed to haue all ſuch
neceſſaries as he dooth lacke. As
S. Paule the poore, and yet rich
Apoſtle ſaith: As hauing nothing,
and yet poſſeſſing all things. All
things, not for ſuperfluitie; but for
neceſſitie, as he prooueth in theſe
words: Hauing food and raiment,
let vs be therewith content. But
thou wilt ſaie peraduenture, O
man, It is requiſite that religious
and godlie men ſhould haue more
in poſſeſſion (riches I meane, and
other vtenſiles) than other priuate
houſholders, conſidering that
they beſtowe them better, than the
common people, in reléeuing the
poore &amp; néedie members of Chriſt
Ieſu, and ſuch like works of charitie.
I allow thy ſaieng, O man:
but yet to pull vp couetouſnes by
the hard rootes, as well out of the

harts of the one as the other, I refer
all eſtates to the example of
Lots wife, to terrifie them from
ſetting their minds vpon ſuch a
vile ſinne. Shée departing from
among the Sodamites, and forbidden
to looke backe, was turned
into a piller of ſalt; and ſo gaue vp
the ghoſt, bicauſe ſhe did not as ſhe
was inioined by commandement.
                     Wherevpon Chriſt giuing a
watch-word to beware of the like,
ſaith: No man putting his hand to
the plough, and looking behind him
is fit for the kingdome of heauen.
To the ſame effect S. Peter vſeth
theſe words: Better were it for
ſuch neuer to haue knowne the
waie of righteouſnes, than after
the knowledge thereof, to be turned
from that which was deliuered
them by an holie commandement.
Vnto theſe men agréeth
the old, and not ſo old as true prouerbe:
A dog returning to his vomit,
&amp; a ſow to walowe in the mire.
                     The nature of this diſeaſe of cocouetouſnes

is ſuch, that the readieſt
and ſpéedieſt waie to ouercome
and killir, is continuallie to thinke
vpon death, and euerie minute of
an houre to conſider, what ſhall be
the ſtate of a man verie ſhortlie after
he is laid in his graue. This
was alwaies fixed faſt, and déeplie
grauen in his memorie, that vttered
this ſentence: Man is but corruption,
and the ſonne of man but a
woorme.
                     This was neuer out of his mind
who ſaid: whatſoeuer thou takeſt
in hand, remember the end, &amp; thou
ſhalt neuer doo amiſſe. To what
purpoſe then dooth the couetous
worldling gather goodes? They
will ſtand him in no ſtead in the
daie of wrath. Harken, O man, to
the voice of Iob: Naked came I
out of my mothers wombe, and naked
ſhall I go thither againe. Liſten
alſo to the words of the Apoſtle:
we brought nothing into this
world, neither can we carrie anie
thing out of the ſame.
                  
                  
                     
                     3 A praier for the former
vertue.
                     O Eternall and immortall God,
we beſeech thee, that the life of
thy deerlie beloued ſonne, and his
diſciples, during the time of their
ſoiourning in this earth, the verie
inne of iniquitie, may be prouocations
vnto vs, to ſpend the remnant
of our flitting age in ſinglenes of
hart, innocencie, and all vertuous
conuerſations: that hauing before
our eies ſuch liuelie examples of
godlines, we may declare in our
deeds a fruitfull imitation of them
before the face of all men.
                     And bicauſe it is a true ſaieng of
thy ſeruant S. Iames, that Whoſoeuer
is a friend to this world, is an
enimie to God: and that of S. Iohn,
that The whole world is ſet vpon
miſchiefe; and that of thy Sonne
Ieſus Chriſt, that The world knoweth
thee not, neither can receiue
the ſpirit of truth, which is the

holie Ghoſt: therefore wee moſt
humblie craue this at thy hand, ô
heauenlie Father, that it will pleaſe
thee to beſtowe vpon vs a due portion
of thy grace, whereby we may
growe into a great contempt of the
world, and a bitter deteſtation and
lothing of the vaine delights thervpon
depending; following herein
the example of thine Apoſtle Saint
Paule, who counted the things that
were vantage vnto him, meere loſſe
for Chriſts ſake: yea all things but
loſſe for the excellent knowledge
ſake of Chriſt Ieſus, for whom he
eſteemed all things little woorth,
yea he iudged them no better than
doong, that he might win Chriſt.
                     And although the neceſſities of
this life, be ſo vrgent and manifold,
that oftentimes the world allureth
vs vnto hir loue: yet vouchſafe vs
of thy mercie, the light of ſound
iudgement and reaſon, that we may
hang wholie vpon thy prouidence,
and vſe this world, as if we vſed it
not: knowing that thy ſonne our

Sauiour and redeemer, deſcended
from heauen into the earth, was
crucified, dead, buried, roſe againe,
and aſcended into heauen, to the
intent that he might deliuer, and ſet
vs free from this preſent wicked
world, than whom we haue not a

ſentence of the vice
inſuing.
                     
                        WHAT is a hard hart? A hard
hart is that onlie, which feareth
not it ſelfe, bicauſe it feeleth not it ſelfe.
It is euen that which is not pricked with
remorſe, touched with pitie, mooued with
intreating, warned by instruction, ſtirred
with threatening, but woorſe by correction.
It is vnwilling to doo good, vnthankfull
for benefits receiued, vnfaithfull in

keeping counſell, cruell in giuing iudgement,
ſhameles in committing filthines,
deſperate in dangers, rude in mens affairs,
raſh in Gods matters, forgetting things
past, neglecting things preſent, not foreſeeing
things to come.
                     As for vncharitablenes, it is void of
all pitie; it neither clotheth the naked,
lodgeth the houſeles, feedeth the hungrie,
refreſheth the thirstie, comforteth the ſorowfull,
instructeth the ſimple, forgiueth
iniuries, forbeareth vengeance, or exerciſeth
ſo much as one worke of mercie or
compaſſion. And therfore wo to the hardharted,
wo to the vncharitable. For as
they haue ſowne, ſo ſhall they reape.
                  
                  
                     2 The ASSALT giuen by hardnes
of hart, or VNCHARITABLENES.
                     
                        O Man, it is good thou
wert wiſe and ſparing,
niggardlie and
ſauing. Manie are
mooued with mercie
at the complaints of the poore and
miſerable, ſome are pitifull to priſoners,

ſome to ſpitties or hoſpitals,
ſome to ſchooles and vniuerſities,
ſome to ſocieties or corporations:
which reléefe they themſelues
lacke before they die, and
learne, euen with gréefe of hart,
what a follie it is to giue a thing,
which they themſelues once had,
and might haue kept it: but now
when they would can not get it.
                     If thou ſhouldeſt diſtribute in
this ſort, who would diſtribute to
thée in thy diſtreſſe? Thy mercie
will be counted but méere madnes;
and thine alms-déedes vtter follie.
Doo therefore as I teach thée, and
thou ſhalt be ſure to haue in ſtore
for thy néed againſt a déere yéere.
Eſtéeme of thy penie as much as
another will doo of his pound; if
the cries of the poore ring about
thine eares, paſſe by, and ſaue that
reléefe, which peraduenture ſhould
be but ill ſpent, or rather lewdlie
caſt awaie.
                     For the alms of ſome, is ſo vndiſcréetlie
beſtowed, that it is not

to be counted a deed of charitie; but
rather a worke of wickednes. And
why? The verie end giueth proofe
ſufficient. Bicauſe a number ſéeking
none other ſhift to liue, but
truſting to the ſtaffe of others ſuccour,
are nouriſhed in idlenes and
ſloth; neglecting honeſt trades,
which if they were folowed, would
maintaine and find them ſufficiencie
of all neceſſaries.
                     Learne this leſſon therefore, O
man, not to giue at all; and ſo ſhalt
thou be ſure to plaie a wiſe part.
For in giuing, as well as in not
giuing, a fowle fault may be committed:
and a little ſpared, is better
than a great deale ill ſpent. Againe,
thou muſt conſider, that it is
not for thée, hauing a charge of
children and ſeruants, to be lauiſh
or liberall. For thou maieſt giue ſo
long, that nothing will be left to
maintaine thy wife and familie.
                     The ſumme of my counſell therfore
is this. Though thou be well
grounded in the world, and haſt

laid a good foundation of thy wei
                           •
                        h
and ſubſtance; yet ſtaie not at that
ſtep, but go certaine degrées further.
For, to a building, though the
foundation be chéefeſt and moſt
néedfull: yet there be other things
required, before it can growe to
perfection, or merit to be called by
the name of a houſe.
                     Euenſo, though by carefull thriftines
thou haue gathered a good
ſtocke, and art indifferentlie well
prouided for againſt the time of
néed: yet if thou haſt not as great
a regard to kéepe that, which thou
haſt gotten, and to increaſe it with
continuall diligence; all will conſume
and waſte awaie like ſnowe
againſt the ſunne.
                     Aboue all things therefore beware
of giuing, where nothing is
to be reſtored againe: and let not
thine hart be ouercome with the
cries and lamentations, which enter
in at thine eares, leaſt it happen
to thée as I haue
fore-told thée.
                  
                  
                     
                     3 A praier againſt the
former vice.
                     O Moſt tender &amp; louing Father,
we moſt humblie beſeech thee,
that we remembring the words of
thine apoſtle S. Paule, to wit, Whatſoeuer
is written, is written for our
learning, may caſt the eies of our
memorie vpon the mounting ſins
of Sodom, which were pride, fulnes
of bread, abundance of idlenes, and
contempt of the poore: and being
terrified with thy heauie iudgment
powred out of a full viall of thy
vengeance, euen to their vtter deſolation
and conſuming with fire
and brimſtone, may hate and deteſt
to the death, all kind of iniquitie,
eſpeciallie the ſinne of vncharitablenes,
againſt the which thou art
ſo mortall an enimie, as thou art a
neere friend to mercie.
                     O giue vs not ouer to the inordinate
luſts and deſires of our owne
depraued nature, which is more

prone to bring foorth ranke and venemous
weeds, than good &amp; wholſome
herbs. And let the bright
morning ſtar of thy grace ſo ſhoote
his beames of light into our miſtie
minds, that all filthie fogs of affections
diſperſed and driuen awaie;
vncharitablenes likewiſe, with the
reſt, may be diſplaced, throwne out
of poſſeſſion, and troden vnder feet:
conſidering that ſo long as we giue
ſo graceles a geſt houſe-roome in
our harts, we can not be touched
with compaſſion of the poore: being
void of compaſſion, wee contemne
the poore: contemning them
we ſtop our eares at their crie: ſtopping
our eares, we ſhut the bowels
of pitie againſt them: ſhutting the
bowels of pitie, what doo wee but
murther them moſt miſerablie?
                     The end and reward of which
merciles intreating of the diſtreſſed,
being ouergrowne with vncharitablenes,
is, when we make our
mone vnto thee, ô Lord, not to be
heard: and when we ſeeke ſuccour,

to be ſent awaie emptie: ô giue vs
grace to waxe fearfull at the example
of the vncharitable rich man,
whoſe want of pitie purchaſed vnto
him ſtore of endles torments: heare
vs for Chriſts ſake, and from all vncharitableneſſe
defend vs and our
children, to the third and fourth
generation, Amen.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     1 S. BARNARDS golden
ſentence of the vertue
following.
                     
                        MERCIE is an affection, which is
neither reſtrained by will, nor ſubdued
to reaſon; bicauſe euerie bodie
dooth not drawe it to himſelfe voluntarilie
at his owne pleaſure: but mercie
mooueth godlie minds with a neceſſarie
affection to haue compaſſion of the ſad, ſorowfull,
grieued, and distreſſed perſon; in
ſo much that although it were a ſinne to
be mercifull; doo as much as I might, and
what my will forceth me vnto, yet I can
not chooſe but be mercifull.
                     Reaſon and will may indeed pull backe

ſomewhat from this affection, they may
hinder it a little, but are they able to root
it out of the hart, to ſupplant it, to quench
it? Iustice requireth deſert, but mercie
beholdeth miſerie. True mercie iudgeth
not, but taketh pitie; it ſtandeth not
vpon examining, but is content with the
preſent occaſion. For reaſon is not looked
for, where affection draweth. For the mind,
which loue hath once rauiſhed, and compaſſion
pricked, is not ſuffered to haue
rule ouer it ſelfe. It feareth things which
it knoweth not, greeueth at things which
behoue not, is more carefull than it would
be, and for cauſes that it ſhould not be:
vnwilling it ſuffereth, vnwilling it pitieth.
                     Some are mercifull in reſpect of things
not belonging vnto them; and theſe are
offended, bicauſe men giue not abundantlie
to all; howbeit in ſuch ſort, that they
themſelues in that modicum or little of
theirs are not touched with remorſe; who
if they were mercifull, then ought they to
ſhew mercie by giuing their owne; and if
they be not able of their worldlie mucke,
yet ſhould they with a good will pardon

ſuch as haue offended them, they ſhould
giue ſweet dole, euen a good word, which is
the best gift that can be giuen, that their
minds may be mooued to repentance. To
conclude, they ſhould not onlie haue pitie,
but alſo praie for all ſuch as they knowe
are in ſinne; otherwiſe, their mercie is no
mercie, and therefore they ſhall not obtaine
mercie.
                  
                  
                     2 The REPVLSE giuen by
COMPASSION and
MERCIE.
                     
                        
                           O
                         Man, if thou kéepe
that meaſure in this
reſpect of giuing,
which the Apoſtle
dooth preſcribe, thou
maieſt both beſtowe vpon the impotent,
and alſo haue ſufficient for
the maintenance of thy familie.
And therefore to this purpoſe the
Apoſtle vſeth a pithie ſpéech, verie
apt and conuenient, ſaieng: If
there be a willing mind, it is accepted
according to that which a
man hath; &amp; not according to that

which he hath not.
                     Not that other be ſet at eaſe, and
you burthened: but of like condition
now at this time, your abundance
ſupplieth their want, that
their abundance alſo may ſupplie
your want, that there may be an
equalitie, as it is written: He that
had gathered much, had nothing ouer:
and he that had gathered little,
had no lacke.
                     Herevpon a certaine righteous
father admoniſheth his vertuous
ſonne in this ſort: If thou haſt
much, giue plentifullie; but if thou
haſt little, giue alſo of that little
willinglie. To the ſame effect alſo
the word incarnate (Ieſus Chriſt
I meane) ſaith thus: But rather
giue almes of thoſe things which
you haue, and behold, all things
are cleane vnto you. Liſten furthermore,
O man, what the ſcripture
ſaith: He ſhall haue iudgment
without mercie, which ſheweth no
mercie.
                     To the contrarie whereof, the

prophet vſeth theſe words, Breake
thy bread to the hungrie, and bring
the poore and harbourles into thy
houſe. When thou ſéeſt one naked,
couer him, and deſpiſe not thine
owne fleſh. Remember what heauie
doome happened to the rich
man in purple and ſilke, who was
not condemned bicauſe hée tooke
from other men their owne goods:
but for that hée gaue not of his
plentie &amp; abundance to the néedie.
                     Was he not tormented in hell,
and forced there to make euen verie
ſmall requeſts, and yet could not
obtaine them; bicauſe whiles he liued
in this life, he denied trifles to
the ſuccouries? He denied the little
crums falling from his table, and
therefore it was not granted vnto
him to haue the tip of his tongue
cooled with cold water. He would
not ſend his ſeruants with a little
refreſhing to the poore beggar; and
therefore he could not get ſo much
grace, as to let his brethren vnderſtand
his torments for their inſtruction

and amendement.
                     But marke, O man, the ſeuere
ſentence of the iuſt Iudge, denounced
and thundered out in wrath
and vengeance againſt the wicked
goats on his left hand: Go ye curſed
into euerlaſting fire, prepared
for the diuell and his angels. For
I was hungrie, and you gaue mée
no meate: and ſo foorth, as followeth
in that place verie iuſtlie and
terriblie.
                  
                  
                     3 A praier for the former
vertue.
                     O Eternall and gratious GOD,
who by ſeuere reuengement
executed vpon the vnmerciful, haſt
commended vnto vs the contrarie
vertue; we moſt humblie beſeech
thee, that the diuine admonition of
thy ſonne, that pitifull Samaritane,
who caſt his eies of compaſſion vpon
the wounded traueller, lieng in
the high waie betweene Ieruſalem
and Iericho, after that a prieſt and

a Leuite had paſſed by, and miniſtred
vnto him not ſo much as one
little mite of comfort, giuen vnto
vs in the Goſpell, may worke effectuallie
in our harts, namelie, to be
mercifull, as thou our heauenlie
Father art mercifull.
                     And bicauſe the ſacred Scripture
teacheth vs: that With what meaſure
we meate vnto others, the like
they ſhall meate vnto vs againe:
vouchſafe that we learning and folowing
the ſage and ſound counſell
of Salomon, may diſtribute our
temporall riches liberallie with open
hand; knowing that we ſhall
be recompenſed with plentie: and
may water abundantlie, beleeuing
that we ſhalbe rewarded with ſtore
of ſeaſonable raine: that is, for mercie,
to receiue mercie, which thou
requireſt rather than ſacrifice.
                     Let the examples of thy ſeruants,
and that principallie of Dauid, a
man according to thine owne harts
deſire, direct vs to the full diſcharge
of our dutie; who although he had

opportunitie to kill Saule, and was
thereto incited by the aduiſe of his
warriers, had compaſſion of him
notwithſtanding, refuſing to laie
his hand vpon the Lords annointed.
Euen ſo, good &amp; gratious God,
grant vs to deale with our enimies,
that although they perſecute vs
moſt tyrannicallie, and moſt villanouſlie
intreate vs; yet we may put
vp all iniuries patientlie, praieng
for their amendment, and referring
vengeance vnto thee, whoſe it is by
proper challenge.
                     Finallie, moſt bountifull Father,
what gift ſoeuer thou haſt beſtowed
vpon vs, be it either wiſdome, counſell,
vtterance, knowledge of tongs,
or other ornament of mind whatſoeuer,
which anie of our brethren
wanting, may by the imparting and
vſing thereof reape ſome profit;
vouchſafe vs, that we may be ſo far
from denieng them our helpe and
ſuccour; that we may be well content
to let all that we poſſeſſe bee
conuerted and turned into their

benefit: ſo far foorth, as ſafetie of
conſcience will ſuffer, and thy glorie
allow. This grant, ô good God,
for Ieſus ſake, our onelie mediator
and aduocate, Amen.

ſentence of the vice
inſuing.
                     
                        CRaftie and deceitfull dealing, commonlie
called couſenage, is to be abhorred
for three notable reaſons: first, bicauſe
it offendeth Gods Maiestie heinouſlie,
in ſo much that Salomon ſaith, It is
an abhomination to the Lord, Secondlie,
bicauſe it defraudeth and beguileth a
mans neighbour with a ſhew of honest
meaning; against which default Dauid
complaineth, ſaieng: Their throte is an
open graue, they deceiue with their tongs,
the poiſon of aſpes is vnder their lips:
againe, They haue made their words ſofter
than oile, but indeed they are ſharpe arrowes.
Thirdlie, bicauſe the deceiuer is

destroied with his owne deceit: according
to theſe words: Lo, he hath trauelled
in ſinne, and brought foorth iniquitie; he
hath digged a pit, and fallen into it himſelfe:
againe, Curſed be the deceitfull.
                     As for theft, we ought to flie from it, as
from a ſcorpion, and that for three ſpeciall
reaſons: first, bicauſe God forbiddeth
vs, ſaieng; Thou ſhalt not ſteale. Secondlie,
bicauſe of the danger depending thervpon,
taught vs in theſe words: He that
taketh part with a theefe, hateth his owne
ſoule. Thirdlie, bicauſe of the puniſhment
belonging therevnto; namelie, three-fold
and foure-fold restitution, according to
the lawe Leuiticall: and loſſe of life by the
ſentence of the poſitiue lawes of ſundrie
countries, beſides the plague of al plagues
in the world to come, fore-told by the
mouth of the Apostle, that Theeues ſhall
haue no portion in the kingdome of
God. Where then? Euen in
hell fire, the kingdome of
the blacke prince
of darknes.

and theft.
                     
                        
                           O
                         Man, obſerue the
courſe of the time,
and conſider, that as
euerie one is bent to
ſéeke for his owne
aduantage; ſo is it for thée likewiſe
to vſe the ſame libertie. Art thou
called to be ſome noble, ſome worſhipfull,
ſome rich mans ſteward,
ſecretarie, chamberline, bailie, or
ſurueier? vſe thy place in ſuch ſort,
as thou maiſt gaine extraordinarilie
beſides thy wageſ.
                     Art thou in office in citie or
countrie? Diſſemble the faultes of
them that are wealthie for rewards:
and be not too ſeuere in
the execution of lawes and penall
ſtatutes. For it is commonlie
ſéene, that the beſt Iuſticiarie is
not beſt beloued: but he that can
winke at the offences of ſuch as
are of countenance, hée carrieth

awaie credit and eſtimation.
                     Art thou an artificer, an occupier,
a merchant, or of anie kind of
trade? I counſell thée then to make
thy wares, though they be ſtarke
naught, ſéeme exceeding pure and
good: be it ſilke, veluet, cloth, or
anie other vtenſile, cauſe and procure
them to be ſlightiie wrought,
that although the price of them be
verie hie, yet they may ſoone fret
out, weare awaie, and doo little
ſeruice.
                     Art thou a maiſter, and haſt a
retinue of ſeruants to maintaine
thine occupieng? Vſe their ſtocks
to thy benefit, and defraud them of
ſome part or parcell thereof, vpon
ſome craftie deuiſe of charging
them with vntruth &amp; diſhoneſtie in
their ſeruice. A thouſand ſubtilties
there be, O man, which thou
maieſt vſe with ſafetie of conſcience,
to the inriching of thy ſelfe, if
thou wilt marke the trade of the
world.
                     Furthermore, art thou a tall felowe

of thy hands, a keeper of companie,
and haſt béene brought vp
all thy life time, in dooing nothing
towards the getting of thy liuing?
I will teach thée how to ſhift, and
maintaine thy ſelfe like a Gentleman.
Séeke acquaintance of ſuch
as vſe the ſea, and learne to be ſkilfull
in nauigation: when thou art
become expert therein, put this into
the heads of thy confederates, to
practiſe piracie: for that is a thing
which manie haue venturouſlie
taken in hand, and in ſhort ſpace
growne maruellous rich.
                     It that faile thée, and can not be
ſo conuenientlie compaſſed, thou
ſhalt find enow to take thy part
on land, with whom thou maieſt
ioine in ſocietie, &amp; get manie a good
bootie. Doo this, and I warrant
thée lacke no liuing.
                  
                  
                     3 A praier againſt the
former vice.
                     O Almightie God, forſomuch as
it is thy heauenlie will and diuine

pleaſure, that we ſhould like
louing and obedient children, like
relenting and buxſome creatures,
imitate and followe thee in holines
and purenes of life (which we are
ſure then moſt ſpeciallie to doo,
when with our vttermoſt indeuour,
we applie our ſelues in thought,
word and deed, to obſerue thy commandements)
purge our affections,
we praie thee, and trie them ſeuentie
ſeuen times by the purifieng fire
of thy ſanctifieng ſpirit.
                     We knowe this for a truth, that
except we reſemble thee in qualitie,
according to thy ſonne our Sauiours
admonition, exhorting vs to
be perfect and holie, as thou our father
art perfect &amp; holie; there is no
hope that we ſhall attaine to that
incorruptible fruit of our heauenlie
calling. And therefore, good
Lord, let thy grace burne brightlie
before vs, like a lampe repleniſhed
with freſh oile; that we ſeeing our
waie, may ſo order our ſteps in this
troubleſome trauell of ours in this

wicked world, as thou thereby maiſt
be magnified.
                     The verie inſtinct of nature teacheth
vs, ô Lord, beſides thy commandement,
which bindeth vs, that
we ſhould doo to our brethren, as
we would they ſhould doo vnto vs:
that no man ſhould abuſe the grace
of his calling, by craftie circumuention
to procure his priuate profit,
or by anie ſiniſter and indirect dealing,
to the detriment and hinderance
of another, (a fault too too
common in this our age) but that
contrariwiſe, we ſhould beare one
anothers burden in charitie, and
Chriſtian brotherhood.
                     Which lawe of nature neuertheles,
being neglected; and thy precept,
tending to the ſame effect, not
regarded: we beſeech thee notwithſtanding,
to winke awhile at the
follie of men, to beare with their
infirmities, and to mealt their froſen
harts with the thawing heate of
thy feruent ſpirit; that being aſhamed
of abuſing their vocation, and

                     1 S. BARNARDS golden
ſentence of the vertue
following.
                     
                        WILT thou learne, ô man, how to
vſe true and plaine dealing? I
will tell thee what thou must doo. First
ſee to thine inward eie, that it be ſingle indeed,
whereto I thinke two things verie
neceſſarie; namelie, charitie in the intent,
and truth in making thy choiſe. For
if thou loue that which is good, and chooſe
not that which is true, thou hast a zeale
of God, but not according to knowledge:
and I wot not how in the iudgement of
truth, plaine dealing, and double dealing
may ſtand togither.
                     Christ the truth it ſelfe, being diſpoſed
to traine his diſciples to true plaine
dealing, willeth them to be wiſe like ſerpents,
and harmeles as dooues. He ſetteth
wiſedome before plaine dealing, without

the which he knew well inough none could
be a true plaine dealer. How then ſhall
the eie be ſingle indeed, with the ignorance
of truth? It is euident therefore,
that this praiſe-woorthie plaine dealing,
commended of Chriſt, is not without theſe
two good properties: namelie, well willing,
and wiſedome; that the eie (to wit) of the
hart, might not onlie be godlie, and ſo vtterlie
vnwilling to deceiue; but alſo warie,
as not able to be deceiued.
                     Furthermore, as theſe two properties
make the eie ſingle; namelie, the loue of
that which is good, and the knowledge of
that which is true: euen ſo theſe two contraries
make the eie euill, to wit, blindnes,
or ignorance, which hindereth the knowledge
of the truth: and frowardnes or
wilfulnes, which cauſeth a man to loue
iniquitie and wickednes.
                  
                  
                     2 The REPVLSE giuen by VPRIGHTNES,
and plaine
dealing.
                     
                        
                           O
                         Man, it is much better to
be poore, and not able to
giue anie thing at all, than

to indamage or hurt thy freend, thy
neighbour, or thy brother by robberie
or ſubtiltie. For he which vniuſtlie
taketh awaie another mans
goods, and liueth vpon the ſpoile,
he ſhutteth the gates of the kingdome
of heauen againſt himſelfe.
                     Héerevpon, that profound Preacher
of the Gentiles reprooueth
certaine of the Corinthians his
hearers, ſaieng: There is vtterlie
a fault among you, becauſe you go
to lawe one with another. Why rather
do ye not put vp wrong? Why
rather doo yée not ſuffer harme?
Nay, yée your ſelues doo wrong,
and doo harme, and that to your
bréethren. Knowe ye not that the
vnrighteous ſhall not inherit the
kingdome of God?
                     The ſame Apoſtle reckoning vp
a rabble of filthie ſinners, that are
excluded from comming to Gods
kingdom, addeth theſe in the number,
ſaieng: Neither théeus nor extortioners
ſhall poſſeſſe the kingdome
of heauen. Againe, in another

place, by waie of exhortation, he
teacheth thée a leſſon, O man,
which if thou wilt learne, it ſhall
doo thée great good, namelie: that
whatſoeuer things are true, whatſoeuer
things are honeſt, whatſoeuer
things are iuſt, whatſoeuer
things are pure, whatſoeuer
things pertaine to loue, whatſoeuer
things are of honeſt report,
thoſe things doo; and the God of
peace ſhall be with thée.
                     This God of peace preciſelie forbiddeth
theft, ſaieng: Thou ſhalt
not ſteale. And Chriſt Ieſus the
ſauiour of thy ſoule ſpeaketh thus
vnto thée: Loue thy neighbour as
thy ſelfe. To the ſame effect the Apoſtle
giueth thée counſell to put
off the old man with his works; in
the number wherof, euill concupiſcence
&amp; couetouſnes are reckoned.
                     The laſt precept giuen in that
place, is to doo that hartilie which
we doo, as vnto God, not to men;
wherevpon he inferreth this ſentence:
He that doeth wrong, ſhall

receiue for the wrong which he
hath done. The ſame Apoſtle giueth
this wholeſome aduiſe to the
Coloſſians: To doo their owne buſines,
and to worke with their
own hands, that they might walke
honeſtlie, and lacke nothing.
                     To conclude, if thou art commanded,
O man, to abſteine euen
from the verie appearance of euill;
iudge with thy ſelfe, and examine
thine owne conſcience, whether it
be lawfull for thée, either craftilie
to circumuent, or violentlie to
ſpoile thy Chriſtian brother. Remember
the laſt commandement:
Thou ſhalt not couet that which
is anothers, then learne to be contented
with thine owne.
                  
                  
                     3 A praier for the former
vertue.
                     O Ieſus Chriſt, the liuelie and
expreſſe image of the Father;
forſomuch as it is a leſſon taught
vs in thy Goſpell, that we ſhould be

ſimple as dooues, louing as lambs,
and innocent as little children, otherwiſe
we can not enter into the
kingdome of heauen: we beſeech
thee by thy bitter death and paſſion,
to root out of our cankered and
corrupt minds, all maner of euill
concupiſcences, which like ranke
weedes ouergrowe and choake all
kind of good and godlie affections
in vs; ſo that we can not thinke,
much leſſe doo that, which is acceptable
to thy diuine pleaſure.
                     May it pleaſe thee therefore, ô
Lambe of God, that takeſt awaie
the ſinnes of the world, for thy
bloudie wounds ſake, wherein my
faults, and the offences of all mankind
were buried, to plant in vs, and
in euerie one of vs, a childiſh and
infant-like innocencie, whereby we
may vtterlie forget the falſehoods
&amp; ſubtilties of wicked worldlings,
wherein they are ſo deeplie grounded,
that they make no conſcience
of anie profered iniurie, of anie violent
extortion, of anie diueliſh oppreſſion,

be it neuer ſo contrarie to
lawe and equitie, be it neuer ſo flat
againſt Gods holie commandement,
and Chriſtian profeſſion.
                     Let the world be like it ſelfe, &amp;
let worldlings wallowe in their
woonted filthines: let the ſworne
enimies of true and faithfull dealing,
ſurfet of ſinne; and like dogs
deuoure their owne vomit: but to
vs thy children adopted, or rather
brothers and ſiſters aſſured, giue
ſuch portion of thy ſpirit, that as
the members and lims of our bodies,
by a naturall inclination to
loue and kindnes, prouide each
one for anothers health and welfare:
ſo we may ſeeke, not euerie
man his owne; but that which is anothers,
to the knitting faſt of the
knot of vnitie and concord, that in
this life our ioie may be continued
in hope, &amp; performed in the life to
come, with all fulnes and certaintie,
by the merits of
thy death and paſſion,
Amen.

ſentence of the vice
inſuing.
                     
                        LIENG is a horrible ſin before God,
and hatefull among men, which we
ought to defie to the death for theſe ſixe
ſpeciall reaſons. 1 Becauſe God forbiddeth
vs to lie, ſaieng: Yee ſhall not lie,
nor one neighbour deceiue another. 2 Bicauſe
it is a ſeed of the diuels ſowing, according
to thoſe words of Christ ſpoken to
the Phariſies: You are of your father the
diuell, when he telleth a lie, he ſpeaketh of
his owne, becauſe he is a lier, and the father
thereof. 3 Becauſe good men deteſt
and abhor it, as Salomon ſaith; A iust
man cannot awaie with a lie. 4 Becauſe
wicked men vſe it, as is ſaid: An euill
man hath a falſe tongue, and a deceiuer
is led with lieng lips: againe, The bread
of lieng is ſweete to a wicked man. 5 Becauſe
it deceiueth our neighbour, as it is
ſaid, Lieng lips hide hatred, and a falſe

witnes telleth a lie, yea euen against his
neighbour. 6 Becauſe it confoundeth the
lier himſelfe in the end, as it is ſaid; Deſtruction
ſhall light vpon all them that
ſpeake lies: againe, A lieng tongue killeth
the ſoule. As for diſſembling, the
ſcripture crieth out vpon it, denouncing a
bitter wo against ſuch as haue a double
heart.
                  
                  
                     2 The ASSALT giuen by LIENG
and DISSEMBLING.
                     
                        
                           O
                         Man, to ſpeak truth,
is verie diſcommodious
and vnprofitable;
and to deale plainelie
in word and déed, yeldeth
little aduantage. I wiſh thée
therefore to eſchew both, if thou
meaneſt to auoid contempt and reproch
in the world. For who is regarded
in theſe daies? The honeſt
man? The iuſt man? The godlie
man? The innocent man? No,
but the contrarie. And therefore,
wilt thou haue wealth at will?

Then learne to lie, to cog, to foiſt,
to c
                           •
                        oſen and counterfet. For there
is more good gotten by a lie in a
daie, than by telling the truth in a
yeare. Againe, by lieng manie a one
hath ſaued his own life, and by diſſembling,
diuers haue eſcaped
death. Wilt thou then neglect two
ſuch commodious and beneficiall
things?
                     If time and place require, ſtick
not, though thou be rich, to ſweare
thou art poore: though wiſe, to faine
thy ſelfe a foole. For it may come
to paſſe, that by ſo counterfetting
and facing, thou ſhalt ſaue ſuch
charges, as otherwiſe thou art
likelie, by profeſſing thy ſelfe either
wealthie or prudent, to vndertake.
                     And though Preachers out of
pulpits prate againſt this, and as
manie as vſe it; yet eſtéeme their
words but wind, and count all they
ſay, but table-talke. For euen they
themſelues, as holie as they ſéeme
to be, will not ſticke to diſſemble,
lie, and doo worſſe for aduantage.
                     
                        
Now, becauſe there is cunning
in diſſembling and lieng, which
muſt be gotten by vſe and exerciſe,
I counſell thée to make this thy
continuall trade and cuſtome; ſo
ſhalt thou proue maruellous expert
in thine art, and therewithall
ſo perfect and redie, that none ſhall
be able either to preuent and ouertake,
or intercept and trip thée in
thy profeſſion.
                  
                  
                     3 A praier againſt the
former vice.
                     O Almightie and eternall God,
forſomuch as the lawe, which
is our ſcholemaiſter vnto Chriſt,
hath taught vs this leſſon, that he is
accurſed, and in ſtate of damnation,
that tranſgreſſeth the two tables of
the ten commandements: and the
ſame is ratified alſo by the teſtimonie
of the Goſpell, which holdeth
him giltie of the breach of euerie
precept, who offendeth but in one:
we, euen we damned and forſaken
ſoules, through the aſſault of ſin;

but heires of the promiſe, by the
croſſe of Chriſt; moſt humblie we
beſeech thee to tender vs poore
weakelings, and to beare with our
imperfections.
                     We knowe that lieng diſpleaſeth
thee, becauſe thou art truth it ſelfe:
wee confeſſe that diſſembling is a
vice deteſted of thy diuine maieſtie,
which art perfect righteouſnes: in
reſpect wherof, and for that we haue
offended in both, vnderſtanding neuertheleſſe,
that thou requireſt the
contrarie; namelie, ſinglenes of hart
and vprightnes in communication
and conuerſation: we fall downe at
the footeſtoole of thy tribunall
throne of grace, repenting vs of
this and all other defaults, wherby
we are in iuſtice become the
children of Sathan, who is the father
of lies, and hath bene a lier and
diſſembler from the beginning.
                     Moſt earneſtlie ſuing vnto thee,
ô mercifull father, to remit that
which is paſt, to croſſe it out of thy
counting booke, and to diſcharge vs

of ſo great a debt; that all former
reckonings being cleered, we may
looke better to our talents, and like
faithfull and wiſe ſtewards, bring in
not onlie the gift it ſelfe wherewith
we were put in truſt, but alſo the intereſt
of the ſame, at that great audit
and generall ſeſſion, when all
fleſh ſhall be ſummoned to appeare
before thee, the Iudge of
iudges. Grant this for Chriſtes ſake
thy ſon our ſauiour, Amen.

ſentence of the vertue
following.
                     
                        TRVTH in the inward parts, is the
thing that God requireth. Truth
and equitie are the things which he loueth.
The diuell was a manqueller from
the beginning: and why? bicauſe the truth
was not in him. Truth is the fruit of light,
as for lieng, it is a worke of darkneſſe.
Truth is to be honoured, becauſe it ouercommeth
all things; truth is to be imbraced,
becauſe it defendeth from ſhame;

truth is to be aduanced, becauſe it endureth
for euer; truth is to be regarded, becauſe
it is blameles; truth is to be obeied,
becauſe it preuaileth.
                     As for equitie, let this ſuffice thee ô man
in few words, that the greateſt equitie that
can be, is to behaue thy ſelfe lowlie to
thine vnderling, reuerentlie to thy better,
and louinglie to thine equall; to deale vprightlie,
to depart from euill, and do good.
For the equitie and iustice of a plaine-dealing
man, ſhall direct his waies: and if
thine eie be ſingle, all thy bodie ſhall be
full of light; as for a double minded man,
he is wauering in all his waies.
                  
                  
                     2 The REPVLSE giuen by
TRVTH and EQVITIE.
                     
                        
                           O
                         Man, be not deceiued,
God is not mocked,
neither can he be
deluded. In ſéeking
to deceiue him, thou
deceiueſt thy ſelfe. For the mouth
of him, whoſoeuer he be, that ſpeaketh
lies, be it with neuer ſuch

cunning &amp; ſl
                           •
                        nes, ſlaieth the iouie;
and all liers ſhall haue their portion
in the lake that burneth with
fire and brimſtone.
                     Doeſt thou not remember, O
man, the words of the Prophet
Dauid, compriſed in an anſwere
to a demand of his making? Lord,
ſaith he, who ſhall dwell in thy tabernacle,
or who ſhall inhabit in thy
holie hill? The reſolution followeth,
wherein, among other there
mentioned, he that hath vſed no deceipt
in his tongue, nor done euill
to his neighbour, is rehearſed to
haue his portion.
                     To this purpoſe ſerueth the ſaieng
of the ſonne of Sirach, A lie is
a wicked ſhame in a man, yet ſhall
it be euer in the mouth of the vnwiſe.
A théefe is better than a man
that is accuſtomed to lie, but they
both ſhall haue deſtruction to heritage.
The conditions of liers are
vnhoneſt, and their ſhame is euer
with them. By which words, O
man, thou maiſt, if thou haſt anie

grace in thee, perceiue what an odious
and accurſed ſin lieng and diſſembling
is, and what danger they
run into that vſe them.
                     And therefore be warned to auoid
ſuch a rock, as maketh ſhipwracke
of the ſaluation of thy ſoule: and
though thou be aſſalted with the
ſwéetnes of the ſame, yet take héed
how thou putteſt thy ſelfe in aduenture
to becom acquainted therwithall.
To terrifie thée the more
from accuſtoming thy tongue to
ſuch a peſtilent vice, ſet before thine
eies the example of Ananias and
Saphira his wife, both poſſeſſed
with the ſpirit of lieng and diſſembling
to the holie Ghoſt, and therefore
rewarded with ſudden death.
                     O horrible iudgement of the higheſt
God! whereby, O man, thou
maiſt be inſtructed, if thou wilt,
that God is the author of truth
and righteouſnes, the louer of equitie
and innocencie, and a deteſter of
double dealing and hypocriſie.
                     To conclude this matter, O

man, followe the counſell of the Apoſtle
giuen to the Coloſſians his
hearers: To put off the works of
darkens, and to walke in light: to
leaue lieng one to another, and to
ſpeake the truth euerie man to his
neighbour.
                  
                  
                     3 A praier for the former
vertue.
                     O God the Father of heauen, the
beholder of all things, viſible
and inuiſible; which ſeeſt our inward
and cloked thoughts, be they
neuer ſo ſecret &amp; darke: yea, which
ſeeſt the iſſue of thē before they are
conceiued; much more our actions
or deeds, wherein is greater manifeſtation
and appearance: we beſeech
thee firſt of all, to bind our
manifold and innumerable ſinnes
in a bundell, and caſting them behind
thy backe, to drowne in
the bottome of the ſea, that they
may ſinke, and neuer come againe
in ſight.
                     
                        
Secondlie, we craue at thy bountifull
hands the ſpirit of vnderſtanding
and knowledge, which may
lead vs as it were by torch-light, or
rather ſunne-ſhine, to the waie of
truth and equitie; which ought to
be the bounds and limits of a Chriſtian
life. For we confeſſe, as we can
not otherwiſe chooſe in reaſon and
conſcience; that we haue not girded
our loines about with veritie, that
we haue not ſpoken plaine truth
one to another, nor vſed interchange
of vpright dealing in the
neceſſarie affaires incident to our
particular vocations, as we are exhorted
by thine holie Apoſtle S.
Paule.
                     And therefore, being ſorie that
wee haue ſhewed our ſelues ſuch
paſt-graces, partlie through carnall
weaknes, partlie alſo through want
of ſpirituall ſtrength; but cheeflie
through the ſubtiltie of Satan, who
inceſſantlie pitcheth his tents of
trecherie about the caſtle of our
ſoules; we come home againe with

wet and waterie cheekes, with our
boſoms full of teares, with our harts
rent and torne with the hookes of
heauines, with wearie knees, wearie
yea and wearie againe with wandering
in wicked waies, bowing them
before thy mercie-ſeate, and beſeeching
thee to be good Father vnto
vs vngratious &amp; froward children.
                     Hitherto indeed, yea hitherto in
verie deed we haue neglected the
rule of obedience, and charitie; the
one towards thee, ô Father; the other
towards our neighbours. And
though we knowe that we ought to
ſerue thee in truth, to maintaine
nothing contrarie to truth, to doo
nothing againſt truth; but all
for and in the behalfe of truth: yet
how far we haue gone beyond theſe
bounds, thine is the iudgement, ô
Father; thine is the vnderſtanding.
As for vs, we are vtterlie ignorant
and ſenſeles; and therefore ſubmit
our ſelues to thy mercifull cenſure,
crauing gentle correction, though
we haue deſerued ſharpe chaſtiſement,

if it be thy pleaſure to puniſh;
or ſuing for remiſſion and forgiuenes,
though vtterlie vnwoorthie of
ſuch grace and fauour, if it be thy
good will to grant vs pardon.
                     Finallie, wee humblie beſeech
thee, to increaſe truth and equitie
in vs, that being led and conducted
thereby, on the right hand and the
left, we may neuer ſtart aſide like a
broken bowe; but keepe on in a
right courſe, till we come to the
kingdome of heauen: which grant,
ô Father, for his ſake, whom thou
loueſt beſt, Ieſus the Sauiour of
ſoules, Amen.

the pleaſure of the fleſh. The aire, the
land, the ſea, do ſcarſelie ſuffice gluttonie.
For gluttonies ſake it commeth to paſſe,
that poore people are ſpoiled, that robberies

are committed, that extortions are
practiſed, that the hunger of the needie is
turned into the fulnes of the wealthie.
                     O ye ſonnes of men, how long will you be
heauie-hearted, by reaſon of this your
groſſe and quarrie bodies? Why do you
loue vanitie ſo much, and care for truth
ſo little? The fatnes of the fleſh, the deintines
of the bodie, the pampering of the
bellie, the cramming of the craw; all theſe
ſhall leaue you before death, or elſe you
ſhall leaue them in death. Heere thy fleſh
is appointed to be meate for woormes,
there thy ſoule is ordeined to be food for
fire; and thou ſhalt be partaker of their
torments, with whoſe foule vices thou haſt
bene acquainted. O deintie mouthed
man! O delicate fellow! which beeing
hemmed in round about with fine fare,
ſuperfluous cheere, and abundance of
wealth, feareſt not confuſion and death.
The kingdome of God is not meate and
drinke, it is not purple and fine ſilke. For
the rich man, hauing plentie and ſtore of
both, went downe to hell in a pricke of
time, in a minute. What ſaie you to this
you gluttons, and exceſſiue worldlings,

whoſe bellie is your God, and whoſe whole
pleaſure and trade is either for the bellie,
or that vnder the bellie, which haue
franked and fattened your harts and bodies
in ſuperfluitie and leacherie. Harke
harke; Meate for the bellie, and the bellie
for meate, but God ſhall destroie the one
and the other.
                     Pride is the cup of diuels, and ſo is ſlander,
and ſo is enuie, and ſo is ſurfeting, and
ſo is dronkennes; which when they haue
ſtuffed the mind &amp; the mawe, Chriſt findeth
no roome to rest in. For as fire and
water cannot agree togither in one place;
euen ſo ſpirituall and carnall deinties can
not abide to dwell togither in one and the
ſame bodie. Where Christ perceiueth the
bodie to belch with ſurfetting and dronkennes,
in the midſt of full foming quaffing
cups, and diſh vpon diſh; he dooth not
vouchſafe to reach out his wine, far ſweeter
than honie, or the honie combe, to
the ſotted mind. And where curious
choice of meates feed the bodie,
the ſoule is kept fasting, and
ſtarueth for want of heauenlie
bread.

and GLVTTONIE.
                     
                        
                           O
                         Man, the creatures
of God are manifold,
and why are they
made, but to be vſed?
The ſcripture ſaith,
that he made all things cleane, and
how can it then be, that thou by
participating them, ſhouldeſt be
vncleane? Furthermore, I would
not haue thée ſo blind and blockiſh,
as to thinke, that thou oughteſt
not to take the benefit of Gods
prouiſion, euen to thy ſatietie and
fulnes.
                     For this is a certaine truth, that
whoſoeuer refuſeth to repleniſh
himſelfe with the varietie &amp; choice
of Gods creatures, when they are
ſet before him; and is deintie and
delicate, coie and ſquemiſh in féeding,
doth what he can to abuſe and
take in ſcorne the gifts granted
and beſtowed. To what end ſerue

the differences of fleſh, of fiſh, of
fowles, of fruits, of wines, and
ſuch like; but to be enioied of thée,
O man, in ſuch plentie, abundance,
&amp; ſuperfluitie, as becommeth thine
eſtate, which art placed in the rule,
dominion, and Lordſhip of all
Gods handie works?
                     If therefore thou neglect to vſe
them, when they are offered ſo liberallie
and largelie; if thou applie
and beſtowe them not in ſuch ſort
as thou maiſt féele thy ſelfe ſingularlie
comforted with them: I ſaie
vnto thée, thou art vnworthie to
receiue ſo great benefitſ. Thy taſt
is a naturall inſtrument, whoſe office
is, to take triall of that which
is delicious and toothſome.
                     Be carefull &amp; curious, moderate
&amp; nice to touch, to taſte, and what
doeſt thou elſe, but defraud thine
owne ſelfe of thy due refection?
Which to vſe to thy full contentment,
were a leſſe offence, than
to ſéeme abſtinent and ſparing in
thy diet. Eate, O man, till thou be

full, drinke till thou begin to loath,
doo both till thou ſurfet; tut, when
this world is done, farewell felicitie:
kéepe good chéere, and plaie the
merrie companion to daie, for to
morrowe thou ſhalt die.
                  
                  
                     3 A praier againſt the
former vice.
                     O Eternall and mercifull father,
we inueigh againſt our ſelues,
and the foule iniquities wherein we
are fallen, through the abſence of
thy grace. We exclaime bitterlie againſt
the diſordered courſe of life,
which we haue continued, euer
ſince we haue had libertie in following
our owne beaſtlie luſts, and
vnbrideled affections; which being
drawne as it were with cartropes,
or rather ſmall twiſted threds (ſo
eaſilie are we allured to commit ſin
euen with greedines) into the ſinke
of manie notorious enormities, and
lothſome miſuſages, ſauoureth moſt
ſtronglie of one notable vice aboue

the reſt, wherein we are ſo deepelie
plunged, that our recouerie, without
the helpe of thy grace, is deſperate.
                     And what ouglie, monſtrous, miſſhapen,
&amp; deformed ſin this ſhould
be; thou, euen thou, in whoſe hands
life and death are ſhut vp, as in a
hold, canſt tell; though we ſhould
neuer ſo cunninglie diſſemble, or
neuer ſo cloſelie conceale the ſame.
Howbeit, we confeſſe before thee, ô
Lord, what it is. For our verie ſoules
haue taken part of the poiſon thereof,
by reaſon of the peſtilent infection
of the ſame, ſpreading it ſelfe
through euerie veine, limme, and
ioint, and leauing no member of
our whole bodie vnattainted.
                     O gluttonie, gluttonie, which
transformeſt and changeſt the nature
of reaſonable creatures, into
rauenous beaſts! Wo woorth thee
that euer we gaue thee houſeroome
in our harts. For by foſtering thee,
we are ſwolne with thy venemous
ſting, and puffed vp like bladders

with the heate of thy poiſon. Out
vpon thee, that euer we were acquainted
with thee. For thou haſt
made vs bond-ſlaues to the fleſh,
whoſe ſeruant thou art, &amp; children
of darknes, wherof thou art a work.
                     But remembring our ſelues, and
conſidering the dangerous or rather
damnable ſtate wherin we are
like to fall, we coniure thee in the
name of the great God of Abraham,
Iſaac, and Iacob, charging thee
to depart from vs, whoſe eies it hath
pleaſed the ſame God to open,
whereby we ſee the naſtines of our
corrupt nature, repent vs of our former
life, and craue the continuance
of Gods grace, that forſaking gluttonie,
and all ſin, we may eſcape the
puniſhment due to the ſame, thorough
Chriſt our Lord, Amen.

ſentence of the vertue
following.
                     
                        SVrfetting and drunkennes is an outward
taking of pleaſure exceſſiuelie,

and an inward fostering or maintaining
of curioſitie fooliſhlie: contrariwiſe, temperance
and ſobernes is an outward brideling
of pleaſures meaſurablie, and an
inward keeping vnder of curioſitie prudentlie.
So that a man is well ſaid to liue
ſoberlie, iustlie, and godlie in theſe three
ſeuerall reſpects.
                     Soberlie, concerning himſelfe; when he
keepeth his bodie in temperance, and abuſeth
not the good gifts of God to wantonnes
and wastfulnes, which are to be vſed
reuerentlie, and thankefullie; conſidering
that they are giuen for ſuſtenance ſake,
and not for gluttonie. Iustlie, concerning
his neighbour, with whom he ought to
deale plainlie, vprightlie, and charitablie.
For theſe properties are the first framers
of iustice, and the last finiſhers of
the ſame. Godlie, concerning God, not preſuming
too much of our ſelues, but beleeuing
faithfullie and vnfainedlie in God,
that through him we may out-growe
all the hinderances and ſtumbling
blocks of this wicked
world.
                  
                  
                     
                        2 The REPVLSE giuen by TEMPERANCE
and SOBERNES.
                     
                        
                           O
                         Man, one of the
parts of thy ſpéech
is true, &amp; alſo agréeable
to reaſon. For

                           •
                        o, to the intent that
thou ſhouldeſt not be famiſhed and
hunger-bitten to death, it pleaſed
the Lord God to make all
things fit for foode, pure and cleane.
But on the contrarie againe, that
thou mighteſt not ſhew thy ſelfe
immoderate in eating and drinking,
a paunch pamperer, and a
bellie god, he enioined and laid vpon
thée the commandement of abſtinence.
                     Furthermore, O man, marke for
thy learning, that Sodom, among
the reſt of hir horrible ſins, came to
deſtruction and ruine, through the
fulnes of bread; the Lord Ieſus
giuing witnes héerevnto, when he
ſpake of Ieruſalem, and ſaieng,

This was the iniquitie and ſin of
thy ſiſter Sodom, euen fulnes of
bread. Wherfore it ſhall be good and
neceſſarie for euerie man, to come
and take his meate and other ſuſtenance,
as the ſick patient receiueth
phyſicke: namelie, not for delectation
or pleaſure, but for neceſſitie
ſake. Héerevpon ſaith the truth,
that became fleſh, Ieſus Chriſt I
meane, in the holie Goſpell: Take
héed that your hearts be not heauie
with ſurfetting and dronkennes.
Againe, S. Paule the Apoſtle
ſpeaking againſt the Iewes inſatiable
deuouring and gréedines, vſeth
theſe words; Manie walke, of
whome I haue often told you, and
now tell you wéeping, that they
are the enimies of the croſſe of
Chriſt, whoſe bellie is their God,
and glorie to their ſhame, which
mind earthlie things. Againe,
Meate for the bellie, and the bellie
for meate, but God ſhall deſtroie
both the one and the other.
                     Now will I teach thée, O man,

who he is that falleth not into this
vice of gluttonie; but reſiſting the
ſame, ouercommeth and conquereth
it. Euen he, which in receiuing
his food and nouriſhment, is
not onlie parciall, moderate, and of
a contented mind, whereby he is
able to rule and temper his appetite,
when he féeleth himſelfe aſſalted
with hunger: but he alſo which
deſpiſeth fine fare, delicate diſhes,
plentie, or rather ſuperfluitie of
cates; except it be ſo that his bodie
being weake, féeble, and impotent,
cannot brooke groſſe or ſtrong
meates; or that vpon occaſion of
entertaining his fréends, he muſt
néeds, for the auoiding of the ſuſpicion
of couetouſnes, and miſerable
niggardnes, prepare ſuch
banqueting chéere, as may ſéeme
agréeable to the perſons aſſembled.
                  
                  
                     3 A praier for the former
vertue.
                     O Almightie &amp; immortall God,
thy word teacheth vs, that thou

art carefull euen ouer little ſparrowes,
which haue their food from
thee: how much more mercifull, fauorable
and tender ouer vs, whom
thou haſt made poſſeſſors of all thy
bleſſingſ, powred out in full and ouerruning
meaſure vpon the earth?
In conſideration whereof, aſſiſt vs
with thy good ſpirit, that we may reuerentlie
receiue them, to that end
wherevnto they were giuen vs: not
abuſing them to wantonneſſe and
fleſhlie pleaſure, or to any ſuch heatheniſh
vanitie; knowing, that is to
kindle the fire of thy furie, to conſume
vs vtterlie both bodie and
ſoule: but vſing them rather to the
comfort of our owne bodies, their
reliefe ouer whom we haue charge,
&amp; the ſuſtentation of the poore diſtreſſed
mēbers of thy Church; that
thus doing, we may liue in ſo much
the leſſe blame, in reſpect of thee,
whoſe glorie we are bound in conſcience,
aboue all things to prefer.
                     Which courſe of life, bicauſe it is
vnpoſſible for anie naturall man

to keepe, vnles he receiue extraordinarie
grace from aboue, and haue
ſuch helps as may tedder and tie in
his wandering affections: wee beſeech
thee to haue regard to our
preſent ſtate, and to furniſh vs with
that vertue, which thou knoweſt
moſt neceſſarie in this behalfe;
euen the vertue of temperance,
whereby we may obſerue a decent
order, not onelie in our diet, and
dailie refreſhing: but alſo in our
apparell, and all other exerciſes,
which we take in hand: that thy
name therby may be magnified, and
the inward hope of our holie calling
eſtabliſhed, through the merits
of Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour,
Amen.

                     1 S. BARNARDS golden
ſentence of the vice
inſuing.
                     THREE reaſons there be, which may
restraine thee, ô man, from fooliſh

and exceſſiue reioicing. The first, becauſe
it is vaine, and as Salomon ſaith, ſuch
mirth ſhall be mingled with moorning,
and the end of ſuch ioie ſhall be lamentation,
and therefore it is vaine. Secondlie,
becauſe it is wicked, and therefore the wiſe
man ſaith, It is better to go into a houſe
of moorning, than into a houſe of banketting
and merrie-making. For in the one
thou art put in mind of the end of all
fleſh; and being aliue, bethinkest what is
to come: beſides that, where exceſſiue reioicing
is, there is the hart of fooles, in ſo
much that, euen in laughter, he worketh
wickednes. Thirdlie, bicauſe it is dangerous,
and as the Euangeliſt ſaith, Wo be
to them that laugh now; for they ſhall
weepe and wring their hands, their laughing
ſhall be turned into lamenting, and
their ioie into heauines. Let thy reioicing
therefore haue theſe two properties; first,
that it be honest, which God alloweth,
ſaieng, Go thy waies, and eate thy bread
with gladnes, and drinke thy wine with
ioie, for thy works pleaſe the Lord; ſecondlie,
that it be fruitfull, which God, approoueth
likewiſe by the ſcripture in theſe

words, A merrie and light hart maketh a
glad countenance: againe, There is no
ioie aboue the ioie of the heart.

                           O
                         Man, conſider with
thy ſelfe, that there
is no part or member
of thy bodie, but
ſerueth to ſome end;
the eare to heare, the eie to ſée, the
tongue to taſte, the noſe to ſmell,
the fingers to féele, the throte to
ſwallowe, the ſtomach to digeſt,
the ſecret parts to ingender, the
legs and féet to carrie the bodie
from place to place, and the hart
principallie to perceiue, thinke, vnderſtand,
deuiſe, and meditate vpon
ſundrie matters.
                     The caſe ſtanding thus, it ſhall
be good for thée to let ſorrowe and
gréefe go, remembring that a heauie
hart haſteneth the daie of death,
but a merrie mind prolongeth life.

What cauſe haſt thou, O man, to
be penſiue and ſad; naie, what occaſion
haſt thou not to be excéeding
ioifull and glad? Thou wanteſt no
kind of delight that may be deuiſed,
and therefore it were follie for
thée to ſhew thy ſelfe otherwiſe affected,
than thou art moued by neceſſarie
occaſion.
                     Two things there are, which
kindle the ſenſes, and ſet their dulnes
on edge; namelie, wine and muſick:
accuſtome thy ſelfe vnto them,
and thou ſhalt haue both a merrie
conceiuing head, and alſo a reioicing
heart. Furthermore, if thou
haue in thy braine anie pleaſant
toies, that may moue laughter and
ſport, hide them not; but get thée abroade
among thy companions, and
make them partakers of thy delite.
                     Eſtéeme not that vaine ſaieng of
Salomon, which condemneth a
man giuen to laughter, for a foole.
For I tell thée, that as reaſon and
communication are proper vnto
men, euen ſo to take laughter from

them, is to make them brutiſh, and
of a beaſtlike nature.
                  
                  
                     3 A praier againſt the
former vice.
                     O Almightie God, which knoweſt
that in our reioicing there
is great danger; as in the higheſt
graſſe a venemous ſerpent is ſooneſt
to be feared: our requeſt vnto
thy goodnes is, that it will pleaſe
thee to vouchſafe vs ſuch meaſure
of true and ſincere vnderſtanding,
as thereby we may atteine to that
diſcretion and ripenes of iudgement,
which is able to teach vs the
differences of reioicing, and the
perfect vſe thereof; in ſuch ſort, as
our ſelues may thereby be releeued,
and thy moſt holie name in no
reſpect or condition diſhonored.
                     Aboue all things, moſt mercifull
Father, baniſh as far from vs as the
Eaſt is diſtant from the Weſt, all
counterfet and damnable reioicings
of the world; whoſe greateſt

part and portion is tempered with
the leauen of iniquitie: the baites
whereof, although they be delectable
and toothſome; yet the operation,
working, and effects of the
ſame are deteſtable and irkeſome:
yea, damnation dependeth therevpon,
and no leſſe deſtruction than
betideth a ſillie fiſh, deceiued with
the fiſhers hooke; yea, a far greater
deſolation a thouſand fold.
                     To thee therfore, ô eternall God,
we betake our ſelues, beſeeching
thee to pitch about the ruinous cotages
of our mortall bodies, the vnſhakeable
wals of thy grace and power,
that in proſperitie we may reioice
in thee, in aduerſitie be glad
in thee, in tribulations triumph in
thee; yea, euen in life and death
comfort our ſelues in thee, abandoning
all tranſitorie pleaſures as
meere toies, and turning out of the
wicket of our harts, which ought to
be kept faire and cleane for thee to
dwell in, all kind of fooliſh reioicing,
either in word, worke, or otherwiſe.

Grant this, wee beſeech
thee, for his ſake that deerelie
bought vs, Ieſus Chriſt thy ſonne
our ſauiour, Amen.

ſentence of the vertue
following.
                     
                        SOROWE is of two ſorts, good and
bad; both which are no leſſe diſcernable
by their effects, than the tree by the
fruite. Good ſorowe is of ſuch a working,
that it bringeth profit with it: and therefore
the Apostle hauing made the Church
of Corinth penſife and ſad with the Epistle
which he ſent them, ſaith plainelie
that hee repenteth not a whit thereof, but rather reioiceth; and why? becauſe he
made them ſorie to repentance, this ſorowe
can do no harme to him that falleth therinto.
                     As for euill ſorowe, which commonlie offendeth
in exceſſe: as it hindereth that
which may doo good, (for it refuſeth the
comfort of counſell, and the comfort of
praier) ſo alſo it hasteneth that which is

euill, euen death and the graue: and therfore
ſaith the wiſe man, Giue not thy hart
to ſorowe, but driue the ſame from thee. If
thou be heauie, keepe a meane: if thou be
merrie, vſe meaſure: praie in the one,
ſing pſalmes in the other.

                           O
                         Man, what is the
cauſe of this thy ſo
great and exceſſiue
reioicing? Haſt thou
of late vanquiſhed
Sathan the diuell? Haſt thou eſcaped
the paines of hell-fire? Haſt
thou recouered thy baniſhment,
and come to thy countrie? Haſt
thou gotten ſecuritie by thine election
or choice? Peraduenture the
ſaieng of thy Sauior is out of thy
memorie, The world ſhall laugh
and reioice, but you ſhall be heauie
and ſad; neuertheles, this your ſadnes
ſhall be turned into gladnes,
and pour gréefe into ioie.
                     
                        
Peraduenture alſo thou haſt forgotten
the words of thy redéemer,
Wo be vnto you which now doo
laugh, for yée ſhall wéepe and lament.
And Salomon ſaith, The
heart is ſorrowfull euen in laughter,
and the end of mirth is heauines.
Furthermore, although it be
affirmed by the ſame prudent king,
that a merrie hart is the life of the
bodie, yet is not immoderate reioicing
allowed by his words. For
thy ſauiour and redéemer ſpeaketh
thus to the contrarie, Bleſſed are
they that moorne, for they ſhall bée
comforted.
                     Remember, O man, the ſaieng of
Salomon the wiſe, That no man
knoweth whether he ſhall deſerue
to be loued or hated, and why? bicauſe
all things are kept doubtfull
&amp; vncertaine for the time to come.
And therefore, O man, vſe a meaſure
in thy reioicing, which is but
vaine and fooliſh, bicauſe thou canſt
not ſaie yet thou haſt eſcaped the
danger of damnation and hell-fire.
                     
                        
Is not he iudged a mad fellowe,
which lieng in priſon with irons
vpon his legs, hath his head full of
iollie robbins, as though he enioied
the fulnes and perfection of true
felicitie? Euen ſo, if thou ſhalt ſet
thy mind ſo much vpon mirth,
vaine-pleaſure, and delight, which
may mooue paſtime &amp; laughter, not
thinking vpon the eſtate of another
life hereafter, I ſaie vnto thée,
O man, I doubt of thy ſaluation.
                     For a certaine note and marke to
diſcerne Gods ſeruants by, is affliction
of bodie, and tribulation of
mind; which thou canſt not be
counted woorthie to partake, vnleſſe
thou caſt awaie that ill cuſtome
&amp; acquaintance, which thou
art growne into with immoderate
reioicing, and fooliſh delight.

                     O Almightie, and euer-liuing
God, forſomuch as the burthen

of our ſinnes being heauie and importable,
forceth vs to grone vnder
the weight therof, and diuers times
pricketh vs with the gode of inward
greefe, whereby we are beatdowne,
and kept vnder with conſuming anguiſh,
and brought almoſt euen to
the pits brinke of deſperation: we
beſeech thee to powre into our
harts but one little drop of thy good
and gratious ſpirit, which may fortifie
and make vs ſtrong againſt all
the enimies of our ſoules health;
and that we may be ſorie and greeued
for our miſdeeds, but yet (Lord)
to our comfort and amendment,
not to our ouerthrowe &amp; confuſion.
                     Moreouer, becauſe this fraile and
wretched life of ours, lieth wide open,
like a citie without a wall, or
as a vineyard without a hedge, to
the inuaſion of manie calamities,
whereof ſome touch our owne eſtate,
otherſome our freends, manie
our deere children and kindred,
not a few our goods and ſubſtance,
an infinite number our bodilie

health, which is ſundrie times ſhaken
with manie a ſharpe ſurge of
ſicknes: vouchſafe vs in reſpect of
theſe neceſſarie and vnauoidable
afflictions allotted to this life, a relenting
hart, and a greeued mind;
knowing that our ſins haue let in
all theſe, and a thouſand miſeries
more, to increaſe and aggrauate our
torment.
                     The example of thy ſon, ô mercifull
father, lamenting the death
of Lazarus, and bewailing the ruine
of Ieruſalem, which he propheſied
before it came to paſſe, teacheth
vs how we ſhould be affected
and minded in the execution of thy
corrections and chaſtiſements on
others, or on our ſelues: which being
a principall patterne, and ſo
ſound in all aſſaies, as a better or
more auaileable cannot be thought
vpon, much leſſe followed, we craue
the aſſiſtance of thy grace to preuent
vs in all our actions and attempts,
ſo ſhall wee bee ſure to bee
trained vnto that ſorowe, which to

thy Maieſtie is allowable, &amp; to our
ſelues moſt profitable. Heare vs
ſweet Father, and grant our ſute,
for Ieſus ſake, Amen.

                     1 S. BARNARDS golden
ſentence of the vice
inſuing.
                     
                        WHO is able to number the great
enormities, which the tongue, a
verie little member, doth procure? Who
can tell how manie times double the filthines
and vncleannes is, which lieth
thickened and tempered in vncircumciſed
lips? Who is able to ſhew what great
harme and danger is ſhut vp in an vndiſcret
and fooliſh mouth?
                     The tongue is liberall to laſh out idle
words largelie; the tongue is bawdie, and
alſo boasteth: the first whereof bewraieth
diſhonestie, the other arrogancie. The
tongue is deceiptfull, and alſo ſlanderous:
deceiptfull in lieng, and deceiptfull in

flattering: ſlanderous in open reuiling,
and ſlanderous in priuie backbiting. So
that now, if men of euerie idle word proceeding
out of their mouth, ſhall giue accompts
to God in the daie of iudgement;
how much more ſtreightlie of euerie lieng,
biting, wounding, wrongfull, proud, bawdie,
flattering and ſlanderous word?
                     How true is the ſentence my brethren,
that much babbling cannot be without
ſinne; and a talkatiue tongue no better
than a biting ſerpent, that a man full of
tittle tattle ſhall be abhorred, and he that
laboureth his lips become hatefull? Beſides
that, if by thy words, ô man, thou
ſhalt be iustified, and by thy words alſo
condemned; take heed to thy tongue, looke
well to thy communication.
                     Set not light by thy time miſpent in
vaine babbling. A word paſſeth awaie,
and cannot be cald in, if it be once out:
the time flitteth awaie alſo, and cannot be
recouered, if it be once gone. A foole doth
not perceiue this, and he that hath no
vnderstanding, marketh not what he hath
loſt. I would to God we might be excuſed
for the loſſe of our time onlie in idle talke,

and buſie bibble babble! But manie ſuffer
loſſe euen of their life, by vſing vaine
and vnneceſſarie words; and not onelie
that, but rob and ſpoile their brethren of
theirs. Wherefore keepe thy tongue, and
keepe thy life.

BABLING.
                     
                        
                           O
                         Man, thou haſt a
treaſure, which verie
few beſide thy ſelfe
doo poſſeſſe; and that
is a readie, an eloquent,
a ſmooth, and a ſwéet vtterance.
Thou excelleſt an infinite
number of people in the world, in
this ſingular and notable qualitie.
Manie preach out of pulpits, manie
plead at the barre, manie go in
embaſſage about their princes affaires,
in whome there ought to be,
and is, a quicknes and finenes of
ſpéech, differing from ordinarie vſe
and cuſtome of the multitude. But
yet (I ſpeake it to thine own commendation,

and to the better louing
and liking of thy ſelfe) they
come not néere thée by manie degrées.
                     And therefore, as thou art indued
with a rare abilitie; ſo I wiſh
thée to vſe it to thine owne praiſe &amp;
renowne. If thou heareſt a report,
neuer rehearſe it in companie, but
deliuer it readilie, enlarge it cunninglie,
continue it eloquentlie, and
end it orderlie. In all thy communication
&amp; talke, vſe manie words,
and ſpare not as occaſion ſerueth,
to tell two or thrée vntruths, to
make thy matter good. If thou be
earneſt in reaſoning againſt anie
man, oppreſſe him with multitude
of ſpéech, ſo ſhalt thou outface him,
and conſtraine him to kéepe ſilence.
                     A number there be, which hold
him wiſe, that ſpeaketh little; but
I count him a foole. For a readie
tongue is an argument of a quicke
wit, and of a well inſtructed mind.
And therefore, vnleſſe thou wilt be
thought and taken for a dumb idol,

vſe libertie of ſpéech in what companie
ſoeuer it be thy chance to
come.
                  
                  
                     3 A praier againſt the
former vice.
                     O Fountaine of all wiſedome, we
beſeech thee to drop into the
rotten and barren ſtocks of our old
withered harts, the ſap of thy holie
ſpirit, whereby we may come to the
feeling of our ſelues, whom our imperfections
haue kept long in a
trance.
                     And becauſe wee are charged to
ſpeake nothing, but that which may
edifie, and not offend; the gift of vtterance
being giuen vs to that intent,
and the vſe of our tongueſ
granted for that purpoſe: we beſeech
thy diuine goodnes to direct
our minds, that we may thinke nothing,
but that which is honeſt and
neceſſarie: and to gouerne our
mouths, that we may refraine from
all fond and vaine babbling; knowing

that it is a ſingular argument
of extreame follie, to accuſtome
our ſelues to much talkatiueneſſe,
and ſuperfluous ſpeech.
                     Beſides this, thy truth teacheth
vs, that we ſhall giue accompts at
the laſt daie, of euerie idle word
proceeding from vs: which ought
to kindle in vs a greater circumſpection
and carefulneſſe concerning
the vſe of our tongues, that we giue
them not libertie to laſh out what
they liſt, or whatſoeuer the cogitations
of a corrupt hart ſhall ſuggeſt
and miniſter therevnto; remembring
what thine Apoſtle bleſſed
Iames reporteth thereof, that it is a
ſmall member, but yet troubleſome,
and in deed (as he termeth it) a verie
world of wickednes.
                     Grant vnto vs, ô mercifull Father,
wiſedome and diſcretion, by whoſe
direction we may order our talke,
&amp; ſpeake in due ſeaſon, with regard
of the time, the perſon, the place,
and all other neceſſarie circumſtances:
that none be offended at

our follie, bewraied in immoderate,
exceſſiue, and inordinate babbling,
nor forced by our intollerable tatling,
to iudge vs buſie-bodies, &amp; ſo
conſequentlie peace-breakers, who
are curſſed by thine owne mouth; as
the contrarie are bleſſed. From this
enormitie, and all other, whereto
this ſinfull fleſh of ours is ſubiect,
deliuer vs we beſeech thee, ô gratious
God, for thine infinite mercie
ſake, which indureth for euer, Amen.

ſentence of the vertue
following.
                     
                        SILENCE is blameles, yea it is praiſwoorthie.
Good ſilence forbeareth to
brag vainelie. Good ſilence forbeareth to
blaſpheme boldlie. Good ſilence forbeareth
to murmur curstlie, and good ſilence
forbeareth to backbite lewdlie: then
let a vaine-boasting tongue, a bold blaſpheming
tongue, a curst murmuring
tongue, and a lewd backbiting tongue be
ſilent in vs; becauſe it is good in this fourfold

ſilence, to wait for the ſauing health of
our Lord.
                     Howbeit, ô man, I wiſh thee to be ſilent
in ſuch ſort, that thou hold not thy
peace quite, least by ſuch ſilence thou
cauſe the Lord to be ſilent. Speake vnto
God in confeſſion, against vaine-boaſting;
that thou maist haue pardon for
the time past. Speake vnto him in
thankes-giuing, againſt murmuring; that
thou maist find the greater fauour in the
time preſent. Speake vnto him in praier,
against mistrust; that thou maist obteine
glorie in the time to come. Confeſſe
I ſaie thy miſdeeds paſt, giue thanks
for things preſent, and heereafter praie
more deuoutlie and hartilie for the ioies
to come, that God may not be ſilent from
forgiuenes, from bountifulnes, nor from the
performance of his promiſe.
                  
                  
                     2 The REPVLSE giuen by diſcreet
SILENCE.
                     
                        
                           O
                         Man, in ſpeaking much, it
may bée thou ſhalt vtter
that which is good. But
what of that, ſéeing it happeneth

oftentimes, that communication
well and honeſtlie begon, in continuance
may become euill, filthie,
and wicked: the holie ſcripture giuing
authoritie héerevnto, and ſaieng,
Where much babbling is,
there muſt néeds be offence.
                     I grant, O man, that among innumerable
words, and infinite
talke, ſuch héed may be taken, that
filthie and diſhoneſt ſpéeches may
be well enough auoided: but I
praie thee tell mée, is it poſſible to
vſe no idle, vaine, and vnprofitable
words, whereof we are forewarned
to render an accompt? Examine
thy ſelfe, and determine of the
matter accordinglie. Of thy words
thou ſhalt be iuſtified, and of thy
words thou ſhalt be condemned,
ſaith the ſcripture. Now iudge if
thou hadſt not néed ſet a hatch before
thy tongue, that thou offend
not in the ſame.
                     The wiſe king Salomon reputeth
that man diſcréet, which hideth
his knowledge, and maketh

no vaunt thereof: contrariwiſe, he
termeth him a foole that is blabbing
manie things without diſcretion
or iudgement. In much babbling,
O man, there cannot chooſe
but be great abuſe; and the danger
of the tongue is ſo peſtilent, that it
had néed to be preuented by prudence,
grauitie, and ſobernes. He
that kéepeth his mouth, kéepeth
his life; but who ſo raſhlie openeth
his lips, deſtroieth himſelfe. What
a heauie caſe is this, that deſtruction
ſhould depend vpon the tongue;
and yet, O man, thou wilt not
leaue thy vaine babbling.
                     Who ſo kéepeth his mouth and
his tongue, the ſame kéepeth his
ſoule from troubles. In this ſentence
Salomon commendeth ſilence,
and condemneth much babbling;
the one neceſſarie and fruitfull,
the other néedles and hurtfull.
To conclude, in ſpeaking thou
muſt vſe a meaſure; yea ſometimes
it is good for thée to forbeare profitable
ſpéeches; according to the example

of the Pſalmiſt, I kept ſilence,
yea euen from good words.
                     It ſhould ſéeme by ſundrie ſpéeches
of the ſame bleſſed Prophet
Dauid, that by much babbling,
which is the peculiar exerciſe of
the tongue, great miſchiefe doth
grow. For, not all in vaine, he ſaith
thus; I ſaid I will take héed to my
waies, that I offend not in my
tongue. I will kéepe my mouth as
it were with a bridle. Doo thine
endeuour, O man, after his example,
to temper thy tongue; ſo
ſhalt thou bée ſure to be found
blameles of that vice, whereof thou
art giltie.
                  
                  
                     3 A praier for the former
vertue.
                     O Wel-ſpring of all vertue, teach
vs how to frame our ſpeech &amp;
communication to the glorie of thy
name, the benefit of our brethren,
&amp; the comfort of our owne ſoules;
wiſhing rather with ſilence to ſhew

ſome point of wiſdome, than by raſh
talke and much babling to declare
our doltiſh follie.
                     And forſomuch as we are taught
by the mouth of Salomon, that a
word ſpoken conuenientlie, and as
iuſt occaſion mooueth, is like apples
of gold with pictures of ſiluer, therby
commending ſilence vnto vs, as
a propertie praiſe-woorthie in the
prudent, which muſt be kept as time
and place requireth: we moſt humblie
beſeech thee, of thy woonted
clemencie and bountifulnes, which
neuer denied or withheld anie lawfull
thing required of faithfull ſuters,
to chalke out before vs a readie
waie to that ſober ſilence, which
ſo often is commended in thy holie
word, and ſo ſeldome vſed in the
world.
                     Lighten our harts, and by the
bright appearing of the ſunne of
knowledge, diſperſe and driue away
from the eies of our minds, the miſtie
and palpable clouds of ignorance,
that we may haue our feete

ſet in that right path, which may
conduct vs vnto him, in whom we
may learne a moſt notable and excellent
leſſon of ſilence, euen
Chriſt Ieſus thy ſonne, who in all
his ſufferings, paſſions, and agonies;
in all the villanies, reproches,
and contumelies of his enimies, opened
not his mouth, gaue not
twite for twite, rebuke for rebuke,
checke for checke: but like a ſheepe
before the ſhearer; or as a lambe
led to the ſlaughter, put vp all theſe
iniuries, and gaue his aduerſaries
not one fowle word.
                     In him we ſee the ſingular ſilence,
which euerie Chriſtian is bound in
conſcience to imitate and followe;
though not ſo exactlie, bicauſe our
Sauiour was not attainted with ſin,
which poiſon hath infected our bodies
and ſoules; yet proportionablie,
according to that meaſure of
grace, which we haue reciued from
aboue. Guide vs therevnto, ô mercifull
Father, by the illumination
of thy ſpirit, that framing our ſelues

after the example of thy ſonne, the
perfect paterne of all vertue, both
morall and intellectuall, wee may
pleaſe thine eternall Maieſtie with
our obedience, wherein thou art
more delighted, than in anie burnt
offering, or fuming incenſe. This
and all other neceſſaries towards
the leading of a godlie life, grant vs
for thy mercie ſake, Amen.

                        VNCLEANNES of life, although
it ſpring first of all in the hart, yet it
brancheth and ſhooteth out of euerie
member of the bodie. For the eies with
wanton looking, the tongue with vnchast
talking, the lips with diſhonest
kiſſing, the hands with filthie touching, the
bodie with beastlie abuſing; and finallie
euerie limme, with committing wickednes
is become vncleane, and by that

meanes the whole life of man is a meere
muckhill of vncleannes. Wilt thou then
learne to reforme this offenſiue miſchiefe?
                     Marke what I ſaie, and beare it in
mind. First of all labour thou to kill concupiſcence,
which is a ſore and a greeuous
ſinne, yea ſuch a ſinne, that it ouergroweth
both the inward and outward man, filling
them ſo full of maladies and diſeaſes, that
from the ſole of the foote to the crowne of
the head, there is no ſound place; concupiſcence
cauſeth ſuch an vniuerſall infection.
A hard matter it is to intermedle
therewith, and to ouercome it; neuertheles
keepe thy bodie in temperance and ſobernes,
and praie continuallie, for the ſpirit
of mortification.

and vncleannes
of LIFE.
                     
                        
                           O
                         Man, as thou haſt
the lordſhip and dominion
of all things,
committed and put
into thy hands, ſo it
is thy part to take thy pleaſure

and harts delight, euen to thy full
ſatiſfaction &amp; contentment. What
ſhouldeſt thou need to feare the forbidding
of fornication and adulterie
in the lawe? I will tell thée,
God ſhewed himſelfe too too ſeueare
and vniuſt, in giuing that commandement.
For, is it poſſible to
liue in ſuch chaſtitie, as is preſcribed
in ſcripture? No man, ſince
the creation, hath béene ſo honeſt
and vpright of life; but, in conſideration
of his nature, which is carnall
and fleſhlie, hath béene aſſalted
with concupiſcence and luſt.
                     Art thou more innocent than
Lot? He committed inceſt. Art
thou more holie than Dauid? He
offended in adulterie. Art thou wiſer
than Salomon? He tranſgreſſed
with the multitude of his
wiues and concubines. Art thou
ſtronger than Samſon? He was
too féeble to encounter with his paramour.
So then, thou ſéeſt, O
man, that theſe men, being mirrors
of the world, for the rarenes of

their gifts and ornaments, were
notwithſtanding ſubdued and ouercome
with the ſpirit of iniquitie.
And therefore make it not a
matter of ſuch conſcience, to follow
the luſt of thine eie; and to ſatiſfie
the deſire of thine hart. Dooeſt thou
ſée a faire woman, and art tempted
with the view of hir beautie? Why
ſerue thy féet, but to conuey thy bodie
to the place where ſhe is reſident?
                     Wherefore haſt thou a tongue,
but to vtter and declare the paſſions
of thy mind? What is the office
of thine armes, and why were
they giuen thée by 
                           ••
                        ture, but to
imbrace thy beloued? The caſe
ſtanding, as it ſéemeth; thou ſhalt
be giltie of the greater crime, and
bewraie the more follie, in offering
to reſiſt the motions of concupiſcence,
to the fulfilling wherof thou
haſt ſundrie bodilie abilities; than
in accuſtoming thy ſelfe ordinarilie
to the ſame.
                     Tut, a point; what is carnall

pleaſure, but a naturall diſpoſition,
and inclination bred in vs, euen in
our cradle and infancie? One beaſt
deſireth the companie of another;
ſo is it among birds, ſo is it among
fiſhes, ſo is it among ſerpents,
vermine, and flies. Why
then ſhouldeſt not thou, O man,
which haſt all things in ſubiection
vnder thée, enioie as large libertie;
naie, another maner of priuilege?
                     As I giue thée counſell to followe
and content the luſts of thine
eies and heart; ſo I wiſh thée to
vſe thy weapon like a man, that if
thou be iniuriouſlie abuſed, thou
maiſt reuenge thine own wrongs,
without appealing to anie magiſtrate
or iudge. And if it ſo fall out,
that thou maiſt not take vēgeance
in thine owne cauſe, procure notwithſtanding
one or other to doo
that, which thou deſireſt to haue
diſpatched.
                     For, no lawe is ſo ſtreight, but
it may be mitigated with a gift: no
ſtatute ſo rigorous, but it may be

appeaſed with a bribe: no penaltie
ſo great, but there may be meanes
found to paie it. And therefore, the
fulfilling of thy mind vpon thine enimie,
is a felicitie aboue all felicities,
and ſuch a thing, as thou
muſt not ſticke to run through fire
and water to bring it to perfection.
                     What though thou haue carnall
knowledge with thouſands? What
though thy hands haue ſhed much
bloud? Is it ſuch a heinous matter?
Diſpenſations or pardons
may be granted from princes, by
friendſhip and other meanes: as
for the eies of God, whome a companie
of prophane people, poſſeſſed
with the ſpirit of lieng, tearme the
ſearcher of hearts and reines, and
the ouerſéer of all men in their
trade of dealing: I ſaie he is otherwiſe
occupied in heauen, in the gouernment
of his celeſtiall hierarchie,
and hath no leiſure, neither
once vouchſafeth ſo much to abaſe
himſelfe, as to marke and note the
behauiour of men vpon earth. And

therefore followe my counſell, if
thou wouldeſt be at reſt; for then
enſueth quietnes of mind, when
the heart hath his deſire.

                     O Moſt iuſt iudge, and righteous
rewarder of iniquitie: wee beſeech
thee to haue mercie vpon vs
miſerable wretches, plunged ouer
head and eares in the puddle of
polluſion, and by ſtretching out thy

vs out of the clammie claie of corruption,
wherein we ſticke faſt euen

thou of thy goodnes and fauor
vouchſafe in time to reſcue vs, and
of thy free beneuolence ſet vs at libertie,
and purifie vs by the ſpirit of
ſanctification; that wee may auoid
the traps of Satan, and approch to
thy holie temple in newnes of life
and regeneration.
                     Giue vs grace, good Lord, to followe

the wholeſome admonition of
bleſſed Paule, exhorting vs to be ſo
farre from fornication and all vncleannes,
that it be not ſo much as
once named among vs, much leſſe
committed: knowing this, and being
well aſſured therof, as the faithfull
of their ſaluation: that no
whooremonger, nor vncleane perſon,
hath anie inheritance in the
kingdome of Chriſt: but ſhall be
excluded and ſhut out, as iudged
to haue their portion in the lake
which burneth with fire and brimſtone,
which is the ſecond death:
the iuſt reward of all ſuch as delight
in the works of darknes.
                     Heare vs, moſt mercifull Father,
making our mone vnto thee, without
whom all the world, and euerie
thing therein contained, is a verie
ſinke of vncleannes: and aſſiſt vs
with thine holie ſpirit, that by the
vertue thereof, we may mortifie our
earthlie members: namelie, fornication,
vncleannes, inordinate affection,
filthie fleſhlines, euill concupiſcence,

and whatſoeuer ſetteth
ſhoulder againſt thine holie lawe,
which ought to be our onelie direction,
in leading an holie, honeſt,
chaſte, and cleane life. This grace,
good Lord, and all other graces neceſſarie
for our ſoules health, wee
beſeech thee to grant vs, for our Sauiour
Ieſus Chriſts ſake, Amen.

ſentence of the vertue
following.
                     AN honest and cleane life is that,
which we commonlie call continencie.
By this chaſt continencie, or continent
chaſtitie, all the defilings of lecherous diſhonestie
are cleanſed, and quite waſhed
awaie. By this vertue, honest and cleane
continencie, the bodie is brideled, and kept
ſhort from gadding after the deadlie delights
of the fleſh. He that committeth
carnall filthines, offendeth against his
owne bodie, ſpoiling it of a ſpeciall honour;
&amp; diſgracing it with reprochfull ſhame;
in that he taketh the member of Christ,

and maketh it the member of an harlot.
                     It is not my meaning onelie, that wee
ſhould forbeare from a ſinne ſo abhominable;
but alſo from all pleaſure and delight
of the fleſh. For the holie Ghost will
not tarrie there, where anie vncleannes
resteth. Furthermore, that honestie or
continencie of life, which hunteth after the
praiſe of men, hath no reward at Gods
hands. And therefore it is needfull for vs
to haue a pure and vndefiled intent or
purpoſe, whereby our minds may couet to
pleaſe God, and be able alſo to cleaue fast
vnto him.
                     To cleaue fast vnto God, is nothing
elſe but to ſee God; which is granted onlie
to ſuch as be cleane harted. And trulie,
then is the vertue of continencie perfect,
when wee liuing togither with our
neighbours in the vnitie of faith, keepe
our ſelues from committing ſinne &amp; wickednes,
not for feare of puniſhment, or for
deſire of mens commendation; but onelie
for the loue, which we beare to God,
vnder whoſe ſafegard wee rest: bicauſe
continencie is not able to withstand the
mightie and manifold aſſaults of the

tempter, vnles it be defended and vnderſhored
with his grace.

and cleannes
of LIFE.
                     
                        
                           O
                         Man, looke into the
glaſſe of Gods moſt
holie word, and thou
ſhalt ſée from the beginning
to the ending
of the ſame, what terrible
threatenings, maledictions, and
curſſes, are thundered out againſt
all vncleane perſons: contrariwiſe,
what benedictions and bleſſings
are promiſed to the obedient obſeruers
of the lawe.
                     The Lord himſelfe, by the mouth
of Moſes, ſaith vnto his choſen
people the Iewes; and vnto thée,
O man: If thou walke in mine ordinances,
and kéepe my commandements
(meaning indéed, if thou
abhorre idolatrie, breake not my
ſanctified ſabboths, honor thy ſuperiours,
leade an honeſt &amp; cleane

life, 
                           〈◊〉
                         not thy 
                           〈◊〉
                        , which
was giuen thée pure and vnpolluted)
I will ſend thee raine in due
ſeaſon, increaſe of thy land, fruits
of thy trées, plentifull threſſhing,
an abundant vintage, quiet
dwellings, vniuerſall peace, ſound
ſléepe, victorie ouer thine enimies;
I will be thy God, and thou ſhalt
be my ſeruant.
                     On the other part, if thou neglect
the kéeping of the Lords lawe,
looke for none other reward, but
the contrarie curſſes to theſe bleſſings.
And therefore, O man, if
thou wilt liue in Gods fauour, and
auoid the heate of his wrath, take
héed how thou acquainteſt thy
ſoule with ſin, which ſtingeth vnto
death, if it obteine place to enter.
                     Not without great cauſe is vncleannes
cried out againſt in the
ſcripture, and moſt horrible puniſhments
denounced againſt it,
that thou mighteſt be terrified, and
become fearefull to fall into ſuch a
foule offence. Doo but looke vpon

the curſſed waters, which the adulterous
woman, in the time of
Moſes lawe, was enioined to
drinke; whereby hir bellie moſt
irkeſomlie did ſwell, and hir thigh
rot, as it hoong vpon hir bodie; to
declare that God is highlie diſpleaſed
with ſuch filthines.
                     An example of his indignation
againſt his peculiar people, thou
maiſt ſée in the ſcripture, &amp; learne to
deteſt all vncleannes, ſpeciallie that
beaſtlines of the fleſh. The Iſraelites
abiding in Sittim, began
to commit whooredome with the
daughters of Moab; wherevpon
they grewe to be idolatrers and image-woorſhippers,
contrarie to
that which they were commanded.
What followed? Were not all the
heads of the people commanded to
be hanged againſt the ſunne? And
were not Zamrie the Iſraelite,
and Coſbie the Madianite, both of
them deſcended of honourable houſes,
thruſt through euen in the verie
committing of carnall luſt and

vncleannes, with the iaueling of
Phinées, the ſonne of Eleazar.
                     If examples may withdrawe thée
from dooing ſuch wickednes, thou
haſt ſtore of them in the ſcripture:
if precepts and admonitions, thou
canſt not ſo ſoone open Gods booke,
but thou ſhalt find plentie for thine
inſtruction and learning. If neither
of theſe can worke with thée,
but that thou continueſt at a ſtaie;
O then wo be to thée, O man: for
thou art ſold ouer vnto ſin, and
there is little or no hope of thy recouerie.
                     Conſider the words of Sainct
Paule, and imprint them in thy
memorie: the ſame counſell that he
gaue the Corinthians, I giue thée;
not to be an idolatrer, not to be a
murmurer, not to be lead by luſt,
not to be a dronkard; and to conclude,
not to be a fornicator, or vncleane
perſon. The ſame Apoſtle
elſe-where, vſeth words well worthie
to be marked and remembred.
Knowe ye not (ſaith he) that the

vnrighteous ſhall not inherit the
kingdome of God? Be not deceiued:
neither fornicators, nor idolaters,
nor adulterers, nor effeminate,
nor abuſers of themſelues
with man-kind, nor théeues, nor
couetous, nor dronkards, nor reuilers,
nor extortioners, ſhall inherit
the kingdome of God.
                     Heere thou ſéeſt, O man, all vncleannes
condemned. Thou ſeeſt
alſo how the workers of wickednes
are rewarded. And therefore,
followe the good aduiſe of the ſame
Apoſtle, to kéepe thy veſſell pure in
holines, and by no meanes to make
thy members the members of an
harlot, ſeing thy whole bodie is appointed
to be the temple of the holie
Ghoſt, where he will not vouchſafe
to dwell, if thou ſuffereſt the ſame
to become filthie and vncleane.
                  
                  
                     3 A praier for the former
vertue.
                     O Father of mercie, and God of
all conſolation; we moſt humblie

beſeech thy diuine Maieſtie, to
giue vs grace to take heed to our
ſelues, that wee exceede not the
bounds of honeſtie, nor keepe companie
with ſuch as are counted diſhoneſt
and lewd liuers; by whoſe
euill example, all good inclination
naturallie graffed in vs is choked,
godlie motions pliable to Chriſtian
purpoſes peruerted, the whole
courſe of our life corrupted, our
vertues blemiſhed, our vices cheriſhed,
our bodies abuſed, our ſoules
defiled, and thy glorious name diſhonoured.
                     Powre into vs the ſpirit of chaſtitie,
which abounded in Ioſeph;
which ouerflowed in Suſan; that
being therewith harneſſed, as with
complete armour, wee may gainſtand,
repell, and award all the
blowes of temptation, ſent from Satan
the prince of this world, to aſſault
vs, and with ſundrie ſubtill and
ſugred aſſaies to circumuent, and
vndermine vs, to the end we might,
by his malicious meanes, pollute

our veſſels with the dregs of filthines;
which thou, ô Father, haſt commanded
vs to keepe holie and vndefiled,
for thy ſelfe to inhabit and
dwell in.
                     Mortifie euerie member of vs,
both inward and outward, with the
ſword of thy ſpirit, which is thine
eternall word, whereby we may be
ſanctified, and withdrawne from all
kind of affections ſauouring of vncleannes
(than which nothing is
more odious and abhominable in
thy ſight) and not like the Scribes
and Phariſes, ſcowre and clenſe the
outſide of the cup or platter, leauing
the inſide furd as it were with
filthines: but waſhing and wiping
euen our verie hearts from euill
thoughts, our mouthes from lewd
ſpeech, our eies from viewing vanitie,
and all the parts of our bodies
from ſtinking naſtines; that being
cleane within and without, we may
in due time approch to thee, ô God,
and ſee thee face to face: which
grant we beſeech thee for his ſake,

whoſe bloud hath made vs cleane,
euen Ieſus Chriſt thy beloued ſon,
and our bleſſed Sauiour, Amen.

                     1 S. BARNARDS golden
ſentence of the vice
inſuing.
                     
                        LECHERIE or vncleane life is a
mightie prince of the ſpirituall and
inuiſible Aegypt, riding in a chariot or
wagon of foure wheeles: namelie, bellie-cheere,
fleſhlie lust, costlie brauerie, and
drowſines. This wagon is drawne with
two horſes: the first proſperitie of life, the
ſecond plentie of all things. Theſe two
horſes are ruled by two riders: the first
laſie idlenes, the ſecond faithleſſe careleſneſſe.
                     For plentie breedeth idlenes, and according
to the Scripture, the proſperitie of
fooles is their owne destruction; for none
other reaſon doubtles, but bicauſe it maketh
them ſecure and retchles: inſomuch
that when they ſhall ſaie, Peace, peace, all

is well, and there is no dread of danger;
then, euen then ſhall they be ouertaken
with a ſudden ouerthrowe. Theſe two riders
haue no ſpurres on their heeles, nor
whips in their hands; n
                           •
                        r anie ſuch like
thing to driue the horſes withall: but in
ſtead of them, they vſe a canopie to cast
a ſhadowe, and a fan to gather wind withall.
This canopie is diſſimulation, casting
a ſhadowe against the ſcorching heate of
cares.
                     For it is proper to a ſoft, tender, nice,
and delicate ſoule, euen to diſſemble and
be aſhamed of neceſſarie cares; the parching
heate whereof that they may not
feele, they hide themſelues vnder the
ſhrowd of diſſimulation. The fan is franknes
or ſpend-all, gathering the wind of
flatterie. For bawdie and lecherous perſons
are verie franke and free, ſparing for
no cost, and buieng wind for gold at the
eares of flatterers. This boiling lust of lecherie
riſeth of a wicked and lewd cauſe;
and trulie, vnles it be preſentlie quenched
and quailed, it will ſuddenlie ouerſwaie
all the bodie, ſet it on fire, and burne
it. At the first it tickleth the fleſh a little

with touching; afterwards it poiſoneth
the mind with filthie delight; &amp; last of
all, by conſenting to ſinne, and willingnes
to worke wickednes, both bodie and ſoule
are ſubdued and ouercome.
                  
                  
                     2 The ASSALT giuen by filthie
LECHERIE.
                     
                        
                           O
                         Man, neuer caſt this
ſtumbling-blocke before
thy conſcience,
that leacherie is a
deadlie ſin, and deſerueth
damnation. Why maieſt thou
not without anie remorſe or care,
vſe thine owne bodie to thy harts
delight? Such pleſures as are ordeined
for thée to poſſeſſe and enioie,
it is reaſon thou ſhouldeſt,
without let or hinderance, haue
them in fruition. Haſt thou opportunitie
of time, and due ſeaſon to
ſerue thy deſires? Take it then, &amp;
neglect not ſuch conuenient offers.
For time paſſeth, and it hapneth in
an houre, that hapneth not in ſeuen
yeare.
                     
                        
The eie muſt be ſatiſfied with
ſéeing, the eare with hearing, the
tong with talking, the lips with
kiſſing, the armes with imbracing,
and other parts of the bodie
muſt haue their due recreation; otherwiſe,
vnquietnes will inſue to
the diſturbance of the verie heart,
with melancholie &amp; madnes. Manie
haue béene buſie to bridle their
luſts and fleſhlie affections; but
they haue béen glad to giue ouer
their enterpriſe. For the concupiſcences
of the heart are wild beares
to bind, and fierce monſters that
refuſe to be tamed.
                     That which is naturall in thée,
O man, and not diſhonest, ſéeke not
by ſiniſter meanes to ſuppreſſe; and
take this leſſon for thy learning,
that to vndertake the maiſtering of
ſuch motions as are bred in thy
bones, and will neuer be rooted out
of thy fleſh, is to wreſtle with the
wind, and to caſt water into the
ſea. Againe, be perſuaded by counſell
and reaſon, if thou be wiſe and

prudent. For the luſt of bodie is
neither to be diſcommended, nor
yet condemned; though ſome both
raſhlie and falſlie laſh out lies, ſaieng,
that it is a ſin which ſhutteth
thée out of heauen. That can not be
ſo. For can any creature ſée further
into the nature of things, than the
creator himſelfe? But the creator
himſelfe would not prohibit or forbid
thée, O man, the pleaſure of the
fleſh in carnall copulation, which a
companie of dizzards call the ſin of
leacherie, when in déed it is no ſin;
bicauſe it beginneth with loue, and
endeth with repentance: and therefore
why ſhould anie one beſide
him, attempt to perſwade, or exhort
thée to the contrarie?
                     It is certaine, that God denied
not that delight vnto thée, becauſe
he gaue no expreſſe commandement
to forbeare it: and he allowed
it, becauſe he ſuffered the ſame to
be enioied before-time, euen in the
beginning: he permitted and miſliked
it not, but rather thought it

verie needfull and conuenient, that
man ſhould haue his peculiar delectation
with his woman, as well
as other creatures in their proper
kind; or elſe he would not haue
made them hée and ſhée in the generall
creation.
                     And therefore, O man, eſtéeme
it no matter of conſcience to vſe thy
bodie to pleaſure, and to ſatiſfie thy
fleſh, when it is kindled and ſet on
fire with the concupiſcence and
luſt of that which it liketh and loueth.
For to doo otherwiſe, bréedeth
a penſiueneſſe and moleſtation of
mind, and a diſquieting of euerie
member.
                  
                  
                     3 A praier againſt the
former vice.
                     O Almightie God; we, euen we,
who a long time haue ſate in
the ſeate of ſinners, followed the
trace which we found fore-troden,
and ſet our ſelues aworke in dooing
diuers things vtterlie againſt the

lawe of thy commandements, doo
heere humble and throwe downe
our ſelues, vile duſt, aſhes, and
woormes-meate, at the footſtoole of
thy mercie-ſeate, beſeeching thee to
pardon all our miſdeeds and follies
paſt, at the greatnes and greeuouſnes
whereof, we quake and
tremble; to baniſh them out of the
borders of our hearts, where they
haue harbored long, and to put new
tenants in poſſeſſion, euen cleane
thoughts, holie talke, honeſt deeds,
and whatſoeuer elſe may ſtand with
the credit of Chriſtianitie.
                     O Lord, giue vs not ouer to the
luſts of the fleſh, leaſt through frailtie
and want of grace, we commit
ſinne with greedines, and ſo denieng
thee in our liues, whome wee
profeſſe with our lips, heape vpon
our owne heads hell and condemnation.
Let not lecherie keepe vs
in bondage, ô let not ſo ouglie and
deadlie a ſin reigne in our mortall
bodies, let it not take roote in vs, ô
let it not bloome and bloſſome in

our earthlie members, leaſt we burgening
and growing like ranke
weeds, bring foorth in fine the fruits
of endles confuſion.
                     A deteſtable vice it is, ô Lord, we
knowe right well; the dangers
therevpon depending are deadlie,
the miſeries lamentable, the temporall
plagues irkeſome, the eternall
torments vnſufferable, all
which conſidered, with the dread
of thy iudgement, oftentimes executed
with ſudden vengeance; ſhall
we be ſo graceleſſe, as to make our
bodies brothell-houſes of Satan, cages
of vncleane birds, neſts of venemous
ſerpents, and indeed verie
dens of diuels? O God forbid! Deliuer
vs, ſweet Lord, from this deſperate
downe-fall, hold vs vp with
thy hand, that we ſtumble not, and
at all aſſaies aſſiſt vs with thy ſpirit,
that thereby as with a ſharpe
ſyeth, wee cutting in peeces that
poiſonfull ſcorpion lecherie, may
not feare hir ſting anie more, which
woundeth vnto death. From this

ſinne, and all ſinnes noiſome to our
ſoules and bodies, ſet vs free for thy
mercie ſake, ô almightie GOD,
Amen.

                        VNſpotted CHASTITIE is the
onlie iewell, which in this mortall life
repreſenteth vnto vs a certaine ſtate of
eternall glorie. Vnſpotted chastitie is the
onelie thing, which at the ſolemnities of
mariage ſetteth before vs a forme of
that bleſſed countrie, where wee ſhall not
marie, nor be maried: giuing vs in this
our earthlie booth a proofe of that ſame
celestiall conuerſation, which wee shall
lead in the life to come with the Saints.
                     This veſſell which we beare about is
brickle, fraile, and manie times in danger:
howbeit chastitie keepeth and preſerueth
it for ſanctification, yea like most ſweete
ſmelling balme it perfumeth our carcaſes,
making them trim and ſauourie, as if
they were ſeaſoned with the purest ſpice.
                     Vnſpotted chastitie brideleth the ſenſes,

and ſnaffleth the lims, least otherwiſe
they might ſoke in idlenes and eaſe, run a
rioting after lewd deſires, and beecome
ranke and rotten with the pleaſures of the
fleſh. But yet for all this, chastitie, how
beautifull &amp; amiable ſo euer it ſeeme in
ſhew, is nothing woorth, without charitie:
it is of no value, of no price, of no eſtimation,
void of credit, merit, &amp; deſart. And
no maruell. For without charitie what
good thing can be vndertaken, had, or obteined?
Faith: yea but that auaileth little,
though it mooue mountaines. Knoweledge:
yea but that profiteth little, though
it ſpeake with the tongues of men and
angels. Martyrdome: yea but that helpeth
little, though I offer my bodie to be
burned. Chastitie void of charitie, is a
lampe lacking oile. Take awaie oile, &amp; the
lampe is not lightſome: take awaie charitie,
and chastitie is not delightſome.

                           O
                         Man, I would not haue
thée ignorant what thy
reward ſhall be after this

life. For if thou liueſt chaſtlie and
holilie, thy ioie and happines ſhall
be euerlaſting: if diſhoneſtlie and
wickedlie, thou ſhalt haue thy portion
in eternall torments of hellfire.
Furthermore, it is méete alſo,
O man, that thou endeuour to liue
the more chaſtlie, becauſe thou
canſt not tell how ſoone the acceptable
time of grace and repentance
will paſſe awaie.
                     And although God in the beginning
of the world, made man and
woman, to kéepe companie, and the
one to take pleaſure of the other,
yet thereby it was not his godlie
meaning to approoue or allow licentiouſnes
of life, but rather to eſtabliſh
and confirme matrimonie
vpon earth, that ſuch as had not
the gift of virginitie and chaſtitie,
might with ſafetie of conſcience
preſume vpon that preſent remedie
of marriage, which the Lord in his
own perſon ordeined &amp; eſtabliſhed.
                     As for the filthie ſin of lecherie,
fornication, or adulterie, none may

be ſo bold as to commit them, for
feare of perill following héere vpon.
And that it is no ſight ſin to defile
thine owne bodie, learne by the
words of the Apoſtle. For dooeſt
thou not marke, O man; or dooeſt
thou take that for a vaine toie,
which S. Paule ſpeaketh to leacherers,
&amp; luſters of ſtrange fleſh?
Flie fornication my brethren (ſaith
hée:) for euerie ſin which a man
committeth, is without the bodie,
but he that plaieth the fornicator;
offendeth againſt his owne bodie.
                     If thou eſtéemeſt this for a thing
of naught, liſten vnto that which
will make thée lament and wéepe,
if thou haſt anie drop of grace in
thy hart or entrailes; Neither adulterers,
nor fornicators, nor abuſers
of themſelues with mankind,
ſhall inherit the kingdome of
God. Againe, the ſame Apoſtle ſetting
downe a rabble of fleſhlie
works, doth not omit this filthie
vice, and concludeth as before ſaieng:
The works of the fleſh are

adulterie, fornication, vncleannes,
wantonnes, wrath, ſtrife, enuieng,
murthers, gluttonie, dronkennes,
and ſuch like; of the which I told
you before, &amp; tell you now againe,
that euen they, which doo ſuch
things, ſhall not inherit the kingdome
of God.
                     And yet further in this matter,
he ſpareth not to expreſſe his mind
elſe-where, ſaieng: As for fornication
and all vncleannes, let it not
be once named among you, as it
becommeth Saincts; neither filthines,
neither fooliſh talking, neither
ieſting, which are not comelie.
And why? Becauſe no whoremonger,
neither vncleane perſon,
&amp;c. hath anie inheritance in the
kingdome of Chriſt, and of God.
                     To conclude therfore, I put thée
in memorie of the ſentence of S.
Iohn, deſcribing the holie citie of
God, new Ieruſalem, and the glorie
of the ſame, into the which he
affirmeth flatlie, nothing that is
vncleane ſhall enter: for without

ſhall be dogs, inchanters, whoremongers,
murtherers, idolatrers,
liers, and ſuch like.
                     By theſe contraries, O man, and
their reward, thou maiſt iudge
what a pretious thing it is to
kéepe thy bodie chaſte, to liue honeſtlie,
ſoberlie, and acceptablie before
God and men, that thy walking
may be after the example of
Chriſt Ieſus thy ſauiour, whome
if thou imitate and followe with
vnfeigned affection, thou canſt not
doo amiſſe.
                  
                  
                     3 A praier for the former
vertue.
                     O Eternall GOD, Father of our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who by the
mouth of thy ſonne our Sauiour
Ieſus Chriſt, haſt told vs of three
kinds of chaſtitie: the firſt naturallie
ingraffed, the ſecond artificiallie
procured, and the third celeſtiallie
obteined; ech one whereof
ſhooteth at a certaine marke, is vndertaken

for a ſpeciall end, and riſeth
of ſome materiall cauſe; as of
infirmitie, neceſſarie policie, and
deſire to ſerue thee with free libertie;
which is a verie beneficiall kind
of chaſtitie, drawing with it the
complete and full dutie of Chriſtianitie;
wee craue of thy gratious
goodnes the entire practiſe &amp; perfect
vſe of the laſt, holding our
ſelues content with the bare knowledge
of the ſecond and the firſt.
                     Alſo moſt mercifull Father, bicauſe
this is the chaſtitie, which
proceedeth from thy diuine influence
(in compariſon whereof, the
two former are but flouriſhes as it
were and ſhadowes) which manie
of thy Saints haue imbraced for the
kingdome of heauens ſake, that being
furtheſt off from all tranſitorie
concupiſcences, of ſeeing, hearing,
ſmelling, taſting, and feeling, they
might be the neerer to true &amp; eternall
felicitie, which is then moſt
likelie to be obtained, when we renounce
the world, and all trifling

vanities.
                     Therefore, euen therfore, ô Lord,
euen for the participation of thy
kingdome, and the ioies thereof,
whereat thy Saints haue directed
their liues, by the iuſt line and leuell
of vnſpotted chaſtitie, keeping
their veſſels pure and ſanctified for
the honorable ſeruice whereto they
are appointed: wee craue at thy
hands the ſelfe-ſame ornament and
rich ouch of innocencie, the ſelfe-ſame
iewell of ſpotleſſe virginitie,
the ſelfe-ſame tablet of true temperance:
that treading the trace which
they trode, and not miſtaking our
aime giuen vs by their good examples,
we may obtaine the reward of
our chaſtitie; euen the white ſiluerlike
gliſtering robes of Saints and
angels, with them to liue euerlaſtinglie
and world without end, in
the heauen of heauens, whereto
hee bring vs ſpeedilie,
that bought vs deerlie,
Amen.

                     1 S. BARNARDS golden
ſentence of the vice
inſuing.
                     
                        WHOORDOME of the hart, or
inward fornication is nothing elſe
but concupiſcence, which buſieth the
mind with vnlawfull deſires, and poiſoneth
all the lims of the bodie with venemous
baits. Hereof ſpringeth itching of
the eares, wanton winking with the eies,
pleaſant ſmelling with the noſe, delicate
and curious tasting with the tongue; finallie,
a maruellous nicenes of all the ſenſes,
wherewith the whole man being at
length ouergrowne, is no more a veſſell of
ſanctification, but rather a tumbrell of
all abhomination.
                     That this whordome, though it be priuie;
and this fornication, though it be ſecret; is
odious in the ſight of God, and flatlie. forbidden:
harken, ô man, to the wiſedome of
the holie Ghost, &amp; learne how dangerous
an infection it is. S. Iames ſaith, that God

tempteth no man to wickednes, but it is
the worke of concupiſcence, which bringeth
foorth ſinne, and ſinne when it is ripe,
ingendereth death. So that in reſpect of
Gods iustice and righteouſnes, betweene
inward fornication and outward, there is
no difference touching the puniſhment;
albeit in the cies of man the ods is farre
vnlike.
                     And therefore in conſideration of the
danger depending therevpon, and foreſeene
by the wiſedome of God, thou art
thus taught out of Gods booke, not to
gaze on a maid, least thou be allured to
lust after that, which is pretious in hir:
not to looke narrowlie vpon a womans
beautie, least thou be intiſed to wantonnes
and daliance, when loue is once kindled,
and flameth like a fire. To conclude,
abhor this ſinne, ô man, ſo much the more,
bicauſe Christ himſelfe hath auouched,
that Whoſoeuer lusteth after a woman,
to worke wantonnes, &amp; commit follie with
hir, hath plaid the adulterer in his
hart, and by that meanes is
fallen into the gilt of
fornication.
                  
                  
                     
                     2 The ASSALT giuen by inward
fornication, or whoredome
of the hart.
                     
                        
                           O
                         Man, if thou haſt
anie light of reaſon,
any ſparke of iudgement
&amp; vnderſtanding,
tell me this in
conſcience and truth; if hée that
conſenteth to luſt in his heart, and
committeth not the actuall déed of
concupiſcence, offend in ſuch ſort
as to deſerue damnation? I thinke
no, and I will auouch no leſſe than
I ſpeake. For, why ſhould he that
conceiueth a thing in his mind,
and putteth neither hand nor foote
to the accompliſhment of the ſame,
be iudged an offender. All lawe is
againſt it, all equitie diſaloweth it,
conſcience miſliketh it, and iuſtice
will not agrée vnto it.
                     If thou ſée a faire houſe, a beautifull
woman, a fruitfull vineyard,
a pleaſant garden, and wiſheſt in
thine heart to haue reall poſſeſſion,

not giuing the attempt by anie
outward action apparant to the eie
of ſhine inward luſt, who ſhall be
ſo bold as to come foorth, and accuſe
thée of offence? If thou canſt
be charged with no miſdéed, why
ſhouldeſt thou be counted guiltie?
if void of crime, why condemned?
                     Followe my counſell therefore in
this manner and forme as I ſet it
before thée. Dooeſt thou ſée hir
whome thine eie highlie pleaſeth?
Is ſhe a Gentlewoman, is ſhe ſo
manie degrées aboue thy baſe eſtate,
that all and the onelie delight
which thou art like to haue
by hir, is in viewing hir amiablenes?
Well, content thée therewith,
and féed thy fanſie with a firme
and faſt fixed conceipt of hir fauour;
let hir be déeplie imprinted in
thy thought and cogitation, and
ſuppoſe thou haſt by hir as much
pleaſure and voluptuouſnes, as by
a meaner woman.
                     For, where action is hindered by
occaſion of ſome circumſtance,

there cogitation may haue libertie
to run at randon.
                     And though the members of thy
bodie, by inſtrumentall touching
may not be admitted to doo their office;
yet it ſhall be frée for thée to
feed thy wanton eie, to ſuffice thy
tickliſh fanſie and vnbrideled luſt.
Spare not ſo to doo, for it is no offence;
the ſecrets of thy ſoule are
knowne to none but thy ſelfe, and
therefore none being able to accuſe
thée, thou ſhalt néed none to excuſe
thée.
                  
                  
                     3 A praier againſt the
former vice.
                     O Almightie and eternall God,
forſomuch as we are led by the
priuie and vnſpied deſires of our
corrupt harts, into manie an outragious
and ouglie ſinne; naie rather
floong head-long into full ſeas of
moſt accurſed crimes: for that they
are the ſparkles, whereby the flames
of manie a foule abuſe are kindled,

which alſo gathering force by degrees,
muſt needs in time violentlie
burne, according to the wiſe ſentence
of Salomon, that no man can
carie fire in his boſome, &amp; his cloths
vnſindged; nor go vpon hot coles,
and his feete vnbliſtered: therefore
we beſeech thee, gard vs about with
thy grace, againſt this ſpreading
poiſon.
                     O ſuffer not the ſoules of thy ſeruants
to become ſinks of vncleane
luſts, by whoſe noiſomnes whatſoeuer
portion of thy ſpirit we poſſeſſe
is quenched, and all goodnes
vtterly conſumed. Let not vs, whom
thou haſt vouchſafed to partake the
fruits of thy deerlie beloued ſonnes
death and paſſion, ſerue like ſlaues
vnder the banner of the fleſh. For
what an intollerable apoſtaſie and
reuolting were that, to forſweare
and renounce the truth of the promiſe,
which we made to thee in our
baptiſme; that we would forſake
the diuell, the world, the fleſh, with
all the pomps, vanities, and abhominations

of the ſame? Out alas!
better had it beene for vs neuer to
haue beene borne, than to be conuinced
and found guiltie of ſuch an
vnpardonable treſpas.
                     And therefore Lord, for that loue
ſake, wherewith thou ſo louedſt vs,
being thine enimies, that thou gaueſt
thine onelie begotten ſonne to
die for our iuſtification; for that
loues ſake keepe vs in the due execution
of thy will, in obedience to
thy lawe, in reuerence and dread of
thy commandements, in loue of thy
mercie, in feare of thy iudgements,
and finalie in mindfulnes of death:
ſo ſhall we be ſure, not onelie to
mortifie and kill all the luſts of vncleannes,
but alſo to walke before
thee with a pure hart; which grace,
ô God, grant vs, Amen.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     1 S. BARNARDS golden
ſentence of the vertue
following.
                     
                        WILT thou learne, ô man, what
inward chastitie and cleannes of

hart is; then conſider the contrarie, that by
the vilenes of the one, thou maist learne
the excellencie of the other. It is naturallie
graffed in euerie reaſonable creature,
to fanſie the best things, and ſtill to couet
more, though he haue enough: yea, ſuppoſe
that whatſoeuer he hath, be pure and
good; yet ſo rauenous are his deſires, and ſo
inſatiable his hart, that he thinketh better
of other mens, than his owne. For doubtles
it is a thing vnpoſſible, to tedder &amp; tie in
concupiſcence, or to appoint it much or
little, till it be ſatiſfied, till it be filled, till
it haue got wherewith to be contented.
As for example. He that hath a faire wife,
wiſheth a fairer in his hart, and is bewitched
with a wanton eie. He that goeth
gorgeous and gaie, ſetteth his mind vpon
costlier and brauer attire. He that ſwimmeth
in wealth, hunteth after more, repining
at him that is richer. The moniemonger
will neuer ſaie, I haue enough.
The whooremonger will neuer ſaie, I haue
enough. The bloud-thirstie murtherer
will neuer ſaie, I haue enough. The ambitious
vain-glorious man will neuer ſaie,
I haue enough: and ſo of the rest.
                     
                        
What is the cauſe of this inſatiablenes,
which hath no end, which hath no botome?
Euen an vncleane hart, a corrupt hart, a
defiled hart, an vnchast hart, which runneth
a whoring after other mens goods, &amp;
will in no wiſe be content with his owne. A
cleane &amp; pure hart is the dwelling-houſe
of Chriſt. In ſuch a hart reaſon is ſo far
frō error, that it agreeth with mans will.
For mans will loueth ſuch a reaſon, and
ſuch a reaſon mans will. Let thy will be
void of vncleannes, bicauſe right reaſon
alloweth ſuch a will.
                     Cleannes of hart cauſeth quietnes of
conſcience. For if the hart be chast, the
conſcience is not troubled; bicauſe ſuch
chastitie and cleannes is a mortifieng of
the earthlie members, a taming, a bringing
downe, and a keeping vnder of corrupt
affections, which are the torches that
ſet the towe of euill deeds on fire. To the
cleane harted, bleſſednes is promiſed; to
the vncleane harted, curſednes is threatened:
the one ſhall dwell in the Lords
tabernacle; the other in the diuels dungeon:
the one ſhall rest in Gods holie
hill; the other in the vallie of death: the

one ſhall liue with the Lambe euerlaſtinglie;
bicauſe they are chast virgins:
the other with the Gote (Satan I meane)
bicauſe they are ranke harlots.
                  
                  
                     2 The REPVLSE giuen by inward
CHASTITIE, or
vndefilednes of
heart.
                     
                        
                           O
                         Man, thou art a greuous
offender, if thou
kéepe not the chaſtitie
and virginitie of
thy ſoule. For marke
what the author of perfection, innocencie,
and cleannes vttereth in
the Goſpell; Whoſoeuer (ſaith he)
looketh vpon a woman to luſt after
hir, he hath committed fornication
with hir alreadie in his heart.
                     To the contrarie whereof, that
patient man Iob hath this ſpéech;
I haue made a couenant with
mine eies, that I ſhould not ſo
much as thinke vpon a woman.
For how great a portion ſhall I
haue of God from aboue, and what

inheritance of the almightie from
on high? Is not deſtruction prepared
for the wicked, and ſome
ſtrange thing for the workers of
iniquitie?
                     Furthermore, if there were not
deadlie danger, euen in concupiſcence
of the eie and the heart, it is
not like that he would haue burſt
out with vehemencie into theſe
ſpéeches; If mine heart hath walked
after mine eies, if it hath béene
deceiued by a woman, or if I haue
laid wait at my neighbours dore,
then let my wife grind vnto another
man, and let other men lie
with hir.
                     It is good for thée therefore to
haue the petition of the Prophet
Dauid alwaies freſh in memorie:
O Lord turne awaie mine eieſ,
that they behold not vanitie. Embrace
the wholeſome counſell of
wiſe Salomon, Luſt not after a
womans beautie in thine heart,
leaſt thou be taken with hir faire
lookes.
                     
                        
Moreouer, if it were not ſo, that
the verie thought of conſenting to
wickednes did not diſpleaſe the
Lord thy Creator, this ſentence of
the Prophet Eſaie had neuer béen
vttered; Awaie with the euill and
wickednes of your thoughts from
my ſight. Againe in the Goſpell,
the Lord vſeth theſe words to the
Phariſies; why doo ye thinke euill
in your hearts? Neither would
the bleſſed Apoſtle S. Paule haue
ſpoken in this manner; Their
thoughts accusing or excuſing one
another, at the day when God ſhall
iudge the ſecrets of men, according
to my Goſpell.
                     Among manie vices, which Ieſus
the ſon of Sirach reciteth, exhorting
vs therwithall to be aſhamed
of them, he omitteth not looking
vpon another mans wife, vſing
manie trifling words with a
maiden, or ſtanding by hir bed-ſide;
becauſe they be as it were ladders
to clime vp to greater miſchiefs,
and therefore ought moſt aduiſedlie

to be ſhunned.
                     To knit vp my meaning in breuitie,
O man, I would haue thée
walke after the example of Chriſt
in holines and innocencie, not deluding
thine owne ſoule with anie
falſe and lieng perſuaſion of the
diuels ſuggeſting; as though it
were the actuall déed, which diſpleaſed
Gods maieſtie, and that
thy thoughts and cogitations are
not to be called to a reckoning.
                     I tell thée, O man, that as the
ſunne ouer-looketh all things with
his cléerenes; ſo the Lord ſéeth into
the verie ſecrets of thy heart. No
thought may eſcape him, no imagination
be hidden from him, no
word be vnknowne to him, neither
anie déed, though neuer ſo cloſelie
wrought, flie from before his face.
                     How then canſt thou deceiue him,
who will not be deceiued? Or how
dareſt thou conceiue, that thou haſt
ſhifts to ouer-ſhoote the Lord, before
whome thy heart and reines
ſtand ſtarke naked and diſcouered?

Beware therefore, O man, of inward
luſting; for euen therby thou
falleſt into the tranſgreſſion of the
lawe, and (if Gods mercie doo not
reforme thée) ſtandeſt in ſtate of
damnation.
                  
                  
                     3 A praier for the former
vertue.
                     O Almightie &amp; euerlaſting God,
we fall on our faces at the feet
of thy Maieſtie, before whom our
harts are as bright as glaſſe, ſo that
thou ſeeſt euen the ſmalleſt ſpot &amp;
ſtaine of the ſame, much more the
great blemiſhes, which are not to
be hidden; beſeeching thee, that
whereas we haue ſtarted like broken
bowes, from the fealtie whereto
we ſware; and haue moſt lewdlie
and looſelie followed the libertie
of our luſts, committing againſt
thee ſuch ſinne and iniquitie, as thy
bleſſed Apoſtle S. Paule admoniſhed
vs ought not once to bee named
among vs; to pardon that

is paſt, and to accept our preſent
humiliation and repentance, in token
of a full purpoſe to lead a godlie
and reformed life hereafter.
                     Which that we may the better
doo, for that of ourſelues we cannot
ſo much as conceiue one good
thought; much leſſe vtter one good
word, or exerciſe one good deed; we
craue at thy bountifull hands an vtter
rooting out and ſupplanting of
all concupiſcence in vs, wherby we
are drawne to ſinne, as it were with
cartropes, and intangled therein as
flies in a ſpiders cobweb. O kill all
vncleannes in vs, quench it quite,
put out the heate thereof vtterlie
by the working of thy ſpirit; that
being purged within from all polluſion
&amp; filthines, we may become
new creatures, addicted to the true
ſeruice of thee, and enamored with
the glorie of thy name.
                     Sowe in vs moſt plentifullie the
ſeed of a cleane hart, which may
foſter and cheriſh with the heate
therof godly &amp; Chriſtian thoughts,

holie &amp; honeſt affections, pure and
vndefiled conſultations, that the
fountaine and well-head of our nature
being void of vncleannes, all
the appurtenances of the ſame may
be cleane and vnſtained: remembring
the ſaieng of Chriſt our Sauiour,
that nothing defileth a man,
but that which breaketh out of a
man; meaning the hart, which is a
treaſurie of things good and bad.
This grace, and all other graces neceſſarie,
beſtowe vpon vs for thine
infinite mercie ſake, ô almightie
and euerlaſting God, Amen.

ſentence of the vice
inſuing.
                     TO loue this world is a double madnes;
first, bicauſe it is variable and
deceitfull: ſecondlie, bicauſe it is but the
place of our pilgrimage. This world paſſeth

awaie, and the glorie of the ſame dieth
in a moment: therefore to loue this
preſent world is a varitie of vanities.
this world &amp; the glory of the ſame, is like
a ſtar, which glittereth in the firmament,
and with a ſudden glanſe looſeth his light.
It is like a ſparke of fire, which is quicklie
quenched and turned to aſhes, and therefore
to loue this world, or the pomps
thereof, is a woonderfull follie.
                     Conſider thine owne ſtate, ô man, the
miſeries therevpon depending, and the
vncertaintie of thy beſt ioies, the ſhortnes
of thy life, and the vnknowne comming of
death: conſider theſe things well and
throughlie, ſo ſhalt thou ſoone ſee in what
a phrenſie he is that loueth the world. Tell
me, I praie thee ô man, what is become of
all the louers of this world that liued in
former ages? There is nothing left of them
but dust, aſhes, and woormes meate.
Weigh well what they haue beene, and
what they are, euen men as thou art. They
haue eaten and dronke, they haue laughed
and made merrie, they haue enioied all
the pleaſures of this world, they haue
ſpent their life-time in peace and hartseaſe,

but what is befallen them now?
                     Are they not gone to their long home,
euen their graue, in the verie twinkling
of an eie, waiting for a ſecond doome,
much more terrible by a thouſand degrees,
than this temporall iudgement, that
hath paſſed vpon them? What doth
vaine-glorie auaile, flitting ioies profit,
worldlie pompe warrant, fleſhlie pleaſure,
delight, deceitfull riches helpe, great kindred
comfort in ſuch a caſe; albeit theſe
are the ſpeciall things for whoſe ſake men
loue this preſent world? After laughing,
coms lamenting; after pleaſure, paine; after
proſperitie, miſerie, after delights, torments:
if not in this life, yet in the life to
come. And therefore what wiſe man would
loue the world, vnles he will needs be at
defiance with God, &amp; loſe his owne ſoule?
                  
                  
                     2 The ASSALT giuen by the
loue of this preſent
WORLD.
                     
                        
                           O
                         Man, caſt thy rouing
eies round about thée,
and take a view of this
preſent world, whereof

thou haſt the lordſhip &amp; dominion.
Looke before thée, behind thée, aboue
thée, beneath thée, to the right
hand, and to the left; and tell me in
truth and conſcience, if anie thing
can be more beautifull, more comelie,
more handſome, more louelie,
or more delectable, than that which
we ſée dailie before our face in this
life?
                     O how woonderfull is the glorie
of heauen, in the pleaſant aire, in
the light of the Sun, in the increaſing
&amp; diminiſhing of the Moone,
in the varietie, courſe, and order of
the ſtarres? O how comfortable
is the earth, with floures of the
field and garden, fruits of orchards,
pleaſantnes of medowes,
and freſh riuers, plentifulnes of
corne, and all kind of graine, fruitfull
vines garniſhed with leaues
and cluſters of grapes, woods caſting
coole ſhadowes from gréene
trées; ſundrie kinds of creatures
ſeruing thy vſe, as horſſes for riding,
kine for milking, hounds for

hunting, ſpaniels for hawking,
oxen for plowing, aſſes and mules
for burthen, harts and hinds of the
forreſt, pheaſants and peacocks,
goodlie birds to behold: houſes
hoong about with clothes of arras,
wrought roofes, painted walles
and ſeelings, iuorie beds, couerlets
of ſilke and néedle worke, ſhéetes of
the fineſt linnen, pillowes of the
ſofteſt downe: great choice of ſwéet
muſicke, vpon the organs, the regals,
the recorder, the virginals,
the timbrell, the citterne, the vials,
the cornets, the lute, the harpe, and
ſundrie ſorts of tunable inſtruments,
yéelding moſt heauenlie
harmonie: maruellous faire, beautifull,
gallant, and perſonable women,
hauing faces, forheads, and
eie-browes like gliſtering glaſſe,
eies and chéekes moſt comelie and
amorous, lips and chins deintie &amp;
delicate, noſes and tongues woorth
abundance of treaſure, neckes and
breaſts adorned with chaines and
ou
                           •
                        hes, wriſts and fingers decked

with bracelets and rings ſet about
with pearles and pretious ſtones,
beſides the ineſtimable pleaſures of
their neate and fine bodies?
                     I cannot reckon vp the rich ornaments,
and variable recreations
of this preſent world, which thou
enioieſt, O man, after thine owne
deſire, liuing like an Angell in the
middeſt of Paradiſe, or rather a
God in all felicitie and happines.
And therefore ſet thy heart at reſt
whiles thou art in the world: thou
haſt but a time, ſpend it in ſuch
manner as thou maiſt be comforted:
for if thou die, there is none of
thy pompe will followe thée, but
thou muſt leaue all behind thée.
                     This is the place where thou
muſt build, plant, ſet, ſowe, graffe,
mowe, reape, threſh, grinde, bake,
brew, cate, drinke, and make merrie;
which I would with thée dailie
to doo. For after this life, there
is none other to be looked for; and
how long thou ſhalt liue, thou
canſt not tell: according therefore

to the dominion &amp; lordſhip which
thou haſt ouer all creatures, command
them to ſerue thée euerie one
in their degrée, qualitie, and nature.
                     It is a gréefe to thée, O man, to
loſe that which thou loueſt. Haſt
thou a tewell of ineſtimable value,
and exquiſite workemanſhip? It
will gréeue thy heart to part from
it, either at thy fréends importunate
begging, or at thy foes rigorous
and violent wreſting. Haſt
thou a horſſe trained vp for thine
owne ſaddle and proper riding?
Thou wilt be loth to lend him,
leaſt he miſcarrie, and ſo thou ſuffer
loſſe.
                     If thy heart be ſo faſtened vpon
one priuate thing, as a iewell, a
horſſe, a ring, a dog (for ſometimes
thy fanſie will be fixed therevpon)
that it is a ſore vexation and anguiſh
of mind to be diſpoſſeſſed of
them, ſince they are thy ioie and delight;
then it ſtandeth with reaſon,
that the whole world, with all the
furniture of the ſame, being in thy

poſſeſſion, and winning thine inward
affections and outward ſenſes
vnto them, would vtterlie kill
and take thy life from thée, if thou
ſhouldeſt but a ſhort time be forced
to take triall of ſuch a crooked
chance.
                     And therefore loue the world,
and the pleaſures of the ſame; for
by them thou muſt be defended
from all miſfortunes. It is thy pauilion,
thy tent, thy taberuacle; and
it is that neceſſarie prouiſion,
wherewith thou art to be mainteined
in the ſtate of proſperitie.
                  
                  
                     3 A praier againſt the
former vice.
                     O Almightie God, the giuer of
all goodnes, from whome, as
from a full ſea, plentifull redemption
doth flowe and guſh out moſt
ſtreminglie; we beſeech thee to
bow downe thine eies, and to behold
vs thy children, liuing among
a viperous generation of atheiſts, epicures,

infidels, and I wot not what
workers of iniquitie, whoſe whole
delight is in this world, and the
tranſitorie vanities of the ſame: ô
giue vs grace to eſteeme of it, as it
deſerueth, yea ſo baſelie and homelie
to repute of it, as of verie dirt
and doong; if for none other cauſe
but onlie this, which is a cauſe of
cauſes; namelie, for that it is ſet vpon
miſchiefe and wickednes, giuen
to vnrighteouſnes and maliciouſnes;
but chieflie, for that it is at enmitie
and ſtrife with thee. Thine Apoſtle
Iames hath taught vs, that to
be in amitie and league with the
world, to loue it, to delight and take
pleaſure in it, is to be at defiance
with thee, ô Lord God almightie,
to hate thee, to contemne and deſpiſe
thee. And S. Iohn hath told vs,
that the world knoweth thee not,
nor the true light Chriſt Ieſus thy
ſonne, whome thou ſenteſt with ſauing
helth into the ſame, but perſecuted
the king of glorie, euen to the
ſhamefull death of the croſſe. Beſides

this, we knowe that it is accurſed
for our ſakes, ſince our parents
Adam &amp; Eue fell from the ſtate of
innocencie, and committed ſinne
through pride of mind, which is deliuered
and made ouer vnto vs by
tradition.
                     Moreouer, we are taught that the
faſhion, the beautie, the loue and
glorie of this world vaniſheth, and
all the pleaſures of the ſame periſh.
We haue learned that it is to bee
conſumed and burnt to aſhes with
fire, and that all the riches, treaſures,
pompe, pride, renowne, and
whatſoeuer elſe it containeth, ſhall
be conuerted and turned into nothing.
Alas then for pitie, that we,
whome thou, ô Lord, haſt crowned
with excellencie aboue all creatures,
ſhould reioice in a thing of
naught, ſhould dote and be fond ouer
a thing that ſhall be waſted in
the twinkling of an eie, ſhould ſet
our minds on that, which is curſſed
for ſin, which is a friend to iniquitie,
a foe to innocencie, and to conclude,

a flat enimie to God.
                     Out alas that we ſhould loue that
which hateth God and his ſonne
Chriſt, who in the tender bowels of
compaſſion, was content to be crucified
for the world, and yet had not
where in the world to laie his head.
O monſtrous vnkindnes of the
creature to the creator! ô vnnaturall
dealing! ô tiger like crueltie retalied
for ſuch lamblike lowlines!
Grant vs better grace, moſt mercifull
father, and ſuffer not ſathan to
caſt ſo thicke and darke a miſt of
blindnes before our eies, that therby
we ſhould be allured to loue the
world; but rather arme vs with faith
whereby wee may ouercome the
world, and triumph ouer the ſame
in victorie, through Ieſus Chriſt our
Lord, Amen.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     1 S. BARNARDS golden
ſentence of the vertue
following.
                     
                        THE contempt of this world, ô man,
if it were common, as it is but rare,

would be a meanes to drawe thee vnto
God, and to a longing fo the life to come.
Thine owne miſerable and helples estate
in this vale of wretchednes, were enough
to bring thee to an vtter miſliking and
deſpiſing of this world. For what art thou,
ô man? no more than a man, yea a bare
and naked man, a poore man, and a diſtreſſed
man: a man lamenting that thou
art a man, aſhamed that thou art borne a
naked man, repining that thou art borne
to labour, and not to honour: a man borne
of a woman, and through the guilt of ſin liuing
but a while, and therefore fraught
with feare, ſtuft with miſerie, and wrapped
in wo; yea, manie and manie woes,
woes of bodie, woes of mind, woes in ſleeping,
woes in waking, woes on all ſides,
which way ſoeuer thou lookeſt, and castest
thy tooting eies.
                     How then canſt thou find in thy hart, ô
man, to loue the world; and not rather to
hate and haue it in contempt, knowing
that it is the fornace where all theſe afflictions
are forged? Thou art one of Adams
ſonnes, deſcended of his loines, borne
in ſin, brought vp in wickednes; and therefore

thou canst not liue in this world
without labour, without ſorowe, without
anguiſh, without misfortune, and infinite
caſualties day by day ebbing and flowing,
wherevnto thou art ſo much the more
ſubiect, bicauſe thou loueſt the world,
which thou oughteſt to contemne, and vtterlie
miſlike. Againe, in louing the world,
thou art in league with ſin, and in fee with
death. Why then wilt thou loue the world?
why wilt thou deſire his friendſhip? why
wilt thou hunt after the delight of the
ſame? the longer thou liueſt in it, the greeuouſer
is thy tranſgreſſion, the heinouſer
thy wickednes, the more in number thine
offences. Loue this world the leſſe, and ſin
the leſſe: contemne this world the more,
and riſe to righteouſnes the more: for the
killing of the one, is the quickning of the
other. Set not thy mind, ô man, vpon this
preſent wicked world, nor the vaine pomps
and tranſitorie triſhtraſh of the ſame; for
it ſhall waxe old as a garment, and all the
beautifull brauerie thereof ſhall vade
like a bloſſome.
                     Looke aloft, ô man, to Ieruſalem the citie
of the great king, who will ſatisfie thee

with the fineſt floure of wheate, and cheriſh
thee with comfortable ſtreames of
running riuers. There is no meaſure nor
weight, there is no ſcale nor ballance, there
are no bounds nor marks; but plentie and
abundance, fulnes and ſtore, freedome and
libertie. There is no feare nor trembling,
becauſe God hath establiſhed peace in
his kingdome; no enimie entreth in, no
friend goeth out of that citie: there are
no temptations; there are no troubleſome
thoughts; becauſe he that is alwaies one,
and neuer changeth, hath ſet euerie thing
in a ſtedfaſt and inuariable order. There
is no power of tempting, no cauſe of diſquieting,
no ablenes of hurting, no dooing
againſt gods holie will, and no tranſgreſſing;
but happie peace, and peaceable
happines; perfect pleaſure, and pleaſant
perfectnes; one will in God and vs, ſo that
whatſoeuer pleaſeth him, the ſame pleaſeth
vs. There is cleere light, which wee
ſhall behold with cleere eies. There is the
ſouereigne good, euen the treaſure of treaſures,
which we ſhall not onlie ſee, but alſo
enioie, I meane life euerlasting, which is
the fulnes of time, the length of daies, yea,

the true daie, which knoweth no ſun ſetting,
the high noonetide, the abundance of
perfect glorie, euerlasting truth, and true
euerlastingnes.
                     The continuance of that citie hath no
end, the brightnes of that citie hath no
dimnes, no decaie. The fulnes of the ioies
of that citie hath no lothſomnes. O true
mid-daie, ô glistering light, ô cleere ſunſhine,
ô driuer awaie of darke ſhadowes, ô
drier vp of fens and mariſhes, ô cleanſer
of noiſomnes and ſtinkes! O temperate
ſpring-tide, ô beautifull ſummer, ô plentifull
harueſt, ô calme and quiet winter, ô
ſafe dwelling, paradiſe I meane: ô ſweete
food of life, God almightie! Long ô man
with a godlie longing after theſe euerlaſting
ioies laid vp in heauen, where
thou ſhalt ſee God face to face, who
is the light of the inlightened,
the reſt of the exerciſed, the
countrie of the ſore trauelled,
the life of the
liuing, and the
crowne of conquerors.
                  
                  
                     
                     2 The REPVLSE giuen by the
contempt of this preſent world,
and the loue of the world
to come.
                     
                        
                           O
                         Man, if the things
which thou ſéeſt vnder
heauen ſo much
delight thée; if a verie
priſon and gaile
ſeeme ſo beautifull in thine eies:
what affections ſhould the countrie
of countries, the citie of cities,
and manſion of manſions bréed in
thy heart? If ſtrangers and forreners
are in loue with ſuch vanties,
how pretious are thoſe things
which children &amp; heires ſhall poſſeſſe,
euen to their full cōtentment?
If mortall and miſerable men are
ſo inriched in this life, how ſhall
immortall and bleſſed ſaincts be
rewarded in the life to come?
                     Wherefore I counſell thée, O
man, to ſhake off from thée the loue
of this preſent world, wherein no
reaſonable creature is ſo borne,

that he ſhould not die, and take vnto
thée in place thereof the loue of
the world to come, where all are ſo
reuiued and quickened, that they
cannot die againe: where no aduerſitie
troubleth, no neceſſitie
pricketh, no moleſtation vexeth, but
eternall reioiſing reigneth.
                     But thou wilt aſke mée, what
elſe ſhould be there, but continuance
and euerlaſtingnes of ſuch
and ſo great bleſſednes? I can not
anſwere thée otherwiſe than thus,
that what good thing ſoeuer is,
there it is to be found: and what euill
thing ſoeuer is, there it is not
to be found.
                     Thou wilt yet aſke me further
what good thing that is? I tell
thée, O man, it is néedles to aſke.
The Prophet Eſaie, and the Apoſtle
Paule teach thée in few
words, ſaieng: The eie hath not
ſéene, the eare hath not heard, neither
hath it entred into the heart of
man, what things God hath prepared
for them that loue him.
                     
                        
Zelous Dauid, garded about
with all the glorie, pompe, and riches
of this preſent world, gaſped
and groned after this felicitie,
when he ſaid: What haue I in
heauen but thée? and there is nothing
vpon earth that I deſire in
compariſon of thée. God is the
ſtrength of my heart, and he is my
portion for euer. The ſame good
King Dauid, in the abundance of
his ſumptuous banketing diſhes,
and coſtlie fare,vſeth theſe words;
I will behold thy face in righteouſnes,
and when I awake, I
ſhall be ſatiſfied with thine image.
                     Againe, My ſoule thirſteth for
God, euen for the liuing God:
when ſhall I come and appeare before
the preſence of God? And yet
againe, How are the daies of my
pilgrimage prolonged? How long
ſhall I dwell on earth? But
Paule much better, I deſire to be
looſed, to be ſet at libertie, to die,
and to depart cut of this world,
that I may be with Chriſt.
                     
                        
By which godly mens examples,
written for thine inſtruction, O
man, that thou mighteſt increaſe
in knowledge, and expreſſe the
points of thy holie calling; I
would wiſh thée to be ſchooled, to
be wearie of this world, to loath
the vanities of the ſame, to eſtéeme
the pleaſures thereof as ſmoke,
which vaniſheth with the leaſt
blaſt of wind that doth blowe: to
repute of riches, honours, dignities,
offices, promotions, lands,
poſſeſſions, beautie, fauour, eloquence,
wiſedome, policie, ſtrength,
manhood, valiantnes, kindred, affinitie,
linage, petigrée, parentage,
and whatſoeuer elſe may be named
as they are; euen méere vanities,
according to the ſentence of the
preacher, who beheld and conſidered
all things vnder the ſunne, and
lo, all was vanitie, vanitie of vanities,
and nothing but vanitie.
                     The counſell of bleſſed Paule offereth
it ſelfe in conuenient place
to be imbraced, who no doubt had a

perfect view of the vanities reigning
in this world; vanitie in eating
and drinking, vanitie in ſpeaking
and thinking, vanitie in writing
and inuenting, vanitie in apparell
and clothing, vanitie in buieng
and ſelling; vanitie in heart,
vanitie in tongue, vanitie at home,
vanitie abroade, vanitie on ſea, vanitie
on land, vanitie in moſt, vanitie
in leaſt, vanitie in rich, vanitie
in poore, vanitie in wiſe, vanitie
in fooles, vanitie in ſtrong, vanitie
in weake, vanitie in faire, vanitie
in foule; finallie, nothing but vanitie
vanitie, which way ſoeuer a
man caſteth his eies, vp or downe,
on this ſide or that ſide, behind, before,
or round about.
                     And therefore S. Paule (I ſaie)
willeth vs (whoſe aduiſe I wiſh
thée O man to followe and put in
vre) that ſuch as wéepe, ſhould be
as though they wepe not; they
that reioice, as though they reioiced
not; they that buie, as though
they poſſeſſed not; and they that vſe

this world, as though they vſed it
not. And why ſo? For (ſaith he)
the faſhion of this world weareth
awaie, and all the pleaſures, recreations,
delights, and whatſoeuer
thing paſſeth other in excellencie,
is but méere vanitie.
                     Héere, O man, thou canſt doo no
good déed, but it hath an imperfection;
the diuell is ſo buſie about
thée to ouer-ſwaie thée in thy
works; yea, when thou art beſt occupied,
euen in praieng to God the
father for ſupplie of ſome-thing
which thou lackeſt, or praiſing him
for benefits and graces receiued,
or confeſſing thy faults when
thou haſt offended or ſuing for
pardon by the vertue of Chriſtes
death and paſſion. Wh

                         thou art

To conclude, when thou art
goodlieſt diſpoſed and giuen, then,
euen then the diuell ſendeth out his
angels, euen wicked thoughts, idle
imaginations, phantaſticall toies,
and a thouſand impediments, to
withdrawe thée not onlie from dooing
well, but alſo from thinking
well.
                     O man, this buſie diuell, who ſéeketh
to make a diuorce betwéene
Chriſt and thy ſoule, whome hée
hath married to himſelfe, and choſen
for his ſpouſe; he, euen he is the
prince of this world; he is the
prince of darkenes, and therefore
this world, which is his princedome,
muſt néeds be darkenes: for
whatſoeuer is at ſtrife with God,
who is the father of light, the ſame
is darkeneſ; but ſuch is the world,
therefore the ſequeale is prooued,
and ſtandeth iumpe with truth.
                     Now, O man, buckle thy ſelfe to
encounter with this world, the
pompe, pride, ſtatelines, and iollitie
thereof. Let faith, Dauids chiefe

weapon againſt Goliah, be thy
chiefe armour, let righteouſnes and
light be thy furniture, and not onlie
that, but the complet harnes which
S. Paule exhorteth the Epheſians
to put on; namelie, the vainbraces
of veritie girt about thy
loines, the breſt-plate of righteouſnes
claſpt cloſe to thy hart, the preparation
of the Goſpell of peace for
ſhooes on thy féet, the helmet of ſaluation
to couer thy head, the ſhield
of faith to hold in thy left hand, and
the ſword of the ſpirit in thy right.
                     Thus prepared, O man, feare
not the force of anie foe: for thou
ſhalt de able thus armed, to quench
all the firie darts of the wicked, to
ſtand faſt againſt ſathans aſſalts,
and the inuaſions of his miniſters.
Looke about thée, beſtir thée.▪ haue
an eie before, behind, aboue, belewe,
on thy right hand, on thy left, and
round about thée, that thou be not
betraied, ſupplanted, ouercome, and
ſubdued. Handle thy weapon circumſpectlie,
fight it out manfullie,

and giue not an inch of ground to
thine aduerſarie; for thou dooeſt not
wreſtle againſt fleſh and bloud onlie,
but againſt principalities, againſt
powers, and againſt worldlie
gouernours, the princes of the
darknes of this world, againſt ſpirituall
wickedneſſes, which are in
the high places.
                     Go to then in Gods name, ſet
forward in faith, Gods grace is
thy guide, feare not the world; for
Chriſt hath ouercome the world.
Thy life on earth, O man, is a continuall
warfare, thou ſhalt be in
one conflict or other, ſo long as
thou draweſt breath: and therefore
praie alwaies, with all manner of
praier and ſupplication in the ſpirit,
and watch therevnto with all
perſeuerance, ſo ſhalt thou be ſuccoured
at all aſſaieſ, and not
deſtitute of helpe in time of néed.
                     So fight therefore, O man, not
as one that beateth the aire; but as
one that would be counted a good
ſouldiour, and tread vnder féete the

loue of this world, withſtand euerie
thing that commeth not of
faith, for it is ſin: endure all, ſuffer
all, beare all, hazzard life and all
for the loue of the life to come, perſuading
thy ſelfe, that thou art
bleſſed (as S. Iames ſaith) when
thou ſubdueſt the temptations of
thy diſordered appetites, vrging
thée to ſin. For when thou art tried,
thou ſhalt receiue the crowne
of life, which the Lord hath promiſed
to them that loue him; the
crowne of glorie, euen an incorruptible
crowne, which ſhall be ſet vpon
thine head, at the appearing of
Ieſus Chriſt, the great and vniuerſall
ſhepheard of thy ſoule.
                     Feare none of thoſe things which
thou ſhalt ſuffer. Behold, it ſhall
come to paſſe, that thou ſhalt be tried
ten daies; that is, manie times:
be thou faithfull and wiſe vnto the
death, and thou ſhalt ſurelie be rewarded
with the crowne of eternall
life, promiſed by Ieſus Chriſt
thy ſauiour; to whome be all laud,

praiſe, honor and glorie, for euermore,
Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     3 A praier for the former
vertue.
                     O Eternall God, father of our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which by
the mouth of thine Apoſtle bleſſed
Iohn, haſt giuen vs this wholeſome
counſell and admonition; that we
ſhould not loue this corruptible
world, neither yet the things that
are in the ſame. And why? euen becauſe
the loue of God the father is
not in him that loueth this world.
For, ſaith thine Apoſtle, all that is
in the world; as the luſt of the fleſh,
which is to liue in pleaſure; the luſt
of the eies, which is wantonnes; and
the pride of life, which is ambition,
and haughtines, is not of the father,
but of the world, and therefore wicked
and damnable. In conſideration
whereof, ô almightie God, breed in
vs we beſeech thee, by the vertue of
regeneration, a hatred of this preſent

world, and a loue of the world
to come; that by how much we are
ſeparate and diſtant from the one,
by ſo much we may be knit and coupled
in neerenes to the other; wiſhing
rather by triall of manie tribulations
in this life, to arriue in
the end at the port of perpetuall
peace, and endles tranquilitie, than
by enioieng all this preſent worldes
goods, and the variable pleaſures of
the ſame, which are but momentanie,
to receiue eternall torments in
the lake of reſtles paine, and vnceſſant
miſerie.
                     Now therefore, moſt mercifull
father; for that we haue heere in
this world no continuing citie, but
looke for one to come; not of dutie
by deſerts in our ſelues, but of mercie
by the merits of thy ſonne: we
beſeech thee moſt earneſtlie to
weane vs from the loue of this
world; ô weane vs Lord, that wee
may be like children weaned from
their mothers teates, that as they
giuing ouer to ſucke milke anie

more, which is a food for ſucklings,
are fed with ſtronger nouriſhment,
as they growe in yeares: ſo we withdrawing
our ſelues from louing the
vaine toies, and vading ſmokes of
pleaſures attending on this life,
which are the ioies of worldlings,
may betake ourſelues to the meditation
of heauenlie bleſſednes, fall
in loue therwith, and long after life
euerlaſting dailie more and more,
the neerer we drawe to our graues.
                     For we doo beleeue, ô eternall
king, and vniuerſall emperour, that
the leaſt ioie in heauen, if it might
be peiſed in a paire of ſcales, would
weigh downe all worldlie delights
by thouſand thouſands; yea, though
they had the vantage of the balance:
and therefore no doubt they
are exceeding great, woonderfull,
&amp; out of meaſure; yea ſuch, as no eie
could euer atteine to ſee, no eare
be able to heare, no hart conceiue
or vnderſtand, and no tongue vtter
or declare. Then Lord, of thy woonted
goodnes, giue vs grace to hate

this preſent world, with all the
pomps and vanities of the ſame;
that we may loue the world which
ſhall euer laſt, euen heauen, the
houſe of thee, ô thou moſt high
God; and may dailie and hourelie
grone and braie after it, praieng
continuallie for the time, when it
ſhall be reuealed, and ſaieng with
feruencie of ſpirit; Thy kingdome
come Lord, thy kingdome come,
for the conſolation of the elect, and
the confuſion of the reprobate.
                     Come Lord Ieſu, come quicklie, &amp;
make no tarrieng; that the ioies of
the faithfull may be fulfilled. O
heare our praiers, moſt holie,
bleſſed, and glorious Trinitie,
Father, Sonne, and
holie Ghoſt, one God in
vnitie; to whom be all
praiſe, power and
maieſtie, Amen.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
            
            ¶The winding vp of this worke,
conteining a briefe concluſion vpon
this theame; That victorie is obteined
by reſiſting temptations. Drawne
out of S. Barnard, and engliſhed for
the agreement of the matter
compriſed in this
booke.
            
               WE beare about vs our
owne ſnare, wee carrie
with vs to and fro in euerie
place our owne enimie,
I meane this fleſh
ingendered and bred of ſinne, nourſhed
and foſtered in follie, corrupted
and defiled with lewd and wicked
cuſtome. The moſt ſubtill ſerpent
vſeth this fleſh to ouerſwaie vs, hauing
none other deſire, none other
meaning, none other purpoſe, none
other endeuour, none other buſines
whereabout to be occupied, but to
ſhed the bloud of ſoules. This is he
that alwaies intendeth miſchiefe againſt
vs. In our muſings he talketh
with vs wittilie, he eggeth vs
cunninglie, and deceiueth vs craftilie:
he ſetteth venemous thoughts
on fire in our harts, he ſtirreth vp
ſtrife, maintaineth hatred, allureth
to gluttonie, prouoketh to lecherie,

ſpurreth forward to the luſt of the
fleſh, prouideth occaſions of ſin, and
ceaſeth not to tempt mens harts
with a thouſand miſchieuous wiles,
and dangerous deuiſes.
            This is hee, which bindeth our
hands with our owne girdles; that
the fleſh, which is giuen vnto vs for
an helpe and ſuccour, might be made
a ſnare to intrap vs, and a downefall
to breake our necks. But in vs it lieth,
if we will be vanquiſhed, if we
will be ouercome: and neuer a one
of vs ſhall be ouerthrowne in this
combat againſt our will. Thine own
concupiſcence, O man; thine owne
luſt, I ſaie, is ſubiect vnto thee, and
thou maiſt, if thou wilt, ouer-rule it
with reaſon. Thine aduerſarie may
kindle the fire of temptation, but it
is in thine owne choice to blowe the
cole of conſent; that is, either to yeeld
therevnto or to withſtand it.
            It is in thine owne power, &amp; thou
maiſt, if thou wilt, make thine enimie
thy ſeruant, thine aduerſarie thy
vaſſall, thy fo thy drudge; that all
things may be done for the beſt in
thy behalfe. For so, the enimie kindeleth
in thee a deſire of meate: he
caſteth into thy mind thoughts of
vanitie and vnpatience: he ſtirreth
vp in thee a tickling and itching of

luſt: onelie giue not thy conſent to
ſuch remptations: and how often
thou doeſt gaine-ſtand them, ſo often
thou ſhalt be crowned.
            I do beleeue all this verelie, if we
haue the grace quicklie to perceiue
theſe thoughts in our hearts, and
ſuffer them not to tarrie long with
vs; but haue our mind moued with a
vehement ſpirit againſt them. For
then our enimie ſhall depart quite
confounded, and ſhall not ſo willinglie
returne to aſſalt vs againe. Neither
muſt we yeeld, giue ouer, or
ſhrinke any whit, albeit the greeuous
rage, and extreame heate of temptations
afflict and trouble the ſtate of
our outward and inward man: let vs
rather chooſe to burne than to turne,
to ſmart than to yeeld.
            The diuell is well knowne to repine
at the temporall and ſpirituall
proſperitie of mankind; he doth what
he can to defraud him of both felicities;
namelie, of heauenlie and earthlie,
but a great deale more of the dew
of heauen, than of the fatnes of the
earth. Heereof we ought at no hand
to be ignorant, to wit, what a rebellious
troop of enimies come downe
vpon vs forceablie; whome it behoueth
vs ſo much the more diligentlie
and carefullie to withſtand, by how

much wee ſee our ſelues mooued
therevnto by great need; and then to
laie on loade, when all the weight of
warre preſſeth vpon vs, when the
whole ſtrife is come to handblowes,
whereby the conquered get ſhamefull
captiuitie, and the conquerours
gain triumphant glorie and victorie.
            For the diuell is knowne to grudge
at our good eſtate, &amp; pininglie to haue
ſpite at our heauenlie happines;
howbeit, not for his owne ſake, that
he himſelfe might enioie it, becauſe
he loſt it without recouerie: but for
the poore ſoules ſake, raiſed out of
the duſt and dunghill, that he might
not approch and come to the poſſeſſion
of that place, from whence the
diuell himſelfe, being created in glorie,
fell ſhamefullie, paſt hope of riſing
againe. Heereat hee grudgeth
moſt maliciouſlie, and taketh on too
too vnpatientlie, that mans frailtie
ſhould get that which it deſerued not
to haue.
            And if peraduenture he go about to
procure ſome bodies loſſe of temporall
things, or hauing procured it, do
reioice and triumph thereat; this the
diuels doing tendeth wholie to this
point, that the outward loſſe might
be an occaſion of the inward. For all
this wreſtling and fighting againſt

vs, is of ſpirituall wickedneſſes, that
they may ſeduce or miſleade vs, that
they may bring vs into their owne
waies, that they may conduct and
guide vs to the purpoſed and appointed
end, which is prepared for
themſelues; namelie, to hell and vtter
damnation.
            It is the diuels drift to aſſault vs
with euill temptations, to egge vs to
the committing of ſin; it is our duties
not to conſent therevnto, not to
yeeld to the woorking of wickednes.
For how often as wee gaine-ſtand
the diuell, ſo often we ouercome him,
ſo often we make the angels of heauen
to reioice, ſo often we doo God
our Lord honourable ſeruice. For it
is his will and commandement, that
we ſhould fight manfullie; he helpeth
vs, that wee may get the vpper
hand, he ouer-looketh vs fighting,
he ſuccoureth vs fainting,
he crowneth vs ouercomming.
To him therfore
be all honor and
glory, world without
end, Amen.
