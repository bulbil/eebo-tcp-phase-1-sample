            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            To the Reader.
            
               BEsides what hath bin added to this Booke, which is apparent, you shal find two faults especialie amended by this impression. One is the confusion of number. For in a praier sometime the person of one, sometime of many praieng was vsed: which thing, in my iudgement, caused some iar. For the auoiding whereof I haue thought it best to amend that fault, and, I trust with the good liking both of the Autor, and as manie as shal reade them, henceforth to vse altogether the plural number in those praiers which are for euery daie of the weeke: albeit the rest are in the singular number, forasmuch as they are praiers for some special persons.
            The other is the difficultie properlie to applie diuers of those textes of scripture placed in the margins. For manie times the places of Scripture were falselie quoted. But now, how soeuer the Compositor haue set them, if you marke the letters of the Alphabet a, b, c, d, &amp;c. vsed both in euerie praier, and margin, they wil rightlie direct thee to the textes.
            Other things besides these are amended, which are needeles to be vttered in this place.
            Some perhaps wil mislike the applieng of praiers vnto certaine daies: but for that a better some doe both like wel enough thereof, and laude God for this dailie exercise of their faith prescribed; and also because it is not done (as againe in the table to this booke I protest) to tie thee superstitiouslie to our order, I haue nothing varied from the former and first impression in that point, doubting not but thou canst, and wilt vse this booke to thy profit, and be thankeful, Farewel.

               THAT THE world was made for man, euen Lactantius de diuino praemio. cap. 4. Cicero lib, 2 de Natura Deorum. Philosophers, through the instinct of humane reason coulde, and the carnal worldlinges through the often hearing of Gods holy worde can confesse: that man is created for God Gene. 1, 6. Psalme. 8, 6. me thinks there should be none so barbarouslie ignorant, orCauses why daily praier is necessary. in this cleere light of the glorious Gospel, so desperatelie secure,



as to doubt. A notable cause,1. From the end of mans creation. were there no mo but that, why dailie, and euermore we shoulde extol, and with diuine praises, celebrate the most sacred Name of almightie God: but manie waies besides are we bounde to doe the same. For consider wee, either the commandements of God; or his benefits; or the frailenes of our corrupt nature; or Satans snares; or the miseries aswel publike as priuate; or our couenant made with God in baptisme; or the vncertaintie of the daie either of our death or general iudgment, and we shal finde that the least of these things offereth sufficient occasion continuallie to praie, and to praise God.
            For touching the commandements,2. From the commandementes of God. God saith, by the Prophet Dauid, Psa. 50, 15. 
               Cal vpon me in the time of trouble, so wil I heare thee, and thou shalt praise me; by his Sonne our Sauiour, Mark. 13, verse, 33. 
               Watch and praie; by Saint Paule the Apostle, Colos. 4, 2. 
               Continue in praier, and watch in the same with thankesgiuing. Yea, not3. From the promise of God to here our petitiōs onlie he commaundeth so to doe,



which prooueth the excellencie of the exercise, but also promiseth to heare our petitions, which declareth how surpassinglie sweete, are deuout Meditations, in the eares of God. As in that afore mentioned Psalme of Dauid, Cal vpon me, &amp;c. Againe, Luk. 11, 9. 
               Seeke and ye shal finde, knocke, and it shal be opened vnto you: and againe for al, Iohn. 16, verse, 23. 
               Whatsoeuer yee shal aske the Father in my name, he wil giue it you.
            
            His benefits are for nomber infinite,4. From the greatnes of Gods benefites. for greatnes wonderful, excellent for their worthines, whether we respect the gifts of the minde or the goods of the bodie, spiritual or corporal, bestowed vpon some particularlie, or generalie vpon al men. Who can declare the goodnes of God (that I may ouerpasse the temporal benefits, either common to vs with al men, or specialie bestowed vpon vs before al) who can I saie, declare the goodnes of God sufficientlie for creating vs Gen. 1, 26. Colos. 3, 10. after his owne image; for reuealing himselfe vnto vs; for redeming vs 1. Pet. 1, 19 Heb. 9, 14. by his deare Sonne; for choosing vs



before the foundations of the world were laide; for enduing vs with his holie spirit; and for exalting vs to eternal life? What therfore shal we render vnto the Lord for al these things? Psal. 116, ver. 12. &amp;c. 
               Let vs take vp the cup of saluation, and celebrate the name of our God.
            
            If we consider the frailenes of5. From the weaknes of our nature. our nature we shal find, that continualie we are subiect to sinning, to offending, to erring, &amp; to conceauing amisse of the wil of our God to our certaine condemnation. Bernarde serm. 7, de aduentu Domini. 
               There is none of vs al which standeth not in neede of counsaile, of props, and of helpe. The general miserie of mankind is triple, &amp;c. For both we are easie to be seduced, and vnable to doe wel, and weake to resist. If we would discerne betwene good and euil, we are deceaued; if we go about to doe good, we quicklie faint; If we endeuour to resist euil, we cannot endure, but are easilie ouercome. The consideration of this frailetie of ours, made our Sauior Christ graciouslie to admonish his Disciples, saieng, Matt. 26. verse, 41. 
               Watch and praie, least ye enter into tentation.
            
            
               Againe, the tyrannie and rage of6. From the fury &amp; rage of Satan. the diuel is vnspeakeable, and his power mightie, being the Prince Ephe. 2, 2. Iohn. 12, 31. of this worlde. We wrestle not 
               Ephes. 6, verse. 12. 
               against blood and flesh, but against rule, against powers, against worldlie gouernors of the darkenes of this worlde, against spiritual wickednes in heauenly places. It behooueth vs therefore, according to the counsaile of Saint Peter, 1. Pet. 5, 8. to watch and praie. For our aduersarie the Diuel, as a roaring Lion, rangeth about seeking whome he may deuoure. But Gaudentius Merula de memorabilibus, lib. 2, cap. 9. as the Lion at the sight of a Cocke is discomforted, and at his crowing betaketh him to his heeles: so doth Satan both stande in feare of a godlie man, and flie at his praier. As Lactantius noteth, Lactantius de Origine erroris▪ cap. 16. 
               Diuels doe hurt but the faint harted, such as the great and mightie hande of God doth not protect, which are prophane from the Sacrament of truth, but the iust, that is, the true worshippers of God, doe the Diuels feare.
            
            What should I speake of the tyrannie7. Frō the miseries both priuate and publike. of mightie men; of the miserie of poore; how wickednes doth abound, and heresies ouerflowe? Wherefore wel may I say, as did Nestor vnto hisNestor. children, Praie, for vnles that God helpe


               
               vs we al perish.
            
            Furthermore our couenant made8. From our couenaunt made with God at our Baptisme. with God at our Baptisme, whereby we promised to forsake the Diuel &amp; al his workes, &amp;c. to beleeue al the articles of the Christian faith; and to keepe Gods holie wil and commandement, &amp;c. shoulde driue vs therevnto. For neither can Satan be resisted;9. From the vncertaine time of the daie either of our deth, or iudgmēt. nor our faith manifested; nor GOD duelie honored without praier.
            Finallie, omitting al other reasons, which are infinite, the shortnes of our life, the suddaines of Christes comming, his seuerenes in iudgement when he is come, should make vs not slightlie to ouerpasse this noble exercise. For what auaileth it, though in this worlde Mat. 16, 26. we abounde in wealth, excel in honor, haue al thinges according to our harts desire, and then when Christ shal returne we are founde vnreadie, and so lose our soules? Happie therefore 
               Matt. 24, verse. 46. 
               is that seruant whome the Lorde at his comming shal find watchfull: and 
               Matt. 25, verse. 4. 
               happie are those Virgins which expect the bridegroome with oyle in their lamps. But that euil seruant Matth. 24, verse. 48. Luk. 12, 45. which shal saie



in his hart, my Lorde wil long be a comming, and so begin to smite his fellowes, yea, and to eate and drinke with the dronken, his Lord wil come in a daie, when he looketh not for him, and in an houre when he is not aware of, and shal hew him in peeces, and giue him his portion with hypocrites, there shal be weeping and gnashing of teeth; and those virgins which are careles and secure Matt. 25, vers. 10, &amp;c., accompanie not the bridegroome to his wedding, but are excluded out of the gates, and heare, I knowe yee not.
            
            The waightines of these reasons,The occasion of publishing this Booke. Honorable, haue especialie mooued me, through the earnest request of some which for their godlie zeale I loue vnfainedly, and reuerence, did greatlie prick me forwarde, to bring these diuine Meditations (I cal them diuine, partlie because they are of diuine matters, &amp; concerne the glorie of God; partlie for that they procede from a diuine spirit; but in this respect chiefly, because they are wholy, as fewe or no other praier Booke is that I knowe, taken out of the pure fountaines of the diuine Scriptures)



of the right learned and vertuous of famous memorie Maister Iohn Auenar, into our English tongue. A booke certes most necessarie in respect of the extreeme securitie wherein we liue. Gratefullie it hath bin accepted hetherto in the Latine and Germane tongues; and now by the workingHow he muste be qualified y• in praieng wold please God, &amp; vse this Booke to his profite. of Gods holie spirit, shal profite verie much, if it be vsed as it should be, that is, if the vser thereof praie, Religiouslie in faith; charitablie being voide of rancor and malice; zealouslie with an ardent affection of the minde; and humbly without pride.
            
            1 Faith is necessarie. For Heb. 11, 6. 
               without
               1. Faith. 
               faith it is impossible to please God. Therfore onely the faithful doe praie. For Rom. 10, verse. 14▪
                
               how can men cal vpon him in whome they haue not beleeued? 
               Rom. 14, verse. 23. 
               It is sinne whatsoeuer is not done through faith. Therefore the praier of infidels is no praier but hypocrisie, and a damnable abuse of good words; neither can it obtaine any thing at the handes of God, according to that of Saint Iames, Iames. 1, verse. 7. 
               He which wauereth let him not thinke that he can obtaine any thing from God.
            
            2 Charitie is necessarie. For we must2. Charitie.


               
               Iames. 5, verse. 16. 
               praie one for another; and for our enimies, Matth. 6, verse. 14. Matth. 5, 44▪ Mark. 11, 25 Luk. 23, 34. as our Sauior doth counsaile vs, saieng, When ye stande praieng, forgiue, if yee haue ought against any man, that your Father also which is in Heauen, may forgiue you your trespasses, &amp;c, Againe the spirite of God saith, Eccle. 28, verse 3, &amp;c. 
               Forgiue thy neighbor the hurt that he hath done thee, and so shal thy sinnes be forgiuen thee also when thou praiest. A man that beareth hatred against another, how dare he aske forgiuenes of God. He that sheweth no mercie to a man which is like himselfe, how dare he aske forgiuenes of his sinnes? &amp;c. and for al men, as may appeare 1. Tim. 2, 8 in the first Epistle of Saint Paule vnto Timothie.
            3 Zeale is necessarie. For what is3. Zeale. praier without the same, but a verie babling, and vaine multiplication of words? yea there is no praier, where this affection is not. For praier is aPrayer what; vehement desire of the hart to obtaine something at the hands of God. God loketh not vpon the face as man doth, but beholdeth the hart; neither doth he listen to the sounde of the mouth, but to the sighes of the minde. After this manner doe Christians praie, their affections are bent



towardes God, they alwaies Matt. 5, 6. hunger and thirst after righteousnes.
            4. Humilitie is necessarie. For vpon
               4. Humility. 
               whome shal my spirite abide, saith the Lord, Esai. 66, 2. 
               but vpon him which is of a lowlie spirite? The praier of him which humbleth himselfe Eccle. 35, verse 17. goeth through the clowdes. Much better is it for a sinner, to be humble, than for a righteous man to be arrogant, as may appeare in the Pharisie &amp; Publicane Luk. 18, 10..
            It remaineth now, that, as the Auctor of this Booke choase for patrone thereof, not for any defence that it needed, but because others the more willinglie woulde reade and accept the same, being dedicated vnto an honorable person gratious in the eies both of the Nobilitie and baser sort, the mightie Prince, Lorde Augustus, Duke of Saxonie, &amp;c. so mooued thervnto by the singular fame of your honors most virtuous inclination, I present the same now translated (for what other paines I haue taken I spare vpon good considerations, to vtter) vnto your honor, beseeching you to accept this my doing in good part, as my hope is you wil: and then I doubt not, being graciously receaued

            ¶ A Preface of Maister Iohn Auenar, Doctor of Diuinitie, and Publike Professor of the Hebrue tongue in the Vniuersitie of Witeberge, taken out of his Epistle before his Booke of daily Praiers, dedicated to the most mightie Prince, and Duke, Augustus, High marshal of the Romane Empire, &amp;c.
            
            
               THe chosen vessel of God, Saint Paule in his former Epistle vnto Timothie, doth exhort, 1. Timo. 2, verse. 1. &amp;c. that first of al, deprecations, supplications, intercessions, and giuing of thankes be made for al men: For Kings, and for al that are in auctoritie, that we may leade a quiet and peaceable life, in al godlines and honestie. Likewise vnto the Philippians he saith Philip. 4. verse. 6., be careful for nothing but in al things let your petition be manifest vnto God in praier



and supplication, with giuing of thankes.
            By which words we are not onelyKindes of praier. pricked forward vnto the Godly exercise of praier, but admonished besides, that there be foure kinds therof, al necessary to be vsed euery day. The first are Deprecations, whereby1. Deprecations what; we beg at the hands of Almightie God, either altogither to turne away his heauie displeasure conceaued through our sinnes, or at the least to mitigate the punishments due for our offences. Supplications2 Supplications what; are called requestes, wherby we craue such things as are necessarie either for the sustentation of this present life, or for our euerlasting comfort in the worlde to come. Intercessions3. Intercessions what; are praiers made in the behalfe of others. By thankesgiuing we praise4. Thankesgiuing what; God, and celebrate his holie name for al benefites conferred both vpon our soules and bodies.
            
               In this my Booke I haue had specialTh'order of this Booke. regarde vnto these foure kinds of praier. For first, for euery day of1 the weeke I haue made a morning praier, containing both a thankesgiuing for the blessed rest receaued, and a deprecation for the escaping of al euils which may happen in the day time. Afterwarde followeth a2▪
                thankesgiuing for some singular benefite receaued. Then two supplications3, 4. or petitions, for blessinges aswel eternal as temporal. Next vnto5, 6. them are placed two intercessions for men of euerie state or degree. After them ensueth a praier against7 the sondrie enimies of Christs Church. And last of al, an euening8 praier, containing a thankesgiuing vnto God for his preseruing of vs in the day time, a deprecation that no euil hurt vs in the night, and a petition of his fatherlie protection, is annexed.
            
               And this manner I haue obseruedDaily praier is inioined vs. in distinguishing the praiers for euerie day. For it is our partes daily in al our necessities to cry vnto God, as our Sauior teacheth to this purpose, Luk. 18, 1. Praie alwaies, &amp; be not wearie, And Saint Paule willeth the same, saieng, Praie 1. Thes. 5, verse. 17. continually, in al things giuing thanks. For this is the wil of God through Iesu Christ toward you. Againe, Eccles. 18, verse. 21. be not let to praie alwaies, and be not let vnto the death to exercise thy selfe in righteousnes. Thus did the kingly prophet Dauid, which of himselfe saieth, Psal. 119, verse. 164. seauen times a day doe I praise thee, because of thy righteous iudgements.
            And certes it is a goodly worke toA noble exercise to praie. cal vpon God in praier, and to enioy his familiar speech: The which also Saint Ambrose witnesseth, saieng,Ambrose. To praie much and often is a worke grateful to God. Howe excellent a



thing it is for man to interminglePraier ioyneth vs to the blessed company of the Angels in heauen. his talke with God, no man is ignorant, and that excellencie is attained by praier onely, which ioineth vs to the societie of Angels, through ascribing due praise and glorie vnto Almighty God, as their office doth binde them. Hence doth the Psalmist say: Psal. 138. verse. 1. In the sight of Angels wil

                sing praise vnto thee, I wil worship toward thy holy temple, and extol thy name. For in otherTo praie, &amp; to praise God, a thing common to men with Angels. things there is much difference betweene their condition and ours, whether we respect their nature, or their kinde of life; their wisedome, or their vnderstanding, but to praie is a worke common both to Angels and men. For praier doth seperate vs from brute beastes, and associate vs with Angels, Yea, an easie matter is it, for one to attaine to their nature, dignitie, wisedome, and vnderstanding, if al his life time, he giue

For if they which frequent the companie of wise men, by reason of their continual meetings, in short space are so changed, that they represent the wisedome of such as they company withal: what shal we saie of them which dailie talke with God in praier? Wherefore it behooueth vs, obeieng the wil of our Heauenlie Father, to spende our life time in the lauding of God, and in deuout meditations. But he which neither wil praie, norThe state of him which vseth not to praie. praise God, neither yet delight in this diuine communication, surelie liuing he is dead without life, without

            The frute and profite coming byThe frute and profit of faithful praier. godly praiers doth Saint Iames expresse on this manner: The praier of faith Iam. 5, 15. shal saue the sicke, and the Lord shal raise him vp, and if he



haue committed sinnes they shal be forgiuen him, &amp;c. Againe, Iames. 5, vers. 16. &amp;c. The feruent praier, of a righteous man auaileth much, Elias was a man vnder1. Kings. 17. verse. 1. Eccle, 48, 1. Luke. 4, 25. infirmities, euen as we are, and he praied in his praier that it might not raine, and it rained not on the earth, by the space of three yeres and sixe moneths. And he praied againe, and the heauen gaue raine, &amp; the earth brought forth hir frute.
            By these words it appeareth thatThe force of faithful praier. the praier of faith can obtaine, and bring to passe al things, belonging either to the safetie of the bodie, or saluatiō of the soule. As 1. Sam. 30, verse. 4. 2. Sam. 5, 19 that king and Prophet Dauid by praier repelled the horrible crewe of his mortal enimies. So in like maner 4. kings. 19 verse. 15. Ezechias the King of Iuda, Ierusalem being besieged by Sennacherib King of2. Chro. 32, verse. 20. the Assirians, gathered not a company of soldiours, but onely went againstEccles. 48, verse. 20. his enimies in praier, preuailed



against them, and preserued the2. Kings. 20 vers. 3, &amp; 5. Esaie. 38, vers. 2, &amp; 5. 2. Chro. 32, verse. 24. Cittie with the vtter ouerthrow of his aduersaries: Likewise by his humble praier he escaped death, and faithful supplication prolonged his daies. This made Saint Augustine to saie, Augustin. Nothing should dismaie a christian from praieng vnto God. The praier of the righteous is the keie of heauen, The praier of the godlie doth ascende, and the mercie of God doth come downe.
            So that knowing the dignitie ofThough of our selues we are vnworthie to open our mouthes in the presēce of God▪ yet through the grace of Gods holie Spirite, wee are emboldened so to doe. this familiar talke with God, and considering the commoditie which cometh thereby, me thinkes nothing should dismay a Christian from calling vpon God. For notwithstanding it exceede the power of man to reason with God: yet doth the holy spirit dwelling in the faithful helpe our weakenes, and not onely emboldeneth vs to approche before his Maiestie, but also maketh intercession for vs Rom. 8, verse. 26. with groanes vnspeakeable. As we reade that women



being of nature weake vessels, oftentimes by praier haue apprehended God, &amp; detained him, Matt. 15, vers. 22. &amp;c. as may appere in the woman of Canaan.
            Finally so many occasions areThe necessitie of dailie and continual praier. there to mooue, and stir vs daily vnto praier, that sufficiently they cannot be expressed. And if at anyOther causes mouing vnto praier you shal finde in the Epistle dedicatorie. time often praier were needeful, I perswade my selfe, that nowe in this last and olde age of this doting worlde, wherein as more grieuous and wofull wickednes doth raigne than at any time: so it is to be feared that in the Church more horrible punishments, and in common weales more miserable confusion wil ensue, than euer did, it should be practised; which euils can by no other meanes be auoided, but onely by dailie, earnest, and faithfull praier.
            The fountaine of al true wisedome and learning God almightie, continue among vs for his Sonnes



sake the puritie of his worde together with the studie of good letters, maintaine peace and concorde in his Church, and make vs al continually to addict our selues to aduance his glorie both in deede and worde, and to benefite his Church to the vttermost of our power, that liuing alwaies in his feare, we may die in his fauor, and rise againe to euerlasting blessednes.
            Amen.

               So shal quietnes and peace abound among vs like the hillockes on the earth.

                  O Almightie and merciful God, eternal Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost, three in persons, one in substance, God in verie deede and from euerlasting:
               We extol thy sacred Maiestie, we praise thine vnspeakeable mercie, thy diuine truth we exceedingly comend, for that of thy fatherlie and wonderful goodnes, thou hast protected vs this night vnder the shadowPsal. 17, 8. of thy wings: yea, thou also hast made vs quietlie to take our rest notwithstanding the dangerous snares of our deadlie enimie the diuel.
               Thou art the GodPsal. 9, 13., which exaltest vs from the gates of the shadowe of death; and from the power of darknes thou deliuerest vs.
               ThereforePsa. 107, 8. we wil acknowledge thee for thy goodnes, &amp; for the wonderful things which thou dost among the sonnes of men.
               We wil magnifie thee in the great CongregationPsal. 35, 18, and among much



people wil we praise thee.
               Our harts be readie, Psal. 57, 7.O our God, our harts be readie: We wil praise theePsa. 57, 9. Psal. 108, 3., O Lord, among the people, &amp; sing to thee among the nations. ForPs. 108, 4. thy mercie is great aboue the heauens, and thy truth vnto the cloudes.
               We wil not hidePsal. 40, 10 thy mercie and truth in the great Congregation; BecausePsal. 92, 1. it is a good thing to praise the Lorde, and to sing to thee, O thou most High, To declare thy louing2. kindnes in the morning, &amp; thy truth in the night.
               Blesse the Lord, O our soules, Psa. 103, 1.and al that is within vs praise his holie Name:
               Which forgiueth al our iniquities,3. and healeth al our infirmities:
               Which redeemeth our liues from4. destruction, and crowneth vs with mercie and compassion:
               Which satisfieth our longing with5. good things, and protecteth vs from our youth:
               Which alsoPsa. 34, 20 hath kept al our bones this night, Not one of them is broken.
               To thee1. Tim. 1, verse. 17. King euerlasting, immortal inuisible, &amp; onely, wise God, be honor, and glory for euer &amp; euer, Amen.
               
                  Vnto thee Psal. 25, 1., O Lord, doe we lift vp our soules.
               O God Psal. 63, 1. earelie wil we seeke thee; our soules thirst for thee, our flesh lusteth after thee in a barren &amp; drie lande, where no water is, to see thy strength and glorie.
               O eternal God which hast brought vs to the beginning of this daie, defend vs with thy mightie power, that this day we fal into no sinne, but let al our cogitations, wordes and workes, tende to the setting forth of thy righteousnes.
               Lighten our minds this morning with the shining and clearenes of thy wisedome, that in our harts, that true day star 2. Pet. 1, 19 may rise &amp; shine, as it were a candle burning in a darke place.
               Giue vs thy Spirit of wisdome Eph. 1, 17. and reuelation in the knowledge of thee, And Eph. 1, 18. lighten the eies of our vnderstanding, that we may know what our hope is, how great the glorie of our inheritance, and Psa. 18, 19. what the excelent greatnes of thy power toward vs.
               Fil vs Psa. 90, 14. with thy mercy in the morning so shal we be glad and reioice al our life long.
               Merciful God, endue vs with thine



holie Spirit, that we may neither thinke, speake, or doe anie thing this day, but that which may please thee, and tend to the aduancement of thy glorie, and health of our soules.
               Gouerne thou our vnderstanding and wil, and so direct al the cogitations of our hart, that we may wholie be thine, and sauor of nothing besides thee our God and Redeemer.
               Teach vs the waie of thy Commandements, Psa. 119, 33 O Lord, and we wil keepe it vnto the ende. Giue vs vnderstanding Ps. 119, 34. to keepe thy lawes, and to loue thee Deut. 6, 5. Matt. 22, 37. Luk. 10, 27. our Lord &amp; God with al our hart, with al our soule, and with al our strength: and let al thy restimonies Psal. 119, verse. 24. be our delight and Counselers.
               Comfort the soules Psal. 86, 4. of thy seruants, for vnto thee, O Lord, haue we lifted vp our soules. For thou Lorde Psa. 86, 5. art good and gentle, and of great kindnes to as many as cal vpon thee.
               Behold God, earelie now this Morning we doe offer our selues a Morning sacrifice vnto thee, a trobled spirit Psa. 51, 17. a broken and an humble hart, O Lorde thou wilt not despise.
               Make vs fit, that we may likewise

                  We see the workmanship of thine Psalm. 8, 3. hands, the Moone and Stars, which thou hast ordained; and we wil signifie thy glorie Psal. 96, 3. vnto al nations, and among al people wil we declare thy wonderful things. For thou art mightieEcc. 43, 29,4. O Lord, and worthie to be praised, great is thy virtue, and thy power wonderful.
               We thanke thee, holie Father, God of heauen, because thou hast created by thy worde of power the vniuersal worlde Genes. 1, verse 1. &amp;c. Hebru. 1, 2. Psalm. 104, verse. 1, &amp;c. with al the creatures, and whatsoeuer is, liueth, or mooueth in the same. By thy wisedome thou doest gouerne, and by sending of thy Spirit, as yet doest vpholde, and cherish the same.
               For al woods Gen. 1, 11. Psalme. 104. verse. 14. 15., fruteful trees, stones, graine, flowers, herbes, and al the grasse of the fielde hast thou ordained for the vse of man.
               We magnifie thee, O God most wise, Gen. 1, 6. 20. 21. Psa. 104, 25 10. for creating the sea, &amp; springs of water by the power of thy worde, and for giuing them virtue to bring forth fishes of al kinde to be eaten of man.
               We blesse thee, O eternal God, Gen. 1, 6. 2. Esd. 6, 41. for making the superior and lower



regions of the aier, with al birdes, and fethered foules of sondrie kindes for the foode of man.
               We glorifie thee, for giuing the whole frame of this earth, with al the creatures in the same vnto mankind, and setting man Psal. 8, 6. ouer the works of thine hands, hast subiected al things vnder his feete,
               Al sheepe and oxen Psal. 8, 7. 8., yea, and al the beastes of the field, The foules of the aire, and the fish of the sea, which walke through the paths of the sea.
               Especially we praise thee, our Lord and maker, for making vs thy creatures Gen. 1, 26. 5, 1. 9, 6. 1. Cor▪ 11, 7. Coloss. 3, 10 reasonable men according to thine owne similitude; for giuing vs reason and al the senses; and for preseruing vs hitherto.
               Thou didst nourish vs Psal. 22, 9., &amp; that wonderfully being within our mothers wombe, and out thereof Psal. 71, 6. hast thou brought vs sound in al parts without imperfection; and yet continuest thy fauor, and dost keepe vs against al dangers, and deliuerest vs from al euil: and al these things dost thou of thy fatherlie and diuine goodnes without any merit or desert of ours: for al which we are bound to thanke



thee, to praise thee, to serue, honor, and obey thee.
               We extol thy sacred Name, O God most high, for separating from the rest Eccl. 33, 9. Genes. 2, 3. Exod. 20, 11. Deut. 5, 14. a Sabbaoth daie, that so men, cessing from their handie labor, the better might serue, and celebrate thine honor.
               Who is he Psa. 106, 2. Eccl. 43, 30. that can recite al the power of the Lorde? or declare al his workes? who can number out al his praises? No man can vtter al his benefits.
               Notwithstanding, although we be miserable men, and wretched sinners, and therefore most vnmeete to extol thee according to thy deserts: yet wil we not be stil, we wil praise thee euermore to the vttermost of our power. We wil declare thy iustice and mercie: and while we liue wil we remember thy goodnes; and at no time forget thy benefits.
               O our soules Psa. 146, 1. praise the Lord, we wil praise the Lord during our life; we2. wil sing to the Lorde while we haue breath.
               We wil be mindful of our maker euen from our youth Eccl. 13, 15 and seeke him euermore: yea, euen vnto our old age



                  Psa. 71, 18. and graie head, O God, forsake vs not, vntil we haue declared thy power vnto al nations that are to come.
               Praise the Lord Psa. 117, 1., al ye nations; praise him al ye people.
               For his louing kindnes is great toward2. vs; and his truth endureth for euer.
               Praise ye the Lord in his sanctuarie Psa. 150, 1., praise him in the firmament of his power.
               Praise him in his mightie actes:2. praise him according to his excellent greatnes.

               3. A praier for the remission of sinnes.
               
               
                  RIghteous and merciful God, which art cleere from spot and sin, al thy waies Psa. 25, 10. are mercie and truth.
               We miserable folkes, and wretched sinners acknowledge the horrible corruption of our nature; and with humble and sorrowful harts bewaile



our filthines, whereby we haue polluted that image imprinted within vs at our first creation.
               We openlie confesse, that manie and great are our sinnes; our offences wonderful; our transgressions are infinite, euen as the sand of the Sea, which cannot be numbred. For al the cogitations of mans hart Gen. 6, 5. 8, 21. Matt. 15, 19. are prone to euil euermore.
               O Lord, Psa. 19, 12. who knoweth his sinnes? or who can recite al the transgressions of man?
               Behold we confesse our offences, and our sinne Psal. 51, 3, is alwaies before vs.
               Against thee onelie we haue sinned,4. and done euil in thine eies, that thou maiest be iust when thou speakest, and pure when thou iudgest.
               Behold, we were borne in iniquitie,5. and in sin did our mothers conceaue vs; and those our sinnes haue we multiplied in our dailie transgressions: and therefore haue deserued thy iust displeasure with paines eternal.
               Notwithstanding we appeale vnto thy mercie, O Lord, beseeching thee not to enter into iudgement with thy seruants Psa. 143, 2, for no flesh is righteous in thy sight. For if thou Psa. 130, 3. streitlie obseruest



iniquities, O Lorde, who shal stand? If thou wilt contend with m
                     •
                  n Iob. 9, 3. he shal not be able to answere thee one for a thousand.
               For Iob. 15, 14. what is man that he shoul be cleane; and he that is borne of a woman, that he should be iust? Behold,15. thou foundest no stedfastnes in thy Saints: yea, the heauens are not cleare in thy sight. How much more16. is man abominable and filthie, which drinketh iniquitie like water?
               Behold, Esai. 64, 6. Lord, we are al become vncleane, and al our righteousnes is like a filthie cloute.
               Wherfore we humbly beseech thee Psal. 51, 1. haue mercy vpon vs, O God, according to thy great mercy, and according to the multitude of thy compassions doe away our iniquities. Wash vs Psal. 51, 2. throughly from our iniquities, and clense vs from our sinne.
               For thy Name sake Psa. 25, 11, O Lord, be merciful vnto our iniquitie, for it is great.
               Remember not the sinnes of our7. youth, nor our rebellions, but according to thy kindnes remember thou vs, euen for thy goodnes sake, O Lord.
               Remember thy tender mercies, and6.


                  
louing kindnes, which haue bin for euer.
               Remember also Psa. 78, 39 Psa. 103, 14. that we are flesh, a wind that passeth and cometh not againe.
               Therefore, leaue thy displeasure against vs; be not angrie for euer Psal. 103, 9., neither doe thou threaten vs perpetuallie.
               Deale not with vs according to our10. sinnes, neither reward vs after our iniquities: but conuert vs, O our God of saluation, and turne away thy displeasure against vs.
               Shewe vs thy mercie, O Lord Psal. 85, 7., and grant vs thy saluation, for thy Name sake.
               O most merciful God, we confesse in deede that it lies not in our power to put away, &amp; purge our sinnes, and to purchase thy fauor: but onelie it is the passion and most innocent death of thy Sonne our Lorde Iesus Christ, the immaculate lambe, which is a sufficient recōciliation for our sins 1. Ioh. 2, 2., and yet not for ours alone, but for the sinnes also of the whole world.
               For his bloud 1. Ioh. 1, 7. which was shed for vs doth clense vs from al sinne. And, if we confesse our sins, thou art faithful9.


                  
and iust, to forgiue vs our sinnes, and to clense vs from al vnrighteousnes.
               Wherefore through confidence of this thy mercie promised by thy Sonne, we are bold with deepe sighes from hart to crie, Lord Psal. 32, 1. forgiue our offences; remit our iniquities; couer our sinnes; and impute not our faults vnto vs. Purge vs, O Lord, from our secret faults Psa. 19, 12. 13.. Keepe thy seruants also from presumptuous sinnes; let them not raigne ouer vs: so shal we be vpright, &amp; purged from our greatest wickednes, that tasting the sweetnes of thy benignitie, we may be secure and certaine of the remission of our sinnes.
               Giue the knowledge Luk. 1, 77. 78. of saluation to thy people by the remissiō of their sinnes, through the bowels of thy mercie, whereby the day spring from on high hath visited vs: that we may perceiue in our minds, both comfort, peace, and gladnes of the holy Spirit, which may begin a new life in vs pleasing thee; quench al the motions of our minds striuing with thy diuine pleasure; and restore in vs the image of thy diuine light which was lost,



that being deliuered out of the hands of our enimies, we may serue thee in feare, in holines and righteousnes al the daies of our life through Christ, in whom thou art wel pleased Mat. 3, 17. Matth. 1, 9. Luke. 3, 22., and for whose sake al our works, howsoeuer vnperfect, are acceptable in thine eies,
               Amen.
            
            
               4. A praier for the preseruation of the Church.
               
               
                  OCelestial God, and Father of infinite mercie and compassion, which not onely gatherest to thy self an holy Church in this worlde Iohn. 17, verse. 6. &amp;c. out of mankinde through the operation of the holie Ghost, and preaching of thy word, but also preseruest the same being gathered, and adornest it with al kind of temporal things, and, which more is, with eternal blisse:
               We humbly beseech thee, gratious Lord, that of thy goodnes thou wouldest vouchsafe euermore to maintaine this thy little flock Luke. 12, verse. 32., embracing, preaching, and professing thy word, through thine especial grace;



continue thy fauor toward the same; keepe it in sound doctrine, constant confessing, in the lawful vse of thine holie Sacraments, and in purenes of life, that neither the gates of hel Mat. 16, 18, the rage of Satan, nor yet the rigorousnes and tyrannie of this world oppresse the same.
               Protect, and keepe this Mat 8, 26. thy boatē and little Bark tossed among manie perilous tempests, and miserable surges in the raging Sea of this troblesome world, that it perish not being ouerwhelmed.
               Vphold thy Church, which Mat. 16, 18 is builded vpon a sure rock, and dependeth vpon Christ a sound, and vnmooueable foundation.
               O Lord of hosts, returne Psa. 80, 14., looke downe from heauen and behold, visit15. thy vine, &amp; make it perfect, which thy right hand hath planted, &amp; thou hast chosen to thy selfe. Hedge the16. same about with thy strong defence, that the branches therof being spred out, and pruned may bring forth abundance of frute.
               Raise vp thy power, Come God, &amp; saue vs Psal. 80, 7.. Conuert vs shew forth thy countenance, and we shal be saued.



Enclose thy sheepe within thine hardles: so shal we be quiet from al inuasion and scatterings, neither Ioh. 10, 28 can any drawe vs by force out of thine handes.
               Defend vs from al such, as seeke the vtter ouerthrow of pure religion; and in place thereof labour to bring in the shameful instauration of blasphemous Idolatrie.
               Suffer not thy word, that most cleere and vnchangeable light to be corrupted, or put out by our meanes, but gather to thy selfe through the sound of the Gospel such a Church, as may harken vnto thee; honor, and sanctifie thy Name, as wel in word, as in honest conuersation, that so thou maiest haue a righteous and holy generation, celebrating thy goodnes for euermore.
               Ioine vs Esai. 6, 13. vnto that company which doth worship thee continuallie; that we may be Citizens of thy kingdome among thy Saintes.
               Grant that we erre not from the foundation of wholsome doctrine, answering to the rules of the sacred Scripture: and that we offend not against our conscience; but separate vs



from the companie of vngodlie ones, and from the damned crewe of the reprobate.
               Let vs not so much as take their names into our mouthes Psal. 16, 4. Exod. 23, 13 which poure out heapes of blasphemies to thy great dishonor, and defacing of the truth: vnto whom thy Sonne is a destruction Luk. 2, 34. Rom. 9, 33. and stone of offence. For they despise his base estate, and the foolish preaching 1. Co. 1, 18 of thy Gospel, and the deformed shew of the Church, placed in the middes of al kind of miseries, they loath and abhor, preferring vncertaine riches, lordlie auctoritie, and the vaine pleasures of this transitorie world, before the profession of the truth: and so, making war with thy Sonne, they doe purchase euerlasting destruction vnto themselues.
               Keepe vs euermore, that we may abide in that Church, which is truelie Catholike, consisting of members of many nations, but linked vnto thee in one, and the same confession.
               Sanctifie vs with thine holie Spirit, that, our sinnes being forgiuen, we may take another trade of life, in acknowledging thee Ioh. 17, 3. to be the onelie



true God, and Iesus Christ whome thou hast sent.
               Giue vnto thy Church resting places, and nestes where they may sound thy sacred Gospel purelie without corruption.
               Suppresse the diuel which spreadeth blasphemies against thy doctrine: that so neither feined Gods may be erected, nor superstitious inuocations confirmed, nor thy glorie defaced.
               Weaken the power of thine enimies, which boile in hatred against thy truth, and conspire the death of thine elect: so neither shal stables of woolues be made, nor dennes of theeues established.
               O Lord God Psal. 85, 6., returne and quicken vs: so shal thy people reioice in thee. Let al such Psal. 5, 11. as trust in thee reioice, and triumph for euer: dwel thou in them, and let those which loue thy Name, reioice in thee.
               O Lord, remember not our offences, thou which wast Psal. 85, 1. somtimes merciful; And forgauedst the wickednes2. of the people, and hidedst al their sinnes; Which with drewedst al thine3. anger, and turnedst from the fiercenes



of thine indignation: Be mindfulPsal. 85, 4. of thy woonted mercie, and receiue vs into thy fauor.
               For we depend vpon thee alone, being destitute of al worldlie aide, our trust wholie is in thee, and al our confidence resteth in thy stretched out arme.
               O Lorde, Psal. 5, 11. couer vs with thy grace, as it were with a shield, that so we may be blessed; and abidingPs. 84, 9, 11. in the house of thy congregation, may acknowledge, and cal vpon thee according to thy word reuealed, and praise thee euermore, through our Lorde Iesus Christ,
               Amen.
            
            
               5. A praier for the Preachers of Gods word.
               
               
                  O Almightie, and merciful GOD, which through thy Sonne our Lorde and Sauior Christ, hast commanded vs to praie Mat 9, 38. Luke. 10, 2. Iohn. 4, 35. that laborers may be thrust into thine haruest: we beseech thee by the same thy Sonne, that thou wilt send into thy



Church faithful ministers, and syncere Preachers of thy worde, and those in number many, and in operation woonderful.
               Giue vnto vs such teachers, as are both in thy mysteries Matth. 13, verse. 11. learned, and for their conuersation, cōmended. Direct them being illuminated with thine heauenly light, that they may rightlie deliuer and diuide 1. Tim. 2, verse. 15. vnto vs the principles of true doctrine, the worde of truth, and the Gospel of life; and open the difference betweene the Lawe and the Gospel; and preach those things which are agreeable vnto the rules of faith; and can strengthen vs to beware of the leauen of the Pharisies Mat. 1
                        •
                     , 6., and the contagious doctrine of mans traditions.
               Giue vnto vs euermore syncere Preachers, and sounde interpreters, and arme them 1 Cor. 12, verse. 10. with the gift of tongues for the propagation of thy doctrine, that many through their labors and diligence may be conuerted to the true knowledge of thy diuine pleasure. For Rom. 10, verse. 14. how should we heare without a Preacher? And how should men preach 15.

               Worke so within vs, that the Diuel Mar. 4, 15. take not away the seede of thy word sowen in our harts: let it not waxe barren, neither let vs be forgetful Iam. 1, 23., nor like vnfruiteful hearers, which heare thy word to their iudgement, and greater condemnation.
               Furthermore, keepe vs in thy faith and feare, that come what crosses Mat. 13, 21. and aduersities there can, we may continually stick vnto thee



in al our miseries.
               Likewise aide vs, O God of our saluation, that the seede of thy word be not choaked among vs through cares, Luk. 8, 14. riches, and pleasures of this world.
               And finallie assist vs, that we be neuer found in the companie of mockers 2. Pet. 3, 3 1. Tim. 4, 1. into whome the Diuel hath entered, and blinded their minds Eph. 4, 17.

               O God, guider of our life Eccles. 23, verse. 4, &amp;c. forsake vs not; neither giue vs a prowd looke, and turne from vs the filthines of desire. Remooue from our harts al concupiscence, and take from thy seruants too ouerbolde a stomack; suffer vs not to run headlong into riotousnes, and bellichere; let not vnlawful loue ouercome vs, and giue not thy seruants ouer into impudent mindes. Turne our eies



                  Ps. 119, 37. that they behold no vanitie, and strengthen vs in thy waie; &amp; grant that the offences in this world ouerthrow vs not.
               Beholde, Lord, Ps. 119, 81. our soules lust after thy saluation, and we long for thy worde;
               We beseech thee, O Lord, with a most ernest affection, and humbly craue at thy merciful hands, that this daie, and euermore thou wilt keepe vs, and al ours Psal. 9, 5. from the arrow flieng in the daie, from the pestilence and plague that destroieth at noone tide. Hide vs vnder thy6. wings, and vnder thy feathers we wil haue hope.
               Blinde the eies Ps. 69, 23. of our enimies that they see not; and make their loines alwaie to tremble. But open thine eies ouer vs, and be thou vnto vs a mightie protector this daie, a firmament of strength, a couering against heate and parching, a shadowe at noone tide, a defence from offending, an assister from falling, a comforter of our soules, a lightener of our minds, and a giuer of health and happines in Christ our Lorde,
               Amen.
            
            
               
               2. A thankesgiuing for our redemption.
               
               
                  O Iesu Christ, Sonne Mat. 16, 16 Matt. 14, 33. of the liuing God, which art the eternal word Iohn. 1, 1. that was in the beginning: the true &amp; substantial image 2. Cor. 4, 4 Colos. 1, 15. Hebru. 1, 3. of thine eternal Father; the character and brightnes of his glory: begotten of him before al worlds, of one vndiuided essence, of like maiestie, and equal glorie:
               We worship thee, light of lights, verie God of verie God, begotten not made, of one substance with the Father by whom Col. 1, 16. Hebr. 1, 10. al things were made.
               We thanke thee for al thy benefits generallie, &amp; speciallie for that at an appointed time Galat. 4, 4. according to the eternal counsaile, and decree of the Father, thou didst voluntarilie for vs men, and for our saluatiō descend from heauen; and was incarnate by the holie Ghost, borne of the vnspotted and pure virgine Marie; and truelie toke our flesh vpon thee; and saued vs miserable, wretched,



and damned sinners; and deliuered vs from death, and power of Satan, 1. Pet 1, 18. not with golde and siluer; but by thine holie and precious blood, and by thine vndeserued passion19. and death, and that of thine infinite goodnes and mercie without any merits, or worthines of ours.
               For al which we yeeld thee most hartie thanks, as we are bounde. For thou alone being iust hast satisfied by thine obedience the iudgement of the Father; and, on our behalfe offering the sacrifice of thy bodie, hast deliuered vs from the tyrannie of death, whereby we were held captiues. For so great was the displeasure of thy Father against our sinnes, that no creature could asswage the same, but thou alone, O onely begotten Sonne of God.
               O Christ most merciful God, how inestimable is thy loue towards al mankind; how infinite and vnspeakable thy goodnes; how woonderful thine humilitie. For Rom. 5, verse. 6. &amp;c. 1. Pet. 3, 18. thou being iust didst die &amp; suffer for the vniust. A greater loue Ioh. 15, 13. can no man haue, than to giue his life for his friend: but thou commendest thine abundant,



&amp; most burning affection toward vs, in that, being voide 1. Pe. 2, 22. 2. Cor. 5, 21. Rom. 5, 6. of al fault, thou wouldest suffer death for our sakes, being as yet strangers Col. 1, 21., &amp; thine enimies, and hast reconciled vs by thy death vnto thy Father, and appeased his most heauie displeasure, forgiuing al our sinnes, and cancelling the hand writing Col. 2, 14. which was against vs, which was contrarie vnto vs hast taken it out of the way, and fastened it vpon the crosse: And hast spoiled principalities and powers,15. and made a shew of them openlie, triumphing ouer them by thy selfe, and by thy profitable arising againe from the dead hast repared our true righteousnes which consisteth in the forgiuing of our sins: and hast made vs acceptable to thy Father, whereby wee please him through our reconciliation: thou dost comfort our harts by the preaching of thy Gospel, which worketh in vs the beginning of eternal life, and by thine holie Spirit thou kindlest in vs like motions vnto thy selfe, whereby we please thy Father through thee and thine obedience.
               O Lord Iesu Christ, lambe of God



                  Ioh. 1, 29. which takest awaie the sins of the world, haue mercie vpon vs; thou which sauest vs through thine owne merit &amp; virtue, grant vs thy grace, that the fruit of thy most sacred passion, may worke effectually and profitablie within vs; let not the labor which thou hast taken, &amp; the paine that thou hast suffered for our redemption be in vaine through our vnthankfulnes.
               O thou eternal intercessor, word of God, and 1. Cor. 1, vers. 23. &amp;c. his wisedome, which outwardlie speakest vnto vs by the preaching of the Gospel, instruct inwardlie our troubled harts by thy liuely word, and effectual consolation, that being mindful of thy sacrifice and suffering for our sinnes, we may feele true comfort and peace of the holie Spirit in our harts.
               Kindle in our brests a liuelie faith depending vpon thy benefits, that being deliuered from the feare of hel, we may finde 1. Cor. 1, verse. 30. righteousnes in thee, &amp; eternal life. For thou didst suffer Rom. 4, 25 for our sinnes, &amp; rise againe for our iustification, that liuing we shold her after not liue to our selues, but to thee which diedst, and rosest



againe for vs.
               Grant therefore 2 Cor. 5, verse. 15. Roman. 6, verse. 4, &amp;c. that likewise being quickned we may rise againe from al our sinnes, and liue in thee; and may be thine properlie abiding in thy kingdome, &amp; serue thee with a willing minde in righteousnes and true holines: so that at length 1. Pe. 3, 21. in the latter daie we may rise againe with our bodies vnto a blessed life, and so both in bodie &amp; soule being redeemed from al euils, in perpetual blisse &amp; happines may triumph with al thine holie Angels, Patriarches, Prophets, and al thine elect, and endued with vnspeakable and euerlasting ioie, may praise thee our Sauior, which hast ascended aboue al the heauens, &amp; sittest at the right hand of God the Father almightie, with whom thou liuest and reignest for euermore,
               Amen.
            
            
               3. A praier for Faith.
               
                  O Eternal God, and heauenlie Father, which Reue. 1, 8. art Alpha, &amp; Omega, the beginning &amp; the ending: thou art the



cause, and absolute perfection of our life and saluation: the euerlasting and infinit good, from whom proceedeth euerie I am. 1, 17. good giuing and euerie perfect gift, to wit from the Father of lights, with whom is no variablenes, neither shadowing by turning:
               We beseech thee in the Name of our Sauior Christ thy Sonne, that through thine holie Spirit thou wilt plant in our harts a true knowledge of the same thy Sonne, and keepe vs therein euermore; &amp; make it plentiful and prosper euerie daie, that replenished with the knowledge of thy wil, in al wisedome and spiritual vnderstanding, we may walke Philipp. 1. verse. 27. Colos. 1, 10. Ephes. 4, 1. 1. Thes. 2, 10 1. Cor. 1, 5. worthie the Lorde, pleasing thee in al things, being fruitful in al good works, and encreasing in thy knowledge: Col. 1, 11. strengthened in al might through his glorious power vnto al patience, and long suffering with ioiefulnes: and may 2. Cor. 8, 7 abounde in faith, and word, and knowledge, and al diligence.
               For this cause we bowe our knees Eph. 3, 14. vnto thee Father of our Lorde Iesus Christ (of whom is named the15.


                  
whole family in heauen &amp; in earth)Ephes. 3, 16. that thou wilt grant vs according to the riches of thy glorie, that we may be strengthened by thine holie Spirit into new men; that Christ may17. dwel in our harts by faith; being rooted and grounded in loue, may18. be able with al Saints to comprehende the true knowledge of thine essence and wil, according vnto thy word reuealed.
               No man 1. Iohn. 4, verse. 12. 1 Tim. 6, 16. Exo. 33, 20. hath seene thee, O God, at anie time; neither hath anie behelde the countenance of thy Maiestie. For Mat. 11, 27 no man knoweth the Sonne which is of thy verie substance, but thou the Father alone; neither hath any knowen thee but the Sonne, &amp; he to whom he doth reueale thee.
               Wherefore we beseech thee of thine infinit goodnes and mercie Ioh. 6, 44. draw vs vnto him, &amp; let him bring vs vnto thee. Giue the knowledge Luk. 1, 77. of saluation to thy people, by the remission of their sinnes through thy tender mercie: that in thy Sonne Ephes. 1, 7. we may find righteousnes, euen remission of sinnes, reconciliation, and newnes of our mindes through the



holie Spirit, whereby we may become heires of eternal life, being iustified Titus. 3, 5 by the grace of Christ, in whom we beleeue, which was offered for our sinnes. For he taking our punishment vpon himselfe, did satisfie thy iustice fullie, and washed vs by his pretious blood Reuel. 1, 5. from al our iniquities; and reconciled vs Col. 1, 21. in the bodie of his flesh through death, to make vs holie, and blameles,22. and without fault in thy sight.
               Make vs therfore strong in faith, and constant to resist al the ingins of Satan; and proceeding from faith to faith to attaine that righteousnes which is auaileable before thee by the redemption Rom. 3, 24▪ 25. which is in Christ Iesu, whom thou hast appointed to be a reconciliation through faith in his blood, that iustified by his grace we may haue peace of conscience, and free accesse vnto the Father.
               Holie, and merciful God, we humblie beseech thee, which hast raised in vs the sparkles of true faith, make perfect this good which thou hast begon in vs Philip. 1, 6, and bring it vntil the daie of our Lord Iesu Christ; wherby abounding more and more in9.


                  
knowledge and in al iudgement, we may allow the better, and be purePhilip. 1, 10. without offence vntil that daie, filled with the, fruite of righteousnes11. which are by Iesus Christ vnto the glorie, and praise of God.
               Wherefore Psa. 68, 28. appoint thy strength, establish, O God, which thou hast wrought in vs: that fighting 1. Tim. 1, 18 a good fight we may retaine faith &amp; a good conscience, least vnder persecution19. and aduersities being tossed, we make shipwrack of our faith.
               Helpe our weake and feeble faith, which is like the graine of mustard seede within vs Mat. 17, 20. Luke. 17, 6., that encreasing dailie more and more, it may take deepe roote, and remaine firme alwaies and immoueable: and neuer vanish awaie among so many sectes and diuisions in this worlde.
               Extinguish al the doubtings of thy wil sticking in our corrupt nature; let vs not mistrust thy promises of eternal and temporal benefits, but applieng thy promises vnto our selues, alwaies giue credit vnto thy worde; and so depending wholie therevpon, contrarie to al sense of humane reason, we shal obteine a



crowne of immortal glorie.
               Grant likewise, heauenlie Father, Iam. 2, 14. that our faith be not barren, vaine, or dead without good workes, and fruites Gal. 5, 22. of the Spirit, but effectual working by charitie, that we may receiue 1. Pet. 1, 9. the ende of our faith, euen the saluation of our soules; and behold thee, whome we now see by faith as it were in a glasse darklie 1. Cor. 13, verse. 12., in another world, looking vpon thy Maiestie face to face in Christ our Sauior, our Lord, and God,
               Amen.
            
            
               4. A praier for the Kingdome of God.
               
               
                  MErciful, and gratious God, which hast called vs 1. Thes. 2, verse. 12. vnto thy kingdome and glorie; and of thy fatherlie and good pleasure enioined vs this care, that first Mat. 6, 33. and afore al things we should seeke thy Kingdome, and the righteousnes thereof:
               We beseech thee through, and for thy Sonne our Lorde, and Sauior Christ his sake, teach our weake minds; gouerne our wil and harts,



that, without inuerting this thine appointed order, we may first seeke that thou maiest shine within vs; apprehende thy righteousnes by a true and liuelie faith, and be vnited vnto thee our eternal King.
               Grant therefore that thy worde may be preached euerie where plainelie and purelie without fraud, and that 2. Cor. 10, verse. 5. we may cast downe al our imaginations, and euerie hie thing that is exalted against thy knowledge; and leade our vnderstanding captiue to the obedience of the worde which thou hast deliuered: and obey thy Gospel in al simplicitie of faith, according to the good plesure of thy wil Ephes. 1, 6. to the praise of the glorie of thy grace.
               Assist vs, O our Father which art in heauen, that both thy word may be purely and sincerely preached, &amp; we thereby, as becometh the sonnes of God, reformed in our liues.
               Giue vs thine holie Spirit, that we may beleeue thy word through thy grace, and so leade a godlie and virtuous life in this worlde, and liue hereafter with thy sonne in eternal blisse.
               
                  Breake thou of, and hinder al the consultations and deuises, both of the diuel, the worlde, and the flesh, which do neither sanctifie thine holie Name, nor suffer thy kingdome to be brought vnto vs.
               Comfort, and keepe vs stronglie in thy word, and faith, euen til our liues ende: that so both thy good and gratious wil may be done in our harts, and they which as yet beleeue not thy worde, by our good conuersation 1. Pet. 2, 12 1 Pet. 3, 16. Matth. 5, 16., may be wonne to thy Gospel, and glorifie thee our God to the encrease of thy celestial kingdome.
               Make vs meete Col. 1, 12. to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light; Thou which hast deliuered vs 13. from the power of darknes, &amp; translated vs into the kingdome of thy beloued sonne Mat. 3, 17. Matth. 17, 5. Hebru. 1, 5. in whom Col. 1, 14. 23. we haue redemption through his blood, that is the remission of sinnes; that we may be grounded and stablished in faith, and not mooued awaie from the hope of the Gospel, but may walke 1. Cor. 1, 8. Ephes. 1, 4. Colos. 1, 22. vnblameable, and without fault in thy sight as it becommeth the children of light 1. Tim. 2, 2 in al godlines



and honestie.
               And forasmuch as thy kingdome Rom. 14, verse. 17. is not meate nor drinke, neither consisteth in ceremonies and traditions, which are inuented by man, neither commeth it with obseruations Luke. 17, verse. 20.; neither is it in word 1. Cor. 4, verse. 20. but in righteousnes Rom. 14, verse. 17., and peace, and ioie in the holie Ghost, and 1. Thes. 1, 5 in power: Grant, O eternal God, that we, being borne anew 1. Pe. 1, 23. by thy word and holie Spirit, may attaine the inheritance 1. Pet. 1, 4. of eternal life; and lifting vp our harts on hie Coloss. 3. verse. 1, &amp; 2. where Christ sitteth at thy right hande, may set our affections on things which are aboue, and not on things on the earth.
               Therefore be thou present with vs in these latter daies of the world and begin thy kingdome in vs; prosper the same with thy diuine assistance, that we may be conformable vnto thy godlie pleasure, purchasing thy fauor in this world, and afterward in thy newe kingdome, in the kingdome of glorie, where thou God art al in al, may ioiefullie remaine with thee for euermore.
               Grant therefore that we may be



                  Matth. 5, verse. 3, &amp;c. Luke. 6, 20. poore in spirit, in hart humble, sorowful in minde for our offences; and may with al our harts hunger Matth. 5, verse. 6, &amp;c. and thirst after righteousnes: Make vs lowlie and courteous; liberal, and pittiful, pure in hart and peacemakers, likewise in persecutions and trobles patient, that we neither take nor giue offence vnto any; but may exercise our selues in the workes of charitie, and of mercie, feeding the hungrie Matth. 25, vers. 35, &amp;c. giuing drinke to the thirstie, clothing the naked Esai. 58, 7. Ezec. 18. 7., lodging strangers, comforting the weake, and visiting the imprisoned.
               Finallie, of thine abundant mercie, grant, that in thy last iudgement we may heare that ioieful, and most cōfortable voice of thy welbeloued Sonne, saieng Matth. 25, verse. 34. Come ye blessed of my Father, inherite the kingdome prepared for you from the foundations of the worlde,
               Amen.
            
            
               5. A praier for Magistrates.
               
                  OMost mightie GOD, King of al the world, which by thine holie Spirit hast commanded 1. Tim. 2, 1. that supplications,



praiers, intercessions, and giuing of thanks be made for al men: for Kings and for al that are in auctoritie,1. Tim. 2, 2. which thou hast placed Eccl. 10, 4. to be rulers of the earth according to thy good wisedome, and set in gouernement at thy good pleasure. For thou exaltest some vnto the top of honor Iob. 36, 7. and protectest their dignitie (thou castest not downe the mighty which art mighty thy selfe) and placest Kings in their throne. For al power Rom. 13, 1. Wisdo. 6, 3. is from thee.
               We beseech thee therefore euen with deepe sighs of hart, O Lord of Lordes, that forgiuing our sinnes thou woldest giue good Rulers; and also maintaine their auctoritie. For among men there is no place for Lawe and iustice, where the rulers and princes whom thou hast appointed are not feared.
               Vphold al the states, and gouernors of this realme; and protect them from destruction in these greuous calamities, and miserable disorder of these latter daies.
               Especiallie preserue our Noble Queene, and hir godlie Counsaile: grant them a long, healthful, &amp; good



life; that they may deuoutlie serue thee, and iustlie doe their office.
               Lighten their minds with the knowledge of thy sacred word, that they may deale wisely Psal. 2, 10. and be learned which iudge the earth; seruing11. thee in feare, and reioicing in trembling. Let them embrace discipline12. and kisse the Sonne the Sauior of the world: least happilie he be angrie, and they perish in the waie.
               Blesse them, O God, that they may alwaies hope in thee, Esa. 49, 23. nourish thy ministers, giue reliefe vnto thy Gospel; and open their gates Psal. 24, 7. that the King of glorie may come in, the8. Lord of power, which is mightie in battel.
               Giue them a care of godlines, that they may giue their goods to the erecting &amp; cherishing of the church; and shew themselues Patrones and defenders of the same. Make them diligent in rooting out superstition, and in promoting thy Kingdome; in maintaining the puritie of doctrine; in remoouing al offences; and finallie in wyping awaie al filthines which both defile thy religion, and deface thy glory: that the commers



after vs haue none occasion of transgressing.
               Blesse them with sober counsaile, wisedome, industrie and courage of minde. Giue them good successe in al their enterprises, &amp; prosper their doings. Let them consider that they are placed to defend the good and innocent; and with seuere punishment Rom. 13, 4 to correct the wicked and rebellious: so shal wickednes Deu. 13, 11. Deut. 17, 13. be taken from among vs, and the publike state remaine in safetie, to the preseruation of mankind, and continuance both of common &amp; Christian peace to the glorie of thy sacred Maiestie, and the commoditie of their subiects; to the rooting out of ignorance and error; and to the furtherance of good artes, honest trades, and liberal studies.
               And forasmuch Prou. 21, 1. as the harts of Kings, Queenes, and of al men are in thine handes, so that thou canst turne them at thy pleasure, we beseech thee, almightie and merciful God, that it would please thee to turne from crueltie to clemencie the minds of al Tyrans and vnmerciful Princes, that they mooue not



war against thee rashlie, wherby the course of thy diuine worde may be hindered; worldlie substance wickedlie consumed; and their subiects polled vnreasonably &amp; deuoured:
               But giue vnto al in auctoritie quiet harts, desirous of christian concord, that they may remember they are the ministers of God to maintaine his glorie, &amp; to keepe their people from iniurie and oppression; and beare the sword Rom. 13, 4. to take vengance on them which doe euil on the behalfe of God. For they rule not for their owne cause, but for the publike welfare; neither may they doe what they list, but are bound to seeke the profit of their subiectes, and to set forth the glorie of God.
               Let them not therefore abuse their auctoritie &amp; power: but grant them grace to remember continuallie that they are mortal men, whose Lord is in heauen, which respecteth no person Eph. 6, 9.; and afore whose iudgment seat Psal. 9, 7. 2. Cor. 5, 10. Rom. 14, 10. Wisd. 6, 5. they must al appeare, and giue an account vnto thee the true and righteous God, iudge both of the quicke and dead, which raignest and rulest for euermore,
               Amen.
            
            
               
               6. A praier for Subiects.
               
                  O Most merciful God, at thy beck do al things bow, both in heauen, and in earth; at thy voice doe both wind Mat. 8, 26. and seas obey, confessing thy Maiestie.
               Euerie knee Phili. 2, 10 Rom. 14, 11. Esai. 45, 23. boweth vnto thee both of things in heauen, &amp; things in earth, &amp; things vnder the earth: meete it is also that we obeie thee, which hast commanded al Subiects to giue due obedience Rom. 13, 1. 1. Pet. 2, 13. and reuerence vnto their lawful Magistrates, which subiection thou hast inioined vnto vs not onelie to auoide punishment, but especiallie to keepe and reteine a good conscience. For al auctoritie is ordained by thee Rom. 13, 2, that the world euerie where may be godlie and quietlie gouerned. For much more safelie doe we liue vnder lawes and iudgement, than if euerie man had the bridle at wil to roaue as he list.
               We beseech thee therefore, O eternal God, that first of al in euerie



thing, and in al things, we may obey thee 1. Tim. 1, 17 our most high and mightie God, King of the whole world before any creature, and that in true faith, and godlie feare.
               Next Ephes. 6, 5. that al Subiects, and priuate persons with al singlenes of hart, in al thinges, which are not contrarie to thy worde, may obeie their publike Magistrate hauing power &amp; auctoritie ouer them; and submit themselues 1. Pet. 2, 13 to euerie ciuil ordinance, for thy sake, not to the King onelie as to the chiefe, but to14. other inferior officers sent from him, for the punishment of euil doers, and for the praise of the good. Let them alwaies remember that this subiection and obedience thou requirest to be showen as to thine owne ordinance, whereby the safetie of mankind is maintained.
               Wherefore bend thou our harts, and guide them, that we enuie not the honor due to our Superiors; neither obraie, nor backbyte them, but rather, honoring them most dutifullie, may both praie 1. Tim. 2, 1. for them, and paie with willing mindes whatsoeuer by the ciuil law, and by



nature we are bound to doe.
               Be it far from vs, O Almightie God, that any of vs should despise, raile Exo. 22, 28 Acts. 23, 5. or in his hart wish euil vnto his Prince, or Superiors. For thou hast vouchsafed them the title of Gods Psal. 82, 6. in the holie Scriptures: because they rule in thy steed here on the earth. Hence it is, that whosoeuer resist their Superiors Rom. 13, 2, and forsake the yoke of obedience, are said to resist thine ordinance, and shal receiue to themselues iudgement, running into the foule crime of treson against thy sacred person; and staining their conscience with the filthie spot of obstinacie and disobedience, giuing an occasion vnto the wicked to slander thy Gospel.
               Grant also that inferiors, &amp; subiects be not burdened with ouer great &amp; new exactions, vnlawful paiments, and intollerable tributes, neither oppressed with greeuous seruitude, or pilled by any other violence, or tyrannie. And if in any place Lions and woolues shew their crueltie toward thy seruants, their godlie Subiects, plucking their skinnes Mica. 3, 2. from them, breaking their bones, and deuouring



thy people none otherwise than if they shoulde eate bread Psal. 14, 4. giue patience vnto thine afflicted members, that they may quietlie susteine their miserable seruitude, as a crosse sent from thee 1. Pet. 1, 7. Wisd. 3, 5. Deut. 8, 2. Eccles. 2, 5. Prou. 17, 3. for a trial of their faith and patience.
               Aide vs with thy comfort, whereby we may with patient minds suffer the trobles which in this last and doting age of this world more and more encrease; remembring that thou God, hast prepared thy throne Psal. 9, 7. 8. in iudgement to iudge the worlde in equitie, and thy people with righteousnes; to be a refuge for the poore, and an helper in due time,9. euen in affliction. For Psal. 9, 18. the poore shal not alwaie be forgotten: the hope of the afflicted shal not perish for euer.
               Wherefore listen thou vnto the praier and sighes of thy seruants which crie vnto thee, &amp; aide them, as thou didst the children of Israël, whose miserie, calamitie, and bondage thou didst behold, Ezod. 3, 7. 8. deliuering them frō the greeuous seruitude of Egypt; and bringing them out of the yron fornace Deu. 4, 20. of Pharao, through



thy mighty and stretched out arme.
               Keepe vs also from vngodlie and idolatrous Magistrates, that we be not vnder the yoke, and gouernement of Infidels &amp; Ethnikes, which wil be vnto vs and our posteritie in steede of thornes and prickes Iosua. 23, verse. 13. offering continual occasions of Apostasie, &amp; reuolting from true religion.
               Suffer not the rod of the wicked Psa. 125, 3 to rest vpon the lot of the righteous, least the righteous put forth their hand vnto wickednes.
               Breake in peeces the scepters of the wicked: and Rom. 6, 12 deliuer vs from the yoake of sinne, that wee offer not our members as instruments of vnrighteousnes, and that wickednes rage not in our mortal bodies to the suppressing of the soule and bodie, which liuest and raignest in al eternitie,
               Amen.

                  garde the workes of thine handes: therefore destroie and ouerthrowe them, so that they neuer be able to arise againe.
               O God of Sabbaoth, fight thou against them Psal. 35, 1. that fight against vs; laie hand vpon thy shield and buckler,2. &amp; stand vp for our helpe; bring out also the speare, and encounter3. with them which persecute vs, that we may knowe thy saluation on the earth.
               Giue the victorie ouer thine enimies vnto our Magistrates, capitaines, and conductors of thy people. Blessed be the Lorde Ps. 144, 1. our strength which teacheth the hands of our soldiors to fight; and their fingers to war. For thou art our aide,2. and the defence in whom we trust; thou destroiest al our enimies. For 1. Mach. 3, verse. 19. 2. Chr. 20, 6 the victorie commeth from heauen, and is not gotten by the multitude of an host. The King is not saued Psa. 33, 16. by the multitude of warriers; neither is the mightie man deliuered by his great strength. An horse17. is a vaine thing; and shal not deliuer anie by his mightie bones. But Iudit. 9, 11. Iudges. 7, 2. thine, O Lord, is the power. Thou



canst aswel saue by a fewe 2. Chro. 14 verse. 11. 2. Chr. 16, 8. as by manie. Saluation belongeth vnto the Lord Psal. 3, 8., and his blessing is vpon the people.
               Wherefore Psa. 10, 15. breake thou the arme of the vngodlie; weaken their strength; bring al their counsailes to naught; destroie them which trust in their multitudes Iudit. 9, 7. and in their chariots, &amp; in their speares, shields, and arrowes. For thou art our God which breakest the battels; the Lorde is thy Name. Lift vp thine8. arme as thou didst in the beginning, &amp; breake their strength with thy power. Ouerthrowe their force9. in thy displeasure, which vowe to violate thy sanctuarie, and to pollute the Tabernacle of thy most glorious Name. Grant Lord that with10. their owne sword their pride may be cut of.
               Let them al be confounded Psal. 6, 10. which hate thee; let thē 
                  Psal. 35, 4. be broght to shame which deale wickedlie. Let them be as chaffe Psalm. 1, 4. Psal. 35, 5. before the wind, and let thine Angel scatter them. Let the enimies of thy Chuch blush and be trobled greatlie; let them be turned back and brought to speedie



confusion, that thy Name be not blasphemed among the Gentiles,
               Amen.
            
            
               8. Euening praier, on Mondaie.
               
               
                  O ALMIGHTIE, and merciful God, thou hast made the Moone for certaine seasons Ps. 104, 19.; the Sunne, which thou hast created, knoweth his going downe; Thou makest darknes, and20. it is night, wherin men betake them to rest, cease from their worke, and recreate their wearied members through sleepe. Thou art the God Esai. 45, 7. forming light, and creating darknes.
               Therefore in the euening we wil praise thee, and going to bed wil giue thee thanks, because thou hast kept vs this daie of thine onelie mercie without any merit of ours from al danger and hurt.
               When we are in troble we cal vpon



thee, and in the euening wil we remember thy mercie and truth, which thou hast shewed vnto vs abundantlie.
               Our eies preuent Ps. 119, 148 the night watches to meditate vpon thy wonderful things; and our studies shal be alwaies of the excellencie of thy Name. For Psal. 57, 3. thou hast sent from heauen and deliuered vs; and hast brought them to shame that troade vpon vs. O God, thou hast sent thy4. mercie and truth, and taken our soules from the mids of them which compassed vs about.
               Therefore Psal. 54, 6. we wil sacrifice freelie vnto thee, and praise thy most glorious Name. For thou hast deliuered7. vs from al troble, and our eies haue seene our desire vpon our enimies.
               O Lorde, God of our saluation Psal. 88, 1., daie and night doe we crie before thee; when our eies are trobled through griefe and bitternes of our soules, we poure out our teares before thee, and in this place we humblie beseech thee, couer and put out al our offences; that as the Sunne of this daie is now downe and hidden:



so thou woldest also hide al our iniquities, and drowne al our offences Mica. 7, 19. in the bottom of the sea, that they neuer be seene with eies, nor come forth into iudgement.
               O our God, we blush, and are ashamed to lift vp our eies vnto thee. For we are not worthie to lift vp our eies vnto Heauen, because Psa. 40, 11. our sinnes are mo than the heares of our head. Our offences haue taken such hold on vs that we are vnable to looke vp.
               We haue sinned, O Lord, we haue sinned Dan. 9, 5. and haue committed iniquitie, yea, we haue rebelled, and departed from thy precepts, &amp; from thy iudgements; We haue not obeied6. thy seruants which spake in thy Name to our Kings, to our Princes, and to our Fathers, and to al the people of the lande.
               O Lord, righteousnes belongeth7. vnto thee; but vnto vs open shame and confusion.
               O Lord Tob. 3, 2. thou art iust, and al thy works, and al thy waies are mercie and truth; thou iudgest truelie and rightlie for euer. Remember vs, and3. looke vpon vs according to the multitude



of thy mercies, neither punish vs for our sinnes, nor remember our offences, nor our forefathers, which haue not obeied thy commandements.
               We faint Psal. 6, 6. in our mourning, we wil cause our bed to swim, and water our coutch with teares. Our eies7. be trobled through the griefe of our wickednes, and our faces be withered.
               O Lord, God of hosts, Psa. 84, 8. 9. heare our praier; O God our protector behold and looke vpon the face of Christ thine onelie begotten Sonne making intercession for vs, and winke at our offences.
               Hide thy face from our sinnes Psa 51, 9. &amp; blot out al our iniquities. Create in vs cleane harts, O God, and renue10. right spirits within vs. Cast vs not away from thy presence, &amp; take11. not thine holie spirit frō vs. Restore to vs the ioie of thy saluation and12. stablish vs with thy free Spirit, that we may doe al things according to thy wil, and serue thee alwaies with a willing minde.
               O Christ King of glorie, we beseech thee blessed Lorde, defend vs



this night; let our rest be in thee, graunt vs thy grace that neither much sleepe ouerwhelme vs, nor Satan inuade vs; nor the flesh betraie vs vnto him and make vs giltie in thy sight.
               Let our eies sleepe, but let our harts wake, &amp; cause thy right hand to protect such as trust in thee. O Lord, lighten our eies that we slepe not in death, that Satan hurt vs not, and our enimie saie, Psal. 13, 4. I haue preuailed against them.
               Watch ouer vs, O eternal Sauior, least the subtil tempter ouertake vs, and we sleepe a perpetual sleepe Ierem. 51, ve. 39, &amp; 57., and wake no more. For thou art made our euerlasting helper.
               Keepe vs as the apple of thine eie, Psal. 17, 8. hide vs vnder the shadowe of thy wings, O Lorde, that neither ouglie visions, nor horrible dreames, nor sightes and monsterous apparitions Wisd. 17, 4 troble vs in the darke.
               In thy Name, O sweete Iesu, wil we go to bed, and giue sleepe to our eies, and slomber to our eie lids, compasse vs about, and raise vs againe to the ioieful sight of tomorrow light; and after this miserable



life bring vs to the beholding of eternal happines, that in thy light Psal. 36, 9. we may see light, and euermore praise thee raigning worlds without ende,
            
            Amen.

                  O Almightie, euerliuing, true, &amp; merciful God, eternal Father of our Lord Iesu Christ, which together Ephe. 3, 9. with thy Sonne and the holie Ghost hast created the frame of this worlde withal things therin conteined, and preseruest the same as yet according to thy free pleasure: al creatures without ceassing euermore should extol and praise thee, &amp; that



doe euen the very fowles of the aire Wis. 17, 17 Psal. 104, 12. which earelie in the morning among the thick branches of trees, and from the mids of rocks, giuing out their sound and flieng about in the aire with most pleasant tunes doe magnifie thee the eternal God, Lord, and Creator of al things.
               And therfore we men also earelie in the morning shold praise thee for thy benefits, and euermore extol thy mercie with diuine commendations.
               Thou hast preserued vs this night passed, and from our cradles to this present houre hast thou kept vs safe. Thou hast caused vs to come from sleepe and darkenes vnto the light of this daie: and from our beds through thy benignitie we doe arise in safetie.
               Hadst not thou, O Lorde, bin present with vs, and watched vs, the insatiable crueltie of Satan had deuoured vs. Hadst not thou kept our houses and vs Psa. 127, 1. the keeper of the Citie had watched in vaine.
               If the Lorde had not bin on our side Psa. 124, 1. when men rose vp against vs, they had then swallowed vs vp3.

Blessed be the Lorde which6. hath not giuen vs a praie for their teeth. Our soules are escaped, euen7. as a bird out of the snare of the foulers, the snare is broken, and we are deliuered. Our helpe is in the8. Name of the Lorde which hath made both heauen and earth.
               Now harken therefore vnto our words, O Lorde, Psal. 5, 2. marke our crie, vnderstand the voice of our praier, our King and our God. For vnto3. thee, Lorde we wil praie, heare our voice in the morning.
               Earelie wil we stand before thee, and behold thy fortitude and Maiestie, looking for thine assistance with a woonderful desire.
               O God and gouernor, raise vs vp earelie Esai. 50, 4. earelie we saie li

                  t vp our eares to the hearing of thee our instructor. Open thou our eares Prou. 2, 2. that we rebel not against thee, neither yet go backwarde; but let thy voice



sound in our eares: make them obedient vnto thee Psal. 40, 6. that we be not obstinate like the serpent, neither hardened like the deafe adder Psal. 58, 4. which stoppeth his eares: but let them be open Esai. 8, 20. to heare thy Lawes and testimonies: and harken alwaies vnto the crie of the poore Pro. 21, 13.; that the morning light may rise vnto vs, and our light breake foorth as the daie, and our health spring vp sodeinlie.
               Againe, Eccle. 28, verse. 24. shut vp our eares, hedge them in with thornes, and put bars vpon them, that they neither admit nor allowe false doctrine, and that they turne not 2. Tim. 4, verse. 4. from the truth to fables, and other follies.
               But thou, O our God and Creator, which didst plant the eare Psa. 94, 9. &amp; hearest al things, make the same with a willing and readie minde to obeie thee our maker and Redeemer.
               Heare vs, Lorde, for thy louing kindnes is good Psa. 69, 16. turne vnto vs according to the multitude of thy tender mercies: &amp; Lam. 3, 56▪
                   stop not thine eare from our sighing and from our crie.
               Incline thine eare Psal. 86, 1., O Lord, and heare vs, for we are poore and needie.



Haue mercie on vs, O Lord, because we crie vnto thee al the daie long. Let vs heare thy louing kindnes Psa. 143, 8. in the morning, which is better than al riches, yea, than life it selfe; make vs to heare ioie Psal. 51, 8. and gladnes, that the bones which thou hast broken may reioice.
               We beseech thee, O eternal God, by the incarnation and natiuitie of thy Sonne Iesu Christ, that through thy worde entering into our eares, and mindes, thou wilt transforme vs into new men, and be borne of thee, and as new borne babes 1. Pet. 2, 2. may desire that milke not of bodie, but of the minde which knowes no deceipt: whereby we may growe, and3. taste how sweete thy promise is vnto the godlie; which embrace the same through faith: and that laieng aside 1. Pet. 2, 1. al malitiousnes, and guile, and al dissimulation and enuie, we may walke as children, 1. Cor. 14, verse. 20. but in vnderstanding, may be perfect.
               And being thus regenerated, kepe vs, O eternal God, both this day and at al times from euil tydings Psa. 112, 7. that our eares heare no rumors of wars, nor be terrefied by any greeuous



chance. Fil vs in this houre with thy fauor, that al this daie reioicing together, we may delight in thy praises, through our Lord Iesus Christ which liueth and raigneth with thee for euermore,
               Amen.

                  O God the holie Ghost which proceedest Ioh. 15, 26. from the Father and the Sonne, and with them art worshipped and glorified in the vnitie 1. Ioh. 5, 7. of the true and eternal Deitie, and art also the substantial amitie betweene the Father and the Sonne:
               We worship thee, we praise and glorifie thee, and with our whole hart we thanke thee for al thy benefits: especiallie for calling vs by the voice of the Gospel 2. Timo. 
                        •
                     , verse. 7, &amp;c. vnto the Christian congregation; for illuminating vs with thy gifts; for sanctifieng vs with a stedfast faith, and for keeping vs hetherto in the same. For by the font of the wholesome lauor, that is, by the water of holie



baptisme, being poured into vs, thou dost continuallie worke in vs regeneration Titus. 3, 5. and renuing of the inwarde man.
               Harken we beseech thee, vnto our supplication, &amp; teach vs miserable men, which by the proper strength of our only reason cā by no meanes trust in, or approch to Christ our Lorde and Sauiour, teach vs, O our God, what thy pleasure is, and leade vs Ioh. 16, 13. into al truth. For 1. Cor. 12, 3 without thine assistance none can saie that Iesus is the Lord.
               O blessed light, fil the inwarde partes of thy faithful; without thy grace nothing is within man, which is not hurtful. Wash that is filthie; water that is drie; heale that is wounded; bow the obstinate; cherish the frozen; and reclame them which wander. Giue to thy faithful trusting in thee, the reward of wel doing; the entrance into happines, and euerlasting comfort.
               Thou in thy giftes Esal. 11, 2. seuenfold, which art the Spirit of the Lord, the spirit of wisdome &amp; vnderstanding, the spirit of counsel &amp; strength; the spirit of knowledge, and of the feare



of the Lord: inspire into vs through the preaching of the Gospel, thine heauenlie wisedome about thine essence and diuine pleasure, which is hid from the world.
               Grant that we may know the Father and the Sonne by thee, and may alwaies beleeue that thou art the spirit of them both: and so worship one God in trinitie, and the trinitie in vnitie: whose wil is, that not one should perish Eze. 33, 11. Ezech. 3, 21. but be conuerted and liue; and Ioh. 6, 40. that as many as beleeue in the Sonne should haue euerlasting life. For Ioh. 3, 17. Iohn. 9, 39. Iohn. 12, 47. the Father sent the Sonne not to condemne the worlde: but that the worlde through him might be saued.
               O Lightener of the minde, poure vpon vs thy new light, and purge the horrible darknes of our minds, so that we may see and knowe our chiefe Father, whom Matt. 5, 8. pure eies onlie doe behold.
               O thou heauenlie comforter Iohn. 15, verse. 26. Iohn. 14, 26. giue vnto vs a testimonie; &amp; grant vnto our minds a token of the certaintie of our beliefe, so that wee doubt not, neither wauer about thy diuine goodnes toward vs.
               
                  Make our harts quiet and secure, that with a ful trust and confidence Heb. 4, 16. we may approch to the throne of thine heauenlie grace, receiuing Galat. 4, 5. by adoption the right of children; and inflamed with spiritual ioie in al boldnes and libertie Rom. 8, 15 may crie, Abba Father.
               Thou which art the earnest Ephes. 1, ve. 13, &amp; 14. 2. Cor. 5, 5. of our inheritance to the redemption of the promise, and art effectual by thy worde and Sacraments; signe our harts with the seale 2. Cor. 1, 22 Ephes. 4, 3. of thy promise, whereby we may haue the same, and retaine it surelie in our harts, through thy deede.
               Thou most faithful Aduocate Iohn. 16, 7. strengthen vs against al the assaults and tentations of Satan: so that we may neuer doubt of thy diuine prouidence and predestination, whereby we are chosen and called in Christ vnto euerlasting life, and neuer, being stroken with a seruile feare, and oppressed with dreadful doubtings, may in a rage flie and forsake our God.
               O surpassing comforter, leaue vs not destitute of thine aide, and patronage, but vouchsafe euermore



to be present with vs in our crosses and trobles; least otherwise we faint. But rather make vs to reioice in tribulations, knowing Iam. 1, 12. that a crowne of life is laide vp for such as loue him.
               O thou teacher of men instruct vs how, and what we ought to praie for Rom. 8, 26 according to thy wil, that we may be heard 1. Ioh. 5, 14. and make thou intercession for vs, with sighes that cannot be expressed.
               O thou clenser of the hart, giue vnto vs the simplicitie of minde without gal and bitternes, which descendedst Matt. 3, 16. Mark. 1, 10. in Iordan vpon our Lorde and Sauior Christ in the likenes of a doue Luk. 3, 22. that we may be void of Iam. 3, 14. bitter enuie, and contention in our harts; and haue no roote Deu. 29, 18 Actes. 8, 23. among vs, that bringeth forth gal and wormewood.
               O thou substantial flame proceeding from the brest of the Father and his eternal Sonne, lighten our harts with the fire of chaste &amp; burning loue: thou which apperedst at the feast of Pentecost vnto the Apostles in clouen tongues Actes. 2, 3. like fire; see vnto our coldnes, and comfort



vs with thy quickening heate and breathings, that we may receiue thy chrisme 1. Iohn, 2, ve. 20, &amp; 27. and annointment.
               O thou ghest of the soule, make thee a mansion place within the secret parts of our harts; that we may be an house for thy diuinitie 1. Cor. 3, 16 1. Cor. 6, 19. which may dwel perpetuallie in our members, and neuer depart from vs, through our Lorde and Sauior Christ,
               Amen.
            
            
               3. A praier for a stedfast hope.
               
               
                  BLessed be God 2. Cor. 1, 3. Ephes 1, 3. euen the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ which according to his abundant mercie 1. Pet. 1, 3. hath begotten vs againe vnto a liuelie hope by the resurrection of his Sonne from the dead to an inheritance immortal, and vndefiled, and4. that vadeth not away, reserued in heauen for such as beleeue on him, through the confession of the truth, which is according to godlines Titus. 1, 1. vnder the hope of eternal life, which God, Nom. 23, verse. 19. that cannot lie, hath



promised, before the world began.
               For Rom. 8, 24 we are saued by hope. But hope that is seene is no hope. For how can a man hope for that which he seeth? But if we hope for that we25. see not, we doe with patience abide for it.
               For such is the wil of almightie God, that we shal not haue saluation as long as we are here in this world, but onelie in hope, nourishing the same as it were clasped in our armes: but then we shal perceiue the same in deede, when we depart from hence one daie.
               For hope is the vnseparable companion of Faith. For how can that be hoped for, which is not beleeued? And this hope depending vpon the promise of God is so certaine, as if the thing it selfe were present. For God which hath promised to vs saluation, is truth Iohn. 14, ve. 6, 16, 26.; and can neither deceaue, nor be deceaued.
               Wherefore we beseech thee, O eternal Father, autor Rom. 15, verse. 13. of hope and comfort, fil vs with al ioie and peace in beleeuing, that we may abounde in hope, through the power of the



holie Ghost, and aboue hope Rom. 4, 18. in hope beleeuing may neuer doubt of thy promises, but in a sure confidence of hart applie to our selues the remission of sinnes, and verilie beleue that we please thee through Christ, looking in a certaine and strong hope, through sufferance for the saluation of our soules in the life to come.
               And albeit the helpes of our happines appeare not in this world, yet let vs retaine a stedfast hope amōg al the terrors and feares of conscience; and neuer suffer the same to be taken from vs by any snares of Satan: but expecting Titus. 2, 13. that blessed appearing of the glorie of the mightie God, and of our Sauior Christ, which hath giuen himselfe for vs, alwaies fasten the same vpon the good things absent and to come.
               O thou onelie begotten Sonne of God which hast loued vs 2. Thes. 2, verse. 16., and giuen vs euerlasting comfort &amp; hope through grace, comfort our harts, &amp; establish vs in euery word and good17. worke; that we stick not vncertaine, neither be tossed betweene hope &amp; feare, but may hold fast Hebr. 3, 6. the confidence.

                  gedst thy selfe downe from the hiest top of glorie to vtter shame, putting on our flesh, thy Maiestie being hid and dissembled for a time. And so becamest thou obedient vnto thy Father not onelie in obeieng him with greater reuerence than anie other creature else did: but also in offering vp thy selfe a sacrifice for sinnes, thereby to redeeme vs being bondslaues through pride vnto sin and death, &amp; to exalt vs to an hope of eternal life; and withal by thine example to teach vs, and to propose an example of true lowlines, and humilitie, saieng Matth 11, verse. 29., Learne of me, for I am meeke, and lowlie in hart:
               We beseech thee through thine humilitie and passion, giue vnto vs a contrite spirit, a Psa. 51, 17. contrite and an humbled hart, which thou despisest not, O Lord. For thou art neere vnto al them Psa. 34, 18. which are of a trobled hart, and wilt saue such as are humble in spirit. Thou regardest their praiers, &amp; giuest to them thy grace, and thy secrets Eccl. 3, 20. are reuealed vnto the lowlie.
               Grant therfore that we following thy footesteps may humble our



selues from the hart without hypocrisie.
               Turne our harts that they be not wickedlie humbled, Ecc. 19, 25 after the maner of hypocrites, which bow themselues, and are sad casting downe their faces towards the earth, whose inward parts notwithstanding are ful of deceit.
               O God, holie Ghost, which art the ruler of our mindes, and the giuer of good gifts; which not onelie commendest, but also commandest vs to haue benignitie Col. 3, 12., lowlines, modestie, and patience that being clothed therewithal we may endeuour to facion our selues after thee, thinking modestlie and soberlie of our selues:
               Gouerne thou our minds, that we may be subiect one to another, not onelie honoring, but also preuenting Rom. 12, ve. 10, &amp; 16. one another in dooing the same; and alwaies applieng our selues to humilitie, may seeke thy glorie, and the profit of our neighbor.
               Let neither pride Iob. 4, vers. 13, &amp;c. nor luxuriousnes haue dominion either in our sence or speech; neither let vs lift vp



our pecocks feathers, nor extol our eielids through arrogancie; neither glorie in proude and vaine opinions Phili. 2, 3. Rom. 12, 10.: but by humblenes of minde, submitting our selues one to another, may thinke others better than our selues, and consider what our condition is. For man taken from the earth must returne vnto the same, and be the heire Ecc. 10, 12. of wormes and serpents.
               Especiallie our request is, that we be not puffed vp in spiritual gifts: remooue arrogancie &amp; pride from vs, that our harts Psal. 131, 1. be not lifted vp, nor yet our eies exalted; neither let vs wade in greater &amp; higher things than becommeth vs; cause vs2. to frame and tame our minds like a child newlie weaned, which is lowly with his mother. Let our minds be weaned like a childe Matt. 18, 3. knowing not what pride meanes.
               Keepe the prowde diuel that he prouoke vs not to sinne, nor to swel vp through a vaine perswasion of fleshlie righteousnes, neither wickedlie to boast of thy gifts, abusing them to our owne glorie, and contempt of others.
               
                  Suffer vs not to seeme wise Esai. 5, 21. in our owne eies. Amende this vice ingraffed in vs by nature, that no man loue or like himselfe too wel; and in respect of himself contemne others, hauing not the like, or not so excellent gift as he hath.
               Suffer not good wits, &amp; teachers armed with publike auctoritie to be pricked and tickled with the spurs of pride &amp; curiositie to the moouing of idle questions, and disputations, either through ambition or hatred. For that is not the wisedome descending from aboue: but earthlie, Iam. 3, 15. sensual, and diuelish. For Iam. 3, 16. where emulation and strife is, there is sedition and al manner of euil works.
               Grant therefore that al of vs being humble may be exalted to eternal life,
               Amen.
            
            
               5. A praier for wedded folkes.
               
               
                  O Most holie God, and mercisul father, which of thy singular prouidence, and woonderful wisedome diddest



ordaine matrimonie in Paradyse Gen. 2, 24., and that in the time of innocencie, for the multiplieng and conseruation of mankinde: thereby to gather vnto thy selfe continuallie out of godlie families, an holie catholike church which may rightly acknowledge, serue, and celebrate thine holie name for euermore, and deliuer the true vnderstanding of thee vnto posterities by one generation to another.
               This thine institution did thy Sonne, God coequal with thee and coeternal, confirme and adorne in Cana of Galile by turning water Iohn. 2, 8. into good wine. A notable honoring of mariage doubtles for Christ not onlie to be present himselfe at the nuptial feast, but also to set out the same with the first myracle that he wrought after his natiuitie.
               Likewise thy holie Spirit doth witnes by the worde deliuered vnto vs, and saith, that Heb. 13, 4. mariage is honorable among al. And the same thy Spirit reioiceth in three things Eccl. 25, 1. which are commended both before God and man, in the concorde of brethren, in the loue of neighbors,



and in a man and wife that agree wel together For such as be at variance can neither cal vpon thee as they should, nor please thee as they ought.
               O eternal God it is sufficientlie apparent, with what a rage and insatiable hatred, Satan, the most deadlie enimie to al thy works, doth labour and set himselfe to the breaking of, and ouerthrow of this thy sacred ordinance.
               Wherefore, we beseech thee, impart thy fauor vnto al maried folks, that they may acknowledge thee to be the autor and institutor of this knitting together in wedlock; and knowe and beleeue stedfastlie that they are in a good estate, wherein they may please thee through christ thy Sonne.
               For hauing this comfort they wil more willinglie and cheerefully discharge the duties of their calling in true confidence, and calling vpon thy Name. But such as doubt of their kinde of life, hauing their conscience wounded, &amp; trobled minds, can neither cal vpon thee truelie, nor cheerefullie go about, and finish



their affaires.
               Grant therefore vnto al and euerie married bodie, that in true faith and confession they may retaine the indissoluble chaine of wedded state, and the strong bonds of godly fellowship: that they may loue one another, and in the sweate of their browes Gen. 3, 19. eate their bread; and bring vp their children Ephes. 6, 4. in al godlines, through instruction, and information of the Lorde, and neuer feare the crosse which accompanieth this kinde of life.
               Worke so that Satan by no meanes weaken and ouerthrowe this thine ordinance; nor that married folkes, wearied with the trobles of wedded life, raise mortal hatred among themselues, and so detest and abhor this thine holie institution, &amp; seeke vnlawful diuorcements. For by this engine of incredulitie, and snare of mistrust being comprehended, they wil easilie rush headlong into enormous offences by casting of the yoke of the Lorde, and be carried through dissention into horrible cō
                  fusions of concupiscence, to adulterie, whoredome, wicked forsakings,



so long, til polluted with filthie spots, and defiled with most horrible staines they bring themselues hedlong into euerlasting torments. Grant therefore, O most merciful God, that al at debate may come to amitie, and be reconciled in thy Name, and, being mindful of the knot of mariage, and mutual bond betweene them, may dwel and liue peaceablie together in true faith, and feare of thy Name:
               That husbands 1. Cor. 7, 3., abusing their auctoritie, doe not exercise tyrannie ouer their wiues, but rather loue them, and dwel with them according to knowledge 1. Pet. 3, 7., giuing honor vnto them as vnto the weaker vessels, euen as to them which are also heires of grace and life:
               Likewise that matrones contemne not their husbands, denieng subiection, but rather studie by chaste obedience, and holie conuersation and lowlines to ouercome them.
               Let neither hate other extremelie, and so violate the state of mariage, and bring themselues out of thy fauor, through their discorde and contention, wherby their praiers be



interrupted. For where neither part doe their dutie, there must needes ensue first pouertie, subtiltie, lieng, and al impietie: afterward a wounded conscience; and last of al vtter despaire.
               O most chaste God, which didst therefore institute the order of matrimonie, that by the same both the weake nature of mankinde might liue purelie in lawful wedlock, and an holie Church be gathered vnto thy selfe: giue thy blessing to al which are married, that they may haue godlie children, &amp; their wiues Psa. 128, 3. proue like the fruiteful vine, and their children appere like the oliue branches round about their table, and may see their childers children,6. the peace &amp; safetie of the Church, the which, Christ thy Sonne repairer of mankind by taking our flesh vpon him, hath copled to himselfe, which liueth and raigneth with thee in the vnitie of the holie Spirit a God for euermore,
               Amen.

                  OMost merciful God, and eternal Father, which out of the mouth of babes Psal. 8, 2. and sucklings hast ordained strength of thy praise; and wilt also Ps. 148, 12. that yong men and maidens, old men and children should praise thee the eternal God, in true confessing, inuocating, and celebrating of thy diuine maiestie through al generations for euermore:
               Thou hast enioined vnto children that they shewe Exo. 20, 12 Deutr. 5, 16. Matth. 15, 4. Ephes. 6, 2. Colos. 3, 20. Mark. 7, 10. Eccles. 3, 9. due honor, subiection, and reuerence to their parents, and obeie them willinglie in al good and lawful things:
               We beseech thee, on the behalfe of al infants, children, and yonger sort, as wel maidens, as of the malekind, implant in them a true fear o
                     •
                   thy Name, that from their youth they may confesse thee Ioh. 17, 3. to be the onelie true God, and Iesus whom thou hast sent to be Christ; and encrease daily in this wholesōe knowledge,



profiting as in yeeres Luk. 2, 52. so in fauor both before thee and men.
               Let them not cast of the yoake of obedience and subiection, neither yet abuse the gentlenes of their parents and elders vnto libertie of sinning, nor by their hardnes and austeritie conceaue an hatred against them, and refuse their correction: but make them pacientlie to take the warnings and discipline of their parents in good part, to the glorie of thy Name, and saluation of their owne soules.
               O Christ, louer of mankind, which cōmandest children Luk. 18. 16 Matt. 19, 14. Marke. 10, ve. 14, &amp; 16. to be brought vnto thee, and receiuing them into thine armes, in token of a singular and deere good wil, laieng thine hands vpon them didst blesse them:
               We beseech thee, which for our sakes wast borne an infant, and didst shed thy most innocent blood vpon the altar of the crosse, aswel for infants as for elder folkes; blesse thou al infants, and children; impart thy grace vpon them, that they may feare thee, and haue their parents in great reuerence, according to thy wil, which is a most certaine rule of



al iustice and vprightnes.
               Keepe them therefore that they be not infected with false doctrine, and superstitious seruice; neither yet seduced from true religion through wicked and vngodlie behauior.
               Preserue them from wicked companie, and filthie felowship, which as contagion and leauen 1. Cor. 5, 6. Galat. 5, 9. ouercometh and pearceth the whole lumpe; keepe them from riotousnes &amp; dronkennes; from wandring concupiscence; from idlenes, which ministreth matter and nourishment vnto al vices.
               Remooue awaie al shameful examples, and take awaie al offences Matt. 18, 6. Mark. 9, 42. Luke. 17, 2. that the yonger sort beholding the multitude of sinners, follow not the steps of the wicked, and without feare enter into their most abhominable waies.
               Giue vnto al yong scholers a good wit to conceiue, a good capacitie to vnderstand, and a good memorie to beare awaie good lessons, and to learne from their infancie those things, which may instruct them to saluatiō 
                  2. Tim. 2, 10 by faith which is in Christ



Iesus. For euerie scripture 2. Tim. 3, verse. 16. giuen by the inspiration of God, is profitable to teach, to reproue, to correct, and to instruct in righteousnes that the man of God may be absolute being instructed to al good works. The entrance into thy words Psal. 119, verse. 130. giueth light to the blinde, and vnderstanding to the simple.
               Grant therefore that from their youth Ps. 119, 9▪
                   they may exercise themselues in thy commandements. For the first institution doth much good, yea, Pro. 22, 6. the whole race of their life afterward dependeth vpon the same.
               O God the holie Ghost, which workest by thy worde and sacraments, and thereby gatherest vnto thy selfe a Church, not onelie from the elder sort, but also from the yonger, wee beseech thee maintaine scholes and scholers, which are the seede of thy Church, and direct their studies vnto the honor of thy glorious Name.
               Turne the harts of youth to the loue of true doctrine and virtue: wherby they may come to good behauior in manners, and to sounde



learning of minde.
               Maintaine the scholes wherin the tongues and sciences are taught, which thou hast reuealed vnto mankinde as necessarie helpes to teach withal; that so the pure sound of thine heauenlie doctrine may be heard and retained in the true and right Congregation.
               And forasmuch as the verie cogitations Gen. 6, 5. Genes. 8, 21. Matt. 15, 19. of mans hart are euil euen from his youth; and our nature, through the fal of our first parents euen frō our yong yeares is corrupted, and prone to al wickednes, that easily it cānot be brought vnder the subiection of another. For Pro. 22, 5. foolishnes is bound in the hart of a childe:
               Giue them wisedome and learning, that they doe not delight in wicked affections, and so grow on in malice and stubbornes, waxing wild and resisting godlie and honest admonitions, and that, being become vnbridled, sauage, vntrectable, and past learning, they proue not obstinate in wickednes &amp; disobedience; but make them through thine instinct to learne and embrace thy commandements, and to binde thy



law Pro. 6, 21. continually about their harts, and tie it about their necks, that thy grace &amp; gift may encrease by grace, vntil, growing to mans estate, they become profitable instruments of thy Church, and teachers of righteousnes, and abide conioined vnto thee, which liuest and raignest a God worlds without ende,
               Amen.

                  O Lord IESV Christ, Sonne of the almightie God: great is the rage Reu. 12, 12. Iohn. 14, 30. and tyrannie of the Diuel, which being strong and armed Luk. 11, 21. Reue. 16, 14. keepeth his court to possesse the same in peace, and to augment his kingdome of darkenes, wherein reigneth horrible Idolatrie, hatred of thy truth, &amp; diuers abhominable worshipings, with al kinde of shameful transgressions, &amp; most outragious wickednes.
               Lamentable also is the wretched blindnes, and obstinate malice of those men, which suffer themselues to be ruled by Satan, and follow the beast Reu. 13, 3. vnto al kind of impietie. In



whom the God of this world 2. Cor. 4, 4 hath blinded the mindes of Infidels, that the light of thy glorious Gospel, which is the image of God, should not shine in them. But are held captiue 2. Timo.

                     , verse. 26. Romanes. 1, vers. 24. &amp;c. at the Diuels pleasure, whose harts he doth possesse, and is mightie in the children of darkenes, so that subduing the natural powers, hee carrieth them into horrible wickednes; which indeede, after such a beastlie rage, and so furiouslie woulde not rush into al filthie and vile wickednes, were they not driuen therevnto through the force of Satan, which carrieth them hether &amp; thether as he list like bondslaues, vntil at length they fal vnto blaspheming of thy most holie Name: so that conuicted of their owne conscience they impugne, and mortallie pursue thy word of purpose committing therby the sinne against the holie Ghost.
               For when wittinglie and of purpose they denie the manifest and knowen truth of God through obstinate malice and voluntarie stubbornes, and persist impenitent, they become blasphemers of God. Because



wittinglie and maliciouslie, euen against their conscience, they cal Esai. 5, 20. good, euil, and euil they affirme to be good, putting light for darknes, and darknes for light.
               There is none hope of the forgiuenes of this sinne. Such sacriledge is not forgiuen Mat. 12, 31 Mark. 3, 29. Luk. 12, 10. 1. Ioh. 5, 16. neither in this world nor in the world to come. Because they conuert the onelie remedie of saluation into deadlie poison, and with an affected ignorance they continue in manifest impietie against their conscience.
               And therefore they cannotlaie the fault of their wickednes vpon others: because not against, but with their wils they prostitute themselues before the Diuel, and obeie the Prince of darknes with al redines of minde; and studie without repentance to drawe others vnto euerlasting perdition by the example of their wicked life.
               O Christ, King of glorie, which art stronger Luk. 11, 22 than the Diuel, and hast spoiled him of al his armor wherin he trusted. Thou hast brused in peeces that monstrous Leuiathan Iob. 40, 20 of an huge &amp; woonderful bignes; and



brought vnder feete the mightie &amp; strong Goliath 1. Sam. 17, ver. 4, &amp; 10. which obraided thine host: We beseech thee, shewe forth thy power and bring the Diuel vnder our feete Rom. 16. verse. 20., destroie his kingdome, that we runne not into the sinne of blasphemie, neither go about to extinguish in our selues the light of the holie Ghost, nor kick against the same.
               O thou mightie Gigant, which hast cast headlong into hel the very Angels which sinned 2. Pe. 2, 4., bound with the chaines of darknes, so to take from them al power, that they rule not ouer the faithful, and holy ones: take vs out of the floud of heresies, and prophane opinions: and suffer vs not to be drowned in the lake Reue. 21, 8. burning with fire and brimstone.
               O Christ the leader vnto life, which dieng diddest destroie our death, and by rising againe repaire our life: take vs vnto thee, that being ingraffed, and vnited to thy body we may be neuer separated from thee our head. And quicken vs being once dead Ephes. 2, vers. 11, &amp;c. through sin, wherin we walked according to the custome of this world, after him which



is Prince of the aire, and worketh in these daies within the children of vnbeleefe, among whom we our selues also walked sometime in the concupiscence of our flesh, doing those things which delighted our sences and fantasies. For by nature we were the sonnes of wrath, euen as others.
               But now thou, O God, which art rich in mercie, for thy great kindnes sake wherewith thou louest vs: gouerne vs by thine holie Spirit, that we neuer forsake the faith which thou hast giuen vs, but perseuering in the rase begunne, may attaine through thy grace to the saluation of our soules.
               Take awaie from vs that which is deformed by our corrupt nature, &amp; continue that which thy grace hath wrought within vs, that sin Rom. 6, 12 raigne not in our mortal bodies, neither we obeie it in the vnlawful lustes therof. Assist vs with thine aide that being deliuered from sinne Rom. 6, 13., we may be the seruants of righteousnes, and obeie that doctrine from the hart wherevnto we are brought, giuing our members, seruants of



righteousnes vnto sanctification: so shal we serue thee our true GOD here in the kingdome of grace, herafter in the kingdome of glorie, which liuest with God the Father and the holie Ghost for euermore,

               1. On VVensdaie, Morning praier.
               
               
                  O Almightie, and merciful GOD, which gauest the people of Israël in charge Exo. 29, 38 Num. 28, 3. 1. Chr. 16, 37 2. Chr. 13, 11. euerie daie both in the morning and at night to offer vnto thee a burnt offering for a sweete sauor in thine eares, that thereby they might glorifie thee and giue thee thankes for the benefite of their protection both night and daie: rising this morning we offer vp vnto thee the sacrifice of thankesgiuing Psa. 50, 14. 23..
               We glorifie thee, O eternal God, for breaking the chaines Ps. 116, 16. of the darknes of this night. We wil offer17. vnto thee a sacrifice of praise, and cal vpon thy Name.
               We wil praise our God Ps. 107, 14. which brought vs out of darknes and the shadowe of death, and brake the bonds wherewith we were tied this night; he hath deliuered our soules from perils by bringing vs safe and sound to the morning light.
               
                  Wherefore we offer before thee the calues of our lips Hose. 14, 3. for a morning sacrifice, and with our tongues doe we praise thee, O Lord.
               Our mouthes Psal. 71, 8. shal be filled with thy praise, and with thy glorie euerie daie.
               Our tongues shal talke of thy righteousnes Ps. 35, 28. Psal. 71, 24. and saluation euerie daie.
               Our lips shal speake of thy praise Psal. 119, verse. 171., and our tongues shal entreate of thy worde.
               Our soules shal be filled as it were with fatnes Psal. 36, 8.; and with the lips of reioicing shal our mouth extol thee.
               We wil praise thy Name with songs Psa. 69, 30. and magnifie thee with thankesgiuing, which please thee better than either oxe or calfe that31. hath hornes and hooues.
               Wherefore let the sacrifice of our mouthes Psa. 19, 14. which we offer vnto thee now this morning, and the meditations of our hares be grateful in thy sight.
               O Lorde, we beseech thee Psal. 119, verse. 108. accept the free offerings of our mouth and teach vs thy iudgements, that we may doe thy wil according to



thy good pleasure.
               Vnto thee, O Lorde, we wil crie Psa. 88, 13. and earelie shal our praiers come before thee.
               In this morning doe we beseech thee by the resurrection of our Lord Iesu Christ thy welbeloued Sonne, that, as he was raised Rom. 6, 4. Colos. 2, 12. Ephes. 1, 20. from the dead by thy glorie: so thou wilt raise and lift vs vp this morning, that rising out of the filth of sinne, and leauing the beds of vnrighteousnes, we may put on the newe man which is renued in knowledge Col. 3. 10. after the image of thee Gen. 1, 26. Genes. 5, 1. Genes. 9, 6. which didst create him, and giue not ouer our selues to sleepe and snorting.
               Awake now our soules Ephe. 5, 11. which sleepe; rise from the dead, &amp; Christ wil lighten yee.
               For certes it is hie time that we should arise from sleepe Rom. 13, 11 the houre of our watching being nigh, and our saluation neerer than when we beleeued. The night is passed, and the12. day is at hand. Grant therfore merciful God, that casting of the works13. of darknes, and putting on the armour of light we may walke honestlie as in the daie, not in gluttonie,



and drunkennes Luk. 21, 34 Galat. 5, 16. 1. Pet. 2, 11.

                     . Pet. 3, 16., neither in chambering and wantonnes, nor in strife and enuieng, but may put on our Lord Iesu Christ by true faith, and good works which may smel of him, that tasting of his sweetenes, at no time we may be separated frō him.
               Wherefore we beseech thee, O Lord, continue thy goodnes toward vs, and grant that al our praiers and workes may both begin from thee, and ende through thee.
               Vouchsafe, O Lord, to keepe vs this day without sinne. Let thy mercie be vpon vs Psa. 33, 22. as we trust in thee.
               O Lord, keepe our tongues from euil Psa. 34, 13., and our lips that they speake no guile.
               Remoue from vs al filthy speech 1. Pet. 3, 10. Ephes. 5, 12. Ephes. 4, 25. Coloss. 3, 8. 1. Peter. 2, 1. Eccle. 23, 7., vanitie of wordes, and al scurrilitie, that we blab out nothing rashlie, or vndiscreetelie to the hurt of our neighbour.
               Who shal set a locke vpon our mouth, and a sure seale vpon our lips? that we offende not in our speech, that our tongues do not destroie vs.
               Omnipotent GOD, put thou a watch vpon our mouth Ecc. 28, 24 Psal. 141, 3. &amp; a doore



vpon our lips, that our mouth transgresse not, neither our lips be opened to speake that is vnseemelie; that our mouthes may meditate vpon the truth Prouer.

               Grant merciful GOD, that descending into our soules we may reprehende and condemne the spots, and vices within vs, and not, forgetting our selues, iudge others, and therby fal into thy dreadful iudgements.
               O Lorde, deliuer vs from lieng lips, Ps. 120, 2. and from a deceitful tongue, whose mouth Psa. 55, 21. is softer than butter, and their words more gentle than oile, and are most pearcing dartes. They haue sharpened their tonges like serpents Psa. 140, 3. Rom. 3, 13. the poison of aspes is vnder their lips. Keepe vs, O Lord, both now and euermore.
               Sende thy word Ps. 107, 20. and heale vs, Lord, through our Sauior Christ thy beloued Sonne,
               Amen.
            
            
               
               2. A thankesgiuing for the knowledge of God.
               
               
                  WE giue thee thanks, O Father, Lord of heauen &amp; earth, Matth. 11, vers. 25, &amp;c. because thou hast hid the mysterie of thy worde, which is the Gospel of our saluation by thy Sonne, from the wise, and men of vnderstanding in this world, and hast reuealed the same to babes of base degree: certainlie such was thy good pleasure.
               Thou hast giuen vs al things in thy Sonne, whom none knoweth but thou Father; neither doth any knowe thee except thy Sonne, and he to whom thy Sonne shal reueale thee.
               We worship thee, we praise thee, we glorifie thee, we giue thee thāks for the hid wisedome 1. Cor. 2, 7. which thou didst determine before the worlde, for our glorie, which was neuer knowne to the Princes of this world, nor at any time to the sonnes of men, as it is now reuealed by the Spirit, to knowe the communion of



the mysterie, which was hid from al ages Col. 1, 26. Rom. 16, 25 Titus. 1, 3. 1. Pet. 1, 20. Ephesian. 3, verse. 3, &amp;c. but is nowe opened to thy Saints, to whom thou woldest haue made knowen, what be the riches of this glorious mysterie.
               It is thine owne working, and of thy free mercie that we are made heires and partakers of the promise in Christ Iesu through the Gospel, which bringeth vs tydings, and assurance of the euerlasting riches of thine infinit goodnes and mercie.
               Blessed be God▪ 
                  Ephes. 1, 3. euen the Father of our Lord Iesu Christ, which hath blessed vs with al spiritual blessings4. in heauenlie things by Christ, and hath chosen vs in him before the foundations of the worlde, that we shoulde be holie 2. Tim. 1, 9 Colos. 1, 22. Luke. 1, 75. and without blame before him by loue, who hath predestinated vs Ephes. 1, 5. to be adopted through Iesus Christ vnto himselfe, according to the good pleasure of his wil, whereby he loueth vs by his6. beloued, in whom we haue redemption by his blood, euen the forgiuenes7. of sinnes, according to the riches8. of his grace, wherin he hath abounded towarde vs in al wisedome



and vnderstanding, &amp; hath openedEphes. 1, 9. vnto vs the mysterie of his wil according to his good pleasure, which he had purposed in himselfe, euen vntil the dispensation of the fulnes10. of time, that he might gather in one al things, both which are in heauen and which are in earth, euen in Christ, by whom also we are chosen11. when we were predestinated according to the purpose of him which maketh al things after the counsel of his owne wil, that we might be to12. the praise of his glory which hoping haue beleeued in Christ when we13. heard the worde of truth, euen the Gospel of saluation.
               And this grace thou didst extend toward vs, not by the works of righteousnes Titus. 3, 5. which we had done, but according to thy mercie thou sauedst vs, and diddest cal vs with an holie calling, not according to our works 2. Tim. 1, 9. but according to thine owne purpose and grace, which was giuen to vs through Christ before al times, and is now made manifest by10. the appearing of our Sauior Iesus Christ, which hath abolished death, and brought life and immortalitie



vnto light through the Gospel.
               To thee therefore Rom. 16, verse. 25. which art of power to establish our harts according to the reuelation of the mysterie which was kept secret since the world began, (but now is opened,26. and published among al nations by the scriptures of the Prophets, at the commandement of the euerlasting GOD for the obedience of faith) to thee, we saie, God onelie27. wise, be praise through Iesu Christ for euer, Amen.
               We beseech thee, that according to the operation Eph. 1, 19. Ephes. 3, 7. and working of thy mightie power, we may continue constant in true faith and wholsome doctrine, and at no time, forsaking the wisedome opened in the Gospel, may follow the iudgement of worldlie reason, and fleshlie vnderstanding Mat. 16, 17. which thou hast besotted, and altogether confounded in searching thy hidden mysteries.
               For that spiritual wisdome Col. 1, 10. doth far exceede al wisedome and vnderstanding of the creatures, whervnto flesh cannot attaine, neither can our blood reueale, nor yet the natural man 1. Cor. 2, verse. 14. although he be endued



with great sharpnes of wit, and worldlie vnderstanding, perceiue the same.
               Grant we beseech thee, that we may be thy simple, and little ones 2. Cor. 10, verse. 5. receiuing from thee the worde of truth without contradition and disputation, and that in the articles of faith wee bring not fleshlie wisedome, but, being made voide of our proper vnderstanding may bring our mindes into a godlie captiuitie.
               Let thy Sonne, which descending from about brought with him the eternal wisdome of the Gospel from thy bosome, and was made a sacrifice on our behalfe, but now exalted to thy right hande bestoweth his gifts Eph. 4, 8. 1. Cor. 12, 28 Ephes. 4, 11., let him, we beseech thee shine in our harts.
               Likewise cause thine holie Spirit to instil into vs his diuine light, and breath vpon vs the newe flame of thine heauenlie knowledge, til departing into the eternal life we may beholde thee the onelie and true God face to face, which liuest and raignest in perpetual glorie,

Roman. 5, 8. louing vs euen to the ende, and thereby didst suffer a cruel death vpon the altar of the crosse to deliuer vs from euerlasting death, and perpetual torments, and to allure vs by that thine example to amitie. That as thy wil was to suffer death on our behalfe: so we hauing the riches of this worlde, shoulde be so far from keeping back our almes and reliefe from the poore, 1. Ioh. 3, 17 Iame. 2, 15. or shutting vp our bowels of compassion frō them, that in the case of necessitie, we should giue our liues 1. Ioh 3, 16 for our brethren.
               For both our profession requireth the same, and it is the token whereby the true Christians are knowen, according to thy worde Ioh. 13, 35. 1. Iohn. 4, 2

being banished 1. Cor. 13, 1 al other gifts are corrupt and profite nothing.
               We besech thee by thine hote burning, and abundant loue, enflame our cold harts with the affection of vnfained good wil, that we may loue thee Deut. 6, 5. Mark. 12, 30 33. Luk. 10, 27. the Father, and the holie Spirit in one eternal and inseperable essence, aboue al things with our whole hart, with al our soule, and with al our strength; and keepe that commandement which againe &amp; peculiarlie thou didst commend vnto vs, saieng Ioh. 13, 34▪ 1. Iohn. 2, 8., A new commandement giue I vnto you, that yee loue one another: as I haue loued you, that euen so ye loue one another. Thou likewise, O Sonne of God, when thy death was nigh didst beg, that the loue Ioh. 17, 26. where with the eternal Father loueth thee, may be in thy seruants,
               Expresse in vs the similitude of thy good wil, and turne vs into such a shape, that our soules, by the light 2. Cor. 3, verse. 18. and motion of the holie Spirit may be coupled with thine eternal Father; and that the image of like integritie 2. Cor. 4, 6 Colos. 1, 12., knowledge, righteousnes, and affections may shine in vs, as



doth in thee, which art the brightnes of the eternal Father in the most pleasant and perpetual harmonie. Raise vp in vs a desire of brotherlie and entire good wil, that euery one may haue a care to helpe his brother; euen as members of one bodie Rom. 12, 4. 1. Cor. 12, 12. haue a mutual compassion ech of other, so we may loue among our selues vnfainedlie, and abounde in mutual friendship one towards another, that our harts may be confirmed, and vnblameable in holines before God.
               Giue grace that our loue may be perfect, wanting no part due vnto the same, not fained Rom. 12, 9 false, or hypocritical, not waiward, tedious, disdainful, nor hunting after profit.
               Grant therefore that we may abhor10. that which is euil, and be affectioned to loue one another with brotherlie loue. Make vs patient 1. Cor. 13. verse. 4., bountiful, not enuious, no boasters, not puffed vp, not proud, no seekers5. of our owne, not easie to be moued vnto anger, no thinkers of euil, no6. reioicers in wickednes but reioicers in the truth; to suffer al things, beleeue7. al things, hope al things, and



so to loue one another mutuallie 1. Ioh. 3, 18 not in word and tong onlie, but in deede and truth; not abusing christian libertie Gal. 5, 13. as an occasion vnto the flesh, but by loue to serue one another.
               Inflame our brests, that after thine example 1. Pet. 2, 21 we may vnfeinedlie loue euen our verie enimies Mat. 5, 44. and blesse them that cursse vs; doe good vnto them which hate and hurt vs, leauing reuengement Rom. 12, 19 Deu. 32, 35. Eccles. 28, 1. alwaies to thee.

For he which loueth not his brother 1. Ioh. 3, 14 Iames. 3, 14. knoweth not God, but abideth in death, and doth vainlie boast against the truth.
               Grant therefore to vs which are translated 1. Ioh. 3, 14 from death to life, that retaining the studie of concord Colos. 3, 8. we may loue one another, and put away bitter emulation, forgiuing al13. men euen from the hart, euen as thou hast forgiuen vs.
               Let not the sunne go downe vpon our wrath, Eph. 4, 26. 27. giuing place to the Diuel, but let vs be quiet, Colo. 3, 12. putting on



tender mercie, kindnes, humblenesColoss. 3, 14. of minde, meekenes, and aboue al, charitie, which is the bond of perfection, the ende of the commandement 1.

                  O Eternal Father, maker &amp; gouernor of al the worlde, from the bottome of our harts we thanke thee Eph. 5, 20. in the Name of our Lord Iesu Christ, for that thou hast not vtterlie cast away mankinde hauing fallen from the state of paradise by sinne, into euerlasting damnation, as thou didst the Diuels: but of thine vnspeakeable goodnes, through thy secret counsaile wouldest nedes that thy Sonne should take our flesh vpon him, be a mediator betweene thee and vs, and be sacrificed for our sinnes 1. Tim. 2, 5▪
                  :
               For, thou wilt not the death of a sinner, neither art thou delighted Ezech. 18, verse. 23. in the destruction of the wicked, but that he repent and liue.
               Againe, thy Sonne came not to



cal the righteous, but sinners to repentance Mat. 9, 13..
               We beseech thee on the behalfe of al sinners; for al in bondage to Satan; and for as many as are ouerwhelmed in wickednes, grant them grace, merciful God, that they may escape the snares of the Diuel, and acknowledge their offences; strike into them a feare of thine indignation, and paines of hel, that their minds be not darkned Eph. 4, 18. and so they become strangers from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardnes of their hart: &amp; that they come not to19. that passe that they forsake al sorrowing, &amp; so giue themselues to cō
                  mit wantonnes euen with gredines.
               For they which breake thy precepts wilfullie, and haue no feare nor feeling of thy iudgements, but runne on securelie, pleasing themselues, &amp; taking pleasure in their impietie; whose consciences do soundlie sleepe (the feare of thy iudgement being cleane extinguished in them) and prostitute themselues to al vncleannes, they heape vnto themselues the wrath of God Rom. 2, 5. according



to their hardnes, and harts which cannot repent, &amp; giue themselues ouer into reprobate mindes Rom. 1, 28 to doe those things as be vncomelie, being ful of al vnrighteousnes, fornication, wickednes, couetousnes,29. malice, ful of enuie, of murther, of debate, of deceipt, corrupted in manners, whisperers; backbyters,30. haters of God, dooers of wrong, proude, boasters, inuenters of euil things, disobedient to parents, without vnderstanding, breakers of promises, far from al charitable affection; yea they giue themselues wholie to the works of the flesh Gala. 5, 19., that so, forgoing al sense of godlines, they may obstinatelie go forward in wickednes to their euerlasting perdition.
               Bring them, merciful God, to thy truth, and giue them grace vnfeinedlie to repent, and to escape the snares of Satan 2. Tim. 2, 26 wherein they are intangled, and deteined at his pleasure.
               Take away stubbornes, hardnes of their minde, and this damnable securitie, that wickednes Wisd. 2, 21 doe not vtterlie blinde them.
               
                  Bestow vpon them a new hart, and put a new spirit within them, take away that stonie hart out of their flesh Eze. 36, 27 Esaie. 44▪ 3. Iere. 32, 39. and giue them a fleshie hart, and put thy spirit within their brestes.
               Merciful God, guide vs with thine holie Spirit, that bewailing our sins from the bottome of our harts, we may flie to thine vnspeakeable mercie, which thou dost promise to as manie as in faith turne vnto thee: and laieng away (as concerning the conuersation in times past) Eph. 4, 22. the old man, which is corrupt through the deceaueable lustes, may be renued23. in the spirit of our minds, and put on the newe man, which after24. God is created in righteousnes and true holines.
               Assist vs, O God, that putting away25. lieng, we may speake euery one the truth to his neighbor, because we are the members one of another; and in anger offende not.26.
               
               Let him that stoale, steale no28. more, but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may giue vnto him which needeth.
               
                  Come into our harts through thy word, and by thy Spirit begin a new and holie life; stir vp good motions agreeable to thy wil, and answering to the rule of thy worde reuealed in the congregation.
               For thou God Rom. 10, verse. 12. art rich towards, and ouer al that cal vpon thee, and repent. Yea, it is not thy wil that any of the least should perish Mat. 18, 14 but that al be saued 1. Tim. 2, 4. and come to the knowledge of the truth.
               And for this cause, no man be he neuer so wicked, ought to despaire. For it is a true saieng 1. Tim. 1, verse. 15. and by al meanes worthie to be receaued, That Christ Iesus came into the worlde to saue sinners, and so verie many, being somtime notable transgressors, haue attained mercie, for an example to such, as afterwarde16. shoulde beleeue on him to their euerlasting happines.
               Giue vs therefore, O most gentle God, peniten
                     〈…〉
                  arts, that we may throughlie examine our waies Lam. 3, 40., and trie them, and returne to thee, O Lorde: lifting vp our harts with41. our hands vnto thee which art in the heauens.
               
                  We, which haue sinned and rebelled,Lam. 3, 42. with griefe and sorrowe of hart acknowledge al our filthie faults, and with a true faith approch to the throne of thy grace, trusting in the reconciliation made by thy Sonne our propitiator, and raised vp in his faithful and infallible promise we purpose through thine assistance to begin a newe life, to the glorie and praise of thy sacred Name,
               Amen.
            
            
               6. A praier for the Sick.
               
                  O Christ, which art the virtue that is made perfect in infirmitie 2. Cor. 12, 9 the strength of the weake, the saluation of al beleeuers, an aider of the oppressed Psal. 9, 9., a refuge in the time of troble Psa. 68, 20., a physition for the sicke, yea, our life and salfegard in the peril of death:
               By al thy paines &amp; passions (which thou didst suffer for vs, and wherby in the flesh thou tookedst vppon thee Heb. 4, 15., thou feelest our infirmities) we beseech thee, that pittieng our



sicknes, and diseases, thou wilt succor al that are sicke, and especiallie such, as in their agonies do encounter with many &amp; sondrie tentations.
               Giue them grace to know that al sicknes and miseries of the bodie whatsoeuer come not by chance, but to be sent of thee our God; without whose wil and permission none aduersitie can come vpon vs. For Mat. 10, 30 al the heares of our heads be nombred.
               Let them knowe that sicknes is sent through thy good counsaile, not for our destruction, but for our amendment, and to cal vs vnto repentance; and either to keepe vs in our calling, or to driue vs from wickednes (whervnto by nature we are inclined) For 1 Cor. 11, verse. 32. when we are iudged we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the worlde. And iudgement commonlie beginnes 1. Pet 4, 17 at the house of God.
               Finallie diseases be certaine instruments whereby thou dost exercise vs to the mortification of our flesh.
               O thou most excellent curer both



of soules and bodies diseased, which hast showen that sicknes, and miseries of the bodie are the punishments of sinne 1. Cor. 11, verse. 30. and warnings of thy displeasure against our wickednes: Spare vs, O Lorde, spare thy people Ioël. 2, 17. and forgiue our sinnes, whereby we haue prouoked these manifold diseases and miseries.
               Speake vnto our trobled harts in this conflict of the conscience, reuiue them with the sweete and liuelie comfort of the free remission of our sinnes purchased by Christ 1. Cor. 15, 3, and take awaie the prick of sinne, and stings of death, that we feele not the gnawing worme of a guiltie conscience.
               Grant vs quiet mindes through the consolation of the scriptures Rom. 15, 4., and working of the holie Ghost, that we may surelie rest vpon thee and thy promises, neuer doubting of thy fatherlie kindnes toward vs.
               Heate our colde harts, and fainting members by thy Spirit, that they may be nimble to fulfil thy pleasure, and suffer afflictions laide vpon them, with a quiet minde; and neuer murmuringlie resist thy wil,



but alwaies thinke, that whom the Lord loueth Pro. 3, 12. Hebr. 12, 6. him he chasteneth; and scourgeth euerie sonne, that he receiueth. Therefore strengthen vs, that we may suffer thy fatherlie correction with quiet minds.
               O Lord, 1. Kin 8, 39 looke downe from heauen, from thine holie Court, and behold the humilitie and affliction of al weake persons: take from them their extreme paine, or at the least mitigate their sorrowes, whereby they may feele some ease, and let thy yoke be vnto them easie, Mat. 11, 30 and thy burden light.
               Restore the weake to their woonted strength, and heale their griefes according to thy diuine pleasure to their welfare.
               Wype away alteares Reue. 21, 4 from their eies, and helpe them on the bed of their sorow Psal 41, 3. and make their beds in their weakenes.
               Heale and bind vp their wounds, for great is thy power Psa. 147, 5. and thine hand is not shortened Esai. 50, 2.. For when al hope (of worldlie helpe) doth faile, that can assist. Thy mightie right hande Psalm. 77, vers. 10, &amp;c. can alter euery thing, yea, if thou onlie saie the word Matth. 8, verse. 8, &amp;c the



weake shal be healed, &amp; that without the means of any natural thing.
               Grant likewise that al which are recouered may wel vse their health (least otherwise they forgo through sin y• which they receiued by grace) be thankful, &amp; alwaies warie Iohn. 5, 14. least a woorse thing happen vnto them.
               And concerning such as it pleaseth thee to take out of this miserable worlde into thine euerlasting kingdome, confirme those with thine holie Spirit, that at the houre of their departure they may peaceably rest Esai. 57, 2., vpholden with a trust of free remission of their sinnes, and hope of a ioieful resurrection of the dead, and life euerlasting.
               Shorten the paines which they suffer now in their mortal bodies, and turne their sorrow into perfect and eternal ioie Ioh. 16, 20, and make them willing to be dissolued from their bodies Phili. 1, 23., &amp; to be with thee, and to withdraw themselues from al such things as doe hinder the spiritual course, as are the loue of this present life, the pleasures of the world, the desires of the flesh, earthlie cogirations, riches, and vaine glorie.
               
                  O Christ our eternal Sauior, we beseech thee, which, hauing ouercome the sting of death, hast opened the kingdome of heauen to al beleeuers, &amp; according to our faith, wilt come to be the iudge of the quick and dead, haue mercie on thy seruants whom thou hast redeemed with thy precious blood,
               Amen.
            
            
               7. A praier against the tentation of Satan.
               
               
                  O Most heauenlie Father and eternal God, vnto thee do we crie, protect &amp; strengthen vs weake and feeble ones against the tentation of Satan, which is the sworne and extreeme enimie to mans saluation, a slanderer, and our accuser, that great Dracon Reu. 12, 3., the old serpent, which is called the Diuel, carrieng away the whole world, a coosener, &amp; wicked spirit; a deceauer, which goeth about like a roaring Lion 1. Pet. 5, 8. seeking whom he may deuour.
               And especiallie in this doting age of the world, as he knoweth his time



of raigning is but short Reu. 12, 12. &amp; perceiueth the day of iudgement to be verie nigh at hand, wherein his filthines shal be made manifest to al creatures, to his euerlasting torments: so now he rageth, and raungeth in a deadlie hatred against thy flock, &amp; by al meanes seketh the destruction of al mankind, diuers waies, and by vnspeakeable subtiltie doth he laie snares to entrap our soules; egerlie doth he beset vs, and al his power and pollicie doth he powre out against vs, he prieth for any occasion, wherby he may allure vs to shameful offending, and so at length horriblie to cast vs headlong into extreeme desperation.
               For as many corporal affections as be in man, so many occasions doth he take to tempt vs, thereby to wound vs, or at least to hurt vs with one prick or other.
               He laieth snares to take vs in wealth, in pouertie, in pleasure, and in the inticements of the flesh, in anguish of minde, in ambition and desire of glorie, in the wearisomnes of our calling and inferior condition, in cares both for the back and



bellie; in couetousnes and loue of monie, in lust of reuenge.
               He ticles some with a desire of glorie and promotion; he imprinteth in others a vaine of curiositie and pride; into others he instilleth suspicions and doubtings of thy diuine wil and prouidence; he bloweth into others a perswasion of wisedome and knowledge; some he carieth awaie in securitie; night and daie whether we sleepe or wake he is about vs, &amp; with foming mouth, and open iawes, neieth to deuour vs 2. Cor. 12, verse. 7. that our senses may be corrupted from the simplicitie, which we owe to Christ, euen as the serpent deceaued Eaue by his subteltie.
               O God, who is able to flie awaie; or to persist against so diuers strokes and assaults of the Diuel?
               Vnles thou, O most mightie protector, defend vs, alas we perish.
               For thou knowest we are too weak to resist, no strength is in vs, no aid, prudence, or policie is in our nature against so strong and subtile an enimie.
               Beholde, our nature is accursed &amp; vncleane, our flesh is weake, our



life transitorie; and we, alas therefore, be cowardes and without armor, giuen to sleepe and slothfulnes Matth. 26, verse. 40. and endeuor not couragiouslie to withstand the fraudes of the Diuel.
               Wherefore expel from vs this deepe sluggishnes of ours, &amp; open the eies of our mindes that we may behold how great the power, endeuors, strength, and malice of this aduersarie is, with whom we are to encounter.
               For we wrestle not against flesh &amp; blood Ephe. 6, 12. but against rules, against powers, against gouernors, and rulers of the darknes of this world, against spiritual wickednes in heauenlie places.
               O thou Sonne of God, which art that blessed seede Gen. 3, 15. broozing the head▪ of the most subtile serpent, bring and brooze our enimie Satan vnder thy feete Rom. 16, verse. 20..
               Thou which didst appere 1. Ioh. 3, 5. to destroie the works of the Diuel, driue awaie from vs lieng Spirits, that they hurt vs not.
               Thou our chiefe champion, which of thine owne accord enteredst into



tentations Matth. 4, verse. 1, &amp;c. Mark. 1, 12. Luke. 4, 1. that so thou mightest, as it were, hand to hand wrestle with our enimie, and purchase a triumph for vs by thy victorie, hold him fast bound Reuel. 20, verse. 2, &amp;c. that he exercise not his deuises vpon vs, as he desireth: make vs partakers of thy victorie, that euen as thou in thy bodie ouer camest the diuel Mat. 4, 10.: so thou wilt vtterlie dispatch him in thy members.
               And therefore giue vnto vs thine whole armor Eph. 6, 13. that like right soldiors we may resist in the euil daie, and vanquish our enimie. Girde vs with the truth; put vpon vs the14. breast-plate of righteousnes; and let vs be shod to the propagation of15. the Gospel of peace; Aboue al things giue vs the shield of faith,16. which can extinguish al the fierie darts of wicked spirits. Bestow vpon vs the helmet of saluation, and the17. sword of the spirit, which is the word of God, that through thee we may encounter valiantly, and gloriouslie attaine the victorie.
               And holie Spirit, almightie God, comfort thou, and strengthen our minds against so diuers conflicts of



Satan, which besetteth vs by manie snares, and especiallie then most of al doth he seeke our destruction, when we seke deliuerance by other meanes than by thy word reuealed: grant therefore that, leauing thy worde deliuered vnto vs, we looke not after new reuelations, or violent rauishings, but may resist the Diuel by thy word, so wil he flie from vs,
               Amen.
            
            
               8. Euening praier, on VVensdaie.
               
               
                  O Lorde God, which art our life Deut. 30, verse. 20., and the length of our daies, our vpholder protecting vs from our youth: we thanke thee this euening, and with our lips wee extol thy woonderful goodnes, because thou hast defended vs this daie against al aduersities both of bodie and soule.
               O Lord, vnto thee doe we crie Psa. 141, 1., heare vs, harken vnto our voice



when we crie vnto thee. Let ourPsal. 141, 2. praiers be directed in thy sight as the incense, and let the lifting vp of our hands be an euening sacrifice.
               For thou delitest not in the offering of Buls and Rams, Psa. 50, 13. but the sacrifice of thankesgiuing shal honor14. thee.
               Who so keepeth the Law Sirac. 35, 1. bringeth offerings enough; he that holdeth fast the commandement offereth an offering of saluatiō. He that is thankful to them which haue wel2. deserued, offereth fine flower; and he that giueth almes, sacrificeth praise.
               Therefore in this euening-tide doe we offer vnto thee the continual sacrifice of thankesgiuing, praising thy goodnes for thy merciful protection and defence.
               We wil commend thee for thy truth, and sing of thee, O thou most Hie; Our lips shal sing of thee, and our soules which thou hast redeemed, yea and our tongues shal dailie speake of thy righteousnes, because they are confounded Psa 71, 13. and put to shame that sought after our soules.
               
                  We wil giue thankes vnto thee Psa. 138, 1., O Lorde, with our whole hart, because thou hast heard al the words of our mouthes. In the sight of the Gods we wil praise thee. We wil2. worship toward thine holy Temple, and celebrate thy Name, because of thy great mercie &amp; truth. For thou hast magnified thy Name, and thy word aboue al things. Whensoeuer3. we called vpon thee thou diddest heare vs, and enduedst our soules with much strength.
               And now we crie vnto thee, O Lorde, with our voice, Psa. 142, 1. yea in thy sight doe we poure out our praiers, and in our troble doe we vtter them2. before thee, that thou maiest pardon al our offences, and those especiallie which we haue committed this daie.
               Bring not into thy iudgement, O Lord, al our idle and vaine words Matth. 12, verse. 36., pardon our babling, &amp; vaine speech, and impute not our foolishnes vnto vs.
               Be merciful vnto vs, O Lord, for we are greatlie pensiue for our sins, our harts be trobled within vs, and the feare of death is fallen vpon vs.



Fearefulnes &amp; trembling are come vpon vs Psa. 55, 4. and an horrible dread hath ouerwhelmed vs.
               But, O Lord, absolue vs from al our sinnes through thy worde bringing vnto vs the ioieful tydings of gratious deliuerance.
               O comfort the harts of thy seruants Psal. 86, 4.: for vnto thee, Lord, haue we lifted vp our soules. For thou art5. milde, gentle, and of much mercie to as manie as cal vpon thee.
               Blessed be the Lorde which hath heard the voice of our humble petitions Psa. 28, 6. 7.. O God thou art our strength, and our shield, our harts trusted in thee and we are holpen, therefore our harts doe daunce for ioie, and in our songes we wil praise thee.
               We cried vnto thee, O Lord, and saide Ps. 142, 5., Thou art our hope, and our portion in the lande of the liuing. Consider our complaint, for we are6. brought verie lowe. O deliuer vs from our persecutors: for they are too strong for vs. Bring our soules7. out of prison, that we may giue thanks vnto thy Name.
               O holie Trinitie, and perpetual vnitie, protect vs this night, that the



Diuel haue no power ouer vs.
               O Father gouerne vs by thy power; O Sonne, reuiue vs with thy wisedome; and lighten vs, O holie Ghost, with thy virtue.
               O Creator be thou present with vs; O Redeemer, aide vs; O our Comforter abide with vs.
               The Lord blesse vs Num. 6, 24 and keepe vs. The Lorde make his face to shine25. vpon vs, and be merciful vnto vs; the Lorde lift vp his countenance26. vpon vs, and giue vs peace.
               This blessing of God be this night and euermore a safetie, &amp; protection against al enimies, both visible and inuisible, that they hurt vs not anie waie.
               Euen as the piller of cloude Exo. 14, 19 20. in the desert stood betweene the tents of the Egyptians, and the tents of the children of Israël, that none hurt might come to the people of Israël: so be thou, O Lord, the protector of our soules, and liues; be thou, we beseech thee, an iron piller vnto vs Iere. 1, 18. that such as are our enimies preuaile not against vs, and be thou a brazen wal Ier. 15, 20. betweene vs, and al our aduersaries, that they come not



nie vs to our hurt.
               Giue vs this night a good sleepe, that quietlie without cares and anguish of minde we may rest this night; let not troblesome dreames, and fantasies in which is vanitie disquiet vs. Let our sleepe be sweet, &amp; helthful to our bodies, that Sirach. 31, verse. 20. waking in the morning we may rise in good helth, and delight in thee our God.
               Grant also that both being in bed, a sleepe, and awake we may alwaies remember our death, which is a passage to an immortal life, and withal our ioieful resurrection to euerlasting glorie,
            
            Amen.
         
         
            
               
               1. Morning praier on Thursdaie.
               
               
                  O Christ which art the light and the daie dwelling 1. Tim. 6, 16 in the light that no man can attaine vnto, the brightnes and cleerenes of the eternal Father, the bright morning Star Reu. 22, 16 driuing away the darcknes of night, and bringing the light of the daie ouer the face of the earth:
               We wil blesse thee in our life time, and lift vp our hands in thy Name with thankesgiuing, because thou hast bin our defender Psa 63, 5..
               Thou hast beheld our miseries, and hast not put vs into the handes of our enimies which did whisper against vs Psal. 41, 7., &amp; imagine euil toward vs; they spake euil of vs, that when we slepe we might rise no more. But8. thou, O Lord, tookedst compassion vpon vs, and didst raise vs againe,9. thou didst aide vs with thine arme of strength, and defend vs against al our enimies, and their inuasions with thy mightie power. Vnder the



shadow of thy wings we rested quietlie, in thy lap we laie secure and safe. We slept and toke our rest, and yet rose againe. For the Lord defended vs, and was our aide.
               God is in the mids of vs, Psal. 46, 5. therefore we wil not be mooued, God wil helpe vs and that right earelie, that we may reioice in his saluatiō.
               O thou onelie begotten Sonne of God, which sittest at the right hand of God thine almightie Father, we most humblie beseech thee by thy glorious ascention into the heauens Actes. 1, 9. wherby thou didst pierce the thick cloudes, that thou mightest put away our iniquities like a cloude Esaie. 44, verse. 22. &amp; wype away our sinnes, wherby thou, which art the Sonne of righteousnes, art hidden, that neither our soules can behold thee, neither our praiers ascende vnto thee, like a myst:
               Let thy light shine ouer vs this daie (like the cleere daie star piercing the thick mystes) to the expelling of the darknes of our vnderstanding Esai. 59, 9..
               For thou art Iohn. 1, 9. the true light lightning euerie man that commeth into



this world.
               Clarifie our harts, and driue away the darknes of error and ignorance, that, as at the breaking of the daie darkenes doth vanish: so al the darknes of our mindes may be remoued, that we continue not in the dongeon and shadow of death, but may approch to thy word 2. Peter. 1, verse. 19. as to a candle shining in a darke place, vntil the daie dawne, and thou the day star arise in our harts.
               Let thy worke appere to thy seruants Psa. 90, 16. and thy magnificence towards the sonnes of men. The glorious17. maiestie of the Lorde be vponDeut. 28, 12. vs, and prosper the workes of our hands vpon vs; O prosper the works of our hands.
               Let vs not, forgetting thy commandements, Deut. 28, verse. 14. Iosua. 1, 7. 8. decline from them either to the right hand or to the left, but make vs to meditate vpon them rising out of our beds, &amp; bind them for a signe vpon our hands Deut. 6, 7. Prou. 7, 3., and tie them to our fingers, &amp; write them on the table of our harts, that the memorie of them at no time depart out of our minds.
               O Lorde, we haue called vpon



thee daie by daie Psa. 88, 9., we haue stretched out our hands vnto thee.
               In our troble doe we lift vp our hands vnto thee, O Lorde, beseeching thee most humbly to kepe vs this daie, and al our life time from the place of hel Psa. 49, 15., and to deliuer vs from the clawes of the vngodlie.
               O Lord, be merciful vnto vs, we haue longed for thee, be thou our helpe and shield Ps. 33, 20., &amp; our saluation in the time of troble. Send downe thine hand from aboue Psa. 144, 7. and deliuer vs. Stretch forth thine arme with power, strengthen thine hand, &amp; lift vp thy right hand to saue vs.
               Arise now, O Lorde, Psalm. 10, vers. 13, &amp;c. put forth thine hand, &amp; forget not the poore. Breake thou the power of the vngodlie and malitious, that we without feare of danger may confesse and praise thee.
               Though we walke in the middes of troble Psa. 138, 7., yet wilt thou refresh vs; &amp; against the furiousnes of our enimies wilt thou stretch forth thine hand, and thy right hand shal saue vs, that al may knowe and vnderstand that this is thine hand, and that thou hast saued vs.
               
                  Therefore we wil praise the Lord which stood at the right hand of the poore Psal. 109. verse. 31. to saue his soule from the persecutors.
               O most mightie protector, keepe vs likewise from al bodilie harme.
               Deliuer vs from the myre Psa. 69, 2. that we perish not, deliuer vs from such as hate vs, and from the deepe waters, that the fluds ouerwhelme vs not, neither the deepe swalow vs vp; protect vs with thine hand that we perish not by thy firie darts.
               Thou God rulest the virtues of the elements, which thou hast created, and guidest the raging of the sea Psal. 89, 9..
               For thou art the God Amo. 4, 13 which framest the mountaines, &amp; makest the winds, and declarest vnto man what his thought is, thou makest the morning and darknes, and walkest vpon the hie places of the earth, the Lord God of Hostes is thy Name worlds without ende,
               Amen.
            
            
               
               2. A thankesgiuing vnto God for our foode.
               
               
                  WE thanke thee, King of glorie, Lord of heauen &amp; earth, because thou hast from our youth to this present houre maruelouslie nourished vs, giuing vs meat, drinke, and clothing with al other thinges pertaining to the sustentation of this our life.
               Naked and bare came we out of our mothers wombes Iob. 1, 21. Eccle. 5, 14., we brought nothing into the world 1. Tim. 6, 7, but whatsoeuer we haue thou gauest the same; yea, it was afore we were borne; and in our mothers wombe didst thou ordaine things necessarie for this life, and sufferest vs to enioie al things abundantlie.
               Alwaie thou hast a care of vs, as a father hath of his children; neither art thou ignorant that we stand in neede continuallie of thy blessings, and dailie are destitute of new reliefe: al which thou giuest after thy wonted, and vnspeakable goodnes.
               We acknowledge that whatsoeuer



we haue, or possesse, it is thy gift; &amp; confesse thee to be the fountaine of al good things Iam. 1, 17., and perceiue thy Fatherlie goodnes to be spread not onelie ouer al mankind, but also ouer the brute creatures. Thou giuest meat to al flesh; thou giuest fodder to the Cattel; and feedest the yong rauens that cal vpvpon thee Ps. 147, 9..
               For corporal goodes are not distributed among men by chance, or without thy prouidence; neither be they attained by the onelie industrie and power of man.
               Thou giuest Ps. 104, 28. and we gather; thou openest thine hande, and al liuing creatures are filled with thy blessing. For without thee al our endeuors be in vaine, and if thou blesse not our labors, we do but beate the winde and receiue no profite.
               Great is thy mercie, O Lorde, which disdainest not to prouide for sinful flesh.
               O Lord our God, great are thy wonderous works Psa. 40, 6. which thou hast done for vs, the which we can not so much as in thought comprehend, much lesse in words expresse. When



we would report and vtter them, we founde them moe than we coulde recite.
               But notwithstanding thine infinite benefits cannot be comprehended of man: yet wil we not surcesse to set forth thy praise, nor hide thy goodnes from the sonnes of men, but wil declare it and speake of thy truth from one generation to another.
               Blessed art thou, O our God, for euer and euer 1. Chr. 29, verse. 10. 11. 12., al that is either aboue in the heauens, or in earth beneath, is thine. Al things come from thee, and from thine hands we receiue whatsoeuer we possesse. And al those things of thy meere mercie without our merits or worthines.
               Therefore we wil magnifie the Lord, which doth mightie things in al the corners of the earth, which doth nourish vs from our mothers wombes Psa. 71, 6., and giueth vs al good things.
               Grant vs likewise quietnes of minde, and peace in our time, that thy grace may abound towarde vs, continue, and defende vs while we



liue.
               O Almightie and merciful Father, by thy breath we toke life Acts. 17, 25 the which through thy blessing doth abide in vs. In thee we liue Act. 17, 28., moue, and haue our being.
               For man liueth not by bread onelie Deut. 8, 3. Matth. 4, 4. Luke. 4, 4., or by his owne wisedome and forecast, neither art thou bounde with a fatal chaine of second causes, but by thy decree and wil we enioie life, &amp; al things created at thy beck doe continue while thou thinkest good.
               Giue vs not onelie store of al things to the necessitie of our life: but grant also to our meate &amp; drink virtue and power to relieue and strengthen our bodies. For thou alone vpholdest al thinges by thy worde of power Heb. 1, 3..
               Vnles thou dailie didst feede vs with thy hidden grace, which thou dost enspire into the bread to feede vs, al the heapes of our yeerelie encrese were to smal purpose. For be it, that there be abundance of wheat, wine, and of al other things: yet vnles they be watred by thy blessing quicklie would al come to naught,



and we shoulde perish for lacke of foode in al that abundance. For al the substance which we possesse, what is it without thou prosper and fructifie the same with thy blessing.
               And albeit we feede on bread Matt. 4, 4. Deutr. 8, 3.: yet we ascribe not our life to the virtue of the bread; neither is thy power tied to the bread; nor mans life included within the same, but altogether it dependeth vpon thy wil and good pleasure.
               We besech thee for thy most large and bountiful liberalitie, cast vs not of Psal. 71, 9. in the time of our old age; and when our strength faileth vs, forsake vs not.
               Likewise confirme our faith that we distrust not thy promises; neither be we driuen from thee by any meanes, seeme they neuer so contrarie to natural causes: but giue grace that we may withdrawe our eies from al wordlie consultations, and, as touching our foode, and other necessaries for this life, may wholie depend vpon thee, and at no time go beyond the limits which thou hast prescribed, through our Lord Iesu Christ, which liueth and



raigneth with thee for euermore,
               Amen.
            
            
               3. A praier for vni tie in Religion.
               
               
                  O Eternal God, which hast called vs to the vnitie of the true catholike faith, and gathered vs by thy word into the lap of the Christian congregation, that we may be al of vs one bodie, Ephes 4, 4. 5. 6. and one spirit, euen as we are called in one hope of our calling. One Lord, one faith, one baptisme, one God, and Father of al, which is aboue al, and through al, and in vs al. For euen as thou Father art in thy Sonne, and he in thee Ioh▪ 17, 21.: so should we also be one in thee our God.
               And therefore we crie vnto thee, O almightie Father, and eternal God, teach vs thy waies Psa. 86, 11. that we may walke in thy truth; O knit our harts vnto thee that we may feare thy Name.
               Grant that al thy faithful may be like affected Philip. 2, 2. Rom. 12, 16., and of one minde,



as thou art, thinking the same thing after the ensample of Christ our Sauior, and that as wel in minds Rom. 15, 6. as with mouth we may agree among our selues, both in true doctrine, and in outwarde behauior of conuersation. For the scope of the Churches felicitie consisteth in the vnitie of true faith and religion.
               Keepe vs in the true vnderstanding, and right knowledge of thy sacred scriptures, that without strife and contention, we may speake one thing 1. Cor. 1, 10. Philip. 3, 16. Let there be no dissentions nor schismes among vs; let nothing be done through contention, or of vaine glorie, but let vs be one bodie, endued with one minde, and iudgement, according to thy worde reuealed, vntil we attaine Ephe. 4, 12▪
                   to the vnitie of faith and knowledge of thy13. Sonne into a perfect man, according to the measure of the age of15. the fulnes of Christ, which is the head, by whom the whole bodie being copled and knit together by euerie ioint for the furniture therof,16. (according to the effectual power, which is in the measure of euerie part) receiueth encrease of the bodie,



vnto the edifieng of it selfe in loue.
               O most holie Father, keepe vs by thy Name, that we may be one in thee Ioh. 17, 21., and that among vs which are beleeuers, there may be one hart and one minde.
               O Christ our onelie Sauior and Mediator, which before thy passion didst praie that we might be one in thee Ioh. 17, 21. euen as thou art in thy Father: grant that thy Church may be at concorde, and agree in one true faith and confession.
               Let there continue among vs a godlie consent; let there be one agreement in faith, one mind in praier, that we may grow vp in thee, and that al our harts may be copled together by the bond of the Spirit, vsing thy gifts, as they should be, to the aduancement of thy glorie, and to the common profit both of thy Church and Common-weale; and walking worthie our calling Ephes. 4, 1. whervnto we are called, with al humilitie &amp; gentlenes, with al lenitie forbearing2. one another through charitie, being careful to keepe the vnitie3. of the Spirit in the bonde of



peace.
               Represse the furiousnes of Satan which soweth discention among thy flock to weaken our faith, and to hinder our praiers, whereby thy glorie is defaced.
               Grant therefore that we proue not desirous of vaine glorie Gal. 5, 26. prouoking one another, and enuieng one another, that we bite not one another to our destruction Gal. 5, 15.. For of emulation spring contentions which being once enflamed, boile out into mortal diuisions. And as many as maintaine emulations, contentions, and factions, are carnal 1. Cor. 3, 3. and walke as men.
               Wherefore take from vs the zeale of the flesh, which is foolish. And let al enuie Ephe. 4, 31 wrath, pride, and arrogancie be far from vs.
               Likewise let vs auoide 1. Tim. 1, 4. 1. Tim. 6, 4. foolish and vnlearned questions, knowing that they engender strife and contention,20. and serue for nothing but to the subuerting of the hearers, and engrafting of errors.
               Where a desire of strife is, there certainlie God dwelleth not 1. Iohn. 4, verse. 16.: and they which raise tumults of nothing,



and disquiet thy flock, those wilt thou, O Sonne of God, destroie.
               Come holie Spirit, replenish the harts of the faithful, and inflame in them the fire of thy loue, which once didst gather the nations into the vnitie of the faith through the diuersitie of tongues Actes. 2, 4.:
               Ioine our harts together, that we may nourish christian concorde among vs, and that we al glued, as it were together in louing harts, may be of one minde in thee; so shal thy pure doctrine zelouslie be maintained, and no false interpretation of the Scripture obstinatelie be defended.
               Bring home to thy fold al such as are turned from the vnitie of true religion, that there may be one pastor and one folde Ioh. 10, 16. Ezec. 37, 22.
               To such as are gone out from vs, grant constancie that they may continue with vs teaching the Gospel to the saluation of the hearers.
               And if it fortune that any, contrarie to the doctrine which we haue learned, raise dissention and offences, grant that we may auoide them Rom. 16, verse. 17. 2. Iohn. 10., least the harts of the simple,



through their sweete perswasions, and flatterie, be deceaued.
               O God, autor of peace 1. Cor. 14, verse. 33. 2. Thes. 3, 16, and concorde, giue grace that euerie of vs may thinke the same thing according to our Sauiour Christ,
               Amen.
            
            
               4. A praier for peace.
               
                  O Most Hie God, and holie Father which art not the Autor of dissention but of peace 1. Cor. 14, verse. 33. 2. Cor. 13, 11, not of confusion, nor of inordinate life, but the keeper of discipline and quietnes, from thee come holie cogitations, and good counsailes, and righteous deedes:
               Giue vnto vs thy seruants that peace which the world cannot giue, that both our harts and works may be applied to thy commandements, and that our daies, through thy protection, be alwaies quiet from troble.
               Gouerne thou the whole state both of the Chuch and Common weale, and rule our life, that in our daies iustice may take place Psal. 72, 7., and



peace continue as long as the moone shal haue hir course.
               Speake thou peace vnto the common people, and ouer thy Saints, and likewise to them which are conuerted, and turned to a better minde.
               Let thy saluation be nigh them that feare thee Psal. 85, 9., that glorie may dwel within our lande. Let mercie and truth meete together, yea, let10. iustice and peace embrace ech other. Let truth arise out of the11. earth, &amp; righteousnes looke downe from heauen. Let the mountaines Psa. 72, 3. and the hils bring peace to thy people by iustice.
               Blesse Lord al Countries, Cities, Townes, and places where thy word doth abide and is purelie preached.
               Let them haue much peace that loue thy Lawe and doctrine, and let them be without stones to stumble at, and offences; let there be peace within their wals Psa. 122, 7., and prosperitie within their palaces.
               O Lord, strengthen the locks of our ports, and blesse thy children within them, put peace for our endes, and bounds; and fil vs with



the fat of the corne, that thou King of glorie, and Lord of hostes maist enter by our gates Psal. 24, 7., and the pure worde may abide not onelie in our wals, but also in our wils, to the glorie of thy Name, and comfort of our soules; and that honest discipline together with integritie of virtue, maners, and humane literature may be maintained.
               O eternal God, which hast called vs in peace 1. Cor. 7, 15, grant that with al men, as much as in vs lies Rom. 12, verse. 18. we may haue peace; and let vs account of holines Heb. 12, 14 without which none shal see the Lord.
               Asswage our harts, that we may cleane forget al iniuries, and forgiue ech other in many things, least by reuenging our selues we take awaie the publike tranquilitie.
               Represse the Diuel, the breaker of godlie concord and christian peace, which ranging throughout al regions soweth euerie where the seede of strife and debate.
               O God of peace which makest an ende of war Psal. 46, 9. in al the worlde, and breakest the bowe, and knappest the speares asunder, and burnest



the chariots with fire; protect vs from war and slaughter; scatter the nations Psal. 68, 1. that wish for war.
               Breake thou and hinder al euil counsailes, and the purpose of such as mind and thirst after nothing els but the shedding of innocent blood.
               Confound them in their imaginations Psal. 6, 10. that they take none effect, let them be turned back and put to shame. Let them come to shame, and perish through their owne imaginations Psal. 5, 10., that Churches and schooles wel ordained be not ouerthrowne, nor Idolatrie get the dominion ouer vs.
               Ingraffe therefore into al men of what calling soeuer, a desire of peace; contented minds in their vocations, and a carefulnes to aduance the welfare of that place where they doe abide: so shal they, neither through a desire of others wealth, nor by ambition or vaine glorie raise any tumults to our disquietnes.
               And where strife, contention, &amp; discord is among men, there doe thou, O most mightie God, reconcile their harts and minds that those



flames, and fires may speedilie be put out. For thou canst conclude a truce for vs Iob. 5, 23. with the stones of the grounde; and compel the beasts of the fielde to seeke those things as belong to our peace, and the wolfe to dwel with the Lambe Esai. 11, 6., and the Leopard to lie downe with the Kid.
               Therefore make our tabernacles safe &amp; quiet, that about them there may be a rich tranquilitie, which may abound like the streame running ouer his bank Esai. 48, 18, and our righteousnes as the waues of the sea, which is neuer without water.
               In the Lorde shal we haue our wished peace, and the worke of righteousnes shal be peace Esai 32, 17, &amp; hir frute rest and quietnes for euer. And thy people shal dwel in the Innes of18. peace, and in sure dwellings, in safe places of comfort.
               In ioie shal we go forth Esai. 55, 12 and returne in peace, the mountaines and hils shal sing with vs for ioie, and al the trees of the field shal clap their hands.

Cor. 12, verse. 2., and fained Gods, euen as they are led, and runne to worship that which is no God.
               Giue grace, that thy word may be knowen among them Esai. 19, 21., and preached in euerie land, and the sound thereof go out into the endes of the worlde Psal. 19, 4.

of their fathers Mat. 15, 2. 9.; or trusting to their owne righteousnes, or rather to the workes and deedes of the flesh, refuse and make little account of thy righteousnes Rom. 10, 3 which is the true iustification, and go about to establish their owne righteousnes.4. But Christ is the ende of the Lawe for righteousnes to as manie as beleeue. And, 1. Cor. 3, 11 an other foundation can no man laie, than that is laide in thy Sonne the Messias, which is the waie, Iohn. 14, 6. the truth, the life, and the ende of the Lawe.
               For by his perfect obedience and fulfilling of the Lawe, by his innocent and bitter death, he hath restored vnto vs true saluation, and perfect righteousnes, that euerie one Iohn. 3, 15. which beleeueth on him might not perish, but haue euerlasting life.
               O God, the sight of the blind, bring them home againe, which through ignorance either are entangled in doubtful labyrinthes, and grosse errors, or countenance polluted religion, that lightened by thy spirit, they may returne into the right waie.
               
                  And such as with impudent faces, and stiffe necks, do obstinatlie, with an affected ignorance withstande thine holie Spirit whose senses the God of this worlde hath blinded 2. Cor. 4, 4 that the light of thy glorious Gospel shine not ouer them, represse, &amp; bridle their malice, that by slaughters &amp; persecutions they nether troble nor destroy thy Church,

               6. A praier for our benefactors.
               
               
                  O Merciful, faithful, and louing God, rewarder of al good workes.
               Forasmuch as ingratitude is the most odious &amp; detestable vice of al, the which both thou doest abhor, &amp; no wise man can abide, as a thing deseruing infinit paines and rigorous punishment. For he which rendreth euil for good Pro. 17, 13., euil shal not depart from his house. And Wis. 16, 29 the hope of the vnthankful shal melt away like the winter ice, and flow away as vnprofitable water.
               We beseech thee giue vs grateful



mindes alwaies remembring benefits receiued, least forgetting the merits exhibited vpon vs, we fal into the filthie and abhominable fault of ingratitude.
               But gouerne vs with thine holie Spirit, that we may alwaies giue thanks vnto thee, a most bountiful God, for such benefits as thou hast bestowed, not vpon vs onelie, but vpon al mankind:
               For creating vs after thine owne image Gen. 1, 26. Colos. 3, 10.; for redeeming vs being sinners forlorne, and condemned; for deliuering vs from sinne, death, and hel by the most holie and pretious blood of thy deere Sonne 1. Pet. 1, 19 Hebr. 9, 14.; for bestowing thy righteousnes, thine holie Spirit, and euerlasting life vpon vs; for conseruing our soules, and bodies safe and sounde; finallie for giuing, and that abundantlie al such things as are necessarie for the sustentation of this life; and besides, for thy merciful protection against al dangers; al which thou doest of thy meere mercie and Fatherlie goodnes without any merits or worthines of ours.
               And therefore we wil extol thee,



O God of our life, and yeeld thanks to thy Name, O most hie. For thou art gratious Psa. 136, 1. and thy mercie endureth for euer.
               We wil giue thee thanks, O Lord, among the people; we wil sing to thee among the nations. For the greatnes Psa. 57, 10. of thy mercie reacheth vnto the heauens.
               So infinite and great are thy benefits conferred vpon vs, O Lord, that we are vnable to conceiue them in our minds.
               Notwithstanding our mouthes shal speake of thy righteousnes and saluation Psa. 71, 15. for we know none end thereof.
               What recompence shal we make to the Lord for al the benefits that he hath done vnto vs Ps. 116, 12. 13.? We wil take vp the cup of saluation, and cal vpon the Name of the Lord. We wil14. 18. pay our vowes vnto the Lord in the presence of his people.
               We wil neuer forget thy benefits and woonderous works which thou hast done for vs. To thee, O God the Father, be thanks for al things Eph. 5, 20. in the name of our Lorde Iesus Christ.
               
                  Secondlie, we thinke it our bounden dutie to praie for our benefactors that haue begot, brought vp, taught, and promoted vs, that it woulde please thee to repaie them, and al other for whom I am bounde to praie, whose necessities are knowen to thee.
               These I commende to thy mercie in our praiers, that thou maist blesse them both with temporal and euerlasting rewards.
               O celestial God, and most excellent recompencer thou hast power and mercie Psa. 62, 12. Matt. 16, 27. Rom. 2, 6. to render to euerie one according to their workes. Do wel, O Lorde, Psa. 125, 4. vnto those that be good and true of hart.
               Vouchsafe to reward al our benefactors; let them receiue most plentiful benefits according to the multitude of thy mercies.
               Shewe mercie vnto them, O Lord, that haue comforted vs; and so blesse their families, that they may finde mercie with thy Sonne our Lord and Sauior Christ at that daie 2. Tim. 1, verse. 18. when we shal al appeere before his tribunal seate Rom. 14, verse. 10. 2. Cor. 5, 10. to giue an accompt of our works.
               
                  O Sonne of the liuing God, which dost ascribe and impute the same to be done vnto thee Mat. 25, 40 which is extended vnto any of thy seruants; and dost promise a most liberal reward euen for a cup of cold water Mat. 10, 42 Mark. 9, 41., requite according to thy woonted goodnes, euerie one which haue extended the works of mercie, and the duties of humanitie vpon vs, that they may be blessed, and enriched mightilie 2. Cor. 9, 6 with the encrease of good things.
               He which hath consideration of the poore and needie Psal. 41, 1▪
                  , let him be deliuered, O Lord, in the euil daie; Keepe him, giue him life, make him2. blessed in the land, and giue him not vp to the wil of his enimies; but comfort him when he lieth sick3. in his bed, and in the daie of troble heare his praiers. Let his almes be alwaie in thy sight Sirac. 3, 15. 16., and be mindful of him for euer, that when he falleth he may be vpholden.
               Grant, Lord, that according to our habilities we may recompence benefits receiued; and shewe our selues grateful in deede, that our leaues wither not, neither that we

                  So that al things, as it were, ouerburdened and wearied, doe grone, and trauel in paine together with thine elect, and desire a deliuerance Rom. 8, 19. from such and so great euils, whervnto they are subiect, and made to serue to vanitie at the lust of the wicked.
               Vnto thee doe we crie from the bottome of our harts, Segregate vs, O Lord, from the darknes, decept, and filthines of this world, and withdrawe vs from the desire of earthlie things, that being incorporated into thy congregation, where thy Diuinitie doth abide, we may seeke after heauenlie things, and forsake earthlie, which are fraile and transitorie.
               O righteous Father, the worlde doth not knowe thee Ioh. 7, 28., but thy Sonne doth know thee, and they to29. whom thy Sonne doth reueale thee by thine holie Spirit.
               Giue vs the same thy Spirit, that we may know what riches we haue receiued by Christ, and speake not the things which mans wisedome doth teach 1. Cor. 2, verse. 13., but which thy Spirit shal teach comparing spiritual



things with spiritual.
               Keepe vs in the confession of thy Name, that thou in vs maist be glorified, and that we fauor not of terrene and wordlie things but dwelling in minde in heauen, may seeke those things that are aboue Colos. 3, 2. and be made partakers of the diuine nature, and flie from the corruption, which is in the world: least in this miserable and dronken state therof, we enwrap our selues in worldlie cares, which withdraw our minds from the exercise of godlines, and choake the good motions of the holie Spirit.
               Grant therefore that we loue neither the world 1. Ioh. 2, 15, nor the things in the world: but vsing this world, we may be as those which vse it not 1. Ioh. 2, 17. For the forme of this world doth passe awaie.
               Rule thou our harts that we giue not our selues to the pleasures of this world; neither enter into the broade waie, and wide gate Mat. 7, 13. which bringeth to eternal destruction: but shunning al the enticements of this world may go in at the narrow gate14. to the kingdome of heauen.
               
                  O Christ our Redeemer, which hast chosen and seuered vs from this world, that, not imitating the same, we might be saued: giue grace that al which haue promised wholie to serue thee, which dost ouerthrow the prince of this world Ephe. 2, 2. Iohn. 12, 31., may be safe from al the assaults of the subtile spirit.
               For it were a shameful and traitorous deed to promise wholie to be thy seruants, and yet to fauor thy mortal enimie, and to followe his workes. But he that warreth 2. Tim. 2,

               Guide vs that we follow not the vading glorie of this world, neither delite therein. For he which wil fauor the world is an enimie to God. But let the world be crucified to vs Gala. 2, 19. and we to the world, through the denial of our selues, and renouncing al the enticements of the same.
               Grant vs grace, that we may walke wiselie Eph. 5, 15. Coloss. 4, 5. 1. Peter. 4, 2. and circumspectlie in this present world, not as fooles and vnwise, but as wise: and shun al occasions of falling, and redeeme the time Eph. 5, 16. because the daies are euil.
               
                  O God the holie Ghost, poure into vs thine heauenlie wisdom, which is from aboue Sirach. 1, 1. Iames. 1, 5. Prou. 2, 6., that in spiritual matters we may cast off altogether the wisdome of the world, which is foolishnes with God 1. Cor. 3, 19, &amp; in the simplicitie of mind cleaue vnto thy word.
               Instruct vs, that hauing renounced vngodlines Titu. 2, 12., we may walke vprightlie and godlie in this worlde; looking for that blessed hope, and13. appearing of the glorie of the great God, and of our Sauior Iesus Christ, which gaue himselfe for vs to redeeme14. vs from al iniquitie, and to make vs a pure peculiar people vnto himselfe, zelous of good works Phili. 2, 16 Ephes. 2, 10. 1.

               Comfort our minds, that our harts be not trobled Iohn. 14, 1. 27. when the worlde doth persecute vs. For we are counted no better than the verie excrements, and of

               Vphold vs in the mids of our afflictions, that both the world and



the prince thereof may wel knowe, that thou hast a tender care Iohn. 3, 15. 16. ouer thy poore flock, &amp; wilt protect, and saue the same euerlastinglie,

                  WE thanke thee, Psa. 136, 2. 3. 26. King of heauen &amp; earth, for protecting vs this daie by thy strong hand, &amp; stretched out arme from al perils.
               The right hande of the Lorde Ps. 118, 15. bringeth mightie things to passe; the right hand of the Lord hath exalted16. vs; the right hand of the Lord doth great things, it hath kept vs from al euil; the Lord hath saued our soules.
               Therefore we wil be mindful of thee, O Lord, vpon our beds, and waking wil we meditate of thy goodnes, because thou hast bin our helper Psal. 63, 7. 8.; vnder the shadow of thy wings wil we reioice. Our soules



cleaue vnto thee, because thy right hand hath vpholden vs, and saued vs in our extremities.
               We wil be mindful of the time past wherein thou maruelouslie didst assist vs, and meditate of al thy deedes Psa. 143, 5.. We wil discourse of the workes of thine hands, and wil neuer forget thy mightines.
               For thy mercie endureth for euer 1. Ezra. 3, verse. 11., &amp; thou wilt not despise the workmanship of thine owne hands.
               Now blesse the Lord al his seruants Psa. 134, 1. which stand in the house of the Lord in the courts of the house of our GOD; in the night lift vp2. your hands to his sanctuarie, and blesse the Lord. The Lorde which3. made both heauen and earth, blesse vs from aboue.
               Vnto thee, O Lorde, doe we lift vp our hands, and beseech thee with al humblenes of minde, pardon al our sinnes, which this daie we haue committed either against thee, or our neighbors.
               Our handes are defiled with blood Esai. 59, 3., and our fingers with much iniquitie. Our transgressions are afore thee, and make answere against



vs.
               But doe not thou, Lorde, beholde the wickednes of thy people 2. Esdr. 8, verse. 26.: but remember thy couenant which thou hast made with vs in the blood of thy Sonne; neither consider thou27. our wicked enterprises, but haue in mind that thy testimonies are pure among vs, and thy worde vndefiled. Thinke not vpon those that haue28. walked fainedlie before thee: but remember them which according to thy wil doe feare thee. Neither29. doe thou destroie them which haue liued beastly: looke vpon them that not onelie teach, but obserue thy commandements. Take thou none30. indignatiō at them which are worse than beasts: but loue them alwaies that put their trust in thy righteousnes and glorie. For we and our31. Fathers haue al the same sicknes: but because of vs sinners thou shalt be called merciful. For if thou hast32. mercie on vs, thou shalt be called merciful to vs that haue no works of righteousnes.
               And therefore be thou merciful vnto vs, O Lord, for thy Name sake, and pardon al our transgressions,



whereby most infinitelie we haue deserued thine euerlasting displeasure. Let thine hand be readie to saue vs, that we may prefer thy commandements aboue al things, and fulfil them with our fingers.
               O Lord, Psal. 77, 2. in our troble doe we seeke thee; our hands in this night season are lifted vp to thee, Neither shal anie thing be in cause, but that in this darke and dreadful night, thou shalt lighten and illustrate euerie darke corner of our habitation, that our candels go not out by night.
               When we sit in darknes Mica. 7, 8. bring vs into the light, saue vs from vtter darknes Mat. 22, 13 where is weeping and gnashing of teeth. Thou art the God which giuest light to our candle, lighten therefore our darknes, O our God, Psal. 13, 3. that we sleepe not in death. And protect vs by the shadow of thine hand Esai. 51, 16. that none euil stick to vs this night.
               Deliuer vs from the snare of the hunter Psal. 91, 3. 4., and from the noisome pestilence. Defende vs vnder thy wings, and vnder thy feathers we shal be safe. Let thy truth compasse5.


                  
vs like a shield, that we be not afraidPsal. 91, 6. for any terror by night, nor yet either for the pestilence that walketh in darknes, or for the sicknes that destroieth at noone daie. A thousande shal fal beside vs, and7. ten thousand on our right hand, but it shal not come nigh vs.
               O Lorde, deliuer vs out of the hands of our enimies Psal. 21, 8. Psal. 36, 11., and saue vs from such as persecute our soules: they imagine wickednes in their chambers, they sleepe not Pro. 4, 16. except they haue done mischiefe, and sleepe is taken from them vntil they haue done harme.
               O Lord, keepe vs, O Lord, be thou our defence ouer our right hande, that the sun parch vs not by day Psal. 121, 6., nor the moone by night.
               The Lord is our light Psal. 27, 1., and our saluation, whom then should wee feare? The Lord is the strength of our life, of whom then should we be afraide? Though an host of men3. were laide against vs; yet shal not our harts be afraid: and though the wicked should rise vp against vs to deuour our flesh; yet it shal be our5. comfort alwaie, that thou wilt hide



vs in thy tabernacle in the euil day, and defende vs in the secret place of thy dwelling through Christ our Lord,
            
            Amen.

                  BLessed is the Lord God of Sabbaoth which by his commandement created the morning, and assigned Iob. 38, 12. 13. to the daie spring his place, where arising euery daie it apprehendeth the wings of the earth, and speedilie runneth to the vttermost parts of the world.
               Who is like our God Psa. 77, 13 14., which doth woonderous things both in heauen and earth?
               O Lord, Esai. 66, 1. Actes. 7, 48. 49. heauen is thy seat, and



the earth is thy footestoole.
               Vnto thee doe we bend our selues, yeelding most humble thankes for that it hath pleased thee of thy wonted goodnes to preserue vs this night vnder thy merciful protectiō.
               Of thy clemencie hast thou deliuered our soules from the mids of Lions among whom we laie; with thy shielde of saluation hast thou compassed vs about, like as a shepherd Esai. 40, 11 Iere. 31, 10. watcheth, and looketh to his flock.
               Wherefore we wil sing of thy power Psa. 59, 16., and praise thy mercie betimes in the morning. For thou hast bin our defence and refuge in the daie of our troble.
               We beseech thee euen for the bloodie sweate of thy Sonne our Lord and Sauior Christ, that thou wouldest vouchsafe this morning to moisten and mollifie our harts, through the grace of thine holie Spirit.
               As the morning dew Wis. 11, 19. spreading it selfe earelie before daie doth wet, and fil the earth; and as the morning raine 2. Sam. 23, verse. 4. by drops doth water drie places, wherby they do fructifie



and bring forth herbes and grasse: so extende thy grace toward vs Psal. 72, 6. Micah. 5, 7., and by thine heauenlie dewe besprinkle our hard and drie harts, that we may wholie delight Ps. 119, 14. in the waies of thy righteousnes, &amp; walke in the pathes of thy commandements.1.
               
               Let thy liuing Spirit Ps. 143, 10 guide vs forth into the land of righteousnes. O Lorde, for thy Name sake quicken11. vs in thy righteousnes, that thy word may be Psal. 119, verse. 105. a lanterne vnto our feete, and a light vnto our steps.
               Shew vs thy waies Psal. 25, 4., O Lord, and teach vs thy pathes.
               Order our steps according to thy word, so shal no wickednes Psal. 119, verse. 133. haue dominion ouer vs, neither shal we wander from the right waie.
               Take from vs the waie of lieng Ps. 119, 29., and grant vs graciouslie thy lawe.
               O would to God our waies were directed to the keeping of thy statutes, that we might not walke Psalm. 1, 1. in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the waie of sinners, nor sit in the seate of the scorneful, but delight in2. the lawe of the Lorde, and exercise



our selues therein daie and night; then should we be as a tree Psal. 1, 3. Ierem. 17, 8. planted by the riuers of waters, that bringeth forth hir frute in due season.
               O Lorde, in our trobles we wil seeke thee earelie in the morning, and returne vnto thee our GOD, which art readie as the spring of the daie, and wilt come vnto vs as the fructifieng raine Hose. 6, 3., and as the timelie and latter shoure which doth good to the earth: be thou in like maner a refuge vnto the poore, and a timelie helper in our troble.
               We wil loue thee deerelie Psal. 18, 1., O Lorde our strength: thou art our rock and our defence, our Sauior,2. our God, and our might in whom we wil trust, our buckler, the horne of our saluation and our refuge.
               Keepe vs, Lord, from the hands of the vngodlie Psa. 140, 4.; preserue vs from wicked men, which are purposed to ouerthrow our goings. The proude5. haue laide a snare for vs, and spred a net abroad with cordes, yea, and set traps in our waie. But deliuer thou our soules from death Psa. 56, 13. Psal. 103, 4., and



our feete from falling.
               For thou art righteous, O Lorde, and dwellest in the middes of vs Soph. 3, 5. doing none iniquitie: but earelie, earelie euerie morning bringest thou forth thy iudgement into light, and wilt not be drawen awaie from sauing vs, that we be not hurt of bloodie felowes, of theeues &amp; murtherers, whose feete are swift Pro. 6, 18. Prou. 1, 16. 11. to shed blood.

               And therefore, thy Disciples being



fled Matth. 26, verse. 56., thou didst voluntarilie commit thy selfe Matth. 26, vers. 53, &amp;c. into the handes of the cruel Iewes, which brought thee most rigorouslie bounde without compassion from the presence of one corrupt Iustice vnto another more cruel: where thou being falselie accused, was vniustlie condemned, contemptuouslie spit vpon, opprobriouslie obraided, and buffeted most iniuriouslie. For our offences thou wast wounded Esai. 53, 5., and for our wickednes broozed, for the offences of thy people thou wast beaten, killed, and with sharpe thornes crowned, and contumeliouslie dealt withal.
               For our sinnes thou wast cruellie handled, a worme Psal. 22, 6., not a man: a verie scorne of men, and the outcast of the people.
               Thy looke was odious, and il fauoured, a man thou wast ful of sorrowes Esai. 53, 3. 2., without forme or beautie, so that they had no lust vnto thee.
               Besides some couered thine eies Mark. 14, verse. 65. Matth. 27, vers. 30, &amp;c. Iohn. 19, verse. 3, &amp;c., and laide vpon thy face with their fists, exasperating thy torments with manie scoffes, and mockes.
               Thy blessed bodie was so mangled,



and cut with stripes, that euen an Ethnike pittieng the same, vttered these words, Iohn. 19, 5. Behold the man.
               Finallie, for our enormous offences, thou wast hanged, like an accursed wretch Matth. 27, verse. 38. Mark. 15, 27 28. betweene two theeues; afflicted with a most odious kind of death Deu. 21, 23 Galat. 3, 13.; pierced through the hands and the feete, whereby thou didst encounter with most extreeme torments; which were so great, that for a space, thou wast after a sort without al maner comfort Mar. 15, 34, and so constrained through thy great sorowe and greeuousnes of paine to drinke vineger Matth. 27, verse. 48. Mark. 15, 36 Iohn 19, 30.; &amp; so in the extremitie of paine thou didst giue vp thy Ghost, cōmending the same vnto thy deere Father Luke. 23, verse. 46., in wonderful patience, like a sheepe lead to the slaughter Esai. 53, 7. and as a lambe quiet before the shearer: thou didst not open thy mouth to raile Acts. 8, 32. 1. Pet. 2, 23., yea, that was so far from thee that thou praiedst for thine enimies Luke. 23, verse. 34.: that so by thy torments, hauing quited vs from al guilt aswel of fault as of punishment, we might be healed.
               For to this ende didst thou be are the burden of our sinnes vpon the



woode of the crosse 1. Pe. 2, 24., that thou mightest recouer the peace of soules for such as are healed by thy stripes, and obteine the true righteousnes for as manie as beleeue on thee, that the wrath of thine eternal Father Psal. 2, 12., which is a consuming fire, doe not deuour vs.
               O Iesu Christ, sonne of the liuing God, for these torments, &amp; al other thy passions, we wil honor, praise, and thanke thee for euermore, beseeching thee most humblie, that thy passions may worke and take effect in vs, and be a present &amp; most wholesome medicine in al necessities; and that alwaies being mindful of the same, we may reioice therein Gal. 6, 14.; make it a comfort for our selues against al the tentations of Satan, and the force of sinne &amp; the Law: that thy crosse may be an ensample to vs 1. Pet. 2, 21. that walking in thy steps, we render not rebuke for rebuke, but may imitate thy long suffering Luke. 23, verse. 34. Actes. 7, 60., and praie for such as curse vs Mat. 5, 44. Luke. 6, 28. 1. Cor. 4, 13. 1. Pet. 4, 14.; and finallie, may so thinke vpon, and celebrate the cause of thy death, that the consideration thereof may vtterlie both extinguish al



the flames of vnlawful concupiscence, and burie the enticements of the flesh, and also raise vp the seede of godlines, and nourish the loue of virtue within vs, that so being wholie dead vnto sinne, we may liue vnto righteousnes, &amp; serue thee which barest our sinnes in thy bodie 1. Pet. 2, 24 vpon the crosse, but liuest now and raignest with the Father in the vnitie of the holie Spirit, a God for euermore,
               Amen.
            
            
               3. A praier for true repentance.
               
               
                  O Lord God, which artful of compassion Psa. 103, 8. Exod. 34, 6., &amp; mercie, long suffering, and of great goodnes, thou continuest thy mercie for thousands Ezo. 20, 6., taking awaie iniquitie, sinnes, and offences; thou callest vs after thy woonted mercie by thy worde to repentance, and hartie conuersion. For vnto al, and euerie one is repentance and forgiuenes of sinnes preached Luk. 24, 47 in thy Name.
               Moreouer, we knowe the riches



of thy lenitie Rom. 2, 4. 2. Pet. 3, 9., patience, and long suffering in this, that thou dost not suddainelie at vnawares take awaie sinners from the earth, neither ouerwhelme them by &amp; by, through thy iustice in their wicked deedes doing; but giuest them a space to repent: which is a most notable argument, that thou wilt not the death of a sinner Eze. 33, 11., but rather that he be conuerted, and liue.
               For thou art merciful ouer al, because thou canst al Wis. 12, 16., and dissemblest the sinnes of men for their amendment.
               Thou louest al things that are Wis. 12, 13▪
                  , and abhorrest nothing which thou hast made, neither hast thou ordained any thing which thou doest hate, but sparest al, because they are thine, O Lord, louer of our soules.
               Therefore doe we certainlie beleeue that the promise of free reconciliation is vniuersal, and belongeth to al conuerted.
               O how good and pleasant is thy Spirit, Lord, in al things, therefore dost thou manie times punish such as go astraie, that being warned of their faults, they may depart from



their wickednes Wisd. 12, verse. 20., and beleeue in thee: Thou callest offenders into the waie by affliction, and by iudgeing dost thou by little &amp; little giue place for amendment Wis. 12, 10 knowing fulwel what the generation and corruption of man is, and how it may be reduced.
               O thou masterer of power, with great moderation dost thou iudge mankind, and after this maner dost thou teach thy people, that they should be righteous, and hast made them children of a good hope Wis. 12, 19.
               Moreouer, for a caution, and instruction to vs thou doest many waies Wis. 12, 21 scourge our enimies, that thereby we may consider of thy goodnes, &amp; also being iudged may trust in thy mercie.
               Vnto thee, most merciful God, do we crie, which knowest the hardnes of our harts, &amp; that, through original sinne our harts being hardened, we haue no power of our selues to returne and rise vp:
               Conuert vs, O Lord, Ier. 31, 18. and we shal be conuerted, because thou art our God, and being conuerted we wil doe penance.
               
                  Shew vs our offences, that strikingIere. 31, 19. our thighes we may be hartily sorie for our sinnes committed.
               Heale vs, O Lord, and we shal be whole; saue vs, and we shal be saued Ier. 17, 14.: for thou art our praise.
               Behold we are as a sheepe Psal. 119, vers the last. wandering, and readie to perish, seeke thy seruants, O Lord, that we forget not thy commandements. Circumcise Iere. 4, 4. the foreskin of our vnderstanding, that our harts be not hardened.
               O Iesu Christ, looke vpon vs with thine eies of pittie; euen as thou lookedst back vpon the sinful woman Luke. 7. vers. 37, &amp;c. in the banket, which prostrating hirselfe at thy feete, bitterly did bewaile hir wickednes. Likewise fauor vs as thou didst the Publican Luk. 18, 13, standing a far of in the Temple without lifting vp his eies vnto heauen for shame, but striking his brest onelie saide, Lord be merciful vnto me a sinner.
               Grant that among the feares and terrors of conscience we may take hold of thee by a liuely faith (which hast redeemed vs from the curse of the Lawe Gal. 3, 13., and art made for vs



wisedome 1. Cor. 1, 30 Ier. 23, 5, 6. Ierem. 9. 24., and righteousnes, and sanctification, and redemption) and may not, in the fight of conscience, yeeld our selues, and dispaire, but vpholden by the voice of the Gospel may flie vnto thee our Mediator, and iustified by faith Rom. 5, 1. may haue peace with God.
               Restore also in vs the right of thy lawe, so that from our harts we may obeie thee our Redeemer, walking in newnes of life Rom. 6, 4. 1. Cor. 6, 14..
               Thou which hast suffered for vs in the flesh 1. Pet. 4, 1. 2. Coloss. 3, 5. Rom. 6, 17. giue vs grace that likewise in the same minde we may be armed for the mortification of the flesh, that henceforth we liue, not after the lustes of men, but after the wil of God. For it is sufficient for vs 1. Pet. 4, 3. that we haue spent the time that is past of the life after the wil of the Gentils, walking in wantonnes, lusts, in excesse of wynes, in excesse of eating, in excesse of drinking, and abominable Idolatries.
               Mollifie our harts Rom. 2, 5. 4. that they may repent, and esteeme greatlie of the riches of thy goodnes.
               Moreouer, represse hypocrites, which flatter their affections and



extenuate the inner euils sticking in our nature, and iudge falselie of thy lawe, not knowing that the lawe is spiritual Rom. 7, 14, accusing euen our inclination to be euil.
               Keepe the Diuel vnder that he compel not the trobled consciences of some to desperation, either by heaping, and reaping vp their offences, or extenuating thy mercie: but grant that al sinners may come vnto thee by hearing thy worde to repentance Luk. 15, 7. 10., that the Angels in heauen may continuallie haue occasion to reioice,
               Amen.
            
            
               4. A praier for Christian patience.
               
               
                  O Omnipotent and eternal God, Father of our Lord Iesu Christ, which art the comfort of the afflicted, the ioie of the trobled, of the forlorne the stay, and our refuge in the time of troble, the God of patience Rom. 15, 5. and consolation:
               Thou knowest the weakenes of our flesh, that we are by nature



feareful, &amp; of no courage, so that in crosses and calamities we are not able to stand of our owne strength.
               Wherefore vnfaine dlie, and from the hart we crie vnto thee, Keepe vs vnder miseries and crosses in faith sound Titus. 2, 2., stedfast in hope, and in patience constant, that with quiet mindes, and a valiant courage we may suffer al iniuries and aduersitie; and neuer, being broken with sorow attempt that which is contrarie to thy commandements, but by acknowledging thy wil, may beare al sortes of calamities with calling for thine assistance Psal. 50, 15..
               Poure into vs godlie cogitations, so that we imagine not, that the miseries and afflictions in this worlde, light vpon vs by chance, &amp; against thy wil: but that the Church is gouerned by thy prouidence, and without thy permission that none euil Amos. 3, 6. (of punishment) commeth, but thou sendest the same.
               Gouerne thou our minds, that we imagine at no time thee to be our enimie, when we are pinched with aduersitie: but may beleeue that we are chastined of thy good and fatherlie



purpose for the remnants of sinne abiding in this corrupted nature of ours, thereby to be stirred vp, and confirmed in the exercises of contrition, faith, confession, patience, and other like virtues.
               Certes it is to be accounted for an exceeding benefit that thou sufferest not sinners to followe their owne minds 2. Macc. 6, verse. 13.; but thou withdrawest them by punishment from their impietie, least that liuing after their owne minds, and doing al things as they list, they perish in their wickednes:
               And therefore doest not thou wink14. alwaies at our sinnes, O GOD, as thou dost at the offences of other nations, which thou sufferest to fil the measure of their iniquities, that so afterward at the ripenes of their offences thou maist be reuenged vpon them, and destroie them vtterlie in the daie of iudgement, and of reuengement:
               But our iniquities thou dost visite15. by &amp; by with the rod of correction, and our wickednes with the whip of affliction.
               Notwithstanding thou wilt not16.


                  
vtterlie take awaie thy mercie from vs. Though thou punishest with aduersitie: yet dost thou not forsake thy people.
               Furthermore it is expedient that our coltish flesh be humbled, and brought vnder, and kept in awe. For otherwise hauing the head it wil waxe ouerlustie, and cast of the yoke of the Lorde, being of it selfe slowe, our life fraile, and prosperitie wearieng our minds, and making euen the wisest, and most godlie many times sluggish and headdie.
               But the trobled soule is nigh vnto thee in the crosse, and praier is then most effectual, when it is exercised in affliction.
               For the minde vtterlie destitute of al other helpe of second causes wherevnto it woulde easilie cleaue, then doth open it selfe before thee, and wholie dependeth vpon thee, not trusting in it selfe, but altogether in thee, O God, which raisest the dead 2. Cor. 1, 9. to life: and so our faith is founde more precious than any gold that perisheth 1. Pet. 1, 7., to the praise, and glorie of thy Name.
               Finallie it behooueth vs at the



length to be conformed like the bodie of Christ in his passion, that suffering with him we may also raigne together with him Rom. 8, 17 as his felowe heires.
               For vnles we be wearie of this life, we shal not easelie aspire to our celestial countrie. For which cause it is thy wil that by many tribulations Act. 14, 22. we must enter into the kingdome of heauen.
               Wherefore we beseech thee giue vs godlie minds, that we wonder not 1. Pe. 4, 12. when we are tried by the fire, as though a strange thing did happen vnto vs, but rather let vs reioice, that we are partakers of the afflictions of Christ, that when his glorie appeareth we may be merie and glad.
               Assist vs, that through patience Heb. 12, 1. we may runne to the battel that is before vs looking vnto Iesus the Captaine, and finisher of our faith,2. who for the ioie that was set before him, endured the most shameful crosse:
               Let vs beare in minde that he3. endured such speaking against him of sinners, that we should not be weried



and faint in our minds: but strengthened with al might Col. 1, 11. through thy glorious power vnto al patience and suffering, to continue vnmooueable in al tentations, neuer casting awaie our confidence Heb. 10, 35 which hath a great recompence appointed.
               For we haue neede of patience,36. that after we haue done the wil of God, we may receiue the promise. For yet a litle while Hab. 2, 3. and he that shal come, wil come, and wil not tarie.
               O blessed God, and Father of our Lorde Iesu Christ 2. Cor. 1, 3. which art the Father of mercie, and God of al consolation, comfort vs in al our afflictions, that as the5. afflictions of Christ doe abound with vs, so with al by him our consolation may abounde,
               Amen.
            
            
               
               5. A praier for women with child, and in childbed.
               
                  O Most wise God, eternal Father of thy beloued sonne our Lord and Sauior Christ, Creator, and keeper of al thy creatures, which through thine excellent wisedome, &amp; counsaile, hast enioined to womankind, that in paine and sorow they should bring forth children Gen. 3, 16. whereby not onelie this world is replenished, but a Church, which doth celebrate thy Name for euer, is gathered vnto thee:
               And forasmuch as the paine of a woman in trauel is most extreeme which makes the Prophets Esai. 13, 8. Mica. 4, 10. Esai. 26, 17. many times to repeate the same in exaggerating the afflictions of punishment which the holie Spirit doth threaten vnto the impenitent:
               We beseech thee in the Name of Christ thy Sonne, be merciful vnto al women either with child, or in



childbed: giue them grace to cal into minde the decree and pleasure of thine heauenlie wil: let them neuer striue against thee through impatience, but in true faith and inuocation of thy Name suffer thy crosse quietlie, knowing that by the seede of the woman, which hath broken the old serpents head Gen. 3. 15. they are reconciled vnto thee: In this seede, which is Christ, the curse is cleane taken awaie Galat. 3, 8. 14., and blessing restored to vs, that we may receiue the promise of the Spirit, and the inheritance of eternal life.
               O Almightie God, conuert now the sorowes of women in trauel into gladnes, that they remember not their paines with mourning, for ioie that a man childe is borne into the world Ioh. 16, 21..
               Comfort them in the middes of their anguish, and helpe aswel the mother as the babe, especialie in the danger of deliuerance 2. Kin. 19, 3 Esaie. 37, 3..
               If thou blessed God, be not present, they perish vndoubtedlie, al the worlde cannot helpe them in that extremitie.
               O eternal God, which of the seed



of man framest the liuing infant in the mothers wombe Wisd. 7, 2.; and nourishest the same congealed in blood, that the flesh within the time of ten monethes may take shape, drawing nourishment from the mother; we are 2. Esd. 8, 7. al the workmanship of thine handes.
               We giue thee thankes, Lord: for fearefullie Ps. 139, 14. &amp; wonderfullie are we made: maruelous are thy workes, and that our soules knowe right wel.
               Our bones are not hid from thee,15. though we were secretlie made, neither our substance in the inner parts of our mothers wombe.
               Thine eies did see our substance16. being vnperfect, and in thy booke were al our members written.
               Thy hands haue made vs Iob. 10, 8., and facioned vs altogether: with skin and bones hast thou couered vs,10. and ioined vs together with bones and sinewes; thou hast giuen vs life12. and grace, and thy visitation hath preserued our spirits.
               Grant, we beseech thee, to al infants yet vnborne, that knit together with their due vaines and



members, they may come forth into this worlde sounde and perfect without fault or deformitie.
               Staie the furiousnes of wicked spirits, that they shewe not their tyrannie vpon yong infants.
               Keepe al with child, that, no waie being terrefied, or trobled extreemelie, they be vntimelie deliuered.
               Giue grace also to the babes newlie borne, that, together with their outward baptisme, they may be receiued into the congregation of the faithful, with wholesome water through the renuing and regeneration of the holie Spirit Titus 3, 5., which thou wilt plenteouslie poure vpon them, through Iesus Christ our Sauior; that being iustified by grace,7. they may be made heires according to the hope of eternal life, and become new creatures through him.
               Strengthen al women deliuered, that being restored to their woonted health, they may glorifie thee their helper in the time of neede 2. Cor. 1, 4, &amp; learne afterward to repose their whole confidence in thee, which art



nigh vnto al that cal vpon thee Ps. 145, 18., to al, we saie, calling vpon thee in truth.
               And if at any time through thine vnsearchable iudgement, an vntimelie birth, or (if, without offending thy godhead, we may saie) vnluckie deliuerance happen: so comfort, O merciful GOD, the mourneful &amp; sad parents, that they faint not with sorow, but beleeue rather that the woful chance is a trial of their faith 1. Pet. 1, 7., hope, and patience.
               For thou art a merciful, and gratious God, forgiuing our sinnes. Though thou art angrie with our wickednes: yet in thy displeasure thou remembrest thy mercie, that the trobled may take comfort Hab. 3, 16. and the afflicted finde grace.
               For thus doe al thy seruants perswade themselues, that, if they be tried Tob. 3, 21., they shal be crowned; if they be trobled, they shal be deliuered; and if they be chastened, they shal be saued.
               For thou hast no pleasure in our22. damnation, which bringest faire weather after stormes, and gladnes after teares.
               
                  Thy Name, O Lord, be praisedTobit. 3, 23. for euer,
               Amen.
            
            
               6. A praier for captiues.
               
                  O Lorde our gouernor, thou hast prepared thy seate in the heauens Ps. 103, 19, thy kingdome Ps. 145, 13. is an euerlasting kingdome, and thy dominion endureth throughout al ages. In thine hande is strength and auctoritie: none can resist thy power.
               We beseech thee, be merciful vnto al in captiuitie, and oppressed with most greeuous slauerie; especiallie vnto such, as for the confession of thy Gospel, doe suffer persecution, banishment, imprisonment, perils of life, of good name, and of goodes: comfort them with thy Spirit, deliuer them from cruel bondes by thy diuine power, and grant such lawful meanes according to thy wisedome Psa. 147, 5., that thy faithful may be deliuered.
               O Lorde, bring home thy captiues exiled for thy Name sake Esai. 11, 11., that they may confesse thee, and



extol thy goodnes.
               O that God woulde heare the mournings of the imprisoned Ps. 102, 20., and deliuer the sonnes appointed vnto death.
               O that God would bring home the captiuitie of his people: then should we be like such as dreame Psa. 126, 1., and our mouthes shoulde be filled2. with laughter, and our tong with ioie. Then should they saie among the Gentils, The Lord hath done3. great things for them; yea, the Lord hath dealt maruelouslie with vs, we are made iocond.
               Turne our captiuitie, O Lord, as4. the riuers in the South. For thou alone art our assister of whom commeth saluation Psa. 68, 20, thou deliuerest such as are bounde by thy power, and despisest not the groanings of the afflicted.
               Praised be God continuallie Psa. 68, 19., which helpeth vs, and poureth out his benefits vpon vs, which letteth loose his captiues, and that without gifts or rewarde Esai. 45, 13 freelie for his holie Name sake.
               Therefore shal the people worship thee, O Lord, and praie vnto



thee: for thou saiest vnto the bound, Come out; and to those that sit in darknes, Come to light.
               O Lord, cal into minde thy manifold mercies; deale with vs according to thy woonted goodnes, and giue not thine inheritance into the hands of thine enimies, least they make sale of vs, and spoile our lande.
               Forgiue our sinnes, and transgressions; let not aliens haue dominion ouer vs Lament. 1, verse. 5, &amp;c., neither let our houses passe vnto strangers; let vs not be as exiles, and pupils without a Father; neither our mothers, as widowes without husbands; let not our old men be wanting in our ports, nor yet our coūtrie lament for the waste which the enimie would make.
               Heale the sorrowes of the daughter of thy people, and be merciful to our sinnes, for the glorie of thy Name sake.
               Breake thou the chaines of the imprisoned, and deliuer such as are bound with manacles and fetters; cast of their yoke that they may praise thee for euer.
               Bring them out of darknes Ps. 107, 14. and



the shadow of death; Breake the gates of brasse, and smite the barsPsal. 107, 16. of iron in sunder, that they may know that thou art their Lorde, when thou hast broken the bonds of their yoke Ezec. 34, verse. 27., and deliuered them out of the hands of those that serued themselues.
               But if it be thy wil for the trial of their faith and pacience to detaine some in exile and seruitude a longer time: then comfort such with thy spirit, and mitigate their paines, that they may finde fauor in the sight of them Baru. 1, 12. whom they are compelled to serue, and cast not them of for euer.
               Aboue al, keepe them in the confession of true faith, and Christian religion, against al false worshippings, that so they may comfort themselues with the gratious pardoning of their sinnes through Christ, and their harts may be sealed with the earnest of the holie Spirit bearing witnes to their spirits that they are deliuered from perpetual captiuitie and bondage of hel.
               O Christ our Redeemer, deliuer our soules from the chaines of darknes,



and snares of death, which sufferedst thy selfe to be bound, that thou mightest vnloose the most hard bands and knots of our transgressions: and wast sent of thine eternal Father into this world to preach libertie vnto captiues Esai, 61, 1. and deliuerance to such as are shut vp:
               Grant, that being entangled with the cordes of iniquitie, we giue not our members as weapons of vnrighteousnes vnto sinne Rom. 6, 13. Breake in peeces the chaines of Satan, and turne vs into thy flock, that none vnrighteousnes haue dominion ouer14. vs.
               Deliuer him that is in bondage vnto Satan, and bring forth the bound by the blood of thy couenant out of the pit wherein is no water Zach. 9, 11 that he▪ spoile and kil vs not.
               Giue grace also, that being snarled with humane traditions Colos. 2, 8. we entrap not our consciences by false opinions: but may serue thee our true God in Christian libertie, and neuer abuse the same to the offence of any.
               Take vs miserable men out of the



bodie of this death Rom. 7, 24, which maketh vs captiues to the lawe of sinne, which is in our members, that deliuered from sinne and death we may23. serue thee in true vprightnes and euerlasting life, which raignest for euer one God in the trinitie of persons,
               Amen.
            
            
               7. A praier against the tentation of the flesh.
               
               
                  O Merciful God, we miserable men acknowledge &amp; confesse that in vs Rom. 7, 18. that is in our flesh there dwelleth no good thing.
               But in sinne we were borne Psal. 51, 5., and our mothers conceaued vs of corrupt seede.
               For our nature is defiled, and prone vnto al wickednes euen from our youth Gen. 8, 21.: so that by the strength of our proper reason we cannot sauor those thinges which belong to the Spirit.
               For the natural man 1. Cor. 2, 14 speaketh, and fauoreth of earthlie things, and of himselfe is not meete so much as



to thinke anie thing that good is without the assistance of thy power:
               Vnto thee doe we crie with our whole harts, that it woulde please thee to open vnto vs by thy Spirit the true knowledge of thine essence and wil, as thou hast reuealed thy selfe in thy worde, that we may not folow the sence of our flesh in iudging of spiritual things; neither by our blinde baiardlie reason, measure thine heauenlie saiengs.
               For blood and flesh perceiue not the things which belong to the Spirit, and the fleshlie mind is enmitie against God Rom. 8, 7. for it is not obedient vnto the Lawe, neither can be. And they which are in the flesh cannot8. please God.
               Seing therefore that in vs abideth the seede of sinne, which is concupiscence; and a proanes vnto wickednes is ingraffed into vs by nature, yea, and original sin through our first parents, doth oftentimes prick vs vnto impietie. For euerie one is tempted Iam. 1, 14. when he is drawen awaie, and enticed with the baite of his owne concupiscence, then when lust hath conceaued it bringeth15.


                  
forth sinne, and sinne when it is furnished, bringeth forth death:
               Giue vs grace that we folow not the concupiscence of our flesh, neither prouoke our sences by vnbrideled libertie, but stoutlie to resist them.
               For vnles that wicked concupiscence be driuen from our mindes it wil neuer cesse til it haue brought forth deadlie sinne.
               Wherefore assist vs that we may tame these bodies of ours, &amp; bring them into subiection 1. Cor. 9, verse. 27., least our flesh being ouerlustie doe offende, and ouerpasse the prescribed limits.
               Assist vs, we beseech thee, to crucifie our flesh Gal. 5, 24 with al the affections and desires thereof, for the better seruing thee, and walking in the Spirit.
               For we are debtors Rom. 8, 12, not to the flesh, to liue after the flesh, but, the deedes of the flesh being mortified, to liue renued Eph. 4, 23. after the holie Spirit in righteousnes and true holines.
               Sanctifie vs Ioh 17, 17., holie Father, that we defile not our selues with carnal vices, with riotousnes, bellicheere; nor by vnlawful pleasure, casting of



thine holie Spirit, that we make our bodies the houses of filthie feends, which carie awaie, and cast headlong al intemperate and secure persons into euerlasting destruction.
               Be it far from vs, that we make our members the members of harlots 1. Cor. 6, verse. 15., whereby thy holie Spirit is banished, and man becommeth a denne for theeues, and a sink of filthines.
               Gouerne vs, that we may shun the works of the flesh Gal. 5, 19., and be careful to doe the works of the Spirit 1. Cor. 6, 9., as thy chosen seruants.
               And forasmuch as the flesh lusteth against the Spirit Gal. 5, 17., and the Spirit contrarie to the flesh (for they are contrarie, and continuallie striue together): be thou merciful vnto vs, O God, helpe vs with thy diuine power, that the holie Spirit (which thou didst poure into vs at our baptisme) may beare the rule in our members, and preuaile ouer the flesh, and al the affections of the same.
               Extinguish the flames of carnal desires, and represse our raging lustes: so shal we auoide enormous



offences, and shun the wicked actions of our owne inuentions.
               And if at any time, being subdued by flesh and blood, we shal wander from the path, and direction of the Spirit to something vnseemelie for our calling, impute not, we praie thee, that fault vnto vs, but remember that we are flesh, and conuert vs by thy diuine power.
               And seeing that flesh of itselfe is vnbridelie, and wilde, not abiding correction, but is like a fat &amp; wanton calfe Ier. 46, 21., which is not vsed to labor: put thy yoke vpon vs, &amp; tame our flesh by thy Spirit, that walking soberlie and modestlie we may bridle the same, and humble it vnder thy commandements by withdrawing of delicious fare. For with ouermuch fine fare our mindes waxe wanton and ouerlustie.
               Aide vs, that by temperance, moderation, &amp; abstinence from superfluous meats &amp; drinks, we may bind our flesh to the direction of the holie Spirit, and mortifie our bodies of sinne: so shal we praise and magnifie thy Name, which liuest in vs worlds without ende,
               Amen.

                  WE wil praise thee, O eternal God, Father of our Lorde IESV Christ, for maruelous things hast thou done for vs; thou hast deliuered our soules from death, and our feete from falling Psa. 56, 13..
               Blessed be God which hath heard our praiers Psal 40, 1. 2.; and brought vs out of the lake of miserie, out of the myre and claie: which set our feete vpon the rock, and ordered our goings, which hath saued vs this daie from al perils, and comforted our soules.
               Wherefore we wil extol thee, and celebrate thy Name euerie daie; and at night wil we talke of thy righteousnes.
               We wil magnifie the Lord our God, and bow our selues at his footestoole Psal. 99, 5., for he is holie.
               We wil praise thee, O Lord, because thou hast set vs vp Psal. 30, 1., and hast not made our foes to triumph



ouer vs. Thou hast brought ourPsal. 30, 3. soules from hel, and saued our liues from them that go downe into the pit. Wherefore we wil sing4. praises vnto thee, and yeelde thee thanks, for a remembrance of thy holines.
               O most louing Father, here prostrating our selues before thy feete, we beseech thee in the Name of thy Sonne, who suffered for vs a most cruel death, blot out al our transgressions, whereby we haue offended thy Maiestie, and especiallie those which this day we haue committed.
               Be merciful vnto vs, O Lord, for thy Name sake. For greatlie haue we sinned A part of the praier of King Manasses placed immediatlie after the second booke of Chron. according to the Geneua translation., and our offences are mo than the sande of the sea. We haue prouoked thee vnto anger, and done euil in thy sight. But now we bend the knees of our hart, requiring thy mercie. O Lord, we haue sinned, we acknowledge our sinnes with griefe and sorow. Pardon, O pardon our sinnes, and destroie vs not together with our iniquities, neither reserue euil for vs for euer: but of thine infinit goodnes



saue vs miserable and most vnworthie men. For thou, O Lord, according to thy wonted mercie hast promised forgiuenes of sinnes to al repenters. Therefore we wil praise thee continuallie al the daies of our life; al the host of heauen praise thee worldes without end.
               Who is such a God as thou Mic. 7, 18., that pardonest wickednes, and forgiuest the offences of the remnant of thine heritage? Thou keepest not thy wrath for euer, for thy delight is in mercie. Thou turnest againe,19. and art merciful vnto vs; thou puttest downe our wickednes, &amp; castest al our sinnes into the bottome of the sea.
               In this euening now the Sunne is gone, we praie thee, O God, depart not from vs, which art the Sunne of righteousnes, neither let thine aide be far from vs, but abide with vs, O Lord, for it draweth toward night, and the daie is far spent Luke. 24, verse. 29..
               Forsake vs not, O Lord our God Psa. 38, 21., neither depart from vs; for tribulation is at hand Psa 22, 11., and there is none to helpe.
               O GOD of our saluation, make



haste to helpe vs, haue a regard to our defence, &amp; redeeme our soules in peace Psa. 55, 18. from those that war against vs.
               Deliuer vs from such as marke our goings. Plucke our feete out of the snare, and leade vs in the path of righteousnes, that our feete slip not, and we take a fal.
               Guide vs by thy wisedome, that when we walke it may leade vs Pro. 6, 22., when we sleepe it may keepe our feete, and when we wake we may talke thereof.
               And therefore sleeping we wil not feare, but rest quietlie, and our sleepe shal be sweete; we wil not quake at the sudden terror, neither at the ranging of the vngodly when it happeneth. The Lord shal be on our side, and protect our feete that we be not taken, yea, the Lord shal be our light, and saluation in darknes. He is our hope Psal. 91, 9. which hath appointed vs so high a refuge. Let none euil come vnto vs, neither suffer10. the whip to be nigh our tabernacle.
               O Lord be thou our watchman and protector that trobles &amp; vaine



cogitations doe not inuade vs, and neither the feare of death ouerwhelme vs Eccl. 40, 5., nor the sleepe of night alter our thoughtes, and vnderstanding when we should take our rest, and ease in our chambers, but grant vs a good &amp; quiet sleepe, and after the same to rise vp in the morning and to render due thanks and praise to thee our most merciful protector.
               For Psa. 121, 2. our helpe is from the Lord which hath made both heauen and earth. He wil not suffer our feete to3. be mooued: and he that keepeth Israël wil not sleepe, to whom be praise now, and euermore,

Pet. 2, 9., a roial priesthood, to offer acceptable sacrifices vnto thee: Receiue now the sacrifice of praise from our mouthes 2 Mach. 1, verse. 26., for thy benefites conferred vpon vs.
               We thanke thee, O eternal God, not onlie for keeping vs this night passed, but also for defending vs this whole weeke, yea, and al our life time from the snares of wicked spirits,



that they could not circumuent, and ouerthrow vs.
               We wil praise thee, O Lord with our whole hart Psal. 9, 1., we wil speake of al thy maruelous works; we wil be glad and reioice in thee. Our songs wil2. we make of thy Name, O thou most Hie, which exaltest vs from the gates of death, that we may declare al thy praises in the portes of thy Churches, we wil exceedinglie reioice in thy saluation.
               Blessed be the Lorde God of Israel Luk. 1, 68., because he hath visited and redeemed his people; And hath raised vp an horne of saluation vnto69. vs, and deliuered vs from our enimies, and from the hande of al that hate vs. He hath bin merciful vnto71. vs, in lightening those which sat in79. darknes and in the shadow of death to direct our feete into the waie of peace.
               To thee doe we offer the sacrifice of praise Heb. 13, 15, that is the frute of lips Hose. 14, 3, confessing thy Name. Our mouthes shal praise thee, O Lord, and our tongues declare thy righteousnes.
               Lo, we wil not refraine our lips,



O Lord, &amp; that thou knowest Psa. 40, 10., yea, we wil lift vp our hands vnto thy sanctuarie, and with our feete wil we hasten towards thine house, and in thy Congregation we wil praise thee.
               We wil magnifie thee, O God our King Psa. 145, 1., and will blesse thy Name for euer and euer.
               Euerie daie wil we giue thankes2. vnto thee, and praise thy Name perpetuallie.
               For great art thou, O Lord, and3. maruelous worthie to be praised, there is none ende of thy greatnes.
               Al generations shal extol thy4. workes, and speake of thy power: they shal talke of thy worship, glorie,5. praise and wonderous workes,6. and we wil declare thy mightines.
               The memorial of thine abundant7. kindnes shal be shewed, and men shal sing of thy righteousnes.
               The Lord is gratious and merciful,8. long suffering, and of great goodnes.
               The Lord is louing vnto euerie9. man, and his mercie is ouer al his works.
               Al thy works praise thee, O Lord,10.


                  
and thy Saints giue thanks vnto thee from one generation to another.
               O God, earelie now this morning doe we cal for thine vnspeakeable mercie, beseeching thee from the bottome of our hart, that this morning thou wilt lighten our minds, so that the shining &amp; brightnes of thy knowledge may rise in vs, which are called out of darknes 1. Pet. 2, 9. into the maruelous light of thy glorie, that, being awaked out of sleepe Rom. 13, verse. 11., we may giue our selues to the works of light, and walke honestlie, as in the daie, not in rioting and dronkennes, neither13. in chambering and wantonnes, neither in strife, and enuieng. For we beleeuers are the children of light 1. Thes. 5, 5 and of the daie, not of night, and of darknes. Therefore giue vs grace, that we sleepe not, as6. others doe, but make vs to watch, and be sober, putting on the brestplate8. of faith and charitie, and for an helmet to take the hope of saluation.9. For thou God hast not ordeined vs to wrath, but to obteine saluation through our Lorde Iesus Christ which died for vs.
               
                  Giue vs grace likewise, we beseech thee, that we abuse not this daie and other thy creatures Rom. 8, 20 vnto vanitie, neither giue our members Rom. 6, 13 as instruments vnto sinne, by doing such deedes as fight against the soule 1. Pet. 2, 11, wounde the conscience, and greeue the same.
               Succour vs, gratious God, that painefullie we may shunne and auoide sixe things which thou doest hate Pro. 6, 16., yea, seauen which thy soule doth abhor, to wit, a proude looke, a lieng tong, hands that shed innocent17. blood, an hart that goeth about wicked imaginations, feete18. that be swift in running to mischiefe, a false witnes which bringeth19. forth lies; and him that soweth discord among brethren.
               O Lord, God of our saluation, into thine hands wil we deliuer our harts, that earelie they may watch to thee our maker Eccl. 39, 5., and in thy sight wil we praie that thou maist protect vs in the daie of troble.
               In sixe calamities deliuer vs, O Lord, and Iob. 5, 19. in the seuenth let none euil come to vs; in famine saue vs from death; in battel frō the power20.


                  
of the sworde; hide vs from theIob. 5, 21. scourge of the tong; when destruction commeth let vs not feare; in dearth make vs merie; and let not22. the beasts of the earth apale our courage. Grant this, O Father, for thy deere Sonne our Sauior Christs sake,
               Amen.
            
            
               2. A thankesgiuing to God for his mercies.
               
               
                  O Most holie Trinitie, which art the true &amp; eternal Vnitie, of equal glorie and maiesty, we worship thee, we praise thee, we thanke thee for al thy benefits, as it is truelie meete, iust, and good for vs alwaies to giue thanks vnto thee.
               O Lord most holie, eternal God, and Almightie Father through Christ our Lorde, by whom Angels praise thee, Kings adore thee, and powers doe feare thee: the heauens, and heauen of heauens, yea the blessed Seraphins Esaie. 6, 2. 3. Reuel. 4, 8. with ioie together doe magnifie thee, saieng with humble confession, Holie, Holie,



Holie, Lord God of Sabaorh, the whole earth is ful of thy glorie.
               Especiallie at this time, O Father most Hie, we thanke thee for thy mercie abunding toward vs, which of thy great loue Ephe. 2, 4. wherewith thou louedst vs, yea, when we were dead through sinne, didst quicken vs together5. with Christ, and being raised with him hast made vs to sit together6. in heauenlie things, thereby to shew to al ages hereafter the exceeding7. riches of thy grace in thy8. kindnes toward vs through Iesus Christ. For by grace are we saued9. through faith, and that not of our selues, it is the gift of God, not of workes, least anie man should boast. Besides, thou hast by thine holie10. Spirit sealed and prepared vs vnto good workes which thou didst before ordeine that we might walke in them, and please thee in newe obedience.
               We wil declare the goodnes of the Lord Esai. 63, 7., yea, and praise the Lord for al that he hath giuen vs.
               Great is thy mercie, O Lord, and thy goodnes incomparable toward vs.
               
                  Who shal be able to expresse thy workes? or who can seeke out the grounde of thy noble actes Eccl. 18, 3.? who shal declare the power of thy greatnes? or take vpon him to tel out thy4. mercie? which is such, and so infinite,5. that it can neither be augmented, nor diminished.
               For Ps. 103, 11. looke how hie the Heauen is in comparison of the earth: so great is thy mercie also towardes them which feare thee. And as far as the East is from the West: so far12. hast thou set our sinnes from vs.
               For as a Father pittieth his owne13. children: euen so art thou merciful to al which feare thee.
               Yea, though a Mother doe forget hir infant Esai. 49, 15, and take no pittie on the sonne of hir wombe, yet wilt not thou forget vs; for we are written16. vpon thine hands.
               The mercie of the Lord is vnchangeable, infinite, and neuer faileth Lam. 3, 22. 23., but dailie ariseth newe and fresh vpon vs.
               The merciful goodnes of the Lord endureth for euer and euer Ps. 103, 17. vpon them which feare him, &amp; his righteousnes vpon childers children,18.


                  
such as keepe his couenants, and thinke vpon his commandements to doe them.
               Thy mercie is on such as feare thee Luk. 1, 50. from generation to generation.
               The mercie that a man hath Ecc. 18, 12. reacheth vnto his neighbor, but the mercie of the Lorde is vpon al flesh, chastening, and teaching, and nurturing: yea, euen as a shepheard turneth againe his flock, so doth he al them which receiue chastening, nurture, and doctrine. Merciful art thou vnto al them which receiue13. correction, and diligentlie seeke after thy iudgements.
               And although for a while thou forsakest vs Esai. 54, 7.: yet afterward in much fauor wilt thou gather vs together. In the time of thy wrath thou hidest8. thy face from vs for a little season, but for al that thy mercie towarde vs is euerlasting.
               Blessed be thy Name, O God of our Fathers, which when thou art angrie Tob. 13, 2 shewest mercie, and in the time of troble forgiuest the sinnes of them which cal vpon thee.
               This thy goodnes and ouerabounding



mercie, which hath bin from the beginning and for euer shal continue ouer al which vnfainedlie repent; neuer languishing or failing but abiding perfect alwaies in the highest degree, we wil praise and confesse from one generation to another.
               For gratious and merciful is the Lord, patient, and long suffering Exo. 34, 6. Psal. 103, 8., bent to shew fauor, and meruelouslie gentle towards al that cal vpon him.
               Praise the Lord al ye heathen Psal. 117, 1., and glorifie him al nations. For his merciful kindnes is euer more and2. more toward vs.
               We wil not keepe back thy louing mercie and truth from the great congregation Psa. 40, 10 11.: withdraw not thou thy mercies from vs, O Lorde; let thy kindnes and truth alwaie preserue vs.
               O let thy merciful kindnes be our comfort Psal. 119, verse. 76. according to thy worde vnto thy seruants.
               O deale with thy seruants according to thy great mercie Psal. 119, verse. 124. and teach vs thy statutes, that in like maner we may be merciful toward al men



without respect of persons, or hope of gaine, willinglie without morositie: that in thy iudgement Matt. 5, 7. 24. 44. we may finde mercie through the passion and death of thy sonne Iesus Christ, which liueth &amp; raigneth with thee in the vnitie of the holie Spirit a God worlds without ende,
               Amen.
            
            
               3. A praier for an happie departure out of this worlde.
               
                  O Most gratious God, thy yeares endure throughout al generations Ps. 102, 24, &amp; thy daies are without ende or beginning: but the daies of man surelie are determined which he can not ouerpasse Iob. 14, 5.; and the nomber of his moneths are knowen to thee, thou hast appointed him his bounds which he cannot go beyonde.
               Thou hast nombred our daies, which vade awaie sodainelie like the grasse Psal. 90, 5.. For we are soone dispatched, and easelie consume.
               Our daies are like a shadowe,



                  Ps. 102, 11. and wither awaie like grasse.
               A man in this world is euen like a vapor that vanisheth awaie Iam. 4, 14. 1. Pet. 1, 24. Esaie. 40, 6. Iames. 1, 10. Eccl. 14, 18.. For al flesh is grasse, and al the glorie thereof, as the flower of the fielde, which florisheth in the morning and afterwarde withereth and vadeth.
               Behold Psal. 39, 5. our daies are to be measured, they are as it were a spanne long, and our age is nothing in respect of thee. And verilie euerie man liuing is altogether vanitie.
               Our age is folden together, and taken awaie from vs like a shepherdes cotage Esaie. 38, verse. 12., our life is cut of by our sinnes, like the thred of the weauer, which is sodainlie broke of.

                  de 1. Chr. 29, verse. 15., and soiourners, as were our fathers: our daies on the earth also Psal. 39, 7. Wisdo. 2, 5. are but as a shadow, and we are as nothing in respect of thee.
               Our life speedilie goeth awaie like the weauers shuttle, and it abideth not.
               Wherefore, Lord, let vs know our end Psal. 39, 5. Psa. 119, 84., and the number of our daies, that we may be certified how long we haue to liue, and what is yet to



come.
               Instruct vs, O Lord, that, being alwaies mindful of our mortalitie we neuer promise to our selues manie yeeres, nor long liues in this pilgrimage of ours, so shal we not liue securelie deferring our conuersion to thee from daie to daie, nor yet put confidence in this fraile and vncertaine life, as did that rich man, saieng Luk. 12, 19, Soule, thou hast much good laid vp in store for manie yeeres, take thine ease, eate, drinke, and be merie: Whose soule notwithstanding was taken from him the same night.
               But giue grace, that in thy feare we may dailie prepare o
                     •
                   selues to depart out of this prison. for nothing is more certaine than death, though nothing more vncertaine than the houre thereof.
               Therefore let vs haue alwaies before our eies an image, and meditation of our departure, the better to know the fleeting and vanitie of this combersome and vncertaine life, that we may liue to thee our God, being sounde in faith Titus. 2, 2., and strong in hope, loking Titu. 2, 13. with cherefulnes



for the daie of our departure, &amp; the ioiful appearing of thy Sonne Iesus Christ our Redeeemer: and as long as we abide in this tabernacle of our bodies with al studie ministering 2. Pet. 1, 5. to our faith, virtue; to virtue, knowledge; to knowledge, temperance; to temperance, patience;6. to patience, godlines: vntil this tabernacle 2. Cor. 5,

                   being laid awaie, we shal passe ouer to our dwelling place, not made with hande, but euerlasting in the heauens, where2. we shal be clothed with eternal glorie &amp; immortalitie, when this earthlie house is put of, and destroied.
               Grant also that trusting firmelie to thy promises, we may be readie6. and glad to returne to our euerlasting and celestial country: for while7. we are in this bodie, we wander frō thee our God, for now we walke in faith, not in the enioieng and possession of eternal goodes: wherfore,9. whether we be at home, or from home, let vs endeuor our selues to be acceptable in thy sight.
               Make vs faithful and wise seruants Matth. 24, verse▪ 45. alwaies loking for the comming of our Lord (for we know not



when he wil come, Marke. 13, verse. 35. at the euening, or at midnight, whether at the cock crowing, or in the dawning) least by a suddaine houre of death being ouertaken, and as it were caught in the foulers trap Luk. 21, 35 we be found vnreadie: but contrariwise by prudent watching in true conuersion and repentance may continuallie couet to be dissolued Phili. 1, 23. and to be with Christ our Redeemer.
               Grant also, that at the point of death, hauing escaped al hardnes and tentations, we may triumph like conquerours, and beholde the presence and power of thine holie Spirit; &amp; let our last words be that, which thy Sonne did vtter vpon the altar of the Crosse, saieng Luke. 23, verse. 46. Psal. 31, 5., Father into thine hands I commende my spirit: &amp; when our speech is taken from vs, heare, O God, the groanings of our harts.
               And the houre of death being come, let thy seruants Luk. 2, 29 depart in peace, because our eies haue seene30. 31. thy saluation, which thou hast prepared before the face of al people: a light to be reuealed vnto the Gentiles,32. and the glorie of thy people

                  OMnipotent, and eternal Father, which hast giuen to thy Church certaine promises of corporal things: we thy children crie vnto thee for our dailie bread, and else what pertaining to the sustentation of our mortal bodies.
               Make our fieldes fertile, that the seede sowen may come vp, and our ground yeelde vs a ioieful haruest.
               Prosper thou the labors of al artificers, and let their doings take good successe.
               Blesse, Lorde, the workes of our hands, our heardes of cattel Deu. 28, 4. Psa. 144, 13. 14., and flocks of sheepe, that they may prosper, and encrease, and we feele no barennes, desolation, nor decaie.
               Sende thy blessing into our barnes, and storehouses Deu. 28, 8.. For Pro. 10, 22▪
                   it is the blessing of God that maketh rich, and causeth plentie.
               
                  Except the Lord build the house Psa. 127, 1., their labour is but lost that build it. It is but vaine for vs to rise earlie,2. and late to take rest, eating the bread of sorowe. For thou Lord giuest to thy beloued, sleepe they, wake they, much plentie, &amp; al kind of happines.
               Make vs therfore, bountiful God, to loase our nets in thy Name Luke. 5, 5., and to doe the works of our calling earnestlie with inuocation of thy diuine assistance, that by thy blessing we may haue good successe.
               Protect al waifaring men, and trauelers, either sailing by seas to far countries, or iorneieng by land for our common welfare, that they may safelie returne home againe.
               Take thou the defence of Merchants with their goods and riches Ezech. 27, vers. 27, &amp;c., so shal they be secure from al misfortune. Dispose their minds and wits, that in their trafike they may deale without fraude, couen, and abuse of thy Name, measuring al things according to the rule of iustice, and therby reteine a good conscience Sira. 13, 25. Make them to loue virtue, to keepe promise, to obserue



couenants, that no man oppresse or circumuent his brother 1. Thes. 4, verse. 6., for God is the reuenger of al such.
               Grant also to al buiers of villages, houses, lande, yokes of oxen, that Luk. 14. 18. for the loue and desire of earthlie riches, and filthie lucre, they forget not the kingdome of God, and so make excuse that they cannot come to thy great, and heauenlie supper, wherevnto al men are called by the Gospel. Let them not delight Ps. 62, 10. in wrong doing, and roberie. If riches encrease let not their harts be set vpon them: but afore al thinge prouide for themselues the treasure Mat. 13, 44. hid in the field, and the pretious iewel Matth. 13, verse. 45. of thy celestial kingdome.
               To al workemen and laborers grant that they be faithful in their busines: make them also strong aswel in bodie, as in iudgement.
               Giue vs good seruants, vpright gouernors, an happie state of Commonweale, a wholesome temperature of aire, health, peace, discipline, &amp;c.
               Keepe our mindes from couetousnes, which 1. Tim. 6, verse. 10. is the roote of al



euil, least being bewitched therewithal, we swarue from the faith, and wrap our selues in manie sorrowes. But gouerne vs by thy Spirit, that al our care Mat. 6, 20. Luk. 12, 33. 1. Tim. 6, 19. Psal. 55, 23. may be cast vpon thee our Father, and we be content with dailie bread.
               Blesse vs moreouer that we abuse not thy temporal benefits, neither glut our selues with meate &amp; drinke to the ouercoming of our harts by surfetting, and dronkennes Luke. 21, verse. 34. but may vse thy blessings moderately to our comfort.
               Giue patience to the poore that they neither murmur against thy wil, and their condition, neither enuie their betters, and so offend thee, and breake thy commandements.
               Let not rich men be either high minded 1. Tim. 6, verse. 17., or confident in vncertaine riches, but in thee the liuing God (which giuest to vs abundantly al things to enioie) that they doe18. good, and be rich in good workes, that they be readie to giue, glad to distribute, and laieng vp in store for19. themselues a good foundation against the time to come, that they may obteine eternal life.
               
                  Two things we doe require of thee our God Prou. 30, 7 8. denie them not before we die. Remoue from vs vanitie and lies; giue vs neither pouertie nor riches, onlie grant vs things necessarie for this life: least peraduenture9. being ful we should denie thee, and saie, Who is God? or being oppressed with pouertie we fal to stealing, and take the Name of thee our God in vaine,

               5. A praier for the afflicted, and such as suffer persecution.
               
               
                  O Christ eternal God, which hast commanded vs to denie our selues Luk. 9, 29. Matt. 16, 24. Mark. 8, 34., and dailie to take vp our crosse, &amp; follow thee our capitaine, and maister in much patience.
               For it cannot be auoided, but that al which desire to liue godlie 2. Tim. 3, verse. 12. in thee our Lorde, must suffer persecution.
               And wee cannot be thy seruants and soldiers vnles wee can abide the persecution of the greater part of mankinde. For Satan wil neuer surcesse from arming



his villains with furiousnes against thy members.
               And it falleth out commonlie in this licentious wickednes of the world, that the godlie, euen through the zeale of righteousnes doe purchase to themselues the hatred of the wicked.
               Especiallie it is incident vnto Christians to be abhorred of the maior part of mankinde. For flesh in no case can awaie with the preaching of the Gospel, and none welsuffer the reprehension of their vices.
               Hence arise persecutions for the destruction of the godlie, whereby in no place they can be safe and secure, but their endes are sought by al kindes of crueltie.
               Wherfore we beseech thee, on the behalfe of al persecuted for righteousnes sake Mat. 5, 10. 1. Pet. 3, 14. 1. Pet. 4, 14., against whom despiteful words are vsed, &amp; lies inuented: and for as manie as for thy Name sake are detained in prison, fettered, attainted before counsels Matth. 10, vers. 17, &amp;c., whipped, brought afore Kings and Princes to be tormented with exquisite and diuers punishments for



the confession of true religion: for such as are exiled from their natiue soiles Hebru. 11, vers. 35, &amp;c., banished, spoiled of their goods, abhorred of the world, tried by torments, racked, hanged vpon forkes, vpon wheeles, killed by swords, like sheepe for the slaughter murthered, and throwen out to be deuoured of the rauenous and cruel beasts for thy Gospels sake 1. Pet. 4, 14:
               Al these assist, and laie to thine hande for our strengthening, the glorie and Spirit of God may rest vpon vs, by whose consolation we may suffer al trobles, and by an inuincible courage get the victorie in al these, and neuer fal from the hope of our saluation.
               Grant therefore that we may haue the testimonie of a good conscience, knowing that we are punished vndeseruedlie, not as murtherers 1. Pe. 4, 15., or theeues, or euil doers, or busiebodies in other mens matters. And, suffering as Christians let vs16. not be ashamed, but glorifie God on that behalfe.
               Giue vs grace to account it for exceeding ioie Iame. 1, 2., when we fal into diuers tentations, and afflictions;



and to glorie therein Rom. 5, 3.. For affliction bringeth forth patience; patience,4. experience; experience, hope;5. and hope maketh not ashamed.
               And let their example which before vs did suffer the like in their bodies, be a comfort vnto vs. For so did the vngodlie persecute the Prophets Mat. 5, 12. which were before vs.
               And especiallie thy steps, which are left to be followed 1. Pe. 2, 21. are aboue al to be allowed of. For thou diddest saie Ioh. 15, 20: The seruant is not greater than his maister; if they haue persecuted me, they wil persecute you also.
               Finallie giue grace, that, respecting the vnspeakable reward which of thine onelie mercie thou diddest promise to al which perseuer vnto the ende Mat. 24, 13, by thine assistance we may ouercome al the greeuousnes of affliction.
               For blessed dost thou pronounce them which suffer persecution for righteousnes sake Mat. 5, 10., for theirs is the kingdome of heauen: that, when they are prooued, they may receiue the crowne of life Iam. 1, 12. which thou hast promised to such as loue thee.
               
                  Wherefore indue al in affliction with thy fortitude from aboue, that with a bolde and stoute courage they may reioice Acts. 5, 41. 1. Pet. 4, 13. that they are counted worthie to suffer shame, and al kindes of affliction for thy Name.
               Make them constant in the true confession, that through the consideration of cruel punishment they depart not from the faith, and forsake the profession of true religion.
               Likewise shew forth thine omnipotencie, &amp; with thy mightie hand deliuer them from the power of Tyrans; from the mouthes of Lions Hebru. 11, vers. 33, &amp;c., and violence of fire.
               And as concerning such, whose bodilie deliuerance were not best, but are fittest for martyrdome, those strengthen in the middes of paine, that they feare not such as kil the bodie Mat. 10, 28., but cannot kil the soule; that being afflicted according to thy wil, they may commit the keeping of their soules to thee with wel doing 1. Pet. 4, 19, as vnto a faithful Creator; and so though they leese (as may seeme) their soules in this world: yet shal they find them safe Mat. 16, 25 Luk. 17, 33. and blessed



in another life which is eternal, where thou liuest and raignest with the Father in the vnitie of the holie Spirit, a God for euermore,
               Amen.
            
            
               6. A praier for Widowes, and Orphanes.
               
               
                  O Most merciful, and faithful God, father of orphanes Psal. 68, 5. &amp; iudge of widowes; Looke downe from heauen, thou which considerest our labor, and sorow, and in whose hands al our saluation doth consist.
               The poore is left vnto thee: for thou art the helper of the fatherles Psalm. 10, vers. 14, &amp;c.. The Lord doth heare the desire of the poore, thou preparest their harts, and thine eare harkeneth thervnto: to helpe the fatherles and widowe vnto their right, that the man of the earth be no more exalted against the miserable.
               We beseech thee, O most righteous auenger, haue thou a consideration of al widowes and orphanes, and prouide for them by ministring



clothes &amp; nourishment vnto them, haue pittie on them in al their perils, and necessities; stretch out thine helping hande and deliuer them as thou didest that widowe, whose pitcher of oile 2. King. 4▪ verse. 2, &amp;c. by the Prophet Elias thou didest so encrease with thy blessing, that not onlie she deliuered hir children in bondage for debt out of the hands of hir creditors; but also of the oile she sold, had wherewith to sustaine both hir selfe, and hir children.
               For thou art the Lord which carest for strangers, and relieuest the fatherles and widowes Psa. 146, 
                        •
                     ., but destroiest the waies of the vngodlie.
               Thou art touched with a care of the afflicted, and despisest not the desires of the fatherles, nor the widow when she poureth out hir praiers before thee Sira. 35, 14 15.. For the teares running downe the cheekes of the widow ascend vp into the heauens: and hir crie against him, which wringes it out.
               Grant therefore, merciful God, that in the sight of al gouernors, and iudges they may find fauor, and haue equal iudges and patrones of



their matters: that the iudgement of the stranger and fatherles be not peruerted, nor the cause of the widow neglected Deut. 24, verse. 19. Deut. 14, 29. Esaie. 1, 17. Psal. 82, 3.: but that iudgement may be sought according to thy lawe; the oppressed holpen; iudgement giuen for the orphane; and the widowe defended.
               For thou hast giuen a straight commandement vnto al iudges, saieng Ier. 22, 3., Keepe equitie and righteousnes, deliuer the oppressed from the power of the oppressor, doe not grieue, nor oppresse the stranger, the fatherles, nor the widowe, and shed none innocent blood.
               For thou art the God which wil auenge thine elect Luk. 18, 7., that crie vnto thee; thou keepest truth for euer and euer Psa. 146, 6. 9., doing iustice to the oppressed with wrong Ps. 109, 6..
               Now deliuer, O Lord, the fatherles, and widowes out of the pawes of rauening theeues, which eate vp the houses of widowes Mat. 23, 14 Mark. 12, 40 vnder the pretence of godlines, and colour of right.
               Deliuer them out of the hands of wicked iudges Esai. 10, 1. 2., which faine and inuent lawes to suppresse the poore,



and to hurt the cause of the base among the people, that widowesEsaie. 10, 3. may be a praie for them; and that they may
                     •
                  rob the fatherles: such peruerse iudges, O God, in the daie of their visitation and calamitie from a far thou wilt vtterlie destroy.
               Appoint vnto orphanes and widowes faithful patrones which wil be touched with an earnest care of their welfare.
               Also giue vs willing mindes to pleasure widowes and fatherles children, according to our habilitie, to deliuer the poore when he crieth Iob. 29, 12., and the fatherles, which hath none to helpe; to helpe him that is readie to fal, to comfort the13. widowes hurt; euermore to be as fathers to the fatherles, and from our tender yeares to minister instruction to the widowe, and suffer them neuer to perish, but in blessing to blesse them, and to fil them with bread Ps. 132, 15.
               For pure religion Iam. 1, 27., and vndefiled before thee, O God our Father, is to visit the fatherles, &amp; widowes in their aduersitie, and to keepe our selues vnspotted of the world.
               
                  For he which is merciful towards the orphane, as a father, &amp; sheweth himselfe as an husband towards his mother in taking the defence of their cause vpon him, he shal be as an obedient sonne of the Hiest, and thou God wilt more fauor him, than a mother can pittie hir sonne.
               But they which despise the sight and teares of the widowe Iob. 31, 16., &amp; keepe back their loafe, that the fatherles17. eate not thereof, and suffer them to perish for want of clothing and apparel,19. yea, which lift vp their hands to afflict them, shal greuouslie be22. punished, their shoulders shal fal from their ioints, and their armes be broken from the bones of them.
               O merciful God, extende thy fauor vpon al widowes, that at al times and in al afflictions they may trust in thee 1. Tim. 5, 5. the liuing God, and continue in supplications &amp; praiers night and daie, being diligent in al6. good works, not occupied in pleasures, neither wanton, idle, wandering from house to house, no tatlers, nor busiebodies, no speakers of things vncomelie, nor giuers of occasion whereby thy worde may be



blasphemed.
               Keepe al parents, that, they being taken awaie either by war, or vntimelie death, their wiues be not widowes, &amp; their sonnes orphanes, running here and there a begging, be thou their helper Exo. 22, 21. euen for Christ his sake our Lord, and Sauior,
               Amen.

                  O Most merciful God, greatlie haue we sinned, and, alas, are guiltie of manifolde crimes.
               For this cause diuerslie is our conscience clogged: so that we are wonderfullie agast beholding such bloodie wounds of our soules.
               And albeit thy Gospel dailie doth offer vnto vs in good sooth forgiuenes of our sinnes, through thy meere grace: yet our faith is maruelouslie weake by reason of the infirmitie of our flesh, and dailie batterings of Satan, which by craft endeuoureth to plucke vs from al



hope, and consolation.
               Therefore vnto thee doe we crie, O most holie Father, and eternal God, keepe vs in thy Name, that in tentations and extremities▪we neuer faint in courage.
               Moderate and mitigate our vexations, let them come to a ioieful ende, that we fal not into the most heinous sinne of incredulitie, and despaire.
               Comfort vs, that in the middes of death, we may trust in thee, the God of our life, and righteousnes.
               Let vs neuer despaire of thy mercie, &amp; grace, nor thinke with Cain Gen. 4, 13. that blasphemous &amp; cursed wretch, that our sinnes are mo than may be forgiuen.
               O staie vs Lord Psal. 119, verse. 117.; according to thy word; and we shal be safe. Let vs alwaies beleue, that where sinne aboundeth Rom. 5, 20 grace doth more abounde: and as sinne hath raigned vnto death, so that grace doth21. raigne through righteousnes vnto eternal life by Iesus Christ our Lord.
               O Christ, Sauior of the world, and most gratious God, whose mercie



commeth vpon vs like a streame, &amp; art the eternal Orator, which both outwardlie talkest to mankinde by thy Gospel, and inwardlie in our harts inflamest thy light which is true confession, faith, and comfort in thee: we beseech thee from the bottome of our harts, encre

                  WE wil cōfesse thee, O Lord &amp; King Sirac▪ 51, 1., and praise thee, O God our Sauior: we giue thankes vnto thy Name.
               For thou art our defender, and2. helper, and hast preserued our bodies from destruction, and from the snares of the slanderous tongues, and from the lips that are occupied with lies.
               Thou hast bin our helper from3. such as stoode vp against vs, and deliuered vs after the multitude of thy mercies; and for thine holie Name sake from the roaring of thē which were readie to deuour vs; out of the hands of such as sought after our liues; and from the manifold5. afflictions which we had; from



the deepe of hel; from an vncleane tong; from lieng words; from false accusations, and from vnrighteous sentence.
               Our soules shal praise the LordeSirach. 51, 6. vnto the death. For our liues drew nigh vnto hel downeward. Euils enuironed vs on euerie side, and7. there was no man to helpe vs. We looked about if there were any man to succour vs, but there was none.
               Then thought we vpon thy mercie,8. O Lorde, and vpon thine actes that thou euer hast done of old. For thou deliuerest al which put their trust in thee, and riddest them out of the handes of their enimies.
               Then wee lifted vp our praiers9. from the earth, and praied for deliuerance from death. We called vpon10. the Lord, the father of our Lord, that he would not leaue vs without helpe in the daie of our truble, and in the time of the proude.
               We wil praise thy Name continuallie,11. yeelding honor and thanks vnto the same. For our praiers were12. heard, and thou hast saued vs from destruction, and from al euil.
               Therefore we wil acknowledge,



and praise thee; we wil magnifie thy Name, for keeping vs from our youth vntil this present weeke, and for protecting vs alwaies of thy gratious mercie.
               Righteous, and merciful God, before thee doe we sigh, beseeching thee by the death and burial of our Lord and Sauior Christ thy welbeloued Sonne, that thou wouldest vouchsafe to couer, and burie al our misdeedes, whatsoeuer from our infancy vntil this present houre either wittinglie, or ignorantlie we haue committed, and especiallie those which this weeke we haue done in thought, word, or deede, against thy diuine maiestie and commandements, al which to thee alone which knowest al things we confesse with broken harts, and lowlie spirits, beseeching thee to pardon them, and to forgiue al our sinnes, whereof thou knowest we are guiltie; and to deliuer vs from al euils both present and to come.
               O Lord, heare the voice of our praier, encline thine eare vnto vs in the daies of our necessitie, when we shal crie vnto thee Psal. 116, 1..
               
                  The snares of death haue compassedPsal. 116, 3. vs about, and the straightes of hel haue taken holde of vs; we haue lighten vpon sorowe, and troble. Notwithstanding we wil cal vpon4. the Lord, O Lord, deliuer our soules.
               Gratious is the Lord, and righteous,5. yea, our God is merciful.
               The Lord preserueth the simple;6. we were in troble, and he helped vs.
               Turne then againe vnto your rest,7. O our soules; For the Lorde wil blesse ye.
               Thou wilt deliuer our soules8. from death, our eies from teares, and our feete from falling, that we9. may walke before thee in the lande of the liuing.
               O Christ, God, and Sauior of the worlde: saue vs, Lord, watching; keepe vs sleeping; that in peace we may both rest and wake.
               Be thou our light in darknes, then shal our life be as cleere as the noone daie Iob. 11, 17., and shine forth as the morning; so that with confidence, and securitie we may lie downe, and18. sleepe, &amp; none shal make vs afraid, because thou art our protector.
               
                  O Sonne of righteousnes, and brightnes of perpetual charitie, lead vs into the vision of thy light, where thou shalt euerlastinglie shine vpon vs, and thou God be our glorie. The Sunne there shal not go downe, neither the Moone be hid: but thou, Lorde, shalt be our euerlasting light Esaie. 60, verse. 19., that our sorowful daies may take an ende.
               Grant likewise that leauing this place of darkenes we may be translated into the true, and new light, which we now looke for through faith, vntil the perpetual morning appeere vnto vs, that we may beholde thee in a cleere light face to face Reu. 22, 4., where shal be no night, and we shal neede no candle, neither light of the Sunne, but thou Lorde5. wilt lighten vs.
               O holie Spirit, God, be thou a light vnto vs. At our last gaspe, when our harts pant Psa. 38, 10., our strength faileth; our sight departeth; our hearing is deafe; our mouth dōme; when our feete cannot go, nor our hands feele; when al our senses forsake vs, giue vs some sense of eternal life, that we may taste in



this world the beginnings of thine euerlasting ioie: and at our departure out of this world behold by faith thy diuine presence, and so sleepe quietlie to eternal life,
            
            Amen.

                  O Eternal God, which of thy great mercie hast vouchsafed to cal me, a miserable and most vnworthie man, to the ministerie of thy Gospel, and



hast appointed me to be a feeder of soules Eph. 4, 11., and a fisher of men Luk. 5, 10. and now at the length segregated me, according to thy good pleasure, to preach the word of saluation vnto this flock, and people committed to my charge:
               With lowlines of spirit, &amp; sighes vnfained I beseech thee, O Christ, which art our chiefe shepheard 1 Pet 5, 4., and Archbishop, make me an able minister of the newe Testament 2. Cor. 3, 6; a chosen vessel Acts. 9, 15., and profitable instrument for the carrieng of thy message before the nations, and Princes of this world, as it becommeth the minister of Christ 1. Cor. 4, 1., and faithful dispenser of the mysteries of God, and neuer let me proue an idol, or idle shepherd.
               Worke thou effectuallie through me, and grant good successe vnto my doings, that fruitefullie I may vtter to mine auditors the healthful 1. Cor. 15, verse. 2., and heauenlie foode of their soules, which is the syncere preaching of thy gratious worde, without al corruption, or deprauing of the same.
               Take not fro my lips the word of



truth Psal. 119, verse. 43., and let me not speake either the imaginations of my foolish braine, or the vaine perswasions of my owne hart Ier. 13, 10., but may vtter thine heauenlie worde, and minister according to the virtue which thou dost grant 1. Pe. 4, 11., that in al things thy glorie may be sought of me:
               That I follow not after couetousnes feeding my selfe Ezec. 34, 2. 1. Pet. 5, 2., and forsaking my flock; but giue me such an earnest care of their wel doing, that without constraint cheerefullie 1. Cor. 9, verse. 16. 17., and gladlie, being bounde therevnto, I may discharge mine office:
               That I be not desirous of filthie lucre 1. Pet. 5, 2., but with a willing minde may profit the Church; neither as an exerciser of auctoritie ouer my3. flock, but that, euen through an hartie zeale of thine holie Name, I may feede, and make fat, in the plentiful, and godlie pastures Ezec. 34, verse. 14. of thy pure worde, thy sheepe committed to my trust:
               That I may retaine a diligent consideration of the weaker sort Ezec. 34, verse. 16., and helpe the feeble, heale the sick, strengthen the bruzed; that I may bring home that which is seduced,



and seeke that is lost, and carefullie prouide for that which is strong; that I labor not in mine office negligentlie Ier. 48, 10., nor accomplish the worke of thee my maister with deceipt.
               O almightie God, whose dwelling is aboue the cloudes, which hast appointed me a keeper, and watchman for thy people Ezech. 33, verse. 2, &amp;c., to forewarne the simple that they be not, through the subtiltie of vaine teachers, deceiued, seduced, and made a praie Ezec. 34, 5., and spoile for the beasts of the field; make me so watchful, and careful ouer thy flock, that couragiouslie I may withstand, and beate awaie those rauening wolues Mat. 7, 15. which teare and scatter thy flock, and, by reprouing and refuting their heresies, ouercome false prophets.
               Giue me that vtterance and wisedome Mark. 10, verse. 19., which none may resist, or gainesaie Luk. 21, 15.
               Grant me a learned Esai. 50, 4., and eloquent vtterance to diuide thy word rightlie; and wisedome distinctlie, and in right order to propose the same, and to be able and readie to admonish 2. Tim. 3, verse. 16., and to comfort the



weake, and, if anie offende through weakenes Galat. 6, 1▪
                   to wyn him vnto weldoing by the spirit of meekenes, and modestlie to rebuke such as may be recouered, but those, which openlie doe sinne without blushing, to take vp before the congregation 1. Timo. 5, verse. 20., not regarding the person, that the rest, by their example, may feare, and forsake their wickednes.
               O Sonne of God, our continual Intercessor, which hast ordeined me to be a voice crieng Esai. 40, 3. 9., endue mee with the grace of thine holie Spirit, that I may exalt my voice like a trumpet Esai. 58, 1., and declare their wickednes vnto thy people, and neuer shewe my selfe as a domme dog Esai. 56, 10, which cannot bark: so shal I not be partaker of their sinnes, nor guiltie of their condemnation, neither wilt thou require their blood at mine hands Ezec. 3, 18. Ezech. 33, 8.: Wherefore againe, and againe I beseech thee, assist me euermore that through an open and bold reprehending of their wickednes, I may deliuer my soule in the daie of wrath, and teach thy waies vnto the wicked Psa. 51, 13., whereby the vngodlie may repent.
               
                  Finallie, so blesse me with thy fauor, that I may walke in thy feare, as it becommeth me, and be an ensample of good life vnto my flock 1. Pet. 5, 3., least, while I preach vnto others 1. Cor. 9, 17 my selfe proue a castawaie; that in no case through my wicked conuersation Rom. 2, 24, I giue occasion to anie man of blaspheming thy worde; and that in trobles, and persecutions I faint not, but may suffer patientlie the reproch of this world, and the manifold trobles that Satan stirreth vp to disquiet thy Church.
               Grant also to as manie as shal heare thy worde from my mouth, that they may firmelie with me beleeue the same, and be the followers of me 1. Cor. 4, 16 2. Thes. 3, 9., as I followe thee 1. Cor. 11, 1, and haue consideration of such as walke so, as becommeth Christians, that together we may continue in faith, and patience, euen for thine owne sake,
               Amen.
            
            
               
               
                  A praier for anie hearer of Gods worde.
               
                  I Giue thee most hartie thanks, O eternal God, Father of our Lord Iesu Christ, for that it hath pleased thee of thine vnspeakable mercie, and goodnes in al ages continuallie to sende into the worlde men wonderful in thy gifts and knowledge of thy wil to be renuers, and spreaders forth of thy truth Matth. 23, verse. 34.;
               Like thankes I ascribe vnto thy sacred Maiestie for allowing vs shepherds Ephe. 4, 11, and preachers in these our daies for the gathering together of thy Church out of al mankinde11. to the building of the bodie of Christ.
               Humblie I beseech thee, gratious GOD, continue alwaie among vs thy pure worde through thy ministers; gather vnto thy selfe an euerlasting Congregation, &amp; so instruct mine hart with thy Spirit of truth, that vnfainedlie I may assent to thy wholesome worde, proue a liuelie



member of thy bodie, and be incorporated into that societie which both in this world doth syncerelie confesse thee, and euermore extol thine holie Name.
               Keepe those Preachers which thou dost, and wilt giue in the certaine knowledge of thy blessed wil, that they may from time to time both open vnto vs thine intent concerning the repairing of mankinde, the saluation, and redemption of our soules through thy free mercie; and also teach vs how to liue in new obedience, and to abstaine from carnal desires 1. Pet. 2, 11. which fight against the soule.
               Inspire thy ministers, and preachers of thy word with thine holie Spirit, that they may vtter thy wil purelie as they haue receiued it from thine hands, retaining the forme of wholesome words 2. Timo. 1, verse. 13., and sounding onlie that doctrine which is vttered by thy Sonne out of thy bosome Iohn. 1, 18.. For otherwise, departing from the order of faith, and the rule of thy worde, they wil greatlie obscure the light of thy doctrine; and obtrude vpon vs the vanitie of their



owne inuentions. Wherefore let them speake thy word not deceiptfullie 2. Cor. 4, 2., but syncerelie, euen as from thee, and in thy sight.
               Grant also, that, by transforming thy ministerie into policie, they Lord not ouer thine elect 1. Pet. 5, 3., neither contend about superioritie and primacie in thy Church; but onelie to seeke the glorie of thy Name, and the saluation both of themselues, and vs.
               Giue them libertie of speech boldlie without feare to blame and rebuke al false doctrine, blasphemous superstition, and abuses in thy Church.
               Open vnto them the doore of vtterance Colos. 4, 3. that they may speake the mysteries of Christ, and manifest them as they ought to doe, so shal their doings be profitable vnto the godlie.
               Assist them also with thine especial grace, that they disgrace not their doctrine by impuritie of life, but let their conuersation answere vnto the doctrine which they teach and preach.
               Especiallie for the shepherd of



my soule, frō whose mouth I learne thy blessed wil, I hartilie praie, that thou wilt keepe him in religion, syncere; and pure from enormous offences in outward conuersation: endue him with a long and healthful life, if it be thy good pleasure, that manie a good daie, and yeere he may continue in preaching the gladsome voice of thy gratious Gospel among vs without contention and strife.
               And, O Sonne of God, which art the Lord of al the flock, worke thou effectuallie by thy preachers, speake thou within vs to our harts the blessed wil of thine eternal Father, and confirme thy doctrine in our minds by thine holie Spirit.
               Grant that we may truelie know, and discerne the same from the houling of wolues, and from the inchanted songs of seducing hirelings Ioh. 10, 12.; and grant that we may know thee Ioh. 17, 25 euen as thou knowest thine heauenlie Father, and to walke religiouslie, and righteouslie in thy sight, shewing our selues to be of that holie seede which praiseth thy Name for euermore.
               
                  Come holie Spirit, open mine hart and eares that I may conceaue the profite of thy wholesome doctrine, and the sweete comfort reuealed in thine holie word, by the preaching of the Gospel.
               O Lorde, I acknowledge with teares my sluggishnes, &amp; carelesnes in seeking thy truth, and bewaile the wretched coldnes, and hardnes of mine hart, beseeching thee to endue me with an vnfained longing, and an ardent desire of holie Sermons.
               Grant that in this life I may worship the feete of the preachers of peace, and reuerence the true dispensors of thy mysteries, thy faithful ministers with doble honor 1. Tim. 5, 17▪
                  ; and none otherwise to obeie their godlie sermons, than I woulde if a voice should sounde from the heauens.
               Let me not for the blemishes and imperfections of some particular men, vnreuerentlie conceaue of thine whole ministerie.
               Worke also within me, that, despising thy word Luke. 10, verse. 16. 1. Thes. 4, 8. deliuered vnto vs, I neuer seeke after strange reuelations,



or violent rauishings both besides, and contrarie to thy worde, but, bearing alwaies in minde the order which thou hast appointed, may constantlie embrace thy word manifested in the Church.
               Finallie impart such grace vpon vs, that we may imitate, and folowe the good workes of holie men, casting of the old man by putting on the new which is created after God in righteousnes, and true holines,
               Amen.
            
            
               
                  A praier for a Prince, or Magistrate.
               
                  BLessed art thou, Lord God of Sabbaoth. For to thee appertaineth al magnificence, and power, and glorie; to thee belongeth al honor, and auctoritie.
               For whatsoeuer is either in the heauens aboue, or in the earth beneath it is thine. Thine, O Lord, is the kingdome; thou art aboue al Princes &amp; Kings. Riches are thine, glorie is thine, and thou art Lorde



ouer al. In thee remaineth virtue, and power, greatnes, and gouernement.
               O God of my Fathers Wisd. 9, 1., &amp; Lord of mercie which hast made al things by thy word, and by thy wisedome2. appointed man to rule the creatures which thou hast made, and to3. gouerne the world with equitie and iustice, I praise thee, and extol thy glorious Name for appointing me thy seruant 1. Kin. 3, 7. to rule and gouerne this thy people committed vnto my charge.
               Now therefore, gratious Lord, fauor ablic beholde me, that I may treade the path of truth, righteousnes, and synceritie of hart in thy sight.
               Let me not abuse mine auctoritie Ester. 13, 2 but gouerne with lenitie &amp; gentlenes the people vnder me, that liuing a godlie and honest life mankind may enioy their desired peace.
               Giue therefore vnto thy seruant an hart desirous of instructions, that I may iudge the people, &amp; descerne betweene good and euil 1. Kin. 3, 9., and, neither declining to the right hand or to the left, stoutlie, and valiantlie



maintaine the cause of the righteous.
               Grant me counsel, and assistance to doe such things as are grateful vnto thee, good for thy Church, and profitable for my people, and Commonweale.
               Giue me thy wisedome Wisd. 9, 4. 2. Chr. 1, 10., and reiect me not from thy children. For Wisd. 9, 5. Psal. 116, 16. I thy seruant, and sonne of thine handmaide, am a fraile man, of a short time, and ful weake in the vnderstanding of iudgement, and the lawes.
               Thou hast chosen me Wis. 9, 7. 1. Chr. 28, 5. 2. Chr. 1, 9. a gouernor of thy people, and a iudge of thy sonnes, and daughters: sende me therefore wisedome Wis. 9, 10. from thy sacred heauens, and from the seate of thy magnificence, that it may be with me, and labor with me, whereby I may perceiue what is acceptable in thine eies, and learne that I haue no power of my selfe, but from thee Rom. 13, 1. Wisdo. 6, 3., which art almightie, &amp; raignest ouer the kingdomes of men, giuing them at thy pleasure Dan. 4, 17..
               Grant that I neuer conceaue Sira. 10, 15. proudlie of my selfe, but may receiue in patience the discipline of



thy Lawe.
               Make mee wise and circumspect, that I neither offer▪ iniurie to anie man, neither suffer anie to be iniuried; that so equitie may be maintained, and iustice among men preserued.
               Let me at no time vnder the shewe, and color of equitie vphold, or countenance a wicked cause: neither yet without sufficient examination and trial of both parties, giue sentence against anie.
               Allowe me such counselers, gouernors, and ouerseers as are of courage Exod. 18, verse. 21., fearing God, dealing vprightlie, hating couetousnes, that by them the burden, charge, and care which I sustaine, may be somewhat lightened.
               Endue both me, and them with thine holie Spirit, that with earnest studie, and watchful minds we may discerne betwene matters Deu. 1, 13., that no man through our negligence haue the ouerthrow in a righteous cause, but that sentence be rightlie pronounced betweene a man, and his brother, and a stranger without respect of anie person Deut. 1, 17. Leuit. 19, 15. Prou. 24, 23. Iames. 2, 9. in iudgement.
               
                  Let vs heare aswel the litle as the great, and feare no man. Because the iudgement is thine, which standest in the companie of iudges, and among the Gods Psa. 82, 1. thou plaiest the iudge. For the iudgement is not of man 2. Chr. 19, verse. 6. but of the Lord: and, whatsoeuer we shal iudge it wil come vpon vs.
               Wherefore, let thy feare be with vs Sirach. 10, verse. 22. that we may doe al things with care and circumspection, that we proue not children Esaie. 3, 4. in vnderstanding, neither giue our selues to dronkennes and bellicheere, Ecc. 10, 17 but to eate our meate in due season and that for strength, not for dronkennes.
               For thou wilt make earnest, and diligent enquirie of al our workes Wisd. 6, 3., and search al our cogitations: because we are thy seruants, and deputies to gouerne; men of a very short life; and he which is to daie a King Sira. 10, 11. to morow may be dead. For we be al mortal Psal. 82, 7., and subiect to one, and the same corruption.
               Besides, an horrible iudgement is nigh for such as walke not after the wil of thee Wisd. 6, 4▪ 6., our God. For he that is



most low, shal finde mercie, but the mightie shal be mightilie tormented.Wisd. 6, 7. For thou, which art the Lord ouer al, regardest not the person of anie Deu. 10, 17 2. Chr. 19, 7. Acts. 10, 34. Rom. 2, 11. Galat. 2, 6. 1. Pet. 1, 17., neither doest thou feare the greatnes of the mightie. Because aswel the great as the smal are the workemanship of thine handes; thy care is equal ouer al; and giuest to godlie Princes eternal happines, which art the Iudge both of the quicke and dead, liuing and raigning with thy Sonne in the vnitie of the Spirit, a God for euermore,
               Amen.

                  O Almightie God, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, in thine hande is al power both in heauen and earth Sira. 10, 4. 15., thou confirmest kingdomes, and againe doest alter them according to thine heauenlie pleasure, &amp;c.
               This praier you shal finde afore, pag. 7.
            
            
               
               
                  A praier for a married man.
               
                  O GOD almightie, auctor, and institutor of matrimonie, which in the copling together of male and female dost offer vnto vs a consideration of the sacred, and great mysterie of the marriage of our Lord and Sauior Christ, with his spouse the Church Eph. 5, 23. 1. Cor. 11, 3., and with al expresse the most burning affection of thy sonne towards his beloued Spouse.
               For he offered himselfe vpon the altar of the crosse Eph. 5, 25. to sanctifie, and clense hir by the washing of water through the word, and to make hir26. glorious for himselfe, without spot,27. or wrincle, or any such thing.
               For euen as the husband by an inseparable bande of good wil is bound to the wife, so that both prosperitie and aduersitie is common to them both: so is Christ copled to his Church through suffering vpon his owne flesh the punishmēt which was due vnto hir, and by making vs



with him felowe heires of eternal ioie, by couering our offences.
               So that now there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Iesu Rom 8, 1. which walke not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. Whereby we gather that man should loue his wife Eph. 5, 28. euen as his owne bodie. For no man euer yet hated his owne29. flesh howsoeuer crooked, old, weak, leane, or deformed it be: but so much the more carefullie doth hide &amp; couer those faults by how much they appeere the more deformed. Yea he doth nourish, and cherish that weake part, euen as Christ doth loue his Church though foule, and deformed with sinne, which casteth not hir of, though she seeme il fauored, but healeth hir griefes, dissembleth much, forgiueth, and wypeth awaie hir offences.
               I beseech thee, O Father, which art neither made nor begotten, marrie mee Hos. 2, 19. for euer vnto thy Sonne; marrie me vnto him in righteousnes, &amp; iudgement, in godlines, and mercie; marrie me vnto him in faith, that I may truelie knowe thee my Lorde and God, which wilt not



the death of a sinner Eze. 33, 11., but rather that he repent and liue.
               O thou onlie begotten Sonne of God, ioine me I beseech thee vnto thy bodie, that ingraffed in thee, I may drawe from thee the iuice of life, and of heauenlie wisedome.
               Defende mee, and thine whole Church against the rage of Satan, the world, and the flesh.
               Loue, cherish, and comfort such as are ingraffed to thy flesh. Purge and wash me fro my sinnes, filthines, and spots through thy great mercie and merits.
               Deck me with thy gifts &amp; goodnes. Wash me with water Eze. 36, 25, &amp; purge me with thy blood. Annoint me with thine oile of gladnes Psal. 45, 8. put vpon me thy roabes of righteousnes, and couer me with thy glorious purple; adorne me with the pretious stones of virtue, and place vpon mine head glorie and honor, that al mine ornament may be inward, and that I may please thee through hoping in thy mercie. For thou art mine husbande which louest me; my God whom I worship; and the head wherevnto I am subiect.
               
                  Giue me grace that I neuer delight in mine owne fairenes, and so plaie the harlot Hose. 2, 5., following mine old louers, which promise me bread and water, wol, flaxe, oile, &amp; drinke.
               O God the holie Ghost, which maintainest the loue of married folkes within our brests, I humblie beseech thee, inflame the heate of chaste affection betweene al married folkes.
               Giue me wisedome discretelie to dwel with my wife 1. Pet. 3, 7., considering alwaies that naturallie she is weake: and for that cause I must beare with much foolishnes, and swalowe vp manie sorrowes when I shal perceiue the weaknes of hir affections.
               And for asmuch as I am the head of my wife Eph. 5, 23. 1. Cor. 11, 3., giue mee grace with iudgement godlie both to instruct hir, and to bring vp my familie in the knowledge and feare of thy Name.
               Let me neither ouer nicelie bring them vp, nor to roughlie entreate them, but gently vse them, that they may both continue in thy feare, and yeeld me due obedience, but especiallie liue godlie in thine eies.
               
                  Blesse thou my wife that she may proue a sweet companion vnto me, louing mee vnfainedlie from the hart without dissimulation; so that I may safelie trust in hir Prou. 31, vers. 11, &amp;c., and she may render vnto mee good for good, not euil for good.
               O God, which art a chaste minde, make me with a chaste bodie and pure affectiō to serue thee in chaste matrimonie, and neuer with a wicked eie to beholde the wife of another man to lust after hir Mat. 5, 28. neither yet to forsake my proper bed Sirach. 23, vers. 16, &amp;c. with the losse of my soule.
               Driue awaie Satan the mortal enimie to this thine ordinance, that he sowe not contentions, &amp; braules betweene vs.
               Cut of al occasions of debate, and sinister suspicions, that so in a true conioining together of minds we may in this world liue virtuouslie, and hereafter in the worlde to come raigne eternallie according to thy worde, Amen.

                  OEternal, and euerliuing God, Father of our Lord Iesu Christ, maker of heauen and earth, which hast inioined vnto vs children that with due obedience we honor our parents Exo. 20, 12 Deut. 5, 16. Matth. 15, 4.: which thing not onelie true religion doth exact, but also natural reason doth binde vs vnto.
               Besides, thou art maruelouslie delighted with such obedience of children towarde their parents for thy Sonnes sake our Lorde.
               And that the more willinglie we may obeie them, thou hast made a singular promise of long life Ephes. 6, verse. 1, &amp;c. Sirach. 3, 7. vnto vs.
               And as the obedience of children which they owe, and shewe to their parents is exceedinglie grateful in thy sight: so contrariwise obstinacie and disobedience is most vnsauerie, and displeaseth thee. The which may be gathered by the horriblenes of punishment Deut. 21, vers. 18, &amp;c. which thou denouncest against stubborne, and



disobedient children.
               I beseech thee therefore most humblie euen for thy Sonnes sake, in whom onelie thou delightest Mat. 3, 17. Luke. 3, 22., lighten the eies of mine vnderstanding, that aboue al I may truelie and syncerelie acknowledge thee my principal Father Eph. 3, 14. 15., of whom al the familie both in heauen, and earth is named; and, in true inuocation, and thankesgiuing, obeie; and, in true holines, and righteousnes serue thee my God, and heauenlie Father, from whom I drewe vital breath Act. 17, 25., my soule, and bodie, with al the faculties, and powers that I haue.
               For which cause I am bound rather to obeie thee my maker Act. 5, 29. than men; and to be occupied in those things which belong to thee my Father which art in heauen Luk. 2, 49., and cheerefullie to go about that which thou hast enioined me.
               Secondlie giue me grace to honor mine earthlie parents in deede, and word Sirac. 3, 9., in al patience, and neuer to be a cause of their sorow, and griefe of minde.
               And when their vnderstanding



shal faile through age Sirac 3, 14., be it far fro me that I doe either disdaine or deride them, albeit I am beautified15. with neuer so excellent gifts of nature, but make me to beare with the16. weaknes of their age, as I am bound both by thy word and in conscience to doe, so shal I be blessed. For Sirac. 3, 6. he which honoreth his parents shal haue ioie of his owne children, and when he maketh his praier he shal be heard.
               O Lord, forgiue thou my sinnes whereby I haue offended my louing parents.
               O remember not the sinnes of my youth Psal. 25, 6., nor my rebellions: but according to thy mercie remember thou me, euen for thy goodnes sake, O Lord.
               Let the example of thy Sonne my Sauior Christ, which in his childhoode was obedient vnto his parents Luk. 2, 51., be depainted, and fixed alwaies in my minde, the better to obeie them which begat, and haue brought me vp, and to relieue them being weake either through age or sicknes.
               For he which forsaketh his father



                  Sira. 3, 17. shal come to shame: and he that angreth his mother is cursed of God.
               Likewise let it please thee to giue me a willing hart to obeie my teachers, and betters, and to omit no part of dutie, and reuerence which I owe: so that I may alwaies declare my selfe to be a decliner from euil Psa. 34, 14, and a doer of good, a seeker of peace, and a follower of the same.
               O Christ Iesu, which hast giuen to weake yeeres the benefit of docilitie, giue likewise to the towardnes of my nature the aide of thy grace, that I may learne good nurture, and liberal artes seruing to the aduancement of thy glory, wherby the more easilie I may attaine to the knowledge of thee, whom to know is perfect happines, and felicitie Iohn. 17, 3..
               For thou art the fountaine from whence al wisedome &amp; vnderstanding proceedeth Sirach. 1, 1. Prouer. 2, 6., without whom al our studies lacke good successe. Wherefore at thy hands doe I beg wisedome Iames. 1, 5., which giuest liberallie without reproching any man.
               Lighten thou mine vnderstanding



with thy grace, that, hauing learned the liberal artes, and the tongues, I may applie them to those endes wherevnto they serue, that, according to thy sacred infancie, I may profite as in yeeres, so in wisedome and virtue both afore thee, and man Luk. 2, 52.
               O God the holie Ghost, purifie mine hart by a liuelie faith, that I spend not my time in vaine pleasure cockering mine affections.
               Extinguish in me the flames of doting, and filthie loue, and let me neuer serue the lust of the flesh like horse and mule Psa. 32, 9. which haue none vnderstanding.
               Thine hands, O Lord, haue made, and fashioned me Ps. 119, 73: O giue me vnderstanding, that I may learne thy Lawe.

                  O Omnipotent, &amp; eternal God, Father of our Lord Iesu Christ, maker, and preseruer both of heauen and earth, together with thy coeternal Sonne, and the holie Ghost:
               We haue sinned Psa. 106, 6., O Lord, with our fathers, we haue committed iniquitie, and done wickedlie.
               Therefore we openlie confesse that by thy righteous iudgement we are iustlie punished; and rightlie deserue that barbarous, and vngodlie nations, shoulde spoile vs of our goods, ouerthrowe our schooles, Churches, and Commonweales; make vnmerciful hauocke of the promiscuous multitude, and carie miserable men from the sweete bosomes of thy deere friendes into a slauerie more greeuous than death.
               O God, it is thou which repellest vs, yea thou dost confounde vs before the nations for our sinnes Psal. 44, 9.,



and goest not forth with our armies to the battel.
               Thou makest vs to turne ourPsal 44, 10. backs vpō our enimies, so that they which hate vs spoile our goods.
               Thou sufferest vs to be eaten vp11. like sheepe, and hast scattered vs among the Heathen.
               Thou sellest thy people for12. naught, and takest no monie for them.
               Therefore be the Heathen come into thine inheritance Psal. 79, 1., thy holie Temple haue they defiled; they haue destroied our townes, and houses, and brought them into an heape of stones.
               The dead bodies of thy seruants2. haue they giuen to be meate for foules of the aire, and the flesh of thy Saints vnto the beastes of the lande.
               Their blood haue they shed like3. waters on euerie side, and there was no man to burie them.
               We are become an open shame4. to our enimies: a verie scorne and byword vnto them that are rounde about vs.
               Wherefore in these mischieuous



wars, and in the middes of our fatal punishments, we flie vnto thee, saieng Psal. 79, 9., Helpe vs, O God of our saluation, for the glorie of thy Name; O deliuer vs, and be merciful vnto our sinnes for thy Name sake.
               O deale not with vs after our sinnes Ps. 103, 10., neither reward vs after our iniquities.
               Remember not our former sins Psal. 79, 8., but let thy tender mercie preuent vs. For we are in great miserie.
               Looke vpon our affliction and trauel Psa. 25, 18., and forgiue al our sinnes.
               Behold our enimies for they are19. manie, and they hate vs with cruel hatred.
               Thou which hast forgiuen the iniquitie of thy people Psal. 85, 2., and couered al their sinnes; and hast withdrawen al thine anger, and turned3. back frō the fiercenes of thy wrath: turne vs, we humblie beseech thee,4. O God our Sauior, &amp; remoue awaie thy displeasure, that in true repentance we may please thee for thy Sonne his sake. Wilt thou be displeased5. with vs for euer? or wilt thou prolong thy wrath from one generation to another?
               
                  O let the sorowful sighing Psal. 79, 11. of thy prisoners come before thee: according to the greatnes of thy power preserue those which are appointed to die.
               Poure out thine indignation vpon the heathen Ier 10, 25. Psal. 79, 6. that knowe thee not, and vpon the kingdomes which cal not vpon thy Name: that al nations10. may knowe the vengeance of the blood of thy seruantes that is shed.
               Consider the mortal threatnings of our enimies, that they may be hindered from exercising their tyrannie vpon vs, saieng triumphinglie,

               We haue sinned, O Lord, Dan. 9, 5.

               We haue not obeied thy voice10. to walke in the lawes which thou hast laide before vs.

thou wilt heare the praiers, and grant the requests of any man among the people, praieng from the bottom of his hart, acknowledging his sinnes vnfainedlie, and lifting vp his hands vnto thee through Iesus Christ before the throne of grace Heb. 4, 16.;
               Be thou merciful 1. King. 8, verse. 39., giue vnto euerie man according to al his petitions. For thou alone knowest the harts of al the children of men.
               Heare thou our praiers and petitions, and deliuer vs from this contagious, and deadlie pestilence.
               Commande thine Angel which striketh vs, to put vp his sworde into the sheath 2. Sam. 24, verse. 16. 1. Chr. 21, 15, that he strike vs not to our final and vtter destruction; proceede not in thy wrath, spare vs frō death, and bring not our ende by the plague.
               Let the heauens be milde, &amp; our dwelling places healthful, least the aire being infected Psa. 78, 50, poure downe the contagion thereof vpon vs to our destruction.
               O Lord, turne awaie thine hand, it is sufficient 2. Sam. 24, verse. 16. 1. Chr. 21, 15, let now thine hand cease, that al the earth may know



                  Baru. 2, 15. how that thou Lord art our God, and that we doe cal vpon thy name.
               O Lord looke downe from thine16. holie house vpon vs, encline thine eare, and heare vs.
               Open thine eies and beholde the17. affliction and mortalitie of thy people. For the dead, whose spirits are16. taken awaie, giue vnto thee neither praise, nor righteousnes, but the17. 
                  
                     •
                  oule that is vexed for the multitude of hir sinnes, which goeth on heauilie and weakelie, whose eies18. begin to faile; yea the hungrie soule is it that ascribeth due praise and righteousnes vnto thee, O Lord.
               For we poure out our praiers before19. thee, and require mercie in thy sight, O Lord our God, not for anie worthines either of our owne, or of our fathers Matth. 3, 9.: but in the name of thy sonne Iesus Christ, in whom thou art wel pleased Mat. 3, 17. Matth. 17, 5., we beseech thee, be merciful vnto vs, and helpe vs in necessitie.
               Turne thee againe Psa. 90, 13., O Lord, at the last, and be merciful vnto thy seruants; that this poisoned infection may be taken from vs.
               Notwithstanding if it be thy pleasure



to visite our offences with the rod Ps. 89, 33., thy blessed wil be done Mat. 6, 10. Luke. 11, 2., and giue vs grace to beare thy fatherlie correction laide vpon vs pacientlie Prou. 3, 11. Hebr. 12, 6., remembring alwaies that we are chastened of thee our Lorde in this world, that we be not condemned with the reprobate 1. Cor. 11, verse. 32. in the world to come, Amen.
               A praier for the sicke you shal find afore, pag. 153.
            
            
               
                  A praier to auoide both raging tempests, and vnseasonable weather.
               
               
                  O Most wise and mightie God, thou art a glorious King in al the world, thy woonderful maiestie doth shine and is knowen also by raine, thundering, lightening, and other meteors ingendered in the aire: thy throne is among the cloudes, thou hast made darckenes thy secrete place Psal. 18, 11., and thy pauilion about thee euen darknes of water, and cloudes of the aire.
               At the brightnes of thy presence12.


                  
the cloudes doe passe awaie, so doe the hailestones, and fierie coles.
               Thou dost thunder from the heauens,Psal. 18, 13. and giuest thy voice, hailestones, and coales of fire.
               Thou sendest thy arrowes, and14. scatterest them; thou encreasest lightnings and destroiest them.
               Who is so great a God Psa. 77, 13, as thou, our God? Thou art the God which14. dost woonders, and declarest my power among the nations.
               Thou redeemest thy people with15. thine arme.
               The waters sawe thee, and were16. afraide; the depthes trembled.
               The cloudes poured out water,17. the aire thundred, &amp; thine arrowes went abroade.
               The voice of thy thunder was18. heard round about; the lightnings lightened the worlde, the earth trembled, and shooke.
               The foundations of the earth were discouered at thy rebuking Psa. 18, 15., O Lord, at the blasting of the breath of thy nostrels.
               Therfore shal the verie heauens extol thy wonderous workes Psal. 89, 5., and the Saints set forth thy truth in the



Congregation.
               For who is equal to thee in heauen?Psalm. 89, 6. and who like thee among the sonnes of the Gods?
               Thou art verie terrible in the assemblie7. of the saints, and to be reuerenced aboue al that are about thee.
               O Lord, God of hosts, who is like8. vnto thee? which art a mighty Lord, and thy truth is about thee.
               Thou rulest the raging of the sea;9. thou stillest the waues therof when they doe arise.
               Thou onelie art of power to resolue into vapors the drops of the sea by the heate of the sunne; thou takest the same vp being turned into airie substance, and againe turnest it into meere water, and makest it to come pouring downe vpon the face of the earth.
               Whatsoeuer thou wilt Psa. 135, 6. thou dost in heauen and in earth, and in the sea, and in al deepe places.
               With thy power thou madest the earth Ier. 51, 15.; with thy wisedome thou hast established the world, and with thy discretion stretched out the heauens.
               Assoone as thou lettest thy voice16.


                  
be heard the waters in the aire waxe fierce, thou drawest vp the cloudes from the ends of the earth; thou turnest the lightening into raine, and bringest foorth the winde out of thy treasures: thou couerest the heauens with clouds Psa. 147, 8., and preparest raine for the earth; thou makest the grasse to growe vpon the9. mountaines, and prouidest herbes for the vse of man; thou giuest to beasts their foode, and to the yong rauens that crie. Behold, so great art thou Iob. 36, 26., that thou passest our knowledge, neither can the nomber of thy yeres be searched out. When thou restrainest the drops of water,27. the raine poureth downe by the vapors thereof, and falleth abundantlie vpon man.
               Thou bringest forth the windes out of thy treasures Psa. 135, 7. Ier
                        •
                      51, 16., that is from the secret places where thou didst hide them in great abundance, that they might be readie at thy commandement, and come forth when thou thinkest good.
               Thou makest the cloudes to labor to giue water to the earth Iob. 37, 11., and scatterest the cloude of thy light.
               
                  Thou turnest it about by thy gouernment,Iob. 37, 
                        •
                     12. that they may doe whatsoeuer thou commandest them vpon the whole world.
               O God, mine hart is trobled very sore when I beholde the immoderate showers, and heare the terrible thunder, yea it forsaketh his place, when I heare the noise of thy voice, and the speech proceeding from thy mouth.
               O God, which rulest heauen and earth, I most humblie beseech thee, mercifullie to driue awaie, or at least to mittigate these mightie streames, and most raging tempests.
               Restraine the thunderbolts, and thy fierie darts that they hurt vs not. Keepe vs, and our nestes that we perish not through lightenings, nor be destroied by thy thunderclaps. Protect our houses &amp; vs that we be neither consumed by thy firie meteor, nor be drowned by any suddaine flood.
               O merciful God, raine not, I beseech thee, hailestones vpon the face of the earth, neither strike such as are in the fieldes be they man or



beast Exo. 9, 22..
               Strike not thou therewithal the25. herbes of the fielde, neither breake thou, gracious Lord, the trees of our lande.
               Destroie not our corne with hailestones: nor with hailestones smite thou our cattel Psa. 78, 48, and deliuer our flocks from the thunderbolt.
               Cast not the fiercenes of thy49. wrath, anger, and displeasure, vpon vs.
               Giue vs not hailestones for raine Ps. 105, 32 Iere. 51, 16. neither flames of fire in our lande: but of thy mercie conuert the thunder into gentle raine, whereby it may bring out fruite abundantlie Ps. 145, 16..
               Sende not among vs either vntimelie, or vntemperate showers which be either noisome to the fruite, and bring the mildewe 1. King▪ 8, verse. 37., or destroie the corne.
               Restraine in like sort the windes and violent tempestes, that they bring none hurt neither to vs, or our goods, euen for Christes sake our Lorde, and Sauior,
               Amen.
            
            
               
               
                  A praier for waiefaring men, and Trauelers.
               
                  O Almightie, eternal, and liuing God, Father of our Lord Iesu Christ, I thanke thee with mine▪ whole hart for sending of thine infinite and vnspeakeable goodnes to manwarde, thine onelie Sonne into this worlde to suffer on our behalfe al the miseries of this life: which in the state of extreeme basenes traueling from one region to another, to preach the Gospel of thy kingdome, suffered no doubt the sondrie infirmities of our mortal bodie.
               For passing through Samaria he was wearie by reason of trauel, and rested himselfe on Iacobs wel Iohn. 4, 6..
               In al things he was like vnto vs Heb. 2, 17. For we haue not an hie Priest Heb. 4, 15. which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in al things tempted like as we are, and yet without sinne.
               In his Name I take my iournie whose wil it is that whatsoeuer we



doe either Col. 3, 17. in worde or deede, we shoulde doe it in the Name of our Lorde and Sauior Christ, giuing thanks vnto thee our God, and Father through him.
               For his sake, which went about doing good Act. 10, 38., and healing al that were oppressed of Satan, I beseech thee, giue thine holie angels charge Psal. 91, 11. Matth. 4, 6. to keepe me in al my waies, and to guide me to and fro in my iournie, euen as Tobie the yonger was guided of the Angel Raphaël Tobit. 5, verse. 5, &amp;c. vnto Gabaël habiting in Rages a citie of the Medes.
               Guide me with strength Ps. 18, 32. and courage; and direct my steps in the course of my iournie, that I wander not out of the right waie into bywaies, neither cast my selfe into dangers.
               And therefore, holie Father, be thou the directer of my waies, and keepe me out of the clawes of spoilers.
               Saue mee from the deuouring iawes of sauage beasts. Compasse me about with thine heauenlie protection, that I fal not into any euils either of soule, or bodie.
               
                  Be thou vnto me a faithful companion as thou wast to Iacob the Patriarch Gen. 28, 15 traueling into Mesopotamia, and descending into Egypt Gen. 46, 4..
               Likewise as thou diddest lead the children of Israël through the red sea Exo. 14, 22, and through the vncomfortable wildernes Deut. 8, 2., going before them by daie in a piller of a cloude Exo. 13, 21, and by night in a piller of fire Neh. 9, 12. to lighten them in the way that they went: vouchsafe to accompanie, gouerne, and direct me in this my iornie.
               Shew mee also such fauor, that wheresoeuer I go I may find godlie men, which may entertaine, lodge, and curteouslie entreate me Mat. 25, 35 Esaie. 58, 7., least otherwise I fal into perils, and be iniuried of the wicked.
               Be thou with me night and daie, that none hurt light vpon me; protect me both against the iniurie of cold, and the vehemencie of heat Gen. 31, 40, and from al enimies deliuer me.
               O Lord, giue me bread to eate Gen. 28, 20, and clothes to put on.
               And as the wise men Matth. 2, verse. 1, &amp;c. by the direction of a star in the East came ioiefullie into Iurie, and afterward being admonished in a dreame so



to doe, returned into their countrie another waie: so my busines being wel finished bring me home againe in safetie, that I may praise thee my God, and Lorde, continuallie in the Congregation of thy Saints.
               O Lorde heare my praier Psa. 39, 13., and with thine eares consider my complaint; holde not thy peace at my teares. For I am a stranger Heb. 11, 13 in this worlde, as al my forefathers were. Our daies like a shadowe vpon the earth 1. Chr. 29, verse. 15. Wisdo. 2, 5. doe passe awaie, and continue not.
               We are strangers, and wander out of our true countrie Heb. 11, 15 1. Pet. 2, 11.. For the daies of our pilgrimage are but short Gen. 47, 9., yet be they full of miserie &amp; troble.
               Giue me grace that I set not my minde on this worlde, but to lift vp mine eies vnto heauen, and desire a better Heb. 11, 16, that is, an heauenlie countrie.
               And as long as wee are absent from the bodie 2. Cor. 5, verse. 6, &amp;c., let vs be of good courage; suffer vs not through feare to faint in afflictions, but firmelie to trust that shortlie we shal returne vnto thine habitation, and there enioy thy sight in deede, &amp; euerlasting



life, where thou, with thy Sonne, and the holie Spirit, liuest, and raignest one eternal God for euermore,
               Amen.
            
            
               A Praier before the receiuing of the holie Communion.
               
                  O Iesu Christ, holie, and eternal God, I miserable man, and wretched sinner acknowledge &amp; confesse, that I am not worthie the least of al thy mercies Gen. 32, 10, &amp; most vnworthie to receaue thee vnder the roofe Matt. 8, 8. Luke. 7, 6. of my soule by participating of thy most blessed bodie and blood. For horrible and infinite are the sinnes wherwith I am defiled.
               Wo is me, Lord, Esaie. 6, 5. for I am a man of polluted lips, and dwel among people that haue vncleane lips. And therefore the verie entrales of mine hart are trobled, and my bones doe shake, because I finde my soule a most vnworthie ghest for so heauenlie a supper.
               
                  And yet againe mine hart is wonderfullie lightened when I cal into minde that thou, the deere sonne of almightie God, camest not into this worlde to cal the righteous Luk. 5, 32. 1. Tim. 1, 15., but sinners vnto repentance. For Mat. 9, 12. they that be whole neede not the Phisition, but they that are sick.
               Besides, I knowe right wel, and constantlie doe beleeue, that notwithstanding my filthines, thou canst make me worthy, which alone canst make that cleane, which is conceaued of vncleane seede Iob. 14, 4., and righteous men of sinners Psa. 51, 7., when thou forgiuest our sins of thy wonted grace, thine holie Spirit being poured vpon vs.
               Through which thy power and mercie, I beseech thee, grant such grace vnto me a sinner, that I may worthilie 1. Cor. 11, verse. 27. approch to this heauenlie Sacrament, least otherwise by mine vnworthines I be made guiltie of thy bodie and blood, and so instead29. of life receaue my iudgement and condemnation.
               Giue grace therefore, that afore I presume to come vnto the participation thereof, I may examine my



selfe 1. Cor. 11, verse. 28. 2. Cor. 13, 5., by calling my sinnes into minde, searching out my waies Lamen 3, verse. 40., &amp; by vnfained and hartie repentance returning vnto thee my Lord, least otherwise by concealing my sinnes, with Iudas the traitor I eate the bread of the Lord against the Lord Augustine vpon Iohn, treatise. 59.: &amp; by abusing thy gentlenes Rom. 2, 4 5. heape vengeance vpon my selfe against the daie of vengeance.
               Make me to confesse my sinnes, and that with hartie sobs, so thou being a faithful and iust God 1. Ioh. 1, 9., wilt pardon al mine offences, &amp; clense me from my sinnes: and wilt not disdaine to accept me into fauor, when I doe not refraine to acknowledge my wickednes.
               Moreouer, poure into me a true and liuelie faith, that I neuer mistrust thy worde annexed to the Sacraments, which promiseth vnto mankinde the remission of sinnes.
               For to eate, or drinke with the mouth onelie is to no purpose, but faith must come therevnto, and apprehende the worde with the promises annexed. For they are the groundes and principles of this sacrament.
               
                  So that whosoeuer giueth credit to these words, Which was giuen, and shed for you, in the remission of sinnes 
                  Matt. 26, vers. 26, &amp;c. Marke. 14, vers. 22. &amp;c. Luke. 22, vers. 19, &amp;c. 1. Corint. 11, vers. 24, &amp;c., the same man hath that which is promised by them, namelie, eternal life, and saluation. For where the remission of sinnes is, there likewise righteousnes, life, and saluation is.
               But he which doubteth of these wordes, he without doubt is an vnworthie receiuer, and commeth vnprepared. For the doubting man neither eateth thy flesh spirituallie, nor yet drinketh thy blood, though carnally, and to our eies he seemeth to consume the sacrament of thy bodie and blood with his teeth and mouth, but his damnation rather. Not because Augustine vpon Iohn, treatise. 26. thy supper is poyson, but for that an euil man taketh a good thing naughtilie.
               Finallie, also grant, that receiuing this thy Sacrament of the newe Testament, I may put of, according to the former conuersation, the old man Eph. 4, 22., which is corrupt according to the lusts of error, and be renued in the spirit of my minde, putting on the newe man Col. 3, 10. Ephe. 4, 24., which after God, is



created in righteousnes, and holines of truth.
               And albeit my nature be such, that I cannot liue without spots of wickednes Augustine concerning Ecclesi. instruc. cap. 53: yet so blesse me, that I may neuer offende willinglie, but altogither depending vpon thy goodnes, whose manner is to pardon the true penitent sinners, may boldelie approch to thine holie supper.
               Especiallie, seeing we haue libertie to enter into the holie place through the blood Heb. 10, 19 by the newe and liuing way which thou hast prepared20. for vs through the vaile, that is, by thy flesh. And seeing we haue21. an high Priest ouer the house of God, make vs to draw nigh with true22. harts, in assurance of faith, sprinkeled in our minds from an euil conscience, and washed in bodie with pure water: cause vs to holde fast23. the profession of our hope without wauering (for he is faithful that promised) and let vs consider one of24. another, to prouoke vnto loue, and to good workes, not forsaking the25. assemblie of the faithful, as the manner of some is, but exhorting



one another, and so much the more, as we see the daie approching,
               Amen.
            
            
               
                  Another praier before the receiuing of the holie Communion.
               
               
                  O Christ the onelie mediator betweene God and man 1. Tim. 2, 5., which of thine ardent and vnspeakeable good wil6. tookest our flesh vpon thee, to become a sacrifice and raunsome for al mankinde: and for the better conceauing of that thy benefit didst ordaine before thy paineful passion, a perpetual memorie of thy loue, and that by erecting a couenant of the newe Testament Matth. 26, vers. 26, &amp;c. Mark. 14, 24 Luke. 22, vers. 19, &amp;c., which testifieth of thy presence, merite, power, and mercie, washing awaie dailie the sinnes of beleeuers:
               And the more effectuallie to cō
                  mend the depenes of this mysterie, didst ordaine this Sacrament in thy last supper being euen readie to go frō thy Disciples vnto thy passiō, the more depelie to fixe it in our harts,



that it neuer slip out of our minds, but dailie in faith, feare, and reuerence, be recorded; and remaine according to thine holie institution, whole and perfect without adding or diminishing from the same.
               For though it be but a mans testament Gal 3, 15. Hebrues. 9, verse. 15, &amp;c., yet if it be confirmed and prooued by the death of the testator, no man diminisheth or addeth therevnto.
               Vnto thee doe I crie, O Sonne of God, which art partaker of our flesh, and bone of our bones, beseeching thee from the bottome of mine hart, that it woulde please thee to giue me grace that with an earnest desire, and due reuerence I may couet to receaue thy supper, and therin thirstinglie to seeke for the nourishment of my soule.
               Remooue from mine hart al loathing, contempt, and curiositie of prophane men, which, set thēselues against thee, and proudlie despise this thine institution, like vnto dogs despising holie things Matt. 7, 6., and vnto hogs treading most precious pearls vnder their feete.
               Lift vp my minde, that in feare



and trembling, in faith and spiritual comfort, I may approch to the worthie receiuing of thy precious bodie and blood, not as hypocrites doe, which hide and dissemble their sinnes; neither as epicures despising both thee and thine holie ordinance.
               And therefore stir vp in me an vnfained desire of this heauenlie nourishment, that from thee the bread of life Ioh. 6, 35. Eccl. 24, 24. Iohu. 4, 10. 14., and fountaine of saluation, I may draw vital iuice to the quickning of my soule.
               In which communion thou bestowest vpon beleeuers both the merits of thine obedience and passion, and also thine other benefits whatsoeuer.
               Besides inwardlie thou dost replenish vs with newe and celestial ioie, in quickening, comforting, teaching and gouerning vs, that so we may haue and get our strength frō thee euen as the branches drawe their iuice and force to fructifie, from the vine.
               Lighten therefore the eies of mine hart, that I may knowe what the hope is wherevnto we are called



                  Eph. 1, 18.; and what the riches of our inheritance are in the Saints Col. 1, 27.; and what exceeding greatnes of thy power and mercie is hid in this supper, and how vnspeakable be the riches of the glorie of this Sacrament, whereby thou communicatest to al and ech of thy faithful together with thy bodie and blood al the treasures of thine heauenlie goodes to be receaued by faith.
               For thine holie and blessed mouth hath saide: I am the bread of life Iohn. 6, 35. which came downe from heauen, he which commeth to mee shal not hunger in any wise, and he that beleeueth on mee shal neuer thirst. And the bread which I shal giue, is my flesh, which I wil giue for the life of the world.
               O most sweete bread heale thouAmbrose. the palate of mine hart, that I may taste the sweetnes of thy loue; heale me of al mine infirmities, that I delight in no fairenes besides thee.
               O most heauenlie whight bread containing within thee al comfort, and the perfect sweetenes of al sauor, which doest alwaies refresh vs, let mine hart eate thee, and with



thy pleasant sauor let al the bowels of my flesh be replenished.
               O thou bread of life, which camst downe from heauen, and giuest life to the world, come into mine hart, and purge me from al filthines of the flesh and spirit: enter thou into my soule, heale, and sanctifie mee both within and without.
               Be thou the buckler, and perpetual defence of my soule and dodie, that I may come vnto thy kingdome the right waie, where we shal not deale with mysteries as in this worlde, but shal beholde thee face to face, when thou hast deliuered the kingdome to God 1. Cor. 15, verse. 24. 28., the Father, and so God shal be al in al,
               Amen.
            
            
               
                  A thankesgiuing after the receiuing of the holie Communion.
               
               
                  O Iesu, high and eternal Priest Heb. 8, 1., sitting on the right hande of the throne of maiestie in the heauens, gouernor of the Saints,
               Thou art an high Priest of good things to come Heb. 9, 11,, which by a greater



and more perfect tabernacle not made with handes, that is to saie, not of this building, neither by the blood of goates, &amp; calues Heb. 9, 12., but by thine owne blood didst enter once into the holie place, and founde eternal redemption, when through the eternal spirite, thou offeredst thy selfe a pure sacrifice without spot, to God, purging our14. consciences from dead workes, to serue the liuing God:
               I yeelde thee hartie thankes for suffering vpō the altar of the crosse a most shameful death, for our sins, and that of thine owne accorde, mooued therevnto by a singular affection of good wil towards vs.
               I blesse thee for instituting this Sacrament of thy bodie and blood in remembrance of our euerlasting redemptiō, that at no time it might slip out of our minds, but be an holie signe, and testimonie of thy perpetual friendship, and a seale of the confirmation of the newe and eternal couenant which thou hast entred into with vs concerning the free remission and forgiuenes of our sinnes.
               
                  I magnifie thee also with al reuerence of mind, for bidding vs miserable men, and sinners both vnto the participation of thy most holie supper, and also to the receiuing of al celestial riches; wherein thou bestowest, and appliest particularlie to euerie of vs, al the merits and good things which by thine obedience and death, thou hast purchased on our behalfe, that we may become partners, and fellow heires of eternal blessednes.
               O sacred banket, wherin heauenlie dainties are set afore vs which reuiue the soule: and thou lambe of God, after a wonderful and mystical manner, giuest thy selfe to refresh the inwarde man.
               We diminish thee not in eating thee Hierom in his agonie., but thou endurest whole perpetuallie. And although the visible signes are consumed, yet canst not thou be deuoured.
               Thou art the meate of the soule, not of the bodie; and fattest our minds, not our bellies.
               Thou changest the eater into thy selfe, and yet art not changed into the eater, as other corporal foode is



changed commonlie.
               So that we participate of thy diuine nature 2. Pet. 1, 4., and thou no whit art altered into our sinful flesh.
               I humbly beseech thee, Sonne of God, by thy most sacred blood shed for vs, giue me grace, that participating of this visible Sacrament, I may withal finde and feele in mine hart the inuisible working of thine heauenlie grace, which is conteined in this mysterie; that this supper may be, as some refreshing vnto my bodie, so a special medicine of my soule.
               Quicken and raise vp in me by this blessed Sacrament a continual remembrance of thy bitter passion, make me to retaine the same firmelie and fresh in my minde, and shew it foorth 1. Cor. 11, verse. 26., as an onelie and sufficient ransome of my redemption, vntil thou returnest.
               Let me neuer doubt of the forgiuenes of my sinnes, which thou assurest me of by thy bodie &amp; blood, in thine holy couenant Matth. 26, vers. 26, &amp;c. Luke. 22, vers. 19, &amp;c., concluded in thy last supper, by the breaking of bread, and giuing foorth the cup to thy chosen Disciples, and by them



to as manie as are incorporated into thy Church through Baptisme:
               That as often as Satan assaileth vs, with his deadlie tentations, we may runne to our sanctuarie, as it were to a strong anchor of defence, apprehending the promise ratified by the seale of this couenant, and neuer giue ouer in fight but stil be refreshed with newe virtue from aboue; nor breake our harts through the consideration of sundrie misfortunes which the vngrateful worlde by the instinct of their capitaine the Diuel, woulde bring vpon vs, but calling into minde thy death, into the which we are baptized, may escape from al calamities;
               So that no tribulation, Rom. 8, 35 nor anguish, nor persecution, neither hunger, nor nakednes, neither perils,38. nor sworde, neither death, neither life may separate vs from our head, wherevpon being made fast by this holie Sacrament receaued, we, as liuing members doe depende;
               And finallie may knowe that we are fed and refreshed by thy flesh and pretious blood, that washed therewith we should not hereafter



giue our selues to carnal pleasures, nor feede vpon the leauen of malice and wickednes, but resisting them, liue in al sinceritie &amp; truth 1. Cor. 5, 8., as it becommeth such as doe eate of the immaculate Paschal lambe, whose life is hid with thee Colo. 3, 3., but when thou shalt be reuealed, then4. shal we also appeare in glorie.
               For this blessed meate doth truelie witnes that our bodies, sprinkled with the virtue of thy quickening flesh, as it were with celestial dewe, shal rise againe vnto immortalitie, and euerlasting glorie.
               Wherefore giue grace, that al thy Saints participating of the bread of eternal life, may be replenished with the fruition of thy blessed sight for euermore in thy celestial paradise,
               Amen.
            
            
               
                  Another thankesgiuing after the receipt of the holie Communion.
               
               
                  I Thank thee, O Christ lambe of God, for offering thy selfe vpon the altar of the crosse to thy father an offering



                  Ephe. 5, 2. and a sacrifice of a sweete smelling sauor to God, for our sinnes to reconcile vs vnto him: for certaintie whereof, and confirmation of our faith, thou hast instituted on our behalfe this holie Sacrament of thy supper; that as often as we receiue the same, we may celebrate thy memorie 1. Cor. 11, verse. 26., and with thankesgiuing remember the merite and frute of thy passion.
               I beseech thee by thy bitter death, stir vp our minds, that by often receiuing this thine ordinance and institution, we may consider howe bitter a death thou didst suffer on our behalfe, and how great the loue was, which draue thee to take so cruel and shameful a death to saue vs: and withal continuallie yeelde, as we are bounde, hartie thanks vnto thee for the same, and after the like sort, answere to our power, that vnspeakeable good wil by our good life, and careful obseruation of thy commandements: and may, when, either through frailetie of our flesh Galat. 6, 1., or by any other fault preuented, we sinne, runne by and by vnto thee by repentance, and, through



consideration of this new and eternal couenant touching the remission of sinnes, made with vs, be erected and vpholden vnto a liuelie and constant hope.
               O sweete Iesu, grant, that, being fast linked vnto thee by this holie mysterie, I may receaue power and strength from thee, beleeuing thy promises, and be wholie addicted therevnto without any doubting, that so my conscience, in feare and trobles, may haue perfect consolation.
               Suffer me not to be separated from the members of thy bodie, which is the Church, whereof thou art head Ephe. 1, 22. 23., fulfilling al in al, but grant, that abiding in thy word and kingdome, I may be without fault in the foundation, &amp; without sinne against my conscience, and walke worthie this Sacrament, forsaking vtterlie and renouncing the Diuel, and al Idolatrie, al vices and carnal desires 1. Pet. 2, 11. Galat. 5, 17. Rom. 13, 14., which fight against the soule. For we cannot be partakers of the Lordes table, and of the Diuels to 1. Cor. 10, verse. 21..
               Make me also to remember that



by this sacrament I am bound to do good vnto others.
               For as manie graines of corne do make one loafe; and manie grapes make one wine: so being manie yet are we but one loafe 1. Cor. 10, verse. 17., and one bodie, inasmuch as we al participate of one bread, and drinke of one cup.
               Ioine vs therfore together, O Sauior of the world, at this common banquet through the band of loue, that we may be fastened vnto thee our head. That, as thou diddest die for vs, so we againe may not feare to suffer, and to giue our liues for the glorie of thy name, that we neuer be separated from thee, neither in life, nor death Rom. 8, 38.
               Make vs also hartilie to loue one another like the true and liuelie members of thy bodie 1. Cor. 12, vers. 17, &amp;c., that, if need require, we may giue our liues for our brethren 1. Ioh. 3, 16.
               Suffer not concord of mindes to be broken. For hee that receiueth the mysterie of vnitie Augustine., and keepeth not the bond of peace, he doth not receaue the mysterie for himselfe, but a testimonie against himselfe.
               Giue grace therefore, that laieng



aside al wrath Coloss. 3, vers. 8, &amp; 13., fiercenes, maliciousnes, and enuie, we may forgiue one another, euen as thou forgiuest vs; and beare one with another for the better auoiding of strife, di

               Remooue awaie al abuses and prophanations of this holie and sacred supper, together with the horrible and Idolatrous adorations inuented by Satan and his members, to the shameful deforming of thy godlie and goodlie institution, but maintaine I humblie beseech thee, the true and vnpolluted vse thereof, til thy pleasure is to returne in the cloudes to iudgement with great power and glorie Mark. 13, verse. 26. Luk. 21, 27., that it neuer be out of remembrance.
               And last of al at our resurrection from death, appoint vs places in thy

               A praier for the Sick.
               
                  O Almightie and merciful God, Father of our Lord Iesu Christ, which through corporal diseases both puttest me in minde of my mortalitie, and also callest to repentance. For thou wilt not the death of a sinner Eze. 33, 11., but that he conuert, and liue:
               Vnto thee doe I crie, O Lorde, rebuke me not in thine anger Psal 6, 1., neither chastise me in thy wrath; haue mercie on me, O Lorde, for I am2. weake; O Lorde, heale me, for my3. bones are vexed.
               My soule is also trobled verie4. sore; but Lorde, how long wilt thou delaie? Returne, deliuer my soule; O saue me, for thy mercies sake.
               Heale me, O Lord Ier. 17, 14., and I shal be whole; saue thou me, and I shal be saued: For thou art my praise.
               
                  Thou hast wounded, and thou wilt heale me; thou hast strooken, and thou wilt cure; thou dost kil, and restore to life againe.
               Wherfore if this my sicknes be not vnto the death, helpe me vpon the bed of my sorow Psal. 41, 3.. Turne the whole palat of my weaknes into ioie.
               Maie it please thee, O Lorde, to deliuer me out of the myre. For the graue wil not acknowledge thee, nor death confesse thee: but the liuing, I saie the liuing wil extol thee for euermore.
               O Lorde, heale me, that I may praise thee al my life long, through my Sauior,
               Amen.
            
            
               
                  Another praier for the Sick.
               
                  O Christ Iesu, Sonne of the liuing God, our Redeemer, and our Mediator for euermore, in our weake flesh thou wentest about the earth preaching Mat. 4, 23. the glad tydings of the kingdome touching the forgiuenes of our sinnes, and curing euerie sicknes,



and euerie disease among the people.
               For thou hast truelie taken vpon thee our infirmities Esai. 53, 4., and borne our paines. For where sinne abounded, there thy grace did more abound Rom. 5, 20. Wherfore I praie, &amp; most humblie beseech thee, be merciful vnto me Psal. 41, 4., heale my soule. For I haue sinned against thee; strengthē it by the sweete comfort of thy Gospel; and confirme my faith: then, if it be thine heauenlie pleasure, restore health vnto my weake bodie.
               If thou wilt, thou canst make me cleane; onelie doe but speake the worde Matt. 8, 8., and I shal be healed.

               But, if it be more expedient for me to die, than to liue, then deale with me according to thy wil Tob. 3, 6., O Lord, and commande my spirit to be receaued in peace; the which I commende into thine hands Ps

                  O Eternal God, which art ful of cōpassion Psa 86, 15., and mercie, slowe to anger, and great in kindnes; thou forgiuest our falts Psal. 32, 1., couerest our sinnes, and dost not impute our iniquities2. vnto vs:
