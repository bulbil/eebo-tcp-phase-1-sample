            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            TO THE MOST
Reuerend Father in God, the Lrd
Arch-Bishop of Canterbury his Grace,
Primate and Metrapolitane of all England,
&amp;c. my very good Lord.
            
               May it please your Grace:
            
            
               I Haue euer, as much as
lay in mee, declined,
and earnestly contended
against all contentions,
and publick
Conferences in poynt
of Religion, with
Romish Priests, and Iesuites. For, Poperie
(as I haue oft learned from your Grace)
is a doctrine of lyes; and as it maintaineth

lyes, so it can be maintained by no better
support, then of lyes. In all conflicts with
men of that faction, though their redoubted
wrastlers, in grappling with our
Diuines, are put to the worst, yet (like
Pericles in the Theatre) bee they indeed
neuer so much foyled, they will go about,
by their eloquence, to perswade the Spectators,
that they receiued not, but gaue
the foyle. And as Lysimachus, when he receiued
a sore wound from Alexander in
his fore-head, had it presently bound vp,
and couered with a glorious Diademe: so
when any of their side are wounded sorely
in any skirmish with vs, their fellowes
presently binde it vp, and couer it with a
Crowne of a surmised victorie. I well
knew, and foretold the Pitcher of the
field, that whatsoeuer the issue of the
combate were, Master Deane of Carlile
and my selfe, should be notwithstanding
conquered in effigie, and led in triumph
in many a Pageant at Doway, Bruxels,
Rhemes, and Rome, as since we haue seene
in Letters, and gazettaes from beyond the
Seas. Omnia praecepi, atque animo mecum

antè peregi. Yet knowing that truth is
strong in her weakest, and falshood is
weake in her strongest Champions; and
being vrgently desired by the friends, and
personally challenged by the enemies of
our most holy Faith, to appeare as a Second
in her sacred &amp; iust quarrel, malui in
illo praesertim legum et iustitiae publicae iustitio
Iesuitas fractos, quàm despectos dimittere: I
chose in that high floate of the Iesuites
pride and hopes, rather by an encounter
to represse their insolencie, then by a refusall
increase their arrogancie. Neither
was the diuine Assistance and benediction
wanting at the Conference, nor since:
for by it the old Gentleman (whose intended
satisfaction drew on this meeting)
was settled (as himselfe vnder his
hand twice professed) and resolued in
that point, which before left a scruple in
his conscience. And by occasion of
this Dispute, the Chronicles of the
Reformed Churches haue beene
better searched into, and some
most vsefull Relations and Treatises
touching the Visibility of the Church,

brought to light, and more publick view
then before. And, albeit his Maiesty, vpon
the first noise and mis-report of this
disputation, seemed to distast it, yet when
the whole truth of that which passed
that day, together with the occasion and
issue thereof, appeared to his Maiesty in
its natiue hiew; the former cloud, which
threatned a bitter showre, was by your
Graces fauourable breath, suddenly
blowne ouer: and then the true Relation
of that Conference, finding the skie
cleere, stole wings to, and from the presse,
and flew freely abroad, euery where
checking and controuling the Iesuits false
Relations, and plucking from their heads
those Lawrell garlands, wherewith they
had crowned their temples, for their
owne noble exployts that day. It could
not bee expected, that this printed Relation
should haue beene otherwise entertained
by Master Fisher and Master Sweet
(the Popish Combatants), then it was;
who, after a month or two, set vpon it
in print, and dealt with it, as the wife of
Anthony did with Tullies
               Because it truly wounded her husband. tongue, after his

death: they thrust it thorow and thorow
with needles, and stabbed it againe and
againe with their poysoned pens; the
one writing an answer to it; the other,
a censure of it. To both these Pamphlets,
this Reply is addressed. In the former part,
Master Fishers Answer to the Fisher catched
in his owne Net, is censured: in the latter,
Master Sweet's Censure is answered. And
because opposita iuxta se posita, magis elucescunt,
I haue printed Master Fisher's Text
with my Reply thereunto, vt dum haeretici
hominis venena lector cognoscit, libentiùs
orthodoxi bibat antidotum. If any thing be
omitted, the occasion and reason of the
omission is not omitted. Had I set down
all the Iesuites battologies,
Idem delicti fierem reprehensor et author.
            
            Whatsoeuer I haue done heerein, I submit
to your Graces censure and fauourable
construction thereof. I acknowledge,
it is not a worthy present for your Grace:
yet because it is
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . my first fruits in this
kinde, it of right belongeth to the high
Priest; the rather, because the growth of
it was vpon your sacred gleabe. The

Stork, which alwaies leaues one of her
young ones in the house where shee
breeds, for the Owner thereof, teacheth
mee this poynt of gratitude, to offer that
to your Grace, which was bred vnder
your Graces roofe;
Siue legas, quo dabo siue tegas.
            
            Did not these, and many other priuate
respects, challenge this dedication to your
Grace: yet the sweet influence which
your Graces gouernment continually distilleth
vpon Gods Inheritance, among vs,
would cause from any heart and pen not
barren, the returne of some sweet spiration
of praises to God, and thanksgiuing
to your Grace for your incessant trauels in
Gods cause. The costly oyntment, which
on Palme-Sunday last flowed abundantly
from your lips, so cheered vp and reuiued
that numberlesse Auditory, that
your Graces Name is as a most fragrant
oyntment, sending foorth a most sweet
sauour through the whole Kingdome.
What should I speake of the most happie
and ioyfull newes of our thrice-noble
Prince's returne out of Spaine: whereof

your Grace was the first siluer Trumpet
to the City? And (God bee blessed for it)
the Trumpet gaue not an vncertaine sound.
Those glorious night-Tapours which
were set so thick together in the streets,
that they made a kinde of Galaxia in the
City, were all kindled early in the morning
at your Graces sacred Lamp. Sicut
Marcelli praelio ad Nolam, saith the Orator,
populus Romanus primò se erexit, posteà multaeres
prosperae consequutae sunt. As the Roman
State, after many disasters, first began
to cheere vp againe at Marcellus his victory
at Nola, and afterwards much good
fortune followed: so, after much sorrow
and more feare, the happy Returne of our
Prince first cheered vp our drooping spirits;
and, after that, many happie things
haue followed: whereof, vnder his Maiestie,
your Grace haue been, and are, together
with your noble Associates in this
high Court of Parliament, the principall
Instruments. Ride on, in the Lords march
prosperously, with your honour, because of
truth and righteousnesse, and your right hands
shall teach your terrible things; terrible

things to the Whore of Babylon, but comfortable
to Christs afflicted Spouse. The
good will of him who dwelt in the bush,
make your Aarons Rod to flourish more
and more, to the glory of his Name, aduancement
of the Truth, honour of the
Priest-hood, and your owne endlesse ioy
and comfort. This we all of the Tribe of
Leui are bound to pray for in generall, and
I my selfe more specially, as beeing
            
               Your Graces most humbly-deuoted
Chaplaine in house, and seruant,
DANIEL FEATLY.
            
         
         
            
            The Preface to the Protestants
Relation of the Conference,
IVNE 27. 1623.
            
            
               BEing commanded by my Lord his Grace of
Canterbury, from his Maiesty, to certifie
the truth of that which passed in a late conference,
in point of Religion, at Sir Humfrey
Linde's house in Sheer-Lane, in London: we,
who were present at the Conference, partly, out of the
fresh memory of such passages as we then obserued; but
especially, by help of such Notes as were taken in the
Conference it self, subscribed by both the Disputants,
drew vp, within a week after, as perfect a Relation of
the substance thereof, as we could: wherein as we added
nothing to the aduantage or preiudice of either party; so
wee omitted nothing of moment, in the Current of the
Arguments and Answers. As for some interlocutory
speeches of the right honourable the Earl of Warwick,
who diuers times seasonably interposed, and, when the
Disputants or standers-by grew into any heat or distemper,
discreetly tempered both sides,
Ille regit dictis animos, &amp; pectora mulcet.
—those passages we inserted
not into our narration, because, the Earle beeing not
then in London, we held it incongruous, without his

Honours knowledge, to vse his name to the King. For
other omissions, the Iesuites are beholding vnto vs: for,
they were in fauour of them; wee beeing loth to bee vngues
in vlcere, to bee thought to rub too hard vpon a
gawle, but rather desirous to carry the whole Relation as
fairly and passably as might be.2. Cor. 12. 13. We had thought, the Iesuites
would haue pardoned vs this wrong.
            After this originall Draught was by vs tendered
to his Grace of Canterbury, and by his Grace deliuered
to the Kings Maiesty, some Copie (as we vnderstand)
was taken, for the satisfaction of a Person of quality:
which, passing from one to another, in the end fell into
the hands of some Stationers; who, without licence or
knowledge of those whom it most concerned, committed
it to the Presse, de questu magis, quàm quaestione
soliciti. And the better to vent this new wine, they
set a faire Garland before the dore, intituling it, The
FISHER caught in his owne Net. Which Title
was not deuised nor prefixed by any of vs: we willingly
leaue the vanity of such affected inscriptions to our Aduersaries,
who make themselues ridiculous in this kinde.
One intituleth his Answer to D. White, WHITE
dyed black. Another cals his woodden Pamphlet,
The Gag of the new Religion, or of the reformed
Gospell. Another, his Reply to M. BELL,
Cecidit BELL, The dolefull knell of THOMAS
BELL. This is not the sound of AARON'S
golden Bell; but rather of the tinkling Cymball
mentioned by Saint PAVL, 1. Cor. 13. Fancies and
Iigs make no good Church-musick.

                  Nobis non licet esse tam disertis,
                  Qui Musas colimus sacratiores.
               
            
            
               
For the Title therefore, wee approoue it not: but
for the Conference it selfe, it containeth nothing but the
truth, whatsoeuer the Aduersaries giue out to the contrary,
who (as it seemeth) hold it a work of supererogation,
to forge and coyne signall and transcendent Leasings
for the Catholick Cause; for, although the Iesuites, at
this Conference, were often vncertaine, and alwaies
very slow and tardy in their Answers, and (in
fine) answered nothing, but that they would not answer
Doctor FEATLY his instance in CHRIST and his
Apostles; yet haue they or their Schollers proclaimed
in Gath, and published in Ascalon, such a victory as
neuer was heard; much like the wonderfull coniunction
of the superior Planets, which was ne

                  er

            About a weeke after the Conference, the noble Earle
of Warwick, who had bin present at it, hauing occasion
to passe ouer the Seas, and comming to Saint Omers,
had the Company of Doctor Weston at his Inne; to
whom this Doctor (taking the Earle for a Romane Catholick)
told for fresh and most happy newes out of England,
that at a Conference betweene Father FISHER
and SVVEET, Iesuites, and two Protestant Ministers,
in London, the Iesuites had quitted themselues so well,
and the Catholique faith preuailed so farre, that two
Earles, and an hundred other of the Auditory
were gayned to the Church of Rome by this
Incounter: of these two Earles, the party to
whom hee spake, was one, who could not but smile
at this Relation.

                  
                  Risit Atlantiades; et me mihi, perfide, prodis,
                  Me mihi prodis, ait?
               
            
            A pretty Comick Scene, where the Spectator is made
an Actor, and a false person put vpon him to his face:
a renowned and constant Protestant, borne downe to be
a Romish Proselyte. As for the reuolt of the other Earle,
and pretended Centurie of Protestant Romane Conuerts,
we beleeue it as firmely, as thatVitae Sanct. Brigittae. Vitae S. Aldelmi. S. BRIGET laid her
Wimple, and Saint ALDELME his Chesible vpon a
beame of the Sunne, which supported them. That Saint

a stolne sheep to bleate in the belly of him that had eaten it.

                  ryers, by knocking certaine pins out of the timber,
caused that late &amp; lamentable fall of the floar: wherin
about 200 Papists were assembled, and neere a 100
slaine. They who teach pious frauds, and write of holy
hypocrisy, and doctrinally deliuer the lawfulnesse of
equiuocation, may securely report, whatsoeuer maketh
for the Catholique Cause. The more incredible and
palpable the Lie is, the more merit in him that maketh
it, and in them that beleeue it. Popery is a doctrine
composed of Lies: and Philosophy teacheth, that all
things are fed and maintained by such things of which
they are bred and made. The aliments of Popery must
bee correspondent to the elements of which it consisteth:
and verily as hee said in the Poet, Si ius violandum
est, Regni causa violandum, if a man must transgresse
the Law of honesty and Iustice, he must doeit for a Kingdome:

so it is like they are resolued, if a man must lye,
certainely hee must lye for the good of the Catholick Religion;
and if lie in so good a cause, lye to some purpose.
            The first report concerning the issue of this Conference,
was of a silly woman, said to be present, and conuerted
thereby to the Romish faith, who forsooth stamped
vpon her English Bible, and solemnly renounced
the Protestant Religion vpon it; protesting, she would
neuer trust hereticall Translation any more. But, alas!
this was but a silly lye, made by some p

                  •
               ouice of
the petty forme, to see how a lye in this kinde would
take. The higher Schollers in the Iesuites Schoole,
thought it behooued them to make a Catholick or vniuersall
lye for the Catholick cause, by giuing out, that
the whole company of Protestants present at that Conference,
was gayned to the Romish faith, yea, and many
more Protestants then were there also for 100, some say,
400▪ is the summe of the supposed Conuerts; whereas
there were not neere a hundred persons in both parties
in all at the Conference; and (as wee conceiue) neere
20. were professed Papists, and knowne Recusants: and
for the rest, which were Noble-men, Gentle-men, and
Gentle-women of quality, with some few Diuines, there
was not one of them any way staggered in Religion by
this meeting; but on the contrary, they haue openly profest,
that they were much established and confirmed in
the truth of the Protestant Religion by it: and Master
BVGGES himselfe, (whose satisfaction by this
Conference was principally intended) who before had
doubted of our Church, after this Disputation, professeth

himselfe fully resolued through the mercy of
God: to whose grace we commend all that loue the Truth
in sincerity.
            As for those, who contrary to the euidence of truth,
and so many testimonies beyond all exception, are yet resolued
to beleeue what the Iesuites report for their owne
aduantage in their owne cause; the Iesuites, wee say,
who maintaine, that a man may vtter an vntruth in
words without the guilt of Veniall sinne, so hee be sure
to make it vp by a mentall reseruation: vpon such as
stand thus affected, wee bestow the blessing of

            To the courteous Reader.
            I Intreat thee, courteous Reader, to vnderstand, that the greater part of this book
was printed in the time of the great Frost; when, by reason that the Thames
was shut vp, I could not conueniently procure the proofs to be brought vnto mee,
before they were wrought off: whereupon it fell out, that very many grosse escapes
passed the Presse, and (which was the worst fault of all) the third part of the book is
left vnpaged. This defect I finde no other means to remedy for the present, than
to referre thee to the letters of the Printers Alphabet, set vnder the Page. Thus
therefore, I pray thee, correct the Errata following.
         
         
            Faults escaped.

            THE OCCASION
and issue of the late Conference
had betweene Dr. White, Deane of Carleil,
and Dr. Featly, with Mr. Fisher and
Mr. Sweet, Iesuites, was this
as followeth.
            
               
                  EDward Bugges Esquire, (about
the age of 70 yeeres) beeing
lately sicke, was sollicited by
some Papists then about him,
to forsake the Protestant faith;
telling him, there was no hope
of saluation without the Church; there was no
Catholique Church, but theirs; and to beleeue
the Catholique Church, was the Article of his
Creed; and by it there could no other Church
bee meant, but the Church of Rome, because it
could not bee prooued by all the Protestants in

the Kingdome, that they had any Church before
Luther.
            
            This Gentleman beeing much troubled in
his minde with these and the like suggestions,
who all his life time had bin and professed himself
a religious Protestant, becam now more sick
in minde then body: and if by Gods mercifull
goodnesse he had not recouered of this sicknesse,
it is to be feared he had fallen both from his Mother
Church, and his former faith, as some of
the neerest of his owne bloud (to his great
griefe) haue lately beene seduced by like inticements.
            After his recouery, beeing still much troubled
in minde with these former suggestions of the
Popish Priests, he repaired to Sir Humfrey Lynde,
Knight: who, by reason of his alliance and long
acquaintance with him, gaue the best satisfaction
he could to his said Cousin Master Bugges; who
seemed to take content in such his conferences,
and to be well satisfied by him in all points.
            But the Popish Priests and Iesuites not desisting
to creepe-in further where they had once
made a breach, perseuered still in questioning
him, Where his Church was before Luther?
Whereupon hee repayred againe to Sir Humfrey
Lynde, and required some further satisfaction of
him concerning that demand. And thereupon
Sir Humfrey Lynde told him, It was first in Christ
and the Apostles; consequently also conspicuous
in the Primitiue Church for 600 yeeres after

Christ: after which time some errors crept into
the Church, as diseases into a mans body: so that
the Church, which Luther and we acknowledge,
was in generall the same Christian Church, as
his body was the same substantiall body, beeing
now well, and lately sick, though different in the
qualities.
            And for the better strengthening of his mind,
the said Sir Humfrey Lynde inuited him to his
house in the Countrey, thereby the better to
preuent the daily sollicitation of those dangerous
seducers. And after his returne to London, the said
Sir Humfrey Lynde going to Master Bugges his
house in Drury-lane to visit him, found Master
Fisher the Iesuite there: where, after some debates
about Religion, and the visibility of the Church,
M. Fisher called for pen &amp; inke, and set down this
question in terminis, thereto adding vnder his
hand, that he would answer vpon it negatiuely,
as challenging and expecting opposers, deliuering
also the paper into the hands of the said Sir
Humfrey Lynde: who vpon view of it, answered
that it was an historicall question, and not so proper
for disputation. But Master Fisher vrging it,
Sir Humfrey told him, if he would goe to Doctor
Whites, (where formerly he had beene) the said
Doctor would easily resolue those doubts.
Which beeing refused by the Iesuite, the said
Sir Humfrey did then returne him his paper againe,
and so left him.
            About two daies after, Master Bugges repaired

to Sir Humfrey Lynde, and intreated him (for his
satisfaction) to giue Master Fisher a meeting;
saying, that Master Fisher had againe told him,
that he would maintaine what he had set down,
and that our Diuines could not prooue our
Church visible before Luthers time. Whereupon
Sir Humfrey told him, that D. White and Doctor
Featly were to dine with him vpon Fryday
following: and if after dinner Master Fisher
would come thither with foure or six at the
most, they should bee admitted for his sake and
his wises, who (by reason of such sollicitation)
were troubled in their mindes, and satisfaction
should be giuen as occasion required. And these
were the true causes of the meeting, as is before
declared. Vpon which Fryday, beeing the
twenty seuenth of Iune, 1623. Master Fisher, Master
Sweet, Iesuites, and some others with them,
came to Sir Humfrey Lyndes house, into a little
dining-roome; where they found the aforesaid
Master Bugges, his wife and children, and others
of Sir Humfreys friends, that had then dined with
him, together with some others also: whose
comming in, as the said Sir Humfrey did not
expect, so hee could not with ciuility put them
forth his house, but did instantly cause his doores
to bee locked vp, that no more might enter in:
notwithstanding which his command, some others
also came in scatteringly, after the conference
began.
            At the same time and place, Doctor White and

Doctor Featly beeing inuited to dinner by Sir
Humfrey Lynde, and staying a while after, had notice
giuen them, that Master Fisher and Master
Sweet, Iesuites, were in the next roome ready to
conferre with them, touching a question set
downe by Master Fisher, vnder his owne hand, in
these words, viz.
            
            Whether the Protestant Church was in all ages visible,
and especially in the ages going before Luther.
And whether the names of such visible Protestants
in all ages can be shewed and prooued out of
good Authors.
            This question beeing deliuered to the parties
aboue-named, and it beeing notified vnto them,
that there were certaine persons, who had bin
sollicited, and (remaining doubtfull in Religion)
desired satisfaction especially in this point; the
said Doctors were perswaded to haue some
speech with the Iesuites, touching this point; the
rather, because the Priests and Iesuites doe daily
cast out papers, and disperse them in secret:
in which they vaunt, that no Protestant Minister
dareth encounter them in this point.
            
               
               A Relation of vvhat passed in a
Conference touching the visibility of the
Church, Iune xxvii. 1623.
               
               AT the beginning of this meeting, when
the disputants were set, D. Featly drew
out the paper, in which the question aboue
rehearsed was written, with these words
in the margent, viz. I will answer that it was not;
demanded of M. Fisher, whether this were his
own hand? Which after he had acknowledged,
D. Featly began as followeth.
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . To this vniuersall demand,
requiring rather an historicall large volume, then
a Syllogisticall briefe dispute, we answer, that
                  1. Although diuine infallible faith is not
built vpon deduction out of humane history, but
vpon diuine reuelation, as is confessed by your
owne Schoolmen, and expresly by Cardinall
Bellarmine: Historiae humanae faciunt tantùm fidem
humanam, cui subesse potest falsum: Humane histories
and records beget onely an humane faith, or
rather credulity subiect to error, not a diuine
and infallible beliefe, which must bee built vpon
surer ground.
                  2. Although this question be grounded vpon
vncertaine and false supposals: for, a Church
may haue bin visible, yet not the names of all
visible professors thereof now to be shewed and

prooued out of good Authors: there might bee
millions of professors, yet no particular and authenticall
record of them by name: Records
there might bee many in antient time, yet not
now extant, at least for vs to come by;
                  Yet wee will not refuse to deale with you in
our owne question, if you in like manner will
vndertake the like task in your own defence, and
maintaine the affirmatiue in the like question,
which we now propound vnto you heere in writing.
                  Whether the Romish Church (that is a Church holding
the particular entire doctrine of the now Romanists,
as it is comprised in the Councell of Trent)
was in all ages visible, especially in the first 600
yeeres. And whether the names of such visible
or legible Romanists in all ages can be shewed and
prooued out of good Authors.
               
               Heere D. Featly reading this question, through
a mistake, in stead of out of good Authors, read,
out of Gods Word. Whereunto M. Fisher replied,
No: I will prooue it out of good Authors.
               
               Then said one that sate at the TableM. Alesbury.
                  , By no
meanes can M. Fisher endure to demonstrate his
Church out of Gods Word.
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  God is a good Author, M. Fisher:
but it is true, I did mistake. What say you to the
condition? Will you vndertake to name visible
Papists in all ages, out of good Authors?
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  I will, so you prooue the Visibility of your
Church.
               
               
                  
Heere an order was set downe, that D. Featly
should for an houre and a halfe oppose M. Fisher
in this question; and afterwards M. Fisher for
the last houre and halfe should oppose D. White
in the other question, for the Visibility of the
Romane Church.
               
                  
                     M. Sweet.
                  Before you proceed to dispute, I
desire, these conditions may bee assented vnto on both
sides:

                        1. That all bitter speeches be forborne.
                        2. That none speake but disputants.
                     
                  
               
               Which conditions were well approoued by
the whole company.
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  I desire a third to bee added thereunto,
viz. that both the Opponent and Respondent
be tyed to Logick Forme.
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  I hold not that condition fit,
because the company vnderstands not Logick
Forme.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  There are of the company that
vnderstand Logick as well as you or I, and the
rest are men of vnderstanding and reason: therefore
I am resolued to keepe Logick Forme, and
expect from you direct answers.
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  You your selfe confesse, that this question
is not to be handled syllogistically.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  I said indeed, that it required rather
a large historicall volume, then a briefe
syllogisticall Dispute: the more you too blame,
to propound such a question; and my taske the
harder: yet, beeing propounded as a question,

I will keep my self to Logicke Forme. But before
I propound my argument, I craue leaue, in fewe
words to lay open the vanity of the vsuall discourse,
wherewith you draw and delude many
of the ignorant and vnlearned. You beare them
in hand, that there was no such thing in the
world as a Protestant, before Luther; and that
all the world before his time, beleeued as you
doe: That your Church hath not bin onely visible
in all Ages, and all times, but eminently
conspicuous and illustrious: which is such a notorious
vntruth, that I heer offer before all this
company, to yeeld you the better, and acknowledge
my self ouercome, if you can produce out
of good Authours, I will not say, any Empire or
Kingdome, but any City, Parish or Hamlet,
within 500. yeeres next after Christ, in which
there was any visible assembly of Christians to
bee named, maintaining and defending either
your Trent Creed in generall, or these poynts of
Popery in speciall; to wit,
                  1. That there is a treasury of Saints merits,
and superaboundant satisfactions at the Popes
disposing.
                  2. That the Laitie are not commanded by
Christs institutions, to receiue the Sacrament of
the Lords Supper in both kindes.
                  3. That the publicke seruice of God in the
Church, ought, or may bee celebrated in an vnknowne
Tongue.
                  4. That priuate Masses, wherein the Priest

sayth, Edite et bibite ex hoc omnes, Eate and drinke
yee all of this, and yet eateth and drinketh himselfe
onely, are according to Christs institution.
                  5. That the Popes pardons are requisite or vsefull,
to release soules out of Purgatory.
                  6. That the effect of the Sacrament dependeth
vpon the intention of the Minister.
               
               
                  
                     M. Sweet.
                  These are scholasticall points, not fundamentall.
               
               
                  D. White.
                  
                  Those things which are defined in
your Councell of Trent, are to you matters fundamentall.
                  Whatsoeuer article denied makes a man an
hereticke, is fundamentall.
                  But the deniall of any of these, makes a man
an hereticke:
                  Therefore to you, euery one of these articles
is fundamentall.
               
               To which argument nothing being answered,
D. Featly proceeded.
               
                  7. That extreme vnction is a Sacrament,
properly so called.
                  8. That wee may worship God by an Image.
                  9. That the sacred Hoast ought to bee eleuated,
or carried in solemne procession.
                  10. That Infidels and impious persons, yea
Rats and Mice, may eate the body of Christ.
                  11. That all ecclesiasticall power dependeth
of the Pope.
                  12. That hee cannot erre in matter of faith.
                  13. That hee hath power to canonize Saints.
                  
                     
14. To institute religious orders.
                  15. To depose Kings, &amp;c. which latter points
and the like I leaue to D. White, to mayntaine
against you, when (according to your promise)
you doe vndertake to name visible and legible
Romanists in all ages.
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  After you haue proued your Church visible
in all ages, and named the professours thereof, I
will satisfy you in your particulars.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  In the meane-while, name but one
Father, but one Writer of note who held the
particulars aboue-named, for 500. yeeres after
Christ. To which instant demand of D. Featly,
nothing was answered.
               
               
                  Sr. Humfrey Lynde. M. Sweet,
                  proue mee but
this one point out of Saint Augustine, namely,
Transubstantiation, or satisfy such arguments as I
shall bring you out of Saint Augustine to the contrary,
and I will promise you to goe to Masse.
               
               To which M. Sweet made no other answer then
this: That is not now to the question.
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  I expect your argument, Doctor Featly.
                  
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  There are two meanes only, to
proue any thing by necessary inference; to wit,
a Syllogisme and an Induction: other formes of argument
haue no force, but as they are reducible
to these. I proue the visibility of our Church by
both; and first, by a Syllogisme.
                  That Church, whose faith is eternall and perpetuall,
was euer visible in the professours thereof.
                  
                     
But, the faith of the Protestant Church is eternall
and perpetuall:
                  Therefore the faith of the Protestant Church
was euer visible in the Professours thereof.
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  You conclude not the question.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  There are two Quaeres in your
question: first, Whether the Protestant Church
was in all ages visible; and secondly, Whether
the names of such visible Protestants in all ages,
can bee shewed. I haue concluded in my Syllogisme,
the first Quaere.
                  
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  There are not two Quaeres, or parts in
the question: it is but one question.
               
               
                  D. White.
                  
                  Where there are two propositions
with two distinct Vtrums, there are two questions:
But heer are two propositions with two
distinct vtrums; to wit, whether the Protestant
Church, &amp;c. and whether the names, &amp;c.
                  
                  Therefore there are two Quaeres, or parts in
the question.
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  Conclude any thing Syllogistically, D.
Featly.
                  
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  You your self make the first part a
question by it selfe: for, at the margent ouer against
the first part, Whether the Protestant Church
was euer visible? you write, I will answer, It was not:
which words can haue no Construction, if you
referre them to both parts, or at all to the latter
part; to wit, Whether the names can be a shewed?
                  
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  Let vs heare a Syllogisme.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  In this copulatiue proposition

which you offer for a question, and require mee
to proue, either you deny both parts, or one
onely; if both, I am to proue both, one after the
other; if one onely, then you grant the other.
A copulatiue is not true, vnlesse both parts bee
true. Doe you deny both, or one onely?
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  I say, they are but one; for, the later
part is to expound the former: for, I meane by visible, so
visible, that the names of such visible Protestants may
bee shewed.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  This is to confound two distinct
questions in one: For, a Church may haue bin
visible, and yet the names of such visible Professours
not now to bee shewed.
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  They are my words, and I am best able
to expound my owne meaning.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  An exposition, which the construction
of the words will not beare, is not to be
receiued. But the construction of the words will
not beare this your expositiō: Therfore it is not
to be receiued. And is a coniunction copulatiue,
&amp; must adde some-what to that which goes before.
It is all one, as if you should expound the
words of the Apostle, Prouide honest things before
God and men; before God, that is, before men.
               
               
                  
                     M. Sweet.
                  What need you stand so much vpon
this: if there were visible men, certainly they may bee
named. Name your visible Protestants, and it sufficeth.
A Romanist standing by named M. Bolton.
                     Name visible Protestants in all ages:

                     Realls, you stand so much vpon naming.

Will you vndertake to name visible Papists
in all ages?The same Romanist standing by.
                  
                  If neither you nor wee can name visible professours
of our Religions in all ages, for ought I knowe, the best
way for vs is to bee all naturall men.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  This is the right reason of a Naturall.
                  
               
               
                  
                     M. Sweet.
                  If there were visible Protestants in
all ages, certainly they may bee named.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  That is a Non sequitur, for the reasons
beforenamed by mee. What say you to a
people of Africa, who (if we may beleeue Plinie)
haue no names at all?
               
               
                  
                     M. Bolton.
                  Yet they haue descriptions, and may
bee knowne by some Periphrasis.
                  
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  What say you then to the Heretikes
called Acephali, who are so called, because
their Head and Authour cannot bee named, nor
particularly described? Yet the Authour was a
visible man. Are all visible mens names vpon
Record? Are all the Records that were in former
times, now to bee produced?
               
               Heer diuers of Master Fishers company, called,
Names, names, names.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  What? Will nothing content you
but a Buttery-booke? You shall haue a Buttery-booke
of names, if you will stay a while.
               
               Heere, diuers of the Auditors wished D.
Featly not to proceed any further in the disputation,
vnlesse Master Fisher would suffer him,
according to the lawes of all disputation, first,

to conclude the first part of his copulatiue Que
                     •
                  stion;
and then, the second. Yet Doctor Featly'
desirous to bring the disputation to some better
issue before he left it, was content to yeeld to M.
Fishers vnreasonable demand, and conclude both
parts of the copulatiue Question in one Syllogisme.
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  That Church, whose faith is eternall
and perpetuall, is so visible, that the Names
of some Professors thereof may be shewed in all
Ages.
                  But, the faith of the Protestant Church is eternall
and perpetuall:
                  Therefore the Protestants Church is so visible,
that the Professors thereof may bee shewed
in all Ages.
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  Faith eternall? Who euer heard of faith
eternall? Saint Paul saith, that faith ceaseth.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  You haue a purpose, M. Fisher, to cauill:
you knowe my meaning well enough by
the tearm perpetuall; to wit, that Christian faith
which hath continued from Christs first publishing
it, till this present, and shall continue vntill
his second Coming.
                  The Church which houldeth this faith, you
beleeue, shall bee so visible, that the Names of
the Professors thereof may bee shewed in all
ages.
                  But, the Protestant Church holdeth this perpetuall
faith:
                  Therefore it hath been so visible, that the

Names of the Professers thereof may be shewed
in all Ages.
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  Your Argument is a fallacy, called Petitio
principij.
                  
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  
                     A demonstration à causâ or à priori,
is not petitio principii.
                  But, such is my Argument:
                  Therefore my Argument is not petitio principii.
                  
                  Is it not a sounder Argument, to prooue the
Visibility of the Professers from the truth of
their faith, than (as you doo) the truth of your
faith from the Visibility of Professers? Visible
Professers argue not a right faith. Hereticks, Mahumetans,
and Gentiles, haue visible professers of
their impieties; yet wil it not hence follow, that
they haue a right beleef. On the contrary, wee
knowe by the promises of God in the Scripture,
that the Church which maintains the true faith,
shall haue alwaies Professers more or less visible.
               
               
                  
                     M. Sweet.
                  You ought to proue the truth of your
Church à posteriori; for, that is to the question; and
not à priori.
                  
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  Shall you prescribe mee my weapons?
Is not an Argument à priori, better than an
Argument à posteriori? This is, as if in battell you
should enioyne your enemy to stab you with a
knife, and not with a sword or dagger. I will vse
what weapons I list: take you what buckler you
can.
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  A Proof à posteriori is more demonstratiue
than à priori.
                  
               
               
                  
                  M. Alesbury.
                  
                  Heer M. Fisher sheweth his Academicall
learning, in preferring a demonstration
à posteriori, before that which proceeds à priori.
Is not a demōstration of the effect frō the cause,
more excellent, than of the cause by the effect?
               
               From this place, and so forward, it was agreed
by the Disputants, that the Arguments and Answers
should be taken by one common Writer;
and that the Opponent, Dr. Featly, should set his
hand to each seuerall Syllogism; and the Respondent,
Mr. Fisher, to his seuerall Answers.
               
                  Dr. Featly.
                  
                  That Church, which is so visible as
the Catholique Church ought to be, and as the
Popish Church is pretended by M. Fisher to bee,
is so visible, that the Names of the Professours
thereof may be produced and shewed.
                  But, the Protestant Church is so visible, as the
Catholique Church ought to be, and as the Popish
Church is pretended by M. Fisher to bee:
                  Therefore the Protestant Church is so visible,
that their Names may be produced.
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  I deny the Minor.
                  
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  That Church,Minor probatur whose faith is eternal
and perpetuall, and vnchanged, is so visible, as
the Catholick Church ought to be, and the Popish
Church is pretended by M. Fisher to be.
                  But, the faith of the Protestant Church is eternall,
perpetuall, and vnchanged:
                  Therefore the Protestant Church is so visible,
as the Catholique Church ought to be, and the
Popish Church is pretended by M. Fisher to bee.
               
               
                  
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  I distinguish the Maior. That Church
whose faith is perpetuall and vnchanged, so as the
Names can bee shewed, is so visible as the Catholique
Church ought to be, and as M. Fisher pretends the Roman
Church to be, I grant it.
                  That Church whose faith is perpetuall and vnchanged,
yet so, as the Names cannot be shewed in all Ages,
is so visible as the Catholique Church ought to bee, and
as M. Fisher pretends the Roman Church to be, I deny
it. To the Minor I apply the like distinction, and
consequently to the Conclusion in the same manner.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  What? Answer you to the Conclusion
also? This is a Strain of new Logick.
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  Tolle distinctionem.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  A strange distinction of the etemity
of faith by Professers to be named,All this was spoken, but not committed to writing. and not to
bee named. What are Professers nominable or
innominable, to the eternity of faith?
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  Conclude that which I deny, that the
Protestant Church is so eternall, as the Names of visible
Protestants in all Ages may be shewed.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  That Church whose faith is the
Catholique and Primitiue faith, once giuen to
the Saints, without which no man can be saued,
is so perpetuall &amp; visible, as the Names of some
of that Church may be shewed in all Ages.
                  But,Tollitur distinctio. the faith of the Protestant Church is the
Primitiue and Catholique faith, once giuen to
the Saints, without which none can be saued:
                  Therefore the faith of the Protestant Church
is so perpetuall and visible, as the Names of some

of that Church may be shewed in all Ages.
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  I answer the Minor. If this Proposition
bee taken simply in it selfe, I absolutely deny it: but if
this Proposition bee considered (as it must bee) as related
to the first question, and the end thereof, I further
adde, that it is not pertinent to that end for which the
whole Dispute was intended, to weet, to shew to those,
who are not able by their owne ability to finde out, the infallible
faith necessary to saluation, without learning it
of the true visible Church of Christ: and consequently,
the Visibility of the Church is first to be shewed, before
the truth of doctrine in particular shall be shewed.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  First,These words were also spoken but not set down by the Writer. what speak you of those who
are not able by their owne abilities to finde out
faith? Is any man able by his owne ability, without
the help of diuine grace?
                  Secondly, what helpeth the Visibility, to confirm
the truth of the Church? Visibility indeed
prooues a Church, but not the true Church.
               
               Heer M. Fisher alleaged some words out of D.
Field of the Church, supposing thereby to iustifie
his former Answer. Whereunto D. Featly promised,
Answer should be made when it came to
their turn to answer: now hee was by order to
oppose M. Fisher.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  The Summe of your former Answer,
was, that the Minor of my former Syllogisme
was both false and impertinent. It is neither
false nor impertinent. Therefore your Answer
is false and impertinent. And first, my Minor
is not false.
               
               
                  
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  I answer to the Antecedent, that it is
both false and impertinent: but I adde, that for the present
it must first be prooued to be pertinent, or else it diuerteth
vs from the chief end of our Dispute, which
was (as I said before), that infallible truth may bee
learned of the true visible Church; and not the true visible
Church, by first finding euery particular infallible
truth; and by that to conclude which is the true visible
Church.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  I proue, that the Minor is pertinent.
                  That Minor Proposition, which, together with
the Maior, doth necessarily and directly inferre
the Conclusion of the Minor last denied, is pertinent
to the probation of that Minor denied.
                  But the Minor Proposition of the third Syllogisme,
doth necessarily and directly inferre the
conclusion of the Minor last denied:
                  Therefore the Minor of that Syllogism is pertinent.
                  Note, that M. Fishers Answers to euery one of
these Syllogismes, were penned by him verbatim
with the aduice of M. Sweet, and one other,
suggesting priuately, and amending what they
thought fit. Which breeding much delay, irkesom
to the hearers, and the Opponent then saying,
You are very long,Register of the Court of Wards. M. Fisher: M. Chamberlane, standing
by, said, Let him alone: for, he and his learned
Councell are not yet agreed.
                  
               
               
                  
                     M Fisher.
                  I distinguish the Maior. That Minor proposition,
which together with the Maior doth necessarily
and directly inferre the conclusion of the Minor, in

such manner as it may serue for the purpose to which
the whole Dispute is ordained, I grant it to be pertinent.
But if it doe inferre the conclusion, yet not in such manner
as it may serue for that purpose for which the whole
Dispute was ordained▪ I deny the Maior.
                  
               
               Heere the Disputants iarred, and so the Writer
ceased: yet that which followeth, was then
deliuered by them.
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  That Minor which together with
the Maior inferres the proposition last denied, the
whole processe hauing beene per direct a media, is
pertinent to that purpose to which the Dispute
is ordained.
                  But this Minor, together with the Maior, directly
and necessarily inferres the proposition last
denied, the whole processe hauing beene per directa
media.
                  
                  Therefore it is pertinent to that purpose to
which the Dispute is ordained.
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  Your Media in your Syllogismes were
directa, but they tended not ad directum finem.
                  
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  This is a Bull. M. Fisher. Media directa?
yet not addirectum finem? that is, direct,
and not direct? for Media are said to be directa, only
ratione finis, in regard of the end.
               
               
                  
                     M. Sweet.
                  Is there not a fault in arguing, called
transitio à genere in genus, When a man by arguing
quite leaues the maine question and subiect?
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  I acknowledge, that transitio à genere
in genus, is a fault in disputing: but I neuer heard,
that the inference of the effect by the cause, was

                     transitio a genere in genus: such was my argument.
For, faith in a right beleeuer produceth profession
and confession thereof, which makes a visible
member; and the like profession of many
members, a visible Church. Where the cause is
perpetuall, the effect must needs bee perpetuall.
Therefore where the faith is perpetuall, the profession
thereof must needs be; and consequently
the Visibility of the professors thereof. Is this
transitio à genere in genus?
                  
               
               
                  D. Good.
                  
                  M. Sweet, you once learned better
Logick in Cambridge, then you shew now.
                  Heere againe those of M. Fishers side calling
for names, Where are your names? D. White
sayd,
               
               
                  D. White.
                  
                  This is nothing but an apparant tergiuersation:
you will not answer any argument
directly, nor suffer vs to proceed in our argument,
and therefore I require you M. Fisher, according
to the order mentioned in the beginning,
for each party to haue an houre and a half,
that you now oppose, and suffer me to answer.
Prooue by Christ and his Apostles, or by any of
the Fathers, for the first 600 yeeres, these present
Tenets of the Romane Church, viz.
                  
                  1. That all power of order and Iurisdiction
in respect of the Churches, is to be deriued from
the Church of Rome.
                  
                  2. That no Scripture, sense or translation
thereof is authenticall, vnlesse the same were receiued
from the Church of Rome.
                  
                  
                     
3. That the Romane Church onely was and
is the authenticall Custos of vnwritten traditions.
                  4. That all generall Councels were called
by the sole authority of the Pope, and that hee
might ratify and disannuall whatsoeuer pleased
him in them.
                  5. That the Pope onely had power to canonize
Saints.
                  6. That the Pope had or hath power to depose
Princes.
                  Prooue all or any of these, and we will neither
carp nor cauill about names, but answer directly,
without all delayes, euasions or tergiuersations.
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  When you, Doctor White, or Doctor
Featly, haue prooued your Church to bee visible in all
Ages, and named visible Protestants, then I promise
you to prooue the Visibility of the Catholique Romane
Church: but that is not done by you yet.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  It had bin done, but for your delayes
and tergiuersations. Answer briefly and
directly to my former argument, and I will descend
to my Induction, and produce the names
of such eminent persons as in all Ages haue
maintained the substantiall points of faith, in
which wee differ from your Romane Church.
                  That Church whose faith is the Catholique
and Primitiue faith, once giuen to the Saints,
without which none can bee saued, is so visible,
that the names of the professors thereof in all Ages
may bee shewed and prooued out of good
Authors.
                  
                     
But the Protestant Church is that Church,
whose faith is the Catholique and Primitiue
faith, once giuen to the Saints, without which
none can be saued:
                  Therfore the Protestants Church is so visible,
that the names of the professors thereof may be
shewed in all Ages, &amp;c.
                  The Maior is, ex concessis. What say you to the
Minor?
                  
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  I distinguish the Minor.
                  
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  Vpon what tearme doe you distinguish?
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  I distinguish of the proposition, not of
any tearme.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  Heere is againe another straine of
new Logick, to distinguish of a proposition, and
apply the distinction to no tearme: howsoeuer,
I am glad to heare you distinguish, and not simply
to deny, that the Protestant faith is the Catholique
Primitiue faith. Mark, I beseech you,
you that are present, that M. Fisher demurres
vpon the proposition; his conscience will not
suffer him simply to deny, that the Protestant
faith is the Catholique Primitiue faith: we simply
and slatly, and in down-right tearmes deny,
that your present Tridentine faith is the Catholique
Primitiue faith.
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  I answered you before, that your Minor
is false and impertinent.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  I have prooued already, that it is
pertinent: what say you to the truth of it?
               
               
                  
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  This is to diuert from the question,
The question is not now, Whether our faith or yours bee
the Catholique Primitiue faith: but the question now is
of the effect, to wit, the Visibility of your Church,
which you ought to prooue out of good Authors.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  May not a man prooue the effect
by the cause? Is there no other meanes to proue
the effect, but by naming men, and producing
Authors for it?
               
               
                  
                     M. Sweet.
                  An effect is posterius: the question
is about an effect: therefore you ought to proue it à posteriori.
                  
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  What a reason is this? May not an effect
be proued by his cause? Must an effect bee
needs proued by an effect? or à posteriori, because
an effect is posterius?
                  
               
               
                  
                     M. Sweet.
                  Leaue these Logick Disputes. Bring
the names of your Protestants: that is it we expect.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  If I should relinquish my former argument,
to which yet you haue giuen no manner
of answer, you, M. Fisher, would report that I
was non-plussed, as you slandered D. White in a
former conference, who (I tell you, M. Fisher) is
able to teach vs both. Whereto M. Fisher replied
nothing.
               
               To preuent all such mis-reports to the wrong
of either, it was mooued by the hearers, that it
should be written downe by the common Writer
of the Conference, that both the Disputants
beeing willing to proceed, D. Featly was desired
by the company (because it was late) to produce

the names of such Protestants as were extant
before Luther in all Ages. This beeing written
and subscribed by them both, D. Featly proceeded
to his Induction.
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  An induction is a forme of argument;
in which wee proceed from enumeration of
particulars, to conclude a generall, after this
manner:
                  It is so in this and this; et sic de eaeteris, and so
in the rest:
                  Therefore it is so in all.
                  According to this forme of arguing, thus I
dispute:
                  The Protestant Church was so visible, that the
names of those who taught and beleeued the
doctrine thereof, may bee produced in the first
hundred yeeres, and second, and third, and
fourth; et sic de caeteris, and so in the rest:
                  Therefore it was so in all Ages.
                  First, I name those of the first Age, and I begin
with Him, who is the beginning of all, our
Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, blessed for euer: at
whose name all knees must bow both in heauen
&amp; earth, and vnder the earth (at which words all
the company on both sides expressed an holy reuerence).
After Christ, I name the twelue Apostles,
and Saint Paul: and because there were few
Writers in the first Age (at least, whose vndoubted
works haue comne to our hands) I name onely
Ignatius after the twelue Apostles, and Saint
Paul; yet not denying, but that many others may
be named.
               
               
                  
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  These are enow for the first Age;
Christ, the twelue Apostles, Saint Paul and Ignatitius.
                  
               
               Heere, at the name of Ignatius, some of M. Fishers
side seemed very glad and confident, saying,
We are sure enough, Saint Ignatius is on our side.
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  I meane not the new Ignatius Loyola,
but Ignatius the Martyr: betweene whom there
is more difference in quality, then distance in
time.
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  Name of all the Ages, or else you do nothing.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  I cannot name all at once: will
you haue mee name men of so many Ages with
one breath? Will you haue mee eat my whole
dinner at a bit? Can I name twelue seuerally,
but I must name first one, then two, then three,
and so forward? I name (as I said before) in the
first Age, for our Religion, our blessed Lord and
Sauiour, the Founder of all Religion, the twelue
Apostles, and after them Saint Paul, and Ignatius
the Martyr. For the second Age, I name Iustin
Martyr,Saint Cyprian was heere mentioned, but intended for the first of the third Age. Clemens Alexandrinus, and Saint Irenaeus,
and I beginne first with Christ and his Apostles.
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  You shall not beginne with Christ and
his Apostles.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  You are not to make my Induction:
I will begin with Christ and his Apostles, where
I should begin, but in the first Age, and with the
first of it: shall I make a Catalogue of the Christian
Church, according to the seuerall Ages,

and leaue out Christ and his Apostles in the first
Age? Answer first to them, and I will proceed
to others.
               
               
                  M. Fisher.
                  Name the rest in all Ages, and then I
will answer you.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  First, answer to the first Age, and
then I will proceed to the second. If you grant
mee the first Age, then I will proceed presently
to the second; otherwise I must stay in the first.
               
               
                  M. Fisher.
                  Vnlesse you giue mee a Catalogue of
names throughout all Ages, I will not answer.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  Will you not answer Christ and his
Apostles in the first place?
               
               
                  M. Fisher.
                  I will not, before you haue named the
rest.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  Will you not bee tryed by Christ
and his Apostles?
                  That which Christ and his Apostles taught
in the first Age, was taught by succeeding Christians
in all Ages▪ this is confessed on both sides.
                  But the doctrine of the Protestants was taught
by Christ and his Apostles in the first Age▪
                  
                  Therefore the doctrine of the Protestants was
taught in all Ages.
                  Answer this Syllogisme, if you will not answer
my former induction.
               
               
                  M. Fisher.
                  I will not answer you any thing, till
you haue made your Catalogue.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  M. Fisher, I charge you, as you will
answer it before Christ himselfe at the dreadfull
day of Iudgement, answer now, vpon your conscience,

before all this Company, whether you
beleeue, that Christ and his Apostles taught our
faith or yours: this is the maine point of all: answer
directly to my Induction.
                  Notwithstanding this deepe charge, M. Fisher
still refused to answer to the argument of instance
in Christ and his Apostles: whereupon diuers,
expressing their distaste at such refusall, desired
D. Featly to surcease; telling him, that hee
ought not to talk any longer with such a one,
who refused to answer Christ and his Apostles.
And so the conference brake vp, hauing lasted about
foure houres.
               
            
            
               Additions to the former
Conference.
               IF any man maruell, that in so many houres
spent in the Conference, so few arguments
were discust, or rather, not any one throughly
vntwisted to the end, as the Opponent desired,
the cause hereof was, the Iesuites diffusiue &amp; discursiue
answers, but especially his dilatory cautions
and tergiuersations, who would not suffer
the Opponent to proceed in his argument, without
dictating it first to the common Writer of

the conference; and then, reading it, and setting
his hand thereto: which after hee had done, the
principall Respondent, M. Fisher, meditates by
himself an Answer; which hee first writeth in a
priuate paper, then sheweth it to his Assistant, M.
Sweet, and two other that stood by: according
to whose aduice he addeth, blotteth out, and altereth
what they thought fit. After this, he dictateth
it out of his priuate paper to the common
Writer of the conference; then resumes this
schedule from him, and, hauing compar'd it with
his priuate paper, subscribes it as a Record, and
then reads it openly. This long spinning, wreathing
and winding, he vsed to euery Syllogisme:
which was so tedious and irksome to the Auditory,
that a Protestant Diuine standing by, vpbraided
him in this manner: M. Fisher, what haue
wee deserued of you, that you should thus torment
vs, to make vs stay half an houre for an Answer
to euery Syllogisme and Prosyllogisme?
               The Lord of Warwick also more than once called
vpon M. Fisher to come to the point, to answer
briefly and directly, without discourses or vn
                     ••
                  
                  cessary
distinctions. A short lesson may be long
in playing; where ther are more rests than notes,
as it was heer. Yet all that passed in the conference,
is not particularly &amp; punctually set down.
Some things were omitted: which omissions because
the Author complaineth of, wee thought
fit heer to supply.
               1. About the entry into the conference, M.

                  Fisher offred a paper to bee read: part whereof
was read by D. Featly; the rest he refused to read,
saying, M. Fisher, lis contestata est, wee are already
agreed vpon the Question: we haue receiued the
Tenet vnder your owne hand, and are prepared to
oppose it: it is no time now to tie your Opponent
to new conditions.
               2. About the propounding the first Argument,
when M. Fisher carped at the word eternall;
D. White, to try &amp; winde M. Fisher, did cast a Syllogisme

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , to prooue the eternity of faith
from the eternity of the cause, the diuine predestination.
Whereunto when M. Fisher, or some standing
by, answered, that in that sense all other
things might be said to be eternall; another Protestant
standing by added, that faith might bee
said to be eternall, in that sense in which eternall
is taken, for e
                        •
                     iternall: so the soules of men are
said to be eternal, because though they had a beginning,
yet they shall haue no end. Neither so,
said M. Fisher, may faith be said eternall, because
the Apostle saith, Faith ceaseth. These Answers
and Replies vpon the By, wee omitted, because
D. Featly sufficiently expressed his minde by the
Synonymie, which he added to eternall, to wit, perpetuall:
and besides, the disputation was not of
the habit or infused grace of faith, which, Saint
Paul saith, ceaseth, but of the obiect or doctrine of
faith, which is eternall in that sense, in which S.
Iohn calleth the Gospell eternall, Reu. 14. 6. 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  .
I saw an Angell fleeing in the midst of heauen,

hauing the eternall Gospell.
               
               3. About the middle of the conference, D.
Featly took occasion, by the Iesuites often inculcating
and ingeminating the same Answer, to tax
their battologie or vain repetitions in their Iesus
Psalter, and other Books of Praiers; saying, M.
Fisher, I think, you partly beleeue, that the often
repeating the same Answer, addeth truth and
strength to your Answer; as you are perswaded,
that the saying-ouer the same Praiers, and repeating
the name Iesu so many times by tale, addeth
merit to the Praiers.
               
                  
                     M. Sweet.
                  What fault can you finde with the often
repeating the name Iesu? Doth not the holy Ghost in the
Scripture diuers times reiterate the Attribute Holy,
saying, Sanctus, sanctus, sanctus?
                  
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  Is there no difference between the
repeating the word Holy or Sanctus three times,
and repeating the name Iesus thirty times at the
least? nay, saith a Protestant standing by, a hundred
and thirty times?
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  In one of Dauid's Psalms, these words,
for his mercy endureth for euer, are repeated in euery
verse.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  It is true: these words, for his mercie
endureth for euer, are elegantly and sweetly repeated,
as the burden of that heauenly Song: but
note withall, M. Fisher, that something commeth
betwixt, and that this Epiphonema or clause is applied
in euery verse to a seuerall blessing of God
there remembred: what is this to the saying continuately,

                     Iesu, Iesu, Iesu, forty times in a breath.
If this be not the vain repetition or babbling forbidden
in praier by our Sauiour, Mat. 6. 7. I know
not what it is.
               
               
                  
                     M. Sweet.
                  It matters not. You are no lawfull Interpreter
of Scripture.
                  To which words as D. Featly was making a reply,
hee was recalled by the company, to prosecute
his main Argument.
                  Heer you may obserue by the way, that M. Fisher
saw well enough, that M. Sweets instance of
the thrice repeating the name Sanctus, was very
friuolous, and impertinently brought to maintain
their vain repeating the name Iesu, so many
score of times together in their Psalter: and therfore
hee let M. Sweet shift for himself, and make
good his instance, if he were able: for, M. Fisher
could not be ignorant, that the Fathers generally
obserue, against the Arrians, the mystery of the
Trinity of Persons to be implied in the thrice repeating
the word Sanctus.
                     Isa. 6. If the Papists repeat
the name Iesu to the like purpose (as they must
doo,Apoc. 4. if they take that for their pattern), will it
not follow, that forty times repeating the name
Iesus, implies, that there are forty Persons in Iesu?
So well did M. Sweet keep his owne pretended
law, that none should speak any thing but to the
purpose: but, because hee challenged to haue
made such a law himself, peraduēture he thought,
he might dispense with it.
                  4. In the prosecution of the mayne Argument,

when Master Fisher, being required to
giue a direct and punctuall answer to some proposition
in the Syllogisme, digressed from the
point, and discoursed, how an ignorant and vnlearned
man might first come to the knowledge
of the true Church, and was checked by Doctor
Featly, saying, This is not now to the purpose: M.
Chamberlane sitting by, added, The lesse to the purpose,
the better. Would you haue Master Fisher speake
to the purpose?
                  
                  5. In making way to the Induction, when D.
Featly was recalled, by a new Answer of Master
Fishers, to some former Argument which Doctor
Featly went about to refell, the Earle of Warwick
aduised him, notwithstanding this interruption,
to proceed to his induction; saying, Master Fisher,
like a woman, will haue the last word, but it makes no
matter; let him answer what hee will; wee presume,
his answers will bee but like his former.
                  
                  
                     6. In propounding an Argument by an induction,
after this manner: For the first age, I alledge
for Teachers of the Protestants Doctrine, Christ,
his twelue Apostles, Saint Paul, and Ignatius; for
the secondage, Iustine Martyr, &amp;c.
                  
               
               
                  M. Fisher,
                  
                  after hee had repeated the instance
in the first age in these words: In the first age you
alledge Christ, his twelue Apostles, Saint Paul, and Ignatius,
hee added Transeat: name in the succeeding
ages.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  You grant then, Christ and his
Apostles were Protestants.
               
               
                  
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  Will you slander me to my face? What
will you do
                        •
                      behinde my back?
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  I slander you not. The word transeat,
implies, in my vnderstanding, a concession; if
not, then deny it, and I will presently proue it.
                  But as for this word transeat, though that wee
made a transeat of it, and let it passe in our relation,
yet his owne side haue taken speciall notice
of it: and indeed Master Fisher Lupum auribus tenet.
If by transeat, he meant a concession or grant
of the proposition, wee desire no more of him:
if wee haue Christ and his Apostles on our side,
what neede wee more? To auoyde this inconue
                     
                        •
                     ience,
if hee interpret this transeat, Let it passe,
as not worthy of his Answere or notice; thus to
slighten an Argument drawne from His authority
(whose words shall not passe, though heauen
and earth passe) it cannot receiue a good construction.
But wee spare Master Fisher, quia vapulat
intus in poscenio, because hee hath bin schooled at
home. Forsooth this
Non bene crede mihi faciunt duo: Sufficit vnus.
                  
                  Surely many, that hold Master Fisher to bee a
great Gamaliel in the Romish Synagogue, very
much maruell, that being so often prest and vrged,
yea, and adiured also, hee should yet still
decline to make any Answer at all to the Opponents
instance in Christ and his Apostles. But, the
truth is, he and his companions are of the b
                        •
                     ood
of those, whom Tertullian fitly tearmeth Lucifugas
Scripturarum, 
                           ••
                        unners of the light. Like Bats,

they keep a fluttering in the twi-light of supposed
humane authorities, and plausible glosses of
reason, but the broad day-light of Scripture they
cannot endure. Though in his Question he laid
claime to all ages, in which any Scholler, according
to common sense and naturall apprehension,
would vnderstand, that hee meant Methodically
to begin at the first age, and thence prepetua
serie to descend to the later, as do the framers of
their owne late extant Catalogues of Romane
professors, beginning with Christ Iesus, Saint
Peter, Saint Paul, Corinthians, Ephesians, Thessalonians,
&amp;c. ordine naturae et temporum, yet hee
preposterously would haue the Opponents begin
first with the last age, and so ascend vpwards.
Omnia naturae contraria legibus ibunt; that so hee
might the better lurke in the darke and muddy
age next before Luther. Which the Opponent iustly
suspecting, resolued to hold to the high way
and fayre tracke of naturall method, intending
thereby to draw him into the cleare streame of
Antiquity, beginning at the fountaine in the first
age. But this, Master Fisher would by no meanes
indure, hoping, that hee might lye hid (tanquam
Sepia in atramento suo, like the Scuttle-fish in her
owne inke) in those darke ages next or neere
before Luther: whereas being beaten vp into
the cleerer streame of the first ages, hee would
easily bee discerned, and soone caught.
                  7. At the breaking vp of the Conference,
when Master Fisher desired to haue in his owne

custody the common Schedule (in which the
principall Arguments and Answers of the Disputants
were written by the common Notarie,
chosen by both parties, and subscribed by their
owne hands) Doctor Featly withstood this motion,
saying, Master Fisher, you are not a fit man
to bee trusted with this Authenticall writing: for,
in a former conference betweene me and Master
Musket (whose Assistant you then were) you
tooke vpon you, (without any commission
frō me, or consent) the office of a Notarie, to take
my Answeres: and being vpon occasion pressed
by the company to read what you had written,
after some tergiuersations you read it, and
thereupon were checked by the whole company,
for setting that downe for my Answeres,
which was neuer spoken by mee, nor any thing
like vnto it: and that I charge you truly with
this vndue dealing, I appeale to some heer present,
viz. Doctor Goad and Master Wats▪
                      who
were present at that conference. Heer Doctor
Goad and Master Wats affirmed to Master Fishers
face, that vpon their knowledge, Master Fisher
was conuicted of vntrue setting downe Doctor
Featlyes Answers in that conference; and that
vpon such conuiction, Master Fisher was forced
to correct what hee had formerly set downe.
               
               Heerto Master Fisher, much moued at such
imputation, answered:
               
                  M. Fisher.
                  
                  I call God to witnesse, that if I did
set downe any thing otherwise then the truth wa
                        •
                     ,

I did it not wittingly nor willingly.
               
               Whereunto Doctor Goad replied,
               D. Goad. Whether you did it wittingly or
willingly, bee it betweene God and your conscience:
sure wee are, that what you wrote down
vntruly, was aduantageous to your owne side;
and therefore wee had iust cause to suspect, that
you did it wittingly and willingly.
            
            
               An Attestation concerning some
particulars, set downe in a Relation entituled,
The Fisher catched in his
owne Net.
               VVHereas the Relation of that
which passed in the Conference
touching the Visibility of the
Church, Iune 27. 1623. is in the whole course of
it truely and indifferently deliuered, and rather
moderately and fauourably carried, in regard of
the Aduersary respondent, Master Fisher, whose
part, in respect of his delayes and euasions, was
not altogether so tolerably acted, as in the sayd
briefe Relation it is represented: wee hold it
needlesse to giue thereunto any other generall
Attestation; especially considering, that the principall
Heads thereof are extant vnder the hands

of both parties; and the chief substance and current
thereof, for ought wee finde, is not reiected
by the Aduersarie. Yet because a Counter-relator,
calling himselfe A. C. hath of late put forth
in print an answer to the sayd Relation, and therin
(not content to slighten and doubt of some
passages) hath by expresse deniall excepted against
diuers other particulars, so charging the
Protestant Relator with crimen falsi: wee, who
were present at the said Conference, and attentiue
vnto it, could not in equity and conscience
bee wanting to the support of truth, by our
ioynt Testimony heere following.
               1. The Counter-relator auoucheth,Pag. 15. that There,
(viz. in the beginning,) and not in the end of the
Disputation, Doctor Featly did say, I wish, I warne, I
command, I coniure you, &amp;c. Heerein wee finde a
double falsification. The first, by deniall of that
which, to our perfect remembrance, was by D.
Featly spoken to Master Fisher in the end of the
disputation; when Master Fisher, hauing bin often
vrged to answer the Instance in Christ and his
Apostles in the first Age, yet peremptorily refused.
Whereupon, Doctor Featly, with a lowd
and earnest voice, said vnto him: I charge and
adiure you, as you will answer it before Christ himselfe
at the day of Iudgement, answer now vpon your conscience,
Whether you beleeue that Christ &amp; his Apostles
taught our faith or yours? The second falshood
is, by adding and peruerting that which was
said in the beginning of the disputation by D.

                  Featly, without any mention of the day of Iudgement,
or coniuring, much lesse commanding; which
had bin vnciuill. All that hee then said to such
purpose, was this: I desire you, Master Fisher, to
answer in this disputation to my Arguments directly
and sincerely, as in the sight of God. Which condition
Master Fisher did then accept, and required the
like dealing from Doctor Featly.
               
               2. In the same page is added a second Lawe,Pag. 15.
as enacted by Master Sweet, that Nothing should
bee spoken or heard, but to the purpose. Which rule
(though requirable &amp; seasonable in all Disputes
or Tractates), yet was not mentioned by Master
Sweet, nor prescribed by any other in this Conference.
The second then-mentioned Rule was,
as is set downe in the first Printed Relation, that
None should speake but the Disputants. Vpon which,
diuers of the Protestant side, both Diuines and
others, did forbeare to interpose by way of Argument.
               3. This Co
                     •
                  nter-relator is so bold,Pag. 16. as flatly to
deny that which vpon our certaine knowledge
wee testify; Namely, that to the points of Popery
instanced by Doctor Featly as nouelties,
Master Sweet (interrupting him, before hee had
recited all of them) answered, These are scholasticall
points, not fundamentall; And secondly, that
heereupon Doctor White forthwith replyed
with this Argument: These points are defined
in your Councell of Trent; therefore they are to
you fundamentall; adding also expresly this
Syllogisme:
               
                  
Whatsoeuer denied makes a man an Heretick,
is fundamentall.
               But the deniall of any of these, makes a man
an Heretick with you:
               
                  Ergo euery one of these is to you fundamental.
               To which Syllogisme, beeing aloud and distinctly
vttered by D. White, nothing at all was answered.
               4. With the same boldnes,Page 16. in the same page
it is denied, that D. Featly vsed these words, Name
but one Father, one Writer of note, who held the Particulars
there named (being points of Popery) for
fiue hundred yeers after Christ. Which words were
vttered by him distinctly and audibly, and (as it
seemed to vs) out of certaine Notes in a paper
which he then had before him.
               5. Item,
                  Page 20. howsoeuer M. Fisher might (as it seemeth
he now interpreteth himselfe) mean quoad
nos, when he said, that A demonstration à posteriori
is better than à priori, yet in the disputation he
spake those words absolutely, and without limitation.
For which words so absolutely deliuered,
M. Fisher being then taxed by M. Ailesbury,
                  Page 32. as defectiue
in Academicall learning; M. Boulton, a
Romanist, with indignation replied vpon M.
Ailesbury in this manner: Think you your self better
learned, than M. Fisher? Whereto the other presently
made Answer, I thought you wiser, than to
ask me such a Question.
               
               6. Item, though they in generall tearms deny
D. White to haue spoken in the manner set down,

or to haue vsed any such long discourse, yet wee
very well remember, that D. White did then vpbraid
the said Iesuites with those their apparent
tergiuersations, and hindring the Opponent
from proceeding in his Arguments; thereupon
also requiring M. Fisher, according to the order
set down and assented vnto by themselues, at
length to oppose; the prefixed time, for D. Featlie's
opposing, beeing passed. And then D. White
naming his owne propositions (mentioned in the
Relation), offered forthwith to Answer vpon the
same directly, without any delayes or tergiuersations.
               7. To M. Fishers protestation,Page 36. that he did not
wittingly nor willingly write amisse (in a former
Conference betweene M. Musket and D. Featly),
the Popish Relator saith, that nothing was replyed;
and thereupon inferreth, that the Audience was
well satisfied of M. Fishers sincerity, in his relation and
writing of the former Disputation. But wee perfectly
remember, that thereunto D. Goad presently replied
in this manner: M. Fisher, Whether you did
it wittingly and willingly, be it betweene God and your
conscience: I am sure you erred on that part which was
aduantageous for your owne side. Vpon which Reply
(no further Answer beeing giuen), we were
and are so farre from beeing satisfied of this Iesuites
sincerity, that wee rather suspect him the
more.
               In this sort when the Company was willing to depart,Page 37.
D. Featly beeing called vpon (as it seemed) by some of

his companions, to goe away, did arise, and offer to bee
gone. Yet in his rising hee turned to M. Fisher; saying,
Will you dispute of Christ and his Apostles, or not? To
which M. Fisher sayd, I will, if you will stay; and,
stretching out his hand, took D. Featly by the arme,
offering to stay him: yet he in this abrupt manner went
away. Thus the Iesuites Relator.
               
               This passage being of most moment, and (as
wee think) the principall intent of setting foorth
this Counter-relation, to abate the imputation,
lying heauie vpon the Iesuite, for his finall refusing
to answer to Christ and his Apostles, wee
hold it fit, the more punctually to declare the
manner and cause of the breach of that Conference.
               True it is, that vpon the Iesuites often refusall
to answer to Christ and his Apostles, the Protestant
auditory took much distaste, and for a short
time expressed the same, by a kind of obmurmuration,
yet not by any shout of victory (as is exaggerated
by the Popish Relator). But after this noise
ceased, D. Featly stil continued, vrging the Iesuite
to answer his said instance: which the Iesuite peremptorily
refused, persisting to the end, in his
former denyall of answering Christ and his
Apostles. And as for the Iesuites, by word &amp; gesture
offring to answer Christ and his Apostles, if
D. Featly would stay; we (that were present, and
diuers of vs next to the Opponent) auow, that
the Iesuite vsed no such word at all, nor gesture
of that kinde: as in truth he could not, beeing

not so neere in place to D. Featly, as that he could
take him by the arme, they beeing placed distant
one from the other, at the opposite ends and
corners of the Table. Neither did M. Fisher arise
out of his place, to take D. Featly by the arme:
nor, if he had, could hee then come to reach D.
Featly, there beeing many that sate, or stood,
close crowding about the Table, and betwixt
those two.Page 64.
               
               
                  The truth of his finall and resolute denyall is
so euident, that the Popish Relator (whom wee
take to be M. Fisher himselfe, vnder the Mask of
A. C). howsoeuer in this place he stoutly denyeth
the said denyall; yet, contrary to the rule
of his owne Trade,
                  Page 65. Mendacem oportet esse memorem,
pag. 64. hee expresly acknowledgeth
it: M. Fisher and M. Sweet did very well to stand
as they did, constantly to it. They still kept the aduersary
to the point, and would not permit him to diuert,
eyther to dispute about Christ or his Apostles, or any
other point, vntill names were giuen in all Ages. And
pag. 65. hee bindeth it with a reason, taken from
the principles of Hunting: The reason therefore
why M. Fisher might well refuse to enter into such
particular Disputes, before full Induction of names were
ended was, for that this had bin to follow two Hares at
once, and so to catch neither, &amp;c.
               Lastly, as for taking D. Featly by the arme
(pretended to be done by M. Fisher, for the staying
him to proceed in his proposed instance) true
it is, that when he had againe and againe inculcated

this challenge, and could receiue no answer of
acceptation, hee was taken by the Arme, not to
stay him, but to pull him away; not by the Iesuite,
but by two of his owne side; the one wishing him
to depart, for that the time was farre spent, and he
could not come off vpon better tearmes; theNamely, M. Chamberlain.
                   other
adding also, that himselfe could not endure
to bee an hearer any longer of such a Dispute,
where Christ and his Apostles are refused; and
that he (D. Featly) ought not to talk any longer
with such an one, who refused to answer Christ
and his Apostles. And so, the Opponent beeing
called off, or rather pulled off, the Conference
brake vp.
               These aboue-testified particulars, beeing so
vndoubtedly knowne, and perfectly remembred
by vs, and many others; wee cannot conceiue
how the Iesuite can possibly salue those his
grosse denyals of them, but by the new subtile
deuice of refining a lye by Equiuocation, and
calcining any speech of their own, though neuer
so base and drossy a fiction, in the forging furnace
of mentall reseruation.

            A
REMONSTRANCE
sent in a letter, by Doctor Featly,
to his worthy Friend Sir Humfrey
Lynde, touching the former conference
held at his house, Iune 27.
1623.
            
               
                  PLiny writeth of one of the Roman
Emperours,Natural. hist. l. 36. c. 5. that he vsed
to behold the Fensers (playing
their prizes before him) in
the reflection of an Emerald:
               Gladiatorum pugnas spectabat Smaraegdo. which so refreshed
his eye with the verdure thereof,
that though the Obiect were not very
acceptable alwaies, and pleasing to him;
yet the viewing it in that precious reflecting
Gemme was very delightfull. Such
a precious Emerald is the heart &amp; affection

on of a true friend, which represents,
with delight and content, those things
concerning our selues and others, which
otherwise of themselues may bee irksome
and grieuous vnto vs. I must confesse,
your Letter touching our conference
at your house, had many Pils
wrapt vp in it: yet were they so sugred
with your loue, and gilded with your eloquence,
that I easily and pleasantly swallowed
them down. 
                  It grieueth you much,
that our pains in the conference (which took

Army. But it falleth out contrary, say you;
in this encounter. In which though the truth
lost nothing, but gained him, whose satisfaction
was by it intended, &amp; strengthened
also many others; yet you adde, that you
find some of our profession more ready to
except against, then approve the proceedings
in this combat.

Their exceptions lie either against
conferences in generall in point of

Religion, of which belike they say, They
neuer saw any good come; or against the passages
of this Conference in particular.
            For Conferences in generall with the
Aduersaries of our faith, either to conuert
them to the Truth, or conuince them
with the Truth, wee haue not onely frequent

proclaimed an harlot, and all her children

yet would not this excuse our neglect of

vnexcusable. And what if wee doo not
winne them, yet wee confirme both our

conduce to some good end; to speake
nothing of the Conference at Hampton-Court,

receiued their smartest blowe by disputation.

But, in a Conference orderly carried, the
force of euery Argument, and sufficiency
of euery Answer, is brought to the Test;
and Truth and Error, by grappling together,
try their vtmost strength. As, by smiting

               Ludouicus Viues
long ago obserued, that the true faith and
Religion is like gold, which is bettred by
the hammer: but false religion, Heresie
and superstition, are like Alchumy-stuffe,
or glasse, which cannot endure the
stroke, but are battered in pieces by it.
The Christian Religion neuer refuseth
touch of argument: but the Gentiles of
old, and the Mahumetans at this day, refuse
all triall by disputation; nay, they
prohibit it vnder paine of death.
            The Hussites, as Cocleus relates in their
storie, were readie to bid their Aduersaries
battell by disputation, but their Aduersaries
were not so readie to vndertake
them. Nay,

               Iohn Gerson, in his Epistle to
the Arch-bishop of Prague, is so far from
encouraging him to put the matter to a
triall in disputation, that he aduiseth him
to take a farre different course with
them, whom he there falsly calls Pseudo-doctores,
false teachers. Now, saith he, The
onely readie way to cut downe Heresies,

is by the temporall sword. Miracles are
ceased; neither is it lawfull now to tempt
God, to confirme our faith, tanquam nouellam,
by Miracles. Neque rursus in disputando

Neither will there bee any end of disputing
with such pertinacious contenders,
who rely vpon their owne wisdome:
nay rather, according to the words of
Seneca, the truth will bee lost with much
wrangling: the people will bee scandalized;
charity woūded; in a word, the proteruitie
of obstinate persons will make
good that of the Poet, The wound is the
worse for the cure. So little did the Papists
gaine (whatsoeuer faire glosse Gerson
puts vpon it) by disputation with those
noble Fore-runners of our Protestant
Faith: and far lesse haue there successours

gained by their disputations in Germany,
France and England. I need adde no more
to our disputers against disputations in
generall, because they fight but aloof off.
I am now to buckle with those who take
the matter &amp; manner of this conference
to task: against which, as I vnderstand
by you, they obiect, that it was but a
Flourish, no Fight; a praeludium, and no
true Encounter; no Argument in it prosecuted
to the full. This obiection might
haue been spared, because in the Conference
it self it is confessed, that it grew
not to that maturity, nor attained that
progresse or issue which was desired: and
there also it is expressed, whose fault it
was. If a heauy and dull Beast, in rich
trappings and furniture, making great
shew of metall by rising and curuetting,
yet, beeing spurred and lashed by the Rider,
and beaten by all the standers by, wil
not mend his pase, what disparagement
is this to the Rider?
            Howsoeuer, say they, the grapes being
not ripe, were not fit for the presse; yet as
vnripe as they were, they quenched then

his thirst for whom they were gathered:
and they, who, without knowledge of
the principal Owners, put them in a few
weeks so often in the presse, affirme, that
the wineQui me vendit Bibliopola negat. Martial. Epigr. lyes not vpon their hand. Notwithstanding
this and some other testimonies,
of some kind of approbation of
this rather assay, then performance, I had
buried this Embryo as soone as it was
borne: and as it came into the world
without a Midwife; so it should
haue gone out of the world without
a Bel-man, had not the slanderous
tongues of enemies saued the life of
it: who, both in England and beyond
the seas, reported confidently, that it
was such a mis-shapen and deformed
monster, that the parents were ashamed
it should see the Sunne. To checke these
most false and iniurious reports, and preuent
future scandall, it was in a manner
necessarie, that this pamphlet should bee
suffered to fly abroad. And now that it is
abroad, what doe they libell against this
little Impe, vnable to defend it self against
such strife of tongues? They say, In it the

proofes are diuersiue, and that I decline
the method required by Master Fisher,
plainely to proue the visibilitie of our
Church, by producing Catalogues of
names in al ages, beginning from Luther;
and so, ascending vpwards to Christ and
his Apostles. When I read this obiection
in your letter, I could scarce forbeare
laughing, because it brought to my remembrance
the simple Answer of a
fresh-water souldiour; who, when his
Antagonist remembred him with a
smart blowe or two vpon his head and
thighes, exclaimed, What, man? Canst
thou not see my buckler? Is not my buckler
broad enough? I saw M. Fishers buckler,
and withall I obserued his blind sides, at
which I laid. Am I therefore to bee blamed?
should I aduise him, as Aiax doth

                     que
                   late, et mecum contende
sub illo. Lie behinde thy buckler, and
contend with me vnder it? The truth is,
that in the ages immediately before Luther,
and since theApoc. 20. 2. 1000 yeer, in which
Satan was let loose, the Papists haue
much to say for the visibility, yea and

pomp too of their degenerating Church:
but in the Primitiue tymes, especially in
the golden Age, in which Christ and his
Apostles, and their immediate successors
and Scholars liued and died, they haue no
more to say for the visibilitie of their
now new Romish Church, then Master
Fisher and Master Sweet said in the conference.
Whosoeuer should haue discoursed
in those dayes, of Masses without
Communicants, or Communion without
the Cup, or the Lords Supper without
Bread or Wine in substance, or prayers
without vnderstanding, or adoring
the Cross, or Dirges for the dead, or blessing
Salt and Spettle, or censing Images,
or baptizing bells, or hallowing grains
and medals, or wearing Agnus Dei's, or
praying by tale vpon Beads, or of the
circumgestation of the Hoast, or Priest
shauen crownes, or Monks Cowles, or
Cardinals Hatts, or the Popes 
                  •

Crowne, or his pardons, and dispensations,

                deposing Kings,
or the like; would haue been thought besides
himselfe.
            
               
This is the true cause why, the question
being propounded, Of all ages before Luther,
I chose rather to descend frō Christ
to Luther, then ascend frō 
               Luther to Christ
and his Apostles. Demosthenes
               Orat. de Corona. will by no
meanes endure, that his aduersarie Aeschines
should prescribe him his method:
he saith, It is against the golden rule, to be
kept in all iudgements, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               .
Yea, but they say, this is not all: for, you
turned quite out of the way: You should
haue proued one thing, and you proued
another. The question was of the visibilitie
of Church: but your arguments were
of the eternity of faith. Is not this thiug
adEras. Adag.
                   Choū; Ego respondeo de allijs: tu disputas
de cepis: M. Fisher answered of Garlike,
&amp; you spake of Onions. For this vnsauory
exception, M. Sweet was sauced in the
conference: where it was proued against
him, that to proue an effect by the cause,
is a direct &amp; naturall, and not a diuersiue
proofe. My argument standeth thus:
            The true Primitiue faith, once giuen
to the Saints, hath had, must, and shall
haue alwaies visible Professors thereof.
            
               
But the faith of the Protestant Church
is the true Primitiue faith, once giuen to
the Saints:
            Therefore the Protestant faith hath
had, and shall haue alwaies visible Professors
thereof.
            The Maior is euident in Scripture, and
confessed on all hands. The Minor I offered
to proue: but the Iesuites durst not
stand to their deniall. The Maior and Minor
passing without controll, none but
Master Fisher would haue denied or distinguished
vpon the conclusion. This
argument I affirme not onely direct, to
proue the conclusion denied; but also
most pertinent to the maine scope of the
question, which is, to finde out the true
Church: whereof there can be no sound
and infallible proofe, but out of Scripture.
And for the visibility of the true
Church, either it is a matter of faith, or
not. If not, what need wee so much trouble
our selues with it? If it bee matter of
faith,De praescr. contr. Haeret. c. 16. 
               Aliunde scilicet possunt suadere de rebus
fidei, nisi ex literis fidei? can they otherwise
perswade in matter of faith, then

out of the Writ of faith, that is, the holy
Scripture? For humane Stories and Records
in al ages, they are not easily found:
and when we haue found them, we find
them so defectiue, so corrupted and defaced,
and oftentimes so contrary one to
another, that they scarce beget humane
faith subiect to errour. And were they neuer
so perfect, as Bellar. confesseth, they
could not beget
                  Bellar. l. 2. de effect. Sacram. c. 25. quod Histories quibus meminerint eorum Conciliorum, non potest parere fidem nisi humanam, cui potest subesse falsa. diuine and infallible
faith. If no man can bee saued, without
knowledge that he is in the true Church:
and no man can knowe, that he is in the
true Church, vnless hee can proue out
of good Authours, the perpetuall succession
and visibility of the Church
to which hee adhereth, as Iesuites make
their breake-neck climax or gradation;
what shall become of many millions of
Christians in their owne Church, who
neither haue time, nor meanes, nor learning,
to search all Records of Antiquitie?
Could all Lay Papists produce Writers in
all Ages, who maintained the present
Tridentine faith (which none yet of the
their learned Clerks euer did, or could,)

yet they are little neerer: For Iewes and
Paynims, and it may bee, diuers sorts of
Hereticks can proue too many visible
professors of their Heresies and impieties
in all ages, since Christ and his Apostles
times, and some before. From visibility
of Professors no man can certainely conclude
truth of sauing Doctrine conformable
to Scriptures: but from conformity
of Doctrine to the scriptures, a man
may by infallible consequence, grounded
vpon Gods promises to his Church, conclude
perpetuall visibility of professors,
more or lesse. And therefore the course I
tooke, is not onely the streight, but the
easiest and onely certaine way to bring vs
to the true Church, which is the1 Tim. 3. 15 
               house of
the liuing God, the pillar and ground of truth.
Thus much for proofe of my proofe by
syllogism. I wil now giue you an account
of my Catalogue, and shew my inducements
to my induction. Against which,
I heare by you, it is excepted, that in vndertaking
it, I leaue the beaten way, and
take a way by my self, where I shall surely
lose my selfe, &amp; neuer come to an end.

To this obiection, the ciuil Law furnisheth
me with an Answer: Nemo tenetur
diuinare; No man is bound to prophecie
before-hand, especially of the successe of
anothers labours. If leaue be procured for
a second Meeting, the golden thread of
succession, which I tooke hold of from
Christs blessed hand, and his Apostles,
shall be drawne downe (God willing) to
later Ages, euen to Luthers time. But what
they meane by holding the beaten way,
I cannot easily diuine. If they mean, that I
ought to proue the visibility of the Protestant
Church, by hauing recourse meerely
to the corrupt Popish Church, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

               Hercynian Forest, when
they are at a stand, obserue certaine birds
fleeing before them; and, by the brightnes
of their white feathers shining in the
dark, guide their steppes, and finde out a
way: so, in vshering the Witnesses of
Truth throughout all Ages, when in the
darker times mine owne obseruations
shall faile mee, I doubt not, but, by the
bright wings of those auspicate birds that
haue flowne before me, I mean the light▪
of their siluer quils who haue wrote of
this Subject, to finde out my way.
            I haue omitted nothing that hath been
materially excepted against the Conference,

except an omission of the s

the question; which they say is not so
perspicuously and dilucidly deliuered, as
they could wish. That which is set down
to this purpose in the entry into the Conference,
they say is so brief, that,

lightning, which rather scares, than lights
the Passenger in his way. If this were a
iust exception, yet it lyeth not against me,
who had the Opponents part put vpon
me, but against M. Fisher, who be-spoke
himselfe to be Respondent. For, by the
orders of all Schools, it is the Answerers,
and not the Opponents task, to state the
Question. He that keeps a Fort in battel,
is to make his ramparts, and guard the
walls with redouts and out-works: the
assailants part is to lay well his batteries,
and make breaches where he can.
            At the next desired meeting, when D.
White or my selfe should haue supplyed
the Respondents place, the Question
should haue been explicated to the full
(by the distinctions &amp; conclusions heerin
inclosed). But, as that Meeting, by iniurious

suggestions, was then, so I feare, all
future Meetings in this kinde will bee
stopped by the same Engine. The Informers,

            Touching the Visibility of the
CHVRCH.
            The Questions propounded by the Iesuite,
were,
            1 WHether the Protestant Church was
in all Ages visible?
            2 Whether visible Protestants are to
be named in all Ages, &amp;c?
            
               To the first question, I answer: This question,
as all other, will be best explicated
               
                  by

                        Distinctions of the tearmes.
                        Conclusions or Assertions vpon the
distinctions.
                     
                  
               
               The tearms to be distinguished of, are three.

                     The subiect, A Church.
                     
                     The denomination, Protestant.
                     
                     The attribute, Visible.
                     
                  
               
               
                  Of the tearm, Church.
                  
                     The first distinction.
                     The Church may be considered

                           Either in respect of election &amp; inward
sanctification;
                           Or in respect of outward vocation, and
profession of the truth.
                        
                     
                     In this question, wee consider the Church in

the latter respect, in which alone it is visible: for
although the elect, as they are men, and professe
the true faith, are visible; yet men professing
the true faith, as they are elect, and inwardly
sanctified and regenerated in their minds, are not
visible.
                  
                  
                     The second distinction.
                     A Church professing the Christian faith,
may be taken, either
                     More largely for a company of Professors
of the true faith, whether they be vnited vnder
one gouernment in one Countrey,
Kingdome or Empire, or scattered through
the whole world.
                     Or more strictly, for a company of professors
of the true faith, hauing actuall communion
one with the other, vnited vnder one
gouernment, within certain limits, secluded
and seuered from other societies and congregations.
As for example: The Reformed
Church in France, at this day is vnited
within it selfe, and seuered from the Popish
Church, and the members thereof:
among whom yet they liue, and ciuilly conuerse.
                     In this question, wee tie not our selues to
prooue a Protestant Church in all Ages, in the
latter sense. It sufficeth, that we shew it in the former,
and prooue, that there were alwaies those
who▪ maintained the doctrine which wee now

teach, whether they were vnited, or seuered, had
actuall communion one with another, or not;
kept publique assemblies by themselues apart,
from the Romane, and other Churches, or not:
For as Saint Austen sheweth
                           Aug. Contra Donatist. lib. 6. cap. 4. Idem Spiritus sanctus ea dimittit, qui datus est omnibus sanctis sibi charitate cohaerentibus, siue se nouerint corporaliter, siue non. against the Donatists,
The same Spirit of God is giuen to all Saints, who
are knit one to another in charity, whether they know one
another corporally or not.
                     
                  
               
               
                  Of the denomination Protestant.
                  
                     Distinction the first.
                     Protestants may be considered,
Either according to their name, taken from
at legall act of protesting either against the
Councell of Trent, or against the
                           D. Andrew, now Bishop of Winton, Resp. ad Apolog. Bellar. pag. 20. Protestantium nostris nomen ab euentu fuit: errores enim tū quosdam &amp; abusus non diutius tolerare velle se, sed 
                              •
                           am tollere protestati sunt; caetera vero quae sa
                              •
                           a vobiscum retinere. errors and
abuses of Poperie, when they grewe to their
ful measure, &amp; were most vnsufferable, about
the time that Luther beganne to oppose the
Church of Rome, or a little after; or from
the Protestation of the Bohemians, in the
yeere of our Lord 1421. set downe byCocl. lib. 5.
                         
                        Coclaeus,
in his L. 5. histor. of the Hussits:
                     Or according to their faith and doctrine,
positiuely comprised in, &amp; confined to scripture;
and oppositely, as it is repugnant to all
errors in faith, and manners, against the holy
Scriptures, especially against the present errors
of the Church of Rome.
                     
                     In this question, wee consider Protestants in
the later sense, not in the former. The name,
we confesse, of Protestants is not very antient, as

neither is the name of Papists, much lesse of Iesuites:
but the Doctrine of the Protestants wee
maintaine to be as antient as Christ and his Apostles:

                           Ignat. Epist. ad Philad.and we may truly say with Ignatius the Martyr,

                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        : Iesus Christ is my
antiquity. As the same piece of gold successiuely
passeth thorow diuers stampes and inscriptions:
so the self-same faith of Protestants, in substance,
hath passed thorow all Ages, yet with diuers
names; as of Becherits, Berengarians, Petrobrusians,
Henricians, Albingenses, Waldenses, Dulcinists, Lolards,
Luiddamites, Wickleuists, Hussites, Thaborits,
Lutherans, Hugonots, Gospellers and Reformers. The
faithfull, as wee read in the Acts,
                        Acts 11. 26. were first
called Christians at Antioch: yet were they indeed
Christians, euen from Adam, after the
promise was giuen, that theGen. 3. It shall break thy head. 
                        seed of the woman
should break the Serpents head. So, that although we
should grant toApolog. ad Reg. Ang. 
                        Bellarmine, that the name of Protestants
was not heard of, for 1500. yeeres after Christ,
yet would it not hence follow, but that the Protestants
faith might bee as antient as Christ and
his Apostles, yea, in a true sense, as Adam himselfe;
sith the Protestant faith is no other then
the pure Primitiue Christian faith.
                  
                  
                     Distinction the second.
                     Protestants in faith and doctrine are of two
sorts; either
                     Implicitely, and vertually: and such are all
those, who holding the Scripture for the

sole and entire rule of faith, condemn
consequently all doctrines of faith,
against or besides the holy Scriptures,
especially if they deliuer such
positions and doctrines, from whence
by necessary and infallible consequence,
some particular error or other
of the Romish Church (although
not perhaps sprung vp in
their time) may bee refelled.
                     Or explicitly, and actually: and
such are they, who directly &amp; professedly
opposed Romish errors as they
crept in, or not long after; especially
those who opposed the whole masse
of Popish errors and superstitions, after
they grew to a ripe sore, fit to bee
lanced, about the time of Luther.
                     
                     In this question, wee restraine not the name
Protestants, to those who renounce all the particular
errors of the present Romish church at this day:
for such Protestants could not bee much before
Luther. The particular diseases must in nature
bee presupposed, before a particular remedy can
bee applyed vnto them. Reformation necessarily
presupposeth a disorder, and deformation. Neither
doe wee restraine the name Protestants, to
such only as in particular set themselues directly
and professedly against some speciall error of
Popery, as of Transubstantiation, Purgatory, Indulgences,
&amp;c. for such professed opposing, could not

bee imagined, before such errors were in beeing.
But as the Fathers, before the Councell of Nice,
did not in words define 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , or that the Son
was of the same substance with the Father, and
not 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         onely, that is, of a like substance; nor
professedly wrote against the Heresie of Arius
by name:Homoousiani. yet are they rightly esteemed 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        
indeed, or maintainers of the right beliefe,
touching the consubstantiality of the Sonne to the
Father; because out of their Sentences and Writings
this truth may be deduced, howsoeuer it be
not formally expressed in the tearme of 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        :
So all those are to bee esteemed Protestants,
who, holding nothing against the protestant faith,
deliuer some doctrines, and positions, from
which some error of Popery or other may bee
cleerly refuted, whether such error were then
maintained by any in the Church of God, or no.
                  
               
               
                  Of the tearme Visible.
                  A Church may be said to be visible, two manner
of waies: either
                  Visible to the whole world, and that
eminently, and in some sort pompously, as
the Roman Empire, &amp; kingdom of Naples,
or respublica Venetorum:
                     
                        Bellar. l. 3. de Eccles. militante. c. 12. in which sense, the
Papists affirm, that the true Church ought
alwaies to bee visible: but wee denie it.
                  Or visible to all the members of that
Church, either such as God hath already
called, or such as he will call in time, who

by searching and due inquirie, may and
shall finde out the true Church their mother.
                  In this question, we vndertake not to prooue
a Protestant Church visible in all Ages, in the
first acception, but in the later onely, wee maintaine
a visible; but not a conspicuous, eminent,
and glorious face of a Church in all Ages, consisting
of an apparant Hierarchy, as the Papists
teach.
                  I shall not need to adde more distinctions for
the explication of this first question. I come
therefore briefly to the particular assertions, seruing
for the confirmation and illustration of the
generall and mayne conclusion, touching the
Visibility of the Protestant Church.
                  
                     The first assertion.
                     The Church, in the most strict and proper acception
thereof, is the whole company of Gods elect. Thus S.
Paul in the Epistle to the Hebrewes, describeth
her: TheHeb. 12. 23. generall assembly and Church of the first
borne, which are written in heauen. And Saint Gregory
vpon Ezechiel: There is one Church of the elect,
both going before, and following after. And againe vpon
the Canticles: Christ, according to the grace of his
foreknowledge, hath built a holy Church of Saints, which
shall eternally perseuer in grace. And Saint Bernard:

                           Greg. in Ezek.This is the Church of the Elect.Hom. 15. l. 2. Vna Ecclesia est electorum praecedentium at
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            sequentium. 
                        Of this
Church,
                              Greg. in Cant. Sanctam Ecclesiam, de sanctis in aeternum permansuris exstruxit. Saint Austen
                           Ber. ser. 68. in Cant. Haec est Ecclesia electorum. 
                        speaketh most expresly:
He shall neuer be withdrawne from that Church,
                           Aug. l. 20. de ciuit. Dei. c. 8. which

is predestinated and chosen before the foundations of
the world:Nunquam ab illa Ecclesia seduceturpraedestinatae, et electa ante constitutionem mundi. 
                        yet poore Iohn Hus, asIn his Catholick moderator. H. C. a zealous
Papist, rightly obserueth, was burnt, by the
decree of the Councell of Constance, for saying
no more in this point, then Saint Paul and Saint
Gregory said before him, viz.
                           Cocleus Hist. Bohem. l. 3. Catholica Ecclesia est
omnium praedestinatorum duntaxat: The Catholique
Church consists of all those that are predestinate, and
of them onely. But the best is, as our
                        Resp. ad Camp. Humfrey speaketh
pertinently: Combustus est, non confutatus
Hussius: Iohn Hus was indeed burned, but hee
was neuer confuted. His doctrine is written with
a poynt of a Diamond, neuer to bee razed out:
for, it is Gods truth: The foundation of God standeth
sure, hauing this seale, The Lord knoweth
them that are his. And so I fall into my second
assertion.
                     
                  
                  
                     The second assertion.
                     
                        The Church in this acception, as it consisteth of the
elect onely, is knowne to God onely, and consequently
is inuisible. This the Apostle2. Tim. 2. 29. teacheth: The
Lord knoweth them that are his: And the Spirit
intimateth as much in these words,Reu. 2. 17. 
                        I will giue
him a white stone, and in it a new name written, which
no man knoweth, sauing hee that receiueth it. For,
what man1. Cor. 2. 11. knoweth the things of a man, saue the spirit
of man which is in him? TheIer. 17. 9, 10. heart of man is deceitfull
aboue all things, who can knowe it? I the Lord
search the heart, I try the reines. This soueraigne

                        utest prayers; as Salomon:1. King. 8. 39. Thou
euen thou onely, knowest the hearts of all the children of
men. And Ieremie,Ier. 20. 12. Thou that triest the Righteous, and
seest the reines, and the heart. And the eleuen Apostles:
Acts 1. 24.
                        Thou Lord, which knowest the harts of all men
Now, if God onely knowe the heart, he onely
knowes who beleeue in him, and loue him in
sincerity of heart. Therefore let none, saith Saint

                           Cyp. l. 3. Ep. 3.
                        Cyprian,Nec quisquam sibi, quod soli filio tribuit Pater, vindicare se puter, vt ad aream ventilandam et purgandam paleam iam ferre se posse, &amp;c. arrogate that which the Father hath giuen
to the Sonne onely (to weet) in the floore of the Church,
to take the fanne, and seuer the chaffe from the wheat.
The elect are the first borne, whose names are
written in heauen, Heb. 12. 23. Now, what earthly
man will take vpon him to reade that which is
written in heauen? Saint
                           Prosp. l. de Grat. &amp; libero arbitrio, ad Ruffin: Certum apud Deuin, definitum
                              
                                 
                              
                              que

                        Prosper forbeares it;
defining, that God is hee who defineth the certaine
number of those, who are predestinated to eternall life.
Whence we may rightly conclude, that the Pope,
in canonizing Saints, and entering them into the
heauenly Hierusalem, incurres into a pra

                           unire,
by encroching on the prerogatiue of Almighty
God, who reserueth to himselfe alone the discerning
of vessels of honour, from vessels of dishonour,
that is, the elect from the reprobate.
But our aduersaries obiect, If wee restraine the

Certum apud Deum esse numerum electorum, tam impium

est negare, quàam ipsi gratiae contraire: It is as impious
to deny, that the number of the elect is certaine
with God, as to deny grace it selfe. And will any dare
to call that a fansie or an imaginary Idea, which
is most certaine in the knowledge of God? Secondly,
we teach not, that the Church in this
notion is an Idea, extra rem, or singularia, or a body
houering in the aire, or floting in the fansie: we
teach, that it truly subsisteth, partly in heauen
in the triumphant; and partly on earth, in the
militant part therof. This militant part, though
in respect of the whol number &amp; inward calling,
it bee inuisible, yet in respect of the outward calling
to, and profession of sauing faith, it is alwaies
more or lesse visible. The elect are visible men,
and exist in the visible congregations of Christians,
as the apple in the ey, or a Diamond in a
Ring, or the soule in the body. As Athens is called

of them principally, are those glorious titles
giuen, and gracious promises made to the
Church, which are registred in holy Scripture.
                     The third assertion (which trencheth neer vpon
our question).
                     The Church, in a larger notion, comprehendeth all
those who eternally professe the true worship of God in
Christ. Thus Lactantius
                           Lactan. l. 4. Instit. dium. c. vlt. 
                        defineth the Church:
Catholica Ecclesia est, quae verum Dei cultum retinet:
hic est fons veritatis, hoc est domicilium fidei, hoc Templum

Dei: quo si quis non intrarit, vel a quo si quit exiuerit,
àspe vitae ac salutis aeternae alienus est &amp;c. That
is the Catholique Church, which retaines the true worship
of God. This is the Fountaine of truth: this the House
of faith: this is the Temple of God: he that shall not enter
heerein, or shall depart hence, is farre from the hope
of life and eternall saluation. Of the Church in
this acception, ourMat. 18. 17. Sauiours words are to bee
vnderstood, If hee refuse to heare the Church, let him
be to thee as an Heathen or Publican. And Saint Lukes,
Acts 15. 22.Then pleased it the Apostles and Elders with the
whole Church, &amp;c. And1. Cor. 11. 22. Saint Paul's, Despiseyee the
Church of God, &amp;c? And in his Epistle to the
                        Ephes. 3. 2. Ephesians:
Vnto him bee glory in the Church, &amp;c. And to
                        1. Tim. 3. 5.Timothy: How shall hee take care of the Church of
God? The Church in this notion is in Scripture
compared to a field, wherein are tares with the
wheat; a floore, wherein is chaffe with graine;
a net, wherein are sweet fish, and rotten; an
house, in which are precious vessels and vile;
to the Ark, in which were cleane and vncleane
beasts. To the Church taken in this sense,
Mat. 16. 18.Christ directeth vs: Tell the Church. And Saint
Paul, That1. Tim. 3. 15. thou maist knowe how thou oughtest to behaue
thy self in the House of God, which is the Church of
the liuing God. And Saint
                        
                           Cypr. de simplic. praelat. Non pertinet ad Christi praemia, qui relinquit Ecclesiam Christi. alienus est: profanus est: habere

right to the rewards of Christ, who leaueth the Church
of Christ: hee is a stranger: hee is a profane person: for
hee cannot haue God to his Father, who hath not the
Church for his Mother. And Saint
                        
                           Aug. confess. l. 8. Augustine,Non deputabo te inter Chr

                           e videro. I will
not account thee a Christian, vnlesse, I see thee in the
Church.
                  
                  
                     
                     The fourth assertion.
                     The Church in this notion, as it extends to all that
professe the true Religion, and participate in the pledges
of saluation, was euer, is, and shall be in some degree
visible to the end of the world. That it hath euer
beene hitherto visible, all Histories accord: and
that it shall so continue to the worlds end, our
Sauiours words are our warrant,
                        Mat. 28. 20. Goe yee, and
teach all nations, &amp;c. andle, I am with you alwaies, euen
vnto the end of the world. For the continuance of
Gods Word, the Prophet Esay is most peremptory:
ThisEsay 59. 21. is my couenant with thee, saith the Lord,
&amp;c. My words which I haue put into thy mouth, shall
not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy
seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seeds seed, from
hence-foorth for euer. And Christs words are as
direct for the Sacraments, that they shall bee administred,
till his second comming:
                        1. Cor. 11. 26. As oft as yee
eat of this Bread, and drink of this Cup, yee shew foorth
the Lords death till hee come. And lastly, S. Paul's
words are as expresse for the Ministery:
                        Ephes. 4. 11. 12. 13. He gaue
some Apostles, some Prophets, &amp;c. till wee all come
in the vnity of the faith, &amp;c. It is true, Antichrist
shall make great hauocke of the Church, and
there shall be such a falling away, that Christ at
his second comming shall scarce finde faith on the
earth: false prophets, and false Christs shall arise, and
seduce, if it were possible, the elect; but that is not possible:
hell-gates shall neuer so farre preuaile against the
Church. Whatsoeuer becommeth of hypocrites

and temporizers, it is certaine that the elect shall
remaine in it, and retaine the 
                              〈◊〉
                            faith; and if

on the Conference, spendeth many lines and
much labour in fortifying it, as a strong bulwark
(as hee imagineth) against vs. I conclude therefore
with Saint Ambrose,Hexam. l. 4. c. 2. Ecclesia

                     The fift assertion.
                     The militant visible Church is not alwaies equally
visible, but sometimes it is more visible, sometimes it is
lesse. It was more visible in the Prophet Dauid's
dayes,Psal. 79. 1. 2. when he sung, In Iurie is God knowne, his
name is great in Israel, then it was in the time that
                        Hos. 3. 4.Hosea prophecies of, Israel shall remain many daies
without a King, and without a sacrifice. It was more
visible in the daies
                        Mal. 1. 11. Malachie foreshews of, From
the rising of the Sunne, euen to the going downe there

of, my name shall be great among the Gentiles, then in
the daies
                        1. King. 19. 18. Eliah complaineth of: I, euen I, am left
alone. The Church was more visible in the daies
of Salomon, when she is compared to aPsal. 45. 10. Queene
honourably attended, then in the daies Saint
Iohn foretelleth of, when shee is compared to a
                        Reu. 12. 7.Woman flying into the wildernesse. Shee was more
visible in the daies
                        Esay 49. 23. Esay fortelleth of, Kings
shall bee thy nursing Fathers, and Queenes thy nursing
mothers, then in the daies of Antichrists tyrannie,
when KingsApoc. 17. 17. shall giue their Kingdome to the
beast. In regard of this mutable estate of the militant
Church,
                        Mica. 7. 8. Micah giueth her this Motto:
Reioyce not ouer mee, O my enemy: though I fall, I shall
rise againe. And Salomon likeneth her to the
Moone:
                        Cant. 6. 10. My Loue is faire as the Moone. To which
ground Saint Austen alluding, interpreteth,
                        Aug. in Psal. 10.Obscuram Lunam Ecclesiam, the Moone in the Eclipse
or darkned, the Church in trouble and
persecution. And Saint

visible, conspicuous and ample, then the true Church:
and consequently, eminent Visibility, amplitude, and
splendor is no certaine note of the true Church. The
glorious face and outside of a Church, which
dazleth our aduersaries eyes, was rather against
                        1. Kings 22. 22.Michea, then for him: all the Prophets prophecied,
&amp;c. It was rather against
                        1. Kings 19. 10. Eliah, then for him:

and hee took no notice in a manner of any
seruant of God but himselfe. It was rather against
                        Ier. 18. 18.Ieremy, then for him, when all the Priests
took counsell against him, saying, The law shall not depart
from the Priest, &amp;c. Nay, the glorious outside
and face of a Church, was rather against
Mat. 27. 1.Christ himselfe, then for him. All the chiefe
Priests and Elders took counsell against Iesus.

                     When there is a difference betweene the visible professors
of Christianity, and each party pretendeth it selfe
to bee the true Church, in opposition to the other, the onely
sure and infallible meanes to know which of the dissident
parties are of the true Church, is, by trying their
doctrine by Scripture. To this touch-stone of truth,
the Prophet
                        Esay 8. 20. Esay directeth vs, To the Law, and to
the Testimony, if they speak not according to this Word,
it is because there is no light in them. And our blessed
Sauiour;

                        ? Formerly it was
shewed many waies, what was the true Church
of Christ, and what was Gentilism: but now it is
knowne no other way, which is the true Church
of Christ, but onely by the Scriptures. Wherefore,
because all these things which properly belong
vnto Christ in truth, euen those heresies
haue in shadow; in like manner the Church, in
like manner the Scriptures, in like manner Baptisme,
in like manner the Lords Supper, and all
other things; finally, Christ himselfe: Hee therfore,
who is desirous to know which is the true
Church of Christ, whence should hee know it, in
such a great confusion of multitude, but onely by the
Scriptures? And a little after, Hee that will therefore
know which is the true Church of Christ, whence should
hee know it, but onely by the Scriptures? It is obserued
by those who follow the Law, that when a
Defendant excepts against the iudgement &amp; iurisdiction
of the Court, he certainely despaires

of his cause in that Court. And what can wee interpret
it in our aduersaries, but distrust and despaire
of their cause, to detract as they doe from
the perfection, and except against the authority
and sufficiency of Scripture, for deciding all controuersies?

Desperation. They appeale from Scripture,
vnder pretence, that it is an imperfect rule, and
dumbe Iudge, and therefore refuse to be tryed
by it in the points of difference betweene vs:
why? because that if they should referre the ending

                     The eightth Assertion.
                     
                        The paucitie of right Beleeuers, and obscurity and
latencie of the true Church, protesting against the
corruption and idolatry in the later ages therof,
is most clearely foretold in Scripture. First, by
ourLuke 18. 8. Sauiour: When the Sonne of man commeth,
shall he finde faith on the earth?In hunc locum. Maldonat the Iesuite
answereth, Vix fideminueniet: He shall scarce
finde faith. FalseMat. 24. 11, et 24.
                            Christs and false prophets shall arise,
and shall seduce many, yea, they shall do signes and
wonders, and seduce, if it were possible, the Elect. Secondly,
by Saint1. Tim. 4. 1. 
                        Paul, the Spirit speaketh 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        ,
exertè, expresly, that in the latter dayes some shall
fall from the faith. And in the second, to the2. Thes. 1. 
                        Thes. 1.
There shall be a falling away first. Thirdly, by Saint

                        Reu. 10. 3, 12.
                        Iohn, After a thousand yeers, Satan must bee loosed
a little season. And,Reu. 12. 4. 
                        The taile of the Dragon drew the
third part of the Starres of Heauen. And,Reu. 13. 3, 4. 
                        All the
world wondred after the Beast, and they worshipped the
Beast,et. v. 8. saying, Who is like vnto the Beast, &amp;c.? All
that dwell vpon the earth shall worship him, whose
names are not written in the Booke of Life, &amp;c.Reu. 18. 3. All
nations haue drunke of the wine of the wrath of her
fornications, &amp;c. And no maruell, that the true
seruants of God were reduced to such a paucity,
when the diuell and Antichrist set all their forces
against them.Apoc. 12. 15. 
                        The Serpent casts out of his mouth
water, as a flood, after the woman, that hee might cause

                           r to be caried away of the flood. I might alledge many
pregnant testimonies, both out of the antient
Fathers, &amp; the learned Papists also of later time,
for the blacke and gloomie, darke and dismall
dayes of the Church vnder the last and greatest
persecution by Antichrist. But SaintAug ep. 80.
                         
                        Austens
testimony is so cleere for the obscurity and latency
of the Church, that I need adde no more.
Ecclesia est Sol, Luna, et Stellae: quando Sol obscurabitur,
et Luna non dabit lucem suam, et Stellae cadent de
coelo, Ecclesia non apparebit, impijs vltra modum saeuientibus:
The Church is Sunne, Moone, and
Starres: when the Sunne shall be darkned, and
the Moone shall not giue her light, and the
Starres shall fall from heauen, the Church shall
not appeare, the wicked raging against her without
all measure. Mee thinks I heare our aduersaries
say, What makes this obseruation for the

Protestant Church or faith? I answer, Much euery
way. It furnisheth vs both with a strong defensiue
weapon, and offensiue also. The defensiue
may be thus framed:
                     
                        That Church which hath beene persecuted,
massacred, wasted, and driuen to
great extremity, and reduced to a small
number, resembleth the true Church, as
the state thereof is described in her later
Ages.
                     
                     
                        But the Protestant Church, especially
since the 1000 yeere after Christ, hath
beene persecuted, massacred, wasted, and
driuen to great extremity, and reduced to
a small number:
                     
                     
                        Therefore the Protestant Church in
this respect resembleth the true Church;
and consequently her obscurity maketh rather
for her, then against her.
                     
                     We may also on this Anuil shape an offensiue
weapon in this manner:
                     
                        The true Church, in the later Ages
thereof, must be in great distresse, and driuen
to a narrow compasse.
                     
                     
                        The Popish Church hath not beene
so:
                     
                     
                        Therefore the Popish Church is not the
true Church.
                     
                     For they make eminent Visibility and splendour,
a note of their Church. If they answer, that
their Church, vnder heathen and Arrian Emperors,

hath beene grieuously persecuted, I
reply:
                     First, that those who suffered Martyrdome in
those daies, were rather our Martyrs then, theirs,
because they sealed with their bloud, the truth
of Scripture-Doctrine, and not of Popish traditions,
or additions.
                     Secondly, those blessed Martyrs suffered in the
first Ages of the Church, long before the 1000
yeere, in which Satan was let loose: but wee
speake of the persecutions of the true Church in
her latter Ages. Therefore when the Papists insultingly
demand of vs, Where appeared your
Church in the Ages before Luther? the best
way to represse their insolency, is, to put a crosse
interrogatorie to them, Where did your Church
lie hid? When did it fly into the Wildernesse, for the
space of 1260 dayes? When did the Beast with seuuen
heads, and tenne hornes, push at it? In the raigne
of what Popes did the red Dragon cast a flood of
waters to drowne her? As for the predecessors of
our faith, and Standard-bearers of our Religion,
it appeareth vpon their owne records, how the
Whore of Babylon embrued her hands, and died her
garments scarlet-red in the blood of them, persecuting
and executing them vnder the names
of Berengarians, Lyonists, Henricians, Petrobrusians,
Albingenses, Waldenses, Wickleuists, Thaborites,
Hussites, Lutherans, Caluinists, and Hugonots, and
the like. Heere see the craft of Satan, and malice
of Antichrist and his Ministers: they was

                        e the

flock of Christ with bloudy slaughters, and require
of vs, Where are those of our brethren
whom they haue slaine? They traduce vs for
paucity, whom they by their massacres haue
brought to so small a number. They vpbraid
vs with those maymes, and skarres which themselues
haue giuen vs, and put vs to produce those
euidences which themselues haue burned and
made away, as shall appeare more at large hereafter.
                  
                  
                     The ninth Assertion.
                     Errors in doctrine, and abuses in practice, for the most
part steale in secretly, and by degrees, sensim sine sensu,
and are therefore seldome discerned, and openly opposed,
before they get head and strength. This

hides himselfe as much as hee can, and
                        
sheweth his chiefe skill in wreathing himselfe
into foulds, hee thrusts himselfe into darke and
blind holes, &amp;c. This2. Pet. 2. 1. note Tertullian took from
Saint Peter: There shall bee false teachers among you▪
who shall priuily bring in damnable heresies. And Saint
Peter himselfe might gather it from our Sauiours
words,Mat. 13. 25. 
                        Whil'st men slept, the enemy came, and so
                              •
                           ed
tares. And therefore Bellarmine, and Ca
                              •
                           pi

                           n,
and M. Fisher, doe but dreame, when they conceiue
that the enemy hath not sowne the tares
of heresies, and superstitions, in the Church of
Rome, because (as they suppose) that we cannot
shew the precise time when all these tares were
sowne. For, our Sauiour makes answer to this
question (Vnde zizania? Whence were these 
                              〈◊〉
                           ?)
for vs, They were sowne whilst men slept. Changes
and alterations are of two sorts: some are
violent, and sudden, and with a great noise; others
are made by degrees, and come in piece-meale,
and without any sound at all. In the former kinde
it is no matter of difficulty, out of stories to shew
the precise time, when such great and sudden
alterations befell in Church or Cōmon-wealth:
but in the latter kinde it is very difficult, and
for the most part impossible. When a great tree
beeing torne by a tempest, ingentem traxit 
                              〈◊〉
                            ruinam,
euery man obserueth it: but who
can tell when a great and thick timber-tree beginneth
first to rotte? The Historians precisely
set down the yeer and day, wherein the Temple
of Diana was burned by Herasastratus, and Saint

                        Paul's Steeple in London by lightning: but who
can out of any Story, or otherwise, designe the
day, or yeere, when Paul's Church beganne to
decay? yet no man that now seeth it, maketh question,
but that it is very much ruined: the beame
out of the timber, and stone out of the wall, cry for speedy
reparations. By the Iesuites argument, an aged
decrepid man, all gray-headed, might forsweare
and out-face his Age, because no man,
nor perhaps himselfe obserued when hee beganne
to grow old first, or had his first gray haire
on his head or beard. Our Sauiour very fitly
compares heresies to tares, which wee see when
they are growne, though wee see them not in
their first growth, or as they grow. No man can
perceiue the index in a Watch, or finger in a Diall
to wagge or stirre: yet hee that going abroad,
when it points to one a clock, and returning
home, findeth it points to six, or twelue a clock,
knoweth infallibly, that it hath mooued, and
that no small space. In like maner, though wee
cannot, in all particular points of difference betweene
vs and the Church of Rome, designe
the moment of time, when corruptions
and innouations stole in: yet finding the doctrine
and manners of the Church at one point (as
it were) in the Primitiue times, and in latter
Ages at a farre distant point, nay quite opposite;
wee know, that the finger hath mooued, that is, that
great changes, and alterations, and innouations
haue beene. Shall wee deny, that there is idolatry

in the world, because wee know not who
was the first Idolater; nor precisely, when men
first fell from true Religion? Bellarmine and some
others fetch it from some of Noah's posterity after
the flood: butHaerm
                              •
                           n Luangel. 
                        Barradus endeuoreth to
prooue, that the tares of idolatry were sowne in
the world before the flood, yet it appeares on no
record, who was the first Idolater in the world.
Some of Noah's posterity degenerated from the
true worship &amp; seruice of God, to Gentilism and
superstition; yet who can demonstrate the time
when, or the place where they first began to
adulterate the true seruice of God, with infinite
abuses and abominations? How did the Scribes
and Pharises, at the comming of Christ, corrupt
the doctrine of the Law with false glosses, and
abrogate it with their owne traditions? Yet no
man can shew the originall or first deuiser of all
their false glosses and vaine traditions. To
come neerer to our aduersaries: The Fathers in
theSess. vigess. 2. caenone 9. decretum de obseru

corruptions &amp; abuses haue crept into the Masse
it self, eyther by the fault of times, or negligence
and wickednesse of men. Cùm multaiam, siue temporum

&amp;c. Sith many things, through the fault
of times, or the negligence and wickednesse of
men, haue seemed to haue crept in (to the Masse)
which are repugnant to the dignity of so great a
Sacrifice, wee appoint, &amp;c. Yet when these

abuses crept in, and by whose fault, neither doe
they there, neither can any Papist punctually demonstrate.
The Physicians iudge of their patients
two manner of waies; eyther à decubitu, that
is, from the time of their lying downe, and yeelding
themselues to their bed; or ab actionibus lasis,
that is, from the time that their appetites,
and disgestion, and other faculties, sensibly faile
in dooing their functions. In like manner are we
to iudge of the diseases of the Church: some
wee may àdecubitu, from her apparant declining
in iudgement to error: but other, which we cannot
so iudge certainely of, yet wee may most infallibly
by the other meanes, ab actionibus lasis,
from her sensible failings in her vitall faculties
and functions, viz. Preaching of the Word, Administration
of the Sacraments, and exercise of
Ecclesiasticall discipline. To cloze vp this note;
Though many learned Protestant Diuines haue
wrote to good purpose touching the first leake
in Peters ship, yet none seemeth to mee to hit the
point more fully, then our excellently learned

                  The generall Conclusion.
                  The Protestant Church, according to the distinctions
and Assertions premised, hath beene in all Ages in
some degree visible.
                  Thus much of the first Question propounded
by the Iesuite, touching the Visibility
of the Protestant Church in all
Ages.
                  The second Question touching the Catalogue
of names, follows.
               
            
            
               
               
               Touching the Names of visible
Protestants in all Ages.
               The second Question.
               WHether visible Protestants are to bee named in
all Ages out of good Authors?
               
                  To this Question I answer,
as to the former, by

                        Distinctions.
                        Assertions.
                     
                  
               
               
                  The first Distinction.
                  Visible Protestants are either,
                  Such as subscribe to the harmony of Protestant
Confessions, in each point of faith
and Theologicall Conclusion;
                  Or such as haue deliuered, either implicitly,
or explicitly, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , positiuely, or

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , by way of opposition, some point
or points of Protestant Doctrine; especially,
if it cannot be proued, that they held any
doctrine de fide, repugnant to the Protestants
faith, or different from them in any point of
moment, or very materiall, much lesse fundamentall.
                  
                     In this Question, neither is it reasonable, neither
indeed doth the Iesuite demand, that wee

should prooue visible Protestants in all Ages in
the first sense, but in the later onely. His words
are,
                     c. 1. p. 11. For auoiding of all mis-taking, and consequently,
needlesse and fruitlesse Disputes, M. Fisher in his
Question requireth, first, that names of men in all Ages
be set down: whom Sir Humphrey Linde and his
friends conceiue to haue been Protestants. Secondly,
that those men, whose names they set downe,
bee shewed out of good Authors, to agree in houlding
some points of faith, in which Protestants differ from
Roman Catholiques. Thirdly, that Sir Humphrey
Linde or his friends will defend against M. Fisher,
that the same men held no other points of faith different
one from another, and from the present Protestant
Doctrine.
               
               
                  The second Distinction.
                  The Names of Protestants are of two sorts;
                  
                     Proper; as, Bertram, Lollard, Dulcinus, Caluin,
Beza, Iewell, &amp;c.
                  Appellatiue; as, Protestants, Gospellers, Reformers,
Albingenses, Waldenses, Lionists, Piccards,
Turlepins; and generally, all such names
as haue either been assumed by any society
of Protestants, to distinguish themselues
from others; or cast vpon them by way of
reproach, by their Aduersaries whose reproaches
they (and wee) accounted their
glory.
                  In this Question, although the Iesuite seemeth
to take Names in the first sense, yet he cannot be

so grossely ignorant, as not to knowe, that it is
aboundantly sufficient for the proof of a visible
Church (euen à posteriori) to proue out of good
Authors the appellatiue Names of Protestants in
all Ages. No man doubteth, that it is a sufficient
Argument to prooue the Visibility of the true
Church in Israel in Elias time, to produce that sacred
Record of seuen thousand that neuer bowed
their knees to Baal; albeit neither doth the Spirit
of God there set down, neither can any man liuing
now tell what was the proper name of any
one of them. No Geographer will euer make
question, but that there are now many visible
Churches of Christians in Africa, and diuerse
parts of Asia, vnder the Turk and Tartar, knowne
by the names of Abyssens, Maronits, Cophti, Armenians,
Georgians, or the like: and yet neither can
the Geographers themselues peraduenture, nor
you nor I presently giue the proper name of any
one of them. For my part, I know but one Greek
Christian, sometime Student in Oxford; Metrophanes
Critopulus.
                  
               
               
                  The third Distinction.
                  These words, Protestants are to be named, may admit
of a double construction;
                  Either that names ought to be produced,
and that we are bound to produce them, to
proue the Visibility of our Church; as if,
without such producing, the protestant cause
shold any way suffer or receiue any prejudice

Or that such names may bee produced,
and that there are such Records yet extant,
out of which wee are able to makes a Catalogue
of Protestant professors.
                  In this question, the Iesuite holdeth, that the
names of Protestants in the first sense are to bee
produced, that is, ought to bee produced, and
must of necessitie, to proue the visibility of our
Church: but hee denieth it in the second sense,
that is, that such names can bee produced. On
the contrary, my Tenets are, that Visible Protestants
are to bee named in the second sense, that is, are 
                        
                           •
                        
                        minable;
but not in the first sense. Though wee
need not make any such Catalogue, yet ex superabundanti,
I refuse not to doe it: our cause is so
richly furnished, that wee can do it though wee
are not bound to do it, for the reasons partly alledged
in the conference, partly confirmed and
enlarged in the defence thereof.
               
               
                  The fourth Distnction.
                  Good Authors are of two sorts;
                  Of the first rank: and such are Classicke,
Theological or Historical Authors; against
which neither Papists nor Protestants much
except, but both account them of great
worth and credit.
                  Of the second ranke: and such are those
Authors, who though they are not of any
singular or eminent note, yet they may bee
tearmed good, according to the ages in
which they liued, which afforded no better.
                  
                     
In this question, I restrain not good Authors to
those of the first rank only, but admit also of those
of the second. For, as when the people atBodin. de rep. ex Liuio. 
                     Capua
were so incensed against the Senatours, that they
had a purpose presently to doffe them out of
their places and liues too; a wise man among
them aduised them, before they put the ould
Senatours to the sword, to thinke of fitter men
to put in their places: which when they could
not agree vpon, in the end it was resolued, that
the ould should continue: In like manner, if the
Iesuites except against any of the Authors
which I shall alledge in the later blinde ages,
as being not of sufficient credit for vs to relie vpon
in so weightie a controuersie, as the Iesuites
make this to bee; I require of the Iesuites, to
produce fitter men, &amp; better Authors, who liued
in those times; &amp; in case they cannot, then to let
those stand for good whom wee alledge for our
selues: for wee are to take Authors and Records
such as we can finde, not to make such as wee
wish. And therefore Scaliger, as truly as tartly,
reproueth Baronius, quod Annales faceret, non scriberet,
that he wrote not Annales, but made them
out of his owne braine. A true Record, though
neuer so foule-written and torne, is better then
a forged Deed, though neuer so faire and legible.
Some later Papists, excepting against diuers
Authors alledged by vs, shall not disable
those Authors, vnlesse they can make good
their exceptions against them. For example:

though Genebrard, or Coccius, or 
                        〈…〉
                     
disgracefully of Abbas V
                           •
                        spergensis, or 
                        〈…〉
                      
                     C
                           •
                        rdinalis,
or Platina, or Auentinus, yet vnless they can
or could iustly tax or charge them, they must and
shall stand for good witnesses against Papists.
These cautions and distinctions premised, I will
now set downe the state of this second question,
in the Assertions following.
               
               
                  The first Assertion.
                  
                     AMong the Professors of the Truth, there may be
differences of iudgement; not onely touching
rites, and ceremonies, and matters of discipline,
but also touching points of doctrine, so the points be not
main and fundamentall, or such as are cleerly 
                           •
                        nd expressely
defined by the Church out of manifest Te
                           •
                        ts of
Scripture. This conclusion I ground on those
words of Saint Paul:1. Cor. 3. 12. 15, &amp;c. If any man build on this
Foundation, gold, &amp;c. or hay and stubble, &amp;c. if any
mans work shall be burnt, he shall suffer losse, but hee
himself shall be saued, &amp;c. To this distinction of
Foundations-doctrine, without which a man cannot
be saued; and doctrines built vpon the Foundation,
which may be held, or not held, without
danger of saluation, Saint Ambrose alludes:Comment. in Luc. lib. 5. c. 9. Si quae est Ecclesiae, quae fidem respuat, nec Apostolicae praedicationis fundamenta retine at, ne quam labem possit aspergere, deserenda est. 
                     If
there be any Church which refuseth faith, and 
                           •
                        eepeth
not the foundation of Apostolicall doctrine, lest it should
cast any spot on vs, it must bee forsaken. And Saint

                        Prosp. de grat. et lib. arbitri. ad Ruffinum. Pelagiana haeresis quibus impietatum veneris viscera Ecclesiae atque ipsa vitalia Corpris Christi voluerit occupare, &amp;c.
                     Prosper; where hee insinuates a distinction of
heresies. Some like the Pelagian, poisoning the
bowels, and surprising the very vitals of Christs

(mysticall) Body; others affecting and infecting
other parts further from the heart, and therefore
not so dangerous.Aduers. haer. 
                     Vincentius Lyrinensis glanceth
at the former distinction of doctrines fundamentall,
and not fundamentall. The former he calleth,
Fidei regula
                           ••
                        , the rule of faith; the later,
Diuinae Legis quaestiunculas, subtill questions concerning
the Law of God: in which, he saith, we
need not much seek the Fathers consent. Saint
Lib. 1. contra Iul. Pelag. c. 6.
                     Austen also, when he was pressed by Iulian the
Pelagian with a testimony out of Saint Chrysostome,
laieth hold on the buckler of a like distinction:
Sanctus, inquit, Iohannes Constantinopolitanusnegat, esse in paruulis originale peccatum:
                     Holy,
saith he, Iohn of Constantinople denieth, that originall
sinne is in little children.

                           que

                           que
                         optimi regulae
catholicae defensores (salua fidei compage) non consonant:
&amp; alius aliò, vna de re, meliùs aliquid dicit &amp;
veriùs. Hoc autem, de quo nunc agimus, ad ipsa fidei
pertinet fundamenta:
                     GOD forbid, that Iohn of
Constantinople concerning the baptism of little
or yong children, and their freedom by Christ
from the hand-writing, should gain-stand so
many and so worthy of his fellow-Bishops; especially,

                        Innocent, Bishop of Rome, Cyprian of
Carthage, Basil of Cappadocia, Gregorie of Nazianzen
Hilarie of France, and Ambrose of Millain.
Some things there are, in which the most
learned, and best defenders of the catholique
rule (the bond of faith preserued) do somtimes
not agree among themselues: and one, in some
one thing, saith somewhat better and righter
than another. But this, wherein now we deal,
belongeth to the very grounds of faith.
                  
                  Vnlesse we admit of such a distinction, neither
we, nor the Romane Church, nor the Greek, nor
any Church now in Christendome, is able to
produce a Catalogue of visible Professors of
their faith in any antient Age, much lesse in all
Ages. And therefore, if M. Fisher and his fellow-Iesuites
require of a true Church, a Catalogue
of such Professors as in all Ages held, not onely
the same fundamentall and principall points of
faith, but also all the same doctrinall conclusions
and particular deductions, I must aduise him, in
the words of Constantine the Great, spoken to
Nouatus, to make a ladder, and go vp to heauen alone.
As the Fathers differ from vs in some things, so
also they differ among themselues: yet, as they
esteemed themselues (notwithstanding these differences)
to be members of the same Catholick
Church; so doo we esteem the said Fathers, professors
of our Protestant Doctrine. Our Aduersaries
lay claim to them also; and yet they cannot
deny, but that the Fathers dissent from them

in some points of no small moment. Papias, the
scholar of Saint Iohn the Euangelist, did eat the
sowre grape of the Millenarie Error: and Iustin
Martyr, Iraeneus, Lactantius, and the Fathers generally
(before Saint Ierome's time), had their
teeth set on edge therewith.
                        Ioseph. Scal. Notae in nouum Testamentum. 
                     Scaliger, well seen
in Antiquity, obserues, Omnes veteres Christianos,
etiam infra aetatem Augustini, putâsse, animas tam
piorum quàm impiorum in centro terrae, tanquam quodam
conceptaculo, expectare diem iudicij: quod Tertullianus
eleganer dixit, In candidâ expectare diem
iudicij. Praerogatiuam tamen dant Martyribus, quos
vno saltu recta in Paradisum deferri volunt: All the
antient Christians, yea, euenor within. before the time of
Saint Augustine, thought, the soules aswell of
the godly as vngodly, in the centre of the earth,
as it were in some receptacle, to expect the day
of iudgement: which Tertullian elegantly calls,
Allud. ad Ro. Magistr. qui candidati, &amp;c.
                     In candidâ to look for the day of iudgement. Yet
they yeeld a prerogatiue to the Martyrs, whom
they will haue to bee carried directly into Paradise
at one leap or jump. Dooth your Church
approoue of this opinion? SaintLib. 2. Ep. 3. Siquis de Antecessoribus nostris vel ignor anter, vel simpliciter, non hoc obseruauit &amp; tenuit, quod nos dominus docuit, &amp;c. potest simpliciter eius per indulgentiam domini venia concedi, &amp;c. 
                     Cyprian findeth
great fault with those, who before his time
administred the Sacrament without wine, vsing
water in stead of it: If any of our Ancestors, either
ignorantly, or simply, hath not obserued and kept that
which our Lord hath taught vs, &amp;c. through our Lords
indulgency, pardon may bee granted to his simplicity.
This he proueth to be a grosse error, and a foule
abuse; yet he excludeth not them who are tainted

with this spot, from hope of saluation. And
Saint Cyprian himself had reason to censure charitably
an errour in others, because himself needed
at least a pardon of course for his opinion
touching re-baptizing: for, his zeal against Hereticks
transported him so farre, that he rejected
and disannulled Baptisme administred by them:
whereby he may seem to touch dangerously vpon
the rock of the Donatists heresie: yet Saint
Lib. 1. contra Donatistas. c. 18 Quid ergo? ille vir sanctus de Baptismo aliter sentiens quam se res habebas, quae posteae pertractata &amp; diligentissima consideratione firmatae est, in catholicae vnitate permansit, &amp; charitatis vbertate compensatum est, &amp; pas

                     Austen doubteth not to affirm, that he made a
recompence for this his errour, by the aboundance
of his charity in his life, and plentifull effusion
of his bloud for the testimony of Christ
at his death. As it was said of Augustus;

Pompey's statues, hee made his owne stand

                     The Professors of the truth haue had alwaies false
scandals laid vpon their faith and life. Our blessed
Redeemers most holy Doctrine and sanctified
life, escaped not the slanders of malicious
tongues set on fire of hell. Saint Stephen was traduced
forActs 6. 11 blasphemie against God and Moses;
Saint Paul, forActs 24. 14 Heresie. I tremble to rehearse
what malice hath broached against the Saints
and Martyrs in the Primitiue Church; as that

But as God, in former times, vsed the tongue
of Pliny, and diuers other Gentiles, to licke out
those blots which were cast on the Christians by
Gentiles: so, in these later times also, hath God
made the tongues of Papists themselues to serue
as spunges, to wipe away Popish aspersions vpon
the aboue-named Professors of truth, For the 9.

It shall suffice, for the strengthning of my former
conclusion, to call in three or foure Papists
of note, for their purgation: they are Du Hallyan,
Rainerius, Thuanus, and Cocleus. Hallyan speakes
but lispingly, because he durst not speake plaine,
yet hee saith enough to conuince the enemies of
the truth, of shamefull calumniation.Hist. Gal. l. 10. The principall

ingenuously confesseth: This sect hath a
great shew of godlinesse, because they liue iustly before
men, and beleeue all things well concerning God, and
all the articles contained in the Creed: solummodò Romanam
Ecclesiam blasphemant et Clerum; onely they
speake euill of the Church of Rome and of the clergie.
Lib. 6.Thuanus, after hee had set downe truly the opinions
of the Waldenses, wherein they concurre
with the Reformed Churches at this day,
addeth, His praecipuis et certis eorum doctrinae capitibus,

                     When hee was
required by the Bishops, to abiure the doctrine hee had
taught, he refused so to do, lest he should wound his conscience
and the truth of God; but withall protesteth,

last gaspe, with a complaint against his false accusers,

it vpon his death, that hee taught nothing but the truth

mouth of his accusers, which afterwards possessed
the Romish Priests and Iesuits, and by them
vented these prodigious slanders vpon our
doctrine; affirming, that wee teach,

akin to them: they think, they doo God good
seruice, in blaspheming and scandalizing the
truth of God, and the professors thereof. The

                  The third Assertion.
                  
                     God hath, and alwaies had, many true seruants and
worshippers of him in secret; whose names cannot bee
produced nor rehearsed by an exact Catalogue. I suppose,
no Papist wil deny this conclusion, because
it is grounded on the Oracle of God. When
1 Kings 19 14. &amp; 18
                     Eliah complained, The children of Israel haue forsaken
thy Couenant, throwne down thine Altars, and
slain thy Prophets with the sword; and I, euen lonely,
am left, &amp;c. the Oracle answereth, Yet I haue reserued
to my self seuen thousand in Israel, &amp;c. Such
were they that sighed for all the abominations

that were in Ierusalem: vpon whose fore-head, God
commanded aEzek. 9. 4 marke to bee set. Such were those,
who though they remained most of them in the
outward communion with the Church of
Rome, yet groned vnder that Babylonish yoke,
and in heart abhorred the idolatrie and superstition
raigning in that Church; and they desired,
with sighes and teares, a reformation before Luther.
Of whom,De refor. eccl. 
                     Petrus de Aliaco the Cardinall
thus writeth: As there were seuen thousand that
had not bowed to Baal: so it is to bee hoped, that there
are some that desire the Churches reformation.

                  The fourth Assertion.
                  
                     Some Ages of the Church afford very few Authors
of note, whose Writings haue come to posterity. Whosoeuer
peruseth the Church story, digested into
Centuries or Annales, or cast but a glance of his
eye vpon the Catalogues of Writers made by
Saint Ierom, Suidas, Photius, Gennadius, Abbas,
Tritemius, Illyricus, and Bale, shall finde the Ages
of the Church, to resemble the Starres of the
skie. In some parts wee see many glorious and
eminent Stars; in others, few of any remarkable
greatnesse; and in some, none but blinkards and
obscure ones: In like manner, in some Ages of
the Church, we may behold many worthy and
glorious Lights, like Starres of the first or second
magnitude; in others, few of any note or

bright luster; and in some, none but obscure and
vnknowne Authors; resembling the least and
obscurest Starres in the skie. After we haue passed
the eightth Age of the Church, wee fall into
Cimaerian darknesse.Lib. 4. de Rom. pontif. c. 12.

of the ninth Age with patience, Saeculo hoc nullum

Then this Age, there was none more vnlearned
or vnhappie; in which, whosoeuer studied the
Mathematicks or Philosophy, hee was commonly
accounted a Magician.

flowne away (in this Age), were not indeed
vanished out of the world, but lay close, and hid
themselues vnder Bishops Rochets, and Monkes
Coules; where neither Prateolus nor Norice durst
to search for them. As this ninth Age, so the
tenth, and some others after were very barren of
learned Writers. And therefore no maruaile,
if the haruest wee gather in these Ages, of the
professors of the truth, and defenders thereof by
writing, bee very thinne: for, to leaue an Armie
of bastard apocryphall Authors (as the Papists
do, to maintain the Popes title), or in so weighty
a cause to rely on the ragged regiment of Authors

it rather a dishonor, and disaduantage, then any

                     Since Boniface the Third's time, in the seauenth
Age, and much more since Hildebrand in the tenth,
such was the greatnesse of the Pope, and transcendent
power of the See of Rome, that few durst or might write

freely against the errors and vsurpations thereof. And
therefore it is not to be maruailed, that we haue
not many; but it is rather to bee maruailed, that
wee haue any who haue displayed the abominations
of the Whore of Babylon. The Answer of

they vsed to blame the vices and disolutenes of the said

            A defence of Doctor FEATLY
his proceedings in the Conference,
together with a refutation of Master
FISHERS Answer (vnder the
name of A. C.) to a Treatise
intituled, The Fisher caught in
his owne Net.
            AS Velleius Paterculus obserues, that In
the battell at Philippi, in which Brutus
should haue taken Anthony to task; and
Cassius Augustus; it fell out cleane contrary, so
that Brutus met with Augustus, and Anthony marched
against Cassius: So it came to passe in this
present combate. D. White prepared and prouided
to encounter M. Fisher, his former Antagonist;
and D. Featly was intreated as in Assistant,
to deale in a second place with M. Sweet, if occasion
were offered. Yet vpon a cunning trick of
the Iesuite, discouered immediately before the
Conference, it was then on the place of the

meeting, resolued otherwise by some that were
principally interessed in the businesse, that D.
Featly should beginne with M. Fisher, and oppose
him in the Iesuites question touching the visibility
of the Protestants Church; and D. White (as
there should bee cause) should take off M.
Sweet, if he interposed, as also answer in the contrary
question propounded to the Iesuites, touching
the Visibility of the Romish Church in all Ages.
Thus D. Featly, who intended to be but an Assistant,
contrary to his expectation, was made the
principall Opponent in this Disputation. Wherin,
that hee might the better manage the truthes
quarrell, and satisfie his Auditory, hee set before
his eies certaine rules, partly taken out of Scripture,
partly out of the antient Fathers, to direct
his proceedings by them.
            The first rule isPhil. 2. 3. Saint Paul's: Let nothing bee
done through strife or vaine-glory. God is not in the
fire of contention, nor in the whirle-winde of passion,
but in the still voice of them, who in meeknesse
of spirit seeke the truth out of loue of truth
it selfe, not of desire of victory. Nolunt Scriptur
                     •
                  
ae docere nisi eos qui doceri quaerunt: The Scriptures
will not instruct those, who seek not to bee
instructed by them in this manner. Democritus
fitly compared truth to a iewell in the bottome
of a Well:Veritas in profundo dimersa. if the water bee cleere, we may easily
discerne it; but if troubled, it is impossible to
see the bottome of the Well, much lesse discerne
the most precious Iewel of truth lying in it. For

this cause, D. Featly, in the beginning of the disputation,
as is confessed by A. C.Page 15. earnestly besought
M. Fisher to deale sincerely, as in the sight of
God, setting aside all passion, and by-respects:
and when M. Sweet propounded that condition,
that all bitter speeches should be auoided, D. Featly
with the rest, most willingly accepted of it,
and commended M. Sweet for proposing of
it.
            The second rule isNaz. Apolog. 1.
                Nazianzens: 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               :
It is the best order in all
speech and actions, to begin and end with God. According
to which prescription, D. Featly beganne
with a short Prayer, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                and ended partly
with aThanksgiuing. doxologie, adding to his instance in
Christ our Lord and Sauiour, blessed for euer, at
whose Name all knees must bow, both in heauen, and
earth, and vnder the earth; partly, by an holy adjuration:
M. Fisher, I charge you, as you will

According to which prescription, D.

should bee tied to Logick Forme: for, nimble
wits, like Proteus, will turne themselues into
all Formes; and, vnlesse they bee held fast, and

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , neither
treading inward nor outward in our discourses.
To dispute without Logick, is to rule
without a Ruler, or draw a Circle without a
Compasse, or steer without a Card. In which
respect, although M. Fisher were very vnwilling
to be bound to his Logicall behauiour, yet D.
Featly had great reason to require it of him, because
he bound himself to it, proposing all his
Arguments in Logick Form, and disposing them
in Logick Method; premising Arguments à priori,
before his Argument à posteriori; and Syllogismes,
before his Induction; beginning at the
top in the first Age, and descending to the later,
according to the order of time, nature &amp; dignity.
            The most cunning Work-man that euer▪
wrought with the tools of naturall wit, forceth
all Arguments into two kindes;

                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

The former may not vnfitly be called, 
                  〈◊〉
               
Arguments; the later, Simply and directly proouing.
D. Featly, in this Disputation, made vse of
both: first, of Elencticall Arguments, to discouer
the weaknes of his Aduersaries; and then of
Dicticall, to shew the strength of the Protestants
cause, and the Visibility of their Church in all
Ages.
            The first Argument of the former sort was
couched in these words: 
                  Although divine and
infallible faith is not built vpon deduction out of humane
History.
                Which may be thus propounded
at large:
            
               Whosoeuer propoundeth such a Question,
in which he requireth a conclusion of faith to
be prooued out of meer humane Testimonies
and Records, betraieth his grosse ignorance in
Diuinity.
            
            
               But M. Fisher propoundeth a Question, in
which he requireth a conclusion of faith to be
prooued out of meer humane Histories and
Records:
            
            
               Therefore M. Fisher betraieth his grosse ignorance
in Diuinity.
            
            The Maior, or first Proposition, was prooued

by
                  Bel. l. 2. de Sacr. effec. c. 25 
               Bellarmine's confession; Historiae humanae faciunt
tantùm fidem humanam, cui subesse potest falsum:
Humane Stories and Records beget onely
an humane faith, or rather credulity subject to
error. And it may bee more strongly confirmed
by the testimony of Tertullian:De praescript. c. 16. Aliunde suadere
possunt de rebus fidei, nisi ex Literis fidei? Can they
otherwise perswade in matters of faith, than out
of the Writ of faith? And Saint Augustine:
De nat. et grat. c. 61. And Epist. 112. Si quid diuinarū Scripturarum perspicua firmatur authoritate, sine vlla dubitatione credendum est: alijs vero testibus &amp; credere vel non credere licet, &amp;cSolis Canonicis debeo absolutum, sine vlla recusatione,
consensum: I owe absolute consent, without any
refusall, onely to the Canonicall Scriptures.
The effect cannot exceed the cause; nor the conclusion,
both the premises: and therefore wee
cannot build a diuine and infallible conclusion
(such are all conclusions de fide) vpon meer humane
testimonies, which are not of infallible
truth. All other humane Histories come short
of the Apocryphall Books of Scripture: for,
you rank them with the Canonicall Scriptures;
and we giue them the
                  Zanch. de Relig. christ. &amp; alij. next place to them: yet
the testimonies out of the Apocryphal of Scripture,
may not be alleaged to ground any conclusion
of faith vpon them, as
                  Ruf. in Symb. 
               Ruffinus affirms in
expresse words: Quae omniae legi quidem in Ecclesiis
volucrunt, non tamen proferri ad authoritatem ex his
fidei confirmandam: All which Books they would
haue read in the Churches, but not be produced
to establish faith out of them.
            The Minor or Assumption is thus prooued:
            
               The perpetuall Visibility of the Church is a

conclusion of faith, euidently grounded (as is
confessed) on Christ's promise in Scripture.
            
            
               But M. Fisher requireth in his Question, the
perpetuall Visibility of the Church to be proued
out of meer humane Authors and Stories,
expresly excluding Scripture:
            
            
               Therefore M. Fisher propoundeth a Question,
in which he requireth a conclusion of faith
to be prooued out of meer humane Histories
and Records.
            
            The second Elencticall or reprehensiue Argument
was couched in these words: Although this
Question be grounded on vncertain and false s
                     •
                  pposals,
&amp;c. Which may be thus propounded at large.
            
               That Question which is grounded vpon an
euident false supposall, needeth not to bee discussed,
but ought rather to be exploded.
            
            
               But M. Fishers Question is grounded vpon an
euident false supposall:
            
            
               Therefore M. Fishers Question needeth not
to be discussed, but ought rather to bee exploded.
            
            The Maior, or first Proposition, is euident in
it self: for, to such a Question there needeth no
other Answer to be giuen, but simply to deny the
supposall.
            The Minor, or second Proposition, was thus
proued:
            First, if the names of all Professors are not, nor
euer were, vpon Record, then M. Fishers supposall
is false, viz. that A Protestant Church could

not haue been visible in former ages, vnlesse the names
of all visible professors can now bee shewed.
            
            But all visible professors names are not, nor
euer were on record, as it is certaine, and confessed
by A. C. p. 33.
            
               Therefore Master Fishers supposall is false; viz.
that A Protestant Church could not haue been visible in
former ages vnlesse the names of those visible Professors
could be shewed.
            
               Secondly, if all ancient Records are not now
extant, then it is no good Argument, to say, The
names of visible Protestants in all ages cannot now bee
shewed vpon Record; therefore they were neuer vpon
Record.
            But all ancient Records are not now extant:
            Therefore it is no good Argument, to say, that
because the names of visible Protestants in all
Ages cannot now bee shewed vpon Record;
therefore they were neuer vpon Record.
            These Arguments Master Fisher passed by
with a drie foot, and by his silence granteth it.
            Thirdly, the people of Africa mentioned
by Pliny, were visible men, yet cannot their proper
names be shewed &amp; proued out of good Authors:
for, good Authors report, they had no
proper names at all. With this rather tentatiue
then serious instance, M. Fisher and Master Sweet
were blankt: but Master Boulton, though he confessed
in effect, that they were gon at the common
Law: yet he sought to relieue them by the Chan
                  
                     ••••
                  ,
by saying, that Though those people had no proper

names, yet they had some descriptions, and might
bee knowne by some periphrasis. But it may bee replied,
            1. A description or periphrasis is no proper
name.
            2. They cannot produce out of any good
Authors, any particular description of these
men, whereby they may bee personally and
indiuidually distinguished one from another;
but onely a generall description, that They are a
people in Africa, neere the hill Atlas, which haue
no proper names; and thus it will bee easie to
produce Protestants in all ages, in a generall description
of certaine men, who opposed certaine
errors against, and besides the Doctrine of
Scripture, and especially the errors of the
Church of Rome.
            Fourthly, the Author and Head of the Heretikes
called Acephali, was a visible man, but his
name cannot bee shewed and prooued out of
good Authors: for those Hereticks were therefore
called Acephali, or headless, because the certain
Author and Head of that Heresie could neuer
bee knowne. And heer, if it be lawfull to
pay Master Fisher with his owne coyne, a man
might truly say, that both himselfe, and his as
                     •
                  istant
Master Sweet, and their good friend at a dead 
                     〈◊〉
                  ,
Master Boulton, were all nonplussed with this argument,
for they replied nothing to it.
            Fiftly, the falshood of Master Fishers supposall
(the defence whereof Master Sweet rashly vndertooke

in the conference) may bee farther
manifested by diuers other instances; as
            First, there were 7000. in Elias time, who neuer
bowed their knee to Baal: yet their names cannot be
shewed nor prooued out of good Authors.
            Secondly, there were who opposed corrupt
glosses of the Scribes and Pharises, and
their false doctrine, or at least assented not vnto it,
in the age immediatly before Christs Incarnation:
yet their names cannot bee shewed and proued
out of good Authors.
            Thirdly, the first brocher of the errors touching
the proceeding of the holy Ghost, and Authors
of the schism and rent between the Greek
and Latine Churches, were visible men, yet their
names cannot bee shewed and proued out of
good Authors.
            Fourthly, they who first brought into the
Church the administration of the Sacrament vnder
one kinde onely, were visible men: yet the
names ofGreg de Valent. de legit. vs. Eucharist. them cannot bee shewed nor proued
out of good Authors.
            Fiftly, there were Bishops in almost euerie
Diocess of England &amp; Ireland, and other Countries,
as also Parsons of Parishes, succeeding one
the other for aboue 1000. yeers: yet the names
of such Bishops and Parsons cannot bee shewed
and proued out of good Authors.
            Sixtly, Master Fishers and Master Sweets Ancestors
from Noah, according to the flesh, were
visible men: yet all their names cannot bee

shewed and proued out of good Authors.
            And here the Protestants might iustly call for
names, as the Papists did in the conference when
their Champions were at a fault.
            First, there were a people of Africa, neuer
christned by any proper names. Names, Names,
where are their Names?
            
            Secondly, there was an Author of the Heresie
of the Acephali. Names, Names, where is his
Name?
            
            Thirdly, there were 7000. in Elias time, who
neuer bowed their knees to Baal. Names, Names,
where are their Names?
            
            Fourthly, there were those who opposed the
corrupt glosses of the Scribes and Pharises
in the age before Christs Incarnation. Names,
Names, where are their Names?
            
            Fiftly, there were those that first broached
the error touching the proceeding of the holy
Ghost. Names, Names, where are their Names?
            
            Sixtly, there were those that brought into the
Church the administration of the Sacrament vnder
one kind onely. Names, Names, where are their
Names?
            
            Seuenthly, there were Bishops almost in each
particular Diocesse of England, and Ireland, and
other Countries, as also Parsons of Parishes for
aboue 1000. yeeres. Names, Names, where are their
Names?
            
            Eightthly, M. Fishers and Master Sweets Ancestors,
descended from Noah, were visible men.

               Names, Names: where are their Names?
            
            The third Elencticall or reprehensiue Argument
was implied in D. Featly's challenge to M.
Fisher, to name any City, Town, Village or Hamlet,
where the present Romish faith was taught
for fiue hundred yeers &amp; more next after Christ.
And indeed heer the Title of the Conference
was verified, M. Fisher was caught in his owne Net:
for, in propounding the Question of the Visibility
of the Church in all Ages, he spred a strong
Net (as hee thought) to catch D. White and D.
Featly, in supposing it to be impossible for them
to proue the Visibility of the Protestant Church
in all Ages, especially in the Ages immediatly
going before Luther; but hee was caught in his
owne Net, by being put to proue the Visibility of
the Romish Church for fiue hundred yeers immediately
after Christ. And therefore we turne
his owne Ordnance vpon him, wherewith hee intended
to batter down the walls of our Sion.
            
               
                  The true Church must haue been visible in
all Ages before Luther; yea, so visible, as M.
Fisher pretendeth, that The Names of the Professors
of the faith thereof may be shewed and proued
out of good Authors.
            
            
               The Romish Church hath not been so visible:
            
            
               Therefore the Romish Church is not the
true Church.
            
            The Maior or first Proposition is the Iesuites
owne.
            
               
The Assumption is thus prooued:
            
               No Church, holding the entire doctrine of
the Councell of Tre
                        •
                     t in generall, or the fifteen
Tenets set down in the Conference in particular,
can be shewed for fiue hundred yeers and
more after Christ.
            
            
               But the Romish Church holdeth the doctrine
of the Councell of Trent in generall, and
those fifteen Articles in speciall:
            
            
               Therefore the Romish Church cannot bee
shewed to haue been visible for fiue hundred
yeers after Christ.
            
            And first, that no Church within the space aboue-named,
can bee prooued to haue held the
foresaid Tenets of the present Romish Church,
was proued in the Conference by M. Fisher's silence,
and much more by A. C. his silence in his
Answer to the former Conference. Heer M.
Fisher was as mute as a Fish. Campi

that it is death for him to see him: so wee may
truely say, that M. Fisher was so afraid of the fifteen
Articles mentioned in the Conference, to
bee justified by Antiquity, that it was death to
him to name them. And therefore when hee
comes to that part of the Conference, he passeth

away in an Homericall Cloud, saying, Heer D.
Featly made an insolent Challenge. But A. C. durst
not set down so much as the words of the Challenge
in particular, lest his Catholique Disciples
should be scandalized at it.
            Secondly, the Inuisibility of the Romish
Church, for many hundreds of yeeres after
Christ, may be inferred from the confessions of
our learned Aduersaries. Alfonsus confesseth
for Indulgences; Roffensis, for Purgatory; and
Gregory de Valentia, for Communion vnder one
kinde, that they were no part of the beleefe or
practice of the ancient Church. Verily I beleeue,
Alfonsus à Castro and Roffensis needed a
pardon for so expresly professing the nouelty of
Pardons and Indulgences.L. 8. contr

are many things knowne to later Writers, which

What maruell then, if it so fall out with Indulgences,
that there should be no mention of them

hath been made by some stray Troops,

            A Prooem to the Answer to
the Conference.
            WEE read a pleasant Story in 
                  〈◊〉
               ,
of a fellow, that, beeing somewhat
heauie, took a brasse pot which
hee had in his hand, and put it vnder his head for
a pillow, and so laid him downe to sleepe: but
finding That his pillow some-what vneasie, with
all the wit he had, he rose vp, and filled it full of
feathers and straw within, and thereby thought
he had made it much softer, and took a nap vpon
it. If I should not apply this Story, the intelligent
Reader soon would: You, M. Fisher, are the
man, who finding your former Answers, vpon
which you relyed in the Conference, to bee
very hard, vncouth, and not to be endured; now,
in this your defense of them, you as it were fill
the brasse pot within, with feathers and straw,
that is, stuffe out and bumbaste your former Answers
with verball distinctions, impertinencies,
tautologies, cauils, and vntruthes: for all the
feathers and straw, the pot is brasse still, as
hard as euer it was; and, for all your new qualifications
and falsifications, your former Answers

are as harsh and vnsufferable, as euer before: so
that hee needeth a brow of brasse, that will rest
or rely vpon them. For example:
            1. About the beginning of the Conference,
you were driuen to these Soloecismes in Grammar,
to affirm, that Two vtrums imply not two quaeres;
that whether the Church, &amp;c. and whether the
names, &amp;c. make but one whether; that the Copulatiue
(and) coupleth nothing; that these words
(It is not) in the singular, are to bee referred to
that part of the question, Whether names, &amp;c. in
the plurall. To these absurd paradoxes in Grammar,
Page. 17.against all common sense, you answer, To cut
off all needlesse wrangling about the Aduerb vtrum,
whether, and the Copulati
                     •
                  e et, and, as if Grammarscholars
had been disputing, rather then graue Diuines,
who were not to stand on rigour of Grammar, &amp;c. Belike,
graue Diuines are priuiledged to bee

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , vnlettered, vnchristcrost,
to vtter non-sense, to speake false English
at their pleasure, as the Pope did false Latine,
when he said, Fiatur, for fiat, in contemptum omnium
Grammaticorum. But, as the Romane Grammarian
told the Emperour, who vsed an vncouth word,
Bentius orat.

                  ri posse, verbis
non posse, that it was in the power of the Emperour,
to make men free of the City of Rome, but
not words: so let mee tell you, that the Pope
may dispense with you for breaking the rules of
your order, in so much intermeddling (as you
doe) in ciuil affaires; but hee cannot dispense

with you, for breaking of Grammar Rules▪
               Priscian may lay his action against you in all 
                  〈◊〉
               ,
&amp; there lies no prohibition in a case of this nature.
            2. You were driuen to these Soloecis
                     •
                  es in Logick.
First, In a true Syllogisme to answer to the conclusion:
For which you would haue beene 
                  •
               issed
out of the Schooles in our Vniuersities. Secondly,
distinguish vpon a proposition, and apply the distinction
to no tearm. To the former you answer, Th
                     •
                  
idle exception,Page 24. M. Fisher, attending to the 
                     〈◊〉
                  ,
did not regard; but might haue told him, that it
is not vnusuall, after a distinction made both to Maior
and Minor, to apply the like to the conclusion. It is true,
he might haue said so (as you doe now): but is
that sufficient without farther proofe? Name
the place where it is vsuall. I am sure it is alwaies
improper and needlesse: for the conclusion in disputation,
is alwaies a proposition giuen by the
answerer, to the opponent, to inferre &amp; conclude
it in his argument: and therefore it is alwaies supposed
to bee agreed vpon for the meaning of it,
before it comes to be concluded in a Syllogisme.
The Answerer may alwaies distinguish of
premises, because they are new propositions
not before debated vpon: but the conclusion is
either the originall Thesis it selfe, propounded by
the answerer, (which if it be ambiguous, he ought
to haue explicated it, in setting downe the sta
                  •
               e
of the Question) or it is one of the premises in
the Opponents Syllogisme: in which, if there lay
any ambiguity, the Respondent ought to haue

distinguished vpon it before, when it was
the Maior or Minor proposition; and not, when
being distinguished or denied before by the Respondent,
it is now by the Opponent in a true
Syllogisme made the Conclusion. To the second
you answer:Page. 26. 
               That which D. Featly thinketh to bee a
straine of new Logick, to distinguish vpon a proposition,
without applying the distinction to any particular tearm,
is not so strange as he maketh it. As for example: When
one saith, An Aethiopian is white, neither the tearm
Aethiopian alone, nor the tearme white alone, in it
selfe, needeth distinction, because it is not equiuocall.
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               : What a strange
speech is this? Is not the tearme albus, white,
equiuocall? Doe not almost all later Logicians
giue it, as a most knowne instance of an equiuocall
tearme? Which may bee taken two waies,
either absolutely, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , and in whole, as when
wee say, Nireus is albus, Nireus is a white man,

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ; or 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , secundum
quid, in some respect or part, as when wee say,
Ethiops est albus, a black Moore is white, to weet,
in his teeth. It is true, that as Poyson infecteth the
whole bloud, yet the substance of it lies but in
one principall part: so an equiuocation in any
part of a proposition, in some sort, affecteth the
whole: yet this equiuocation lieth alwaies in
one tearme, to weet, in the subiectum, or praedicatum,
if the proposition bee properly equiuocall;
and in the copula and construction, if it bee properly
amphibologicall: as, A
                     •
                  o te, Aeacida, Romanos

vincere posse:te Roman
                     •
                  s, or Romanos te. But note
M. Fisher (if you knew it not), that one of the
three termini in a Syllogisme, may containe, many
words: neither can you name any ambiguous
Proposition, in which it may not bee shewed,
in which Logick tearme the ambiguity
lyeth.
            3. You were driuen in the Conference to this
Soloecisme in Philosophy, to affirme, That Media
may be said directa, yet not to tend ad directum finem.
Hereto he answers,Page 30. 
               If M. Fisher did say these
words, his meaning may bee gathered out of his former
explication; in which he shewed, how the direct end of
the Disputation was not, to treat of particular controuersies,
but to finde out, first by other meanes, the true
visible Church, whose professors names may be shewed
in all Ages out of good Authors: those Media therefore
Directa, as D. Featly termed them, might in some
sort be so tearmed, as beeing directed by D. Featly, to
his owne end, of transferring the question to particular
Conferences, but not ad directum finem, that is, not ordained
to the direct end of the Disputation, viz. to she
                     •
                  
a visible Church of Protestants in all Ages, whose
names may be shewed out of good Authors. Of the end
of the Dispute, &amp; how my arguments tended directly
to that end, enough hath been said before
in the Remonstrance. But admitting that they tended
not to the direct end, M Fisher should haue
said, Your Media were not Directa, because they
tended not ad directum finem: but he saith, Your
Media were Directa, but not tending ad direct 
                     ••
                  
                  finem;
               
thereby flatly contradicting himselfe in
the same proposition: for, Media, or meanes, are
said in relation to an end; therefore, if they are
direct, they must needs tend to the direct end.
To say, Media are Directa, and not tending ad directum
finem, to the direct end, is all one, as if he
should say, This shoo indeed is fit, but not for the
foot: This is the streight way, but not to the
place you would goe to: The aime is right, but
not to the marke: The saddle serueth fit, but not
to the beasts back: The knife is keen, and sharp,
but not to cut. For, as a shoo is said to be fit onely
in respect of the foote: and the way straight,
in respect of a mans intended iourney: and the

                  •
               ime right, in respect of the marke: and the saddle
to serue fit, in respect of the beasts back, for which
it is made; &amp; the knife keen, in respect of cutting:
so are Media said to be Directa, onely 
                  〈…〉
               .
And therefore I had iust cause then to vse the
English Prouerbe, This is a Bull; and now the
Greeke, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               .
            4. You were driuen to the worst soloecisme
of all in Diuinity, to refuse to answer to
Christ and his Apostles, yea though you were
solemnely adiured thereunto. To this (to 
                  〈◊〉
               
impudent denials &amp; apparant contradiction obserued
by the witnesses in the Attestation) you
answer,Pag. 64. &amp; 65. that You would not permit me to diuert
either to dispute about Christ, or his Apostles,
or any other point, till Names were giuen in all
ages:Pag. 65. 
               for, this had been, say you, to follow two Hares

at once, and so to catch neither. A light Answer,
Master Fisher, to so weightie a Charge. Christ
and his Apostles should not haue been so slightned.
But you say, To instance in Christ and his
Apostles in the first Age, was, To follow two Hares.
Do you remember which was the Hare we were
to hunt? Was it not the Visibility of the Church in
all Ages before Luther? And could a man possibly
take a more direct and orderly way, then to begin
with the first Age, and the first of the first
Age? If this were not the way to catch the Hare,
your owne Hunts-men, that prating 
                  〈◊〉
               ,
and his honest transcriber S. N. were at a great
fault: for, they begin their Catalogue where I
do. Will you not bee angry, Master Fisher, if I
tell you the truth? I hunted not two Hares at
once: but when you were deuising and printing

is not the true visible Church, but rather the contrarie,

are many passages in this Answer; in which,
Master Fishers ingenuity, and sincerity, and modestie,
are set vpon the Last. These commendations
of Master Fisher would haue lost all
their grace in his own mouth, as a Turkeys doth

A. C. well enough, to blazon the Armes

the letters of your friends name, you play fast

bee wise and iudicious, especially if they duely
consider the occasion &amp; state of the question lately treated
(in a Conference betwixt Doctor White, and
Doctor Featly Ministers, and Master Fisher and
Master Sweet Iesuites) will easily discerne (euen by
that false relation which is set out in print by a Protestant)
that the Protestants cause hath not gained
any thing.

In like manner, the Protestant Relator may
checke you: If hee haue done you any wrong
in the relation, or set downe any thing vntruely,
conuince him of it; if not, why doe you smite
him with your tongue and pen? It is your owne
Maxime, that No man will lie for the aduantage of
his Aduersarie; or for his owne disaduantage: but
you here say, that The Protestant cause hath gained
nothing by the relation. Therefore it should seeme,
by your owne argument, to bee a sincere, and
not malicious relation. Howsoeuer, if the Protestant
cause hath gained nothing by it, your
cause hath lost nothing by it; and if so, why do

you so maligne and persecute, euen vnto banishment,
an innocent Relation? Why do you forbid
your Romish Catholiques to reade it? Why
apply you so many salues, both in writing and in
print, if there be no sore? What the Protestant
cause gained by the Conference it selfe, or the relation
thereof, malo in aliorum opinione relinquere,
quàm in oratione mea ponere: it is fitter for me to
heare, then speak. I am sure, Doctor White and
my selfe haue gained much ease by it: for, before
the Conference, wee could neuer bee quiet
for your challenges; but since, wee haue neuer
been troubled with you. It seemes, you had
enough of that short Encounter. But you will
say, No blowe was struck home: no arrow was
drawne vp to the head; no argument prosecuted
to the full, at that Meeting. How then could
the Protestant Cause gaine any thing by it? By
your miserable euasions, and manifest flight and
tergiuersation, you, who were ante pugnam
auidus &amp; tumidus, were in pugnâ pauidus &amp;
timidus: like Captaine Iohn, mentioned by Sinesius,
                  Epist. 104.who in the maine fight, fled amaine, digging
his horse-sides, letting loose the Reanes, laying
on amaine with a switch, &amp;c. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  .
&amp;c. It will be said, If
you fled in such manner, why did not I follow
after you? Because in your flight you brake the
bridge, by refusing to answer Christ and his Apostles.
Scripturis non loquentibus, quis loquetur?
                  
Where Christ and his Apostles cannot be heard,
the holy Father was resolued neuer to speake. I
account it no foile to my cause, to bee non-futed
in that Court, where Christ and his Apostles are
excepted against. Where the Charters of our
saluation are not pleadable, giue mee leaue, M.
Fisher, to speake to you Iesuites in the words of

                     Athanasius de Incar. Christ. Si▪ discipuli est is Scripturarū, per eas nobiscum incedite; si diuersa a Scripturis vultis fabulari, cur nobiscum decortaetis, qui neque loqui neque audire sustinemus, quod extraneum sit ab istis, dicente Domino, Si māseritis in sermone meo, eritis mei Discipuli?Athanasius: If you are the Disciples of the Scriptures,
and Christs scholars, walke with vs by them: if
you wil talk extrauagantly and diuersly from the Scriptures,
why do you contend with vs, who dare not to speak
or heare any thing without them, or different from
them; our Lord saying▪ If you abide in my sayings, you
shall bee my Disciples?
               
            
            
               Master FISHER'S Preface.
               Neuerthelesse, because those who bee partially affected,
or of meane capacity, may (as it is to be doubted
diuers doe) conceiue &amp; speak amisse of this matter, to the
disgrace of the Catholique cause, and the preiudice of
their owne and other mens soules; I have thought is
meet to set out a true relation of the occasion, progresse,
and issue of this Conference; and this in such
sort, as diuers falshoods of the Protestant Relator may be
easily perceiued, and the weaknesse of the Protestant
cause may be euidently discouered: which is also so bad,
as it seemeth it cannot bee supported, but by setting out
such lying relations.
            
            
               The Answer.
               
                  Nescio quo pacto vox tua facta mea est. You haue

said that which I should haue said. When Saint
Hierom iustly taxed Sabinian a Deacon, for deflouring
a Nun, Sabinian reflects vpon Saint Hierom,
and laies foule aspersions of lewdnes vpon
him: but the difference was that which S. Hierom
charged Sabinian with, which was per veram
convictionem, by true conuiction: but that which
Sabinian charged Saint Hierom with, was per falsam
confictionem, by false conifiction, or forged
calumniation. Thus the case stands betweene
the Protestant Relatour and you, Master
Fisher. Hee laies crimen falsi to your charge,
per veram conuictionem, by true conuiction: hee
proues falshood by you, by vnanswerable arguments
drawne from euident circumstances,
and your owne confession, and multitude of
witnesses beyond all exception: see the Attestation.
Whereas you obiect falshood to him,
it is per falsam confictionem: you falsly impose
falshood vpon him: you say, that there is falsehood
in his relation, but you proue no such
thing. Your 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , heere cannot carry it;
first, because the particulars you deny, neerly
touch your credit and reputation: therefore it
stands you vpon,Cic. in Ver. to deny them. Negas haec facta:
turpis enim et periculosa est confessio: you deny matters
of fact alleadged against you in the Conference,
because you cannot with safety or credit
confesse them. Besides this legall exception against
your witnesse in your owne case, you are
a Frier, and therefore (according to the ancient

English Prouerb) a L. with a rime to it. Thirdly,
you are a Iesuite: and therefore (vnlesse you will
swarue from the rule of the prime men &amp; Ring-leaders
of your society) you maintain the wholsome
and profitable vse of an equiuocating Lie.
What doo I or any man knowe, whether, when
you speak of diuerse false-hoods of the Protestant
Relator, you reserue not in your minde,
Fained by me, or deuised by me, to saue my credit, and
promote the Catholique Cause? But let vs see how
you turn the Lie vpon vs.
            
            
               Master FISHER'S Preface.
               The sight and consideration whereof maketh wee
more easily beleeue that to bee true which I haue read,
viz. that A Decree was made by Diuines in Geneua,
defining it lawfull to lie for the honour or credit of the
Gospell; and that, conformably to this Decree, an English
Minister being told, that one of his Pu
                     •
                  -fellows
had made Lies, in stead of Proofs of his Protestant Religion,
did answer, saying, Hee cannot lie too much in
this cause: it must needs be a weak and bad cause, that
needeth to be supported by such weak and bad shifts.
            
            
               Answer.
               I assent to your conclusion: It must needs bee
a false religion, that is supported with such lies as
you haue now heer giuen vs a brace. True Religion
neither is supported by lies, nor any way supports
lies. Let vs see then whether your faith or
ours leanes on these base and beggerly crooches.

Certainely, neither Iacobus de Voragine, nor Surius,
nor Copgraue, nor Turseline, nor any other Author
of your golden Legends, seruing to support
your doctrines of Transubstantiation, Inuocation
of Saints, Worship of Images and Reliques,
Purgatory, and Pilgrimages, &amp;c. can be proued
to be a Protestant. He that wrote Beza's Recantation;
and another, who since set forth the late
Lord Bishop of Londons Legacie, was farre from a
Protestant. Name me any Protestant who euer
defended pias fraudes, or euer propugned this
Tenet, Fides non est seruanda Haereticis, Faith is not
to be kept with Hereticks. The Fathers of the
Councell of Constance, who, contrary to the faith
and safe conduct giuen by the Emperour Sigismund,
burnt Iohn Hus and Hierom of Prague, neuer
learned from the Schoole of Geneua, or the
English Pue you speak of, to break faith for the
maintenance of the Romish-Catholique faith,
and the destruction of the opposers thereof. The
first that brake the Oath of Alleageance in heauen,
was the Diuell; and by it, becam a Diuell:
and the first that brake promise on the earth, was
likewise the Diuell, Gen. 3. whose scholars they
shew themselues, who teach, that Promises euen
confirmed by oathes, the strongest sinewes which
hold all humane society together, may be either
cut asunder by Papall Dispensation, or cunningly
vntied by Iesuiticall Equiuocation. Pray tell
me in good earnest: Sprang the doctrine of Equiuocation
(whereby you defend, that a man

may affirm, nay sweare an vntruth in words, and
make it vp by a mentall reseruation) from vs, or
from you?Heer you haue Names, names of your owne trade, and some of them Wardens of your owne equiuocating Company. I cannot finde either Nanarrus, or
Gregory de Valentia, or Southwell, or Tolet, or Parsons,
among the Catalogue of Protestant Writers.
These vpholders of Equiuocation, and many
other, whose names deserue to be buried in
euerlasting obliuion with the ancient P
                     •
                  iscilianists
(whose old, damnable doctrine touching
the lawfull vse of lying, they refine with a new
Burnish, to make it more saleable), neuer took a
Copie of the supposed Decree of Geneua, nor
gathered Notes from the English Reader you
speak of. No Protestants are so ambitious, as to
steale from your Garlands the fairest Flowres
wherewith you adorne your heads and pens. If
any such Flowres growe in our Gardens, either
they die of themselues, or are carefully weeded
out. I appeal to all the Confessions, Catechisms,
Expositions on the Commandements, Systems
of Diuinity, Common-places, seuerall Tractates,
wherein, either directly and professedly,
or occasionally, they fall on the Subject wee are
now about, whether they condemn not all lying
and false-hood, open or couered, with mentall
reseruation, or without, to the deep pit of hell
from whence they came. From which pit, Iacobus
de Voragine may very well be thought to take
his name, for raking hell for so many lying miracles
and fables, wherewith hee hath stuffed the
liues of Saints. And now hauing laid the Dog

at your doore, let vs see how you beat him from
you, to ours. Your wisdome and graue fatherhood
heer tels vs of a Decree made at Geneua,
you knowe not when; and a tale of a Minister,
you knowe not who; and for proof, are alleaged
Iohannes Cretensis, and Gulielmus Nullatenensis, or
(if you will) Episcopus Chalcedonensis: both these,
if I may take your word (for, I hold neither of
them worth looking into) relate the Stories aboue-mentioned,
and that agreeable to their
names and titles, fide Graeca. A pretty Pageant:
A Iesuite cites a Iesuite against Geneua; and a
Romish Priest, a new no-Bishop of Chalcedon, against
an English Minister. Aruspex Aruspicem:
oneFortune-tellor. Gypsie quotes another for the truth of his
Art. Simia giues his word for Pseudolus. Belial
cites Belzebub the god of Flies, for a Flie-blown
scoffing Iergon at Geneua: There was a decree made,
defining it to be lawfull to lie for the credit and honor of
the Gospell. Where was this Decree or Canon
made? In the Senate, or in the Consistory? By
the Syndicks, or by the Presbyterie? When was
it made? What date beares it? Who drew it?
Who engrossed it? Vpon what occasion was it
made? Who subscribed to it? I cry you mercy:
now I remember when it was made: it was
made the very yeer in which Beza recanted his
Religion: and immediately thereupon, all Geneua
reconciled it selfe to the Pope. And at that
time, the Pope's Holiness, to assure the Geneuians
of his vnfained loue and friendship to their city,

sent them a Copie of the great Charter of Constantines
donation, and in the back-side of it, this
decree was written, at the beginning of the Iulian
period, an. 764. ante orbem conditum. Yea, but some
Papists will say, If this Decree were so ridiculous
a forgery, Father Eudaemon Iohannes would
neuer haue reported it, as he doth, in sober sadnes.
Titus 1. 12Heerunto I answer, first, out of Saint Paul,
that the Cretians are not alwaies the honestest
men: and Father Eudaemon doth not deny nor
belie his Country. Secondly, I answer out of the
Acts of our Courts, and the Proceedings against
Garnet, that this Eudaemon, who takes vpon him
to justifie that Powder-traitor, against most vncontrouleable
Euidence, and the publick justice
of a whole Kingdome, is none of the honestest
among the Cretians. This is that monstrum hominis,
monstrum nominis, Andraeas Iohannes sid
                        •
                     nius
Cretensis. This is the Canonizer of Garnet and his
straw. Father Garnet, forsooth, at his execution
(si credere fas est) let fall some drops of bloud vpon
a straw, which miraculously fashioned themselues
into the shape and Visage of that Powder-martyr:
which is as true, and altogether as likely,
as that the Atomi or motes, such as wee now
see in the Sun, by a casuall concourse, made the
whole world, according to the faith of the antient
Epicures. But the best jest was, that as Garnets
tongue doubled and equiuocated whil'st he was
aliue, so his face equiuocated and doubled after
his death. As in Plautus his Amphitrio, Socis begat

another Socia; and Blepharo, another Blepharo;
and the Goblet, another Goblet; so like, that
they could not be distinguished: in like manner,
face begets face, and miracle begets miracle, and
straw begets straw; representing Garnet's feature;
so like, that without miracle they could not bee
distinguished. Thoughts are free. My conceit
is, that Father Eudaemon, reading Saint Gregorie's
Exposition on those words of Iob, Boues arabant,
&amp; asini pascebant iuxta; the oxen plowed, and the
asses fed by them; and learning, that by oxen were
allegorically meant the Clergie, and by asses, the
Laity, thought he might well defend this strawn
miracle, because straw is fit fodder for asses. For
which his Apologie of Garnet and his straw, as
also his witty inuention of a Decree published at
Geneua, for the lawfulnes of a Lie tending to the
honour and credit of the Gospell, hee meriteth
to haue the first syllable of his name to bee cut
off. As Ieconias is called by the Prophet, Conias:
so Eudaemon should bee called from henceforth,
Diuell Iohn.
                  
                  Daemon Iohannes. And for the Bishop of Chalcedon,
I wish him no other punishment, for his slander
of the English Minister, but to be sent to reside
on his Diocesse. And so I leaue them, and
come to you, M. Fisher.
               
            
            
               Master FISHER'S Preface.
               I for my part will not promise to haue perfectly remembred
and set downe euery word that passed in this
Conference, especially spoke by by-standers, nor to haue

strictly obserued the precise order of euerie passage: but
for the substance and truth of the matter that I doe
relate, I assure, that there shall not bee found any falsehood,
vnlesse it be in some of those parcels which I doe
not relate of my selfe, but out of the Protestant Relator
whose relation ordinarily as I doe not contradict, vnlesse
it bee vpon necessarie occasions, so I doe not intend to
approue. But, simply relating what it saith, I will leaue
is to others to iudge what they thinke fit of it. Onely
this I will say, that euerie one may beleeue it, so farre
as it relateth any thing which may aduantage the Catholique
Defendants and their cause, or disaduanlage
the Protestant Disputants and their cause: for it is certaine,
that no man wil lie for the aduantage of his aduersary,
or his cause, nor his owne disaduantage. But in
such things as it hath set downe aduantageously for the
Protestant Disputant, or his cause, there is iust reason
to suspect it, inregard that I am told, that Doctor
Featly himselfe (who is said to bee the Author) hath
confessed, that more is said in the relation, then was said
in the conference it selfe: and I am sure, something is left
out which was said, and something mis-reported. This
being premised by way of preface, I will begin to discourse
of the matter it selfe.
            
            
               Answer.
               In this part of your Preface, you arrogate
truth to your owne relation, and derogate from
the Protestants: to driue forward your owne
Barke fraught with vntruthes, you fill your sailes
with the breath of your owne praises; assuring

vs, that, for the substance and truth of the matter
that you relate, there shall not bee found any
falsehood. How will you assure this, when so
many persons of qualitie, present at the conference,
and attentiue to it, in diuers particulars
testifie the contrarie vnder their hands? You are
one of the principall Gamesters, Master Fisher;
and your credit, if not your Religion, lies at
stake. Bee not your owne iudge, but let the
standers by determine, whether you or the Protestant
Relator hath plaied faire, and aboue
boord. For omissions, in regard whereof, you
taxe the Protestant relation, they were in your
fauour, and not to your preiudice. But because
you could not see when you were well, and
complaine without a cause, they are now supplied:
make your best of them. For additions or
mis-reports to the preiudice of any, the witnesses
expresly cleere the Protestant Relatour from
any such imputation: and if I should fasten any
such vpon him, as you couertly would insinuate,
essem similis vestri, id est, mendax. If I were the
author of that relation, is it likely, that I would
discredit it my selfe? This were, messes meas
vrere, to blur with my pencill a true Picture
drawne by my selfe. Ita
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      hîc non modò crimen non
haeret, sed nec Iesuit ae cohaeret oratió: as you contradict
the truth, so you contradict your selfe.
               To conclude therefore my Answer to your
Preface, and giue the Reader some light to
cleer his iudgement in censuring both relations,

the ciuill Law teacheth to suppose euerie man honest,
vnlesse the contrary bee proued: and therefore
the Protestant Relator may iustly challenge thy
good opinion, vnlesse thou find some proofe to
the contrary. On the contrary, Qui semel probatur
esse malus, semper supponitur esse malus in eodē genere
mali: whosoeuer hath been once conuinced of a
crime, wheresoeuer afterward hee comes in
question, is presumed alwaies to bee faulty in
the same kind. But you, Master Fisher, were
conuinced to your face by two witnesses, to be
a false Relator and setter downe of some of my
answers in a former conference: neither did
you, or could you deny it: onely you blanched
it ouer with protesting, that you did it not wittingly
or willingly: from which starting hole you were
driuen by Doctor Goad, and you haue here giuen
mee a staffe to beat you out of it: for, you say, It
is certaine, that No man will lye, but for his owne
aduantage: but you lied, as is confessed, in setting
downe and relating some of my answers,
and therefore, by your owne argument, you
must needs doe it for your owne aduantage; and
consequently, both wittingly and willingly.
            
         
         
            
               
               A Table of the principall matters
contained in M. FISHER'S
ANSWER.
               MAster Fisher, before you embarked your
selfe into the maine businesse, to answer
the three Chapters of the Protestant
Relation, I expected, that, for the better direction
of the Reader, you would haue some way analyzed
your prolix Answer, and set before him
a Synopsis, or Table of the specialties comprised
is this your Treatise: which thing, because you
haue omitted, I will doe you the courtesie to performe
it for you.
               The principall matters conteyned in the Answer,
may be reduced to fiue heads:
               
                  1. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , or Vntruths.

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , or Contradictions.
                  3.

                   or Vntruths, reade
Title-page; An Answer written by A. C. VNTRVTH:

for, M. Fisher is knowne to bee the
Author of it.
               
                  Preface, Page 2. D. Featly, who is said to bee
the Author, hath confessed, that more is said in the
Relation, then was said in the Conference it self. Vntruth:
for, D. Featly was neuer questioned
about that Relation, nor said hee any such
thing.
               
               Page 15. Then D. Featly, beginning to argue in
this place, and not in the end of the Disputation, where
the Protestant Relator placeth it, did say, I wish 
                        〈◊〉
                     
I warne, I command, I coniure you to answer truely 
                        •
                     d
sincerely in the sight of God, and as you will answer it
at the day of Iudgement. A double Vntruth. First,
the words, I warne, I command, were neuer spoken
by me. Secondly, those words, As you will
answer it at the day of Iudgement, were spoken in the
end of the Disputation, and not in the beginning,
where you place it. See the Attestation to the
Conference. In the same page, M. Sweet propounded
these conditions to bee obserued; First, that all
bitter speeches should be forborne. Secondly, that 
                        ••
                     
                     thing
should bee spoken or heard, but to the purpose.
Vntruth. The second condition was neuer propounded
by M. Sweet; which I thus prooue.
Both Relations agree, that M. Sweet propounded
but two conditions in all; likewise both
agree, that the first condition was, That all bitter
speeches should bee auoyded. There remaines then
but one condition. But all the witnesses, who
haue subscribed to the Conference, doe, vpon

their certaine knowledge, remember, that M.
Sweet propounded such a condition; that None
but Disputants should speak. And therefore this second
condition added by M. Fisher, that nothing
should be spoken or heard, but to the purpose, is feigned
and supposititious.
               Page 16. M. Sweet did not say, as the Relator reporteth;
They are Scholasticall points, not fundamentall:
neither was there any such Syllogisme then made,
as the Relator annexeth. Double Vntruth. Wee
haue as many witnesses, both of that Answer of
M. Sweet, and D. Whites Syllogisme, made by
way of Reply, as there are words in both. In the
same page: In the meane while, name but one Father,
one writter of note, who held the particulars aboue-named,
for 500 yeeres after Christ. To which instant demand
of D. Featly (saith the Relator) nothing was answered:
but neither was this said, neither was it needfull
to answer. Vntruth: for, the witnesses to
the Conference, perfectly remember, &amp; directly
affirme, that it was said. Besides, this I spake
out of my paper, which I haue yet to shew: and
no one thing more mooued M. Bugges, and some
other in the Conference, then this, that for all
the Iesuites laying claime to all Ages, &amp; boasting,
that all the world was of the Popish Religion before
Luther, yet M. Fisher could not name so
much as one man in the world, who for 500 yeers
after Christ, held the Tridentine faith ingenerall,
or those points of Popery, mentioned in
the Conference, in speciall; neither doth hee

yet name one in his printed Answer. Nay, hee
dares not so much as name the points, for feare of
giuing scandall to his owne side.
               Page 20. These formall words which he reporteth
M. Fisher to haue said, viz. A proofe à postetiori, is
more demonstratiue, then à priori, M. Fishér did not
speake. Vntruth: For, first the witnesses to the
Conference remember perfectly, that he said so.
Secondly, M. Alesburie, the Writer of the Conference,
set downe these formall words, which
are yet to be seene in the sealed Schedule. Thirdly,
M. Alesburie immediately replyed vpon M.
Fishers words, Heere M. Fisher sheweth his Academicall
learning, in preferring a demonstration à posteriori,
before that which proceedeth à priori. These
words of M. Alesburie are set downe in the Protestants
Relation of the Conference, and M.
Fisher doth not deny them: and therefore he cannot
deny those words which were the immediate
occasion of that Reply.
               Page 31. But D. Featly did not say all this. Vntruth:
for, immediately vpon those words of
mine, that the Inference of the effect by the
cause, was not transitio à genere in genus, &amp;c. D.
Goad interposed, saying; M. Sweet, You ones learned
better Logick in Cambridge, then you shew now.
These words of D. Goad, set downe in the Protestants
Relation, M. Fisher heere denieth not:
and therefore hee cannot reasonably deny the
former words of mine which occasioned them.
Remember, M. Fisher, better your lesson; Mandecem
oportet, &amp;c.
               
               
                  
Page 32. But D. White did not speak thus; neither
did he, in all the conference, make any such long
discourse. Vntruth: for, first, D. White was appointed,
in the beginning of the Conference,
for the last houre and half to answer M. Fisher in
the contrary Question, for the Visibility of the
Roman Church. The first houre and half was
already spent: and therefore D. White had iust
occasion and reason to call vpon M. Fisher as hee
did, to prooue the Visibility of the Romane
Church: And as for the six points mentioned in
the Conference, they were the same which D.
White shewed Sir Humfrey Linde and mee before
the Conference, and told vs, that he would put
M. Fisher vpon the proofe of them. Secondly,
those of the Auditors which sate and stood next
about D. White, testifie vpon their perfect remembrance,
that he called vpon M. Fisher to oppose,
and propounded those six points vnto him, set
downe in the Conference. In which, because M.
Fisher found himself vnable to deal with Doctor
White, therefore he makes bold to borrow a point
of Iesuiticall honesty; Fairly to deny, that any
such points were proposed.
               
                  Page 35. M. Fisher solemnly protested vpon his
conscience, that wittingly and willingly hee did neuer
wrong either D. White, or D. Featly, in report of any
conference. To this, nothing was replied: and therefore
I suppose, that the Audience was well satisfied of
M. Fisher's sincerity in his relation. Vntruth: for,
D. Goad immediately replied, that what M. Fisher

                  wrote, was for his owne aduantage: and therefore
he could not but suspect, that he did it wittingly
and willingly. See the Attestation to the
Conference.
               
               
                  Page 37. D. Featly, turning to M. Fisher, said,
Will you dispute vpon Christ and his Apostles, or not?
To which M. Fisher said, I will, if you will stay: and,
stretching out his hand, he took D. Featly by his arme
offering to stay him; yet he (D. Featly) in that abrupt
manner went away. Vntruth. So many words,
almost so many vntruthes; and, God be thanked,
there are witnesses enow to conuince the Counter-relator
of a fignall and transcendent leasing
in this last passage. See the Attestation.
               
               I might furnish this Head and common place
of M. Fisher, with many more instances; but
these may suffice, to prooue, that M. Fisher deemeth
himself one of those that haue past Thyle;

this Question be grounded vpon vncertain and
false Supposals: For, a Church may haue been visible,
yet not the Names of all visible Professors thereof now
to be shewed, &amp;c. And again, page 32. Are all visible
Names vpon Record? Are all Records in former
times now to bee produced? And again in the same
page, M. Sweet, calling for Names of Protestants,

well might say, If Protestants had been in all Ages,
their Names in euery Age might bee produced: vnto
which, as the Protestant Relator saith (and the Counter-Relator
denieth not), D. Featly replied, saying,
This is a non sequitur. And page 19. he propoundeth
my Argument thus: That Church which holdeth
this faith you beleeue (not we), shall be so visible,
that the Names thereof may be shewed in all Ages. But
the Protestant Church holdeth this faith:See the Protestant Relation of the Conference, page 21. line 23. 
                  Ergo. And
again in repeating the like argument, That Church
whose faith is the Catholique and Primitiue faith, once
giuen to the Saints, is so visible, that the Names of the
Professors thereof may be shewed in all Ages. To this
Maior Proposition I added, page 21. The Maior
is ex concessis: neither doth the Counter-Relator
deny, that these words were added. Yet page
49. M. Fisher, in his Letter to the Earle of Warwick,
saith, They are so farre from hauing discharged
themselues of the great enterprize they vndertook, as
they stand more engaged than before; hauing now professed
and acknowledged, that the true Church, or (to
vse their owne words) the Church which is so visible
as the Catholique Church ought to bee, is able to name
Professors in all Ages.
               
                  CONTRADICTION.
                  Doctor Featly professeth &amp; acknowledgeth,
Contradiction the first.that The true Church ought to be so visible,
as that it is able to name professors in all
ages.
                  Doctor Featly holdeth not, that The true

Church ought to be so visible, &amp;c. but disputed
ad hominem, and ex concessis aduersarij, not
according to his owne iudgement.
                  
                     Page 32. M. Fisher had no reason to diuert to particular
matters, in regard it was his Aduersaries fault,
to spend so long time in impertinent Syllogismes. And
page 48. Your Lordship may remember the substance
of all the proof to haue consisted in this, that The true
Church ought alwaies to be so visible, as the Professors
thereof in all Ages might be named. But the Protestants
was the true Church. We refused to dispute of the Minor,
because it transferred the Question. And in many

                  CONTRADICTION.
                  In the Question touching the Visibility
of the true Church, it is impertinent, and a
diuersion, to dispute of the true faith.

Master Fisher, saying, Will you dispute vpon Christ
and his Apostles, or no? To which Master Fisher said,
I will, if you will stay; And in the same page, Master
Fisher did not prohibit him (Doctor Featly) to begin
with the names of Christ and his Apostles. And againe:
M. Fisher expressed his yeelding to dispute about Christ
and his Apostles two seuerall times; once thus: I will
dispute of them in due place. Another time thus: I wil, if
you wil stay. Yet Pag. 64. he writeth thus, M. Fisher
and M. Sweet still kept the Aduersary to the point,
and would not permit him to diuert, either to dispute
about Christ and his Apostles, or any other point, vntill
names were giuen in all ages; The which course they
tooke vpon iust and good reason. And Pag 65. hee
alleadgeth two reasons for it. See them there.
And Page 71. M. Fisher had good reason and right to
deferre disputing with him (D. Featly) out of Scripture,
of Christ and his Apostles, vntill he had made his
full induction of names.
               
               
                  CONTRADICTION.
                  Master Fisher permitted Doctor Featly to dispute
about Christ and his Apostles.
                        
                           〈…〉

to dispute about Christ and his Apostles.
                  
                     
Master Fisher expresly yeelded, that D.

nor dispute about them, nor any other point,
vntill names were giuen in all ages.
                  A curious eye might easily discerne many
more contradictions in this Answer of Master
Fisher: but these may suffice to veri
                        •
                     ie the truth
of that obseruation, or, to speake more properly,
that obseruation of the truth, to wit, that she
vsually taketh this reuenge of her aduersaries,
that they who contradict her in the beginning,
contradict themselues before the end: for
truthes are alwaies concords, but false-hoods
are very often discords, euen among themselues.

added a second whether: therfore it could bee
no irremissible sinne in the Scribe, or rather
the Printer, to distinguish the parts of the
question really and verbally diuers, by prefixing
the figure 2. to the latter part of it. Is not
this to fish for Banstikles? If you catch no

shall be called no more Master Fisher, but Master

Piere Daubignie, the French Iesuite of your
Order, thanked God, that hee had a singular gift
of forgetfulnesse; that, what hee heard in confession,
it presently ran out of his memory. This
gift of forgetfulnes is not now so rare; therefore
you might haue spared this obseruation: howbeit,
if my memory had been so short and sandy,
that I was not able to commit a doozen lines, or
thereabouts, to memory (if I had intended it),
they were very much too blame, that made
choise of mee, first at Oxford, and afterwards at
London, to preach the rehearsall Sermons. A very

haue a purpose, M. Fisher, to cauill: you know my
meaning well enough, by the tearm perpetuall;
to weet, That Christian faith which hath continued
from Christs first publishing it, and shall
still continue vntill his second comming. You
reply: If this were said by D. Featly, hee should haue
considered, how hee and D. White cauilled vpon the
word, Whether and And, when they knew M. Fisher's
meaning well enough; yea, after they had heard him
plainely explicate his meaning: whereas M. Fisher onely
put them in minde to speake properly like Schollers,
and did not cauill or reply, after that D. Featly did explicate
his meaning. Chius ad Choum. Is it all one
to expound a tearm, &amp; to confound two distinct

Questions? to explicate in what sense a man taketh
an ambiguous word, and to speake perfect
See the introduction to the defence.non-sense? to speak as ordinary men speak, and
to speak as no man speakes? I called faith eternall
in that sense, as the Apostle calleth 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,
the eternall-couenant, Heb. 13. and as Saint 
                     〈◊〉
                  
calleth the eternall Gospell, Apocal. 14. and
as Tully prooueth the soules to be eternall, in his
Tusc. Quest. And will you say, that none of these
spake properly or like Schollers? Yet lest you should
happely mistake aeternum, for, ab aeterno, I added to
the word eternall, perpetuall; most plainely to
explicate my meaning. And therefore your exception
at the word eternall, thus expounded,
could be nothing but a meere Cauill; which you
your selfe perceiuing, in your later thoughts you
help the matter, after your manner, with a mentall
reseruation, otherwise called, a lie; saying,
page 18: To this M. Fisher answered, first, excepting
against the word eternall, saying; Faith is not eternall,
or ab aeterno. Which words, ab aeterno, were indeed
ab externe; strangers, new thrust into the
Conference. Neither did I in my Argument▪
nor you in your Answer, vse those words 
                     〈◊〉

viz.

Church, by M. Fisher, is pretended to be.
               
                  
But the faith of the Protestant Church is eternall,
perpetuall, and vnchanged:
               
                  Ergo, The Protestant Church is so visible as
the Catholique Church ought to bee, and
the Popish Church is pretended by M. Fisher
to bee:
               You answer, That the Maior is not vniuersally
true, for that there may be a Church or company, who
may haue inward faith, eternall and vnchanged: As
for example, A Church of Angels, who, for want of visible
professors, are not so visible as the Catholique
Church ought to be. Quid ad Rombum? What is
this instance to the purpose? I dispute of the
Church on earth: you answer of the Church in
heauen. I dispute of faith: you answer of vision.
I dispute of a Church succeeding in all Ages:
you answer of a Church, in which there is no
succeeding, nor Ages. I dispute of a Church visible
in all Ages: you answer of a Church visible
in no Age. I dispute of noble Confessors &amp; Martyrs,
who haue sealed the profession of the
Christian faith with their bloud: you answer of
immortall Spirits. In a word, I dispute of men,
named in good Authors, and Histories: you answer
of Angels, whose names are written in heauen,
and were neuer vpon visible Record, except
two or three named in the Scriptures.
               Page 31. To those words of mine, I neuer heard
that the inference of the effect by the cause, was transitio
à genere in genus: such was my Argument; for
faith in a beleeuer, produceth profession and confession

thereof; You reply, That M. Sweet's Logick is
not lesse to bee esteemed, if hee had tearmed that

(to weet, proouing the effect by the cause) transitio
à genere in genus: for, a cause as a cause, an effect

and besides, a proofe à priori and à posteriori,
are diuers kindes of proofes.
               
               
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : I dispute of a transition à



genere in genus, in rebus: you answer of a transition
in notionibus. I speake of a straying from the subject
of the Question: you answer of passing
through diuers heads of Logick in proouing. I
speake of genus in Scientijs: you answer of

Law, of speaking nothing but to the purpose.

the mark, reading M. Sweets Law without
it, thus: Item 2. That nothing should be spoken to the
purpose. Euery Puney in Logick can tell you,
that the meaning of transitio à genere in genus, is
the proouing of a conclusion in one science, by
the principles of another distinct from it; and no
way subalternall to it: As for example, To demonstrate
a conclusion in Physick, by principles
in Geometrie; or to demonstrate a conclusion in
naturall Philosophy, out of a principle or principles
in Morall Philosophy. But if your interpretation
of transitio à genere in genus, should
stand, euery demonstration of the effect by the
cause, à priori, or of the cause by the effect, 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      posteriori,
                  
in the same Science; should bee a transitio à
genere in genus, because, as you say, the cause as
a cause, and the effect as an effect, differ genere:
for which ignorant Arguing, as M. Sweet was
prickt by D. Goad in the Conference, so you, M.
Fisher, for your more ignorant and grosse defence
of it, deserue to be sent to fustitudinas ferricrepinas
Insulas, vbi viuos homines mortui incursant boues.
               
               Page 65. You alledge this for a reason, why
you refused to answer Christ &amp; his Apostles, for
that (say you) All disputation about particulars, before
the true Church were, by her perpetuall Visibility,
or some such euident marke found out and knowne,
would haue beene fruitlesse and endlesse which was the
reason why M. Fisher in another former conference,
had with a certaine Minister, would not enter into any
particulars, vntill he had asked these generall Questions:
First, what ground the Minister would stand vpon,
&amp;c? 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ? Heer you bring-in,
by the head and eares, a Conference of yours
with a worthy Minister, and an acute Disputant,
touching the merit of works. What is this
to the Visibility of the Protestant Church, or a
Catalogue of Names? If this bee not transitio à
genere in genus, I am sure it is transitio à Quaestione
in Quaestionem, a vagring from one Question to
another sufficiently distant; neither was there any
cause at all giuen you of this digression: for,
I drew you not to dispute about any particulars,
but proceeded to prooue the generall Question
proposed by your self, to weet, that The Protestant

Church was so visible in the first Age, that
the Names of those that taught the Protestant
faith, might be produced; viz. Christ, his twelue
Apostles, Saint Paul and Ignatius: to whom after
you had giuen your Answer, Whether they
taught our faith or yours, I would haue gone on,
in like manner, in naming the Professors of the
Protestant faith in all Ages. Now then, let the
Reader iudge, whether this your digression into
a long tale of a conference of yours with a Minister
touching merits, were any way necessary or
pertinent.
               Page 68. 69, 70. You alleage many Sayings
out of Tertullian's golden Book of Prescriptions,
to prooue, that Hereticks, who reiected the authority
of the Apostolicall and Mother Churches,
and refused also some Scriptures, or peruerted
the Text by additions and detractions,
should not be admitted to dispute with Orthodoxall
Christians out of Scriptures: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  .
The sentences indeed you cite, are golden,
but you apply them most leadenly: for,
what Protestant (whom, by a ridiculous 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                  principij, or begging the Question, you stile Hereticks),
what Protestant (I say) euer reiected
the authority of the Apostolicall or Mother Churches,
as they were in the Primitiue Times; much
lesse, either refused or peruerted any part of parcell
of the Canonicall Scriptures, by addition
or detraction? Wee attribute much more to the
holy Scriptures, and the ancient Mother-church

(of which, Tertullian speaks), who receiued the
Originall of Scriptures from the Authors themselues,
then you do: we willingly put our whole
cause in their hands: wee renounce any Article
of faith which cannot be prooued to haue been
held by the Apostles and their heires, Tertullian
speaks of. Prooue, that the Apostles, or the Primitiue
Churches immediatly founded by them,
held your Trent-faith, or those twelue new Articles
added by Pope Piu
                        •
                     
                   in the end of that
Councell, and imposed vpon all Professors to
sweare vnto; and then I will acknowledge, that
the Romane Church hath a good title to the
Scriptures. And if we prooue not; that we hold
the ancient Primitiue faith, wee will acknowledge,
that we haue no right vnto them, nor will
we desire to be admitted to dispute out of them.
Therefore vntill M. Fisher or some other, shall
prooue by some other marks, than bare alleaging
of the Popes names locally succeeding one another
in the Sea of Rome, that they are the heires
of the Apostles, we haue a most iust cause to try
the title of the true Church with them, and
bring the last Will and Testament of our Lord
and Master, for our prime Euidence and surest
Deed, to make good our plea.

eloquence, bequeathed to you as a Legacy in

               Protestant Relation.
               EDVVARD BVGS, Esquire, about
the age of 70. yeers, being lately sick,
was sollicited by some Papists then
about him, to forsake the protestant faith,
telling him, There was no hope of saluation
without the Church; There was no Catholike
Church, but theirs.
               
            
            
               Master FIHSER's Answer.
               How farre this parcell of the relation is true or false;
I will not stand to discusse, as not yet knowing how, or
by whom the afore-said Gentle-man came first to doubt
of his Church, and consequently of his religion, &amp;c.
            
            
               Doctor FEATLYE's Reply.
               Although I might take occasion by the counter-relation
of the occasion of this conference, to
reueale diuers mysteries of the reserued Art of
Iesuitical frauds &amp; falsehoods (for as they say in a
Lamprey, so in this whole treatise frō the beginning
to the ending there is a string of poyson;
throughout) yet because the occasiō of the conference
but little concernes the cause, &amp; less me,

in sparing the Iesuites blame, and penance, I will
spare mine owne paines, and the Readers 
                     〈◊〉

who (I perswade my selfe) will not much

wee acquitted our selues vpon the place, for the

               COncerning the occasion of the
Conference, I a
                  •
               ow, that (according
to his Maiesties command)
I did set downe the
truth of the occasion briefely and faithfully,
to my best remembrance, as is alreadie
extant in print. And whereas (fol.
4.) Master Fisher saith, hee set downe two
questions with my consent, and the old Gentlemans;
the first whereof being allowed by both
of vs, Master Fisher wrote, It is granted; I
affirme, that in processe of discourse, I
then allowed, that the Church is more or
lesse visible at all times: but, that I did
grant a necessity of such visibilitie as hee
intendeth, or that I obserued what M.

               Fishers marginall note was, I vtterly denie.
And wheras (page 12.) Master Fisher
complaineth of the inequalitie of the Auditorie,
compared with the few which Master
Fisher brought: To this I say, that, vpon
my credit, I did not acquaint four persons
with the meeting, more then those that I
inuited to dinner. Howsoeuer, I doubt
not, but that hee is rather glad he had no
more Auditours of his owne side; and
by this time, is more asham'd of his cause,
then of the paucitie of his parties th
                  •
               re
present. And yet I will let him know (for
the small acquaintance I haue among the
Papists) I was able to number full twentie
of that side present. And verily, had I
purposedly drawn thither so much company,
the Iesuites ought me thanks for it,
as therein deseruing well of the Catholique
cause, by bringing a troup of spectators,
to view the foyle of our own side, in
a question reputed by the Iesuites so disaduantageous
to vs: wherin, forsooth, the
Protestants (as is triumphed, page 33.)
are so farre from being able to produce three
professors in euerie age, t
                     •
                  at they are not able

to name one; to say nothing of Christ and
his Apostles (for, they were not worthy
to bee answered) not one Author; no
not one Actor that dares oppose two
such learned Iesuites in such a triall. Again
(page 16.) whereas it is said, there was
an vnseasonable motion made by Sir
Humfrey Linde to Master Sweet; I answer,
that I was induced for certaine reasons,
then to mooue Master Sweet to dispute
vpon Transubstantiation. First, the standers
by did well perceyue, that the old
man Master Fisher was much woorried,
and the Auditory much wearied with his
saying nothing, and writing little to the
purpose. Secondly, a Romified Lady being
present, and being troubled with those
dull and weake answers, did then intreat
me to interpose, and dispute of Transubstantiation
for her instruction. And lastly,
I adde, that I had proposed this question
to Master Sweet at my house, 8. weekes
before, where his leasure then would not
giue him leaue to dispute of it: and now I
conceiued, he was wel armed for a second
encounter. Againe, where it is related

in the Conference, that I told M. Buggs,
that the Church was in Christ and his Apostles,
&amp;c. The Iesuite saith in the margent
there,A weaker Refutation, as is shewed in the insuing Discourse. 
               A very weake and insufficient
answer, as is shewed hereafter. Surely
the Iesuite had a weake memorie,
and forgot a farther Reply; or else
other answer hee could not make to disproue
it. Neither, by Master Fishers leaue,
was it so weake and insufficient an answer
as hee gaue me, when, vpon his first
meeting, falling into conference about
the Reall presence, which Master Fisher
would prooue out of these words, Hot est
corpus meū; I answerd, that Scotus, &amp; Cameracensis,
and Bellarmine, were of opinion,
that that Text was not strong enough to
enforce Transubstantiation. To which
obiection, hee gaue this Answer as a full
satisfaction to the standers-by: What care
I for Bellarmine, or Scotus, or Cameracensis?
Againe, by Master Sweets leaue, it was
not so weake and insufficient an answer,
as when I propounded to him foure
questions, viz. The worship of Images,
Praier in an vnknowne tongue, Communion

in one kinde, and Transubstantiation;
with this assurance, in the presence
of Recusants, that if he could proue
either all, or but any one of those, held by
the ancient Fathers in the Primitiue
Church, according to that forme of doctrine
prescribed in the Councel of Trent;
I would then subscribe to Popery. All
his answer was, that hee brought a booke
that would proue them all. So for that time I
was content, hee should bee saued by his
booke. But Doctor Featly (in whose hands
hee is now) will not let him escape so
easily; but, calling him into the inner
barre, will finde, that non legit vt Clericus.
At that time Master Sweet farther added,
that hee for his part had other businesse,
and could not intend to argue with mee
about those questions. If his superior had
heard him, certainly hee would haue enioyned
him penance, for neglecting so
fai
                  •
               e an opportunitie of conuerting such
an Hereticke as hee takes mee to bee: hee
knowes, there ought to bee no businesse
pretended, where there had been a possibility
to make a proselyte.
            
               
               Lastly, concerning the issue of the
Conference, I auow and protest, that old
Master Bugs came then to me, and gaue
mee thankes in the same roome before
his departure, and told mee, that he well
perceiued, it was be the great brags of the aduersaries
for their Church; that hee well perceiued,
they could say but little for it: and
withall, hee did acknowledge himselfe to bee
so well satisfied at that time, that he professed
vnto mee, that if his sonne would not leaue
his religion, and the priests company, he would
leaue him, &amp;c.

               The Protestant Relation.
               Paragraph the first, touching the
entry into the Conference.
               DOctor White, and D. Featly, beeing
inuited to dinner by Sir Humfrey
Lynde, and staying awhile after,
had notice giuen them, that M. Fisher and
M. Sweet, Iesuites, were in the next room,
ready to conferre with them touching
a Question set downe by M. Fisher,
vnder his owne hand, in these words,
viz.
               
               First, Whether the Protestant Church was
in all Ages visible, and especially in the Ages
going before Luther; and secondly, Whether
the names of such visible Protestants in
all Ages can be shewed and prooued out of good
Authors.
               This Question beeing deliuered to
the parties aboue-named, and it beeing

notified vnto them, that there were certaine
persons who had beene sollicited,
and (remaining doubtfull in Religion)
desired satisfaction, especially in this
point, they were perswaded to haue
some speech with the Iesuites touching
this point; the rather; because the Priests
and Iesuites doe daily cast out papers, and
disperse them in secret: in which they
vaunt, that no Protestant Minister dare
encounter them in this point.
            
            
               Master Fisher his Answer.
               First, any man reading this parcel, would be induced to
think, that D. White &amp; D. Featly had neuer had notice
before, for what end they were inuited to dinner, or for
what end they were to meete with the Iesuites; but that
they were on the sudden summ
                     •
                  ned to this Conference,
without any preparation, or knowledge of the Question:
which not to be so, is euidently conuinced, partly, by that
which is already said, partly▪ by that which I am after to
say.
               Secondly, this Relator would make his Reader beleeue
that M. Fisher, vnder his owne hand, had set downe
the words of the Question, distinguished with the expresse
figure of 2. which is not so: for M. Fisher did not
write any such figure of 2. in the middle of the Question,
nor did not meane to make any more then 
                     〈◊〉
                   onely

entire Question, as Sir Humfrey himselfe had desired.
               Thirdly, he seemeth willing to perswade, that Priests
and Iesuites doe daily cast out papers: which is not
true.
            
            
               Doctor Featly his Reply.
               The Heathen accounted it an ominous thing,
offendere in limine, to stumble as a man is going out
a-doores, in lifting his legge ouer the threshold. You do
so, M. Fisher: you stumble at the first setting your
foote out a-doore, and (which is farre worse)
you stumble at three strawes.
               The first is, that (forsooth) any man reading this
parcell, would beleeue, that D. White and my selfe
were on the sudden summoned to this Conference.
And what if he should beleeue so? What
doth this aduātage our cause, or preiudice yours?
It matters not much, how wee came to this encounter,
but how we came off. Yet are there no
words in the Relation, which imply any such
thing, that wee came sudden or vnprouided;
nay, whosoeuer reades the first Chapter, touching
the occasion of the Conference, cannot but
perceiue that wee had notice of it before, and
came prouided. The truth is, for mine owne
part, I knew of it two daies, and no more, before
the meeting; and I excepted against the day appointed,
as beeing too neere, and sudden, for a
man to prepare, either to oppose or answer in so

spacious and

yeelded.
               The second straw you stumbled at, is, That
the Relator would make the Reader beleeue, that
M. Fisher put a figure of 2. at the second part of
his Question. And what if the Reader did so beleeue?
It is certaine, that there is a second

in your Question. And what 
                     〈◊〉
                   then
had it beene, to set before the second Vtrum, the
figure 2 ? Howsoeuer, there was no fault in
the Protestant Rela

                  our, but in the Printer,
who mistooke the interrogatiue point in the
copy (?) for the figure 2. In the originall written
Relation, there was no such figure infarced. The
Printers tripping is not to be taken for a stumble
of the Relators: nay, it is rather maruelled, that
he tripped no more, beeing so hastie to

                  nd. And to thrust out a Relation
without direction &amp; authority of the like stamp,
is that error of the Printer, Page 20. line 6.

                     ,
Where are your names? D. White said, This is nothing
but apparant tergiuersation, &amp;c. The shallow
Printer, not vnderstanding this passage, inuerted
the sentence thus: D. White said, Where are your
names? and thereby wholly peruerted the sence,
D. White called not for names, but

stand.
               The third straw you stumble at, is, That the
Protestant Relator seemeth to say, that the
Priests and Iesuites cast out papers, &amp;c. You say
this is not true, and yet you your selfe here mention
three such papers scattered by you; and I
haue receiued a fourth, written by your man; and
Sir Hamfrey Lynde hath seene a fift; and M. Walker
&amp; M. Rogers, a sixt and seuenth. Whereunto also
they haue returned Answers; the one in print,
the other in written hand. Let the Reader then
iudge, whether the Protestant Relator any way
ouerlashed, in charging you with the dis-spreading
of such papers.

the state of the Question to
bee disputed of.
               At the beginning of this Meeting, when
the Disputants were set; D. Featly drew
out the paper, in which the Question aboue-rehearsed
was written, with the
words in the Margent, viz. I will answer,
that it was not; and demanded of M. Fisher,
whether this were his owne hand: which

               Paragraph the third, touching
the conditions to bee obserued
by the Disputants.
               M. Sweet. Before you proceed to dispute,
desire, these conditions may be assented 
                     〈◊〉
                  
on both sides;
               
                  
First, that All bitter speeches bee forborn;
Secondly, that None speak, but Disputants.
            
            
               Master FISHER.
               About this time, M. Sweet propounded these conditions
to be obserued.
               First, That all bitter speeches should be for borne.
               Secondly, That nothing should be spoken or heard, 
                     •
                  ut

impertinent digressions.
            
            
               Doctor FEATLY.
               This second condition was not propounded
by M. Sweet at the Conference, as is prooued
in the Attestation, page 40. but is since deuised
by M. Fisher, to set a faire Glosse, and colour
on his and M. Sweet's miserable shifts and euasions:
responsum nullum dant praeter vnicum, quod semper
dant nihil ad propositum: whatsoeuer they are
not able to answer to, that is with them nothing
to the purpose. To the instance in fifteene nouelties
of the Romish faith, M. Sweet answered, as
you report, page 16. that Those things were
then impertinent, and nothing to the purpose. To
Sir Humfrey Lynde's motion to M. Sweet, to dispute
of Transubstantiation out of Saint Austen,
M. Sweet answered, That is not now to the Question.
To my proofe a priori, of the Visibility

of the Protestant Church. M. Sweet answereth,
page 19. That is not to the Question: you
ought to prooue the truth of your Church, à posteriori.
That is to the Question. To giue some relish and
taste to these vnsauory Answers of M. Sweet's,
You faine a Prouiso of his, which indeede is a Procudo
of your owne; That M. Sweet answered this
according to law, for there was a Law (forsooth)
made, That nothing should be spoken or heard,
but to the purpose How those things aboue-al-leadged,
were to the purpose, and touched the

               Paragraph the fourth, touching
the Inuisibility of the Romish
Church for more than
500 yeeres after Christ.
               Before I propound my Argument, I
craue leaue in few words to lay open the
vanity of the vsuall discourse, wherewith

you draw and delude many of the Ignorant
and Vnlearned. You beare them in
hand, that there was no such thing in the
world as a Protestant, before Luther; and
that all the world beleeued as you doo;
               That your Church hath not been onely
visible in all Ages, and all times, but eminently
conspicuous and illustrious. Which
is such a notorious vntruth, that I heer offer,
before all this Company, to yeeld you
the better, and acknowledge my selfe ouercomne,
if you can produce out of good
Authors (I will not say, any Empire or
Kingdome, but) any City, Parish or Hamlet,
within fiue hundred yeers next after
Christ, in which there was any visible assembly
of Christians to be named, maintaining
and defending either your Trent-Creed
in generall, or these points of Popery
in speciall;
               That there is a Treasury of Saints merits,
and superaboundant satisfactions at
the Pope's disposing;
               That the Laity are not commanded by
Christ's Institution, to receiue the Sacrament
of the Lord's Supper in both kinds,
&amp;c.

then to answer them, yet certainly it is now most
needfull. If you mean not to answer them, at least
repeat them. This you dare not doo, for feare
your disciples should take offence. You dare not
pull away the curtain, lest your nakednes should
be seen. You are wise in your owne generation: you
knowe how to keep those in the dungeon, whom
you hould in captiuity. They must not see a
glimpse of light, lest they should look after more.
You forbid your Captiues to reade our Relations;
and in your owne, you slubber-ouer whatsoeuer
toucheth you neer. You well knew, M.
Fisher, that Antiquity neuer knew your drossie
treasure of superaboundant satisfactions, nor your
dry suppers without the Lords Cup, nor your solitary
Communions without Communicants, nor
your vnintelligible praiers, nor your ignorant de

And therefore you doo well and wisely heer not
to lay these blocks for your blinde children to
stumble at, which neither you, nor all the Iesuits
in Christendome are able to remoue.

                     There are two Quaeres in

Protestants in all Ages can be shewed, &amp;c.
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  There are not two Quaeres or

and must adde somewhat to That
that goes before. It is all one, as if you
should expound the words of the Apostle,
Prouide honest things before God and
men; before God, that is, before men.
               
            
            
               
               Master FISHER'S Answer.
               My Question is meant to be but one entire Question.
And so, to cut off all needlesse wrangling (made by D.
White and D. Featly about the Aduerb Vtrùm, whether,
and the Copulatiue et, and; as if Grammar-scholars
had been disputing, rather than graue Diuines,
who were not to stand on rigour of Grammar, especially
in this case, where the sense of the speaker is plaine, and
may well stand with Grammar) Master Fisher said,
The question being mine, it pertaineth to mee to tell the
meaning: and my meaning was onely to make is one
question, viz.
               
               Whether the Protestant, Church were so visible, as
the Names of visible Protestants in all Ages
may bee shewed out of good Authors?
               Wherefore if you will dispute, you must dispute in
my sense, and must conclude the affirmatiue, viz.
The Protestant Church was so visible, as the Names
of the professors in all Ages may bee shewed out of good
Authors.
            
            
               Doctor FEATLY'S Reply.
               First, the parts of your question are distinguished
really: for a Protestant Church may haue
beene visible in many Ages, and yet not the
names of visible Protestants liuing in those Ages
now to bee produced, as your selfe confesseth
in effect, page 33. line 23. Wee doe not require, that all

visible mens names should bee vpon record, nor all records
produced.
               
               Secondly, they are distinguished formally in
words, whether the protestant Church, &amp;c. And
whether the Names, &amp;c.
               Thirdly, they are distinguished by points:
for in the middle of your question, before the second
part of it, you your selfe put a colon thus(:).
               Fourthly, you distinguish them your selfe in
your answer, in the written copie which I haue:
for to the first part you answer in the margent,
It was not: which answer was not, nor can bee
applied to the latter part.
               Either the parts of your question are distinct
in sense, or out of question you propound them
senslesly, whether and whether, two whethers,
meaning but one. Admit the construction you
giue of the first part, viz. Whether a Protestant
Church were visible in all Ages, that is, so visible,
as the Names of visible Protestants may bee shewed:
what construction then will you make of the
latter clause, &amp; whether the Names may be shewed?
               
               Is not this iust like Battus his spell in the Latin
Poet;

                     —Subillis
                     Montibus, inquit, erant, et erant sub montibus illis:
                  
               
               Or the like of the French:

                     Car com
                           •
                        ' vn' Aigle mountant an clair soleil.
                     Car c'estoite vn' Aigle mountant an clair soleil.
                  
               
               It is as if I should propound such a question:
Whether Iesuites be so honest men, that they

will not equiuocate, and whether they will
not equiuocate?
               Or whether the letters in a small print are so
visible that they may bee read, and whether
they may bee read?
               Or whether the parts of this question are so
distinguished that they are not altogether
confounded, and whether they are not altogether
confounded?
               But you say, I am bound to dispute in your
sense. What sense mean you? The sense that is to
be made of your words, or the sense which you
make by your mental reseruation? It seemeth you
are so vsed to your Iesuitical Cabala, that you cannot
in your disputing but smacke of it. I am
bound to dispute with you, you say, in your sense.
I grant you: am I therfore to dispute with you in
your non-sence? But you say, that it is for Grammar
Scholars to argue about the Aduerb Vtrum,
and the copulatiue et and. Tell your great Clark,
Cardinall Bellarmine, so, who wier-drawes your
Sacrifice of the Masse out of the Copulatiue (et)
and: And he was a Priest of the most high God, &amp;c.
and your Transubstantiation, out of the Pronoune,
hoc: Hoc est Corpus, &amp;c. &amp; your Popes supremacie,
out of the Pronoune, tibi: Dico tibi Petre,
&amp;c. Doth not Saint Austen presse Grammaticall
Arguments against Cresconius the Grammarian?
Nay, doth not Saint Paul himselfe presse a Grammaticall

                  It seemes you are nominals,
rather then reals, you stand so much vpon
naming: will you vndertake to name visible

professors of our Religions in all Ages, for
ought I know, the best way for vs is, to be all
naturall men.

while.
               
            
            
               Master FISHER'S Answer.
               To this obiection (touching the Acephali) M.
Boulton answered, that those Acephali held some
particular Doctrine, which did amount to the nature
of a name, sufficient to distinguish them from others, insinuating
heereby, that these Acephali were not Anonymi.
               
               Further it may be answered, that it is not certaine,
whether they had any particular Author: for some say,
that they were a company, who in the controuersie betwixt
Iohn the Bishop of Antioch, &amp; Cyril of Alexandria,
behaued themselues like Neutrals, submitting
themselues to neither as to their Head. Others think,
that they were certaine men, who, beeing the Fauourers
of Petrus Mogus
                  Moggus. the Heretick, did afterwards renounce
him from beeing their Head, because he would
not accurse the Councell of Chalcedon. Others say,

that one Seueius, Bishop of Antioch, was their Author.
               But howsoeuer this particular were, it doth not conclude,
that there could be in all Ages visible professors
of the Protestants faith; whereof no story, nor other antient
Monument maketh mention of names, or opinions,
or places of aboad of any of them, or of those who opposed
them, as Stories make mention of some of these circumstances
both of the Acephali, and whatsoeuer other
eminent professors of euery true or false Religion. Wee
doe not require, that all visible mens names should bee
vpon Record, nor all Records produced. For, although
to prooue such a visible Church as that of our Sauiour
Christ, described in Scripture, to bee spred ouer the
world, a small number of visible Professors bee not sufficient,
Lib. de vnitate Ecclesiae.as Saint Austen prooueth against the Donatists;
yet to shew how confident wee are of our cause, wee for
the present onely require, that Three eminent Protestants
names in all Ages, be produced out of good Authors.
But they are so farre from beeing able to produce
three, as they cannot name one in euery Age (as is
cleerely proued in the Protestants Apology) neither
indeed can they abide with any patience, when they bee
much pressed in this point, as appeareth by diuers who
haue beene vrged, and in particular by D. Featly in this
Conference; who hauing beene called vpon seuerall
times to produce Names, as hee had vndertaken at one
time, he burst foorth into these words, set down by the
Protestant Relator: What? will nothing content
you but a buttery-book? you shall haue a buttery-book,
if you will stay a while. Note (Reader) this

Doctors want of grauity and patience, and what a fit title
he giues to a Catalogue of names of Protestants, who
indeed are more like to be
                     •
                   found in a Buttery-book,
then in any good Record of antiquity, as hauing had their
beginning of late in one Martin Luther, who, after his
Apostasie, more respected the Buttery, then any Ecclesiasticall
Story.
            
            
               Doctor FEATLY'S Reply.
               In the Answer to this Paragraph, first, you
shake hands with the Acephali: afterwards, you
salute the Donatists: in the end, you take vp your
lodging with the Spright of the buttery; in
whose company, it seemes, you take most delight.
About the yeere 480.To beginne with your Acephali. These
Acephali were a shole of Hereticks, bred (as it
should seeme) of the spawne of Eutyches &amp; Dioscorus:
for they held, that there was but one nature
in Christ, viz. the diuine, which they affirmed to haue
beene crucified. These differed from other Hereticks,
in this especially; That whereas other
Hereticks for the most part took their names
from the Author and Head of their Sect, (as the
Arians from Arius, the Nestorians from Nestorius,
&amp;c); these Hereticks, because their first Author
could not bee certainly knowne, were termed
Acephali from 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      priuatiuo, and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , signifying a
Head; as if you would say, Head-lesse Hereticks.
So that, as Pliny writes of the herb Anonymos, nomen
non inueniendo inuenit, that it took it's name

                  Anonymos, from the want of a name; so it may be
truly said of these Hereticks, that they took their
name from the want, or at least, ignorance of the
name of their parent and first Author. Thus your
Alfonso deduceth, and expoundeth their name:
Haeretici Acephali dicti,
                        Alfonsus a Castro aduersus Haereses. l. 4. sic nominati sunt, 
                        〈◊〉
                     
simul insurgentes, nullus repertus est, quiillarum esse
                        •
                     
princeps atque magister. The Hereticks tearmed
Acephali, were so named, because multitudes of
them rising together, there was found none, who
might be their Head and Master. Neither doe
you in your Answer contradict, but rather confirme
this Etymology, by rehearsing diuers and
sundry opinions touching their Head and Author.
Which variety of opinions, and difference
of Authors about him, plainely argueth, that no
certainty was, or can be had of him, who he was,
and much lesse what was his proper name.
Wherefore, distrusting your former Answer, you
adde a second, saying, Howsoeuer this particular
were, it doth not conclude, that there could be in all Ages
visible professors of the Protestant faith, whereof no Story
nor other antient Monument maketh 
                        〈◊〉
                      of
names, or opinions, or places of aboad of any of them, 
                        〈◊〉
                     
of those who opposed them. I grant, it doth not conclude
so much, neither was it brought to conclude
so much: it prooueth sufficiently what
intended, viz. That your Question is grounded
vpon a false Supposal: it cutteth M. Sweet's reason
in the hams, If there were visible Protestants in 
                        〈◊〉
                     
Ages; then certainly they may bee now named. The

Head and Author of the Heresie of the Acephali
was, I suppose, a visible man: yet can he not now,
nor, for ought appeares, could he then, when hee
broched his Heresie, be named. In like manner,
the 7000. that neuer bowed their knees to Baal,
and all your Ancestors descending from Noah,
were certainly visible men: yet can they not
now be all named; and therefore M. Sweet's Argument,
ab authoritate negatiue, and à negatione
vocis ad negationem rei, is a poore fallacie, fit to bee
ranked with that which they wrongfully fasten
on my Argument à priori, viz. petitio principij,
or the begging the Question.
               I wil not say, that in disputing about the Acephali,
you shew your selfe 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : but certainly in that
which followeth, you shew your self 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,
else you would not so ignorantly apply Saint Austens
proofes in his Book against Donatists, to disprooue
our Church. For it is well knowne, that
we teach with Saint Austen, that Christs visible
Catholique Church is dispersed farre and wide
ouer the face of the whole earth. But you are
the Donatists of our Age: for, as the Donatists
confined the Catholique Church of Christ, to
Africa, and therein, to the Sect of Donatus: so
you also restraine the Church of Christ to Rome,
and the Popes adherents.
                     Aug. Epist. 80. ad Hesychium. We teach with Saint
Austen, Non Romanos, sed omnes gentes Dominus semini
Abrahae media quoque iuratione promisit: That
God promised with an oath to Abraham, not
the Romans, but all Nations for his seed. We

beleeue, that wheresoeuer the Scriptures are receiued,
and Christs Sacraments administred,
God calles some by ordinary meanes; and consequently
there is a Christian Church (though neuer
hearing of Rome, or Papall Iurisdiction) who are
ordained to saluation. Wee account all that professe
the name of Christ, &amp; Doctrine of the Gospell, to
be members of the visible Catholick Church; yet
with this difference, some are sound members and
parts, others vnsound, and these more or lesse.
Wee doubt not, but Christ hath his flock vnder
the Turk and Tartarian, and Mogol, in Asia, Africa,
Europe, yea Italy, and Rome it selfe, euen in the
denne of Antichrist. And therefore we are the
true Catholicks, who maintaine verè Catholicam
Ecclesiam, a Church truly Catholicke: and you
are the Donatists and Masters of the separation
of these times, who damne all sorts of Christians,
saue those who are content to receiue the mark
of the Romish Beast in their fore-heads. What
then speake you of three Protestants to be named
in euery Age? Although our Sauiours
words are most true,Mat. 18. 
                  Where there are two or three
gathered in my name, there am I. And although
Tertullians inferences from those words,Exhort. ad virg. are most
true, Vbi tres sunt, Ecclesia est, licèt Laici sint: Where
there are three,de poe
                        •
                     it. there is the Church, yea though
those three bee Lay-men: and, In 
                        〈…〉
                      Ecclesia
est, the Church is in one or two men: yea
Alensis, and diuers among you, remembred by
Tostatus,
                  Prolog. in Euangel. affirme, that from the time of Christs

suffering, vntil his resurrection, sides in sol
                        •
                      remansit
beata Virgine, that onely the blessed Virgin
perseuered in the faith; and consequently, that
the Church subsisted for that time onely in her.
Yet God be blessed for it, wee need not to fly to
any such defence. We shall bring into the field,
pares aquilas, nay, plures aquilas, more ensignes and
banners then you, yea incomparably more, for
the first and best Ages: and if you exceed vs
in the latter, I wish you to remember, that in
time, in liquors, the lees and mother gathers
towards the bottome: and a spoonefull of pure
wine is better then a Hogs-head of dregs.
               
                  Yea, but we are so farre from beeing able to produce
three Protestants in all Ages, as we cannot name one in
euery age. How proue you this? Forsooth M. Brierly
hath prooued it to your hand. A beggerly Rapsodist,
whose patched cloak is already all to-be-tome
by one of our noble Mastiues, and the ragges
that remaine, as I am informed, will be shortly by
another puld away. Were M. Brierly a man of
better iudgement, and more integrity then our
worthy Morton, now Lord Bishop of Couentry and
Litchfield, hath prooued him to be: yet beeing
a knowne Papist, to alleage meerely his work and
words, to mee is but a dry kinde of proofe; and
therefore you did well in this place, to knock at
the Buttery-dore.
               And heere I intreat the Reader to note, how
the very name of the Buttery reuiues the Iesuite.
In all the other passages of his Book, there is nothing

that pretends to wit or mirth: but heer he
is very pleasant, now his dull wit is whetted: he
was not able in all the Conference, nor since
in his Answer, to send out such a flash. Will you
know the reason? The Spright of the Butterie possesseth
him, and thus he diuines; The Protestants
cannot abide with any patience, when they bee much
pressed in this poynt, as appeareth by diuers that haue
been vrged, and in particular by Doctor Featly in this
Conference, who hauing been called vpon to produce
Names, burst forth, &amp;c.
               
               It is true, I burst forth, not into a passion, as you
would make the Reader beleeue, but into a
laughter, as did the rest of the company: neither
did I by any gesture or speech, discouer my impatience,
but your folly, who, when I alledged
you reasons and testimonies, were not content
with them, but called for emptie names, &amp;c.
And what was this, but to call for a Colledge
Buttery-book; which is nothing but a Register of
the names of such as are in that societie? If the
sprite of the Butterie had not obfuscated your
braine, &amp; surprized your iudgement, you might
haue vnderstood, &amp; plainly perceiued, that I cō
                  pared
not a Catalogue of noble Confessors and
Martyrs of the Catholique Protestant faith, to a
Buttery-book; but such a Catalogue as you then
required, and you vsually bring, to proue the visiblity
of your church, viz. a companie of names,
and nothing else; testes sine testimonijs, witnesses
deposing nothing for you. And, may not such

emptie Catalogues be fitly compared to Butterie-books?
Note, Reader, say you, what a fit Title
hee giueth to a Catalogue of Names of Protestants;
who, indeed, are more like to bee found in a Butterie-booke,
then any good Record of Antiquitie, as hauing
had their beginning of late in one Martin Luther;
who, after his apostasie, more respected the Butterie,
then any ecclesiasticall storie.
               
               I maruell not, that you, Yeomen of the Popes
Butterie and Pantry, and the Blacke-gard of
Rome, haue a sharpe tooth against Luther; who,
by burning the Popes haruest of Indulgences, hath
made the Catalogue farre lesse of those that
brued for the Friers Buttery, and baked for the
Popes Kitchin. Certainly, if Martin Luther had
so fat a belly as you paint him with, hee did but
hold that which hee got among you: for, after
hee for sooke Sodom (which you Apostataes call
apostasie) hee so hated and detested the gluttony
and drunkennesse of Monks and Friers, and
so sharpely inueighed against them, that Erasmus
sometimes spake as truly as wittily of him; That
though hee otherwise highly esteemed of him, yet hee
could not but confesse, that hee was much too blame in
two things; that hee presumed to touch theBoth being No
                           •
                        me ta
                           •
                        
                        gere. Popes
Crowne, and the Monkes bellie. Wherefore seeing
Luther deserueth no better of your fraternities,
strike him out of your Butterie-booke, and put
Father Parsons in his place, the grand Master of
your new equiuocating Religion, or religious
equiuocation, because, good man, his name was

strucke out of the Buttery-booke of Bailliol-Colledge
in Oxford; and hee expeld, for falsifying
the Butterie-booke, and thereby cozening, and
purloining the Students of that Colledge.
            
            
               The Protestant Relation.
               Paragraph the seauenth, touching
the comparison betweene a proofe
à priori, and à posteriori.
               
                  Doctor Featly.
                  
                  That Church, whose
faith is eternall, is so visible, that the
Names of some professors thereof may
bee shewed in all Ages.
                  But the faith of the Protestant Church
is eternall and perpetuall:
Ergo.
                  
               
               
                  Master Fisher.
                  
                  Faith eternall? Who
euer heard of faith eternall? Saint Paul saith,
that faith ceaseth.
               
               
                  Doctor Featly.
                  
                  You haue a purpose,
Master Fisher, to cauill: you know my
meaning well enough by the terme perpetuall,
to wit, that Christian faith which
hath continued from Christs first publishing
it, till this present, and shall continue

till his second Comming. The
Church which houldeth this faith, you beleeue,
shal be so visible, that the Names of
the professors thereof may bee shewed in
all Ages.
                  But the Protestant Church holdeth this
perpetuall faith:
Ergo.
                  
               
               
                  
                     Master Fisher.
                  Your Argument is a fallacie,
called, Petitio principii.
                  
               
               
                  Doctor Featly.
                  
                  A demonstration à



causa, or à priori, is not Petitio principij.
                  
                  But such is my Argument:
Ergo.
                  
                  Is it not a sounder Argument, to proue
the visibility of the professors from the
truth of their faith, then (as you do) the
truth of your faith from the visibilitie of
professors? Visible professors argue not
a right faith. Heretikes, Mahumetanes,
and Gentiles, haue visible professors of
their impieties: yet will it not hence follow,
that they haue a right beliefe. On the
contrary, we knowe by the promises of
God in the Scripture, that the Church
which maintaineth the true faith, shall

haue alwaies professors, more or lesse
visible.
               
               
                  
                     Master Sweet.
                  You ought to proue the
truth of your Church à posteriori, for that is
to the question, and not à priori.
                  
               
               
                  Doctor Featly.
                  
                  Shall you prescribe me
my weapons? Is not an Argument à priori,
better then an Argument à posteriori?
This is, as if in battell you should enioyne
your enemie to stab you with a knife, and
not with a sword or dagger. I will vse
what weapous I list: take you what
buckler you can.
               
               
                  
                     Master Fisher.
                  A proofe à posteriori is
more demonstratiue, than à priori.
                  
                  Heere Master Fisher sheweth his Academicall
learning, in preferring a demonstration
à posteriori,
                     A Protestant standing by. before that which
proceedeth à priori. Is not a demonstration
of the effect from the cause, better
then of the cause by the effect?
               
               In this place, or vpon the like occasion
againe offered, neerer the end of the disputation,
Master Sweet replied.
               
                  
                     M. Sweet.
                  This is to diuert the question.
The question is not now, Whether our faith or

yours bee the Catholicke primitiue faith, but
the question now is of the effect, to wit, the visibilitie
of your Church, which you ought to
proue out of good Authors.
               
               
                  Doctor Featly.
                  
                  May not a man proue
the effect by the cause? Is there no other
meanes to proue the effect, but by naming
men, and producing authors for it?
               
               
                  
                     Master Sweet.
                  An effect is posterius; the
question is about an effect: therefore you ought
to proue it à posteriori.
                  
               
               
                  Doctor Featly.
                  
                  What a reason is this?
May not an effect bee prooued by his
cause? Must an effect bee needs proued
by an effect? or à posteriori, because an
effect is posterius?
                  
               
            
            
               Master FISHER'S Answer.
               Thus farre the Relator, who hath heere added much
more then was said: and in particular, those formall
words which he reporteth Master Fisher to haue said,
viz. A proofe à posteriori is more demonstratiue, then
à priori, Master Fisher did not speake: perhaps hee
might say, That a proofe à posteriori doth better demonstrate
to vs, then à priori; not meaning in generall
to preferre a Logicall demonstration à posteriori, before
that which is à priori; but that such a proofe à




posteriori, as hee in this present question required, and
as the question it selfe exacted, would better demonstrate
or shew to all sorts of men, which is the true
Church, then any proofe which Doctor Featly or D.
White can make à priori, to proue the Protestant
Church to bee the true Church, as shall be shewed when
need is, heereafter. At this present, it may suffie
                     •••
                  
say, to that which Doctor Featly now obiecteth against
the proofe taken from visibility, that Although all kind
of visible professors doe not argue right faith, yet want
of visibile professors argueth want of Christs true
Church. For, supposing it to bee true which euen D.
Featly himselfe heere saith (according to the Protestants
Relator) viz. wee knowe by the promises of God
in the Scripture, that the Church which maintaineth
the true faith, shall haue alwaies professors more or lesse
visible, and (as Master Fisher further proued in one
of the foresaid papers, giuen to the old gentleman before
this meeting) so visible, as their Names in all Ages
may bee shewed out of good Authors; supposing also out
of Doctor Whitaker, contr. Dur. l. 7. p. 472. that
Whatsoeuer is foretold by the antient Prophets, of the
propagation, amplitude, and glorie of the Church; is
most cleerly witnessed by Histories; and supposing
lastly, out of Doctor Iohn White, in his way, p. 338.
That things past cannot bee shewed to vs, but by Histories.
Supposing all this (I say), it is most apparant,
that if there cannot bee produced (as there cannot)
Names of Protestants, or of any other professors of Christian
faith in all Ages, out of Histories, to whom Gods
promises agree, besides those which are knowne Roman

Catholiques: not Protestants, nor any other but onely the
Roman Catholiques are the true church of Christ which
teacheth the true faith; and of which, al sorts are to learn
infallible faith necessary to saluation.
            
            
               Doctor FEATLY'S Reply.
               I maruel not, M. Fisher, that you leaue M. Sweet

your strength and skil, to get yourself out of the
mire. M. Sweet, since he left our Vniuersities, and
was metriculated into your Society, seemes (to
speak in our Academicall Phrase) to haue resumed
gradum Simeonis, and to haue proceeded
backward: for, whatsoeuer truth, in Logick or
Philosophy, hee had learned in our Schools, he
hath learned to vnlearn in yours. It seemeth, he
hath met with some such Master as Timotheus the
Musician was; who took double pay of his scholars,
for vnteaching them what they had learnd of
others. Hee was taught in our Schools, that an
effect cannot be scientifically proued or demonstrated,

Thirdly, the Romane or Westerne Church
ought to bee distinguished from the Papacie, or
mystery of iniquity in it; which is not the
Church, but a preualent and predominant faction
in it. The Romane Church we acknowledge
to bee a member (though a sick and weak one)
of the Catholique visible Church; and consequently,
to haue some part in the gracious promises
made to the Church, in the Gospell: but
the Papacy, or that predominant faction, is no
member, but a botch or an aposteme in the
Church; to which none of those promises belong,
yet many prophesies are cleerly fulfilled in
it.
               First, 1. Tim. 1. 4. Now, the Spirit speaketh expresly,
that In the later times some shall depart from
the faith, giuing heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines
of diuels, forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain
from meats, which God hath appointed to be receiued
with thanksgiuing. This Prophesie hath been
fulfild in the Papacy euer since Pope Hildebrand's
time;Auent. annal. Boior. l. 5. edit Basil. ad Pern. p 448.
                   in which, as Auentin
                        ••
                     
                   reports, the people
in some places trod vnder foot the Hoasts
that were consecrated by married Priests: Tales
enim non esse sacerdotes, neque sacrificare, Hildebrandus
docebat: for, Hildebrand taught, that such were
no Priests. And again, Maritos ab vxoribus separat,
scorta, pudicis coniugibus: stuprà, incestus, adulteri
                        •
                     ,
casto praefert matrimonio: Hee seuered men from
their wiues: he preferred harlots before married
wiues; fornication, adultery, and incest, before

chaste marriage. And likewise in the Papacy
that part of the Prophesie is fulfilled, touching
the forbidding of certain meats; as for example,
flesh, and egges, and white meats, and the like,
and that for conscience sake, and vnder paine of
deadly sin, and accounting such abstinence meritorious.
               Secondly, that Prophesie in 2. Thes. 2. 9. Comming,
after the power of Satan, in all power of signes
and lying wonders, is daily fulfilled in the Papacy,
and no where else. See their Legends, old and
new.
               Thirdly, that Prophesie, 2. Pet. 2. 18. They allure
by the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonnesse, &amp;c.
is fulfilled in the Papacy, which permitteth publick
Stews, I might say, alloweth, because who
keep those houses, do therefore pay a pension to
the Pope.
               Fourthly, that Prophesie, Iude 16. speaking great
swelling words of vanity, is fulfilled in the Papacy;
which teacheth, that the Church of Rome is the
Mother and Queen of all Churches; that the
Pope cannot erre; that hee is aboue the Law of
God; that those who adhere to him, can more
than merit heauen: they can supererrogate.
               Fiftly, that Prophesie, 2 Pet. 2. 3. and Apoc. 18.
3. The Merchants of the earth are waxed rich,
through the abundance of her delicacies. Through
couetousnesse, shall they with feigned words make
Merchandize of you, and the like in the Apoc. is fulfilled
in the Papacie, which draweth an infinite

treasure, by the Merchandize of pardons and
indulgences for releasing soules out of Purgatory.
               Sixtly, that Prophesie, 2. Thes. 2. 4. Hee as God
sitteth in the Temple of God, shewing himselfe that hee
is God, is verified in the Papacie, which giueth
the Pope the stile of Lord God, Head of the Church,
Lyon of the Tribe of Iuda, &amp;c. and power to dispence
with breach of oathes, and incestuous marriages,
&amp;c.
               Seuenthly, that Prophesie, 2. Thes. 2. 7. The mystery
of iniquity doth already worke: onely hee who 
                        〈◊〉
                     
letteth, will let, vntill he be taken out of the way, and 
                        〈◊〉
                     
shall that wicked man be reuealed. This I say, according
to the interpretation of the Fathers, Ter

                     l
and Chrysostome,
                  De Resurrectione. is fulfilled in the Papacie.
Tertullian saith Romani imperij absessi

                     , in decem

Chrysostome giueth some more light, saying,
When the Romane Empire shall be taken away,
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     .
then hee shall come. Now all the world seeth,
that the Papacie is built vpon the ruines of the
Romane Empire, and at this day possesseth the
seat thereof.
               Eightthly, that Prophesie, Reuel. 9. 3. &amp; 7▪
                  There came out of the smoke Locusts vpon the
earth, &amp;c. and on their heads, were (as it were)
Crownes, &amp;c. agreeth to your swarmes of
Monks and Friers: and one of your own Expositors

interpreteth their Crownes, the round circle
vpon your shauelings head, like vnto a
Crowne.
               Ninthly, That Prophesie, Reuel. 13. 11. And
I beheld another Beast comming vp out of the earth, and
he had two hornes like a Lamb, and he spake as a Dragon,
and hee exerciseth all the power of the first Beast,
&amp;c. agreeth to the Papacie and Pope, who resembleth
Christ, whose Vicar hee calleth himselfe,
and yet carrieth himselfe like a Dragon in
the Church, and he exerciseth also the power of
the first Beast, to weet, the Romane Empire, described
in the first verse, by seuen heads and ten
hornes, because, as the first Beast, the Romane
Empire, by power and temporal authority, so the
Pope, by policie and spirituall iurisdiction, ruleth
ouer a great part of the world.
               Tenthly, that Prophesie, Reuel. 13. 18. Let
him that hath vnderstanding, count the number
of the Beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number
is 666. agreeth to the Pope, as I shewed before
out of Irenaeus.

be the name of the Beast: the last Kingdome
hath this name, for they are Latines who now
rule. Arethas agreeth with Irenaeus in iudgement,
as Feuer dentius himselfe noteth.
               
                  Eleuenthly, that Prophesie, Reuel. 17. 3. I saw

a woman sit vpon a scarlet-coloured Beast, full of names
of blasphemie, hauing seuen heads and ten horns, and
verse 9, The seuen heads are seuen hils, on which the
woman sitteth. and verse 18, The woman is the City
which reig
                     •
                  eth ouer the Kings of the earth, agreeth
with the Papacy, as Saint Ierom teacheth vs.
               
               
                  Twelfthly,Epist. 17. ad Eustochium, c. 7. et l. 2. aduer. Iouinianum.
                      that Prophesie, Reuel. 17. 4. The
woman was araied in purple and scarlet color, and decked
with gold, and precious stones, and pearles, hauing
a golden cup in her hand, full of abominations and silthinesse
of her fornication: &amp; supra, verse 2. With
whom the Kings of the earth haue committed fornication,
and the inhabiters of the earth haue been made drunk
with the wine of her fornication, agreeth to the Papacy,
which is set forth in most pompous manner,
and enticeth the Kings and people of the
earth to idolatry, which is spirituall fornication.
               
               Thirteenthly, that Prophesie, Reuel. 17. 6. And
I saw the woman drunken with the bloud of the Saints;
and with the bloud of the Martyrs of Iesus, agreeth
to the Papacy or Romish Synagogue, which
hath spilt the bloud of many thousand protestant
Martyrs, since the 1000 yeer; in wth, Satan was
let loose, vnder the name of Waldensian and Albigēsian
hereticks, &amp; the like names of reproach.
               Fourteenthly, that Prophesie, Reuel. 17. 16. 17.
And the tenne horns shall hate the Whore, &amp;c. for,
God put in their hearts, to giue their Kingdome to the
Beast, till the Word of God be fulfilled, agreeth to the
Pope and Papacy; to which, the greater part of
the Kings of the earth, after a sort, gaue their

Kingdomes, by submitting themselues, and subiecting
their Kingdomes to the Antichristian
Yoke. But now (God bee blessed) diuers Kings
and States, whose eies God hath anointed with the eyesalue
of the Spirit, haue discouered the abomination
and filthinesse of the Whore of Babylon, and
begin to hate her, and make her desolate: and
wee doubt not, but in time other Princes and
States will ioyne with them, and perfectly accomplish
this Prophesie, by stripping her naked,
and eating her flesh, and burning her with fire.
               Now to sharpen my weapons a little vpon M.
Fisher's Whetstone, Confingant tale quid Haeretici:
confingant tale quid Papistae: Let the Papists feine
some such like thing: let them deuise, if they can,
any Protestant Church, or any other society or
person in the world, in which the marks of Antichrist
aboue-described, are so conspicuously to
bee seen, as in the Romish Synagogue, and the
Head thereof, and then I will confesse, I haue
spilt all my paines in deciphering these characters:
but, till they haue brought some man,
State, Society or Church in the world, in whom
the former marks are more visible, than they are
at this day in the Romish Church and her Head,
I shall bee euer of the opinion of that learned
Iudge and States-man, who said pleasantly, that,
If the Pope of Rome were not Antichrist, he had
very ill luck: for, if there should be a proclamation
or warrant, to send for a man described by
such marks as Antichrist is in the Apocalypse,

without all question, the Pursuiuant would attache
and bring the Pope of Rome.
               
            
            
               The Protestant Relation.
               Paragraph the eightth, touching
the demonstration of the Visibility
of the Church, by the eternity and immutability
of faith.
               
                  Doctor Featly.
                  
                  
                     That Church, whose
faith is eternall, perpetuall, and vnchanged,
is so visible as the catholick Church
ought to be, and the Popish Church by
M. Fisher is pretended to be.
                  
                  
                     But the faith of the Protestant Church
is eternall, perpetuall, and vnchanged:
                  
                  
                     
                        Ergo the Protestant Church is so visible,
as the Catholick Church ought to
be, and the Popish Church is pretended
by M. Fisher to be.
                  
               
               
                  M. Fisher.
                  
                  I distinguish the Maior. That
Church, whose faith is perpetuall and vnchanged,
so as the names can be shewed, is so visible
as the Catholique Church ought to be, and
as M. Fisher pretends the Roman Church to
be, I grant it.
                  
                     
That Church, whose faith is perpetuall, and
vnchanged, yet so, as the names cannot bee
shewed in all Ages, is so visible as the Catholique
Church ought to be, and as M. Fisher
pretends the Romane Church ought to bee, I
deny it. To the Minor I apply the like distinction,
and consequently to the conclusion in the
same manner.
               
               
                  Doctor Featly.
                  
                  What? Answer you to
the conclusion also? This is a straine of
new Logicke.
               
            
            
               Master FISHER'S Answer.
               This Argument, as it is set downe, is so far from
being a demonstration (whose propertie is, To conuince
the vnderstanding) as it is not a probable or morall
perswasion: for, I am verily perswaded, that no wise
man (not alreadie possessed with Protestant opinions)
will or can bee so much as morally conuinced, or in any
sort probably perswaded by it, that Protestants bee the
true visible Church, more then a man (in case of doubt)
can be by the like Argument, which a man may make, to
proue himselfe and his brethren to bee as well spoken of,
as any in all the parish, thus:
               
                  Those who are in heart true honest men, are as well
spoken of, as any in all the parish.
               
               
                  But I and my brethren are in heart true honest
men:
                  Ergo.
               
               
                  
As this proofe is not able to make any man, not partially
affected, to beleeue these men to be well spoken of,
or to bee honest-men: so neither can Doctor Featlies
proofe make any wise man beleeue Protestants to bee the
true visible Church, or to haue the true faith.
               Secondly, if the terme, That Church, bee vnderstood
onely of a particular Church (as for example, the
Church of England) it is so farre from a Logicall demonstration,
as it hath not in it any Logicall Forme, according
to any of the vsual moods, Barbara Caelarent,
&amp;c. But if it bee vnderstood vniuersally of
euerie Church that is or may bee, then both Maior
and Minor are false: and so it cannot bee a demonstration,
whose propertie is, To consist of most certainly
true propositions. The Maior in this latter sense is
false, for that there may be a Church or companie, who
may haue inward faith, eternall, and vnchanged (as
for example, a Church of Angels) who, for want of
visible profession, are not so visible as the Catholique
Church ought to be. The Minor is false also: for, the Protestant
Church hath not the true primitiue faith, neither
is that faith they haue, vnchanged; but so often changed,
and so much subiect to change, as one may say (as a
great person in Germany once said of some Protestants)
What they hould this yeere, I doe in
some sort know: but what they will hould next
yeere, I doe not knowe. Which is true, in regard
they haue no certaine and infallible rule, sufficient to
preserue them from change. But if Doctor Featly
shall say, that hee neither meant the tearme, That
Church, in either of the aforesaid senses, but meant to

signifie by it, That one, holy, Catholique, and Apostolique
Church, which the holy Scriptures doe shew both to haue
perpetuall vnchanged faith, and also to bee perpetually
visible, then indeed the Maior is true; but the Minor
is most false: and so the argument is farre from being
a demonstration; especially, when it endeuoureth to
proue magis notum per ignotius, viz. the visibilitie
(which is easily knowne) by the truth of Doctrine
(which is more hard to be knowne) especially by onely
Scripture. Of the sense whereof (according to Protestants,
who say, The whole Church may erre) no
particular man can bee infallibly sure: for if the whole
Church or companie (to whom Christ promised the
Spirit of truth to teach them all truth, may erre, then
much more may euerie particular man erre: and consequently,
no particular man can bee infallibly sure of the
sense of Scripture.
               Thirdly, this Argument beggeth or supposeth that
which is in question; for in asking which is the true visible
Church, or congregation of the true faithfull, wee
aske, at least vertually, which is the true faith: in
regard the true Church cannot be without this true faith:
yea therefore doe wee ask which is the true Church, that
of it, being first knowne by other marks, wee may learne
what is the true faith in all points, in which wee yet
knowe not what is to bee held for true diuine faith.
               Fourthly, although faith be prerequired to be in some
or other members of the true Church, yet inward faith
alone, without some outward profession, by which it is
made visible or sensible, doth not sufficiently make a
man to bee a member of the visible Church.
               
                  
Let D. Featly looke back vpon his Argument, and
tell vs what Academicall learning taught him to call it,
A demonstration à priori.
               
            
            
               Doctor FEATLY's Reply.
               I know, diuers learned men haue beene of the
opinion, that Aristotles Demonstrator doth
dwell vnder the same roofe, with Tullies Orator,
and Xenophons Prince, &amp; Castilians Courtier, namely,
Sir Thomas Moores Vtopia, extra anni solisque
vias. To vndertake to make a demonstration,
consisting ex veris, primis, immediatis, prioribus, notioribus
causis conclusionis, is all one, saith Ludouicus
Viues, as if to cure a most dangerous disease, a
Quacksaluer should promise a strange receipt
made of foure simples; the first whereof is
found in India; the second, amongst the Ceres; the
third, in the Riphean Hilles; and the fourth, in the
nest of a Phenix. If that demonstration which
they call potissima, the soueraigne demonstration,
and non par
                        •
                     iell, containing the quintessence of al necessarie
proofe (consisting of all tearmes reciprocall,
and all propositions inabled, and qualified
with those three degrees of necessitie, so called,

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , &amp; 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , de omni, per se, et quatenus
ipsum) were any where in vse, it should seeme to
bee in the Mathematicks, the most certaine
Science, and fullest of euident demonstrations:
but Pererius the Iesuite, and others with him, vndertake
to prooue, that the Mathematicians vse

no such demonstrations: and therfore many Logicians
and Philosophers conclude, that such absolute
demonstrations, exalted to the highest degree
of necessity, presently conuincing and captiuating
the vnderstanding, are meere imaginary speculations.
Let the Philosophers and Logicians, among
themselues, end this controuersie. I will pronounce
sentence peremptorily on neither side.
But setting aside that Idea of demonstration, and
speaking of such demonstrations à priori, or à



causâ, as are vsually found in Scholastick Diuinity,
I will maintaine this Syllogisme to be a good
demonstration (as demonstrations go), current
against all M. Fisher's and M. Sweet's Logick.
               
                  The Church holding the perpetuall
faith, grounded on the eternall Gospell, hath
perpetuall visible Professors of that faith.
               
               
                  The true Church of Christ holdeth the perpetuall
faith, grounded on the eternall Gospell:
               
               
                  Therefore the true Church hath perpetuall
visible Professors of that faith, &amp;c.
               
               For the Maior or first proposition, it is partly
grounded vpon Christs promises rehearsed before,
in the setting downe of the state of the
Question, touching the Visibility of the
Church, assertion the fourth; and partly vpon
that Text of theRom. 10. 10. Apostle, With the hart man beleeueth
vnto righteousnesse: and with the tongue, confession
is made vnto saluation.
               
               The Minor or assumption is most necessarily

true, because this eternall faith is the formall
cause, constituting and making the true Church;
for,
                     Gasp. Lauren. De public, disputat. as Laurentius rightly argueth, Homines non constituunt
Ecclesiam, quat
                        •
                     nus simpliciter sunt homines
Europei, Romani &amp;c. sedquatenus sunt fideles: ergo fides
&amp; doctrina fidei, est causa formalis &amp; interna Ecclesiae,
et per eam Ecclesia constituitur, et per eandem dignoscitur:
Men make not the Church, simply as they
are Europeans, or Romanes, or Africans, or Britans,
or the like, but as they are of the faithfull,
or holding the faith: therefore, faith and the
Doctrine thereof, is the formall and internall
cause of the Church, and by it the Church is
made a Church, and distinguished from all other
societies. Heere then you haue the confession of
visible men to saluation, or the Visibility of professors
of the sauing faith: a proper attribute, or

                  , demonstrated of the proper subiect, the
true Church, by the proper and neerest cause,
the eternity of faith: and what more is to be required
in a true demonstration, à priori? You
will say, this demonstrateth, that the true Church
shall bee alwaies visible, but not that the Protestant
Church. I reply, either the Protestant
Church is to be supposed to be the true church,
or not: if it be supposed to bee the true Church,
then, hauing demonstrated the perpetuall Visibility
of the true Church, I haue consequently
demonstrated the perpetuall Visibility of the
Protestant Church; if this bee not to bee supposed
nor granted, then you should haue primarily

denied this, and put vs to the proofe of it; which
beeing prooued, would inferre the Visibility: but
this you did not, and (I think) durst not in the
Conference, for feare you should haue beene
presently conuinced; yet now, since the Conference,
you are growne so hardy as to deny it,
and therefore thus I proue it.
               
                  A Church, holding &amp; professing entirely the
perpetuall faith, needfull to saluation, is a true
Church.
               
               
                  The Protestant Church holdeth and professeth
entirely the perpetuall faith, &amp;c.
               
               
                  Therfore the Protestant Church is a true Chur.
               
               The Maior is confessed of all sides, and must
be so, because there is no saluation without the
Church: where therfore the sauing faith is held
and professed, there must needs bee the Church.
               The Minor or second proposition is thus confirmed:
               
                  The Primitiue Catholique faith,Iud. 3. Reu. 14. 6. once giuen
to the Saints, is the perpetuall faith grounded
on the euerlasting Gospel.
               
               
                  But the faith which the Protestant Church
holdeth, is the Primitiue Catholick faith, once
giuen to the Saints:
               
               
                  Therefore, the faith which the Protestant
Church holdeth, is the perpetuall faith, &amp;c.
               
               The Maior in this last Syllogisme is of vndoubted
truth.
               The Assumption is thus confirmed:
               
                  The faith deriued from the holy Scriptures,

contained in the three Creeds; The Apostles
Creed, the Nicen Creed, and the Creed of Athanasius
and the foure first generall Councels, is
the Primitiue and Catholique faith once giuen
to the Saints.
               
               
                  The Protestants faith is deriued from the
Scriptures, and contained in the three Creeds,
and foure Councels aboue-named:
               
               
                  Therefore the Protestant faith is the Primitiue
Catholique faith, once giuen to the Saints.
                  
               
               In this last Syllogisme, the Maior cannot be
denied by any who receyue these Creeds and
Councels.
               The Minor may bee confirmed three manner
of waies.
               First, by the publique profession, and practice
of the Church of England, and other Protestant
Churches.
               Secondly, by deduction of each particular
head of the Protestant faith, out of the principles
aboue-named.
               Thirdly, by the Confession of the Romish
Church it selfe.
               And first, it is well knowne to all who are
conuersant in the harmonie of Protestant
confessions, or haue obserued the practice of the
Protestant Churches, that the Protestant Doctrine
is, that No article of faith ought to bee beleeued,
vnder paine of eternall damnation, which is not either
expresly contained in Scriptures, or may be necessarily
and euidently deduced from them. All the Protestant

Churches reade or sing the Creeds aboue-named:
and for the foure first generall Councels,
there is no Protestant, who will not seale the true
faith deliuered in them with his blood, if hee be
cald thereunto.
               Secondly, there is no particular positiue Article
of the Protestant faith, which we will not
vndertake to proue by Scriptures. Let Master
Sweet or Master Fisher instance, where and when
they will; we will neuer refuse to meet them in
this field. On the contrarie, besides those fifteen
poynts set downe in the conference, there are many
other Tenets of the Roman Church, which no
Papist dare vndertake to proue by Scripture: &amp;
therefore, according to the maner of the ancient
Heretiques,
                     Irenaeus aduers. Haeres. l. 3 c. 2. 
                  Cùm ex Scripturis arguuntur, in accusationem
conuertuntur ipsarum Scripturarum, quasi
non rectè habeant, neque sint ex authoritate, &amp; quia
variè sunt dictae et quia nō possit ex his inueniri veritas
ab his qui nesciunt traditionē, nō enim per literas traditā illam,
sed per viuam vocē: When they are conuinced
by Scripture, they fall on accusing the Scriptures
thēselues, as if they were not as they ought
to be, or were not of authoritie, and that they are
variously or ambiguously vttered, and that out of
them the truth cānot be found, by those who are
ignorant of tradition; for that it (viz. the truth)
was not deliuered by letters, but by word of
mouth. Is not this in part your plea at this day,
that the scriptures are ful of ambiguities; that they receyue
countenance &amp; whole authority quoad nos,

from the Church; that the written Word, without vnwritten
traditions, is not sufficient.
               
               Thirdly, there is no positiue Article of our
faith, which you your selues, or the learnedst among
you doe not hold and beleeue as Catholique:
therefore wee are on a sure ground, euen
by your owne confession.
               To instance in most of the principall Articles.
               First, wee beleeue the Canonicall Scripture
to be the Word of God: you beleeue them also
to bee so, but adde vnto them the Apocrypha.
               
               Secondly, wee beleeue the Originals of the
two Testaments, in Hebrew and Greek, to bee
authenticall, and of vndoubted authoritie: you
(I hope) beleeue so too; but you adde, that the
vulgar Latin Translation is authenticall also.
               Thirdly, wee beleeue the written Word of
God to bee the ground of faith: you beleeue so,
but adde thereunto the vnwritten word.
               Fourthly, we beleeue, that Christ is the Head
of his Church: you beleeue so likewise, but
adde vnto him a visible Head, the Pope.
               Fiftly, we beleeue, that there are two places;
Heauen for them that shall bee saued, and Hell
for them that shall bee damned: you beleeue so
too, but adde thereunto other places more, Purgatorie,
Limbus patrum, and Limbus infantum.
               
               Sixtly, wee beleeue, that the true God is to
be worshipped in Spirit and truth: you beleeue
so too; but, you adde, that hee may bee analogically
and relatiuely worshipped by Images.
               
                  
Seuenthly, we beleeue▪ that we ought to call
vpon God: you beleeue so too; but adde heereunto,
that you may call vpon Saints.
               Eightthly, we beleeue, that Christ is our Mediator,
both of redemption and intercession: you
beleeue so too, but you adde to him Angels and
Saints, vpon whose intercession and merits you
in part relie.
               Ninthly, we beleeue; that the Saints departed
beare most ardent affection to the Saints liuing
vpon earth, and pray in generall for the Church
militant: you beleeue so too; but adde, that they
haue knowledge of our particular necessities, and
pray to God in speciall for vs.
               Tenthly, we beleeue, that Christ hath instituted
two Sacraments in his Church; Baptisme,
and the Eucharist: you beleeue so too, but adde
to them fiue other; Matrimonie, Penance, Ordination,
Confirmation, and Extreme Vnction.
               Eleuenthly, we beleeue, that grace is annexed
to the Sacraments in such sort, that all those who
worthily receiue them, participate also of sanctifying
grace: you beleeue so too; but adde, that
the Sacraments conferre this grace ex opere operato
(a worse Solecism in Diuinity, than in Grammar),
and that God is tied vnto them; so that all
children, dying without Baptism, are necessarily
damned.
               Twelfthly, wee beleeue, that the intention of
the Minister is requisite to the right administration
of the Sacrament: you beleeue so too; but

you adde, that the effect of the Sacrament dependeth
vpon the intention of the Minister.
               Thirteenthly, we beleeue, that in the Eucharist
the worthy Communicant really partaketh
of Christ's Body: you beleeue so too; but adde,
that Christ is receiued orally and carnally vnder
certain Accidents, the elements beeing transubstantiated.
               Foureteenthly, we beleeue, that we are iustified
and saued by the merits &amp; Passion of Christ:
you beleeue so too, but adde thereunto your
owne merits and satisfaction.
               Fifteenthly, we beleeue, that we ought to pray
for all the members of Christs militant Church
vpon earth: you beleeue so too; but adde therunto,
that wee may and ought to pray for the
Dead also.
               Sixteenthly, we beleeue and receiue the three
Creeds; the Apostles, the Nicene, and that of Athanasius,
and the foure generall Councels: you
beleeue them also, but adde a fourth Creed, viz.
the twelue new Articles coined by the Pope, and
annexed to the Councell of Trent.
               
               Thus you see how the Articles of our beleefe
are drawne out of your owne confessions. That
which wee hold for matter of faith necessary to
saluation, you (and, in a manner, all the Christians
in the world) hold as we. And therefore our
doctrine is Catholique, according to Vincentius
Rule, quòd ab omnibus, quòd vbique, quòd semper:
whereas your additions to the Catholique faith,

were neuer maintained, neither by all Christians
in any Age, nor by any Christians in all Ages.
Neither you, nor all the Papists in the world, are
able to proue any one point of your Trent-faith,
wherein you differ from vs, to be Catholique.
               And now let vs hear your Paralogisms against
my demonstration.
               
                  Obiect. 1. First, you say, it conuinceth not the
vnderstanding, and therefore is no demonstration.
               
                  Answer. This obiection of yours sheweth,
that you need to be informed in your vnderstanding,
how a demonstration conuinceth the vnderstanding.
It is not the property of a demonstration,
actually to conuince the vnderstanding,
but potentially or vertually. The meaning of this
Proposition, A demonstration conuinceth the vnderstanding,
is this; that A demonstration hath in it
power and strength to inforce the vnderstanding
of any intelligent man, to assent to the conclusion,
the premises beeing before apprehended by
him: and euery demonstration is a Syllogisme:
and euery Syllogisme proceedeth ex quibusdam
positis. To illustrate this by that vsuall example
of the eclipse of the Moon; which the Astronomers
demonstrate by the cause, to weet, the interposition
of the earth between the Sun and the
Moon. Before this demonstration will conuince
the vnderstanding of any man, he must first haue
the tearms expounded vnto him: afterwards he
must be taught, that the Moon hath not light of

her self, but receiueth it from the Sunne; thirdly,
that the Sunne casteth his light by right lines.
Fourthly, it must be shewed how, in such points,
called by Astronomers, Caput &amp; cauda Draconis,
the Sunne and Moone are diametrally opposed:
whereby it comes to passe, that, by the interposition
of the earth, the Moon is debarred from receiuing
light by the Sunne-beames. And thus
in the end, the vnderstanding is conuinced by this
demonstration.
               
                  That which is hindred from receiuing light
from the Sunne, by the interposition of the
earth, is eclipsed.
               
               
                  But the Moon, in the points aboue-named,
viz. the head and taile of the Dragon, is alwaies
hindred from receiuing light from the Sunne,
by the interposition of the earth:
               
               
                  
                     Ergo the Moon alwaies in those points is eclipsed.
               
               
                  Aquinas sheweth, that the vnderstanding of a
Ploughman is not conuinced by this demonstration,
but onely the vnderstanding of him who is
sufficiently fore-instructed in the tearms and suppositions
heerunto belonging. Therefore as this
demonstration conuinceth not the vnderstanding,
by the bare proposall of the Syllogisme;
but, the assent hauing been before wrought to
the premises, it enforceth and compelleth a rectified
vnderstanding to assent to the conclusion:
In like manner, I grant, that the bare proposall of
my former Syllogisme will not presently conuince

a man either vtterly ignorant, or in error, as
I feare you are, to assent to the perpetuall Visibility
of the Protestant Church. But if, as I enforced
you to assent to the Maior, so you would haue
but staied, and suffred mee to inforce the Minor,
will you, nill you, you should haue beene compelled
to yeeld to the conclusion.
               
                  But say you, in your worthy witty instance,
This Argument doth no more perswade a man, that the
Protestants are the true visible Church, then a man,
in case of doubt, can bee perswaded by the like Argument
which a man may make, to prooue himselfe and
his brethren to bee as well spoken of as any in the parish
thus:
               Those who are in heart honest men, are as well spoken
of as any in all the parish, &amp;c.
               Good Sir, let mee aduise you to obtaine a
writ of remoue for the Windmill: for the whirling
about of the sailes, wrought very much vpon
your braine, as you were a-printing this Answer
in the Cell. Had not you had a whimpsy in your
head, you would neuer haue set this your Paralogisme,
as a Parallel to my demonstration. In my
demonstration, the Maior, rightly vnderstood, is
vndoubtedly true, and de fide, as your selfe confesse,
page 23. The Scripture doth shew, the holy,
Catholique and Apostolique Church, both to
haue perpetuall vnchanged faith, and also to bee perpe
                        •
                     tually
visible. But in your Syllogisme, the Maior is
apparantly false. If honest men were alwaies wel
spoken of, how can the Apostles words stand, Sine

per famam,2. Cor. 6. 8. siue per infamiam, either by good report,
or by euill report, &amp;c? Nay, how can the
words of truth it selfe be verified,Mat. 5. 11. 
                  Blessed are yee
when men speake all manner of euill against you for my
sake? Againe, perpetuity of faith is the adequate
or selfe-sufficient cause of the perpetuall profession
thereof: but honesty in heart is not the cause
of fame, but honest and vertuous actions. It is
not the inward burning, but the outward shining
of our light before men, which maketh men to see our
good works, and thereby glorifie God in vs for them.
Yet by this your very instance and Syllogisme,
wee haue the better: and therfore, this your Syllogisme
may be fitly tearmed as you will haue it,
A demonstration, but with this addition of Fishers
folly. To be an honest man in heart, is both prius
naturâ, and morally eligibilius, in nature before, and
more desireable, then to be well spoken of. Mallem
de me dicas, Vir bonus est, ergo bonae famae, quàmè
contra. By this very argument, the Visibility of the
Church is but secundarium quid, and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , a
secundary proofe, and a common accident to the
truth of faith. And as wee therefore enquire of
fame, that we may know a mans vertue: so wee
therefore enquire of the true Church, as your
selfe confesse, Page 23. that by it wee may learne
the true faith. We seeke a guide, that we may finde
the way; and not the way, that wee may finde a
guide. If I can otherwise infallibly know a mans
vertue without fame, (put case he liued in a Desart)
I will not then set it vpon the triall of fame:

but in case I should faile of other proofe for a
probable Argument, I would produce fame.
In like manner, if wee had no other infallible
proofe of the true faith, then by the perpetuall
Visibility of the professors thereof, I would hold
it as you doe, a point of principall moment, to
enquire of the Visibility of professors: but sith
we haue another more easie, direct, and infallible
meanes to prooue it, viz. by comparing the
doctrine with the Canonicall Scriptures; you
shall giue me leaue, M. Fisher, rather to follow
this Method generally prescribed, and vsed by
the Antient Fathers, as I haue shewed before,
Assertion 7. then the other Method prescribed
by you.Touching the Visibility of the Church. Assertion 7.
               
               
                  Obiect. 2. Secondly, you charge my demonstration
with falshood in both the premises. The
Maior you say is false, for that there may bee a
Church or company, who may haue inward
faith, eternall and vnchanged; as for example, a
Church of Angels, &amp;c. An instance as wide from
the mark, as the heauen is distant from the earth.
Our question is of a visible Church of which all sorts
of men may learne infallible faith necessary to saluation.
Are Angels visible? Are all 
                     •
                  orts of men to learne
infallible faith of a Church of Angels? Doe you
hold it for a good interpretation, If thy brother offend
thee, tell the Church; that is, tell the Angels,
or a Church of Angels? Although Christ bee the
Head of Angels, and they make a part of the triumphant
Church in a large sense; yet I neuer

read of a Church of Angels. Bellarmine saith in expresse
tearmes, Lib. 3. de Eccles. Milit. cap. 12. Ecclesia
est Societas quaeda
                        •
                     m, non Angelorum, sed hominum.
The Church is a Society or company, not
of Angels, but of men. If I should haue brought
such an Argument, to proue the militant Church
vpon earth (of which we disputed) to bee inuisible,
because the Angels are inuisible; I should
haue suspected my selfe, to haue beene as wise
as hee that adored, for a Relique, one of the feathers
of the Angell Gabriels wings.
               
               Erubuit, salua res est, you seeme your selfe to
be ashamed of this Answer: and therfore you insist
not vpon it, but passe to the Minor, burdening
it with falshood; saying, The Protestants faith is not
vnchanged, but so often changed, and so much subiect
to change, as one may say, as a great person in Germany
once said of some Protestants, What they hold this
yeere, I doe in some sort know, but what they will hold
next yeere▪ I doe not know. I can requite you with a
like Apophthegme:
               
               The Popish faith is so subiect to change, that
wee may say of it, as a learned person in France
once said, That if a man would finde the Popish Tenets,
he must looke into an Almanack for them. At one
time, the murther of Kings is Catholique doctrine,
viz. in the time of the League against the
King of Nauarre. At another time, they pull in
that horne: and then for a season, such murder is
disauowed. That the Councell is aboue a Pope,
was Catholique Doctrine with you in Martin the

fifts time: it was not Catholique doctrine in
Leo the tenths.
               About the breaking vp of the Councell of
Trent, the edition of the vulgar byAnno Dom. 1590. 
                  Sixtus Quintus,
was authenticall, and not to bee reiected vpon
any pretence. Not long after, it was not authenticall:
ForAnno. Dom. 1592. 
                  Clemens the eighth corrected
it in many hundred places. Now goe and vpbrayd
vs with our late reuised translation: but
see withall, that you dispence with the Pope, that
he may dispence with you. One yeere the immaculate
conception of the blessed Virgin is
maintained in bookes allowed by your Church;
another yeere it is impugned. Lastly, in one yeere
it is determined in bookes set out by authoritie,
among you, that the oath of alleageance may
lawfully bee taken by Roman Catholiques: in
the next yeere wee reade, that hee is no good
Catholique that will take that oath. The title of
vniuersall Bishop was held insolent, arrogant,
profane, Antichristian, Luciferian, in Saint
                     Greg. Epist. l. 4. Epist. 78. &amp; 82. &amp; alibi. 
                  Gregories
time: but now you hold it to be the holy
title of Christs Vicar. Yea, but say you, The Protestants
haue no certaine and infallible rule, sufficient
to preserue them from change. Belike then, the
Scripture is no certaine and infallible rule; but
vnwritten traditions are: the Word of God is
no sure ground, the Popes Decree is. The Apostle
then hath much deceyued vs, who saith,
Let God bee true,Rom. 3 4. and euerie man a lyer. If euerie
man a lyer, euerie Pope too. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , homo, not

                  vir onely, to exclude Pope Ioane from priuiledge
of inerrability. You adde, to piece out your former
argument, that in my demonstration I proue
magis notum perignotius, viz. the visibilitie, which is
easily knowne, by the truth of Doctrine, which is more
hardly knowne, especially by onely Scripture; of the
sense whereof, according to the Protestants, who say,
The whole Church may erre, no particular man can bee
infallibly sure. The edge of this argument hath
beene turned alreadie in the Remonstrance;
whereunto I adde: First, that visibilitie is more
knowne to sense, then the truth of doctrine, but
not to the vnderstanding of a Christian. Secondly,
the visiblenesse of a particular present
Church is the obiect of sense; but not the perpetuall,
former, and future visibility of any one
Church, much lesse of the vniuersall. And therefore
it is much easier, out of plaine and euident
Texts of Scripture, together with the three
Creeds, knowne to the simplest among vs (where
the Liturgie is in a knowne Tongue) to deduce
the truth of doctrine necessarie to saluation, then
hee can produce a successiue Catalogue of visible
professours out of good Authors in all Ages.
Yea but no man, say you, can hee infallibly sure of the
sense of Scripture, because Protestants hold, The whole
Church may erre. In thus arguing, you bewray
either ignorance, or an ill conscience. Ignorance,
if you knowe not, that wee distinguish betweene
the essentiall or formal Church, and the Church
representatiue; of poynts necessarie to saluation,

and not necessarie; of euident Texts of Scripture,
&amp; of obscure. But if you knew these distinctions,
as indeed you cannot but knowe them (hauing
read D. Field and other Protestant Writers)
you dispute against your conscience. Because,
in obscure and difficult Texts of Scripture, the
Church may erre; will it therefore follow, that
no man can bee sure of the sense of plaine and euident
Texts? In which, if wee may beleeue

                     Aug. de doct. Christ. l. 2. c. 9. In iis enim quae aperte in Scriptura posita sunt, inueniuntur illa omnia, quae fide continent mores
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      viuendi.Saint Austin, all those things are found, which
concerne faith and manners. Will it follow, because
wee hold, that your Church representatiue,
that is, the Pope and his Consistorie, or the
Pope and his Councell may erre, that therefore
the essentiall and formal Church of Christ, consisting
of all the visible Christians in the world,
in propounding doctrine necessarie to saluation
out of Scripture, may erre? The Church following
her guide, the Word of God, is sure not to
erre, whether vniuersall or particular. For which
preseruation from errour, we doubt not, but that
there is a farre higher degree of spiritual assistāce
to the generall Councels, then nationall: yet in
both it sometimes falleth out, that, as Austen obserueth,
Priora à posterioribus emendentur: the
former are corrected by the later.
               Thirdly, you beg an Argument from your
selfe, drawne from a beggerly fallacy, called
Petitio principij, or begging your maine question.
You say, that my former Syllogisme was a petitio
principij, and therefore no demonstration: but I

prooued it then, and since confirmed it, that it
was a Demonstration, and therefore no petitio
principij. Let the Reader heere obserue, how
your Answers and Obiections interfere, and supplant
one the other. Master Sweet will haue my
Argument to bee a transitio à genere in genus; but
you, a petitio principij. Againe, elsewhere you
call this Argument, A digression from the question,
&amp; a diuersiue proofe, and yet here you will
haue it to bee identicall. Wherefore as Xenophanes▪
                  
opposed a motion made by Eleates,
                  
                     Arist. Rhet. l. 2. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . in
behalfe of Leucothea, to celebrate her funerals
with teares and lamentations, and withall to
sacrifice to her as a Goddesse: this motion, sayth
hee, ouerthroweth it selfe. If wee sacrifice to Leucothea
as an immortall Goddesse, we must not bewaile
her death: and if we bewaile her death, as being a mortal
woman, wee must not sacrifice to her, as to a Goddesse
priuiledged from death In like manner, whosoeuer
readeth your said seuerall Answers, may obiect against
them; If the Argument aboue-named, was
a petitio principij, it could not be a transitio à genere
in genus: and if it were a transitio à genere in genus,
it could not be a petitio principij. If it were a diuersiue
proofe, it could not bee identicall: if it bee
identicall, as you here affirme, it cannot be diuersiue:
for, it implyes an apparant contradiction,
to say,In prouing the same thing by the same thing, digresseth from the same thing. that a man, in proouing idem per idem,
doth digredi ab eodem. But you yeeld a reason
why this Argument beggeth or supposeth
that which is in question: For (say you) in asking

which is the true visible Church, or Congregation of
the true faithfull, wee aske, at least vertually, which is
the true faith. By the like reason, you might proue
euery Demonstration à priori, to bee a petitio principij:
For, in propounding any question touching
the effect, wee enquire vertually and implicitly
of the cause. And therefore Aristotle, in lib. 2.
Poster. Analyt. acutely prooueth, omnem quaestionem
esse quaestionem medij; that euerie scientificall
question is, in effect, a question of the medium
or the cause. By the like Argument you
might prooue, that all Arguments drawne à



definitione ad definitum, are petitiones principij: because,
in propounding any question touching
the definitum, wee, at least vertually, inquire of
the definition. If the tearmes in my Syllogisme
were but formally distinct, the Syllogisme could
bee no petitio principij: how much lesse then can it
bee termed petitio principij: when, as it is certaine,
they are distinct really, as your selfe confesse
in your fourth Argument: to which now I addresse
my selfe.
               
                  Fourthly, you impeach my Demonstration,
by pushing againe at the Maior; saying, Although
faith be prerequired to be in some or other members of
the true Church; yet inward faith alone, without some
outward profession, by which it is made visible, or sensible,
doth not sufficiently make a man to be a member of
the visible Church.
               It is a true rule in Philosophy: Vehemens sensibile
corrumpit sensum; the bright light of a Demonstration

so buzzardeth you, that you see not
where you are, nor knowe what you are about.
I am so farre from affirming, that inward
faith, without outward profession, maketh a visible
member of Christs Church; that from inward faith,
I inferre necessarily ex consequenti; outward profession,
which (as I sayd in the Conference)
makes a member of the visible Church. Doo
you grant the consequence, or deny it? If you
grant it, my Argument proceedeth: if you deny
it, confirmabit pro me vester Aristoteles, your great
Clerke,Lib. 3. de Eccles. Milit. cap. 13. Cardinall Bellarmine, makes good the
consequence in this manner: Qui non confitentur
fidem, sed, eâ in corde retentâ, exteriùs profitentur perfidiam
et idololatriam, non sunt boni, nec saluantur; cùm
ad Roman. 10. dicat Apostolus, Corde creditur ad iustitiam,
ore autem fit confessio ad salutem: et Mat. 10. Omnis
qui negauerit me coram hominibus, &amp;c. They are
not good men, nor shall bee saued, who do not
confesse the faith; but, keeping it in their hearts,
outwardly professe perfidiousnesse and idolatry:
For, the Apostle, Rom. 10. saith, With the heart
man beleeueth to righteousnes; but with the tongue man
confesseth to saluation: And Mathew 10. Whosoeuer
denieth me before men, him wil I deny before my Father
which is in heauen.
               
               Let Master Fisher therefore looke back vpon
my Argument, and demonstrate to me, though
à posteriori, what Academicall learning taught
him to deny it to bee a demonstration à priori.
               
            
            
               
               The Protestant Relation.
               Paragraph the ninth, touching
a testimony alleaged by Master Fisher,
out of Doctor Field.
               
                  Doctor Featly.
                  
                  That Church whose
faith, &amp;c.
                  But the faith of the Protestant Church
is the Primitiue Catholick faith, once giuen
to the Saints:
Ergo.
                  
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  I answer the Minor. If this
Proposition bee taken simply in it selfe, I absolutely
deny it: but if this proposition bee
considered (as it must bee) as related to the
first Question, and the end thereof, I further
adde, that it is not pertinent to that end, for
which the whole Dispute was intended; to
weet, to shew to those who are not able by their
owne ability to finde out the infallible faith,
necessary to saluation, without learning it of
the true visible Church of Christ: and, consequently,
the Visibility of the Church is first

to bee shewed, before the truth of Doctrine in
particular shall be shewed.
               
               
                  
                     D. Featly.
                  First, what speake you of
those who are not able by their owne ability
to finde out faith? Is any man able
by his owne ability, without the help of
diuine grace?
                  Secondly, what helpeth the Visibility,
to confirme the truth of the Church? Visibility
indeed prooues a Church, but
not the true Church.
                  Heere M. Fisher alleaged some words
out of D. Field, of the Church; supposing
thereby to iustifie his former Answer.
Whereunto D. Featly promised, Answer
should bee made, when it came to their
turne to answer; now hee was by order
to oppose M. Fisher.
                  
               
            
            
               Master FISHER his Answer.
               
                  These words either were not spoken, or M.
Fisher did not regard them, beeing in the midst of
his Answer: in which he went on, shewing the
necessity of a visible Church, by a saying of D.
Fields, viz.
                   Seeing the controuersies of Religion at
this day, are so many in number, and so intricate in
nature, that few haue time and leasure; fewer, strength

of wit and vnderstanding▪ to examine them: what remaineth
for men, desirous of satisfaction in things of
such consequence, but diligently to seeke out, which, among
all the Societies of men in the world, is that
Spouse of Christ, the Church of the liuing God, which
is the pillar of the Truth; that so they may embrace
her Communion, follow her direction, and rest in her
Iudgement?
               
               
                  M. Fisher therefore (I say) beeing busily speaking
this, did not regard what D. Featly did then
say, but might easily haue answered first, that he neuer
meant, that any were able of themselues, without help of
Gods grace, to attaine the true faith; which hindreth not,
but that some may haue that ability of wit and learning,
by which they can better examine controuersies of faith,
then those that want these abilities. Secondly, although
Visibility alone doe not prooue the true Church, yet it
(supposing Gods promises, that the true Church shall be
alwaies visible) much helpeth: and want of Visibility in
any one Age, prooueth a company not to bee the true
Church.
            
            
               Doctor FEATLY'S Reply.
               This parcell of your Answer containeth in it
an allegation out of D. Field, and an alleuiation or
mitigation of a speech of yours sauouring of Pelagianisme.
To your allegation out of D. Field,
I answer, Mitte quod scio, Die quod rogo. D. Fields
speech I acknowledge, which is very pertinent
to his end, but nothing to yours; that it is requisite

for all Christians, especially the weaker, to
fly to the Church, and hide themselues vnder
her wings, to preserue them from the danger of
Romish Kites, as D. Field prudently obserueth: so
no Protestant, to my knowledge, denieth. Our
Nouices and Catechumeni are taught, as to honor
God their Father, so also the Church their Mother.
Now, because the Whore of Babylon beareth her
selfe, as if shee were the Spouse of Christ, and
true Mother of all Christians; it is most behoouefull
to all those that haue care of the health
of their soules, to distinguish their true Mother
from a false harlot; the sincere milke, and wholsome
brests of the one, from the poysoned dugs
of the other: to which end, D. Fields Treatise
of the Church, is a singular help: which when
I reade, mee thinks I see that strong wrestler Iritarius,
                  
                     Plin. nat. histo. l. 1. cap. 20.so much innobled by Pliny, qui rectos 
                        •
                     t
transuersos celatim toto còrpore habuit neruos, who had
double sinnewes running acrosse ouer all his body:
so able, so sinewie a Writer is D. Field; who
hauing well traced true antiquity, doth in that
whole Treatise take vp your owne weapons, and
conquereth you with them: hee takes away your
strongest harnesse, in which you trust, I meane,
the Catholique Church; proouing it to bee ours,
not yours. To the authority of Scriptures (which
I here beginne at) hee addeth the consent of
the Church of the liuing God, the pillar of truth,
in whose determination and Communion, both wee
and you are to rest. But doe you, M. Fisher, in earnest

or with mentall reseruation, appeale to D. Fields
iudgement? Me thinks you draw the latch, as if
you meant to enter into the penetralia &amp; Clozet of
that work of the Church. If you bee willing so
to doe, I will leade you into the Entrie. Turne
me but the page ouer, you shall finde, before the
circuit of the sentence alleaged by you, be ended,
a Writ of Error sued against that Church,
which wil needs be the Mistresse and Mother of
the rest, nay, the whole Church. There hath
she her paterne from the Donatists, of appropriating
to her self the title &amp; priuiledges of the Church, excluding
all other from the hope of saluation. So the Romanists
cast into hel all the Christians of Greece, Russia,
Armenia, Syria, Aethiopia, because they refuse to be subiect
to the tyranny of the pope; as also the States &amp; kingdoms
of Europe, which haue freed themselues from their
Aegyptiacall bondage; That the Romanists abuse vs
with pretences of antiquity, vnitie, vniuersalitie, making
the simple beleeue, that al is antient which they professe,
and that the consent of all Ages is for them:
whereas it is easie to prooue, that all the things wherein
they differ from vs, are nothing but nouelties and vncertainties;
that the greatest part of the Christian
world hath been diuided from them for certaine hundreds
of yeeres; and more to that purpose: which
in that preface he promiseth, and in the tractate
prooueth. To which booke, me thinkes, M. Fisher,
or some other of his pew-fellowes, should vndertake
in order, proutiacet, to make answer, or
else neuer to haue beene so hardie, to cite that

Author, whose lines vpbraid them with i
                     •
                  abilitie
or negligence, so long as they suffer so learned
and laborious a treatisely bent point blank
against the walles of Rome to remain vnbattered.
               Now to your alleuiation: you say in that speech
of yours, concerning men not able, by their owne abilities,
to finde out the infallible faith: you meant not to
imply, that any were able of themselues, without helpe of
Gods grace, to attaine the true faith: I hope, you
meant not, because I trust that you are not sunke
so deepe into Pelagianisme. Yet you should haue
circumcised your lips and tongue, and kept better
the Apostles rule,1. Tim. 1. 13. 
                  to hold fast the for me of sound
words: for, what Christian eare can endure to
heare of men able, by their owne ability of wit or learning,
to find out faith? Wit and learning, I grant,
are Gods good gifts, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,
not to bee vnder-valued, much lesse contemned;
yet let me tell you, that wit and learning
without grace (such is the corruption of our
nature) rather hinder, then further our conuersion,
as Saint Austen writes in his confessions,
not with inke, but with teares: and on the contrary,
grace without eminent wit or learning, outstrips
naked wit &amp; learning, in our race to heauen.
Indocticoelum rapiunt, et nos cum doctrinis nostris, &amp;c.
               
               As for that which you adde, that Visibility
though alone it prooue not the true Church, yet
that it much helpeth to the proof thereof, I much
desire you to help me heere, in shewing me how

it much helpeth: for Visibility is but a common
accident, and I finde no topick place in Aristotle,
ab vno accidente communi ad subiectum. Suppose a
meere naturall man were to choose his religion,
and his Church, what will Visibility helpe him?
Besides, all sorts of Christian Churches, Iewish
Synagogues, Mahumetane and Gentile Congregations
are visible: will you say That is the truer
Church which is more visible? If you carrie it
away from vs by that marke, the Greek Church
will carrie it away from you; the Mahumetanes,
from the Greeke Christians; and the Idolatrous
Gentiles, from all. But this poynt hath bin handled
before in my sixt &amp; eight Assertion, touching
the Visibility of the true Church: therfore omitting
all farther prosecution of this point, and my
proofe by Syllogisme, I come now to iustifie
my induction.
            
            
               The Protestant Relation.
               Paragraph the tenth, touching
the induction and breaking vp of the
Conference.
               The Protestant Church was so visible,
that the names of those who taught
and beleeued the doctrine thereof, may be
produced in the first hundred yerees, and

second, and third, and fourth, et sic de caeteris,
and so in the rest: therefore it was so
in all Ages.
               First, I name those of the first Age: and
I begin with Him who is the beginning
of all, our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ,
blessed for euer, &amp;c.
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  Name of all Ages, or else you do
nothing.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  I cannot name all at once.
Will you haue me name men of so many
Ages, at one breath, &amp;c?
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  You shall not begin at Christ
and his Apostles.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  You are not to make my Induction:
I will begin with Christ and his
Apostles, &amp;c.
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  Name the rest in all Ages, and
then I will answer.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  First, answer to the first Age:
and then I wil proceed to the second, &amp;c.
               
               
                  
                     M. Fisher.
                  I will not answer you any thing,
till you haue made your Catalogue.
               
               
                  D. Featly.
                  
                  M. Fisher,I charge you, as
you will answer it before Christ himselfe
at the dreadfull day of iudgement, to answer

directly, whether Christ and his Apostles
taught our faith, or yours, &amp;c.
                  Notwithstanding this deep Charge,
M. Fisher still refused to answer to the argument
of instance in Christ and his Apostles,
&amp;c.
               
            
            
               Master FISHER'S Answer
by a Counter-relation.
               After this, D. Featly named, for the first Age,
our Lord and Sauiour Christ, and his twelue Apostles,
and Saint Paul, and Saint Ignatius. After which, he
staied awhile, as if he had studied for more Names: but,
not remembring any more whom he would set down for
the first Age, he said, These (not denying others) may
serue for the first Age.
               Then turning to M. Fisher, he said, Let vs dispute
of these. No, said M. Fisher: name, first, of all Ages.
What, said D. Featly? Will you not dispute of Christ
and his Apostl
                     •
                  es? Yes, said M. Fisher, in due place;
but first name the rest in all ages, and then I will answer
you. What, said D. Featly? Doo not Christ and
his Apostles deserue the first place? M. Fisher. I will
not answer, before you haue named the rest.
               Then said D. Featly in a heat, Well: you will not dispute
of Christ and his Apostles: then you grant Christ
and his Apostles to be Protestants. And so instantly,
without expecting M. Fisher's Answer, he turned himselfe
to the Audience, and said, Hee grants Christ and

his Apostles to be Protestants. Whereupon, diuers of
the Audience made such a shout, as if they had gotten a
victory; with such a noise, as M. Fisher, endeuouring
to answer, for a time could not be heard. But he rising
vp, and with his hand and voice crauing silence, made
such as would heare him, vnderstand, how falsely D.
Featly had slandered him to his face: and either then,
or vpon some like occasion, he said, What may I expect
behinde my back, when you thus mis-report mee to my
face?
               And in this sort, when many of the company
were willing to depart; D. Featly, beeing called vpon
(as it seemed) by some of his companions, to goe away,
did arise, and offer to be gone: yet, in his rising, he turned
to M. Fisher, saying, Will you dispute vpon Christ
and his Apostles, or no? To which M. Fisher said, I will,
if you will stay; and stretching out his hand, hee took
D. Featly by his arme, offering to stay him: yet hee, in
that abrupt manner, went away.
            
            
               Doctor FEATLY's Reply.
               This last passage hath been so duely pondered
by those honourable, reuerend, and worshipfull
Personages, who haue set their hands to the Attestation,
that, to adde any more to that which
is there most exactly discussed, were to offer post
Protogenem lineam ducere, to draw a line after
the most curious painter. The matter of fact then
beeing cleered by witnesses beyond all exception,
I owe nothing to M. Fisher for his Counter-relation,

saue onely satisfaction to a similitude of
debt, wherewith hee thinkes hee payes mee
home, pag 61.
            
            
               Master FISHER'S reflection, cap 3.
               To do as Doctor Featly did, is no fit way to giue satisfaction
to all sorts, expecting resolution of the aforesaid
most important question: As it were a very insufficient
way, to giue satisfaction in a debt of twentie
pieces of gold to another his creditour, if in stead of actuall
payment required, hee should say and offer to proue
by a syllogisme, yea, by a demonstration à priori, that
he can pay him the said twentie pieces, and being vrged
to lay downe the particular peeces of gold, hee saith, that
by an induction hee will lay downe those pieces of gold
one after another; and being farther pressed to doe so,
hee, not hauing one piece of gold of his owne, taketh
out of his creditors purse, one or two, or more pieces;
and laying downe one or two of them, saith, Lo, here is
one or two towards the twentie: and being neuer so
much vrged, he will not lay downe any more, vntill
his creditour first dispute with him, whether these two
or three pieces laid downe bee his owne or no: and being
hereupon seriously told by his creditour, that vnlesse he
laid downe all the pieces of gold, hee did not satisfie the
debt, but lost his credit and forfeited his band; he then
falleth into passion, and saith, What? will you haue
mee eat my dinner at a bit? I cannot lay downe all
at once. Will you dispute with mee about these, or no?
Which his creditor refusing to doe, vntill all the twentie

pieces bee actually laid downe; hee lastly saith, Well,
you will not dispute about these: you grant these to bee
mine. And so, without expecting answer, hee turneth
to the companie, saying, Hee granteth these to bee mine,
and taketh vp his cloke, and runneth away, not regarding
that his creditour, so soone as hee can open his
mouth, biddeth him stay, and denieth anie such grant
to haue been made by him; yea, offereth to dispute with
him of that poynt, if hee will stay. I suppose, no man
will thinke this kinde of dealing, to bee an honest and
good satisfaction in a debt of monie: and therefore
much lesse should it bee accounted good in matters of for
more importance and value, and specially in satisfying
this (by Doctor Featly vndertaken) debt, of shewing
names of visible Protestants in all ages out of good Authors.
            
            
               Doctor FEATLY'S Reply.
               Wee haue had triall before of your Grammar,
Logicke, and Philosophie, and heer now
you giue vs a cast of your Rhetoricke. The parts
of a good similitude, called Protasis and Antapodosis,
ought to be like two eyes looking one way,
and not asquint: else they make not a similitude,
but a dissimilitude. Let vs then view the aspect
and cast of these your eyes. As a man, who being
to pay a debt of twentie pieces or pounds to
another his creditour,Protasis. in stead of actuall paying,
offers to proue by a Syllogisme, that hee can pay
him: and afterwards being pressed, not hauing

one piece of gold of his owne, taketh out one
or two pieces out of his creditours purse, and
layeth them downe, and will lay no more
downe, vntill his creditour first dispute with
him whether the pieces laid downe be his owne
or no. And the creditour refusing so to doe, till
the whole summe were laid downe, hee the
debtor taketh vp his cloke, and runneth away:
Euen so Doctor Featly,
                  Antapodosis. being to proue the visibilitie
of the Protestant Church, first proued it
by a demonstration à priori, and afterwards, at the
importunitie of his aduersarie, vndertooke also
to proue it à posteriori, by producing a catalogue
of Names from Christ to Luther; and hee began,
recto et naturali ordine, with the first age, instancing
in Christ and his Apostles, very earnestly
pressing and vrging, yea and adiuring also Master
Fisher to answer this instance: And vpon Master
Fishers finall and peremptorie refusall thereof, he
was pulled away by the companie, and not suffered
to argue any longer with such a one, that
refused to answer Christ and his Apostles.
Hold hooke and line, and the Fisher shall catch
a Gudgeon. I grant, a Similitude needeth not currere
quatuor pedibus, runne vpon foure feet; yet
certainly it is a very bad Similitude that is lame
of all foure, as this is; and therefore cannot draw
Dunne out of the mire. First, to produce a Catalogue
of Names, was no debt, but rather a merit
or worke of supererrogation: for the visibilitie of
the Protestant Church may bee, and hath beene

sufficiently defended, and demonstratiuely proued,
without producing any catalogue of names:
and therefore your similie limpeth on the first
foot.
               Secondly, to proue the visibilitie of the
Church by a demonstration à priori, is not to pay
a debt, by offering to proue, that a man can pay
it; but actually to pay it in the purest gold,
whereas it had been sufficient to pay it in ordinarie
siluer or coorser gold. For, a demonstration
à priori, as farre exceeds a demonstration à posteriori,
as gold doth siluer, or the finest Angel gold
baser coine of the same metall; and therefore
your similie halteth on the second foot.
               Thirdly, to instance in Christ and his Apostles,
was not to lay downe two pieces for twentie,
but to lay downe a Diamond worth manie millions,
in stead of twentie peeces: for if the Poet
could say,Cic. Orator. 
                  Plato mihi instar millium: Plato is to mee
in stead of a thousand; how much more may a
Christian, especially a Protestant Christian say,
Christ and his Apostles are to me in stead of millions
of witness
                     •
                  s? Neither is it an idle ma
                     •
                  ter, as
in your ridiculous similie you would imply, but
a matter of the greatest importance of all, to enquire
whether Christ and his Apostles bee ours
or yours: and therefore your similitude halts
downe-right on this third foot.
               Fourthly, it is not all one, after a man hath
laid downe two pieces, to stay till they bee
weighed, before hee lay downe any more, and

simply to refuse to lay downe any more. It is one
thing, voluntarily to goe away; and another
thing, to bee puld away by those of his friends
whom hee hath cause most to respect; and therefore
your similie is lame also on the fourth foot:
and how then can it stand vpright, much lesse
goe for currant? Nay, the most beggerly cripplenesse
of this long-robed comparison, is in the
begging as granted that which is the moment
and ground of the whole question. Hee putteth
the case, that the debter tooke the two pieces
out of the creditours purse. Surely, a blind or
verie credulous creditor, that would stand still
till the debter picked his pocket. O patience!
Good Sir Creditor, if you can, vpon your credit,
make good, that those whom you intend by
the two tendered pieces of coyne, namely,
Christ and his Apostles, are the proper legacy
and riches of the Romane treasurie, take vs your
bondmen in stead of payment of the rest. But if
this field, wherein this precious pearle lyeth, bee
by good title ours (as I then would, and at any
time hereafter can proue) I think, vpon such conuiction,
you will haue small courage to clamour
for the rest of your twentie. Doe but looke on
this coyne, though loth, and see whose image
and superscription it carryeth: is it not the liuely
indeleble Character of our Sauiours Charter,
the Scriptures? They are ours by Christ; Christ
ours by them.
               The Roman pouch is so stuffed with Traditions,

so choaked with counterfait ouergilt Copper
of new-minted Articles, that Christ, and his
Apostles, and Euangelists, cannot bee admitted;
nay, will not bee embased, to bee mingled with
such drosse. But I wonder that you dwell so long
vpon a money-Similie. I thought you had vowed
pouerty, and might not touch siluer. I haue
heard of some of your orders, that if they touch
coyne, it blisters their hands: as it is reported of
a certaine Lady, that if a Rose-leafe bee put vpon
her hand as shee is asleep, it will make it blister.
But it seemeth to mee, that you are Theocritus his
Fisher; you fish for gold; and, if you are not
wronged, haue caught no small number of golden
gudgeons in your net, and transported them
beyond the seas, carrying, Rem ad non res, no smal
stock to English Nunneries, I had almost sayd Iesuitisses
or Loyolasses. And if you will needes
haue a Similie from paying monie, to illustrate
this passage in the conference, thus you may
frame it: Suppose a Catalogue for sixteene-hundred
yeeres which haue runne since Christ,
to bee sixteen-hundred pound: suppose the
hundred yeeres to bee a hundred pound: I, by
producing a Catalogue of visible Protestants
in the first age, lay downe a hundred pound of
the summe, and bid you tell it after me, and then
demand of you, whether the summe bee right?
You answer, that you will tell mee, after you
haue told the whole summe of 1600. pounds. I
presse you again &amp; againe, to answer concerning

this first summe, whether it be right or no: if it be
right, I promise to lay down al the rest in the like
manner. You answer as before, Lay downe the
rest, or you shall not begin with the first &amp; next heap,
but with the last in cōclusion. I charge you, as you
wil answer it at your peril to your Master, whose
factor you pretend to bee, to giue-ouer all cauilling,
&amp; plainly &amp; directly to answer me, whether
this first sum be right or not: and when, notwithstanding
this deep charge, you trifle &amp; cauill, the
witnesses, who were to set their hands to my acquittāce,
pul me away, saying, You shal deale no more
with such a cauilling factor. This is a true &amp; perfect
embled of the breaking vp of the Conference:
wherewith I will breake vp my defence thereof.
            
            
               The Protestant Relation.
               Paragraph the eleuenth, touching
the issue of the Conference.
               This Conference, though it took not
that progresse which was desired, by reason
of the Iesuites tergiuersation, not permitting
D. Featly to come to the ripenesse
of any Argument; yet it hath not beene
fruitlesse: for since that time, the aforesaid
M. Bugges came to Sir Humfrey Lynde,
and gaue him many thankes for the said

meeting, and assured him that hee was
well resolued now of his Religion; that
hee saw plainely it was but the Iesuites
bragging without proofes: and whereas
formerly, by their sophisticall perswasions,
hee was in some doubt of the
Church, hee is now so fully satisfied of
the truth of our Religion, that hee doth
vtterly disclaime the Popish Priests
company, and their doctrine also.
            
            
               Master FISHER'S Answer.
               I haue cause to doubt, that this which the Relator
saith, is not true: for thereby hee maketh the old Gentleman
to bee but of a weake capacity, or of a very mutable
nature: for first, I am sure there was no cause giuen
in the Conference, of any such effectuall resolution,
to bee made by the old Gentleman. Secondly, I cannot see
when this speech should bee made by the Gentleman to
Sir Humfrey. If immediately after the Conference,
it would argue too much want of capacitie: for if hee
did but rightly conceiue the true state of the Question,
in which himselfe had especially desired to bee satisfied
(as I verily hope hee did) hee might easily haue marked
the insufficiencie of D. Featly his diuerting proofes;
which also were so answered, as the audience, for want
of satisfaction in them, vrged him to leaue off, and 
                     〈◊〉
                  
produce names of Protestants in all Ages; the which

producing of names beeing so oft and earnestly required
to bee done in all Ages, and yet beeing onely pretended
(and that most falsely) to be done for one Age, and the
Conference beeing so abruptly left off by D. Featly, before
he would goe forward to name men in other Ages,
especially in Ages before Luther; at the question required; any meane capacitie might see, that the Question in
which the old Gentleman desired to bee satisfied; was
not fully answered, nor consequently hee satisfied.
               Moreouer, the same Gentleman beeing present;
when the Earle of Warwick told M. Fisher, that D.
Featly should at another time come againe to giue
names of Protestants in other Ages, hee might easily,
and doubtlesse did vnderstand; that as yet 
                     〈◊〉
                   in all
Ages were not giuen, nor consequently, the Question
satisfied, in which hee expected Answer. Furthermore,
presently after hee went away from the Conference,
hee told M. Fisher himselfe, that hee was glad,
that at the next meeting his Question should bee answered:
which shewed, that as yet he did not conceiue it
to be answered.
               Lastly, diuers dates after all the trouble and
stirre was past (which was made about the Conference)
the old Gentleman was not 
                     •
                  ore solute a Protestant (as
the Relator pretendeth) for meeting M. Fisher, and
M, Sweet, hee desired them to giue him a Catalogue of
names of Professors of the 
                     〈…〉
                   that if
after this the Doctors should not giue him a Catalogue
of Protestants hee should dislike their cause: Which
Catalogue, M. Fisher, and M. Sweet haue ready for
him, but will not deliuer, till he get the Doctors to make

theirs ready, that hee bring to them the Doctors Cat
                     •
                  
                  logue
with one hand, and receiue theirs with the others, to
deliuer to the Doctors.
               All that can bee suspected, is, that in the very
time of the said stir, when the old Gentleman either was,
or feared to bee called in question; it may perhaps bee,
that he might say those words, which the Relator mentioneth.
But this (if it were) was onely vpon fra
                     •
                  ltie or
humane feare of trouble, and not any firme and settled
resolution grounded vpon the Conference, sith both before
and after, he shewed a contrary minde, as hath beene
said.
            
            
               Doctor FEATLIE'S Reply.
               What you repeat in this passage, touching
my proceedings in the Conference, hath beene
before vpon diuers occasions answered; and I
endeuour, as much as may bee, to auoyd your
familiar figure of battologie or repetition. For, that
which concerneth M. Bugges, that hee receiued
satisfaction by the Conference, and gaue many thankes
to Sir Humfrey Lynd for procuring it, and not as
you imagine, when the trouble was about the
Conference, but the selfesame night, in the very
roome wherein we conferd, is not onely proued
by Sir Humfrey Lynde his testimonie, but also by
M. Bugges owne subscription, both to the Protestant
Relation in generall, and to this passage
in particular, and that of late, since all pretended
trouble was blowne ouer. Now M. Fisher, you

are a very merry man, that will goe about to
face a man out of his beliefe, and dispute him out
of that peace and comfort which hee feeleth in
his consciecne. M. Bugges may well answer you
in the words of Saint Austen, spoken to another
purpose, Tu ratiocinare: ego credam, &amp;c. Doe you
syllogize: I will beleeue. Demand you a reason,
if you list: I will giue thankes. Argue as long
as you please, How I could bee resolued
by the Conference? I am sure, I was resolued,
and so still continue. When the Philosopher in
A. Gellius, sophistically disputed against motion
in this manner:
               
                  Whatsoeuer is mooued locally, is either mooued
in the place wherein it is, or wherein it is
not. It cannot be mooued in the place wherein
it is not, because that is not to mooue locally,
or in place: where the body hath no existence,
it can haue no motion. Neither can a body be
said to mooue in the place wherein it is, because
while a body remaines in its place, it cannot
mooue from it: One of his Auditors there
present, whose arme a little before had beene put
out of ioynt; though hee could not verbally
answer that his sophisme, yet hee really refeld it
thus, At ego sensi motum luxato brachio, I am sure I
felt a motion when I hurt my arme, and put the
bone out of ioynt. In like manner, when you argue,
that M. Bugges could not be mooued by any
thing that was spoken in the Conference, because
his Question was not answered; or the

Catalog
                     •
                  e of names not produced; or because D.
Featlyes proofs were diuersiue; or because the Popish.
Audience still called for names; or because
you and M. Sweet are not yet satisfied: or because
I know not what: M. Bugges, in a word refutes all
your reasoning, At ego sensi motum, I am sure I felt
my selfe mooued by it: and the doubt which
sometimes shook my faith, remooued: So that
I wa
                     •
                   thereby, not (as the other) put out of ioynt,
but in ioynt; and of lame, made whole. Neither
will it hence follow, that M. Bugges must needs
bee a man of meane capacity, if hee were satisfied
by so short a Conference; but rather that God
oftentimes vseth weake meanes to ouerthrow
Satans strong holds. Firmus the Maniche was
reclaimed from that heresie, by a digression of
Saint Austens, in a certaine Homily. Alipius
was drawn from heathenish sports and pastimes,
by an example, in a discourse of Saint Austens on
the By. That noble Venetian Marquesse, who left
both his Marquisate, and all that hee had, for
the loue of the Gospell, and comfortably
ended his daies at Geneuae, was at the first reformed,
both in his faith and life, by an elegant
Simile in a Sermon of Peter Martyrs. Sometimes
an exquisite Sermon taketh not the Auditory;
and sometimes a farre meaner taketh: now and
then a stronger Argument worketh not vpon the
vnderstanding and will; and yet a weaker proofe
doth at the same time. You cannot bee ignorant
of the Story in Ruffinus, of an Arrian Philosopher,

of whom the learned Bishops in the Councell
could get no ground at all: yet a simple
vnlearned man, by two or three blunt Interrogatories,
conquered and quite confounded him.
Wil you from this, and the like instances, inferre,
that the men so conuerted, were men of meane
capacity? The contrary euidently appeares in
Story: you should rather from hence gather with
religious Austen (who may truly be said to 
                     〈◊〉
                  
written, rather ex gratia, then degratia, so gratiously
doth hee write of grace) totum Deo dare, qui voluntatem
hominis bonam et praeparat adiuuandam,Enchirid. ad Laurent. et
adiuuat praeparatam; in our first conuersion, and
euery good work after, to ascribe all to God, who
both prepares the will to be aided by grace, and aideth it
beeing prepared.
               
               Yea, but say you, M. Bugges much desired a second
meeting: therefore it seemes, he was not so
resolute a Protestant as wee make him. If this
were a good Argument, you might prooue all of
our side to be vnsettled in our Religion; yea, M.
Deane of Carlile, and my selfe also, who much
desired, and yet doe, a second meeting, to perfect
the work then begun. Though a man be neuer
so well resolued in poynt of Religion, yet hee
may desire to heare Diuinity-Disputations, and
make good vse of them. Yea, but M. Bugges desired
M. Fisher and M. Sweet to giue him a Catalogue
of names of professors in the Romane
Church; saying, that if after this, the Doctors
would not giue him a Catalogue of Protestants,

hee would dislike their cause. If M. Bugges spake
so (which I haue reason to doubt) hee spake it,
as hauing certaine knowledge, that we had a Catalogue,
which hee did or might haue seene in
the Conference. Nor indeed doth the desiring
or requiring of a Catalogue, inferre any doubt of
the conclusion. Though a plaine vnlearned
Christian beleeue most firmely, that Christ was
borne of the seed of Abraham and Dauid, yet
may he desire more particular information, by
hearing the beginning of Saint Mathews, or Saint
Lukes Gospell read and expounded to him. Moreouer,
when I vndertooke to name those who
taught Protestant Doctrine in all Ages, if I
should faile therein, he should haue had iust cause
to dislike my proceedings. Yea but, say you,
there was no cause giuen in the Conference at
all, of any effectuall resolution to be made by
the old Gentleman: therefore he could not bee
so resolued by it, as is pretended. For answer
heereunto, though I am loth, yet you constraine
mee to recapitulate the chiefe points touched in
the Conference. Before the Conference, M.
Bugges was somewhat staggered in the poynt
touching the Visibility of the Church, by your
brauadoes, and Rhodomontadoes, that all the world
were Papists before Luther; That there was neither
vola nor vestigium of a Protestant Church before that
time;A briefe recapitulation of the Conference. That no Protestant Minister durst encounter you
in this point: if any should be so hardy, as to enter into
these lists with you; you would presently blank, silence,

and nouplus them. Thus possessed, and in some sort
perplexed by your bold and confident assertions
and false suggestions; hee with much adoe,
by Sir Humfrey Lyndes meanes, procures a Conference:
wherein hee findes all things otherwise
then hee might expect. Hee and all the Auditory
obserued D. White, and my selfe, to bee very
ready and earnest to proceed in the Questions;
both to prooue the Visibility of our Church, and
disprooue theirs. On the contrary, he could not
but see you to cast all manner of Remoraes and
rubs, to hinder speedie and direct proceedings:
and for the Questions touching the Visibility of
the Church,
               First, hee heard, that the perpetuall Visibility
of the Church, beeing a point of faith, was
not to bee built vpon deduction from humane
Stories and good Authors, as the Iesuite required;
but vpon diuine reuelation in Gods Word,
as is confessed by
                     Bellarmine loc. sup. cit. Canus loc. l. 11. c. 4. praeter auctores sacros nullum historicum certum esse posse et 
                        •
                     doneum, ad faciendum certam in theologia fidem. learned Papists.
               Secondly, that a Protestant Church might
haue beene visible in all Ages, and yet not the
names of visible Protestants now to bee produced,
and prooued out of good Authors, because
neither all mens names euer were vpon record,
nor are all antient Records preserued to
this day, neither can wee come by all those Records
that are yet extant.
               Thirdly, that notwithstanding the Popish brag,
that All the Christian world were Papists before Luther;
yet you were not able to name any Countrey,

City, Village or Hamlet, nay not any man,
who for 500. yeeres and more after Christ, either
professed your Trent-faith in generall, or those
fifteene points recited in the Conference in particular.
               Fourthly, that the surest and strongest meanes
to prooue the perpetuall Visibility of a Church,
was á priori, by the conformity of it's faith to the
Scriptures: of which faith, God promiseth in
his Word, that it shall haue visible Professors to
the worlds end.
               Fiftly, that a visible Church inferrs not necessarily
a right faith. Iews, Mahumetanes, Gentiles,
and diuers sorts of blasphemous Hereticks, haue
visible professors of their impieties: yet are
they all of a wrong beliefe; if of any on the contrary,
the right faith inferreth necessarily a visible
Church, because the true faith cannot bee
in a Church, which professeth it not openly, or
priuately: therefore the prime and maine question
of all is, of the right beliefe, of the primitiue
and Catholique faith, whether wee or the
Church of Rome haue it; and not of a Catalogue
of names.
               Sixtly, that an offer was made, to name some
eminent persons, which in al Ages taught Protestant
Doctrine, and opposed the Romish errors,
either when they came in, or not long after; and
that this Catalogue had beene a good way proceeded
in, if you had not beene the cause by
your delayes and tergiuersations.
               
                  
Lastly, that when I instanced in Christ and his
Apostles, and vrged you againe and againe, yea
and adiured you also to answer directly, whether
they taught our faith or yours; yet you peremptorily
and finally refused so to doe: which
hee might well interpret, to proceed from your
apparant distrust in your cause.
               And now let the discreet Reader iudge, whether
M. Bugges had not reason to alter his opinion
concerning you and your cause, at least in that
particular, of which only he seemed to doubt of.
            
         
         
            
               Shortly after the Conference,
M. Fisher sent this Letter ensuing,
to the right honorable the
Earl of WARVVICK.
               The Copie of M. Fisher's Letter.
               
                  RIGHT HONOVRABLE LORD:
               
               
                  I Esteeme it a speciall prouidence of God, that your
Lordship was present at a late Conference, wherein
D. White and D. Featly vndertook to shew against
mee and my companion, that the Protestant
Church had beene visible in all Ages, and that their
Professors might be named, especially in the Ages before
Luther. Your Lordship may remember the substance
of all the proofe to haue consisted in this, that The true

Church was alwaies so visible, as the Professors thereof
in all Ages might be named: but the Protestants was
the true Church. Wee refused to dispute of the Minor,
because it transferd the Question, and auoyded that
plaine proofe of the visible Church, which was then propounded
and expected. If▪ as they conclude, they are
able to name their Professors in all Ages, why did they
refuse to giue vs a Catalogue of theirs, as we were ready
to haue giuen them another of ours? Why went they
about to prooue they were able to name them, when with
lesse adoe they might haue named them? Where deeds are
iustly expected, words without deeds are worthily neglected.
               Certainely, heereby they are so farre from hauing discharged
themselues of the great enterprize they vndertook,
as they stand more engaged then before, to the performance
of it. For, hauing now professed and acknowledged,
that the true Church, or (to vse their owne
words) the Church that is so visible as the Catholick
Church ought to bee (and the Church,
whose faith is eternall and vnchanged, must bee),
is able to name her Professors in all Ages, either
for their owne honour, and for the satisfaction of the
world, they must set down the names of their Professors
in all Ages; or else they shamefully discouer themselues,
not to be that true and visible vnchanged Church, which
is able to name them. Againe, at the length yeelding (as
they did) to shew the continual Visibility of their Church,
by a full induction of their visible Protestants in all
Ages, (which they seemed to vndertake with great confidence),
why did they stick in the first Age alone, refusing

to name their professors in the Ages following, vntill
the first were tried? May not the Answerer choose to
deny which part of the Argument hee pleaseth? and was
it euer heard, that hee should bee inforced to reply to one
proposition alone, before the whole Argument, whether
it were Syllogism or Induction, were fully propounded?
Very nobly therefore, and prudently your Lordship in the
end desired anothe
                     •
                   meeting; not doubting, that your
owne partie, within three or foure daies would be content
to giue vs the names of their Professors in all Ages,
as wee were ready to giue them the names of ours, that
thereby both sides might bee the better prepared for a second
triall: which when they haue performed, wee shall
not faile to encounter with them, either by way of speech
or writing, as your Lordship (all things considered)
shal think fairest, or safest, or most conuenient for the discouery
of truth. But if your Lordship shall not bee able
to obtaine at their hands this your most iust and import
                     •
                  nt
request, the defect of proofe on their part must needs
bee accounted a plaine flight, and no man heereafter can
prudently rely his saluation vpon that Church, which
(for want of perpetuall Visibility prooued) they themselues
shall haue concluded to be false and feigned.
               Thus expecting the issue heereof, and your Lordships
further pleasure from the mouth of this bearer, I
remaine, the first of Iuly 1623.
               
               
                  Your Lordships seruant in Christ,
IOHN FISHER.
               
            
            
               
               Doctor Featlie's Answer to M. Fisher's
Letter.
               IN perusing this Letter of yours, I could not
but think of the old riddle, Hom
                        •
                      
                     
                        〈…〉
                     ,
videns non videns, lapidem non lapidem, &amp;c. A
man, no man, (that is, an Eunuch) seeing, not seeing
(that is, seeing dimly, being 
                     •
                  urblind) a stone,
no stone (that is, a pumice): for, heere is a priuate
Letter, no Letter, relating, not relating, the
substance of my Argument, not my Argument.
               First, it may bee call'd a priuate Letter, because
it was seald vp like a priuate Letter, and indorsed
to an Honorable Personage; yet it was no priuate
Letter: for, diuers copies of it were dispersed
and read, before the Earle receiued it, who heard
of it, before hee read it. His Lord-ships name
was set vpon it, onely to make it more passable,
and to giue vent for such cheating wares, as
Master Fisher thought, would passe more currant,
by a Letter addressed to so Noble a Personage.
               Secondly, it relateth, and not relateth, because
it omitteth much more then it relateth: for the
Introduction in the beginning, and the Induction
in the end of the Conference, and all my Replies
in the middle, they are all not circumcised only,
as the Argument here relateth, but quite cut out.
               Thirdly, it relateth my Argument, not my Argument;
my Argument, because propounded in
most of my words: yet not my Argument, because
not according to my meaning, when I disputed

thus in the Conference: The Church whose
faith is perpetuall and vnchanged, is so visible, or
ought to bee so visible, that the names of the Professors
thereof may be shewed in all Ages. I argued not so,
according to my owne opinion, but as it is expresly
set downe in the Conference, ex concessis,
vpon your owne ground: vpon which to supplant
you, I held it a great disparagement to
your cause: and therefore, in repeating the Argument
againe, I expresly added, as you your
selfe confesse, That Church which holdeth this faith,
you beleeue (I said not, wee) to bee so visible,Page 19. as
that the names of the Professors may be shewed, &amp;c. In
the very entrance to the Conference, you acknowledge
these to haue beene my words: although
this Question be grounded on vncertain
and false supposals: for, a Church may haue
beene visible, yet not the names of all Professors
thereof now to bee shewed.Page 32. And againe, Are all
visible mens names vpon record? are all Records in former
times, now to bee produced? And againe, in the
same page, M. Sweet calling for names of Protestants,
well might say, If Protestants had beene in
all Ages, their names in euery Age might bee produced.
Vnto which, as the Protestant Rel
                     •
                  tor

                     •
                  aith, and the Counter-Relator denieth it not,
D. Featly replyed, saying, This is a non sequitur.
Out of all which passages it euidently appeares,
that both you in this your Letter, and L. D.
otherwise M. Sweet, in the defence of the Appendix,
bely your owne consciences, in saying, that

I professed (out of mine owne iudgement &amp; opinion)
that the true Church must be able to name
Professors in all Ages. It is true, as Brasidas the
Lacedemonian ran thorow his Aduersary with
his owne Speare;Erasm. Apophtheg.
                   so I took that proposition, tanquam
hastam amentatam, from you, to wound you
with your owne weapon. And although I needed
not at all to haue descended to an Induction,
or produced any Catalogue of such as maintained
Protestant Doctrine by name: yet the more
to conuince you, and to satisfie some of the Auditory,
I beganne a Catalogue, and had proceeded
farther in it, if I had not beene called away
by those, whose Authority and Loue might
command mee; who would not suffer mee to
deale any longer with an aduersary so atheologicall,
and alogicall, so irreligious and vnreasonable;
so irreligious to refuse, finally and peremptorily,
to answer an instance in Christ and
his Apostles; beeing vehemently pressed, and
not without adiuration: Secondly, so vnreasonable,
to require an Opponent to prooue at once,
eminent professors for 1500 yeeres, to haue
taught Protestant Doctrine. Was there euer any
that vndertook to make good a catalogue of Professors
in all Ages, who did not first prooue, that
there were such in the first Age, and then in the
second, et sic de caeteris, and so in the rest? Was
there euer a Respondent, who vndertook to
answer an Argument by Induction of particulars,
consisting of 15 or rather 15 hundred particulars

(and al in his iudgement questionable) who
did not answer them piece-meale in order, first
applying his Answer to the first particular, and secondly
to the second, &amp;c? I cannot patterne you
better, then by that malefactor, who hauing stolne
my Oxen, and beeing indited for them seuerally,
would not answer directly to the first enditement,
Guilty or not guilty; but said; still that hee had
that Oxe with his fellowes; heereby hoping,
vpon tryall of the whole in one lump, to escape
by his book, or benefit of Clergie, as wee call
it. In like manner, when you were put to it,
to answer directly, Whether the Protestant
Professors were not visible in the first Age, and so
in the second, and so in the third, &amp;c? you answer,
It was not visible in the first Age, with the
rest, nor in the second with the rest, and further
you will not goe. The difference betweene you,
is onely this, He answered so shufflingly and
confusedly, to saue his neck; and you, to saue the
rack of an Argument; he, to slip out by his Clergy;
you, by your vnclerkly Sophistry. You may
bee sure, such kinde of foggie and misty answering,
could no way satisfie a man of so cleere a
iudgement and apprehension in controuersies of
this nature, as the Earle of Warwick is. Which
that you may the better know from his own pen,
I will acquaint you with a Letter wrote by occasion
of this businesse, by his Lordship, and addressed
to Sir Humfrey Lynde.
               
            
            
               
               To my louing friend Sir
Humfrey Lynde.
               SIR, since my beeing at your house at the
Disputation of M. Doctor Featly and Fisher,
diuers haue come vnto mee, to know whether
it was a Disputation appointed by me, or no;
and whether I was not satisfied with it. Whereby
I perceiue, those that learne the doctrine of equiuocation,
will not spare to tell a plaine lye, to doe
any man wrong that is not of their opinion. And
I am the more confirmed in this opinion: for,
since last night, M. Plume came to mee, and deliuered
this enclosed letter, which I much maruell
at. I would not answer it, but thus: that I would
speake with you, and that M. Fisher should not
need feare, that D. Featly would flee from him,
but meet him at any time, to make good his Tenet.
I had thought to haue spoken with you my
selfe, but my earnest occasions pressed mee to go
this day into the countrey. Wherefore, if you
meet, I pray let the company know, for the meeting,
that I knew of it but halfe an howre before
it was, and I came at the request of another Gentleman,
and for no desire of mine to be satisfied:
for I thank God, my conscience makes no doubt
of the truth of our Religion. This I say, because
I heare that some of that Religion giue it out, It

was my request to haue a Disputation. I pray
keepe M. Fishers Letter till I see you, and restore
it me againe. You may perceiue the scope of it:
but it is as vaine, as his Answers were. Thus with
my loue to you, I rest,
               
                  Your very louing friend,
WARVVICK.
               
            
         
         
            
               Master FISHER his Reflection
vpon the occasion and issue
of the Conference.
               NOW hauing made an end of this Relation, I
am to intreat the gentle Reader to reuiew it, or
reflect vpon it, and to call to minde, and mark,
first, the occasion, and consequently, the end of the Disputation;
secondly, the Question, and true meaning of it;
thirdly, what method was most fit to be obserued, intreating
of this Question; fourthly, what course was taken
by the Protestant Disputant, and what by the Catholique
Respondent. All which beeing duly considered, thou
wilt better see what is to bee iudged of the whole Conference
and wilt make to thy selfe more benefit of the matter
treated in it, then perhaps hitherto thou hast done
about the occasion.
               The occasion of the Disput
                     •
                  , was, &amp;c.
            
            
               
               Doctor FEATLY his Answer.
               THere is a threefold sight.
               First, per radium rectum, by a right beame
or line betweene the eye and obiect; as when I
looke directly vpon a mans face, and behold the
shape and proportion thereof as it is in it selfe.
               Secondly, per radium reflexum, by a reflected
line or beame; as, when I behold a mans face
and shape in a glasse.
               Thirdly, per radium refractum, by a broken
beame; as, when I behold the same mans face, or
any thing else through dispar medium, as water or
glasse. Whosoeuer viewes your Reflection, as you
call it, with a single eye, will iudge, that it ought
rather to haue been tearmed a Refraction; not for
that it proceeds from a man of a broken brain: (for
your intellectuals are good enough) but because
you defend a broken cause; and your proofes are
broken scraps taken out of Brerelies alsme-box: and
you represent no truth entirely, but brokenly. If it
represent any thing entirely, as by reflection, it
is the Fisher viewing himselfe vnhappily caught in
his owne net, struggling and striuing to breake out
of it, but all in vaine; 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  .
               As I haue before related your Relation: so I
will now reflect a while vpon your Reflection:
wherein I finde,
               First, matter of repetition touching the question,
and meaning of it, and the occasion of the

Conference and method vsed in it; whereunto I
haue answered before, and it is very tedious to
mee, to seethe againe your poore Cole-woort.
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                  
               
               Secondly, matter of additions, which are of
two sorts; either personall, and these concerning
               My selfe: for answer whereunto, I refer
you to the appendix;
               
               Master Salisburie, a diligent Preacher &amp;
smart Disputant, who either hath alreadie,
or will shortly meete with you at Fishers
folly.
               
               Or real, to wit, certain allegations crudely
taken out of Master Brerelyes Protestants Apologie,
falsely so called, tractatu 2. c. 2. sect.
11. subdiuis. 3. to proue, that by the confession
of Protestants, there were no Protestants
before Luther.
               
               Now, although I might iustly passe-ouer in
silence those testimonies, partly, because I haue
no particular quarrell with Master Brerely, but
with your selfe; partly, because none of those allegations
come neere the Outworkes, much lesse
the Castle of my defence: yet I hold it not altogether
vnfit to examine them particularly, that the
indifferent Reader may see with what sinceritie
you cite testimonies out of Protestant Writers.
Euripides long ago obserued, that things appeare
otherwise to those who view them afar off, them
to those that view them neere at hand:

               Master FISHER'S reflection, sect. 2. p. 50.

Epist. ad Argentin.
               
            
            
               Doctor FEATLY'S Answer.
               First, I answer, that Luthers words in his Epistle
ad Argent. in all the editions which I could
finde, are not so as Master Fisher cites them: that
which I finde in that Epistle any way looking
that way, is, Neque 
                        〈◊〉
                      possum me indignum
fuisse vas Dei, per quod 
                        〈…〉
                      saccursum
est: Neither can I deny▪ that I (though
vnworthy) haue been an instrument of God, by

which innumerable soules haue been helped. A
speech as modest as true, far different from that
which you quote in stead thereof.
               Secondly, if you can, in any Epistle ad Argentin.
or elsewhere in Luthers workes, find those
words, Wee dare boast, that Christ was first published
by vs; the meaning of them may bee gathered
from many other places of Luther, to bee this,
that in those parts of the Christian world, he was
the first that publiquely made head against the
Roman errors, and sent a Flag of defiance to the
Antichrist of Rome, and vindicated the truth of
Christs Gospel, so long with-held in vnrighteousnes.
               
                  Thirdly, Luther himselfe acknowledgeth, that
hee had many fore-runners: he giueth the hands
of fellowship to the Piccards, and Waldenses,
and (in a manner) canonizeth I. H

vnum, &amp;c. To the Christian Reader, Martin
Luther wisheth saluation in the Lord.
               
               The Prophet Elias the Thisbite, when the
Word of the Lord was precious, and vision
failed (all the Prophets (in a manner) being
slaine by the most wicked Iezabel) thought
that himselfe had been left alone; and therefore
being wearie of his life, wished, that God would
take it away from him, because being but one, he
deemed himselfe vnable to beare the intolerable
burden of a most wicked people &amp; their Princes;
not knowing, that God had reserued to himselfe
yet 7000. and that Abdias; with a hundred other
Prophets lurking in secret, were preserued

aliue. Which Storie, if I may compare small
things to great, seemeth to mee a perfect image
or emblem of this age wherein I liue: for, I by
diuine prouidence being drawne into the publique
theater of the world, so fought with these
monsters of Popish Indulgences and Decretals,
that I thought my selfe to bee alone, although
I neuer wanted courage in these combats; insomuch,
that I am rather accused of the contrarie,
of an ouerpoignant stile and fierie zeale:
yet I alwaies wished, that God would take mee
from among my Baalites, and that, being ciuilly
dead, I might enioy my selfe in some corner;
vtterly despairing of doing any good vpon the
brazen foreheads and iron necks of the wicked.
But behold, it is told mee also (as it was told
Elias) that God hath reserued vnto himselfe a
remainder (of true beleeuers) euen in this time,
&amp; that there are Prophets kept in secret: neither
is this said onely vnto me, but demonstrated vnto
me also, to my great comfort: for, Wesselus Frisius
Groningensis (whom they call Basil) is lately set
out in print, a man of a rare and great spirit, and
admirable wit, who (it appeares) was truely
taught of God, as those Christians were to bee,
of which Esay prophesieth. For, it cannot bee
thought, that hee receyued his learning from
men; as neither did I. If I had read this Author
before, my enemies might haue thought, that I
drew all out of Wesselus Store-house, his spirit &amp;
mine so perfectly agree.
               
                  
And as Luther agnized Wesselus for his noble
forerunner: so hee imbraced with truest affection
the Waldenses (tearmed, fratres Pigardi) as
appeares in his preface before the

                  Although these brethren dwelling in Bohemia
and Morauia, haue set forth the confession
of their faith &amp; doctrine in their owne bookes,
more dexterously and learnedly, then that
they need my commendation or preface: yet
in as much as for these many yeeres they haue
been branded with the odious name of Pigards,
Hereticks and Schismaticks, I thought fit to
afford them my best testimonie among our
owne, if yet it beare any weight at all.
               
               
                  When I was a Papist, I truely &amp; from my heart
hated these brethren tearmed Pigards, out of a
great zeale of God and Religion, and not out
of any desire of glory or gain
                        •
                      and when 
                        〈◊〉
                      vnawares
I lighted on some of the bookes of Iob
                           •
                        
Hus, and therein obserued the Scriptures so
powerfully and so purely handled, that I

began to maruell why the Pope and his Councell
should burne a man of such worth: presently
I shut the booke; suspecting, that vnder
hony there might lye hid some poyson,
where-with my simplicitie might haue been
infected. So strongly was I bewitched with the
name of a Pope and a Councell.
               
               
                  But after that, &amp;c. there began the ioy of
my heart: and viewing all those whom the
Pope had condemned, and put to death for
Heretiques, I esteemed them as Saints &amp; Martyrs;
especially those whose godly writings and
confessions I could finde, &amp;c.
               
               
                  Among these, I met with those brethren
whom they call Pigards, who were not now
so hatefull to mee, as they had been formerly
in the time of my Popery. To be briefe, I found
in these men a miracle, and that a very great
one, almost vnheard of in the Popish Church,
to wit, that these men, leauing the doctrines of
men, to the vtmost of their indeauour meditated
in the Law of God day and night, and were
very readie and skilfull in Scriptures; whereas
in the papacie, the greatest clarkes vtterly neglect
the Scriptures.
               
               
                  And I could not but congratulate both them
&amp; vs, that we who before were far seuered one
from another (esteeming each other as Heretiques)
now by the breaking downe of the
partition wall of suspition, became neere one to
the other, and were together brought into one
Sheepefold.
               
               
                  
Wherefore I commend to all the seruants of
God, this confession of the Brethren, whereby all
men may cleerely perceiue how wrongfully they
haue beene condemned and vexed by the Papists.
               Now how worthily Martin Luther conceyued
of Iohn Hus and Hierom of Prague, it appeares by
those his words in Asser. articul. 32. Iohannem Hus

Iohn Hus and Hierom, both Catholique men, they
being themselues Heretiques and Apostataes, and the
disciples of Antichrist. And in his first preface to
some of the Epistles of Hus, prefixed to the works
of Hus, In numero istorum operum sanctissimi Domini
papae habetur et hoc, quòd in Constantiensi Concilio optimum
et pijssimum virum Iohannem Hus damnauit:
In the number of those workes of the holy Father
the Pope, this is one, that in the Councell
of Constance, hee condemned Iohn Hus, a man of
singular worth and extraordinary piety: And
in the second preface, Has Epistolas sancti Martyris,
Iohannis Hus, &amp;c. These Epistles of the holy Martyr
Iohn Hus: And in his third Preface,

                   I haue heard from
men of credit, that the Emperour Maximilian
was wont to say of Iohn Hus: Alas! alas! they did
that good man wrong: and Erasmus Roterodam in
the first bookes which hee printed (lying yet by
me) writeth, that indeed Iohn Hus was burned, but
not conuicted. This was the iudgement of learned
men alwaies, concerning Iohn Hus, that great
wrong and violence was offered vnto him. For
proofe whereof, hee alleageth Doctor Sta
                        •
                     pritius,
and Andrew Praule; and in the end, addeth
moreouer, It is a thing confessed, euen by our
Aduersaries themselues (some of whom, beeing
great Diuines, I heard 30 yeeres agoe), that Iohn
Hus was excellently learned, and farre beyond
all the Doctors in that Councell. I my selfe,
when I was a young Student in Diuinity at Erford,
meeting with a booke of Sermons, penn'd
by Iohn Hus, was inflamed with a desire of reading

it thorow, that I might know what were
the heresies which this Arch-heretick broached.
This book was happily kept from burning, lying
hid among many other in the publique Library:
in the reading whereof, I was amazed, and could
not sufficiently admire what the cause might be,
that so great a Clarke, so expert and dexterous in
expounding and handling Scripture, should bee
burned.
               Thus you see, how farre Luther was from detracting
from any of his fore-runners: to whom
hee yeelded as ample a testimony for the Truth,
as they had yelded to the Truth. And I desire
the indifferent Reader to obserue, how Iohn Hus
his prophesie before his death, was fulfilled in
Luthers vindicating his doctrine and person.
Iohn Hus his words were, which are yet to bee
seene, stamped in antient coyne, currant among
the Hussites, Centum reuolutis annis, &amp;c. After a
hundred yeeres, you shall answer God and mee: and
some affirme, that hee added, Iam Hus, that is,
in the Bohemian Language, Goose: but there shall
follow mee a Swan, &amp;c. And indeed, after a hundred
yeeres, that Swan appeared in the world,
which most sweetly beganne to record the pure
notes of the Songs of Sion, whose strong quill
hath eternized Iohn Hus his innocencie of life,
and purity of Doctrine.

               Doctor FEATLY'S Answer.
               First, I would haue you to know, M. Fisher, that
I hold my self no way bound to giue an account
of euery rayling or ouer-lashing Lutherans
speech, no more then you will vndertake to
make good euery inuectiue of the secular Priests
against the Iesuites: such Writers of the pet

                  y
forme, of little antiquity, and lesse learning, were
not wont to be alledged in controuersies of moment

in Diuinity. But I perceiue by you, M.
Fisher, that (according to the Prouerb) all is fish
that commeth to your net. If these three had ioyntly
testified that for which you cite them, yet
their testimonies might soone bee blowne away,
by the conspiring breath of many Protestants of
better rank then they.Apologet. 
                  Regius, alledged by your
owne Brerely, testifyeth most expresly the contrary:
Dico fuisse ante Lutherum, verae Religionis et
qui cum Luthero per omnia consentires, coetum Ecclesiasticum
etsi à pontificijs non fuerit agnitus, nec propter
tyrannidem pontificium fortasse ostendi visibiliter potuerit.
I say, that before Luther there was a companie
professing the true Religion of the same beliefe
with Luther, although this company was
not agnized by the Papists, nor peraduenture
could visibly be shewne or poynted at, by reason
of the Popish tyrannie.

Our Church was then (viz. in the Ages before
Luther). But it was not visible, saith Bellarmine (to
weet, in the Popish sense). What then? Will it follow,
that therefore it was not at all in the world? By no
meanes; for it lay hid in the Desart. O

                  Alfonsus à Castro, and the Author of the Fasciculus
rerum exet: and many other, that the Waldenses
bore a Torch before Luther, and shewed
him his way. Yea but Schlusenburg saith, It is impudencie
to say, that many learned men in Germany
did hold the doctrine of the Lutheran Gospell. Schlusenburgs
words are, Impudenter scribit Vtenboyus
seex Conrado Pellicano audiuisse, multos viros eruditos
in Germaniâ, priusquam prodiret Lutherus, euangelij
doctrinam tenüisse; adeoque, ipsum Pellicanum,
priusquam auditum esset nomen Lutheri, Purgatorium
Papisticum reiecisse. Vtenboius writes impudently,
that he heard Conradus Pellicanus affirme, that many
learned men in Germany held the doctrine of
the Gospell, before Luther appeared; and that Pellicanus
himselfe impugned the Popish Purgatory,
before the name of Luther was heard. For
ought I know, Vtenboius is as honest a man, as Schlusenburgius:
and if Schlusenburgius deny it, Vtenboius
affirmeth it, yea, and (for ought is prooued to the
contrary) Conradus Pellicanus also: yet that which

                  Schlusenburg maintaineth for the honor of his
Master, no way helpeth your cause: for, admit
there were not in Germany, yet there might bee
elsewhere many thousands, as in Bohemia, France,
England, &amp;c. who, before Luther, embraced the
doctrine of the Gospell.
               Secondly, in Germany it selfe, there were not
multi eruditi viri, many learned men; yet there
might be some, for ought Schlusenburg saith to
the contrary: therefore Schlusenburges testimony
falls very short, neither doth George Myllius his
come much neerer to the marke. His words are, Si
antecessores Lutherus in officio habuisset Orthodoxos; Si
Apostasia commissa ab Episcopis Pontificijs non fuisset,
Lutherana reformatione opus non fuisset. Non ergo
possumus veros monstrare Episcopos, qui ante Lutherum
sub Papatu fuerint praedecessores Lutheri. Si enim
tales fuissent in Romana Ecclesia discedendi ab ista, causa
non fuisset. If Luther had had orthodoxall
Predecessors in his Office; If the Popish
Bishop had not made an Apostasie, there
should haue beene no need of a Lutheran
Reformation. Therefore, we cannot shew true
Bishops vnder the Papacie, to whom Luther succeeded:
for if there had beene such in the Romane
Church, there had beene no cause to depart
from it. What makes this testimony for you?
Is it for the honor of your Church, to bee truly
branded with Apostasie? to haue no orthodoxal
Bishops bearing rule in it? What though there
were no right-beleeuing Bishops vnder or in the

Papacy; will it follow, that there were no right-beleeuing
Christians elsewhere? It is true, Reformation
presupposeth a Deformation, as a remedy
presupposeth a disease; &amp; a purgation precedent
matter fit to bee purged. Though the
Romane Church, or rather the predominant
faction in the Romane Church, was vnsound in
the faith, and very corrupt and rotten; yet were
there other sound members of Christs Church,
in whose steps, it is well knowne, that Luther
trod. What a paralyticall Paralogisme is this?
Myllius a Lutheran affirmeth, that There were 
                        〈◊〉
                     
orthodoxall or right-beleeuing Bishops in the Romane
Sea, therfore there were no visible Protestants in
all the world before Luther. Now for Benedictus

                  Ioachimus Camerarius, but not
whither you would haue him. They both stand
for the honor of Luther, and maintaine, that he alone
laid the first stone in the Fabrick of reformation,
&amp; that none ought to share with him in that
dignity, in beeing the first Apostle of the reformed
Churches. They will not endure, that Luther
should be thought to draw water out of any
other Cisterne, but out of the Fountaine of liuing
water, the Scriptures. Wicklef indeed, saith
Ioachimus, was instructed by the Waldenses, and
Hus by Wicklef: but Luther receiued his doctrine
neither from Hus nor Wicklef, but was 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,
taught of himselfe out of Scriptures. This

preeminency all Protestants doe not willingly
grant to Luther. Zuinglius and Pellicanus, and
Vtenboius, and your owne Alfonsus à Castro, seeme
to make others as ready &amp; forward at that time,
as Luther. And indeed, whether Luther set
Zuinglius, or Zuinglius Luther first a-work, or whether
the Spirit of God stird vp both their spirits
at the same instant, to set to that noble work of
repairing and reforming Gods Temple, I hold it
needlesse to define. Let Luther and Zuinglius,
and many other their contemporaries and fellow-workmen
in that great work, shine as so many
precious stones in the foundation of the reformed
Churches: Ne sit primus, nec vel imus
quispiam. Will it follow, that because Luther
was 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and did not tind his candle at
another mans light, therefore there was no
visible Protestant at that time, but hee? It will
follow, say you, because Morgenst addeth, that. It
is manifest to the whole world, that before Luther's
time, all Churches were ouerwhelmed with more then
Cymerian darknesse. And you adde also to Morgenst,
fiue other corroboratory testimonies, of
Caluin, Bucer, Beza, Iewell and Perkins: whereunto
after I haue giuen a direct and particular answer,
I will dismisse you.
            
            
               
               Master FISHER.
               And lest this may bee thought to haue beene onely
the conceit of Luther and Lutherans (who yet could
better tell, then D. Featly, D. White, and such other
new Masters) I will adde heereunto what is said,
first, by
                     Caluin in l. Epist. ep. 141. 
                  Caluin, who doth acknowledge, that in this
Lutheran reformation, there was made a discession or
departure from all the world. Secondly, by
                     Bucer Ep. ad Epis. Hereford. 
                  Bucer,
who calleth Luther the first Apostle of the reformed
doctrine. Thirdly, by Beza
                  
                     Beza in Theol. Ep. Epist. 5. a principall Caluinist,
who teacheth, that at this time, ordinary vocation of the
Church-men was no where extant; and consequently
teacheth, that there was at that time no visible Church,
and so if any Church at all, it was onely inuisible, as is
affirmed euen by our owne English Protestant Diuines,
namely
                     Iewel, in his Apologie of the Church, cap. 4. diuis. 2. and in his defence 40. Master Iewel, who saith, The truth was
vnknowne and vnheard of, when Martin Luther
and Viderick Zuinglius first came to the knowledge
and preaching of the Gospell; and M. Perkins,
                  
                     Perkins in his Expos. of the Creed,
who saith, Wee say, that before the daies of Luther,
for the space of many hundred yeeres, an vniuersall
Apostasie ouer-spred the whole face of the earth, and
that our (Protestant) Church was not visible to the
world.
            
            
               
               Doctor FEATLY.
               When Caluin saith, There was a departure made
from all the world; and Morgenst, That all Churches
were ouerwhelmed with more then Cymerian darknes;
and Perkins, that An vniuersall Apostasie ouerspred
the whole face of the earth; and Iewell; that Luther &amp;
Zuinglius were most excellent men sent from God, to
giue light to the whole world: their meaning is not,
that there was no light in those times in Goshen, or
that there were no Abdiases, with many other
Prophets lying in secret; or that there were not
many thousands that neuer bowed the knee to
the Romish Baal: for they all affirme the contrary
in sundry places of their writings. But they take
the word World, as it is vsually taken both in sacred
&amp; prophane Writers, for the greater part of
the world, or at least, that part that beareth the
greatest sway, and is in a manner onely in voage.
Their words sound according to the Tenor of
those in S. Iohn; The whole world is set on wickednesse;
and the like in S. Ierome, Totus mundus ingemuit se
factum Arrianum; the whole world sighed, that it
became Arrian. As Luther, so Caluin also acknowledgeth,
that Christ hath alwaies had his floore
on earth, sometimes more, sometimes lesse purged:
And further, they deny not, but that before
the publick and generall purging of the
floore of the visible Church, from the chaffe of
Romish superstitions in our daies, there were

many that in sundry corners of the earth, seuered
diuers heaps of wheat from the chaffe, and clensed
it from darnell &amp; tares. Among whom, were
Fratres Pigardi, a remainder of the Waldenses;
betweene whom, and Caluin, many kinde offices
passed, as their mutuall Letters testifie, extant in
Caluins works.Inter Epist. Calu. Ep. 250. Quomam, vir venerande, ante annos circiter triginta, inter humanit atem tuam, tum Argentina agentem, &amp; fratres qui falso Pigardi vel Waldenses dicuntur, charis

                        •
                     itna &amp; familiaritas, &amp;c. Thus one of the Preachers of the
Waldenses writes to Caluin:
               
               Reuerend in the Lord: because aboue 30 yeeres agoe,
when you remained at Argentine, there was an holy
league of loue and entire friendship and familiarity betweene
you and the brethren, who are falsely termed
Pigards or Waldenses, our dearest Fathers in the Lord;
Wee, who now hold the place of those our Fathers, (whom
God hath called, almost all of them, out of this mortall
life) thought fit to renew that knowledge, or rather
band of Christian loue, wherewith all the seruants of
God, especially the Ministers of the Gospell, ought to be
most strictly and firmely knit together.
               
                  To the former letter, Caluin returnes this courteous
answer,
                  Gratias agimus non vulgares, quòd Fratres qui vestrierga nos amoris fraternaque coniuncti

                     sum esse, &amp;c. Epist. 251. Wee render you more then
ordinary thankes, for sending the brethren vnto vs, who
may remaine as witnesses and pledges of your loue towards
vs, and brotherly coniunction; which kind office
of yours, wee the more willingly embrace, because it
flowed from a sincere loue of true Religion. Wee desire
that you will be likewise perswaded of the like affection
in vs towards you, and the great desire we haue to cherish
this holy vnity among vs. For, being so farre remooued
one from another, and compassed round about with
enemies, who take vp the greater part of the world, it

is a great delight vnto vs to enioy yet this comfort of our
dispersion, &amp;c.
               
                  Againe, the same Caluin in his Epistles, Epist.
179. to Stanist. Carninsk, thus writeth of the
Waldenses:
                  De vestro cum Waldensibus consensu optima quaeque spero, non modò quia sanctam vnitatem, in quam coalescunt Christi membra, Deus semper benedicere solitus est, sed quòd inter haec rudimenta, fratrum Waldensium peritiam, quam longo vsu Dominus exercuit, non vulgari adiumento vobis fore spero. Quare vobis omnibus danda est opera, vt haec pia conspiratio magis ac magis sanciatur, &amp;c. I hope the best of your agreement with
the Waldenses; not onely, because God alwaies vseth to
blesse the holy vnity, in which the members of Christ
grow vp together, but also, because in these your rudiments
and beginnings, I conceiue, that the skill and long
experience of the Waldenses, will bee an extraordinary
help vnto you: wherefore all of you must doe the vttermost
of your endeuours, that this holy agreement &amp; consent
betweene you, may more and more be established,
&amp;c.
               
                  Martin Bucer (whom you alleage in the
next place) held the like correspondence
with the Waldenses, as may be gathered from
that Letter of his which hee wrote vnto
them.
               Blessed be the Lord God our louing Father, who hath
preserued you to this present time, in so great knowledge
of his truth, and who hath now inspired you in the search
thereof, hauing made you capable and fit to doe it. Behold
now, what the nature of true faith is, which is, that
so soone as it knowes in part any spark of the diuine light,
it preserueth carefully the things that are giuen vnto it
of God. Saint Paul is an example to vs, who in all his
epistles, shewes the great care that he hath had to procure
the glory of God. And doubtlesse, if wee pray with a
good heart, that the name of God be sanctified, and his
Kingdome may come, we shall prosecute nothing with

such diligence, as the establishment of the truth where it
is not, and the aduancement thereof where it is already
planted. One onely thing doth especially grieue mee, that
our imployments at this time are such, about other
affaires, that wee haue no leasure to answer you at large,
as we desire, &amp;c.
               By the contents of this Letter, and many other
passages in Bucers Works, which for breuities
sake I omit, it appeares that Bucer, in calling
Luther the first Apostle of the reformed Doctrine,
did not thereby intend, that Luther was the
first that euer preached the Doctrine of the reformed
Churches; for, hee could not bee ignorant,
that after Christ and his Apostles, and
the Fathers for 6 or 700 yeers, Bertram, &amp; Elfrick,
&amp; Berengarius, and Petrus Brus, and Henry of Tolous,
and Dulcinus, and Arnoldus, and Lollardus, and
Wicklef, and Hus, and Ierome of Prague, and many
other Starres, fought in their courses against the
Romish Sisera. But Bucers meaning is, that Luther
was the first, who in our Age and memory, publikely
and success-fully set on foot a generall Reformation
of the Church in these Westerne
parts: when the corrupt matter of Popish errors
and superstitions long in gathering, grew now
to a ripe coare, Luther was the first who openly
lanced it. Luther formed no new Church, but
reformed the Church hee found; and therefore
cannot bee termed, The first Apostle of Protestant
Doctrine; although, in a tolerable sense,
hee may be stiled, The first Apostle of the happie

Reformation in our daies. Luther burnisht and
refined the gold of the Sanctuary, obscured
with rust: he made not new gold.
               In your allegation out of Beza, by suppressing
the Aduerb (penè, almost), you shew your selfe,
non penè, not almost, sed penitùs, altogether a falsificator.
Beza's words, Epist. 5. are, Huic tum demum
locum esse dicimus, cùm vel nulla, vel penè nulla est ordinaria
vocatio, sicut nostris temporibus accidit in Papatu.
We say, that then extraordinary calling takes
place, when there is either no, or almost no ordinary
vocation (of Pastors), as in our time fell out
in the Papacie. This (almost) you omit altogether.
For Beza's opinion, touching extraordinary
calling, as I doe not heere oppugne, so much
lesse doe I vndertake to maintaine. We can, and
haue prooued lawfull &amp; ordinary calling in our
Church of England, as you may see in M. Masons
most accomplished Treatise of this Subject, lately
reuised by him before his death, and translated
into Latine, at this instant sweating vnder the
Presse. Admit, there had beene no ordinary calling
of right-beleeuing Church-men, Bishops,
or Priests, when Luther did first sound his siluer
Trumpet: what will you inferre thereupon?
that at that time there was no visible Church?
There Beza leaues you, who professeth both a
visible Church in generall, consisting of members,
sound and vnsound, and these more or lesse;
and in particular,In his booke of worthy men. hee calleth the Waldenses, The
seed of the most pure, antient, Christian Church, which

was miraculously preserued in the midst of the darknes
and errors, which haue beene hatched by Satan in these
latter times. And as Beza leaues you, in this
your inference, so also doth the Truth:
For, although the Ship of Christ is in great
danger, when erronious Pastors, like false lights,
are set vp in the Watch-Towers of Sion, yet, sith
our chiefe Pilot hath forewarned vs heereof, and
bid vs take heede of false prophets and teachers,
and hath left vs a most certaine direction in his
Word, which is the true Light, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
conduct vs to those pulchri portus, the faire Hauens
in Heauen; the people of God may keepe
the right way, and through Gods grace escape
the quick-sands of heresie. As God bestoweth
diuers gifts of the Spirit ordinarily vpon the
Clergie, so he bestoweth also where he pleaseth,
Spiritum discretionis, in the Laytie, a Spirit whereby
they may discerne spirits, whether they are of
God or no; a Spirit, by which, trying all things,
they may hold fast that is good. And if their ghostly
Fathers offer them a stone for bread,
                  Mat. 7. 9, 10. or a Serpent
for fish, they will cast it away: Or if more cunningly
they shall mingle error and heresie with
truth, and offer them, as your Teachers did and
doe, an apple with a worme in it, or a cup of
wine with a dead Fly, they will take out the
worm and Fly, and then eat of the one, and drink
of the other. This is that which
                     Baltasar Praefat. in Waldens. 
                  Lydius truly
obserueth, Oft-times the eares of the Auditors are
purer then the tongue of the Preacher. Hee deliuers

vngarbled spices, they garble it; vnsifted meale,
they sift and boult it; impure milke, they straine
it. In the daies of Ieremy, and much more after
the death of the Prophet Malachy, vntill the birth
of Christ, there were few(I would see a Catalogue of true Teachers of the infallible faith in those times.) Doctors in Israel,
that rightly expounded the Law, and taught
Gods people as they ought: yet no man doubts
that God had then a visible Church; as also afterwards
in the time of the Arrian &amp; Eutychian
persecution, in which there were very few Bishops
or Pastors vntainted with those heresies:
Therefore, although we should grant you your
antecedent out of Beza, that there was no ordinary
vocation at that time, of pure and sincere
Teachers, yet wee will barre you of your conclusion,
that at that time there was no visible
Church. Our English Diuines, alledged by
you, affirme no such thing. Perkins saith not,
that our Church was simply inuisible, but that
it was not visible to the world; adding in the
same place, that it lay hid vnder the chaffe of Popery.
And the truth of this, saith hee, the Records of
all Ages manifest. The same Perkins, in his Reformed
Catholick, more fully explaineth his
meaning, thus: Though Popery raigned and ouerspred
the face of the earth, for many hundred yeeres: yet in
the middest thereof, God reserued a people to himselfe,
that truly worshipped him; The woman fled into the wildernesse,
&amp;c. And she still retaines a remnant of her
seed, which keepe the commandement of God, and haue
the testimony of Iesus Christ. See here how farre

hee is from denying a Protestant Church extant
                     •
                  
that he affirmeth it to haue growne vp and thriued,
euen in the Thicket of Popery, though much
ouer-shadowed and ouer-topped. Neither can
you finde any flaw or cloud in that orient Ge

it fittest to refell these and the like slanders by

of Christs true Church, I (in all humility)
submit to the iudgement of the true visible
Church. I hope, the Truth shall suffer nothing,
because of mee: and if I suffer any thing, by loose
tongues or pens, because of the Truth, I will

Lord Iesus Christ: To whose sauing grace, and
boundlesse mercy, I commend all those who
loue Truth in sincerity.
