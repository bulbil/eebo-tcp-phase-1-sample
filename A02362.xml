            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

                     ALthough that man be the moſt perfect &amp; abſolute of all other cretures, neuertheleſſe, ſo weake is he by Nature, &amp; ſo ſubiect to infinite infirmities, that Diuine Hippocrates hath urged him, to be euen ſicknes it ſelfe from his very birth: He is not fit (ſaith he) to bee imployed in any buſineſſe while be ſucketh: becauſe h

                        •
                     ſter to giue him inſtruction: Againe, when he is growne to the prime of his age, hee becomes audacious and proud. At last in his declining time, he falls into miſery, hauing nothing left him, but the remembrance of his labours ill beſtowed.
                  
                     Pliny noteth, and experience ſhews it to be true that the ill ſent only of a Candle new put foorth, is enough to deſtroy a child in the mothers wombe, ſo that ſhee may be forced to fall in trauaile, and be deliuered before her time, vnleſſe her ſtrength be the greater to reſiſt the

offence. And although the child ſtay the full time that nature hath prefixed him: yet commonly he is not able to get foorth, or come ſafely into the Worlde (yea though the birth be naturall) without the helpe not onely of the Mother, and himſelfe: but alſo of the Mid-wife and other women about her ready to receiue and cheriſh him: And which is worſt of all; if he be placed awry, or elſe be weake and faint, or elſe if the midwife be at the fartheſt of her skill; then if they will ſaue the child, and ſo conſequently the mother from death: they muſt call a Chirurgion to deliuer her, and bring the child into the world: which (that I may touch it by the way without taxing any) is commonly done too late eyther through the wilfulneſſe of the kinſfolks, or obſtinacy of the Midwiues.
                  But grant that the childe comes into the world of it ſelfe, without the helpe either of Chirurgion or Midwife: yet (as it is commonly ſaid) he drawes his death after him: the which may be plainely perceiued by the cryes and laments which he maketh as ſoone as he ſeeth the light, as if hce craued for helpe and ſuccour. For if he ſhould continue in that caſe that hee comes from his mothers wombe, clogged with his bed or after-birth, without doubt this bedde being putrified, would infect the child, and at length kill it. Beſides, oftentimes if there were not helpe to make a free paſſage, in the fundament, yard, or other naturall places, that are ſometimes cloſed vp, there could neither ſuſtenance be receiued, nor excrements expelled, which would cauſe the child to be ſtifled, and choked vp.
                  Many times alſo the head, and other parts of the bodie,

(as the bones and legges) happen to be ill ſhapen, yea broken and out of ioint, which would neuer come of themſelues, into their proper and naturall place. There, then is it neceſſary that the Chirurgion vſe his helpfull and skilfull hand: So that euery man may plainly ſee the neceſsity and Antiquity of this worke: ſince that the firſt practiſe in Chirurgery, that euer was done in the world, was the Omphalotomia, or cutting of the Nauell, which Adam and Eue practiſed on their firſt child.
                  Theſe therefore are the Motiues that haue induced me to publiſh this diſcourſe, and therin to treat of ſuch diſeaſes as happen to women with child.
                  And heerein I haue endeuoured to helpe them both in their naturall, and extraordinary trauaile: and to eaſe them in all ſuch accidents, as may happen vnto them in their childbed: being the rather incited thereunto, by reading the complaints of Women, related by Soranus. O malè occupatum virorum genus! occidimur nos non morimur: &amp; ab illis qui inter vos peritiſſimi exiſtimantur perperam curatae. Vos de qualibet leuiſſimâ veſtratum affectionum, libros ex libris facientes, bibliothecas Voluminibus oneratis; de noſtriſ intereà diris et difficillimis cruciatibus nullâ vel exiguâ mentione facta.
                  
                  O men, how ill doe you beſtow your time, and paines! Alas, wee women die not, but are tormented euen to death: For thoſe that are accounted the moſt expert and skilfull among you, take not that care of vs which they ſhould: you fill whole Libraries with large volumes &amp; writings of euerie light and triuiall diſeaſe of your

owne making little or no mention at all, of our cruell and inſupportable torments.
                  I had purpoſed aboue fifteene yeares ſince, to haue written ſomwhat concerning this ſubiect in my books of Chirurgery: but hauing more maturely conſidered thereof, I thought it fitter to write a Treatiſe of it by it ſelfe: which it deſerueth both for the difficultie of the ſubiect, and for the variety of the matter which I was deſirous to obſerue therein: And indeede this worke excelleth all other, which are practiſed vppon the body of man: whether ye reſpect the Antiquity, Neceſsi
                        •
                     y, or dexterity thereof.
                  For the Antiquitie: without doubt the firſt worke in Chirurgery, that euer was in the worlde, was the cutting of the Nauell which, (as is ſaide before) Adam practiſed vppon his firſt borne.
                  Concerning the neceſsity: ſome perhaps may obiect, that the bringing a bed of women, is not ſo neceſſary a worke as theſe following:
                  To ſtay the fluxe of bloud, whether it bee in veine or Arterie; to vſe the Trepan; to open the Empyema, or ſuppuration in the breaſt; to cut one that hath the Dropſie; or to let bloud skilfullie: For the fluxe of bloud it may bee further ſaide, that vnleſſe it bee ſtopped by leeſing the bloud, the life alſo is endangered. But we muſt conſider, that the bloud oftentimes ſtaying of it ſelfe, and experience euidently ſhews, that nature, which is wiſe and prouident doth commonly reſtraine, and ſtop it. I haue beene preſent in many skirmiſhes, (yet farre enough out of gunſhot, where I haue dreſſed many that were wounded,

who haue had the great veſſels in many parts of their bodies cut, and bruiſed, hauing loſt much bloud vppon the hurt, and yet it hath ſtopped and ſtayed of it ſelfe. Some wil ſay, that he who hath his ſcull cl
                        •
                     ft by a wound is in danger of death, if the bloud that is ſhed vpon the Membrane, be not taken foorth by the meanes of the Trepan; For this bloud would be wholly putrified, and withall, corrupt the braine, the chiefe inſtrument of life, and whoſe vſe is more then neceſſary. Notwithſtanding wee ſee, that in many, the filth and ma
                        •
                     ter comes foorth by the Noſe, Eares, and mouth, without being trepanned, yea, that it paſſeth euen through their bones. Wee may ſay the like of ſuch which haue the Dropſie, or Empyema, the breaſt of the one is full of Corruption, &amp; the others belly full of water: they both choake and ſtifle, vnleſſe the Chirurgion make inciſion: in the one making a Paracentoſis, in the other opening the Pleura.
                  Yet neuertheleſſe we ſee, that he which hath an Empyema or ſuppuration doth oftentimes expell the matter, and filth, by the mouth or vrine (the waies beeing manifeſt, by which nature doth vnburthen her ſelfe) and he that hath the Dropſie auoideth the water, eyther by vrine, or ſtoole, yea, and by ſweat, or by ſome little vent which Nature makes in ſome part of the body, as in the Nauell or legges: which we obſerue by daily experience in many men: and therefore wee may perceiue, that theſe practiſes are not alwaies, ſo neceſſary, and requiſite.
                  For letting bloud; you will ſay, that hee hazards his life, (and that ſodainely) who beeing oppreſſed, and

troubled with a great paine of his head or ſide, is not ſpeedily let bloud? becauſe the bloud that boyleth in his veines, striueth onely to come foorth; I will anſwere: that Nature very often ſends it foorth by the Noſe, Mouth, Eies, and Eares: by ſtoole alſo, and other parts, disburthening her ſelfe to the ſicke Mans eaſe and profit: But It is not ſo in the deliuery of women; for if the entrance of the wombe be cloſed, (as it is ſeene in diuers) whether it be naturally, by reaſon of a ſtrong and thicke membrane, which ſhutteth vp the paſſage: or other wiſe, becauſe ſome ſcarre happening there, hath hardned, and ſhrunke vp the ſides of the necke of the ſaid wombe: it would be impoſsible that nature ſhould euer be able to ſeparate, and breake through th
                        •
                     ſe impediments: for as for the one, it is hard for a penne or quill to paſſe there, and for the other, you cannot put in a ſmall probe through the little hole which is in the middeſt of the membrane. And yet I haue had the experience thereof in two women, which were neuer the leſſe with child, as I will ſhew more at large heereafter. So that either the Chirurgions helpe muſt bee vſed, or elſe both the Mother and the child would die miſerablie.
                  Some may obiect vnto mee, that the Mother might open the paſſage her ſelfe by tearing the parts ſo bound by the ſcarre, &amp; breaking through the ſaid membrane? But what will you anſwere me, for her which hath her child turned awry and lies double in her wombe, and falleth into a Convulſion, or fluxe of bloud, or both together. The Mother not being able eyther to turne it, or pull it foorth, eſpecially if the head of it bee intangled

and faſtned betweene the bones of os Pubis, ſo that it is impoſsible to turne it, ſafe and ſound, except the Chirurgion vſe his induſtry and skill.
                  Now for the dexteritie: there is no compariſon betweene this and other practiſes; for there be no workes to be done in Chirurgery; where it is not neceſſary, to haue the benefit either of daylight or candle light, and the part which is to be handled, and dreſſed muſt be apparent and laid open to the eye.
                  Whereas contrariwiſe in this worke as well by reaſon of the company preſent, as alſo, least the woman ſhould be afraid, the very entrance, whereby hee ſhould put in his hand, they are conſtrained to hide: and then his hand being there, he muſt ſearch for the child) howſoeuer it be placed) not being able to ſee it. And if there be found two, three, or foure Children, yea, ſometime fiue (as Albertus Magnus reporteth, hee ſaw in Germanie, a Woman that brought foorth to the number of threeſcore and fiue children, beeing deliuered euerie yeare of fiue) then (I ſay) I leaue you to iudge what skill and dexteritie the Chirurgion ought to vſe in ſeeking them one after another if they come amiſſe.
                  On the other ſide, as often as a woman is well deliuered by the helpe and hand of the Chirurgion, there life is giuen to two, to wit: to the Mother and the childe. And therfore as this worthy man ſaith, In partu inuocatur dei auxilium: quaeritur enim &amp; parturientis &amp; naſcentis ſalus. When a woman is in trauaile, they call vppon God for helpe: becauſe they deſire to ſaue both the Mother and the child. Now in all other practiſes, though they attaine to their wiſhed end, yet can

there bee but one onely ſaued at once. Whereby it may be iudged, that this practiſe is both for the Antiquitie, Neceſsitie, and dexterity thereof, the moſt laudable and commendable of all others.
                  To make the which more eaſie, and the better to inſtruct the young Chirurgion: I haue gathered together all that I could poſsibly, out of that which I haue obſerued this forty yeares and aboue, wherein I haue practiſed it, and ſeene it practiſed, in the greateſt families both within, and without this Kingdom, where, thanks be to God, good vſe hath beene made of me. And withall I haue not refuſed nor diſdained to go vnto the meanest, mooued partly by Charity, and partly to make my ſelfe more and more experienced therein.
                  Hauing then conferred together, what eyther the Graecians and Latines both ancient and Moderne haue written, with that I haue beene able to obſerue: and hauing reduced it all into one, I haue put it into French in fauour of thoſe who are not ſo well learned, and haue not the knowledge of the Greeke or Latine tongues.
                  Some will ſay (to diminiſh that little honor, which I might get by this my labour) that the Ancients haue written the greateſt part heereof. But they ſhall learne from the mouth of this great Oracle, That there is no leſſe witte and vnderſtanding required, to bee able to iudge of Sciences formerly written, then to bee the firſt Authors of them.
                  
                  I know Moreouer, that in the Doctrine, and much more in the phraſe, ſome will find many things to be reprehended. But I intreat the Reader, that he would receiue it in as good part as I offer it him: and likewiſe

exhort others, (that are more experienced, then I am: to doe better. Let them ſhew me my faults friendly; and I will not refuſe, willingly to retract them: after the example of that diuine Hipocrates, who freely confeſſed his, ſaying openly, that he had gotten more diſhonor, then either glory, or credit, by practiſing of Phiſicke.
                  
                  
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  The Tranſlators Preface.
                  
                     THus far hath the Authour pleaded for him ſelfe, whom while I Tranſlate, leaſt the fault be tranſlated vpon me, I will ſpeake ſomewhat for my ſelfe, before I be accuſed: leaſt when I am accuſed, there be no bodie to ſpeake for me: If therefore it be thought preiudiciall, either to the literarie common-wealth of Phyſicke, that I haue exported and made common a commoditie, which the learned would haue had priuate to themſelues: or if I haue been oftenſiue to Women, in proſtituting and divulging that, which they would not haue come to open light, and which beſide cannot be expreſt in ſuch modeſt termes, as are fit for the virginitie of pen &amp; paper, and the white ſheetes of their Child-bed. I muſt (as well as I can) defend my ſelfe from theſe imputations, and ſhew my care to keep both learning and modeſtie illibate, and inuiolable. Firſt then, I haue done no more in this, then the Author hath in his French Copie, which is

common to be had and read in that vulgar tongue: In defence of which, and this the ſhadow therof, I muſt ſay that it is not writ ſo much for the learned (who notwithſtanding, if they haue not the french, may make vſe of this) as for the Chirurgions, &amp; Midwiues, who are called to this kinde of employment. As for women (whom I am moſt afraid to offend) they muſt be content to haue their infirmities detected, if they will haue helpe for them, which I wiſh might not come to any eare or eye, but to thoſe which they themſelues would haue acquainted therewith, and as well for their ſakes, as mine owne ſatisfaction: I haue endeuoured to be as priuate and retired, in expreſsing al the paſſages in this kind as poſsibly I could.
                  And with this I hope all good Gentlewomen will reſt ſatisfied: to whom I wiſh all happineſſe of increaſe, and all increaſe of happineſſe, that they may haue a good houre for this buſineſſe, and for all other Contentments, many good daies and yeares.

                     THE PREFACE.
                     
                        I Haue purpoſed only in this Worke, to handle the gouernment of a Woman with childe, and the meanes to helpe her in her trauaile; together with the order which is neceſſarie for her in her childebed. But becauſe this gouernment is particular, and proper to a Woman with childe, before we giue order thereunto, wee must firſt finde out whether ſhee be with childe, or no.
                  
                  
                     
                     The ſignes to know whether a woman be with childe, or no. CHAP. I.
                     
                     
                        A Chirurgion muſt bee very circumſpect, in determining whether a woman be conceiued, or no; becauſe many haue preiudiced their knowledge, and diſcretion, by iudging raſhly hereof. For there is nothing more ridiculous, then to aſſure a woman that ſhee is with childe; and afterward, that her naturall ſickneſſe,The Chirurgions muſt beware of iudging raſhlie. or ſtore of water ſhould come from her: and in ſtead of a childe, ſome windie matter ſhould breake from her, and ſo her belly fall, and grow flat againe: which hath hapned vnto many men, that haue beene well eſteemed, both for their learning, and experience. And wee haue ſeene the experience hereof in ſome women, which were (without all queſtion) thought to be ſo great, that the Midwife was euen ready to receiue the child:A ſtory. who notwithſtanding haue beene freed and acquitted heereof either by their naturall purgings and euacuations, or by voiding of water, or elſe expelling of winde. The which hapned vnto Mad. P. to her great griefe, who was deliuered of certaine gallons of water, when ſhe thought aſſuredly that ſhe had beene with childe. I ſaw the contrary happen to the daughter of M. Marcel: who was iudged

by foure of the chiefe Phyſitians, and as many Chirurgions, and two Midwiues, not to haue beene with childe; and yet being dead, there was found in her body, a child betweene ſix and ſeuen months old. And of late memorie, ſome of the moſt expert Phyſitians, and Chirurgions of our time,Another. vndertooke the cure of an honeſt woman; and from the third vntill the eighth moneth of her time, adminiſtred vnto her infinite many Cliſters, Apozemes, Potions, Fomentations, and Iniections, and yet could not they prouoke her naturall ſickneſſe, much leſſe cauſe her to be deliuered. At length in the ninth moneth, ſhe thinking that ſhe had had the Chollicke, was brought a bed of a faire daughter, being verily perſwaded euen then when ſhe was in trauaile that ſhe was not with child, as ſhe had aſſured vs, all the time that ſhe went. Directions for the Chirurgion.So that a Chirurgion being called to giue his opinion of the conception of a woman, whether it be in a iudiciall, or priuate caſe, muſt be very warie and circumſpect what iudgement he giues herein.
                     The ancient and moderne writers haue left ſome ſignes whereby we may foretell it, which are collected from the Husband, from the Wife, from the Child, and from the Midwife.
                     As for thoſe ſignes which are taken from the Man, they are theſe:Signes of cō
                           ception taken from the man If he finde an extraordinarie contentment in the companie of his Wife; and if he feele at the ſame time a kind of ſucking or drawing at the end of his yard; if he returne from the field of nature, not ouer-moyſt, theſe are ſignes that

a woman may haue conceiued.Experiment. And by theſe obſeruations I haue knowne men which haue aſſured their Wiues that they haue got them with child, as ſoone as they haue had their company.
                     
                        Signes taken from the woman.The ſignes which are taken from the Woman are more manifeſt and certaine: and although the greateſt part of them bee found in Women and Maids, which cannot haue their naturall courſes: yet neuertheleſſe all theſe ſignes ioyned together, a man may preſume as farre of them as arte wil permit, and they be theſe: If ſhe receiued an extraordinarie delight in the companie of her Husband: if from her naturall parts (whether they continue dry or moiſt) there iſſue or flow nothing forth, becauſe it is no neceſſarie conſequence, that thoſe parts ſhould alwaies remaine dry, ſince the Matrice retaineth onely that, which is fit for the conformation of the child. Likewiſe, if at the ſame time ſhe hath a kind of yawning, and ſtretching, and feeles within her a ſhaking or quiuering (ſuch as we commonly find preſently vpon making of water) which runneth through the whole body, with a kind of chilneſſe, and is felt chiefely betweene the ſhoulders and the backe, with ſome paine about the Nauell, and a rumbling or diſquietneſſe in the neather belly, which hapneth, becauſe the Matrice ſhrinks it ſelfe together,The wombe ſhuts it ſelfe to entertaine and embrace the matter of generation which it hath drawne and ſuckt in, feeling thereby a kind of tickling. Againe, if within few dayes ſhe falles a vomiting, and ſpitting, diſtaſts her meate, groweth dull, careleſſe, and

qualmiſh, longeth after ſtrange things, finding her belly fallen, and growne flat, according to the French prouerbe.

                           
                              —Au ventre plat, enfant ya.
                           
                           In a belly which is flat,
                           Ther's a child, be ſure of that.
                        
Which makes them oftentimes to complaine and ſay they be quite fallen away. Then not long after her belly ſwells and growes bigger; her hips and raines are inlarged; her courſes appeare not, which ſhould flow at certain times,Some women when they be with child haue their courſes. (although ſome haue them whē they be with child.) Likewiſe if towards the ſecond month her eyes grow hollow &amp; wan, her eye-balls ſhew leſſe: the lids be looſe, limber, and ſoft: the veines in the corners of her eyes more ſwollen, and bigger then ordinarie.
                           Hippocrates.
                         For as H
                              •
                           ppocrates ſaith, if thou canſt not finde by any meanes whether a woman be with child, or no, her very eyes wil tell thee: for their eyes be more hollow, and ſunke inward; and the white is turned bluiſh: the veines and arteryes of their neck are puſt vp, and more apparent then vſually: their breſts grow big, and hard, with ſome paine and pricking, hauing alſo milke within them: the nipple waxeth firme, and hard: red, if it be a boy; and ſometime blackiſh, if it be a wench, which hapneth about the third or fourth moneth, when they begin to quicken.
                     
                        Signes taken from vrines.Some iudge of their being with child by the vrine, as if it be white, and clearely mingled with little moates, and that at the top there is perceiued

as it were a little cloud like to the Rainebow; or of an Opall colour, At the bottome there appeares a certaine thicke ſediment, which beeing ſhaken, ſpreads it ſelfe into little flocks, like to carded wooll. Towards the end, their vrine is thicke and reddiſh, by reaſon of the long retention of their naturall courſes.
                     
                        Experiment of Fernelius.
                        
                        Fernelius makes this triall, which is, to take equall quantities of the womans vrine, and of white wine and to ſhake them well together, if this mixture looke like the broth of Beanes, it is a ſigne ſhe is with child.
                     
                        
                           Hippocrates. Hydromell is made of hony and water boiled together.
                        Hippocrates ſets downe diuers experiments, as to giue the woman Hydromell to drinke made with raine water at night when ſhe goes to bed, or elſe Hony and Anniſſeed beaten and diſſolued in water. If ſhe be with child, ſhe will feele great paines and griping in her belly, (vnleſſe ſhe be vſed to ſuch kind of drinke,
                           Auicen.
                         as Auicen ſaith.) Beſides, if ſhe receiue below any ſtrong or ſtinking oder or ſmell, her clothes being well wrapped cloſe about her, and the ſent pierce not vp into her noſe, ſhe hath conceiued: As alſo, hauing ouer night put vp a cloue of Garlicke, if in the morning the ſauour or taſte come not into her mouth.
                     
                        Trueſt ſignes gathered from the Child.But theſe ſignes are not ſo certaine, the trueſt and ſureſt are thoſe which are collected from the child, when he begins to ſtirre and mooue, which commonly happens in the third and fourth moneth. This motion is very gentle, not vnlike the ſtirring of a flie when he flieth.
                     
                        Another certaine ſigne may be perceiued by the Midwife,Signes gathered by the Midwife. who putting vp her finger into the wombe to touch the inner orifice thereof, if the woman be with child ſhe ſhall finde it ſo cloſe ſhut, that the point of a needle will ſcarſe enter therein, yet ſoft, and without any hardneſſe, which alſo will bee drawn vpward being ſhrunke and as it were truſſed vp, becauſe the body of the Matrice doth gather it ſelfe together to embrace the ſeed, which is the reaſon that the Midwife can very hardly come to reach it with her finger.
                     Some women when they be with child hate the companie of their husbands: which quality is ſaid alſo to be in brute beaſts when they be great with yong, who commonly ſhun the company of the Male. And ſurely there be certaine times and ſeaſons of the yeare proper for brute beaſts to couple, but man (as Pliny ſaith) hath neither time nor ſeaſon limited him, neither day nor howre appointed him, that ſo he might haue his deſire at all times: which hath been thus ordained by nature, as being more fit, and neceſſary for man to multiplie in his kind he being (the liuely image of God, and made to behold his glory) then for brute beaſts, which were created onely for the vſe of man.
                     I know well the anſwere that thoſe two noble Ladies, Poppea the daughter of Agrippina,
                        A pleaſant anſwere. and Iulia the daughter of Augustus made concerning this matter. The one ſayd, that brute beaſts cannot taſte the delight which women receiue that are with child, becauſe they are without reaſon: and

the other ſayd, that when her ſhip was laden with wares, then ſhe could take in paſſengers.
                     
                  
                  
                     The ſignes whereby to know whether a woman be with child of a boy or a wench. CHAP. II.
                     
                     
                        HAuing ſhewne the meanes to know whether a woman be truely conceiued, it will not be from the purpoſe to handle this queſtion for the ſatisfaction of ſome curious minds, who as ſoone as the Chirurgion hath giuen his cenſure that a woman is with child, demaunds preſently of him whether it will be a boy,The difference of ſexe is hard to foretell. or a wench? But as it is very hard to know at the firſt whether the woman be with child or no, ſo by great reaſon muſt it needs be farre more difficult to diſcerne, and diſtinguiſh the difference of the ſexe, and to determine whether it will be a boy or a wench.
                     I know there are ſome that boaſt they can certainely do it, but for the moſt part it hapneth rather by chance, then through either arte or skill. And for proofe thereof, I haue ſhewed them a child newly come from the mothers wombe, onely laying my hand vpon the priuie parts, yet durſt they not be ſo bold as giue their opinion thereof, ſaying, that it were more eaſie to iudge of it when it was in the wombe, ſeeing that from thence might be gathered many euident ſignes: but wee muſt account the greateſt part of them to be vncertaine,

as we haue formerly ſaid. Neuertheleſſe, to diſtinguiſh the Male from the Female, we will preſently ſhew all the marks which we euer knew, or could obſerue, either out of the ancient, or moderne writers.
                     And firſt of all, yong women commonly are with child rather of a boy then of a wench, becauſe they be hoter then the elder women, which was obſerued by Ariſtotle, who ſaith farther,
                           Aristotle.
                         that if an aged woman which neuer had children before, chance to conceiue, one may be ſure it will be a wench. The like hapneth (as ſome write) to women, which conceiue when the winde is in the South, who for the moſt part bring forth daughters, and when the Northwind bloweth, ſonnes.Obſeruation.
                     
                     
                        Hippocrates ſaith,
                           Hipp. Aph.
                         that a woman which goeth with a boy hath a good colour, for a woman in her caſe, but if it be of a wench, ſhe will haue a worſe complexion. Likewiſe if the right breaſt be harder and firmer, the nipple hard, red, and more eminent, the milke white and thicke, which being milked or ſpirtled againſt a ſleeke-ſtone, or ſome ſuch ſmooth thing, continues in a round forme like a pearle,Signes of a boy. and being caſt euen into water it diſſolueth not, but ſinks directly to the bottome: and if you make a cake with the ſaid milke and flower, and in the baking it continues firme, and cloſe, it is a ſigne the woman is with child of a boy. Againe, ſhe that goeth with a boy, hath the right ſide of her belly bigger, and more copped, and there the child ſtirreth ofteneſt. This motion commonly at ſixe

weekes is ſcarſe ſenſible, but at two months and a halfe more manifeſt. The Male child lyeth high aboue the Nauell by reaſon of his heate, and the Female at the bottome of the belly, becauſe of her coldnes and weight. They which be with child of a boy are more quicke and nimble in all their actions, and be in better health of body, without being ſubiect to many infirmities, which commonly happen to women with child of a wench.

                        Auicen obſerueth theſe ſignes, That a woman with child of a boy hath the pulſe of her right ſide ſtronger, higher, and thicker, then that of the left: ſhe will reach out her right hand rather then her left, and in going ſhe wil alwayes ſet forth the right foote formoſt: her right breſt is bigger then the left, and the right eye greater, brighter, and more ſparkling: and if a woman about her laſt months haue any great ſickneſſe, or any throwes, without being deliuerd, it is ſome likelyhod that ſhe is with child of a boy, ſince the male child is faſter tied and bound then the female, becauſe the ligaments which hold and faſten him are ſtronger and dryer then they that bind and ſupport a wench.
                     
                        Signes of a wench.A woman which is with child of a daughter hath a pale, heauy, and ſwarth countenance, a melancolique eye: ſhe is wayward, fretfull, and ſad: ſhe beares in her face as Hippocrates ſaith,

                        Maculam ſolarem, that is to ſay, her face is ſpotted with red, like thoſe who haue been much in the ſunne: her left breſt is bigger then the right; and the top of the nipple blacke. The milke which comes forth of her

breſts is blewiſh, thin, and watriſh: her belly is flat; and ſhe feeles her burthen moue on the left ſide, and that, not before the fourth moneth: the veines of her thighes, and groine, are bigger, and more knottie on the left ſide then on the right. An honeſt Gentlewoman aſſured me that ſhe had made triall of this receipt, which is,An experiment. to take an equall quantitie of Claret wine, and of vrine made in the morning, put them together into a glaſſe, and let them ſtand a whole day, if there appeare in the bottome a groſſe cloud, thicke like to Beane-broth, it is a ſigne the woman is with child of a boy, if it appeare in the middeſt, it is ſigne of a wench, if there be nothing found in the bottome but the ordinary reſidence of vrine, it ſhewes ſhe is not with child at all.
                     An experiment likewiſe may be made out of the practiſe of Liuia,

with his wife a good while after her courſes, or at that time when ſhe hath them: and beſide, he muſt tye his right ſtone as hard as he can endure it; and when he would haue a ſonne, he muſt tye the left. But Ariſtotle ſeemes wrongfully to blame his worthie man, when he ſayth, that the generation of Males or Females depends of the ſtrength of the ſeed, and not of the ſtones, the vſe whereof he ſaith, is not for generation. But experience teacheth vs the contrary, for the countreymen when they would haue a Bull beget a Cow-Calfe, or a Bull-Calfe, they tye the right ſtone for the one, and the left for the other.

                        THe ſignes that a woman hath conceiued two children, doe ſeldome appeare before the third or fourth moneth, which then is knowne, both by the mouing of the children, and alſo by the greatnes and ſwelling of the womans belly. As for the motion, if it be felt ſtrong and forceable both on the right and the left ſide, at the ſame inſtant, then it is apparent, that there be two children. Likewiſe for the greatnes of her belly, if it appeare more ſwollen and bigger then in her other child-bearing, if the ſides be higher then the middle of her belly, and from the nauell downeward there appeare as it were a line or ſeparation

betweene both ſides creaſted; if the woman beare her burthen with difficultie, and her belly fall vpon her thighes and hips, then may you ſafely ſay that ſhe goeth with two children.
                  
                  
                     Of falſe Conception. CHAP. IIII.
                     
                     
                        WOmen are oftentimes deceiued in reckoning themſelues with child, for they thinke themſelues with child when it is nothing but the ſtopping of their naturall ſickneſſe, which keepeth not due courſe. Some haue a falſe conception, which is as it were the beginning of Mola. Others haue the Mola it ſelfe, which we commonly call the Moone-calfe.
                     Falſe conception is a lump of fleſh gathered together commonly like to the gizard of a fowle,What a falſe conception is. which is bigger or leſſer according to the continuance of it, which nature commonly expelleth in the ſecond, third, or fourth month. But the Mola is farre bigger, and continues a yeare or two, yea ten or twelue, and ſometime as long as the woman liues. Of this Mola there be two kinds, the one may be called a true, the other a falſe one.Mola is either true, or falſe. The true Mola is fleſhy, being nothing elſe but an vnprofitable maſſe, without ſhape or forme, hard and firme, bred within the Matrice, and cleauing to the ſides thereof. The falſe Mola is of three ſorts, the one windy, being a collection of groſſe winds: the ſecond watriſh, or a heaping together of waters: the

third humorall, or a meeting of many humors. All three contained within the capacitie of the womb, which doth make them differ from the ſwelling, hardnes, or Scyrehus of the ſaid wombe, or from any fleſh, water, or humor, which may chance to cleaue to, or touch the outward part thereof. Theſe are often bred together with the child,Mola bred together with the child. but then they cauſe death, either for that the child is deceiued of his nouriſhment which is carried to the Mola; or becauſe he wanting roome, cannot grow and come to perfection.
                     
                        
                           Hippocrates.
                        
                        Hippocrates ſaith, that there be ſome liuing and ſome dead Moles. The dead are like to the falſe burthens, ſo called, becauſe women carry them not long, as being but lightly tyed and faſtned to the ſides of the Matrice. Sometime they are deuided into diuers ſeuerall pieces, ſo that Nicholas Nicolus ſaith, he ſaw a woman which caſt forth nine of them in one day, the leaſt whereof waighed foure pound. The quicke and liuing Moles are they which wholy cleaue to the wombe, and continue with the woman euen to her death.
                     
                        Cauſe of the fleſh Mole.The cauſe of the fleſhy Mole according to the ancient writers cannot wholly proceede from the woman, but the man muſt adde ſomewhat thereunto. Galen holdeth, that it is bred when the mans ſeed is weake, barren, imperfect, or in little quantitie; and for the moſt part choked through the abundance of the menſtruous bloud, which is groſſe and thicke, vnfit for the framing of a child, ſo that in ſtead thereof is bread a lumpe of fleſh that by

little and little increaſeth, being wrapped in his owne membrane, which nature effecteth, as deſirous to bring forth any thing rather then to be idle.
                     The windie Mole is ingendred through want of heate in the Matrice, and other parts adioyning,Windie Mole. as the Liuer and Spleene, whereby much wind is bred and ſhut vp in the emptineſſe of the wombe. It may alſo come from without, as in women newly deliuered, and in ſuch which hauing had their naturall courſes in great abundance, doe venture too ſoone into the cold aire.
                     The watry Mole proceeds from the abundance of watrie ſhowres which is ſent from the Liuer,Watry Mole. or the Spleene, or other parts thereabouts; or elſe through the weakenes of the Matrice, which cannot aſſimilate the bloud that is brought to nouriſh it, part whereof is turned into water, and being not voided, ſtayeth in the wombe.
                     The humorall Mole is bred by reaſon of too much moiſture, as of ſerious, or whayiſh humors,Humorall of the whites, or watriſh euacuations, which come downe through the veſſels of the Matrice, and are ſtayed in the concauitie thereof.
                     Falſe conception hath ſome common ſignes with the true, as ſuppreſſion of the naturall courſes,Common ſignes. depraued appetite, diſtaſtfulneſſe, vomiting, ſwelling of the belly and breaſts, ſo that it is very hard to diſtinguiſh the one from the other. But theſe that follow are more proper to the falſe,Signes of falſe conception. then the true birth: for (as Hippocrates ſaith) In falſe conception, or Mola, the face is commonly puft vp, their

breaſts which were ſwollen at the beginning, doe fall, and dayly wax ſoft, limber, and lanke, and without milke. In the end, the face, breaſts, armes, thighes, and legs grow leane and thin: true it is, that they ſwell towards night, like thoſe that haue the dropſie, the belly riſeth and groweth quickly, and withall very hard, for the moſt part of an equall roundneſſe, with diuers pricking paines in the bottome of the belly that neuer ceaſe, which makes them that they can hardly walke, being hindred as it were with a heauie burthen, and hauing oftentimes a windineſſe in the wombe, as Ahaſis reporteth.
                     
                        Signes from the motion.The ſaid Hippocrates obſerueth, how that by the motion it may eaſily be knowne, for in true conception the male child beginneth to ſtirre at the end of the third moneth, or ſooner; and the female at the third or fourth moneth: and where there is no ſuch quickning, we muſt obſerue whether there be any milke in the breſts, if there be none found, it is a ſigne that it is a Mole.The child moueth of it ſelfe, and not the Mole. Beſide, the mother feeleth the child moue euery way, both on the right ſide, and on the left, as much aboue, as below, and in the middle, without any helpe. But in falſe conception, though there be ſome motion, it is not animall, but proceedeth rather from the expulſiue facultie of the Mother then of the Mole, which hauing no liuing ſoule endeuoureth not of it ſelfe to come forth, neither prouoketh the wombe as the child doth, who hauing neede of aire to breath in, ſeekes after it. But this is a moſt euident ſigne when

the woman lyes downe on either ſide, for then ſhe feeles it fall like a boule, and is not able to vphold, or ſtay it; yea, and being laid on her backe, if her belly be preſſed or cruſhed, it will remaine in the place whither it is thruſt, without comming backe againe. Now that which moſt aſſureth vs, is,True ſignes. when the nine moneths are paſt, and the woman not deliuered, but her belly growes bigger, and ſwelleth more and more, and all the other parts grow leane and leſſe, this is a ſure ſigne of a Mole, though there be ſome women that haue borne their children ten, yea, eleuen moneths.
                     The ſignes of the windy Mole are theſe,Signes of the windy. the belly is equally ſwollen and ſtretched like a bladder, ſofter then in the fleſhy Mole, and chiefely neere the groine and neather belly, which being ſtruck vpon ſoundeth like a Tabour: ſometime it decreaſeth, and otherwhile it ſwelleth more: it is ſooner bred and increaſed then the fleſhy or watery, and ſtretches the belly as though it would teare it, which is not proper to the fleſhy.
                     As for the watery and humorall,Signes of the watry and humorall. the ſignes are almoſt alike, the belly growes big, and riſeth by little and little. If you touch it with your finger ſometimes the print thereof will remaine behind: it is euen, without any hardneſſe. It is true, that the woman lying on her backe, her flancks are fuller and bigger then the middle and bottome of the belly, which waxe flat, the water and humor running frō one ſide to the other; and in ſhaking the belly, they feele a ſwimming and floting of water.
                     
                        
                        Difference betweene the Watry and Humorall.This difference may be alſo added, that in the the watriſh the flancks, groine, and ſometime the thighes are more diſtended and ſwollen then in the humorall, becauſe the wateriſh ſubſtance ſtealeth thither ſooneſt: beſides, that which paſſeth forth and bloweth below is cleare like water, without any ill ſmell; but that which floweth in the humorall is reddiſh, and like to the waſhing of fleſh, and of a bad ſent. This alſo is to be obſerued, that in the falſe conception the naturall courſes flow not, and that the Nauell doth ſhew it ſelfe but little, or not at all, as it commonly doth when the Mother is with child. Concerning the cure thereof, I meane (god-willing) to handle it hereafter.
                  
                  
                     What dyet and order a woman with child ought to keepe. CHAP. V.
                     
                     
                        THat a woman with child may enioy her perfect health, ſhe muſt diligently obſerue that which conſiſteth in the vſe of the ſixe things not naturall, which are the Aire, Meate and Drinke, Exerciſe and Reſt, Sleeping and Waking, Fulneſſe and Emptineſſe, and the Paſſions of the Minde.
                     
                        Good Aire fit for a woman with childFirſt therefore ſhe muſt dwell and liue in a good and well tempered Aire, which is neither too hote, nor too cold, or wateriſh: not ſubiect to any foggie miſts, or winds, and eſpecially the South-wind. For

(as Hippocrates ſaith) when thoſe winds doe blow vpon euery light occaſion, women miſcarrie. The Northwind alſo is hurtfull vnto them, for thoſe winds breed thin rheumes, diſtillations, &amp; troubleſome Coughs in great-bellyed women,The Cough naught for women with child. cauſing them oftentimes to abort, or be deliuered before their due time. Likewiſe ſuch winds as bring with them ill ſmells and vapours, which being drawne in together with the Aire we breathe, into the Lungs, do many times breed very dangerous and troubleſome diſeaſes. Aristotle ſaith,Bad ſmells to be auoided. that the ſmell of a Candle put forth, may cauſe a woman to abort, or looſe her fruite: wherefore ſhe muſt beware of all ill Aire, and make her abode in houſes well and pleaſantly ſeated, ſhunning as much as may be poſſible all bad ſauours.
                     Concerning her Dyet,Her Dyet. ſhe muſt vſe meates which be of good nouriſhment, and breede good iuice, moderately drying. The quantitie muſt be ſufficient both for her ſelfe, and for her child, and therefore they are to be diſpenced withall from faſting at any time: for ſometime too much abſtinence makes the child weake and ſickly, and cauſeth him often to be borne before his time, ſeeking after nouriſhment, which he cannot find within his Mothers body. As alſo the too great quantity of meate his Mother takes, may often ſtifle him,Too much meate ſtifleth. or elſe make him grow ſo big, that he cannot keepe himſelfe in his place, which conſtraines him either to come forth, or elſe makes him ſickly, ſeeing that thoſe meates are corrupted wherewith he is nouriſhed

a fed. Hippocrates writeth in Epidem. that the Siſter of Caius Duellius after ſhe had eate her fill, aborted.
                     All meates which are either too hote, cold, or too moiſt, are to be auoided, and chiefely in the beginning of meales;Salt meates bad. as alſo thoſe which are too ſalt, or ouer-much ſpiced; and likewiſe all baked meates are vtterly forbidden. Aristotle and Plinie write, that if a woman with child eate much ſalt meate, her childe will be borne without nayles; which ſhewes, that he will not be long liued. Her Bread muſt be of good Wheate, well kneaded, light, and alſo well baked.Fit meates. For her meate ſhe may vſe Henne, Chicken, Capon, yong Pigeons, Turtle, Pheaſants, Larks, Partridge, Veale, &amp; Mutton: and for Herbs, let her take Lettuſe,Hearbs. Endiue, Borage, Bugloſſe, and Sorrell, abſtaining from all raw Sallads. She may cloſe her ſtomacke after meate with Peares, or Quinces bak't or preſerued; as likewiſe with Cheries, or Damſons. She muſt ſhun all diureticall things,Diureticall and windy meates are naught. which prouoketh either vrine, or the naturall courſes, and ſuch as are windie, as Peaſe and Beanes. Notwithſtanding, women with child haue oftentimes ſuch diſordinate appetite, by reaſon of ſome ſalt or ſharp humor which is contained within the membranes of the ſtomacke, that they deſire to eate Coles, Chalke, Aſhes, Waxe, Salt-fiſh raw, yea and vnwatred; and to drinke Veriuice, and Vineger, yea very dregs, ſo that it is impoſſible to hinder them from eating and taſting them. But yet they muſt refraine and ouer-maiſter themſelues

therein as much as they can, ſince that ſuch foode may much hurt and hinder both their owne and their childs health. Neuertheleſſe if they cannot forbeare, ſuffer them a little, and let them haue their longings, for feare leaſt it ſhould proue worſe with them.Accidents that may happen. For I haue ſeene many women which being hindered and forbidden frō vſing ſuch traſh, haue preſently fallen into trauell: and in others, their children haue carried the marks of ſome of the things they ſo earneſtly deſired and longed after. Beſide, although that ſuch meates for the moſt part are very bad and contrary,

                         yet for the deſire they haue to eate them they are digeſted commonly without hurting the partie at all. Meate and drinke (ſaith Hippocrates) is better and fitter, though it be ſome-what worſe, then that which is better, and not ſo agreeable and pleaſing.
                     For her Drinke ſhe may vſe Claret wine, mature,Her Drinke. and not too ſtrong, which ſhe muſt allay very well. For this Wine hath power to comfort and ſtrengthen the ſtomacke, and all the other parts ſeruing for nouriſhment and generation: and if ſhe cannot away with Wine, let her drinke Hydromell, or Barley-water well boyled.
                     Her ſleepe muſt be in the night,Her Sleepe. the better to digeſt the meate ſhe hath taken: for watchings doe ingender crudities and diſeaſes, which cauſe vntimely births in ſtead of faire and goodly children; and chiefely, ſhe muſt auoid ſleeping after dinner. But in the morning ſhe may take her eaſe, as ſhe ſhall thinke beſt, yet not turning (as ſome great Ladies

do) the day into night, and the night into day.
                     
                        Exerciſe.She may vſe moderate exerciſe, but violent motion looſneth the Cotiledons or veſſels of the Matrice whereby the child receiues his nouriſhment. They muſt be forbid riding in Waggins or Coaches, eſpecially in the three firſt months: for as vpon a ſmall occaſion we ſee the fruits and flowers of trees do fall (as by ſome little wind that ſhakes the tree, or the like,) ſo many times through a light cauſe women great with child,Cauſes of Abortment. in ſtirring or moouing themſelues, yea, or but ſetting their foot awry, may be deliuer'd before their time.
                     It was not without good cauſe that the Romanes forbad their Wiues to ride in Coaches, the which alſo ought to be obſerued in theſe dayes, eſpecially by thoſe who are ſubiect to take hurt, and therefore let them walke gently, taking an eſpeciall heed and care to themſelues the firſt three moneths.
                     
                        Great noyſes hurtfull.She muſt ſhun all great noyſe and ſounds, as of Thunder, Artillery, and great Bells. Galen in his booke de Theriaca, ſayth, that many women with child haue died with the very fright they receiued by a clap of thunder: and when ſhe is afraid of hurting her ſelfe or falling into trauaile, let her be carried in a Chaire or Litter between two ſtrong men, and chiefely two howres before meales: for as a woman may eaſily looſe her burthen the firſt moneth, becauſe her child (though he be but little) is not yet firmely faſtned and tyed to the wombe, ſo likewiſe being great or big through his weight, he may fall downe, and come forth; wherefore all violent

exerciſe, and too much labour,Violent exerciſe hurtfull. is hurtfull and dangerous for her; as alſo to fret, chide, or laugh immoderately. The fourth, fifth, and ſixth moneth ſhe may vſe more libertie, the ſeuenth and eight ſhe muſt keepe herſelfe ſtill and quiet, but when ſhe is in her ninth moneth, then may ſhe vſe more ſtirring, and exerciſe. And therefore is it that Ariſtotle in his Politicks appointeth,Sentence of Ariſtotle. that women with child ſhould not be ſedentary, nor liue too nicely, but that ſince God hath bleſſed them to beare children, they ſhould dayly viſit the Temples of the Gods for their exerciſe.
                     The which Plato expreſſely commandeth in his Common-wealth, and by a kind of deuotion,Opinion of Plato. and religious pietie. But Ariſtotle in that place ſpeaketh like a Phyſition, as he ſheweth in his booke de Generatione. In the Countrey (ſaith he) where women accuſtome themſelues to labour, they are brought abed more eaſily, and with leſſe paine. In briefe, where women exerciſe themſelues,Women that labour are eaſily deliuered. they are ſooner deliuered, for their exerciſe conſumes the excrements, which idle and ſlothfull women gather and heape together.
                     In the firſt foure moneths ſhe muſt likewiſe abandon Venus for feare of ſhaking the child,Venus forbidden. and bringing downe her courſes, which muſt alſo be obſerued in the ſixth and eight moneth, but in the ſeuenth and ninth ſhe may boldly vſe it, eſpecially toward the end of the ninth moneth, which ſome are of opinion will help and haſten the deliuery.
                     
                        Aristotle is of this opinion, (though herein he

contradicts the authority of Hippocrates,
                        
                           Aristotles opinion.) The woman with child (ſaith he) ought not to haue the company of her husband. But Aristotle and Hippocrates may eaſily be reconciled; the Philoſopher meaneth, that they ſhould not embrace their wiues all the time of their being with child, but onely toward the time of their lying in, thereby to ſhake the child, and make him come the more readily forth; for comming into the world after this acte, he is commonly enwrapped and compaſſed with ſlime, which helpeth his comming forth.
                     
                        Her belly muſt be ſoluble.It is alſo requiſite that her belly be looſe, not retaining her excrements, and that ſhe haue (if it be poſſible) euery day the benefit of Nature, which if it be not done naturally, it muſt be helpt, taking euery morning ſome broth of Damaske-Prunes; Alſo Apples ſtued with Suger, and a little Butter, is very fit and good. She may vſe Broth wherein Borage, Bugloſſe, Purſlane, Lettuſe, Patience, and a little of the herbe Mercury hath beene boyled. She may likewiſe take Suppoſitaries ſo they be not too ſharpe.Cliſters. Cliſters made of a Calues-head, or of a Sheepes-head, boyled with Annis-ſeed, and Fennil-ſeed, wherein ſome courſe Suger, and oyle of Violets is diſſolued, are very conueniēt, vſing them neuertheleſſe with diſcretion, leauing out all manner of ingredients which might cauſe a fluxe of the belly,

                     Notwithſtanding the ſame Hippocrates is of opinion, that women with child in caſes of neceſſitie

may be purged from the fourth to the ſeuenth moneth,A Woman with Child may be purged. but before and after thoſe times he admits it not, nay, he forbids it directly; which for all that the Phiſitions of our time obſerue not in caſes of danger, becauſe the Medicines we vſe in theſe dayes, as Rubarbe, Manna, Caſſia, and Tamarinds, are not ſo violent as thoſe that were vſed by our Ancients, which were Hellebor, Scammony, Turbith, Coloquintida, or the like: and wee muſt take eſpeciall care of giuing them any opening things which may either prouoke vrine,Opening medicines muſt be auoided. Lib. 5. Aph. 60. or their naturall courſes; for as the ſame Author ſaith, It is impoſſible for the child to be healthfull if the mother haue her naturall ſicknes.
                     Bloud-letting is forbid them, vnleſſe it be very needefull, eſpecially if the child be growne any thing big, becauſe he hath more neede of foode and nouriſhment, then at the beginning when he was little: for take away his ſuſtenance, and he will waxe leane and feeble, being oftentimes driuen for want thereof to ſeeke a paſſage forth. Notwithſtanding there are ſome women ſo ſanguine and full of bloud that we are forced to take ſome of it away, leaſt the child be ſtifled with the ouer-great quantitie thereof, or when they fall into diſeaſes where it is neceſſary to open a veine.Conſiderations concerning Bloud-letting. The fitteſt time (if it be not in caſe of neceſſitie) is from the fourth, to the ſeuenth moneth. I haue ſeene a woman with child who for a Pleuriſie was let bloud eleuen ſeuerall times, and yet ſtayed her full terme, and was well deliuered.
                     
                        
                        Paſſions of the mind.Now concerning the paſſions of the minde, a woman with child muſt be pleaſant and merrie, ſhunning all melancholike and troubleſome things that may vexe or moleſt her mind: for as Aristotle ſaith, A woman with child muſt haue a ſetled and quiet mind, which Auicen alſo counſelleth, that thoſe which haue conceiued, ought to be preſerued from all feare, ſadneſſe, and diſquietnes of mind, without ſpeaking or doing any thing that may offend or vexe them;An obſeruation. For great bellied women. ſo that diſcreet women, and ſuch as deſire to haue children, will not giue eare vnto lamentable and fearefull tales or ſtoryes, nor caſt their eyes vpon pictures or perſons which are vglie or deformed, leaſt the imagination imprint on the child the ſimilitude of the ſaid perſon or picture, which doing, women ſhall be ſure to be well and happily deliuered, and that (With the help of God) they ſhall beare their burthen to the full terme, which ſhall be ſent into the world without much paine, promiſing them a happie and ſpeedie deliuerie. To conclude, they muſt leaue off their Busks as ſoone as they perceiue themſelues with child, not lacing themſelues too ſtraight, or cruſhing themſelues together,She muſt take need of lacing her ſelfe too hard. for feare leaſt the child be miſhapen and crooked, or haue not his naturall growth: and their garments muſt be rather light and thin, then heauie and cumberſome.
                  
                  
                     
                     How a woman muſt gouerne her ſelfe the nine moneths ſhe goeth with child. CHAP. VI.
                     
                     
                        NOw I haue preſcribed what manner of life a woman ought to leade, while ſhe is with child: ſhe may obſerue (if it pleaſe her) this that followeth, though not ſo neceſſary, yet commodious and profitable both for the maintaining of her health, and preſeruation of her beauty. To the end then that her breaſts after her deliuery, be neither too big and puſt vp,To preſerue the breaſts. nor yet hanging downe like bags, and to preuent the danger that might happen vnto her, by the too great quantity of bloud, that is turned into milke, (which may be curdled, and ſo ſuppurate, and putrifie.) As ſoone therefore as ſhe knowes her ſelfe to be with child, (as in the ſecond or third moneth) let her weare a chaine of gold about her necke. Some preferre a chaine of ſteele, or elſe a little gad of ſteele put betweene the two breaſts, as likewiſe to put a piece of corke there, and to weare vnder her arme-pits two little pieces more of the ſame. This Fomentation alſo is very good.
                     Take of Periwinckle, Sage, and ground-Iuy,A Fomentation. of each a handfull, Hemlocke halfe a ſmall handfull, boyle them in wine and water, and when you haue taken it from the fire put thereto a little roſe-vineger. And with this decoction warme, bath your

breaſts in the morning with a cloth or ſpung dipt therein, a quarter of an houre, wiping and drying them afterwards with reaſonable warme clothes. The like may be done with the waters of the ſame hearbs,What muſt be done, the 3. and 4. Moneth. and about the third or fourth moneth, when ſhe feeles her ſelfe quicke, about which time her belly begins to ſwell and grow big, ſhe muſt weare a Swathe (made fit for the purpoſe) to ſupport her belly, being firſt annointed with this Liniment or Pomade, which ſhe ſhall continue till the ninth moneth, to keepe her belly from being full of knottie and broken vaines, furrow'd and wrinckled, making it grow deformed, vnſeemely, and hanging downe lower then is fit, which hapneth by reaſon of the great burthen and weight of the child, that ſtretcheth and inlargeth the skinne thereof, and cauſeth them to indure great paine in their belly and groine.
                     
                        The Pomade or Liniment approued. Take of Kids ſewet, and the fat of a Sow, of each three ounces, of Capons and Gooſe-greaſe, of each an ounce and halfe, cut them ſmall, and melt them in an earthen pot, putting thereto as much water as will ſuffiſe, then ſtraine them through a cloth, and waſh them in water till they waxe very white, and haue loſt their ſauour. Afterward melt them againe in a double veſſell, adding thereto anounce of the marrow of a Hart, or Stag, then waſh it againe with Roſe-water, or other ſweet ſmelling water, mingling therewithall (if you thinke fit, or that it will not be hurtfull to the wombe) two or three graines of Muske or Ciuet.
                     
                        Some vſe this oyntment: Take dogs greaſe,Another Liniment- and the fat about a ſheepes kidney, of each two ounces, Spermaceti one ounce, oyle of ſweet Almonds an ounce and a halfe, the fats muſt be melted, prepared, and waſhed as before, then melted againe with the reſt, and waſhed with roſe or ſweet water.
                     Some take good ſtore of Sheepes-feet well bruſed and broken in pieces, to the number of thirty or forty, and boyle them well in water, then taking off the fat, and marrow that ſwimmeth on the top, which they waſh well in common water, and take therof two ounces, of Ducks-greaſe as much,Another. Spermaceti one ounce, white Waxe ſixe drams, melt them altogether in a double veſſel, and waſh them in the aboue named waters.
                     Some Ladyes and Gentlewomen which loue not to rub their bellies euery morning with any of theſe liniments, weare thereon a Dog-skin, or ſome other wel prepared and dreſſed, as followeth; and change it euery fifteene dayes, or according as it will laſt and continue, not taking it off, except it ſhriuell and grow wrinckled.
                     Take a Dog-skin, or ſome other skin ready dreſſed to make gloues of, waſh it often in common water, afterward in Roſe-water, and dry it in the ſhade, and being thus dreſt and dryed, lay it in ſoke in theſe oyles and fats following:
                     Take of Meſues oyntment of Roſes an ounce and halfe, oyle of Saint Iohns wort,The maner to prepare it. and of ſweet Alamonds, of each an ounce, freſh Butter, and Spermaceti, of each halfe an ounce, melt all theſe together

in a double veſſel, and let the skin lie and ſoke in it, three or foure daies, mouing &amp; ſtirring them together daily: then take it foorth, and ſpred, it in the aire, and let it lie there two or three daies till it haue ſok't in all the oile, &amp; become drie: then cut it to the forme &amp; bigneſſe of the belly, and ſo apply it.
                     The daintie and curious may vſe the former liniments and skin: they that haue not the meanes to do either,Another eaſie to be prouided. let them; Take of freſh Butter well waſh't in common water, and then in Roſe-water, three ounces, oile of ſweet Almonds, one ounce, Spermaceti, halfe an ounce: and with theſe melted together, rub their belly.
                     
                        Obſeruation.Theſe Ointments muſt be kept in a gally pot, and couered with Roſe water to keepe them from being muſtie.
                     
                        Gouernment of the ninth Moneth.When the Woman is come to the ninth Moneth, hauing been in good health all the time of her going with child: ſhe muſt continue the vſe of the aforeſaid Ointments, and muſt begin to vſe more exerciſe then ſhe did before, walking gently before meales the firſt twelue or fifteene daies: and then afterward it will be good to vſe ſtronger exerciſe.
                     It will be very profitable for her (eſpecially after the ten or twelue firſt daies of the ninth moneth be paſt) to ſit in the decoction following, after the maner of a halfe Bath, ſome quarter, or halfe an hower in the morning, and then being well dried, and laid to bed, let her be annointed behind, all along the lower part of her backe, and before, from

the Nauill downward; and chiefly vpon Os Pubis, and the groine, with the ointment following.
                     Take of Mallowes Althaea, with their roots,The Bath. Motherwort, of each two handfull, white Lilly roots, three ounces, Chamomill, and Melilot flowers, of each a good handfull, Lin-ſeed, Quince-ſeed, and Foenigreeke, of each an ounce: Boyle them all in ſufficient quantitie of running water, for the Bath.
                     Take of Hensfat, three ounces, Duckes fat,The Ointment. an ounce and a halfe, freſh Butter, two ounces, Linſeed oile, an ounce and a halfe: Melt them all together, then waſh them verie well in Parietarie, and Mugwort water, adding thereto two ounces of the Muccilage of Althaea Roots. In which ſpace, let her take this drinke euery morning faſting.A Drinke. Take of Oile of ſweet Almonds newly drawen without fire, an ounce, white Wine, halfe an ounce, Parietarie water, one ounce, mingle them together. Some haue found good by taking the yelke of an Egge, and drinking a draught of Hypocras after it.
                     Others take a little Wine and water, wherein Lin-ſeed hath been ſtieped.
                     Let this or the like order and gouernment be obſerued, for a Woman that is of a good habit of body, and who in her going with Child, hath not been ſubiect to any ſickneſſe, or accident of moment: bearing her Children well, &amp; without much paine.
                     But becauſe there be many, which are troubled with diuers accidents, which happen in their Childbearing, I thought good heere, to treat thereof briefly, before I ſpeake of their Deliuerie.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of many infirmities, which trouble Women while they are great with Child. CHAP. VII.
                     
                     
                        A Woman muſt haue a care of her Beautie.
                        IT becomes a Woman well at all times, and chiefly in her Child-bearing, and after her Deliuerie, to haue a care, as much as ſhe can poſſiblie, of the preſeruation of her Beautie: ſince there is nothing that ſooner decaies and ſpoileth it, then the often bearing of Children.Health muſt be preferred. But as Health is more precious, and recommendable then Beautie: and ſeeing that a woman with Child may be troubled and oppreſſed with many accidents, and infirmities, during the nine Moneths ſhe beares her child: it will be therefore verie neceſſary and profitable to ſeeke out the meanes to free and deliuer them thereof: For in looſing the Mother, the life of the Child is alſo hazarded.
                           Aristotle.
                         
                        Aristotle in his booke De generatione Animalium, is of opinion, That bruit beaſtes going with young, are not ſubiect to any diſeaſes: and contrariwiſe, that Women are verie often ſicke. Hippocrates ſaith,
                           Hippocrates.
                         That they be pale and wan, to ſhew that they are ſubiect to many infirmities. In times paſt when men and women were ſold like ſlaues, if there were any found that were with child, ſhe was not warranted for whole and ſound by him that fold her,
                           Vitruuius.
                         as Vitruuius writes in his ſecond book; becauſe they were troubled and ſubiect to ſo many

diſeaſes. In the firſt three or foure Moneths ſuch infirmities chiefly happen for many cauſes. Firſt,Why women with Child are ſicke. becauſe they liue (as Ariſtotle ſaith) for the moſt part in idleneſſe, and eate ill meates; which are turned into excrements, and breed many obſtructions, the fountaine and beginning of all diſeaſes: the ſecond is, the great ſuppreſſion and ſtopping of bloud, whereof they were wont to be purged euery Moneth, before their being with Child; which runs to the Matrice to be voided, &amp; find that accuſtomed paſſage; which it had woont to haue: but being not able to get forth, and much leſſe to be ſpent and digeſted, by the Child (which is as yet but little) it returnes backe into the vaines, &amp; chiefly thoſe which are neere the ſtomacke: and through the long continuance, is there corrupted, and changed, to be of a bad qualitie, whereof proceeds this depraued and diſordinate appetite, which the Latins call Pica, or Malacia: Loathing of meat, Hicket, Vomiting,Diuers diſeaſes of women. Paines of the ſtomacke, Flanckes, and Belly, Ache of the backe, Hips, and Groine, difficultie of making water, Panting, and beating of the heart, with Sounning, the Cough, binding and Fluxe of the belly, ſwelling of the Thighs, and Feet, and ſometimes Abortment, not being able to beare their Children the full time: together with many other accidents; whereof we will ſpeake hereafter, beginning with the Pica, which troubleth them oftneſt, and longeſt.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of the diſordinate longing called Pica. CHAP. VIII.
                     
                     
                        WEe commonly ſay the appetite is depraued, when beyond meaſure we couet to eate and drinke too much (in reſpect of what hunger naturally requireth:) Or when we deſire, or long after meats, which are vnuſuall, and offend in qualitie, and are not dreſt and prepared as they ought.
                     Of this depraued Appetite there be diuers ſorts. The firſt is called Boulimos of the Greeks,
                           Boulimos.
                         and of the Latins, Fames vaccina, &amp; appetētia immodica. When they eate more then is requiſite, not being able to ſatisfie themſelues. And if hunger vrge them farther, and grow greater, then it is called of the Latins Appetitus caninus,
                        
                           Canina appetentia.
                         or Fames inſatiabilis, and the partie eates, till he be full, euen to the throat, that he is conſtrained to vomit, his ſtomacke being ſo ouercharged. But then preſently he is driuen to eat againe, and then to vomit: from whence the Prouerbe is taken; He is returned like a Dog, to his vomit. The like hapneth for drinking, as for eating, which the Latins call Sitis immodica,
                        
                           Sitis immodica.
                         which is ſo great, that the tongue cleaues to the roofe of the mouth, not being able to eate or ſpeake except the mouth be firſt moiſtned, and the tongue wetted. This accident is verie hard, yea, euen vnſupportable

to endure, the ſicke party taking no other delight but in drinking, and that often, and in great draughts. Men are more ſubiect to this drougth then women: Contrariwiſe, Women, and chiefly thoſe with child, &amp; ſuch as haue not their Courſes, or Wenches that are ſubiect to the Greene ſickneſſe, are more troubled with this depraued or immoderate appetite, called Malacia, or Pica; hauing this name giuen it,From whence it is called Pica.
                         either becauſe Pyes are troubled with this diſeaſe, or elſe for that their feathers be of diuers colours, blacke and white, according to the varietie of things, which Women long after. This ſickneſſe hapneth when they deſire to eate or drinke things, that are wholie contrarie to Nature, as eating of raw or burnt fleſh, yea, euen to long after Mans fleſh, Aſhes, Coles, old Shoes, Chalke, Waxe, Nutſhels, Morter, and Lime:Storie of Fernelius.
                         as Fernelius witneſſeth of a man, who being a long time deſirous to eat vnſlak't lime, at laſt deuoured thereof the bigneſſe of ones fiſt; which helpt him, without doing him any harme, either in the ſtomacke, or guts. Notwithſtanding, not long ſince, the daughter of M. Forges died, with eating the plaſtering of wals.
                     Sometimes cuſtome, which is a ſecond Nature, makes vs couet to eat ſuch contrarie things, as we deſire, and the rather becauſe we haue commonly eaten thereof in our youth: There is found the contrarie hereof in ſome, who abhor and loath good meates, which is imputed to the Idioſyncraſie or particular conſtitution of the perſon. Others haue

obſerued, that there are ſuch malignant humours ſometimes bred in vs, that they are turned into poiſon, and make both theſe depraued appetites. As it is ſeen by poiſons taken inwardly, and applied outwardly, which make the like effect. The biting of the ſerpent Dipsas doth teſtifie the ſame, which breedeth an intollerable and vnquenchable thirſt in him that hath been wounded by it.
                     Now therefore, leauing all theſe kinds of vitiated and depraued Appetites, we will onely ſpeake of that wherewith great-bellied Women are troubled, which is called Pica.
                     
                     
                        Diuers cauſes of Pica.Some impute the cauſe of this ſickneſſe to certaine Crudities, and ill humours, which are contained in the whole habite of the bodie, and imparted to the mouth, or orifice of the ſtomacke. But the ſoundeſt opinion is, that the ſides and tunicles of the ſtomacke, and orifice thereof, are infected, and ſtuffed with diuers excrements, and ill humours; and according to the qualitie they haue, the Woman with child,Wherefore they deſire diuers things. longeth after the like: As if Melancholie abound, not burn't or aduſt; ſhe longeth after ſharpe things, as Vineger, Citrons, and Orenges: if the Melancholie be aduſt, ſhee deſireth Coles, Aſhes, and Plaſtering: if the humour be ſalt, ſhe coueteth ſalt meates, and ſo of the reſt. And ſurely it often happens, that they long for the like things as are in their ſtomackes. This maligne and bad humour, is ingendred (as we haue ſaid) through the retention of the naturall Courſes in women with Child, which flow backe into the ſtomacke.

In ſome it beginneth the firſt weeks, yea,The beginning of the Pica. the verie firſt day; in others the thirtieth or fortieth day, and continues euen till the fourth moneth, and then ceaſeth: which commeth ſo to paſſe, becauſe the Child is growen bigger, and hauing need of more Nouriſhment, draw's to him a greater quantitie of bloud; the which he conſumes: and ſo by conſequent, it returnes backe no more into the ſtomacke. Beſides alſo, this humour hath been much ſpent and voided, by the often vomitings which Women haue during the firſt moneths. And alſo becauſe the Childs haire is bred, and grown great,The breeding of the haire cauſeth the Pica. which ſome hold to be partly a cauſe of this ſickneſſe. Plinie writes, That women with Child, feel themſelues worſe, when their Childs haire begins to come, and chiefly about the new of the Moone.
                     Now that we may preſerue them from this infirmitie, or at leaſt diminiſh it as much as may bee: ſhe muſt chiefely vſe meats that breed good iuice;Their diet in Pica. and that in little quantitie, increaſing it neuertheleſſe as her bigneſſe augmenteth, and the childe groweth: which at length waxing ſtronger and greater, will conſume part of this great quantitie of bloud, and the reſt may bee put into the membranes which wrap and infold the childe, and to the maſſe of bloud which is called the after-burthen, which is as it were the liuer of the Matrice.
                     Now concerning their meat and drinke: Conſidering that they that are ſicke of this diſeaſe, and ſo infinitely diſtaſted, that often times they doe euen loath and abhorre good meats: therefore wee muſt

ſet an edge (as it were) on their appetite,Meats fit for thoſe that haue the Pica. varying their meats in as many faſhions as may be poſſible, thereby to make them the more pleaſing and deſireable.
                     Oliues and Capers, as likewiſe ſallades a little parboiled, are very good for them.
                     All meats that are either too fat, or too ſweet, bee naught, becauſe they ſtirre vp a deſire of vomiting.
                     For their ſauces: they may vſe Veriuice, Orringes, Citrons, Pomegranats, and good Roſe viniger, all very moderately taken.

                         or the like. Paulus Aegineta allowes them the vſe of muſtard, pepper, and cloues to make ſauce thereof, for the ſtirring vp of their appetite, and to helpe to digeſt the crudities contained within the ſtomacke: after meales ſhe may eat bak't quinces, and roſted filberds. For her drinke, ſhe muſt vſe good clarret wine, well allaied: but if ſhee long for white, you may giue her leaue to drinke ſome, ſo that it haue a little aſtriction.
                     
                        Much drinking is naught in the Pica.True it is, that the ouer great quantitie of drinke is hurtfull for her, by reaſon of the great waſhing which it might make in her ſtomacke: ſhee may take euery morning a draught of Wormewoodwine, or a little ſtrong Hydromel, with a toſt of bread. The vſe of theſe Lozenges is much commended.

                     Concerning generall purgations, which may euacuate downeward part of this ſuperfluitie, they muſt not be adminiſtred when a woman is yoong with childe,Diſcretion in purging. but with very great care, and good aduice, not vſing any ſtrong purgers. But if there bee need, and that the diſeaſe ceaſeth not by light medicines, then may be giuen a little infuſion of Rubarbe, and a gentle decoction of Sene, taking the aduice of the learned Phyſitian. And therefore we muſt onely haue a regard to their vomiting, which at theſe times doth commonly moleſt and trouble them: taking heed of ſtaying it, except it be immoderate (as Auicen ſaith) or too violent.
                           Auicens precept. For otherwaies it helpeth to cure this diſeaſe, euacuating part of thoſe ill humours whereby it is nouriſhed and increaſed. And if wee perceiue ſhe hath a deſire to vomit, and that the expulſiue facultie be not ſtrong enough to helpe it, let her take a little Hydromell warme; and if the matter in the ſtomacke be tough and clammie, adde thereto a little vineger, the better to attenuate, and cut it. I haue beene the longer in this Chapter, becauſe it is an accident that doth much annoy women with childe: thereby the better to inſtruct the yoong Chirurgion, when there is no Phyſitian neere at hand.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of Diſtaſtfulneſſe and Hicket. CHAP. IX.
                     
                     
                        MOſt women, as ſoone as they are with childe, be ſo diſtaſted, and doe ſo loath and abhorre meat, that they cannot endure either to eat, ſee, or ſmell it, yea, and ſome are ſicke euen with the very hearing of it named: which makes them goe often times two or three daies without any deſire to eat. This diſeaſe hapneth vpon the ſame reaſon we gaue before of the depraued appetite,The Cauſe. becauſe the ſtomacke is filled and ſtuffed with diuers excrements (that oloy a great bellied woman) which by little and little are there gathered together, by the flowing backe of the courſes that be ſtopped (which cannot bee put forth, much leſſe conſumed by the little one) and ſo come into the ſtomacke, and fill it.
                     But when theſe corrupted,The Hicket. and ill humours abide longer in the ſtomacke, there happens another accident, commonly called the Hicket, or Yeaxing, which is a violent and conuulſiue motion of the ſtomacke, which ſeemeth to diſcharge it ſelfe of thoſe bad humours, which are contained in the capacity and membranes thereof: and offend either in quantitie, or qualitie, or both together.Diſcommoditie of the Hicket. From hence comes it that the ſtomacke willing to put them forth, caſts vp with all the meat and food, the woman hath taken: to the preiudice of her ſelfe,

which cannot keepe any thing for her owne ſuſtenance) and of the Child, who cannot find ſufficient bloud to nouriſh him: which at length makes them both weake, and cauſeth the Mother either to be deliuered before her time; or elſe to breed a faint and feeble Child, and oftentimes one that will be ſickly all his life time.
                     
                        Cure.For the remedying of this queaſineſſe, we muſt haue recourſe to thoſe medicines, written in the Chapter of depraued Appetite; Both for the dyet and remedies. And touching the Hicket, when it comes through emptineſſe, or want of eating; then the woman muſt nouriſh her ſelfe, taking often good meat, and in ſmall quantitie, as yelkes of egs, cullis, veale, broth, hennes, and chicken: and let her belly be annointed with oyle of ſweet Almonds, and Violets. If the cauſe proceed of any ſharp or biting humour, it muſt be drawen and purged downward gently, as we haue ſaid already: or elſe by vomit,Straining bad for women with child. without much ſtraining Cow milke, and the milke of an Aſſe are verie much commended; as alſo the vſe of ſyrups of Violets, and Nenuphar are verie profitable.
                     The Hicket may alſo come of ſome inflamation, that is in the Spleene, Liuer, or other bowels neere the ſtomacke, and ſo is impart to it: this hapning, it will be verie neceſſarie to let her bloud: and that ſhe vſe meats which moderately coole, as alſo medicines of the ſame nature both inwardly and outwardly: conſulting thereof with the Phyſitions.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of the Vomiting which happens to Women with Child. CHAP. X.
                     
                     
                        THere be ſome women, who as ſoone as they be with child, yea, the verie firſt daies, are ſubiect to Vomit:Women with child Vomit often. caſting vp ſtore of water and ſlime by the mouth: and this vomiting continueth euen till they are quicke with child: and with ſome it remaineth all the time of their going: which I ſaw happen vnto a great Lady of this kingdome; who from the ſecond day after ſhe had conceiued, vomited; and affirmed conſtantly that ſhe was with child.
                     When this Vomiting hapneth,Vomiting muſt not be ſtopt on the ſuddaine. it muſt not be ſtaied ſodainly, if ſo be it continue gently, and without violence: for being ſtopped, there is ſuch ſtore of humors heaped and gathered together in their ſtomacks, that they are ready to be ſtifled, or ſtuft vp; which being by little and little caſt vp without violence, they are much eaſed: for by this euacuation of noyſome excrements, the firſt region of the belly feels it ſelfe free, diſcharged, and vnburthen'd of many long and grieuous paines.Cauſe. The cauſe of this accident proceeds commonly of the abundance of humours gathered together in the ſtomacke: or elſe of ſome ſharpe, and biting humour, that doth ſtir and prouoke it, and chiefly the vpper orifice thereof: aſwell, by reaſon of the ill meats they eate, and that in great quantitie, as alſo becauſe they fill themſelues too much with good meat, which doth putrifie and corrupt, (the naturall

heat being weake) and requires rather to be caſt forth,Accidents of Vomiting. then kept in the bodie. But it hapneth oftentimes, that this Vomiting is ſo violent, that euen the meat and ſuſtenance which the Mother taketh, to nouriſh her ſelfe and the child is caſt vp, and then it muſt be remedied.
                     Likewiſe, if this accident come from ſome weakneſſe of the ſtomack, or by the default of the retentiue facultie, which is not able to retaine and kepe the meat, although it were of good iuice, and in finall quantitie: or by ſome maligne vapour, which ariſeth from the wombe, by reaſon of the feed and naturall courſes retained; they maybe help'd by theſe meanes following.
                     Firſt, if the great quantitie of meates whether good or bad, which the woman hath taken, be the cauſe: then let her abſtaine from eating them: obſeruing the aboue mentioned Dyet, vſing good meats, and in little quantitie; thereby to roule it forth. If the ouermuch quantitie, or ill qualitie of ſharpe and biting excrements, be the cauſe, then muſt they be gently taken away and purged: Notwithſtanding, we muſt refraine from giuing them any purgations with Diagredium, or Coloquint: and alſo from ſuch as do much ſoften and moiſten, as Caſsia, Electuar. Lenitiuum, and the like: becauſe through their moiſture, they relaxe the ſtomacke, and ſo conſequently, all the meanes, which haue correſpondence and traficke with the Matrice: for the ſimilitude of their neruous ſubſtance.
                     
                        Their purges therefore muſt be of Rubart infuſion, and alſo in ſubſtance, of the compound ſyrup of Cichory with Rubarbe; which beſides that they euacuate, doe likewiſe coroborate and ſtrengthen: as alſo of the Syrup of Damaske Roſes, Ma
                              •
                           na, and other which with drawing away the water, doe dry withall. But aboue all pills are very fit for them, becauſe they dry; both for their forme, and alſo for the drying ingredients whereof they are compounded: as thoſe of Rubarb and Sene, made with a little conſerue of roſes,A good precept. adding thereto (if there be any ſuſpition of ſome maligne or bad quality) a little of the confection of Hyacinthvs. This rule muſt be obſerued in the purging of women with child, and hereof muſt be had the counſel of the learned Phiſitian.
                     If ſome maligne vapour be the cauſe; they muſt vſe cordials, as, a little confection of Hyacinthe, the electuary of Gemmis, theſe cordiall Lozenges, or the like.

The which winds being thus incloſed, and not hauing free paſſage, cauſe ſuch intollerable paine, that euen the breathing is thereby hindred, and the pulſe almoſt loſt, which at length might cauſe the woman to be deliuered.

                     Of the paines of the Backe, Hips, and Groine, with difficultie of making water, that happens vnto Women with child. CHAP. XII.
                     
                     
                        THere be ſome Women, which beare their children high, and (as they ſay) within their ſtomacke: ſo that they are nimbler, either in going, or ſtirring: without being let or hindred thereby at all. Others

carrie them verie low,The diuers ſituation of the child. hauing their belly ſtanding verie much out, which brings them much inconuenience: as paine of the Hips, and Groine, and then they complaine, as if thoſe parts, and their belly were rent and torne in pieces. Contrariwiſe, there be others, that hide their child, within their raines, and beare it verie backward; which cauſeth them to haue exceeding great paine in their backs. In the two latter caſes, we had need to helpe them: for as Hippocrates ſaith;
                           Hipp.
                         When women with child are troubled with great paine in their backe, and legs; then are they in danger to be deliuered before their time. The like may be alſo ſaid, of them that haue much paine in their belly and groine.
                     
                        Cauſe of theſe paines.Theſe paines commonly, do rather proceed from the heauineſſe of the child, then of any quantitie of humors, which abound in the bodie. For at that time, the wombe being great, thicke, and full, by reaſon of the child which is big, and large, and of the bed, or after-burthen, and oftentimes filled with great ſtore of water; on which ſide ſoeuer the wombe reſteth, it drawes the ligaments and bonds with it, that hold and faſten it to the foreſaid parts: and by the force of this dilation, and ſtretching, doth cauſe and prouoke paines in the backe, hips, and groine: aſwell by reaſon they are tyed thereto; as likewiſe for the continuitie of thoſe neighbouring parts,The Cure. which touch them. For the remedying whereof, the woman muſt keepe her ſelfe ſtill, and quiet, without much ſtirring, or ſhaking: ſhe muſt eat little, and often, and of meats that be light, and

eaſie of digeſtion: for the ſtomake being full, doth preſſe the body of the Matrice, and thruſts it downward. Therefore ſhe muſt were Swathes, which may helpe to ſupport, and keep vp her belly: that by ſuch a reſt and ſwathing, the ligaments, which are lengthned, and ſtretched, may be ſomewhat brought backe to their proper places: which muſt be confirmed and ſtrengthned by theſe meanes.
                     All the bottome of her backe, and raines muſt be annointed with Vnguentum Comitiſsae, or elſe this ointment.

lift vp the bottome of her belly: by meanes whereof, ſhe ſhall hinder the bodie of the wombe, from preſſing, and cruſhing the bladder, and eſpecially the necke thereof, which is loaded and oppreſſed with the ſaid wombe. You may applie below, ſome bathing or fomentation, made with the leaues of Mallowes, Althaea, Creſſes, and Parietarie, with a little Lin-ſeed, to make the paſſage more looſe, ſoft, and eaſie to be inlarged, or widened.

                        AS there be diuers winds and vapours, that are ſhut vp, and incloſed in the neather belly of a woman with child, which procure great paines in her hips, backe, and groine: for the reaſons before rehearſed.Cauſe of the trembling of the Heart. So likewiſe are there the like vapours, that ariſe from the wombe, and other parts neere, which are incloſed in the Arteries, and by them are carried, and imparted to the heart, which cauſe a panting, and beating: and the heart feeling it ſelfe offended, and oppreſſed by the ſaid vapours, endeuoureth by his motion, to expell and driue them away,The wiſedom of Nature in all her works. far from itſelfe, (Nature hauing giuen to euery part, ſome particular meanes, whereby to repell, and thruſt backe that, which

doth annoy, or moleſt it. As the Braine by ſneeſing; the Lungs by coughing; and the ſtomacke by vomiting. But becauſe this accident is oftentimes the forerunner of a Syncope, or ſwouning, therefore will it be needfull to haue care thereof, it being eaſie to be knowne, both by the relation of the party, who finds her heart beate, as alſo by feeling the breaſt vppon the region of the heart with ones hand, with which this motion lifteth vp the ribs and the hand that is laide thereon, yea ſome women haue ſuch a beating, that it makes euen the ribs ſtand out of their place. For remedy whereof, ſuch vapors muſt be kept from ſeaſing vpon the hart, which may be done by well fenſing of it, both within, and without.
                     If then you perceiue that the woman doe abound with any ill humors, from whence theſe vapours may partly ariſe: ſhe muſt bee purged (as before,) and let bloud, according as the accidents doe require, and the ancients doe appoint, which muſt be done in ſmall quantity, and that, not all at once: but rather at mâny times by little and little. For according to Galen.
                        How a woman with child muſt be let bloud. There is no remedy that more hinders, and altars the courſe of blood and noyſome vapors, from piercing and aſſailing the heart, then letting of bloud doth.

                        CHAP. XIIII. Of the Cough.
                     
                        ONe of the moſt grieuous, and almoſt inſupportable accidents, that can happen to a woman with childe, is the Cough: the which being violent, oftentimes cauſeth

head-ach, pain of the ſides, flanks and belly,Inconueniences of the cough. vomiting, &amp; watching, the woman not being able to ſleepe, or take any reſt, for the great concuſſion and agitation which is made through the whole body, which oftentimes puts the woman in danger, to be deliuered before her ordinary time.
                     For the moſt part it proceedeth of ſome ſharpe and biting vapours,Cauſe. which ariſe from the nether parts, or elſe by the diſtillation of ſome thinne humor, that comes from the braine, and falleth trickling vpon the Trachea Arteria, or wind pipe, &amp; the lungs, which prouokes them to cough, &amp; yet bringing vp little or nothing: the diſtilation may alſo be of ſome thicker humor which falleth downe vpon the ſaid parts.
                     Therefore wee muſt haue reſpect to the antecedent cauſe,Cure. by hindering ſuch vapors and humors from breeding, then ſtaying thoſe, which may flow or fal downe: if there be any cauſe or matter ioined with it, already fallen and impacted in the lungs &amp; breſt, then muſt it be brought vp by ſpetting.
                     For the helping hereof,Dyet. they muſt auoide all ſalt and ſpiced meates, as alſo thoſe that are ſharp, and biting eſpecially if it be cauſed by ſome vapours or deſtillation of a thinne or ſerous humour.
                     Concerning generall medicines:Generall medicines. if it bee accompanied with a feuer, or ſome great heat, it will not be amiſſe to draw a little bloud. then (the better to turne the courſe of the diſtillation): which cauſeth the cough to apply cupping glaſſes vpon the ſhoulders, with ſome light ſcarification. And if the cough

ſhould bee of ſo long continuance,Cautery. I would counſell you to lay a cautery in the hollowneſſe of the nape of the neck: which I haue practiſed with good ſucceſſe, but it muſt not be done before you haue tried the medicines following, and when the cough is great and violent.
                     
                        Frictions.The rubbing of the armes, ſhoulders, and backe muſt not bee omitted, as alſo when the haire is ſhauen away to apply Emplaſterum de Betonica, vpon the head, to ſtay the Rhume.
                     If the cough be dry, proceeding from ſome thin and ſharpe humor or vapour, it muſt bee thickned, contrariwiſe if the humour be tough and thicke, it muſt be cut, and attenuated, by concocting both, and therefore in this caſe, the vſe of Medicines, that do dull, the ſence therof, are very profitable to mittigate violent Coughs: of which kind are theſe that follow. If the humor bee thin and ſharpe this Iulep taken twice or thrice is very fitte.

                     Let them often hold in their mouth ſuger candy, eſpecially that which gathers about the pot ſide, wherein ſirop of Violets or the like hath beene put.

Let them vſe Trochiſcks, iuice of Licoriſe, and ſometime chawe a peece of Lichoriſe in their mouth. The Lozenges of Diatragacanthum frigidum, Diairis ſimplex, and ſuger of Roſes, are very good. The vſe of Lohocs is very diſtaſtfull, but in ſteed thereof, let them vſe Syrup of Iuiubes, of dryed Roſes, and a little diacodium mingled together, I haue ſeene this medicine doe much good, eſpecially when the cough is great, and that they feele ſome excoriation, and roughnes in the throat.A medicine to take away the roughnes of the throat.

                     Let them take of this medicine in a ſpoone, ſwallowing it down verie gently, that ſo ſome of it may the better ſlide downe the ſides of the windpipe.
                     It will be very fit to rub their breaſt all ouer with freſh butter, or oyle of ſweet Almonds: and if they finde any heat, let them vſe oyle of Violets waſhed with Barley water well boyled.Sleeping ſtoppeth fluxes.
                     
                     And becauſe there is nothing, that ſtayeth deſtillations, better then ſleepe: and that thoſe who haue the cough ſleepe little, it will be very good to make the patient ſleepe, without giuing any violent ſleeping medicine, this Iulep may bee giuen very ſafely.

                        CHAP. XV. of Coſtiuenes, wherwith women with child are troubled.
                     
                        AMongſt many other accidents wherewith women with child are troubled, there are two, the one contrary to the other whereunto they be much ſubiect: that is, either they are bound, and cannot go to the ſtoole but with much inconuenience, and very ſeldome: or elſe they are alwaies looſe and ſubiect to the fluxe.Contrary accidents in women with child. Both may put the woman in danger of miſcarrying. For when ſhe is bound, with much ſtrayning, and that violently to vnburthen nature, the ligaments may bee looſened, or ſome veine opened: and cauſe fluxe of bloud: which may make her fall into trauaile, and therefore it is fit to prouide for it.
                     
                        Cauſe of Coſtiueneſſe.The retention of the excrements, and coſtiuenes of the belly, may happen, either becauſe they haue vſed to be ſo naturally, or by alteration, and change of yeares, for as Hippocrates ſaith, they who haue their belly moiſt in their youth, in their age will haue it hard and drie, and ſo contrariwiſe. This accident happens to others, becauſe the guts are not prouoked &amp; ſtirred vp by the cliſter of nature (which

is the gall,) that they may expell, and thruſt foorth their excrements. There might bee alledged many more reaſons, which at this time I will leaue to ſpeake of, and onely frame my ſelfe to that which moſt commonly is the cauſe of it in women with child, which is referred to two points,Other cauſes of Coſtiuenes either becauſe the guts are preſſed by the vneuennes of the wombe, which is too full, and beeing placed vpon them (and chiefly vpon the great gut) cruſhes and thruſts them one againſt another, in ſuch ſort, that they haue no meanes to inlarge and dilate themſelues, thereby to uoid the excrements contained within them. The other is becauſe the guts, and the excrements within them, are commonly very hard, and dried in women with child, through the great heate, that is in the intrailes, which makes them that they cannot eaſily flow. The ſedentary life alſo, that women leade, is cauſe that their excrements are ſtayed, and gather themſelues together, by little and little, and at the length ſtoppe vp the paſſage. This accident brings vnto them, fluſhing in the face, headach, beating of the Arteries; yea and oftentimes an Ague.
                     For the curing of this diſeaſe a good order in dyet is verie needfull:Cure. vſing meates that doe moiſten, and keepe the guts ſupple, and ſlipperie, and withall ſoften the excrements: which muſt bee done with very great diſcretion: for too much moyſture may at length ouer much relaxe the ligaments of the the wombe, and of the child, and thereby haſten the deliuery.
                     
                        Notwitſtanding, a woman with child being too coſtiue, may vſe tender meats, as Veale, wherewith they may make Brothes,Brothes to looſen the belly. with Lettuce, Purcelane, Sorrell, Spinach, Beets, Bugloſſe, Violet leaues, and ſometime a little of the herbe called Mercurie. Let them vſe Prunes, and bak't Apples. Some take two or three gulps of freſh water before their meales: but let them vſe gentle exerciſe to make their excrement follow the more freely. It is alſo verie fit for a woman with child, in the morning when ſhe riſeth, and at night when ſhe goeth to bed, to make proffer to vnburthen nature, without ſtraining her ſelfe, but verie gently. If for all this her belly will not be correſpondent; it will not be amiſſe to giue her Clyſters.

                     Of the Fluxe, or looſeneſse of the Belly, which troubleth women with child. CHAP. XVI.
                     
                     
                        THe Laske, in what maner ſoeuer it be, doth put the woman in danger of comming before her time: and that for diuers reaſons. Firſt,Fluxe of the belly dangerous. becauſe thereby the meat they take for their nouriſhment, is voided too ſoone, which ſhould haue ſtaied and been turned into bloud, for the nouriſhing and ſuſtaining both of the Mother, and the child. And therefore, they both remaine weake, and feeble, which compelleth the child to come foorth, and ſeeke for food elſe where. For as the Prouerbe ſaith;Prouerbe. 
                        Hunger makes the Wolfe come foorth of the wood. Beſide, the Mother is ſo troubled with riſing out of her bedde, as alſo with much ſtraining her ſelfe, (eſpecially if it bee the bloudie Flixe) that the wombe oftentimes is ouerturned, and relaxed: and cauſeth the childe to bee caſt foorth of his place, by reaſon of the moiſtneſſe which runneth continually along the great gut, vpon which the wombe is placed.
                     Women with great bellies are commonly ſubiect thereto, becauſe of the meats they eat,Women with child are ſubiect to looſeneſſe of the belly. which are of ill iuice: whereby the ſtomacke being weakned,

and not able to concoct them, the expulſiue faculty is compel'd to thruſt them downward, halfe concocted, and indigeſted: otherwiſe they are corrupted, and turned into ſome maligne, ſharpe, and biting humours: as into fretting, choller rotten flegme, or melancholie, which doe corrode and ſtir vp the bowels, and ſo cauſe the fluxe of the belly.
                     
                        The Cure.Concerning the cure of it, many conſiderations muſt be had. And firſt, it will be verie fit to know of what kind, the fluxe is, and what may be cauſe thereof. Now, all Fluxes of the belly muſt needs be one of theſe three; either Diarrhaea, Lienteria, or Dyſenteria, which ſoeuer it be of theſe, if it proceed of a maligne, and putride humour, it muſt not be ſuddainly ſtopped by aſtringent medicines, leaſt it happen vnto the woman with child, as it did vnto Smyrnia,
                        A wotrhy ſtorie. (as Hippocrat. ſaith) who hauing a fluxe of the belly, ſuddainly ſtopt; was deliuered in the the fourth moneth.
                     
                        How to proceed therein.Now to know what kind of fluxe it may be, the ſtooles will ſhew and teſtifie. If it be not violent, it may be ſuffered to flow gently, and for a good while; not omitting in the meane time, the vſe of ſome Clyſters, that may aſſwage the paine, if there be any. But if it continue, &amp; that it bee bred of ſome ſharpe and biting humours which knaw the guts, and prouoke the expulſiue facultie; (of which kind are fretting and biting choller, or ſalt flegme) and that the Mother ſeeme to grow weake and faint: then muſt it be remedied with as much ſpeed and care as may be: otherwiſe the woman hauing diuers

pangs, and prouocations, is in danger to be deliuered. Wherefore the humour offending muſt be purged with Rubarb, compound ſirup of Cichorie, and the like, which haue been alreadie preſcribed in the former Chapters: as alſo the like humours hindred from breeding.Her Diet. And therefore ſhe muſt abſtaine from all vnholſome meats, eſpecially if the cauſe thereof proceed from thence. Beſides, the ſaid humors muſt be allaied and made more gentle, that they may not any more prouoke or ſtir vp the expulſſiue vertue: the which may be eaſily done by a good dyet, which ſhall breed as little choller, or other bad humours, as may be: vſing broths made with Purcelance, Sorrell, Bugloſſe, and the cold ſeeds, adding thereto a little Riſe, or French Barley. The vſe of new laid Egges is much commended, which muſt be poched in water: Her meat muſt be rather roſt, then boiled: All ſpices are to be eſchewed. Let her drinke be red Wine, or ſteeled water, wherein a piece of bread hath been ſoked.
                     This drinke is verie fit, and pleaſant.
                     Take of French Barly, dried in a pan, a handfull,A Drinke. Fennill-ſeed, Coriander-ſeed, and Licoriſe of each, two drams, boile them in a quart of water, adding thereto an ounce of Berberis, or two ounces of the iuice of Pomgranats. A little before meales let her eat a ſlice of Marmilade.
                     And ſeeing there often happens paine and gripings together with pangs and throwes, becauſe the guts are moued and prouoked: therefore they

muſt be waſhed, and the paine mitigated with this Clyſter.

                     Of the ſwelling of the legs and thighs which happeneth vnto women with child. CHAP. XVII.
                     
                     
                        IN thoſe women which were woont to haue great quantitie of naturall purgations, before they were with child; the bloud after they haue conceiued, which was vſed to flow, beeing ſtopt and ſuppreſſed, and not being conuerted into nouriſhment by

the Mother,Cauſe of the ſwelling of the face. and much leſſe by the child; moſt commonly though it doth not breede the former accidents, yet is it altered, and conuerted into wateriſh humors: Moreouer the liuer through the aboundance of bloud, wherwith it doth ouerflow, breeds a ſerous or wateriſh bloud: and beeing not able to digeſt it, it is thruſt downward by the expulſiue vertue of the vpper parts, and at length reſts itſelfe vpon the legges, feet, and thighs, the which makes them all ſwelled and oedematous. This ſwelling oftentimes doth continue both day and night, and ſomtimes it is ſo reſolued in the night that in the morning it is ſcarce perceiued at all but preſently al the day, the tumor is renewed, &amp; at the euening doth much appeare: and then againe, in the night it is reſolued through reſt, and the heat of the bed. Such as are much ſubiect to the whites, before their being with child are commonly troubled with this infirmity, which was obſerued by Hippocrates in chollericke people, and thoſe that abound with ſerous, ſharpe,Who are not ſubiect to the ſwelling. and biting humors. Beſide the ſaid oedematous ſwelling, there happens an inflammation, which doth cauſe the skinne to go off, and ſomtime breedeth filthy vlcers. But this muſt bee remedied before theſe vlcers happen.
                     Theſe accidents continue commonly but the firſt foure moneths, yet with ſome they ſtay till their lying in, and ſo ſoon as they are deliuered, the ſwelling vaniſheth of it ſelfe.
                     If this diſeaſe doe not much offend the woman with child, it ſhall not be needfull to vſe many medicines,

but it is ſufficient that ſhe keep a good dyet, and chiefly if it reſolue of it ſelfe in the night. But if ſhe be much troubled therewithall,Aduertiſement concerning the cure. let her vſe theſe remedies.
                     Let the ſwollen parts be rubbed with this medicine.

                     I haue likewiſe vſed in ſteed of the foreſaid fomentation, before the applying of the Pulteſſe, to take a quantitie of Danewort,A tried remedie. a little Sage, with a few Chamomile and Melilot flowers, and heat them in a skillet, laying it round about the leg, and couering it quite with tyles which couer the tops of houſes, being a little heated, to keepe the hearbs gently warme the ſpace of an howre or two.
                     Some vſe Snayles with their ſhels beaten together, and applie them like a pulteſſe.
                     Beſide the former ſwelling of the legs, and feet, there hapneth to ſome a puffing vp, or windy ſwelling in the entrance of the wombe, ſo great, and ſwollen; that I haue ſeen it in ſome women, bigger then halfe a childs head: which doth ſo grieue, and trouble them, that they are ſcarſe able to bring their legs together, but are faine to ſtand ſtradling: This ſwelling is verie cleare, and ſhining; and to ſay the truth, there is nothing but water contained within it, the which muſt be cured before her lying in.An obſeruation. There are not any Cataplaſmes, or the like, in this caſe that can do much good: (as I my ſelfe haue oft made triall) But onely the manuall practize, making many long and deep ſcarifications of all ſides, which will cauſe great ſtore of water to flow, and iſſue from the part: the which I haue practized vpon many. And it is to be noted, that oftentimes this tumor doth returne, and is fill'd

againe, therefore it will be neceſſarie to make new ſcarifications. And to the end that it may not come ſo ſoone againe, applie thereto,A tried remedie. both within and without, fine lint moiſtned in the oyle of ſweet Almonds, and laying vpon it an emplaſter made with a little Cerotum infrigidans Galeni, &amp; Deſiccatiuum rubrum, mingled together: this medicine will make the orifices vent and flow the longer. Not long ſince, there were two worthy Ladies (which for honor ſake I will not name) that were troubled with this accident, about the time of their lying in; in whom I opened, and ſcarified thoſe parts, to make the water flow and come foorth. And it is to be obſerued, that we muſt awaite a fit opportunitie to do this; which will be when they are neare their lying downe.
                  
                  
                     The meanes to helpe women which cannot beare their Children the full time. CHAP. XVIII.
                     
                     
                        OFtentimes it happens to women, that they cannot beare their burthen to the time prefixed by nature, which is the ninth moneth. This accident is called either a ſhift, or ſlipping away, or elſe Abortment, or (as our women call it) a miſchance: The ſhift is reckoned from the firſt day the ſeed is retained in the wombe, till ſuch time as it receiueth forme and ſhape, in which time, if it chance to iſſue and flow

foorth, it is a Shift. The Abortment hapneth after the fortieth day, yea, euen to the end of the ninth moneth. For the Abortment is a violent expulſion, or excluſion of the child already formed and endued with life, before the appointed time. But the ſliding away, or ſhift, is a flowing or iſſuing of the ſeed, out of the wombe, which is not yet, either form'd, or endued with life.
                     Thoſe that haue been deliuered once before their time, for the moſt part they miſcarie with the reſt of their children, about the ſame time.
                     
                        Cauſes of Abortment.This accident may happen vpon diuers occaſions, the which are either inward, or outward. The outward are, either an Ague, fluxe of bloud, or of the belly, vomiting, or any other ſickneſſe that may happen vnto a woman with child; as alſo leaping, daunſing, riding in a Coach, too much ſtretching of her ſelfe, and the lifting, or carrying of any heauie burthen: the immoderate vſe of Venus, Paſsions of the mind, as choller, ſadneſſe, longing after any thing; or the vſe of violent and ſtrong medicines.
                     The inward cauſes are gathered from one of theſe three: either from the Mother, or things belonging to her,Cauſes from the child. or from the child. Thoſe that are taken from the child, are, when he is either ſo weak and ſickly, that he cannot be kept in the wombe, being not able to draw ſufficient nouriſhment, and thereby doth decay and die: or elſe by being too big and large; ſo that the wombe is not capable to lodge and ſupport him: which maketh the veſſels

of the wombe to bee relaxed and breake: then the entrance of the womb dilates it ſelfe, and the child commeth forth.
                     From the mother: when ſhee is eyther too ſmall,Cauſes from the mother. or low of ſtature, which cauſeth that the child cannot grow in ſo little roome neither moue himſelfe or breath (although he breath onely by the arteries of the mother) her breaſt beeing ſo ſtraight that it cannot be ſtretched or inlarged: or elſe becauſe ſhe is too fat, which maketh the caule to preſſe downe, and cruſh the Matrice, and cauſeth the ſeed to flow and iſſue forth before it be formed.Leannes cauſeth Abortment. A woman alſo that is too leane, and doth eate but little, ſeldome or neuer beares her child the full time. For if the mother be not well nouriſhed, much leſſe can the child. Too much eating ſtifles the child: as likewiſe the vſe of vnholeſome meates doth engender ill bloud in the mother: wherewith the childe beeing nouriſht, in the ende languiſheth, whence followeth death. Another cauſe may bee the ouermuch fulneſſe, and moiſtnes wherewith women abound,Fulneſſe is cauſe of Abortment. and chiefly in their womb, which oftentimes is ful, and ouerflowes with moſture, and filleth the veſſels of the wombe full of ſlime, whereby the inner orifice is inlarged, and dilated, vnable to ſupport, or keepe in the child. There may likewiſe bee ingendred ſome ſharpe, and biting humors; wherwith the Matrice beeing ſtirred, or prouoked, while it endeuours to expell them, may thruſt out the child alſo.
                     This accident may alſo happen to thoſe that in

their child bearing are ſubiect to haue their naturall courſes,They which haue their naturall courſes do often miſcarry. as if they were not with child: which commeth to paſſe, when nature ſtriuing to put them forth, doth cauſe the child to be vntyed, and ſo he followeth the Purgings.
                     
                        Things annexed to the mother which doe cauſe abortment.Concerning thoſe things which are annexed or belonging to the mother, I vnderſtand them to bee ſuch as may bee growne or contained within the womb, as ſome impoſtume, Scyrrhus, or excreſcēce of fleſh, mole or falſe conception, therin contained, as alſo great ſtore of water, the which I ſaw, not long ſince happen vnto an honeſt Gentlewoman, whoſe womb was ſo full of water in the eight moneth that the Orifice thereof was conſtrained to open it ſelfe, and let them foorth, the which was in ſuch quantity, that it is incredible to bee reported, and ſome ſixe daies after, ſhee was deliuered, the wombe not being cloſed againe.
                     As this accident is very dangerous, both for the mother and the child; ſo will it bee needfull to preuent, and remedy it with all ſpeed poſſible.
                     
                        Signes of abortment.Firſt we may know, that a woman is in danger to abort, or miſcarry, when the milk in her breſts doth flow and run forth in great quantity, her breſts remaining limber and ſoft: and if ſhe be with child of two children, and one breſt grow empty, it is ſigne ſhe wil miſcary with one of them. For this ſheweth that the child doth loath &amp; refuſe his nouriſhment: chiefly if the nipple haue gotten any ill colour, it is a ſigne that the Matrice is diſtempered according to Hyppocrates.

                        They that are troubled with a great looſeneſſe of the belly, bee often deliuered before their time.Looſenes of the belly cauſeth abortment.
                     
                     Likewiſe great paine of the backe, and thighs, which coms round to the groin, and bottome of the belly, doth oftentimes preſage the like. As alſo when there floweth out of the conduit of nature, firſt certain waters, then bloudy and ſlimy matter, and laſt of all bloud.
                     To the end that it may be ſafely remedied,Cure of Abortment. there muſt reſpect be had to the cauſe: Now concerning the outward cauſes, as if the mother bee troubled with any ſicknes ſhe muſt be handled as it is requiſite and fit: ſhee muſt ſhunne all violent exerciſes, paſſions of the mind, and the too often vſe of Venus. If the abortment proceed, from the littleneſſe or lownes of the mother, before her being with child, let her vſe Bathes, fomentations, and oyntments that may looſen and inlarge her belly, and Matrice. And while ſhe goeth with child let her feede moderately, to nouriſh her ſelfe, and her child, &amp; when the ninth month is come let her vſe ſupling and relaxing oyntments like thoſe formerly ſet downe.
                     If the cauſe be of too much fatnes, it wil be very fit and conuenient to purge her, and let her bloud, before ſhee bee with child; and to preſcribe her a ſtrict order of dyet thereby to make her leane, vſing meates that bee not too nouriſhing, or full of good iuice. Contrariwiſe ſhe that is too leane, muſt vſe good meates, and ſuch as breed good iuice, and that in good quantity. If too much eating and drinking, or the vſe of bad meates, that breed ill iuice,

be the cauſe: then muſt ſhe abſteine from them.
                     And when it doth proceed from the fulneſſe and aboundance of humors, &amp; water: as it happeneth in full bodied young women, or which before their being with child were ſubiect to ſome euacuations (as bleeding at the noſe, Hemorrodes, or abundance of ordinary purgations, and whites) then will it alſo be very needful to purge, and let them bloud and before their beeing with child, to make them vſe the dyet:When the diet is neceſſary and eſpecially thoſe, that haue the ligaments of the womb looſe and ſoft, and the veſſels full of thicke and ſlimy matter: to whome likewiſe may be adminiſtred cleanſing, &amp; ſtrengthening iniections, drying perfumes, Baths with ſulphur, and emplaſters for their backes, which ſhall heereafter be ſet downe.
                     
                        Bloudletting fit for them that abort.And when they ſhall be gone about foure moneths and a halfe, it will be very fit to purge them gently, &amp; let them bloud, the which may be done more plentifully and boldly (not all at once, but at ſundry times) in thoſe who before their being with child were vſed to more copious and frequent euacuations. For experience doth ſhew, that by this meanes, thoſe which were wont to be deliuered before their time, haue not onely born their children to the ordinary time, but thereby alſo haue beene brought a bed more eaſily, and with leſſe pain and trouble.Store of nouriſhment choketh the child. So that the child ſhall neither be in daunger to bee ſtifled, by drawing more food then is needfull for his nouriſhment; nor of growing too big, by turning it into his owne ſuſtenance, which

might bee a meanes through his exceeding greatneſſe to breake and teare the ligaments that ſupport him, or elſe, though he ſtay his ful time, (being thus big) that he ſhould not be able to come eaſily into the world.

                        Origen in his eleuenth Homely vpon Exodus ſpeaketh of two Midwiues, verie skilfull in Phyſicke, which were Aegyptians, and cals them Sephora and Phua.
                     
                     Beſide this curioſitie; neceſſitie, (the miſtreſſe of Arts) hath conſtrained women, to learne and practiſe Phyſicke, one with another. For finding themſelues afflicted, and troubled with diuers diſeaſes in their naturall parts, and being deſtitute of all remedies,Why women did ſtudie Phyſicke. (for want whereof many periſhed, and died miſerably) they durſt not diſcouer, and lay open their infirmities, to any but themſelues, accounting it to be diſhoneſt:
                           Higinus. Women forbid to ſtudie Phyſicke. As Higinus teſtifies, who relateth, how the Athenians had forbidden women, by their Lawes, to ſtudie in Phyſicke; and that at the ſame time there was a certaine maide named Agnodicea, verie deſirous to ſtudie therein, who the better to attaine vnto her purpoſe, did cut off her haire, and apparell her ſelfe like a man: and being ſo diſguiſed, ſhe became the ſcholler of Herophylus the Phyſition:A notable Hyſtorie. And when ſhe had learned Phyſicke, hauing notice of a certaine woman that was troubled in her naturall parts; ſhe went vnto her, and made proffer of her ſeruice; which the ſicke party refuſed, thinking ſhe had been a man: But when Agnodicea had aſſured her (by diſcouering of her ſelfe) that ſhe was a maide, the woman committed her ſelfe, into her hands, who dreſt, and cured her perfectly: and with the like care and induſtrie ſhe looked to many others, and cured them. Which being knowen by the Phyſitions, becauſe

they were not called any more to the cure of women, they accuſed the ſaid Agnodicea, that ſhe had ſhaued off her beard, that thereby ſhe might abuſe women, faining themſelues to be ſicke. Then ſhe putting aſide her garments, made it euident that ſhe was a maide: which cauſed the Phyſitions then to accuſe her of a greater fault, for tranſgreſſing the Law, which forbad women either to ſtudie or practize Phyſicke. This being come to the eares of the chiefeſt women, they preſently went to the chiefe Magiſtrates, and Iudges of the Citie, called the Areopagites, and told them: that they did not account them, for their husbands, and friends, but for enemies; that they would condemne her, which reſtor'd them to their health: which made the Atheniaens to reuoke and diſanull that Law, giuing Gentle-women leaue to ſtudie and practize Phyſicke.
                     Now ſince the greateſt diſeaſe that women can haue is that of the nine Moneths, the Criſis and cure whereof conſiſts in their ſafe deliuerie:There haue been Midwiues from the beginning. Lib. de Carnibus.
                         we muſt not doubt, but that there haue been ſome women addicted thereto, and practized therein, in all ages. Hippocrates ſpeaking of the birth that hapneth in the ſeuenth Moneth, doth refer the Reader vnto the Midwiues, who are preſent at ſuch labours, and wiſheth him to learne the truth thereof, of them.

                     But among thoſe that haue practized Phyſicke, there were ſome that haue applied themſelues moſt, to the deliuering of Women; and for a difference from others, they were commonly called Cunning women: or elſe cauſed themſelues to be ſo called: For women are of this diſpoſition, that they deſire to excell men, or at leaſt to ſeeme to go beyond them.

it is dilated and inlarged, to giue paſſage, and way for the child; the which cannot bee comprehended (as the ſame Galen ſaith) but only wondred at, and admired. The ſame Author in his fifteenth booke de vſu partium, deſirous to ſhew the prouidence of Nature ſaith, that the faults of Nature are very rare, and that ſhe worketh alwaies, and in ſuch order, and meaſure, that of a thouſand births, there is ſcarce one found that is amiſſe.
                     Wherefore neither the Midwife nor any of the Womans kinsfolkes, or aſsiſtants, ought to doe any thing raſhly, but ſuffer nature to worke; helping her notwithſtanding in that which ſhall bee needfull, as heereafter ſhall be declared: deuiding the worke of their deliuery into three ſeueral times and ſeaſons.

                        THe time of deliuery being at hand, the woman is to prepare her ſelfe in this manner. She muſt preſently ſend for the Midwife, and her keeper, it being better to haue them about her too ſoon, then too late; for there be ſome women that are deliuered ſodainely without the helpe of any one, although they haue beene long in their firſt labour.
                     
                        The beddeIn the meane time, ſhe muſt haue a little bedde

prouided her, like a pallet, which muſt bee of a reaſonable bignes, ſtrong and firme, and alſo of an indifferent height (as well for her owne commodity, as the Midwiues, and others that ſhal be preſent about her, to helpe her, in her labour) and it muſt be ſo ſet &amp; placed, that they may conueniently come and go round about her, it muſt be placed far from any doore, and ſomwhat neere the fire. Let it alſo be conueniently furniſhed with beds &amp; good ſtore of linnen that they may be often changed, as neede ſhall require. And likewiſe there muſt bee laid croſſe the beds feete, a peece of wood, for the woman to reſt her feete vpon, that ſo ſhe may haue the more ſtrength when ſhe bendeth her legs, as we will ſhew heereafter.
                     As ſoone as ſhe feeles her ſelfe ſtirred and prouoked with throwes and paines,Women in trauaile mu

Yet it may chance,Reſt is oft profitable that being in bed ſhee may take ſome reſt and haue a little ſlumber, and ſo by this meanes the mother may gather more ſtrength, &amp; the child be the better inabled to come at the time, which God hath appointed it, and alſo the waters will be the better prepared &amp; gathered.
                     
                        They may giue her, if the labour be long, a little broth, or the yelke of an egge with ſome butter, and bread, and alſo a little wine and water.
                     
                        Diuers ſorts of bringing womē to bed.It is very certaine, that all women are not deliuered after one faſhion: for ſome are deliuered in their bed; others ſitting in a chaire, ſome ſtanding being ſupported and held vp by the ſtanders by: or elſe leaning vpon the ſide of a bed, table or chaire; others kneeling being held vp by the armes. But the beſt and ſafeſt way,The beſt way to be deliuered. is; to be deliuered in their bed, (the which I aduiſe them to) the midwife, and aſſiſtants, as her kinsfolkes, friends, and keepers, obſeruing this that followes.
                     Firſt the woman muſt be laid flat vpon her back, hauing her head raiſed ſomwhat high,The placing of a woman in trauaile. with a pillow vnder her backe that it bow not: and vnder her buttocks and os ſacrum, let her haue another pretty big pillow, that thereby thoſe parts may bee ſomewhat lifted vp: for a woman that ſinketh down into the bed can neuer be well deliuered; and therefore the well placing of them is of great conſequence. Let her thighs and knees be ſtretcht forth and laide abroad one from another: and her legs bowed and drawn vpward, hauing her heels &amp; the ſoles of her feet, leaning hard againſt the peece of wood, which is laid croſſe the bedde for this purpoſe.
                     About ſome they put a ſwath foure times doubled vnder their backe, and hinder parts, which comes round about them: this ſwath muſt be a foot broad, &amp; better, and ſo long, that it may be held by two women, ſtanding on each ſide of the bed, there

with to lift vp the woman in trauaile a litle, pulling it gently towards them, &amp; chiefly when her throws come vpon her. For this raiſing or lifting vp doth much refreſh her, and makes her endure her throws with more eaſe.
                     Beſide the two women that hold the ſwath, there muſt be two more of her friends or kinſfolks,Another help for a woman in labour. to take her by the hands, thereby to clinſh or cruſh them when her throws come, and the other hand they muſt hold on the top of her ſhoulders, that ſhe riſe not vpward too much, and that ſhe may the better ſtraine her ſelfe, for oftentimes as ſhee thruſts her feete hard againſt the peece of wood, which is put croſſe the bed, ſhe raiſeth her ſelfe vpward. Sometime I haue bid one of the women that ſtand by to preſſe gently with the palme of her hand the vpper parts of the belly, ſtroking the child downward by little and little, the which preſſing did haſten the deliuery, and made them endure the throws better, and with more eaſe.
                     The woman in trauaile being thus placed, muſt take a good heart, and ſtraine her ſelfe as much as ſhe can, when her throws come vpon her, making them double and increaſe, by holding in her breath and ſtopping her mouth, and forming her ſelfe, as though ſhe would go to the ſtoole, which is much fitter for her to doe then to lye crying and lamenting.
                     
                        Ariſtotle hath well obſerued, that thoſe women,

                         which draw their breath vpward, are deliuered with much paine, becauſe they make the Midrife

riſe vp, which in this buſineſſe, ſhould rather be depreſſed, and kept downe. It is very fit indeede, that ſhe take ſome eaſe and reſpite, not forcing her ſelfe much for euery little pang that happens, which ſhe may gather all into one, thereby to make them auaileable; when time ſhall ſerue.
                     
                        
                           Actites.
                        If ſhe weare about her necke an Eagles ſtone, loadſtone, the skinne of an Vrus or wild Oxe or the like, which might keepe backe the child, let them be taken away, and tied to her thighs.
                     But aboue all things ſhe muſt be obedient to all that is commanded her, either by her kinsfolks, and friends, or by the Midwife. Likewiſe ſhe muſt be patient in her ſickneſſe, calling vppon God for helpe, ſince it concernes both her own life, and the childs, and ſhee muſt call to mind, that hee hath ſaid with his owne mouth,
                           Genes.
                         
                        That the woman ſhould bring forth with labour and paine. For it would bee a rare thing to ſee a woman deliuered without any paine. Medea in Euripides ſaith,
                           Euripides.

                     Neuertheleſſe we read in hiſtories, of a certaine Country wherein women are deliuered without any paine. And Ariſtotle in his wonderfull Narrations reporteth,Women deliuered without paine. that the women of Ligustria doe bring forth without paine, and that they returne to their buſineſſe as ſoone as they are deliuered.
                     They that write the Hiſtory of America doe tell the like, of the women in that country, which is; That as ſoone as they be deliuered, (they are ſo kind to their husbands, which tooke the paines to beget

the child) that they preſently riſe vp and lay their husbands in their roome;Men that lye in. who are vſed and attended, like women in childbed. And in this manner they be viſited of all their friends, and kinsfolk, who bring them gifts and preſents.

And for the more aſſurance, let the Midwife thruſt vp her hand, being firſt annointed, either with freſh butter, hogs greaſe, or ſome other ointment, which heere after ſhall be ſet downe. And if ſhe perceiue that both the inner, and outward orifice of the wombe, be dilated and opened, it is a ſigne ſhe begins to be in trauail, eſpecially if there flow or come forth by the ſaid paſſage, any ſlime, or water: the which doe foreſhew, that the birth is at hand, as Hippocrat. ſaith, which if they be pale, it ſignifies for the moſt part, it will be a wench: and if it be reddiſh that it is a ſonne. Now this ſlime commeth by the dilatation of the inner orifice, and from the membrane, that doth wrap and infold the child, which begins to breake. And alſo by reaſon of the veſſels, and tyes which are looſened from the ſides of the wombe the which may be perceiued by the waters which will ſwell, ſhewing like a bubble, or rather like a bladder full of water. And when the water begins to be thus gathered, there is no doubt to be made, but that the woman is in trauail: Hippocrates doth obſerue three ſorts of humors, that flow in the time of their trauaile: the firſt, is ſlimy: the ſecond reddiſh: the third is the water wherein the child ſwimmeth, and heere endeth the firſt time, which the midwife muſt oberue.

And by this meanes, ſhe may know,The mean

                            the child commeth. whether the child come naturally, or no, for in feeling gently croſſe the membrane, that containes the waters, ſhe ſhall find, either the roundneſſe of the childs head, or elſe ſome vneuenneſſe. If in feeling, ſhe perceiue that there is any hard and equall roundneſſe; it is moſt likely to be the childs head▪ and that he comes naturally: but if ſhe feele any vneuenneſſe, the contrarie may be imagined.
                     When ſhe perceiueth, that all comes well, and according to nature, the throwes increaſing vpon the woman, and that the child doth ſtriue and endeuour to come forth, and the wombe doth ſtraine it ſelfe to be freed of this burthen; Then the Midwife muſt incourage the woman, entreating her to hold in her breath, by ſtopping her mouth, and to ſtraine downward, as though ſhe would go to the ſtoole: Aſſuring her, that ſhe ſhall be quickly eaſed

of her paine: and that her child is euen ready to come into the world, exhorting her to be patient, and promiſing, that ſhe ſhall haue, either a goodly ſonne, or a faire daughter, according as ſhe knoweth her affection inclined.
                     And the Midwiues greateſt charge muſt be, that ſhe doe nothing haſtily, or raſhly, or by force, to inlarge the paſſage of the child: and much leſſe, to let foorth the water, or to breake, and teare the membranes, that containe it: but ſhe muſt expect till it breake of it ſelfe.
                     
                        The water muſt not be let foorth.Some Midwiues either through ignorance, or impatience, or elſe by being haſtned to go to ſome other womans labour, do teare the membranes with their nayles, and let foorth the water, to the great hurt and danger, both of the poore woman, and her child: who remaines drie, the water being iſſued, and voided before the appointed time; yea, oftentimes before the child be well turned, which hath been the death of many women, and children. But when the water, both by the indeuour of the Mother, and likewiſe of the child, ſhall be newly broken; then aſwell the Midwife, as the reſt of the women preſent, muſt more and more incourage the woman, eſpecially when her throwes increaſe; beſeeching her in the name of God, that ſhe would farther them, as much as ſhe can poſſibly. In the meane time, the Midwife muſt continually annoint the neather parts with butter, or ſome other fats. And when the head doth offer it ſelfe to come foorth, ſhe muſt receiue it gently

with both her hands: which being come ſoorth, and the womans throwes increaſing, ſhe muſt draw out the ſhoulders handſomely, ſliding downe her finger vnder the childs arme-pits; taking the oportunitie and time when her throwes come faſteſt. And it is to be noted, that the throwes ceaſe verie little, or not at all, after the head and ſhoulders be once come forth: Neuertheleſſe, it will be very fit, to giue the poore woman a little breathing, intreating her, that ſhe would be of as good cheare as ſhe can. After this, the Midwife hauing drawen out the ſhoulders, may eaſily draw forth the reſt of the body: which muſt not be done either haſtily or raſhly.
                     But becauſe the child naturally doth come into the world, with the face downward: therefore when he is quite taken foorth, he muſt be turned vpon his backe: for feare leſt hee be ſtifled, or chok't.The Nauell ſtring muſt be vndone. And if his nauell-ſtring be woond about his necke, (as many times it happens) then muſt it be vnwoond. Oftentimes likewiſe, the child is ſo feeble, and faint, that there can ſcarſely be perceiued any breath, or life in him: and therefore he muſt haue a little wine ſpirted into his mouth, noſe, and eares, in that quantitie as ſhall be needfull. When he is come to himſelfe, and begins to crie, then the Midwife muſt follow the ſtring, wagging and ſhaking it, thereby to draw, and bring foorth gently the after-birth, to which it is tyed:Meanes to draw forth the after-burthen. bidding the woman to cough, and likewiſe to hold ſome ſalt in her hands, faſt ſhut together, and then blow in them.
                     
                        In the meane time the Midwife, or ſome other woman, muſt preſſe gently with her hand, the top of the womans belly, ſtroking it lightly downward: the after-burthen being come, it muſt be laid vpon the childs belly:What muſt be done to the child. and the child, together with the after-birth, muſt be wrapp'd vp handſomely in a bed, and a blanket, to be carried nearer the fire, couering the head with a linnen cloth fiue or ſixe times double: and yet not expoſing him ſodainly either to the fire-light, day-light, or candle-light, leſt by this ſodaine change his ſight might be hurt: but his eies muſt be couered, that by little and little he may open them, and acquaint them with the light.
                     But as I ſaid before, the woman muſt be incouraged when the water doth iſſue foorth, and cauſed to ſtraine her ſelfe to be deliuered, that the child may follow the foreſaid water.
                     And they muſt likewiſe obſerue diligently, whether the paines, be the paines of trauaile, or no: and whether the water be that, wherein the child ſwimmeth. For there be ſome women that haue theſe waters iſſue out, and come away, long before they are ready to lie downe. Which I haue ſeen happen vnto diuers women, and of late memorie to Mad. Arnault,
                        A notable ſtorie. who hauing gone ſixe or ſeuen moneths, and troubled with a great Colique, that had held her almoſt two moneths, and tooke her euery day at certaine howres: She being at her houſe in the Countrey, intreated me that I would come and ſee her, and to haue

my aduiſe and counſell, whether it were fit for her to come into the Citie; which I adiuſed her to do: both becauſe of the great paines ſhe had, as alſo for her exceeding greatneſſe: being of opinion, that ſhe might haue two children, as ſhe had had, not aboue a yeare before. Being come to Paris, her Colique was ſomewhat mitigated, and a little while after ſhe voided two or three gallons of water, without any paine, thinking verily then, that ſhe was not with child: yet fiue daies after ſhe was deliuered very happily, and with little paine, of a faire daughter, there following very little water, or none at all.
                     I ſaw another Ladie in whom theſe waters came away, aboue ten daies before her deliuerie, yet ſhe kept not her bed, but followed her ordinarie buſineſſe. And this is worth marking, that they may be carefull not to haſten the deliuerie; except the paines be proper for trauaile, and ſuch as I haue already deſcribed.

                        AS ſoone as the child is borne, and that the Mother is deliuered of her after-birth, the Midwife ſhall cauſe her legs to be gently laid downe, taking away the peece of wood, that lay at her feet: and put a fine linnen cloth, or rather

a cleane ſpunge, waſhed in warme water, and wrung out, betweene her thigh's, neare vnto her naturall parts, that the cold ayre may not get therein: and then muſt ſhe take the child, together with the after-burthen, and carrie them to the fire, as hath been ſaid already.
                     And if it happen, that the after-burthen be long ere it come, or be drawen foorth; and that the child may not ſtay ſo long there, for danger to be ſtifled, and die, it being oftentimes verie weake. The midwife ſhall firſt tye, and then cut the childs Nauel-ſtring, to ſeperat him from the after-burthen: Which muſt be done in this manner.
                     
                        How the Nauell muſt be tyed.She muſt haue in readyneſſe, a good double thread, and a paire of ſharpe Sciſſors: with the thread ſhe muſt tye the Nauell a good inch from the childs belly with a double knot, or oftner: this knot muſt be neither too hard and ſtraite, neither too looſe: for too ſtraite tying, beſide the extreame paine it cauſeth, makes that which is tyed fall off too ſoone, and that, before the ſcar be growen betweene the liue and the dead part: And if it be tyed too looſe, thereof proceeds a fluxe of bloud from the vmbilicall veſſels, which are not exactly cloſed and ſtopp't by the ſaid ligature: and therefore, a meane muſt be obſerued in doing it. Then being thus tyed,Where the Nauell muſt be cut. the Nauel-ſtring muſt be cut off an inch beneath the knot; And that the knot may not ſlip, nor the thred ſlide away, ſhe muſt take a little fine linnen rowler dip't in oile of Roſes, wherewith ſhe muſt wrap the reſt of the Nauell, and

with a little fine bumbaſt moiſtned in the ſame oyle, ſhe muſt lay it vpon the belly, that it be not cruſht, when they dreſſe and ſwath the child. By this ligature,The Nauell muſt fall of it ſelfe. that which is tyed will come to wither, and drie of it ſelfe, and ſome foure or fiue daies after, more, or leſſe, the dead part will fall from the quicke, which muſt not be forc'd or pluckt off in any caſe.
                     Some do obſerue, that the Nauell muſt be tyed longer, or ſhorter, according to the difference of the ſexe, allowing more meaſure to the males:The meaſure in tying the Nauell. becauſe this length doth make their tongue, and priuie membres the longer: whereby they may both ſpeake the plainer, and be more ſeruiceable to Ladies. And that by tying it ſhort, and almoſt cloſe to the belly in females, their tongue is leſſe free, and their naturall part more ſtraite: And to ſpeake the truth,A common ſaying of Women. the Goſſips commonly ſay merrily to the Midwife; if it be a boy, Make him good meaſure; but if it be a wench, Tye it ſhort.
                     
                     
                        Hippocrates would haue them, in tying the Nauell, obſerue this that followeth.Precept of Hippocrates.
                         If a woman (ſaith he) be deliuered with paine, and the child ſtay long in the wombe, and comes not foorth eaſily, but with trouble: and chiefly if it be by the Chirurgians help, and inſtruments: ſuch children are not long liued, and therefore there Nauell-ſtring muſt not be cut, before they haue either ſneez'd, piſs'd, or cried.
                     Anone after the Midwife hath cut the Nauell, ſhe muſt wipe and make clean the child, not onely

his face, but his whole bodie, and the wrinkles and folds of the arme-pits, buttocks, and ioints, either with freſh Butter, or oyle of ſweet Almonds. Some do it with oyle of Roſes, others with oyle of Nuts, thereby to make the skin more firme, and to ſtop the pores, that the outward ayre may not hurt him, and likewiſe to ſtrengthen all his parts.
                     
                        
                           Auicens Method.
                        Auicen boyleth Roſes and Sage in wine, and waſheth the child with a fine ſoft Spung dipt therein: and ſo continues it three or foure mornings when he is ſhifted.
                     The child being thus ſhifted and annoynted, and then well dried, and wrap't vp by the Midwife, or others:What muſt be giuen the child after he is borne. they muſt preſently giue him a little wine and Suger in a ſpoone, or elſe the bigneſſe of a peaſe, of Mithridate, or Triacle, diſſolued in a little wine, if it be Winter, and in Summer (by reaſon of the heat) with a little Carduus Benedictus, or ſome other Cordiall water.
                     
                     
                        Auicen doth thinke it ſufficient to giue them a little Hony: and to rub the top and bottome of the tongue with ones finger dip't in hony. And by this meanes, to ſee whether they be tongue tyed, and ſo to cut the ſtring, if it be needfull.
                  
                  
                     
                     of the Care that muſt be had of a Woman in Child bed. CHAP. VII.
                     
                     
                        WHile the Midwife doth cut the childs Nauell, and make him cleane, the Nurſe, or ſome other that is preſent, muſt haue an eſpeciall Care of two things: The firſt is, To giue the woman in child-bed this drinke.

                           
                              A Drinke for a woman in child-bed. Take oyle of ſweet Almonds newly drawen, two ounces, Syrup of Maidenhayre, one ounce, white Wine, water of Parietarie of the wall, and Carduus Benedictus, of each halfe an ounce,
                        
Mingle them verie well together with much ſhaking, and ſo let her drinke it. This medicine will mitigate and lenifie the paſſage of the throat, and Trachaea Arteria, which haue been heated, and ſtretched with crying, and groning: And likewiſe it will help to prouoke the purgings, and hinder the pangs and gripings from being ſo violent.
                     2. The ſecond is, to cauſe a ſheep to be fleaed, and to wrap the womans backe and belly in the skin yet warme, thereby to ſtrengthen and comfort, all thoſe parts, which haue been as it were diſiointed, and pull'd one from another, with much ſtriuing in her trauaile. Auicen thinks it enough to lay vpon the womans belly, a Hares skin newly ſtript from the Hare being aliue.
                     
                        Then the Midwife (if ſhe be not buſied about the Child) or ſome other that looketh to the woman, ſhall applie beneath to the entrance of the naturall part, and about the bottome of her belly this medicine.
                     
                        
                           A ſtrengthening Medicine. Take oyle of Hypericum, Saint Iohns Wart, two ounces, Oyle of Roſes, an ounce: Two whole egges,
Mingle them well together and let them be applied as I ſhewd before with finelinnen clothes, or flaxe, likewiſe there muſt be laid vnder her hams, a little pillow doubled, to make her keepe her knees vp a little, and that her thighs &amp; legs lie not ſtraight down. Let her neither lye along, nor ſit vpright but keepe her ſelfe betweene both, hauing her heade and body rather a little raiſed, then laidlow, that her purgings may the eaſier come away.
                     
                     After the skinne hath layen there two or three daies, the Midwife, or her nurſe ſhall take it away, and ſwath her belly, rubbing and anointing it firſt, with oile of Saint Iohns wort, ſweet Almonds, and Roſes, mingled together. For this ſwathing ſerues to keepe the Matrice in his place, and to driue downe gently her after-purgings, and alſo is a meanes to keepe out the aire, which otherwiſe might cauſe the woman to haue great paines and gripings.
                     
                        The faſhion of the ſwath. The ſwath muſt bee made of linnen cloth foure times doubled, of the bredth of all ber belly; which muſt be put round about her backe &amp; belly ſmooth without any pleat and wrinkle. And while they be about this, they muſt take an eſpecial care, that the

woman catch not cold, nor that the aire get not into her wombe, which being emptied of ſuch a burthen, will eaſily receiue it,They muſt beware of taking cold. and this might bee a meanes to make it ſwell, and puffe vp, and to ſhut the orifices of the veines, by which her purgings ſhould flow: the ſuppreſſion whereof doth cauſe paines, gripings, ſuffocation, an ague, and many other accidents.
                     Now when the woman ſhall be thus accommodated, ſhe muſt be kept from ſleeping, though ſhee bee very deſirous thereof, and let her in the meane time be entertained with ſome diſcourſe, and let her nurſe looke to her breſts, applying ſuch things thereunto, as ſhall be ſet downe in the third booke in their proper place.
                     After the woman hath beene kept three or foure houres from ſleeping, you may giue her ſome broth made with a knuckle of Veale, or a Chicken,The woman in child bed muſt bee in quiet. or in ſtead thereof, a couple of yelkes of egges, and ſo let her take her reſt: and if ſhe haue any deſire to ſleep, ſhee may, which muſt bee ſome three or foure houres after her deliuery, the dores and windowes of her chamber, being cloſe ſhut, not making any noiſe.
                     And ſo let this ſuffice, for the naturall trauaile or deliuery; wherein there hath beene no difficulty: the woman beeing neither much troubled,
                           Gen. 3.15. nor hauing had any greate paines, but thoſe that are ordinary, and ſuch as God hath, which is, that In ſorrow a woman ſhould bring forth.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     Of a painfull, and difficult deliuery with the cauſes thereof. CHAP. VIII.
                     
                     
                        WOmen are brough a bed very hardly, and with much paine, vppon diuers reaſons, which is an occaſion that many repaire vnto Phiſitians, and Chirurgions, to haue their helpe, ſince there be few Midwiues found skilful, that can giue them much aide or ſuccour in theſe caſes.
                     
                        Cauſes of difficult deliueryA Chirurgion beeing called thither, ought diligently to inquire, what may be the cauſe, and conſider carefully thereof: now the cauſe may be referred to foure things, either to the mother: or to the child: or to things that are annexed vnto the child: or elſe to outward things, and ſo accordingly muſt they frame the remedy.
                     
                        Cauſe from outward things.In the number of outward things I comprehend thoſe perſons, that are about the woman in trauail, who if they be diſpleaſing vnto her, are to be intreted gently to withdraw and abſent themſelues. Whether it be by reaſon that the woman hath any feare, apprehenſion, or any miſlike and loathing vnwillling to haue them ſo neare her, when ſhee is in her trauaile, and anguiſh; or elſe being aſhamed to ſee her ſelfe in that caſe.
                     
                        
                           Lib. 28. cap. 6.2 Pliny writeth that the ancients held an opinion that the deliuery might bee hindred and prooue

difficult:Opinion of Plyny. Story of Alcmena.
                         if there were any in the womans chamber, which held her fingers lockt, or ſhut one within another: and produceth for an example Alcmena; who could not be deliuered of Hercules, but with much difficulty.
                     3 Likewiſe the outward aire being too cold, may hinder the deliuery becauſe it cooleth the woman,Coldnes or heate doth hinder the deliuery. ſhutting vp her body, and eſpecially thoſe parts, which ought to be inlarged, and dilated. As alſo the aire being too hot, ſpendeth the ſpirits, and makes the woman loſe her ſtrength, remaining weake and feeble, and as it were fainting, without any power, or courage. And therefore the aire muſt be temperate, yet rather hot, then cold.
                     4 Pleaſing ſmels, (as of Muske, Ciuet,Effect of ſweet ſmels. Amber Griſe, or the like, if ſhe haue ſuch about her, the vapour whereof, may ſtrike vp into her noſe,) doe hinder the deliuery: becauſe they draw the wombe vpward.
                     If the cauſe of difficult deliuery be in the mother her ſelfe, it comes, either by reaſon of her perſon,Cauſes from the Mother or her age, or her naturall diſpoſition, or of ſome other accident ſhe hath had or may haue: or by being deliuered before, or after her time.
                     1 Her perſon or body may be the cauſe thereof: as if ſhee be too fat and full: for in ſuch women I haue ſeene great ſtore of fat come down into their naturall parts, which ſtopped the paſſage.Fatneſ

                         And in others I haue ſeene the caule come downe, which did ſo preſſe, and cruſh together both the inward and outward necke of the wombe, that it could very

hardly open it ſelfe, yea, and being dilated, and inlarged, did euen cloſe &amp; preſſe it together againe.
                     In ſome I haue ſeene and felt part of the bladder preſent it ſelfe at the entrance of the wombe.The Bladder.
                     
                     A woman that is too leane and bare: as alſo one that is too little,Leaneneſſe. may likewiſe bee deliuered with much difficulty. And when this happeneth, it cannot be remedied, as one would deſire.
                     2 Now concerning their age: both they that are too yoong as being too ſtraight: and alſo they that are old, hauing alſo their naturall parts too much ſhrunke together and dryed, and the bones too cloſely ioyned together, &amp; the cartilages very hard which cannot ſo well yeeld, and bee dilated, as in youth; I ſay both of theſe bee deliuered with very much difficulty.
                     
                        From her diſpoſition.3 Their naturall diſpoſition likewiſe may bee a cauſe that they are deliuered with much paine.
                     1 As if they be weake of conſtitution, nice, tender, timerous, and afraid of paine: which makes them, that they will not force themſelues, nor make their paines and throws effectuall: and when the child is euen ready to come forth, they ſhrinke in themſelues, with the very feare they haue to feel ſuch paine.
                     2 Hippocrates ſaith that women, which haue an Ague when they are with child,
                           Hippocrates.
                         and become very leane without a manifeſt cauſe, doe bring foorth their children with great difficulty, paine, and danger: And if they doe miſcarry or abort, then they are in danger of their liues. The ſame Author ſaith,

that thoſe women which giue but little nouriſhment to their children, are ſooner deliuered,
                           Lib. de natura pueri.
                         and contrariwiſe they that feede too much, are longer ere they be brought a bed.
                     3 They that haue beene troubled with any ſickneſſes; as the bloudy fluxe or other fluxe of the belly, Convulſions, fluxe of bloud: or that haue any tumor, vlcer, or ſcarre which hath happened by being heeretofore badly deliuered; or any other accident that hath made the necke of the wombe hard, cloſe and ſtraight, which is a meanes that it cannot be dilated, and inlarged, or elſe which haue the entrance, or paſſage ſtopt with ſome fleſh or membrane, that is naturall vnto them: that is to ſay which they haue had from their birth: All theſe (I ſay) are deliuered with great paine, and difficulty, yea and oftentimes doe loſe their liues thereby.
                     Now ſome will thinke it very ſtrange, and almoſt incredible, to find a woman that ſhould bee with child, and yet a maide,A thing worthy to bee obſerued. there being euen from her birth a membrane that ſtoppeth the paſſage, and hindreth the man from entring. Where as it is neceſſary for conception, that a woman ſhould haue the entire fruition or company of the man, and that he ſhould not onely enter within the outward paſſage of the womb, but euen to the inner necke therof, to carry thether the ſeed, and there to mingle it with the womans. But ſtories in this kinde make vs beleeue the contrary; ſeeing there is no ſuch neceſſity that the mans ſeede ſhould be carried, and caſt ſo deepe. For in ſome Women the wombe is ſo

greedy, and lickeriſh that it doth euen come down to meet nature, ſucking, and (as it were) ſnatching the ſame, though it remaine only about the mouth and entrance of the outward orifice thereof.

                        A true ſtory.The yeare 1607. in May, Maſter de la Noue the Kings Chirurgion in Ordinary, and ſworne in the Chaſtelet of Paris, was called to ſearch a yong Woman the wife of a Gold-ſmith, who had beene cited by her Husband to appeare before the Officiall of Paris: alleadging, that ſhe was not capable nor fit by nature, to be married: which was an occaſion that Germane Haſſart a Midwife, and my ſelfe were ſent for to ſearch her. Where wee found, that in the very entrance of the wombe, there was a membrane ſo ſtrong, hard, and thicke, that a mans finger, (and much leſſe the other part) was not able to breake it open; he hauing oftentimes made triall to doe it, whereby he had incurred a Paraphimoſis: And therefore it was concluded, that her husband had a iuſt cauſe to cite her, but yet for all this, that it was curable.
                     Whereupon her Husband thought good to call Maſter de Levrye, and Pietre, ſworne Chirurgians at Paris: then we all there concluded with a generall conſent, to make an inciſion, of the ſaid Membrane, which was done; and dreſſed and healed, to her Husbands content: onely he was ſomwhat doubtfull

of that, which the ſaid de La Noue had obſerued, and told him, that his wiues belly was big, and that ſhe was qualmiſh and diſtaſted, vomiting euery morning, which made him ſuſpect that ſhe was with child: whereupon a Midwife tolde him that there was no likelihood, nay it was impoſſible to thinke that a yong woman of eighteene yeares of age ſhould be with child, her husband hauing neuer entred within her maiden cloiſter: and that with threſhing onely at the barne doore, ſhe could not be full. Whereupon Maſter Pietre, was ſent for, who though at firſt he could not be induced to beleeue it, yet at length, hauing well conſidered therof, gaue his iudgement, that ſhee was with childe, which proued true, for about ſome foure Moneths after the inciſion was made, ſhee was happily deliuered at her full time of a faire daughter.
                     
                        Mad. Scaron ſent for me, to helpe a Farmers wife,Another ſtorie. that was great with childe, and ready to lye downe, who had had the outward orifice of her womb, for the ſpace of foure or fiue yeares, ſo perfectly cloſed, glued and ioined together, that it was impoſſible to put a little probe therein: the which had happened vnto her, by beeing ill deliuered, by meanes whereof, the entrance of the outward necke of the wombe, had beene exulcerated, and the vlcers cicatriz'd, and the ſides of the ſaid necke ioined together: and yet for all this ſhe proued with child. At the time of her deliuery, by the aduiſe and councell of Maſter Riolan, and Charles the Kings profeſſors in Phiſicke, and Regent Doctor in the faculty of Phiſicke

at Paris, Brunet, Paradis, Riollan, Fremin, Rabigois: and Serre (Queen Marguerites Chirurgion) Mitton, and Choffinet, Maiſter Barber Chirurgions at Paris, Honore the Kings Chirurgion, and my ſelfe, I ſay by the aduiſe of all theſe, there was an inciſion made, then preſently the Speculum dilatatorium was ſo wel applied, that al the Cicatrizes were inlarged, which ſucceeded ſo proſperouſly, that within three houres after, ſhe was deliuered with much eaſe.
                     
                        The deliuery that is too ſoone or too late, doth prooue difficult.4 The trauaile may likewiſe proue difficult, and painfull, when the woman is deliuered before or after her time; before her time, as when it comes in the ſixth, ſeuenth, or eighth Moneth: which happens when the wombe is too moiſt and weake, or elſe full, and as it were ſtuft with much ſlime, which doth ſo moiſten the necke therof, that it is inlarged and dilated before the limited time. As alſo the veſſels, to the orifices whereof, the after burthen is faſtned, do begin to be relaxed, which cauſeth that the child cannot be ſupported nor remaine in his naturall ſituation. By which change, finding the inner orifice looſened, and inlarged: and the membrane wherein the waters are contained, and in which the child ſwimmeth, to be very ſmall, and thinne: it begins to breake, which maketh the child out of order, and ſo cauſeth difficult deliuery. As alſo too much dryneſſe,Effect of too much drines. as it were, want of nouriſhment, when the mother is not well nouriſhed, hauing not wherewith to ſuſtaine the child, which makes the ſaid child, not hauing ſufficient nouriſhment, to turne and winde himſelfe ſeeking about for it, and

caſts it ſelfe downe, and vnlooſneth his bed (which is the after-burthen) from the ſides of the wombe: and in the end breakes the membrane wherein the waters are contained, and ſtriueth to come foorth, for the moſt part out of order. The like hapneth to them, that go till the tenth, or eleuenth moneth: becauſe the child through the length of time, that it ſtayeth in the mothers wombe, doth grow, and waxe bigger, though the parts of the mother, wherby the child (being thus big) is to come forth, and paſſe through, are not increaſed or inlarged at all; which cauſeth (the paſſages being not able to bee ſufficiently dilated and widened) great anguiſh, and paine, to the mother eſpecially, ſhee beeing weakned in all her parts, that ſerue for the expulſion, and bringing forth of the child: which among the reſt, are the Matrice, and the Muſcles of the vpper belly; which being ſtretched beyond meaſure, through the greatneſſe and bigneſſe of the child, do inlarge the fibres, which cannot afterward be ſo eaſily drawen together, hauing loſt their proper force, and ſtrength.
                     And this may be manifeſtly perceiued,A good obſeruation. in thoſe that cannot make water; the bladder being too full, that although the paſſage be opened by a probe, yet the Chirurgion is conſtrained to preſſe the belly, ſo to help the fibres of the bladder, to cloſe, and fould themſelues together. Beſides, the child filling vp all the ſpace that is in the wombe, cannot help it ſelfe ſo well in thruſting forward, being, as it were, fettred, and lock't faſt therein.
                     
                        
                        Cauſes from the child.3. The like hindrance of deliuerie may proceed from the child, who hauing attained vnto the ninth moneth, is not able to come into the world, either through weakneſſe, and feebleneſſe; or becauſe he is not perfected, and ripened as he ſhould, and ſo hath not ſufficient ſtrength to diſſolue the ligaments, and veſſels: and to break aſunder the membranes, wherein he is incloſed: which cauſeth, that after he hath ſtriued in the ninth moneth, and attempting it againe in the tenth,A double conflict of the child. he is not able to ſtriue ſo luſtily for his comming foorth, hauing been weakned with forcing himſelfe the moneth before. And it is moſt certaine, that the childs ſtaying, in the wombe after the ninth moneth, doth proceed onely from want of vitall heat, which is in the heart;Why the child is ſtaid from comming foorth. or that he hath it not in ſufficient quantitie to deſire the Aire, which we draw in to coole vs: or that all the parts of his bodie, are not ſtrong, and able enough, to draw vnto them ſufficient nouriſhment.
                     
                        Another cauſe of difficult deliuerie.This difficultie of deliuerie happens alſo, when the child is either ſicke, or dead; and is not able to help it ſelfe: as likewiſe, when he is too big in all his bodie, and chiefly in the head: or if he be a Monſter, hauing two heads, two bodies, foure armes, or legs: or if they be Twins; th'one hindring the others comming foorth:Diuers ſituations of the child. which will be euident by the bigneſſe of the Mother: or if he be ill placed to come foorth, putting formoſt an arme, or a leg, or both; the ſhoulder, buttockes, ſide, or belly comming formoſt.
                     
                        4 Now concerning that which is annexed to the child, the deliuerie proues difficult,Cauſe from things annexed to the child. if the membranes, that containes the water, wheron the child doth floate, and ſwim, be firme, ſolide, and hard, that it cannot, but verie hardly be broken: or that the ſaid membrane be ſo thin, that it breakes too ſoone, and before the child be well turned, and ready to follow the ſaid water, which ſerues to carrie him, and make him come foorth the eaſier: For the child that remaines drie, commeth into the world with much paine.
                     Likewiſe, if the after-burthen offer it ſelfe firſt, and that it ſtop the paſſage: or if there be a Mole, or falſe Conception; As alſo if the woman haue not been lately at ſtoole, or made water:The retention of excrements hinders the deliuerie. the which is cauſe, that the great gut being full, may cloſe the necke of the wombe: as likewiſe the bladder being full may preſſe it downe, becauſe it is placed betweene them both. Whence it is commonly ſaid in the prouerb; Que l'enfant eſt ſitué enter le boire, &amp; le manger, which is; That the child is ſeated, between the meat, and the drinke. And therefore, all the aforeſaid accidents muſt be remedied accordingly.
                  
                  
                     The meanes to help Women that are deliuered with difficultie. CHAP. IX.
                     
                     
                        THat a Woman,Direction for the Chirurgian. which is deliuered with difficultie, and much paine, may be help'd: the Chirurgian ought to know, what is the cauſe thereof, and from

whence this difficultie doth proceed: that he may the better cure it.
                     If it be, becauſe the Mother is to groſſe, or fat, and chiefly in her naturall parts, as alſo if there be any ſtore of fat offer it ſelfe; (as I haue ſeen it oftentimes happen in great ſtriuing, and throwes,) yea, and that in ſuch ſort, that it did euen ſtop the paſſage of the child; Then the Chirurgion, (as gently as he can poſſibly) muſt thruſt backe, and put aſide with one hand, the ſaid fat, not tearing or hurting it,Meanes to help them that are too fat. leaſt it be ſpoiled and corrupted afterwards; holding it ſtill downe on the one ſide, till the child be come foorth of the wombe, keeping it alwaies from falling downe into the paſſage, and among the bones, when the child is readdy to come foorth.
                     
                        Conſiderations for the Bladder.But when part of the bladder, is ſunke downe and relaxed, and is manifeſtly perceiued in the entrance of the wombe: then muſt he do the like, as he did to the fat, holding it aſide vpward, with the flat of two or three of his fingers, vntill the childs head be paſt the Os Pubis. If he find then (as it may ſo come to paſſe) that the ſaid bladder be full of vrine: the woman in trauaile not hauing made water,The woman muſt be prouoked to make water. a good while before; then muſt he cauſe her to make water, by putting a fit inſtrument gently into the bladder. For it is ſeen in ſome, that the fibres,An Obſeruation. which doe contract the bladder, and make it driue out the vrine, are ſo weakned, and alſo the whole bodie thereof, that the vrine cannot come foorth.
                     
                        Some women haue been deceiued,A thing worthy to be noted. by taking the ſaid bladder, thus full with vrine, for the waters which come before the child, cauſing the ſaid bladder to be broken: the which is worthy of great conſideration. Alſo the ſaid necke of the bladder may be ſtop't, by reaſon of ſome Carnoſitie, Inflammation, or ſtone,A notable ſtorie. which I haue ſeen an honeſt woman, there being a ſtone fallen down into the necke in her bladder, that ſtopt her vrine, which being put aſide by the probe, ſhe made water: Neuertheleſſe, when the child was ready to come foorth, the ſtone returning in to the ſaid necke of the bladder againe, did ſo fret and hurt it, through the long ſtay, that the childs head made in the paſſage, that it grew to an Impoſtume and ſuppuration, which made a little hole, through the which ſhe hath long time made her water, not being able to hold or retaine it; which is a ſtorie worthy to be mark'd. But as the vrine may be ſometimes ſtop't, ſo likewiſe the excrements of the great gut may be retained: which hapning, it will be more then neceſſarie for the cure thereof, to giue the woman a Clyſter, that may both vnload her, of her excrements,The excrements muſt be voided. and likewiſe help and make her deliuerie the more eaſie.
                     I my ſelfe was preſent at the trauaile of a poore ſicke woman,Another ſtorie. that had not been at ſtoole in ten daies before, whoſe great gut was ſo fild and ſtuft with excrements, as hard as a ſtone, that it was impoſſible for her to receiue a Clyſter; and we were conſtrain'd, before ſhe could be deliuered, to get

out all the ſaid excrements, otherwiſe it had been impoſſible, to haue taken foorth the child.
                     To help and ſuccour one that is lean and barren, or elſe of little ſtature, as alſo ſuch as are either too old, or too young: they muſt haue recourſe long before hand, vnto medicines that ſhall mollifie, moiſten, and relaxe; not onely the membranes, which ought to be dilated and ſtretch'd, that they may be made more ſouple and gentle; But likewiſe you muſt annoint the Cartilages, and Ligaments that ioine the Os pubis, Sacrum, Os Coccygis, and Ilium, which muſt be done with oyntments already ſet downe, and euen in the verie houre of the deliuerie, annoynt all the ſaid parts therewith.
                     Some miſlike not, about the end of the ninth moneth, to bathe the woman, either with a generall or particular bath, as we haue heretofore appointed; as likewiſe to giue her, euery morning, eight or ten daies before her lying in, this Drinke.

                           
                              A Drinke to make eaſie the deliuerie. Take Oile of ſweet Almonds, drawen without fire, an ounce, water of Parietary, two ounces, mingle th
                                 •
                              m together, and let her drinke it.
                        
The which I haue oftentimes tried in many women, and among the reſt, in Madame Capp, who before had been many times deliuered with much paine and ſorrow, of her children, dead. But ſince I counſell'd her to vſe this medicine, ſhe hath been deliuered (thankes be to God) verie fortunately of many children liuing. The ſame remedies do likewiſe ſerue for them, that haue any Calloſitie, or hardneſſe, in the paſſage of Nature.
                     
                        The weake and dainty women muſt be fed with yelkes of egges, cullis, a toſt with wine and ſugar,Remedy for the dainty. or Hyppocras: and that a little at a time, and often, you may alſo giue them a little confection of Alhermes diſſolued, either in wine or Hippocras: Cinamon water alſo that is well made, and not too ſtrong, is very fit and good.
                     And if the feare of the paine doth hinder the deliuery, then the woman muſt be incouraged,Fear of paine. telling her that ſhee ſhall bee quickly freed from this ſickneſſe, and that it is common vnto all women, to haue ſuch paines, cheriſhing her with good hopes, aſſuring her that her trauaile will bee very eaſie, and promiſing her,A good deceit. that ſhe ſhall haue either a ſonne or a daughter, according as you know ſhe deſires, as we haue ſaid before, flattering and ſoothing her as much as you can, without chiding or giuing her any croſſe ſpeeches at all.
                     The moſt grieuous and troubleſome accident,Cauſe of the moſt troubleſome deliuery which a Woman can haue, that is in trauaile, is when there happens vnto her, any fluxe, of bloud, or Convulſions; for either of them kill both the Mother and the child inſtantly, eſpecially, if the fluxe of bloud continue long: becauſe through the great loſſe of bloud (which is the liues treaſure) the ſpirits and heate are diſſolued.
                     And concerning Convulſions,Why Conuulſions are dangerous. they are very dangerous; becauſe the braine beeing hurt, it cannot affoord ſuch ſtore of ſpirits as are needfull, for the reſpiration of the Mother, and the child, who breath's onely by meanes of the ſpirits, that are imparted

vnto him by the Arteryes of his mother, which cauſeth him to bee choked and ſtifled. Beſides, the great convulſion, makes the Midrife, and the muſcles of the vpper belly, moue ſo violently, that the child is much ſhaken, and puts both him and his mother in danger to be ſtifled, and die.
                     
                        What muſt bee done in fluxes and convulſions.Eyther of theſe accidents happening, or elſe both together, the mother and the child muſt bee ſuccoured without any delay, which ſhall bee done (to ſpeake in a word) by deliuering her. And this ought to be done, either by the helpe of a Chirurgian, or elſe of a very skilfull Midwife.
                     
                        
                           Lib. de ſuper faetatione. A good ſentence of Hypocrates.
                        
                        Hippocrates well obſerued it, when he ſaith. If in a difficult trauaile there happen a great fluxe of bloud, without any paine before the trauaile, then is there danger leſt the child come forth dead, or that he will not liue, and therefore ſhe muſt bee ſodainely deliuered, the which wee haue oftentimes ſeene (to our great griefe) happen vnto diuers women, that haue died, through the obſtinaſy of their friends and kinsfolks; yea and ſome alſo through their Phiſitians and Chirurgians feare, who delayed the time, thinking, and hoping that the fluxe would ſtay: telling them that the child came naturally, being well placed, with his head forward and that the mother ſhould bee deliuered euen of her ſelfe.
                     I know there be many, both Phiſitians and Chirurgians, that will appoint diuers inward, and outward medicines, yea to make reuulſion and altar the courſe of bloud, will cauſe a vaine to bee opened

in the arme once or twice: rather then conſent to this practize. But yet of all their medicines, I could neuer ſee any that did good, but that in the end they were conſtrained to vſe the hand: the which I counſell to be done ſpeedily, and chieflie if the mother be at her full time, and ready to lye downe; which may be both knowne of the woman, and alſo perceiued by the throwes ſhee hath, or which went before: as alſo by the dilatation of of the inner orifice of the wombe, which will be open: and likewiſe feeling with the finger, that the waters are gathered and ready to come and iſſue forth.A good obſeruation. And when the water ſhall bee broken and come away, then ſo much the rather muſt the child be taken out; though the woman haue not gone aboue foure, fiue, ſixe, ſeuen, or eight moneths.Sometimes the waters muſt bee let forth. And ye muſt note that if the ſaid water be not broken, and that the fluxe of bloud bee very great; then you ſhall let forth the water, by dilating, and ſtretching gently the inner orifice of the womb: thereby to draw forth the child, as we will ſhew heereafter.
                     But becauſe many women are ſubiect to a fluxe of bloud, in their fourth, fifth, ſixth, ſeuenth,Caution concerning the fluxe of bloud or eighth moneth of child-bearing: being not as yet ready to bee deliuered: therefore the Chirurgion muſt obſerue from what place this bloud is ſent, the which may be from the entrance or Vagina of the wombe, and not from within the body thereof, where the child is contained, and incloſed, which may bee eaſily perceiued, if the woman haue no throwes, or if the inner orifice of her wombe be not

open, but cloſe ſhut: then there is no likelihood of any deliuery towards, for bloud may iſſue and come from the ſaid outward necke,When they muſt not bee deliuered in a fluxe of bloud or Vagina, both in maide and woman with child: If it bee ſo, then it will not be needful, to meddle with ſuch women, or to force them at all, but onely you muſt proceed to medicines, that ſhall ſtay the ſaid fluxe of bloud. As wee will ſhew in the chapter of the after purgings that flow immoderately in women newly deliuered.
                     
                        A worthy ſē
                           tence of Hippocrates. Lib. 1. de Morb. Mulier.
                        It may alſo happen becauſe the woman is plethoricall, and full of bloud: In this caſe we muſt follow the opinion of Hippocrates, who ſaith, that if a woman that is in trauaile, cannot be deliuered, and that her paines continue many daies: if ſhee bee young, luſty, and full of bloud you may let her bleed in the foot, if her ſtrength will beare it.
                     
                        Other accidents that may hinder the deliuery.But if ſhe be troubled with any vlcer, tumor, excreſcence of fleſh, Hemorrhoides, inflammation, chapps, or the like, which may chance in the necke of the wombe; then ſhall ſhe be handled, as we will ſhew in their proper places. All the which indiſpoſitions may make the deliuery difficult, and cauſe, that the parts cannot be dilated, according as it is ſit and neceſſary, for the childs comming forth.
                     For remedying the deliuery, that is too ſoone, or too late: we muſt haue regard vnto the cauſe, and according thereto it muſt bee cured, and chiefly that, which ſhall concerne the mother; whereof we will treat, when we come to ſpeake of the Abortment: it being my purpoſe in this place, to ſpeake

onely of thoſe things which are fit, and ought to bee done in the time, and at the houre of the deliuerie.
                     Now for the comforting of a woman,Cure when the fault is frō the child. and eaſing of her trauaile, when the difficulty doth proceede from the child; as when he is weake, tender, ſickly, or dead: as likewiſe if he be too big, or a monſter hauing two heads, or if he be ill turned, and that he offer himſelfe amiſſe: then the Chirurgion in this caſe ſhall helpe, and ſet to his hand in this manner.
                     Firſt, if it be through the weakeneſſe, or tenderneſſe of the child being ſicke: the Chirurgion muſt not delay one minute of time,When the deliuery muſt be haſtned. to haſten the deliuery, and he muſt incourage the woman to doe the like. If the head come firſt, then ſhall hee proceed therein gently, as in the naturall deliuery: applying beneath, and chiefly about the fundament, and os Pubis, which are the two vtmoſt parts of the naturall paſſage, ſome ointments with the fingers ends, Ointments made for the purpoſe. hauing his nayles pared very cloſe. For this annointing wil prouoke and ſtirre vp the Matrice, to thruſt out the child. The oyntment is this.

                     Of diuers deliueries wherein the operation of the hand is vſed. And firſt what the Chirurgion ought to conſider before hee ſets to his hand. CHAP. X.
                     
                     
                        WHen the Chirurgion ſhall bee called to deliuer a woman that is in trauaile and cannot bee deliuered naturally: before he venter to doe any thing, he muſt conſider two things:Two things muſt be conſidered in theſe deliueries. the firſt is to know whether the mother haue ſtrength enough to endure the violence of Manuall operation: and hauing found that ſhe is able, he muſt then ſearch, whether the child be dead, or aliue, for ſometimes the child is taken dead, and ſometimes aliue out of the mothers wombe.
                     Now as concerning the Mother:Conſiderations concerning the mother. Firſt the Chirurgion muſt behold her face, heare her ſpeake, obſerue her doings, countenance, &amp;behauiour, then preſently muſt he feele her pulſe, which if he find to be equall, ſtrong, not intermitting, and that ſhe bee not much changed from her wonted diſpoſition? and likewiſe if the poore woman, her friends and kinsfolkes doe intreate him to helpe her, aſſuring him, that ſhe will courageouſly endure; all that he

ſhall doe vnto her: then following the aduiſe of her kinsfolkes and friends,The mother doth hazard her life in the deliuery. he muſt go about it: foretelling them neuertheleſſe; that this kind of practiſe is very dangerous, and that the mother venters her life, ſeeing that the child is either dead; or elſe likely to die, if he be not already.
                     But if the Chirurgion find, that her face and ſpeach is decayed, and weakned, her countenance changed, her pulſe ſmall frequent, ſometime intermitting and formicant: and that ſhee hath often ſwounings,Remedyes muſt not bee diſ
                              •
                           amed. Convulſions, and cold ſweats: then hee muſt forbeare for feare leaſt hee be blamed, and thereby diſcredit thoſe meanes which ſhould haue profited, and may alſo doe good vnto others.
                     
                        Signes of the childs being aliue.Now you may know by theſe ſignes whether the child be aliue, or dead. If the child ſtirre it is a ſigne he is aliue; which the Mother may coniecture, and alſo the Chirurgion, by laying his hand vpon her belly. And for the better aſſurance heereof, hee muſt ſlide vp his hand into the Womans Matrice, and ſearch for the childs Nauell. If, in holding it betweene his fingers, he feele a beating of the Arteries, as alſo, if by laying his hand vpon the childs temples, or elſe handling the wriſt or ſole of his foot he find, that the Arteries doe beate, and likewiſe, if in putting his finger into the childs mouth he perceiue that he either ſucke, or wag his tongue, it is a ſigne that he is aliue.
                     
                        Signes that the child is dead.Contrariwiſe, if the foreſaid things doe not concurre, and that the mother feele a heauineſſe, and that in turning of her ſelfe, (whether it bee on the

right ſide, or the left) the child doth fall like a boule, if her belly be cold, and that there comes an ill ſent from her, if her breath ſmell ſtrong, and her countenance look wanne, and of the colour of lead: and that the childs Nauell, or after birth offer it ſelfe formoſt, beſides, if the chirurgion, putting his hand vp, findes the child to be cold, without pulſe, neither ſucking, nor mouing his tongue: then I ſay it may be iudged, that the child is dead.
                     But as the child may offer himſelfe, being dead,The child commeth after diuers faſhions. in diuers poſitions, or faſhion; So likewiſe muſt we vſe diuers conſiderations and meanes to draw him forth: as wee will more particularly ſhew heereafter.
                  
                  
                     The meanes to helpe a woman in trauaile, hauing withall a fluxe of bloud, or Convulſions. CHAP. XI.
                     
                     
                        WE haue ſhew'd you before, that a woman being in trauaile, and hauing either a fluxe of bloud, or Convulſions, ſhe muſt be ſpeedily helped, becauſe the deferring or delay thereof, will endanger her life.
                     Wherefore you muſt proceed heerein after this manner. And ſince that in euery deliuery, the ſituation is a matter of great conſequence,Situation fit in al deliueries. to make it the more facile and eaſy: therefore you muſt begin in this ſort.
                     
                        
                        The right placing of them.Firſt the woman muſt be laid ouerthwart a bed, both for the better conueniencie of the Chirurgion, or Midwife, that ſhall deliuer her, and alſo that ſhe may be held, and ſtayed behind the faſter, by ſome ſtrong bodie,The commoditie thereof. ſo that ſhe neither ſlip forward, nor backward, in the operation or drawing forth of the child. Likewiſe, there muſt be one on each ſide of her to hold her knees and thighs firme, and to keep them aſunder one from another: her knees muſt be bow'd, and her heeles drawen vpward, (as we haue ſaid before in the Naturall deliuerie,) her head muſt be laid vpon a boulſter lying croſſe the bed; her backe being a little raiſed, and her hips lifted ſomewhat higher, with pillowes laid vnder them, and her hinder parts muſt lie within halfe a foot of the beds ſide. She muſt haue a linnen cloth three or foure times double laid vpon her ſtomacke and belly, that may reach downe ouer her knees, euen to the middeſt of the leg: So that neither wind, nor cold may offend her, nor any of the aſſiſtants ſee what the Chirurgion toucheth, or doth: and likewiſe, that the woman be not afraid of him, when he ſhall be about his buſineſſe. And therefore Hippocrates for this reaſon, would haue the womans eyes ſhut or couer'd.
                     When the woman is thus placed, the Chirurgion muſt put vp his hand (being firſt annointed) into the firſt entrance of the naturall parts,The clots of bloud muſt be taken away. that he may take foorth all the clots of bloud, which he ſhall find there.
                     Then he muſt conſider, whether the inner necke

be wide enough for him to thruſt in his hand, and to turne the childe, if it be needfull: Now if the inner necke be not ſufficiently dilated,The inner neck may be dilated. then ſhall he, as gently as poſſibly he can, and without any violence (hauing firſt annionted all the parts thereof with freſh Butter, or ſome ointment) ſtretch it by little and little, till he get in his hand: if the water be not broken, he need not be afraid to let it out: then preſently if the child come with his head formoſt, he ſhall turne him gently to find his feet, which he may do more eaſily, then if the waters had been let foorth before: becauſe, that much moiſture doth make the child ſlide, and turne better, then when he is drie. And when he hath found one of his feet, he muſt draw it gently without violence, and tie about it a piece of riband, with a ſliding knot,How the feet may be found that he may put the foot in againe (leauing the riband hanging out) to make the more roome for his hand to goe in and ſearch for the other foot, which may be done by ſliding his hand al along the childes thigh. And hauing found them both, he ſhall draw them out gently in a direct line, giuing the woman a little breathing, and bidding her to ſtraine her ſelfe when ſhe feeles any throwes, or paines, then the Chirurgion (hauing in a readineſſe a fine linnen cloth warme, he muſt wrap it about the childes thighs, for feare leaſt he ſlip out of his hand, if he tooke him naked) and ſo pluck gently, vntill his buttockes appeare, and the body with the head doth follow; obſeruing neuertheleſſe, that his belly and breaſt be turned

downeward, as we will ſhew hereafter more particularly.
                     Experience will make it manifeſt vnto vs, by the ſtories following, how neceſſarie it is to deliuer a woman with child, when a fluxe of bloud, or conuulſions do continue: and that ſhe cannot be ſaued by ordinarie medicines.
                     
                        A ſtorie.The yeare 1599. Madam Simon yet aliue daughter to Mr. Pareus, Counſellour, and chiefe Chirurgion to the King; being ready to lie downe was ſurpriſed with a great flux of bloud, hauing about her Mad. la Charomie for her Midwife, and likewiſe Mr. Hautin the Kings Phiſition in ordinarie, and Mr. Rigault Doctors of Phiſicke in Paris, and becauſe of great ſwounings that tooke her euery quarter of an houre through the loſſe of bloud ſhe had: Master Marchant my ſon in law and my ſelfe were ſent for; But I finding her almoſt without pulſe, hauing her voice weake,The Chirurgion muſt foretell the danger. and her lips pale: I told her mother and her husband that ſhe was in great danger of her life, and that there was but one way to ſaue her, which was, to deliuer her ſpeedily: the which I had ſeene practized by the late Mr. Pareus her Father, who had cauſed me to do the like, vnto a Gentlewoman of Mad. de Seneterre. Then her mother, and her husband earneſtly intreated vs to helpe her, and that they would put her into our hands to diſpoſe of her. And ſo ſodainely, following the aduiſe of the Phiſitions, ſhe was very happily deliuered of a liuely child.
                     
                        Another ſtorie.The yeare 1600. I was commanded to goe and

viſit a great Lady, that was taken with a great and violent flux of bloud, through a fright ſhe had of a great thunder clap: being come vnto her,They muſt reſt in a flux of bloud. I found that her flux was much mitigated: but ſhe being conſtrained to goe twelue, or fifteene leagues from Paris, and fearing leaſt that the ſaid flux ſhould continue, ſhe was brought thither by my ſonne in law Mr. Marchant by water: where ſhe was no ſoner arriued, but her flux of bloud tooke her againe, which made him diſlike it, and iudge that it would proue ill, contrarie to the opinion of Maſter de la Riuiere, the Kings chiefe Phiſition, who was there at the ſame time: Whereupon, I was preſently ſent for in poſt together with Maſter Renard the Kings Phiſition. We being come thither, found things in better eſtate; and the ſaid Maſter de la Riuiere, tooke leaue to goe towards the King. But on a ſodaine the ſaid flux began a freſh, which made them ſend for Mr. Mareſcot, and Mr 
                        Martin, the kings Phyſitions, who notwithſtanding were not come before her deliuerie: which the kinsfolks &amp; friends of the ſaid Ladie, and likewiſe Mr 
                        Renard, Mr 
                        Marchant, and my ſelfe, were of opinion to haſten, becauſe of the great loſſe of bloud ſhe had, and the often ſwounning that tooke her: but as ſoone as ſhe was deliuered, the flux of bloud ceaſed.
                     The yeare 1603, Madame Danzé, or Chece,
                        The third ſtorie. being in trauaile, was taken with the like flux of bloud, which held her from morning till eight or nine of the clocke at night; hauing with her the Queenes Midwife, Mad. Bourſiere, Maſter le Fieure, Riolan,

Le Moine, regent Doctors in the facultie of Phyſicke at Paris, and Mr 
                        de Sainct Germain maſter Apothecarie, were called to looke vnto her; and becauſe ſhe loſt much bloud, they called Mr 
                        Honoré the kings Chirurgion, who being vnwilling to attempt any thing without my aduiſe, I was likewiſe ſent for. And as ſoone as I was come, my opinion with the reſt of the companie was, to deliuer her: which was done by the ſaid Honoré, the child liuing.
                     
                        The fourth hiſtorie.Of late memorie, Mad. Coulon (being aſſiſted in her trauaile by Mad. la Charonne, a verie skilfull Midwife,) hauing a great flux of bloud; after that Mr 
                        Martin, Hautin, Cornuty, Pietre, the kings Phyſitions, and Doctors of Paris, had giuen her many things for the ſtaying of the ſaid flux, in the end for feare leaſt by looſing her bloud, ſhe might alſo looſe her life, falling into a ſyncope: with their aduiſe ſhe was deliuered, by the ſaid Honoré, and preſently her flux was ſtaied.
                     
                        An Admonition for young Chirurgions.But as theſe women and children aforeſaid haue been ſaued, by being deliuered in time: So likewiſe theſe following, loſt their liues, becauſe they were not ſuccoured, as Art and experience did require, their kinsfolks and friends being vnwilling to haue any go about it in due time: whereof theſe two hiſtories may beare witneſſe.
                     
                        Another ſtorie.
                        Mad. Vion being readie to be deliuer'd, fell into a great flux of bloud, and though ſome were of opinion, to deliuer her without further delay; yet this being deferred vpon the counſell of others,

who hop'd to ſtay the flux with ordinarie medicines, they ſuffered her to looſe her bloud, by little and little, and at laſt to looſe her life. The ſame chance hapned to Madame Gaſselin, who not hauing help in time, dyed euen as it was foretold, it would come to paſſe; hauing loſt all her bloud, before ſhe would giue her conſent to be deliuer'd: which will be a good occaſion, to admoniſh a young Chirurgion, neuer to defer this worke when he is called, and ſees a great euacuation of bloud. It is now fiue and twentie yeares, ſince I ſaw this practized, by the late Mr 
                        Pareus, and Mr 
                        Hubert, of whom, we are bound to acknowledge, and willingly confeſſe, that we haue learned both this and many other experiments.
                     
                        Mad. de Mommor,
                        Another ſtorie agreeing with this purpoſe. being about fiue and twentie yeares of age, and neere her time of deliuerie, one day found her ſelfe ill, about foure or fiue a clocke in the morning, neuertheleſſe ſhe roſe and went to Church, which was neere her houſe, her paine by fits began againe, and ſhe fell into a continuall flux of bloud: At three daies end ſhe was deliuered with great eaſe, without any help of the Midwife: and preſently after, followed the after burthen: Neuertheleſſe ſhe died the ſame day, at night: and was kept a prettie while by her friends, who could not perſwade themſelues, that ſhe was dead: At laſt being opened by Mr 
                        Pineau, the kings ſworne Chirurgion at Paris, in the preſence of Mr 
                        Faber, and Mr 
                        Baillou, regent Doctors of the facultie of Phyſicke, at Paris; her wombe was found

broken, and rent, right in that place, where the veine and arterie hypogaſtricke, aſcend toward the mid'ſt thereof; which likewiſe were diſſolued, and gaue way to all that iſſue of bloud.
                     As for the convulſions which commonly happen through the childs great ſtriuing, when hee deſires to come forth; and (not being turned aright) doth ſo extend the womb that the ſaid convulſions, follow thereupon: here it is to be feared, leaſt all within, wil be torne and broken,Stories concerning convulſions. and therefore it is conuenient to deliuer the woman, with all poſſible ſpeed, which hath beene practized both by my ſelfe, and of late by Maſter Binet a ſworn Chirurgion of Paris, a man of great experience, who being ſent for by Doctor Bouuart, to deliuer Opportune Guerreau, the wife of Silueſter the Printer: which had beene in labour from eight a clock in the morning, till nine at night: and finding her pulſe very weake and ſmall, as alſo the woman depriued of all ſence and motion,The Chirurgions wiſdom at the firſt he was ſomwhat fearefull. But being intreated by her Husband, and fearing leaſt ſhee might either die ſuddenly, or elſe fall into convulſions: he putting his hand into her wombe, found the childs head, (the water not being broke) which he let out, and preſently deliuered her with much eaſe, and ſhee is yet liuing. Therefore wee need not expect, till the ſaid convulſions grow ſtronger, for fear leaſt the wombe be broken, and torne through the great ſtriuing of the child, when hee is not able to come foorth, as wee may plainely ſee by the ſtories following.
                     
                        The yeare 1607. the ſaid Maſter Binet was ſent for, together with de le Moine,
                        A wonderfull ſtory. and Alton Maſter Barber Chirurgion at Paris, to cut vp the dead body of Ione du Boys, and hauing opened her nether belly, found the child vpon the guts, who had bruſed &amp; broken the wombe, and paſſed quite through it, there being ſtore of bloud ſhed in the capacity of the ſaid belly.
                     Maſter Pineau, Guerin,
                        Another ſtorie. and Launay ſworne Chirurgians of Paris, can beare me witneſſe, that in opening a poore woman, that died in the Hoſpitall of the Citty: we found her child ſwimming among the guts in her belly, the bottome of her Matrice being rent and torne.
                  
                  
                     The meanes to helpe a woman when her after-burthen comes for moſt. CHAP. XII.
                     
                     
                        IF the after-burthen offer it ſelfe formoſt,When the after burthen comes formoſt, there is a fluxe of bloud. the moſt ſure and ready way to helpe the Woman is to deliuer her ſpeedily, becauſe moſt commonly there follows, a continuall fluxe of bloud. For that the orifices of the veines are opened, which are ſpread in the ſides of the wombe, and there meet with the veſſels of the afterburthen: and when the Matrice doth ſtrain and force it ſelfe, to put forth the child, then doth it thruſt out both the bloud that is contained therin, and that which is drawne thither, either by any

heat or paine. Beſides, when the child is incloſed in the wombe, and the orifice thereof, ſtopt with the after-birth: then hee cannot breath any longer by his Mothers Arteryes,How the child is ſtifled. and ſo for want of helpe, he will be quickly choked, and euen ſwallowed vp in the bloud, which is contained in the wombe, and which iſſueth from the veynes that are open therein.
                     But before you attempt any thing, theſe two points muſt be obſerued: Firſt, whether the afterburthen bee come foorth but a little, or elſe very much: if it bee but little (when the mother is well placed) it muſt be thruſt,Obſeruatiōs to draw forth the after burthen. and put backe againe with as much care, as may poſſibly be. And if the head of the child come firſt, let it bee placed right in the paſſage, thereby to helpe the naturall deliuery, but if you find any difficulty, or if you perceiue that the childs head cannot eaſily bee brought forward, or that the child, or his mother, or both together bee weake, foreſeeing that the trauaile will bee long, then without doubt the beſt and ſureſt way is, to ſearch for the feete (as we haue ſaid) and to plucke him forth gently by them.
                     
                        Another obſeruation.The other point to bee obſerued is, that if the ſaid after-birth be much come foorth, and that it cannot bee put backe againe: as well by reaſon of the bignes of it, as alſo of the fluxe of bloud, that commonly companies it: and likewiſe if the child follow it cloſe,When the afterbirth muſt be drawne forth. ſtaying onely to come into the world: then muſt the after-burthen be puld away quite, and when it is come forth, it muſt be laide aſide,

without cutting of the ſtring that cleaues vnto it. For by the guiding of the ſaid ſtring, you may eaſily find the child, who whether hee bee aliue or dead, muſt be drawn out by the legs, with as much dexterity as may be. And this muſt be done onely in great neceſſity, that the child may bee quickly drawne forth: as it may be eaſily iudged by the ſentence of Hippocrates, who ſaith,
                           Lib. 1. de morbis Mulier. The after-birth muſt come laſt. 
                        that the after-burthen ſhould come forth after the child, for if it come firſt, the child cannot liue, becauſe he takes his life from it, as a plant doth from the earth.
                     
                     Sometime it chaunceth, that a part of the after-birth, as alſo the membrane which containes the waters doe offer it ſelfe like a skin, and comes forth ſometimes the length of halfe a foote, which happens to ſuch women as haue the skin wherein the waters are contained ſwelling out to the bignes of ones fiſt and more, which breaking foorth of themſelues, leaue the skinnne hanging forth, and yet the child not following it, which happening,It muſt bee puld gently. it muſt not be violently puld away: becauſe the afterburthen oftentimes, is not wholly looſened from the ſides of the wombe. So that in drawing that, you ſhall likewiſe draw the ſaide after burthen, and ſo conſequently, the womb, or elſe part therof, which commonly brings the woman into extream paines, and fainting, yea, and oftentimes to death: Which hapned (to my great griefe) vnto a Gentlewoman,A ſtory. that died as ſoone as ſhee was deliuered, who putting her ſelfe into her nurſes hands, who tooke vpon her to be a Midwife: and was ſo ventrous, as to

plucke and draw forth the ſaid Membrane, and part of the after-burthen, which came to light by means of her Chamber-maid, who had kept it, and ſhewed it vs after her deceaſe: we being very inquiſitiue to know the cauſe of her death.
                     
                        The remedy.But when this happens, it muſt not be puld away but rather gently be thruſt in againe, or elſe you may put in your hand, betweene that, and the neck of the wombe, to find the childs feete, and ſo draw him forth, as we haue ſhewed before.
                     I haue ſet downe this ſtory more at large, by reaſon of the great ſorrow I tooke; for this Gentlewomans death, whom I had deliuered twice before, with mine own hands, comming not ſoone enough to helpe her the third time.
                  
                  
                     The meanes to deliuer a woman when her child is dead, in her wombe. CHAP. XIII.
                     
                     WHen it is certainly knowne, that the child is dead, the woman muſt bee placed in the ſame manner, as it hath beene ſhew'n, where wee ſpake of the taking forth of the child, when there is a fluxe of bloud.
                     
                        What muſt be done whē the childe coms ill.If he put forth an arme, ſhoulder, backe, belly, or other part of his body firſt, hee muſt be turned with all diligence, and drawne forth by the feete, as we will more particularly declare, in euery ſeuerall deliuery, according to the ſundry faſhions, wherein he may come, either aliue or dead.
                     
                        If he come dead, with his head forwards,The woman muſt be ſpeedily helped. and that there is no hope at all of the womans deliuery without helpe, and that her ſtrength begins manifeſtly 
 to decay: the ſureſt way is to apply the hand. And then the Chirurgion ſhall thruſt gently his left hand beeing wide opened, betweene the childs head, and the necke of the wombe: and with his right hand he muſt put between the ſaid head, and flat of the hand, an Iron Crochet, ſuch a one as you ſee heere figured vnto you.
                     
                        The figure or portaict of the Crochet, wherewith the dead childe may bee drawn forth of his mothers belly, when hee comes with his head forward: the which is ſo lock'd within the os pubis, that it cannot be diſplaced or puſht vpward, to turne and draw foorth the child by the feete, without much hurting the Mother, and often endaungering her life. It will likewiſe ſerue to take forth a head, that remaines alone in the wombe: It muſt be ten or twelue inches long, ſtrong, and thicke, and large enough to take holde.
                     
                     Which muſt bee faſtned to the ſide of the childs head, as about his eare, or bone of the Temples, or in ſome other place if it may bee done

conueniently, as within the hollow of the eye, or the hinder bone of his head, the Chirurgion keeping his left hand in the ſame place where he put it firſt, and therewith he ſhall wagge and ſtirre gently the childs head:Skill in drawing forth the child. and at that very inſtant, with his right hand wherin he holds the crochet, ſo faſtned, in any part of the head, muſt he draw and bring out the child: bidding the woman ſtriue and force her ſelfe, as though ſhe would be deliuered alone. And it is to be noted, that the Chirurgion muſt take his time, to draw him forth, when the woman falls into throws, for while the throws continue, the child ſlides forth the eaſier.
                     Oftentimes it chaunceth, that the Crochet cannot be put high enough at the firſt, to draw foorth the head all at once,Obſeruation in vſing the Crochet. ſo that after it is come forward and drawne out in part, they are faine to take away the Crochet, from the place where it was firſt faſtned, and put it in againe to take new hold higher in another place, which the Chirurgion may doe very fitly, as it hath beene ſhewed already. Likewiſe, if the Crochet be not well, and ſurely faſtned at firſt but that it ſlip, and loſe the firſt hold, then it will bee needfull, to faſten, and put it in a ſurer place.
                     
                        The child may be ſurely drawne out by the ſhoulders.Hauing drawne forth the head, and the Crochet beeing taken out, the Chirurgion ſhall ſlide in his fingers, very cunningly vnder the childs armepits, that he may draw forth the ſhoulders, and the reſt of his body, for by this meanes hee ſhall bee eaſier drawne out then by the head: which muſt be done

very leaſurely, without any violence, giuing the woman leaue to gather her ſtrength, and expecting till her throws come vpon her.
                     While the Chirurgion is about this worke, they muſt giue the poore Woman, a little wine, or elſe let her ſucke a toſt ſop't in wine, or Hippocras: perſwading and incouraging her, that ſhe ſhall quickly be deliuered.
                     This manner of drawing the dead child out of the mothers womb, is ſafer, and ſpeedier,Safe way to draw the child by the feete. then that which is vſed by turning and putting backe the childs head, to finde his feete, and ſo pull him out thereby. For whenſoeuer the childs heade is much entred within the os Pubis it is impoſſible to thruſt him vpward,Inconueniences to turne the child. and turne him without much indaungering the Mother: and cauſing great contuſion in the wombe, from whence proceeds diuers accidents, and ſometime death, as I haue ſeene it often happen.
                     I know ſome will alledge, that they haue taken foorth children aliue, which were thought to haue beene dead, in the Mothers wombe, with the ſaide Crochet: and that they haue preſently died, onely with the hurt they receiued by the Crochet, and certainely this is a cruell kind of practize. Whereto I anſwere, that we muſt diligently looke, and conſider, whether the child be aliue or dead, before wee put in the Crochet,Conſiderations in vſing the Crochet. and if there be any appearance of life, wee muſt deferre the taking of him foorth therewith, as long as we may: But being dead, I ſee no reaſon but wee ſhould take the child forth; with

the ſaid Crochet for the cauſes heeretofore mentioned.Queſtiō whether the Crochet may bee vſed. But if the child be aliue, it is a great queſtion whether he ought to be puld forth by the Crochet, preſuppoſing that the Mother, hauing loſt her ſtrength, is ready to dye, except this meanes bee vſed: it beeing more expedient to looſe the Mother then the child, who would both dye, if that were deferred any longer: and whether to ſaue the Mother, (who is more deare, then the ſaide child) this practize may be ventured. But as I thinke, there are none, that goe about this buſineſſe, but with ſome touch of Conſcience, which being a point of Diuinity, I leaue to be decided by them, that are more conuerſant therein, then my ſelfe.
                  
                  
                     The meanes to draw forth a child, that is ſwollen, and puft vp: in his mothers womb, together with the manner of drawing the head, when it ſtayes behind. CHAP. XIIII.
                     
                     IF the dead child continue long in the mothers wombe,The dead child ſwels and is puft vp. he may eaſily be putrified, and not onely his head, breaſt and nether belly, ſwolne and fild with wind, and water, but likewiſe his legges and feet will be puft vp.
                     This ſwelling, and puffing vp, may alſo happen through all the childs body,The child that is aliue may likewiſe be ſwolne. though he be aliue, hauing eyther the Hydro cephale, or ſwelling of the head, or the dropſie, either of the lungs, or belly:

or elſe beeing Leucophilegmaticall. This accident happening when the child is aliue, hee muſt be helped as being aliue, not deliuering the Woman to the childs loſſe. But if he be dead, and ye perceiue 
 that his head, breſt, or nether belly is ſwoln, or fil'd with wind, or wateriſh matter, then the Chirurgion muſt put vp his hand carrying in the hollowneſſe of it a little crooked knife, very ſharp, made after this faſhion, &amp; with the ſaide knife hee ſhall deuide, and cut the part wherein the wind and water ſhall bee incloſed, (whether it bee the head, breaſt, or belly) which beeing let foorth, the childe will grow leſſe, and afterwards, hee may the more eaſily be taken out.
                     
                        The forme of the Knife to deuide the ſwolne part, which muſt be of this bigneſse heere deſcribed, that it may the better be carried, within ones hand to the place that muſt bee cut or open'd, whether it be the head, breaſt, or belly.
                     
                     It may ſo happen, that the childs arme comming formoſt through the long ſtay it makes without, as alſo becauſe it hath been pul'd by violence,

will be ſwolne, yea, and euen gangren'd, that it cannot poſſibly be thruſt backe againe, that the child may be drawen foorth by the feet: If it fall out to be ſo, then the arme muſt be pul'd out, as far as it can, and if it may be done conueniently, let it be cut off at the ioint of the ſhoulder, or elſe as neere vnto it, as may be; the bone ſhall be cut off with ſharpe cutting pincers, or elſe ſawed off verie euen, the skin and muſcles being put aſide, that ſo the bone may be couer'd, with the ſaid fleſh, muſcle, and skin, which will fall ouer it; and alſo, that the bone, through his roughneſſe, and hardneſſe, may not hurt the ſides of the wombe, the ſtumpe that was cut, or ſawed being put backe againe.
                     Sometime the childs head will not follow the bodie, either becauſe of the bigneſſe thereof, or elſe, becauſe the child is ill turn'd, that in drawing him foorth, he chances to haue his belly, ſtomacke, and face lying vpward: which cauſeth, that the bodie being wholy come foorth, while they would alſo draw foorth the head, the chin takes hold of the Os pubis, and being pul'd violently, the bodie onely is drawen, and the head not moued, ſticketh faſt.
                     For the remedying whereof, that the head ſtay not behind: the bodie muſt be gently turn'd, placing the face downward: (as we ſaid before,) for by this ſituation, the head being moued vp and downe, will be eaſily drawen foorth with the reſt of the bodie; by holding the bodie with one hand,

and putting a finger of the other hand into the childs mouth.
                     And when the head ſtickes, the Chirurgion muſt thruſt his left hand into the wombe, and put his fore finger into the childs mouth, to ſtay the head, which by reaſon of the roundneſſe of it, and moiſture of the wombe, roules and ſlideth vp and downe, not being eaſilie ſtaied; then with his right hand, let him put in the Crochet, which muſt be hook't or faſtned, either in the temples, hole of the eare, hollow of the eye, or elſe in the mouth; and then let him draw the head gently, both with the Crochet, and alſo with the left hand, hauing his fore-finger in the childs mouth, and ſo bring him foorth as cunningly as he can: taking his time alwaies when the Mother is in ſome paine, that ſo the child may be the eaſier drawen foorth.

                        BEing now to ſpeake of Births that are contrarie to nature, we will begin firſt with the Head, as being the worthieſt, and moſt notable part of all the bodie. Sometimes the child comes (as he doth naturally) with the head formoſt, but it is placed amiſſe, which

may be after foure ſeuerall faſhions;In how many faſhions the head may be placed. either the head lying vpon the backe: or vpon the ſtomacke: or elſe vpon the edge of the ſhoulders, inclining towards one of the Mothers flanckes, which makes that the child cannot come foorth ſtraight, and in a direct line: becauſe his necke is bow'd, and ſtands awrie. He being thus turn'd, it is verie hard, yea, euen impoſſible, that the Mother ſhould be deliuer'd, either through any indeauour of the childs thruſting his feet againſt the bottome of the Matrice: nor by any labour of the woman, forcing likewiſe and ſtraining her ſelfe, as much as ſhe can poſſibly, by holding in her breath. But contrariwiſe, the more the child ſtriues to come foorth,When the Mother &amp; the child ſtriue in vaine. and inioy the outward ayre, the more he intangles and wreath's his necke, ſo that at laſt, both his ſtrength, and the Mothers, are together much weakned, through the paine they both ſuffer; the child being in danger, by reaſon of the great compreſſion that muſt needs follow the wreathing of his necke, and alſo by the hindrance of reſpiration,How the child breaths. though he breaths onely as yet by the Arteries of his Mother, vntill the after-burthen be looſened, for then he takes breath at his owne mouth. The Marrow alſo of the backe, and the ſinewes (being the inſtruments of motion) may thereby be ſo preſſed together, that the animal ſpirits may be intercepted, which depriueth the child of all motion, and conſequently of life: wherefore, it will be verie neceſſarie to help him ſpeedily, which ought to be done in this ſort. Firſt, let the Mother be placed,

and held after the ſame order we preſcribed for the helping of them, that are troubled with a great Flux of bloud. Then the Chirurgion, hauing his hands annointed (as we ſaid before) ſhall put vp his right hand, being open, as gently as he can poſſibly,How to find which way the childs head leaneth. to find on which ſide the head doth leane, and is turn'd: if the childs head lean vpon his breaſt, his hand will meet firſt with the backe; if it be turned toward the backe, then he ſhall light vpon the breaſt: or if the head leane vpon one of the ſhoulders, then he ſhall find the other firſt, which will alſo be inclining ſomewhat toward the womans flancks; which when he hath found, before he go about to remoue the head, and bring it into his naturall ſituation, which is to place it directly ouer againſt the necke of the Matrice, he muſt firſt with the ends of his fingers, thruſt vpward the bodie of the child, either by the ſhoulders, or backe, or by the breaſt: for by this meanes the head of the child, will not leane ſo hard againſt the ſides of the wombe:Way to bring the head ſtraight. ſo that his necke will euen come of it ſelfe to the right place. And for the better help, the Chirurgion at the ſame inſtant ſhal ſlide in his other hand, (yet not taking out the former) wherewith finding the place where the head doth reſt, and leane: he may eaſily draw his hand towards the ſide of the childs head, and ſo ſhall he bring it gently to the naturall place: and by this meanes, the childs head will reſt betweene his hands, to be ſet right. The like alſo may he do, by putting his hand gently, toward the hinder part of

the head, and ſo ſet it right, hauing firſt thruſt the child vpward, either by the backe, or breaſt: the which is ſeldome done,Another way. becauſe it is a ſurer and readier way, to thruſt him vp by the ſhoulders: and to ſay the truth, the childs head is oftner turned, toward the Mothers flancks, then either toward her belly, or her backe.

                        THe child ſhould come into the world, with his head forward, and if there be any thing that comes with it, it is contrarie to nature. If the hand, and arme, offer themſelues, and come foorth of the wombe, this trauaile is contrarie to nature, and therefore dangerous: becauſe the arme takes vp the roome,The hand comming foorth, hinders the deliuerie. the head ſhould haue, &amp; hinders it from comming right; according as it is turned, either to the right ſide, or to the left; or elſe vpward; the head leaning vpon the backe: or downward, being placed vpon the breaſt: (as we ſhew'd in the laſt Chapter, when the necke ſtands awrie,) which vnleſſe it be help'd in time, it will be verie hard for him to come ſafe into the world. For the hand, and arme, comming foorth, by reaſon of their tenderneſſe, and ſoftneſſe, being neuer ſo little cruſh'd, or held in the ayre:

they are quickly alter'd, and ſpoil'd, and will be ſwolne, and puft vp exceedingly: yea, and ſometime fall into a Gangrene,The arme comming foorth, fals into a Gangrene. which I haue often ſeen come to paſſe: and therefore it will be verie neceſſarie to redreſſe it ſpeedily.
                     But eſpecially, the Chirurgion muſt take heed of pulling the ſaid hand, or arme; becauſe it is impoſſible,Inconuenience of drawing the child by the arme. he ſhould draw him out thereby: For how much the more the arme is thruſt, whether it be by the Mothers, or the childs ſtriuing, or elſe by the Chirurgion, who labours to pull it out: ſo much the more will it make the head and necke to bow, and bend; either toward the ſtomacke, backe, or ſides: it being impoſſible that the head and arme ſhould come foorth both together, becauſe the ſaid head is ſo infolded, and ingaged, in one of the ſaid places: and therefore this order muſt be obſerued heerein.
                     
                        The practize.Firſt, the Mother muſt be laid vpon her backe, her head and necke lying ſomewhat low, and her hips ſomewhat raiſed: then the Chirurgion, hauing his hands oil'd (as before) ſhall annoint, all the womans parts with that hand, which is moſt fit, according to the diners ſituation of the child. If the hand onely come foorth, he ſhall take it, at the top of the wriſt, and ſo thruſt it backe, as high as he can, guiding it all along the ſides and flancks of the child: and hauing plac'd it there, he muſt pull backe his hand to giue place to the childs head, which at the ſame inſtant, with his other hand, muſt be brought and put, right againſt the necke

of the wombe: And the better to ſet it aright, he muſt with both his hands being ſpred abroad, and placed on each ſide the head, thruſt the ſhouldert vpward, with the ends of his fingers, (as we ſhew'd in the former Chapter) that the childs head may be ſet in the mid'ſt: which will be eaſie for him to do, in taking the childs temples of his head, betweene both his hands, and by that meanes ſet it ſtraight. And when this is done,The woman muſt be hartned. let him ſuffer the woman to reſt her ſelfe a little, aſſuring her, that her child is well plac'd, and that by and by, he will come naturally into the world: The reſt ſhall be performed, as we haue ſhew'd in the naturall Deliuerie; placing the woman after the ſame order, as hath been ſaid. But if it chance, that the child be dead, and that the arme be gangren'd, and ſo ſwolne, that it cannot be put backe, then muſt it be help'd in the ſame manner as we haue ſhewed before, which ought to be done with all ſpeed: for feare of the putrifaction, that may happen vnto it.
                  
                  
                     The meanes to help the trauaile, wherein the Child comes with both his hands, armes, and head formoſt. CHAP. XVII.
                     
                     
                        MAny men are of opinion,Comparing of the two ſorts of deliueries. that the trauaile wherein the child puts formoſt both his hands, and armes, is not ſo dangerous, and difficult, as the former, when there is but one: Becauſe

cauſe when both the armes come, thus ſtretched out, the head is found iuſt in the mid'ſt of the paſſage. 
                           depiction of child in womb
                         But ſince that both armes muſt be put backe againe, as in the former, before the child can come into the world, (it being verie hard, and dangerous to draw him foorth by the armes) it hath made me alwaies thinke, that this kind of deliuerie is more troubleſome and dangerous, then the former.
                     
                        The deliuery where both armes come formoſt is not ſo dangerous.Notwithſtanding this may bee ſaid to bee leſſe dangerous for the child, becauſe howſoeuer hee ſtriue to come forth, and for all the throws that the Woman can haue, yet the child cannot wreath or turne his necke aſide. But yet to ſay the truth, it is

more troubleſome, both for the Mother, and the Chirurgion, yea; and ſometimes for the childe alſo.
                     But the beſt way to proceed heerein is,The practiſe. that the Chirurgion, after he hath placed the woman (as is aforeſaid) hauing his hands annointed, as alſo the parts of the Woman, he ſhall gently put in his right hand, and bring one of the childs armes to his due place, by ſtretching it out at length, along by the flankes and thighs; and preſently with drawing that hand, he ſhall thruſt in his left, to bring the other arme into his place, as he did the former. This being done, he ſhall marke, whether the head of the child be placed right, in the meane time ſuffering the woman to take ſome eaſe, not holding her ſo much backe, as when hee placed the armes of the child. Then ſhall he place her, as in a naturall birth, but if hee find that the head of the child be turned aſide, and be not ſet direct againſt the paſſage, as it vſeth to be in a naturall birth, then ſhall he gently put in both his hands ioyned together, and preſently opening them, he ſhall touch onely with the ends of his fingers, both the ſhoulders of the child, and put him backe eaſily toward the bottom of the Matrice: and beeing ſo put backe, the head of the child will come betweene his hands, which he ſhal eaſily place aright againſt the paſſage (as is aforeſaid) by taking both ſides of his head, or temples betweene his hands, and ſo the deliuery ſhall be performed naturally.
                  
                  
                     
                     The meanes to helpe the mother when the child comes with one, or both feete formost. CHAP. XVIII.
                     
                     
                        WHenſoeuer the child, comming into the World, doth put one or both his feete formoſt, the Chirurgion ſhall place the Woman (as it hath beene oftentimes told,) &amp; hauing his hands annointed, let him chuſe whether he will draw the child forth by the feete: or elſe if he thinke it better, to put backe either one or both the feete, and ſo turne him, and bring his head ſtraight to his paſſage. For my part, I thinke it the better &amp; ſafer way to draw him foorth by the feete, then to turne him vpſide downe, and lift his feete vpward, thereby to bring his head downward to the paſſage. And therfore,What muſt be obſerued concerning the child. whether he come with one, or both his feete forward, the greateſt care muſt be to know how his whole body is placed, &amp; lyes in his Mothers womb: as whether his face and belly be turned toward the mothers backe, and his ſhoulders, backe, and buttocks towards her Nauell: likewiſe whether his armes bee ſeparated from his thighs, flankes, and ſides, which ought alſo to be diligently obſerued in all births that are contrary to Nature, eſpecially, in thoſe, when the child is drawne forth by the feete: For when you draw him out of the wombe,

with his buttockes, backe, and hinder parts of the head, turned toward the backe of the Mother, and his face toward her Nauell, and belly, then without doubt the feet, buttocks, body and ſhoulders, of the child being drawn forth, when the head commeth to the os pubis, it will hang therein: which beeing ſo catched it will be very hard, nay impoſſible, to draw forth the child: and if you draw him too violently, it is to be feared leaſt you breake his necke, eſpecially if the child be too big, or his head great. Therefore when you haue drawne him by the feete till he is come forth, as farre as the buttocks, and waſt, before you draw him any further, you muſt marke diligently the poſition of the body, whether the belly breſt, and face, be vpward, or no. For if he be ſo placed, before you draw him any further, you muſt turne him vpſide downe, which you ſhall performe, if you hold him faſt by the buttockes, and hips, with both your hands, and turn the whole body (withall drawing it gently) and ſo bring the belly, breaſt, and face downeward, which being done, you ſhall draw him forth with eaſe, without daunger of ſtaying, or carrying the head vpon os pubis: which muſt needs happen, if the child were drawne with the face vpwards. And this haue I well obſerued, being called to the deliuery of ſome women, where this chance, (for want of good heed taking) hath happened, the head ſticking within, and putting vs to great trouble, to draw it foorth. Beſide,An obſeruation when the two arms are ſtretched out. when the body is thus ſituated, if both the armes be ſtretched out aboue the head, you ſhall bring

downe one of them cloſe to the ſide, and let the other ſtay ſtretched out, that when the ſhoulders, are come foorth, the ſaid arme may be as it were a ſtay, or ſplint to the necke, for the paſſage of the head, to hinder the paſſage from ſhutting or cloſing vp, and faſtning about the necke of the child, and ſo hinder che child from comming foorth, notwithſtanding oftentimes, the child is ſo ſlender and little, that ſo ſoone as the ſhoulders are come out preſently the head follows after, and needeth not, the helpe of an arme, to bee a reſt for the necke.
                     Now the Chirurgion when hee hath thus obſerued, and marked the ſituation of the child, or elſe hauing after that manner put him backe if he find the child may be eaſily turned by lifting his feet vpwards, and bringing his head downeward, he may gently make triall of it.The ſafeſt way is to draw the child forth by the feet. But if he find that there is any difficulty therein, then the beſt and ſureſt way is to draw him forth by the feete. Therfore, if but one of his feet come forth, he ſhall tye a ribband about it, that if it be needfull, to put it backe againe, to ſearch for the other, he may the ſooner find it, and draw it forth. For it were enough to teare the child aſunder, and ſo kill both him and his mother, to draw him forth by one foote. Therefore, whether the firſt foote hang out, or whether it be ſomwhat put backe againe, let it ſerue for a guide to find the other, the Chirurgion putting his hand all along

                        
                           depiction of child in womb: breech birth
                        
the ſaid leg and thigh euen to the Perinaeum,
                        How to find the childs feet neere the which hee ſhall be ſure to find the other thigh, and afterward the leg and foote, (vnleſſe you meet with them firſt, as commonly it fals out). But the ſureſt way is to do it the firſt way (that is to find the thigh firſt) becauſe oftentimes there are two children, which if it ſhould ſo happen then might you

                        
                           depiction of child in womb: breech birth
                        
take one foote of the one, and another foote of the other: and thinking, that they were the feete of one child onely, without doubt in drawing them foorth after that manner, you would kill them both, and put the mother likewiſe in great danger of death, becauſe it would be impoſſible to draw them forth both together. And you muſt obſerue, that to draw a child well out of his Mothers wombe, you muſt haue a Napkin, or ſome other linnen cloth, that you may not hold the child naked,You muſt not hold the child naked. either by the feete, thighs, or other part of the body: but let it be with a warme cloth, for your hands beeing annointed, and greaſie, and the child being alſo moiſt, hee will eaſily ſlip from betweene your hands, and you ſhall

not take ſo ſtrong hold as is fit, for to bring him foorth. And yet it may happen,An Obſeruation. that the inner neck of the Matrice, may not be ſo wide, as to giue way to the Chirurgions, or Midwiues hand, without great difficulty and paine: the paſſage beeing not bigger then to admit two or three fingers, by which neuertheleſſe, it is found in what manner the child commeth. If you obſerue that one foote or both come formoſt, you muſt proceed according to this example.
                     Being at Moret with Count Charles, I was called,A ſtory. together with the late Mons: de la Corde, one of the Kings Phiſitions, to deliuer a poore woman, which had beene in trauaile two daies and two nights: the waters beeing broken, and the child left dry, the necke of her Matrice was cloſed, ſhe being no more vrged with paines or throwes, which I obſerued by ſlipping vp my hand, vnto the ſaid necke, and getting two of my fingers therein, where feeling one of the childs feete, I perſwaded my ſelfe that I ſhould deliuer her well, which I did in this ſort.
                     Firſt, when I had placed her well, I annointed my hands with butter and hogs greaſe melted together, and with ſtore thereof, I annointed the inward necke of the Matrice, as well as poſſibly I could: and when I had ſomewhat dilated the ſaide necke, with three of my fingers I caſt a ryband with a ſliding knot, vppon the childs foote, faſtning it gently: and then dilating againe the ſaid necke, I found out the other foote, vpon which I ſlipped another riband, as I had done vpon the former: Then

did I draw both the ribands, and brought the two feete together, which when I had drawne out, vnto the buttocks, I began againe to annoint, as before, then taking a napkin, leſt it ſhould ſlip, I bad the woman force her ſelfe, as much as ſhee could poſſibly, eſpecially when ſhee felt her paines and throws comming: and then drawing ſometimes directly, and ſometimes to the one ſide, ſo to enlarge the paſſage, I drew on the child gently turning the belly thereof downward; that the chin might not catch in the ospubis, as I haue noted before.
                     Sometimes the child comes not with his feet but

                           depiction of child in womb: breech birth
                        
with his knees forward, and in this caſe, the Chirurgion ſhall vſe the ſame art, as before, conſidering

firſt, whether it be fitter to bring the childs head formoſt, or to draw him out by the feet. If he will draw him out by the feet, he ſhall bring him into the foreſaid ſituation, that is, to let the face of the child be turn'd toward the Mothers backe, and his backe, toward her Nauell: then ſhall he vnfold, or vnlooſe the legs, that were bow'd and bent; and ſhall draw them foorth firſt, and then the reſt of the bodie, in this ſort.How to draw him foorth. He ſhall ſlide his hand from the knee of the child, along the ſhine, till he come to the foote, which he ſhall draw foorth, and tye a ſmall ryband about it, and put that foot in againe, letting the ryband hang out: The like ſhall he doe to the other foot, and ſo ſhall he eaſily draw out the two feet. Then let him draw foorth the thighs, and buttockes, and if the child lie with his belly, breaſt, and face downward, and his buttockes, backe, and ſhoulders vpward; let him inſtantly, draw gently out the reſt of the child, (as we haue ſaid before.) But if he be placed contrariwiſe,The child muſt be turned. he muſt turne him gently, the face downward, leaſt otherwiſe the head take hold vpon the Ospubis, by the chin, as we haue ſaid before.
                     I haue often repeated, this faſhion of drawing out the child, for feare leaſt the young Chirurgion erre, in performing it otherwiſe; which if he ſhould doe, he will be much troubled in drawing out the head, which may ſticke by the way, as I haue ſeen it happen.

faſhions: as (beſide thoſe that haue been ſpoken of,) with both the feet and hands formoſt; the buttocks, backe, and head of the child, being ſo bent, and bow'd againſt the bottome of the Matrice, which doth preſſe, and thruſt him downward, that the ſaid hands and feet,A terrible kind of deliuerie. come foorth with ſuch violence, that it is a fearefull thing to ſee, and full of danger, becauſe of the difficultie to remedie it; the Matrice bearing downe it ſelfe in ſuch ſort, and to no vſe; it being impoſſible, that the child ſhould be borne, whil'ſt he is thus ſituated. And therefore it will be neceſſarie in this caſe, to giue help with as much ſpeed, as may be: The practize whereof is in this manner.
                     Firſt, you ſhall place the woman as we haue ſaid before,Meanes to helpe the trauaile. then the Chirurgion hauing his hands annointed, as is required: if the child be aliue, he ſhall trie firſt with his right hand to put the feet into the Matrice, making them ſlip vp, as eaſily as he can to the bottome of the ſaid Matrice, and with his left hand, ſhall he ſtay the hands that they come not foorth further: the feet being thus thruſt backe, preſently, he ſhall either put one of his fingers, into the childs mouth, or elſe take him by the hinder part of the head, to bring it direct againſt the paſſage: in the meane time putting backe with his left hand, the childs hands and armes, that they may fall cloſe to his ſides: then taking the head between the palmes of his hands, he ſhall place it iuſt againſt the paſſage. Which being done, the birth will ſucceed naturally, both by the help and ſtriuing of

the child, and alſo by the indeuour of the Mother, when ſhe feeles her throwes come vpon her.
                     
                        A ſurer way to draw forth the child.But when the Chirurgion ſhall find, that the feet, legs, and hands, cannot be put backe, and that the Matrice doth beare downeward, and ſhut it ſelfe not ſuffering the feet to ſlip vp, then muſt he, with all the Art he can, put back with his left hand, the childs hands, and with his right hand draw the feete gently, taking heede that the childs face and belly may bee downeward, and ſo draw out the child, as hath beene ſhewed before.
                     Likewiſe if the Chirurgion find that the child be dead, he muſt draw him forth by the feete, without troubling himſelfe to bring the head of the child, to the paſſage. For euery dead child, becauſe he is not able to giue any helpe to the birth, but that all the labour is to come from the Mother, is oftentimes the cauſe of her death. And therfore the ſureſt way is to turne him ſo, that he may be drawn but by the feete, or elſe with the Crochet.
                     
                        The Authors opinion.As for my ſelfe, I am of this opinion, that it is better, whether the child be dead or aliue, (if he come with his feete, and hands formoſt) that the Chirurgion bring him foorth by the feete, then to turne him, and bring his head formoſt, and ſo expect a naturall birth: for in this ſtriuing, the Mother hauing been much wearied, and the chid much weakned, the deliuerie (though it be naturall) will proue verie long, and difficult, in regard that neither the Mother, nor the child, can haue much ſtrength left them: Whereas if you draw him foorth by the

feet, neither the Mother, nor the child being much weakned, the birth will be more eaſie, and fortunate; As I haue alwaies had experience.

                        BEſide the former deliuerie, which is, when the child comes double, putting his hands and feet formoſt: there likewiſe happen diuers other births that are no leſſe difficult, and

dangerous: For when he comes ſide-long, with his Sides, Backe, or Shoulders next the paſſage, his feet muſt needs be on the one ſide of the Matrice, and his head on the other, lying quite croſſe; ſo that the child, beating on both ſides, with his head and feet againſt the wombe, doth extend, and ſtretch it to no purpoſe, wherby the Mother growes weake and faint: which neither ſhe, nor the child can long indure without danger of death; becauſe his ſtriuing helps not at all for his comming foorth.
                     
                        depiction of child in womb: transverse presentation
                     
                     
                        A dangerous ſituation.The like may happen, when the child puts out his thighs, and buttocks formoſt: which kind of birth is verie painefull and difficult, becauſe the child

fils all the Matrice: Which the Chirurgion perceiuing, he ſhall conſider, whether it be better, to turne the child, and bring formoſt his head, or elſe his feet: if he can eaſily bring the childs head vnto the paſſage, he ſhall proceed in this ſort.
                     Firſt, he ſhall put in his right hand (being annointed as before) to turne the child, and hauing found the ſhoulder, with the palme of his ſaid hand, he ſhall lift the child vpward, that his feet or knees may be toward the bottome of the Matrice, whil'ſt the head fals and ſlides downward: and ſhall hold it faſt at the orifice of the wombe, with his left hand, being put in at the ſame inſtant; and by this meanes ſhall bring the Armes cloſe to the thighs, and ſides of the child that the Woman may be naturally deliuered. But if the Chirurgion finde any difficulty, to lift the body vpward, for the bringing of the head downward: then ſhall he ſlide his right hand vnder the childs armepit, and ſo draw him gently, yet not making the arme come foorth, to place the head right againſt the paſſage.
                     But if the Chirurgion find any hindrance in bringing the head downeward, and that hee thinkes he can more eaſily guide and bring the feete to the orifice of the wombe, then the beſt and ſureſt way is to draw him foorth in that ſort, by the feete: and certainly when the child comes with his buttocks formoſt, his head being vpward, then may you ſooner meete with his feete, and bring them eaſier to the orifice of the Matrice, to bee drawne foorth as wee haue ſhewed before. But when hee puts his

ſhoulder or backe formoſt, then may you the more eaſily lift him vp to make his head ſlip downeward, or elſe take him by the Armepit, and ſo bring gently his head to the necke of the wombe, to deliuer him naturally.

                        THe moſt troubleſome, and painfull ſituation of a childe in his mothers wombe, is when he comes with his belly formoſt, putting out his nauell, his legges and armes being turned backwards. For when hee is placed in this manner, and ſtriues to come foorth, hee thruſts againſt the ſides of the Wombe with his hands and feet, and ſo boweth backward, and bends the backe bone that hee brings himſelfe as it were into a circle, whereby hee endur's and ſuffers much paine, and likewiſe is weakned exceeding much, vnleſſe hee be ſpeedily helpt: and beſides, by his compreſſion and ſtriuing, hee cauſeth the Mother to endure much paine, and anguiſh without any profite at all both which doth require to be ſpeedily redreſſed, which maybe performed in this ſort. Firſt the Chirurgiō

ſhal place the woman in good order (as hath beene ſaid)Meanes to help the child. and then ſhall he ſlide vp his right hand (beeing firſt annointed) to obſerue and feele what part of the childs body is neereſt, which hee ſhall perceiue both by his feeling, and by wagging and ſtirring the child vp and downe: If the breaſt be

next, he ſhall take with the ſaid hand) the child by he ſhoulders and top of the Arme, bringing him thereby gently downeward, afterward lifting vp his hand, that the childs head may fall right towards the paſſage, putting in preſently his left hand to receiue and ſet ſtraight the childs head, which may be turned on the one ſide, and that being done, the deliuery ſhall bee afterwards performed Naturally.
                     
                        Another conſideration.But if the head cannot be eaſily brought downward, or that the belly and top of the thigh be neerer vnto the paſſage, then the Chirurgion ſhall put his right hand along the childs thigh to find one of his feete, which being found, hee ſhall caſt about it a riband, with a ſliding knot, and then ſhall he ſeeke for the other, and bring them both gently to the paſſage, and ſo draw him forth by the feete, taking hold of him with a warm napkin, between both his hands: obſeruing alwaies that his face and belly be downewards; for feare leaſt when the ſhoulders are come forth, the chinne catch vpon the os pubis, as we haue ſhewne more at large, in the chapter of deliuering the childe with the feete formoſt, to which place I referre you, ſhunning often repetition.

                     IT cannot well bee perceiued alwaies, whether a woman beares two children, though ſhe be in

trauaile: for I my ſelfe was preſent not long ſince, at the deliuery of an honeſt woman,One may bee ſafely deliuered of two children. who brought two children: and when ſhe was deliuered of the firſt, the Midwife (not expecting that there was a ſecond) was ready to draw out the after burthen, but that I perceiued another offer it ſelfe at the paſſage, which as it came naturally, ſo was ſhee deliuered thereof very fortunately. But if it ſo fall out that the twins do come, the one with his head, the other with his heeles formoſt, then the Chirurgion ſhall behaue himſelfe in this ſort.
                     
                        How he muſt deliuer the woman when the twins come ill.Firſt he ſhall conſider, which of the two children the woman may be eaſieſt deliuered of. If the head of the one come not ſo forward, as the feete of the other: it will be eaſie to draw foorth that child by the feete, putting the others head a little aſide, and when he hath brought that foorth, he muſt preſently ſet the head of the other right againſt the paſſage, and incourage the woman to bee deliuered, which will the eaſier bee done, becauſe the other hath prepared the way.
                     And if it happen, that in deliuering the firſt by the feete, the ſecond ſhould change his ſituation; then the Chirurgion ſhall looke after the feet, and draw him foorth, as he did, the former. And when the head of the firſt, is very forward: then ſhall hee thruſt backe the feete of the ſecond, to giue way to the others head, that he may come naturally.
                     
                        The way to deliuer a woman of two twins.If the heads of both the children come together to the paſſage, the Chirurgion muſt take great care for it is impoſſible for him to make them come

foorth both at once, (except they be very little.) And therefore hee ſhall put vp his hand to try, whether both the heads are placed in one, and the ſame line, and point of diſtance (as commonly it happens) or elſe whether the one is further forward then the other: And eſpecially hee muſt obſerue whether the two children be monſters, and vnnaturall, or no. As whether there be two heads vpon one body: or if they be ioyned together, either by the backe or by the belly, as it is often ſeene; which he may eaſily perceiue, by ſliding his right hand open, betweene the two heads, putting it as high as he can, to feele the diuiſion; and then drawing his hand down againe gently between the two heads, hee ſhall thruſt aſide the one to giue place to the other, which hee muſt bring right to the paſſage, leauing the ſecond neuertheleſſe in his naturall ſituation. And when the woman feeles her throws come vpon her, then ſhall he by all meanes bring forward, the former that he would receiue, holding downe the other, with two or three fingers of his left hand (leaſt he ſhould offer to come foorth) and ſhall endeuour onely to bring the firſt into the world. Which beeing done; if the ſecond bee not well ſituated, he ſhall bring the head forward right to the necke of the Matrice, and being brought thither, he may eaſily come foorth, becauſe the way hath beene prepared, and made ready by the former. But you muſt obſerue, that the firſt beeing come foorth, hee muſt be taken from betweene his mothers legges, for feare leaſt he indanger his life;

but you muſt firſt tye the nauell,His Nauell muſt be tyed. as we haue ſhewed. And beſides it will be very neceſſary and fitte before it be cut, to tye the reſt of the nauell ſtring, that is faſtned to the after-burthen with a large and ſtrong thred, that it may therby be the eaſier found and drawne foorth afterwards. For the thred that binds the Nauell, being left too ſhort it may ſlippe into the womb, and thereby much trouble the mother: When the ſecond child is come foorth, the Chirurgion muſt ſearch whether there bee two after-burthens, or no. And if it happen that after the ſecond deliuery, the two after-burthens ſhould not come away ſo ſoone as they ought:The afterburthen muſt bee taken away ſpeedily. then muſt they bee prouoked for feare leaſt the Matrice beeing emptied of two children, might chaunce to ſinke downe, and ſhut it ſelfe cloſe together, thereby as it were to retain the ſaid after-burthens, and by this meanes hinder the deliuery of them, which muſt be remedied, as wee haue ſhewed before. If the two children ſhould haue but one body, I am of opinion that for the performing of this deliuery, it would be a more eaſie and ſafe way, to turne the head vpward, and draw him foorth by the feete, than to make him come foorth with the head formoſt hauing an eſpeciall care, when he comes foorth as far as the buttocks, that you guide and draw them foorth with all the Art you can poſſibly: at which kind of deliuery, I my ſelfe was neuer preſent.

                        depiction of twins in womb
                     
                     
                        AS two twins may chance to offer themſelues with their heads, ſo likewiſe ſometimes they may happpen to come with their feete formoſt.
                     When this chaunceth, the Chirurgion ought to obſerue, whether the twins be ſeparated, (as wee ſaid before) or whether they be vnnaturall, as hauing

foure legs, one or two bodies, and likewiſe one or two heads. Now the beſt way to find it is, that the Chirurgion hauing his hand annointed (as before) ſlip it vp gently wide open,Meanes to know whether the child be a monſter or no. as high as he can, and finding that the twins are not ioyned together, but diuided and diſtinguiſhed, he ſhall bring down his hand betweene one of their thighs, and pulling it a little lower, ſhall take hold of one of the twins feet, (that which he thinks may bee eaſieſt drawne foorth) and tye about it a riband, with a ſliding knot, towards the Ankle: then ſhall he put his hand along the ſaid legge, and ſo euen to the buttockes that thereby hee may find the other legge of the ſame child, and ioyne them together, and not bee miſtaken (taking one legge of the one twinne, and another of the other: For if he ſhould doe ſo, then without doubt in drawing of them forth, he would teare them both aſunder:) but beeing certaine by this meanes, that both the legges and feete, bee of the ſame child, you may draw them foorth gently, (as wee haue ſhewed before) taking care that the childe come with his face downeward.Whē the firſt is come hee muſt be taken away. When you haue thus drawne foorth the firſt, you ſhall in the ſame manner, proceed to the ſecond: hauing firſt taken away (as is ſaide before) the other, from betweene the mothers legges. And if it happen that one of the twins come naturally, with his head formoſt, and the other with his feete: and that his feet are more forward then the others head: then the ſafeſt way will be to draw him foorth firſt, that hath his feete formoſt: hauing firſt of all put the other aſide

that offered himſelfe at the paſſage. But if the head of the one be right againſt the paſſage and the feet of the other on the one ſide, then ſhall hee put backe the feete gently, and deliuer the woman firſt of him that had his head formoſt, and afterwards draw the other foorth by the feete.
                     It may alſo happen in each of the former births,It muſt be knowen which is aliue. that one of the twins may be dead, and the other liuing. Howſoeuer they are placed, the Chirurgion muſt be very certaine which of them is dead, or aliue.The meanes to know it. Which hee ſhall know by feeling them about the Nauell, Temples, or region of the Heart, Handwriſts, or Ankles, where if he find no pulſe, or beating of the Arteries, then he may be ſure that the child is dead, as alſo if he be leſſe hot then the other: and when you put your finger into his mouth, he neither ſucke it, nor wag his tongue. But if you find all theſe ſignes concurre,How you muſt draw him out. then there is ſome likelyhood that he is aliue: and therefore it will be beſt to bring his head right againſt the paſſage, that ſo the woman may be the ſooner deliuer'd, which will be done the more eaſily, becauſe the liue child can better help himſelfe, then he that is dead. But if the Chirurgion thinke, that he ſhall hardly bring the head to the ſaid paſſage, and that he find the feet are neerer, and readier; then I would aduiſe him to bring the child foorth by the feet, and when the woman ſhall be deliuer'd of th'one, let him draw foorth th'other in the ſame faſhion.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of the ſtaying of the after-burthen, after the deliuerie. CHAP. XXIIII.
                     
                     
                        OFtentimes it happens, after the woman hath been deliuer'd, whether it be naturally, or by the Chirurgions helpe: that the bed whereupon the child lay, (commonly called the After-burthen) as being a ſecond burthen,The After-burthen may be ſtop't. or deliuerie of the woman; becauſe, when that is come away, the Mother is wholy deliuer'd, doth remaine faſtned to the ſides of the wombe, and cannot verie eaſily be ſeperated from it, and though it be looſened, yet oftentimes it cannot be put foorth: The which may proceed, either from the dryneſſe of the Matrice, and after-burthen,Cauſes of the retention of the after-burthen. being deſtitute of their moiſture, or becauſe, that it is ſwolne, and ſtretch'd, or elſe becauſe the expulſiue facultie of the wombe, hath been much weakned by a long and painfull trauaile: Whereunto may be added, that oftentimes the Mother hath been ſo wearied, and brought ſo low, and become ſo faint, weake, and feeble, that ſhe is not able to ſtraine, or force her ſelfe at all.
                     Now it is moſt certaine, that after the child hath left his Mothers wombe, the ſaid after-birth is a thing contrarie to nature, which muſt needs be taken away and ſent foorth: And therefore one of theſe two accidents muſt needs follow, either that

the quicke (which is the wombe) thruſt foorth the dead, (which is the after-birth:) or that the dead kill the quicke: And ſurely, that being retayned, it doth breed in the Mother, moſt pernicious, and dangerous Symptomes, as ſwounnings, oppreſſion, and ſuffocation: yea, and ſometimes being corrupted and putrified, it is an occaſion of death.
                     For the preuenting whereof, there muſt be great care and diligence vſed in the bringing and drawing of it foorth: which muſt not be done raſhly, but leaſurely, by often ſhaking and mouing it. In the meane time, taking heed that neither the Mother, nor the wombe, take any cold, for feare leſt it be ſodainly clos'd and ſhut vp: and therefore, firſt of all, if the woman be weake, you ſhall giue her, either ſome Broth, Gelly, yelke of an egge, or elſe a toſt and ſuger. And you muſt likewiſe put in practize, that which we haue formerly ſpoken of: as to make her Cough, ſneeze, and blow, in her hands holding ſalt therein: and beſide you muſt giue her medicines, that are proper to expell and driue forth the ſaid after-bith; which are, ſuch as we formerly preſcribed, in Difficult trauaile: as

                        Horatius Augenius reports in his Epiſtles, that he hath made often triall of it, and ſaith, that he had it, of his father, for a ſecret.
                     If the afterbirth comes not away for all the foreſaid medicines, then muſt you come to handyworke: and for that purpoſe the Chirurgion ſhall place the woman in the ſame faſhion he did, in the drawing out of the child: then ſhall he put vp his hand, (annointed as before) holding the Nauellſtring, which will ſerue him for a guide to find the after-birth; and when he hath found it, he ſhall obſerue and trie diligently, whether it ſticks to the ſides of the wombe, or no: If the ſaid after-burthen cannot come foorth, becauſe the paſſage of the Matrice is to ſtraite, it being ſhrunke together, and ſwolne with paine: Then ſhall he vſe medicines that relaxe and mollifie, as the liniments appointed in the naturall deliuerie, and alſo ſuch as ſhall be ſet downe hereafter, together with fomentations and iniections: And when he perceiues that the paſſage is open and free, and that the after-birth ſtaies onely through the womans feebleneſſe and weakneſſe, in theſe two caſes he ſhall draw it foorth gently.
                     But if he perceiue that it doth ſticke to the wombe, and likewiſe finds it ſoft and moiſt, then

ſhall he ſeparate as gently as may bee, with his fingers, (his nayles, being firſt pared very cloſe and euen) from the ſides of the womb, beginning at that end which he thinks, doth beſt cleaue or ſtice therto; and ſo draw it by little and little, ſhaking it ſomtimes, on the one ſide, and ſometimes on the other, not drawing it violently directly forward; for feare (as Hippocrates ſaith) leaſt the Matrice ſhould fall downe and follow the after-birth, whereto as yet it is faſtned: putting ſtill betweene the ſides of the Matrice, and the ſaid part of the after-burthen, eyther freſh butter, or ſome of the liniment wherwith he annoints his hands, that it may helpe by mollifying and relaxing, to ſeparate it the more eaſily.
                     And you muſt take an eſpeciall care that you draw it not foorth ſuddenly all at once, leaſt it ſhould ſticke to many places of the wombe, and ſo you thinking to pull it along, might ſhake &amp; bring down with it the body of the womb, which would cauſe a Praecipitation or falling downe thereof: Or elſe, if you ſhould ſeparate it by violence, ſome veſſell or part of the wombe is in danger to be broken, which may procure a fluxe of bloud, or ſome vlcers, wherof may follow a Gangrene, yea and oftentimes death.

                        Hippocrates to this purpoſe, writes a memorable ſtory of a Carriers wife, who had a peece of her after-birth left behind in the wombe, (that cauſed her to haue the Strangury) which continued there euen till ſhe was deliuered of an other child. For at the end of foure months, ſhe conceiued again and

bore her fruit to the full time: which Hiſtory hath imboldened me to relate this that follows.
                     
                        A true ſtory.
                        Mary Beaurin, yet liuing, Wife vnto William Prat a Glaſier, dwelling in Saint Andrews ſtreet, ſent for me, (it is ſome ſixe and twenty yeare ſince) to ſhew me a tumor that came foorth of her Womb, which was as bigge as ones fiſt, and more; and was like vnto a bladder: as firme and hard, as ſtrong parchment: full of cleare water, wherein one might perceiue a pretty hardneſſe: the ſaid tumor or bladder would ſlip vp eaſily, when ſhee lay vpon her backe, and lifted her thighs a little vpward, cruſhing it a little with her hand, (as they commonly doe when they put backe a rupture) which ſhee did in my preſence, and I demaunding of her how long this accident had troubled her; ſhe told mee it had beene ſo aboue two yeares, and begun at the birth of her ſecond child: and yet notwithſtanding ſhee ſaid ſhe had had a little young daughter, about ſixe Moneths ſince, to which ſhe then gaue ſucke, and that all the time that ſhe went with child, ſhee ſaid this bladder fell not downe at all, as it was wont before her laſt beeing with child. I counſelled her to call Mon. Paraeus the Kings chiefe Chirurgion, and other Chirurgions, to giue their iudgement, what this bladder might be: And perceiuing, when they had handled it, that it was without pain, they were all of opinion after it was drawne foorth, as farre as it could poſſibly, to haue it tyed at the top, and then to pierce it; the which I did; leauing the thred wherewith I tyed it, ſomwhat long, that thereby I

might draw it foorth, when I thought fit. The inciſion being made, there followed great ſtore offaire and cleere water, and preſently we perceiued a little, foeuus or Pantye child of a fingers bigneſſe, ſomwhat firme, and hard; without any bad ſmell, faſtned by the Náuell, which was as firme and big, as a pretty ſtring. About ſixe daies after, with ſhaking the ſaide thred, (which had beene likewiſe gently ſtirred, euery day from one ſide to the other) he reſt came foorth: hauing applied, in the meane time, many mollifying iniections to the wombe, for the looſning of it, from the parts whereto it was faſtned.

And falling ſicke, there paſſed by chaunce, through the rowne where ſhe dwelt, a certaine Mountibancke or Quackſaluer, who made an inciſion in her belly, and therby tooke foorth the bones of the ſaid child, and cured her: And when the time of her trauaile came, ſhee was deliuered of a luſty and healthfull child.

                        IT now remaines onely, that I ſpeake of the laſt kind of deliuerie, which muſt be practized, after the Mothers deceaſe, that thereby the child may be ſaued, and receiue Baptiſme. This birth is called Caeſarian, à caeſo Matris vtero, in imitation of Caeſar, who was rip't out of his Mothers wombe, at the verie inſtant ſhe died. The which ought to be obſerued in euery well gouern'd Common-wealth: For, Iuriſconſulti eum necis damnant,

The Lawiers iudge them worthy of death, who ſhall burie a great bellyed-woman that is dead, before the child be taken foorth, becauſe together with the Mother, they ſeeme to deſtroy the hope of a liuing creature.
                     In ſome women, I haue made this practize verie fortunately, and among the reſt, in Mad. le Maire, Mr Phillippes my vncle being ioined with me: And likewiſe in Mad. Paſquier, preſently after ſhe was dead, Monſieur Paraeus, and the Curate of Sct Andrew, being preſent.
                     But before the Chirurgion come to this worke,What the Chirurgion muſt obſerue. he muſt obſerue diligently, and be certainly aſſured,

that the woman is dead, and that her kinſfolkes, friends, and others that are preſent, do all affirme and confeſſe, that her Soule is departed: And then he muſt come preſently to the handyworke, becauſe the deferring of it, might cauſe the childs death, and ſo make the worke vnprofitable.
                     All the while that the woman lyes in her paine, and Agonie, the Midwife, or elſe ſome other woman, ſhall hold their hand within the necke of the Matrice, to keep it as open, as may be poſſible: for though we know, that while the child is in the Mothers wombe, he breaths onely by her Arteries; yet notwithſtanding, the Aire that may enter therein, doth not onely not hurt, but doth verie much good.
                     Now, to know certainly, and to be aſſured that the woman hath yeelded vp her laſt breath, you ſhall lay vpon her lips,An experiment. and about her noſe, ſome light feathers; for if ſhe breath neuer ſo little, they will flie away.
                     And being thus aſſured that ſhe is dead, the Chirurgion, preſently without any delay, after he hath laid open her belly naked, ſhall there make an inciſion,The Methode of making the inciſion. of the length of foure fingers, neare vnto the right Muſcles, cutting both the skin, and the three Muſcles of the Epigastrium, and the Peretonaeum, piercing euen to the verie capacitie of the belly. Then ſhall he thruſt in two of his fingers, and with them ſhall he lift and hold vp, the ſaid skin, muſcles, and Peretonaeum; and betweene them, he muſt

make a ſufficient inciſion, to diſcouer the Matrice, and the child therein contained, which will eaſily ſhew it ſelfe: Then ſhall he inſtantly make an inciſion, iuſt in the midſt of the wombe, which he ſhal find a finger thicke, and more,The wom

                            is thicke. and therefore he need not be afraid of hurting the child, becauſe I haue alwaies obſeru'd, that the after-birth is ſituated next to that place, and then the child. But if there ſhould be any likelihood,The way t

                            open the wombe. that the ſaid after-birth were looſened, and had changed his place, then muſt he be more circumſpect, and warie: And therefore, he ſhall rather teare and inlarge th'inciſion with two fingers of each hand, being put therein, then cut it, and ſo make the orifice large enough, according as he thinks fit, for the drawing out of the child, which he ſhall take foorth of the wombe. This being done, he ſhall take the after-birth, and lay it vpon the childs belly, cauſing ſome bodie, to take a little wine in their mouth, and ſpirt it into the childs noſe, eares, &amp; mouth, which muſt be done often, as we haue ſhew'd before.

                         may and ought to be practized (the woman being aliue) in a painfull and troubleſome birth: Which for mine owne part, I will not counſell any one to do, hauing twiſe made triall of it my ſelfe, in the preſence of Monſ. Paraeus, and likewiſe ſeen it done by Monſ. Viart, Brunet, and Charbonnet, all excellent Chirurgions, and men of great experience and practize; who omitted nothing, to doe it artificially, and methodically: Neuertheleſſe, of fiue

women, in whom this hath been practized, not one hath eſcaped. I know that it may be alleaged, that there be ſome haue been ſaued therby: But though it ſhould happen ſo, yet ought we rather to admire it, then either practize or imitate it: For, One Swallow makes not a Spring, neither vpon one experiment onely, can one build a ſcience.
                     
                        The Caeſarian Section reproued.After Monſ. Paraeus had cauſed vs to make triall of it, and ſeen that the ſucceſſe was verie lamentable, and vnfortunate: he left of, and diſallowed this kind of practize, together with the whole Colledge of Chirurgions of Paris: as likewiſe the diſcreeter ſort, of the Regent Doctours in the facultie of Phyſicke, at Paris: at ſuch time as this queſtion was ſufficiently diſcuſſed by the late Monſ. Marchant, in the two declamations he made, when he had the honour to be admitted ſworne Chirurgion, of Paris.

                     What diet a Woman muſt keepe that is newly deliuered. CHAP. I.
                     
                     
                        HEeretofore wee haue ſpoken of the care that muſt bee taken of a Woman, ſo ſoone as ſhee is brought a bed, and deliuered of her after-birth: Now wee will treate of the diet ſhee is to keepe, while ſhe lies in, and of the accidents, that may befall her in that time.
                     Firſt ſhee muſt bee kept reaſonable hot: for too much heat doth weaken, and diſſolue the ſtrength:Cold hurts the ſpermaticall parts. but aboue all, ſhe muſt be kept from the cold aire: becauſe it is an enemy to the ſpermaticall parts, and being very piercing it may get into the Matrice

which is now empty, and there procure, great pains and torments, as alſo puffe it vp, and the whole bellie: and therefore the doores, and windows of her chamber in any wiſe are to be kept cloſe ſhut.
                     
                        Dyet.Her dyet muſt be thus: Firſt ſhe muſt liue temperately, and not fill her ſelfe with too much meat: and that muſt bee of the ſame kind, that is preſcribed for them that are wounded; and indeed in ſome women, there happens a great Solutio continui, and not that onely which they call ſimple, but alſo that which hath a contuſion ioyned with it. For in that great ſtriuing, and paſſing of the child, many membranes are not onely bruiſed, and hurt: but alſo broken, and torne: as it hapneth in young women and in others that are farre in yeares, and neuer had any child before. Nay ſometimes in theſe, the paſſage of the Matrice, and that of Anus, are brought into one: yea, and ſome ſuffer great excoriations, and hurts, in thoſe parts; which beeing neglected, in ſome, haue come to putrifaction, and Gangrenes: And heere I muſt admoniſh women in childbed, not to regard the words of their nurſes,The nurſes muſt not bee alwayes harkned to. or keepers, which continually preach to them, to make much of themſelues, ſaying, that they had need to fil their bellies, which haue been ſo much emptyed, telling them how much bloud they haue loſt, and do daily looſe, and that at laſt they will grow ſo weake, that they will not be able to helpe themſelues.
                     But theſe are friuolous reaſons, for the greateſt part of the bloud, which a woman voideth then, and all her month, is but ſuperfluous bloud, and is

good for nothing: which hath beene kept in the body a long time, euen the nine moneths, that ſhe hath gone with child: it beeing now neceſſary for her health to haue it voided out of her Matrice: that ſo her belly, which is ſwolne, and puft vp with the aboundance of bloud (like a ſponge that is full of water) may be quitted &amp; diſcharged, and returne to the naturall proportion and bigneſſe. And therefore for their healths ſake,She muſt ſee ſparingly. they muſt not feede ſo plentifully, the firſt daies, as the vulgar thinke: that by this abſtinence may hinder the Ague which may happen vnto them, and likewiſe keepe downe the aboundance of bloud, which would flow to their breaſts, and be conuerted into milke and by reaſon of the ſtore there of grow clotty and curdle, and in the end apoſtumate.
                     Wherefore the fiue firſt daies, let her vſe Broths,Her meats. panades, new egges, and gelly; not glutting her ſelfe (as commonly they doe) either with fleſh or Almonds: In the morning let her take a ſupping or broth: and ſo likewiſe at dinner, with a couple of new laid egges, and ſome panade, and again at ſupper, let her haue the like, cloſing her ſtomacke with a little gelly: but yet, if ſhe mean to nurſe her child herſelfe, ſhee muſt feede more plentifully. Let her drinke barley water, wherein a little Cinamon,A drinke. and a few coriander ſeeds haue been boyled. The great Ladies of Italy doe vſe a water, made of Capons which is this.
                     
                        Capon water for Ladyes.
                        Take two Capons ready pul'd, and dreſſed: boyle them in an earthen pot, with a ſufficient quantity of

faire water, till they bee halfe ſodden, then take them foorth, and cut them into ſmall peeces, to be vſed as followeth.
                     
                     
                        Take of Bugloſſe, Borage, and Balme, of each two good handfuls: whereof you muſt make a lay in a glaſſe, Limbicke, and vpon that, another of the ſaide Capons fleſh, and ſo vppon that a lay of leafe gold, with a dramme of the powder of pearle, then poure in ſome of the broth, on the top: which you ſhall do, vntill all be beſtowed in the ſame manner. This being done, you muſt diſtill it, in a double veſſel or Balneo Mariae, and draw a quart of water or thereabouts, which muſt be reitterated ſo often, till you thinke that you haue enough to ſerue the woman in child bed, for tenne or twelue daies: But this Curioſity, is for Princeſſes and great Ladies. The ſaide water muſt bee drawne ſixe weeks or two moneths before it bee vſed, and ſet in the ſunne in ſommer, and ouer an ouen in winter, to take away the rawneſſe that remaines in it.
                     If the woman haue not an ague, in my opinion, ſhe may drinke a little white or claret wine, with twice as much boyled water. But there bee ſome women that cannot endrue wine, and therefore let them drink water and hony boiled together, or elſe boiled water:Another drinke. if they deſire to drink in the day time between their meals, or elſe in the night, giue them a little ſyrop of Maiden haire, with boiled water, or any other ſyrop, ſo it be not aſtringent, becauſe of their purgings. When her paines; the feare of the ague, and the burning of her breaſts bee paſt, then

may ſhe feed more liberally, and then ſhe may eat at dinner a little meat, with her broth: as Capon, Pullet, Pigeon, or a bit of Veale: and at ſupper beſide her broth, a ſliſe of Veale, Mutton, Chicken or any other good meate.
                     The eight day beeing paſt, about which time commonly the wombe is well purged, and cleanſed, it will not bee amiſſe to nouriſh her better, giuing her more ſolide meat, and in greater quantity, that ſhe may grow ſtrong againe, the ſooner. All the which time ſhe muſt keepe her ſelfe very quiet, not much mouing, or ſtirring herſelfe, nor ſo much as once looking into the Aire. Let her ſpeake as little as may be, and haue no noiſe made about her,Noiſe is hurt

Let her ſleepe rather in the night,Sleepe. then in the day time: yet, if ſhe haue not reſted in the night by reaſon of ſome paines, then let her ſleepe, when ſoeuer it comes vpon her. And becauſe moſt women in that caſe, are Coſtiue, and cannot void their excrements: therefore it will bee very fit to giue her ſome ſuch gentle Gliſter.

                     I am of opinion that the Athenian women, while they were in Child-bed, did take the broth of Cabbage,The vſe of Coleworts. or Coleworts, rather to be looſe bellied, then to driue away witchcraft, as Athenaeus would haue it: For heretofore the Cabbage was Catoes Phiſick, and all his houſhold. And therefore when the Romanes baniſht the Phiſitions, Cato ſaide, that the Cabbage alone, was Phiſicke enough to cure all their diſeaſes; and beſides hee made a little Commentary vpon that ſubiect.

                        NOW I haue ſet downe the manner of dyet, a Woman in Child bedde ſhould obſerue, it will not be amiſſe to ſhew, what is fit to bee done vnto her, before ſhe ſit vp, or riſe, endeauouring heerein, to bring all the parts of her body, which haue beene ſtrayned, and as it were quite changed, through a long, and painefull trauaile, to their former ſtate, that they may be recouered, and grow ſtrong with as much ſpeed as may be poſſibly.
                     
                        If our French Ladyes, were (in this point) like vnto thoſe, which Veſputius Florentinus doth write of:Women t
                              •
                            are Virgins after child bearing. it would then be needles to preſcribe ſo many medicines, for the reſtoring them to the ſame ſtate they were in before their beeing with child. There are women (ſaith he) that dwell beyond the Antartique Pole, whoſe bodies are entire and Virgin like, euen after often child-bearing, and in whom there is perceiued no difference from them that are Virgins, as they that haue opened them, hauing made diligent ſearch, doe teſtifie: But ſince there bee no ſuch women found in our quarters, (though I dare boldly ſay, there be ſome, not much different) therfore will it be very neceſſary to haue a care what is to be done, to their belly, breaſts, and nether parts. Wherefore, after the ſheepes skin, or hares skin, hath ſtaid on foure or fiue houres, let it bee taken away, and the womans belly and groine, annointed with the liniment following. And then applying the Cearcloth of a iuſt bigneſſe, which muſt be continued the firſt ſeuen daies, dreſſing it euery morning, and turning the ſaide Cearecloth, ſomtimes on the one ſide, and ſometimes on the other, the liniment is this,

                     Of the accidents which happen to women newly deliuered. And firſt of their after-throwes. CHAP. III.
                     
                     
                        WE haue hitherto treated of the ordering of a Woman in Child-bed, as alſo of the time when ſhe ſhall bee ready to walke abroade and bee churched. But becauſe there doe befall them, many accidents, in the time of their lying in, I thought good to write thereof briefe-lie, and to ſhew the meanes whereby they may be helped and cured.
                     And ſince that the chiefeſt, ſymptome that happens vnto them, and which comes ſooneſt, is the after-throws: therefore I am determined to ſpeake of them firſt.
                     As ſoone as a Woman is deliuered of her childe and after-birth, for the moſt part, ſhe is taken with paines of her belly, which oftentimes are ſo great and violent, that ſhe thinkes her very belly, would bee rent, and cut aſunder in diuers places, from whence the french word that ſignifieth theſe pains and torments,Tranchees. was deriued.
                     
                        The firſt cauſe.The cauſe of theſe gripings or paines, may bee threefold. Firſt, either becauſe the Matrice &amp; thoſe parts thereabouts haue bene ſore troubled through the deliuery, by ſtriuing to bee vnburthened and

freed of the child: or elſe,The ſecond becauſe the bloud that runs, and gathers it ſelfe to the Wombe, (being retained) growes thicke and ſlimy, that it cannot eaſily flow, and ſo makes a diſtention of the Matrice, it being not able to come away, but in great clots, and hard matter, like vnto a falſe Conception: and likewiſe when it is altogether retained and ſtopt, it cauſes a great extenſion of the wombe.
                     Againe, it is oftentimes ſo cleere, thin, and ſharpe, that it flowes aboue meaſure, and through the acrimonie and biting thereof, doth gripe and torment, as it paſſeth along:The third. The third cauſe may proceed from the outward aire, which is enter'd, and got into the wombe, at the comming foorth of the child and the after-birth.
                     
                        Hippocrates hath obſerued,Sentence of Hippocrates.
                         that women in this euacuation, are troubled with gripings &amp; paines of their firſt childmore then of any after: the reaſon is, becauſe their veines are not accuſtomed to disburthen themſelues in this fort. Experience neuertheleſſe teacheth vs the contrarie; for a woman commonly of her firſt child, hath verie few of theſe paines, and gripings, and the more children ſhe hath, the more ſhe is troubled with them. The reaſon whereof ſeemes to bee this: becauſe the bloud, which in youth, is ſweet and milde, in proceſſe of time gets a bitter, ſalt, and aduſt qualitie, which paſſing through the veines, procureth this paine: For we find by experience, that the fleſh of beaſts, or fowle, when they are old, grow's vnpleaſant, as being hard, and harſh to the taſt.
                     
                        But what euer the cauſe of theſe paines be, we muſt ſeeke to aſſwage them, and to free the woman from them, aſwell as we can. If then theſe paines be ſmall, and that the after-purgings come moderately, we may leaue the worke, wholy to nature: onely giuing the woman in child-bed the drinke we preſcribed before: of Oile of ſweet Almonds, or of Walnuts, which of late hath been found by experience, to be better, then the Oile of Almonds, ſo that the Nuts be ſound, and white, not rancide, and the oyle drawne without fire.
                     This Oyle is much commended, for the gripings which comes by the acrimonie and ſharpneſſe of the bloud: and in this caſe alſo, ſome eaſie fomentations of warme Milke, or fit vpon the belly and lower parts:Fomentation. Fomentations alſo with Mallowes, March Mallowes, Parietarie, Mugwort, Camomile, Melilot, and Linſeed, boiled in Milke, are verie profitable.
                     When theſe paines and pangs proceed of thicke ſlimy bloud, which cannot eaſily flow: or of windy matter, which being ſhut vp, cannot be diſcuſſed, if the paine continue, beſide thoſe aforeſaid, you may vſe theſe remedies following.

                        THere are ſome Women, which are deliuer'd with ſo much difficultie, and are ſo long in trauaile, that to free themues from this miſerie and anguiſh, they are conſtrained to ſtraine, and force themſelues in ſuch ſort, that the Fundament, or the end of the great gut commeth foorth: for a woman, in her deliuerie muſt ſtraine and force her ſelfe, euen as one doth at the ſtoole: It may happen alſo that the Matrice, may follow the child, and after-birth; which is the precipitation, or comming downe of the wombe: the ligaments being looſened, and ſometimes broken, either through much ſtriuing, or becauſe that the Midwife, or Chirurgion, in drawing foorth the child, or after-birth, draw the Matrice together with it: which may be done, and yet not they in fault.
                     When the Fundament commeth foorth, it is to be put vp after this manner: Firſt, the Chirurgion muſt put vp the gut with a fine linnen cloth warme, as gently as poſſiblie he can:The Cure of the Fundament fallen. But if he find any difficultie herein, becauſe of ſome humour, with is come to it, by abiding in the Aire, all the time of the trauaile: or by any fluxe of humours, which the paine hath cauſed: then muſt he bath and foment

it, with a little Milke, wherein Red Roſes, white Mullen, Camomile, and Meliot haue been boiled: and when he ſhall ſee that the ſwelling is gone, and it is come to it ſelfe, then by little and little, he ſhall put it vp, not vſing any force, or violence at all.Foment. He may alſo (if the paine be aſſwaged) foment it with red Wine, in which Plantaine, white Mullen, Red Roſes, and Balauſts, haue been boiled, and then preſently, he ſhall gently put it vp. The Matrice alſo being fallen downe, ſhall be put vp after the ſame manner: but we will ſpeake more at large, of this and of the cauſes thereof, in an other place.

                     Somtimes it happens that the whole Perinaeum is diuided and rifted, euen vnto the fundament and that both the paſſages are brought into one: which accident I haue ſeene and for want of help, the ſides of the wound being hardned with a ſcarre, both the paſſages haue continued as one. For remedy wherof, I being once called, and finding the Woman to bee with child, I gaue her counſell to ſtay till ſhee were brought a bed: and about ſixe weekes after, ſhe was deliuered, being ſent for to cure her, I proceeded in this manner.

way the ſcarre, and skinne which was growne on both ſides, as the common practiſe is, for an hare lip which I haue ſhowne in my workes of Chirurgery: which worke I began from the naturall parts, and ſo went on to the fundament, not taking away much fleſh, but onely the skinne: which beeing taken off, and as it were flead away, I ſuffered the part to bleed well: both to ſhun an inflammation, and alſo to make the ſtitches with my needle, more conueniently. About the midſt of the clift, or diuiſion, I paſſed my needle through both ſides, thereof (hauing firſt laid them euen, as well aboue and below, as in the middle) and I tooke good hold of the fleſh on both ſides, there leauing my needle, about which I did turne and wind the thred on both ſides, as vſeth to be done in the cure of the hare lip: then at both ends of the clift I gaue a ſtitch, ſomewhat cloſe, ſuch as is commonly made in ſimple wounds, and vpon it I laid a little clout dipt in a balm, which I haue heere deſcribed, and vppon that a plaſter of Diacalcitheos.

                        WHen the Orifices of the veynes neare the fundament doe ſwell, and riſe, eyther more &amp; leſſe, according to the quantity of the humors, which doe fill them, the Greekes call this diſeaſe, the Hemorrhoides. Of theſe there are two ſorts, the one inward and hidden with in the fundament: the other outward, and apparant The cauſe heere of is ſtore of humors, which commonly are groſſe, and melancholicke, ſometimes flegmaticke or Cholericke, which filling the ſaide veines, afterward flow downe to the ends of them: which humors not finding way to iſſue out, doe extend the veines, in ſuch ſort, that ſometimes they become as big as Pigeons, nay ſometimes Pullets egges.

ſtraining to bring the child into the world, which maketh the bloud come into the ſaid veines, and dilateth them; the other, retention of their naturall courſes which being ſtayed, the bloud and humors which ſhould haue come foroth, chaunge their courſe, and being deriued into the veins of the fundament, procure the Hemorrhoides.
                     
                        The differences of Hemorrhodes.The Hemorrhoides doe differ, according to the nature of the humor, of which they are bred, for if they proceed of a flegmaticke, and watriſh bloud, becauſe of their colour, and the likeneſſe that they haue to a bladder full of water, they are called Veſicales, or vuales:
                        
                           Veſicales or vuales.
                         and theſe are white, ſoft, and not painefull, if they breede of a groſſe &amp; thicke flegme then they are called Verrucales,
                        
                           Verrucales.
                         and ficales: and theſe are hard, and painfull, eſpecially if there be any hot humor mixed with the matter of them, which may be known by their rednes. If they proceed of bloud and choller, together with ſome part of Melancholy, being vneuen, and rough, like a mulbery, then they be called Morales, theſe are very ſenſible, and painefull,
                           Morales.
                         and in colour neere to a deepe darke red.
                     Women are ſubiect to all theſe kinds of Hemorrhoides, but eſpecially after they be deliuered: But my purpoſe is not to write ſo generally of all theſe kinds, but onely of thoſe which are ſwolne, big, and painfull, which chiefely happen to women in child-bed, and bleed very little or not at all.
                     The cure conſiſts in three things, that is in dyet, in diuerting of the humor, which flowes to the part, &amp; in euacuating that humor which is contained in

it: which beeing done, the paine will bee eaſily appeaſed.
                     For the dyet,Dyet. it ſhall be ſuch as we haue already preſcribed for women in child-bed: the humor ſhal be diuerted by letting of bloud, firſt in the arme, &amp; then in the foote, in the veine Saphena, and laſtly by applying of Cupping glaſſes, to the ſide of the thighs, and that for two purpoſes: the one to bring downe the purgings, which beeing ſtayd may bee thought to be ſome cauſe of the Hemorrhoides, the other to diminiſh the quantity of bloud, in the crurall veine, which beeing emptied, will draw to it ſome part of that bloud, which flows to, (and it may be, ſome of that which is contained in) the Hemorrhoide veynes. As for the third point, which is to euacuate that bloud, which is now ſetled in the hemorrhoide veynes, that may bee done, by medicines which haue power to reſolue and digeſt and alſo to aſſwage paine of which kind is this following, which I haue vſed with good ſucceſſe, and Vigo before me.

                        IT happens to Women newly deliuered, that their after purgins ſomtimes come downe too immoderately, other times, that they are ſuddenly ſtaide. Theſe two accidents are very troubleſome,

                        Hippocrates writes, that both theſe bring many ſymptoms with them, whiche Galen alſo witneſſeth ſaying, If the purgings flow in too great aboundance, and aboue cuſtome, it brings women

into diuers diſeaſes, as Cold, Diſtemper, Dropſy, and Convulſions: and if the ſame be ſtayed, and do not flow at all, then ſome inconuenience happens to the Matrice, as inflammation, Eryſipelas, ſcyrrhus and at laſt Cankers. So that we may eaſily ſee how fit and neceſſary it is, that theſe purgings or courſes ſhould come away moderately, and in an indifferent quantity. This the Chirurgion ſhould know by obſeruing the time, and the quantity, which is limited for them, ſet downe in diuers places by the ancient writers: And firſt,How long t

                         for the continuance of time, that theſe purgings ſhould flow; Hippocrates, doth proportion the time, in which a woman in child-bed ſhould be purged, according to the time wherein the child is ſhaped or formed: which is 30. daies for a man-child, and 42. at moſt for a woman child.
                     This time may bee alſo meaſured according to that ordinary time of purging, that is omitted in the nine moneths, ſhe goes with child, as the bloud ſhould bee purged in euery one of theſe nine moneths, as in euery one of them, the ſpace of three or foure daies (which put together amount to twenty ſeuen or thirty ſixe dayes) ſo in recompenſe heerof, when a woman is deliuered, ſhe muſt bee purged, 27. or 36. daies.
                     It is written in Leuiticus,
                        
                           Leuit. chap. 12
                         that when a woman hath brought foorth a man child, ſhee ſhall continue in the bloud of her purifying three and thirty dayes, but if ſhe beare a maid child, then ſhee ſhall continue in the bloud of her purifying 66. dayes.
                     
                        
                        
                           Lib. de morbis Malier.
                        As for the quantity and proportion of theſe purgings Hippocrates is of opinion, that the purgings which a woman ſhould haue euery moneth, ſhould bee a pint and a halfe, or thereabouts. And in his booke de natura Pueri, hee would haue a woman in childbed at the beginning ſhould purge about thirteene or fourteen ounces, or a pint, and ſo the whole ſpace of thirty daies for a man child, and forty two daies for a maiden-childe, euery day diminiſhing the quantity till it wholly leaue her.
                     
                        Signes to know whether a woman in child-bed be in health or no.As for the quality of theſe purgings, if the bloud be red, as in a beaſt new killed, and doe preſently congeale, and thicken, then it is a ſigne that ſhee is in good health, and will continue ſo all the time of her lying in. But when theſe purgings come in little quantity, and of an ill colour, and do not congeale ſuddenly, it is a ſigne that the woman is not well, nor will not finde her ſelfe ſo all her month as the foreſaid Author well obſerueth.
                     But it is not to bee expected that all women ſhould haue their purgings in like quantity, for wee muſt reſpect the habitude of the body, the courſe of life, the temperament, &amp; other particular things which in diuers women,
                           Comment. in. 6. Epidemior.
                         are diuers. Therefore Galen ſaith, that theſe purgings continue long in women that haue thinne and ſubtill bloud;
                           De mor. Mulier.
                         
                        Hippocrates ſaith that women that are of full bodies, are purged more exactly, and againe hee writes, that women, that are more in yeares commonly haue more of this euacuation then they that are younger.
                     There may be two cauſes aſſigned of this abundant

euacuation, the one, outward, as ſome fall, blow, or painefull trauaile, which a woman may ſuffer, either in bringing foorth her childe, or the after-birth: It may alſo ariſe from paſions of the mind, or from the vnſeaſonable vſe of bath's, or from ſome other ill gouernement in her child-bed.
                     The inward cauſes may bee two:Inward cauſes. either the ſtrength and vigor of the mother, which expelleth and putteth foorth ſo much bloud, as is troubleſome, and burdenſome vnto her; and in this kind there is no great danger, becauſe ſhe that is ſo ſtrong, to expell in this ſort, will be alſo able to retaine, ſo much as will be conuenient and neceſſarie for her. Or elſe contrariwiſe, this may proceed from the weakneſſe, and faintneſſe of the woman, who is not able to retaine, and keep, that bloud which nature hath prouided for her: and this hapneth chiefly when the orifices of the veines continue open, after the deliuerie, not being able,

                         (as Hippocrates ſaith) to ſhut, and gather themſelues together.
                     The other cauſe is referred to the bloud, which offends either in quantitie, or qualitie, or both: In reſpect of the quantitie, thoſe women haue ſtore of theſe after-purgings, which are full of bloud; becauſe the Liuer breeds more bloud, then is neceſſarie: which afterward is voided by the Matrice.
                     The qualitie of the bloud, is cauſe heerof, when it is too ſharpe, piercing, thin, watrie, putride, or venimous, ſo that Nature deſires to be rid of it.
                     
                        
                        The Cure.As for the Cure, you muſt fit that according to the cauſe, and yet there be ſome generall remedies, which may ſerue for all immoderate euacuations; and of this kind,Dyet. is Diet, which muſt be cooling, and moderately drying. Let her feed vpon good meats not ſalt, nor ſpiced, nor of ſtrong taſt; rather roaſt, then boiled: and of boiled meats, let her chuſe, to eat of the heads, &amp; feet. She may vſe french Barley, new laid Egges, and Gellies made with aſtringent herbes. If ſhe take any Broth's, let them be prepared with Borage, Bugloſſe, Le tuce, Purcelaine, Barley, and the cold ſeeds: Let her ſhun anger, melancholie, griefe, and other ſuch paſsions of the mind: Let her keep her ſelfe quiet, not much ſtirring, or troubling her bodie. Let her drinke Barley water, or water wherein Steel hath been quenched. You may giue her alſo (if ſhe haue not an Ague) a little Wine, allaied with the ſaid waters.
                     
                        Diuers remedies.Let her make her abode in a temperate place, not too hote; Let her lie vpon a Mattreſſe, or ſtraw bed, and not vpon a feather-bed.
                     It will be good to bind her armes hard toward the ſhoulders, but not the thigh's, although Auicen preſcribe it. Cupping glaſſes applied vnder the paps, and vpon the region of the Liuer, will be verie ſit, as Hippocrates teacheth: and likewiſe vpon the arme-pits, and ſhoulders, as Auicen counſaileth. The moſt ſingular,An experiment ſeen by the Authour. and preſenteſt remedie is to let bloud in the arme, which I haue ſeen tried by the moſt learned Phyſitions of our age, with very good ſucceſſe: For there is no meanes, that makes better

revulſion, and drawes the bloud ſooner from the place, to which it floweth, then opening of a veine. You ſhall applie vpon the raines, the Os ſacrum, and the parts thereabouts, a cloth dip'd in Vineger, and water, and likewiſe betweene the legs; but firſt vſe this Cataplaſme.

                        AS a Woman newly deliuer'd is ſubiect to many accidents, by the ouermuch flowing of her naturall courſes: So is ſhe likewiſe ſubiect to more dangerous and deadly chances,

                            are. if they be ſuppreſſed and ſtaid. Galen ſaith, that theſe after-purgings, (which he calleth Lechia) are purgings of ill humors, which haue been gathered in the bodie all the time, that the woman went with child: For the child drawing to it ſelfe, the ſweeteſt

and moſt familiar part of the bloud, leaues the worſt, which otherwiſe, if the woman were not with child, ſhould be voided out euery Moneth. And if the monthly ſickneſſe ſtai'd, doth bring manie inconueniences to a woman, then much more theſe Lochia being ſuppreſſed, muſt breed much more danger.
                     
                        A ſentence of Hippocrat.
                        
                        Hippocrates in his firſt booke De morbis Mulier: witneſſeth this plainly, ſaying; That when the After-purgings come in leſſe quantitie, then is fit, then the woman in child-bed fals into a ſharpe Ague, ſhe is troubled with a paine in her ſtomacke, ſhe finds her ſelfe ill, through all her bodie; ſhe feeles a paine in the ioints of her hands, in her thigh's, and hips, the places about her necke, backe, and groine are ſore; and there is a weakneſſe in euery part: She fals into a vomiting of fleame, and alſo of bitter and ſharpe matter: and finally, ſhe is in danger to be lame and impotent of ſome of her members:The ſtopping of the After-purging cauſe death. For the Matrice hath an affinitie and connexion, with many parts of the bodie; as with the head, and ſtomacke. And if this matter be tranſported and carried to the head, breaſt, and lungs, and there make an abode, then the woman dyes preſently; but if it be voided by the mouth, or noſe, then ſhe may eſcape.
                     
                        Outward cauſes.The cauſes of this ſuppreſſion are of two kinds, either inward, or outward: The outward cauſes are ſadnes, griefe, ſuddain apprehenſion of ſome ill newes, feare, frighting, and ſuch like paſsions of the mind: Likewiſe, cold which the woman hath taken,

which ſhutteth vp the veines of the Matrice; a bad dyet, and amongſt other things,

                               Mulier. Inward cauſes. the ſame Author writes that the vlcers which happen by reaſen of a long and troubleſome deliuery, doe cauſe an inflammation, and ſwelling, which makes the ſide of the wombe come together, and ſhuts vp the orifices of the veines thereof: from whence proceedes ſuppreſſion of the after-Purgins. Likewiſe the ouer great quantity of thicke and groſſe bloud, may bee the cauſe, as alſo the weakeneſſe of the Matrice, the which becauſe it hath beene ſore wearied and troubled in the deliuery, and thereby loſt all ſtrength is not able to disburden and free it ſelfe, of the bloud whereof it is full.
                     
                        Hippocrates alſo in the ſame place giues another cauſe, which is,
                           Hippoc. loco citato.
                         when the mouth of the ſaid womb is ſhrunke, or turned awry, or elſe, becauſe the ſides of it are ſunke downe, ſhut together and inflammed.
                     For the Cure heereof, ſhee muſt obſerue an order of dyet, which ſhall be moiſtning, and opening.Dyet. Her meate and drinke muſt be ſuch, as we haue formerly preſcribed, for one newly deliuered. Shee ſhall take operitiue Broths, thereby to open the orifices of the veines, which are much ſtopt: and according to the cauſe, ſo the remedies muſt be fitted as if it come by any ſudden apprehenſion, griefe, or anger, then muſt ſhe be plaſant, and make her ſelfe,

ſhe was deliuered, and by this meanes ſhe was well diſcharged of them, although before, ſhe had bene in great, and generall Convulſions.

Her belly alſo muſt be kept looſe by Cliſters, and if ſhe can vomit eaſily, ſhe muſt be helped that way alſo.

                     Of the falſe Conception ſtayed, and abiding in the woman after her deliuery. CHAP. IX.
                     
                     IT may happen to ſome women, that after they haue been well deliuered of their children, there may ſtay with them one or more falſe conception. Some of theſe falſe conceptions ſticke faſt to

the wombe, ſome are vnfaſtned, and looſe.Difference o

                            falſe conception. If they be ſmall, they come foorth together with the purgings; but if they be big, they oftentimes ſtay, and abide within. And in this caſe the Chirurgion muſt be carefull, for if they bee bigge, and cleaue to the wombe, they may bring much inconuenience to the woman, by their long ſtaying behind. So then it will be neceſſary for him to know, whether there be any of this kind, and of what nature it is, which he ſhal learne of the Mother, by demanding of her, how ſhe found her ſelfe all the time ſhee went with child. Firſt then let him enquire of her, whether ſhe were very big, at that time, and if ſhe had any hardneſſe, in any part of her belly, whether ſhee hath beene vſed to any ſuch accident, with her other children: for there are women, which at euery birth haue of theſe falſe conceptions, and amongſt others Miſtris Brague-longue,
                        A ſtory. hath ſhewed the proofe hereof: For ſhe going with her ſecond child, could aſſure me, that then ſhe had a falſe conception, becauſe ſhe had one with her firſt child: which ſhee came to know by reaſon of a certaine hardneſſe, which ſhe had vpon her left ſide, neere to her ſhort ribs, where ſhe felt a great paine, yea, and her ribs ſeemed to be borne vp, or thruſt outward: And indeed, this Gentlewoman, after ſhe was deliuered, brought foorth one bigger then ones fiſt, and before ſhe could be rid of it, her belly was ſwoln with paine and murmurings about her Nauell, and toward her loins: ſhe was often troubled with throws:Signes. as if ſhe ſhould be deliuered againe, by reaſon the

nature did ſtriue, to put and ſend that forth, which was vnnaturall.
                     Beſide theſe ſimptomes, women that haue falſe conceptions ſomwhat bigger, and cleauing faſt to the wombe, are troubled with great paine about the nauell, with vnquietnes, watring of the mouth, vomiting, and heauineſſe downeward. The pulſe is ſmall, and frequent, and ſome women in this caſe haue the ſtrangury, becauſe the falſe conception doth preſſe the necke of the bladder: and to conclude almoſt the ſame accidents are here, that happen, when there is a mole or dead child.
                     
                        The prognoſticke.Thoſe falſe conceptions that are ſmall, though two, three, foure, or more in number (as there may be many) they come forth eaſily, &amp; are conuaied away with the ordinary purgings, but if they be great and hard, they are voided with much difficulty, eſpecially if they ſtick to the womb, and then there is daunger that they will turne into a mole: which muſt ſpeedily be preuented:
                           Hip. lib. de ſterilibus.
                         although Hippocrates wiſheth that this ſhould be done with prediction. Now this may be preuented (as he ſaith) by theſe three meanes; firſt by the vſe of reſoluing bath's, which haue power to moiſten the whole body,Cure. and ſo to dilate and inlarge the paſſage of the Matrice, that it may come foorth: the ſecond is by Cliſters and purgations, which may purge foorth excrements, and alſo bring downe the naturall courſes afreſh. Thirdly, by iniections, which may prouoke and ſtirre vp the expulſiue faculty of the Matrice, to expell the purgings and with them the falſe conconception

contained in the wombe. But becauſe all theſe remedies haue beene handled in the laſt chapter I refer the Chirurgion thither.
                  
                  
                     Of the falling downe or precipitation of the Matrice. CHAP. X.
                     
                     
                        THe ancient writers haue obſerued, that the matrice moueth and changeth his place, diuerſly: and as Hippocrates ſaith,
                           De Morbis mul. lib. 2. the Matrice cauſeth great paines in diuers places, according as it ſetleth, and placeth it ſelfe.
                     If it riſe toward the head,
                           Hippocrat. lib. 2. de morb. mulier. de natura mulieb. et. 2. Epidem.
                         then the veines which are in the noſe, and vnder the eies, ſuffer paine, the head is heauy, and ſometime the woman fometh at the mouth. If the ſaid Matrice moueth toward the liuer, preſently the woman is depriued of her ſpeech, her teeth are ſet, and her colour grows wan and pale. If it incline toward the ribs, then the woman falls into a cough with pain of her ſide: and the matrice hard and painfull to be touched, as if there were ſome vlcer, &amp; ſhee is troubled alſo with ſhortnes of breath, and ſometimes, with Convulſions: and if ſhe continue thus long, ſhe will grow lame: Againe if the Matrice turne to one ſide, there will be a paine felt, right againſt the place, to which it inclines, together with a paine in the backe: and at laſt ſhee becomes lame of that ſide as Hippocrates,
                        
and Aetius do witneſſe: when it beareth down towards the groine,
                           Hippocrat. Epidem 2 and paſſage of the Vrine, then the pain is more violent, together with a dulneſſe, &amp; numneſſe of the thigh: and ſuppreſſion of vrine: as likewiſe if it be caſt backe, toward the great gut, then the excrements of the belly are ſtopped; If it fall downe lower, euen to the thighs, then there wil be a Convulſion or crampe, of the great toe; and the hips and thighs, will be pained. And therefore not vnfitly did Plato compare the matrice to a liuing creature,
                           Plato.
                         which was as it were ingrafted, vpon an other liuing creature. For the Matrice hath voluntary motion, toward euery part, and certainly Scimus vterum naturaliter, vt ſemen excipiat, hiare, et ipſo ſuſcepto conſtringi.
                     
                     
                        How the matrice moueth.But theſe ſituations, and changings of place muſt not be vnderſtood, in an exact ſence. For it is vnlikely, nay impoſſible, that the Matrice, ſhould ſo run from one ſide of the body to another, that it ſhould altogether leaue his owne place. And this hath Galen very well noted,
                           Gal. in lib. 3. de Articul. com.
                         ſaying, that ſometimes the matrice aſcendeth vpward, and ſometimes it is turned aſide: not that of it ſelfe it leaues his naturall place but becauſe it is drawne by ſome thing elſe: that is, by the ligaments which hold it vp,How the matrice chaungeth place. and by the nerues, arteries, and veines to which it is annexed. To this authority of Galen I will adde farther, that the Matrice may be ſhut vp, and gathered into it ſelfe, and ſo draw with it thoſe parts, to which it is faſtned, offending &amp; affecting them, by ſome ſpirits, vapors, or wind, which it may communicate vnto thē.
                     
                        But I will leaue this curious ſpeculation to Phyſitions, and will onely meddle with that, which belongs to Chirurgions, concerning the precipitation, or falling downe of the Matrice, of which there are three kinds.
                     The firſt,The firſt falling of the matrice. when the necke thereof (which is called Vagina) ſincketh and falleth downe, euen to the entrance of the naturall parts, and drawes, a little with it, the bodie of the Matrice:
                           Hipp. Lib. de natura Pueri.
                         And this we may eaſily learne of Hippocrates, who ſaith, that the Matrice commeth downe in ſuch ſort, that you may applie a liniment thereunto: And againe, that it commeth nearer to the entrance, than is needfull.
                           Hipp. Lib. de natura Muliebri. The ſecond kind.
                     
                     The ſecond kind is, when the bodie of the Matrice falleth into the outward necke, called Vagina, and is thruſt a little out of the entrance, of the naturall parts, and then the inward necke, which is ſunke downe, ſhewes it ſelfe to the light, in the forme of the top of a mans yard:
                           Hipp. Lib. de Sterilibus de morb. Mulier.
                         Which Hippocrates alſo affirmes, when he ſaith, that the wombe commeth by little and little, out of the naturall parts.
                     The third kind is,The third kind. when the bodie and necke of the Matrice is all ſunke downe, and turned the wrong ſide outward: as one ſhould turne the crowne of his hat: and then it commeth cleane out of the naturall parts, and hangs betweene the thigh's, in the bigneſſe of a mans fiſt, or more, not vnlike to the cod or purſes of a mans priuie parts,

                               partium
                         as Galen writes.
                     The generall cauſe hereof is, becauſe the ligaments,

which ſhould hold and faſten it, are reſolued and broken, which may proceed either of an inward, or an outward cauſe.
                     
                        Outward cauſes.The outward cauſe may be, ſome fall, or blow, or for that the woman hath lifted ſome heauy burthen; or hath been in ſome rage, or choller; or had a violent Cough: running alſo, dauncing, leaping, riding in a Coach; taking cold of her feete, ſitting vpon a cold ſtone, and ouermuch cooling of the Matrice, may be cauſes thereof.
                     
                        Inward cauſes.The inward cauſes are, abundance of moiſture, which hath relaxed the ligaments: or elſe a longing deſire which a woman may haue, for the companie of a man; which may alſo happen to maides, and barren women;
                           Hippocrat. Epidem 2. as Hippocrates writeth: Another cauſe may be, the long ſuppreſſion of the naturall courſes, which ſometimes makes a woman grow Viril,
                           Hippocrat. Epidem 6. or mankind, as Hippocrates witneſſes of Phaëtuſa, wife of Pitheus, who became like a man, with a beard, and a mans voice.
                     
                        
                           Hipp. de Natura Mulier. 2.The ſaid Hippocrates giueth another reaſon, contrarie to the former, which is becauſe ſhe hath had the companie of her husband too ſoone after her deliuerie, while her ſickneſſe is yet vpon her.
                     But commonly this falling downe of the Matrice doth come (as Hippocrates noteth) by being ill deliuered:
                           Hippocrat. de Eiectione Foe

                         To which alſo Galen ſubſcribeth, making a ſimilitude of it, to two that wraſtle together, one of which falling to the ground,
                           Gal. de facult. Natur. lib. 3. drawes his fellow with him, and makes him fall alſo; euen ſo, the Matrice ſtriuing to put foorth the child, doth thruſt

foorth it ſelfe alſo; eſpecially if the ligaments,A Compariſon. which ſhould hold it to the backe, bee naturally looſe, and weake. It may alſo happen, that while the Midwife drawes foorth the child, or the after-birth, the Matrice may follow it together.
                     In this caſe, although Hippocrates in his booke before cited, ſeem to be of opinion,Both old and young may be cured hereof. that there is no remedie, but for young women, leauing elder women without helpe. Yet I haue cured them, euen of all ages, with verie good ſucceſſe.
                     For the Cure therefore,The Cure. we haue three intentions: The firſt, to bring the Matrice into his owne place: the ſecond, to keep it there: the third, to ſtrengthen it, being there keept. For the firſt, let the Chirurgion place the woman in this ſort: Let her lye vpon her backe, with her legs higher then her head, and her feet drawne vp in ſuch ſort, that her heeles may almoſt touch her hinder parts, with her thigh's and knees ſpread abroad.
                     If the Matrice be fallen downe,The way to put it vp. but a little it may eaſily be put vp, nay, it will euen go vp of it ſelfe: But if it be much fallen downe before it be put vp, it muſt be ſuppled and ſoftned, that ſo it may returne more eaſie, and with leſſe paine: Let it be annointed therefore, with the cooling ointment of Galen, or elſe with ſome ſuch liniment as this.

                     After that you haue vſed this fomentation, put vp the Matrice gently, with a ſoft linnen cloth, and when it is put vp, let the woman draw vp her breth as we vſe to bid them, that haue a Hernia, or burſting, to be put vp, and by this meanes the Matrice will be brought to his place, the more eaſily. Beſide you muſt remember, that if there bee any tenſion, hardnes or inflammation in the Matrice, to ſoften and ſouple it, with the aforeſaid liniment, and fomentation, and ſo will the inflammation be aſſwaged.A good obſeruation. And if you find that the bladder or great gut bee full of excrements (as I haue ſeene, not long ſince in a poore Woman of Maſſon, by meanes whereof the Matrice was ſhut, and kept out) then firſt you muſt make way for the Vrine by a Catheter, and alſo voide out the excrements by Clitters.
                     
                        The ſecond meanes to help vp the matriceFor the ſecond intention, which is to keepe the Matrice in his place, when it is well put vp and placed, the beſt and ſureſt meanes is to thruſt vp a peſſary, ſuch a one as is here deſcribed, which hath this power to keepe the Matrice vp, and yet not put it to any paine.

                     Beſide, it will not hinder the Matrice from purging out ſuch euacuations, as a woman newly deliuer'd hath, or any other humour, which may be contained in the wombe: For this Peſſarie hath a hole in the midſt of it, to giue ſuch excrements free paſſage and iſſue.
                     
                        The Peſſarie being put vp, let it abide there two or three daies, when you take it out, put vp a freſh one, keeping that to ſerue another time. There muſt alſo be a little ſtring tyed to it, ſo to be faſtned to a girdle, or ſome other thing, leaſt it fall downe to the ground: The figure heere ſet downe doth ſhew the manner of it.

                     When the time of purging is paſt, then muſt there a care be had of the whole habit, and conſtitution of the bodie.
                           Hipp. de natura Muliebri.
                         
                        Hippocrates wiſheth that ſhe eate little, and drinke leſſe, the firſt ſeuen daies; after which, ſhe may take ſome ſuſtenance; and when ſhe would disburthen nature, let her ſit vp in her bed, but not riſe from thence in fortie daies. After that time accompliſhed, ſhee may walke gently; but in no wiſe bath her ſelfe. If ſhe be full of bad humours, let her be purged, if ſhe hath not had her courſes, or purgings ſufficiently, and if ſhe be full of bloud, it will be conuenient to open a veine. And becauſe the ligaments, which tie, and hold the Matrice, are oftentimes much moiſtned, and relaxed with ſlime, and fleame, which fals vpon them; it will be neceſſarie to drie them, by euacuating, and drawing away the humour, which is the cauſe heereof.
                           Hipp. de morb. Mulier. lib. 2. To this purpoſe, Hippocrates doth much commend vomiting, becauſe it riddeth away ſuch flegmaticke humours,Vomiting is neceſſarie. as commonly are

in the ſtomacke, by turning them another way. Beſides that, the ſtomacke while it heaues it ſelfe vpward, lifts, and drawes vp the Matrice with it; but this muſt be done conſiderately, becauſe ſtrong and violent vomiting ſhakes and troubles the Diaphragme and guts, making them preſſe downward, and by this meanes keep downe the Matrice.

                        THere is another troubleſome accident, which chanceth to ſome Women after their deliuery.The cauſe. which is the vniting, and ſticking together of the necke of the wombe: and this happens through hard trauaile, which hath torne, and excoriated the ſides thereof: or elſe by reaſon of ſome inflammation, or vlcer, which hath there hapned, through ſome ſharp and biting humor, which hath corroded and exulcerated the ſaid part: which beeing neglected and ill cured, the ſides not being healed and ſcarred, it happens, that they are ioined, and grow together, and ſo be come one body.
                     
                        Galen hath made mention of this accident:
                           Gal. lib. de

                         and wee haue ſometimes ſeene the experience of it.
                     As for the cure heereof the woman muſt be purged, and let bloud,Cure. then bathed for diuers daies together: and the bath muſt bee made of emollient things: likewiſe there muſt be many remollient fomentations vſed, to her lower parts, and after them diuers liniments, ſuch as we haue preſcribed in diuers places: when the parts are ſufficiently ſoftned, then muſt you place the woman in the ſame manner, as is deſcribed, when ſhee is to bee deliuered:

then when you perceiue the ſmalnes and ſtraightneſſe of the paſſage,The practiſe. you ſhall apply a Dilatory inſtrument made in the forme of a ſpeculum Matricis, and by little and little you ſhall dilate &amp; ſtretch the parts ſo ioyned together, which will part and ſeuer one from another, without any effuſion of bloud: And this haue I practiſed with good ſucceſſe, of late daies vpon a tenant of Madame Sacon as I haue declared before, and this I did when ſhe was ready to lye downe, and yet no ill accident happened vpon it.
                     But if ſo be the calloſity ſhould be ſo hard (as by continuance of time it may be) that the ſaid parts ſhould grow together again, and could not be ſoftned, then will it bee neceſſary firſt to make an inciſion, that ſo it may bee dilated, more eaſily. And this hath Mons. Pineau and my ſelfe practiſed, vpon a Gentlewoman, as I haue more at large ſet down, in my book of the nurſing and gouernment of children, in the Chapter of thoſe that haue their naturall parts ſhut vp, and without paſſage.
                     
                        Muſt take heed of leting it grow together againe.The reſt of the cure muſt bee performed in that manner which I haue ſet downe in the place laſt cited: and heerein muſt a ſpeciall care be had, that the parts ioyne not, nor knit together again: to preuent the which, the woman ſhall weare a peſſary continually vntill ſuch time as the skarrebe perfectly growne, and confirmed: And to this purpoſe let the ſpeculum Matricis be often vſed, to inlarge the part: For it is certaine, that all ſuch Membranes as haue beene ioyned and grown together, when they

are diuided and ſeuered, doe hardly come to that length, and bigneſſe that they were of at the firſt. And this I haue often obſerued and amongſt other places in the mouth, wherof Monſ. Pigray and Monſ. Pincau the Kings Chirurgions in ordinary, &amp; ſworn at Paris, will bear me witneſſe, that I together with them cured an honeſt man, who had one ſide of his checke grown faſt to his iaw,A ſtory. which made him that hee could not open his mouth, nor ſpeake plaine. I cut and ſeparated the membrane, a good way, which did knit and tye theſe parts together, but while I went about to cicatriſe both ſides which I had deuided: had I not had the greater care to haue hindered it, the parts had grown together againe, that I was conſtrained to make a new ſeparation three diuers times.

                  THE PREFACE TO Ladies, wherein they are exhorted to nurſe their Children themſelues.
                  
                     AVLVS Gellius (in my opinion) did not amiſſe in putting no difference betweene a woman that refuſes to nurſe her owne childe; and one that kills her child, as ſoone as ſhee hath conceiued; that ſhee may not bee troubled with bearing it nine moneths in her wombe. For why may not a woman with as good reaſon, deny to nouriſh her child with her bloud, in her wombe, as to deny it her milke being borne? ſince the milk is nothing elſe but bloud whitened, beeing now brought to perfection and maturity.
                  But ſome will ſay that the child may bee deliuered to ſome other Woman, to nurſe it, and that the Mother may haue an eye and care ouer it: But (Gentle Ladies) here I deſire you to conſider with me the great inconueniences that may hence ariſe, which though they bee infinite, yet I will reduce them to foure heads.
                  
                     
                        1. First there is danger leaſt the child be changed and an other put in his place.
                        2. Then that naturall affection which ſhould be betwixt

the mother and the child by this meanes is diminiſhed.
                        
                           3. Thirdly, it may be feared, that ſome bad conditions or inclinations may be deriued from the Nurſe into the child.
                        
                           4. And lastly, the Nurſe may communicate ſome imperfection of her body into the child.
                     
                  
                  
                     1. As for the firſt point, which is the changing of the child, that may eaſily come to paſſe; becauſe as ſoone as the child is borne, and Chriſtned, the Mother preſently deliuers it to the Nurſe, to bee carried into the Country: Where the child, being wholly left to the diſcretion of the Nurſe, may by ſome ill chance be ſtifled, ouer-laid, be let fall, and ſo come to an vntimely death: or elſe may be deuoured, ſpoiled, or diſfigured by ſome wild beaſt, Wolfe, or Dogge, and then the Nurſe fearing to be puniſhed for her negligence, may take another child into the place of it, which can hardly euer be marked and diſtinguiſhed: And indeede when children grow ſomwhat big, and are brought home from Nurſe, if they proue not like their parents in body, in conditions and wit, the Prouerbe goes, That they are chaunged at Nurſe; Which ſometimes may bee truer, then they are aware of.
                  The Hiſtoriographers report that Arthebar King of the Epirotes being old, had one only ſonne, whoſe nurſe was corrupted with great gifts to change him, and to take a Gentlemans ſonne into his place. But when the King was dead, the Nurſe repenting her ſelfe of this wickedneſſe, reuealed the error: wherupon enſued ſuch terrible wars, betweene the lawfull and the ſuppoſed ſon, that both of them loſt their liues, in a battaile. Vpon

this occaſion, Thomiſtus the ſeuenth King of the Lacedemonians leauing two ſonnes behind him, when he dyed; the Lacedemonians choſe the younger of them for their King, becauſe he had beene nurſed by the Queene his Mother; and reiected the eldeſt, who had beene brought vp by a ſtrange woman; fearing leaſt he had bene changed by his Nurſe.
                  
                     2. For the ſecond point which is naturall affection, without doubt that cannot bee ſo earneſt, either from the Mother toward the child, or from the chlld toward the Mother; if ſhee haue not nurſed him and giuen him ſucke. For if ſhe nurſe him, he ſucks and draws her owne bloud. Whereupon grows a familiar inwardnes, and the child (when he comes to yeares of diſcretion) finds himſelfe bound to his Mother, for many benefits: both in that ſhe hath borne him nine Moneths in her womb, and alſo becauſe ſhee hath nurſed him, watched him, and often made him cleane. In recompence whereof, he endeuours to ſhew her a thouſand delights, to make her forget or take in good part, ſo much care and paines, as ſhee hath taken with him. Hee playes a number of apiſh trickes about her, he kiſſeth her, ſtrokes her haire, noſe, and eares: he flatters her, he counterfeits anger, and other paſsions, and as he groweth bigger, hee finds other ſports with her, which cauſeth that they beare one another ſuch an affection, as cannot be expreſſed; &amp; makes that they can neuer be parted: When hee is bigge, and comes to be weaned, if one chide his nurſe he cries, and ſtamps: and if one offers to take him out of his nurſes armes, he will flye in their faces, and if it were poſsible, he would euen pull out their heart: and all this proceeds from that inward affection of the child, to which no

loue can bee compared. And heereupon Plato iuſtly ſaid, That children would neuer loue their parents ſo well; but that their fathers doe often beare them in their armes, and the mothers giue them ſucke at their owne breaſts.
                  
                  And heereof wee haue a memorable example in Cornelius Scipio, who when he had condemned ten of his moſt valiant Captaines to death, he would not heare his owne Brother Scipio Africanus intreating for them, and yet granted their pardon, to one that had bin his Foſter-brother, and ſucked the ſame Nurſe: which being obiected to him, by his owne Brother, ſaying; That they had been borne both of one Mother; He anſwer'd him, That his Nurſe-Mother had deſerued better of him, than his owne Mother had done. One of the familie of the Gracchi, returning from the warre, met his owne Mother, and his Nurſe together: but he addreſsing himſelfe, firſt to his Nurſe, preſented to her a Girdle of gold, and then to his Mother, a Iewell of of ſiluer: which ſhe taking indig
                        •
                     ely, and rebuking him with reproaches, he replyed: I know (Mother) that you bore me nine Moneths in your wombe, yet that was out of neceſsitie, becauſe you could do no otherwiſe; but when I was borne, then you forſoke me, and my Nurſe-mother willingly intertain'd me, carried me three yeares in her armes, and nouriſh'd me with her owne bloud.
                  
                     3. As for the maners and conditions of the child, there is no doubt to be made, but that they are better bred and faſhioned by the Mother, than by the Nurſe. For first, it is deliuered by learned writers, that the Manners and conditions of the mind, do follow the

temperament of the bodie, and the temperament ariſeth out of the nouriſhment: ſo that commonly, ſuch as the humours are, ſuch proue the manners. Hence muſt we conclude, that the child that ſuckes a Nurſe, that is vitious, and wicked; ſucketh alſo from her, her faults and vices: And beſide, when the child comes to vnderſtanding, and obſerues what the Nurſe ſpeakes and doth, he retaines that, ſaies it after her, and imitates her: and that which is imprinted from the infancie, will hardly, or neuer be rooted out. For this cauſe Plato warnes vs, not to ſpeake, or ſhew any thing before a child, which is not decent, and honeſt: and Ariſtotle forbids, to let a child ſee any wanton or laſciuious picture. Then (to returne to our Nurſe) we may be aſsured, that the Milke (wherewith the child is nouriſh'd two yeares together) hath as much power to make the children like the Nurſes, both in bodie, and mind; as the ſeed of the Parents hath to make the children like them. For although the child be borne of honeſt Parents, neuertheleſſe, the bad nurture of a wicked Nurſe, will make the child vicious and wicked: For, (as the prouerbe is) Nurture preuailes more than Nature. This may be plainly obſerued in all things, that haue life: for a faire and flouriſhing tree, which hath been bred in a good and fat ground, if it be tranſplanted into a barren ground, becomes a ſhrub, and beares no fruit, that is good, and taſtfull. Likewiſe, the graine that is ſowed in good ground, will beare a faire and odoriferous flower; but if it be caſt into bad ground, it will bring foorth a baſtard flower, without any good or pleaſing ſmell. It is reported, that a certaine child, was nouriſh'd with the milke of

a Bitch: But he would riſe in the night and houle with other dogges. Plato going about to giue a reaſon, why Alcibiades was ſo hardy, although he were an Athenian (who naturally were milde and timerous) reſolues it thus: becauſe the ſaid Alcibiades had been nurſed by a Lacedaemonian woman, which is a verie ſtout, and valiant Nation.
                  
                     4. As for the imperfections of the bodie, which children may borrow from their Nurſes, although they bee very many, yet conſider only thoſe, which the corpulencie, and diſeaſes of the Nurſe may bring them. Tacitus writeth, that the Germanes of all other people, are the biggeſt, and ſtrongeſt of bodie; and the reaſon is, becauſe they are nurs'd by their Mothers, which are big of ſtature. And it is obſeru'd, that they which put foorth their children, to women of ſmall ſtature, haue them, neither ſo big, nor ſtrong and able of bodie, as if they had brought them vp themſelues. If a young Lambe ſucke a Goate, it is found by experience, that the wooll of it will be harder, then of other ſheepe, and he will prooue more fierce, and wild, then is naturall for his kind.
                  And to this purpoſe, Procopius relates a ſtorie of Polopeia, the daughter of Theſeus, who being deliuer'd in ſecret of a ſonne, and deſirous to conceal her immodeſtie, caus'd him to be caſt into a forrest, where he being found by a Sheep-heard, was brought vp and nouriſh'd with Goates milke, (from whence he tooke the name of Aegiſtus) which made him ſo ſwift of foot, that eueryone did admire him for his nimbleneſſe and quickneſſe in running.
                  Now, concerning the diſeaſes of Nurſes, you ſhall

find more of them, polluted and infected with the french Poxes, and other diſeaſes; than ſound and healthfull. And I haue knowen Nurſes giue little children the French Pockes, who afterwards lying with their owne parents, haue likewiſe infected them.
                  Now what a diſgrace, and what a ſorrow &amp; griefe of hart, this would be to a Mother, if ſuch a chance ſhould happen, I leaue vnto you (faire Ladies) to iudge.
                  And therefore euery Mother ſhould endeauour, by all meanes poſsible (if ſhe be not ſickly, or too tender) to nurſe her child her ſelfe; ſince that nature hath beſtow'd two Paps vpon her, onely for that purpoſe.
                  There are no other Creatures, but giue ſucke to their young ones, and if you do but onely make a ſhew, that you would take them from their dams, what a coyle and ſtir doe they make? If you carrie them away, they will run after you, and neuer leaue, till you haue let go your hold: deſiring rather to looſe their owne liues, than ſuffer their little ones to be carried away.
                  And therefore let Mothers neuer put foorth their children to nurſe (if they themſelues be ſound and healthfull) for feare of being chang'd. So ſhall you be ſure, to haue Children, which will honour and loue you, without ſetling their affections vpon a ſtranger: Then ſhall you not need to make any doubt, but that your Children will be vertuous, and honeſt; not being addicted to any vices, which they may take from their Nurſes: and they ſhall not learne any diſhonest, or vndecent ſpeeches; nor heare any thing that ſhall be either laſciuious, or vnbefitting: then ſhall you be ſure, that your children will be healthfull, ſince they haue been

nouriſh'd with good milke, and not fed with Apples, Peares, Sops, and ſuch like traſh, which is often giuen them, for want of milke. And by this meanes, you ſhall haue faire and goodly children, well brought vp, docile, vertuous, louing, ſtrong, and luſty, without any diſeaſes: Then ſhall you be accounted for Mothers indeed, and not Step-Mothers: and therefore neuer make your excuſes, that you cannot, nor are not able to endure the trouble, and paines; or that your Husbands will not ſuffer you to do ſo.
                  And to conclude, I would haue you imitate Blanche of Caſtile, ſometimes Queene of France, who nurs'd the King St Lewes her ſonne her owne ſelfe; and on a time, as ſhe was out of the way, her child being froward, a great Ladie of the Court gaue him ſucke, to ſtill him, and make him quiet: which comming to the Queenes eare, ſhe preſently tooke the child, and thruſt her finger ſo far downe into his throat, that ſhe made him vomit vp all the milke, he had ſuckt of the ſaid Ladie, being very angry that any woman ſhould giue her child ſucke, but her ſelfe.

                     The Preface.
                     
                        IT is recorded by auncient Hiſtories,Metrop. Salisb. Epiſe. 36. Scolion ad Tertul. lib. 9. de Anim. that there haue beene ſome Children, which haue made a noiſe, and caſt foorth cries being yet in their mothers belly: and for proofe heereof, they relate, that in the City of Raſcat, there was a child borne with two hornes, whoſe moanes, and lamentations were herad fourteene daies before his birth: But this is rather Prodigious then Naturall: as S. Auguſtine ſaith,Aug. lib. 3. de ciuit. Dei. cap. 31
                         For a childe naturally, neither laments nor cries, ſo long as he doth abide in his mothers wombe.
                     
                        And I haue often obſerued, that a child neither cries, nor makes any noiſe, neither ſighes, though he be halfe come foorth, what paine or anguiſh ſoeuer he ſuffers in the paſsing. But as ſoone as he is born, and ſees the light (beſide the alteration of the ayre, which he finds) euen very neceſsity, and his owne feeling, doe force and as it were wring from him cries and moanes, thereby to ſhew, in what need he ſtands of helpe. He craues and demands the ſuccour of his owne Mother to be nouriſht and fed, otherwiſe hee would dye in a ſhort ſpace;Metaph. 10. Martij. Lipom. com. 7.
                         except hee were a ſecond Codratus the Martyr, who was euen from his tender age depriued of all humane aide, and forſaken both of Father and mother, and all the world beſide. But our Lord God did ſupply this want and cauſed in recompence thereof that a round cloud, comming downe from heauen, did encompaſſe him about, and nouriſh him.
                  
                  
                     
                     OF A NVRSE, AND what election, and choice ought to be made of her.
                     CHAP. I.
                     
                        THough it were fit, that euery mother ſhould nurſe her owne child: becauſe her milke which is nothing elſe, but the bloud whitened (of which he was made, and wherwith hee had beene nouriſhed the time hee ſtaide in his Mothers wombe) will bee alwaies more naturall, and familiar vnto him, than that of a ſtranger: and alſo by nurſing him her ſelfe, ſhe ſhall be wholly accounted his mother: yet ſince they may be hindred by ſicknes, or for that they are too weake and tender, or elſe becauſe their Husbands will not ſuffer them, therefore I ſay, it will be very neceſſary to ſeeke out another Nurſe:The difficulty of finding a good nurſe. and euery one knowes how hard a thing it is, to finde a good one, becauſe they haue beene ſo often beguiled, and deceiued therein: which hath giuen mee occaſion, firſt of all to ſhew ſome marks, whereby you may make ſome choiſe of one that is fit.
                     Now, in chuſing of a Nurſe, there are ſixe things

to be conſidered: Her birth and Parentage: her perſon: her behauiour: her mind: her milke: and her child.
                     
                        1. Her Lignage.Firſt, Concerning her Lignage, ſhe muſt come of a good ſtocke, or kinred: there being none of her race, whether it be grandfather, or grandmother, nay, not ſo much as one of her great grandfathers, or ancient progenitors, that hath euer been ſtayned, or ſpotted, either in bodie or mind: For, oftentimes we ſee, though the Parents be healthfull, and ſound, yet their children be ſometimes, either ſickly, or fooles, or elſe viciouſly giuen: who retaine ſuch vices from their grandfather, grandmother, yea, and ſomtimes from their great grandfathers; which troubleth many men, to thinke from whence theſe accidents may proceed: For it is verie certaine, that there are many Children, which are diſeaſed or deformed, either in bodie, or mind, whoſe parents are verie healthfull, and well featur'd: But yet, if you ſearch farther, you ſhall find that ſome of their progenitors haue been affected in the like manner.
                     
                        2. Her Perſon.2. Touching the Nurſes perſon; for her age, ſhe ſhall be choſen, when ſhe is at her full growth, which is about fiue and twentie yeares of age, from which time, to the fiue and thirtieth yeare, is the age, wherein women are moſt temperate, healthfull, ſtrong, and luſty: therefore one ſhall be choſen, that is betweene fiue and twentie, and fiue and thirtie yeares.Her Stature. Now, for her bodie, ſhe ought to be of a middle ſtature, neither too big, nor too little,

nor too fat, nor too leane, nor yet too groſſe, hauing good fleſhy armes, and legges; and her fleſh being hard and firme: ſhe muſt not be deformed, neither ſquint-ey'd, lame, nor crump ſhouldred: ſhe muſt be one that is healthfull, and not ſubiect to any diſeaſe: the complexion and colour of her bodie, muſt be liuely, and roſie: ſhe muſt not be ſpotted with redneſſe,A red hair'd Nurſe diſcommended. and eſpecially ſhe ſhould not haue red haire: and therefore, ſuch as are of a browne complexion, are held to be beſt, whoſe haire is of a cheſt-nut colour, betweene yellow and blacke.
                     She muſt haue a pleaſing countenance,Her Countenance. a bright and cleare eie, a well formed noſe, neither crooked, nor of a bad ſmell, a ruddie mouth, and verie white teeth: She muſt deliuer her words well, and diſtinctly, without ſtammering: and ſhe muſt haue a ſtrong and big necke:A Nurſes perfections. for thereby (as Hippocrates ſaith) may one iudge, of the ſtrength of the bodie. She muſt haue a broad and large breaſt, garniſhed with two Paps of a reaſonable bigneſſe, neither limber, nor hanging downe, but betweene hard and ſoft; full of Azure veines and Arteries, not being either knottie, or ſwolne bigger then they ſhould be: the nipple which is in the midſt of the breaſts, ought to be ſomewhat eminent, and withall a ruddie colour like a Strawberie, it muſt be of a reaſonable bigneſſe and thickneſſe, and of an eaſie draught, that the child may take it the better, and ſucke the eaſier.
                     She muſt not be with child, neither ſhould ſhe

haue her naturall purgings;Hipp. lib. 2. Epidemiar. though Hippocrates ſeemes to allow the contrarie: relating the ſtorie of a Nurſe, whoſe bodie was full of Puſtules, of which ſhe was freed, as ſoone as ſhe had her ordinary ſickneſſe: deſiring (as ſome Interpreters would haue it) to ſhew, that it is not without reaſon, for the Nurſes health, that ſhe ſhould haue her courſes: thereby to coole and cleanſe the bloud, whereof the milke is made.
                     
                        3. Her Manners.3. She ought to be of a good behauiour, ſober, and not giuen either to drinking, or gluttonie, milde, without being angry, or fretfull: for there is nothing that ſooner corrupts the bloud, of which the milke is made, than choller, or ſadneſſe: and therefore ſhe muſt be merry, playing and ſinging to the child, dandling and vſing him gently; and one that will not refuſe to giue him the breaſt at any time, for feare leaſt he crie. She muſt likewiſe be chaſt, not deſiring after her husbands companie, and much leſſe a ſtrangers; becauſe carnal copulation (as Galen ſaith) troubleth the bloud, and ſo by conſequence the milke; alſo it diminiſheth the quantitie thereof, by prouoking the naturall purgations; and alſo makes her haue an ill ſmell, (as Ariſtotle ſaith) becauſe they heat themſelues verie much in this act: and which is worſt, the Nurſe thinking onely to take her ſport a little, may therby prooue with child.
                     
                        4. Her Mind.4. Concerning her mind: Let her be ſage, wiſe, diſcreet, that ſhe may take care of her little one, and not lay him in any place, where he may indanger

himſelfe, to be either ſicke, or ſtifled: For, there are more Nurſes then ſhould be, which are ſuch beaſts, and ſo careleſſe; who hauing their child ſucke in the night, as they lie with them in the bed, do oftentimes fall a ſleep vpon them, and ſo ſtifle them. And ſhe muſt alſo haue diſcretion, to iudge ſomewhat neare, what her little one crieth after, it being not able otherwiſe to expreſſe what it would haue:Gal. de Sanitat. tuenda. Obſeruing (as Galen ſaith) the childs diſpoſition, that ſo ſhe may giue him that, which he craues or deſires, or elſe take away ſuch things as ſhall offend him: playing with him, kiſſing him, dancing him gently in her armes, and ſinging withall: and ſhe muſt likewiſe open him often, to lay and keep him drie and cleane.
                     
                        Of the conditions which are required in good Milke.
                        THe choiſe of good Milke is,The qualitie of good Milke. that it be of a middle ſubſtance, that is to ſay, ſuch as ſhal be neither too watriſh, nor too thicke: For that which is too watriſh and thin, may cauſe the child to haue a ſcowring, and beſides, it yeeldeth no good nutriment: And the Milke which is too thicke, is eaſily crudled, and not ſo ſoone digeſted, and ſo cauſeth obſtructions, from whence the matter of the ſtone is bred. As for the quantitie of Milke:Quantitie of Milke. a Nurſe ſhould rather haue too much, then too little: becauſe when there is but little, it will be hard for the child to draw it; when as if there be plentie, it will

come the eaſier, and euen thruſt out it ſelfe. Moreouer, if the child ſhould ſucke the breaſt drie; then that which ſhall come in the roome of it, cannot be well concocted ſo ſoone: Beſides, if the child ſhould chance to haue an Ague, then would he ſucke, and conſume a great deale. Againe, the Nurſe beſides a ſufficient quantitie for the nouriſ

                            that ſo it may be cooled.
                        
                           The colour of good Milke.As for the colour, it muſt be white, according to the common ſaying: (As white as Milke) for the Milke which is blewiſh, makes ſhew of Melancholy, as the yellow doth of Choller, and the reddiſh, that it is not well concocted, and ſignifies either that there is a weakneſſe in the breaſts, or elſe an ill qualitie of the bloud whereof it is made, which hath not been concocted and corrected by the naturall heat of the paps.
                        
                           The ſmell.Beſides, good Milke ought not to haue any ſtrong ſmell, but rather a ſweet ſent, which ſmelleth neither hote, nor ſower, nor yet aduſt, for ſuch ſmels ſhew, that the bloud, of which it is made, is ouerheated or putride.
                        
                           The taſt.And concerning the Taſt; that Milke which hath a ſweet ſauour is much commended: as contrarywiſe, that which is either ſharp, ſower, or bitter, is to be refuſed, and therefore not choſen for good.
                        
                           A proofe of the goodneſſe of Milke in quantitie.Now the triall there of may be made in this ſort; as to know whether it be of a good ſubſtance: let

the nurſe milke ſome few drops of it, vpon a looking glaſſe, or other ſleeke thing: and if in holding it gently aſide, it flows and runs preſently, and keepe not together a little, then it is a ſigne that the milke is watriſh, and too thinne, If it ſtand ſtill, and will not runne at all, then it ſhews that the milke is too thicke and fat: But if it runne leaſurely, not ſtaying eyther too long, or flowing too ſoone, vpon the ſaid ſmooth body: it ſheweth that the milke is of a middle ſubſtance, and ought to bee reckoned and choſen for the beſt.
                        The quantity of the milke may be knowne thus:A trial of the quantity. if there remaine ſome in the breaſt after the childe hath done ſucking: and againe, if in opening the child you find him bepiſſed: But you muſt haue an eye that your nurſe be none of theſe Cooſeners (for there be ſome) that giue the child water to drinke in ſecret, and others, which wet the childs bed: But ſuch Nurſes deſerue to be whipt, and their knauery may be eaſily deſcried, both by the eye and the ſent and likewiſe diſcerned by the taſt.
                        Now the obſeruation,The choice of a Nurſe by her child. which is taken from the Nurſes child, for the choice of a fit Nurſe, is concerning his age: For if her child be aboue ſeuen or eight months old, then her milke will bee too ſtale afterwards: and beſides it would be a doubt, whether ſhee would haue milke enough to nurſe him, that ſhould be put vnto her.
                        Againe, if the childe be but fifteene daies or a moneth olde, that ſhews, that her milke is too new, and that it is not as yet well purified: becauſe

the mother is not wholly purged and clenſed.
                        
                           
                              Auicen.
                           So Auicen commands, that a child ſhould not be put to ſucke a Woman, till at leaſt two moneths after her deliuery; and at the fartheſt not after eight.
                        And becauſe the ſexe of the Nurſes child muſt likewiſe bee obſerued, Aegineta wiſheth, that it ſhould be rather a man child then a maid child: becauſe the milke is hotter, better concocted; and not ſo excrementitious; And he addeth farther, that it is fit (whether it be a boy or a wench) that the mother haue born her burthen, the full time. For thoſe that are commonly deliuered, before their time, for the moſt part are not ſound, but ſickly: though there be many healthfull women, which goe with their children but ſeuen Moneths.
                     
                  
                  
                     How a Nurſe ought to order her ſelfe, concerning her Dyet, and manner of life. CHAP. II.
                     
                     
                        IT is not enough that a Nurſe be indowed with the conditions and qualities aforeſaid: but it is very fit alſo that ſhee maintaine and preſerue them: wherefore wee will ſet downe briefely, how, and in what manner, ſhe ought to gouerne her ſelfe.
                     Firſt of all therefore let her ſhun, and auoide all bad ayre, and all kind of ill and ſtinking ſmels: for

ſuch ſents as are too ſtrong, are naught and hurtfull for her, becauſe they infect and ouer-heat the ſpirits, and bloud, whereof the milke is made:What meat a nurſe muſt refrain from. Shee muſt likewiſe auoide all meats, that are eyther too much ſalted, or ſpiced, or of a ſtrong taſt, as Onions, Leekes, Garlicke, Muſtard, and all kind of Baked Meates, and old cheeſe: Let her eate Veale, Mutton, Chicken, Kid, Partridge, and ſuch like meates which are of good iuice, and of eaſy digeſtion:What meates ſhe ſhall vſe. and ſhe muſt vſe them in moderate ſort, without glutting her ſelfe.
                     All ſorts of fiſh are hurtfull for her, except it bee in ſmall quantity: ſhee may eate Iacke, Sole, and Quauluer; and if ſhe eat no fiſh let her vſe new laid egges.
                     Her meate muſt be rather boyled, then roſted, but yet there muſt be had a reſpect to the habitude and complexion of the child: For if hee bee very moiſt and flegmaticke, then the Nurſe ſhall rather vſe roſtmeat: and ſo of other complexions.
                     Her bread ſhall be of good wheate, well made,Her Bread. light, and baked as it ought to be.
                     Let her put into her pottages, Lettuce, Sorrell,Her broth. Purcelaine, Borage, Bugloſſe, and Succory.
                     Shee ſhall refraine from all kind of raw fruits.
                     For her drinke, let her take Ale, or Beere;Her drinke. A kinde of drinke which they vſe in France which they call Bouchet. Ariſtotle.
                         and where that cannot be had, Barley water; or water ſodden; or elſe a ſmall kind of Hydromel or meade which hath but a little Cinamon in it.
                     But I would rather counſaile them, to drinke Wine and Water together. Ariſtotle forbids wine,

both to the nurſe and the child, except it be (as they ſay) well chriſtned.
                     
                        Her exerciſe.She muſt vſe moderate exerciſe, and chiefly before meales: For moderate exerciſe, doth ſtrengthen the naturall heate, and conſumeth all ſuperfluities. The parts which ought to be moſt exerciſed, ſhould be rather the vppermoſt, as the ſhoulders, and armes: becauſe that the exerciſing of them, makes the bloud &amp; ſpirits the ſooner aſcend into the breaſts.
                     
                        Her ſleepe.For her ſleepe that cannot bee either limited or preſcribed: becauſe the Nurſe is oftentimes conſtrained to watch, when the child is eyther froward or ſicke. And therefore ſhe muſt take her reſt when ſhe may, whether it be in the day, or in the night, as the child will giue her leaue.
                     Her belly muſt be alwaies looſe, and if it chance to be bound, ſhee may take a Cliſter. Let her vſe Broths, Prunes, and Apples well ſodden, that ſo ſhe may keepe her ſelfe ſoluble.
                     She muſt ſhun all diſquietnes of mind, and ſhee muſt bee merry and pleaſant, neyther vexing, nor grieuing, nor too chollericke.
                  
                  
                     The care which a Nature muſt haue of all the parts of the childs body. CHAP. III.
                     
                     THe Nurſe ſhould be choſen a month or two before the woman be deliuered, that ſhe may alwaies haue an eye ouer her, and her child, and

then as ſoone as the Woman ſhall bee brought a-bed, and that the childe hath paſſed through the hands of the Midwife, or keeper, and is ſwathed by them he ſhall be deliuered to the nurſe to giue him ſucke, and haue a care of him.
                     Firſt of all, let the Nurſe conſider and view al the parts of the childs body, beginning at the head, obſeruing whether it be well faſhioned or no: that if it chance to haue any ill forme, or figure; that then it may be mended as well as it may, which ſhall be done by bringing the ſaid head vnto the forme of a boule, a little preſſed and made flat on both ſides:How to faſhion the childs head. in ſuch ſort that neyther the forepart, nor hinderpart of the head, ſtand too farre out, nor yet be too flat: which ſhall be done with ſuch head-cloths, as they vſe commonly to weare, ſtroking it by little and little, without much preſſing or cruſhing it, as ſome Nurſes do: but onely handling it in a milde and gentle faſhion.
                     Vpon the Mould of the head you ſhal lay a peece of kotton orkerſey: ſome vſe to lay a peece of ſcarlet.
                     The eares muſt bee cleanſed:The childs eares muſt be cleanſed. with little rags made like tents: and the Nurſe muſt looke whether the holes be well made, that there may not remain any filth eyther within, or in the wrinkles and folds behind them. And as Rhaſis ſaith, the eares muſt be a little preſſed to the head, that they may not hang downe.
                     Let the eares alſo bee wrapped about with fine linnen clouts, that they may not bee ouer heated,

and ſo ſticke to the head, by the meanes of ſome groſſe matter, or ſweat which commonly is bredde there.
                     
                        The eyes clenſed.But aboue all, the eyes muſt be looked vnto and wiped with a fine linnen cloth, eſpecially about both the corners, that if there ſhould chance to be any filth gathered in thoſe places, it may be taken away. Auicen puts there a little virgin oyle, becauſe it mitigateth and taketh away the roughneſſe and nitroſity which might remaine about the childs eyes, through his long ſwimming and lying in his owne ſweat and Vrine, while he was in his mothers wombe. I haue ſeene in ſome children, that (after they haue bene borne) there hath runne out of the corner of the eye, many daies together thick drops of bloud, which congealed preſently. There are many children likewiſe borne bleare ey'd, for the helping whereof, the Nurſe ſhall vſe to annoint the corners of the eyes with a little Vnguentum Tutiae, and likewiſe ſpirt a little of her milke into them.
                     
                        The noſe muſt be clenſed.Now concerning the childs noſe, it is fit, that it ſhould be opened, and dilated gently, waſhing and cleanſing it with a little warme water. The ſame Auicen bids, that it ſhould bee annointed with a little Virgin Oyle, which muſt bee done with the top of ones finger, the nayles being pared very neer and euen. And if you chaunce to find ſome little membrane, or skinne, that ſtops vp the holes, and paſſage thereof, it ſhall be cut aſunder, that there may bee a paſſage for the excrements of the braine.
                     
                        And for as much as the head of a childe aboundeth with ſtore of moiſture, (as Galen writeth) which is purged and voided by the mouth, noſe, and other paſſages: therefore it will be very fit that the Nurſe haue a care to the taking of them away for feare leſt by their ſtay, they eyther fall down vpon the lungs, or into the ſtomacke,For the clenſing of the mouth. or elſe grow to be dryed, which happening the Nurſe muſt put her finger being annointed with honey, to the bottom of the childs mouth, and rub it aboue and vnder the tongue, which ſhee may doe alſo with Sirup of Violets.
                     Beſides ſhee ſhall looke whether the fundament bee well opened, and whether there bee any filth bred there or no: as alſo, whether the paſſage of the yard be free: and if it be a wench,Care to bee had of the fundament. whether there be any membrane, that doth ſtop vp the entrance: Not long ſince, I made a new paſſage in a little childe, who had the hole of his yard growne, and as it were glued together: and an other boy, which had the ſtring of his yard ſo ſhort and ſtraight, that it made the head of it (called Balanus) bow downward, and ſeemed as though it had no paſſage, but as ſoone as I had cut the ſtring, the yard came to the right faſhion.
                     And concerning the membrane which ſomtimes ſtops the paſſage: I haue made inciſion of the like membrans, in three girles, and lately in the daughter of M. Iames Boyzard.

with little ſwaths, &amp; fit boulſters, made for the purpoſe: as likewiſe if eyther the back bone, or the belly, do ſtand out. But for theſe they muſt repaire vnto a Chirurgion: who muſt ſhew and inſtruct the Nurſe how ſhe ought to proceed herein, when ſhe ſhifts the child.

                         becauſe the bones (through their ſoftnes &amp; tendernes) are more eaſily made ſtraight and are apter to be ſet in their right place &amp; forme, then when they are growne dryer: it being then very hard to amend ſuch errors, as the ſame Galen ſaith.

                     How the Nurſe muſt ſhift the child. CHAP. IIII.
                     
                     
                        WE muſt not onely haue a regard, to ſuch defects of Nature, as the child may bring with him from his mothers wombe, and cure them: but we muſt alſo looke, and haue an eye, that the Nurſe, or ſhee that ſwathes, and dreſſeth him, doe not make him worſe: and of a well faſhioned child, in all the parts of his body, do not make him deformed or miſhapen, and ſo ſpoile him. For in ſwathing the child, moſt commonly they bind and cruſh him ſo hard, that they make him grow crooked. Some ſwath all the childs body hard to make him haue a goodly necke, and to make him

ſeeme the fatter: but this cruſhing makes his breſt and the ribs which are faſtned to the back-bone, to ſtand out; ſo that they are bended, and draw the Vertebrae to them, which makes the backe bone, to bend and giue out eyther inwardly, or outwardly, or elſe on the one ſide: and that cauſeth the childe to be eyther crump-ſhouldred, or crooked breſted, or elſe to haue one of his ſhoulders ſtand farther out then the other, ſome alſo bind the hips ſo hard that they become very ſmal, and that hinders them from growing and waxing big. Which doth much harme, eſpecially to maids,Inconuenience of hard ſwathing the hips. who ſhould haue large hips, that when they come to age, they may bring foorth goodly children.
                     
                        Galen hath obſerued,
                           Gal. decaus. morber.
                         that the too ſtraight and hard binding or cruſhing of the hams, and legges of little children, when they are ſwathed, doth make them grow crooked legged and they will remaine, as the Latines call it Vari or Valgi; going either inward or outward with their knees. This imperfection may alſo happen through the Nurſes fault, by carrying the childe alwaies vpon one arme, and the ſame ſide: and by holding the childs knees hard towards her, making them ſtand like a bow: For the preuenting of which miſchances, the Nurſes ſhall carry their children, ſometimes on the right ſide, and ſometimes on the left. And they muſt likewiſe ſwath them, but looſely, ſtretching downe their armes, all along their ſides, without binding or cruſhing them hard together.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of the childs cradle, and how it is to be placed; and alſo how the child ought to be laide when he goes to ſleepe. CHAP. V.
                     
                     
                        WHen the child ſhall bee thus dreſſed, and ſwathed, it will then be fit to let him ſleepe and take ſome reſt, for which purpoſe he muſt be laid in his cradle: fitted with a little mattreſſe, which ſhall be laid deepe to the bottome, that the ſides of the cradle may be a great deale aboue the mattreſſe; that ſo the childe may as it were ſinke downe in his cradle for feare leaſt he fall out of it. Then vpon the Mattreſſe ſhal be laid a pillow,How to order the Cradle. that is ſomwhat ſoft, to lay the childe vpon, letting him lye the firſt month vpon his backe: but afterwards when hee is waxed a little bigger let him lye ſometimes on his right ſide,How to lay the child. and ſometimes on the left, hauing his head a little raiſed vp, that the excrements of his braine may the more eaſily flow and paſſe through the emunctoryes thereof: And hee muſt bee bound and tyed in with ſtrings, leaſt in rocking him, he fall out of his Cradle. At the head of the Cradle let there bee a little Arch made of wood, or Ozier to lay a couerlet ouer it, thereby to keepe away the wind, and that no duſt fall vpon him. But it would be more conuenient (for thoſe that can fitly haue it) to ſet the Cradle within a little

bed, the Curteynes drawne round about it.
                     Now,The place where the Cradle ſhall be ſet. concerning the place where the Cradle muſt ſtand, it will be verie fit, that it be in a chamber that is neither too light, nor to darke, nor too hote, nor too cold: For if it be too light, it ſpends the ſpirits of the ſight, and hindreth the child from ſleeping: if it be too darke, it makes him deſire the light, and cauſes him to be melancholike: if it be too hote, it will ſtifle him, &amp; make him apt to catch cold, when he comes into the aire: if it be too cold, it brings him to a murre, or ſtopping in the head: and therefore it will be beſt to keep a meane in all of them: And eſpecially you muſt haue a care, that the Cradle, and bed, ſtand not neare the dore, chimney, or windowes, that the light do not draw the childs ſight awrie, and ſo make him prooue to be ſquint-ey'd: and therefore the fire, or the candle muſt be ſet right againſt his eyes: For if they were on either ſide, the glimpſe will make the child turne and role his eye aſide, to follow the light, and ſo the vſe and motion, which the Muſcles would get therby, may make him either ſquint or goggle-ey'd.
                     Oftentimes the child cannot ſleep after he is laid downe, and therefore he muſt be gently rock'd, to inuite him thereto, and not haſtily or too faſt, for feare of making the milke flote in his ſtomackes; and his Nurſe ſhall ſing by him, becauſe ſinging prouokes ſleepe, and keepes him from crying.
                     Till the childe be two yeere old, he may ſleepe at all times whenſoeuer he will, yea he may fall aſleepe at his mothers teat as hee is ſucking: and if

you would obſerue the ſpace of time for ſleeping which the Ancients did, it muſt be thus: Till the childe be three or foure yeeres old, let him ſleepe more then wake. But according to Galen, he ought heerein not to exceed mediocritie, otherwiſe it is dangerous: for long ſleeping cooleth and moiſtneth the braine, and there retaines ſuperfluities. And Auicen ſaith, that it doth be-numme and beſot the childs ſenſes, and makes him dull and lumpiſh.
                  
                  
                     When the Mother her ſelfe, or the Nurſe, ought to giue the child ſucke, and how, and how much. CHAP. VI.
                     
                     
                        IT is verie fit that either the Mother, or ſome other Nurſe for her, do giue the child ſucke after he is borne: if it be the Mother her ſelfe, it muſt not be at the ſooneſt, vntill eight daies after her deliuerie: Some alſo are of opinion, that the mother her ſelfe, ſhould not giue her child ſucke in the month, by reaſon ſhe hath been troubled and tir'd in her lying in: and becauſe ſhe is not as yet, well cleans'd and purified of her after-purgings, which commonly laſt a moneth, as Hippocrates ſaith: In which ſpace ſhe ſhall let little prettie whelpes ſucke her breaſts, to make her milke come the better, and that it goe not away.
                     Some women do make their keepers draw their breaſts, and others draw them with glaſſes themſelues:

Beſides, Auicen commands, that a woman ſhould not giue her child ſucke, vntill ſhe be well recouer'd. Now, you know that ſome are well ſooner, and ſome later, and ſo there can be no time limited or preſcribed: But aboue all it muſt be obſerued, (as the ſame Authour ſaith) that the Nurſe do not giue the child ſucke, after ſhe is riſen, before ſhe hath milked foorth ſome of her milke: And likewiſe, ſhe ſhall not giue him the breaſt, if by chance ſhe hath ouer heated her ſelfe, either by ſome exerciſe, or elſe with going, till firſt ſhe be come into a good temper, and well cool'd.
                     Now, in giuing him ſucke,The manner how to giue the child ſucke. ſhe ſhall obſerue this order: She muſt ſometimes ſpirt ſome of her milke, either vpon the childs lips, or elſe into his mouth; and when he hath left the nipple, ſhe muſt cruſh her breaſt a little, that he may draw and ſucke with leſſe labour, and ſhe muſt be carefull, that he ſwallow not downe too much at a time, and that the milke come not out againe at the noſe: Beſides, ſhe muſt ſometimes take away the teat, and giue it him againe, that he ſucke not too much at once, and too greedily.
                     It is verie hard to ſet downe,What quantitie of milke the child may ſucke. the quantitie of milke that a child ſhould take; But therein the nurſe muſt haue a reſpect to the age, complexion, temper, and to the deſire which the child hath to ſucke, increaſing it, as the child groweth, or according as he is thirſtie, either through ſome ſickneſſe, or when his teeth come foorth: for at thoſe times he is more drie, then otherwiſe. Now to know how

often the child ſhould ſucke in a day: Paulus Aegineta appoints, that it ſhould be twiſe a day, or thriſe at the moſt: which he meaneth for the firſt foure, or fiue daies, that he may be acquainted therewith by little and little, and alſo becauſe there is then no great need. I haue ſeen children that haue not ſucked in two or three daies, after they were borne; for they know not then, whether they are yet in their Mothers belly, or no: where they ſuck'd not at all;
                           Hippocrat. lib. de princip.
                         although that Hippocrates ſaith, that the child receiues ſome nouriſhment by the mouth, while he is in his Mothers belly. It can neither be told nor limitted how often he ought to ſucke in a day; becauſe it is fit he ſhould haue the teat, as often as he crieth: yet let it be but a little at a time, becauſe the ſtomacke at firſt is but weake. And if he wrangles but a little, it will be beſt to ſtill him, either with rocking, or ſinging: And though he be not quieted, or ſtilled, a little crying can doe him no great harme, but rather may ſerue for ſome good vſe: For it makes him runne at Noſe, ſhed teares, and ſpit: it purgeth his braine, yea, and ſtirreth vp his naturall heat, and alſo dilates the paſſages of the breaſt. But if he cry too violently, and eagerly, it may do him much harm, and cauſe him to be burſten, or breake ſome veſſell in his breaſt, or elſe bring the head-ach.
                  
                  
                     
                     How the child muſt be made cleane, after he is awake and vnſwathed. CHAP. VII.
                     
                     
                        AFter the Child hath well ſuck'd, and ſlept, the Nurſe muſt ſhift him, and make him cleane: For which purpoſe the Nurſe, or ſome other, muſt ſit neere the fire, laying out her legges at length, hauing a ſoft pillow in her lap, the dores and windowes being cloſe ſhut, and hauing ſomething about her, that may keep the wind from the child. And when ſhe is thus accommodated, ſhe ſhall vnſwath and ſhift him drie. If he be verie foule, ſhe may waſh him with a little water and wine luke warme, with a ſpunge or linnen cloth.
                     The time of ſhifting him is commonly about ſeuen a clocke in the morning, then againe at noone, and at ſeuen a clocke at night: and it would not be amiſſe, to change him againe about midnight; which is not commonly done. But becauſe there is no certaine howre, either of the childs ſucking, or ſleeping: therefore diuers, after he hath ſlept a good while, do euery time ſhift him: leaſt he ſhould foule and bepiſſe himſelfe. And ſurely there be many children, that had need to be ſhifted, as ſoone as they haue foul'd themſelues: which I would counſaile you to doe, and not to let them lie in their filth.
                     
                        When you change his bed, you ſhall rub all his bodie ouer, with an indifferent fine linnen cloth: and then his head muſt be rub'd, and made cleane: and when he is foure or fiue moneth old, his head may be cleans'd with a fine bruſh: and when he is growen bigger, let it be comb'd.
                  
                  
                     What cloths and coats the child muſt haue, and at what time. CHAP. VIII.
                     
                     
                        AS ſoone as the childe is ſomewhat growne, and that hee cannot well keepe his hands ſwathed in, and hid any longer, (which is commonly about the twentieth or thirtieth day, according as he is in ſtrength) then muſt hee haue little ſleeues, that hauing his armes and hands at liberty, hee may vſe and ſtirre them: and then the Nurſe ſhall begin to carry him abroad, ſo that it be faire weather, to ſport and exerciſe him, not carrying him out into the raine, or into the hot ſunne, nor when there is any rough wind.
                     And therfore he muſt be kept in the ſhade auoiding all ill ayres, as of ſinkes and the like: And if he ſhould chance to bee frighted with any thing, the Nurſe ſhal endeuor to take away the apprehenſion thereof, and harten him, without making him afraid. I haue ſeen ſome children, that with a fright, haue fallen into the Epilepſye or falling ſicknes, the

Phyſitions not being able to giue any other reaſon thereof, but onely the feare he had taken.
                     If by chance he doth cry and weepe, then ſhall you endeuour by all meanes to ſtill him, and not let him cry, obſeruing diligently what it is he cries for, and what may be the cauſe thereof: that as Galen ſaith, he may haue that he deſireth, or elſe be ridde of that which offends and troubleth him.
                     But the ſame Author ſaith,
                           Gal. de Sanit. tuenda.
                         that children generally are ſtilled and quieted by three meanes: by giuing them the breaſt, by rocking, and by ſinging to them: They may be alſo ſtilled by giuing them ſomething to holde in their hand, or by making them looke vpon ſomwhat that pleaſeth them, as alſo by carrying them abroad.
                     About the eighth, or ninth month, or at fartheſt when the child is a yeare old, he muſt haue coates, and not be kept ſwathed any longer. And if it bee Sommer, he muſt be coated ſooner becauſe of the heate, which makes the body oftentimes, to be full of wheales and pimples. And ſome may haue coats ſooner, according as their ſtrength will ſuffer it; of which an eſpeciall care muſt be had. And chiefly the Nurſe muſt let him haue a hat, that may be eaſie and large enough, which may couer all the forepart of the head, without beeing curious (as they ſay commonly) to make him haue a goodly high forhead.

                        THe childe muſt bee nouriſhed with milk only,
                           Gal. lib. 1. de ſanitate tuenda
                         till his foreteeth be come forth both aboue, and beneath: as Galen writeth: for beeing nothing elſe yet but as it were milke it is very fit and probable that hee ſhould bee nouriſhed with no other foode:The childs foode. Beſides the teeth are chiefly ordained by nature, onely to chaw: and therefore when he hath none, he ought not to be fed with any ſolide meat. But as ſoone as they are come forth it ſheweth that Nature hath giuen him thoſe inſtruments, to make vſe of them: and therefore hee may then take more ſolide meate, if you thinke he can digeſt it. For to giue him any other nouriſhment, then milke or diſh-meate, before hee haue teeth, it might breede great ſtore of crude humors, and winds, which oftentimes (as Auicen ſaith) doe cauſe the child to haue bunches, or contuſions, about his backe bone, .and ribs. Neuertheleſſe, though his teeth bee come, yet muſt you not giue him meat, that is too ſolide, or in too great quantitie: but at the beginning, you may giue him ſops of bread, or Panado, or Gruell: afterward he may ſuck the leg of a Chicken, the greateſt part of the fleſh being taken away, that he may the better pull, and

gnaw it, and this is but once or twice a day, &amp; that too, when he is almoſt ready to be weaned (as Rhaſis ſaith.) And this alſo doth ſerue to whet and rub his gummes which about that time begin to itch. And when hee is fifteene moneths olde, or a little more, then may you giue him the fleſh of a Capon, or of Partridge minced and mingled with ſome broth, made either of Veale, Mutton, or Chicken, adding thereto ſome ſops of bread. For the Ancient writers forbid, that wee ſhould giue them any ſtore of meate, before they are two yeares old: becauſe they are not able to chaw, and digeſt it, and alſo for that they haue not ſo much neede of nouriſhment; And therefore you muſt ſtay till you haue weaned him, before you feede him more plentifully.
                  
                  
                     When the child ought to he weaned. CHAP. X.
                     
                     
                        IT is a very hard thing to ſet downe a certaine time, when a child ought to be weaned; Notwithſtanding if we wil beleeue Paulus Aegineta, and Auicen, he muſt be weaned, when he is two yeares old, and hath all his teeth come foorth. Now in ſome they come foorth ſooner, and in others later: and to weane him before they are come foorth, might be an occaſion, to make him haue many diſeaſes.
                     Wherefore to know certainely when a childe

ſhould be weaned, and that he ſhould wholy feed vpon other meat, it muſt firſt be obſerued, whether he take his meat well; and if hee be able to chaw it thoroughly: whether he be ſickly or elſe ſtrong and luſty.
                     Concerning the time and ſeaſon of the yeare it muſt be when the wether is neither too hot, nor too cold: and therfore the fitteſt time will be the ſpring or in Autumn. But ſomtimes there is neceſſity to wean him at another time, yea &amp; before two yeares, by reaſon that his nurſe may chance to bee ſickly, and that he being come to ſome knowledge will not ſucke another. It may alſo happen that the child is to be weaned before he be two yeares, old for that the milke (although otherwiſe it bee good) doth curdle and grow ſower in his ſtomacke, which requireth ſtronger meate.
                     Now to weane a childe well, let them obſerue this methode following: Firſt the teat ſhall not be wholy taken from him, but hee ſhall ſucke a little, and eate a little meate; and ſo continue for a few daies: then afterwards hee ſhall not ſucke in the day time, though in the night, they may giue him a little. Neuertheleſſe, it will be very fit in the morning, when he is awake and hath been ſhifted and dreſſed, to giue him ſucke a little, and then to let him ſtay two or three houres before hee take any thing, afterward to giue him ſomwhat to dinner, as ſome pottage, or panade, with a little fleſh minced, or cut very ſmall, and then let him ſtay two houres without giuing him any thing, at which time you

may giue him a little ſucke, and lay him to ſleepe: And when hee is wakened and hath beene made cleane, then the Nurſe ſhall carry him abroad into the aire, if it be faire wether, and giue him ſucke, and then lay him to ſleepe againe, without letting him eate any ſolide meate, or very little. At his dinner they ſhal giue him to drinke a little boyled water: and this order ſhall bee kept a whole moneth,That is in France, where they haue not Ale or beere. and when hee ſhall bee accuſtomed to eate ſolide meate then the teate ſhall bee quite taken from him.
                     It happens oftentimes that the child will not forſake the breaſts, but ſtill cryeth and is very eager after it, and then you muſt make him loath it, annointing the Nurſes breaſt with Muſtard, or elſe rubbing the top of the nipple with a little Aloes, and likewiſe make him aſhamed of it.

And in their ſecond age (which is when their teeth begin to come) they are troubled with itching of the gums and chiefely when the dog teeth come foorth, and thoſe are moſt troubled therewithall, which are more fat, and fleſhy, and which are bound in their belly. But becauſe there are many other diſeaſes that they are ſubiect vnto, whether it be that they bring them from their mothers wombe, with them, or that they happen to them afterwards: therefore I will briefly ſpeak of them all, beginning firſt with thoſe that doe moſt trouble them.
                  
                  
                     How ſome diſeaſes may happen vnto little Children in comming foorth of their mothers wombe. CHAP. XII.
                     
                     THere be diuers accidents which happen vnto little children, and at their time of comming

into the world. Some receiuing bruiſes, and hurts, either in the head or other parts of their body, through ſtriuing and ſtraining in the deliuery; as Aches, or breaking of an arme, leg, or thigh: which I haue often ſeene in a difficult trauaile. The latter muſt be helped by ſetting the bones againe in their right place, whether it bee that they were out of ioint, or elſe broken, and then bind them, and keepe them ſo till they be well grown together, and haue taken firme hold.
                     As for hurts and bruiſes, they muſt bee bathed with ſome fomentation, made of Roſes, Melilot, &amp; Chamomil flowers, and then annointed with Saint Iohns Wort and Roſes, mingled together.
                     
                        Mad. Maheu was deliuered of a childe ſo bruiſed and torne, that euery one iudged him to bee dead, hee was ſo blacke: whom I dreſſed and looked vnto, &amp; with the foreſaid medicine I healed him perfectly. But the worſt is, when there happeneth any hurt about the childs head, by meanes whereof, there comes ſome great ſwelling tumor, full of bloud, which may be taken improperly for the Hydrocephalo. If it be but ſmall, then it may bee reſolued with the former fomentation and liniment and ſome plaſters of Diacalciteos, and Diachilon Ireatum mingled together. But if the ſwelling be much and big, then muſt we not think to heale it by reſolution, as Maſter Pietrae, &amp; I my ſelfe ſaw a Chirurgion, who was very confident, and did aſſure himſelfe, to make it reſolue only with new waxe ſpread and laid vpon it. But in the end we were conſtrained

to launce the humor, and in few daies, it was perfectly healed vnder my hands.
                  
                  
                     Of the greatneſſe and ſwelling of the head which happens to little Children. CHAP. XIII.
                     
                     
                        IT chaunceth oftentimes, that the childs head after he is born, is bigger then naturally it ought to bee, an accident which is very dangerous, and hard to be cured: whereof there bee three kinds.
                     The firſt is called of the Greekes, Macrocephalos, which is, when the head is bigger then naturally it ſhould be: and yet this comes naturally, as when the bones of the head bee large, and of great compaſſe containing great ſtore of brayne, and proportioned to the compaſſe and circuit of them, there being neither winde, nor waters, nor any other humors, that are the cauſe thereof. Nature hauing thus proportioned it: and it is ſo heauy and vnwildy, that the child cannot hold it vpright, his necke beeing conſtrained to bow vnder it, with the very waight, ſo that it had neede to bee prop't vp with ſome thing or other: Now there is contrary to this another which is called Microcephalos that is a little head, ſuch a one had Therſites the Grecian and one Triboulet who was a French man. Both theſe accidents

are very hard to bee cured, yea almoſt impoſſible.
                     The ſecond kind is called Hydrocephalos, which is, when the head becomes big, by reaſon of ſome waters therein contained. Of the which there are diuers ſorts: for either the waters are contained betweene the skin, and the Pericraneum; or betwixt the Pericraneum and the bone; or betweene the bone and the membranes, called Dura mater, and Pia mater: Some of them are particular, and poſſeſſe but onely one part of the head; others are generall and affect it wholy.
                     Some of them haue their ſpring and beginning,The Cauſe. euen from the Mothers wombe: which hapneth when the Mother, while ſhee was with childe, through an ill Diet, gathered ſtore of crudities and raw humours, whereof there is bred a watriſh and flegmatike bloud, with the which the child being fed, and not being able to digeſt, or conſume it, much leſſe to euacuate and void it by the paſſages appointed by nature, the watriſh matter gathers it ſelfe together in the head.
                     It may alſo proceed from the child, being not well purg'd of the ſuperfluities which are gathered in his braine, and diffuſed ouer all the head, or part thereof: whereunto we may adde the ill nouriſhment which the child receiueth from his Nurſe, whoſe milke is either ſerous and watriſh, or ouer-heated, which cauſeth diuers vapours, to aſcend vp into the braine, which are there conuerted into watriſh humors.
                     
                        The third kind is called Phiſocephalos, when there chanceth to be a wind, which runneth betweene the skin of the head, and the bone; and alſo betweene the skull, and dura mater; which cauſeth the head to be ſo ſwolne, and puft vp, (as Auicen ſaith) that there haue been diuers children which haue dyed of it; the bones of the head being verie much thruſt outward, which is verie painfull: And certainly, there is nothing that cauſeth greater diſtention, or more paine, then when there is ſome wind incloſed, in what part ſoeuer it be of the bodie.
                     The watrie ſwelling hath almoſt the like cauſes, by reaſon of ſome watriſh matter, that is bred in the braine, which through the weakneſſe of the naturall heat, cannot well be diſperſed, and ſo it is turned into wind: or elſe through ſome vapours, which ariſe from the neather parts, which do alſo diſtend, and ſtretch out the parts of the head.
                     They are all of them different one from another: for the Macrocephalos, or great headed, yeelds not any impreſſion when it is cruſh'd, becauſe it is the bones which make it ſo big and ſwolne: but in the watriſh ſwelling, the finger enters eaſily, and leaues an impreſſion as an O Edema doth: But if you preſſe the windy ſwelling, it leaues no marke, or print, but preſently it riſeth vp againe like a foot-ball.
                     Now, to know whether the water be contained betwixt the bones of the head, and the membranes of the braine: it may eaſilie be diſcerned by the paine, and by the accidents: as if there happen any

                        Vertigo, or Epilepſy, to the child, and that he ſleep, little, or not at all; as alſo his continuall crying doth witneſſe it.
                     The Cure of the windie ſwelling ſhall be performed,The cure of Phiſocephalos.
                         by appointing the Nurſe to keep a good Diet, vſing meates that ſhall neither breed wind, nor crudities.
                     Concerning outward medicines,Outward medicines. it is good to vſe Fomentations: for ſuch kind of medicines ſurely may do him verie much good, if the wind be contain'd between the skin, and the Pericraneum, or betwixt the Pericraneum, and the skull. But if the ſaid wind be incloſed betweene the skull, and dura mater, it will be a verie difficult diſeaſe to be cured, (except the wind be but in ſmall quantitie.) The Fomentation is this.

                     You muſt likewiſe applie the Magiſtrall emplaſter de Bettonica. Some take Snayles, ſhels and all, and beat them, putting vnto them a little powder of Bettonie, and of the rootes of Ireos.
                     And if theſe medicines profit not, as indeed it is verie hard they ſhould: then muſt you determine to open it.
                     
                        The ancient Writers, as Rhaſis, makes no queſtion to applie thereto ſome gentle Cautery; others do rather counſaile, that it ſhould be open'd with a launcet: For mine owne part, I haue practiz'd both waies, without any ill accident, when that the waters haue been contained betweene the skin, and the Pericranium, or betweene the Pericranium and the skull: But to ſay the truth, when the waters is betweene the bones, and the membranes of the braine; though my ſelfe I haue been verie carefull in dreſſing of it: and not long ſince, being ioined with Monſ. Pietre, a ſworne Chirurgion of Paris; yet the ſucceſſe hath not been according as we deſir'd; And therefore, the cure of it muſt not be taken in hand, but with foretelling of the danger.
                  
                  
                     Other imperfections, that accompanie the Child, when he is borne: as excreſcences of fleſh, the roofe of the mouth cleft, a hare lip, and ſupernumerarie fingers. CHAP. XIIII.
                     
                     
                        WEe ſee many times, that the Child brings with him into the world diuers other imperfections, and effects: As I ſaw a child of one Peter Ferot, who had a little piece of fleſh, which hung in the middle of his chin, like vnto a little ſauſage, of the bigneſſe of a quill, and halfe as long: and I

tyed it about with a thread, and cured it quickly. I did the like alſo another time, being accompanied with Monſ. Portall, to a ſonne of Monſ. de Saint Gille, who had as it were a little cherrie hanging at the end of his eare.
                     I haue ſeen three little children newly borne, (and among the reſt,The roofe of the mouth cleft. I ſaw one, being with Monſ. Hautin of Paris, ordinarie Phyſicion to the King, who was the ſonne of Monſ. de Cheary:) all theſe three children had the roofe of their mouth cleft and diuided, euen to the bottome of the Noſe: by meanes whereof they could not ſucke: becauſe it is neceſſarie for one that will ſucke well, to haue the aire cloſed in the mouth, and not to be diſſipated and loſt: which a child that hath a cleft pallet, cannot do: becauſe the aire doth ſpread it ſelfe abroad, and gets out by the pallet ot the mouth and the noſe. Neuertheleſſe, I haue ſeen little children, that haue been nouriſh'd by a ſucking bottle, the ſpace of two or three moneths: but at length they haue died: becauſe the milke ran out by the noſe, it being a verie hard thing, to make an artificiall pallet, that ſhould keep it from going foorth: Neuertheleſſe, I would counſaile the Chirurgion to make one, and to fit it with a little ſpunge tyed to it, which ſhall be put handſomely into the ſaid cleft with the pallet: and it muſt be put in when the child would ſucke, and then taken out againe when he hath done. And this haue I practized with good ſucceſſe.
                     
                        The hare lip.The clouen Lip, called a hare lip, doth often

happen vnto children: but the chiefeſt point is, to know whether it ſhould be cured betimes, or elſe ſtay longer before it be taken in hand. I was once preſent at a Conſultation, for a great Lords ſonne, who was brought hither from beyond the Sea, for me to take him in hand, and cure him: Sixe Phyſicions and Chirurgions were of opinion, that the cure ſhould be defer'd longer, (becauſe the child was not aboue foure or fiue moneths old.) Notwithſtanding, it was put in practize contrarie to their opinion, but the childs life was indangered thereby: And to ſay the truth, it is fitter to prolong and defer the practize of it, vntill the child haue ſome more diſcretion: for otherwiſe there is danger, leaſt the points of the needles be broken, either by the childs crying, or ſucking, or elſe in rubbing himſelfe:A hyſtoric. as I haue knowen it happen vnto ſome, their fleſh being verie ſoft and tender: Beſides, the operation is hard to be done, by reaſon of the childs impatience, hauing no diſcretion, or knowledge, (the which hapned to the foreſaid Lord:) And alſo, for that it growes not a whit the worſe, for the deferring it, till the child haue more vnderſtanding and iudgement.
                     If the child ſhould haue a finger, or a toe,Extraordinarie number of fingers. aboue the ordinarie number, as there be ſome which haue ſixe, whether it be in the hand, or on the feet: this deformitie hapning, I thinke it beſt, that it be taken away, as ſoone as the child is growen any thing big: Which I haue done,A ſtorie. to an honeſt Gentle-womans ſonne, who had two thumbes, which came

vnto him, as his Mother told me, by marking and beholding earneſtly her Vintager, who had two thumbes, as he told money into her hand when ſhe reckoned with him, whereat ſhe tooke an exceeding pleaſure, and delight, to ſee him wagge the ſaid thumbes, in that manner.
                  
                  
                     Of the diſeaſes which happen in the Eies, Eares, and Noſe, of little Children. CHAP. XV.
                     
                     
                        MOST commonly little Children, when they are newly borne, are ſubiect to diuers diſeaſes, which chaunce in their eies, eares, noſe, mouth Nauell, and other parts of their bodies, as we will ſhew heereafter in briefe.
                     
                        Of the diſeaſes of the eies.Concerning thoſe that happen in their eies; I referre the young Chirurgion to my booke of the diſeaſes of the eies, which I wrote on that ſubiect. But becauſe, that for the moſt part they are troubled with watering, and bloud-ſhot eies, it will not bee amiſſe in this caſe, that the Nurſe ſprinkle him ſome of her milke, to make him open his eies, and take away the gumme that holdeth them together. She may likewiſe waſh them with a little roſe water, and Plantaine water warm'd, and ſhall annoint the lids and corners of his eies, morning and euening with a little Vnguentum Tutiae well made &amp; prepared; for this ointment hath power through

his oylines, to keepe the eyelids from ſticking and gluing together, to ſtrengthen them and take away any inflammation that may happen there.
                     Oftentimes the Noſe of little Children is ſo ſtopped with filth and matter which is dryed,Of the noſe. that they can ſcarcely fetch breath thereby. This accident doth much trouble them, eſpecially when they ſucke, and it makes them oftentimes ſwallow their ſpittle, and breath with paine: when this chanceth, the Nurſe muſt moiſten the inſide of the noſe, with fine ſoft linnen tents, rubd ouer with ſome Vnguentum Roſatum, or Pomatum, or for want of theſe, ſhe ſhall take a little of the ſeething of the pot, and make him ſnift it vp into his noſe (if he haue diſcretion to do it.)
                     Likewiſe the eares of little children do commonly runne as well within as without,Of the eares. which happeneth becauſe naturally their braine is very moiſt, and beſides there ariſe many vapors from the entrailes into the head, which fills their braine with moiſture, and that runne and flows by the eares: and therefore the Nurſe muſt haue a care to keepe cleane the childs eares, as well within as without, and behind them: dropping into them gently now and then, two or three drops of oile of bitter Almonds, with a little Honey of Roſes, a little warm'd. And if there be any fretting or excoriation behind and about the eares: then the nurſe ſhal lay on them handſomely, fine linnen plaſters, handſomely, fine little plaſters, made with an ointment compoſed of white waxe, and oyle of Nuts.
                     
                        Towards the hinder part of the eares, about the bottome of them, there happens oftentimes ſwellings which the Ancients call Parotides, and the French Orillons: when theſe happen, they muſt bee rub'd with oyle of ſweet Almonds, laying vppon it a little quilt made of carden cotten, or fatty wooll baſted betweene fine linnen clothes.
                     And the better to reſolue the ſaid ſwelling you may adde to it a little oyle of Chamomile, and Lillies. If theſe ſwellings come to ſuppuration, they muſt be dreſſed as other impoſtumes be, not vſing thereto any repercuſſiue medicines.
                  
                  
                     Of the ſoares and vlcers, which happen in the childs mouth, called Aphthae. CHAP. XVI.
                     
                     
                        MOſt commonly in the mouths of children, there ariſe little puſtules and vlcers which poſſeſſe not only the ſides of the mouth, the tongue, and the gums, but euen the very almonds, &amp; pallet, of the mouth, and they were called of the Ancients Aphthae. Of theſe vlcers there bee ſome that are malignant and creeping,
                           Aphthae, or the vlcers of the mouth.
                         which ſpread abroad as the Herpes doth: and according to the malignity of the humor, which breeds them, they are eyther the eaſier, or harder to be cured: thoſe which come of ſome ſalt flegme, &amp; which are neither deepe, nor painfull, nor of an ill colour, nor placed at the bottome of the throat.

But are onely about the gums, the tongue, and the ſides of the mouth, which neyther grow bigger, nor ſpread farther, they are eaſie to be healed. But thoſe which creep farther, &amp; are very painful, blackiſh, and which poſſeſſe the bottome of the throat, hauing an Ague ioyned with them, they (as Hippocrates ſaith) are malignant, and hard to be cured. I haue ſeene ſome, that for all the care and diligence that could be vſed to them, haue fallen into a Gangrene. Which hath happened to diuers and of late, to a Cutlers child, who was looked vnto by Monſ. Habigot a Maſter Barber Chirurgion of Paris, although hee had ſought and vſed all the meanes, both skilfully and faithfully, that Art could require.
                     For the helping of them that are curable, it is fit, that the Nurſe keepe a good dyet, let the vlcers be gently rubbed a little with Hony of Roſes, and ſyrup of Violets: But if they will not yeeld to this, then the Chirurgion ſhall touch them with a little Aqua fortis, but to euery drop of the ſaid water, he muſt adde twelue of Plantaine water, according as he would haue it to be in ſtrength:A Gargariſm for the vlcers of the mouth. then with a little clout tyed to the end of a ſticke, the vlcers ſhall be touched gently. They may alſo vſe this Gargariſme.

                     And this medicine did neuer deceiue mee: but the Chirurgion ought to taſt it firſt with his tongue to ſee that it be neither too ſtrong nor too ſharpe.
                  
                  
                     Of the Inflammation, ſwelling, and ſuperfluous fleſh, which happens in the Gums called Paroulis, and Epoules. CHAP. XVII.
                     
                     
                        IT is ſeene oftentimes, that the gummes of little Children are ſwolne, and inflammed, though their teeth bee not ready to come foorth: which accident the Ancients called Paroulis and Epoulis.
                     
                     The Paroulis, is a little ſwelling red and angry, which is either bred of a cholericke, hot, and aduſt bloud; or elſe of ſome ſharp and ſalt flegme, which falleth out of the brain vpon the gums. It may proceede alſo, from ſome vapor, that riſeth out of the ſtomacke; which cauſeth not onely the gums to

be ſwolne and inflammed, but oftentimes the iaw, the cheeke and the necke, to be alſo affected with it, bringing alſo with it an Ague and paine:The Cure. which is the occaſion that theſe tumors doe often ſuppurate: and chiefly when there is any groſſe bloud mingled therewithall, otherwiſe it will reſolue and be digeſted well enough.
                     For the Cure of it you muſt vſe at the beginning gentle Lotions, and Gargariſmes,A Gargariſm. that are cooling and not much repelling, adding thereto towards the end, ſome things that may reſolue. You may vſe this Gargariſme.

                     Herewith ſhall you cauſe the child to waſh and Gargariſe his mouth, if he be able: if not, then you muſt often rub his gummes therewith. Or elſe you ſhall annoint his gummes with the Mucilage of Psyllium and Quince ſeeds,A medicine for the necke and iawes. drawne with Roſe and Plantaine water, adding thereto a little ſyrup of Iuiubes.
                     
                     If the iaw bone, cheekes, and necke be inflamed, the Ancients counſaile vs to rub them with a little oyle of Roſes warmed, adding thereto ſome iuice of Nightſhade, Meſues Ointment of Roſes is alſo very good for it.
                     If the child bee any thing big, let him take this drinke.

                     If the tumor cannot bee reſolued, but rather grows to ſuppuration, then you ſhall make him a Gargariſme with Figs, Raiſings, Iuiubes, Licoriſe, and french barley, well boyled. Let him hold in his mouth a little warm milke: and ſometimes lay halfe a fat figge hot to the gummes.
                     When it is come to ſuppuration, the tumor ſhal be lanced, yet ſometimes it breakes of it ſelfe; then let it be mundified with Mil Roſatum, ſyrup of dry Roſes, or Cherries, or the like.
                     As for the Epoulis, it is a little excreſcence of fleſh, riſing like a bliſter vpon the gums, and moſt commonly betwixt the teeth, but chiefly among the hindermoſt, ſometimes it is painfull and cauſeth an Ague. The cauſe therof, is almoſt the ſame as we haue ſaid of the Paroulis.
                     
                     For the cure, at the beginning, you muſt vſe ſome ſuch Gargariſme as followeth, becauſe it is needfull to vſe more aſtringent medicines in this, then in the Paroulis.

                     Of the two ſtrings or ligaments that a child hath vnder his tongue. CHAP. XVIII.
                     
                     
                        IN Children that are newly borne there are commonlie found two ſtrings: the one comes from the bottome of the tongue, and reacheth to the very tip and end therof. This ſtring is very ſlender and ſoft, and it hindreth the childe from putting it out at length, and from taking the nipple (as they ſay) that he cannot ſucke well. This ſtring muſt be cut with a ſizzer within a few daies after he is borne: and then the nurſe muſt thruſt her finger vnder the childs tongue, and lay there at the firſt a little chaw'd ſalt to keepe it from growing together againe.
                     There is alſo another ſtring, which is both harder bigger, and more firme, then the former: which

begins at the root of the tongue, and ſtretcheth it ſelfe almoſt through the middle thereof, the which ſtring is oftentimes ſo ſhort, that it hinders the child from ſtretching it, and putting it foorth of his mouth, and alſo from turning and wagging it, therby to bring backe the meat hee hath chaw'd, that hee may ſwallow it. This may eaſily be perceiued, for if you bid the childe to put out his tongue hee cannot doe it; for when he goes about to doe it, it binds and folds double in his mouth, hee not being able to make it come farther then his lips: which much hindereth him in his ſpeech, and in the deliuery of his words, making him commonly to ſtammer.
                     
                        How to cut the ſtring of the tongue.The cure of this is onely to bee done by the Chirurgian, and that after two manners: the firſt is thus: you muſt cauſe the childes tongue to bee lifted vp, and held ſtiffe on both ſides, as well by your owne finger, as by ſome others, which ſhall hold the other ſide of the tongue, to keepe it ſtiffe, and then let the ſtring be cut with a ſharpe inſtrument, thruſting in the point, as deepe as ſhall be fit.
                     
                        Another wayThe ſecond way alſo is, by lifting vp the tongue, and holding it faſt, (as hath beene already ſaide) and then with a needle with a double thred in it, you ſhall draw the thred croſſe the ſaid ſtring, or ligament (to wit, as farre as you would cut it) and tye it hard, cutting away the ends of the thred ſomwhat neere the knot, and ſo let it ſtay there till it hath ſeparated that part of the ſtring or ligament

thus tyed. But this way in my opinion, is more painfull then the former. But whether it be cut or tyed, it will leaue an vlcer which muſt be healed, as wee haue ſhewed before, taking care that the ſtring grow not together againe.
                  
                  
                     Of the Cough which happeneth to little Children. CHAP. XIX.
                     
                     
                        WE ſee, that little Children are often troubled with a Cough: which happens vnto them, becauſe their lungs are weake and tender, which for euery little thing that troubleth them, they endeuour to diſcharge and rid themſelues of it, with ſome ſtriuing agitation.
                     They may alſo catch this diſeaſe by lying vncouered,The cauſes of the cough. or by being carried abroad in the cold, or in the euening; which makes them to cough, bringing vp little or nothing. They may alſo cough with ſucking too eagerly, drawing the milke faſter then they can ſwallow it: and ſo ſome few drops by chance get into the Trachaea Arteria, which makes them neuer leaue coughing till they haue brought it all vp againe.
                     The cough may likewiſe proceede from the diſtillation of ſome ſharpe, thin humor, which commeth from the braine, and falleth downe vpon the lungs by the Trachea Arteria. There may alſo bee

gathered, ſome humor in the Pipes or Paſſages of the lungs, which Nature at length ſtriueth to expell and thruſt foorth.
                     
                        The cough is dangerous for children.Of what occaſion ſoeuer it proceede, it is very dangerous, eſpecially, if it be of long continuance. For feare leaſt through continuall reaching and coughing, the child get a rupture, or burſting, or elſe an Ague, by reaſon hee cannot ſleepe nor take his reſt, onely ſome headach, paine of the ſides and ſtomacke, and vomiting.
                     Concerning the cure of it, we muſt haue a reſpect to the cauſe, &amp; ſo accordingly it muſt be remedied.
                     If the Cough proceed of Cold, let the little one bee kept reaſonable warme,Medicines againſt the Cough. and giue him a little oyle of ſweet Almonds mingled with ſuger Candy: let his breaſt be rub'd all ouer with freſh butter and oyle of ſweet Almonds: and then lay vpon it ſome warme cloth: if his noſe be ſtuffed, let it be vnſtopped, with a little ointment of Roſes, or ſome of the liquor you boyle your meate in, whereof you may put a little vp into his noſe for that purpoſe.
                     If it proceed of ſome ſharpe humor: then it muſt be mitigated and thickned, by giuing him a little ſyrup of Violets, and of Iuiubes mingled together. As alſo let him vſe Iuice of Licoriſe, Oile of ſweete Almonds and ſuger Candy; and Lozenges of Diatragacant hum frigidum. If the childe bee any thing big, you may giue Barley Cream, with a few white Poppy ſeeds: and let him drink a Ptiſane made with Barley, and Licoriſe.
                     Let all his breſt and throat bee annointed with

Oile of Violets waſhed in Barley water.
                     Apply to the nape of his necke a toſt of bread hot, or elſe halfe a loafe new out of the ouen.Means to ſtay the cough.
                     
                     If the Cough hinders him from ſleeping, you may giue him a little Sirup of Iuiubes, and Violets, with aſmuch Diacodium ſine ſpeciebus, mingled altogether: Let him alſo vſe Conſerue of Roſes.
                     If the Cough come by reaſon of ſome fleagme, or groſſe and ſlimie humour, that is gather'd together in the breaſt: You muſt giue the child a little Sirup of Maidenhaire, with as much Sirup or Licoriſe, and Hyſſope, or Hony of Narbone, mingled together: Raſis addeth in this caſe a little Fennell water.
                     Annoint his breaſt alſo with this Ointment.

                        OFtentimes,The cauſe of the ſwelling of the nauell.after the childs Nauell is tyed, there commeth ſome inflammation, ſwelling, or vlcer, and eſpecially this hapneth when that which hath

been tyed is diuided and fallen away, it being not perfectly ſuppurated. The ſame Nauell may ſwell alſo either through the childes eager crying, or when he coughes much, the tumor and ſwelling being full of wind, and ſometimes alſo of water.
                     
                        The Cure.The inflammation may be cur'd by the vſe of Vnguentum Roſatum, or with a little Vnguentum Refrigerans Galeni: The bathing it alſo with Oile of Roſes, and a little Vnguentum Populeon, may do verie much good.
                     As for the Vlcer, if it be but ſmall, you may put vpon it ſome fine Flower, or the powder of a rotten poſt, or elſe a little plaſter of Diapompholigos, and Vnguentum deſiccatiuum, mingled together: You may alſo ſometimes touch it with a little Allome water, and ſo cicatrize it.
                     As for the ſwelling, you muſt haue a care that the Nauell ſtand not foorth too far, and ſwell not more then it ought. Now to hinder that, you ſhall lay vpon it, a cloth eight or ten times doubled, and then ſwath it gently, that the ſaid Nauell ſtand not foorth too much: which ought to be done, if there be neither wind nor water contained within it. But when either of them are there, Auicen vſeth this medicine.

                     Of Gripings and Fretting in the belly, which troubleth little Children. CHAP. XXI.
                     
                     
                        THeſe gripings do trouble little children verie much; the cauſes are two: For either they come becauſe the excrement called Meconium, is retained in the guts: (This humour is black and ſlimy like melted pitch, which pricketh and wringeth their guts, and puts them to paine, to void it) Or elſe theſe Gripings are bred of the abundance of milke, which the child taketh, or of the ill qualitie thereof: the which being not digeſted, doth putrifie and corrupt, and turnes either into choller, or into ſharpe and ſalt fleagme: Or elſe there is bred ſome wind, which cauſeth a diſtention of the ſtomacke and guts. The cold aire, and the wormes alſo may cauſe it, which I leaue to be handled in another place.
                     
                        
                        The Cure.Concerning the cure, if the ſaid excrement, called Meconium, be the cauſe of the ſaid gripings, it muſt be euacuated by little ſuppoſitaries made of the rib of a Beete leafe, or of Sope; and alſo by Clyſters, to draw away this humour, and make it come foorth.
                     If too much milke be the cauſe: then the Nurſe ſhall not giue the child ſucke ſo often, nor in ſuch plentie: If it proceed from wind, and that do cauſe the child to be thus troubled, it ſhall be diſcuſſed with Fomentations applied to the belly and Nauell; and with Carminatiue Cliſters, which ſhall be giuen him, as this:

                     Of the foreſaid decoction you may alſo make a fomentation, with fine ſpunges: and then let his bellie be rub'd and annointed with oyle of Camomile, Melilot and Dill, mingled together.
                     
                        Parietary of the wall, with a few Camomile flowers, and tops of Dill, fryed with Oile of Lillies, and Dill, and then layd to the belly hot, are very good.
                     If you perceiue, that theſe gripings proceed of ſome ſharpe, biting, or chollericke humor, that gnaws and gripes the ſtomack, and the guts (which may be knowne, both by feeling his belly, which

will be hotter then ordinary, and alſo by the ſtooles which will be yellow and greeniſh) then ſhall you giue him little Cliſters of milke, or elſe of the broth of Veale, Capon, or of a ſheeps head, wherein you ſhall diſſolue two drams of Benedicta Lanatiua, and as much Oyle of Violets, and red ſuger.
                     Let his belly be rubbed with Oyle of Roſes and Violets, or elſe with Meſues Ointment of Roſes.
                     You may giue him to take inwardly ſome Oyle of ſweet Almonds newly drawne and mingled with Suger candy.
                     And if the child be any thing big, it will be very fit to giue him an ounce of the compound ſirup of Cichory with Rubarbe diſſolued into Agrimony water, or of Carduus Benedictus, you may alſo mingle amongſt his pappe or gruell, a little Caſsia drawne, the better to make him take it.
                  
                  
                     Of the Wormes. CHAP. XXII.
                     
                     
                        THe Wormes doe trouble little children very cruelly, and therefore not without good reaſon did Hippocrates call them Theriodigaſtros;
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . as cruell beaſts in the belly. There be of them of diuers formes, and bignes.
                     Some of them are round and long,
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . named Elminthes, which breed in the ſmall guts, they aſcend ſomtimes into the ſtomacke, and come foorth at

the mouth. There be others that are long and flat, called Teniae,
                        
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . which are as it were a band couched, and placed all along the great guts. Some are little and ſlender as the point of a needle,
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . and are called Ascarides, by reaſon of the itching which they cauſe in the great gut, &amp; the fundament, in which place they are bred: and oftentimes they are incloſed, as it were with a little purſe. I haue ſeene diuers, that haue voided a million, which haue bene, al of them faſtned together.
                     Touching their generation, Hippocrates obſerueth that little children doe bring the wormes euen from their Mothers belly, but moſt commonly they are bred of putride &amp; corrupted flegm, as alſo of other ill humors, which lye in the guts.
                     When children are troubled with the wormes, they waxe leane, they haue no deſire to eate, their belly aketh, ſwels, and grows bigger; they ſtart in their ſleepe, and doe ſometimes ſwoune, and haue a little drye Cough: the colour of their face is pale and wanne, and their eies great: they rub their noſe commonly: and when they are troubled with ſmall wormes, their fundament itcheth: But the ſureſt ſigne that a child hath the wormes of what nature ſoeuer they be: is when hee voides them with his excrements by ſtoole, or that they come vp by the mouth, or through the noſe, which I haue oftentimes ſeene come to paſſe.
                     Concerning the Prognoſticke, as ſoone as you perceiue that the little one is troubled, you muſt ſeeke to help him; for the deferring of it may breed

danger. The Ancients haue written that there are ſome, which haue come foorth through the groyn, and nether belly: which is witneſſed by Paulas Aegineta, and Auicen.
                     
                     The Wormes that come foorth by ſtoole, mingled with bloud, ſhew that they haue gnawne the veines of the guts from whence that bloud floweth. If they are brought vp by vomiting, it ſhewes that they prouoke and trouble the ſtomacke.
                     Some haue obſerued, that a child which hath the Wormes, is in danger of death, if he bee taken with a ſhortneſſe of breath, and becomes moiſt, and cold.
                     For the Cure, if the child be young,The Cure. it will bee very conuenient, that the Nurſe keepe, a good dyet: let her abſteine from all white meates, raw fruits, Peaſe, beanes, Fiſh, and all other meates that are of hard concoction, and eaſie to bee corrupted.

                     You may alſo giue the child, if hee bee ſomwhat

big, a little of the ſcrapings of Harts horne, in his milke or other ſpoonemeate. Thoſe that are rich doe commonly giue their children ſome Bezoards ſtone, and Vnicornes horne.
                     But when the child is grown ſomwhat older, beſides the former medicines, let him take a little drinke made with decoction of Purcelaine, and the ſhauings of Harts horne, with a little iuice of Citrons: If hee can, let him take a little expreſſion of Rubarbe, infuſed in the foreſaid decoction: or elſe an ounce of ſirup of Cichory. For it killeth and driueth foorth the wormes downeward. But it will be good to giue him firſt a Cliſter of milke, red ſuger, and hony, to draw downe the worms by this ſweetnes, to the nether parts.
                     There is no medicine, that will doe more good if the child can take it, then to take little pils made of Aloes gilded, in an egge, and ſo ſup them vp.
                     If he refuſe theſe medicines aforeſaid, then you may giue him ſome of the powder for the wormes, in a roſted Apple, or with Prunes or Raiſins. The ſafeſt way is, rather to driue them foorth, then to kill them: for oftentimes they breed others, when they ſtay in the body.
                  
                  
                     Of breeding of teeth. CHAP. XXIII.
                     
                     
                        
                           Hippoc. lib. 3. Aphoriſ. 25.
                        HIppocrates writeth that amongſt all the diſeaſes, which children are ſubiect vnto, there is none that troubleth them more, then the comming foorth and

paine of their teeth. For the breeding of teeth,The ill accidents which breeding of the teeth brings to children. bringeth diuers dangerous accidents, with it, as Agues, Watchings, Convulſions, ſcouring, yea, and oftentimes death: From whence commeth the prouerbe, C'eſt vn bel enfant iuſque aux dents. It is a goodly child, if his teeth prooue milde. And therfore, not without cauſe did Galen ſay in his Commentary, that the paine of a childs teeth comming foorth, was more grieuous and hard to be endured, then the paine of a needle thruſt in any part of the fleſh, which continues no longer then the needle ſtayes there: but in the comming foorth of the teeth, it is not ſo, becauſe then the gums do pricke and ſhout continually, which for the moſt part are much inflamed; and this pricking and ſhooting ſtill increaſeth, till the teeth be quite come foorth.
                     Now yee may know whether the childe breeds teeth, by the heate of his mouth, which makes him driuell, and ſlauer, and his gums will be ſwollen, he holds his finger ſtill in his mouth, by reaſon of the itching of his gummes, which increaſing more and more, puts him to extreame paine, and makes the bloud ready to ſtartle out of his eies.
                     
                        Hippocrates in his booke de Dentitione,
                        
                           Aelius. ſem. 4. cap. 9. giues this iudgement of it. They that doe ſcoure, when they breed teeth, are not ſo ſubiect to Convulſions, as they that are bound.
                     If they be taken with a ſharpe ague, they are the leſſe troubled with Convulſions.
                     Thoſe that are in good health when their teeth come forth; if they be very drowſy and ſleepy, there

is danger leaſt they fall into a Convulſion.
                     They that breed teeth in Winter, are leſſe troubled, then thoſe in Sommer: and if they bee a little helped, they will endure it the eaſier.
                     All that are troubled with Convulſions at the comming foorth of their teeth, do not die, but many eſcape.
                     Their teeth come foorth hardeſt, that haue a little cough with all: and if they bee troubled with pricking and ſhooting of the gums, they become very leane.
                     Conſidering all the former accidents, and alſo the danger wherin the child is, there muſt be ſpeedy helpe: which ſhall bee done eyther by ordinary medicines, or elſe by Chirurgery.
                     
                        The Cure. Firſt therefore, the Nurſe muſt often rub the childs gums with her finger alone, thereby to open the pores of them, &amp; make them ſoft, that the moiſture may breath out the better: and ſometimes let her annoint her finger eyther with Hony, freſh butter, the braines of a Hare; or ſuch like (either roſted, or raw) or elſe with oyle of Lillies,An experimēt or Hens greaſe. Some hold it for a great ſecret to rubbe the childs gums, with the milke of a bitch, eyther of it ſelfe, or mingled with the braines of a pig. Auicen preſcribes that they ſhould hold a ſlice of fat meat betweene their gums,
                           Auicen
                         and chaw it often. And it is to bee noted, that all the foreſaid medicines ought to be applied more then luke warme.
                     The Ancients make mention of ſome medicines which by a hidden property haue vertue to eaſe

this paine, and help to bring foorth the teeth. Some take the tooth of a Male Viper, and ſet it in gold or ſiluer to rubbe the childs gummes with it.
                           Aecius.
                         
                        Aecius bids, that we ſhould hang about the childs necke a Iaſper ſtone, that is very greene, and let it touch the ſtomacke; Auicen ſaith,
                           Auicen.
                         that the roote of ſmallage hung about a childs necke, doth aſſwage and eaſe the paine which happens in the comming foorth of the teeth.
                     Neither will it be amiſſe before the paine grow to be great and vehement, to rub the legs, thighs, ſhoulders, back, and nape of the childs neck drawing ſtill downeward; thereby to alter, and turn the courſe of humors which fal downe vpon the gums, and paſſages of the throat in great quantity, which may ſtifle him.
                     But if none of all theſe medicines doe any good, as oftentimes it happens: then the ſafeſt, and ſpeedieſt way, is to make an inciſion al along the top of the gumme, iuſt vpon the teeth. Which the Chirurgion ſhall know, is fit to be done, when he ſees the gumme grows white, and perceiues that the teeth are euen ready to cut the fleſh. The Nurſes themſelues ſhew vs that this practiſe is very neceſſary and fit; for oftentimes they do ſcratch and tear the gumme with their nailes, which turneth to the childs great profit, and eaſe, and keepes him from lying languiſhing ſo long in paine:An experience of the Author. And I can aſſure the young Chirurgion that I haue practiz'd it, and cauſed it to bee practized with very good ſucceſſe, aboue twenty times.
                     
                        Now when you perceiue that the teeth begin to come foorth, whether it be by the foreſaid Medicines, by the lancing of the gums: Auicen would haue the Nurſe to hold a peece of an Ireos roote, in her hand, and let the childe champe vpon it: or inſteede thereof ſhe may vſe a ſticke of Licoriſe bruiſed at the one end, or elſe a peece of an Althaea root: For this remedy doth aſſwage the paine, becauſe it maketh the moiſture, which is about the childs gums, breaſt, and roote of the tongue, to come away, and cauſe the reſt of the teeth, to come forward. And therefore they doe vſe commonly for this purpoſe, to hang about the childs necke either a wolfes tooth, or a branch of red Corall ſet in ſiluer, for the child to hold in his hand, and to rub his gums with it.

                        IT is not my intent in this place to handle particularly all the kinds and differences of Convulſions, but onely I will content my ſelfe to ſpeak of that which commonly troubleth little children,
                           Hip. de Aero loc. &amp; Aquis. Morbus puerilis. Mater puerorū.
                         and is called by Hippocrates Morbus Puerilis, the childs diſeaſe, and by Auicen Mater Puerorum, the mother of little children.
                     
                        Hippocrates calleth this diſeaſe Sacer, and therefore

it is eaſie to be coniectured, that it is an Epilepticall Convulſion.
                     
                     The cauſe proceedeth, (as Auicen ſaith) either becauſe that the milke (wherewith the chid is nouriſhed) is eaſily corrupted; though hee ſucke but little: or by reaſon of the great quantity, that the child taketh, which becauſe of his weake and dainty ſtomacke cannot be well concocted, and digeſted: or through the il quality of the milk which the child ſucks daily; or through the weaknes of the ſinews, which do receiue eaſily the moiſture that is bred in the childs body, whereof Nature doth vnburthen her ſelfe, vpon them, which happeneth chiefly,An Aphoriſm of Hippocrates.
                         (as Hippocrates ſaith) to children that are fat, and haue full bodies, and are bound in their bellies.
                     This Convulſion oftentimes chanceth through the childs breeding of teeth,Diuers cauſes of a Convulſion. and eſpecially of his dog teeth, by meanes of the paine, inflammation, feuers, and watchings, which do commonly follow vpon it.
                     The cold aire alſo may be a cauſe, and likewiſe the Wormes, which the child may haue, or ſome ill vapor that ſtriketh vp, and offends the braine: which may ariſe out of the ſtomacke by reaſon of ſome putrifaction; or elſe from that which is bred by meanes of the wormes.
                     As for the Prognoſticke hereof, Hippocrates ſaith,The Prognoſticke. Hippo. de morbe Sacro.
                         that the Children, which haue cleane heads, are ſubiect to Convulſions: And contrariwiſe that thoſe which haue ſcabs on their head and breake

forth are commonly in good health: For by them, they are purged &amp; clenſed of all the ill humors, that they had gathered in their mothers wombe.Good ſentences of the Ancients. 
                        Galen ſaith, that the danger is eaſily perceiued, by the childs ſhortnes of breath: Auicen &amp; Paulus Aegineta doe aſſure vs, that the continuance of this diſeaſe long, doth oftentimes kill the child. Areteus ſaith, that one violent fit only, is enough to kill him: they that are younger, are in greater danger of death, then the elder, as Caelius Aurelius writeth, becauſe they cannot ſo eaſily beare out the fits, as the elder.
                     Therefore we muſt take great heede in the cure of it,The Cure. not thinking that this diſeaſe may bee helped by the childs growing older.
                     The Cure muſt be varied according to the cauſe of the diſeaſe. As if it proceed of repletion, and fulneſſe of humors, then muſt the Nurſe eat leſſe, and not giue the child ſucke ſo often: in both which ſhe muſt obſerue a meane: and therfore the Nurſe ſhall rather vſe meates, that are ſomwhat drying: then ſuch as are too moiſt: And not without good reaſon doth Auicen allow the vſe of Wine well tempeted, rather then Water alone.
                     If the little one haue neede to be purged, it will bee fitter to giue the Nurſe a purgation then the child: which muſt neither be very ſtrong, nor with any Diagridium,
                        Vomiting good for the child. but gentle and eaſie, ſuch as Caſsia, Manna, and the like.
                     If the child be ſubiect to vomit, eſpecially if he be very big,Cupping glaſſes. the vomiting may do him much good.
                     When he comes to be 2. or 3. yeres old, you may

apply cupping glaſſes, vpon his neck and ſhoulders: which is much commended by Auicen, thereby to draw the moiſture of the braine to the lower parts.
                     And concerning particular medicines, they muſt not be too hot (as ſome appoint) for the affections of the Nerues, becauſe thoſe heate too much: and (as Rhaſis ſaith) they doe onely reſolue the thinner part. But we muſt rather vſe in the beginning ſuch as mollifye and ſoften, and do moderately reſolue, comforting withall.
                     Among many other medicines, Dioſcorides ſaith,
                           Dioſcorides.
                         that Oleum Irinum cureth the convulſion, which troubleth little children: and it is likewiſe commended by the ancient Practicioners: This Oile is deſcribed by Meſue.
                     
                     
                        Auicen approueth Oleum Irinum, Keyrinum, and Liliorum: He ſaith moreouer, that he hath made triall of this medicine.

                        The ancient Practicioners do verie much commend the Balme made of a Gooſe ſtuffed with the foreſaid ingredients,
                           Balſamum Anſerin

                        Galen doth attribute much to the hanging of a little chaplet, made of the male Piony roote, about the childs necke.
                     
                        Oribaſius much commendeth the Smaradge or Emerauld, that lookes greeniſh, which is found either in the ſtomacke, or neaſt of a Swallow.
                     But the ſafeſt medicine of all is, to lay a Cauterie to the hinder part of the childs head,A ſoueraigne medicine. in the nape of the necke, betweene the firſt and ſecond Vertebra, or ioint: which I haue done to ſome. And at Florence it is practiz'd to all children, as ſoone as they are borne: yea, they do it, euen with an actuall Cauterie.
                     If you perceiue that theſe Epilepticall convulſions doe proceed from the Wormes in the childs guts; then you may giue him this Clyſter.

                     You may giue a child, that is ſomewhat big, as of eight or ten moneths old, a dredge powder made of Worme ſeed, or of Rubarbe.
                     
                        Beſides, there be many other medicines, which I haue already ſet downe in their proper place, as Emplaſters, Sirups, and Purgations for this diſeaſe, to which place I refer you.
                     If theſe convulſions come of ſome ill and maligne vapour, the child may take ſome Bezoards ſtone, and Vnicornes horne, three or foure graines at a time of them both, or either of them with a little Purcelane water: or elſe you may mingle fiue or ſixe graines of Triacle, or Mithridat, with the ſaid water, and ſo giue it him.
                     Let the Nurſe vſe to take ſome of this Opiate, verie often: which the child alſo may do, when he is growne ſomewhat big.

                     ANd not without good cauſe doth Hippocrates ſay,
                           Hippoc. lib. 3. Aphoriſmor.
                         that too much watching in a

child, is a diſeaſe: becauſe ſleep is naturally proper to a child. And when it fals out that he cannot ſleep, there muſt needs be ſomewhat that troubles and offends him.
                     
                        Whereby a child may be hindred from ſleeping.A child may be hindred from ſleeping, by lying in a chamber that is either too light, too hote, or full of ſmoake: or elſe becauſe the clothes lie too heauie on him: or becauſe of much noiſe, or paine, as it happens to them, when they breed Teeth, as likewiſe by hauing a pin that prickes them: or elſe becauſe they are not cleane. Beſides, the child may be hindred from ſleeping through the ouermuch quantitie of milke, that he hath ſucked, as alſo though it be taken in ſmall quantitie, if it chance to corrupt; becauſe (as Auicen ſaith) by meanes of this putrifaction, there is commonly bred wind and vapours in the braine.
                     
                        Signes that the child is amiſſe.The ſignes hereof are euident enough; as when the child crieth continually, and cannot be ſtill'd or quieted at all by the teat. Then (as Gordonius ſaith) their ey-browes ſeeme ſwolne, and ſometimes their countenance becomes verie wan and pale: which comes ſo to paſſe (as Auicen ſaith) through the diſſipation of the ſpirits, and becauſe the braine is fill'd full of vapours and exhalations.
                     
                        The Cure.Concerning the Cure, we muſt take away the cauſe that nouriſheth this watching: if it be by lying in a place that is too light, and open to the aire, then muſt the windowes be ſhut, making it darker: if the chamber where he lyeth be too hote, or if the child haue too many clothes on him, then

muſt he be laid cooler, and haue fewer clothes, and be without any noiſe.
                     If breeding of Teeth be the cauſe, then ſhall it be help'd, as hath been already ſaid.
                     Beſides, the child ſhall be vnſwath'd,Diuers means to make a child ſleep. and laid in cleane clouts, and then the Nurſe ſhall looke whether there be any pin, or fold of his clothes, or any other thing that hurts him: She muſt neither giue him ſucke ſo often, nor in ſo great quantitie: and to helpe to void the corruption that may be in his ſtomacke, it will be good to giue the child ſome little Clyſter, or gentle purgation. Likewiſe the Nurſe muſt rocke and ſing to him: and if you find, that he cannot take any reſt, by all theſe meanes; then may you giue him a little Barley water, or Barley creame, with a few white Poppie ſeeds in it: or elſe you may let him take a ſpoonfull of Syrup of Violets and Diacodium mingled together: But you muſt abſtaine by all meanes from giuing him any Narcoticall or ſtupifying medicines, according to the opinion of all Practicioners. Rhaſis bids vs annoint the inſide of the childs noſe, with Oile of Violets, and iuice of Lettuce, putting thereto alſo a little iuice of Henbane, and yet he goes farther, for he addeth ſome Opium to it. But herein we muſt be verie warie and circumſpect, and rather forbeare the vſe of it.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of the affrightings, ſtartings, and raging, which happens to young Children. CHAP. XXVI.
                     
                     
                        ALl children are naturally very greedy, and gluttenous, and therefore many times, and eſpecially when they grow ſomwhat big, and are wained, they doe fill them ſelues with much milke, or with ſtore of diuers other victuals. Beſide, they are ſubiect to breed wormes, which dying, abide ſtill in their guts, by reaſon of which there grows much corruption both in the ſtomack and guts, and alſo in the meſenterie, and this corruption growing hot by the heat and moiſture of the child, it ſends vp vapors to the brain, from the aforeſaid parts, which mingling themſelues with the ſpirits, which are there placed, doe cauſe dreames, frights and ſtartings in the ſleepe, and (as Auicen witneſſeth) makes children afraide of things which are not at all to be feared.
                     
                        
                           Gal. in Hip. lib. 3. Aphoriſ. 24.
                        
                        Galen teacheth vs, that this feare happens then when the ſtomacke of the child is weake, and the meate which he taketh corrupts in it: which cauſeth vapors, and fumes to riſe to the head, and ſo bring theſe terrors.
                     This may alſo happen to thoſe which are more in yeares, by the vſe of bad meates: eſpecially if the mouth of the ſtomacke be weake and feeble. And

therefore Auicen ſaith, that bad concoction, makes bad dreames.
                     As for the ſignes that belong heere-unto,The ſignes to know whether a childe be frighted in his ſleepe. there can none be obſerued in children that can not ſpeak but onely (as Pliny ſaith) that as ſoone as they bee awake, they wil ſcreech and cry out, as if they were out of their wits, and vtterlye caſt away: and commonly you ſhall finde them all of a water, and quaking euery part of them: And if you aske them, why they cry, they which can ſpeake will ſay, that they were made afraide, and that they ſaw ſome thing in their ſleepe. Moreouer they that are thus frighted are much giuen to vomiting, they are pale of countenance and ſomtimes very red: and alſo they doe hide their faces, and if anyone come neare them they cry out, and are afraid of him.
                     Thus may we eaſily obſerue that ſuch dreames, and frights happen not to young children, but when they bee ill at eaſe, and full of bad humors.

                              r. anim. lib. 4. cap. 10. And this is witneſſed by Ariſtotle, who ſaith; that young infants are not ſubiect to dreames: experience teaching vs, that thoſe who as yet haue not diſcretion to know good from bad, are not feared with terrible and fearefull ſights, but contrariwiſe, doe laugh at them, and are well pleaſed.
                     For the Cure of this accident,The Cure. both the Nurſe and alſo the child (when he comes to eate) muſt auoide all meates, which do corrupt the ſtomacke, and ſuch as are apt to breede groſſe and malignant vapors, ſuch as Peaſe, Beanes, Leekes, Onions, Coleworts, which (as Dioſcorides reporteth) doe

procure ſadde and Melancholike dreames.
                     
                        The diet, that the Nurſe, &amp; the child muſt keepe.Let them feede vpon good meates, and in a moderate quantity, that ſo the ſtomacke may not bee ouercharged, and that the concoction may bee the more eaſie. Rhaſis wiſheth the Nurſe to drink a cup of good wine.
                     After that the child hath ſucked, and the Nurſe hath eaten, they muſt not (according to the precept of Auicen) go to ſleepe preſently,They muſt not ſleepe preſently after meate. becauſe the meate can not deſcend ſo ſoone to the bottome of the ſtomacke, there to bee embraced and perfectly concocted: And when part thereof ſtayes at the vpper Orifice of the ſtomacke, then the fumes and vapours thereof doe eaſily riſe, and aſcend to the braine.
                     If there be any bad humors abiding within the ſtomacke,Medicines for the child. guts, or meſentery, let them be purged out. Auicen giueth to the child a little hony faſting. If hee bee ſomwhat big, you may giue him a little Caſsia, a ſpoonefull of ſirup of Cichory, and ſirup of Damaske roſes, or ſome Manna in broth.
                     If his ſtomacke be weake, let it be ſtrengthened with this Liniment.

                     But eſpecially let the Nurſe, and thoſe that come about the child, embolden him: taking heede that they put him not in feare of any thing, by ſhewing him any picture or beaſt, or other thing, which may breed any feare, or terror.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of the rupture, or falling downe of the gut, in young Children. CHAP. XXVII.
                     
                     
                        CHildren, and chiefly male-Children are much troubled at this day with the rupture, of which though there be many kinds,The diuers kinds of ruptures. yet will I treat at this preſent onely of the falling downe of the gut, and caule, and of the watery and windie rupture: for thoſe which are called Camoſa and Varicoſa doe ſeldome or neuer happen to young children. I haue obſerued, that many children are born with theſe ruptures, which happen becauſe the child beeing in the Mothers wombe, doth often ſtriue in turning and winding himſelfe, or elſe doth ſo ſtraine himſelfe, that the guts and caule do beare downe vppon the production of the Peritonaeum: which beeing inlarged giueth occaſion of a rupture.
                     As for thoſe which are called Hydrocele, and Phyſocele, which is the watery and windy rupture, it cannot be denied, but that the child before hee be borne (if he draw bad humors from the mother, breedes theſe waters and winds, which may flow downe into the purſes of the cod.
                     Neuertheleſſe,The cauſes of ruptures. moſt commonly theſe kindes of ruptures are bred after the child is borne and come into the World: which happens vpon diuers occaſions,

either becauſe the child hath cryed much, or through a long Cough, or by filling himſelfe too full of milke, or victualls; or by leaping, ſtretching, or ſtraining himſelfe too much going to ride aſtride vpon ſomthing.
                     As for the watry and windy ruptures, they proceede for the moſt part of the bad nouriſhment, which the child takes either of his Nurſe, or elſe of himſelfe after he is wained: whereupon grows infinite Crudities and Winds, which ſteale by the production of the Peritonaeum into the cods.
                     
                        The Cure.For the cure of the falling downe of the gut, if the child bee very young, keepe him quiet, and ſtill him from crying, and if he eate pap, put into it this powder.

                     After that you haue vſed this fomentation a

quarter of an houre, dry the part, and then lay vpon it this plaſter following.

                     Let this Emplaſter be laid vpon the part, and vpon that a little bolſter, to keep all faſt together, that nothing ſlip of: you ſhall bind it on, or elſe vſe a truſſe; but it will be fitter for the child to haue it bound on, and then to be ſwathed vp.
                     This fomentation and plaſter muſt be vſed for the ſpace of thirtie or fortie daies:Reſt neceſſary for the child. and if the child be ſomewhat big, let him be kept quiet in his bed for fortie daies together, taking the powder before diſcribed, with broath, or with a little water of Myrtels, or elſe making the ſaid powder into ſmall Lozenges.
                     The fomentations muſt be made for him, as is alreadie deſcribed, wherewith he muſt be bathed halfe an houre euery morning: and then the plaſter laide on, and faſtned with a truſſe, or cloth bound on it.
                     He muſt forſake all windie meats, as Peaſe,The dyes which the child muſt keepe. Beanes, raw fruits, Salades, and white meats: feeding vpon good meats that are roſted, and of them but in ſmall quantitie.
                     Let him drinke a little Red wine,His drinke. mingled with boyled water: if his bellie be bound, giue him a little clyſter, or elſe ſome broaths, with Sene in it.
                     And you muſt remember, that the Fomentation

muſt not be vſed, nor the plaſter laid on, nor the truſſe, or ſwathes applied, before the gut or caule be put vp: if ſo be that they be fallen downe. And eſpecially you muſt haue a care, that his head be laid ſomewhat low,How the child muſt be laid. and his buttockes high, as he lyeth in his bed, that by this meanes nothing may come downe.
                     Concerning the watrie and windie ruptures, the child muſt keep the ſame Diet, as hath been alreadie preſcribed. And as for locall medicines, they muſt be ſuch in both, as haue power to attenuate, drie vp, diſcuſſe, and reſolue the waters and wind which is within the purſe of the cod.
                     For the watrie rupture, I haue often tried this medicine.

                     But when theſe watrie ruptures grow ſo hard, that they cannot be diſſolued by the medicines aforeſaid,

then muſt they be opened: Which I haue practized vpon young Infants; and amongſt others vpon a child of Monſ. de Vilantry, being not aboue two moneths old: and this I did by the counſaile of Mr Hautin, and Mr Duret, the Kings Phyſicions in ordinarie, and Phyſicions of Paris.
                     The maner of making this Inciſion, I haue ſet downe in my booke, Of the practizes of Chirurgerie: to which I refer the Reader, where he may find all the particularities ſet downe.
                  
                  
                     Of the difficultie of making of Water, wherewith young Children are troubled. CHAP. XXVIII.
                     
                     
                        IT happens oftentimes,The cauſe why children can hardlie piſſe. that young Children can not make water, and that vpon diuers occaſions, but chieflie through the fault of vrine, which offends either in quantitie, or qualitie. The ill qualitie of the Vrine is, when it is hote, ſharpe, and pricking, which makes the child afraid to piſſe: becauſe of the paine which they feele when their water comes. The Vrine offends in quantitie, when it is in ſo great abundance, and doth ſo ouer-charge the bladder, that the Fibres being ouer-ſtretched, can not draw themſelues together, to expect the vrine: which happens to them which haue kept their water too long.Children muſt be often held out to piſſe. And for this cauſe, children muſt oft be called vpon to piſſe,

both when they awake, and when they are changed, to be laid downe to ſleep. And when they grow bigger, let them make water both before and after they eate: for ſince they abound with moiſtures, and haue their bladder but ſmall, they muſt in no wiſe keep their water long: and therefore if ſome-times they bepiſſe themſelues in their ſleep, they muſt not be much chidden, or beaten, for feare leaſt if they hold their water by force, they fall into this difficultie of voiding it.
                     If there be any fleagme, or ſlime, or bloud mingled with the water: or if there breed any ſand, or ſtone, this may be the cauſe to hinder the childs vrine. And this may happen to young children, as Hippocrates noteth:Hippocr. lib. 3. Aphoriſ. 26. becauſe they eat much, which procures much cruditie, and breeds the matter of the Stone.
                     
                        The Cure.For the Cure heerof; you muſt proceed according to the cauſe: which if it be, becauſe the vrine is ſharpe, and pricking, or too hote; then if it be a ſucking child, it will be good to preſcribe the Nurſe a dyet,A Diet for the Nurſe. to temper her bloud, which it may be is too hote. Let her alſo be purged, let bloud, and bathed; and let her vſe broaths made with coole herbes.
                     If the bladder of the child be too full of vrine, his bellie will be hard, and ſtrout out; and then let the Nurſe ſucke the end of his yard, and preſſe downe his bellie a little, toward the bladder: lay to his bellie water Creſſes, and Pellitorie of the wall fried. If this do no good, you muſt put vp finely

an hollow probe: and if there be any grauell, ſtone, or phlegme, the probe 
                           depiction of probe
                         will diſcouer it.
                     If the child be ſomewhat big, you may giue him this medicine.

                     Set him alſo in a little bath. Galen, and Auicen do much commend the water of Rapes, or Turneps, which you may giue with a little decoction of Parſley roots, Dogs tooth, and Dandelion.
                     But it happens oftentimes, that the child can not piſſe, by reaſon of ſome ſlime that ſtickes in the paſſage of the yard, which makes it ſwell, and puffe vp, and ſhew as cleare as a bladder.
                     For the help heerof, you muſt bring foorth the ſtone, by the help of a little inſtrument, like to this heere deſcribed, in the faſhion of an eare-picker; which you ſhall vſe in this maner.
                     You muſt hold downe the child faſt, that he ſtir not; and then the Chirurgion muſt take the yard betweene the fore-finger and the thumbe with his left hand, by that part, which is next toward the groine, that is beyond the ſtone: for feare, leaſt in the performance of the worke, it ſlip vp, and goe backe againe: Then holding the little inſtrument in his right

hand, let him put it vp into the paſſage of the the vrine, ſo far till he meete with the ſtone: which when he hath found, let him beare downe the inſtrument, to make it ſlip vnder the ſtone, for to catch hold of it, behind; and when he hath hold of it, let him draw it foorth in ſuch maner, as ſhall be needfull. And it will be neceſſarie to draw it out ſomewhat ſtrongly, becauſe oftentimes it ſtickes verie hard.
                     Sometimes it happens, that the Stone is ſo big, that it cannot be taken away by this meanes; and then we are conſtrained to make an inciſion in the yard; which muſt be done in this manner.
                     You muſt hold the yard faſt with the left hand, taking it by the midſt, ſo that halfe the thickneſſe of it may be betweene you finger and thumbe, and the other halfe out, that ſo the Stone may riſe and ſwell vp the more, on that ſide: Then on that ſide that the Stone ſwels vp, right ouer and againſt the Stone, let an inciſion be made, ſo deep, till you come to the Stone; which when you find, you ſhal put vnder it ſuch a ſmall inſtrument, as hath been before deſcribed, therewith to draw it foorth. And afterward let the wound be healed, as an other ordinarie wound: taking care, that there grow no little excreſcence of fleſh in the paſſage of the water.An experience of the Author. I haue practized this with verie good ſucceſſe: and amongſt others, vpon the ſonne of Monſ. Robert of Chartres.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     The meanes to helpe children that piſſe in their bed in the night, and cannot holde their water. CHAP. XXIX.
                     
                     
                        LIttle children doe commonly piſſe a bed, &amp; that for many reaſons: As becauſe they breed and abound (as wee haue already ſhewed) with ſtore of Vrine which commeth downe into the bladder, and that is ſo little, that it is not able to retaine and keepe it, being in ſo great quantity, beſides the Sphincter muſcle is very ſoft, and weake, by reaſon of the childs tenderneſſe: Againe, they doe ſo go about all the day long, that when are laid to bed, they ſleepe ſo ſoundly, that they cannot eaſily be wakened: wherto may be added, that they vſe to dreame often in the night, which makes them piſſe, thinking that they are awake. Some thinke that wenches are more ſubiect heereto then boyes.
                     Now for the deliuering and freeing them of this accident: diuers Phiſicions are of opinion, that it is beſt to let them alone, til they are grown bigger, and not to trouble them with many medicines: For the fibers of the Sphincter muſcle, which keepe the necke of the bladder ſhut together, grow dry, and ſtronger, and beſides then the child abounds not ſo much with moiſture, and by conſequence neither with vrine: but yet they muſt be hindred from drinking

ſo much (as they vſe in France) cleere water and alſo kept from eating ſo much raw fruite, and moiſt meats, and the like, which prouoke Vrine.
                     You muſt alſo endeuour to keepe children alwaies looſe bellied, which will make them piſſe the leſſe, as well in the night time, as in the day. And you muſt warne them to make water before they go to bed, and ſomtimes alſo you may waken them out of their ſleepe, to put them in minde thereof.
                     
                        The childe muſt bee put in minde to make water.You muſt alſo threaten them, that you wil whip them, and likewiſe make them aſhamed, of doing it. But yet for all this, you muſt not correct them too much: for I haue knowne ſome children (fearing to bee beaten, if they piſſed a bed) that haue tyed their yard themſelues, whereof hath followed a Gangrene: which hapned to Monſ. Paraeus, when he was a child, as he himſelfe hath told me.
                     When the child is growne ſomwhat big, let him eate roſted Cheſtnuts Filberds and A cornes: and drinke ſtil'd water, and a little Claret wine well allayed.

                     Of the accidents which happen to the childs yard, either before or after his birth. CHAP. XXXI.
                     
                     
                        THere may happen ſeuen accidents about the top and end of the childs yard, euen from his birth:Diuers imperfections of the Praeputiū. to witte, three in the Praputium or foreskin: and foure in the Glans or top thereof. Touching thoſe of the Praeputium, the firſt is when it is ſo ſtraight, and the hole ſo little, that the vrine beeing come foorth of the Glans, cannot paſſe through the skinne, but drop by drop, by reaſon it is ſhut ſo cloſe together; which makes part of the Vrine remaine betwixt the top of the yard and the Preputium. The ſecond is when the paſſage of the Preputium is not altogether ſo narrow, but yet it

cannot be put backe neither can the Glans bee vncouered;Phimoſis. which the Ancients haue called Phimoſis. The third is when the Praeputium cannot couer the Glans, becauſe it is ſlipped ouer,Paraphimoſis and drawne backward; called by the Ancients Paraphimoſis.
                     
                     Concerning theſe of the Glans: the firſt is, when there is no paſſage at all, in the end thereof: the ſecond is, when there is a paſſage, but the hole is too little. The third is, when the hole is not in the place where it ought to be, which is at the end, but is placed at the bottom or lower part of the Glans. The fourth is, when the top of the yard bendeth downward and makes the yard ſtand crooked and awry.
                     
                        Aristotle hath obſerued another kinde more ſtrange then thoſe, where he ſaith,An obſeruation of Ariſtotle. lib. 4. cap. 4. de generatione Animalium.
                         that there haue beene ſome male children, which naturally haue had no paſſage made at the end of the yard, but the hole hath bene lower in the Perinaeum, ſo that they were conſtrained to piſſe, as it were ſitting, &amp; when they held vp their Cods, or Scrotum, they ſeemed to be both man, and woman.
                     I haue heeretofore, for all the other accidents aboue named aduiſed the Nurſe to haue a care, and looke to them: But becauſe the cure of theſe belong properly to the Chirurgion to haue ſet it downe more at large,, and ſpecified it more particularly in this place that they may the better helpe it, conſidering the inconueniences, that may follow, as we will ſhew you.
                     For the firſt,What happens when the Praeputium is cloſed. which is when the skin of the yard is ſo ſtraight that the water cannot come foorth,

but drop by drop, this imperfection cauſeth a great deale of filth to be gatherd betwixt the Praeputium and the Glans, whereof proceedeth many troubleſome and dangerous vlcers, yea, and ſometimes a Gangrene. I haue obſerued it, in ſome young children, that the top of the yard, hath become blacke and blew with piſſing, through the very paine they endured.
                     The beſt way to remedie it, is to cut off the verie top and end of the Praeputium, thereby to take away a piece of it, as they doe in the Circumciſion. For the performance whereof, there be diuers meanes, but the ſafeſt and leaſt painfull way, is this.
                     
                        The order of cutting the Praeputium.
                        Firſt, it is to be conſider'd, that the Praeputium is double, ſo that when one thinks to cut both the skins, he cuts but one; for the ſecond leaps away eſpecially from betweene the Sizzers. Beſides, in cutting them both together, oftentimes you may cut more of the vppermoſt skin, then of the nethermoſt which is next to the Glans, which cauſeth it to remaine bare, and vncouered, whereof followeth great paine: it being fitter (for that occaſion) to cut away leſſe, of the firſt, then of the ſecond.
                     
                        The manner of doing it.Wherefore to preuent theſe accidents, the Chirurgion with his right hand muſt ſlide backward, ouer the Glans, the outward skinne or membrane of the Praeputium: and with the nails of his other hand hee muſt draw downward towards him the inner skinne, which is next to the Glans, then ſome other Chirurgion, or ſtander by, with a paire of pincers

made like vnto theſe, ſhall take 
                           depiction of pincers
                         hold of both the Membranes, ſo placed with the forkes of the ſaid Pincers, holding them very faſt, taking vp with them, neither more nor leſſe of the skinne then hee would haue cut off, leauing the Glans or Nut behind, and then with a very ſharpe Razer, he muſt cut away all that is without the forkes of the Pincers: when hee hath done ſo, let him looſen his inſtrument, and let it bleed a little: by which meanes, hee ſhall haue both the membranes euen: and not ſtanding out one more then the other, onely the outmoſt (it may bee) will a little come ouer, and couer the ſecond: This being done, the wound muſt be healed, as an ordinary wound.
                     I haue learned this manner of practiſe, of Monſ. de Maverne, the Kings Phyſition in Ordinary, who hath cauſed it to bee done after this faſhion: and it is the order and Methode, which the Iewes at this day, doe obſerue, in their circumciſion: If you haue not ſuch an inſtrument, you may take two little flat peeces of wood, and tye them


both together at one end, and then put the Praeputium betweene them, as we haue ſhewed, afterwards tying both the other ends together, reaſonable hard, &amp; then cut away ſo much of the Praeputium as is without the wood, after the ſame manner, as you ſee ſmiths cut off the tops of horſe eares.
                     This method may be alſo obſerued, when the Praeputium is too much enlarged, though it hinder not the vrine from comming foorth, which is commonly done, for feare leaſt it ſhould ſlip ouer the Glans in ſuch ſort that it could not come backe againe, and leaſt it might cauſe a Paraphimoſis, which is more dangerous then the Phimoſis, &amp; often hapneth to thoſe that are ſomwhat bigge. Neuertheleſſe we follow an other courſe in curing the Phimoſis more eaſily than the former, which is to ſlit the Praeputium at the bottom: &amp; we do it in this manner. Another way of curing the Phimoſis.
                         Firſt we ſtretch the Praeputium of al ſides drawing it a little towards vs, &amp; then wee ſlip in ſuch an inſtrument as you ſee heere, 
                           depiction of medical instrument
                         between

the Glans and the Praeputium, euen to the ſtring at the bottome of it, and there ſuddenly we deuide all the Praeputium below, hard by the ſtring, which I haue done very often, and not long ſince for an honeſt Gentleman, Monſ. Riolan the Chirurgion being with me. For with ſuch an inſtrument you ſhall cut aſunder both the skinnes euen, which you cannot do ſo well with the ſizzers, becauſe the vpper membrane cannot be wholly cut that way, which hath deceiued ſome, and myſelfe alſo at the firſt, beeing conſtrained to go to it againe, the ſecond time, which made me deuiſe this inſtrument.
                     As for the Paraphimoſis of little children,The Paraphimoſis of little children. it is of two ſorts: For the Praeputium being ſlipped vp ouer the Glans, it either ſtickes and ſtayes ſo, or elſe it is onely too ſhort, and will eaſily be brought ouer it againe and couer it, but not ſtaying ſo, it goes backe againe ſtraight: To that which doth cleaue and ſtick to it, it is not fit to do any thing, by reaſon of the youngeſſe of the child: And for the other, which is onely too ſhort,The Authors opinion. becauſe it breedes no inconuenience, I would aduiſe the Chirurgion not to meddle with it, but rather to defer the practiſe of it, till the child be grown bigger, and be able to endure it, which ſhall bee done in this ſort.
                     You muſt firſt of all,The method of doing it. turne backe all the Praeputium, that you may the better come at the inner membrane, which you muſt hold very faſt; &amp; make an inciſion round about it, the which inciſion muſt goe no deeper then the ſaid inner membrane: then letting it bleed well, you muſt make ſuch another

inciſion round about the vppermoſt membrane, which muſt go no deeper then to the nethermoſt: and preſently as ſoone as you haue made theſe two inciſions, you muſt pul out the Praeputium at length which will eaſily ſtretch, becauſe both the membranes by reaſon of the foreſaid inciſions, wil yeeld. Afterwards you muſt haue a care, that the ſaid inciſions grow not together again, and that the innermoſt membrane bee not glued, and ſticke to the Glans, or top of the yard: which you may hinder by laying betwixt them, fine little linnen rags, ſpread ouer with ſome ointment, which may ſerue alſo to heale the ſaid inciſion.
                     
                        An other waySome after they haue made theſe inciſions, pull the Praeputium quite ouer the Glans, and tye it reaſonable hard, that the vrine may haue a paſſage, as alſo by this meanes to keepe it from going backe againe, and then afterwards they vntie it, when they would dreſſe the inner inciſion.
                     
                        
                           Cornelius Celſus appointeth this kind of Cure.Some do onely pull ouer the Praeputium, and tie it as we haue ſhewne: then they make an inciſion round about the skin of the yard neare vnto the groine, being verie carefull, that they neither cut any veine that is in thoſe parts, nor of going ſo deep, as to the paſſage of the vrine: When they haue done thus, they draw the skin, toward the ligature, and lay ſome lint in the inciſion, to dilate it, and breed ſome fleſh therein. And it is to be obſeru'd, that the Praeputium muſt be alwaies tyed at the end, otherwiſe it would turne back againe, and the inciſion would grow together.
                     
                        But,
                           Aeginetas opinion. (as Paulus Aegineta ſaith) ſince theſe two accidents of the Praeputium, doe neither trouble them much, nor hurt any action: I would not counſaile them, to make the party ſuffer ſuch paine, whether he be young or old, nor to haue him trie the torment of ſuch experiments.
                     When it happens that there is no paſſage at the end of the yard, then muſt the Chirurgion verie cunningly make an hole there, that the vrine may haue free paſſage to come foorth: which being done, it muſt be kept open, and skinn'd ouer with little cearing candles put therein, which muſt be bow'd at the top, for feare leaſt they ſhould get whole into the bladder;A good obſeruation. which I haue ſeen happen vnto ſome: The ſaid cearing candle muſt be gently rub'd ouer with a little powder of Bole, and Tutia, and vpon it ſhall be laid a little plaſter of Refrigerans Galeni.
                     
                     If it chance, that the hole be not big enough, it muſt be widened with fine little cearing candles, fitted to the paſſage, and made with medicines that are ſomewhat corroſiue, thereby to fetch away the vpper skin of the hole: Taking great heed, that the candle go but a little way in; becauſe the paſſage is narrow and ſtraite onely at the end, the reſt being commonly large enough: And when the hole is wide enough, it muſt be cicatriz'd with the like cearing candles, as we haue ſhewne already, obſeruing the ſame methode as before.
                     When the hole of the yard is at the bottome, and not at the end, where it ought to be naturally:

If it may bee done poſſiblie, that the bottome of the Glans muſt be ſtopp'd vp, and an other made in the end of it: For thoſe that haue the hole ſo low, cannot piſſe ſtraight, but downeward, or elſe they are conſtrained to hold vp their yard toward their bellie. And when they grow to be men, their ſeed cannot be carried ſtraight, as it ought: which may be a meanes to hinder them from hauing children.
                     For the performance of the Cure, it will be verie needfull to excoriate the ſides of the ſaid paſſage, and to breed a little fleſh there, and afterwards to confirme and skin it: hauing firſt of all made another little hole at the end of the ſaid Glans, which muſt be dreſs'd and skinn'd with little cearing candles, as we haue ſhewne alreadie.
                     Beſides all the other accidents heretofore mentioned, I haue ſeen the yard of ſome children ſo crooked, that when it roſe and grew ſtiffe, the Glans or top of it was drawne, and bow'd quite downeward, which made them, that they could not piſſe ſtraight. This fault proceedeth from the ſhortneſſe of the ſtring, which holds the Glans ſo ſtraitely tyed, that it cannot ſtretch it ſelfe foorth when the yard growes ſtiffe.
                     
                        The Cure.As touching the Cure, both the Chirurgion and the Parents muſt be content to let it alone for a while, till the child be growne a little older, and bigger. And when they would put it in practize, they muſt watch their time to doe it, when the childs yard doth ſtand, and is ſtiffe: Then the Chirurgion

turning backe the Praeputium, ſhall vncouer the Glans, as gently as he can: and as he finds the ligament or ſtring to be too ſhort, he ſhall cut it in the middle, and preſently bring the Praeputium ouer it againe, that the Glans be not left bare: hauing firſt laid vpon the inciſion, a little chaw'd ſalt, as they doe to the ſtring of the Tongue, leaſt it ſhould grow together againe, and then he ſhall lay a little Emplaſter of Refrigerans Galeni round about the yard.

                        THere be ſome Maides, that are borne with their wombe quite ſhut vp, or that haue no naturall paſſage: which hapneth by means of ſome membrane, that is placed in that part, which cloſeth and ſhutteth vp the entrance, (for certainly there is none which naturally hath not a paſſage.) But becauſe there is ſomething found, that ſtops vp the entrance of it, therefore we ſay, that they haue none at all. This membrane is not alwaies ſeated in the ſame place, neither is it of the ſame forme, and compoſition, nor of the ſame matter: For in ſome, it is placed in the verie edge of the paſſage, and is eaſilie perceiued: and in others it lies deeper, neare vnto the inner orifice of the wombe.
                     
                        
                        Difference in figure.In reſpect of the figure, ſome are pierced through the middle: Others haue holes, like vnto a Sieue, and ſome haue none at all.
                     
                        Matter.Concerning the matter, ſome are membranous, and others are fleſhy: but thoſe which come euen from the birth, are rather membranous, then fleſhy children.
                     
                        The Cure.Thoſe that trouble little children, are cured in this ſort. Firſt, we muſt diligently conſider, and take good heed, where abouts the membrane is ſeated, or placed: for vndoubtedly, the deeper it is, the more dangerous and difficult will be the Cure.
                     But when it is at the brim, and edges of the outward necke of the wombe,The order to do it. and is plainly ſeen: the Chirurgion (after he hath placed the child, as is fit) ſhall cut aſunder the ſaid membrane, with his inſtrument directly in the middle, without going any farther: As ſoone as he hath made the inciſion, he ſhall lay vpon it, a little drie lint, that it come not together again: and ſome daies following, let him vſe ſome drying Ointment, which muſt bee laid on with fine linnen clouts, as hath bin ſhewed before.
                     To defer the Cure of it, till the child were growne elder, it might prooue more dangerous with the time:
                           Ariſtot. lib. 4. cap. 4. de gene ra
                                 •
                               Animal.
                         which hath been well obſeru'd by Ariſtotle, where he ſaith.
                     There bee ſome women, that haue euen from their birth, the necke of their wombe, as it were cloſed, and incorporated together: which hath continued ſo with them till the time they ſhould haue

their courſes, but when they haue beene ready to haue them, with the very paine, in ſome the ſaide necke hath broken open of it ſelfe, in others it hath beene opened by the Chirurgions, and when they haue beene conſtrained to open it by force, or that it could not be opened, there haue very many died of it.
                     This accident hath happened vnto diuers, and amongſt others to an honeſt maid who being ready to haue her courſes, fell very ſick, her belly ſwelled, with great prickings and ſhootings downward, and continuall vomiting, that troubled her, by the keeping backe of the ſaid courſes, which could not come away by reaſon of the membrane that ſtopped vp the paſſage. Which was very hard; for all the Phyſicions and Chirurgions, that looked vnto her, to find it out, who had appointed her diuers medicines, to bring downe her courſes: But when they ſaw, that all their medicines did her no good, they were of opinion to marry her, which was a meanes, that her husband found out her diſeaſe ſooner then any Phiſicion could. I was ſent for to helpe her, but by reaſon of the badnes, and danger of the way in trauaile, Monſ. le Fort, and M. Collo ſworne Chirurgions of Paris, were ſent thither: who after they had perceiued the diſeaſe, they cut the ſaid membrane, and made ſuch an inciſion, that there came out of it aboue three pound of congeled and clotted bloud, and as black as melted pitch which eaſed the patient very much. But whether it were, that the inciſion was but halfe made, or that

it had growne together againe, about a yeere afterward Mr. Pineau, and I were called to finiſh the Cure, which wee did with very good ſucceſſe after this manner.
                     
                        The manner of doing it.Hauing well conſidered the membrane (which was hard and glewie, and had a hole in the middle of it, whereinto you might haue put a large quill) wee were of opinion to inlarge it, by making three inciſions; which was done with ſuch an inſtrument as hath beene ſet downe before to cut the Praeputium; and then preſently we put in a Dilatory, ſuch a one as they vſe to dilate the wound with, when they would take a ſtone out of the bladder) therby to dilate and teare aſunder the reſt of the membrane, and to make the paſſage big enough for her to haue the vſe of her husband: and as ſoone as we had ſtretched it, wee preſently put into it a Peſſary made of ſiluer, of a conuenient bignes, which ſtayed there three daies together, and was neuer taken foorth, that the parts which had beene cut and torne aſunder, might not grow together againe, as it had done before.
                     At the three daies end, the ſaid peſſary was taken foorth, and others put in, made of linnen cloth, and couered with digeſtiue,A peſſary of Lead. and ſuppurating medicines: And when the ſaide vlcer was ready to heale, it was skinned with Peſſaries of Lead, applied as they ought to bee, and with others made of cloth, couered with cicatrizing medicines. The ſaid Gentlewoman was perfectly healed in three weekes.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of the fundament that is cloſed and ſtopped. CHAP. XXXIII.
                     
                     
                        AS the yard of a boy, and the naturall paſſage of a wench, are oftentimes found to bee cloſed and ſtopped vp, when they come into the World: So in like manner there are ſome of both ſexes, whoſe fundament is naturally cloſed &amp; ſtopped alſo, which commeth thus to paſſe by meanes of a Membrane, which hinders this paſſage.The fundament that is ſhut vp muſt be ſpeedily remedied. Wherfore, conſidering the accidents, yea and the danger of death, which doth often attend it, it will be very needfull to remedy it ſpeedily. For if the child bee not quickly purged of a certaine matter, and excrement, called Meconium, which he hath gathered together in his guts, all the while he hath beene in his mothers wombe, he is in danger to haue great and intollerable paines and gripings, and alſo to die in a ſhort ſpace: For the child cannot liue except he haue the benefit of nature that way.
                     The meanes to helpe it is this:The Cure. The Chirurgion muſt firſt open the childs buttocks, &amp; then let him conſider, whether there be a hole in the fundament or whether it be ſtopped by ſome membrane. If he perceiue, that the membrane is thinne, Paulus Aegineta counſelleth vs to teare it. But if it bee tough and ſtrong, the beſt way will bee for him to cut it

with a fine little inſtrument, and to go as deepe as the very fundament:How the euen Cure muſt be performed. which hee may know by putting gently into the fundament, after hee hath made the inciſion, a little fine probe, with ſome lint at the end of it: or elſe a peece of cearing Candle. Then the vlcer muſt be dreſ't with little linnen tents, couered ouer with ſome drying medicine, which muſt bee put into the fundament, leaſt the brims and edges therof, being raw and excoriated, ſhould grow together againe. And it would not be amiſſe, to let the child take a gentle Cliſter, to help to vnburthen him of the excrements that haue bin retained. And ſince that the ſtaying or ſtopping of them, as I ſaide before, is oftentimes cauſe of the childs death, it wil not be from the matter to relate this ſtory.
                     
                        A ſtory.Not long ſince, the wife of Monſ. de Cugy, Mr. of the Munition in the Arcenal of Paris, was deliuer'd of a little Daughter, which had the paſſage of her fundament ſhut vp. After ſhe was born, ſhe was deliuered vnto the Nurſe to be carried into the country, where ſhe continued ſeuen or eight daies, without voiding any thing by ſtowle, which made her belly ſwel extreamely. Wherupon ſhe was brought vnto this Citty, and Monſ. Rabigois, a Maſter Barber Chirurgion and ſworn at Paris, a very diligent and painfull man was ſent for, to ſee what might be the cauſe of this ſwelling: and he inquiring whether the child went to ſtoole or no: it was anſwered him by the nurſe ſhe had neuer purged her ſelfe as yet that way, ſince ſhe was born: then by &amp; by he ſearched

the fundament, and found it to be cloſed and ſtopped vp, and therefore he did counſell the childs father to let him make an inciſion of the membrane, that ſtopped vp the paſſage: whereunto the Father and Mother would not conſent, till the morrow. But while the matter was debated and argued vpon, the child dyed: And ſhe was opened by the ſaide Maſter Rabigois, who found all her guts filled, with the humor, called Meconium, and other filthie matter.
                  
                  
                     Of the ſcabbe which comes on the childs head and face. CHAP. XXXIIII.
                     
                     
                        OFtentimes there commeth vppon the childs head and face a hard cruſty ſcab, which couereth all the head quite ouer (and therefore it is called the Cappe) and ſometimes the face alſo: ſo that you can ſee nothing but the childs eyes, as though hee had a maske on. The Latines call this ſcabbe Lactumen,
                        
                           Lactumen. Lactitium.
                         or Lactitium, as being an excrement of the Milke: And becauſe it is of a yellow colour, like vnto waxe, it is alſo called Cerium. The cauſe heereof,
                           Cerium.
                         is two fold, for eyther it is engendred of the reliques of the womens courſes or purgings:The Cauſe. or elſe of the Nurſes milke, which being of an ill quality, doth eaſily corrupt in the childs ſtomacke, and cannot bee turned into good iuice, and much leſſe bee corrected

by the Liuer, it being ſent thither to bee turned into bloud: which makes it, that being carried vnto the head and face, it cannot be aſſimilated in thoſe parts.
                     Leaſt this ſcab might corrode, and eat into the skinne, and afterwards the very bone of the head and face, and at length Gangrene the eies: it will be very good to remedy it.
                     For which purpoſe, the Nurſe muſt keepe a good dyet, as we haue formerly ſhewne.
                     
                        The Cure.Concerning Topicall or outward medicines, you muſt haue an eſpeciall care, that you vſe none that do repell, and driue backe, but rather ſuch as gently draw.
                     You may bath the cruſts, eſpecially thoſe of the face, with gentle Fomentations made of Mallowes, Althaea, Violet leaues, Chamomile and Melilot flowers and Linſeed, boyled in milke: and with this decoction you may foment the cruſts, and afterwards annoint them with Oile of ſweet Almonds, Freſh Butter well beaten with Parietary water, and Oile of Violets waſhed with Barley water.
                     I am wont to vſe an Ointment of Lard melted, and then well beaten and waſhed with Parietary water, and ſo annoint the cruſts with it.
                     If there be any vlcer, and that the ſcabs are fallen off; you may lay vpon it a Cabbidge, or a Beete leafe, a little heated on a Gridyron. The Ointment made of white Waxe, and oile of ſweet Almonds, is very good, when there is any rawneſſe, or excoriation.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of the Meazels, and the ſmall Pockes, what they are, and how they doe differ. CHAP. XXXV.
                     
                     
                        IT remaineth now, that we ſpeake of the Meaſells, and the ſmall Pockes: and becauſe there bee few children but haue them eyther firſt or laſt,Few children eſcape the ſmall pocks. I haue thought good, heere to ſay a word or two of them briefly.
                     The Meaſels and the Pocks,What the meaſels and the pocks are. are little riſings or puſtules, which appeare moſt commonly in great number, vpon the outſide of the skinne: and at the firſt, they are ſo like one another, that you can hardly diſcerne whether of them it is. But yet the Meaſels come more ſuddenly, and the face and skinne of the whole body lookes redder: and the redneſſe continues longer without riſing; there beeing ioined with it moſt commonly a greater itching and pricking.Difference. But the ſmall pockes comes not foorth ſo ſuddenly, neither is the skinne ſo red: nor doth the colour ſtay ſo long: the puſtules or pimples riſe higher, neither itching nor pricking ſo much, and at length grow white.
                     The cauſe of both of them,Cauſe. are the reliques of the impurer part of the bloud, wherewith the child was nouriſhed in his Mothers wombe; which now is ſeparated and thruſt to the skin, through the help and ſtrength of nature, becauſe the childs bloud

boileth in the veines of euery part of the bodie: (as Auicen ſaith) No otherwiſe then new wine doth in a veſſell,A good compariſon. which boyleth, caſting vp his froath, or ſcum, and ſeparating it from it ſelfe. And, (as Auenzoar ſaith) though the child be nouriſhed, with the beſt part of the menſtruall bloud, yet there remaines ſome little portion behind, which is of an ill qualitie; and after the child is borne, and is growne ſtrong, he gathering together his forces and naturall heat, thruſts it foorth by the pores of the skin, nature being willing to acquite and rid her ſelfe of this ſuperfluitie.
                     Beſides, there is a certaine diſpoſition of time, cauſed through the malignitie of the aire, which raiſeth and ſtirreth vp the reliques of the ſaid menſtruall bloud in the childs bodie, wherewith he hath been nouriſhed: vnto which the corrupt aire (that we breath, and which we cannot auoide) doth adde an impreſſion, of a ſecond bad qualitie, wherewith nature being ouer-charg'd and offended, ſhe thruſts them out to the skin, which receiueth the filth and vncleanneſſe of the bodie.
                     Now, the fuller the bodie is, of this menſtruall bloud, the deeper impreſſion doth the outward aire make in it: which is the reaſon, that ſome haue them in greater quantitie, and are fuller of them, then others: And ſo according to the malignitie of the humour, it is alſo more, or leſſe dangerous to ſome, then to others.
                     
                        Signes.The marks and ſignes whereby you may know that the child will haue the Pockes, are theſe:

Headach, together with an Ague, redneſſe of the eyes, which water verie often, itching of the noſe, a drie Cough, gaping, wearineſſe of the bodie, paine of the Hart, deſire to vomit, the vrine red, a pricking, and ſhiuering through all the bodie, and ſometimes convulſions, and rauings. When it is the Meaſels, the face growes red, and ariſeth all at once: but when it is the Pocks, neither the face, nor the reſt of the bodie looke ſo red: but you may perceiue ſome little riſings here and there, in the face, backe, breaſt, and thigh's, which afterwards increaſe, and grow bigger.
                     And when the Pocks begin to ſhew themſelues, then there happens heauineſſe of the head, the face ſwelleth, the eyes are ſetled, all the bodie becomes as it were puff'd vp, the voice growes hoarſe, with difficultie of fetching breath, and ſoreneſſe of the throat: For it is the propertie of this vile diſeaſe, to take hold of the Lungs; and yet we ſee oftener then we would, that the ſmall Pocks do fall euen vpon the bones, and corrupt them.
                     The ſigneſ to iudge of the euent of them,Good ſignes. are theſe: If the Ague be but little, and diminiſheth as the Pocks come foorth: if they be but few in number, and thoſe ſcattered here and there: if they come foorth eaſily, without much paine, and that the child is not much diſquieted, if they grow white and ripen quickly: theſe are ſignes of recouerie. But if the Ague continue, and increaſe at the comming foorth of them,Bad ſignes. if they thruſt foorth in great quantitie, one vpon another; and if they run as it

were all into one ſcab, not ripening ſpeedily; if the child be verie hoarſe, and not able to ſpeake; or fall into a bloudie flixe, theſe are ill ſignes. The firſt ſheweth, that it hath ſeized vpon the Lungs: and the ſecond, that it fretteth the guts.
                     Againe, the ſmall Pocks is verie dangerous, when it comes foorth with paine and griefe, though they be white. When they be ſmall, greene, blewiſh, or blacke, and that they ſinke downe, and grow drie on the ſuddaine, not comming to maturation and ſuppuration: if the child piſſe bloud, and then by and by after his vrine turnes to be blacke, it is ſigne of death.
                     
                        The ſignes of the Meaſels.Concerning the Meaſels, if they be but reaſonable red, and haue no ill accidents ioined with them, but go away ſuddainly, they are not to be feared: But when they are high colour'd, or if they be blewiſh, or greeniſh, accompanied with vomiting, paine of the heart, weakneſſe, the bloudie Flixe, and the like, they are verie dangerous.
                  
                  
                     Of the cure of the Meaſels, and ſmall Pockes. CHAP. XXXVI.
                     
                     
                        IN all diſeaſes that happen vnto little Children, and eſpeciallie in the cure of this preſent ſickneſſe, the Chirurgion muſt not be too haſty, nor do any thing raſhly: For there be many oftentimes deceiued, which think that the child will not haue the Pocks,

or Meaſels, becauſe at the firſt they haue but a little Ague, or Head-ach, or ſome other light ſigne of it: ſeeing, that this diſeaſe lyeth long in the bodie, before it makes any ſhew.
                     And therefore, not without good cauſe, haue the ancient writers obſerued;
                           Hippocrates.
                         that ſometimes it is better to do nothing, than to begin amiſſe, oftentimes altering thereby natures courſe. Neuertheleſſe, you cannot do amiſſe, in giuing the child ſome little preſeruatiues, as Vnicornes horne, Bezoard ſtone, and Cordiall waters, cauſing him to be kept quiet, without taking the aire, eſpecially if it be cold weather.
                     But as ſoone as the Chirurgion perceiueth,How the Pocks muſt be help'd. that the child is taken with an Ague, and that he hath the ſignes heretofore mentioned, he muſt proceed in this manner to the cure of them.
                     Firſt he muſt haue a care,The Cure. in what place the child is laid, ſeeing that this diſeaſe doth partly proceed of a maligne and contagious aire, which after that it hath beene drawne and carried by the Lungs, to the hart, and other parts of the body, it leaues there an impreſſion of his bad quality, in that part of the menſtruall bloud, wherewith the child was nouriſhed in the mothers womb, wherefore let the child be kept in good aire, that is neither too hot, nor too cold. For being too hot, it may cauſe the childe to haue faintings and ſwounings, and being too cold, as the Pockes, or Meaſels are comming foorth,The Place. it may keepe them backe, and driue them in againe, and ſo hinder nature from expelling and putting

foorth the impurities, that are in the body. And therefore he muſt be kept warme in his bedde, and reaſonably well couered. Such as are more nice and curious, doe hang the bed round with red couerlets: If it be winter, it will be good to haue a fire in the Chamber, to rectifie the Ayre, which perhaps is of the coldeſt, and alſo to correct ſome ill quality, which it may haue, as Rhaſis and Auicen write. If it bee in heate of Summer it will not bee needfull to make ſo much fire, nor to keep the child couered ſo warme.
                     Concerning his meate and drinke: if the childe ſucke,His Diet. then muſt the Nurſe keepe a good diet, as wee haue heeretofore preſcribed, and as if ſhe her ſelfe had an Ague. If the child be weaned, he muſt abſteine from eating all manner of fleſh, no not ſo much as of a little Chicken, till the pocks be whollie come foorth. But (as Auicen ſaith) he may vſe Broths made with Capons or Chickens wherein you muſt put good ſtore of Sorrel,Broths. Cichory, Bugloſſe, Borage, and Lettuce: Hee may alſo vſe the ſtrained broth of Peaſe, Lentils, and Barley waters made with Figs, Dates, Rayſings of the ſunne alſo, Gelly Prunes, and roſted apples, well ſugred. For his drinke let him vſe a Ptiſane,His Drinke. made of Barley and Licoriſe, adding thereunto ſome Rayſings of the ſunne, Figs, and Dates, but in ſmall quantity. If that drinke pleaſe him not, then let him vſe this drinke following.
                     
                        An excellent Drinke. 
                        Take of French Barley a handfull, ſhauings of Iuory, and Harts horne tied in a little linnen cloth, of

each two drammes. Boyle them in a quart of water, and when it is almoſt ſodden, put to it halfe an ounce of Licoriſe, halfe a Citron peal'd and cut in ſlices: then ſtraine it, and let him drinke of it at his Meales, and when hee is thirſty. When the Pockes are quite come foorth, and begin to looke white, and that the Ague grows leſſe &amp; leſſe, then he may eate a little ſtronger meate, and drinke a little water and Wine: his meate and drinke muſt not be actually cold.
                     And becauſe the pockes do come in the mouth, tongue, and throat,A lenifying and ſoupling Drinke. as alſo all along the wind-pipe you may put to his drinke, a little ſuger, or ſirup of Violets, Iuiubes or Cherries, and chiefly to that he drinketh betweene meales. This drinke lenifieth &amp; ſuppleth the roughneſſe and excoriations, it is good for the Lungs, and the hoarſeneſſe wherewith they are troubled, and alſo it cleanſeth gently.
                     For his ſleepe, that muſt be moderate,His ſleepe. if at the firſt hee bee very drowſie and heauie, he muſt bee wakened, forfeare leaſt his head be filled with vapors: But it is alſo fit, if he cannot take his reſt, to giue him ſomwhat to make him ſleepe. For ſleepe doth well concoct the humors, and maketh the Pockes come foorth the better: And for this purpoſe you may giue him ſome fine Barley waters, and put into his Broths ſome Lettuce, and the cold ſeeds, and at night you may giue him a little ſpoonfull of ſirup of Iuiubes, Nenuphar and Violets, mingled together, abſteining from all Narcoticall, or ſtupifying medicines.
                     
                        If he be bound, and cannot go to the ſtoole, you may giue him inwardly a little Oile of ſweete Almonds, newly drawne, or a little Hony, as Auicen appointeth: which Auenzoar allows not of, becauſe he had taken ſome of it, (as he ſaith) when hee had the Pockes, where with he thought he ſhould haue died. It will not be amiſſe, to giue him a ſpoonfull of Caſsia, and if his belly be not looſe, you may giue him this gentle Cliſter.

                     Concerning bloud-letting, if the child bee ſomwhat bigge,Bloud letting. as of three or foure yeare old, or if he be of a very ſanguine complexion, and that the Ague bee accompanied with vnquietneſſe, toſſing to and fro, rauing, difficulty of breathing, and inflammation of the eyes. I would aduiſe you to draw a little bloud from him, which I haue ſeene practized, (in the firſt daies of the ſickneſſe) by the beſt Phiſicions of this Citty.
                     
                        Rhaſis and Auicen commaund, that at the beginning we doe open the veine of the Noſe: and they ſay moreouer that many haue very happily beene freed of this diſeaſe, by bleeding at the Noſe: becauſe the matter that breedeth the pockes, hath beene diminiſhed thereby: and alſo it hindreth the violent ebullition of the bloud, that it aſcends not in ſo great quantity, vp into the head and face, or keepes it from taking hold on any part, as the lungs or guts: So that nature being disburdened of part

of this humour, expelleth and thruſteth out the reſt more eaſily.
                     The ſame Authors for the bringing of them foorth the ſooner, and with the leſſe paine doe appoint that the child ſhould take this drinke.

                     If the child be ſo little that hee cannot take this drinke, then the Nurſe muſt be carefull to drinke a good draught of it her ſelfe morning and euening.
                     Whileſt that this diet is obſerued, and the foreſaid medicines vſed, you may giue the child ſome of this cordiall Iulep.

                     But becauſe for the moſt part, this maligne humor ſeazeth vpon the eies, noſe, eares, throate and lungs, it will bee very good to defend and fortifie them, that they may be as little offended, as may bee.

                        The Lungs.The Lungs muſt be preſerued with medicines, that do lenifie and ſouple the Trachea arteria: which may be done with Syrup of Iuiubes, Nenuphar, and

Violets: Alſo let him hold in his mouth Suger Candie, Lozenges of Diatragacanthum frigidum, and Trochiſa bechici.
                     
                     Three or foure daies after the Pocks are come foorth, you muſt rub the face with Oile of ſweet Almonds, drawne without fire, to make them ripen the ſooner, or elſe with this Liniment.
                     Take old Lard, and cut it into pieces, and melt it, when it is melted, ſtraine it through a cloth, then waſh and beat it well with water, and annoint the face with it.
                     When the Pocks are come to maturation, and are ripe enough, which you may know by their whiteneſſe, as alſo when they feel them begin to itch (which happens commonly toward the eighth or ninth day,) that they may be the ſooner dried, and leaue no marks or pits behind them, the face muſt be annointed with this medicine, which I haue vſed, and found to haue done much good.
                     
                        Take two drams of Chalke,
                        An approued medicine.

                     This medicine doth kill and drie vp the Puſtules, which will fall away of themſelues, without pulling them off: and the skin vnderneath will be ſmooth, and euen, without any dent or hollowneſſe.

                     The meanes to preſerue little Children from the Meaſels, and the Pockes. CHAP. XXXVII.
                     
                     
                        THe ſmall Pockes, and the Meaſels do much annoy, and bring many inconueniences vnto children: For dailie experience ſheweth vs, that many die thereof, and thoſe which eſcape, do oftentimes beare the marks and badges of this vile diſeaſe. I haue ſeene diuers children, that haue been lame and

maymed, both of their armes, and legges, through the verie malignitie of the humour, that fell downe vpon their tender ioints and bones:Diuers accidents. Others haue loſt their eyes: or at the leaſt there hath remayned ſome pearle, or ſpot vpon them: Others haue had their eyes ſtaring, red, or watring: Some haue been deafe, and dull of hearing: Others haue had their noſe and mouth ſhrunke together, or elſe puffed vp: and ſome haue been hoarſe afterwards all their life time: The leaſt accident of all is, that many haue remained disfigured with pits and holes in their faces.
                     So that if they could be preſerued from them,To preſerue children from the Meaſels &amp; ſmall Pocks. it would both be a great contentment to their Parents, and an eaſe to themſelues. Now, as this diſeaſe is cauſed (as we haue ſaid) of the reliques of the menſtruall bloud, wherewith the child hath been nouriſhed, ſtirr'd vp by the malignitie of the aire (which it is impoſſible to ſhun or auoid:) So to go about to preſerue a child from it, we muſt do two things; The firſt ſhall be, to ſhun and auoid this corrupted Aire, and to rectifie it the beſt we can poſſiblie: The ſecond is, to euacuate and purge away the reliques of this humour, and to make them leſſe hurtfull.
                     Wherefore, both the Nurſe and the child muſt liue in a houſe, that ſtands in a good aire, far from any ſinkes, priuies, or Church-yards, from whence there ariſe many vnholſome vapours, and exhalations: Her chamber muſt haue a good aire, rather ſtanding high, then low: Let the window looke

rather toward the North, or the Eaſt, then to the South, or the Weſt. If the weather be not too cold, let the caſements ſtand open, to aire the chamber. If it bee verie colde, they muſt bee ſhutte, and you muſt make a good fire, burning ſome Iuniper, Roſemarie, or Cypres, vſing alſo ſometimes a little ſweet perfume. If the chamber be too hote, you muſt ſtrew it with Ruſhes, &amp; a few Vine leaues, Violet leaues, Nenuphar, and Roſes, ſprinkling it with coole water, and a little Vineger.
                     
                        The Nurſes and the childs dyet.The Nurſe muſt keep a good diet, ſuch as we haue heretofore preſcribed: ſhe muſt drinke water a little coloured with wine, and if the childe bee weaned, he muſt keepe the ſame kind of diet: His meate muſt bee ſeaſoned with the iuice of an Orenge, and you ſhall alſo put ſome iuice of Lemons into his Broths, but you muſt parboyle it a little that it hurt not his ſtomacke.
                     
                        Their ſleepe.Both the Nurſe and the child muſt ſleepe moderately: ſhe muſt not ſleepe after dinner, vnleſſe ſhe haue not reſted in the night, by reaſon her childe hath beene froward, who may ſleepe a little in the day time, after dinner, if he be not weaned.
                     
                        Purging.The Nurſe alſo and the child (if he be any thing big) may be gently purged with Caſſia, Rubarbe, Senay, ſirup of Cichory with Rubarbe; and ſirup of Damaske Roſes.
                     
                        Letting bloudIf you perceiue that both their bodies bee plethoricall, or full, it will be fit to draw a little bloud: which muſt be vnderſtood, if the child be three or foure yeeres old.
                     
                        And concerning medicines, either Generall, or Topicall: I refer you to the former chapter, which haue as much power and vertue to preſerue one from the diſeaſe, as to cure it after it is come.
                  
                  
                     Of the French Pocks which happeneth vnto Children. CHAP. XXXVIII.
                     
                     
                        THe French Pocks may happen to a child, either from his mothers womb or elſe by the Nurſes fault, who may be defiled and infected with it.
                     The ſignes are like vnto thoſe,Signes. which are obſerued in elder perſons: but the moſt common are Puſtules, Vlcers, and Excoriations, which appeare chiefly about the childs buttockes and thighs.
                     As for the Cure, we muſt haue a reſpect,The Cure. both to the nurſe, and the child. If the child hath taken it of the Nurſe, ſhee muſt be put away, and hee muſt haue another: who muſt take ſuch a dyet as is commonly preſcribed for thoſe, that are infected with this diſeaſe.
                     Firſt, ſhee ſhall bee purged, and let bloud,Her diet. ſhee muſt keepe a good diet, and eate rather boyled meat, than roſted, becauſe the decoctions ſhe muſt vſe will dry her the better to breed ſufficiently: as alſo milke to nouriſh the child.
                     Let her drinke euery morning of this or the like decoction,The vſe of the Decoction. hauing a care to make it either weaker

or ſtronger, according to her temper, and the time of the yeare: But before ſhee takes it, you muſt giue her ſome of the Opiate following.
                     Both of them haue power to make her milke medicinall, and to hinder the child from imparting the diſeaſe vnto her ſo ſoone, as otherwiſe he might do, if ſhe tooke no preſeruatiue.

                     After ſhe hath ſweat, ſhe muſt not giue her child ſucke preſently: but ſhee muſt reſt, and coole her ſelfe a little, and then giue him the teate: But firſt ſhe ſhall rub it with a little Aqua Theriacalis, to reſiſt and hinder the infection.
                     If you cannot find a Nurſe, that will venter to giue the child ſucke, in ſtoede thereof, you ſhall

                     And becauſe the true Antidote againſt this diſeaſe, is Quickſiluer, therefore will it be very fit to annoint the childs puſtules with ſome ſuch Ointment, not bringing him to a fluxe of the mouth.

                     Of the breeding, and comming foorth of Haires on childrens backes and raines, called in Languedocke Maſquelon, and of the Latins, Morbus pilaris. CHAP. XXXV.
                     
                     
                        IT had been more agreeable and conuenient, to haue ſet downe this diſeaſe, in the Chapter of the Vnquietneſſe and Crying of little children: But as this booke was euen almoſt printed, Mr Toignet, a Barber Chirurgion of Paris, put me in mind of this diſeaſe, that happens vnto little Children, which is verie common in Languedocke, and is called in their language Maſquelon. Hauing enquired of diuers Phyſicions, about this diſeaſe, and amongſt the reſt, of Monſ. Riollan, Doctour of Phyſicke in Paris, and the Kings Profeſſor in Chirurgerie, a verie learned and painfull gentleman; he told me, that Montanus had written of it,
                           Morbus Pilaris.
                         and that he called it Pilaris affectio.
                     
                     As ſoone as little Children are taken with this diſeaſe, they crie and take on extreamely, and yet one can not perceiue any cauſe, why they ſhould do ſo; which brings them oftentimes euen to their graue, for that this diſeaſe drawes along with it Epylepticall convulſions: becauſe the Sinewes

which come foorth of the backe-bone, and are ſcattred on each ſide, are ouer burthened, and fill'd with ſome fuliginous vapour, of which Haires are bred, and they by their great length, and continuitie, are carried directlie to the braine: whither when they are come, they cauſe this diſeaſe.
                     The women of the Countrie of Languedocke, becauſe it is a common diſeaſe with them, make no great reckoning of it, and doe helpe it in this manner.
                     With the palme of their hand, they do rub the bottome of the childs backe and raines downe to the crupper bone ſo long, till they feele through the pores of the skin, the tops of verie ſtiffe and pricking Haires to come foorth, like vnto hoggs briſtles: which as ſoone as they ſee, that they are come foorth, they pull them away by and by with their nayles, or elſe with ſuch little pincers, as women vſe to pull the haire from off their eyebrowes.
                     The ſame Montanus counſelleth the woman, to rub her hand firſt with ſome new Milke: which being done, and the Haires pull'd away, the child preſently recouers his health, and leaueth his ordinarie cries and laments.
                     There may alſo happen vnto little Children diuers other diſeaſes, beſides theſe that I haue ſpoken of: But becauſe they bee common as others are, and ſuch as may happen to one of any age: as

Wounds, Vlcers, Impoſtumes, Fractures, Luxations, and ſoreneſſe of the Head; we haue willinglie omitted them for breuitie ſake: And alſo for that you may haue recourſe to thoſe, that haue written thereof more particularly in their Chirurgerie.
