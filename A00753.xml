            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  The like notes vpon euery Chapter of the bookes of Exodus and Leuiticus.
                  
                     TOuching this booke of Exodus in genenerall, wée may note two things in it. Firſt, the authority of it, and ſecondlie, the profit we may take by it. The authority of it very well appeareth by ſuch allegations, as are made out of it in the new Teſtament, for the confirmation Marke. 12. 26. Rom. 9. 17. of moſt weighty points of our Chriſtian faith, as the reſurrectien of the dead, our free election by grace, not by merit, with other ſuch like. The profit of it is double, hiſtoricall, and myſticall. Hiſtoricall, by notable examples of Gods wrath and mercy Wrath, towards the Egiptians, Male

                     hites, and ſuch like: mercy, towards the Iſraelites, Hiſtorical profit. and thoſe that ſhew mercy vnto them, as Rahab, the Midwiues, and others. The former may teach the wicked to beware, becauſe God certainely payeth home at the laſt. The latter may confirme all true beléeuers in Gods promiſes, which euer were and ſhalbe performed in their time. Alſo, make vs patient to endure the Lords good pleaſure euer, ſéeing he both ſo gratiouſlie regardeth, and ſo mercifully moderateth the afflictions of his children. Both the points togither may teach vs that kingdomes &amp; gouernments are diſpoſed by God, euen as ſhall pleaſe his holy will. For hée ſetteth vp, and he taketh downe, hée eſtabliſheth and changeth, according as hée is ſerued

and obeyed by Princes and people, gouerning, and gouerned. Able to ſhiuer in péeces the greateſt that euer was, and as able againe to ſupport the weakeſt, when he pleaſeth. The myſtical profit of this booke is a declaration of our Sauiour Chriſt and Myſticall profit. the merits of his paſſion, which is moſt notablie made héerein by types and figures and liuelie reſemblances, as will appeare in their places.
                  The whole booke may bée deuided into theſe two parts: The Deuiſion of the booke. birth, as it were, and the beginning of the Church, in the firſt fiftéene Chapters. Then, the education and bringing vp of the ſame, in the reſt of the booke.
                  
                     CHAP. 1.
                     
                        
                           This firſt Chapter hath theſe chiefe heads in it.
                           
                              The multiplication of the Iſraelites.
                              The crueltie of the Aegyptians.
                              The vertue of the Midwiues.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        COncerning ye firſt point, you ſée in the fifth verſe, that all the ſoules which came out of the loines of Jacob into Egypt with him, were but ſeuentie ſoules: of which little flocke God made ſuch an increaſe, as the Egyptians grew afraide of it. For they brought-forth fruite and increaſed in aboundance, ſaith the ſeuenth verſe, and were multiplied, and were excéeding mightie, ſo that the land was full of them. Some make the Hebrew word to ſignifie an increaſe like corne, where one graine bringeth forth thirty, ſixty,

or a 100. Some, as fiſhes, which multiply in greater number than any creature. R. Salamoh ſaith, the womē had oft foure and fixe at a burden, God ſo prouiding to fulfill his promiſe touching their increaſe, Geneſis 22. 17. In the booke of Numbers, you may more particularlie ſée what came of euerie one. For Reuben, the eldeſt ſon of Jacob, ſo increaſed, that his branches there are ſaide to be ſixe and forty thouſand and fiue hundered. Simeon, his ſecond ſonne, increaſed to nine and fifty thouſand, thrée hundered and fifty; Gad, his third ſonne, to fiue and forty thouſand, ſix hundred and fifty, and ſo for the reſt, read their increaſe in that place. Whereof to make ſome good vſe to our ſelues, wée may note and marke firſt, the truth of Gods propromiſe made to Abraham in the 15. of Gen. when he bad him looke vp to the ſtars of heauen, and number them, if hée could, aſſuring him then, that euen ſo would hée make his poſteritie and ofſpring a mightie people, and a great kindred, which wée all ſée héere was fulfilled. So aſſuredlie true are all other of Gods promiſes, and therefore thinke of what you will, your faith and comfort ſhal not faile you. That ſwéete promiſe, that, at what time ſoeuer a ſinner repenteth truly of his ſinnes, God in mercy will forgiue him, it ſhall neuer faile. Hée may as ſoone ceaſe to bée God, as ceaſe to be true in any thing which hée hath ſpoken. And for this particular he hath not onely ſpoken it, but ſworne it, that, as he liueth he will not the death of any true pe

                           itent and ſorrowfull ſinner. Wée may not therefore do him wrong, and doubt of it. It is no pride to take faſt Non eſt

                           d confeſſio non ingrati. Aug. hold of this word, but it is duty due from vs to confeſſe his truth, and to be thankefull. An other promiſe he hath made to vs, that, if we ſeeke the kingdome and the righteouſneſſe thereof, theſe worldly wants of ours ſhall euer be ſupplied, as ſhall bée fit and good for vs. This alſo will he as aſſuredlie kéepe, as he is God, to the great quietneſſe of our hearts, if wée will beléeue him. In a word, that promiſe of all promiſes, that, if we beleeue in his Son, we ſhall neuer periſh, but haue eternall life, hée will performe. So, both for this life, and that to come, wée haue his word: and, no more than hée failed Abraham in multiplying his ſéede, will he faile vs in any promiſe. Only his time wée muſt tarry, and haſty mindes learne humble patience. Hée knoweth when is beſt both for him, and vs. Tary

hée may, but come hée will. Neuer vntruth paſſed from him, neuer any that beléeued in him was diſappointed of his hope. Secondly, we may obſerue héere the riſing of houſes and families, The 2. vſe. whence it is, euen from the Lord, who bleſſeth where he pleaſeth with increaſe of children, &amp; maketh a name ſpread, as likewiſe drieth vp and cutteth off, as he pleaſeth, others. It muſt make vs ceaſe from enuie, where we ſée increaſe, and ſtay raſh iudgment, where we ſée decreaſe. For it is the Lords worke: in whoſe matters wée muſt well beware how wée meddle. A third vſe ariſeth from the time of this increaſe, which The 3. vſe. was chiefelie and eſpecially after Ioſephs death, whereupon S. Auſtin giueth this obſeruation. Ioſeph is dead &amp; the children of Iſrael increaſe, what is this, my brethren? As long as Ioſeph liued they are not ſaid to increaſe, but after his death. Surely, bretheren, theſe things figured in that Ioſeph, were fulfilled in in our Ioſeph. For before our Ioſeph died, few beléeued in him, but after his death and reſurrection, throughout all the world the Iſraelites increaſed and multiplied, that is, the Chriſtians. So ſaide the Lord himſelfe in the Goſpell, except the corne die, that falleth into the gronnd, it remaineth but it ſelfe alone, but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruite. Now, not in Iudaea onely is Chriſt known, but frō the riſing of the ſun, to the going downe of the ſame, &amp;c. Thus may we profit by their multiplication.
                     2. The ſecond head in this chapter is the crueltie of the Egyptians: by meanes whereof a very bitter and heauie affliction The affliction of the Iſraelites. followed this great and glorious multiplication. The vſe to our ſelues may bée this, that euen ſo dooth aduerſity follow proſperitie, and therefore proſperity ſhould euer prepare for aduerſitie. A wiſe man in his good day thinketh of his euill, and dayly beholding the ſunne ouer ſhadowed at times with a darke cloude maketh vſe of it to his good. Sorrow and ioy wil not dwell togither, but by compoſition they were thus agréed, as the Poets feigne, that as ſoone as the one hath had a time, the other ſhall enter and haue his time alſo, the former paſſing away and giuing place. Let no wiſe-man therefore ſay as Dauid ſaid, tuſh, tuſh, this eſtate ſhall neuer decay, for the Lord turned his face, and Dauid was ſoone troubled. Iob on a day could not thinke on ſuch a change as after happened to

him, and yet all to the glorie of God, and his good. No earthly father louing his childe doth forbeare to chaſtice him: much leſſe dooth the father of Spirits leaue his children without fit corvection, ſince both hée loueth more, and knoweth how better to correct for their good. The path to heauen is beaten out through many tribulations: and vp muſt euery man and woman take their croſſe that will bée his in eternall comfort.
                     Let vs note againe in this place, the cauſes of this their affliction &amp; oppreſſion, as the Spirit of wiſedome, for our good, hath héere laide them downe. The firſt is, their very increaſing, and multiplying. For the king ſaide, Behold, the people of the children of Iſrael are greater and mightier than we: come, let vs worke wiſelie with them, leſt they multiply. Where wée ſée, that Gods fauour beſtowed in mercy, where hée liketh, is ſtill an eye-ſore to euill men, matter inough for them to grinde and grate their téeth at, and to cauſe them to enter into plots and conſpiracies againſt them. The eye of enuie looketh euer vpward: who is aboue, who riſeth, who proſpereth, who is well ſpoken of, well thought of, or any way fauoured by the Lord? and as much grieued is a ſpitefull ſpirit at the good of an other, as at the harme of himſelfe. Which Diogenes noted, when hée ſaw a knowne enuious man looke ſadde. No man, ſaith hée, can now tell, whether harme hath happened to this fellow, or good to his neighbour, for both alike vexe him. It was the blot of Athens, that renowned Citie, to haue few of any excellent vertue eſcape the rage of enuie in it, but that either they were diſgraced, or baniſhed, or put to death in the end. Thoſe whom no ſword of hating foe could daunt in the field, enuie vanquiſhed at home in the Citie, deprauing their ſeruices, blotting their names, and breaking at laſt their guiltleſſe hearts. Which made the Philoſopher preſcribe this remedie againſt enuie, whē one aſked him how he might auoide it: Euen, neither to do, nor ſay any good thing. Thus did enuie rage againſt their multiplying héere. And, if Gods actions eſcape not mans malice, ſhall yours? ſhall mine? ſhall any mans? no, no: praemoniti praemuniti, forewarned forearmed, the ſtreame ran euer ſo, and God make vs euer patient and ſtrong to go on in our duties.
                     A ſecond cauſe of this affliction is, a ſuſpicious feare which Cauſeleſſe ſuſpition. entreth into theſe Egyptians, that, if there ſhould be warre, the

Iſraelites would ioyne themſelues to the enemie, fight againſt them, and ſo get themſelues out of the land. Such fruite groweth vpon ſuch trées, miſdéeming thoughts, cauſeleſſe iealouſie, ver. 20. vaine feares, and all vniuſt opinions. Why? ſurely becauſe it is the courſe that God hath in his word threatned to wicked perſons, which feare not him as they ought to doe. Aſtoniſhment Deu. 28. ve. 28. ver 65. 66. Pſa. 14. ver. 5. of heart, a trembling heart, feare both night and day, &amp;c. reade the ſcriptures, and you ſhall finde much proofe of what I ſay. Suſpect bewrayes our thoughts, betrayes our words, ſuſpicious eies are meſſengers of woe. Well fares that man, howſoeuer his meate doth taſt, that tables not with foule ſuſpition. Better to die then to be ſuſpitious. Truſt not too ſoone, nor yet too ſoone miſtruſt, for miſtruſt will treaſon in the truſtieſt raiſe. The heart being once infect with iealouſie, the night is griefe, the day is miſerie. Jealouſie is the torment of the minde, for which no wit or counſell helpe can finde. Suſpition wounds, and iealouſie ſtriketh dead. Cauſeleſſe and vndeſerued ſuſpition ſendeth manie an one too ſwiftlie to their end. Theſe ſayings of wiſe and true experience ſhould much moue euery wiſe perſon. We ſée what we nurſe, when wee nouriſh this vice. And if all this ſhould not moue vs, yet let our owne credite moue vs, which by this meanes is ſhrewdly drawne in queſtion, the knowne verſés ſaying thus:
                     
                        Too much ſuſpition of another is
                        A flat condemning of thine owne amiſſe.
                     
                     A third cauſe of their affliction was a new King ſhe former being dead, vnder whom they felt no ſuch miſerie. Which may Change of Prince. iuſtlie occaſion vs to note carefullie what danger often is in change of Gouernours, if the Lord be not mercifull. Salomon may haue his wants, but when his ſonne commeth in his place he thundreth, and telleth the people that his little finger ſhall be heauier vpon them, than all his fathers hand. This might we as déepelie haue taſted of, as euer did theſe Iſraelites, if God almightie had not thought vpon mercie in ſtead of iudgement. The great neglect of thoſe gracious daies, which vnder the bleſſed gouernment of Quéene Elizabeth, our late renowned ſouereigne wee comfortablie enioyed, deſerued puniſhment in a high degrée, we muſt néedes confeſſe, if we will ſay truth: yet in ſteade thereof, our moſt ſwéete God, whoſe goodnes knoweth

neither bottome nor meaſure, hath raiſed vp ouer vs ſuch a King againe, as both ſo firmelie is faſtned to the loue of the Goſpell, and ſo enriched with all other princelie vertues either of nature or grace, as not onelie we with bowed knées may euer praiſe the name of God, but all forreigne Nations ſpeake and write of ſo admirable mercie vouchſafed vnto vs; God for his Chriſtes ſake make vs thankfull. That the King knewe not Ioſeph, Diuines ſay, it was either for want of reading the Hiſtories, or becauſe vnthankfullie hee contemned the good that was done in other times, and to other men. S. Auguſtine héere giueth a note, how men may know what King ruleth within Aug. Serm. 34. de tempore. them, to whoſe words I refer the reader.
                     And let this forgetting of Ioſeph, that is, of the ſeruice and good that Ioſeph did to all that land of Egipt, in the great famine mentioned in Geneſis, be the fourth and laſt cauſe of this affliction. And this indéede, if you marke it, is a mother of great miſchiefe whereſoeuer it is, euen this forgetting of ſuch benefites as we ought, neuer to forget. This maketh the child vndutifull to his parents, becauſe hee forgetteth what they haue done for him: which made the olde father Tobiah call vpon his ſonne earneſtlie to remember what his mother ſuffered for him when he was in her bodie, what care after when he was brought into the world, to make much of her as long as ſhe liued, &amp; when ſhe ſhould die to burie her by him. The good father doubted not but due remembrance would work gratitude, as he well knew vnkind forgetfulnes would do ye contrarie. This is the ſinne of ſeruants to their Maiſters, &amp; of Maiſters often to their ſeruants. Of one neighbour towards another, &amp; of all the world almoſt this day. But could ſuch ſeruice, may you thinke, as Ioſeph did to Egipt be euer forgotten? yea, yea, we ſée it héere noted by God himſelfe: and therefore we muſt know it for truth, that ingratitude will make no bones to ſwallow vp any vertue, any merit, any goodnes whatſoeuer. Which cauſeth a ſaying to be moſt true, Si ingratum dixeris, omnia dixeris: if thou canſt truly ſay he is vnthankfull, in that one word thou haſt ſaide all the euill of him that may be ſpoken. Honourable therefore was it and thrice honourable in King Henry the 3. King of this land, ſo to remember the ſeruices of his oppreſſed ſeruant Hubert Lord chiefe Juſtice of England, &amp; thereupon to frée him from

the malice of his enemies, and to ſaue his life.
                     I ſée no reaſon (ſaith he) why we ſhould deale ſo hardly with Hubert (when his enemies vrged his execution, and expected the Kings cōmandement for the ſame,) for firſt, from the time of his youth he ſerued mine Uncle, King Richard, &amp; then my father, King Iohn: in whoſe ſeruice, as I heard ſay, beyond the ſeas he was driuen to eate his horſe, and in my time he hath ſtoode conſtantly in the defence of yt Realme againſt forreigne Nations, kept the Caſtle of Douer againſt king Lewis, and vanquiſhed the French-men vpon the ſeas, alſo at Bedford and Lincolne he hath done great ſeruice. If hee ſhould be guiltie of anie thing done vntruly againſt me, which is not euidentlie proued, yet by me he ſhall neuer be put to ſuch a villanous death. For I had rather be accounted a king fooliſh and ſimple, than to be iudged a tyrant and ſéeker of blood, eſpeciallie of ſuch, as haue ſerued me and my Aunceſtors in manie perils ſo dangerouſly, weighing more the few euils which yet be not proued, than ſo many good deſerts both to me and the whole Realme, euidently knowne vnto all men. As then remembrance and forgetfulnes of a good are contrarie, ſo you ſée the effects of them are contrarie: the one bringing forth all honourable actions, the other oppreſſion and crueltie, as in this place. Theſe were the foure cauſes of this great affliction of Gods people, and let vs neuer forget them, nor their vſe.
                     3. In the next place let vs note their manner in bringing their purpoſe to paſſe: firſt, they haue a méeting and a conſultation, How the wicked vſe to worke. then an exeeution of what they haue deuiſed. Their méeting the king cauſed, when he ſaid, Come, let vs work wiſelie, &amp;c. In which wee ſée the guiſe of the world, the wicked haue a Come as well as the godlie, but farre and farre differing: for the godlie haue their Come as a word of encouragement to religion, and the exerciſes thereof, as when they ſay: O come and let vs ſing vnto the Lord, let vs hartily reioyce in the ſtrength of his ſaluation. But the wickeds Come, is to conſpiracie and practiſe: in which they are more diligent, than the children of light are in their good: for their bodies méete, their heads méete, their hearts méete, &amp; both outward &amp; inward they are earneſt in euill. Such a Come we reade of againſt holie Ieremie: Come, ſayd the wicked, and let vs imagine a deuiſe

againſt Ieremie, let vs ſmite him with the tongue, and not giue credite to any of his words. Such another haue Kuffians and Ier. 18. théenes and ſwaggering fellowes in the booke of the Prouerbs: Come and caſt in thy lot with ours, for we will haue all but one 
                        Prou. 1. 
                        purſe, &amp;c. Such another hath the harlot to the young man, Come, my husband is not at home, &amp;c. But againſt ſuch curſed Prou. 7. 
                        Comes, let vs euer remember what the Pſalme ſaith, Bleſſed 
                        Pſal. 1. ver. 1. 
                        is the man that hath not walked in the counſell of the vngodly, nor ſtand in the way of ſinners, and hath not ſit in the ſeate of the ſcornfull. And that Arnobius an olde Writer well noteth vpon thoſe words. Primus pſalmus vnde ſcit beatitudinem perijſſe, inde recuperat. In conſilio impiorum abijt Adam, id eſt, in ſerpentis et mulieris. Et nunc Adam noster, id eſt, conſenſus noſter, beatus erit, ſi non abierit in conſilio ſerpentis et mulieris, id eſt, inconſilio carnis et diaboli, aut ſi abierit, non ibi ſtet, aut ſi ſteterit, non ſedeat, &amp;c. The firſt Pſalme, ſaith he, where it knew happines was loſt, there beginneth to recouer it againe: for Adam walked in the counſell of the wicked, namely, of the woman and of the ſerpent. And now our Adam, that is, our conſent, ſhall be bleſſed, if it doo not walke in the counſell of the woman and of the ſerpent, that is, of fleſh and the deuill, or if it happen to walk, yet ſtandeth not ſtill, or if it ſtand ſtill, yet ſitteth not downe in the ſame, that is, abideth not and tarieth in it, but remembring the law of the Lord, taketh his delight therein, and in the ſame doth exerciſe himſelfe both day and night. This curſed conuenticle and malicious méeting, albeit wholely it ſauoreth of crueltie and blood, yet, if you marke it, it is couered and ſmeared ouer with a vizard and die of wiſedome: for Come, faith the King, let vs wiſely worke. So ſtill is the Deuill like himſelfe, if you marke it, and euer in his colours. His followers learne of him, and they alſo delight in colours. The proud man is cleanlie, the couetous man is prouident, the drunkard a good-fellow, and ſuch like. But the day will come wherein all ſuch colours will be waſhed away: and the cleare ſunne breaking out, and diſpierſing all clouds, ſinne will be diſcerned to be ſinne, and eternally punniſhed. Thus of their méeting and their counſell.
                     4 The concluſion &amp; reſolution of their counſel, if you marke The wicked lay burthens on the godly. the text, is to lay burthens vpon this people, and to kéepe them

downe. Burthens of labours, as appeareth, and burthens of payments, as ſome write. So that by this way their ſtrength ſhould be ſhaken, and their liues made weariſome vnto them, that thereby leſſe encreaſing might be amongſt them, and leſſe feare had of them. Where marke if you doe not ſée the deuiſes of ſome in our daies, wiſe, as they thinke, but héerein wicked, as we know, ſéeking by ſuch practiſes to breake both backs and hearts of thoſe that deſerue better then themſelues, as if they had béene Egiptians borne, and not Chriſtians acquainted with the booke of God. Whom I make no doubt (if they hold on their way) but the Red-ſea will deuoure, as it did theſe, that is, the Juſtice of God will deſtroy them for their ſinne. Till then patience, and a continuall comfortable remembrance that God ſitteth at the ſtearne, which ſurely is enough to any that knoweth how ſwéete he is to all that faſt and faithfully cleaue vnto him.
                     5 What is the euent? to kéepe them vnder is the plot, but will it hold? O comfort! O comfort I ſay againe! No, no, their Wicked deuiſes againſt the godly faile of effect when God will. deuiſe will not hold, for the Lord ſitting in the heauens, laughed all their counſels to ſcorne, And the more they vexed them, the more they multiplied and grew, ſaith the text. A thing neuer to be thought of enough. So hath it béene, ſo ſhall it be to the worlds end, with all faithfull ſeruants of God as ſhall be fit. In thoſe bloodie perſecutions after Chriſtes death by the Romaine Emperours, what ſtrange torments were deuiſed to kéepe downe religion and religious profeſſours, men and women? They plucked off their ſkinnes quicke, they boared out their eies with wimbles, they broiled them aliue on Grid
                        
                           •
                        rons, they ſcalded them in boiling liquors, they encloſed them in barrels, and driuing great nailes through, tumbled them downe mountaines, till their owne blood ſo cruellie drawne out ſtifled and choaked them in the barrell, womens breaſts were ſeared off with burning irons, their bodies rent, and their ioynts racked with many and many gréeuous paines. But would all this ſerue? no, no, euen as héere, ſo then the more they were vexed, the more they multiplied through the mercie and power of him that gaue them ſtrength to endure the paine, and to ſcorne the malice. So that S. Auguſtine ſaith of thoſe times: Ligabantur, vrebantur, cadebantur et tamen multiplicabantur,
                        
they were bound, they were burned, they were beaten, &amp;c. and yet they multiplied. The bloud of Martyrs is the ſéede of the church, and bringeth forth fruite as ſéede dooth, ſome thirtie, ſome ſixtie, and ſome a hundred fold, as God pleaſeth. His arme ſhortneth not at any time, wée all know, and therefore what hée will ſuffer the deuill and his inſtruments to doe, that they can, and no more. They haue worne the crowns of Kingdomes at laſt, to the ioy of thouſand thouſands, in deſpite of all malice, who were thruſt ſore, at that they might fall, and from an honourable riſing could not the malice of all Ioſephs brethren kéepe him. Therefore ſaith the text, they were ver. 12. the more grieued againſt the children of Iſrael. And ſo vſuallie falleth out to thoſe that ſéeke their ſecuritie by wicked wayes. God croſſeth, and their deuiſes turne to their owne further woe and diſcontentment, according to the common prouerbe, Malum conſilium conſultori peſſimum, euill counſell is alwaies worſe to him that giueth it.
                     6 Will they then giue ouer their wicked waies and ſuffer The wicked are obſtinate in euill. them to increaſe, whom God will haue to increaſe? No, but they adde vnto their crueltie more and more: in ſuch ſort as the Iſraelites are weary of their liues, by ſore labour in clay and bricke, and in all worke in the field, with all manner of bondage, ver. 14. which they laide vpon them moſt cruelly, &amp; that their iniquity might bée full, they deuiſe a crueltie neuer heard of before, to ſend for the Midwiues and to deale with them to deſtroy the male-children of ye Iſraelites at ye birth. Which may rightly ver. 15. teach vs to beware euer how wée begin to do euill, for feare one euill pull on another as héere it did; and in Dauid againe, when adultery drew on murder of an innocent man, and a faithfull ſubiect. But did the Midwiues obey his commandement? No, they feare God, ſaith the text, and did not as the king commanded them, but preſerued aliue the men-children, iuſtly commended for that they rather obeyed God, than man. They conſidered what ſtoode with the law of God, which to them was Act. 5. knowne, and not what pleaſed a miſ-led minde of a gouernour. Kings are to bée obeied and pleaſed, but in the Lord. And if further they will force vs, our bodies are theirs to ſuſtaine vndeſerued paine, but both bodie and ſoule ſhall die, if wee ſinne againſt God. This did thoſe happie men know and followe,

when they were threatned, and at laſt thruſt into that fierie fornace by great crueltie, ſaying, as you reade there; Our God is able to deliuer vs, if it pleaſe him, but if not, yet know, O King, that wée will not doe this thing béeing wicked idolatry to worſhip the moulten image. The reaſon of the Midwiues refuſall is alledged, the feare of God. And ſurelie whereſoeuer this banke is, the waters of vngodlineſſe are held out from euerflowing, as where the banke is not, they doe. When Abraham once entertained the thought, that in the king of Gerar his courte, the feare of God was not, ſtreight hée doubted violence both to himſelfe, and to his wife: and ſo offended in ſaying ſhe was his ſiſter. This feare made Ioſeph that he durſt not ſinne againſt his maiſter or againſt his brethren when his father was dead. This feare is the beginning of wiſedome, and a good vnderſtanding haue all they that doe thereafter, the praiſe of it endureth for euer. Still then labour to kéepe this feare in your heart, and you 
                           •
                        hall reape a comfortable reward of it at the laſt.
                     7. What then became of the Midwiues? how eſcaped they How the Midwiues eſcaped the kings wrath. the Kings wrath, diſobeying his commaundement? Surely the text ſaith, the King ſent for them, and they by an vntruth excuſed themſelues, ſaying: The Hebrewe women were ſo ſtrong, that they were deliuered before anie midwife came. Where, in the King, we may learne this good, not to condemne anie before we heare them: for, if ſo wicked a man as this King was, had yet that iuſtice, to ſend for them and to heare their defence, much more ſhould wee that knowe more, doe the like. Manie ſwelling tales and ſtrange reports haue féeble proofe, when hearing is graunted. Secondlie, in the Midwiues we may ſée the weakenes of our natures, for they ſhould not haue lyed for anie feare: and therefore though a good déede be done, yet it is ill defended. Wee may not lie, ſaith the ſcripture, to iuſtifie God, much leſſe for anie other cauſe. This weakenes then in theſe good women was like a ſpot in a faire face: and S. Auguſtine ſaith of them, Viues conſeruare natos fuit miſerecordiae, at pro vita ſua mentit as eſſe, opus fuit infirmitatis, quam Deus gratia condonat. Homines veró non niſi ingrati et proterui poſſunt adexemplum imitationis ſibi proponere. To preſerue aliue the children, was a worke of mercie, but to lie for the ſafetie of their liues, was a

worke of infirmitie, which yet God pardoned by grace, and none, ſauing vnthankfull and crooked perſons, will euer propoſe it to themſelues to be imitated.
                     8. But the text ſaith, God proſpered the midwiues, and built them houſes: what is that? Domus nomine in ſcripturis, non ſolum habitationis locus, ſed et filij quibus, tanquam lapidibus, domus ſeu familia 
                        How God built houſes for the Midwiues. 
                        conſtruitur &amp; creſcit, &amp; resetiam familiaris intelligi poſſunt: vnde quidam copioſam ſobolem eis dediſſe affirmant, vt Euſeb: &amp; Hugo de Sto. victore. Hyeron: innuit aedificaſſe eis spirituales domus. Thom. quód conuerſae fuerunt ad cultum veri dei. Euſeb. Caeſarien: aedificaſſe domus non manu factas, ſed in coelis ſitas &amp;c. The meaning vſually receaued is, hée bleſſed their families, that they became of great reputation, which were deſcended of them. And hée ſtirred vp the hearts of the Iſraelites to build them houſes which deſcended to their families, and were fit for them. By the phraſe then of ſpéech let vs learne thus much, euer to lift vp our eies to God for any thing that happeneth to vs, albeit man be the meanes which hée vſeth, for euer it is the Lords worke. Such a phraſe was that in Geneſis, God made them aprons or coates of ſkins, when themſelues were the workers, and God the author of the deuiſe. Did wée thus ſée God in all wée enioie, it could not be, but thankful thoughts would ariſe in our harts, and more care to pleaſe him than appeareth now in many an one. Proſecute this meditation with your ſelfe, and thinke of your owne particular, what God hath donefor you, and what you render to him againe, &amp;c.
                     I will caſt my heart vpon another thing, mée thinke, héere Note this well moſt comfortable, namelie, how God reiected not the good that was in theſe women for the imperfection that was mingled with it, but pardoning what was weake, gratiouſly rewardeth what was well. Feare not you then though all bée not in you as you wiſh, but pray as you can, reade as you can, heare as you can, and all other Chriſtian duties doe them as you can, according to that meaſure of grace which you haue receiued: and, if any infirmity thruſt it ſelfe in, and trouble you, when you are moſt deſirous to bée frée from it, feare not: the Lord ſheweth in theſe women what his nature is. He knoweth our mould whereof we be made, and he turneth away his face from beholding our fraileties, caſting a grations countenance vpon

our good. Frailtie is ours, our weldooing is his: and his own grace he wil reward. You are not greater than ye Apoſtle was who yet groaned (you know) vnder this burden, that he could Rom. 7. not doe the good which hée would, but ſtill ſlipt into the euil which he would not. Tyrannize not then ouer your ſelfe, but know it for a truth, that want to doe all, diſgraceth not a will to doe ſome thing with a ſwéete God. Often remember that place in the Kings, ſo ful of comfort. He onlie (ſaith the Lord) ſhall goe to the graue in peace, becauſe in him there is ſome goodneſſe. 
                        1. King. 14. 13. 
                        Some goodneſſe, I ſay againe, and euer haue you it in your remembrance: for not, ſome goodneſſe, ſhal looſe his rewarde with God, though all bée not there. Your will would doe better, and that hée ſéeth, but you faile as a child of Adam, and that hée ſéeth alſo, yet will not ſée it, to ſtop any mercie from your, ſome goodneſſe. Ifhée then bée ſo ſwéete, bée not you ſower againſt your ſelfe, but chéerefully doing what you can, ſay for your wants with him in the Goſpell which felt infirmity as you doe: Lord, helpe my vnbeleefe: Lord, helpe my weaknes euery way, for thy mercy ſake.
                     9 Laſtly, when the King ſaw hée could not haue his will that way, then hée commaunded that euery man-childe ſhould bée caſt into the riuer as ſoone as it was borne, and of like appointed bloodie ſearchers for that purpoſe. So, when craft can When craft cannot, fury &amp; force muſt. not, rage muſt, increaſing their malice againſt the Lord and his poore members, neuer thinking how hard it is to kicke againſt the pricke. Such a like bloody attempt made Herod, when hée flew the children, but yet miſſed of his purpoſe, as did héere this King. Let his power to preuent his foes, bée the comfort of all his true ſeruants euer. Thus may we profit by this chapter.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. 2.
                     
                        
                           In this chapter conſider chiefely theſe three heads.
                           
                              The birth of Moſes and his bringing vp.
                              His flying away from Egypt.
                              His mariage.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        1. TOuching the birth of Moſes, it is noted, that both by father and mother he It is a ſtrange kindred that hath none euill ofit. was of the tribe of Leui: and what Leui, the ſonne of Iacob, did, we reade in Geneſis 34. 25. verſe. The blemiſh whereof claue vnto his poſteritie after: yet now you ſée, God honoureth it with this great honour, that of that Tribe ſhould come this famous Deliuerer of the whole Nation from ſuch cruell bondage as now they endured. An honour ſurelie verie great, and we may well note in it the ſwéete goodnes of Almightie God, who, though ſome of a Tribe haue offended him, and left cleauing to their name that blacknes and blot which the reſt of their name neuer occaſioned, yet is not for euer alienated thereby from the whole blood, but extendeth mercie and fauour, yea verie high honour to ſome of them as hee ſhall thinke good, wiping out by degrées what foule ſinne had wiped on too wickedlie. How may men pray then in comfort euer? O Lord, O Lord, remember not the offences of them that haue gone before vs, but let mercie reach, notwithſtanding their euill, to thoſe that hartilie defied their euill. This example of God, both good Princes and all good Chriſtians carefullie follow, not hurting one for another, when like deſeruing

maketh them not in like ſort puniſhable. Neuertheleſſe, ſome there be, that, forgetting it, maintaine by an euill name of deadlie feud, as they call it, a damnable reuenge vpon manie, and for many yéeres, againſt which is the forme of prayer taught vs by Chriſt, forgiue vs our treſpaſſes, as we forgiue them that treſpaſſe againſt vs, with many ſcriptures more.
                        2. It is ſaid, his mother hid him thrée moneths, and Origen maketh this vſe of it, that men be carefull not to doe all things A moſt wofull eſtate of the Church. to be ſéene of men, but as the ſcripture teacheth, to ſhut the dore and to pray in ſecret, not to let the left hand knowe what the right hand doth: for feare, leaſt, if theſe male-children be expoſed to the view of men, with a longing deſire to win praiſe, the Egiptians catch them and caſt them into the riuer. But rather thinke you by theſe words of the wofull eſtate wherein this people of God then liued. What fulnes of furie was this, ſo bloodilie to tyrannize ouer new borne Infants, were they neuer ſo ſwéete and well fauoured, that their parents muſt hide them, if they would enioy them but a day? O bittertimes! O wofull mothers, when they ſaw themſelues once conceiued with child! for if it were a man-child, their eies muſt ſee the murderers take it, and though it wept vpon father and mother, and lifted vp both little hands and eies in the pittifulleſt manner that it could, therby deſiring to be ſaued from the deſtroyer, yet could they not help, it muſt away to the riuer, to the riuer, it muſt be drowned without all remorſe and pitie. Let it worke in our hard hearts ſome true féeling of our happie fréedome from ſuch miſerie, and earneſt prayer to the God of mercie, that euer he would continue freedome vnto vs.
                        3. It is ſaid alſo the child was faire. What God had appointed him for, you knowe: and now ſée, how the Lord gaue, what with men might giue him more grace. Uertue in a faire bodie is more acceptable. And often in children appeareth ſome ſigne Valer. Max. lib. 3. cap. 1. of future vertue, wherewith God purpoſeth to endue them when they are men. Beautie and comlineſſe either in men or women is the gift of God, but a greater gift it is to haue grace withall to liue vertuouſlie. Sarai, Rebecca, Rachel, among women were verie faire and moſt vertuous withall. Salomon ſpeaketh of others beautifull alſo, but not good. Prou. 6. 27. Prou. 11. 22. Ioſeph, Saul, Abſolon, among men were goodly perſonages,

but Ioſephs pietie was more glorious, than all his beautie. Thanke GOD for his mercie in your ſelfe and your children: and, to ſupplie all defects, beſéech him in your prayer: you ſhall finde the comfort and the benefit of it. If fauour be but hard, remember S. Bernard: It is a happie blacknes Foelix nigredo, quae mentis candorem habet. in bodie, which is accompanied with a whiteneſſe in minde. Many haue béene hard fauoured, and yet endued with excellent parts. Philopaemen, a Grecian Captaine Do poenas deformitatis meae. Plutarch in rita. verie deformed, excelled moſt men in Militarie matters. Acſope, very hard fauored, yet moſt wittie. Socrates, full of imperfections in ſhape, and yet who more famous for wiſedome? Apollo his oracle gaue him preheminence. Thus might I tell you manie Stories: but you ſée the Meditation ſufficientlie, followe it further, as you ſée cauſe. Bleſſed be God, that euery way giueth vs comfort. Xerxes, 
                           Heredotus. lib. 7. that had that huge armie, yet is ſaid to haue béene the goodlieſt man of them all. Plutarch, in the life of Demetrius ſaith, hee was ſo paſſing in face and countenance, that no Painter or Picture-maker was able to drawe him. Of Scipio Africanus, he ſaith, that the Barbarians in Spaine ſtoode amazed at his comlineſſe. Suetonius writeth of the goodlie Eie of Auguſtus Caeſar. What an excellent perſonage Charles the great had, Paulus Aemilius ſheweth in his third booke. Maximilian the firſt had ſuch a Preſence &amp; Maieſtie, that a ſtranger is ſaid, among 30. great Princes, to have noted him out, hauing neuer ſéene him before. But I forget my ſelfe, out of a deſire to giue you occaſion to thinke of more.
                        4. But was onlie the faireneſſe of the childe, that made the mother hide him? No, euerie creature thinketh his owne, faire. This therefore is ſomewhat, but not all, Nature had a ſway: and yet, aboue all, Gods Spirit telleth vs of another thing, which wee muſt marke, namely, of faith. For, by faith, ſaith he, by the Apoſtle to the Hebrewes, Moſes, 
                           Heb. 11. 23. when he was borne, was hid thrée moneths by his parents, becauſe they ſawe hee was a proper childe, neither

feared they the Kings commaundement. Faith beléeued that God would one day releaſe them, and not any longer ſuffer them ſo cruellie to be oppreſſed. In hope therefore of the ſame, they vſed meanes, hiding him, as they could, and leauing the ſucceſſe to God. Their eies could not ſée any way of ſafetie, much leſſe that way, which after fell out: but their hearts hoped, their ſoules prayed, and vpon him they fixed both heart and ſoule, who is Almightie, Allmercifull, All-ſwéete and kinde: to his diſtreſſed ſeruants then néereſt, when he ſéemeth furtheſt; then ſtrongeſt, when hee ſéemeth weakeſt; then ſwéeteſt, when hee ſeemeth lowreſt; and then vp in wrath to reuenge our wrongs, when the world doth thinke hee hath forgotten vs. Such faith then let vs marke, and pray for, in the euill day: doubt not the Lord, diſtruſt not his helpe, ſhift along in his holy feare with ſuch lawfull meanes, as you poſſiblie can: commend the bleſſing of them to him, and let him euer doe his owne will.
                        5. But (alas) ſhe could not long keepe him thus. Three moneths ſhe did it by ſecret hiding: but then, ſaith the Storie, ſhe could no longer: ſo cruell were their hearts, and ſo narrowe was the ſearch, that hee muſt away, a caſe more than bitter, as hath beene ſaide. But what helpe now for this guiltleſſe babe? See an excellent woman, An excellent woman. full of faith in her God: when ſhe could no longer hide him, ſhe deuiſed for him a little arke made of réede, and dawbed it with 
                              〈◊〉
                            and pitch, putting the childe in it, and ſetting it among the bulruſhes by the riuer ſide, appointing her daughter (the childs ſiſter) to watch the ſame: ſo committing that thing to her mightie God, which her ſelfe could not keepe from a bloodie tyrant, neuer yeelding, but in hope ſtill, euen as it were paſt hope, depended faithfullie and conſtantly vpon her God for the ſafetie of her child.
                        6. And what did the father all this while, that the ſcripture ſtill mentioneth the mother, ſaying, ſhee did, and ſhee did? Trulie of like all vexed, amazed, and tormented with

ſhe woe of it, ſtoode as a man ſhiftleſſe, not ſéeing what to doe. The woman enabled by God, is the better man, quicker and prompter for deuiſe in ſo touching an extremitie: Womens wits haue often great effects in extremitie. ſhee deuiſeth what hee liketh, and ſhee performeth what God bleſſeth. In the weaker veſſell Gods ſtrength was more ſéene, and hee doth enable them now and then for that purpoſe. The knowledge of it muſt yéeld them a fit regard, and men may not euer diſdaine to followe them, by whom they ſée God ſometimes doth worke. Manie men haue béene well aduiſed by their wiues; and the womans counſell not followed, you reade in Scripture, hath turned ſometimes to the mans woe. You remember the particular, Haue not thou to doe with that iuſtman, with diuers others.
                        7. The childe thus placed by the water ſide, and his ſiſter watching a farre off, as though ſhe knewe not of it, to ſée what would become of her little brother, what falleth out? O depth of Gods mercie and goodnes! downe commeth that way, to waſh her ſelfe in ye riuer, Pharaohs daughter, euen this cruell Pharaohs daughter, called of ſome Thermutis, &amp; walking by the riuer ſide with her maydes, ſpies the arke among the bul-ruſhes, and ſent her mayde to fetch it: when ſhee opened it, behold little Moſes in it, and the poore babe wept vpon her, begging by teares (as well as it could) ſome mercie and pittie againſt the bloodie lawe of her father. Shée had compaſſion, and conceaued rightlie, that it was one of the Hebrewes children. By all which, what may we learne, but firſt, that there is no rocke more ſure, nor refuge more comfortable (when mans power faileth) than Gods gracious prouidence? (for there is no temptation ſo great, whereunto that cannot giue an iſſue.) Secondly, how able God is, to diſpoſe of men and womens courſes, otherwiſe, than at the beginning they entended? (for this Ladie purpoſed onelie to walke and waſh her, but God had a worke of mercie to doe by her; her purpoſe was one thing, and the Lords was another.) Often thus 
                              〈2 pages missing〉
                           
                           
Trulie, ſo often as any man or woman heare their owne name, they are accuſed of theſe things, if they be guiltie. A promiſe ſo broken, being made to God in the face of the congregation, will trouble the ſoule ſore at the houre of death.
                        11. Finally, wée ſée plainely by this whole diſcourſe, how mans counſell can not hinder that, which God hath determined ſhall come to paſſe. For there is no counſell, no wiſdome, no ſtrength againſt the Lord. Moſes muſt liue, and become a Deliuerer to that people, doo Pharaoh what he can. And though many poore infants were caſt away to preuent his feare, yet that Infant which muſt effect what he ſo feared, is preſerued aliue in deſpight of him, yea nouriſhed vp by his owne daughter, in his owne boſome, to the wonder of all that reade it, to the worlds end. The like you may remewber of Herod and thoſe infants; but this is inough of the firſt part of this chapter.
                     
                     
                        The ſecond part.
                        1. NOw followeth the ſecond part; namelie, of his departure both from Court and Country, which happened when hée was forty yéeres olde, as Stephen 
                           Act 7. 23. witneſſeth. And, if any maruell, why it was ſo long? of all the reaſons that are alledged, it ſéemeth beſt, that, till that time, hée had not his Calling from God to beginne that worke. Hée might conſider his owne birth and parentage, his great preſeruation and education, his Nations miſery and bondage, and heartilie pittie them; but, that he was of God appointed to them a Deliuerer, he knew not, till God reuealed it, and God reuealed it not, till now, as it ſhould ſéeme; for Stephen ſaith, it came into his minde, when he was thus olde, to viſite his brethren; as if hee ſhould ſay, hée now felt his calling and not before.
                        2. When he did feele it, and that once the Spirit of God ſmote his hart, then marke we, how no honours, no

pleaſures, no riches could kéepe him in the Court any longer, but he rather choſe to ſuffer aduerſitie with the people of God, than to inioy the pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon, Heb. 11. 25. eſteeming the rebukes of Chriſt greater riches, than the treaſures of Egypt. For he had reſpect vnto the recompence of the reward. A notable example for all Courtiers and men of high place, that they ſuffer themſelues not to be ſnared wt any thing incident to their places ſo, that they may not ſerue ye liuing God as they ought. For ſurely, if either pleaſure or profit draw frō him, it is too dearely bought, Courtiers and great perſonages. &amp; wil lie heauie vpō their ſoules one day. Their diſſembling there, can neuer profit Gods people, as their open profeſſion would doe. But, in ſteade of profiting, it draweth many thouſands to death with them, who obſerue their ſteppes, and depend vpon them: which will bée laide to their charge in that great daie of the Lord, when Moſes ſhall liue, and they die: Not all the glory they poſſeſſed in this world béeing able to procure them one droppe of water to coole their tougues.
                        3. When hee came to his brethren, he ſaw their bitter ſeruitude, burdens and ſlauery out of meaſure: hée ſaw many great abuſes offered vnto them, wherewith hée was ſo farre mooued, that he laide his hands vpon one of the Egyptians, and ſiue him. Not ſo teaching priuate men to doe without authoritie, what he did, warranted by a Calling: but rightly teaching Magiſtrates, which haue calling to vſe their Places to the reliefe of the oppreſſed, &amp; inſtrucing all men as their Places will warrant them, to helpe their brethren from iuſt oppreſſors.
                        4. But his looking about him on euery ſide, when he did it, and hiding him that was ſlaine, argue, as you may thinke, an euill conſcience, and prooue in him an vnlawfull act. No indéede, no more than it dooth in other Magiſtrates, that they execute iuſtice vpon some earely, or late, or priuately, to auoide ſedition and tumult. This was in Moſes, and in them, a godlie wiſedome, prouiding warely, that

whiles they endeauour a good, by ſome indiſcréet handling, there grow not an euill. Some feare, if you will, I deny not to haue béene in Moſes, when hée did it: &amp; it may truly teach vs the weakeneſſe that ſometimes is in the beſt ſeruants of God, in the very warranted works of their lawful calling, to our comfort, if wée féele the like. And, which is ſwéete alſo, that God dooth not 
                              •
                           aſt away obedience performed to him with ſome feare more than it ſhould. Wée are not greater than Moſes: and therefore, (praying for ſtrength, and dooing our beſt, if ſome vnwiſhed weakeneſſe ſhew it ſelfe) let this example bée remembred.
                        5. It is ſaide in the text, that Moſes came forth againe the ſecond daie: and thereby all Magiſtrates may learne conſtancie and continuance in their care for their people. For it is not inough one day to come and ſée how all goeth, as at their firſt entrance vpō their Office, or otherwiſe; but euen the ſecond day they ſhould doo the ſame, and ſo day by day, as occaſion ſerueth, during the time of their Charge. The want whereof maketh many a one wring, that by more diligence would bée righted and relieued.
                        6. But how was he requited? Surely finding two ſtriuing together, and admoniſhing them to ceaſe from ſuch vnbrotherly ſtrife, ſtreight hee was reproached by one of them, in this ſort: Who made thee a man of authoritie, &amp; a Iudge ouer vs? Thinkeſt thou to kill me, as thou killedſt the Egyptian? A cléere glaſſe for all eies to ſée in, the reward often giuen to good men, when they haue performed ſome good duties to their brethren. But it may be no diſcouragement: for GOD is in heauen, and will reward all obedience to him, paying home heauily ſuch vnthankefull receiuers of it.
                        7. Was this all? no, marke more in theſe vnkinde Iſraelites. The death of the Egyptian is brought to Pharaohs care: ſo that now Moſes, for his zeale and heart to Solent reges abundare auribus. Xenophon. relieue his country-man that was abuſed, muſt either himſelfe fall into danger, or flie the country to his diſgrace.

Not onelie therefore the vnthankefulneſſe, but the meaſure of it is to bée obſerued, for our good. For many times wée can diſgeſt ſome ingratitude, but ſuch a meaſure and ſuch a manner, as is happily offered vnto vs, wée caunot. This example will helpe vs: for ſure the meaſure héere was great, and the manner odious. Againe, for whiblers and pratling pick-thanks, tatlers, and tale-tellars, there may bée a Note of them. You ſée what an auncient wéede in the world they bée: they were neuer wanting, nor will bee, while ye world indureth: neither Princes, nor meaner than Princes can auoide them: there is no newes ſtirring, but they are carriers of it, and they can greatlie iucreaſe it in the carriage. No circumſtances can make them ſilent. Many good men haue ſmarted by them: and now Moſes, yon sée, taſteth of them. Who is hée or ſhée, that haue not ſome way by theſe walking tongues béen wounded? I leaue you to your owne experience of this venome.
                        8. Whither flyeth Moſes then, from this raging ſtorme of Pharaohs diſpleaſure raiſed vp againſt him by theſe pratlers? Into the land of Midian, ſaith the text, where the Lord prouided for him. Then marke with your ſelfe, how alwaies one place or other the Lord hath for his ſeruants. If Iudaea be dangerous for the childe Ieſus, in Egypt he ſhal find ſafetie, til ye time appointed, &amp; ſo forth read 2. Cor. 4. 8.
                        9. Whē he was come thither, He ſate him down by a wel: a place moſt like to bring ſome to him, of whom he might inquire, how he might beſtow himſelfe. But God knoweth what thoughts the circumſtances of his caſe procured vnto him. His calling he ſaw, not acknowledged of his country-men: but in ſteade thereof his life brought in queſtion, and therefore might fall into ſome doubt of it himſelfe. All his worldly comforts were now departed from him, and he a poore exile in a ſtrange country, not knowing which waie to turne him. A great change from ſo high a place as Moſes had in Egypt, béeing eſtéemed the Sonne of Pharoahs daughter: and leſſer alterations than

this, wée well know, haue giuen good men ſhrewd plucks: yet reade wée of no diſcomfort in Moſes, which wée muſt obſerue, and be bettered by it. GOD humbleth him in his worldly eſtate, and bringeth him to this lowe ebbe: yet forſaketh him not, but déerelie loueth him, and hath great honours in ſtore for him againe, when time commeth. We are likewiſe the Lords, and wee muſt bee content, that hee doe with vs his owne good pleaſure euer.
                     
                     
                        The third part.
                        1. THe thirde part of the chapter followeth: concerning his mariage in that land, the manner wherof you may reade in your chapter, verſe. 16. &amp;c. Some blame him as matching with the vnbeléeuing, others excuſe him, ſaying, they were not vnbeléeuers. The ſcripture is ſilent, and therefore we neede not to be curious. To excuſe the godlie Fathers euer, is more than can be, to make Iethro and his houſhold ſuch beléeuers as they ought to be, with whom wée ioine in mariage. How beit happily he was better than thouſands there. Theoderet ſaith, Typus erat 
                           Is more then hath ſound proofe. 
                           Chriſti domini, qui, cum ex Iudeis ſecundum carnem natus eſſet, eccleſiam Gentium appelauit ſponſam ſuam. Moſes
                            herein was a type of Chriſt, who, béeing borne of the Jewes according to the fleſh, married himſelfe to the Gentiles and Theod. in Ex. cap. 2. ralled them his ſpouſe. But leaue we it as not profitable to vs to ſcanne what God hath pleaſed to conceale. And marke the hart of Iethro when he vnderſtood how Moſes had helped his daughters at the well, very kindly he conceiued of that fauour, and chid them for ſo leauing him, &amp; not bringing him home to eatebread. Surely the Spirit of God dooth not ſo ſtill in euery place note this kindneſſe of hart in requiting loue, but that he excéedingly liketh it, and would haue all his, euer to follow it.
                        2 Of his wife the Lord gaue him a ſonne whoſe name

he called Gerſhom, adding the reaſon, becauſe, ſaith hée, I haue bene a ſtranger in a ſtrange land. So then, that which many obiect oftentimes to Gods children by way of reproach, that they are ſtrangers, exiles, and ſo forth, that, Moſes taketh to be no reproach, and therefore giueth the title of it to his ſonne for his name. An example to teach vs neuer to bée aſhamed either of baniſhment or any hard eſtate wherewith God ſhall exerciſe vs for his glory, but rather to reioyce in it and comfortably to thinke of it, as Moſes doth here. The ſhame is theirs that reproach vs, the glorie is ours, if we rightly endure it.
                        3. In proceſſe of time this blody Pharaoh dyeth, ſaith the Storie, and this is a comfort to the godly, as likewiſe it ſhould be a warning to all oppreſſors of them, they ſhall die and be packing, and ſhall not continue to deale cruelly. Then ſhall they receiue the wages of their wickedneſſe, and they whom they haue wronged ſhall bée comforted. The rod of the vngodlie lighteth vpon the faithful, as God ſhall pleaſe: but the Lord hath ſaid, it ſhall not carry vpon them. And what ſwéeter comfort, but the rod of Gods iuſtice ſhall both light &amp; lie vnremooueable vpon the vngodly that repent not of their euil, and what greater woe? Let them beware then whiles there is time.
                        4. But when was it, that he dyed? Surely, forty yéeres after Moſes fled thence. Moſes was fortie when hée fled, and eighty when he came as their Deliuerer. Let it thus profit vs. You remember before, how Moſes began to exerciſe that. Office towards their reliefe, which he was certified God had appointed him vnto, and thought, that they would haue acknowledged it with thanks to God for him. But they moſt vnkindely requited him, and ſo endangered him, that he was fame to fly to ſaue his life. When he ſo began, God offered them mercy: when they ſo rewarded him, what followed? Surely, fortie yéeres more the continuance of their bondage and miſerie. A ſingular warning to all féeling hearts to beware the reiection of Gods

mercy when it is offered. For it euer hath a ſure puniſhment, and well worthy. Conſider you particularly Gods dealing with your ſelfe, what hath he offered? what dooth he yet offer you? what haue you done? or, what yet doo you? Be wiſe, and ponder. Surelie God is kinde to offer, but he is iuſt to reuēge any wilful contempt of his Offers, with continuance of bitter woe héere, or foreuer.
                        5. When he was dead, the people cryed to the Lord and ſighed, ſaith the text. Such ſobbes in ſorrow were due to them that reiected and would not ſée what God offered them of eaſe. But O comfort! yet what ſée wée againe? Surely, ſaith the text, God heard them, remembred his couenant, looked vnto them &amp; reſpected them. Swéet Father, ſo is it euer with thee, iuſt to correct, but gratious to giue ouer: not euer offended, but in due time intreated: pitifull, louing, and of endleſſe mercie. Many things more might this Chapter yéelde vs, moſt worthy noting: but, I remember, for whom I write, &amp; I would not make the volume great, that I wiſh bought &amp; vſed of poore ones; the abler perſons may haue many better helpes. A taſte of the comfort of Gods word, and the vſe thereof, (to incourage to the buying of Bibles and reading of them) is the thing I deſire to giue: and that is done, by ſomething vpon euery Chapter, though it be not much, fitted, as God inhableth mée, for the féeling and comfort of them, for whom I labour. Let this much therefore ſuiffice vpon this Chapter.

                           MOſes kept the ſheepe of Iethro; and is not this a great change, from an adopted ſon of a kings daughter, to become a ſhéepheard to a meane man? From the rauiſhing pleaſures of a Kings Court, to come to lie vnder a buſh, and behold but ſhéepe? To talke with his flocke, and ſport with his dogge, inſtéede of all he inioied before? To ruffle in his Ruſſet, ſit for that office, with adiu to garments of former honour? O ſweete experience, if neede require, of the eſtate of one moſt deere to God! Sinke not (my heart) ſo low in my body for feare of a change. Feare not that fall, that hurteth not with God. Theſe earthly ſhewes, as the ſhining Sun, flaſhe their beames abroad, and flie vpon the ſoddaine into the cloude, as if they had neuer bene. But thy God is all one with them, and without them: nay, often time more neere thee, the further thon art from them, as this very Example may aſſure thée, if thou marke it. For in all the glory of his earthlie honour, Moſes had not ſuch a conference with his God, as now, that he is a poore ſheepheard, guiding and leading another mans flocke. Dauid, by cutting away a piece of Sauls garment, made him remember himſelfe a little better: and God many times, by cutting away ſome part of our former eſtate, maketh vs profitably feele, what wee felt not before, of ſweete conſolation in him, and his hea

was ſome ſhadowe and figure. Theoderet is of the ſame minde, whoſe words are theſe. Vniuerſus locus demonſtrat deum eſſe, qui apparuit. Dicitur Angelus, vt cognoſcamus, quód is, qui viſus eſt, non eſt Deus Pater (cuius enim Angelus eſſet Pater) ſed vnigenitus Filius, qui magni conſilij eſt Angelus, qui ſacris diſcipulis dixit; Omnia quaecun

                            audiui apatre meo, nota fecivobis. Quemadmodum autem Angeli nomen poſuit, non quidem volens ministrorum quempiam innuere, ſed perſonam vnigeniti demonstrare: ſic iterum ipſius tum naturam, tum potentiam praedicat, inquiens ipſum dixiſſe: Ego ſum qui ſum, et Ego Deus Abraham, Deus Iſaack, Deus Iacob, &amp;c. The whole place, ſaith hee, ſheweth it was God: but he is called an Angell, that wee might knowe, that hee which was ſéene, was not God the father (for whoſe Angell ſhould the Father be) but the onely begotten Sonne of God, which is the Angell of the great Counſell, which ſaide to his holie Apoſtles; All thinges which I haue heard of my Father, I haue declared vnto you. And euen as hee gaue him the name of an Angell, not meaning thereby to note anie other miniſter or meſſenger, but to ſhewe the perſon of the onelie begotten Sonne: ſo againe he ſetteth forth both his nature &amp; power, ſaying he ſaid: I AM THAT I AM, and I the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, the God of Iacob, &amp;c. Hillarie alſo ſpeaketh to this effect in his booke of the Trinitie. Gregory thought it was an Angell in the perſon Greg. in praefat. moral. cap. 2. Aug. quest. 3. in Exod. et 2. de Trin. cap. 13. of God. Auguſtine varieth in his opinion, &amp;c. Touching this manner of appearing, it may occaſion vs to remember how God vſeth to applie himſelfe vnto the purpoſe and intent of his appearing, whenſoeuer it pleaſeth him to manifeſt himſelfe vnto men. For, in the Prophet Eſay, he is ſaid to haue appeared like a Judge, ſitting vpon a high throne: becauſe, as then, the iudgement of Iſrael approached Eſay. 6. 1. and drew néere. At the Baptiſme of Chriſt, it pleaſeth the holy Ghoſt to appeare like a Doue, becauſe Math. 3. 16. that forme might ſhewe the innocencie and milde nature of our Sauiour. In the Acts of the Apoſtles, like Tongues, Act. 2. 3.
                        
becauſe now the tongues of the Apoſtles were to bée framed, Acts. 2. 3. as it were, a new: like clouen tongues, becauſe the benefit was to bée deuided vnto all Nations: like firie tongues, becauſe their ſpéech, by the gratious working of GOD his holy Spirit, ſhould héereafter kindle in the hearts of men, as it were, a fire, that is, an hot and burning hatred of ſinne, a loue of rightcouſneſſe, and all holy obedience acceptable to God. And now, héere, like a buſh burning, but not conſumed, that it might declare the ſtate preſent of his people in Egypt and the condition of his Church vnto the end of the world. His people in Egypt euen burning in the fornace of Pharaohs cruelty and oppreſſion, and yet not conſumed for all that, through the mightie power and gratious goodneſſe of his ſwéete fauour that vpheld them, yea, multiplyed and increaſed them in the very flame of it. His Church militant in like ſort to expect trouble after trouble, and one woe to another, but not to bée ouerwhelmed and vtterly deſtroied by all the malice of Hel working in wicked inſtruments to ye vttermoſt. Quid ſibi vult ardere rubum, &amp; non exuri? Nempe, Iſraelem Aegyptiorū inſidijs appetitū, non eſſe ſubing andū ſed aduer ſarijs ſuperiorem futurum. What meaneth this, ſaith Theodoret, vpon this place, that the buſh burned, &amp; was not conſumed? ſurelie yt the Iſraelites be-ſet with ye wrongs of the Egypptians, ſhould yet not be ouerthrowne, but euen ouercome their aduerſaries. Philo, the Jewe, in the life of Moſes ſaith, there appeared in the middle of ye flame a glorious Image, as a manifeſt teſtimonie of the Preſence of God, &amp;c.
                     4. When Moſes ſaw this ſtrange ſight, hée ſaid, I will turne aſide now, and ſee why the buſh burneth not? where we may ſée ye good diſpoſition of men &amp; minds gouerned with Gods feare. They doo not contemne and lightly paſſe ouer ſuch things as they ſée, but they obſerue and marke, ſearche and ſéeke, what good they may poſſibly draw from them. They are of a docile and apt nature to be inſtructed, when as others, like deafe and dead people, are

not profited by any thing, but finally periſh, whatſoeuer hath béene ſhewed to them by God or man. Learne wée by Moſes, to doo as hée did; and by the other to beware of their dulneſſe.
                     5. And when the Lord ſaw that he turned aſide to ſee, Hee called him vnto Him, &amp;c. No ſooner, then, can wée ſhew willingneſſe to learne, but God is moſt readie to inſtruct and teach. If wée will heare, He wil ſpeake; and, if wée will know, Hée will declare. A ſwéete incouragement, euer to bée willing to bée informed. And now He is called LORD and GOD, as you ſée, who before is ſaid to bée an Angell, as before alſo, you remember, I noted. Moſes, Moſes, ſaith Hée familiarly and kindely: for it was euer a fauour to be called by our names of ſuperior men, much more of God. Nathaniell maruelleth how Chriſt knew him, when he ſpake of him, as you Iohn. 1. 47. reade in Iohn: but Chriſt told him, that, before Philip called him, he ſaw him vnder the fig-tree. Our God, to our comfort, knoweth vs all, and calleth his ſhéepe by their names. Happy are wée, if, as Moſes here, we may euer be readie to anſwer and ſay, I am here, Lord, or, as another ſaith, Speake-on, Lord, for thy, ſeruant heareth: or, as Dauid the Propet ſaith, my heart is readie, my heart is ready, &amp;c.

                     6. Then he ſaide, Come not hither, put thy ſhooes of thy feet: for the place where thou ſtandeſt is holy ground. Firſt, the Lord hath a care of mans infirmity, and is willing to reueale himſelfe as that may indure to behold, not further, leſt man, by His Maieſty, ſhould bée oppreſſed, when, in His mercy, he wiſheth him profited. Therefore, Come not hither, ſaith Hée, reſpecting his weakeneſſe. Secondlie, he endeuoureth to worke in Moſes that reuerence and feare, which beſéemeth Gods children, when they approach vnto God: which, although, no doubt, it was in Moſes much, yet more and more is it euer neceſſarie for all men, if they will in déede bee touched effectuallie with that which is ſpoken and done, and be truly humbled to attend

and remember. To the ſame purpoſe is that of putting-off his ſhooes: for, Quare iuſſus est Moſes calceamenta ſoluere? Certe, vt religioſiorem hac ratione illum redderet. Why was hee bidden to put-off his ſhooes (ſaith Theodoret?) Euen, that he might make him thereby more religiouſlie affected. It is alſo noted, how néedefull it is (if euer we will performe vnto GOD that reuerence that is due) to put-off that corruption and ſinne, wherewith in this life wee are clogged. Which, as the duſt to the ſhooe, and the ſhooe to the foote, cleaueth to vs. For the place where thou ſtandeſt, ſaith he, is holy ground: not that the place of it ſelfe was better than others; but that reuerence and a holy feare was due vnto God in that place; both, in regard of his incomprehenſible Glory, and of Moſes owne naturall infirmitie. Holy, I ſay, in reſpect of Gods Preſence, not otherwiſe: and therefore, nothing, héere, fauoureth any Popiſh ſuperſtition falſelie aſcribing to places what is not in them. The like you reade in Ioſua, and Ruth, which by this may be vnderſtoode, euen Ioſua. 5. 15. Ruth. 4. 7. to put away all hindering affections; and to reſigne our ſelues wholely vp vnto God, to heare and doe his will. This is to put-off our ſhooes.
                     
                     7. Then Moſes hid his face, for hee was afraid to looke vpon God. At the firſt hee was bolde, and went towards the buſh to behold this matter: but now hearing that God is there, he couereth his face, and is afraide: plainly ſhewing, that, the more God openeth himſelfe to man, and the néerer man draweth vnto God, the more hee feareth in a holy reuerence, as more féeling and finding his owne wants and vnworthineſſe to behold ſuch glory. For whileſt wee are far from God, wee can ſay and thinke with thoſe Laodiceans, I am rich and encreaſed with goods, &amp; haue 
                        Apoc. 3 17. 
                        neede of nothing, but if the Lord annoynt our eyes with his eye-ſalue, then wee change our copie, and ſée as there is ſaid, that wee are wretched, and poore, and blinde, and naked: then wee pray, that wee may haue of Gods golde to make vs rich, and white rayment, that wee may bee

cloathed, and that our filthie nakednes doe not appeare. Then wee couer our face, as Moſes did héere, and wee humbly and modeſtly come to heare him, trembling at his words with a contrite ſpirit: well vnderſtanding that they Eſay. 66. 2. are iuſtlie ouerthrowne in their owne pride, who raſhlie preſume they can conceiue Gods myſteries with their owne wits.
                     8. Hauing then thus prepared his Seruant to humble attention, the Lord beginneth his tale, and ſaith, I haue ſurely ſeene the trouble of my people, &amp;c. Where, euerie word hath vehemencie and matter worthie noting. Hee ſaith, hee hath ſéene, hee hath heard, and hee knoweth: and how hath hee ſéene? Videndo vidi, ſéeing I haue ſéene; that is, vidi certó et ſerió, I haue ſéene certainly and ſeriouſlie: verborum enim geminatione, vehementia, certitudo et celeritas ſignificatur, by the doubling of the word, vehemencie, certaintie and celeritie is ſignified, ſaith a Diuine. I haue ſéene, and ſo ſéene, as that I can no longer hold my peace: yea, I haue ſo ſéene, as that I will helpe, and endure no longer. Vidiſſe enim dicitur compaſsionis oculo et miſerationis aſpectu. For hee is ſaid to haue ſéene with eie of compaſſion, and with a mercifull beholding, ſaith Beda. And what haſt thou thus ſéene, Lord? Euen the trouble of my people which are in Egypt. Firſt then, trouble and anguiſh is knowne to thée, &amp; there is no ſorrowe hid from thine eyes, be it neuer ſo ſecret and hidden in the heart, encloſed in the breaſt and bowels of man or woman, not daring to péepe out for feare of ſome circumſtance that might encreaſe our paine: but yet thou ſéeſt it not ſo, that thou wilt redreſſe it, except they bee thy people. For ſo thou ſpeakeſt in this place, that, thou haſt ſeene the trouble of thy people. If then wee would haue griefe ſéene and helped, wee muſt endeauour with all godly care to be thine. Which if wee doe, then ſighing and groaning in our ſeuerall occaſions, as theſe did, wee may be ſure in due time to finde our comfort, as they found. Affliction alſo, wee may

héere learne, doth not ſhewe that the partie is diſliked of God (as Sathan often will ſuggeſt to men and women that are in trouble:) for God calleth theſe Iſraelites his people, which yet in moſt extraordinarie affliction were plunged. Hée is not as the proud Peacocks of this world, that knowe a man in a gay coate and an high Office, but in pouertie and baſenes knowe him not, though hée bee moſt néere, yea, almoſt their owne father or mother, ſiſter or brother. But in the pooreſt plight, when the back is bare, for want of cloathing; the face leane, with woe of heart, and quite altered with briniſh teares, that guſhed along it, and haue worne furrowes in it, in ſteade of former hue; when the head hangeth for bitter cares; and all the bones are in a manner out of ioynt, with racking tortures of bloodie Tyrants; Then, euen then, doth the Lord knowe his, and as ſwéetly acknowledgeth them for his owne, as euer in any proſperitie that they enioyed, or the chiefeſt comforts they euer profeſſed.
                     9. From ſéeing, then, the Lord commeth to hearing, and ſaith, Hee hath heard their crie, becauſe of their Taskmaiſters; telling vs, what the prayers of his children are in his eares, euen loude cries, and, cries, that are heard to their good, in Gods due time, and to their aduerſaries woe, that ſo ſpitefully &amp; wickedly haue oppreſſed them. Which if thou wouldeſt in due time conſider, that wrongeſt anie man, it would be good for thée, and God is mercifull: if not, conſider the vehemencie of his moane, that thou ſo dealeſt withall, how God calleth it a crie, a crie that awaketh him vp vnto iudgement againſt thée, and thou ſhalt be deſtroyed. Thou art an oppreſſing, vexing Taſke-maiſter, like theſe Egyptians, and thou ſhalt be deſtroyed, as God is God, without amendment, in the Red-ſea, or Black-ſea of Helliſh déepes: where the torment is intollerable, and from whence no man nor meanes can euer deliuer thée. Thy will in this world to be gained and gotten with ſuch a price; thinke of it.
                     
                        
10 The Lord is not ſatiſfied, to haue ſaide, Hee ſeeth and Hee heareth, but hee addeth the third, Hee knoweth. For I knowe their ſorrowes, ſaith hee. It is our comfort, that Hee knoweth: and it may be the wickeds terror, that Hee knoweth. Enough being ſaide of it, I add but this, he that then ſawe, heard, and knewe, is the ſame ſtill: No changeling in Loue to his deare Choſen, no changeling in Juſtice to the ſtubborne ſinner, and be inſtructed by it. Our heauenly Father knoweth what wee haue neede of. Héere they had néede of Deliuerance; and hee, therefore, knowing as well as they, commeth downe to giue it them according to his ſwéete mercy. Deſcendere dicitur Deus per affectū (loco enim nō deſcendit) quando fauet nobis et auxiliatur, &amp;c. Ʋel, deſcendere dicitur, inquit Euſebius, quando aliquid novum, quod antea non fuerat in creatura humana, operatur. God is ſaid to come downe, by his affection or loue (for touching place he deſcendeth not) when he fauoureth &amp; helpeth vs; or, God is ſaid to come down, ſaith Euſebius, when he doth any new thing, which before was not done among men.
                     11. Come now therefore, and I will ſend thee vnto Pharaoh, ſaith God to Moſes, &amp;c. God was able to haue done it himſelfe, without Moſes, or any man: but hee will vſe meanes, commonly, to effect his will; that his mercie and goodnes may be ſéene in his Creatures; as likewiſe, his power and wiſedome, to his great glory. Hée might alſo haue vſed a far more excellent meanes, than Moſes: as, fome King, or great Prince in earth; or, ſome of his glorious Angels in Heauen, (for ſo he did, when by Cyrus hée wrought their Deliuerance out of the Captiuitie, and when by an Angell hée brought Peter out of priſon:) but his purpoſe was in their Deliuerie, to make knowne his incomprehenſible Power to Pharaoh &amp; many more, vnto the worlds end. And therefore he would chooſe no ſtronger a meanes now, than Moſes, Iethro his Shéepe-kéeper; knowing, how apt man is, to obſcure Gods glory, with the quality of the meanes; and to aſcribe vnto the ſecond

cauſe, what onely hath béene wrought by the firſt cauſe. Againe, this was a Figure, that from the ſpirituall thraldome and bondage of death, ſinne, and the Deuill, he ſhould deliuer his people vnder the Goſpell, not by the helpe of learned Philoſophers, or any glorious worldly Potentates, but by a company of poore Fiſher-men, vnlettered and vnthought vpon in the world.
                     12. But Moſes ſaide vnto God, who am I, that I ſhould goe vnto Pharaoh, and bring the Children of Iſraell out of Egypt? (Smitten with a ſenſe and féeling of his owne weakeneſſe, to doe ſuch a ſeruice) which indéede is the very true and right way to make vs fit in Gods eies. For then wée ſlie to him, and by faithfull prayer beg and craue, what in our ſelues wée ſée not, till hée giue it. Such as are not thus touched and humbled, but ruſh into Callings raſhly, preſuming on their owne ſtrength and abilities, dayly Experiences ſhew, how often God confoundeth them and throweth them downe to their great ſhame. Who am I, Lord, therefore, let vs euer ſay, that thou ſhouldeſt thus, and thus, thinke of me, chooſe mee, and take me to that place, that I haue no ſtrength to manage, and which thouſands of my brethren are fitter for, by ſuper-excellency of gifts, than I am: thus ſaid the Kingly Prophet, Dauid, you know, when hée looked vpon Gods fauours towards him. O, what am I, and my fathers houſe, that thou ſhouldeſt doo thus vnto mee? Now, as this is moſt commendable humility in Gods ſeruant; ſo is it true and ſound wiſedome, not to looke at the honour, and forget the burden, but to ſée the one, as wel as the other. It was a great honor to be ſent for ſuch a ſeruice: but it was a weighty Charge, and a heauie care, aſwell as an honour. What? ſhall I go to Pharaoh? Shall I deliuer Iſrael? And ſhall I haue the leading and gouernement of ſuch a mightie multitude, till God hath diſpoſed of them? Why? it is a thing that requireth great ſtrength and many parts, that I haue not. O LORD, who am I? May not this, then, a little occaſion

vs to thinke of ſpirituall gouernment? for is it ſuch a matter to ſtriue with Pharaoh for bodies and temporall ſeruitude, and is it nothing to fight with Sathan and the power of Hell for ſoules and fréedome from eternall bondage? Is it not fearefull, I will require the blood at thy 
                        Ezec. 33. 1. Kings 3. 
                        hand? &amp;c. As Salomon therefore in the temporall charge ſaw a weighty burden, and thereupon craued wiſedome, to bée able to goe in and out, as he ought, before that multitude: Ier. 1. Ionas. 1 ſo ſaw Ieremie and Ionas a great matter, when the one ſaid, Alas! I am achilde, &amp; cannot ſpeake: and the other flatly fled and refuſed to goe. Others haue done the like, &amp; yet Ambition pricketh forwarde, for al this, many a man. Simon Magus would haue béene an Apoſtle in power for Act. 8. Math. 27. reſpects; be the charge what it may be, that troubleth not him. Saint Peter iumpeth into danger, preſuming of ſtrength, but he faileth and falleth, he lyeth and denieth, and diſcouereth his weakeneſſe greatly. Once againe therfore looke we at Moſes modeſty &amp; humilitie in this place, ſaying, Lord, who am I?
                     
                     13. Now ſee, what this lowly conceit worketh. It getteth him comfort and ſtrength from God; for ſtreightway God anſwered him, &amp; ſaide, I will be with thee: as if he ſhould ſay, looke not thou at thy ſelfe and thy power, but looke at me and my power. And though thou art weake, yet know me to be ſtrong and euer able to ſtrengthen them whom I call to a ſeruice, to performe the ſame. And I do not ſay to thee, that I will helpe thee now and then; but, I will be with thee; that is, euer and continually I will aid 
                           
                              •
                           r

                            tecum. thee in this worke, euen I, not any Angels of mine, but I my ſelfe; and therefore feare not. What greater comfort might he wiſh? And who would not throw himſelfe down, thus to bee raiſed vp? or, who would not ſee his owne wants, thus to receiue grace? Remēber how in like ſort he comforted Ieremie and Ezechiel with others of the Prophets; alſo his Apoſtles after, in their time, ſaying: Be of good comfort, I haue ouercome the world; and, I will

be with you, till the end of the world. With God al things 
                        Ero vobiſcum. 
                        are poſſible, &amp;c.
                     
                     4. It contenteth not the Lord to make this mercifull promiſe of his preſence with Moſes, but he further aſiſteth his weakeneſſe with a Signe, ſaying: This ſhalbe a token vnto thee, &amp;c. Where we may remember, yt Signes vſed of God to confirm his childrens faith, ſometimes go before, and ſometimes follow after. Gedeon had a Signe goingbefore namelie, the fléece of wooll, firſt wet, and then drie. Iudg. 6. Eſay. 38. 
                        Ezechias had the like in the ſhadow of the diall going ten degrées backe. But in another place the ſame Ezechias had a Signe that followed, to wit, when, for aſſurance, that hée would deliuer Jeruſalem beſieged by the Aſſyrians, he Eſay. 37. 30. ſaid: This ſhall bee a Signe vnto thee, O Ezechias, Thou ſhalt eate this yeare ſuch as groweth of it ſelfe, and the ſecond yeere, ſuch things as grow without ſowing; and in the third yeare, ſow ye and reape and plant Vine-yardes and eate the fruits thereof. As if he ſhould haue ſaid, whereas (vſually and by reaſon) after war commeth famine, becauſe men cannot huſband their grounds; yet it ſhall not bée ſo with you: but for two yéeres, the ground it ſelfe ſhall féede you, and let this ſuffice for a Signe of hope and comfort againſt this feare. So, in this place, Moſes, feare not, for I will be with thee; and, for a ſigne, thou ſhalt bring them forth and ſerue me in this mountaine. This thou ſhalt ſée, as truly as I tell thee, and then this will be aſigne that I was with thee according to my promiſe. What a nature now is this in our déere GOD, thus to ſubmit himſelfe to mans weakeneſſe, and in ſteade of chiding and puniſhing man for it, to helpe it and ſtay it with all comfortable tokens and ſignes? O who would not truſt in this God, and beléeue what he promiſeth? Nay, who hath not cauſe, that obſerueth theſe things, to bée of the Prophet Dauids minde? Bleſſed is the man that putteth his truſt in him.
                     
                     15. This, as it ought, contented Moſes; and therefore, leauing the matter of his owne infirmity, be caſteth his

mind next, vpon the infirmity of the Iſraelites, to whom he muſt goe. And fearing leſt (according to their former backewardneſſe, whereof hée had taſted) they would ſtand in doubt of the truth of his authority to deliuer ſuch matter from the Lord vnto them, hée prayeth the Lord to inſtruct him what he ſhall ſay, if they aſke him, what is his Name? Which queſtion was allowable in Moſes, becauſe it had relation to others, not to himſelfe. For, when Iacob would know the Angels name that wreſtled with him, for himſelfe, that is, to ſatiſſte his owne curioſity: he was anſwered, wherefore doeſt thou aske my Name? and it was not Gen. 32. 29 told him, yet he bleſſed him. So Manoah, Samſons Father, aſked the Angell the like queſtion, &amp; in like ſort was anſwered; Why askeſt thou thus after my Name which is ſecret (or wonderfull?) and told him not. The reaſon Iudg. 13. 17. may appeare in the place: becauſe Manoah aſkes it that hée might honour him, not with an eye to the profit of others, as Moſes did héere. Therefore the Lord anſwered Moſes, &amp; ſaid; I AM THAT I AM; &amp; thus ſhalt thou ſay to the Children of Iſrael, I AM hath ſent me vnto you. That is, ye God that is no Changeling, but the ſame for euer; who, as hee hath done for them and their Fathers very great things; ſo can he againe, if they will be obedient to his will, with like power, mercy and goodneſſe, deliuer them and free them from this bondage wherein they groane, as cruelly vexed and oppreſſed. See then a ſweete Comfort in all our feares, euen his name, I AM. Noting, that, as he hath beene to penitent ſinners, ſo euer he will be without any change. If I turne vnto him, call vpon him, and withall faithfull truſt of my inwarde ſoule depend vpon him; I AM is his Name, and I may not doubt of him. Haue not I my ſelfe fonnd him ſweet, cō
                        fortable, &amp; good, 10000. times, as well as other ſinners? Hath not your hearts beene touched by him ſundry times to very good purpoſes? Hath not another-man founde him gratious and kinde in his worldly eſtate and aduancement

to honour, when hee might have paſſed him ouer, and haue had choiſe inough? So let euery man run-ouer his priuate fauours. How, then, may euer any of vs fall from him without moſt great reproofe, or euer faint and feare that he will forſake vs. I AM, I ſay againe, is his Name, and we muſt be taught by it, that hee is a God without all change, towards ſuch as ſtedfaſtly cleaue vnto him. The Lord, then, giue vs vſe in all our feares, of this Comfort, ſtrengthen our weakeneſſe to beleeue, and euer, in mercy, looke vpon vs.
                     16. After this, hée appointed Moſes his Order of going, and publiſhing this meſſage: to wit, that firſt hée ſhould goe to the Elders, and call them together, and make them acquainted with it, before he dealt with the Common people. Where, wée muſt take the name of Elder, for a name of Office, (not of yeares) for ſo we know the Scripture ſpeaketh. Not euer the oldeſt men beare Office either in Church or common wealth: but, as God giueth guifts, and appointeth in his prouidence Places vnto them of gouernement and charge; ſo, in regard thereof they are called the Elders, that is, the Rulers and Gouernours, (though in yeares ſomthing young) as Timothy and others were. Now marke we, to our good, in this, firſt, that vnder the great tyrannie of Pharaoh, yet ſome liberty was giuen theſe Iſraelites to meete for Religion and knowledge, inſtruction and vnderſtanding, according to the right way which the Lord had acquainted them with; albeit that ſame, of the Egyptians, was not receiued nor allowed. And how doth this amplifie the bloody crueltie of Antichriſt, who yeeldeth not ſo much to his fellow-Chriſtians, I meane, to people profeſſing Chriſt (as he pretendeth he doth) as bloody Pharaoh yeelded to ye Jewes, who ioined not in profeſſion with him? Secondly obſerue we the Wiſedome, liked &amp; preſcribed of God for a Rule euer to guide our ſelues by, and our actions: to wit, when any new thing is to be publiſhed, that concerneth

any change in the Church or Common-wealth, firſt to acquaint the Magiſtrates, Rulers and Gouernors with it, to approue our commiſſion and matter vnto them with all modeſty, humility, loue and care of order and vnitie; and then with their conſents, approbation, and aide, vnto the people and multitude. This is a right courſe, wée ſée, and this ſhall haue a bleſſing from the Author of it, as here it had. Then ſhall they obey thy voice, &amp;c. ver. 18. id eſt, credent &amp; acquieſcent tibi, vt prudentes, &amp; qui promiſſiones Abrahae &amp; patribus factas norunt, maximè, Gen. 15. Quarta generatione reuertentur huc, &amp;c. That is, they ſhall beléeue thée and yéelde vnto thee, as wiſe-men, and ſuch as know the promiſes made vnto Abraham and the fathers, eſpecially Gen. the 15. In the fourth generation they ſhall returne hither, &amp;c. Other vaine-glorious, factious, and diſorderly dealings will haue their confuſion, and will bee ſtrangled with the haulter of their owne diſobedience, euen in their youth, that is, before they come to any perfection or ripeneſſe. For God is the Author of Order, Gouernement, and Rule: who appointing Elders and ſuperiors for the peace and quietneſſe of his Church euer hindered with diuiſions and tumults, will haue them duly regarded and reſpected as they ought, not as far as wee lift. Thinke we then of it with a religious féeling, and the Lord giue vs vnderſtanding in all things.
                     17. Then, after thus thou haſt acquainted the Heads of the people of Iſraell with it, and they, by my working in-wardely with them, willing to obey; both thou and they ſhall go to Pharaoh, the king, and ſay, &amp;c. Sée againe, and ſtill ſtill moſt carefully note it, how God regardeth Gouernment. For now Pharaoh muſt bée vſed, as was fit for his Place, (He being the king of the lande in which they were) wicked Pharaoh, I ſay, muſt not be diſorderly dealt with by ſuch as liue vnder his gouernment, &amp; within his Territories, although ſtrangers, and not his naturall Subiects: how much leſſe, then, by naturall Subiects? But hee muſt be gone vnto with all dutie, and acquainted,

with all reuerence, with their deſire: that, neither themſelues may be iudged factious, neither others, by their examples, moued to any diſorder. They muſt acquaint him with the Author of this deſire, not their owne heads, luſting after liberty or nouelitie, but the Lord God, that is, that Lord which is God, and that GOD which is Lord and Lord of Lords to worke ſome touch, in Pharaoh, of feare. Secondly, the Lord God of the Hebrewes, that is, that hath euer had care of them, and dealt for them, as ſéemed good to his Wiſedome. Thirdly, that their ſcope was Religion, not rebellion, nor any vndutifull practiſe againſt ye ſtate. Shall not this moue vs to reuerence authoritie, when God thus notablie ſheweth his liking of it? It is enough in this place, if God be with vs. Laſtly, obſerue the long ſufferance of God, who, though by this Pharaoh verie much offended, yet before hee will ſmite, he will admoniſh, and doe all things ſo, as his owne hart ſhall teſtifie his owne inexcuſable wickednes. Certainly euen thus the Lord dealeth with our ſelues, if wee had eyes to ſée it, ſtill forewarning, and calling to a touch, before hee determine Judgement and iuſt deſtruction. His Preachers and Prophets, his rods and his croſſes, his fauours and bounties be all Admoniſhers of vs to auoide his wrath.
                     18. Cum Deus praenoſcet contumaciam Pharaonis, cur ab initio non puniuit illum? Cum Deus bonus &amp; humanus ſit, non vult punire ex ſola praeſcientia, ſed expectat opperum conſumationē, &amp; ita omnibus oſtendit quam iuſte puniat. Alioqui etiā longe aequius eſt Pharaonis nequitiam patefieri, quam Deum crudelem appellari. Nam ſi puniuiſſet antequā redarguiſſet, crudelis vtique viſus eſſet et iniquus. Nunc autem perſpicitur Dei longanimitas, &amp; Pharaonis impietas atque feritas conuincitur. Theodoret. in Exod. 
                        But I knowe that the King of Egypt will not let you goe, but by ſtrong hand. Therefore will I ſttetch out my hand, and ſmite Egypt with all my wonders which I will doe in the midſt thereof: and after that ſhall hee let you goe. How well doth the Lord ſée, what the wicked thinke is ſecret and hidden? to wit, their thoughts and purpoſes, their diſpoſitions and nature: yea, before themſelues knowe what they will doe, he knoweth: and ſhall not this moue them? Their ſtubborne and ſtiffe harts contemning admonitions and all meanes of their reformation, the Lord knoweth and ſéeth before. How may this comfort the zealous Miniſter, that is wearied and waſted with longing after the life of them that wiſh his death, with praying, entreating,

and crying vpon men for their good, that they would hearken and conſider, that they would be reconciled to God, and ſaue their ſoules? I ſay, how may this comfort him, that this blockiſhnes and hardnes, this ingratitude and vnkindnes of theirs was knowne to the Lord euer? And therefore to content himſelfe, that he hath giuen warning like a faithfull Watchman, that hee hath loued like a faithfull Paſtor, and endeauoured their good, as a true Miniſter: leauing the Lord, now, to his further pleaſure, euen, to ſtretch out his hand, and to ſmite ſuch Pharaohs with their Land, that is, their poſſeſſions and goods, their friends and aſſociates, as héere hee did: for, till Pharaoh féele it, hee will not thinke of His might. The Preacher ſpeaketh in the aire, the friend priuately looſeth his labour, and honeſt aduiſe: Pharaoh féeleth not, but thinketh himſelfe wiſe, and them, fooles. Their loue returneth therefore into their owne boſome, being noted in Gods Booke, for a Witnes againſt them; and that ſwéete comfort ſheweth it ſelfe to be taken hold of; Wée are a ſwéete ſauour to the Lord in them that periſh. After this, conſider with your ſelfe héere againe in that it is ſaide, Pharaoh will not let them goe, but by ſtrong hand; How far more eaſie it is to come into Egypt, than to get out? So it is aſſuredlie a ſmooth way to Hell, by many pleaſant delights; but, to returne and giue ouer the ſinne once entred into, to forſake that pleaſant way, This is a worke, This is a labour, nay This is a Grace indéede. Any man may leape into a pit at his pleaſure, but hee muſt come out with more difficultie, if euer hee come out. Therefore, in my conceite, the good woman dealt wiſely with the Frier that ſolicited her to ſinne, and told her, hée would ſing and ſay prayers for her, that ſhould cleanſe her from all her offence, and deliuer her preſently out of Purgatorie, (if ſhee ſhould happen to die whileſt hee was aliue) when ſhee appointed a pit to be digged in the way where the Fryer ſhould come in the night, and to be couered with ſome graſſe, that it might not appeare;

into which, as ſoone as euer the Fryer came, he fell, and not able any way to get out againe. Anon, when hée had cooled himſelfe well, the woman came alſo, as though ſhée had come to méete him, to whom the poore Fryer pittifully complaineth, that hee was fallen into that pit, there, and could not get out; praying her to vſe ſome meanes for his deliuerance. But ſhee wiſely tolde him, hee ſhould remember what hee ſaid vnto her, to wit, that, out of the pit of Purgatorie, hee could ſing her or any that ſhould offend with him: and now, there, was a good place to trie the power of his Muſicke and Songs, that ſhée and others might beléeue him the better. If hee would haue his Porteſſe ſent for, ſhée ſaid, ſhée would; but other helpe hee ſhould get none of her: And ſo ſhee left him to ſing himſelfe out, if hee could. So ſleight a matter made thoſe Hypocrites then, of fearefull ſinne, eaſily purged, and eaſilie pardoned, were it neuer ſo wittingly and wilfully committed. But this Figure of the hardnes to get out of Egypt, when once they were in, may ſhew vs, as I ſay, apparantly the contrarie, and giue vs iuſt and good cauſe to beware of ſinne. The deuill is not ſuch a fooliſh Fowler, to let ſlip eaſely the bird he hath caught. Euery mans owne experience telleth him, how hard it is, to leaue a wonted wrying from the right way: and God graunt wee may thinke of it.
                     19. Laſtly, the Lord addeth, that Hee would make 
                        Verſe. 21. 
                        them fauoured of the Egyptians: ſo that, when they departed they ſhould not goe emptie, &amp;c. Where, to our comfort, wée ſée, that all harts are in the hands of God, euen as the riuers of water: and, that hee turneth them hither and thither, at his pleaſure. Hée can make them loue, hate they neuer ſo much: and they ſhall not bee able to withſtand his will. Yea, hee can make them ſo loue, that fruites, from thence, ſhall flowe to his people, of their loue, euen as hee beſt liketh. Be they Jewels of ſiluer, or Jewels of gold, Rayment, or any thing néedefull

and wiſhed, they ſhal graunt it and lend it, giue it or ſend it, with a fauour, with a loue, &amp; with ſo willing a mind, as the partie taking, néedeth to wiſh. This ſhall the Lord doe by a ſecret power of his working grace and fauour for his people to their good. This was that, which hee did for Iacob, the Father of theſe Iſraelites: when Laban angerly purſued him, the Lord changed his hart. To Iſaac and Abraham, before, the Lord gaue fauour in ſeuerall places: To Ioſeph, the like, to his owne comfort, and the good of many. And this is it, which the Pſalmiſt affirmeth: The Lord giues grace and worſhip, and no good thing ſhall he with-hold from them that liue a godly life. This is it, which all of vs haue taſted of, euen, in our ſelues: and God make vs thankfull. Thus may wee profit by this Chapter.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. 4.
                     
                        The generall Heads of this Chapter are chiefely theſe.

                              Moſes his power to worke myracles.
                              His excuſes not to goe into Egypt.
                              His comming to Egypt at laſt.
                           
                        
                     
                     1. 
                           BVtloe, they wil not beleeue me, ſayd Moſes, &amp;c. Sée firſt and formoſt the ingrafted weakenes of mans nature, when any great or difficult thing is to be taken in hand. It is euer fearing and doubting, euer quaking and ſhaking, euer caſting of perils, more than ſtand with that prompt readines and willingnes, which ought to be in all the ſeruants of God, when he, their Lord, once ſpeaketh and ſaith, Doe this. Such feare, as this, was in Ionas, when he was commanded Ionas. 1.
                        
to Niniuie. In Ieremie, when hee was cauſed to prophecie: Ierem. 1. and, in many others. Secondly, obſerue in theſe words alſo, what a powerfull Pul-backe, euen to the beſt mindes, incredulitie &amp; crookednes in the people is. Surely it pierceth déepe, and woundeth fore, as you ſée in this place. For euen the feare of it, héere, daunteth Moſes, a man of Hebre. 11. ſuch faith, a man of ſuch grace, as wee reade, before this, hee had ſhewed himſelfe to be. What? what will it doe, when it is not feared, but found; not ſuſpected, but tried and taſted of euery day? Let that great Prophet of the 1. Kings. 19. Lord tell vs, whom it ſo wounded, that he ſate him downe, and deſired to die, to be out of woe, ſaying; It is enough, Lord, now, it is enough; take my ſoule, for I am no better than my Fathers. Let Eſay, againe, another famous Eſay. 53. 1. Prophet witnes, whoſe words ſhewed woe, when hee ſaid and wrote: Who will beleeue our report? and to whom is the arme of the Lord reuealed? as if he ſhould haue ſaid, (Alas! alas!) what comfort haue wée when ſo vngraciouſly our preaching is reiected, and the comfortable tidings of Jeſus Chriſt not beléeued? Let the ſighes of Ieremie and the groanes of his ſoule, when he cries, Ah Lord, &amp;c, witnes the like alſo to all Readers: but moſt wonderfully, that ſpirituall battell that hée tooke ſuch a fearefull fall in, as that hee ſaid; I will not make mention of 
                        Ier. 20. 9. 
                        him, nor ſpeake any more in his name. O firie dart, then, and piercing ſtroke to a tender hart of fleſh that meaneth well! an vntoward and froward people, when ſo great a Prophet thus is ſhaken by it. I néede to purſue this matter no further, wee ſée enough; yet could I remember you of other Prophets alſo, and many moe deare children of Mich. 7. 1. God, faithfull members and Miniſters in the Lords buſines, whom yet crookednes of the people hath mightily agréeued, diſcouraged, and diſmayde: yea, it cauſed a ſigh in our very Sauiour from the rootes of his hart, that the Math. 11, 17. people hee ſpake vnto, ſo fitly might be reſembled to children complained of for not dauncing when they were

piped vnto; not lamenting, when they were mourned vnto, &amp;c. Conclude wee therefore what wee ſée héere, the effect of incredulitie in the people, to be bitter to the Lords Meſſengers ſent or to bee ſent vnto them for their good. But ſo ſée wee it, that our ſelues auoide it, and both day and night pray againſt it; remembring alwaies, as deare children, the Apoſtles words to the Hebrewes: Obey them that haue the ouer-ſight of you, and ſubmit your ſelues: 
                        Heb. 13. 17. 
                        for they watch for your Soules, as they that muſt giue accompts, that they may giue it with ioy, and not with griefe, for that is vnprofitable for you, &amp;c. The like Scriptures there are many moe, all which may comfort vs, if wee obey them; and iuſtly iudge vs vnto the lake of Hell, if we contemne them. God that biddeth will neuer be abuſed finally, but will repay. Ionas had rather commit himſelfe to the wilde Sea and raging gulfes, than goe to preach to a people, that hee could conceiue no hope of, that they would beléeue, and be turned vnto God.
                     2. This infirmitie in Moſes the Lord mercifully cureth, when, in iuſtice, hee might haue reiected him for it: So good and gracious is our God. Hée cureth it by a power giuen him to worke Miracles ſo great and fearefull, that, if not to moue Pharaoh to true repentance, yet aboundantly to ſhewe his authoritie from God to conduct that people, they ſhould ſuffice. His Rod is turned to a Serpent, and backe againe to his owne nature. His hand put into his boſome is become leaprous, and by and by whole againe. The water is turned into blood; and other great things wrought, when hee came before Pharaoh. Thus can the Lord, and thus will the Lord enable euer to the worke that he appointeth and calleth vnto. A great comfort to Magiſtrates and Miniſters, if it bee well conſidered.
                     3. Then flieth hée to another excuſe, and ſaith: Hee is not eloquent. But the Lord alſo prouideth for that, as you ſée in the Text, and promiſeth helpe: Still ſo weake

and wayward is man, and ſo good and gracious is God. The Jewes haue a Tale amongſt them, how Moſes came by this infirmitie of ſpéech: And ſay, that, when hee was a childe and brought by Pharaohs daughter before her Father the King; the King playing with him, and offering hun his golden Crowne; the childe tooke it, and threwe it vnder his féete: wherewith the King being offended, and ſome lookers on iudging it Fatall (as if that childe ſhould ouerthrowe the King,) the Nurſe, to ſhew the childes want of wit, put an hote coale to his mouth, which hee ſtreight licked with his tongue, and ſo hurt his ſpéech. But the Scripture telleth vs not any cauſe, and therefore ignorance is beſt. Cum omniune Dom. Moſis miniſterio vti velit, cur tardiorie linguae fecit illis &amp;c? Quia hoc Potentiam Diuinam magis illuſtrabat. Quē
                           admodum enim Piſcatores, Publicanos, &amp; Cerdones veritatis praedicatores &amp; Doctores pietatis creauit: ſic per vocem infirmam &amp; linguam tardam confudit 
                              〈◊〉
                            ſapientes Egypti. Theodoret in locum. This rightly wee may note, that God chooſeth men in mans eies not ſo fit, that his glory may more appeare: and therefore take wee héede, how wee cenſure our Calling for ſome defects, ſince God could haue made Moſes eloquent, and did not. In our owne Stories, how M. Tyndall complained for want of vtterance, wée ſée: and yet, what a notable member and Martyr in Gods Church was hee?
                     4. Laſtly, when theſe excuſes ſerue not, Moſes breaketh out euen to an height of weakenes, and prayeth him to ſend ſome other. A ſtrange thing, that a man ſo full of Gods Spirit, after ſuch comforts, ſhould yet bee ſo backward. But this is, againe, I ſay, the mightie diſcomfort of incredulitie, and want of the taſt of good things: when a man, before hee goeth to doe his meſſage, cannot conceiue, that his ſeruice ſhall preuaile. And, I would all Gods people might marke it with féeling: for then ſhould they ſée, how Preachers harts conſume to duſt within them, by griefe conceiued of backwardnes, waywardnes, and incredulitie of their hearers, to whom God hath ſent them. O! it biteth and wringeth day and night, it lieth gnawing and grinding the whole inwards, when others comfortably féede vpon ioy and mirth. It maketh a great Prophet fearefully to paſſe the bounds of patience, and forget

himſelfe. For, Curſed be the day wherein I was borne, (ſaith that worthie Ieremiah) and let not the day, wherein 
                        Ier. 20. 14. 
                        my mother bare me, be bleſſed. Curſed be the man that ſhewed my Father, ſaying, A man-childe is borne vnto 
                        15. 
                        thee, and comforted him. And let that man be as the Cities, 
                        16. 
                        which the Lord hath ouer-turned and repented not: and let him heare the crie in the morning, and the ſhouting at noone-tide, Becauſe hee hath not ſlaine me, euen from the wombe, or that my mother might haue beene my 
                        17. 
                        graue, or her wombe a perpetuall conception. How is it, that I came out of the wombe to ſee labour and ſorrowe, 
                        18. 
                        that my dayes ſhould be conſumed with ſhame? And ſhal this be good for ſuch people as cauſe it, thinke you? No, no, ſaith the Lord: But, Obey them that haue the ouer-ſight of your ſoules, as they that muſt giue accompts; that they 
                        Heb. 13. 17. 
                        may giue it with ioy, and not with griefe; for that is vnprofitable for you. Unprofitable for you, I ſay againe, and marke it. Now, then, mourneth the Preacher; but the day commeth when ſuch Hearers ſhall mourne, yea rore and crie in the wound of their conſciences for ſuch Diſcomforts giuen to Gods Meſſengers ſent vnto them. O what are wee, in this age, to Moſes, the great Seruant of the Lord? And yet hee, for feare of this, is ſo out of hart, that hee prayeth God plainly, to ſend ſome other. Wee feare it not, but féele it, finde it, and ſée it; and haue not the Spirit in ſuch meaſure, as Moſes had. Alas! how can it be, but, ſometimes, our weakenes ſhould appeare?
                     5. Doe wee then iuſtifie Moſes in this? No, the Lord doth not iuſtifie him, and therefore wee cannot. For, Then the Lord was very angry with Moſes, ſaith the Text: not verſe, 14. 
                        angry onely, but very angry. So that wee ſée moſt apparantly héere, that there muſt be a meaſure, at leaſt, in our paſſions and tendernes; or elſe God is prouoked to great anger. If the Lord appoint vs, we muſt goe: if wee feare, or finde diſcomfort we muſt beare, &amp; continue ſtill obedient to God in our ſeruice, who wil giue an iſſue to his pleaſure.

And in the meane time, to our vnſpeakeable comfort, hath ſaide: That we are a ſweet ſauour to him in them that periſh. Yet the Lord caſteth not a way his ſeruant, for all this: but telleth him againe that Aaron ſhall be his 
                        ver. 16. 
                        Spokeſmā to the people &amp;c. Setting ye authority in Moſes, &amp; making Aaron, as it were, his Interpreter. Not vnlike ye example of Flauianus in the Hiſtory of Theodoret. Moreouer, Lib. 4. cap. 25. ver. 17. ſaith hée, Thou ſhalt take this rod in thine hand, and doo miracles, Where wée may not dreame of any vertue inthe rod, but caſt both eies and heart vpon God; who is able to make his Seruant with a poore Rod, to match a kings glorious Scepter.
                     6. Then Moſes yéeldeth to Gods commaundement, &amp; returning to Iethro his father-in-law, prayeth him to let 
                        ver. 18. 
                        him goe, &amp;c. Yéelding vs therein theſe Obſeruations. Firſt, that hée will giue no offence to Iethro, by departing otherwiſe than was fit: Seruants and Subiects may profit by it. Secondly, he concealeth, as it ſéemeth, the matter from him; leſt to a man not ſo fully yet taſting Heauenlie things, it might ſéeme vnlikelie, and ſo hée bée aſſalted with new Pulbacks. Thirdly, he delayeth not, but ſpéedily addreſſeth himſelfe to his buſineſſe. And laſtly, though outwardly he appeare but the ſame man, yet inwardly he hath thoughts concerning Gods glorie, which is a very Patterne for all good hearers of Gods word.
                     7. Iethro hindreth not; though, no doubt, it was to his great griefe (according to nature) to part with him and with his Daughter, and their Children. So is it euery one of our duties to yéelde vnto the will and working of God in all things. For his we are, and for his glory and ſeruice wée haue béene created: where, when, how, and how long, they are circumſtances knowne and directed by him euer to the beſt, if wée beleeue and obey. Moſes taketh the Rod of God in his hand, ſaith ye Text, his Wife &amp; his 
                        ver. 20. 
                        Sonnes vpon an Aſſe, and away he goeth.. Huſbands, ſee the heart of a good man, to haue his wife and children with

him: Wiues and Children, ſee a dutie due, to be followers willinglie of their Huſbands or Fathers calling, euen into any country. And when I looke at his Rod, mée thinke I ſée liuelie little Dauid, marching chéerefully with his ſtaffe and ſcrip againſt huge Goliah. Good Lord! what weapons were thoſe againſt him, then, in mans eies, or this ſtaffe, now, in Moſes hand, againſt mighty Pharoah of Egypt? But God is the ſame, both héere, and then, and Sed Deus eſt idem, qui fuit ante, mihi for euer; ſtrong in weakeneſſe, and able, as I ſaid before, to match a Kings Scepter with a ſticke, or a ſtaffe, or a ſtone, or a word, in the hand or mouth of one ſent and appointed by him vnto his Glory. Bleſſed be his Maieſtie for euermore for his goodneſſe: Amen. And, deare Lord, giue faith to depend vpon thée in all comfort, whenſoeuer thou calleſt to any duty, not looking to our ſelues, or ſecond meanes; but aboue al, and ouer all, at thy mightie Power, that ſhalt euer giue teſtimony, as in theſe examples, of thy ſtretched-out arme in the midſt of weakenes &amp; contemptible ſhew, to effect thy Wil. Bleſſed is that man, ſaith ye kingly Prophet, Dauid, Whoſe ſtrength is the Lord, and in whoſe heart are thy waies. I wil loue thee deerely, O Lord, my ſtrength. For thou art my Rocke and my fortreſſe, and he that deliuereth me, my God and my might, my ſhielde and my buckler, the horne of my ſaluation and my refuge, 
                        Pſal. 18 1. 2. 
                        in thee will I truſt. &amp;c. Goe wee, then, forth, if the Lord ſo call, againſt the States of this earth, armed but in ſhewe, as Moſes was, or little Dauid: and we ſhall taſte the ſtrength of the Lord, to his glorie and our comfort, as they did.
                     8. And the Lord ſaid vnto Moſes, when thou art entred and come into Egypt againe, ſee that thou doe all the wonders before Pharaoh, which I haue put in thy hand: but I will harden his heart, and he ſhall not let the people goe. This was done that the Tyrant might ſée by theſe mightie workes, how hée had not to doo with man, but with God, and ſo be voyde and naked of all excuſe. But

This, that the Lord ſaith, Hee will harden his hart, troubleth ſome: and they ſéeke to temper it according to their fancies, leſt it ſhould ſéeme iniuſtice in the Lord; firſt, to harden, and then deſtroy: not remembring what the Apoſtle ſaith. God will haue mercy, on whom hee will haue mercy, and whom hee will, hee hardneth. And, if any obiect Exod. 33. 19. Rom. 9. 18. and ſay; why doth he, then, complaine? for who hath reſiſted his Will? His mouth is ſtopped by the ſame Apoſtle, in the ſame place, with this. O man, who art thou, that pleadeſt againſt God? Shall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, why haſt thou made me thus? Noting, that no reaſon is to be demaunded aboue Gods Will: for who will goe further, ſhall taſt the reward of his raſhnes, and the Maieſtie of God ſhall ouer-whelme him. Hath not the Potter power ouer the clay, to make of the ſame lumpe, one veſſell to honour, and another to diſhonour? And ſhall leſſe authoritie bee giuen to God? Aſke the Potter a reaſon, and it is but, his Will; and yet duſt and aſhes wil demaund more of God. Againe, if we be all of one Lumpe of corruption, (as wee muſt needes confeſſe wee are) if it pleaſe God to exempt ſome from the death due to ſo ſinfull wretches, dooth hée any wrong to others that hée vouchſafeth not the ſame vnto, leauing them but to their owne natures? No, he may doe with his owne as it pleaſeth him, and what hée dooth, ſtill is iuſt, holy and good. Let the wicked, then, accuſe themſelues, and not God: for ſtill in themſelues they ſhal finde the cauſe, if rightly they looke into their owne will.
                     9 It followeth in the Text: Then thou ſhalt ſay to Pharaoh, thus ſaith the Lord; Iſrael is my Sonne, euen my firſt borne. Wherefore, I ſay to thee, let my Sonne goe, that he may ſerue me: if thou refuſe to let him goe, beholde, I will ſlay thy Sonne, euen, thy firſt borne. Marke then How God calleth his church. the Title God giueth to his Church, and meditate on it earneſtlie. Hée calleth it, his Sonne, yea, his firſt borne noting therein, to all fleſh, that it is to him as a man-childe

to the Father, yea, as the firſt borne, which, commonly, is loued moſt tenderly, and in greateſt honour. Now then, thinke with your ſelfe, what heart is in you to the fruite of your body, and to your firſt borne: thinke, how you could endure to ſtand and looke vpon the abuſe offered by any to the whole or any parte; as, to ſée but a legge or an arme cut-off iniuriouſlie by bloody butchers; and then, thinke of God to his Church, and euery part of it: whoſe affection ſo-much excelleth yours, as God excelleth man; and holineſſe and perfection, miſery, ſinne and corruption. What a comfort is this, when the Deuill roareth, and Tyrants (his inſtruments) rage, breathing-out blood at their noſtrils, and nothing but death and deſtruction at their mouthes, with furious phraſes and ſpéeches of pride, as though there were none that could ſtop them, or controle them in what they will. Thinke on the difference of GOD and man in this point; that many harmes may be done to our Sons and our firſt borne, which wée ſée not, neither know of, and therefore at the inſtant féele not any touch for it or by it: But God ſéeth euer and euery where all actions, all intendments and purpoſes, all thoughts and ſecret attempts whatſoeuer, and ſtill is aboue man in his tenderneſſe of loue to his ſons &amp; children, as far as God excelleth duſt and earth and ſinne and corruption, as I ſaide. O, what a touch giue theſe raging cruelties, then, againſt his Church vnto him? what a féeling hath hée of them, and how doo they pierce his gratious bowels, wherein he hath wrapped-vp his people as his Sonnes and as his firſt borne? Still thinke of your ſelfe, what heart would be in you, and then try the difference of God and you. But, you will ſay vnto mée, it is comfortable to conſider this tender loue that you note indéede: but why then doth God ſuffer ſuch iniuries and oppreſſions, béeing able to auert them, as man is not, for the moſt part. This is the loue of a Father, that he neither can ſée nor ſuffer to be done to the childe hée loueth any outrage and crueltie, his power

béeing able to ſaue his childe from it. To which if I anſwere, I muſt pray you to continue euen ſtill in your owne reſemblance, and to tell me if you dayly ſée not moſt tender Fathers perceiuing cauſe for a further good, to ſuffer their children to lie in priſon, to bée toſſed in lawe, to bée ſchooled many wayes by ſuffering want and biting vpon ye bridle for a time; &amp; yet in ye midſt of al theſe things haue an eye to them, a loue to them and aſetled purpoſe, (when they know themſelues &amp; their ſtrength, the world &amp; his practiſes, men and their humors, and many ſuch things, not otherwiſe of many well learned, often, but by theſe meanes,) then to ſet-hand-to &amp; to helpe them; that then a loue may bée knowne a loue, and a good a good, with a liuely taſte, in compariſon of that which would haue béene, if ſooner the Father or friend had ſtepped in. So, ſo is it with the Lord for our capacitie, (though indéede no compariſon betwixt Him and vs.) Hée knoweth his times and turnes and our wants perfectlie, fitting the one to the other moſt mercifully, that both onr corruption and his goodneſſe may beſt appeare to the greateſt benefit vnto vs. Therefore let him alone in his own waies, &amp; tarrie we, as the Pſal. ſaith, his bleſſed leaſure, Be ſtrong, and he ſhall comfort our 
                        Pſal. 27. 14▪
                         
                        hearts, &amp; put we our truſt euer in him. Of the earthly father or friend the Prouerbe ſaith; wel he may ſée his childe or kinſman neede, but he cannot endure to ſee him bleede. So our ſweete God, wel he may ſee vs humbled, &amp; ſchooled and tamed &amp; wained from the loue of this wretched world, but vndone &amp; caſt away finally &amp; for euer, he cannot endure it, he will not ſuffer it, he will not ſée it. O, bleſſed bée his Name for euer &amp; euer for it. Haue this in your remembrāce therfore as a ſwéete Comfort, the occaſion of this Note. Iſrael is my Son, euen my firſt borne. And therefore, tell Pharaoh, 
                        ver. 22. 23. he were beſt take héede what he doth; for I will make his Sonne and firſt borne féele it, if he hinder mine, and will not let them go to ſerue me. The world you know contemneth &amp; deſpiſeth vs, counting vs ye refuſe of the people,

and what may bee baſe or vile: but this loue is life, and this regarde with God, is honour moſt high: in the comfort whereof, we may ſup-vp theſe earthly ſcornes, if his Grace bée with vs. The Prophet Eſay, in his ſpirit taſted this, when ſo ſwéetely hee prophecied and publiſhed (to this day to bée ſéene and heard) Thus ſaith the 
                        Eſay. 43. 1. 
                        Lord that cretaed thee, O Iacob, and he that formed thee, O Iſrael, Feare not: for I haue redeemed thee, I haue called thee by thy name; thou art mine. When thou paſſeſt through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the floudes, that thy doo not ouerflow thee: when thou walkeſt through the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt, neither ſhall the flame kindle vpon thee. For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Iſrael, thy Sauiour: I gaue Egypt for thy ranſome, Ethiopia and Seba for thee, &amp;c. reade the Chap. your ſelfe, and I ſtay héere.
                     10. Now ſée an Accident in the way. When Moſes 
                        verſe. 24. 
                        was in his Inne, the Lord met him, and would haue killed him. That is, by either a ſore ſickeneſſe, or ſome other way, the Lord made him know his wrath conceined againſt him; as alſo the cauſe, to wit, the omitting of the circumſicion of his Sonne, as by the euent wée may ſée; although it bee not expreſly named. Where, to our profit, let vs ſtay a while, and conſider diuers things. Firſt, why Moſes, ſo well acquainted with the law of God in this behalfe, ſhould omit or neglect to do it. And, for anſwere herevnto, marke with your ſelfe, how, of two ſonnes which Moſes had, and carried with him, the circumciſion of one is onely here mentioned: whereby you may well ſee, the other was before, and alreadie circumciſed, or elſe Gods wrath would not haue ſtayed in this place, vpon performance of dutie onely to one. Now, the one hauing before beene circumciſed, why ſhould he not haue done the like to the other, but that (out of all queſtion,) his wife, béeing not ſonndly perſwaded in this point, tooke offence at the firſt, grew vnquiet, offered vnfit ſpeathes, and happely

ſtirred vp her father alſo, Iethro, to ioine with her to rattle Moſes for ſuch crueltie (as they eſtéemed it) to his ſonne. Wherupon, the good man, milde &amp; ſoft of ſpirit, in humane frailety choſe rather to forbeare the ſecond ſon to haue his peace, than to circumciſe alſo him, and pleaſe God. A notable example to teach vs this doctrine; how néedefull it is euen to the great Doctours and Diuines, to the great Maſters and Teachers, and rulers and leaders of others, ſtill and continualy to be vnderpropped and held-vp by Gods powrefull ayde and bleſſed Spirit, in their duties: when as, otherwiſe, euen they, they, I ſay, that ſeeme ſo ſtrong, play Moſes part here, and faint in the way, to the offence of God, and danger of themſelues. Nay, if Moſes faint, how much more fall they flat downe, that neuer had ſuch meaſure of grace, as Moſes had? Pray therefore, and pray continually for increaſe of ſtrength, for courage and fortitude, for conſtancy and power, to repell al the darts, that Sathan ſhall throw at vs: and prepare we to buckle with men and women and Diuels that ſhal aſſay to quench or to coole our zeale in our places, and to bring vs to omit this, and that, and euerie day ſomewhat which God expreſly requireth, and will not abide to be omitted. See, you Diſcouragers and diſcomforters of Gods ſeruants, in neceſſarie duties, what venome is in your darts, and poyſon in yonr doings. Moſes (this great man) is ouercome and brought into daunger by them; and, O, how ſhal athouſand others of farre weaker ſtrength be turned out of the way, by you? Will God be angry with Moſes for yéelding? and ſhall you ſafely eſcape, that are the cauſes of his ſinne, the cut-throates of his zeale, and the ouer-turners of his well doing? No, no, aſſure your ſelues the wrath of the Lord ſhal conſume you, when it hath profitably corrected his childe, vnleſſe you repent and leaue-off ſuch Deuilliſh dealing. Sée you alſo, you brawling and vnquiet women, what your ignorance and obſtinacie bringeth your huſbands vnto, though they be (as Moſes) holy and vertuous?

they cannot ſerue God a-right for you, they cannot doe what God requireth but you breake their hearts, you coole their zeale, you turne them out of the way, and in the end you bring them to a fearefull danger of Gods deſtroying of them. For the Lord met Moſes héere, and would haue killed him, ſaith the Text. Shall this euer be vnpuniſhed verſe. 24. in you? no; your Huſbands ſhall bee ſchooled for their frailtie, and you ſhall be conſumed for your arrogancie, ſo proudly and ſo diſobediently contemning both their religious inſtructions, and holy actions. If God be in you, this will be a warning.
                     11. Then Zipporah tooke a ſharpe knife, &amp; cut away the fore-skin of her Sonne. The two things that héere might verſe. 25. be conſidered, (namely, that doctrine of Poperie concerning the danger of children dying vnbaptized, and ſecondlie of ſuch an abſolute neceſſitie of Baptiſme, as that women muſt adminiſter it in time of ſuppoſed néede) I forbeare to ſtand vpon now: I haue ſufficiently touched them in my Notes vpon Geneſis. Therefore doo but remember with your ſelfe (touching the firſt) that wee make a great difference betwixt want of the Sacrament, and contempt of the ſame; contempt, damning; and want, not, through the ſtrength of Gods promiſe; meaning, by want, when God ſo preuenteth by death, that it cannot be had, according to the manner allowed in the word. And, touching the ſecond, obſerue, that this act of Zipporah, here, in circumciſing her childe, was méerely extraordinarie, and doth no way warrant women to baptize now-a-daies. Her bitter words to her huſband (that hee was a bloodie husband to her) ſhewe but what ſpéeches are often giuen by women that haue their tongues a little too much at liberty. His wiſedome, in not anſwering her, is to this day his praiſe; and her fact, her fault, in ſo vndutifully ſpeaking. Let this ſuffice of this Chapter: and nowe reade the Text ouer in your Bible, and ſée how theſe Notes haue helped you. My drift you ſée, and I leaue it to God. I would haue all men encouraged to reade.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. 5.
                     
                        The chiefe Heads of this Chapter are theſe.

                              The comming of Moſes &amp; Aaron to the King.
                              The greeuanees of the people.
                              Their impatiencie.
                           
                        
                     
                     1. TOuching the firſt, héere wee ſée, that, although Moſes was very backward a-while to obey God and goe to this King vpon this errand; yet at laſt hee yéelded: faith ouercame feare, and all conceits ſteeped to the obedience of God. A happie thing! and happie is that man and woman euer, which can likewiſe ſay truly; I haue had my feares and fancies, my errors and mine ignorances, my pride and my preiudice againſt that which was good and right; but they are all gone (I thanke God,) and I much ioy that they are gone, as likewiſe that I am now ſincerely his whoſe I ought to be, and in this obedience doe not doubt but ſhall end my dayes, by his grace.
                     2. Wée may againe thinke héere, why God ſhould thus ſend Moſes and Aaron to pray deliuerance for his people, when hee was able without ſtretched arme to haue deliuered them at his pleaſure? And wee may aunſwere our ſelues in this ſort, euen for the reaſons following, and ſuch like. Firſt, that theſe ſundry bickerings with this Tyrant for his Church might notablie ſhewe his loue and affection to his Church, which is euery mans great and ſpeciall comfort. Secondly, that patience might be taught by this Example to all Gods children, if their troubles and oppreſſions receaue not an end by and by. Thirdly, hee thus taketh

all excuſe from this obſtinate enemie; (a thing of good vſe, if wee obſerue it.) For euen as héere by Moſes and Aaron the Lord dealt wich Pharaoh; ſo by his Miniſters ſtill the Lord dealeth with vs: leauing vs as naked without excuſe, if wee continue diſobedient, as euer hee did Pharaoh. Fourthly, hee thus diſcouered the great darknes of our vnderſtanding vntill it be lightned, and the damnable waywardnes of our will, till it be changed by him. Fiftly and laſtly, by this manifeſting of the enemies malice, he openeth (to our vnſpeakeable comfort, and ſo of his Church vnto the end) what a victorious hand hee hath to ſaue and deliuer when and whom hee ſhall euer pleaſe, be the rage neuer ſo ſtrong and great. For Pharaoh cannot hold out, but whileſt God will, we ſée héere; no more ſhall any Tyrant to the worlds end. Thus you ſée, why God vſed this way, by meſſage and entreatie, rather than the other, by his power and might. Let it profit you, and ſo I leaue it.
                     3. You ſée alſo héere againe, how God calleth them his people, although oppreſſed and in miſerie vnder a wicked, wayward, and prophane Gouernour. It is a ſwéete comfort to thoſe that taſt of like griefe; and ſheweth, as I haue noted before, that affliction ſeperateth not from God: but in the midſt of all woe, hee regardeth, and ſaith, mine, mine; although inſtantly hee rebuke not either winde or weather, &amp;c.
                     4. Pharaoh, his proude anſwere, ſaying, Who is the Lord, that I ſhould heare him? pictureth out the hardnes of an vnregenerate hart, and biddeth all beholders to pray againſt it. O duſt and aſhes, dareſt thou ſay thou knoweſt not him that made thée, and not tremble for thy ignorance? This vnféelingnes was in Pilate, when hee ſaid: what is truth? And what is that which ſome amongſt vs vtter euery day, what new doctrine is this? Sed non impunè recuſat Pharaoh quod ſcienter ignorat. But, to his woe doth Pharaoh refuſe what wittingly and willingly he knoweth

not. And ſo ſhall all that delight in ignorance. Hence commeth waywardnes and wilfulnes, obſtinacie and frowardnes, rage and madnes, that men will not heare and know. But in Pharaoh ſée what will followe one day, when by voice and words no good is done. Hée in the Sea, thou in the lake that euer burneth ſhalt periſh and ſinke to eternall confuſion.
                     5. I will not let them goe, ſaith hee. Then, his reaſon is, his Will; euer the refuge of the Reprobate. I will not; I will not; and ſtill in the end, I will not. A ſhort reſolution, but as dangerous a reſolution as man can make againſt his owne ſoule, many times. In the 6. of Ieremie, ſée the like anſwere. Wee will not walke therein. Againe, in the 44. Chap. The word that thou haſt ſpoken to vs, in the name of the Lord, wee will not heare it of thee, &amp;c. And many moe like anſweres there be in the Scriptures; but whoſe bee they? euen ſuch, I ſay, as rebell againſt God and his good motiues made to them by his Miniſters and meanes wiſhing them well. Wherefore the end is Gods wrath vpon them, and fearefull deſtruction. Such anſweres wee heare too often amongſt our ſelues, ſaying; I am ſetled, &amp;c. and I wil not heare you. God graunt in any due time wee may learne by other mens harmes, and leaue them. For true and true ſhall wee finde that S. Auguſtine ſaith, Religio ſtulta non prodest, ſed obest. A fooliſh Religion doth not profit, but hurt: and God is iuſt to all men in his time, I meane, in puniſhing their proude diſobedience. This is confirmed euen in that which followeth in the next verſe in theſe words: Leſt hee bring vpon vs the peſtilence or ſword. Noting, that this is euer the end of the contempt of diuine worſhip, according to the preſcript of God, ſome fearefull plague and iudgement. Surely, this one place would ſuffice to many to awake them, and ſhall no places profit vs? Were this people of Iſrael in danger, and wee in none? haue wee the Lord bound, that wee may doe what wee liſt, and yet be ſafe?

If they goe not out to ſacrifice to the Lord, that is, to ſerue and worſhip him in that ſort and manner that then hee commaunded, the Lord will bring vpon them the peſtilence or ſword; and if wee ſtiflie and ſtubbornly, proudly and preſumptuouſlie refuſe to goe out but of our doores to the Church by vs to ſerue him as now hée commaundeth, ſhal nothing followe? God touch vs, and moue vs; the knife is vpon our throates, and wee feare not. Whole houſes and Manors are rooted out and ruinated, not only abroade in the Land, but euen in the Country (peraduenture where wee dwell) for this rebellion; and yet wee thinke our poſteritie ſhall abide and nothing happen vpon our heapings for them, when hee is deſpiſed that doth but blowe vpon lands and liuings and they are gone. Cathedram in Coelo habet, qui corda mouet. His chaire is in Heauen, that moueth harts:
                         and hee, for his mercie ſake, I ſay againe, moue vs, that wee may enquire, ſéeke and ſée whether wee doo well, or wrong, and doo as wee ought, when wee ſée it. The Lord hath promiſed to take away the ſtonie hart and to giue a fleſhie in the place, if wee will vrge him with his promiſe by humble, hartie and earneſt prayer. So did Dauid, when hee cried; O, let mee feele, let mee feele, knowing euen then, that this Gods mercie, if it were Pſal. 51. ſought, ſhould be graunted.
                     6. Then ſaid the King of Egypt vnto them, Moſes and 
                        verſe. 4. 
                        Aaron, why cauſe yee the people to ceaſe frō their workes, &amp;c? Sée the lot of the Juſt; to be quarrelled with, nipped, quipped, ſlaundred, and euen laden many times with falſe and moſt iniurious imputations. To Prophets, Apoſtles, 
                        Incurious imputations. 
                        Martyrs, and Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, this meaſure hath béene meaſured, and they haue borne it. Deus videt, the Lord ſeeth,
                         and in his due time hee will make the truth appeare. Fero, ſpero; I endure, and hope;
                         let it bee thy Meditation when none ſéeth but hee that ſéeth in ſecret. Againe, marke héere, how, when God draweth néere to yéeld vs comfort, then Sathan in his members rageth more, and ſéeketh to

encreaſe our troubles, ſorrowes and griefes: but yet all in vaine, God in the end will deliuer his Seruants in deſpite of all their enemies, as here he did. Be of good comfort, and lay it vp in thy hart.
                     7. They be idle, therefore they crie, ſaying, Let vs goe 
                        Ver. 8. 
                        to offer ſacrifice, &amp;c. A truth it is, that nothing is worſe than Idlenes, the mother of all vice; as, diſcord, ſlaunder, and ſlaughter, and ſuch like: but that heere they were idle, was an error in the King, and a malicious lie in thoſe that ſo enformed him. By which wee may learne and ſée, how wicked men haue no eyes, often, to ſée the true cauſes of a thing, but moſt apt and readie to deuiſe a falſe. Let a man or woman be gréeued extraordinarily with the burthen of their ſinnes, and with groanes and ſighes trauaile vnder the bitternes of it, leauing thereupon thoſe recreations which erſt they vſed, and delighted in, what ſay the wicked? oh, it is a melancholie, and the body would be purged, &amp;c. But, oh, they are blinde and haue no eye-ſight into the combates of the godly, may wee truly ſay, and ſo leaue them. Feſtus imagineth Paul is mad, when he ſpeaketh the words 
                        Act. 26. 24. 
                        of truth and ſobernes: and that much learning maketh him mad, when learning is wiſedome, and maketh wiſe. Yea, Heli himſelfe miſtaketh Anna, a vertuous woman, 1. Sam. 2. and déemeth her to be drunke; when rauiſhed in her holy féeling, ſhee was crying to GGD with feruent prayer. Wherefore, the Apoſtle teacheth, To the end Chriſt might 
                        Heb. 2. 17. 
                        be mercifull, &amp; a faithfull high Prieſt in things concerning God, it behooued him in all things to be made like vnto his brethren. And, in another place, Wee haue not an 
                        Chap. 4. 14 
                        high Prieſt, that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all things tempted in like ſort, yet without ſinne, &amp;c.
                     
                     8. And let them not regard vaine words, ſaith Pharaoh. 
                        Ver. 9. Such taſte and ſuch conceipt haue vaine perſons, of Gods word. In the 14. of the Acts, the truth of God, you knowe, is called, Hereſie, of the wicked: And, in the 17.

Chapter it is called, Newe, of vaine Phyloſophers that knewe not what it was. Examples of vſe, to giue vs contentment in patience, when like ignorance in our dayes bringeth forth like blaſphemies. Be ſtayed &amp; ſtrong.
                     9. Then went the Taske-maiſters of the people, and 
                        verſe, 10. 
                        their Officers out, and tolde the people, ſaying, Thus ſaith Pharaoh, I will giue you no more ſtraw. Goe your ſelues, 
                        11. 
                        get you ſtraw where ye can finde it, yet ſhall nothing of your labour be diminiſhed. Then were the people ſcattered, 
                        12. 
                        &amp;c. Sée againe what was ſaid before, how the néerer that God draweth to his Church and Children to doo them good, the more rageth Sathan, in and by his members, againſt them. Hard, hard therefore are the beginnings of deliuerance out of Egypt, ſpirituall Egypt I meane, as well as out of this earthly Egypt. And therefore, when the Lord ſhall touch thy hand, and open thine eyes to ſée where thou art, how farre out of the way that leadeth to eternall life, and giue thée a deſire to returne and be ſaued, Remember what the wiſe-man ſaith, and bee comforted with it. My Sonne, if thou wilt come into the ſeruice of GOD, ſtand faſt in righteouſnes and feare, and prepare 
                        Ezcleſ. 2. 1. 
                        thy ſoule to temptation, &amp;c. Reade the place to the ende. Remember that Example in the Goſpell, how the foule Mark. 9. 26. ſpirit being commaunded to depart, rent and tare the partie more and worſe than euer before. Wee cannot leaue anie ſinne wherein wee haue continued, but by and by ſome contrarie winde will blowe, and wee ſhall be diſcouraged, if it may be, ſomtimes with threatnings and bitter words, ſometimes with ſhew of perils and loſſes that may enſue, ſometimes with mocks and taunts in very ſpightfull manner; and in a word, if wee haue done euill, wee muſt doo euill ſtill, and ſo be caſt away, or elſe Sathan will want his will: But be ſtrengthened with this Example and others in the Word. Here, now, their burthen and miſerie is greater than euer before. For, now, they muſt haue no more ſtraw, but gather it where they can; and yet make

vp the tale and number of their bricke before: which was a great extremitie, yet the end is ſtill as the Lord hath decréed: his purpoſe is to deliuer them from this ſlauerie: and, when his time commeth, they ſhall bee deliuered, and let goe, whoſoeuer ſaith, nay. Though diſcomfort encreaſe for a little while, to drawe ſighes out of the heart, to him that can helpe; yet, it ſhall end with ioyfull comfort put in the place of it, and ſo much the ſooner, by how much it groweth the ſharper. O, ſtand then, and ſhrinke not; and ſay in your heart, now, now is my God at hand. For now I féele and ſée the enemie maddeſt to oppreſſe me, if hee could. Come, therefore, ſwéete Lord, I humbly beſéech thée; ſtay not; and, till thou commeſt, vouchſafe thy hand to ſtay me, that I faint not. Thou art ſtrong, and I am weake; thou art good, and I am bad; but thou art mine, and I am thine. O Bleſſed, Bleſſed, ſupport thine owne, that I may euer praiſe thée.
                     10. And the Taske-maſters haſted them, ſaying; Finiſh 
                        verſe. 13. 14. 15. 
                        your dayes-worke, &amp;c. And they beate them. Then they cried to Pharaoh, &amp;c. A Storie to ſhew you, if you note it, how the Law worketh without the Goſpel; euen roughlie, &amp; ſharply, and rigorouſlie. For, doo this, doo this; &amp; finiſh finiſh the work, is ſtil the voice of it. Whereby ſin and the Deuill rageth as here Pharaoh doth. For, ſinne, ſaith 
                        Rom. 7. 8. 9. 10 
                        the Apoſtle, tooke occaſion by the law, &amp;c. So, ſinne reuiued, But I died: and the ſame commaundement, which was ordained vnto life, was found to be vnto mee vnto death, &amp;c. Then crieth the true Iſraelite, O wretched 
                        24. 
                        man that I am! who ſhall deliuer me from the body of this death? as heere they cried vnto Pharaoh, to bee deliuered from their miſerie. Bleſſed therefore bee the Lord for his ſwéete Goſpell, which helpeth all this rigour, and giueth vs comfort and deliuerance in his Sonne, from this great rage to our endleſſe comfort. Sée alſo, how Tyrannie once begunne, encreaſeth more and more from words to blowes: verſe. 14. And, when they crie vnto Pharaoh, in

hope of remedie, verſe, 15. ſhewing him the iniquitie of their vſage; and, how their offence, in not making vp their tale of bricke, grew by other mens faults, that gaue them no ſtraw, verſe, 16: this pittifull complaint which ſhould Ver. 16 haue moued him to commiſeration, worketh but a confirmation of tyrannie in the wicked King: firſt, mocking and ſcoffing at their Religion, (as wicked men vſe to doo) verſe, 17, and vttering his crueltie with his owne mouth, There 
                        Ver. 17 Ver. 18. 
                        ſhall no ſtraw be giuen you, yet ſhal you deliuer the whole tale of Bricke, ver. 18. Wherefore, how happie Kingdomes be, to which the Lord hath graunted mercifull and gracious Princes, full of pittie and clemencie, flowing from a true taſte of holy Religion, and from an immoueable loue of their true Subiects, I leaue the Reader, if he haue any bowels in him, to féele, and conſider; ſending vp his thanks where it is due, for what hee enioyeth in abundant meaſure.
                     11. Then the Officers of the Children of Iſrael ſaw thē
                           ſelues 
                        Ver. 19. Ver. 20. 
                        in an euill caſe, &amp;c. And they met Moſes and Aaron, who ſtoode in their way as they came out from Pharaoh. To whom they ſaid, the Lord looke vpon you, and iudge, 
                        Ver. 21. 
                        for ye haue made our ſauour to ſtinke before Pharaoh, and before his Seruants, in that ye haue put a ſword in their hands to ſley vs. A third euent of the ambaſſage of Moſes and Aaron is, this bitter expoſtulation of theſe Officers: wherein, as in a glaſſe moſt bright and cleare, you ſée the condition and lot of faithfull Miniſters in this wretched world. Firſt, the King, and now the people accuſe them as worthie of great reproofe (both gréeuous to good minds:) but eſpeciallie, to be accuſed of their brethren, when they doo as their dutie requireth, O, it is double gréeuous, and euer was. But thus was it euer, and will bee euer: and therefore, praemonitus praemunitus, forewarned forearmed,
                         and, praeuiſaiacula minus feriunt; Darts eſpied before they come hurt leſſe.
                         God giue vs patience &amp; loue ſtill to them that loue not vs. Heere, is great bitternes (and yet vndeſerued)

in this their ſpéech, if you marke it; and heere is great inconſtancie, compared with the Chapter before, where they worſhipped, and welcommed theſe happy Meſſengers of a gracious God, who ſaw their oppreſſion and miſerie, and ſent to helpe them. But, quae nocent docent, 
                        Schola crucis ſchola lucis. 
                        things hurtfull inſtruct and giue wiſedome. While all is well, good is the Miniſter; and when the croſſe commeth, he and his doctrine (though the truth of God is cauſe of all) away with that, and away with him. The word which thou haſt ſpoken to vs in the name of the Lord, wee will 
                        Ier. 44. 16, &amp;c. 
                        not heare it of thee. But wee will doo whatſoeuer thing goeth out of our owne mouth, as to burne Incenſe to the Queene of Heauen, and to poure out drinke offerings vnto her, as we haue done, both we &amp; our Fathers, our Kings, and our Princes in the Cities of Iuda, and in the ſtreetes of Ieruſalem: (now marke their reaſon) for then had wee plenty of victuals, and were well, and felt no euill. But, ſince we left off to burne Incenſe to the Queene of Heauen, and to poure out drinke offerings vnto her, we haue had ſcarcenes of all things, and haue beene conſumed by the ſword, and by famine. This is the ſtay of the multitude, and this is the line they meaſure all things by, their proſperitie in worldly matters, and immunitie from trouble and affliction any wayes. But it is a crooked rule, if we hearken to God, and he that will followe him, muſt take vp his croſſe and followe him, when his good pleaſure ſhal be ſo. Take héede alſo by theſe mennes examples, to expect deliuerance from any calamitie ſooner and faſter than God pleaſeth. For, becauſe of this, they breake out in this ſort againſt Gods Seruants: they will not tarie the leaſure of God, but when themſelues will, and as they wil, they muſt be deliuered. A dangerous dealing, and no way fit for them that are ſéekers and crauers.
                     12. Wherefore Moſes returned to the Lord, and ſaid, 
                        ver. 22. 
                        Lord, why haſt thou afflicted this people? wherefore haſt thou thus ſent me? For, ſince I came to Pharaoh to ſpeake 
                        23.
                        
                        in thy Name, he hath vexed this people, and yet thou haſt not deliuered thy people. Sée, ſée the right remedie in all affliction, euen to returne vnto the Lord, as Moſes did here. For, he woundeth and he healeth, hee killeth and he maketh 
                        1. Sam. 2. 6. 
                        aliue, he bringeth downe to the graue and raiſeth vp againe. But, Moſes manner of returning with ſuch expoſtulations, here, is not to be commended: for hee pleadeth with the Lord, as though hee did contrarie to his promiſe, becauſe as yet there appeared no fruite of his ambaſſage. He alſo complaineth, as though his calling were in vaine, ſince worſe &amp; worſe was the condition of the people from his firſt comming. Wherefore ſée and marke the weakenes of the ſtrongeſt ſometimes, and eſpeciallie when of ſuch they are vexed as they haue deſerued well, and indéede ſhould receiue a kinder courſe frō them. O gall of friends, how bitter art thou? how ſtrikeſt thou to the very bottome of a fleſhie heart, and leaueſt a ſting behinde thée, that killeth with the poyſon and venome of it, if God ſuccour not? Neither the furie of Pharaoh, nor the crueltie of the Egyptians moued Moſes any thing: but, his owne to wrong him, whoſe good hee ſought, and with all perill to himſelfe endeauoured, it moueth him ſo, that his weakenes breaketh out euen before his God. This ſhould moue men, and all that looke to be liked and liue with God, to forbeare and flie from the like vnkindnes toward thoſe whom God hath ſent to them for their good: and this muſt remember ſuch meſſengers to pray for ſtrength; and as Moſes yet forſooke not his Office for all this, ſo neither they to doe; but ſtill going on, to expect the Lords mercy which here to Moſes now ſhewed it ſelfe, and gaue him comfort, as followeth in the next Chapter.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. 6.
                     
                        
                           The parts of this Chapter are two.
                           
                              Firſt, a repetition of things done before, from the 1. verſe to the 12.
                              Secondly, a ſhort Storie, by way of digreſſion, of the names and families of the Iſraelites, from the 12. verſe to the end of the Chapter.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        1. TThen, for vſe of this Chapter, let vs conſider theſe wordes of the Lord, ver. 3: And I appeared to Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob, by the 
                           ver. 3. 
                           Name of Almightie God: but by my Name Iehouah was I not knowne vnto them: and vnderſtand the true ſence and meaning of them. Wherein wee may not thinke that this name Iehouah was vnknowne before this time, (for expreſlie hee named himſelfe thus to Abraham, Gen. 15. 7. and to Iacob, Gen. 28. 13. as alſo in the 26. ver. 24. where Iacob prayed vnto the Lord by this Name:) But the Lords meaning is, by this kinde of ſpéech to prefer, by way of compariſon, this manifeſtation of himſelfe which now he entended to make, before all others made to the Fathers in former times, becauſe thoſe contained but promiſes, this ſhould haue the effect and performance of the promiſes: ſo as the words are, as if the Lord ſhould haue ſaid; I appeared to Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob, by the name of Almightie God: that is, I gaue them promiſes which they by faith laide hold on and beléeued, moued with the aſſurance they had of my Almightie power and all-ſufficiencie: but by my name Iehouah,
                            
                           Iehoua, qui est, et eſſe facit quod promiſit. 
                           was I not knowne vnto them: that is, I gaue them not the accompliſhment and matter of my promiſe, as now

at this time I will doo to you. For now as my Name Iehouah ſignifieth an exiſtence by my ſelfe, of whō, in whom, by whom, and for whom, whatſoeuer is, is, and hath being: ſo ſhall you ſée it come to paſſe in your Deliuerance from this raging Tyrant, and cruell bondage. I will performe what I haue ſaid, and I will now cauſe it to be, what heretofore I haue onely ſaid ſhould be. S. Bernard hath a good Saying touching this matter, when hee teacheth vs thus; That the calling of God by ſeuerall Names, as Father, Maiſter, or (as here) Almightie, Iehouah, and the like, ariſeth not of any varietie in his Nature, which euer was, and ſhall be inuariable; but of and from a manifold varietie of affections in vs, according to a diuers profiting, or not profiting of our ſoules, whereby hee ſéemeth to be changed with vs that change. So may I profit in the way of Godlines, that his Name toward me may be a Father; and ſo may I not profit, as his Name may be a Judge, a Reuenger mightie and terrible, &amp;c.
                        2. Let vs obſerue theſe words, ver. 5. I haue heard the groaning of the children of Iſrael, whom the Egyptians 
                           verſe. 5. 
                           keepe in bondage, &amp;c. Are they not ſwéete and comfortable? Miſerable man remembreth and heareth his friends when they are in proſperitie, and if aduerſitie come vnto them, neither hearing nor ſéeing then, but a proude, ſcornefull, and bitter forgetting. The Lord is not ſo; but when wee are at the worſt, then he remembreth vs, then hee heareth our groanes and ſighes, and pittying helpeth, to our vnſpeakeable comfort. O kinde, O gracious and déere God, ſtill continue this eare of mercie towards thy poore afflicted Seruants, and giue that deliuerance, eaſe, and fréedome, that euer, euer may bee matter of thy praiſe to all ſuccéeding learners, how ſwéete thy nature is. Amen. Amen.
                        
                        3 Alſo, I will take you for my people, &amp;c. Behold the ver. 7. end of all deliuerance, and of all benefites receiued from God, euen that wee ſhould be his people, that hee might

rule in vs &amp; ouer vs, and his praiſe be euer in our mouthes. Wherefore ſée how carefull wee ſhould be alwaies to anſwere this our Calling, and neuer to be found vnmindfull of ſuch fauours. For, if this plainer manifeſtation of his goodnes to them, more than to their fathers, was matter to them iuſtly to ſtir them vp to thankfull féeling; how much more ſhould his manifeſtation of himſelfe to vs in his owne Sonne, in whom he hath opened all the treaſures of mercie and louing kindnes, moue vs to an eternall and neuer ceaſing care to pleaſe him, ſerue him, honour him, and loue him? And then more perticularly, that hee ſhould accept me, me, for one of his people, O, what can I ſay for ſuch a loue, but beſéech him euer to make me thankfull? Amen, Amen.
                        
                        4. And I will bring you into the Land which I ſware 
                           verſe. 8. 
                           that I would giue to Abraham, to Iſaac, and to Iacob, and I will giue it vnto you for a poſſeſſion: I am the Lord. Swéete &amp; comfortable was this promiſe, as often as God repeated it: but many were the difficulties that appeared to mens eies againſt this hope, all which how great ſo-euer or many, the Lord if you marke it, eaſeth with this one word, Ego Dominus, I am the Lord.
                            Thereby teaching, that as long as our hearts holde this perſwaſion of him, that hee is the Lord; ſo long wee muſt euer reſt aſſured without fearefull fainting, that hee can performe his promiſes in mercie made vnto vs, be there neuer ſuch ſtops and lets in our eyes. What then is thy caſe? are thy ſinnes many, and great? remember he is the Lord, and play not Cains part, to ſay, they cannot be forgiuen. Are thine enemies ſtrong and fierce, and bitterly bent againſt thée? Hée is the Lord, and therefore can ſtop and ſtay them, they ſhal not hurt thée aboue his pleaſure, which ſhall be no hurt, but profit to thée in the end. Are thine infirmities many? hee can heale them; hee is the Lord. Are thy children vntoward, or vnkinde? hee can change them; hee is the Lord. Finally, whatſoeuer gréeueth thée, remember this, and be

comforted; hee is the Lord, he ſhall euer be the Lord, and he ſhall euer be thy Lord to care for thy woes, and to ſend thée helpe. Onely beléeue.
                        5. So Moſes tolde the Children of Iſrael thus, but they hearkened not vnto him. Sée, ſée how hard it is, as your verſe. 9. Marginall Note ſaith to ſhewe true obedience vnder the Croſſe. Neither the word of God, nor his miracles, wherewith heretofore they iuſtly haue béene moued, and wondred, haue now any place with them; but all dulled and deaded with conceiued griefes, they ſuffer themſelues to be caried away beyond the meaſure that Gods children ſhould euer holde in their aduerſitie; which, as it is a very dangerous thing, ſo ought it carefully to be auoyded. It is often a penaltie that hee layeth vpon the contemners of his Graces, that cleauing altogether to the externall fauours and fawnings of this life, they taſte not comfort in any affliction; whereas the godly, the more they are preſſed and nipped by the ſchooling hand of their God, the more vehemently they ſigh vnto God, and looke to his promiſes with patience and hope. This may teach the Miniſters of God, alſo, not to be caſt downe, and diſcouraged, if their words euer be not hearkened vnto and regarded; ſince ſo worthie a man as Moſes was in the houſe of GOD found this meaſure. I knowe, I knowe the bitternes of it to a heart that hungreth for their good; but wee muſt bee content, wee are not like to them that haue ſpoken in vaine to deafe eares before wee were borne. The world will bee the world, crooked and croſſe, froward and vnkinde, though wee breake our hearts in labouring to winne to a better courſe. O, what a thing is it to come out of Egypt? &amp;c.
                        6. Thē the Lord ſpake vnto Moſes, ſaying, Goe ſpeake 
                           ver. 10. 
                           to Pharaoh King of Egypt, that he let the children of Iſrael goe out of his Land. Before you ſawe how he was bid goe to the people, now wee heare him ſent to Pharaoh: ſo is there neuer any time for men of place and publique function to be idle. Euer, euer, there is ſome ſeruice for them,

and an vſe of their care, paines, and labour. Now they muſt defend the oppreſſed and wronged, now they muſt puniſh the euill dooers, now they muſt comfort, now they muſt chide; that euer they may ſée and finde honour to bee a burthen and an vnceaſing carefulnes. Priuate men alſo may make vſe of it: for, either in flying euill or in doing good there is alwaies a care in good mindes. But I leaue it to your meditation. I note and ſée héere the bottomleſſe mercie of the Lord, who although he might iuſtly haue giuen ouer to fauour ſo froward a companie, that would not hearken to his words and meſſages ſent vnto them; yet he doth not, but ſtill continueth to haue mercy vpō them, verifying that ſpéech of the Prophet Dauid; Euen as a Father 
                           Pſal. 103. 
                           pittieth his children, ſo is the Lord mercifull to his people. I ſée it alſo héere (not without my good) that when Moſes had receiued this diſcomfort, that the people would not regard his wordes, and might ſtand in a maze what more to doe, the Lord helpeth him out of this doubt, and ſendeth him to Pharaoh. Surely, ſurely, if the Lord helped vs not in many mazes that this vnkinde world will driue vs into, it would be ill with vs. But bleſſed be God that yéeldeth both conſilium &amp; auxilium, counſell and helpe,
                            when we can doo neither our ſelues. Let it ſtrengthen vs to call vpon him in all our néedes: if ſome will not heare vs, he can ſend vs to others, and his will be done, ſay wee euer.
                        7. But Moſes ſpake vnto the Lord, ſaying, behold the 
                           verſe. 12. 
                           children of Iſrael harken not vnto me, how then ſhal Pharaoh heare me who am of vncircumciſed lips? Sée weaknes and wants in the beſt men ſtill. If Iſrael will not heare, hee thinketh it cannot be that Pharaoh ſhould heare; and a ſecond ſtop hee maketh his owne infirmitie of ſpéech. But what is not GOD able to doo that his pleaſure is to haue done? Can hee not make ſome heare what others would not? the Scripture and our experience are full of examples. The Niniuites, Ionas, 3. the Samaritanes, Iohn, 4.

then we may not at our ſelues ſo much, and what wee are in our ſelues and of our ſelues, as at the calling and Office committed to vs of God, whoſe power is euer able to make good his gracious Commiſſion vouchſafed to his creature, againſt all fighters and frowners, ſtriuers and ſpurners at it.

                           to deliuer thee, ſaith the Lord. The Prophet his feare appeareth before in the 6. ver; &amp; now this comfort drawn frō the authoritie &amp; function commited to him, muſt take away that feare, and giue him ſtrength and courage to doo what the Lord calleth him vnto. The like ſée in Ezechiel, when God ſaith vnto him, Sonne of man, Behold, I haue made 
                           Ezech. 3. 8. 
                           thy face ſtrong againſt their faces, and thy forehead hard againſt their foreheads. I haue made thy forehead as the Adamant, and harder than the flint; feare them not therefore, 
                           9 
                           neither be afraid at their lookes; for they are a rebellious houſe. At this day, the Lord doth giue to his Miniſters, the power to binde and looſe, and hath publiſhed this Spéech of vnſpeakeable comfort, He that receaueth you, receaueth me; and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me. All which both then and now had and muſt haue the vſe I named; euen, to draw men from them ſelues, and the regard of their owne power, to the conſideration of their places and offices vouchſafed of God, and of the ſtrength of him, who is all in all, and hath laid that charge vpon them. Not once did it enter into the Lords thought, to eſtabliſh hereby a Title to ye Biſhop of Rome, aboue all others to be called Deus in terris, a God on earth,
                            as his owne authentical &amp; allowed

                           nostrum Papam non poſſe ſtatuere pro vt ſtatuit, haereticum cenſeretur. To beleeue that our Lord God the Pope, may not decree as he decreeth, would be iudged hereſie. Such an impudent boldnes, as a man would not thinke any ſhould ſuffer, had not the Spirit of God foretold vs by his bleſſed Apoſtle, that the Man of ſinne ſhould ſit in the temple of 2. Theſſa. 2. God, and ſhew himſelfe as if he were God. Whereunto add that good Saying of S. Gregorie, who, writing of Antichriſt, Greg. in Iob. cap. 34. ſaith thus. Cum ſit damnatus homo &amp; nequaquam ſpiritus, Deum ſe eſſe mentitur. Whereas hee is a damned man and not a Spirit, by lying he feigneth himſelfe to be God. Alſo that of Anſelmus; Simulabit ſe religioſum, vt ſub

Antichriſt ſhall feigne himſelfe to be holy, that hee may deceaue men vnder the colour of holines; yea he ſhall call himſelfe God, and ſhall cauſe himſelfe to be worſhipped, and ſhall promiſe the kingdome of Heauen.
                            Thinges which wee all knowe the Pope doth, and no man euer but the Pope. And heare you what a Note Euſebius maketh of this; Hoc est argumentum 
                           Euſeb. de preparat. lib. 7.

                              diſſe Deum, quod velint ſeipſos appellari Deos. This is a token that they hate God, becauſe they will haue themſelues called by the name of God. Iraeneus
                            that auncient father ſaith, Antichristus exiſtens apostata et latro, quaſi Deus vult adorari; &amp; cum ſit ſeruus, regem vult ſe preconiari. Antichriſt being a Runagate and a thiefe, yet will be worſhipped as God; and being but a ſlaue, yet will be proclaimed and publiſhed as a King.
                            But you will imagine they haue ſome ſhift for this ſhame, or elſe it is too ſhamefull. Surely, all the ſhiftes they haue cannot make it otherwiſe than a moſt odious inſolencie, ſuch as might fully open mennes eyes, who are yet deceiued to diſcerne the errour of their courſe in following his law and loue againſt God, Prince, and Country, as many doo; but that the Lord being angrie with their contempt of his truth, letteth them ſtill remaine

in their blindnes, as a iust puniſhment of their frowardnes. Their ſhift is this, they doo not meane he is abſolutely God, but in ſome ſence or reſpect. For by their Gloſſe it is ſaid, Papa nec Deus, nec homo, The Pope is neither God, nor man.
                            And is not this a worthie qualification? Might not all thoſe, who (as vainely as he) haue challenged the Title in like ſort, defend it as he now dooth? Proud Antiochus, ſometime King of Syria, honoured Hierony. in Dan. 3. Suetonius in Domitiano. himſelfe by the name of God. So the Emperour Domitian vſed in his Proclamations, Dominus Deus vester Domitianus. Your Lord God Domitian.
                            So the Emperour Caligula called himſelfe Deum optimum maximum, &amp; Iouem Latialem. The beſt and moſt mighty God, and the

                           great Iupiter of Italy. So Sapores the great King of Perfia called himſelfe Fratrē Solis &amp; Lunae, The brother of the Sunne and the Moone.
                            The péeuiſh Phiſition Menecrates called himſelfe Iupiter. Nicagoras made himſelfe a paire of wings, and would néedes be called the God Mercurie. Manichaeus the Heretique called himſelfe the holy Ghoſt. The Romaines erected vp an Image in the honour of Simon 
                           Aug. contra Faustum lib. 13. cap. 17. Euſeb. lib. 2. cap. 13. 
                           Magus the Sorcerer, with this poeſie: Simoni ſancto Deo. To the honour of Simon the holy God.
                            And did all theſe well, if the diſtinction be added of God abſolute, and God not abſolute? I thinke not. Yet which of all theſe were comparaable to the Pope in this arrogant vanitie, conſidering the knowledge that he either hath, or ought to haue aboue them. Neuertheleſſe Pope Nicholas ſaide, Constat ſummū Pontificem a pio Principe Constantino Deum 
                           Dist. 96. ſatis euidenter. 
                           appellatum. It is well knowne, that of the godly Prince Conſtantine the Pope was called God.
                            So in the Counſell of Lateran, this proude Antichriſt ſuffered one of his Paraſites to ſay, Tu es alter Deus in terris. Thou art another God in earth.
                            Many other ſuch Stories there are which I paſſe ouer, wiſhing in my heart, that men would obſerue and ſée what is ſo manifeſt before their eyes: that although the Pope by their diſtinction be not an abſolute

God, or an abſolute Chriſt, yet certainly hee is a very abſolute Antichriſt. I end then this Note with that expoſition of Alexander of Hales, our wittie Country-man: Scriptura non dicitde Moſe, constituite Deum, ſed Deum Pharaonis; hoc est, potentem ſuper Pharaonem diuinitus. The Scripture ſaith not of Moſes, I haue made thee God, but I haue made thee Pharaohs God; that is, of power and ſtrength aboue Pharaoh, through the hand of God, which is with thee.
                            Nothing therefore, I ſay, do Moſes words helpe the Pope, to iuſtifie his blaſphemous pride and inſolencie.
                        2. And Aaron thy brother ſhal be thy Prophet. That is, as he ſaid in ye 4. Chapter, thy mouth, thy Interpreter, thy Speaker, to vtter that eloquently, or in good words, which thou ſhalt appoint him. Thy Prophet, ſaith Theodoret, as if God ſhould haue ſaid, looke how I ſpeake to ye Prophets, &amp; the Prophets to the people; ſo ſhalt thou ſpeake to Aaron, as to thy Prophet, &amp; he vnto the people. Where we ſée ye incōprehenſible Counſell, &amp; wiſedom of God, who, though he could haue giuen to Moſes, as well a rowling tongue, as a wiſe hart: yet he would not, but to ye one brother giueth one gift, to the other another, that either might haue néede &amp; vſe of another, &amp; neither of them be exalted in contempt of the other. This is that which ye Apoſtle ſpeaketh, when he ſaith; Now there are diuerſities of gifts, but the ſame Spirit. For 
                           1. Cor. 12. 4. 8. 
                           to one is giuen by the Spirit the word of wiſedome, and to another the word of knowledge, by the ſame Spirit: And to

                           worketh one and the ſelfe ſame Spirit, diſtributing to euery man ſeuerally as he will. The holy vſe whereof wee ſhall take, if reuerently we eſtéeme one anothers gifts, enuying none, deſpiſing none, carping, cutting, nipping no man, but with an humble heart glorifying God our ſelues, and beſéeching him, that in all our brethren alſo, together with

their ſeuerall charges, he would glorifie his great Name. A Grace ſo much the more precious, by how much it is rare, &amp; too rare, in theſe laſt daies, wherein the Spirit hath foretold vs, Men ſhall be louers of themſelues, couetous,

Thus proteſteth the Apoſtle very carefully, we ſée, when he tooke his leaue of the Elders of Epheſus, ſaying; I haue kept back nothing that was profitable: but haue ſhewed you all the Counſell of

to giue his grace to any man, but it is his mercie, it is his loue, and moſt frée he is to doo with his owne what he will. Rom. 9. 16. 17. 18. The conſideration whereof, ſhould euer worke in vs care and zeale, to craue at Gods hands fleſhie hearts, which may tremble at his Judgements, and taſte his mercy, ſaying with Samuel, Speake on, Lord, thy Seruant heareth; and with Dauid, O my God, I am content to doo it, yea thy lawe is within my heart. Marke alſo héere how God fore-tolde them againe, that Pharaoh would not heare them. 
                           ver. 4. A thing ſo bitter to the faithfull Miniſter of God, as many fore-warnings are néedefull vnto him, to giue him ſtrength againſt this temptation. O therefore, that wee may euer haue patience, who labour in the word and doctrine! God will doo his will, God ought to doo his will, our dutie is knowne, wee may not preſcribe to him: if wee performe what is our part, ſweete is our ſauour (ſaith the bleſſed Apoſtle) as well in them that periſh, as in thoſe that are ſaued: and it is enough. O Lord, let it be enough to euery groaning heart of thy true Miniſters, wiſhing and ſéeking to haue them ſaued, whō thou haſt created, and bought with ſuch a price. Thou canſt make it enough, if it pleaſe thée to bleſſe with thy holy Spirit ye remembrance of it to them that are ſliding to impatiencie.
                        5. Thus warned, and thus armed, theſe two brethren Moſes and Aaron went vnto Pharaoh, and did euen as the 
                           ver. 10. 
                           Lord had commaunded: and Aaron caſteth forth his rod before Pharaoh, and it was turned into a Serpent. The vſe of which myracle hath béene tolde before, euen to ſtrike a feare into Pharaohs heart, that hee might the better attend to what was ſpoken, &amp; to giue him aſſurance, that, though with his eyes he ſawe but the perſons of two men, neither glorious, nor terrible in themſelues; yet, with them was the power and ſtrength of the Almightie God, whoſe hand could ſhiuer him in pieces, if hee rebelled. So ſtandeth it ſtill with Gods Miniſters that faithfully doo their dutie to the flockes committed vnto them; and it would be thought

of, though the perſons of ſuch Meſſengers may be thought contemptible, yet he that ſent them will beare no contempt in the end.
                        6. But Pharaoh by this myracle was made nothing better. Therefore euidently it appeareth that albeit ſignes and myracles be required of ſome men, to ſatiſfie an itching humour to ſée newes, and vnder a pretenſe, that if they ſawe ſuch thinges, they would beléeue: yet indéede theſe meanes will not reforme them, but euen more and more they become rebellious againſt the truth, as héere was Pharaoh. Wherefore the Lord doth not yéeld to the fooliſh fancies of men in this behalfe, but anſwereth in the Goſpel to ſuch humours; This adulterous and crooked generation ſeeketh a ſigne, but none ſhall be giuen them more, than the ſigne of Ionas the Prophet. The conſideration whereof ſhould make vs wiſe, and to ceaſe from vaine ſpéeches, as, what ſigne ſhewe they? what myracles worke they? with ſuch like; And to kéepe in the knowne way, To the Law, and to the Teſtimonie, that is, to the written Eſay. 8. 20. word of God, extant among vs, confeſſed and acknowledged by both ſides; and if our doctrine and perſwaſions be according to that, then are they aſſuredly right, then is there light in our doings, and the Sunne of true vnderſtanding ſhineth vpon vs. For the Word is truth, the Word is olde and oldeſt, a lanthorne, a rule, a guide, a teacher not to be excepted againſt euer. This way doth God chooſe, and trie myracles by it, if you remember, in the 13. of Deut. not admitting of all the wonders in the world, if Deut. 13. 1. they leade contrarie to this; neither reiecting this, though there be no daily wonders added to it, ſince (the doctrine being the ſame) the ſignes and wonders alreadie done by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, mentioned in the Scriptures, abundantly ſerue. But how doth Pharaoh ſhift of this great Signe, ſéeing he is not diſpoſed to yéeld to it? ſurely, if you marke it, euen in the very ſame ſort that ſome now a-daies doo, who talking of Religion, and ſéeming as if they were

willing to be reſolued, when they heare a reaſon which they cannot anſwere, in ſtéede of yéelding, ſay; were ſuch and ſuch heere they could anſwere you, &amp;c. So playeth Pharaoh, hee thinketh of his wiſe men and learned men, whereof Egypt had ſtore: and though he cannot tell what to ſay himſelfe to ſo manifeſt a Signe, yet hee perſwadeth himſelfe they can: and ſend for them hee will, to ſée what they can ſay, rather than yéeld to the worke of God. They being come, as they were blinde themſelues, mingling with good learning vaine errors of Magicke, incantation, and inuocation of Spirits; ſo, in the iuſt Judgement of God, they became inſtruments of blindnes vnto Pharaoh, to holde him ſtill in diſobedience and hardnes of heart againſt the Lord and his true Meſſengers. A thing worthie marking, and due remembrance whileſt wee liue, to the end we may learne to affect truth better, and to giue place to reaſon in our hearts and ſoules, when it is laide before vs, without pinning our ſelues to other mens ſléeues: who erring themſelues in that which is ſought, though otherwiſe happily learned, and to be liked, can neuer doo any better Office to vs than theſe Enchaunters did to Pharaoh; namely ſtill and ſtill with their iuglings make vs ſtiffe and ſtubborne againſt our God, and againſt our good, till we periſh in Hell, as Pharaoh did in the Red-ſea. S. Paule therefore rightly (naming two of theſe Enchaunters) compareth all falſe whiſperers vnto them, ſaying: And as Iannes and Iambres withſtoode Moſes, ſo doo theſe alſo 
                           2. Tim. 3. 8. 
                           reſiſt the truth, men of corrupt mindes, reprobate, concerning the faith. But they ſhall preuaile no longer. &amp;c. 
                           verſe. 9.
                        
                        7. But how did theſe Enchaunters kéepe Pharaoh in his blindnes? The Text ſaith, They did the like: and ſo abated 22 the credite of Aarons myracle. Whereupon queſtion is made, whether in déede and truth they did the like, or onely in ſhewe by deceauing the ſight? And anſwere is giuen by ſome, that, if we affirme God, in anger &amp; Judgement towards Pharaoh, to haue changed the rods alſo of

the Enchaunters into true Serpents, there is no abſurditie: but other (much better) like to ſay, there was a deceauing of ſight, and whatſoeuer ſhew they made, it was but falſe, and phantaſticall: Non fuiſſe veros dracones, ſed ſic apparuiſſe

                            This then eſpeciallie is to be noted, that falſe ſignes and wonders can be done by Sathan, and his members, God ſo permitting: and therefore, that wee ſtand faſt in the truth, which wee haue learned out of Gods Booke; and trie myracles by truth, not truth by myracles, according to the Rule of Deut. 13. 1. God, taught vs in his Word. For, were it neuer ſo ſtrange and admirable a thing, if the drift of it be to leade vs from truth to error, the worke is naught; the worker is a deceauer. Antichriſt (ſaith the Apoſtle) ſhall be powerfull in lying ſignes, and wonders. In regard of which Admonition, S. Auguſtine ſaid, Contra mirabiliarios cautum me fecit Deus meus, &amp;c. Againſt wonder-workers and myraclemongers my God hath made me warie:
                            fore-telling mee, That in the latter dayes there ſhould be ſuch, which (if it were poſſible) ſhould deceiue the very Elect. The Schoolemen ſay héere, Moſes &amp; Aaron fecerunt miraculum; Magi autem mirum, non miraculum. Moſes and Aaron did a myracle, but the Enchaunters did a meruaile, no myracle:
                            meaning, becauſe what they did was counterfeit. But I ſtand not vpon it. It is further moſt worthie marking héere, that Aaron his Rod deuoured their rods: for thereby verſe. 12. wee are notably taught the end of falſhoode and error; at the laſt Truth ſhall deuoure it in Gods good time: for, Magna est veritas, &amp; praeualet. Great is truth, and preuaileth. If you continue in my word,
                            ſaith our bleſſed Sauiour, Iohn. 8. 31. 32. 
                           you ſhall knowe the truth; and the truth ſhall make you free. Yet Pharaoh could not ſée, but his heart was ſtill hardened: euen as in our times wee knowe the fearefull ver. 13. blindnes of ſome, in the greateſt light that may be giuen

them. A wiſe heart will note this earneſtly: and neither be moued to ſuch obſtinacie, nor ceaſe to feare the like iudgement, if vnthankfully Gods fauour vouchſafed, be paſſed ouer. Much doth God for either man, or place, when hee graciouſlie giueth good Teachers; and where ſuch Enchaunters as theſe, are receaued and hearkened vnto, what can follow, but Pharaohs hard hart to eternall woe? Beware, beware, whileſt God giueth you time. To day if you will heare his voice, harden not your heart. How knowe you what iudgement and wrath to morrowe day may bring vpon you? Truth may be oppreſſed for a time, God ſo pleaſing, either to puniſh, or trie his people; but finally ſuppreſſed it ſhall not be; God being ſtronger than all his enemies, and able to diſperſe all duſkie cloudes, bringing his glorious truth out, to beare ſway againe, at his good pleaſure.

Concerning ſome profitable vſe of all which to our ſelues, thus may we meditate and thinke of them.
                        
                           
1. God telleth Moſes, that Pharaoh in the morning 
                           15. 
                           will come to the water, to wit, vnto the riuer Nilus, and there he ſhould meete him. Whereby wee ſée the truth of the Pſalmiſt his ſpéech, O Lord, thou haſt ſearched mee out, and knowne me, thou knoweſt my downe ſitting, and mine vpriſing; yea, thou vnderſtandeſt my thoughts, and that long before, thou art about my bed, and about my pathes, &amp; ſpieſt out all my wayes. What care then ſhould wee haue of our actions, when euery ſtep of ours is thus knowne to God? Hee knoweth, you ſée, which way wee will walke in the morning, before euer wee goe out of our houſes; and he knoweth all, to goe no further in this matter.
                        2. Wee ſée againe, how the Lord ſmiteth the waters héere, that the Egyptians might knowe, as alſo all the 17. world beſides, how the Lord our God hath power ouer all his creatures, to giue the vſe of them to vs, and to take the vſe of them from vs, at his pleaſure.

Now therefore he will touch them a little néerer, he will ſtrike the water, which neither man nor beaſt may want, and ſo ſée if their hearts will yéeld obedience to his will. Thus aſſuredly dealeth he with men and women at this day, but (peraduenture) it is not marked. He encreaſeth his croſſes, from goods to bodie, from body to minde, from ourſelues to our children, and ſtill maketh vs abound with more want and woe, in greater and ſharper meaſure, that we may repent and turne, if wee will be perſwaded: if not, in the end he can make an end, and finally deſtroy vs with miſerie that ſhall neuer end. O that wee may haue then wiſe hearts, to obſerue the ſteps and degrées of Gods dealing with vs, profiting by the leſſer, and ſo preuenting the greater, to his good contentment, and our euerlaſting comfort, and ſafety. Nilus was a riuer wherein they much gloried, receauing by it great riches, and great defence: wherefore, to ſée this riuer turned into blood ſo fearefullie, might well haue ſmitten their hearts, and made them humble themſelues to God; but nothing will humble ſome men: neither entred all this into Pharaohs heart; which hardnes is euer a fearefull ſigne, and to be prayed againſt. Marke it alſo, how, if we ſtoope not to God, but continue obſtinate, by degrées hee will come to our néereſt and déereſt

comforts. Thus, I hope, if you reade this Chapter ouer againe in your Bible, you ſ

                        In this Chapter are ſet downe three fearefull plagues more.

                              The plague of Frogges.
                              The plague of Lice.

                        1. WHereof to make vſe to our inſtruction and reformation, let vs conſider this gracious Admonition in the firſt verſe, vouchſafed to Pharaoh againe. Let my people goe that they may

                           ſerue mee. Can there any thing be ſwéeter to the Childe of God, than to marke, how ſlowe the Lord is to puniſh, and how deſirous of amendment without puniſhment? O howe may my Soule aſſure it ſelfe of mercie, if penitentially I ſéke it, where ſuch a Nature is? Cannot hee endure to puniſh Pharaoh, a proude and haughtie rebell againſt his

Diuine will? and will he willingly ſmite my poore ſoule, your poore ſoule, or any poore ſoule bruſed and broken with the ſenſe of ſinne, and groaning, and ſighing for one drop of mercie at his hand? No, no, there is mercy with the Lord, and therefore ſhall he euer be feared; Hee is ſlowe

                           to anger, and of great kindnes. Hee will not alwaies chide, neither keepe his anger for euer. He hath not dealt with vs after our ſinnes, nor rewarded vs according to our iniquities. For as high as the Heauen is aboue the Earth, 
                           11. 
                           ſo great is his mercie toward them that feare him. As farre 
                           12. 
                           as the Eaſt, is from the Weſt, ſo farre hath hee remooued our ſinnes from vs. As a Father hath compaſſion on his 
                           13 
                           Children, ſo hath the Lord compaſſion on them that feare him. For he knoweth whereof we be made: hee remembreth 
                           14. 
                           that we are but duſt. Therefore he admoniſheth, as wee ſée in this place, againe and againe, before hee will let his rod fall vpon very Pharaoh. Who will not hearken then vnto his ſwéete Uoice, and bee admoniſhed by ſo louing a Father, ſo mercifull a God, and ſo powerfull a Creator? Surely if wee ſmart, wee muſt néedes approoue his Juſtice, for his Mercie is manifeſt, wee cannot denie it. Yet, yet, ſaith this gracious God, goe to Pharaoh, and warne him againe, that hee may be wiſe, and let my people goe.

For till now, we haue heard but of the Iſraelites afflictions, how ſtill they ſuffered, and were ill entreated, hauing ſore burthens laid vpon them, and moſt bitter griefes daily heaped vnto their hearts. But now we ſée a change, they are ſpared, they are comforted, and they are defended, when theſe dreadfull plagues light vpon their enemies, one after another. So, ſo ſhall the ſorrowes of the godly be euer turned into ioy, when the Lord ſéeth his time, and the fading comforts of the wicked turned into wéeping, and wofull lamentation. Your ſorrowe, ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt, ſhall

Be of good comfort then in your ſelfe, when you reade this, and profit your heart with this Note or Meditation. The changes of this world are many, but with Gods faithfull people it ſhall euer be well in the end.
                        4. It is further to bee obſerued in this your Chapter, how the Lord with varietie and vehemencie of words doth amplifie this plague, not onely ſaying, He will ſend Frogs (which yet had béene fearefull,) but that the riuers ſhould 2. 3. ſcrawle full of Frogs, that they ſhould goe vp, and come into the Kings houſe and into his bed-chamber where hee ſlept, and vpon his bed, and into the houſe of his ſeruants,

and vpon his people, and into his ouens, and into his kneading troughes, yea ſaith he, the frogges ſhall climbe vp vpon thee, and on thy people, and vpon all thy ſeruants.

The like vehemencie doth he vſe in that notable chapter, the 28. of Deut. amplifying both ſides with many words, and great variety of phraſe, full of force and edge, all aſſuredly to mooue, and pierce, but it would not be. Thus dealeth hée at this day with his people, he giueth vnto them ſometimes Paſtors and Teachers, who rightly may bée called Sonnes of thunder, in regard of their

The old world would not beléeue the threatned Floud, neither the ſtobborne Jewes, that the Chaldean King ſhould come vppon them. But when they cryed to their ſoules, pax, pax, peace, peace,
                            (for all this earneſtneſſe of Ier. 2. the Preacher) then came ſodaine and fearefull deſtruction vpon them, as they deſerued. So euer, ſo euer let vs be ſure, firſt, or laſt. And therefore make vſe of vehemency, when God directeth his Preacher to it.
                        5. But what an armie is this againſt ſuch a Prince? Had God neither men, nor Angels to commaund? Yes, yes, it néedeth no proofe: wée know both men, and Angels commaunded by him at his pleaſure. But here he would vſe neither, déeming it fit to confound the pride of ſuch a conceited king by an hoſt of frogges, rather than by either of the other. So ſhall the Lord, by contemptible and baſe things, caſt down our high lookes, if we ſwel againſt him. Hée would alſo haue Pharaoh hereby ſée how eaſily hée

could deſtroy him, if he l

And the ſame he would haue all high mindes at this daie ſée, making vſe thereof vnto humility, before they finde it is too late. For as eaſily can the Lord now raiſe vp ſtrange plagues, as then. Varro writeth that a citie in Fraunce was driuen away with this very plague of frogges. A town in Theſſaly rooted vp and ouerthrown with moules. A whole land forced to remoue with mice, and many ſuch things haue Stories left to our remembrance. There was a time, when the French diſeaſe was not ſo common, nor our Engliſh ſweat knowne. That plague of the Philiſtines 1. Sam. 5. 6. with the Emerods in their hinder parts is in Gods Cronicle. That conſumption of Herod with lice, and Act. 12. 23. 2. Macab. 9. 9. that fearefull example of Antiochus, they ought both to be marked; but nothing ſhall profit, except Grace be giuen from aboue. And therefore a féeling heart of fleſh, the Lord, for his mercy ſake, euer graunt vnto vs.

Why doth he not make his Wiſemen take them away, his Inchaunters and Sorcerers, that could ſet a ſhew of making the like? Could they cauſe frogges to come, and not goe? Or, why doth he not call to his gods and Idols to helpe him to take them away? Can none helpe him but Moſes and Aaron, by praying for him? See then how the Lord (when he pleaſeth) is able to force the wicked to the acknowledgment of him, and his true Miniſters; and let it comfort vs in the middeſt of all contempts, either of our God, of our faith, and religion, or of our perſons.

when we ſée ſuch things. Not long ſince this proud Pharaoh ſaid, WHO IS THE LORD? But now he ſéeth, and Cap. 5. 2. muſt confeſſe, that there is no helpe, but in this Lord. His Gods are weake, and the frogs crawled in deſpight of them. Moſes therefore muſt pray to his God to helpe, and take them away. And who now, but Moſes &amp; Aaron, with Pharaoh? Ah wée deſpiſed Miniſters by the proude worldlings! let vs marke it, and beare their cōtempts. In their extremities they ſhall acknowledge our callings, iuſtifie our loue, and wiſhe our prayers: They ſhall ſtoupe, they ſhall ſtoupe, when our God pleaſeth, and it is inough. Remember that great Nabuchadnezar, how the Lord Dan. 4 22. ſtouped him, till hée ſhould know, that the Lord ruleth. Pray, pray for vs (O Samuel) ſaid the ſtobborne Iſraelites (when God would,) and ſo they came to him, whom they erſt neglected. Men and brethren what ſhall we doe? ſaid they, béeing touched, that before thought much to be aduiſed by ſuch men. Ieroboam ſendeth to the Prophet, whoſe doctrine he would not follow, and no worſe a meſſenger, than his owne wife, and in his heart he acknowledgeth, that truth is with him. The great Turke in theſe daies will ſéeke the prayers of Chriſtian-men, when yet he fighteth againſt the truth that they embrace. And many (which at other times regard them not) either going to ſea, or to battaile, or béeing ſicke, and vexed at home, will ſend, and ſéeke for the prayers, and comfort of Gods Miniſters. And what is this, but a ſigne of Gods Omnipotent hand ouer all Pharaohs whatſoeuer, and that he can reuenge our contempts, and giue our truth, and carefull walking in our places, a due regarde and reuerence, when he will, with them, and in them? Let the ſwéeteneſſe of it ioy vs, and make vs poſſeſſe our ſoules in patience. Diues, that rich glutton, ſhal ſée Lazarus right, &amp; himſelfe wrong, one day.
                        8 But why dooth Pharaoh now call, rather than in the former plague, for Moſes and Aaron to pray? Surely becauſe

this plague more nipped him than the former. For when the riuers were blood, he might haue wine to drinke, and by that meanes not finde the ſmart ſo much. See wee then, howbeit other mens harmes ſhould affect vs; yet, vnleſſe the Lord touch our ſelues, we are dull, and dead, without ſenſe. Which certainly maketh God reach vs a blowe many times, when otherwiſe he would ſpare vs, did we make good vſe of our Brethrens harmes. Applie therefore euer to your ſelfe Gods doings, ſaying in your heart; and why, Lord, am I not ſo alſo? Doo not I alſo offend thée? Father of Heauen, and God of all mercie, make me wiſe by other mens harmes, and thankfull vnto thée, that I am ſo ſchooled, rather than with mine owne woe.
                        9. Sée how readie Moſes is to pray for Pharaoh, when ver. 9. he biddeth him to appoint the time himſelfe of his prayer: and let it make vs thinke with our ſelues, whether wee be thus harted, to pray readily, and willingly for Prince, for Country, for friends, and familie; yea, let it open vnto vs, what I feare is too true, that in our liues, ſcarce once, we haue béene vpon our knées for any of theſe, but euen goe on in a common courſe, haling and pulling with the world all the wéeke long, and on the Holiday goe to the Church, rather for faſhion, than deuotion, praying with lips, not with heart, a fewe words, and then ſpending all the reſt of the time, either in ſléeping, or gazing, or thinking of matters little belonging to God. O that wee may profit by this readines in Moſes, to pray for ſuch a wicked king. Remember the Scriptures, where you ſee, how fathers and mothers haue gone to Chriſt for their children, Maiſters for their ſeruants, and neighbours for their friends. Chriſt is th
                              〈…〉
                           me, and why ſhould not we alſo be the ſame? and Morning and Euening goe vnto God for our ſelues, and ours, as héere did Moſes for Pharaoh?
                        
                        10. It may be moued for a queſtion, why Pharaoh being offered to appoint the time himſelfe, appointed the next day, ſaying, To morrowe, rather than preſently, the

Frogges being ſo vgly, and no place frée from them, no not the Kings Chamber? Who would not haue cryed now now, euen forthwith, pray, that I may be deliuered from this plague, rather than to haue ſtayed till the next day? It is anſwered, firſt, that hee ſtill doubted, whether it was the Finger of God, or an enchauntment: and therefore was content to deferre the time, to trie whether of it ſelfe it would paſſe away, and ſo to diſcredite Moſes and Aaron. Such hollowe holes are in Hypocrites hearts, when they ſéeme religious, and carefull of Prayer, or other good things. Secondly, héerein he ſhewed the nature of the wicked, who not onely deferre their owne duties from day to day, but (as much as they can) put ouer others alſo, that offer good things vnto them: as for example, if a Preacher tender his ſeruice this Sabaoth, he is tolde, the next will be far more fit: and, if he come alſo the next Sabaoth, then is either the Maiſter from home, the Gentlewoman ſicke, the weather too hote, or colde, or ſome ſuch thing; that, be Moſes neuer ſo readie, yet Pharaoh is not readie, but cras, cras, to morrowe, to morrowe,
                            is ſtill the ſong, till the Lord ſtrike, and all Morrowes end, wee paſſing away to woe without end, for our deferring. That Moſes taketh his owne time, and ſaith, Be it as thou haſt ſaid, it is to teach him, that at all times the Lord is the Lord, his myracles no enchauntments, but a powerfull working for his owne glory, &amp; the gracious Deliuerance of his Church.
                        11. Then Moſes and Aaron went out from Pharaoh:
                            
                           Verſe 12. 
                           and Moſes cried vnto the Lord concerning the Frogges, &amp;c. Why went Moſes forth? might not hee haue ſtayed in the Court, and haue prayed there? God forbid, but wee ſhould thinke Courts to be places of prayer, for ſuch as haue a cenſcience, in euery place to lift vp hands, and heart to God: yet, would God alſo, the hinderances and impediments ſo to doo in thoſe places, were fewer! Surelie great Courtiers are found, that a meaner place hath

yéelded their hearts more heate to good things, than thoſe gliſtering places haue, as ſometimes a Country-houſe, and ſometimes a darke hole in a cloſe priſon. Moſes cried vnto the Lord, ſaith the Text, and prayer doth, what neither doores, nor lockes, nor any ſtrength, or wit of man could doo; the weapons of Gods children are ſuch, and ſo mightie. The word of Crying noteth the vehemencie of Moſes prayer, againſt colde formalitie, too common in moſt prayers. It noteth not any loudnes of voice (although that alſo be lawfull at times) ſince the ſame Moſes is ſaid Exod. 14. 15. 
                           to crie in another place, when hee ſpake not a word, but from his inward Spirit. Ezechias thus cried vnto his God, and eſcaped both a mortall diſeaſe, and the huge hoſt of the Aſſyrians. But what prayer can doo, I hope you knowe, and therefore goe no further.
                        12. And the Lord did according to the Saying of Moſes.
                            
                           Verſe 13. Sée the credite that Gods ſeruants haue with their mercifull God: they aſke, and he giueth without any ſtop. Can you thinke, God heareth Moſes alone? no, ſaith the Pſalme, God is neere vnto all that call vpon him; yea to 
                           Pſal. 145. 18. 19. 
                           all, all, and euer remember it. Hee will fulfill the deſire of all them that feare him; he will heare their crie, and will ſaue them. The Lord preſerueth all them that loue him: 
                           20. 21. 
                           but he will deſtroy all the vngodly. Wherefore, my mouth ſhall ſpeake the praiſe of the Lord, and all fleſh ſhall bleſſe his holy Name for euer and euer. Daily experience sheweth the like, and therefore as Moſes héere (euen deſpiſed Moſes) was ſtronger with his God, and by his God, than all Egypt, to remoue a plague; ſo ſhall wee euer be more ſtrong than our enemies, in what God ſhall ſée vs fit to be enabled. Wherefore one Moſes is better for a kingdome, than many others, that are iudged to be of greater vertue, &amp;c.
                        13. So the Frogges dyed in the houſes, in the townes, and in the fields. And they gathered them together on heapes, and the Land ſtanke of them, ſaith the Text. Had Verſe 13. 14.
                           
it not béene as eaſie for the Lord to haue taken them quite away? aſſuredly to the Lord all was one: but this was done, to ſhewe the truth of the myracle, that they were Frogges indéede, &amp; no enchauntments; thereby to méete with the vnbeléefe of the King, and all his Courtiers, who either openly in words, or ſecretly in heart thought otherwiſe. And by one meanes, or other, the Lord ſhall euer, in his good time, deliuer his truth from falſe ſurmiſes, his faithfull Miniſters from falſe imputations, and write the wickedneſſe of Atheiſts, and carnall men, vppon their faces to their confuſion. Onely be wee patient, to tarie his will, to like of his way, and be we aſſured, we ſhall both ſée his glory, and receaue comfort.
                        14. But when Pharaoh ſawe that he had reſt giuen him, he hardned his heart, and hearkened not vnto them, as the 
                           Verſe 15. 
                           Lord had ſaid. Sée the corruption of our nature, if God worke not. No ſooner is the rod off, but as the Dogge to his vomite, and the Sowe to her myre, ſo wretched man returneth to his olde bias, and falleth to his former ſinne againe. When wee are ſicke, or diſtreſſed any way, wee pretend repentance, wee pray, wee crie, wee vowe, and what not (in ſhewe?) But foraſmuch as all riſeth from feare, and not from loue, it vaniſheth againe, as ſoone as the feare is paſt; and the Deuill returneth with ſeauen worſe than himſelfe, making our end more odious, than euer our beginning was. This hath béene touched before, but yet euer marke it, and feare it your ſelfe, as you haue a care to pleaſe God. For if you forſake God, you can neuer blame God, if hee forſake you, and if, after God hath giuen you reſt, you become retchleſſe, as Pharaoh was here; then if, as hee in the ſea, ſo you in eternall woe be drowned for euer, you haue your deſert, and GOD is iuſt.
                        15. The Frogge is (as wee all knowe) a foule filthie creature, abiding in foule places, as bogges, and myrie plaſhes all the day long, and at night péeping out with the

head aboue the water, making a hatefull noiſe with many others of his ſort, till the day appeare againe. Wherefore Diuines haue thought, that by theſe foule creatures fitlie might be reſembled ſuch croking Crues, as hiding themſelues all the day in an Ale denne, or ſuch like place of vncleanenes, as ſoone as night commeth, put out their heads, and make a hatefull noiſe againſt Gouernours and Superiours, neighbours, and honeſt perſons, till all that heare them be wearie of them. Which filthie Frogges the Lord aſſuredly will deale with all in his good time, as here he did with theſe Egyptian Frogges: namely, kill them, deſtroy them, and make the ſtinch of them knowne to manie. Till then, let patience and righteous dealing be the armour of the godly, and withall, how many of ſuch vglie creatures this world hath, let it be conſidered: that therevpon may ariſe this fruitfull Meditation, how little cauſe good men and women haue, to be in loue with this world, to build tabernacles in it, and to ſay and thinke it is good being heere; but rather to ſigh, and wiſh to be looſed, and to liue there, where the Elect of God, hauing the Harpes of 
                           Apoc. 15. 2. 3. 
                           God, ſing the ſong of Moſes,
                            where they crie Hallelu-iah,

                           ſaluation, and glory, and honour, and power be to the Lord, &amp;c. O difference of places, if we had eyes, or heads, or hearts! God, God, for his Chriſt ſake, giue vs féeling. Amen.
                        
                     
                     
                        The 3. plague of Lice.
                        THis is the 3. plague, which the Lord by his mightie power brought vpon this hard hearted King, and his ver. 16. 17. people, ſée king thereby their good, but preuailed not. In which alſo (for our inſtruction) wee may obſerue diuers things. As firſt, why the Lord did not bring againe vpon them his former plagues, either of Frogges, or bloodie water, letting them reſt vpon them till they were ſtouped;

but ſtill bringeth new, &amp; others than the former? Wherevnto wee may anſwere, that the Lord did this, to ſhewe, that his power was not tyed to any one thing, but by infinite wayes able to puniſh ſinners, if they will be ſtubborne, more and more, ſo to feare them, and by them, vs, to the worlds end. Which, happie we, if it doo to amendment, that his many, and ſtrange, and dreadfull plagues, may be euer and euer far from vs.
                        2. We may note that as eaſie it had béene for the Lord, to haue turned the duſt into Lyons, and Beares, and Wolues, both of ſtrange greatnes, and cruell fiercenes; but that rather hee choſe to confound pride by weakenes, and a rebelling humour by ſo baſe a creature, as at other times often hee vſed to doo. And more it fretteth a high minde, as you may note in Abimelech, who ſought of his ſeruant to ſlay him, rather than it ſhould be ſaide, that a 
                           Iudg. 9. 54. 
                           woman had ouercome him. In vs let it worke thus much, that if ſuch a vile creature may (by God) be made too ſtrong for a Kingdome, what reſiſtance can I, one man, or one woman make againſt the Lords wrath, if I pull it vpon me by my ſinnes, by my proude, haughtie, and careleſſe heart? His wrath can arme all the creatures in Heauen, &amp; Earth againſt me; and yet the leaſt of them is thus farre aboue my power, as you ſée héere. Wicked are the words of ſome prophane mouthes at times, ſaying, Let vs haue our will now, and wee will ſhift then. O vaine heart, what ſhift can it thinke of againſt ſuch a GOD? Shake and tremble at this dulnes betimes, leſt the plague of it ſhiuer thée in péeces for euermore. The water cruſheth Pharaoh, and all his people in the Kingdome; the Earth now alſo ſendeth vermine vpon him, and hee cannot ſhift againſt ſuch a vile and contemptible creature. Followe this Meditation in your minde, and let it profit you: for, before the face of his wrath, who can ſtand?

                        3. Novve the Enchaunters aſſayed likewiſe vvith theyr Enchauntments to bring foorth Lice, but they

could not. Powerfull then is the Deuill, when God will ſuffer him; but when God will reſtraine him, what can he doo? And this to ye Storie of Iob, to the Storie of ye heard of Swine in the Goſpel, &amp; ſuch other places; &amp; grow we in cō
                           fort againſt this deadly foe of ours. For we ſée his weakneſſe, and the bridling hand of God at all times ouer him, when God pleaſeth. Feare God, and feare not Sathan; but contemne God, and then ſhake to thinke of Sathans fierce rage, when once he hath leaue giuen to torment thee.
                        4. Behold againe a good thing: before, the Inchanters did the like, but here now they cannot for their liues. As then a time there is of triall betwixt contrary opinions, and croſſing miracles, that they which are of God may bee knowne: ſo is there a time, euen a ioyful happy time, when the Lord will cut of that difference and miſmaze, that doubting, that iuggling, and deceiptful working, and giue his truth victorie ouer all Inchanters: Iames and Iambres 
                           2. Tim. 3. 8. 
                           witſtood Moſes, ſaith the Apoſtle, and ſo did ſome then, and yet now with vs, reſiſt the truth, Men of corrupt mindes, and reprobat, concerning the faith. But Moſes had victory ouer thoſe of his time, &amp; the Apoſtle ſaith, the other of his time ſhal no longer preuaile, their madnes being manifeſt to all men. Therefore, for them of our time, we may not doubt of like ſucceſſe againſt them: onely let vs haue patience (as I often ſay) till the time come. Waies can he nener want to ouerthrow them, when in ſuch weake creatures, as theſe were, he is ſo ſtrong. A ſéely ſimple man in the famous Counſel of Nice without Logicke, or Rhetoricke, or any helpe of the Arts, gaue that vaunting Philoſopher an ouerthrowe; and gained him from his vanity vnto God; the Storie is knowne, and I paſſe it ouer. In our times women and children haue foiled Doctors, yt 
                           euen out of babes &amp; ſucklings mouthes, the praiſe of God might be ordained. In ſome thing or other ſhall falſhood ſtil faile, that ſuch as haue eies may ſée

the truth. Amplify it further as you pleaſe, for (God be thanked) there be manie proofes.
                        5. Then ſaid the Inchanters to Pharaoh, This is the 
                           ver. 19. 
                           finger of God. Wherein obſerue, how the wicked, who, for a time, make ſhew, as though God were on their ſide, in Gods good time ſhall be forced to acknowledge the contrarie, to his glorie, and the great comfort of his Church, and children. For, what are theſe wordes other in ſence, than (as if they ſhould haue ſaide) we haue hitherto deluded the eies and ſenſes of the beholders by our inchantments; but now we are no more able to doo ſo? This which is now done paſſeth our ſkill, and albeit the creature be vile and baſe, yet is the power of God ſuch ouer vs, and our Art, that wee cannot doo the like, but giue him the victorie, and acknowledge our ſelues ſinfull, weake, and wicked men? Thus were Nabuchadnezzar in Daniel, and Antiochus in Dan. 2. 3. 2. Maccab. 9. the Maccabies, drawn to confeſſe Gods power ouer them, and all their greatneſſe. Which certainly is an vnſpeakeable comfort to all that depend vppon him in their troubles. For what can any man doo againſt you, againſt me, or any other, more than this God, (ſo potent, and puiſant) will giue him leaue to doo? and what leaue will he giue him more, than in the end ſhall turne to our good, for whom he hath not ſpared, to giue his deareſt ſon to death, that euer we might be aſſured of him?
                        6. Yet Pharaohs heart, ſaith the Text, remained ſtill obſtinate, and he hearkened not vnto them, &amp;c. So laying before vs a notable example of the rooted wickedneſſe in mans heart, béeing left of God vnto itſelfe. For, as now you ſée, not his own inchanters mooue him any thing at all, though they acknowledge before him the power of God. It maketh mee thinke of ſome men in our daies, who by no meanes can be wonne to the truth, no not by their owne men, (who ſometimes haue erred, as now they do, but in the mercy of God haue receiued light) both ſpeaking, and writing what ſhould profit others.

This is a fearefull hardneſſe to be prayed againſt by all that haue a care of their owne ſaluation.
                     
                     
                        The fourth plague of Flies.
                        1. THeſe things thus paſſed ouer, the Lord haſteth ver. 24. to an other plague, ſéeing the former could not moue: and as Pharaohs malice increaſed, ſo ſharper and ſharper is the Lords hand. For now commeth a plague moſt bitter to him, and all his: euen ſwarmes of very noiſom creatures, Flies, Waſpes, Hornets Canker-wormes, Locuſts, Scorpious, and ſuch like; ſo that now moſt fearefully they were vexed in euery place. Diuines meditating vpon this plague, haue reſembled vnto it thoſe cares and thoughts, wherewith worldlie men are vſuallie vexed: for, as the Flies did neuer ſuffer the Egyptians to ſléepe or take any reſt; ſo doo thoſe cares torment all day and night. Others haue reſembled thoſe bitings and touchings of conſcience, which men ſo grieuouſlie often féele, to theſe Flies; becauſe, as in the one, ſo in the other, the griefe is greater than can bée expreſſed. Againe becauſe, as theſe Flies were a puniſhment, forerunning the deliuerance of Gods people; ſo theſe agonies of minde going before, great and Heauenly comfort doth vſually follow. A thing worthy of remembrance to troubled mindes and full of contentment, if they will holde faſt by him, that is alwaies mercifull, and calleth vnto him all that trauell, and are heauy laden. Others conſidering the nature of theſe Flies haue compared Tyrants and oppreſſors of their weaker brethren vnto them. For, as theſe Flies ſucked-out the Egyptians blood with biting, and ſtinging and cauſing, of ſmart; ſo doo ſuch cruell men, till they haue gorged themſelues with ſinlful ſpoiles of their Chriſtian brethren. There be great Flies, &amp; thoſe be Great men, that tyrannouſly rule, not ſhearing, but ſhauing to the very ſkinne, if they take

not ſkinne and all. There be leſſer Flies, and thoſe be vſurers, and other biting binders, who with their Nouerint Vniuerſi, make an vniuerſall ruine of many a mans eſtate, &amp; ſo fetch him in ſtill with the Condition of the Obligation, that in the end his Condition is wofull, and his heart breaketh with the bitter griefe of Be it knowne vnto all men. Surelie theſe are curſed Flies indéede, the ſuckers of our ſap, the bibbers of our blood, the pinchers of our harts, and the ſtingers, and wringers of our very ſoules. The Egyptian Flie was nothing like vnto them, but yet, you ſée, was a great plague of God ſent to puniſh the ſinne of men. But let them remember that theſe Flyes of Egypt had but a time; God ſent them in wrath, and tooke them away in mercie, vppon intreatie. Some Moſes, or other ſhall ſtande vp; and the Lorde ſhall ſende a ſtrong weſt-winde, to take theſe Canker-wormes away, and caſt them into the Red-ſea, that in our roaſt they may torment no longer. Philo, the Jewe, in the life of Moſes, ſaith, that becauſe the Egyptians did (as it were) ſting the Iſraelites with many biting and bitter wordes, ſcoffes and ſcornes, taunts and ieſtes; therefore the Lod ſent theſe Flies &amp; Hornets among them, that one thing might be puniſhed with an other. And moſt certaine it is, that ſuch Stingers ſhall bee puniſhed, as God ſhal thinke good in his due time.
                        2. Theſe Flyes were not in the land of Goſhen, and that (ſaith the Text) becauſe God made a ſeperation.

                            others, it is not by our owne vertue or policie, but by that gratious ſeperation, which the Lord maketh: whoſe mercy and loue that we might more fully ſée, he ſaueth vs from that euill. Wherein how may we runne into perti

we ſufficient; others in continuall paine and labour, we in reſt, and eaſe, and comfort; others in priſon, we at liberty; others in blindneſſe, wee in light; others ſclaundered, wee not touched; others croſſed in their children, and friends, wee comforted; others wake, we ſléepe; others wéepe, wée ſing; and, which is the top and height of all miſerie, others are ſo tempted, that they violently caſt themſelues away, when we in the meane time féele no temptation. O bleſſed God, what a ſeperation is this. Let vs euer thinke of it, and be thankeful for it.
                        3 When Pharaoh and his people were vexed with this Plague, Moſes and Aaron, according to his former manner were called for, and licence giuen them to goe, and doo ſacrifice, but with limitation (in this Land) and when that Ver. 25. would not ſatiſfie Moſes (for the reaſons mentioned in the twenty ſixe verſe,) then it is inlarged to the wilderneſſe 
                           Ver. 28. alſo, but yet againe limitted, (Goe not farre away.) Where we are to mark the faſhion, not onelie of worldly Princes, but of all wordlie and earthlie minded men, how they can, vpon vrgent neceſſitie, be content to tollerate Religion, ſo it might ſtil be ioyned with their profit: but if it be once contrary to that, O how bitter then▪ how hard then to endure it, and giue it frée, and louing paſſage! For theſe Jewes wholly to depart from Egypt, was not for Pharaohs profit (for from their labours he had great gaine) and therefore by no meanes may they go out of his land, to ſacrifice to their God, but in the land he is content to endure them, ſo he may be fréede from theſe plagues, that ſo fearefully God ſent vpon his people. Or, if it néedes muſt be, that they muſt goe forth of the Land, yet not farre away in any caſe. Thus was hee, thus are many at this day, and to the worlds end theſe wretches will not want, who haue their gaine for their God, and no other Religion will euer like, than what may ſtand with the ſame, as much as poſſibly they can procure. Let vs ſée it, &amp; marke it, and hate it; for it is not that which can pleaſe God.

                           If we be riſen with Chriſt, we muſt ſeek the things that 
                           Coloſ. 3. 1. 
                           are aboue: and, if we loue any thing more than him, we neuer can enioy him. His kingdome is not of this world; and if our ioy and glorie be in it, we are not his followers. Loue not this world, ſaith Saint Iohn, neither any thing in

For, if the loue of the world be in vs, the loue of God is not in vs. That builder of greater barnes for his large commings in, was but a foole, in his eies, who only is wiſe: and when his ſoule was taken away, whoſe were all his toyles and trauels? That purple pampered Glutton went to the Deuill, and with all his worldlie wealth could not procure one drop of water, to coole his ſcalded tongue. The gaine of Gold makes many looſe their ſoules. The gréedy wretch that for himſelfe ſtill ſpares, doth hoord-up nothing but continuall cares. Hermocrates, lying at the point of death, bequeathed his goods to none, but himſelfe. The fire burneth

WHereof that we may make like vſe, as before, let vs firſt note, frō whence any murren of cattell doth come, when wee are that way puniſhed in a countrie; ſurely, euen from the Lord, as we ſée héere. Not ſimply frō Witches, and Sorcerers, ſet on by malicious neighbours, as we vſually thinke: for what can a whole Legion of Deuils doe to one ſwine, without leaue graunted from the Lord? you know the place, and it ought to be thought vpon.

                     2 But ſtill the Lord ſpareth the Iſraelites. True, and ſée the vſe of it. Firſt, God in his Juſtice this way more tormenteth verſe. 4. the mindes of the wicked, who (for their rebellion againſt him) deſerue all puniſhment: ſo ſaith the Pſalme, The wicked ſhall ſee this, and conſume away. 
                        Pſal. 112. 10. Secondly, the Lord aſſureth his Choſen in all the world, that albeit in leſſer matters he trieth them, or chaſticeth them, as hee dooth others; yet, when his great

plagues come of Judgement vnto death, and deſtruction eternall, he will ſurely make a ſeparation, to the vnſpeakeable Comfort of his owne, and to the eternall praiſe of his mercie. The wordes of the Prophet are plaine. For a little

Good therefore is that prayer of Dauid, euer to be in our minde, whereſoeuer we are. O knit my heart vnto thee, Lord, that I may feare thy name, that I may euer cleaue vnto thee, euer be thine, and neuer be drawne away from thee by any temptation whatſoeuer.

                        the Lord ſhall finiſh this thing in this Land. So that, not onely the Judgement, and affliction which happeneth, is of the Lord; but the very time alſo, when it ſhall begin, and when it ſhall end: before which time, no malice of man, or Deuill, can bring it, no power of any creature can take it away.

and hee did not let the people goe. Marke it well, and thinke with your ſelfe, whether any Preacher, or Teacher can be plainer in words, than GOD was héere, by works: or whether any man can euer bee made to ſée a truth by teaching, more euidently and manifeſtly, than Pharaoh héere ſawe this hand of God ſmiting Egypt, and ſparing Iſrael? yet, though GOD be the Teacher himſelfe, and the matter ſubiect to his eyes without deniall, Pharaoh ſtill is obſtinate, ſtill the ſame, ſtill a ſtriuer againſt God, and his grace. How then doo wee wonder, that where the Word is preached, truth ſoundly and plainly taught, yet all be not reformed, and reclaimed frō their errors? Is there any fault in the Word, or Teacher? are not things plaine? how then commeth this to paſſe? but euen, as héere it did, from the fearefull wrath of GOD, hardning ſuch hearts, and cloſing ſuch eyes, that they can neither ſée, féele, or vnderſtand to ſaluation? All becauſe they haue not a loue to the truth, but are hypocrites, ſcorners, deriders, and ſuch as heare onely for faſhion, thinking themſelues abundantly ſkilfull, when indéede they are moſt ignorant, and when as they may ſée the Lord (by his Prophet) affirming, that he will looke vnto none, but ſuch

That is, humble in their owne eyes, receauing the Word with reuerence, hungring and thirſting after the ſame, as the Spirituall foode of their ſoules, &amp; ſaying in their hearts, as Samuel did, Speake on, Lord, thy ſeruant heareth. Surelie, neither true matter, nor plaine manner will ſerue, vnleſſe God ſtrike a holy ſtroke within vs, by his powerfull Spirit, that wee may be moued. Therefore, as it is a bleſſing to haue truth tolde vs; ſo is it a double bleſſing, to haue a ſoft heart giuen vs, moued, &amp; yéelding to the truth. Otherwiſe, as you ſée in the Smiths ſhop, as many hard blowes laide vpon his Anuile, as vpon the Iron hee worketh, and yet the Anuile remaineth all one, and the Iron turneth to the Smithes deſire, becauſe in the one there is

heate, &amp; in the other none: So in the ſame Auditorie, as manie proofes, and reaſons are laid open to one, as to another, and yet one moued, and not another. S. Auguſtine ſaith, Non verbis hominis fit, vt intelligatur verbum Dei, facit Deus vt intelligatis. The words of man cannot make man vnderſtand God his word, but it is God that maketh them to vnderſtand.
                         Joy therefore in the Lord his mercie towards you, when you haue féeling; knowe that it is a grace not giuen to all: you ſée Pharaoh héere, and ſuch hath the world many, whom no preaching can reforme. &amp;c.
                     5. Ver. 8. vnto the 13. you ſée the ſixth plague of Egypt, Verſe 8. The 6. plague. Verſe. 9. 2. Antiq. ca. 13. euen a foule ſcab breaking out into bliſters vpon man, and beaſt. Whereof, Ioſephus ſaith, no ſmall number died, yet could not this moue them to ſée the hand of God. Such vglie ſores and maladies our age alſo hath, and as far from leading to true repentance, as theſe héere. That gréeuous Diſeaſe began in Spaine; but afterward crept into Fraunce, and there ſo abounded, as euer ſince it hath caried the name of that Country, &amp; not of Spaine. Be it, that by diuers meanes it may happen; as, by a cup, a combe, a ſtoole, and ſuch like, ſo that euery one is not guiltie of lewde life, who happily is ſpotted with it; yet, which way ſo euer it commeth, the Lord toucheth, and it is euer good, to ſée his hand diſtinguiſhed from other cauſes, and to fall downe before him, in humble acknowledgement of our ſinne, making our peace by true ſubmiſſion, and beſéeching him either to remoue ſuch puniſhment frō vs, or to ſeale vp our hearts in the aſſurance of his loue, notwithſtanding all earthly trials. Let vs alſo in this place marke, how the Sorcerers were ſmitten with this plague, ſo that they could not ſtand before Moſes.
                         They had ſéene many things before to make them giue place, the deuouring of their roddes, their inhabilitie to make that baſe vermine (ſpoken of before,) yea, their owne mouthes then ſaid, it was Gods Finger; yet they will not giue ouer

their gaine-ſaying, and croſſing of Gods Miniſters, till the Plague of God light vpon their owne perſons, in theſe vglie ſoares, which ſurely is a very effectuall warning to all Kebellers againſt good things, that they giue ouer betimes, and yéeld to God, ſo auoiding his wrathfull ſtripes, either vpon themſelues, or their goods. God is the ſame, as iuſt as euer; as ſtrong as euer; and will fleſh and blood prouoke him? A better courſe ſhalbe our wiſedome.
                     6 This ſeuenth Plague now following, ver. thirtéenth, The 7. Plague. hath alſo his Denunciation, his Execution, and his Effect. Which in order obſerued, will yéelde vs ſundry Meditations. And firſt, the Denunciation will more and more beate into vs the wonderfull hardneſſe of Pharaoh and his People, who neither by any nor all the Plagues before mentioned, of Blood, of Frogges, of Lice, of Flyes, of Moraine, of Botch, could be mooued, and turned to the obedience due from man to God. Can we wonder at waywarde creatures in our times, when wée ſée this? No, no, the heart of man &amp; Woman is a moſt wonderfull peruerſe thing, whē God worketh not: &amp; theſe often Repetitions are made by Gods Spirite, that we ſhould marke it, know it, and continually pray againſt it.
                     7 You ſée God willeth Moſes to Riſe vp early in the 
                        verſe. 13. 
                        morning, and ſtand before Pharaoh, Let the vſe of it be, to teach with what diligence and care God would euer haue his buſineſſe, how he hateth negligence, and looſe ſlubbering ouer what belongeth to our charge, ſaying in plaine tearmes; Curſed be he that doth the worke of the Lord negligently. Miniſters then, foraſmuch as their calling is to doo the worke of God, and to ſtand before Pharaoh; they muſt be diligent, zealous, carefull, and painfull, doing what lieth in them, euer. Magiſtrates alſo muſt doo the like, for they execute not the iudgments of man, but of the Lord: and he will be with them in the cauſe and iudgment. For there is no iniquitie with the Lord our God, neither reſpect of perſons, nor receauinge

of reward. Parents, and Maiſters, doo the worke of God, and therefore they muſt be diligent, calling vpon their children, and families with bleſſed Abraham, to feare the Lord. There bee alſo in Pariſhes Church-Officers, Sworne-men, with ſuch like; who, for their yéere, haue Gods worke in hand, and therefore they ſhould haue a great conſcience to doo their duties diligently, for feare of the curſe aboue mentioned. But ſurely their groſſe dulnes crieth for great vengeance, and I pray God, it reach not to their poſteritie alſo, and to all that they haue gathered together for them. For ſo good Offices, to ſo good vſe, both of the Church, and Common-wealth, cannot be ſo wilfully and wittingly, ſo careleſlie and preſumptuouſlie neglected, as they are, but it will ſmart one day. When thou ſeeſt a thiefe, ſaith God Pſal. 50. 18. in the Pſalme, thou runneſt with him, and thou art a pertaker with the Adulterers. When thou ſeeſt a thiefe, that is, an euill doer any way, thou conſenteſt vnto him; that is, either thou doeſt as he doth, or, at leaſt, doeſt ouerlooke him, and conceale him, not bringing him by thine Office vnto the ordinarie correction of his fault; and haſt beene pertaker with the Adulterers, in not preſenting them, and following the preſentment with zeale, vntill there were Juſtice had. Theſe things, ſaith God, haſt thou done, and I held my tongue, and thou thoughteſt wickedly, that I 
                        Pſal. 50. 21, 
                        am euen ſuch a one as thy ſelfe: but I will reprooue thee, and ſet before thee the things which thou haſt done. That is, I will make thée knowe, and the world alſo ſhall know (by my dealings with thée) that thou haſt not riſen vp earlie in the morning, as Moſes did héere, that is, thou haſt not had care, and conſcience to doo the dutie of thy Place zealouſlie, and carefullie, as thou oughtſt, for his ſake whoſe worke it is, and who hath raiſed thée to credite and accompt; for thy Prince his ſake, who watcheth ouer thée for thy peace, and is greatly abuſed by thée; for thy Countrie ſake, which by thy negligence becommeth wicked and ſinfull, haſtening to deſtruction moſt due and deſerued.

                        Oh, conſider this better, you that feare God, ſaith the place, Pſal. 50. 22. 
                        leſt I PLVCKE YOV AVVAY (or teare you in peeces) and there be none that can deliuer you.
                     
                     8 Obſerue againe the word, All, in the 14. verſe. when Verſe 14. God ſaith: I will at this time ſend all my plagues vppon thine heart) meaning, many ſundry and ſeuerall plagues; for God did not bring All (according to y• 
                        Letter) diuers others following after, as the 8. 9. &amp; 10. Plague. The vſe is this, that wee conſider the perill of rebellious obſtinacy againſt God: For firſt he wil puniſh it with one rodde, then with another, (happely) with a thirde; and if theſe ſingle chaſtiſements will not ſerue, then will he go to many plagues, heaping wrath vpon wrath, and woe vppon woe, with a fierce hand; yea, he will lay euen All his plagues vpon vs at once, as he here ſpeaketh, to our greatfall, and confuſion. Add vnto this proofe here, thoſe wordes in Deut. But if thou wilt not obey the voice of 
                        Deut. 28. 15. 
                        THE LORD THY GOD, to keepe and to doe all his Commaundements and his Ordinances, which I commaund thee this daie, then all theſe curſes (not one, or two, but All theſe curſes) ſhall come vpon thee and ouertake thee. Curſed ſhalt thou be in the towne, and curſed 
                        16 17 18. 
                        in the field. Curſed ſhall thy basket be, and thy dough. Curſed ſhall be the fruite of thy body, and the fruite of thy land, the increaſe of thy kine, and the flockes of thy Sheepe. Curſed ſhalt thou be when thou commeſt in, 
                        19. 2. 
                        and curſed when thou goeſt out. The Lord ſhall ſend vppon thee curſing, trouble, and ſhame in al that which thou ſetteſt thine hand to doo, vntill thou be deſtroyed, and periſh quickly, becauſe of the wickedneſſe of thy workes, whereby thou haſt forſaken me. Take we héede therfore, we were beſt, of Pharaohs obſtinacy, &amp; diſobedience againſt God, againſt his Worde, and againſt his Seruaunts and meſſengers ſent vnto vs, for our good; leſt this heape of curſes light vpon vs, and euen All the Lords plagues puniſh vs. Wee may note againe, how he calleth them his

plagues, ſaying, all my plagues; and learne thereby, that neither Fortune, nor Chaunce ruleth rods and croſſes layd vpon vs: but theſe thinges ſtill are Gods tooles, whereby he either boweth or breaketh men &amp; women that are warped, and caſt aſide, being (by him) layde on, and taken off, at his pleaſure. So ſaid our Sauiour to his Perſecutor, thou 
                        Math. 26. 
                        couldeſt haue no power ouer mee, except it were giuen thee from aboue. This well remembred, will make vs ſée and diſcerne God in our ſicknes, in our loſſe of friends, or goods, in our woes, and wants whatſoeuer they be, and the ſooner ſtoope vnder his hand, and be turned to his will. Our hearts will ſay within vs, This is Gods hand, this is his blowe; O ſoule, turne, turne, and be reformed, thou maiſt goe no further in this way, thou maiſt not reſiſt him, that is too ſtrong for thée. Witches, Sorcerers, Théeues, Robbers, Raylers, Slaunderers, and Oppreſſours whatſoeuer, that haue done mee wrong, I looke not at them, otherwiſe than at God his rods: for all plagues, I ſée in this Text, are his plagues, and he ruleth all, caſting theſe rods into the fire, when his childe is humbled, and reformed. Bleſſed therefore is the man that feareth alway: but hee that hardeneth his heart; ſhall fall into euill. 
                        Pro. 28. 14,
                     
                     9. God ſaith hee will ſend all theſe plagues vpon his heart, which (beſides the Note in your Bibles margine) may ſignifie, that they ſhould touch him inwardly, and déepely: ſo doth God daily, where he is angrie, and ſo can God doo with vs, if wee prouoke him. To ſmite vs in armes, hands, legges, or the like parts is gréeuous vnto vs and bitter; but when ſorrowe is laide vpon the heart, it ſtingeth indéede, and moſt bitterly, which He would expreſſe, that ſaid; Sorrowe hath pierced my head, ſhewed it ſelfe at the windowes, and ſunke downe to my heart. Degrées of woe all bitter, but the laſt moſt of all to be feared: for looke what the moath is to the garment, and the worme to the wood; ſuch is the ſorrowe of the heart. And therefore ſaith Salomon againe, Sorrowe or heauines in

the heart of man, doth bring it downe: and in another place, A ſorrowfull minde drieth the bones: And, by the 
                        Pro. 17. 2

                        ſorrowe of the heart the minde is heauie. Poets would expreſſe as much, when they termed ſorrowe and care, eating and biting. The way to preuent this dolefull ſorrowe of heart, laide on by an angrie God, is, to take our ſinnes to heart betimes, and (by true repentance) to f

                     10. The 16. and 17. verſes, to our great good, inſtruct verſe. 16, 17. vs concerning wicked men; that indéede, as Pharaoh héere, ſo are they appointed of God, and they can doo but what He will haue them, howſoeuer yet they, not conſidering thus much, exalt themſelues againſt Gods people often, as héere did this Tyrant. Feare not therefore their feare, but ſettle this doctrine ſoundly in your harts, &amp; leaue all to God. Hee that raiſed them, for his Will, can kéepe them within the limits of his Will, and that Will to vs can neuer be hurtfull, if wee dutifully commend our ſelues to it.
                     11. Thus God hath giuen Pharaoh warning, what Judgements are hanging ouer his head, readie forthwith to fall vpon him, vnleſſe he yéeld to diſmiſſe his people out of Egypt. Yet ſée, and neuer forget it, whileſt you liue; In the middeſt of all this wrath, the Lord remembreth mercie: And biddeth them be warned, to ſend for their 
                        Verſe 19. 
                        Cattell into the houſe, for feare of the haile, which was to come. For vpon all the men, &amp; beaſts, which were found abroade, ſhould the hayle fall, and they die. Why? what then? ſhould not all this haue béene moſt iuſt in God, they being ſo rebellious ſinners? It is very true, if they had all died, it had béene moſt iuſt. Neuertheleſſe, euen to ſuch ſinners, the Lord would haue his mercie extended. And therefore, if euer any man or woman ſhall doubt of mercy from ſuch a God, it is a wrong, it is a ſinne intollerable. For, he that is thus to Lyons raging and roaring againſt him, can hee be hard to his little Lambes, that religiouſlie

truſt in him? Shall you, and I, be caſt away, when Pharaoh is reſpected? No, it hath not béene, it ſhall not be, it connot be ſo with the Lord. Quicke is the eye of him, to ſée the feares of his Children, euer, and with a tender hart he ſendeth comfort, in his good time. Déere and gracious Father, confirme the hearts of thy little Flocke, in the ſwéete aſſurance of this thy goodnes, euermore, and in my bleſſed Sauiour, thy beloued Sonne: accept the hidden thankfull thoughts of my ſoule, for what I haue found at thy gracious hand, in mine owne particular, and pardon my wants, Amen, Amen.
                     
                     12 Such then as feared the word of the Lord among the ſeruaunts of Pharaoh,
                         ſaith the Text, made his Seruants 
                        verſe. 20. 
                        &amp; Cattell fly into the houſes: But ſuch as regarded not the 
                        21. 
                        word of the Lord, left his ſeruāts, &amp; his cattel in the field. Quare grandinem illaturus, denunciauit illis, vti pecora domū cogerent? Dominus cum ſit humaniſſimus, miſerecordia temperat ſuppplica. Alioqui etiam nouerat quoſdam eſſe venia dignos, quod non tacet Scriptura Diuina. Qui enim, ait, ex ſeruis Pharaonis timuit verbum domini, peccora ſua domum coegit, &amp;c. Why did the Lord (being purpoſed to bring haile vpon them) admoniſh them to fetch their cattell into the houſe? Euen becauſe hee, being moſt gentle, would temper puniſhment with mercie. And againe he knew there were ſome differing from others, more to be reſpected, which the Scripture doth not conceale, when it ſaith, So many of Pharaoh his Seruants as feared the word of the Lord, fetched their Cattell into the houſe, &amp;c. As followeth in Theodoret, and Saint Aguſtine vpon this place. Such, and ſo diuerſe is the fruite of the ſelfe ſame worde of God, ſpoken at one time, by one man, to one people. Some regard it, and doo thereafter; ſome neglect, and doo contrarie. The greateſt Moſes muſt reckon of this, and being forewarned, be alſo forearmed againſt the diſcōfort yt followeth of it. Let the people alſo obſerue, yt ſuch only are ſaide here to feare the word of the Lord, as did obey it, and fetch their Cattell in, according to it. Looke therefore euer

at obedience, and iudge thereby of your heart: at the leaſt, looke at ye willingnes of your hart, to obey, though humane frailety cauſe ſome imperfectiō. When Ioſiah his hart melted, 
                        2. King. 22. 19. Act. 2. 37. Luke. 24. 32. when thoſe Iewes harts were pricked, &amp; whē 
                        thoſe Trauellers harts burned in the way to EMMAVS; then was it wel, you know, with al of them: And ſuch féeling muſt euer make vs well alſo. For there be too many that (ſay Moſes what the can) will fetch neither ſeruants, nor cattell into ye houſe, to whō it ſhal happen, (one day) as ſuredly, as here it did to ye Egyptians. Uengeance ſhal come down one way, or other, and light vpon them, as here did thunder, &amp; hayle, 
                        Ver. 23. 24. 
                        and fire, and lightning vpon the deſpiſers of Moſes warning. For, with an heard heart, ſaith the Wiſe-man, it ſhal 
                        Sirac. 3. 27. 
                        neuer be well in the end. If a condemned man ſhould refuſe his Prince his gratious pardon, died he not iuſtly? If a beſieged Citie ſhould refuſe offered aide, periſhed it not worthelie? So ſtandeth it with Contemners of the word, which is a gratious pardon for all our offences, and a ſauing ayde to our beſieged ſoules. When a ſicke man refuſeth meate, we doubt of his well-doing; but if he féede well, wee hope of life. So is it with vs, if we receiue the Word, or refuſe the Word. For he that is of God, ſaith our Sauiour, heareth Gods word; and who ſo will not, as ſure a ſigne it is, on the other ſide. For you therefore heare not, becauſe ye are not of GOD. A fiſh freſh and ſwéete is knowne by the eare being freſh and ſwéete; and ſo is euer a good Chriſtian. Search then your ſelfe by this Rule, and you ſhall profit either to prayer, for what you miſſe; or to thankes-giuing, for what you finde. In the eye of Chriſt, it was ſo bleſſed a thing to heare &amp; obey the word, 
                        Luke. 11. 28. that he pronounced happineſſe rather to ſuch, than to the wombe that bare him, and the paps that gaue him ſucke. A moouing ſpéech, if we haue any life in vs.
                     13. Then Moſes ſtretched out his rod towards Heauen, 
                        ver. 23. 
                        and the Lord ſent thunder, and hayle, and lightning, vpon the ground: and the Lord cauſed hayle to raine vppon

the land of Egypt. So there was hayle, &amp; fire mingled with the hayle, ſo grieuous as there was none throughout all the land of Egypt, ſince it was a Nation. Of which ſtrange Plague many things are written, which I will cut off, ſéeking onely to make ſome profitable vſe vnto vs of it. Grandinem &amp; fulgura immiſit illis, oſtendens, quòd ipſe

Ob id meri to Deus omniū, non ſolū per fluuiū, &amp; terram, ſed per aërem, &amp; mare, caſtigauit eos: &amp; flumina coelitùs illis immiſit; docēs, quòd ipſeſit Dominus &amp; Creator omnium, quod &amp; beatus Moſes dixit, vt cognoſcas, quód Domini ſit terra, &amp; tu, &amp; ſerui tui. He ſent vpon them, Hayle and Lightning, to ſhew that he was Lord of all the elements. For both the Egyptians and Graecians had a conceipt, that there were ſome Gods of the Heauens, ſome of the earth, and ſome vnder the earth; that one ſort ruleth the Earth, an other ſort the Sea; one ſort the Mountaines, another ſort the fields. Wherefore, that Syrian ſaid, the God of Iſrael is the God of mountaines, &amp; not of vallies. Wherefore God rightly heere chaſtiſed thē not only by the Waters, and the Earth, but by the Ayre alſo, and the Sea: and ſent Thunder &amp; Lightning frō Heauen vpon them; that ſo he might teach, and ſhew, that he is Lord and Creator of all things. Which bleſſed Moſes ſaid in thoſe words to Pharaoh, that thou mighteſt know, how the Earth, and Thou, and thy Seruants, are in the Lords power.
                         Let it make vs ſoundly ſettle in our hearts, euer, both what héere we ſée, and what other Scriptures teſtifie of Him. He raineth downe ſnares, fire, brimſtone, ſtorme, and tempeſt, And, it is the Lord that commaundeth 
                        Pſal. 11. 6. Pſal. 29. 3. 
                        the waters, it is the glorious God that maketh the thunder. Fire and hayle, ſnow and vapours, winde and 
                        Pſal. 148. 8. 
                        ſtorme fulfill his word. Whether therefore wee be hindered,

or furthered by weather, let vs euer caſt vp our eyes to Heauen: for it is the Lord ſtill, that ruleth theſe things, and by his Will they come, and goe. Nature is His ſeruant, and the Deuill is His rod; neither of them working, but as he appointeth. The very Heathens had a glimpſe of this truth, when they taught Aeolus to be God of the winde, and Neptune God of the Sea; ſuppoſing, that by ſome God theſe things muſt be gouerned. Thinke then of the yéere 1588. and poure out his praiſe, that ſo gouerned theſe things for our comfort. On the other ſide, when ſo euer they ſhall croſſe our affaires, either by Sea, or Land, ſtoope we to Him in humilitie, ſearch out our wayes, what wee knowe amiſſe, and amend it ſpéedily, that the Lord may rebuke both winde, and ſea for our profit. Furthermore in this, that the Lord ſent this plague of thunder and lightning vpon the Egyptians, let vs learne, how he commeth not ſtealing, to wrath and iudgement againſt rebellious ſinners, but ratling and ſhaking both Heauen and Earth. The fruite whereof ſhould bee, to make vs feare to offend. For, I will make the eares of whoſoeuer heareth to tingle, ſaith the Lord, at that which I will doo: 
                        Ier. 19. 3. ſo noting a fierce, &amp; fearefull publique procéeding againſt ſinne, and ſinners, as it were vpon Stages, &amp; houſe tops, not in darknes and in ſecret. Againe, fire was mingled with hayle, to teach, that his Judgements ſhall not bee ſingle, but euen one vpon the necke of another, vntill wee be either humbled, or deſtroyed, according vnto his will. One Example of many, that are in Gods Booke, and other Hiſtories, may ſuffice. Haman, that wicked enemie of the Church, &amp; true Religion, was at length to taſte of Gods Juſtice for his ſinnes: and how commeth the Lord againſt him? cloſely &amp; couertly? No, but euen with thunder, and lightning, as héere, againſt Pharaoh: that is, with open, and great ſhew, to all men, of his wrath. For firſt, he is made to leade his horſe, in honour of him, whom of all men he moſt maliced: ſecondly, hee falleth iuſtlie into

his Princes heauie indignation, and when hee humblie ſued at the Quéenes féete for pardon, hee was taken by the King, as intending high villanie, which encreaſed the Kings wrath mightily: thirdly, he is diſpatched away, to be hanged vpon that Gallowes, which (in his greatnes) he had prepared for another: fourthly, his houſe and Land, his honour, and offices were all giuen away, where hee leaſt wiſhed them; and yet the Lord ſtayed not héere, but fearefully deſtroyed alſo his poſteritie. Was not this thundering? was not this lightning? and was not this Judgment, as vpon a ſtage? O let it euer be remembred of all that reade it with their eies; and God, for his mercy ſake, make it profitable.
                     14 Only in the land of Goſhen (where the children of 
                        verſe. 26. 
                        Iſrael were) was no hayle. In which words, as heretofore, ſo ſtil ſtil is noted the vnſearchable goodneſſe of God to his Church, together with his Almighty power, to doo euer what He wil. He can ſaue, and He can ſpill; He can make ſuch a wall about his children, that no ſtorme, or tempeſt, no calamitie, or euill ſhall come nere them, though it compaſſe them round about, and others periſh with it, on euery ſide. Two ſhall be in the fielde, the one receaued, the other forſaken; two ſhall be grinding at the mill, the one accepted, the other reiected, &amp;c. Bleſſed therefore is that man and woman, who haue the Lord for their God; And ſay vnto my ſoule, I am thy ſaluation, ſaith Dauid, in one of his Pſalmes: noting thereby the comfort of this, aboue ten thouſand worldes. Let vs therefore euer be carefull to be of the number of thoſe, that abide in Goſhen, where the Sauing hand of God ſhall defend from al euil.
                     15. In theſe ſmooth wordes of Pharaoh, verſe. 27. (That he had ſinned, that the Lord was righteous, and he, 
                        verſe. 27. 
                        and his people wicked; That Moſes ſhould pray for him, &amp;c. returning neuertheleſſe to his old byas when the Plague was gone;) ſtil obſerue (as you haue done before) the déepe falſhood of mans hart, making faire ſhewes without

fruite; and if God be thus glozed and diſſembled with all, thinke, whether it ſéeme ſtrange to mortall man, to taſte of it? No, no, we muſt reckon of it, to be praiſed to our face, to be ſclaundered at our backes, by the one and the ſame perſon. Yet let it not diſcourage vs to doo any good, but onely let it make vs carefull, to giue no iuſt cauſe, and tenne thouſand times thankfull, when wee are releaſed out of ſuch a world, and taken into his kingdome.
                     16. Laſtly, that often repeated Sentence of Pharaohs heardened heart, let it remember vs of that Saying in Saint Auguſtine, Corda mala, patientia Dei, dureſcunt. Euill hearts wax-heard by Gods long-ſuffering and patience. Alſo, of that in Saint Bernard, Cor durum dici, quod non cōpūctione ſcinditur, nec pietate mollitur, nec mouetur precibus, minis non cedit, flagellis duratur, ingratum ad beneficia, ad conſilia infidum, ad iudicia ſaeuum, inuerecundum ad turpia, impauidum ad pericula, inhumanum ad humana, temerarium ad Diuina, preteritorum obliuiſcens, praeſentium negligens, &amp; futura non praeuidens. It is called a heard heart, which is neither rent with compunction, nor ſoftned with piety, nor mooued with prayers, which giueth no place to threatnings, is hardened with ſtripes, in benefits vnthankfull, in Councill vnfaithfull, in iudgment cruell, vnſhamefaſt in foule things, not fearefull in perils, in humane things moſt inhumane, in Diuine things raſhe, forgetting things paſt, neglecting things preſent, and not foreſeeing things to come. Surely ſuch a deſcription (if we our ſelues haue not Pharaohs hardnes) will euer mooue vs, earneſtly to pray againſt ſuch hardneſſe. Thus endeth this Chapter, and thus end I, hauing giuen you ſome taſte, how we may profit by reading of it.

                           Againe the Lord ſaid vnto Moſes, goe to Pharaoh, &amp;c. Diuers times, you know, hee had ſent before, and all in vaine; yet ceaſeth not the bottomleſſe and incomprehenſible mercy of God, ſtill, ſtill, againe and againe to ſend. This was euer his gratious dealing with miſerable ſinners, and a ſwéete comfort it is to a troubled minde to thinke of it. The Goſpell ſaith in like ſort, He ſentagaine 
                           Luke. 20. 9. &amp;c. 
                           and againe, other and other ſeruants to thoſe wicked husbandmen, to remember them of his due, and their duetie; At laſt he ſent his owne Sonne vnto them, ſaying, they will reuerence my Sonne. Againe, to Hieruſalem, 
                           Luke. 13. 34. 
                           how often, how often would I haue gathered thy Children together, euen as a Hen gathereth her chickens vnder her wings, and yet would not? O tender Father! what a certaine Seale is this thy goodneſſe in theſe examples, that true Repentance ſhall neuer be reiected, A ſorrowfull ſinner neuer repulſed, a broken and contrite hart neuer deſpiſed? Let it profit vs vnto increaſe of faith, for

his ſake that dyed for our ſinnes. Our owne experience hath taught vs as much, if wee did obſerue it. For how long haue wee béene ſinners? haue not ſome of vs béene 20 yéeres, ſome 30, ſome 40, and more (all of vs too long) walking the way, that leadeth vnto death? And what haue our ſinnes béene? ſurely great, foule, vglie, odious to God, dangerous to our ſelues, and offenſiue to the world: yet hath the Lord neither ſwept vs away in his moſt iuſt wrath, neither ceaſed to ſend Moſes againe and againe vnto vs, for our reformation. Should not this infinite goodnes much moue vs, to returne to ſo ſwéete a Father? Knoweſt 
                           Rom. 2. 4. 
                           thou not (O man) ſaith the bleſſed Apoſtle, that the long ſuffering of God leadeth thee to repentance? How entertained hee the Prodigall Sonne when hee returned? how reioice the Angels in Heauen, ouer one ſinner, that repenteth? far be it euer then from vs, euer to reſiſt a God ſo powerfull to confound vs, and ſo mercifull to receaue vs.
                        2. But the Lord ſaith héere, that he hardened Pharaohs heart, and the hearts of his ſeruants, how then was the fault in them, that they yéelded not? for anſwere, let mee aſke you another queſtion: whether you thinke it not lawfull, that God ſhould puniſh a ſinner, as himſelfe liketh? and whether hardnes of heart be not a puniſhment? if both be true, then might the Lord puniſh him this way. Yet all men doo not thinke this ſuch a puniſhment as it is; for, if wee be ſicke, wee looke for helpe, if the eye faile, the eare growe dull, or any ſenſe be weakened, we quickly féele it, and readily with for remedie; onely, if our heart growe dull, and our vnderſtanding, féeling, and profiting in Gods Schoole be taken from vs, wee are not mooued, neither thinke it goeth ill with vs, preferring the outward ſenſe of body far and far before the light of the minde. But let it be lawfull, you ſay, with the Lord thus to puniſh; yet it muſt néedes excuſe the partie ſo puniſhed: for, how can a man féele, and relent, whoſe heart God ſmiteth with hardnes?

no, it excuſeth not, becauſe a man may ſinne neceſſarily, and yet not conſtrainedly, but willingly; which conſent Neceſſario, non coacte. of will maketh him guiltie: as in common experience, you ſée one in a great heate drinke neceſſarily, in reſpect of heate; yet not conſtrainedly, but very willingly. Looke not therefore at Gods ſecret Decrée, but at mans willing approbation of what is euill. And in this matter remember the modeſtie, and reuerence of S. Paule, when he ſaith; O man, who art thou that pleadeſt with God? ſhall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, why haſt thou 
                           Rom. 9. 20. &amp;c. 
                           made me thus? &amp;c. O the deepenes of the riches, both of the wiſedome and knowledge of God! how vnſearchable 
                           Rom. 11. 33. 
                           are his Iudgements, and his waies paſt finding out! Remember alſo howe S. Auguſtine imitateth him in this vertue, ſaying, O man, thou lookeſt for an aunſwere of me, and I alſo am a man my ſelfe; therefore let vs both heare him that ſaith, Who art thou that diſputeſt with GOD? Better is holy ignorance, than raſh knowledge, 
                           Melior est fidelis ignorantia, quam temeraria ſcientia. 
                           Seeke thou for merit, thou ſhalt finde but puniſhment. O deepenes! reaſon thou, I will meruaile; diſpute thou, I will beleeue: and hee that liketh not of this anſwere, let him ſéeke one more learned, but take héede, hee finde not one more preſuming.
                        3. That thou maiſt declare in the eares of thy ſonne, and thy ſonnes ſonne, what things I haue done in Egypt; 
                           Ver. 2. 
                           &amp;c. A Notable place to teach vs, as the end of Gods workes and wonders, ſo the dutie and office of all Chriſtian Parentes and Gouernours: euen to teach their Children and Charge, carefully and zealouſlie by them, and in them to knowe the Lord. The like place you haue againe, in Deuteronomie. Theſe wordes, which I commaund 
                           Deut. 6. 6 7. 
                           thee this day, ſhall bee in thine heart. And thou ſhalt rehearſe them continually vnto thy children, and ſhalt talke of them when thoutarieſt in thine houſe, and as thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lieſt downe, and when thou riſeſt vp: &amp;c. Thus is God himſelfe the

Author of that Catechizing and inſtructing of youth, in his holy feare, and true Religion, which ſo much is neglected in our daies, and whereunto not onely youth (who knowe not their owne good) are hardly drawne; but euen their elder Parents and Maiſters are very vnwilling to haue them drawne. But can the ſtubborne and headſtrong contempt of ſo holy a Commaundement of him that made vs be euer vnpuniſhed? no, no, it both hath, and euer ſhall haue his due correction, both in thoſe that ſhould come, and thoſe that ſhould ſend them, and ſée them come, Parents, Maiſters, Godfathers, and Godmothers, and the like. Hence it commeth, that children are often diſobedient to their Parents, wanton, wilfull, wicked, and in the end die a ſhamefull death. Parents can get for their Sonnes the Landlords Cloath, thereby to haue countenance and aide in the world; but they neuer caſt, nor care to get them Gods holy feare in their hearts, who is Landlord of all Lands, and Lords, thereby to haue both the promiſe of this life, and of that to come. O blindnes! doo we not ſée, how great, and how foule, how groſſe, and how ſinfull? if we doo, let vs héereafter amend this fault, and aſſure our ſelues, that all the countenance in the world is not like his fauour, that made both our poſteritie, and the world; ruleth them, and the world; deſtroyeth them, and the world. Wherefore he promiſed it to Abraham, as a thing aboue all the riches of the world, that he would be his God, and the God of his ſeede, if he walked before him in vprightnes. Follow this Meditation further in your owne minde, and you ſhall finde it worke to a carefull courſe, touching ſuch as are committed to you.

Theſe wordes tell vs the drift of all croſſes and afflictions in this life; euen to bring downe the ſwelling pride of our ſinfull hearts: that yéelding God what is due to him, we againe from him might reape mercie and goodnes more and more, to our endleſſe comfort: for he would

                           if they could haue bene founde, the whole Citie had bene ſaued. Houſes and whole kingdomes haue bene fauoured for one righteous man dwelling therein, proofes are many both in Scripture &amp; all Stories, Ioſeph, Daniel, and ſuch like.
                        7 This ſpéech of Pharaohs ſeruants preuailed ſo farre, that Moſes and Aaron were ſent for to Pharaoh, and had Verſe 8. an offer made them, to depart, if they would, with ſome company, but not with all: vnto which Moſes anſwered, that they muſt néedes all goe, Young and old, Sons and Daughters, ſheepe and cattell, orels none. Wherein I profit thus, by the graunt of Pharaoh of ſome to goe, and not all; I obſerue the malice of Satan, and his members, againſt the Church and the true ſeruice of God: if they cannot wholly deſtroy it, hurt it, and hinder it; then in part as farre as they can, they will doo it, euer valuing much, but a little gaine herein. By the anſwere of Moſes, I obſerue againe, on the other ſide, that we muſt not yéelde an inch to theſe plottes and fetches of the wicked, but zealouſly muſt ſtand vpon the full obſeruance of all Gods Will, according to his commaundement, and not according to the fancies either of others, or of our ſelues. Where the Lord diſpenſeth not, wée muſt not diſpenſe; where al are bound to departe out of Egypt, we muſt not capitulate, for ſome to goe, and ſome to tarrie. Whereof, would God, men in our dais had due conſideration: where the Huſband goeth to Church, but not the wife; the Father, but not the Sonne; the Seruant, but not the Maiſter: Moſes would not doo thus, in this place, but (knowing all to be bound) requireth all; leauing vs therein a fearefull aſſurance, that this playing at halfe ſtake with the Lord, as it is moſt odious to him, ſo moſt dreadfully by him it will one day be puniſhed.
                        8. The wordes following in the eleuenth verſe. are not to be paſſed ouer without ſome profit, Then they were

So were the Prophets and Apoſtles in their times; yea, the great Maiſter himſelfe, when they forcibly caried him toward the top of a mountaine with a purpoſe violently to haue caſt him downe. But let it comfort vs, and ſhake the hearts of ſuch wicked wretches euer, that the very duſt of our féete ſhall bee a witneſſe for vs againſt them in the great day of iuſt iudgment, and due reuenge for ſuch ſinne. He that receaueth you receaueth me; and he that refuſeth, (and thruſteth you out) refuſeth, (and thruſteth me out.) Vengeance is mine, and I will repay.
                        
                        9 By occaſion of theſe Graſhoppers, ſent in the wrath Verſe. 15. The 8. Plague. of God, as a Plague to annoy the Egyptians, couering All the face of the earth (by their multitude) till the land was darke with them, and eating vp all the hearbes of the land, with the fruits of the trees, &amp;c. You may take occaſion to remember what you reade of Graſhoppers in the Scriptures; and you may heare alſo what others haue ſaide of them. Firſt, you find in Leuiticus a kinde of Graſhopper 
                           Leuit. 11. 22. among the cleane beaſts, which the Iſraelites might eat of: whereunto referre that in Mathew of Iohn Baptiſt, 
                           Matth. 3. 4. how his meate was Locuſts, that is, Graſhoppers, and wilde hony. This kinde of Graſhopper, to vs, at this dale, is not well knowne, as neither to others before our time. For Theophilact vpon Math, ſuppoſeth Iohns Locuſts to haue béene hearbes ſo called, and Euthimius vpon Math, Certaine wilde fruites, ſuch as the wilderneſſe, wherein Iohn liued, yéelded vnto him. Chriſoſtome and Athanaſius before him were of the ſame opinion, ſaith Hermolaus Barbarus. But Saint Hillary thinketh they were Animalia quaedam apta ad comedendum, Certaine liuing creatures good for meate. Thomas Aquinas vpon Mathew hath the ſame wordes. Albertus Magnus vppon Math, That they were not our vſuall Graſhoppers; for

they (ſaith hee) are venemous: but they were certaine Birdes in the Wildernes, which vpon ſimilitude of their leaping and hopping (rather than flying) were called Graſhoppers. Plinie in his Naturall Hiſtorie writeth, that Graſhoppers or Locuſts to the Parthians, were moſt acceptable meat: againe, in another place, yt a part of Aethiopia liueth onely by Locuſts made hard by ſmoake and ſalt. But they Fumo &amp; ſale duratis. liue not, ſaith he, aboue 40. yéeres. S. Hierome ſaith, that the Eaſterne people &amp; Enhabitants of Libya eate much theſe Graſhoppers: becauſe in the Deſert, &amp; hote vaſtnes of the Wildernes, there are found cloudes of them. Plinie 
                           Nubes Locuſtarum. againe writeth of them, that there are of 3. foote long in India. The word alſo, Locusta, we knowe, is ſometimes taken for the fiſh which we call a Lobſter. In the Apocalyps you reade, that the bottomleſſe pit was opened, and 
                           Apoc. 9. 2. 
                           out of the ſame aroſe a ſmoake like the ſmoake of a great fornace. And out of the ſmoake came Locuſts (or Graſhoppers,) vpon the earth, &amp;c. Where you may conſider 3. what is meant by theſe Locuſts, and then the reaſon of their reſemblance. Theſe Locuſts prefigured and foretold to the Church of God all that rabble of the Popiſh Clergie, which afterward, in time, couered (as it were) the face of the earth, their Prieſts, their ſwarmes of Monkes, Fryers, Nunnes, &amp; other Orders, almoſt without number. For héere is mention made of a Starre that fell; nowe Starres (in this booke) doo ſignifie the Angels of the Churches, Apoc. 9. 1. who ſhine by the light of Heauenly doctrine, and holie life, as ſtarres in the firmament by their brightnes; and who truly may be ſaid to ſtand, whileſt they doo their duties; and to fall from Heauen, when (forgetting life, and doctrine) they thinke, ſpeake, and followe earthly things. The Starre therefore, that is héere ſaid to fall from Heauen vnto the earth, was ſome great Miniſter in the Church, of ſuch authoritie, and high eſtimation, as the power aſcribed vnto him plainly teacheth. But who, in all the world, can bee named ſuch a One, ſauing the Biſhop of

                           Rome? for, by all Stories wee ſée, and knowe, that they were excellent men, at the beginning, many of them, yea vnto Conſtantine the Great, as I remember, 32 succéeded one after another, good, and learned men; holy, and reuerend Martyrs, for the ſelfe ſame truth, which wee at this day holde, and their Succeſſors haue forſaken. From Conſtantine againe to Gregory the Great about 32 more, good men, though not altogether as the former. For euen now began ſome declination in the Church, yet not ſuch, but that Gregorie deteſted the proude Supremacie, which now is challenged, and tolde the Biſhop of Conſtantinople (then ambitiouſlie ſéeking for it,) that whoſoeuer ſought to bee called Vniuerſall Biſhop was (out of queſtion) the Forerunner of Antichriſt. But, when Boniface the Third came, he little paſſing for Gregorie his opinion, obtained of Phocas, (that bloodie Traytor, who had killed the Emperour his Maiſter, his Wife, and Children, and ſo got to bee Emperour) that Rome might bee the Head of all Cities, and the Biſhop there, vniuerſall Biſhop ouer all. Here then fell the Starre from Heauen to Earth, when it left Heauen, and claue to the Earth, hunting continually for earthly honour ſince that day, and plotting earthly trouble to all Nations. The brightnes of Doctrine, and holy life, which former Biſhops of Rome had, and thereby did ſhine as ſtarres, was now loſt: and all idle inuentions of mans ſinfull braine brought in to worſhip God with them, in ſteade of his owne Commaundements. Great power to hurt retained, hauing not nowe Peters keyes (as they boaſt,) but the keyes of the bottomleſſe pit giuen them, to bring out thence into the Church Doctrines of Deuils, 
                           1. Timoth. 4. 1. 2. 3. darknes, ignorance, ſuperſtition, and all wicked abhominations, like ſoule thicke ſmoake hiding the brightnes and light of Chriſt our Sauiour from the eyes of men, euen ſo ſtrongly, that ſuch ſmoake is reſembled to the ſmoake of a great fornace, for the ſtrength of it. What groſſe lyes, what palpable Fables, haue their Legends, their elder

                           Maſſe-Bookes, and Primers, printed long ſince? ſurely euen ſuch, as themſelues, at this day, are aſhamed of, and leaue out of their new Bookes. Then out of this filthie foggie ſmoake aſcending out of the pit, when it was opened, came the ſwarmes of Locuſts mentioned, Monkes, Fryers, &amp;c. No Papiſt in the world can ſhew where (vnder any Starre fallen) there is ſuch a reſemblance as vnder their Pope hath béene, and is at this day ſtill: which being the ſecond point I prayed you to marke, now caſt your eyes vpon it, and marke it much. Firſt, Graſhoppers doo moſt of their hurt by their mouthes; and ſo doth Romiſh Lucuſts by their curſed ſpeaking; teaching, charming, and alluring Chriſtian people from GOD, from Prince, and Countrie, to their damnable opinions, and reſolutions. This Spéech of their mouthes maketh mee remember S. Bernards Spéech, Bestia illa cui datum est es loqūens blasphemias, &amp; bellum gevere cum ſanctis, Petri cathedram occupat tanquam Leo paratus ad praedam. That beaſt vnto which there is giuen a mouth to ſpeake blaſphemies, and to warre with the Saints, poſſeſſeth the Chayre of Peter, as a Lyon prepared to his pray.
                            A great Spéech in thoſe dayes, if you marke it.
                        Secondly, Graſhoppers vſe to ſwarme in great abundance, whereupon came the Prouerbe, As thicke, as Graſhoppers. So theſe Romiſh Locuſts did they not ouer-ſpread (as it were) the whole earth, when vnder Pope Pius the 2, one order of Fryers (called Minorits) ſo abounded, &amp; ſwarmed, that the Maiſter of the Order offered the Pope, either againſt the Turke, or for any other ſeruice, thirtie Thouſand able fighting men, and yet would leaue ſo manie more? What Swarmes, thinke you, were amongſt all the Orders, if one were ſo great? very fitly therefore did the Similitude of Locuſts foretell this rabble, in time, to come into the world.
                        Thirdly, Graſhoppers doo eate-vp &amp; deſtroy all greene things, and fruites of the earth: And euen ſo theſe Antichriſtian 
                           Ioel. 2.
                           
                           Locuſts, Swarmes of Romiſh Fryers, and ſuch like, left not a greene thing vndeuoured, that is, not a good ſoyle, and ſeate in any Land, wherein they clapt not downe themſelues, had a houſe built, and poſſeſſed the pleaſure, and profit thereof, till God (in mercy to his Church) ſent a ſtrong winde, and blew them away.
                        
                        Fourthly, Graſhoppers are ſaid, and written of, to be inſatiable, euer hungry, whileſt they liue; Locusta enim quaſi tota vena est, &amp; ideo inſatiabilis; quam diu viuit, ſemper eſurit.
                            And were not the Romiſh Locuſts ſo to (I pray you) in their time, and yet ſtill are, where they haue place? The world, with many wofull complaints, hath left their inſatiable deuouring teſtified to all poſterity.
                        Fiftly, one Graſhopper, alone, is very contemptible, and no man feareth him, but (in Swarmes) they are as terrible, on the other ſide, to a whole Land. Euen ſo Romiſh Locuſts, Prieſts, Fryers, and ſuch like, one of any ſort, alone, without dread; but beware heapes &amp; Swarmes of them, for by their multitude they haue dared, and wronged great Princes.
                        Sixtly, the Graſhoppers leape, and ſing, and play all Sommer long: ſo did theſe rabble plentifully take their pleaſure all the time of their Sommer, liued in idlenes, vpon other mens labours, ſinging, and ſaying; ſporting, and playing; and who durſt ſay, nay?
                        Laſtly, Locusta est animal paruulum, inter volatile &amp; reptile medium, pestis tanta, vt ab Ethnicis Deorum ira dicatur. The Graſhopper,
                            ſaith Chryſoſtome, neither properly flying, nor creeping, but (as it were) a middle thing betwixt both, ſuch a plague, that the Heathens haue called it, The wrath of God. So write the Papiſts or Romiſh Locuſts of their Head the Pope, that he is neither méerely a man, nor abſolutely, a God; but a middle creature betwixt both: and then wee dare add, that hee is ſuch a plague, as truly we may terme, The wrath of God.
                        
                        Thus might I goe forward in this reſemblance, and

ſhew you how fitly the holy Spirite of God foretold of theſe ſwarmes, vnder the name of Locuſtes: but this much ſheweth you the way, and you your ſelfe may think of mo agréements.
                        Now marke you the wordes in the Reuelation: and as, by this which I haue ſaide, you haue ſéene, how like the Popiſh Clergie is to Graſhoppers in ſome conditions; ſo (there) ſhall you ſee, how like they are to the deſcription of Locuſtes, (there) made by Saint Iohn; that euery way you may be ſure, the Prophecy in the Apocalips noted out theſe creatures.
                        Firſt it is ſaid, vnto them was giuen power, as the Scorpions of the earth haue power. Now we reade, that the Apoc. 9. 3. 
                           Scorpion is a flattering beaſt, and in the middeſt of his flattery with the ſting of his tayle woundeth to death. So were and are theſe Popiſh Locuſtes euer full of flattery, and fawning, and in the middeſt thereof full of poyſon, ſtriking to death (with their ſtings of falſe Doctrine,) as many as they can faſten the ſame in. Againe, the Scorpions ſting (at the firſt) maketh no great payne, but (after it hath crept abroad, and diſperſed his venome in the bodie) it killeth moſt cruelly, and without remedie; ſo the ſtinging perſwaſions of Romiſh Locuſtes appeare not (at firſt) ſo dangerous: but (when they haue gotten ſtrength) the partie hardly euer recouereth. The Doctrine of Free iuſtification in the blood of Chriſt is hid from Gods people, and condemned as hereſie. All aſſurance of Gods fauour, all peace of conſcience, all ioy in the Holy-Ghoſt, quite deſtroyed. Men are ſent to ſéeke eaſe in the Merite of their owne workes, in Popes Pardons, and Indulgences, in running on pilgrimage to this Idoll, and that; in puniſhing their bodies by faſtings, whippings, and ſuch like inuentions; and yet are they not eaſed hereby, but torments of conſcience (as the venome of theſe Scorpion-like Locuſtes, which haue ſtinged them ſtill) remaine bitter, and heauie vpon them. Then muſt they build

Abbeies, giue money for Trentals of Maſſes; then ſing, ſing, ring, ring, caſt Pardons into the graue, call for the poore, giue almes, and what not? Judge now if this kind of power of theſe Locuſtes be not as the power of Scorpions vpon earth, as Saint Iohn ſpeaketh: and be you moſt aſſured, that God pointed at them in this Prophetic, that wee might be forewarned, and ſo forearmed againſt them.
                        Secondly, it is ſaide in the Apocalyps, how to thoſe 
                           Apoc. 9. 4. 
                           Locuſtes was commaunded that they ſhould not hurt the graſſe of the earth, neither any greene thing, neither any tree, but onely thoſe men which haue not the Scale of God in their fore-heades. And how fitly agréeth this to the Romiſh Locuſtes? For there be in the world two ſorts of people; one, that wittingly and willingly will run after their own woe, and are bitter profeſſed 
                              〈…〉
                           ies of the Truth, whom God in his Juſtice, hath reiected &amp; not ſcaled: yt other ſort, is of them which (not malitiouſly, but of méere ignorance) go awrie, béeing deſirous to doo wel, yet in their ſimplicity deceaued, and abuſed by crafty Juglers. The former ſort onely are thoſe, whom theſe Locuſtes can hurt. The latter (in Gods infinite goodneſſe) is exempt, as greene things which he will not haue harmed, and as perſōs ſealed in their foreheades, which ye former wanted. A ſwéete Teſtimony of the power and mercy of our moſt gratious Father, who in the very middeſt of darkneſſe, &amp; euen when Antichriſt is at his height can preſerue his choſen from any hurt by thoſe ſwarmes of Locuſtes, which haue great power giuen them to hurt others. The obſeruing whereof much doth inable vs to anſwere that ſcale obiection, Where was your Church before Luther. Surely in the middeſt of theſe Locuſtes, Scorpions and Hornets, yet by the power of an Almighty God preſerued from hurt, as you ſée heere, theſe greene things were. But you may thinke, how can this be? Are all thoſe whom theſe Romiſh Locuſtes ſting with any falſe and erronious

opinion, caſt away and damned? this were hard; and if not, how then is it ſaid, that they ſhall not haue power to hurt the Elect? The next verſe in the Reuelation anſwereth the matter: where (leſt any ſhould miſtake the word Apoc 9. 5. of hurting,) the holy Ghoſt ſheweth what hee meaneth by it; namely, that they ſhould not kill the Elect, but onely ſuch as were not ſealed. Hurt then the Elect may be, or (as it is there) vexed fiue moneths, and their paine ſhall be as the paine that commeth of a Scorpion, which hath ſtung a man, but killed they ſhall not be: that is, finally ouer-throwne and caſt away touching eternall life. Graſhoppers come in Aprill, and liue till September; fiue moneths, and then are gone: ſo may the Elect be afflicted for a time, and hurt in their goods, and bodies, &amp; friends, as Iob was, but September will come, when the Locuſts ſhall away, and their Deliuerance be wrought by a gracious GOD. Thus comforted Paule the Church in his time, ſaying, As Iannes and Iambres withſtoode Moſes, ſo doo theſe alſo reſiſt the truth. But (now marke) they ſhall preuaile no 
                           
                              
                                 •
                              . Tim. 3. 8. 
                           longer: for their madnes ſhall be euident vnto all men as theirs alſo was. An end therefore will be of all troubles, which theſe Locuſts ſhall worke vnto the Church and Elect of God. Fiue moneths is not long (in reſpect of that eternitie which followeth;) and therefore in comfort be wee patient: their time is ſet, and they ſhall haue an end. Againe, this place may notably aſſure you, and euery one, that all which died in the time of Poperie, were not caſtaway, but that at one time, or other, by one way, or other, the Lord gaue them light, &amp; a holy departure in his truth: and Stories tell vs how ſtill (in the time of darknes) God raiſed vp ſome zealous, and able Teachers of their brethren, by whoſe miniſterie and helpe many receaued light, and ouercame the power of error. Whereunto agrée the words of Primatius, Illi hic intelliguntur, qui, licet falſis fuerunt irretiti doctrinis, circa finem tamen vitae compuncti, diuinam recipiunt veritatem. They heere are vnderſtoode,

who, though they haue beene abuſed by falſe Doctrine, yet in the end of their life hauing remorſe, they entertained the Heauenly truth. The words following, (that, in thoſe dayes men ſhall ſeeke death, and ſhall not finde it, 
                           Apoc 9. 6. 
                           and ſhall deſire to die, and death ſhall flie from them,) verie effectually ſhew forth the tortures of conſcience, which Popiſh Doctrine caſteth men into, ſo well knowne by fearefull Examples, as I néede not to ſtand vpon it. Alſo the miſteries of the Time wherein the Locuſts ſhould ſwarme, fully expreſſed in Stories, which indéede made many a man and woman wearie of life. The little ſhort time of Quéene Marie her Reigne, how full it was of vexation, and griefe, is not, nor cannot be forgotten.
                        Thirdly, in the place of the Reuelation it is ſaide, The 
                           Apoc. 9 7. 
                           forme of the Locuſts was like vnto horſes prepared vnto battell. And ſée how it reſembleth Romiſh Locuſts. Horſes are proud, ſo are they; Horſes are bolde, and ſturdie, fierce, and cruell, not turning backe, but ruſhing forward; ſo are they bold, and bloodie, ſturdie, and mercileſſe, not looking backe by repentance, but ruſhing forward in hardnes of heart. Horſes are fat, and faire, and full of neighing; ſo are they. And for being prepared to battell, all Hiſtories ſhew, what warres they haue cauſed, and ſtill doo, in the world; themſelues being Leaders, Captaines, and Generals in them: whereas wee knowe, that the true Church of God (by the Rule and Example of the Goſpell) ought to be a Daughter of peace, not a Mother of debate; A forgiuer of iniuries, not a renenger of her ſelfe, or a ſéeker of warres. The Tragicall Storie betwixt Frederick the 2, and Gregorie the 9, may ſerue (in ſteade of many) to prooue, what warres and treacheries come from Rome. That horrible ſlaughter betwixt both ſides of thirtie thouſand Math. Paris. pag. 92. (the moſt Citizens of Rome) whom will it not moue, that readeth it? This Pope was in the daies of Henry the 3, King of England. The open warres proclaimed againſt the Gréeke Church, ſhewe much. But I will lay downe

the very words of Pandolphus, who wrote, in Italian, the life of this Frederick the 2, that ſuch as haue not the Storie, may ſée this point fully; and, I pray you, marke them well. Truly, ſaith He, when I conſider with my ſelfe, that Chriſt (whoſe Vicar the Romaine Biſhops boaſt themſelues 
                           Pandolphus his words. 
                           to be) ſaid vnto his Diſciples, that they ſhould follow him, and imitate his Example, as of their Maiſter and Teacher; and commaunded them farther, that they ſhould not draw the ſword, but put the ſame into the ſcabbard; and gaue them in precept, that they ſhould not onely forgiue iniuries 7. times, but 70. times 7. times, to thoſe that offended them: And, when I now compare the liues of the Biſhops of Rome, how neere they follow him, whoſe Vicars (they ſay) they are; and conſider ſo many, and ſo great conſpiracies, treaſons, rebellions, diſloyalties, lyings in waite, and treacherous deuiſes; ſo many Legates of the Popes, (being Eccleſiaſticall perſons, which will needes be called the Sheepheards of Chriſt his Flocke) to be ſuch Warriours and Captaines of Souldiers in all the parts of Italy, Campania, Apulia, Calabria, (being the Emperours Dominions,) in Picenum, Aemilia, Flaminia, and Lumbardie, to be ſent againſt him; Alſo, when with my ſelfe I meditate the deſtruction of ſo many great and famous Cities, the ſubuerſion of ſuch Cōmon-weales, the ſlaughter of ſo many men, and the effuſion of ſuch Chriſtian blood; Laſtly, when I behold ſo victorious, proſperous, and fortunate Emperours to be, and ſo many miſerable, infortunate, &amp; vanquiſhed Popes to be put to flight; I am perſwaded with my ſelfe to thinke and beleeue, that the Iudgements of God are ſecret, and marueilous, and That to be true that Aeneas Siluius writeth in his Hiſtorie of Austria; That there is no great and marueilous clade, no notorious and ſpeciall calamitie (that hath hapned either to the Publique-weale, or elſe to the Church of GOD) whereof the Biſhops of Rome haue not beene the Authors. Add vnto this that Notable place in the Prophet

                           Micah, where ſpeaking of Gods true Church, it is ſaide, they ſhall breake their ſwords into Mattocks, and their 
                           Micah. 4. 3. 
                           ſpeares into 
                                 •
                              ithes, that is, their fierce affections ſhall (by the power of the word) be mortified, and brotherly loue encreaſed, with deſire of peace and quietnes. But theſe men (euen contrarie) breake their Mattocks into ſwords, and their 
                                 •
                              ithes into ſpeares, being ſo great, ſo fierce, ſo ambitions, and common Warriours, as they are. The ſtrange cruelties of Vrban the 5. making bloodie, &amp; great warres vpon many, and bringing them, by force, in ſubiection to him, I omit. Theſe things ſhew, how truly this Prophecie of the Apocalyps, (concerning Locuſts like vnto horſes prepared to battell) agréeth to theſe Romiſh Locuſts, Popes, Cardinals, Legats, Monkes, Fryers, Prieſts, Ieſuites, and ſuch like. Nicholas Machiauel ſaith, all the ruinous calamities and miſerable clades, that either Italy, or whole Chriſtendome hath ſuffered, haue béene brought in by the Popes of Rome. A faire warning to all Gods people, to know them, and auoide them.
                        Fourthly, on their heads (were as it were) crownes like 
                           Apoc. 9. 7. 
                           vnto gold, And theſe haue Shauen Crownes tokens (as they ſay) of their Prieſtly and Kingly dignity. Such Crownes are rightly ſaid by S. Iohn to be like Crownes, not Crownes indeede. Surely, right Notes they are of Romiſh Locuſts, and that may ſuffice as many as will be warned by any thing.
                        Fiftly, And their faces were like the faces of men. So Apoc. 9. 7. are theſe; not terrible in ſhew, but curteous, kinde, fawning, flattering, watching, catching with ſmooth wiles to effect their purpoſe. They pretend all good, making men beléeue, that they can bring them to true Bleſſednes, that they will teach them true Religion, true Deuotion, and giue them Pardon for all ſinnes. So in Daniel is it ſaide, that to Antichriſt are giuen the eyes of a man, ſtill therefore Daniel. 7. 8. marke how theſe properties hit.
                        Sixtly, Their haire as the haire of women. So are Apoc. 9. 8.
                           
theſe; they are delicious, and wanton, full of light allurements, ſo trick and trim in ſilke and ſutes of their faſhion, that the very Perſians may ſéeme to giue place vnto them, when they are in their Pontificalibus, and gay attire. In a word, nothing may be ſaide more truly than that their 
                           See Aug in Apoc. 
                           haire is like the haire of women. Their looſe life hath to
                              •
                            much proofe.
                        Seauenthly, But their teeth were as the teeth of Lyons. 
                           Apoc. 9. 8. So are theſe; paſſing cruell, and beyond all the butchering Tyrants that Stories ſpeake of. No mercie, no bowels, no reſpect of age, ſe
                              •
                           e, or circumſtance, vſually reſpected of men that haue any remnants of pitie. Their Inquiſition, (Oh how mercileſſe? their new deuiſed Torments, (Oh) how ſtrange? Againe, their teeth may bee well ſaid to be like Lyons, becauſe they deuoured, and eate vp ſuch great things. Looke vpon their Abbies, Priories, Nunries, and all Religious Houſes; iudge what teeth they had, and when there was not enough to ſatiſfie them (of temporall Lands,) then they preyed vpon the Church, making Impropriations, the venome whereof remaineth yet. So that one way, or other, they were planted &amp; placed, ſeated and ſetled in the very fat of the earth: and had they continued ſtill, and not béene limited to fiue moneths, who? or what ſhould haue eſcaped their Lyon-like teeth?
                        
                        Eightly, They had Habbergions, like to Habbergions of yron. And 
                              •
                           o haue theſe, if you well marke them: for, Apoc 9. 9. 
                           by theſe yron Breſt-plates are noted two properties, found in the Romiſh rabble. Firſt, a moſt obſtinate ſtubbornneſſe and inflexible frowardneſſe, not enduring any perſwaſion, not yéelding any way, but crying euer, The Church, The Church, I am ſetled, I am reſolued, and, as a Captaine of theirs (an Engliſh Apoſtata) ſaide once; Heaue at vs whileſt you will, and whileſt you may, you ſhall neuer remoue vs. This is to haue an Habbergion, or Breſt-plate of yron, or, euen to bee turned into yron.

Bleſſed be God, who hath thus foretolde vs of this ſtriffe con
                              •
                           umacie of theirs, to the end we ſhould take no offence, that they are not conuerted vnto the Truth, but ſtand, and die in their wilfulnes. Secondly, they are defended by that Antichriſtian power, as it were, by an Habbergion of yron, claiming an impunitie, &amp; immunitie from all ſecular power and authoritie, and hauing (in readines) curſes and threats of Excommunication, euen againſt the Greateſt Princes, and againſt All their Subiects, who ſhall obey them; whereof many a wofull Tragedie hath followed. Againe, themſelues (many of them) haue béene Princes younger Sonnes, Noble-mens younger ſonnes, greatly allied and friended, ſo that (in regard of this power and ſtrength) they might truly be ſaide to haue Habbergions of yron.
                        
                        Ninthly, The ſound of their wings was like the ſound of Chariots when many horſes runne vnto battell. So Apoc. 9. 9. haue theſe winges, when they flie aloft by the Names of MOST HOLY FATHERS, MOST BLESSED, MOST EXCELLENT, and ſuch like; themſelues giuing out, That they are more bleſſed, than the holy virgin Mary, becauſe ſhe bare Chriſt but once, and they make him, and beare him in their hands euery day at the Altar. Thus flying with their light wings of proud Titles, they make ſuch a noiſe and ſound as Chariots drawne by many horſes into the battell. For, denie any of theſe things, and how violent, how vehement are they, by Diſputations, Excommunications, Suſpentions, and Sentences of death it ſelfe? Surely, no whéeles of Chariots can flaſh out fire ſo, as theſe men doo, if their flickering wings of flattering Titles be touched. Fitly therefore the words of S. Iohn hit them. Their Scorpion tailes and power to hurt was touched Apoc. 9. 10. before, therefore I omit it now.
                        The tenth Marke is, Thoſe Locuſts haue a King ouer them. And ſo haue theſe Romiſh Locuſts their Pope, acknowledging no Magiſtrates authoritie ouer them, but

exalting him, and exempting themſelues from all others. This King of the Locuſtes is héere called The Angel of the bottomleſſe pit; and in the eleuenth Chapter, The 
                           Adoc. 11. 7. 
                           Beaſt that commeth out of the bottomleſſe pit. Wordes of weight, to mooue all Popiſh mindes, if the Lord had not a purpoſe to deſtroy them. For they muſt néedes acknowledge, ſuch a King is not worth the following; and, that their Pope is this King, that which hath béene ſaid, and may further be noted, of him, clearely ſheweth. For hee that croſſeth and cruſheth (to his vttermoſt power) His Doctrine that came from Heauen, he is the King that commeth out of Hell, in whom S. Hierome ſaith, the Deuill dwelleth bodily. But the Pope doth ſo, as proofe enough will manifeſt, and Ergo the concluſion followeth as I ſaid. His Name alſo is folde héere, which giueth againe great light. For albeit the Pope be called Holy Father, and ſo forth; yet indéede he is a bloodie Deſtroyer, and ſo his right Name in 
                           Dan. 7. 6. 11. Zach. 11. Apoc. 9. 11. 
                           Hebrewe, is Abaddon,
                            and in Greeke, Apollyon, that is, deſtroying. Thus in the Prophecie of the Reuelation hath God, you ſée, deſcribed a fearefull kinde of Locuſtes, vnto the conſideration whereof, by reaſon of theſe Egyptian Locuſts or Graſhoppers we haue ſlipped, I hope, not without ſome encreaſe of féeling, how dreadfull their ſteps be, that continually walke in Romiſh wayes, and will not be reclaimed by any meanes. Our owne ſafer iudgement God make vs thankfull for, and continue the bleſſed helpes of our confirmation in his Truth, euer vnto vs, his holy and Heauenly Word, a fréedome to vſe all the profitable exerciſes thereof, (as Preaching, hearing, reading, writing, praying, conference, and whatſoeuer elſe) without feare, vnder the ſwéete ſmelling gouernment of a gracious Prince, our dread Souereigne. Amen, Amen.
                        
                        10. Therefore Pharaoh called for Moſes and Aaron in

                           haſt, and ſaide, I haue ſinned againſt the Lord your God, and againſt you. And now forgiue me my ſinne onely this once, and pray vnto the Lord your God, that he may

But this hypocriticall holineſſe of this diſſembling King we haue diuers times noted before, and therefore may paſſe it ouer now. Yet marke the great vehemency of his wordes, and conſider in your minde, what a déep ſin Hypocriſy is, how diſagréeing from the nature of God, who is all Truth and from that bleſſing in the Goſpell, of a pure heart.

                           Matth. 5. 8. Ver. 18. &amp; 19. yéelded againe to pray to God; And, by a mightie ſtrong Weſt-winde the Graſhoppers were taken away, and violently caſt into the Red-Sea, ſo that there remained not ſo-much as one in all the coaſt of Egypt. But when it was done, Ph

                        The 9. plague.
                        1. VVHere vpon the Lord ſpake againe to Moſes and ſaid, Stretch out thine hand toward heauen, that there may be vpon the land of Egypt darknes, euen darkeneſſe that may bee felt. Then Moſes ſtretched-forth his hand toward heauen, and there was a blacke darkneſſe in the land of Egypt 3. dayes, no man ſaw an other, neither roſe vp from the place where he was, for 3. daies. The manner of this darknes is deſcribed, firſt in theſe wordes, euen that may bee felt; whereby either litterally a very vile groſſe matter is meant (which indéede might be felt) or at leaſt ſo thicke foggie and filthy, as was moſt noiſome, &amp; might be ſaide (as it were) palpable. Secondly, ſuch it was as no man ſawe an other, neither role-up from the place where he was, which flit be taken Philo in vita Moſis, Aug. in Exod. 
                           litterallie (as is ſaid) was a moſt ſtrange and fearefull thing▪ and, if figuratiuely, that it diſabled them to go to worke abroad, (according to the Pſalme, The ſunne ariſeth,

and man goeth forth to his laboure) euen that way alſo it was a great plaguè. Thirdly, the time is noted, for the ſpace of three dayes; a great while to be in ſuch a caſe, as (were wée but one houre in) it would make the ſtrongeſt natural man ſhake and be amazed. Fourthly, in the booke of Wiſedome it is deſcribed by much feare in theſe wordes. When the vnrighteous thought to haue thy holy people in ſubiection, they were bound with the 
                           Wiſed. 17. 2. 
                           bands of darknes and long night: and being ſhut vp vnder the roofe did lye there to eſcape the euerlaſting Prouidence. And while they thought to be hid in their darke 
                           3. 
                           ſinnes they were ſcattered abroad in the darke couering of forgetfulneſſe; fearing horribly and troubled with viſions. For the den that hid them kept them not from feare: but the ſounds that were about them troubled them, and 
                           4. 
                           terrible viſions and ſorrowfull ſights did appeare. No power 
                           5. 
                           of the fire might giue light, neither might the cleare flames of the ſtarres lighten the horrible night. According whereunto is that in Philo written, Ignem domesticum, quo quotidié vtimur, vel extinctum fuiſſe turbato aere, vel craſſiſſimis tenebris victum, vt nullum lumen caligo illa admitteret. That fire and candell was either quite extinguiſhed, or ſo ouercome with the troubled ayre, that no light could be admitted in that darknes.
                            This then was the fearefull &amp; moſt fearefull maner of yt darknes; which maketh me remē
                           ber that great darknes, which is ſaid to haue béen in Hiſpaniola, when Columbus came thither the ſecond time, about the yéere of Chriſt 1493: And that which Tullie writeth of to haue béene in Cicilie, vt per biduum homo hominem non agnoſceret; that by the ſpace of two daies one man could not knowe another. All ſhould make vs with thankfull hearts acknowledge the Mercie of God in this one benefit of Light (amongſt infinite moe) that we enioy, and humbling our ſoules vnder him, as the Lord of Light and darknes, Life and Death, Hell and Heauen, ſerue him in reuerence and feare according to his Wil all the daies of our

life. S. Auguſtine and others goe farther in the Meditation of this darknes of Egypt, and ſay, that it was a ſigne of the darknes of their mindes then, and a plaine ſhadowe of their wofull Night of ignorance and blindnes, that is ouer ſome men in all times, and admitteth no light. For the Egyptians, it is manifeſt, that extreame was the fogge in their hearts, when ſuch Wonders wrought no more. Such déepe ſecuritie before puniſhment, ſuch inflexible obſtinacie, in, and vnder puniſhment, ſuch high pride after puniſhment, and ſuch a monſtrous diſſembling of repentance euer, (which both deceaueth the beholders, and hurteth the vſers, as One well ſaith) argued darknes of minde, thicke and blacke, vehemently to be prayed againſt by all that wiſh to haue ſaued ſoules in that Great day of God. And for vs in theſe times, and ſo euer to the worldes end, wee are all to conſider, that our Ignorance is darknes in déede, and that very great darknes, ſo termed by God himſelfe, more dangerous than this of Egypt, in that the Soule is héereby deſtroyed, and by that onely the body was annoyed. Whereupon, by this horror in Egypt, wee may take occaſion to conſider of our ſelues, and by that (darknes noted to be ſuch a plague,) to thinke, whether our darknes be a vertue? The Light of the body is the Eye (ſaith our Math. 6. 22. 23 Luke. 11. 34. Sauiour Chriſt:) If then the Eye be ſingle, thy whole bodie ſhall be light. But if thine Eye be wicked (or euill) then all thy body ſhall be darke. Wherefore, if the light that is in thee be darknes, how great is that darknes? Now, as the Eye is to the body, ſo is the Judgement of the minde to the whole life; and therefore darknes in iudgement, moſt dangerous. S. Paule in like ſort noteth Ignorance by the name and fruite of darknes, when he ſaith of the Gentiles to the Epheſians, that their vnderſtanding was darkned, and 
                           Epheſ. 4. 18. 
                           they ſtrangers from the life of God, through the ignorance that was in them. And of the Epheſians themſelues, Yee were once darknes, but now are yee light in the Lord; 
                           Ephe. 5. 8. 
                           walke as the children of light. Many other places in the

Scripture ſay the like, terming ſtill and euer Ignorance to be darknes, and noting an inward darknes in man, of his minde, as well as an outward, of his eye. Which may make vs thinke, why God ſhould ſo ſpeake? and by conſideration thereof (hee euer ſpeaking moſt fitly) draw vs to the obſeruance of certaine properties, wherein there is agréement betwixt inward and outward darknes. Firſt, outward darknes hindereth our eyes from diſcerning the outward obiects, which by them ſhould bee diſcerned, and therefore haue their name tenebrae, á tenendo, becauſe they hold the eye from doing his dutie; ſo doth Ignorance (our inward darknes) hold and hinder our iudgement (which, as an eye, ſhould guide our actions) frō diſcerning things fit to be done, and fit to be left vndone; whereby, as blinde men, wee fall into many ditches, that is, wee commit and omit, doo and leaue vndone many things contrarie to our duties, both to God and man.
                        Secondly, outward darknes hindereth our going and walking about our worke, or for our health and comfort. For he that walketh in darknes, cannot tell whither he goeth, 
                           Iohn. 12. 35. ſaith Chriſt; and it is true in this ſenſe: ſo Ignorance (the inward darknes) hindereth our iudgements, our harts and mindes from going and walking through the ſwéete fields of true Comforts, true knowledge, and Heauenly Meditations; for in this ſenſe alſo our Sauiours wordes are true; A blinde man (thus) knoweth not whither he goeth. A darke iudgement and a blinde heart knoweth not, féeleth not, taſteth not the pleaſant pathes of knowledge either in matters Humane, or Diuine. Miſerable therefore is this darknes, and a wofull effect of our fall in Adam, to be prayed againſt, and laboured againſt, as much as we poſſibly can, although (whileſt we liue) we ſhall groane vnder part of it, knowing but in part, &amp; ſeeing but in part, in this life, as the Apoſtle teacheth vs. 2. Cor. 12. 9.
                        
                        Thirdly, outward darknes maketh men fall, and that often with great hurt, euen vnto death: ſo doth inward

darknes of the minde make men fall with ſo much perill, by how much the fall of ſoule is worſe than the fall of body, and death eternall worſe than temporall. Let their way be darke and ſlipperie, ſaith Dauid in the Pſalme, as a meanes (both the one way, and the other) to bring men to confuſion.
                        Fourthly, outward darknes worketh in ſome horror and feare, (wee knew it by experience:) euen ſo doth in-ward darknes, if you obſerue either Scripture, or experience. Scripture, when it is ſaid, They ſhall feare, where no feare is (meaning by the darknes and ignorance of iudgement:) Experience in Caine, who (through ignorance) cried with horror and feare, My ſinne is greater, than can be forgiuen; and in many deare children of God, who quake and quiuer vnder the taſte and touch of ſinne, not yet able to reach by the light of minde (becauſe God will exerciſe them) to the ſwéetnes, and riches of Gods mercie, reuealed in his promiſes. Examples are many, but a ſecret meditation in your ſelfe of what you knowe, may beſt ſerue.
                        Fiftly, &amp; laſtly, outward darknes in ſome others (cleane contrarie) worketh boldnes and ſecuritie, and is the deadly bane of modeſtie and honeſtie. As, when the man that breaketh 
                           Sirach. 23. 1
                                 •
                              . 
                           Wedlocke thinketh thus in his heart, Who ſeeth me? I am compaſſed about with darknes, the walles couer me, no body ſeeth me; whō neede I to feare? the moſt HIGH will not remember my ſinnes, &amp;c. So doth inward darknes of Judgement and hart (in ſome men) make boldnes aboue meaſure to aſke, to ſpeake, to defend and publiſh what were better paſſed ouer and buried with peace of Church and Common-wealth. They ſée not in darknes what they doo, but pleaſing themſelues in a miſſe-conceipt for want of true iudgement build vp the Tower of Babell very violently, to their great ſhame and reproofe, both with God and man. Fitly then you ſée (in regard of theſe properties, and many others) is Ignorance called darknes

by the holy Ghoſt, and thereby wee admoniſhed to pray and labour againſt it, as a plague of God not vnlike to this of Egypt. Which iuſtly may occaſion your next Meditation to be, How it groweth? that wee may the better

                              ••
                            and preuent it. This will likewiſe appeare by conſidering the cauſes of outward darknes, and ſéeing whether there be not the like of inward darknes. Firſt then, outward darknes (or blindnes of the body) groweth in ſome by birth, as the blinde man in Iohn healed by our Sauiour Chriſt, and many daily experiences before our eyes: euen ſo doth inward darknes growe in vs all from our birth by the fall of Adam, that moſt excellent light and knowledge (wherein hee was created) being loſt by him both to himſelfe, and all his poſteritie, vntill the Lord renue vs in knowledge after his image, as he created vs at firſt according to the ſame by knowledge. Coloſ. 3. 10.
                        
                        Secondly, outward darknes groweth ſometimes by too-much gazing vpon bright and gliſtering things, as (in experience) we ſinde by white ſnow, white paper, and the like: ſo doth inward darknes grow alſo by fixing the minde too-much vpon the gliſtering glory of this World, the pompes and pleaſures that ſhine in it. Proofe héere of that rich Glutton, that rich Barne-builder in the Goſpell, and that Turne-coate Demas of whom S. Paule ſpeaketh, who all were blinde, you plainly ſée, with gazing too-much vpon this tempting World. And how many amongſt vs, men and women, be in this ſort blinde, he knoweth, who ſhall iudge both quicke and dead, and who cannot be deceaued by any colours. Good it is therefore to take héede betime, and to turne away the eye from ſo hurtfull an obiect, duly and truly conſidering the nature of it. It is tranſitorie and abideth not, it is vaine and vile, pleaſe it neuer ſo much; So haue all found it that haue gone before vs, ſo ſhall wee finde it, and all that euer ſhall followe after vs. A Mappe of the world hath Kingdomes and Countries very beautifully ſet out in it, Cities, Churches, and Towers

deſcribed liuely in variable colours; yet all is but Paper, &amp; one drop of water will deface the greateſt Princes Pallace in it: So is this World (which men loue ſo much) in déede very Paper, that is, very vaine and fickle: And that heart which hath furniſhed it ſelfe with all theſe Caſtles and Towers (through a wicked loue and longing for them,) one Fit of an Ague wil ſhake and ſhiuer in ſuch ſort, as no pleaſure ſhall remaine of all theſe things. In the meane time, Religion there is none where this loue is, neither any fellowſhip with the Almightie. For as hote Sommer-weather maketh our inward heate leſſe (by ſuffering it to euaporate,) than Winters-colde doth, which kéepeth it in; ſo doth this World fawning vpon vs, and the loue of it liuing in vs, eate out all zeale and pietie, leauing vs colder within than aduerſitie and the want of the world doth. And, Loue God and the world to, we cannot, 
                           1. Iohn. 2. 15. ſaith S. Iohn. Dauid, clogged with Saule his Armour, ſaid, he could not goe; and therefore put it all off againe: Euen ſo aſſuredly can no man march towards Heauen, if his heart be buckled and faſtned to this World, till he lay aſide that hinderance from him. That Spéech of S. Cyprian ſhould much be marked in this point, Arridet mundus, vt ſaeuiat; blanditur vt fallat; allicit vt occidat; extollit vt deprimat. Vna haecplacida, ſolida, firma, &amp; perpetua ſecuritas, ſi quicquid in rebus humanis ſublime &amp; magnum videtur occulis ad coelum elatis infra conſcientiam tuam iacere, poſſis gloriari. This curſed world fawneth, that it may bee cruell; flattereth that it may decaue; allureth that it may kill; and lifteth vp, that it may throw downe. Wherefore this onely is ſweete, ſound, firme, and during ſecuritie, if thou canſt truly auowe, that whatſoeuer ſeemeth great and glorious in this world, with thine eyes lifted vp to Heauen thou haſt caſt and throwne vnder thy heart;
                            ſo that it ſhall not preſſe downe thée, but thou wilt tread vppon it in a Religious contempt thereof, by compariſon with Heauen and Heauenly ioyes. S. Auguſtine his

Spéech alſo is worthy remembring; Vnicui
                                 
                                    
                                 
                                 que
                               tempestas est ſuacupiditas. Amas Deum? ambulas ſuper mare. Amas ſeculum? abſorbebitte. Amatores ſuos vorarenouit, petare non nouit. Euery mans luſt (or vehement deſire) is as a tempeſt to him
                            (like vnto that in the Goſpell, whereof Peter being afraide, began to ſinke.) Loueſt thou GOD? then thou walkeſt vpon the Sea, Loueſt thou the world then thou ſinkeſt, and this Sea will ſwallow thee vp. The world knoweth how to deuoure her Louers, but not how to refreſh them and doo them good. I might goe farther in this cauſe of darknes (if it were néedefull,) but this ſufficeth, to ſhew you the way how to meditate further on it.
                        A Third way whereby outward blindnes groweth is by long being in darknes, as in priſon or elſe where: for (by experience) it is ſo found often. Euen ſo, by long cuſtome of walking &amp; liuing in the outward workes of darknes, groweth a ſtrong and thicke inward darknes in the heart of man and woman. Proofe héereof Ahab, Manaſſes, Herod, Iudas, and ſuch like, too many alſo (in our daies) who hauing long vſed Swearing, Lying, Uncleanenes, &amp;c, are growne ſo blinde in them, that they neither will leaue them, neither be perſwaded they tend ſo to their deſtruction as they doo. Theſe blinde creatures ſhrinke to heare of this Egyptian darknes: and yet their owne, tenne thouſand times worſe, they neuer ſhake at. Let it make vs remember the words of wiſe Sirach, A man that is accuſtomed 
                           Sirach. 23. 15. 
                           to opprobrious words, will neuer be reformed all the daies of his life. Why? becauſe Cuſtome of ſinning taketh away the ſenſe of ſinning, and long aboade in darknes maketh ſtarke blinde. Accuſtome not thy mouth therefore, ſaith he, to ſwearing, neither take vp for a Cuſtome the naming of the Holy one. Where ſtill marke the word Cuſtome, Cuſtome, and ſée what a ſtrong deſtroyer it is of the ſight (the inward ſight &amp; light I meane, of our hearts and mindes.)
                        Fourthly, ouermuch heate may hurt the bodily eyes; as, we all know, the hotedung did Toby his eyes: Euen ſo

ouer hote deſires of gaine hurteth the inward light, as we knowe, both by that which hath béene ſaide touching the world, and by that which S. Paule ſaith, that they which 
                           1. Tim. 6. 9. 
                           will be rich fall into temptations and ſnares, and into manie fooliſh and noyſome luſts, which drowne men in perdition and deſtruction. For the deſire of money is the roote of all euill, which (while ſome luſted after) they erred from the Faith, and pearced themſelues through with many ſorrowes. They that will be rich, I ſay againe, &amp; (I pray you) mark the Apoſtles words, yt is, they which haue reſolued with themſelues, ſet their hearts vpon it and concluded it, that by hab or nab, by one way or other, whatſoeuer 
                           Vijs &amp; modis. 
                           it coſt them, they will be rich and haue the wealth they poſſiblie can attaine to. Theſe, theſe men with this Will, (this reſolued and ſetled Will) fall into temptations, and ſo forth. For this is a kinde of peſtilent heate within, which as powerfully thruſteth out the inward eye &amp; light of the minde, as euer any outward heate did the eye of the body. And then, the inward eye being out, nothing but darknes is there, &amp; ſo a falling into all dangerous Courſes that may leade to deſtruction and perdition. Then vſurie is no ſinne; no, not vſurie vpon vſurie; oppreſſion and deceite be no ſinnes, ſtealth and robberie (if it may be any way coloured) is wiſedome, and well; yea, murther and blood bite not. But is the Lord of Heauen pleaſed with this ſinfull Will to be rich, and with theſe exorbitant wayes? or, is this heate a pleaſing heate vnto him, becauſe hee is ſlowe to wrath and vengeance? no, no, and that ſhall the end declare both vpon the wealth, and the houſe, that this dealing is in appointed time. In the meane while we are taught by this place to Timothy, to beware of ſuch a Will, and of ſuch an inward heate as cauſeth ſuch inward blindnes. Soone enough, if well enough, ſay we euer; and for theſe tranſitorie things, as wee brought them not into the world, ſo ſhall we not carie them out of the world. Balaam, Geheſi, Iudas, and ſuch like, preach vnto vs to beware

                           of goods euill gotten. A darknes then you ſée there is within, as well as without; and the more dangerous farre is the inward, becauſe it hideth from vs things of greater conſequence than doth the outward. Not to ſée credenda, agenda, &amp; cauenda, things to be beleeued, things to be performed, and things to be auoyded,
                            is a horrible darknes. Caine ſawe not the firſt, and Salomons fooliſh young-man, led as an Oxe to the ſlaughter, and as a foole 
                           Pro 7 7 22. 
                           to the ſtockes, ſawe neither the ſecond, nor the third. Wherefore the Lord (in great mercie) hath euer béene carefull to furniſh vs with meanes and helpes againſt it. Firſt, he created vs (as hath béene ſhewed) with light and knowledge moſt excellent; he prouided a great Booke (euen the Booke of the World, created by him) wherein the inuiſible things of him, that is, his eternall power &amp; God-head 
                           Rom. 1. 20. 
                           might be ſeene, &amp; much excellent knowledge might be had; And this Booke remaineth ſtill, if wee will reade in it, an enemie to darknes. Of which Booke Clemens Alexandrinus ſpake, when he ſaid, Creatio mundi Scriptura 
                           Strom. 6. 
                           Dei; The Creation of the world is Gods Writing.

Neuertheleſſe, the Lord hath not héere left vs; but as vnto the Starre manifeſting the birth of his

beſides the Booke of the Creation giuen vs another (more excellent by much) to driue from our hearts this damnable darknes, and to kéepe vs in light, pleaſing to himſelfe, and profitable vnto vs. Of this Booke, farre better wee may vſe Damihi Magistrum, giue me the Maiſter,

For this Booke paſſeth All Bookes that euer were or ſhall be, (I meane, the Booke of Gods holy Bible: which Booke, ſaith Hierome, ſhall remaine with vs till wee be as the Angels in Heauen. Goe we forward, and conſider how alſo to this Booke he hath added Prophets, Apoſtles, Euangeliſts, Paſtors, and Doctors in all times, to open and expound the Eph. 4. 11 ſame vnto vs, that by all meanes wee might be enducd with light, loue light, liue in light, and die in light. Add againe the appointing of the Sabaoth day, wherein men Iohn. 5. 39. Luke 16. 16. 29. 32. Deut. 6. 6. 7. 1. Cor. 14. 20. ſhonld reſt from their labours, and hearken to this Booke together with the many precepts giuen to heare, to reade, to ſearch, to know, and vnderſtand, &amp; not to be as children, perceauing nothing. Thinke with your ſelfe often, how the little Infant groweth to ſtrength, able to go by it ſelfe: is it not by ſucking and plucking his Mothers breaſts? euen ſo doth the Childe of God grow to ſtrength of grace, and from grace to grace, by hanging continually vpon theſe two Breaſts, the olde and new Teſtament. And as all men differ from brute Beaſts by reaſon, &amp; knowledge: ſo differeth one man from another, by more &amp; more knowledge in this Booke. Woe to thoſe Teachers then, that lull vs a ſléepe, and tell vs that Ignorance is the Mother of Deuotion, that giue vs not leaue, either to reade, or pray, or doo any duty, in a tongue that we know, but like thoſe curſed Scribes and Phariſes, thoſe hypocrites, ſhut vp

Let this now ſpoken, make vs ſée their fault, and that miſerie ſo to liue: as alſo this moſt ſwéet bleſſing of knowledge now vouchſafed to vs, by ye mercie of God through

the happy gouernment of his Annointed ſeruant, our déere and dread Souereigne: and ſending vp to God our thankfull thoughts both for it, and him, and begging the continuance of both long and long vnto vs.

                           of Iſrael had light where they dwelt. Which ſurely was a very admirable thing, the houſes of Egyptians and Iſraelites ioyning (as it ſhould ſéeme) one cloſe to another, as ours, in theſe daies, doo. For elſe why ſhould the blood be ſtriked vpon the doore poſts of the Iſraelites, for a ſigne to the deſtroying Angell, where to kill, and where to paſſe ouer, if all the Iſraelites had dwelt by themſelues, and had not béene mingled with the Egyptians? This minde was Gregory Nyſſen of, and therefore hee ſaith, Nontantum in Goſen, vbi cōmuniter morabantur, ſed cum inter Aegyptios promiſcue etiam habitarent; &amp; in hoc, maximum miraculum. Not onely in Goſen, where onely Iſraelites (for the moſt part) dwelled, but among the Egyptians being mingled and dwelling together,
                            the Iſraelites had light, and the Egyptian darknes; And heerein was the greateſt miracle. The good wee may take, by this ſtrange worke of GOD, is, firſt to learne, how able our Heauenly Father is to make a ſeparation betwixt his Children and the Wicked, when he executeth wrath and Juſtice, if his good pleaſure be ſo to doo: though they be in one field together, in one houſe together, and in one Matr. 24. 40. 41. bed together; yet can bee chooſe the one, and refuſe the other. Wherefore true is that Saying of the Pſalme, If his wrath be kindled but a little. Bleſſed are all they 
                           Pſal. 2. 12. 
                           that put their truſt in him. Feare wee not then in the time of Plague, of Warre, or other Publique calamitie, leaſt we ſhould periſh with the wicked, hand ouer head: but remember this Place, and ſay in your heart with comfort and faith; O Lord my GOD, and gracious Father, I knowe thine able hand to make a ſeparation (if thou pleaſe) in this calamitie, betwixt thy poore Lambes,

and the Goates, as thon diddeſt in that darknes betwixt the Iſraelites and Egyptians: therefore, I flie vnto thee in humble acknowledgement of my ſinne, and for him that had no ſinne, I begge that (if thy good pleaſure may bee ſo) thou wouldeſt vouchſafe to ſaue mee from this Sword of thine, to let the light of thy mercie and louing countenance ſhine about my dwelling, as thy chéerefull light did about the Iſraelites. So ſhall my ſoule and heart euer praiſe Thee, and thanke Thee. But if otherwiſe, LORD and Father, thy Will bee done, and not mine; onely in the world to come, acknowledge mee, as I doo not doubt but thou wilt, and it ſhall ſuffice.
                        Secondly, let this place be obſerued, as a very plaine Figure of that, which wee ſée amongſt vs euery day. At one houſe dwelt an Egyptian, and it was all darke; at the next an Iſraelite, and it was all light: ſo nowe at one houſe dwelleth a ſuperſtitious Recuſant, or a prophane Atheiſt, and all is darke; At the verie next houſe dwelleth a zealous Profeſſour of the truth, who readeth the Scriptures, heareth them preached, frequenteth the Sacraments, and faithfully laboureth that himſelfe with his whole Familie, may liue according to the Word; and héere is all light, which ſhall leade to the light eternall with God and all his hoſte, when the good houre commeth. God ſtrengthen our hearts euermore in the loue of this light, and make vs truly thankfull for theſe lightſome daies. Amen.

                           The chiefe Heads of this Chapter are theſe three.
                           
                              1. A Denuntiation of a new plague.
                              2. An Admonition to the Iſraelites what to do.
                              3. The Plague it ſelfe.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        1. COncerning the firſt, it is contained ver. 1. (as you ſée) in theſe wordes: Yet will I bring one plague more vpon Pharaoh and Egypt.
                            And to make vſe to our ſelues of it, you that are acquainted (by your priuate reading) with the Courſe of the Scriptures, very well knowe the manner of Gods dealing in this matter, from the beginning to the end. Firſt, how milde it was, then how (by

degrées it encreaſed to ſharper and ſharper, till the deliuerance of his Church and people were effected. At the firſt, he appointed Moſes and Aaron with the Elders of Iſrael, to goe to Pharaoh, and to entreate him mildly and dutifullie, ſaying. The Lord God of the Hebrewes hath met with 
                           Chap. 5. 3. 
                           vs, WEE PRAY THEE therefore let vs goe three daies iourney into the Wildernes, that we may ſacrifice vnto the Lord our God. But this praying would not ſerue, wherefore the Lord went néerer them, by great and powerfull wonders, yet by degrées touching them, and not with the greateſt at the firſt. He cauſed Moſes rod to be turned to a Serpent, &amp;c. A thing that hurt them not, yet in all reaſon ſhould haue moued them. Then, he turned their waters into blood, which did ſomewhat touch them. After, when that preuailed not, hee annoyed them with filthie Frogges, and ſo ſtill, you knowe, by degrées, vntill he had brought 9. fearefull plagues vpon the Land. But as you alſo know, none of them all would worke the deliuerance of the Church, but ſtill with an hardned heart, as ſoone as any plague was remoued, Pharaoh returned to his diſobedience againſt the Lord. Whereupon at length God came to theſe words: Yet will I bring one plague more: as if hee ſhould haue ſaide, notwithſtanding that all theſe former works can preuaile nothing with Pharaoh, yet let him not thinke that he can be too hard for me; for hee ſhall well finde, that I both can and will be too hard for him, I haue yet one Plague more, which I wil bring vpon him, and that ſhall ſo ſtoope him, that hee ſhall not onely let my people goe, but ſhall be moſt glad of the diſpatch of them. Sée we then in theſe things, for our owne vſe, the Courſe and procéeding which euer (from the beginning) the Lord hath vſed, and euer will vnto the end, as he ſhall ſée occaſion: euen firſt in mercy to entreate, and in mildnes (by more gentle meanes) to allure; then in the end, by power and Judgement to compell, when the former courſe will not ſerue. In the firſt age, when the olde world would

not bee reformed, but more and more prouoked him to wrath, by taking wiues deſcended of wicked Parents, more regarding, in a fleſhly ſenſuality, outward beautie, than inward vertue, the Lord ſaide, His Spirit ſhould no longer ſtriue with man, meaning, with lenitie and gentlenes, as vnto that time it had done, but now hee would bring vpon them his one plague more, as héere vpon Egypt, which ſhould be indéede a ſtooping plague, (as héere this was) and ſhould ſuffice to cruſh crooked diſobedience, and to pull downe haughtie pride, as was méete; That was, the Great flood, which deſtroyed man, woman, and 
                           Gen. 6. 17. 18. 
                           childe, ſauing eight perſons appointed to be ſaued. When Sodome and Gomorrha would not 
                              〈◊〉
                            warned by any way of mercie and patience, vſed by a gracious God vnto them many yéeres, then that one plague more of fire and brimſtone from Heauen came, and ſtooped them, and burnt them to aſhes, as they deſerued. Iezabell had faire Gen. 19. 24. warnings, to amend her life, to loue Religion, to leaue Idolatrie, and to become a better woman both to GOD, and the world, many a yéere before her fall came, (Eliah that worthie Prophet liuing by her, &amp; doing great works to ſhew that God was with him) yet nothing would ſerue. Therefore, at the laſt, came the ſtooping Plague, and ſhee was throwne downe at the windowe, where the Dogges 
                           2. Kings. 9. 33. 
                           did eate her vp all, ſauing the ſcull, feete, and palmes of her hands. A dreadfull example of Gods wrath vpon a 35. ſinner, when milde and mercifull wayes to amend him, will not ſerue. Manaſſes, a King of great vngodlines, (as you ſée in the Storie) at length was brought, by the ſtooping plague of yron-fetters, and bondage, to be humbled, 2. Cron. 33. 12 and repent, as was fit for him. What gracious dealing did God firſt vſe towards Nabuchadnezzar in forwarning him by a Dreame, what ſhould be the end of his wicked life, then to prouide Daniel for him, both to expound the ſame vnto him, and to giue him that good aduiſe ſpecified in the Text, euen to breake off his ſinnes by righteouſnes, 
                           Dan. 4. 24.
                           
                           and his iniquities by mercy towards the poore, and that 
                           Dan. 4. 24. 27. 
                           there might be an healing of his error? yet all would not ſerue: but he went on, and offended God more and more, as you ſée in the 27. verſe. Wherefore, God brought vpon him his ſtooping plague, and draue him from among 
                           29. &amp; 30. 
                           men, to haue his dwelling among the beaſts of the field, to eate graſſe as the Oxen, and to haue his body wet with the dewe of Heauen, till his haire was growne as Eagles feathers, and his nailes like vnto birds clawes. By which one plague more, the Lord, as you knowe, brought him home and humbled him. Let vs come vnto that fearefull example of Hieruſalem,

                           he wofulleſt Storie that euer pen committed to paper. What preaching and teaching had they firſt vouchſafed vnto them? What Prophets and men of God full of grace &amp; power liued among them? yea, euen the Sonne of God himſelfe, Chriſt Ieſus, they had in the fleſh to conuerſe with them, who both by Doctrine and miracles moſt admirable, offered them life and comfort, and laboured to drawe them from their danger; but all would not ſerue, they killed the Prophets, and ſtoned them, which were ſent vnto them, they deſpiſed all, and with bloodie hands, crucified the Lord of life himſelfe, in a moſt high contempt of God, and all his offered grace. What remained therefore, but that the Lord ſhould drawforth his laſt plague, his one plague more, his ſtooping plague as héere he did againſt Pharaoh, and to make ſuch a rebellious people knowe themſelues? So hee did, and ſent againſt them Titus the ſonne of Veſpaſian, with the Romaine power, who beſieged their Citie at ſuch a time, as the greateſt concourſe was there, brought them to famine, and ſuch miſerie, as neuer befell any people in this world but them, and in the end, vtterly ouerthrew them all, their Citie, and glory, and whatſoeuer had exalted it ſelfe againſt God. O miſerie! who can reade it, or ſpeake of it with drie eies? When once they began to iſſue-out, compelled with famine, they were ſtill taken and crucified

vpon croſſes, and gibbets ſet vp before the walles, that they which were within might ſée them, and giue ouer, but yet they would not. Fiue hundred a day were thus hanged vp, till there were neither trées to be gotten, nor any more ſpace left to ſet them in. Amongſt whom, no doubt, were the children of thoſe that cried againſt our Sauiour, Crucifie him, crucifie him, his blood be vpon 
                           Luke 23 21. Math. 27. 25. 
                           vs, and vpon our children. They regarded not God his Sonne, and God regarded not their ſonnes, when time came. The number of dead bodies vnburied, and the multitude of other miſeries was ſo great, that Titus himſelfe ſhaked at it, and lifting vp his hands to Heauen, cried: O Lord, O Lord this is not my doing, as if hee ſhould haue ſaid, it is thy wrath and Judgement, thy Juſtice and vengeance purſuing this people, or elſe it could neuer be thus. Certaine of them getting meate, for compaſſion ſake, in the Campe of the Enemies, were yet ſo proſecuted with this anger of God, that when they hoped their liues were in ſome ſafety, ſuddainly in the night, by the bloodie Souldier, imagining that ſure they had gold and Jewels within them, which they had ſwallowed to conuay them for their vſe, were miſerably 
                              ••
                           aine, and ſlit-vp, their bowels raked in, for that which happily was not there, to the number of two thouſand in one night, which ſore grieued the Generall Titus when he heard of it. There was a deſire to knowe the number of dead ca
                              •
                           caſes, caried out of the Citie, for want of buriall, to be throwne in the Ditches, as dung vpon the earth, but the number was numberleſſe, and no way to knowe it certainly, but out of one gate, the Kéeper had noted to bee caried out A hundred and fiftie thouſand dead bodies. Which miſerable creatures before they died, were driuen to eate the Leather of their Shooes, the Leather of their Girdles, the Leather of their Bucklers and Targets, the dung of the Stable, and in the end, their very Children. A ſtouping plague indéede, and neuer to be forgotten of Gods people, that

heare it, but to be vſed as a mighty motiue to ſtir vp their hearts euer, to a due feare of that power, that can thus cruſh them, if they will rebell againſt him. Now appeared an vſe of our Sauiours words, when going to his paſſion, he ſaid, Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not for me, 
                           Luke. 23. 28. 29. 
                           but for your ſelues, and your Children. For behold, the daies will come, when men ſhall ſay, Bleſſed are the barren, and the wombes that neuer bare, and the paps which neuer gaue ſucke. Then ſhall they begin to ſay to the 
                           30. 
                           mountaines, Fall on vs; and to the hilles, Couer vs, &amp;c, which was now verified in a moſt wofull miſerie. Let neuer Sinners then prouoke the Lord in this manner, but ſo profit by his eaſier Croſſes laide vpon them, and by his long-ſuffering-patience vouchſafed towardes them, as theſe great and terrible Teſtimonies of his anger may be euer farre and farre from them. For, if not, aſſuredly hee is the ſame ſtill, as mightie as euer, as iuſt as euer, and he hath his ſtooping plague remaining for euery man and woman, which will rebell.
                        Thus haue you ſéene the Lordes manner in former times. Come now to our ſelues, and theſe times. Surely the Lord is all one, and his dealings all one, euen with vs. For hee firſt entreateth vs by his Word, the mildeſt way that poſſibly can be, when a man or woman ſitting in the Church ſhall féele God by the Preachers ſpéech in his or her boſome, and yet no man liuing knowe it, no not the Preacher himſelfe, that he hitteth vpon them. Then, if this doth not ſerue, the Lord commeth néerer, and layeth vpon vs his eaſier Croſſes, yet greater and greater by degrées. Our friends growe vnkinde, our Seruants vnfaithfull, our Children vndutifull, our goods abate, and our health changeth to ſicknes and griefe. And if theſe alſo become vnprofitable (as too often they are) then the Lord goeth to his Quiuer, and taketh out a ſtrong arrowe to ſhoote at vs; as, The ſweating ſicknes, The deuouring plague, or ſuch like, which ſhall at once ſwéepe the Earth

cleane from ſuch rebelling Spirits, and ſtoope vs vnto Hell, becauſe vnto Heauen wee would neuer be brought. This you haue ſéene to bee true in ſome part with your owne eyes, and therefore we ought to think of it earneſtly for our amendment. Happy is the man who taketh his time to turne to his God, that he may be ſaued!
                        I reade of One, that ſaid, hee had but one Booke, and the ſame Booke had but two leaues, a white leafe, and a red; yet could hee neuer reade quite ouer thoſe two leaues, though he liued many yeeres, &amp; reade diligently, ſo much matter was contained in them. For, in the white leafe, hee ſaid, were laid downe all the Mercies and fauours of God vouchſafed to mankinde either in generall, or particular: And, in the red leafe all his fearefull Iudgements pouredout vpon ſinners, which were diſobedient, and would not be reformed. This Booke hath béene in all ages, and godlie perſons haue had a care to reade in it. Dauid looked vpon the White leafe, and ſawe (firſt) ſuch heapes of Mercies towards mankinde ingenerall, that he cried, Lord, what is man that thou art ſo mindfull of him? and the Sonne of

                           of thy hands: thou haſt put all things vnder his feete; All ſheepe and oxen; yea, and the beaſts of the field; The fowles of the ayre, and the fiſh of the ſea, with that which 
                           8. 
                           paſſeth through the pathes of the ſeas. Then in particular towards himſelfe, hee ſawe alſo ſuch Goodnes, as that he likewiſe cried, Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my houſe, that thou haſt brought mee hitherto? with all the 2. Sam. 7. 18. reſt that followeth in the Place worthie your reading fullie ouer by your ſelfe. In the Red leafe he reade ſo manie Judgements of God as that hee prayed: Enter not into iudgement with thy ſeruant, O Lord, for no fleſh liuing can be iuſtified in thy ſight. If thou Lord ſhalt marke what is done amiſſe, O Lord who may abide it; Haue mercie

vpon me, O Lord, according to thy louing kindnes, and

Others alſo haue done the like, ſéeing the infinite fauours of God, and theſe fearefull puniſhments, two and thirtie Thouſand deſtroyed for the golden Calfe, to teach men to beware of Idolatrie. Threeſcore and Ten thouſand deſtroyed with the plague, for Dauids numbring of the people, to teach men to beware of pride, and vaine confidence in any Earthly thing. Corah, Dathan, &amp; Abiram with their Families ſwallowed vp aliue with the gaping Earth, to teach men to take héede of murmuring againſt authoritie, and that which is the Goſpell, Binde him hand &amp; foote, to teach vs that what parts are ioyned in vitio, they ſhall aſſuredly be ioyned in ſupplicio. Sinne together and be puniſhed together is a Keckning that ſhall not faile. Wherefore, ſince things are thus, as well in our daies, as in former times, what remaineth but that this knowledge humble vs vnder his mighty hand, that can euer ſtoope vs at his pleaſure. Let vs remember the words of Dauid, and vſe them as our owne, Agnoſco iniquitatem, &amp;c. I knowe mine iniquities, and my Sinne is euer before mee. Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chaſten mee in thy diſpleaſure, &amp;c.
                            Let vs remember that good Saying of the Father, Non litigando, ſed flendo Deum vincimus, Wee ouercome God not by ſtriuing with him, but by weeping before him.
                            The ſtubborne Oake is torne vp by the rootes,

when the bowing Réede ſtandeth ſtill. Neuer can the lower part of the whéele come vpward, vnleſſe the vpper part goe downward: neither euer can a man in his death be glorified, vnleſſe in his life hee be truly humbled. You remember the Fable of the wiſe Foxe, who would not viſite the ſicke Lion, becauſe he ſaw not any come out, that went in; Let it profit you much to beware of Hell, from whence you knew neuer any returne, that went thither. Now is the time to thinke of theſe thinges, the continuance in Hell is for euer, and the paine there, is without meaſure. Better late than neuer to thinke of it. Our Bookes tell vs of a light woman, who ſpending her time in ſinne, deſired her wicked Aſſociate to beſtowe on her a new Gowne, which when hee did ſticke at, ſhee inſtantlie anſwered. Doo I deſperately caſt away both body and ſoule for euer to content thée, and doeſt thou miſerably denie ſo ſmall a requeſt to me? I will looke to my ſelfe héereafter better, and auoide thée, and this wicked life; which if ſhe did, it was a happy deniall made vnto her. But certaine it is that God hath many wayes to pull ſuch out of the fire, as hee will haue ſaued. The like wee reade of a Couetous Father, who raking vp riches very diſorderly, ſuddainly (God purpoſing mercie towards him) called for his eldeſt Sonne and for a Chafing-diſh of coales requiring his Sonne to put his finger in, and to burne it off. At the firſt he thought his Father had but ieſted, but perceauing in the end his ſetled reſolution, he prayed to be excuſed hee might not doo it. To whom then earneſtly his Father anſwered, and ſhal I to make thée a Great man in the world, ſo heape vp riches by all vnlawfull meanes, that Jam ſure eternally to burne both body and ſoule, and thou not endure the loſſe of one finger for mee? I will alter my Courſe in time, and conſider of that, which héereafter cannot be redreſſed. Were it true, or were it a fiction, to a wiſe man it carieth a Morrall with it. Swéete is our God if we will returne; and as yet it is day, that wee

may returne. Were thy ſinnes as red as ſcarlet, ſaith Hee, I will make them as white as ſnow. The ſacrifice of God is a troubled Spirit; A broken and contrite heart hee ſhall neuer deſpiſe. Ioſia his heart melted, and hee found it ſo. Ezechias ſorrowed, and hee found it ſo. Peter wept bitterly, and he found it ſo. Neuer any ſorrowing ſinner, but he found it ſo. God then (in mercie) ſo ſtoope vs by his Spirit, that his outward Stoopings may euer be far from vs. This example of Pharaoh preacheth vnto vs to be wiſe.
                        2. Secondly, conſider theſe words, When hee letteth 
                           Ver. 1. 
                           you goe, he ſhall at once chaſe you hence. That is, hee ſhall haſt you away without any condition, ſtop, or ſtay at all. It is euer ſwéete to the ſeruants of God, to obſerue this mighty power and out-ſtretched arme ouer all his Enemies, when once he ſetteth on to doo a thing. As here how he was able not onely to giue his people paſſage; but to make Pharaoh as glad to rid them away, as euer hee was deſirous to hold them. So in Geneſis when Abimelech 
                           Gen. 20. 2. had taken Abrahams wife, (ſuppoſing ſhee had béene but his ſiſter) God cauſed him not onely to reſtore her 
                           7. 8. 
                           without any iniurie, but he was vp very early in the morning, ſaith the Storie, to ſee it to be done, that is, hee haſted to doo it, and had no reſt in his minde till it was done. What comfort then in this God euer? what reſt and peace in relying vpon him? what aſſurance of that end, iſſue, victorie, and deliuerance that he (in his wiſedome) ſhall knowe to be beſt for vs, ſéeing he is thus able? Lord, make vs patient then, willing to tarie thy leaſure, and euer contented with thy pleaſure. For thou canſt doo for vs what thou wilt, and when thou wilt, all earthly pride muſt ſtoope to thée; and if Ieroboam ſtretch out his hand againſt thy 
                           1 Kings. 13 4. 6. 
                           Prophet, thou canſt make him neuer plucke it backe againe till thy Prophet pray for him. Who hath reſiſted him, and had peace, (ſaith Iob?) The Lord of Hoſts hath decreed it, and who can diſappoint it (ſaith the Prophet?) God would haue Ioſeph exalted, his Brethren ſtorme at

it, and practiſe againſt it; but all in vaine, when time commeth it muſt bee ſo. Saul grieueth that Dauid is likely to ſuccéede him; but all in vaine, it muſt be ſo. The Iewes work againſt Chriſt, yet to no end: for the Lords purpoſe muſt come topaſſe. The farther you go in this Meditation, the ſwéeter ſhall you finde it.
                     
                     
                        The 2. part.
                        1. THe ſecond generall Head of this Chapter (I ſaide) was an Admonition to the Iſraelites, what to doo betwéene the Denunciation of another plague, and the Execution of the ſame; Euen euery man to require of his 
                           Ver. 2. 
                           neighbour, and euery woman of her neighbour Iewels of ſiluer, and Iewels of gold; Which they did, and were greatly enriched by them. Concerning which matter remember with your ſelfe what was fore-tolde foure hundred yeeres agoe to Abraham: namely, That his ſeede ſhould be ſtrangers in a ſtrange Land ſo many yeeres; but in the end ſhould come forth with great ſubſtance. Now was it fulfilled (as you may ſée) in the next Chapter, (So 
                           Chap. 12. 36. 
                           they ſpoiled the Egyptians:) Noting by the word of (ſpoiling) a verie great meaſure of riches in thinges deſired. Wee may rightly ground this Comfort vpon it: That be the time neuer ſo long before he doo it; yet euer in the end GOD will performe what hee hath promiſed, and neuer faile. Foure hundred yeeres ſpace ſhall not hinder, but that at laſt his Truth ſhall appeare. Applie it then to what moſt may eaſe you, and be aſſured hee is the ſame. In matter of ſinne you haue his promiſe, As I liue, I will not the death of a ſinner, &amp;c. Hee ſhall neuer breake it, and therefore bee comforted. In matter of want you haue his promiſe, All theſe thinges ſhall be miniſtred vnto you; And you are better than many Sparrowes,

&amp;c. Reſt vpon it, Hee is euer true. In matter of triall you haue his promiſe, Hee will neuer lay more vpon you than he will make you able to beare. Joy in it, and know, that he cannot lye, his word ſhall ſtand, and you ſhall finde it.
                        2. But a Queſtion is mooued, whether it was lawfull for the Iſraelites thus to doo, or no? And, whether wee may imitate them and doo the like? whereunto diuers men make diuers Anſweres; and wee may take profit by them all. Baſill ſaith, Haebrei honesta astutia ab Egyptijs mercedem operarum ſuarum receperunt, qua hactenus defraudati fuerunt. The Hebrewes by an honeſt craft receaued of the Egyptians recompence for their labours, whereof hitherto they had beene defrauded.
                            Which Spéech (without reference to the Commaundement of GOD) cannot well ſtand. For the Apoſtles Rule is plaine, That no man oppreſſe or defraude his brother in 
                           1 Thes. 4. 6. 
                           any matter: for the Lord is an Auenger of all ſuch things. To lend is a dutie neceſſarie, when wee can doo it, and not arbitrarie, as appeareth by the Lawe made for Recompence in caſe of hurt done to the thing lent: which would neuer haue béene made, had it béene at our pleaſure. It is alſo a part of our loue to our Neighbour, and a breach of the Eight Commaundement, to denie, when I may lend. Wherefore, that which Auguſtine ſaith of the rich man may bee truly alſo ſaide of one that will not lend, Diues ille non damnatur quod aliena tulerit, ſed quod egentiſua non tribuerit; &amp; ad petenda minima peruenit, qui hic paruanegauit. That rich man was not condemned becauſe hee tooke from others what was not his owne, but becauſe he gaue not to others what was his owne; and he was driuen to aske leſſer things, who heere denied little things.
                            But it is withall a dutie againe (on the other ſide) truly to reſtore what is borrowed; and kindly to make recompence for any hurt done. Craft &amp; cunning (in ye matter of borrowing &amp; lending) I like not to call honeſt. Ioſephus
                           
hath another opinion in his Antiquities, namely, that the Egyptians did fréely giue theſe thinges to the Iſraelites, partly to be rid of them without any further death, (for they ſaid, we ſhall die all,) and partly in a remorſe, for the Chap. 12 33. paſſed wrongs which they had done vnto them ſo long. The firſt Reaſon may teach vs to prefer our liues before any worldly traſh whatſoeuer; (which yet many among vs will not doo;) but ſparing money in meate, in apparell, in phyſicke, in healthie dwelling, and ſuch like, caſt away the maine Chaunce, which is, their life, and looſe all. Mezentius his crueltie is ſaid to haue béene this, To tie a quick man to a dead, till the dead ſhould kill the quicke. And ſurely it is Sathans crueltie (at this day) to locke ſome ſo faſt to their dead treaſure, that in the end they periſh by it, and that eternally. S. Auguſtines Spéech is too true, Mundus clamat, Ego deficiam; Caroclamat, Ego inficiam; Diabolus clamat, Ego decipiam; Christus clamat, Ego reficiam,  The World crieth, I will faile thee;
                            The Fleſh crieth, I will infect thée; the Deuill crieth, I will deceaue thée; Chriſt crieth, I will refreſh thée; and yet for one that will followe Chriſt, the other thrée ſhall haue many. The ſecond Reaſon may drawe vs to the like remorſe when euer there ſhall be the like occaſion. For, it was a grace of God in Dauid, that his heart ſmote him when hee had ſinned: And in thoſe Iewes, that they were pricked: In the King, 
                           Acts. 2. 37. that he would aſke, what had beene done for Mordecai in recompence of his faithfull ſeruice, then reade of in that Chronicle. Our iniuries are many, and our fauours few, but thankfull requitals pleaſe God and man. An aged Maiſter and Miſtris (vnder whom you grewe vp to be able to liue) ſhould not be forgotten when God maketh you rich, and them poore. Among the vertues of Dauid this was not the leaſt, that hee carefully enquired for ſome of Sauls houſe, to whom hee might ſhewe kindnes for Ionathans ſake, &amp;c. The Third opinion in this Queſtion is S. Auguſtines, whereof I like beſt, becauſe expreſly it mentioneth

the Commaundement of God, which indéede was all in all in this point. Hoc Deus iuſſit, qui nouerat quid quem
                                 
                                    
                                 
                                 que
                               pati oportebat, nec Iſraelitae in hoc furtum fecerunt, ſed Deo iubenti ministerium praebuerunt. This God commaunded, who well knewe what was fit for euery man to ſuffer, neither did the Iſraelites in this commit any ſtealth, but yeeld their obedience to God commaunding.
                            To the ſame end ſpeaketh Nazienzen alſo. Rapuerunt ſpolia ab eo, qui dicit, meum est argentum, meum est aurum. They tooke theſe ſpoiles by the warrant of him, who ſaith, ſiluer is mine, gold is mine. Rupertus
                            ſaith, mercedem quam illi iniusté detinuerunt, hij iustè abstulerunt: The wages which they vniuſtly with-held, theſe Iſraelites iuſtly tooke away.
                            But that could not bee without warrant of Gods Commaundement, and therefore that muſt neceſſarily be vnderſtoode. Which being ſo, we plainly héere ſée (to our comfort) how carefull God is to haue his Children well recompenced for either the wrongs which they haue ſuſtained, or the faithfull ſeruice which they haue performed. The Egyptians, when they leaſt thinke of it, ſhall recompence them héere, and that fully. Iacob was thus regarded alſo, you knowe, by God for his honeſt ſeruice to Laban, when the ſheepe brought forth young of party colour, till hee was 
                           Gen. 30. 39 45. 
                           encreaſed exceedingly, and had many flockes, Mayd-ſeruants, and Men-ſeruants, Camels, and Aſſes. Neither euer ſhall any Seruant, Artificer, or painfull man finde it otherwiſe, if he walke in his place, as in the ſight of God, doing his dutie. God can doo it, God will doo it, and men ſhould be ſtaide with it both from idlenes, and vntruth in their dealings.
                        3. Another ſwéete thing we may alſo ſée by this point; namely, how Croſſes and loſſes (by a gracious God) are turned, in time, to his Childrens ioy and gaine. Abraham had no Childe in many yéeres, and to him it was a great griefe; but, in the end hee had one giuen, of whom came the bleſſing of all Nations, and a multitude like to the

Starres of Heauen (for number.) So was griefe turned into ioy to Abraham. Iacob loſt his Ioſeph, looking vpon his bloodie Coate brought home by his brethren, and O woe of woes! but Iacob had afterwerd his Ioſeph againe, with which ioy, the Scripture ſaith, the Spirit of Iacob reuiued. 
                           Gen. 45. 27. 
                           Anna likewiſe was barren, to her great griefe; but in the end ſhee had a Samuel, to her vnſpeakable ioy. Dauid endured many ſharpe ſhowers, but at laſt hee hath the Crowne, and many comforts. Mordecai his feare, and Quéene Heſters feare, howe ended they with ioy to themſelues, and the whole Nation? Tarie then Gods time, &amp; liue in his feare: you ſée what a ſwéet Regarder he is, in time, of his childrens woes.
                        4. But how came it to paſſe, that the Egyptians ſo willingly parted with ſuch thinges, when they were aſked? The Text anſwereth, and telleth you, becauſe the Lord gaue the Iſraelites fauour in the ſight of the Egyptians. 
                           Ver. 3. So are all hearts in his hand, and he turneth them euer as he pleaſeth for his Childrens comfort. To Abraham, Iſaack, and Iacob, he wrought fauour in ſtrange places with the Greateſt, and with the ſmalleſt. Nehemiah found grace with the Great King by His working: Ioſeph, Daniel, and Pſal. 84. many moe. And, the Lord giueth grace and worſhip, ſaith the Pſalme, with-holding no good thing from them that liue a godly life. Flatterie and briberie may get fading friends; but when the Lord worketh fauour, the cō
                           fort is great, and the fauour is permanent.
                        5. For our imitation of this Act, the matter is ſoone anſwered: what they did here, had warrant from him, whoſe Will is, Regula iustitiae, the Rule of right, and they did well. But ſuch extraordinarie thinges may not be followed, when the like warrant is wanting. Yet in ſome ſort we may learne of them, namely, to borrowe of the Heathens, Phyloſophers, Oratours, Aſtronomers, or the like, the beſt Jewels they haue, and to applie them to the ſeruice of God, as theſe Iſraelites did (afterward) theſe

                           Egyptian Iewels. For Diuinitie is as a Lady and Quéene Exod. 25. which ought to be ſerued by all other Sciences, and ſo, as ſeruants to her, they to be vſed. Where I remember the Saying of our olde Countey-man Beda, writing vpon the Kings: Turbat acumen legentium, &amp; deficere cogit, qui eos 
                              Quid cuius eſſet ſimpliciter confitebatur, illud aiebat Tertulliani, illud Cypriani, illud Lactantij, illud Hilarij eſt. At
                                    
                                       
                                    
                                    que
                                  in hunc modum eruditionis gloriam declinando eruditiſſimus habebatur. Hierony. de Nepotiano. 
                              alegendis ſecularibus libris omnibus modis existimat prohibendos, in quibus ſi qua inuenta ſunt vtilia, quaſi ſua ſumere licet. Alioquin Moſes &amp; Daniel ſapientia &amp; literis Aegyptiorum Chaldeorum
                                    
                                       
                                    
                                    que
                                  non paterentur erudiri, quarum tamen ſuperstitiones &amp; delicias horrebant; nec etiam ipſe Magister Gentium aliquot verſus Poetarum ſuis vel ſcripturis, vel dictis indidiſſet,  Hee troubleth the minde of the Readers, and maketh them faint, who thinketh they ſhould be altogether inhibited from reading of humane Writers, in which if there be any profitable things found, a man may take them as his owne. Otherwiſe, Moſes and Daniel ſhould neuer haue ſuffered themſelues to bee inſtructed in the wiſedome of the Egyptians and Caldeans, whoſe ſuperſtitions and delights they abhorred: Neither would the Doctor of the Gentiles (Saint Paule) haue interlaced ſome Verſes of the Gentiles either in his writings, or in his ſpeeches. More of which matter if you deſire to ſée, I referre you to S. Auguſtine, who ſpeaketh at large of it with manie Aug. de doctrina Chr. 2. lib. c. 40. others. Onely let there be no vaine oſtentation in the vſe of them, but remember euer S. Bernards words, Sunt qui ſcire volunt, vt ſciantur, &amp; vanitas est: Sunt qui ſcire volunt, vt ſciant, &amp; curtoſitas est: Sunt qui ſcire volunt, vt lucrentur, &amp; cupiditas est: Sed ſunt qui ſcire volunt vt edificent, vel edificentur, &amp; charitas est. There are, that deſire to knowe, that they may be knowne, and it is vanitie: There are, which deſire to knowe, that they may but knowe, and it is curioſitie: There are, which deſire to knowe, that they may gaine by their knowledge, and it is couetouſnes; But there are which deſire to knowe, that they may edifie others, or may be edified, and it is Charitie.
                            Thus vſing humane Writers, we ſhall no more offend, if we rob them

of ſome Iewels, than theſe Iſraelites did in ſpoiling the Egyptians.
                        
                        6. Laſtly, concerning the words, (that Moſes was verie great in the Land of Egypt in the ſight of Pharaohs ſeruants, and in the ſight of the people.) They firſt anſwere the Queſtion, why Pharaoh did not kill Moſes?
                            Euen becauſe he durſt not, in reſpect of the opinion helde of him by the multitude, as often is ſaide in the Goſpell, they forbare to doo ſuch things, becauſe they feared the people, beſides, the ſecret ouer-ruling hand of God. Againe, they ſhew how God can make his ſeruants dreadfull, and honoured of as many as he will, notwithſtanding any contempts offered them by others. Yea, ſo he honoured Moſes héere, as Stories ſay, Pharaohs Daughter was accounted in the number of the Gods, for bringing ſuch a man vp. Thirdly, they ſhewe, that, as the wicked ſtand in awe of God often, and outwardly profeſſe affection to him, yet doo not ſubmit themſelues to his Will; ſo (often) are his ſeruants honoured alſo of men with an inward conceite of them, that they are honeſt men, when yet their Doctrine will not be yéelded vnto. So doth God inwardlie imprint their owne damnation in their hearts, making them voide of all excuſe, in not obeying them, whom they did approue for Gods grace in them, and with them. Remember what you reade in the Goſpell, of Herod touching Iohn Baptiſt, namely, that Herod feared Iohn, knowing that he was a iuſt man and an holy, and reuerenced him, 
                           Marke. 9. 20. 
                           and when he heard him, hee did many things, and heard him gladly. Many things, ſaith the Text, not all thinges, for hee would not put away his brothers wife for all the reuerence he bare to Iohn: and therefore in himſelfe he condemned himſelfe by this reuerence, &amp;c.
                     
                     
                        The 3. Part.
                        1. THe third generall Head of this Chapter, I ſaide, was the Plague it ſelfe denounced, Wherein (firſt)

wee may conſider the time; namely, that it was in the night. For at midnight, ſaid God, I will goe forth into 
                           Ver. 4. 
                           the midſt of Egypt, and all the firſt borne in the Land of Egypt ſhall die. Why in the night? but that wee might learne how as well in the night as in the day the Lord executeth both iudgement and mercie. Iudgement, as we ſée in Ioſua his direction againſt Ai, whereby their fearefull Ioſua. 8. 3. ouerthrow followed: Many thouſands of them being deuoured by the ſword, and their Citie conſumed with fire: So when they ſlept, the wrath of God waked and marched towards them ſpéedily. So againe the fiue Kings in the night God directed his ſeruant againſt them, who came 
                           Ioſua. 10. 9. 10. 
                           vpon them ſuddainly, and deſtroyed them with a great ſlaughter. Thou foole, this night ſhall they take away thy ſoule, and then whoſe are all theſe, &amp;c? Other Kingdomes and Countries about vs what fearefull night-cries they haue had, when we ſlept in peace, wiſedome and thankfulnes ſhould conſider. Then for mercies in like manner you ſée the Scriptures. Salomon had that comfortable 1. Kings. 3. 5. conference with God in the night, wherein God graunted him the thing he ſought for, appearing to him in a Dreame, and ſo forth, as you reade there. Daniel in the night found Dan. 2. 19. mercie with God to haue the Kings dreame reuealed vnto him. Peter in the night was deliuered from danger: and Acts. 12. 8. Acts. 16. 25. 
                           Paule and Silas in the night ſinging a Pſalme, found the cō
                           fort there ſpoken of. So both iudgement and mercie wake and walke in the night. The vſe whereof vnto vs ſhould be euer to ſtir vs vp both to gee to bed as wee ought, and to vſe the night as the godly haue done. For the firſt take Dauids example, I will lay mee downe and take my reſt, 
                           Pſal. 4. 8. 
                           for it is thou Lord onely that makeſt mee dwell in ſafetie. And for the ſecond, hee alſo in many Pſalmes may inſtruct you. For euery night, ſaith he in one Pſalme, waſh I my 
                           Pſal. 6. 6. 
                           bed, and water my couch with teares: yea, I make my bed ſwim with teares, for ſo will the wordes beare, which Dauid did not for any puſillanimitie, or weakenes: (for

you knowe he was a man of a valiant courage:) but onelie out of a ſwéete féeling that hee had in his night meditation of the great goodnes of GOD towardes him many waies, and his owne too great inabilitie to doo to him againe for the ſame, as he deſired. And what better time can we take to plough-vp the fallowe ground of our hearts before him, and to conſider his fauours and our faults, opening euen all our woes and griefes vnto him? that as the night naturally is moiſt and ſhowrie more than the day; ſo wee likewiſe may raine-downe abundance of teares, praying for our ſinnes, and thanking him for his goodnes, knowing it as a moſt aſſured truth, that no dewe of the night can ſo glad the earth, as this ſwéete moiſture of thy wet eye in theſe reſpects doth pleaſe thy God. Good therfore was that Counſaile of a moſt honourable Father to his Childe, that aboue all other times hee ſhould haue a care in the quiet night to talke with his God. Dauid goeth Pſal. 119. 55. on in another Pſalme, and ſaith, I haue thought vpon the Lord in the night ſeaſon, and remembred him when I was waking. At midnight will I riſe to giue thanks to 
                           62. Pſal. 77. 6. 
                           Thee, becauſe of thy righteous Iudgements. In the night I commune with mine owne heart, and ſearch out my Spirits. With my ſoule haue I deſired thee in the night, ſaith Eſay. 26. 9. 
                           the Song of the Faithfull. And all theſe thinges ſhould be our inſtruction. In Iob it is ſaid, God giueth ſongs in the 
                           Iob. 35. 10. 
                           night, and it is a Place much to be thought on. Therefore I ſay againe ſince mercie and iudgement thus ſtir in the night, the one for his children, the other for his Enemies, awake thou that ſleepeſt in moſt dull ſecuritie, going to thy bed as the Dogge to his kennell, without anie thought either of God, or of Deuill. Full little knoweſt thou what may happen vnto thée before it be day. It may be with thée as with theſe firſt borne, with the fiue Kings, with the Citie Ai, &amp;c. Thy ſelfe may be dead, thy houſes on fire, thy goods ſpoyled, thy children deſtroyed, and a thouſand wofull miſeries vpon thy friends. Wherefore,

goe to bed with prayer, awake with prayer, and ariſe with prayer. Let God and grace be in thy firſt thoughts, and not anger and wrath, not Shéepe and Oxen, not money and mucke, which ſhall all periſh with thée when God is angrie. We ſee how the faithfull haue done before vs, and let it ſuffice in this point concerning the time when this plague was executed.
                        2. The ſecond thing is the Plague it ſelfe, which was the death of the firſt borne. To make vſe of it to our ſelues let vs conſider, how great a gréefe it is to haue any childe die; and that to haue the eldeſt and firſt borne to die is commonly a griefe much greater; but yet this was not all the griefe of the Egyptians. For beſides the particular griefe of any one, to haue it generall through the whole Land, and not to knowe whether God would there ſtay, or extend his wrath vpon them all (for they ſaid we all ſhall die) 
                           Exod. 12. 33. this was a thing moſt full of feare and woe. So by all theſe circumſtances the iudgement was terrible vpon them, and to them, paſt our féeling and conceite, except the Lord aſſiſt our vnderſtanding and féeling. But why, will ſome ſay, ſéeing wee all owe a death to God firſt or laſt, young and olde, and all degrées? I anſwere, that death (in it ſelfe) to any grounded vpon God is neither hurtfull, nor fearefull (yet Nature is Nature when the ſeparation commeth, and wee are allowed to mourne for them that die:) but when death commeth with a circumſtance or ſhewe of Gods anger in manner, or ſuddainneſſe, or ſuch like, then is there not that comfort which we otherwiſe haue. For Example ſake, Lot knewe well his wife muſt die, but to ſée her changed ſo ſuddainly and ſtrangely into a pillar of 
                           Gen. 19. 
                           Salt, was very fearefull and diſcomfortable both to him and all her friends. Thoſe ſonnes of Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, their Father knewe full well muſt haue a death, but to ſée them both together ſuddainly ſlaine by a fire frō
                            
                           Leuit. 10. 2. Numb. 16. 32. 
                           God, iudge in your heart what griefe it was. Corah, Dathan, ond Abiram muſt haue died, and no friend of theirs

but well knewe it, yet to haue the earth open and ſwallowe them vp with all their families, O what a dreadfull ſpectacle was it? Add vnto theſe thoſe Tormentors which died with the flames flaſhing out of the fierie fornace, 
                           Dan. 3. 22. where into they had caſt the three ſeruants of God; thoſe Accuſers of Daniel, who were caſt into the Lions denne, 
                           Dan. 6. 24. 
                           and ſhaken in peeces ere they came to the ground; Ananias and Saphira his wife ſuddenly ſmitten by the hand of 
                           Acts. 5, 5. 10. 
                           God. This Pharaoh here and ſo many of his Nobles and people drowned and ouerwhelmed in the Red-ſea, were Exod. 14, 26, 17 28. they not all full of woe and griefe to friends, more than if they had died orderly without any ſuch circumſtance of Gods anger? Surely they were. And the beſt Learned are of opinion that Dauid ſo doubled his crie for Abſolon, more in regard of the manner of his death, than of the death 2. Sam. 18, 33. it ſelfe. For hee died in rebellion againſt his naturall Father and King, he was hanged by the haire of his head betwixt Heauen and Earth in a tree, till his enemies came 
                           9. 
                           and ſtabbed him through againe and againe: There were no ſignes knowne of his repentance. Which all laid together 14. and conſidered of a wiſe Father, made his heart turne and ouerturne within him, crying, O my ſonne Abſolon, my ſonne, my ſonne Abſolon: would God I had died for thee, O Abſolon, my ſonne, my ſonne! Conclude 33. we therefore that though naturally wee muſt all die, and there is nothing more ſure; yet either the kinde of death, or the ſuddennes may depriue friends of much comfort. So was it heere in Egypt for theſe firſt borne in euerie houſe.
                        
                        3. But yet you will not iudge (may ſome ſay) all that die a ſuddaine or extraordinarie death. No indeede. For things reuealed belong to vs, and the Lords ſecrets appertaine to himſelfe. The Lords mercie is reſtrained neither to time, nor manner: and the Apoſtle ſaith, what ſhall or can ſeparate a man or woman once grafted into Chriſt? Shall tribulation, or anguiſh, or perſecution, or 
                           Rom. 8. 35.
                           
                           famine, or nakednes, or perill, or ſword? No, no. Neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, 
                           38. 39. 
                           nor things preſent, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature can doo it. No ſuddainnes of death then or extraordinarie manner which may happen to the beſt, either by naturall cauſes in their bodies, or otherwiſe, as God ſhall pleaſe in his vnſearchable wiſedome. But in ſuch caſes we are to remember (for our comfort) what Teſtimonies of Faith &amp; Religion, of vertue and pietie, they gaue in their life time, &amp; to reſt vpon thoſe. The Lord is no Changeling, but loueth to the end whom hee once loued, although ſodainly they depart, and ſay nothing. Neuertheleſſe wee entreate the Lord (if it may be his bleſſed will) to deliuer &amp; ſaue vs frō ſodaine death, and to giue vs ſpéech, memorie, and hearing to our laſt breath. Becauſe ye Laſt part is all in all of this tranſitorie life, and In morte non est locus viciſſitudini. being once gone cannot be reſtored againe (as a Carpenter can pull downe his houſe, if hee diſlike it, and make it new againe.) Alſo, becauſe it fareth with vs in this point, as with the Archer, who though he ayme at the marke neuer 
                              
                                 〈◊〉
                              . ſo right, and draw vp his 
                              •
                           owe neuer ſo ſtedfaſtly; yet, if his looſe be not good, but his hand ſtarteth aſide and ſwarueth at the point, he miſſeth. So we in death (which is our laſt looſe) not guided by Gods holy Spirit, may mar all. And therefore we pray and euer ſhould pray, that till our end, and in our end the Lord would vpholde vs in our ſtrength, and giue vs a gracious departure in him. For, as for that vaine Fable of helpe after death in Purgatorie, it ſerued to rake vp the fat of the earth to thoſe idle bellies, and to ſhift away (with faire words and promiſes) thoſe poore ſoules that ſhaked &amp; quaked after all their works, not finding any ſufficiencie in them to appeaſe Gods wrath; who could neuer returne being once dead, to tell them they lied in ſo teaching the people that Maſſes &amp; Trentalls could helpe after death. But for vs, we know the Scriptures; that, as the tree falleth either towards the North, or towards

the South, in the place it falleth, there it ſhall bee. Heauen wee reade of, and Hell wee reade of, but a Third place we finde not. Lazarus was caried into Heauen, and the rich Glutton into Hell. They that haue done well, ſaith the Catholique Faith, ſhall goe into life euerlaſting; and they that haue done euill, into euerlaſting fire. There is no Third place there mentioned to be beléeued, and it is the Catholique Faith, which except euery man kéepe holy and vndefiled, without doubt he ſhall periſh euerlaſtingly. Let counterfet Catholiques hold what they liſt, they heare the danger. S. Auguſtine agréeably héereunto ſaith, Repentance is onely in this life. S. Cyprian alſo, Hic vel accipimus, vel amittimus vitam aeternam, Heere wee either hold, or looſe life eternall,
                            meaning that if wee die well, wee holde it; and if wee die ill, wee looſe it, there being no more helpe after death. S. Baſil againe pretily ſaith, Post mercatum ſolutum nullus negociatur, After the Market is ended there is neither buying nor ſelling;
                            and, when I am dead, the Market is ended with mee. Wherefore, let all our care be to take time while time ſerueth, to liue well and doo well according to the rule preſcribed and not according to our fancies or any mans inuention, that a good life may haue a good death, in Gods great mercie and goodnes. Then, for the place, leaue it to God, as alſo the manner: and remember well, that from euery Kingdome and Country, from euery Towne and houſe, yea from all corners and places whatſoeuer, there is a readie way to Heauen. To which agréeth that pretie Conference betwixt the Huſbandman &amp; the Sayler; wherein the Huſbandman aſked, whether ye Saylers father liued, or no? he anſwered, no. Where died he, ſaid ye Huſbandman? At ſea, ſaith ye Sailer. And where your Grandfather? At ſea alſo. And where your great Grandfather? At ſea, ſtill ſaith the Sailer. Good Lord! (then ſaith the Huſbandman) &amp; do not you feare to go to ſea, ſince ſo many of your Anceſtors died there? I pray you, ſaith the Sailer, let me likewiſe know of you, before I

anſwere you, whether your Father liue, or no? and hée anſwered, no. Where then died hee? In his bed, ſaith the Huſbandman. And where your Grandfather, and Great Grandfather? In their beds alſo, (ſaith hee) I thanke God. And, good Lord! (then ſaith the Sayler) are not you alſo afraide to goe to bed, ſince ſo many of your Anceſtors died there? So, one Queſtion quit another wittily; and both of them ſhould teach vs, that no place can hurt a ſetled Chriſtian; but, as well from Sea as Land, the Lord can giue a gracious paſſage to his Kingdome, which hea in mercie graunt vs euer.
                        4. In the death of the firſt borne Note againe the degrées of Gods puniſhments in theſe plagues. Firſt, hee touched their water, ſent them Frogges, Flies, Lice, and ſuch other things, gréeuous indéede, but not ſo néere them as their goods. Secondly, the Lord touched their goods: A greater plague than the former, yet not ſo néere them as their owne bodies. Thirdly, therefore hee touched their very bodies by biles and bliſters, botches and ſores, verie gréeuous &amp; vgly, yet he ſpared their liues. But now, when all the former would not ſerue, he commeth to life it ſelfe, 
                           Ver. 5. 
                           and ſmiteth all their firſt borne, that there was no houſe wherein was not death, &amp; that of the déereſt. What may we then ſée but a continual encreaſing of Gods wrathfull ſcourges &amp; rods, as long as wee ſhall ſpurne againſt him, and not obey his holy wil? Let it touch vs and turne vs, awake vs and warne vs to take vp betimes. How long we haue followed our owne waies, and caſt behinde vs the waies of God, the Lord knoweth well and wee muſt alſo conſider. What croſſes and loſſes haue likewiſe béene impoſed vpon vs hitherto, ſhould bee remembred. For they haue all béene Gods meſſengers as theſe plagues were to Pharaoh, to drawe vs to obedience, and if they will not ſerue, the Lord will write (as ſome Judges doo) ad grauiora; that is, the Lord wil encreaſe his wrath, as he did here, till it come to very life it ſelfe. Which being once

loſt in his diſpleaſure, the ſoule alſo is loſt with the body, and both of them ſent to during woe for euer. Urge him then no further, as this curſed Pharaoh did, but to day if you will heare his voice, turne vnto him in true amendment of life, and hee ſhall turne vnto you in mercie and loue eternall.
                        5. Yea Sir, God may happily deale thus with ſome poore people for example ſake, but he will regard the better ſort of men and women who are of reputation in the world, and not bring theſe heauie thinges vpon them. But no (ſaith your Chapter heere) for this plague muſt light vpon all ſorts, from the firſt borne of Pharaoh which ſitteth vpon the throne, vnto the firſt borne of the Maid-ſeruant that grindeth at the Mill, yea, the Lord will not ſpare the very beaſts. No honours therefore or riches, no friends or ſtrength, no pompe or port in this world may defend from him, but he will ſmite all degrées, and therefore let all degrées profit by it. He will bring downe the mightie from their ſeates, and caſt euen Crownes vnto the duſt. Golde and Siluer are droſſe before him, and nothing can helpe, but a reformed heart. The ſacrifice of God is a troubled ſpirit, A broken and a contrite heart the Lord ſhall neuer deſpiſe. Truſt to this, but bid all earthly Titles ſtand aloofe, for they will not ſerue.
                        6. Then there ſhall be a great crie throughout all the Land of Egypt, ſuch as was neuer none like, nor ſhall be. This is a conſequent of Gods Plagues euer whereſoeuer they light, Cries and great Cries, woes and great woes. But ſhall any good Childe offend his Heauenly Father, till he force him to make him crie? Shall wee not thinke of the daies of truth and peace, till wee heare in euery corner of the ſtréete, kill, kill? God forbid. To learne by other mens harmes was euer yet accounted wiſedome, and therefore let theſe Egyptian Cries ſo crie in our eares and our hearts continually, as our owne Cries (through the mercy of a gracious God) may neuer be heard any where.
                        
                           
7. But againſt the children of Iſrael ſhall not a Dogge moue his tongue, neither againſt man nor beaſt, that you may knowe how the Lord putteth a difference betweene the Egyptians and Iſrael. A bleſſed ſeparation, by a ſwéet Father! able to kindle in our hearts, if we be aliue, a burning flame of loue and dutie towards ſuch a God. The like wee ſaw in the plague of moraine, and the plague of darknes before, the Cattell of the Iſraelites were ſafe, and they had light whereſoeuer they were. So ſtill, and ſo euer, if you marke the Scriptures, one way or other. Betwixt the olde world, and his ſeruant Noe, what a difference was there put? Betwixt Lot and Sodome, how did the Lord diſtinguiſh? When God ſent Ioſeph before to prouide for his Father againſt that Great future famine, did hee not put a difference betwixt his owne, and others? When the Shunammite was ſo mercifully admoniſhed of ye dearth to come, and willed to goe ſoiourne where ſhee might to preuent the danger, and when ſhee came backe againe ſo to helpe her to her Land with all the meane profites by ſuch accident of the Kings talke with Gehazi, and her fit 2. Kings, 8. comming in with her Petition while they were talking, who ſéeth not the finger of a ſwéete GOD putting a difference betwéene the Iſraelites and the Egyptians? that is, betwixt his owne, and others? In that Great deſtruction of Hieruſalem, had he not a little Pella by to ſaue ſuch as it pleaſed him to pull out of that fire? Let vs then neuer feare, we ſée he hath care of his owne, and what hee will doo, he can doo. If it be good for vs to eſcape theſe worldly woes, wee are as ſure wee ſhall, as wee are ſure wee liue. And if otherwiſe it pleaſe him to wrap vs with others in the outward puniſhment, yet ſhall wee euer be ſure to be diſtinguiſhed from them in the eternall paine; and thoſe outward griefes ſhall be but meanes to leade vs to laſting ioyes. O cleaue we then faſt vnto him, for you ſée the difference of being Religious, and being prophane, of leuing the Word, and loathing the exerciſes of the ſame. And this

difference héere will make a fearefull difference in the world to come, when you cannot helpe it, had you the treaſure of all the earth to purchaſe your eaſe withall. No not one drop of water to coole your ſcalded tongue, ſhall you be able to get with all that euer you poſſeſſed in this world, for the loue whereof (againſt all Admonitions) you haue loſt your ſelfe for euer.
                        8. Laſtly, more power againe you ſée of this mightie God in the 8. verſe, where he made the rebellious heart to ſtoope, and to ſéeke with intreatie what before could not be had with any petition. All thy ſeruants (ſaith Moſes) ſhall come downe vnto me, and fall before me, ſaying, Get thee out, and all the people that are at thy feete. They ſhall ſéeke and ſue, begge and craue proſtrate before him, that with ſpéede they would depart. O glorious God, that canſt thus humble thy foes &amp; make them fall before them whom erſt they ſcorned. Let it knit vs &amp; glue vs vnto thée for euer. I am amazed at thy Mercie, and I cannot ſpeake what I think. Lord, encreaſe our faith &amp; it ſhall ſuffice, and be well with vs.

                           verſe: This moneth ſhal be to you the beginning of moneths: it ſhall be to you the firſt moneth of the yeere. And herein remember how diuerſly diuers Nations and people haue made the beginning of the yeere. Some, when the Spring began. Some, at the Sommer Solstitium, or Stay of the Sunne. 
                           8 Calends of Iuly.

                           Hebrewes) began their yéere in March. Which order ſéemeth moſt agréeable to Nature, becauſe all things then begin to reuiue and ſhewe forth their life &amp; vigour. In regard whereof, ſome are of opinion, that the time of ye 
                           Creation of all things was then, and that the Names of our Moneths, September, October, Nouember, December, are, as if it were ſaid, the 7. the 8. the 9. &amp; the 10. from March, making March the firſt, and ſo reckoning from thence forward. But for other policies the Iewes reckoned alſo frō 
                           September: Reade Ioſephus in his Antiquities, Chap. 4. and Hierome vpon ye 3. of Ezechiel, &amp;c. With vs in England the vſuall Reckoning is frō the 1. day of Ianuary which we call New-yeeres day, yet the Merchants amōg vs vſually begin frō ye 25. of March. So ſeueral places haue ſeuerall Cuſtomes, &amp; we muſt leaue them.
                        2. Touching the Paſſeouer. The Name in Hebrewe is well expreſſed in Engliſh for our vnderſtanding, when it is called the Paſſeouer, not the paſſing ouer into the Land of Promiſe, nor the paſſing ouer the Red Sea, whereof ſée S. Auguſtine; but the Lords paſſing ouer, or the Angels 
                           Aug. tract. 55. in Iohn. 
                           paſsing ouer thoſe houſes, which had the poſts ſtriked with the blood. Therefore in the 11. verſe it is expreſlie called the Lords Paſſeouer, and ſo Leuit. 23. 5. The time of the Inſtitution was before their Deliuerance, becauſe ver. 3. things taught in affliction both better ſinke in vs, and longer are remembred of vs. The Place where it was eaten nowe was in Egypt, but after they were come into the Land of Promiſe, &amp; ſetled, we reade in Deut. thus.

But in the place which the Lord thy God ſhall chooſe to place his Name there, &amp;c. Which place being at Hieruſalem all reſorted thither at this Feaſt, &amp; ſince Hieruſalem hath béene deſtroyed, they haue not dared, write ſome, to offer elſe where.
                        
                           
3. The manner of this Paſſeouer, with the ſignification of euery thing, is next to be thought of. Where you ſée firſt a méeke Creature, ſo was Chriſt; it was a Lambe, a harmleſſe creature, ſo was Chriſt; a profitable creature (by wooll to cloath vs, &amp; fleſh to féede vs) ſo was Chriſt; his righteouſnes couereth &amp; his fleſh féedeth all thoſe that truly beléeue in him. That this Paſchal Lambe was a figure of Chriſt, remember Iohns words in ye Goſpel: But when they came to Ieſus, and ſaw that he was dead alreadie, they brake not his legges, that it might be fulfilled, not a bone of him ſhall be broken. Words written in this Chapter, ver. 46. of the Paſchal Lambe: and ſo Iohn maketh this a fore-ſhewing of that, and that a true fulfilling of this. In like ſort doth S. Paule, when he ſaith, Our Paſſeouer is offered vp, ſpeaking of Chriſt. If the Familie were too little to 
                           Ver. 4. 
                           eate a whole Lambe, then muſt they take their neighbours next vnto them to make a fit number. Whereby was noted and figured, that Chriſt is not deuided into diuers houſes and families, kingdomes and Countries, but he doth vnite and gather diuers houſes and Nations to make one Church, euen as héere many did eate one Lambe. A comfortable Figure, and worthy often remembrance. Wee may not deuide the Lambe, but we muſt gather our ſelues to the Lambe, and that is the true Church, where people are ſo gathered. Be ſure then of the Lambe, and not of the place where the Lambe once was, but now is not; &amp; féede Succeſsion of Place. Succeſſion of Doctrine.
                            vpon this Lambe, in manner preſcribed; that is, beléeue in Chriſt according to the Scriptures, and be ſure you are right: other notes may deceaue you, this will not. And if as yet you be not thus gathered, make no longer ſtay in ſo dangerous an eſtate, but be reformed, and bleſſe God for his Truth.
                        4. Your Lambe ſhall be without blemiſh, ſaith the next Ver. 5. 
                           verſe: firſt, to prefigure the puritie and vnſpottednes of Chriſt frée and cleane from all ſinne. And ſecondly, to teach that a more excellent ranſome was to be had to ſaue man

from ſinne, than in all mankinde was to be found, which wholly was ſinfull. In Apiſh imitation of which immaculate puritie our profound Romiſts take great care that their Cake be whole, round and ſound, not bitten, nor broken, but without blemiſh, as this Paſchal Lambe was: giuing themſelues rather to aboliſhed Ceremonies, than to the teaching of Chriſt now come, in whom theſe Ceremonies had end. It muſt be a Male, not a female; thereby figuring the ſpirituall ſtrength of Chriſt, according to which the Prophet Eſay ſpake of him before, That hee 
                           Eſay. 53. 12. 
                           ſhould deuide the ſpoile with the ſtrong, and that great number of Angels about the throne, euen thouſand thouſands, ſaying, that he is worthie to receaue power, and riches, 
                           Apoc. 5. 12. 
                           and wiſedome, and ſtrength, and honour, and glorie, and praiſe. Thirdly, the Lambe muſt bee of a yeere olde, thereby to prefigure our Sauiours experience of infirmities and miſeries, which euen a daies continuance in this wretched world yéeldeth both to man and beaſt, much more a yéere. Of which the Prophet alſo foretolde, when Eſpy. 53. 3. he ſaid of Chriſt, Hee is a man full of ſorrowes, and hath experience of infirmities: Surely he hath borne our infirmities, 
                           4. 
                           and caried our ſorrowes, &amp;c. Reade ouer the whole Chapter. Whereunto the Apoſtle agréeth againe, when Heb. 4. 15. he ſaith, We haue not a High-Prieſt which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities: but was in all things tempted in like ſort, yet without ſinne. The comfort and vſe whereof followeth in the next verſe. Therefore 
                           16. 
                           let vs goe boldly vnto the throne of grace, that wee may receaue mercie, and finde grace to helpe in time of neede. And indéede a Comfort of comforts it is, that in his owne bodie and our true Nature, it pleaſed him thus to taſte our woes. For hee did it onely that wee might be aſſured of his knowledge and loue, that he both knoweth our caſe better than we can expreſſe it; and in his loue towards vs, will helpe and ſuccour vs as ſhall be fit. Fourthlie, ye ſhall take it of the Lambes, or of the Kids, ſaith the

Text, To ſhadowe out how Chriſt ſhould be taken from amongſt the ſtocke of ſinfull men, from whom hee deſcended without ſinne, as appeareth by the Scripture.
                        5. And you ſhall keepe it vnto the 14. day of this Moneth, 
                           Ver. 6. (from the 10. day wherein it was taken.) Whereby Two things chiefely were figured. Firſt, that Chriſt ſhould not by and by ſuffer after he was borne, but liue and abide a certaine time in the world, and then die, euen as this Lambe taken vp the 10. day, was not killed till the 14. day. All which, we knowe, was fulfilled accordingly, he being at the time of his Paſſion about thirty and thrée yéeres olde. Secondly, it both ſerued to prepare their hearts to the right eating of it, being a Remembrance before their eies thoſe 4. daies before; and alſo to prefigure vnto vs with what meditation and preparation wee ought euer vnto our liues end, come to the eating of the true Paſſeouer (whereof this Lambe was but a ſhadowe) in that holy Sacrament which is left vnto vs, as a Remembrance of his See Beda in Exod. 11. and Galaſius in Exod. 12. vpon theſe words. Radolph. lib. 10. in Leuit. cap. 1. &amp; lib. 16. cap. 2. 
                           Paſsion for mankinde. Other conceipts haue ſome Writers, which I omit; onely I will remember His words that ſaith, Decimo quarto die immolabatur, quia tunc plenilunium est, &amp; Luna recepta luminis ſui plenitudine Sole iam occidente in Oriente conſurgit, quia morienti Christo, Sole iustitiae, Eccleſia (quae in Luna intelligitur) ad vitam conſurgit, &amp;c. The 14. day this Lambe was offered, becauſe then the Moone being at full, and riſing in her full light when the Sunne was ſet, thereby might bee ſhadowed that the Church (vſuallie ſignified by the Moone) riſeth with light and to light that euer ſhall endure in great fulnes after the ſetting of the Sunne,
                            that is, by the death of Chriſt the true Sunne both of light and life to all that faithfully beléeue in him.
                        6. It was to be killed at night; and why at night more than any other time? Surely, to note and remember vnto them alwaies the time of their Deliuerance out of Egypt, which was in the night. Againe, it might ſhadowe

out the time of Chriſt his comming in the fleſh which was (as it were) in the Euening of the world, that is, in the laſt times, 1. Cor. 10. In regard whereof (as ſome haue noted) many of his mercies and miracles were ſhewed vpon men in the Euening or towards Euening as when it is ſaide in the Goſpell, When the Euen was come, they 
                           Matt. 8. 16. 
                           brought vnto him many that were poſſeſſed with Deuils, and hee caſt them out, &amp;c. Likewiſe, in Marke, when 
                           Mark. 1. 32. 
                           Euen was come, at what time the Sunne ſetteth they brought to him all that were diſeaſed, and hee healed them. Thus ſhewing by the time of Euening that he was indéede that health of mankinde, which in the latter time ſhould come.
                        7. The blood was to be ſprinkled and ſtriked vpon 
                           Ver. 7. &amp;. 22 Ver. 27. 
                           the doore poſts with a bunch of Hyſſope; that it might be a ſigne for the Lord to paſſe ouer their houſes by, when he executed wrath vpon the Egyptians. Non quod incorporea natura huiuſmodi ſignis egeret; ſed quia conueniebat, vt per ſymbolum intelligerent illi prouidentiam Dei &amp;c. Not that God had any neede of ſuch ſignes; but that by ſuch outward meanes it was comfortable to them to knowe, and be aſſured of Gods prouidence for their ſafety, ſaith Theodoret. And it figutatiuely ſhewed the effect and vertue Queſt in Exod. 24. of Chriſtes blood the true paſchal Lambe euer to ſaue from the deſtroying Angell, as many as ſhould be ſprinkled with it, that is, ſhould make particular application of it to themſelues. For it is not the blood without ſprinkling will helpe: Chriſt dying for all ſufficientlie, but Sufficientur, non efficatetur. not effectuallie, becauſe all take not holde of the fruite of him.
                        8. It was to bee eaten roſt with fire, not rawe, nor 
                           Ver. 7. &amp; 8. 
                           boyled or ſodden in water.

                           ery aptlie ſhadowing the bitter paſſion which our Sauiour ſhould endure, beeing indéede tormented in the moſt cruell manner they could, Cuius corpus acerbiſſimis cruciatibus in cruce inaſſat
                                 •
                              m ac 
                           Galaſ. in Exod 
                           veluti torrefactuus errat: VVhoſe body was roſted, and

(as it were) broyled with bitter cruelties of deſpite and paine.
                            Alſo, it muſt be eaten with vnleauened bread, that ſuch bread might put them euer in remembrance of the ſodaine and haſtie manner of their deliuerance, when they were forced to carie their dough vnleauened vpon their backes. ver. 34. Againe, becauſe Leauen ſignifieth both corrupt Doctrine, and corrupt manners, Math. 16. 12. Therfore by vnleauened bread was taught and ſhadowed that wee muſt abſtaine from both, if wee will be worthie partakers of Chriſt in the Sacrament. Seauen daies together to eate ſuch bread, ver. 15. 19. 20. repreſented vnto them how ſerious and continued their meditation ſhould be of ſuch a Great mercie, as their Deliuerance was. And if they ſo of the ſhadowe, what we of the truth, namely of our Deliuerance from Hell, death, Deuill, and damnation? Is a light ſhort and perfunctorie Remembrance of theſe things once (at Eaſter) enough for a Chriſtian man or woman? no, no, and therefore carie another care with you, or elſe be aſſured, it will be eaſier for the Iewe than for you in that day.
                        9. It was to be eaten with ſower hearbes, to repreſent againe the ſowernes of the paſsion of Chriſt Ieſus, whoſe gripes and touching woes the Euangeliſts ſet out in many words: as, that his ſoule was heauie vnto the death, his cries ſtrong, O Father, Father, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſſe from me, his prayer ſo vehement, his agonie ſo great, that blood for ſweate burſt out of his face, and an Angell was ſent to comfort him. Were not theſe ſower hearbes? &amp;c. Others thinke they were willed to vſe theſe hearbs to put themſelues euer in minde of their ſower eſtate in the Land of Egypt vnder Pharaoh and his Officers, out of all which miſerie they were deliuered by a gracious God; either the one vſe, or the other was fit.
                        10. Nothing muſt be reſerued till the morning; but if 
                           ver. 10. 
                           any were left, it was to be burned with fire: to ſhew both literally &amp; myſtically, that both they and all true beleeuers
                           
ſhould be fully deliuered; they out of Egypt, and both they and all the Faithfull out of ſinnes Bondage by ye 
                           true Paſchal Lambe. Wherefore, as then it ſhould haue béene a gréeuous tranſgreſſion to reſerue part and not wholly to eate it, making a diuiſion of that which ought to be whole; ſo now is it as odious, &amp; damnable before God, to receaue the Bread, and not the Cup, as Poperie teacheth to doo; or, to affirme that Chriſt hath fréed vs from originall ſinne, but left vs to our ſelues to make ſatiſfaction for our other ſinnes, partly in this life, and partly in Purgatorie. For this is not to eate the Lambe whole, but to make a diuiſion, and to reſerue part till the morning. Their Apiſh burning alſo of their conſecrated Hoſts (vpon occaſion) may héere be thought vpon; and more and more their abſurd imitations of theſe Moſaicall Ceremonies be noted. Praecepit prius numeros ſufficientes ad eſum Agni ſimul imolare paſcha; docens eos fraternam charitatem &amp; miſerecordiam erga pauperes. Iam admonet vt reliquiae carnium comburantur, nec ſeruentur in posterum diem; hoc pacto compelleus illos accerſere egenos ad festum communiter celebrandum. Deinde, quód vetat carnium quippiam relinqui in crastinum, ſic intelligimus, quód futura vita ſymbolis non indiget, ipſas enim res tunc intuebimur. Hee commaunded before, ſaith Theodoret, a ſufficient number to eate the Paſſeouer; teaching them thereby brotherly Charitie and mercie to the poore. Now hee admoniſheth, that what was left ſhould be burned, and not reſerued till the next day; ſo (as it were) compelling them to call the poore and needie to them. Againe, in that nothing muſt be left till the morrowe, wee may vnderſtand by it, how in the life to come there ſhal be no vſe of ſignes, for as much as we ſhall behold the things thēſelues.
                            Now, ye 
                           paſchal Lamb, we know, was a ſigne. &amp;c.
                        11. They muſt eate it with their loines girt, their ſhooes 
                           ver. 11. 
                           on their feete, their ſtaues in their hands, &amp;c. That is, they muſt eate it like paſſengers and trauellers ready to depart: figuring ſo in ſhew, that whoſoeuer is a right Eater of the

true paſchal Lambe Chriſt Ieſus by beléeuing on him, hee muſt not ſtick downe his ſtaffe in this world, and ſay in his heart, It is good being here: but he muſt euer eſtéeme him ſelfe as a pilgrime, and ſtranger; haue his loynes girt, his 
                           Luke. 12. 35. 
                           ſhooes on, and his ſtaffe in his hand, readie to depart when the Lord calleth without any looking backe vnto Sodom, and ſinfull cleauing to this wicked world, for we haue not heere an abiding Citie. Which how they doo, who make this world their GOD, much more thinking of it both by day &amp; night than they doo of God, would be thought of whileſt there is time to amend the fault. Surely this kinde of men &amp; women eate not the paſſeouer as they ought, and therefore their danger is great. Note alſo (by the way) how He ſaith, it was the Lords paſſeouer, when it was but a Signe of his paſſing ouer, like vnto that Gen. 17. ver. 13. with many more. Whether they ſate or ſtoode, if you aſke? I take it to be out of Queſtion, that they ſtood: but afterward (when they were deliuered) they ſate, as we reade of Chriſt with his Diſciples. To giue a reaſon wherof, ſome ſay, that it was the manner of ſeruants to ſtand; of freemen to ſit; &amp; therefore they now ſtood, as a token of their bondage and ſeruitude in Egypt: but afterward (being deliuered) they ſate in token of their fréedome. Yet I rather thinke that they after ſate, becauſe they vſed (after ye 
                           paſſeouer eaten) to take their owne Supper, &amp; to bid the poore to them, thankfully diſtributing Gods gifts, &amp; reioycing for Gods great mercies to them. We kneele at our eating, and it is the fitteſt and moſt ſéemely manner for vs, offering to God our prayers &amp; thankſgiuing, as we doo. When (in the 12. verſe) God ſaid, I will execute iudgement vpon all the Gods of Egypt, S. Hierome reporteth it out of the Hebrew Writers, that in the very ſame night they departed out of Egypt, Omnia Egypti templa destructa fuiſſe, ſine terrae motu, ſiue iactu fulminum, All the Temples of Egypt were ouer-throwne, either with earthquakes, or thunderbolts. Sed vlterius referūt Hebraei, eadē nocte lignea Idola putrefacta fuiſſe,

metallica reſoluta &amp; fuſa, lapidea comminuta. But farther alſo theſe Hebrewe Writers ſay, that in the ſame night all the wooden Images were rotten, all the mettall Images were diſſolued and moulten, and all the ſtone Images broken. Which ſurely were great works and Judgements, if they were ſo.
                        12. And in the firſt day ſhall bee an holy aſſembly: alſo 
                           Ver. 16. 
                           in the ſeauenth day, &amp;c. Where we ſée the lawfull end and vſe of Holy-dayes; namely, to Remember the mercies and fauours of God, and to giue him thankes, w
                              •
                           e being by our corruption too forgetfull. As for that of S. Paule, You obſerue dayes and times, &amp;c. It doth not condemne Holy-dayes by lawfull Authoritie ordained for the ends aboue ſaide: but Superſtition and confidence in the worke. For well knew S. Paule, theſe and the like daies obſerued in the law with Gods good liking. Wee ſée alſo the Reuerence of ſuch kinde of méetings by ye title giuen them, of Holy aſſemblies: and, How monſtrouſly we abuſe them, when we make them drunken aſſemblies, &amp; curſed aſſemblies, by reaſon of all kinde of riot &amp; abhomination vſed at them! A fearefull abuſe if our hearts were fleſh to féele it: fitter for Heathens and Pagans &amp; Deuils incarnate, than for Chriſtian people that profeſſe God, &amp; ſay they looke to be ſaued by Chriſt. For can we ſay in our conſciences, when we come home, that we haue kept an Holy aſſembly vnto the Lord on theſe daies? aſke but your ſelfe that Queſtion, and I truſt there will much amendment followe of it. Marke alſo how God accepteth dreſſing of our meate, and alloweth it to vs on theſe daies, ſtill conſidering (in his mercie) our neceſſitie. But yet ſo we ought to dreſſe meate, that euer we haue a care of ye Saluation of thē that dreſſe it: who being created &amp; redéemed as we our ſelues be, ought not ſo euermore to be kept at this ſeruice, as yt neuer they may heare the word, receaue the ſacraments, &amp; praiſe God in the congregation with his people. For that ſhould be to cat the fleſh of thē, &amp; to drink ye blood of them moſt cruelly,

yea to burie them in our bellies: and for our bodies to deſtroy their ſoules for euer. Rather remember Dauids refuſall to drinke the water that was bought ſo deere; and prouide 2. Sam 23. 16 ſo, that the one being done, the other may not be left vndone. Which may, if they goe to Church by turnes, or if your eſtate be ſuch, by hauing exerciſe of theſe duties before they begin their worke in the morning, or before they dreſſe ſupper in the euening. This holy Care in you ſhall greatly pleaſe God, and be a comfort to your conſcience in your place as to the Apoſtle in his, that you are free frō the blood of your ſeruants, frée I ſay from the guilt of caſting them away for the fleſhly féeding of your body.
                        13 Then Moſes called all the Elders of Iſrael, and ſaid 
                           ver 21. 
                           vnto them, Chooſe out and take you for euery of your houſholds a Lambe, &amp; kill the Paſſeouer, &amp;c. What God had ſpoken to him he now ſpeaketh to ye people. Sée therefore (in it) the office &amp; authority of the Miniſter, What hee hath receaued, that to deliuer, calling and requiring his people to come together to heare it, &amp; if he cannot conueniently haue all, then at the leaſt the Elders and Chiefe, who both ought to come, and to their beſt abilitie aſſiſt him (their Paſtor and Teacher) in any thing belonging to his dutie. A fit Remembrance for theſe daies, wherein the beſt are vſually the worſt, that is, the Heads and guides of a Pariſh, the Gentlemen (if there be any) the Fréeholders, &amp; Wealthier ſort: for who wring and wrong the Miniſter, but theſe? who inſult ouer him, and browe beate him, but theſe? who looke to be lawleſſe, and without controlement, but theſe? Their word muſt ſtand, not Gods word; they muſt teach, and not learne; and (at a word) in ſtéede of any aſſiſtance and concurrence with their Preacher, as was here in theſe Elders with Moſes, they are the bittereſt and ſowreſt hinderers that the Meſſenger and Miniſter of GOD hath. But doth not the Lord ſée it, or doth hee ſée it, and not regard it? No, no. Hee ſhall euer be true in his word, and make them one day knowe and féele, that the abuſe of his

Miniſter in his ſeruice is the contempt of him, and that 1. Sam 8. 7. 
                           the very duſt of their feete ſhall ſtand powerfull before Mat. 10. 40. &amp;c Luk. 10. 11. 16. him againſt the bodies and ſoules of theſe proud deſpiſers, to condemne them &amp; caſt them into eternall w

                           . Therefore good it were for them to take vp betimes, and to fellowe the aduiſe of Gods holy Spirit by the mouth of S. Paule giuen: Obey them that haue the ouer-ſight of you, 
                           Heb. 13. 17. 
                           and ſubmit your ſelues: for they watch for your ſoules, as they that muſt giue accounts, that they may doo it with ioy, and not with griefe: for that is vnprofitable for you. But I haue not ſpoken theſe things generally, for I well knowe vpon my owne knowledge many ſwéete and comfortable encouragers of their Preachers and Miniſters, both of Gentlemen and others of the better ſort. Let them that are faultie amend in Gods feare, &amp; the other goe forward to their great praiſe.

If euer a man or woman forget God and dutie, it is moſt to be feared in Proſperitie, when they haue obtained what they diſired, and what with longing lookes they expected; or, as this Text ſpeaketh, when they are come into the Land of Promiſe. And therefore fitly doth Moſes héere admoniſh them, to performe this dutie, and to beware of the lulling ſléepe of forgetfulnes: which I wiſh euery one that readeth this Note to applie to himſelfe, and make religious vſe of. For who knoweth not that the heire (whileſt his Father liueth) is often well giuen, commeth to the Church, fauoureth the Miniſter, diſtributeth to the poore, diſliketh bad ſeruants, and ill companie; yea, both in his heart thinketh, and with his mouth ſpeaketh, That if Gods will bee to bring him to the Land expected, to wit, into his Fathers Place, ſurely &amp; certainly he will doo thus, and ſo, that is, very many good things ſhall flow from him.

But when God hath giuen him his deſire, who forgetteth like this man? who groweth ſluggiſh and ſlacke to come to the Church? who ſtandeth with the Miniſter for his due? who beateth the poore from his gate? who getteth and gathereth Swearers &amp; Swaggerers to wrong euery man, but this young heire now gotten where hee wiſhed to be? If I ſpeake a Truth, let ſome féele it, and for His loue, that ruleth Heauen and Earth, leaue it. Thus doth the Scholler, that wiſheth a Benefice, forget his dutie when hee hath got it, and ſuffer his people (the Lords Lambes) to periſh by his ſloath. Thus doth the Seruant, when hee is become a Maiſter: and thus doo thouſands, who (when they were vnmaried and had little) thought and ſaid, if they had ſome portion to liue vpon, ſome reaſonable &amp; competent eſtate, O how would they ſerue God, and doo good things to their power? But all is forgotten, and they are not the ſame perſons, when the Lord (in mercie) hath giuen them more cauſe to ſerue him, than euer they had. Followe this Meditation farther your ſelfe, and thinke often in your heart what a ſwéete killing poyſon Proſperitie is to many a one, and how néedefull this Note of Moſes was, That they ſhould Remember their duties to God, when they were come into that pleaſant Land of Promiſe.
                        
                        15. The Cōmaundement, To teach their children what the Paſſeouer meant, noteth vnto vs, how the Word &amp; Sacraments ſhould goe together: not hiding in an vnknowne tongue, &amp; by neglect of preaching, what Gods ordinance is, but plainly &amp; openly, &amp; euer ioyning Doctrine to it, that the people of God may knowe the Lords meaning in his holy Sacraments, &amp; ſo vſe them as they ought, to his glory and their cōfort. Yea, the children you ſée ſhould not be brought vp in ignorance, as ours are, to the great prouocation of Gods wrath againſt vs. But euen when they are young, taught and tolde what a Sacrament is, and what is meant by the Paſchal Lambe: for thus would they prooue

good ſeruants of God, when yéeres came on, and the Lord be honoured in our ſéede when we are dead. Which, whether it can be without a bleſſing from his hand, both vpon them and whatſoeuer we leaue vnto them, iudge in your owne ſoule, when you haue conſidered well how ſweete and gracious God is, how many are his promiſes, &amp; how faithfull he euer is in them. Doo therefore as followeth in this your Chapter of this people; ver. 7. They bowed thē
                              ſelues and worſhipped. That is, they thankfully receaued the Lords pleaſure at Moſes mouth, not as the word of man, but (as it was in déede) the Word of God: And they 
                           ver. 28. 
                           went their way, and did as the Lord commaunded Moſes and Aaron. A bleſſed obedience both in hearing and doing, a chéerefull alacritie and readines, ſuch as gladded the heart of Moſes, and euer will glad all godly Miniſters, Chronicled héere vp in the Booke of God by the direction of God to the laſting praiſe of them that were ſo touched and moued to obey. God (in his mercie) make it alſo profitable to thy ſoule, good Chriſtian Reader, that thou likewiſe (in the Booke of life,) mayſt be Chronicled vp for euermore. Amen.
                     
                     
                        The ſecond part.
                        1. COncerning the death of the firſt borne, which was ver. 29. 
                           the ſecond generall Head noted before to be in this Chapter, that which hath béene ſpoken before in the Denunciation may ſuffice, to which I refer you, praying that héere may be obſerued the great care of Almightie God to haue this thing well remembred, when againe he thus repeateth it with all his Circumſtances of time, of perſons, their awaking, their crying, their deſire to bee rid of the Iſraelites, their forcing of them away in all haſt, &amp;c. Surely Gods works for mankinde in generall, or for any of vs all in particular to be forgotten, muſt néedes be moſt diſpleaſing vnto him; when we ſée ſuch care as this to preſerue in his church &amp; children a due Remembrance of them.

                           Theodoret, ſpeaking of theſe firſt-borne, ſaith Cur interfecit 
                           Theodoret in Exod. 12. 22. 
                           primogenita Aegypti? Propterea quòd Iſraële prmimogenita Dei Pharaoh nimis durae ſubiecerat ſeruituti. Hoc enim ipſe Dominus Deus dixit, Filius meus primogenitus Iſrael, &amp;c. Why did he ſlay the firſt borne of Egypt? Euen becauſe Pharaoh had ſubiected his firſt borne Iſrael to too hard and cruell a bondage. For thus ſpeaketh the Lord of Iſrael, Iſrael my firſt-borne Sonne, &amp;c.
                            Againe in this, that the firſt-borne only dyed both of man and beaſt, (not the ſecond-borne, nor the third-borne,) wée may with profit well obſerue, how the differences of children are knowne to God, who is firſt? who is ſecond? and who is third? which may yéelde this vſe, neuer (for any childe) to goe about with craft and ſubtilty, or any vnlawfull inuention of man, to thruſt himſelfe into the place and prerogatiue thereof, which God in his prouidence hath not giuen him, but to abide in the order diſpoſed to him of God; and to truſt in his mercy, who ſo diſpoſed; for feare leſt God, who knoweth our order, ſeuerely puniſh vs for breaking his order. He could haue made the yongeſt the eldeſt (if he had pleaſed;) &amp; he could haue made the 3. to be the 2. (if he had ſo liked:) But he hath not done it, and what he doth is euer beſt, til his owne hand alter the ſame. A contented minde much pleaſeth God: and a working ſpirit contrary to his Will, as much offendeth him. Let it be thought on, for there is too much cauſe in the world giuen, and ſinne is counted Wiſedome.
                        2 This mightie power of God is fearefull, and comfortable. Fearefull, for that in one night, yea, in one inſtant, and with one word (as it were) he deſtroyed ſo many firſt-borne in Egypt. Comfortable, becauſe what iudgment ſoeuer he vſeth and executeth againſt the wicked, yet he can ſaue his owne in the very middeſt of death and danger, So that not a haire of their heades ſhalbe hurt. Thouſands may fall on the right hand, and tenne Thouſands on their left, yet no harme happen to them. Alſo this gratious Clemency

and Mercy in the Lord, is moſt comfortable, who when he could as eaſily and as iuſtly haue deſtroyed all, yet in his goodnes (that hath neither bottome, nor meaſure) he taketh but the firſt-borne, &amp; ſo gratiouſly humbleth thē by a few. This is that which ye Prophet ſpeaketh when he beggeth of ye Lord, in wrath to remēber Mercy: ſo noting Habac. 3. 2. 
                           his manner and nature euer full of pitty, &amp; long ſuffering.
                        3 Then Pharaoh called to Moſes and Aaron, ſaying, get 
                           Verſe. 31. 
                           you hence, &amp;c. That is, he ſent his Meſſengers vnto them to will them to depart: For Moſes ſaw him no more after the departing mentioned in the tenth Chapter, the laſt verſe: And in the eleuenth Chapter, verſe eight, you ſée Moſes foretold that thus his ſeruants ſhould intreat him to depart. Euer till now Pharaoh had ſome exceptions either of their Children, or of their Cattell, &amp;c. But now all are put in, a libertie graunted vnto all, and glad and glad to be deliuered of them. Thus can God with his mighty arme bring downe the proude ſtomakes of the greateſt, and make them yéelde to his Will wholly, not in part. A fruitfull conſideration for thoſe that dayly amongſt vs vſe to limmit their obedience to God; ſaying either openly, or ſecretly in their hearts, Herein will I follow my Teacher, and herein I will not. Adultery, Murder, and ſuch like, be great ſinnes; and I will forbeare them: but for my ſwearing, my oppreſſing of my Neighbours, my ſelling of my Benefices in my gift, my negligence at Church and Sacraments, and ſuch like, yee ſhall pardon me, I know what is fit as wel as he. Thus did Herod heare Iohn Baptiſt as I haue noted before, in many 
                           Marke. 6. 20. 
                           things, (not in all things;) and namely, not in the matter of Keeping his Brothers wife. Now Herod and Pharaoh are but bad Exampels for a man to follow, that hath any care of his ſoule: And therefore (rather) fix your eye vpon that wiſh of God in Deut. O that there were ſuch a heart in this people to feare me, and to keepe All my commandements, All, All alway, that it might goe well with

them, and with their ſeede for euer. This is a better Example: and he that thus wiſheth, hath Heauen in his right hand, to giue it vs if we héede it, and Hell in his left hand, to caſt vs into, if we deſpiſe it. Follow this meditation by your ſelfe farther, and beware of reſtraining and limiting your duty to God, but performe all obedience as the Lord ſhall inable you. And if you faile in any thing, let it be frailety in you, not head-ſtrong boldneſſe, for that is dangerous. Remember alſo how Pharaoh here deſired to be bleſſed of theſe men, who erſt were odious in his eies. The ſame God can pull you downe, and make you as glad of your Paſtors prayer for you, as you haue béene contented ſpitefully and malitiouſly to oppoſe your ſelfe againſt him. Now is the time to thinke of theſe things, &amp; ſo to vſe the meſſenger of God, as he may euer pray for you with an edge, that is, hartily and powerfully..
                        4 They tooke-vp their dough before it was leauened, 
                           Verſe. 34. and departed in haſte. The Lord knoweth euer what is beſt, (haſt, or leaſure) for his children, and ſo be appointeth. Lot was long before he would get-out of Sodom, and his wife was worſe than he. We are all couetous and gréedie of theſe worldly matters, and too loath to leaue them, when we are called. Wherefore the Lord in his great loue often preuenteth ſuch weakeneſſe in vs by a ſuddaine and conſtrained haſte. Be it therefore euer vnto vs as he will, for he is alwaies more carefull of our good than we can be. Other things here mentioned haue bene touched before, and therefore I paſſe them ouer.
                     
                     
                        The 3. part.
                        1. THeir departure now out of Egypt is the 3. general Head of this Chap. concerning which it is ſaid, that They tooke their iourney from Ramaſes to Succoth, &amp;c. 
                           Verſe. 37. This is that Rameſes which you read of in Geneſis 47. ver. 11: Where Ioſeph placed his father and his bretheren.
                           
The number alſo is ſet downe, about ſix hundered thouſand men of foote, beſide children. A moſt wonderfull increaſe from 70. Soules, which were all that came into Egypt. And moſt effectually it ſheweth vs, how able the Lord is to increaſe his Church, notwithſtanding all the malice of man &amp; Deuill whatſoeuer: Gen. 12. 21. Gen. 15. 5. I will multiply thy ſeede as the ſand of the Sea: and we ſée the truth of it. A multitude alſo of ſundry ſorts of people went with them, following the proſperity hoped for in the Iſraelites, who (they ſaw) were not touched with ye plagues of Egypt: and rightly ſhadowing what after fell out, and euer will, that Chriſt ſhalbe followed of many for the loaues, and his Goſpell embraced for the proſperitie and peace that often he vouchſafeth vnto it. Yet (no doubt) ſome follow it for Religion and Truth ſake, &amp;c.
                        2 Their time of aboad in Egypt is here ſaid to be foure 
                           Verſe. 40. 
                           hundred and thirty yeeres: which how it is to be reckoned from the Promiſe, ſée Geneſis. 15. Actes. 7. 6. Galathians. 3. 17. and ſee Interpreters, by name Calaſius, who reckoneth euery yéere in particular. Note we, and alwaies remember, that ſo carefull was the Lord of his promiſe, as, When the 400. and thirty yeeres were expired, the ſelfe ſame day they departed, euen the ſelfe ſame day. Euer it may comfort vs in our ſpirituall feares and conflicts, that certainely the Lord will neuer faile in any promiſe, but euen dayes and howers of comfort fit for his Children, as they are knowne to him, ſo are they obſerued of him moſt mercifully, moſt gratiouſly, and moſt preciſely. Why then ſhould not I (duſt and aſhes) tarrie his good leaſure in aſſured hope, and in peace of Soule, waiting for the good houre? but I muſt needes tye the Lord to my time, and to my will, or els I faint, I fall, I ſpeake or thinke amiſſe, That the Lord regardeth me not, but hath forgotten me, and forſaken mee, and all that Sathan my ſworne-Enemy ſuggeſteth is true. O, doo it not any more, neither

euer wrong your gratious Father and déere God ſo much, who you ſée breaketh not with theſe Iſraelites one day, but the very ſelfe ſame day deliuereth them which was apointed 400. yeares before. God ſtrengthen vs, for his Son ſake; for we are weake, but he is faithfull for euermore.
                        3 Some other circumſtances touching the Paſchal 
                           Verſe. 43. &amp;c. 
                           Lamb are héere noted in the end of this Chapter, omitted before; namely, That only ſuch as were circumciſed might 
                           Ver. 44. &amp; 48. 
                           eate of it; ſo figuring, that of the true Paſſeouer Chriſt Ieſus they onely can be partakers, hauing their hearts circumciſed and purged by faith, &amp;c. And being circumciſed, ſeruants might eat; ſhewing that bond and frée are alike accepted of God. That it muſt be eaten in one houſe, ſignified Verſe. 46. that out of the Church Chriſt is not to be found. Not a bone muſt be broken, which was fulfilled in our Sauiour Chriſt, as was touched before: yet héere remember Theodorets wordes, Oſſa conterunt Agni, qui male intelligentes eloquia Diuina, ad ſuam impietatem illa detorquere conantur. They
                            may be ſaid to breake the bones of the Lamb, who ill vnderſtanding the holie Scriptures, go about to wreſt them to their impieties. One Law muſt be to him that is 
                           Verſe. 49. 
                           borne in the Land, &amp; to the ſtranger that dwelled among them: which ſignified, that whoſoeuer, vnto the worlds end, will liue in the Church, he muſt and ought to be gouerned by the Lawes of ye Church. Finally, The obedience of the people (héere mentioned) in all things to Moſes and 
                           Verſe. 50. 
                           Aaron, teacheth vs the like obedience euer to Magiſtrate and Miniſter ouer vs, which the better we performe the more aſſured may we be that we are true Iſraelites. Thus may this Chapter profit vs in Gods bleſſing.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. 13.
                     
                        
                           The generall Heads of this Chapterare chiefely theſe.
                           
                              1. The Sanctification of the firſt-borne to the Lord.
                              2. By what way the Lord led them.
                              3. The Signes of direction vouchſafed to them.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           COncerning the firſt; The Paſchall Lamb (as hath béene ſhewed) was a liuely remembrance of the Lords paſſing ouer their houſes, and not ſlaying their firſt-borne, as he did the Egyptians: yet doth God héere againe inſtitute, for an other Remembrance of it, that all the firſt-borne ſhould be offered to him in ſacrifice. Verſe. 1. Which plainely ſheweth our dulnes to be ſo great, that either not at all, or very ſlightly wée remember the Lords mercies and benefits, vnleſſe by ſundry meanes we be raiſed and ſtirred-vp thereunto. Let vs therefore thinke of our ſelues as the Lord knoweth vs to be, and reſt euer thankefull for this great care of his ouer vs, teſtified in his ſundrie waies and meanes to awake and worke in vs due duties towards him, and vſe the ſame appointed meanes continually and euer, as we are commaunded: otherwiſe, we condemne both the Lords care, and wiſedome: and the puniſhment at laſt muſt néedes be very fearefull. Let it ſtrike all negligent hearers of the Word, all ſecure and earthly contemners of the Sacraments, all that refuſe to read, to conferre, and to doo whatſoeuer els as a meanes that leadeth to the Lord. The Reaſon which the Lord aleageth of this Law of the firſt-borne to be ſanctified vnto him, is, becauſe they were his, (for they are mine, ſaith he.) Which doth not note any reiectiō of the ſecond-borne,

or third, from his grace and fauour, or yet tye his mercy and liking euer to the eldeſt (for we know, He hated Eſau, and loued Iacob:) but we are to vnderſtand it thus, that albeit all were his indéede, yet theſe firſt-borne he challenged to be his by a double right; both becauſe he had deliuered them from bondage and ſeruitude as the reſt, and becauſe he ſaued them aliue, and ſlue them not, when he killed all the firſt-borne in Egypt. I make this vſe of it, euen to think with my ſelfe, That the more God hath done for me, the more titles he hath vnto me, and the more I am his, and ought to be in al the duties and ſeruices that may flow from either heart or body of ſo wretched a creature. And if I doo not ſo thinke, and ſo ſtriue to ſhew my ſelfe, euen ſo many witneſſes againſt me are his ſundry mercies to me, and I ſhalbe deſtroyed. The ends then of this Law of ſanctifying the firſt-borne vnto the Lord, were theſe; To be a Remembrance of their deliuerance; To be a witneſſe of the Lords right to them, and ouer them, whom he had ſo gratiouſly and mightily deliuered (euen as an earthly Lord ſéeketh a peny or a Roſe for an acknowledgment of his right, not for any increaſe of his welth:) That the Prieſtes might haue hereby a maintenance to liue to preſerue doctrine &amp; knowledge among them; That Chriſt hereby might be liuely ſhadowed and ſhewed, who being the firſt-borne, was offered-vp a holy and ſufficient ſacrifice for all our ſinnes, &amp;c.
                        The Law of Redemption of the children, ver. 13. 15. was to mittigate the rigour of the Lawe, if they ſhould haue dyed; and ſtill ſheweth, how ſwéete and mercifull the Lord is. Afterward, the Leuites were taken in their place; and the Redemption of the vncleane beaſtes teacheth vs, that God will haue his due, if not by ſacrificing them (becauſe they were vncleane,) yet by a price for them, or by their death. Which all wicked Robbers of God in his Tithes and Offerings may make an vſe of: and ceaſe ſo to offend any more, if admonition

may finde place with them. Other things haue béene touched before, as the vnleauened bread, the inſtructing of their children and ſuch like; wherefore I paſſe them ouer. The frontlets ſpoken of in the 16. verſe (béeing for Remembrance) 
                           ver. 16. the Iewes afterward abuſed and had their Philacteries, &amp;c. As our Papiſts haue ſundrie ſuperſtitious things about their neckes and armes, to put them in minde of I know not what.
                     
                     
                        The 2. part.
                        1 COncerning the way by which GOD led them, you ſée héere in the 17. verſe what is ſaid; namely, Ver. 17. That God caried them not by the way of the Philiſtims Country (though it were neerer,) leſt any ſhould repent when they ſaw warr, and turne againe to Egypt. Si enim cum longius eſſet (Numb. 14) regredi voluerunt, quid ſi tam vicini eſſent? For if, when they were farther of, they would haue returned (Numb. 14.) what, when they were ſo neere? (ſaith Saint Cyril:) wherin behold a moſt ſingular Teſtimonie of Gods fatherly care ouer our infirmities, in not ſuffering vs to be farther tryed, than in him, and through him we ſhalbe able to indure, and at the laſt to ouercome alſo, according to the moſt gratious promiſe ſpecified by the Apoſtle. 1. Cor. 10. 12. Let a troubled Spirit euer thinke vpon this, and euen féede upon it to the comfort of Soule, as one would féede vpon ſwéete and pleaſing meate, for the good of bodie. Your weakeneſſe is knowne to God; and (as you ſée here) he thinketh before hand what you can beare, and what you cannot; what will lead you to the Land of promiſe, and what will make you turne backe to Egypt; and had he not ſtrength in ſtore for you in his good time to be giuen you, thereby to ouercome the troubles you now are in, whatſoeuer they are, ſpirituall or worldly, in ſuch ſort as he knoweth to be beſt; truly hee would haue preuented them, and neuer

haue ſuffered you to fall into them, more then hee would ſuffer héere the Iſraelites to paſſe by the Countrie of the Philiſtims; for he is not the God of the Iſraelites alone, but your God and my God alſo; no reſpecter of perſons, but ſwéete to all that cleaue vnto him. And therefore ſince theſe things are thus now with you, reſt in hope, and be chéerefull; there is a good houre comming, aſſure your ſelfe, wherein his ſtrength ſhall appeare and giue you victorie, theſe things turning to your good, and not to your harme. For, euen as an Eagle fluttereth ouer her birds, ſtretcheth out her winges, taketh them and beareth them vpon her wings: ſo doth the Lord for his people, ſaith the Song of Moſes: and let it comfort you, for God is true. Deut. 32. 11.
                        
                        Another vſe againe I make of this place thus. The Lord héere (I ſée) would not ſuffer them paſſe by the Philiſtims, leſt they ſhould ſtart backe, and ſo ſinne gréeuouſlie againg him. And what if in like ſort hee preuent my ſinning, and your ſinning againſt him, by taking away from vs ſuch things, as he in his wiſedom knoweth would be occaſions of euill vnto vs, if we had them, whatſoeuer we thinke, as Riches, friends, power, health of body, peace of minde and ſuch like, is not he therein carefull of vs, and as gracious vnto vs, as héere hee was to theſe his people, in not ſuffering them to goe that way, which (though it were néerer) night endanger them?

                        2. The Children of Iſrael went vp armed out of the 
                           Ver. 18. 
                           Land of Egypt, ſaith the Text. And it may teach vs warineſſe and circumſpection in our vocatiens; euer reckoning of the enemie in this our holy march towardes the Land of Promiſe. Ioſephs bones are caried away with 
                           Ver. 19. 
                           them, according to the oath made vnto him; which may teach vs faithfulnes and truth in the deſires of dead men euermore: a thing alwaies of good regard with good men, and too little regarded by many that would be iudged good men. But no ſhewe of warrant héere for the Popiſh fooleries and impieties vſed about their Reliques. For this promiſe to tranſlate his bones, was taken by Ioſeph to ſhew his Faith in the promiſe of GOD, touching the Land of Promiſe to be giuen in time, and it was performed by the Iſraelites in diſcharge of truth without any ſuperſtition, or Idolatrie, as in Poperie is vſed moſt offenſiuely.

                        THe laſt generall Head is, concerning the ſignes of direction which the Lord vouchſafed them; namely, a 
                           Ver. 21. 
                           Cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by night. Whereof the Pſalme ſpeaketh, alluding to this Storie, In the day time 
                           Pſal. 78, 14. 
                           he led them with a Cloud, and all the night long with a light of fire. And againe, Hee ſpread a cloud to be a couering, and fire to giue light in the night ſeaſon. By this Pſal. 105. 39. Great miracle ſhewing that ye 
                           Iſraelites deliuerance was from himſelfe, and by no other meanes vnder Heauen. Secondly, that hee was preſent with them to defend and ſaue them from all their enemies. And thirdly, that in like ſort hee guideth and protecteth his faithfull, marching out of Egypt towardes the promiſed Land, through the Wildernes of woe and affliction: which indéede hee ſtill doth by his Word and Sacraments, two guides to vs as

theſe pillars were to them. So neceſſarie is it after deliuerance to be guided, that without the one the other will not ſerue. And if more particularly you wil meditate on them, conſider in ye 
                           Cloud, how it not only directeth the way, but is ſpread, as the Pſalme ſaith, for a couering; namely, againſt the heate of the Sunne, ſauing them from the violence thereof, and comfortably cooling and refreſhing them. Remember alſo howe the afflictions of this world in the Goſpell are noted by the heate of the Sunne. And be you aſſured in a true Faith, that euen euer, euer, againſt theſe heates the Lord, in his good time, will ſend you defence and comfort. For ſtill you muſt know that yeſterday, and today, and for euer He is the ſame. Meditate on the Apoſtles 
                           Heb. 13. 8. experience, 2. Cor. 1. Bleſſed be God, euen the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the Father of all mercies, and 
                           2. Cor. 1, 3. 
                           the God of all comfort, which comforteth vs in all our tribulations, (ſée the cooling Cloud) that wee may be able to 
                           4. 
                           comfort them which are in any affliction, by the comfort wherewith wee our ſelues are comforted of God. For as the ſufferings of Chriſt abound in vs, ſo our conſolation 
                           5. 
                           aboundeth through Chriſt, &amp;c. Thus to Paule, thus to you, thus to all aſſuredly. In the other pillar of fire obſerue, that (beſide direction by going before) it alſo gaue light vnto them in the night. And thereby learne with a féeling comfort, that whoſoeuer followe Chriſt as their Guide and Leader, they ſtill haue light in others darknes. So ſaith Hee himſelfe, Hee that followeth mee, ſhall not 
                           Iohn. 8. 14. 
                           walke in darknes, but ſhall haue that light of life. In both the one and the other ſée a Notable Figure of Chriſt, in whō there is cooling, &amp; without whom there is ſcorching heate; in whom there is light, and without whom there is helliſh darknes: In the world yee ſhall haue trouble, but in mee yee ſhall haue peace. The wordes which followe, (That they might goe both by day and by night) moſt notablie remember vs, that in trauelling towardes the ſpirituall Canaan we muſt not reſt, but labour forward continually.

The Chiidren of this world are often looking back toward Egypt, and often pitch downe their Tents: ſo in this Wildernes, that they are loath euer to take them vp and to remoue. But with the Sonnes of God it is not ſo, but they ſay with themſelues, We haue here no abiding Citie: and fixing both eye &amp; heart on their Heauenly houſe, they iourney on ſtill both day and night in true pietie and obedience: and they are not quiet till they haue attained to the Hauen, &amp; ſée their God with his holy company in the higheſt Heauens. Laſt of all, when it is ſaid, Hee tooke not away the 
                           ver. 22. 
                           pillar of the Cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night from before the people. Let it euer aſſure your fearing heart, cooling &amp; comforting, ſhining and lighting, guiding and directing his little flocke, ſhall neuer be taken away frō any member thereof, but euer be readie &amp; preſent with vs both by day &amp; night, to the eternall praiſe of his goodnes, and vnſpeakeable comfort of our ſoules; bleſſed againe and againe be his name for it. And thus far of this Chapter.

                              4. The Lords deliuerance of them.
                           
                        
                     
                     1. TOuching the firſt, marke what a ſtraite the Lord brought his people into, when He commaunded Moſes to ſpeake vnto them to 
                        ver. 1. &amp; 2.

                         where the Sea was before them, Mountaines

on either ſide, and Pharaoh with his Hoſt at their backes, the Lord hardening his heart to follow after them: yet was not this diſtreſſe for their hurt, but for their good, that God might be honoured, they miraculouſly deliuered, and their enemies gloriouſly ouerthrowne. How then doo wee feare in euery aduerſitie before wee ſée the end? Surely we wrong the Lord much, and our ſelues, in ſo doing; he being as good, as euer he was; as mightie, as euer he was, to finde meanes; and as iuſt as euer hee was to puniſh our malicious enemies. O, thinke then with your ſelfe, and reaſon thus: Loe, héere I am diſtreſſed on euery ſide, as the Iſraelites were at the Red-Sea: and it is the prouidence of God, that I ſhould be thus, as it was his Will they ſhould pitch in that place. But doo I know the Lords meaning, &amp; what he will doo? No indéede. And therefore I will patiently waite for his bleſſed Will, not murmuring as the Iſraelites did, but comfortably aſſuring my ſelfe, that one way or other the Lord will giue iſſue to his glory and my good (although as yet I ſée not how) becauſe hee is no Changeling in his loue to his Seruants, and did (beyond all conceite of man) deliuer theſe Iſraelites from this perill. Surely there can be no perplexitie in this world greater than this was, if all things be conſidered, and yet all was moſt well in the end. Remember we therefore alwaies the words of Dauid in his Pſalmes, When I am in heauines I will thinke vpon God, when my heart is vexed I will complaine. I wil cry vnto God with my voice, yea euen to God 
                        Pſal. 77. 1. &amp;c. 
                        will I crie with my voice, &amp; he ſhall hearken vnto me, &amp;c. The whole Pſalme is comfortable, if you reade it.
                     2, For Pharaoh will ſay of the children of Iſrael, they 
                        ver. 3. 
                        are tangled in the Land; the Wildernes hath ſhut them in &amp;c. So they were indéede, if wee conſider the place where they were: yet there is no tangling where the Lord will haue a paſſage. But ſée you here in your Meditation, how, when the deſtruction of the wicked is at hand, the Lord (in his iuſtice) offereth them ſome baite or other to pull them

on: that, as here He ſaith, He may winne his honour vpon them, &amp; they know he is the Lord. So was Ahab drawne Ver. 4. to his end with a deſire to recouer Ramoth Gilead which 1. Kings. 22, 3. once was his, the bait allured him, the wrath of God flewe him. So were Senacharib &amp; the Aſyrians baited, as it were, with former ſucceſſe with their multitude, &amp; the ſmallenes of Ezechias his number. But how gloriouſlie did the Lord deliuer his, and deſtroy them that ſo boaſted? Many ſuch Examples may you remember by your ſelfe, all teaching what a ſure thing it is to belong to God, &amp; to haue our truſt in him onely. For otherwiſe there will be a time of falling for vs, &amp; we ſhall euen runne vpon it gréedily as theſe men did. You may alſo here think of the number noted by Ioſephus, who addeth to the 600. Chariots mentioned in the Text, ver. 7. fiftie thouſand Horſemen, &amp; two hundred thouſand footmen more, all marching after Gods people with great confidence &amp; iolity, &amp; yet all ouerthrowne in the déepe by a mighty God moſt eaſely: So great a God is our God, and it muſt euer comfort vs, &amp; make vs ſtrong. Obſerue againe their words vttered before they purſued after them, Why haue we this done, &amp; let Iſrael goe out of our ſeruice? 
                        ver. 5. Which ſheweth how quickly the wicked repent them of their good, but ſeldom or neuer of their euill. For to let them go was good, &amp; yet they repented; but to purſue after them was euill, &amp; they repented not. Many ſuch there be in our daies which often grieue at an houre ſpent in the Church, and neuer of daies &amp; yéeres ſpent in ſin. But let them looke vpon theſe Egyptians here, &amp; be warned in time, if God ſo will. The difference of the hoſts againe in this place is verie worthie obſeruing, the one all warriers &amp; well appointed, the other full of weake women &amp; little children. The chiefeſt men without great munition or any exact order militarie to match with them, yet the weaker liueth, &amp; the ſtronger dieth: euer to teach vs to fixe our harts vpō God, &amp; not to be tied to outward ſhew, For there is no wiſedom, 
                        Pro. 21. 30. 
                        no counſell, nor ſtrength againſt the Lord. The horſe is

prepared againſt the day of battell: but ſaluation is of the 
                        31. 
                        Lord. And as the Prophet Eſay ſaith, Gather together on heapes, O yee people, &amp; yee ſhall be broken in pieces, and 
                        Eſay, 8. 9. 
                        hearken all yee of far Countries: gird your ſelues, and you ſhall be broken in pieces, gird your ſelues &amp; you ſhall be broken in pieces. Take counſaile together, yet it ſhall be brought to naught: pronounce a decree, yet ſhall it not 
                        10. 
                        ſtand: for God is with vs, &amp;c. Repeating things ouer and ouer, that we may be aſſured, &amp; alwaies ſtrong in him.
                     3. Againe I ſée héere, and marke it for my good, that when wee are once deliuered out of Egypt, then doth the Deuill muſter his Chariots &amp; Horſemen, &amp; after vs he wil, if he can get leaue. He cannot abide to looſe his ſeruants ſo, His we were, &amp; he hath loſt vs, and his we muſt be againe, if by all his ſtrength he can poſſibly gaine vs. A Land that floweth with milke and honey, may not be inherited without reſiſtance. Out of Egypt wee may be deliuered, but from following afflictions we ſhall not be quite fréed. Hue and Crie will be made by Hell after vs, &amp; we ſhall be tried as God pleaſeth. Thinke of that Deuill in the Goſpell, who when he muſt néedes depart &amp; looſe his poſſeſſion, did rend 
                        Mark. 9. 26. 
                        and teare the poore party moſt cruelly. Thinke of thoſe Stories of the Primatiue Church, how Nero, Domitian, Diocleſian, &amp; all thoſe perſecuting Emperours purſued the Chriſtians, deliuered from darknes to light. What were they all but Sathan Hoaſt, doing then as Pharaoh did here by the mighty hand of a iuſt reuenging God. The Land of Canaan is ours, but in our way thither looke for lets. When the Deare is hued-in by the Hunters, &amp; the dogges placed to make a courſe, if hee take his way vpon the Dogges, euery man is ſilent, and letteth him goe, for that is the way to death, and it well pleaſeth the Hunters. But if hee offer to breake out ſome other way, &amp; to eſcape the Dogges; then they crie and beate the hedges to driue him backe againe, and if he eſcape, how diſconted are they? So, ſo, in our Deliuerance from Death and Hell doo wee

plainly ſée it. And therefore hoping for the beſt, when God ſhall ſée it fit, be prepared alwaies in your ſelfe for ye worſt, and (reckon of it) Pharaoh will purſue you.
                     
                     4. When Pharaoh drewe neere, the Iſraelites wereſore 
                        ver. 10. 11. 
                        afraide, and cried vnto the Lord. Others ſaid vnto Moſes, haſt thou brought vs out of Egypt to die in the Wildernes, &amp;c. Philo ſaith, Quatuor tribus in aquis ſubmergi voluiſſe, 
                        Philo in vita Moſis. 
                        ne ad Aegypttorum manus peruenirent; alias quatuor ſe tradere Aegyptijs constituiſſe, cum ſpe veniam impetrandi; ſed reliquas quatuor (ſcilicet, Iuda, Leui, Ioſeph, &amp; Beniamin) vſ

                            ad mortem cum illis pugnare decreuiſſe. That 4. Tribes reſolued to drowne themſelues in the waters, rather than to fall into the Egyptians hands; other 4 Tribes determined to ſubmit themſelues to the Egyptians, in hope of pardon and forgiuenes; but the 4 Tribes left after theſe (namely, Iuda, Leui, Ioſeph, and Beniamin) ſetled themſelues to fight (as long as they ſhould be able to ſtand aliue) againſt them.
                         Note then héere how affliction trieth what is in vs: for ſuch as héere reſted vpon God cried (you ſée) vnto him, and no doubt hoped of helpe from him, well conſidering that, vbi humanum deest conſilium, ibi Diuinum 
                        
                           Aug. in Pſ. Qui habitat. 
                        adest auxilium. Where mans Counſaile faileth, there Gods helpe is preſent.
                         Others not ſo grounded &amp; ſetled, foulely and ſinfully diſcouered their corruption, &amp; quarrelled with Gods Miniſter ſent for their comfort, reproaching him bitterly, as you ſée in the Text. Looke therefore how the fire trieth the gold, parting the droſſe from that which is pure: ſo doth aduerſitie try ye ſonnes of men, &amp; ſeuer the good from the 
                           •
                        uill. Be we rooted therefore in his holy promiſes, and looke not too much vpon heapes of men as theſe murmuring Iſraelites did; for it is all one with the Lord to ouercome many and fewe, and with many, or few. Faith muſt euer looke at him, and ſay chéerefully as Dauid, The Lord 
                        Pſal. 27.

                        ver. 13. 
                        but ſtand ſtill, and beholde the ſaluation of the Lord which hee will ſhewe to you this day. For the Egyptians whom you haue ſeene to day yee ſhall neuer ſee againe. The Lord ſhall fight for you, therefore holde you your 
                        14. 
                        peace. Ioſephus relateth a long Oration wherewith Moſes exhorteth them: but theſe wordes are effectuall, 
                           Ioſephus 2. antiq. cap. 14. and containe the ſubſtance. A worthie and wonderfull ſtrength in the ſeruant of GOD, who héeretofore looked at the difficulties of his Calling, at his owne weakenes and wants, and at the ingratitude of men towardes thoſe that haue beſt deſerued; yet now raiſeth himſelfe aboue all theſe in a moſt holy Faith, and comforteth the people with aſſurance of a great and moſt gracious Deliuerance. Thus can the Lord giue ſtrength to any man in his vocation when hee will, making him mount aboue all earthly conceites, and to ſée nothing but the power of God, and truth euer in his promiſes. Wherefore pray for this Grace in all touches and plunges of this miſerable world: And learne of Moſes here, by vſe &amp; experience to caſt behinde vs the vndeſerued ſpéeches of men either malitious or vnthankfull, and bee ſtrong and chéerefull in our Charge, notwithſtanding a thouſand of them. Learne alſo of him, both in our ſelues to be aſſured, and to aſſure others in the diſtreſſes of the Church: that, as God waketh when we ſléepe, ſo will hee fight for vs, when we ſt

the heate of the Sunne was tempered; and in the night a comfortable light giuen ſaith Greg. Nyſſen writing of the life of Moſes. The comfort and vſe I take from it, is this, that in new perilles the Lord can haue new remedies at his pleaſure: Now before vs, and now behinde vs, and euermore with vs, if wee bee with him by a ſure truſt in his goodneſſe, bleſſed be his Name euermore for it. ver. 21. Pſal. 22. 
                        The winde which the Lord vſed, to cauſe the Sea to runnebacke, was not for any néede of ſuch meanes, but that he might ſhew his power ouer all creatures, to vſe them &amp; commaund them at his wil. So by the water of Iorden he healed Naaman; when he could haue healed him without it. By clay and ſpittle he opened eies, and diuers ſuch things in the Scriptures, when (at other times) by his only Word he did as much, without any meanes at all. Then went they through, on dry land, and the waters ſtood as a wall vnto them, on the right hand, and on the left. If you aſke, how they durſt aduenture to paſſe ſo dangerouſly, ſeeing the waters might haue guſhed together againe, and haue ouerwhelmed them? The Epiſtle to the Hebrewes telleth vs, That by faith they paſſed through the Red-ſea as 
                        Heb. 11. 2

                        by dry land, which when the Egyptians had aſſaied to doo they were ſwallowed-vp. If you looke at the waters on either ſide, you may ſee the condition of Gods Children in this world, beſet on the right ſide with a floud of proſperitie, &amp; beſet on the left ſide with a floud of aduerſitie: &amp; yet (through a true faith) walking through both, and hurt by neither, they arriue on the other ſide ſafely, when by either of theſe many others are deſtroyed: pray we then euer for this Faith.
                     
                     8 The Egyptians féele the Lord againſt them, and Ver. 25. then would flie, but it was too late. And let it euer preach vnto our mindes the danger of deferring our conuerſion to GOD. For when wée would, wée ſhall not; but euen periſh and die, as here did the Egyptians. O what newes in Egypt was this, when it came? what woe, and what weeping? what wailing and

wringing of hands by wiues for their huſbands, children for their Fathers, and friends for their friends which now were deuoured of the cruell Sea? But it is too late: Had I wiſt commeth euer behinde ſaith the old Prouerbe. And therefore a notable Example is this to all degrees, one to perſwade with an other vnto Religion and the true ſeruice of God, that ſuch fearefull newes may neuer be brought to our friends of vs. For the Lord will not euer beare with our contempt, but as here was a heauie Morning, 
                        ver. 27. when the Sea roaring returned together, and they flying and crying in the middeſt of it: ſo aſſuredly ſhall there be either a morning, or an euening of miſerie vnto them who proudly diſdaine to be taught of their God: happy are they that thinke of it in time.
                     9 The glorious victorie of the Church here is a thing worthy all due conſideration; yeelding vs comfort to the ver. 28. worlds end in all our perplexities. For, how doo they ſee their enemies deſtroyed, and themſelues deliuered? how triumph they in Songs of ioy and gladneſſe in the next Chapter, verſe 1. &amp;c? This is the Word, and we muſt beléeue it; theſe are his promiſes, and we muſt be ſtrong in them. The Church is Chriſts body,

So is his Church right deare vnto him, you plainely ſée; and it is the comfort ſtrong of euery member: For the loue of the body draweth a loue of the hand and foote and euery part, we ſee in experience by our owne bodies. No part can periſh without a great greife to the whole, neither the vileſt part bee but a little touched, without an offence to the very heart. What compariſon betwixt vs, and Chriſt, in our loue, and his? None, none, and the more he exceedeth vs, ye more is our comfort &amp; ioy.

And ſo of thoſe perſecuting Emperours till godly Conſtantine came. A Ship hath a Gouernor to direct her, and ſo hath the Church her Pilots alſo. And as in the Ship the Pilot may not be blinde, that he cannot ſée Recks and Promontories dangerous to be touched; may not be deafe, that he cannot heare the aduiſe of others; may not be vnskilfull in times and ſeaſons, with many other things: euen ſo much leſſe may the Church Gouernours be ſuch. The Mariners in a Ship may not be without hands, vnable to row when there is neede; no more may Men in the Church be vnfit for the places they poſſeſſe. In the Ship there are many Offices, and yet all care for the Ship; ſo in the Church there are diuerſity of adminiſtrations and yet al muſt labour for the Eph. 4. 11. 1. Cor. 12. 8. 
                        Churches ſake. Some Prophets, ſome Apoſtles, ſome Euangeliſts, ſome Paſtors and Doctors. To one is giuen by the Spirit the word of wiſedome: and, to an other the word of knowledge: To one faith, to an other the gift of healing &amp;c. There be Ships of true men, and Ships of Pyrats; ſo there is a Church true and a Church falſe. The falſe Church falleth, when it riſeth; And the true church riſeth, when it ſéemes to fall. The true Church endureth nothing ſtrange; &amp; in the falſe Church euery thing is ſtrange. Remember what you read in the Prophet, of Tyrus: and make Ezech 27. 5. ſee Hierom vpon the place.

The inhabitants of Zidon, and Aruad were thy mariners, O Tyrus: thy wiſe-men that were in thee, they were the pilots, &amp;c. Euen ſo, ſo, in the falſe Church is euery thing ſtrange, and far fet. For if it come not from Rome, it is not for this Church, neither any account, or vſe made of it. Strange Doctrines in euery point of Religion, ſtrange Ceremonies neuer knowne, or vſed of the Apoſtles: beades and bables, infinite toyes and trickes of hallowed traſh too long to be repeated, all as ſtrange as euer was any thing in Tyrus. Wherfore, as the fal of Tyrus 
                        Ezech. 27. Apoc, 18. Marke. 6 47. was alſo ſtrange, ſo ſhal it be of this church in Gods time. This Ship in the Goſpell is ſaid to be troubled, and it noteth what the Church, and euery member thereof in this world is ſubiect vnto. The perils of the Ship are amplified by certaine Circumſtances there mentioned; as of time, yt it was night; of place, that it was in the Sea &amp; ye 
                        midſt of the Sea, of contrarie windes, and of Chriſts abſence, all occaſions of more trouble, and danger. For in the night there is darknes, the Rocks cannot be ſo well diſcerned; there is leſſe helpe, than on the day time; ſtormes and tempeſtes are vſually greater, and many other diſcommodities. In regard whereof the Poet Virgil could ſay,

                     This night naturall may reſemble vnto vs a double night, where in the Shippe of the Church is much indangered, the night of ignorance, and the night of ſinne. Either of them is a great darkeneſſe, and yet little thought of. No night ſo full of perill to a ſayling Shippe, as either of theſe to the militant Church. Of the firſt Saint Baſil complaineth to his Friend in his Epiſtle, ſaying, P. afil. Epist. 89. 
                        Eccleſia ſine Paſtoribus nauigatio in noote, pax nuſquam; Chriſtus dormit, quid non igitur timendum est?

                           The ſayling heere of the militant Church without Paſtors and Teachers, is a ſayling in the night, no light any where; Chriſt is a ſleepe, and what therefore is not to be feared?
                         Of the ſecond night (the night of ſinne) the Scripture euery where it ſelfe complaineth, ſhewing the diſtreſſe of the Church where ſuch darknes abideth.

                         Sée this night of the Church, which wee ſpeake of, and the danger of it.
                     The ſecond Circumſtance was of place, the ſhip was in the Sea, and in the midſt of the Sea, not néere any Hauen, farre from all helpe by land, and expoſed to the very full power of winde and water. A great Circumſtance of perill and danger, as we all knowe. And thus is the ſhip of the Church ſaid to be, when either hereſies or ſchiſmes abound in it, or cruell perſecution rageth againſt it. Of the 
                           Baſil. de Spiritu Sancto. ca. 30. firſt S. Baſil ſpeaketh, comparing the troubles of ye 
                        Church to the ſurges of the Sea, in which the ancient bounds of the Fathers are moued, euery foundation and ground of Doctrine ſhaken by Schiſmatickes and Heritickes, who are as the froth raiſed by thoſe waues and ſurges. To the ſecond we may referre thoſe raging furies of Nero Domitian, and the reſt, of whom Theodoret writeth thus, Quod illi crudelitatis genus in Christianos commenti non ſunt? an non manus pedeſ
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            abſciderunt? an non aures nareſ
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            obtruncaruut, &amp;c? What kinde of crueltie did not they deuiſe againſt the Chriſtians? Did not they cut off their hands &amp; feete, their eares and noſes, and iuuent all ſtraite bands to the height and extremitie of torment, &amp;c?
                         Thus wee ſée the Church in the midſt of the Sea, compaſſed about in this ſort with enemies domeſticall and forreigne. Domeſticall, heretickes and Schiſmatickes, who (as a generation of vipers) gnawe aſunder their Mothers belly. Forreigne, Pagans and Heathens, who cruelly and bloodily trouble the poore ſhip: by meanes whereof, ſometimes ſhe mounteth aloft, as a ſhip doth, being praiſed and commended greatlie; and ſometimes ſhee is throwne downe by reproches and contumelies of much contempt, being in caſe euen fitlie to ſay with the Poet,
                     
                     
                        Tollimur in coelum curuato gurgite; &amp; ijdem
                        Subducta ad manes imos deſcendimus vnda.
                     
                     Or rather, with the Pſalme, Wee are caried vp to the Heauens, and downe againe to the deepe. Our ſoule

melteth in vs, and wee are euen at deaths dore.
                     
                     
                        Another Circumſtance were contrarie windes, which vehemently did beate the ſhip, euen as ſtill and daily infinite croſſes doo the Church and members of it: as, when we are in health, and ſaile merrily, ſodainly commeth a contrarie winde of ſicknes, &amp; ſhaketh vs ſhrewdly. When we are rich, loſſes come; when we haue friends, they die; our good name is touched, our ſeruants deceaue vs, our children miſcarie or rebell againſt vs, and infinite are the contrarie windes that ariſe, and trouble this ſailing ſhip of ours in this worlde. The laſt (but not the leaſt) was Chriſtes abſence from them. For as ſoone as hee had ſent them away, ſaith the Goſpell, hee departed into a mountaine to pray. Let this informe vs how dangerous the abſence Mark. 6, 46. of the Paſtor is. When Moſes was abſent, the Iſraelites 
                        Exod. 32. 1. Math. 13. 25. fell to great and groſſe Idolatrie. Whileſt men ſleepe the enemie ſóweth tares. And what too much abſence of Paſtors hath done of euill in England, who can tell? Wee are preſent often in the time of profit, but abſent too often touching paines. The ſhippes therefore, ouer which the Lord hath appointed many of vs, are not onely troubled as this was; but almoſt euen ſunke and caſt away by contrarie windes of Romiſh charmes. Theſe are the perils of the ſhip. Now may we likewiſe in the ſame place of the Goſpell obſerue our duties in theſe perils. Laborant in remigando. 
                        Math. 14, 23. Mark. 6. 48. 
                        They tooke great paines in rowing; paines and paines together, with conſent and agréement: Two excellent thinges, and moſt worthie noting. Wee may not then caſt away hope in euery ſtorme, and commit the ſhip to the mercie of the Sea; for thus did not héere the Lords Diſciples: but we muſt rowe, and labour in rowing, and that ioyntlie all hands together; not ſome rowe, and ſome 
                           Baſilius vltro reconciliat Euſebio epiſcopo loci, ne Ariam ex eorum diſſidio praeualerent. Niceph. lib. 11. 18. ſléepe; not ſome rowe forward, and ſome backward; not ſome helpe, and ſome hinder; but all, I ſay againe, and all together, as Water-men lift together, and ſtrike together; and all one way, with one heart and will, ſéeking to ſaue

the ſhip againſt contrarie windes, waues and perils: for thus did the Diſciples héere. Princes and Prelates are theſe Rowers in the ſhip of this Church: and then euery one that hath any intereſt in his place, and for his place, muſt ſhewe his care and ioyne his helpe that all may be ſafe. For though the ſhip almoſt touched the ſhore, yet may ſhe quickly be driuen backe againe into the déepe, if this rowing ſlacke. Darius the Father of Xerxes was wont to ſay, that the warres made him wiſe, and ſurely ſo may the ſhips dangers make euery man more expert. But no man muſt faint and giue ouer in perill, for the end will be good, and ſuch fainting feare ſhould be very ſinfull. If I ſhould enter into particulars, ſurely much negligence might appeare: but I rather wiſh euery man to awake his owne heart; that whatſoeuer is paſt, yet hereafter it may be better, and if there be euer a ſléeping Ionas, awake him, and bid him call vpon his God. Thus doing, the end (I ſay) will be good. For marke nowe what followeth in the Goſpell. The Diſciples thus labouring painfully in rowing, the Lord Ieſus ſawe them, came vnto them, and all was well. Hee ſéeth all men and all matters, but a gracious eye hath hee euer to thoſe that are labouring in rowing according to their calling, which what a comfort it is, iudge you. And hee not onely ſeeth them, but commeth vnto them, ſaith, It is I, and maketh all thinges well. This is the happy victorie of the Church and euery member of the ſame at laſt, ouer all perilles and daungers, windes and waues, ſtormes and tempeſtes whatſoeuer. To this therefore caſt both eye and heart, and bee euer chéered in the aſſurance of it. The tempeſt is great, Acts. 5. but they rowe-on, and ouercome. There is a great billowe riſeth againſt Saint Paule, Acts. 13: euen Elimas the Sorcerer; but ſtrongly Paule rowed-on, and ouercame. Athanaſius and Hilarie againſt Arrius, Baſil againſt Eunomius, Tertullian againſt Hermogines, Origen againſt Celſus, Auguſtine againſt Fauſtus and Pelagius,

Scripturae remis Doctores aequora verrunt: With the oares of Gods holy word theſe Doctors ouercame all thoſe waues and windes. Post lachrimas riſus, post exilium Paradiſus, dixerunt Ʋeteres. After weeping comes laughing, and after baniſhment comes Paradiſe, ſaid our Elders. Caeſar bad the Mariner

                           bee of good comfort, becauſe hee caried him, ſo great a Monarch:
                         But howe much more may the ſhip wherein Chriſt is be comforted? When came Chriſt to them, ſaith the Text? Surely, not till the fourth watch of the night, that is, not till the Morning or daies dawning. For the night being deuided in to foure watches or parts, to wit, the beginning of the night, the midnight, the Cockes crowe about thrée of the clocke after midnight, and the dawning: This you ſée is laſt; ſo that all the night it pleaſed Chriſt to let them be troubled, and hee did not by and by come vnto them. Teaching thereby all his faithfull to be ſtrong and patient not yéelding to temptation, if in haſt the Lord come not with helpe, but ſtoutly &amp; ſtronglie wreſtling till hee come, leauing the tune to his owne good pleaſure, and comfortablie being aſſured that hee will come at laſt, as héere and euer hee did. Turbatur mare, fluctuabat nauicula: nauicula Eccleſia est, mare ſeculum: ſed venit Dominus &amp; ambulauit ſupra mare, &amp; preſſit fluctus ſpumantes &amp; magni (potestate ſcilicet) &amp; reges crediderunt Christo, &amp; ſubingati ſunt.

                           Aug. in Pſal. 92. in fine. 
                        (ſaith Saint Augustine) and the ſhippe is toſſed: the ſhip is the Church, and the Sea is the world; but the Lord came and walked vpon the Sea, and repreſſed all theſe ſmelling waues and billowes, to wit, the Kings and potentates of the earth beleeued in Chriſt, and were ſub dued to him. Who whilſt they raged againſt the poore ſhip, were ſo farre from ſinking her, (as they deſired to doo) Vt plané illis perſimiles inuenti ſint, &amp;c. That altogether
                         (ſaith Theodoret) they became like vnto thoſe, that ſeeking to

quench the flame, fondly poure oyle in, and ſo make it greater. And euen as the buſh that Moſes ſawe was not conſumed with fire: no more could the enemies with their warres and weapons ouerthrowe it. Simones, Marciones, Valentini, &amp;c. The Simoncans, the Marcionits, the Valentinians, and a number more (ſaith Greg. Nazianz.) they are all drowned in their owne déepes, and the Church is deliuered. Euer therefore, as the Iſraelites héere againſt Pharaoh and his heaſt; ſo ſhall Gods Church haue victorie againſt her enemies; but in Gods time, not at her owne will. Till then conſtant Faith and painfull rowing be graces becomming the Church and euery member of it. I am Ioſeph your brother, was a word of great comfort, you knowe, in the Figure; and It is I, it is I, be not afraide, is a farre greater comfort in Chriſt who was figured, blotting all feares whatſoeuer out of our hearts.
                     Laſtly, Thus Iſrael ſawe the mightie power, which 
                        ver 31. 
                        the Lord ſhewed vpon the Egyptians: ſo the people feared the Lord, and beleeued the Lord, and his ſeruant Moſes.
                         This is the end of Gods mercies to his Children, and of his iudgement vpon their foes, To encreaſe all good duties in them towards him: and (by name) a reuerend feare of his Maieſtie: and a faithfull aſſurance in his loue. They beléeued before in ſome meaſure, but now in a greater meaſure, as may bee ſaide of the Diſciples where the like Spéech is vſed, Iohn, 2. 11. They beleeued alſo his ſeruant Moſes, that is, they nowe plainly ſée that God was with him whom they ſo wickedly had abuſed. Let it profit vs to beware by them either to diſtruſt God, or to wrong his Miniſters appointed ouer vs, and let vs learne, that although Faith reſpect GOD onely, yet is there ſuch an vnion betwixt him and his Miniſters, as in déede and truth we cannot beléeue him, vnleſſe we alſo beléeue his Miniſters ſpeaking from him. And therefore whō God hath ioyned (euen in this ſenſe alſo) let no man ſeuer,

but beleeue the Lord, and his ſeruant Moſes. What is paſt of vnkindnes towards your faithfull Miniſter caring for you, praying for you, and wéeping for you when you are faſt on ſléepe in your bed, Let it grieue your heart in your ſecret chamber, and doo ſo no more; the Lord is with him, &amp; his ſervice is Gods mercie to you, the abuſe or contempt of him will ſo grieue the Lord, that you are ſure to féele his heauie hand for it. Be wiſe therefore, &amp; let both this particular and the whole Chapter profit you in Gods bleſſing.

We muſt learne alſo by this Example, euer after mercies and comforts to giue thanks. For the Cuſtome of the Church is the inſtruction of euery particular man and woman in the Church. The cuſtome wee ſée héere, and in other places. What Melchiſedech did after Abrahams victorie, wee reade in Geneſis.

                           Iudeths ſeruice and bleſſing with God is not forgotten: And, if you goe to Dauids Pſalmes, how many of them are Pſalmes of thankſgiuing after benefits? Of the cleanſed

                           Leapers though nine forget yet one is thankfull. The man healed of the palſie taketh vp his bed, &amp; praiſeth God. The Creeple healed entred into the Temple, walking, and leaping, and praiſing God. God and man abhorre the contrarie, and when thou art truly ſaid to be vnthankfull (but euen to man) there is in that one word all euill contained and affirmed of thée. Now, if priuate benefites ſhould be remembred, much more publique which touch ſo many. Whereforefor both, be euer thanksfull to God as the fountaine, and to man, as his meanes. Imperfection in this dutie beſéech him to pardon, &amp;c.
                        2. When was this thankſgiuing made? The Text telleth ver. 1. you in this word THEN, Then ſang Moſes &amp; the children of Iſrael. That is, euen preſently as ſoone as they could gather all their companie together on the other ſide of ye ſea, whither ſo happily they were brought on drie foote by a mighty God. In the 5, of Iudges you may note it alſo, THEN ſang Deborah &amp; Barak, euen the ſame day. And ſurely, to defer, it is alwaies dangerous, ſo ſoone are we cooled and become dull and heauie after the greateſt mercies. Doo it therefore whileſt thy heart is hot, &amp; thy féeling ſwéete of his fouour found. Doo it quickly &amp; hartily: and ſo thou moueſt the Lord to more mercy. For gratiarum actio est ad plus dandum inuitatio, Thankfulnes is an inuiting of God to giue more,
                            ſaith S. Ambroſe. Doo what wee can, wee ſhal be weake, and our beſt duties be full of wants: but yet ſpéede will helpe ſomewhat, and our care in making ſpéede ſhall finde mercie for ſuch wants. When dulneſſe crept in by careleſſe delay, ſhall be puniſhed.

And ſo euery one féeling, and euery one thanking, the Lord is praiſed of all, as his mercie and goodnes reach To all. A contrarie courſe it is, to truſt to other mens giuing of thanks for me, and to be dull and dumbe my ſelfe. Dauids words haue another touch, Thou art My God, and I, I will praiſe

Outward ſignes ſhall goe with inward truth: that both outwardly and inwardly I may doo my dutie. As I am glad that men ſée his goodnes to me; ſo thinke I it fit they ſhould alſo behold my dutie to him. I publiſh the one, I will not hide the other; I am glad of the one, and farre be it from me to be aſhamed of the other. Dauid ſpeaketh of the great Congregation, and, I will ſing in the middeſt of his people.

For hee hath triumphed gloriouſlie: the horſe and him that rode on him hath Hee ouerthrowne in the Sea: He, He, hath done this for me, for vs, &amp;c.

Thus for men to be a meanes to ſtirre vp women, and one woman to ſtirre vp another, Fathers to moue their Children, Mothers their Daughters, Maiſters their Seruants, and friends their friends, what a comfort is it where God graunteth it? Their Timbrels &amp; their daunces were according to the manner of thoſe parts, a graue and modeſt going in order with Songs and ſignes of ioy; no light nor wanton leaping, neither men and women together, as in the commaundement againſt Adulterie hath béene ſhewed.

THeſe thinges thus ended concerning the Thankes-giuing, from the Red-ſea they went into the Wildernes of Shur, and in three daies trauell they found no water, afterwards they found ſome, but it was ſo bitter they could not drinke it. A newe triall of their Faith and patience: and wee may well Note in it the courſe of the life of a childe of God in this world: euen to paſſe from triall to triall: and ſtill to be tried one way or other: That 
                           Acts. 14. 22. 
                           through many tribulations at length hee may enter into the Kingdome of God: and after many fights receaue that Crowne of righteouſnes, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, ſhall giue at that day, vnto all them that ſo haue finiſhed their courſe in Faith, and loue his appearing. In thoſe hote Countries the want of water is a greater affliction than elſe where: and yet great is the want of it any where. But when they had found it, to haue it ſo bitter, was croſſe vnto croſſe, making Moſes wordes true, God tooke vnto him a people by ſignes and wonders, by warre and might, by a ſtretched out arme, by great feare, and (nowe marke) BY TEMPTATIONS. Yet ſhould Deut. 4, 34. all haue béene endured patiently, hauing ſuch Tokens of

his care for them. But (alas) ſée what followeth.
                        2. Then the people murmured againſt Moſes, ſaying, 
                           ver, 24. 
                           what ſhall we drinke? Who would haue thought it poſſible ſo ſoone after ſuch a glorious Deliuerance for ſuch infirmitie to ſhew it ſelfe againe. But this is man both to God and his Miniſters: as ſoone as any contrarie winde bloweth againſt him. Truly therefore ſaide the Lord of vs, That our wickednes is great in the earth, and all the 
                           Gen. 6. 5. 
                           imaginations of the thoughts of our hearts onely euill continually. Let it ſtrike vs and humble vs, that no man thinke he is ſupported. For certainly this is our mold to murmure euer when we are diſpleaſed. Let the Mininiſter of God obſerue this Nature, and be prepared for the like in his people, if occaſion ſerue. Moſes was a great man, and full of all iuſt matter of high reuerence with his Flocke: yet we ſée how he is dealt with. As ſoone as any thing toucheth them, WHY? WHY? and WHAT? WHAT? ſtill flying vpō him with their venomed words of bitter impatiencie: and he muſt anſwere for all the trials it pleaſeth God to lay vpon his Church, or any member thereof. A fitter courſe it had béene for a people ſo taught with paſſed fauours, to haue aſſured themſelues of future helpes in Gods good time, and with patience and Faith to haue expected the ſame, aſſuring themſelues that he neuer had done ſo great things for them to giue them ouer in any néede. This is therefore their great fault: and let it profit vs neuer to offend ſo: But to looke vpon Dauid that good Patterne who reaſoned ſoundly and comfortably, That he which had deliuered him from the Beare and the Lyon, would alſo ſaue him from that vncircumciſed Philiſtime: to looke alſo vpon S. Paule, who maketh 2. Cor. 1. 10. the ſame Argument, that God did deliuer him, doth deliuer him, and héereafter will deliuer him aſſuredly. This, this is the right way, To remember how many baskets full of broken meate were taken vp: and neuer to feare any want where ſuch a powerfull God is. To remember

what God hath done for mee, and to make that an argument both of my prayer and hope, as Dauid doth when he ſaith, Thou haſt ſet me at liberty when I was in trouble: 
                           Pſal. 4. 1. 
                           haue mercie vpon me and helpe me. As for murmurings and repinings, faintings &amp; fearings, they offend God, they grieue his Miniſter, they ſhame our ſelues, they offend the Church, and no way can they profit vs, be they neuer ſo violent &amp; bitter. Bleſſed Iobs Spéech therefore is a bleſſed practiſe for euery good man &amp; woman, If the Lord ſhould 
                           Iob. 13 15.

                        3. What doth poore Moſes thus grieued againe with a peruerſe People? ſurely againe he runneth to his God and crieth to him. And this ſtill is the refuge of the poore ver. 25. Miniſter, and of all thoſe that feare him. Uſe it and kéepe it, God is not as man, to be wearie; and thou ſhalt finde the fruite of it, as Moſes did againe in this place. For vpon this his crying the Lord ſhewed him a Tree, which when hee had caſt into the waters they were ſweete: and the people dranke of them, with great contentment to their fill. Hath not GOD then an iſſue for euery temptation, if wee would expect it? Are not the Cries of his Seruants heard? and doo not they crie to him when others murmure againſt him? Marke all theſe things with your ſelfe, and be the better; for I paſſe them ouer with this pointing at them. And for this tree, which being caſt into the waters made them ſweete, take it for a moſt Excellent Figure of Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour, by whom all bitter affliction is made ſweete: and the ſowre curſe of the Lawe condemning all men without him, quite and cleane taken away. For who is able either to endure the croſſe or to taſte of the Lawe without Chriſt; yet in him, and by him both are ſweete, affliction fitting vs to Gods Kingdome, and the Lawe teaching vs what to doo, and what to flie.

the hidden bitternes which lay in the hearts of theſe Murmurers; and thinke with your ſelfe, that euen ſo doth bitter aduerſitie in many men and women at this day, diſcloſe ſecrets, and ſhewe them to haue weakenes, before not knowne, or thought of. Secondly, Note howe in trauelling to the Land of Canaan, wee muſt aſſuredly paſſe by Marah, and there wee muſt make a pitching place for a time, till it ſhall pleaſe God to graunt a Remoue. Bitter, bitter, and very bitter will the waters prooue: but murmure we not as theſe men did: for hee that was ſo gracious as to make them ſweete to ſuch Repiners, what will he doo in his good time to vs, if we patiently abide his will: ſurely he will much more reſpect vs, and euen boaſt of our patience to our eternall good; as he did of his ſeruant Iobs righteouſnes. But now for the tree; ſome aſke, whether there were any ſuch vertue in it by Nature to ſwéeten waters? and if there were, what néede God had to vſe any ſuch meanes, ſéeing with his onely word hee could haue helped them? for anſwere whereunto, it may firſt be ſaide concerning the firſt, that the Lord hath giuen moſt excellent vertues to his creatures, beaſtes, hearbes, plants, ſtones, trées, and ſuch like, thereby to ſhewe his mightie

As for beaſts, their blood, their fleſh, their fat, &amp;c, what vertues are in them? for hearbs, ſome comfort and helpe the braine, ſome the eyes, ſome the liuer, ſome the heart, ſome one part, ſome another, with moſt rare and ſouereigne qualities giuen them of GOD for this end. The conſideration whereof hath greatly delighted many worthy perſons, and cauſed them both to ſpeake and write of them with great pleaſure, Methridates that great King of Pontus, and of one and twentie Kingdomes more, for his wonderfull ſkill in hearbes, and his ſouereigne remedie againſt poyſon and contagious diſeaſes, called after his name Methridate, is become in all Bookes and Monuments of learning, renowned and famous. Lyſimachus Eupator King of Ilyricum,
                           
is ſaid to haue béene moſt ſkilfull in hearbs. Artemiſia the wife of Mauſolus King of Caria, was an excellent Lady for knowledge in hearbes. Marcus Valerius Coruinus, a worthie Romane was ſo delighted with the ſtudie of hearbs, that he withdrewe himſelfe into ye Countrie where he might wholely (as it were) dwell in his Garden. But what ſpeake I of theſe, ſince we all knowe what is written of Salomon? namely, how he wrote of all Trees from the Cedar which is in Libanon, vnto the Hyſſop which ſpringeth out of the wall, that is, from the higheſt to the loweſt: hee wrote of plants and hearbes, beſides of beaſts, fowles, creeping things and fiſhes, worthie Bookes no doubt, if it had pleaſed God to let them continue to this day. The ſtrange vertues of precious ſtones diuers likewiſe Franciſcus Rueus. haue written, whom both with pleaſure and profit we may reade. Concerning all which happie qualities 
                              Zanch de operibus Dei, &amp;c. vouchſafed to theſe Creatures, and euen particularly of this wood we now ſpeake of, remember with your ſelfe that Notable Teſtimonie of Ieſus the ſonne of Syrach in his Booke. The Lord, ſaith he, hath created medicines of 
                           Eccleſ. 38. 4. 
                           the earth, and he that is wiſe, will not abhorre them. Was not the water made ſweete with wood, that men might 
                           5. 6. 
                           knowe the vertue thereof? So he hath giuen men knowledge, that he might be glorified in his wondrous works. With ſuch doth he heale men, &amp; taketh away their paines. 
                           7. 8. Why God vſeth meanes. 
                           Of ſuch doeth the Apothecarie make a confection, &amp;c. Such vertue therefore was in ye 
                           wood giuen to it by God, who is the God of Nature, and giueth all theſe things. To the ſecond (why God ſhould vſe ſuch meanes, being able with his word to ſwéeten them?) true Anſwere may bee made, that although God be able to doo all things by himſelfe, yet chooſeth hee often to worke by meanes, and that for our good. As firſt, that ſo he might teach vs his Souereigne power ouer all Creatures vſing them at his pleaſure, when, and how, he ſhall beſt like, and draw vs to the true reuerence &amp; worſhip of him as Creator, Ruler, Lord,

and Gouernour of all the creatures. Secondly, that hee might manifeſt by this meanes his loue and goodnes to vs much more, when he maketh all his creatures ſerue to our health, comfort, and good, and ſo drawe and ſtir vs vp to true thankfulnes vnto him for it. Thirdly, that he might teach vs thus not to abuſe thoſe his creatures, which with ſo excellent vertues and qualities are created for vs, to doo vs good. Fourthly, that we might learne by this meanes, not to contemne ſecond Cauſes and meanes, by abuſing (through a vaine preſumption) the holy Doctrine of his prouidence. For, when God himſelfe is pleaſed to vſe theſe inſtrumentes, who are wee that wee ſhoulde reiect them? and if we doo, what doo we contemne and reiect, but his Ordinance? Lewd and wicked therefore are the Anabaptiſts: who, as of the ſoule, ſo of the body, caſt away the meanes of health: and yet ſay, they deſire the health of both. S. Auguſtines words I cannot paſſe ouer, (fit for them, and fit for vs in this matter) in his whole 29. Chapter of the 7. Booke of the Citie of GOD, ſhewing howe God vſeth ſecond cauſes in the gouernment of the Of ſecond cauſes. world, becauſe he hath created them to that purpoſe. Yet euer he doth not tie himſelf to theſe things, but ſometimes without them, and euen contrarie to them, hee worketh his will alſo: that thereby wee might learne, his vſing of them to be without néede, ſéeing hee can worke without them, if he pleaſe. Secondly, that when hee vſeth them, it is he that worketh by them, and not they without him; as he giueth light in the Sun, he féedeth vs in our meate, &amp;c. For if without them it be he, much more in them and by them it is he. Thirdly, that wee might ſée how many waies he is able to helpe vs, when any thing is wanting vnto vs which is néedefull. And this we may well thinke was the cauſe héere, why it pleaſed GOD to ſhewe this Tree, that they might be aſhamed of their impatiencie and miſtruſt, neuer more ſo ſinning againe; ſéeing (by one meanes, or other) there is with him euer ſo readie &amp; eaſie

helpe. Yea this is the cauſe alſo why (euen contrary to Nature) he worketh often; that neither to Nature we ſhould tie him, deſpairing of health, wealth, or liberty when we ſée no means, or meanes (in reaſon) working to the contrary; foraſmuch as he is ſtall about all, and can with meanes, &amp; without meanes, agréeably to Nature, &amp; contrary to Nature, giue his Name praiſe, and his children comfort in a moment. Profit wee therefore thus by this Tree ſhewed to Moſes in extremity to make the waters ſweere withall.

                           and there he prouoked them, and ſaid, If thou wilt diligently hearken, O Iſrael, vnto the voice of the Lord thy GOD, and wilt doo that, which is right in his fight, and wilt giue eare vnto his Commaundements, and keepe all his Ordinances; then will I put none of theſe diſeaſes vpon thee, which I brought vpon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord that healeth thee. Where the Lord tryed them by want of water, there he alſo admoniſhed them by his Word, declaring vnto them their inſt deſeruing of ſuch Plagues and diſeaſes as were inflicted vpon the Egyptians: from which they had béene frée hitherto, onely by his frée mercy and goodneſſe; and acquainting them that ye only way for them ſo to continue ſtill, was to hearken to his Will, and to obey the ſame; otherwiſe he being the only Author of health, it could not be ſo with them.

vpon all which the Holy-Ghoſt ſetteth a brand of diſlike: and ſo by their ſinne admoniſheth vs to beware. Miriam murmureth againſt her brother Moſes the Lords faithfull Num. 12. 1. 10 Seruant; and how fearefully was ſhe ſmitten with a Leproſie? Let this ſinite the heart of euery Chriſtian Reader, and make him conſider what may quickly happen to himſelfe, if hée bée a murmurer. From the Old Teſtament come to the New, and obſerue as much. The Pharaſies murmure at Chriſt his mercy to poore Publicans: there is murmuring for good done on the Sabbath day: For not waſhing before meate: that ſuch as came late had a penny as wel as thoſe that had borne the heate of the day: that the ointment was powred vpon Chriſt, and not rather ſold, and giuen to the poore: that the Widowes were neglected: and that Mary doth not helpe Martha, but ſit and heare Chriſts words. But ſtill obſerue how all theſe were ſinfull and grieuous to God; and what a diligent record is made of them and of the ſeuerall cauſes; that wee might learne and ſee no cauſe to warrant this lewde behauiour.

                            And the words of Plato are as fit of vnbridled mouths ſendingout iniury both to Heauen and Earth. The end of which mouthes Euripides by the light he had, could well diſcern, that it would be miſery and woe, as indeede it will, trye who liſt. Circumſtances increaſe this ſinne very much; as Who numbreth? againſt whom? and in what matter? who murmureth? A ſubiect, a ſonne, a friende, to whom much fauour many waies hath béene ſhewed; A profeſſor of the Goſpell, well acquainted with the Word, and vpon whom many eies are caſt &amp;c. Againſt whom? Againſt Prince, againſt Parents, againſt Friends, to whom obedience, duty, and loue with al the Teſtimonies therof are due, and moſt due; againſt God, whoſe Word is in our hands, &amp; in our mouthes, and whoſe ſeruants wée would gladly bée eſtéemed. In what matter? In a ſmall matter, in a trifle; and wherein, or for what, we ought rather giue thankes, in a matter lawfull, tollerable, good, and no way to bée grudged at. Theſe and ſuch like Circumſtances I ſay make the fault much fouler and greater. Old Writers haue vttered theſe kinds in theſe wordes, Eſt murmuratio contra Deum per diſplicentiam, contra Praelatumper inobedientiam, &amp; contra proximū per inuidentiam. There is a murmuring againſt God by diſcontentment, againſt our ſuperior by diſobediēce, &amp; againſt our Neighbour by enuie.
                            But from what fountaine floweth al this filthy water which ſo offendeth God, ſo grieueth man, and ſo infecteth the very aire? Surely either from impatience, or from pride, both bad and very bad fountaines. Of the firſt that was an example in the Acts of the Apoſtles about the Widowes of the Graecians: For not able with patience Acts. 6. 1. to endure their conceited griefe, till there might bée declaration made thereof, and order taken accordingly, they fell to ſecret carping and biting vnfit for the profeſſors

of the Worde: and in that heat touched euen the Apoſtles themſelues with want of care. Of the later, that is a moſt fearefull example in Numbers of proude Corah and his company, whoſe pride, enuie &amp; ambition brought them to ſo ſtrange and dreadfull a death. They grieued that Moſes ſhould haue ſuch authority, they thought them ſelues worthy of ſome of it, and what they thought fit, not what pleaſed him, God muſt doo. Of which kinde of Murmurers and enuiers Saint Gregorie hath a good ſaying in his Morales, Qui contra ſuprapoſitam ſibi poteſtatem murmurat, liquet, qúoa

And vpon the ſeuenth Pſalme, murmurantes dicuntur intrare in iudicium cum Deo: Murmumurers are ſaide to enter into indgment with GOD: They are like, ſaith An other to a filthy ſooyne, who whether hee wake or ſleepe is euer grunting.

And ſée howe far this is from murmuring and grudging. Optimumest pati quod emendare non potes, &amp; Deum, quo authore cunctaproueniunt, ſine murmuratione comitari, It is beſt,
                            ſaith Seneca, to ſuffer what thou canſt not amend, and to follow God (from whom, as from a fountaine, all things doo come) without murmuring. Malus est miles qui imperatorem ſequitur gemens, He is a very bad Souldier that followeth his General with grumbling. And certainly he is as bad a Chriſtian, that controuleth God in

his works; and thinketh this, or that, might bee better. Some will haue faire weather, and ſome will haue foule; ſome wet and ſome drie; ſome dearth, and ſome plentie: who can repeate mens vaine conceites héerein, neuer caring for others, but for themſelues: and therein alſo mightily deceaued, becauſe man indéede is not able to comprehend, what will euer bee beſt for him. Holcot vpon the Booke of Wiſedome telleth a Tale of an Heremit, that hauing Lect. 9. ſowed pot-hearbs in his Garden, deſired faire weather, and foule weather as hee iudged to be beſt for his hearbs, and ſo had ſtill graunted of God according to his requeſt, but not one hearb came vp: whereupon he thought, there was a generall failing in all places of ſuch hearbs, till on a time walking to another Heremit not far off, hee ſaw with him a very excellent crop: Then hee tolde him what he had begged, and obtained, touching the weather, and what effect it had. Whereunto the other Heremit anſwered, Putahas te ſapientiorem Deo, &amp; ipſe estendit tibi fatuitatem tuam, &amp;c. Thou diddeſt thinke thy ſelfe wiſer than God, and hee hath ſhewed thee thy folly.
                            I for my crop neuer aſked any other weather than GOD ſhould pleaſe to ſend. I would this olde Heremit might teach many in our daies to be leſſe wiſe in their owne conceites, concerning both weather, and other matters: and to relie more vpon Gods mercifull prouidence and bottomleſſe wiſedome, that hee both knoweth what is beſt for mans vſe, and will accordingly (for his owne goodnes) vouchſafe the ſame. Then would there not be ſo many faithleſſe feares and doubts amongſt vs as are, much leſſe any opening of our mouthes againſt Heauen, as, I feare, is. But let ſuch remember what Seneca writeth of Caeſar, who hauing appointed a great Feaſt for his Nobles and friends of all degrées, and it falling out that the day was ſo extreame foule as nothing could be done, being highly diſpleaſed at it, in extreame madneſſe willed all them that had bowes to ſhoote vp their arrowes at Iupiter in defiance

of him, for that foule weather. Which when they accordingly did, their arrowes lighting ſhort of Heauen, fell downe vpon their owne heads, and hurt a number of them very ſore. Euen ſo doo our muttering and murmuring words, either for this or that which God ſendeth, not hurt him but wound our ſelues both déepely, and dangerouſly. Another deſire of men is, 
                              •
                           uer to be in proſperitie, and not to taſte of any aduerſitie; if they doo, then they murmure, and then they grudge, ſaying, or thinking the Lord dealeth hardly. But theſe men forget that if the Phyſition deſire a mans life and health, he reſtraineth him of many things wiſhed and longed for, and miniſtreth manie things vnto him bitter and vnpleaſant; whereas, if he deſpaire of the parties well doing, hee ſuffereth him to eate and drink what he will. They forget that thoſe Cattle which the Graſier putteth into his beſt Paſtures and féedeth fat, are vſually appointed to the ſlaughter. They forget that too much ranckneſſe hurteth the corne, and too much fruite breaketh the trées. They forget that Chriſt gaue both a ſop and a dipped ſop to Iudas, and yet he was a reprobate; the reſt (being choſen veſſels) had no ſuch thing. A whirle winde caried Elias to Heauen, &amp; ſo hath affliction many an one. But the Rich Glutton that had all pleaſure in his life time, loſt his pleaſure, and gayned woe for euer. It is not good to haue our wages too ſoone, but to remember chéerefully, that when the day is ended, then wages will be paid. He that trauelleth in the way againſt the Sunne, hath the light before him, and the ſhadowe behind him: ſo haue the wicked proſperitie &amp; comfort heere, none hereafter. But hee that trauelleth with the Sunne hath the ſhadowe before him, and the light after him: ſo haue the godly croſſes heere and eternall ioy after. Murmure not therefore at any wants, neither gréeue if other: be made rich, and the glory of their houſes encreaſed: for as thy ſhadowe goeth before, ſo will thy light followe: And as his light is before, ſo will his ſhadowe follow moſt

aſſuredly. Nothing ſhall he carie with him when he dieth, neither ſhall his pompe followe him. Qui honoratur in via, in peruentione

For certainely as your ſelfe would be more carefull of a childe of yours that you had done little or nothing for, than of one that was prouided for, and had plenty: ſo is the Lord of Heauen (that kinde Father aboue all Fathers) moſt carefull of their good, who héere in this life haue had leaſt, and are indéede yet vnprouided for. O beléeue it, they ſhall haue a day, and that a ſwéete day and a ioyfull.

                           God is departed, is not pietie, ſaith S. Auguſtine. Fooliſh men ſpeake fooliſhly, but our ſpéech ſhould be with a graine of ſalt. S. Auguſtine noteth it very well, that S. Iames doth not ſay None can tame, but no man can tame the tongue, that when it is tamed, wee might knowe it to be a worke of God, and not of man. It is walled in wich two walls, the lips and the teeth, to note a double triall that ſhould be taken of our words before we ſpeake. Firſt, whether it be lawfull; ſecondly, whether it be expedient that we meane to ſay. And if both theſe, then ſpeake on and ſpare not, all ſhall bee well. But if either of theſe want, then kéepe the doore faſt, and let not that little member haue his will. The good Abbot ſawe both the good, and the difficultie of this, who being vnlearned, and very deſirous to be inſtructed, when hee was come to that verſe of the Pſalme (I ſaide I will looke to my waies, that I offend not in my tongue) bad Stay there, till hee had learned that leſſon, which he feared would be both hard, and long.

                            Thus much of this matter of Murmuring, if not too much, of purpoſe enlarged, becauſe the fault is too generall

both in perſons murmuring, and in matters murmured at.
                        
                        4. But did they all murmure without exception? No: but although yt 
                           Text make no exception, yet we may ſafely think, the Lord had his number among them that did not murmure at all. Yet foraſmuch as this number was very ſmall in compariſon of the Murmurers, therefore there is no mention made of it, but all in generall are ſaid to murmure. And indéede what are the godly but as wheat hid vnder a great heape of chaffe, which doth not appeare ſo well, till the chaffe be wynowed &amp; blowne away? It was ſufficient that the Lord well diſcerned both, &amp;c.
                        5. The words of their Murmuring are expreſſed in the 3. verſe, Oh (ſay they) that we had died by the hand of the Lord in the Land of Egypt, when wee fate by the fleſh-pots, when wee ate bread our bellies full! for yee haue brought vs into the Wildernes to kill this whole companie with famine. Words of ſuch impietie, as I knowe not how to begin to ſpeake of them. O impiam et nefandam vocem! O wicked and horrible words!
                            (ſaith a godly Interpreter) O ſinfull and curſed ſpeech! may all that reade it, and taſte of GOD ſay; eſpecially in this people ſo acquainted with Gods mercy, grace, and power, ſo made famous ouer the world with miracles wrought for them againſt their enemies. For, what is this which they ſay? but all one as if they had ſaide; wee care not for our Deliuerance out of Egypt, and from all the bondage and crueltie againſt vs and our Children, wee giue GOD no thankes for it, for wee were better ſo, than thus; O, that hee had let vs alone by the fleſh-pots, and come to deliuer vs when wee had ſent for him. Such height of vnthankfull contempt who trembleth not to reade, and ſhaketh not to thinke of in his heart? But let it profit vs; for to that ende the Lord hath Chronicled it in his Booke. Firſt then, let it teache vs and tell vs, yea ſoundlie ſettle in vs, howe quicklie theſe ſinfull hearts of ours ſlippe from their duties, if once anie croſſe

lay holde on vs, making thoſe mercies and benefits of God vile, and of no account, which at the firſt when we receaued them were moſt great in our eyes, moſt welcome and acceptable; we then ſaying, O, how ſhould we thanke the Lord enough for theſe thinges! But is this well? Doth the word teach vs thus? or doo wee our ſelues endure this meaſure to be meaſured to vs by thoſe to whom we haue béene good and kinde vnto? No, no: And therefore abhorre it as moſt odious both to God and man: and looke wee at the Rule which teacheth vs otherwiſe. Great were the fauours that Iob had receaued from his God: aduerſitie commeth, and that (as you know) in a great degrée. Doth Iob vilifie therefore either in tongue or heart thoſe former fauours, and ſay, O, that God had neuer beſtowed them on me? No, you know, but holily and vertuouſly he embraceth Gods will, and telleth his repining wife, That ſince they had in former times receaued good things from God, ſhould not they alſo receaue euill, when it was his pleaſure? Yes, yes: And therefore ſaith hee, The Lord gaue, and the Lord hath taken: and bleſſed, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord euen in taking, as well as giuing, and euer for all thinges that he doth. The Apoſtles of Chriſt were exalted by him to the higheſt dignitie in his Church, it was no doubt a great grace vnto them and very acceptable, but afterward cōmeth perſecution, impriſonment, whipping, and many croſſes; Doo they then ſay as theſe Iſraelites, (O, that wee had died by the hand of the Lord! O, that wee had neuer beene Apoſtles!) and ſo caſt the mercies of God in his face for the troubles which followed ſuch fauour? Not ſo, you ſée, but they went away reioycing, that they were made worthy to ſuffer thoſe 
                           Acts, 5. 41. 
                           things for ſo kinde a Lord as had exalted them to that dignitie, and giuen vnto them ſuch graces and places as then they had. Let vs looke vpon ſuch Examples as theſe, and pray to God for ſtrength to followe them. Let vs often remember that good Counſaile of the wiſe man, My ſonne,

if thou wilt come into the ſeruice of GOD, ſtand faſt in 
                           Sirach. 2. 1.

                           and ſhrinke not away when thou art aſſailed; but waite vpon God patiently. Ioyne thy ſelfe vnto him, and depart not away, that thou maiſt be encreaſed at the laſt 
                           4.

                           gold and ſiluer are tried in the fire, euen ſo are men acceptable in the fornace of aduerſitie. And ſo forth much more; if you will, reade the Place your ſelfe. Forget not what the Apoſtles in the Acts did, and ſaid; Who confirmed the 
                           Acts. 14. 22. 
                           Diſciples hearts, and exhorted them to continue in the faith; affirming that wee muſt through many afflictions enter into the Kingdome of God. There are many ſuch places in Scripture. Away then with thoſe crooked wayes Math. 16. 23, 2. Tim. 3, 12. wherein too many doo walke: and be taught by theſe Examples what euer to doo. The Goſpel is welcome to manie at the firſt, and they greatly reioyce in it; but when either trouble groweth for it, or they are reſtrained by it from their accuſtomed ſinnes of ſwearing, drunkennes, ſenſualitie, couetouſnes, oppreſſion, vſurie, and ſuch like, then they wiſh they had neuer béene troubled with ſuch preaching, and all Gods mercie is returned to him with great vnthankfulnes, as héere it was of theſe murmuring Iſraelites. If authoritie and offices either in Church or Cōmon-wealth be giuen in Gods goodnes to ſome men, they receaue them ioyfullie, and ſay they are much bound to God for them: But when ſuch things happen as vſuallie followe ſuch places, to wit, trouble and charge, lies and ſlaunders, contumelies and reproaches, with great vnthankfulnes then they turne both tongues and hearts, and wiſh they neuer had béene ſo graced. For Matches and mariages, O, what impietie is in many, many times! curſing the parties, and almoſt curſing God that gaue them

                           ſuch a match: when yet at the beginning all was well, and euerybody pleaſed. Let all theſe and all others faulty in like ſort looke vpon theſe murmuring Iſraelites, and be aſhamed of ſuch ſinne. For man and wife, let them conſider but one thing which GOD hath giuen them in their owne bodies, and ſée how it will inſtruct them. Their two eyes if they goe together and looke both one way, be it vpward or downward, to the right hand or to the left, All is well and comely in the face. But if they bée ſeuered and the one eye looke one way, and the other an other, there is a blemiſh wée all confeſſe, and it is not well: So man and Wife who as the two eies are made to looke one way, ſhould neuer bee ſeuered to goe a ſunder, to croſſe one an other, to reproach one an other, to ſhame one an other, to breake-vp houſe and depart one from another. Surely the blemiſh is great, and as many as care either for piety or honeſtie, will conſider of it. Secondly, theſe words of the Iſraelites may ſhew vs what is the courſe of too many Men and Women in the world another way, euen to pre

                           er the fleſh-pots of Egypt before the Land of Canaan, and bellies full of bread before a bleſſed deliuerance out of cruell bondage, that is, Earth before Heauen, and the ioyes of this world before all that can bee giuen when this life is ended. A miſerable and monſtrous blindneſſe, yet ſuch as no perſwaſion will preuaile againſt, it is ſo ſetled and rooted in ſinfull hearts. Remember what you reade in the 11. of Iohn, when Chriſt had raiſed vp Lazarus to life againe, And many that had ſeen theſe things beleeued on 
                           Ioh. 11 44. 45. 47. 48 
                           him: Then gathered the high Prieſts a Councill, and ſaid, what ſhall we doe? If we let this man thus alone, all men wil beleeue in him (now marke) and the Romanes will come &amp; take away both our Place, and Nation. So before Chriſt they preferre their places, and for the world adieu to Heauen. Such others were thoſe in the Prophet Ieremy, who meaſured Religion by plenty and ſcarcitie, iudging that beſt which brought moſt profit, and that

worſt wherein there was any want. The word which thou haſt ſpoken (ſay they) to vs in the Name of the Lord, we will not heare of thee, But we will doo whatſoeuer

For then had we plentie of victualles and were well, and felt no euill. But

                           ſince we left off to burne incenſe to the Queene of Heauen and to poure out drinke offerings vnto her, wee haue had ſcarſeneſſe of all things, and haue beene conſumed by the ſword and by famine. But if you reade the reſt of the Chapter, you ſhall ſee that their Plagues grew becauſe they ſinned againſt the Lord, and would not be ruled by his Word, to worſhip him, and him onely, according to his Word. Such Arguments made the Heathen againſt the Chriſtians in former times, as witneſſeth Tertullian, Cyprian, and others; attributing all 
                              Tertul. Apologet. 51. Si Tybris exundat, ſi grando, ſi gelu. &amp;c. Cypr. ad Demetrianum. calamities (that happened) to the Chriſtians: becauſe that they worſhipped not the Idols of the Heathens: but they anſwered euen as Ieremy, that ſuch calamitles fell, becauſe they (the Heathens) would not forſake their Idols, &amp; embrace Gods true Religion, &amp; ſo indéede they did. Such words, and euen the very ſelfe ſame words, vſe the Papiſts againſt vs, and the Goſpell at this day: telling vs often and too often (vnleſſe it were truer) how great plenty was in former times when Popery ſwaied, how many egges forſooth for a penny, and all this geare; grounding an argument thereupon, that therefore that was truth, and this is falſhood, euen as Heatheniſh and Iewiſh Idolaters did before them. But with Ieremy and the godly Fathers we truely inuert their argument vpon them: that their contempt of truth, and foule Idolatry in deſpite of truth prouoketh God to many croſſes, and will yet prouoke him further if they continnue without amendment. And touching their pretended plenty when Popery ruled,

we ſay it is a Tale, for as great dearth was then as ſince. Touching our owne country of which I chiefely ſpeake, let them remember what our Chronicles note in Richard the firſt his time, how ſharpe a ſcarcity there was by the ſpace of thrée or foure yeares. What a Sommer that was in Edward the 3. his time, called the deere Sommer. In Richard the 2. his time what a dearth, when the people wereforced ſo to féede vpon fruite to ſuſteine Nature, as that thereby many fell into fluxes, and dyed. How the childrens cries were ſo pitifull for the want of foode which their Parents had not to giue them, as a ſtonie heart could not indure to heare. Of Henry the ſixth his time, when people were forced to make bread of Fearne rootes. And (to go no further) of Acrone bread in Quéene Maries time. Were there now ſo many egges a penny, and all cheape, cheap? Yet Poperie ſwaied in blinded hearts too much. No, no, The calamities which haue béene in places where this Ignorance ruled, haue béene equall or greater than vnder the Goſpell, euer, as all Stories tel vs. Hath Rome it ſelfe neuer béene affected? hath the Pope himſelfe neuer béene taken priſoner? Haue Romiſh warres euerproſpered, or Popiſh conſpiracies had their wiſhed effects? Bleſſed be the God of Heauen for it, they know the contrary. And that Spaniſh, Romiſh, and Diueliſh attempt in the yéere 1588 yeildeth them matter of wiſdome, (if God ſo pleaſe,) and vs eternall cauſe of thankſ-giuing vnto God for it. Euer praiſed from our heart roots be the glorious Name of him that ſo reſpected vs. But yet this is not the matter; for if they had euer had plenty, and euer ſcarcity, true Religion is not meaſured by the belly, by fleſh-pots or great leaues, or any outward proſperity or aduerſity, but by the Rule which God hath left vs in his holy Scriptures; Therefore although wee could obiect Eſay. 8. 20. vnto them the vnſpeakeable bleſſings of God vpon this Land of ours, and thereupon reaſon as Gamaliel did; yet doo wee not: but throwing our ſelues downe

at his féete, who gaue them all, wée reſt our ſelues vpon his Word: and ſo both know truth, and hate error, as in mercie he enableth, leauing fleſh-pots and all fleſhly reaſons to ſuch doughtie diſputers as they are, that ſtand vpon ſuch arguments: and to ſtrengthen our hearts againſt this great ſinne héere noted in the Iſraelites, Weelooke vpon Demas; whoſe ſhame liueth in Gods Booke for imbracing

Wée thinke vpon that fearefull crie, One drop of water to coole my tongue: When all the pleaſures of the world which eyther he had, or we can haue, coulde not helpe. And as Elias couered his face with his mantle, ſo do we hide our eies from beholding this world and the deceipts thereof. Wée aſſure our ſelues Saint Hierom ſaid true: Difficile, immo impoſſibile eſt, vt praeſentibus quis &amp; futuris fruatur bonis, vt his ventrem ibi mentem impleat, vt de delitijs tranſeat ad delitias, vt invtroque ſeculo primus ſit, vt &amp; in coelo &amp; in terra appareat glorioſus. It is hard, yea it is impoſſible that one ſhould enioy both preſent and future good things, that heere he ſhould fill his belly, and there his minde; that from pleaſure he ſhould paſſe to pleaſure, that in both worldes he ſhould be chiefe, and both in earth and heauen appeare glorious.
                            So wee leaue the fleſhpots of Aegypt to all earthly Iſraelites, and beſéech the Lord to bring vs to his kingdome, although it be through many tribulations.

For how can the ſighes of a groaning heart ſorrowing for ſinne bée neglected of ſo ſwéet a God, when ſuch proud offendours finde

mercie? neuer, neuer can it be, aſſure your ſelfe. Therefore lay vp this place in your minde, and féeling your ſelfe grieued either for things committed, or omitted, bée not too much ſhaken as one out of hope, but with faithfull aſſurance ſay chéerefully, O kinde Father, and ſweete GOD, doo not caſt away thy creature, that crieth, and flieth vnto thy mercy. I am vnworthy full wel I know it, but thy goodneſſe hath no bottome, and with ioye I remember it; Theſe murmurers and complainers againſt thy mercies thou yet ſhewedſt more mercie vnto, and thy poore ſeruant ſuing for grace wilt thou cleane reiect? No deare father thy nature is not ſo, and therefore by this fauour to thē, I gather cōfort: &amp; beſeech thee to be as thou haſt euer been, my kinde, my gratious and louing Lord.

It is moſt true, and it is moſt comfortable, leauing no cauſe why wée ſhould in any diſtreſſe be caſt downe too much, ſeeing the Lord is not tyed to ordinarie meanes, nor our maintenance to the fruites of the earth.

Lift vp your thoughts therefore aboue the courſe of Nature when you thinke vpon GOD: and although you haue neither bread nor money, nor the whole land any corne; yet paſt hope take hold on hope take hold on hope: and leaue God to himſelfe.

8 But why did not God thus comfort his people before they murmurd? Surely becauſe he might open vnto them the hidden corruption of their nature, and ſo make them ſée, &amp; all poſterity alſo, that not merit in them, but mercy in him drew all the fauoures that were ſhewed to them. And remember euer this vſe of affliction, how it is often ſent of God to diſcouer vs, not vnto him who knoweth vs well, but to our ſelues who dote vpon our worth, and thinke wée are farre otherwiſe than wee are; yea, and to the worlde alſo, which many times is deceaued by our golden ſhew. Stand wée therefore alwaies vpon our watch, when the croſſe knocketh at our doores, and know there is a ſpic ētered &amp; a very tel-tale. He wil looke into vs, draw-out frō vs what is within; our faire looks ſhal not deceiue him: but as we are he wil make vs ſhew, yt we may be knowne.

They that would haue it naturall, tell vs of the Manna of Arabia, which is ſould in our Apothecaries ſhoppes, and ſay that out of the earth there iſſueth and commeth dulcis halitus, a certaine ſweet vapoure,
                            which béeing drawne vp by the heate of the Sunne, is purged from his groſſe earthlineſſe, and made more pure and ſwéete, then with the cold of the night is hardened, and before Morning falleth downe againe vpon the earth like dew or the hoare froſt, and ſo is gathered dried and kept as medecineable for mans bodie. They ſay that is ſmall and white, ſo was this; That falleth downe with the dew, ſo did this; both of them ſweete euen as the hony, and happely the ſubſtance of both, one, &amp;c. But what of all this? Therefore

ſhall it follow that this was not giuen miraculouſly to the Iſraelites? nothing leſſe. For as they weare like in ſome things, ſo were they alſo vnlike. This Manna in the ſhoppes is not ſo ſwéete as this, giuen héere, was: it melteth not away with the Sunne as this did, neither is it ſo hard that it néedeth to be brayed in a morter, or ground on a mill as this was to make bread of it. This Manna came not before a certaine time, and houre, appointed by God and foretold by Moſes. No change of the aire and alteration of the weather hindered the comming of this Manna, but in Sommer, in Winter, in Froſt, in Raine, ſtill ſtill it kept his courſe: and fell downe euery night againſt the morning for the ſpace of fortie yeares together. The abundance of it was aboue any naturall courſe euen inough to ſuffice for ſix hundred thouſand men beſide women and children, ſo long. The ſixt day it was doubled to them, that they might gather both for that day and the next, which was the Sabbaoth: and ſo reſt vpon the Sabbaoth: a very plaine token that all was not naturall. If vpon any day they gathered more than their limmitted proportion, it putrified and rotted, wormes grew in it, and it ſauoured ill. But on the ſixt day when they gathered double, it did not ſo, but was very ſwéete and good, till the next day: yea a pot of it was kept in the Arke, ſweet and good, long, which would not haue béene ſo, if all had béene naturall. Againe whereſoeuer the Iſraelites were, it followed them: and was about their tents, not in other fieldes and places remote from them. Now, they that write of the Arabian Manna ſould in ſhops, ſay it ſpringeth not out of all earth, and by name, not out of deſert places, but out of ſome certaine places only in Arabia, as wée ſée in other matters ſome kinde of earth yeeldeth a ſwéeter, a fatter, and better ſap than other earth dooth. But this Manna followed the Iſraelites, whatſoeuer the earth was: and by name in the wilderneſſe and deſert. No way therefore was this Manna altogether naturall.

                           Laſtly, when they came into the Land of Canaan, which was a more excellent earth, preſently it failed and came no more. A great miraculous worke therefore of God this Manna thus giuen from Heauen was, and ſo to be eſtéemed, that God may haue his due glorie, &amp; we ſuch comfort and inſtruction as will flowe from it. A taſt whereof in this that followeth you may take.
                     
                     
                        The 3. part.
                        1. THey are commaunded to goe forth euery morning to gather this Manna, and to make them bread of it: which teacheth vs thus much, that as God doth ſomething for his part towards the nouriſhing &amp; maintaining of vs, ſo wil he haue vs likewiſe againe to doo ſomething for our parts. Hee wil giue Manna in his mercy and goodnes, but we muſt goe out and gather it: That is, hee wil prouide meate, money, cloath, and all worldly matters for vs, as ſhall be good for vs, but we muſt labour in ſome honeſt &amp; lawfull vocation, and ſo come by theſe things. Idlenes he will not foſter nor abide in any man. Corne he will giue to ye Huſbandman, but (conditionally) that he plough and ſowe. Riches hee will giue to the Merchant, but ſo that he goe to ſea and take paines. Whereupon the Heathens did ſay, Dij omnia vendunt laboribus, The Gods ſell all things for labour.
                            And for the Scripture, it is plentifull in this point, as hath béene ſhewed elſe-where. Man in his innocencie was appointed to dreſſe the Garden, and not ſuffered to be idle. Againe, euery man heere was appointed to gather Manna; which néeded not, if God had liked of Ingroſſers, to take vp all into a fewe hands, and then to deliuer out to others as they pleaſe: but follow this Note farther your ſelfe, and be bettered by it.
                        
                        2. How much might euery one gather? euen ſo much ſaith the Text, as is ſufficient for euery day, ver. 4: that is,

they ſhal prouide for the day &amp; no more. Wherein Note howe carefull the Lord is to haue men depend vpon his prouidence, with chéerefull hope in his goodnes, and not wretchedly and deſpairefully to mucker vp what ſhal neuer doo them good, nor any peraduenture that they purpoſe it for. Thus is the prayer which our Sauiour taught vs, Our daily bread giue vs for the day. And from diſtruſtfull Luke. 11. 3. feare the whole Scripture driueth vs in euery place. He that féedeth the Sparrowe ſo ſmall in price, and heareth the young Rauens that call vpon him, He that openeth his hand and filleth all things liuing with plenteouſnes, will hee either forſake or forget man or woman truſting in him? No; it is a Helliſh thought, and away with it for euer out of your heart. The life is farre more worth than meate; and the body than any rayment. Wee are much better than any fowles, and yet the Lord feedeth them, when they neither ſowe, nor reape, nor carie in to anie barnes. Could not God heere haue bidden them gather for many daies, if he had would, and lay vp in ſtore for a deere yeere, as wee vſe to ſpeake? yet hee would not, but tieth them to a dayes foode, and for the next day to depend vpon him. He failed them no day, nor euer faileth vs if wee beléeue. Caſt your care then chéerefully vpon him, and cleaue faſt vnto him, you ſhal ſée his Mercie, you ſhal ſée his Truth, you ſhal ſée your Comfort. If the earth yéeld neither corne, nor graſſe, and that for fortie yeeres together: yet can hee nouriſh you and yours with bread from Heauen, and the daintie fleſh of Quailes at his pleaſure. The hard Rocke or the drie tooth ſhal yéeld drinke for your thirſt, at his will. Elias had bread and meate brought him by the wilde Rauen: And the little meale and oyle in the Cruze waſted not till the dearth was paſt, and ſo forth as you heard before. Theſe Iſraelites garments were not worne, nor the ſhooes of their feete torne in ſo many yéeres: who then will diſtruſt ſuch a GOD? Hee can doo what hee will doo: and he will doo

what is beſt, be euer aſſured with ioy. Many a time hath the poore woman had no bread in the morning for her children, and before night, both bread and money. Goe farther your ſelfe, for this meditation is moſt ſwéete. That man liueth not, or euer ſhall, who cleauing to God, hath béene forſaken by him.
                        3. For the day then, how much might they gather? without ſtint? No. The Text ſaith, An OMER for a man, 
                           Ver. 16. 
                           according to the number of the perſons: this was the ſtint. Euery man was to take for them in his Tent. This OMER was about a pottle of our meaſure. Marke howe the Lord alloweth a ſufficiencie, and vtterly diſliketh all néedeleſſe ſuperfluitie. Our wanton wils he will not fellowe: but our iuſt néede hee will ſupplie. Would wee learne this bleſſed meane in all our courſes, God would ioy in it, and the childe vnborne be the better for it. Our houſes and land would tarie with vs, and deſcend from vs to them wee loue; our Tenants ſhould taſte of better bargaines, and liue and die at our féete; the poore would ſend a ſhréeking crie to the eares of God, for mercie and goodnes to be poured vpon vs for our relieuing of them; The Common-wealth ſhould finde vs furniſhed, either to defend, or offend vpon occaſion; and in one word, both Heauen and Earth be glad of it. O, why, why then ſhould not our OMER content vs for the day? God is wiſe that made this Lawe, and who euer followed his wiſedome and repented? You ſée the Note, and to a féeling heart I néede not amplifie it any farther.
                        4. But might they gather this pottle of Manna anie time of the day? No. It was to be gathered in the morning: 
                           Ver. 21. 
                           for when the heate of the Sunne came, it was melted. So God would teach them, to take time whileſt time ſerued: And it may well admoniſh vs to doo the like. Wée haue a Morning, &amp; we haue an Euening. Our able youth and good health is our morning▪
                            our feeble Age and ſicke eſtate is our euening. Spend not the firſt vainely, and you

ſhall not want in the laſt vncomfortably. God is good, and giueth vs a gathering time, he looketh we ſhould vſe it as he intendeth, that is, in the morning to goe forth to our labour, honeſtly and truly to liue in a lawfull vocation, to doo what wee are called to, faithfully and carefully. So ſhall we eate the fruite of our labours when the euening of age and ſicknes commeth, and all ſhall be well. But a careleſſe youth and an ill ſpent health will make a wanting age, and an helpleſſe ſicknes. Gods bleſſings are not at our election to haue them when we will, but when wee ſéeke when he bids, we ſhall finde. His Manna is readie if we come in time, and if we linger till we liſt, he hath his Sunne to melt it away, and it is gone. O, take time then, and be ruled by God: youth and health you ſée is a bleſſed time. In the Booke of Wiſedome ſée another v
                                 •
                              e of this time of this day, and euer remember it, namely, That it might be knowne, how wee ought to preuent the Sunne 
                           Wiſd. 16. 28. 
                           riſing, to giue thanks vnto God, and to ſalute him before the day ſpring. For the hope of the vnthankfull ſhall melt as the Winter Ice, and flowe away as vnprofitable waters. 
                           29. Let vs doo thus then, and be moſt aſſured that ſuch Morning ſacrifice ſhall be no leſſe profitable vnto vs than pleaſing to him.
                        5. And did they iuſt gather their meaſure, and no more, euery man? No. The Text ſaith, Some gathered more, 
                           Ver. 17. 18. 
                           and ſome leſſe. Yet when they did meaſure it with an OMER, hee that had gathered much, had nothing ouer, and hee that had gathered little, had no lacke, &amp;c. By which miracle the Lord would both reſtraine the gréedie Scrapers of this world, that are neuer ſatisfied, and comfort his owne Choſen that haue not ſuch heapes. For what hath the greateſt Raker that liues amongſt vs at this day touching himſelfe, but his liuing? and hath not the pooreſt man by his little as much? yes aſſuredly, wee ſée it daily. Nay we ſée more, namely, that this little, little, which the poore man hath, yéeldeth him often a more healthie

life, and a merrier minde, ſounder ſléepe and quieter thoughts, than that great abundance which the gréedie Gatherer hath gotten. Daniel with his thinne fare of pulſe and water, looketh as well or better than they that féede vpon the Kings allowance, ſuch a mighty God euery way is our God. And why then ſhould our deſire to haue, be ſo exorbitant? or our hearts ſo deiected, if wee haue but little? GOD will make my little ſtretch to an OMER, that is, to enough, and his much ſhal be no more, doo what hee can. O minde, minde, then bee content; Looke vpon thy God, and feare nothing: he is the ſame, he is no Changeling, &amp;c,
                        6. Did they reſerue nothing of all their gatherings till the morning? your Chapter goeth on, and ſaith, Let no man reſerue thereof till the morning. Notwithſtanding 
                           Ver. 19. 20. 
                           they obeyed not Moſes, but ſome of them reſerued of it till the morning, and it was full of wormes, and ſtanke: therefore Moſes was verie angrie with them. Sée euer in the world ſome diſobedient and diſtruſtfull wretches, let all the Preachers in the world (were they as good as Moſes) ſay and doo what they can. They will rake, they will ſcrape, they will hoord and muckervp: their wicked Mammon is their GOD, and their Cheſt their hope in time of néede. But what became of Manna it ſelfe, when it was kept contrarie to Gods liking? Wormes bred in it, as you ſée; it ſtanke, and no wayes ſerued to their vſe that ſo diſobediently had laide it vp. Euen ſo, ſo ſhall it euer bee with this Crue, let them make their reckoning of it, and reſt aſſured. Ill gotten goods ſhall not proſper, nor the thirde heire bee the better for them. Our eyes daylie ſée what may teache our hearts, if GOD bee within vs: and this notable place of rotting Manna would neuer bee forgotten.
                        7. Yet the ſixt day they reſerued, and it corrupted not. Uerie true, and let it neuer goe out of your minde Ver. 24.
                           
whileſt you liue. For vpon the ſixt day they were commaunded to gather both for that day and the day following, (ver. 5.) which was the ſeauenth day and the Sabbath: to the end they might reſt vpon the Sabbath: and not goe out to gather, and it corrupted not. No more ſhal any goods you get and gather with the will and good liking, and by the commaundement of Almightie God, that is, truly, lawfully, and with a good conſcience, but the Lord ſhal bleſſe that baſket, and that ſtore to you whileſt you liue, and to yours when you are gone: and though it bee but little, yet hee ſhall make it ſufficient to ſuſtaine your ſelfe, to bring vp your Children, and to doo what they which haue thrice as much as you comming in, cannot doo. Your Children againe after you, maintayned with that which you haue well gotten, ſhall proſper either in learning, or trade, ſo that they ſhall come to great Places often, and to bee Great menne: to carie ſuch Offices of credite as are in the Countrie or Tewne where they dwell, and leaue Gods mercies againe to their Children after them, to a thouſand generations louing and fearing Gods holy Name and kéeping his Commaundements; when the quite contrarie ſhall come to paſſe with the goods ill gotten, as you haue ſéene.
                        8. Forget not to marke héere alſo the great care that GOD hath of his Sabbath, that it bee kept holy according to his appointment, when hee will not ſuffer theſe Iſraelites to gather ſo much as his Manna for their foode vppon the Sabbath day, but appointeth them to doo it the day before. May not a good ſoule thus reaſon then with himſelfe, or her ſelfe? Good Lorde, what doo I vppon the Sabbath day? This people of his, might not gather Manna, and may I ſafelie gad to Faiers and Markettes, to dauncinges and drinkinges, to wakes and wantonneſſe, to Beare-baytinges, and Bull-baytinges, with ſuch like wicked prophanations

of the Lords day? May I bee abſent from the Church, where Gods people are gathered together in his Name, &amp; he in the midſt of them, walking about my Cloſes and grounds, ſending my Seruaunts and Cattle to Townes with corne which I haue ſolde before, becauſe I will not ſpare them on the wéeke daies, and ſo forth? Are theſe works for the Sabbath? Is this to keepe holy the Sabbath day? Can I anſwere this to my God that giueth me ſixe daies for my ſelfe, and taketh but one day to himſelfe of which I rob him alſo? No, no, aſſuredly I ſhall not be able to endure his wrath for theſe thinges one day; and therefore I will leaue them, and regard héereafter his holie Sabbath better than I haue done. Yes aſſuredly this is a ſound and a bleſſed Reaſon: and therefore I pray God to ſet it in our hearts, ſince now a-daies there is ſo much offending this way.
                        9. When came this Manna from Heauen, in the day, or in the night? In the night, when the dewe fell downe, this Heauenly bread fell with it, and in the morning as hath béene noted (verſe, 14) When the dewe aſcended, this lay all ſcattered vpon the earth to be gathered till the heate of the Sunne melted it away (ver. 21.) What a ſwéete Note doo I ſée heere? namely, that when his Children ſléepe and are at reſt, Gods prouidence for them ſléepeth not, but worketh and giueth thinges for their vſe, and for their comfort, for their health, for their life, &amp; for their aduancement vnto honour. Groweth not the graſſe when wee ſléepe, and the beſt hearbs for our health and vſe? Come not the ſwéet ſhowers when we ſléepe that make the Huſbandman reioyce and ſing? Peter was a ſléepe in the priſon, the next day to ſuffer death by cruell tyrannie, watched and warded, and bound with chaines: neither was Acts. 12. 7, 8. there any helpe in mans eyes for him, only the little flocke of Gods Children (gathered together in the houſe of a religious woman) prayed for him; but the prouidence of God was not ſléepe, which watched ouer him and his life, and

ſent his Angell to deliuer him in ſuch miraculous manner as you reade of: euer and euer leauing vs a Teſtimonie of his care, loue, mercie, and power as ſhall be good for vs, the ſwéetneſſe whereof I am not able to reach vnto: but crie with the Prophet from my heart, O bleſſed, bleſſed is the man that hath the Lord for his God! it is better to truſt in him, than in all the Princes of the world: And if he be on our ſide, wee neede not care what man can doo againſt vs. Such another Example is that of king Ahaſueroſh not able to ſléepe, but calling for the Chronicles, and hitting vpon that place where Mordecai his loyaltie and faithfull ſeruice was mentioned, thereby enquiring what had béene done for him, and ſo exalting him to great honour. Poore Mardocheus was a ſléepe when this was done: and little thought of ſuch a matter. But his ſwéete and gracious God was not on ſléepe you ſée, ſending from Heauen his Manna, that is, his comfortable Mercie to his Childes honour, and his whole Churches good by his aduancement. Shall wee euer then fall from this God, by diſtruſtfull feare, that thus careth for his when they be on ſléepe? Lord, Lord giue vs the vſe of theſe thinges, and ſtrengthen our Meditation to an immoueable Faith, and ſtrong comfort in Thee euermore. Conſider the olde generations 
                           Eccleſ. 2. 11. 
                           of men, ſaith the wiſe Sirach, and marke them well: was there euer any confounded that put his truſt in the Lord? Did euer any continue in his feare, and was forſaken? or euer any call vpon him, and was deſpiſed? No, no; no, no. And therefore lay it vp in your heart &amp; marke the Scriptures. If wee beléeue that he hath made our bodies; ſhall wee not alſo beléeue that hee will prouide for Math. 6. 25. Pſal. 139. 17, them, ſéeing the creation is greater than the preſeruation? Hath hee care ouer the wicked to doo them good, and will hee not much more reioyce to doo his Children good? Did the Lord loue vs when wee were his enemies? and will he leaue vs ſuccourleſſe when we are reconciled to him in ſo déere a price as his owne Sonnes precious blood? O, if

he did vs good when hee might haue puniſhed vs for our ſinnes, will not hée now doo vs good, when through his grace we hate ſinne, in ſome meaſure ſanctified by his holy Spirit? Hee will, he will, and neuer feare therefore, but cleaue faſt. Thinke with your ſelfe how the Fathers before the floud eating nothing but hearbes, yet liued ſome ſeuen hundred, ſome eight hundred, &amp; ſome nine hundred yeares; &amp; know by it that man liueth not by theſe meanes, but if neither graſſe, nor corne, nor any vſuall foode now amongeſt vs were in the earth, yet could God Preſerue vs and keepe vs both aliue, and in health, and in good liking. But much more now by fleſh and fiſh and his other good bleſſings can he do it. Moſes &amp; Elias liued forty daies Exod. 34. 8. 1. King. 19. 8. Deut. 2. 7 without meate: and the Iſraelites walked (as I noted) forty yeares in the wilderneſſe with the ſame apparrell not waxen olde. By which and many ſuch things mo in the Scriptures, you ſee that the bleſsing of God is all in all; and that theſe earthly meanes are but things giuen of GOD for our vſe, which yet he can want when hee will; &amp; notwithſtanding preſerue vs. Up with your hart then, how hard ſoeuer the world goeth with you, and fix both heart and eies vpon GOD, beléeue his Scriptures and reade them for your comfort, all ſhalbe well, aſſure your ſelfe in his time.
                        10 The Lord by Moſes commaundeth a pot of this Manna to be kept in the Arke for a remembrance euer of 
                           ver. 32 33. 
                           this great miracle, and ſo it was; which very notably may teach vs, euer to be carefull to keepe in minde the gracious fauoures of our good God ſhewed vnto vs, and not to ſuffer them to be forgotten. The Scripture often layeth this point before our eies, if you remember. As in Deut. Take heede to thy ſelfe, and keepe thy ſoule diligently, 
                           Deut. 4. 9 
                           that thou forget not the things which thine eies haue ſeene, and that they depart not out of thine heart all the daies of thy life: but teach them thy ſonnes, and thy ſons ſonnes. So in the ſixt Chapter againe. Theſe wordes 
                           Deut. 66.
                           
                           which I commaund thee this day, ſhalbe in thy heart. And 
                           7. 
                           thou ſhalt rehearſe them continually vnto thy children, &amp; ſhalt talke of them when thou tarieſt in thine houſe, &amp; as thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lyeſt downe, and when thou riſeſt vp. And thou ſhall binde them for 
                           8. 
                           a ſigne vpon thy hand, and they ſhall be as frontlets betweene thine eyes. Alſo thou ſhalt write them vpon the 
                           9. 
                           poſtes of thine houſe, and vppon the gates, &amp;c. When they paſſed ouer Iordā
                            on dry land preſently twelue ſtones were ſet vp for a remembrance. Dauid in his Pſalme, Ioſua 4. 21. Pſal. 103. 2. 
                           Prayſe the Lord O my Soule, and forget not, forget not all his benefits. So the Fathers haue many good Sayings to this end. As Saint Gregorie. So much ſhall thy Soule finde more ſweet reſt in Heauen, by how much thou giueſt thy minde leſſe reſt in this Worlde from the continuall remembrance of GOD and his Workes. If thy Corne lay in a low moiſte and dankiſhe vault, where it might putrifie and corrupt, Wouldeſt thou not ſpeedelie and carefully raiſe it vp to a higher and ſweeter Place, that ſo it might continue ſweete? Why then dooeſt thou ſuffer thy Minde to lye ſo lowe among the rotten thinges of this World, that alſo will corrupt it with a grieuous corruption, and dooeſt not ſpéedely and carefullie alſo raiſe it vp to a ſweete remembrance of GODS fauoures and great workes for thee, for thy Neighboures, for thy Countrie, for his Church and Children in all ages? Here, here is the ſweete beeing of the Minde, and not below. Againe, marke how the eyes of thy bodie (if they bée in a ſmokie place) are vered and grieued with that foule ſmoake, and ſhedde out their teares to bee deliuered there hence: So thinke of the light of thy minde, that with vile thinges it is much offended, but with remembrance of good things much pleaſed and bettered. Euer therefore let it haue his comfort: and looke vpon that pot of Manna which God hath giuen thee from

heauen, that is vpon his mercies and fauoures vouchſafed vnto thée many waies in thy life time, which to thée are the Teſtimonies of his loue and gracious prouidence, as this Manna here was to the Iſraelites. Another ſaith, Will the young Lamb be drawne from his damme, or the young kid, the young calfe, the little chickens, and ſuch like? will not they ſtill kéepe with their kinde, not ſtray away farre, but run to the damme againe? So certainely ſhould our mindes not ſtray from our God, and the thankfull remembrance of his mercies: but euer kéepe here, and tarie here, and ioy here as in our ſwéete and quiet comfort. A good carefull ſeruant is ſtill in his Maiſters eye, and cannot abide to be farre off. No more can the ſeruant of God aſſuredly bée pleaſed in the forgetfulneſſe of his God and his great workes. The fire of the Altar went not out either by night or by day: No more ſhould the fire within you, that is, the heate of thankfull féeling and due remembrance of Grace receiued from a ſwéete God. The Prieſts did bring wood to that fire vppon the Altar, and ſtill nouriſh it that it might euer burne: ſo will the zealous Preacher to thy inward Soule giue a holy heate, continually, &amp; kéepe in that bleſſed fire of loue, of zeale, of thankfulneſſe and ſo foorth, to Almightie God, if thou diligently frequent his company and heare his words. For the Lord hath appointed him to this end, to kéep this fire within his people, and his ordinance ſhall not be in vaine, vnleſſe the fault be yours. What a heate will the fire giue to the coldeſt water if it be ſet to it? But remooue the ſame water from the fire againe, and it returneth to his former coldneſſe: So, ſo is it in the matter we ſpeake of, and forget it not. The preſerued fruite that is bailed in ſugar looſeth his owne tartneſſe, and taketh a ſwéeter taſte from the ſugar, that all men may know where it hath béen: And euen ſo aſſuredly wil a minde much meditating on Gods benefits, and (to the end it may the better doo it) much frequenting the reading and hearing of the Word, taſt moſt ſwéetly

both with God and Man. Wherefore follow this aduiſe of Scripture and Fathers, and learne by this reſeruing of Manna for a remembrance, what an acceptable thing to God, and what a fit dutie for his ſeruant this carefull remembrance of his works is.
                        11. Now as by this Figure of the kept Manna, men were taught to remember all Gods mercies in generall: So in particular it did lay before the Iſraelites the promiſed ſéede Chriſt Ieſus, of when it was a very notable Type, and therefore may likewiſe teach vs, as to remember all Gods mercies, ſo (by name) this great mercie aboue all, the gift of his deare and bleſſed Sonne our Sauiour for vs. The type is reſembled by learned men in this ſort. Firſt, Manna came down from heauen, ſo did Chriſt as touching 
                              Iohn. 6. 41. Datum, paratū, Donum non debitum, Beneficiū largientis, non praemium accipientis. Eſay. 53. 3. his deitie. Secondly, Manna ſignifieth a gift or a thing prepared: ſo was Chriſt giuē &amp; prepared by the loue of God, without all merit or cauſe in vs. Thirdly, Manna was but a ſmall and contemptible thing to looke on; ſo was Chriſt little regarded of earthly minded worldlings, but as the Prophet notably declareth, much deſpiſed &amp; ſet at naught. Manna was round, which is ye perfecteſt figure, and ſo was Chriſt a perfect Sauiour to all that euer beléeued in him. Manna was white, the colour of innocencie, and our Sauiour Chriſt without ſpot or blot of any ſin. Manna was ſweet and like the hony, ſo is Chriſt ſwéeter than any hony to all thoſe that taſt him by a true Faith. Manna was bruſed and beaten in morters and milles, Chriſt was tormented for our ſins with many torments. All were commanded to gather Manna, and all that trauell and are heauie laden 
                           Matth. 11. 28. are commaunded to come and take holde of Chriſt. Manna continued till they came into the land of promiſe 
                           Mat. 28. 20. 1. Cor. 15. 24 27. 28. &amp; then ceaſed, Chriſt ſhalbe with vs to the end of the world, ſhal ſubdue all things vnder his feete, and then himſelfe be ſubiect to God, deliuer vp the Kingdome to him, that God may be all in all. Thus notably you ſee was Chriſt foreſhadowed in this Manna. The Iſraelites might not

forget the ſhadow, and may we forget the ſubſtance and thing it ſelfe? No, no. And therefore well prayed the old Father, Da Domne vt ſicut verbum caro factum eſt, ſic cor meum fiet carneum. Lord graunt that as the word became fleſh, ſo my hart may be alſo fleſhy, and not ſtony, Maieſtie hūbled it ſelf, &amp; ſhal miſerie exalt it ſelf? Remember often &amp; remember euer this ſweet Manna. Puer natus, Filius datus, A Childe is borne, a Son is giuen. Datus ex diuinitate, natus 
                           Eſay. 9. 6.

                              oeretur: Datus, ex quo vitanaſceretur. Sic qui erat, Datus; qui non erat, Natus, Giuen in regard of his Deitie▪ Borne in regard of his humanitie. Borne, who ſhoulde haue an end. Giuen who had no beginning. Borne, who was yonger than his mother. Giuen, who was as old as his Father. Borne, who ſhould die. Giuen, from whom life ſhould ſpring. So he that was, was Giuen, and he that was not, was Borne. Ambulare vis? ego ſum via: falli 
                           Ioh. 14. 6. 
                           non vis? ego ſum veritas: mori non vis? ego ſum vita. Noc dicit tibi Saluatortuus, non eſt quo eas, niſi ad me; non eſt qua eas, niſi per me. Surge homo, via venit ad 
                                 •
                              e. Wilt thou walke? I am the way: wilt not thou be deceiued? I am the truth; wilt thou not die? I am the life. This ſaith thy Sauiour to thee. There is none to goe vnto but to mee, there is none by whom thou maiſt goe, but by mee. Ariſe O man, the way commeth vnto thee.
                            Thus remember (I ſay) againe this bleſſed Manna, and let this much ſuffice of this Chapter.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. 17.
                     
                        
                           The generall Heades of this Chapter are two.
                           
                              A bitter contention for want of water.
                              A warre with Amalech.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        1. COncerning the firſt, thus wée may profit, in ye wilderneſſe of Sin they ver. 1. complaine of famine and wiſh for the fleſhpottes of Egypt againe, and for their bellies full of bread. Thence they remooue and come to Rephidim, where they as bitterly complaine for want of water. So to an earthly minde that will not looke at God, euery place miniſtreth ſome diſcontentment; when a heart grounded in pietie, taketh all well that God ſendeth: and learneth as well to want as to abound. Againe euen to the godlie, Philip. 4. 12. ſuch as many of theſe Iſraelites were (for we may not vnderſtand that all were guilty of theſe murmurings, but a great ſort, or the greater ſort) one croſſe ſuccéedeth another, that ſtill our life may bée a true warrefare and no heauen made of earth. A man that is borne of a woman, (ſaith holy Iob) hath but a ſhort time to liue, &amp; is full of trouble, 
                           Iob. 14. 1. ful of trouble I ſay againe, &amp; we muſt mark it. So ſhal we grow to the Apoſtles reſolution, deſiring to be looſed and 
                           Philip. 1. 23. 
                           to be with Chriſt which is beſt of all. For neuer ſhall wée haue permanent comfort till that day come, but ſtill a mixture and an vnequall mixture; more of the ſowre than of the ſweet, more of the woe than of ye 
                           weale, that we may crye hartily, Come Lord Ieſu, come quickly. 
                           Reuel. 22. 20.
                        
                        2 When they are pinched with this want of water
                           
what doo they? Not cry vnto God, but flie vpon Moſes with an vnfitting ſpéech ſaying, Giue vs water that wee 
                           Ver. 2. 
                           may drinke; as though Moſes were God to create fountaines and ſprings. Thus dooth corrupt man poſſeſſed with impatiencie take a wrong courſe, leaue God and runne to Man, and then ſpeake according to his rage, without due and right conſideration of Mans ability and power. A like ſpéech had good Rachel to her huſband Iacob, when impatiencie had caught her, Giue me children. To whom Iacob 
                           Gen. 30. 1. anſwered not without griefe, AM I GOD &amp;c? Let vs therefore, in all our wants, ſet our faces the right way, and looke to Heauen, not to Earth; to God, not to Man. For there is the treſurie and the bottomleſſe ſtore-houſe of all comforts. Aske there, ſeeke there, knocke there, and you haue a promiſe. Runne to creatures and you Mat. 7. 7. haue none. Againe Moſes was the Magiſtrate ſet ouer them by God, and therefore an high offence to contend with him, to bee troubleſome to him, and to grieue him. Such malecontents are odious to God, and their ends, if they continue in their faultes, euer foule. Moſes was further a méeke Gouernour and moſt milde, the Scripture ſaith of him, that he was the meekeſt man aliue: He had Numb. 12. 3. deliuered them from a bloody bondage, and bene Gods inſtrumēt of many benefits &amp; comforts. The more therfore was their fault a great deale, ye better &amp; ſwéeter his gouernment was to them. Let it teach as many as haue the like bleſſing to auoide the like ſin, &amp; to be thankful both to God, and his meanes. It is regiſtred for a praiſe euer to indure, &amp; the remembrance of it God will not haue put out, that when a rebellious ſpirit made a commotiō againſt Dauid ye 
                           2. Sam. 20. 1. &amp;c. Lords annointed, &amp; the men of Iſrael fooliſhly &amp; wickedly followed him, &amp; forſooke their King, yet the men of Iuda would not doo it, but as the Text ſaith, They claue faſt vnto their King: to their good King, their religious King, their natural Prince, their louing Lord &amp; Gouernour annointed and ſet ouer them by a mighty God. No Charmes would

they hearken vnto againſt him, but claue faſt vnto him, and I ſay againe, the praiſe of it ſhall neuer dye.
                        3 They are ſaide alſo to tempt the Lord; A further degrée of ſinne in them. Which all men doo, when they doubt of his power, his will, and his truth, when they take vpon them to preſcribe waies &amp; meanes how they wil be helped: and doo not patiently expect his comfort by ſuch waies and meanes, and in ſuch time as to him ſhall ſéeme good. That thus they tempted him the 7. ver. ſheweth, Ver. 7. where they ſay, Is the Lord among vs? making that a Queſtion which was ſo manifeſt, vnleſſe they might haue what they would, &amp; when they would, and as they would. Had euer people greater Teſtimonies of Gods preſence amōg them than they? Did not they euen at this time receiue euery morning a tokē of it, whē they gathered Manna? O impatiece then! whither wilt thou carry our corrupt nature, if God ſtay thée not? far otherwiſe did that Saint of God Dauid, when in as great a diſtreſſe as this hee ſaid, 2. Sam. 15. 25. 
                           Carry the Arke of God againe into the City: if I ſhal finde fauour in the eies of God, he will bring me againe, and ſhew me both it, and the Tabernacle thereof. But if he 26. thus ſay, I haue no delight in thee, hehold here am I, let him doo to me as ſeemeth good in his eies. Here is patience and contentment in Gods holy wil whatſoeuer it is, bée it to weale, or be it to Woe, bee it to Life, or be it to, Death. And what Man or Woman euer loſte by carying themſelues thus towardes their GOD? Dauid founde a bleſſing of this courſe, and returned in ſafetie to his houſe. The Rebelles againſt him beeing confounded and ſcatered in GODS powerfull iuſtice. Pray it therefore with your heart as you doo with tongue, and pray it often both with Heart and Tongue, Thy will be done, Thy will bee done, O my Father, with me euer. In it will I reſt, in it will I ioye by thy helping grace, and bee alwaies aſſured of thy true Worde. All thinges euen all thinges worke for the beſt to them that loue

thee. I could note by theſe mutinies and ſtirres, the difficultie of gouernment, the nature of the multitude, the lot of Gods Miniſters and ſuch like, but before they haue béene touched vpon diuers the like occaſions; nothing muſt diſcourage a man in that calling that God hath placed him in. Vae tibi ſi praes, &amp; non prodes, ſed vae grauius, ſi quiapraeeſſe metuis, prodeſſe refugis. Woe be to thee, if thou gouerne and doeſt not profit, but more woe be vnto thee, if becauſe thou art afraide to gouerne, thou refuſe to profit,
                            ſaith S. Bernard.
                        
                        4. Then Moſes cried vnto the Lord ſaying, what ſhall I doo to this people? for they bee almoſt readie to ſtone 
                           ver. 4. 
                           me. The true refuge of Magiſtrate, Miniſter, and all godlie, is euer to flie vnto the Lord by hearty and earneſt prayer, as héere you ſée Moſes doth. Thus againe, when Pharaoh purſued to the red Sea: and in bath places his prayer 
                           Exod. 14. 15. is called a crying for the earneſtnes of it in his heart, although he ſpake neuer a word with his mouth. So ſaith Dauid in his Pſalme, Thus and thus they abuſed me, but I gaue my ſelfe to prayer.
                            It is a bleſſed courſe and neuer Pſal. 109. 4. faileth them that vſe it. But ſtand you not amazed at the other part of the verſe? namely, that they were readie almoſt to ſtone Moſes, ſuch a man, ſuch a Magiſtrate, ſo déere to God, ſo profitable to them, ſo famous in all Egypt, and almoſt ouer the world, for thoſe great works wherewith it had pleaſed God to grace him? O turba quám ſemper es turbulenta? O world world, what truſt is to be repoſed in thee? this is the conſtancie of thy fauour euer. The Multitude is thus to be reckoned of, be a mans deſerts neuer ſo good, and yet how hunt many after this breath? howe ſpend they? how ſpoile they themſelues and all theirs to be great with the people, and to be ſpoken of by the multitude, neuer thinking in due time of the nature of this greatnes, and what all monuments of learning haue ſaide of it? Doo not the Scriptures ſhew vs, how reuerently the Phariſies ſent vnto Iohn, and yet after affirmed him to 
                           Math. 11. 18.
                           
                           haue the Deuill? Whereupon, our Sauiour Chriſt vttereth a Sentence worthie to bee written in a wiſe mans heart for euer, Iohn was a burning and ſhining candle; 
                           Iohn. 5. 35. 
                           and yee would for a ſeaſon haue reioyced in his light. Marke theſe wordes (for a ſeaſon) and ſettle them ſoundly in your heart, that they may euer ſhewe you, that were you as great as Iohn Baptiſt, who had not a greater amongſt 
                           Math. 11. 11. 
                           them that were begotten of women, yet your credite is but for a ſeaſon with worldly men, and with the common multitude. To day a man, to morrowe a beaſt, to day none better, to morrowe none worſe, to day a God, to morrowe a Deuill. The Lord Ieſus himſelfe found this meaſure, and all his Diſciples and Seruants after him. Abſalon would write kindly to Ioab to day, 2. Sam. 14. and tomorrowe ſet his corne on fire. The world weigheth without Ballance, numbreth without Counters, and meaſureth without Rule. The Ballance, Counters, and Rule of the world, is a fickle fading, hote and haſtie humour for a time. Howe cloſe and faſt will the Quickefiluer cleaue vnto the gold? you would thinke it could neuer be gotten away, yet as ſoone as the fire commeth, it is gone and no ſigne to be ſéene of it. Euen ſo is the liking of the world not louing in GOD and for GOD. They that runne at Tilt, looke to the Iudges what they ſay, and not what the vulgar people ſay. So muſt a wiſe man euer looke, what his Iudge in Heauen alloweth, and not what inconſtant men on earth praiſe.
                        If anie-man would warne you of the fall of the houſe wherein you are, you would ſoone bee gone, and ſhall no warning ſerue to make you auoyde the tottering applauſe of the worlde? Glorious Haman howe ſoone is hee downe, and his glorie gone as if it had neuer beene: Great Holophernes that was ſo fearefull with his power, falleth and vaniſheth in a moment. Mightie Antiochus the King of Syria what a change found hee in an inſtant? Hee that hangeth vpon

the worlds opinion ſhal to day bee great to morrow little, and the third day no body. In one day, and almoſt in one houre, Ioram the King of Iſrael, Ochozias the King of Iuda, and wicked Iezabel, all ſecure in peace and worldly comfort, are ſlaine by Iehu, and their pompe gone. That potent Monarch Alexander after ſuch glory and fame dieth in his flower, and lieth 30 daies vnburied, his friends being buſie in ſharing his Kingdomes. Valerian the Emperour taken of the Perſian King, is made a footeſtoole for him to tread vpon in going to his horſe. Such Stories manie our Bookes haue: but theſe ſuffice for a taſt. If God and man haue found the worlds loue fickle, ſhal you onely finde it faſt? beléeue it not; But remember worthie Moſes héere, readie to be ſtoned, by thoſe that euen now when the Sea was deuided, honoured him greatly. You can neuer giue any people ſo many cauſes to ſticke vnto you, as he did giue this people to cleaue vnto him, and yet they failed. Write it therefore in your hands, and in your heart for euer, and in well doing depend vpon God, you ſhall finde him neuer to faile you. Marke alſo your Marginall Note héere in your Bible.
                        
                        5. What anſwereth the Lord, to this inward crie of his gréeued and troubled ſeruant Moſes? Sée I pray you in the two verſes following, the 5. and the 6. He biddeth 
                           Ver. 5. 6. 
                           him take his rod, and ſtrike a hard ſtonie rocke: and it ſhould yeeld the people water to drinke, and for their cattle alſo at full. A mightie powerfull worke of God, and full of good inſtructions for all thoſe that wil obſerue them. As firſt, that againſt ſuch a rebellious people ſo froward, ſo ſtubborne, and ſo forgetfull of his former fauours, yet he thundreth not out wrath and iudgements as they deſerued, but mildly and mercifully ſtill dealeth with them, adding mercie to mercie, fauour to fauour, and goodnes to goodnes, for all their euill. So teaching all Gouernours patience and long ſuffering, not to followe with rigour &amp; extremitie all wrongs, not ſetting power againſt folly,

and yéelding meaſure for meaſure in full recompence of ill deſerts, but according to the Courſe of God here doing good for euill, euen to men of bittēr tongues and naughtie hearts againſt vs, to men forgetfull of the good wee haue done them, and euery way deſeruing euill of vs. I know, I know, this is ſoone ſaid, but not ſo ſoone done. For fleſh and blood cannot away with this courſe. There is a law in our members that rebelleth againſt this Counſaile. But what then? héere is my God before mee, the beſt patterne that can be followed: who hath power to puniſh, and yet ſpareth, who hath power to hurt, and yet helpeth, who hath power to kill with the breath of his mouth ten thouſand worlds, and yet ſaueth all, and ſlayeth not the meaneſt man of all this company that murmured againſt him. And his power in me can worke that, which otherwiſe my corruption will not abide to yéeld vnto. That ſpirit therefore ſo powerfull, I will pray for to make me able to followe this example of my Almightie Father, and I wil ſet this Precedēt before mine eyes to direct me and teach me, as any way I ſhal be able to learne. His bleſſed ſeruant the Apoſtle S. Paule treadeth in the ſame ſteps when hee ſaith, Deerely beloued, auenge not your ſelues, but giue 
                           Rom. 12. 19. 
                           place to wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine: I will repay. Recompence to no man euill for euill: but ouercome 
                           17. &amp; 21. 
                           euill with goodnes, &amp;c.
                        
                        
                           Secondly, it yéeldeth a moſt ſtrong comfort vnto vs in all our wants. For can we euer thinke that this GOD which regardeth the néed of ſuch Rebels and giueth them helpe euen miraculouſly, will deſpiſe our wants and ſuffer vs in them to periſh without reliefe? Search (I ſay) your owne Soule, &amp; tell me if you can harbour ſuch a thought againſt ſo ſwéete a God? If you cannot, but abhorre to doo it, then ſée how you are aſſured by this Place, of his bleſſed prouidence for you and yours, yea euen for your very Cattle if they want but water. And clap both your hands vpon it, binde it to your heart, and let it neuer depart from

you whileſt life endureth in this world of wants. What moued him to this mercie you ſée, not their merits but his owne promiſe onely and goodnes. Reaſon then euer with your weake heart, true to them and not true to me? O fie, fie, auoide vile thought, my God is euer true in all his promiſes, and to all his Children, neuer failing anie that relieth vpon him. I will tarie therefore the Lords leaſure, and ſubmit my ſelfe to his good will: for hee that helped ſuch Repiners as theſe, will in his good time looke vppon my want. The eyes of my poore Children ſhall waite vpon him for bread and drinke: and hee ſhall fill them with his bleſſing when and howe hee thinketh fit.
                        
                           Thirdly, it is a profitable obſeruation héere, to ſée how no euill in man can driue GOD from his promiſe; and yet Sathan will ſuggeſt ſtill, O, thou art not worthie of mercie, thou art ſinfull and a great great ſinner, thou muſt bee puniſhed in Gods iuſtice, hee cannot ſpare thée, therefore trouble him not, hope not in him, for there is no mercie for ſuch a one, &amp;c. Why vile Sathan, is my comfort repoſed in mine owne worth? or doo I reſt vpon mine owne merit? I tell thée I confeſſe all thou ſayeſt of mine owne vnworthineſſe, and therefore haue no hope that way, but I looke at his promiſe, and I conſider his truth, and I ſée heere and euery where that no euill in man can make him euill by breaking his promiſe, therefore I may not deſpaire. I haue his promiſe, that hee will forgiue a gréeued ſinner at all times, for all ſinnes were they as red as blood: and that hee will neuer caſt any away that commeth vnto him. I beléeue him and I will bee comforted Iohn. 6. 37. in his neuer fayling truth: auaunt thou vile Tempter from mee. Though the Lord ſhould kill mee, yet will I put my truſt in him. In which holy diſpute with your Iob. 13. 15. ſelfe, remember I pray you, the olde Fathers howe they haue gone before you in this point, Tota ſpes mea est in morte Domini mei, mors eius meritum meum. Refugium meum,

ſalus mea, vita mea, reſurrectio mea, meritum meum miſeratio Domini. Non ſum inops meriti, quamdiu ille non est inops miſerationis. Et ſi miſericordiae Domini multae, multus ego ſum in meritis. Quanto ille potentior ad ſaluandum, tanto ſum ego ſecurior. Peccaui peccatum grande, &amp; multorum ſum conſcius mihi delictorum, non tamen despero; quia vbi abundauit delictum ibi ſuperabundauit gratia, &amp;c. All my hope is on the death of my Lord, his death is my merit. My refuge, my health, my life, my reſurrection, My merit is the Lords mercie. And I am not voyde of merit ſo long as hee is not voyde of mercie. If his mercies bee many my merits bee alſo many. And the ſtronger hee is to ſaue, the more ſecure and ſafe am I. My ſinne is great that I haue committed, yea I am guiltie of many ſinnes, yet deſpaire I not; for where ſinne aboundeth Grace hath ſuper-abounded. Hee that deſpaireth of the forgiuenes of his ſinnes, denieth GOD to bee mercifull, yea hee denieth as much as lyeth in him that GOD hath loue, truth and power, in which three all my comfort conſiſteth, to wit, in the loue of his adoption, in the truth of his promiſe, and in his power to performe. Let my fooliſh Cogitation then mutter what it liſteth within mee, ſaying, who art thou? or by what merit or worthineſſe doeſt thou hope to obtaine ſuch greate glorie? I comfortablie will aunſwere I knowe whom I haue beleeued, and I am ſure that in loue hee hath adopted mee to bee his Childe, that hee is true in his promiſe, and powerfull in performance. And theſe three ſo ſtrengthen my heart, that no want of merit, no conſideration of my owne vileneſſe, no greatneſſe of the future bleſſedneſſe canne caſt mee downe from the height of hope, wherein I am ſoundlie rooted. This is the three-folde corde, &amp;c. To this effect haue many other Fathers written alſo, but I omit them.
                        
                           Laſtly, this example of God in this place, as it teacheth

                           patience and long ſuffering when we are abuſed, ſo doth it notablie alſo teach cōſtancie in loue where we once haue loued. A thing worthie following, if I had not béene too long in this Note. I will therefore reſerue it to ſome other place, onely now praying you to remember whom you reſemble, if this grace be in you, and from whom you ſwerue if it bee not. It is enough to mooue a Childe of God.
                        6. Of this ſtriking of the Rocke there is often mention made in the Scriptures; and therefore a thing worthie good conſideration. Hee claue the hard rocks in the Wildernes; 
                           Pſal. 78. 15. 
                           and gaue them drinke thereof, as if it had beene out of the great depthes. He brought waters out of the ſtonie rock, 
                           16. 
                           ſo that it guſhed out like the riuers. Againe in another Pſalme, He opened the rocke of ſtone, and the waters flowed 
                           Pſal. 105. 41. 
                           out, ſo that riuers ranne in drie places. For why? he remembreth his holy promiſe and Abraham his ſeruant. 
                           42. The things we may thinke of are theſe, The fall of Moſes and Aaron at this time, The figure and allegorie of this rocke. Concerning the firſt reade what is written in the Booke of Numbers. Moſes and Aaron gathered the congregation 
                           Numb. 20. 10. 
                           together before the rocke; and Moſes ſaid vnto thē, Heare now, yee Rebels: ſhall we bring you water out of this rocke? And the Lord ſaid to Moſes and Aaron, Becauſe yee beleeued me not, to ſanctifie me in the preſence 
                           12. 
                           of the children of Iſrael, therefore yee ſhall not bring this congregation into the Land which I haue giuen them. Héere you ſée it reuealed that Moſes and Aaron ſtaggered at this matter, and offended the Lord. Whereby we are notably taught, that although there be many in this world who through the grace that is giuen them, fight a good fight, hauing faith and a good Conſcience: yet there is not one frée from all ſinne, ſauing Ieſus Chriſt alone. But euen Moſes himſelfe héere that Great light, hath his darknes and his infirmitie. Hee that had wrought ſuch Great miracles, and deuided the maine Sea through the power of

him that now biddeth him ſtrike the rocke: yet héere hee doubteth and fainteth in Faith, as God himſelfe witneſſeth of him. Truly therefore ſaid the Prophet Dauid, If the Lord ſhall marke what is done amiſle, Who, Who ſhall be able to abide it? And the Apoſtle likewiſe, There 
                           Rom. 3. 10. 
                           is none that is righteous, no not one. All haue gone out of the way: And in the ſight of God can no fleſh liuing be 
                           12. 
                           iuſtified. Let not Sachan then amaze vs with our imperfections: for the ſwéeteſt Roſes haue their prickels; and Chriſt came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance. On the other ſide againe, Let not Sathan tempt vs to a conceipt of purity or perfection either in our ſelues, or others: for if Moſes fall, if Dauid fall, if Samuel fall, if Iob fall, if Abraham fall, and all haue fallen, who ſhall ſay, my heart is cleane? Beware of theſe extremities both wayes, &amp; walking in the middle way, take holde of Chriſt, by him fearing no imperfection, and for him flying all vaine thoughts of abſolute integritte. Againe, learne heere and forget it neuer, what an odious thing in the ſight of God any doubting in him is, which yet the Doctrine of Rome ſo laboureth to maintaine. For when for this onely fault the Lord is ſo moued with his déere ſeruant Moſes, that he reiectech him from conducting his people into the promiſed Land, and burieth him in the Deſert: certainly we may not entertaine doubting in our hearts, touching any promiſe of his, and eſpecially in ſo great a matter, or in ſuch a graund Article of Faith as the Remiſſion of ſinnes is.
                        
                        7. For the ſecond thing, namely the Type: you reade in the Apoſtle, that this rocke was Chriſt, that is, a Figure of Chriſt. With which kinde of phraſe would the Romiſh Teachers not wrangle, that Great contention about the Sacrament néeded uot. For to giue the name of the thing ſignified to the ſigne ſignifying was neuer ſtrange among learned men, and in this very particular of the Sacrament, S. Auguſtines words are well knowne, Non dubitabat Dominus dieere hoc est corpus meū, cum ſignum daret corporis

ſui: The Lord doubted not to ſay, This is my bodie when he gaue a ſigne of his body:
                            To which end alſo ſpeake other of the Fathers abundantly, if it were any purpoſe here to enter into his matter.
                        8 For the thirde thing, namely the Allegorie, thus is it noted by the learned. That when all mankind was to be ſmitten by the Law for ſinne; yet through the infinite loue of God the Rocke onelie was ſmitten, that is, Chriſt of whom ye 
                           Law laid hold for vs, &amp; hée ſubmitting himſelfe for vs, was ſmitten off it for vs. Thus ſaith the Prophet, He was ſmitten for our tranſgreſſions, and with his ſtripes we 
                           Eſay. 53. 5. 
                           are healed. Other Scriptures alſo, That God ſo loued the 
                           Iohn 3. 16. 
                           world, that he gaue his onely be gotten Sonne to ſuffer. &amp;c. That he himſelfe bare our ſinnes in his body on the 
                           1. Pet. 2. 24. 
                           tree, &amp;c. This bleſſed rocke thus ſmitten for vs hath guſhed out ſwéete water for vs to drinke, &amp; to coole that ſcalding heate of burning ſin in our ſoules, which els would quickely kill vs and be our bane. Whoſoeuer drinketh of the water that I ſhall giue him ſaith this our Rocke and Iohn. 4. 14. Sauiour, ſhall neuer be more a thirſt, but the water that I ſhall giue, ſhall be in him a well of water, ſpringing vp to euerlaſting life. But let no man thinke that this water that is, the ſwéete and cheering comfort of the Goſpell, is to be got by mans merites (as ſome teach) but euer remember the Prophets words, Ho, euery one that thirſteth come ye to the waters, and ye that haue no ſiluer, come 
                           Eſay. 55 1. 
                           buy and eate; come, I ſay, buy wine and milke without ſiluer and without monie. &amp;c. The Prophets words are ſull of force. Firſt, calling to All to come, and excepting none, which is a great cōfort: &amp; thē
                            offering mercy without money, that all curſed cogitations of workes and worthes in our ſelues, might euer die and be abhorred. Come vnto me all ye that trauell and are heauy laden, and I will refreſh you, not your owne merits and works. The blood of Ieſus Chriſt clenſeth vs, ſaith the Apoſtle, from al ſin; al ſin I ſay againe, and not our workes from any. He, he is the

propitiation for our ſins, and nothing els wholly or partly. Therfore let vs doo no wrong to this bleſſed Rocke, but being thankfull to God, Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt, let vs looke to bée ſaued onely by that meanes that ſo gratiouſly is prouided, and drinke wée euer and onely of this water.
                        
                     
                     
                        The 2. part.
                        
                           THen came Amalech and fought with Iſrael in Rephidim. 
                           Ver. 8. I ſtill like to put you in remembrance, that as God hath giuen vs bodies, ſo hath he giuen vs ſoules; and as meate for the bodie, ſo for the ſoule, euen his holy and bleſſed Word. If the body féede not, it cannot liue; and if the ſoule féede not, it muſt likewiſe die. If the body eate, &amp; yet féele no taſte of ſwéetneſſe and comfort in the meate, or digeſt it not wel in the ſtomacke and conuert it to good nutriment for the parts, wee ſay and thinke the bodie is ſicke, and verelie ſo is it with the ſoule. Wherefore euer thinke with your ſelfe, when you haue red, or heard read vnto you a piece of Scripture, what you are the better for it, what taſte, what reliſh, what vſe and profit you haue by it. And if you finde any, thank your God, and be much comforted with it, for it is an aſſured taken that your ſoule is in health. But if you finde none, cal for the Phyſition, euen the Phyſition of your ſoule, and pray him to help you. God ſhalbe pleaſed with your care, and giue a bleſſing. But if he be abſent, and not at hand, til hee come take this my labour, and as farre as it goeth make vſe of it. It may pleaſe God to make it profitable, at leaſt it ſhall ſhew you how I my ſelfe profited both in that which is paſt, and now againe in this ſecond part.
                        
                        1 Firſt then I ſee heere a warre, and it is the Firſt
                           
warre that theſe Iſraelites had after their deliuerance out of Egypt. I thinke with my ſelfe (meditating of it) why God ſhould ſuffer his choſē people deliuered by him with ſuch a mighty arme from Pharaoh, and directed altogether in their iourney by him (for they trauelled not but when and which way he by the cloude in the day, and the pillar of fire in the night directed them) I ſay, I thinke with my ſelfe, why God ſhould ſuffer his people to be troubled in their way, and ſet vpon and fought withall? And I conceiue theſe vſes. Firſt, that he might fit them for great conflicts which they muſt haue in the execution of his iuſtice vpon the Chananites, whoſe places he had appointed vnto them, determined to roote out and deſtroy all thoſe inhabitants. Now, euery thing hath a beginning and a training vp euen as ſchellers in the ſchoole and Tradeſmen in their trades. The young beginner is brought from eaſier things to harder, and at the laſt made a Maiſter of his Art: So doth the Lord fit men by degrées for that which he hath appointed them vnto. If hée will in time haue vs to doo any great things, wée muſt begin to doo the leſſe: and if we bée appointed to beare great croſſes, wee muſt beginne to beare little ones: and ſo on on in our appointed warrefare of this life. The good conſideration whereof will make you euer welcome what GOD ſendeth and thinke it is a Degree of his ſchoole. You know not yet what you are appointed for, but follow him, and bée théerefull, the end, I warrant you, ſhall be good. Secondly, by this (as by many other Scriptures) he teacheth his people the lawfulneſſe of warres both defenſiue and offenſiue contrary to fantaſticall ſpirits that talke they know not what. The Magiſtrate beareth not 
                           Rom. 13. 4. 
                           the ſword in vaine, but hath it to defend, and offend, as occaſion ſerueth, that is, to protect the good and to ſmite the euill, Thirdly, to tell vs and his Church euer, that as theſe Iſraelites could not trauell to the earthly Canaan but they muſt fight with Amalech in the way; no

more can we trauell to the heauenly Canaan without battaile giuen to many foes. The Deuill, the World, and the fleſh they are fierce Amalechites: and they muſt be fought with, yea they muſt be ouercome alſo as Amalech was of Iſrael, or els we ſhall neuer ſée Canaan. Pouerty, Sickneſſe, Croſſes by children, by feigned friends, and ſpitefull foes Sclanders and ill reports with infinite more they are Amalechites, and they méete you in your way as you are trauelling towardes the ſpiritual Canaan, they ſtop you, at the leaſt they offer to ſtaie you, ſo that without buckling with them you ſhall not paſſe. At them then in the power of our GOD and faint not, be valiant and of a ſtout courage, He ſtandeth at your backe that is Almighty, and hee ioyeth to ſee you hartie. To Hell a man may ſaile with a forewinde and méete neuer an Amalechite, but not to Heauen. When Iſrael was going to Egypt they met no foes: but when they came from Egypt to goe to Canaan they meete with many. Lazarus, poore Lazarus had a bitter battaile in his way to Heauen: when the Rich-Glutton ſayled ſmoothely to Hell, with neuer a rub in his way, &amp;c. This meditation you may follow further if you will, and be much comforted in it in your croſſes: For they are but Amalechites, and you ſhall ouer come them arriuing ioyfully in the glorious Chanaan prepared for you and all that fight manfully.
                        2 I conſider next what ſhoulde bée the cauſe why theſe Amalechites would fight with the Iſraelites. For as touching bloud, Amalech came of Eliphaz Son of Eſau 
                           Gen. 36. 12. Gen. 32. 28. Gen. 35. 10. by Timna his Concubine, &amp; Eſau and Iacob were brethrē, ſo they were too néere to fight one with an other if all had béene well; Neither is there mention made of any iniurie done of the Iſraelites to Amalech. Nothing then can I finde to bee the cauſe but that which is too common a cauſe ſtill ſtill in the Worlde, euen a bitter enuie at GODS mercies vouchſafed vnto them, and a

                           wicked deſire to haue the ſpoile of them. GOD was gratious vnto the Iſraelites, and had long bene, they could not abide it; and GOD meant to be further gratious, they would preuent it. In a word, God may not doo with his owne what hee liſteth, but if his eye bée good, theirs is euill; though themſelues had fauoures beyond their worth, yet ſpite they that others are fauoured alſo. An old canker in mans heart; for Abel taſted of it ſo long ago at his owne brothers hand: and I would it blemiſhed not in our daies thoſe that ſhould be brethren. Perhaps alſo there was in them naturally a roote of quarreling, iarring, and contending with others, for ſuch rootes there are too déepe ſet in ſome heartes. Men that cannot be quiet, that cannot liue in peace with their neighbours, but that delight in trouble and controuerſies, in ſtrife and debate: and will damnably boaſt that they haue health and growe fat by going to lawe with their bretheren, whereas if they were quiet, they ſhould dye. Men I ſay of this nature, very limmes of Sathan, the world hath euer had, and ſtill hath too many. Now theſe cauſes were all naught, and therfore this warre ill grounded, ill proſpered For enuie I haue often touched it, but if the Lord alſo touch not ſuch hearts, nothing will ſerue. I ſay no more now, but wiſhe they woulde earneſtly think of the Saying of GODS SPIRIT in the Pſalme. The vngodly ſhall ſee it, and gnaſh his teeth. The vngodlie, Pſal. 112. 10. the vngodly be theſe gnaſhers; And Let him that hath eares to heare, heare. For that filthy deſire of hauing from others ſtill, ſtill, that their heape may grow infinite, I wiſſe that Heathen Africanus wel remembred, who when he ſhould haue ioyned with the Prieſt in praying for more and more increaſe to the Romanes, anſwered no no, our ſtate is good all readie and aboundantly rich, I will therefore rather pray that God will keepe it and maintaine it as it is. Surely this man ſhall riſe-vp in Judgment againſt ſuch vnſatiable mindes

and bée a ſwift witneſſe againſt them. The Old Saying is wiſe, enough is enough; and, enough is as good as a feaſt. Mediocria firma, Meane things be firme, when great things be fickle. In Plutarch is mentioned a reaſon why the Kings of Sparta reigned ſo long: namely, becauſe they were content with their owne limit and deſired no more. The thirde vice is as bad as either of theſe, namely, To be vnquiet. And al Books of learning by occaſion ſpeake of the blot it made in that worthy Alexander, when the Scithian Embaſſadours trulie tolde him, That if there were no men to fight &amp; quarrell with all, he would fight with the woods, and the mountaines, and the wilde beaſts. Such an other was Alcibiades, an excellent man many waies, but ſo vnquiet, that the Saying grew, how Graece was not able to beare two Alcibiades. Beware then of theſe cauſes of warre, and contention: and learne by the Rod of GOD vpon Amalech, to liue in peace, and to let Gods children paſſe by vs without trouble. I could héere with iuſt honour remember Her late Maieſties moſt happie gouernment. Her bleſſed contentment with her own, not ſéeking nor deſiring the right of others, no not taking that which was earneſtlie offered vnto Her. In regard whereof ſhe renownedly flouriſhed when other enuious, gréedy, and troubleſome natures fel. But I end this Note here.
                        3 And Moſes ſaide vnto Ioſhua, Chuſe vs out men, 
                           Ver. 9. 
                           and goe and fight with Amalech; wée may obſerue in this the antiquitie of Muſters, and a warrant for them. All did not goe heere, but ſome, and thoſe choſen out by a Muſter and view taken by Ioſhua. Such vſe remaineth ſtill amongſt vs, and in all gouernments els: for it is fit, it is neceſſarie, and I would haue all Menne conſider well how full of honour and credit it euer was in theſe caſes to bee choſen: as contrariewiſe what a blotte it caried often with it to bee omitted: as that either hee was guiltie of ſome fowle vice

or not truſted &amp;c. Then woulde not men run away and hide themſelues as ſoone as they heare of a Muſter towardes, as now a daies they doo. Such baſe mindes and cowardly ſpirits were not wont to bée in Engliſh-men: I would it were amended; for no friende can heare ſuch a one but with bluſhing and ſhame. And againe, it worketh an other great miſchiefe, namelie, to haue our armies that ſtand for God and Religion, for Prince and Countrie to conſiſt of ſuch a ſcumme, as no bleſſing can be expected where ſuch inſtruments are vſed. Non recepiebantur olim mili

                            And with vs hee thinkes himſelfe a Kill-Kowe, that neuer ſawe hoſtem aut caſtra, either enemy or campe: that can better ſkill to ſwagger and ſweare in an Ale-houſe, or in a market-towne, with long ſhagged hayre like a birde of Newgate, than how to ſerue among men like a man. A foule degenerating from the vertue of our Elders and of our Nation. Let it bee vile hereafter to ſuch as taſte of Manhood, or haue true ENGLISH bloud in their hearts.
                        4 To morrow I will ſtand on the top of the hill with

the rodde of GOD in my hand, namely, to praye: for ſo it appeareth he did. Where ſee and Note a religious ioining of godlie Prayer with the meanes of outwarde force. This is no newe thinge, but as olde as Moſes: acceptable to GOD, and very powerfull euer. Aſa did thus, and he was a godlie king. There came out againſt 
                           2. Cron. 14 9. 
                           him the king of Ethiopia
                            or Egypt, with an hoſte of Ten hundreth Thouſand, and three hundreth Charets, (a huge companie.) And Aſa went out before him, and vſed 10. 
                           both theſe waies. Firſt, they ſet the battaile in arraie, withall thoſe things, then ioine they prayer alſo as moſt requiſite. And Aſa cryed vnto the Lord his God, and ſaid, 
                           11. 
                           Lord, it is nothing with thee to helpe with many, or with no power: helpe vs, O Lord our God: for we reſt on thee, and in thy Name are we come out againſt this multitude: O LORD, thou art our God, let not man preuaile againſt thee. Then the Lord ſmote the Ethiopians
                            
                           12. 
                           before Aſa, and before Iudah and the Ethiopians fled &amp;c. Ichoſhaphat did thus and proſpered, his notable 2. Chron. 20. 3. 6. &amp;c. 
                           Prayer is alſo expreſſed. Mauritius did thus againſt the Perſians and proſpered. Our Chronicles tell vs of Oſwald the King of Northumberland how he did the like &amp; proſpered againſt Cedwall. How Ethelred being at prayer, and hearing that his brother Alured was ſhrewdly diſtreſſed in the battaile, yet went on with his prayer and would not ſtirre till he had ended that dutie, after he went and had a notable victorie, and relieued his brother. The men of S. Edmondſburie prayed againſt that cruell Tyrant Swanus, and the Lord heard them, ſmote Swanus that hee died roaring and yelling, and they were deliuered. Edward 3. againſt the French did thus, and proſpered. Many moe might be recited. Wherefore good is that Saying of S. Ambroſe to Gratian, Noſti fide magis Imperatoris, quam virtute militum victoriam queri ſolere, Thou knoweſt that victorie is gotten rather by the faith of the Emperour, than by the valour of the

Souldiers. Both together fight ſtrongly againſt all foes and forces as you ſée. And in this place I pray you well note what followeth.
                        5. And when Moſes helde vp his hand, Iſrael preuailed: 
                           ver. 11. 
                           but when hee let his hands goe downe Amalech preuailed. Thus ſhewed the Lord to all poſteritie and ſuccéeding ages, the force of holy prayer in battell or elſe-where. Surely, ſurely, it is euer with the Lord a preuailing power as ſhall be good for the parties vſing it. Is any ſicke amongſt 
                           Iam. 5. 14. 
                           you? (ſaith S. Iames) let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray for him. &amp;c. And the prayer of faith ſhall ſaue the ſicke, and the Lord ſhall raiſe him vp: 
                           15. 
                           and if he hath cōmitted ſinnes, they ſhall be forgiuen him. For the prayer of a righteous man auaileth much if it be 
                           16. 
                           feruent. Elias was a man ſubiect to like paſſions as we are, and he prayed earneſtly that it might not raine, &amp; it rayned 
                              17. 
                              not on the earth for three yeeres, and ſix moneths. And he prayed againe, and the Heauens gaue raine, &amp; the earth 
                              18. 
                              brought forth her fruit.
                            Agréeable héereunto is that great commendation of prayer in Sirach, Hee heareth the prayer of the oppreſſed. He deſpiſeth not the deſire of the fatherleſſe,

                           15. 
                           and her crie is againſt him that cauſeth them: for from her cheeks they goe vp to Heauen, &amp; the Lord which heareth them, doth accept them. He that ſerueth the Lord ſhall be accepted with fauour, and his prayer ſhall reach vnto the

                           clouds. The prayer of him that humbleth himſelfe goeth 
                           17. 
                           through the clouds, and ceaſeth not till it come neere, and will not depart till the moſt High haue reſpect thereunto to iudge righteouſlie, and execute iudgement. &amp;c. As Dauids Harpe wrought when the euill ſpirit vexed Saul (ſaith a learned man) ſo ſhall thy hartie and zealous prayer quiet thy troubled minde in all diſtreſſes, and comfort thy heart in all aſſaulting feares. Wilt thou be rayſed vp? (ſaith Another,) then firſt caſt thy ſelfe downe in feruent

and humble prayer? For no man is rayſed that firſt is not downe. Ioſhua by prayer obtained to haue the Sunne 
                           Ioſhua. 10. 12. 13. 
                           ſtand ſtill, that hee might haue day enough to ſlay the enemies of the Lord. In the hoſt of M. Aurelius a companie of Chriſtian Souldiers by prayer obtained rayne, when all the hoſt was like to periſh for want of water. They alſo obtained thunderbolts to bee throwne from Heauen in the faces of their foes, and thereon had a name giuen Legio fulminea. them of the ſame. Oratio oranti ſubſidium, Deo ſacrificium, Diabolo flagellum. Prayer
                            therefore to him that prayeth is a helpe, to God a ſacrifice, and to the Deuill a whippe. But ſée our corruption. If wee receaue not what wee pray for at the firſt aſking, wee faint and ceaſe our praying Dum extendebat manus Moſes, praeſe ferebat typum eius qui crucifixus eſt pro nobis. Quemadmodum enim ſeruo extendente manus cecidit Amalech, it a cum Dominus manus extendit, diſſoluta eſt acies Diaboli. Theod. in Exod. ver. 12. ſtreight: not remembring how often wee vſe a medicine for the body before wee can bee whole, how manie ſtrokes an Oake muſt haue before it will fall, and how we ouer and ouer, againe and againe, plough our land and delue our Gardens, to reape and gather fruite from them. Let vs then amend this fault in our prayer héereafter: and neuer forget the force of true and godlie prayer in time. Whileſt Moſes held vp his hands (that is, continued praying) ſo long Ioſhua and the Iſraelites, whō he prayed for, preuailed. But when he gaue ouer, the enemie preuailed. Thus ſhall it be in your caſe, and in my caſe, and all others that be troubled.
                        6. But Moſes hands were heauie: therefore they tooke aſtone and put vnder him, and hee ſate vpon it: And Aaron and Hur ſtayed vp his hands, the one on the one ſide, and the other on the other ſide, ſo his handes were ſteadie vnto the going downe of the Sunne. And Ioſhua diſcomfited

                            This heauineſſe of Moſes handes may teach vs the weakenes of all fleſh in Chriſtian exerciſes. Wee cannot holde out and continue as we ought, but heauines and dulneſſe will ſteale vpon vs, and ſéeke to coole vs and hinder vs. The helpe that Aaron and Hur performed vnto him may teach

us the benefit of Chriſtian companie in ſuch holy exerciſes, and the néedefull dutie of praying for him that prayeth for Ministri

                            vs, that God would be with his ſpirit, that is, ſtrengthen him and quicken him and ayde him, ſo to pray &amp; ſo to continue his prayers, as the end may be to his glorie and our comfort. In regard whereofour Booke of Common prayer hath that anſwere: And with thy ſpirit. The outward geſture may héere alſo be noted, which you ſhall finde in the Scriptures to be diuers. Salomon knéeled, Ezekias turned to the wall, Chriſt fell prone vpon his face, the Publican 
                           1. Kings. 8. 54. knocked vpon his breaſt, and héere Moſes lifteth vp his hands. All which geſtures pleaſe God as long as they ariſe from zeale and truth within, and are not hypocriticall. And what the Cuſtome of the Church wherein we liue eſtabliſheth and vſeth, wiſe &amp; peaceable perſons will kéepe and follow.
                        7. Laſtly, the Lord commaundeth them to write this for a remembrance in a Booke. And Moſes built an Altar, 
                           ver. 14. ver. 15. 
                           &amp;c. All this hath vſe to tell vs howe carefull wee muſt be in keeping a Regiſter in our hearts of Gods mercies and fauours towards vs in our ſelues, in our friends, in our Countrie, in our Magiſtrates, and Miniſters, or any way. The point hath béene touched héeretofore, when we ſpake of Manna: and therefore I paſſe it ouer nowe: but I pray you remember Examples in this caſe and followe them, Deborah, Iudith, Heſter, Anna, Mary, Toby, the one cleanſed Leaper that returned to giue thanks, the Iſraelites when they paſſed ouer the Red Sea, &amp;c, for all theſe built Altars in their hearts for Gods fauours, by being truly and feruently thankfull. The earth rendreth the Huſbandman her fruite for his paines beſtowed on her; ſo doth the Horſe and Oxe their labour for the meate which they haue giuen them. How much more ſhould man remember what he receaueth, and be thankfull to his good God? But I ſtay héere. Theſe thinges may yéeld you a taſte of the vſe of this Chapter if you will now reade ouer

the Text againe and obſerue the particulars: for what is my deſire, but to worke a liking of reading the Text, by ſhewing ſome fruite which we may receaue when we are deſtitute of better teaching?
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. 18.
                     
                        
                           In this Chapter we haue two generall Heads.
                           
                              The comming of Iethro to his ſonne in law Moſes.
                              
                              And the appointing of more Iudges to heare cauſes.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        1. COncerning the firſt, the Text ſaith, When Iethro the Prieſt of Midian, Moſes Father in law heard all that 
                           ver. 1. 
                           God had done for Moſes, and for Iſrael his people, and howe the Lord had brought Iſrael out of Egypt, Then hee tooke Zipporah
                            
                           ver. 2. 
                           Moſes wife, &amp;c, and went vnto him.
                            Thereby noting that the hearing of Gods great and wonderfull workes done for his people mooued his heart to come and ioyne himſelfe to them, ſo entereth God to the heart by the eare vſuallie. And therefore the vſe of the eare to heare of God and his workes, out of his word, euer cried for in the Scriptures: and the ſtopping of the ſame euer condemned, as to GOD rebellions, and to the ſoule moſt hurtfull and pernitious. O that it might ſinke and ſettle in all men, for their amendment and encreaſe of care and conſcience to heare.
                        
                        2. What is Iethro? A Gentile. Where dwelt hee? In Midian, a good way of. Gentiles then heare, and Iewes will not; they that dwell farre of come, and they that are néere will not. He that but heareth is much mooued, they that ſée with their eyes, and féele with their hands Gods works and mercies, murmure &amp; repine ſinfully. Doo not

things fall out thus in our dayes? and finde wee not by erperience, to the griefe of all good mindes, that plentie is no daintie? would GOD wee did not. But let vs in time remember what is ſpoken for our admonition if wee haue grace: Manie ſhall come from the Eaſt, and Weſt, 
                           Math. 8. 11.

                           woe be to thee Bethſaida: for if the great workes which were done in you, had beene done in Tyrus and Sidon, they had repented long agone in ſackcloath and aſhes. The Queene of the South ſhall riſe in iudgement

                           with this generation, and ſhall condemne it: for ſhe came from the vttermoſt parts of the earth, to heare the wiſedome of Salomon: and beholde a greater than Salomon is heere. Then Chriſt in his perſon, now Chriſt in his word, the ſame Chriſt God and man, euer aboue Salomon who was his creature.
                        3. Iethro brought with him Moſes wife whom he had ſent away, and her two ſonnes. (ver. 3.) The time when hee ſent her away I doo not remember to be expreſſed in the Scripture. But of like it was when ſhee ſhewed her ſelfe ſo croſſe and weyward about the circumciſion of her ſonne, to the hazard of Moſes owne life, whom the Lord would haue killed for neglect of the Sacrament. Happily Chap. 4. 24. he thought ſhee would be croſſe and headie in other things as well as in that; and therefore for feare leſt ſhee ſhould hinder him in his vocation now impoſed by God, he ſent her for a time back with his Children to Iethro her father. Whereof we may make, me thinks, theſe two vſes; firſt, that it is a gréeuous offence for either wiues or others to be an hinderance to men in their duties enioyned them by God; for this is euen to ſtriue againſt God, and to ſet our will againſt his will, to the great perill both of the men ſo called, and of the parties that ſo hinder them if they perſiſt.

                           Secondly, that it is the dutie of all ſo called to remoue from them in a lawfull ſort thoſe hinderers: preferring the Lords worke, before their owne affection and remembring zealouſlie their Maiſters wordes, Hee that loueth 
                           Math. 10. 37. 
                           Father, or Mother, more than mee, is not worthie of mee. And hee that loueth Sonne, or Daughter more than me, is not worthie of me. But whoſoeuer ſhall forſake 
                           Math. 19. 29. 
                           houſes, or Bretheren, or Siſters, or Father, or Mother, or Wife, or Children, or Lands, for my names ſake, he ſhall receaue an hundreth fold more, and ſhall inherite eternall life. This forſaking for a time of Moſes was a holie reſiſtance of his owne affections, and a zealous care of his impoſed office.
                        4. And Iethro ſaide to Moſes
                            (that is, hee ſent meſſengers ver. 6. to ſay) I thy Father in lawe Iethro am come to thee, and thy Wife, and thy two Sonnes with her. A ſingular modeſtie in Iethro, and reuerence to his Sonne in lawe Moſes his place: when albeit hee had with him thoſe gueſts that hee knew in nature muſt néedes be welcome, beſides his owne due who was come ſo farre in loue and kindnes: yet hee would not come to him without this reuerent ſending before to acquaint him. Such reuerence to mens places in our daies is much wanting in thoſe that chiefely ſhould performe it; and familiaritie breedeth contempt. But behold Iethro héere, and know that God hath Chronicled this for his praiſe, and our profit. Reuerence to Magiſtrates, reuerence to Miniſters, reuerence to all authoritie and ſuperioritie, certainly it pleaſeth God, and commendeth vs. The contrarie is immodeſtie, yea impietie, and as a great contempt of the Author of that authoritie, as of the partie contemned, vſuallie puniſhed of God either with want of euer hauing authoritie, or with ſuch contempt if they haue authoritie, as erſt they meaſured vnto others.
                        5. Howe requiteth Moſes this kinde reſpect? The Text ſaith. Hee went out to meete his Father in lawe, and 
                           ver. 7.
                           
                           did obeyſance and kiſſed him, and each asked other of his welfare; and they came into the Tent. No authoritie and greatnes maketh him proude or vnmindfull of an olde friend, who had ſhewed him kindnes when he was in a lower eſtate: but with a ſingular humilitie he receaueth reuerence in his place, and with like reſpect againe boweth himſelfe and reuerenceth Iethro. Such mutuall loue and reciprocall offices of complement and order ſhall you euer ſée in wiſe men, what difference ſoeuer is in their places. And there is no greater pride than where leaſt worth is. Pride maketh rude, and rudenes getteth little loue, wee all knowe. Such an Example as this, is in ſteade of an hundred to a wiſe heart; and yet you may ioyne Dauids proteſtation to it &amp; be much profited, Lord I am not high minded, I haue no proud lookes, &amp;c.
                        
                        6. Then Moſes told his Father in law all that the Lord had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians, &amp;c. Being met Ver. 8. together, after ordinarie ſalutations and kinde enquiring one of anothers health, they fall to religious and godlie talke: Moſes taking pleaſure to ſpeake, &amp; Iethro to heare of ſuch gracious fauours as the Lord had ſhewed to his people, and of ſuch powerfull iudgements as he had laide vpon their enemies. Which may ſerue for a good motiue in our daies to cut off idle, if not very prophane conference when wee méete, and to leade vs this good way; remembring euer, that of idle words wee muſt giue an accompt. Woe be to the world becauſe of offences: for it 
                           Math. 12. 36. Math. 18. 7. 
                           muſt needes be that offences muſt come, but woe bee to that man by whom the offence commeth, &amp;c. If any man among you ſeeme religious, &amp; refraineth not his tongue, 
                           Iam. 1. 26. 
                           but deceaueth his owne heart, this mans religion is in vaine. The hartie ioy alſo that was in Iethro when hee heard theſe thinges, notablie telleth vs the right affection of a Childe of GOD, when GOD is mercifull to his Church or to any member therefore; hee enuieth not, hee grudgeth not, much leſſe ſpeaketh ill, but with

a very louing ioy hee is glad and bleſſeth the Name of the Lord for it. A thing, I feare me, much wanting now a-daies, not onely in Country Chriſtians, and men (as wee ſay) of the Laitie endued with leſſe knowledge, but euen in ſuch as be Great men in the Church and of the Clergie. The olde Saying was, Laici infesti Clericis. But in our daies, I feare, a Clergie mans chiefe enemies are they of his owne coate. Such is the rancour and poyſoned enuie of theſe times. God in mercie alter it: and make our hearts like Iethro his heart heere. Gratitude againe to God for his mercies is heere taught by Iethro, which is euer a dutie due from man: and which being performed moueth him to giue more. For as Ambroſe ſaith, Gratiarum actio est ad plus dandum inuitatio. Thanksgiuing is a mouing of the Lord to beſtowe more. As ingratitude, out of doubt, worketh the taking away of thinges giuen. It is written of one Timotheus, the ſonne of Conon a verie good Father a Citizen of Athens, that after hee had proudly ſaid in a great aſſemblie, Haec Ego feci, non Fortuna, This I haue done, and not Fortune, hee neuer after proſpered in any thing, but daily loſt that glorie which before he had gotten. Much more faultie are they, that at leaſt in heart, (though by mouth they dare not openly ſay ſo,) thinke that this, or that, they haue gotten or done, and not God. You may thinke of that in Daniel. 4. 27. and euer pray againſt ſuch pride.
                        7. Then Iethro Moſes father in lawe tooke burnt offerings and ſacrifices to offer vnto God. And Aaron and all 
                           ver. 12. 
                           the Elders of Iſrael came to eate bread with Moſes father in lawe before God. Hauing béene thankfull in wordes now he addeth deedes, that both wordes and déedes may goe together in honouring God. For A dead faith, ſaith Iam. 2 17. Rom. 10. 10. S. Iames, is that, where workes want. And as with the heart we beleeue vnto righteouſnes, ſo with the mouth we confeſſe vnto ſaluation, ſaith S. Paul. If wee learne of Iethro, euer to ioyne theſe together as the Lord ſhall enable

vs, wée ſhall rightlie and fully giue aſſurance both to our ſelues and others of our true faith. This ſhewed againe, that Iethro worſhipped the true God, otherwiſe (in likelihoode) Moſes would not haue married his daughter. And if Iethro here, and Melchiſedek, and Naaman and Cornelius with others mentioned elſewhere in the Scriptures did ſo, hauing, for any thing wée know, ſmall preaching or meanes of true knowledge beſides the working Spirit of a gratious GOD that mercifully pulled them out of the fire: Let vs comfortably hope of our Forefathers liuing in the time of ignorance, that they found mercie with God. And yet beware that wée reaſon not from thence to any contempt or neglect of that bleſſed light which God vouchſafeth now aboue thoſe times. But euer remēber that ſingular Spéech of Saint Cyprian, Ignoſci potuit ſimpliciter errantibus, poſt inſpirationem vero
                            
                           Cypr. Epiſt. 63 
                           et reuelationem factam, qui in eo quo errauerat perſeuerat, ſine venia ignorantiae peccat, praeſumptione enim et obſtinatione ſuperatur. Mercy might be ſhewed to them that erred of ſimplicitie, but after light graunted who ſhall ſo continue in his error, he ſinneth without hope of pardon, beeing ouercome with preſumption and obſtinacie.
                            The kinde comming of the Elders with Aaron, to eate and bée merrie with Moſes Father in law, ſheweth their loue to Moſes and was a great comfort. Alike cuſtome we haue to giue a man his welcome (as we call it) with wine or meate as wée thinke good, which you ſée is commendable béeing vſed rightly. For moſt good and ioyful it euer was, when men togeather agrée in loue and vnitie. Many ſharp ſhowers Moſes was vnder with theſe Iſraelites; yet here is loue and kindneſſe, which telleth vs GOD will not euer grieue his ſeruants, Magiſtrates or Miniſters or others faithfull, but hath his times to comfort them alſo, and mingle ſweete with their ſowre, that they may be able 1. Cor. 10. to beare and to go along with their vocation. A ſwéete goodneſſe in him ſo to conſider our weakeneſſe, ſo to temper

things to our ſtrength, and let it worke a loue in vs of ſo deare a Father and to a godly carriage in all ſtormes. For cloudes will blow ouer, and after a foule day commeth a fayre. Sorrow at night, ioye ere day, ſaith the experienced Pſa. 30. 5. Prophet Dauid, and the Lord in mercy giue vs the vſe of all his ſwéete comforts.

                           Morning to Euen, &amp;c. Amongeſt the infinite mercies of God vouchſafed to mankind, this is one great one, that he hath appointed Gouernment &amp; Gouernours, Iudgment, Iudges, Iuſtice, and Lawes to defend the good, and repreſſe the euill and vnruly. In the 11. Chapter of the Prophet Zach. 11. 7. 
                           Zacharie, he calleth it a Staffe, and a Staffe of beautie for the excellencie of it. I tooke vnto me, ſaith the Lord, two Staues; the one I called Beautie, the other I called Bands, and I fed the ſheepe. The firſt ſtaffe was the Gouernment Eccleſiaſticall and ciuill which hee eſiabliſhed amongſt them, called I ſay Beautie for the profit, comfort &amp; good that commeth euer by Gouernment. His ſecond Staffe was peace, vnitie and concord moſt mercifully alſo vouchſafed vnto them, which béeing indéede a notable holdfaſt of happineſſe in any ſtate, he calleth it by the name of Bands. And both theſe excellent mercies he calleth by the name of Staues, becauſe they haue fit reſemblances with thoſe Shepeheard Staues that are vſed in féeding and tending the flockes of men. For to ſpeake of Gouernmēt wherto the Text leadeth me, the Shepeheards Staffe is ſaid to be a Staffe of directiō, a ſtaffe of correction, a Staffe

                           of defence, &amp; a ſtaffe of ſupport or eaſe: Euen ſo is good &amp; iuſt Gouernment if you marke it. For it directeth a man willing to liue in order, what he ſhal doo, &amp; what hée ſhall not doo, as the Staffe guideth the ſheepe in the right way &amp;

kéepeth him from the wrong. It correcteth him that will not be ruled. It defendeth the oppreſſed and wronged, &amp; it is a ſure ſtay to leane and reſt vpon, when we are toyled with heard dealings of men, as the ſtaffe is for the ſhepeheard to ſupport him when hée is wearie. Uery fitlie therefore reſembled to a ſtaffe, and for the excellencie tearmed not beautifull in the concrete, but verie beautie it ſelfe in the abſtract. Which Beautie that it may the more appeare vnto you, thinke with your ſelfe of theſe points or heads. Firſt, what Names are giuen to Gouernours in the holy Scriptures &amp; holy writings of wiſe men. They are called, you know, Gods, Nurſing-fathers, Nurſing-mothers, the 2. Pet. 2. 10. Patres patriae. patres populi. praeſidentes iuſtitiae. Vindices innocentiae. Cuſtodes patirae. 
                           Miniſters of God, Shepheards, &amp; ſuch like, they are called ye 
                           Fathers of the Countrie, Fathers of the people, the Preſidents of Iuſtice, the manteiners of innocencie; the preſeruers, of peace, and ſuch like, al to make vs ſee the Beautie of this ſtaffe. Secondly, obſerue with your ſelfe ye courſe of God ſetled in all his creatures; for in the ſtarres, in the beaſtes, in the birdes, in the fiſhes, in the trees &amp;c, the Lord hath made ſome chiefer than others, that we might riſe vp therby into a profitable Meditation how beautiful a thing order, degrees, and gouernment is among men, and eſpeciallie a monarchie when one ruleth ouer all, for as Saint Hierom well noteth among the Bees there is one chiefe; &amp; the Cranes in flying follow one. Rome when it was built could not indure two to rule as chiefe although they were brethren, and therfore had her beginning in brothers blood. In Rebeccas womb euen two brethren &amp; twins did ſtriue.

                           duction Plures in adminiſtratione, vnus in dignitate. of that people: one Dauid, one Salomon, &amp; ſo forth. Thirdly, thinke of the commandements giuen in the word to obey Gouernment, and to honour with all dutie &amp; reuerence men placed ouer vs in authoritie, and ſée in them plainely how beautiful God eſteemeth them, than whoſe iudgment and wiſedome there is no greater. Fourthly,
                           
duly conſider that Note which the Scripture giueth often of all wickedneſſe and miſchiefe abounding, becauſe there was no King in Iſrael; and of that in Eſay. 3. 5. 2. ſo fearefull. Fiftly, meditate of that reſemblance that is vſually made of Gouernment to a Ioyners inſtrumēt, whereby if a boord be warped and caſt a ſide, or a wrie, adding heat to it, he can make it ſtreight againe and fit for his vſe. To a wreſt of a muſicall Inſtrument bringing the ſtrings that are out of tune into tune againe. Doo not theſe things ſhew the neceſſity, vſe and comfort of it? Laſtly, the reſemblance to the ſtate of our bodies, wherein the firſt qualities of heat, colde, drineſſe and moiſture being contraries and diſagreeing one with another, yet by order, preportion and a due temperature they are ſo agréed as they make an excellent creature. So doth Gouernment compoſe things moſt croſſe, &amp; make a ſwéete harmonie in loue and peace. In déede therefore a Staffe of beautie is Gouernment either in publique or priuate as in Salomons houſe, and they vnworthie of life among men that will not ſtoope to it, be ruled by it, &amp; bleſſe God for it euermore. The vſe of Gouernment is more than of bread, water, ſunne, ayre, &amp;c. of which yet what vſe haue we? for the benefit of Gouernment is not to make vs breathe onely, and to eate &amp; drinke and be nouriſhed, (which all yet it doth in that it maketh vs liue together ſociablie;) but it farther prouideth, that Idolatry, ſacriledgies, blaſphemies, &amp; other offences againſt GOD doo not ſpread themſelues among the people, that publique peace be not broken, that euery man enioy his owne in ſafety, that trade and traficke be preſerued among men, honeſtie &amp; vertue be defended, &amp;c. They that ſay vnder the olde Teſtament it was néedfull, but not for the perfection of the Goſpel, ſhew no ſuch perfection but that Magiſtrates are néedefull to make them better, &amp; forget that the Pſalme doth not bid Rulers lay away their offices, but to kiſſe the Sonne, that is, to be ſubiect to Chriſt, yt he may Pſal. 2. 12. rule ouer them, and be aboue all as he ought to be. And the

Prophet Eſay dooth not ſay yt in the time of ye 
                           Goſpell there muſt be no Kings or Quéenes, but plainely otherwiſe that they both ſhalbe, and to the Church they ſhalbe profitable and comfortable, euen Nurcing-Fathers and Nurcing-mothers, Eſay 49. 23. And the holy Apoſtle expreſly cōmandeth, that praiers and ſupplications be made for them, that 
                           1 Tim. 2. 2. 
                           we may by the bleſſing of their gouernment lead a godlie &amp; quiet life vnder them. Wherefore you ſée the groſneſſe of this error, andhow bound we are to God for Magiſtracie euen now in the time of the new Teſtamēt, aſwel as others were that liued in ye time of the Old. Now this meditatiō
                            yt they are Gods Deputies &amp; Uicegerēts, Gods Miniſters &amp; Subſtitutes héere on earth, how many good things dooth it teach Magiſtrates &amp; Gouernours? It cheereth them vp againſt all the difficulties of their places which ſurely are many, &amp; ſo many, as he ſaid wel that ſaid it. Who ſo knew the cares annexed to a Kings Crowne, would ſcarce take it vp if it lay before him. They are euen like goodly trees vnder which in the time of a ſtorme euery man will runne with haſt to be ſhielded &amp; ſhadowed from the tempeſt; but as ſoone as the ſtorme is paſt, caſt ſtones at it &amp; breake the boughes of it at their pleaſure. It ſtirreth them vp moſt effectutally to integritie, wiſdome, méekeneſſe, continencie and innocencie. For vpon what hope ſhall they admit iniquitie into their Tribunall-ſeat which they learne and know to be the Throne of God? How ſhall they dare to pronounce a wrong ſentence with that mouth which they learne and know to bée appointed Gods inſtrument for truth? How ſhall they ſubſcribe wicked acts with that hand which God hath appointed to write his acts? No, no, it wil and ought, as I ſay, ſtir-vp to good: euen by al means to indeauoure to ſhew ſome reſemblance in their place of heauenly prouidence, watchfulneſſe, goodneſſe, loue, iuſtice &amp;c. This did Moſes and Iehoſhaphat think when they mooued the Iudges with this Admonition, That they executed not the iudgments of man, but of God; and therefore 2 Cron. 19. 6. ſhould take héed &amp;c. Read the places your ſelfe I pray you,

                              aw of God forbiddeth to kill, and yet to puniſh killers the Lord putteth the ſword into the Magiſtrates hand. Afflict and hurt the godly wée may not, but this is neither to afflict nor hurt, to puniſh by the Lords commandement thoſe that doo afflict and hurt. For Magiſtrates (ſaith the Apoſtle) beare not the ſword in vaine, Rom. 13. Non eſt crudelis qui crudeles iugulat, licet patientibus talis videatur; ſed qui malos percutit in eo quod mali ſunt, miniſter Dei eſt. Hee is not cruell that killeth thē which are cruel, although he ſeeme ſo to them that ſuffer; but who ſo ſtriketh the euill for that they bee euill (meaning, by lawfull authority) He is the Miniſter of God, ſaith S. Hierom. And againe; Homicidas, 
                           Hierō. in Eſay 13 In Ezech. ib. 4. In Iere. 22. 
                           ſacrilegos, et venereos punire, non eſt effuſioſanguinis, ſedlegū miniſterium. To puniſh murderers, ſacrilegious, &amp; licentious perſons is not ſhedding of bloud, but the miniſtery of law.

                            For vnder the gouernment of the Emperour Nerua it was rightly ſaide: It is ill dwelling vnder a king or Magiſtrate where nothing is lawfull, but it is far worſe dwelling vnder one where all things are lawfull. For the duty of Subiects towards their Gouernoures, it is firſt to thinke moſt reuerently of their places as an authoritie appointed of God for our good: and not as ſome men doo, outwardly to obey them and inwardly to thinke them but neceſſarie euils. For S. Peters words teach more when 1. Pet. 2 17. he ſaith, Honour the King, and Salomon when he biddeth, Feare God and the King. For in the word Honour, Peter includeth ſinceram &amp; candidam exiſtimationem: A ſincere and vnſeigned reuerence of them.
                            And Salomon ioyning the King with God, ſheweth a holy and reuerent regard of him to be due to him from men ſubiect to him. That alſo in Paul hath great efficacie in it, Not for feare, but for conſcience ſake. As if he ſhould ſay: euen becauſe Rom. 13. 5. what dutie is done or left vndone to them, is done or left vndone to God himſelfe from whom their authoritie and power is. Whatſoeuer therefore the perſon is, the calling is of God and muſt be ſo thought of. Againe, after this inward reuerent conceipt muſt follow outward obedience to their Lawes, in paying tribute and vndergoing what to vs by them is appointed either for publique defēſe or otherwiſe. For, let euery ſoule be ſubiect to the higher 
                           Rom. 3. 1. 2. 
                           powers ſaith the Apoſtle, becauſe he that reſiſteth, reſiſteth to his owne damnation. And read Tit. 3. 1. 1. Pet. 2. 13. The Magiſtrate may ſometimes be weake, but God wil euer be ſtrong to puniſh any cōtempt of his ordinance. In no caſe therefore may we intrude our ſelues into their offices and meddle with publique matters without a calling. For this is not to obey them, but to rule with them. What is amiſſe to them muſt be ſignified, and their helpe

expected, vnleſſe they appoint vs, and then are wée not priuate perſons any more, but publique for ſuch buſineſſe. And as Counſellers are ſaide to be eyes and eares to the King, ſo are other ſubiects his hands when he pleaſeth to commaund them ſo. And be they neuer ſo euill, yet their place is of God by whom only kings doo rule either Dan. 2. 21. &amp; 37. to our good in his mercie, or to our puniſhment in his iuſtice. Permittuntur aliquando tyrannorum imperia a deo in vindictam malefactorum, praemium vero bonorum. Tyrants

Looke vpon Moſes in this place.
                        3. And as Iuſtice is a bleſſing, ſo are good lawes &amp; ordinances in a kingdom, in the praiſe whereof much might be ſaid, as not a litle againſt idle, ſuperfluous, &amp; hurtful lawes, againſt obſcure &amp; deceitful penning of them, leauing holes &amp; gaps in them, for all ye good intended by them to run out at and neuer be ſéen: but I leaue it to your owne meditation.

Let Moſes modeſty in yéelding, make our ſpirits humble in like occaſion, where God dwelleth it will be ſo, &amp; pride is a ſure ſigne of an ill heart.

The firſt is Courage or an inuincible cōſtancie, wherewith al ſuch as are in authority ouer others to miniſter iuſtice &amp; iudgment vnto them ought to be endued, to the end yt neither by loue or hatred they encline

more to one or other than ſtandeth with the right of their place, and to the end that neither with flattering prayſes, or bitter backbitings of men giuen to tempt the good diſpoſition of ſuch Gouernours, they be moued and drawne aſide, diſcouraged or ſet downe in the worke of their Calling, but what is iuſt and right that ſoundly and reundly they doo, miniſtring iuſtice to all without feare or fainting, looking to him that muſt iudge them, and who will aſſuredlie reward their well doing, and iuſtly puniſh all their deprauers and hinderers. In the Booke of Chronicles we reade it for no ſmall blemiſh in a King, and no ſmall rod to the people vnder him that Rehoboam the ſonne and ſucceſſor of Salomon was but a childe, meaning in heart and courage, 2. Chron. 13. 7. that is (in déede) weake and faint harted, and ſo could not reſiſt thoſe vaine and wicked men which made themſelues ſtrong againſt him. Therefore God willed Ioſhua to be ſtrong and of a moſt valiant courage. A good Exhortation Ioſua. 1. 7. gaue Dauid to Salomon his Sonne, ſaying, Be ſtrong and ſhew thy ſelfe a man; for I goe the way of all 
                           1. King. 2. 2. 
                           the earth, &amp;c. Such godly fortitude was in the Apoſtle when he ſaide, Wee are reuiled and yet we bleſſe; wee are 
                           1. Cor. 4. 12. 12. 
                           perſecuted, and ſuffer it. Wee are euill ſpoken of, and we pray: &amp;c. Meaning, that hee gaue not ouer or fainted in his dutie for all theſe thinges. The ſecond is the feare of God, a vertue alſo moſt requiſite in Iudges, for héereupon hang all vertues, as might at large be ſhewed if it were néedefull. But let that Example of Abraham ſuffice, who thinking that the feare of God was not in Gerar, vtterly Gen. 20. 11. deſpaired of any other vertue, and therefore mooued his wife to ſay ſhee was his ſiſter. In this reſpect the feare of God is both by Dauid and Salomon called, the beginning of wiſedome; that is, the roote and fountaine of all goodnes, and therefore of all Juſtice and true Judgement in Judges. The third is a loue of truth and true dealing; for who more than Iudges ſhould be frée in themſelues, and abhorre in all others traude and deceipt, lying and falſe

witnes bearing, by which all Iuſtice muſt néedes be ouer-throwne, the wicked iuſtified, and the haltar put about the true mans necke to the great offence of God, &amp; the fearefull puniſhment of the Iudge, that not louing truth, or not ſo carefull for it as he ought, hath ſuffered ſuch iniquitie to be done? The laſt is, that Iudges be haters of Couetouſnes the plague and poyſon of all Iuſtice, as might be ſhewed by much proofe, were I willing to ſtand vpon ſo knowne a Common place. It ſtoppeth eyes, it ſtoppeth eares, it tieth tongues, and worketh wonders wofull and hatefull, &amp;c. To men of this ſort, that is, endued with theſe vertues aboue ſaide, authoritie happily (and to the great good of many thouſands) is giuen, and God for his mercie ſake encreaſe the number of them. In Deutro. theſe things will come to be ſpoken of againe, and therefore I am here the ſhorter.
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. 19.
                     
                        AT this Chapter beginneth the ſecond part of this Booke of Exodus, wherein you haue theſe points. Firſt, a Preparation of the people to heare the lawes of God, deliuered by God himſelfe to them, for the gouernment of their liues and actions, and that is in this 19. Chapter. Secondly, the Lawes them ſelues in the next Chapter. Thirdly, other Lawes tending to the explication of theſe 10. principall Lawes, called the 10. Commaundements: together with the puniſhments of the tranſgreſſors, Chap. 21. 22. and 23. Fourthly, Moſes aſcending vp to the Mount, firſt with the Elders, after without them all alone, and his receauing direction for the Tabernacle, and the worſhip of God, Chap. 24. vnto

the 32. Fiftly, the ſinne of the people, their puniſhment and Moſes prayer for them to the 35. Chap. where certaine lawes are alſo repeated. Laſtly, the building of the Tabernacle, the gifts giuen, the finiſhing, erection, and dedication to the end of the Booke.
                     The Preparation is generall and particular. The generall hath firſt an Argument drawne from the authoritie of the ſpéech, to wit, that Moſes did not commaund out of his owne bead, but was called vp to the Mount to God, and ver. 3. there was required to ſay to the houſe of Iacob and to tell the children of Iſrael, &amp;c. Secondly, an argument drawne from the former benefits of God to them, in theſe words, Yee haue ſeene what I did to the Egyptians, and how I caried 
                        Ver. 4. 
                        you vpon Eagles wings, and haue brought you vnto me. Thirdly, an Argument from future benefits, If you will heare my voice indeede, and keepe my couenant, then 
                        ver. 5. 
                        you ſhall be my chiefe treaſure aboue all people, though all the earth be mine: Yee ſhall be to me a Kingdome of 
                        ver. 6. 
                        Prieſts, and an holy Nation. All which if you will applie vnto your ſelfe and make vſe of them, then may you in like ſort euer ſtir vp your hart and prepare your minde to good things, in this ſort, and by the ſelfe ſame Arguments. As for Example, to goe to the Church and to ioyne with the Congregation both in prayer &amp; hearing of the word preached. Firſt, becauſe it is not mans Cōmandement, but God requireth the Miniſter to call &amp; ſpeake to you for it, as here he did Moſes. Secondly, the fauours of God paſſed to you require it. Thirdly, future fauors (if you do it) ſhal be added vnto you. It is alſo worthy marking ſtill, how he ioyneth here hearing &amp; keeping together, ſaying, If you will heare my voyce indeede, and keepe my couenant. Keepe without hearing you cannot, &amp; hearing without keeping will neuer profit you or any. Joyned therefore you ſée they muſt néedes be, as the Lord ſhall make vs able.
                     
                        Moſes doing as God bad him, teacheth all Miniſters to bee faithfull, and to doo their Meſſage. Many are the ver. 7.
                        
Commaundements in Scripture to them to ſpeake, to crie, to lift vp their voyces like trumpets, and to tell their people what God requireth. If they doo it, great is their reward with God, and if they bee falſe, and idle, and negligent, men-pleaſers, and time-ſeruers, as great againe is their iudgement. Grandis est dignitas ſacerdotum, &amp; grandis est ruina, ſi peccant. Great is the dignitie of Prieſts by their office, and as great is the fall of them, if they offend. It can neuer be too often repeated, nor too much remembred.
                     The peoples aunſwere to Moſes what is it? They anſwered 
                        ver. 8. 
                        all together and ſaid, all that the Lord hath commaunded wee will doo. A moſt notable patterne for a Chriſtian congregation to looke vpon, and to followe. Thus ſhould it be betwixt Paſtor and People euer. Hee to ſpeake what God commaundeth, and they to heare &amp; anſwere zealouſly, we will, we will doo what God commandeth vs. O ſwéete ioy where this agreement is! Such care and ſuch conſcience both in paſtor and people, will giue no place to iarres and contentions, to ſutes and vexations, or to any thing that diſpleaſeth God, and is offenſiue to the world, &amp;c.
                     2. The particular preparation followeth, frō the 9. verſe to ye end of the Chapter, hauing 4 members. Firſt, the maner of Gods Communicating of himſelfe to Moſes,
                         namely, in a thick cloud, together with ye end thereof, that the people 
                        ver. 9. 
                        may heare, whileſt I talke with thee, and that they may beleeue thee for euer. A ſingular inſtruction to all men in the world, that deſire to pleaſe God: and eſpecially to Great Ones, ſhewing them how carefull they ſhould be to grace and countenance the Miniſters of the word before the people, to the end their wordes may haue more weight with their hearers, and their ſeruice and paines doo more good. Would men doo thus, O how comfortable to the painfull and faithfull Teacher, and how profitable to the Church would it bee? The Lord would ſée it and acknowledge

it done for him, and with eternall comforts reward it for euer. But now it is otherwiſe with too many. For Great men muſt ſhewe their greatnes in diſgracing the Lords Prophets, and meaner men muſt ſhewe their malice in ſpreading falſe rumors of their ſpirituall Teachers in open aſſemblies and priuate conuenticles: motes are made mountaines, and ſpots ſurmiſed where none are. Neuer I thinke ſince the world was, did mens eares ſo itch and their hearts ſo boile in this ſinne, as at this day. But what ſhall wee ſay? Surely, euen turne to the Lord in prayer, and comfort our ſelues in this example of the Lords goodnes, who as hee is not Moſes his God alone, nor Moſes alone his meſſenger: ſo will not he tye his countenance onlie to him, but giue euery true labourer in his good time his due credite, notwithſtanding all the malice of man and Deuill. O Lord doo it for thy Name ſake, and as thou gracedſt héere Moſes that hee might euer be beléeued, ſo couuert or confound theſe Diſgracers of thy Miniſters; whoſe iniquitie tendeth to hinder Beleefe, and conſequentlie to deſtroy the ſoules of thy poore people. Encreaſe the number of them that followe thy example, and labour by all meanes to further thy worke in the hands of thy workemen. Set a Crowne of glory vpon their heads: and dailie reward their loue into their boſomes with thy good bleſſings vnto them and theirs.
                     3. The ſecond branch of this particular preparation is laid downe in the 10. verſe, and the reſt following to the 16. conſiſting in certaine outward matters vſed in thoſe times among thoſe people: and figuratiuely teaching inward puritie and cleanenes of heart to come to God with all. As waſhing of their cloathes, not comming at their wiues, and ſuch like. The Ceremonies are taken away, but the ver. 14. ver. 15. 
                        truth remaineth, namely, that we are all by our corruption moſt vnfit, profitably to heare the word of God, vnleſſe we be ſanctified and prepared thereunto by the good Spirit of God. And therefore we ought to make readie for ſo holy

a worke by all due care before hand, &amp; to purge our hearts from other cares, troubles, and impediments whatſoeuer. The word of GOD is not to be handled with vncleane hands, neither will enter into vncleane hearers. It is a precious pearle, it ſhould not be caſt before Swine. For this cauſe aſſuredly many heare and reade without profit, becauſe they came without feare and reuerence in their mindes. This abſtaining from their wiues, noteth no impuritie in holy Matrimonie: but by this particular figuratiuely teacheth a godly abſtinence from all worldly pleaſures whatſoeuer in generall for a time; that wee may more fully attend the ſeruice of God wee goe about vpon ſpeciall occaſion. To which end the Apoſtle Paul alſo requireth the like by conſent for a time, to giue themſelues 
                        1. Cor. 7. 5. 
                        to faſting and prayer, and then to come together againe, that they be not tempted of Sathan to incontinencie. Thomas Aquinas himſelfe could ſay thus of it, Hoc ex ſepeccatum non erat, ſed multa tunc ad carnis munditias exigebantur, quae iam non ſunt neceſſaria: quia lex uostra ſpiritualem munditiam requirit, non carnis. This was not a ſinne of it ſelfe, but many things were then required to the outward clenſing of the fleſh, which are not now neceſſarie: becauſe our lawe requireth ſpirituall cleanenes, not an outward of the fleſh onely, &amp;c.
                        
                     
                     4. The markes that are ſet about the Mount to kéepe the people downe, with the puniſhment of death if they paſſed bounds, teach vs what an odious thing to GOD curioſitie is in matters forbidden: and how God would haue euery man content with that which it pleaſeth him to vouchſafe him of reuelation and knowledge. Such curioſitie is it to aſke, what God did before he made the world? and ſuch like fooliſh Queſtions. To all which it may be anſwered, as God would not haue the people to créepe vp to the mountaine, and to péepe and pry what Moſes did there with him, but ſet bounds and limits for them, beyond which they ſhould not paſſe without death:
                        
So is it ſtill. The Lord hath in his Word reuealed his Will, and beyond our limits wée muſt not goe, hauing an eare where he hath not a mouth. If wée doo, for this buſie curioſitie we ſhal dye eternally, as they for that, temporally, &amp;c.
                     
                     5 And the third day, when it was morning, there 
                        ver. 16. 
                        were thunders and lightning &amp; a thicke cloude vpon the mount: and the ſound of the trump exceeding loude, ſo that all the people that was in the campe, was afraide. This is the third branch of the particular preparation reaching vnto the 20. verſe and containing an increaſe of the Lordes manner of the communication of himſelfe, ſpecified before in the 9. verſe. By all which fearefull things the Lord declared his Maieſtie ſaith Chriſoſtome, and the people were touched with a féeling knowledge of their infirmitie. But beſides that, wée may well learne by it how profitable it is to make a good and carefull hearer of Gods voice. Firſt to ſhake him and throw him downe in himſelfe by ſome good waies and meanes: For then aſſuredly the Word entereth more powerfully, &amp; he hath a more excellent touch than without ſuch humbling he would euer haue had. Remember how the Lord called S. Paul when he was riding to Damaſcus, Firſt throwing 
                        Acts. 9. 4. 3. 
                        him downe, and by making a ſudden light ſhine about him from heauen, and then when he trembled, and was aſton
                              •
                           ed, ſpeaking to him with profitable effect. Remember alſo how there came ſuddenly from heauen a ſound as of a ruſhing &amp; a mighty winde in an other place. Surely ſuch ruſhings &amp; ſhakings &amp; ſpirituall frightings in conſcience Acts 2. 2. hath the Lord his gratious meaning in, to beate vs downe in our ſelues, that we may more carefully hearken vnto him. And becauſe the greater part of men is not acquainted with them, therefore they remaine dul hearers and dull hearted, ſo that the Preacher looſeth but his labour with them. How many haue profited in ſickneſſe by words ſpoken, who in health neuer cared what was ſpoken?

ſo in debt and pouertie, in priſon and trouble men haue other eares than they haue in proſperitie. Doth not our Chronicle mention a Gentleman who at his death vowed openlie that he had learnd more good touching his ſoule in a darke hole within the Tower of London in a few daies, than euer in all his life, when he was in light &amp; libertie abroad? Full well knoweth God the way to winne vs; and happy are we if it pleaſe him to vſe it, how ſharpe ſoeuer it be; that yet wée may liue hereafter in ioy, though preſently for a ſeaſon wée taſte of woe. I could tell you by experience (if it were néedefull) of ſome that haue ſaid to my ſelfe, they had heard many Sermons and read the Scriptures, but they neuer felt either Sermon or Scriptures as then when they ſo ſpake, béeing ſome way touched in-wardly by their louing God. But be Judge your ſelfe in your ſelfe if you know any thing.
                     Againe, theſe ſignes ſhewed the terror of the law to mens conſciences: for it thunders, it threatens, it feareth and frighteth, and it vtterly condemneth all men to Hell and damnation, were there not a CHRIST to ſaue vs from it. The law cauſeth wrath ſaith the Apoſtle, that is, it denounceth wrath againſt vs for that wee cannot Rom. 4. 15. kéepe it. When Iudas could ſée nothing but the Lawe, his agonie drane him to hang himſelfe. So was Saul, Achitophel and many others driuen to deſperate concluſions &amp; feareful ends. Wherefore the Apoſtle well addeth yt 
                        we are not come to this fearefull mount, nor vnto burning 
                        Heb. 12. 18. &amp;c. 21. 22. 
                        fire, nor to blackneſſe, &amp; darkneſſe, and tempeſt &amp;c, ſo terrible, that Moſes ſaid, I feare and quake. But we are come vnto the Mount Sion, &amp; to the Citie of the liuing God, the coeleſtiall Hieruſalem, and to the company of innumerable Angels &amp;c. AND TO IESVS THE MEDIATOR 
                        24. 
                        OF THE NEVV TESTAMENT &amp;c. Here, here is our helpe againſt the law, without whom we were caſt away euery one of vs: for curſed is he and ſhe that doth not all things written in the law.
                     
                     
                        
6 This deſcending of the Lord we muſt vnderſtand of the Signes of his pretence, and not that the Lord is here &amp; not there, or there and not here, moouing from place to place as man dooth. Neither ſpeaketh he as man dooth, but his Angell in his perſon taketh by his power the voice of man, and as God is ſaid to ſpeake by his Miniſters here, ſo by his Angels then and there as he pleaſed. Remember Steuens words in the Acts, This is he, (meaning Moſes) 
                        Acts 7. 38. 
                        that was in the cōgregatiō in the wildernes with the Angel WHICH SPAKE TO HIM IN MOVNT SINA &amp;c. The iterating of his commandement to Moſes to ſée that the people paſſe not their limits which we touched before ver. 21. &amp; 24. ſheweth the itching nature of man after hidden ſecrets, to ſee and know nouelties: And the great diſlike God hath of this curioſitie, and how profitable the preſence of the Magiſtrate is to make people kéepe order. For ſurely men are maruellous apt to tranſgreſſe, and therefore againe &amp; againe they muſt be admoniſhed by Moſes: and well if many or any admonitions will ſerue. Giue lawes neuer ſo good, and let there not bée a Gouernour to ſée to the execution of them, and wée ſée with griefe what litle good ſuch lawes doo. Well therefore and wiſelie haue they ſpoken who ſaid, Lex Magiſtratus mutus, et interdum mortuus: Magiſtratus lex loquens et viua. The Law is a dumb Magiſtrate, and ſometimes a dead: but the Magiſtrate is a ſpeaking Law and a liuing.
                     
                     7 The Prieſts alſo are mentioned aſwell as the people 
                        Ver. 24. that they likewiſe ſhould not paſſe their limits: wherby wee ſée that no dignitie authoritie or higher place may be a warrant to doo more than God permitteth. But rather ſhould theſe before others giue example of ſobriety &amp; order. What Prieſts were now, when as yet the Prieſthood was not eſtabliſhed, men differ in opinion; ſome thinking they were the firſt-borne, and others thinking otherwiſe, as Caluin for One vpen this place, to whom I refer ſuch as will, and go no further in this Chapter.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. 20.
                     1. THe Congregation béeing prepared (as you haue heard) to receaue The ſumme of this Chapter. ye 
                        Law, now in this Chap. followeth the Law it ſelfe, &amp; it is ſet down in tenne ſeuerall branches and heades, commonly called the Decalogue or Ten Commaundements. Of all which becauſe I haue made expoſition in a Booke alreadie, I will ſpare my labour here, and refer you to that Treatiſe. The other general head of this Chap. to wit, the peoples feare, beginning at the 18. verſe, I will a little touch. Firſt then it is ſaide, That all the people ſaw the thunders and 
                        Ver. 18. 
                        lightnings, and the ſound of the Trumpet, and the mountaine ſmoking: &amp; whē the people ſaw it, they fled &amp; ſtood a far of: which words yéeld vs many good things to note.
                     
                     
                        Firſt the difference of the Law and the Goſpell. The law, as hath bene ſaide, fearing and frighting, ſhaking &amp; ſhiuering the heart of Man, beateth downe his peacocks feathers and maketh him abaſhed and aſhamed in himſelfe, to crie with the prodigall Sonne, I am not worthy, I am not worthy, O Father, to be called thy ſonne. Yea it Luke. 15. 19. maketh him ſtand a far of with the poore Publican, &amp; ſmite 
                        Luke. 18. 13. 
                        his breaſt in true féeling of his ſinne: and to beſéech God for mercy to a Sinner. Whoſoeuer is not thus humbled, he neuer knew what the law ment, but like the vaine Phariſie doteth vpon himſelfe without cauſe, &amp; erreth as the Apoſtle did before the Commandement came. Contrariwiſe, Rom. 7. 9. the Goſpell chéereth and comforteth, helpeth &amp; healeth and ſwéetely allureth to come, in al ioyfull aſſurance of mercie by him who hath fulfilled the law for vs, and remooued away the curſe that would haue ſlaine vs. Read ye
                        
12. Chap. to the Hebrewes noted before, and ſée what I ſay moſt plaine, beginning at the 18. verſe.
                     
                     
                        Secondly, it may teach vs to our great good now whilſt wee haue time, that if the law were ſo terrible when it was giuen, it will be a dreadfull day when all the breaches of the ſame ſhal be iudged. And if the people fled now, ſtood a far off, and were in ſuch feare, how will the Idolater, the Blaſphemer, the Adulterer, the Drunkard, the Thiefe, the Murderer, the Rebellious and Diſobedient, the falſe witneſſe, the couetuous oppreſſour, and all ſuch iolly fellowes that now ſcorne and ſcoffe at all admonitions, I ſay, how will all theſe doo, and what will be their caſe at that day? Turne, turne we then vnto God in time, and amend your liues, that Chriſt fréeing vs from this feareful law, wée may be ſafe by his holy Goſpell.
                     
                     
                        Thirdly, this place ſheweth their ignorant folly, that ſay in their hearts, O, if I might heare God ſpeake himſelfe, I ſhould be much mooued, I ſhould belieue, and bee out of all doubt &amp;c: For were ye people here able to indure ye 
                        voice of God? Doo they not ſay to Moſes? talke thou with vs, and we will heare: but let not God talk with vs, leſt we 
                        ver. 19. 
                        dye. Little, little doo they conceiue (which thus ſay) either their own weakenes, or ye 
                        Maieſtie of God. Let them therfore learne of this people here, the bleſſing of God in giuing vs Moſes to ſpeak to vs, ye is, in raiſing vp among vs men of our own ſhape, mould &amp; matter, men that we feare not, but know &amp; loue &amp; are linked to in degrées of loue to ſpeak vnto vs in his Name, putting his holy ſpirit among them, &amp; induing them with guifts fit for ſuch a calling, in vouchſafing his Word to direct both them and vs: and ſo euery way familiarlie, and yet truly and effectually, labouring and working our ſaluation, if wee bee not obſtinate to contemne his meanes and care. This Miniſterie of Man ſo deſpiſed of Man, ſo wronged and ſo caſt downe, is an other manner of mercie than wicked worldlings conceiue or féele: but one day they ſhal

know, when it will bée too late to reforme their fault, which now they may leaue, if they haue grace. Then ſhall they ſée God, and heare God, but with greater terror than this people did héere. They ſhall alſo ſée blackneſſe and darkneſſe, they ſhall heare thundrings and lightnings, ſmokes and fires and flames with trembling perplexitie, &amp; then, if it could be had againe, Moſes voice to ſpeake vnto thē would be accepted, which now is ſo little regarded and ſet by.
                     
                        Fourthly, This darkneſſe wherein God was, noteth the Maieſtie of God to be incomprehenſible, and not to be reached ver. 21. vnto by our wits. We muſt therefore be ſober and modeſt, and humble in talking and writing of God. Simonides foūd this, when vndertaking to ſhew what God was, the more he ſtudied to doo it, the more time ſtill he craued, and was further and further off. Firſt he aſked three daies, &amp; then ſix, and then double againe, and in the end gaue ouer and could not doo it. To vs this place may be in ſtead of a thouſand. But Moſes drew neere vnto the darkneſſe where God was. GOD dwelleth in light, but in regard of our weakneſſe it is darkneſſe: and happie wée, if wée acknowledge our weakeneſſe and craue helpe where it is to be had. Other things your ſelfe may note which I paſſe ouer. The great charge that God giueth to beware any Images of ver. 23. 
                        him, either of Gold or Siluer you may conferre with the 4. Chap. of Deut. with ye 
                        ſecond Cōmandement, whereof I haue ſpoken, and ſettle in your heart how odious to God that courſe is frō which yet no perſwaſion will draw ſome. If God would be remembred by an Image, he would haue ſuffered it, if he would be worſhipped in an Image, hee would haue ſuffered it, and he would haue letten them ſée ſome forme which they might haue followed, &amp; if he could like of an Image of wood, or ſtone, more fit for his Maieſtie were gold &amp; ſiluer. But you ſée al is for bidden, &amp; curſed with them are the makers of them, which is a fearefull thing if it were thought of. Reade Eſay 45. ver. 16.
                     2 An Altar of earth ſhalt thou make &amp;c. God would ver. 24.
                        
haue but one Altar, to note one truth, and one Religion. He would haue it of earth, or rude &amp; without labour, that vhen they remooued they might throw it downe, or it fall of it ſelfe, ſo that poſterity might take no cauſe of Idolatry thereby. Steppes to the ſame Altar he forbiddeth likewiſe, Ver. 26. for the cauſe ſpecificd in the margin of your Bible, and it well teacheth that in Gods Worſhip all things ſhould be done deuoutly and comely, euen as the Apoſtle himſelfe teacheth and requireth. Ignorant and prophane men delight in pompe and earthly ſhew, but Chriſtians muſt indeauour to haue all thiugs done ſo modeſtly, and ſoberly, as to euery man it may appeare what ſpirit they are guided and gouerned by. The multitude of Popiſh Altars might here be remembred if it were néedefull, and that good decree of the ſecond Councill of Africa Chap. 50. and the fift of Carthage Chap. 14. That ſuch ſuſpitious Altars as were in thoſe daies ſet-up in euery corner▪ ſhould be plucked downe, beeing built vppon dreames and ſuperſtitious conceipts. And if without tumult they could not bee pulled downe, then the people to be admoniſhed not to frequent thoſe places, leſt they ſhould be abuſed by ſuperſtition, &amp;c. Alſo it might be ſhewed how the communion tables be called of the old Fathers both tables and Altars indifferently. Tables as they are indéed, and Altares as they are improperly. How they were made ofboords, and remooueable, ſet in the midſt of the people, and not placed againſt a wall, with diuers other things: but hereafter will be a fitter place.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. 21.
                     1. THe Lawes of God are vſually deuided into moral, Ceremoniall, and Iudiciall Lawes. In the Chapter before we haue had the Morall Lawes, to wit, the Tenne commandements; herafter we ſhall haue ye 
                        Ceremonial. And now in theſe thrée Chapters following God layeth downe certaine Iudiciall Laws. The Morall Law of God is the law of Nature, ſhewing what ought to bee the manners and natures of all men, and it is the ground of all Lawes whatſoeuer, either Diuine, or Humane. The Ceremoniall being in this reſpect Natural, becauſe among men Nature requires order and decencie: And the Iudiciall being the execution of the Morall which is Naturall. For humane Lawes they are made by probable reaſon of Gouernours and tend either to directions to kéepe the Moral, or to circumſtances of execution in puniſhing offendors. As for example, Gods law ſaith, Thou ſhalt not kill, Mans Law forbiddeth the carrying Chap. 20. 13. of theſe and theſe weapons, ſo to take away occaſion and meanes of breaking the law of God. Gods law commaundeth there ſhalbe Magiſtrates, Mans law appointeth theſe are thoſe. At Rome two Conſuls,
                         in other Cities foure. At Rome annuall,
                         in other places perpetuall &amp;c. Gods law appointeth that a Debtor not able to pay ſhalbe puniſhed. Mans law appointeth differing waies, according to circumſtances of places: as in ſome countries by perpetuall impriſonment, in other places otherwiſe. Draco his law was, That he ſhould be plucked in peeces, and euery Creditor haue a part: The Law of GOD
                        
requireth theft to be puniſhed by reſtitution of double

                            ſumenda eſt. Valent enim leges poſitiuae propter duas cauſas, ſcilicet propter probabilem rationē ex iure Naturae er circumſtantijs petitā, et propter authoritatē Magiſtratus a quo prolatae ſunt. Chap. 20. 12. Ver. 2. or foure folde. Mans lawe by reſtitution, and ſomewhere by death. By all which examples you ſée how GODS lawe is ſtill the ground of mans lawe and the end of mans law (if a good lawe) is euer the kéeping of GODS law. Now to come to the Text of this Chapter. The firſt law laide downe is touching ſeruants and ſeruitude, which you may referre to the Moral law, Honour thy Father and Mother. Degrées of men concerning ruling and obeying being contained in the law.
                     
                     The words of the Text are theſe, If thou buy an Hebrew ſeruant, he ſhal ſerue ſixe yeares, and in the ſeuenth, he ſhall goe free, for nothing, &amp;c. From which verſe to the twelfth verſe you haue the matter of ſeruitude and freedome laide downe: and it ſhall be good to obſerue the Will of God in it. He would not haue them euer bond, as amongſt the Nations elſwhere it was; becauſe they were deliuered out of Egypt by his mercie, aſ
                           •
                        el as their Maſters were: whereupon in Leuiticus he challengeth them for his, &amp; ſaith, For they are my ſeruants, whom I brought 
                        Leuit. 25. 42. 
                        out of the land of Egypt: they ſhall not be ſold as bond-men are ſold. Thou ſhalt not rule ouer them cruelly, but 
                        43. 
                        ſhalt feare thy God. Yet would hée not haue the Maiſter damnified, and therefore he alloweth of 7. yeares, commanding their libertie, and recompence ſaying, whē thou ſendeſt him out free from thee, thou ſhalt not let him go away 
                        Deutro. 15. 13 
                        emptie. The vſe whereof is comfortable to ſeruants, and profitable to Maſters. To ſeruants it ſheweth the louing care the Lord hath ouer them, which may cheere them in al their doings, being well aſſured, that what they doo well this God will euer reward, though man doo not. Whereunto ſerueth the exhortation of the Apoſtle and promiſe annexed. Seruants, be obedient vnto them that are
                         
                        Colloſſ. 3. 22. 
                        your maſters according to the fleſh, in all things, not with eye ſeruice as men pleaſers, but in ſingleneſſe of heart, fearing God. And whatſoeuer you do, do, it heartely as to the

Lord and not to men, knowing that of the Lord ye ſhall 
                        23. 24. 
                        receiue the rewarde of the inheritance: for ye ſerue the Lord Chriſt. And y• very like Saying againe he hath to the Epheſians. So rewarded he the faithfull ſeruice of Iacob 
                        Eph. 6. 5. though his maiſter were hard; ſo Ioſeph, ſo many mo. To Maſters it teacheth moderation and mercie: for how dare they wrong thoſe whom God calleth his, &amp; hath ſuch a tender care of? The Apoſtle in the places named, ſo ſaith alſo. Yee Maſters do vnto your ſeruants, that which is iuſt and equall, knowing that ye alſo haue a Maiſter in Heauē. 
                        Colloſſ. 4. 1. Where this is not done, God is angrie; as you may ſée by that feareful ſpéech in Ieremie. Becauſe ye haue not obeied 
                        Ier. 34. 17. 
                        me in proclaiming a libertie to your ſeruāts &amp;c, therfore behold I proclaime a libertie to you ſaith the Lord, to the ſword, to the Peſtilence, and to the famine, and I will make a terror to all the Kingdomes of the earth. Reade the place from the 9. Verſe to the end of the Chapter. Iob therefore a good and iuſt man, had a great care of this, and proteſteth he did not contemne the iudgement of 
                        Iob. 31. 13. 
                        his ſeruant, and of his maide, when they did contende with him, becauſe he that made him in the Wombe, he alſo made them, &amp; if he ſhould wrong them, what could hee anſwere to God for it? A moſt worthy example for all Maſters. Thus may all other gouernours and Superiours make vſe of this law, and learne to take no pride in their authoritie, not to affect greatneſſe, &amp; not to ſwell and looke bigge ouer their inferiours. For certainly the Lord will puniſh it, &amp; al wiſe men will laugh at it. Rule and gouernment is of God, but pride and vanitie is of the Deuil. Titles to men God will haue giuen, but to deſire Titles he neuer liked, much leſſe Titles vpon Titles and neuer inough. It 
                           Ambroſe. lib, 5 exam. cap. 21. ſoundeth in Bookes to the Perſians ſhame, that the gouernours there, will be free from all lawes, and what they liſt, that they may: But theirinferiours muſt be bound with Strabo. lib. 5. all cruel bonds, euen to kil themſelues if they command, &amp; to indure al burdens impoſed vpō them: If they be cruelly

beaten, to giue thanks that the Gouernours haue them in remembrance. The Phariſies were vaine men to affect the vppermoſt places, and to be called Rabbi. But this proude minde is like the water to the Dropſie-man that maketh more thirſtie the more it is drunke. No end of ſuperioritie 
                        Quo plus ſunt potae plus ſituntur aquae. with ſome men. They that are noble will be Princes; Princes will be Kings; Kings will be Emperours; and Emperours muſt be Gods. That vaine woman Cleopatra, ſhee muſt be called Queene of Queenes. Sapor the Regina Reginarum. 
                        Perſian wrote to Conſtantius, and called himſelfe King of Kings, &amp; brother to the ſtarres, the Sunne and the Moone, &amp;c. Theſe that thus hunger after glory and Maieſtie, how can they vſe authoritie moderately and humbly? Such pride commeth out of the roote of folly, and begetteth contempt of all inferiours, contempt bréedes ſedition and rebellion, they warres, and warre deſtruction at laſt of all, both men and titles. It is written of Traian that hee was much caried away with vaine-glorie in titles: and therefore painted in his houſe many inſcriptions, which Conſtantinus wiſely ieſting at, called Herbam parietariam, wall flowers.
                         Such a vaine fellow was Herod in the Acts, and what a ſhamefull downfall had hee? Let then this law of Acts. 12. 22. &amp; 23. God for ſeruants freedome, together with all other Scriptures, ſhewing his care of them, and their good vſage, ſettle in our hearts the right vſe of anthoritie, and make vs neither vaine in coueting nor cruell in vſing. The boring of his eare, was a ſigne of obedience, and figuratiuelie ver. 6. admoniſhed, that ſeruants muſt not be deafe, but quick and readie, and willing to heare what is commaunded to them. And ſpiritually, that if wee be the Lords ſeruants, he boreth by his holy grace our eare, that is, he maketh vs haue eares to heare his holy word, and wee are not deaſe, we flie not from it, we caſt it not away, wee ſtop not our eares: but with care and zeale, and loue, we hearken to it, as men and women whoſe eares he hath opened or bored. This one thing well marked may ſhake the hearts and

conſciences of Popiſh Recuſants, ſo preſumptuouſlie deſpiſing the Lords voice: But followe it your ſelfe, I paſſe away.
                     2. After theſe lawes concerning ſeruants, follow other lawes concerning Murder and killing, which you may referre to the expoſition of that commaundement. Puniſhment God ſtill layeth vpon ſinne, but not euer after one manner. Sometimes hee ſtriketh the bodie, ſometimes the ſoule, and ſometimes both. Sometimes he toucheth our goods, ſometime our name, and ſomtimes our friends and deare ones. Who can reckon vp his wayes to puniſh the rebelling man or woman againſt him? His ends alſo for which he doth thus are ſundrie and diuers, but all and euer moſt iuſt. Firſt, for his owne iuſtice who is a conſuming 
                        1. 
                        fire, and muſt néedes binde either to obey or to be puniſhed. Secondly, that there may be ſéene a difference 
                        2. Oderunt peccare boni &amp;c. 3. betwixt the good and the bad, which could not be, if there were not puniſhment and reward. Thirdly, for example, that others ſéeing, may feare and flie from euill, either for loue of vertue, or feare of paine. Fourthly, for the good 
                        4. euen of ſuch as are puniſhed. For as Plato could ſay, Paenae, &amp; ipſis qui perferunt, et ſpectatoribus, vtiles ſunt. Vtri
                                 
                                    
                                 
                                 que
                              
                           
                         
                        Omnes poenaemū

                        enim redduntur meliores, illi dolore, hi exemple. Puniſhment is good for both ſeer and ſufferer, amending the one by example, and the other by ſmart. Fiftly,
                         that theſe ſhort puniſhments temporall, might put them in minde of the long paines eternall. Laſtly, for the preſeruation of the ſocietie and peace of mankinde, which by ſlaughters and bloodſhed Eſt immedi

                     3. We ſée héere degrees of faults taken from the cauſes. For all actions procéeding from the minde or iudgement and the will commaunding the outward members, when the minde knoweth what ought to be done, and erreth not in the obiect, and yet the will goeth contrarie to

iudgment &amp; the law of God not forced nor compelled, but willingly &amp; freely, ſuch actions are called voluntarie. So ſlewe Caine his brother Abell, &amp; ſo tooke Dauid Vrias his wife. But when things are done not of election, either for probable ignorance (as whē the minde erreth, or taketh no counſaile) or when the wil by violence is hindered, or the Dolus. Culpa lata. Culpa leuis et leniſs. Caſus fortuitus vt ille canem lapide petēs nouercā
                            ferit. Has patitur poenas peccandi ſola voluntas. Nā ſcelus intra ſe tacitū qui cogitat vllum, Facti crimen habet. Ver. 13. 
                        outward mēbers by a violence forced, then are thoſe faults ſaide to be voluntarie. The Lawyers diſtinguiſh faults by diuers names, which I ſtand not vpon here, remembring for whoſe vſe, I draw theſe notes: But in ſhort, thus much we learne here, that God meaſureth faults by wil, &amp; not by Act. Wherevppon it is here ſaide, that willfull murther ſhalbe death, and killing without purpoſe &amp; will ſhall not, but an other courſe is taken. For if a man hath not laide waite (ſaith the Text) but God hath offered him into thy hand (meaning when by chaunce he is killed without any minde ſo to do, which chaunce yet God by his hidden prouidence guideth) in ſuch a caſe I will appoint thee a place whither he ſhall fly; meaning certaine Cities of refuge or Sanctuaries vſed thē in theſe caſes, as you may ſée in Deut. at large. Of which Sanctuaries thus ordained of God for Chap. 19. 11. ye people and thoſe times, ſprang our ſanctuaries vſed within this Realme and others, but nowe in moſt places put down and forbidden. The queſtion of them is diſputed to and fro by mens wits, &amp; the likers of them to continue, vſe theſe and ſuch other reaſons. The Anger &amp; conceiued diſpleaſure in the Iudge againſt a man; The power of his aduerſarie that perſecuteth before that iudge; The Difficultie and obſcuritie of the cauſe not quickely to be determined. In al which caſes they think a Sanctuarie would be fit in a common wealth. Secondly, againſt crueltie of Maiſters that either ſhould threaten danger to a ſeruant, or by violence ſeeke to force him to ſoule matters, ſuch a refuge would yeeld cōfort till his cauſe were known &amp; he preuided for. Thirdly, in the time of warre &amp; diſtres, theſe places gaue ſafety to many from the bloodie ſword &amp; murdering

hand of inraged enemies, for furie a while not weighing right. Fourthly, in caſuall killings without pretended malice, great was the vſe &amp; equity (ſay they) of theſe Sanctuaries. Contrariwiſe they that ſtand for the taking of them away, alleadge many euils and diſcommodities that grew from them in ſucceſſe of time, through mans corruption, albeit at the beginning there was a goodend: As incouragement of ſeruaunts to bee diſobedient, and very vndutifull. Great defrauding of Creditors by vngodly and unconſcionable debtors. Increaſing of thieues and ſuch like euilles many and many. Whereupon grew that good Saying of Saint Chryſoſtome. Nullos tam ſaepe ad eccleſiae aſylum fugere, quam qui nec Deum nec eccleſiam curabant. None more vſually &amp; often fled to the Sanctuarie of the Church, than they that cared neither for God nor the Church. If a man come preſumptuouſly vpon his 
                        Ver. 14. 
                        neighbour to ſlay him with guile, you ſée God cōmanded no Sanctuary ſhould ſaue him, but he ſhould be takē from the Altar, and dye.
                     
                     4 He that ſmiteth his Father or Mother, ſhall dye the death. This is an other law in this Chap. which maketh for ye 
                        expoſitiō
                         of that Cōmandement of honouring them, &amp; is to be referred to it. We may note in it, how God dooth not ſay, he that killeth Father or Mother ſhalbe killed for it; but he that ſmiteth, ſo that not ſo much as a tip is to be giuen to parents vpon paine of death, no not wich the tong may wée ſmite them, that is, by any euill and vnfit words abuſe them, as you may at large reade in the expoſition of that Commandement. So great is the honour of Parents before God, and ſo ſharpe a Iudge is God againſt all abuſers of them: Little thought of by too many in our daies, &amp; the rather becauſe continually in the Church there is not a beating of theſe points of Catechiſme into Childrens heades, and hearts, by carefull Miniſters. O, that they woulde bée once drawen to doo this dutie in their ſeuerall Churches: Soone, ſoone ſhoulde they finde the Fruite of it, and the greatneſſe of their Sinne

in ſo long neglecting it. In Plato an heathen we reade the like law, wherein is decréed that all beating and contumelies of Parents ſhould bée puniſhed with perpetuall baniſhment and death. By the Romane lawes the ſlaier of his parents was not to be ſlaine either with ſword or fire, or other ordinary puniſhment, ſed in ſutus culeo, &amp;c. ſowed in a ſacke with a Dogge, a Cocke, a Viper, and an Ape, he ſhould be throwne into the Sea or Riuer, that the ayre whileſt he liued, and the earth when he was dead might be denied him, who ſo had wronged them that gaue him a life and beeing in the ayre and vpon the earth.
                         A good Writer teſtifieth hee ſaw one put to death at Tigurine who had curſed and reuiled his Mother.
                     
                     5 He that ſtealeth a Man and ſelleth him, if hee be 
                        ver. 16. 
                        found with him, ſhall dye the death. To flocke away (as wee ſpeake) a mans ſeruant, Man or Maide, or to buy Plagium. or ſell a freeman, and ſo to bring him into bondage, was a grieuous ſinne with God, and therefore thus ſeuerely puniſhed. Thus ſinned the brethren of Ioſeph againſt him, when they ſold him to bee a bondman, and to be vſed as pleaſed the buyers, which might haue béene ſo as twentie deathes had béene better. Great therefore was their ſinne in that action. This law is to be referred to the 7. Commandement and to the 5. alſo.
                     6. When men ſtriue together, and one ſmite an other with the ſtone, or with the fiſt, and he dye not, but lyeth in

                        bed, If he riſe againe and walke without vpon his ſtaffe, then ſhall he that ſmote him go quite (meaning for mans ver. 19.

By the ſtone or fiſt are meant all other things whereby any wound is giuen, although theſe onely bée named for example. For with ſword or dagger or any weapon all was one, if hée were wounded and recouered ſo, that hée was as fit for his vocation as before, then this was the law; but if he were maimed, then otherwiſe. If a man ſmite his ſeruant or his

                        ver. 21. 
                        not be puniſhed; for hee is his money. Theſe lawes of God were fitted for the ſtate of that people, when many things were indured which were not allowed. If the ſeruant dyed preſentlie, it was more grieuous, and therefore puniſhed, but if hee liued a time after, not ſo; yet before God it was murder alſo, though by Mans law he eſcaped both in regard he was his money in his maſters power, and alſo becauſe there might in that daye or two happen ſome other cauſe of death than that beating. Perfection in theſe lawes wée muſt not looke for, becauſe God was pleaſed to beare with much weakeneſſe; But yet know wée euer what his Morall law requireth, and follow that which forbiddeth the abuſing of ſeruants aſwell as of others, becauſe they alſo beare the Image of God, and God careth for them, as hath béene ſhewed.

                        that her childe depart from her, and ſhe yet dye not, hee ſhalbe ſurely puniſhed as the womans husband ſhall appoint him, or he ſhall pay as the Arbiters determine. But if

Still obſerue how theſe lawes tend to the explanation of ſome of the Ten Commandements, and referre this to the fift.

This law of equalitie was in effect thus alſo in the 12. Tables at Rome, the equitie thereof béeing deriued to them either

from other Nations or by the light of Nature. The verſe ſaith

                     It is verie iuſt if men ſuffer the ſame things of others which they haue done to others. If any man obiect, that by Lex Talionis. 
                        Chriſt in the fifth of Matthew this law is repealed, or was diſliked: we anſwere, neither; but there our Sauiour condemneth the abuſe of this law according to priuate affections, and for the nouriſhing of a luſt to reuenge by priuate perſons that are not Magiſtrates, and neuer would be intreated to forgiue any. Whereas he liketh euer in his children mercy, and kindneſſe, and patience, and ſo to ouercome our enemies as his words ſhew, Recompence not euill for euill, but ouercome euill with goodneſſe.

All of them teach vs, wt that care we ſhould liue of our Neighbours goods as well as of our owne, no way hurting either the one or the other, ſmall or great, frée or bond, but peaceably ſpending our daies with all men, and doing what good wée can any way. God wée ſée is iuſt, and we ſhould be iuſt. God careth for the ſafetie and well béeing not onely of all ſorts of Men, but euen of the very brute beaſts; and we muſt learn to doo the like, that by our reſembling of him, we may be knowne to be his Children, one day to inherite with his deare Sonne in his eternall kingdome. This will not ſuch curſed courſes, as many men delight in, bring them to, who in oppreſſing their neighbours, in hurting their

                        ſeruants, in ſpoyling mens goods, and killing their Cattle, in fightings, and ſtriuings, and all euill, take their great and dayly pleaſure. Who hath eares to heare

                        THe Lorde goeth-on with more lawes, all tending to the explanation of the ten commaundements: and in this Chapter verie excellēt lawes, are laid downe: which how ſoeuer they are not in vſe among vs, yet yeeld this good by the reading and marking of them. To teach vs priuatelie in our ſelues an honeſt, good, and holy carriage of our ſelues. Princes may alter laws, as circumſtances of times and place ſhall require; but the equitie that God had in theſe laws euer remaineth. And therfore what he puniſhed we muſt auoide, if we doo well.
                     
                        Firſt, hee beginneth with lawes againſt theft, which Ver. 1. muſt bée referred to that Commandement: and according to ſeuerall degrees and differences of theft, he maketh ſeuerall and differing paines. If a man ſteale an 
                        Quin

                        Sheepe, and kill it or ſell it, he ſhall reſtore fiue Oxen for the Oxe, and foure Sheepe for the ſheepe. The greater theft hath the greater puniſhment. Other Nations, by the light of God ſet in them, followed much this courſe and puniſhed theft diuerſly. Draco puniſhed it with death. Solon (if it were manifeſt) with foure folde; if not ſo manifeſt, with double 
                        Romani furtum manifeſtū 
                           quadruplo, non manifeſtum duplo puniebant. The Rom. 12. Tables did the like. Latter lawes with vs, make theft death, if aboue ſuch a value: following therein a conſtitutiō of Lotha

the Emperour, whoſe ſumme was aboue fiue ſhillings.
                     An other caſe concerning theft, followeth in the ſecond and third verſes. If a Thiefe be found breaking vp a houſe, 
                        Ver. 2. 
                        and bee ſmitten that hee dye, no bloud ſhall bee ſhed for him (his meaning is, if this bée in the night:) But if it bee in the day light, blood ſhall bee ſhed for him: 
                        Ver. 3. 
                        for hee ſhoulde make full reſtitution: if hee had not wherewith, then ſhould he be ſolde for his theſt. The lawe therefore appointing that puniſhment, hée ſhould not bée killed that brake a houſe in the day. The Romans twelue Tables followed this equitie, and in the night theſe breakers might bee killed anie waie: But in the day not, except he defended himſelfe by a weapon. Our owne lawes haue made a difference betwixt day-thieues, and night-thieues, as indéede there is much cauſe to diſtinguiſhe them; the feare in the night beeing farre greater, and the helpe to be had farre leſſe, with many other circumſtances. But here may bée a Queſtion aſked, what is lawfull before God, theſe béeing but ciuill conſtitutions? And anſwere may be made, what God permitteth ſurely is lawfull before him, and hurteth not the cenſcience, if it be done as he permitteth. But if our owne affection, cruelty, and rage ſtep in, béeing méere priuate men, take héede, for wée may doo a thing lawfull not lawfully. The Law biddeth kill not, but if a man ſmite to driue a thiefe away, and death follow without a killing minde, the caſe is altered: for there is inculpatatutela, as Lawyers tell vs, within the compaſſe whereof I take this caſe to bée:
                     An other law followeth in the 4. verſe, That if the theft were found with him, aliue, he reſtored double: if killed 
                        Ver. 4. or ſolde, you ſaw in the firſt verſe an other puniſhment more heauy. So muſt circumſtances direct Iudges to ſeuerall puniſhments: and the wiſdome of God make man wiſe in all his proceedings. They that thinke death too much, muſt remember yt euen Gods law made the ſtealth
                        
of man death, And Dauid ſaid, he that had takē the poore 
                        2. Sam. 12. 5. 
                        mans one ſheepe ſhould ſurely dye. Draco made it death, as you heard before: and the Romans decreed, that ſtealing 
                        
                           Cato: Fures priuatos in nexu &amp; compedibus viuere, publicos in auro et purpura. 
                        ſeruants, ſhould firſt be beaten, and then throwen down from a Rock, &amp; ſlaine. But I pray you, would theſe men that thus pleade for the continuance of this law of Moſes, That Thieues ſhould reſtore &amp; not dye, be aſwell content that other lawes ſhould ſtand in force alſo, as namely, That adultery ſhould be puniſhed with death? gathering but ſtickes on the Sabbath day, with death, &amp;c? No I warrant you. And therefore what they thinke, is not a Rule, but what God alloweth, whoſe will is euer iuſtice it ſelfe, and who by his Apoſtle hath taught, That ſo long as lawes haue this end to be a terror to the euill, &amp; a defēce to the good, ye forme of them may be diuers: Neither now a daies is all theft death, but the Iudge weigheth circumſtances of neede for ſuſtinance only, of the firſt offence, of repētance, of youth, of towardlineſſe, and ſuch like.
                     2. After theft, follow lawes for damages or treſpaſſes done to our Neighbours: &amp; the Text ſaith, If a man hurt a 
                        Ver. 5. 
                        field or a Vineyard, &amp; put in his beaſts to feed in an other mans field, he ſhall recompence of the beſt of his owne field, &amp; of the beſt of his own Vineyard. And if fire breake 
                        Ver. 6. 
                        out, and catch in the thornes, and ſtackes of corne, or the ſtanding corne, or the field be conſumed, he that kindled the fire, ſhall make full reſtitution. Who knoweth not, that the ſocietie of man cannot continue without recompence of loſſes and harmes? Therefore mercifully dooth God regard it &amp; make lawes for it. Euripides maketh Iocaſta ſpeake of this equitie, when he giueth her theſe words, Melius eſt equalitatem colere, quae amicos amicis, vrbes vrbibus, ſocios ſocijs deuincit &amp;c. Better it is to regard equality, which bindeth friends to friends, Cities to Cities &amp; fellowes to fellowes, &amp;c.
                         Now equalitie is, if I haue hurt any man, to make amends that no man be pulled in his eſtate.
                     
                        
3. Concerning pledges, borrowing, lending, &amp;c. If 
                        Ver. 7. 
                        a man deliuer his neighbour money or ſtuffe to keepe, and it be ſtollen out or his houſe, if the thiefe be found, 
                        See the 8 Commandement of theſe matters more. Ver. 8. 
                        hee ſhall paye the double, If the Thiefe bee not found, then the maiſter of the houſe ſhal be brought to the Iudges to ſweare, whether he hath put his hand to his neighbours goods or no? That is, whether himſelfe hath ſtollen it or no &amp;c? vnto the 16. verſe. In all Nations, faithfulneſſe and truth in matters committed to truſt hath béene highly regarded, and the contrary puniſhed. Therefore euen with Heathens, beſide recompence impoſed, hée was infamous that offended this way, which how great a puniſhment it was, they ſée that rightly conſider it. The Lawyers called it a ciuile death, becauſe it leaueth to a man no Ciuiliter mortuis. 
                        honeſt place among men in the commō-wealth, he being diſabled to ſue for any thing, to giue any voice, to be any witneſſe, or to be of any credit any way. There is too much iniquitie amongſt men in theſe matters, &amp; therefore to be wiſhed greatly, that theſe lawes of God were often read and marked. Truth in truſt is a iewell of price pleaſing to God and man, and meſt honorable euer to the partie aliue &amp; dead. Let Chriſtians of all other men ſo thinke, that the waies of God be not ill ſpoken of for their faults, ſuch men had better neuer haue béene borne, than without care ſo to ſinne. Now go we a little farther than this law expreſly goeth, and iudge in our owne heart, if falſhood in pledges committed to me by man be thus odious, is not vnfaithfulneſſe in Gods pledge much more odieus? Remember ye 
                        place to Timothie, Cuſtodi depoſitum: That worthy 
                        2. Tim. 1. 14. 
                        thing which was cōmitted to thee, keep through the holy-ghoſt which dwelleth in vs. What worthy pledge is this but the pure and holy doctrine of ye 
                        word, which I muſt neuer mingle with mans traditions? The manner of teaching it, if I be a Teacher, muſt be plaine, profitable, and to the moſt edification, not to the greateſt oſtentation. Be faithfull in theſe things therefore, for they are pledges lest with vs by God, which he wil aſke for againe, and require an accompt what we haue done with them &amp;c.

                        her, he ſhall endow her and take her to wife. But if her father refuſe to giue her to him, he ſhall pay money, according 
                        Verſ. 17. 
                        to the dowry of virgins. Where you may obſerue the ſeuerity of God &amp; the remiſnes of man in puniſhing matters of this kinde. For man made his law diſiunctiue, he ſhall marry her, or giue her dowry: But God maketh a copulatiue, 
                        Aut. Et. he ſhall marrie her and giue her dowrie, yet leauing frée ye 
                        fathers authoritie, whether he would ſo beſtow her or no. If the father would beſtow her, then both muſt he marrie her and endowe her, becauſe he had thus offended with her. So God euer regarded parents conſents in the placing of their children. Yea Nature it ſelfe ſaw this equitie in Hermione ye 
                        maid in Euripides, who anſwered Oreſtes ye ſought her to wife; that the mariage of her belonged to her father.

                           . He that will, may read S. Ambroſe vpon the ſtorie of Rebecca, and ſée his iudgement of this thing. But why was not the maid puniſhed alſo, aſwel as ye 
                        man? partly becauſe yeares and ſex &amp; weaknes of iudgement might be occaſion of fall in her, but chiefly becauſe ſuch money impoſed vpon her, muſt haue come from the parents, who were innocent, and had griefe inough by the fall of their child. Furthermore, this is to be remembred here, that if ye parents would beſtow her, neuer might he that had abuſed her, put her away by bill of diuorce as other might. The Romans did not inforce marriage, becauſe the man might be noble &amp; the woman meane; or contrariwiſe, the woman noble &amp; the man mean. Wheras the Iſraelites were all alike noble deſcended from one &amp; the ſame houſe, &amp; the pedegree knowne, but i

In this place, ſaith One, God ioyneth this law next after that of inticing young women, becauſe many times theſe witches are iuſtruments to work them to mens ſinful deſires.

If there bee found amongſt you in any of thy Cities which the Lord thy God giueth, the man or woman that hath wrought wickedneſſe in the ſight of the Lord thy God in tranſgreſsing his couenants, and hath gone and ſerued other Gods and worſhiped them, as the Sun or the Moone, or any of the hoſt of heauen which I haue not commanded, and if it be told thee, and ſo forth, then ſtone that perſon to death, &amp;c. In the 13. Chapter the like death is Deut. 13. 6. 9. 10. impoſed vpon thoſe that ſhall perſwade &amp; draw to this ſin. So both worker and willer ſuffered death. And indéede ſhoulde théeues dye for robbing man, and not man dye for robbing God? Can mans goods be compared wt 
                        Gods honour? No, no. Againe if we ſmeare fealtie to the Prince his enemie, Dye wée not worthely? To ſweare fealtie to the Diuell by Idolatrie is worſe to God than that to man. Happy were deceaued creatures, if any thing would make them wiſe, &amp; bring them backe againe to God only, only, and marke the word.

Our ſtate in this world is not tyed to any place, but God at his pleaſure may remooue vs euen when we thinke leaſt, therefore the Lord would haue them then, and all men ſtill favourable to ſtrangers. Experiences of euill paſt and expectances of future, if God ſo pleaſe to haue it, muſt make men forbeare Non ignara mali miſeris ſuccurrere diſco. thoſe diſcourteſies to ſtrangers, yt otherwiſe mans corruption will offer.

The next Chapter verſe 9. teacheth this matter againe, and often is it beaten vpon by God, that they may remember it. Hippias in Plato ſaith By Nature euery like

                        is cozen to his like, and ſurely it is a great knot among men, likeneſſe either of wit, manners, iudgment, or fortune, &amp;c. Which Plutarch alſo witneſſeth when he ſaith, 
                           Plut. lib. de diſcrimine amici 
                              •
                           t adulatoris. 
                        Senis lingua ſuaniſſima eſt ſeni, puer puero, mulier mulieri iucunda eſt. Et aegrotus afficitur calamitate aegrotantis, &amp; arū
                           noſus ſocio calamitatum ſuam ſententiam a ſcribit. The ſpeech of an old man pleaſeth an other old man, a childe contē
                              teth a childe, and a woman a woman. One ſicke body feeleth the paine of an other, and pittieth it. So do fellowes in affliction talke together and expreſſe each to other their mindes.
                         Wherefore God vſeth for his reaſon here, that they alſo haue bene Strangers in Egypt.
                         It pleaſeth the good Spirit of God to vſe this comfort to his Church, touching Chriſt, if you remember: That we 
                        Heb. 4. 15. 
                        haue not a high Prieſt, which cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities, but was in all things tempted in like ſort, yet without ſin. And thereupon concludeth, Let vs therefore goe boldly vnto the throne of grace, 
                        16.
                        
                        that we may receaue mercie, and finde grace to helpe in time of neede. If wée be not in abilitie to doo Strangers any good, yet comfortable words ſhal pleaſe both them, and God that made this law for them.
                     The other law concerning Widowes, &amp; fatherleſſe Orphanes, 
                        
                           Ver. 22. Mortuis et iacē
                           tibus omnia inſul tāt. Sophocles.
                         as the Lord made it in great mercie, ſo will he euer puniſh ye breaches with ſharpe iuſtice. Affliction, ſaith Salomon, is not to be added to the afflicted. Widowes &amp; fatherleſſe children therfore muſt be pittied, &amp; comforted, &amp; helped if neede require, ſéeing they haue loſt their head; &amp; not oppreſſed and wronged, vexed &amp; grieued, as often they are. Now, that ye Lord wil puniſh, you ſée the Text plaine, and how? (O reade it againe, for it is fearefull) with the 
                        Ver. 24. 
                        ſword will he deſtroy thoſe wringers and cruſhers, that their wiues alſo may become widowes, and their children fatherleſſe. So verifying ye wiſe Saying. By what a man 
                        Chriſt had a care of his mother at his death. Iob. 31. 16. 
                        ſinneth, by that ſhal he be puniſhed. Careful therfore was Iob to auoide this danger, and voweth vehemently that he neuer reſtrained the poore of their deſire, nor cauſed the eyes of the widow to faile, by long waiting for her requeſt. Let this, mooue vs, and ſtrike vs, and euer profit vs.
                     
                        If thou lend money to my people, that is, to the poore 
                        
                           Ver. 25. Vſuraius ſuper omnes mercatores maledictus. Chryſoſt. hom. 38. ſuper Mat. Amb. li. de Dauid. Et eſca Vſura eſt, et veſtis Vſura est, et quodcunque ſorti accedit, quod velis ei nomen imponas, Vſura eſt. 
                        with thee, thou ſhalt not be as an Vſurer vnto him, ye ſhall not oppreſſe him with vſury. This matter of vſury is ſo largely handled by many, and ſo little regarded by moe, that I ſpare my labour in it. To allow all that ſome allow, or to condemne as much as * ſome condemne, as yet I ſée no reaſon. Many are the caſes, and intricate are the queſtions mooued &amp; mentioned in this matter. Orphanes are left with nothing to bring them vp, but a portion of money, ſome in the Vniuerſities, ſome in the Country. Spend the ſtocke and it will ſoone be gone; vſe it, &amp; occupy it themſelues they cannot. So they haue money and want a trade, others haue trades, and want money. Bucer in Cambridge was aſked this queſtion, and did not diſlike In King Edward the 6. dayes. of ſome interchange profitable to the Orphane; and yet not opening the way to flat vſury. Stran gers likewiſe and

                        exiles out of their countrey for religion and good cauſes, bring a little money with them for eaſines of carriage, and nothing elſe, themſelues happily may not trade in a forraigne land; how then ſhall they, their wiues, and children liue? workmen peraduenture alſo they are not, but of an higher degrée. In ſhort therefore, we know the end of the cōmandement is loue: ſo far thē, as borrowing 
                        1. Tim. 1. 5. &amp; lending breaketh not that, but agréeth with it, moderate men may do what is fit for them, &amp; no ſcope giuen to ye condemned vſurer. To méete with one inconuenience, &amp; to bring many others into the common-wealth, was neuer wiſedome. Wherefore let euerie man ſearch his own heart, and well obſerue his owne dealings, in lending to his neighbour that liueth with him, as knowing that nothing is hid frō 
                        God, but muſt be accoūted for one day. If cōtracts &amp; charitie agrée not together, but what profiteth you, hurteth your neighbour, ye caſe is altered I ſpeak of, &amp; what (agréeing with loue) is by learned men allowed, the ſame diſagréeing from the ſame, is condemned &amp; blamed.
                     9 The next law is concerning pawnes and pawne-takers. A great trade ſtill in this wringing world. And of them thus the Lord ſpeaketh. If thou take thy neighbours 
                        Ver. 26. 
                        raiment to pledge, thou ſhalt reſtore it to him before the Sun go downe: for that is his couering onely, and this is 
                        27. 
                        his garment for his skin, wherein ſhall he ſleepe? Therefore when he cryeth vnto me, I will heare him: For I am mercifull. The 24. of Deutro. is to be referred hither, for explication further of ye mercie that God requireth in this matter frō all men. Mark it &amp; euer remember it, ye 
                        nakedneſſe &amp; miſerie of the poore body cryeth againſt thée to ye Lord, and hée hath vowed to heare. All is not gained then that is put in thy purſe, but only that which is wel put in.
                     The other laws of reuerence to Magiſtrates, neither reuiling Ver. 28. &amp;c. them, nor thinking lightly of them, of due and true paying of tythes to the maintenance of Gods truth and Miniſters and ſo forth, will come hereafter to be touched againe, and therefore no more now of this Chap.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. 23.
                     
                        THis Chapter alſo as hath béen ſaid, Ver. 1. goeth on with mo Lawes, tending likewiſe to the expoſition of the Morall Law, and namely, of the 8. and 9. Commandements.
                     
                     Touching the procéeding with moe lawes, we may make vſe of theſe and the like Sayings. Arceſilaus in Laertius did not like that there ſhould be many laws, ſaying. Quemadmodum vbi multi medici, ibi multi morbi: it a vbi permultae lege
                              •
                           , ibi plus vitiorum. Like as where there are many Phiſitions, that are many diſeaſes: ſo where there are very many laws there are moe faults. Demonax
                         very vnaduiſedly ſpake againſt all lawes ſaying. Leges prorſus eſſe mutiles, Vt quibus boni non egerent, mali nihilò fierent meliores. That lawes were altogether vnprofitable, becauſe the good needed them not, the bad would not be bettered by them.
                         But Chriſoſtome with a better ſpirit, both approoued goodlaws, and would haue thē 
                        ALL to be obeied, Saying. In citharanon ſatis eſſe, in vno tantum neru
                              •
                           , concentum efficere, Vniuerſos oportere percuti &amp; numeroſè &amp; decenter: ita ad ſalutem, non ſatis eſſe vnam Legem, vniuerſas eſſe audiendas &amp; ſeruandas. To make muſicke on a Harpe, it is not ſufficient to playe on one ſting, but all muſt be ſtriken in due meaſure and proportion: ſo to ſaluation one Law is not ſufficient, but all muſt be wel vnderſtood &amp; duly kept.
                         Theſe laws therefore here following cōtinued by God himſelfe, &amp; ſeruing by explanation to helpe our vnderſtanding, &amp; conſequentlie to direct our practiſe, concerning former lawes, are dillgently by vs to be obſerued.
                     In the two firſt verſes, obſerue the vertues of a good and

                        vpright iudge, and add them to that which was ſpoken in the 18. Chap. His firſt vertue is Truth, Truth, (I ſay) in his ſentence and iudgment, which he muſt euer carefully labour for by all good waies and meanes. Contrary to truth are falſe tales &amp; rumors which therefore here in the firſt words are forbiddē either to be receaued of ye Judge, or reported by others. Thou ſhalt not receaue a falſe tale, neither ſhalt thou put thy hand with the wicked, to be a falſe witneſſe. The Word ſignifieth both to receaue and report, therefore both forbidden. That the Iudge may thus doo, he muſt euer remember Epicharmus his little ſaying, Memēto diffidere, Remēber to diſtruſt,
                         or be not too credulous; which Cicero ſo commendeth and liketh, that he doubteth not to call it the ſynews and ioints of all humane Wiſedome. It hath place in all our priuate life and actions, but eſpeciallie in iudgment. This cannot hée doo, vnleſſe he haue an other vertue included in this, namely, 
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         
                        Non prius feras ſententiam, quam vtriuſque partis cauſam cognoueris. 
                        diligence to heare both ſides, patientlie, fullie, &amp; indifferently, which euer good Iudges doo: for want whereof, how fowlie ſome haue bene caried awrie, many Stories teſtifie. That one let me remember of Apelles the Epheſian, who was accuſed to Ptolemie by his enemie Antiphilus, that he had imparted to one Theodorus treaſonable conſpiracies &amp; plots againſt the King, which Theodorus, in truth Apelles had nener ſeene in his life. The King lightlie and haſtelie gaue credit to this tale, and clapt Apelles vp with full purpoſe to execute him for it. And indeede had ſo done, if a priſoner in the ſame priſon mooued in conſcience, had not opened the whole truth &amp; acquainted Apelles: which when the King ſaw he perceiued alſo his great fault in crediting too lightly, and gaue that accuſer to Apelles, to doo with him what he would, or, as ſome write, to be his Bondman for euer. Iudges, therefore, muſt beware of this great fault, and heare euer the defence of the accuſed. Now becauſe we be not al Iudges,
                        
doth not this law concerne vs? yes, yes, your owne heart can tell you, if they muſt not receiue them, we muſt not tell them, raiſe them, and coyne them. If we do, the Lord ſéeth it and marketh it; and although they wiſely auoid the ſnare of them, and ſet frée the accuſed and ſlaundered; 
                           Rumor est ſermo ſine authore, cui malitiaded it initium, credulitas incrementum, &amp; deus tantū finem. yet God remaineth a ſwift Iudge and verie ſure to conſume ſuch wretches, who ſo againſt his lawe haue wrought euill againſt their neighbour and brother. If we may not raſhly ſmite and kill wt the hand, although he be a thiefe, no more with the tongue although it be true, for charitie hideth a multitude of faults. The phraſe moueth Fama malum, quo non aliud velocius vllum. 
                        me, and therefore I note it, that (if God ſo pleaſe) it may moue you alſo. Thou ſhalt not put thy hand with the wicked, to be a falſe or cruell witneſſe. If to giue the hearing be in ſome meaſure to put to the hand, ſurely to haue an itching eare to heare euil reportes of our Chriſtian brethren, with delight &amp; contentment to beléeue them wholy or half, &amp; to report thē againe, is to put to the hand much more, and to be grieuouſly guiltie before God. Yet what ſo common in our mouthes, as, I am not the author, I am not the firſt rayſer, I heard it, I haue my author, and ſo forth? God that made this law againſt receiuing knoweth, hearing goeth before receiuing, &amp; if not receiue, then not heare, not beleeue, not report to others. For he ſhal bée thy Iudge, who will not be mocked with ſhifts. How many men ſatiſfie their owne conſciences herein, I know not, when they heare with gréedines, and haue their inſtruments laid abroad for that purpoſe, neuer imparting to the partie what they heare, that he may anſwere it, but kéeping all cloſe from him, and thinking what they pleaſe. I know there may be ſome reaſon to conceale the accuſer, but to conceale the accuſaſion, I know none. For if they will heare with one eare, let them heare with the other 
                           Pro. vt aquilo Pluuias. in the name of God, the wrong ſide being as broad as the right; and after two or three accuſations cléered, they will better know both the accuſer and accuſed to their

owne good. Would God this fault were not where it leaſt ſhould be, and where the ſinne of it is as well knowen, as others féele the iniurie. Till it be amended, let the childe of God ſay with Dauid, O God of my righteouſneſſe:
                         
                        Pſal. 4. 1. Pſal. 135. 24. and againe, God thou knoweſt mine innocencie, and my faults are not hid from thee. To thee, therefore I flie, as knowing all both my good and my bad, and in thy knowledge I reſt, be it vnto me as thou wilt. I know thou haſt meanes to humble Dauid, and what thou doeſt ſhall be euer good in the end. After a cloude the ſunne breaketh foorth, and the weather cleareth and is more comfortable.
                     2 After Truth and diligence to attaine to it by hearing both ſides, the Lord alſo requireth in a good Iudge, Skilfulneſſe in the law, &amp; Conſtancie: ſaying in the next verſe: Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to do euill, neither agree in a controuerſie to decline after many, &amp; ouerthrow 
                        Verſ. 2. 
                        the truth. Skilfulneſſe in law to giue a right ſentence, not fitting the line to the ſtone, but the ſtone to the line. The line is fitted in the ſtone, when the multitude is followed to doe euill, than the which multitude nothing is more mutable and vncertaine. The ſtone is fitted to the line, when ſentence is giuen according to law and truth, that the Iudge hauing his name of Iuſtice, his name and his actions muſt agrée. Conſtancie ſtayeth the Iudge skilfull to diſcerne right, and to doo what hee diſcerneth, 
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                            inquit. Plato. notwithſtanding any company gainſaying it, and therefore is Conſtancie alſo required in him. Now if this may not be done in ciuil matters, whoſe heart will not tell him, much leſſe may it be done in religion, and matters of Verſ. 2. Auguſt. in Pſal. 19. Multitudo non ſequenda. Lib. 1. de Ciuitate Dei. Vulgi iudicium errore plenum.
                         faith. The wordes are playne. Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to doe euill, therefore a multitude may erre and doe euill. Neyther decline after many to ouer-throw truth, therefore a multitude may ouerthrowe truth. And how then can it bee a rule to guide my conſcience by, either in ciuill or eccleſiaſticall matters?

O weigh it well and with a religious heart, and let neither poperie tell you of multitude, nor Anabaptiſts of fewnes and paucitie, but euer looke you for truth, be they many or few, and let that be the iſſue. For proofe, there is too much to be recited now, that many may erre, and many holde truth, therefore neither the one number, nor the other any rule to a Chriſtian conſcience.
                     3 The next vertue in a Iudge is equalitie, which is oppoſed

Equalitie giues like vnto like according to one rule certaine, from which there muſt be no departing a haires breadth, for any qualities in men, as wealth or pouertie, and ſuch like. On the contrarie part, reſpect of perſons giues to like vnlike, to like cauſes vnlike and differing iudgements, for qualities in the partie, corruptly carying the Iudge his affections. As Alexander the Great more reſpected Epheſtio nothing ſo well deſeruing, than Craterus a valiant Gentleman, and right well deſeruing of the common-wealth. This equalitie, and indifferencie God requireth, that it may expreſſe his nature vpright and indifferent to all men, eyther in accuſing them by his lawe, or ſauing them vpon repentance by his Goſpell, in neither of which, he reſpecteth any mans perſon. Which, as it is a iuſt terror if we do euill, how great ſoeuer we bée: ſo is it as iuſt a comfort, if we turne from it, be we neuer ſo ſmall, poore, wretched, vile and miſerable. Remember Saint Peters words in the tenth Chapter of the Actes. If Iudges will be frée from reſpect of perſons, then needes muſt they be free from giftes, for giftes will lead their affections will they nill they, the olde ſaying being true, Beneficium accepiſti? libertatem amiſisti. Haſt thou receiued a gift? then haſt thou loſt thy libertie and freedome:
                         All this is contained in the words ot the text. Thou ſhalt not eſteeme a poore man in his cauſe. And if al Iudges followed this courſe, Heſiodus ſhould not néede to feigne, that Aſtraea hath left the ſocietie Verſ. 3. 6. &amp;c. 7. 8. of men &amp; is flowen vp to heauen. But it is to be feared, that

as Uliſſes ſeruants,
                         when he was aſléepe, opened a bottle which Aeolus had giuen him, wherein the windes were all incloſed, and ſo let the windes out, they thinking there was treaſure in the bottle, which as well at ſea, as at land they loued: ſo ſome Iudges opening mens purſes 
                        Read Deutro. 17. Chap. whileſt they looke for gaine, let truth eſcape from them to their owne hurt, and the Common-wealthes. If any do ſo, God make his word profitable to them, and ſo I leaue them to him.
                     4 It followeth in the text. If thou ſee thine enemies 
                        Verſ. 4. 
                        Oxe or his Aſſe going aſtray, thou ſhalt bring him to him againe. If thou ſee thine enemies Aſſe lying vnder his 
                        5. 
                        burden, wilt thou ceaſe to helpe him? thou ſhalt helpe him vp againe with it. Let vs heere remember that Gods actions are after two ſortes, generall, and particular. Generall to all men, Particular to his friends: So muſt ours be, taking our preſident from him. As therefore by his generall Action he ſuffereth his Sun to ſhine vpon the bad, 
                        Mat. 5 45. 
                        aſwell as vpon the good, and ſuch like: ſo muſt we extend our loue, which is the common bond of mankinde, as well to our enemies, as to our friends. By which common loue, all hurting of the bodies, or goods, wiues, or children of our enemies, without iuſt and neceſſarie cauſe is forbidden, and contrariwiſe the law of nature to be obſerued. Quod tibi non nocet, &amp; alteri prodeſt praeſtandum. What hurteth not thee, and profiteth an other is to be performed.
                         From which fountaine of this generall loue ſpring many lawes, and by name this bringing back our enemies ſtraying Oxe, and helping vp his oppreſſed beaſt. That alſo, Deut. 20. 19. which you read in Deuteronomie, of not deſtroying the fruit trees in the enemies ground, which they did beſiege, becauſe there is vſe of ſuch trees. Againe, as God hath his ſpeciall action to his friends &amp; to his Church, namely Sanctification: ſo muſt friendſhip, which is our ſpeciall 
                        Gal. 6 10. 
                        Action, reach it ſelfe but to ſuch, as are of the houſeholde of faith, and our friends. For although we muſt

                        loue with that generall loue all mankinde, Turkes, Pagans, &amp;c. Yet to ſuch may we not be friends and familiars, but muſt beware inward and vſuall conuerſation with them that hate God, and all his graces. Both theſe are conteyned in that rule of Chriſt, Be ſimple as Doues, and 
                        Mat. 10. 16. 
                        wiſe as Serpents: for by the Doues ſimplicitie is meant, we ſhould learne to hurt no bodie, but, as neere as wee can; be helpfull to all; &amp; by the Serpents wiſedome that we ſhould yet know to put a difference betwixt the houſhold of faith and Gods enemies, betwirt the religious &amp; prophane, betwixt the godly and the wicked. By this diſtinction, 
                        Iere. 15. 19. you may ſee better the meaning of that Scripture, Loue your enemies. Concerning this helping vp of 
                        Mat. 5. 44. 
                        our enemies beaſt, vnder his burden, fallen, I pray you Verſ. 5. marke, if the margent of your Bible note it not wel. That, if God commaund vs to helpe our enemies Aſſe vnder his burden, will he euer ſuffer vs to throw down our brethren with heauie burdens? It reacheth to many thinges wherein is hard dealing, if you thinke of them.
                     
                        Thou ſhalt not ouerthrow the right of thy poore in 
                        Verſ. 6. 
                        his ſuite. Before verſ. 3. he commaunded that a poore man ſhould not be ſpared for pittie: Héere now he enioyneth, that a poore man ſhould not be wronged in reſpect of his pouertie: ſuch equall ſteppes would God haue Iudgement to walke in.
                     
                        Thou ſhalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wiſe, and peruerteth the words of the righteous. The equitie of this lawe, was ſéene by the dimme eye of Nature, for Verſ. 8. the Romanes (as appeareth by the lawes of their twelue Tables) Uſed to puniſh that Iudge with death, which was conuicted to take a Bribe for giuing iudgement. Diocleſian

                         Now corruption and giftes (as One ſaith) are

Innocentius
                         reprooueth corrupt Iudges with theſe words: Vos non attendit is merit acauſarum ſed perſonarū, non iura ſed munera, non quod ratio dictet ſed quod voluntas affectet, non quod liceat ſed quod lubeat: Nunquam enim vobis eſt tam ſimplex oculus, vt totum corpus ſit lucidum: Pauperum cauſam cum mora negligitis, Diuitum cauſam cum instantia promouetis, &amp;c. Aliquid ſemper admittitis fermenti quototam maſſam corrumpitis. In giuing iudgement, YOV reſpect not the worth of the cauſes but of the perſon, not the lawes but gifts, not what reaſon doth counſail but what the wil doth affect, not that which is lawfull in it ſelfe, but that which is pleaſing to your ſelues: For your eye is neuer ſo ſingle that the whole bodie might be light: Poore mens cauſes with prolonging delay you neglect, rich mēs cauſes with inſtant earneſtnes you ſet forward, &amp;c. You alwaies mingle ſome leauen which corrupteth the whole lumpe.
                     
                     5 The law of mercie to ſtrangers verſ. 9. hath béene touched Verſ. 9. before, &amp; therefore obſerue next, this law of Reſt to the ground, the 7. yeare for the reliefe &amp; comfort of the poore. Six yeares ſhalt thou ſow thy land, and gather the fruits of 
                        Verſ. 10. 
                        it, the 7. yeare thou ſhalt let it reſt &amp; lie ſtil that the poore of thy people may eate, and what they leaue, the beaſts of

In like maner thou ſhalt doe with thy vineyard, &amp; with thy oliue trees: with great profit we may note &amp; ſée this gracious care which the Lord our God hath ouer all his creatures, &amp; learne, as our power and places giue vs leaue, to follow his example. To the poore now in

the land you ſée his loue, and you read his law here with your eyes. Why ſhould it not worke a good effect in your heart during your life in this matter? Firſt, it is his will we ſhould with hand ſhew our heart both to him, and to our poore and needie brethren, and without deeds vaine are our words that we loue one another, Secondly, his recompence is great in them that doo it, and neuer faileth. Whoſoeuer giueth but a cup of colde water, ſhall not looſe his reward. Come ye bleſſed of my father, and poſſeſſe

                        promiſes of god vnto their obedience, I will onely ſay this: that theſe great &amp; ſwéete promiſes are as honie, till we thinke of the Condidion, to wit, perfect obedience, but then we fall from all hope, had we not a Chriſt, becauſe ſuch perfect obedience to the lawe we cannot performe. Chriſt therefore we flye to, and relye vpon him, who hauing performed that obedience

                        IN this Chapter, firſt note how Moſes alone aſcendeth vp to God, and let it remember vs that there are differences of graces, and yet

                        one ſpirit the giuer of all. They that have more, may not deſpiſe them which haue leſſe; neither they which haue leſſe, enuie them which haue more. Read the 1. Cor. 12. Chapter, &amp;c. what if we ſay that the Lawe was fignified in Moſes going to God, becauſe it is holy &amp; iuſt, but it bringeth not his companie with it, becauſe they are imperfect kéepers?
                     2 Moſes came and tolde the people all the wordes of the Lord, &amp;c.
                         So is the duetie of a faithfull Miniſter, ſtill Verſ. 3. 
                        to receiue of the Lord, and to deliuer to his people what 
                        1. Cor. 11. 23. 
                        he hath receiued, not any dregges or droſſe of mans inuention, for in vaine doe men worſhip him with mens precepts, &amp;c. All the things which the Lord hath ſaid, will we doe. Concerning his raſh and confident anſwere of the people, note and remember the cenſure of learned men, that you may profit by it to a warier kinde of ſpeaking out of a true féeling of your owne and all mens frailtie of nature, by the corruption entred into vs at our fall in our firſt parents. Saint Hierome condemning ſuch 
                           Chap 24. ver. 3 Hierony: in cap. 5 Eccleſiafles. vndiſcréet haſtines ſaith. Melius eſt non promittere, quam promiſſanon facere: &amp; melius eſt ancipitem diu deliberari ſententiam, quam in verbis eſſe facilem, in operibus difficilem. It is better not to promiſe, thā not to keep promiſe: &amp; it is better for a doubtful thing to be long deliberated on, thā to grant it eaſily, &amp; performe it hardly. Gregorie againe oberſuing Greg. Moral. 31. cap. 19. 
                        this fault in the Iews, ſaith, Iudaeorū populū 
                           locuſtae ſignificabant ſubitos ſaltus dantes, &amp; protinus adterram sadentes:

Saltus enim dabant, cū 
                           praecepta Domini ſe implere promitterent, ad terram cadebant, cum factis denegarent. The people of the lewes were ſignified by the Locuſtes which vſed ſodainly to leape vp, and forth with to fall downe to the earth againe: They did (as it were) leape vp, when in words they promiſed to do all things which the Lord had ſaid, but they fell to the earth againe, when in their deeds they denied the ſame.
                         Let vs therefore (I ſay) alwaies weigh our weakneſſe, and accordingly frame our promiſes, for (as we ſée in this people) we may purpoſe well that, which we cannot ſo well performe.
                     3 Moſes wrote all the words of the Lord,
                         as a ſure and ſafe way to kéepe them. Tradition by word from man to man fayled in faithfulneſſe, and brought in many errors vnder the name of Gods word and will. Therefore writing was deuiſed by God himſelfe, and ſo his appointed inſtruments directed by him, haue left vnto vs his holy Scriptures. This matter hath beene largely intreated of by many.
                     4 This couenant made by 
                           Theophilact. in Hebr 9. Quamobrem Liber &amp; Populus aſpergitur? Nimirū, vt pretioſu ſanguinem praefiguret, quo ſumus ipſi, &amp; corda haec noſtra, aſperſi, quae profecto nobis pro codicibus inſunt. Verſ. 5. 6 7 8 a Populus obedientiam ſpondet

                        bloud, was a figure of the precious bloud of the immaculate Lambe Chriſt Ieſus, with which we muſt be ſprinkled to make vs cleane. The ninth Chapter to the Hebrewes will be an expoſition to this place. The promiſe of the people here againe to obey a God in all things, teſtifieth their heart, but not an abilitie to doe it. Therefore let vs learne ſuch affection, but gather no error from ſuch places of mans power to fulfill the ſame.
                     5 The Aſcention of Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu with ſeuentie of the Elders, together with the viſion, was a gracious confirmation of Moſes his authoririe,
                         and of his lawe giuen. But we muſt know, that it was farre from the Maieſtie of God which they ſaw, no fleſh being able to ſee him as he is, onely a glimſe for their comfort hee vouchſafed in ſuch manner as the Text expreſſeth.
                     
                        
6 After Moſes aſcendeth alone,
                         yet ſo, that he leaueth Aaron and Hur with them, that whoſoeuer had any matter 
                        Verſ. 14. 
                        might come to them, ſo watchfull and faithfull was Moſes in his place, that without iuſt cauſe he is not abſent, and then he leaueth able Deputies. Such care in Miniſters now adaies would God bleſſe, and the contrarie fault, as he is God, he will ſeuerely puniſh.
                     7 Moſes aſcending is couered with a cloud,
                         and not Verſ. 16. admitted to God till after ſixe daies, to teach all fleſh patiently and reuerently to tarrie Gods leaſure and gracious pleaſure, for any matter of his will to be reuealed to them not curiouſly ſearching, but humbly waiting for the thing we ſéeke being fit for vs. At the ende of the ſixe daies, euen the ſeuenth day God called vnto Moſes,
                         and he is admitted to ſpéech, and I pray you marke how? couered with a cloud, for the Text ſaith, Hee entered 
                        Verſ, 18. 
                        into the middeſt of the cloud, and went vp to the Mountaine. So will the Lord haue a comfortable time for all thoſe that waite for him, and the knowledge of him in his word. They ſhall ſée and heare at laſt, what he will ſay vnto them. For their hearts he will touch, their eares he will bore or open, and they ſhall ſee with their eyes, heare with their eares, and vnderſtand with their hearts to eternall life. But how? they muſt come to God in the Cloud, couered with it, &amp;c. that is, in the humanitie of Chriſt, whereof this Cloud was a figure. For w
                           •
                        thout him there is no acceſſe to God, and by him we come and that boldly. He is become fleſh of our fleſh and bone of our bone. Search without him, &amp; be oppreſſed of Maieſtie; ſearch by him, &amp; be comforted with mercy. Kiſſe the Sonne and feare not. The ſight of the glorie of the Lord was like conſuming fire on the top of the moū
                           taine, in the eyes of ye 
                        children of Iſraell (ſaith your Chapter) but to them whom he drew to him, he appeared as a pleaſant Saphir, verſ. 10. Certainly, euen ſo to carnal men, and to ſuch as are his, called by his holy Spirit, there is a

great difference of him; the one ſeeing but feare and trembling, the other ſéeing, féeling, and taſting ioy, ſwéetnes, comfort, and gladnes, aboue that which mans pen can lay downe, or his narrow heart once conceiue.
                     
                        Laſtly, Moſes was in the Mount fortie daies and fortie nights without meat or drinke, when as God could haue diſpatched him in a moment. All to giue authoritie to him and his lawe, as hath béene ſaid, &amp; that the people might ſée in his long abſtinence the diuine power of God, and ſo euer eſtéeme of the thing wherein they ſaw no earthly courſe held. Let it teach vs, ſtill and euer to reuerence Gods miniſters, to whom he hath reuealed his will for our good. They are now his meanes, as then Moſes was, and by his word he hath graced them, as here he did Moſes by theſe miracles. He that heareth you (ſaith hée) heareth mee, and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth mee. Thus much briefely of this Chapter.

                           2 What they ſhould offer?
                           3 With what heart and minde?
                           4 To what vſe and purpoſe?
                           5 To what vſe ſhould the Sanctuarie ſerue? viz. that God might dwell there.
                           6 Of what faſhion it ſhould be? viz. Like the patterne that Moſes ſaw, &amp;c.
                        
                     
                     1 The commaundement to offer is expreſſed in theſe words, Then the Lord ſpake vnto Moſes ſaying, Speake 
                        Ver. 1. 
                        vnto the children of Iſraell, that they receiue an offering for me of euery man, &amp;c. The vſe and profit whereof to vs 2 may be this. Firſt, to obſerue, how although the Lord The firſt vſe.
                         haue no neede of any mans goods, whatſoeuer it is that wée poſſeſſe in this world, becauſe the whole earth is his and all that is in it; yet his pleaſure is ſometimes to ſéeke theſe things, and ſo to make men as it were his helpers in ſuch workes as he will haue done, that thereby hee may euen honour his creature with a great fauour, and take occaſion vpon our readie &amp; willing performance of what he ſéeketh, to heape more and more fauours vpon vs. Remember with your ſelfe the 50. Pſalme. I will take no

As for example, could not he relieue a poore man himſelfe, or make of poore rich, all the honors in the world being diſpoſed by him? yet you ſée he will not, but ſendeth him to you and others for a morſell of bread and meat, that you being his inſtruments, he may take occaſion to reward you. So in all other workes of charitie and pietie wherein your purſe is vſed, ſurely if he had not a purpoſe to benefit you, hee would paſſe you ouer, and do the thing without you.

For to this end alſo pleaſed it God to appoint ſuch ſeuerall things, that poore and meane perſons might be able to offer, and no man exempted for want of power, ye verie pooreſt being able to offer goates haire, and that their meane gift to him was as welcome as the greater gifts of the rich.

O hatefull pride in this behalfe, too much, too much in ſome that ſhould be wiſer, &amp; neuer ſince ye world was, more than now. We trudge frō place to place to féede our fancies, we chooſe, wée iudge, wée cenſure, wée ſhoote our boltes in euery corner, neuer remembring this and other places telling vs of the ſeuerall powers of men, and GOD his good acceptance of the meaneſt. Let it mend, and let it end before God end vs and al this pride to our laſting paine. Joy in them that bring any offering to this worke, béeing the beſt they are able, and knowe it as true as any thing is true, that the harmeleſſe ſimplicitie of ſome ſhepeheards in the olde Church did ſometimes more profit the Church, than the great, exquiſite, &amp; fine, or delicate (but a little too proud) Cōfeſs.

If we cannot attaine to be In primis, to haue the firſt place, yet it is praiſe worthy if wée may haue the ſecond, or the third. In the building of the Temple after this Tabernacle, they that laide the foundacions, nay, that digged places to lay the firſt ſtone in, that hewed and ſquared the ſtone and the timber, were of leſſe reputation and account, than thoſe that carued &amp;

guilded the Temple: yet was the others worke and labour far more neceſſarie.

They offered their earerings and Iewelles, which were ornaments to them, and obſerue their zeale, learning by it that nothing ought to be ſo deare vnto vs, which we cannot finde in our hearts to beſtow willingly to the ſeruice and honour of God.

                     3. But with what hart were theſe offerings to be made? The Lord alſo expreſſed that, when he ſaide: Whoſe hart

giueth it freely, v.

                        of a willing heart let him bring this offering to the Lord. Againe v. 21. And euery one whoſe hart incouraged him or lifted him vp, and euery one whoſe ſpirit made him willing. And v. 22. as many as were free harted, &amp;c. By all 22 which Repetitions, you ſée what an eye God hath euer to the heart of one that dooth any thing to him, yea although the thing it ſelfe be commaunded, as héere ſuch offerings were. Forced ſeruice God regardeth not, but will haue euer our wil concurre cheerefully, &amp; hartelie. Wherfore in that Great offering of Dauid and the people towards the building of the Temple which Salomon built, note it and marke it diligently what a mention is made of ſuch a hart, as well as of ſuch &amp; ſuch gifts. The people reioiced whē
                         
                        1. Chron. 29. 9.

O my God thou tryeſt, I know, the heart and haſt pleaſure in righteouſneſſe: I haue offered willingly in rhe vprightneſſe of mine heart all theſe things: I haue alſo found thy people which are here, to haue offered willingly with ioy. The Apoſtle alſo witneſſeth, that God loueth a cheerefull giuer, and what is done grudgingly, that is, with a ſparing &amp; 2. Cor. 9. 7. nigardly hart, or of neceſſity, that is, againſt a mans will as loth to be euill reported off; all that, be it whatſoeuer, ye Lord deſpiſeth and regardeth not: to which agréeth that aduiſe of the wiſe-ſon of Sirach, Giue vnto the moſt High

Such a matter in al offerings, gifts, and duties to God is willingneſſe, cheerefulneſſe, &amp; hartineſſe, making good that Saying of S.

He is able to make it felt and conſidered.
                     4 The fourth point is, to what end theſe offerings 
                        Vt faciant MIHI Sanctuarium, non idolis, non ſibi, ſed MIHI &amp;c.
                         ſhould be? euen for a Sanctuarie ſaith the Text, that is, for a place to offer Sacrifices in, and to heare the lawe in, as wée now ſpeake to make a Church. For this Sanctuarie was in ſteade of a Church vnto them till Salomon built the glorious Temple, The fauorites of Rome often obiect to the Profeſſors of the Goſpell, that we haue no Churches built by any of our Religion &amp;c. To whom true anſwere is made, that firſt our bodies are the Temples of the holy Ghoſt, &amp; therefore were there no other Temples 
                        1. Cor. 6. 19. than theſe, yet God might dwell in vs, and we be his. Secondlie, this people of the Iewes, and our Forefathers 
                        2454. yeares. had no ſuch Churches as now be, but worſhipped ye true God in Tabernacles or tents in the wildernes before this Sāctuarie was made, &amp; then in this Sanctuarie, which was moueable alſo frō place to place. Thirdly, Jeſus Chriſt in Math. 11. ye 
                        Mountaines, in Ships, &amp; ſuch like places taught the people, &amp; they heard his word &amp; beléeued. Iohn Baptiſt in the priſon preached Chriſt, and that was his Church. Paul did like, &amp; begat diſciples to Chriſt in his bands. He preached 
                        Act. 28. 30. &amp;c. 
                        &amp; taught two yeares together in his owne houſe hired in Rome. Thereupō it hath bin ſaid yt our Fathers (true godly men indéed) had dark Churches &amp; light harts, afterward counterfet Chriſtians had ſhining Churches, and darke 
                        Auentinus.
                        
harts. Men became like ye Diſciples of Chriſt in that error of theirs, when they ſo gazed vpon, delighted in, and doted vp ō the outward forme and matter of ye 
                        Temple, cōming to their Maſter to ſhew him the building of the Temple, 
                        Mat. 24. Mar. 13. and ſaying to him, Maiſter, ſee what manner ſtones, and what manner buildings are here, how it was garniſhed with goodly ſtones, and with conſecrate things. To whom Chriſt anſwered: Are theſe the things that ye look vpon? 
                        Luke. 21. 6. As if he ſhould haue ſaide, this is but lightneſſe in you to eye ſo much theſe things, for they are not the things that I moſt eſtéeme: And therefore the time will come, when not one ſtone ſhall be left vpon an other, which ſhal not be throwen downe. Earthly temples and Churches haue an vſe whileſt God pleaſeth, but true Religion may bée without them, and God rightly ſerued if none were. But now there are Churches in the World, and did the Papiſts builde them all? No, No, Aſſuredlie the Iewes, and the Gentiles did build moſt of them, and their labours we inioye. Some peraduenture were built, or repaired by men of Romiſh Religion, Princes, Biſhops, or others; but what ſaid their great man Campion preaching at ye nerall of Sir Thomas White? Surely (ſaith he) this they did (in maxima rerum vilitate, et multorum opibus adiuti) in a time of great cheapeneſſe of euery thing, and helped with the riches of many men.
                         Thus could he ſée and ſay before diſcontentment made him Popiſh, and blinde Popery made him blinde alſo. Conſtantine the Great built Churches before euer Popery was hatched. Charles the Great built Schooles of diuinitie and Vniuerſities in Germanie, Fraunce, Italy, not for Popery, but for the Bible to be taught in, and Saint Auguſtines workes reade at their tables. Edward the third King of this Realme loued Wickleff, adorned the Vniuerſities, and ſpeaking honorablie of the bountie of Princes blameth &amp; accuſeth Epiſt. ad Clementem. de fū
                           dationibus, dotationibus, &amp;c. greatlie the ſpoile and ouerthrow of Churches by Popes. The Britans auntientinhabiters of this Nation, as Beda
                        
witneſſeth had their Churches and Temples and yet no Popery. Therefore all was not done by papiſts. The varie papiſts themſelues confeſſe the contrarie. Churches then wée haue, and not built by them, which yet if wée had not, wée might bée Gods people. Worthy perſone in our daies which haue built Colledges, inriched Cities with many ſuch other good works, would alſo haue built Churches

                              atio Dei Templum Dei facit. Thō. So ſtill becauſe in our Churches the Word is preached, the Sacraments adminiſtred, our prayers made &amp; heard, therfore God alſo dwelleth in them according to his promiſe, where two or three &amp;c. Mat. 18. 20. My houſe ſhall be called the houſe of praier Matt. 21. 13. and he that ſweareth by the gold of the Temple ſweareth by the Temple and by him that dwelleth in it. Mat. 23 21.

But becauſe there he gaue them viſible ſignes of his gratious preſence, and was not called vpon in vaine, but with effect and profit to all men that rightlie made their refuge to him, therfore ſuch mercie is called euen dwelling among them. God is not changed in theſe daies, but ſtill kinde &amp; comfortable to his people. And therefore euen our Temples alſo are his houſe in which he is trulie worſhipped, and euer preſent to heare our true prayers, and to ſend vs away with his comfort as then he did. Which vſe and end of the Church is a matter of great good to all minds that rightlie and religiouſlie will meditate of it, and be inſtructed. For if it be his houſe, where he dwelleth and is preſent, if it bée the houſe of prayer and the worſhip of God, with what zeale and deſire ſhould we go to it, with what reuerence ſhould we remaine in it, and how vnwillingly depart from it before an end? What is for the decencie of it: how chéerefully ſhould we giue, and the wicked prophaners of it how ſeuerely ſhould wée puniſh? The Prophet Dauid being letted by his perſecutors, that he could not be preſent in the congregation of Gods people, grieuouſly complaineth for it, and proteſteth, that although he was ſeparated in bodie frō them, yet his heart was with them, and that after a very earneſt maner.

                        for the Temple of the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Iacob &amp;c. Thus earneſt to haue a Temple, thus earneſt to go the Temple, and thus grieued to be from the Temple was this holy King and Prophet in whom Gods Spirit ruled. Others alſo that haue zealouſly loued to go to the Church, hath God noted and chronicled in his booke, both for the incouragement of ſuch as will doo the like, and for the iuſt condemnation of all ſtubborne deſpiſers of the ſame. Anna an olde Woman that had béene Widow foure ſcore and foure yeeres the Lord hath cauſed his holy Euangeliſt to regiſter this praiſe of her, that ſhée went 
                        Luke. 2 37. 
                        not out of the Temple, but ſerued GOD with faſtings and prayers day and night. It is ſaid of old Father Simeon, 
                        Ver. 27. that he came into the Temple by the MOTION OF THE SPIRIT when the parents brought the babe Ieſus
                           
to doo for him after the cuſtome of the lawe. Gods ſpirit then moueth men to ye 
                        Church, but neuer from ye 
                        Church. The Phariſie and the Publicā went both vp into the Temple 
                        Luke. 18. 10. 
                        to pray. And ſo good a thing as to go to the Church, God wil not leaue vnnoted and praiſed in a very Phariſie. The bleſſed Apoſtles Peter &amp; Iohn went vp together into 
                        Act. 3. 1. 
                        the Temple at the ninth houre of prayer, when they might haue prayed at home, yet they would goe to the Church. Three times in the yeare, ſaid the law of God, ſhal all the males appeare before me in the place that I ſhall 
                        Deutro. 16. 16 
                        chooſe: ſtil, ſtill to kéep them in vſe, and loue, and care of ye 
                        Church, albeit they dwelled a great way off. Where you may obſerue, that although ye 
                        law reached but to ye 
                        males, becauſe God gratiouſly conſidered that ye 
                        women might be with childe, or nurſes, and not able to come, yet godly women, when they were able, and had no impediment, would go vp alſo with their huſbands, ſuch a zeale had they to the houſe of God where ye aſſemblie met to ſerue God. So went vp Anna with her husband Elcanah, when ſhee made vnto her Son Samuel a little coate, &amp; brought it vnto 
                        1. Sam. 2. 19. 
                        him from yeare to yeare. So went vp the bleſſed Virgine 
                        Luke 2. 41. Women then would go with their Husbāds: now refuſe thē
                           ſelues, &amp; hinder their Husbāds. to Hieruſalē euery yeare at the feaſt of the Paſſeouer, both of them when there were groſſe and foule corruptions. For when Anna went vp, what read you of the Sons of Heli the Prieſt? And when Mary went vp, Scribes and Phariſies and wicked Prieſts were in their ruffe. Yet they went vp and many other godly and wel diſpoſed, to teach vs euer not to fall out with God for mens faults, nor to abſent our ſelues from Church, and Church exerciſes becauſe all things are not perfect in ye 
                        Miniſters. O let men be men and full of miſeries; let God be God &amp; ful of mercy to regard &amp; reward them ye ſo loue him, &amp; cleaue vnto him, to his houſe, &amp; to his ſeruice, as for no vices &amp; faults of mē
                         they wil be plucked &amp; ſeuered frō 
                        him. To cōclude what a care had Chriſt our ſauior himſelf of Church meetings, cō

                        in the midſt of the Doctors, both hearing them, and aſking them queſtions? To teach it euer to the worldes end, that the place to ſéeke Chriſt and finde Chriſt in, is ye 
                        Church: for in other places you may miſſe of him as his Parents did, but neuer in the Church ſhall you faile if you ſéeke him duely. It is written of S. Iohn, that when he was ſo olde as he could not go to Church, he would be carried by his ſchollers &amp; friends to it. Chriſoſt. Quod apud te precatus accipere non potes &amp;c. That which praying priuately thou cāſt not obtain, go to the Church and pray there for it, and thou ſhalt obtaine. The prayers there made, ſaith S. Hierom. are like a great thūder-clap; yea like the roaring of the ſea ſaith Baſil. One ſticke maketh a fire, but many ſtickes a great and hot fire: One ſtring giueth a ſound, but many ſtrings a melodious ſoūd &amp;c. I could not therfore refraine teares, ſaith S. Austine, at

                        the hearing of the ſongs, which thy Church &amp; cōgregatiō (met together) did vſe to ſing to thee, O Lord what time I firſt began to recouer my Faith vnto thee, yea me think euen yet ſtill I feele my ſelfe rauiſhed, not with the ſinging, but with the ſweet matterwhich is ſung, &amp;c. To the Church, to ye 
                        Church then let our harts be, euer following theſe bleſſed examples laide before vs, &amp; know it well to be but a late deuiſe of the Diuell to vphold his kingdome by ſecret perſwading of people frō the Church. There is nothing in the Church but ye 
                        Scriptures of God, ye 
                        Sacramēts of God, holy praiers, holy and comfortable exhortatiōs to amendment of life drawen out of the Scriptures, all in a tongue that we vnderſtand, inſtruction of our childrē
                         &amp; ſeruants for whom wée muſt anſwere if by our negligence they be caſt away, and in one word, nothing yt may hurt or offend iuſtly a religious mind. The contrary ſpéeches are ſlaunders &amp; ſhameleſſe lies, as your ſelf may ſée, if you wil make trial. Priuate houſes &amp; holes, woods &amp; thickets,

hay-mowes &amp; barnes, night &amp; darkneſſe may pleaſe them that loue darkneſſe, &amp; walke in darkneſſe, but a good mā, &amp; a good woman will loue light, &amp; open aſſemblies, will open both eare and heart to the truth, when God knocketh, and ſtand no more wilfull againſt God, that ſo made them &amp; bought them, &amp; muſt iudge them. The next point Obſerue here alſo the ſin of the prophaners of it. Luke 1. 10. is reuerēce &amp; fit behauiour in the Church, when we come there, becauſe it is Gods houſe where he dwelleth and is preſent. In the firſt of Luke it is ſaid that the whole multitude were without in prayer, while the incenſe was burning, ſo reuerently &amp; religiouſly did they then vſe ye place. But alas, in our daies S. Chryſoſtome his complaint may Hom. 24. in Act. be taken vp. Alios videoſtare, et nugari dum preces fiunt, ne
                           
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            ſolum dumpreces fiunt, ſed et dum Sacerdos benedicit. Neſcis quod cum Angelis ſtas? cum illis cantas? cum illis Hymnos dicis? et ſtas ridens? Non mirum eſſet ſi fulmen emitteretur non ſolum in eos, ſed etiam in nos, dignaenim fulmine ſunt haec. I ſee others ſtand and trifle while prayer is ſaid, yea not onelie when prayer is ſaide, but when the Prieſt bleſſeth. Doeſt thou not know that thou ſtādeſt with the Angels, ſingeſt with the Angels, thou ſaiſt Hymns with thē, &amp; ſtandeſt thou laughing? It were no maruell if God ſhould ſēd out a thunder-bolt, not only vpon thē but vpō vs alſo, for ſurely theſe things deſerue a thūder-bolt.

                         Surely the deuout behauiour of the Iewes in the Temple, wilbe a witneſſe to condemne Chriſtians in the great day. For they to types and figures ſhewed more reuerence than wee now a dayes to the truth and body. Such in thoſe dayes as did not regarde this reuerence of the place, he whipped out, ſhewing by that baſe puniſhment,

If Moſes were commaunded to put off his ſhooes, &amp; told that it was holy ground where God appeared, we may fitly learne by it reuerently to demean our ſelues in the Church. The waſhing in the law, when they entred iuto the Tabernacle, The forbidding of burdens to be carried through the Temple, all ſhewed then, &amp; teach vs now, reuerence of Churches and holy places where Gods people are aſſembled to heare and ſerue him.

                         ſaith Chryſoſtom againe, offering vp the prayers of all, &amp; doeſt thou flire &amp; laugh fearing nothing? doeſt thou not trēble &amp; recal thy ſelfe? If thou wert about to enter into a Princes Court, thou wouldeſt order thy habit, thy look, &amp; thy gate, but ētring into the church, which is the Court of ye heauenly King, thou doeſt laugh, iangle, walke &amp; make bargaines. As a wiſe man knoweth ye 
                        difference of times &amp;

And as the ſwine putteth his filthy foote in the very ſame trough where hée putteth his mouth to take his meate: ſo the prophane Man and Woman there ſpeake to their dog, where they pray to their GOD, and ſhew no reuerence to ſo holy a place. In olde time mens houſes were their Churches, 
                        Chryſoſt. Hom. 36. in 1. Cor. but now the Churches are our houſes, yea more prophaned than our houſes, with noiſe, with babling, with gazing and ſtaring at euery one that commeth in, or goeth out, with fliring and laughing, with ſléeping, and what not that is vnfit? If we will buy and bargaine, méete at the Church; if you will brawle and brable, méete at the Church; thus, thus are we odious to God &amp; men for abuſing the houſe of Almightie God. The Prieſts of Dagō

                         their Idol brake his necke, for very reuerence; and we ſhew no reuerence in the Court of the High God, his Church and Temple. To goe in to pleaſe God and further to diſpleaſe him, and ſo to encreaſe the ſinne thou prayedſt pardon for, what a madnes is it, if it be well conſidered? Great care then let vs euer haue in the Church of God, where Father, Sonne, &amp; Holy Ghoſt behold vs, to doo nothing any way vnfitting the place. The Lord ſhall neuer ſuffer ſuch Chriſtian reuerence of his houſe want a rich and comfortable bleſſing. Let vs To repaire our Churches.
                         alſo conſider the dulneſſe of many men to adorne this houſe, to repaire it, to maintaine it, and doo theſe remember it is Gods houſe? what coſt wée beſtow on our owne dwellings who ſéeth not? and yet neuer ſhall they bee ours longer than this GOD ſhall kéepe them to vs, whoſe houſe wée thus neglect. Truly it is fearefull to ſée Mens backwardneſſe in this behalfe. Were GOD without a houſe til they built one, that will not vphold one alreadie built, it would be long. How then can they ſay

they deſire his dwelling among them, and his preſence to their comfort? No, no, they are far from féeling ye true vſe of Church méetings, that thus hardly, or not at all are drawn to any contributions for them. They taſt not what Apol cap. 19. 
                        Tertullian taſted, when he ſaid, Coit caetus, cōgregantur omnes, et quaſi manufacta praecationibus ambiunt Deumorantes. Grata haec vis eſt Deo, quod

The aſſembly commeth together, and all meeting as it were with an hoſt or band of men, they ſet vpon GOD with their ioined prayers, and the Lord accepteth well ſuch force offered vnto him, graunting commonly to that one voice of many, what he would not haue graunted to ſome of them if they had bene ſeuerall.
                         Surely as many ſtickes make a greater fire, and many ſtrings a fuller muſicke: ſo is the méeting of many in the Church to pray together, a fire of great heate, &amp; an harmonie paſſing pleaſing to the Lord. The Churches are like thoſe Cities of refuge, which God appointed among the Iſraelites, whither hee that had offended might flye &amp; finde pardon, onely thoſe Sanctuaries were for ſome kinde of faults, and the Church is for all kinde, ſo that wée heartely and vnfainedly cry, Lord forgiue, and what a comfort is this Meditation, if you follow it? Dooth the husbandman ſow, onlie for the pleaſure hée taketh to ſowe, or dooth he it to the end he may reape? Dooth the Merchant onely aduenture for a pleaſure to ſaile, or dooth hée it to gaine and get? So, ſo muſt a Chriſtian Man or Woman goe to the Church, not for the pleaſure of walking, or ſuch like, but to get and gaine ſome ſpirituall comfort and profit, which if wée doo, certainely that God, that ſéeth our harts, deſires, and driftes, will mercifully and gratiouſly anſwere the ſame to our good contentment. Let theſe things therefore increaſe our loue to the Church, to goe to it, to ſpend the time wel when we are there, and to tarrie out ye 
                        end of all diuine duties there, which laſt point S. Chriſoſtome
                        
exhorteth vnto by much perſwaſion, finding the fault euen then as it ſéemeth, which too too much aboūdeth in our Churches, namely to depart away before the end of Prayers and Sermon. Medicamentum inquit ſi tibi

A feller of a tree, if he cannot ſmite it downe at one blowe, will hee not ſmite againe and againe till it fall? So then entring into the Church, &amp; admitted to the cōpany of Chriſt, depart not away till thou be diſmiſſed. For if thou do go forth, thou ſhalt bee called for againe as a fugitiue. All the whole day thou canſt bee content to beſtow in things concerning the Bodye, and canſt thou not beſtow two houres vpon ſpirituall matters?

Wherein wée are moſt plainelie taught, that in the ſeruice and worſhip of God our deuiſes and inuentions muſt haue no place, but carefully and preciſely we muſt euer ſerue him according to his owne paterne and preſcription left vs in his holy Word. Much hath the Word of this matter, &amp; we muſt be very héedefull of it. Heare O Iſrael ſaith the Lord, the ordinances and lawes which I teach you, &amp;c. Ye ſhall put nothing to the Word which I commaund you, neither ſhall you take ought there from. Againe, ye ſhall not doo whatſoeuer ſeemeth good in your owne eyes: But to the place which the Lord your God ſhall chooſe, thither ſhall you bring all that I commaund you, &amp;c. Againe, Ye ſhall haue fringes vpon the borders of your garments &amp; put vpon the fringes of the borders a ribād of blew ſilke. That whē you looke vpon them, ye may remēber all the cōmandements of the Lord to do them, and THAT YE SEEKE NOT AFTER YOVR OVVNE HART, NOR AFTER YOVR OVVNE EYES, &amp;c. The puniſhment of tranſgreſſing in this kinde you may reade in many places in ye 
                        Old and New Teſtament. Hee that breaketh the leaſt of theſe commandements ſhall be counted the leaſt in the kingdome of God. If any man loue me, he wil keepe my Word. Then are you my friends, if you doo what I commaund you. The Apoſtle condemneth all voluntarie religion to the Coloſſians &amp; the place is worthy looking on. Therefore himſelfe expreſly mentioneth, that touching the holy Sacrament he deliuered nothing but what hee had receiued. For in vaine, in vaine, ſaith he, do we worſhip God, teaching for doctrines mens precepts. Secondly, in that God ſhewed Moſes a patterne, we may conſider that as a builder before he build a houſe, in a paper vſeth to draw ye whole plot and forme: ſo God Almightie before the ſending of his Son in our fleſh, which is ye builder of ye 
                        new Teſtament, in ye 
                        Ceremonies of ye 
                        law, as in a paper or paterne,

drew and diſcouered the manner of his worſhip and mercies and fauours in Chriſt. And as the ſame builder after he hath finiſhed the worke, taketh away and throweth downe all ſcaffoldes and proppes and ſtayes vſed before; ſo the Lord ſoone after the reſurrection of Chriſt, hauing ended the happie worke of our ſaluation, tooke away all the Moſaicall policie, with theſe Ceremonies, that onely Chriſt might be looked at, and not theſe, not ſparing that glorious materiall Temple, which if it had ſtood, neuer would or could men haue béene drawen from theſe ſhadowes to the bodie and truth of all.
                     This matter of the Tabernacle is againe ſpoken of in the 35. Chapter whither you may turne and reade that with this, out of which reading happily this Queſtion may come in your minde, why God would haue eyther now ſuich a ſumptuous Tabernacle erected, or afterward ſuch a glorious Temple? And you may anſwer thus. That becauſe the Heathen and Gentiles had all things ſo rich and coſtly in their Temples, therefore it pleaſed God to match and excéede that beautie, leaſt ignorant ſoules ſhould haue thought him leſſe worth, being ye true and euerlaſting God, than thoſe Idols, and his children and people baſer and leſſe to be regarded than thoſe Idolaters, true Religion worſe than falſe and ſo haue fallen away to their vtter conſuſion. Which alſo was ſome reaſon, why the Lord burdened them with ſuch a multitude of Ceremonies, leſt they ſhould haue leaſure to looke vnto the Gentiles, and to deuiſe new matters in imitation of them, as mans curious Nature is too apt to do. Ableſſed care of humane frailtie, and an vnſearchable goodnes to keepe man from falling. But a ſecond Queſtion ariſeth vpon this, whether now vnder the Goſpell it ſhould not be ſo alſo, ſéeing Temples of Idolaters &amp; Idolatry are now alſo very glorious to ye eye? The Anſwer is true, No. For, as S. Paule teacheth, all theſe Moſaicall Ceremonies Colloſſ. 2. 17. 
                        were but ſhadowes of things to come, and the Epiſtle
                        
to the Hebrewes plainely ſaith, that the Old Teſtament was nothing but the ſhadow of the New, which ſhadowes are vaniſhed the bodie and truth being come, as was ſaid a little before. For a time thus it pleaſed God to ſubmit himſelfe to man, &amp; to teach him by theſe things, but it was not the courſe he intended to continue. Since therefore the Iewes had a commandement, and Romiſh Idolaters now haue none, ſince thoſe things repreſented what now is come, and can no longer be repreſented as future, you ſée the caſe is farre differing, and He ſaid well that ſaid it: Tell me ye Prieſtes, what doth gold in the Church or in

                        Gods worſhip, &amp;c? Thus could the Satyricall Poet reprehend the exceſſe of the Gentiles in adorning their Churches. Exuperius
                         Biſhop of Tolouſe a citie of Narbon in France néere the Pyrene mountaines carried the Sacrament in a little wicker baſket (I meane the bread,) &amp; the wine in a glaſſe. S. Hierom writing to Nepotian inueigh eth alſo againſt too much glorie &amp; gliſtering in Churches. Saint Ambroſe likewiſe in his Offices, lib. 2. cap. 28. And when in the Councill it was argued whether golden or wooden veſſels were fit for the Temple, Boniface
                         the martyr anſwered: Cum aurei eſſent Sacerdotes, ligneos habuerunt calices, nunc lignei Sacerdotes volunt habere aureos calices. When the Prieſtes were golden, they had wooden cups, but now when the Prieſtes are wooden, they will haue golden cups.
                         Theſe things reprooue not what is fit in Churches, but condemne rightly all vnneceſſarie exceſſe and ſuperfluity, ſuch as is in Popiſh Churches at this day, and was in vſe among the Gentiles; God is now worſhipped in ſpirit and trueth. Iohn.

                        HAuing paſſed ouer the Preparation of Ceremonies and ſhadowes, now in the tenth verſe beginneth the matter it ſelfe, and firſt of the Arke. They ſhall alſo make an

                           ſigne vnto that people of God his preſence amongſt them, and therfore as in other things the name of the thing

                           ſignified is attributed to the ſigne, ſo is it in this. For you read Dauids words ſo, when he ſent to fetch the Arke of God. WHOSE NAME IS CALLED BY THE NAME 
                           2. Sam. 6. 2. Numb. 10. 35. 1. Sam. 3. 5. 
                           OF THE LORD OF HOSTES, THAT DVVELLETH BETVVEEN THE CHERVBIMS. And in the Booke of Numbers, when the campe remooued they ſpake to it as to God. Vp Lord and let thine enemies be ſcattered. &amp;c. Secondly, as men are apt and prone to abuſe outward ſignes and Sacraments, tying God to them, and too much truſting in them: ſo did the Iſraelites abuſe this Arke. For in the time of Heli yt 
                           Prieſt, when they had war with the Philiſtines and were put to the worſe, ſtreight way they ſent for the Arke out of Shiloh, and alledge this reaſon, That it might ſaue them out of the hands of their enemies. And when it came into the hoſt they ſhouted a mightie ſhout, ſo that the earth rang againe, when God was not tied to the Arke, but could be preſent with them without it, neither could the outward matter of the Arke profit them. So abuſe ſome men yt 
                           words of the Scripture, as of S. Iohn his Goſpel, hanging thē about their necks, and putting truſt in yt 
                           outward words, whereof S. Chryſoſtom much complaineth, if that be his work vpon Mathew which is aſcribed to him. Thus in our time is ye 
                           Sacrament of the Lords bodie abuſed, by carying the outward ſignes vp &amp; down on horſback, &amp; foot, and giuing that to the ſigne which is proper to the thing ſignified. Thirdly, for yt 
                           Name you may obſerue, it is called the Arca foederis. 1. Sam. 4. 3. Arca Teſtamenti Arca Teſtimonij. Aug. lib. 10. de ciuit. cap. 17. Teſtimonii arcā

                           Arke of the Couenāt, the Arke of the Teſtament, &amp; the Arke of the Teſtimonie.
                            The reaſon, becauſe in this Arke was ye 
                           law kept written in the two tables, which law is called ye 
                           book of the Couenāt Exo. 24. 7. or ye 
                           Teſtament of God, Pſal. 78. 10. or the Teſtimonies of God. pſ. 119. Bleſſed are they that keep his Teſtimonies: I haue had as great delight in the way of thy Teſtimonies, as in all maner of riches.
                            And in this Chapter, Thou ſhalt put in the arke, the Teſtimonie which I ſhal giue thee. v. 16. for the like cauſe alſo ſhall you read the whole Tabernacle called

the Tabernacle of the Couenant or of the Teſtimonie becauſe Tabernaculum ſoederis, ſiue Teſtimonij. Beda. Arca de lignis Sittim ſig. corp.

                                 que

Rupertus obſeruauit eam eſſe menſuram arcae quae hominis ſtaturam non excedit, &amp; quam homines porrectis manibus in longitudine amplecti queant, vt oſtendatur acceſsibilem eſſe atque attrectabilem intus atque foris. Verſ. 12. 13. 14 15 Numb. 4. 5. it contayned this Arke wherein the lawe was. Fourthly, for ye 
                           ſignificatiō
                            ſome make this Arke a figure of Chriſt and reſemble it thus. The wood wherof the Ark was made, was Sittim wood, a durable and laſting wood, not ſubiect to wormes and corruption as other wood is: ſo repreſenting and ſhadowing the humanitie of Chriſt, whoſe bodie in the graue felt no corruption or putrifaction as other mens fleſh and bodies doe, neither was ſubiect to ſinne. That wood was ouerlaid with pure gold both within and without: ſo ſhadowing out the diuine nature of Chriſt vnited to his manhood, the incomprehenſible excellencie whereof, wee haue nothing heere in earth more precious than Gold to reſemble, and yet euen in that no compariſon. The crowne of gold that went about it ſhadowed the Maieſtie of his kingdome of which ſo great things are ſpoken in the Scripture. The Ringes and the Barres by which the Arke was carried, were ſhadowing figures of the preaching of the Goſpell, by which Chriſt is caried &amp; borne from place to place through the world, as his owne diuine will ſhall appoint. The Barres remained euer in the Rings, &amp; might not be taken out, ſo figuring that preaching &amp; Chriſt muſt not be ſeuered, but euer be together. Wherefore whoſoeuer teacheth &amp; preacheth mans merits as eyther wholly or partly the cauſe of ſaluation, y• Preacher &amp; Teacher pulleth the Barres out of ye 
                           Rings &amp; ſeuereth them from the Arke, a thing forbidden &amp; vnlawfull, offending God, hurting eternally the partie ſo doing, without vndeſerued mercie. The Arke muſt be carried onely by the Leuites, and not by euerie Tribe; ſo is there a calling ſtill to the preaching of the word, and euerie man indifferently may not do it: thoſe Leuites were able to carrie the Arke, and ſo ſhould men called to the Miniſterie be able to preach in ſome meaſure, though not in like meaſure, as neither had the Leuites like bodily Math. 25. 15. ſtrength, neither had like burdens impoſed vpon them.

They were alſo willing and carefull to do what they were able and commaunded to do; and certainly euen ſo ſhould it be in preaching: power and paines ſhould goe to gether, otherwiſe the ſinne is as great now, as it ſhould haue béen then, in that kind of bearing that material Arke the figure and ſhadow of Chriſt and of this bearing of him before our brethren, if it had béene then neglected eyther for want of ſtrength or will. Hence are the Miniſters called the pillars of the Church. A thing not ſo deepely conſidered of many Miniſters as it ſhould, and as I pray God make it to be. To the calling we come of carying the Arke, but from the paines many runne, and let the Arke alone. It will not euer be borne of a iuſt God, and therefore happie he that returneth ſooneſt to his office. This Arke, as hath beene ſaid, was a ſigne of Gods preſence, ſo that when the Arke was there, God was thought to be there, but how much more is Ieſus Chriſt the cauſe that God is preſent with vs? from whom our ſinne had ſo ſeuered Hebr. 9. 4.

                            vs, as where we were hee would not bee, and where hee was wee could not be. In this Arke was the lawe, to ſhadow how Chriſt for vs ſhould vndergoe the lawe, ſatiſfie and fulfill it in all points, and ſo free and deliuer vs from it. There was the pot of Manna ſhadowing that Chriſt ſhould be the true bread from Heauen nouriſhing to eternall life all thoſe that faithfully feede vpon him. And thirdly there was Aarons rod that budded,
                            ſo to repreſent the Prieſthood of Christ for euer. (after the order of Melchiſedech) and his Reſurrection, who being dead liued againe, as Aarons rod
                            dead and drie budded and bare againe. Finally, where the Arke was, there was it lawfull to ſerue God, and not in euerie place; and where Chriſt is, there is the Church, and without him, no ſeruice nor labour acceptable, in whom and by whom only we can pleaſe. What an excellent figure then was this Arke of Chriſt, and how rightly, though ſome-what obſcurely (for ſo then it pleaſed God to deale) did it

lay before the Iewes their future Meſſiah? Others haue made it a figure of the Church and followed the application that way. As for the name, the Arke, as you haue heard, was called the Arke of his Couenant; and what is the true Church but the people of his Couenant, that is, a peculiar flocke and companie choſen of God, with whom he hath made a gracious league and couenant as you read in Eſay, The mountaines ſhall remooue, and the hilles ſhall fall downe; but my mercie ſhall not depart

A comfortable meditation in all the ſtormes and ſtirres of the Church Militant here on earth, to looke and runne vnto this Couenāt which ſhal neuer faile, becauſe God is true, and to conſider that whatſoeuer men be, or do, or threaten to do, the Church dependeth not vpon men nor their fauours, or leagues, or promiſes, but vpon Gods couenant with it, euen the Almightie maker of all ye worlds Maſſe, who bloweth vpon all earthly Potentates and they periſh, who ſaueth not with bow and ſpeare, but with his word and will, no confederacies of men being able to indure his wrath.

peace, which by no power of the Deuill or his members ſhall euer be made fruſtrate. And to this Couenant I flye in all my feares, ſéeking no vnlawfull meanes, but remembring comfortably the words ſpoken, Quoniam in me sperauit, liber abo eum; protegam eum, quia cognouitnomen meum, &amp;c.

So, whether we apply it as a figure of Chriſt, or of the Church, you ſée the conſideration of this Arke may yéeld vs many good meditations.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Mercie Seate.
                        THe Arke, as you may ſée, had a couer appointed to be made for it, which was the Mercie Seate or the Propitiatorie. The wordes of your Bible are thus. Alſo thou ſhalt make a Mercie ſeate of pure gold two cubits 
                           Verſ. 17. 
                           and a halfe long, and a cubit and a halfe broad. And thou ſhalt make two Cherubims of gold, &amp;c. How notable a figure againe this was of Chriſt, I pray you ſée; for 18 
                           firſt, it was the couer of ye 
                           Ark where the law of Moſes lay:

and who hideth and couereth vs from the wrath of God, and from the accuſation of the lawe but Ieſus Chriſt? He is like a coole ſhadow to flie vnto in the ſcorching heat of Gods deſerued diſpleaſure, which is a conſuming fire. And were it not for him, vp would the law riſe againſt vs Hebr. 12. 29. with his heauie curſe, and crie for condemnation againſt vs for our manifolde breaches and contempts, which no fleſh is able to abide. Wherupō the Pſalmiſt ſaith, O Lord, O Lord, if thou wilt marke what is done amiſſe, who, 
                           Pſal. 130. 3. 
                           who is able to indure it? But do not thou, O Lord, enter into iudgement with thy ſeruant (to wit, without this

                           mercie ſeat, couer, or propitiatorie) for without Chriſt thy Sonne repreſented and ſhadowed héereby, ſhall no fleſh be iuſtified in thy ſight.

Thinke you then of it for euer, and lay hold on him, and on him

whereby we ſpeake vnto God, he is our eye whereby we ſée God, and he is our hand whereby we offer to God. Quo niſi intercedente, nec nobis nec omnibus Sanctis cum Deo quicquam est. Without whoſe interceſſion, neither we, nor any of the Saints haue any thing to do with God. Quem inuenirem qui me tibi reconciliaret? an eundum mihi ad Angelos? At qua prece? quibus Sacramentis? verus Mediator Chriſtus. Whō ſhould I find to recōcile mee to thee
                            (ſaith S. Anguſtine.) Muſt I go vnto Angels? But with what praier? with what Sacraments? The true Mediator is Chriſt. Quiſquis pro peccato compunctus eſurit &amp; ſit it iuſtitiam, credat in te qui iuſtificas impium, &amp; per ſolam fidem iuſtificatus pacem habebit apud Deum. Whoſoeuer feeleth compunction for ſinne, and hungreth and thirſteth after righteouſnes, let him beleeue in thee that doeſt iuſtifie the wicked, and by faith only he ſhall haue peace with God, ſaith S. Bernard. Non in fletibus &amp; actibus nostris, ſed in Aduocati noſtri allegatione confidimus. We doe not truſt in our weeping or working, but in the allegation or pleading of our Aduocate for vs, ſaith S. Gregorie. Thus ſpake the olde Fathers all, &amp; we muſt marke it. Popes pardons were pro fiſco, non pro Christo, for their own gaine, not for the good of Chriſtes people,
                            as One of their owne ſide ſaid well of them. &amp;c.

Hebr. 4. 15. 
                           In all things (ſaith the Apoſtle) he was tempted in like ſort, yet without ſinne.

of the Angels,
                            ſaith the Apoſtle, did God ſay at any time,

                           a flame of fire. Alſo to ſhew, as they are obedient and ſeruiceable at all appointments, ſo ſhould we be; remembring the incomprehenſible goodnes of our God, who among other his infinite fauours whereby he bindeth vs to his ſeruice, hath made euen this, one, That theſe holy Angels alſo are our ſeruants by his appointment. A mightie motiue to a good and thankfull minde to labour to become obedient and dutiful to ſuch a Father, to ſuch a Creator, to ſuch a God. Laſtly, to figure out, that when we draw néere to the Propitiatorie (a figure of Chriſt,) and are of God in his great mercie adopted in Chriſt for his ſonnes, we are called, and as it were ioyned to the companie and ſocietie of the Cherubims and holy Angels of God: A comfort alſo for vs that come vnto him.
                        4 The Cherubims ſtretch their wings on high, couering the Mercie Seate with their winges: ſo repreſenting 
                           Verſ. 20. the maieſtie of Chriſt, who though he ſhould humble himſelfe to a verie low eſtate for mans good, yet indéede was of that glorie and brightneſſe in his Godhead, as no fleſh could be able to behold, but muſt Math. 17. 2. See his transfiguration. Twelue legions of Angels could he haue had. &amp;c. hide their eyes, and acknowledge their infirmitie, if but a ſmall glimſe thereof ſhould be ſhewed them. Figuring alſo the moſt comfortable protection of the Lord Ieſus our Sauiour, who ſpreadeth as it were his wings ouer his Church, and euerie member of it, to repulſe any harme that might happen, other than he will graciouſly turne to his glorie, &amp; the Church or parties good, which then indéed is no harme, but a benefit rather, although bitter to the fleſh, &amp; diſgracefull in the world. Thus ſpread he his winges ouer Iacob, and ſaued him from Laban; ouer Ioſeph, &amp; ſaued him from his brethren; ouer Eliah, &amp; ſaued

him from Ieſabell; ouer Eliſha, 2. King. 6: and thus euer as the Hen to her chickens, ſo is the Lord our gracious God to all that truly feare him. A maruellous ſwéet Meditation, if you follow it.
                        5 The faces of theſe Cherubims were one towards another, and both of them toward the Mercie Seat: ſo repreſenting the conſent of the Old and New Teſtament, in both which there is but one truth and one doctrine; the Olde hauing
                            his face towards the New, and the New alſo Act. 26. 22. looking at the Olde. For what is the Olde Teſtament, but the newe (obſcure?) and what the new Teſtament, but the Olde made plaine? And both Olde and New looke vpon Chriſt, the promiſed ſeed of the woman that ſhould bruiſe the Serpents head. They being ſaued in the olde Teſtament, by beleeuing he ſhould come; and we being ſaued in the New, by beléeuing he is come.
                        6 And there (ſaith God) I will declare my ſelfe vnto 
                           Verſ. 22. 
                           thee, and from aboue the Mercie Seat betweene the two Cherubims which are vpon the Arke of the Teſtimonie, I will tell thee all things, which I will giue thee in commaundement vnto the children of Iſrael. Still note the excellencie of this figure of the Mercie Seat. For as God before had ſpoken out of the buſh, Exod. 3. 4. verſ. and out of the cloud, Numb.
                            12. 5. verſ: ſo hereafter, ſaith he, I will ſpeake to you from betwixt theſe Cherubims,
                            and ſo he did. For in the Booke of Numbers you reade thus; When Moſes went into the Tabernacle of the congregation, 
                           Numb. 7. 89. 
                           to ſpeake with God, he heard the voyce of one ſpeaking vnto him from the Mercie Seat, that was vpon the Arke of the Teſtimonie betweene the two Cherubims, and he ſpake to him. Whereupon the Prophet Eſay
                            ſaith, God 
                           Eſay. 37. 16. Pſal. 99. 1. 
                           dwelleth betweene the Cherubims.
                            And Dauid in his Pſalme alſo. The Lord is King, be the people neuer ſo impatient, he ſitteth between the Cherubims, be the earth neuer ſo vnquiet. And againe, Heare O thou Shepeheard 
                           Pſal. 80. 1. 
                           of Iſrael, thou that leadeſt Ioſeph like ſheepe:

ſhew thy ſelfe alſo, that ſitteſt vpon the Cherubims.
                            And fitly did this reſemble Chriſt by whom God afterward would ſpeak vnto his Church whatſoeuer he would commaund. As the Apoſtle writeth to the Hebrewes, when he ſaith: At ſundrie times, and in diuers manners God 
                           Hebr. 1. 1. 
                           ſpake in the olde time to our Fathers by the Prophets; but in theſe laſt daies he hath ſpoken to vs by his Sonne:
                            which ſtill hee continueth and will vnto the end of the world, though not by liuing voice and perſonall preſence in earth as he did for a time. How then? Still looke vpon the figure. Two Cherubims
                            were vpon the Mercie ſeat repreſenting
                            (as you haue heard) the Two Teſtaments, and from betweene thoſe two Cherubims God ſpake: ſo doth Chriſt ſtill by the Two Teſtaments, the olde and the new, the lawe and the Goſpell, the Prophets and Apoſtles; and ſo will he ſtill ſpeake to the end. Other waies wee muſt not now expect; Reuelations and dreames, viſions and miracles are ceaſed, and if they will not heare Moſes and the Prophets, neither wil they beleeue, if one ſhould riſe and come from the dead vnto them. In Moſes and the Prophets is the new Teſtament conteyned, though obſcurely, as you haue heard; and therefore ſtill to theſe Cherubims reſort, if you meane to heare your God ſpeake. Huge is the heape therfore of their ſinne, that barre Gods people from this way, and will make themſelues to be Cherubims onely to be heard and beléeued, ſhamefully affirming, That the people are not to ſearch the Scriptures, but to receiue all things from their Teachers vpon their bare credit, not reaſoning, not diſputing, not aſking any Queſtions more than the horſe aſketh his maiſter, why he turneth him this way, or that? but ſimply obeying. Thus neuer dealt God with people ſince he gaue them his Scriptures you well know; but as the other parts of their ſpirituall armour, Helmet, Breaſtplate, and Epheſ. 6. 17. ſo forth, ſo he bad them take their weapon, (without which what ſhould armour do?) euen their ſword, which,
                           
ſaith he, is the word of God. But truth ſéekes no darkeneſſe, and lies loue no light. Be you armed being warned, and go you to the Cherubims, where you ſhall heare God (that deceiueth not) ſpeake vnto you, knowing that as theſe people of the Iewes were tied to the Propitiatorie, ſo are we now to Chriſt in his word.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Table of the Shew bread.
                        1 THou ſhalt alſo make a table of Shittim wood of two 
                           Verſ. 23. 
                           cubits long, &amp;c. The building and parts you muſt read in your Bible. This Table againe was a third figure of Chriſt who is propounded of God to his Church as a table furniſhed with all dainties and contents. Nothing 1. Cor. 1. 30. wiſedome, righteouſnes. &amp;c. is wanting in him that we can want and is good for vs to haue, but aske and you ſhall haue, ſeeke and you ſhall finde. He is the riches of God to all that beléeue in him. The Shew bread vpon this Table repreſented
                            the word and the preaching of the ſame, whereby as by bread man is fed, ſtrengthened, and continued aliue. The one thus worketh to his bodie, the other effecteth it to his ſoule. A great bleſſing is the one, a farre greater is the other. And therefore labour not for the meat which periſheth ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt, but for the meate which
                            
                           Iohn. 6. 27. 
                           indureth to eternall life, &amp;c. It was called Shew bread becauſe it alwaies ſhewed it ſelfe before God. For it was not lawfull to remooue the olde before they brought and placed their new, and ſo it neuer wanted, verſ. 30. In Hebrew, the bread of faces,
                            becauſe it euer ſtood before the face of God, as a continuall remembrance of the twelue Tribes of Iſraell. The being of it continually, figured how preaching ought to be continuall.
                        
                        2 When as the Iſraelites did eate of the ſame wheate whereof the Shew bread was made (the ſame being of the firſt fruites of their corne offered) they were thereby admoniſhed by type and ſigure to eate and drinke euer

as if they ſate before God and were his gueſtes. And that the bread &amp; meate whereon they fed was in ſome ſort holy and conſecrate to God, to be vſed therefore ſoberly and reuerently. The like good meditation may we haue at this day, although we haue not the ſame Ceremonie. For whoſe are all the creatures we vſe for the refreſhing of our bodies, but the Lords? And ſhould we then abuſe them riotouſly, prophanely, waſtfully and wickedly, as many do? The fault is manifeſt, the truth and right is as manifeſt. Such as be Gods will note it, and amend it, if there be any fault, giuing thanks both before and after, for ſuch goodnes as we little deſerue, and vſe them well.
                        3 Thou ſhalt alſo make diſhes (to ſet the bread vpon) Verſ. 29. 
                           for it, and incenſe-cups, and couerings, and goblets, &amp;c. Deſeruedly was that Biſhop commended, which ſolde the holy veſſels in the time of famine to relieue the poore with the money, and excuſed himſelfe to the Church: That becauſe GOD neyther eateth nor drinketh, therefore hee needeth no diſhes nor cups. But to haue ſaid thus in the time of theſe Ceremonies, and by that pretext to haue robbed the houſe of GOD of thoſe things, had not beene well. For euerie thing hath his proper time. As then to take them away, being commaunded for Types and figures, had béene euill: ſo now to bring them in without commaundement, and to kéepe figures when the truth and bodie is come, is alſo vnlawfull. Which might yéeld a ſober minde due contentment againſt the idle and ſuperfluous furniture of Popiſh Churches, neither to deſire it when it is wanting, nor to like it whē it is preſent. Neither is the Church now in her infancie; nor true beléeuers in their minoritie; but ſhadows are gone, Chriſt is come, &amp; his true worſhippers worſhip him in ſpirit and truth. Moſes
                            and the Prophets are read Iohn. 4. 23. and preached, mens hearts are opened by the holy Ghoſt in the miniſterie of the word being powerfull and ſtrong.

Good life is ſought and ſinne is reprooued. Prayers are offered vp vnto God in a tongue vnderſtood, the Sacraments adminiſtred dulie according to their Inſtitution; &amp; this is a bleſſed beautie in a Church, though there be neither Gold nor Siluer ſhining vpon the walles. The truth and comfort of conſcience ſhining within vs is far more excellent &amp;c.

                           ALſo thou ſhalt make a Candleſtick of pure gold: of 
                           Ver. 31. 
                           work beatē out with the hammer ſhal the Candleſtick be made, his ſhaft and his branches, his bowles and his knops: and his flowers ſhalbe of the ſame. Six branches ſhall come out of the ſides of it, &amp;c. A fourth figure 
                           Ver. 32. of Chriſt is this Candleſticke, and of other good things alſo taught by it myſtically. As firſt, the whole Candleſtick beeing an inſtrument of light, noteth out fitly, that euen ſo, Chriſt is the light of his church, which light of his, in his holy Scriptures he propoſech continuallie to Men &amp; Women that will reade them. The Heathens &amp; Pagans had their Religion: but becauſe they had not this Candleſticke Chriſt,
                            therefore they had no light, but were vaine in their thoughts, and their fooliſh hart was ful of darkneſſe. They turned the glorie of the incorruptible God to the 
                           Rom. 1. 23. 
                           ſimilitude of the image of a corruptible man, and of birds, and foure footed beaſtes, and of creeping things. They turned the truth of God into a lye, and worſhipped 
                           25 
                           and ſerued the Creature, forſaking the Creator, &amp;c. The Faithfull haue this Candleſticke, and therefore their Religion is true, they haue light and know what they worſhip. 
                           Iohn. 4. 22. Their actions and manners alſo are directed aright: for they are made to ſée what truly pleaſeth, &amp; what truly diſpleaſeth, not following their owne imaginations and willes, dooing what ſéemeth good in their owne eyes, but what God hath commanded, that doo they.
                        2 The Candleſticke was in the Sanctuarie or Church,
                           
and the light of the Word whereby Chriſt ſhineth ſhould be in the Church, that all the congregation thither comming might ſée and receiue the comfort of it. This is the true beautie of a Church indéede, as hath bene ſaide, and therefore either their ignorance, or their malice was monſtrous, who ſet Candleſtickes of Gold, and Siluer, and Shining braſſe in their Churches, but could not abide the word vnleſſe it were in a ſtrang tongue; all light (but that light) was regarded, banners and pictures and ſilkes and ſmelles and all beautie but not the Scriptures. Therefore ſéeing they had not the true Candleſticke Chriſt in his Word giuing light, their glorie was vanitie and their light was groſſe and grieuous darkneſſe.
                        3 The Candleſticke, as you ſée in the picture of your Bible, had an vpright ſtemme and ſix branches iſſuing out, three on either ſide of the ſtemme. The ſtemme repreſēted Christ from whom all light groweth, euen as the ſix brā
                              ches come from the ſtemme. The branches are ſet in the ſtemme, and ſo are all that giue light ſet in Chriſt. The 
                           Greg. ho. 6. ſuper Ezech. Iohn. 15. 4. 
                           branche, ſaith our Sauiour, cannot beare fruite of it ſelfe, except it abide in the vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the vine; ye are the branches; he that abideth in me, &amp; I in him, the ſame bringeth foorth much fruite: for without me can ye doo nothing. Euen ſo ſay you of light. No man is an inſtrument of any light to others, but as he himſelfe is in the ſtemme Chriſt from whom commeth all light. In him men giue much light and ſhine vnto many both farre and néere by Word and writing, &amp;c.
                        
                        4 There are many branches of the Candleſtick. The branches are chieflie the Miniſters of the Church, and the varietie noteth their diuers degrees and orders. Theſe all grafted in the ſtemme, and growing out from the ſtemme, do alſo giue light in the Sanctuary. A great honor to themſelues when they do giue light, and a great comfort to the beholders that ſée their light. Thus to ſhine, is rightly and truly to ſhine in Gods houſe, and all glorie

els, pompe, and port, and ſtate, is vtter vanity if this be away. The light was euer in the Church, and ſo diligent ſhould Miniſters be that their ſound ſhould be heard ſtill, ſtill, as the Lord willeth, In ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, 
                           2. Tim. 4 2. holy day and worke day, if the place require it, and tenne thouſand times happy that ſeruant, whom when his maiſter 
                           Luke. 12. 38. 
                           commeth he ſhall finde ſo doing. I lay no burdens on any mans backe, but the Lord that called hath inioined the worke, accounted vs faithfull, and put vs in his ſeruice. He, he it is that hath deliuered out his money, 
                           Mat. 25. 14. and will looke for a reckoning, that lent vs his light and will one day aſke what wee did with it. He gaue it not to be put vnder a buſhell, but to be ſhewed out to all that are in the houſe. O that Hee may giue the feeling remembrance of it! Then will not loyterers condemne labourers, and thinke it vnfit to preach too often; curioſitie ſhalnot put out the candle a quarter of a yéere together, or cenſure diligence and plaineneſſe in others for want of it. Euery mans labour ſhalbe accepted for the end whereunto they are directed, and godly ioy in euery mans well doing. That ſnake of enuie will flye away, &amp; where diſcouragement hath growen, cōfort will ſpring, yt God may be pleaſed, and his Church profited by all mens meaſures and abilities. He that walketh in the midſt of the Candleſticks
                            ſéeth the light or darkneſſe of them, and wil remooue 
                           Apop. 2. 1. any one that amendeth not, being faultie.
                        5 This Candleſticke had bowles &amp; knops and flowers to adorne it and beautifie it withall. The bowles figuring againe the ſpirituall gifts wherewith God Almighty doth beautifie his Paſtors and Teachers which are as lights in his Church, as Wiſedome, Learning, Eloquēce, 
                           1 Cor. 12. 8. &amp;c. 
                           Tongues, and ſuch like, teaching alſo theſe Miniſters that as Bowles do containe and kéep water or wine: ſo ſhould they conteine and euer kéepe doctrine and exhortation, to coole and comfort the conſciences of men bringing (as the good Scribe) out of their ſtore, things new and old. The

knops and flowers ſeruing for delight, well repreſented what pleaſure and contētment Godly people ſhould take, in a godly Teacher placed by Gods gratious prouidence ouer them. They will not treade vpon them but ſmell to them, not caſt them at their heeles but ſet them in their boſomes, as trulie pleaſing flowers vnto them. Still gold is the matter, and pure gold, to ſhew out, by way of Ver. 36. 
                           ſhadow, the excellencie of Chriſt, and of his faithfulll Miniſters in him, and for him.
                        
                        6 There were againe ſeauen Lampes
                            and oile in them 
                              Ver. 37. Septimus num erus numerus plenitudinis. for this light. The number of Seuen noting ſufficiencie, as (indeede) the Lord neuer faileth his Church of what hée knoweth néedefull. Oyle commonly ſignifieth the Goſpell and Faith kindled in the hearts of men by the efficacie of the Miniſterie; and the lampe ſhadoweth out a good conſcience. Becauſe, as oyle cannot be kept in a broken lampe, but in a whole: ſo is true Faith euer preſerued in a good conſcience; &amp; hurt the conſcience, looſe faith, looſe the Holy Ghoſt, and looſe eternall life. This is prooued by the bleſſed Apoſtle, when he ſaith, Fight a good fight, hauing 
                           1. Tim. 1. 18. 19. 5. 
                           faith &amp; a good conſcience; And againe, The end of the commandement is loue out of a pure heart, and of a good conſcience &amp; of faith vnfeigned. Furthermore, as the only lampe, emptie and drie, could not light thoſe fooliſh Virgins to the Bridegroomes chamber: ſo neither can a good conſcience, as Philoſophers ſpake of it, that is, honeſt externall action, ſaue a man, without there be alſo the oyle of the knowledge of the Goſpell of Chriſt. Laſtly, as a Lampe of glaſſe is brittle and ſoon broken: ſo the conſcience is a very tender thing, and quickly may becrakt, if not cleane broken. A iuſt cauſe to make men chary what they doo.
                        7 Snuffers and ſnuffe-diſhes are appointed for theſe Ver. 38. 
                           lightes, wherein we may alſo profit and bee inſtructed. For firſt, in that GOD leaueth not the leaſt and baſeſt thing to their willes, but himſelfe appointeth and preand

preſcribeth all, we very truly learn how odious in his ſeruice mens meere inuentions be, and how he euer tyed men to his owne commandement, not ſuffering them to doo what ſéemed good in their own eyes, and to ſalue vp the matter with their good intents. Amongſt then many other things in the Word, euen this alſo ſhould haue his force in our hearts, to beat vs from will-worſhips, and to make vs carefull to learne how God will be ſerued, and ſo onely and euer to ſerue him. Secondly, this is a great comfort to Miniſters, and to all the faithfull of God, who are alſo here ſhadowed, namely, that although my gifts be not ſuch as to ſet me high in the Tabernacle; yet am I not therefore vtterly vnprofitable, or vnfit, or reiected of God. But if I may be among the meaneſt veſſels of the Sanctuarie and of the Church, If I may be but as the Snuffers, or Snuffe-diſhes, as a doore keeper, as a beſome, or an aſh-pan, wherof mentiō wil be made hereafter, euen this ſhall well pleaſe me, &amp; herein will I reioyce, thanking my God right humbly, that hath looked vpon me in that meaſure. Euery faithfull man or woman cannot be great, and haue great places in the Church, the body hath diuers members, and all good, and made by God: the Church hath diuers degrees of Beléeuers, and yet all Beléeuers and loued of God: ſo, if you be one in any place, bleſſed be God for it: Your ioy ſhall be eternall alſo, and incomprehenſible. Thirdly, for the vſe of theſe Snuffers, you know they ſerued to make the lampe &amp; light ſhine more bright: So ſhadowing out, that the doctrine of the Church muſt be pure, bright, and light, not mixed with darkneſſe and ſnuffes in it: and to this end, the Lord hath diſcipline in his Church and diſputations, ſo to cleere, when obſcuritie groweth, and to ſet things well that went awrie. Diſcipline is profitable when it is rightly exerciſed by men authoriſed, but if men not authoriſed, by means not allowed, will be ſnuffing of lights, (indéede) rather aiming to put them out, than to amend their light, from a good heart

to haue all well, although they ſo may profit the lights accidentallye, yet their owne fingers may be ſo burned or blacked, as they had better haue dealt more charitably. Diſputations alſo haue their excellent vſe, to cléere matters obſcure in the doctrine or light of the Church, but ſo, that they be rightlie ordered &amp; guided, not béeing a ſtrife of words, whereof commeth enuie and raylings, Neither froward diſputations of men of corrupt mindes and deſtitute 
                           1 Tim. 6. 4. 5. 
                           of truth, whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, and biddeth Timothie auoide them. Both
                            theſe good vſes and their contrary abuſes, we may draw from the matter of ye 
                           Snuffers which was pure gold, ſo to teach, that neither men exerciſing diſcipline to remooue darkneſſe and amend the light, ſhould be braſſe or iron, wood, or worſe, nor diſputations and explications diuers &amp; differing from the matter of the Candleſticke, but both of golde, the one brotherly affected and méekely minded, the other true, right, naturall, agréeing with the bodie of the Scripture, with the proportion of faith, and the conſent of the godly members of the Church in their times. Such Snuffers and ſnuffing wée ſhall euer praiſe God for, as heartelie intreate him, on the contrarie ſide, to remooue away malice &amp; rage from vexing his poore ſeruants, and fruitleſſe contentions &amp; corrupt gloſſes from hurting or hindering his holy doctrine, the true lampe that lighteth vnto him. Thus may this Chapter profit vs, if we reade it ouer, and yet abſtaine frō too bold wading into allegories of euery particular thing, as ſome haue done both in times of old &amp; ſince not without danger and deſerued blame. A meaſure is fit, and that nothing bee vrged againſt Faith. For, of the two Rules in theſe things to be obſerued, the firſt is, as S. Paul teacheth vs, That he which hath prophecie, prophecie according 
                           Rom. 12. 6. 
                           to the proportiō of faith, that is, ſo expound things, as nothing diſagree from the Articles of our faith which 
                              
                                 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                              . aliud pes, aliud numerus ſonat. is a ſhort Summe of all doctrine. This did not Origen obſerue, and therefore in all ſuccéeding ages he ſtill carieth a

blame. The ſecōd Rule is out of the old Prouerb, The ſafeſt way is the beſt way. The ſafeſt way is that, wherein the Prophets or Apoſtles haue gone before, who albeit they doo not euer at large fellow an allegorie, yet many times they point their fingers at ſome, giuing ſo ye diligent Reader occaſion to note more. So in Eſay the Storie of Gideō
                            
                           1 Cor. 5. 7. 2 Cor. 3. 13. &amp;c. Gal. 4. 22. &amp;c. Rom. 3. 25. is referred to Chriſt and his Church. And in S. Paul that of ye 
                           paſchal Lamb, of Moſes vayle, of Abrahams two wiues, the free-woman and the bond-woman, of the propitiatorie, &amp;c.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. 26.
                     
                        THE former Chapter hath ſhewed GOD his purpoſe to haue a Sanctuarie or Tabernacle made, and what offering to that end hee required: now will this Chapter goe forward with the deſcription of the ſame, &amp; in what order things were placed in it. To the deſcription belong the firſt thirtie verſes, and to the order 
                        Diuiſion of the Chapter. the other laſt ſeauen verſes. Touching the Tabernacle, theſe things you may marke, the firſt couering conſiſting of ten curtaines of fine twyned linnen, and blew ſilke and 
                        Ver. 1. &amp;c. 
                        purple, and ſcarlet with Cherubims of broidered worke wrought, as you ſée in the picture of your Bible, of which ſpeake the firſt ſir verſes. Then the 2. couering made of curtaines of Goates haire, and ſpoken of from the beginning Ver. 7. &amp;c. of the ſeuenth verſe vnto the fourtéenth, vpon which was put a couering of rammes skinnes coloured red, and 
                        Ver. 14. a third couering of Badgers skinnes aboue that againe, Tabernaculum a tabulatis. all to defend the weather and to kéepe the Tabernacle drie. Laſtly, a frame of boordes to ſupport all theſe couerings,
                        
and to make it a houſe for God and his people to méete in, from the fifteenth verſe to the thirtie. Concerning the order of things laide down in the laſt ſeuen verſes, you muſt note, that in this Tabernacle there were three diſtinct places or roomes. Firſt the outward Court (as they called it) wherein the people were, where ſtood the Brazen Altar and the Lauer, of which you reade in the next Chapter, which roome was as the bodies of our Churches. Secondly, a place within that, ſeuered from it, wherein the Prieſts onely were, in which roome ſtoode the Golden Altar of Incenſe, the Table of the Shew-bread and the Golden Candelſticke. This was called the Holy Place, and it was as our quires. Thirdly, there was a roome within that againe, ſeuered alſo by a vayle wherein did ſtand the ARKE couered with the Mercie ſeate or propitiatory, 
                        Hebr. 9. 4 and the golden Cenſer was there kept. Chap. 40. This was called the moſt holy place, into which the High Prieſt but once a yéere entered, and that with blood. This was reſembled in the Popiſh time (as I take it) by drawing a Curtaine croſſe ouer the quire and ſo parting the vpper end of the quire from the reſt, which, as I remember, was done by them in Lent. Thus was the matter and forme of that Tabernacle.
                     
                     2 To make allegoricall vſe of all theſe things one by one, ſhoulde be vnwarranted curioſitie, as I haue ſaide; 
                           Yet remember what Luther ſaith in Gen. 12. Nihil putandum exiguum, ſiquidemid. S. S. noluit literis mandare, quod non profit. what Hierome in Epheſ. 1. Singuli ſermones, ſyllabae, apices, puncta, in diuinis Scripturis plena ſunt ſenſibus. What Chryſoſt. 
                           
                              •
                           o. 18 in Gen. cap. 4. Reconditū habēt theſaurum: or as Origen, inſtar herbae peculiarē habent vim &amp; proprietatem. Only therefore, as either others haue taught vs, or as wel ſtandeth with Faith, let vs walke and profit our ſelues. And firſt obſerue what the Apoſtle to the Hebrewes doth, whoſe ſteps wee may ſafely follow, and by his example apply the Holieſt place of all to Chriſt. Read the 9. and 10. Chapters of that Epiſtle. Others, not contrarie to the Scriptures, haue noted by the Common Court or Tabernacle in general, the viſible Church of God, imbracing his Word, praying to him and heard of him, defended by him in all perills, and in the end made partaker of eternall life. To this end therefore they thinke of Dauids
                        
words in many Pſalmes, as when he ſaith, O how amiable 
                        Pſa. 84. 1. 2. 
                        are thy dwellings, thou Lord God of hoſts! My ſoule hath a deſire and longing to enter into the Courts of the Lord, &amp;c. Againe, One thing haue I deſired of the Lord, 
                        Pſal. 27. 4. 
                        which I will require, euen that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord all the dayes of my life, to behold the faire beautie of the Lord, and to viſit his Temple. For in the 
                        5. 
                        time of trouble he ſhall hide me in his Tabernacle, yea in the ſecret place of his dwelling ſhal he hide me, &amp; ſet me vp vpon a rocke of ſtone. Lord, who ſhall dwell in thy 
                        Pſal. 15. 1. 
                        Tabernacle? that is, who ſhal be a member of thy Church? Bleſſed is the man whom thou chooſeſt and receiueſt vnto 
                        Pſa. 65. 4. 
                        thee: he ſhall dwell in thy courts, and ſhall be ſatiſfied with the pleaſures of thine houſe, euen of thy Temple.
                         All which places, vnder the figure of this worldly Tabernacle, as the Apoſtle calleth it, note out the viſible Church of God, diſperſed now far and wide ouer the face of the earth, the comforts of it, and the bleſſings in it.
                     3 The ſumptuous dignitie of euery thing ſo pure, ſo cleane, and ſo excellent, noted figuratiuely the puritie of the Church cleanſed in Chriſt, and how carefull euery member of the ſame muſt be, to kéepe himſelfe pure and cleane, as the Lord ſhall ſtrengthen him. The goodly &amp; rich furniture and ornamentes ſhadowed out (as hath béene ſaide) the rich gifts and Graces of God powred vpon his Church, and the bleſſed eſtate of it vnder Chriſt. Of which ſée a deſcription in the Prophet Eſay moſt notable. O thou afflicted and toſſed with tempeſt, that haſt 
                        Eſay. 54. 11. 
                        no comfort, behold, I will lay thy ſtones with the Carbuncle, and laye thy foundations with Saphires. And I 
                        12. 
                        will make thy windowes with Emerandes, and thy gates ſhining ſtones, and all thy borders of pleaſant ſtones. And 
                        13. 
                        all thy children ſhalbe taught of the Lord &amp;c.
                     
                     4 The three diſtinct Rooms they haue applied to three kindes or meaſures of righteouſnes thus. There was an outward Court, and that may repreſent the firſt ſtep

                        to God, when a man vſeth the outward Ceremonies and actions cōmanded, as then of ſacrificing, waſhing, and ſo forth, now of cōming to church, hearing, &amp;c. Thoſe be good things, but yet a man is not gotten into the Church, only into ye 
                        outward Court he is gottē, &amp; there remaineth; For euill men may doo theſe outward matters. Then there was an inward place, called ye 
                        Holy place, &amp; a third within that againe, called ye 
                        Holyeſt of all. So they ſay there is a ſecond degree of righteouſneſſe, or a ſecond ſtep to God, when a man dooth theſe outward things hartely, truly, &amp; vnfeignedly, And a third ſtep, when by ſo dooing, his hart is opened, and he beléeueth in him that redéemed him, and for euer holdeth faſt by him. And now is he gotten into both, the Holy place, and the moſt holy of all. Into the Holy place, in poſſeſſion, that is, to be a true and ſound member of Chriſt his Church, and into the moſt holy of all, by hope and in expectation, becauſe after this life is ended, he paſſeth into the preſence of God in heauen, and there liueth for euer.

                        Chriſt, as the Apoſtle to the Heb. expoundeth it: and ſecondly, that the Altars vſed in Popery are not warranted by this example. But that the Primatiue Church vſed Communiō tables (as we now doo) of boords and wood, not Altars (as they doo) of ſtone. Origen was about 2. hundred yéeres after Chriſt, &amp; he ſaith, that Celſus obiected it as a fault to the Chriſtians,

                        that they had neither Images, nor Churches, nor Altars. Arnobius
                         (after him) ſaith the ſame of the Heathens. Accuſatis nos quod nec Templa habeamus, nec aras, nec imagines: You accuſe vs, for that we haue neither Churches, nor Altars, nor Images. Gerſhon ſaith, that Silueſter firſt cauſed ſtone

                        Altars muſt be of ſtone, quia Petra erat Chriſtus, becauſe the Rock was Chriſt,
                         as Durandus after deuiſed. Upō this occaſion in ſome places ſtone Altars were vſed for ſteddineſſe &amp; continuance, wooden tables hauing béene before vſed, but I ſay in ſome places, not in all. For S.

                     2 Touching the hornes of the Altar ſpoken of, they litterally ſerued to kéepe vp the ſacrifice from falling of, and figuratiuely noted ſtrength: ſo that, to binde the ſacrifice to the hornes of the Altar,
                         was to giue themſelues wholly 2. Sam. 22. 3. with a ſtrong faith, and onely to reſt and truſt and ſtay vppon him, &amp; to tye al carnall affections faſt alſo to the Altars hornes, by ſubduing and making them captiue to God. This Altar was in one place, &amp; the Sacrifice in one place, noting how Chriſt ſhould onely once, and in one place offer vp himſelfe for al mankinde.
                     3 Concerning the lampes, as little doo they warrant Popiſh tapers and candles, as the Altars before, did their Altars. And Chriſtians vſed no ſuch follies and apiſh imitations of things abrogated and ſeruing only for the time. For

                     CHAP. 28.
                     1 AFter God hath ſpoken of the Tabernacle, and the ſeuerall things to be placed and ſet in the ſame; now he commeth to the perſons that ſhoulde gouerne, and, as it were, be the maſters in the ſame, namely the Prieſts. And firſt hee calleth &amp; chooſeth the men which he will haue, then he adorneth them with fit and decent apparrell for ſo high a calling. Concerning the first, Cauſe thou,
                         ſaith God to Moſes, thy brother Aaron to come vnto thee, and his ſonnes with him, from among the children 
                        Ver. 1. Moſes hauing not the like dignitie, neither annointed, nor apparelled &amp;c. yet is bidden to cal them. Ergo Sacraments depend not vpon men, but vpon the commandements of God. See Caluin. No man ought to take this honour except called as Aaron was. Heb. 5. 
                        of Iſrael, that he may ſerue me in the Prieſts office, I meane Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar Aarons Sonnes. No reaſons God here alleageth, why he woulde haue theſe to bee his Prieſtes rather than any others, but ſimply commandeth to chooſe them, thereby

plainly teaching vs, that out of his own will and pleaſure, he euer maketh choiſe of his Miniſters, not regarding any dignitie or excellencie in man, but only mooued with his owne mercie and fauour firſt to chooſe him, and ſeparate him euen from the wombe to ſuch ſeruice, and after (in time, by degrées, &amp; as he will,) to fit him and frame him to performe it. The inward calling hereunto, euery man rightly entring into the Miniſterie féeleth in his hart and conſcience within, which maketh him a true Miniſter to God and his conſcience. The outwarde is not now by voice, as here it was, and after in the new Teſtament, but by the approbatiō of ſuch, as in ye 
                        Church where we liue, haue authoritie cōmitted to them ſo to approoue, which maketh him a Miniſter be fore men, not to be refuſed vpō euery priuate mans fancie, before authoritie haue heard the reaſons, and allowed them well: knowing, that his inſufficiencie or fault maketh not the ordinances of God voyde to them that rightlie vſe them, but that ſo to thinke, is altogether Anabaptiſticall. I referre the willing Reade Beza Queſt. 14 1. Reader to my Treatiſe vpon the Lords prayer (the laſt Petition) for more in this matter, in the temptation that ariſeth vpon conceiued wants in Miniſters.
                     
                     2 In this choiſe againe of his Prieſts, you may note the words, from among the children of Iſrael,
                         which are all one as if he had ſaide, men as you are, and of your acquaintance, not my ſelfe, or my Angels, who might feare you with Maieſtie and excellencie: and ſurelie this both then was, and ſtill is a great fauour. For you remember before, how when God ſhewed himſelf in ye mount by thoſe fearefull ſignes, the people cryed to Moſes, Talke thou 
                        cap. 20. 19. 
                        with vs, and we will heare: but let not God talke with vs, leſt we dye; ſo vnable is man to indure the voice of God. How Angels alſo haue feared men, ye 
                        Scripture is ful of teſtimonies. Wherefore, in great mercie was Moſes thē,
                         &amp; ſtill are the Miniſters now, vſed as meanes betwixt God &amp; his people, to ſpeake from him to them, without any terrifiyng

feare, a thing to make vs more careful to heare thē, &amp; to vſe them wel, thankfully acknowledging both yt 
                        bleſſing to our weakeneſſe, and the honor done vnto our nature, when our owne fleſh is in the ſtead of God vnto vs, &amp;c.
                     3 When God had made thus choiſe of the perſons, he pleaſeth to preſcribe them a kind of apparell differing frō others, &amp; teaching them and that people (figuratiuelie) many things, wherof ſtil vnto the end of the world there may be vſe for profitable inſtruction. Alſo thou ſhalt make (ſaith Ver 2. the Text) holy garments for Aaron thy brother, glorious and beautifull:

                         of whom Aaron was a figure; &amp; ſo to teach, wt what excellent vertues the Prieſtes of God, as with garments, ought to be adorned and beautified. The ſhadowes of the lawe I confeſſe are gone, and Miniſters of the word are not now figures of an other Chriſt to come, yet ſtill is it both lawfull and commendable that they ſhould be diſtinguiſhed from other men by a decent and fit at tyre, &amp;c.
                     4 But who ſhal make theſe glorious garmēts for Aaron 
                        Ver. 3. ye Prieſt? The Text anſwereth: Thou ſhalt ſpeak to all cū

                         By which words two things are taught vs. Firſt, yt in the ſeruice of God, nothing ought to be done, but what procéedeth from the directiō
                         of God his Wiſdome &amp; Will, that being the Rule and only Rule of his owne worſhip. Mens inuentions, without warrant from him, haue no place, be they neuer ſo gloriouſly coloured &amp; painted wt

Many men (otherwiſe good men) do cōdemn Gold ſmithes, Iewellers, perfumemakers, Imbroiderers, Arace-weauers, &amp; ſuch like, as though they ſerued onely for vanitie &amp; exceſſe, when indéede they be the workes of God (I meane their ſeuerall skils) and fruits of his Spirit, as héere we ſée. If any man abuſe them, it is the fault of man, not of the skill; and what may not be abuſed? The verie Heathens haue acknowledged theſe things Inuenta Deorum, the Inuentions of God.

                         of this ſort that is here deſcribed, rich &amp; precious, vſed only of the Iudg. 8. 27. 
                        High-prieſt, and an other of plaine linnen which was common to others; whereupon it was ſaid, that Saule cauſed foure-ſcore and fiue perſons, that did weare a linnen Ephod,
                         to be ſlaine, that is, ſo many Prieſtes. Little Samuel alſo, being a childe, is ſaid to miniſter before the

                        Lord, girded with a linnen Ephod. And his mother made him a little coat (that is, ſay ſome, a little Ephod) and 
                        19. 
                        brought it to him from yeare to yeare, when ſhe came vp with her huſband to offer the yearely ſacrifice. Dauid,

Touching the firſt kinde of Ephod you ſée here it is ſaid, that in two Onix ſtones the Names of the children of Iſraell

                        were to be grauen. Six Names of them in one ſtone and ſixe in the other. And theſe ſtones to be put vpon the ſhoulders of this Ephod, that Aaron might beare their Names before the Lord, &amp;c. Whereupon Beda thus noteth, lib. 3. de Tabernac. cap. 4. Tres ob cauſas Aaron nomina Patriarcharum in humeris portaſſe ſicut in pectore. Primò, vt ipſe fidem vitamque Patriarcharum meminiſſet imitari. Secundò, vt 12. tribuum quae de his natae ſunt, in orationibus &amp; ſacrificijs memor exiſteret. Tertiò, vt idem Pop. ſcripta in veſte Praeſulis ſui patrum nomina videns, curaret ſedulo ne ab illorum meritis deſciſcens, ad errorum contagia declinaret. For three cauſes Aaron did beare the names of the Patriarches vpon his ſhoulders as vpon his breaſt. Firſt, that he might remember to imitate the faith and life of the Patriarkes. Secondly, that he might remember both in his prayers and ſacrifices the twelue Tribes whereof the Patriarches ſprang. Thirdly, that the people ſeeing the Names of their Fathers written in the garment of their high Prieſt, might diligently take heed that they fell not from the vertue which was in them, vnto vice and error.

                         The ſecond is the Breaſtplate, frō the fifteenth verſe to the thirtie one. In which breſtplate was Vrim &amp; Thummim, Vnde certior factus eſt Sacerdos de Dei erga ſe &amp; populū voluntate, quoties de iure conſulentibus reſponſa erant danda. Num. 27. verſ. 21.

How this was done, ſeuerall men are of ſeuerall mindes. Ioſephus ſaith, Tantus erat ſplendor in 12. lapidibus quos ſuprapectus Pontifex portabat, vt omni fieret multitudini

                           is adeſſe Deum. li. 13. Antiq. cap. 12. The twelue ſtones which the Prieſt did beare vpon his breaſt did ſo ſhine and gliſter, that the whole multitude might obſerue Gods fauour to them, Suidas in the word Ephod (if I forget not, hauing not the booke now with me) maketh mention of an Adamant in the Ephod, which the prieſt putting on when he ſought counſell of God, and putting his hands vnder it, Cum detraheret, deprehēdebat eas quaſi colore quodā infectas, When he drewe them out, he did finde them as it were ſtayned and coloured with a certaine colour. Et ſi Deus petitioni annuebat, confeſtim micabat lapis Adamas; ſin negabat, nihil ad proprium &amp; priſtinum lapidis fulgorē accedebat: quod ſi Deus voluit pop. obijcere gladio, lapis reddebatur cruentus; ſi autem imminebat mors, lapis fiebat niger. And if God would graunt the petition, preſently the Adamant ſtone would gliſter extraordinarily, but if God denied it, then the Adamant remained ſtill without any change in his colour and ſhining: if God would deliuer the people to the ſword, then the ſtone was made bloodie; and in caſe of death, it would ſhew blacke.
                         The like things Epiphanius hath, ſpeaking of the Adamant which the High-prieſt did beare and weare. Auguſt. was of an other minde, and beléeued not thoſe things. Queſt. 117. in Exod. And ſo you ſée in a matter obſcure, mens gueſſes. Diuers others Virtus eſt Theologica rerum arcanarum ignorantia. What wants in vs, is to be ſought for in Chriſt our true High-Prieſt and his interceſsion for vs. See Hierom. ad Fabiolam Epiſt. 127. &amp; Epiſt. 130. ad Marcellū
                           
                         I might repeat, but let it be a vertue ſometimes to profeſſe ignorance. The third is the Robe, from the 31. verſe to the 36. The fourth is the golden plate vpon his forhead or miter, whereon was grauen HOLINES TO THE LORD, from ye 36. verſ. to the 39. The fift is the broidred coate, verſe.
                         39. And the ſixt, the girdle, in the ſame verſe. Of euerie parcell to ſtand and ſearch out particular ſignifications, ſhould be more curious than profitable. Diuers haue done ſo, but with little contentment to their Reader, becauſe their aſſertions are but gueſſes and verie vncertaine. The Names grauen
                         in the Onix ſtones

might teach both the Prieſt to remember the people, and the people to reſt in the iudgement of the prieſt. The bearing

For, it ſerued greatly to the honouring and gracing of this high Function in the eyes of the people, who are much mooued wt 
                        outward Ceremonies. It ſerued (beeing no idle ſhew) for the procuring of Gods bleſſing vpon them. For the Lord gratiouſly wrought in their hearts by his holy Spirit, what was outwardly ſhadowed by Ceremonie. The anoynting oyle outwardly

In the beléefe whereof, let vs euer reuerence and defend the miniſterie, vſe the bleſſing of it with true thankfulneſſe to the Author, and beſéech him heartely, that in his tender mercie to his poore lambes, he would continually ſend faithfull labourers into his harueſt. In this faith againe let vs cheere vp our hearts, when we ſée the Church ſhaken with rage of worldly troubles, ſo that many fall away in weakneſſe. For if the Lord will euer haue a miniſterie greater or leſſe: ſurely he will alſo euer haue a flocke for thoſe true Paſtors to imploy their gifts vpon, greater or leſſe. Thinke of the Speech in Amos often. Behold the eyes of the Lord God are vpon the ſinfull kingdome,

                         And let faithfull Miniſters of God lay vp in their hearts that example of Alexander the Great, to Iaddus the High-prieſt and his companie at Ieruſalem, with other ſuch like teſtimonies of Gods power, when he pleaſeth to vſe it. This Great conquerour of the world Alexander hauing beſieged ſeuen monethes the ſtrong Citie of Tyrus, ſent to his néere neighbours the lewes, for ſome men and helpe to beſent vnto him but they by pretenſe of gratitude to the kings of Perſia, who had euer béene kinde

(they ſaid) to them, denied him any ayde. Whereupon entering into a great rage againſt them, aſſoone as hee had gotten the Citie, be gathered all his forces to goe againſt Hieruſalem to be auenged of them, which when Iaddus the High prieſt vnderſtood, he put on all his Prieſtly attire, and tooke the reſt of his company alſo with him, and went to méete Alexander in the way, deſiring peace at his hands. Whom when Alexander ſaw (now ſée the finger of God with his Miniſter) he preſently alighted downe from his horſe, and falling vpon his knées to the High-prieſt, granted him and all the Iewes their deſired peace. A moſt admitable ſight in ſuch a warriour, ſuch an Emperour, ſuch a powerfull Prince as made all the world to ſtoope, himſelfe ſo to humble his bodie to an vnarmed Prieſt, vnknowne to him, and neuer ſéene before. His chiefe Counſellours Parmenio, Clitus, and others, were amazed at it, and aſking a reaſon, Alexander tolde them, God had ſhewed him in a dreame the verie ſame man ſo attired, and ſo accompanied, and promiſed him victorie; which now remembring, and hauing preuailed againſt Tyrus, in reuerence of that viſion, and hope of further ſucceſſe according to the promiſe, he held it moſt fit to behaue himſelfe in ſuch ſort. So was the caſe altered by an Omnipotent God, ſtriking euen that Lyon with a reuerence of his Miniſter, and after great gifts giuen to the Colledge, he departed peaceably into Aegypt. Not an vnlike reuerence did God ſtrike into the heart of Herode of Iohn Baptiſt, the Text ſaying, Herod feared Iohn, knowing that he was a iuſt man &amp; a holy, and reuerenced him, and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.
                         Surely, the Lord is the ſame both in power and mercie, if we will be true Paſtors and Miniſters to him and his people. Well may the mountaines be moued, and the leſſer hilles tremble, but his mercie ſhall neuer depart from his Miniſters, nor the Couenant of his peace be altered. Onely, onely let vs looke to our part of

the Couenant and performe it, not loytering, but labouring, and that in ſuch ſort, as maketh moſt for the edifying of our flocke. Let not them gape vpon vs, and catch nothing, our words paſſing like a ſtreame for our praiſe, not for their profit. &amp;c.

                         But Aiax like a mad Athieſt anſwered, Timidis &amp; ignauis opus eſſe auxilio Diuino, That feareful and cowardly men had need of Gods help, he would attaine to victorie without God.

Of Timotheus the other Athieſt thus we read: That when certayne enuious perſons ſpiting his ſucceſſe, made and ſpread abroade certayne pictures or fables, wherein they portrayed Fortune, hanging nets about ſuch Cities as he had ſubdued, he ſléeping faſt and dooing nothing, whereby they maliciouſly ſought to rob him of his due prayſe, and to giue it to Fortune, hee vnadviſedly, out of a proud and prophane heart, brake out into theſe wordes: Ego feci, non Fortuua, Theſe thinges, I tell you, my ſelfe haue done, not Fortune. After which wordes hee neuer had ſucceſſe in any ſeruice more. Underſtand by Fortune, GOD,
                         as the 
                           Fortuna eſt, cum Deus operatur occulte. better Heathens did, and the wickednes will appeare better of this Speach. Let vs then learne to burne the fat vnto God, that is, euer and euer to acknowledge, that all our proſperitie and ſucceſſe, all our comfort and good is from him, and him onely, without whom we can do nothing.

                        fleſh and bloud cannot inherit the kingdome of God. Others apply it to Chriſt, as a figure of him, and aleadge the Apoſtles words to the Hebrewes, where he ſaith, The bodies of thoſe beaſtes whoſe bloud is brought into

                        the people with his owne bloud, ſuffered without the gate. As if he ſhould haue ſaid, the carrying out of theſe things out of the hoſt, and burning of them there, was a notable figure how Chriſt ſhould ſuffer (being an offering for ſinne) without the gate, not in the Citie. The vſe whereof followeth in the ſame place, Let vs therefore goe foorth to him out of the campe, bearing his reproach. Sée your Marginall Note in your Bible vpon the words.

By the eare is noted obedience; whereupon the ſeruant that would ſtil continue with his maſter, was put to the poſt of his maiſters houſe, and bored in the eare, in token of perpetuall ſeruice and obedience: So by this figure the Lord would ſhadow out yt the Prieſtes (from whom others ſhould draw example) ſhould themſelues be obedient to his word in all things, and firſt heare, and then teach: Obedience was euer acceptable and pleaſing to God.

The right eare is choſen, to ſhadowe a right hearing of the word for amendement of life, and not a left for confirmation of errour and further obſtinacie againſt the Lord, as many do heare it. The Thumbe of the hand is touched with bloud, to teach that we muſt not onely be hearers, but dooers of the word, ioyning workes to faith, and holy life to a ſound beleefe. For the kingdome of God ſtandeth not in word, but in

                        power. The right Thumbe not the left, to ſhadow out, that we may not deceiue our ſelues in our workes, and doe what ſéemeth good in our owne eyes, thinking to pleaſe GOD with our good and fayre intents, but our workes muſt be right, commaunded by God, not inuented by vs. For want of which due conſideration, O, how many are deceiued, and wearie themſelues in dooing what God neuer will accept or reward? Wo be to the Teachers, that for their owne aduantage haue thus abuſed Gods poore people the worke of his hands, the price of his déere Sonnes bloud. The Thumbe is touched, but it is the right Thumbe, and both by figure and plaine teſtimonies, the Scriptures are manifeſt in this point. To the like end, was the great Toe of their right foote alſo ſprinkled with bloud, that they might ſo remember to walke worthie of their vocation. And vſually, by the foot, in Scripture, is both action and affection noted. Their feete are ſwift to ſhed bloud, that is, their actions are cruell and tyrannicall. My feete had almoſt ſlipped, ſaith Dauid, meaning both action and affection. Looke to thy foote when thou entereſt into the houſe of God, that is, to thy minde, intent and affection. Laſtly, both Aaron and his garments, and his ſonnes, and their garments were ſprinkled with bloud:
                         To teach, that he and Ver. 21. all his ſeruice and interceſſion for the people, was onely in his bloud acceptable, who ſhould ſhed his bloud for mankinde, the true Aaron and High prieſt, Christ Ieſus.
                        
                     
                     6 The breſt &amp; the ſhoulder were the Prieſts part,
                         as you Ver. 26 &amp; 27. ſée, alotted by God to them for their maintenance, yet not without ſome figuratiue reſemblance: for the breſt is often vſed to ſignifie wiſdom, &amp; the ſhoulders to note ſtrength in bearing. So by theſe parts giuen to ye 
                        Prieſts, God would ſhadow how ye 
                        prieſts ought euer, both in wiſdom &amp; iudgement, &amp; in bearing &amp; induring ye many difficulties of their own function, &amp; all other croſſes whatſoeuer, go before the

people, and be examples to them of comfort and courage, of counſell and good aduiſe in all things. Great vſes are then of Miniſters, if people had eyes to ſee them, and harts wiſely to conſider them, that with thankfulnes both to God and his inſtruments, they might righly vſe Gods goodnes prouided for them.

The ſame garments continued, although the Prieſt by mortalitie (being a naturall man) changed: and ſo was ſignified, that our High prieſt (not meere man, but God and man) is one, and his righteouſneſſe (our bleſſed garment) remayneth to Father, Sonne, and ſonnes ſonne, to the worlds end, in them that feare him, and by a true faith beléeue in him. Againe (by the way) we may note that by Gods lawe the high prieſt was not buried in his Robes &amp; Pontificalibus, as now (forſooth) Biſhops be among apiſh imitators of theſe Iewes Ceremonies,
                         a toy taken vp without reaſon, vnleſſe this may be reaſon, becauſe being dead they meane to diſcharge that dutie of their place, which aliue they neuer made any conſcience of.

When any Sacrifice was effected in this ſort, the bringer or owner, and the Prieſtes did eate part, and ſo were as Gods gueſtes inuited of him to a holy feaſt; which that it might be with more reuerence and ſpiritual preſence, all things were done in the Holy place, the meat ſoden and eaten, &amp;c: ſo a difference made betwixt that and their ordinarie diet at other times, their mindes drawen to the meditation of ſuch myſteries, and they preſent rather at a Sacrament than an earthly repaſt. No prophane perſon was admitted, but onely ſuch as were of the family of God, and yet in our daies they that will ſéeme moſt religious teach and ſtriue to maintaine, that wicked and prophane perſons may aſwell eate the bodie, &amp; drinke the bloud of Chriſt, as the godly may; and to that end teach a groſſe reall preſence of materiall fleſh and blood by tranſubſtantiation. Nothing will draw them from this madneſſe, neyther the figures of the lawe nor the plainneſſe of the Goſpell, but headlong to hell they will runne with it againſt Scripture, Fathers, Reaſon, and whatſoeuer ought to perſwade wiſe men. The late beginning of this curſed error they read and ſée as well as we, Tertullians Rule they acknowledge with vs, That trueth is firſt, and that which was firſt, is truth; and yet they fayle and ſtill will fayle to graunt and make the concluſion. Their handes are red in their poore brethrens bloud, who haue auowed trueth and choſen rather to looſe life than to forſake trueth: what remaines but ſearefull confuſion, without repentance? God giue them eyes.
                     10 Now, if ought of the fleſh of the conſecration, or of the bread remayne vnto the morning, then thou

                        ſhalt burne the reſt with fire. It ſhall not be eaten becauſe it is an holy thing. First,
                         this was done for more reuerence of thoſe holy Sacrifices, leſt by reſeruation, eyther any loathing might haue growen from wormes and ſuch like, or neglect and contempt, by

caſting it away or looſing it. Secondly, by this ſhadowed, that God will haue no part of his worſhip put ouer till an other day, but cheerefully euer will hee be ſerued without delayes. Cras, Cras, To morow, to morow, is the noice of a Crow, not the voyce of a Chriſtian. But To day if you will heare his voyce, hearden not your

                        hearts; And, while it is called To day, exhort one another, with many other ſuch Speaches in the Scripture are we ſtirred vp to take preſent time, and not to delay. Thirdly, by this denying them to keepe any, the Lord would preuent ſuperſtition by abuſing thoſe parts kept contrarie to Gods will: as, to heale diſeaſes, to keepe away ill Spirits, to hang them about their necke, to ſweare by them, and ſuch like, as at this day is to be ſeene in the Popiſh Church by reſeruation of the Sacrament. Sathan
                         was readie then, had not this lawe preuented him; but after, in the time of the Goſpell, hee preuailed, and euen in Tertulians time were crept in foule abuſes growing to adoration of the bread.
                     
                     11 Theſe things thus paſſed ouer belonging to the conſecration of the Prieſtes, your Chapter commeth to Verſ. 39. 
                        the Sacrifice which was continuall. A Lambe in the Morning, and a Lambe at Euen, with what further is ſpecified in the Text. By which kinde of Sacrifice notably the Lambe Chriſt Ieſus was figured, which taketh away ſinnes of the world.
                         The manner how the Lambe reſembled Chriſt, you may read in the 12. Chapter of this Booke, where Speach was of the Paſchall Lambe, &amp; thither I referre you. Oyle and Wine were added to this Verſ. 40. ſacrifice, to ſignifie, that vnto theſe holy exerciſes of the lawe, they ſhould bring with them faith and repentance which ſhould make the taſt of them good, as oyle and wine doth the Sacrifice. For without theſe two, what ſauour or reliſh could God haue of them? Sorrow for my ſinne, and faith in him that hath redeemed mee from my ſinne, is all the camfort God can conceiue

in me; and therefore beware of dooing any dutie to him without theſe two, leſt the Lord ſay, I haue no pleaſure in them. Oyle
                         and wine then with that Legall Sacrifice,
                         and faith and repentance with our ſpirituall duties and Sacrifices, agrée well.
                     As all Sacrifices then
                         led vnto Chriſt, ſo did this daily Sacrifice of the two Lambes Morning
                         and Euening, moſt plainely; and therefore after Chriſt was exhibited in the fleſh, accordingly theſe legall Sacrifices had their end all, and by name this, whereof read the praediction of Daniel in his ninth Chapter. Yet neuertheleſſe the Synagogue of Antichriſt is not aſhamed hereupon to build that filthie Idol of their Maſſe, ſaying, that all they are Antichriſtes which take away their daily Sacrifice of their Maſſe. But their mouthes are no ſlaunder. The trueth we holde, and GOD euer make vs holde it, both in this point, and the reſt. In this point we ſay thus, that this daily ſactifice of the Lambes, figured Chriſt; he is come, and therefore no longer to be figured as to come. But theſe Lambes are gone, and he the true Lambe remayneth, once offered vpon the croſſe, but daily ſauing vs from our ſinnes, vpon our true repentance and faith in him. He is our daily ſacrifice and continuall Mediator. And who ſo taketh him away, hee is Antichriſt, ware he thrice three Crownes vpon his head: But that doth the Man of Rome and his Succeſſion, who teach that remiſſion of ſinnes may bee obteyned by other meanes than by him onely. Wee haue none but him, yeſterday, and to day, and the ſame for euer. His bleſſed Sacrament he hath left vs, to remember vs of his worke wrought for vs, and wee ſo vſe it to thankeſgiuing, and not as a ſacrifice for quicke and deade, as they doe. Judge betwixt vs, good Chriſtian Reader, and the Lord giue thee wiſedome in all thinges.
                     13 Finally, the Lord promiſeth, they vſing theſe

his appointments rightly, he will dwell among them, and 
                        Ver. 45. 
                        will be their God. It is not hard in proſperitie to thinke God is preſent and careth for vs, béeing indéed, as Philoſophers could ſay, the Cauſe of all good things in Nature. 
                        Deus eſt mens aterna, cauſa boni in Natura. Plato.
                         But when the cloudie day of aduerſitie commeth, and wée are ouerwhelmed (as it were) with perilles and croſſes, then is it a gratious ſtrength to thinke and beléeue ſo ſtedfaſtly. Cato a Wiſe-man, as long as Pompei ſtood and flouriſhed, defended ſtoutlye a Prouidence, but when he fled into Egipt, &amp; was ſlaine of a baſe fellow, &amp; lay vpon the ſhore without any honor of buriall, when Cato himſelf alſo was beſet wt 
                        Caeſars army, then in this miſt of miſerie, he fell from his former doctrine, turning his tale as if there were no Prouidence at all, but euery thing went by Hap, and ſaying, There was a great darkneſſe in Diuine things, ſeeing Pompei, who had many times proſpered and had good ſucceſſe in ill cauſes, now was ouerthrowen in a good cauſe moſt miſearably, namely, in the defence of his countrey. Too many taſte of this weakeneſſe, which know more than Cato knew; and therefore in the day of comfort and faire Sunneſhine, it is good to gather ſtrength againſt a change; And to remember ſuch Spéeches as this of God to his Church, and to his people. I WILL DVVELL AMONG YOV, AND WILL BE YOVR GOD. Hee is true in this promiſe aſwell in foule weather as in faire, and we muſt be aſſured of it. Other like Spéeches there are many. If any man loue me (ſaith Chriſt) He will keepe my word, and my Father will loue him, and wee will come to him, and dwell with him.
                         The Pſalmes are full of ſuch comforts. The Lord is neere vnto all them that are of atroubled ſpirit, the LORD is neere to all them that call vpon him faithfully. It is a memorable place, where Eſay the Prophet
                         bringeth-in GOD ſaying, Ego DEVS habito cum contrito et humili SPIRITV, vt erigam SPIRITVM humilium, et viuificem CORDA contritorum,

I the Lord will dwell with the contrite and humble ſpirit, that I may raiſe vp the ſpirit of the humble, and reuiue the hearts of them that are contrite. It is the manner of ſinfull men to inſult ouer them that are in affliction, and to go ouer where the wall is broken, but with our ſwéete &amp; gratious God it is far otherwiſe, of whom the Prophet Hoſea ſpeaketh thus, Quomodo affligam te, Iſrael? aut quomodo puniam te, O Ephraim? Iuſté quidem te delerem, ſed conuerſum eſt in me cor meum. Exarſit comiſeratio mea, non faciam furorem irae meae, quia Deus ego ſum, et non Homo, &amp;c. How ſhould I afflict thee, O Iſrael? Or how ſhould I puniſh thee, O Ephraim? Iuſtly might I deſtroy thee, but my heart is turned within me, &amp; my mercie burneth towards thee, I will not execute the furie of my wrath, becauſe I am God &amp; not mā, &amp;c.
                         Thus, thus let vs gather comfort, and in all ſtormes look vnto him, and hold faſt by him: he is the ſame and no Changling, good, before, good now, and good euer: Chaſtiſe vs he may for our good, but forſake vs to our harme he will neuer. Fyre tryeth gold, &amp; affliction the godlie. Abraham euen paſt hope, yet beleeued vnder hope,
                         and ſo doo you. If the Lord ſhould kill me, 
                        Rom. 4. 18. ſaith Iob, yet will I put my truſt in him. Aske ſince the world was made, who euer claue faſt vnto him, and was

God for his Sons ſake ſtrengthen our harts in al our waies, and giue vs aſſurance immoueable, that he dwelleth with vs according to this promiſe.

                     1. THe Holy-Ghoſt hauing thus paſſed ouer the ordinarie Sacraments of the lawe in the 25. and 26 Chapters, the obſeruations belonging thereunto in the 27. and 28. the Sacrifices in this laſt 29. Chapter: Now, in this 30. he layeth down ſuch things as belonged to the Miniſtring of all the former; And by name noteth 5. ſorts of holy inſtruments. whereof the firſt belongeth to Gods ſeruice, the ſecond to the whole Miniſterie, to wit, the money for the maintenance of the Sanctuarie: the third is the Lauer; the fourth is the holye Oyle; the fift is the Incenſe &amp; the manner to make it. Touching the Altar of Incenſe, if you marke the Text, you ſhall ſée in the firſt verſe the matter of it, Sittim wood: in the ſecond

                        Ver. 9. 
                        no ſtrange incenſe might be offered vpon it: And laſtly, in the tenth verſe, a peculiar reconciliation by ſacrifice to Ver. 10. be made vpon the hornes of this Altar, once in a yeere by blood.
                     
                     2. Concerning the myſterie and meaning of all theſe, thus you may ſafely meditate of them. The Altar of incenſe was of Wood and couered with gold, figuring ſo, Chriſt in both his Natures, the Wood his humanitie, the

                        gold his Diuinitie, the Deitie yéelding glorie and Maieſtie to his Manhood, as the gold adorned and beautifyed the Shittim wood. You remember an other Altar in the Court of the TABERNACLE whereupon all the Sacrifices were offered, and that was of Braſſe, now this ouerlaide thus with gold, and as as it were, of gold. Both of them ſhadowed out Chriſt, and this difference of matter, happely the difference of his eſtate, when humbled here on earth, and when glorified now in Heauen. The braſen Altar ſtanding in the Court, might note his meane accompt in the World before his paſſion. This golden Altar ſtanding in the Sanctuarie, might note his Glorie and Maieſtie in Heauen after his aſcenſion. For the Sanctuarie is a figure of Heauen. The forme of this Altar ſquare, ſignificantly repreſented the firme ſtabilitie of Chriſt who cannot bee ouerthrowne. The Crowne about it, the regall dignitie of Chriſt, and of all thoſe that are ingrafted to him. For wee are kings, and Prieſtes in him and by him. Peter

The hornes of the foure corners, the power and force of our heauenly Altar CHRIST diſperſed ouer the Worlde to the Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South, in ſuch as will beléeue in HIM. The ſweete Incenſe generally noted all duties and ſeruices which the people of GOD doo to him by his appointment and warrant, and that they ſmell ſwéete before him as the Incenſe, and are accepted of him. But particularly the Prayers of GODS faithfull for ſo DAVID in his PSALME expounded it, ſaying, Let my prayer come before thee as the Incenſe, and the lifting 
                        Pſ. 141. 2. 
                        vp of my hands be as an Euening SACRIFICE. And ſo the Cuſtome noted, which was That whileſt the 
                        Luke. 1. 10. 
                        Priest was burning this Incenſe within in the Sanctuarie, the people were without at prayer.
                         Alſo in the Reuelation thus you reade, That the twentie foure Elders 
                        Apoc. 5. 8. 
                        fell downe before the Lambe, hauing Harpes

and Golden Viols full of odours which are the PRAYERS OF THE SAINTS. Againe in the eight Chapter. 
                        Apoc. 8. 3. 
                        An other Angell ſtood before the Altar, hauing a golden cenſer, and much odours was giuen vnto him, that he ſhould offer with the prayers of all Saints vpon the golden ALTAR which is before the throne. This reſemblance was very fit, if you marke it, &amp; ſhewed the Nature of true praier. For what dooth the ſmoake of ye 
                        incenſe but aſcend vpward &amp; ſcatter it ſelfe abroad in the ayre euery way? ſo ſhewing, that the Faithfull Prayers of true Beléeuers aſcend vp to Heauen, and the profit of them diſperſeth it ſelfe far and wide ouer the World, the members of the true CHVRCH praying one for an other through out the Worlde, and beeing profited one of another by naturall prayer, although they liue in ſeuerall countries, and neuer knowe or ſee one another. The burning of this Incenſe vpon the ALTAR which was a figure of Chriſt, ſhadowed out that in Chriſt and for Chriſt onely our prayers are of force with God; and therefore by him they ought to bee offered to GOD, hee himſelfe telling vs, That No man commeth to the FATHER, but by HIM. and whatſoeuer we aske the FATHER in his Name, we ſhall receiue it. No Saint, nor Creature was ſhadowed by the ALTAR of Incenſe, but Chriſt; &amp; therefore let them take heed yt will pray to others, &amp; make others ye 
                        preſēters of their deſires to God. Againe, no ſtrange Incenſe was to be offered vpon this ALTAR, but Prayers either to others than to GOD in the Name of Chriſt, or for vnlawfull and vnfit things, are ſtrange Incenſe, and therefore not to bee offered to GOD. The LORD by the Prophets much complained of Incenſe offered without Faith in thoſe dayes, and prayers without faith, are as odious. Lip-labour, &amp; much babling by number vpō 
                        Beads for to kéepe ye reckoning, is not incēſe yt pleaſeth God. It was forbiden that any man

ſhould make ſuch Incenſe as this in the lawe was, and that alſo ſhadowed, that no creature is to be prayed vnto, but this honor reſerued only to God. Euery Morning and Euening this Incenſe was offered vp, that ſo might bee ſhadowed the continuall vſe and exerciſe of prayer, both when wee riſe, and when wee goe to reſt. The Apoſtle therefore commandeth true CHRISTIANS to pray continually. Thinke with your ſelfe, I 1 Theſ. 5. 17. pray you, as you reade this Note, what fearefull negligence is in this behalfe, and for your owne part neuer be guilty in it, but let the Lord ſmell your ſwéete odours Morning and Euening at leaſt, ſent vp to him, which many wayes he aſſureth you are to him acceptable, and to your ſelfe moſt profitable. Laſt of all, Note it, yt this Altar of incēſe was once in a yeere ſprinkled with the blood of the expiatorie ſacrifice, to ſignifie ſo, that no prayer auaileth any thing with God, vnleſſe he or ſhe that prayeth be reconciled to God in the blood of his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt the true ſacrifice of reconciliation. So haue you this figure of the lawe euery way leading your prayers to God only in the Name and mediation of his Sonne Chriſt, and all other waies and meanes condemned: which, if you be the Lords, ſhall ſo ſinke in your hart, as all the Inchanters of Egypt ſhal not remooue you from yemaner of praying. You may follow the meditatiō
                         further, if you pleaſe.
                     3 Afterward, the Lord ſpake vnto Moſes, ſaying, 
                        Ver. 11. &amp;. 12. &amp;c. 
                        when thou takeſt the ſumme of the children of Iſrael after their number, then they ſhall giue euery man a redemption of his life, &amp;c. Unto the ſeuenteenth verſe. This is the ſecond part or point of this Chapter, concerning a Tribute raiſed vpon the people of Iſraell, toward the maintetenance of the Tabernacle, and what belonged thereunto, and diuers things wee may obſerue in it. Firſt, that to number people in a Land is lawfull, And if you thinke of Dauid, why he was plagued for ſo dooing, ſurely it was not for that he numbred the people, but becauſe he did it in

a pride and confidence in mans ſtrength, which indéede is very odious before God, all victory and proſperitie reſting in the helpe of God, and not in man, or horſe, or any humane meanes. Theſe are things men may vſe, not truſting in them, but in the Lord: but to ſlip from the Lord in any meaſure or degrée, to a confidence and vaine hope in theſe, is moſt ſinfull. The Hebrewes ſay, Dauid offē
                        ded becauſe he numbred the people, and tooke not this Tribute here ſpoken of, according to the lawe. But the former opinion is more like. Among the Romanes we read one Seruius 
                              •
                           ullus firſt ordained this muſtering or numbering of the people, that ſo he might know the number of able men for the warres, the worth of them in worldly eſtate, and ſo impoſe a Tribute accordingly, with other ſuch ends and vſes. But here neither wealth, nor other ſuch ends were reſpected, rather obedience was aimed at, and that they ſhould profeſſe themſelues thus Gods people, him their King, and themſelues his tributaries, and ſo be ſtrongly comforted euer in his protection and defence of them, whoſe power no worldly Princes could match. It was alſo a redemption of their liues, or a matter expiatorie to them, that there ſhould be no plague among them when they were numbred. How often this was, is not mentioned, whether euery yeare, or euerie fiue yeare, as it was in Rome. How Moſes numbred, you Num. 1. 2. &amp;c. may reade in the Booke of Numbers at large. From twē
                        ty yeares olde and vpward they were numbred, and what they gaue, you reade in the Text. That the poore payde 
                           Math. 17. 27. A peece of twentie pence for himſelfe &amp; Peter.
                         as much as the rich, and the rich no more than the poore, it is worthy noting. It was a perſonall tribute, impoſed to teſtifie obedience to God, and therefore equally was payde, to ſignifie that God is no reſpecter of perſons, but ye 
                        poore are as déere and acceptable vnto him (dooing his will) as the rich, we are all wholly the Lords, the price of our redemption is one, the precious blood of the immaculate Lambe Chriſt Ieſus. In worldly matters the rich may

go before vs, but in matters belonging vnto God his ſeruice and worſhip we ought to be as forward as the rich &amp;c. Againe, here may you thinke, what an acceptable thing to God it is, to preſerue ye 
                        Miniſterie &amp; to giue to the Church; on ye contrary ſide, how odious to ſpoile the Miniſtery &amp; to take from the Church, what men &amp; women of better harts than we haue, gaue to the Church. You ſée how this was not poſted ouer to Princes and great men only, but euen priuate men alſo muſt ioyne in this. For if he be borne to inherite Heauen, he muſt thinke himſelfe borne to maintaine the meanes that leade vs vnto Heauen. Our ſhéepe and cattle we prouide for, becauſe they labour for vs and féede vs, what hearts then ſhould wée haue to ſée them comfortably maintained, that labour for vs in a far higher ſort, &amp; féede vs with a much better foode. They draw body and ſoule out of the pit of death, and leade them both to eternall comfort. Of this tribute againe was the queſtion mooued in Chriſt his time. For the Romanes hauing conquered, tooke this tribute to themſelues, which was here appointed for God: and this offended much the Iews: but Chriſt knowing theſe legall types were ended by his comming, bad them giue Caeſar that which was his, &amp; God that which was his. Himſelf alſo paying for himſelf &amp; Peter.

                        Lauer (ſpoken of in the next place) wherein the Prieſtes waſhed their hands and feet when they went to performe their office, plainly reſembled how with vnwaſhen hands we ought not to medle with holy things, that is, with prophane hearts, tongues, or mindes, as they doo, that reade the Scriptures not to guide their liues, but to maintaine table-diſcourſes, &amp; with vnholy tongs ſpeake moſt vnholy and falſe things, drawing the Scriptures to their iudgments, &amp; not framing their iudgments according to the Scripture. The Phariſies were great waſhers of the out-ſide, and ſtill left the in-ſide very foule. Such waſhers ſtill the world is full of. But as Chriſt rebuked that ſuperſtitious folly in them; ſo hee will iudge

ſharpely this hypocriticall mockery in vs. Theſe waſhings againe in the law had a 
                           •
                        urther reach, béeing vſed in Faith, euen vnto the inward waſhing of the ſpirit, whereof they were true Sacraments to the beléeuers. So you ſée by Dauid in his Pſalme, Waſh me O Lord and I ſhall be cleane, that is, inwardly, inwardly, O Lord, by thy bleſſed Spirit, from my foule tranſgreſſion and fall. So you may ſée by the Prophet Eſay 1. 16. &amp; 17. Waſh you make you cleane: (how?) it followeth, take you away the euill works from before mine eyes, ceaſe to doo euill. Learne to doo well, ſeeke iudgment, relieue the oppreſſed; iudge the fatherleſſe, and defend the Widow. This waſhing was ſhadowed by the other, and wrought by Gods holy Spirit as verely in all true beléeuers, as they truly were partakers and vſers of outward waſhings. So the 15. Pſalme alſo, v. 1. Lord who ſhall dwel in thy Tabernacle? euen he that is thus waſhed and made cleane. Read it ouer your ſelfe.
                     5. In the 23. v. it followeth thus, Take vnto thee principall ſpices, of the moſt pure myrrhe ſo much, of ſweete Cynamon ſo much, &amp;c. Thou ſhalt make hereof the holy anointing oyle, euen a moſt precious oyntment, wherewith all things appertaining to the Tabernacle were anointed, and the Prieſtes, ver. 25. &amp;c. No man might vſe this for his priuate vſe, &amp;c. This holy and moſt excellent oyle was a figure of the Holy Ghoſt, without whom nothing is pure, nor ſwéet. All things were anointed therefore, Prieſt, Arke, Table, Candelſticke &amp;c. to teach that all the exerciſes of Religion are vtterly vnprofitable without the inward working of the Holy Ghoſt in our harts, by whō only we are made partakers of Chriſt his holines, Priuate vſes it might not ſerue vnto, nor be for ſtrangers, to maintain ye 
                        reputatiō
                         of it, &amp; to kéep vnder ye proud deſires of corrupt minds. The note in your margin cōcerning ſtrā gers may be looked on. Of ye 
                        perfume the like is ſaide, and happie were men, if all theſe could make them ſée, how

things belonging to Gods ſeruice ought not to be tranſferred to priuate vſes. The Romiſh Church hath taken vpon her, &amp; ſtill dooth, to imitate this ointment &amp; perfume; and therefore their Prieſts ſhewe, that they are rather Prieſtes of the law, than Miniſters of the Goſpell, and by continuing theſe Ceremonies of the law, they (as much as they can) labour to teach, that Chriſt (the end of theſe Ceremonies) is not yet come. What a ſtirre they make in imitatiō
                         of this oyle, who is able to repeat without laughter? The mitred Biſhop he charmes the oyle with certaine words whiſpered and muttered ouer it; then he breatheth vpon it with his vnſwéet breath. Twelue Prieſts ſtand by readie, which (one after one) come and breath into the cup where the oyle is. Then the Biſhop addeth more Charming prayers and maketh mention of Moſes and Aaron, of Dauid, Kings, Prophets, and Martys, deſiring that this Chriſme or ointment when it is made, may haue power to cōfer vpō men ſuch gifts as they in their times were partakers of. With ye 
                        oyle he mingleth a quantity of balme, and then prayeth againe. At length, a Deacon taketh away the cloth that couered ye cup, &amp; then bowing himſelfe, he ſaith, All hayle holy Chriſme, thrée times ouer, lifting his voice higher and higher, he kiſſeth the lipp of the cup, the like doo the 12. Prieſtes in a row, one after another, and then it is a goodly ointment, as they ſay. Now where haue they learned in Gods book theſe toies? let it be noted for our good, they are wholly apiſhe in all their dooings, ſetling their own deuiſes as holy matters for Gods people, &amp;c. In their perfumes &amp; cenſers they are as childiſh againe, and will not ſée it. But let this ſuffice of this Chap.

                        Ver. 2 it may comfortably aſſure vs, that ſuch a care hath the Lord of vs, as euen our very Names are knowē vnto him. He knew the Citie called Damaſcus,
                         he knew the ſtréete in it which was called Streight, he knew the houſe, the rooms vpper &amp; nether, the furniture &amp;c. He knew Ananias Name, Simō
                         the Tanners Name, and here Bezaleel his Name. We accompt it a great matter to be known by Name to the King here on earth, &amp; how much more ſhould we ioy to be known ſo particularly to the King of Heauen? He that beſt knoweth what is true comfort, nameth this by ye

Thanks are to be giuen to this gratious GOD for raiſing vp in all ages ſuch Men. And their cunning workes conſequently may bee vſed, ſo that pride and vanity be abandoned. Nay note the words againe in the Text, and you may ſée, that not only the firſt gift in theſe things is of the LORD, but all increaſe and going-forward in the ſame. For the LORD ſaith, it is of HIM that they ſhalbe able TO FINDEOVT CVRIOVS WORKES, that is, to deuiſe more and Ver. 4. more daylye.

O, what can we thinke of our workes? His Tabernacle-builder muſt be forbidden, and our buildings muſt go on. Reade and féele that place in Ieremie with a tender heart. If the SABBATH bee kept, Kings and Princes ſhall enter in at the gates, &amp;c. 
                        Ier. 17. 25. &amp;c. that is, the Gouernment ſhall ſtand and flouriſh: if not, the LORD will kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it ſhall deuoure the places of Ieruſalem, and it ſhall not bee quenched: that is, the LORD will ouerthrow all with a very fearefull deſtruction. Hee is the ſame nowe that then, and his glorie as déere to him. Let it mooue vs.

                           firſt, follow the words, and note things as they lye. The text ſaith, whē the people ſaw that Moſes taried long ere hee came 
                           Ver. 1. 
                           downe from the mountaine, &amp;c. The cauſes of Idolatrie are moe than can be reckoned vp, but ſome you may here think of: and firſt of this that appeareth in theſe words, impatiencie to ſtay for Moſes cōming down from the Mountaine.
                            Such impaciencie made Saul run to a Witch, &amp; euen at theſe times many to doo the like. God dooth deferre many times his helpe for the tryall of men, and then hauing not his holy Spirit to make them patiēt, they raſhly and haſtily flye to forbidden meanes for help. It was truly ſaid, Feare maketh Gods, to wit, falſe Gods. 
                           
                              Timor fecit in orbe Deos. Lucanus.
                            For in diſtreſſes &amp; agonies, as I ſay, men doe (as here they did) run to wicked deuiſes, thinking ſo to comfort themſelues.

A ſecond cauſe of Idolatrie is often an ignorant imitation of things not rightly vnderſtood, as, becauſe Abraham was commanded to offer vp his ſonne Iſaack, and his readineſſe to doo it ſo wel taken; therefore men would follow him herein and offer vp their ſonnes and daughters with bloudy hands to their falſe Gods. A third cauſe, fooliſh doting loue and affection: Thus was Salomon made an Idolater for his loue to his Wiues. And it is written of Alexander, that he ſo loued Epheſtio, as he decréed diuine honor to be done vnto him. A drian the Emperour did the like to a moſt wicked and naughtie perſon whom he loued. A fourth cauſe, good hap or proſpertie: Thus did the Athenians, who hauing but Ten Thouſand in their armie againſt the Perſians at Marathe (the Lacedemonians being not yet come) it is ſaide a certaine Spirit apeared in their armie in the likeneſſe of Pan, and mightily daunted their aduerſaries, aſſuring them after of victorie in the ſame likeneſſe. Whereupon in great kindneſſe (forſooth) they would euer after worſhip Pan, and built him a Chappell vnder the Temple of Pallas. Thus is mans nature prone to Idolatrie, and taketh very ſmall occaſions to fall from God. The roote of this foule Idolatrie here, was that foule and odious vice of ingratitude, forgetting all the great works and wonders of God done and ſhewed for them; and by name, their ſo comfortable deliuerance from ſuch thraldome and miſerie in Aegypt. Such vice and ſuch effect of it ruleth ſtill in too many whoſe eyes haue bene lightened, and whoſe hearts haue béene comforted with truth of the Goſpell, and yet curſedly and damnably they fall from this kinde God, and run a whoring after their owne inuentions, whoſe wiſdome herin is much like the Thracians, that could not (as Ariſtotle ſaith) number aboue fiue. Wherefore againſt this feareful inconſtancie and mutabilitie of our natures, let vs often vſe (from our harts) the words of the Pſalme, Make me a cleane heart, O God, and renue a right ſpirit 
                           Pſal. 51. 10.
                           
                           within me. Caſt mee not away from thy preſence, and take not thy Holy Spirit from me. Giue me the comfort of thy helpe againe and ſtabliſhe me with thy free Spirit. I am thy ſeruant; O giue me vnderſtanding to learne thy Teſtimonies.
                        
                        2 They gathered themſelues together againſt Aaron, &amp; ſaid vnto him, vp, and make vs Gods to go beforevs. They neuer aſke Aaron, whether it might bee done lawfully or no, but vp, &amp; doo it; moſt preſumptuouſly directing him, who ſhould direct thē, &amp; audatiouſly vrging him to approoue what they liked. Think here of ſome people, &amp; ſome pariſhes, where if ye miniſter will not doo as they fancie, allowing their dācings &amp; drinkings, their bowles &amp; their paſtimes full of diſorder and ſin (for orderly recreatiō is good) they fall out wt him, they turne both hart &amp; hand from him, &amp; he is now become their greateſt enemy, becauſe he hartely wiſheth their ſaluation. But I ſaid I would not amplifie much, and therefore your ſelfe meditate of this hatefull and pernitious boldneſſe in ſome Congregations.
                        3 For this Moſes (the man that brought vs out of the lād of Aegypt) we know not what is become of him. And is this all ye care of him, if he be gone? Such an inſtrumēt of God &amp; good to them, ſuch a deliuerer, ſuch a famous Gouernour, ſo deare to God, ſo familiar wt God, &amp; ſo graced &amp; honoured by God? O ingratitude! O world! and fickle tickle hold-faſt of ye 
                           multitude! A man would haue thought they would haue wept out their eies almoſt, &amp; ſighed their harts in ſunder for ſuch a man, if they had conceited the loſſe of him: But it is not ſo. And therefore by this example let all men be wiſe, &amp; look at the Author of their calling, ioye in their obedience to him, reſt vpon his gratious acceptance, which ſhall neuer fayle a ſingle hart, &amp; leaue the world to be a world full of vnthankfulneſſe to all degrées of well deſeruers. Marke alſo how contemptuouſly they ſpeake of this worthy man, when they ſay, This Moſes, This Moſes, &amp;c.
                            How many circumſtances taught them more reuerence to ſuch an one? make vſe of it, &amp; prepare

for the like. Forewarned forearmed, if it happen.
                        4 Aaron demaunded their golden eare-rings, thinking they would not haue giuen them. For in the Eaſt countries ſuch eare-rings were ornaments, and the pleaſures of women. Tokens alſo of Nobilitie, as the Romanes had their Bullas. But hee was deceiued: ſo pleaſing to our corruption is Idolatrie and ſuperſtition, that no coſt is much vnto vs to ſet forward that. Women in all countries are much wedded to their Iewels, yet to ſuch a purpoſe they will part with them, when vnto goodnes and trueth a verie half-penie grieues them. Reade Nehemiah, 13. verſ. 10. and Agge, 1. verſ. 2. Ut lapis Thracius ignem &amp; flammas

                               (quod eſt ſalutare oleū mitigans dolores vulnerum) fiunt ſegnes ad omnia bona, &amp;c. As the ſtone, that caſt into the water burneth, and hauing oyle powred vpon it, is extinguiſhed: ſo ſome men beſtow much labour about vaine things, and ſpare no coſt; but as ſoone as they heare the voyce of the Goſpell (which is as a wholſome oyle mitigating the griefe of wounds) they become dull and heauie to all goodnes, &amp;c.
                            As wicked Adulterers will beſtow much vpon their harlots, and pinch for any thing to their lawfull wiues: ſo do Idolatrous and ſuperſtitious Verſ. 4. men and women, &amp;c. Aaron maketh them an Idol
                            when he ſaw their rage, and from the folly of the people and the weakeneſſe of the miniſters, what Idolatrie and impietie hath come? Hee maketh it like a Calfe, following the manner of Aegypt, wherein Calues, Oxen, and Serpents were worſhipped, and ſhewing how apt we are to learne the corruption of any place where we ſoiourne and abide. This fearefull fall of Aaron doth not incourage any to fall as hee did, in hope to finde mercie as he did, more than the example of one that hath broken his legg, and beene healed, hearteneth

any man to doe the ſame. But it well teacheth and ſheweth the ſhameleſſe pride of them, who being neither in calling nor giftes like Aaron, yet ſay they cannot erre. I would they ſaw their errors themſelues, aſwell as the world ſéeth them: And being great and grieuous errors, had hearts themſelues to leaue them, and to thinke well of thoſe that for them onely (without any hatred to their perſons) diſſent from them. The Leuiticall High prieſt
                            (by the ordinance of God) was aboue all Prieſtes, and yet Ieremie, Zacharie, and others diſſented from them that had the place. And the Apoſtle giueth it for a true courſe, if an Angell from heauen teach amiſſe, he muſt not be followed, but accurſed. Some haue excuſed Aaron heere, as Bernard: Aaron Sceleratis tumultuantis populi

Therefore, they proclayme a holy day vnto the Lord, not to the Calfe. But did all theſe excuſes mocke God? No, no. The Lord by Dauid ſaith, They worſhipped the molten

                           Image. They turned their glorie into the ſimilitude 20. of a Calfe that eateth hay. And they forgat God (O marke this) they forgat GOD their Sauiour, which had done ſo great things in Aegypt:
                            And therefore the fierce wrath of God purſued them, as followeth. Let it teach our Romiſh Idolaters,
                            what will bée their end, for euen in this ſort they excuſe their worſhipping of Stockes and Stones.

Thoſe Sacrifices were ſuch as God appointed, but now diuerted from their vſe, and therefore nothing leſſe than pleaſing to God. Euen ſo learne you, that although we vſe the ſame words in our prayers, and doe the ſame things ye the Scripture appointeth, as to giue almes, and ſuch like; yet, if we do them not in manner and forme as they are appointed, they differ from right, as theſe Sacrifices did heere; and we prouoke God to his fearefull wrath in ſteade of reward, or any bleſſing. Be not blinded then with the matter, but carefully looke alſo at the manner, and vſe things appointed by God to the verie end that God appoynted them for.

When men haue made vnto themſelues a Golden Calfe, it is a wonder to ſee how they pleaſe themſelues with it, and how they ioy in their abſurd inuention. The Scripture ſpeaketh of workes in ſome places, and of Faith in others, ioyne therefore (ſay ſome) both together in the matter of Iuſtification, and then all is well. This is their Calfe, and who may ſpeake againſt it? Thus thinke of more, Neuer was ye world ſo full of Calues as now, &amp;c.

                           Then the Lord ſaid vnto Moſes, Go, get thee downe: for thy people which thou haſt brought out of the land of Aegypt, hath corrupted their waies, &amp;c. Thus knoweth the Lord euer what men doe, albeit they little thinke of him in their actions. Thus dangerous againe is the abſence of the Paſtor, which is too little thought of eyther by the Paſtor many times, or the flocke. Note it alſo that hee ſaith, tuus populus, thy people,
                            giuing a proprietie, by reaſon of his charge ouer them; it may work good thoughts, if it be meditated vpon, hoth in a people and in a Paſtor.
                        
                        9 Sometimes the Lord indureth mens miſdoings long, and ſometimes ſpeedily he toucheth them, and reſtraineth them, as here. This later is the better if God vouchſafe it, and to be prayed for: more ſinne heaping vp more wrath againſt the day of wrath. The Lord calleth them Moſes his people, ſaying, thy people haue done thus, which thou haſt brought out of the land of Aegypt,
                            when as they were the Lord his people, &amp; by his mightie arme deliuered, not by Moſes his ſtrength. Thus doth the Lord aſcribe to his Miniſters what his power worketh by them, that ſo they may be incouraged in their paynes, and the people knowe to loue them deerely, hearing GOD himſelfe to ſay, that They bee their people.
                        
                        10 They are ſoone turned out of the way which I commaunded them, Soone, ſoone, Note the worde, and

note our manner, if the Lord kéepe vs not in his true obedience, Leuitatem &amp; inconſtantiā notat populi, qui cito &amp;c. and ſend vs good Guides. To fall away from God is fearefull, but ſoone to be turned aſide is an amplification of the fault, and makeh it greater. Pray that neyther the one, nor the other happen vnto vs.
                     
                     
                        The ſecond part.
                        1 AGaine, the Lord ſaid vnto Moſes, I haue ſeene this people, and behold, it is a ſtif-necked people. Now therfore let me alone, that my wrath may waxe hote againſt them, &amp;c. Still obſerue with your ſelfe, how in-wardly God knoweth all people: before he tolde their action, now he telleth their hearts full of hidden contumacie and ſtubbornneſſe againſt him, and let it haue this fruit in you, to make cleane both the inſide and outſide of the platter, that is, watch ouer your actions for they are ſéene of God, &amp; watch ouer your heart from whence your actions procéede, for euen that alſo is well knowen to God. Deceiue your ſelfe you eaſily may, but deceiue him you neuer can. Be wiſe and be warned, qualis vita, finis ita, ſuch life, ſuch end
                            vſually, &amp;c.
                        2 Non abducit ſeruū ab interceſſione pro pop. ſed potius accēdit, vt ignem furoris ſui precum imbre extinguat. Greg. lib. 2. Moral. cap. 12. Bern. conſidera hic, quid precibus tribuatur Sanctorum, quomodo illis Deus teneatur, vinciatur &amp; ligetur. Quis te ligauit Domine Deus? Ligatum habent Sancti Deum, vt non puniat niſi permiſerint ipſi; vt non puniat niſi dimiſſus ipſe. Sermo. 30. ſuper Cantic.
                            That God willeth Moſes to let him alone that his wrath may breake out,
                            it is a place to be laid vp in your heart, and euer to be readie in your remembrance for your comfort. For it ſheweth the incomprehenſible mercie and louing kindnes of the Lord towards ſuch as truly feare him and ſerue him, making them in his goodnes, in his bottomleſſe goodnes (I ſay) ſo powerfull and ſo mightie with him, that they are to him (as it were) bandes to tye him, and a wall againſt him, that he cannot execute his anger againſt offenders, vnleſſe they will ſuffer him, and (as it were) ſtand out of his way. O ſweete God, what is man that thou ſhouldeſt thus fauour him, and haue reſpect vnto him? Is there any thing in man to deſerue this? No, no. It is thy meere mercie and loue to ſuch

as thou pleaſeſt to loue, and the comfort of it vnſpeakeable. When Sodom was to be deſtroyed, what read you? Gen. 18. 19. for ſo many, and ſo many, I will not doe it. In the Prophet Ezechtel,
                            when ſinne ſo abounded, and wrath was ſo due, Ezech. 22. 30 what ſaith the Lord, but thus? I ſought for a man among them, that ſhould make vp the hedge and ſtand in the gap before me for the land, that I ſhould not deſtroy it; but I found none. Therefore haue I powred out mine indignation vpon them, and conſumed them with the fire 
                           31 
                           of my wrath: their owne waies haue I rendred vpon their owne heades. As if hee ſhould haue ſaid, might I haue found but one to ſtand in the gap againſt my wrath, euen for that one, I would haue ſhewed mercie and louing kindneſſe. What a ſpeach of God is that in the Prophet Hoſea? I pray you read it often, and often taſt the ſweetneſſe of it: How ſhall I giue thee vp, O Ephraim? How ſhall 
                           Hoſc. 11. 8. 
                           I deliuer thee, Iſrael? How ſhall I make thee as Admah? How ſhall I ſet thee as Zeboim? My heart is turned within me: my repentings are rowled together. I will not execute the fiercenes of my wrath: I will not returne to deſtroy 
                           9 
                           Ephraim, for I am God, and not man, &amp;c.
                            Could euer father ſpeake more compaſſionately ouer his childe, when he were about to beat him? Surely no tongue can expreſſe the Lords goodnes and pittie. Therefore ſettle with your ſelfe this comfort, that if for other mens ſinnes a true Moſes be ſuch a ſtop to God, that he ſhall not puniſh them, and if tenne righteous perſons, that is, men and women truely louing God, though full of humane weakneſſe, ſhall ſaue ſo many thouſand ſoules as were in Sodom and Gomorrha; nay, if the Lord himſelfe haue ſuch a melting heart towards his poore people, that when the Rod is vp and he readie to ſmite, he ſtayeth his hand of himſelfe, and breaketh into theſe Speaches; How ſhould I doe it? my heart is turned vp and downe in me, &amp;c, what force haue your owne ſighes and grones for your owne ſinnes before him? your true teares flowing from a grieued

heart, that you haue offended him? Can he ſtrike you holding vp your hands for mercie, and looking vpon him with watrie eyes, humbled in the duſt before him, and for Chriſt, Chriſt his deare Sonne in whom he is perfectly pleaſed,
                            begging pardon? O no, no, be aſſured. And therefore euer make vp this wall of defence by true prayer and repentance againſt him, and ſtand your ſelfe in the gap, thus crying to him in his Sonne, againſt your owne ſins, and be aſſured you ſhall preuaile. By Moſes for theſe Iſraelites, and by Chriſt for you, God is ſtopped and will not deſtroy.
                        3 Note againe with your ſelfe, how intollerable a ſinne Idolatrie is before God, when the Lord vſeth ſuch vehement words as theſe, That my wrath may waxe hote againſt them, and that I may conſume them. Thus ſinne our Romiſh Catholikes
                            euerie day, and becauſe God ſtriketh not preſently, they thinke hee will neuer ſtrike. Their Idolatries are many, and you may conſider of them by other learned Treatiſes publiſhed in this matter.
                     
                     
                        The third part.
                        1 THen Moſes prayed and ſaid, O Lord, &amp;c. Heere, Ver. 11. héere then ſée A faithful Magiſtrate, A faithfull Miniſter, A true Shepeheard ouer his people cōmitted to him of God. Who knoweth what iudgements godly Gouernours

                            to God for their people? We ſée this place, we read what Heſter did, and the mercie of God is plaine for their ſakes. It ſhould worke in vs all loue, and obedience, and dutie to them, and make vs day and night pray for the continuance of them. Treaſons and treacheries, raylings and reuilings, ſlaunders and defamations, wrongs and iniuries any way, are not fit requitals of ſuch good receiued by them, and for them. This prayer of Moſes, if you marke it, is moſt vehement, as comming from a mooued heart, and

vſeth vehement and vrging arguments vnto God.

                            (ſaith the text, v. 14.) changed his minde from the euill which he threatned to doe vnto his people: with which comfort Moſes came away, and drawing neere the hoſt, he firſt heard the noyce of ſinging. verſ.

But then, although he were the meekeſt man in the world: yet his wrath waxed hote, and he caſt the Tables out of his hands, and brake them in peeces beneath the mountaine. Which breaking of the firſt Tables, allegorically ſhewed, that the law of God lighting vpon our vnregenerated nature, is brokē (as it were) and by the meanes of our inabilitie cannot iuſtifie vs. But the ſecond written tables are put in the Arke, that is, when God by his Spirit worketh in vs, we are regenerated, and

the law is obeyed of vs, though not fully, yet in meaſure, &amp; this imperfect obedience is made perfect by Chriſt. Aug.

Secondly,

Ambroſe was a man that had ſit in iudgement of bloud before, yet a good Biſhop. &amp;c. ſonnes of Leui gathering to him, he bad euerie man put his ſword by his ſide, goe to and fro, from gate to gate, through the hoſt, &amp; ſlay euerie man his brother, &amp; euerie man his companiō, &amp; euerie man his neighbour. verſ. 27. ſo that there fell of the people the ſame day about three thouſand men. verſ.
                            28. This was the zeale of his heart to the glorie of God, &amp; it muſt be a glaſſe for vs to look in whilſt we liue in this world. The Lord hath placed the commaundements in the Decalogue, &amp; the petitions in the Lords prayer which concern his honor, before thoſe which cōcerne our ſelues; to teach vs, that we ought to prefer his glorie before all worldly things, yea euen life it ſelfe, if they come in Queſtion together. Thus did Shadrach, Meſhach, and Abednego, thus did Daniel, when he he opened his window and made his prayer to God, notwithſtanding that cruell law; thus did the Mother and her

                           ſeuen ſonnes in the Machabees, thus did Elias, Phinees, Dauid and others. Thus did not olde Heli, and therefore the Lord ſmote him. Mine eyes guſh out with teares (ſaith the holy Prophet) becauſe men keepe not thy law. And, doe not I hate them that hate thee, and am grieued with them that riſe againſt thee? Yea, I hate them right ſore, euen as though they were mine enemies. He that loueth Father, or mother, more than mee, is not worthie of mee,

                           now I will goe vp to the Lord, if I may pacifie him for your ſinne. Moſes therefore went againe vnto the Lord,
                            
                           31 
                           and ſaid, Oh, this people haue ſinned a great ſinne, and haue made them gods of Gold. Therefore now if thou pardon their ſinne, thy mercie ſhall appeare: but if thou wilt 
                           32 
                           not, I pray thee, raſe me out of the booke which thou haſt written. When Moſes had fought on Gods part with the ſword, now he ſtriueth for the people with his prayer; ſo, both true to God in a holy zeale, and carefull of his people in the bowels of loue, was this holy man, this faithfull Gouernour and leader of this multitude. Anotable example for all Magiſtrates and all Miniſters euer to follow. But heere is more than I ſaid in the former Note. For here is a preferring of Gods Glorie before euen life and comfort eternall, which is farre more than this temporall life, and all the ioyes of it. So ſhall you ſée in Saint Paule to the Romanes, and what a meaſure Rom. 9. 3. of Gods holy Spirit it was, conſider you. Farre are we from this, that preferre euerie ſmall profit and pleaſure before this glorie of God, and yet ſay, we hope to be ſaued aſ well as they. A true féeling of our owne iniquitie herein may much amend vs hereafter, and God for his Sonnes ſake giue it vs. Againe, you may note here, how Moſes doubleth
                            ouer and ouer in this Chapter
                           
the fouleneſſe of their fault, calling it a great ſinne, a grieuous ſinne, &amp;c. ſo learning you not to extenuate faultes before God, if you ſue for mercie, but to ſet them out in their true colours, that mercie may the more appeare.
                        4 Touching this Booke of life, you muſt know it to be a figuratiue Spéech, borrowed from the manners of men, who vſe Bookes and writings for their memorie, and not conceiue that God hath, or néedeth any ſuch things. It is therefore (in ſenſe) as if Moſes had ſaid, O Lord pardon them, or depriue me of that ſaluation which is as ſure before thee, as if it were regiſtred and written in a book. Such borrowed ſpeeches you haue more in Scriptures, as you may remember. In the Pſalme 
                           Pſa. 139. 16. you read of a Booke wherein, Dauid ſaith Were all his members written, which day by day were faſhioned, when as yet there were none of them. In the Reuelation you read of bookes againe, when he ſaith, I ſawe 
                           Apoc. 20. 12. 
                           the dead, both great and ſmall ſtand before God, and the Bookes were opened, &amp;c. And for the Booke of life, you read perſons written in it of two ſortes, one as it ſeemed, the other true indeed. Of the firſt ſpeaketh the Pſalme, Let them be wiped out of the Booke of the liuing, and not be written among the righteous,
                            meaning wherein they ſéemed to be written, or might perſwade themſelues they were written, but indêed were not. For then they could Dan. 12. 1. Apoc. 20. 12. Luke. 10. 20. not be wiped out. Of the later you read here, and in other places. Where though Moſes ſpeake of raſing out, yet indéede there is no ſuch matter, being nothing but the 
                              Aug. Si homo dicit, quod ſcripſi ſcripſi, multo magis Deus &amp;c. Ezech. 18. 19. 
                           eternall election of God, which neuer can be altered. This is more plaine in the words following, when God anſwered Moſes, that Whoſoeuer ſinned againſt him, he would put him out of the Booke, meaning, hee would make it appeare, that he neuer was written in it. For, the houſe built vpon the Rocke can neuer fall. They

ſhould ſay, but it is impoſſible. Hee that commeth to mee,

                           Laſtly, conſider and note here, how he biddeth Moſes 
                           No certaine time noted, but often were they puniſhed. Aaron was very ſorie: and, Quem poenitet peccaſſe, pene non peccauit, inquit Plautus; &amp; Seneca, qnem poenitet peccaſſe pene eſt. &amp;c.
                            
                           go on with his charge, but for the people he wil viſit them. verſ. 34. And ſo the Lord plagued the people, becauſe they cauſed Aaron to make the Calfe which he made, verſ.
                            35. It telleth Magiſtrates and Miniſters that they may not deſiſt from their dueties for the peoples frowardnes, but indeuouring to their vttermoſt to reforme them, they muſt go on though they periſh; and euen in them ſo periſhing, they ſhall be a ſweet ſauour to the Lord. That Aaron thus eſcaped among them, if you thinke of it, Anſwere your ſelfe, The Lord knoweth whom to ſpare 
                           Dominus nouit cui parcat vſ

                           for their amendment, and whom for a time to ſpare, though he know they will neuer amend. O, how vnſearchable are his iudgements, and his waies paſt all finding out! Grieuous, and thriſe grieuous is the ſinne of Idolatrie, that not for Moſes his ſo earneſt prayer may be fréed wholy from all further puniſhment, though in part the Lord yéeldeth, as verſ. 14. you ſaw. God make it ſinke where it is ſo much vſed by deceiued Romiſh Recuſants.
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. 33.
                     1 GReat was the ſinne which this people had committed, mentioned in the former Chapter; and therefore the Lord (whoſe mercie hath neither bottome nor meaſure) not willing the death of any ſinner, much leſſe of ſo many thouſands, but rather that (by repentance) pardon may be procured; in this Chapter
                         gratiouſly vſeth the meanes that their hearts may ſmite them with true féeling of their fault, and ſo they turne, and be ſpared. Their ſinne (I ſay) was great, and great ſinnes are not ſo eaſily repented of as they ought to be. Againe, in ſinnes of this kinde, namely, when they are coloured and couered ouer with a good intention, by them to ſerue to GOD, moſt hardly are men and women drawen to acknowledge an errour and miſtaking. Matters of the ſecond Table
                         committed againſt our neighbour we much better diſcerne, than matters of the firſt Table
                         concerning the worſhip of God. For here we thinke wholy our meaning ſhould be accepted, which was, to worſhip God, be the thing we do, eyther neuer ſo void of warrant in the word, or neuer ſo contrarie to the word. The meanes that God vſeth here, is by letting them know, that he will be no more with thē
                         as he hath beene, nor trauell with them as he hath done. Verſ. 1. 2 
                        Moſes ſhall goe on with them to the land which God had promiſed to giue thē; And to ſend his Angell to driue out the Canaanites; But himſelf would not go, for they were a

                        4 
                        their coſtly rayment frō thē, not yt this is a neceſſarie
                        
part of Repentance alwaies,
                         but that at this time by this 5 
                        outward ſigne, the Lord would haue them teſtifie that which is néedfull indéed, the true remorſe and ſorrow of their harts. And vpon the hearing of this fearefull newes, 6 that indéed the Lord would thus deale with them, they caſt from them accordingly their beſt attire, and ſorrowed for their fault.
                     2 For further working of this ſauing ſorrow in them, the Tabernacle wherein the Lord will conferre with his ſeruant Moſes, vntill the other (now ſo much ſpoken of) was readie, is, by the appointment of God to Moſes, pitched without the hoſt farre of from the hoſt, that by this Verſ. 7. 
                        ſigne alſo it might be ſhewed, how God was eſtranged from them for their ſinne, who earſt ſo comfortably, and ſo powerfully had ſhewed himſelfe for them, and amongſt them. All which things religiouſly conſidered, manifeſt vnto our ſoules what a ſweete God the Lord whom we ſerue is, who thus ſéeketh his loſt people; euen a father ful of all pittie &amp; compaſſion, that they may returne to him againe, and haue that which ſo ill they haue deſerued, his fauour and loue for euer. Will this God (can you thinke in your conſcience) euer caſt away the poore ſinner that commeth in ſorrow, when he worketh thus to draw men to ſorrow? Féele, and be comforted with it.

                        And when Moſes went out vnto the Tabernacle, all the people roſe vp, 
                         now reuerencing him, whom before they ſpake verie lightly of, ſaying: This Moſes we know not what is become of him. What cauſed this, but that ſtill he was in fauour with God, and they out? So, ſo ſhall a ſound and vpright heart to God euer in the end procure honor, howſoeuer for a time contēpt may be ſhewed: for God will honour them that honour him; it is his Word, and it ſhall neuer fayle. That vnion that was betwixt God and his ſeruant Iohn Baptiſt (when he was true to God, and God truly fauoured him againe) gaue him more honour and good eſtimation in the heart of

                        Herod (though an euill man) than they had whoſe worldly ſhew was farre greater. For Herod feared Iohn
                         
                        Mar. 6. 20. (ſaith the Goſpell) knowing that hee was a iuſt man, and a holy, and reuerenced him, and when he heard him, hee did many thinges, and heard him gladly. Would God then men might be moued to ſéeke honour this way. Surely the Lord is the ſame ſtill,
                         and will make them riſe vp to you, that haue formerly little (and too little) regarded you, aſwell as heere he did to Moſes, if you with Moſes keepe faſt your foote with him when others wickedly fall away, as theſe vnhappie Iſraelites had now done.
                     4 In the 14. verſe, and ſo to the 18, ſée and marke the faithfull heart of a true Gouernour, how he prayeth and neuer giueth ouer till the Lord hath yeelded to goe with this people, as in former time, whereas he had ſaid hee would not do it. O force of faithfull prayer! It ſubdueth all things in time, yea it pleaſeth the Almightie Maker of all worlds maſſes to be ſubdued withit. In the end it preuaileth, though it be long, but ſtil this is mercie, &amp; not merit, 
                        Verſ. 17. no not in Moſes himſelfe. For I will do this alſo that thou haſt ſaid, (ſaith God) becauſe thou haſt found grace in my ſight, and I know thee by Name. Grace
                         it is therefore, and no merit, and a bleſſed grace it is, to ſee and hold it firme, againſt al proud &amp; ignorant Merit-mongers.
                     
                     5 Againe Moſes ſaid, I beſeech thee ſhew me thy 
                        Verſ. 18. 
                        glorie, &amp;c. Hitherto Moſes kept himſelfe in his deſires within the bonds of modeſtie, but now he excéedeth, ſéeking what was neyther lawfull, nor profitable; for ſo by the deniall and repulſe which GOD gaue him, it appeareth. Yet was it not any fooliſh curioſitie that mooued Moſes, but a verie earneſt deſire to bee further ſtrengthned in his charge. Wherefore, if to ſuch a minde, that might be hurtfull which he ſo much deſired, and thought ſo profitable; let it ſchoole vs, and teach vs what we do, when in a vaine curioſitie of our corrupt nature,

we ſearch and prie into ſuch things as God hath kept hidden and cloſe from vs. It is a true ſaying, Mitte quod eſſe nequit, quaere quod eſſe poteſt. Let that alone which cannot be found out, and ſeeke that which may be found out.
                         The Secrets of God are to himſelfe, and reuealed things for vs. He that curiouſly ſearcheth his glorie, ſhall iuſtly be oppreſſed of his Maieſtie. To profit and goe forward in knowedge is good, but the right way muſt alſo be held, which is, To follow God going before, that is, to haue an eare to heare where God hath a mouth to ſpeake, and not elſe.
                     6 But concerning this ſight thus deſired of Moſes to ſpeake a little more, to an ignorant man the Scripture in that point may ſéeme contrarie to it ſelfe. For heere it is ſaid, There is no man ſhall ſee God and liue. And Saint Vers. 20. 
                        Paule that he dwelleth in light not to be attained to, whom no man hath ſeene, neither can ſee. Againe, To the king immortall, inuiſible. And Iohn, No man hath ſeene God at any time.
                         On the other ſide it is often in Scripture teſtified, that God was not ſéene of the old Fathers and Patriarches, and in the Goſpel, Bleſſed are the pure in 
                        Math. 5. 8. 
                        heart, for they ſhall ſee God. Saint Iohn ſaith, We ſhall ſee him as he is. Saint Paule, Now I know in part, but
                         
                        1. Cor. 13. 12. 
                        then ſhall I know euen as I am known. To the Epheſians, That ye being rooted and grounded in loue, May be able

                        to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and height, and depth of Chriſt, &amp;c. But to a diligent obſeruer of the Scriptures theſe places are not contrarie. Therefore conſider with your ſelfe, that Seeing is of two ſorts; with the outward eye, and with the in-ward minde. Concerning the outward ſight (whereby indeed curious and ignorant men would be glad to ſée God, hardly thinking (often times) that there is any God, when none in this ſort can be ſéene) the truth is, God cannot be ſeene. For, if he could, then muſt he be a bodie; &amp; if a bodie, then to be diuided into parts, &amp; included in a place, and ſo

not infinite, and therfore not God. Wherefore groſſe are thoſe Old Heretikes that gaue to God an humane forme, Anthropomorphites monkes. Audiandi. See Epiphan. Becauſe the Scriptures (ſpeaking after our capacitie) giue vnto him the parts of man, as féete, hands, face, &amp;c. And concerning thoſe viſions and apparitions which the Fathers had, as Abraham of three going to deſtroye Sodom, &amp;c. We anſwere with S. Auguſtine, that God appeared vnto them, yet not in his Nature, but in ſuch forme as it pleaſed him. Many ſaw, ſed quod Voluntas elegit, non quod Natura formauit, but what ſaw they? ſurely what his Will choſe, not what Nature formed.
                         Men ſaw him when he would, in ſuch forme as hee would, not in his Nature, wherein he laye hid euen then when hee was ſéene. The Diuinitie when it taketh theſe ſhapes, is not conuerted into theſe ſhapes, but appeareth vnder them. GOD his Nature is ſimple, one, and immutable; thoſe formes in Scripture were diuers and ſundry; therefore by the very diuerſitie of them, We knowe none of them were the true Nature of GOD. Onely in our fleſh wee may ſay GOD was ſéene, after 1. Ioh. 1. 1 
                        Chriſt had taken it into the vnitie of his perſon, but that is not the matter now ſpoken of. So, touching the firſt kinde of ſeeing, with bodily eyes, we conclude, that No man hath, or can ſee God at any time and liue, 
                        Ver. 20. as here GOD himſelfe ſaith in this Text. The ſecond kinde of ſeeing is by minde, wherein wée muſt diſtinguiſh our eſtate here, from that it ſhalbe in the next world. For neither by minde (whilſt wee liue here) are wee able to ſee God as he is. The reaſon; Becauſe all our knowledge is by ſome formes and faſhions which wée conceiue in our mind, and for the moſt part floweth from the out-ward ſenſes; but God (as hath beene ſaid) cannot be perceiued by our ſēſes: Therfore, neither by our mind cā we cōprehend him as he is. And for theſe words in ye 
                        Chap. That ye Lord ſpake to Moſes face to face, as a Māſpeaketh vnto his friend,
                         they note out a more familiar &amp; gratious Ver. 11.
                        
maner of ſpéech, than before was vouchſafed to any, but not any bodily ſight of God in ſubſtance &amp; eſſence, as he is. But in the life to come wée ſhall in far more exellent manner ſée GOD, yet not ſimply, neither as he is, becauſe he is infinite, we ſtill finite although changed from our corruption. So, no way can GOD bée ſéene as he is of any creature, either with his bodily ſenſe, or with his minde in this life, or that to come. Yet ſuch a meaſure ſhalbe affoorded to vs, as no heart can comprehend now ye comfort of it. Let it ſuffice, and bée carefull rather to attaine to it, than curiouſly and vnprofitably to ſift &amp; ſearh Omnia ad Chriſtum rectiſſime accommodātur, qui petra eſt vnica, in qua conſiſtendum fidelibus, qui a poſteriori viſus &amp; agnitus eſt a Iudaeis, hoc eſt, poſt mortem &amp; reſurrectionem ſuam omnis gloria poſterioribus temporibus (interprete Tert.) nobis reuelata eſt. vide Hierony. in Math. cap. 8. in Eccleſ. cap. 4.

                     7 The couering of Moſes face with GODS hand till he was paſt him, is but a borrowed ſpéech from the faſhion of men, who vſe to holde their hands ouer their eyes when they looke vpon the Sunne; for the brightneſſe and glorie thereof is more than their eyes can indure. It is fit therefore to note and teach vs the incomprehenſible Maieſtie and glorie of God, aboue all power in man to looke vpon, but it may not leade vs to any erronious conceipt, ye God hath hands or humane forme, or did thus in any materiall maner. So his back parts note ſuch a meaſure of glory, as Moſes (a mortal man) was able to indure. Otherwiſe, God bath no back nor back parts, but is a Spirit incōprehenſible &amp; aboue al mans ſtrength to know fully as he is, in maieſtie, glorie, ſubſtance, and nature. We may be ſaid to ſee the back parts of GOD, becauſe there is much more which wée know not than which wée knowe, and wée muſt ſtill goe forward while wée liue, in the knowledge of him.

be eſteemed as he deſerueth, becauſe he is greater than our ſenſe. Therefore we rightly eſtimat him, when we ſay hee is ineſtimable. In our minde he is to bee dedicated, and in our breaſt to be conſecrated, &amp;c. Solemne

It is vſuall to call God inuiſible, when indeede he is a moſt cleere light; to call him ineffable, when indeede he hath many Names.
                         The reaſon is, that theſe negatiues or priuations might ſhew the ercellencie of the affirmatiue or habit.

THere is little in theſe Chapters following, which hath not bin touched already in the former: and therefore I may in fewe words end them, and referre you to that which hath béene ſaid. Firſt then, you read here that the former Tables béeing Ver. 1. broken, the LORD renueth them againe. And obſerue theſe things for your good. Moſes is commanded to hewe the ſtones,
                         but the Lord would write in them; ſo may Gods Miniſters by preaching and crying vpon men, as it were hew their ſtoniehearts, that is, prepare them for writing, but onely the Lord muſt write in them by the finger of his bleſſed Spirit and no man can make any thing enter without him. Paul may plant, &amp;c, but HEE, HEE giueth all increaſe. Cathedram in coelo habet, qui corda mouet, His chaire is in Heauen that mooueth the heart. And did God write before the ſtones were hewed? No. Nomore aſſure your ſelfe will he euer in

O Lord, make vs thus readie euer: For here wee haue no abiding Cittie. Early, earely muſt wée aſcend, and ſo did the Apoſtle, when he deſired to be looſed, and to bee with Chriſt: Forward, not backeward was that happie man, and ſo muſt we be.

                     5 Conferre the 6. and 7. ver. with that which was in the former Chapter ver. 18. and ſo foorth, and the one will notably explane the other.

                        earth, and worſhipped. The greater meaſure of manifeſtation of God and his truth is vouchſafed vnto vs, the more ought wée to humble our ſelues and bee thankfull, worſhipping and adoring that God which ſo mercifully dealeth with vs. Againe, when GOD vouchſafeth ſignes of his preſence, let vs haſte vnto him, and not ſuffer him to paſſe away whileſt wée are hindred with this and that. Hee giueth ſignes of his preſence in the Word preached, hee giueth ſignes of his preſence in my heart by good motions. O let him not paſſe away, but make haſte as Moſes here did, bow down and worſhip &amp;c.

                        in thy ſight, that the LORD would now go with vs, for it is a ſtiffe-necked people, &amp;c. The promiſes of God kindle prayer, and ſee it in Moſes here, wherefore vſe (when you are dull to pray) to meditate a time vpon the promiſes of GOD generall, particular, ſo many, ſo ſweete, ſo full of power to inflame an heart halfe dead, and when you féele the fire kindle, then pray, it will flame out at laſt. His prayer is for aſſiſtance in his charge, and well noteth the heauie burden of Gouernment which ſo many deſire yt little think of ye weight. Domoſthenes ſaid if there were two waies before him, the one leading to Gouernment, and the other to death, he would take that which leadeth to death before the other. Aeſchines
                         deſired to be deliuered from Gouernment as from a mad dog. Traian
                         ſaid, who knew the cares of an Emperours Crowne, would not take it vp in the way if he found it there. Such, and many ſuch Spéeches read we, al to note the great charge, and to ſnubbe the vaine ambition of Man. Yet Gouernment is of God, and God in Gouernours, and is honoured greatly, euer was, and will be.

Why dooth God ſubdue? That wée may keepe and keepe diligently what he commandeth, doo this and proſper, as ſhall be good euer; doo it not, and vaine ſhall all ſtrength bée, when the Lords patience is expired, and Iuſtice taken in hand. Publikely and priuately this is true, thinke of it.

But learne here and euer, that God is the true line of mercie, and where he condemneth beware pittie: For that is to condemne him, and to exalt thy ſelfe aboue him in mercie. Becauſe, ſaith the Prophet to Benhadad, thou haſt let him go whom I appointed to die, thy life ſhall goe

                         Falſe Religion (you ſée) in the end worketh deſtruction, and how then is it policie? how better for a Common-wealth, as ſome Romiſh Catholiks
                         vainly haue written? Thirdly, Thou ſhalt

                        offerings of blood will not I offer, neither make mention of their names within my lips. Princes deſtroying Idolatrie and purging the Church, are renowned in Scripture with a bleſſed memorie. Salomon for his mingling was plagued. Valentinian ſought of Ambroſe a Church in Millan for the Arrians, and Ambroſe denyed it &amp;c. But by whom are the Altars to be broken downe? By the Magiſtrate

onely, or by priuate men alſo, and by euery one that is zealous? Surelie publike things by publike perſons in authoritie, Conſtantine, Theodoſius and ſuch like. But for priuate things, priuate men may doo them, as Iacob purged his owne houſe of his Wiues Idols. And Euſeb. lib. 3. the Councill cōdemneth Maiſters that will ſuffer in their Concil. Arelatenſ. Canon. houſes images, and not take them away. Priuate men to meddle with publike things is dangerous. Paul came to Athens, and found an Altar, yet he threw it not down. The Councill decreed, that he which (beeing not a Magiſtrate) 
                        Concil. Eliberin. ſhould breake downe an Image and be ſlaine in the fact, ſhould not be numbred among Martyrs. Theodoret maketh mention of Auda a Biſhop who ouerthrew Pyreum Perſarum, and ſaith thus, that a priuate man ouerthrewe this, I praiſe it not, &amp;c. Extraordinary inſtincts God hath giuen, but let men take heede they be not deceiued. Gideon had Gods inſtinct, euery motion to ſuch matters muſt not be ſuch a warrant. Ambroſe defendeth the Biſhop that burned the Iewiſh Synagogue, 
                        Ambroſe. Epist. 24. and reckoneth one among Martyrs which, in the time of Iulian, threw downe an Altar and was condemned. Our owne times haue yeelded ſome examples. But you ſee, all are not of one minde. Therefore beware of falſe ſpirits that will raſhly write of reformation without tarrying for the Magiſtrate. So euery man may bee a Magiſtrate, and the ſwéete ſocietie of man with man turned to blood and ſlaughter. Some yet are too milde, and they tell vs Idolatrie muſt firſt bee taken out of the heart by true teaching &amp;c. They ſay well, that true teaching goeth before, but what then? Therefore is the Magiſtrates worke excluded? No. For, are not the ſinnes againſt the ſecond Table alſo to be taken out of the hart by teaching? and yet I hope the magiſtrate may concurre with teaching, and puniſh theeues, and murderers, and adulterers &amp;c: Much more in the firſt Table touching Gods honour and ſeruice.

A Recuſants liuing is reſpected, and bodie and ſoule deſtroyed for euer. The father wilfull throweth his déere childe away, and neuer thinketh of the iudgment he ſhall haue with God at his fearefull daye for the ſame. I know where I am, and I ſtay. God in mercie worke féeling and true repentance. Tertullian perſwadeth Chriſtian Widowes to take heede of theſe mariages. Salomon was ouerthrowne by them &amp;c.

                        Aaron and all the children of Iſrael looked vpon him, and behold the skin of his face ſhone bright, and they were afraide to come neere him.
                         Diuers and ſundrie cauſes might cauſe the Lord thus to change Moſes face. Firſt, to aſſure him by this outward token, that his prayers were accepted and Gods fauour againe reſtored to the people. Secondly, that thus the lawe written in the two Tables now the ſecond time, and Moſes alſo the Miniſter of the law, might receiue authoritie and dutifull regard with the people. Thirdly, that it might note Moſes to ſhine with heauenly knowledge and Wiſdome, inſtructed by the Lord for the good of the people. Fourthly, to note that Miniſters faces, that is, their outward actions and words (which appeare to men) ſhould gliſter &amp; ſhine. So let your light ſhine, that mē may ſee your good works &amp;c. Fiftly, to ſhadow that the law which Moſes now repreſented, is onely bright and ſhining in the face, that is, outwardly, for the righteouſneſſe of them that obſerue the lawe for outward actions, is onely a ſeeming iuſtice, ſhining before men, who looke no further than to the out-ward apparance; but before God (who ſéeth the heart and reines) it is none: Whereas the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is all glorious within and without. Sixtly,
                         to teach that

the law lightneth the conſcience which is as the face of ye 
                        in-ward man, making it ſée and know ſinne; but the minde it lightneth not wich any faith to ſaue from ſinnes, Chriſt onely dooing that by his holy Spirit, &amp;c. Therefore the people feare, and dare not approach, the lawe euer ſtriking a terrour into the harts of them that behold their ſins in it, and by it. Moſes himſelfe (ſaith your Chapter) knew not of this glorie of his face. And modeſt men are not carried away with knowledge of their own gifts, but are as it were ignorant of them. Socrates when all men iudged him moſt learned, yet of himſelfe held this both thought, and ſpéech, That he knew nothing. And in matter of our almes, the Lord biddeth, That the right hand know not what the left hand dooth.
                     
                     12 Moſes put a couering ouer his face, &amp;c.

It was figure of the Couer that is ouer our vnderſtanding till the Lord take it away, whereby we are not able to diſcerne the things of God. Pray we therefore euer, that as our Sauiour hath come out of the boſome of his Father to reueale all truth, and hath in his holy Word perfectly taught the ſame; ſo he would be pleaſed to open our eyes, to bore our eares, &amp; to ſoften our harts, that we may receaue to our endleſſe comfort what he hath reuealed. Thus much of this Chapter.

                        ferre them together. Onely I will remember two or thrée things out of the Fathers, not noted before (as I take it) in the 25. Chapter. The firſt is an earneſt and an aftionate Spéech of Origen Ho. 13. in Exod. Domine Ieſu, praeſta mihi, vt aliquid monimēti habere queam in tabernaculo tuo. Ego optarem (ſi fieripoteſt) eſſe aliquid meum in illo auro, ex quo Propitiatorium fabricatur, vel ex quo Arca cōtegitur, vel ex quo candelabrum fit luminis et lucernae: aut ſi aurum non habeo et argentū, ſaltē aliquid inueniar offerre, quod proficiat in columnas et baſes earū: aut certe vel aris aliquid habere queam in Tabernaculo vnde circuli fiant, et caetera quae ſermo diuinus deſcribit. Utinam mihi eſſet poſſibile vnum eſſe ex Principibus, et offere gemmas ad ornamentum pontificis humeralis at
                                 
                                    
                                 
                                 que
                              
                            
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . Sed quia haec ſupra me ſunt, certe vel pilos caprarū habere merear in Tabernaculo Dei, tantum ne in omnibus ieiunus et infoecundus inueniar. Lord Ieſu, graunt that I may haue ſome monument in thy Tabernacle. I woulde wiſh, if it could be, that ſome part of that gold might cōe from me whereof the propitiatorie is made, or with which the Arke is couered, or whereof the Candleſtick is made, or if I haue no gold or ſiluer, at the leaſt I may be found to offer ſome thing that may helpe froward the pillars

and ſockets of them: or that I may haue ſome braſſe in the Tabernacle, whereof the rings may be made, and other things preſcribed by thy Word. O that it were poſſible for me to be one of the Princes, and to offer precious ſtones to the adorning of the Prieſtes garment! But becauſe al theſe are aboue my power, at the leaſt let me finde fauour to offer goats haire in the Tabernacle of God, that I be not found emptie &amp; vnfruitfull in all. Let this deuout Spéech much mooue thee good Reader. The ſecond thing is, concerning the ſkilfull workemen Bezaleel and Aholiab. For the firſt beeing well deſcended of the honorable tribe of Iuda, &amp; the 2. not ſo well, but from a more vnnoble tribe, yt tribe of Dan, it affoordeth vs this good obſeruatiō; yt God beſtowes not his gifts euer according to birth, but maketh them in vertue equall whom earthly reſpect &amp; humane deſcent haue made very vnequall. Neither doth he yéeld them praiſe for birth, but for gifts &amp; graces of his Spirit in themſelues, and for a ſingular abilitie to teach others, which euery man cannot doo, either by ſome impatiencie in his nature, or for ſlouth, or for one thing or other. Uery well therefore ſaid S. Hierom, Summa apud Deum nobilitas clarum eſſe virtutibus: neſcit religio noſtras perſonas, nec cōditiones hōinū, ſed animas inſpicit. In Epiſt. ad Caelantiū. It is the chiefeſt nobility with God, to be indued with vertue: Religion knoweth not our perſons, neither dooth it looke vpon the conditions of men, but vpon their minds. Thirdly,
                         in the example of theſe worthy workemen, is notably commended vnto vs the vertue of agreement and conſent in the Lords worke, that they ioyne and are not ſeuered: A thing of great conſequence if I would follow it by diſcourſe. But God make vs all follow it in our places: their faithfulneſſe in not conuerting any thing to their owne vſe, and many other good things might be noted in them: but I ſtay.

                         of this Chapter, concerning theſe workemen thus raiſed vp of God, and inabled with ſkill for this great worke. In this place note the ſingular liberalitie of the people to this houſe of God, when they brought ſo much that they were ſtayed and ſtopped from bringing 
                        Verſ. 6. 
                        any more. O, where are theſe hearts now a daies? Note alſo the rare faithfulneſſe of the workemen, who gaue notice of this bountie, and ſaid, verſ. 5. It was more than needed,
                         being much of it gold, and pretious ſtones, and coſtly things. What might they in ſuch plentie haue put aſide for their priuate profite, if they had béene men of ſuch a ſtampe? Thirdly, ſée the Magiſtrate in this matter, how he alſo wil not haue the people further charged than is cauſe, when once he knoweth of it. All theſe are examples to vs, to learne in our ſeuerall places to doe the like, that with God and man wee may reape like commendation.

                        OBſerue how often in this Chapter is repeated (as the Lord commaunded,) and ſee how ſweete commanded obedience is. Were it as ſwéete to God to be ſerued with inuentions, neuer would theſe Repetitions be made. Beware therfore of theſe waies, and in verie reaſon conclude, that if you looke of your ſeruant ſeruice according to your will, and not according to his; much more may God. And if your commaundement be a diſcharge to your ſeruant, much more is God to his a ſure reſt and comfort.

Againe, that the inuiſible grace is of force without the viſible ſigne, when God will haue it ſo, as in Moſes here.

were thoſe men (thinke you) that were thus directed. And is God now changed? No, no: in his word he is, and by his word he offereth to lead you to the true Canaan in heauen as comfortably, as plainely, and as powerfully, as he did his people by theſe outward meanes, vnleſſe you be wilfull and will not follow. Looke therefore, in his name I beg it, at his word: haue it, read it, loue it, &amp; meditate vpon it, and continually (as you may) exerciſe your ſelfe in it. It will ſet you at the laſt where all the pleaſures of the world cannot ſet you, and from whence you would not come (when once you are there) for ten thouſand millions of ſuch worldes.

A great motiue to ſtirre vp all God his people, both to the reading of it, and to a verie great obſeruing of whatſoeuer we read in it. We ſee by experience, that, if a man happen to finde any old and ancient Monument of ſome Famous man, that liued many yeeres ago, with any inſcription of old Letters or Characters, how he reioiceth at it, keepeth it, ſheweth it to his friends, and is neuer wearie of it. Much more ſhould it pleaſe vs to view and marke the ancient Figures of this Booke, wherin (as in pictures) Ieſus Chriſt, the great King of all Kings, and the eternall Sonne of almightie God was ſet-out and expreſſed to the world before he came, and ſtill moſt

profitably noted and knowne now, when hee is come. Let vs therefore begin to read this heauenly Booke with comfort, &amp; continue the ſame with conſtancie, to the end. And (moſt gracious Father) for thy deere Sonnes ſake, I beſeech thee, throw my ſins out of thy ſight, that make me vtterly vnworthy to come nere thy word, much more, both to taſte the ſweetnes of it my ſelfe, and to be a means that others may doe the like with mee. And as it hath pleaſed thee to vouchſafe mee a place of teaching in thy Church, with many and many mercies more, &amp; to ſtir my heart vp to this courſe of doing ſome part of my dutie in the ſame; ſo vouchſafe to giue power to my will, and to enable me with thy grace, that I may ſee and ſet downe, obſerue and note what may bee to this end; namely, to worke, both in mine owne ſoule, and in the hearts of thy deere Choſen, knowledge and feeling of thy heauenly truth, that may bee to the praiſe of thy vnſpeakable goodneſſe and our owne aeternall comfort for euermore. O grant it, (ſweet Lord) grant it, and be ſtrong in weakeneſſe, as thou haſt promiſed to be. Let no ſinne of mine, or of thy people that ſhall euer vſe my poore labours, hinder and hold this mercie from vs.

                     CHAP. I.
                     
                        
                           BEfore you come to the words of the Text, you may conſider in your minde, why God ſhould inſtitute and appoynt ſuch a kinde of worſhip as this, hereafter deſcribed in this Booke; ſéeming to be delighted with the ſlaughter of Cattle, and liuing creatures, to his ſeruice. And (the rather) I wiſh you to thinke of this point, becauſe we read of ſome in old times, that by reaſon hereof, and by the commandement, and approbation of warres alſo (wherein men, women, and children are often ſlaine with great rigor and force) haue condemned the holy Law of God, his ſacred and Diuine word, as not agréeable to his Nature, who is all good, and not delighted with ſlaughter and crueltie, but with louing mercie, and mildneſſe, vnitie, amitie, and peace. Such were the Cerdonian and Marcion Heretickes, as witneſſe Turtullian, and Auguſtine. Others haue fallen into this fooliſh and falſe conceite, that there were two Gods; one God, the Father of Chriſt, and the Authour of the new Teſtament: the other, ſeuere and ſowre, cruell and bloody, the Authour of the olde Teſtament, wherein ſo many commandements, concerning blood by warres, and by ſacrifices, are giuen. Againe, Lucian, that prophane Scoffer, ſcoffed and ieſted at this kind of worſhip by blood, and death. The former folly is ſo groſſe and ſenſeleſſe, as in our dayes (God be bleſſed)

it néedeth no confutation. For we well know, that euen the Scriptures of the olde Teſtament alſo, Came 
                           2. Pet. 1. 21. 
                           not by the will of man, but holy men of God ſpake as they were moued by the holy Ghoſt. We know the Law it ſelfe is holy and vndefiled, giuen (as a good Schoolmaſter) Pſal. 19. 7. 8. 9 to lead vs vnto Chriſt. And euen the whole Scripture together, Olde Teſtament and New, Law and Goſpell, is giuen by inſpiration of God, &amp; is profitable to 
                           2. Tim. 3. 16. 
                           teach, to improue, to correct, &amp; to inſtruct in righteouſnes, That the man of God may be abſolute, being made perfect 
                           17. 
                           vnto all good works. The other poynt may be a litle touched; namely, his prophaneneſſe, that reſted at this worſhip, and thought it vnfit. Wherein firſt, let vs conſider, that not man deuiſed it, and God approoued it; but euen God himſelfe both deuiſed it, and accepted it. For the firſt man Adam, was taught of God, and he taught his ſonnes, Cain and Abell: otherwiſe, in Faith could not Abell haue ſo worſhipped; Faith being 
                           Heb. 11. 4: Rom. 10. 17. 
                           by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. So from man to man it procéeded as the Wil of God in all generations, and was vſed with the godly as the forme of dutie, which God required of them and allowed. And now here in your Chapter, the words are thus. Now 
                           Verſe 1. 
                           the Lord called Moſes, and ſpake vnto him out of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, &amp;c, concerning this kinde of worſhip. Whereupon it followeth, that, being his owne appointment (who is wiſedome it ſelfe, iuſtice it ſelfe, and all goodnes) fleſh and blood, duſt and aſhes ſhould not dare to cenſure it, but as good, although no reaſon thereof could appeare to his vnderſtanding.
                        The ſingular vſe of it, and great fitneſſe to the ende God appointed it for, will after appeare in the whole Booke by noting the particular Sacrifices mentioned, and commanded. But in the meane time, although God be not bound to giue reaſons euer to vs of his Will, nor we bound to ſearch out for them, but humbly

and obediently to reſt in his good pleaſure, made knowne by his Word: yet if we thinke he choſe this courſe to confound the wiſedome of the wiſe, we ſhall not thinke amiſſe. For all the learned Writings and wiſe Lawes deuiſed by man, to make people good, could neuer worke ſo much to that end, as this did, in ſuch as tooke the right vſe of it. The more therefore any deſpiſed it, &amp; thought it folly, the more did it ouerthrow him in his iudgement, and prooue his wiſedom to be ſtarke folly.
                        2 Yet, concerning the continuance of this kinde of Worſhip, the Lord neuer intended, it ſhould be perpetuall; but onely for a time, namely, till that great Sacrifice (figured and ſhadowed by all thoſe Sacrifices) ſhould be exhibited and giuen vnto mankinde, according to the Scriptures, with whom all ſhadowes ſhould ceaſe and take an end. And this was well knowne to ſuch as rightly vnderſtood the Scriptures, albeit to ſome others it was not tollerable doctrine, but very dangerous to be touched. The Prophet Dauid vnderſtood it, when he ſaid, Sacrifice and Offerings thou 
                           Pſal. 40. 8. 9. 
                           wouldeſt not haue, but mine eares haſt thou opened. Sacrifice for ſinne haſt thou not required, then ſaid I, Loe, I come. The Prophet Malachie ſpake of it, when he alleageth Mal. 1. 10. the Lord ſpeaking thus. I haue no pleaſure in you, ſaith the Lord God of Hoſtes, neither will I accept an Offering at your hand. For, from the riſing of the Sun, 
                           11. 
                           vnto the going downe of the ſame, my Name is great among the Gentiles, and in euery place (Marke this) Incenſe ſhall be offered vnto my Name, and a pure offering: for my Name is great among the Heathen, ſaith the Lord of Hoſtes. Agréeable to which place, are the words of Chriſt to the woman, in the fourth of Iohn: Woman, 
                           Iohn. 4. 21. 
                           beleeue me, the houre commeth, when ye ſhall neither in this Mountaine, nor at Ieruſalem, worſhip the Father &amp;c. Alſo the Apoſtle Paule his words: I will that the men 
                           1. Tim. 2. 8.
                           
                           pray, euery where, lifting-vp pure hands, without wrath, 
                           
                              
                                 •
                              empiterno ritu. 
                           or doubting. Whatſoeuer therefore you read in the Word of the perpetuitie of this kinde and forme of worſhip, you muſt ſtill take it by reſtraint, vnto the comming of Chriſt, and the continuance of that common wealth and policie of the Iewes, not longer.
                        3 Touching theſe Sacrifices and Rites, we are to know, and euer remember, that God neuer inſtituted and ordeined them to be meritorious, and euen by the workedone (as we ſay) to appeaſe the wrath of God, and deſerue eternall life. For ſo thought ſome Hypocrites in thoſe dayes, and are ſharply, and often rebuked for it. And the Apoſtle telleth vs plaine, The blood of Bulles and Goates cannot take away ſinne, &amp;c.
                        
                        4 They were not appoynted to be onely Allegories of good workes, and ciuill vertues, and darke deliniaries of a politicall life, as were the Symbols of Pythagoras, or the Hieroglyphicks of the Egyptians: And yet there may be a fit application of them this way. For indéed they do ſhadow-out ſuch vertues, as the Sacrifice of Chriſt ſhould worke by Faith in true beléeuers, but I ſay, they were not inſtituted onely for this purpoſe, but ye holy Ghoſt looked at higher matters in theſe Ceremonies, namely, that they might ſhadow-out the Lord Jeſus, the promiſed Meſſias, and the true Sonne of God, and that Sacrifice which he ſhould make of himſelfe for the Redemption of all mankinde vpon the Croſſe according to the Scriptures, that they ſhould nouriſh and maintaine the promiſes hereof in mens hearts, and that ſauing Faith hereupon ſpringing in him, &amp; in him onely to be ſaued for euer. For euery Sacrifice was a Sermon of this matter, of his comming, of his ſuffering, of his death &amp;c. And by ſuch viſible ſights the Goſpell was preached, concerning life by him. Thus iudged S. Iohn, when he ſayd, Behold the 
                           Iohn 1. 36. 
                           Lambe of God &amp;c. as if he ſhould haue ſaide, that

                           Lambe, that was ſhadowed by all the Lambes and Sacrifices of the Law. Hetherto tend the words of Saint Paul to the Epheſians, Chriſt hath loued vs, and hath giuen 
                           Epheſ. 5. 2. 
                           himſelfe for vs, to be an offering and a ſacrifice of a ſweet ſmelling ſauour to God. The words of S. Peter; Knowing, 
                           1. Pet. 1. 18. 
                           that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſiluer and gold, from your vaine conuerſation receiued by the tradition of the Fathers: But with the precious blood 
                           19. 
                           of Chriſt, as of a Lambe vndefiled, and without ſpot. The words of Saint Iohn, The blood of Ieſus Chriſt clenſeth 
                           1. Iohn. 1. 7. 
                           vs from all ſinne. In the Reuelation, The Lambe ſlaine 
                           Apoc. 13. 
                                 〈◊〉
                              . 
                           from the beginning of the world. How? Surely not onely in the purpoſe and appointment of God, but by the Sacrifices which were offered euen from the beginning. For by all ſuch, his death was ſhadowed, and he as it were ſlaine (to the faith of man) as often as any Sacrifice was offered. The whole Epiſtle to the Hebrewes alſo, in full manner teacheth thus much, and marke the words well in the 10. Chapter. The Law had 
                           Hebr. 10. 1. 
                           the ſhadow of good things to come &amp; not the verie image of the things.
                        
                        5 For the varietie of them, there were many ſorts of ſacrifices, and yet but one Chriſt, to be ſignified by them all. This did the Lord in great mercie and wiſedome, that ſo his people fully buſied, and pleaſed with ſuch varietie, might haue neither cauſe, nor leaſure to looke vnto the wicked Idolatries of the Heathens, according to the ſeuerall charges giuen them of God, To beware leſt 
                           Deut. 12. 30. 
                           they were taken in a ſnare, to aske after their Gods, ſaying, how did theſe Nations ſerue their Gods, that I may doe ſo likewiſe? &amp;c. Séeing all the abhomination that God hateth they did vnto their Gods, burning both their Sonnes and Daughters with fire to their Gods, and the Lord would haue them doe onely what he commanded, putting nothing vnto it, neither taking any thing from it. Secondly, although Chriſt be but one, and his

Sacrifice but one; yet great is the fruit, and many ſeuerall mercies flow from him, and his death vnto vs. By him our ſinnes are daſhed and waſhed out, by him Gods wrath againſt vs is appeaſed, by him we are adopted and taken for the Sonnes of God, and Fellowheires with him, by him we are iuſtified, and indued with the holy Ghoſt, inabled thereby to die vnto ſinne, and to liue vnto righteouſneſſe, walking in his holy Commaundements with comfort, and longing for our deliuerance out of this vale of miſerie, That we may bee cloathed with our houſe, which is from Heauen, &amp;c. Diuers 2. Cor. 5. 1. ſorts of Sacrifices therefore were appointed, to note, by that varietie, the varietie of theſe fruites of Chriſt to all beléeuers, though he be but one. Thirdly, and laſtly, there were many ſorts of Sacrifices, that ſo plainely the Church might ſée, that theſe kinde of Sacrifices were not the true Sacrifices for ſinnes. For if any one had béen able to take away ſinne, the other had béen in vain added: as the Epiſtle ſayth to the Hebrews, Thoſe ſacrifices which by the Law were yeerely offered, 
                           Heb. 10. 1. 
                           could not ſanctifie the commers thereunto. For then would they haue ceaſed to haue been offered, becauſe the 
                           2 
                           offerers once purged ſhould haue had no more conſcience of ſinnes, &amp;c. Therefore, as I ſay, the varietie and multitude of them was of purpoſe to ſhew (amongſt other things) the inſufficiencie and weakeneſſe of them. In the ſecond, and 14. verſes of this Chapter you may ſée, and note, of what things they might offer ſacrifice lawfully; Namely, Of Cattell, Beefes, and Sheepe, verſ. 2: and, of foules, Turtle Doues, or young Pigeons, verſe 
                           Verſ. 2. 14. For, what God commanded that only might they lawfully doe, neither adding, nor diminiſhing. Therefore, deteſtable before God was that offering of men and children, that we read of, both amongſt Jewes and Gentiles. Of the Jewes, the Pſalme ſayth, They offred their Sonnes and Daughters vnto Diuels. And againe,

                           They ſhed innocent blood, the blood of their Sonnes and Daughters, which they offred vp to the Idols of Canaan. Of the Heathens, read how the King of Moab, in his diſtreſſe tooke his Sonne, and offered him, &amp;c. 2. Kings, 3. 27 Lactantius de falſa religione lib. 1. cap. 21. Euſeb. de preparatione Euang. lib. 4. cap 7. Arnob. lib. 8. Aug. de ciuitate Dei. lib. 7. cap. 14. See more examples of this crueltie.
                            Happily theſe Heathens had it from the Patriarches, that a man ſhould come, by whoſe Sacrifice Gods wrath ſhould be appeaſed: and they not vnderſtanding how that ſhould be, namely by Chriſt, founded therevpon this bloody cruelty to offer vp men and children in ſacrifice. Or elſe, in their reaſon, they framed this argument, that if Sacrifices of Béefes, ſhéepe, and foules, were acceptable to God, much more muſt néeds be offerings of men. But it was not ſo, the Lord commaunding the one, and abhorring the other. Concerning theſe lawfull Sacrifices, a good Note is giuen; that foraſmuch as God is pleaſed, to receiue his Sacrifices of ſuch thinges, as man hath for his common meat, béefe, and ſhéepe, &amp;c. Why ſhould vile earth and aſhes ſo hunt for delicacies to pamper vp their ſinfull bodies, as they doe, neuer thinking any thing daintie ynough, that may be gotten for the things ſacrificed.

God would haue theſe things ſacrificed vnto him, which the Egyptians worſhipped for Gods: to wit, of foure▪ footed creatures, the Calfe, the Goat, the Shéepe; of ſoules, the Turtle Doue, young Pigeons, &amp;c. that being thus appointed for ſacrifice, the Iſraelites might well know, and ſée, that they were no Gods: but that they ought to worſhip him onely, to whom all theſe things were offered. So of vncleane things &amp;c.

When the Floud was ceaſed, and Noah ſhould enter out of the Arke, to comfort his heart after ſuch a great danger, and heauy iudgement of an angry God, vpon all fleſh, and to aſſure his ſoule of Gods gracious fauour, to continue towards him, for future times, as it had mightily ſhewed it ſelfe for the time paſſed, He built an Altar to the Lord, and tooke of euerie

                           cleane beaſt, and of euerie cleane foule, and offered a whole Burnt Offering vpon the Altar. The Lord, pleaſed therewith, gaue him comfort accordingly, and promiſed no more ſo to curſe the ground againe for mans cauſe, neither 
                           21. 
                           any more to ſmite all thinges liuing, as he had done. 
                           22. From thence forth there ſhould be againe ſeede-time &amp; harueſt, cold and heat, Summer and Winter, day and night, ſhould not ceaſe ſo long as the earth remayned. When the Iſraelites endeauouring to reuenge that great wickedneſſe of the Beniamites to the Leuites wife, and were twiſe fearefully ouerthrowne by the Beniamites, then 
                           Iudg. 20. 26. 
                           they went vp to the houſe of God, and wept, and faſted, and offered Burnt Offerings, &amp;c. When the Philiſtines came vp againſt Iſrael to fight with them, and the Iſraelites 
                           1. Sam. 7. 8. 9. were ſore affraide, then Samuel offered a Burnt Offering
                           
to confirme and comfort them, and behold the effect; the Lord thundred with great thunder vpon the Philiſtines, and ſcattered them, ſo that they were ſlaine before Iſrael.
                            When that great plague was amongſt the people, for Dauids ſinne in numbring the people, then in that griefe of minde, and woe of heart for his owne fault, and the peoples death, Dauid bought the threſhing floore of Aranah, &amp;c. And offered Burnt Offerings
                            
                           2. Sam. 24. 24 25. 
                           vnto the Lord, wherevpon his comfort followed: The Lord was appeaſed towards the Land, and the plague ceaſed from Iſrael.
                            Thus might I wearie you with Examples, but I will adde but one more, the example of Salomon, who béeing brought of God, to the Kingdome of his father Dauid, and wiſely weighing the great charge and burthen of it, as alſo his owne want of experience, and ſkill, to guide ſo great a ſhip, troubled and perplexed in his heart, betwixt a deſire to doe well, and a feare to light ſhort of what he deſired, through his owne weakeneſſe, got him in this agonie to his God, and offered Burnt Offerings, which likewiſe had effect to his ioy, the Lord ſaw him, and heard him, and gaue him both wiſedome for his charge (which he 1.

Sée then, as I ſaid, the vſe of this kinde of Sacrifice in all feares, and troubles, when comfort was wiſhed, and a ſtrong ſtable heart in Gods promiſes, till the time of the ſame co
                              〈…〉
                           
                           fort came, without fainting, or falling away.
                        Secondly, after obſeruation, in what caſe the burnt Offering was vſed, let vs conſider the maner and circumſtances of it, which likewiſe you ſée in this third Uerſe, &amp;c. Firſt, it muſt bee of the Herde or flockes (if it were a beaſt) not a wild Hart, Bore, Beare, Woolf, &amp;c. For theſe kinde of creatures being fierce, ſauage, cruell, and by force brought to death, not otherwiſe,

could not be figures and ſhadowes of a méeke, milde, ſwéete, and gracious Sauiour, who willingly and louingly ſhould euen lay downe his life for vs; that wée by his death might be ſaued. Secondly, it was required 2 
                           to be a Male. The Male is ſtronger, and perfecter than the Female, and therefore fitter to ſhadowe and ſhew the ſtrength, and perfection of Chriſt in vanquiſhing ſinne, death, druill, and hell, which the mightieſt Monarche, the earth euer had, could neuer doe. Thirdly, 3 it was required, that it ſhould be without blemiſh, that is, not blind, not lame, nor broken, and ſo foorth, as you may read, Leuit. 22. ver.
                            22. which when the Iewes obſerued not, ſée how the Lord complaineth, Malachie, 1. 8. If any man thinke theſe bodily imperfections ſmall things to be regarded of God, it is very true: but for an expreſſe commandement of God to ſtubbornely broken by duſt and aſhes that ſhould obey, is no ſmall matter. If we looke at the Apple eaten by our firſt Parents, it was but an Apple, a matter of ſmall moment; but when the Commandement ſaide, no, and yet they did it, their fault was not ſmall, and ſo the puniſhment ſhewed. Therefore euer in the Commandements of God, we muſt not regard ſo much the thing, as his Will, who (being our maker) may command what he will, and his will being euer iuſt, holy, wiſe, and for our good, if we haue grace, ought to be obeyed preciſely, carefully, and chearfully. This condition of the burnt Sacrifice figured out the puritie of that Lambe, that indéede had no blemiſh any way, no guile found in his mouth, but ſo cleane as by his cleanneſſe, his righteouſneſſe béeing imputed vnto vs, his Spirit dayly worketh our Sanctification, and newneſſe of life from ſinne and vncleaneſſe. Fourthly, your Chapter ſaith, it muſt be preſented of voluntary will, ſo to figure 4 out that Chriſt ſhould willingly (not conſtrainedly) giue himſelfe to death for mankinde; and, peraduenture

alſo, to ſhew that God neuer liketh of conſtreyned ſeruice, but will haue men doe their duties to him voluntarily, as indéed is fit of the creature to the Creator euer. Fiftly, it muſt be preſented at the doore of the 
                           5 
                           Tabernacle, God tying them to a place appointed by him, and not ſuffering them to ſacrifice where they liſted themſelues in euery place. Deut. 12. 13. 14. as in Leuit. 17. 4. 2. Chron. 28. 29. Ezech. 6. Oſe. 4. the Margin the places are noted. If this thought come in your minde, why God ſhould thus tye them to a place, when as (for the ſhadowing of Chriſt, and confirming the faith of the Godly) it ſeemeth rather, it ſhould haue béene lawfull euery where to ſacrifice, becauſe euery where Chriſt is a comfort to all beléeuers, and Faith in al places ſhould receiue her appointed helpes, to make ſtrong and ſtable from deſpaire, or doubt. You againe may remember, that there were two reaſons chiefly of this Commandement. The firſt, is expreſſed in Leuit. Chap. 17. ver. 3. &amp;c. Namely, that by this meanes, they might be ſtayed from vſing any vnlawfull maner in their Sacrifices, and from following the faſhions of their adioyning neighbours, the Heathens, which happily they might haue done, if in euery place, at their pleaſure, they might haue ſacrificed. The ſecond reaſon was, to ſignifie by this means, that he only was the true Sacrifice for ſin, whom that Mercie ſeat, there in the Tabernacle, did repreſent, &amp; which in that place, where after the Temple ſhould be built, to wit, in Ieruſalem, ſhould offer himſelf for our ſinnes. If you aſke whether (by this example) at this day, a certaine place be requiſite? you may remember, that, euen by this example and true experience, wiſely our Elders haue both thought of &amp; prouided, that in every Pariſh there ſhould be a publike place, euen a Church or Chappell, whither, (except in caſe of neceſſitie) all people of that Limyt, ſhould come to performe their duties to God, publiquely after one maner, not allowed at their wil, euery

one to haue a ſeuerall place, leſt priuate places ſhould bréede priuate fancies, errors, and hereſies, ſchiſmes, and deuiſions in the Church. Sixtly, vpon 6. the Burnt Offering, you read here, they muſt lay their hand euen vpon the head of it. verſ. 4. And diuers good things were taught hereby to them that vnderſtood rightly thoſe Ceremonies, then vſed. For firſt, the partie bringing that Sacrifice did by this means acknowledge, that he himſelfe deſerued to dye; but (by the mercy of God) he was ſpared, and his deſert laid vpon the beaſt, for which he ought to be thankfull. Secondly, as that beaſt then was to die for him, and to be offered in Sacrifice; ſo did he beléeue Chriſt ſhould come, and die for him. Thirdly, that it is not enough to beléeue that Chriſt ſhould come, and die for ſinne, but he muſt put his hand vpon Chriſt, that is, lay vpon him all his iniquities, by the hand of his Faith; apply Chriſt to himſelfe, and beléeue that hée muſt die then, and wée now, that he hath dyed for his ſinnes, my ſinnes, your ſinnes, &amp;c, Being the onely propitiation for ſinne. The Iewes put their hand vpon the workes of the Law, the Heathens vpon their deuiſed worſhips, Hypocrites vpon their almes, faſts, prayers, &amp;c, Making theſe things ſatiffactorie to God for them, and ſo wronging the Lord Jeſus, &amp; his All-powerfull blood. Fourthly, this laying on the hand ſhewed, that men bringing Sacrifices to God, ſhould rather ſacrifice themſelues, and all their exorbitant affections, than that beaſt. For manie are content to giue their goods to God, but themſelues to the deuill, which God abhorreth. Laſtly, this Ceremonie taught them, of what minde they ſhould be when they offered; namely, of this, that they thought the fauours and mercies of God ſo great and gracious towards them, that if they ſhould euen offer themſelues to the death for him, and indéede dye as that beaſt muſt, yet no recompence would that be, worthy

ſuch a louing Lord, and anſwerable to ſuch his great kindneſſe. When it is ſaid in the Text, that ſuch ſacrifice ſhould be axcepted to the Lord, to be his atonement, verſ
                            4. and in the 9. verſ. for a ſweet ſauour vnto the Lord,
                            or a ſauour of reſt, which pacifieth the anger of the Lord, theſe promiſes being no deceiuings of men, but true, as ye Promiſe-maker is euer true: We muſt note and conſider, that there was a ſatiſfying power in thoſe Legall ſacrifices, whereby the right Offerer was looſed and cl
                              •
                           ered from guilt in the ſight of God: not that brute creatures of thēſelues could doe thus, but as they were true figures of Chriſt and grace by him to be obtained, and had ſacramentally. Therefore they ſatiſfied and helped, or reconciled to God, as at this day we are waſhed ſacramentally by Baptiſme. Profitable then no further, but as they were exerciſes to true repentance, and faith, that ſinners might learne to feare the wrath of God, and to ſéeke ſaluation in Chriſt, and Chriſt onely. Seuenthly, the burnt Offering was ſlaine, 
                           7. to fore ſhew the death of Chriſt. O fooles, and ſlowe of heart, ſaith our Sauiour, to beleeue all that the Prophets 
                           Luke 24. 25. 26. 27. 
                           haue ſpoken; Ought not Chriſt to haue ſuffered thoſe things, &amp; to enter into his glorie? And he began at Moſes &amp; all the Prophets, &amp; throughly interpreted vnto them. &amp;c. Now thinke with your ſelf, wherin, Moſes (that is, the Law) did ſo ſhew the death of Chriſt, as by theſe deathes and killings of the Sacrifices? But who offred the ſlaine ſacrifice? any but the Prieſt? No: that ſo it might be ſhadowed, how that there is no power in man to pleaſe God, but by the chiefe and high Prieſt Chriſt Jeſus, of whom the Leuiticall Prieſt was a type and a figure. Eightly, the Prieſts ſonnes offered the 
                           8. Verſe 5. 
                           blood, and ſprinkled it round about vpon the Altar, that is, by the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. The blood, noting the death of Chriſt, and the ſprinckling the preaching of it through the world. Ninthly, the

burnt Offering was flayed, and the ſkinne plucked off, then was it cut in peeces, verſ.
                            6. Hereby was noted the great and gréeuous bitterneſſe of Chriſt his Paſſion, who ſhould (for mās ſake) be ſtripped-out of all humane helpe, and made as bare and naked of all worldly glory, ſhew, credite, and eſtimation with men, as this Sacrifice was turned out of his ſkinne. Remember what you read in the Pſalme, ſpoken of Chriſt in the perſon of Dauid. I am a worme and no man; a ſhame of men, 
                           Pſal. 22. 6. 7. 
                           and the contempt of the people. All they that ſee mee, haue me in deriſion: they make a mowe, and nodde the head, ſaying, He truſted in the Lord, let him deliuer him, 
                           8. 
                           let him ſaue him, ſeeing he loueth him: And ſo foorth, as followeth in the Pſalme. Adde vnto it what you read in Eſay, He hath neither forme nor beautie: when wee 
                           Eſay 53. 2. 
                           ſhall ſee him, there ſhall be no forme that we ſhould deſire him. He is deſpiſed and reiected of men, &amp;c: we hid 
                           3. 
                           our faces from him, he was deſpiſed, and we eſteemed him not. Both which Prophecies are Expoſitions of this ſhadow, &amp; may truly tell vs, how his ſkinne was plucked of. An other vſe there might be to the partie that Offered the burnt Sacrifice, euen to teach him to pulloff his ſkinne, and to offer himſelfe vp to the Lord flayed, and without skinne, that is, without all counterfeit and bypocriticall ſhewes, without all earthly, vaine, and proud confidence in himſelf, or any workes or vertue, or worth whatſoeuer in him, but naked and bare to preſent himſelfe to his God, that is with a ſingle, a ſimple, a true, and a faithfull heart, boaſting of no deſert, but humbly crauing mercy and pardon, and life for the true Sacrifice ſake, Chriſt Ieſus, who in time ſhould come, &amp; ſo ſuffer for mans ſins, to ſet him frée. And ſurely thus ſtill muſt wée be flayed &amp; ſkinned in all our prayers, &amp; approachings to God, or elſe we ſhall deceiue our ſelues, &amp; be diſappointed of our deſire. The proud Phariſce in the Goſpell was not thus, but came Iohn 15.
                           
with his ſkinne on: and let his example teach vs. The poore Publican was flayed, and came with ſkinne off; let it comfort, and incourage vs. Tenthly, your Chapter 10 ſaith, And the ſonnes of Aaron the Prieſt, ſhall put 
                           Verſe 7. 
                           fire vpon the Altar, and lay the wood (in order) vpon the fire. Then the Prieſts, Aarons ſonnes, ſhall lay the parts 
                           8. 
                           (in order,) the head and the kall vpon the wood that is in the fire vpon the Altar. In that, body, and head, and all was laid in the fire, it might note how whole Chriſt ſhould ſuffer for vs; that is, Chriſt wholy, both in body and ſoule, for our bodies and ſoules that had ſinned; and ſo, you know, Chriſt did, verifying, and fulfilling the Figure. Againe, by the head, might be vnderſtood himſelfe; and by the parts, his Church and members; all in the fire &amp; all burnt together, that it might be ſhewed, the ſuffering of Chriſt to belong to his Choſen, both

                           in fruite, and ſenſe. The fruite is his taking away of their ſins. The ſenſe is their ſuffering alſo with him, &amp; for him, which is fit, when it ſhall be his bleſſed pleaſure, and alotted to vs but in mercie, that ſo ſuffering 
                           Rom. 8. 17. 2. Tim. 2. 10. Coloſs. 1. 24. 
                           with him, we might alſo reigne with him eternally in his Kingdome. The Diſciple is not greater than his Maſter, &amp;c. Matth.
                            10. 24. And Bleſſed is the man whom God correcteth, therefore refuſe not thou the chaſtiſing of the

                           temptation; for when he is tryed, hee ſhall receiue the crowne of Life, which the Lord hath promiſed to them that loue him. Thirdly, in the fire might be ſhadowed the power of the Spirit; and this Leſſon ſo learned, that as the fire gaue thoſe Legall Sacrifices their ſauour, &amp; was (as it were) the ſawce that made them taſte well: ſo is the Spirit, to all our duties, the means to ſeaſon them, and giue them liking with the Lord. Pray then without Spirit, and what is it? Heare the

Word preached without Spirit. and what doe you? Receiue the Sacrament without this working Spirit, and how can you doe well? Marke it therefore that all Sacrifices had either all, or part, burned with fire, &amp;c. We know not (ſaith the Apoſtle) what to pray as we 
                           Rom. 8. 26. 16. 
                           ought, but the Spirit helpeth our infirmities &amp;c. The Spirite beareth witneſſe to our ſpirit, that we are the children of God. If any man haue not the Spirit of Chriſt, the ſame 
                           9. 
                           is none of his. The Spirit is life for righteouſneſſe ſake. 
                           10. 11. 
                           The Spirit ſhal quicken your mortall bodies; and ſo foorth. This fire therefore the Lord euer vouchſafe vnto vs, and we ſhall doe well. Laſtly, when it is ſayd, the wood muſt be layd in order, the peeces in order, and all in order: well might they then, and we now obſerue and learne, how highly God is pleaſed with order, and how much he abhorreth confuſion. Wherefore the Apoſtle, giueth it for a Rule, Let all things be done decently, and in order. And the more we frame our ſelues vnto good order, the more aſſurance we euer haue, the Spirit gouerneth vs. But the Inwards &amp; the Legges thereof ſhall 
                           Verſe 5. 
                           ye waſh in water, ſayth your Chapter. The eleuenth Circumſtaunce in this kinde of Sacrifice, notably 11. ſhadowing, how Chriſt our Sauiour brought nothing impure or vncleane vnto his Paſſion. as all other men doe, when they ſuffer. For although they ſuffer willingly &amp; ioyfully, yet doe what they can, they ſhall euer finde a law in their members, rebelling againſt the law of 
                           Rom. 7. 23. 
                           their minde, and leading them captiue vnto the law of ſinne, which is in their members. No man therefore can offer a perfect offering to his God for his ſinnes. Onely Chriſt hath, whoſe Inwards and Legges were waſhed, that is, who wholly was pure and immaculate, within and without, &amp; euery way. This, This is my wel-beloued Sonne, in whom I (and in whom onely I) am well pleaſed. Laſtly, this burnt Offering, in this ſort vſed and offered, 12. was a ſweet ſauour vnto the Lord, ſayth the Text. Not

that God is delighted, as man, with any outward ſauour: but becauſe firſt, being done according to his preſcript, he accepted it, and liked it; and ſecondly, he ſaw in it his ſlaine Sonne, and ſmelled, as it were, his obedience, which though it was fulfilled in time, yet was with God from the beginning, as hee was alſo ſlaine from the beginning. Thus haue you viewed the Ceremonies of the firſt kinde of Burnt Sacrifices taken from the Herd. Conſider of them againe, and often; the Lord being intreated ſhal make them profitable to you.
                     
                     
                        The ſecond kinde of Burnt-offerings.
                        
                        
                           ANd if his Sacrifice for the Burnt-offering be of the 
                           Verſe 10. 
                           Flockes, (as of the Sheepe, or of the Goates,) he ſhall offer a Male without a blemiſh, &amp;c. The firſt kinde was of the Herde, as you haue ſéene; now the ſecond is of the Flockes, where againe you may note the Ceremonies before in the other kinde obſerued, and let that Expoſition ſerue here without any repetition againe of the ſame things. One thing here is, which was not before touched, namely, how they ſhall kill it on the 
                           Verſe 11. 
                           North-ſide of the Altar, not on any ſide indifferently, but on the North-ſide onely; which was done aſſuredly, to draw this his people from the idolatrie of the Gentiles, who worſhipped the Sunne in many places, and therefore euer in their ſeruices turned them towards the place where the Sunne was, as in the morning to the Eaſt, at mid-day to the South, at night to the Weſt. And matters of great moment they would referre to the iudgement of the Sunne. The Perſians in choiſe of a Iuſtine. King, agréed that all ſhould méete at a place on Horſebacke betimes, and whoſe Horſe firſt neighed before the riſing of the Sunne, he ſhould be King. For they tooke the Sun for a God, and Horſes with them were conſecrated to the Sunne, as things pleaſing to him.

In Tyrus, when ſeruants and ſlaues had cruelly ſlaine, by treachery and villanie, their Maſters and all Freemen, they forſooth would make a King of themſelues, and how? Euen thus, they would all aſſemble before the Sunne, and he that could firſt ſée the Sunne ariſe, he ſhould be King, as choſen out by that their God, the Sunne. Theſe toyes, leſt the Iſraelites ſhould learne of their neighbours the Heathens, God, not onely by words, &amp; expreſſe prohibitions, but alſo by ſuch ſignes Deus. 4. as this, would teach and inſtruct them. On the North-ſide therefore muſt this Burnt-offering be killed.
                        
                        2 This Ceremonie might admoniſh them, that the full Sunne, Chriſt Ieſus, was not yet riſen vnto them, but (in time) he ſhould come and ſhine in his ſtrength. For theſe Sacrifices and Legall Rites, were but as litle candels that gaue ſome ſmall light, and a farre more excellent Light ſhould they expect, that beléeued, in due time. And now, I pray you, hath it not appeared, and with his glory put out all theſe dimme Lights of the Law? We know it, and find it, with thankefulneſſe euer may we thinke of it. For he that reſerued vs for theſe times, and theſe times for vs, could haue made vs be borne, and to haue our being in the darkeſt times.
                        But now this Ceremonie of turning to the North is gone, and we may turne any way, and pleaſe God. The time is come, when the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip in Spirit, and trueth, euery where and euery way, lifting vp pure hands vnto God, Thus much would our old Fathers ſignifie by the placing of the vpper ende of our Churches Eaſt-ward, not North-ward, which they would not haue done, if they had thought this Ceremonie had bound men ſtill. Let vs then vſe things indifferent, indifferently, and not vnto any ſuperſtition, or ſinne.

                           Fowles, then he ſhall offer his Sacrifice of the Turtle-Doues, or of the yong Pigeons. Behold, the third ſort of burnt Offerings taken neither of the Herde nor of the Flocks, but of the Fowles, wherein firſt, the Lorde, (by varietie) did méete with the variable and mutable nature of man, and ſo kept that people from luſting after the faſhions of the wicked. Secondly, he mercifully regarded and prouided for the poore that ſhould not be able to offer the former ſorts, and ſo might haue béene diſcomforted with it. This appeareth Chap. 5. verſ. 7. 11. &amp; 14. 21. 22.
                        2 But of Fowles you ſée héere, not all ſorts might be offered, as Géeſe, Cockes, and vncleane Fowles whereof you read elſ-where, but Turtles and Pigeons. Which Fowles long before this time God appointed Abraham to offer, Gen. 15, (Happily) becauſe theſe moſt aptly figured Chriſt, In whom was all holy ſimplicitie, pacience, innocencie, &amp;c.
                        3 Concerning the Rytes, your Chapter ſpecifieth Verſe 15. them in this ſort. The Prieſt ſhall wring the necke of it a ſunder, (or, pinch it with his nayle,) ſo as not the head ſhould be quite plucked of, but wounded, that the blood might goe out, and the creature die. Thus was the Paſſion of Chriſt ſhadowed out, whoſe blood was ſhed, and he dyed, yet his head not plucked from his body. And his head not plucked from his body, to ſignifie he ſhould not be taken from his Church, which is his body, by any death, but raiſe himſelfe vp againe, and bée with his to the end of the world. Thus then the Elect of God comfort themſelues, both in aflictions of the world, and in death it ſelfe: that foraſmuch as their Head thus liueth, and neuer was, nor can

of from them, therefore as he hath ouercome, ſo ſhall they by him ouercome both the malice of the world, and the power of Satan, and enter into ioy with him for euermore.
                        4 The Maw and feathers were not offered, but caſtaway as vncleane, ſo ſtill noting that which I haue often noted, the puritie of ye Lord Ieſus, our true Sacrifice.
                        5 The Prieſt did cleaue it with his wings, but not deuide it in ſunder, againe to ſhadow, that though Chriſt dyed, yet hée was not quite extinguiſhed, but ſhould riſe againe, and liue. To which end alſo it was that not a bone of him was broken, as were theirs that dyed with him. That being alſo figured in the Paſchall Lambe.
                        
                        Laſtly, it is repeated here, for a ſweete fauour vnto the Lord, and not in vaine, but to the great comfort of all ſuch poore offerers. For thus are they aſſured, that albeit they were not of abilitie to offer vnto him Oxen, and Shéepe, or ſacrifices of great coſt, yet were they as déere to him, as thoſe that could ſo doe, and their Sacrifice of Turtles, or two Pigeons, yéelded as ſwéete a ſauour. O ſwéete ſtill! for this God is not changed, but the ſame for euer, and therefore ſtill euen two mites of a poore widow graciouſly accepted, ſtill a little ſpice, a little Goats-haire, or what my power is to bring vnto him, is accepted. So that I haue no cauſe to grieue at my pouertie, if my heart be ſound, and therefore looke vnto that, and be chéerefull in this.
                        Thus haue you viewed this Chapter. And now a little (with your ſelfe,) thinke of the maner of Reuelation then, and now. What a darke and dimme light (I ſay again) was that to this vouchſafed vnto vs now? Surely, ſo darke, as the Apoſtle feareth not to call that Night, and ours Day: ſaying, The night is gone, the day is come. God, for his Chriſt his ſake, make vs thankefull.
                        
                           
But now that theſe kindes of burnt Offerings and Sacrifices are gone, is there no ſort left vnto vs Chriſtians? yes indéede. Firſt, it is a Sacrifice to God 1 Holocauſtum Deo gratiſsimum praedicare Euangelium. moſt exceptable, To preach the Goſpell, and it is euen as that ſong which Dauid ſpeaketh of, pleaſing the Lord better than a yong Bullocke, that hath hornes &amp; hoofes. Thus S. Paul offered vp the Gentiles to God for a ſacrifice, winning thē by his Miniſtrie vnto the truth. Rom. 15. verſe 16. A Sacrifice ſo farre paſſing all others, as man paſſeth all brute beaſts. And the faithfull Preachers of the Goſpell dayly doe the like. Secondly, it 2 Praecipuum holocauſti genus. is a Chiefe kinde of burnt Offering for Chriſtians, To beléeue in Ieſus Chriſt by the Goſpell; becauſe he that beléeueth, offereth Chriſt dayly to God for his ſinnes, than the which nothing can be more pleaſing to Chriſt and his Father. Thinke of it early, and thinke of it late, when you are vpon your knées, deſiring mercie and pardon, fauour and comfort, both preſently and to death, yet laden and ouer-laden with a great burthen of gréeuous ſinnes, blemiſhes, and imperfections, hatefull to God, and hatefull to your ſelfe, through Grace giuen. What hope haue you to ſpéed and preuaile but by his Sacrifice? you will take Chriſt your déere Sauiour in the armes of your Faith, and ſay; holy Father, looke vpon him, not vpon me without him, (For then I dye in iuſtice:) but vpon me in him, and then ſhall I liue in mercie. Thus you offer Chriſt dayly, and it is the Chiefeſt Sacrifice ſtill of all beléeuers.
                        Thirdly, it is another kinde of burnt Sacrifice left 3 vs, To offer-vp our ſelues wholly to God, our ſelues, I ſay, our ſoules, and bodyes, a liuing, holy, and acceptable Sacrifice, enery member to doe his Will, and not ours. Of which S. Paul ſpeaketh to the Ro. Chap. 12. 1.
                        Fourthly, euery good worke commaunded of God, 4 and done of vs in Faith, is a pleaſing Sacrifice (in this ſort) to God. As Almes, Coloſſ. 4. To doe iuſtly, to

loue mercie, and to humble thy ſelfe, to walke with thy God. Mich. 6. verſ. 8. To offer ſpirituall Sacrifices, ſée S. Peter. Laſtly, all our aflictions paciently indured, 5 Pſal. 51. 17. according to the Pſalme, The Sacrifice of God is a troubled ſpirit, &amp;c. Doe therefore what God willeth, or ſuffer what he appointeth, as you are taught, and you offer Sacrifice dayly to God. Thus let this Chapter profit you.
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. II.
                     
                        FRom bloody Sacrifices now to Unbloody: and becauſe the Burnt-offering, deſcribed in the former Chapter could not bée without the Meat-offering, as you may ſée, Num. 15. 4. therefore, before he procéede to other kindes of Offerings, Moſes deſcribeth in this Chapter, the Meat-offering, laying downe thrée ſorts of it. The firſt, The Heads of the Chapter. 
                        Of raw Fleſh, verſ
                         1. to the 4. The ſecond, of Flowre not raw, but baked, fryed, ſodden; verſ.
                         4. to the 14. The third ſort, of Corne, not ground to Flowre; verſe 14, to the end. For the inſtitution of theſe Meat-offerings, it was not becauſe God hath néede of any meate or ſmelling ſauours, in the Pſalme he telling vs, that if he be 
                        Pſal. 50. 12. 
                        hungry he needes not ſhew vs, &amp;c. Neither yet that the déede done might merit, and turne away Gods anger: For, he that offereth an oblation, is as if he offered Swines blood, and he that remembreth incenſe, as if he bleſſed an Idoll, ſaith God by his Prophet; but by theſe the Lord Eſay 66. 3. would teach to his Church and children, good things concerning Chriſt their Sauiour, and his comming:

good Leſſons alſo for life and maners, as by particulars will appeare.
                     Firſt, This Meat-offering of Flowre and Corne might greatly comfort them touching their labours, and aſſure them, that yearly God would bleſſe their Corne, and their fields, becauſe it pleaſed him to be a partner with them in thoſe fruites.
                     2 The Meat-offering of fleſh, might draw their hearts to God in all times of their dyet, teaching them that God giueth, and God ſanctifieth, God proſpereth, and Oſe 2. 21. 22. is the ſtaffe both of bread and meat, They are not vpon our tables by chance, but by his kinde prouidence, and great goodneſſe; and therefore to forget him, were to become moſt vnworthy of thoſe bleſſings.
                     3 The Flowre muſt bee fine Flowre, to ſignifie ſtill vnto them the cleanneſſe and puritie of CHRIST, in whom there was no ſinne, neither any guile found in his mouth.
                         Of whom is all puritie in any of his members, our foulneſſe being waſhed by his blood. It taught alſo that our beſt things ſhould be giuen to God, and not our worſt, as our manner is.
                     4 The Meat-offering taught, that Chriſt is the remedie againſt all hunger. As, am I gréeued with ſin, and hunger for righteouſneſſe? Chriſt helpeth this hunger, being made righteouſneſſe, and wiſedome, and ſanctification 
                        1. Cor. 1. 30. 
                        and redemption vnto vs. Am I afraid to die, and hunger for comfort? Chriſt is my helpe for this hunger, and telleth me, that bleſſed are the dead which die 
                        Apoc. 14. 13. Iohn. 1. Cor. 54. 55. 57 
                        in him. He that beleeueth in him ſhall not die eternally. But though he be dead, yet ſhall he liue. Death is ſwallowed vp in victorie. O Death, where is thy ſting? O Graue, where is thy victorie? Thankes, Thankes be vnto God, which hath giuen vs Victorie through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
                        
                     
                     5 He ſhall powre Oyle vpon it, and put Incence thereon, 
                        Verſe 1. ſaith the Text; Oyle delighteth the taſte, and Incenſe
                        
the ſmelling. Neither of them careth God for, we know. But thus it pleaſed him to ſhadow-out vnto his people, that they ſhould euer ſerue him according to his owne preſciption, which is acceptable, as a good taſte or ſmell is, and not with the vnſauourie inuentions of their owne braine, as hatefull vnto him, as the other is pleaſing. Againe, the Oyle noted Chriſt his kindneſſe and mercie, which he ſhould euer ſhewe to poore penitent ſinners, wounded and ſmitten with woe for their manifold frailties and ſinnes. He ſhould not be rough vnto them, ſterne and cruell; but ſoft as Oyle, gracious and kinde, ſwéete and comfortable, ready to receiue them and pardon them. Learne of mee, I am meeke and lowly in heart, take my yoke vpon you, and 
                        Matth. 11. 29. 
                        you ſhall finde reſt vnto your ſoules. For my Yoke is eaſie, 
                        30. 
                        and my burden is light. Come vnto me all yee that are wearie and laden, and I will eaſe you. 
                        28.
                     
                     6 Incenſe againe figured out the prayers of Chriſt for his Church ſo powerfull with God his Father, that not onely he was heard himſelfe, but thereby he obteyned, that whatſoeuer we ſhould aske in his Name, and for him, we ſhould receiue alſo. The vaine vſe of Frankincenſe in Popiſh Churches, as an imitation of the Law, is ſtill to loue darkeneſſe, when God vouch ſafeth light, ſtill to continue aboliſhed Ceremonies, and ſtill to be ſtubborne againſt God, with a will-worſhip of our owne, neglecting his Will.
                     
                        And ſhall bring it vnto Aarons ſonnes the Prieſts; and

                        he ſhall take &amp;c. Whatſoeuer was offered to God muſt be giuen into the hand of the Prieſt, ſtill repreſenting vnto men this Doctrine; That onely by Chriſt there was acceſſe to God, and no way els. According to that plainer Reuelation in the Goſpel by himſelfe. No man commeth to the father but by me, I am the way; And, let vs therefore by him offer the Sacrifice of praiſe to God, &amp;c. Heb. 13. verſe 15.
                     
                        
2 A handfull of the Flowre, and of the Oyle, with all 
                        Verſe 2. 
                        the Incenſe, and the Prieſt ſhall burne it for a memoriall vpon the Altar, for it is an offering made by fire, for a ſweet ſauour vnto the Lord. Not all the Flowre, but a handfull; not all the Cakes, but one; &amp; not all was burned, but onely a little part of one: the reſt went to the Prieſts, and none could eate of it but the Prieſts. It was a Memoriall to them, to aſſure them, that God did reſpect the partie Offering, and would be mercifull vnto him. And becauſe it ſo pleaſed God it ſhould be, to him alſo it was a Memoriall, to extend his ſwéete goodneſſe to his penitent ſeruant.
                     3 This Meat-offering you ſée in your Chapter was either baked, verſ. 4. or fryed in the Frying-panne, verſ. 5. or ſodden in the Caldron, verſ.
                         7: And which way ſo-euer it was, thrée Rules were to be obſerued, ſpecified The firſt Rule. in the Text. Firſt, It muſt be without Leauen, verſ.
                         11. In the 7. Chapter, verſ. 13. and in the 22. Chap. verſe 20. You may read of a lawfull vſe of Leauen, but it was neuer lawfull (by the Law) to offer vnto GOD for a Sacrifice any Leauened bread, Leauen being a Figure both of corrupt Doctrine, and bad life. Beware of 
                        Matth. 16. 6. 11. 12. 
                        the Leauen of the Scribes and Phariſees, that is, of their corrupt Doctrine. Mat. 16. And let vs keepe the feaſt not with old Leauen, neither in the Leauen of maliciouſneſſe and wickedneſſe, but with the vnleauened bread of ſinceritie and truth. 1. Cor.
                         5. 8. Leauen noted bad life. Chriſt thē being ſhadowed in al theſe burnt Offerings, by this Rule of hauing no Leauen, they were taught the puritie of Chriſt his Doctrine, and the holineſſe of his life. His Doctrine ſo pure, that it maketh others pure. Ye are cleane through the Word which I haue ſpoken 
                        Iohn. 15. 3. Iohn 8. 51. 
                        vnto you. And, Verily, verily, I ſay vnto you, if any man keepe my Word, he ſhall not ſee death. Then you ſée it maketh cleane. His life alſo ſo pure, that not onely his falſe accuſers could faſten no fault vpon him; but

by his innocencie he appeaſed Gods wrath for our impuritie. Againe, it taught the Church in that Legall faſhion by darke figure, that after Chriſt his example they ought alſo to be frée from both theſe; to wit, falſe doctrine, and ill manes. Not teaching (if they be Teachers,) any corrupt matter, not beléeuing and holding (if they be no Teachers) and abſurd vntrueths. Neither Teachers nor People leading a wicked life, but in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, as the Lord ſhall inable, ſpending all their dayes. The ſecond Rule is, That 
                        The ſecond Rule. 
                        there he no hony in his Meat-offering made by fire vnto the Lord. Of Hony, we read many things; as, that the nature of it is to preſerue bodyes, not ſuffering them to rot and putrifie: That many (by the vſe of it) liue vnto a great age, as namely, in the Ile of Corſica, by Plinies Teſtemonie, who calleth them long-liuers, onely by the dayly vſe of Hony. Hony hath a ſwéete and pleaſing taſte, not ſharpe. Whereupon Salomon ſaith, Faire words are as a hony combe, ſweetnes to the ſoule, 
                        Prou. 16. 24. 
                        and health to the bones. My Sonne, eate Hony, for it is 
                        Prou. 24. 13. 
                        good; and the hony-combe, for it is ſweet vnto the mouth. What might be the reaſon then, that God did forbid any hony to be vſed in this Offering? Anſwere is made, that hony, although it be ſwéet in taſte, yet it is bitter by effect. For it greatly increaſeth, choler, which is as bitter, as the hony is ſwéet. Secondly, although hony be good to eate, yet a man may eate too much of it. Prou. 25. 26. Thirdly, euen in taſte it will not ſéeme ſwéete (if you eate much) but very bitter or ſowre. Laſtly, it hath the very nature of Leauen, béeing boyled, Mel coctum, vt ſtatim acorem contra
                           
                              •
                           at, panem fermentat. Caluin.
                         and ſo hauing gotten a little ſharpeneſſe. Nowe, foraſmuch as none of theſe things are in Chriſt, who was ſhadowed by this Sacrifice, therefore is hony forbidden to be vſed in it, as you read here in your Chapter aſwell as Leauen, verſ.
                         11. Firſt, in Chriſt there is no ſuch ſwéetneſſe as ingendreth bitterneſſe, or any

euill to the true Cater of him by Faith. Secondly, Chriſt cannot be receiued or eaten too much, but the more we féede on him, the better. Thirdly, Chriſt is not ſwéet at the beginning, and bitter at the ende; but contrariwiſe, bitter at firſt, and ſwéet at the ende. He that forſaketh not all, and followeth me, cannot bee my Diſciple: How bitter is this at the firſt, but in the end how ſwéete? You ſhall ſit vpon twelue Seates, and iudge the twelue Tribes of Iſrael: You ſhall eate of my Table, &amp;c. Laſtly, Chriſt puffeth no man vp, as Leauen doth the Dough, neither ſowreth his ſeruant in whom he dwelleth; but he maketh him lowly and humble, and ſwéete in behauiour to his brethren poore and gréeued, and néeding comfort. Melancton (not vnprofitably) ſaith, Hony was forbidden alſo to be offered to God, to teach that 1. Cor. 2. the Word &amp; Doctrine of God, is not to be turned to popular applauſe, not to content the Prince, and to pleaſe the people, contrary to the Truth and edge of it: Art may not drawe his Diuine precepts, to make them delight humane Reaſon; but his Word muſt be left to his right Nature, pleaſe it, or diſpleaſe it the Hearers. For ſuch Hony-offerers are but dawbers, and ſowers of pillowes vnder mens elbowes, flatterers, &amp; time-ſeruers, hatefull to God, and hurtfull to his people. Others haue noted, that if hony be burned, it ſmelleth not well: and therefore was forbidden to be vſed in the Sacrifice ſhadowing Chriſts death, as this Sacrifice by fire did: becauſe his death ſmelleth moſt ſwéetly, and right deere vnto God alſo is the death of his Saintes for him. The Gentiles, againe vſed to offer hony in their Cakes, to their Gods, as we read: and therefore (happily) God alſo forbad it.
                     The third Rule you haue in the 13. verſe: All the 
                        The 3. Rule. Verſe. 13. 
                        Meat-offering ſhalt thou ſeaſon with ſalt, neither ſhalt thou ſuffer the ſalt of the Couenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat-offering, but vpon all thy Oblations,

thou ſhalt offer ſalt. Firſt, it is called, the ſalt of the Couenant of God, becauſe God required it in all theſe Sacrifices as a Couenant, and thing agréed vpon firme and ſtable, not to be broken, which kinde of Couenants were called Couenants of ſalt. Num. 18. 19. 2 Chro.
                         13. 5. Secondly, the Commandement is generall. All the Meat-offerings, whereupon our Sauiour Chriſt taketh occaſion to exhort, that all men would addreſſe themſelues vnto the perpetuall &amp; faul
                           •
                        les kéeping of Gods holy Couenant, by the example of theſe Offerings, which (without ſalt) were no way acceptable nor tollerable. To the continuall kéeping I ſay, becauſe the Text ſayth. Thou ſhalt not ſuffer the ſalt of the Couenant 
                        Chap. 2. 13. 
                        of thy God to bee lacking from thy Meat-offering. which is, as if he had ſaid, euer haue in thy ſelfe the Word and Law of thy God, with which thou art ſeaſoned as with ſalt, the Offerings of ſtrangers from Gods Couenant being neuer acceptable, but an abhomination to God. For the true ſeaſoning, which findeth grace Tranſlata locutio a ſenſibus ad animum. Tremel.
                         with God, is no where found but in the Word, and therefore all worſhips deuiſed by man (ſéeme they neuer ſo wittie, and gay in the eyes of the Inuenters (are vnſauorie and odious. Others looking at Chriſt his alluding to this place in the 9. of Marke aboueſaid, gathered thus of it: that Chriſt from this Ceremonie draweth his exhortation to his faithfull, that they patiently indure to be purged and purified, if they deſire euer to be acceptable to God. For euery Sacrifice ſaith he, muſt be ſalted with ſalt, and euery man ſhall be ſalted 
                        Mar. 9. 49. 
                        with fire: that is, our corrupt affections, by the Word and the Croſſe, as by a holy fire, clenſed and cléered from that diſpleaſing ſauour they yéelde, and we wholly ſeaſoned vnto God, as this mortalitie will giue vs leaue. If you thinke farther of ſalt thus preferred before Leauen and hony, you ſhall ſée that ſalt is moſt commodious for mans vſe. For ſalt kéepeth our meate from putrifaction,

it kéepeth wine from ſowring, it preſerueth dead bodyes a long time ſwéet and ſauourie, it yéeldeth our meate a good taſte, and dryeth vp the ſuperfluous moiſture of it in our bodyes, which might bréed diſeaſes: and (in a word) ſo good it is, that the Prouerbe ioyneth it with the Sunne, without which we cannot liue, ſaying: Sale &amp; Sole nihil viilius: Than Salt and the Sunne nothing is more profitable. Wittie and ſharpe
                         
                        Sales. 
                        pleaſant ſpeeches haue their name of ſalt, and hée that hath no wit, is ſaid to haue no ſalt in him. Salt then was Non habet ſalom. required in the Sacrifice to figure out Chriſt, who indéed is the true ſalt, that ſeaſoneth vs &amp; all our works, or elſe neither we nor they pleaſe God. Sinne hath made vs vnſauourie to God; and, till this ſalt be ſprinkled ouer vs, we haue no acceſſe to him, nor fauour with him, but when once we are ſeaſoned with Chriſt, Then he that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of mine Eye. And as our perſons, ſo our workes then pleaſe him, before béeing foule, and as a ſtayned cloath. So that now it is ſaid, He that beleeueth in me ſhall not periſh, but haue eternall life. To Chriſt we are begotten by the Miniſtrie of the Word, and therefore the Apoſtles were called ſalt, and the Miniſters of GOD, ſtill are the ſalt of the earth. For as ſalt lighteth vpon the fleſh, and byteth and dryeth vp corrupt moyſtore, pre
                           •
                        eruing and kéeping ſwéet the ſame: euen ſo the Miniſters by their labours conſume and dry vp the errors, the luſtes, the pride, the vaine-glorie, the couetous affections and whatſoeuer maketh vnſauourie, preſeruing body and ſoule ſwéete vnto God in Chriſt, and frée from eternall corruption.
                     
                        If thou offer a Meat-offering of thy firſt fruites vnto the 
                        Verſe. 14. 
                        Lord, thou ſhalt offer eares of Corne dried by the fire, and wheat beaten out of the greene eares, &amp;c. It was ſayd in the beginning, that theſe Meat-offerings were here layd downe in three kindes: The firſt, raw fleſh; the ſecond,

                        flowre not raw, but either baked, fryed, or ſodden; the third, Corne not ground to flowre. The two firſt kindes you haue ſéene with their Ceremonies; and now followeth this third kinde. You may here remember the many ſorts of Offerings of firſt-Fruites mentioned in the Scriptures, whereof this is but one. In Deutro. you read of firſt-Fruites, but in a basket, and carried to

Laſtly, this kinde here noted of Eares of Corne dryed by the fire, &amp;c. By this diuerſitie wée may well note, (and ſincke it déepe into our hearts) what a reckoning God maketh of Thankfulneſſe in man, for the benefits and mercies he receiueth at Gods hands; and how odious it is to him, and dangerous to man, when it is otherwiſe. And by this ſort we may ſtill ſée Chriſt figured, and taught: wherevpon Chriſt compareth himſelfe to Corne, which except it fall into the ground and dye, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much

                     2 The remainder (a memoriall being burned to God) did remaine to the Prieſts: ſo ſhadowing out, that Chriſt ſhould not obtaine Heauen for himſelfe, but for his Church, which was repreſented in the Prieſt, all being a royall Prieſt-hood. Againe, it taught how carefull God would haue his ſeruants for the maintenance of the Miniſtrie, when they ſée him ſo carefull of them, and for them. From which care how farre they are that ſpoyle them, and all manner of wayes abuſ

                        THE Burnt-offering and the Meat-offering thus paſſed ouer, this Chapter returning againe to the Sacrifices of liuing creatures, ſpeaketh of The Heads of the Chapter. the Peace-offering, that is, a Sacrfice of thankſgiuing, offered for peace and proſperitie, either generally, or particularly. For who, ſayth Iob, hath beene fierce againſt him,
                         
                        Iob. 9. 4. 
                        and hath proſpered? He remoueth the Mountaines and they feele not when he ouer-throweth them in his wrath. He remoueth the Earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof do ſhake, &amp;c. That men therefore might know their peace and ſafetie both of their perſons and goods, to procéede only from this Almightie GOD, therefore would he haue a ſet kinde of Sacrifice to be offered of them for the ſame, and called a Peace-offering. This kinde of Sacrifice hath ſomething like, and ſomething vnlike to the Burnt-offering, deſcribed in the firſt Chapter. Like were theſe, It was brought to the doore of the Tabernacle as that was: the Offerers hand layd vpon the head, killed, and the blood ſprinckled about the Altar, as there &amp;c. Vnlike were theſe: In that, onely a Male might be offered: in this, either Male, or female: in that, the whole was burnt; in this, onely a part: namely, the fat, and as you ſée verſ. 4. &amp;c, in that, no part went to any man but the skinne, this was deuided into

3. parts, one to the Lord, one to the Prieſt, and one to the Offerer, as you ſee in the 7. Chapter of this Booke, and Deut. 18. in that, foules might bee offered; in this, not, &amp;c. Of the former nothing néeds to be ſayd againe, becauſe in the firſt Chapter they were ſufficiently opened, but of the latter a little.
                     1 Firſt then, what might it meane, that in the Burnt-Offering, onely a Male might be offered, and in this Peace-offering, both Male and Female? Anſwere may be made, that firſt the Lord in this would drawe the Iſraelites from the manner and faſhion of the idolatrous Egyptians, who in their Sacrifices (as Herodotus noteth) vſed to offer no Female. And ſecondly, hée would herein yéeld a comfort to all women, that for them Chriſt ſhould die aſwell as for men, and they ſhould be heires of his Kingdome (by Faith in Chriſt) aſwell as men. For there is neither Iewe, nor Graecian (ſaith the Apoſtle) there is neither bound nor free, there

                        is neither Male nor Female, but we are all one in Chriſt Ieſus.
                         And ye husbands, ſaith S. Peter, dwell with your wiues as men of knowledge, giuing honour vnto the women, as vnto the weaker veſſell, (Now marke) euen as they which are heires together of the grace of Life, that your prayers be not interrupted. A ſwéet Sauiour then is the Lord Ieſus, you ſée, to women aſwell as to men, if they haue grace to beléeue; and in token here of GOD would haue the Female offered, aſwell as the Male. It was a bleſſed Woman that ſayd, My ſpirit reioyceth in God my Sauiour: And ſo may euery true-beléeuing woman ſay with comfort.
                     2 In the Offering of the fat that couereth the Inwards and all the far that is vpon the Inwards &amp;c. verſ.
                         3. 4. Some haue iudged the delights and pleaſures of the fleſh to be ſhadowed, which of a true childe of God are to be killed and ſlaine as Sacrifices were, and mortified. Others, looking at the phraſe of the Scripture,

which vſually noteth by the word (fat) the beſt things, haue thought, that herein was figured &amp; taught, how men ought to offer to God euer of their beſt, and not, as we now a dayes doe, of our worſt. For the phraſe, you haue it often in Scripture, as when God ſaith. All the fat of the Oyle, &amp; all the fat of the wine haue I giuen thee: that is, the chiefeſt, or the beſt. Numb. 18. In the Numb. 18. 12 Pſal. 81. 16. Pſalme, God would haue fed them with the fat of the Wheat; your vulgar Tranſlation expreſſeth what that is, euen with the fineſt Wheat-flower. In another Pſal. 63. 6. Pſalme, My ſoule ſhall be ſatified as it were with marow and fatneſſe. That is, euen (as it were) with the beſt things, and ſo in many places more. For the matter, who in right ſhould haue the beſt, if God ſhould not? of whom we haue the beſt, and all whatſoeuer we haue. Thinke then of this many wayes by your ſelfe, andaamend what is amiſſe. In your Tythes and Duties do you giue the beſt? Do you offer the fat? No, no, your conſcience accuſeth you fearefully (I feare) in this behalfe. He that ſweareth &amp; ſwaggereth all his youth, and intendeth to offer vnto God his old age, when for debilitie of body he can doe no more harme, doth he offer to GOD the fat, or the leane? the beſt, or the worſt? He that hath many ſonnes, and can indure none to ſerue God in his Temple but onely one that is lame and full of imperfections, doth hée offer willingly the fat vnto his God, Who gaue him all theſe branches of his body, and muſt giue him comfort of them, or elſe he ſhall neuer haue any, but vnſpeakable woe and griefe in ſtéed of it? Thus may you go further in this Meditation, and be the better by it in many particulars. Againe, becauſe this fat appoynted to be offered was an inward thing, and not an outward. Others haue thought, that thereby was figured, how carefull we muſt euer be to offer vnto God our inwards, without which no eternall dutie can or will pleaſe God. Hypocrites are full of out-ward holineſſe,

                        make cleane diligently the out-ſide of the platter: but God abhorreth them and their painted ſhewes. The true worſhippers of God take an other courſe, and looke that all be well within. The Lord (ſaith Dauid) loueth truth in the inward parts, and his Sacrifice is a troubled ſpirit, a broken and a contrite heart within, not a pale face, a downe looke, many out-ward ſighes that are heard of men, vaine faſting from fleſh, and ſurfeting vpon Fiſh, &amp;c. Enter into thy Chamber and ſhut the doore to thee, and thy Father which ſeeth in ſecret ſhall reward thee openly. Still, ſtill, offer to God thy in-wards. Moſes
                         prayed within, Anna
                         prayed within, 
                        Exod. 14. 15. 1. Sam. 1. 13. that her chéeke quiuered with the vehemencie of her ſpirit, &amp;c.
                     3 (In that, part of the Sacrifice went alſo to the partie that offred it) plainly was figured, that Chriſt ſhould die for all, and Lay-men (as wée ſpeake) ſhould haue their portion in him, aſwell as the Clergie; the Hearers as well as the Preacher; the people as well as the Miniſter be bleſſed in him, if God vouchſafe Faith. So men, ſo women, ſo learned and vnlearned, and All take hold, and hold faſt; He is All-ſufficient for vs all, to bring vs to the Kingdome of his Father, without vaine ſupplies of ſinfull Idolaters, and he belongeth to vs all, if we be not in fault our ſelues. This I ſay againe, might be learned by the allowance of part of the Sacrifice to them that offered it, of what degrée and calling ſoeuer they were.
                     4 You may here obſerue how they were forbidden Verſ. 17. 
                        to eate either fat, or blood. The Lords prohibition of fat, might teach them to like and vſe a modeſt, moderate, and fiting diet, which as it is good for the body, ſo alſo hath it profite for the ſoule. Hee that loueth Wine

                         And, Beware of ſurfeting and drunkenneſſe, of exceſſe and belly chere often ſaith the Scripture, inregard of the ſoule.

                        double conqueſt to conquerthy ſelfe: And It is a double deſtruction to deſtroy thy ſelfe, Iohns meat was Locuſts and wilde hony, a moderate diet. The companion of Gluttonie is rottenneſſe, and the follower of drunkenneſſe is forgetfulneſſe and ſottiſhneſſe. Gods people are here forbidden to eate their fat, and thinke euer on the meaning. Blood alſo was forbidden to them, that ſo they might learne to take héed of crueltie, and to taſte of mercie and louing kindneſſe, in all their actions and behauiour. God is mercifull, and we muſt follow him. Satan and his members are bloody and cruell, we muſt auoyd it. Mercie and Crueltie are two large matters, you may your ſelfe (as you like) follow the Meditation Leuit. 17. 10. farre. Whoſoeuer (ſayth the Lord) he be of the houſe of Iſrael, or of the ſtrangers that ſoiourne among them, that eateth any blood, I will euen ſet my face againſt that perſon that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people, &amp;c.
                     
                     Thus had this people their Peace-offerings, that is, duties of Thankefulneſſe to their God, for their peace and proſperitie vouchſafed vnto them. And moſt fit it was, that he ſhould often be thanked for ſuch fauours. The like mercies and goodneſſe remaine to vs at this day; &amp; are we either fréed from the dutie, or left without meanes to performe it? No, no; but as they had Oxen and Kine, and Shéepe and Goates then appointed and allowed; ſo haue we the Calues of our lips, and the Sacrifice of Thankſgiuing ſtill remaining for vs, and as ſtrictly required of vs, as theſe (in thoſe dayes) were of them. Offer them vp then with a frée heart, and with a féeling ſoule. Our Peace is great, our proſpeperitie comfortable, our GOD moſt ſwée and kinde, and ſhall we not offer? The publike is ſwéete, the priuate

is ſwéet, and forget you to offer? We lay vs downe and take our reſt, and this our God maketh vs dwell in ſafetie, O where is your Offering? We riſe againe and goe to our labour, and a Dogge is not heard to mooue his tongue among vs: Owe we no Offering? O Lord, O Lord, make vs thankfull to Thee for theſe mercies; The whole ſtate we liue in, for the cōmon, and our ſeuerall ſoules, for ſeuerall mercies now many yeares inioyed. O touch vs, O turne vs from our fearefull dulneſſe, and abuſing of this ſo ſwéet, ſo long, and ſo happie Peace. Continue thy ſacred Seruant, the chiefeſt meanes vnder Thee of this our comfort, and euer ſtill furniſh him with wiſe helpes, truely fearing Thee, and truely louing him. Let our heads goe to the graue in this peace, if it may be thy bleſſed pleaſure, and our eyes neuer ſée the change of ſo happie an Eſtate. Make vs thankfull and full of Peace-offerings, be Thou ſtill ours, and euer mercifull,
                     Amen, Amen.

                           MOſes hauing ſpoken of ſuch Sacrifices and Oblations, as were Exerciſes of pietie and gratitude to God; now beginneth to adde ſuch as were Expiatorie, and did reconcile men vnto God, aboliſhing their guiltineſſe and ſinne: yet, not by the vertue of the thing, but by Faith in Chriſt promiſed and ſhadowed by the Sacrifice, Heb.
                         10. In this Chapter he ſpeaketh of the Sinne-offering, that The Heads of the Chapter. Galat. 6. 1. is, of a kinde of Sacrifice ordained to be offered for ſinnes committed of error, ſuch as S. Paul noteth, when he faith, Brethren, if any man be ſuddenly taken in any offence, Ye which are ſpiritual, reſtore ſuch a one with the ſpirit of

meekeneſſe, conſidering thy ſelfe, leſt thou be alſo tempted. For there be other ſinnes of errour, which are not here meant, which Dauids diſtinction of ſinnes in his Pſalme may teach you: whereby he maketh a difference betwixt his Secret ſinnes, (O Lord, clenſe me from my 
                        Pſal. 19. 12. 13. 
                        ſeciet faults) and preſumtuous ſinnes, (O Lord, keepe thy Seruant from preſumtuous ſinnes, leſt they get the dominion ouer me.) The ſinnes therefore of error, here meant, are ſuch, as haue in them no wicked pride againſt God, but of méere weakneſſe are committed, whilſt the infirmitie of the fleſh choaketh reaſon and iudgement, that the offender is for the time blinde, and ſéeth not his fault. The Kites and Ceremonies of this Sacrifice differeth according to the qualitie of the perſon for whom it was. The manner was diuers, the matter was diuers. If it were the High-Prieſt, then thus; If the Prince, then ſo; If a priuate-man, then after 
                        Aliter. 
                        another faſhion; as your Chapter ſheweth. The matter alſo was one, If rich men offered; an other, If Aliud. poore men; and a third ſort, if men of the middle-ſort; that is, neither rich nor poore, but well offered. Wherein, that ſtill ſtill the Lord pleaſed to reſpect the poore, and to fit his Sacrfice to their abilitie, what a comfort containeth it, if it be well marked? Shall any worldly want breake thy heart, when to thy GOD thou art ſo déere euen in that want, &amp; with that want? No, no, be of good comfort, and let this world be as God pleaſeth, the next world is thine, where is true and during-comfort. This was felt of Dauid as ſwéete, when he preferreth the light of Gods countenance vpon him, before wine and 
                        Pſal. 4. 6, 7. 
                        oyle and worldly wealth whatſoeuer. And yet (euen here) the Lord will neuer leaue you without his merrie, as ſhall be fit, whoſe prouidence feedeth the young Rauens.
                     
                     2 Conſider the ende of this kinde of Sacrifice. It was not inſtituted to abrogate Ciuill puniſhments

which according to the Law were to be inflicted vpon offenders, as Theeues, Murtherers, and ſo foorth: but it was ordained (as hath béene ſaid) for the expiation of thoſe faults which ignorantly (as not thinking of the 
                        Per incogitantiam. 
                        matter) were committed againſt the Ceremoniall Law chiefly, and for which there was no other puniſhment layd downe either Ciuill or Criminall. Neither was this expiation other, you muſt euer remember, than as Faith truly tooke hold of Chriſt figured by the Sacrifice. For, it ſtandeth firme, that it is impoſſible for the blood of Bulles and Goates to take away ſinnes: Heb.
                         10. 4. But Chriſt with his owne Offering hath conſecrated for euer them that are ſanctified: verſ. 14. Sée alſo Rom. 8. 3. 2. Cor. 5. 21. Heb. 13. 11. &amp;c.
                     
                     3 The firſt perſon that is named is the Prieſt, that is, Verſe 3. the High-Prieſt, that is anointed, who, ſaith your Chapter, If he doe ſinne (according to the ſinne of the people) then ſhall he offer for his ſinne which hee hath ſinned, a young Bullocke without blemiſh (for a ſinne-offering) vnto the Lord, &amp;c. By which you may profite thus; When you read that the High-Prieſt had need alſo ſome times to offer for his negligences and ignorances, you ſée how plainly it was taught to that people, that the High-Prieſt, was not the true High-Prieſt
                         which ſhould make perfect and ſound ſatiſfaction and attonement to God, but another was to be expected, of whom that was but a Figure and ſhadow, to wit, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt
                         the Sonne of GOD,
                         promiſed in the Scriptures. Then for the Ceremonies vſed: The bringing of him to the 
                        Verſe 4. 
                        doore of the Tabernacle, The laying his hand on his head, The killing of him, &amp;c, haue béene expounded before. But where mention is made of The blood brought 
                        Verſ. 5. 
                        into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, you may remember, that there were two ſorts of theſe Offerings for ſinne. One, whereof the blood was thus brought in, and of theſe the Prieſt might eate no part, but the fleſh,

the Skinne, the head, &amp;c, were burned without the Hoſte, 
                        Heb. 13. 11. Leuit 6.

                           7. Verſ. 6. 
                        verſ. 11. An other,
                         whereof the blood was not brought in, and the fleſh of ſuch the Prieſt might eate, Chap. 6. of this Booke and 10. The ſprinkling of the blood ſeuen times, ſignified that the ſatiſfaction and expiation for, and of ſinne made once by Chriſt, endured good for euer in all ages and times, and néeded not to bée iterated; The number of ſeuen repreſenting the whole time of this worlds continuance. Others, by this ſeuen-foldſprinckling, haue thought, that the grieuouſnes of ſinne was ſhadowed and noted. For (ſay they) it is written, He that ſlayeth Cain ſhall be puniſhed ſeuen-fold; that is, Gen. 4. 15. 24. grieuouſly. And againe, If Cain be auenged ſeuen-fold, truely Lamech ſeuentie-times ſeuen-fold: that is, more grieuouſly a great deale. Wherefore, this ſeuen-times ſprinkling of the blood, might note, that euery ſinne (with God) deſerueth ſeuen puniſhments, that is, ſharpe and great puniſhment, if he ſhould deale with vs in Juſtice, and not in mercie.
                     4 The blood was put vpon the hornes of the Altar of 
                        Verſe 7. &amp;c. 
                        ſweet incenſe, to ſignifie, that no prayer can perce vnto God, but in and by the blood of Chriſt. All the reſt of the blood was powred at the foote of the Altar of burnt Offering, to note ſtill the true ſhedding of CHRISTS blood for mankinde, and becauſe alſo it was holy, it might not bée caſt out as prophane. The burning of the body without the hoſte, plainly ſhewed that Chriſt ſhould not ſuffer in Hieruſalem, but ſhould be led out of the Citie to a place appointed, and there ſuffer: which you know was fulfilled accordingly. Heb. 13. 11. 12. And, the whole Bullocke was to be burned, being a ſinne offering, to teach men to burne all their ſinnes, and not to diuide them (as we do) when we ſay, I will amend my drunkennes, but I cannot leaue my ſwearing; or, if I leaue that alſo, yet my licencious life a litle more muſt haue a ſwinge, &amp;c. But burne all, thou

were beſt, and willingly kéepe none, burne them (I ſay) by true ſorrow and deteſtation of them, euen All, All, leſt but one (béeing wilfully ſtill delighted in) burne thée all and wholy in Hell for euer. When Moſes with the Iſraelites was to depart out of Egypt, and Pharaoh would haue had them leaue their cattell behind them, ſauing what they intended to ſacrifice: Anſwere was made, they would not leaue one hoofe of Exod. 10. 26. a beaſt behinde: and ſo deale you with your ſinnes, leaue not one hoofe of ſinne behinde, No one ſinne, no part of ſinne, that is (ſtill I ſay) by wittingly, willingly, and boldly continuing in it, and delighting in it: Otherwiſe, frée from ſinne in this life we cannot be. But (through the grace of GOD) we may be frée from preſumtuous pleaſure in ſinne, and ſigh and grone more and more, for that any way we ſhould offend ſo good a God, as we finde infinite wayes of him that we do offend, deſiring and longing to be frée euen from all ſinne.
                     5 In that there is more ſolemnitie about the Sinne-offering of the Prieſt, than of a priuate-man; you may firſt ſée the care of God, to ſet out to his Church the Dignitie of his Calling, which euer with him was great, and for him, with all that truely reuerenced and feared his name. Secondly, you may thinke of the greatneſſe of ſinne in ſuch a One. For, the more is required to the expiation of it, the greater is euer the ſinne. The like may be ſaid of Princes faults, and great mens. Alſo, by the heauy puniſhment which God Verſe 22. 1. Sam. 4.

King Saul for ſacrificing againſt the Law, how ſharply puniſhed? Dauids adulterie and murther, O how fearefully puniſhed? Horribly and ſuddenly will God appeare to the great Officers of his kingdome.

                        Verſe 13. 
                        ſhould ſinne through ignorance, yet a ſinne-offering muſt be offered by them all, and their number yéeldeth no excuſe. Great was the number of ſinners, when God ſent the Flood, but their number defended them Gen 6. not. So in Sodom and Gomorrha the offenders were Gen, 19. many. Ten Tribes of twelue fell away from GOD and became Idolaters. Broad is the way that leadeth to Hell, and many finde it, going to Hell, though they be many, &amp;c. Secondly, obſerue with your ſelfe the phraſe (hid from your eyes) and ſée the ſtate of many a man and woman doing euill. The matter is hid from their eyes in Gods anger, and albeit they lie at the pits brinke of damnation and deſtruction, yet they ſée it not, féele it not, are not troubled with it. Becauſe (indéed) they neuer ſit and take an account of themſelues and their workes, laying them to the Rule of the Word: which if they did, conſcience would quickly bite and ſpie, and ſpeake of a miſdoing. The Godly doe this at laſt, and therefore you ſée héere in your Chapter, a time of knowing to them, as there was a time of hiding. Pray we euer for this grace, that we ſleepe not in death: I meane in ſinne that leadeth to death, but that we may awake

                     CHAP. V.
                     
                        BEfore Moſes will procéede to ſhew what poore people ſhould offer for their ſinne, in this Chapter he layeth downe certaine kindes of ſinne for which they muſt offer, and by which The Heads of the Chapter. they may learne to iudge of other the like offences. And, the firſt is an Example of the Iudiciall Law, in the firſt verſ. The plaine meaning whereof Verſ. 1. is, if any ſhall heare one ſweare that either he hath not had, or hath not done, what he (vpon his owne knowledge) vnderſtandeth he hath had, and hath done, if he teſtifie not what he knoweth, and reueale not the iniquitie of the other that hath ſo falſly ſworne, he ſhall be guiltie of his ſinne. Where you ſée and ought euer to remember, that not onely he taketh the Name of God in vaine, which ſweareth falſly; but euen he alſo that winketh at the ſame falſe oath, béeing able to reprooue him, and zealouſly doth not his endeuour to haue that abuſe of Gods Name puniſhed by reuealing and making it knowen. A Law that toucheth vs néerely, as

the world goeth now, men wholy preferring many Vſitatum humani generis vitium eſt, peccatum latendo committere, negando defendere, &amp; defendendo multiplicare. Greg.
                         times their affection to their friends before all the glorie of God in this behalfe.
                     2 The ſecond example is of the Law Ceremoniall in the 2. verſ. As if he ſhould haue ſaid, whenſoeuer any perſon becommeth vncleane by touching of ſuch things as make him vncleane, and careleſly neglecting (according to Rites of the Law) to purge himſelfe from that vncleanneſſe, eate of the ſanctified Sacrifices, aſſoone as that his ſinne ſhall be knowne vnto him, he muſt offer the Offering here preſcribed &amp;c. The true drift of which Law was to draw men to the carefull &amp; diligent conſideration of their impuritie, and to the knowledge of their ſinne. Read ouer the firſt of Eſay, and ſée how the Lord abhorreth all Sacrifices and ſeruices whatſo-euer, when men ſée not their ſinne, but runne on with their offences, and yet thinke to pleaſe God with out-ward Religion. No, no, ſaith God there, that will not be. But waſh you, make you cleane, take away the euill of your workes from before mine eyes, ceaſe to doe euill, learne to doe well, ſeeke iudgement, releiue the oppreſſed, iudge the fatherleſſe, and defend the widow, and then the caſe ſhall be altered, &amp;c. Then, though your ſinnes were as Crimſin, they ſhall bee made as white as ſnow, and though they were red as Skarlet, they ſhall be as wooll. If you conſent and obey, ye ſhall eate the good things of the land: but, if ye refuſe and be rebellious, ye ſhall be deuoured with the ſword, for the mouth of the the Lord hath ſpoken it. Thus ſéeketh the Lord to haue vs know ſinne, and flye ſinne. And marke it againe in the Text, verſ. 2. (And is not ware of it) making to your ſelfe this good vſe of it: That we are not euer cleane, when we ſée not any vncleanneſſe; for our fault may be hid from vs, and we not ware of it, and therefore Dauid prayeth for his ſecret ſinnes. But ſtill it remaineth an vncleanneſſe, though we be blinde, and it will beſtroy

vs, if we ſée it not in time. Wherefore pray for eyes and the Lord ſhall giue them; pray for a heart of fleſh, and the Lord ſhall giue it. If thou ſee thy ſinne, 
                        Si tu peccata videris, Dominus obliuiſcetur; ſi tu neglexe
                              •
                            is ea videre, Dominus memor erit eorum. 
                        God ſhall not ſee it, and if thou ſee not, God will remember it. Upon our Garments we indure not vncleannes an houre, not a mote, not a little mote, but we bruſh, and beat, if we be not bruſhed; yea, the very ſhoo vpon our foote is regarded that it be cleane, and euery day we looke vnto it often: yet ſee (and tremble to thinke on it) our bodyes and ſoules are vncleane, and we ſee it not, no, we go not about to ſée it, but vſe all the means we can to be farre from the ſight of it, as ſports, playes, company, and ſuch like. We hate him that will rubbe vs that way, and we auoyd the place where ſinne is reprooued, It bréedeth melancholy, and marreth mirth, We cannot abide it at any hand. But remember you this your Chapter, and follow the Law of the Lord, if you will be ſafe.
                     3 The third Example is of the morall Law, in the 4. verſ, concerning raſh Oathes and vowes:
                         where, I pray you, carefully marke, That albeit raſhneſſe and inconſiderate haſte, with man hath ſome excuſe, before ſet and purpoſed actions; yet (with God) it is euill, and there muſt be an Expiatorie ſacrifice offred for it. Let it reforme our raſh ſwearing in our common talke, and our fooliſh vowing of things neither lawfull, nor in our power. And thinke with your ſelfe, whether they erre not greatly, that thinke what they haue raſhly ſworne and vowed they muſt néedes kéepe, when you ſée héere, God would haue them offer a ſinne-offering for their raſhneſſe; and not adde more ſinne vnto it, by performing what they haue ſinfully ſayd. Alſo by this occaſion conſider, how defiled creatures we are before our God, when éuen that is ſinne in vs, wherein we haue not a minde to ſinne, as in ſuch raſh things wée often haue not.
                     
                        
4 But if he bee not able to bring a Sheepe, hee ſhall

                        bring for his treſpaſſe which hee hath committed, two Turtle-Doues, or two young Pigeons vnto the Lord, one for a Sinne-offering, and the other for a Burnt-offering.
                         Now ſée the ſwéete goodneſſe of the Lord to his poore People, that are not able to bring ſuch Offerings to him as others doe, and ſo by the ſubtiltie of Satan, and frailtie of Faith might be drawen to thinke that God regarded them as men doe, that is, either little, or not at all. To theſe he appointeth ſmall Offerings, framing his Lawe to their powers, and ſo giuing them moſt ſwéete and true comfort of his loue to them, as alſo in accepting of their little aſwell as of the greater Sacrifices of richer perſons. It hath béene touched before, but it can neuer be learned too much, ſo weake are we, and ſubiect to doubts.
                     5 Note againe in the 11. Verſe, how no Oyle might 
                        The Ceremonie of Oyle, and Incenſe. 
                        bee put vpon that Offering, neither any incenſe. Oyle ſignifying gladneſſe, and Incenſe a ſwéete ſauour. The Lord by this Ceremonie ſhadowed how hatefull a thing ſinne is, and all that commit it, till the Lord be reconciled to them againe. He hath no ioy in vs, neither yéeld we any ſwéet ſauor. And as he ioyeth not in vs, ſo ſhould we not ioy in our ſelues. For if we do, we powre Oyle vpon our Sacrifice, contrary to the Law: and if we thinke well of our ſelues we put incenſe alſo vnto it. The Lord loueth a ſorrowing ſinner adorned with ſackcloth and aſhes, and they that ſo weepe, ſhall laugh: he abhorreth proud ſinners, that doe euill, and yet reioyce, aſſuring ſuch laughers that they ſhall weepe. But alas our dayes! who ſorrow leſſe than they that ſinne moſt? and who are more luſtie and iolye, than they that haue leaſt cauſe, (if they knew their eſtate?) Read the 21 of Iob, and ſée the merry dayes of the wicked, ſo in the Booke of Wiſedome againe, &amp; in many more places in the Scripture. Theſe men offer prayers to God at

times, after their faſhion; but they put Oyle and Incenſe vpon their Offering, they reioyce, and are merry being full of euill, and they thinke their ſmell is as Incenſe to God, pleaſing and acceptable, when hée abhorreth them, and all their workes. O, take héede therefore of this vuféelingneſſe, and remember this Ceremonie often in al your doings, and you diſliking your ſelfe, the Lorde ſhall like you in his liked and beloued Sonne, your onely Sauiour euer.
                     6 In the 15. verſe Sée and marke the Law againſt purloyning and taking away of Tythes or Firſt-fruites due to the Prieſts. God ſtill loueth his Miniſters, and ſtill requireth, that they be honeſtly &amp; liberally maintained; God ſtill abhorreth the wilfull and wayward breakrs of ſuch Order for their maintenance, as the Chriſtian Magiſtrate in his authoritie (according to right) eſtabliſheth and appointeth. Therefore let ſuch as deſire to be acceptable to God, neither offend him, nor their own conſciences by ſuch fraud, and iniurie. S. Auguſtines Speach is as true, as old, The fault is not forgiuen with 
                        Non dimittitur peccatum, niſi reſtituatur ablatum. Aug: Epiſt. 54. contra Maced. Si res aliena propter quam peccatum eſt reddi poſſit, &amp; non redditur, poenitentia nō agitur, ſed fingitur. Idem.
                         
                        God, vnleſſe that which was taken away bee reſtored to men; not, that reſtitution taketh away ſinne before God, but becauſe true Faith muſt néedes haue good fruite, and cannot be without reſtitution, if there be power, and if not, yet in heart and will. For againe, Saint Auguſtine, If that which is another mans, ſinfully purloyned by me, be not reſtored, repentance is but feigned, there is none indeede. How little this falſe and vniuſt dealing with Gods Miniſters is regarded with many in theſe dayes, who knoweth not? and they are neuer troubled for it, much leſſe doe they purpoſe either reſtitution, or amendment. But the day will come, when it will ſmart, this Lawe of God hauing his enduring equitie, and God in other places profeſſing, That this robbing of his ſeruants is the robbing of him; 
                        Malach. 3. 8. Leuit. 22. 14. and ſo he taketh it, and ſo will puniſh it. But let this

ſuffice of this Chapter. Theſe things will come in other places to be remembred againe.

And ſecondly, ſetteth out more fully the Rites and Ceremonies of other Sacrifices, briefly touched before, beginning with the fire and aſhes of the Burnt-offering. Of the former the Text ſaith thus. If any ſinne and commit a treſpaſſe againſt the

                        Verſe 6. 
                        the Lord, a Ramme without blemiſh out of the flocke in thy eſtimation worth two ſickles for a treſpaſſe Offering vnto the Prieſt. And the Prieſt ſhall make an atonement 
                        Verſ. 7. 
                        for him before the Lord, and it ſhall bee forgiuen him, whatſoeuer thing hee hath done, and treſpaſſed therein. This Place thus written out at large, yéeldeth great comfort to many a trembling ſoule, and therefore

duely to be regarded. Sinnes of ignorance haue not ſuch blackneſſe in them (although Sinnes, as you ſaw before,) as ſinnes wittingly and willingly committed: and therefore, when féeling commeth, this Circumſtance of knowledge greatly afflicteth the conſcience. But bleſſed be God, euen theſe ſinnes alſo finde mercie with him vpon true Repentance. So did Abraham for his lye, (which contrary to his knowledge) hée wittingly and willingly committed. So did Dauid for his fall, Peter, and many more. Here you ſée a Speciall ſacrifice appointed, and an atonement to bee made. Should it not be ſo likewiſe now, that euen for theſe ſinnes there were an atonement by Ieſus Chriſt, our ſtate vnder the Goſpell were worſe than theirs vnder the Law. Yet let no mercie and goodneſſe in God make vs bolde and preſumptuous to ſinne, but with Dauid pray againſt ſuch kinde of ſinning euer. Keepe me O, Lord, from preſumptuous ſinnes, that they haue not dominion ouer me, &amp;c.
                     
                     2 You may obſerue the examples or particulars layd downe in the Text, and ſée how before God all theſe are ſinnes which yet many perſons in the world make little reckoning of, To denie the thing committed to our keeping, To breake the truſt repoſed in vs, To robbe our Neighbours and violently to take things from them, To denie that which was loſt and wee haue found, To ſweare falſly many times, and euen for trifles, with ſuch like, doe euery one thinke them ſinnes, and ſtand in feare to commit them? No, we know it well, they are lightly thought of by too many. But let Gods Lawe profit all his to a true knowledge what is ſinne, and to a due care to auoide it, when we know it. So ſhall it he well with vs for euer, and with thoſe alſo we wiſh well vnto after vs, to a thouſand generations.
                     3 Note in the 5. verſ. The reſtitution againe which God appointeth to be made to the owners, euen with

a fift part more, the ſame day that hee offereth for his treſpaſſe. And ſtill gather this Doctrine for your vſe, VVhen we will agree with God, we muſt alſo agree with

                        That GOD is neuer pleaſed with any thing that is ours, whileſt wee retaine and keepe that which is not ours. But marke well an Offering to the Lord, beſide that ſatiſfaction of men. And through all Moſes, finde me a place where ſinne is taken away otherwiſe than by Sacrifice. Now, whatſoeuer is attributed to the Sacrifices, the ſame is plainly taken away from mans workes. And if it was neuer the meaning of God to tye that people to the out-ward Sacrifice it ſelfe, but by the ſame to leade them to Chriſt ſhadowed by the Sacrifice, then apparant it is to all men, that there is no meanes to take away ſinne, but onely by Chriſt: Which all men will not confeſſe, becauſe they would eſtabliſh works in farther ſtrength thā 
                        God hath giuen.
                     4 Well, weigh it againe, in the 7. verſe and euer Verſ. 7. throughout theſe Bookes, That the Prieſt muſt make the a
                              •
                           onement; ſo euer ſignifying, that not in the Sacrifice, but in the Prieſt-hood was the matter. Now, that Prieſt-hood noted Chriſt his Office. And therefore, as then no Sacrifice pleaſed, but offered by the Prieſt, ſo at this day nothing of ours, as prayer, and ſuch like auaileth, but in Chriſt, and by Chriſt our onely and eternall High-Prieſt. Againe, the Text ſaith, before the Lord this atonement ſhall be, thereby ouerthrowing the wicked error of them, that affirmed a ciuill purgation onely of ſinne by thoſe Sacrifices, and not any ſpirituall promiſe in them. Which, I ſay, is moſt wicked, as well as falſe. Becauſe ſo, thoſe Sacrifices and Exerciſes of pietie, ſhould no way haue ſerued, to bréede and ſtrengthen Faith, in man touching his ſpirituall eſtate, whereunto in déede they wholly aymed, and effectually wrought in the godly that vſed them rightly.
                     5 The ſecond point in this Chapter is, concerning the Rites and Ceremonies of the Sacrifices; And firſt of

the firevpon the Altar, wherwith the Burnt-offering was conſumed. The Text is thus. Then the Lord ſpake vnto Moſes ſaying, Command Aaron and his ſonnes ſaying, This is the Law of the Burnt-offering, (it is the Burnt-offering,

                        becauſe it burneth vpon the Altar all the night vnto the morning, and the fire burneth on the Altar, &amp;c.) So carefull is God of this continuall burning, that (if you marke) it is repeated ouer and ouer. In the 12. verſe againe, but the fire vpon the Altar ſhall burne there

                        and neuer be put out. Againe in the 13. verſe, The fire ſhall euer burne vpon the Altar, and neuer goe out, &amp;c. To this ende, the Prieſts care was to féede it with wood, and ſée to it, day and night, and with no other fire might either Sacrifice, or Incenſe, be burned and offered to God. This fire was carefully kept vpon the Altar to the captiuitie of Babilon, and afterward found againe of Nehemias, 2. Mach

The Perſians called it Oriſmada, that is, Holy-fire, and in publicke pompe they vſed to carry it before Kings, with great ſolemnitie. A merry Tale there is of this god (Fire) which I will repeate. The Chaldeans, ſay our Bookes, worſhipping this vaine god, proudly boaſted that of all other gods he was the ſtrongeſt, conquering and conſuming all other gods of the Gentiles. And no maruell, for they were either wood or mettall that by fire might bée defaced. This bragge at laſt came to the eares of a Prieſt of Canopus. This Canopus was Maiſter of Menelaus ſhippes, and dying in an Jland, at the entrie of Nilus, the famous Riuer of Egypt, cauſed that Iland to be called after his name, and was there honoured for a God. This Prieſt fearing leſt

his god Canopus (the Image béeing belike of ſome mettall) might come in contempt, and ſo his liuing be taken away, deuiſed thus with himſelfe. Hée got a water-pot full of holes, (like vnto theſe that we water gardens withall) ſtopped vp all the holes with waxe, filled it full of water, painted it very trimme, and ſetting it very artificially vpon the toppe of the old Image of his god Canopus, brought him foorth to contend with the Chaldeans god of fire, which of them ſhould be the greater. The fire was ſet about him, and great expectation in the beholders, which way the victorie would goe. By and by, when the heat of the fire had melted the waxe that ſtopped the holes of the pot, the water began to ſtreame out at all the holes, &amp; quite put out the fire about it. Then there was a cry by all Canopus friends, Victorie, victorie: and from that time Canopus that Idoll was counted, through this ſubtiltie of the Prieſt, the strongeſt God of all others. Thus blinde are men, when God giueth not light, and thus eaſily abuſed when they are blinde. We may maruell leſſe at this great ſimplicity, if we conſider what is taught and held by theſe, that thinke themſelues wiſe in theſe dayes; Namely, that the water, called Holy-Water, ſprinkled in the graue of a dead man, not only purgeth the ſame man from all ſpot of ſinne, but extinguiſheth alſo, in great part, that fell-fire, which they call Purgatorie-fire. Thus you ſée mens follyes both of fire and water. But paſſe we them ouer, and come to the Matter. What might be the reaſon, why God appoynted this Ceremonie of continuall fire vpon the Altar, and Sempiterna Chriſti occiſi
                              •
                           , per ſempiternum ignem. &amp;c. how may we profit by it? Firſt, there was figured by it, the death of Chriſt from the beginning of the world, Namely that he was the Lambe ſlayne from the beginning for Mankinde, and by this ſhadow they were led to beléeue, That although as yet Chriſt was not come in the fleſh, neuertheleſſe the fruit of his death belonged

to them, aſwell as to thoſe that ſhould liue when hée came, or was come: for this fire was continuall and went not out, no more did the fruite of his Paſſion faile to any True-beleeuer, euen from the beginning. But they were ſaued by beléeuing that he ſhould come, as we are now, by beleeuing that he is come. Alſo this fire came from Heauen, Leuit. 9. verſ.
                         24: and ſo ſhould Chriſt in the time appointed. This fire was euer in, and neuer went out; and ſo is God euer ready to accept our Sacrifices and appointed duties, euer ready to heare vs and forgiue vs; but we are ſlow and dull, and come not to him, as we ought. No other fire might be vſed but this, and ſo they were taught to kéepe to Gods Ordinances, and to flye from all inuentions of their owne heads. For euer it was true, and euer will be true, In vaine do men worſhip me, teaching for Doctrines mens 
                        Mat. 15. 9. 
                        praecepts. Our owne deuiſes (ſéeme they neuer ſo wiſe, ſo fit, ſo holy and excellent) they are ſtrange fire, not that fire that came from Heauen, Not that fire that God will be pleaſed withall, or indure. This fire comming firſt from Heauen and thus preſerued, ſtill preached vnto them by figure, that aſwell did their Sacrifices and ſeruices duly performed according to the Law pleaſe God; as that did when firſt God ſent his fire from Heauen to conſume it, in token of approbation, which ſurely was a great comfort to their conſciences, and a mightie proppe to fainting, fearing, weake Faith. This fire thus mayntayned and kept with all care, and not ſuffered euer to goe out, taught them, and ſtill may teach vs, to be carefull to kéepe in the fire of Gods holy ſpirit, that it neuer die, nor go out within vs. The fire is kept in with wood, with breath, or blowing, and with aſhes: ſo is Gods Spirit kept in (that holy and happy fire) by honeſt life as by wood; by true ſighes of vnfained repentance, as by breath or blowing, and by méeke humilitie as by ſoft aſhes. O, that we may haue

care to kéepe it in! what ſhould I ſay? This continued fire taught then, (and though it be now gone and abrogated) may ſtill teach vs now to be carefull to kéepe in, amongſt vs, the fire of Gods Word, the true preaching of his Truth, to the ſaluation of our ſoules. Fooliſh men, fooliſhly will imitate this Law, by maintening of lights and Lampes, candels and tapers to burne continually, but let vs care to preſerue this Lampe and Light of Gods Goſpell amongſt vs, that it goe not out, and God ſhall be pleaſed, We and ours bettered in his bleſſing. It had bene a hainous ſinne then to ſuffer the fire of the Altar to goe foorth; and can wée thinke it is no ſinne now, by taking away the maintenance, to ſerue our gréedy couetouſneſſe, to put out this fire from amongſt vs, and all Gods people about vs? GOD make Patrons thinke of it, and giue them conſcience before there be no more time for mercie. Fitly is the Preaching of the Goſpell ſhadowed by the fire vpon the Altar, conſuming the Burnt-offering. For the fire hath theſe properties, it ſhineth and giueth light, it heateth, it conſumeth, it tryeth: ſo the Preaching of the Goſpell. Thy

                         calleth it a Candle in a darke place, and many Scriptures teach the ſhining light of it. The Luke 24. 32. 
                        heate in like ſort, Did not our hearts burne within vs, whileſt he talked with vs, and opened the Scriptures? The

                        fire kindled, and I ſpake with my tongue ſaith the Pſalme, and as fire it pleaſed the Holy Spirit to appeare at Pentecoſt, 
                        Act. 2. 3. to ſhew this fruite of effect of the Word preached by their mouthes, it heateth the heart to all good life, and maketh vs zealous of good workes. The droſſe of our corruption by degrées it waſheth, the ſtubble of our fancies it burneth-vp and conſumeth, ſo that we abhorre the ſinnes we haue bene pleaſed with, and hate the remembrance of euill paſſed. Laſtly, it tryeth Doctrine, and ſeuereth Truth from error; it tryeth men, and

diſcouereth Hypocrites. All worthy Motiues to make vs carefull to preſerue this fire perpetually amongſt vs whileſt we liue, and in a holy zeale to prouide for it alſo, when we are dead. So ſhall we liue béeing dead, Nay, ſo ſhall we aſſuredly neuer die, but with immortall ſoules, and neuer dying tongues, praiſe his Name that liueth foreuer, and will haue vs with him. This is the Ceremonie of the fire.
                     
                     6 The next Ceremonie is concerning the Aſhes of the Burnt-offering wherin your Chapter ſaith thus, ver. 10. And the Prieſt ſhal put on his linnen-garment, &amp; ſhall put 
                        Verſe. 10. 
                        on his linnen breeches vpō his fleſh, &amp; take away the aſhes, when the fire hath conſumed the Burnt-offering vpon the Altar, &amp; he ſhall put them beſide the Altar, &amp;c, to the 14. verſ. Firſt, concerning theſe linnen-breeches, you ſée the Law for them to be made Exod. 28. 42. with the Reaſon of the ſame, modeſtie and comelineſſe in their Miniſtrie.
                         
                        Verſ. 11. &amp;c. 
                        This putting-off their garments figured that bareing of our Sauiour Chriſt when hée ſuffered, from his Garments; 
                        Mat. 27. 35. ſo that as the Prieſt héere layd aſide the clothes he ware, and put his linnen-breeches about his nakedneſſe; euen ſo was the Lord Ieſus ſtripped out of all his clothes, and, onely with his nakedneſſe couered, nayled vpon the Croſſe for our ſake. Some haue ſaid alſo, that this laying aſide of their garments, ſhadowedout that laying aſide (as it were) of his Diuinitie, whileſt in his humanitie hée truely ſuffered vpon the Croſſe. Not that euer there was any reall ſeperation betwixt his Natures, (that being impoſſible;) but becauſe his God-head did (as it were) hide it ſelfe, by not ſhewing his Power, that the decréed Saluation of man (by the meanes alſo decréed) might be effected. The carying the aſhes foorth without the Hoſte, notably figured-out the ſuffering and buriall of Chriſt, with-out the Citie of Hieruſalem, which was performed. The aſhes 
                        Mat. 27. 
                        were to be put in a cleane place, not prophaned or abuſed,

or careleſly caſt away; ſo to note, that although Chriſt his body ſhould dye, and be as aſhes in the conceite of men, yet ſhould that body reuiue againe, and muſt not be putrified, but put in a cleane place, euen a newe Tombe, wherein neuer any man lay before, &amp;c. Mat. 27. 60.
                     
                     7 In the 14. verſe and ſo to the 19. The Ceremonies of 
                        Verſe 14. &amp;c. 
                        the Meat-offering are more fully ſet down, thā they were before, in the ſecond Chapter. That the remnant ſhould 
                        Cap. 2. 3. 
                        be the Prieſts,
                         was before ſaid; but it was not laydedowne how Aaron and his ſonnes ſhould vſe this remnant. Wherefore now it is further added, That they ſhould eate it, verſ.
                         16. But how? It ſhall be eaten without 
                        Verſe 16. 17. 18. 
                        Leauen, in the holy Place, in the court of the Tabernacle. The Males onely might eat it, and not women, &amp;c. What Leauen vſually in Scripture ſignifieth, you haue heard before, Namely, corrupt doctrine, and bad life, with either which, the Lord would not haue his Prieſtes ſtained. In the holy Place onely, and not elſe-where muſt they eate it, to ſignifie, that onely in the Church is the benefit of Chriſt to be had, and not out of the Church. The branch beareth not fruite but in the Uine, and the Uine is onely in the Uine-yard. This Church is not a building of lyme and ſtone, but a ſocietie of Chriſtian people, among whom the Goſpell is truly preached, the Sacraments duely and rightly adminiſtred, and who with one conſent firmely beléeue, that they haue remiſſion of ſinnes, and life euerlaſting, not by the merits of mans righteouſneſſe, but by, and for the merites and righteouſnes of the Lord Ieſus onely. To be in the Church therfore, is not to be in the place of Lyme and ſtone built to méete in; but to be one of this number, that holdeth and beléeueth as all Patriarks and Prophets, Apoſtles and Martyrs, and all the faithfull Elect of God, euer haue done from the beginning of man, and hereafter ſhall doe to the ende of the world, who all, as you ſée, by theſe Sacrifices were drawen to Chriſt,
                        
and Chriſt onely, or elſe their Sacrifice auailed them nothing, but to them was vnprofitable, and to the Lord God abhominable. In this Church are no Turkes, no Iewes, no Infidels, nor any that liue a wicked life, with careleſſe ſecuritie and ſinfull delight; or yet a holy ſtreit life in ſhew, but inwardly are nothing leſſe than they ſéeme. Wherefore with God they haue no remiſſion of ſinnes, and without a change they ſhall alſo fayle of eternall life. That here the Males onely might eate, let it Leuit. 22. Numb. 18. lead you to the 18. of Numbers, which will make it moreplaine, ſhewing you there, what womē
                         might eat aſwell as the men. In ſome things they were barred, to ſignifie that God would not haue women beare any publike Office and charge in the Church as the Prieſts did, and as among the Heathens, women did, (to ſay nothing of ſome better knowen:) and againe in ſome things they were allowed to eate, that ſo it might appeare they belonged alſo to the Couenant of God, &amp; the merites of Chriſt ſhould ſaue them aſwel as men. For in Christ there is neither Male nor Female, bond nor free, 
                        Gal. 3. 28. 
                        rich nor poore, Noble nor baſe, but a new creature, that is, Chriſt reiecteth no ſort, but of what ſort ſoeuer, if they be new creatures, that is, borne a new by the Spirit to forſake ſinne, and liue vnto him in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, they are receiued, they are wel-come, and hee or ſhee that thus commeth, Hee neuer caſteth away, &amp;c. 
                        Iohn 6. 37.
                     
                     8 From this 19. verſe to the 24. the Meat-offering of the High-Prieſt, ſo often as he ſhould be elected, by Verſe 19. &amp;c. the death of the former, is layd downe, wherein this onely I note, That euery Meat-offering of the Priest,
                         
                        Verſe 23. 
                        muſt be wholly burned, and none eaten, as was of other Meat-offerings. Therein was ſhadowed the perfection of that Atonement and expiation which Chriſt made, and ſo their error confuted, that hold and teach the death of Chriſt onely to haue taken away originall ſinne, and

that men themſelues muſt ſatiſfie for actuall ſinnes. Or, that Chriſt hath merited but the firſt-grace for vs, that is, he hath merited, that we haerafter by our merites may take away our owne ſinnes and others, with ſuch like wicked and damnable aſſertions. But euer remember you, That here this Offering was wholely burned, and no part left to man; to teach, that euen ſo in appeaſing Gods wrath, Chriſts Sacrifice of it ſelfe was moſt perfect, and no part left vnto man in that matter. Other Scriptures alſo abundantly teach ſo much, which now often haue bin touched, and ſtill muſt, to the end of this Booke. Worthy is that Place of the Apoſtle to the Corinthians, where ſpeaking of actuall ſinnes, as Adulterie, Fornication, worſhipping of Idols, &amp;c, Such 
                        1. Cor. 6. 11. (ſaith he) were ſome of you: but yee are waſhed, but yee are ſanctified, but yee are iuſtified in the Name of the Lord Ieſus, &amp; by the Spirit of our God.
                         Héere euen actuall ſinnes, and not onely originall are taught to be taken away by Chriſt, and by Chriſt onely. To which agréeth the like Saying to Titus, and many more. And as for Titus. 3. 3. &amp;c. Luke 17. 10. our merites, the words are playne, When we haue done all, We muſt ſay, we are vnprofitable ſeruants &amp;c.
                     
                     9 Laſtly, in this Chapter, you haue the Ceremonies 
                        Verſ. 2. 4. &amp;c. of the ſinne-offering touched againe, from the 24. verſe to the end of ye 
                        Chapter. All tending to teach this ſtrongly, That out of the Church, 
                        
                           •
                        here is no benefit to be reaped by Chriſt, as before hath béene ſayd. Namely, this Ceremonie, that if any of the blood dropped vpon a 
                        27. 
                        garment, that blood might not ſo be caryed out of the holy Place, but muſt there be waſhed away, and not caryed out. What a plaine figure was this, That Chriſts blood profiteth none out of the Church? If it were an 28. 
                        earthen pot that it was ſodden in, it muſt be broken, not applyed after to prophane vſes, and if a braſen-pot, then ſcowred and waſhed with water, all to teach the holines of Chriſts blood which ſhould be ſhed for man,

and how odious and damnable it is, after we are waſhed and purged by this blood, to giue our members againe to vncleannes and ſinne, and to faſhion our ſelues like vnto this wicked world. Many things more doth both this Chapter and others containe, if with exact curioſitie, they ſhould be ſtood vpon, and euery particular examined; but my purpoſe being onely to giue a taſte of the vſe of the Scriptures, to our edification and comfort, (when we read, and haue not better helpes) this much may ſerue to that ende, and ſo in euery Chapter, onely a touch of things ſhall ſerue. GOD (in mercie) giue it a bleſſing to vs.
                     Amen.

                        NOw to the Rites and Ceremonies of the Treſpaſſe-Offering, 
                        Verſe. 1. which are héere more fully deſcribed than in the 4. Chapter before. This kinde of Offering was not vulgar, but it was reckoned amongſt the moſt Holy; and therefore hath ſuch Rites and vſage as they had. It was killed in the place where the Burnt-offering was killed, Namely, at the North-ſide of the Altar; ſo ſhadowing Verſe. 2. alſo that Chriſt ſhould die at Hieruſalem of which the Prophet ſaith. On the North-ſide is the cittie of the great King. The blood was ſprinckled round about on the altar, ſhadowing that the merites of Chriſts-blood ſhould be ſprinckled by preaching throughout all Nations. The Inwards were burned to aſhes, ſhadowing, that all the Verſ. 3. 4. 5. honour and reputation of Chriſt, was by his ignominious death and Paſſion brought (as it were) to aſhes,
                        
that is, to no account with men that knew not the myſterie of it. All they that ſee me, laugh me to ſcorne: they 
                        Pſal. 22. 7. 8. 
                        ſhoote out their lippes, and ſhake their heads, ſaying: He truſted in God, that he would deliuer him: let him deliuer him if he will haue him, &amp;c. My ſtrength is dryed-vp 
                        15. 
                        like a pot-ſheard, and my tongue cleaueth to my gummes, and thou ſhalt bring me into the duſt of death, &amp;c. The remnant was eaten by the Prieſt
                         in token that the benefit of Chriſt belongeth to the Faithfull. The Skinne of the 
                        verſe 6, 7. verſe 8, 9, 10. 
                        Burnt-offcring here, was the Prieſts, and all the Meat-offering that is baked in the Ouen, &amp; that is dreſſed in the panne, &amp;c. Why God ſhould thinke of ſo ſmale and baſe a thing, as the Skinne, ſome may aſke a Reaſon? and ſée you the Reaſon, and the good of it. Firſt, it notably confirmeth our Faith in his Prouidence, that hée will neuer forget vs, and leaue vs deſtitute of things néedfull and good for vs, ſéeing we are much better than the skinne of a brute beaſt, whereof yet, hée hath care and thought. Therefore we muſt not ſhrinke in the time of want, nor hearken to Satan that ſo buſily layeth our infirmities and vnworthineſſe before vs, that ſo hée may ſhake vs off from God, and make vs beléeue, hée will neuer regard ſo vile perſons, &amp;c. But let Faith anſwere, auoyde Satan. For I learne that God regardeth Mat. 16. 23. the Sparrowes, and forſaketh them not, though two 
                        Mat. 10. 29. 31. 
                        of them ſhall be ſold for a farthing yea, the beaſtes skinne in the Law hée vouchſafed to thinke of and to diſpoſe of it, to his will, and hée telleth vs we are better than Sparrowes, and therefore better alſo than the beaſts-skinne, that hath no life, as the Sparrowes haue. Hée ſaith, O yee of little Faith, If we doubt of it, and therefore Mat. 8. 26. I know, he will, and doth thinke of me, and I ſhal haue, in his time, euer what is conuenient and profitable. Secondly, it ſhewed that ſwéete and comfortable care that the Lord then had, and ſtill hath of the Miniſterie, that it ſhould be maintained, and not defrauded

of the leaſt thing alotted to it, which ſtill he ſheweth in all other particulars, vrging ſtill, that they be giuen to ye 
                        Prieſts according to his will. Great things to moue our conſciences in theſe dayes, if God be with vs, to a true and iuſt dealing with thoſe that ſerue at the Altar amongſt vs, and not ſo gréedily, ſo wickedly, and ſo vnféelingly to rob and ſpoyle them, as we do. If this people of the Iewes had done ſo, in theſe matters alotted to the Prieſts, as we do with our Tythes, and portions giuen to the Church in our dayes: do you think, or can you think GOD would haue indured it? No, you know well he would not. And is he changed? will he not ſtill haue vs taught by the Ordinance of his Word, &amp; ſtill them that ſerue at the Altar, to liue of ye 
                        Altar? Are not theſe duties from vs now, as due as euer thoſe were then? It may not, it cannot with truth be denyed. How then may we firſt or laſt, eſcape the wrath of God for ſinning ſo, as if the Iewes had ſinned, we confeſſe that God would haue ſeuerely puniſhed it? If you ſay, ſo much, and ſo much is ynough for him, and this, &amp; that he may ſpare: Make the caſe ſo of the Iſraelites, and in this particular of the beaſts skinne, durſt any fleſh haue ſo reaſoned then? Beware therefore of making your ſelfe a iudge where you are none, of robbing them, that haue the title, and inriching your ſelfe that haue no right. What is alotted by the Gouernment you liue vnder, is his and not yours, if he be not worthy ſo much, the Law helpeth that by a due tryall of him, and yet leaueth the maintenance ſtill to a more worthy, not to you. Harden not your heart againſt God, againſt Law, againſt right and truth; accuſtome not your heart to couet your neighbours due, your hands to purloyne it by fraude, or to take it by ſtrēgth, it is theft, ſpiritual theft, Sacriledge, your houſe receiueth ſtolne-goods, &amp; the wrath of God may happily ſhake the foundation of it for ſuch ſin, and you in yours, or you &amp; yours be puniſhed. Thirdly, this

care of the Lord for the beaſts-skinne, to appoint it to one that ſhould haue it, well taught that people then, and ſtill teacheth vs euer, to be carefull to preuent ſtrife, and to take away all Queſtions and controuerſies as much as wée may, that euery one knowing what is his, may therein reſt, and peace enſue. The more God hath giuen you, the more muſt bée your payne this way, in your good health and perfect memorie.
                     2 Your Chapter goeth on with the Peace-offering, 
                        Verſ. 11. 12. whereof he ſpecifieth two ſorts: the one of Thankeſgiuing, the other of a Vow. Touching the firſt, you remember how greatly GOD teſtifieth his liking of it throughout the Scriptures. In the 50. Pſalme, he ſéemeth to preferre it before all others in ſome ſort. For I will not reprooue thee (ſaith God) for thy Sacrifices, or
                         
                        Pſal. 50. 8. 
                        forthy Burnt-offerings, becauſe they were not alway before me. I will take no Bullocke out of thy houſe, nor heegoates 
                        9. 10. 
                        out of thy Folds. For all the beaſts of the Forreſt are mine, and ſo are the cattell vpon a thouſand hilles &amp;c. Offer vnto God thankeſgiuing, and pay thy Vowes 
                        14. 23. 
                        vnto the Moſt-High. Who ſo offereth vnto mee thankes and prayſe, he honoureth mee: and to him that ordereth his conuerſation aright, will I ſhew the ſaluation of God. Vnto thee therefore O God (ſaith Dauid) will I pay my
                         
                        Pſal. 56. 12. Pſal. 107. 22. 
                        vowes, vnto thee will I giue thankes. O that men would prayſe the Lord for his goodneſſe, &amp;c! O that they would offer vnto him the Sacrifice of Thankeſgiuing, and tell out his workes with gladneſſe! and ſo foorth all the Pſalme ouer, you ſée it is repeated as the foote of his Song. Ionas ſaid, I will Sacrifice vnto thee with the voyce of 
                        Ionas 2. 9. 
                        Thankeſgiuing, and will pay thee that that I haue vowed: Saluation is of the Lord. I will prayſe the Name of God
                         
                        Pſal: 93. 3

                           . (ſaith Dauid againe,) with a Song, and magnifie it with Thankeſgiuing. This ſhall pleaſe the Lord better than a 
                        3

                           . 
                        Bullocke that hath hornes and hooſes. Yet careth not the Lord ſo much for this in reſpect of himſelfe, as forman,

becauſe there is nothing, that increaſeth Feeling, Faith, Hope, and Prayer, as this exerciſe of Thankſgiuing doth. Let it therefore be in vſe with vs more and more, that is ſo accepted of him, to whom we owe ſo much.
                     3 In the 13. verſe you ſée Leauen admitted of, which verſe 13. before you remember was reiected and forbidden. Hee ſhall offer his Offering with cakes of Leauened-bread, &amp;c. Leauen therefore in the Scripture is taken both in ill part, and in good part. In ill part, Matth. 16. 6. 1. Cor. 5. 6. Gal. 5. 9. In good part, Matth. 13. verſe 33. and Luk. 13. verſe. 21. when the Apoſtles are reſembled to a little Leauen, that leaueneth the whole Lumpe, they being ſent out of God into the vnleauened world by preaching and teaching to leauen it cleane through. And there is a Leauen of the new nature accepted, as the Leauen of our old nature is reiected. For looke how the Leauen maketh the bread ſauourie and ſtrong and wholeſome, Looke alſo how it maketh it riſe and heaue vp, which otherwiſe would be ſad and heauy: ſo doth Gods regenerate Spirit change vs, make vs ſauorie, and all our duties pleaſing to God in our new birth, and we riſe vp, yea, our hearts and ſoules are heaued vp in all loue and thankfulneſſe to him, that in mercie hath ſo looked vpon vs. This Leauen therefore of new nature is accepted. Try your ſelfe then in your ſecret Meditation, how you are ſeaſoned, whether with old Leauen, or new. It will be good for you to take this viewe, and heartily to pray for what you want. Are you a Miniſter called of God to leauen his people with good Leauen? Looke how you doe it, and be painfull: Faithfulneſſe will be crowned, when ſlouthfulneſſe ſhall be condemned, and condemne you. And ſubmit your ſelfe to the profit of your people, not hunting after your owne glory, that you are thus and ſo learned, eloquent, profound, and ſo foorth. If your people profit not, becauſe you flie too high a pitch for them, and ſcorne to lay a foundation of the

                        Catechiſme among them, you will be found an vnprofitable ſeruant in the Reckoning-day, one that hath gayned Mat. 25. 2
                              •
                           . nothing to his Lord, but hid his talent in the fowle Napkin of fruitleſſe matter, and idle figures of affected ſpéech. Are you a hearer and no teacher? Looke at your Leauen: doth it heaue you vp in thankes for the Goſpell vouchſafed vnto you? in loue to them that truely preach it? in honeſt life to them that looke at our example? Doe you ſeaſon your children, ſeruants, &amp; familie, as you are able: This is new leauen then in you, and good leauen, accepted of GOD, and profitable to your ſelfe: be thankefull for it, and God increaſe the meaſure of it.
                     4 In the 14. verſe you read thus. Of all the Sacrifice 
                        Verſe 14. 
                        hee ſhall offer one Cake for an heaue-offering vnto the Lord &amp;c. And bui one Cake, (ſaith a Writer vpon this Booke) was appointed, that it might ſhadow out one Holy Communion to be celebrated in time to come of the Church, and not ſo many Maſſes, euen Maſſes vpon Maſſes, &amp;c.
                     
                     5 In the 15. verſe, &amp;c. A Law is made that the 15. 
                        Fleſh of the Peace-offerings for thankeſgiuing, ſhall bee eaten the ſame day that it is offered; and nothing thereof left vntill the Morning. A Ceremonie vſed (ſaith One) to ſignifie that publike Feaſts ſhould not be ſuperfluouſly continued, and kept long vnder the colour of Religion. For GOD loueth not idle banquetting and prodigall ſpending, although hée alow graciouſly what is fit for the occaſion. Mariage-Feaſts therefore in ſome Places according to the equitie of this Law are reſtrayned to one day, or two dayes, and not more. So of other lawfull occaſions of méetings. A Ceremonie (ſayth Another) made in wiſedome by God; leſt, if the Fleſh ſhould haue ſmelled by longer kéeping, Religion might Caluin. ſo haue béene vile in the eyes of tickle perſons. Happily alſo (ſaith the ſame Perſon) to reſtraine vaine glory,

which ſome would haue ſhewed in ſacrificing often, with ſmall charge, if the meat might haue béene kept ſalted, and ſo offered againe for a glorie.
                     6 But if the Sacrifice of his Offering be a 
                              Ʋow, or a 
                        Verſ. 16. 
                        Free-offering, it ſhall be eaten the ſame day that he offereth his Sacrifice: and ſo in the Morning the reſidue thereof ſhall be eaten. But as much of the offered fleſh as remayneth 
                           Verſe 17. Verſe 18. 
                           vnto the third day, ſhall be burned with fire. For if any of the Fleſh of his Peace-offerings bee eaten in the third day, he ſhall not be accepted that offereth it, neither ſhall it be reckoned vnto him, but ſhall be an abhomination: therefore the perſon that eateth of it ſhall beare his iniquitie.
                         That is, the Sinne for which he offered, ſhall ſtill remayne and not be forgiuen. The Fleſh then of the firſt ſort, muſt be eaten the ſame day, and this of the ſecond ſort, in two dayes, none might be eaten the third day, but (if any remained) burned. A Ceremony (ſay ſome) fore-telling and fore-ſhewing that this out-ward worſhip of God by Sacrifices, and ſuch Ceremonies ſhould haue his being no longer, than vnto the Reſurrection of the Meſſiah, which was on the third day. Others make vſe of this Ceremonie thus, euē to learne thereby, that the taking hold of Chriſt and his benefits, is not to be deferred and put off, but ſpedily and quickly to be done, whileſt time ſerueth &amp; oportunitie is offered: for behold (ſaith Chriſt) to day, and to morrow, I caſt out Deuils, and the third day, &amp;c. Luke 13. 32. that is, a ſhort Luke 13. 32. time I haue yet to go on with my Miniſterie, and then I ſhall be ſlaine. So the Phraſes, to day, and to Morrow, ſignifie a ſhort time, and therefore when this Law alotteth but one day to eat the one ſort, and but two at the vttermoſt for the ſecond, well may we learne by it, that whileſt by the Preaching of the Word, the fruite and benefit of Chriſt is offered, we ſpéedily take hold and deferre not, leſt the time elaſpe, and we finde the doore ſhut againſt vs. This poynt hath bene handled before.
                     
                        
7 Others deuide all time into three dayes (as it were,) and the firſt day they make from Adam to Chriſt; The ſecond, from Chriſt to the Iudgement; and The third, euer after. In theſe two firſt dayes, the Gate is open to true penitent ſinners, that come when they are called, without putting-off from day to day, but theſe two dayes neglected and ended, there is no more ſacrifice for 
                           ••
                        nne, no more mercie, no Chriſt, nor Comfort any longer, but a fearefull expectation of iudgement, and eternall death for euer. More particularly euery man and woman may be ſaid to haue three dayes; The firſt of Youth till Age come; The ſecond of Age till death come; and in theſe two dayes there is mercie offered; but the 3. day is after death, and then no helpe: As here on the 3. day no Offering was accepted, but the ſinne remayned vnpardoned and not forgiuen. All theſe applications by Godly men, tending to our good, are agreable to the proportion of Faith, &amp; we may be bettered by them.
                     8 In the 19. verſe &amp;c. You haue another Law of 
                        verſe 19. 
                        vncleanneſſe growing by touching. For the Fleſh, (ſayth your Chapter) that toucheth any vncleane thing ſhall not be eaten, but burnt with fire, &amp;c. Againe, If any eate of 
                        Chap. 15. 3. 20. 
                        the Fleſh of the Peace-offerings that pertayne to the Lord, hauing his vncleanneſſe vpon him, euen the ſame perſon ſhall bee cut-off from his people. Moreouer when any 
                        21. 
                        toucheth any vncleane thing, as the vncleanneſſe of man, or of an vncleane beaſt, or of any filthy abhomination and eate of the Fleſh of the Peace-offerings, which pertayneth vnto the Lord, euen that perſon ſhall bee cut-off from his people. A man would thinke, that rather this Fleſh of the Sacrifice repreſenting Chriſt ſhonld ſanctifie all things that it touched, than be defiled by any thing, ſo that it might not be eaten. But the Ceremonie aptly teacheth, what it was intended for, if you marke it. For as it was meant, it ſheweth that Chriſt ſanctifieth and bettereth none, but ſuch as take hold of him by a

true Faith. To others, if they touch him, hée is vncleane (not in himſelfe, who euer is holy and pure, the immaculate Lambe of God)
                         but accidentally, he is hurtfull by reaſon of their want of Faith, and prophaneſſe, according to the Scripture. We preach Chriſt Crucified;

                         And that the vncleane Toucher of this Sacrifice was to be cut-off, it taught them the puniſhment of vnreformed Hypocrites, and ſtill doth ſhew what ſhall bée the ende of thoſe that touch Chriſt, that is, beare his Name and are called Chriſtians, vſe his Word, come to his Sacraments, and yet, as the Pſalme ſaith, Hate to bee amended: ſurely, they ſhall be cut-off; their ende ſhall Pſal. 50. 17. be deſtruction, and they ſhall periſh eternally.

                     9 The forbidding to eate the fat, was a Ceremonie, 
                        verſe 23. that euen at home in their houſes contynued them after a ſort in the exerciſe of Religion. For ſtill they remembered 24. the Law, and obeyed the ſame. It alſo (as I haue noted before) preached vnto them figuratiuely, 
                        25. that for God (if he ſo appoint) all the ſwéet pleaſures of this world, riches, honours, friends, and whatſoeuer elſe, being as the fat pleaſing and delightfull, are forſaken, forborne, refuſed and left. A Leſſon neuer ynough 
                        Nunquam ſatis dicitur, quod nunquā ſatis diſcitur. 
                        learned, though often repeated; ſo cleane our hearts to this earth, and this fatneſſe thereof. But pray often, and pray heartily with Saint Auguſtine 
                        Da quod iubes, &amp; iube quid vis. Aug. That the Lord would vouchſafe to giue vs what hee requireth, and then require what he pleaſeth. Hée is ſtrong though

wée be weake; can make vs as contentedly leaue them, as euer we receiued and inioyed them.
                     10 The forbidding of them to eate the blood alſo, as Verſe. 26. 27 before hath béene noted, ſignified vnto them that the Lord abhorreth crueltie in euery Childe of his, and will haue them mercifull, pitifull, gentle, &amp;c. In the 30. verſ.

                        The bringing of the Sacrifice with his owne hands, and not ſending it by others, taught humilitie and dutie to God, taught that euery one muſt liue by his owne Faith, and not by anothers; and may ſerue vs now, to ſée how fooliſh an Error it is in Poperie, to giue another his beades to ſay them ouer for him that day &amp;c. The heauing of it vp, was a Figure of the lifting vp of Verſe 32. Iohn 12. 32. Numb. 2. 8. 9.

                        IF you turne to the 28. Chapter of Exodus, you ſhall finde the moſt of this Chapter there explaned; and therefore a bréefer touch may ſerue héere. It contayneth the Sacrifices and Ceremonies vſed at the Conſecration of 
                        The contents of this Chapter.

                         and fitly followeth vpon the other Chapters, becauſe after Sacrifices appointed, the next care is, for Prieſts to offer and vſe them according to appointment. For vſe and benefite to our ſelues; Firſt, let vs note, that this Office of holy Prieſt-hood was not of man, nor Verſ. 1. 2.

                        called to this Office by GOD) approach the Altar, hee was to dye. The Reaſons why the Lord thus preciſely appointed theſe Prieſts, and would not leaue it to euery man, to performe this Office, were theſe and ſuch like. Firſt, it was to be knowen, that not euery man, No, not any man, but the Man Chriſt Ieſus could appeaſe Gods wrath, ſatiſfie his iuſtice, and take away the ſinnes of the world, reconciling vs to GOD and putting vs in aſſurance of eternall life. This could not be figured out better, than by ſecluding all the whole Hoſte of Iſrael
                         from this Office, and chooſing but Aaron and his ſonnes as Types of Chriſt, this onely able Prieſt to doe (as I haue ſaid) and therefore they onely were choſen, and ſo by ſuch ordinance the Maieſtie, authoritie, and (if wée may ſo ſpeake) the propriety of Chriſts Office reſembled and ſhadowed. Secondly, God was euer the God of order, decencie, and comelines, and therefore in his Church would haue all things done accordingly, not induring any to be an inuader of an other mans right, an intruder of himſelfe into another mans Office, and a buſie-body out of Rule, out of order. Certaine men therefore are appointed, and they onely ſhall doe it. Others if they meddle, being ſtrangers, becauſe not called, ſhall dye the death, as you heare before.

For this is to denie the perfection of Chriſts one Oblation, and that there is now remiſſion of ſinnes, ſéeing the Scripture ſaith, Where there is remiſſion of ſinnes, 
                        Heb. 10. 18. Verſe 4. 
                        there is no more offering for ſinnes, &amp;c. Heb.

                     2 So Moſes did as the Lord God commanded him, and the companie was aſſembled at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. Obedience in Moſes the Head and chief, obedience alſo in the People vnder him, do offer vs here a good Example. Such mutuall agréement in great &amp; litle, to come together to the Tabernacle to vnderſtand further of Gods Wil, O, how commendable in it ſelf, how acceptable to God, how profitable for others that ſhall behold &amp; ſée it! Would God any thing might ſmite our hearts, to come to Gods Houſe diligently! Certainly, the praiſe of it wil endure whē we are dead, and ye bleſſing of ſuch zeale, vpon our childrēs children. Baniſh then vngodly whiſperers to the contrary, with all their deceitfull and damnable perſwaſions: and he that hath an eare let him heare what God will ſay to his ſoule. Let him ſpeake as that good Samuel was taught to ſpeake: Say on Lord, forthy Seruant heareth.

                        Gods Commandement doth Moſes offer vnto them. For he well knew, Gods will onely, in his owne Houſe, muſt be the Rule. Our own heads were neuer the beſt heads to follow; and for God, he knoweth our mould too well, to giue that ſwinge vnto vs. If we will preach his will, he hath a bleſſing, and if we teach our owne fancies, he will with his breath blowe away both vs, and our idle

fancies. We offering then but his will to his people, and by a plaine courſe of teaching, according to their capacities, making that appeare to them, as many as are ordayned

                        THe Conſecration of Aaron and his ſonnes being fully ended, in The Contents of this Chapter. 
                        this Chap: is ſhewed how they entred vpon their Office, &amp; began to doe the duties thereof, Aaron offering the foure principall Sacrifices, to witte, the Burnt-offering; the Sin-offering; the Peace-offering; &amp; the Meat-offering. And for vſe vnto vs. Firſt, it may be obſerued, that Moſes who was neuer conſecrated himſelfe, doth

conſecrate and inueſt Aaron into his Office, that ſo men might learne to aſcribe all to God, the authoritie I meane, and effect of the outward ſigne.

For ſuch an High-Prieſt (ſaith he) it became vs to haue, as needeth not dayly, like thoſe in the Law, to offer vp ſacrifice firſt for his owne ſinnes and then for his peoples, &amp;c. Read the 7. Chap. verſe 26 27. Alſo the 5. Chap. Verſe 3. Hée was alſo herein a Figure of Chriſt, not that Chriſt had any ſins of his owne, but that ours were ſo layd vpon him, and he ſo made ſatiſfaction to God for them, as if they had bene his owne. Surely, ſaith the Prophet, He hath 
                        Iſaiah 53. 4. 
                        borne Our infirmities, and caryed Our ſorrowes, yet We did iudge him as plagued and ſmitten of GOD, and humbled: That is, wée iudged euill, as though hée were puniſhed for his owne ſinnes, and not for ours. But hee 
                        5. 
                        was wounded for Our tranſgreſſions, he was broken for Our iniquites, the chaſteſment of Our peace was vpon him, and with his ſtripes We are healed.
                     
                     3 When it is ſaid, Aaron lift vp his hand and bleſſed

                         22. Wée muſt conſider, that héerein hée was plainly a Figure of Chriſt, who onely can bleſſe, béeing onely the ſéede of Abraham, In whom all the Nations of the world are bleſſed,
                         and in whom (ſaith Gen. 18. 18. Ephe. 1. 3. 
                        S. Paul, The Father hath bleſſed vs with all ſpirituall bleſſing in heauenly things: As with the bleſſing of Reconciliation to himſelfe, reputing vs now iuſt for his Sonne Chriſt, and Sonnes and Heires of all heauenly benefits: with the bleſſing of his Spirit, whereby wée walke in his calling, béeing guided and gouerned therby in the ſame: with the bleſſing of acceptance of all our workes (though full of imperfection and weakneſſe) and with this great bleſſing, That all aduerſitie becommeth

a helpe to vs, to draw vs to Heauen and eternall reſt, &amp;c. How are wée bound to loue ſuch a GOD? Let vs often fall into the reckoning of it, and riſe vp in thankefull ſpeaches and thoughts, as others of his ſeruants haue done before vs, vpon the ſame cauſe, Namely, Saint Auguſtin, whoſe wordes are theſe: Minus te amat, O Deus, qui aliquid tecum amat, quod non propter te amat. O GOD, hee loueth thee not as much as hee ſhould, who loueth any thing els but thee, which he loueth not for thee.
                         Saint Cyprian: Diſce nihil Deo praeponere, quia Deus nihiltibi praepoſuit; Learne (O man) to prefer nothing in thy loue before God, becauſe he hath preferred nothing before thee in his loue; No, no, not the life and blood of his owne deare and onely Sonne. Saint Bernard: Quando ignorabam, me inſtruxit; quando errabam, me reduxit; quando ſteti, me tenuit; quando cecidi, me erexit; quando veni, me ſuſcepit &amp;c: O quid retribuam? When I was ignorant, he inſtructed mee; when I erred, he reclaymed mee; when I ſtood, hee held me vp; when I fell, he rayſed me; when I came to him, he receiued me &amp;c, O what ſhould I giue to the Lord for theſe fauours? &amp;c.
                     
                     4 And the glory of the Lord appeared to all the people. 
                        Verſ. 23. 24. 
                        And there came a fire out from the Lord, and conſumed vpon the Altar the Burnt-offering, and the fat: which when all the people ſawe, they gaue thankes, and fell on their faces: (or, they gaue a ſhoute for ioy.) Thus did the Lord pleaſe to confirme both that maner of worſhipping him, by ſuch Sacrifices and the Miniſterie of Aaron, and his ſonnes now choſen and conſecrated to that Office. The like credite he gaue to Elias his Prophet, When fire from Heauen came downe, and conſumed the 
                        1. King 18. 38. 
                        Burnt-offering, and the wood, and the ſtones, and the duſt, &amp; licked vp the water that was in the ditch. Which the people
                         alſo ſawe, and there fell againe vpon their faces, 
                        39. 
                        and ſayd: The Lord He is GOD; The Lord Hee is GOD.
                         Againe, When Salomon had made an ende of 
                        2. Cro. 7. 1.
                        
                        praying, fire came downe from Heauen, and conſumed the Burnt-offering, and the Sacrifices, and the glory of the Lord filled the Houſe. Such mercie in the Lord to méete with mans weakeneſſe, is duely and carefully to bée thought of, all péeuiſh frowardneſſe to bée inſtructed and to beléeue, (as a moſt vnfit thing for any that looke for Heauen) to be abandoned and caſt away; Left after all meanes in mercie offered to winne vs and ſaue vs, wée be deſtroyed with ſome fearefull iudgement, that all the world may talke of vs for our obſtinacie. This (I ſay) becauſe euen this gracious God is the ſame to man, by his Holy-word and infinite fauours, ſéeking vs as loſt Shéepe to be wonne vnto him. Let vs read, let vs ſearch, let vs day and night indeuoure to know his holy Will; and then conſtantly and faithfully walke in the ſame, whileſt we haue a day to liue. This fire from Heauen did not plainlier confirme them, than the euidence of his Word doth all thoſe at this day, that will looke into it. And aſwell may we at this day fall vpon our faces, and giue a ſhoute in thankefulneſſe for the great glory of the ſame, in the Miniſterie of his Seruants indued with great gifts of knowledge and power to expound &amp; open the ſame vnto vs, as they did héere, or in other places, for ſuch viſible Leſtimonies of his approbation. God ſtrike vs, and worke with vs for his mercies ſake, that wée may liue and not die, prayſing and bleſſing his Name for euer, for his Godneſſe.

                        IN the former Chapter, hauing ſhewed verſe 13. by that miracle of fire frō heauen, how he accepteth of worſhip done according to his will; now in this, by a dreadfull iudgement vpon the two ſonnes of Aaron, he ſheweth how he abhorreth all preſumption of man, to ſerue him any other way. The ſinne and death of the young men for their ſinne, is layd-downe in theſe words, But Nadab and Abihu, the ſonnes of Aaron,
                         
                        Verſe 1. 
                        tooke either of them his Cenſar, and put fire therein, and put incenſe thereupon, and offered ſtrange fire before the Lord, which he had not commaunded them. Therefore a fire went out from the Lord, and deuoured them; ſo they 
                        2. Locum ſacrum etiam ingreſſi ſunt, quod ne ſummo quidē ſacerdoti licebat, niſi ſemel in anno. Tremelius.
                         
                        dyed before the Lord. Their ſinne was then, that to burne incenſe withall, they tooke not the fire from the Altar, of that which came downe from Heauen, and was preſerued by the diligence of the Prieſts, till the Captiuitie of Babilon, but other fire, which therefore is called ſtrange fire, becauſe it was not fire appointed and commaunded. Which fault in mans eyes may ſéeme to haue excuſe, ann not to deſerue ſo fearefull a puniſhment. For they were but yet gréene in their office, and ſo of ignorance might offend, being not yet well acquainted with the nature of their Office. Againe, of forgetfulneſſe they might offend, not remembring or thinking of the matter, as they ought. Thirdly, there was no malice in them, or purpoſe to doe euill, but wholly they aymed at Gods ſeruice, with a true meaning, although in the manner they miſſed ſomewhat. But all theſe and whatſoeuer like excuſes, were as figge-leaues before God, vaine and weake to defend them from

guiltineſſe, in the breach of his commaundement, and not withſtanding any ſuch, they are thus fearefully and dreadfully deuoured with fire from God, that they then, we no
                              •
                           , and all fleſh to the worlds end, might learne and ſettle in our hearts, two thinges. Firſt, with what ſeueritie the Lord challengeth &amp; defendeth his authoritie, in laying-downe the way and manner of his worſhip, not leauing it to any creature to meddle with, but according to preſcription and appointment from him; Content he is, that men ſhall make lawes for humane matters, concerning their worldly eſtate in this earth, as ſhalbe fitteſt for the place where they liue; lawes againſt murder, theft, oppreſſion &amp;c. but for his diuine worſhip he onlywill preſcribe it himſelfe, and what he appoynteth, that muſt be done, and that onely, or elſe Nadab and Abihu their puniſhment expected, that is, Gods wrath expected, in ſuch manner as he ſhall pleaſe. The Poynt is good to be carefully marked, and would god it might take full place in all hearts! The Scriptures are plaine, and they would be ſeriouſly thought of, you ſhall not doe euery man what ſeemeth good in his 
                        Deut. 12 8. &amp;c Deut. 4. 10.

                        10. 
                        was gathered to their fathers, there aroſe vp an other generatiō, which neither knew the Lord, nor yet the works which he had done for Iſraell, And theſe did wickedly in

Hee and his houſe periſhed for worſhipping God otherwiſe, than God himſelfe appointed. This is no ſmall puniſhment, if God giue a heart to thinke of it fruitfully. The like you read of Saul who would offer ſacrifice contrary to the word, He and his houſe alſo periſh for it. Ieroboams golden Calues 1.

Judge then in your ſecret thought, hearing theſe words, whether it be a ſmall matter, to worſhip God otherwiſe than he in his word appointeth to vs. It is a very memorable Note. thing, that is written of Gregorie ſometimes Byſhop of Rome,

                         ſet downe in the Letanie, hauing for it neither commandement, nor example, nor any warrant in the word, but all to the contrary very plainly, and that ſo God reuenged this wicked boldneſſe, as in one

houre, foureſcore of thoſe that ſo prayed and rehearſed thoſe ſuffrages, ſuddenly fell to the earth, and breathed out their laſt breath. Thus the Lord liketh deuiſes of men in his ſeruice. Why ſhould not all fleſh be reſolued then, that, in vaine doe wee worſhip God, teaching for 
                        Mat. 15. 5. 
                        doctrine, mens precepts? And conſequently, of the impudencie of that ſpeach of a Popiſh Doctor, that, GOD reſpecteth not ſo much what we doe, as with what minde wee doe it.
                         The vntaught Romanes vnderſtood more trueth than this man, when béeing mooued to receiue Chriſt into the number of their gods, they anſwered, that euery God muſt needes bee ſerued according to his will, and not according to his worſhippers will; and therefore ſince they vnderſtood that Chriſt would haue no fellowes, but would be worſhipped alone, they muſt needes either forgot all their other Gods, which they might not doe, or worſhip him otherwiſe than his will was, which would offend him. So they reſolued to reiect him, which turned to the deſtruction of them in the ende. Diſcamus Deum, ex ipſius voluntate, honorare, &amp;c, Let vs learne to worſhip God according to his VVill,
                         ſaith S. Chryſoſtome, &amp;c. Cyprian telleth vs, VVe muſt follow 
                        
                           Cypr. lib. 2. Epiſt. 3. contra Aquarios. 1. Cor. 11. 23. Coloſſ. 2. 22. 23. Ʋatablus in Annot: in Deut: 4. 
                        Chriſt, &amp; he that doth not ſo, is not a Prieſt of God, but walketh in darkneſſe. Paul
                         ſaith, Hee deliuered to them what he had receiued, &amp;c: Hée condemned all voluntarie worſhip. A learned Profeſſor in Paris
                         affirmeth boldly, that mens praecepts turne people from the truth, &amp; ſeduce the hearts of the ſimple: therefore (ſaith he) God tyeth vs ſo ſtrictly to his Word without adding or diminiſhing, &amp;c.
                        
                     
                     2 But doth not a good intent and meaning preuaile Good intent: with God, albeit the thing be not expreſly warranted? Your ſelfe iudge, by that which you ſée here, and in many other Scriptures, making this the ſecond of the two things, I ſaid were here to be obſerued. Had Nadab and Abihu the ſonnes of Aaron héere, any ill meaning towards God, or did they of malicious purpoſe offend

                        him, and procure their owne deſtruction? No, you muſt néedes thinke their intent, was good, but becauſe they ſwarued from the word, that good intent ſerued not. The words out of Deutro. cited before, are not, you ſhall not do ill in your owne eyes, but you ſhall not doe 
                        Deut. 12. 8. 
                        that which ſeemeth good, good
                         I ſay, and I pray you marke it, you ſhal not do that, but ſhall kéepe you to my commandement. Be it neuer ſo good then in my conceite, that is, be my meaning neuer ſo good, it profiteth not, neither ſhall excuſe Gods deſtroying wrath, more than it did here theſe ſonnes of Aaron. There is a way 
                        Prou 14. 12. ſaith Salomon, that ſeemeth good to a man and right, but theyſſues thereof are the wayes of death. Such aſſuredly are all wil worſhips, not grounded vpon the word, but vpon mans will, and good intent. They ſhall excommunicate you (ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt) Yea, the time
                         
                        Iohn 16. 2. 
                        ſhall come, that whoſoeuer killeth you will thinke that hee doth God good ſeruice. What then? ſhall his ſo thinking excuſe his bloody murder? Ioſeph had no ill meaning, when hée prayed his Father, to change his Gen. 48. 18. hand, and to lay his right hand vpon his elder ſonnes head. What ill meant Ioſua when hée wiſhed Moſes to Numb. 11. 28. Iudg. 17. 3. 1. Sam. 15. 15. Matth. 16. 22. Luk. 18. 15. Luk. 9. 54. Iohn 13. 8. 
                        forbid thoſe that prophecied? Michas mother when according to her vow, ſhée made her ſonnes two Idoles. Saul when he ſaued aliue the ſhéepe of the Amalekites, &amp;c. Peter when he had Chriſt, his Maſter, to pitie himſelfe. The Diſciples of Chriſt when they forbadde little Children to come vnto him, when they would haue commanded that fire ſhould come from Heauen, &amp;c. Peters meaning had no hurt in it, when he forbad Chriſt to waſh his feete: with a number like places in Scripture: yet you know no good intent was accepted in theſe caſes. No more, no more ſhall it euer be, when it is not agréeing to the VVord, which onely is a Chriſtian man and womans true and perfect guide. Let therefore theſe things take place with vs, and neuer

wroſtle we againſt the Lord, for he is too ſtrong for vs. and his will muſt ſtand, not ours. O why ſhould it grieue mée to be ruled by his word, ſéeing it is ſo ſure a way for mée to walke in? Or why ſhould any Teacher deliuer to me, that which hée neuer receiued of God, to be deliuered to his people? If they craue obedience, why ſhould they bée angry, that I pray to haue it ſhewed out of his word, whom onely I muſt obey? Hée hath preſcribed a forme of ſeruing him, that forme hée will accept and bleſſe with eternall peace; all other formes hée will abhorre and puniſh. Nadab and Abihu preach ſo vnto vs and all fleſh. They wiſh vs to take héed by their harme: God is in other things full of patience, but in this, he is full of wrath, and his authoritie, to appoint his owne worſhip, he will not indure it to be taken from him by any man. Let Popiſh whiſperers then, make good out of Gods word Latine Prayers
                         when we vnderſtand no Latin, Calling vpon Saints
                         that heare vs not; Flying from the ſufficiencie of Chriſts Paſſion, to our owne merits, croſſings and creepings, with a thouſand deuiſed toyes, and we will obey them. But if they cannot, let them leaue vs to ſerue God, according to his word, that we may bée accepted.
                     3 You may alſo well note it here, that Nadab &amp; Abihu, were two of Aarons eldeſt ſonnes, which after their father ſhould in his place haue ſuccéeded him, yet there is no mercie with God, to ſtay his iudgement, when they will not be ruled by his word. No prerogatiue therefore of any man, ſhall ſaue him from wrath, if hee thus offend, but the eldeſt ſhall die, aſwell as a yonger, the richeſt aſwell as the poorer, a great man or woman aſwell as a ſmall. There is no regard with God of theſe things But the ſoule that ſerueth him according to his owne will reueiled in his VVord, that is regarded, and euer déere vnto him, &amp;c. Build we not therefore, vpon any titles, and ſo ſwarue from the rule laid downe vnto

vs. If ſo little a tranſgreſſion cannot be qualified any way, by any circumſtance; O what will bée their caſe one day, that ſo many wayes ſtray from the Law of God,
                         and almoſt in no one iote of their worſhip, haue any warrant? Thinke with your ſelf more of this matter, and meditate further of it at your times.
                     4 Then Moſes ſaid vnto Aaron, This is that the
                         
                        Verſe. 3. 
                        Lord ſpake, ſaying, I will be ſanctified in them that come neere mee, and before all the people I will be glorified.
                         You can conceiue what wo it was to Moſes, to ſée this end of two of his brothers ſonnes, but he muſt ſtoope to God, and ſo he doth, telling Aaron the trueth of the fault, and ſo conſequently defending God, that he did but iuſtly. In déede (ſaith he) we muſt confeſſe that this is that we were told before, how God will be ſanctified in them that come neere vnto him:
                         that is, how he will haue his Law obeyed and followed in his worſhip, and not any way elſe, how though he vſe the Miniſterie of man, yet no man liuing muſt be wiſer than Hee, to ſwarue from the forme appointed, and to follow his owne libertie, but man muſt thinke it his wiſedome, to doe as God biddeth, &amp;c.
                     5 But Aaron held his peace, (ſaith the Text) that is, Verſe. 3. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         was ſo aſtoniſhed with the fearefulnes of it, that he had no ſpéech, but all amazed and ſhaken with the woe of it, held his peace. He howled not out with any vnſé
                           •
                        mly cries, neither vttered any words of rage and impatiencie, but méekly ſtooped to Gods will, kiſſed his rodde, and held his peace. If thus Aaron in ſo great a iudgement, how much more we, when our friends dye naturally, ſwéetly, and comfortably, ſo that we may boldly ſay, Nō amiſimus, ſedpraemiſimus; VVe haue not loſt them, but ſent them before vs,
                         whether we our ſelues hope to follow. Lay to this heauie harted father, yet ſilent and patient, the example of olde father Elye
                         the Prieſt, to whom when Samuel had related ſuch fearefull things,

quietly he anſwered. It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth 
                        1. Sam. 3. 18. 
                        him good. The example alſo of Dauid, who in his diſtreſſe very bitter and heauie, yet notably ſaid, Let 
                        2. Sam. 15. 26. 
                        the Lord doe to me as ſeemeth good in his eyes. Theſe are moſt excellent Paterns for vs to follow in all our croſſes and griefes, not forgetting that golden Saying of Iob, Wee haue taken good things at Gods hands, and
                         
                        Iob. 2. 10. Iob. 1. 21. 
                        ſhall we not take euill? O yes, yes, The Lord giueth, and the Lord taketh, and euer, euer, bleſſed be his Name
                         for all. The fiſh groweth greater in ſalt waters, and the Lord for his mercie make our Faith, Pacience, and Comfort in him great, in the ſalteſt and bittereſt waters of this world. Amen.
                     
                     6 Obſerue here againe with your ſelfe, the ſtrange and admirable change of theſe worldly matters, in the turne, (as we ſay) of a hand. For but Yeſterday (as it were) Aaron and theſe ſonnes of his had a famous and glorious conſecration, into the greateſt and higheſt dignitie vpon earth, (nothing vnder the Sunne being more glorious than that Prieſt-hood in thoſe dayes) And how may you thinke his heart reioyced to ſée, not onely himſelfe, but his children, (which Parents often loue more than themſelues) ſo bleſſed and honoured? But, O change now ſudden and fearefull! O fickle fading comfort that man taketh hold of in this world, whatſoeuer it be, if wordly: Theſe ſonnes ſo lately exalted and honoured to their old Fathers ſwéet and great ioy, now lye deſtroyed before his face, to his extréeme and twitching torment. And how? Not by any ordinarie and accuſtomed death, but by fire from Heauen, a ſore and dreadfull iudgement. For what alſo? Euen for breach of commaunded dutie by the Lord, all which doubled and trebled the fathers ſorrow. As it did in Dauid when his ſonne Abſolon died not an vſual death, and in rebellion and diſebedience againſt his king and Father. You remember his paſſion then vttered. O my 
                        2. Sam. 18. 33.
                        
                        ſonne Abſolon, my ſonne, my ſonne Abſolon; would God I had died for thee, O Abſolon, my ſonne, my ſonne. He conſidered the cauſe wherein he dyed, &amp; the manner how he dyed; to a father ſo kinde as Dauid was, both of them full of woe and ſorrow. Let neuer therefore any proſperitie in this world puffe vs: for wée little know, what to morrow-day may bring with it; The glaſſe that gliſtereth moſt, is ſooneſt broken; the rankeſt corne is ſooneſt layd, and the fulleſt bough with pleaſant fruite is ſooneſt ſlit, hauing more eyes vpon it, &amp; moe ſtones caſt at it, than all the other boughs of the trée. Pleaſant wine maketh wiſe men fooles, and fooles often ſtarke mad. Thouſands fall at the left hand, but tenne 
                        Pſal. 91. 7. 
                        thouſand at the right. Multos frāgit aduerſitas, ſed plures extollit proſperitas: Many (ſaith Saint Bernard,) are cruſhed 
                        Bernard. 
                        with aduerſitie, but more are puffed vp by proſperitie. Lacertus Milonem perdidit, ambitio Caeſarem. Nimis alter Naturae, nimis alter Fortunae credidit. Milo his ſtrong arme ouerthrew him, and Caeſar his ambition. The one truſted too much to Nature, and the other to Fortune. As a Spiders webbe; ſo is a mans greatnes in this world, ſoone wiped away with a little whiſke. Often therefore thinke of Saint Iohns words: Loue not this world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man loue 
                        1. Iohn 2. 15. 
                        this world, the loue of the Father is not in him. For all 
                        16. 
                        that is in this world (as the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life) is not of the Father, but is of the world. And this world paſſeth away, and the luſt therof: 
                        17. 
                        but hee that fulfilleth the Will of GOD abideth for euer.
                     
                     7 But was Aaron hated of God, becauſe this fearefull happe fell vpon his Children? No, no. Therefore learne to ſtay your haſtie nature from iudging raſhly, and bée not caryed away by a pratling world. Euer remember what Croſſe is layd héere, not vpon a meane man in the Church, but vpon him that had the higheſt

place, that was a Figure of Chriſt,
                         and accepted of him, and meditate of it much with your ſelfe for your comfort &amp;c.
                     8 Note in the 4. and 5. verſes, the maner of bury all, 
                        Verſe 4. 5. 
                        not in the Hoſte, but without in the fields prepared and kept for ſuch vſe. Where was then ye ſuperſtitious conceite of Churches and Church-yards? Their friendes and kinſ-men cary them foorth to buriall, and the cuſtome is ſtill commendable amongſt vs.
                     9 After Moſes ſaid vnto Aaron and vnto Eleazar and 
                        Verſe. 6. 
                        Ithamar his ſonnes; vncouer not your heads, neither rent your clothes leaſt yee die, and leſt wrath come vpon all the people; but let your brethren, all the Houſe of Iſraell bewayle the burning which the Lord hath kindled.
                         In this caſe it was not lawfull for Aaron and his ſonnes to mourne, leaſt they ſhould ſéeme to preferre their carnal affection to God his iuſt iudgement. And it is a great Caueat to all ſuch, as deſire to gouerne themſelues in an acceptable courſe. Of mourning for the dead, and the maner of Nations differing in the ſame, more may be ſaid in the 19. Chapter.
                     
                     10 But the people here might mourne, that it might euer be learned, noted, and remembred, how néerely and truely the griefe of the Miniſter ſhould touch a louing and godly people. But where, where is ſuch a people? God forbid but wée ſhould aſſure our ſelues, there is a portion that doth thus, although al that reape the labours aſwell as they, dee it not. And let it bée a faithfull Miniſters comfort euer, that mee loue him, and ſuffer with him in any griefe of his, than hée knoweth off. I know what I ſay, and my ſoule bleſſeth the Lord for my experience in this poynt. My infirmities are many, and my weakneſſe to doe ſeruice hath euer béene great, I know it, I acknowledge it in humilitie before him that knoweth, whether I lye, or no. Yet hath it béene his good pleaſure, euer ſince I was firſt a

                        Miniſter, to ſhew himſelfe ſtrong in my weakneſſe, and to giue a gracious bleſſing to my poore Labours in diuers places, that I might well learne, it is all one to him to worke with ſmall gifts and with great. And touching the thing I ſpake of, I haue found this loue in ſome for my onely Miniſterie ſake, that I haue béene aduertiſed by writing, of matters much concerning mée, and to this day could neuer learne and know who they were. The Lord reward it ten thouſand folde into their boſomes, if they bée liuing, and vpon theirs, if they be gone to God. Thus much breaketh from mée in this place out of a thankfull heart to GOD, and to them; and for a true comfort to my Brethren in this Land, lighting vpon theſe my weake labours; that beſides their owne experience, they know alſo mine, that howſoeuer all are not kinde and louing, where wée liue and labour, yet more are our faithfull friends than wée know. And therefore let vs goe on through all reports 
                        2. Cor. 6. 8. 
                        good and bad, and through all croſſes great and ſmall: doe the worke whereunto wée are called, and reſt vpvpon him that will neuer faile vs nor let vs fall.
                     11 And they did according to Moſes commandement, 
                        Verſe 7. ſaith the Text. So will the rod of God waken his people and worke obedience. For which cauſe the Lord often layeth it where hée loueth, not willing, as himſelfe ſaith, the death of a ſinner, but rather that hee may 
                        Ezek. 18. 32 
                        turne and liue.
                     
                     12 Thou ſhalt not drink wine nor ſtrong drinke, thou, 
                        Verſ. 9. 
                        nor thy ſonnes with thee, when yee come into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, leſt yee die: This is an Ordinance for euer throughout your Generations. That yee 
                        10. 
                        may put difference betwixt the holy and the vnholy, and betweene the cleane and the vncleane: And that yee may teach the Children of Iſrael all the Statutes which the 
                        21. 
                        Lord hath commanded them by the hand of Moſes. Sobrietie
                         is a vertue fit for all men, but eſpecially for Miniſters
                        
of the Word and Sacraments. Thus much in this Law the Lord ſhadowed, and wée may truely learne, wine was forbidden them abſolutely, when their turne came to miniſter: but now, that Law bindeth not. Yet to Sobrietie, with wine, and without wine, we are euer bound. Let a Miniſter (ſaith the Apoſtle) be no drinker 
                        1. Tim. 3. 3. 
                        of wine, meaning diſorderly and vnfitly, for otherwiſe Timothie is exhorted to drinke a little wine for his ſtomacke-ſake, Chap. 5. 23. Ephe. 5. 18. and his often infirmities. To all men the ſame Apoſtle ſaith againe: Bee not drunke with wine 
                        Vinum eſt blandus daemon, dulce venenum, ſuaue peccatum, quo qui delectatur, non facit peccatum, ſed totus eſt peccatū. Auguſt.
                         
                        wherein is exceſſe, but bee fullfilled with the ſpirit, &amp;c. The reaſon added, that thus they might be ſound and ſincere Interpreters of the Law. For the chiefe Office of the Prieſts, was not to kill beaſtes and offer Sacrifices, but to haue knowledge, and to teach the people the difference betwixt the true God and falſe Idolles, betwixt holy things and prophane, betwixt right prayer and wrong, concerning the Law and ſinne, and grace, &amp;c. according to the Prophet Malachies
                         Speach: The lippes of the Priest ſhall keepe knowledge and they ſhall ſeeke 
                        Malach. 2. 7. 
                        the Law at his mouth, for he is the Meſſenger of the Lord of Hostes.
                         But here is no thought in this Law of any proud and Anabaptiſticall ſeparation of our ſelues from the fellowſhippe of our Brethren, and the vnitie of the Church, vnder a colour that wée are holy and others prophane. Beware we euer of ſuch Doctrine, and ſuch Teachers.
                     13 Then Moſes ſaid to Aaron and vnto Eleazar and 
                        Verſe 12. 
                        Ithamar his ſonnes that were left, Take the Meat-offering, &amp;c.
                         This is added to comfort and ſtrengthen the ſhaken hearts of Aaron and his liuing ſonnes, who might by this ſtrange puniſhment haue béene driuen into doubt, whether euer the Lord would bée pleaſed, that they ſhould meddle againe with the Sacrifices. And we ſée therein a ſwéete and gracious God, who maketh not his promiſes voyd to all, for the faults of ſome, but only

teacheth, to beware by other mens harmes. Wée muſt therefore cleaue to our Calling, and euen ſo much the more painfully goe forward therein, by how much wée ſée others puniſhed for ill-doing. There is as certaine reward with GOD for well-dooing, as there is puniſhment for the contrary. Be taught therefore (I ſay) and ſchooled, but neuer be diſcouraged and feared from impoſed duetie.
                     14 And Moſes ſought the Goate that was offered 
                        Verſe 16. 
                        for ſinne, and loe it was burned; therefore hee was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar the ſonnes of Aaron, which were left aliue, &amp;c. Part of this Goate being a Sinne-offering, ſhould haue béene eaten, I meane, the ſhoulder and breſt alotted to the Prieſt, but it was all burned contrary to the Law. For which Moſes was iuſtly offended, hauing ſéen ſo lately Gods wrath vpon the other fault. The anſwere of Aaron you haue in the 19. verſe, 
                        Verſe 19. in effect and ſenſe, as if hée ſhould haue ſaid. I confeſſe and acknowledge the Ordinance of God is to be kept, and wée are to eate with ioy of the parts alotted vnto vs of the Sacrifice for ſinne, the blood whereof was not brought into the Tabernacle of the Teſtimonie.
                         But how could I eate with ioy, in ſo heauie and wofull a caſe of my children? Compelled therefore with the greatneſſe of my griefe, I did what I did &amp;c. At which anſwere, ſayeth your Chapter, Moſes was content, ſo Verſ. 20. bearing with his infirmitie, conſidering his great ſorrow, but not leauing an example to forgiue them that maliciouſly tranſgreſſe the commandement of God. And as Moſes is ſaid to haue ſtayed his anger, ſo you ſée the Lord himſelfe did, not puniſhing againe this fault. It layeth open vnto vs the great kindneſſe of our gracious God, of whom the Pſalme ſaith, He is full of compaſſion 
                        Pſal. 103. 8. 
                        and mercie, long ſuffering and of great goodneſſe. He will not alway be chiding, neither keepeth hee his anger for euer. He dealeth not with vs after our ſinnes: neither 
                        9. 10.
                        
                        rewardeth vs according to our wickedneſſe, &amp;c. Secondly, you may ſée here, how theſe Ceremoniall Lawes 
                        1 Sam. 21. 6. Mat. 12. 4. gaue place to neceſſitie, as Dauid alſo in neceſſitie did eate the Shew-bread, which was otherwiſe vnlawfull for him to doe: and Ezechias admitted to the Paſſeouer thoſe that were not clenſed. But for Morall Lawes, there is no diſpenſation for corporall neceſſity, but a conſtant courſe muſt be held in obeying them. For it is not neceſſarie that I ſhould liue, but it is euer neceſſarie that I ſhould liue righteouſly. Laſtly, in that Moſes admitted a reaſonable excuſe, wée may learne to abhorre pride, and to doe the like. Pride I ſay, which ſcorneth to heare what may be ſaid againſt the conceit we haue once harboured. A modeſt man or woman doth not thus. But euen for his ſeruant and his mayde, holy Iob had an Iob. 31. 13. eare, and did not deſpiſe their iudgement, their complaint or griefe, when they thought themſelues euill intreated by him. The example of God himſelfe is in ſtead of a thouſand, who mercifully both heard and accepted of Abimelech his excuſe for taking away Abrahā
                         his wife. I know (ſaith he) that thou didſt it euen with 
                        Gen. 20. 6. 
                        an vpright-minde, and therfore I kept thee alſo that thou ſhouldeſt not ſinne againſt mee, &amp;c. Shall the Lord bée thus ſwéet, and we ſo dogged, ſo churliſh, ſo ſterne, and ſower, that no excuſe may ſerue for a thing done amiſſe, if once wée haue taken notice of it? Beware, beware, and remember your owne frailtie well. A ſtubborne frowardneſſe hath hurt many, ſwéete gentleneſſe and curteſie neuer any, but though wicked men were vnthankfull, yet our gracious God was pleaſed. And thus of this Chapter.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. XI.
                     
                        IT belonged to the Prieſts Office in thoſe dayes not onely to teach True Doctrine
                         to the people, to pray for them, and to offer Sacrifices appointed by God, but alſo to diſcerne and iudge betwixt things cleane and vncleane. Therefore hauing hitherto ſpoken of Sacrifices and the Ceremonies therof, now Moſes commeth to ſpeake of vncleane things: Namely, Men and Women vncleane, Meates vncleane, Houſes, Garments, Marriages, and ſuch like, directing the Prieſt how hée ſhould iudge in this behalſe truely, neither make that vncleane which was not, nor that cleane which God made vncleane. This Chapter which now you read, ſpeaketh of vncleane meates, beaſtes, Fiſhes, 
                        The ſumme of the Chapter. and Birdes. Whereof, before wée conſider according to the Text, wée may all remember the ſtate of this matter, concerning difference of meate as in the Scripture wée are taught. Firſt then, in Geneſis you read thus, Behold, I haue giuen vnto you euery herbe bearing ſeed, 
                        Gen. 1. 29. 
                        which is vpon all the earth, which hath life in it ſelfe, euery greene herbe ſhall be for meate, and it was ſo. No fleſh as yet then granted to man. In the 9 Chapter you read thus. Euery thing that moueth, &amp; liueth, ſhal be meat for 
                        Gen. 9. 3. 
                        you, euen as the greene herbe haue I giuen you all things. But fleſh with the life thereof, I meane with the blood 
                        4 
                        thereof, ſhall yee not eate &amp;c. Héere is fleſh granted alſo as well as herbes, and onely the blood thereof excepted. But now in this Chapter of Leuiticus,
                         many ſorts of meates are forbidden as vnclean. Was this perpetuall? No, it was but Ceremoniall, and for a time. Wherfore the Apoſtle was bold to ſay in his time, and for all

times after. Let no man condemne you in meate and 
                        Coloſſ. 2. 16. 
                        drinke, or in reſpect of an holy day, or of the New Moore, or of the Sabboth dayes, which are but a ſhadow of things to come, but the body is Chriſt. And whereof a ſhadow? Firſt, theſe things ſhadowed the dutie of mā, to depend vpon the word and will of his God in all things, yea, euen in his meate. Secondly, how carefull hée ought to be to ſéeke cleanenes of body and ſoule before the Lord, and to auoyd the contrary, which by the fall of our firſt Parents, was and is ſo crept into all their poſteritie, Eſay. 64. 6. as now our very righteouſneſſe, that is, our beſt things are but as a foule, filthy, ſtayned cloth. Thirdly, how God had made a difference betwixt them, and all other the Nations of the world, reputing them in his mercy Deut. 14. 1. 2. as cleane, and all other people as vncleane, that is, accepting them for his People before all others. Remember the Uiſion of Peter, in the Acts; and the meaning of Act. 10. 15. it, Namely, that Peter ſhould not forbeare to goe to the Gentiles, in reſpect of any former difference betwixt Iewe and Gentile, for this ſhould bée to call that vncleane, which God had made cleane. God now had broken downe by his ſonnes Paſſion, the partition wall, 
                        Ephe. 2. 14. and Gentile aſwell as Iewe ſhould be accepted, the Ceremonie of thoſe meates cleane and vncleane, which ſhadowed out this partition and difference, now hauing his ende and béeing finiſhed. Kill and eate (now) of all Act. 10. 13. Mat. 28. 19. 
                        meates; and Goe, and teach (now) all Nations: Call not any meate (now) any more vncleane, for all is cleane to 
                        Tit. 1. 15. 
                        them that are cleane: And put no difference (now) betwixt Cornelius and a Iewe, for all are cleane: that is, In euery Nation hee that feareth God, and worketh righteouſneſſe
                         
                        Act. 10. 35. 
                        is accepted. In the Goſpell therefore, there is now no difference of meates, but all meate frée with 1. Tim. 4. 4. Matth. 15. 11. 
                        Thankſ-giuing. That which goeth into the mouth defileth not the man, but that which commeth out of the mouth, that defileth the man: ſaith our true Teacher,

Chriſt Ieſus, and wée muſt marke it. His Apoſtle (after Rom. 14. 14. him) Saint Paul, I know and am perſwaded through the Lord Ieſus, that there is nothing vncleane of it ſelfe; but vnto him that iudgeth any thing vncleane, to him it is vncleane. Whatſoeuer therefore is ſold in the Shambles, eat 1. Cor. 10. 25. 1. Tim. 4. 1. &amp;c. 
                        yee, and aske no queſtion for conſcience ſake. Neuertheleſſe there ſhall come in the latter dayes ſome that ſhall forbid to marry, and command to abſtaine from meates which God hath created to bee receiued with Thanks-giuing. For it is ſanctified by the Word of God, and Prayer. But theſe forbidders and commanders, are departed from the Faith: giue heed vnto the ſpirits of errour, and doctrines of Deuils. They ſpeake lyes through hypocriſie, and they haue their conſciences burned with an hot iron. O note theſe things earneſtly with your ſelfe, and acknowledge Gods goodneſſe in thus plainly fore-warning vs long before, of that which wée ſée in theſe dayes fulfilled. Vnto the pure (ſaith the ſame Apoſtle) 
                        Tit. 1. 15. 
                        all things are pure; but vnto them that are defiled and vnbeleeuing, nothing is pure, but euen their minds and conſciences are defiled, &amp;c. That Commandement to abſtayne from things offered to Idolles, and from blood: In the Acts of the Apostles, was but for a time, and is ended alſo in Chriſt, or els it was no Ceremonial law. But Acts 15. 20. you thinke per aduenture with your ſelfe, may not the Church in theſe dayes alſo forbid ſome kinde of meate as fleſh, &amp;c? The anſwere is, that cauſe and circumſtance muſt bée conſidered, Ciuilie the Magiſtrate may, that is, for the good of the Common-wealth, in maintaining Mariners for ſeruice, in helping ye yong bréed of Cattle that victual may be more cheape, by ſparing the eating for a time, and ſo foorth, but not for Religion and Conſcience, as if one meate pleaſed God more than another: for (as you heard) Peters ſheete with all ſorts 
                        Act. 10. Coloſſ. 2. 20. &amp;c. 
                        of meates confuteth that; many other Scriptures alſo, which yo
                           •
                         may read your ſelfe ouer. But what if one

pretend the Magiſtates law being indéed popiſh, and making Rom. 14. 17. Heb. 13. 9. difference of meates for religion? You muſt néedes confeſſe ſuch an one is an Hypocrite, and therefore odious to God, who hateth hypocriſie, and cannot be mocked. And what if hée do it in déede for Religion? Then hée denyeth in effect, that Chriſt is yet come, and hath taken away this Ceremoniall Law of vncleane meates, 
                        Gal. 5. 2. and as the Apoſtle ſaith, of Circumciſion, that if we be circumciſed now, Christ profiteth nothing; ſo is it true alſo, that if wée yet hold a difference of meates for Religion and Conſcience, Chriſt to vs is no Chriſt, and wée ſhall periſh. What if I ſincerly in regard of the Magiſtrates Ciuill Law, for the good of the Land, forbeare to eate any fleſh vpon times named by Law, yet well knowing my libertie in Chriſt? You doe moſt well, and would God the Land had more of theſe, that would obey godly Lawes according to their meaning, and abandon all ſinfull ryot and libertie contrary to them. GOD ſhould bée pleaſed, the Magiſtrate pleaſed, our Countrie profited, and wée knowen to God and man for people of g
                           •
                        ouernment and order.
                     2 But how did God in this Law of his, call that vncleane which himſelfe had made and ſaw to be good, as 
                        Gen. 1. 31. 
                        all his workes were good? Surely, in reſpect of Creation, and of themſelues nothing is euill or vncleane, but in reſpect of vſe forbidden, as God hath libertie to forbid at his good pleaſure, without impeachment of himſelfe, or of his Creature; Euen as the Tree of Knowledge of 
                        Gen: 2. 17. 
                        good and euill hurt not of it ſelfe, or the apple, but the tranſgreſſion after Commandement, the thing in it ſelfe good, but the vſe forbidden. If you ſay, that which 
                        Mat: 15. 11. 
                        goeth into the mouth defileth not, and therefore not the apple; it is true, for the apple defiled not, but the breach of Gods Commandement, You ſhall not eate: So that Rom. 14. 17. euer it was true, The Kingdome of GOD is not meate or drinke, &amp;c.
                     
                     
                        
3 How were beaſtes called vncleane in the time of Noah, when they entred into the Arke before this Law was made, except of themſelues and their Nature, they were ſo? I anſwere you truely, they were then ſo called, not in reſpect of any fault in themſelues, or of eating, but in regard of the Sacrifices, from which God did then exclude them, as here hée did from being eaten. And aſ well might God then, at his good pleaſure, chooſe what he would haue offered for Sacrifice, and what not; as now what he would haue eaten, and what not; all being his, and his prer
                           •
                        gatiue to doe with his owne as hée pleaſeth. As now therefore, that which was forbidden to be meat, is called vncleane, yet not ſo in Nature, but in regard of vſe therof forbidden; ſo then, was that called vncleane, which was forbidden to be Sacrificed, and not for any euill nature at the Creation, but only becauſe of this prohibition of vſe that way. Now let vs a little looke at the words of the Chapter.
                     
                     1 In the Chapter you ſée three ſorts Namely beaſts, of the Land, Fiſhes of the Sea, and Foules of the Ayre, and theſe are diſtinguiſhed or noted by Names; and by Signes. The Names that are héere ſet downe, Wée are not ſo well acquainted with ſome of them, becauſe in thoſe Eaſt-parts, there were diuers creatures not knowne to vs in theſe Countries, by their Names. The Beaſts. 
                        Signes therfore is the beſt note for vs, and in the beaſts they are theſe, diuiding the hoofe, and chewing the 
                        Verſe. 3. 
                        cudde, for ſo ſaith the Text. Whatſoeuer parteth the hoofe, and is clouen footed, and cheweth the cudde amongſt the beaſts, that ſhall ye eate. But if hée did the one, and not the other, or neither, hée was vncleane; Read the words your ſelfe. You ſaw before that theſe were but ſhadowes of other things. For doth God
                         regard Oxen, (ſaith the Apoſtle) and careth hée for diuiding, or not diuiding the hoofe, chewing, or not chewing 
                           
                              〈◊〉
                            Cor. 9. 9. 
                        the cudde: who made them all as they are, and

could haue made them all of one ſort, otherwiſe than héereby to reſemble berter matters? No. And therefore conſider with your ſelfe, that in this difference of beaſtes, the Lord ſhadowed
                         out a difference of men and women in this world, ſome cleane, and ſome vncleane. The cleane beaſtes reſemble the Godly and Elect which being clenſed by Faith
                         in Chriſt from their ſinnes, and ſanctified by the Spirit of GOD,
                         earneſtly and feruently loue the Word of God,
                         heare it, learne it, embrace it, Night and Day meditate of it, labouring to kéepe it by framing all their words and works, counſailes and actions according to it. The vncleane beaſts reſemble the wicked and reprobate that deſpiſe the Word, and liue as the Dogge that returneth to his vomit, Or the Swine 
                        2. Pet. 2. 22. 
                        that walloweth in the myre, that is, wickedly, filthily, and beaſtly. This taught Irenaeus many yeares agoe, Irenaeus lib. 5. and both for his antiquitie and worthineſſe let vs marke his words. They that haue the Pledge of the Spirit,
                         (ſaith hée) and ſerue the concupiſcence of the fleſh, but ſubiect themſelues to the Spirit, and reaſonably behaue themſelues in all things, rightly of the Apoſtle are called ſpirituall, becauſe the Spirit of GOD dwelleth in them. And they that caſt away the Counſaile of the Spirit, and ſerue the pleaſures of the fleſh, liuing vnreaſonably, and vnbridledly, following their ſinfull deſires, hauing no working of the Spirit, but liuing as dogges or ſwine, rightly hee calleth carnall becauſe they ſauour of nothing but the fleſh. And the Prophets, for the ſelfe ſame cauſe, compared them to bruite and vnreaſonable beasts, as to fed-Horſes neighing after their Neighbours wiues, &amp;c.
                         
                        Ier. 5. 8. Pſa. 49. 20. 
                        Dauid alſo in the Pſalme. Man being in honour hath no vnderſtanding, but is compared to the beaſts that periſh, &amp;c. Now all theſe things are done Figuratiuely, to note cleane and vncleane perſons as before. For they that haue a true Faith, and a good life, by meditating in the Word, are ſuch as diuide the hoofe, and chew the cudde, and they are cleane.

                           Such doe neither or but the one, are vncleane, as hee that beleeueth in GOD, but liueth not well, or hee that liueth in an outward honeſtie, but beleeueth nor rightly; hee alſo that doth neither liue well nor beleeue well, all theſe are vncleane. The Iewes, (ſaith this Father) may be ſayd in ſome ſort to chewe the cudde, becauſe they read the Scriptures, but they diuide not the hoofe, becauſe they beleeue not in the Sonne of GOD, Chriſt Ieſus, as well as in the Father.
                         To this effect Irenaeus. Others haue by cleane beaſts parting the hoofe, noted the true Teachers of the Word, which diuide the ſame aright, the Lawe and the Goſpell, Praecepts and promiſes, &amp;c.
                     
                     They againe, ſay others, may be well called cleane, diuiding the hoofe, who doe not beléeue in great or in groſſe, but diſcerne and diſtinguiſh things, as Chriſt, and Moſes; Nature and Grace; Truth and falſhood, &amp;c. 
                        Iohn 4. 1. 
                        Not beleeuing euery ſpirit but trying the Spirits whether they be of God or no. Things may not bée taken euer litterally; And againe, we may not be too bold with Myſteries and Allegories, leauing the letter, but a true wiſedome is to be prayed for, and vſed in both. Hee that is 
                        1. Cor. 2. 15. 
                        ſpirituall (ſaith the Apoſtle) diſcerneth all things, That, for diuiding; and be wiſe vnto Sobrietie, that, for beeing Rom. 12. 3. too buſie in deuiſing Myſteries. For chewing the Cudde, They may bée ſaid to doe it, and ſo to be cleane, who meditate of that they heare and learne out of Gods Booke, and often repeating it in their mindes, ponder 
                        Luke 2. 19. 
                        it in their heart, as is ſaid of the bleſſed Virgin. A thing much commended in the Scripture, as in the firſt Pſalme. Bleſſed is that man that meditateth in the Law of God day

                        and night. Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my hart be alway acceptable in thy ſight, O Lord, my ſtrength, &amp; my Redemer. Iſaac

                     2 Your Chapter nameth many particulars, which Verſe. 5. were but curioſitie to ſtand on. A few may be touched, for example ſake. The Cony was vncleane becauſe hee cheweth the cudde, and diuideth not the hoofe. And by this, ſome haue thought, were figured out ſuch men and women, as lay vp their treaſures in earth, becauſe the Conies digge and ſcrape, and make their berryes in the earth, whereas the Scripture teacheth vs not to doe thus, but to lay vp our treaſures in Heauen, where no 
                        Math. 6. 19. 
                        theefe, no moth, &amp;c. Theſe men and women are vncleane, and God will haue none of them.
                     3 The Hare was alſo vncleane for the ſame cauſe, Verſe. 6. 
                        becauſe hee cheweth the cudde, but diuideth not the hoofe. The Hare is a very fearefull creature, and therefore by him figured out fearefull men and women, deſpayring of grace and ſhrinking from God, fearing croſſes and loſſes, and forſaking Faith.

                         ſaith, Herein was figured ſuch vncleane perſons as bee good for nothing, but to be ſlaine. For if you conſider, what a creature the Swyne is: Hee neuer looketh vp to Heauen, but hath his mouth euer in the earth and myre, caring for nothing but his belly. Hee ſerueth not to ride vpon, as doth the horſe; to till the ground, as doth the Oxe; to giue milke, as doth the Cowe; to cloath vs with his fléece, as doth the Sheepe; to watch by night

for vs, as doth the Dogge, and ſo foorth, but he is onely nouriſhed for the knife, and his death hath vſe, his life hath none. Such ought not men and women to bée, and if any be ſuch, they are vncleane. God would admoniſh the Iewes by this Figure, and ſtill we may learne by it, to be no Swyne, no Hogge, no filthy myrie creatures wallowing in ſinne and vncleanes, without regard and féeling, louing the earth and looking euer on the earth, rooting in it all the day, and féeding the belly with all gréedineſſe, nouriſhed onely to the ſlaughter, and profiting no way whileſt we liue. A profitable meditation for Gods children, that they may ſo continue, and a profitable remembrance to others not yet called, that they may become his children. A good caueat to rich Cormorants in this world, who neuer profite any, till they dye, with all the wealth they haue. A knife therefore for the Hogge, that wée may haue Puddings; and death for ſuch Wretches, that the Common-wealth may haue vſe of their bagges.

                        vncleane. Faith without workes is not a true Faith, but

                        TEREUS King of Thracia, maryed Progne daughter of Pandion; which Progne hauing a ſiſter called Philomela, 
                        Ouid. Metamor: Fab. Septima. 
                        after certaine yeares, deſired her husband, that either ſhee might goe to her ſiſter to ſee her, or haue her ſiſter fetched vnto her. The King willingly yeelded, He would fetch her ſiſter to her, and to that end went to ſea, came to her Father and his Father in-law, obtained leaue for her, to goe with him for awhile to her ſiſter. But ſee, as they were in their iourney, his vncleane heart burned in luſt towards Philomela his wiues ſiſter, and by force abuſed her, cutting out her tongue after, that ſhee might not tell. Thus dumbe &amp; ſpeachles he brought her home to her ſiſter, who amazed at this change in her, and not knowing more then her husband the King would tell her, in ſtead of ioy, had great ſorrowe in her ſelfe, no way now able to talke with her ſiſter, and to haue any comfort in her. But Philomela getting an needle and ſilke, expreſſed thereby as by writing, how her husband had abuſed her bodie, and cut out her tongue, as hee brought her to ſee her. Then Progne all inraged with furie and wrath, caſting which way to bee reuenged of him for this odious fact, caught at laſt her little ſonne by him, and ſlew him crying vpon her, Mother, Mother, and claſping about her neck with kiſſes as long as he could, making meate of him for the King his father. The King liking the meate
                           
well, called for the little childe, that he might haue ſome of it, when ſhee with a fierce looke told him, he had his childe in his bellye for the good he had done to her ſiſter, and with that ſhewed him the head, flinging foorth from him as faſt as ſhee could, hee ſo aſtoniſhed that he could not tell what he did. Then (ſaith the Poet) they were all three, to auoyd further miſchiefe, ſuddenly changed into three Fowles: Progne, this cruell Mother, into a Swallowe, who caryeth red vpon his breſt, to note the bloodineſſe of her breſt; Philomela her ſiſter, into a Nightingale, who keepeth in the woods, as aſhamed of the villanie done to her by the King, and lamenteth it in the Night by her ſorrowfull ſong. The wicked King, who was cauſe of all, into a Lapwyng, which is delighted with dounge and filth to note his foule and filthy minde to his ſiſter in-law, hath a long bill wherewith he ſtriketh and hurteth other Birds, noting his cruell knife, that cut out his ſiſters tongue, feathers vpon the head like a crowne, noting his place &amp; dignitie that he was a King, wherevpon the Verſes were made.

                     The Lapwyng then, may ſhadow out all foule vncleane mindes, full of crueltie and luſt, full of crueltie alſo to worke the concealment of luſt, as you ſée in Dauid, 
                        2. Sam. 11. firſt luſting, and then killing. But thus to follow Allegories I forbeare, onely noting thus much, to ſhew you Learned mens applications of theſe things for our good. And ſurely, although I dare not ſay, that by theſe vncleane birds and beaſts thus much was meant, yet thus much is moſt certaine, that whoſo haue theſe qualities noted in the nature of them, they are as certainly vncleane to God, as theſe birds were for vſe of meat to this people. Let vs euer therefore abhorre ſuch

ſpots, that we be cleane to the Lord who is cleaneneſſe it ſelfe.
                     8 Some thing is ſpoken in your Chapter, of creeping things, whereby men haue noted the vncleanenes ſhadowed of ſuch as minde earthly things too much, and particularly by the Weaſel, deceitfull perſons,
                         becauſe the Weaſell is deceitfull and craftie. By the Mouſe, ſuch
                         as liue vpon others labours and are vnprofitable themſelues. By the Want, or Mole, ſuch
                         as are blinde and ignorant.
                     
                     
                        Laſtly, that which is ſpoken of vncleanenes, growing by the touch of theſe things, and that which you reade Verſ. 2. 4. &amp;c. of waſhing and breaking earthen Veſſels, you muſt euer take it ſo, that God ſtood not ſo much vpon theſe Ceremonies, as to teach his People héereby inward trueth, and cleaneneſſe of heart, euer fit for ſuch as belong to him, and without which none can be accepted of him. At this therefore (as I ſayd) wée muſt carefully ayme, that we may be holy, as our heauenly Father is holy. And among all vncleaneneſſe, beware of that which is noted verſe 27. by ſuch things, as goe vpon their pawes, Namely, to profeſſe the Goſpell for lucre-ſake. For where that is the cauſe, the effect will fayle with the cauſe, and whileſt it continueth and faileth not, yet is it hatefull to GOD for his ground. The Goſpell muſt bée loued to gaine Heauen, and not to purchaſe the earth by it, further than GOD ſhall pleaſe to caſt it as an adiacent by his promiſe.

                        IN this Chapter is contained the maner of VVomens purifying in thoſe dayes after Child-birth. A thing not to bée forced vpon vs in maner and forme as it then was vſed, no more than other the Ceremoniall Lawes of Moſes. Yet is the Law and honeſtie of nature, ſtill and euer to be obſerued amongſt all people. And foraſmuch as in the Goſpell, there is mention made of the Bleſſed 
                        Luke 2. 22. 
                        
                           Ʋirgins Purifying,
                         let vs bréefly conſider this cuſtome, and labour to draw fit profit from it to our ſelues.
                     1 Moſes is willed to ſpeake vnto the Children of Iſrael,
                         
                        verſ. 1. 2. that is, to the men, that when a Woman hath brought foorth ſeede, &amp;c.
                         Why ſhould the Law for VVomen, be publiſhed and giuen to the men, and not rather to the women themſelues? Surely, to the ende that men might ioyne alſo with the women, in a care to ſée it obſerued and kept according to the Commandement. As the Lawes of Kings and Princes, which belong to Labourers, are giuen to Lords to ſée them executed and performed. Let Men note, what truſt God repoſeth in Note. them, to ſée that their wiues kéepe his Lawes and Ordinances, and let them neuer be vnfaithfull to one of ſuch

                        loue towards them to truſt them, and of ſuch power to puniſh their breach of truſt. Let Womē
                         note it, to mooue their hearts to thinke both of their Husbands charge, and their duetie. They may not breake a Ceremonie, but their Husbands ſhall be ſhent for it, much leſſe the ſubſtance of all Religion and obedience to God. What a happy grace then, for both to ioyne together, and either to ſtriue to excell other in carefull kéeping of God his Lawes?
                     
                     2 By this Ceremonie of Purification, the Iewes (and in them all men) were put in minde of their naturall corruption, and led (as it were by the hand) to the remedie againſt the ſame, Christ Ieſus. Of the former, plainly ſpeaketh Dauid in his Pſalme, when hee ſayth, Behold, I was ſhapen in wickednes, and in ſinne hath my 
                        Pſal. 51. 5. 
                        Mother conceiued mee. Before our birth, and in our birth wée are vncleane, and from our vncleanenes our mothers alſo become vncleane. Which very plainly and truely confuteth that groſſe error of Pelagius, denying the propagation of ſinne from Parents to children, and Imitatione, non Origine. affirming that by Imitation onely, and not originally wée became euill. But if the birth were cleane, the mother by the birth ſhould not become vncleane, as this Ceremonie of Purifying did ſhadow that ſhee was. God would therefore haue all men know what they are by Nature and inheritance from their Parents, and what by grace through the remedie prouided, Chriſt our onely 1. Iohn 1. 8. 
                        righteouſneſſe and puritie. Alſo that God had rather haue them neuer enter into the Church, than to enter with corruption vnſorrowed for, and vncared for.
                     3 But why then was the Virgin Marie purified, ſince the Childe ſhee bare had no vncleanenes or corruption in him, being neither conceiued nor borne in ſinne, but the immaculate Lambe,
                         and the Sonne of God?
                         The Anſwere is, that although Chriſt in himſelfe was not

                           Marie his Mother was not indéede properly and directly ſubiect to this Lawe, becauſe ſhee conceiued not by mans ſeede, of which the Law was meant, and Chriſt 
                        Matth. 12. 8. was Lord of the Lawe; Yet foraſmuch as it pleaſed him to take vpon him the perſon of all mankinde which was corrupt and ſinfull, ſo, and in that reſpect both hee and the Bleſſed Virgin
                         became obedient to the Law. He, (ſaith the Apostle) that he might redeeme vs from the curſe of

                         who were indéed ſubiect to it, as alſo, by this his voluntary ſubmiſſion to it, He might take away, abrogate and giue an end to this Ceremonie, ſo that now it is not néedfull to preſent any children in the Temple with an Offering as then was vſed, but all puritie and cleanenes is to be ſought for in Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe onely, the body and truth of all theſe Figures and ſhadowes 
                        Col. 2. 17. in the Law.
                     
                     4 A Queſtion againe may bée aſked, why the time 
                        Verſ. 5. of Purification was doubled in a woman-childe, to that it was in a man-childe? And Anſwere is made by ſome, that it was in reſpect of a naturall cauſe in the body, which I leaue. Others, becauſe in women there is more vice and euil than in man: A hard iudgement and without any Warrant, for who knoweth what is in either but onely God, I meane, the greatnes and full meaſure of euill? Thirdly therefore it is anſwered, and with more probabilitie, that it was, becauſe the woman was the beginning of our fall, deceiuing her 1. Tim. 2. 14. 
                        husband when ſhe was deceiued her-ſelfe, and ſo drawing all her poſteritie into the like fall and ruine with her. But the laſt Anſwere and beſt (as I thinke) is, becauſe a man-childe was circumciſed, and not the woman, therefore the puniſhment of being vncleane was leſſned in the Male, and doubled in the Female.
                     
                     5 The Difference of Offering allowed to the poorer 
                        Verſe 8. 
                        ſort, very comfortably ſheweth the gracious care God hath of our pouerty &amp; meane eſtate, as alſo how little he
                        
paſſeth for any of our pompe &amp; riches, accepting aſwel of two Turtles, or two yong Pigeons as of a Lambe, when abilitie ſerueth not to bring a Lambe. Let the due meditation hereof raiſe vp our hearts if wée bée poore, and pull downe our ſtomackes if wée bée rich: for the matter accepted with God, is not glorie and Pompe, but a true heart fearing to doe euill, and hungring to do well, reſting in Chriſt, and in nothing els, as the true medicine for all our ſores, and moſt pleaſing Sacrifice for all our ſinnes. Riches are comfortable if God giue them and grace with them, but pouertie is no miſerie when wée feare God.
                     
                     6 Laſtly, concerning the vſe with vs, wée muſt well conſider, that although this Ceremoniall Lawe of Moſes be abrogated and gone, yet honeſtie of Nature, and modeſtie in women-kinde is neither abrogated nor gone. Therefore, euen ſtill wée retaine in our Church, a lawfull and laudable cuſtome among women, that they ſhal reſt a time after child-birth, to gather ſtrength againe in their houſes, without comming abroad, and when God ſhall inable them to indure the Ayer, then to come to Church, accompayned with their louing friends and neigbours, there thankfully to acknowledge Gods great mercie to them, in both giuing them ſafe deliuerance, and bleſſing them with fruite of their bodyes to their comfort. But ſée the difference of the Moſaicall Law, and this our Cuſtome. There the woman was put apart by God, and ſo continued vncleane Fortie dayes vpon a man-childe, and double vpon a Mayd; With vs neither by God nor man is ſhee put aſide for any time certaine, but as the Lord ſhall giue ſtrength ſooner or longer ſhe is at her libetry, yet euer obſeruing womanly modeſtie, as is moſt fit. There, ſhe was to touch no holy thing, neither to come into the Sanctuarie, til that time was out: with vs, ſhe may touch any thing, and come to the Sanctuarie when ſhee will, with reſpect

aboue ſaid: There, was a difference betwixt a man-childe and a mayd, with vs, none, but both alike: There, was a Burnt-Offering, and a Sinne-Offering; with vs, neither the one, nor the other: There, an Attonement was made for her, with vs, no ſuch thing. Laſtly, there, ſhee was vncleane till all were ended, with vs, neuer vncleane, at all, And doe wée then retaine ſtill a Iewiſh Purifying? Farre bée from vs both vntrue ſpeach and falſe iudgement. Our cuſtome, you ſée, differeth greatly from This Iewiſh Ceremonie, and is nothing but a néedfull thing in regard of weakneſſe, a modeſt Ceremonie in regard of womanhood, and a Chriſtian dutie in regard of mercie and comfort receiued, to come to the Church, and to giue him thanks moſt humbly and heartily, that hath dealt ſo kindly and mercifully with vs. Let vs therefore loue to bée obedient to good things, hate to be contentious and troubleſome in a peaceable Church, and let modeſtie euer make vs eſtéeme better of our Gouernours than of our ſelues. There was neuer the thing ſince the world was made, which an euill heart and a lawleſſe tongue may not carpe at, but the Apoſtles wordes
                         muſt rule the Apoſtles Schollers, VVee
                         
                        1. Cor. 11. 16. 
                        haue no ſuch cuſtome, neither the Church of GOD. Women in Womens matters may haue authoritie to diſcerne what is fitte, and why ſhould any immodeſt minde meddle with them, ſo much as to raiſe ſtirres, and breake peace in things eſtabliſhed by Law, by honeſtie, by modeſtie, by long continuance, and all good approbation? I truſt what is paſt is dead, and will neuer reuiue againe. God make vs thankfull for our Gouernment and Lawes, and for the happy peace both of Church and Common-wealth, and let vs neuer bée the breakers of it. Amen, Amen. And ſo no more of this Chapter.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. XIII.
                     
                        IN this Chapter, you haue an other kinde of vncleaneſſe ſpoken of, namely the Leproſie, a diſeaſe verie fearefull and vgly. Whereof three ſorts 
                        The ſumme of the Chapter. are named, to wit, Of the bodie; of the Garments; and of the houſe; for all theſe might be infected and vncleane. And learned men are of opinion, that after ſome ſpeciall and peculiar maner vnknowne this day to vs, the Iewes were troubled and afflicted with this diſeaſe. For profite and vſe to vs, when we read theſe thinges (which is all my drift) thus wée may better our ſelues and gather good. Firſt, let vs marke who were appointed Iudges hereof to tell when any man was infected with this maladie, ſurely not all the Leuites, but Aaron onely and his Sonnes,
                         who were Prieſts. By which, our popiſh Teachers would gather an argument for their Verſe 1: 
                        auricular confeſſion, and ea
                              •
                           e ſhrift, that as theſe Prieſts were made Iudges of this contagion of bodie by viewing and looking on it, ſo they ſhould bée Iudges of the Leproſie of the ſoule by hearing confeſſions of men and women, and iudging of the qualities of their ſeuerall ſinnes. But alas, it hangeth together as the ſand doth, the one hauing expreſſe warrant, and the other none. And if it were good to gather arguments in this ſort, we might rather conclude the contrarie, that foraſmuch as Aaron and his Sonnes
                         were not made Iudges of any ſecret matter, but onely when it was broken out into plaine apparance of a ſwelling in the skinne, of a ſcabbe, or a white ſpot &amp;c. Therefore, neither muſt theſe Romiſh 
                        Verſe 2. 
                        Maſters meddle with hidden and ſecret thinges as they doe, but onely with matters publique, and publiquely.

Let this idle collection therefore of theirs goe, and we truely and rightly learne by this, that herein was figured, not that Romiſh Prieſthood, but the pure and holy Prieſthood of our bleſſed Sauiour, who doth ſée and know, handle and touch, regard and heale all our ſpirituall ſpots, as theſe Prieſts here dealt with this bodily infection. So that, if wée be vncleane, wée cannot deceiue him, but full well He ſéeth and knoweth vs to be ſo, He iudging vs ſo, putteth vs apart for ſuch, and till ſorrow ſinking into our hearts for the ſame we repent and take hold of him by Faith, that we may be healed by him, we neuer recouer any health; and when we doe, then are wée cured, and ſo pronounced by him to our eternall ioy and comfort. Away therefore with our figge leaues, for they cannot couer vs, if I be a ſwearer, an vncleane liuer, a drunkard, an enuious perſon, a ſlaunderer, or ſuch like, I am a Leper, a ſpirituall Lèper, and Chriſt is Iudge whome I cannot mocke, he wil neuer ſay I am cleane, till indéede I be ſo, and ſo without amendment of life, I muſt out of the hoſt, that is, out of the Church and number of his choſen, to die for euer in my impuritie. Thinke, thinke of it while you haue time.
                     2 When you read in the fourth verſe, of ſhutting vp the 
                        Verſ. 4. 5. 
                        partie for ſeuen dayes, and then to looke on it againe, you may note with your ſelf, how greatly God hateth haſty, raſh, and vncharitable iudgement. A thing, which many men and women otherwiſe honeſt and good, are carried away withall, to their owne great hurt, not onely in ſoule, but in worldly reputation alſo, and to the bitter and biting diſcomfort of thoſe whom they ought to loue and iudge well of. Nay, you may reaſon further with your ſelfe thus, that if in a matter thus ſubiect to the eye, as theſe ſores were, yet God would haue no haſt, but a ſtay for ſeuen daies, and longer as occaſion ſerued, before any iudgement ſhould bée giuen that the partie

was vncleane. O how much more doth he abhorre haſt, &amp; loue leaſure, in pronouncing of the hearts &amp; thoughts of our friends and neighbours, which are not ſeene, nor ſubiect to an eaſie cenſure? Be admoniſhed therefore and bettered by this, as long as you liue, in this matter, and you ſhall much pleaſe both God and man. The more to ſtrengthen you in this courſe, often remè̄
                        ber what holy Fathers and vertuous men haue done in their times. What doth Peace (ſaith S. Auguſtine) in 
                        Aug. in Pſa. 147. 
                        this pilgrimage of our mortalitie, wherein no mans heart can bee knowne or diſcerned what it is? I will tell you (ſaith hee) what it doth. It iudgeth not of vncertaine thinges, it confirmeth not vnknowne matters. It is more prone and readie to beleeue well of a man, than to ſuſpect euill. It greeueth not much if happily ſometimes it erre by thinking well of one that deſerueth it not, but it feareth much to erre in thinking ill of one that deſerueth well. What looſe I, if I iudge one good, when it is vncertain 
                        Quid perdo, ſi credo quia bonus eſt, ſi incertum eſt, vtrum ſit malus? 
                        that he is ill? Although thou beware, for feare it be true, yet thou mayſt not condemne him, as if it were true. This Peace requireth, and follow peace and enſue it &amp;c. S. Bernard againe notably. Beware euer to be a curious ſcanner of other mens liues, or a raſh iudge although thou ſee ſomewhat amiſſe, but rather excuſe his meaning, if thou 
                        Dicito apud reipſum, vehemens fuit tentatio, quid de me illa feciſset ſi accipiſſet in me ſimilem poteſtatem. Bernard. Notaui luctum, nec vllum in eo detractionis aut condemnationis veſtigium inueni. 
                        canſt not defend his act, as that he did it ignorantly &amp;c. And if the matter admit no excuſe, then ſay to thy ſelfe in thy heart, ô it was a vehement and ſtrong temptation, and what would it haue wrought in me, if it had aſſayled me, as it did him? Againe, there are none ſo readie to iudge others as they that neuer iudge thēſelues. But could that veyle be remooued frō their eyes, and they made to ſee themſelues, though they could liue an hundred yeeres, &amp; the flood Iordan be turned into teares flowing from their eyes, they would thinke all too little to bewayle their owne ſpots, and neuer buſie themſelues with other mens. I haue noted ſorrow, and I neuer ſaw ſo much as a ſtep of detraction

or condemnation of others in it &amp;c. Againe, as onely pride is ynough to condemne a man without any other vice with it, ſo is this ſin of iudging. For by this the Phariſie
                         
                        
                           Luke 18. 11. Bern. Clim. grad. 
                        was condemned. A wiſe gatherer of grapes gathereth but the ripe and good grapes, and medleth not with the ſowre and ill grapes, and euen a good man or woman noteth mens vertues &amp; ſpeaketh of them, when a foole will bee medling with their imperfections. Saint Chryſoſtome, 
                        Chryſoſt. in Matth. followeth alſo this way, and hath theſe words; As it is hard for one that is good himſelfe, to iudge another to bee naught: ſo it is againe, as hard for one that is naught himſelfe, to iudge another to bee good.
                         Euery man by himſelfe will iudge of others. The Fornicator thinketh no man chaſte, but the chaſte-man ſo eaſily ſuſpecteth not the Fornicator. The proude man thinketh none to be humble, but the humble man thinketh none to bée proud. It was Aeſops ſpeach, that euery one hath a wallet on his ſhoulder, and into the end that hangeth before him, putteth other mens actions, but his owne euer into the ende behinde him and out of his ſight. It was Tullie his ſpeach, that as euery one is good himſelfe, ſo

                        he hardly conceiueth others to be euil. And contrariwiſe, how hardly euill perſons doe thinke well of others, conſider in them that could not beleeue that Dauid ſent his Meſſengers in loue and kindnes as hée did, but rather as ſpies to ſome euill purpoſe, and thereupon they abuſed them as they did, by ſhauing their beards and cutting their clothes. Which lewd ſuſpicion turned to the ouerthrow of them and theirs, yea, of the whole kingdome, that by ſuch a puniſhment we might euer learne to hate ſuch a vice, as falſe ſuſpicion is. You ſée nowe the practiſe and doctrine of the wiſe, let it mooue you, let it ſmite you, let it better you till your death.
                     3 In the 7. verſe, you haue an example how one Verſe 7, quit and pronounced cleane, may yet be viewed after againe, and bee found vncleane, which may thus profite

you, to make you remember two iudgements, the one of Man, the other of God. By the former, we may bée cleered, and by the later we may bée condemned. Therfore euer looke how all is in his eyes that knoweth all, and make peace with him by true repentance and amendement of life, little ioying in Mans iudgement who taketh mée for a Saint, if this righteous Iudge of all Iudges know me for a Deuill. Let vs ſearch and try our wayes, (ſaith the Prophet Ieremie) and turne againe to 
                        Ier. Lament. 3. 40. 41. 
                        the Lord, let vs lift vp our hearts with our hands vnto God in the heauens, &amp;c.

                        fleſh, the Prieſt pronounced him cleane, and not to bée put apart, becauſe ſaith your Marginall Note, this was not that contagious Leproſie which infected, but a kind of ſkirf which had not the fleſh rawe as the Leproſie had. This diuerſitie of ſores may put vs in mind of the diuerſitie of ſinnes, and puniſhments to be impoſed vpon men for them. And make vs more wiſe in chaſtiſing others, and patient when wée are corrected our ſelues, the puniſhment being fitted to the fault. But moſt notably it may ſtrike vs with a thankfull conſideration of that mercie, that among this diuerſitie of ſores, layeth neither one nor other vpon vs, but graunteth health and freedome from all. The Lord of his goodneſſe make vs euer thankfull for our ſelues and ours, and continue this fauour to vs.
                     5 The Leaper alſo, ſaith your Chapter, in whom the 
                        Verſ. 45. 
                        plague is, was to haue his clothes rent, (in ſigne of ſorrow and lamentation) and his head bare, and muſt put a couering 
                        Hee dwelt alone out of the tents, and if hee were a Prieſt he did eate no more of the holy things. Chap. 22. 
                        vpon his lippes, (either in token of mourning, or for feare of infecting others) and ſhould cry, I am vncleane, I am vncleane. So carefull was God, to haue vncleane perſons knowne and diſcerned from others in thoſe dayes. And wée may take occaſion to wiſh, that with vs alſo in theſe dayes, all bold and preſumtuous

miſlyuers, being moſt vncleane before God and al good men, were diſtinguiſhed from them that hate their wickedneſſe, by ſome ſuch open markes as theſe were, to the end that others might both auoyd them, and they themſelues bee ſtricken with ſome ſhame to amendment of life and ſauing of their ſoules. In former times harlots had obſcure and remote places to dwell in, and by their habitation they were diſcerned, but now it is to be feared, both in dwelling, in apparell, and other things they compare with, and farre excéede to, thoſe whoſe ſhooee they are not worthy to beare. But yet God knoweth them, and 
                           
                              •
                           ee is iuſt if they amend not. No gaudie gallants can deceiue him, but his eyes pierce through all Maſkes and colours whatſoeuer. Allegorically, ſome haue ſaide theſe things in the Leaper ſhadowed the ſtate and caſe of all wicked men and women. As the rent clothes, that they are vile and odious before God; his bare-head, that in Chriſt their head they haue no portion, but are depriued of him; his lippes or mouth couered, that ſuch graceleſſe perſons cannot open their mouthes before God in any praier to be heard; his ſhutting out of the Campe, that ſuch are to bée excommunicate from the number of the faithfull, and are depriued of the heauenly inheritance, &amp;c. Sée more the 22. Chapter.
                     
                     6 In the 47. ver. you read of the Leproſie of garments 
                        Verſe 47, &amp;c. 
                        &amp;c. Which kinde of contagion and infection, the Lord in his infinite mercie hath made vs ignorant of. The waſhing commaunded here of ſuch garments admoniſhed them, and in them ſtill vs, that our dutie is to abſtaine from all vncleanneſſe, and to purge our ſelues from all pollution both of body and ſpirit. If garments may haue ſuch things layd vppon them by God, how much more our fleſh and our bodyes, and therefore againe thinke with all thankfull thoughts of the bleſſing of health, and of the meanes vouchſafed of God for

                        health, as Prayer, Phyſitions, Chirurgions, Hearbs, and Medicines many, whereof the wiſe Syrach
                         ſpeaketh in his 38. Chap. reade it often and with feeling. One Ecclus. 38. ſight of your face in a glaſſe as the Lord could ſmite it in a moment, would make you féele and ſée what God doth for you in giuing health and fréedome from ſuch ſtrange ſores, &amp;c.
                     7 Much more might bée noted in this Chapter, but it is fitter for Phyſitions, and therefore I paſſe it ouer. Onely I will remember a Queſtion mooued, whether for any ſuch fearefull infections a man and wife may bée diuorced, and leauing all large diſcourſe, which they that are fit may haue in many Writers, I anſwere bréefly, that more cauſes of diuorce than wée read in Scripture, wée may not preſume to make, and that is, but in the caſe of Adulterye. This excepted, the Rule, ſtandeth firme, Whom God hath ioyned together, let no 
                        Mat. 19. 6. 
                        man put aſunder. Secondly, it were a kinde of bitter crueltie to adde ſuch affliction to the afflicted ſo ſore alreadie, as to take husband from wife, or wife from huſband, who mutually ſhould comfort each other in all extremites and croſſing woes of this changing world, and with that condition haue béen ioyned and plighted their troth one to the other, that in ſickneſſe as well as health, they would cleaue together forſaking all others till the death of one of them. But then againe on the other ſide, as cruell and inconvenient it were, to bynde the partie cleane, to company and due beneuolence with the infected. For this were euident danger to the cleane, and to the ſeede that ſhould come of them in that caſe, and ſo conſequently to the Common-wealth alſo, by the ſpreading of ſuch a fearefull maladie in it. Wherefore the middle-way is beſt for all parties, Namely, that the knot of Mariage remaine vnbroken, and the partie cleane performe all Offices of helpe and comfort to the vncleane, ſauing coniunction of bodyes,

that the partie infected ſée how hée is called of God vnto Chaſtity during this caſe of his, and therefore by Dyet, by Watching, and Prayer, and all good meanes, indeuour to kéepe his body vnder from ſuch deſires, laying his ſinnes to his heart, for which this &amp; much more is due vnto him, (although happily impoſed vppon him, not for his ſinne, but for his tryall and the glorie of God) and yet taking a true and comfortable hold vpon his God, whoſe mercie hath neither bottome nor meaſure, and who hath promiſed moſt graciouſly that hée will neuer lay more vpon any childe of his than hee ſhall 
                        1. Cor. 10. 19. 
                        be able to beare, but will giue an yſſue to the temptation and tryall that he may beare it. Thus God hath his time to heale as well as to ſtricke, to comfort aſwell as to afflict, and to wipe all teares away aſwell as to cauſe them any way. Looke vp then to him and euer truſt in him. Say with Iob, in a holy chéerefulneſſe, If the Lord 
                        Iob 13. 15. 1. Sam. 3. 18. 
                        ſhall kill mee, I will not ſhrinke from him. With Heli, and Dauid, It is hee, it is hee, let him doe his good pleaſure. His correction hath an ende, but his loue ſhall neuer haue an ende, if I ſubmit my ſelfe and bée patient. Let friends alſo be full of comfort to ſuch a one, and not by the leaſt looke, word, or action adde griefe vnto griefe. God will ſée it and reward it.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XIIII.
                     
                        NOw, that it is moſt true, God hath a The ſumme of the Chapter. time to heale as well as to ſtrike, and to comfort aſwell as to grieue, behold your ſelfe in this Chapter, where you ſhall read, that many thus afflicted, were in God his goodneſſe healed againe, and reſtored both to their houſes in the hoſt, and their places in the Tabernacle, as ſound as euer they

were. The Ceremonies of this reſtitution are here alſo appointed both to the one place and the other, whereof let vs labour to make ſome good vſe to our ſelues.
                     1 Hee was brought vnto the Prieſt,
                         as to him that Verſ 2. muſt iudge whether hee was cleane or no, and why the Prieſt was ſo appoynted to be Iudge, you had the reaſon in the beginning of the former Chapter. But where muſt hee be brought vnto the Prieſt? into the Campe &amp; Congregation where the Prieſt was? No, but the Prieſt, ſaith the Text, ſhall goe out of the Campe, and conſider him. So is it ſtill the dutie of all faithfull Miniſters to goe to the ſicke, to ſée them and conſider their eſtate toward God, miniſtring comfort to them in due ſeaſon, whileſt their hearing is good, their vnderſtanding good, and their memorie good. For when theſe things are decayed, we labour often to little purpoſe. And would God both they that are ſicke had more care often to ſend for their Miniſters to them in due time, and the Miniſters when they know it, to goe, and with all care and diligence to labour with them whileſt time ſerueth. For it is too late for both parties, when Death hath ſtricken his ſtrooke.
                     2 If the Prieſt thus comming to him, found him cleane, then did hée ſo pronounce him to be and appoint him to offer his guift, &amp;c. But except hée were cleane, the Prieſt durſt not pronounce him cleane. Thus remayned the glory of his health to God that had giuen it, and to the Church the vſe of the Miniſterie both for order and comfort. Sée héerein the manner of our Abſolution reteyned in the true Church of Chriſt, and practiſed. Wee doe not heale the ſinner from his ſpirituall diſeaſe of ſoule by forgiuing his ſinne, as the Prieſt here healed not the reall diſeaſe of the body by making him ſound, but when wee ſée heartie repentance and a liuely faith in the promiſes of God made to penitent ſinners for Chriſt, then wée pronounce him according to our

Warrant to be forgiuen, euen as the Prieſt did heere him that indéed by Gods mercie to him was now healed of his Leproſie. So haue wée the Miniſterie of reconciliation committed vnto vs for the comfort of the penitent, but challenge not the power to forgiue, which belongeth to God onely, as that man of ſinne doth, who in his blaſphemous Pardons taketh vppon him to forgiue both Paenam &amp; Culpam, the puniſhment and the ſinne.
                         In regard then of this order and vſe of the Miniſterie it was, that Chriſt bad the Leper whom hée had Matth. 8. 4. 
                        cleanſed goe ſhew himſelfe to the Prieſt, becauſe till the Prieſt vpon view ſaid he was cleane he might not bée admitted into the Congregation. The Fathers alleage other cauſes which alſo may ſtand with this, and with profit be obſerued, as for that he would haue all honour preſerued to the Prieſts that God had beſtowed on them, and himſelfe be no example of taking any iote away. Now to be Iudge was an honour, and therefore

                        he will haue it preſerued. That thus the Prieſts might bée drawen to beléeue on him and ſo to bée ſaued, or elſe to be made inexcuſable for their contempt; That he might not séeme a breaker of the Lawe, as often hée was accuſed to bée; That he might be thankfull to God who had ſo mercifully healed; a thing often promiſed in ſickeneſte, but ſeldome performed after recouerie, &amp;c.

                        Verſ. 7. 
                        muſt ſprinkle vpon him that was cleanſed of his Leproſie, ſeuen times, and cleanſe him, and then let goe the liue ſparow into the broad field, &amp;c. Euſebius Emiſſenus
                         in one of his Homelies ſaith, theſe things might ſeeme light, if they had not beene appointed by him whoſe leaſt commandement is not light. By the two ſparrowes therefore (ſaith he) the clenſed perſon might be put in minde, 
                           Theodoret. ad duas in Chriſto moriente naturas accommodat. Dialog. 3. to offer vnto God both ſoule and body a liuing ſacrifice no more to ſerue the world and the pleaſures of this life, but the God of goodneſſe and mercie that had clenſed him from ſo great and greiuous a maladie. The Cedar-wood being a wood that will not eaſily corrupt, and that hath alſo a good and pleaſing ſmell might ſhadow out vnto him alſo a holy life, ſweet manners, and incorrupt actions how pleaſing to God, how fit for him that thus was clenſed. The skarlet lace being red and of the colour of fire might tell him how due from him were hote thoughts of heartie thankefulneſſe from a burning heart to God, and true loue &amp; charitie to all his neighbours. The Hyſſope growing vſually in the rock, how rooted hée ought to be in Chriſt the ſonne of God the true Rocke. The ſparrow ſlaine might teach him the neceſſitie of mortification in the body which in deede is an earthen veſſell, the killing of it ouer pure water, that nothing more worketh this mortification than pure water of Gods word contayned in the Scriptures. The liuing ſparrow letten flye abroad, might ſhadow the ſoule liuing vnto righteouſneſſe through the grace of God, and ſet at libertie to mount aloft when the body is dead. Thus Eufebius too curiouſly and nicely ſkanneth theſe things. But hauing noted therein the fancies

of men otherwiſe graue, and wiſe and learned, I hold it better that we gather but thus much, that by the blood of Chriſt we are truely clenſed and ſet at libertie, not otherwiſe: as héere the liue ſparrow dipped in the blood of the ſlayne ſparow is ſet free. The ſeauenfold ſprinkling might happely ſhadow an earneſt and continued meditation of Gods goodneſſe to him that thus was comforted, and not for a bay or two, and then no more. Surely our thoughts of his mercie vouchſafed to vs are euer too ſhort and tranſitorie, and therefore ſeauen ſprinklings are little ynough to teach vs our dutie herein, God for his mercie ſo ſprinkle vs ouer and ouer, that wée may euer remember his kinde goodnes towards vs a thouſand wayes: Saying with the thanfull Prophet to our ſelues and ſoules often, Praiſe the 
                        Pſal. 103. 2. 
                        Lord O my ſoule, and forget not, forget not all his benefites:
                         his infinite benefits, his ſweete benefits, his moſt vnderſerued benefits on our parts. The Shauing and Verſe 8. &amp;c. 
                        waſhing mentioned alſo, ſhadowed truely vnto him his new life, in the obedience of GOD, aſwell as his perfect and full curing from the Leproſie. The care that GOD hath ſtill of the poore in allowing Verſe 21. a difference of Offering for them, is ſtill to bée noted how often ſo-euer it commeth, that wée may sée his goodneſſe and bée ſoundly rooted in our hope in him, Verſe 10. bée wée neuer ſo poore. The Oyle, as before in this Booke hath béen noted, ſhadowed the holy ſpirite of God purchaſed for vs and to vs by Chriſt, and the anoynting of his right care and thumbe &amp;c, That our verſ. 14. 
                        eare ought to heare, and all our might performe the bleſſed Will of him that clenſeth vs from our ſoule diſeaſes.
                     4 Now hauing thus ſpoken of the Ceremonies of clenſing men and women, hée commeth in the 34. verſ. 34. 
                        verſe to ſpeake of clenſing of leprous houſes. Where remember againe, that this kinde of leproſie is vnknowne

vnto vs, and God make vs thankfull for it. But when it was, and where it was, the Text ſaith, God ſent it, and it well ſheweth, that euen the well being of our Verſe 34. 
                        houſes is a mercie and not a little one, although we too little thinke of it. And if the walles of ſtone or timber may be thus ſmitten with ſuch a diſeaſe, O what can he doe with theſe bodyes of ours! theſe pampred and dainty bodyes of ours, vppon which we ſpend all our care and coſt, neuer thinking on the ſoule, till it be too late, I ſay what, what can God lay vppon them in the twinkling of an eye if he be angry &amp; turne the comfort of his face from vs? wherefore meditate of his mercie in giuing health both to body and houſe, and let it neuer be vnthought vpon, ſome-time at leaſt euery day. The markes whereby this Leproſie was diſcerned of the Prieſt you haue in the Text, deepe ſpots greeniſh 
                        verſe. 37. 
                        or reddiſh which ſéeme to belower than the wall. Alſo how the Prieſt might not raſhly condemne the houſe, but muſt ſhut it vp a time and then loke vpon it again, and yet we can haſtily and raſhly condemne our brethren, our equals, our betters, that they are thus and ſo. There was an eaſier clenſing by ſcraping and changing the infected ſtones, and a harder clenſing by quite pulling it downe. God gently dealeth with ſinners if it may ſerue, and quite ouer-throweth the incurable. The expiation ſheweth we ought to haue cleane houſes, and the Offering noteth from whom all health is, euen from God.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. XV.
                     
                        SOme other vncleanes incident to man and woman is mentioned in this Chapter, whereof modeſtly you may thinke as you read it. Unto the 9. verſe he ſpeaketh of man, and then verſe 19. of the woman. For vſe vnto your ſelfe firſt conſider by occaſion of theſe things that originall corruption which is gotten into our nature by the fall of our firſt Parents, through which we are moſt vncleane many wayes in the eyes of God. The Lord hath a great care to worke this meditation in vs ſtrongly, when hée ſo amplifieth theſe natural vncleaneſſes in vs, as that euery thing is made vncleane which toucheth him in that caſe. Euery bed whereon hee lyeth, euery thing whereon hee ſitteth, whoſoeuer toucheth the bed ſhall waſh his clothes, &amp;c. He that ſitteth vpon the ſeate where hee ſate, The ſaddle that hee rideth on, yea, the veſſell that hee toucheth, and ſo foorth. So alſo of the woman in the latter part of the Chapter, modeſtly read and be edified. Thinke of the Scriptures that note this corruption in vs, telling vs that all the imaginations of the thoughts 
                        Gen. 6. 5. 
                        of our hearts are onely euill continually: That in vs, that 
                        Rom. 7. 18. 
                        is, in our fleſh dwelleth no good thing: For to will is preſent 
                        Rom. 8. 5. 
                        with ſome (as with the Apostle that ſpake it, and yet he found no meanes to performe that which is good.) For hee could not doe the good which he would, but the euill that he would not that did hee. And ſo foorth, as followeth in that Chapter moſt notably. That they which are 
                        1. Cor. 2. 14. 
                        in the fleſh, ſauour the things of the fleſh. That the naturall

man perceiueth not the things which are of God, but 
                        Deut. 29. 4. Epheſ 4. 18. Chap. 5. 8. Rom. 3. Pſal. 19. 
                        they are fooliſhneſſe to him, &amp;c. Thinke what particular parts of vs are charged with this corruption, &amp; ſée if they be not the very chiefeſt, as the vnderſtanding, the will, the heart, the eyes, the eares, and ſo foorth. Be mooued with it, and renouncing your ſelfe, ſéeke for remedie where it onely is, and not in your ſelfe. Follow the Counſaile of the Apoſtle &amp; take his words as an explication of the end of this Ceremonie, Namely, that wée indeauour to 
                        2. Cor. 7. 1. 
                        cleanſe our ſelues from all filthineſſe of the fleſh, and Spirit, and that wee finiſh our Sanctification in the feare of GOD.
                         To this end the Lord hath ordained holy Matrimonie, and taught that it is honourable among all men. To this end hée hath forbidden all vncleane luſts, and taught vs that Whoremongers and Adulterers hee will iudge. For this is the Will of GOD, (ſaith the Apoſtle) Euen your ſanctification, and that yee ſhould abſtaine from Fornication; That euery one ſhould know
                         
                        1. Theſ. 4. 3. 
                        to poſſeſſe his veſſell in holineſſe and honour, And not in 
                        4. 5. 
                        the luſt of concupiſcence, as the Gentiles which know not God.
                         And, bleſſed are the cleane in heart (ſaith our Sauiour Christ) for they ſhall ſee God. Strengthen your Matth. 5. 8. ſelfe therefore in this holy courſe by theſe Scriptures and the like. Conſider often the Commandement of God, in whoſe hand is death if you diſobey. Conſider his nature that hée is puritie and cleanenes it ſelfe, and as hée is our heauenly Father, ſo ſhould wée bée his children and ſeruants. Conſider how it is impoſſible to pray to him aright with an vncleane minde for any want wée haue. Conſider what hope wée can haue of eternall life, if we loue vncleanenes, when the Rule is thus, Follow holineſſe, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord. Conſider the hurt of example. The danger that groweth to a Common-wealth when for ſuch filthineſſe the Lord often Hebre. 12. 14. ouer-throweth a whole ſtate, as the licentious life of one Paris did Troy. And finally, thinke what vgly

                        diſeaſes and maladies, what rotting and burning, what ſhame and confuſion the Lord layeth euen in this life vpon vncleane perſons, beſides the fearefull fall etern
                           •
                        ll that is aſſured afterward when this life is ended. Meditate I ſay of theſe things, and pray continually for grace and ſtrength. Say with the good old Father when any wicked motion péepeth vp. O Lord helpe, O Lord
                         
                        O Domine, vim patior, ſuccurre, ſuccurre. &amp;c. 
                        ſtrengthen, for I ſuffer violence, and am aſſaulted, &amp;c.
                     
                     2 In the waſhing here mentioned and in the Atonement, note the mercie of God towardes all miſerable ſinners, and ſée with comfort, that although the fall of our firſt Parents hath thus blotted vs and ſpotted vs, that indéede we are moſt vncleane; yet ought wée not to deſpaire, but take hold of him by a liuely Faith, Who 
                        Ezech. 18. 
                        will not the death of a ſinner, but rather that hee ſhould repent and liue, diſliking himſelfe for his manifold ſins, and cleaning to his God for his manifold mercies. And when you read thus often of water, cleane not in the clement or creature of water, but remember Saint Iohn,
                         that Ieſus Christ came by water and blood,
                         and it 1. Iohn 5. 6. is hee onely that waſheth away our ſpots, and ſaueth vs from our ſinnes. Water cannot do it, nor any worke of ours, but if wee waſh our ſelues with ſnow water as Iob ſaith, and purge our hands moſt cleane; Yet ſhall 
                        Iob. 9. 30. 31. 
                        he plunge vs in the pit, and our owne clothes ſhall make vs filthy. And by the Offering of the Turtles it was playnly figured, that not in themſelues but in ſome other they muſt bée made cleane from all their impurities. Sunt qui ſtatim ſe mundos putant, ſi peccata defleant, ieiunia multiplicent, eleemoſynas largiantur, Bona ſunt haec, Fratres, ſed debitum peccati nō adaequant. I remember the Speach of a good Writer, yet a Fryer, and I pray you marke it. There are ſome, ſaith Hee, That thinke themſelues by and by made cleane if they ſhed a few teares and bewayle their ſinnes, Multiply their faſts, and giue Almes, &amp;c. But my Brethren, although theſe bee good things, yet they are not equiualent to our ſinnes. Thus breaketh trueth out of them that otherwiſe affected Rome. Sée then how

                        Poperie wrongeth the ſoules of men in ſending them to the things that cannot helpe, and drawing them deceitfull from the true and perfect ſanctification and ſatiſfaction of Chriſt. Remember the words of One of theirs.

But thus ſéeing our manifold vncleanenes and the right remedie of it by modeſtly and chaſtly reading ouer this Chapter, I wade no further in it. This is a taſte of the vſe of it.

                     CHAP. XVI.
                     1 STill the Lord goeth on to note mans imperfections &amp; how he is freed from them, ſéeing herein conſiſteth all, that wée truely know our ſelues to be as we are, and the way of God appointed for our remedie. Firſt, hée Verſe 2. forbiddeth Aaron at al times to enter into the holieſt of all, whereby may be learned that euen Miniſters aſwell as other men are not raſhly to enter into all the things of God, but to ſtand in reuerence of ſome myſteries, either

dealing not at all, or very aduiſedly and ſparingly with them as their nature requireth.
                     2 It is ſhewed how he ſhould come in, when hée did Verſe 3. enter; Namely, with a yong bullocke for a ſinne offering and ſo foorth. Learne wée may by it with what ornaments men and women ſhould come before God. It is not ſilke nor veluet that he careth for, neither the coſtly Iewels of pearle and ſtone that wée thinke ſo highly of, but come with a ſinne offering, that is, come with an humble acknowledgement (as this ſinne offering figured) that thou art a ſinner, confeſſe it to God with a gréeuing heart, and bring Ieſus Chriſt in thy ſoule with thée, offering him by thy true faith to God his Father as a ſure ſafetie for all ſinners againſt deſerued wrath and puniſhment.
                     3 Hee muſt alſo put on the holy linnen coate &amp;c. Another Verſe 4. 
                        ſhadow of Chriſt his righteouſnes, wherewith wée muſt be clothed and couered if wée euer finde acceptance with God. For to that end Aaron
                         did change his garment, to ſhewe that hée ſuſtayned an other perſon, who was holy, he himſelfe beeing but a man ſubiect to imperfection and ſinne. To which end tended alſo his waſhing and ſacrifice héere mentioned.
                     4 This likewiſe ſerued to beat into the people their corruption, when they ſawe Aaron thus changed, that was the Prieſt choſen of God and anoynted with the holy Oyle. For if hee might not enter but in ſuch ſort, how much leſſe might they appeare at any time before God but in Chriſt, and by Chriſt, ſhadowed in all theſe ſacrifices. And concerning this once entring into the Holy place, you haue had the figure of it before, and the Place to the Hebre. noted Chap. 9. verſe 8. Aaron entred but once a yéere, and Chriſt but once, the Tabernacles diuers. Aaron by blood, Chriſt by blood, but the blood diuers. Aaron made an Atonement, Chriſt
                         made an Atonement, but in a differing manner. Aaron
                         outwardly

or ciuily, as touching the ſight of man; Chriſt, of the conſcience truely and rightly and touching God. Hebr. 9. verſe 9. &amp; 13. Aaron often Heb. 10. 11. Chriſt but once Heb. 9. ver. 9. &amp; 13. verſe 12. 14. Aaron confeſſed ſinnes and layd them vpon the Goate, but his owne ſinnes aſwell as the peoples; Chriſt had no ſinnes of his owne, and ours hee bare himſelfe, Eſay. 53. 4. and layd them vpon himſelfe, not vpon any creature whatſoeuer.
                     5 The two hee Goates béeing preſented, lots were Verſe 7 8. to be caſt ouer them, one Lot for the Lord, and another for the Scape Goate.
                         Thus was it ſhadowed that in a ſinner there is nothing to make him worthy of God his choiſe. And therefore as GOD would not chuſe either the one Goate or other, but by lot the one was appoynted, and not by choyſe; ſo wee are accepted whenſoeuer we finde fauour, without all merit or matter, worth or dignitie in our ſelues to mooue the Lord to ſuch goodneſſe.
                     6 The Goate vpon which the Lords lot fell was offered for ſinne-offering; And Incenſe caſt vpon the fire to 
                        Verſe 9. Verſ. 13. 
                        make a cloude to couer the Mercy-ſeate that Aaron dyed not, the one ſhadowing the death of the Sonne of God, &amp; the other with what feare &amp; reuerence we ought euer to come before God. For if to Aaron the Maieſtie of him were ſo dangerous, how much more to others not to bée compared to Aaron? Would God we thought of this euer, when we come to Church to doe our duties to him. Then would there not, in that place, bée ſo much light behauiour and ſléepie vſage of our ſelues as is, by Verſ. 16. which things the holy place is defiled, verſe 16. Homines ita contaminant Dei ſacra, ne quid tamen diſcedat eorum naturae, nec dignitas violetur. Quare diſerte exprimit Moſes purgari Sanctuarium ab inquinamentis non ſuis, ſed Filiorum Iſrael. Men doe ſo pollute the holy things of God, that nothing departeth from their nature neither is their glorie violated. Therefore playnly doth Moſes lay

downe that the Sanctuarie is to bee purged from pollutions not of their owne, but of the Children of Iſrael.

That if any Euill bee to come either vpon the Sacrificers themſelues, or vpon the whole Countrey of Aegypt, it would pleaſe the Gods to turne all vpon that Head.

                        for vs. Thus the Heathen catched at things, but not in a right maner, whereby wée may well ſée what a darkeneſſe it is to bee depriued of the light of the Word of God. In like maner receiuing it from the Doctrine of the olde Fathers, by the tradition of Noah his ſonnes,
                         that there ſhould in time come a Man who taking vpon him the ſinnes of all men, ſhould become a Sacrifice for the ſaluation of all men, and not vnderſtanding the maner how this ſhould bée, they vſed in great extremities &amp; perils, as Plagues, Famine, Warres &amp;c, to offer vp men
                        
to their Gods to appeaſe their wrath thereby. So in Liuie wée read Quintus Curtius did in a time of Peſtilence: The Decij, Father and ſonne,
                         in a time of hard Warre with the Latines and Samnites; Codrus King of the Athenians in Lycurgus; Menoeceus in Euripides, and the daughters of Erecteus offered themſelues to be ſacrificed for their Countrey. So Achas, 2. Kings 16. Manaſſes, Chap. 21.

This was a great miſtaking you plainely ſée, and therefore let it mooue you to ſend vp thankfull thoughts to God for your better knowledge and vnderſtanding. What a notable Figure againe this Scape Goate was of Of the reſurrection of Chriſt, who though he bare our ſinnes, yet remayneth aliue. 
                        Christ you ſée, vpon his head all the ſinnes of mankinde were layd, hec bearing them himſelfe and remoouing them away from vs, Eſay. 53. 4.
                     8 Well may you alſo marke héere when Confeſſion was made ouer the head of this Goate, what diuerſitie of wordes are vſed, as all iniquities, all treſpaſſes, all ſinnes. Why ſo many wordes? but to teach that confeſſion of ſinnes muſt not be light and formall onely, but earneſt, vehement, heartie, and zealous. And in déed neuer can a good childe of God ſatiſfie himſelfe herein, but ſtill wiſheth hée could more bewayle his ſinnes, and more earneſtly expreſſe with words what his ſoule féeleth in this behalf: Saying as I heard a dying woman once ſay to the good profit of all about her, O Sir, I am ſorie and ſory, that I can bee no more ſory. &amp;c.

                        his clothes and his fleſh in water, and after that ſhal come into the Hoſt. If ſuch a thing did ſeparate a man in ſome ſort from the Church, how much more doth that ſinne that is our owne cleauing to vs and reſting in vs, make a diuorce betwixt God and vs, and the Church and vs? Sée therefore the vſe of theſe Figures, to worke a touch in them of the effect of ſin, &amp; let our corruption bée diſpleaſing vnto vs, that we in Chriſt may be pleaſing to God.

                        IN this Chapter you haue two ſeueral The ſumme of the Chapter. 
                        lawes giuen, which you may obſerue. The firſt, that euery Sacrifice ſhould bee brought to the doore of the Tabernacle, and no man ſhould dare to offer it otherwiſe. The ſecond againſt eating of any blood. Concerning the firſt the words are ſharpe, Namely, that the Lord will 
                        verſ. 4. 
                        impute blood vnto him, that hee hath ſhed blood, and that hee ſhall bee cut of from among the people. The reaſons both of the Lawe and this ſeueritie, were theſe and ſuch like. Firſt, becauſe it ſerued for the preſeruation of the miniſterie which God had ordained, &amp; that euery man ſhould not bee his owne Prieſt. Secondly, becauſe

it was a chiefe meanes to kéepe them from idolatrie, and offering the honour due vnto God to deuils as the By Deuils vnderſtanding whatſoeuer is not the true God, read your Marginall note and marke it. 
                        Heathens did, or to other creatures to whom it was not due. Thirdly, becauſe thus they were taught that all worſhip of God ought to bée g
                           •
                        ided and directed by his word and commandement, not by the priuate willes of men, as often before yée haue ſéene. Deut. 12. That which I command, that onely ſhall yee doe. Yea in this place, note it, and euer thinke of it, to follow my owne fancie and not Gods preſcription, is to become as odious to God as if I had killed a man Eſay 66. hee that killeth an Oxe, is as if hee killed a man, (meaning when hée killeth not the Oxe according to the maner appointed of God. Yet, yet, will ſome men teach, and ſome vnwiſe people beleeue, that a good intent will beare out all, and wée are not tyed to the Word of God, but read and remember ſuch places as theſe. Fourthly, becauſe héereby was ſignified that onely in the Church, by faith in the chief high Prieſt Chriſt Ieſus,
                         Our ſacrifice and ſeruice accepted of God, is, and can bee offered and done, and no where els. 1. Peter 2. verſe 5. Hebrews 13. 15.
                     2 But you will ſay, the Scripture doth often ment
                           ••
                        n that ſacrifices were offered elſewhere, and not brought to the doore of the Tabernacle. Which is very true; but then marke you the complaints that God maketh againſt ſuch perſons and their doings. Iehoſhaphat did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, but the high places were not taken away.
                         The firſt of Kings 22. verſe 43. The like of Ioas, the ſecond of Kings 12. 2. 3. Of Manaſſes marke what is written 2. Chron. 33. 16. 17. Of Iſrael, 2. of the Kings 17. 32. 33. Of Iuda, Iere. 44. &amp;c.
                         For in all theſe places you may ſée, that no good meanings or intents, no colours nor couers will ſerue, but foraſmuch as the preſcript forme of bringing their ſacrifices to the doore of the Tabernacle, and offering
                        
them according to ye 
                        rules giuen by God were not obſerued, therefore both they &amp; their worſhip diſpleaſed God, and that ſo highly, as grieuouſly he puniſhed thē for the ſame. And is it not a moſt ſtrange dotage, to thinke that God ſhould not appoint his owne worſhip, but wee out of our idle &amp; darke braynes do what ſéemeth good to vs? Let it mooue you &amp; euer worke with you to your good.
                     3 Yet you will ſay againe, not only theſe, but the Prophets that knew their duties, and were carefull to doe it, did not bring the ſacrifice to the Tabernacle, but offered in other places, as Samuel in Miſpah. 1. Sam. 7. and Elias in Mount Carmel. 1. Kings 18. You muſt anſwere your ſelfe thus touching theſe men, That all this in them was extraordinarie, and wée may not follow extraordinarie matters without ſome ſuch perſonal and ſpeciall vocation as no doubt they had. For wee doe not liue by examples, but by Lawes. And thus much Non exemplis, ſed legibus. of the firſt Lawe in this Chapter.
                     
                     Concerning the ſecond Law of abſtayning from eating of any blood, it was firſt giuen to Noah, Geneſis
                         9. Verſ. 1
                              •
                           . then repeated againe, as you ſaw in the third &amp; ſeuenth Chap. and ſhall ſée in the Nineteene Chap. of this Booke of Leuiticus. The Lord by this Lawe would teach men to abſtaine from murder and bloodſhed, the blood of Verſe 11. man being Vehiculum animae vitalis: for the Vitall ſpirits which yéeld vnto man through his whole bodie, heate and motion and action, are begotten of blood by the power of the heart, and therefore mans life and the life of euery other creature, is ſaid to bée in the blood. 
                        
                           Purpuream vomit ille an m

                        Secondly, becauſe the Lord had ordained blood to bée vſed in the Atonements made for ſinnes, as a plaine Figure of the blood of Chriſt,
                         the only able thing to purge and waſh away our ſinnes and offences, therefore hée would haue blood regarded as a holy thing, and not vſed by man as other meates might bée. Thus God in his Law, would not ſuffer man to eate the blood of a

                        beaſt becauſe it figured the blood of his Sonne, &amp; in poperie we are taught to make no bones at Chriſt his own blood, but to beléeue that the Wine in the Sacrament is turned into his very blood really, and then to drinke the ſame boldly. The Goſpell ſhall not yéelde ſo much reuerence to Chriſt, as the Law did; Is it to be taught and bléeued? God forbid.
                     2 You may remember how the Apoſtles continued this Law, Acts 15. 29. and aſke why being a ceremoniall Law it was more continued than others? To which anſwere is made, that chéefly for three Cauſes they did it. Firſt, to auoyd offence in the mindes of ignorant Propter Scandalum Propter Confeſſionem. Propter Diſciplinam. people not yet taught, nor of the ſuddaine apt to heare of the abrogation of ſo ancient a Lawe euer ſince Noah his time. Secondly, that thus they might ſhewe that their doctrine was no other, but euen the old ancient doctrine ſince the beginning of the Church. And thirdly, for diſcipline, that men might ſtill be afraid of murther by this continued ceremonie. After when God had vouchſafed to his Church further knowledge, this alſo was abrogated, and men left to their liberties to eate blood as well as the fleſh.

                        IN a godly Common-wealth two things are neceſſarie, right Religion according to Gods word; and holy honeſty of Matrimonie. The firſt, the Lord hath laid downe both in the ten Commandements, Exod.

                        dwelt, ſhall ye not do; and after the maner of the land of Canaan, whither I will bring you, ſhall yee not doe, neither walke in their ordinances. But doe after my iudgements,

                        and keepe my ordinances, to walke therein: I am the Lord your GOD &amp;c. This Praeface of ſome is taken 
                           Rom. 10. 5. taken generally. 
                        generally to concerne all the Lawes of God, the obſeruation whereof, is euer the ſure ſafetie of a ſtate publike or priuate. For it is not the munition of walles, leagues &amp; aliance with forreigne Princes, largenes of confines, plentie of treaſure, or ſuch like, that preſerue a Common-wealth but carefull and diligent obſeruation of publicke Lawes ordeyned of God for the good of man. It is ſayd Lacedemon flouriſhed whileſt Lycurgus his Lawes were obſerued, much more any Common-wealth when Gods be kept: for what compariſon betwixt mans Lawes &amp; Gods? Demosthenes ſaith, It was the maner of the Locrenſes that if any man would publiſh &amp; deuiſe a New law, he ſhould put his necke into a halter ready to be put to death, if the Law were not good; by which meanes they made men more carefull to obſerue old &amp; ancient, tryed &amp; knowne Lawes, than with buſie heads to make new. Now what Lawes ſo olde and ſo approued good as Gods Lawes? Euer therefore are they to be regarded and hearkened vnto. Others take this Praeface particularly of theſe Lawes concerning Mariage now following, that if they be carefully kept, a kingdome long flouriſheth, and if not, ſoone it commeth to a fearefull fall. For ſo odious and abhorred of God is the vnlawfull mixture of man and woman, that the Lord cannot long with-hold great iudgements. And thus much

remember as you reade them euer, that theſe lawes doe not concerne the Iewes onely, as the Ceremoniall lawes now ſpoken of, and iudiciall did, but theſe lawes belong to all men and women and to all ſucceding times, being eternall, immutable, grafted by God in mans nature, and giuen by him for holineſſe ſake. Note all the wordes well, that God would not haue them like either the Aeygptians or Canaanites, and wiſh with mée, that there were a like law againſt our béeing like forreigne nations néere vs, with Ruffes dipped in the deuils liquor called ſtarche, burſten-belly doublets, garded as the French, fringed as the Venetian, Turkiſh heads, Spaniſh backs, Italian waſtes &amp;c. giuing dayly occaſion to the mockers that ſay, French nets catch Engliſh fooles.
                     
                     2 The Praeface ended, God commeth to the matter Verſ. 6. it ſelfe, in the 6. verſe, ſaying. None ſhall come neere to any of the kindred of his fleſh to vncouer her ſhame; I am the LORD. Kindred is of two ſorts, by ſocietie of blood, which is called Conſanguinitie, or by carnall coniunction of man and woman, which is called Affinitie. That popiſh kindred which they called ſpiritual kin dred ariſing by baptiſme or confirmatiō, this Chapter knoweth not, neither any other part of Gods booke, it was onely deuiſed for Popes gaine.

Inter Oedipum &amp; Iocaſtam matrem, vnde Eteocles &amp; Polynices procreati ſunt Inter Neronem &amp; Agrippinā &amp;c. 3 The greateſt Conſanguinitie, is betwixt Parents and children, and therefore, that is forbidden in theſe words. Thou ſhalt not vncouer the ſhame of thy father, nor the ſhame of thy mother, for ſhe is thy mother &amp;c. The very Heathens abhorred this wickednes as moſt vnnaturall and vile. Yea, the Camels (ſaith Ariſtotle) abhorre it by nature, and the Colt will not come néere in this ſort to the Dam; God being pleaſed in brute beaſts to giue vs an example againſt this thing. Hermiene in Euripides could crie, it was barberous. Now, when thus hée nameth father or mother, you muſt not tie the

words to our immediate parents onely, and to immediate children, but the words ſtretch to all the right line of Conſanguinitie either aſcending or deſcending. For as it is vnlawfull for the daughter to marry with her grandfather, or ſo vpward in the ſtreight line; ſo is it for the Father to marrie the Neece, his Neeces daughter, or her daughters daughter, or any other down-ward again in the right line. For all theſe, if you reckon ten thouſand of them, are ſaid to be as parents and children in En ijs qui infra aut ſpeciatim nominantur vſque ad verſe 17: aut ex illorum comparatione, per analogiam intelliguntur. Tremel &amp; Iun.

                         it was euer accounted inceſt, to marry vpward or downeward in the right line.
                     
                     4 The next Lawe is, verſe 8. 1. Cor. 5. 1. 
                        The ſhame of thy fathers wife ſhalt thou not diſcouer: for it is thy fathers ſhame. Hée meaneth the wife of my father, that is, my ſtep-mother, not mine owne mother. Which indéed properly is but Affinitie, but becauſe ſhee is a kind of mother, it is put héere among thoſe that are of Conſanguinitie. The Heathens deteſted this vncleanenes, and therefore S. Paule
                         ſpeaking of it, ſaith, It is heard certainly, that there is fornication among you, and ſuch fornication as is not once named among the Gentiles, that one ſhould haue his fathers wife. Wherefore more monſtrous was the ſaying of the ſtep-mother of Anthonie Caracalla, for when Anthony was ſo bewitched with her beauty, that he deſired to marrie her, and ſighing ſayd. O, if it were lawfull! 
                        O ſi liceret! 
                        She ſhamefully anſwered, if thou liſt, it is lawfull: 
                        Si libet, licet: principes enim dant leges, non accipiunt. 
                        for Princes giue lawes, &amp; take not. A moſt vntrue ſpeach in things concerning the law of nature, as well confelſed Dionyſius, when his mother would haue married otherwiſe than became her age, ſayd, O mother, the ciuil lawes of man may be changed &amp; altered, but the law of Nature may not. The Apoſtle vrgeth this law, you know, in a ſmall matter, as vnchangeable, ſaying, Doth not Nature
                         
                        1. Cor. 11. 14.

                        Natures Law not to bee altred and changed, as by theſe wicked marriages they are. Remember Ruben his inceſt Gen. 35. 22. 2. Sam. 16. 22. with Bilhah; and Abſolons with his fat

                        daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether ſhee be borne at home, or borne without; thou ſhalt not diſcouer their ſhame. This belongeth to the collaterall line, wherein Marriage is not euer forbidden as in the ſtreight line. This Law forbiddeth the ſiſter by both Parents, that is, the full ſiſter, or the halfe ſiſter, the full by both, the halfe by one. For by borne at home, 
                        Alij domi genitam interpretantur in coniugio legitimo &amp;c. Foris genitam extra coniugium. 2 Sam. 13. 14. is vnderſtood the ſiſter borne of an other wife in thy fathers houſe, and by borne without, the ſiſter of thy mother married to an other man out of her houſe, where ſhée dwelled before. Ammons inceſt with Thamar his ſiſter was againſt this Lawe, and many other like matches. Herodotus writeth that Cambyſes King of Perſia coueting to marrie with his ſiſter, aſked his Counſellers, whether there was any Lawe to permit the brother to marrie with the ſiſter? they anſwered after deliberation, that they could finde no Lawe commaunding ſuch marriage, but they found a Law whereby it was permitted to the King of Perſia, to doe what hée liſt. A moſt vile anſwere, when the Queſtion was of the Law of Nature. But you will ſay in the beginning it was thus, that brethren and ſiſters married, and ſuch like. Saint Auguſtin
                         anſwereth; True it is becauſe of neceſſitie, there being then no choyce. But the older this thing may

                     7 The ſhame of thy fathers wiues daughter, begotten

of thy father (for ſhee is thy ſiſter) thou ſhalt not, I ſay, diſcouer her ſhame. This is a repetition, as men thinke, of the Lawe before verſe 9. to ſhew that that Lawe was to be vnderſtood of a ſiſter by the one parent or other, and not of a ſiſter by marriage of father and mother. For the huſbands ſonne by another wife, may marrie with his wiues daughter by an other man, albeit they be brother and ſiſter in lawe.
                     
                     8 Thou ſhalt not vncouer the ſhame of thy fathers ſiſter:

                        for ſhee is thy fathers kinſwoman. Thou ſhalt not vncouer the ſhame of thy mothers ſiſter: for ſhee is thy mothers kinſwoman. Theſe two Lawes concerne the Aunt by father or mother. It is a law of Nature. And as it is not lawfull for the man to marrie his mothers ſiſter, ſo it is not for the woman to bée married to her mothers brother, becauſe theſe perſons be as Parents. So goe on to the great Aunt by father or mother.

Now hée commeth to affinitie, as the Vncles wife by either father or mother, that is, either my fathers brothers wife, or my mothers brothers wife, for theſe are as ſtep-father, or ſtep-mother.

                        in Law; for ſhe is thy ſonnes wife; Therefore ſhalt thou not vncouer her ſhame. This is the neereſt affinitie that is, of the father to his daughter in law, and the mother in law to her ſonne in law. Therefore it is no marriage lawfull. Read Chap. 20, Verſ. 12.
                     11 Thou ſhalt not diſcouer the ſhame of thy brothers

For otherwiſe in thoſe dayes, it was lawfull for the brother to raiſe vp ſéede to his brother, Deut. 25. But now it bindeth vs euer, as appeareth by Iohn to Herod, It is not lawfull for thee to

Theſe horrible inceſts are well knowne to any, and therefore néed no further ſpeach. God giue grace and ſtrength to auoyd them according to our knowledge.
                     13 Thou ſhalt not take a wife with her ſiſter, during 
                        Verſe 18. 
                        her life to vexe her, in vncouering her ſhame vpon her. Know that Moſes héere, hath written but a bréefe of theſe matters, not naming all, but leauing to Naturall reaſon, by theſe examples to vnderſtand all others, which by the ſame Law of Nature are forbidden. Moſes nameth not the Vncle by Father, or Vncle by Mother. But as in genealogies, commonly the mention is of men; ſo in theſe deſcriptions of Marriages, lawfull and vnlawfull, mention is made but onely of women. But the ſame degrees reſtraine both men &amp; women. If any man thinke of ſome marriages of holy men in ſcripture contrary to theſe Rules, let him remember, that wée now liue by lawes and not by examples. What God then either approoued or tolerated, let vs neither raſhly condemne, nor vnaduiſedly follow, but obediently tary within the precin

And again, in theſe caſes let it euer be remēbred, as good reaſon is it ſhould, not only what is lawfull, but what alſo is conuenient and fit to be done. For many things are lawfull which are no way yet expedient, but moſt vnfit in regard of ſome circumſtances.

                     17 From the 26. verſe to the end, you ſée the penaltie

of breaking theſe holy lawes of a pure God, as in the beginning you ſée the profit of kéeping of them. Learne then, that not forreigne foes onely may bring a land to deſolation and deſtruction, but much ſooner and ſoarer, theſe home-bred impurities, which if a godly magiſtrate, maſter, father, or mother kéepe downe, they procure the peace and ſafetie of the land or houſe, more than if they reſiſted violence with armes and weapons. To vomit out her inhabitants and to ſpew out her people, are tearmes of great vehemencie in God, and therefore moſt great ſhould mans feare bée, leſt hée ſhould prouoke him to ſuch ver geance. Sit but with your ſelfe, and meditate of great men and great houſes, meaner men and meaner houſes and you will remember great examples of the effect of an vncleane life in men and women. Happie are they whom other mens harmes do make to beware.
                     
                     18 Although I might héere ſtay vpon theſe things, that haue bin thus bréefly noted, concerning this Chap. and leaue you not without ſome profit: yet for aſmuch as vpon theſe lawes concerning lawfull and vnlawfull marriages, many points fall often to be ſpoken of, I wil a little further procéed, and acquaint you with the good labours of ſome writers, which you by your ſelfe, peraduenture, otherwiſe ſhall not obtaine and get knowledge of. And firſt, concerning marriage it ſelfe, in generall, let it euer be duely conſidered, that as vnlawfull and impure coniunction of man and woman is deteſted of God, ſo is holy &amp; lawfull matrimonie, with him euer accepted, and allowed, and crowned with many bleſſings of his fauour and loue, being honourable among all, and the bed vndefiled. The Scriptures are full of the Heb. 13. 4. praiſes of it, and of good aduiſe giuen to married perſons. Wée haue all béen borne by it, and as God ſhall appoint, may come to it. Let therefore no croſſes worldly, abate the reputation of it in our hearts. Let no popiſh

paraſite trouble vs, that with a foule mouth from a foule heart, calleth that vncleane, which God hath ſanctified. Deceiptfull time-ſeruers, God in time will diſcouer, together with their impurities couertly committed, by contempt of his ordinance appointed for their good, nothing caſting out ſuch an vgly ſent into his noſtrels, as their forced chaſtitie, indeed very monſtrous villanie, doth. Till then, ſcorne them that ſcorne God, and if they thinke you incumbred, know you them to be tormented within and without, a further torment tarying for them, when God his time ſhall be. In policie to deſtroy pietie, will prooue but bad policie in the end, if this Chapter be true, which wée know cannot deceiue. But marriage muſt bée according to theſe Rules of Conſanguinitie &amp; Affinitie, about which if any doubt ariſe, that by this Chapter you plainly cannot diſcuſſe, it ſhall be ſafe to conferre with men learned in the lawes of God and men. The Ciuill lawe reckoneth degrees one way, and the C
                              〈…〉
                           non law an other way. The Ciuill kéepeth this Rule ſtill, that looke how many perſons there are, ſo many degrees there are, taking 
                        Quot ſunt perſonae, tot ſunt gradus, vna dempta, ſcilicet ſtipite.
                         
                        one away, to wit, the roote.
                         The C
                              〈…〉
                           on lawe ſtretcheth reſtreynt further than Gods word doth, therfore idle in that reſpect, there being no tranſgreſſion where no law of God is. Concerning marriage, many queſtions happen by occaſion to be both thought of and ſpoken of, whereof I will giue you a taſte.
                     
                        Firſt, ſéeing nothing is more contrary to marriage than want of conſent, Marriage, indéed, being but a conſent of two fit perſons to goe together in ſuch ſort, according to the will of God,
                         and nothing more contrary to conſent than error and compulſion, of both theſe, there ariſeth queſtion. And firſt of Error or miſtaking, whether it doth make a marriage voyd or no? Anſwere is made, that Error or miſtaking is of foure ſorts; namely, of Fortuna. Qualitatis. Perſonae Conditionis. 
                        Fortune, of Qualitie, of Perſon, &amp; of Condition.
                        
And for the two firſt, the Rule is, that error of Fortune or qualitie excludeth not Conſent of Marriage. But the error of the two latter, Namely, of perſon and condition, doth. Now error or miſtaking of Fortune, is when the Man taketh his Bride, or Shée her Bridegroome to be richer thā he prooueth to be. Error of Qualitie, when the Bride is thought to be honeſt, chaſte, modeſt, painfull and a good huſwife, when in déed ſhée is de
                           ••
                        led, drunken, ſlouthfull, and a waſter. Error of Perſon, is when to the woman is betrothed the eldeſt ſonne, and the youngeſt by deceipt giuen her. This was Iacobs caſe, who expected Rachel and had Leah, but his conſent after, made it a marriage. Error or miſtaking Gen. 29. 23. of Condition is when the man or woman is thought free, and in déed is bond, which in old times was wont to diſlolue matrimonie, but if the man knew it before, it was no cauſe of breach: Yet if his happe was to light of a woman defiled in ſteade of an honeſt, it might not diſſolue the marriage, although the error was a great deale worſe, than to marrie a bond-woman in ſtead of a free. Neuertheleſſe in ſome Conſiſtories of forreigne Countreys, if a man finde ſuch an error, and accuſe her, and pray to be ſeperated, this order is kéept. Firſt, if the woman deny it, and the man cannot plainly prooue it, although he haue ſhrewd ſuſpicions, hée ſhall not put her away, the 22. of Deut. playnly forbidding it. But if the fact be euident by béeing with childe, &amp;c. Then the Iudge firſt perſwadeth a reconciliation, willing the woman with all ſubmiſſion to pray pardon and forgiuenes at the mans hands, and wiſhing the man compaſſionately to remit it vpon a newe life, it being not done in his time. If the man will not bée mooued ſo to doe, then in the third place, the Iudge diligently inquireth, whether after it was knowne, the man had euer knowledge of the womans bodie, and if hée had, then ſhall he be remedileſſe and

take her, if he had not, the next Queſtion is whether ſhee was abuſed after ſhée was betroathed to the man or no? if ſhe were, then as an adulterer ſhe is iudged, if it were before ſhe was betroathed, and the man, after he knew it, touched her not, neither can be perſwaded to remit it, as an Adulterer alſo ſhe is ſentenced the 22. of Deutro. requiring her to bée put to death, who being defiled, yet after marrieth as a mayd and ſo deceiueth him that knew not of it. Thus did euen the honeſter Heathens alſo cenſure ſuch women, as you may ſée in the Tragedie of Euripides called Ion.
                         And thus of Error in miſtaking.
                     
                        Queſtion againe is ſometime mooued touching a Vowe. 
                        vowe, whether that doe hinder marriage or no. And true anſwere is made, that a vowe made by man or woman to liue ſole &amp; chaſte, who finde not that power and gift giuen them of God, hindreth them not from the remedie and ordinance of God againſt it in that behalfe. Becauſe mans vowe againſt Gods will may not binde, and Gods will is, that ſuch as féele cauſe Numb. 30. 6. ſhould marrie 1. Cor. 7. Againe, if a vowe in a thing poſſible and lawfull might not binde againſt ſhe wil of an earthly father or ſuperior, how much leſſe muſt it Vinculum iniquitatis. Quidam nubentes poſt votum aſſerunt adulteros, Ego autem dico vobis, quod grauiter peccant, qui tales diuidunt. lib. 1. Epiſt. dict. 28.

                     A third Queſtion, Whether Spirituall kindred, (as they call it) growing by Chriſtning a childe, or béeing Godfather at the Byſhop &amp;c, hinder marriage? The anſwere is, that God hath no ſuch lawe, but mans couetouſnes was the inventor of it, making many reſtraints, to get the fée thereby of many diſpenſations. We are all the ſpirituall ſonnes and daughters of God, and yet may marrie except in caſes by him forbidden, whereof

this is none, that if ſhee and I chriſtned a childe together, or if I were Godfather to her childe, I may not after marrie with the mother of the childe, and ſo foorth.
                     
                        Fourthly, whether a man may marrie her whom formerly hée hath adulterouſly abuſed in her huſbands life time? Auſwere, No, by the Canon Law, and ſurely they had much reaſon to diſlike of ſuch matches.

                        Fiftly, diuerſitie of Religion
                         whether doth it breake marriage? The anſwere is, No, and theſe ſcriptures ſo teach vs. If any brother haue a wife that is an vnbeleeuer and ſhee conſent to dwell with him, let him not put her away. And if any woman haue an vnbeleeuing huſband, 
                        Verſe 13. 
                        who conſenteth to dwell with her, let her not put him away. For the vnbeleeuing husband is ſanctified by 
                        Verſe 14. 
                        the wife, and the vnbeleeuing wife is ſanctified by the huſband 1. Cor. 7. If any man come vnto me, and do not hate his wife and children, and brethren and ſiſters (to wit, thinking ill in Religion, or going about to draw him away) he cannot be my diſciple. Luke 14. 26. Therefore ſuch a wife a man may haue, and yet his wife. Let the wiues be ſubiect to their husbāds (meaning although happily differing in Religion) that euen they which obey not the Word, may without the Word bee wonne by the conuerſation of the wiues 1. Pet. 3. 1. After, the Church forbad ſuch Marriages to be made, as the Iſraelites were forbidden to marrie with Strangers, leſt by ſuch Wiues they might be allured and drawn from God vnto Idolatrie, as was the wiſeſt man that euer was Salomon. Read Deut. 7. Exod. 34. Ioſua. 23. Eſra 10. Nehem. 
                        Quomodo poteſt congruere charitas, ſi diſcrepet fides? &amp;c. 13. &amp;c. And ſtill it is good to continue this care, for it is the chiefe band of loue, when both hearts be knit in God. * And how can there bée an agreeing loue, where

there is a diſagreeing faith? ſaith Saint Ambroſe.
                         And therefore beware, O Chriſtian, how thou giueſt thy Daughter to a Gentile or a Iew. But when two are alreadie married diſſenting in Religion, they may not by colour thereof be put a ſunder. as Anabaptiſt, vſe to forſake their wiues. The ſafe way is to looke before hand, and ſo may you preuent many a twitching griefe in the heart, that will ariſe if you draw two wayes. Examples there are too many knowne vnto you of this thing. Inward woe, &amp; outward ſhame with much charge and coſt ſome endure by their wiues wilfulneſſe, when their children might alſo be better brought vp, but I ſtay my ſelfe. It is a biting thought to conſider, that one halfe of me dayly ſerueth the Diuell.
                     
                        Sixtly, yet force and compulſion, you will ſay, is contrarie to marriage, becauſe it is contrarie to a free conſent. In déede it is a great wrong, to compell children againſt their wils to marrie with ſuch as they abhorre. For what peace can be where loue is not? Nay, what miſchiefe will not there créepe in, as brawlings, raylings, hatred, neglect of childrens education, of houſhold affaires, and many times, vnfaithfulneſſe of the one towards the other, which God plagueth, and the world ſpeaketh ſhame of. In a word, what comfort either in ſickeneſſe or health, or any way? But yet, if a marriage bée thus made, although the Childe, (if at libertie) would not haue ſo married, it is a marriage and muſt ſtand.
                     
                        Seauenthly, for one that is violently taken away, what ſhall wée ſay? Surely, the Ciuill Lawe appointed, that a Mayd taken away ſhould neuer marrie with the perſon that ſo did take her; but ſhould haue all his goods. And if ſhée did marrie with him, then ſhould ſhe neuer bée capable of any goods of his, and if the Father would conſent to ſuch a marriage, hée ſhould bée baniſhed. But the Canon Lawe determineth otherwise,

Namely, that if the Mayde taken away willingly conſented, and the Parents alſo afterward, Romani Sabinas, &amp;c. apud Herod. pag. 1. alia exempla. then hée that ſtale her away, after penance done, might marrie her.

                         you may héere take occaſion to thinke of it, and to remember, that it is a very auncient and commendable thing in the Church of God, thus to bée betrothed with conſent of friends, before the day of full marriage. There are diuers Treatiſes of it which you may read. With conſent of friends I ſay, becauſe ſo the Scriptures teach and much vrge, giuing the Father authoritie to denye his Childe, although ſhée haue béen carnally knowne, if hée doe not like, Exodus 22; and if hee will conſent, the offender ſhall both marrie her and indowe her, whether hée will or no, ſuch a thing is the Parents authoritie in marriage.

                         14. Of Abraham for his ſonne Iſaac, and Iſaac for his ſonne Iacob, what doe you read? As alſo how it grieued them that Eſau was ſo Gen. 28. 26. diſobedient as to marrie without their conſents. And as was noted before in the Queſtion of a vowe, if a promiſe made by a Childe to God without conſent of 
                        Numb. 30. 6. 
                        Father might not ſtand, much leſſe muſt a promiſe made to man bée good without Parents allowance. For the Ciuil Lawes of men, ſurely ſo did they inſiſt vpon this conſent, that if the Father bée abſent, and it vnknowne either whether hée is dead, or whether hée bée aliue; yet require they, that the childe ſtay thrée yeares, to ſée if hée may bée heard of, and his conſent had. And they will not admit that childe that is borne of one married without this conſent, vnleſſe it bée ſuch a match as is apparant the Father would not haue miſliked, if hée had béen preſent. The Canons in like ſort, altogether confirme this conſent of Parents aledging

that example of Rebecca, and ſaying. Honorantur Rebeccae parentes muneribus, conſulitur puella, non de ſponſalibus (illa enim expectat iudicium parentum, non eſt enim Virginalis pudoris eligere maritum) ſed iam deſponſata viro, de profectionis die conſulitur &amp;c. The Parents of Rebecca are honoured with giftes, and the Mayde is asked, but not touching the marriage, (for therein ſhee reſted vpon the iudgement of her Parents, it not agreeing with a Maydens modestie, to chuſe a huſband) but being promiſed to a man ſhee is asked concerning the iourney. &amp;c.
                         In Euripides alſo, whereſo-euer hée had it, a Mayde is brought in ſaying,

                         Uery Naturall reaſon againe, telleth and teacheth, that a childe, bred vp with ſuch care and charge of Parents many yeares, ſhould not at the ende requite all their loue ſo, as to diſpoſe of himſelfe, or herſelfe in a ſtate that dureth to death, without their priuitie, aduiſe, and conſent. And the moſt vndutifull childe that euer was, if hée or ſhée liue to haue a childe, would not bée ſo ſerued by that childe. Let then Gods Lawe, and mans Lawe, Naturall reaſon, and common honeſtie preuaile with all good Children, to performe this dutie to their Parents, and let good Parents againe, not neglect in due time to prouide fitt matches for their Children, whereby their vertue and good report may remayne without blot or blemiſh not ſtanding euer vppon the heapes of traſh to bée had, but chiefly of Religion and Honeſtie. Such Parents as are faultie

this way, being verie well able to giue that which is conuenient for the preferment of their Children, it is to be wiſhed, that the Chriſtian Magiſtrate would compell them, as hath béen vſed in good gouernments and ſtates. Certainly, it is a tyrannie ouer their children that is moſt worthy of puniſhment and amendment. The diſparagement that hath growne to good houſes this way, is too well knowne, and the ſpoyle of thoſe that might haue béene a comfort to their friends by well doing, if their Parents would haue done their duties, is to be lamented as often as it is thought of. Had I wiſt, (ſaith the old prouerbe) commeth euer too late: And I pray God worke in the hearts of all Parents to thinke of it, whileſt they haue time to preuent euill.
                     
                        Ninthly, touching ſecret contracts, they haue euer béene odious to God and his Church, and therefore as many as regard either, will beware of them and auoide them. And if any ſuch thing be done, diſcreet Gouernours haue held this courſe according to good Lawes. Firſt, if a partie claime a promiſe denyed by the other partie, and haue no proofe at all of it, not ſo much as one witneſſe, but onely offereth to ſweare it, in that caſe no oath ſhalbe taken, neither ſhall the partie procéede to vexe the other, but muſt ſimply giue ouer and be quiet. But if he or ſhe can prooue it by due teſtimonie, a day is appointed for both to appeare, and firſt the Complainenant is to be heard apart, and his tale layd downe with all circumſtances, then is the Defendant called, and required to anſwere euerie point of the former tale, and if ſo truth cannot appeare, then to Witneſſes, &amp;c. The Canon Law is much to blame in this point, yéelding more to theſe ſecreat contracts than it ſhould be, ſo croſſing both the Law of God and Nature, as alſo of good Emperours and Gouernours in their time.

either with conſent of Parents or without; either pure or conditionall; either certaine or vncertaine: &amp;c. Words of the preſent time, when it is ſayd, I doe take you for my Husband; I doe take you for my Wife. Words of the future time, when it is ſayd, I will take you. The firſt of theſe formes doth bind, ſo that if either part breake and marrie elſewhere, that actnall Marriage is to be diſſolued, and the former contract ratified, yea, although they haue lyen together; but the latter forme bindeth not but may be altered, and the parties marrie otherwiſe, if they diſlike before marriage. Publique Contracts are when the Miniſter and other honeſt friends and Witneſſes are preſent; Secret when none but the parties either to other paſſe promiſe, the former hath conſent of Parents, the later hath none, and therefore is wicked and ſinfull. Conditionall Contracts are with conditions honeſt and lawfull, or otherwiſe: honeſt and lawfull condition performed make the Contract good; diſhoneſt and vnlawfull although perfourmed, make no lawfull Marriage, &amp;c. Certaine Contracts are when the partie is certaine, as this Daughter by name; vncertaine when the partie is vncertaine, as I will marrie one of the Daughters, naming none. Of all which points, the Law hath large diſcourſe and many queſtions, which you may beſt learne of them that are Profeſſors of that knowledge, vnto whoſe good aduiſe, (as I ſaid before) I hold it the ſafeſt way euer to haue recourſe vpon any occaſion. For a building well made and vpon firme ground, will ſtand with comfort againſt all aſſaults and obiections, caſt out either by Satan deſirous to trouble our conſciences, or by euill tongues enuying our peace.
                     
                        Tenthly, touching Poligamie, whether it is lawfull for any man at once to haue two or more wiues. The truth is plaine; No. For God made but one Adam
                         and Gen. 1. 26. Gen. 2. 22. 
                        one Eue,
                         that neither man might expect moe Wiues, nor woman, moe Husbans at once than one. And in this firſt

inſtitution, expreſly it was ſaid. A man ſhall leaue father 
                        Gen. 2. 24. 
                        and mother and cleaue to his wife,
                         not wiues, and they two, not they three or more ſhall bee one fleſh.
                         Alſo when Lamech brake this Lawe by hauing moe wiues, and Gen. 4. 19. after him both Iewes and Gentiles followed this libertie; Chriſt the true teacher calleth them to the firſt inſtitution, and plainely ſaith, From the beginning it was 
                        Mat. 19. 8. Mat. 19. 5. 1. Cor. 7. 2. 
                        not ſo, repeating the former Scripture, they two ſhall be one. &amp;c. The Apoſtle S. Paul
                         following this truth, ſaith, for auoyding of fornication, let euery man haue his wife,
                         not wiues; &amp; let euery woman haue her owne husband, not Verſe 3. Verſe 4. 
                        husbands. Againe, let the husband giue to his wife due beneuolence, not to his wiues; And the wife hath not power of her owne body, but her husband. Let a Byſhop 
                        1. Tim. 3. 2. 
                        be the husband of one wife,
                         not of many, as then was vſed of too many; ſtill and euer vſing (as you ſée) the ſingular number, not the plurall. Further, you know that marriage repreſenteth the couenant betwixt Chriſt and his Church, and therefore is called a myſterie, but Chriſt 
                        Ephe. 5. 32. hath onely one Church, and the Church hath onely one Chriſt, therefore pluralitie of wiues or husbands is a fault, and may not be indured. The good peace and vnitie

Therefore very Reaſon teacheth vs to abhorre Polygamie. Good Gouernours mooued herewith, haue euer by their imperiall and godly lawes puniſhed it and forbidden it, as might be ſhewed if it were fit.
                     But you will ſay, the godly Fathers in the old Teſtament had many wiues &amp; God ſuffered it: &amp;c. You muſt then againe conſider with your ſelfe touching them, that ſuffering and allowing or commanding differ much. Suffered it was, commaunded or allowed ſimply neuer. Secondly, latter lawes take away former, and Chriſt by calling men to the firſt inſtitution of Marriage tooke away

that permiſſion and ſufferance of Moſes. Thirdly, Priuiledges doe not ouerthrow a rule. And therefore, although Priuilegia non euer tunt regulam. Gen. 22. 17. 
                        God hauing promiſed to make Abrahams ſeede as the ſtarres of the heauen for multitude
                         was pleaſed to ſuffer varietie of wiues for a time, as a fit meanes ſpéedily and greaſly to increaſe that poſteritie &amp; of-ſpring; yet was not a taking away of his certaine rule, but when the cauſe ceaſed by a multitude procéeding from Abrahams loynes, the thing ſuffered only for that end, ceaſed alſo, and may net any further be followed.

                         that though their huſbands haue diuers wiues, yet they

did by al means indeauor to continue in loue with him. and when he dieth, ſhe that was beſt beloued, with great ioy and glorie that ſhe was ſo, goeth into the fire with his Corps and burneth with his dead bodie. Such continuing affection in thoſe that know not God, muſt needs be a condemnation to all tickle tickle ſtarting aſide in ſuch as know God, and his commaundement in this behalfe. Holy, conſtant, and continued Matrimonie is like (ſay ſome) to that little Citie Zoar, where Lot was ſaued, when to the Mountaine he was unwilling to goe, and in filthy Sodom
                         could not be ſafe. To liue licentiouſly, is to liue in Sodom, to liue ſingle (hauing the gift) is to eſcape into the mountaine. Such as flying from the one, cannot attaine to the other hauing not the gift giuen of God, in litle Zoar,
                         that was betwirt both, that is, in holy wedlocke, which is the middle eſtate, may be ſaued. Euer therefore make much of it, and lightly and vniuſtly breake not in ſunder that holy knot. Sweetneſſe is the Siſter of Loue, as bitterneſſe is the Siſter of hatred. Marriage loue then being an holy loue, will in all troubles taſt contentment and comfort though not one way, yet another, ſtill to the preſeruing of the knot, and of Chriſtian cohabitation. The two Kyne that carried the Arke of God kept one path &amp; turned neither to the right 1. Sam. 6. hand, nor to the left: ſo ſhould married couples doe ſaith S. Gregorie,
                         ſeeing by the profeſſion of the Chriſtian faith they alſo carry the Arke. If the Glaſſe which you looke in ſhould returne your countenance ſad when you are merie, or merrie when you are ſad, were it not a great fault in the Glaſſe? Certainly ſo is it, if married couples differ and be not merrie together, ſorie together, contented together, and either of them euer as a true glaſſe to the other, ſhewing ſuch agréement as is fit for them, till God and time ſhall breake their dayes of, and take the one of them to him.

The bodie hath his grace from the head, and will be ruled by the head in all things without gain-ſaying. The man, you know, is the womans head, Epheſians 5. Women had their v

Vaſhti her refuſall to come when the King ſent for her, turned to her hurt you knowe; and

                           eſt. 1. the example of ſuch diſorder is deſired by all the Wiſe to bée preuented. Sara is propoſed to all vertuous women to bée followed in her ready, louing, and conſtant obedience to her husband Abraham,
                         calling him Lord, &amp;c.
                     
                     The third Vertue of renowned Liuia
                         was you ſaw, that ſhee buſily pryed not into her husbands actions, neither medled with his matters but left his place and the workes of it vnto him, herſelfe dealing with

her owne duties. And what a thing is this to preſerue loue and peace euer betwixt couples? Iezabels ſuch 1. Kin. 21. 7. medling with the matter of Naboth, wounted Ahab, ouerthrew herſelfe, and the ignominie of it liueth and will neuer dye. Stories doe yéeld vs many other examples, and I would our owne times yéelded vs none. I ſpeake of vnfit curioſitie, and not of any good concurrence in well-doing. For wee all know, Pilate had been happie, if in that matter of his Office 
                        Mat. 27. 19. and of Iuſtice, hee had hearkened to his Wiues dutifull wiſh, and not proocéeded as hée did, againſt the Lord Jeſus, Thus remayneth honourable Liuia
                         the Empreſſe a worthy Example to all of her Sexe, how to liue in Loue and Peace with their husbandes, ſo that no diuorce ſhall bée either ſpoken or thought of during life, but longing wiſhes for contynuance many yeares, and euen to bée the later of the two, that goeth to the earth. For ſuch Wiues, as they were worthy ones whiles they liued, ſo will they bée miſſed and many times thought of, when they bée gone. Héere might I ſtay, but ſince I am entred into this matter, giue mée leaue to adde two or three things more, beeing euer-ſhining Vertues in Women, and great meanes of Loue, Amitie, and Vnitie betwixt married couples. Faithfulneſſe to their Husbands is one, I meane a true conſtancie of heart, preferring their wel-doing, before all men and matters whatſoeuer worldly. Such as was in Zipporah Moſes his Wife, who moſt tenderly louing her Childe, and therefore very loath to ſhedde any of his blood, yet when ſhée ſaw her Husband in danger, for omitting that Circumciſion, rather than hee ſhall miſcarrie, ſhee 
                        Exod. 4. 25. addreſſeth her-ſelfe and that ſpéedily to doe that dutie, whereby her Husband might liue, although her childe ſmarted. And ſhee did it not in a furie, (as ſome haue taken the place) but in a moſt faithfull affection,
                        
to the preſeruation of her husband like a louing wife. Neither doe her wordes Sponſus tu mihi es ſanguinum, Thou art a husband of blood vnto me,
                         ſound foorth anger and choler, but ſweetneſſe and loue; as if ſhée had ſaid, My loue to thee hath been ſuch, (deere husband,) as that it hath made me forget woman-hood, to lay aſide all motherly affection, and to redéeme thy life, and contynuance to mée, with the blood of my childe, &amp;c. Such againe, was that in Michal to Dauid her husband, 
                        1. Sam. 19. 11. when ſhe let him downe at the window to eſcape from her fathers furie, and layd an Image in the bed as if hée had béene there ſicke. Such the care of Abigael, when ſhée heard her husband had ouer-ſhot himſelfe toward Dauids meſſengers, rather than any hurt ſhould come to 1. Sam. 25. him for ſuch vnaduiſed ſpeaches, ſhée prepared a very honourable Preſent, and goeth her ſelfe to preuent anger, which ſhée did indéede, to the ſafetie of her husband and all his. Such the loue of Theopompus his wife, who when her husband was taken and put in priſon by his enemies, getting leaue to go into the priſon to him on a time, gaue him her clothes to eſcape in, and ſhee taking his, remained in his place, to abide any danger that might enſue, rather than hee ſhould be oppreſſed by his foes. Such thoſe worthy women, that when the Citie was beſieged by Frederick Barbaroſſa, and at laſt licence giuen to the women, that they might depart taking onely ſuch things with them as they could themſelues cary, in ſtead of any worldly riches which they inioyed, they tooke vpon their backes and vnder their armes, their husbands and children, parents and kinſfolks, to the eternal praiſe of their vertue, and the great aſtoniſhment of their enemies that looked on and ſaw it. Vnfaithfulneſſe and treacherie to husbands, hath left an other report in Stories, if I ſhould enter into it. But ſuch hatefull things are better forgotten and neuer knowne. Theſe gracefull Vertues let all gracious women
                        
thinke of, and leaue behinde them the like praiſe.
                     
                        Silence, againe, or little ſpeach, what a vertue? what

                           . a preſeruer of peace if a woman be bleſſed with it. The contrary, what hurt and bywords hath it wrought? Prouerbio dicitur, Tres mulieres nundinas facere. The Chiliad. Eraſm. 3. Contur. 6. Prouerb. 77. 
                        Prouerbe ſaith, That three women make a fayre. And words are wanting to women as ſinging is to the Nightingale, who is ſayd, to bée onely a voyce, in reſpect of the ſound ſhée giueth foorth being ſo little a Birde; as verſes are wanting to a Poet; Figures of ſpeach to Vbi minus eſt roboris aut cordis, plus est linguae. an Orator; or falſe arguments to a Sophiſter, that is, they abound with them, and often ſuperabound.

                        Few words in a woman is a great ornament.

                        Plutarch. in praeceptis coniugalibus. 
                        Loquitur aut viro, aut per virum: A woman ſpeaketh either to her husband, or by her husband. To her husband,
                         orderly and neceſſarily; by her husband, as vnwilling to tattle much with ſtrangers, ſéeking the praiſe of a roling tongue, and looſing paraduenture the renowne of modeſtie and wiſedom. Looke how milke is ſaid to kill the force of Gun-powder, &amp; ſo be euer aſſured that ſoft words or ſilence will do to anger betwixt man and wife. And let theſe things worke a loue of little ſpeach not multiplying wordes with your husband, eſpecially when hée is mooued and grieued with ſome other matters, bying and reuying, and will hée, ſtill he, ſtill hauing the laſt word. For ſurely that doth no good. The old Paynters if they pictured a woman, were euer wont to put vnder her foote a Snayle, aſwell to remember this vertue of ſilence to her, which is in the Snayle, as of carying her houſe vpon her backe as the Snayle doth.
                     Yet ſuch ſilence is meant, as doth not abandon affabilitie and curteſie when there is cauſe, for this alſo is another great preſeruer of loue and amitie, in ſo much that the wiſe man ſaith, Mulier comis exhilerat maritum,

&amp; cum humaniter illum tractat cor illius reficit ac recreat. A gentle and milde woman maketh glad her husband, and when ſhe dealeth courteouſly with him, ſhe refreſheth and recreateth his very heart. Louing ſpeach
                         is a Phiſition to the minde, to cléere it and cleanſe it from much grief. Hee that will take birds, may not come to them with a ſtaffe, (ſaith the old Prouerbe,) but a ſweete ſounding pipe is more auailable, and thinke you that ſhee which will haue her huſbands liking muſt vſe harſh and bitter words? What a power had wiſe Abigael
                         ouer that fierce anger of valiant Dauid
                         with her ſoft words and milde ſpeach, euen when hee had but death and blood in his heart towards her husband and his familie, for the great contempt ſhewed vnto him? Could rough and ſower ſpeaches haue ſo preuailed? No, no, you knowe fire is not quenched with fire, but with cold &amp; ſoft water. Pax &amp; manſuetudo characteres animae piae. Peaceableneſſe and mildeneſſe they are the notes, markes, and 
                           Baſil. 
                           prints of a good minde, and of a holy &amp; Chriſtian ſoule.
                         But this is enough, I will goe no further. Try me and truſt me, you ſhall not repent it. Let the weapons of a woman bée either ſoft words, or modeſt ſilence with a dropping teare if there bée wrong done, and it ſhall pierce a heart of ſtéele, working ſuch effects as all the hote ſpeach that an vnbridled tongue can vtter ſhall not bring foorth.
                     
                        Wiſedome and diſcretion againe in a wife, O powerfull meane to make loue and to doe much good! A wiſe woman (ſaith the Holy Ghoſt) buildeth her houſe: 
                        Prou. 14. 1. Pro. 31. 23. 
                        but the fooliſh deſtroyeth it with her owne hands. By a wiſe woman her husband is knowen in the gate, when hee ſitteth with the Elders of the Land. Strength and honour 
                        Verſe 25. 
                        is her clothing, and in the latter day ſhee ſhall reioyce. Shee openeth her mouth with wiſedome, and the 
                        Verſe 26. 
                        law of Grace is in her tongue, &amp;c.
                     
                     
                        Communitie of things betwixt couples worketh

                        Amitie, and Myne and Thyne betwixt them ſhould not bée heard. They are Yoke-fellowes, and (which is much more) they are one, therefore their diuided goods may not diuide them, but what the one hath the other ought to haue, and bée ioynt poſſeſſours of whatſoeuer God granteth. Let not the man deny what is fit to his wife, for ſhée hath a right; and let not the wife grudge her husband hers, for hee hath a preheminence. If you put water into wine and the water bée more, yet it is ſtill called wine; and euen ſo the womans portion put to the mans is called his, although hers is the greater. If vſe be common and loue hearty, for names and titles of order and cuſtome, wiſe couples will not contend to the quenching of one ſparkle of Loue.
                     
                     
                        Laſtly, an Houſwifely care of her Familie and all things belonging thereunto, cleanlineſſe, order, and ſuch like, as it beautifieth a woman, ſo pleaſeth it a man, and the effect of it is loue and liking. If theſe be not, the contrary followeth. For the firſt, wée all know vnleſſe a getter without, haue a keeper within, hée ſhall bée like one that filleth a veſſell, at the other end whereof one draweth out as faſt as hée putteth in. For the ſecond, it both delighteth and profiteth, things pleaſing more that are freſh and well keept, and laſting longer being not dayly vſed. The third thing, order, what a praiſe it is, may appeare by the conſideration of your graine onely; what a thing it were, if all ſorts ſhould bee put together, Wheat, Rye, Oates, Barley, Peaſe, Beanes, and not euery kinde layde by it ſelfe, It would ouerthrow the vſe and good euen of all, or elſe procure a worke to ſeuer them againe. Theſe things then and ſuch like will worke ſuch Amitie, Vnitie, and Loue betwixt man and wife, that the matter of Diuorce ſhall neuer come in any queſtion, no not in thought, by any man indued with either pietie or reaſon: Wherefore

I haue rather choſen briefly to note them than to ſpeake any thing of Diuorces.
                     
                     But what may ſome ſay? I haue touched many things how a woman ought to behaue herſelfe to worke and continue liking in her husband, and I haue ſaid nothing or little of the mans dutie to the woman. Indéede it is true. Firſt, and more I haue ſpoken of women, becauſe as they are the weaker, ſo they are often the workers of diſcontentment, either through wilfulneſſe, or at the leaſt through want of care to doe otherwiſe; but yet I acknowledge there is a Law alſo for the man, which hée ſhould regard and not breake, deliuered in the Word, and eaſily to bée remembred by good mindes. Bee not as a Lyon in thine owne houſe (ſaith Epheſ, 4. 30. 
                        Wiſe Syrach) nor oppreſſe them that are vnder thee. Huſbands loue your wiues and bee not bitter to them, (ſaith Coloſ. 3. 19. the Apoſtle Paul) and dwell with them (ſaith S. Peter) as men of knowledge, giuing honour to the Women as the weaker veſſels, euen as they that are heyres together of the grace of life, that your prayers may not bee interrupted.
                         Her parents and friends haue committed her to thy truſt, and ſhée herſelfe forſaking father and mother and all the world, hath giuen herſelfe vnto thee, how then may ſhée be vſed ill? ſo could S. Chryſoſtome reaſon. Hom. 26. in 1. Cor. Ariſt. polit. 1. Ca. 1. 
                        Aristotle himſelfe being but a Heathen could finde fault (and moſt iuſtly) with certaine that made no other reckoning of their wiues than of ſeruants. Shall a man contend with his wife? Non habet victoria laudem. There is no praiſe in the victorie, ſaith One well. By ill dealing, Morbus non tollitur, ſed augetur &amp; exaſperatur, The diſeaſe is not taken away, but increaſed and exaſperated.
                         Wherefore in olde times, they did vſe at Marriages to place Mercurie by Venus, and the Goddeſſes of Eloquence 
                        Suadam &amp; Oratias. 
                        and delectable ſpeach, to note that whatſoeuer marryed couples will obtaine one of the other, it muſt be done not by any vnkinde courſe, but by good perſwaſion
                        
and louing ſpeach. And when they offred ſacrifice, they pulled out the gall of the ſacrifice and caſt it away, to ſignifie likewiſe that in marriage no bitternes ſhould be vſed. Thus are men alſo aduiſed by al means to louing carriage of themſelues in all things towards their wiues. Wherefore ſince God commandeth it, and man perſwadeth it, who is hée regarding either God or man that will forget it? Away then with all thoughts of Diuorces, and as men and women that makè account of a Iudgement day, let either part beare with the weakneſſe of the other, and abhorre ſuch crimes as ſhould ſtirre vp to any ſeparation. God in mercie ſtrengthen vs all.
                     Amen.

In the 9. Verſe you read thus, verſe 9. 
                        When you reape the harueſt of your Land, you ſhalt not reape euery corner of your field, neither ſhalt thou gather the gleanings of thy Harueſt. Thou ſhalt not gather

                        the Grapes of the Vine-yard cleane, neither gather euery grape of thy Vine-yard, but thou ſhall leaue them for the poore and for the ſtranger: I am the Lord your God.
                         A worthy Law, euer to teach vs both what care the Lord hath of the poore, and what care wee muſt haue. If wée haue it there are many bleſſings promiſed to it, if wée want it, as fearefull curſes. Yet what coldneſſe poſſeſſeth mans heart who ſéeth not? But when the Lord commanded ſomething to bee left in the field for
                        
was his meaning that of that which came home and was put into the Barne, they ſhould haue nothing? No, no, both in the Fieldes, and out of Barne and Houſe, the poore muſt euer bée remembred, if we meane to heare that ioyfull Speach one day, When I was hungry you fed mee, and when I was naked you clothed mee. But the LORD willed héere preciſely ſome-what to be left in the field becauſe hée knew our corruption which more hardly parteth with a thing alreadie houſed and brought in, than when it is yet abroade in the Field. A Purſe once tyed vpon knots will not eaſily

                        open when it ſhould; and therefore to méete with this hardneſſe and to prouide the better for them hée commandeth a care in the Field before it come in, and yet expecteth the other too as néede requireth. O where is this care with wolrdly men that rake and ouer rake their Fields with greedy minde to haue euen the vttermoſt they can get from it, that gather their fruite ſo, as if they ſée but one Apple left vpon the tree, will rather ſet a Ladder of purpoſe to fetch it downe, than they will goe without it? If any poore come, they are rated, and reuiled, and driuen away, as if they were Dogges rather than Men and Women as wée bee, Children of the ſame Father, Heyres of the ſame promiſes, and redéemed with the ſame price, the precious blood of the Lord Ieſus Christ our Sauiour. Will God euer winke at this wickedneſſe, and proſper theſe thus gotten goods vpon our poſteritie? Thinke of it but in reaſon, and tell me what your conſcience ſaith? The Example of Boaz, God
                         hath left vs in his Word for a good Rule in this kinde worthy a religious and carefull following. Into whoſe Field when Ruth came Ruth 2. 2. to gleane a fewe eares of Corne for her reliefe and her Mother in lawe Naomi, firſt

And then Boaz himſelfe comming called her, when hée knew ſhée was a poore Stranger, and ſayd vnto her, Heareſt thou, daughter, goe to no other fielde to gather,

Here is mercie and pittie to a poore Stranger Chronicled vp in this Booke of GOD, that his Fame may neuer dye who ſhewed it, that it may teach vs that liue, and that it may condemne all churliſh gréedy gripple Natures to the worldes end. O, let it profite you, &amp; let the poore man bow before you &amp; bleſſe you for your cōfort, as ſhe did here to Boaz. Again, foraſmuch as harueſt time is the time of your receiuing at Gods hands a great largeſſe &amp; bountifull Almes, your Fruites of Hay and Corne, of Grapes and all good gatherings, therefore at that time eſpecially the hand that receiueth ſhould giue, thankfully towards God, feelingly in it ſelfe, and cheerefully towards the poore receiuer. So, ſo ſhould all be well, and God both giue more and proſper vpon poſteritie what hée giueth, which otherwiſe by all the Lawyers in the world, and all the perpetuities in the world cannot be ſo tyed to your ſéede, but that God will blow both it and them away. And when wée thus ſpeake of giuing the poore their part, doe you thinke God his owne part muſt bée imbeſſeled and taken away, I meane your due and true tythe? No, no, if the creature muſt not be defrauded, much leſſe muſt Mal. 3. 8. 9. 10 the Creator be robbed. Read the Prophets wordes, and pray for a feeling heart and an open hand according to

                        dutie and right. I cannot forbeare to tell you (in this Note well. place) of a fearefull Iudgement of God, ſhewed not many yéeres agoe in theſe parts, vpon a greedie grudger of his Tythe to them, to whom it was by Lawe due. A Gentleman of good ſort, our neighbour hereby and well knowne to all this Countrey, had the tythes of a Parſonage, and by the right thereof demaunded wooll, of a man alſo rich, and the Owner of many hundreds of ſhéepe. This hard-hearted man ſent a ſmall quantitie, the ſeruants ſhewed it their Maiſter. Hée willed vpon the Holy-day next it ſhould bée brought to the Church that the neighbours might ſée it, who all vpon ſight knew the wrong. The Gentleman demaunded
                         his due; the other denied any more, and withall vowed in choler out of a naughtie heart, that if hée were forced to pay any more, he would neuer kéepe any more ſhéepe, but depriue him of that profite from him. The Lawe forced him, and hée thereupon put away his ſhéepe, euer-after falling ſo in decay (GOD following of him with his wrath for his wicked minde) that the day when the Gentleman was buryed (being not very long after) hée among the reſt of poore people, ſtood to receiue ſuch Almes as was giuen at the Funeralls. Let it ſtrike, O let it mooue vs to thinke with our ſelues what it is to grudge God his Tythe, or any man his due in this ſort, to whom the Lawes we liue vnder iuſtly giue it, and euer pray we againſt a naughtie heart choaked and poyſoned with the loue of this world aboue all care to bée ſaued in the great and fearefull day.

Yet if you deale falſly one with

Baſe and bad perſons ſpend their time in carping, ſlaundering, and ill reporting as though they were ſo much better by howe much they make others worſe. So did Saint Auguſtine that worthy Father

Who can be ſafe in life or limbe, Exod. 23. 3. in lands or goods, if Affection be Iudge. Booteth it to be honeſt or iuſt, or blameles if not Truth, but Fancie try me? No, no. And therefore bleſſed bée God for Law and Iuſtice, and woe to the Land where Affection ruleth. Honeſtius eſt cum iudicaueris amare, quam cum amaueris iudicare. It is farre better to loue when thou haſt iudged, than to iudge when thou loueſt. Clamat pauper &amp; nullus exaudit, clamat diues &amp; quilibet applaudit: The poore man cryeth, and no man heareth, the rich man cryeth, and euery man prayſeth and ſmootheth.

It is a ſhrewde blow that killeth thrée at a blowe, and that not in body onely, but in ſoule alſo. The tale-teller killeth himſelfe, &amp; peraduenture twenty

Secret hate then is murder of the heart, and againſt the Commandement. Uſe it therefore at your perill, and ſay God either ſéeth not or regardeth not; Your iudgement at laſt ſhall teach you, hee doth both. For this Law is not idle, nor any Law, Hee giueth to the ſonnes of men.

With diuers ſeedes they ſowe their ground, which follow diuers doctrines in Religion. And linnen and woollen garments are forbidden, either becauſe the Gentiles vſed them, to whom God would not haue his people like, or to note, how hatefull to GOD is a fantaſticall head caryed about with toyes and idle deuiſes.

haue planted euery tree for meate you ſhall count the fruite thereof vncircumciſed three yeares, and it ſhall not bee eaten, &amp;c. A mercifull prouidence for poſteritie: for if a Trée be ſuffered to beare too ſoone, as the firſt, ſecond, or third yeare, it doth not vſually indure long, but decayeth ſooner than otherwiſe it would, the fruite draweth away the nouriſhment which ſhould make the roote and trée ſtrong.

The LORD ſéeth them and thinketh of them, though they little thinke of themſelues, and of their malicious actions. Thirdly, it ſhadowed how little worth the fruites of youth vſually are either to the Church or Common-wealth, till yeares haue bred ſtrength of iudgement, and made them both ſée and doe what is profitable.

                         And the fifth they might begin to eate. This Conſecration of one yeare to the Lord, ſheweth how due from man, and accepted of God, true and heartie thankfulneſſe is. Secondly, that God 
                        Deut. 26. would haue them acknowledge the fruites of trees, aſwell as of the earth by corne, to procéede of Gods goodneſſe, mercie, and prouidence, without all deſert

or merit of theirs. Thirdly, that they were to vſe them as all other his good gifts, ſoberly, temperately, &amp; orderly, not ryotouſly &amp; wantonly, as too many now a dayes do giuing ſo, &amp; ſo much for a few Cherries, or ſuch like, when there is no cauſe in Phiſicke for health, or ſo foorth: but onely wantonneſſe and luxurie, little thinking how vile themſelues are, if God ſhould looke vpon them in Juſtice, or how many néedie naked ſoules, as déere to God as they, want, and would be glad of one penny or halfe penny of that mony ſo wantonly without cauſe beſtowed vpon their belly.

And neither of theſe is forbidden, as farre as their is any naturall reaſon and cauſe, which is in fore-ſhewing of raine and tempeſts, and alteration of weather. For example, long obſeruation hath found it, and good writers agrée of it, that the continuall crying of the night Owle all the night long, prognoſticateth death: ye gathering together of many Rauens playing and crying, fore-tell faire weather: Chickens crying lowde, Et ſtudioſe quaerentes pedunculos.

Whereat when the Southſayer and many of the Hoſte were offended, hée anſwered, that it was a foule ſhame for ſo many worthy men, to ſeeke knowledge of her, that knew not what ſhould happen to herſelfe. For if ſhe had, ſhe would not haue come there, or not ſitten til he had ſhot: and ſo the matter was laughed out, and the feare gone.

Wée in theſe dayes are wholely giuen to forreigne faſhions, the Lord in mercie ſaue vs from forreigne ſuperſtition, and continue his Goſpell and peace vpon Iſrael, preuenting &amp; confounding their purpoſes that craftily indeauour the ſupplanting of both Trueth and Peace, vnder the colour of policie and ſafetie, &amp;c. The cutting and marking of their fleſh was alſo Heatheniſh.

                        and the Land bee full of wickedneſſe. This is a Branche of the Commandement againſt Adulterie, admoniſhing Parents to looke to their houſes, and Magiſtrates to looke to the Land, that there be no Stewes, nor places of ſinne ſuffered for any colour whatſoeuer, as is in Rome for gaine, euen an yearely Reuenue. The power of Satan ouer Heathens in this matter was fearfull, and therefore the Lord admoniſheth his people to beware of their faſhions and ſinnes. The Cyprij (ſay our Bookes) before the marriage of their daughters &amp; maydens, appointed certaine dayes &amp; places when &amp; where they were to come together, ſo to rayſe a dowrie &amp; marriage portion for them. The Locrenſes thought it was a way to pleaſe their gods, to proſtitute their Uirgins, and therefore in any diſtreſſe and danger of warre and the like, they would make vowes, that if they might haue victorie and bée deliuered, ſo and ſo many maydens, vpon a ſolemne Feaſt appointed for that purpoſe, ſhould bee proſtituted. Theſe horrible things ſerue to ſhew vs the corruption of our nature, and the blindnes entred into our vnderſtanding by the firſt fall,
                        
till God renue vs by his holy Spirit, and giue vs the light of his Word, as alſo to ſtirre vs vp to thankfulneſſe to our moſt gracious God for better knowledge vouchſafed to vs, whereby wée are kept from being ſuch beaſts and monſters, as theſe Heathens were, and men ſtill are, without him.

                     CHAP. XX.
                     
                        THis Chapter repeateth Lawes mentioned before, adding puniſhments 
                        The ſumme of this Chapter. to the breakers of them, which before was not done. It ſhall not therefore be néedfull to goe ouer them all againe particularly, but leaue you to conferre them your ſelf, which you may doe by helpe of the quotations in the Margent of your Bible, referring you to the former places where the ſame Lawes were mentioned, without addition of that puniſhment which here now is layd downe. Onely for order ſake, I will giue you theſe few obſeruations.
                     1 In laying downe ſeuerall paynes and puniſhments for the breakers of his Lawes, the Lord teacheth that Common-wealths and gouernments doe ſtand and are preſerued, aſwell by puniſhments of the euill, as by rewards of the good, and that as néedfull therefore is the one as the other. If either reward or good examples of

ſuch as loue obedience would ſerue, it were beſt, but it neuer would, nor wil, the leſſer part being euer ſo led, and the greater by feare of paynes. The ſaying is olde and true, It is as great a vertue to keepe what is gotten, as firſt to get it; and euen ſo, is it as good a dutie in a Magiſtrate to ſée Lawes kept, as at firſt to make them. And ſince they will not be kept of all without puniſhments, therefore puniſhments are moſt neceſſarie. Idle then and abſurde was it in thoſe Heretickes, that argued God not to be Author of the Olde Teſtament, becauſe there are ſo many puniſhments mentioned and executed. For is it a fault in a Chirurgion to cut of a corrupt part for the ſauing of the whole? So in the Magiſtrate, it is no crueltie but vertue to preferre the ſafetie of many before the will and liking of one.
                     2 The puniſhments héere threatned and appointed for Idolatrie and Idolaters is very worthy noting. Whoſoeuer (ſayth GOD) ſhall giue his children to Molech, 
                        Verſe 2. (an Idoll of the Ammonites, as you ſawe before, vnto whom they burned and ſacrificed their children 2. Kin. 23. Verſe 10. and by this one kinde, the Lord vnderſtandeth all kindes of Idolatrie) that perſon ſhall the people of the land ſtone to death. But what if they bée negligent? ſée the ſeueritie of God againſt this ſinne. Then will I (ſaith God) ſet my face againſt that man, and
                         
                        Verſe 3. verſe 4. 
                        cut him off from among his people; Yea, I ſay againe, If the people of the Land hide their eyes and winke at that offender, and kill him not, then will I ſet my face againſt 
                        Verſe 5. 
                        that man and againſt his familie, and will cut him off, and all that goe a whoring after him, &amp;c. Why Lord, why ſo? Becauſe hee hath defiled my Sanctuarie and polluted my holy Name.
                         See, in theſe tearmes, the nature of Idolatrie: yet there is mercie with the Lord, and great patience. Tempt him not therefore, but meditate of theſe Examples. Salomon
                         fell to Idolatrie, and what a iudgement did God ſhew vpon his houſe in his ſonnes

entrance: Rehoboam, by cutting off for euer from him ten of the Tribes? Manaſſes
                         was an Idolater, the people followed him, and what did the Lord to him, till he ſaw his fall and was moſt ſorry for it? The whole ſtate of the Iewes, how was it ouer throwne for this wickedneſſe? Read that notable Chapter of Ieremie the Prophet 
                        Iere: from yt 28. verſe forward. It is true may ſome ſay, Idolatrie grieuouſly offendeth God, but what is Idolatrie? Let that perſon know, that euery worſhip not commanded of God is Idolatrie, &amp; the worſhip alſo that is commanded, if it be done in other maner then is commanded. To make it plaine, the worſhipping of God in and vnder yt ſimilitude of a golden Calfe was therefore Idolatrie, becauſe God commanded and appoynted no ſuch thing, were their intent neuer ſo good, &amp; their diſtinction betwixt God &amp; the calfe neuer ſo plainely made. Againe, to offer thoſe ſacrifices which the law appointed, and by God were commaunded, with affiance in yt out-ward worke done, was Idolatrie, becauſe in a thing commanded they did not vſe the maner commaunded. So, ſo, (&amp; God make it enter) is the reading of Leſſons of Scripture, ſaying of Prayers, ſinging of Pſalmes, Faſting, and ſuch like, very offenſiue to God and plaine Idolatrie, when they are vſed with an opinion of merit, &amp; the Lord Ieſus robbed by them of that praiſe that is only due to him, for meriting our reconciliation with God and eternall ſaluation. Beware, beware we then how we kindle the wrath of him againſt vs, that hath here vowed to ſet his face againſt ſuch perſons to cut them off and their Families alſo with them, although the Magiſtrate wink, and will not ſée what the Lord hath willed him both to ſée, and to puniſh. Yea, the Lord will himſelfe bée reuenged both of doer and ſufferer, bée hée Father, Husband, Maſter, Magiſtrate or whatſoeuer, bound by place and Office to looke to ſuch things and to reforme them. And therefore beware of winking at, and ſuffering

what you are able to amend. Great is the good that a willing Superiour may doe, although nor euer what hée would, through the enuie and practiſes of ſome that ſhould not hinder. For it is true, that either ſincerely, or at leaſt ſéemingly inferiours will frame to his will that is ouer them: And ſéemingly I ſay, becauſe all is not euer gold that gliſtereth. And I remember when certaine Embaſſadours prayſed the Lacedemonian ſouldiers
                         for being ſo orderly, who before had béen ſo iniurious, one of them anſwered, No, no; the prayſe is 
                        Nos ijdem ſumus qui &amp; nuper, ſed alius nunc dux eſt &amp;. Xenophon.
                         
                        not ours that wee are thus changed, for wee are the ſame men ſtill, but wee haue now another Captaine, and hee it is that ordereth vs, &amp;c. Thus goe ouer your Chapter, and ſée the ſeuerall puniſhments annexed to euery lawe, and feare his wrath that is ſo ſtrong and iuſt.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXI.
                     
                        Three principall Heads are contained in this Chapter.

                              The Priests mourning for the dead.
                              His Marriage.
                              His bodily qualities.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           COncerning the firſt, the Prieſts in the Law might not lament and mourne for euery one, but for ſuch as here are mentioned, Namely, His kinſ-man that is neere vnto him, by his mother, or by his father, or by his ſonne, or by his daughter, or by his brother, or by his ſiſter; a mayde that is

neere vnto him which hath not had an husband, for her hee may lament, &amp;c. The drift of this whole matter in ſhort, was to reſtraine them from ſuch Heatheniſh faſhions as were then vſed among the Gentiles round about Cic. Tuſc. 3. them, who vſed to cut themſelues, to teare their cloathes, to beate their heads, and fooliſhly many wayes to vſe themſelues. In the 19. Chapter before, this was touched. Ezek. 44. you may reade of it and in the 6. of Baruch, directly contrary to this Law did the Prieſts mourne. Yet euen Gentiles did ſée the folly of much of this, as Bion his ſpeach ſheweth, who teſted at Agamemnons furious pulling of his haire, and ſaide hée pluked it of, as though baldneſſe were an excellent remedie to aſwage griefe.
                        2 That of following his ſiſters Funerall not married, and not following if ſhee were married, was not to derogate any thing from that holy Ordinance of God, but becauſe his ſiſter marryed, was ingrafted into another houſe and familie, and ſo was not the next of kinne in that reſpect.
                        3 The high Prieſt might neither follow father nor mother, nor any. A thing that God would haue to diſtinguiſh the Prieſts among themſelues, and ſo to ſhewe how he not onely liketh and alloweth of degrées among thē, but euen he maketh the ſame degrées, &amp; appointeth ſome higher, &amp; ſome lower, &amp; ſome to doe this, others not to doe that, that reuerence may bée among themſelues one to another, and of all the people to them all. Allegorically this reſtraint of the High Prieſt from that which was then a legall pollution, noted, that in Chriſt was no ſpot, nor blot, nor pollution of any ſort whatſoeuer. And the ſuffering of others to goe, that in them alſo touching themſelues, there was originall corruption aſwell as in others, howbeit their Office was more excellent, and gaue them preheminence aboue other men. Popiſh prieſts ſay, their Prieſt-hood was ſhadowed by

this in the Lawe, yet they vſe ſhauing, and going to Funerals, &amp;c.
                        
                     
                     
                        2.
                        Of the Second Point concerning their Marriage, your Chapter ſayth. They ſhall not take to wife an Whore, or one polluted, neither ſhall they marry a woman diuorced from her huſband, for ſuch a one is holy vnto his GOD. Thou ſhalt ſanctifie him therefore, for he offereth the bread of thy GOD, he ſhall be holy vnto the &amp;c. All which things are thus layde downe to giue credite to his Office and function, and to ſhadow out that the Church, which is the Spouſe of the great High-Prieſt Christ Ieſus,
                            is and ſhould be without wrinkle, a chaſte Virgin, holy &amp; vndefiled by imputation through Chriſt. If Marriage had béen ſuch an vnfit thing for the Prieſts, the Lord could as eaſily haue ſimply forbidden them to marry at all, as thus to haue limited them what manner of women they ſhould marry. But neuer ſhall they ſée, whom God in wrath hath blinded. How plainely héere doth God require reuerence to them and magnifieth their Office, that they offered the bread of God and were holy, yet marryed; but I will not enter into this matter, it hath béene touched before that Marriage euer was honourable among all men and the bed vndefiled. And Let euery man haue his wife and euery woman her husband &amp;c. The heauen and earth were aſhamed (when time was) of their holineſſe that vnder the colour of holineſſe, forbad marriage, and the Lords wrath is vpon the houſes where they dwelt to this day, &amp;c.

taken, as if God reſpected the outward fauour and perſonage of any man. For when Samuel went to annoint Dauid, and ſawe the elder brother a goodly tall man, thinking in himſelfe, this is hée, GOD plainly tolde him, Hee looked not as men doe, vpon the out-ward

                           iudgement, becauſe the noſe diſcerneth good ſauours from euill, as the minde ſhould alſo doe things fit and vnfit. In the Canticles among the praiſes of the Spouſe, It is ſayd, her noſe is like a Tower in Libanon,
                            becauſe by Cant. 7. 4. 
                           iudgement ſhée diſcerneth a farre of temptation and euils comming, as out of a Tower. There are ſome againe that are too quicke and buſie, ſearching and prying further into many matters then they ſhould, and ſo by their buſie factions, and ſeditious heads, by their turbulent and vnquiet wits, ouerthrowing the praiſe of their actions, and theſe are ſayd to haue great noſes or A great Noſe.

                            a bleniſh and that a great one, vnfit for all men, but moſt foule in a Prieſt, and therefore ſuch not admitted to the Altar of GOD.
                            In theſe dayes, what out-cryes by the Secular Prieſts againſt the Ieſuites for this vnquiet humour are 
                              •
                           ubliſhed, you cannot but vnderſtand. They are therefore not ſo fit for the ALTAR as for the old Prouerbe, Buſie muſt haue a band, and ouer-buſie muſt bee hangd.
                           
By broken foote or hand, ſuch as haue no goodneſſe at A broken foote and hand. all in them, not lame as before, but flat without. A crooked backe hath hée, who is bowed and preſſed downe with the care of earthly things, ſo that hée looketh not vp to heauen and future ioyes; but if hée heare any thing thereof, preſently the other plucketh him to his bias againe, like to that ſéede ſowen in ſtonie ground which is choked by earthly and worldly cares. A bleared eye hath hée, who hauing ſome ſenſe and knowledge of good things, yet by an ill cuſtome of bad behauiour is diuerted and ouerthrowne. For in bleared eyes, the candle or ſight of the eye is ſaid to be good, but by a bad humour diſtilling downe, the eye-liddes are hurt and made out of order, ſo grieuing and hindring the ſight of the eye. A Blemiſh in his eye hée is ſaid to haue, who puffed vp with pride and arrogancie, ſeeth not indéede what he is, but as a ſight that is able to ſée, by a white-ſkinne growing ouer is hindred; ſo a man able to ſee and diſcerne good things for his wiſedome, learning, and good naturall partes, through a vile whiteneſſe growing in his eye, that is, a proude conceipt in his minde of his whiteneſſe aboue other men, is made ſtarke blinde, and fooliſh, and abſurd to all wiſe-men. To ſuch therefore it is good counſell which the Lord giueth, To annoynt the eyes with eye-ſalue that they may ſee, &amp;c. The Skiruie is a heate comming from Apoc. 3. 18. the Inwards to the out-ward skinne, and therefore ſuch men noted, as haue inward concupiſence and heat breaking foorth into the outward act of vncleaneneſſe, moſt vnfit for ſuch as are and ought to be holy vnto GOD. The Scabbe, is a foulneſſe ariſing of an Itche, and ſpreading broader &amp; greater if it be not looked vnto, and therby is noted the vice of Couetouſneſſe, which firſt beginneth with an itching deſire, and afterward for want of looking to, ſpreadeth to a great foule vice deforming any man, and moſt vnſéemely in a Prieſt, who ought to

bée cleane. Couetouſneſſe, (ſaith the Apoſtle) is the roote of all euill. Laſtly,
                            by him that hath his ſtones broken, ſuch are noted as though they doe not the act, yet haue euer in their mindes, lewde and vncleane thoughts, whereby they are ſo ſinfully carryed away, as pure and cleane and holy Meditations can take no place. A fruite too well knowne to growe from forced chaſtitie: This burning fire of Hell in any man is damnable, and therefore our gracious GOD
                               hath prouided a remedie. In a man conſecrated to God to meditate in his Word day and night, it is moſtodious. And therefore for no worldly reſpects to be ſuffered by the contempt of Gods Ordinance, if God vouchſafe not the gift of Continencie, which is a vertue in the minde, and not an outward reſtraint of the body onely. Curſed are thoſe policies that deſtroy both body and ſoule in hell-fire. Theſe are the blemiſhes mentioned in your Chapter, which GOD would not haue in his Prieſts, and therefore ſuch as had them, were not admitted to his Altar. How learned men haue laboured to apply them to morall vertues you ſée, and it is very certaine, that ſuch vices of the minde, as haue béen noted, neither then were, nor now are for ſuch as offer the bread of God, but are to bée prayed againſt and taken héede of, to the vttermoſt ſtrength that God giueth, yet happily not intended by the Law. And therefore, I rather like to leaue theſe applications as the conceipts of men, and to learne by all theſe blemiſhes forbidden, that the Iewes were then taught, (which wée haue alſo learned and beléeue) how no mortall man could be able to worke our peace and reconciliation with God, but onely Chriſt Ieſus. For in all men are ſome or other blemiſhes, and it became vs to 
                           Heb. 7. 2

                           haue ſuch an High-Priest as is holy, harmeleſſe, vndefiled, ſeperate from ſinners, and made higher then the Heauens, &amp;c. In him then there was no blemiſh but he was the imaculate Lambe of GOD, able to ſaue vs, willing to

ſaue vs with the beſt blood hée had, and he hath thus ſaued all thoſe that beléeue on him, and wée reiect all other Sauiours whatſoeuer. This was certainely the drift of this Lawe, and therefore wée may boldly gather this fruite from it.
                        
                           Laſtly, theſe perſons hauing ſuch blemiſhes, albeit they might not performe this dutie, to ſtand at the Aitar; yet were they allowed to eate of the ſacrifices and ſuch things as the Prieſts did eate of, and allowed to bée in the Congregation: ſo ſay ſome, ſhadowing that the Church although blemiſhed, neuertheleſſe is admitted to the communion and participation of thoſe things, which Chriſt by his eternall ſacrifice hath obtained for it. And my ſelfe would gather this comfort from it, that albeit ſome one or other infirmitie may iuſtly diſable mée for ſuch a place either in the Church or Common-wealth; yet from a place with the elect, either héere, or for euer, it ſhall not hinder mée: No, ten thouſand blemiſhes, nor any blemiſhes ſhall hinder mée, if gréeued with them, and fighting againſt them, as the Lord enableth mée, I take hold of my ſpotleſſe Sauiour,
                            as my helpe and ſafetie againſt them all. Thus then doe you meditate of this Chapter, and bee bettred by it, reading it ouer with theſe Notes, and praying in your heart for the helpe of his working ſpirit, to make the Word profitable vnto you. My labour is but to draw you to read by a taſte, and to pray that God may worke with you further then my Labours. The Word being a Well, the bottome whereof no man can come ſo vnto, but there will be ſtill more water to draw.

                        HAuing in the former Chap. noted what ſhould hinder from the Miniſterie, now it pleaſeth the LORD to note, what ſhould diſable them to eate of the holy things, mencioning againe ſuch vncleanneſſes in men, as before in other Chapters of this Booke were mentioned. If this queſtion ariſe in your minde, why God hauing before forbidden all men that had theſe pollutions to eate of holy things, ſhould not againe particularly forbid the Prieſts? anſwere is made, becauſe men in any authoritie and place are often apt to exempt them themſelues by one excuſe or other from ſuch obedience, as they are content others ſhould bée bound vnto. The Lord alſo threaneth puniſhment to the breakers of this Lawe, that feare may reſtraine, where loue will not.
                     2 The particular vncleanneſſes I will not goe ouer héere, but leaue you to looke backe to the 7. Chapter, the 13. and 15. Chapters, with ſuch like. Thus much doe you note again, &amp; let it be eueryours, that polluted ſinners remaining in their vncleanneſſe without remorſe and amendement, haue no right to the merits of Chriſt, but ſhall dye and periſh in their filthineſſe. Clenſed therefore we muſt be by newneſſe of life and Faith in Chriſt Ieſus, that we may be ſaued.

                        THIS Chapter entreateth of The ſumme of this Chapter. the holy Feaſtes and Dayes obſerued of the Iewes by GOD his appointment, either weekly, or yearely. Weekely, as the Sabboth, Yearely,
                         as the Feaſts of Easter, of Trumpets, of Tabernacles, of Penticoſt, &amp;c.
                         Of all which in Exod. 23. Numb. 28. &amp; 29. and Deut. 16.
                     1 Theſe feaſts, you may ſée, were in remembrance, for the moſt part, of ſome benefits and mercies of God, and therefore playnely teach vs, what a due dutie from vs to God it is, to remember carefully and thankfully his louing fauours ſhewed vnto vs at any time, vpon any occaſion. Thou ſhalt ſhew thy Sonne, ſayth God, in

                        that day, ſaying, this is done, becauſe of that which the Lord did vnto me when I came out of Aegypt. And it ſhall bee a ſigne vnto thee vpon thine hand, and for a remembrance betweene thine eyes, &amp;c. Likewiſe thoſe ſtones commanded to be ſet vp by Ioſua, they ſhall ſerue
                         (ſaith God) for a ſigne among you, that when your children

                         knowing this to bée a due dutie, cryeth to his ſoule to praiſe God and neuer to forget his benefites. 
                        Pſal. 103. 2. Pſal. 105. 5. And to others, to remember the marueilous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the iudgements of his mouth. A thankefull remembrance worketh loue, and deſire to pleaſe God, but other fruites come of forgetfulneſſe as you may ſée, Pſal 78. Verſe 7. 8 9. 10. 11. Beneficiorum dei memoria, Magiſtra advitam. The remembrance of Gods benefits is the Miſtres of good life,
                         ſayd Saint Chryſostome in his time. And Dona dei, bona non ſunt, niſi dei eſſe confiteamur. The gifts of God are not good, except wee acknowledge them to come from God, ſayd Saint Augustine.
                     
                     2 In that they were called the Feaſtes of the Lord,
                         
                        verſe 2. Men were taught in them to ſéeke and attend ſuch things as belonged to God, and not their owne matters, pleaſures &amp; ſports, &amp;c. To this end ſtill are Holy-dayes kept, and therefore thinke of the right vſe of them.
                     3 When hée ſaith, It is the Sabbath of the Lord in all
                         
                        verſe 3. 
                        your dwellings: Learne (ſaith S. Auguſtine) that no place priuiledgeth thée to breake Gods Lawe, but as being a ſinner whereſoeuer thou goeſt, thou carrieſt the yoke of ſinne, ſo being the ſernant of God, in all places obey his will &amp;c.
                     4 When they are called holy Conuocations, thinke verſe 4. in your conſcience, whether gadding, and riotting, and wanton dauncing, with ſuch like, be holy exerciſes and méete for a holy conuocation.
                     
                     5 For the Feaſt of the Sabbath,
                         in the Commandement it is handled, and thither I referre you. It had vſe to preſerue the Doctrine of Creation
                         againſt all idle Philoſophers dreames of an Eternitie. To confirme Faith
                        
in the Article, Maker of Heauen and earth,
                         and to refute all hereticall aſſertions touching the ſame. To be a refreſhing to the bodyes both of man and beaſt, which without reſt cannot indure. To giue time for men to ſerue God, who all the wéeke-long, and euer doth ſerue them. Finally to prefigure, and in ſome ſort to lay before vs, our aſſured eternall reſt in Heauen, when the Eſay 55. Hebr. 4. 
                        ſixe dayes of this life ſhall end, and that ioyfull ſeuenth day ſhall come.
                     6 The Feaſt of the Paſſeouer
                         or Eaſter you know was Verſe 5. kéept in remembrance of their diliuerance out of Aegypt. And it was a Figure to foretell them their deliuerance from ſinne by the death of the true Lambe, &amp;c. Sée Exod. Chap. 12. and 13.
                     7 The Offering of a ſheafe with the Ceremonies 
                        Verſe 10. &amp;c. 
                        mentioned taught them to acknowledge that the bleſſing of New corne euery yeare, commeth neither from the fertilitie of the ground, nor the labour and induſtry of man, but from the Lord. Secondly, this Feaſt hauing his time aſſigned, they could not enter vpon their harueſt before it was full readie, which by this time it would bée, vnleſſe they would either reape before they offered this firſt ſheafe, or offer it before the day appoynted. And ſo, you ſée, it had an vſe to reſtraine ill huſbands, and to make them more carefull, that old corne might be gouerned to bring in new. A gracious God that will ſo care for ſinfull man. Thirdly, it ſerued to direct them to the time of Pentecoſt, for from this day they reckoned ſeauen Sabbaths, &amp;c. as you read verſe. 
                        verſe 15. 15. Laſtly, béeing but one ſheafe, it might ſtrike their hearts with a fit féeling of his goodneſſe, that giueth ſo much, and taketh ſo little, that giueth without meaſure and taketh by meaſure, yea by a very ſmall meaſure: So let it ſtill profit vs to this day, for euen now alſo wereceyne much, and giue little, would wée giue that thankefully and cherefully, what a comſort would

God take in it? Though he néed none of our goods, only ſéeking to exerciſe our obedience and loue.
                     8 And they might not eat till they had brought an offering 
                        Rom. 11.

                        vnto God. ver. 14. Then God was firſt, but now is laſt with vs, yet as good to vs, as euer to them, and we as déepely bound to him for infinite mercies. Will not our ſinfull hearts in making God laſt, and giuing him the worſt, one day condemne vs?
                     9 Till they haue brought, are the wordes, ver. 14. and note them, they then brought, to ſhew their willingnes; we will bring none, but thinke we deale wel, if our miniſter may haue it for fetching, &amp;c.
                     
                     10 The feaſt of Pentecoſt, ſometimes called the feaſt of Weekes, was a remembrance of the Law giuen, and ſo of their receyued libertie by Gods out-ſtretched arme, hauing now a law, and gouernment of their owne, when before they were ſubiects and ſeruants to the Egyptians, and their lawes. So ſtill you ſée theſe holy daies, were to remember mercies, &amp; to giue thankes. Againe, this feaſt figuratiuely fore-tolde them, there ſhould come a Pentecoſt, when the firſt fruits of the ſpirit ſhould be giuen to men, fulfilled when Chriſt ſent the holy Ghoſt vpon his Diſciples aſſembled at Ieruſalem 
                        Acts. 2. at the feaſt of Pentecoſt.
                     
                     11 The feaſt of Trumpets, here alſo appointed had verſe 24. many vſes, as firſt in the opinion of ſome Hebrue Doctors, for a remembrance of the deliuerance of yong Iſaac from being ſa

Thirdly, for a remembrance (ſaith one) of the pardoning of that grieuous Idolatrie committed by erecting and worſhipping the golden calfe, which is thought was about this time. Exod. 32. 4. 
                        Fourthly, for a remembrance that this Moneth was once the firſt Moneth. Fiftly, that they might learne

                        holy aſſemblies to bee appointed by the voyce of God. And if they then when they heard theſe Trumpets blow, might thinke God called for them to the meeting: why ſhould not we now hauing our Bels for their Trumpets, thinke God calleth for vs to the Church and aſſemblie of the faithfull, when we heare them ring in our eares? Surely I know a feeling heart doth, and thereupon cannot bee quiet without going. Sixtly, that they might learne their duties to be through their whole life to follow God, when and whither ſo euer he ſhould cal. Laſtly, (as our marginall note ſaith) to put them in remembrance of the many feaſts in this Moneth, being the fitteſt time in déed after all fruits and bleſſings gotten in, to meete and praiſe God for them; praying alſo for grace ſoberly and orderly to vſe them to his glory, and their owne comfort, with all theirs whom God would haue alſo cared for, children, feruants, poore, &amp;c. I forget to tell you, that one ſaith this feaſt alſo was a figure ſhewing how Chriſt by the preaching of the Goſpel, as by a loud Trumpet ſhould be ſpred oner the world, and our ſaluation by him. In regard whereof Iohn was called the voice of a crier, and the Prophet biddeth other Mat. 3. 3. Eſay 58. 1. criers, lift vp their voyces like Trumpets, &amp;c.
                     
                     12 In the 27 verſe, the feaſt of Reconciliation is mentioned, Verſe. 27. of which more fully before in the xvi. Chapter.
                     
                     13 Of the feaſt of Tabernacles, ver. 34. the vſe was verſe 34. to remember them of their eſtate, when they had no houſes, but liued in Tents, or Tabernacles, or Boothes made with laughes; no fields, nor lands, but liued in the wildernes, and ſo to ſtirre vp a thankfulnes for their happie change. Secondly, to remēber them of the Lords great workes in driuing out the Cananites, and giuing that fruitfull land vnto them: Then they were a pray to all men, but now a terror to all men, whereſoeuer the ſame of them came. Thirdly, it ſerued to preach vnto them the doctrine afterward deliuered by the Apoſtle,
                        
to wit, that here we haue no abiding citie, but ſhould reckon of our houſes, as but of Tabernacles for the time, our true hope being for houſes and dwellings, and euerlaſting Tabernacles not made with hands in heauen, &amp;c. And may not wee conſider on our feaſt dayes all theſe things, although we haue not now the ſame ceremonies? May not we remember our ſtate paſt vnder ſuperſtition, crueltie, and bondage? May not we remember burnings and killings, and moſt hateful handlings of bloudic Butchers and perſecutors? May not we remember great warres and diſſentions in this our natiue Countrie, the fall of our friends, and the change of many houſes? May not we remember great impoſitions and payments, and in one word, verie many miſeries and calamities? Laying them to the preſent times, wherein we enioy truth, and libertie of conſcience without either death or danger, or ſo much as any feare: what a change is this to a man or woman, that knoweth and feeleth the bleſſing? O that we may ſend vp to God moſt thankful thoughts for it while we liue! Now againe we entoy peace: ſuch as no Nation hath had the like. We are not eaten vp with heauy and continuall payments, but we liue as in heauen, by compariſon to former times. The Lord hath driuen away the Cananites that would haue inuaded &amp; cōquered, had not he reſiſted for vs, and ouerthrowne them. He hath made vs a terror to our foes, 
                           •
                        a refuge or ſanctuarie for our friends, when earſt forreigne nations were Lords ouervs. And for the laſt point, we haue no more certaintie of abode here thē they had, but looke for the ſame end of faith, an induring houſe in heanē.

                        IN this Chapter the firſt thing ſpoken of, are the Lights vſed in the Tabernacle, 
                        Verſe. 2. whereof mencion was made alſo before in the 17. Chapter. Theſe lights were not ordeined for our imitation now vnder the Goſpel, but in thoſe times of ſhadows and figures they ſignified, that while they were thus vſed the true light was not yet come, by which all true beléeuers ſhould be deliuered from the darkneſſe of death, as Saint Paul ſpeaketh of the Tabernacle, Heb. 9. Papiſts lights then vſed ſtill in their Churches and Maſſing places, are euident ſignes that themſelues ſee not the true light, and as much as lyeth in them they thus confirme that Iewiſh expectance of the true light Chriſt, as if yet hée were not come. I know they haue their excuſes or reaſons for euerie thing, but who is able to abide moſt of them? As in this particular, why vſe they lights? Forſooth, in repreſentation of the Trinitie, the wax repreſenting the Father, the weeke the Sonne, and the light the holy Ghoſt. This boldneſſe is fearefull, and ſinfull, hauing neither warrant, fitneſſe, nor reuerence. Away with theſe lights therfore, and imbrace we the true light, who lightneth all that come into the world, &amp;c.

                        Ver. 4. is the man that hath charge of theſe lights, and God his Miniſters ſtill are the Miniſters of light, and haue the charge of it in the houſe of God. Happie they, if they be

carefull of it, to their beſt abilitie, that they may one day heare that ioyfull voyce, Come, come, thou good and

                     3 The next thing ſpoken of, is the Shew-bread, ſpoken Verſe 5. &amp;c. of alſo before. It likewiſe repreſented, that as yet the true bread from heauen was not come. That it is God, vpon whom the eyes of all things wait, and that openeth 
                        Pſa. 145 15. 16 
                        his hand, feeding both man and all his creatures with his bleſſings. That God ſo loued the Iewes, as hee had them continually at his table with him: yea euery Tribe
                         particularly he loued, there being 12. Cakes, for euerie Tribe one, &amp;c. More you may ſee, Chap. 25.
                     4 The third thing touched in this Chapter, is the matter of blaſphemie, verſ. 10. wherin your words are theſe. And there went out among the children of Iſrael the ſon 
                        Verse 10. 
                        of an Iſraelitiſh woman, whoſe father was an Egyptian; and the ſonne of the Iſraelitiſh woman, and a man of Iſrael ſtroue together in the hoſt. So the Iſraelitiſh womans 
                        verſe 11. 
                        ſonne blaſphemed the name of God, and curſed, and they brought him vnto Moſes. And they put him in ward, till 
                        Verſe 12. 
                        he told them the mind of the Lord. Then the Lord ſpake vnto Moſes, ſaying, Bring the blaſphemer without the 
                        verſe 13. Verſe 14. Verſe 15. 
                        hoſt, and let all that heard him, put their hands vpon his head, and let all the Congregation ſtone him. And thou ſhalt ſpeake vnto the children of Iſrael, ſaying, Whoſoeuer curſeth his GOD, ſhall beare his ſinne. And hee 
                        Verſe 16. 
                        that blaſphemeth the name of the Lord, ſhall be put to death; aſwell the ſtranger, as he that is borne in the land; when he blaſphemeth the name of the Lord, let him be ſlaine. What this blaſpheming was, if you looke your marginall note, it ſaith, by ſwearing or deſpiting God. Interpreters mencion diuerſe opinions, and ſcanne both the Hebrew wordes, and the Greeke tranſlation of them, all which I omit, as ſtill mindfull for whom I lahour,

and I ioyne with him that ſaith, Ego hunc locum ſic intelligo, quod filius viri Egyptii male precatus ſit alteri in iurgio, vt fieri ſolet, &amp; exoptauerit ei exitium aut calamitatem, idque non ſimpliciter▪ ſed per nomen Dei. Non dixit tantum, exopto tibi malum ſed addidit ac diſerte nominanit Deum, aut nomen Domini, inquiens, Dominus det tibi malum, &amp; per dat te perpetuo. I vnderſtand this place thus, that the ſonne of the Egyptian father curſed the other in chiding as the maner is, wiſhing deſtruction or ſome calamitie, to him, and that not ſimplie, but by the name of God. For hee ſaid not onely, I wiſh thee euill, but added and plainly named God or the name of God, ſaying; the Lord giue ſome euill to thee, and vtterly deſtroy thee.
                         Our fearful &amp; damned phraſes are, Gods curſe light on thee: the plague of God take thee, &amp;c. Which kind of ſpeaking, is moſt grieuouſly to abuſe the name of God, and to prophane it, being not onely a breach of the ſecond Table, concerning the loue of our neighbour, but a breath alſo of the firſt Table, by taking his moſt holy name in vain. This grieuous offender therfore, is not winked at by thē that heard him, neither yet puniſhed by them that had no authoritie, out of a colour of zeale, but he is orderly, and by a right zeale carried to Moſes the magiſtrate, and his offence opened there. Moſes againe (although ſuch a man) yet will do nothing haſ
                           •
                        ily in iudgement, and eſpecially touching life, but he will be aduiſed by God, who then ſpake from betwixt the Cherubims, Exod. 25. and Num. 7. And in the meane time committeth him to ward. The Lord anſwereth him, and commandeth that he ſhall be ſlaine, giuing a law alſo in general, that who ſoeuer ſo offendeth ſhall die, the whole congregation ſtoning him, and the witneſſes putting their handes vpon his head.
                         By which Ceremonie, the Lord made the witneſſes carefull what they ſaid. For it taught them, that if they bare falſe witneſſe, then were they guiltie of the bloud 
                           •
                        f him ſo ſhed by their teſtimonie: but if they ſpake truly,

then as he that offred a ſacrifice by laying his hand vpon the head of it, and caſt his ſinnes vpon the beaſt: ſo they by that ceremonie, laid his bloud vpon his owne head, and they remained cleare and blameleſſe. Yea the whole Congregation by ſuch execution of iuſtice, as by a ſacrifice, is clenſed and profited. So that when Phineas had ſlaine the wicked perſon, it is ſaid, hee turned 
                        Num. 25.

                        Dei, the Sacrifice of the Lord. For further vſe of it, you may thinke with your ſelfe, how the father of this offender was a ſtraunger, an Egyptian, and yet God would not ſpare him: how much leſſe then his owne people, I meane now, a Chriſtian by father and mother, brought vp in his feare, baptized in his faith, a hearer of his word, a profeſſer of it, &amp;c. Secondly, this man was angrie, and in his anger hee committed this fault, yet God ſpareth him not, how then do we excuſe our offences by our anger, ſaying, it was in my wrath that I ſaid ſo, or did ſo. For firſt, that anger and furie, and deſire of reuenge is naught, then to vſe God in it, and to make him a partie, or an executioner of your rage, ſeeking and wiſhing that he may curſe and plague, where you will (hée being all iuſtice, all mercie, all goodneſſe, &amp;c.) O what an encreaſe of your ſinne is this? Euer therefore ſettle it and ſinke it in your heart, what it is thus to abuſe God, to abuſe Chriſt, his wounds, his paſſion, whereby we are ſa

                           ging, and ill wiſhing, to any man, and eſpecially to ſeeke of him to do euill, and to vſe his name to that end. Thirdly, when the Lord will haue the whole Congregation to ſtone him, hee taketh triall of the zeale of ALL, and teacheth ALL to concurre with the Magiſtrate in loue and liking of iuſtice, and in furthering of it ſo farre as belongeth to euerie mans place. Whereas

now a dayes, we haue ſuch factions, ſuch affections, ſuch corrupt humors in vs, out of which i

Fourthly, hee is carried out of the hoſt to be ſlaine, as a token of deteſtation of his ſinne, by which he was vnworthy, not onely to liue in the Congregation, but alſo to die in the ſame, he was vomited or ſpued out, that all others might ſee, and feare, Eſay. 14. read it.

For all theſe ſhall come into iudgement, and find wrath. If the law of man paſſe them. God will neuer paſſe them. The tongue wee haue was giuen to bleſſe, not to curſe.

If therefore a Iew hurt a ſtranger, looke what hée had done that ſhould he ſuffer, as well as the ſtranger ſhould if he had hurt the Iew. This indifferencie is a bleſſed vertue to be learned from our God. For ſurely, we are altogether affectionate, if God guide vs not. If other mens children, ſeruants, or friends hurt ours, fire and ſword for them; but if ours hurt them, no ſuch matter, al muſt be boulſtred out, or bought out, or borne out, and iuſtice may not be done.

Finally, God is pleaſed with it, and you are graced by it your ſelfe, it getting you loue and all good report farre and neare, among as many as are to be cared for. Thus much of this Chapter.

                        The ſumme of this Chapter. verſe 4. 
                        Dayes, now will this Chapter ſpeake of the obſeruation of Yeares,
                         Namely, euery ſeauenth yeare, and euery fiftieth yeare. Firſt, of the firſt, and then of the Second. Euery ſeauenth yeare was the Sabbath of the earth, or the Reſt of the Land, becauſe that yeare they might neither plowe, nor ſow, nor dreſſe their Vines, but take what did growe of it ſelfe, and that muſt be common to all. For ſo is the firſt verſe to bée vnderſtood. That which groweth of it owne accord 
                        Verſe 5. 
                        of thy harueſt, thou ſhalt not reape, &amp;c. That is, to thy priuate vſe and for thy ſelfe alone thou ſhalt not reape it, or gather it, but with others &amp; among others, they with thée, and thou with them, the fruites of that yeare ſo ſpringing ſhall be common. True therefore we may ſay it is of the land alſo and earth, That which lacketh 
                        Quod caret alterna requie durabile non eſt. 
                        mutuall reſt, cannot indure. Whereupon among vs we haue an vſe, to let land reſt, ſome more, ſome leſſe, according as it is in ſtrength and goodneſſe. And that land that ſhould continually beare without want ſixe yeares, wée would ſay were good land. I remember the ſpeach of one out of a good féeling, to ſome wretched minded men that haue neuer inough. Quid das tu terrae pro tot meſſibus, mari pro tot piſcibus, caelo pro pluuia, ſtellis pro
                              •
                           uce, &amp;c. Si nihil das, inuides requiem? &amp;c. What giueſt thou the earth for ſo many haruests, the ſea for ſo many fiſhes, the heauens for rayne, the ſtarres for their light &amp;c. If thou giueſt nothing, doeſt thou enuie a reſt? &amp;c.
                         This therefore was a politicall cauſe of this Sabbath of the land
                         the ſeuenth yeare, that it might contynue and indure

fruitfull. Secondly, it had a Ceremoniall vſe, thus to put them in remembrance of that ſinne &amp; fall which caſt vs all out of Paradiſe, and brought men to labour, and the earth to néede labour: whereas if we had ſtood, the earth ſhould haue yéelded of it ſelfe fruites and profits, as in ſome glymſe they might ſée by the ſeauenth yeare. Againe, it ſhadowed out the true Sabbath and reſt in Heauen, where ſhall bée no labour and yet no lacke, but all comforts &amp; ioyes aboue the reach of our hearts now to féele or imagine. Read Eſay. 65. Behold, I create new heauens, and a new earth, &amp;c. Some-where alſo I haue read, that this reſt of the earth might rebuke the wicked crueltie of ſome Maſters, who haue no pittie of their ſeruants or cattell, but euer are labouring them, &amp; ſorry that their bodyes be not braſſe that they might neuer ceaſe, when as a gracious GOD
                         hath pittie vpon the very earth, and will haue that to haue a Sabbath and 
                           •

                     2 In this ſeauenth yeare, it was not lawfull to require their debts. For ſo you may read Deutro. 15. But ſome difference of opinions men haue touching this. Some ſay, their debt was cleane loſt, others ſay no, but for that yeare deferred and forborne, after demaunded lawfully and payd willingly, which is more likely, foraſmuch as theſe politicke Lawes of God were not ordained of God to ouer-throw Iuſtice, but to preſerue it, and direct it in a commendable and fit manner among men. Now it is Iuſtice to let euery man haue his owne. Then againe, the Hebrew Text in the place named Deutro. 15. is, Ab extremitate ſeptimi anni facies remiſſionem. Extremitas autem ſunt initium &amp; finis, From the extremitie of the ſeuenth yeare thou ſhalt make remiſſion. Now the extremitie is the beginning, &amp; the end;
                         betwixt theſe, it was not lawfull to aſke a debt, but before or after. Becauſe for that yeare there was no tillage to make money of, but after that returning to his vſe, the

right of the Creditor returned alſo, and the Lord graciouſly requited this forbearing, if hée did not with-draw his help becauſe the ſeauenth yeare approached. A right and true application of this, may euery féeling heart make in thoſe Cities and Townes within this Realme, where it hath pleaſed God to lay his ſore viſitation of Plague and infection, thereby ſtopping the Trade whereby euery man was inabled to get for his maintenance, and the diſcharge of ſuch debts as were due from him to others. God forbid but mercie ſhould bée found towards their brethren in thoſe, that looke for mercie at Gods hand to themſelues. When men cannot receiue, they cannot pay, and no diſhoneſt meaning giuing the ſtop, but onely the Lords hand ſtaying Trade, who will bée rigorous in ſuch a caſe, and ſay hée feareth God? when the earth reſted and there was no tillage to raiſe money by: You ſée the mercie of Gods Law here, and is it not all one when Trade ceaſeth? Let your bowels then ſhew whoſe childe you are. If the Image and ſuperſcription of God be vpon you, ſurely you will ſhew mercie, and giue ſome fit time to your debtor that meaneth truely. Reade-ouer, and often, I pray you, what God ſaith Eſay 58. Verſe 3. and ſo on: and remember hée is the ſame God ſtill.
                     3 There was then an other great Sabbath yeare beſides this ſeauenth yeare, Namely euery fiftie yeare, and it was called the Iubile, for ſaith your Chapter, Thou 
                        verſe 8. 
                        ſhalt number ſeuen Sabbaths of yeares vnto thee, euen ſeuen times, ſeuen yeare, and the ſpace of the ſeuen Sabbaths of years will bee vnto thee 49. yeares. Then thou ſhalt 
                        9. Iubilaeus a Iobel, quod ſignificat buccinam. 
                        cauſe to blow the Trumpet of the Iubile, &amp;c. Upon which blowing, it had his name of Iubile. The Ceremonies of this yeare were diuers and great: For it was a great yeare. Firſt, it was vnlawfull againe in this yeare, to till the ground, or to require debts, but a generall reſt and ceſſation was giuen this way, as in the

                        ſeauenth yeare you haue heard. Secondly, all Iſraelitiſh ſeruants in this yeare were frée, and Lands, the profits whereof were ſold, returned againe to the Tribe and Familie for preſeruing that Law. Numb. 36. Ne tranſferatur a tribu ad tribum, that it might not bee alienated from tribe to tribe,
                         leaſt ſo the tribes might haue béen confounded, and the truth not ſo certainly haue appeared, of what Tribe Chriſt came. This yeare of Iubile kept the diſtinction moſt ſure, and yet had they power to ſell from Iubile to Iubile as their neede required. Thirdly, this yeare was an excellent figure of that true Iubile and fréedome, which by Ieſus Chriſt the bodie of all ſhadowes ſhould by trumpet bée proclaymed to all that truely ſhould beléeue in him. And ſée the reſemblaunce. This Iewiſh Iubile was proclaymed by trumpet: ſo ſhould the Chriſtian freedome bée by the trumpet of preaching the Goſpell, which is the moſt notable trumpet. In this Iubile of the Iewes there were no debts demaunded and ſuch things as grewe of themſelues were common: ſo in the Chriſtian Iubile is fréedome proclaymed by CHRIST, Satan
                         hath no power to demaund what by ſinne wée owe him, to wit, either ſoule or bodie, and all the graces of CHRIST which growe of themſelues, that is, fréely are beſtowed vpon vs, and common in Chriſt to all, there béeing with him no reſpect of perſons, but all accepted that feare him and worke righteouſneſſe. Of this fréedome ſpeake the Scriptures comfortably euery where, As by the Prophet Eſay 61. The Spirit of the LORD is vpon mee, 
                        Eſay 61. 
                        &amp;c. He hath ſent me to preach good tydings to the poore, to binde vp the broken hearted, to preach libertie to the captiues, and to them that are bound, the opening of the priſon, to preach the acceptable yeare of the Lord, &amp; the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all that mourne. The Angel at his birth, Beholde, I bring you tydings

                        of great ioy that ſhall bee to all the people, that is, that

vnto you is borne this day in the Citie of Dauid,
                         a Sauiour 
                        Matth. 1. 
                        which is CHRIST. the LORD.
                         Why a Sauiour? An other Angell told the bleſſed Virgin,
                         becauſe hee ſhould ſaue his people from their ſinnes: This is the true fréedome and Chriſtian Iubile we ſpeake of. If the Sonne

                        make you free, you ſhall bee free in deed. Bee it knowen vnto you therefore (ſaith the Apoſtle) men and brethren, that through this Man is preached vnto you the forgiuenes of ſins, And from all things from which ye could not

                         places. Thirdly, in this Iewiſh Iubile there was a returning to their Lands and former poſſeſſions which were alienated from them: ſo by this Chriſtian Iubile, euen this fréedome proclaimed by Chriſt, we returne to our old Paradiſe againe, from whence we were caſt by ſin, that is, to the inheritance of the ſonnes of God in Heauen the true Paradiſe, from which wée ſhall neuer bée remooued any more. O ioyfull Iubile
                         then if wée féele it, that by the Trumpet of the Word is preached vnto vs in Christ! Hee that hath eares to heare, let him heare.
                        
                     
                     4 Beſides theſe two Iubiles thus inſtituted of God, you haue a third in theſe dayes inſtituted of the Pope, 
                        The Romiſh Iubile. to get vnto him from fooliſh people great ſummes of money. The firſt Authour whereof was Boniface the eight, who deuiſed to promiſe vnto all them that would come to Rome in the yeare 1300, and after that euery hundreth yeare, to ſéeke pardon for their ſinnes, a full remiſſion of all their ſinnes. After him, Clemens the 6. (who was made Pope in the yeare 1342) finding the ſwéete of this deuiſe, and thinking euery hundreth yeare too long, cut it of in the middeſt, and according to this Moſaicall Iubile made his Romiſh Iubile euery fiftieth yeare, promiſing like pardons and indulgences to all commers. After him, came Sixtus the fourth
                         in the yeare
                        
1473. and hée thought fiftie yeares too long alſo, and cut it of once againe in the middle appointing euery 25. yeare a Iubile. But ſée the deſire of money in theſe holy fathers. When this time alſo was too long to tarry for pardon-money, and they were aſhamed to shorten it againe: they deuiſe that certaine appointed perſons ſhould goe into all Countries, with pardons to ſell and offer to fooles that would buy them, by which pardons they ſhould receiue as full remiſſion of all ſinnes, as if they had come in the yeare of Iubile to Rome to fetch them. Which groſſe abuſe was the meanes (God ſo hauing appointed) to ſtirre vp Luther to preach againſt that abuſe, and ſo was drawen on to other points, till light brake out of darkeneſſe, &amp;c.
                     5 In the 20. Verſe, the Lord méeteth with an obiection 
                        Verſe. 20. 
                              〈◊〉
                           
                         of ſome men, that might happily ſay, what ſhall we eate the ſeuenth yeare, for wée ſhall not ſowe, nor gather in our increaſe, &amp;c? And moſt graciouſly and comfortably he anſwereth it. I will ſend my bleſſing vpon you in the ſixt yeare, and it ſhall bring foorth fruite for three yeares, &amp;c. The like ſwéet promiſe Verſe. 19. Sée then and ſinke it into your heart ſoundly, what God is able to doe for you touching all worldly neceſſaries, if you will obey him and truſt in him. Such a promiſe in Exodus 
                        Exod. 34. hée made alſo, to kéepe all things in ſafetie for them at home, while they were at Hioruſalem ſeruing him according to this Lawe. And what loſſe had the Shepheards when they left their flockes in the fieldes and went to the childe Ieſus,
                         according as the Angel had told them? Let this place againe ſtrengthen your faith, againſt all obiections of fleſh and blood made from naturall reaſons and cauſes as they ſééme to men. For if the Lord be able, euen then when the earth is weakeſt, hauing béen worne out with continuall tillage 5. yeares together, to make ye 6. yeare bring foorth a triple bleſſing, inough for that yeare, for the 7. yeare, and for the 8. yeare,
                        
till harueſt were readie; what vnſeaſonable weather, what barenneſſe of land, what this, what that, ſhall make a man diſpaire of Gods prouidence for things néedfull? Leaue God to himſelfe and to his Almightie power, doe you your dutie, feare him, loue him, ſerue him, obey him with a true heart, call vpon your children and ſeruants to doe the like, and you ſhall ſée the louing kindneſſe of the Lord to your comfort. Theſe things ſhall be caſt vpon you, and hée that knoweth your Matth. 6. 33. charge, and gaue you that charge, will neuer faile you nor them of what is fit. You ſée héere what hée can doe and let it profit you. I will tell you the féeling of my heart further in this point, and thus I reaſon; Can God bée thus ſtrong when the land is weake, and will he be thus ſtrong to the comfort of his ſeruants? Why then cannot he be, or why will he not bée ſtrong in my weaknes, in your weaknes, &amp; in euery man &amp; womans weakeneſſe that beleeue in him? Away feare, away, I may not hearken vnto thée, when I am weakeſt he wil be ſtrongeſt. For his power is beſt ſeene in weaknes, and 2. Cor. 12. 9. I will truſt in him, drawing an Argument with Dauid from my weakneſſe to mooue him, and not to diſcomfort me, Heale mee O Lord, for I am weake. My weakenes Pſal. 6. 2. ſhal driue me vnto thée, not from thée, &amp; I wil tarry thy good leaſure. Lord ſtrengthen me, Lord comfort me, and vnder the couering of thy wings let me be ſafe from al temptaions diſpleaſing thée, and hurting mée, Amen, Amen.

                        walled Citie, hee may buy it out againe within a whole yeare after it is ſolde, &amp;c. Firſt, this and ſuch other Lawes confirme our trading and dealing one with another by buyings and ſellings, aſſuring vs that ſuch contracts are lawfull, and with a good conſcience one man may vſe them with another. Secondly, we ſée and learne, that GOD doth not only know and regard the greater matters

of Kingdomes, and Princes affayres: but euen the meaner actions alſo of men, and the very ſmalleſt things are not hid from him. Therefore, doe iuſtly in all trading, knowing that God his eye is vpon thee, and then looke for a bleſſing, he ſhall not faile thée.

Firſt, by his gracious promiſe of bleſſing if they ſo did; and ſecondly, by a fearefull threatning of puniſhment if they did otherwiſe. His bleſſings which he promiſeth are theſe.

For as outward bleſſings befall the euill ſo out-ward croſſes befall the good, and diuerſe are the endes why God afflicteth his children, not euer for ſinne, nor in anger, But whom the Lord loueth he chaſtiſeth, &amp;c. Abel was ſlaine that the lot of the godly might bée noted in him. Iob ſore afflicted for the triall of his faith, and the Churches inſtruction. Ioſeph impriſoned and much wronged, that firſt he might be humbled, and then exalted. The blind man in the Goſpell, neither for his owne ſinnes nor his parents, but that Gods glorie might appeare.

                           they ſhall bee in the land of their enemies, I will not caſt them away, neither will I abhorre them to deſtroy them vtterly, nor to breake my Couenant with them, for I am the Lord their GOD. But I will remember for 
                           verſe 45. 
                           them the Couenant of olde, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt in the ſight of the Heathen, that I might be their God, I am the Lord, &amp;c. Some are of opinion, that theſe wordes were fulfilled in the captiuitie and deliueraunce out of Babylon. But the Iewes perſwade themſelues, that this promiſe of regard when they ſhould be in the land of their enemies, is not yet accompliſhed, but that they ſhall by vertue héereof, bée deliuered one day out of this eſtate they are now in, ſcattered and diſperſed into many places. The which conceipt of theirs, others thinke to be but an idle dreame, alledging that the Law and Prophets were

vnto Iohn, and that the Iewes ſhall neuer haue any more gouernment as they had. They applie therefore this promiſe to a true penitent ſinner, who ſhall euer bée reſpected vpon his conuerſion, albéeit hee neglected the time of grace offered. Yet this is no imboldning to preſume, but a comfort when repentance is true.
                        5 Wayes yet of God his deliuering penitent ſinners are diuerſe, and to bee obſerued that wee erre not. For ſome, vpon their ſorrow God not onely receyueth to mercie and fauour, but alſo deliuereth them out of their preſent affliction. So did hée Manaſſes the king, 2. Chron. 33. when béeing for his ſinne bound in yron and carryed away captiue, the Lord vpon his remorſe in thoſe yrons, not onely forgaue his ſinne, but releaſed thoſe bands, and brought him to his kingdome againe. Others hee receyueth vnto fauour, and forgiueth their ſinne, but yet ſuffereth them to fall by their outward affliction. So did hée to the penitent Theefe vpon the Croſſe, he receyueth him into Paradiſe, but ſaued him not from that temporall death. The due remembrance of this, is a great comfort agaynſt the loſſe of friends in warres, and plagues, and ſuch like calamities, when others eſcape and do well. Let vs therefore cleaue faſt vnto God, beléeue his mercie, feare his iuſtice. So whatſoeuer hapneth vnto vs, ſhall happen for our good one way or other.
                        6 In the 28. of Deutro. theſe bleſſings and curſings are repeated againe, moſt effectually to moue any heart that hath grace. Wherefore I often erhort all that deſire to liue godly, to read it often, that it may power-fully perſwade them to bée wiſe, and to take time while time ſerueth, to turne to the Lord, while his arme is ſtretched out to receiue them. For with the fooliſh Virgins to come to late, will bee woe without comfort, and deſtruction without helpe. Make no

tarrying, ſaith Eccleſiaſticus to turne vnto the Lord,

This (ſayth Saint Auguſtine) is fulfilled in many, but none vnderſtandeth, neither doth any man when he ſuffereth euill, perſwade himſelfe that his ſinne is puniſhed, but attributeth ſuch happes rather to cuſtome then to crime, &amp;c. This is a great blindneſſe, and therefore pray againſt it, and beware of it. This Chapter will euer aſſure vs, ſin will haue plagues firſt, or laſt, and therefore when they happen, complaine of ſinne, and not of God, remembring that true and good ſaying. Quae ratio eſt vt doleamus nos non audiri à Deo, cum ipſi non audiamus Deum? Et ſuſpiremus non reſpici à Deo terras, cum ipſi non reſpiciamus in coelum, &amp; moleſtum ſit deſpici à Deo praeces noſtras, cum praecepta eius deſpiciantur à nobis. What reaſon is there wee ſhould grieue that God will not heare vs, when wee our ſelues will not heare God? Or why ſigh we that God will not looke downe to the earth, when we our ſelues will not looke vp to heauen? We can deſpiſe his precepts, and yet he may not deſpiſe our prayers.
                            We beat our ſeruants if they offend vs, being but men as they are, and God may not beate vs for our faults, he being our Creator, and we but duſt. Thus make vſe of theſe curſes, and in ſtead of them, God euer vouchſafe vs, for his ſonnes ſake, his bleſſings.

                        This is the laſt Chapter of this Booke, and containeth two generall Heads.

                              
                                 The matter Of Vowes.

                           made to GOD willingly and aduiſedly in a matter lawfull and poſſible. In the Booke of Numbers, Chap. 30. You may ſée what Vowes were lawfull, and what not; here, how lawfull Vowes are to bée performed, or redeemed being of that ſort that might be redéemed. For of Vowes, ſome are commaunded of God and cannot bée redeemed, but muſt néeds be performed: ſuch a Vowe is the Vowe of Baptiſme, of Faith, and of newneſſe of life in the Lords Supper. Of which ſort of Vowes the Pſalme ſaith, Offer to GOD the ſacrifice of prayſe and pay thy Vowes to the moſt High. If thou Vowe, 
                           Pſal. 50. 
                           pay it, &amp;c. Eccleſ. 5. Some Vowes are ſimply vnlawfull, 
                           Eccle. 5. being either ſinnes when they are made, or not to bée performed without ſinne. Some are neither forbidden, nor commaunded, but indifferent. And in theſe we muſt take héede, that we make them not as any ſervices of God, or merite to our ſelues. For true it will euer bée, that, in vaine doe men worſhip GOD teaching 
                           Matth. 15.
                           
                           for doctrine mens precepts. In this Chapter obſerue ſundrie particulars of things named that might bée vowed to God.
                        
                        
                           Perſons.
                           Beastes.
                           Houſes.
                           Fields, &amp;c.
                        
                        Concerning Perſons, a man might then vowe either himſelfe, or ſuch as were ſubiect to his authoritie and power, vnto the ſeruice of God. Thus Anna vowed to GOD the Male-childe which God ſhould giue her, if hée in mercie would vouchſafe to giue her one, according to her great and earneſt deſire. And ſhée accordingly performed her vowe, when God graciouſly gaue her Samuel 
                           1. Sam. 1. 2
                                 •
                              . her ſonne. But in caſe a perſon thus vowed had a deſire to be frée againe, the Lord permitted that there might be a redemption made according to ſexe and age with money. And if the partie were ſo poore that ſuch a rate could not be performed, then was the Prieſt to nominate and appoint the quantitie or ſumme that ſhould bée payd. The proportions named in your Chapter héere are theſe.

                              Verſe 7. From 60. yeares vpward, a Male at 15. ſicles, a Female at 10.
                              Verſe 8. If any could not pay this, then the Prieſt rated as I ſayd.
                           
                           
                           Et hac redemptio fit, vt quae morte propria non expletur, ſaltem praetio vouentis deuotio compleatur. And this redemption is made (ſaith one) that the deuotion which was not made by death, at leaſt might be made by the commutation which the Vower ſhould giue.
                           
                        
                        2 The ſecond ſort of things that might bée vowed 
                           verſe 2. were beaſtes, Verſe 9. where you ſée if it were a Beaſt that lawfully might bée offered in ſacrifice, then was there no redemption allowed of it. But if it were any vncleane beaſt of which men doe not offer a Sacrifice vnto

                           the Lord, then it might be redeemed, and in caſe the partie would not redeeme it, the Prieſt might ſell it. If there were a redemption made, then was a fifth part more aboue the valuation to be giuen, becauſe it was a D

Here alſo lay a redemption, as you may ſée in the next verſe. The fourth ſort were fieldes, whereof ſome were by inheritance, 
                           Verſe 15. ſome by purchaſe. If the Field were inheritance, then was there one maner of redemption, Verſe 16. &amp;c. 
                           verſe 16. Verſe 22. if by purchaſe, then an other verſe 22. &amp;c.

Notwithſtanding the firſt borne of the beaſts becauſe it is the Lords firſt borne, none ſhal dedicate ſuch, bee it Bullocke or ſheepe, for it is the Lords, &amp;c. You know the firſt borne were the Lords by an other Law, and no redemption might be made of ſuch, but they muſt be left to the ſeruice of God, as they were appoynted either to bée offered in Sacrifice, or to be to the vſe of the Prieſts, &amp;c.
                        
                        5 There were of Vowes againe two kindes, one

ſimple, whereof you haue ſéene theſe perticulars, an other which had an execration or curſe ioyned to it, if the

                           thing vowed ſhould be changed from the vſe and end allotted, whereof now your Chapter ſpeaketh in the next Verſe 28. place, Verſe 28, and 29. Notwithſtanding, nothing ſeperate from the common vſe, that a man doth ſeperate vnto the Lord of all that he hath (whether it be man, or beaſt, or land of his inheritance) may be ſold nor redeemed: for euery thing ſeparate from the common vſe, is moſt holy vnto the Lord. Nothing ſeparate from the common

                           vſe, which ſhall be ſeperate from man, ſhall be redeemed, but dye the death. Where you muſt vnderſtand by ſeperate, ſuch a ſeperation or vow as is made with a curſe if it be altered. In which there was no redemption allowed, or ſale, or alienation any way. In this ſort, if men were vowed, they muſt dye and not be ſpared. But then not innocent men muſt be vowed, but Malefactors that by euill doing deſerued death. Such were the men of Iericho. Ioſua
                            6. and Achan, Ioſua
                            7. the Amelakites, 1. Sam. 15. and ſuch others, which made the ſinne of Saul and the people very great, when they ſpared Agag the King and the better ſheepe and Oxen, and the fatte beaſtes, and the Lambes, and all that was good &amp; would not deſtroy them. And héere hence ſprang that kinde of giuing things to the Church for the ſeruice of God, that you ſée in many old Charters in England, with a grieuous curſe vpon all thoſe that ſhould alter &amp; change thoſe things from that vſe, wherein they ſhewed their earneſt deſire to haue things continue as they were giuen.
                        6 Now, if you aſke why God ordayned theſe kinde of Vowes? the anſwere is, that he did it in two reſpects. Firſt, that his people might not follow the faſhion of the idolatrous heathens round about them, who had their faſhion of vowes wicked and ſinfull, but might be directed in a good ſort, ſéeing they would follow ſome ſort.

                           Secondly, that here-hence might ſpring ſome maynteinance for the Miniſter, whereof in all things, and by all meanes, hee ſhewed his gracious care.
                        7 They of the Romiſh Religion, as from theſe Rites and cuſtomes of the olde Teſtament, they haue borrowed many things; ſo haue they vowing, and many ſtrange Vo

                              es haue they in vſe and high regard. They haue alſo redemptions of their Vowes, namely Pardons, and diſpenſations, matters of no ſmall profit to them. But the Leuiticall Prieſt-hood béeing ended, and all theſe Ceremonies, Rites, Cuſtomes, and Lawes that were not Morall, by the comming of the Lord Ieſus the truth of all Figures and ſhadowes, and man hauing no power of his owne head, to erect and deuiſe any worſhip of GOD
                            without his warrant in his Word, eaſily may wée ſée and all men with vs, what ground their Vowes haue, and how pleaſing they are to GOD.

Virginitas carnis non ſeruatur mente corrupta: intactis corporibus, fugit castitas de moribus: Virginitie of the fleſh is not kept when the minde is corrupt: Though the bodie bee neuer touched, yet chaſtitie often flyeth from a man and womans manners.
                            With many ſuch like ſayings worthy noting.
                        8 Yet let vs knowe, that there are two ſorts
                           
of Vowes, Ciuill Vowes, and Religious Vowes. Ciuil 
                           An other diuiſion of Vowes.
                            
                           Vowes are ſuch as Men make to Men in honeſt, lawfull, and poſſible things, binding themſelues thereby to a performance of what they promiſe. And thoſe in honeſtie

                           aſed by him, or them, to whom they were made. Religious Vowes are ſuch as are made to performe thereby ſome worſhip to GOD,
                            and they are of two ſortes: either ſuch as are 
                              Ʋere Religioſa, Truely religious,
                            Or Speciem habent, or ſuch as haue a ſhewe of Religious Vowes. Truely Religious are they, that bynde to the performance of things commaunded, as that in Baptiſme named before, and in the other Sacrament of the LORDS Supper,
                            with ſuch like. In Prayer alſo and Thankſgiuing, vnto which vſually Vowes were annexed, in Prayer ſhewing their moſt earneſt deſire to obtaine their requeſts at Gods hand; and in thankſgiuing ſhewing their due féeling of his goodneſſe, and in regard thereof promiſing to doe this or that lawfull thing, when they ſhould come to the place where Sacrifices onely were to be offered all places as you know béeing not allowed, but the place which God did chooſe, from which many Iewes dwelled farre, &amp; came but at times. And as prayers were made in perill of ſickneſſe, of ſea, of warre, and ſuch like ſo were Vowes. Such as haue a ſhewe of Religious Vowes are thoſe that are deuiſed for the honouring of God; but haue no warrant from him, neither indéede are allowed of him. And theſe againe may be ſaid to bée of two ſorts. For ſometimes they are directly againſt and

As hath been ſayd, and they ſhadowed Chriſt the inheritance of the Leuites, and as yet of all Miniſters, and the comfort of all men that depend vpon him. The number of Ten, is a perfect number and abſolute, beſide which there is no other which is not conteyned in it: So is Chriſt the beginning and end of all. And they taught that a part being made holy by dedication to God, all the reſt ſhould bée holily vſed, and neither ſpent in ryot and ſinne, nor hoorded vp to make a dearth and famine to the deſtruction of the poore, &amp;c.
                        2 There are ſpirituall tythes, which the godly haue a care euer to giue vnto God, by referring all the gifts of body and minde which the Lord had beſtowed vpon them to the ſeruice and glory of his Name. Which tythes Pharaoh payd not, when hee ſaid, Who is the Lord, that I ſhould obey him or heare him. Neither Aſſhur when he boaſted of his ſtrength and power againſt God, whereof Eſay 10. Verſe 7, and ſo on, read it I pray you. Neither Nabuchadnezzar, Antiochus, and others that being wormes meate and duſt, yet inſulted ouer God and forgot themſelues.

What ſhould I adde? ſome men will ſcorne all admonition, yet all, neither doe nor will. So to fly a pitch here, as a man may both fly-vp, and pitch in heauen hereafter, is an happy thing, And I ſay no more.
                        Thus much ſhall ſuffice of this Booke called Leuiticus,

I humbly commend to him that made my heart and knoweth my heart. Hée hath bleſſed, and can bleſſe euery mans indeauours according to his gracious will and pleaſure. In which had I not reſted; too well I know theſe dayes and times what diſcouragements they yéeld many wayes, than in them to haue gone foreward any further, but to haue ſtaied with that which I began when things were better taken. Yet bleſſed bée GOD, hée hath his portion, and Wiſedome is iuſtified of her children. The Preacher, ſaith Saint Gregorie,
                            
                           In Ezech. Hom. 3. 
                           ſhould bee like the Smiths burning iron, which not onely heateth thoſe that are neare, but caſteth ſparkes farre of. The Sunne (ſaith an other) is content not onely to ſhine vnto vs preſent, but will do the like to thoſe that ſucceede when wee are gone: and ſo ſhould the Preacher doe. Et paucis natus eſt qui populum ſuae aetatis tantummodo cogitat: And hee is borne but for a fewe, that onely thinketh of the people preſent when hee liueth,
                            ſayth wiſe Seneca. Homo naſcitur reipub: A man is borne for the

                           Cōmon-wealth ſaith the Ciuill Law, and not for the time onely wherein hee loueth. For non minoris curae eſt mihi qualis post mortem meam Reſpub: fuerit, quam qualis bodiè: My care is no leſſe for the time to come after mee, then for the preſent,
                            could Tullie ſay. Ano Ariſtotle, Bonum vniuerſale diuinius eſt. The good that is generall is

more excellent.
                            All which ſayings, I truſt no man will deny may as rightly be applyed to the Miniſter of God, and his Church. Let no man therefore accept with the left hand what is giuen with the right. We haue all a Iudge, and he is righteous. We muſt giue an account one day both how we haue laboured, and encouraged or diſcouraged others to labour. Our abilities are not alike, but the God of mercie accepteth faithfulneſſe in the meaneſt. The hearbe that is good is not reiected in the vſe it ſerueth for, becauſe the Gardiner that planted it was inferiour to many Gardiners more excellent. I will ſay no more, but with eyes and heart caſt to him that onely giueth encreaſe whoſoeuer planteth or watereth, beſéeth him for his Sonnes ſake, to make theſe my poore endeauors profitable, as I wiſh them to his Church.
