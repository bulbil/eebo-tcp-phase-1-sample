            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               THIS is to admoniſhe the
gentle reader that if before
this time thou haſte not red
this boke, and commeſt ther
vnto as an ignorant perſon
that thou beware of geuing
any credite or faith vnto any
of the blaſphemous lies and Miracles conteined
herin, whiche are not poſſible to be true
they are ſo directly againe the mooſt precious
&amp; holy word of god. And firſt thou ſhalt vnderſtād
yt there is a boke in latin entitled &amp; named
Liber Couform
                     •
                  tatum. That is to ſay the boke
of the rules of the barefote Friers, conteining
a wagō or cartful of fables and blaſphemous
doctrines againſte Chriſt &amp; true religiō, out of
the whiche theſe few thinges herafter mencioned
in this treatiſe is excerpted &amp; gathered.
            
               
                  •
               nd euen at the firſt in ye praier that ye Friers
make to Frances, thou maieſt ſe how horrible
idolatry they commit in attributing to Frances
that onely aperteineth to chriſte, whiche is
the remiſſion of ſinnes and the rewarde of euerlaſting
lif. They apply alſo al the Figures
of the old Teſtament to aperteine to Frances
&amp; ſo they ſhadow and hide Chriſt, and auance
Frances farre aboue chriſt. Of this it foloweth
that Chriſt is but a Figure of Frances
(as the Turk thinketh) &amp; that figured Frāces
is al in all, whereof ſpringeth this hereſy that
Frances is the very true Meſſias, mediatour
aduocate &amp; patrone yt they cal vpō, and of him
thei aſk euerlaſting life. who hath hard greter
blaſphemy, ād what is this but ye falſifieng &amp;

denieng of the ſcriptures of god ſpokē of his
ſonne Ieſu chriſt, which ſaith Ihon. x. I geue
them euerlaſting life. Whatſoeuer ye aſk the
father in my name he wil geue it you, i Ihō. ii
We haue an aduocate with the father whiche
is Ieſus chriſt the iuſt. &amp;c. i. Ti. ii. There is
but one mediator betwene god and man euen
Ieſu chriſt. &amp;c. Wherfore chriſtiā reader whē
thou haſt wel conſidered theſe thinges, weigh
them as earneſt matters, and god graunt that
we may ſo weigh them in hart and mind that
we may deteſt and abhorre ſuche abhominacions
and to cleaue faſt to Chriſt. Amen.
            YET here reſteth to be told what ſhould
moue me now at this time (Friers beyng baniſhed
from hence and their wicked doynges
and doctrines worthely condempned) to publiſhe
and imprint this treatiſe: certainly two
thinges, firſt for that it was firſt gathered ād
ſet furth in highe Dutche by. D. M. Luther &amp;
after by an other great lerned man tranſlated
out of dutche into latin, &amp; likewiſe imprinted
and ſet fourth after that Friers were baniſhed
in Germany. And the ſame cauſe that I
thinke moued them, doth now likewiſe cauſe
me to imprint theſame, which is this, after ye
light &amp; knowlege of gods holy word had, ther
is litle perrel to bring furth falſe &amp; erronious
doctrines, for that ſo ſone as they come vnto
ye light therof they are eſpied &amp; iudged, like
as in the darke though a manne be very well
furniſhed of weapons hable to defend himſelf

from his enemie, yet for lack of light he loſeth
the right vſe of them, for that hee may miſſe
his enemy and hurt his frend, &amp; hauing lighte
and his weapons alſo, hee defendeth himſelf, &amp;
ſaueth his frend and vanquiſheth his enemy.
So now that God hathe geuē vs the light of
the knowledge of his mooſte holy and ſacred
woord, &amp; hath indued vs with the weapons &amp;
armor of hys holy ſpirite, wee nede not feare
the Deuel our enemye nor his doctrines, but
may boldly loke vpon him in the day light and
ouercome &amp; confound him and al his: &amp; this as
a ſpecial &amp; principal thing ſhal we herby haue
great cauſe to reioyſe and praiſe god for, in yt
of his great merci he hath deliuered vs from ye
blindnes &amp; bondage of thoſe papiſtical Caterpillers,
&amp; that we may now laugh to ſcorn ſuch
foliſh and filthy doctrine, as in the time of ignorance
we beleued and worſhiped for truth.
            An other cauſe is this, that I ſe a great nū
               bre
which rather delite in lies &amp; vanities, and
therwith to pas their time, then with the liuely
&amp; moſt fuitful worde of God And for ſuch: I
thought this a mete boke, that by the lies her
in conteined they may confound &amp; condempne
their awne ignorance whych at thys Daye by
lies is and hath ben eſtabliſhed, ād that therby
they may be ocaſioned to deſier further knolege
and come to the light of gods mooſt holy
word which euery chriſten man ought
moſt ioyfully and gladly
to embrace

               And to tel the what I am, lothe I am god wot
               But what I am in dede now ſhalt thou know
               This I am I tell the, the truth for to ſhowe
            
            
               I am the rule of the barefote Friers,
               Which learne of me, to be ſhameleſſe liers
               For al that is in me, of lies are grounded.
               Therefore in England I am confounded.
            
            
               I am ſuche a boke, plainly the to tel
               As of Friers is beleued before the Goſpell,
               And al ſuche hipocrites as Friers are in dede
               Beleue me better then they do their crede.
            
            
               I am old, and came not in of late,
               I am no newe doctrine wherof diuerſe prate,
               I was firſt writen with S. Frances hand,
               And confirmed by ye pope for euermore to ſtād
            
            
               I am that boke, which plainly doth expres
               Not onely the rule of bleſſed Sainct Frances
               But alſo the miracles of a numbre of Friers,
               With blaſphemous tales, both ſūdry &amp; diuers.

then perceauing that the laſt day

               The name of Frances is diuulged

               The bowelles of Charite were

               When S. Frances deſired of
Chriſt a great Pardon for the
ſynnes of the people, Chriſt bade
him aſke what he woulde and yt
ſhould be graunted to him, for
he was ordeyned to be the light
of the Gentyles.

               Maſtres Picha, the mother of
bleſſed. S Frances was conceaued
with him after the maner of
another Elizabeth, and ſhe dyd
not only reioyſe as Elizabeth
dyd, but alſo ſhe named him Ihō
at his baptiſme. If S. Frances
were like to ye ſonne of Mary our

Lorde Ieſu Chriſt, then of force
he muſt be as good as Ihō baptiſt
And certeynly he was more
thē Ihon baptiſt, for Ihon baptiſt
was but a preacher of penaunce,
but Frances bothe preached
yt and dyd inſtitute yt. Alſo
Ihon baptiſt was the forrunner
of Chriſt by preachyng, but
S. Frances was bothe his preacher
and banner bearer, wherin
he exceded Ihon. Alſo Frances
is before Ihon for he conuerted
more then Ihon dyd, and hath
trauayled in mo places, that is to
ſaye thorow out all the worlde.
Ihon preached but ij. yeres and
a lytle more, Frances preached
xliij. yeares. Ihon receaued his
aucthorite but of the Lorde: But
Frances receaued yt both of the
Lorde and of the Pope, whiche

is more. Ihon what maner of
perſon he ſhould be was declared
of an Angell to his father,
and by the holy ghoſt was made
knowen to the Prophetes. But
Frances was declared by the
Prophetes, by our Lorde Ieſu
Chriſt, and by an Angell in the
likenes of a pilgrim, both to his
Father and Mother and whole
houſhold. S. Ihon prophecied
bothe in his Mothers belye and
abroade. Bleſſed Frances propheſied
in ye belye, that is to ſaye
in priſon beyng takē at peruſe, of
his deliueraunce. S. Ihon was
ye frende of ye ſpouſe, but Frances
was made like vnto Chriſt him
ſelfe. Ihon to the worlde was
very holy: But Frances excelled
in holynes, and therefore befor
all other Chriſt prynted in

him the marke of his woundes.
S. Ihon is exalted into the order
of the Seraphins, But S.
Frances is exalted into theſame
order and is ſet in ye higheſt ſeate
where Lucifer dyd ſyt.
               But was there any other that
were glad of ye birth of S. Frances?
Ye truly. Who were they?
forſoth that were Enoch and Helias,
whiche appered vnto a certeyn
freer of the order of Benedict
of ye partyes beyond ye ſeas,
and they aſked him, what order
arte thou of? He aunſwered of
Frāces order. And they ſayd then
Frances cōmeth, and they made
great reioiſyng, and led theſame
Freer wt theim throughout all
paradiſe ſhewyng him all thīges.
And yt is no meruayle that they
ſo reioyſed in Frances, for like

alwayes ioyeth in their like. Alſo
the ſoules in purgatory reioyſed
at his birth, &amp; ſpecially all thoſe
whiche were of ye iij. orders, for
they were deliuered from their

Alſo the dead reioyſed, for

               Fances beyng in prayer, the
Deuell ſayd vnto him, Frances.
Frances, Frances? Frances
aunſwered and aſked him what
he would,This ſaiyng, if y
                        •
                      wer ſayd, was not the Deuelles ſaiyng. he beyng in ſubieccion
ſayd, There is no ſynner in the

worlde which if he conuert, that
nedeth to fight with him ſelf: but
ſurely whoſoeuer by hard penaunce
kylleth him ſelfe, ſhall
neuer fynde mercy.
            
            
               Theſame leafe.
               Frances and his felowe
as they went into Apulia found
a great purſſe wyth mony, he
knowyng that the Deuell had
done yt for a bayte, at the inſtance
of his companyon that yt
might be geuen to the poore, he
tooke the purſſe, and he no ſoner
touched yt but the Deuell iſſued
therout in the lykenes of a Serpent
&amp; caried the purſſe with him.
               Another brother goyng by the
way found a penny and tooke yt
vp and put yt in his mouth to
geue yt to the poore, and ſtreight
waye his tonge and membres

were made lame and dombe by
the Deuell, But when he had
ſpyt out the peny and done penaunce,
he was reſtored, both to
his ſpeche and other membres.
            
            
               Theſame leafe.
               Frances often tymes dyd ſe
the Deuell, not only in a diſſimuled
maner, but to feare and greue
him he ſhewed him ſelf playnly
and clerely in his awne forme
and faſſion. Freer Giles aſked
of S. Frances if the Deuell were
ſo terrible that a man might not
behold him a pater noſter while?
S. Frauces aunſwered, that no
man was hable to behold the deuell
half a Pater noſter while,
but he ſhould dye immediatly.

                  nto Frances
ſaiyng, knoweſt thou not that

ſlepe is a great noriſſhyng to the

pulled of his cote &amp; his breeches
and goyng out of his Cell ranne
naked into the wildernes, when
yt was froſt and ſnowe, and all
to tare his fleſh with the thornes
of the wood.
            
            
               Theſame leafe.
               S. Frances beyng occupyed
in prayer vpon the mount of Aluerne,
the Deuell would haue
throwen him doune headlyng,
by reaſon the ſtones wheron he
kneled were loſe &amp; holowe: but
Frāces caught one of ye loſe ſtones
in his hand as he was fallyng
&amp; theſame cloue as faſt to ye reſt

wherby Frances ſtayed himſelfe

               S. Frantes hearyng in the
Goſpell that the diſciples ſhould
cary no mony in their Purſſes,
neither ſhould they Haue ij.

the holy Ghooſt, ſtreyt way he
caſt away his Shoes, and his
ſtaffe, and put on an olde threde
bare cote made after the maner

And thus the life and rule of bleſſed

would put nothyng in them, but
ſuffred theim to blede, for the loue

The Deuelles excedyngly feared
this Freer Iunyper, for he
goyng by a certeyn toune the deuell
fled vii. myle from him, and
beyng aſked why he dyd ſo? He
aunſwered, that he could not abyde
the pacyence of that fooliſhe
Freer Iuniper. Wherefore S.
Frances, when the Deuelles
would not at his cōmaundment
depart out of men, he would ſaye
to the deuell, except thou departe
the ſoner, I will cauſe Freer Iunyper
to come to the, and then the
Deuell fearyng the preſence of
Freer Iunyper, and the vertue
and holines of Sainct Frances
departed.
            
            
               Theſame leafe.
               S. Frances perceauyng the
great holynes of Freer Iunyper,
ſayd vnto his brethren, I would

to God I had a whole wood of
ſuche Iunyper.
            
            
               Theſame leafe.
               Freer Innyper kept ſylence
vj. dayes after this maner. The
fyrſt daye in the honour of the
father, The ſecond in the honour
of the ſonne, The third in the honour
of the holy ghoſt, the fourth
in the honour of the bleſſed virgyn
Mary, and ſo he obſerued
ſylēce euery day in the reuerence
&amp; honour of one ſaint or another.
            
            
               Theſame leafe.
               Freer Iunyper had a certeyn
brother to his diſciple, which was
ſo paciēt▪ that if he had bene ſkorged
all the daye long, he woulde
ſaye nothyng. And when Freer
Iuniper dyd byd him wepe, then
he would wepe, &amp; when he bade
him laugh, then would he laugh,

When Freer Iunyper heard of
his death, he ſayde, I haue no
more goodes in this worlde, and
he brake all the veſſelles in the
Houſe, ſaiynge, that the whole
world by his death was deſtroyed.
And that if yt ſhould not be
horrible to his brethrē, he would
cauſe the hed of his diſciple to be
deuyded in ii. peces, the one part
to be made a dyſhe for theim to
eate their meate in, &amp; of theother
part a cup for theim to drynk in.
            
            
               Theſame leafe.
               Freer Iunyper ſayd, I would
after my death that ther might
iſſue ſuch ſtenche out of my body
that no man ſhould be hable to
come nygh yt,This is a ſaynt in dede. and that finally
they would throwe me into a
dyche that ther I might remayne
abhominably alone for dogges

to deuoure. This bleſſed man,
when death came woulde haue
Sainct Clare with him.
            
            
               Theſame leafe.
               Freer Andrew of Anany. at a
certeyn tyme had a luſt to eate of
lytle byrdes roſted, and when
they were made ready and ſet before
him, he would not conſent to
his luſt, but makyng the ſigne of
the croſſe on the byrdes, he commaunded
theim to depart, which
ymediatly reuiued &amp; flew away.
            
            
               Theſame lefe.
               Freer Ambroſe of Maſſa, if he
fortuned to offend any perſon by
a worde, he would take a corde
and tye yt about his neck and
mekely aſke forgeuenes, and in
the moſt diligēteſt maner would
waſhe the dyſhes. He reyſed
vj. from death to life, and he deliuered

one from the daunger of
a wolfe.
            
            
               Theſame leafe.
               Freer Morice ware next his
body a Habergeon and lyued
with rawe herbes. He woulde
eate no fleſhe vpon Chriſtmas

ſayd Saynt Frances to him, I
woulde that the very Walles
ſhould eate fleſhe that daye if yt
were poſſible.
            
            
               The lxiiii. leafe
               Brother Reignold beſought
Chriſt that he would declare vnto
him into what order he ſhould

And our lord Ieſu Chriſt aunſwered,
that he ſhould go into the
order of the Barefoote fryers.
            
            
               Theſame leafe.
               Freer Benedict of Aret, receaued

Fryers the Emperoure of
Conſtantinople, and kyng of

               ¶Thefore ſayde Fryer, had
a great deuocion to Sainct Danyell,
whoſe Sepulcher is in
Babilon, and dragons kepe yt,
whiche Sepulcher he deſired
greatly to ſe, but what for the
length of the iorney and for feare
of the dragons he coulde not
come at yt. Then appered vnto
him a honge and great dragon
and caught him vp in his tayle,
and caryed him to Daniels Sepulchre,
the Sepulchre beyng
opened, he gat a fynger of S.
Daniel, which with great deuocion
he brought with him. And
forth with he was of the ſame dragon

taken vp &amp; ſet ther agayn
from whence he came. Wherfor
yt is to be beleued that yt was
the Angell of the Lorde.
               Theſame man alſo, as another
Ionas in a tempeſt was throwen
into the Sea, and ſtreight waye
he was taken vp in a lytle cloude
&amp; caryed into paradyſe. Whome
when Enoch and Ely ſawe, they
aſked him who he was, and he
Aunſwered I am a Freer of
Saynct Frances Order, then
they made great ioye, and led
him aboute ſhewynge him all
thynges that were in Paradiſe,
and then afterward he was
brought agayne of theſame lytle
cloude to the Sea, whom when
the men ſawe, they excedyngly
wondered.
               Teſame man healed a woman

that had a fiſtula on all her

               Theſame leafe.
               Freer Wylliam of Radcofe,
enteryng into a certeyn hermytage
kneled doune and prayed,
the deuell lykewiſe kneled doune
hard by him and ſtroke him on
the cheke, whiche when he had
ſuffred a good while, at the
laſte the Freer put out his hand
thynkyng to haue caught the
Deuell at his next ſtroke. But
the Deuell fleyng, ſo ſtroke
&amp; hurte Freer Wylliams hand
that ther roſe v. great Blyſters
whiche ſwelled very muche and
were ſo greuous that a greate
tyme after he was not hable to
do any thynge wyth that hande,
            
            
               Theſame leafe.
               Ihon of Aluerne, when he was

an infant, euery Monday, Wedneſday
and Frydaye would ſuck
but once, And woulde eate nothyng
elles. And in his meditacion
of Chriſtes paſſiō he would ſo
beate him ſelfe, that what with
teares and blood yt ſemed that
ther ranne Ryuers of blood out
of his body. And he dyd vſe
to hang nettels about his neck
and body to ponyſhe him ſelfe
withal. And when a certeyn
perſon ſayde, then ſhall he be a
good Barefoot Fryer, hearyng
that worde, beyng inſpired of
the LORDE He entred
into that Order, and he kept the
veſtry and ſong in the Queer.
In the tyme of great froſt and
Snowe he went naked, ſauyng
that he ware a payer of breches,
ſometyme he ware a habergeon,

and ſome tyme a cote of ſwynes
leder, and ſome tyme a cote of
Horſe heare knotty, and he ware
next his fleſhe a hoope of yron.
By the ſpace of xxx. yeares he
drank water. In Lent he
dyd eate euery daye no other
thyng then aſmany rawe herbes
as he could holde betwene his
ij. fyngers. In iii. yeares he neuer
ſate, neither ſlepyng nor wakyng,
except yt were at the table,
in the chapiter houſe, or in the
Queer. God daylye came to him
by the ſpace of iij. monethes and
gaue him the vnderſtandyng of
all ſcripture. ¶In
the citie of Florence he preached
in the myddeſt of the ſtrete
on a fayre day, but within a lytle
whyle yt reyned, but yt neither
touched him, the pulpit nor the

audience, to the great wonder
and meruayle of the people. He
was viſited of all the Sayntes,
and our bleſſed Lady ſtoode by
him a whole daye in theſame
forme and maner as ſhe was
here vpon the earthe. Saynt
Frances with his woūdes appered
vnto him and ſtoode a great
while by him and ſayd, Aſke
of me what peticion ſoeuer thou
wylt, and I will graunte yt
the. Then he deſyred that he
myght touche and kyſſe his
woundes, whiche S. Frances
graunted him, and he was woū
                  derfully
comforted. Alſo as he
was ſyngyng on S. Lawrence
daye of his broylyng, ſodeynly
ſaynct Laurence appered vnto
him as he was broylyng and behelde
him with a pitifull looke.

And when he ſong Salue Regina
he appered agayne ſaiyng, that
gredyron is my great comfort.
Once as he was ſaiyng Maſſe
he deſyred to ſe Chriſt in theſame
maner and forme that he was
crucified in: Then appered
Chriſt beholdyng him with his
eyes of compaſſion. ¶On a
tyme he beyng in the wyldernes
beſought Chriſt that he woulde
appere vnto him. Then appered
Chriſt vnto him iii. or iiij.
tymes ſhewyng him his backe
but ſayd nothyng: But ye good
brother ſeaſed not wepyng vntill
ſuche tyme as Chriſt turned
his face to him and ſtretched
out his handes as the Prieſt
doth when he is at Maſſe. Then
he fell doune at the fete of Chriſt,
whiche he put foorth for him to

kiſſe, whiche he waſſhed with the
teares of his eies, like an other
Mary Magdalene, and at the
laſt Chiſt offered him his handes
to kiſſe. And Freer Ihon riſing
came to the breſt of Chriſte, and
embraced him, and Chriſte kiſſed
him, but after yt he preached moſt
profound diuinitie, his hart burned
an .C. times more, then if it
had bene in a burning Fornace,
and for extreme heat he was forced
to crie out and make exclamations.
He was once rapte of
God aboue al creatures, and his
ſoule was ſwalowed vp in the
depenes of diuinitie, and was buried
in the Sea of infinite knowlege
of the godhed, inſomuch that
nothing created, nothing made,
nor imagined, nothing thoughte,

nor comprehended, whiche either
hart could think, or tonge coulde
ſpeake, but it was knowen and
reueled vnto him, ſo that his ſoul
was ouerwhelmed, as is a drop
of wine in the ſea, and he ſaw nothing,
but god in all thinges and
aboue all thinges, and without
al thinges, and there he ſawe iii.
perſones in one godhed. &amp;c and
thus beyng in his meditacion, &amp;
in wailing and weping he came
to the euerlaſting glory.
            
            
               Theſame lefe
               Theſame Frier receiued once
within the Octauas of the Aſſūption
of our Lady, ſuch a ſwetnes
and confort, that becauſe he wold
not be harde of his bretherne he
went into a woode to powre out
the greate ioyes that was in his

hart and as he cried out for gret
greate ioy hee thoughte vpon the
wordes of conſecration, Hoc eſt
corpus meum. And immediatly
he ſawe in a great Light Chriſte
with the bleſſed Virgin his mother,
and being repleniſhed with
Wonderfull Ioye he returned
and went to Maſſe, and when he
had ſaid the preface, and Qui pridie.
and came to the wordes of cō
                  ſecration,
often times he ſaid Hoc
eſt, Hoc eſt, but he was not able to
expreſſe any more. Wherefore
the Wardeyne of the Frires,
and another of his Bretherne
began to helpe him, but he ſodeinly
ſayeng Corpus meum. imediatly
apered to him our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſte ſhewinge him his
greate humilitie, whiche offred

him ſelf to be incarnate, and cauſeth
himſelf daily to come into ye
handes of the prieſt. When he beheld
the preſence of the Lorde, his
hart melted as waxe, and fel back
warde, but he was ſtaied of the
Wardeine and his bretherne, and
as one dead, they caried him into
the Veſtry, and his body was as
cold as Yſe, and ſo he laye as one
departed from the morninge vntill
it was none, ſo that he coulde
not make an end of Maſſe
               Theſe thinges, did he declare
vnto a certain brother in whome
he put greate confidence.
               ¶At another time as he was miniſtring
at Maſſe Chriſte apered
to him with a goodly fayre
Bearde, clothed in a precious
Red Garmente and he was

certified that god was ſo pleaſed
for that maſſe ye he wold remit ye
ſinnes of all the world, but ſpecially
thoſe which were recommendedO moſt deteſtable blaſphemy.

Loke &amp; thou ſhalt ſe bleſſed

Chriſt lifted vp hys right arme,
and out of the wound of his ſide
came fourthe Frier Frances bearing

And immediatly the citizen,

bleſſed Frances turned his face

the voyce of Chriſt aunſweryng
in the ayre, Frances, there is nothyng
in thy rule that is thyne,
but all that is there, is myne, and
I wyll that the rule be obſerued
to the letter, to the letter, to the

proue that our rule is inſtituted

Wherfore he compareth his rule

with the law of Moſes that was

the law (as they call yt) of the
goſpell that was publiſſhed by

               The rule of the Minorites or

in the ende of the tytle is this added.
This is the holy Goſpell
of our Lorde Ieſu Chriſt which
we promes to obſerue and kepe.
There is no rule that begynneth

as ye may perceaue, for ther
is none ſo Goſpell lyke as is this
bleſſed rule, Alſo this rule is
the life of the Apoſtles, and conſequently
of oure Lorde Ieſu
Chriſt, for as he had xij. Apoſtles,
ſo hathe this rule xij. chapiters,

               Frances ſayd vnto Chriſt,
wherof lyue my brethren whiche
dwell in the wyldernes? Chriſt
ſayd vnto him, I will fede theim
as I dyd fede the Children of
Iſraell in wyldernes.
            
            
               Theſame leafe.
               Frances beyng vexed with
the offences of his brethren, ſayd
vnto Chriſt. Lorde I recommend
vnto the my famely which
thou gaueſt me. And forth with
the Lorde ſayd vnto him, thou
noddy and ydeot, tell me, wherfor
doſt thou thus vexe thy ſelfe whē
any brother doth go out of religion?
Aunſwer me, who planted
and ordeyned this religion,

was yt not of my plantyng? I

vnto theim, ye the workes whiche
I worke in the, they may alſo
worke in the. If one forſake
thyne order, I wyll ſend the another,
if he be not borne I wyll
cauſe him to be borne, and put
the cace that there remayned but
iij. brethren, yet ſhould yt be my
religion, which I wyll neuer forſake.
Whiche wordes when
Saynct Frances heard, he was
excedyngly comforted.

               Guncer a Monke of Barrauia,

I wyll not take the for I am

thou ſhalt be ſaued. By the
whiche reuelacion he was made
a Barefoote Freer.

               A certeyn perſon was very
deſyrous to ſerue God, &amp; Chriſt
beyng glad to here the prayers

in a barefoot Freers cote ſaiyng,
he that wyll ſerue me, muſt ſerue
me in this maner, &amp; ſo he vanyſhed
away. But he neuer ſawe any
barefoote Freer, and therfore he
made him ſelf a Monk, howbeyt
on a tyme when he eſpyed ii. barfoote
Freers goyng by the way,
forthwith he forſooke that religion
and becam a Barefoot Freer.

               A certeyn Freer ſayd vnto

he ſayd, this night I was caryed

Freer Giles criyng for

I beleue the well, I beleue the

               A naughty Freer beyng dead

Deuelles caryed him into hell.
This viſion was ſene of a certeyn

               A certeyn Freer ſawe this viſion.
All the ſayntes paſſyng by

that he was purged in purgatory.
And beyng aſked wherfore,
he aunſwered, becauſe I coulde

And you ſhall vnderſtande that

               Another Freer, becauſe he dyd

He was ſet vpon a highe piller,

he ſayde that theſame bowyng

Like as Adam not obeiyng

So S. Frances obeiyng and

fullfillyng the commaundementes

               S. Frances on a tyme beyng

bleſſed Lady with a great company
of Angelles are in ye church
lookyng for the &amp;c. Who commyng

ſayde Chriſt vnto him, Frances
thou and thy Brethren are wonderfull
carefull for the ſoules of
faythfull people, therefor aſke
what thou wylt for their comfort
&amp; yt ſhalbe graunted the, for thou
art ordeyned to be the light of the
gentiles. And he laye as one rapt
into the godhead, and at the laſt
commyng to him ſelfe he ſayde,
Our father moſt holyeſt I wretched
ſynner beſeche the, foraſmuche
as yt pleaſeth the to owe
ſuch fauour to mankynde, that
thou wilt graunt indulgence and
remiſſion of all and ſynguler the

moſt humbly beſeche our Lady &amp;
thy Bleſſed Mother the ſpeciall
aduocatryce for mankynde, that

ſomuche as ſhe may to helpe me
in this my peticion and to make
interceſſion vnto thy mooſt deuoute
and excellēt maieſtie. And
our bleſſed Lady with moſt heauenly
humylite forthwith inclined
to the prayers and peticiō of
bleſſed Frances, and ymediatly
made ſuplicacion to her Sonne
ſaiyng, Moſt high and almighty
God, I moſt humbly beſeche thy
godhead that ſomuch as thy maieſtie

Frances. And the diuine
maieſtie of God ſpake ſaiyng, It
is very greate that thou haſt deſyred
but thou arte worthy brother
S. Frances to haue greater,
and thou ſhalt haue greater, and
I do admyt and graunt thy peticion.
But I wyll haue the to go

geuen power to bynde &amp; loſe &amp;c.
And aſke of him on my behalfe
this indulgence and Pardon.
               Twelue of S. Frances brethrē
beyng in their Celles heard
all theſe thynges, but beyng
ſtricken with feare they durſt not
enter into the church. And anone
Chriſt with a great multitude of
Angelles departed into Heauen.
In the mornyng S. Frances cō
                  maunded
his brethren that they
ſhould ſpeake nothyng of theſe
thynges. Then went he vnto
Pope Honorius and declared
vnto him this viſion, and he obteyned
the graunt of this pardon
and ſo departed. When Frances
was departyng, ye Pope ſayd, O
Symple perſon whether goeſt
thou? What caryeſt thou with

the for a teſtimony of this pardō.
Then bleſſed Frances aunſwered,
thy word is ynough and ſufficient
for me, if yt be the worke
of God, he can manifeſt and declare
his awne worke, and I deſyre
none other inſtrument but
only that our Lady be the paper,
and Chriſt the notary, and all the
Angelles witneſſes. And in his
iourney he tolde Freer Maſſey
his felow the viſiō, and ſayd, brother
Maſſey I ſay to the on goddes
behalfe that the pardō which
is graunted to me of the Pope is
confirmed in heauen. The Cardinalles
hearyng of this graunt,
reproued &amp; rebuked the Pope for
grauntyng to Frances ſo greate
pardon ſaiyng, thou wylt bryng
the indulgence of bleſſed Peter &amp;
Paul to nothing. The lord Pope

aunſwered we haue geuen and
graunted it to him, yt is not expedyēt
to deſtroye that is made.
But foraſmuch as Frances neither
of God nor yet of the Pope
had appoynted any determynate
day whē this pardon ſhould begī,
he was again wōderfully troubled
&amp; prayed that he myght ſe
ye viſion once agayn, and that he
myght be certefyed of Chriſt.
Wherfore on a tyme in the moneth
of Iāuarij about mydnight
when Bleſſed Frances was in
prayer, the deuell came vnto him
&amp; ſayde, Frances why wylt thou
dye before thy tyme? why doeſt yu
occupye thy ſelfe on this faſſion?
knoweſt thou not that ſlepe
is more meter for the? Thou art
yong and ſlepe ſhalbe thy health,
and I haue often tolde the how

thou ſhouldeſt otherwiſe do thy
penaunce for ſynnes, and not ſo
ſtreight and ſore as thou doeſt
To what purpoſe doeſt thou bete
thy ſelf thus? And bleſſed Frances
ymedyatly put of all his clothes
and his breches and ſtriped
him ſelf ſtark naked, and he went
out of his Cel &amp; paſſed thorough
a great rough hedge and entred
into a great wyldernes whiche
was very thorny, ſo yt his body
was all bloody: then ſayd he to
him ſelf, yt is a great deale better
that I ſhould thus knowlege ye
paſſion of our Lord Ieſu Chriſt,
then obeye vnto deceitfull flatterynges.
And ſodeynly there
was in the wyldernes a great
light, which appered to be wōderous
full of gelyfloures and Roſes.
&amp; there was an innumerable

cōpany of Angelles whiche ſayd
with one voyce, Bleſſed Frances
come hether quyckly, The Sauyour
and his Mother are in the
Church and tary for the. Then
bleſſed Frances ſawe him ſelfe
newly appareled, but howe or
which waye yt came to paſſe he
could not tell. And there appered
vnto him a waye couered all
with ſylke, by the which he wēt to
the Church. And bleſſed Frances
tooke out of the roſary, xij. red
roſes and xij. whyte, and he came
foorth with to the Churche, and
vpon the altare there he layd the
roſes. Then he ſawe our Lorde
Ieſu Chriſt ſtandyng, and oure
bleſſed Lady his Mother on his
right hand with a great multitude
of Angelles. And bleſſed Frā
                  ces
ſpake ſaiyng: Our moſt holyeſt

Father whiche art the orderer
and gouernour of heauen &amp;
earth, I beſeche the of thy great
mercy that thou wilt voucheſafe
to ordeyn and appoynt the daye
that the pardon whiche thou haſt
graunted ſhall take effect &amp; that
thy bleſſed Mother the aduocatryce
of mankynd will aſſiſt herunto.
To whome Chriſt aunſwered,
I will that yt be theſame
daye in the whiche bleſſed Peter
was deliuered from his bondes,
begynnyng at the firſt euenſong
of theſame day and contynue
to the euenſong the next daye
folowyng, includyng the nyght,
and that whoſoeuer cōmeth thether
that day contryre &amp; confeſſed
ſhalbe pardoned and forgeuen
of all ye ſynnes that he hath done
from the daye of his baptiſme to

the day of his entraunce into the
Churche of our Lady Porcyuncule,
how greuous or great ſo euer
their ſynnes be. And bleſſed
Frances ſayde, Mooſt holyeſt
Father, how may this be knowen
to mankynde that they may beleue?
And our Lorde ſayde, that
ſhall God proſpere and help thorough
his Fauoure and Grace.
Notwithſtandyng thou ſhalt go
vnto Rome to my Vyker whome
I haue ordeyned and appoynted
&amp; to whome I haue geuen power
to bynde and loſe, &amp; wyll him to
publiſhe &amp; declare this pardon
wt aſmuche expediciō as he ſhall
thynk mete. Then ſayde bleſſed
Frances, but how ſhall thy Vyker
credyt me, paraduenture he
wyll not beleue me wretched ſynner.
The Lorde ſayd to him, bleſſed

Frances, take with the certeyn
of thy brethrē for wytneſſes
thewhich hear all theſe thynges,
&amp; alſo take with the theſe red and
whyte roſes which yu gathered eſt
in the moneth of Ianuarij when
thou waſt poniſhing of thy body
in the wyldernes. All theſe
thynges were hearde by Freer
Peter of Cathany, Angell of
Reato, Ruffine Sophy, Freer
Maſſey, &amp;c. Then bleſſed ſaynct
Frances tooke of the roſes that
he brought iij. red and iij. whyte,
in the honoure of the moſt holy
and indiuiſible trinite, and to the
praiſe of god &amp; our bleſſed Lady.
And then the Angelles ſong with
lowd and great voyce, Te deum.
               
               In the mornyng bleſſed Frances
tooke his felowes, ſaiyng to
theim, let vs go to Rome, and he

commaunded theim to kepe all
theſe thynges ſecret. And
when he entred into Rome, he
tooke his way toward ye Church
of Saynct Iohn Lateranence,
and there he found Pope Honorius
the ſucceſſor of Innocent,
and the Viker of oure Lorde Ieſu
Chriſt. To whome S. Frances
on the behalf of our Lord declared
all the thynges aforſayde,
&amp; of theſame bare wytnes theforſayd
brethrē and the roſes aboue
mencioned. And Pope Honorius
beholdyng in the moneth of
Ianuarij roſes ſo freſhe, and
hauyng ſo quyck a ſauour and
colour, ſayd, this is ſuerly a great
myracle, and muſt come rather
of God then of man, &amp; we knowe
that their teſtimony is true. Then
the Pope cōmaunded that Frances

and his felowes ſhould haue
wherwith to refreſhe theim ſelues.
The next daye after, bleſſed
Frances came agayn to the pope
ſaiyng: Moſt worthy Vyker of
Chriſt, fullfill about the matter
aforſayd, the wyll of the kynge
of heauen and his Mother. And
beyng aſked agayne in the preſence
of the Cardinalles what he
deſyred. And when he aunſwered
the forſayd pardō to be at Lammas
or the day that ſaynt Peter
was loſed out of his bōdes. The
Pope aunſwered, Frances, that
which thou deſireſt is very great,
but foraſmuche as the kynge of
heauē at the inſtaunce of the moſt
bleſſed Virgyn his Mother hath
heard thy peticion, we will wryte
to the Byſſhopes of Aſſiſio, Peruſino,
Tuderino, Spolitano,

Fulginati, Nucerino and Eugubino,
that they ſhall aſſemble
together at the Churche of Portiuncule
the firſt day of Auguſt,
and there they ſhall declare the
pardon in ſuch wiſe as thou ſhalt
deſyre to haue yt. And ſo bleſſed
Frances and his felowes receauing
ye Popes letters &amp; departed.
And bleſſed Frances ſayde vnto
the Byſſhopes, which of you will
publiſhe and declare this pardō.
When the Biſſhopes were all aſſembled
at the daye appoynted,
bleſſed Frances ſayd vnto theim,
yf yt pleaſe you, though I be vnworthy
I wyll ſaye ſomewhat in
the preſence of this people and
declare vnto theim the pardon
graunted by the commaundmēt
of the kyng of heauen, obteyned
at the inſtance of the bleſſed Virgyn

and Mother of Chriſt, and
you are cōmaunded by the Pope
to affirm theſame with me. Then
bleſſed Frances preached ſo ſwetely
and ſo comfortably, that he
ſemed rather to haue bene an
Angeil then a mortall mā. Then
he declared the pardon that yt auayled
from the Euenſong the
firſt day of Auguſt vntill the Euenſong
on the ſecond day of the
ſame moneth aſwell by nyght as
by daye, yerely for euer. The
Byſſhopes hearyng bleſſed Frā
                  ces
ſaye for euer, they were angry
&amp; muche offended, ſaiyng to
Frances, The Pope hath not cō
                  maunded
vs herin to folowe thy
mynde, for his pleaſoure is but
for x. yere. And therfore euery
Biſſhop by him ſelf declared vnto
the people that they muſt vnderſtand

the wordes of Frances
of this pardon to indure for x.
yeres and no lenger.
               Here I omyt muche folyſhnes
whiche I am wery to wryte.
            
            
               The C.lxix. leafe
               Bleſſed Frances ſayd, after vs
ſhall come Freers that wyll buyld
theim greate houſes,A true prophet. wherin
noble men ſhall inhabite &amp;c. But
Frances would haue his houſe
made of none other then clay and
wykers.
            
            
               The C.lxxv. leafe.
               Freer Maſſey purpoſyug to
trye the humilite and mekenes of
bleſſed Frances, ſayde vnto him,
what art thou? what art thou?
what art thou? what art thou?
Bleſſed Frāces aunſwered, what
meaneſt thou, and Freer Maſſey
ſayd, for all the world ſemeth to

ronne after the, and all deſyer to
ſe, heare and obey the. Thou art
no fayre man Thou haſt neither
great cōning nor wiſdom. Thou
art no noble man. How commeth
yt then that all the worlde dothe
thus folow the? Bleſſed Frances
hearyng this, reioyſyng wonderfully
in ſpirite, and holdyng vp
his face to heauen, ſtood ſtyll a
great ſpace his mynde beyng directed
to God, and commyng to
him ſelfe agayne, he made lowe
curteſey &amp; with a feruent ſpirite
gaue prayſes &amp; thankes to God,
and turned him ſelfe to Freer
Maſſey &amp; ſayd, wilt thou know
what I am? wylt thou knowe
what I am? and wylt thou well
vnderſtand what I am, and why
all the worlde foloweth me? God
hathe ordeyned the fooles of this

world to confound the wyſe, and
I am a wretched ſynner. Then
Freer Maſſey knewe that bleſſed
Frances was grounded in
very humilitee.
            
            
               The L. lxxvi. leafe.
               Bleſſed Frances ſayd vnto his
Brethren, that they ſhould not
Iudge any thynge to be impoſſible
that was cōmaunded theim
in their rule: For if he had commaunded
theim to do thynges
aboue their ſtrength, yet holy obedyence
neuer lacked ſtrength.
Once a certeyn Freer dyſobeiyng
his gouernour, he cōmaunded
him to put of all his clothes
&amp; his very breches &amp; ſo to ſtand
naked before him, which the Freer
dyd. Then he commaunded
him to dyg a graue or a pyt,
which alſo he dyd. Then he cō
                  maunded

him to go into ye graue,
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      odly 
                        〈…〉

                     heir Brethrē quyck.
and ſo he dyd. And bleſſed Frances
couered him with earth euen
vp to the hard beard, and ſayde
vnto him, Art thou not dead?
Brother, art thou not dead? And
he aunſwered he was dead. Then
ſayde bleſſed Frances, aryſe, if
thou be dead in dede thou muſt
obey thy gouernoure at a beck,
and grudge at nothyng.
            
            
               The ſame leafe.
               Two yong men beſought S.
Frances to admyt theim into the
order: but he myndyng to proue
firſt their obedyence, led theim
into a garden ſaiyng vnto theim,
come, let vs ſet coles or colewortes,
and as ye ſe me ſet theim, ſo
looke that you do. Then bleſſed
Frances ſet the rotes vpward &amp;
the leaues douneward. One of

theim dyd in all thinges lyke vnto
bleſſed Frances,
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      rea

                        •
                      Freers. but the other
dyd not ſo, but ſayde to bleſſed
Frances, the coles ſhould not be
ſo let, but rather contrary, that
is to ſaye the rotes dounewarde,
and the leaues vpwarde. To
whome bleſſed Frances, ſayd, my
Sonne, I wyll that thou do as
I do: whē he would not do ſo becauſe
yt ſemed folyſhnes to him,
bleſſed Frances ſayde vnto him,
Brother I ſe that thou art the
chefeſt maſter, go thy wayes for
thou art not mete for
my order.
            
            ¶Here an end, for I wyll
