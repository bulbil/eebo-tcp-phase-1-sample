            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

TRANSLATOR
to the Reader.
                  
                     Christian Reader,
                  
                  
                     THere fell lately into my hands, a
Latine Copy, of the ensuing Parallell
drawne, (as I am giuen to
vnderstand) by two English Diuines,
at the request, and for the
satisfaction of a forraigne Minister
of State: At the first view I
laid it aside, as an euidence whereof
I conceiued the truthes aduocates,
especially in this Kingdome, had no present vse.
But afterwards reuiewing it more fully, and finding it very
particular and punctuall in this kinde: and, that on the
by, it gaue much light to the Disquisition of some points
now in agitation. I thought fit to translate it, for more
publique vse. For as Zanchius complaineth with much regret
of the Lutheran Vbiquitaries, that he found them vbi

                        ,
euery where to vex and molest him: So it is to be feared,
that the error of the Vniuersalists is too vniuersally dispread.
Many men haue too much free-will, and take to themselues
too free liberty now a dayes to aduance and maintaine
free will. I would to God more had the power of
grace to contend for speciall and sauing grace, and resolutely
to defend her Supremacie aboue corrupt Nature.
The errors touching these points, of no lesse consequence
then difference, are here briefly set in view in a two leafed

Tablet, representing on the one side the olde, and on the
other the new Pelagianisme varnished ouer with a faire
glosse by the pensil of Arminius, and his Schollers. The
occasion of drawing this Tablet, as I finde in the Latine
Preface, was this. Acacius Baron of Dona residing some
moneths in England, to sollicite the recouery of the Palatinate,
was often set vpon, and much laid at by a stranger
there named Roerghest, a man deepely engaged in the Arminian
party, who, though he could not draw him from the
trueth to that side, yet he cast such mists of doubts before
him, that his Lordship for better clearing, desired the conference
of some English Diuines, versed in controuersie of
this Nature. And opportunely meeting with two at
once, after kinde and respectiue salutation, he demaunded
of them why the Diuines of England so generally distasted
the doctrine broached by Arminius. Their answere was,
That albeit those tenets were plausible to corrupt reason,
and set out to 
                        〈◊〉
                      best aduantage, by the wit and Art of
the patrons thereof 
                        〈◊〉
                      the sacred Scripture (to which
Naturall reason must bow 
                        〈◊〉
                      strike sayle) throughly
searched, and impartially scanned, gaue no support at all
to this new modell of Gods counsels framed in mans brain,
And that the prime Fathers of most eminent note in the
Church aboue 1

                     00. yeares agoe, at the first birth of those
mishapen Brats,

                     shed them against the stones, and consequently
that by the same Orthodoxe ancient Church, the
new reuiuers of those er
                        ••
                     rs at this day were then before
hand condemned in lumbis parentum, in the loynes of their
parents, the whole and halfe Pelagians. The Baron somewhat
affected with this answer, as it should seeme, taking
it indignly that Roerghest should offer thus to delude him
with false shewes.
                  What say you, quoth he? The Doctrine so much strouen
for, and so highly extolled by some, is it nothing but olde
heresie new furbished ouer? Certèsi Arminius Pelagium
refodit, meritò vos Arminium defoditis. Verily if it be so,

as you affirme, that Arminius diggeth Pelagius out of his
graue, you haue all reason to bury Arminius deepe, that
he rise not againe. It was not long that this Honourable
personage, was againe encountred by this sollicitor Roerghest,
and further vrged vpon his former motiues.
Whereupon the Baron acquainted him with the English
Diuines answer, which like strong Physick wrought presently
with his queasie stomack, and brought forth from
him the Catalogue ensuing, with a challenge, Quid tandem
Arminio cum Pelagio? What kindred or neighbourhood
hath Arminius with Pelagius, or with the Demipelagians?
This Catalogue being then sent from him, and
receiued by those two Diuines, they iudged not complete
enough to set out the bounds of the question; but thought
needfull thereunto to take in more ground out of the larger
fields of those Fathers that entred into the lists of
this combat. Accordingly partly out of that Catalogue,
and partly out of the auncient Fathers, they make vp a
kinde of list of the olde errors: and as for the new, they
take them out of the Treatises of some principall Belgique
Writers of that side: which, collected into a small map,
they exhibite to the Baron to be deliuered to the confident
chalenger. Who vpon the receipt thereof, vndertooke to
returne forthwith a direct and punctuall answer. But
this Dutch Champion quitting the field, tooke Sea, and
returned into Holland, casting his promise to the same
windes, that filled his sayles. So is his forthwith drawne
forth now diuers yeares, and his answer in vaine expected.
                  So deuine and admirable is the course of grace, that it
reacheth an helping hand euen to those who through error
ioyne hands and pennes against it, and enlightens the
vnderstandings euen of those that cast mysts to dimme the
light thereof. There may therefore bee hope, that as
Pighius endeuouring to euert Caluins writings in point of
Iustification, was in that point conuerted himselfe by

them: so this Challenger considering of this answer, though
with intent to refute the same, was himselfe confuted by
it, and rectified in his iudgement. For in this

                     n that looketh
not through a Iesuites spectacle, may (though in small
modell) behold the true shape and temper of Pelagius his
frenzie in Arminius his fancie, and resolue, as St. Ierome
did, in a like case, Aut Plato Philonizat, aut Philo Platonizat,
Either the Pelagian predestination was ex praenisa
fide Arminij, out of the foreseene faith of Arminius, or
Arminius his deuise out of the fore-read faith of Pelagius.
                  
                  If any, after hee hath viewed this table, cast a scorne
vpon it, as composed by some gloating Puritane, and condemne
Criminis inauditi, of a new found crime, namely
of doctrinall Puritanisme all those that giue any credit to
such Parallells, or differ from him in those points, I will
giue no sentence against him, but referre him to reade it
in Tully,
                     Cic. de Orat.

should mistake old heresie new coyned, for current truth.
At the first setting of the Mint on work by Iames Harman
at Leyden, when a peece new stamped was transported,
and presented to King IAMES, our late Soueraigne,
of most blessed memory, vpon the very first cast of his eye,
he discouered it to be no better then an halfe faced groat
of the Semipelagian alloy. Et statim perfodit stylo Regio,
and forthwith stabbed it through with his Royall pen,
and branded the Master of the Mint with the title of the
enemie of God. And that the same iudicious King persisted

in this his iudgement, both of the Coyne and Coyners
euen to the end, to mee it is a thing most euident, by a
faithfull and allowed relation, which I haue seene of diuers
remarkable directions and instructions giuen by his
Maiesty to two Diuines, about a moneth before his death,
questioned before him about a booke then published, touching
the Doctrine of St. Austen.
                  
                  In that discourse, his Maiestie hauing occasion to touch
vpon the Treatises of St. Augustine, that are extant in the
seuenth Tome, (which hee might seeme prophetically to
recommend as a soueraine antidote against an euill vpcreeping
since his death) hee stiled them St. Austins Polemicall
tracts against the heretickes that agree with our Arminians:
and presently calling to minde their proper
name, termed those hereticks (from the Author of that
Sect) the Pelagians. Which Paraphrase of his Maiestie,
because it giueth much life to the ensuing Tablet, and this
Tablet light to his Maiesties speech, I haue made bold to
borrow the Character of the Presse, to imprint both more
deepely in thy memory: and to expresse to thee my desire
to serue as a voluntary, (as did that excellently learned
and zealous Archbishop Bradwardin) In causa Dei
contra Pelagianos, in Gods cause and quarrell against the
Pelagians.

CATALOGVE OF
THE PELAGIAN DOCtrines,

Fathers, and Councells.
                  1 THe sinne of Adam is not imputed to his postetitie.
                  2 Adam by his sinne endamaged onely himselfe properly,
but his Posteritie onely by his example,
so farre forth as they imitate him.
                  3 There is no Originall sinne, or corruption of humane nature.
                  4 Euery man is borne in the same perfection wherein Adam
was before his fall, saue onely the perfection of age, which
in his posteritie wants the vse of reason, when they are
new borne.
                  5 Temperall death is from the necessitie of nature, and did not
come vpon all the posterity of Adam, for the first sinne
of their first Parent.
                  6 Adam himselfe should have dyed by the necessitie of nature,
though he had not sinned.
                  7 Much lesse did Adam bring vpon his Postritie the guilt of
eternall death for his sinne.
                  8 Children in Baptisme doe not receiue remission of Originall
sinne.
                  
                     
9 Those who maintaine the Doctrine of Originall sinne,
condemne Marriage.
                  10 By Grace is meant Nature endued with Reason and Will.
                  11 Supernaturall grace consisteth in the Doctrine of the Law,
and pardon of sinnes.
                  12 Forgiuenesse is not necessary for all. Because all do not sin:
or at least, some may be without sinne.
                  13 Those, who haue sinned, may by the power of nature repent,
without inward grace from the spirit.
                  14 The grace of Christ is not elsewhere to be sought for, then
in the Doctrine, and life, or example of Christ.
                  15 If there bee any inward helpe receiued from the Holy
Ghost, the same consisteth onely in the enlightening
of the vnderstanding. But as for the Will, that needes
no inward grace.
                  16 Man by his naturall inbred faculties is able perfectly to
fulfill the Law.
                  17 Grace is profitable for the fulfilling of the Law, but not
necessary thereto.
                  18 Man of himselfe is able to resist the strongest temptations:
though indeed, he doth it with more facilitie, if
he be helped by grace.
                  19 By the workes of nature man promeriteth (or gayneth)
the ayde of grace.
                  20 That which proceedeth from forgetfulnesse, or ignorance,
hath not in it the property of sinne.
                  21 In the New Testament all kinde of oathes are forbidden.
                  22 Rich men, vnlesse they fell their goods, and giue them to
the poore cannot be saued.
                  23 The well vsing of free will, and of naturall powers is the
cause of Predestination.
                  24 Christ dyed not for all men: at least not for Infants; because
they are without sinne.
               
               
                  
                  The Errors of the Semipelagians
or Massilians.
                  1 THe beginning of Faith, and the desire of conuersion is
from our selues, the increase is from grace.
                  2 Man, if not alwayes, yet sometimes preuents God, by the
preparation of his owne will. By which endeauour of
nature God is moued to bring, through the ayde of his
Spirit, to the grace of regeneration the Will so prepared.
                  3 For perseuerance in Faith and Grace there is no neede of
new and speciall grace. What we haue by nature, or
haue formerly gotten by the spirit of grace, sufficeth
for such perseuerance.

Moreouer to what ende is here raked together the draffe of so
many herefies, whereof the greater part was renounced by the
Father, that begat them? As appeareth in many places of St.
Austens Treatises against his heresies. Lastly, how impertinent
are those proposions concerning oathes, rich mens goods,
and the mortalitie of Adam in the state of Innocency, &amp;c?
Who euer, so much as by dreame, did thinke to fasten this vpon
the Aminians? So that of the 24. Pelagian Positions here
rehersed, sixe onely may looke this way; namely, the third,
seuenth, tenth, fifteenth, nineteenth, three and twentieth. The

also that none iustly can be. For if so, then
                        1 God should deale more rigorously with such men, then
he doth with the Deuills.
                        2 That which is a punishment of sinne, cannot deserue eternall
punishment. For then would there be endlesse processe,
if one punishment should still deserue another.

                           Out of Aug. Epist. 105. Pelagius
by that Grace
which he acknowledged
to be giuen without any
foregoing merits, did
meane the nature of
man, wherein wee are
created. Forasmuch, as
before we had any being,
we could merit that wee
should haue a being.

The Gentiles by nature do
the things of the Law. And
how little soeuer that bee,
which a man in the estate of
Corruption can doe, God willeth
that he should do it, and
when man doth this, hee vseth
grace well.
                        
                           Item pag. 157. Vpon demand
whether a man in the estate
of corruption can rightly vse
the light of reason: he presently
resolueth, that it is required,
that a man in the
estate of Corruption doe
rightly vse that grace, which
he hath, and performe whatsoeuer
he can, by that Grace
giuen him.
                     
                     
                        It need not seeme strange that the Arminians make
Nature to be Grace, who maintaine that there is a
generall grace imprinted in all men without exception.
Which what can it bee else but Nature, and
her endowments? Now if any shall obiect, that this
in effect is nothing but an idle strife about wordes,
let him consider, that this is the hidden spring of the
most pestilent poyson of Pelagins. For out of this

may they wash away and put off any thing, that
is brought by the maintainers of Grace. If allegetion
be made against him, that We are saued by
grace. Their answere is ready. True. To witt
by nature, which is the first and generall grace.
By grace I am that I am. True. By grace, that
is by nature, whereof God is the free Donor.
Faith is the gift of God. True. Because out free-will,
by which we ascent, is the gift of God the
Creator. And if St. Austen himselfe shall presse
against them, that Grace onely discernes a beleeuer
from an vnbeleeuer. Why may they not answere.
True sir. That is, onely Free-will, which is most
freely giuen vs by God.

                           Out of Saint Austen in his
Treatise of Perseuerance.
Three points there are
which the Catholique
Church doth principally
maintaine against the Pelagians.

Whereof the first
is, that Grace is not giuen
according to our merits.
                        
                           The same Aug. Grace (according
to Pelagius) is giuen
though not according
to the desert of good
workes, yet according to
the desert of a good will.
His reason is: Otherwise
God should be an accepter
of persons, if hee should
haue mercy on whom hee
will, without any foregoing
merits.

Election dependeth vpon the
foreseene free assent of mans
will, euen then when all the helps
of sauing grace being afforded,
it may yet dissent by its owne naturall and inbred liberty: as
hereafter appeareth. Why therefore may they not climbe to the
very top of Pelagianisme, and so auow, that the good vse of our
natural freewill doth poise downe the euen balance of Gods
Praedestination, and determine the otherwise wauering decree
of God? Howsoeuer they decline the name of Cause in election,
and hold forth in stead thereof the attribute of a foregoing condition,
yet in effect they must needs hit against this rocke, at
which Pelagius suffered Shipwracke.

of nature, God is
moued to bring, through
the ayde of his Spirit, to

the Will so prepared.

They affirme the Will
to be so free, that it can of
it owne accord admit or
refuse cure or medicine.

Wills fredome, (they say)
that life is layd hold on by
those, who beleeue of
their owne accord, and
entertaine the ayde of
grace, by the merit, or act,
of their credulitie.
                        
                           Faustus. It is of the mercy
of God, that men are called:

but the following
that call, is referred to
their owne Will.

They babble vainely,
who say. To Will to
beleeue is mine, or from
me; but to helpe is of
Gods grace. Whereas
contrariwise, the Apostle
testifieth, that the very beleeuing
it selfe is giuen of
God.
                        
                           Cassianus. The whole is not
so to be ascribed to grace,
but that free Will is to
haue some share of commendation
of the forwardnesse
thereof.
                        
                           Item. Two things there are

Christs words, No man
commeth to me, vnlesse my
Father draw him; sayth,
that to drawe is nothing
else, but to preach, to stir
vp with comforts of the
Scripture, to deterre by
reproofes, to propound
things desirable, to represent

things dreadfull, to
threaten iudgement, to
promise reward.

which God vseth to the conuersion

                           Arminius against Perkins,

not, is the will of God,

will doth not vse an omnipotent

to beget faith, in men, but a
gentle swasion, and accommodated

mans will according to the
nature of its freedome.
                        
                           Item, pag. 220. The Author of
grace intendeth by grace to

a gentle and sweete swasion;
which motion doth not onely
not take away the free consent
of freewill, but also establisheth
it.

in Faith and Grace,
three needeth no new and
speciall grace. What we
either haue by nature, or
haue formerly goten by
the spirit of grace, sufficeth

for such Perseuerance.
                        The Proposition should rather
haue beene thus formed.
                        
                           Out of Saint Austin in his
Treatise of Perseuerance.
That Perseuerance to the
ende is in our power, and
is not the gift of God.
                        
                           Out of Hilar. to Aust. Neither
will they yeeld, that such
perseuerance is giuen to
any man, from which hee
is not suffered to reuolt,
but such, as from which
hee may by his Freewill
fall away.
                        
                           
This Proposition cannot be
be fairely prescribed for the true
state of the question, much lesse
for the whole question of Perseuerance.
For the Demipelagians
did not deny the ayde of new
Grace for perseuering, as is euident
by Prospers words forecicited,

God foresaw, who would
beleeue, and perseuere in that
Faith, which in processe should
be helped by Grace.

It is an act of the Will,

This Doctrine in it selfe, and
of it selfe, is an hinderance

kinde, which come from the same seede, and that
which is couched low in the roote, appeares in the
fruit. We are not therefore to skirmish against these
men with new leuied forces, nor to enter into a speciall
list, as against vnknown enemies. These meane
Engins were then shattered in pieces, then they fell
to the ground in their Companions, and ringleaders
of their pride, when Innocentius, of blessed memory,
smote the heads of this abominable error with
the dint of the Apostolicke Sword, when the Synod of
the Bishops of Palestina compelled Pelagius to pronounce
sentence against himselfe, and his followers.
                        If we tye this mishapen monster with the bands of
a Syllogisme, Proteus being fast manacled will vtter

                              Demipelagianisme is true Christianisme (Arminius

                  1 PEccatum Adami posteris ejus non imputatur.
                  2 Sibi soli Adamus peccans nocuit propriè; posteris non
nisi exemplo, quatenus imitantur.
                  3 Originale peccatum, sive naturae humanae corruptio nulla est.
                  4 Quilibet homo eâdem perfectione nascitur, quâ fuit Adam
ante lapsum, demptâ perfectione aetatis, quae in posteris recens
natis usu rationis caret.
                  5 Mors temporalis est à necessitate naturae; minime
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      propter
primi parentis primum peccatum redundavit in posteros.
                  6 Ipsemet Adam lege &amp; necessitate naturae moriturus erat,
etiamsi non peccasset.
                  7 Multo minus aeternae mortis reatum induxit posteris Adam
peccato suo.
                  8 Parvuli in Baptismo non accipiunt remissionem peccati originalis.
                  9 Qui tuentur dogma de peccato originali, damnant nuptias.
                  10 Gratia significat naturam ratione &amp; voluntate praeditam.
                  11 Supernaturalis gratia spectatur in doctrina Legis, &amp; condonatione
peccatorum.
                  12 Haec posterior, puta condon: pecc: non omnibus est necessaria.
Quia non omnes peccant, saltem possunt carere peccato.
                  
                     
13 Qui peccarunt, possunt ex naturae viribus resipiscere abs
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      interna
gratia Spiritus sancti.
                  14 Gratia Christi non alibi quaerenda, quàm in doctrina, &amp; vita,
seu exemplo Christi.
                  15 Si quod hîc obtingit auxilium internum Spiritus sancti, illud
in sola intellectus illuminatione est positum. Nullâ autem
voluntati opus est gratiâ internâ.
                  16 Homo viribus ex creatione sibi insitis legem penitus implere
potest.
                  17 Gratia ad ligis impletionē utilis quidem est, non itē necessaria.
                  18 Homo etiam gravissimis tentationibus per se potest resistere,
licèt faciliùs id praestet, si adjuvetur à gratia.
                  19 Per opera naturae homo promeretur auxilium gratiae.
                  20 Quod ab oblivione, vel ignorantia proficiscitur, non habet rationem
peccati.
                  21 In novo Testamento omne juramentum est vetitum.
                  22 Divites, nisi bona sua vendant, &amp; pauperibus dent, non possunt
servari.
                  23 Bonus usus liberi arbitrij, &amp; virium naturalium est causa praedestinationis.
                  24 Christus non est mortuus pro omnibus; saltem pro infantibus:
quia carent peccato.
               
               
                  Semipelagianorum, seu Massiliensium errores.
                  1 INitium fidei, &amp; conversionis desiderium est ex nobis, incrementum
à gratia.
                  2 Homo, si non semper, saltem aliquando praevenit Deum praeparatione
propriae voluntatis; quo naturae conatu movetur
Deus, ut voluntatem ita praeparatam auxilio Spiritus sancti
ad regenerationis gratiam perducat.
                  3 Ad perseverantiam in fide &amp; gratia non opus est novâ &amp; speciali
gratiâ: sufficit ad hoc, vel quod naturâ habemus, vel
quod semel per spiritum gratiae adepti sumus.

sunt ineunda certamina. Tunc istorum machinae fractae sunt,
tune in superbiae sociis &amp; principibus corruerunt, quando

                        Semipelagianismus est verus Christianismus (non diffitente
Arminio)
                        
                        At Semipelagianismus est Pelagianismus (statuente
Prospero)
                        
                        Ergo Pelagianismus est verus Christianismus
