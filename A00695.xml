            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            The Author to the Reader.
            
            
               IT is reported of the Philoſopher Poſidonius, that being once taken with a Diſeaſe ſo violent, as that the very Paine and Torture it put him to, made him ready to wring his Armes and craſh his teeth together, for the very anguiſh of it: Notwithſtanding he, thinking as it were to outbrave it with a proud Stoicall Patience, cries out, Nihil agis Dolor, &amp;c. Doe thy worſt, Paine; yet will I never confeſſe that thou art an Evill.
            And doe wee not in like manner

daily ſee, many brave ſpirited Gallants, ſo beſotted with ſome, perhaps but Imaginary beauty, and ſo tormented with this folly of Love, as that both their Imagination is depraved, and their Iudgement alſo utterly corrupted; who, with this ſtupid Philoſopher, are ſo farre from ſeeking a cure for this their Malady, as that they will not be perſwaded, that it is one: and therefore employ their whole ſtudy &amp; care, in chanting forth Loves Encomiums, and the praiſes of their Miſtreſſes, the ſole cauſe of their Diſtemper.
            That therefore I might let theſe men ſee the groſſeneſſe of their Errour, &amp; withall diſcover the vaineneſſe of this Stoicall Opinion of theirs: (Although I profeſſe my ſelfe to be rather Philologus then Logophilus; and account him eloquent enough, that can but cloath his own

conceptions with a bare naturall expreſſion:) I have adventured to preſent you with this litle Treatiſe, which is devoid of all Elegancy or Queintneſſe of expreſſion, as being compoſed by one that is a Profeſſor of that Faculty, that the Prince of Latine Poets called a Mute one. Wherein you ſhall finde variety of Remedies of all ſorts, for the cure of this the moſt frequent, and moſt dangerous Diſeaſe that both ſexes are ſubject to; collected out of all kinds of Authors, both Phyſitians, Poëts, and Philoſophers: that ſo you might have variety to delight you.
            Omne tulit punctum, qui miſcuit utile dulci.
            The Reaſons that moved me to write of this ſubject, after ſo many,

and ſo learned Phyſitians that have done ſo before me, are chiefly Two. The firſt is, that being my ſelfe a Practitioner in Phyſicke, I found that moſt of them handled this diſeaſe of Love-Melancholy, indifferently, as the other kindes of Melancholies and Madneſſes; never ſhewing preciſely the cauſe and ſeat of this Malady: and that, both to the great prejudice of the Parties affected, and alſo their own no ſmall amazement and confuſion, not finding thoſe effects, that they promiſe themſelves, of their Phyſicall Preſcriptions.
            The ſecond reaſon that moved me to attempt this diſcourſe, was, to confute the erroneous and impious opinion of ſome Phyſitians, hereafter mentioned, who although they are Chriſtians, the moſt of them, doe notwithſtanding preſcribe

for the cure of this diſeaſe, Luſt, and Fornication. But I doubt not, I ſhall ſufficiently refute theſe men, in this enſuing diſcourſe; and that by ſtrong and evident reaſons, both Naturall and Morall: and the reſt I ſhall leave to Divines.
            
         
         
            
            
               To the Learned Authour on his Love-Melancholy.
            
               THou, that from this Gay Title, look'ſt no high'r
               Then ſome Don Errant, or his fullſome Squire:
               Who count'ſt the price a Damage, if thou meet
               No litle Cupid wrapt in every ſheet:
               Sufely abhorre the bargaine of his Lure;
               Leaſt vnawares, perhaps, thou buy a Cure.
               'Las, miſerable Lover! What ſad plight
               Would vexe thy ſoule, ſhould'ſt thou be well ere night!
               Shouldſt thou forget thy Poſtures! ſhouldſt thou weare
               Armes of thy owne; not folded to Despaire!
               An high, erected Forehead! thy diſcourſe
               Flow on ſecurely; with no ſigh made hoarſe!
               What if theſe Ills befall thee, that from hence
               Thou ſhouldſt, perhaps, recover Braine, and Sence?
               How couldſt thou beare the ſtroake, if from this Pen
               Thou didſt grow ſound, and riſe up man agen?
            
            
               Theſe are our Authours vices; to apply
               
                  
A Cordiall, where the Patient faine would dy.
               Count not th' Erratas then: ſince if it be
               Solid, and firme; there all the miſtakes ly.
               Poore, humble ſpirit! Fondly to behold
               The painted Droſſe, yet ſtartle at the Gold.
               Mai'ſt thou henceforth thy penſion beſtow,
               Inſtead of Bookes, only to graſpe a ſhow.
               Thy Pageant-ſtudy be adorn'd, and hung
               With Leaves, not ſo well writ, as fairely ſtrung.
               Good lucke to thy Gilt-Leather. Such as, no doubt,
               Is a good worke, till th' Ribband's all worne out.
               Yet, if thou canſt not forme thy wanton Eye
               To read a page more ſerious then thee.
               Jf thy ſad Pill muſt be diſguis'd, and woo
               Thy Palat with a Candid hoary dew.
               Expect no Tearmes, or Notions here: the ſtile
               Is not preſcribed; taſts leſſe o'th' ſhop, then File.
               Few Drammes, or Scruples grate thy tender Eare:
               No Opiats, or Gargariſmes here.
               Nothing to ſowre thy lookes: no Auſtere phraſe,
               Which might perplexe thee, worſe then thy diſeaſe.
               A ſtraine, harſh as th' Ingredients; ſuch, as wee
               Shall need no other Drugs to vomit by.
               Here, all, like thy owne Miſtreſſe, ſmooth appeares.
               Stories, like thoſe ſhe tells thee, apt, and cleare.
               Such Elegancies interweav'd, you might
               Doubt, if he was Phyſitian, did write.
            
            
               
               If you would know how far Love reignes, here One
               Rages, inamour'd of a cold, pale ſtone.
               He ſues t' his Patient Idoll, as the Clay
               Might be a Bride, ere Pyrrha threw't away.
               One courts his owne faire Picture, as if he
               Might, to himſelfe, both Nymph, and Husband be.
               Like thoſe Androgynes, which here you find,
               In the ſame Body t' involve either kind.
               Here one courts life: yet ſo, ſhe cannot ſpit,
               But the Officious Sr, will gather it.
               Another doth on wrinkles doat as faſt;
               And th' Chin, that drops it ſelfe downe to the Waſt.
               Her hollow cheeke love's Temple, doth appeare.
               Her Eye! That kills not with a Beame too cleare:
               And, ſure, th' Experienc'd Maid will paſſe on, free
               From that young ſinne, the ſale of chastity,
               A Dame, ſo modeſt, no Bribe can intice:
               So coy, that ev'n to her owne bed ſhee's Ice.
               Her Noſe can't be ſo vast, but he will raiſe
               A Trumpet thence, to Eccho forth her praiſe.
               And though, all ore, It ſure a Monſter be,
               Yet, whilſt his fit laſts, 'tis a Deity.
            
            
               But whilſt I thus bragge colour, J prophane
               The Nerves and Marrow of thy Weighty Veine:
               Who ſound'ſt the depth of Authors, and canſt tell
               Where Galen, and Hippocrates doe well:
               Yet where they erre too, 'Tis not all thy skill,
               
                  
Aw'd at ſome mighty Name, there to ſtand ſtill.
               As if, in your profeſſion, 'twere a ſinne
               To out-goe Galens ſober Diſcipline.
               Thou doſt not bind thy liberall Art to come
               Within the compaſſe of One Axiome:
               Nor yet of One tongue: Who art Criticke growne
               As well in Language as in Potion.
               Greek, Latine, French, Italian, all, ſo much
               Thy owne, we doubt, whether thy Nurſe were ſuch.
               And yet, through all this danger of thy skill,
               Thou doſt retaine God, and Religion ſtill.
               Hence, then, with thoſe raſh clamours, which apply
               A prophane ſtampe to that bleſt Faculty.
               Amongst whom Charity is ſlander, Sure
               This is no piece of Atheiſme to Cure.
               Health is the gift of Heaven. Nor dare I
               Thinke't may be ſtollen thence, through Blaſphemy.
               May ſuch Defamers, then, converted be
               By a Reforming Gout, or their owne Fee.
               May they be rack'd, and tortur'd, till they doe
               Send for Phyſitian, and adore him too.
               Till they, to him, pay their Devotion;
               And, almoſt, are, themſelves the Atheiſts growne.
               Let them be Wild, and Melancholy looke,
               Nor find one Remedy through all this Booke.

               CƲpid, th' art idle: lend another dart;
               'Tis poore, to triumph ore a ſingle Heart.
               Ben't partiall, ſtrike 'em both; that we may find,
               Th' art truly Iuſtice, not in an Embleme, blind.
               Let all thy ſhafts be golden ones, be't prophane,
               T'approach thy Altars, with a Veſtall flame.
            
            
               What a hard caſe 'tis, to ſee thy Votaries,
               With their neglected Hats, pull'd downe their eyes,
               Looke like ſo many Cupids? but that they
               Can't make their Ladies ſqueake, as Cupid may.
               Pray y' pitty him, Lady! How you make him looke!
               His cloathes he weares, as if he had miſtooke
               One peice for t'other; and you may ſafely ſweare,
               Though he ſeeme dreſt, yet they ſtill ſcatter'd are.
               His buttons, (like Tarquins Poppy heads) fall down,
               Some halfe a dozen at a ſigh; and's Crowne
               Is grown bald with ſcratching Tunes out: ſuch ſtuffe,
               As I conceive the Spaniard in the ruffe,
               Woes his ſword with. Another dolefull Wight.
               
                  
Strucke into a deepe Melancholy plight,
               Becauſe (forſooth) his Miſtris does but frowne;
               Thinking to ſhew a worſe face then her owne,
               For a foyle (poore Vnthrift!) ſtraight runs out
               Of all the wit he has; and layes about,
               (As he were wood) to make ſome Anagram;
               (Hoping ſhee'le prove as fruitfull as her Name)
               Or ſome pure Dialogue; which He, alone,
               Repeates to her; all in one, conſtant Tone,
               Like th' fellow that tell's billets out, or rather
               Like him, that playes (without a pipe) o' th' Tabor.
               This is your doing, Cupid; 'tis a plaine Caſe,

               And learne to speake your Mother-tongue agen;
               (For, this you ne're were borne to) talke in Proſe,
               Like ſager Common-wealths-men in Trunke-Hoſe.
            
            
               Had the blind God more fiercely wounded thee,
               Then the twelve ſignes doe the Anatomy;
               Did'ſt never woe her, but in the diſmall Tone
               Of King Darius: and did'ſt then put on
               A Face ſuitable, that one might doubt, whether
               Thou wer't not ſome clown, praying for faire weather;
               Were thy ſtory of as much direfull woe,
               As that, of Iuliet and Hieronymo:
               
               Here's that would cure you: better farre, then e're

               MEthinkes a spruce Sr Amorous I spy,
               In quest of his adored Miſtreſſe Eye.
               His Lookes, his Geſture, Garments, Haire, and all,
               Compos'd exactly Geometricall.
               As if that he aſſured were to prove,
               At firſt aſſault, a Conquerour in Love.
               
               Each glaunce of's Eye, each ſtep he takes, declare
               What the moſt hidden thoughts of his Heart are.
               Nay, by that very Nod, I plainly ſee
               What his ſaluting Complement will be.
               Yet, thinkes he, he is in a cloſer ſhrowd,
               Then was Aeneas in his Mother's Clowd.
               Dreames, the moſt piercing Lvnceus can't detect,
               What the Marke is, at which he does direct

All this his ſervice. Nay, he's confident,
               His Sylvia nere ſhall spy out his intent:
               But yield her Fort, ere the firſt Onſet's made;
               That he may boast, with what no paines he had
               Obtain'd his wiſht-for Conquest. Heightned thus,
               With more then promiſe of a prosperous
               Succeſſe, away he marches: whilſt his Feet,
               And nimble Pulſe, in the ſame meaſure meet.
               Both keepe a Triple-time: untill by chance,
               On the next ſtall caſting a careleſſe glaunce,
               He ſpies Thee, (litle Booke:) ſurprized much
               With thy bare Title-page alone, (for ſuch
               A Sympathy betwixt his thoughts there is,
               And all diſcourſe of Love,) he stops: will miſſe
               His preſent Viſit, hoping here to find
               Somewhat, may better his Enamour'd mind,
               In Courtſhip of his Saint. But, reading ore
               Each part, he ſees, (what did lye hid before,)
               His owne Diſeaſe: and, by Love-Melancholy,
               
               Can eas'ly cenſure his owne ſerious Folly.
               And now, unto his owne Diſcovery
               As open lyes, as he did erſt to me.
            
            
               Into a ſudden Cure thus cheated, he,
               Leaving his Sylvia, falls in Love with thee.

               To the Authour, on his Love-Melancholy.
            
               
                  LOve, who, till now, was looſenes and hot Flame,
               Js here made warmth; &amp; joyes he is grown Tame.
               The Wanton's ſober, here: this Artiſt brings
               The Boy, as comely ſtill yet clip's his wings.
               Looke on his Bluſhes, his Cheekes modeſt fires.
               There's the ſame Roſe, only 't hath loſt the Briers.
               He, ſtill his Jvory Bow, ſtill keepes his Dart:
               Shootes here too, but with Judgement, and more Art.
            
            
               He is not not now call'd Luſt, or Amorous ſtaines:
               (As if the God i'th' ſhrine, were Sinne i'th' Veines.)
               Nor yet a perfect Birth: he muſt not ſhine,
               Blind, in his Mothers armes, yet ſee in Thine.
               Thus, th' Authour Iudge 'twixt us and Cupid, hee
               Nor takes from man, nor ſlatters Deitie.
               But, like an equall Flame, doth light impart,
               To ſhew the Beauty, yet not hide the Wart.
               For, had he made Love, Good, and our Deſire,
               Without our reaſon, or wills awe, Entire:
               Then Ʋertue had been Nature; and We, been
               
                  
Good without praiſe; 'cauſe without pow'r to ſin.
               
                  Lucrece had loſt the merit of her Care,
               Were ſhe as eas'ly Chaſt, as ſhe was Faire.
               Ice, had been rank'd with Ʋertue: we ſhould know
               Chast Ʋirgins, Chronicled with coldeſt ſnow.
               
                  Romans, that ſtory Beauties free from ſin,
               Had ſearch'd their Gardens, and put Lillies in.
               Roſes had then heard, modeſt: and one line
               Made Veſta's Bluſhes, and her Rubies joyne.
               And the dejected Goddeſſe weep, to ſee
               Her Chriſtalls, Pure, and Ʋertuous, as ſhe.
            
            
               No ſuch Poſition then. For here our Love
               May be, or that o'th' ſparrow, or Chaſt Dove.
               The Flames here drawne, nor Good, nor Bad: but are
               Apt, or to ſhine a Comet, or a ſtarre.
               They are themſelves, Indifferent: and may
               Riſe to a raging Blaze, or temp'rate Ray.
               The Picture, doubtfull like the Face, may prove
               In thy breaſt, either Divell, or God of Love.
            
            
               No Galen here, that may confine the ſoule
               To th' Temper; and call't Vice, when the Bodies foule
               Potions might ſo make honest men; and awe
               Our Crimes, like ſcarres; and plaisters ſtand for law
               Fevers, and luſt, were One, and both would heale
               By Iuleps; and men take Pills, not to ſteale.
               The Iudgement's ſubt'ler, here; and hath allow'd
               Some parch'd Moores, chaſt: light, wrap'd in that black clowd.
               
                  
Here Scythians breaſts of hot deſire have ſenſe:
               Nor, with their Furres, ſtill put on Innocence.
               Yet, he ſtill grants, theſe Flames may ſooner grow,
               Jn Eaſterne ſulphur, then in Northerne ſnow:
               And, that chaſt thoughts in Italy are rare:
               And, that each Turtle, proves a Phoenix there.
            
            
               He envies no Climes Vertue, as none's ſin:
               Yet knowes, that ſome an eaſier Conqueſt win.
               All may be chast, for him: yet, 'tis well knowne,
               This Iewell is ſome Climats common ſtone.
            
            
               Thus the wiſe Authour makes his Iuſtice ſure:
               Allowes all Rich, but thoſe that will be Poore.

               COme hither, fond Idolater, and ſee
               The confutation of that Deity,
               Thy Dotage has created. Heretofore,
               Mens ready ſuperſtition did adore
               
                  
                  Paleneſſe, and Fevers: things, to which they cou'd
               Say, hurt us not; could not ſay, doe us good.
               Gods, only to beware of; ſuch, as they
               Worſhip't Aloofe, begging 'hem keepe away,
               And bleſſe them with their abſence. Temples, were
               But glorious priſons, to detaine 'hem there.
            
            
               Iuſt ſuch a one is thine. If you but pleaſe
               Read here, thou'lt find, thy Idol's thy diſeaſe:
               Thou fall'ſt downe to thy Rheume. Ile not ſtick
               
                  To ſay, the Lover is of's God fall'n ſick
            
            
               View then this Mirrour, (hereby thou maiſt know
               'Tis true, ev'n 'cauſe 't does thee not ſingle ſhow:)
               Looke on thy Metamorphoſis; behold,
               Thou, that waſt one, art now grown Manifold:
               Increas'd, 'cauſe thou wouldſt multiply: new made
               Each ſilent minute; whilſt this ſhewes thee ſad,
               In a dull ſleepy poſture, one might ſay,
               Thou 'rt ſtatue; did not ſighs ſome life betray.
               I th' next, thou ſtart'ſt; art ſometimes pale; and then
               A tell tale Bluſh colours thy cheeke agen.
               Now, a forc't ſmile; anon, a willing teare
               Breakes forth: thy Doubtfull looks, all ſeaſons weare
               And all tis, to deſerve the love of your
               (By you ſtil'd Lady) Splay-footed Foureſcore:
               
               Or perhaps Older. One, more fit to be
               Bedfellow with an Incubus, then thee.
               Such women have been lov'd, and ſworne to be
               
                  
Goddeſſes. (Sure for their Antiquity)
               But, what's all this? Yet, thou doſt only find,
               Thou 'rt ſicke: read on; a Remed's behind.
               But is there any Cure? the moſt conceive
               Love, no diſeaſe: and they, that doe believe
               Tis one, eſteem't Incurable. But O,
               Art's much improv'd: and that made eaſy now,
               Was once impoſſible. Phyſitians can
               Heale, not the body only, but the Man:
               See his ſoule right againe. Hee'l now no more
               Pule, 'cauſe a woman's wayward, as before.
               Dart all your Beames (faire Ladies:) for, be ſure,
               The threatned wounds, I can prevent, and Cure.
               This Booke's both Charme, and Medicine. I can beare
               My Antidote about me every where.
               Knowing it's Vertue, 't may be my deſire,
               Sometimes to feele, that I may quench the fire.
            
            
               For, though J burne a while, I can the ſame
               Riſe (Phoenix like) unhurt, from mine owne flame.

That gilds as ſhee walks by the glittering ſtreams.
               If ſhe would part, Farewell: when ſhe is gone
               Methinks I now ſhould live, nere turn'd to ſtone.

               J ſhould nere light a candle, as if twere night
               Pray her to riſe that we might ſee the light.
               When we were in the darke, Jde hardly ſay,
               After my ſhinnes were broke it was noon day.

               Now I have read this book, methinks one might

               The Meadows with her looks, and ſo farre bleſſe
               The Country, as be preſent for to deck
               The ground with lilies dropping from her neck.
               I'de not mistake her cheeks for Gardens, ſweare
               There were no Roſes in the world, but there.
               If I now fluent were as th' Innes of Court,
               My. Muſc ſhould here run out to make her ſport.
               Nor would I write o'th' thorn that knew the charm
               A Beauty has, when't did her foot no harme.
               For Venus coud not ſcape a wound, yet this

               Our Bedds are Altars now, where refind Hearts

               Sickneſſe doth often make us good; but then

                  IT may ſeem at the firſt view a vaine and idle enterpriſe to goe about to preſcribe remedies for the cure of Love: Which all, both Poets, Philoſophers, and ancient Divines,

have ever acknowledged to be the originall and cauſe of all good: (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , Ariſt. Met. 1. c. 4. ſaies the Philoſopher: Love is the cauſe of all good: as contrarywiſe hatred, of all evill. It is the Modell of Iuſtice, Temperance, Plat. conv. Fortitude, and Prudence: the firſt inventor of Phyſick, Poetry, Muſick, and all Plutar. Symp. Liberall Arts; the moſt noble, moſt powerfull, &amp; moſt Ancient of all thoſe Gods, the ſuperſtitious Heathen framed to themſelves out of their own braine. Should I indeed ſpeake any thing againſt this Love; I might juſtly be thought worthy the ſame puniſhment the Poet Stefichorus ſuffered, for ſpeaking ill of the beauteous Helen: who was therefore puniſhed with blindneſſe, till he had recanted his error. Beſides, that in writing againſt this love, I ſhould doe injury to the Art of Phyſick, which I profeſſe: ſeeing that Plato, under the perſon of Eryximachus 
                  Plat. conv. the Phyſitian, ſaies, that Phyſick is nothing elſe, but 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

Evacuation and Repletion. So that he that in this caſe can diſtinguiſh betwixt honeſt and diſhoneſt love, is to be

Fulgent. mythol. commonly called Pandemia, or Vulgar: ſo likewiſe are there two Amores, Sonnes of theſe two Godeſſes; the one Divine, and the other common and vulgar. Of theſe two kindes of Love, the Supernaturaliſts and Divines diſcourſe of the eſſence and properties of the former: and the Phyſitian of the later. Which againe is either honeſt or diſhoneſt: they teach the means of preſerving the former, during the tearme of Marriage; and preſcribe remedies for the cure, and prevention of the Later; with the fury whereof Ignoble and degenerate ſpirits are for the moſt part violently carried away.
               The Greekes feigne that Apollo had two ſonnes, Aeſculapius and Plato: this, for to cure the maladies of the mind,

                  Aeſculapius for thoſe of the Body. Now love being a mixt diſeaſe, both of the body and the mind; I ſhall furniſh my ſelfe with precepts out of Plato, and with me dicines from Aeſculapius, in the cure of Love Melancholy, being ſuch as I have gathered out of Hippocrates, the Prince of Phyſitians: Intending to handle Love no otherwiſe, then as it is a paſſion, or violent perturbation of the Mind, Diſhoneſt, and Refractory to Reaſon.

               But my chiefeſt purpoſe is, to preſcribe ſome remedies for the prevention of this diſeaſe of Love, which thoſe men for the moſt part are ſubject unto, that have not the power to governe their deſires, and ſubject them to Reaſons Lawes: ſeeing that this unchaſt Love proves oftentimes the Author of the greateſt Miſchiefes that are in the world, as they are reckoned up by Plautus.

               Which hath given occaſion to a late French Poet to feigne, that on a day, Venus left whipping of her ſonne Cupid, and afterward bound him to a Myrtle tree. Intimating by this Poeticall fiction, that Pleaſure many times puniſheth Lovers with ſcourges, ſignified by his purple wings, which, according to Guitton d' Arezzo, are the Hieroglyphicks of griefe, and cruell torment. And Petrarch, in his 4. cap. del Triomfo d' Amore, feignes him to be lodged in a palace of Hopes; which makes all perſons, of what condition, or ſexe ſoever, deſire to be entertained there: But the more they labour to aſcend, the lower ſtill they fall, becauſe the ſtaires that lead up to this palace are of

a very ſlippery ſubſtance. The three firſt ſteps are, the immodeſt caſt of the eyes, ſuperfluity of words, &amp; the violence of the hands: the upper chambers are adorned with Idleneſſe, dreames, vaine deſires, and inconſtancy: the chimney of the great hall, is the breaſt of the Lover; that of the chamber is his heart; and his liver, that of the Kitchen. The ſeats of thoſe that come thither, and are entertained there, are falſe contents, on which they are no ſooner ſetled, but they break under them. Which to repaire, they preſently ſend for their engineeres, envy, torment, and deceit. Suſpence, and feare, are the ſureſt guardians of this palace, the gates whereof are ſhut up at night by falſe opinion, and Diſtruſt ſtands ſentinell, &amp;c. Which Apollonius Thyaneus having well Philoſtr. l. 1. cap. 23. conſidered, being one day ſollicited by the King of Babylon to invent ſome ſtrange kind of puniſhment for an Eunuch that had been taken in the very Act with one of the Kings Concubines, made him this anſwere, that he ſhould ſuffer him ſtill to live, and purſue his own unchaſt deſires: then which there could not a

greater puniſhment be found. For the beginnings of Luſt are Feares; Ruine attends it in the midſt of its courſe; and Repentance concludes it: As you ſhall ſee more cleerely, when I ſhall have diſcovered unto you the ordinary Symptomes of

               CHAP. II. The Symptomes of Love Melancholy.
               
               THe diverſe and violent perturbations which afflict the mind of a Paſſionate Lover, are the cauſes of greater miſchiefes, then any other paſſion of the mind whatſoever. For although we read 
                     •

ſhame, as it is ſtoried of Homer, that it kil led him, becauſe he was not able to reſolve the Fiſhermans riddle: And Macrina, the wife of Torquatus, through an earneſt deſire ſhe had to ſee a one-eyed Aegyptian that was to paſſe by her doore, her husband being abroad; at which time Modeſty permitted not women ſo much as to looke out at a window, or to be ſeen at their doores, during the time of their husbands abſence. Yet notwithſtanding, all theſe Paſſions in ſome caſes, and to ſome men prove oftentimes of good uſe, and very needfull: and for this cauſe are reckoned by Phyſitians among the ſixe Non-naturall things. For, Anger, although ſometimes it come within a degree of Madneſſe, Ira Furor brevis eſt, yet may it doe much good upon thoſe that are of an idle, heavy, drowſy, dull, cold, pale conſtitution. So likewiſe Feare is a kind of Phyſick to Fooles, Raſh, Frantick, Madmen: Sadneſſe to thoſe that are of a Malapert, jeering humour: and Shame, to thoſe that are Impudent, brazen-faced, and ſuch as have loſt their colour. But love ſeems not to be of any uſe at all, but is like

that kind of Paſſion which Avicen, as An
                     
                        •
                     geas Alphagus reports him, calls Hea, in is Arabique tongue, which conſiſts for he moſt part of many contrary motions, as by and ſadnes, feare, and deſpaire, friendſhip and hatred, &amp;c.
               
                  
                     Odi, &amp; Amo: quare id faciam fortaſſe requiris: Catul.
                     
                     Neſcio; ſed fieri ſentio, &amp; excrucior.
                  
                  
                     I love, and hate at once: yet cannot tell,
                     Why two ſuch Torments in one breaſt ſhould dwell.

                     Hàc Amor, hàc Odium; ſed puto vincet Amor.
                  
               
               Yet I grant that love is the ground and Principall cauſe of all our Affections, and the Abſtract of all the Paſſions and perturbations of the mind. For when we deſire to enjoy what we affect, whether it be really good, or but ſo in appearance; this we call covetouſneſſe, and Concupiſcence. And being not able to compaſſe our deſires, this we call Griefe, and Deſpaire:

when we enjoy the thing we deſire, Love then takes upon it the name of Pleaſure &amp; Delight. When we think we are able to effect our deſires, 'tis then Hope: and fearing to looſe it, either wholy, or in part only; this we call Iealouſie.
               By reaſon of theſe perturbations of the mind, the bloud becomes aduſt, earthy, and Melancholy, as in all other violent paſſions, except joy, according to Galen:

Athenian did the like, for the love of a Marble ſtatue: which had alſo happened not long ſince to a rich Merchant of Arles, had he not been cured of his Frenſy by the learned Valleriola, as himſelfe tells the ſtory in his Obſervations, Sapho the

               For which cauſe, the Ancient Poets Higin. c. 184. Hom. odys. 1. ſhadowing truth under the veile of Fables, feigned, that Theophanes his Courtiers were all tranſformed into Wolves: as 
                     Ʋliſſes companions were by Circe into Swine.
               
                  Galen, and all his Sectaries affirme, that Feare, and Sadneſſe are the true Characters, Lib. 6. de Sympt. cauſ. &amp; l. 3. de loc. aff. and inſeparable Accidents of Melancholy, and are cauſed by the blackneſſe of this humour. And they are of opinion, that by reaſon of the Animall ſpirits being ſullied by thoſe blacke vapours that ariſe from the Melancholy blood, all objects preſent themſelves to the Imagination in a terrible and fearefull ſhape. For as we ſee that the darkneſſe of the night works ordinarily ſome kind of feare and affright in fooles and children: in like manner are thoſe perſons that are Melancholy, in a continuall feare, as if they had a perpetuall night and darkneſſe in their braine. Which Lib. 5. Col. c. ult. opinion of theirs the ſubtile Averroës
                  
could not reliſh: but jeering Galen for it,

                  roduce effects contrary to thoſe of Heat. Now Heat, we know, makes men hardy, 
                     •
                  rong, and lively in all their Actions: whereas on the other ſide, Cold renders them fearefull, heavy, and dull. And hence 
                     •
                  t is, that we find Eunuches, old men, and women, to bee more fearefull then any other; the manners and affections of the mind following ſtill the Temperature of the body: according to Galens opinion.
               Yet I thinke, with the learned Andreas 
                  Tract. de Mel. cap. 5. 
                  Laurentius, that it were no hard matter to reconcile theſe two great Doctors, that ſeem to ſtand at ſuch a diſtance 
                     •
                  n their opinions: and this to be done, only by joyning theſe two cauſes together, which they have delivered diſtinctly and apart: and ſaying, that the Temperature of the Humour ſhould be the Principall and

Primary cauſe, which yet muſt alſo be ſeconded by the black Tincture caſt upon the ſpirits by the Melancholy vapour: which being very cold, not only refrigerates the braine, but alſo the heart, which is the ſeat of that couragious faculty which they call Iraſcible, and abates the heat of it: whence preſently followes Feare. The ſame Humour, being alſo blacke, makes the Animall ſpirits groſſe, darke, and full of fumes; which ſhould be cleare, pure, ſubtile and lightſome. Now the Spirits being the cheife and principall Organ of the ſoule, if they be both cold and blacke together, they muſt neceſſarily hinder it's nobleſt faculties, and eſpecially the fancy, alwaies repreſenting unto it black species, and ſtrange Phantaſmes: which alſo may be perceived plainly by the eyes, notwithſtanding their reſidence is within the braine: as Laurentius proves it by the inſtance of thoſe that are now ready to be taken with a ſuddaine violent Eruption of blood at the Noſe.
               Now concerning deſire, which is the efficient cauſe of Love-Melancholy, I ſhall here relate you a pleaſant ſtory out of

                  Plato in his Conviv: where he brings in Diotimus diſcourſing to Socrates the manner how love was begotten, which was thus. On a time, on Venus birth day, the Gods met all together at a great Feaſt; and among the reſt came Porus, the God of plenty, and ſonne of Counſell. When ſupper was done, there comes to the floore Penia, poverty, begging for ſome of the reliques of their feaſt. Now Porus being well warm'd with Nectar, went forth into Jupiters Garden; where being overtaken with a deep ſleep, Penia comes and lyes downe by him; and by this deviſe was got with child by him, and ſo brought forth Love: who ſtill retaining the condition of his Mother, is alwaies poore, leane, ſordid, goes bare-foot, wandring about the world without any dwelling, without covering, ſleeping in Porches, and in the ſtreets: But taking alſo after his Father, he oftimes brings to paſſe great and worthy matters, is manly, couragious, eager, cautelous, alwaies contriving ſome ſtrange ſtratagems, crafty, ingenious, a great Philoſopher, Inchanter, Sorcerer, &amp; a ſubtile Sophiſter. To omit the diverſe waies of

Allegorizing this Fable, reckoned up by Plutarch, Marſilius Ficinus, Plotinus, Picus Mirandula, and many other of the Academicks: my opinion is, that by Penia, or Poverty is repreſented unto us the Lover: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , ſaith Ariſtotle, 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Probl. l. 7. Sect. 3. Love, ſaies he, is a kind of deſire; and deſire, a kind of want or poverty. Porus is the perſon that is worthy to be beloved, yet cares not to be ſo: who notwithſtanding in ſleeping, when as the eyes of his ſoule are brought aſleep by the Poppy ſeed of Inconſideration and careleſneſſe, without any regard of the Imperfections of his Love, he ſatisfies his pleaſures.

Such was the opinion of Epicurus, who, as Plutarch relates, affirmed, that here were certaine species that flowed In Eror. from the loved Object, which moved and cauſed a kinde of Titillation over the whole body, ſliding and paſſing gently in the ſeed, by a certaine diſpoſition of A

                  omes; and ſo were the cauſe of love. Plato thought it was engendred by an Enthuſiaſme, or Divine Rapture. But I ſhall rather conclude, with Galen, that the Efficient cauſe of this Malady, is, whatſoever Lib. de diff. morb. can cauſe Love &amp; Melancholy. This Efficient L. Therap. L. de cauſ. Procat. cauſe is of two kinds, either Internall; or Externall, Evident, Manifeſt, and Procatarcticke; which the ſame Author ſometimes calls 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , the apparant true Cauſe.
               The evident cauſes of Love, according to the doctrine of the Morall Philoſophers, &amp; Platoniſts, are five; to wit, the five Senſes: which the Poets underſtood by their fiction of the five golden ſhafts of Cupid.

               So that when we read in Philoſtratus that Paris and Helen were the firſt that ever were in love without having ſeen one another, we are to underſtand that this love was extraordinary, and out of ſome ſpeciall grace granted them by the Immortall Gods, for ſome ſecret ends of theirs.
               
                  Juvenall ſpeakes of a blind man in Love, as of a prodigy: yet we read in Marius Equicola of a certaine great Lord named L. 5. de Amor. c. 3. 
                  Ianfre Rudels, that was in love with the Counteſſe of Tripoly before hee had ever ſeen her, only at the report of thoſe that came from thoſe parts unto Bourdelois: and he was ſo extreamely enamoured of her, that he could not forbeare, but preſently

               To theſe objections we anſwer, without laying falſe witneſſe to the charge of theſe Hiſtorians, that one ſwallow makes no ſummer: And that all thoſe Accidents which are Rare and ſingular, acknowledge Fortune for their Authour: whereas on the contrary,

bookes, and which diſcourſe of ſeed, Generation, and many ſecret diſeaſes, concerning the Impotency of men, and Barrenneſſe of women: which Phyſitians are wont to diſcourſe of in tearmes, though groſſe enough, yet very neceſſary. For it is impoſſible, as Celſus obſerves, to follow Lib. 6. de Re. Med. c. 18. the precepts of this our Art, and withall preſerve the modeſty of language: whatſoever Manard l. 7. ep. med. ep. 2. any Impertinent Ariſtarchus, or cenſorious Criticks alleadge to the contrary. The Fabulous Love-ſtories of the Poets, or laſcivious ſongs and ſonnets are much more effectuall in this caſe, and carry more danger in them.

               To theſe other allurements and provocations to Love, cauſed by the hearing, we might adde Muſicke. For, as Boethius affirmes, the Phrygian Mood had ſuch a

                   power to raviſh the ſpirits, that a young man that had his wench kept from him by another, his rivall, by hearing this Mood plaied, was ſo tranſported with Fury, that in all haſt he would needs have ſet fire on the houſe where ſhe was, had he not beene reſtrained by the wiſdome of Pythagoras, who commanded the Muſitian to change the Mood; and ſo by playing the Doricke, he reſtored him to his former ſober temper againe. Yet ſometimes, I confeſſe, the performance is ſo bad; that what with the harſhneſſe of the ſingers voyce, and alſo the ungracefullneſſe of his ſinging, the Muſicke proves rather a

                  , the Privy Members of Saturne, whence the Poets fetch 
                     Ʋenus Deſcent: as alſo Plato affirmes, in Phaedro. And her ſonne Cupid alſo was drawne by the Painter Praxiteles with a ſmiling countenance.

               Kiſſes are yet much more dangerous then Smiles, as the Poet Moſchus aſſures us: and Anthol. l. 1 which is alſo confirmed by Socrates, in Plato.
               
               ſunt oſcula noxia: in Ipſis Sunt venena labris.
               They carry poyſon along with them.
               It is true indeed that in ſome countries, as in France, the uſe of kiſſing is not ſo frequent, as it is in Italy, Spaine, &amp; England: where they have a cuſtome, alwaies to kiſſe at their firſt ſalutation. But this cuſtome is conceaved by Michaell Montaigne, 
                  Lib. 3. c. 4.
                  
to be ſomewhat injurious to Ladies; in that they are hereby bound in civility to afford their Lip to every ſilken coxcombe, that has but a Page at his heels, how ill ſoever they like him.
               And here by the way wee are to obſerve, Lib. 1. de cauſ. Proc. with Galen, that theſe externall cauſes have no power at all, but upon unworthy and Ignoble ſpirits, and ſuch as are in a great diſpoſition to evill: And for this cauſe, ſome Phyſitians will not have them called the Cauſes, but the Occaſions only of this diſeaſe: to which notwithſtanding it is not ſafe for any man voluntarily to expoſe himſelfe. For hee that wilfully runnes upon a danger, ſhall fall in the ſame.
               We will then reduce them all methodically into ſix heads; to wit, Aire, Meats, Exerciſe, or Reſt; Waking or Sleeping: Excretion, or Retention; and the Paſſions of the Minde.
               Concerning the Firſt, Hippocrates ſaies, that thoſe that inhabit the more Northerne Countries, as the Scythians, and Lib. de aëre loc. &amp; aq. 
                  Sarmatians, are very litle ſubject to this diſeaſe of Love: and if ſo, the contrary

conſequence then muſt neceſſarily hold good, concerning thoſe that are expoſed to a hotter Aire, as are the Aegyptians, Arabians, Moores, and Spaniards: &amp; this Avic. l. 3. fen. 20. tr. 1 c. 25. is confirmed by daily experience. Heſiod affirmes that women are more prone to wantonneſſe in ſummer, and men in winter: Rhaz. 24. cont. and proves this his opinion, by the ſame reaſons that are alleaged by Ariſtotle in his Problems, for confirmation of the ſame aſſertion. To which I will adde this generall poſition out of Hippocrates, in his book de Aer. loc. &amp; aq. where hee ſaith, that 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . The Inward &amp; Principall parts of the Body doe change their complexion and Temperature, as the Seaſons alter: whence hee concludes, that Aſtronomy is very neceſſary for all thoſe that profeſſe Phyſick. But Aristotle goes farther yet, where he ſaith, that 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : ſect. 14. Prob. 1. the goodneſſe of the Temperature, which ſtill depends much upon the Aire, conduceth much to the cleareneſſe of the underſtanding. Which gave occaſion to Galen to write

that Book of his, where hee labours to prove, that the Manners of the Minde, follow the Temperature of the Body: In which, as alſo in his other writings he impiouſly diſputeth, at leaſt erroneouſly, concerning the Soule: as alſo many other heathen Philoſophers beſides him have done.
               The Aſtrologers, for the moſt part, are not content to allow, with the Phyſitians, that theſe effects are produced oftimes, and indirectly, by the manifeſt Qualities of the Aire, cauſed by the Influence of the Coeleſtiall bodies: but are bold to attribute this power to the Planets alſo: ſaying, that the Soule holds its judgement of Saturne; Actions, of Iupiter; of Mars, Courage and Magnanimity, Senſes, of the Sun; Life, of the Moone; and laſtly of 
                     Ʋenus who is Hot, moderately moiſt, and of Benevolent Influence, Love.
               I will not here ſtand to diſpute whether or no the Stars have any power at all to work by their Influence either on our Minde, or Body: I ſhall handle this Queſtion hereafter more at large. I ſhall only in this place let you know, that it is the opinion of the Iudiciary Aſtrologers, that

the Starres have power to work both on the Body, and the Minde, indirect â motione, &amp; contingenter: non directè &amp; neceſſariò: that is, Indirectly, and by chance; not directly and neceſſarily. Iudicia quippe Aſtrologorum ſunt media inter neceſſarium 
                  Lib. 8. contra Gentes c. 86. 
                  &amp; contingens: as Aquinas, ſpeaking of Ptolomy, hath reſolved it: The judgement that Aſtrologers give, is of a middle nature betwixt Neceſſity and Poſſibility. Otherwiſe it would utterly exclude the Freedome of the will, which the Pagans themſelves never denied, (in this point more moderate then ſome of our times:) who, though they had no other guide, then the dimme light of Nature, have yet confeſſed, that, Sapiens dominabitur Aſtris: 'Twas in the power of a wiſe man, to diſpoſe his Fate.
               And for this cauſe I reckon theſe Coeleſtiall Influences among the Externall Cauſes, which are not at any time the Neceſſary cauſes of a diſeaſe, but only when they are ſtrongly united, and meet with a Gal. 1. de Proc. c. 1. l.

                     ntrod. in Pulſ. &amp; l. de Teb. Body diſpoſed for the receaving of their vertue. The ſame is our opinion concerning the manifeſt qualities of the Aire:

                  aſcivious; which Countries have yet brought forth very worthy and famous men, that have farre ſurpaſſed for chaſtity, both the Scythians, Moſcovites, and Polonians.

                     Examples of rare vertue, &amp; great worth.
                  
               
               Now if the Aire have ſuch great power 
                     •
                  over our bodies, Meats and Drinks muſt needs have more. And theſe are of two ſorts; that is, either Hot, Flatuous, &amp; very Nutritive; or elſe ſuch as ingender Melancholy Humours: as we may gather out of Galen, towards the end of his laſt book de Loc. Aff. as we ſhall ſhew more at large in the Chapter, of the Prevention of Love: to the end, that thoſe that deſire to keep

themſelves free from this folly, or rather Madneſſe, may refraine from the uſe of them.
               Among the Externall and manifeſt cauſes of Melancholy, Idleneſſe may be accounted one of the chiefeſt: for as much as when a melancholy man is idle, he is at leaſure to entertain his own ſad Thoughts the better; and ſo by this meanes growes more Melancholy ſtill. For it is certaine, that all the Actions of the Minde, as Penſiveneſſe, and too much Thinking, doe dry up the Blood, and make it Melancholy. Beſides this, Idleneſſe is commonly the Mother of unchaſt Love, which for the moſt part takes its beginning and Birth among thoſe that are Idle, and have litle elſe to doe, but ſpend their time in painting, criſping, and curling themſelves, and courting their Looking-glaſſes: and cannot endure to thinke of any manner of labour or ſerious Imployment: as ſings the Comick Poet Menander.

               I may not ſhut up this Chapter, before I have delivered you the opinion of the Divine Plato, who under the perſon of In Sympoſ. 
                  Ariſtophanes tells a ſtory, how that at firſt there were Three kindes of Men, that is, Male, Female, and a third mixt species of the other two, called for that reaſon Androgynes: of whom there remaines nothing now, but the Infamy of their name. Their figure was round, having foure Hands, and as many Feet, with all the other members in proportion doubled. But conſpiring, as the Giants before had done againſt the Gods, Iupiter cauſed them to be divided in the midſt, as wee uſe to cut

Egges in two to ſowſe, or divide them in the midſt with haires: and then gave order to Apollo to turne their faces toward that part where the Diſſection was made; 
                     •
                  o the end that ſeeing their ſhame, they might become the more modeſt and temperate: and having ſo done, enjoyned him 
                     •
                  o heale up the wound agen. But after this, each one deſiring to recover his other 
                     •
                  alfe, they would runne one after the other, and embrace, deſiring, if it were poſſible, to be reunited. But when they found 
                     ••
                   could not be; they preſently periſhed for hunger, becauſe they would not doe any thing the one without the other. And when the one halfe failed, and the other remained behinde; that which was left, ſought for ſome other halfe, whether it were the Female halfe, or the Male: yet thus they came to ruine ſtill. But at length Iupiter being moved to compaſſion toward them, found out a meanes to help them, by tranſpoſing their Genitalls, which till then were behinde, and placing them, as now they are, before: and ſo contrived it, that they ſhould engender, the Male and Female together: for before

they conceaved and engendred as Graſhoppers doe, by caſting their ſeed on the ground. And ſo by this meanes was Mutuall Love begotten, as a Reconciler of their Ancient Nature, deſiring to maked Two, One, and a Remedy againſt Humane Frailty; which ſeemes to be nothing elſe but a ſtrong Deſire to be reunited &amp; made one againe.
               And it is not improbable that Ariſtotle alſo, and after him, (as Iul. Scaliger 
                  Lib. 2. de gen. anim. c. 1. thinks) Theophraſtus in his ſecond Booke of Plants, and firſt Chapter, favours this opinion of Plato, where hee ſaies, that the Male was divided from the Female, to the end he might the better apply himſelfe to the ſtudy of knowledge, &amp; other more noble Actions, then that of Generation: which thing could not bee done, otherwiſe, then by cutting of the privy Members belonging to the Female Sexe.
               It ſeemes that Plato, in his voyage that Euſeb. de Praep. Evang. c. 7. he made to Aegypt, ſucked this fabulous Opinion out of the miſinterpretation of ſome paſſages that he had met withall i
                     •
                   the books of Moſes, of which it is thought he had a view: for that Moſes in Geneſis
                  
ſeemes to ſay, that Adam was at firſt created Male and Female; and that afterward, the woman was taken out of his body, that ſo he might not be alone. From hence the Rabbins, Abraham, Hieremias, and Abraham Aben Eſra, would inferre, that Adam was created in two Perſons joyned together; the one part being Male, &amp; the other Female; which were afterward ſeparated by the Divine Power. But this Opinion of theirs hath been already ſo ſtrongly confuted by diverſe Learned Men, that have been very skilfull in the Hebrew tongue, that it would bee great Preſumption here in me to interpoſe. See what Ludovicus Regius in his Commentaries on Plato's Phoedrus hath collected concerning this point.
               But for my own part, I am of opinion, that the Ancient Heathen Divines, as we may call them, ſuch as Plato, of times couched the hidden Myſteries of their Religion under Figures, Hieroglyphicks, and Fables. Yet Marſilius Ficinus, following S. Auguſtine, ſaies, that, Non omnia quae in figuris finguntur, aliquid ſignificare putan
                     
                        •
                     da ſunt, &amp;c. We muſt not beleeve that all

things whatſoever the Heathen feigned have ſome private Myſticall meaning in them: for many things have been added, only for orders ſake, and Cohaerence with thoſe things that have been Significative. Yet without any diſparagement to Ficinus, or his Interpretation; I muſt be bold to affirme, that Plato by this fabulous diſcourſe would have us underſtand the Force of Love, which he before had proved to bee the moſt Powerfull of all the Gods: who, as a Mediator and Vmpire betwixt two that are divided, ſets them at one againe, by the tye of Marriage, and by the Conformity of their Wils, which in Lovers are united.

But our Phyſitians conclude more rightly, firſt, that Feare is the Perturbation or diſtemperature of the Minde, cauſed by the Apprehenſion of ſome evill, either Reall, or Apparant only: as Ariſtotle alſo affirmes, Rhetor. lib. 2. cap. 2. Secondly, that Sadneſſe is nothing elſe but a long continued Inveterate Feare, as Galen is o
                     •
                   opinion. Thirdly, that Feare, and Sadneſſe are the Pathognomicall ſignes of all kinds Lib. 4. de cauſ. pulſ. of Melancholy, neceſſarily attending this diſeaſe we now treat of, as we have already demonſtrated. And laſtly, that ſeeing that Feare and Sadneſſe are the Effects of an Imagination that is depraved, and the Characters of Love Melancholy; we may ſafely conclude, that it is cauſed, and hath its ſeat in the Braine, as well as the Imagination.
               But I ſhall rather hold with Mercurialis in this point, whoſe opinion is, that Lib. 1. met. c. 10. the Part Affected is ſometimes taken for the ſeat of the Diſeaſe it ſelfe; and ſometimes alſo for the ſeat of the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe. In the firſt Acception we maintaine, that in Love Melancholy the Braine is the part Affected: and the Heart, the

ſeat of the Cauſe only of the Diſeaſe; as in

Now theſe Corporeall Qualities which are derived from the Parents to the Children, are ſuch onely as are in the parts Informed in ſuch ſort, as that they have already contracted a Habitude. So that thoſe Properties and Qualities that depend of the Superior Faculties, and which are more noble then the Formative; as the Senſitive, Imaginative, &amp; Rationall; cannot poſſibly bee Hereditary: Otherwiſe a Learned Phyſitian ſhould neceſſarily beget a Sonne as learned in his Faculty as himſelfe, without any ſtudy a

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , in Habit, but ſome other alſo: for that we often finde Children to be ſubject to Agues, Pleuriſies, Catarrhes,

and the like, becauſe their Mothers had the ſame Diſeaſes, when they travailed with them.
               So that hence we may conclude, that thoſe Children that are begotten of ſuch Parents as have been ſo beſotted with Love, as that they have at length become Melancholy withall, are in danger of inheriting the ſame diſeaſe; unleſſe peradventure the Seed of one of the Parents corrected this fault in the other: or elſe it bee prevented by good Education, and Diſcipline. And it is alſo probable that thoſe that are Inclined to Love, through the Intemperature either of the whole Body, or elſe of the Principall parts; and not by the depravation of the Imaginative facultie, as the greateſt part of Lovers are, will beget Children ſubject to the ſame Diſcaſe.
            
            
               
               CAP. XI. The Different kindes of Love-Melancholy,
               
               I Shall not here reckon up all the ſeverall M. Equic. l. 3. 
                  Loves, Cupids, or Veneres, mentioned by Authors: Hee that deſires to ſee them, may have recourſe to Pauſanias, in Eliac. and Boeot. Plutarch in Erotic. Tully de Nat. Deor, and other prophane Authors. But my purpoſe in this place is, to ſhew you the different kindes of Paſſionate Love, or Erotique Melancholy, wherein ſometimes the Imagination only is depraved, and ſometimes both the Iudgement and Diſcourſe, together with the Imagination.
               
                  Galen, ſpeaking of this Diſeaſe, in diverſe Lib. 3. de loc. affect. c. 7. places of his workes, ſaith, that the Dotage of Melancholy perſons differeth, according as the Imagination is diverſly

affected; the which proceeds from the different Complexion of Bodies: for which reaſon, Aristotle in his Problems, and Anacreon in his Odes, compares them to drunken folkes. There are ſome ſo blinded with their unruly deſires, that they can love Hecuba as well as Helen, Therſites as Achilles. Others are ſo beſotted with this Paſſion, that they place their love on Inanimate and ſenſeleſſe things: as thoſe of whom Aelian, and Philoſtratus 
                  Lib. 6. c. 17. make mention, who were ſo deſperatly enamoured of a Marble Statue, that they died with the vere griefe they conceived, for that the Senate of Athens refuſed to ſell them thoſe Idols, they ſo much adored. Xerxes is reported to have been enamoured of a Tree: Alkidias the Rhodian of a Statue of Cupid of Praxiteles workmanſhip: Charicles of the Statue of 
                     Ʋenus: Narciſſus and Eutelides of their own Pictures. Notwithſtanding Ariſtotle 
                  Lib. 8. Eth c. 12. &amp; lib. 2. mag. mor. c. 11. in his Morals ſaies, that that Love which is borne to Inanimate Things, cannot properly be called Love, becauſe a a man cannot reciprocally be beloved by them agen: and becauſe one cannot deſire

in them that Good, wherein conſiſts the Eſſence of Love.
               And here omitting to ſpeake of the filthy brutiſh loves of Myrrha, Valeria, Tuſculanaria, Canace, Ariſtonymus, Fulvius, Tellus, Paſiphaë, Phaedra, Phillis, and others, of whom, as it is reported by Plutarch, Ovid, Aelian, and others, both Poëts and Hiſtorians, ſome have baſely luſted after their Fathers; Others, their Mothers, and Brothers; and ſome have doted even upon Beaſts: I ſhall onely diſcover to you the ſeverall Symptomes that diſtinguiſh Love-Melancholy into diverſe kinds or species. For we may obſerve, that Love is ſometimes attended on by Iealouſy, and ſometimes it is free from it: ſome Love is Furious, and ſometimes againe it is milde and Temperate. In like manner doth the diverſity of Regions and Climes much conduce to the diſtinguiſhing of the ſeverall kindes of Love. And therefore Hip. l. de aëre loc. &amp; aq. it is obſerved, that the Eaſterne People purſue their deſires, without either Moderation, or Diſcretion; yet in a kinde of baſe ſervile way. Thoſe that inhabit the more Southerne parts, love with Impatience,

Rage, and Fury: thoſe that inhabit the Weſterne Countries are very induſtrious in their Love: and the Northern are very ſlowly moved or touched with Love.
               The wily Italian in courting his Miſtreſſe, cunningly diſſembles his Love, and Equic. l. 4. de amor. c. 7. inſinuates himſelfe into her Favour by Pleaſant Diſcourſes, Sonnets, and Verſes, compoſed in her Praiſe: and if hee be ſo happy as to enjoy her, he is preſently jealous of her, and like a Priſoner, keeps her up under Lock and Key: but if he faile in his ſuit, hee then begins to hate her, as much, as before he loved her; and will not ſtick to doe her any miſchiefe that lies in his power.
               The eager and Impatient Spaniard, being once enflamed with theſe Deſires, runnes headlong on in his Love, &amp; without Intermiſſion followes his ſuit; and with moſt pitifull Lamentations Complaining of the Fire that conſumes him, Invocates and adores his Miſtreſſe. But when at length by any the moſt unlawful meanes he hath compaſſed his Deſires; he either growes jealous of her, and ſo perhaps

cuts her throat; or elſe baſely proſtitutes her for mony: But if hee cannot effect his purpoſe, he is then ready to run mad, or kill himſelfe.
               The Effeminate Frenchman endeavours to win his Miſtreſſes affection by faire honeſt meanes, entertaining her with Songs, and Pleaſant Diſcourſes. If hee chance to be jealous of her, hee tortures himſelfe extreamely, and weeps and laments his own unhappineſſe: But if ſhee chance to put a trick upon him, and deceave him at laſt; he then begins to brave it, and caſts opprobrious and injurious termes upon her, and ſometimes too falls to downe-right violence. And if he have once compaſſed his Deſires, and enjoyed her, he preſently neglects her, and begins to look after a new one.
               The German is of a Diſpoſition quite contrary to that of the Spaniard: for hee comes on in his Love by degrees, &amp; takes fire by litle and litle: And when hee is once Inflamed, he proceeds with Art and Iudgement, and endeavours to winne his Miſtreſſes favour by Gifts. If hee be once jealous of her, he with-drawes his Liberality:

if ſhe deceave him, he makes litle ſtirre about it; and if he ſpeeds in his ſuit, his love growes as ſoone cold againe.
               The French is given to flatter, and counterfeit Love: the German hides it: the Spaniard is apt to perſwade himſelfe that his Miſtreſſe loves him: and the Italian is continually tormented with Iealouſie.
               The French affects one that is witty &amp; pleaſant, though ſhe be not very faire: The Spaniard cares not how dull or heavy ſhe is, ſo ſhe be faire: the Italian would have her Modeſt and Fearefull: and the German, likes one that is ſomewhat hardy.
               So likewiſe in the purſuit of their Loves, the Frenchman, of a Wiſe-man, becomes a Foole: the German, after his ſlow onſet, having been held longin ſuſpence, of a Foole, becomes a Wiſe-man: the Spaniard hazards all for the enjoying of his Deſires: and the Italian deſpiſes all danger whatſoever.
               In Breife, the moſt certaine Differences of Love, are taken from the variety of the Complexions of thoſe that are affected

with this Malady. If a Sanguine man love Ficin in con. Plat. c. 9. orat. 7. one of the ſame complexion, this Love proves happy and full of delight. But if two Cholerick Perſons meet together, this is rather a ſlavery, then true Love, it Valler. obſ. 7. l. 2. 
                  
                     •
                  s ſo ſubject to Outrages and Anger, notwithſtanding the neereneſſe of their Cō
                  plexions. There is leſſe danger in the Love that happens betwixt a Cholerick perſon and a Sanguine: for theſe will bee ſometimes in, and ſometimes out. The Love that fals out betwixt a Melancholy and a Sanguine perſon, may bee happy enough, for here the ſweetneſſe of the Sanguine Diſpoſition will eaſily correct the untowardlineſſe of the Melancholy. But if this later chance to joyne with the Cholerick, it oft proves rather a Plague, then Love; and the end of it for the moſt part is Deſpaire: as it fell out to Lucrece, Dido, Phillis, and others above mentioned.
            
            
               
               CAP. XII. Whether that Diſeaſe in Women, called by Phyſitians, Furor Vterinus, be a Species of Love-Melancholy, or no.
               
               I Have obſerved among thoſe Writen that Diſcourſe of the Diſeaſes properly belonging to Women, five ſeverall kinds of Diſeaſes, very like each other, all proceeding from this one Malady of Love; &amp; they are theſe. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , Furor Matricis;

Now although it would not be much Impertinent to ſpeak of them all in ſeverall: yet to avoid Tediouſneſſe, I ſhall only handle the two later kinds; which differ only in Degree.

               You may ſee more, concerning the Nature of this Diſeaſe, in Hippocrates, in his Tract, De his quae ad Ʋirgin. spect, where he ſaies, that young Girles, when they now begin to be ready for Marriage, are apt to fall into a kinde of Melancholy, or Madneſſe, wherewith they are no ſooner taken, but preſently

                     •
                  ept from being their owne Murtherers.

The ſame is my Opinion alſo of thoſe women at Lions in France, that threw themſelves into Welles, thinking by this meanes to quench the heat of their burning deſires: as of old at Athens in a great plague, thoſe that were infected, ſeeking ſome meanes or other to mitigate the Torment they endured, caſt themſelues into Rivers, and Privies: as both Thucydides, and Lueretius have recorded.
               So that we may very ſafely conclude, that theſe two Diſeaſes, which we may with the Poët Euripides, call by a generall name, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , may as well be reckoned among the kindes of Love Melancholy, as the Satyriaſis in men; notwithſtanding that one of them beares the name of Fury, or Madneſſe: ſeeing that both Hippocrates and Galen doe often uſe the word Mania, for Melancholy, and ſo on the contrary: as we have before obſerved; and as may be collected alſo out of Avicen,

his Maſter into the Field, but might ſtay at home, and by this meanes have the fitter opportunity to enjoy his Miſtreſſe. And in his book de Praecog. he relates the manner, how he diſcovered the Love of Iuſtus his wife, who was enamoured of one Pylades: and that, meerely by feeling her pulſe very hard, and obſerving withall her countenance, as he named him to her.

                  An Amoriſt deſcry.
                  For in his Breaſt's a ſigne,
                  By which I can divine.
               
               For as ſoone as ever Cupid hath kindled this fire within their Hearts, they are conſtrained preſently to lay open their Breaſts, and cry out for helpe. The heate of theſe flames oftimes diſcovers it ſelfe in the Cheekes, where it preſents the beholders eye with as many various colours, as the Rainebow weares.
               
                  
                     —Benè quis celaverit Ignem?
                     Lumine nam ſemper proditur ipſe ſuo.
                     Quod licet, ut poſſum, conor celare pudorē;
                     Attamen apparet diſſimulatus Amor.
                  
                  
                     Who's he, that can hide fire? whoſe brighter Raies,
                     The more reſtrain'd, the more themſelves betray.
                     
                        
Nor can Love be by any art ſuppreſt,
                     Where each Bluſh tells the ſecrets of the Breaſt.
                  
               
               And for this cauſe Diotimus in Plato's Conviv, ſaies, that Love inherits this from his mother Penia, to be alwaies 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , naked, and without a covering. And for this cauſe the Poets alſo alwaies feigne him to be naked, becauſe, as Eraſmus in his Adagies obſerves, Love cannot be covered. For, not the eyes alone, but even the tongue alſo, and the cheekes themſelves by their Bluſhes will neceſſarily diſcover it. Yet notwithſtanding all theſe manifeſt ſignes of Love, together with their frequent ſighings, continuall complaints, Importunate praiſes of their Miſtreſſes, and the like: the Lover ſtill beleeves his deſires are ſo cloſely carried, as that the quickeſt apprehenſion cannot diſcover them: whereas indeed they lye open, and expoſed to every eye.
               I ſhall willingly grant, that it is not ſo eaſy a matter to diſcover the Love of one that is but lightly touched with it. But if the party be but ſo farre entred into

it, as that Melancholy, or Love-Madneſſe now begins to ſeize on him: I dare undertake to finde out ſuch a ones diſeaſe,

                  t is already ſetled, but alſo where there is but a bare Inclination unto it only in the Conſtitution. And herein I ſhall be forced to crave aſſiſtance from all faculties, and ſometimes too, as Galen ſaies, we muſt be content to helpe our ſelves with bare conjectures: as he him ſelfe was once faine to doe, when he diſcovered the deceit of a Knight in Rome, that feigned himſelfe to be troubled with the colicke, that ſo he might avoid being preſent at a generall Aſſembly of the Citizens. Notwithſtanding, as he there obſerves, this

diſcovery was not properly of Medicinall Cognition; but rather belonged to the power of Reaſon and Common Senſe: which, although it be common to all, yet is it exact and Ripe in a very few. And therefore he concludes, that where this naturall faculty is ſound, and joyned in commiſſion, as it were, with Medicinall experience, that man ſhall be able to make any the like diſcoveries as theſe.

                     Love can't lye hid: his torch, within the Heart
                     Once kindled, ſtraight inflames each other part.
                     A gentle ſweat bedewes the Limbes; the eye
                     Betraies its heat: the cheekes warme bluſhes dye.
                  
               
               To this we may adde their exceſſive talking,

which proceeds from the fulneſſe of their Heart. For Love, ſaies Plutarch, is naturally a great Babler, eſpecially when Symp. l. 2. qu. 5. it chanceth to light upon the commendation of thoſe things that are its objects. For that Lovers have a ſtrong deſire to enduce all others to the beliefe of that, whereof themſelves are already perſwaded: which is, that they love nothing, but what is abſolutely perfect, both for Goodneſſe, Beauty and Profit: and they would willingly have theſe opinions of theirs confirmed alſo by all other mens judgements. This is that which moved Candaules to bring Gyges into his bed-chamber, and there to let him have a perfect view of the naked Beauties of his Wife. Vnleſſe you will rather ſay, that the Reaſon that thoſe that are in Love, talke ſo much, is, to exerciſe their Perſwaſive Faculty, that ſo by this means they may render themſelves the more worthy of their Miſtreſſes Love.

found, (ſaies he, Lib. de Cogn. &amp; Cur. morb. Anim. and cap. 6. de Praecogn. ad Poſthem.) That ſhe had neither Fever, nor any other Corporall Diſeaſe; ſo that I preſently conjectured that ſhee was in Love. And

all in Love, but only by Sympathy.
               Yet I deny not, but that by the Pulſe it is poſſible to know a Paſſionate Lover, by reaſon of the ſtirring of the Spirits: for which cauſe, Avicen ſaies, that if one Lib. 3. fen. 1. tr. 4. c. 23 would know the name of ſuch a ones Miſtreſſe, he muſt feele his Pulſe, and at the ſame inſtant name the Party whom hee ſuſpects to be the cauſe of his Malady, &amp; take ſome occaſion or other to commend her Beauty, ſweetneſſe of Behaviour, Parentage, Attire, or Qualities of Mind: for at the ſame time, Pulſus diverſificabitur in varietate magnâ, &amp; fiet ſimilis Interſecto; you ſhall perceave, ſaith he, a ſtrange alteration in the Motion of the Pulſe, and it will be very unequall, and often interrupted.

                  Chriſtophorus à Ʋega addes to theſe Signes here ſet downe, another, which in my opinion ſeemes to bee of litle or no moment: and that is, that thoſe that are in Love, will not eat Grapes; becauſe that this kinde of fruit filleth the Stomack and Belly with Winde, and this Inflation

oppreſſing the Midriffe, and hindering the motion of the Heart, diſturbeth Reſpiration, and ſuffers them not to ſigh at their pleaſure.
               By the greater part of theſe Signes, when I firſt began to practiſe in this Faculty at Agen, the place of my birth, in the yeare 1604. I diſcovered the fooliſh doatings of a young Schollar of that City, who was deſperatly gone in Love, and made his complaint unto mee, that notwithſtanding all the Medicines that had been preſcribed him by the Phyſitians of that place, and a certaine Paracelſian Mountebanke that he had met withall, he could neither enjoy his ſleep, nor take delight in any thing in the world; but was ſo full of diſcontent, that he was faine to retire from Toloſe to Agen, hoping by this change of Aire to finde ſome mitigation of his griefe: where as, contrary to his Expectation, he found himſelfe in a farre worſe ſtate then before. When I conſidered his relation, and withall ſaw him to be a young Man, and affected with theſe Griefes and Diſcontents without any Cauſe, whom but a litle before I had

knowne Ioviall and merry: and perceaved withall his Countenance to be grown pale, yellowiſh, and of a ſad decaied colour; his eyes hollow; and all the reſt of Body in reaſonable good plight: I began to ſuſpect it was ſome Paſſion of the Minde that thus tormented him: &amp; then conſidering his Age, and his Complexion, which was ſanguine, and his Profeſſion; I certainely concluded that his Diſeaſe was Love. And as I was urgent upon him to let me knowe the Externall cauſe of his Malady, there comes by chance a handſome ſervant-maid of the Houſe about ſome buſineſſe or other into the Roome where we were, and was the meanes of diſcovering the true ground of his Diſeaſe. For ſhe coming in at the inſtant as I was feeling his Pulſe, I perceaved it ſuddenly vary its motion, and beat very unequally; he preſently grew pale, and Bluſhed againe in a moment, and could hardly ſpeake. At the laſt ſeeing himſelfe as it were taken tardy, he plainely confeſt the true Cauſe of this his diſtemper; but withall refuſed to admit of any other Cure but from her that had given him his

Wound: and therefore intreated mee to deſire the Mother of the Damſell to give 
                     •
                  er conſent that hee might marry her; preſuming that his Father, notwithſtanding ſhe was no fit match for him, would not deny him that Contentment, on which his Life and ſafety depended; oftentimes repeating that Verſe out of Propertius.
               
               
                  
                     Neſcit Amor priſcis cedere Imaginibus.

                  To Swelling Titles, Blood, or Race.
               
               But this Marriage could not bee effected: the young Man in the meane time grows worſe and worſe in a deſperate manner, till at length a Fever ſeazes on him, together with a violent ſpitting of Blood. This amazes him; and ſeeing no other meanes of ſafety, he is at length perſwaded to follow my Directions: and ſo by ſuch Phyſick as I preſcribed him, he was at length perfectly cured of his Malady.
               A like ſtory to this may you read in Obſer. 7. l. 2. 
                  Valleriola, of a Cure wrought by himſelfe upon a Merchant of Arles, who had continued

for the ſpace of ſix Moneths diſtracted with Love: and had he not been prevented by the care of his Parents, hee had killed himſelfe.
               But what need we trouble our ſelves to ſeek ſo farre for Examples of this kind, ſeeing that there is hardly a Diſeaſe more frequent in our Eyes then this of Love, if we are able but to diſtinguiſh betwixt it, and the other kindes of Melancholy; as Madneſſe, and the Suffocation of the Matrix: with which Diſeaſes, this of Love hath great Affinity.
            
            
               CAP. XV. The Cauſe of Paleneſſe in Lovers.
               
               THE Paleneſſe of the Colour, is a thing ſo Proper to thoſe that are deeply in Love, that Diogenes, one day meeting a young Man that looked very pale, gueſſed him to be either a very Envious perſon, or elſe that he was in Love:

according to that of the Poet.
               Palleat omnis Amans: Color hic eſt aptus Amanti.
               It is the proper Colour &amp; Badge of Love. But by the way it is to be noted, that we muſt not underſtand by this word Pale, a ſimple Decoloration, or whiteneſſe of Probl. 4. ſect. 38. the Skin, which, as the Philoſopher ſaies, is, as it were, a kinde of Putrefaction of the skin: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   But rather a mixt Colour of White, &amp; Yellow; or of White, Yellow, &amp; Green: which Hippocrates calls 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , Plutarch, and Lucretius, 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ; and all Greeke Writers, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , or 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . For theſe words doe not ſignify a bare Green; but alſo a pale Colour, and ſuch a one, as appeares to be in Corne, when as Immoderate Heat, and a Southerne wind hath ripened it too ſoone: as we may eaſily collect from that Con. 3. in 6. Epid. place of Galen, where, ſpeaking of the Aſians, he ſaies, that, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  .

When they ſee any looke pale, they preſently aske, what's the reaſon they looke ſo 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , Greene; making no difference at all betwixt theſe two words, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , pale; and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , greene. Now, (ſaies the ſame Author,) this pale colour is ſuch, as we ſee in Fire, &amp; Ocre, or Orpiment: and is cauſed in the body by the Permixtion of yellow choler with the thin wateriſh parts of the Blood. Which opinion of his is alſo confirmed by Phavorinus, who will have this word 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   to be derived from 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , by adding 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   after 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and tranſlating 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  .
               Whence we perceave how groſſely Ruellius is miſtaken, on the 78. chapter of Dioſcorides, where he very confidently denies, that we have the true Myrrhe, becauſe it is not Green: ſuppoſing that 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   ſignifies only greene, and not yellowiſh; or rather ſuch a colour, as appears to be in Hearbes that are dried, in Lib. de intern. aff. Aret. l. 1. de cauſ. &amp; ſign. morb. Chrom. c. 13. Lentils, and in the dried pills of Pomegranats: And therefore Hippocrates oftentimes calls ſuch pale folkes, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , which being cauſed by reaſon of the great abundance of yellow Choler, mixt with the crude Humors, and diſperſed all over the body, it infecteth with its colour the skinne, which according to our Phyſitians, is To

                  ; ſaith Hippocrates; The colour of the Humours, unleſſe they retire into the moſt inward parts of the Body, appeares evidently in the skinne: but chiefely in the Face, becauſe that the skinne of that part is more thin and fine, then of any other part; and therefore the more apt to receive

the tincture of the Putrified Humours. But if by chance any ſmall portion of Melancholy be mixed with the Cholericke Humour, the party then becomes of a kind of tawny colour, or a darke green: which colour Plutarch and Aretaeus expreſſe very aptly by the word, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

               CAP. XVI. What manner of eyes Melancholy Lovers have.
               
               THere is no part of the whole Body whatſoever that ſooner diſcovers the Indiſpoſition of the Body then the Eyes; according to the doctrine of Hippocrates: 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : looke in Lib. 6. Epid. ſect. 4. Aph. 26. what ſtate the eyes are, in the ſame is the reſt of the Body. A manifeſt experience whereof we have in our Lovers, who according as Avicen, P. Aegineta, Oribaſius, Haly Abbas, and Alſaravius, obſerve,

have their eyes hollow, and ſunke into their head, dry, and without teares; yet alwaies twinkling with a kind of ſmiling 
                     •
                  ooke. This hollowneſſe of the eyes, which Alexander Aphrodiſaeus calls 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and Rufus Epheſius 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , proceeds, as Stephanus Athen. ſaith, from Gorreus. Merc. in Progn. Hippocr. Foeſius in Hipp. the Imbecility of the naturall Heat, and the Diſſipation of the ſpirits, which doe abound in the eyes: or elſe by the malignity and ill temper of the Humours: or laſtly by a conſumption.
               Yet we may obſerve great contrariety of opinion among theſe Authors: For Avicen, Oribaſius, and Alſaravius affirme, that thoſe that are ſick of Love-Melancholy, are leane generally throughout the whole Body, as well by reaſon they eate and drinke very little, as alſo for that their Digeſtion is very bad, by reaſon that the ſpirits and Naturall Heat are withdrawne from the ſtomacke, to the Braine. And yet theſe above named Authors ſay, that, Oculi ſoli non concidunt; it is not the eyes alone, that ſuffer in this diſeaſe: whereas P. Aegineta maintaines the quite contrary opinion, ſaying, that

                  caeteris partibus corporis illaeſis, nullâ
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      calamitate collabentibus, ſoli illi Amatoribut concidunt: All the other parts of the Body continuing in a good and perfect ſtate of Health, the Eyes only in Love-Melancholy are ill affected.
               
                  Chriſtophorus à Vega, willing to excuſe Lib. 3. de Art. med. c. de Amor. 
                  Aegineta, ſaies that he underſtands by Collapſus, in this place, ſegnem motum &amp; Deſidentiam, a kind of dull heavy motion of the eyes. But I conceive this expoſition to be ſomewhat forced: for as much as the ſame Author aſſents, with all the other above mentioned, that thoſe perſons that are in Love, have a continuall motion or winking with their eye-lids, ſemper conniventes: which motion Hippocrates in his Epidemicks calls, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . And Galen alſo ſeems to mee to favour this opinion of Oribaſius and Avicen, when he ſaies in his ſecond booke de Criſibus, that Hollow Eyes and a Pale colour are the evident and true ſignes of thoſe that are oppreſſed with ſadneſſe, and other like paſſions.
               But theſe Authors in my opinion, may be reconciled, by ſaying, that Avicen and

                  Oribaſius ſpeake more conſonantly both to Reaſon and Experience, if they be underſtood of Paſſionate Love, which is now already growne to a degree of Madneſſe. For ſo the Divine Plato alſo in his Feaſt affirmes, that Love is, of his owne Nature, and alſo by the Hereditary Imperfection of his Mother Penia, alwaies Hard, Dry, Leane, and loathſome, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : becauſe that by reaſon of too much 
                     •
                  ntention of the mind, penſiveneſſe and Anxiety, the Lover looſeth the fulneſſe of fleſh and good likeing of his Body, that 
                     •
                  he before enjoyed. Which, when Aegi
                     
                        •
                     eta denies, he is to be underſtood not of thoſe that are farre gone in this Diſeaſe, but only newly entred into it. This explication for the reconciling of the contrariety of theſe Doctors opinions, if it diſpleaſe any man, I ſhall expect a better from him.
            
            
               
               CAP. XVII. Whether Teares be Symptomes of Love, or no.
               
               
                  HIppocrates in his Epidemicks makes Aph. 17. Sect. 1. 1. 6. Teares to be of two ſorts, Voluntary and Involuntary. The laſt of which kinds is cauſed by reaſon of the weakeneſſe of the Retentive Facultie in the Braine, which hath been debilitated either by ſome Diſeaſe, or by the great Abundance of moiſture, contracted within the Head: or elſe becauſe the expulſive Faculty of the Braine is provoked by the ſharpneſſe of the Humours in the Braine, or by the vapours that are exhaled from the inferior parts; as it is often ſeen in thoſe that are ſick of an Ague: or laſtly by reaſon of ſome particular diſtemper of the eyes, as Exulceration, Fiſtula, Opthalmy, Running of the eyes, or the like, as alſo by Smoake,

Duſt, or other like externall cauſes.
               As concerning voluntary Teares, it was the Opinion of Empedocles long ſince, that when any one was ſurcharged with any ſtrong paſſion of the Mind, the Blood was troubled, and from thence followed Teares, in like manner as whey comes from Milke. Alexander Aphrodiſaeus is of opinion, that the Melancholy Humour having ſhut up and encompaſſed the Heart; the Humidity endeavours to ſhew it ſelfe, where it findes the freeſt paſſage.
               But we ſay, that the materiall cauſe of Teares, is the ſame with that of Spittle; which is, the Abundance of ſeroſity remaining in the Braine, after the third concoction: by reaſon whereof old men, women, and young children, are more inclined to weeping, then any other.
               Now this moyſture flowes from the eyes, either by reaſon of the compreſſion of the Braine, during the time of ſadneſſe: or elſe by the Dilatation of it; as we often ſee it comes to paſſe in thoſe that are charged with ſome ſuddaine great joy, or elſe 
                     •
                  augh extreamely. For as much then as

Lovers are ſubject to all theſe paſſions, Avic. Arnald. of Ioy, Laughter and Sadneſſe: it is evident that they are not Involuntary Teares that fall from Lovers eyes, which, as we have already ſhewed, are generally dry and void of Teares, but only the Voluntary, as when they either doubt, or elſe deſpaire of their Miſtreſſes favour. And hence it is that we ſhall obſerve Poëts ſo often repreſenting unto us Lovers weeping and lamenting: Becauſe that Love is alſo delighted in Teares, according to the Poet.
               Nonnihil aſperſis gaudet Amor Lachrymis. Propert. l. 1. Eleg, 11.
               
               Yet will I not therefore preſently conclude, that this ſigne is Pathognomicall, nor ſcarcely Certaine; eſpecially in women, who as the Poet ſaies,
               Quóve volunt plorant tempore, quóvt modo.
               Have the command of their Teares, and can weepe, when, and how they pleaſe.
            
            
               
               CHAP. XVIII. The cauſes of Waking, and Sighes in Lovers.
               
               THe cauſes of thoſe continuall wakings Arnald. c. de Amor. Gordon. de Am. which oppreſſe Lovers, making them more Melancholy, ſad, leane, and Dry,
               (Attenuant Iuvenum vigilatae corpora noctes.)
               Are, the diverſe Imaginations and Fancies that ſteale into the Braine, and never ſuffer them to take any quiet repoſe: whence the Braine becomes Dry and Cold; Beſides that from the naturall Melancholy, which is naturally Cold, and as dry as duſt, there cannot be exhaled any ſweet and gentle vapours, which by their moiſture ſhould looſen the nerves, and diſcharging them of their office, may ſo

cauſe withall a ceſſation of all ſenſe and motion.
               And if by chance they be ſurpriſed by any light ſlumber, which is the proviſion Nature hath made for the repairing of the Animall ſpirits, which in them are waſted and much impaired, by the violence of their Imagination, and exceſſive wakings: that ſlumber is attended on by a thouſand Phantaſmes, and fearefull dreames; ſo that they awake oftimes more diſcontented, ſad, penſive, melancholy, and fearefull, then before; and for the moſt part they find themſelves more tormented ſleeping, then waking.
               Sighing is cauſed in Melancholy Lovers, by reaſon that they many times forget to draw their breath, being wholy taken up with the ſtrong Imaginations that they have, either in beholding the beauty of their Loves, or elſe, in their Abſence, contemplating on their rare perfections, and contriving the meanes how to compaſſe their Deſires. So that at length recollecting themſelves, Nature is conſtrained to draw as much Aire at once, as before it ſhould have done at two or three

times. And ſuch a Reſpiration is called, a Sigh; which is indeed nothing elſe, but, a doubled Reſpiration.
            
            
               CAP. XIX. During what age men and women are ſubject to this diſeaſe of Love-Melancholy.
               
               NOtwithſtanding that Democritus, as Epiſt. ad Demag. 
                  Hippocrates hath reported him, ſaies, that all Mankind from their very birth are ſubject not only to Diſeaſes in generall, but even to this of love alſo in particular: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Yet can it not be denied, but that ſome diſeaſes are more appropriate to certaine ages, and ſeaſons, then others are, as the ſame Authour affirmes, Aphor. 19. lib. 3. And in his Praedict. Coac. he definitively ſets downe the limits of time, wherein a man is ſubject to all kind of diſeaſes, to be, betwixt the age of fourteen yeares, and forty

two: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . It remaines therefore that we examine, whether or no, a man is not ſubject to this malady of Love, without the compaſſe of theſe yeares.
               Love being, as Plato ſaies, a ſtrong deſire of generation: of neceſſity, ſo long as a man is able to performe the Act of Generation, ſo long he is alſo ſubject to Love, and (if he reſtraine not his deſires within the bounds of Reaſon,) to Love. Melancholy alſo. Now ſome Authours affirme, that a man is able to engender at nine, or ten yeares of age: and they goe about to confirme this their Aſſertion, by the examples of King Solomon, and Achaz, who had children, when they were but ten, or eleaven yeares old, at the moſt: which S. Gregory, S. Hierome, and Albertus Roſarius affirme that themſelves have knowne by experience in ſome others. And, (which ſeemes a thing incredible,) Pliny reports, that among the Indians, the Plin. l. 7. c. 2 
                  Mandri and Calingi have children at five, or ſix yeares of age.
               But on the contrary, ſome againe there

are, that would deprive men of this power, ſo long as they are under the age of Caeſ. 6 de Bel. Gal. twenty: and for this cauſe the Germans forbid carnall copulation to young folke, before they have attained unto the age of twenty yeares.
               But the moſt received opinion is, that men and women are ſubject to this diſeaſe of Love-Melancholy, as ſoone as ever they are entred into thoſe yeares, in which they begin Pubeſcere, to come to their Puberty: which appeares in men chiefly by their voice, which at that time growes greater and harſh withall, and in women it may be knowne by obſerving their breaſts, which about this time begin to ſwell and grow bigger, and that for the moſt part, about the age of twelve, or Fourteene: And this is now the generall Rule, by which their Puberty is knowne, Jndagatione corporis inhonestâ ceſſante;

               And as concerning thoſe Inſtances of K. Solomon, and Achaz, above mentioned, we anſwer, that though perhaps it be granted that they are true; yet are they

very rare, and ſcarcely to be paralleld: and that ſuch perſons being for the moſt part, very ſhort-lived, (for Solomon lived not above fifty yeares:) it ſeemes in a manner neceſſary, that their Puberty ſhould be earlier in them, then in other men: it being the Iuſtice of Nature, that thoſe Creatures that muſt ſoone meet their Period, ſhould as ſuddenly arrive to their Perfection and Maturity: as we may obſerve in women, who, according to Aristotle, 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , as they are ripe ſooner then men, ſo doe they commonly faile before them.
               Now as youth, or Puberty opens the way to Love; ſo in like manner doth old age ſhut it up. Which Solon finding in himſelfe, be gave the Gods great thankes for ſending him ſo great a bleſſing as old age was; wherein he enjoyed more contentment and pleaſure, by being freed from his former youthfull Amorous heats, then he felt diſcommodity or trouble in Pol. l. 4. c. 16. &amp; l. 5. de Hiſt. Anim. c. 14, &amp; l. 7. c. 6. his old age.
               
                  Ariſtotle ſaies, that it is about the age of threeſcore and ten, that old men begin to be out of Cupids reach, and bid Defiance

to Venus. And therefore the Emperour Tiberius thought thoſe men worthy to be puniſhed that at theſe yeares were not able to governe their deſires, but ſuffered themſelves to bee overcome by this youthfull Paſſion of Love: and to this purpoſe enacted the Law called Papia Poppaea, for the reſtraining of this Abuſe. And to this the Poet Gallus ſeemes to allude, when he thus breakes out into an Exclamation.
               O miſeri, quorum gaudia crimen habent.
               How miſerable is the condition of Mankind, when as their very pleaſures are numbred out unto them by their Puniſhments?
               But Avenzoar confutes Ariſtotles opinion Lib. 2. tr. 3. c. 1. by many forcible Arguments; which for brevity's ſake I ſhall omit: only adding in confirmation hereof, the examples of King Maſiniſſa, who got a child when Plin. l. 7. c, 14. he was foureſcore yeare old: and Cato the Cenſor, who did the like at threeſcore and fifteene. Our Hiſtorians goe yet farther, and report for certaine, that 
                     Ʋladiſlaus,
                  
King of Polonia, had two ſonnes, when he was foureſcore and twelve, or thereabout. And Felix Platerus in his Medic. Obſervat. ſaies, that his Father had a Daughter at foureſcore: and his Fathers great Grand-father had a ſonne after he was a hundred yeares old.
               I grant that in the greateſt part of old men, after they are once threeſcore, all their deſires, (excepting that of Covetouſneſſe,) are 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , as Plutarch expreſſeth it, Toothleſſe: yet will we not exempt them wholly from this diſeaſe of Love. For beſides thoſe examples already alleadged; we read, that Theſeus was above threeſcore yeares old, when he was ſo enamoured of the beauteous Helen, that he raviſhed her. And we are taught by daily experience, that the Emperour Claudius, who ſucceeded in the Empire the next but one to Tiberius, not without very juſt cauſe abrogated the Poppaean Law.

For Enripides ſaies, that Venus is diſpleaſed with old men: And for this cauſe the Heathens, (at Plutarch reports) accounted thoſe Marriages that were celebrated in the moneth of May, Diſaſterous, and ominous; as ſome ſuperſtitious Chriſtians alſo doe at this day: becauſe that Venus hated this moneth, as being conſecrated to the honour of old age.
               
                  Lacydes, King of the Argians, was knowne to be in love, by his over curious trimming and curling of his haire: as was Pompey the great alſo, by the nice ſcratching of his head with one finger.

And indeed we ſee commonly that the Germans are great Drinkers, the Spaniards proud, the Engliſh deceitfull, the French unconſtant, the Athenians witty, the Thracians dull, the Sarmatians Chaſt but the Neopolitans, Aſians, Africans, and Aegyptians, very laſcivious and addicted to Venery.

                  Niceph. l. 17. c. 32. reports it, was able by certaine ſignes to give notice of ſuch perſons as were any way touched with unchaſt deſires? Or the Bird Porphyrion, mentioned by Dupreau, in Anno 563, that would make as though ſhe would ſtrangle her ſelfe, if ſhe but perceived an Amorous or an adulterous perſon within her Maſters houſe? Or to the Water of Triall, uſed by the ancient Hebrewes, for to prove whether P. Belon. a married woman had been diſhoneſt or no: Of which water an unchaſt woman had no ſooner taſted, but ſhe began preſently to be very dry; whereas on the contrary, if the ſuſpicion were unjuſt, ſhe thereby recovered a more perfect ſtate of

What ſhall we ſay (I ſay) to all theſe, but only that God hath given to many things ſuch hidden qualities, as that the moſt learned Philoſopher can render no ſound evident reaſon of them.

                     We ſcarcely know the things before our eyes.
                     So darke, and hidden are truths Myſteries.
                  
               
               It is much more eaſy to ſhew a reaſon Lemni. de occul. nat. mir. c. 30. of the diſcovering of unchaſt perſons by the ſtones in their Rings, or other Iewels: which are thought to change their colour, and become obſcure, darke, and pale, by reaſon of thoſe vapours, that ariſe from the unchaſt luſtfull bodies of thoſe that weare them: an experience whereof I my ſelfe have ſeen in the Eranos, or Turquois ſtone.

               The Genethliacall Aſtrologers have other ſignes, more ſubtle, though perhaps not much more certaine; which they take Iul. Firm.
                  
from the Horoſcope. They ſay, that if one be borne when Mars and Venus are in conjunction, he will undoubtedly be inclined to Love and Erotique Melancholy; but perhaps much to his owne dammage. For if the Sunne riſe, under the Conjunction of theſe two Planets, he will not be
               Felicior Aſtro Martis; ut in laqueos non incidat.
               
                  Ariſtotle, in his Politicks, will have the Pol. l. 2. c. 9. meaning of this to be, that Martialiſts, and men of warre, are eaſily taken Priſoners by Cupid: 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : All theſe kind of men (ſaith he,) are very prone to Venery. And the Phyſitians ſay, that the Aſtrologers, by Venus, underſtand Phlegme, or rather Blood; and by Mars, Choler: For Mars is hot and dry; and Venus moiſt: which two Complexions, being met together, Ficin. c. 9. orat. 7. in conv. Plat. Franc. Valler. Obſerv. 7. l. 2. Equi. c. 2. l. 4. denat. Amor. doe make the perſons enclined to mutuall Love. The ſame judgement doe they give of him that is borne, when Venus is in Leo; or when the Moon, and Venus doe mutually aſpect each other: or elſe when Iupiter
                  
is in a Trine, or Sextile aſpect with the Sunne, or Mercury; eſpecially if it happen on the ſecond, or fifteenth day of the Moon
               But there is no great heed to be taken, what theſe men ſay, who are for the moſt part (in the opinion of S. Augustin) meere S. Aug. confel. l. 7. c. 6 &amp; l. 2. de Doctr. chriſt. c. 21 Cheaters and Impoſtors: as you may ſee proved at large by Ioan. Picus Mirandula, in his 12 bookes that he hath written againſt Iudiciary Aſtrologers, being moved thereto, becauſe that one of them, named Bulanus, had caſt his Nativity, and Cardan. Aph. 63. Segm. 1. Aph. Aſtro. told him that he ſhould live but 34 yeares: which indeed afterwards fell out accordingly. In which bookes of his, he ſeemes to have comprehended all that can be ſaid againſt theſe Fumi venditores: and he hath alſo been ſeconded by his Nephew Franciſcus Io: Picus, in his Iul.

               Nevertheleſſe, ſeeing that Galen, the Prince of Rationall Phyſitians, Lib. 3. de Dieb. Decret. cap. 5. &amp; 6. ſeemes to attribute great vertue to the Influences of the Planets over ſublunary bodies, and divides

them, as the Aſtrologers doe, into Influences Benigne, &amp; Maligne. And becauſe that many endeavour to prove, that no man can be a good Phyſitian, without the knowledge of Genethliacall Aſtrology, which, they ſay, is grounded on experience, as Phyſicke is; and hath its Aphoriſmes, as certaine, as any our Faculty hath: And on the other ſide againe, there are ſome that over-ſuperſtitiouſly abhorre the very name of an Aſtrologer; accounting them to be meere Magitians and Conjurers: I thinke it fit ſo farre to juſtify this Art, as to ſhew the certainty and profit of it, which I ſhall doe in the enſueing Chapter, and withall ſhall ſhew, what uſe it hath in Phyſicke: ſince that Hippocrates ſaies, that Phyſick and Aſtronomy are ſiſters, and Both daughters of one and the ſame Father, Apollo.

               AStrology, as it is defined by ſome Philoſophers, is a Part of Naturall Ariſt. 1. Phyſ. c. 2. Fonſec. 2. Met. c. 3. q. 3. Philoſophy, diſcourſing of the Starres and their motion and Influences: and was found out at firſt by one Actinus, who Pol. Virg. de Invent. l. 17. c. 17. S. Aug. l. 18. de Civ. Dei. for this cauſe was ſurnamed, Solis Filius: or elſe, as ſome others will have it, by Mercury; or his Grandfather Atlas, who, for this reaſon, is fained by the Poets to beare up the Heavens with his ſhoulders. Servius, on the ſixth of Virgils Eclogues, 
                  Plin. l. 1. c. 15. &amp; 16. Diod. Sicul. l. 4. attributes the glory of this Invention to Promerheus; Pliny, to the Phoenicians; or elſe to Iupiter Belus: and Diodorus Siculus, to the Aegyptians; who were firſt inſtructed in this ſcience, by the Patriarch Abraham, (as Ioſephus in his Iewiſh Antiquities

affirmes:) who, by conſidering the glory and beauty of the Heavens, 
                     ••
                   richly adorned and beſpangled with ſo in numerable a company of ſtarres, was ſtirred up to the Contemplation alſo of the Divine power and goodneſſe and Providence: as afterwards, in imitation of him diverſe other Philoſophers alſo have been. For Aſtrology, ſaith Plato in Timaeo, &amp; in Legib. recalls the minds of men Procl

               It is commonly divided into Aſtronomy, Pet. de Alliac. in conc. Theol. &amp; Aſtron. or Theoreticall Aſtrology; and Iudiciary, Prognoſticall, Conjecturall Aſtrology, or Practicall Aſtronomy: which is againe of Three Sorts. The firſt is that which foretells the changes and viciſſitudes of things; as Raine, Floods, Winds, Faire-weather, Drouth, Peſtilence, health, death, peace, warre &amp; the like. The

                  Iohn Taxil, a French writer, being very much offended with a certaine ſcrupulous Bigot, that had taxed him of errour and impiety in his Cometology; hath put forth a learned tract of Aſtronomy, which he dedicates to Mſieua 
                  du Vair: where he proves out of Thomas Aquinas. that as a Phyſitian can judge of the Goodneſſe of Aquin. l. 3. cont. gent. c. 54. 84. &amp; 86. the underſtanding, by the Complexion and Temperature of the Braine, as by the Immediate cauſe: In like manner may an Aſtrologer, by meanes of the Caeleſtiall

               CHAP. XXII. Whether, or no, by Phyſiognomy, and Chiromanyc, a man may know one to be Jnclined to Love.
               
               
                  GAlen, relying upon the Authority of Lib. de cub. aegror. 
                  Hippocrates, affirmes, that thoſe men that take upon them to profeſſe the Art of Phyſicke, without the perfect knowledge of Phyſiognomy, are as it were in

perpetuall darkneſſe, and commit many groſſe Abſurdities &amp; Errors: For as much as Phyſiognomy is a part of Semioticall Medicine, which the Naturaliſts divided into Metopoſcopy, Chiromancy, and Particular Phyſiognomy. Now of all theſe kinds, the firſt is the moſt certaine, becauſe that the Face is, as it were, the Epitome, Index, and picture of the ſoule, repreſenting by its diverſe Characters and extract of all the Titles of its Nobleneſſe: And is therefore placed in the Frontiſpice of this Fabricke of our body, to the end it may be knowne, that there ſhe keeps her Court, and chiefeſt Reſidence. Animi eſt omnis actio: &amp; Imago Animi vultus eſt. The Soule is the Original cauſe and Principle of all our motions and actions: and the Face is the Image of the ſoule. Indices

                  oculi, ſaith Tully, quos Natura dedit, ut Equo, &amp; Leoni ſet as, caudam, Aures, ad motus declarandos. And therefore Alexanander Aphrodiſaeus calls the eyes, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , the looking-glaſſes of the ſoule. It ſeemes, ſaith Plotinus, that whatſoever is Faire and Beautifull, is alſo Good; for both theſe the Greeks expreſſe

by one and the ſame name, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : as if, ſaith he, the externall beauty of the Body, depended on the Internall Forme. And therefore the Ancient Greeks, conſidering this, accounted only thoſe men that were of a Beautifull and comely Aſpect, to be worthy of the Crowne and Scepter.
               
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  .
               And they prove this their opinion by the Examples of Priamus, Achilles, Saul, Cyrus, Darius, Alexander, Auguſtus, Hecuba, Andromache, Esther, and many others, in whom the Beauty and Perfection of the Soule, was attended on by that alſo of the Body: becauſe that the beauty of the Body depends on the goodneſſe of the Conſtitution and Temperature, according to Galen. Now it is agreed on, on Lib. 1. de San. tuend. all ſides in our Schooles, that a good and commendable complexion, is of times the cauſe of the Laudable Actions of the Body; and conſequently of thoſe alſo of the Mind. Multaenim in Corpore existunt, quae acuant mentem: multa quae obtundant.
                  
Saith Tully Tuſcul. 1. There are many things in the Body that conduce much to the ſharpening of the Mind and underſtanding: and there be alſo many things that dull it. And therefore Hippocrates in his Epidemicks lib. 6. Sect. 5. is of opinion, that it imports much to Wiſedome, to be Leane: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . For thoſe that are over-fat, Exhort. ad Bon diſc. Lib. 1. de ſan. tuend. L. 4. de Plac. ſaies Galen, have their ſoule as it were buried in a heape of durt; and therefore ſuch men are commonly heavy, and dull as a brute beaſt. Homer alſo ſpeaking of Therſites, that notorious Buffoon, whom Achilles ſlew with a boxe on the eare, deſcribes him to be ill-favoured, of a ridiculous dwarfe-like ſtature, with a ſharpe litle head, (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) intimating unto us, that ſuch men are generally Miſchievous, Envious, Impudent, and vaine-glorious fellowes. So Saluſt alſo notes Catiline for his Deformity, and Baſeneſſe of Conditions: and the ill-favoured lookes of Iulian the Apoſtate, was an Evident Argument of his Accurſed Life.
               On the contrary, we ſee commonly Epidem. l. 2. ſect. 5. 1. that, as Hippocrates obſerves, thoſe that

drawle out their words, and ſtammer in their ſpeech; 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , are of a good Nature. And agen, thoſe that have little, dry, hollow eyes, with a long, thin wrinkled viſage, are lewd, crafty, ſlaunderous, Ariſtot. Polem. Porta. envious, covetous, treacherous, ſacrilegious raſcally fellowes: Eſpecially, if they are wont to looke very ſtedfaſtly on any thing, and uſe to bite their lips when they are thinking of their buſineſſe: But above all, if they have but little beard.
               
                  
                     Poco barba, &amp; men Colore:
                  
                  
                     Sotto'l ciel non è peggiore.
                  
                  Saies the Italian;
                  
               
               He that has but litle beard on his face, and leſſe colour; there cannot poſſibly bee found a worſe complexion then his. And ſuch a one is that Villaine Melitus Pitheus, the falſe accuſer of Socrates, deſcribed to be in Plato. 
                  In Eutyph.
               
               Yet notwithſtanding all that I have ſaid, I would not have any man preſently conclude from theſe ſignes, on any mans complexion, as if they were alwaies neceſſarily

true For Alcibiades, who was the moſt beautiful &amp; comelieſt young mā in his time, was notwithſtanding a very vitious and envious perſon. And on the contrary the wiſe Socrates, notwithſtanding that he had a very ill favoured countenance, and was alſo bald-headed, hairy all over his body, and flat-noſed; yet was he pronounced by the Oracle of Apollo, to be the Patterne of Fortitude, Prudence and Temperance; notwithſtanding that he was often ſought unto, and tempted by women: as Tully reports it of him, in his booke De Fato. Cùm Socrates videret uxores in ſe jurgantes, &amp; ille eas deridebat; quòd propter ſe, foediſſimum hominem, ſimis narribus, recalvà fronte, piloſis humeris repandis cruribus, diſcreparent. Not but that he was Naturally inclined to Luſt; as Zopyrus, that famous Phyſiognomiſt judged of him, and as himſelfe ingenuouſly conſeſſed: but that by Morall Philoſophy he had corrected the bad Inclinations of his owne nature.
               Now all Phyſiognomy is grounded, as Phyſiog c. 1. &amp; 4. 
                  Ariſtotle ſaies, on the Sympathy that is betwixt the Body and the Mind. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  .

The Habit of the mind being altered, cauſeth an alteration alſo in the Body: and ſo the contrary. For, as the ſame Authour elſewhere concludes, if the manners of the mind did not all depend on the Temperature of the Body; in vaine ſhould the Phyſitian attempt, with all his Medicines and Helleboriſmes, the cure of thoſe that are ſicke of Love, or any the like Paſſions. Not that I would have you thinke, that theſe Phyſiognomicall ſignes doe alwaies neceſſarily diſcover the Paſſions and Affections of the mind, but only for the moſt part, and Probably.
               Beſides, all Phyſiognomiſts affirme, that we ought not peremptorily to conclude any thing, from the diſpoſition or Temperature of any one part alone: but wee muſt compare diverſe ſignes together, &amp; ſo give judgement accordingly: yet ſtill with this Proviſo, that we extend not the Iuriſdiction of this Science any farther, then to thoſe Paſſions that are Naturall to Men, as Anger, Luſt, &amp;c. and not to ſuch

things as are of Free Election, as to be an Aſtrologer, Phyſitian, Lawyer, or the like.
               We conclude then, that a man may know by Phyſiognomy, not onely thoſe that are actually poſſeſt with this Malady of Love, or Erotique Melancholy; but alſo thoſe that are Inclined, or ſubject unto it. For if I ſee a man that is Hot, Hairy, high-coloured, with a black thick curled head of haire, great veines, &amp; a big voice: I dare be bold to ſay, that that man hath a hot and dry Liver, and his Generative parts are alſo of the ſame Temper; &amp; that Gal. in Microt. Ariſt. 3. de gen. c. 1. &amp; Probl. 2. ſect. 4. &amp; 26. Sect. 10. Sueton. conſequently he is inclined to luſtfull deſires: But I ſhall be bold to affirme it more confidently, if he be alſo Bald withall, as was Socrates, Galba, Ʋitellius, Otho, Domitian, and Iulius Caeſar; (of whom it was once ſpoken thus by one at Rome. Vrbani, ſervate uxores; nam Moechum calvum adducimus: Citizens, looke well to your Wiues; for we have brought with Ariſt. c. 6. Phyſiogn. Probl. 19. ſect 4. Cap. ult. l. 2. meth. Med. us a Bald Whoremaſter.) Or elſe, if hee have litle Eares, a great Noſe, thick weak thighes, over-hanging Eye-browes, or is flat-noſed; as Socrates was. Valeſcus de Tarenta, the moſt famous Phyſitian of his

Age, obſerves the chapping of the Lips in Women to be a ſigne of their Inclination to this Malady: for that it denotes the Intemperate Heat of the Matrix, Quae appetit (to uſe his own words) ſemen, tanquam 
                  Lib. 2. de occult. Nat Mir. c. 26. 
                  Terra rorem. And Levinus Lemnius affirmes the ſame of thoſe perſons that are Lame, and Cripples: which is the Opinion alſo of Athenaeus, and Theocritus his Scholiaſt, who affirmes this to be the reaſon, which moved the Amazons to make their Children Cripples: Notwithſtanding Lib. de Artic. 
                  Hippocrates, an Author of greater credit then either of theſe, gives us other more probable reaſons for it.
               
                  Ariſtotle in his Lib. 2. de Gener. Animal. cap. 7. will have the Eyes alſo to bee very conſiderable in theſe Predictions: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : becauſe, ſaith he, the Eye is the moſt Spermaticall part about the Head. And indeed the Wiſeman knew an Adulterous Woman by her eyes better, and with more aſſurance, then any man can by the Hand: which cannot, as Averroës faith, denote the Diſpoſition of Lib. 2. col. c. 4. &amp; 6. the Body more particularly, then any other

of the Members, and conſequently neither our Affections nor Paſſions, any otherwiſe then by the beating of the Arteries in the Wriſt; or elſe perhaps by the figure of the Hand: according to which, ſome wil undertake to gueſſe at the Temperature of the Liver: Among which is Avicen, and Rhaſis, who by the greatneſſe of the Fingers, pretend to give a gueſſe at Fen. 2. l. 1. doct. 3. c. 1. &amp; Fen. 14 l. 3. tr. 1. that of the Liver, and endeavour to confirme this their conjecture both by reaſons, and Experience. For the Veines, being derived from the Liver, as from their Principium Radicationis &amp; Diſpenſationis; (for as Hippocrates lib. de Alimen. affirmes, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , The Liver is the Root, from whence all the Veines doe ſpring:) and being united, and meeting together in the Hand; they are the cauſe of that Mutuall and Reciprocall ſympathy that there is betwixt theſe two parts. And ſo by conſequent, the Temperature of the Liver will appeare more evidently in the Hand, then in many other of the parts of the Body. Beſides, the greatneſſe Th a Vega cap. 8. Art. Med. of the Fingers is an Argument of the greater Quantity of Matter, which is communicated

by the Liver to the extreame parts of the Body, and alſo of the greatneſſe of the Liver it ſelfe. Now thoſe that have a great Liver, are for the moſt part given to Gluttony; and Gluttons, we know are generally addicted to Venery and Laſciviouſneſſe.
               But this Art of Chiromancy, hath been C. illud. 26 q. 2. Tol. Sacerd. inſtr. c. 15. l. 4 ſo ſtrangely infected with Superſtition, Deceit, Cheating, and (if I durſt ſay ſo) with Magick alſo; that the Canoniſts, and of late yeares, Pope Sixtus Quintus, have beene conſtrained utterly to condemne it. So that now, no man profeſſeth publikely this Cheating Art, but Theeues, Rogues, and beggerly Raſcals; which are now every where knowne by the name of Bohemians, Egyptians, and Caramaras; and firſt came into theſe parts of Europe, about the yeare 1417 as G.

               CAP. XXIII. Whether or no, by Magick a Man may know any one to be in Love.
               
               THere have not been wanting ſome, that out of thoſe words of Plato, in Convivio, where hee ſaies, that Love is, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , a great Magician and Inchanter, have beene bold impiouſly to maintaine, that this diſeaſe of Love can neither be found out, nor cured, without the uſe of Magick. But this opinion of theirs I ſhall hereafter in a more convenient place examin, only telling you here; that as there are ſome Stomacks of ſo ill a Complexion, as that they corrupt the beſt Meats, in ſtead of digeſting them: ſo are there ſome men of ſo malicious and virulent a diſpoſition, as that they will not ſtick to deprave and corrupt the meaning

of the writings of the moſt Authentique Authors.
               It is true indeed, that there are two findes of Magick: the one Naturall, and the other Artificiall. By the former of theſe we underſtand, an Exact and Perfect knowledge of the Secrets of Nature; which makes us able to Prognoſticate and 
                     ••
                  retell Future Events, by the knowledge of things Paſt, and Preſent. And this is that Magick which is ſtiled by Hippocrates,

               But the Artificiall, whether it be Ope,

                  ative, or Divinative, is moſt abominable, and utterly forbidden by all Lawes, both Divine and Humane.
               Profeſſors of this Impious Art were of old, Numa Pompilius, Zoroaſter, Pythagoras, Hoſtanus Procones, Democritus, the Aegyptian Prieſts, the Perſian Magi, and the French Druides: and at this preſent time, as they ſay, the Jewiſh Rabbins. This Accurſed Art comprehends within it a

Thouſand other kinds, reckoned up by the Canoniſts, Cap. Illud. 26. q 2 ſeq. &amp; Cap. Igitur, &amp; ſeq, q, 3. and alſo by Giraldus Franciſcus Ʋenetus, Polydor Ʋirgil, Veckerus, Delrio, and Others.
               We have alſo ſometimes among out ſilly Wenches ſome, that out of a fooliſh curioſity they have, muſt needs be putting in practiſe ſome of theſe Feats that they have receaved by Tradition from their Mother perhaps, or Nurſe; &amp; ſo, not thinking forſooth to doe any harme, as they hope, they Paganize it to their own Damnation. For it is moſt certaine that Botanomancy, which is done by the noiſe or crackling that Kneeholme, Box, or Bayleaves make, when they are cruſhed betwixt ones hands, or caſt into the Fire, was of old in uſe among the Pagans, who were wont to bruiſe Poppy flowres betwixt their hands, by this meanes thinking to know their Loves: And for this cauſe Theocritus cals this hearb

               Oionoſcopy is a kind of Divination that is performed by the obſerving of certaine Birds, as Magpies, Crowes, Ravens, Sparrowes,

Owles, and all thoſe other kindes of Birds which they call, Oſcines. To which kinde of Divination wee may alſo referre thoſe Auguria, ſo much in uſe among the Ancient Heathens: and in fine conclude with the Poet Pacuvius concerning theſe Bird-maſters, who ſaies thus of them.

                  Theocritus in his Idyllia, makes mention of the Art of Coſcinomancy, which is to be done with a Sive, or Search made of Haire: and ſome others of Cleromancy, 
                     •
                  y the chance or hazard of Fortune, which they call Preneſtine. Others ſpeake alſo of another kinde of Divination, by the opening

of a Booke at all adventures: and this was called the Valentinian Chance, and by ſome Sortes Virgilianae: of which the Emperour Adrian was wont to make very much uſe. I ſhall omit to ſpeak here of Aſtragalomancy, that was done with Huckle bones; Ceromancy, and all other ſuch like fooleries: and conclude, that no man ought to have recourſe unto the Profeſſors of them, either for the finding out, or curing of this Malady, but rather to a skilfull and diſcreet Phyſitian.

                  MAcrobius upon Tullies ſomnum Scipionis, and Hugo de S. Ʋictore, make five kindes of Dreames: but S. Gregory in his Morals, lib. 8. cap. 16. &amp; lib. 4.

                  Dial. cap. 4. will have them to be ſixe. Tertullian reſtraines them to Three ſorts; and Hippocrates acknowledges but Two; and thoſe are, either Divine, or Naturall. Now if we ſhould comprehend the Animall, under the Naturall; and the Diabolicall, under the Divine; it were an eaſie matter to reconcile the differences of theſe Authors ſeverall Opinions. Notwithſtanding Aristotle, and Petronius will not acknowledge the Divine at all.

                     For when the Soule's wrapt in a gentle Trance,

               The reaſons that he brings to prove, that no Dreames are Divine, are in my Opinion of no validity at all, if a Man but examine them throughly: However, his authority is of leſſe moment and force, then that of Moſes; which is alſo ſeconded both by Hippocrates, and Homer; who affirmes, that

               Thoſe Dreames we call Diabolicall, that are cauſed by Evill Spirits: ſuch as was that of the Emperour Tiberius, who, by the meanes of a knaviſh Magician, was made to Dreame, that he muſt give Him ſuch a certaine ſumme of Money: But the

Emperour, by chance comming to the knowledge of this Cheaters plot, inſtead of the money, beſtowed a halter upon him for his paines.
               The Pagans were wont to expect theſe Dreames, lying all night upon skinnes, ſpread on the Ground, either in the Temple of Aeſculapius, or elſe in that of Caſtor and Pollux, as appeares out of Virgil. Aeneid lib. 7.

                     Multa modis ſimulachra videt volitantia miris,
                     Et varias audit voces; fruitur

                     He, lying downe on skinnes ſpread on the ground,
                     Expects his Dreame: when ſtraight, encircling round
                     The ſacred Fane, ſtrange awfull ſhapes appeare:
                     Whilſt from the Gods, Deepe Accents ſtrike his eare.
                  
               
               But the Women, when they were wounded

with Cupids dart, would chooſe rather to goe to the Goddeſſe Bona, then to Aeſculapius; if it were Naturall Love, &amp; not that Prepoſterous Luſt, that Nature abhorres: unto which many of them ofttimes baſely yeelded up themſelves, never thinking of God at all; who for this abominable ſin of theirs, would never remember them, but for their Puniſhment. And if perchance they had had ſome confuſed Dreame or other; then preſently would they have recourſe to ſome cheating Wizards for the Interpretation of it; which theſe ſubtle Raſcals would be ſure ſhould be ſuch a one as ſhould pleaſe their good Dreaming Dame.
               Qualiacun
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   voles, Iudaeus ſomnia vendit. Spondet Amatorem tenerū; vel divitis orbi Teſtamentum ingens, &amp;c.
               Naturall Dreames are ſuch as are cauſed by the Diſpoſition and Temper of the Body. For in ſleepe, the ſoule doth, as it were, retire into the moſt Inmoſt and Secreteſt part of her Palace: where being free from all diſturbance, ſhe the more eaſily

apprehends the Diſpoſition and State of the Body, and enjoyes all things that the can deſire, whether Poſſible things, or impoſſible, as though they were preſent, and in her power.
               The conſideration of theſe Dreames, is, by the generall conſent of all writers, very neceſſary in Phyſick, for the knowledge of the Humour that doth predominate, &amp; to finde out the diſpoſition of the Body. For commonly thoſe that are full of Humours, dreame that they carry ſome great burthen upon their back: whereas on the contrary thoſe, that are free from all Repletion, dreame that they are either running a Race, or leaping, or perhaps Flying in the Aire. The Cholericke Dreame of Quarrelling, and Fighting; the Melancholy of Funerals, Darkneſſe, and Mourning. The Phlegmaticke and Rheumaticke dreame that they are fallen into Rivers, Wels, Raine and Snow: Thoſe that are Hungry dreame of good cheere, &amp; Feaſts; and the Amoriſt of his Wenches, Sports, Plaies and Maſques.
               And here by the way you are to take notice, that in Dreames all things ſeeme

greater, and either more pleaſing or diſpleaſing, then indeed they are: the reaſons whereof, he that deſires to ſee, may have recourſe to Thomas à Vega upon Galen.
               
               The Animall Dreames proceed from thoſe things that a man hath either done, ſeen, or thought upon in the day time, as Herodotus ſaith: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : the Fancy in Sleep is moſt taken up with thoſe things that the Minde hath been buſied with in the day. The Good, ſaith Ariſtotle have good Dreames: becauſe that when they were awake, they had good Thoughts in their Minde. Such were the Dreames of the Primitive Chriſtians; becauſe they continually medicated, ſaies Philo Iudaeus, on the Power and Providence of God. The Lawyer pleads in his ſleep: The Souldier Fights: The Marriner cuts over the ſurging Seas; and the Hunter returnes home loaded with his Game. According to that in the Poet.
               
                  
                     Iudicibus lites; Aurigae ſomnia, Currus:

                           que
                         nocturnis meta cavatur Equis.
                     Jaudet Amans furto, &amp;c.
                  
                  
                     
                     The Lawyer pleads in's ſleep: the carefull Swaines
                     Manage their pranſing Courſers ore the plaines.
                     Lovers dreame ore their ſtol'n delights. &amp;c.
                  
               
               And if by chance our dreames be not conformable to our actions and thoughts in the day time, it is an argument of ſome diſtemper among the humours. So that it ſeemes to be very poſſible for a man to know, whether one be in Love, or no, by his Naturall and Animall dreames, if ſo be the party will but truly relate them at his waking; and that without any regard had at all either to the Starres, or any other ſuch Fopperies, as are to be found in Iulianus Cervus, Artemidorus, Arnaldus Villanovanus, and other ſuch like Authors as theſe, who have infected the ſcience of Phyſicke with a thouſand toyes and fooleries.

                  ALexander Piccolomineus in his Ethicks, Lib. 10. cap. 7. Labours to prove, that true Love muſt be free, and void of all Iealouſy: Becauſe that he that purſues any thing with a vertuous deſire, is glad to find any companions in his purſuit; for this may not only further him in the attaining of it, but may alſo ſerve for an argument of the worth of the Object of his deſires. For it is Weakneſſe only that is afraid of an Incounter, as being conſcious of it's owne inſufficiency and want of power to reſiſt.
               But Plutarch is of the contrary opinion, and ſaies, that as Vertue is not Praiſeworthy, nor produceth any laudable effects, unleſſe it elevate the heart, and raiſe in it an earneſt deſire and Emulation, to be

like good men, and to be accompliſhed with all thoſe Indowments that are requiſite for the attainement of the height of perfection: ſo Love, if it have not a tin

I for my part am of Simonides his opinion whoſe ſaying it was, that as every Lapwing has a tuft upon his head, ſo muſt every true Lover have a touch of jealouſie and that from hence it will neceſſarily follow, that Phaulius, that voluntary Cuckold, that plaid the Pandar for King Philip, with his owne wife, did not love her with any true love. Nor that infamous Galba in Rome, who having one night invited Mecoenas to come and ſup with him, and perceiving him, as they ſate a
                     •
                   the table, to caſt amourous glances on his wife, when ſupper was ended, he tooke occaſion to counterfeit himſelfe aſleepe to the end that Mecoenas might have the more liberty to court his wife to his deſires. Meane while there comes a ſervant of his into the roome, who finding his Maſter, as he thought, aſleep, went toward the table, thinking to ſteale a cup of wine that ſtood there: which his Maſter Galba Perceiving, and not willing to looſe his wine, he hindred his ſervants purpoſe with a ſudden exclamation; and cries our unto him, Non omnibus dormio, I doe not ſleep for every body; but only for Mecoenas.

And then the ſame cauſes that ſerved at the firſt to build Love upon, ſerve afterward to raiſe as deadly a hatred: as namely the Vertues, Beauty, Worth, Reputation of the party beloved. So that if it were poſſible for a man to make his choice, from which of all the evills in the

world be free; he could not, in my opinion, make a fitter choice, then of this miſchievous Iealouſy. Becauſe that in all others, the paine endures no longer the the cauſe: but Iealouſy ſprings indifferently from that which is, and from that which is not, nor perhaps never ſhall be. O the Ingenuity of this Paſſion! which hath the power, out of an Imaginary evill, to draw a true, and reall torment. Thus the famous Painter Parrhaſius was wont to put his owne ſervants to torture, that by ſeeing them, he might be the better able t

               Why are we ſo ambitious of our Miſeries, as to run to meet them, and make them prevent Imagination? We ſee that many have loſt their Miſtreſſes, only for ſuſpecting their Chaſtity: as we often ſee thoſe perſons that are troubled with Hypochondriacall Melancholy, to fall ſicke, with the very feare of being ſo.
               So that we may conclude, that Iealouſy of times cauſes us to be overtaken by that which we deſire moſt of all to avoyde: and therefore a witty fellow once ſaid,

that Iealouſy, and Cuckoldry, had their feaſt kept both on a day. And indeed this ſeemes to be confirmed alſo by many examples; as namely, that of Danaë, who ſo long as ſhe enjoyed her liberty, continued Chaſt: but ſhe was no ſooner impriſoned in the brazen Tower by her jealous Father, but preſently ſhe was loſt. For, as the old Comicke Poet ſaith,

               CAP. XXVI. The Prognoſticks of Love, and Erotique Melancholy.
               
               MAny have been of opinion that this diſeaſe was altogether incurable; and that it was wholy Supernaturall, and inflicted upon men as a puniſhment, or revenge for ſome evill committed by them, from a kind of litle Daemon of the ſame name; to whom the Pagans attributed the command of Love; as they alſo did of Feavers, to the Goddeſſe Febris; the Night Mare to Hecate, or the Demy-Gods; the Terrors and affrights in the Night, to Pan: the Falling ſickneſſe, to Hercules: ſo likewiſe making Cupid the God of Love; Venus, of Luſt; Mercury, of Theevery; and Mars of Choler and Anger: that ſo by this meanes they might find the juſter excuſe of thoſe outrages, which, when they were tranſported with their Paſſions,

they did commit. Quaſi de Caelo tibi ſit Inevitabilis cauſa peccandi; &amp; Venus hoc fecerit, aut Saturnus, aut Mars: ſcilicet ut homo ſine culpâ ſit; culpandus autem Caeli ac Syderum Creator &amp; Ordinator. As if, (ſaith Auguſtine) the heavens had impoſed an inevitable neceſſity upon men of doing ill: and that the cauſe of this, or that ill action was either Venus, or Saturne, or Mars: that ſo man, forſooth, ſhould ſtill be innocent; and all the blame be caſt on God, the great Creator and diſpoſer of the Heavens and Starres.
               It is the cuſtome of ignorant fooles, ſaith Hippocrates, preſently to ſay, that a diſeaſe, and the cauſes of it are Divine, when they doe but find ſome new extraordinary matter in it. So that by this rule we muſt conclude, that all new diſeaſes, as the Coqueluchoe, a diſeaſe that the French not many yeares ſince were infeſted with, the ſweating ſickneſſe, ſmall Pockes, and the like, ſhould be Divine, and therefore held incurable, becauſe perhaps they cannot be cured by the idle Preſcriptions of Empericks, Mountebanks, and cooſening Impoſtors, nor by

the charmes and juglings of Magicians and Sorcerers.
               
               Beſides, ſeeing that all manner of perſons are not equally ſubject to this diſeaſe, as, for example, Eunuches, children, and decrepit old folke: and that Love, as we have already ſhewed, ſprings from the eyes, growes ſtronger by daily converſation and familiarity, kiſſing and embracings and other amorous paſſages; and is raiſed to the height of rage by the uſe of certaine Animals, Plants, and Minerals; but is quite extinguiſhed by other remedies that are endued with the contrary qualities: There is no ſhew of probability that this Malady ſhould be ſupernaturall and Divine, rather then any other. For in all diſeaſes in generall Hippocrates acknowledgeth that there is 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : ſomething Divine.
               We conclude then, with Galen, that neither Love, nor the Falling-ſickneſſe, are Divine diſeaſes. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
               
               Non Deus, ut perhibent, amor eſt; ſed amaror, &amp; error.
               
                  
Some others have conceived Love to be incurable, becauſe that for the moſt part, he that is ſicke of this diſeaſe, does not deſire to be cured of it.
               
                  
                     Vive, Deus, poſito, ſi quis mihi dicat, Amore:

                           que

                     Should Iove ſay; leave thy Love, and ſhun thy Fate.
                     I would not purchaſe't at ſo high a rate.
                  
               
               For he ſtill feedes himſelfe with his owne vaine hopes of being able to find a cure, without the help of Phyſicke; and beares it out with a good face, pretending that it is nothing, but a meere flea-biting.
               
                  Amantis credula vitam
                  Spes fovet: &amp; meliùs cras fore, ſemper ait.
                  Sed quia delectat Veneris decerpere fructus; Dicimus aſſidue, cras quo
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      fiet idem.
                  Interea tacitae ſerpunt in viſcer a flammae.
               
               His owne credulity ſtill makes him hope; and this hope keeps him alive, in

expectation ſtill of the accompliſhment of his deſires: which when he hath once attained unto, he then conceives himſelfe to have reached the higheſt degree of happineſſe; and perſwades himſelfe that theſe his joyes and pleaſures ſhall never faile: till at the laſt, his owne experience convincing him, leaves him more miſerable then before.
               This Hope, blowing with it's gentle gales the fond deſires of Lovers, kindles in their minds a fire, full of thicke ſmoake, which darkens their underſtanding; and carrying away with it their thoughts, caſts a miſt over them, takes away their judgement, ſubverts their reaſon, and makes them, as it were, dreame waking. As long as theſe hopes laſt, they will never relinquiſh their deſires. And here ye ſhall have one, that doubts not, (how unhandſome ſoever he be) to mollify the Adamantine heart of his Miſtreſſe, by the force of his beauty and comely ſhape: another, by his faire carriage and winning behaviour: a third preſumes upon his greatneſſe of birth, and the Nobility of his Progenitors: a fourth hopes to winne

her by his witty and eloquent diſcourſe: however if all theſe faile, there is great hope that at length ſhe may be moved to compaſſion by ſighes and pittifull complaints: which is indeed the Lovers laſt refuge.
               I ſhall therefore eaſily grant to the Sectaries of this opinion, concerning the incurableneſſe of this diſeaſe, that it is no ſmall taske to cure a ſicke man of a diſeaſe, that he is unwilling to part with: conſidering that the cure of any diſeaſe depends as much upon the Patient, as on the Phyſitian. For as Hippocrates ſaith: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : for the curing of a diſeaſe, it is required of the Patient alſo, as well as of the Phyſitian, that he make what reſiſtance he can againſt it, and by no meanes yield to it in the leaſt degree. But yet is it not a thing utterly impoſſible to work ſuch a cure as this: for there may be meanes found out of times to bring the Patient to deſire and ſeeke out for cure of his Malady: as we ſhall ſhew you hereafter, in the 32. Chapter of this Tract.
               Laſtly, ſome learned Authours have

ſaid, that this diſeaſe was incurable, not ſo much through the fault of the Patient, as the inſufficiency and defect of the Agent; which is, the remedies that are applied in this caſe. This made the Deſpairing Oenone, more skilfull farre in love, then Phyſicke, cry out in this manner.
               
                  Me miſeram! Quòd amor non eſt medicabilis herbis.
                  Deſtituor, prudens artis, ab arte meâ.
               
               And even Apollo himſelfe, the Author and firſt Inventor of Phyſick, is jeered by the Poet, for not knowing any remedy for the cure of this diſeaſe of Love; when he brings him in thus complaining, that he was not able to releive himſelfe with all his skill.
               
                  
                     Nec potui curas ſanare ſalubribus herbis.
                     Quic quid erat Medicae, vicerat, Artis, Amor.
                  
                  
                     No healthfull hearbes my Torment could allay.
                     My Art was forc'd my Loves pow'r to obey.
                  
               
               
                  
But thoſe men that maintaine this opinion, doe not only offer great injury to the faculty of Phyſick, which, as Democritus ſaies, is the ſiſter and companion of wiſdome: but ſeem alſo fooliſhly to accuſe the Almighty Creator, who, being the Prototype of all goodneſſe, (as Galen ſaith) hath not denied us any thing, that is neceſſary for us. So that if God hath given us any remedies for this diſeaſe; it cannot poſſibly be imagined, but that they ſhould have beene diſcovered in the ſpace of ſixe or ſeven thouſand yeares, either by reaſon, or experience; which are the only meanes by which Phyſitians have found out cures for all diſeaſes.
               Neither is it to any purpoſe to fly to this refuge, and ſay, that Love is a diſeaſe of the mind; &amp; that therefore the cure thereof is to be left to Moraliſts, and Divines: conſidering that the wiſe Apollonius Thyaneus refuſed to undertake the cure of a great Cilician Nobleman, that was deſperately gone with this diſeaſe, &amp; could not be moved, neither by his large promiſes, nor threats. For all the Ancient Phyſitians have handled the cure of this diſeaſe, not

ſimply as Phyſitians, but as Philoſophers alſo, which is an inſeparable quality from a good Phyſitian: as Galen, following the doctrine of Hippocrates, hath proved at large, in an entire Tract concerning this particular.
               And if the mind bee afflicted at all in Love; it is by reaſon of the mutuall Sympathy that there is betwixt it, and the body: as Ariſtotle proves plainly in his Phyſiognomy, and in many other places, which I ſhall not here trouble you withall; only concluding with that of Democritus, who affirmes that the diſeaſes of the body doe infatuate and dull the mind, and draw the underſtanding alſo to Sympathize with it: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Cleomenes, the ſonne of Anaxandrides, being ſicke; his friends reproved him, and told him, that they obſerved in him other ſtrange humours and fancies, then they were wont to doe: To whom he made this reply; that they ought not to blame him for this: For neither ſaith he; am I the ſame man, now I am ſicke, that I was before: being then changed from what I was, no marvaile, if

my humours and fancies be changed alſo. If an Apoplexy can lay aſleepe, and, as it were, quite put out the eye of our underſtanding: then queſtionleſſe Melancholy, and Love will caſt a miſt at leaſt before it; and ſo by this meanes there will hardly be found one houre in our whole life, when our judgement will bee found in due order, our body being ſubject to ſo many mutations, and incompaſſed with ſuch variety of actions, that it is a great chance if it meet not at all times with ſome one or other, that will draw it out of the way; although perhaps a man cannot at all times take notice of it, without being obnoxious to a Perpetuity of Paſſion.
               Theſe conſiderations moved the ſame Philoſopher to wiſh, that all men were skilfull in Phyſick: that ſo by rectifying the ſtate of their Body, they might alſo preſerve their mind in perfect health. Which is confirmed alſo by Galen in his Praecog. where he boaſts, that he had cured many of their Bodily diſeaſes, only by appeaſing the Perturbations of their Mind, and that, both by naturall remedies, and alſo ſubtle conceits and deviſes, intermixt

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  .
               Whence we may draw this conſequence, that thoſe that baniſh all kind of good Language and diſcourſe from the Art of Phyſick, are carried away wholly with malice, and their owne fond opinion. And therefore the Poet was much to be blamed, when he abuſes it with the title of a Mute, dumbe Science.

               Vnleſſe perhaps ſome body will undertake to excuſe Virgill here, and ſay, that he calls it, a Mute Faculty, becauſe that, as Hippocrates ſaies, a Phyſitian muſt not be a Prating, Babling fellow; for, as the old Comoedian ſaies.
               
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  .
               
                  
Such a Phyſitian is the worſt diſeaſe of the Two.
               We conclude then, that Loue is not incurable, though it be indeed ſomewhat hard to be cured: and therefore the Poëts were wont to attribute unto it, the feet of a Gryphon; to intimate unto us, that Love enters ſwiftly, but retires very ſlowly,
               Amor animi arbitrio ſumitur; non ponitur.
               A man may fall in Love, when he pleaſes; but he cannot ſo eaſily get out againe.
               And yet this Malady is ſo much the more hard to be cured, if it be accompanied with thoſe Symptomes mentioned in the ſecond Chapter; but eſpecially that of Iealouſy.
               
                  Qui timet ut ſua ſit, ne quis ſibi ſubtrahat illam;
                  Ille Machaoniâ vix ope tutus erit.
               
               He that is Iealous leaſt he looſe his Love, Machaon's art cannot his griefe remove.
               
                  
For then the Heart and Braine doe both ſuffer by the ſympathy of the Liver, and ſecret parts. Now Hippocrates ſaies, that 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Thoſe diſeaſes that ariſe from the ſtrongeſt parts of the Body, are alwaies the moſt grievous.
               The Aſtrologers ſay, that there is required a great deale both of Time, care, and diligence, for the cure of thoſe perſons, that are firſt taken with this diſeaſe, under the Influence of Saturne; eſpecially if at that time he were either Retrograde, or in Conjunction with Mars, or in Oppoſition with the Sun. But if Venus were found in the Houſe of Saturne, or was in a Trine, or Sextile Aſpect with the Moon, when the party was firſt ſeazed on by this diſeaſe: there is great danger then that he will be long afflicted with it. This is the Aſtrologers opinion: and to this I will adde mine owne; which is, that if Old men chance to fall into this diſeaſe, they are more grievouſly tormented with it, then young men are: according to that of Menander.
               
               
                  
Senex, Amore captus, ultimum malum.
               For as Hippocrates in his Aphoriſmes affirmes: Thoſe Diſeaſes that are not agreable to the Nature, Complexion, and Age of the party affected, are the moſt dangerous of all other. And ſuch is Love, in old men: which is one of thoſe things, Solomon could not endure. And conformable hereto is that of the Comoedian, where he ſaies, that
               Amare, Iuveni fructus eſt, Crimen Seni.
               It was very good and profitable for a young man to be in Love, but a great fault in an old man to be ſo. And as Pindarus, ſpeaking of the unjuſt deſires of covetous men, ſaies, that 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : men are wont with the greater eagerneſſe, and with a kind of Madneſſe to deſire thoſe things that they cannot compaſſe: the ſame hath Hippocrates pronounced of old doting men that are in Love.
               And Avicen ſaies, that if this diſeaſe

come once to be Habituall, it is then altogether uncurable, and makes the parties affected Hecticall, Sottiſh, and Fooliſh; and ſometimes alſo they are ſo bad, that they grow wolfe-mad, or perhaps turne to be their owne murtherers: as I have already ſhewed by diverſe examples.
            
            
               CAP. XXVII. Of the Incubi, and Succubi.
               
               SOme Divines have been of opinion, that Irregular and Melancholy Love, extends its power and Iuriſdiction, as farre as to the very Angells, and Divels alſo: and that this is the reaſon, why the women are commanded by S. Paul to have their heads covered in the Church. But, by this word Angell, ſome others will have the Miniſters of the Church to be underſtood; who in their Sanctity of Life ſhould be like unto the Angels: or elſe perhaps the Apoſtle meant, by Angels,

all good Chriſtians, who by the Integrity of their life, and purity of Conſcience, doe differ as much from the common prophaner ſort of men, as Angels doe from men. But thoſe that hold the other opinion, urge for themſelves that paſſage in Geneſis, where Moſes ſaies, that, the ſonnes of God, ſeeing the daughters of Men, that they were faire, they fell in love with them. In the explication of which place, Ioſephus, Clemens Alexandrinus, Juſtin Martyr, and others, by the Sonnes of God, underſtand the Angels. Notwithſtanding R. Abraham Aben Ezra interprets this place of Vertuous Men, or elſe the ſonnes of Righteous Seth: and by the Daughters of Men, he will have the daughters of wicked Cain to be meant. Rabbi Kimchi thinks that, by the Sonnes of God, men of great ſtature were meant: and that, according to the Idiotiſme and uſuall manner of ſpeaking among the Hebrews, who are wont to call thoſe men that are very tall, the Mountaines of God. And this interpretation of his ſeems alſo to be confirmed by that which followes; where it is ſaid, that to

of theſe mariages that were made betwixt the Sonnes of God and the Daughters of men, were brought forth Giants.
               For mine owne part, I ſhall be ready; as in this, ſo in all other places of Scripture, to ſubmit my ſelfe to the determination of Divines. But I ſhall hardly even aſſent to that ridiculous conceit of the Rabbins, who are of Opinion, that the Incubi and Succubi are ſprung from the ſeed of Adam, during the ſpace of thoſe 135. years; that he abſtained from the knowledge of his wife, after the Murther of the juſt Abel, committed by his accurſed brother Cain. A more incredible thing yet then this is, if I miſtake not, is that which is commonly reported by Hiſtorians, of women that have been gotten with Child by Divells, and Jncubi: and of ſuch copulations, they ſay, were begotten, Hercules, Romulus, Servius Tullus, Merlin, and many others. I grant it poſſible, that the Divell may delude the ſenſes and Fancy of ſuch lewd women, and cauſe their belly to ſwell, as if they had had carnall copulation really with a Man: and perhaps in their travaile make them

ſeeme to be delivered of a dead Child. Iacobus Rucſſius relates a ſtory of one Magdalen, that lived in the Citty of Conſtance, who having given way to a Divell or Incubus, that haunted her, by the perſwaſion of her Confeſſor, was at the time of her travaile delivered of a thouſand Trumperies, as pieces of broken glaſſes, Nailes, pieces of wood, haire, pitch, tow, ſtones, bones, and ſuch like ſtuffe, but with extreame paine. And ſometimes alſo the Divell aſſumes a dead body, and by this meanes enticeth wicked minded perſons to couple with him. Vincentius reports a ſtory to this purpoſe, of a certaine young man, who one evening going out to a river, to ſwimme and waſh himſelfe, as he was in the water, he caught a woman by the haire of the head: whom preſently he carried home along with him to his houſe, without ſpeaking a word; and afterward had a ſonne by her. But the woman never ſpeaking one word all this while, made the young man very much wonder at the ſtrangeneſſe of it: and deſirous to try if he could make her breake of this her long ſilence, which made both

himſelfe, and all his kindred very much ſuſpect the condition and ſtrange production of this monſtrous Child, he made her beleeve one day that he would kill her ſonne; at which ſhe ſpake ſome few words, but inſtantly vaniſht out of his ſight. Iacobus Rueſſius tells a ſtory of a Butcher, that was in the like manner ſeduced by a Succubus: not much unlike that of Machates and Philinion, related by Aelian, Phlegon, Loyer, and Le ſieur de l' Ancre. If any deſire to ſee more concerning this particular, he may have recourſe to Rueſſius, in his diſcourſe of Melancholy: where he plainely proves that of St 
                  Chryſoſtome to be true, that Quoſcun
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      Diabolus ſuperat, per Melancholiam ſuperat. Whom ſo ever the Divell overcomes, he overcomes by Melancholy. And therefore the Phyſitians for very good reaſon call Melancholy, the Divell Bath.
               
               Yet is it moſt certaine, that ſome women have verily thought that they have been forced by the Divell, or ſome Witch or other; when as in truth they were only troubled with the Nightmare,

a diſeaſe which the Latines call Incubus, the Greekes 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , Jnſilire: and by ſome, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Themiſon cals it 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , to ſuffocate, or ſtrangle: the Arabians call it, Alchabum, Algiathum, or Alneidalan, as Avicen ſaith.
               This Diſeaſe takes them commonly in their firſt ſleepe, when as the thick groſſe vapors which are carried up to the Braine, ſtop the Nerves that ſerve for ſpeech and Reſpiration: by which meanes the parties thus troubled, think they have a heavy burthen lying upon them, or elſe ſome Divell, or Witch, that would attempt a breach upon their Chaſtity. And therefore Hippocrates ſaies, that Maides that are marriageable, and Widdowes, when they are troubled with Love-Melancholy, thinke that they ſee the Divell, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : for he doth not ſay, that they doe ſee ſuch things.
               And although that this diſeaſe is cauſed 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , by the abundance of vapours ariſing from Repletion and Inconcoction, and accending up into

the Braine: yet Phyſitians call it not by the name of the Night-mare, or Incubus, unleſſe the Imagination alſo be hurt withall, in like manner as in Melancholy, which diſeaſe it often preſageth; or elſe the Falling ſickneſſe.
               I could adde here, that I my ſelfe have ſeene, in the towne of Caſtelnadaruy in Lauraguex, two young women, that maintained confidently for a certaine truth, that either the Divell, or ſome witch or other, lay with them every night, as their husbands lay by their ſides: Both which by the helpe of God I cured, and they now acknowledge the weakneſſe of their Fancy, and their owne Folly.
            
            
               
               CHAP. XXVIII. Whether the Love of Women be ſtronger, and more dangerous then that of Men.
               
               IT is moſt certaine, that, as Galen ſaies, a Hot complexion, or ſuch a one that is Hot and Dry, is much more prone to diſhoneſt and irregular Love, then any other Complexiō, or Temperature whatſoever: from whence we may alſo inferre, that the Loves of theſe Complexions, muſt neceſſarily be alſo the moſt violent, and ſo by Conſequence, that Men muſt be oftner, and more grievouſly tormented with this Malady, then Women, who are of a Temperature both leſſe Hot, and leſſe Dry: For as much as Nature had never brought forth a Woman, but only for want of Heat; and therfore Ariſtotle calls them the Defect, and Imperfection of Nature: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                  
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . The Female ſeemes only to be the Iſſue of Natures Impotence.
               But Chryſippus the Philoſopher, as Galen reports him, neglecting theſe weake reaſons, affirmes the contrary: and ſaies, that Love is a Motion of the Minde, that is irrefragable, &amp; oppoſeth it ſelfe againſt the power and rule of Reaſon: which is alſo approved both by Aristotle, and alſo all the Schoole of Phyſick.
               Whence we may conclude, that without all doubt a Woman is in her Loves more Paſſionate, and more furious in her follies, then a man is: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : ſaies Hippocrates, lib. de his quae ad Ʋirg. spect. Women are Naturally of meaner Spirits and leſſe courage, then Men; neither is their reaſon ſo ſtrong as theirs: and therefore are they leſſe able to make reſiſtance againſt ſo ſtrong a Paſſion, as Galen ſaies. And hereto agrees that of the faire Hero, in her Epiſtle to her deare Leander.
               
               
                  
                     
                        Ʋrimur igne pari: ſed ſum tibi viribus Jmpar.
                     Fortius ingenium ſuspicor eſſe viris.
                     
                        Ʋt corpus, teneris, ſic mens infirma puellis.
                  
                  
                     
                     Our flames are equall: but your kinder Fate
                     Hath lent your ſtrength, your Heats to temperate.
                     But in our weaker Sexe, our Paſſions find.
                     A feeble Body beares a feebler Minde.
                  
               
               This opinion is confirmed alſo by daily experience, which affords us Examples great ſtore of Women, that are ready to run Mad for Love; but ſeldome any Men, whom we never ſee brought to that Extremity: unleſſe they be ſome effeminate weake ſpirited fellowes, that have been alwaies broughtup in Laſcivious courſes, and in Ladies Laps. And this is confirmed by the Poet alſo.

                     Luſt in us Men doth not ſo often raigne.
                     Our Flames would ſtill a lawfull end attaine.
                  
               
               This Aſſertion may alſo bee proved by a ſtrong Naturall reaſon, which may be collected out of Ariſtotle, lib. 3, de Part. Animal. cap. 4. &amp; lib. 1. de Gener. cap. 4.

where he ſaies, that Nature hath given ſtreight Entrals, or Guts, without any turnings, or windings at all, to all gluttonous and ravenous Creatures; as Birds of prey, and the Wolfe: but on the contrary, ſhee hath variouſly and artificially interwoven the Bowels of thoſe that it was expedient ſhould bee ſober and temperate; as Men. Whence we collect, that, Quoniam eadem Natura (quae 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

So that although perhaps Men appeare outwardly to be the more prone to Luſt of

               CAP. XXIX. Of the Prevention of Love, and Erotique Melancholy.
               
               FOR the Prevention of any Diſeaſe, it is neceſſary, ſaith Galen, in the firſt place, to remove the Diſpoſition of the

Body, which is nothing elſe but the Internall cauſe of the Diſeaſe: and which cannot be rooted out, except the Externall cauſe, that nouriſhes and preſerves it, bee firſt taken away. He then that undertakes the Cure, or Prevention of Love-Melancholy, muſt firſt, ſaith Hippocrates, have a perfect knowledge of the nature of this Diſeaſe, that ſo he may 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , apply ſuch remedies, as ſhall bee proper both for the Diſeaſe, Nature, and Age of the Patient, and alſo agree with the Seaſons, and Times of the yeare. Otherwiſe he does but ſtrike at the diſeaſe, Andabatarum more, Hoodwink'd.
               And becauſe that Love findes its paſſage through the Eye, and ſo ſeazeth on the Braine: If he intend to caſhiere it utterly, he muſt take heed, that no tempting Objects preſent themſelves unto it: leaſt happily it fall out here, as it did heretofore to Menelaus, who (as Galen relates it) when that Troy was now taken, and he had fully reſolved with his own hands to puniſh his Wives Adulteries: he no ſooner ſaw her, but that preſently hee let his

Sword fall out of his hand, and ran to her 
                     •
                  d threw himſelfe into her Embraces. 
                     •
                  nd ſo by the power of her Beauty his 
                     •
                  ary was ſuddenly changed into as Paſſi

                     •
                  mantium Irae Amoris redintegratio eſt.
               And as a Candle, that is almoſt out, recovers its full light againe, if it be but held downward a litle while: in like manner Love, that is almoſt extinguiſhed, if it bee 
                     •
                  nclined and bent never ſo litle to its Object, it takes fire afreſh.
               Quàm facilè Jrati verbo placantur Amantes?
               Although a Lover rage, &amp; chafe; even now One faire word from his Miſtris ſmooths his brow.
               
                  
And if the party, that is the cauſe of h
                     ••
                   Diſeaſe, be very beautifull: the Preſervatives that are uſed muſt then be the ſtronger. For it is in this caſe, as in the cleaving of Wood: and the Beauty of the Party be loved, as the Axe the Wood, ſeemes i
                     •
                   like manner, as it were, to cleave aſunder the Lovers Heart; and the Sighes are a

                   the Noiſe that followes the Cleaven ſtroke. But, as by doubling the force of the blowes, although the Wood is at length cleft, yet by Reaction the Axe alſo hat
                     •
                   his edge turned, and is ſpilt: In like manner faire Ladies, after that they have perhaps with the force of their Beauty made an entrance into the Hearts of their Lovers, oftimes goe off with a crack in their Honour.
               Some Authors, of no meane note, conſidering the admirable Effects that Beauty worketh, have beene of Opinion, that there was a certaine Tranſmiſſion of Spirits from the body of the perſon beloved into that of the Lover: which did by this meanes produce a Reciprocall and Mutuall Love. And for this cauſe the Roman Ladies of old were wont to weare about

their Neckes a kinde of Wanton Figure, which they called Faſcinum. And perhaps in Imitation of them, the Spaniſh Ladies doe at this day weare a piece of Corall, or Ieat, made in the forme of a Hand cloſed together with the Thumbe 
                     •
                  hruſt out betwixt the Forefinger and the Middlefinger, which they call Higo per no ſer oiadas. The Greekes call all ſuch toies 
                     •
                  s theſe, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : and they were wont to make uſe of them, to the end they might be ſecured from the malice of Envious Perſons.
               The Arabians, ſpeaking of the Cure of Love, doe adviſe us to take Occaſion to diſcourſe of the party that is the cauſe of this diſeaſe, in the hearing of the Patient; and to reckon up all her Imperfections &amp; 
                     ••
                  vices, making them more, &amp; greater then they are; and to ſet forth her vertues alſo in the colours and ſhape of Vices.

                   her, is, in the judgement of thoſe that are more quickſighted, both foule, and deformed. As for example, if ſhe have a handſome noſe, of a reaſonable ſize, and ſome

                     us, for an Argument of a good nature. So likewiſe, if ſhe have a gray ſparkling Eye; ſay then, that ſhe is a foole, luſtfull, inconſtant, and prowd: and then commend as much on the other ſide, with Heſtod, Homer, Pindarus, Iuvenall, and Catullus, thoſe that have black Eyes; taking the ſame courſe in the reſt of her good parts. For the Conditions that are required by the Naturaliſts in an Abſolute Beauty, are ſo many; as that there cannot be found in the whole world a perſon ſo accompliſhed with all the neceſſary circumſtances of Beauty, but that each part will afford ſufficient matter for a Criticall Eye to finde fault with. Which Zeuxis, the famous Painter, knowing right well, and being deſired by the Crotonians to repreſent unto them the beauty of Helen; he would not undertake it, unleſſe they would ſuffer

                   to be moſt excellent.
               Beſides, this Iudgement of Beauty, differs according to the variety of Fancie in the beholders. Ovid would have on faire, and litle: Hector made choice of on that was browne, and of a bigger ſize; for ſo was Andromache.

                   one that is ſtrong: the Spaniard loves a wench that is leane; and the French, one that is ſoft, delicate, and tender: but the Indians, a black one. Hippocrates, and after him, Celſus, commend a tall ſtature, in young people: but diſpraiſe it in old.
               And for this cauſe the Ancient Poets fained, that Beauty was the daughter of Iris and Admiration: becauſe that as the Sun, reflecting upon a watry Cloud, deceaves our Eyes, making us beleeve we ſee diverſe various colours, which are not

there, but only in Appearance: In like manner is Beauty, nothing elſe, but a falſe flaſh of Raies, which dazle our eyes, when it appeares from among the cloudes of ſo great variety of Allurements. Whence we may conclude, that the rareſt and moſt excellent Beauties that are, are not ſuch indeed, as they ſeeme to be; but onely appeare to be ſo, through the ſole defect of the beholders, and through the weakneſſe of their Eyes; who commonly judge that woman to be Beautifull, which is of a white complexion, and ſoft and tender: cleane contrary to the judgement of Galen, who ſaies, that thoſe are the ſignes of a Falſe and Counterfeit Beauty; and that true and Native Beauty conſiſts in the juſt compoſure, and Symmetry of the Parts of the Body, a due proportion of fleſh, &amp; the goodneſſe of the Colour. Now he that deſires to know whether a body be Proportionable, or no, he muſt, according to our Anatomiſts, lay him all along, and cauſe him to extend his armes and legs equally as farre as he is able: and then taking the Navill for the Center, and meaſuring him round about, that part that either goes beyond

                   elſe reacheth it not, is to bee accounted Improportionable. Vitruvius ſaies, that the length of the face from the end of the chinne, to the top of the forehead, is the tenth part of a mans height. If the Body be will ſet, and ſtrong; it is ſeven times as long as the Head; &amp; eight or nine times as long, if the body be ſlender and delicate. The eye-browes joyned together, make up the circle of both the eyes: and ſo is there a certaine proportion in all the reſt of the parts of the Body: as you may read in Equicola, and le ſieur de Ʋeyries, in his Genealogy of Love.
               
               Yet notwithſtanding, the Indians love thoſe that have thicke lips: the Peruvians judge thoſe the moſt beautifull that have great rolling eyes; and the Mexicans thoſe that have litle fore-heads.
               If you cannot perſwade the Lover, and make him confeſſe, that his Miſtreſſe wants theſe Conditions, that are required to an Abſolute Beauty: then muſt you endeavour to deprive her of that Moving beauty, which is called, a Good Grace; and conſiſts in the due Compoſure of the

Members and parts of the whole Body: or elſe of the beauty of the Mind; without which, according to Plato, Plutarch, and Galen, that of the body is nothing worth. And then you may prove to him both by examples, and Authority of good writers, that for the moſt part, thoſe women that are faire, are alſo as Common: as likewiſe thoſe that are unhandſome and deformed, are altogether as troubleſome, and not to be endured: according to that of the Comicke Poet.

               If a man, ſaith he, marry an ugly deformed woman; ſhe muſt needs be quickly loathſome unto him: and he cannot take any delight either to be in her Company, or ſo much as to come into his own houſe. But if he get himſelfe a handſome wife; his neigbours commonly will have as much to doe with her, as himſelfe. So that

Marriage ſeemes to bring along with it unavoideably one of theſe great inconveniences.

               Beauty, and chaſtity ſeldome meet in one perſon. For beauty is as it were a kind of prey, that hath continually a thouſand in chaſe of it. And it is as a ſilent Letter Commendatory alſo of itſelfe,
               (Formoſa facies, muta Commendatio eſt.)
               Which ſeduceth, and over-reacheth the judgement of the beholder, leaving a ſtrong impreſſion behind it. But it is withall as a Letter written upon the Sand, ſoon defaced.

                  Each day blots out ſome of it's beautifull Characters.
               
               But for as much as, in the opinion of all Phyſitians, that have written of the cure of this Malady, it is neceſſary to repreſent

unto the party affected, the foulenes of his errour, and the greatnes of the offence, if he perſiſt obſtinately therein: I would have this great charge left to Divines, who are farre fitter to performe it, then Phyſitians are.
               Yet it ſo fals out oftimes, that theſe admonitions doe not worke any good at all upon them, but rather incenſe them, and make them the more headſtrong and obſtinate in their follies: according to that of the Poet Euripides, as he is cited by Galen.

                     Love's deafe to Counſell. And if you by force
                     Attempt to ſtop, you rather ſpeed it's courſe.
                  
               
               But Plautus goes farther yet, and ſaies that,
               
                  Amor mores hominum moros &amp; moroſos efficit.
                  Minùs placet, magis quod ſuadetur: quod diſuadetur, placet.
                  Cum inopia, cupias: quando copia est, tum non velis.
                  
                     
Ille qui appellit, is compellit: Jlle qui conſuadet, vetat.
                  Inſanum eſt malum, in hospitium devorti ad Cupidinem.
               
               Love is litle better then meere Madneſſe: for they that are poſſeſt with it, are ſo humorſome, and Inconſtant in their deſires, that they know not themſelves, what they would have: what they are perſwaded to, that they cannot endure to heare of: and what they are diſſwaded from, that they make choice of. What is denied them, that they earneſtly deſire: and when 'tis offered them, then they refuſe it. &amp;c. And the reaſon of this diſtemperature in the Mind of a Lover, is, ſaith Ariſtotle, becauſe that he is wholy governed by his Paſſions, which ſtop and hinder all paſſage to his reaſon, which only is able to ſet him againe in the right way to Vertue, from which he is now gone aſtray. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . He that lives, ſaith he, according to his Paſſiōs, wil never hearken to any man that ſhall reprove him, or diſſwade him from it: neither indeed if he

ſhould hearken to it, would he be able to underſtand it. So Tibullus ſware many times, and promiſed his friend, that he would never look upon his Miſtreſſe agen: yet for all that he could not forbeare.
               
                  
                     Iuravi quoties rediturum ad limina nunquam?
                     Cùm benè juravi, pes tamen ipſe redit.
                  
                  
                     Oft have I ſworne, I'de never ſee her more.
                     Yet ſtill my feet betray me to her doore.
                  
               
               The breaking of their oathes in theſe matters, they make no account of at all; preſuming perhaps upon that falſe Opinion that the Heathens held, concerning perjury in Lovers, which they believed the Gods eaſily pardoned in them, as being in that ſtate, like litle fooliſh children, without the uſe either of Iudgement or Reaſon.
               We muſt then, as P. Aegineta, and Avicen adviſe us, watch for a fit oportunity to give them ſome gentle admonitions. For in time, ſaith Galen, Paſſions may weare away: but not alwaies, whenſoever

a man pleaſeth. For it is here, ſaith Chryſippus, juſt as it is with thoſe that runne in plaine ground, who can ſtop themſelves in the midſt of their courſe whenſoever they pleaſe, becauſe that the weight of their own bodies drives them on no farther. But if they take their courſe downe ſome Precipice or ſteep hill; they cannot then ſtop themſelves from falling, when they pleaſe, the weight of their owne bodies ſtill forcing them on farther. So in like manner, when as Reaſon is the cauſe of the motions of the mind; it is an eaſy matter to rule and order them as we liſt: But when either Luſt, or Anger, (Paſſions which are very intractable and unruly, and may therefore be fitly reſembled to the heavineſſe of the body falling downe a Precipice,) joyne their forces together; they cannot ſo eaſily be check't on the ſuddaine, and at pleaſure, but muſt bee gently dealt withall, and corrected by degrees.
               We muſt then watch our opportunity for to fit our ſelyes with this, and all other remedies. For opportunity is the very ſoule and perfection of Phyſique.

               We muſt alſo endeavour, if poſſibly we can, to convert his Love either into late, or Iealouſy, by perſwading him that his Miſtreſſe doth not love him ſo well, 
                     •
                  s ſhe makes him beleive ſhe does; and that all her entermaintments, favours, kiſſes, dalliances and embraces, are only Baites, and Enticements, to keep him in continuall ſlavery: otherwiſe, ſhe would more eaſily and willingly yeild to ſatiſfy his deſires: for that true Love is, to wiſh all good to the party beloved that may cauſe either his contentment or profit, and not their owne only; and ſo likewiſe to be greived and troubled at the evills and afflictions of the perſon they love, more then for their owne.
               And if the party affected with this Malady, be a woman, we may then adde to this, the Diſſembling of men, (which is as frequently found in men, as Inconſtancy is in women;) together with the danger they incurre of ſuffering ſhipwracke in their honour. And therefore Phidias the Painter, intending to intimate as much unto this ſexe, was wont to paint their

Goddeſſe Venus, with her foot upon a Tortoiſe: not ſo much to denote their falſe hood; as ſome have conceived; as to warr them to have a care of their Honour. For the Shee-Tortoiſe in receiving the Male
                     •
                   dares not turne her ſelfe upon her backe, becauſe the Male having enjoyed his pleaſure, would leave her thus, a prey for the Eagle, by reaſon that ſhe is not able to recover her Naturall poſture agen; thus preferring her life and ſafety, before her pleaſure. In like manner ought women to take notice of the danger wherein Men commonly leave them, when they have once enjoyed them: expoſing them, not only to the Eagle, which is the Divell; but alſo to the Crowes, which are the ſlanderers, and ſuch as will be prowd to be the Trumpeters of their Infamy and diſhonour.
               And it is reported by Hiſtorians, that the Mileſian wenches were by this means cured of their Love-Madneſſe. For the Senate having forbidden them to murther themſelves, and threatning them, that if they did, their naked bodies ſhould be expoſed to the open view of all men: they

changed their Minds, and by this meanes were deterred from running mad up and owne the ſtreets, or being their owne Executioners.

                  Gordonius attributes ſo great power &amp; efficacy to this kind of Remedy, or rather Phyſicall ſtratagem; that he conceives that he that cannot be cured of his Malady by this, is to be given over for deſperate, and Incurable: And, to uſe his owne words, ſi ex his amare non dimiſerit; ſanè non eſt homo ſed eſt Diabolus Incarnatus. Fatuitas igitur ſua ſecum ſit in perditione. If this cure him not, (faith he) then he is certainly no man, but a Divell Incarnate: and therefore the Divell take him and his folly too.

               IT is the adviſe of Mercurialis, that for the cure, or prevention of this diſeaſe, the party affected make choice of a cold and moiſtayre to live in. And he wonders very much, that Moſchion, an ancient Greeke Phyſitian, ſhould preſcribe in this caſe, that the chamber of the ſicke perſon ſhould be indifferent hot and light. But

for my owne particular, I ſhould rather chooſe to follow the Adviſe of Avice who in the Prevention of this Malad

               He muſt alſo drinke water, and no wind upon any tearmes: becauſe that wine inflames the blood, and makes men the more prone to luſt; as Ariſtotle ſaies: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . And therefore the Poets feigne, that Priapus was the ſonne of Bacchus. And the ancient Law makers did

ordaine, by the lawes of twelve Tables, the ſame puniſhment for a woman that

                  runke wine, as for an Adultereſſe.
               Yet Gordon allowes the Lover to drink wine, and that too, not in a very ſmall quantity, nor yet ſo much as will make him drunke: notwithſtanding Ovid ſaies the contrary.

               Wine, ſaith he, taken moderately, raiſeth the ſpirits, and provokes a deſire of 
                     Ʋenery: but if it be drunke in great abundance, it then workes the contrary effect and takes away all ſuch thoughts. And he proves it by the inſtance of fire, which i

                   if you blow it gently: whereas, on the other ſide, a rough boiſterous blaſt quite extinguiſheth it. And therefore hee concludes, that either of the Extreams, either to forbeare utterly, or elſe to drinke it in exceſſe, is very ſafe: but the Meane carries all the danger in it.
               I could be content to give a Poet free leave to maintaine ſo licentious a Poſition as this is: But that a Platonick Philoſopher, Marſilius Ficinus by name, ſhould adviſe, for the cure of this Malady, to be Drunke now and then, that ſo there may be new blood and ſpirits bred, for to ſupply the defects of the blood and ſpirits that are Infected by this diſeaſe of Love; and ſo by this meanes to cure one vice by a greater,

ſeems to me to be a doctrine not only Impious, but alſo very dangerous too. But for confutation of Ficinus, I ſhall only put the reader in mind of the example of Lots inceſt, and the cauſe thereof.
               We adviſe then, that the Patient drink water, inſteed of wine, that ſo by litle and litle

                  ; as Hippocrates ſaies, the habit and diſpoſition of the body may be altered by degrees to a contrary ſtate. Or elſe, which will be much better, let them accuſtome themſelves to faſt often, and feed on bread and water. For, as the Poet Achaus ſaies,

               Love takes not up his lodging in an Empty belly. But contrarily, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : 
                     Ʋenus delights in Fulneſſe and variety of dainties. Eſpecially if the party affected be in good plight, and high fed, and of a ſanguine, or Cholerick complexion. For in this caſe, all his meats muſt be but very litle nutritive; but rather Refrigerative

and of a cooling quality. And therefore ye muſt give him in his broaths, and ſalads, Purſlane, Sorrell, Endive, Succory, and Lettuce, which is ſo ſoveraigne a Remedy againſt this Malady, that Venus, deſiring to forget all her unchaſt deſires, buried her deare Adonis, under a bed of Lettuce. Some Phyſitians preferre the Seed before the Leafe. Or elſe we may uſe conſerves of red Roſes, or Province Roſes; which are ſaid to be very effectuall in theſe caſes. The ſame vertue doe they alſo attribute to Mints: not ſo much becauſe they coole, as Ariſtotle, Pliny, Magnimus, Arnaldus de Villa Nova, and diverſe others have thought, being moved thereto, becauſe that perhaps they had obſerved out of Hippocrates, that Mints doe take away all Venereall deſires: but rather for that they diſperſe and conſume the ſeed, if a man uſe to eate it often: as the ſame Hippocrates, lib. 2. de Diaeta affirmes: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Which makes me ſuſpect, that that place of Ariſtotle is corrupted, and that in ſtead of 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   which ſignifies to coole, it ſhould

be read, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that is, to conſume by diſſolving, or melting. But the Poets doe fabulouſly referre this vertue, that is found to be in Mints, to a certaine Nymph forſooth, called Mentha, daughter to Cocytus, one of the Infernall Rivers, and beloved of Pluto: who comming to the knowledge that Pluto was fallen in Love with Proſerpine, the daughter of Ceres, the Goddeſſe of Plants and Corne; ſhee made her boaſts, that ſhee her ſelfe farre ſurpaſſed Proſerpine for beauty, and withall threatned to raiſe rebellion againſt Pluto, if he offered to bring her into his Subterranean Dominions. But Ceres, being informed hereof, ſhe obtained of Iupiter, that this Nymph ſhould be transformed into an Hearbe of that name, with this Curſe alſo upon her, that ſhe ſhould ever be accounted an Enemy to Loves Myſteries.
               Yet Avicen holds the contrary opinion to that of Hippocrates and Ariſtotle, affirming that it is of a nature contrary to the Prevention and Cure of Love: which is alſo the opinion of Paulus Aegineta, Aetius, Dioſcorides, and many others.

But theſe contrarieties of opinion in theſe learned Authors, may, as I conceive, be eaſily reconciled, if we ſay, that according to the doctrine of Hippocrates and Ariſtotle, Mints are contrary to the motions of Love, when it is cauſed by Humid Repletion: for in this caſe, dry meats and Medicines are very hurtfull, as we may collect out of Avicen, cap. 28. &amp; 29. Lib. 3. Fen. 20. tr. 1. But if the complexion of the party affected be Hot, and full of Seroſities, and ſharpe and ſalt Humours, Mints are then very hurtfull, according to the opinion of Aegineta, Aëtius, and Avicen.

browne bread, or bread made of Rie, Barley, Millet, or Spelt, (which Quercetanus, in his Treaſure of Health, miſtakes for a kind of Wheat without any beard; becauſe that Spelt corne is called Zea generally by all our Herbaliſts:) which is but a hungry kind of graine, that yeelds ſomewhat more nouriſhment then Barley, and a great deale leſſe then Wheat. They muſt alſo ſometimes uſe to take Hempe-ſeed, or Agnus Caſtus, (both which ſeeds Galen reckons among Aliments) Rue, Cummin, or Corianderſeed: and let them have in their ſauces Vineger, juyce of Lemons, Orenges, Sorrell, Verdejuyce, and the like. But they muſt be ſure to take heed of all manner of Aromaticall things, and all fried or ſalt meats: becauſe that Salt, by reaſon of its Heat and Acrimony, provokes to luſt thoſe that uſe to eate it in any great quantity. And for this cauſe the Aegyptian Prieſts were wont to abſtaine from all manner of Salt meats, having found by experience, that ſalt things doe cauſe a kind of Itching or Tickling in thoſe parts that ſerve for Generation. And therefore the Rhodians, as

                  , which is as much as to ſay, Borne of Salt, or of the Sea: intimating unto us, by this Poeticall fiction, the generative vertue of Salt, which is indeed very great. And this is the reaſon that Fiſhes are more fruitfull, and multiply faſter, then any other living creatures whatſoever. And we ſee that veſſells of ſalt commonly produce great ſtore of Mice: the Female conceaving without a Male, meerely by licking of the ſalt: if we may believe Ariſtotle. In like manner we ſee that Sheapheards uſually give ſalt to their ſheepe &amp; goats; and Huntſmen likewiſe to their doggs; by giving them fleſh powdered a long time in pickle: for to raiſe and awaken in them their Generative Faculty, when it is in a manner quite dulled and dead in them. Which makes me apt to thinke, that this word Salacitas, which ſignifies an earneſt deſire and appetite to Carnall Copulation, is derived from Sal, ſignifying Salt; and ſometimes alſo Beauty, or Gracefulneſſe according to that of the Poet.
               
                  
Nec eſt in tanto corpore mica Salis.
               Our Patient muſt abſtaine alſo from all meats that are very Nutritive, Hot, Flatulent, and Melancholy: as ſoft Egges, Partridges, Pigeons, Sparrowes, Quailes, Hare; and eſpecially greene Geeſe, by reaſon of ſome certaine ſecret properties that are attributed unto them by Magnimus and Arnaldus de Villa nova: which I would have to be underſtood of the Liver only, which is indeed very nouriſhing: and which the Romans, as Athenaeus ſaith, made more account of, then of all the other parts of the fleſh: it being moſt certaine, that the fleſh of a Gooſe is very hard of digeſtion, and abounds in Excrements, all ſave only the wings, as Galen affirmes in his lib. 3. de Alimentis.
               
               He muſt alſo take heed that he doe not uſe to eate often Pine-nuts, Piſtachoes, ſmall Nuts, Cives, Artichokes, Coleworts, Rapes, Carrots, Parſnips, green Ginger, Eringoes, Satyrion, Onions, Waternuts, Rocket, &amp;c.

               Oyſters alſo, Cheſtnuts, Ciche peaſe, (which Pliny for this reaſon calls, venerea) and all ſuch like meats.
               The Alterative Medicines, that are of the like quality, are farre more dangerous then Meats are: as the ſeed of the Roman, or Red Nettle, Aſh-keys, the leaves of Wood-bine, the true Scinkes (which, according to Rondeletius, are Land Crocodiles,) Diaſatyrion, Triphera Saracenica, Diazinziber, and ſuch like powders and Opiates, as you may finde them reckond up by Avicen, Nicholas Monardes, Scrapion, Meſue, Andernacus, Arnaldus, Matthaeus Gradeus, Rhaſis, and other Authenticke Authors.
               Now as the uſe of any of theſe Medicaments above ſpecified is very dangerous; So doe I conceive that Idleneſſe is much more. And therefore we ſhall doe very well to take care that our Patient be alwaies in ſome ſerious Imployment or other,

               Whether it be in Warlike Actions, or Hunting, Study, or Husbandry. And therefore the Poets feigne, that Cupid could never prevaile againſt 
                     Ʋeſta, Pallas, or Diana, notwithſtanding that he had triumphed over all the reſt, both Gods and Goddeſſes: Intimating by this fiction, that thoſe that place their delight, and are alwaies imployed either in the ſtudy of Learning, Hunting, or Husbandry, are not ſubject to the power of Love. And therefore let him be ſure in the firſt place to avoide Idleneſſe, as being both the Cauſe and Fuell too of Loves flames.

                  Avicen, in his Chapter de Amore, Gordonius, Arnaldus de Ʋilla Nova, and many
 other moderne Phyſitians, are of opinion, that the beſt way to preſerve one, that is but newly fallen in Love, from this diſeaſe of Erotique Melancholy, is, to endeavour by all meanes poſſible to divert his thoughts from his Former Miſtreſſe, by making him fall in Love with another: whom when he once beginnes to be affected with; they muſt then make him hate this, and fall in love with a third: following this courſe with him ſtill, till at length he begins of his own accord to bee weary of being in Love. For as Ariſtotle ſaies, he that hath many Friends, hath never a one: in like manner doe I ſay, that he that is in Love with many women at once, will never run mad for any of them. And this, Gordonius confeſſeth that he learnt of the wanton Poët Ovid, whoſe adviſe this is.

                     Let each man have two Miſtreſſes in ſtore:
                     And 'twere much better, if he could have more.
                     
                        
Thus, whilſt the mind 'twixt two it ſelfe doth ſhare,
                     One Love will ſtill each others force impaire.
                  
               
               For the Minde being thus divided, the deſires are the leſſe violent; and ſo one love takes away the force of the other.
               But this opinion of theirs, (under correction of ſo learned men) I cannot approve of: conſidering that it is to bee feared, that either we ſhall not be able to remove his Love at our pleaſure: (which Avicen alſo ſeems to grant, when he ſaies that if we cannot bring it to paſſe our ſelves, we muſt employ ſome old woman about the effecting of it:) or if wee doe take him off from his firſt Love, and commend a ſecond to him, he may happily fix there too firmely, and be as much perplexed with this, as with the firſt Love. Beſides, I my ſelfe have known diverſe perſons, who by this meanes have gotten ſo ill a Habit, as they could not chooſe but fall in love with all women Indifferently, that would but ſeeme to entertaine their Love: and as often as they came in

company where women were, their behaviour was ſo ridiculous, that a man would have taken them to bee arrant Fooles, notwithſtanding all their other Actions were very diſcreet, and ſuch as might become the wiſeſt Men. For all Paſſions, that are of any long continuance, doe imprint ill Habits in the Mind; which by length of time growing ſtronger, are very hard to be removed, and are apt to be ſtirred up at every the leaſt occaſiō. An experience of this you may have in cowards, who oftimes are afraid even of thoſe that come for their reſcue and protection: and in Cholerick men, who many times fall out with their friends. So likewiſe thoſe Men, that are prone to unchaſt Love, cannot content themſelves with the Love of any one, but apply themſelves to all indifferently. For Cuſtome, which is, as it were, another Nature, being once growne up into a Habit, hath a wonderfull power in diſpoſing the minde to that which is familiar unto it. And as a ſtumbling horſe is apt to trip at every ſtone that lies in his way; So he that hath contracted ſuch an Amorous Diſpoſition, is in love with every

one he ſees. And when he is once thus affected, he doth not then what he would, but what his Paſſion prompts him to: luſt as a bowle, when it is once ſet a going, neceſſarily turnes round, and cannot ſtay it ſelfe, by reaſon of it's circular figure, ſo apt to Motion. Dum ſervitur Libidini, facta eſt Conſuetudo: &amp; dum Conſuetudini non reſiſtitur, facta eſt Neceſſitas: ſaith S. Auguſtine; while a Man indulgeth his owne Iuſtfull deſires, it growes at length into a Cuſtome: and this Cuſtome meeting no reſiſtance, becomes at laſt a kind of Neceſſity.
            
            
               CAP. XXXI. Chirurgicall Remedies for the Prevention of Love, and Erotique Melancholy.
               
               FOr as much as the ſeed is the joynt, Immediate cauſe of this Diſeaſe, as Galen proves at large by diverſe both Arguments and Examples, toward the end

of his lib. 6. de loc. Affect. and ſeeing that the ſeed is nothing elſe but Blood, made White by the Naturall Heat, and an Excrement of the third Digeſtion, which provokes Nature either by its quantity, or quality to evacuate it; which otherwiſe would corrupt within the body, and ſo by ſending up divers noyſome vapours to the Braine by the Back-bone, &amp; other paſſages, would diſturbe and hinder the operation of its cheifeſt Faculties: It ſeemes to bee very neceſſary in the firſt place to take away the ſuperfluity of Blood, by opening the Liver Veine in the right arme. And if the party be of a good Conſtitution, Sanguine, and well in fleſh, you may take the greater quantity from him; becauſe that their ſtrength will bee able to beare the loſſe of the greater ſtore of Blood. And you may reiterate it, two or three times in a yeare, ſo long as there is any danger of this Diſeaſe remaining: eſpecially if you finde that this courſe would have been good to have been taken with the Patientat the firſt. After the Liver Veine hath been opened, I would adviſe to take ſome quantity of Blood, accordingly

as the Age and ſtrength of the Patient would beare it, from the Hamme Veine: eſpecially if the party be troubled with the Satyriaſis, and the Phyſitian find himſelfe able enough to doe this. Or in ſtead of this, I would open the Saphena, or Ankle Veine: or elſe apply Couping glaſſes upon his thigh neere to the privy parts, having firſt made ſufficient Scarification. But he muſt not come to theſe particular Evacuations, unleſſe the Veine in the Arme were firſt opened: which in caſe of the Satyriaſis, or Vterine Fury, I would have to bee done the firſt day. For otherwiſe this would bee a meanes rather to attract and draw down more Blood to thoſe parts, which are both the cauſe and ſeat of the diſeaſe, then to draw it away. Some uſe Cauteriſmes on the Legs: but I doe not approve of this courſe, but rather take it to be vaine, and of litle or no force at all. The Scythians, as Herodotus reports, were wont to cut the Veines behind their Eares, and ſo by this meanes made them 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   Impotent, and weake: and having brought downe themſelves to this baſe

dejected ſtate, they took upon them the habit of Women, and ſpun with them too: as Hippocrates relates: for as the ſame Author affirmes, lib. de Aëre, Loc. &amp; Aqu. the cutting of thoſe Veines or Arteries that joyne cloſe to the Eares, makes the perſons ſo cut, Impotent, and unapt for Generation. Notwithſtanding Veſalius, and ſome other Anatomiſts will have this defect to proceed rather from the cutting of the Nerves of the Sixth Conjugation, which paſſing along by the eares, are terminated in the Genitals, and Spermaticall Veſſels.
               This remedy being ſo eaſie, might alſo ſeeme very uſefull for all thoſe that have taken upon them the Vow of Perpetuall Chaſtity: but that there ſeemes to bee ſome danger in it of hurting the Memory and Iudgement: as may be collected out of Avicen, and is confirmed alſo by the example of the Scythians before mentioned; who, by this Chirurgicall experiment made upon themſelves, became ſtarke Fooles and Idiots.
            
            
               
               CHAP. XXXII. Medicinall Remedies for the Prevention of Love, or Erotique Melancholy.
               
               THE firſt Medicinall remedy ſhall be a Clyſter, compoſed of cooling and moyſtening Ingredients: among which it will doe well to mixe Hemp ſeed, Agnus Castus, and the like. And the next day after, you ſhall give him a ſufficient quantity of Caſſia, Catholicon, Diaprum, or Tryphera Perſica, with a litle Agnus Caſtus: or elſe a very gentle Purge: for wee muſt not in this caſe uſe any violent Purgation, or which would make the body over Laxative: as both Avicen, and Aëtius are of opinion, who to this purpoſe preſcribes the Decoction of Betes, Mallows, or the hearbe Mercury. For all violent Medicaments doe heat the Humours, and inrage the Blood, driving downe the Excrements toward the Inferiour parts, and

Spermaticall Veſſels. And for this reaſon Arnaldus de Villa Nova, cap. de Regim. Caſt. Ʋivent. preferres Vomits, in this caſe, before Purging.
               Then let the party take every morning a litle milke, or elſe ſome broath, or Iulip that may refreſh the blood: uſing alſo ſome Medicinall drinke, which is of a contrary nature to the generation of ſeed: eſpecially if the party be of a moyſt complexion: for, for ſuch perſons, theſe kinde of Medicines are very good, as Avicen ſaith.
               This Medicine I commonly uſe.

               Sometimes alſo I adde hereto ſome few graines of Camphire: or elſe I temper it with water of Lettice, Purſlane, or water-Lillies: and ſo give it him to drinke

for ſome certaine Mornings: eſpecially the party affected be of a Hot and Cholerick conſtitution. For, as Dioſcorides ſaith theſe hearbs are very powerfull and efficacious for the Prevention and cure of this Malady.
               The Athenian Prieſts were wont to take Hemlocke for this purpoſe: notwithſtanding that it was the Ordinary poyſon that the Areopagites uſed to put Malefactors to death withall: as we may obſerve out of Plato. And S. Baſil, (who is reported to have been as well an excellent Phyſitian, as a Divine,) affirmes that hee had ſeen women, that have quite extinguiſhed all their unchaſt Heats, meerely by drinking of hemlock. But we muſt take heed that we uſe not any Diureticall Medicines, &amp; that for the reaſon before alleadged concerning Purgation. Beſides, all ſuch Medicaments are commonly Hot and Dry, except they be qualified with a litle quantity of milke and water, which may temper their Heat. For Mercurialis affirmes, that hee hath cured women of this Love-Madneſſe, by theſe remedies only. Or elſe let them uſe this.

               And if there be any danger of Ventoſity, as there may very well be in ſuch perſons as are of a Melancholy conſtitution: then you ſhall uſe Decoctions, Iulips, or Oyntments, and the like; rather then cooling Simples.
               After that he hath taken theſe drinkes, it would not be amiſſe, to purge him, with thoſe Medicines above ſet downe; or elſe with Rhubarbe, &amp; ſirupe of Roſes, or with the ſirupe of Succory, compounded with Rhubarbe.
               But methinkes it is a very Ridiculous conceit of Arnaldus Ʋillanovanus, where he ſaies, that there is no better way in the world to ſecure a man from this Diſeaſe, then to carry about him a knife, with a haft made of the wood of Agnus Caſtus.
               
               It is alſo very good to bath the privy members in Vineger, the juyce of Morell,

Plantaine, Hipwort, Houſe leeke, or the like liquors: eſpecially if the party doe no marry. But for my part I conceive, that a
                     •
                   there is leſſe danger in bathing ones ſelf in cold water, ſo perhaps there might n

Yet muſt there be great heed taken, as Aegineta ſaith, leaſt while we are ſo carefull of cooling the Privy parts and loynes, the reines doe not ſuffer too much by it. There is alſo great danger of ſtopping the courſe of their monethly Tearmes in Women and Virgins; if ſo bee that theſe Stupefactive and cooling Medicaments bee uſed too frequently. And therefore, leaſt that avoyding

one inconvenience, we fall into a greater, we muſt take heed of giving women

                  eynes, Loynes, and the parts adjoining, adviſeth to bath the forehead and Temples alſo with Oxyrhodeum; eſpecially if there be any danger of Madneſſe, Vterine Fury, or Erotique Melancholy.
               If it ſhould ſeeme to bee ſomewhat dangerous for the patient to have theſe Oyntments, Cere-cloathes, or cooling Fomentations aplied unto him: you ſhall doe well then to gird him about with a thin plate of lead; to which both Galen, Avicen, Aegineta, Andreas Laurentius, and all our moderne Phyſitians attribute great vertue in this caſe. But they muſt take heed that hee weare it not too long, for feare it may offend the Reines. Beſides all theſe Remedies already ſet downe,

                  Arnaldus de Villa-Nova addes yet another, the uſe whereof he commends to a

ſomething a diſputable buſineſſe, whether or no the names are obſcene and diſhoneſt, when as the Parts themſelves that are ſignified by them, are not ſo, but are Naturall, uſefull, and neceſſary: and of which alſo we oftentimes make publicke diſſections and demonſtrations, and diſcourſe openly of their ſubſtance, number, figure ſituation, connexion, Actions, and uſe.

But this is not the only trifling deviſe, that is to bee found in that booke of his, de Ʋenenis. But if this ſhould be true, which yet I am very apt to ſuſpect, we muſt attribute this effect to ſome certaine Occult quality: to which wee muſt alſo referre the vertue which both he, and diverſe other Phyſitians doe impute to the Carbuncle, Saphire, Emerauld, and Iaspir ſtones, for the preſerving a main

from Love-Melancholy, if he weare any of theſe precious ſtones on the Ring-finger of his left hand.
            
            
               CAP. XXXIII. The cure of Erotique Melancholy, and Love. Madneſſe.
               
               
                  DIogenes going one day to the Oracle at Delphos, to aske counſell, what was the moſt ſoveraigne and ſpeedieſt Remedy for the cure of his ſonne, that was growne mad for Love: received this anſwere, that he muſt enjoy Her, that was the cauſe of his Madneſſe. The ſame counſell did Ionadab give to Amnon, who doated on his ſiſter Thamar; Hippocrates, to King Perdicca's ſonne: and Eraſiſtratus, to Antiochus, King Seleucus his ſonne. This opinion is alſo ſet downe in expreſſe tearmes by Hippocrates, about the end of his booke De his quae ad Virgin. spect. thus: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                  
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . My adviſe is, ſaith he, that all young wenches, when once they begin to bee taken with this diſeaſe, ſhould preſently bee married out of hand. The ſame is the opinion of Galen alſo, toward the end of thoſe excellent bookes of his, which he compoſed in his old age, de Locis Affect, as alſo of Avicen, Haly Abbas, Gordonius, Arnaldus, Ʋaleſcus de Tarenta, Pereda, Lucretius, Ficinus, Ovid, and many others.
               But the enjoyment of their Deſires doth not cure this diſeaſe alone; but even the very power, or Liberty to enjoy them, doth oftimes worke the ſame effect: according to that of the Poet.
               
                  Jlli, peccandi ſtudium, permiſſa poteſtas
                  Abſtulit; at
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      ipſum talia velle ſubit.
               
               And ſometimes alſo a bare dreame doth the like: as may appeare by that ſtory of a certaine young Aegyptian, that was extreamely in love with one Theognis, related by Plutarch. This young Inamorato prevailed ſo farre with this wench, that at the laſt ſhe conſented to ſatisfy his deſires,

upon condition that hee would give her a certaine ſumme of Money: which he very readily condeſcended unto. It fortuned in the meane time, that as this luſty youth one night lay aſleep in his bed, hee dream't that he embrac'd in his armes his beloved Theognis: and his Fancy was ſo ſtrong upon him, that hee conceived himſelfe to enjoy her really, in the height of Amorous dalliance: and was indeed by this meanes cured of his Malady. Which the Damſell coming to have notice of, ſhe demands her ſalary of him: and upon his refuſall to pay it, ſhe ſues him in the court of Iuſtice, alleadging for the reaſon of this her proceeding, that ſhe had performed the conditions on her part required, in that ſhe had cured him of his diſeaſe. Which when the Iudge heard, he commanded the young man, that hee ſhould bring into the Court the ſumme of mony agreed upon betwixt them, and there powre it out into a Baſon: and withall decreed, that as the Aegyptian had contented himſelfe with a bare Imaginary Pleaſure, conceived in the enjoyment of Her body: in like manner ſhould ſhe bee

ſatisfyed with the ſound and colour of his gold. This ſentence of the Iudge was approved of by all, ſave only the Damſell: who objected againſt it, that the dreame had quenched the Aegyptians deſire: but on the contrary, the ſound and colour of the gold had encreaſed Hers the more; and that therefore this ſentence was unjuſt.
               And here before wee either approve, or reject this Remedy, we muſt diſtinguiſh this enjoyment into two kindes, either Lawfull, or Vnlawfull. Now there is no Phyſitian, that ever denyed to his Patient, for the cure of his Love-Madneſſe, the enjoyment of the perſon he loved, ſo it were in marriage lawfully concluded on of all ſides: conſidering that, as the Poet ſaies.
               Amoris vulnus, idem qui facit, ſanat.
               The wounds of Love, are cured only by that hand that made them.

                  Avicen, in his chapter de Amore, ſaies, that this is the only, and laſt remedy that we muſt have recourſe unto. Ampliùs cùm non invenitur cura, niſi regimen coniunctionis inter eas, ſecundùm modum permiſſionis fidei &amp; legis, fiat. Et nos quidem iam vidimus, cuireddita eſt ſalus, &amp; virtus, &amp; rediit ad carnem ſuam, cùm iam perveniſſet ad arefactionem, &amp; pertranſiſſetipſam, &amp; telleraſſet Aegritudines pravas, antiquas, &amp; febres longas, propter debilitatem virtutis, factam propter nimietatem Iliſci. And he profeſſes that himſelfe hath ſeen ſome, that have been recovered by this meanes, when as through the extreamity of this Love-Melancholy, they have been grown leane and dry, and have had ſcarce any fleſh left on their backes, and through weakneſſe and faintneſſe have beene brought into cruell Inveterate diſeaſes, &amp; Feavers of long continuance. But in caſe that Marriage cannot be accompliſhed betwixt the parties, by reaſon of any Impediments on either part: I dare not bee ſo impious as to preſcribe for the cure of our Patient, as Avicen, and Haly Abbas doe, Emptionem puellarum, &amp; plurimum concubitum
                  
                  ipſarum: &amp; earum renovationem, &amp; delectationem cum ipſis. And yet I doe not marvaile at all, that theſe Mahometans ſhould embrace this ſo wicked an opinion: conſidering that their Alcoran permits them to have as many wives, and Concubines, as they are able to maintaine: as wee are aſſured by the relation of all thoſe that have written of the cuſtomes, and manners of the Turkes, and other Mahometans. Neither yet doe I wonder at Ovid, and Lucretius among the Poets, who made a vertue of Luxury, and Incontinency. But this opinion is moſt vile, and execrable in the mouth of Chriſtians, that would ſeeme to maintaine it: ſuch as were Arnaldus de villa Nova, Magnimus, Valeſcus de Tarenta, Pereda, Marſilius Ficinus, and ſome others. But I leave this queſtion to be diſputed by Divines, whether or no Fornication bee lawfull: and whether wee may doe Ill, that Good may come of it: And ſhall only for mine owne part believe, as the Morall Philoſophers teach us, that Vice is never cured by Vice, but by Vertue, as by it's contrary: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : For Contraries

are cured by Contraries; as I ſhall be able to prove unto you out of Ariſtotle: and ſhall ſhew you withall, that thoſe perſons that take this lewd courſe to cure themſelves of this Malady; inſtead of being cured, they rather grow farre worſe, and much more inclined to Luſt, and all unchaſt deſires. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . For by this meanes, ſaith he, the paſſages of the body are opened &amp; made more capacious, &amp; the ſpermaticall veſſels are enlarged: and withall, the Remembrance of thoſe ſweet pleaſures they have formerly enioyed, begets in them a ſtrong deſire to act them over againe. This doctrine Ariſtotle ſeemes to have derived from Hippocrates, who diſcourſeth of this point, almoſt in the very ſame tearms; 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . For, ſaith he, if a man doe exerciſe the Acts of Venery very frequently; his Veines by this meanes grow larger; and ſo attracting the greater ſtore of ſeed, he is a great deale the more prone to 
                     Ʋenery.
                  
                  Galen alſo is of the ſame opinion; and proves it by that excellent and true Maxime of the divine Plato in Theaeteto; where he ſaies, that Jgnavia quidem exſolvit: proprii autem officii exercitatio, robur anget. Idleneſſe, and want of exerciſe, deſtroyes the ſtrength: but labour, and often uſing of a mans ſtrength, increaſes it. And this hee confirmes alſo by the inſtance of Womens breaſts, which breed the greater quantity of milke in them, the oftner they are ſucked. But on the contrary ſide, ſaith he, Cantatoribus, &amp; Athletis, qui iam inde ab initio nullam vitae partem Ʋeneris illecebris contaminaverunt, nullam admittentes Ʋenereorum cogitationem, vel Imaginationem; iis Pudenda exilia, &amp; rugoſa, veluti ſenibus, ſieri conſueverunt, nulla
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      libidine tentantur. Which place, I hold to be very wel worhty the conſideration of all thoſe that have taken upon thē the vow of Chaſtity. Beſides, if the contrary opinion of thoſe Authours above named were true: it muſt needs then follow, that thoſe perſons that are married, ſhould never feele the force of any of theſe unchaſt Heats of Luſt: notwithſtanding experience proves the contrary.

And this hath moved even ſome of the Ancient Fathers to confeſſe, that it was a harder matter for a man to preſerve his Chaſtity, then his Virginity.
            
            
               CAP. XXXIV. Remedies for the Cure of Love-Melancholy in Married perſons.
               
               IT is often ſeen, that Married perſons, whether they have been joyned together by their own good liking and choice, and without any conſtraint on either ſide; or elſe perhaps againſt the conſent of the one or the other; doe at length conceave a ſecret hate againſt one another, which occaſioneth betwixt them ſuch diſcord, malice, and neglect, that they cannot endure the company of one another: but preſently yeeld up themſelves to the embraces of ſome new Loves, whom they entertaine with all fervency and ſtrength of deſire, notwithſtanding the unlawfullneſſe

of this their fowle and lewd manner of living. The cauſe of this, is diverſe for it is ſometimes either the Diſſimil
                     •
                   tude of Manners; or elſe a ſecret Antipa
                     •
                  
                  thy in their diſpoſitions: ſometimes alſo ſome Imperfection either of body of mind in one of the parties. Sometimes it is cauſed by ſome Charme, or Inchantment; or elſe perhaps a Iealouſy, or conceit that they have, that their Love is not requited with mutuall Love againe. And ſometimes alſo it is cauſed through the want of that Pleaſure that Nature hath in great meaſure beſtowed on the Genitall parts in the Act of Copulation, by the means of thoſe Nerves which are placed in them, and the Serous ſharpe pricking Humour that is reſerved within certaine Kernels in the neck of the bladder.
               For the cure of this Naturall defect, I ſhall deſire you to have recourſe to Marinello de Vigo, Avicen, and others, &amp; eſpecially Liebault in his firſt book of the diſeaſes of Women, and 35 chapter: where he ſets downe the meanes that muſt be uſed, for the reconcilement and bringing together againe of new married perſons,

that hate and fly the company of each other. And here by the way you are to take notice, that as there are ſome Men that are Cold and Impotent: ſo are there likewiſe ſome Women too, that feele no motions of the fleſh at all. Platerus in his Obſervations makes mention of two in this kind, who were for this reaſon alwaies Barren. Of this conſtitution was Amaſis, King of Egypt; as Herodotus reports: and Theodoricus, King of France, is reported by Paulus Aemilius to have been Impotent toward his Wife, but not toward his Concubines. The ſame is recorded alſo in the Annals of Aragon, and by Dupreau, in the yeare 1196. of Peter the Second, King of Aragon: which the Quen being advertiſed of, ſhe went one night, and lay in one of the Kings concubines beds, and was got with child that night, and afterward delivered of Iames, who was afterwards King: and ſo by this meanes and ſubtle device of the Queenes, the King was brought to ſee his errour, and ever after abſtained from his unchaſt Loves.

               Wherein were wrought all the deſires, graces, perſwaſions, baites, and allurements required to the confirmation of love betwixt man and wife.
               If either of the parties have any defect in their perſon, which may ſeeme to have been the cauſe of the others neglect; they muſt then endeavour to repaire it by all convenient remedies. Or if this be impoſſible to be done; they muſt then ſtrive to recompence this defect of body, by the beauty of their mind.

beheld him, not ſo much for his long golden Haire; for Euphorbus had a fairer

                  ead of Haire then he: but becauſe that

                     But where two equall minds, and chaſt deſires
                     Doe meet; theſe kindle never-dying fires.
                  
               
               And if there be any ſecret Antipathy betwixt them, they muſt yet ſtill pretend ſome ſhew of love the one to the other: for it may ſo come to paſſe, that this feigned Love may in time convert to true reall Love. It is reported of one Caelius in Rome, that, to avoid the Attendance on ſome great perſon in the Emperours Court, counterfeited himſelfe to be grievouſly troubled with the Gout, applying all thoſe ordinary remedies that are preſcribed for the cure of this diſeaſe: Till at length Fortune did him the favour to ſend him the Gout in earneſt. Of whom Martiall hath this witty Epigram.
               
                  
                     Tantum cura potest, &amp; ars doloris.
                     Deſiit fingere Caelius Podagram.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        Caelius now feignes not. (ſee what Art can doe!)
                     He that before would not, now cannot goe.
                  
               
               
                  Appian alſo makes mention of another, who in a jeering way counterfeiting blindneſſe in another, within a ſhort ſpace became blind himſelfe. Love muſt be anſwered with Love againe. Monſtrabo tibi Amatorium ſine Medicamento, ſine ullius Veneficae carmine. Si vis amari, ama. ſaies Seneca. I will ſhew thee a way how to procure love, without either Philter, or Charme: If thou wouldſt be Loved, doe thou firſt love. Themiſtius, and Porphyrius have a pleaſant fiction to this purpoſe, which is this. As one day 
                     Ʋenus, having perceaved that her ſonne Cupid did not thrive at all, went to conſult with the Goddeſſe Themis concerning the reaſon of it; ſhe receaved this anſwere: that Cupid could not recover a perfect ſtate, and ſtrength of body, unleſſe he had a Brother, which muſt be called Anteros, or Reciprocall Love, for the mutuall aſſiſtance of each other. Anteros was no ſooner borne,

but preſently Cupid began to grow, and ſpread forth his wings; and ſo long as Anteros was in preſence, he appeared both greater, and much more beautifull: but in his Abſence he ſeemed alwaies to diminiſh, and abate both in ſtrength and beauty. So that by this fiction is intimated of how great force and vertue, honeſt Embraces, kind words, and courteous entertainements are, for the continuance and encreaſing of mutuall Love. And for this cauſe the Ancients, as Plutarch reports, were wont to give the Bride a Quince to eate, on the wedding day.
               
                  Nam facit ipſa ſuis interdum foemina factis,

               It often comes to paſſe, ſaies this old Poet, that a woman, by her applying her ſelfe to the humours and conditions of her Husband, and by her neatneſſe, and comely attiring of her ſelfe, tempers the roughneſſe and harſhneſſe of his diſpoſition; and ſo by this meanes they enjoy

each other very peaceably and Lovingly.
               
                  Philoſtratus reports, that the eating of Hares fleſh, was accounted of great vertue among the Romans, for the maintaining of Mutuall Love and amity betwixt married perſons, and to divert their minds from thinking on any ſtrange loves. And this cuſtome was grounded perhaps on a certaine opinion, that, as Pliny ſaies, they had, that the fleſh of a Hare makes thoſe that eate it comely, and of a gratious aſpect. And hereto Martiall ſeemes to allude, when he writes to Gellia thus.
               
                  
                     Si quando Leporem mittis mihi, Gellia, Mandas,
                  
                  
                     Formoſus ſeptem, Marce, diebus eris.
                  
                  
                     Si non derides, ſi verum, Gellia, mandas:
                  
                  
                     Ediſti nunquam, Gellia, tu Leporem.
                  
               
               
                  Gellia, when ere thou ſend'ſt to me a Hare, Thou bidſt me eate it, and I ſhall be faire Seven daies. If this be true, as thou doſt ſay:
               Thou never eatſt a Hare, good Gellia.
               
               
                  
                  Ariſtotle commends for this uſe the fiſ
                     •
                   called Remora, by the Latines; and by the Greekes 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : and ſaies that they were wont to uſe it in their Philters. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : which place of Ariſtotle is thus tranſlated by Pliny: Echineis, Amatoriis beneficiis infamis, Iudiciorum, &amp; litium mora. Which opinion of the Ancients ſeems to me in all probability to have been grounded on a certain fable that they have, how that ſuch a Fiſh
                     •
                   ſhould ſtop the ſhip of Perianders Embaſſadors, whom he had ſent to geld all the Males that were left of the bloud Royall: as if Nature her ſelfe held it an unworthy Act, that man ſhould be deſpoyld of thoſe parts, that were given him for the preſervation of the whole kind.
               The ſame vertue is attributed alſo, by ſome other Naturaliſts, to that kind of Corall, which is for this reaſon called Charitoblepharon; and alſo to the Hearbe Catanance: and by Philoſtratus, to an Oyle that drops from certaine trees, growing on the banke of the river Hyphaſis in India; wherewith all the Indians are wont to annoynt themſelves on their Marriage day.
               
                  
But for mine owne part, I am more inclined to be of the Poet Menanders opinion, who thinkes that the ſtrongeſt tye, for the retaining of Man and Wife in Mutuall amity and concord is to have Children. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Becauſe that, Children, as the Philoſopher ſaith, are Commune Quid, a Benefit that both parties have equall ſhare in: and are therefore the fitteſt Mediators, and Vmpires betwixt Man and Wife. Now it is the property of a Mediator to reconcile, and reunite both parties: as Ariſtotle ſaith. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Now if you deſire to know what means are to be uſed for the cure of Impotency in Men, and Barrenneſſe in Women: I deſire you to have recourſe unto a treatiſe I have formerly written of the ſame ſubject.
               The Romane Ladies made great account of the hearbe Hippogloſſum, or Horſe-tongue, which they called Bonifacia, and attributed great vertue unto it for the reconcilement and reuniting of married perſons. Albertus Magnus, &amp; Lemnius attribute the like vertue to a certaine

ſtone, which, they ſay, is found in the belly of a Capon, that was not gelded untill he was foure years old: which ſtone, they ſay, is of an exceeding bright colour, and as tranſparant as Chriſtall, and about the bigneſſe of a Beane. Now he that means to prove the vertue of it, muſt take and wrap it up in a piece of skinne or bladder, and ſo weare it about him. Pliny affirmes that Eringo roots are of great force in this caſe. But I for my part am of the Poets opinion, who ſaies that
               
                  Malè quaeritur Herbis;
                  Moribus, &amp; Formâ conciliandus Amor.
               
               It is an idle and vaine thing, to goe about to procure Love by Hearbs, or Charmes, or the like fooliſh deviſes: for true Love is cauſed only by beauty, and the vertuous diſpoſitions of the Mind.
               Yet ſometimes I confeſſe, it is brought to paſſe by the uſe of Charmes &amp; Witchcraft, that Married perſons fall off from the Love they formerly bare to each other: and ſo by this meanes are forced to entertaine new deſires, and yeeld up

themſelves to embrace the Love of ſtrangers. Theſe Charmes are commonly called in Latine, Nodi, ſive Ligamina Amatoria: of which many of our Moderne Phyſitians have written, and particularly Arnaldus de Ʋilla Nova, in his Tract de Ligaturis Phyſicis. And it is the opinion alſo of many both Divines and Phyſitians that it is probable, that the Divell, who is the Author of all Miſchiefe, hath power to quench lawfull Loves, and to kindle new and unlawfull deſires in men: as firſt, by making the Husband Impotent towards his owne wife, by the application of ſome naturall things that may have that vertue; which he can at his pleaſure remove againe, when the ſame man comes to meddle with any other woman. Secondly, by raiſing diſſentions, and Iealouſies betwixt them. Thirdly by cauſing ſome loathſome diſeaſe or other, in either of the Parties: as it is reported of Medea, who by the power of her Charmes is ſaid to have made all the Lemnian women to have ſtinking breaths, in ſo much that their Husbands could not endure to come neare them. Fourthly, by troubling their

Imagination, and making either the Husband, or the wife ſeeme miſhapen and deformed to the others eye; and all other both Men and Women to appeare faire and beautifull. Or laſtly, by working ſome ſecret Antipathy betwixt them. For it is reported by Egnatius, that one 
                     Ʋalaſca, a Bohemian wench, by her charmes cauſed the Women of Bohemia to kill all the men in that place where ſhe was, all in one night. Or elſe the Divell may doe this, by working ſome ſtrange Alteration in the Temperature of the Genitall parts either of the Man, or of the Woman: for by this meanes ſome men have become Impotent, and unapt for Copulation: and on the contrary, ſome Women have been as ſalt as Bitches: as Saxo Grammaticus reports.
               But we muſt take heed that we doe not Ignorantly impute theſe effects to Magicke, Charmes, or Sorcery, when as indeed they are produced by Naturall cauſes: As did of old the Scythians, who, having made themſelves Impotent, by cutting the veines, Arteries, or Nerves that joyne cloſe to the Eares, notwithſtanding

thought that it was a puniſhment inflicted upon them, by the Goddeſſe 
                     Ʋenus Ʋrania, in revenge of the injury their Anceſtors had done unto her, in pulling downe and rifling a Temple that was dedicated to her Honour in Aſcalon, a famous Citty of Paleſtina.
               
               We muſt alſo be ſure that the Woman be not 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , wanting the naturall paſſage deſtin'd for the uſe of Copulation; as was Cornelia, the mother of the Gracchi: And in this caſe, the paſſage muſt be opend with an inſtrument, according to the directions of Albucaſis, Aetius, Ioan: Wierus, Pareus, &amp; other Authentique Authors: Which thing I my ſelfe alſo once cauſed to be done in the City of Caſtelnaudary to two young maides of the ſame place. Notwithſtanding this defect is incident both to Widowes, and to Married women alſo, if their Husbands chance to be a long time abſent from them: as Iean Liebault affirmes that himſelfe hath knowne it happen to two women that were neighbours of his. And I am much inclined to ſuſpect, that Namyſia, &amp; Phaethuſa, two

women whom Hippocrates reports to have been Metamorphoſed into Men, were only troubled with this diſeaſe: which is indeed more rarely, and ſeldomer ſeen in Women, then the other contrary diſeaſe to this is, which many times proves the Occaſion of quenching Loves deſires in Married perſons. But I ſhall not here ſet downe the manner of curing theſe two oppoſite diſeaſes: but ſhall rather referre you to Avicen, Aetius, Aegineta, and all moderne writers that have ſpoken any thing of Barrenneſſe, or of the Diſeaſes of Women.
               
                  Arnaldus de Ʋilla Nova, in his tract that he hath writren concerning the Remedies that muſt be uſed againſt the Divell, and his ſorceries, counſels us to cauſe the party affected to carry about him a quill of Quickſilver, or elſe a piece of Corall, the hearbe Motherwort, or Squills. Ioannes de Ʋigo adviſeth to beſprinkle the houſe of the party that is enchanted or bewitched, with the blood of a black dog. Some other will have him eate the fleſh of a Magpy, or Wood-pecker: or elſe to annoynt the body of the Inchanted perſon

with the gall of a Raven, tempered with the powder of Hartwort.
               But my opinion ſhall ever be, that Inchantments and Sorceries, are to be cured rather by Prayer and Faſting, and not by Phyſicall or Naturall remedies.
            
            
               CHAP. XXXV. Of Philters, and Poëticall Cures of Love.
               
               BEfore we deſcend to the cure of Love-Melancholy, it is neceſſary that we examine, whether, or no, this diſeaſe may be cauſed by Philters, and in like manner alſo cured by Poeticall remedies, or any other thing that is of a Nature contrary to theſe Philters. Thoſe that endeavour to maintaine the power of Philters, or Love potions, alleadge for themſelves, that if it be in the power of a Sorcerer or Magician to cauſe Hate; they may then as eaſily produce the contrary

Paſſion, which is, Love; and that, by the uſe of certaine Characters, Charmes, Poyſons, Meats, or Medicines, which may ſtirre up the Humours, heate the blood, or by ſome other meanes provoke them to Luſt. And this their Aſſertion they labour to prove out of that place of the Prophet Nahum, where there is a woe pronounced againſt the bloody City &amp;c. Becauſe of the multitude of the Whoredoms of the well favoured Harlot the Miſtreſſe of Witchcrafts, that ſelleth Nations through her Whoredoms, and Families through her witchcrafts. Where by Witchcrafts, they ſay, is meant Philters, which they uſed to make, by burning the ſtones of Olives: as may be collected out of the book of Baruch. And this is the reaſon, as they conceave, that Plato, in Convivio, ſaies, that Love is 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , a great Magitian and a Sorcerer.
               The Heathen of old time attributed ſo great power and vertue, to theſe Philters, and Love Potions; as that they beleeved it to be impoſſible, but that whoſoever dranke them, ſhould forthwith yeeld

themſelves up to the pleaſure of thoſe that gave it them.
               
                  Hic Theſſala vendit
                  Philtra, quibus valeant mentem vexare mariti,
                  Et ſoleâ pulſare nates, &amp;c.
               
               
                  Plutarch in his diſcourſe of Marriage ſeemes very confidently to beleeve, that there is ſuch a Vertue in Philters: but yet he abſolutely rejects them, &amp; holds them very dangerous to be uſed. And he proves it by the example of Poyſoned Baites, that men uſe ſometimes to fiſh withall. For as theſe poyſoned Baites doe indeed ſuddenly, and very certainly catch all thoſe Fiſhes, that doe but taſt of them: yet are the Fiſhes to taken the more dangerous and unfit to be eaten. In like manner fares it with thoſe women that uſe Love Potions, Charmes, and Sorceries, to inveagle thoſe they doat on: for, notwithſtanding that by this meanes they are indeed certaine to enjoy them, yet it is but in a kinde of Forced and Inraged manner, without any true cōtentment at all. Circe,
                  
ſaith he, was both of this Sexe, &amp; Nature yet receaved ſhe but ſmall content from thoſe that ſhe had by her Philters &amp; Magicall Spells transformed into Beaſts. On the other ſide, ſhe doated on Vliſſes, who knew well enough how to love with diſcretion, notwithſtanding all her powerfull Charmes.
               You ſhall meet with diverſe of theſe kindes of fooleries, in Tibullus, Propertius, Horace, Theocritus, and in 
                     Ʋirgil alſo; who hath this that followes.
               
                  Limus ut hic dureſcit; &amp; haec ut Ceraliqueſcit,
                  Vno &amp; eodem igne; ſic noſtro Daphnis Amore.
               
               
                  Apuleius in the third book of his Metamorphoſis, relates a pretty paſſage that befell his Hoſteſſe Pamphile: who ſending Fotis her Waiting-maid for ſome of the haire of a certaine young fellow, whom ſhe was deſperatly in love withall; intending to try an experiment of her skill in Sorcery upon him, to force him to her will: the Maid, as it ſeemes, miſſing of her

purpoſe, and not daring to returne home to her Miſtreſſe empty-handed, eſpies by chance where ſome were ſhaving the haire of certaine bladders that they had made of Goat-skinnes for to ſwimme withall. And ſo taking with her ſome of this Haire, ſhe returnes home, and concealing the truth of the buſineſſe, delivers it to her Miſtreſſe for the true Haire ſhe ſent her for. At length when Pamphile had finiſhed all her Magicall Ceremonies, and now began every minute to expect her Lovers approach: on a ſuddaine, cleane contrary to her expectation, there comes leaping into her Chamber thoſe Bladders of Goat-skinnes before mentioned, of whoſe haire Fotis had brought to her Miſtreſle, which came very readily to ſatisfy her deſires, in obedience to the power of her Spells.
               
                  Ioubertus, and Liebault report, that the women in many places, when they are newly delivered of a daughter, deſire the women that are preſent, to ſave the Navill ſtring of the Child: hoping by this meanes to gaine them ſtore of Suitors, when they are once ripe for Marriage. For

they very confidently beleeve, that if a li
                     •
                  
                  tle quantity of the Navill ſtring, being fir

                   to a young man in his drinke; hee cannot chooſe but inſtantly fall in love with the Wench that gives it. The ground of this cuſtome, or rather Popular Errour, you may read in the above-named Phyſitians.
               And the Sorcereſſe Medea thought that Venus made the ſame uſe of the Bird called by the Greekes 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , which, as Noel le Conte in his Mythologies, and Vigenerius upon Philoſtratus conceave, is the ſame that the Latines call Motacilla, in Engliſh a Wagtaile; which is accounted of great power to cauſe Love: and therefore Pindarus calls it, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , a Raging, or Mad Bird. But in my opinion, theſe Authors are very much deceaved in this: for the Bird 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   is deſcribed by Ariſtotle, to have two Clawes on each foot before, and as many behind; quite contrary to the nature of all other Birds whatſoever. This Bird is called by P. Bellonius, Turcot, or Tercot: and by the Latines, Torquilla, a Wryneck, or Hickway: Gaza, and Pacius tranſlate it, Turbo. But the

Wagtaile is called in Greeke, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , i. e. Culicilega avis.
               
               Theſe Philters, for the moſt part, were mixt with ſome poyſonous Ingredients; which many times cauſed the death of the party that took them. Such were thoſe that were given to Lucullus, and to Leander, ſonne in law to Aretaphile; of whom Plutarch makes mention: and to Lucretius, as Euſebius reports: to Fridericus, Duke of Bavaria, and King of the Romans; as it is related by Cuspinian. To which we may adde that, for which Temnia, an Athenian Matrone, was juſtly condemned to death by the Athenians, who notwithſtanding had a litle before (as Ariſtotle relates it) pardoned another woman, who was convicted of the ſame crime; the Areopagites thinking the greife, that ſhe muſt needs conceave, for having been the murthereſſe of her own deare Husband, to be a puniſhment more cruell then Death it ſelfe: which is the puniſhment aſſigned for this fact by the Civill Law, l. etiam. ff. ad l. Corn. de ſic. &amp; Ʋenef.
               
               I might here adde that which was given

to Lancelot, King of Naples, by one of his owne Phyſitians, that owed him a ſpite, for having baſely forced his daughter: of which, both the King, and the Innocent Damſell alſo died, in a moſt cruell &amp; miſerable manner: as you may read the ſtory at large in Nauclerus, M. Montaigne, &amp; G. Dupreau, in the yeare 1440.
               Thoſe Philters which did not kill thoſe that tooke them; did notwithſtanding utterly deſtroy their Iudgement. And of this laſt kinde was that which Ciree gave to Vliſſes Souldiers: and that which Coeſonia gave to the Emperour Caligula her Husband: according to the Satyriſt.
               
                  Tamen hoc tolerabile: ſi non
                  Et furere incipias; ut avunculus ille Neronis,
                  Cui totam tremuli frontem Coeſonia pulli Infudit.
               
               This Philter, here ſpoken of by Iuvenai, was a certaine piece of fleſh that is found growing on the forehead of a Colt newly foaled, and is about the bigneſſe of a Fig, being of a black colour, and almoſt round:

as both Pliny and Ariſtotle affirme. Notwithſtanding Ariſtotle in another place gives the ſame name to a certaine liquor, that drops from a Mare when ſhee takes Horſe, being ſomewhat like unto the Seed of the Mare, but more liquid and thin. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : And ſome, ſaith he, call this liquor, Hippomanes: but ſome others will have that to be the true Hippomanes, which growes on the Colts forehead. Tibullus the Poet ſeemes to bee of the other opinion, where he ſaies:
               
                  Vbi indomitis gregibus Venus afflat amores:
                  Hippomanes rabidae ſtillat ab inguine Equae.
               
               Notwithſtanding Aloyſius Anguillara, Cratenas, Dodoneus, and Veckerus, are of opinion, that Theocritus, by Hippomanes, meanes the Hearbe Stramonia, called by the Arabians, Nux Methel: and by the French, Pomme de Peru: in Engliſh, the Thorne-apple. And Rodericus à Castro will have it to be a certaine litle plant growing in Arcadie, called in French, Faug ere.
               
               
                  
                  Porphyrius in his booke de Sacrificiis, notwithſtanding that he was himſelfe a Notorious Magician, as S. Auguſtine witneſſeth of him, lib. 10. de Civit. Dei, cap. 9. confeſſes the Divell to be the Author, as of theſe Philters, ſo of all other deceits, couſenage, and lies. And therefore I dare not aſſent unto Ioſephus, and ſome others after him, who are bold to affirme, that Moſes, when hee had brought the children of Iſrael out of the Land of Egypt, &amp; the peoples deſires were ſtill toward the place from whence they came, compoſed by his great learning and Art, certaine Rings, that had the power to cauſe forgetfulneſſe of Love, in the parties that wore them.
               However, we deny not but that there may be Medicines, Meats, and Poyſons, of a power provoking to Luſt: of which kinde you ſhall meet with diverſe Catalogues in Avicen, Aëtius, Aegineta, Oribaſius, and all our Moderne Phyſitians, that have treated of Sterility, and Impotency, both in Women and Men. But wee abſolutely deny that there is any ſuch power in any of them, as to make Iohn love Jone,
                  
rather then Iulian: much leſſe to make any one beſotted with Love.

               Of this opinion alſo was Olympia, wife to King Philip of Macedon, and mother to Alexander the Great: of whom it is ſtoried, that when one told her that a certain Damſell about the Court, had by the force of ſome Charmes or Enchantments that ſhe had uſed, cauſed her husband the King to fall in love with her: ſhe no ſooner ſaw the beauty of the Damſell, but that preſently ſhe cries out; 
                     Ʋaleant Calumniae: tu in te Philtta habes. Away with theſe falſe and ſlanderous accuſations; I muſt acquit thee of them; Thy Beauty is all the Philters thou uſeſt.

                     If Love by enchantments could commanded be,
                     Each old Witch then would pleaſe her Lovers eye.

               The Pagans were wont to preſerve themſelves againſt the power of theſe Philters, by certaine remedies of the ſame ſtampe, which they call Homericall. Not, becauſe this Poet was the firſt Founder and Inventor of them, as ſome have thought: But they were rather called by this name, becauſe that, as they conceived, they deſerved all Admiration and praiſe, as did all the Actions and workes of this Divine Poet: who, as it is reported of him, by repeating certaine words over ſicke perſons, cured diverſe diſeaſes: and in like manner by ſaying certaine verſes over one

that was troubled with an iſſue of blood, inſtantly ſtopt it: as it is alſo reported of the ſonnes of Autolycus, who ſtopped 
                     Ʋ
                     liſſes blood, when he had received a great wound in his thigh on the Mountaint Parnaſſus, only by ſome Charme or ſpell they uſed.

               Theſe Poeticall, or Homericall Remedies, conſiſted in certaine Charmes, Characters, Amulets, or ſuch like Periapſes, which no Chriſtian Phyſitian ought to uſe: notwithſtanding that the common people doe to this day too ſuperſtitiouſly believe, and put in practiſe many of theſe Paganiſh deviſes.
               In concluſion then we affirme, that the moſt powerfull and ſoveraigne remedy againſt Philters, are Prayers, reading of good bookes, and other ſerious exerciſes.

               CAP. XXXVI. Empericall Remedies for the Cure of Love, and Erotique Melancholy.
               
               THe Ancient Greeks in this caſe, had in great account the Copaean Lake, wherein Agamemnon is reported by Plutarch to have bathed himſelfe, when hee deſired to quit the Love of the faire Chryſeis. Dexicreon is ſaid to have cured the Samian women of this diſeaſe, by ſome certaine Ceremonies, and Expiatory Sacrifices that he uſed. Others were wont to repaire to the Sepulchers of Rhadina, Leontina, or Jole, and there offer up their devotions. But the moſt famous, and certaine Remedy of all, was the Leucadian Rocke, from the top whereof diſtracted Lovers would throw themſelves downe headlong into the ſea. The firſt that ever adventured

to make experiment of it, is ſaid to be Sapho.
               
               
                  Saltuſ
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      ingreſſa viriles,
                  Non formidatâ temeraria Chalcide Sapho.
               
               And this ſhe did, becauſe ſhe could not obtaine the Love of hard-hearted Phao, as ſhe complaines her ſelfe: and this provoked her to this deſperate Attempt.
               But thoſe Antiquaries, that have enquired more diligently into the truth hereof, affirme, that the firſt that ever took this Leape, was one Phocas; or, as ſome rather thinke, one Cephalus, who was enamoured of Pterela. Sapho, in Ovid, attributes the glory of this diſcovery to Deucalion, who was extreamely tranſported with the Love of Pyrrha, whom afterwards he married.
               
                  
                     Hinc ſe Deucalion, Pyrrhae ſuccenſus amore,
                  
                  
                     Miſit; &amp; illaeſo corpore preſſit aquas.
                  
                  
                     Nec non verſus Amor fugit lentiſſima Merſi
                  
                  
                     Pectora: Deucalion ig ne levatus erat.
                  
               
               
                  
The faire Calyce alſo, ſo highly commended by the Poet Steſichorus for her beauty, was ſo miſerably enamoured of Evanthlus, that ſeeing her ſelfe refuſed by him, ſhe adventured to runne that deſperate courſe that Sapho had done before her.
               But the harſhneſſe and unpleaſantneſſe of this Remedy, gave occaſion to ſome others to ſubſtitute inſtead thereof Cupids fountaine in Cyzicus, the vertue whereof, as Mutianus reports, was ſuch, as that it would utterly extinguiſh and allay the heats of doating Lovers. Of the like vertue alſo was the river Selemnus, ſpoken of by Pauſanias; who notwithſtanding ſeems to give litle or no credit at all unto it. For if this were ſo, ſaith he, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : the water of this river would be far more pretious then gold. Notwithſtanding for my owne part, I find no ſuch great Abſurdity, or Improbability in the ſtory of this River. For it is moſt certaine, that a Bath of cold water is a very ſoveraigne Remedy for the cure of the Vterine Fury, which is a Species of Love-Melancholy; and alſo of

the Dropſy: eſpecially if the water be any whit Minerall, as it is probable the waters of thoſe fountaines were. And this ſeems alſo to be very much confirmed by Mercurialis, who aſſures us that he hath cured diverſe women of this diſeaſe of Love, meerely by making them drinke a good quantity of cold water, and bathing them in the like.
               The Doricke Muſicke is alſo reported to have been of ſo great force in appeaſing and compoſing the perturbations of the Mind, as Galen ſaith, as that Agamemnon, the Generall of the Grecian forces in the Expedition againſt Troy, left no other Guardian of his Wives Chaſtity in his abſence, ſave only a Muſitian, that was excellently well skilled in the Doricke Tone; who by the power of his Harmony reſtrained Clytemneſtra from all unchaſt and Illicite Loves, ſo long as he lived. But the Adulterous Aegiſtus, perceiving that ſo long as the Muſitian lived, it was impoſſible for him to compaſſe his deſignes; he cauſed him to be murdered, and by this meanes at length obtained the love of the faire Clytemneſtra, Boëthius tels a ſtory of

                  Pythagoras, how that meeting a company of mad Youngſters, who being well heated with wine, were going about to offer violence to ſome that detained a ſweetheart of theirs from them, threatning to ſet the houſe afire about their eares: Pythagoras preſently cauſed the Muſitian that played to them to change the Tone: and ſo by a heavy, grave, Spondaicall Muſicke, hee preſently appeaſed their fury, and made them give over their violence and inſolent attempt.
               
                  Ovid makes mention of a certaine Oblivious, or Lethaean Love, to whom the ancient Romans dedicated a Temple, and built it on the the top of the Mountaine Eryx, neare unto which ſtood the Temple of Venus. And to this forgetfull God would all thoſe, that deſired to deliver themſelves from their Amorous follies, tender their devotions.
               
                  
                     Est illic Lethaeus Amor, qui pectora ſanat,
                  
                  
                     In
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         ſuas gelidam lampadas addit aquam.
                  
                  
                     Illic &amp; Iuvenes Votis oblivia poſcunt:
                  
                  
                     Et 
                           •
                        i qua eſt duro capta marita viro.
                  
               
               
                  
Inſtead of this Deity, the Greekes acknowledged and offered ſacrifice to 
                     Ʋenus, ſurnamed Apoſtraphia: which I conceive to bee the ſame with the Celeſtiall Venus, or 
                     Ʋrania: whom the Scythians alſo anciently worſhipped at Aſcalon, after that by cutting the veines or Arteries behind their Eares they had made themſelves weake and Impotent, as is before delivered.
               
                  Terpſicles, as Athenaeus reports him, preſcribes for the cure of Love, a Mullet, that hath been ſuffocated in a veſſell of wine: And Pliny for the ſame purpoſe commends Chryſocolla, which the Arabians call Baurach: or elſe the drinking of wine that a Lizard hath been choaked in. The Ancients made great account alſo of the waxe of a mans left eare; and of Pigeons dung, ſteeped in oyle: as alſo of the Vrine of a Hee-goat, mixed with a quantity of Indian Spikenard. Iohannes de Vigo, who was Surgeon to Pope Iulius the Second, counſells the party affected to take the Excrement of the perſon he is in love with, and burne it: affirming very confidently, that this is a moſt ſingular and

certaine remedy; if the Patient doe but ſmell it. But ſuch Receits as theſe, come out of the ſhops of ſuch kind of Phyſitians, as Ariſtophanes calls 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Some other there are, that in this caſe will have a wenches haire cut of; juſt as Farriers uſe to doe with Mares, who cut of their Manes, when they deſire to take horſe.
               In a word, there is not a Naturaliſt, that hath not invented ſome ſtrange Medicine or other, for the cure of this diſeaſe. Albertus Magnus, and Cardan, commend the Emerauld, Ruby, and Saphire in this caſe: ſome others as highly extoll the vertue of the Diamond: and a third ſort preferre the Topaz, and the Amethiſt. Picatrice commends the juyce of the Myrtle tree, the braine of Swallowes; and alſo the blood of the party beloved. Which experiment we find in ſtory that Marcus Aurelius the Emperour proved upon his wife Faustina, who doated extreamely on a certaine Gladiator in Rome. To quench which unchaſt deſires of her, the Emperour was adviſed by the Chaldaeans, to cauſe the ſaid Gladiator to bee murdered ſecretly, that his wife might not know it,

and that ſome of his blood ſhould bee given her to drink, the next night that himſelfe intended to lye with her: which was performed accordingly, but with this bad ſucceſſe. For that night was begotten Antonius Commodus, one of the moſt bloody and cruell Tyrants, that ever Rome brought forth: and ſuch a one he was beſides, as ſpent his time wholly among Fencers, and ſuch like companions, and was farre more like the Sword-player that was kill'd, then his owne father, the good Emperour Marcus Aurelius, who, as Auſonius ſaies of him,
               Hoc ſolum Patriae, quòd genuit, nocuit.
               Was never injurious to his Countrey in any thing, but only that he begot this Sonne.
               
                  Deianira, being Iealous that Hercules made too much of Iole, was perſwaded by the deceitfull Centaure. Neſſus, that ſhe might utterly extinguiſh all his unlawfull deſires towards her, or any other, if ſhe would but follow his adviſe; which was, to ſend him a ſhirt, that had been dipped

inoyle, and the blood of the Centaure. But the Event miſerably deceived her expectation: for inſtead of curing him of his Love-follies, it made him dye a moſt cruell death, and full of rage and Torment.

                  MArſilius Ficinus upon Plato's Convivium, and Franciſcus Ʋalleriola, affirme, that ſeeing that all diſeaſes are cured by their Contraries; according to that true and common Axiom, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Jllaqueationis autem contrarium eſt ſolutio; Looſing, is the Contrary to Enſnaring, or Binding: it hence neceſſarily followes, that Love muſt be cured by Solution, or Looſeing. And of this Solution they make two kinds; the one

Naturall, and the other Artificiall: the latter of theſe depending chiefly on Evacuation, as we ſhall ſhew in the Chapters enſueing: the other on the admonitions of pious, vertuous, and learned men; as alſo the change of Ayre, Abſtinence, Labour, Cares, Feares, and Sadneſſe. Which Remedies notwithſtanding I account more fit and proper for the Prevention of this diſeaſe, then for the Cure of it: conſidering that it is farre eaſier to deſtroy Love, when as it is yet but in the Bud, then after it is ripened into a diſeaſe. According to the adviſe of the Poet.
               
                  
                     Dum novus eſt, caepto potius medeamur Amori.
                     Flamma recens sparſà parva reſedit aquâ.
                     Opprime, dum nova ſunt, ſubiti mala ſemina morbi.
                     Nam mora dat vires: &amp;c.
                  
                  
                     Stop Loves beginnings, that it grow no higher.
                     A litle water drownes new kindled fire.

Of time, and riper growth improves their ſtrength.
                  
               
               The Regiment then, or Order of Diet in the cure of Love-Melancholy, differs not at all from that, that is to be obſerved in the Prevention of it: ſave only that it ought to be ſomewhat more Humectative, and leſſe Refrigerative: Not forgetting in the meane time thoſe meats that by ſome certaine Occult Properties they have in them, are found to be very good for thoſe that are ſick of this diſeaſe: as, the Turtle-dove, the heart of a Wolfe, young Owles taken and boyled in the juyce of Marioram; the fleſh of Rats, and the like. And if the party be fallen away in his body, and is now growne very thin, and dry: you muſt then preſcribe him the ſame order of Diet, according to Avicen, as you doe to thoſe that are Hecticall.
               Beſides this, it is agreed upon by all, both Divines, Philoſophers, Phyſitians, Oratours, and Poets, that it is very good in this caſe that the party change the Ayre and place of his Abode: and that, not ſo much becauſe it is a very wholeſome

courſe ſo to doe, in all Chronicall, and long continued diſeaſes, as Hippocrates in Epidem: affirmes;

                  : but rather, becauſe that this change and variety of Place doth awaken the ſpirits of the Melancholy Lover, diverting alſo his thoughts, and depriving him of the ſight, and ordinary converſation that he formerly had with the Object of his Love, and cauſe of his diſeaſe. Adducendus, ſaith Tully in his 4. Tuſcul. ad alia ſtudia, curas, ſollicitudines, negotia: Loci deni

               Nothwithſtanding, as this Change of Ayre, and Place, hath no power of it ſelfe to cure Folly; or to make him wiſe, that deſires not to be ſo: (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   ſaid one of the ſeaven Graecian Sages: Change of Place neither takes away Folly, nor teaches a man wiſdome.) So neither doth it profit a Paſſionate Lover any more, as Plato ſaies, then the ſhifting of his Bed doth a man that lies ſicke of a Feaver. And the reaſon is, becauſe that the Lover is alwaies longing for the preſence

of his Miſtreſſe, and contemplating on her vertues, and Perfection, which ſeeme, by this her abſence, to be the more encreaſed. For, as the Poet ſaith,
               
                  Animus, quod perdidit, optat:
                  At
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      in praeteritâ ſe totus Imagine verſat.
               
               It is naturall to the minds of men, ſtill the more eagerly to purſue thoſe things that are denyed them, and to deſire the more earneſtly that which they cannot compaſſe. To what purpoſe ſhould a Lover runne away, ſaies an old Poet, ſeeing that Cupid has winges, and can quickly overtake a Runnagate, though he make never ſo great haſt to avoyd him.
               
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     .
               
               Theſe two wings, ſaith P. Haedus in Anther. ſignify the double Hope that a Lover hath, of being loved, and of being able to compaſſe the enjoyment of that he loves: which is indeed the Principall Obſtacle that hinders the cure of this Malady.
               
                  
But this change of place is a very ſure remedy for the prevention of this diſeaſe; and alſo not altogether Vnprofitable, for one that is actually in Love, if ſo be that he hath fully reſolved to endeavour to quit his deſires. And this we may ſee confirmed by the example of 
                     Ʋliſſes: and alſo of Aeneas, whom the Queen of Carthage loved, and made ſo much of. Otherwiſe this courſe proves very dangerous, and hurtfull for Melancholy Lovers.
               
                  Nam ſi ab eſt quod amas, praestò ſimulachra tamen ſunt
                  Jllius, &amp; nomen dulce obverſatur ad aureis.
               
               That this remedy therefore may prove the more effectuall, it behoves the party affected, that firſt he diſcharge himſelfe of all his deſires, before he quit his countrey; as Diogenes once anſwered a Love-ſicke Gallant: That ſo at his returne he may make his Miſtreſſe the ſame anſweare, that the young man did, of whom S. Auguſtine ſpeakes: who returning home after a long pilgrimage, and meeting with an old ſweet heart of his, who wondred very

much at his ſtrangeneſſe, and that he tooke no more notice of her: which made her ſuſpect that happily he might, by reaſon of his long abſence, forget her: ſhe therefore to prove the truth of it, told him who ſhe was, in theſe words; Ego ſum ego: I am the ſame you left me. But he returned her this peremptory reply; At ego non ſum ego: Though you are the ſame ſtill, I am not.

               As this Change of the Aire, and Place, is no very powerfull Remedy againſt this diſeaſe: ſo neither is Solitarineſſe; as we may perceave by the examples of Phillis, Eccho, Pan, and many others, ſpoken of by the Poets. And I confeſſe my ſelfe to be of Aegineta's opinion, who very confidently affirmes, that many ignorant Phyſitians have undone their Love-ſick Patients, by enjoyning them Abſtinence and Solitarineſſe: (Hos igitur maeſtos, &amp; pervigiles, cùm quidam dispoſitionem non ſatis

                      animum abducunt:) where as, ſaith he, a wiſe and underſtanding Phyſitian would rather cauſe them to cheere up themſelves, and ſeeke to divert their thoughts from Love, by carrying them to Muſicke, Plaies, Sights, Feaſts, and the like. And the reaſon is, becauſe that theſe kind of people, in their Lonelineſſe thinke of nothing elſe but their Loves, having their hearts filled with longing deſires, their mouths breathing forth nought but ſighes and complaints, and their eyes, for the moſt part, ore-flowing with Teares: all which increaſe their flames the more: as the Poet ſaies.

                  Lot, we know, was tranſported with unchaſt and Inceſtuous deſires, ſo ſoone as ever he had retired into a ſolitary place with his daughters: who notwithſtanding before had alwaies lived chaſt, in the midſt of the Infamous and wicked Sodomites. Our Poets alſo have filled their writings with the ſtories of the Loves of Faunes, Satyrs, Cyclopes, Nymphes, and Hamadryades. But on the contrary ſide, Company, and Frequency of converſation, and commerce with people, diverts the mind of a doating Lover, and cheares him up, and makes him ſee his Error.
               
                  Franciſcus Ʋalleriola, in his Obſervations, ſaies, that he found by experience, in the cure of that rich Merchant of Arles, that Solitarineſſe doth very litle good in this caſe, but is rather very Hurtfull and dangerous. And therefore he took all the care he could, that he ſhould be continually viſited by his kinsfolke and acquaintance. And I am of opinion, that the danger is ſo much the greater, if the diſeaſe proceed from black Choler, or Melancholy:

for then it is to be feared, that if he be left alone, he will either make away with himſelfe, as diverſe in this caſe have done; or elſe he will runne mad: as Avicen advertiſeth, about the end of his Chapter de Amant. Notwithſtanding I doe greatly approve of Solitarineſſe, for the Prevention of this diſeaſe: provided alwaies, that we joyne with it Faſting, Watching and Prayer: as many Religious and holy men have done, who have retired into Caves and Deſerts, for this very purpoſe.
               To Solitarineſſe many have joyned Hunting: for by this meanes Diana was able to repell all Cupids darts; and Hippolytus neglected the unchaſt embraces of his ſhameleſſe ſtep-mother. For Hunting ſeems to be very uſefull in this caſe, not only becauſe it diverts the Louers mind from entertaining its owne unbridled Paſſions: But alſo becauſe that it excites and quickens the Appetite of the poore decaied Melancholico; and by wearineſſe, provokes in him a kind of pleaſant Refreſhing Drowſineſſe, and diſpoſition to ſleepe, which gives him not leaſure to

dreame of his owne fond deſires. And yet Hunting did the more enflame the Love of Queen Dido, as it hath alſo done in many other of the Nymphs.
               Thoſe that delight not in hunting, may uſe in ſtead thereof diverſe other exerciſes either of the Body, or of the Mind, (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  :) which are indeed the ſureſt and moſt wholſome remedies for this diſeaſe, by the common accord of all our Doctors: for as much as theſe divert all Amorous thoughts, blot out all remembrance of paſt pleaſures, conſume the ſuperfluous blood, and refreſh the ſpirits of the ſick party, reſtoring him to his former ſtate of body, if his diſeaſe have any whit impaired it.
               The exerciſes I would eſpecially commend, ſhould be Walking, diſcourſing, honeſt paſtimes, Banqueting, Muſicke, and ſuch exerciſes of Recreation: from which I would baniſh all young Men, if ſo be the party thus affected be a Maid, or Widow: and ſo on the contrary, if it be a Man, you muſt by no means admit the company of Women: (although I confeſſe, Valleriola
                  
is of the contrary opinion.)
               And yet Avicen affirmes, that it is often ſeen, that theſe Remedies prove very hurtfull to many. And therefore the Clinicall Phyſitian muſt be ſure to deale very warily, and diſcreetly in this caſe.
               The Poet Menander addes to theſe, Hunger, and Poverty: aſſuring us, that Love never ſeizes on Poore Men, nor Beggers.

               And the Poet Ovid gives us the reaſon of it alſo, in thoſe verſes of his.
               
                  Cur nemo eſt Hecalen, nulla est quae ceperit Irum?
                  Nempe quod alter Egens, altera pauper erat.
                  Non habet unde ſuum Paupert as paſcat Amorem.
               
               Poverty hath not wherewithall to maintaine Loves flames.
               
                  Rondeletius, in Method. Mercatus, and many other of our Moderne Phyſitians,

preſcribe Faſting, and Abſtinence to Melancholy Lovers: as likewiſe doe alſo all Gynaecian writers, to Women that are troubled with the Vterine Fury, which diſeaſe we have already proved to be a species of Love-Melancholy. But herein they all contradict the opinion of P. Aegineta, and Oribaſius, who reprehend thoſe Phyſitians, that preſcribe Abſtinence in theſe Caſes. The words of theſe Authors I ſhall here repreſent unto you, as I finde them tranſlated out of the Originall into Latine. Eos, qui ex Amore curis affecti, vigiliiſ
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      torti eſſent, cùm nonnulli id minùs intelligerent, balnei, cibi
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      abſtinentiâ, &amp; tenui victu conſumpſerunt. In quibus, cùm nos Amorem in cauſâ eſſe deprehenderemus; eorum animos, ab Amore, ad Balnea, ad Compotationes, ad geſtationes, ad Iudos, &amp; ad fabulas adduximus. And indeed Phaedra, who was in love with Hippolytus, found little help in Hunger; as ſhe her ſelfe confeſſeth in Euripides. And although the Proverbe ſay, that Sine Cerere, &amp; Libero, friget Venus: yet doe our Poets aſſure us, that Neptune himſelfe, together with all the whole Rabble of

Gods, and Goddeſſes of the Sea, Rivers, and Fountaines, have been often wounded with Cupids darts: Neither could our own forefathers eſcape his fury, even in thoſe times when they fed on nothing but Cheſtnuts and Acornes.
               Glans aluit Veteres; &amp; paſſim ſemper Amarunt.
               To reconcile therefore theſe different opinions, we ſay, that if the Love-ſicke perſon be so farre gone with Melancholy, as that he is now become leane, dry, and his body very much impayred; Faſting and Abſtinence is then very dangerous for him: And we muſt give him good meats, and ſuch as may moyſten and ſtrengthen his body againe. But if he be yet in good plight, and hath his fleſh about him, and is full of blood: Abſtinence in this caſe muſt needs be very good, ad Seminis, utpote cauſae primariae Amoris, conſumptionem: that ſo the ſuperfluity of ſeed, which is indeed the Primary Cauſe of this diſeaſe, may be conſumed. So that hence we may conclude, that this Remedy is more proper

and neceſſary for the Prevention, then for the Cure of Love-Melancholy.
               
                  Galen in his lib. 4. de Plaecit. Hip. &amp; Plat. acknowledging Time to be a ſoveraigne Remedy of all our Paſſions, preſcribes it for the Cure of Love-Melancholy alſo: which workes its effects chiefly, by employing the Imagination, with various occurrents and diverſities of Actions, and ſo at length diſmiſſeth, and rooteth out this firſt fooliſh impreſſion of Love, how deepe ſo ever it were. And Clemens Alexandrinus alſo, alleadging Crates Thebanus for his Author, ſaies, that it is the laſt remedy of Love, except Death. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . This Author, ſaith he, (ſpeaking of Crates Thebanus) ſaid well in another place, that the beſt remedy for to extinguiſh the violent flames of Luſt, is Hunger: or if this faile, we muſt then ſee what Time may bring to paſſe: but if neither of theſe ſucceed, the laſt refuge muſt be a Halter. For ſo will I have that paſſage in Clemens to be read and interpreted: ſeeing

that this clauſe, (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  .) which is omitted in Clemens Alexandrinus, is found not withſtanding both in Diogenes Lacrtius, in his life, and alſo in the Anthology. The verſes are theſe.

               Which the learned Alciat hath thus tranſlated into Latine:

               Many in this caſe uſe to whip and cudgell them; thinking by torturing the fleſh and externall parts, to extinguiſh their inward flames. And of this opinion is Gordonius, who would have them whipped ad putorem uſ

her expectation, had ſhe but lived: and not without ſome reaſon. For it is very certaine, that by cudgelling and beating the Back and Loynes, the blood is heated, and Flatuoſities ſtirred up; which filling the Fiſtular Nerve, may erect it, &amp; cauſe that diſeaſe which Phyſitians call Priapiſmus. And indeed the wench that was in Love with Cornelius Gallus, the more cruelly ſhee was beaten by her Father for it, the more eager and violent was her Love: as the Poet himſelfe confeſſeth.

                     Her tender limmes, doe but encreaſe her flames.

This Remedy then, in my opinion, ſhould rather be Prophylacticall, for Prevention of the diſeaſe, then Therapeuticall, for the Cure of it, when it is now ſetled.
               And now ſeeing that neither any of theſe Remedies here mentioned, nor thoſeother, reckoned up in the 21. Chapter of this booke, are found ſufficient for the cure of this diſeaſe of Love Melancholy; we ſhall now in the laſt place have recourſe to Chirurgicall, and Pharmacouticall Remedies.

               IF the Patient be in good plight of body, fat and corpulent, the firſt thing wee doe, we muſt let him bleed, in the Hepatica in the right arme, ſuch a proportionable quantity of blood, as ſhal be thought convenient both for his diſeaſe, complexion;

and ſtrength of body; as wee have already ſhewed in the Chapter of Prevention of Love-Melancholy, Becauſe that, as the Schoole of Salernes hath it,
               
                  Exhilarat triſtes; iratos placat; Amantes,
                  Ne ſint Amentes, Phlebotomia facit.
               
               
                  Phlebotomy makes thoſe that are ſad, Merry: appeaſeth thoſe that are Angry: and keepes Lovers from running Mad.
               But if the diſeaſe bee growne to that ripeneſſe, as that the party affected hath his Iudgement and Fancy perverted, I would then adviſe to open the Median, or Common veine, (which Rhaſis, &amp; Almanſor call, 
                     Ʋena Matrix, ſeu Cardiaca; as Valleriola alſo counſelleth: alwaies obſerving this rule, that if the blood runne black, groſſe, and very thick, we may then take away a good quantity of it: but if it be of a good colour, thin, and cleare; wee muſt then preſently ſtop the Veine; according to the preſcriptions of Galen, Avicen, and their Sectaries.
               After this generall Evacuation of blood hath been performed, for the correcting

of the Intemperature of the Liver, &amp; the ſpending of ſome part of the Melancholy blood: I come next of all to the opening of the Saphena, or Ankle Veine, eſpecially in Women, who in this diſeaſe are commonly troubled alſo with the Suffocation of the Matrix, or the Vterine Fury: becauſe that by this meanes there will bee the greater and more eaſy Revulſion of the Humours. For it is Hippocrates his adviſe,

                  ) &amp; Correſpondence with the Veines of the Hamme, or Ankle, then they have with thoſe of the Arme.
               Some Phyſitians will have ſome blood to be taken from the Veines in the Forehead, either with an Inſtrument, or elſe with Horſeleeches. But I ſhould rather preferre the opening of the Salvatella in the left Arme: which I have found by experience to have beene very good for the Cure of any diſeaſe, proceeding from Melancholy.
               Or elſe I would provoke the Fluxe of

the Haemorrhoids, as being a very ſure remedy, and very neceſſary alſo in the cure of all Hypochondriacall Melancholy: becauſe that by this Fluxe, the Spleen, and Meſentery diſcharge themſelves of all groſſe, and earthy Humours, that cauſe obſtructions in thoſe parts. And this courſe is commended unto us both by Hippocrates in his Aphoriſmes, and Epidemicks, &amp; alſo by Galen, in his Tract de Mania, and in his Comment upon the 25. Aphoriſme of Hippocrates, lib. 4. the words whereof are theſe: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . The opening of the Haemorrhoids is the ſureſt remedy both for the Cure, and the Prevention of any Melancholy diſeaſe.
               The Varices have almoſt the ſame vertue, that the Haemoroids have, if they chance to happen in this diſeaſe of Love-Melancholy; by reaſon that the Melancholy Flatuoſities are conveighed away from the Privy parts, where they would otherwiſe provoke a deſire to Venery; and are derived to the Veines in the Thighs, and other Varicall Veines: according to the

opinion both of Ariſtotle, and all our Moderne Phyſitians.
               But I muſt needs confeſſe, for my own part, that I have found the 
                     Ʋarices to bee of very litle, or no force at all in this caſe. And therefore I ſhould rather ſubſtitute inſtead thereof, as Arnaldus alſo adviſeth, Couping-glaſſes, applyed on the Legs, or Thighs, with ſufficient ſcarification: or elſe apply to the ſame parts, one, or two Potentiall Cauteries. But if the Clitoris, by reaſon of its length, be the cauſe of this Furious Deſire, as it very often happens ſo to be, it muſt then be taken ſhorter, according to the manner preſcribed by Moſchio, and Albucaſis: unto whom I muſt referre you, becauſe I deſire to avoid Tediouſneſſe.
               And in caſe theſe Remedies availe not, and the diſeaſe ſtill growes ſtronger, in ſo much that it may be feared, that without ſome ſpeedy redreſſe, the Patient will grow Wolfe-mad: you muſt then open the Arme Veines, and let them bleed, till the party is ready to fall downe for faintneſſe, and loſſe of blood: and you muſt alſo apply an Actuall Cautery, if the party can

endure it: otherwiſe you muſt be content with a Potentiall Cautery applyed to the Forehead; as both Aegineta, Oribafius, Avicen, and other Authors of good note informe us, in their ſeverall Tracts de Lycanthropia, Lycaone, Lycano, Alchatrab, and Alcutubut, into which diſeaſe this of Love-Melancholy doth many times degenerate: as Avicen affirmes, in his Chapter de Iliſco, ſive de Amore.
               
            
            
               CHAP. XXXIX. Pharmaceuticall Remedies for the cure of Love, or Erotique Melancholy.
               
               AS the Scurfe &amp; Itch cannot well be cured, unleſſe the Blood be firſt purified, and the ſalt, Nitrous Humours, which are immixed with the maſſe of the blood, be purged by convenient Medicines, orderly adminiſtred; and not raſhly and inconſiderately, but gently, and, as wee are

wont to ſay, per Epicraſin, purging out the bad Humours by degrees, and ſupplying good Humours inſtead of them: (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : ſaith Hippocrates. All ſuddaine and violent Evacuation, Repletion, Heating, or Cooling of the Body, or any the like violent Motion in the body whatſoever, is very dangerous. For Nature abhorres whatſoever is too much; but is pleaſed with a Mediocrity in all things. (Which Aphoriſme, although it ſeeme to be pronounced of all diſeaſes in generall; yet is it proved more particularly to be true, in the Scab, and Itch, which alwaies are obſerved to grow worſe, by the raſh and unadviſed application of Oyntments and Purges.) So likewiſe muſt wee take the ſame courſe and order of proceeding in the cure of Love-Melancholy, or Erotique Madneſſe; which diſeaſe requires a great deale of time for the curing of it, as well for thoſe reaſons before alleaged in the 21. Chapter, as alſo, becauſe that the Humour Peccant is the

more head-ſtrong and Intractable, by reaſon of its extreame Drineſſe: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : that which is Dry, is very hard to bee removed or wrought upon.
               And that this diſeaſe is not ſuddenly cured, but requires ſome good ſpace of time for the effecting of it, Hippocrates alſo aſſures us, in his booke de Natura Hominis. 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . For Melancholy, ſaith hee, being the moſt Viſcous and clammie Humour that is in the body, is therefore the hardeſt to be purged forth, &amp; requireth the lōgeſt time to be removed. Which ſeems alſo to be confirmed by the cure that Valleriola wrought upon the Merchant of Arles, which he could not perfect, under the ſpace of ſix, or ſeven Moneths.
               But for our more orderly and Methodicall proceeding in the cure of this diſeaſe, we will divide it into two Principall parts; namely the Humectation, or moyſtning of the Body, or of the Peccant Humour: and the Evacuation, and purging of the ſame: according as we are inſtructed

by Avicen alſo in this caſe. Canon curationis Melancholiae eſt, ut pervenias ad ultimum in Humectatione: &amp; cum hoc, non ſis diminutus in Evacuatione Cholerae Nigrae.
               
               Now this Humectation muſt be performed by Meats, Alterative Medicines, Baths, &amp; Topicall Plaiſters. And the Purgation is to be done with all convenient ſpeed, but very gently, and with intermiſſion; for feare of over-heating the Humour. And yet the Humour is many times ſo ſtubborne, as that gentle and eaſie Medicines worke not at all upon it. And therefore it was not unfitly compared, by one, to a troubleſome Garriſon of Souldiers, that are billetted in ſome poore town or other, where they may live as they pleaſe themſelves, no man daring to controwle them. For though they entreat them never ſo kindly, yet ſhall they very hardly be rid of them, without much adoe: But if they give them the leaſt diſtaſt, they will then ſtay there the longer; if it be but to vexe and torment them the more.
               We ſhall doe well then to begin our Purgation with a gentle Clyſter, for to

evacuate the Excrements of the firſt Region of the Body: and we muſt compoſe it of ſome mollifying and Refreſhing Decoction, adding thereto ſome Catholicon, Diaprum. Simp. or the like. The next day we may give our patient a convenient quantity of Caſſia, with a litle Sena Orient, well prepared: or elſe a dramme of Confect. Hamech, or Diaſenna: or, if he pleaſe, he may take a gentler purge, of Catholicon, Tryphera Perſ. and Syrup. Roſar. to which you may adde a quantity of Rhubarbe, and Agaric.
               
               After this Minorative, it will then be time to fall to the preparing of the Humour by Iuleps, or Decoctions: as for example.

               And if you thinke it needfull, you may reiterate it for two or three daies: becauſe that this Melancholy Humour, by reaſon of it's cold, dry, thick, earthy quality, as being a Humour very ſtubborne and rebellious to Nature, hath need of great preparation: wherein the Phyſitian muſt employ himſelfe for many daies together, that ſo at length it may bee the more eaſily wrought upon, and evacuated by the Dejectory Medicines; which I doe in this caſe preferre before Vomits, being encouraged ſo to doe, by the Authority of Hippocrates, who ſaith that 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : Melancholy perſons doe purge more freely and copiouſly by ſiege: (notwithſtanding Arnaldus de Villa Nova holds the contrary:) But in caſe the Patient feele any Crudities in his ſtomack, or any kind of bitter taſt in his mouth; I ſhould then preſcribe him a Vomit: becauſe that this is a ſigne, that the meat he

hath eaten is corrupted in his ſtomack: as both Avicen, and Rhaſis affirme in the above-named places.
               Now therefore after that the Humour hath been thus prepared, we ſhall begin then to purge it, (eſpecially if there be any ſigne of perfect Digeſtion in the Vrine,) with this Dejectory Purge.

               And on the morrow you ſhall give him a litle quantity of Conſerves of Roſes, flowre of Borrage, or of the root of Bugloſſe.
               If you intend to give him a Vomit, then take an ounce of Radiſh roots, a dram of Agaricke, and a dram and a halfe of Aſarum: then boyle all theſe together

in barley water, and taking ten ounces of this Decoction, mixe with it two ounces of Mel Scyllitic. or Syrup of Vinegar, and give it him to drink luke-warme. If you ſhould adde hereto flowre of Broome, the Vomit would work ſo much the better. But take heed of medling with Hellebor, or Antimony: becauſe that ſuch kind of Vomitories are very dangerous.
               The Paracelſians doe uſe to give their Patients in this caſe a kind of gentle Vomit, with ſixe or ſeaven graines of ſal vitriol. which the party muſt take either in wine, or broath: or elſe Vomitivum Pantagogum, and the like: as you may ſee in Rulandus Quercetanus, and other writers of that ſect.
               After this Purgation, you ſhall then give your Patient ſome reſpit for ſome few daies, without giving him any Phyſick at all: and then afterward you ſhall doe well to reiterate your Alterative Medicines of the Humour Peccant, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : ſaith Hippocrates: For the bad Humour muſt be purged out by degrees, and with intermiſſion; that ſo there may be alſo in the

meane while good Humours engendred, and ſubſtituted in their place: Alwaies obſerving the rule that the learned Rondelet in his cap. de Amant. hath ſet downe; where he warneth all Phyſitians, that they admit not into the number of their Alterative Medicaments of the Melancholy Humour, any ſuch as may encreaſe or generate ſeed, (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , as Nonnus calls it:) ſuch as are Eringo roots, Satyrion, and diverſe others of the like quality. For this would be a meanes of adding more ſtrength to the diſeaſe, and ſo render it the more incurable.
               And if the Patient be unwilling to take that other before ſet downe; he may then take Diaſena: or elſe this Magiſtrall Syrup here following, once or twice a moneth.

                  Franciſcus Valleriola added to his Magiſtrall ſyrup that he uſed in the cure of the Merchant of Arles, a dram of Hellebor; but in this point, for my part, I dare not follow him. Notwitſtanding Hippocrates himſelfe very frequently uſed Hellebor in ſuch diſeaſes as this; as appeares plainly out of his works. And by the uſe of this Herbe, Melampus alſo is reported to have cured the Love-ſick Daughter of King Praetus: whence Veratrum, or Hellebor is called ever ſince, Melampodium.
               
               Neither yet dare I adventure to follow the learned Avicen, who in this diſeaſe preſcribes the uſe of Great Ivy. But if thoſe medicines before ſet downe be not of ſtrength ſufficient for the evacuateing

of this rebellious Humour: I would then rather give him three or fowre grains or more, if need be, of Antimony well prepared: which is the advice alſo of all our Moderne Phyſitians.
               Some other of the Paracelſians uſe Turpethum Minerale, and Ladanum Mercuriale; which are not much different.
               Neither doe I much diſlike that powder, of which Haly Abbas makes ſo great brags, and ſaies of it thus. Poſito, quòd aliae Medicinae non valeant; iſta valet, nutu Dei, miſericordis: &amp; eſt Medicina coronata, quae ſecuriſſime teneatur, ut Intellectus Humanus, quaſi deperditus, cum hâc Medicinâ reſtauretur. This Medicine is of ſo approved vertue, as that when all other faile, this alone, by Gods aſſiſtance, will certainly effect the cure of this diſeaſe, even to the reſtoring againe of the underſtanding, if perchance by the violence of the diſeaſe it hath been decaied: and it may very ſafely be taken, and without any danger at all.

                  : as Athenaeus reports.
               After we have thus done, we ſhall then come in the next place to our externall Medicines: among which, Bathes of freſh water are the firſt &amp; chiefeſt: For as much as both P. Aegineta, and Oribaſius, in their ſeverall Tracts of Love, make their boaſts, that they cured diverſe of this diſeaſe of Love-Melancholy, meerely by Bathes of freſh water. And this is confirmed alſo by Avicen, whoſe adviſe is the ſame: Fac ipſos balneari, ſecundùm conditionem Humectationis notam: &amp; alſo by all the Ancient Phyſitians. And we ſhall doe

well to adde hereto ſome other Simples that are of approved vertue againſt this diſeaſe, in manner following.

               Some are of opinion, that it is very good, that in the meane while the Patient is bathing, there ſhould be ſome by, to entertain him with merry Ieſts, &amp; pleaſant diſcourſe, &amp; Muſick, &amp; whatſoever elſe may be thought fit to provoke him to Mirth.
               
                  Aetius adviſeth to apply an Oxyrrhodinum to his head, for to repell the vapors that aſcend up to his head from the ſpermaticall veſſels in men; and in women, from the Matrix, who may alſo in this caſe make uſe of a ſuppoſitory, made of Diacodion, tempered with a litle Vinegar, and the juyce of Sorrell: or elſe a litle quantity of Nitre, and Cardamomum; or elſe a Naſcall, or Peſſary, compoſed of Caſtoreum
                  
mixed with Rue: to which Avicen addes the rootes of Lillies and Nenufar. Or elſe you may make uſe of this Vterine Clyſter, preſcribed by Lodovicus Mercatus.

               But I ſhould rather preferre this other here following.

                  Eros addes to theſe, Opium. Pliny, in his Naturall Hiſtory, and Rondeletius in his 12. booke de Piſcibus, cap. 19. will have the ſecret Parts to be rubbed all over with the gall of a Cramp-fiſh, which is of a marveilous Narcoticke, or Stupefactive vertue: or elſe a Peſſary made of the root of Nymphaea Heraclea.
               
               Briefly, you may find a thouſand ſuch like medicines as theſe, in the writings of Phyſitians that have ſpoken of the cure of this diſeaſe; with which I ſhall not here trouble you. Only thus much for the preſent

I ſhall advertiſe you of, that Nicolaus Monardus, a Phyſitian of Sevill, and Cluſius, ſpeaking of Medicaments that have been lately found out in the Weſtern parts of the world, doe highly magnify, for a ſoveraigne remedy, and Antidote againſt Vnchaſt Love, and Philters, the Powder of a certaine Hearbe called Contra-Yerva, brought not long ſince from Charcys, a Province of Peru, being in ſhape like Corne-flag, and having leaves like Figtree leaves. Which relation of theirs if it be true, we may ſay of this Plant, as Pauſanias did of the fountaine Selemnus, that it would be more worth then all the gold in the world. The like Iudgement doe we give of the ſtone called by the Greekes Selenites, or Aphroſelenum, ſpoken of by Dioſcorides: as alſo of the Amiantus, a certaine ſtone found in Cyprus, which Pliny calls, Linum vivum; Strabo, Carystium; Zoroaſter, Boſtrychitem; Solinus, Carbaſum; ſome others, Corſoidem, Spoliam, &amp; Spartospoliam; and the vulgar call it, though improperly, Stone-Allum: whereof in old time they were wont to make Table-cloathes, that would be made

white only in the fire, and yet never burne.
               
                  Mercurialis, in his 4. book de Morbis Mulier. affirmes, that himſelfe hath cured diverſe both Maids, and married Women of the Vterine Fury, or Love-Madneſſe, by the uſe of cold Minerall waters; ſuch as are thoſe waters in Italy, which they call, The waters of Ʋirgins, or de Ʋilla. But this ſeemes to me a thing incredible, conſidering that (as we have already proved,) it is moſt certaine, that the cure of Love Melancholy, as of all other diſeaſes proceeding from this Humour, conſiſts principally in the Humectation &amp; moyſtening of the Humour: as Galen alſo affirmes. Now all thoſe Authors that have written of Minerall Waters, doe generally agree, that they are of a Deſiccative, or Drying Nature, and therefore ſeeme to be directly contrary to the cure of Love-Melancholy. Yet thus much we may ſay, in the behalfe of Mercurialis, that Minerall waters, notwithſtanding their Dryneſſe, are wholſome in Melancholy diſeaſes, in regard they doe very much coole the Liver, which is the ſeat of this diſeaſe,

opening all Obſtructiōs of the Hypochondries; and alſo comfort the ſtomack, and purge the blood, excerning all the Seroſities and wateriſh parts of it by Vrine and Stoole: as Iohannes Baptiſta Sylvaticus proves at large. Neither yet are all Drying Medicaments to be rejected in the cure of Melancholy diſeaſes: ſeeing that Alexander Trallianus, P. Aegineta, Oribaſius, Avicen, and Rhaſis, preſcribe Epithymum, Hiera, and Hartwort in theſe diſeaſes; and Aetius Vineger alſo: which notwithſtanding, Hippocrates ſaies, doth both ſettle, and increaſe the Melancholy Humour, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
               
               The Phyſitians of France and Germany, doe attribute the ſame vertue to the waters of the Spa. And thoſe of Encauſſe in Gaſcony, notwithſtanding they be of a nature Hot and Dry, are not altogether unproper for the cure of Melancholy diſeaſes, which proceed from the Hypochondries: as I my ſelfe have found by experience.
               
                  Heurnius in his Pract. appoints this Decoction here following, to be uſed inſtead

of theſe Waters above named, in caſe they cannot be had.

               You muſt take the ſame courſe alſo, in the curing of the Symptomes that accompany this diſeaſe, reckoned up in the ſecond Chapter, for which I muſt referre you to the preſcriptions of thoſe Phyſitians that have written hereof: eſpecially Galen, Avicen, and Aëtius. I will onely here ſet down the remedies that are moſt proper for the cure of two of them, and thoſe indeed the moſt dangerous: which are, Continuall Watching, and Extreame Leanneſſe.
               
               For the Firſt of theſe we uſually give Syrup of Poppy, Almonds, Poppy ſeed, and Lettice in Broath. Sometimes I uſe to preſcribe in this caſe foure or five graines of this Opiate, which we may call Nepenthes, or Ladanum.

               You ſhall finde many ſuch Receits as theſe, in Rulandus, Quercetanus, Penot, &amp; diverſe other Chymiſts; which you muſt put in practiſe with very great Circumſpection and Care, and that too, onely in caſe of Extreame Neceſſity: as you muſt alſo doe in the application of Diacodion, and Requies Nicolai.
               But for my own part, I ſhould rather cauſe the party to ſmell to a Noſegay of Violets, Roſes, Gilliflowers; or Marjoram ſteeped in Vineger, wherein hath beene

ſteeped alſo a graine of Camphire, and Opium Or elſe let him uſe this Pomander

               Others apply, though with bad ſucceſſe, Horſeleeches behinde the Eares, &amp; when they take them away, they preſently clap to the place a graine of Opium.
               
               And for the recovering of our Patients fleſh again, we muſt appoint him to drink Aſſes, or Goats milke, putting a litle Sugar into it; and this he muſt doe for the ſpace of a moneth, or thereabout. Or elſe he may uſe this Marchpane here following.

               This Marchpane is very good to procure

ſleep, and it refreſheth and nouriſheth the body withall. But yet this other following is the more Nutritive.
