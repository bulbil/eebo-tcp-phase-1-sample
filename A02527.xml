            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

                     THE RESCVE of Gibeon.
                     
                     
                        THE life of the Gibeonites, muſt coſt thē ſeruitude from Iſrael, and danger from their neighbours: if Ioſhua will but ſit ſtil, the deceit of the Gibeonites ſhall be reuenged by his enemies. Fiue kings are vp in Armes againſt them, and are ready to pay their fraude with

violence: VVhat ſhould theſe poore men doe? If they make not their peace, they die by ſtrangers; if they doe make their peace with Forrainers, they muſt die by neighbours. There is no courſe that threatens not ſome danger; Wee haue ſped well if our choice hath light vpon the eaſieſt inconuenience.
                     If theſe Hiuites haue ſinned againſt God, againſt Iſrael, yet what haue they done to their neighbours? I heare of no trechery, no ſecret information, no attempt. I ſee no ſinne but their league with Iſrael, &amp; their life: yet (for ought we find) they were free men; no way either obliged, or obnoxious. As Satan, ſo wicked men cannot

abide to loſe any of their community: if a Conuert come home, the Angels welcome him with ſongs, the Diuels follow him with vprore and fury, his old Partners vvith ſcornes and obloquy.
                     I finde theſe neighbour Princes halfe dead with feare, and yet they can finde time to be ſick of enuie. Malice in a wicked hart is the king of Paſsions: all other vaile &amp; bow when it comes in place; euen their owne life was not ſo deare to them as reuenge. Who would not rather haue lookt, that theſe Kings ſhould haue tryed to haue followed the Copie of this league? or if their fingers did itch to fight, why did they not rather think of a defenſiue war againſt Iſrael, then

an offenſiue againſt the Gibeonites. Gibeon was ſtrong, and would not bee won without bloud; yet theſe Amorites, which at their beſt were too weake for Iſrael, would ſpend their forces before hand on their neighbors. Here was a ſtrong hatred in weake breaſts: they feared, and yet began to fight; they feared Jſrael, yet began to fight with Gibeon. If they had ſat ſtill, their deſtruction had not beene ſo ſuddaine: the malice of the wicked, haſtens the paſe of their owne iudgement. No rod is ſo fit for a miſchieuous man, as his owne.
                     
                        Gibeon, and theſe other Cities of the Hiuites, had no King: &amp; none yeelded, and eſcaped, but they. Their Elders conſulted before for

their league; neither is there any challenge ſent to the King, but to the Citie: And now the fiue Kings of the Amorits haue vniuſtly compacted againſt them. Soueraignty abuſed, is a great ſpur to out-rage; the conceit of authoritie in great perſons, many times lies in the way of their own ſafety, whiles it vvill not let them ſtoope to the ordinarie courſes of inferiours. Hence it is, that heauen is peopled with ſo few Great-ones: hence it is, that true contentment ſeldome dwells high; whiles meaner men of humbled ſpirits, enioy both earth and heauen.
                     The Gibeonites had wel proued that thogh they wanted an Head, yet they wanted not wit; and now

the ſame wit that won Ioſhua and Iſrael to their friendſhip and protection, teacheth them to make vſe of thoſe they had won. If they had not more truſted Ioshua, then their walls, they had neuer ſtolne that league; &amp; whē ſhold they haue vſe of their new Protectors, but now that they were aſſailed? Whither ſhould wee fly but to our Ioshua, when the powers of darknes (like mighty Amorites) haue beſieged vs? If euer wee will ſend vp our prayers to him, it will be, when we are beleaguered with euils. If we truſt to our owne reſiſtance, wee cannot ſtand; we cannot miſcary, if we truſt to his: in vaine ſhall we ſend to our Ioshua in theſe ſtraits, if we haue not before come to him in our freedom.
                     
                        
Which of vs would not haue thought Ioshua had a good pretence for his forbearance; &amp; haue ſaid, You haue ſtolne your league with me; why do you expect help from him whom yee haue deceiued? All that wee promiſed you, was a ſufferance to liue; inioy what wee promiſed, wee will not take your life from you; Hath your faithfulnes deſerued to expect more then our couenant; we neuer promiſed to hazard our liues for you, to giue you life with the loſſe of our owne. But that good man durſt not conſtrue his owne couenant to ſuch an aduantage; Hee knew little difference betwixt killing them with his own ſword, and the ſword of an Amorite: vvhoſoeuer ſhould giue the

blow, the murder would bee his. Euen permiſsion in thoſe things wee may remedy, makes vs no leſſe actors then conſent; ſome men kill as much by looking on, as others by ſmiting: VVee are guilty of all the euill wee might haue hindered.
                     The noble diſpoſition of Ioſhua, beſides his ingagement, will not let him forſake his new vaſſalls: Their confidence in him, is argument enough to draw him into the Field. The greateſt obligation to a good mind, is anothers truſt▪ which to diſappoint, were mercileſly perfidious. How much leſſe ſhall our true Ioshua faile the confidence of our faith? Oh my Sauiour, if we ſend the meſſengers o
                           •
                        
                        
our prayers to thee into thy Gilgal, thy mercy bindes thee to releefe: neuer any ſoule miſcaried that truſted thee; we may be wanting in our truſt, our truſt can neuer want ſucceſs.
                     Speed in beſtowing, doubles a gift; a benefit deferred, loſes the thanks, and prooues vnprofitable. Ioshua marches all night, &amp; fights all day for the Gibeonites: They tooke not ſo much pains in comming to deceiue him, as he in going to deliuer them. It is the nobleſt victory to ouercome euill with good; if his very Iſraelites had been in danger he could haue done no more: God, and his Ioshua, make no difference betwixt Gibeonites Iſraelited, and his owne

naturall people. All are Iſraelites whom he hath taken to league: we ſtrangers of the Gentiles, are now the true Iewes; GOD neuer did more for the naturall Oliue, then for that wild Impe which he hath graffed in. And as theſe Hiuites could neuer be thankfull enough to ſuch a Ioshua; no more can we to ſo gracious a Redeemer, vvho forgetting our vnwoorthineſs, deſcended to our Gibeon, and reſcued vs from the powers of hell, and death.
                     
                        Ioshua fought, but God diſcomfited the Amorites; The praiſe is to the workman, not the inſtrument: Neither did God ſlay them onely with Ioshua's ſword, but with his owne haile-ſtones; that now the

                        Amorites may ſee both theſe reuenges come frō one hand. Theſe bullets of GOD doe not wound, but kill: It is no wonder that theſe fiue Kings flie; They may ſoone run away from their hope, neuer from their horror: If they looke behind, there is the ſword of Iſrael, which they dare not turn vpon, becauſe God had taken their hart from them, before their life: If they looke vpwards, there is the haile-ſhot of God fighting againſt them, out of heauen; which they can neither reſiſt, nor auoyd.
                     If they had no enemy but Iſrael, they might hope to runne away from death, ſith feare is a better footeman, then deſire of reuenge; but novv, vvhither-ſoeuer they

runne, heauen will be aboue their heads: And now, all the reaſon that is left them in this confuſion of their thoughts, is to wiſh themſelues well dead; there is no euaſion where GOD intends a reuenge. Wee men haue deuiſed to imitate theſe inſtruments of death, and ſend foorth deadly bullets out of a clowd of ſmoke; wherein yet, as there is much danger, ſo much vncertaintie: but this God, that diſcharges his Ordinance from heauen, directs euery ſhotte to an head, and can as eaſily kil as ſhoot. It is a fearfull thing to fall into the hands of the liuing God: hee hath mo waies of vengeance, then hee hath creatures. The ſame heauen that ſent foorth water to the old world, fire to the Sodomites, lightning

and thunderbolts to the Egyptians, ſends out haile-ſtones to the Amorites. It is a good care how wee may not anger God; it is a vain ſtudy how we may fly from his iudgements, when wee haue angred him; if wee could run out of the vvorld, euen there ſhall we finde his reuenges far greater.
                     Was it not miracle enough that God did braine their Aduerſaries from heauen, but that the Sunne and Moone muſt ſtand ſtil in heauen? Is it not enough that the Amorites fly, but that the greateſt Planets of heauen muſt ſtay their owne courſe, to witneſſe, and wonder at the diſcomfiture? For him which gaue them both beeing and motion, to bid them ſtand ſtill, it

ſeemes no difficulty, although the rarenes would deſerue admiration: but, for a man to commaund the chiefe ſtarres of heauen (by whoſe influence he liueth) as the Centurion would do his ſeruant, Sunne ſtay in Gibeon, and Moone ſtand ſtill in Aialon, it is more then a wonder. It was not Ioshua, but his faith that did this; not by way of precept, but of prayer. If I may not ſay that the requeſt of a faithfull man (as wee ſay of the great) commaunds, Gods glorie vvas that which Ioshua aimed at: hee knew that all the world muſt needs be witneſſes of that, which the eye of the world ſtood ſtill to ſee. Had he reſpected but the ſlaughter of the Amorites, hee knew the haile-ſtones could doe that alone; the

Sunne needed not ſtand ſtill to direct that clowd to perſecute them; but the glory of the ſlaughter was ſought by Ioshua, that hee might ſend that vp, whence thoſe haile-ſtones, and that victory came: All the earth might ſee the Sunne and Moon; all could not ſee the cloud of haile, which becauſe of that heauie burden flew but low. That all Nations might knowe the ſame hand commands both in earth, in the clouds, in heauen, Ioshua now prayes, that hee which dishartned his enemies vpon earth, &amp; ſmote them from the cloud, would ſtay the Sunne and Moone in heauen. God neuer got himſelfe ſo much honour by one dayes worke amongſt the heathen; and vvhen was it more fitte, then now, vvhen

fiue heathen Kings are banded againſt him?
                     The Sun and the Moone were the ordinary Gods of the world: and who would not but think, that their ſtanding ſtill but one houre, ſhould be the ruine of Nature? &amp; now, all Nations ſhall well ſee, that there is an higher then their higheſt; that their Gods are but ſeruants to the GOD whom themſelues ſhould ſerue, at whoſe pleaſure both they and Nature ſhall ſtand at once. If that God which meant to work this miracle, had not raiſed vp his thoughts to deſire it, it had bin a blameable preſumption, which now is a faith vvorthy of admiration. To deſire a miracle without cauſe, is a tempting

of God. O powerfull GOD that can effect this! O power of faith that can obtaine it! What is there that God cannot doe? and what is there which God can doe, that faith cannot doe?
                  
                  
                     
                     
                     THE ALTAR of the Reubenites.
                     
                     
                        
                           REuben, and Gad, were the firſt that had an inheritance aſsigned thē; yet they muſt inioy it laſt: So it falls out oft in the heauenly Canaan, the firſt in title, are the laſt in poſſeſsion. They had their lot aſsigned them beyond Iorden; which tho it were allotted them in peace, muſt be purchaſed with their war: that muſt be done for their brethren, which needed not be done for themſelues: they muſt yet ſtill fight, and fight for-moſt,

that as they had the firſt patrimonie, they might indure the firſt incounter. I do not hear them ſay, This is our ſhare, let vs ſitte downe, and enioy it quietly, fight who will for the reſt: but when they knew their own portion, they leaue wiues and children to take poſſeſsion, and march armed before their brethren, till they had conquered all Canaan. Whether ſhould wee more commend their courage, or their charitie? Others were mooued to fight with hope, they onely with loue: they could not winne more, they might loſe themſelues; yet they wil fight, both for that they had ſomething, and that their brethren might haue. Thankfulneſſe and loue can doe more with Gods children, then

deſire to merit, or neceſsitie: No true Iſraelite can (if hee might chuſe) abide to ſitte ſtill beyond Iordan, when all his brethren are in the field. Now when all this war of God was ended, and all Canaan is both won and diuided, they returne to their owne; yet not till they were diſmiſſed by Ioshua: all the ſweet attractiues of their priuate loue cannot haſten their paſe. If heauen be neuer ſo ſweet to vs, yet may we not runne from this earthen warfare till our great Captaine ſhall pleaſe to diſcharge vs. If theſe Reubenites had departed ſooner, they had been recalled, if not as cowards, ſurelie as fugitiues; now they are ſent back with victorie and bleſsing. How ſafe and happie it is to attend

both the call, and the diſpatch of GOD!
                     Beeing returned in peace to their home, their firſt care is, not for Trophees; nor for houſes, but for an Altar to God; an Altar, not for ſacrifice, which had been abominable, but for a memoriall what God they ſerued. The firſt care of true Iſraelites, muſt be the ſafetie of Religion; the world, as it is inferiour in worth, ſo muſt it be in reſpect: Hee neuer knew God aright, that can abide any competition with his Maker.
                     The reſt of the Tribes no ſooner heare newes of their new Altar, but they gather to Shiloh, to fight againſt them: they had ſcarce

breathed from the Cananitiſh war, and now they will goe fight with their brethren: if their brethren will (as they ſuſpected) turne Idolaters, they cannot hold them any other then Canaanites. The Reubenites &amp; their fellowes, had newly ſettled the reſt of Iſrael in their poſseſsions, and now ere they can be warme in their ſeates, Iſrael is vp in Armes to thruſt them out of their owne: the hatred of their ſuſpected Idolatry, makes them forget either their bloud, or their benefits. Iſrael ſayes, Theſe men were the firſt in our battels, and ſhall be the firſt in our reuenge; They fought well for vs, wee will try how they can fight for themſelues. VVhat if they were our Champions? Their reuolt from

God hath loſt them the thanke of their former labours; their Idolatry ſhall make them of brethren, aduerſaries; their own bloud ſhall giue handſell to their new Altar. O noble and religious zeale of Iſrael! Who would think theſe men the ſonnes of them that danced about the molten Calfe? That conſecrated an Altar to that Idol? Now they are ready to die or kill, rather then endure an Altar without an Idol. Euery ouerture in matter of Religion, is woorthie of ſuſpicion, worthie of our ſpeedie oppoſition: God lookes for an early redreſſe of the firſt beginnings of impietie. As in treaſons or mutinies, wiſe ſtateſ-men find it ſafeſt to kill the ſerpent in the egge; ſo in motions of ſpirituall

alterations: one ſpoonefull of water will quench that fire at the firſt, which afterwards whole buckets cannot abate.
                     Yet doe not theſe zealous Iſraelires runne raſhly and furiouſlie vpon their brethren, nor ſay, What need wee expoſtulate? The fact is cleare: what care wee for words, when wee ſee their Altar? What can this meane, but either ſeruice to a falſe God, or diuiſion in the ſeruice of the true? There can bee no excuſe for ſo manifeſt a crime: Why doe we not rather thinke of puniſhment, then ſatisfaction? But they ſend ere they goe; and conſult ere they execute. Phineas the ſonne of Eleazar the Prieſt, and ten Princes (for euery Tribe one)

are addreſſed both to inquire, &amp; diſſwade; to inquire of the purpoſe of the fact; to diſſwade from that which they imagined was purpoſed. Wiſedome is a good guide to zeale, and onely can keepe it from running out into furie: If diſcretion doe not hold in the raynes, good intentions wil both breake their owne necks, and the riders: yea, which is ſtrange, without this, the zeale of God, may leade vs from God.
                     Not onely wiſedome, but charitie mooued them to this meſſage. For, grant they had beene guiltie, muſt they periſh vnwarn'd? Peaceable meanes muſt firſt be vſed to recall them, ere violence be ſent to perſecute them. The old rule

of Iſrael, hath been ſtill to inquire of Abel; No good Shepheard ſends his dog to pul out the throat of his ſtrayed ſheepe, but rather fetches it on his ſhoulders to the fold: Sudden crueltie ſtands not with religion: He which will not himſelfe breake the bruiſed reed, how will hee allow vs, either to bruiſe the whole, or to breake the bruiſed, or to burne the broken?
                     Neither yet was here more charitie in ſending, then vncharitableneſs in the miſconſtruction. They begin with a challenge; &amp; charge their brethren deeply with tranſgreſsion, apoſtaſie, rebellion. I know not how two contrary qualities fall into loue; it is not naturally ſuſpicious, &amp; yet many times

ſuggeſts iealous feares of thoſe we affect. If theſe Iſraelites had not loued their brethren, they wold neuer haue ſent ſo farre to reſtraine them; they had neuer offred them part of their owne patrimonie: if they had not been exceſsiuely iealous, they had not cenſured a doubtfull action, ſo ſharply. They met at Shilo, where the Tabernacle was; but if they had conſulted with the Arke of God, they had ſaued both this labor, &amp; this challenge: This caſe ſeemed ſo plain, that they thought aduice needleſs: Their inconſiderateneſs therefore brands their brethren with crimes whereof they were innocent; and makes themſelues the onely offenders. In caſes which are doubtfull and vncertaine, it is ſafe either

to ſuſpend the iudgement, or to paſſe it in fauor; otherwiſe, a plain breach of charitie in vs, ſhall bee worſe then a queſtionable breach of iuſtice in another.
                     Yet this little gleame of their vncharitable loue began at themſelues; if they had not feared their owne iudgements in the offence of Ruben, I knowe not whether they had been ſo vehement: The fearefull reuenges of their bretherens ſinne are ſtill in their eye. The wickednes of Peor, ſtretched not ſo farre as the plague; Achan ſinned, and Iſrael was beaten: therefore by iuſt induction, they argue (Ye rebel to day againſt the Lord, tomorrow wil the Lord be wroth with all the Congregation.) They

ſtill tremble at the vengeance paſſed; and finde it time to preuent their own puniſhment, in puniſhing their brethren. Gods proceedings haue then their right vſe, when they are both carefully remembred, and made patterns of what he may doe.
                     Had theſe Reubenites been as hot in their anſwere, as the Iſraelites were in their charge, heere had grown a bloudy warre out of miſpriſion: But now their anſwer is milde and moderate, and ſuch as wel ſhewed, that though they were further from the Arke, yet no leſſe neer to GOD. They thought in thēſelues, This act of ours, though it were wel meant by vs, yet might well be by interpretation ſcandalous;

it is reaſon our mildneſſe ſhould giue ſatisfaction for that offence, vvhich we haue not preuented. Heereupon, their anſwer was as pleaſing, as their act vvas dangerous. Euen in thoſe actions whereby an offence may be occaſioned (though not giuen) charitie bindes vs to cleare both our owne name, and the conſcience of others.
                     Little did the Iſraelites looke for ſo good a ground of an action ſo ſuſpicious; An Altar vvithout a ſacrifice? An Altar and no Tabernacle? An Altar without a precept, and yet not againſt God? It is not ſafe to meaſure all mens actions by our owne conceit, but rather to thinke there may bee a

further drift, and warrant of their act, then we can attaine to ſee.
                     By that time the Reubenites haue commented vpon their owne vvorke, it appeares as iuſtifiable, as before offenſiue. What vviſedome and religion is found in that Altar, which before ſhowed nothing but Idolatry? This diſcourſe of theirs, is full both of reaſon and pietie; We are ſeuered by the riuer Iordan from the other Tribes; perhaps heereafter, our choice may exclude vs from Iſrael: Poſteritie may peraduenture ſay, Iordan is the bounds of all natural Iſraelites; the ſtreames whereof neuer gaue way to thoſe beyond the Riuer: If they had beene ours, either in bloud or religion, they

would not haue been ſequeſtred in habitation. Doubtleſſe therfore theſe men are the ofspring of ſom Strangers, which by vicinity of abode, haue gotten ſome tincture of our language, manners, religion; What haue wee to doe with them, what haue they to doe with the Tabernacle of God? Sith therfore we may not either remooue Gods Altar to vs, or remoue our Patrimonie to the Altar; The Patterne of the Altar ſhall go with vs, not for ſacrifice, but for memoriall; that both the poſterity of the other Iſraelites may know, we are no leſſe deriued from them, then this Altar from theirs; &amp; that our poſterity may know, they pertain to that Altar, whereof this is the reſemblance. There was no danger

of the preſent; but poſteritie might both offer and receiue preiudice, if this Monumēt were not. It is a wiſe &amp; holy care to preuent the dangers of enſuing times, and to ſettle religion vpon the ſucceeding generations. As we affect to leaue a perpetuity of our bodilie iſſue, ſo much more to traduce pietie with them. Doe wee not ſee good husbands ſet and plant thoſe trees, whereof their grand-children ſhall receiue the firſt fruit, &amp; ſhade? Why are we leſſe thrifty in leauing true religion intire, to our childrens children?
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        Ehud and Eglon.
                     
                     
                        AS euery man is guiltie of his own ſorrow, theſe Iſraelites bred miſchiefe to themſelues: It vvas their mercy that plagued them with thoſe Canaanites, which their obedience ſhold haue rooted out. If fooliſh pitty be a more humane ſinne, yet it is no leſſe dangerous then crueltie: Cruelty kils others, vniuſt pittie kills our ſelues. They had beene Lords alone of the promiſed Land, if their commiſeration had not ouer-ſwayed their iuſtice; and now their enemies are

too cruell to them (in the iuſt reuenge of God) becauſe they were too merciful: That God, which in his reuealed will had commanded all the Canaanites to the ſlaughter, yet ſecretly giues ouer Iſrael to a toleration of ſome Canaanites, for their own puniſhment. Hee hath bidden vs cleanſe our hearts of all our corruptions: yet hee will permit ſome of theſe thornes ſtill in our ſides, for exerciſe, for humiliation. If wee could lay violent hands vpon our ſinnes, our ſoules ſhould haue peace; now our indulgence coſts vs many ſtripes, &amp; many teares: what a continued circle is heere of ſins, iudgements; repentance, deliuerances? The conuerſation with Idolaters, taints them with ſinne; their ſin drawes

on iudgements; the ſmart of the iudgement moues them to repentance; vpon their repentance followes ſpeedy deliuerance, vpon their peace and deliuerance they ſinne againe.
                     
                        Othniel, Calebs nephew, had reſcued them from Idolatry and ſeruitude: his life, and their innocence and peace ended together. How powerfull the preſence of one good man is in a Church or State, is beſt found in his loſſe.
                     A man that is at once eminent in place &amp; goodnes, is like a ſtake in a hedge; pull that vp, and all the reſt are but looſe and rotten ſticks, eaſily remoued: or like the piller of a vaulted roofe, which

either ſupports, or ruines the building. Who would not think Idolatry an abſurd and vnnaturall ſin? which as it hath the feweſt inducements, ſo had alſo the moſt direct inhibitions from God; and yet after all theſe warnings, Iſrael falls into it againe: Neither affliction nor repentance can ſecure an Iſraelite from redoubling the worſt ſinne, if he be left to his own frailtie. It is no cenſuring of the truth of our preſent ſorow, by the euent of a following miſcariage; The former cryes of Iſrael to God were vnfained, yet their preſent wickedneſs is abhominable: Let him that thinks he ſtands, take heed leaſt hee fall.
                     
                        
No ſooner had hee ſaid (Iſrael had reſt) but he addes, They committed wickedneſſe: The ſecuritie of any people is the cauſe of their corruption; ſtanding waters ſoone grow noyſom. Whiles they were exerciſed with warre, how ſcrupulous were they of the leaſt intimation of Idolatry? the newes of a bare Altar beyond Iordan, drew them together for a rèuenge; now they are at peace with their enemies, they are at variance vvith God: It is both hard &amp; happy not to be the worſe with liberty; The ſedentary life is moſt ſubiect to diſeaſes.
                     Rather then Iſrael ſhall want a ſcourge for their ſinne, God him ſelfe ſhall raiſe them vp an enemy:

                        Moab had no quarrell but his own ambition, but God meant by the ambition of the one part, to puniſh the Idolatry of the other; his iuſtice can make one ſin the executioner of another, whiles neither ſhall looke for any other meaſure from him, but iudgement: The euill of the Citie is ſo his, that the inſtrument is not guiltleſs. Before, God had ſtirred vp the King of Syria againſt Iſrael; now, the King of Moab; afterwards, the King of Canaan: Hee hath more varietie of iudgements, then there can be offences; if we haue once made him our aduerſary, he ſhall bee ſure to make vs aduerſaries enovv; vvhich ſhall reuenge his quarrell, vvhiles they proſecute their owne.
                     
                        
Euen thoſe were Idolaters by whoſe hands God plagued the Idolatries of Iſrael. In Moab, the ſame wickednes proſpers, which in Gods owne people is puniſhed: the iuſtice of the Almightie can leaſt brooke euill in his owne; the ſame heathen which prouoked Iſrael to ſinne, ſhall ſcourge them for ſinning. Our very profeſsion hurts vs, if we be not innocent.
                     No leſſe then eighteene yeares did the rod of Moab reſt vpon the inheritance of God: Iſrael ſeemes as borne to ſeruitude; they came from their bondage in the Land of Egypt, to ſerue in the Land of Promiſe; They had neglected God, now they are neglected of GOD; Their ſinnes haue made

them ſeruants, whom the choice of GOD had made free, yea his firſt borne. Woorthy are they to ſerue thoſe men, whoſe falſe Gods they had ſerued, &amp; to ſerue them alwaies in thraldome, whom they haue once ſerued in Idolatry. We may not meaſure the continuance of puniſhment, by the time of the commiſsion of ſinne; one minutes ſin deſerues a torment beyond all time.
                     Doubtleſſe, Iſrael was not ſo inſenſible of their own miſery, as not to complain ſooner then the end of eighteene yeeres; The firſt houre they ſighed for themſelues, but now they cried vnto GOD. The very purpoſe of affliction is to make vs importunate; Hee that

heares the ſecret murmurs of our griefe, yet will not ſeeme to heare vs, till our cryes be loud &amp; ſtrong. GOD ſees it beſt to let the penitent dwell for the time vnder their ſorrowes; hee ſees vs ſinking all the while, yet he lets vs alone till wee be at the bottome: and when once we can ſay, Out of the depths haue I cryed to thee; inſtantly followes, The Lord heard me. A vehement ſuter cannot but be heard of God, whatſoeuer hee askes. If our prayers want ſucceſſe, they want hart; their bleſsing is according to their vigour. Wee liue in bondage to theſe ſpirituall Moabites, our owne corruptions. It diſcontents vs; but where are our ſtrong cries vnto the GOD of heauen? where are our teares? If

wee could paſsionately bemone our ſelues to him, hovv ſoone ſhould we be more then conquerours? Some good motions wee haue to ſend vp to him, but they faint in the way. We may call long enough, if we cry not to him.
                     The ſame hand that raiſed vp Eglon againſt Iſrael, raiſed vp alſo Ehud for Iſrael, againſt Eglon; When that Tyrant hath reuenged God of his people, God will reuenge his people of him. It is no priuiledge to be an inſtrument of Gods vengeance by euil meanes: Though Eglon were an Vſurper, yet had Ehud beene a Traytor if God had not ſent him; it is onelie in the power of him that makes Kings, when they are once ſettled,

to depoſe them. It is no more poſſible for our moderne butchers of Princes, to ſhow they are imployed by God, then to eſcape the reuenge of GOD in offering to doe this violence, not being imployed.
                     VVhat a ſtrange choice dooth God make of an Executioner? A man ſhut of his right hand; either he had but one hand, or vſed but one, and that the worſe, and more vnready: Who would not haue thought both hands too little for ſuch a worke; or, if either might haue been ſpared, how much rather the left? GOD ſeeth not as man ſeeth; It is the ordinary wont of the Almightie, to make choice of the vnlik elieſt meanes. The inſtruments

of God muſt not bee meaſured by their own power, or aptitude, but by the will of the Agent: Tho Ehud had no hands, he that imployed him, had enabled him to this ſlaughter. In humane things, it is good to looke to the meanes; in diuine, to the worker; No meanes are to be contemned that God will vſe; no meanes to be truſted that man will vſe without him.
                     It is good to be ſuſpicious where is leaſt ſhow of danger, and moſt appearance of fauour. This lefthanded man comes with a preſent in his hand, but a dagger vnder his skirt. The Tyrant, beſides ſeruice, lookt for gifts; and now receiues death in his bribe: Neither

God nor men, doe alwaies giue where they loue. How oft dooth God giue extraordinary illumination, power of miracles, beſides wealth and honor, where he hates? So doe men too oft accompanie their curſes with preſents; either leaſt an enemy ſhould hurt vs, or that wee may hurt them. The intention is the fauour in gifts, and not the ſubſtance.
                     
                        Ehuds faith ſupplies the want of his hand: Where GOD intends ſucceſs, he lifts vp the hart with reſolutions of courage, &amp; contempt of danger. What indifferent beholder of this proiect would not haue condemned it, as vnlikely to ſpeed; To ſee a maimed man goe alone to a great King, in the midſt

of all his troupes; to ſingle him out from all witneſſes; to ſet vpon him with one hand in his owne Parlor, where his Courtiers might haue heard the leaſt exclamation, and haue comne in, if not to the reſcue, yet to the reuenge. Euery circumſtance is full of improbabilities: Faith euermore ouerlookes the difficulties of the way, &amp; bends her eyes onely to the certainty of the end. In this inteſtine ſlaughter of our tyrannicall corruptions, when we caſt our eyes vpon our ſelues, we might well deſpaire; Alas, what can our left-hands doe againſt theſe ſpirituall wickedneſſes? But when wee ſee who hath both commaunded, and vndertaken to proſper theſe holy deſignes, how can wee miſdoubt the

ſucceſs? I can doe all things throgh him that ſtrengthens me.
                     
                     When Ehud hath obtained the conuenient ſecrecie both of the weapon &amp; place; now with a confident forhead he approaches the Tyrant, and ſalutes him, vvith a true and awfull preface to ſo important an act. I haue a meſsage to thee from God. Euen Ehuds poynard was Gods meſſage; not onely the vocall admonitions, but alſo the reall iudgements of God, are his errands to the world. Hee ſpeakes to vs in raine &amp; waters, in ſickneſſes &amp; famine, in vnſeaſonable times &amp; inundations: Theſe are the ſecondary meſſages of God; if we will not hear the firſt, we muſt heare theſe to our coſt.
                     
                        
I cannot but wonder at the deuout reuerence of this Heathen Prince; Hee ſate in his Chaire of State; The vnweildineſſe of his fat body was ſuch, that he could not riſe with readineſs and eaſe; yet no ſooner doth he heare newes of a meſſage from God, but hee riſes vp from his Throne, &amp; reuerently attends the tenor therof: Though hee had no Superior to controle him, yet hee cannot abide to bee vnmannerly in the buſineſſe of GOD.
                     This man was an Idolater, a Tyrant: yet what outward reſpects doth he giue to the true God? Externall ceremonies of pietie, and complements of deuotion, may well be found with falſhood in religion.

They are a good ſhadow of truth where it is: but where it is not, they are the very body of hypocriſie. Hee that had riſen vp in Armes againſt Gods people, and the true worſhip of God, now riſes vp in reuerence to his Name: GOD would haue liked well to haue had leſs of his curteſie, more of his obedience.
                     He lookt to haue heard the meſſage with his eares, and he feeles it in his guttes; So ſharp a meſſage, that it pierced the body, &amp; let out the ſoule through that vncleane paſſage: neither did it admit of any aunſwer, but ſilence and death. In that part had hee offended by pampering it, and making it his God; and now his bane findes the

ſame way with his ſinne. This one hard and cold morſell, which hee cannot digeſt, payes for all thoſe gluttonous delicates, whereof he had formerly ſurfeted. It is the manner of God, to take fearefull reuenges of the profeſſed enemies of his Church.
                     It is a maruell, that neither any noiſe in his dying, nor the fall of ſo groſs a body, called-in ſome of his attendants: But that GOD, which hath intended to bring about any deſigne, diſpoſes of all circumſtances to his owne purpoſe. If Ehud had not come forth with a calme and ſettled countenaunce, and ſhut the doores after him, all his proiect had been in the duſt. What had it been better that

the King of Moab was ſlaine, if Iſrael had neither had a meſſenger to informe, nor a Captain to guide them? Now hee departs peaceably, &amp; blowes a trumpet in Mount Ephraim, gathers Iſrael, and falls vpon the body of Moab, as well as hee had done vpon the head, and procures freedome to his people. Hee that would vndertake great enterpriſes, had need of wiſdome, and courage; wiſedome to contriue, and courage to execute; wiſedome to guide his courage, &amp; courage to ſecond his wiſedome: both which, if they meet with a good cauſe, cannot but ſucceed.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        Iael and Siſera.
                     
                     
                        IT is no wonder if they vvho ere foure-ſcore dayes after the Law deliuered, fell to Idolatry alone, now after foure-ſcore yeeres ſince the Law reſtored, fell to Idolatry among the Canaanites: Peace could in a ſhorter time work 
                           •
                        ooſeneſs in any people: and if for

                        ance, they relapſed, what marvell is it that in twiſe fortie after E
                           
                              •
                           ud, they thus miſcaried? VVhat 
                           •
                        re they the better to haue killed Eglon the King of Moab, if the Idolatry

of Moab haue killed them? The ſinne of Moab ſhal be found a worſe Tyrant then their Eglon. Iſrael is for euery market; they ſold themſelues to Idolatry, God ſells them to the Canaanites; it is no maruell they are ſlaues, if they wil be Idolaters: After their longeſt intermiſsion, they haue now the ſoreſt bondage. None of their Tyrants were ſo potent as Iabin with his 900. chariots of Iron. The longer the reckoning is deferred, the greater is the ſumme: God prouides on purpoſe mighty Aduerſaries for his Church, that their humiliation may bee the greater in ſuſtaining, and his glory may be greater in deliuerance.
                     
                        
I doe not finde any Prophet in Iſrael during their ſin; but ſo ſoone as I heare newes of their repentance, mention is made of a Propheteſſe, &amp; Iudge of Iſrael. There is no better ſigne of Gods reconciliation, then the ſending of his holy meſſengers to any people; He is not vtterly fallen out vvith thoſe whom hee bleſſes with prophecie. Whom yet doe I ſee rayſed to this honour? Not any of the Princes of Iſrael; not Barac the Captaine; not Lapidoth the huſband; but a woman, for the honor of her ſex; a wife, for the honor of wedlock: Deborah, the wife of Lapidoth.
                     
                     Hee that had choice of all the millions of Iſrael, culls out two

weake women, to deliuer his people; Deborah ſhall iudge, Iael ſhall execute. All the Palaces of Iſrael, muſt yeeld to the Palme-tree of Deborah; The weakeneſſe of the inſtruments, redounds to the greater honour of the workman. Who ſhall aske God any reaſon of his elections, but his owne pleaſure? Deborah was to ſentence, not to ſtrike; to commaund, not to execute: This act is maſculine, fit for ſome Captaine of Iſrael; She was the Head of Iſrael, it was meet ſom other ſhould be the hand: it is an imperfect and titular gouernment vvhere there is a commaunding power, without correction, without execution. The meſſage of Deborah findes out Barac the ſon of Abinoam, in his obſcure ſecrecie,

and calls him from a corner of Nepthali, to the honour of this exploit. Hee is ſent for, not to gette the victory, but to take it; not to ouercome, but to kill; to purſue, &amp; not to beat Siſera. Who could not haue done this work, whereto not much courage, no skill belonged? Yet euen for this wil God haue an inſtrument of his ovvne choice: It is moſt fit that GOD ſhold ſerue himſelfe where he liſt, of his owne; neither is it to be inquired, whom we thinke meet for any imployment, but whom God hath called.
                     
                        Deborah had beene no Propheteſſe, if ſhee durſt haue ſent in her owne name; Her meſſage is from him that ſent herſelfe, Hath not the

Lord God of Iſrael commaunded? Baracs anſwer is faithfull, tho conditionate; and doth not ſo much intend a refuſall to goe without her, as a neceſſary bond of her preſence vvith him. VVho can blame him that hee would haue a Propheteſſe in his cōpany? If the man had not been as holy as valiant, he wold not haue wiſhed ſuch ſocietie. How many thinke it a perpetual bondage to haue a prophet of God at their elbow? God had neuer ſent for him ſo farre, if he could haue bin content to goe vp without Deborah; Hee knew that there was both a bleſsing, and incouragement in that preſence. It is no putting any truſt in the ſucceſs of thoſe men, that neglect the meſſengers of God.
                     
                        
To preſcribe that to others, which we draw back from dooing our ſelues, is an argument of hollowneſs and falſity: Barac ſhall ſee that Deborah doth not offer him that cup, whereof ſhe dare not beginne; without regard of her ſexe ſhee marches with him to Mount Tabor, and reioyces to be ſeen of the tenne thouſand of Iſrael. With what ſcorne did Siſera looke at theſe gleanings of Iſrael? How vnequall did this match ſeeme of ten thouſand Iſraelites againſt his three hundred thouſand foot, ten thouſand horſe, nine hundred chariots of Iron? And now in a brauery, he calls for his troupes, and meanes to kill this handfull of Iſrael with the very ſight of his piked chariots; and onely feared it

would be no victory to cutte the throates of ſo few. The faith of Deborah and Barac was not appalled with this world of Aduerſaries, which from Mount Tabor they ſaw hiding all the Vally belowe them; they knew whom they had belieued, and how little an arme of fleſh could do againſt the God of Hoſts.
                     
                        Barac went down againſt Siſera, but it was GOD that deſtroyed him. The Iſraelites did not this day wield their owne ſwords, leaſt they ſhould arrogate any thing; God told them before hand, it ſhould be his own act. I heare not of one ſtroke that any Canaanite gaue in this fight; as if they were called hither, onely to ſuffer.

And now proud Siſera, after many curſes of the heauineſſe of that Iron carriage, is gladde to quit his Chariot, and betake himſelfe to his heeles. Who euer yet knew any earthly thing truſted in, without diſappointment? It is wonder if God make vs not at laſt as weary of whatſoeuer hath ſtolne our harts from him, as euer wee were fond.
                     Yet Siſera hopes to haue ſped better then his followers, in ſo ſeaſonable an harbour of Iael. If Heber and Iael had not been great perſons, there had beene no note taken of their Tents; There had been no league betwixt King Iabin and them: now their greatnes makes them known, their league

makes them truſted. The diſtreſſe of Siſera might haue made him importunate, but Iael begins the curteſie, and exceeds the deſire of her gueſt: Hee askes vvater to drinke, ſhee giues him milke; hee wiſhes but ſhelter, ſhee makes him a bed; hee deſires the protection of her Tent, ſhe couers him with a mantle. And now Siſera pleaſes himſelfe with this happy change, and thinks how much better it is to be here, then in that whirling of chariots, in that horror of flight, amongſt thoſe ſhriekes, thoſe woundes, thoſe carcaſſes. Whiles hee is in theſe thoughts: his wearineſs &amp; eaſie repoſall hath brought him aſleepe. VVho would haue looked that in this tumult and danger, euen betwixt the very iawes

of death, Siſera ſhould finde time to ſleepe? How many vvorldlie harts doe ſo in the midſt of their ſpirituall perils?
                     Now whiles hee was dreaming, doubtleſſe, of the claſhing of armors, ratling of chariots, neighing of horſes, the clamor of the conquered, the furious purſute of Iſrael; Iael ſeeing his temples lie ſo faire, as if they inuited the naile &amp; hammer, entred into the thought of this noble execution; certainly not without ſom checks of doubt, and pleas of feare: What if I ſtrike him? And yet who am I, that I ſhould dare to thinke of ſuch an act? Is not this Siſera, the famouſeſt captaine of the world, whoſe name hath wont to be fearefull to

whole Nations? What if my hand ſhould ſwarue in the ſtroke? What if hee ſhould awake, whiles I am lifting vp this inſtrument of death▪ What if I ſhould be ſurpriſed by ſome of his followers while the fact is greene, and yet bleeding? Can the murder of ſo great a Leader be hid, or vnreuenged? Or if I might hope ſo, yet can my heart allow mee to be ſecretly trecherous? Is there not peace betwixt my houſe, and him? Did not I inuite him to my Tent? Doth he not truſt to my friendſhip &amp; hoſpitalitie? But what doe theſe vveake feares, theſe idle fancies of ciuilitie? If Siſera be in league with vs, yet is he not at defiance with God? Is hee not a Tyrant to Iſrael? Is it for nothing that GOD hath

brought him into my Tent? May I not now finde meanes to repay vnto Iſrael all their kindneſſe to my Grand-father Iethro? Dooth not GOD offer mee this day, the honour to bee the Reſcuer of his people? Hath God bidden mee ſtrike, and ſhall I hold my hand? No Siſera, ſleepe now thy laſt, and take here this fatall reward of all thy cruelty and oppreſsion.
                     He that put this inſtinct into her hart, did put alſo ſtrength into her hand; He that guided Siſera to her Tent, guided the naile throgh his temples; which hath made a ſpeedie way for his ſoule throgh thoſe parts, and now hath faſtened his eare ſo cloſe to the earth, as if the body had been liſtening what was

becomne of the ſoule. There lyes now the great terror of Iſrael at the foote of a woman: Hee that brought ſo many hundred thouſands into the Field, hath not now one Page left, either to auert his death, or to accompany it, or bewaile it: Hee that had vaunted of his Iron chariots, is ſlaine by one naile of Iron, wanting onely this one point of his infelicity, that hee knowes not by whoſe hand he periſhed.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        Gideons Calling.
                     
                        THe iudgements of God ſtill the further they go, the ſorer they are; the bondage of Iſrael vnder Iabin was great, but it was freedome in compariſon of the yoke of the Midianites. During the former tyrannie, Deborah was permitted to Iudge Iſrael vnder a Palme-tree; Vnder this, not ſo much as priuate habitations will be allowed to Iſrael: Then, the ſeat of iudgement was in the ſight of the Sun, now their very dwellings muſt be ſecret, vnder the

earth. They that reiected the protection of God, are glad to ſeeke to the Mountaines for ſhelter; &amp; as they had ſauagely abuſed themſelues, ſo they are faine to creepe into dennes &amp; caues of the rocks, like wilde creatures for ſafegard: God had ſowen ſpirituall ſeed amongſt them, and they ſuffered their heatheniſh neighbors to pull it vp by the rootes; and now, no ſooner can they ſowe their materiall ſeed, but Midianites and Amalekites are ready by force to deſtroy it. As they inwardly dealt with God; ſo GOD deales outwardly by them; Their eyes may tell them what their ſoules haue done: yet that God whoſe mercie is aboue the worſt of our ſinnes ſends firſt his Prophet with a meſſage

of reproofe, and then his Angell with a meſſage of deliuerance. The Iſraelites had ſmarted enough with their ſeruitude, yet God ſends them a ſharp rebuke. It is a good ſigne when God chides vs, his round reprehenſions are euer gracious forerunners of mercie: wheras his ſilent conniuence at the wicked, argues deepe and ſecret diſpleaſure: The Prophet made way for the Angell, reproofe for deliuerance, humiliation for comfort.
                     
                        Gideon was threſhing Wheat by the Wine-preſſe. Yet Iſrael hath both Wheat and Wine, for all the incurſions of their enemies. The worſt eſtate out of hell, hath either ſome comfort, or at leaſt, ſome mitigation;

in ſpight of all the malice of the world, God makes ſecret prouiſion for his owne. How ſhould it be but he that ownes the earth, and all creatures, ſhould reſerue euer a ſufficiencie from forrainers (ſuch the wicked are) for his houſhold? In the worſt of the Midianitiſh tyranny, Gideons field and barne are priuiledged, as his fleece was afterwards from the ſhower.
                     Why did Gideon threſh out his corne? To hide it; Not from his neighbours, but his enemies: his Granary might eaſily bee more cloſe, then his barne. As then, Iſraelites threſhed out their corne, to hide it from the Midianites: but now, Midianites threſh out corne,

to hide it from the Iſraelites. Theſe rurall Tyrants of our time, do not more lay vp corne, then curſes; he that withdraweth corne, the people will curſe him; yea, God will curſe him, with them, &amp; for them.
                     What ſhifts nature will make to liue? Oh that we could be ſo carefull to lay vp ſpirituall foode for our ſoules, out of the reach of thoſe ſpirituall Midianites, vvee could not but liue, in deſpight of all Aduerſaries.
                     The Angels that haue euer God in their face, &amp; in their thoughts, haue him alſo in their mouthes, The Lord is with thee. But this which appeared vnto Gideon, was the Angel of the Couenaunt, the

Lord of Angels. Whiles hee was with Gideon, he might well ſay, The Lord is with thee. He that ſent the Comforter, vvas alſo the true Comforter of his Church; he wel knew, how to lay a ſure ground of Conſolation, and that the onelie remedy of ſorrow, and beginning of true ioy, is The preſence of GOD. The griefe of the Apoſtles for the expected loſſe of their Maſter, could neuer be cured by any receit but this, of the ſame Angel, Behold, I am with you to the end of the world. What is our glory but the fruition of Gods preſence? The puniſhment of the damned, is a ſeparation from the beatifical face of God; needs muſt therfore his abſence in this life, be a great torment to a good heart: and no

croſſe can bee equiualent to this beginning of heauen in the Elect, The Lord is with thee.
                     
                     Who can complaine either of ſolitarineſs, or oppoſition, that hath GOD with him? With him, not only as a witneſs, but as a partie: Euen wicked men and diuells cannot exclude God, not the bars of hell can ſhutte him out; Hee is with them perforce, but to iudge, to puniſh them: Yea, God will be euer with them to their coſt; but to protect, comfort, ſaue, hee is with none but his.
                     Whiles he calls Gideon valiant, he makes him ſo. How could hee be but valiant, that had God with him? The godleſs man may bee

careleſſe, but cannot be other then cowardly. It pleaſes God to acknowledge his owne graces in men, that he may interchange his owne glory, with their comfort; how much more ſhould wee confeſſe the graces of one another? An enuious nature is preiudiciall to God; Hee is a ſtrange man in whom there is not ſome viſible good; yea, in the Diuels themſelues wee may eaſily note ſome commendable parts, of knowledge, ſtrength, agilitie: Let God haue his owne in the worſt creature; yea, let the worſt creature haue that praiſe, which God wold put vpon it.
                     
                        Gideon cannot paſſe ouer this ſalutation, as ſom faſhionable complement,

but layes hold on that part, which was moſt important; the tenure of all his comfort; and (as not regarding the praiſe of his valour) inquires after that vvhich ſhould be the ground of his valour, the preſence of God: God had ſpoken particularly to him; He expoſtulates for all. It had bin poſsible GOD ſhould be preſent with him, not with the reſt; as hee promiſed to haue been with Moſes, Iſrael: and yet when God ſaies, The Lord is with thee, he anſwers, Alas Lord, if the Lord bee with vs. Gideon cannot conceiue of himſelfe as an exempt perſon; but puts himſelfe among the throng of Iſrael, as one that could not be ſenſible of any particular comfort, while the common caſe of Iſrael

laboured. The maine care of a good hart is ſtill for the publique, neither can it inioy it ſelfe, while the Church of God is diſtreſſed. As faith drawes home generalities, ſo charitie diffuſes generalities from it ſelfe to all.
                     Yet the valiant man was heere weake; weake in faith, weake in diſcourſe; whiles he argues Gods abſence by affliction, his preſence by deliuerances, and the vnlikelihood of ſucceſs by his own diſabilitie; all groſs inconſequences: Rather ſhould hee haue inferred Gods preſence vpon their correction; for whereſoeuer God chaſtiſes, there he is, yea, there hee is in mercy. Nothing more proues vs his, then his ſtripes; hee will not

beſtow whipping where he loues not. Fond nature thinks GOD ſhould not ſuffer the wind to blow vpon his deare ones, becauſe her ſelfe makes this vſe of her own indulgence; but none out of the place of torment, haue ſuffered ſo much as his deareſt children. Hee ſayes not we are Idolaters; therefore the Lord hath forſaken vs, becauſe wee haue forſaken him: This ſequell had been as good, as the other was faultie; (The Lord hath deliuered vs vnto the Midianites, therefore hee hath forſaken vs:) Sinnes, not afflctions, argue God abſent.
                     Whiles Gideon bewrayeth weaknes, God both giues him might and imployes it; (Goe in this thy

might, and ſaue Jſrael.) Who wold not haue looked that God ſhould haue looked angerly on him, and chid him for his vnbeliefe? But he whoſe mercy will not quench the weakeſt fire of grace, though it be but in flax, lookes vpon him with compaſsionate eyes; and to make good his owne word, giues him that valour hee had acknowledged.
                     
                        Gideon had not yet ſaid, Lord deliuer Jſrael: much leſſe had hee ſaid, Lord deliuer Iſrael by my hand. The mercy of God preuents the deſire of Gideon: if God ſhold not begin with vs, we ſhould be euer miſerable; if hee ſhould not giue vs till we aske, yet who ſhold giue vs to aske; if his ſpirit did not

worke thoſe holy grones, &amp; ſighes in vs, wee ſhould neuer make ſute to God. He that commonly giues vs power to craue, ſometimes giues vs without crauing, that the benefit might be ſo much more welcome, by how much leſs it was expected; and we ſo much more thankfull, as hee is more forward. When he bids vs aske, it is not for that he needes to be intreated; but that hee may make vs more capable of bleſsings, by deſiring them: And where hee ſees feruent deſires, he ſtayes not for words; and he that giues ere wee aske, how much more will hee giue when we aske.
                     Hee that hath might enough to deliuer Iſrael, yet hath not might

enough to keepe himſelfe from doubting. The ſtrongeſt faith will euer haue ſome touch of infidelitie. And yet this was not ſo much a diſtruſt of the poſsibility of deliuering Iſrael, as an inquiry after the meanes; Whereby ſhall I ſaue Iſrael? The ſalutation of the Angel to Gideon, was as like to Gabriels ſalutation of the bleſſed Virgin, as their anſweres were like: Both Angels brought newes of deliuerance; both were anſwered with a queſtion of the meanes of performance; with a report of the difficulties in performing: Ah my Lord, whereby ſhall I ſaue Iſrael? How the good man diſparages himſelfe! It is a great matter (O Lord) that thou ſpeakeſt of, and great actions require mightie Agents:

As for me, who am I? My Tribe is none of the greateſt in Iſrael; My Fathers family, is one of the meaneſt in his Tribe, and I the meaneſt in his family; Pouerty is a ſufficient bar to great enterpriſes.
                     
                        Whereby ſhall I? Humilitie is both a ſigne of following glory, &amp; a way to it, and an occaſion of it: Bragging and height of ſpirit, will not carry it, with GOD: None haue euer been raiſed by him, but thoſe which haue formerly deiected themſelues; None haue been confounded by him, that haue been abaſed in themſelues. Therevpon it is that he adds, I will therfore be with thee; as if hee had anſwered, Hadſt thou not beene ſo poore in thy ſelfe, I wold not haue

wrought by thee. How ſhold God be magnified in his mercies if wee were not vnworthy? How ſhould he be ſtrong, if not in our weakeneſſe?
                     All this while, Gideon knew not it was an Angel that ſpake vvith him; Hee ſaw a man ſtand before him like a Trauailer, with a ſtaffe in his hand. The vnuſualneſs of thoſe reuelations in thoſe corrupted times was ſuch, that Gideon might thinke of any thing rather then an Angell: No maruell if ſo ſtrange a promiſe from an vnknowne meſſenger, found not a perfect aſſent; Faine would he belieue, but faine would hee haue good warrant for his faith. In matters of faith we cannot goe vpon

too ſure grounds. As Moſes therefore being ſent vpon the ſame errand, deſired a ſigne, whereby Iſrael might knowe that God ſent him: So Gideon deſires a ſigne from this Bearer▪ to know that his newes is from God.
                     Yet the very hope of ſo happy newes, not yet ratified, ſtirres vp in Gideon both ioy and thankfulneſs. After all the iniury of the Midianites, he was not ſo poore, but he could beſtowe a Kid, and cakes, vpon the Reporter of ſuch tidings. Thoſe which are rightly affected with the glad newes of our ſpirituall deliuerance, ſtudy to ſhow their louing reſpects to the meſſengers.
                     
                        
The Angel ſtayes for the preparing of Gideons feaſt. Such pleaſure dooth GOD take in the thankfull indeauours of his ſeruants, that he patiently waites vpon the leyſure of our performances. Gideon intended a dinner, the Angel turned it into a ſacrifice. He whoſe meat and drinke it was to doe his Fathers will, calls for the broth and fleſh to be poured out vpon the ſtone; And when Gideon lookt hee ſhould haue bleſſed, and eaten, hee touches the feaſt with his ſtaffe, and conſumes it with fire from the ſtone, and departed. He did not ſtrike the ſtone with his ſtaffe (For the attrition of two hard bodies would naturally beget fire) but hee touched the meat, and brought fire from the

ſtone: And now whiles Gideon ſaw and wondred at the ſpirituall act, he loſt the ſight of the Agent.
                     Hee that came vvithout intreating, vvould not haue departed without taking leaue, but that hee might increaſe Gideons vvonder, and that his wonder might increaſe his faith. His ſalutation therefore was not ſo ſtrange as his farewell. Moſes touched the rock with his ſtaffe, and brought forth vvater, and yet a man, and yet continued vvith the Iſraelites. This meſſenger touches the ſtone vvith his ſtaffe, and brings foorth fire, &amp; preſently vaniſhes, that he may approue himſelfe a ſpirit. And now Gideon, when he had gathered vp himſelfe, muſt needes thinke,

Hee that can raiſe fire out of a ſtone, can raiſe courage and power out of my dead breaſt; He that by this fire hath conſumed the broth and fleſh, can by the feeble flame of my fortitude conſume Midian.
                     
                     
                        Gideon did not ſo much doubt before, as now he feared. We that ſhall once liue with, and bee like the Angels, in the eſtate of our impotencie thinke we cannot ſee an Angel, and liue. Gideon was acknowledged for mighty in valour, yet he trembles at the ſight of an Angel. Peter, that durſt draw his ſword vpon Malchus, and all the traine of Iudas, yet feares when he thought he had ſeene a ſpirit. Our naturall courage cannot be are vs

out againſt ſpirituall obiects. This Angel was homely &amp; familiar, taking vpon him for the time, a reſemblance of that fleſh wherof he would afterwards take the ſubſtance; yet euen the valiant Gideon quakes to haue ſeen him: How awfull and glorious is the God of Angels, when he will be ſeen in the ſtate of heauen!
                     The Angel that departed for the wonder, yet returnes for the comfort of Gideon; It is not the wont of God to leaue his children in a maze, but hee brings them out in the ſame mercy which led them in, and will magnifie his grace in the one, no leſſe then his power in the other.
                     
                        
Now Gideon growes acquainted with God, and interchanges pledges of familiarity; He buildes an Altar to God, and God conferres with him; and (as he vſes where he loues) imployes him. His firſt task muſt be to deſtroy the god of the Midianites, then the Idolaters thē
                        ſelues. Whiles Baals Altar &amp; groue ſtood in the hill of Ophrah, Iſrael ſhould in vaine hope to preuaile: It is moſt iuſt with God that iudgment ſhould continue with the ſin, and no leſs mercy, if it may remoue after it. Woldſt thou fain be rid of any iudgment? Inquire what falſe Altars &amp; groues thou haſt in thy heart; down with them firſt.
                     Firſt muſt Baals Altar be ruined ere Gods be built, both may not

ſtand together; The true GOD will haue no ſocietie with Idols, neither will allow it vs. I doe not heare him ſay, That Altar &amp; groue which were abuſed to Baal, conſecrate now to me; but as one whoſe holy ielouſie wil abide no worſhip till there be no idolatry, hee firſt commands down the monuments of ſuperſtition, and then inioynes his owne ſeruice; yet the wood of Baals groue muſt be vſed to burne a ſacrifice vnto God: When it was once cut down, Gods deteſtation, &amp; their danger ceaſed. The good creatures of God that haue beene profaned to Idolatry, may in a change of their vſe, bee imployed to the holie ſeruice of their Maker.
                     
                        
Though ſome Iſraelites vvere penitent vnder this humiliation, yet ſtill many of them perſiſted in their wonted Idolatry. The very houſhold of Gideons father were ſtill Baalites, and his neighbours of Ophrah were in the ſame ſin: yea if his father had been free, what did he with Baals groue and Altar? He dares not therfore take his fathers ſeruants, thogh he tooke his bullocks, but commaunds his owne. The Maſter is beſt ſeene in the ſeruants: Gideons ſeruants (amongſt the Idolatrous retinue of Ioaſh) are religious, like their Maſter; yet the miſ-deuotion of Ioaſh, and the Ophrathites was not obſtinate. Ioaſh is eaſily perſwaded by his ſonne, and eaſily perſwades his neighbours, how vnreaſonable it

is to plead for ſuch a god, as cannot ſpeak for himſelfe; to reuenge his cauſe, that could not defend himſelfe. Let Baal plead for himſelfe. One example of a reſolute onſet in a noted perſon, may doe more good then a thouſand ſeconds in the proceeding of an action.
                     Soone are all the Midianites in an vprore to loſe their god; They need not now be bidden to muſter themſelues for reuenge: hee hath no religion that can ſuffer an indignitie offered to his God.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        Gideons Preparation and Victorie.
                     
                     
                        OF all the inſtruments that GOD vſed in ſo great a worke, I finde none ſo weake as Gideon; who yet (of all others) was ſtiled valiant: naturall valour may well ſtand with ſpirituall cowardiſe. Before he knew that he ſpake with a God, he might haue iuſt colours for his diſtruſt; but after God had approoued his preſence, and almighty power, by fetching fire out of the ſtone, then to call for a watery ſigne of his promiſed

deliuerance, was no other then to poure water vpon the fire of the ſpirit. The former triall God gaue vnwiſhed; this, vpon Gideons choice and intreatie: The former miracle was ſtrong enough to cary Gideon through his firſt exploit of ruinating the idolatrous groue, and Altar; but now, when he ſaw the ſwarme of the Midianites and Amalekites about his eares, he calls for new ayde; and not truſting to his Abiezrites, and his other thouſands of Iſrael, hee runnes to God for a further aſſurance of victorie.
                     The refuge was good, but the manner of ſeeking it, ſauours of diſtruſt. There is nothing more eaſie then to be valiant, when no perill appeareth; but when euills

aſſaile vs vpon vnequall tearms, it is hard, and commendable Not to be diſmaied. If GOD had made that proclamation now, which afterwards was commaunded to be made by Gideon, Let the timorous depart, I doubt whether Iſrael had not wanted a Guide: yet how willing is the Almighty to ſatisfie our weak deſires!
                     What tasks is he content to bee ſet by our infirmitie? The fleece muſt be wet, and the ground dry; the ground muſt be wet, and the fleece dry: Both are done; that now Gideon may ſee whether hee would make himſelfe hard earth, or yeelding vvoll. God could at pleaſure diſtinguiſh betwixt him, and the Midianites, &amp; poure down

either mercies or iudgement where he liſts, and that hee was ſet on worke by that God, which can commaund all the Elements, and they obey him; Fire, Water, Earth, ſerue both him, and (when he will) his.
                     And now when Gideon had this reciprocall proofe of his inſuing ſucceſſe, he goes on (as hee vvell may) harneſſed with reſolution, and is ſeene in the Head of his troupes, and in the face of the Midianites. If we cannot make vp the match with God, when wee haue our owne asking, wee are worthie to ſit out.
                     
                        Gideon had but thirty thouſand ſouldiers at his his heeles; the Midianites
                        
couered all the vally, like Graſhoppers: and now whiles the Iſraelites thinke, We are too few; God ſayes, The people are too many. If the Iſraelites muſt haue looked for victory from their fingers, they might well haue ſaid, The Midianites are too many for vs; but that God, whoſe thoughts and words are vnlike to mens, ſayes, They are too many for mee to giue the Midianites into their hands. If humane ſtrength were to be oppoſed, there ſhould haue needed an equalitie; but now God meant to giue the victory, his care is not how to get it, but how not to loſe or blemiſh the glory of it gotten. How ielous God is of his honour! Hee is willing to giue deliuerance to Iſrael, but the praiſe of the deliuerance

he will keepe to himſelfe; and will ſhorten the meanes, that hee may haue the full meaſure of the glory. And if hee will not allow lawfull meanes to ſtand in the light of his honour, how will hee indure it to be croſſed ſo much as indirectly? It is leſs danger to ſteale any thing from God, then his glory.
                     As a Prince, which if wee ſteale or clip his coyne, may pardon it; but if we goe about to rob him of his crowne, will not be appeaſed. There is nothing that we can giue to God, of whom wee receiue all things; that which he is content to part with, he giues vs; but he will not abide wee ſhould take ought from him, which he would reſerue for himſelfe. It is all one with him

to ſaue with many, and with fewe, but hee rather choſes to ſaue by fewe, that all the victory may redound to himſelfe. O God, what art thou the better for our praiſes, to whom becauſe thou art infinite nothing can be added? It is for our good that thou wouldſt be magnified of vs; Oh teach vs to receiue the benefit of thy mercifull fauours, and to returne thee the thanks.
                     
                        Gideons Army muſt be leſſened; Who are ſo fitte to be caſhered as the fearefull? God bids him therefore proclaime licence for all faint harts to leaue the field. An ill inſtrument may ſhame a good work: God will not glorifie himſelfe by cowards. As the timorous ſhall be

without the gates of heauen; ſo ſhall they be without the liſts of of Gods field. Although it vvas not their courage that ſhould ſaue Iſrael, yet without their courage God would not ſerue himſelfe of them. Chriſtianity requires men; for if our ſpiritual difficulties meet not with high ſpirits, in ſteed of whetting our fortitude, they quaile it. Dauids royall Band of Woorthies, was the type of the forces of the Church; all valiant men, and able to incounter with thouſands.
                     Neither muſt we be ſtrong onely, but acquainted with our owne reſolutions; not out of any carnal preſumption, but out of a faithfull reliance vpō the ſtrength of God; in whom, when we are weak, then

we are ſtrong. Oh thou white liuer! doth but a foule word, or a frowne ſcarre thee from Chriſt? Dooth the loſſe of a little land, or ſiluer diſquiet the? Doth but the ſight of the Midianites in the vally ſtrike thee? Home then, home to the world; thou art not then for the conquering Band of Chriſt: If thou canſt not reſolue to follow him throgh infamie, priſons, racks, 
                           •
                        ibbets, flames; Depart to thine houſe, &amp; ſaue thy life to thy loſſe.
                     Mee thinks now, Iſrael ſhould haue complained of indignity, &amp; haue ſaid, VVhy ſhouldſt thou thinke, O Gideon, that there can be a cowardly Iſraelite? And if the experience of the power and mercy of God, be not enough to

make vs feare leſs, yet the ſenſe of ſeruitude muſt needes haue made vs reſolute; for who had not rather to be buried dead, thē quick? Are we not faine to hide our heads in the caues of the earth, and to make our graues our houſes? Not ſo much as the very light that wee can freely inioy; the tyrannie of death is but ſhort and eaſie, to this of Midian: and yet what danger can there be of that, fith thou haſt ſo certainly aſſured vs of Gods promiſe of victory, and his miraculous confirmation? No, Gideon, thoſe harts that haue brought vs hither after thy Colours, can as well keepe vs from retyring.
                     But now, vvho can but bleſſe himſelfe, to finde of two &amp; thirtie

thouſand Iſraelites, two &amp; twenty thouſand cowards? Yet all theſe in Gideons march made as faire a flouriſh of courage as the boldeſt. VVho can truſt the faces of men, that ſees in the Army of Iſrael, aboue two for one timorous? How many make a glorious ſhow in the warfaring Church, vvhich when they ſhall ſee danger of perſecution, ſhall ſhrinke from the ſtandard of God? Hope of ſafety, examples of neighbours, deſire of prayſe, fear of cenſures, coaction of lawes, fellowſhip of friends, draw many into the field; which ſo ſoone as euer they ſee the Aduerſary, repent of their conditions: and if they may cleanly eſcape, will be gone early from Mount Gilead. Can any man be offended at the

number of theſe ſhrinkers, when he ſees but tenne thouſand Iſraelites left of two and twenty thouſand in one morning.
                     Theſe men that would haue bin aſhamed to go away by day, now drop away by night; And if Gideon ſhould haue called any one of them backe, and ſaid, Wilt thou flee? would haue made an excuſe. The darkneſs is a fit vaile for their paleneſſe, or bluſhing; fearfulneſs cannot abide the light: None of theſe thouſands of Iſrael but wold haue bin loath Gideon ſhould haue ſeen his face whiles hee ſaid, I am fearefull; very ſhame holds ſome in their ſtation, whoſe hearts are already fled. And if we cannot indure that men ſhould be witneſſes

of that fear which we might liue to correct, how ſhall wee abide once to ſhow our fearefull heads, before that terrible Iudge, when hee calls vs foorth to the puniſhment of our feare? Oh the vanitie of fooliſh hypocrites, that run vpon the terrors of GOD, whiles they would auoyde the ſhame of men?
                     How doe wee thinke the ſmall remainder of Iſrael looked, when in the next morning-muſter they found themſelues but tenne thouſand left? How did they accuſe their timorous Countrymen, that had left but this handfull to encounter the millions of Midian? And yet ſtill, God complaines of too many; and vpon his triall, diſmiſſes nine thouſand ſeauen hundred

more. His firſt triall was of the valour of their minds: his next is of the ability of their bodies; Thoſe which beſides boldnes are not ſtrong, patient of labour and thirſt, willing to ſtoope, content with a little (ſuch were thoſe that took vp water with their hand) are not for the ſelect Band of GOD. The Lord of Hoſts will ſerue himſelfe of none but able Champions; If he haue therefore ſingled vs into his combat, this very choice argues, that hee findes that ſtrength in vs, which we cannot confeſſe in our ſelues. How can it but comfort vs in our great trialls, that if the ſearcher of hearts did not find vs fit, hee would neuer honour vs with ſo hard an imployment?
                     
                        
Now, when there is not ſcarce left one Iſraelite to euery thouſand of the Midianites, it is ſeaſonable with God to ioyne battell. When God hath ſtripped vs of all our earthly confidence, then doth hee finde time to giue vs victory; and not till then, leaſt he ſhould be a loſer in our gaine: Like as at laſt he vnclothes vs of our body, that he may clothe vs vpon with glory.
                     
                        If Gideon feared when he had two and thirty thouſand Iſraelites at his heeles, is it any wonder if hee feared, when all theſe were ſhrunke into three hundred? Though his confirmation were more, yet his meanes were abated. Why vvas not Gideon rather the Leader of thoſe two and twenty thouſand

runne-awaies, then of theſe three hundred ſouldiers? Oh infinite mercie, and forbearance of God, that takes not vantage of ſo ſtrong an infirmitie, but in ſtead of caſting, incourages him. That wiſe Prouidēce hath prepared a dream in the head of one Midianite, an interpretation in the mouth of another, and hath brought Gideon to bee an auditor of both; and hath made his enemies Prophets of his victory, incouragers of the attempt, proclaimers of their owne confuſion. A Midianite dreames, a Midianite interprets. Our verie dreames many times are not without God; there is a prouidence in our ſleeping fancies: euen the emies of God may haue viſions, &amp; power to conſtrue them aright;

How vſually are wicked men forwarned of their owne deſtruction? To foreknow &amp; not auoyd, is but an aggrauation of iudgement.
                     When Gideon heard good newes (tho from an enemy) he fel down and worſhipped. To heare, himſelfe but a Barly-cake, troubled him not, when hee heard withall, that his roling down the hill ſhold breake the Tents of Midian; It matters not how baſe wee bee thought, ſo we may be victorious. The ſoule that hath receiued full confirmation from God, in the aſſurance of his ſaluation, cannot but bow the knee, and by all geſtures of bodie, tell how it is rauiſhed.
                     
                        
I vvould haue thought Gideon ſhould rather haue found full confirmation in the promiſe, and act of GOD, then in the dreame of the Midianite. Dreames may be full of vncertainty; Gods vndertakings are infallible: well therefore might the miracle of GOD giue ſtrength to the dreame of a Midianite; but what ſtrength could a Pagans dreame giue to the miraculous act of God? yet by this is Gideon throughly ſettled. When wee are going, a little thing driues vs on; when we are come neere to the ſhore, the very tide vvithout ſailes, is enough to put vs into the harbour. We ſhall now heare no more of Gideons doubts, but of his atchieuements: And though God had promiſed by theſe three hundred

to chaſe the Midianites, yet he neglects not wiſe ſtratagems to effect it. To wait for Gods performance in doing nothing, is to abuſe that diuine Prouidence, which will ſo worke, that it vvill not allow vs idle.
                     Now, when wee would looke that Gideon ſhould giue charge of whetting their ſwords, &amp; ſharpening their ſpeares, and fitting their Armour, he onely giues order for empty pitchers, and lights, and trumpets. The cracking of theſe pitchers ſhall breake in peeces this Midianitiſh clay: the kindling of theſe lights, ſhall extinguiſh the light of Midian: theſe trumpets, ſound no other then a ſoule-peale to all the hoſt of Midian: there ſhal

need nothing but noiſe &amp; light to confound this innumerable Armie.
                     And if the pitchers, and brands, and trumpets of Gideon, did ſo daunt &amp; diſmay the proud troopes of Midian, &amp; Amalecke, Who can we think ſhall be able to ſtand before the laſt terror, vvherein the trumpet of the Archangell ſhall ſound, and the heauens ſhall paſſe away with a noiſe, &amp; the elements ſhal be on a flame about our eares?
                     Any of the vveakeſt Iſraelites would haue ſerued to haue broken an empty pitcher, to haue carried a light, &amp; to haue ſounded a trumpet, and to ſtrike a flying aduerſarie. Not to the baſeſt vſe will God

employ an vnworthy Agent; Hee will not allow ſo much as a cowardly torch-bearer.
                     Thoſe two and twenty thouſand Iſraelites that ſlipt away for feare, when the feareful Midianites fled, can purſue, and kill them, &amp; can follovv them at the heeles, whom they durſt not looke in the face. Our flight giues aduantage to the feebleſt aduerſary, whereas our reſiſtance foileth the greateſt: How much more, if we haue once turned our backs vpon a tentation, ſhall our ſpirituall enemies (which are euer ſtrong) trample vs in the duſt? Reſiſt, and they ſhal flee: ſtand ſtill, and we ſhall ſee the ſaluation of the Lord.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                     The Reuenge of Succoth and Penuell.
                     
                        
                           GIdeon was of Manaſseh: Ephraim and hee vvere brothers, ſonnes of Ioſeph; None of all the Tribes of Jſrael fall out with their victorious Leader, but he: The agreement of brothers is rare; by how much nature hath more endeared them, by ſo much are their quarrels more frequent and dangerous. I did not heare the Ephraimites offring themſelues into the front of the Army, before the

fight, and now they are readie to fight with Gideon, becauſe they were not called to fight with Midian: I heare them expoſtulating after it; After the exploit done, cowards are valiant. Their quarrell was that they were not called; It had bin a greater praiſe of their valour to haue gone vnbidden: What need was there to call them, when God complained of multitude, and ſent away thoſe which were called? None ſpeake ſo bigge in the end of the fray, as the fearefulleſt.
                     
                        Ephraim flies vpon Gideon, vvhiles the Midianites flie from him; when Gideon ſhould be purſuing his enemies, he is purſued by brethren; &amp; now is glad to ſpend

that wind in pacifying of his own, which ſhould haue been beſtowed in the ſlaughter of a common Aduerſary: It is a wonder if Satan ſuffer vs to be quiet at home, whiles wee are exerciſed with warres abroad. Had not Gideon Iearned to ſpeake faire, as well as to ſmite, he had found work enough from the ſwords of Ioſephs ſonnes; his good wordes are as victorious as his ſword; his pacification of friends, better then his execution of enemies.
                     For ought I ſee, the enuy of Iſraelites was more troubleſome to Gideon, then the oppoſition of Midian; He hath left the enuy of Ephraim behind him: before him, he findes the enuy of Succoth and Penuell.
                        
The one, enuies that hee ſhould ouer-come without them; the other, that hee ſhould but ſay hee had ouer-come. His purſute leades him to Succoth, there hee craues releefe, &amp; is repelled. Had he ſaid, Come forth &amp; draw your ſword with mee againſt Zeba and Zalmunna, the motion had beene but equall; A common intereſt challenges an vniuerſall ayde: Now he ſaies, but, Giue morſells of bread to my followers; He is turn'd off with a ſcorne; Hee asks bread, and they giue him a ſtone. Could hee aske a more ſlender recompence of their deliuerance, or a leſſe reward of his victory? Giue morſels of bread. Before this act, all their ſubſtance had been too ſmall an hire of their freedome

from Midian; now when it is done, a morſell of bread is too much: Well might hee challenge bread, where he gaue liberty, and life. It is hard, if thoſe which fight the warres of God, may not haue neceſſary reliefe; that whiles the enemy dies by them, they ſhould die by famine. If they had laboured for GOD at home in peace, they had been worthy of maintenance; how much more now, that danger is added to their toyle? Euen very Executioners looke for fees: but heere were not malefactors, but aduerſaries to be ſlaine; the ſword of power and reuenge was now to bee wielded, not of quiet iuſtice. Thoſe that fight for our ſoules againſt ſpirituall powers, may challenge bread from vs,

and it is a ſhameleſſe vnthankfulneſſe to deny it. When Abraham had vanquiſhed the fiue Kings, &amp; deliuered Lot and his familie, the King of Salem met him with bread and wine; and now theſe ſonnes of Abram, after an equall victorie, aske dry bread, and are denied by their brethren: Craftily yet, &amp; vnder pretence of a falſe title, had they acknowledged the victory of Gideon, with what forhead could they haue denied him bread?
                     Now, I knowe not vvhether their faithleſneſſe, or enuy lie in their way; Are the hands of Zeba and Zalmunna in thy hands? There vvere none of theſe Princes of Succoth and Penuel, but thought thēſelues better men then Gideon;
                        
That hee therefore alone, ſhould doe that, which all the Princes of Iſrael durſt not attempt, they hated and ſcorned to heare. It is neuer ſafe to meaſure euents by the power of the inſtrument; nor in the cauſes of God (whoſe calling makes the difference) to meaſure others by our ſelues: There is nothing more dangerous then in holy buſineſſes to ſtand vpon compariſons, and our own reputation; ſith it is reaſon GOD ſhould both chuſe, and bleſſe where he liſts.
                     To haue queſtioned ſo ſudden a victory had bin pardonable: but to deny it ſcornfully, was vnworthy of Iſraelites. Carnall men think that impoſsible to others, vvhich themſelues cannot doe: From

hence are their cenſures, hence their exclamations.
                     
                        Gideon hath vowed a fearfull reuenge, and now performes it; the taunts of his brethren may not ſtay him from the purſute of the Midianites; Common enmities muſt firſt be oppoſed, domeſticall, at more leyſure. The Princes of Succoth feared the tyranny of the Midianitiſh Kings, but they more feared Gideons victory. What a condition hath their enuy drawn them into? that they are ſory to ſee Gods enemies captiue; that Iſraels freedome muſt bee their death; that the Midianites &amp; they, muſt tremble at one and the ſame Reuenger. To ſee themſelues priſoners to Zeba and Zalmunna, had not

been ſo fearefull, as to ſee Zeba &amp; Zalmunna priſoners to Gideon. Nothing is more terrible to euill mindes, then to read their owne condemnation in the happy ſucceſſe of others: Hell it ſelfe would want one peece of his torment, if the wicked did not knowe thoſe whom they contemned, glorious.
                     I knowe not whether more to commend Gideons wiſedome and moderation in the proceedings, then his reſolution and iuſtice in the execution of this buſineſs. I doe not ſee him runne furiouſlie into the Citie, and kill the next; His ſword had not been ſo drunken with bloud, that it ſhold know no difference: But he writes down

the names of the Princes, and ſingles them forth for reuenge.
                     When the Leaders of GOD come to a Iericho, or Ai, their ſlaughter was vnpartiall; not a woman or child might liue to tell newes: but now that Gideon comes to a Succoth, a Citie of Iſraelites, the Rulers are called foorth to death, the people are frighted with the example, not hurt vvith the iudgement. To enwrappe the innocent in any vengeance, is a murderous iniuſtice: Indeede where all ioyne in the ſin, all are woorthy to meet in the puniſhment. It is like, the Citizens of Succoth could haue been glad to ſuccour Gideon, if their Rulers had not forbidden: they muſt therefore

eſcape, vvhiles their Princes periſh.
                     I cannot thinke of Gideons reuenge without horror; That the Rulers of Succoth ſhold haue their fleſh torne from their backs with thornes &amp; briers; that they ſhould be at once beaten, and ſcratcht to death. What a ſpectacle it was to ſee their bare bones looking ſome-where through the bloudie ragges of their fleſh and skinne, and euery ſtroke worſe then the laſt; death multiplied by torment! Iuſtice is ſometimes ſo ſeuere, that a tender beholder can ſcarce diſcerne it from crueltie.
                     I ſee the Midianites fare leſſe ill; the edge of the ſword makes a

ſpeedie and eaſie paſſage for their liues, whiles theſe rebellious Iſraelites die lingringly vnder thornes and bryers, enuying thoſe in their death, whom their life abhorred. Howſoeuer men liue or die without the pale of the Church, a wicked Iſraelite ſhalbe ſure of plagues. How many ſhal vnwiſh themſelues Chriſtians, when Gods reuenges haue found them out? The place where Iacob wreſtled with GOD Peni-el. and preuailed, now hath wreſtled againſt God, and takes a fall; they ſee God auenging which would not belieue him deliuering.
                     It was now time for Zeba &amp; Zalmunna to follow thoſe their troups to the graue, whom they had led in the field: Thoſe which the day

before, were attended with an hundred thirty fiue thouſand followers, haue not ſo much as a Page now left to weepe for their death; and haue liued onely to ſee all their friends, and ſome enemies, die for their ſakes. Who can regard earthly greatneſs, that ſees one night change two of the greateſt Kings of the world into captiues? It had been both pitie and ſinne, that the heads of that Midianitiſh tyranny, into which they had drawne ſo many thouſands, ſhould haue eſcaped that death.
                     And yet, if priuate reuenge had not made Gideon iuſt, I doubt whether they had died; The bloud of his brothers calls for theirs, and awakes his ſword to their execution;

Hee both knew and complained of the Madianitiſh oppreſsion, vnder which Iſrael groned: yet the cruelty offered to all the thouſands of his Fathers ſonnes, had not drawne the bloud of Zeba and Zalmunna, if his own mothers ſons had not bled by their hands. Hee that ſlew the Rulers of Succoth and Penuel, &amp; ſpared the people, now hath ſlaine the people of Midian, and would haue ſpared their Rulers: but that God which wil finde occaſions to wind wicked men into iudgement, wil haue them ſlain in a priuate quarrell, which had more deſerued it for the publike; If we may not rather ſay, that Gideon reuenged theſe as a Magiſtrate, not as a brother: For Gouernors to reſpect their own ends

in publique actions, and to weare the ſword of iuſtice in their owne ſheath, it is a wrongfull abuſe of authoritie. The ſlaughter of Gideons brethren, was not the greateſt ſinne of the Midianitiſh Kings; this alone ſhall kill them, vvhen the reſt expected an vniuſt remiſſion. How many lewd men hath God paid with ſome one ſinne for all the reſt? Some that haue gone away with vnnaturall filthineſſe, &amp; capitall thefts, haue clipped off their own dayes with their coine; Others, whoſe bloudy murders haue been puniſhed in a mutinous word; Others, whoſe ſuſpected felony hath payd the price of their vnknowne rape. O GOD, thy iudgements are iuſt, euen vvhen mens are vniuſt!
                     
                        
                        Gideons young ſon is bidden to reuenge the death of his Vncles; His ſword had not yet learn'd the way to bloud, eſpecially of Kings, though in irons: Deadly executions require ſtrength both of heart and face. How are thoſe aged in euill, that can draw their ſwords vpon the lawfully Anointed of God? Theſe Tyrants pleade not now for continuance of life, but for the haſte of their death; Fall thou vpon vs. Death is euer accompanied with paine, which it is no maruell if we wiſh ſhort: Wee doe not more affect protraction of an eaſefull life, then ſpeed in our diſſolution; for heere euery pang that tends toward death, renewes it: To lie an houre vnder death, is tedious; but to be dying a whole

day, we thinke aboue the ſtrength of humane patience. Oh what ſhal wee then conceiue of that death, which knowes no end? As this life is no leſſe fraile then the bodie which it animates; ſo that death is no leſſe eternall then the ſoule which muſt endure it: For vs to be dying ſo long as wee now haue leaue to hue, is intolerable; and yet one onely minute of that other tormenting death, is worſe then an age of this. Oh the deſperate infidelitie of careleſſe men, that ſhrinke at the thought of a momentany death, and feare not eternal. This is but a killing of the body: that is a deſtruction of body and ſoule.
                     
                        
Who is ſo worthy to weare the Crowne of Iſrael, as hee that won the Crowne from Midian. Their Vſurpers were gone, now they are headleſs; It is a doubt whether they were better to haue had no Kings, or Tyrants; They ſue to Gideon to accept of the Kingdom, &amp; are repulſed; There is no greater example of modeſtie, then Gideon. When the Angel ſpake to him, he abaſed himſelfe belowe all Iſrael; when the Ephraimites contended with him, hee prefers their gleanings to his vintage, and caſts his honour at their feet: and now when Iſrael profers him that kingdome which he had merited, hee refuſes it. Hee that in ouercomming would allow them to cry, The ſword of the Lord, and of Gideon,
                        
in gouerning, will haue none but The ſword of the Lord. That which others plotte, and ſue, and ſweare, and bribe for, Dignity and ſuperiority, hee ſeriouſly reiects; vvhether it were, for that he knew God had not yet called them to a Monarchy; or rather, for that hee ſaw the Crowne among thornes? What doe wee ambitiouſly affect the commaund of theſe mole-hils of earth, when wiſe men haue refuſed the profers of Kingdomes? Why doe we not rather labor for that Kingdome which is free from all cares, from all vncertaintie?
                     Yet he that refuſes their Crown, calls for their earings, although not to enrich himſelfe, but religion. So long had God bin a ſtranger

to Iſrael, that now ſuperſtition goes currant for deuout worſhip. It were pitty that good intentions ſhold make any man wicked; here they did ſo: Neuer man meant better then Gideon in his rich Ephod; yet this very act ſet all Iſrael on whoring: God had choſen a place, and a ſeruice of his owne. When the wit of man will be ouerpleaſing God with better deuiſes then his owne, it turnes to madneſs, and ends in miſchiefe.
                  
                  
                     
                     Abimelechs Ʋſurpation.
                     
                        
                           GIdeon refuſed the kingdome of Iſrael when it was offred; his ſeuenty ſonnes offred not to obtaine that Scepter, which their fathers victorie had deſerued to make hereditary: onely Abimelec the concubines ſonne, ſues and ambitiouſly plots for it. VVhat could Abimelec ſee in himſelfe that hee ſhould ouer-looke all his brethren? If hee lookt to his father, they were his equals; if to his mother, they were his betters. Thoſe

that are moſt vnworthy of honor, are horeſt in the chaſe of it, whiles the conſcience of better deſerts bids men ſitte ſtill, and ſtay to be either importuned, or neglected; There can be no greater ſigne of vnfitneſs, then vehement ſute: It is hard to ſay, whether there be more pride, or ignorance in Ambition. I haue noted this difference betwixt ſpirituall and earthly honor, and the Clients of both; wee cannot be worthy of the one without earneſt proſecution; nor with earneſt proſecution worthy of the other: The violent obtain heauen; onely the meek are worthy to inherit the earth.
                     That which an aſpiring heart hath proiected, it will finde both

argument and means to effect; If either bribes or fauour will carry it, the proud man will not ſit out; The Shechemites are fit brokers for Abimelec; That Citie which once betrayed it ſelfe to vtter depopulation in yeelding to the ſute of Hamor, now betraies it ſelfe, and all Iſrael in yielding to the requeſt of Abimelec; By them hath this Vſurper made himſelfe a faire way to the throne: It was an eaſie queſtion, Whether will ye admitte of the ſonnes of Gideon for your Rulers, or of Strangers? If of the ſons of Gideon, whether of all, or one? If of one, whether of your owne fleſh and bloud, or of others vnknown? To caſt off the ſonnes of Gideon for Strangers, were vnthankfull; To admit of ſeauentie

Kings in one ſmall Country, were vnreaſonable; To admit of any other rather then their owne kinſman, were vnnaturall. Gideons ſons therefore muſt rule amongſt all Iſrael; One of his ſonnes amongſt thoſe ſeuentie: and who ſhould be that one but Abimelec? Natural reſpects are the moſt dangerous corrupters of all elections; What hope can there bee of worthy Superiors in any free people, where neereneſs of bloud carries it from fitnes of diſpoſition? Whiles they ſay, He is our brother, they are enemies to themſelues, and Iſrael.
                     Faire words haue won his brethren; they the Sechemites; the Sechemites furniſh him with mony, mony with men; His men begin

with murder, and now Abimelec raignes alone; Flattery, bribes and bloud, are the vſuall ſtayres of the Ambitious: The mony of Baal is a fit hire for murderers; that which Idolatry hath gathered, is fitlie ſpent vpon Treaſon: One diuel is ready to help another in miſchief; Seldome euer is ill-gotten riches better imployed. It is no wonder if he that hath Baal his Idol, now make an Idol of Honour. There was neuer any man that worſhipped but one Idol; Wo be to them that lie in the way of the Aſpiring: Tho they be brothers, they ſhall bleed; yea the nearer they are, the more ſure is their ruine. VVho would not now thinke that Abimelec ſhould finde an hell in his breaſt, after ſo barbarous and vnnaturall

a maſſacre; and yet behold he is as ſenſeleſſe as the ſtone vpon which the bloud of his ſeauenty brethren was ſpilt. VVhere Ambition hath poſſeſt it ſelfe throughly of the ſoule, it turnes the heart into ſteele, and makes it vncapable of a conſcience; All ſinnes will eaſily downe vvith the man that is reſolued to riſe.
                     Onely Iotham fell not at that fatall ſtone with his brethren; It is an hard battell where none eſcapes. Hee eſcapes, not to raigne, not to reuenge; but to be a Prophet, and a witneſſe of the vengeance of GOD vpon the Vſurper, vpon the Abettors; Hee liues to tell Abimelec hee was but a bramble, a weed rather then a tree. A

right bramble indeed, that grew but out of the baſe hedg-row of a Concubine, that could not lift vp his head from the earth, vnleſſe he were ſupported by ſome buſh or pale of Shechem, that had laid hold of the fleece of Iſrael, and had drawne bloud of all his brethren; and laſtly, that had no ſubſtance in him, but the ſap of vaine-glory, and the pricks of crueltie. It vvas better then a kingdom to him, out of his obſcure Beer, to ſee the fire out of this bramble to conſume thoſe trees; The view of Gods reuenge, is ſo much more pleaſing to a good heart, then his owne, by how much it is more iuſt and full.
                     There was neuer ſuch a patterne of vnthankfulneſs, as theſe Iſraelites:

They which lately thought a Kingdome too ſmall recompence for Gideon and his ſonnes, novv thinke it too much for his ſeede to liue; and take life away from the ſonnes of him, that gaue thē both life and liberty. Yet if this had bin ſome hundred of yeers after, when time had worne out the memory of Ierub-baal, it might haue borne a better excuſe. No man can hope to hold paſe with Time; The beſt names may not think ſcorne to be vnknowne to following generations: but ere their Deliuerer vvas cold in his coffin, to pay his benefits (which deſerued to be euerlaſting) with the extirpation of his Poſteritie, it was more then ſauage. VVhat can bee looked for from Idolaters? If a man haue caſt

off his God, hee will eaſily caſt off his friends: When religion is once gone, humanitie will not ſtay long after.
                     That, which the people were puniſhed afterwards for but deſiring, he inioyes. Now is Abimelec ſeated in the throne which his Father refuſed, and no riuall is ſeene to enuy his peace: But how long will this glory laſt? Stay but three yeeres, and ye ſhall ſee this bramble withered, and burnt. The proſperitie of the wicked is ſhort and fickle; a ſtolne Crowne (tho it may looke faire) cannot be made of any but brittle ſtuffe. All life is vncertaine: but wickednes ouer-runnes nature.
                     
                        
The euill ſpirit thruſt himſelfe into the plot of Abimelechs vſurpation and murder, &amp; wrought with the Sechemites for both: and now God ſends the euill ſpirit betwixt Abimelec and the Sichemites, to work the ruine of each other. The firſt could not haue been without God; but in the ſecond, GOD challenges a part: Reuenge is his, where the ſinne is ours. It had bin pitty that the Sichemites ſhould haue been plagued by any other hand then Abimelecs; They raiſed him vniuſtly to the Throne, they are the firſt that feele the weight of his ſcepter. The fooliſh Bird limes herſelf with that which grew from her owne excretion: vvho wonders to ſee the kinde Peaſant ſtung with his owne ſnake?
                     
                        
The breach begins at Shechem; His own Countrimen flie off from their promiſed allegeance; Tho all Iſrael ſhould haue faln of from Abimelec, yet they of Shechem ſhold haue ſtuck cloſe: It was their act, they ought to haue made it good. How ſhould good Princes be honoured, when euen Abimelecs once ſettled cannot be oppoſed vvith ſafety? Now they begin the reuolt to the reſt of Iſrael. Yet, if this had been done out of repentance, it had bin praiſe-worthy; but to be done out of a trecherous inconſtancie, was vnworthy of Iſraelites. How could Abimelec hope for fidelity of them, whom he had made and found Traytors to his fathers bloud? No man knowes how to be ſure of him that is vnconſcionable;

He that hath bin vnfaithful to one, knowes the way to be perfidious, and is onely fit for his truſt, that is worthy to be deceiued; vvhereas faithfulneſſe, beſides the preſent good, laies a ground of further aſſurance. The friendſhip that is begun in euil, cannot ſtand; wickednes, both of it owne nature, and through the curſe of God, is euer vnſteddy: and thogh there be not a diſagreement in hell (being but the place of retribution, not of action) yet on earth, there is no peace among the wicked; whereas that affection which is knit in God, is indiſſoluble.
                     If the men of Shechem had abandoned their falſe God, with their falſe King, and out of a ſerious remorſe,

&amp; deſire of ſatisfaction for their idolatry &amp; bloud, had oppoſed this Tyrant, &amp; preferd Iotham to his throne, there might haue bin both warrant for their quarrel, and hope of ſucceſs: but now, if Abimelec be a wicked Vſurper, yet the Shechemites are Idolatrous Traytors. How could they thinke, that God wold rather reuenge Abimelecs bloody intruſion by them, then their trechery &amp; Idolatry by Abimelec? Whē the quarrel is betwixt God &amp; Satan, there is no doubt of the iſſue; but when one diuel fights with another, what certenty is there of the victory? Though the cauſe of God had bin good, yet it had bin ſafe for them to looke to thēſelues: the vnworthineſs of the agent many times, curſes a good enterpriſe.
                     
                        
No ſooner is a ſecret diſlike kindled in any people againſt their Gouernours, then there is a Gaal ready to blow the coales: It were a wonder if euer any faction ſhould want an Head; As contrarily, neuer any man was ſo ill, as not to haue ſome fauorers: Abimelec hath a Zebul in the midſt of Shechem; Lightly, all treaſons are betrayd euen with ſome of their owne; His intelligence brings the ſword of Abimelec vpon Shechem, who now hath demoliſhed the City, &amp; ſown it with ſalt. Oh the iuſt ſucceſsions of the reuenges of God! Gideons Ephod is puniſhed with the bloud of his ſonnes; the bloud of his ſons is ſhed by the procurement of the Shechemites; the bloud of the Shechemites is ſhed by Abimelec: the

bloud of Abimelec is ſpilt by a woman. The retaliations of God, are ſure and iuſt, &amp; make a more due pedigree, then deſcent of nature.
                     The purſued Shechemites, flie to the houſe of their god Berith; now they are ſafe: that place is at once a fort, and a ſanctuary. VVhether ſhould we fly in our diſtreſſe but to our GOD? And now this refuge ſhall teach them what a God they haue ſerued: The iealous God whom they had forſaken, hath them now where he would, &amp; reioyces at once to be reuenged of their god, &amp; them: Had they not made the houſe of Baal their ſhelter, they had not died ſo fearfully. Now, according to the prophecie of Iotham, a fire goes out of the

bramble, and conſumes theſe Cedars, and their eternall flames begin in the houſe of their Berith: the confuſion of wicked men, riſes out of the falſe Deities vvhich they haue doted on.
                     Of all the Conſpirators againſt Gideons ſonnes, only Abimelec yet ſuruiues, and his day is now comming. His ſucceſs againſt Shechem, hath filled his hart with thoughts of victorie; He hath caged vp the inhabitants of Tebez within their tower alſo; and what remaines for them, but the ſame end with their neighbours? And behold, while his hand is buſie in putting fire to the dore of their tower, which yet was not hie (for then he could not haue diſcerned a woman to be his

Executioner) a ſtone from a vvomans hand ſtrikes his head; His paine in dying, was not ſo much as his indignation to know by whom he died: &amp; rather wil he die twiſe, then a woman ſhal kill him. If God had not known his ſtomack ſo big, he had not vexed him with the impotency of his Victor: God findes a time to reckon with wicked men for all the arrerages of their ſinnes. Our ſins are not more our debts to God, then his iudgements are his debts to our ſinnes, which at laſt hee will be ſure to pay home. There now lies the greatneſs of Abimelec; vpon one ſtone had hee ſlaine his ſeuenty brethren, &amp; now a ſtone ſlaies him; His head had ſtolne the Crown of Iſrael, &amp; now his head is ſmitten: And what is

                        Abimelec better that he was a King? What difference is there betwixt him, and any of his ſeauenty brethren whom he murdred, ſaue only in guiltineſſe? They beare but their owne bloud; hee, the weight of all theirs. How happy a thing is it to liue well! that our death, as it is certaine, ſo may be comfortable: What a vanitie it is to inſult in the death of them, whom wee muſt follow the ſame way?
                     The Tyran hath his payment, &amp; that time which he ſhold haue beſtowed in calling for mereie to GOD, and waſhing his bloudie ſoule with the laſt teares of contrition, he vainly ſpends in deprecating an idle reproach; Kill me, that it may not be ſaid, He died by a woman:
                        
A fitte concluſion for ſuch a life. The expectation of true and endleſs torment, doth not ſo much vex him, as the friuolous report of a dishonor; neither is he ſo much troubled with, Abimelec is frying in hell, as, Abimelec is ſlaine by a woman. So, vaine fooles are niggardly of their reputation, &amp; prodigall of their ſoules; Doe we not ſee them runne wilfully into the field, into the graue, in
                           •
                        o hell? and all, leaſt it ſhold be ſaid, They haue but as much feare, as wit.

                           ISrael, that had now long gone a whoring from GOD, hath bin puniſhed by the regiment of the Concubines ſonne, and at laſt ſeekes protection from the ſonne of an harlot: It is no ſmall miſerie to be obliged vnto the vnworthy. The concubines ſon made ſute to them; They make ſute to the ſon

of the harlot. It was no fault of Ieptha that hee had an ill mother, yet is he branded with the indignitie of his baſtardie; neither would God conceale this blemiſh of nature, which Ieptha could neither auoyd, nor remedy. God, to ſhow his deteſtation of whoredom, reuenges it not onely vpon the actors, but vpon their iſſue: Hence he hath ſhut out the baſe-ſon from the congregation of Iſrael, to the tenth generation, that a tranſient euil might haue a durable reproch attending it; And that after the death of the Adulterer, yet his ſhame might liue. But, that God who iuſtly ties men to his lawes, will not abide that wee ſhould tie him to our lawes, or his owne; He can both rectifie and ennoble the

bloud of Ieptha. That no man ſhould be too much diſcouraged with the errors of his propagation, euen the baſe ſon of man may be the lawfully begotten of God; &amp; though hee be caſt out from the inheritance of his brethren vpon earth, may bee admitted to the kingdome of Iſrael.
                     I heare no praiſe of the lawfull iſſue of Gilead; onely this miſ-begotten ſonne is commended for his valour, and ſet at the ſterne of Iſrael: The common gifts of God reſpect not the parentage or blood, but are indifferently ſcattered where he pleaſes to let them fall. The choice of the Almighty, is not guided by our rules; As in ſpirituall, ſo in earthly things, it is not in

him that willeth: If GOD would haue men glory in theſe outward priuiledges, he would beſtow vpon them none but the worthy.
                     Now, who can bee proude of ſtrength or greatnes, when he ſees him that is not ſo honeſt, yet is more valiant, and more aduaunced? Had not Ieptha been baſe, he had not been thruſt out; and if he had not been thruſt out from his brethren, hee had neuer been the Captaine of Iſrael. By contrarie paſes to ours, it pleaſeth GOD to come to his owne ends: and how vſually doth he looke the contrary way, to that he moues? No man can meaſure the concluſion of Gods act by his beginning: Hee that fetches good out of euill,

raiſes the glory of men out of their ruine. Men loue to goe the neereſt way, and often faile: GOD commonly goes about, and in his owne time comes ſurely home.
                     The Gileadites were not ſo forward to expell Ieptha, as gladde to recall him; No Ammonite threatned them when they parted vvith ſuch an helper: Now, whom they caſt out in their peace, they fetch home in their danger and miſery. That God who neuer gaue ought in vaine, will finde a time to make vſe of any gift that hee hath beſtowed vpon men; The valour of Ieptha ſhall not ruſt in his ſecrecie, but bee imploied to the common preſeruation of Iſrael: Neceſsitie will driue vs to ſeeke vp all our

helps, euen thoſe whom our wantonneſſe hath deſpiſed.
                     How iuſtly are the ſutes of our need vp braided with the errors of our proſperitie? The Elders of Gilead now heare of their ancient wrong, and dare not finde fault with their exprobration; Did yee not hate mee, and expell me out of my Fathers houſe? How then come yee now to mee in time of Tribulation? The ſame expoſtulation that Ieptha makes with Gilead, GOD alſo at the ſame time makes with Iſrael; Ye haue for ſaken me, &amp; ſerued other Gods; wherefore ſhould I deliuer you any more: Goe &amp; cry vnto the gods whom ye haue ſerued. As we, ſo God alſo findes it ſeaſonable to tell his children of their faults, whiles hee

is whipping them. It is a ſafe and wiſe courſe, to make much of thoſe in our peace, whom we muſt make vſe of in our extremity; elſe it is but iuſt, that we ſhould be reiected of thoſe, whom we haue reiected. Can we look for any other anſwere from God then this? Did ye not driue me out of your houſes, out of your harts, in the time of your health and iollitie? Did yee not plead the ſtrictneſſe of my charge, &amp; the weight of my yoke? Did not your wilfull ſinnes expell mee from your ſoules? What doe you now crowching &amp; creeping to me in the euill day? Surelie, O God, it is but iuſtice, if thou bee not found of thoſe, which vvere glad to loſe thee; it is thy mercie, if after many checks, and delaies,

thou wilt be found at laſt. Where an act cannot be reuerſed, there is no amends, but confeſsion; and if God himſelfe take vp with this ſatisfaction, He that confeſses, ſhall finde mercy; how much more ſhold men hold thēſelues well paid with words of humilitie, and deprecation?
                     
                        Iepthaes wiſedome had not bin anſwerable to his valour, if he had not made his match before hand; He could not but know how trecherouſly Iſrael had dealt with Gideon. VVee cannot make too ſure worke, when we haue to doe with vnfaithfull men: It hath been an old policie to ſerue our ſelues of men; and after our aduantage, to turne them vp. He bargains therfore

for his Soueraignttie ere he winne it, Shall I be your Head? We are all naturally ambitious, and are ready to buy honor euen with hazard. And if the hope of a troubleſome ſuperioritie incouraged Ieptha to fight againſt the forces of Ammon, what hart ſhould vvee take in the battels of God againſt ſpirituall wickedneſſes, when the God of heauen hath ſaid, To him that ouercomes, will I giue power ouer nations, and to ſit with me in my Throne? Oh that wee could bend our eyes vpon the recompence of our reward; how willingly ſhould wee march forward againſt theſe mighty Ammonites! Ieptha is noted for his valour, and yet he intreates with Ammon, ere he fights. To make war any other then our

laſt remedy, is not courage, but cruelty and raſhneſs: And now, when reaſon will not preuaile, he betakes himſelfe to his ſword.
                     As God began the warre vvith Ieptha, in raiſing vp his hart to that pitch of fortitude; ſo Ieptha began his warre at GOD, in crauing victory from him, &amp; pouring out his vow to him: His hand tooke hold of his ſword; his hart, of God: therefore hee, whom the old Teſtament ſtiles valiant, the new, ſtiles faithfull; Hee who is commended for his ſtrength, dares truſt in none, but the arme of God: If thou wilt giue the Ammonites into my hand. If Ieptha had not lookt vpward for his victory, in vaine had the Gileadites lookt

vp to him: This is the diſpoſition of all good harts, they looke to their ſword, or their bowe, as ſeruants, not as Patrons; and whiles they vſe them, truſt to God. If we could doe ſo in all our buſineſſes, wee ſhould haue both more ioy in their ſucceſſe, and leſſe diſcomfort in their miſcariage.
                     It was his zeale to vow: it vvas his ſinne to vow raſhly. Iacob his fore-father, of whom hee learned to vow, might haue taught him a better forme; If GOD will bee with me, then ſhall the Lord be my God. It is well with vowes, when the thing promiſed makes the promiſe good: But when Ieptha ſaies, Whatſoeuer thing commeth out of the doores of my houſe, ſhall bee the

Lords, or I will offer it for a burnt ſacrifice; his deuotion is blind, and his good affection ouer-runnes his iudgement: For what if a dog, or a ſwine, or an aſſe had met him, where had been the promiſe of his conſecration?
                     Vowes are as they are made; like vnto ſents, if they bee of ill compoſition, nothing offends more; if well tempered, nothing is more pleaſant: Either certainty of euill, or vncertainty of good, or impoſsibilitie of performance, makes vowes no ſeruice to GOD. When we vow what we cannot, or what we ought not doe, we mock God inſteed of honoring him: It is a vaine thing for vs, to go about to catch God hood-winkt; The

conſcience ſhall neuer finde peace in any way, but that which we ſee before vs, and which we know ſafe both in the kind, and circumſtances. There is no comfort in (peraduenture I may pleaſe GOD.) What good child wil not take part of the Parents ioy? If Ieptha returne with Trophees, it is no maruell if his daughter meet him with Timbrels: Oh that we could be ſo affected with the glorious acts of our heauenly Father! Thou ſubdueſt thine enemies, and mightily deliuereſt thy people. O GOD, a ſong waiteth for thee in Sion.
                     Who vvould haue ſuſpected danger in a dutifull Triumph? VVell might Iepthaes daughter haue thought; My ſexe forbad me

to doe any thing towards the help of my Fathers victory; I can doe little, if I cannot applaud it; If nature haue made me weake, yet not vnthankfull; nothing forbids my ioy to be as ſtrong as the Victors; Though I might not goe out with my father to fight, yet I may meet him with gratulations; A Timbrel may become theſe hands which were vnfit for a ſword; This day hath made me the daughter of the Head of Iſrael; This day hath made both Iſrael free, my father a Conqueror, and my ſelfe in him noble: and ſhal my affection make no difference? What muſt my father needs think, if hee ſhall finde me ſitting ſullenly at home, whiles all Iſrael ſtriues who ſhall run firſt to bleſſe him with their acclamations?

Should I onely be inſenſible of his, and the common happineſſe?
                     And now, behold when ſhee lookes for moſt thanks, her father anſwers the meaſures of her feet, with the knockings of his breaſt, and weeps at her muſick, &amp; teares his clothes to looke vpon her, whom he beſt loued, and giues no anſwere to her Timbrels, but Alas my daughter, thou art of them that trouble mee: Her ioy alone hath changed the day, &amp; loſt the comfort of that victory, which ſhee inioyed to ſee won. It falls out often, that thoſe times and occaſions, which promiſe moſt contentment, prooue moſt dolefull in the iſſue: The hart of this Virgin was neuer

lifted vp ſo hie as now, neither did any day of her life ſeem happy but this; and this onely, proues the day of her ſolemne, and perpetuall mourning: As contrarilie the times and euents which wee haue moſt diſtruſted, proue moſt beneficiall. It is good in a fair morning, to thinke of the ſtorme that may riſe ere night, and to enioy both good and euill fearefully.
                     Miſerable is that deuotiō which troubles vs in the performance; Nothing is more pleaſant then the acts of true pietie: Ieptha might well ſee the wrong of this religion, in the diſtaſte of it; yet whiles himſelfe had troubled his daughter, hee faies, Alas my daughter, thou art of them that trouble mee.
                        
She did but her dutie, he did what he ſhould not; yet hee would be rid of the blame, tho he cannot of the ſmart. No man is willing to owne a ſin; the firſt man ſhifted it from himſelfe, to his wife; this, from himſelfe to his daughter: Hee was ready to accuſe another, which onely committed it himſelfe. It were happy if we could be as loth to commit ſinne, as to acknowledge it.
                     The inconſideration of this vow was very tough, and ſettled; I haue opened my mouth, and cannot goe backe. If there were iuſt cauſe to repent, it was the weakneſs of his zeale, to thinke that a vow could binde him to euill; An vnlawfull vow is ill made, but worſe

performed. It were pitty this conſtancie ſhould light vpon any, but an holy obiect: No lone can make a truer debt, then our vow; which if we pay not in our performance, God will pay vs with iudgement. We haue all opened our mouthes to God in that initiall, and ſolemn vow of Chriſtianity; Oh that wee could not goe backe! So much more is our vow obligatory, by how much the thing vowed is more neceſſary.
                     Why was the ſoule of Ieptha thus troubled, but becauſe he ſaw the entaile of his new honour thus ſuddenly cut off? He ſaw the hope of poſteritie extinguiſhed, in the virginity of his daughter. It is naturall to vs, to affect that perpetuitie

in our ſucceſsion, which is denied vs in our perſons; Our very bodies would emulate the eternity of the ſoule. And if GOD haue built any of vs an houſe on earth, as well as prepared vs an houſe in heauen, it muſt be confeſſed a fauour, worth our thankfulneſs: but as the perpetuitie of our earthlie houſes is vncertaine; ſo let vs not reſt our harts vpon that, but make ſure of the houſe which is eternall in the heauens.
                     Doubtleſſe, the goodnes of the daughter added to the fathers ſorow: Shee was not more louing, then religious; neither is ſhe leſſe willing to be the Lords, then her fathers: and as prouoking her father to that which he thought pietie,

though to her own wrong, ſhe ſaies, If thou haſt opened thy mouth vnto the Lord, doe with mee as thou haſt promiſed. Many a daughter would haue diſſwaded her father with teares, and haue wiſht rather her fathers impietie, then her own preiudice; Shee ſues for the ſmart of her fathers vowe. How obſequious ſhould children be to the will of their carefull Parents, euen in their finall diſpoſition in the world, when they ſee this holie maid willing to abandon the world vpon the raſh vow of a father? They are the liuing goods of their Parents, and muſt therefore waite vpon the beſtowing of their owners: They miſtake themſelues, which thinke they are their owne; If this maid had vowed herſelfe to

God vvithout her Father, it had been in his power to abrogate it; but now that hee vowed her to GOD vvithout her ſelfe, it ſtands in force. But what ſhall wee ſay to thoſe children, whom their Parents vow and care, cannot make ſo much as honeſt; that will be no other then godleſſe in ſpight of their Baptiſme, and education? What, but that they are giuen their Parents for a curſe, and ſhall one day finde what it is to bee rebellious.
                     All her deſire is, that ſhee may haue leaue to bewaile that which ſhe muſt be forced to keepe, Virginitie: If ſhee had not held it an affliction, there had been no cauſe to bewaile it; it had bin no thanke

to vnder-goe it, if ſhee had not known it to be a croſs. Teares are no argument of impatience; wee may mourne for that wee repine not to beare: How comes that to be a meritorious vertue vnder the Goſpell, which was but a puniſhment vnder the Law? The daughters of Iſrael had been too lauiſh of their teares, if virginitie had bin abſolutely good: VVhat iniurie ſhould it haue been to lament that ſpirituall preferment, which they ſhould rather haue emulated?
                     While Iepthaes daughter vvas two monethes in the mountaines, ſhe might haue had good opportunitie to eſcape her fathers vow; but as one, whom her obedience tyed as cloſe to her father, as his

vow tyed him to God, ſhe returns to take vp that burden, which ſhe had bewailed to foreſee: If we be truly dutifull to our father in heauen, wee would not ſlip our necks out of the yoke tho we might, nor flie from his commaunds, though the doore were open.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                     Sampſon conceiued.
                     
                        OF extraordinary perſons, the very birth &amp; conception is extraordinary; God beginnes his wonders betimes, in thoſe whō hee will make wonderfull: There was neuer any of thoſe which were miraculouſly conceiued, vvhoſe liues were not notable, and ſingular. The preſages of the wombe, and the cradle, are commonly anſwered in the life; It is not the vſe of GOD to caſt away ſtrange beginnings. If Manoahs wife had not been barren, the Angell had not

been barren, the Angell had not been ſent to her: Afflictions haue this aduantage, that they occaſion GOD to ſhow that mercy to vs, whereof the proſperous are vncapable; It would not beſeem a mother to bee ſo indulgent to an healthfull child, as to a ſick. It was to the woman that the Angell appeared, not to the husband; whether for that the reproach of barrenneſſe lay vpon her more heauily, then on the father; or for that the birth of the child ſhould coſt her more deare then her husband; or laſtly, for that the difficultie of this newes was more in her conception, then in his generation: As Satan layes his batteries euer to the weakeſt; ſo contrarily, God addreſſeth his comforts to thoſe

harts that haue moſt need; As, at the firſt, becauſe Eue had moſt reaſon to be deiected, for that her ſin had drawne man into the Tranſgreſsion, therefore the Cordiall of GOD moſt reſpecteth her; The ſeed of the Woman ſhall breake the Serpents head.
                     
                     As a Phyſitian firſt tells the ſtate of the diſeaſe with his Symptoms, and then preſcribes; ſo dooth the Angell of God, firſt tell the wife of Manoah her complaint, then her remedy; Thou art barren. All our afflictions are more noted of that GOD which ſends them, then of the Patient that ſuffers them: how can it be but leſſe poſsible to indure any thing that he knows not, than that hee inflicteth not? Hee

ſaith to one, Thou art ſicke; to an other, Thou art poore; to a third, Thou art defamed; Thou art oppreſſed, to another: That all-ſeeing Eye, takes notice from heauen of euery mans condition, no leſſe then if he ſhould ſend an Angel to tell vs he knew it; His knowledge compared with his mercy, is the iuſt comfort of all our ſufferings. O GOD, vvee are many times miſerable, and feele it not; Thou knoweſt euē thoſe ſorrowes which wee might haue; Thou knoweſt what thou haſt done: do what thou wilt.
                     
                        Thou art barren. Not that the Angel would vpbrayd the poore woman with her affliction; but therefore he names her paine, that

the mention of her cure might be ſo much more welcom; Comfort ſhal com vnſeaſonably to that hart which is not apprehenſiue of his owne ſorrow: We muſt firſt know our euils, ere we can quit them. It is the iuſt method of euery true Angel of GOD, firſt to let vs ſee that whereof either wee doe, or ſhould complaine, and then to apply comforts. Like as a good Phyſitian, firſt pulls downe the body, and then raiſes it with cordialls. If wee cannot abide to heare of our faults, wee are not capable of amendement.
                     If the Angel had firſt ſaid, Thou ſhalt conceiue, and not premiſed, Thou art barren; I doubt whether ſhee had conceiued faith in her

ſoule, of that infant which her body ſhould conceiue; Now, his knowledge of her preſent eſtate, makes way for the aſſurance of the future. Thus euer it pleaſes our good God, to leaue a pawne of his fidelitie with vs; that vvee ſhould not diſtruſt him in what he will do, when we find him faithfull in that which we ſee done.
                     It is good reaſon that he which giues the ſonne to the barren mother, ſhould diſpoſe of him, and diet him both in the wombe firſt, and after, in the world. The mother muſt firſt be a Nazarite, that her ſonne may be ſo. Whiles ſhee was barren, ſhe might drink what ſhe would: but now that ſhee ſhall conceiue a Sampſon, her choice

muſt be limited; There is an holie auſterity that euer followes the ſpeciall calling of GOD; The worldling may take his full ſcope, and deny his backe and belly nothing; but he that hath once conceiued that bleſſed burden, whereof Sampſon was a type, muſt bee ſtrict and ſeuere to himſelfe; neither his tongue, nor his palat, nor his hand may runne riot; Thoſe pleaſures which ſeemed not vnſeemly for the multitude, are now debarred him. We borrow more names of our Sauiour then one; As wee are Chriſtians, ſo wee are Nazarites, the conſecration of our God is vpon our heads; and therfore our very haire ſhould be holie. Our appetite muſt be curbed, our paſsions moderated, and ſo

eſtranged from the world, that in the loſſe of parents, or children, nature may not make vs forget grace. What doth the looſenes of vaine men perſwade them that God is not curious, when they ſee him thus preciſely ordering the very diet of his Nazarites? Nature pleades for liberty; religion for reſtraint: Not that there is more vncleanneſſe in the grape, then in the fountaine; but that wine findes more vncleanneſſe in vs, then water, and that the hie feede is not ſo fit for deuotion, as abſtinence. Who ſees not a ceremony in this commaund? VVhich yet carries with it this ſubſtance of euerlaſting vſe, that God and the bellie will not admit of one ſeruant; that quaffing and cramming is not the

way to heauen: A drunken Nazarite is a monſter among men. We haue now more ſcope then the ancient; not drinking of vvine, but drunkenneſſe with wine is forbidden to the Euangelicall Nazarite; wine, wherein is exceſs. Oh that euer Chriſtian ſhould quench the ſpirit of GOD, with a liquor of Gods owne making; That they ſhould ſuffer their hearts to bee drowned with wine, and ſhould ſo liue, as if the practice of the Goſpell, were quite contrary to the rule of the law.
                     The mother muſt conceiue the onely Giant of Iſrael, &amp; yet muſt drinke but water; neither muſt the child touch any other cup. Neuer wine made ſo ſtrong a Champion

as water did heere: The power of nouriſhment, is not in the creatures, but in their Maker. Daniel and his three companions kept their complexion, vvith the ſame diet where-with Sampſon got his ſtrength; he that gaue that power to the grape, can giue it to the ſtreame. O God, how iuſtlie doe wee raiſe our eyes from our tables vnto thee, which canſt make water nouriſh, and wine enfeeble vs!
                     
                        Sampſon had not a better mother, then Manoah had a wife; ſhe hides not the good newes in her owne boſome, but imparts it to her husband: That wife hath learned to make a true vſe of her Head, which is euer reade to conſult with him, about the meſſages

of God. If ſhee were made for his helper, hee is much more hers. Thus ſhould good women make amends for their firſt offence; that as Eue no ſooner had receiued an ill motion, but ſhe deliuered it to her husband; ſo they ſhould no ſooner receiue good, then they ſhould impart it.
                     
                        Manoah (like one which in thoſe lend times had not loſt his acquaintance with God) ſo ſoone as hee heares the newes, falls downe vpon his knees: I do not hear him call forth and addreſſe his ſeruants to all the coaſts of heauen (as the children of the prophets did in the ſearch of Elias) to finde out the meſſenger; but I ſee him rather looke ſtraight vp, to that GOD

which ſent him; My Lord, I pray thee let that man of God come again. As a ſtraight line is the ſhorteſt, the neereſt cutte to any bleſsing is to goe by heauen; As we may not ſue to God, and neglect meanes, ſo wee muſt ſue to GOD for thoſe meanes which we ſhall vſe.
                     Whē I ſee the ſtrength of Manoahs faith, I maruell not that hee had a Sampſon to his ſonne; he ſaw not the meſſenger, hee heard not the errand, hee examined not the circumſtances; yet now hee takes thought, not whether he ſhal haue a ſonne, but how he ſhall order the ſonne which hee muſt haue; and ſues to God, not for the ſon which as yet hee had not, but for the direction of gouerning him, when

he ſhould be. Zachariah heard the ſame meſſage, &amp; crauing a ſigne, loſt that voice wherwith he craued it: Manoah ſeekes no ſigne for the promiſe, but counſell for himſelfe; and yet, that Angel ſpake to Zachary himſelfe, this onely to the wife of Manoah; that, in the Temple like a glorious ſpirit; this, in the houſe, or fielde, like ſome Prophet, or Traueller; that to a Prieſt, this to a woman. All good men haue not equall meaſures of faith; The bodies of men haue not more differences of ſtature, then their graces: Credulity to men is faulty and dangerous; but in the matters of GOD, is the greateſt vertue of a Chriſtian; Happy are they that haue not ſeene, yet belieued: True faith takes all for granted,

yea for performed, vvhich is once promiſed.
                     Hee that before ſent his Angel vnasked, will much more ſend him againe, vpon intreatie; thoſe heauenly meſſengers are readie both to obey their Maker, and to relieue his children. Neuer any man prayed for direction in his duties to God, and was repulſed: rather will God ſend an Angel from heauen to inſtruct vs, then our good deſires ſhall be fruſtrate.
                     
                        Manoah prayed, the Angel appeared againe; not to him, but to his wife. It had been the ſhorter way, to haue come firſt to the man whoſe prayers procured his preſence: But as Manoah went directlie,

and immediatly to GOD, ſo God comes mediatly &amp; about to him; and will make her the meanes to beare the meſſage to her huſband, who muſt beare him the ſonne: Both the bleſsing and the charge are chiefely meant to her. It was a good care of Manoah, whē the Angel had giuen order to his wife alone, for the gouerning of the childs diet, to profer himſelfe to this charge; How ſhall we order the child? As both the Parents haue their part in the being of their children, ſo ſhould they haue in their education; it is both vnreaſonable and vnnaturall in huſbands, to caſt this burden vpon the weaker veſſel alone: it is no reaſon that ſhe which alone hath had the paine of their birth, ſhould haue

the pain of their breeding. Thogh the charge be renued to the wife, yet the ſpeech is directed to the husband; the act muſt be hers, his muſt be the ouer-ſight; Let her obſerue all that I haue commanded her. The head muſt ouer-look the body; it is the duty of the husband to be carefull that the wife do her dutie to GOD.
                     As yet, Manoah ſaw nothing but the out-ſide of a man, and therfore offers the Angel an anſwerable entertainment, wherein there is at once Hoſpitality and Thankfulneſs. No man ſhal bring him good newes from GOD, and goe away vnrecompenced; How forward he is to feaſt him, whom hee tooke for a Prophet: their feet ſhould be

ſo much more beautifull, that bring vs newes of ſaluation, by how much their errand is better.
                     That Manoah might learn to acknowledge God in this man, hee ſets off the proffer of his thankfulnes from himſelfe, to God; and (as the ſame Angel which appeared to Gideon) turnes his feaſt into a ſacrifice: And now he is Manoahs ſolicitor to better thanks than hee offered. How forward the good Angels are to incite vs vnto pietie! Either this was the Sonne himſelf, which ſaid It was his meat and drinke to doe his Fathers will, or elſe one of his ſpirituall attendance of the ſame diet. Wee can neuer feaſt the Angels better, then with our harty ſacrifices to God;

Why do not we learne this leſſon of them, whom wee propound to our ſelues as the patterns of our obedience? We ſhall be once like the Angels in condition, why are wee not in the meane time in our diſpoſitions? If wee doe not prouoke, and exhort one another to godlineſſe, and doe care more for a feaſt, then a ſacrifice, our appetite is not Angelicall, but brutiſh.
                     It was an honeſt minde in Manoah, whiles hee was addreſsing a ſacrifice to God, yet not to neglect his meſſenger; faine would he know whom to honour; True pietie is not vnciuill, but whiles it magnifies the authour of all bleſſings, is thankfull to the meanes: Secondary cauſes are woorthy of

regard: neither need it detract any thing from the praiſe of the agent, to honor the inſtrument. It is not onely rudeneſs, but iniuſtice in thoſe, which can bee content to heare good newes from God, with contempt of the bearers.
                     The Angell wil neither take nor giue, but conceales his very name from Manoah. All honeſt motions are not fit to be yeelded to; good intentions are not alwayes ſufficient grounds of condiſcent. If wee doe ſomtimes aske what we know not, it is no maruell if wee receiue not what wee aske. In ſome caſes, the Angel of God tells his name vnasked, as Gabriel to the Virgin; heere, not by intreaty: If it were the Angel of the couenant, he had

as yet no name but Iehouah; if a created Angel, hee had no commiſsion to tell his name; &amp; a faithful meſſenger hath not a word beyond his charge: Beſides that, hee ſaw it would bee of more vſe for Manoah, to know him really, then by words. Oh the bold preſumption of thoſe men, which (as if they had long ſoiourned in heauen, and been acquainted with all the holy Legions of ſpirits) diſcourſe of their orders; of their titles, when this one Angels ſtoppes the mouth of a better man then they, with Why dooſt thou aske after my name, which is ſecret? Secret things to God; reuealed, to vs and our children. No word can be ſo ſignificant as actions; The act of the Angel tels beſt who hee was;

Hee did wonderfully: wonderfull therefore was his name. So ſoon as euer the flame of the ſacrifice aſcended, hee mounted vp in the ſmoke of it; that Manoah might ſee the ſacrifice, and the meſſenger belonged both to one God; and might know, both whence to acknowledge the meſſage, and whence to expect the performance.
                     
                        Gideons Angel vaniſhed at his ſacrifice, but this in the ſacrifice; that Manoah might at once ſee both the confirmation of his promiſe, and the acceptation of his obedience, whiles the Angel of God vouchſafed to perfume himſelfe with that holy ſmoke, &amp; carry the ſent of it vp into heauē. Manoah
                        
belieued before, and craued no ſigne to aſſure him; God voluntarily confirmes it to him aboue his deſire: To him that hath, ſhall be giuen. Where there are beginnings of faith, the mercy of GOD will adde perfection.
                     How doe we thinke Manoah and his wife looked to ſee this ſpectacle? They had not ſpirit enough left to looke one vpon another: but in ſteed of looking vp cheerefully to heauen, they fall downe to the earth, on their faces; as weak eyes are dazeled with that which ſhould comfort them. This is the infirmitie of our nature, to be afflicted with the cauſes of our ioy; to be aſtoniſhed with our confirmations; to cōceiue death in that

viſion of God, wherein our life &amp; happineſs conſiſts. If this homely ſight of the Angell did ſo confound good Manoah, what ſhal become of the enemies of God, whē they ſhall be brought before the glorious Tribunall of the God of Angels?
                     I maruell not now, that the Angel appeared both times rather to the wife of Manoah; her faith was the ſtronger of the two. It falls out ſometimes, that the weaker veſſel is fuller; and that of more precious liquor: that wife is no helper which is not ready to giue ſpirituall comfort to her husband; The reaſon was good, and irrefragable, If the Lord were pleaſed to kill vs, hee would not haue receiued a burnt

offring from vs; God will not accept gifts, where he intēds puniſhment, and profeſſes hatred. The ſacrifice of the vvicked, is an abomination to the Lord: If wee can finde aſſurance of Gods acceptation of our ſacrifices, wee may be ſure hee loues our perſons. If I incline to wickednes in my hart, the Lord will not heare mee; but the Lord hath heard mee.
                  
                  
                     
                     Sampſons marriage.
                     
                        OF all the Deliuerers of Iſrael, there is none of whom are reported ſo many weakeneſſes, or ſo many miracles, as of Sampſon: The newes which the Angell told of his conception and education, was not more ſtrange, then the newes of his owne choice; hee but ſees a daughter of the Philiſtims, and falls in loue; All this ſtrength beginnes in infirmitie; One maid of the Philiſtims, ouer-comes that Champion which was giuen to ouercome the Philiſtims: Euen hee

that was dieted with water, found heat of vnfit deſires: As his bodie was ſtrong notwithſtanding that fare, ſo were his paſsions; without the gift of continencie, a lowe feed may impaire nature, but not inordination. To follow nothing but the eye in the choice of his vvife, was a luſt vnworthy of a Nazarite; This is to make the ſenſe not a Counſellor, but a Tyran.
                     Yet was Sampſon in this verie impotencie, dutifull; Hee did not in the preſumption of his ſtrength rauiſh her forceably; Hee did not make vp a clandeſtine match without conſulting his Parents, but he makes ſute to them for conſent; Giue mee her to wife: As one that could be maſter of his owne act,

tho not of his paſsion; and as one that had learned ſo to be a ſutor, as not to forget himſelfe to bee a ſonne. Euen in this deplored ſtate of Iſrael, children durſt not preſume to be their own caruers; how much leſs is this tolerable in a welguided and Chriſtian Commonwealth? Whoſoeuer now diſpoſe of themſelues without their Parents, they doe wilfully vn-child themſelues, and change naturall affection for violent.
                     It is no maruell if Manoah and his wife were aſtoniſhed at this vnequall motion of their ſon; Did not the Angell (thought they) tell vs that this child ſhould be conſecrated to God, and muſt he begin his youth in vnholy wedlock? Did

not the Angel ſay that our ſonne ſhould beginne to ſaue Iſrael from the Philiſtims, and is he now captiued in his affections by a daughter of the Philiſtims? Shall our deliuerance from the Philiſtims beginne in an alliance? Haue we bin ſo ſcrupulouſly carefull, that hee ſhould eate no vncleane thing, &amp; ſhall wee now conſent to an heatheniſh match? Now therefore they grauely indeauour to coole this intemperate heat of his paſsion, with good counſell; as thoſe which well knew the inconueniences of an vnequall yoke; corruption in religion, alienation of affections, diſtraction of thoughts, conniuence at Idolatry, death of zeale, dangerous vnderminings, and laſtly, an vnholy ſeed: Who

can blame them if they were vnwilling to call a Philiſtim, daughter?
                     I wiſh Manoah could ſpeake ſo loud that all our Iſraelites might heare him; Is there neuer a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all Gods people, that thou goeſt to take a wife of the vncircumciſed Philiſtims? If religion be any other then a cypher, how dare we not regard it in our moſt important choice? Is ſhee a faire Philiſtim? Why is not this deformitie of the ſoule more powerfull to diſſwade vs, then the beautie of the face, or of metall to allure vs? To dote vpon a faire skinne when we ſee a Philiſtim vnder it, is ſenſuall and brutiſh.
                     
                        
Affection is not more blind, thē deafe. In vaine doe the Parents ſeeke to alter a young man, not more ſtrong in body, then in will; Tho he cannot defend his deſires, yet he purſues them; Get mee her, for ſhe pleaſes mee. And although it muſt needs be a weake motion that can plead no reaſon, but appetite; yet the good Parents, ſith they cannot bow the affection of their ſonne with perſwaſion, dare not breake it with violence. As it becomes not children to bee forward in their choice; ſo Parents may not be too peremptorie in their denial; It is not ſafe for children to ouer-runne Parents in ſetling their affections; nor for Parents (where the impediments are not very materiall) to come ſhort

of their children, when the affections are once ſettled: The one is diſobedience; the other may be tyranny.
                     I know not whether I may excuſe either Sampſon in making this ſute, or his Parents in yeelding to it, by a diuine diſpenſation in both: For on the one ſide, whiles the ſpirit of God notes, that as yet his parents knew not this was of the Lord, it may ſeeme that hee knew it; and is it likely hee would know and not impart it? This alone was enough to win, yea to command his Parents; It is not mine eye onely, but the counſell of God, that leades me to this choice; The way to quarrell with the Philiſtims, is to match with them; If I follow mine

affection, mine affection followes God, in this proiect. Surely, hee that commaunded his Prophet afterwards to marry an harlot, may haue appointed his Nazarite to marry with a Philiſtim: On the other ſide, whether it were of God permitting, or allowing, I find not; It might ſo be of God, as all the euill in the Citie; and then the interpoſition of Gods decree, ſhall be no excuſe of Sampſons infirmitie. I would rather think, that God meant onely to make a Treacle of a Viper; and rather appointed to fetch good out of Sampſons euill, then to approue that for good in Sampſon, which in it ſelfe was euil.
                     When Sampſon went on wooing, he might haue made the ſluggards

excuſe, There is a Lion in the way: but he that could not be ſtaied by perſwaſion, will not by fear. A Lion, young, wilde, fierce, hungry, comes roring vpon him when hee had no weapon but his hand, no fence but his ſtrength; the ſame Prouidence that carried him to Timnah, brought the Lion to him. It hath been euer the faſhion of God, to exerciſe his Champions with ſome initiatory incounters: Both Sampſon &amp; Dauid muſt firſt fight with Lions, then with Philiſtims; &amp; he whoſe type they bore, meets with that roring Lion of the wilderneſſe, in the very threſhold of his publique charge. The ſame hand that prepared a Lion for Sampſon, hath proportionable matches for euery Chriſtian; God

neuer giues ſtrength, but hee imployes it: Pouerty, meets one like an armed man; Infamy, like ſome furious maſtiue, comes flying in the face of another; the wild Bore out of the forreſt, or the bloudie Tyger of perſecution ſets vpon one; the brawling curres of hereticall prauitie or cōtentious neighbourhood, are ready to bait another: and by all theſe meaner and brutiſh aduerſaries, wil God fit vs for greater conflicts: It is a pledge of our future victory ouer the ſpirituall Philiſtims, if we can ſay, My ſoule hath been among Lions. Come forth now thou weak Chriſtian, and behold this preparatorie battel of Sampſon; Doſt thou think GOD deales hardly with thee in matching thee ſo hard, and calling

thee forth to ſo many fraies? What dooſt thou but repine at thine own glory? How ſhouldſt thou be victorious, without reſiſtance?
                     If the Parents of Sampſon had now ſtood behind the hedge and ſeene this incounter, they vvould haue taken no further care of matching their ſonne with a Philiſtim; For who that ſhould ſee a ſtrong Lion ramping vpon an vnarmed man, would hope for his life and victory? The beaſt came briſtling vp his fearefull mane, wafting his raiſed ſterne, his eyes ſparkling with furie, his mouth roaring out knells of his laſt paſſage, and breathing death from his noſtrills, and now reioyced at ſo faire a prey. Surely, if the Lion had had no other

aduerſary then him whom he ſaw, hee had not loſt his hope; but now he could not ſee that his Maker was his enemy; The ſpirit of the Lord came vpon Sampſon; What is a beaſt in the hand of the Creator? He that ſtrooke the Lions with the awe of Adam, Noah, and Daniel, ſubdued this rebellious beaſt to Sampſon; VVhat maruell is it, if Sampſon now tore him, as if it had bin a young Kid? If his bones had been braſſe, and his skin plates of iron, all had been one: The right hand of the Lord bringeth mighty things to paſs.
                     If that roring Lion, that goes about continually ſeeking whom he may deuour, find vs alone among the vineyards of the Philiſtims,

where is our hope? Not in our heeles; hee is ſwifter then we: not in our weapons; we are naturally vnarmed: not in our hands, which are weak and languiſhing; but in the ſpirit of that GOD, by whom we can do all things: if God fight in vs, who can reſiſt him? There is a ſtronger Lion in vs, then that againſt vs.
                     
                        Sampſon was not more valiant then modeſt; hee made no words of this great exploit: the greateſt performers euer make the leaſt noyſe; He that works wonders alone, could ſay, See thou tell no man; where as thoſe, whoſe hands are moſt impotent, are buſieſt of their tongues. Great talkers ſhow that they deſire only to be thought

eminent, whereas the deepeſt waters are leaſt heard.
                     But, whiles he concealed this euent from others, hee pondred it in himſelfe; and when hee returned to Timnath, went out of the way to ſee his dead Aduerſary, and could not but recal to himſelfe his danger, and deliuerance; Heere the beaſt met me, thus he fought, thus I ſlew him. The very dead Lion taught Sampſon thankfulneſſe: there was more hony in this thought, then in the carcaſſe. The mercies of GOD are ill beſtowed vpon vs, if we cannot ſteppe aſide to view the monuments of his deliuerances; Dangers may bee at once paſt, &amp; forgotten. As Sampſon had not found his hony-comb,

if he had not turned aſide to ſee his Lion; ſo we ſhall loſe the comfort of Gods benefits, if we doe not renue our perills by meditation.
                     Leaſt any thing ſhould befall Sampſon, wherein is not ſome wonder, his Lion doth more amaze him dead, then aliue; For loe, that carcaſſe is made an Hiue; &amp; the bitterneſſe of death, is turned into the ſweetneſs of hony. The Bee, a nice &amp; dainty creature, builds her cells in an vnſauory carcaſſe; the carcaſs that promiſed nothing but ſtrength, and annoyance, now offers comfort &amp; refreſhing; and in a ſort, payes Sampſon for the wrong offered. Oh the wonderfull goodnes of our GOD, that can change our terrors into pleaſure, and can

make the greateſt euils beneficiall! Is any man, by his humiliation vnder the hand of GOD, growne more faithfull, and conſcionable? there is hony out of the Lion. Is any man by his temptation or fall become more circumſpect? there alſo is hony out of the Lion: there is no Sampſon to whom euery Lion dooth not yeeld hony: Euerie Chriſtian is the better for his euils; yea, Satan himſelfe, in his exerciſe of Gods children, aduantageth them.
                     
                        Sampſon doth not diſdaine theſe ſweets, becauſe he finds them vncleanly layd; His diet was ſtrict, and forbad him any thing that ſauour'd of legall impurity; yet hee eates the hony-combe out of the

belly of a dead beaſt; Good may not be refuſed, becauſe the means are accidentally euil; Hony is hony ſtill, tho in a dead Lion. Thoſe are leſſe wiſe, and more ſcrupulous then Sampſon, which abhorre the graces of God, becauſe they finde them in ill veſſels: One cares not for the Preachers true doctrine, becauſe his life is euill; Another will not take a good receit from the hand of a Phyſitian, becauſe he is giuen to vnlawfull ſtudies; A 3d, wil not receiue a deſerued contribution from the hands of a Vſurer. It is a weak neglect not to take the hony, becauſe we hate the Lion: Gods children haue right to their fathers bleſsings, whereſoeuer they finde them.
                     
                        
The match is now made; Sampſon (tho a Nazarite) hath both a wedding, and afeaſt; God neuer miſliked moderate ſolemnities in the ſeuereſt life; and yet this Bridall-feaſt was long, the ſpace of ſeuen daies. If Sampſon had matched with the beſt Iſraelite, this celebration had been no greater; neither had this perhaps been ſo long, if the cuſtome of the place had not required it. Now I doe not heare him pleade his Nazaritiſme, for a colour of ſingularitie: It is both lawfull and fit, in things not prohibited, to conforme our ſelues to the manners and rites of thoſe with whom we liue.
                     That Sampſon might think it an honour to match with the Philiſtims,

hee whom before the Lion found alone, is now accompanied with thirty attendants; They called them companions, but they meant them for ſpies: The curteſies of the world are hollow and and thankleſſe; neither doth it euer purpoſe ſo ill, as when it ſhowes faireſt. None are ſo neere to danger, as thoſe whom it entertains with ſmiles; whiles it frownes, wee knowe what to truſt to; but the fauours of it are worthy of nothing but feares &amp; ſuſpicion: Open defiance is better then falſe loue.
                     Auſteritie had not made Sampſon vnciuill; hee knowes how to entertaine Philiſtims with a formall familiaritie: And that his intellectuall

parts might be approued anſwerable to his armes, hee will firſt try maiſteries of wit, and ſet their braines on worke vvith harmleſs thoughts; His riddle ſhal appoſe them, and a deepe wager ſhall hinde the ſolution; Thirtie ſhirts, and thirty ſutes of raymem; neither their loſſe, nor their gaine could be much, beſides the victory, beeing diuided vnto thirtie partners: but Sampſons muſt needs bee both waies very large, vvho muſt giue or receiue thirty alone. The ſeauen dayes of the feaſt are expiring, and yet they which had been all this while deuouring of Sampſons meat, cannot tell who that cater ſhould be from whence meat ſhold come. In courſe of nature, the ſtrong feeder takes-in

meat, and ſends out filthineſs; but, that meat and ſweetneſſe ſhould come from a deuouring ſtomack, was beyond their apprehenſion.
                     And as fooles and dogges vſe to beginne in ieſt, and end in earneſt, ſo did theſe Philiſtims; and therefore they force the Bride to intice her husband to betray himſelfe. Couetouſnes &amp; Pride haue made them impatient of loſs: and now they threat to fire her, and her fathers houſe, for recompence of their entertainment, rather then they will loſe a ſmall wager to an Iſraelite. Some-what of kinne to theſe ſauage Philiſtims, are thoſe cholerick Gameſters, which if the dice bee not their friend, fall out with GOD, curſe (that which is

not) Fortune; ſtrike their fellowes, and are ready to take vengeance vpon themſelues: Thoſe men are vnfit for ſport, that loſe their patience together with their wager.
                     I do not wonder that a Philiſtim woman loued herſelfe and her fathers family, more then an Iſraelitiſh Bride-groome; and if ſhee beſtowed teares vpon her husband, for the ranſome of them. Sampſon himſelfe taught her this difference, I haue not told it my father or my mother, and ſhould I tell it thee? If ſhe had not been as ſhee was, fhee had neither done this to Sampſon, nor heard this from him; Matrimoniall reſpects are dearer then naturall; It was the law of him that ordained marriage (before euer

Parents were) that Parents ſhould bee forſaken, for the husband or wife: But now, Iſraelitiſh Parents are woorthy of more intireneſſe, then a wife of the Philiſtims; And yet, whom the Lion could not conquer, the teares of a woman haue conquered. Sampſon neuer bewrayed infirmitie but in vxoriouſnes; What aſſurance can there be of him that hath a Philiſtim in his boſome? Adam, the perfecteſt man, Sampſon, the ſtrongeſt man, Salomon, the wiſeſt man, were betrayed with the flattery of their helpers. As there is no comfort comparable to a faithfull yokefellow, ſo wo be to him that is matched with a Philiſtim.
                     
                        
It could not but much diſcōtent Sampſon, to ſee that his aduerſaries had plowed with his heifer, &amp; that vpon his own back; now therfore hee payes his wager to their coſt. Aſcalon the Citie of the Philiſtims is his wardrobe, he fetches thence thirty ſutes, lined with the liues of the owners: Hee might vvith as much eaſe haue ſlaine theſe thirtie companions, which were the Authors of this euill; but his promiſe forbad him whiles he was to clothe their bodies, to vnclothe their ſoules; and that ſpirit of GOD, which ſtird him vp to reuenge, directed him in the choice of the ſubiects. If we wonder to ſee thirtie throates cut for their ſutes, wee may eaſily know, that this was but the occaſion of that ſlaughter,

whereof the cauſe was their oppreſsion, and tyranny. Dauid ſlew two hundred Philiſtims for their fore-skinnes: but the ground of his act was their hoſtilitie. It is iuſt with God to deſtine what enemies he pleaſes, to execution: It is not to be expoſtulated why this man is ſtriken rather then another, vvhen both are Philiſtims.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                     Sampſons victorie.
                     
                        I Can no more iuſtifie Sampſon in the leauing of his wife, then in the chuſing her; He choſe her becauſe ſhe pleaſed him; and becauſe ſhee deſpiſed him, hee left her: Though her feare made her falſe to him in his Riddle, yet ſhee was true to his bed; That vveake trechery was worthy of a check, not a deſertion. All the paſsions of Sampſon were ſtrong, like himſelf: but (as vehement motions are not laſting) this vehemēt wind is ſoone allayd; and hee is now returning

with a Kid to winne her that had offended him, and to renue that feaſt which ended in her vnkindneſſe. Slight occaſions may not breake the knot of matrimoniall loue; and if any iuſt offence haue ſlackned it on either part, it muſt be faſtned again by ſpeedy reconciliation.
                     Now Sampſons father in law ſhowes himſelfe a Philiſtim, the true Parent of her that betrayed her husband; for no ſooner is the Bride-groome departed, then he changes his ſonne: what pretence of friendſhippe ſoeuer he made, a true Philiſtim will ſoone be wearie of an Iſraelite. Sampſon hath not ſo many dayes libertie to enioy his wedding, as hee ſpent in celebrating

it: Marriage hath been euer a ſacred inſtitution, and who but a Philiſtim would ſo eaſily violate it? One of his thirtie companions enioyes his wife, together with his ſute; &amp; now laughes to be a partner of that bed, whereon hee was an attendant. The good nature of Sampſon, hauing forgottē the firſt wrong, carried him to a proffer of familiarity, and is repulſed; but vvith a gentle violence, I had thought thou hadſt hated her. Lawfull wedlock may not be diſſolued by imaginations, but by proofes.
                     Who ſhall ſtay Sampſon from his owne wife? Hee that ſlew the Lion in the way of his wooing, and before whom thouſands of the Philiſtims could not ſtand, yet ſuffers

himſelfe to be reſiſted, by him that was once his father in law, without any returne of priuate violence.
                     Great is the force of dutie once conceiued, euen to the moſt vnworthy; This thought, I was his ſonne, bindes the hands of Sampſon: Elſe how eaſily might hee that ſlew thoſe thirty Philiſtims for their ſutes, haue deſtroyed this familie for his wife? How vnnatural are thoſe mouthes, that can curſe the loynes from which they are proceeded; and thoſe hands that dare lift vp themſelues againſt the meanes of their life and being?
                     I neuer read that Sampſon ſlew any but by the motion and aſsiſtance

of the ſpirit of GOD: and the Diuine wiſedome hath reſerued theſe offenders to another reuenge; Iudgement muſt deſcend from others to thē, ſith the wrong proceeded from others, by them. In the very marriage God foreſaw and intended this parting, and in the parting this puniſhment vpon the Philiſtims. If the Philiſtims had not bin as much enemies to God, as to Sampſon; enemies to Iſrael in their oppreſsion, no leſſe then to Sampſon, in this particular iniurie, that purpoſe and execution of reuenge, had been no better then wicked: Now he to whom vengeance belongs, ſets him on worke, and makes the act iuſtice: when he commaunds, euen very crueltie is obedience.
                     
                        
It was a buſie and troubleſome proiect of Sampſon, to vſe the foxes for his reuenge: for not without great labour &amp; many hands could ſo many wilde creatures be gotte together, neither could the wit of Sampſon want other deuiſes of hoſtilitie; But he meant to finde out ſuch a puniſhmēt, as might in ſom ſort anſwere the offence, &amp; might imply as much contempt, as treſpaſſe. By wiles, ſeconded with violence, had they wronged Sampſon, in extorting his ſecret, and taking away his wife: &amp; what other Embleme could theſe foxes tied together preſent vnto them, then wilineſs combined by force, to worke miſchiefe?
                     
                        
Theſe foxes deſtroy their corn, before he which ſent them, deſtroy the perſons. Thoſe iudgements which beginne in outward things, end in the owners; A ſtranger that had been of neither ſide, vvould haue ſaid, What pitty it is to ſee good corn thus ſpoiled: If the creature be conſidered apart frō the owners, it is good; and therefore if it be miſ-ſpent, the abuſe reflects vpon the maker of it; but if it be looked vpon, with reſpect to an ill maſter, the beſt vſe of it, is to periſh. He therefore that ſlew the Egyptian cattell with murrain, &amp; ſmote their fruit with haile-ſtones; hee that conſumed the vines of Iſrael with the Palmer-worme, and Caterpiller, and Canker-worme; ſent alſo foxes by the hand of

                        Sampſon, into the fields of the Philiſtims. Their corne was too good for them to enioy, not too good for the foxes to burn vp; God had rather his creature ſhould periſh any way, then ſerue for the luſt of the wicked.
                     There could not be ſuch ſecrecy in the catching of three hundred foxes, but it might well be knowne who had procured them: Rumor will ſwiftly fly of things not done: but of a thing ſo notoriouſly executed, it is no maruell if Fame be a blab. The mention of the offence drawes in the prouocation: &amp; now the wrong to Sampſon is ſcanned &amp; reuenged; Becauſe the fieldes of the Philiſtims, are burned for the wrong done to Sampſon by the

                        Timnite in his daughter, therefore the Philiſtims burne the Timnite &amp; his daughter. The tying of the firebrand between two foxes, was not ſo witty a policy, as the ſetting of a fire of diſſenſion betwixt the Philiſtims: What need Sampſon be his owne executioner, when his enemies will vndertake that charge? There can be no more pleaſing proſpect to an Iſraelite, then to ſee the Philiſtims together by the eares.
                     If the vvife of Sampſon had not feared the fire for herſelfe, and her fathers houſe, ſhe had not betrayed her husband, her husband had not thus plagued the Philiſtims, the Philiſtims had not conſumed her and her father with fire: now ſhee

leapes into that flame which ſhee meant to auoid. That euill which the wicked feared, meets them in their flight: How many in a feare of pouerty, ſeeke to gaine vnconſcionably, and die beggers? How many to ſhunne paine and danger haue yeelded to euill, and in the long runne haue been met in the teeth with that miſchiefe which they had hoped to haue left behind them? How many, in a deſire to eſchue the ſhame of men, haue fallen into the confuſion of God? Both good and euill are ſure paymaſters at the laſt.
                     Hee that was ſo ſoone pacified towards his wife, could not but haue thought this reuenge more then enough, if he had not rather

wielded Gods quarrell then his owne; He knew that GOD had raiſed him vp on purpoſe, to be a ſcourge to the Philiſtims, whom as yet he had angred more then puniſhed: As if theſe therefore had been but floriſhes before the fray, he ſtirres vp his courage, &amp; ſtrikes them both hip and thigh, vvith a mighty plague. That God vvhich can do nothing imperfecty, where he begins either mercy or iudgement, will not leaue till hee haue happily finiſhed: As it is in his fauours, ſo in his puniſhments; One ſtroke drawes on another.
                     The Iſraelites were but ſlaues, &amp; the Philiſtims were their maſters: ſo much more indignely threfore muſt they needs take it, to be thus

affronted by one of their owne vaſſals: yet ſhall we commend the moderation of theſe Pagans; Sampſon, beeing not mortally wronged by one Philiſtim, falls foule vpon the whole Nation; the Philiſtims hainouſly offended by Sampſon, doe not fall vpon the whole Tribe of Iudah, but being muſtered together, call to them for ſatisfaction from the perſon offending: the ſame hand of God which wrought Sampſon to reuēge, reſtrained them from it; It is no thanke to themſelues, that ſometimes wicked men cannot bee cruell.
                     The men of Iudah, are by their fear made friends to their Tyrans, &amp; traytors to their friend; it was in

their cauſe that Sampſon had ſhed bloud, and yet they conſpire with 
                           •
                        he Philiſtims, to deſtroy their own fleſh and bloud. So ſhal the Philiſtims be quit with Iſrael, that as Sampſon by Philiſtims, reuenged himſelf of Philiſtims; ſo they of an Iſraelite, by the hand of Iſraelites. That which open enemies dare not attempt, they worke by falſe brethren; and theſe are ſo much more perilous, as they are more entire.
                     It had been no leſſe eaſie for Sampſon to haue ſlaine thoſe thouſands of Iudah that came to binde him, then thoſe other of the Philiſtims, that meant to kill him bound: And what if he had ſaid; Are yee turnd Traytors to your

Deliuerer? your bloud bee vpon your owne heads. But the ſpirit of God (without whom he could not kill either beaſt, or man) would neuer ſtirre him vp to kill his brethren, tho degenerated into Philiſtims; they haue more power to binde him, then hee to kill them: Iſraelitiſh bloud was precious to him, that made no more ſcruple of killing a Philiſtim, then a Lion: That bondage and vſury that was allowed to a Iew from a Pagan, might not bee exacted from a Iew.
                     The Philiſtims that had before plowed with Sampſons heifer in the caſe of the Riddle, are now plowing a worſe furrow with an heifer more his owne. I am aſhamed to

heare theſe cowardly Iewes ſay, Knowſt thou not that the Philiſtims are Lords ouer vs? Why haſt thou done thus vnto vs? We are therefore come to binde thee: Whereas they ſhould haue ſaid; Wee find theſe tyrannicall Philiſtims to vſurp dominion ouer vs; thou haſt happily begun to ſhake off their yoke, and now wee are come to ſecond thee with our ſeruice; the valor of ſuch a Captain ſhall eaſily lead vs forth to liberty; We are ready either to die with thee, or to be freed by thee: A fearefull man can neuer be a true friend; rather then incur any danger, hee will be falſe to his owne ſoule. Oh cruell mercie of theſe men of Iuda! We will not kill thee, but we will bind thee, and deliuer thee to the hands of the Philiſtims,

that they may kill thee. As if it had not been much worſe to die an ignominious and tormenting death, by the hands of Philiſtims, then to bee at once diſpatcht by them, which wiſht either his life ſafe, or his death eaſie.
                     When Saul was purſued by the Philiſtims vpon the mountaines of Gilboa, he could ſay to his Armorbearer, Draw forth thy ſword, and kill mee, leaſt the vncircumciſed come and thruſt me thorough, &amp; mock mee; and at laſt, would rather fall vpon his own ſword, then theirs: And yet theſe coſins of Sampſon, can ſay, Wee will not kill thee, but we will bind thee, &amp; deliuer thee. It was no excuſe to theſe Iſraelites, that Sampſons binding had

more hope, then his death; It was more in the extraordinary mercie of God, then their will, that he was not tyed with his laſt bonds: Such is the goodneſs of the Almightie, that he turnes the cruell intentions of wicked men to an aduantage.
                     Now theſe Iewes that might haue let thēſelues looſe from their owne bondage, are binding their Deliuerer, whom yet they knew able to haue reſiſted. In the greateſt ſtrength, there is vſe of patience; There was more fortitude in this ſuffering, then in his former actions; Sampſon abides to be tied by his owne countrymen, that hee may haue the glory of freeing him ſelfe victoriouſly. Euen ſo, O Sauiour, our better Nazarite, thou

which couldſt haue called to thy Father, and haue had twelue legions of Angels for thy reſcue, wouldſt be bound voluntarily, that thou mightſt triumph; So the bleſſed Martyrs were racked, &amp; would not be loſed, becauſe they expected a better reſurrection: If we be not as well ready to ſuffer ill, as to doe good, wee are not fit for the conſecration of God.
                     To ſee Sampſon thus ſtrongly manicled, and expoſed to their full reuenge, could not but bee a glad ſpectacle to theſe Philiſtims; &amp; their ioy was ſo full, that it could not but flie forth of their mouthes in ſhouting and laughter; whom they ſaw looſe with terror, it is pleaſure to ſee bound. Is is the ſport of

the ſpirituall Philiſtims, to ſee any of Gods Nazarites fettered with the cords of iniquitie; and their Imps are ready to ſay, Aha, ſo would wee haue it. But the euent anſwers their falſe ioy, with that clauſe of triumph, Reioyce not ouer me, O mine enemy: tho J fall, yet I ſhall riſe againe. How ſoone vvas the countenance of theſe Philiſtims changed, and their ſhouts turn'd into ſhriekings? The ſpirit of the Lord came vpon Sampſon, and then, what are cords to the Almighty? His new bonds are as flax burnt with fire; and he rouzes vp himſelfe, like that young Lion whom he firſt incountred, &amp; flyes vpon thoſe cowardly aduerſaries, who if they had not ſeen his cords, durſt not haue ſeene his face. If

they had been ſo many diuels, as men, they could not haue ſtood before that ſpirit, which lifted vp the hart &amp; hand of Sampſon. Wicked men neuer ſee fairer proſpect, then when they are vpon the verie threſhold of deſtruction; Securitie and Ruine, are ſo cloſe bordering vpon each other, that where we ſee the face of the one, we may be ſure the other is at his backe. Thus didſt thou, O bleſſed Sauiour, when thou wert faſtned to the Croſſe, when thou layeſt bound in the graue with the cords of death; thus didſt thou miraculouſly raiſe vp thy ſelfe, and vanquiſh thine enemies, and lead captiuitie captiue; Thus do all thy holy ones when they ſeem moſt forſaken, &amp; laid open to the inſultation of the

world, finde thy ſpirit mightie to their deliuerance, and the diſcomfiture of their malicious aduerſaries.
                     Thoſe three thouſand Iſraelites were not ſo ill aduiſed, as to come vp into the rock vnweaponed, to apprehend Sampſon; Sampſon therfore might haue had his choice of ſwords, or ſpeares, for this skirmiſh with the Philiſtims; yet hee leaues all the munition of Iſrael, &amp; finding the new iaw-bone of an Aſſe, takes that vp in his hand, and with that baſe inſtrument of death, ſends 1000 Philiſtimes to their place. All the ſwords and ſhields of the armed Philiſtims, cannot reſiſt that contemptible Engine, which hath novv left a thouſand

bodies, as dead as the carcaſſe of that beaſt, whoſe bone it was. This victory was not in the weapon, was not in the arme: it was in the ſpirit of God, which moued the weapon in the arme. O God, if the meanes bee weake, yet thou art ſtrong: Through God we ſhal do great acts; Yea, I can do all things through him that ſtrengtheneth me. Seeſt thou a poore Chriſtian, which by weake counſell hath obtained to ouercome a tentation, there is the Philiſtim vanquiſht with a ſory iaw-bone.
                     It is no maruell, if he were thus admirably ſtrong, and victorious, whoſe bodily ſtrength God meant to make a type of the ſpirituall power of Chriſt: And behold, as

the three thouſands of Iuda ſtood ſtill gazing with their weapons in their hands, while Sampſon alone ſubdued the Philiſtims; ſo did men and Angels ſtand looking vpon the glorious atchieuements of the Sonne of God, who might iuſtlie ſay, I haue trode the wine-preſse alone.
                     
                     Both the Sampſons complained of thirſt; The ſame GOD which gaue his Champion victory, gaue him alſo refreſhing; and by the ſame meanes; The ſame bone yeelds him both conqueſt, &amp; life; and is of a weapon of offence, turned into a vvell of water: He that fetcht water out of the flint for Iſrael, fetches it out of a bone for Sampſon. What is not poſsible to

the infinite power of that Almightie Creator, that made all things of nothing? He can giue Sampſon hony from the mouth of the Lion, and water from the mouth of the Aſſe. Who would not cheerfully depend vpon that God, which can fetch moiſture out of drineſſe, and life out of death?
                  
                  
                     
                     Sampſons End.
                     
                        I Cannot wonder more at Sampſons ſtrength then his weakeneſſe; He that beganne to caſt away his loue vpon a wife of the Philiſtims, goes on to miſspend himſelfe vpon the harlots of the Philiſtims: Hee that did not ſo much ouercome the men, as the women ouercome him. His affections blinded him firſt, ere the Philiſtims could doe it: would he elſe, after the effuſion of ſo much of their bloud, haue ſuffered his luſt to carry him within their walls, as one

that cared more for his pleaſure, then his life? Oh ſtrange debauchedneſſe, and preſumption of a Nazarite: The Philiſtims are vp in Armes to kill him; he offers himſelfe to their Citie, to their ſtewes, and dares expoſe his life to one of their harlots, whō hee had ſlaughtered. I would haue looked to haue ſeen him betake himſelfe to his ſtronger rock, then that of Etam, and by his auſtere deuotion, to ſeeke protection of him, of whom he receiued ſtrength: but now, as if hee had forgotten his conſecration, I finde him turnd Philiſtim for his bed, and of a Nazarite, ſcarce a man. In vain doth hee nouriſh his haire, whiles hee feedes theſe paſsions. How vſually doe vigor of body, and infirmitie

of minde lodge vnder one roofe? On the contrary, a weariſh out-ſide is a ſtrong motiue to mortification: Sampſons victories haue ſubdued him, &amp; haue made him firſt a ſlaue to leud deſires, &amp; then to the Philiſtims. I may ſafely ſay, that more veſſels miſcarrie with a faire gale, then with a tempeſt.
                     Yet was not Sampſon ſo blinded with luſt, as not at all to looke before him; he foreſaw the morning would be dangerous, the bed of his fornication therefore could hold him no longer thē midnight; then he riſes, &amp; in a mock of thoſe ambuſhes which the Azabites laid for him, he carries away the gates wherein they thought to haue incaged

him. If a temptation haue drawn vs aſide, to lie down to ſin, it is happy for vs if we can ariſe ere wee be ſurpriſed with iudgement. Sampſon had not left his ſtrength in the bed of an harlot; neither had that God which gaue it him, ſtript him of it with his clothes, when he layd him down in vncleaneneſſe: His mercy vſes not to take vantage of our vnwoorthineſſe, but euen when we caſt him off, holds vs faſt. That bountifull hand leaues vs rich of common graces, when we haue miſ-ſpent our better ſtore: Like as our firſt Parents, when they had ſpoiled themſelues of the image of their Creator, yet were left vvealthie of noble faculties of the ſoule.
                     
                        
I finde Sampſon come off from his ſinne with ſafety; he runnes away lightly with an heauier weight then the gates of Azzah, the burden of an ill act. Preſent impunity argues not an abatement of the wickedneſs of his ſinne, or of the diſlike of God; nothing is ſo worthy of pitty, as a ſinners peace: Good is not therefore good becauſe it proſpers, but becauſe it is commaunded; Euill is not euil becauſe it is puniſhed, but becauſe it is forbidden.
                     If the holy Parents of Sampſon, liued to ſee theſe outrages of their Nazarite, I doubt whether they did not repent them of their ioy 
                           •
                        o heare newes of a ſonne. It is a 
                           •
                        hame to ſee how hee that might

not drinke wine, is drunk with the cup of fornications; His luſt carries him from Azzah to the plain of Sorek, &amp; now hath found a Dalilah, that ſhall pay him for all his former vncleaneneſs. Sin is ſteepe and ſlippery; and if after one fall we haue found where to ſtand, it is the praiſe, not of our footing, but of the hand of God.
                     The Princes of the Philiſtims knew already where Sampſons weakeneſs lay, though not his ſtrength; and therfore they would entiſe his harlot by gifts, to entiſe him by her daliance, to betray him ſelfe. It is no maruell, if ſhee which would be filthy, wold be alſo perfidious. How could Sampſon chuſe but thinke, if luſt had not bewitched

him, Shee whoſe bodie is mercenary to mee, will eaſily ſell me to others; Shee will be falſe, if ſhe will be an harlot? A wide conſcience will ſwallow any ſin: Thoſe that haue once thrall'd themſelues to a known euill, can make no other difference of ſinnes, but their owne loſſe, or aduantage: A lyer wil ſteale; a theefe can kil; a cruell man can be a Traytor; a drunkard can falſifie; wickedneſſe once entertained, can put on any ſhape: Truſt him in nothing, that makes not a conſcience of euery thing.
                     VVas there euer ſuch another motion made to a reaſonable man? Tell me wherein thy great ſtrength lieth, &amp; wherwith thou maiſt be bound to doe thee hurt. VVho would not

haue ſpurned ſuch a ſutor out of doores? What wil not impudency aske, or ſtupiditie receiue? Hee that killed the thouſand Philiſtims for cōming to binde him, indures this harlot of the Philiſtims to conſult with himſelfe of binding him; and when vpon the triall of a falſe anſwer, hee ſaw ſo apparent trechery, yet wilfully betrayes his life by her, to his enemies: All ſinnes, all paſsions haue power to infatuate a man; but luſt moſt of all. Neuer man that had drunke flagons of wine, had leſſe reaſon, then this Nazarite; Many a one loſes his life: but this caſts it away; not in hatred of himſelfe, but in loue to a ſtrumpet. We wonder that a man could poſsibly be ſo ſottiſh, &amp; yet we our ſelues by tentation becom

no leſſe inſenſate; Sinful pleaſures like a common Dalilah, lodge in our boſoms, we knowe they aime at nothing but the death of our ſoule; we wil yeeld to them, &amp; die: Euery willing ſinner is a Sampſon; let vs not inuey againſt his ſenſeleſnes, but our owne: Nothing is ſo groſſe &amp; vnreaſonable to a well diſpoſed minde, which tentation will not repreſent fit, and plauſible: No ſoule can out of his owne ſtrength, ſecure himſelfe from that ſin which he moſt deteſteth.
                     As an hood-winkt man ſees ſom little glimmering of light, but not enough to guide him; ſo did Sampſon, who had reaſon enough left him to make triall of Dalilah, by a crafty miſ-information; but not enough

vpon that tryall, to diſtruſt, and hate her; hee had not wit enough to deceiue her thriſe; not enough to keepe himſelfe from being deceiued by her. It is not ſo great wiſedom to proue thē whom wee diſtruſt, as it is folly to truſt them whom wee haue found trecherous: Thriſe had he ſeene the Philiſtims in her chamber, ready to ſuſpriſe him, vpon her bonds; and yet will needs be a ſlaue to his Traytor. Warning not taken, is a certaine preſage of deſtruction; and if once neglected it receiue pardon, yet thriſe is deſperate.
                     VVhat man would euer play thus with his owne ruine? His harlot bindes him, and calls-in her executioners to cut his throat; hee

riſes to ſaue his owne life, and ſuffers them to carry away theirs, in peace. Where is the courage of Sampſon? Where his zeale? Hee that killed the Philiſtims for their clothes; Hee that ſlew a thouſand of them in the field at once; in this quarrell, now ſuffers them in his chamber vnreuenged. Whence is this? His hands were ſtrong, but his hart was effeminate; his harlot had diuerted his affection. Whoſoeuer ſlackens the raines to his ſenſuall appetite, ſhall ſoone grow vnfitte for the calling of GOD. Sampſon hath broke the greene withies, the new ropes, the woofe of his haire, &amp; yet ſtill ſuffers himſelfe fettered with thoſe inuiſible bonds of an harlots loue; and can indure her to ſay, How canst thou

ſay, I loue thee, when thy hart is not with mee; thou haſt mocked me theſe three times: Wheras he ſhould rather haue ſaid to her; How canſt thou challenge any loue from me, that haſt this thriſe ſought my life? Or canſt thou thinke my mocks a ſufficient reuenge of this trecherie? But contrarily, he melts at this fire; and by her importunate inſinuations, is wrought againſt himſelfe. Wearineſſe of ſolicitation, hath won ſome to thoſe actions, which at the firſt motion they deſpiſed; like as wee ſee ſome ſutors are diſpatcht, not for the equity of the cauſe, but the trouble of the proſccution; becauſe it is more eaſie to yeelde, not more reaſonable. It is more ſafe to keepe our ſelues out of the noyſe of ſuggeſtions,

then to ſtand vpon our power of deniall.
                     Who can pitty the loſſe of that ſtrength which was ſo abuſed? who can pitty him the loſs of his locks, which after ſo many warnings can ſleepe in the lappe of Dalilah? It is but iuſt that he ſhould riſe vp from thence, ſhauen and feeble; not a Nazarite, ſcarce a man. If his ſtrength had lyen in his hair, it had been out of himſelfe; it was not therefore in his locks, it was in his conſecration, whereof that haire was a ſigne. If the razor had come ſooner vpon his head, he had ceaſed to be a Nazarite; and the gift of God had at once ceaſed, vvith the calling of GOD; not for the want of that excretion, but for the

want of obedience. If God withdrawe his graces, when hee is too much prouoked, who can complain of his mercie? He that ſleeps in ſin, muſt looke to wake in loſſe, and weakeneſs. Could Sampſon thinke, Though I tell her my ſtrength lies in my haire, yet ſhee will not cut it; or though ſhee doe cut my haire, yet ſhal I not loſe my ſtrength; that now hee riſes and ſhakes himſelfe in hope of his former vigor? Cuſtome of ſucceſſe, makes men confident in their ſins, and cauſes them to miſtake an arbitrary tenure for a perpetuity.
                     His eyes were the firſt offenders, which betrayed him to luſt: and now they are firſt pull'd out; and he is ledde a blind captiue to

                        Azzah, where hee was firſt captiued to his luſt. The Azzahites, which lately ſaw him not without terror, running lightly away with their gates at mid-night, ſee him now in his owne perpetuall night, ſtruggling with his chaines: and that he may not want paine, together with his bondage, hee muſt grind in his priſon.
                     As hee paſſed the ſtreet, euery boy of the Philiſtims could throw ſtones at him, euery woman could laugh, and ſhout at him; and what one Philiſtim doth not ſay, whiles he laſhes him vnto bloud, There is for my brother, or my kinſman, whom thou ſleweſt. Who can look to runne away with a ſinne, when Sampſon a Nazarite is thus plagued?

This great hart could not but haue broken with indignation, if it had not pacified it ſelfe with the conſcience of the iuſt deſert of all this vengeance.
                     It is better for Sampſon to bee blinde in priſon, then to abuſe his eyes in Sorek: yea, I may ſafelie ſay, hee was more blinde when he ſaw licentiouſly, then now, that hee ſees not; Hee was a greater ſlaue when hee ſerued his affections, then now in grinding for the Philiſtims. The loſſe of his eyes ſhowes him his ſin; neither could hee ſee how ill hee had done, till hee ſaw not.
                     Euen yet, ſtill the God of mercy lookt vpon the blindneſs of Sampſon,
                        
and in theſe fetters enlargeth his heart from the worſe priſon of his ſinne; His haire grew together with his repentance, &amp; his ſtrength with his haire. Gods merciful humiliations of his owne, are ſometimes ſo ſeuere, that they ſeeme to differ little from deſertions; yet at the worſt, he loues vs bleeding: &amp; when we haue ſmarted enough, wee ſhall feele it.
                     VVhat thankfull Idolaters were theſe Philiſtims? They could not but knowe, that their bribes, and their Dalilah, had deliuer'd Sampſon to them, and yet they ſacrifice to their Dagon; and, as thoſe that would be liberall in caſting fauors vpon a ſenſeleſſe Idol (of vvhom they could receiue none) they cry

out, Our God hath deliuered our enemy into our hands. Where vvas their Dagon, when a thouſand of his clients were ſlaine with an aſſes iaw? There was more ſtrength in that bone, then in all the makers of this God; and yet theſe vaine Pagans ſay, Our God. It is the qualitie of Superſtition to miſ-interpret all euents, and to feed it ſelfe with the conceit of thoſe fauours, which are ſo farre from beeing done, that their Authors neuer were. Why doe not we learn zeale of Idolaters? And if they be ſo forward in acknowledgemēt of their deliuerances to a falſe deitie; how cheerefully ſhould we aſcribe ours to the true? O God, whatſoeuer be the meanes, thou art the Author of all our ſucceſſe: Oh that

men would praiſe the Lord for his goodnes, and tell the wonders that he doth for the ſonnes of men!
                     No Muſician would ſerue for this feaſt, but Sampſon; hee muſt now bee their ſport, which was once their terror; that hee might want no ſorrow, ſcorne is added to his miſerie: Euery wit, and hand playes vpon him; Who is not readie to caſt his bone, and his ieſt at ſuch a captiue? So as doubtleſſe hee wiſht himſelfe no leſſe deafe, then blinde, and that his ſoule might haue gone out with his eyes. Oppreſsion is able to make a wiſe man mad: and the greater the courage is, the more painfull the inſultation.
                     
                        
Now Sampſon is puniſhed, ſhall the Philiſtims eſcape? If the iudgement of God beginne at his own, what ſhall becom of his enemies? This aduantage ſhal Sampſon make of their tyranny, that now death is no puniſhment to him, his ſoule ſhall flie foorth in this bitterneſſe, without pain; &amp; that his dying reuenge ſhal be no leſs ſweet to him, then the liberty of his former life: He could not but feel God mockt through him; and therfore whiles they are ſcoffing, hee prayes; his ſeriouſneſs hopes to pay them for all thoſe ieſts. If he could haue bin thus earneſt with God, in his proſperity, the Philiſtims had vvanted this laughing ſtock: No deuotion is ſo feruent, as that which ariſes frō extremity; O Lord God, I pray

thee think vpon me; O God I beſeech thee ſtrengthen mee at this time onely. Tho Sampſons haire were ſhorter, yet he knew Gods hand was not; as one therefore that had yet eyes 
                           •
                        ow to ſee him that was inuiſible, and whoſe faith was recouered before his ſtrength, hee ſues to that God, which was a party in this indignitie, for power to reuenge his wrongs, more then his owne: It is zeale that moues him, and not malice; his renued faith tells him, that he was deſtin'd to plague the Philiſtims: &amp; reaſon tells him, that his blindnes puts him out of the hope of ſuch another oportunity. Knowing therefore, that this play of the Philiſtims muſt end in his death, he recollects all the forces of his ſoule and body, that his death may be a

puniſhment in ſteed of a diſport; and that his ſoule may bee more victorious in the parting, then in the animation: and ſo addreſſes himſelfe both to die, and kill; as one, whoſe ſoule ſhall not feele his own diſſolution, whiles it ſhal carry ſo many thouſand Philiſtims with it to the pit. All the acts of Sampſon are for wonder, not for imitation: So didſt thou, O bleſſed Sauiour, our better Sampſon, conquer in dying; and triumphing vpon the charriot of the Croſſe, didſt lead captiuity captiue; The law, ſin, death, hell, had neuer bin vanquiſht, but by thy death; All our life, liberty, and glory, ſprings out of thy moſt precious bloud.
                  
                  
                     
                     Michaes Idolatrie.
                     
                        THE mother of Micha hath loſt her ſiluer, and now ſhe falls to curſing: She did afterwards but change the forme of her God; her ſiluer was her God, ere it did put on the faſhion of an Image: Elſe ſhe had not ſo much curſed to loſe it, if it had not too much poſſeſſed her in the keeping. A carnall hart cannot forgoe that wherein it delights, without impatience; cannot be impatient, vvithout curſes: whereas the man that hath learned to inioy GOD, and vſe the world,

ſmiles at a ſhipwrack, and pitties a theefe, and cannot curſe, but pray.
                     
                        Micha had ſo little grace, as to ſteale from his mother; and that out of wantonneſſe, not out of neceſsity; for, if ſhee had not been rich, ſo much could not haue been ſtoln from her; and now, hee hath ſo much grace as to reſtore it; her curſes haue fetcht again her treaſures; Hee cannot ſo much loue the mony, as hee feares her imprecations; Wealth ſeemes too deare bought with a curſe; Tho his fingers were falſe, yet his heart was tender. Many that make not conſcience of committing ſinne, yet make conſcience of facing it: It is well for them, that they are but

nouices in euill; thoſe whom cuſtome hath fleſhed in ſinne, can either deny and forfweare, or excuſe and defend it: their ſeared hearts cannot feele the gnawing of any remorſe; and their forhead hath learned to be as impudent, as their hart is ſenſeleſs.
                     I ſee no argument of any holineſſe in the mother of Micha; Her curſes were ſinne to her ſelfe, yet Micha dares not but feare them. I knowe not whether the cauſeleſſe curſe be more worthy of pitty, or derifion; it hurts the author, not his aduerſary: but the deſerued curſes, that fall euen from vnholy mouthes, are worthy to be feared: How much more ſhould a man hold himſelfe blaſted with the iuſt

imprecations of the godlie? What metall are thoſe made of, that can applaude themſelues in the bitter curſes which their oppreſsions haue wrung from the poore, and reioyce in theſe ſignes of their proſperity?
                     Neither yet was Micha more ſtriken with his mothers curſes, then with the conſcience of ſacriledge: ſo ſoone as he findes there was a purpoſe of deuotion in this treaſure, he dares not conceale it, to the preiudice (as he thought) of GOD, more then of his mother. What ſhall we ſay to the palate of thoſe men, which as they finde no good reliſh but in ſtoln waters; ſo beſt in thoſe, which are ſtoln from the fountaine of God? How ſoone

hath the old woman changed her note? Euen now ſhe paſſed an indefinite curſe vpon her ſonne for ſtealing; and now ſhee bleſſes him abſolutely, for reſtoring, Bleſsed be my ſonne of the Lord. Shee hath forgotten the theft, when ſhee ſees the reſtitution; How much more ſhall the God of mercies be more pleaſed with our confeſsion, then prouoked with our ſinne?
                     I doubt not but this ſiluer, and this ſuperſtition came out of Egypt, together with the mother of Micha. This hiſtory is not ſo late in time, as in place; for the Tribe of Dan was not yet ſetled in that firſt diuiſion of the promiſed land; ſo as this old woman had ſeen both the Idolatry of Egypt, &amp; the golden

calfe in the wilderneſſe; and no doubt contributed ſome of her earings to that Deity; and after all the plagues which ſhee ſaw inflicted vpon her brethren, for that Idol of Horeb, and Baal-Peor, ſhe ſtil reſerues a ſecret loue to ſuperſtition, and now ſhowes it. Where miſ-religion hath once poſſeſſed it ſelfe of the hart, it is very hardly clenſed out; but (like the plague) it will hang in the very clothes, &amp; after long lurking, breake forth in an vnexpected infection; and old wood is the apteſt to take this fire: After all the ayring in the Deſert, Michaes mother will ſmell of Egypt.
                     It had been better the ſiluer had been ſtoln then thus beſtowed; for

now they haue ſo imployed it, that it hath ſtoln away their harts from GOD; and yet, while it is molten into an Image, they thinke it dedicated to the Lord; If Religion might be iudged according to the intention, there ſhould ſcarce be any idolatry in the world. This woman loued her ſiluer enough; and if ſhee had not thought this coſtly piety, worth thanks, ſhee knew which way to haue imploied her ſtocke to aduantage: Euen euill actions haue oft-times good meanings, and thoſe good meanings are anſwered with euill recompences; Many a one beſtows their coſt, their labour, their blood, and receiues torment in ſteed of thanks.
                     
                        
Behold a ſuperſtitious ſon of a ſuperſtitious mother; She makes a God, and hee harbours it; Yea, (as the ſtreame is commonly broader then the head) he exceedes his mother in euill: He hath an houſe of Gods, an Ephod, Teraphin; &amp; that he might be complete in his deuotion, he makes his ſonne his Prieſt, and feoffes that ſinne vpon his ſonne, which he receiued from his mother. Thoſe ſinnes vvhich nature conuayes not to vs, wee haue by imitation; Euery action and geſture of the Parents, is an example to the child; and the mother, as ſhe is more tender ouer her ſonne, ſo by the power of a reciprocall loue, ſhe can worke moſt vpon his inclination; Whence it is that in the hiſtory of the Iſraelitiſh

Kings, the mothers name is commonly noted: and as ciuilly, ſo alſo morally, The birth followes the belly; Thoſe ſonnes may bleſſe their ſecond birth, that are deliuered from the ſinnes of their education.
                     Who cannot but thinke how far Micha ouer-lookt all his fellow Iſraelites, and thought them profane and godleſſe in compariſon of himſelfe? How did hee ſecretly clap himſelfe on the breaſt, as the man, whoſe happineſſe it was to ingroſs religion from all the tribes of Iſrael, and little can imagine, that the further hee runs, the more out of the way. Can an Iſraelite be thus Paganiſh? O Micha! how hath ſuperſtition bewitched thee,

that thou canſt not ſee rebellion in euery of theſe actions, yea in euery circumſtance, rebellion? What, more Gods then one? An houſe of Gods, beſide Gods houſe? An Image of ſiluer to the inuiſible GOD? An Ephod, and no Prieſt? A Prieſt beſides the family of Leui? A Prieſt of thine owne begetting, of thine own conſecration? What monſters dooth mans imagination produce when it is forſaken of God? It is wel ſeen there is no King in Iſraell; If God had been their King, his lawes had ruled them: If Moſes or Ioſhua had been their King, their ſword had awed them; If any other, the courſes of Iſrael could not haue been ſo headleſſe. We are beholden to Gouernment for order, for peace,

for religion; Where there is no King, euery one will bee a King, yea a God to himſelfe; VVee are worthy of nothing but confuſion, if we bleſſe not GOD for authoritie.
                     It is no maruell if Leuites wandred for maintenance, whiles there was no King in Iſrael; The tithes and offerings were their due: if theſe had been paid, none of the holy Tribe needed to ſhift his ſtation. Euen vvhere royall power ſeconds the claime of the Leuite, the iniuſtice of men ſhortens his right. What ſhould becom of the Leuites if there were no King? And what of the Church if no Leuites? No King therefore, no Church; How could the impotent

childe liue without a Nurſe? Kings ſhall be thy nurſing fathers, and Queens thy nurſes, ſaith God. Nothing more argues the diſorder of any Church, or the decay of religion, then the forced ſtragling of the Leuites. There is hope of growth, when Micha rides to ſeek a Leuite; but vvhen the Leuite comes to ſeek a ſeruice of Micha, it is a ſigne of gaſping deuotion.
                     
                        Micha was no obſcure man; all Mount Ephraim could not but take notice of his domeſticall Gods. This Leuite could not but heare of his diſpoſition, of his miſdeuotion; yet vvant of maintenance, no leſſe then conſcience, drawes him on, to the danger of an idolatrous patronage: Holineſs is

not tyed to any profeſsion; Happie were it for the Church, if the Clergy could be a priuiledge from leudneſſe. When need meets with vnconſcionableneſs, all conditions are eaſily ſwallowed, of vnlawfull entrances, of wicked executions: Ten ſhekels, and a ſute of apparell, and his diet, are good wages for a needy Leuite. Hee that could beſtow eleuen hundred ſhekels vpon his puppets, can afford butten to his Prieſt: ſo hath hee at once a rich Idoll, and a beggerlie Prieſt. Whoſoeuer affects to ſerue God, good cheape, ſhowes, that hee makes GOD but a ſtale to Mammon.
                     Yet was Micha a kinde Patron, tho not liberall; Hee calls the

young Leuite his father, and vſes him as his ſonne; &amp; what he wants in means, ſupplies in affection. It were happy, if Chriſtians could imitate the loue of Idolaters, towards them which ſerue at the Altar. Micha made a ſhift vvith the Prieſthood of his owne ſonne; yet that his heart checks him in it, appeares, both by the change, &amp; his contentment in the change; Now I knowe that the Lord will be good to mee, ſeeing I haue a Leuite to my Prieſt: Therefore, whiles his Prieſt was no Leuite, hee ſees there was cauſe, why GOD ſhould not bee good to him. If the Leuite had not comne to offer his ſeruice, Michaes ſonne had been a lawfull Prieſt; Many times the conſcience runnes away ſmoothly with an vnwarrantable

action, and reſts it ſelfe vpon thoſe grounds, which afterward it ſees cauſe to condemne. It is a ſure way therfore to informe our ſelues throughly ere we ſettle our choice, that wee be not driuen to reuerſe our acts with late ſhame, and vnprofitable repentance.
                     Now did Micha beginne to ſee ſome little glimpſe of his own error; He ſaw his Prieſthood faultie, he ſaw not the faults of his Ephod, of his Images, of his Gods, &amp; yet (as if he thought all had been well, when hee had amended one) hee ſayes, Now I know the Lord will be good to mee. The carnall hart pleaſes it ſelfe with an outward formalitie; and ſo delights to flatter it ſelfe, as that it thinks, if one circumſtance

be right, nothing can be amiſſe.
                     
                        Iſrael was at this time extremely corrupted; yet the ſpyes of the Danites had taken notice euen of this young Leuite, and are glad to make vſe of his Prieſthood. If they had but gone vp to Shilo, they might haue conſulted with the Arke of God: but worldly minds are not curious in their holy ſeruices; If they haue a God, an Ephod, a Prieſt, it ſuffices them; They had rather inioy a falſe worſhip with eaſe, then to take paines for the true: Thoſe that are curious in their diet, in their purchaſes, in their attire, in their contracts, yet in Gods buſineſſes are very indifferent.
                     
                        
The author of lyes ſometimes ſpeakes truth for an aduantage: &amp; from his mouth, this flattering Leuite ſpeakes what he knew would pleaſe, not what hee knew would fall out; The euent anſwers his prediction, and now the ſpyes magnifie him to their fellowes: Michaes Idol is a God, and the Leuite is his Oracle. In matter of iudgement, to be guided onely by the euent, is the way to error; Falſhood ſhall be truth, and Satan an Angell of light, if we follow this rule; Euen very coniectures ſomtimes happen right; A Prophet, or Dreamer may giue a true ſigne, or wonder, and yet himſelfe ſay, Let vs goe after other Gods. A ſmall thing can winne credite with weake mindes, which where they

haue once ſped, cannot diſtruſt.
                     The idolatrous Danites are ſo beſotted with this ſucceſs, that they wil rather ſteale, thē want the gods of Micha; and becauſe the Gods without the Prieſt can doe them leſſe ſeruice, then the Prieſt without the Gods, therfore they ſteale the Prieſt with the gods. O miſerable Iſraelites! that could think that a God, which could be ſtoln; that could looke for protection from that, which could not keep it ſelfe from ſtealing; which was won by their theft, not their deuotion: Could they worſhip thoſe Idols more deuoutly then Micha that made them? And if they could not protect their maker from robbery, how ſhall they protect their theeues? If it had been the holie

Arke of the true God, how could they thinke it would bleſſe their violence, or that it wold abide to be tranſlated by rapine, and extortion? Now their ſuperſtition hath made them mad vpon a God, they muſt haue him; by what meanes they care not, tho they offend the true God, by ſtealing a falſe. Sacriledge is fit to be the firſt ſeruice of an Idol. The ſpyes of Dan had bin curteouſly intertained by Micha: thus they reward his hoſpitalitie. It is no truſting the honeſtie of Idolaters: if they haue once caſt off the true God, whom will they reſpect?
                     It ſeemes, Leuites did not more vvant maintenance, then Iſrael wanted Leuites; Heere was a tribe

of Iſrael without a ſpirituall guide. The with-drawing of due meanes, is the way to the vtter deſolation of the Church; Rare offerings make cold Altars. There needed ſmall force to draw this Leuite to change his charge; Hold thy peace, and come, &amp; be our father, &amp; Prieſt; Whether is it better, &amp;c. Heere is not patience, but ioy; Hee that was won with tenne ſhekels, may be loſt with eleuen: When maintenance and honour calls him, he goes vndriuen; and rather ſteales himſelfe away, then is ſtoln. The Leuite had too many Gods, to make conſcience of pleaſing one: There is nothing more in cōſtant, then a Leuite that ſeekes nothing but himſelfe.
                     
                        
Thus the wilde fire of Idolatrie, which lay before couched in the priuate ball of Micha, now flies furiouſly through all the Tribe of Dan; who (like to Theeues that haue caried away plaguie clothes) haue inſenſibly infected thēſelues, and their poſteritie, to death: Hereſie and ſuperſtition haue ſmall beginnings, dangerous proceedings, pernicious cōcluſions. This contagion is like a canker, which at the firſt is ſcarce viſible; afterward it eates away the fleſh, and conſumes the body.

                        THere is no complaint of a publiquelie diſordered State, where a Leuite is not at one end of it; either as an agent, or a patient. In the Idolatry of Micha, and the Danites, a Leuite was an actor; In the violent vncleaneneſs of Gibeah, a

Leuite ſuffers; No Tribe ſhal ſooner feele the want of gouernment, then that of Leui.
                     The law of God allow'd the Leuite a wife; humane conniuence, a concubine; neither did the Iewiſh concubine differ from a wife, but in ſome outward complements; Both might challenge all the true eſſence of marriage; ſo little vvas the difference, that the father of the concubine, is called the father in law to the Leuite. She whom ill cuſtome had of a wife made a concubine, is now by her luſt, of a concubine made an harlot: Her fornication, together with the change of her bedde, hath changed her abode. Perhaps her owne conſcience thruſt her out of doores, perhaps

the iuſt ſeueritie of her huſband. Diſmiſsion was too eaſie a penalty for that which GOD had ſentenced with death: Shee that had deſeru'd to bee abhorred of her husband, ſeekes ſhelter from her father. Why would her father ſuffer his houſe to be defiled with an adultereſſe, tho out of his own loynes? VVhy did hee not rather ſay; VVhat? Dooſt thou looke to finde my houſe an harbour for thy ſinne? Whiles thou wert a wife to thine husband, thou wert a daughter to me; Now, thou art neither; Thou art not mine, I gaue thee to thy husband; Thou art not thy husbands, thou haſt betrayed his bed; Thy filthineſs hath made thee thine owne, and thine adulterers; Goe ſeeke thine entertainement,

where thou haſt loſt thine honeſtie; Thy lewdneſs hath brought a neceſsity of ſhame vpon thine abettors; How can I countenance thy perſon, and abandon thy ſin? I had rather be a iuſt man, then a kinde father; Get thee home therfore to thy husband, craue his forgiueneſs vpon thy knees, redeem his loue with thy modeſtie, and obedience; when his heart is once open to thee, my doores ſhall not be ſhut: In the meane time, know I can be no father to an harlot; Indulgence of Parents is the refuge of vanitie, the bande of wickedneſs, the bane of children. How eaſily is that Theefe induced to ſteale, that knowes his Receiuer: When the lawleſneſſe of youth knovves vvhere to finde pittie &amp;

toleration, vvhat miſchiefe can it forbeare?
                     By how much better this Leuite was, ſo much more iniurious was the concubines ſinne: What husband would not haue ſaid; She is gone, let ſhame and griefe goe with her, I ſhall finde one no leſs pleaſing, and more faithfull: Or if it be not too much mercy in me to yeeld to a returne, let her that hath offended, ſeeke mee; VVhat more direct way is there to a reſolued looſeneſſe, then to let her ſee I cannot want her? The good nature of this Leuite caſts off all theſe tearms; and now after 4 moneths abſence, ſends him to ſeek for her, that had runne away from her fidelitie: And now he thinks, She ſind

againſt me: perhaps ſhee hath repented; Perhaps, ſhame and feare haue with-held her from returning; Perhaps ſhee will be more loyall, for her ſinne; If her importunitie ſhould winne me, halfe the thanks were loſt; but now, my voluntarie offer of fauour ſhall oblige her for euer. Loue procures truer ſeruitude then neceſsitie: Mereie becomes well the heart of any man, but moſt of a Leuite. He that had helped to offer ſo manie ſacrifices to God for the multitude of euery Iſraelites ſinnes, ſaw how proportionable it was, that man ſhould not hold one ſinne vnpardonable: Hee had ſerued at the Altar to no purpoſe, if hee (whoſe trade was to ſue for mercie) had not at all learned to practice it.
                     
                        
And if the reflexion of mercie wrought this in a ſeruant, vvhat ſhall wee expect from him, whoſe eſſence is mercy? O God, wee doe euery day breake the holy couenant of our loue; Wee proſtitute our ſelues to euery filthy tentation, and then runne, and hide our ſelues in our fathers houſe, the world; If thou didſt not ſeeke vs vp, wee ſhould neuer returne; If thy gracious proffer did not preuent vs, wee ſhould be vncapable of forgiueneſs; It were abundant goodnes in thee to receiue vs, when we ſhold intreat thee: but lo, thou intreateſt vs that we wold receiue thee. How ſhould wee now adore, and imitate thy mercy, ſith there is more reaſon, wee ſhould ſue to each other, then that thou ſhouldſt

ſue to vs; becauſe we may as well offend, as be offended.
                     I doe not ſee the womans father make any meanes for reconciliation: but when remiſsion came home to his doores, no man could entertaine it more thankfully. The nature of many men is forward to accept, and negligent to ſue for; they can ſpend ſecret wiſhes vpon that, which ſhall coſt them no indeauour.
                     Great is the power of loue, which can in a ſort vndoe euills paſt, if not for the act, yet for the remembrance. Where true affection was once conceiued, it is eaſily peeced againe, after the ſtrongeſt interruption; Heere needs no tedious

recapitulation of wrongs, no importunitie of ſute; The vnkindneſſes are forgotten, their loue is renued; and now the Leuite is not a ſtranger, but a ſonne; By how much more willingly he came, by ſo much more vnwillingly hee is diſmiſſed. The foure moneths abſence of his daughter is anſwered with foure dayes feaſting; Neither was there ſo much ioy in the former wedding feaſt, as in this; becauſe then he deliuered his daughter intire; now, deſperate: then he found a ſonne; but now, that ſonne hath found his loſt daughter, and he found both: The recouerie of any good, is farre more pleaſant then the continuance.
                     
                        
Little doe we knowe what euill is towards vs; Now did this old man, and this reſtored couple promiſe themſelues all ioy, &amp; contentment after this vnkind ſtorm; and ſaid in themſelues, Now we begin to liue: And now this feaſt, which was meant for their new nuptialls, prooues her funerall. Euen when wee let our ſelues looſeſt to our pleaſures, the hand of God (thogh inuiſibly) is writing bitter things againſt vs: ſith we are not worthie to know, it is wiſedome to ſuſpect the worſt, whilſt it is leaſt ſeene.
                     Sometimes it falls out, that nothing is more iniurious then curreſie; If this old man had thruſt his ſonne and daughter early out of doores, they had auoyded this

miſchiefe; now, his louing importunity detaines them to their hurt, and his owne repentance. Such contentment doth ſincere affection find in the preſence of thoſe we loue, that death it ſelfe hath no other name, but departing; The greateſt comfort of our life, is the fruition of friendſhip, the diſſolution whereof, is the greateſt paine of death: As all earthly pleaſures, ſo this of loue, is diſtaſted with a neceſsitie of leauing. How worthy is that onely loue to take vp our harts, which is not open to any danger of interruption; which ſhall out-liue the date euen of faith and hope, and is as eternall, as that GOD, and thoſe bleſſed ſpirits whom we loue? If we hang neuer ſo importunately vpon one anothers

ſleeues, and ſhed floods of teares to ſtop their way, yet wee muſt be gone hence; no occaſion, no force, ſhall then remooue vs from our fathers houſe.
                     The Leuite is ſtayed beyond his time by importunitie; the motions whereof are boundleſſe, and infinite; one day drawes on another; neither is there any reaſon of this dayes ſtay, which may not ſerue ſtill for to morrow. His reſolution at laſt breaks throgh all thoſe kind hinderances; rather will hee venture a benighting, then an vnneceſſary delay. It is a good hearing that the Leuite makes haſte home; An honeſt mans heart is where his calling is; Such a one, when he is abroade, is like a fiſh in

the ayre; whereinto if it leape for recreation, or neceſsitie, yet it ſoone returns to his own element. This charge, by how much more ſacred it is, ſo much more attendance it expecteth; Euen a day breakes ſquare vvith the conſcionable.
                     The Sunne is ready to lodge before them; His ſeruant aduiſes him to ſhorten his iourney, holding it more fit to truſt an early In of the Iebuſites, then to the mercy of the night. And if that counſell had been followed, perhaps they, which found Iebuſites in Iſrael, might haue found Iſraelites in Iebus: No wiſe man can hold good counſell diſparaged, by the meaneneſſe of the author: If wee

be gladde to receiue any treaſure from our ſeruant, why not precious admonitions?
                     It was the zeale of this Leuite that ſhut him out of Iebus; We will not lodge in the City of ſtrangers. The Iebuſites were ſtrangers in religion, not ſtrangers enough in their habitation; The Leuite wil not receiue common curteſie from thoſe which were aliens frō God, though home-borne in the hart of Iſrael. It is lawfull enough in tearmes of ciuilitie to deale with Infidels; the earth is the Lords, and wee may enioy it in the right of the Owner, while we proteſt againſt the wrong of the Vſurper; yet the leſſe communion with Gods enemies, the more ſafety. If there were another

aire to breathe in from theirs, another earth to tread vpon, they ſhould haue their owne: Thoſe that affect a familiar intireneſſe with Iebuſites, in conuerſation, in leagues of amitie, in matrimoniall contracts, bewray either too much boldneſs, or too little conſcience.
                     Hee hath no bloud of an Iſraelite, that delights to lodge in Iebus: It was the fault of Iſrael, that an heatheniſh towne ſtood yet in the nauell of the Tribes, and that Iebus was no ſooner turn'd to Ieruſalem; Their lenitie and neglect, were guilty of this neighborhood, that now no man can paſſe from Bethleē Iuda, to mount Ephraim, but by the Citie of Iebuſites. Seaſonable iuſtice might preuent a

thouſand euills, which afterwards know no remedy but patience.
                     The way was not long betwixt Iebus and Gibeah: for the Sun was ſtooping when the Leuite was ouer againſt the firſt, &amp; is but now declined, whē he comes to the other. How his hart was lightned, when he was entred into an Iſraelitiſh Citie! and can thinke of nothing, but hoſpitalitie, reſt, ſecuritie. There is no perfume ſo ſweet to a Traueller, as his own ſmoake. Both expectation and feate, doe commonly diſappoint vs; for ſeldome euer do wee inioy the good we looke for, or ſmart with a feared euill. The poore Leuite could haue found but ſuch entertainement with the Iebuſites. Whither

are the poſteritie of Beniamin degenerated, that their Gibeah ſhold be no leſſe wicked then populous? The firſt ſigne of a ſettled godleſneſſe, is, that a Leuite is ſuffered to lie without doores. If God had been in any of their houſes, his ſeruant had not been excluded: Where no reſpect is giuē to Gods meſſengers, there can be no Religion.
                     
                        Gibeah was a ſecond Sodome; euē there alſo is another Lot: which is therefore ſo much more hoſpitall to ſtrangers, becauſe himſelfe was a ſtranger. The Hoſt as well as the Leuite is of mount Ephraim; Each man knows beſt to commiſerate that euil in others, which him ſelfe hath paſſed thorough; All

that profeſſe the Name of Chriſt, are Countrimen, and yet ſtrangers heere belowe; hovv cheerefully ſhould we entertaine each other, when we meet in the Gibeah of this inhoſpitall world?
                     This good old man of Gibeah, came home late from his work in the fields; the Sunne was ſette ere he gaue ouer; And now, ſeeing this man a ſtranger, an Iſraelite, a Leuite, an Ephraimite, and that in his way to the houſe of GOD, to take vp his lodging in the ſtreet, hee proffers him the kindneſs of his houſe-roome. Induſtrious ſpirits are the fitteſt receptacles of all good motions; whereas thoſe which giue themſelues to idle and looſe courſes, do not care ſo much as for themſelues. I heare of but

one man at his worke, in all Gibeah: the reſt were quaffing and reuelling. That one man ends his worke in a charitable entertainement; the other, end their play in a brutiſh beaſtlineſſe, &amp; violence. Theſe villaines had learn'd both the actions, and the language of the Sodomites; One vncleane diuell was the prompter to both: &amp; this honeſt Ephraimite, had learnt of righteous Lot, both to intreat, and to proffer. As a perplexed Mariner, that in a ſtorme muſt caſt away ſomething, although precious; ſo this good Hoſt, rather will proſtitute his daughter, a virgin, together with the concubine, then this prodigious villany ſhould be offered to a man, much more to a man of God.
                     
                        
The deteſtation of a foule ſinne drew him to ouer-reach in the motion of a leſſer; which if it had been accepted, how could he have eſcaped the partnerſhip of their vncleaneneſſe, and the guilt of his daughters rauiſhment? No man can waſh his hands of that ſinne, to which his will hath yeelded. Bodily violence may be inoffenſiue in the patient; voluntary inclination to euill (tho out of feare) can neuer be excuſable: yet behold this wickedneſſe is too little to ſatisfie theſe monſters.
                     Who would haue looked for ſo extreame abhomination from the loynes of Iacob, the wombe of Rachel, the ſons of Beniamin? Could the very Iebuſites their neighbors

be euer accuſed of ſuch vnnaturall outrage? I am aſhamed to ſay it, Euen the worſt Pagans vvere Saints, to Iſrael. VVhat auailes it that they haue the Arke of GOD in Shiloh, while they haue. Sodom in their ſtreets? that the law of God is in their ſringes, whiles the diuell is in their harts? Nothing but hell it ſelfe can yeeld a worſe creature then a depraued Iſraelite; the very meanes of his reformation, are the fuell of his wickednes.
                     Yet Lot ſped ſo much better in Sodom, then this Ephraimite did in Gibeah, by how much more holy gueſts hee entertained. There the gueſts were Angels; here a ſinfull man. There the gueſts ſaued the hoſt; heere the hoſt could not

ſaue the gueſt from brutiſh violence; Thoſe Sodomites vvere ſtriken with outward blindnes and defeated; Theſe Beniamites are onely blinded with luſt, and preuaile. The Leuite comes forth, perhaps his coat ſaued his perſon from this villany; who now thinks himſelfe well, that hee may haue leaue to redeeme his owne dishonour with his concubines. If hee had not loued her deerely, he had neuer ſought her ſo farre, after ſo foule a ſinne; Yet now his hate of that vnnaturall wickedneſſe ouercame his loue to her; She is expoſed to the furious luſt of barbarous ruffians, and (which hee miſdoubted not) abuſed to death.
                     
                        
Oh the iuſt and euen courſe which the Almightie Iudge of the world holds in all his retributions! This woman had ſhamed the bed of a Leuite, by her former wantonneſſe; ſhee had thus farre gone ſmoothly away with her ſinne; her father harbourd her, her husband forgaue her, her owne hart found no cauſe to complaine, becauſe ſhee ſmarted not: now, vvhen the world had forgotten her offence, GOD calls her to reckoning and puniſhes her with her owne ſinne. She had voluntarily expoſed herſelfe to luſt; now is expoſed forceably. Adultery was her ſinne, adultery was her death. VVhat ſmiles ſoeuer wickedneſs caſts vpon the heart, vvhiles it ſolicites; it vvill owe vs a diſpleaſure, and

prooue it ſelfe a faithfull Debter.
                     The Leuite looked to find her humbled with this violence, not murdered; and now, indignation moues him to adde horror to the fact: Had not his heart been raiſed vp with an exceſs of deſire to make the crime as odious, as it was ſinfull, his action could not be excuſed. Thoſe hands that might not touch a carcaſs, now carue the corps of his owne dead wife, into morſels; and ſend theſe tokens to all the Tribes of Iſrael; that when they ſhould ſee theſe gobbets of the body murdered, the more they might deteſt the murderers. Himſelfe puts on cruelty to the dead, that hee might draw them to a iuſt

reuenge of her death; Actions notoriouſly vilanous, may iuſtlie countenance an extraordinarie meanes of proſecution: Euery Iſraelite hath part in a Leuits wrong; No Tribe hath not his ſhare in the carcaſſe, and the reuenge.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                     The Deſolation of Beniamin.
                     
                        THeſe morſels could not chuſe but cut the harts of Iſrael with horror, and compaſsion; horror of the act, and compaſsion of the ſufferer: and now their zeale drawes them together, either for ſatisfaction, or reuenge. VVho would not haue looked that the hands of Beniamin ſhould haue been firſt vpon Gibeah; and that they ſhould haue readily ſent the heads of the offenders, for a ſecond ſeruice after the gobbets of

the concubine: But now, inſteed of puniſhing the ſinne, they patronize the actors; and will rather die in reſiſting iuſtice, then liue and proſper in furthering it.
                     Surely, Iſrael had one Tribe too many: all Beniamin is turned into Gibeah, the ſonnes not of Beniamin, but of Belial. The abetting of euill, is worſe then the commiſsion; This may bee vpon infirmitie, but that muſt be vpon reſolution: Eaſie puniſhment is too much fauour to ſinne: conniuence is much worſe: but the defence of it (and that vnto bloud) is intollerable. Had not theſe men been both wicked, and quarrellous, they had not drawne their ſwords in ſo foule a cauſe. Peaceable

diſpoſitions are hardly drawne to fight for innocence: yet theſe Beniaminites (as if they were in loue with villany, and out of charitie with GOD) will be the wilfull. Champions of lewdneſs. How can Gibeah repent them of that wickedneſſe, which all Beniamin will make good; in ſpight of their conſciences? Euen where ſinne is ſuppreſſed, it will riſe; but, where it is incouraged, it inſults &amp; tyrannizes.
                     It was more iuſt that Iſrael ſhold riſe againſt Beniamin, then that Beniamin ſhould riſe for Gibeah; by how much it is better to puniſh offenders, then to ſhelter the offenders from puniſhing; And yet the wickedneſs of Beniamin,

ſped better for the time, then the honeſtie of Iſrael; Twiſe was the better part foyled by the leſſe, and worſe; The good cauſe vvas ſent backe with ſhame: the euill returned with victory, and triumph. O GOD! their hand was for thee in the fight, and thy hand was with them in their fall; They had not fought for thee, but by thee; neither could they haue miſcarried in the fight, if thou hadſt not fought againſt them; Thou art iuſt &amp; holy in both. The cauſe was thine: the ſinne in managing of it, vvas their owne; They fought in an holy quarrell, but with confidence in themſelues; for, as preſuming of victorie, they aske of GOD, not what ſhould be their ſucceſs, but who ſhould be their Captaine.

Number &amp; innocence made them too ſecure; It was iuſt therefore with GOD, to let them feele, that euen good zeale cannot beare out preſumption: And that victory lyes not in the cauſe, but in the God that ownes it.
                     VVho cannot imagine hovv much the Beniaminites inſulted in their double field, and day? And now beganne to think, God was on their ſide; Thoſe ſwords which had bin taught the way into fortie thouſand bodies of their brethren, cannot feare a new incounter. Wicked men cannot ſee their proſperity a peece of their curſe, neither can examine their actions, but the euents: Soone after, they ſhall finde what it was

to adde bloud vnto filthineſſe, and that the victory of an euill cauſe, is the way to ruine and confuſion.
                     I ſhould haue feared leaſt this double diſcomfiture ſhould haue made Iſrael, either diſtruſtfull, or weary of a good cauſe: but ſtill I finde them no leſſe courageous, with more humilitie. Now they faſt, &amp; weepe, and ſacrifice; theſe weapons had been victorious in their firſt aſſault; Beniamin had neuer been in danger of pride for ouer comming, if this humiliation of Iſrael had preuented the fight. It is ſildom ſeen, but that which we do with feare, proſpereth; wheras confidence in vndertaking, layes euen good indeauours in the duſt.
                     
                        
Wickedneſſe could neuer brag of any long proſperitie; nor complaine of the lacke of payment: Still GOD is euen with it at the laſt; Now hee payes the Beniaminites both that death which they had lent to the Iſraelites, and that wherein they ſtood indebted to their brotherhood of Gibeah: And novv that both are metre in death, there is as much difference betwixt thoſe Iſraelites, and theſe Beniaminites, as betwixt Martyrs, and malefactors: To die in a ſinne is a fearefull reuenge of giuing patronage to ſinne; The ſword conſumes their bodies, another fire their Cities, vvhat-ſoeuer became of their ſoules.
                     
                        
Now might Rachel haue iuſtlie wept for her childrē, becauſe they were not; For, behold the men, women, and children of her wicked Tribe, are cut off; onely ſome few ſcattred remainders, ran away from this vengeance, and lurked in caues, and rocks, both for fear, and ſhame; There was no difference, but life, betwixt their brethren and them; the earth couered them both: yet vnto them, doth the reuenge of Iſrael ſtretch it ſelf▪ and vowes to deſtroy, if not their perſons, yet their ſucceſsion; as holding them vnwoorthy to receiue any comfort by that ſexe, to which they had bin ſo cruell, both in act, and maintenance. If the Iſraelites had not held marriage &amp; iſſue a very great bleſsing, they

had not thus reuenged themſelues of Beniamin; Now they accounted the vvith-holding of their wiues, a puniſhment ſecond to death: The hope of life in our poſteritie, is the next contentment to an inioying of life in our ſelues.
                     They haue ſworn, and now vpon cold bloud repent them. If the oath were not iuſt, why wold they take it? and if it were iuſt, why did they recant it? If the act were luſtifiable, what needed theſe tears? Euen a iuſt oath may be raſhly taken: not onely iniuſtice, but temerity of ſwearing ends, in lamentation. In our very ciuill actions, it is a weaknes, to do that which we would after reuerſe; but in our affaires with GOD, to check our

ſelues too late, and to ſteepe our oathes in teares, is a dangerous folly; He doth not commaund vs to take voluntary oathes; he commaunds vs to keepe them. If wee bind our ſelues to inconuenience, we may iuſtly cōplain of our owne fetters: Oaths doe not onely require iuſtice, but iudgment; wiſe deliberation, no leſſe then equity.
                     Not conſcience of their fact, but commiſeration of their brethren, led them to this publique repentance. O God, why is this come to paſs, that this day one Tribe of Iſrael ſhall want? Euen the iuſteſt reuenge of men is capable of pittie; Inſultation in the rigor of iuſtice, argues crueltie; Charitable mindes are grieued to ſee that

done, which they would not wiſh vndone; the ſmart of the offender doth not pleaſe thē, which yet are throughly diſpleaſed with the ſin, and haue giuen their hands to puniſh it. GOD himſelfe takes no pleaſure in the death of a ſinner, yet loues the puniſhment of ſin: As a good Parent whips his child, yet weepes himſelfe; There is a meaſure in victorie, and reuenge, if neuer ſo iuſt; which to exceed, leeſes mercie in the ſute of Iuſtice.
                     If there were no fault in their ſeueritie, it needed no excuſe; and if there were a fault, it will admitte of no excuſe: yet, as if they meant to ſhift off the ſinne, they expoſtulate with God; O Lord God of

Iſrael, why is this come to paſſe this day? GOD gaue them no commaund of this rigour; yea he twiſe croſt them in the execution; and now, in that which they intreated of God with teares, they challenge him. It is a dangerous iniuſtice to lay the burden of our ſinnes vpon him, which tempteth no man, nor can be tempted with euill; whiles we would ſo remooue our ſinne, we double it.
                     A man that knew not the power of an oath, wold wonder at this contrarietie in the affections of Iſrael; They are ſory for the ſlaughter of Beniamin, and yet they ſlay thoſe that did not helpe them in the ſlaughter. Their oath calls them to more bloud; The

exceſs of their reuenge vpon Beniamin, may not excuſe the men of Gilead; If euer oath might looke for a diſpenſation, this might plead it; Now, they dare not but kill the men of Iabeſh Gilead, leaſt they ſhould haue left vpon themſelues a greater ſin of ſparing, then puniſhing. Iabeſh Gilead came not vp to ayde Iſrael, therefore all the inhabitants muſt die. To exempt our ſelues (whether out of ſingularitie, or ſtubbornneſs) from the common actions of the Church, when wee are lawfully called to them, is an offence woorthy of iudgement: In the maine quarrels of the Church, neutralls are puniſhed. This execution ſhal make amends for the former; of the ſpoile of Iabeſh Gilead, ſhall the Beniaminites

be ſtored with wiues: that no man may think theſe men ſlain for their daughters, they plainlie die for their ſin; and theſe Gileadites might not haue liued, without the periury of Iſrael: and now, ſith they muſt die, it is good to make benefit of neceſsity. I inquire not into the rigour of the oath; If their ſolemn vow did not bind them to kill all of both ſexes in Beniamin, why did they not ſpare their virgins? and if it did ſo binde them, why did they ſpare the virgins of Gilead? Fauors muſt bee inlarged in all theſe religious reſtrictions; where breath may be taken in them, it is not fit nor ſafe they ſhould be ſtrainted.
                     
                        
Foure-hundred virgins of Gilead haue loſt parents, and brethren, and kindred, and now finde husbands in lieu of them. An inforced marriage, was but a miſerable comfort for ſuch a loſſe: like wards, or captiues they are taken, and chuſe not. Theſe ſuffice not, their friendly aduerſaries conſult for more, vpon worſe conditions. Into what troubleſome and dangerous ſtraits do men thruſt themſelues, by either vniuſt, or inconſiderate vowes?
                     In the midſt of all this common lawleſnes of Iſrael, here was conſcience made on both ſides, of matching with Infidels; The Iſraelites can rather be content their daughters ſhould be ſtoln by their

own, then that the daughters of aliens ſhould be giuen them. Theſe men which had not grace enough to deteſt &amp; puniſh the beaſtlineſs of their Gileadites, yet are not ſo graceleſs, as to chuſe them wiues of the Heathen: All but Atheiſts (howſoeuer they let themſelues looſe) yet in ſome things, find thē
                        ſelues reſtrained, and ſhow to others that they haue a conſcience. If there were not much danger, &amp; much ſinne in this vnequall yoke, they would neuer haue perſwaded to ſo heauy an inconuenience; Diſparitie of religion in matrimoniall contracts, hath ſo many miſchiefes, that it is worthy to be redeemed with much preiudice.
                     
                        
They which might not giue their own daughters to Beniamin, yet giue others, whiles they giue leaue to ſteale them. Stoln marriages, are both vnnaturall, and ful of hazard; for loue (whereof marriage is the knot) cannot be forced: this was rather rape, then wedlocke. What vnlikeneſs (perhaps contrarietie) of diſpoſition, what auerſeneſſe of affection, may there be in not onely a ſudden, but a forceable meeting? If theſe Beniaminites had not taken libertie of giuing themſelues eaſe by diuorcement, they would often haue found leaſure to rue this ſtoln booty. This act may not bee drawn to example; and yet here was a kind of indefinite conſent; Both deliberation, and good liking, are little enough

for a during eſtate, &amp; that which is once done for euer.
                     Theſe virgins come vp to the feaſt of the Lord; and now, out of the midſt of their daunces are carried to a double captiuitie. How many virgins haue loſt themſelues in daunces? and yet this ſport was not immodeſt. Theſe virgins danced by themſelues, without the company of them vvhich might moue towards vnchaſtity; for if any men had bin with thē, they had found ſo many reſcuers, as they had aſſaulters; now, the expoſing of their weake ſex to this iniurie, prooues their innocence. Our vſuall daunces are guilty of more ſin; Wanton geſtures, &amp; vnchaſt touches, lookes, motions, drawe the

hart to folly; The ambuſhes of euill ſpirits, carry away manie a ſoule from daunces, to a fearefull deſolation.
                     It is ſuppoſed, that the Parents thus robbed of their daughters, will take it heauily: There cannot be a greater croſſe, then the miſcarriage of children; They are not onely the liuing goods, but peeces of their Parents; that they ſhould therefore bee torne from them by violence, is no leſſe iniury, then the diſmembring of their owne bodies.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        Naomi and Ruth.
                     
                     
                        BEtwixt the raigne of the Iudges, Iſrael was plagued with tyrannie; and whiles ſome of them raigned, with famine; Seldome did that rebellious people want ſomewhat to humble them; One rod is not enough for a ſtubborne childe: The famine muſt needs be great, that makes the inhabitants to runne their country; The name of home is ſo ſweet, that we cannot leaue it for a little; Behold that

Land, which had wont to flow with milke and honie, now abounds with want and penurie, and Bethleem in ſtead of an houſe of bread, is an houſe of famine; A fruitfull land doth God make barren, for the wickedneſſe of them, that dwell therein; The earth beares not for it ſelfe, but for vs; God is not angry with it, but with men; For our ſakes, it was firſt curſed to thornes and thiſtles, after that, to moiſture, and ſince that (not ſeldome) to drought; and by all theſe to barrenneſſe. Wee may not looke alwaies for plenty; It is a wonder whiles there is ſuch ſuperfluitie of wickednes, that our earth is no more ſparing of her fruits.
                     
                        
The whole earth is the Lords, and in him, ours; It is lawfull for the owners to change their houſes, at pleaſure; Why ſhould we not make free vſe of any part of our owne poſſeſsions? Elimelech and his familie remoue from Bethleem Iuda vnto Moab; Nothing but neceſsitie can diſpenſe with a locall relinquiſhing of Gods Church; Not pleaſure, not profit, not curioſitie; Thoſe which are famiſhed out, God calls, yea driues from thence. The creator and poſſeſſor of the earth, hath not confined any man to his neceſſarie deſtruction.
                     It was lawfull for Elimelech to make vſe of Pagans, and Idolaters,

for the ſupply of all needfull helps; There cannot be a better imployment of Moabites, then to be the treaſurers and purueyours of Gods children; Wherefore ſerue they but to gather for the true owners? It is too much niceneſſe in them, which forbeare the benefit they might make of the faculties of profane, or hereticall perſons; They conſider not that they haue more right to the good ſuch men can doe, then they that doe it, and challenge that good for their owne.
                     But I cannot ſee, how it could be lawful for his Sonnes to match with the daughters of Moab; Had theſe men heard how farre,

and vnder how ſolemne an oath, their father Abraham ſent for a wife of his owne tribe, for his ſon Iſaac? Had they heard the earneſt charge of holy Iſaac, to the ſonne he bleſſed, Thou ſhalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan? Had they forgotten the plagues of Iſrael for but a ſhort conuerſation with the Moabitiſh women? If they plead remoteneſſe from their owne people; Did they not remember how farre Iacob walked to Padan-Aram? Was it further from Moab to Bethleem, then from Bethleem to Moab? and if the care of themſelues led them from Bethleem to Moab; ſhould not their care of obedience to God haue as wel carried thē back

from Moab to Bethleem? Yet if their wiues would have left their Idolatrie with their maiden-head, the match had been more ſafe; but now, euen at the laſt farewell, Naomi can ſay of Orpah, that ſhe is returned to her gods. Theſe men haue ſinned in their choice, and it ſpeeds with them accordingly: Where did euer one of theſe vnequall matches proſper? The two ſonnes of Elimelech are ſwept away childleſſe in the prime of their age, and in ſteed of their ſeed they leaue their carcaſſes in Moab; their wiues widdowes, their mother childleſſe, and helpleſſe amongſt Infidels, in that age which moſt needed comfort. How miſerable doe we now finde poore

                        Naomi? which is left deſtitute of her country, her husband, her children, her friends; and turned looſe, and ſolitarie to the mercie of the world: Yet euen out of theſe hopeleſſe ruines, will God raiſe comfort to his ſeruant. The firſt good newes is, that God hath viſited his people with bread; now therefore, ſince her husband and ſonnes were vnrecouerable, ſhe will try to recouer her country, and kinred; If wee can haue the ſame conditions in Iudah, that we haue in Moab, we are no Iſraelites▪ if wee returne not; Whiles her husband and ſonnes liued, I heare no motion of retiring home, now theſe her earthly ſtayes are remoued, ſhee thinks

preſently of remouing to her country; Neither can we ſo hartily thinke of our home aboue, whiles wee are furniſhed with theſe worldly contentments; when God ſtrips vs of them, ſtraight-waies our mind is homeward.
                     She that came from Bethleem, vnder the protection of an huſband, attended with her ſonnes, ſtored with ſubſtance; reſolues now to meaſure all that way alone: Her aduerſitie had ſtript her of all, but a good heart; that remaines with her, and beares vp her head, in the deepeſt of her extremitie: True Chriſtian fortitude wades through all euills;

and, tho we be vp to the chin, yet keepes firme footing againſt the ſtreame: where this is, the ſexe is not diſcerned; neither is the quantitie of the euill read in the face; How well doth this courage become Iſraelites, when wee are left comfortleſſe in the midſt of the Moab of this world, to reſolue the contempt of all dangers, in the way to our home; As contrarily, nothing doth more miſbeſeeme a Chriſtian, then that his ſpirits ſhould flagge with his eſtate, and that any difficultie ſhould make him diſpaire of attayning his beſt ends.
                     Goodnes is of a winning quality whereſoeuer it is; and euen amongſt Infidels, will make it

ſelfe friends; The good diſpoſition of Naomi carries away the hearts of her daughters in law with her; ſo as they are ready to forſake their kinred, their countrey, yea their owne mother, for a ſtranger, whoſe affinity died with her ſons: Thoſe men are worſe then Infidels, and next to Diuels that hate the vertues of Gods Saints; and could loue their perſons well if they were not conſcionable.
                     How earneſtly doe theſe two daughters of Moab plead for their continuance with Naomi; and how hardly is either of them diſſwaded from partaking of the miſerie of her ſociety; there are

good natures euen among Infidels, and ſuch as for morall diſpoſition, and ciuill reſpects cannot be exceeded by the beſt profeſſors: Who can ſuffer his heart to reſt in thoſe qualities, which are common to them that are without God?
                     
                        Naomi could not be ſo inſenſible of her owne good, as not to know how much comfort ſhee might reape to the ſo litarineſſe, both of her voyage, and her widdowhood, by the ſociety of theſe two yonger widdowes, whoſe affections ſhe had ſo well tried; even very partnerſhip is a mitigation of euils; yet ſo earneſtly doth ſhe diſſwade from accompanying

her, as that ſhe could not haue ſaid more, if ſhe had thought their preſence irkeſome, and burdenous: Good diſpoſitions loue not to pleaſure themſelues with the diſaduantage of others; and had rather be miſerable alone, then to draw in partners to their ſorrow; for the ſight of anothers calamity doth rather double their owne; and if themſelues were free, would affect them with compaſſion; As contrarilie, ill mindes care not how many companions they haue in miſerie, nor how few conſorts in good; If themſelues miſ-carry, they could be content all the world were enwrapped with them in the ſame diſtreſſe.
                     
                        
I maruell not that Orpah is by this ſeaſonable importunity perſwaded to returne; from a mother in law, to a mother in nature; from a toyleſome iourney to reſt, from ſtrangers to her kinred, from an hopeleſſe condition, to likelihoods of contentment. A little intreaty will ſerue to mooue nature to be good vnto it ſelfe: Euery one is rather a Naomi to his owne ſoule, to perſwade it to ſtay ſtill, and inioy the delights of Moab, rather then to hazard our entertainment in Bethleem: Will religion allow me this wilde libertie of my actions, this looſe mirth, theſe carnal pleaſures? Can I be a Chriſtian, and not liue ſullenly? None but a regenerate

heart can chooſe rather to ſuffer aduerſity with Gods people, then to inioy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon.
                     The one ſiſter takes an vnwilling farwell, and moiſtens her laſt kiſſes with many teares; the other cannot be driuen back but repells one intreatie, with another; Intreat me not to leaue thee; for whither thou goeſt, I will go; where thou dwelleſt I will dwell, thy people ſhall be my people, thy God my God, where thou dieſt I will die, and there will I be buried; Ruth ſaw ſo much vpon ten yeares tryall, in Naomi, as was more worth then all Moab; and in compariſon whereof, all worldly reſpects deſerued nothing but contempt:

The next degree vnto goodneſſe is the loue of goodneſſe: He is in a faire way to grace, that can value it; If ſhe had not been already a proſelite, ſhe could not haue ſet this price vpon Naomies vertue. Loue cannot be ſeperated from a deſire of fruition; In vaine had Ruth proteſted her affection to Naomi, if ſhe could haue turned her out to her iourney alone; Loue to the ſaints doth not more argue our intereſt in God, then ſocietie argues the truth of our loue.
                     As ſome tight veſſell that holds out againſt winde and water, ſo did Ruth againſt all the powers of a mothers perſwaſions; The

impoſſibilitie of the comfort of marriage in following her (which drew backe her ſiſter in law) cannot moue her; She heares her mother, like a modeſt matrone (contrary to the faſhion of theſe times) ſay, I am too old to haue an husband, and yet ſhe thinkes not on the contrary, I am too young to want an husband: It ſhould ſeeme the Moabites had learned this faſhion of Iſrael to expect the brothers raiſing of ſeed to the deceaſed; The widdowhood and age of Naomi cuts off that hope; neither could Ruth then, dreame of a Boaz that might aduance her; It is no loue that cannot make vs willing to be miſerable for thoſe we affect; The

holloweſt heart can be content to follow one that proſpereth: Aduerſity is the onely furnace of friendſhip; If loue vvill not abide both fire and anuile, it is but counterfeit; ſo in our loue to God vve doe but crack and vaunt in vaine if we cannot be willing to ſuffer for him.
                     But if any motiue might hope to ſpeed, that which was drawne from example, was moſt likely; Behold thy ſiſter in law, is gone backe vnto her people, and to her Gods; returne thou after her: This one art-leſſe perſwaſion hath preuailed more with the world, then all the places of reaſon: How many millions miſcarry

vpon this ground; Thus did my fore-fathers; Thus doe the moſt; I am neither the firſt, nor the laſt; Doe any of the rulers; We ſtraight thinke that, either ſafe, or pardonable, for which we can plead a precedent. This good woman hath more warrant for her reſolution, then anothers practiſe; The minde can neuer be ſteddy, whiles it ſtandes vpon others feet, and till it be ſetled vpon ſuch grounds of aſſurance, that it will rather lead, then follow; and can ſay with Ioſhua, whatſoeuer become of the world, I and my houſe will ſerue the Lord.
                     
                     If Naomi had not been a perſon of eminent note; no knowledge

had been taken at Bethleem, of her returne; Pouerty is euer obſcure; and thoſe that haue little, may go and come without noiſe: If the ſtreets of Bethleem had not before vſed to ſay, There goes Naomi; they had not now asked, Is not this Naomi? She that had loſt all things, but her name, is willing to part with that alſo; Call mee not Naomi, but call me Marah; Her humility cares little for a glorious name, in a deiected eſtate; Many a one would haue ſet faces vpon their want, and in the bitterneſſe of their condition, haue affected the name of beauty; In all formes of good, there are more that care to ſeeme, then to be; Naomi hates this hypocriſie, and ſince

God hath humbled her, deſires not to bee reſpected of men: Thoſe which are truely brought downe, make it not daintie, that the world ſhould thinke them ſo; but are ready to bee the firſt proclaimers of their owne vileneſſe.
                     
                        Naomi went full out of Bethleem to preuent want; and now ſhee brings that want home with her, which ſhee deſired to auoide: Our blindneſſe oft times carries vs into the perills wee ſeeke to eſchew; God finds it beſt many times to croſſe the likely proiects of his deareſt children; and to multiply thoſe afflictions, which they feared ſingle.
                     
                        
Ten yeares haue turned Naomi into Marah; what aſſurance is there of theſe earthly thinges, whereof one houre may ſtrip vs? What man can ſay of the yeares to come, Thus I will be? How iuſtly doe we contemne this vncertainty, and looke vp to thoſe riches that cannot but indure, when heauen and earth are diſſolued?
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        Boaz and Ruth.
                     
                     
                        WHiles Elimelech ſhifted to Moab to auoide the famine; Boaz abode ſtill at Bethleem, and continued rich, and powerfull; He ſtaide at home, and found that, which Elimelech went to ſeeke, and miſſed: The iudgement of ſamme doth not lightly extend it ſelfe to all; Peſtilence and the ſword ſpare none; but dearth commonly plagueth the meaner ſort, and balketh the mightie; When Boaz his ſtore-houſe

was emptie, his fieldes were full; and maintaine the name of Bethleem.
                     
                     I do not heare Ruth ſtand vpon the termes of her better education, or wealthy Parentage, but now that God hath called her to want, ſhe ſcornes not to lay her hand vnto all homely ſeruices; and thinkes it no diſparagement to finde her bread in other mens fields; There is no harder leſſon to a generous minde, nor that more beſeemes it, then either to beare want, or to preuent it; Baſe ſpirits giue themſelues ouer to idleneſſe, and miſerie, and becauſe they are croſſed, will ſullenly periſh.
                     
                        
That good woman hath not been for nothing in the ſchoole of patience; ſhee hath learned obedience to a poore ſtepmother; ſhee was now a widdow, paſt he reach of any danger of correction, beſides, that penurie might ſeeme to diſpenſe with awe▪ Euen children doe eaſily learne to contemne the pouertie of their owne Parents; Yet hath ſhee ſo inured her ſelfe to obedience, that ſhee will not ſo much as goe forth into the field to gleane, without the leaue of her mother in law, and is no leſſe obſequious to March, then ſhee was to Naomi; What ſhall wee ſay to thoſe children, that in the maine actions of their life, forget they haue naturall Parents:

It is a ſhame to ſee that in meane families want of ſubſtance cauſeth want of dutie; and that children ſhould thinke themſelus priuiledged for vnreuerence, becauſe the Parent is poore.
                     Little do we know, when wee goe forth in the morning, what God meanes to doe with vs ere night; There is a prouidence that attends on vs in all our waies; and guides vs inſenſibly to his owne ends; That diuine hand leads Ruth blindfolded to the field of Boaz: That ſhee meets with his reapers, and falls vpon his land amongſt all the fields of Bethleem, it was no praiſe to her election, but the gracious diſpoſition

of him, in whom wee mooue; His thoughts are aboue ours; and do ſo order our actions, as we, if wee had knowne, ſhould haue wiſhed.
                     No ſooner is ſhe come into the field, but the reapers are friendly to her; no ſooner is Boaz come into his field, but he inuites her to more bountie then ſhee could haue deſired; now God begins to repay into her boſome, her loue and dutie to her mother in law; Reuerence and louing reſpects to Parents, neuer yet went away vnrecompenced; God will ſurely raiſe vp friends amongſt ſtrangers, to thoſe that haue been officious at home.
                     
                        
It was worth Ruthes iourney from Moab, to meet with ſuch a man as Boaz, whom wee finde thriftie, religious, charitable; Tho he were rich yet he was not careleſſe; hee comes into the field to ouerſee his reapers; Euen the beſt eſtate requires carefull menaging of the owner; He wanted not officers to take charge of his huſbandrie, yet he had rather be his owne witneſſe: After all the truſt of others, the Maſters eye feeds the horſe: The Maſter of this great houſhold of the world giues vs an example of this care, whoſe eye is in euery corner of this his large poſſeſſion; Not ciuilitie only, but religion binde vs to good husbandrie; We are all

ſtewards, and what account can we giue to our maſter, if we neuer looke after our eſtate? I doubt whether Boaz had been ſo rich, if he had not been ſo frugall: Yet was he not more thriftie, then religious: He comes not to his reapers, but with a bleſſing in his mouth: The Lord be with you, as one that knew, if hee were with them, and not the Lord, his preſence could auaile nothing; All the buſineſſe of the familie ſpeeds the better, for the maſters benediction; Thoſe affaires are likely to ſucceed, that take their beginning at God.
                     Charitie was well matched with his religion; without which, good

words, are but hypocrites; no ſooner doth hee heare the name of the Moabiteſſe, but he ſeconds the kindnes of his reapers; and ſtill he riſes in his fauours▪ Firſt, ſhe may gleane in his field; then ſhee may drinke of his veſſells; then, ſhee ſhall take her meale with his reapers; and part of it, from his owne hand; Laſtly, his worke-men muſt let fall ſheaues for her gathering: A ſmall thing helps the needie: an handfull of gleanings, a lap-full of parched corne, a draught of the ſeruants bottles, a looſe ſheafe was ſuch a fauour to Ruth, as ſhe thought was aboue all recompence; This was not ſeene in the eſtate of Boaz, which yet makes her

for the time, happy. If we may refreſh the ſoule of the poore with the very offalls of our eſtate, and not hurt our ſelues, woe be to vs if we doe it not; Our barnes ſhall bee as full of curſes as of corne, if we grudge the ſcattered eares of our field to the hands of the needie.
                     How thankfully doth Ruth take theſe ſmall fauours from Boaz: perhaps ſome rich Iewell in Moab would not haue been ſo welcome; Euen this was a preſage of her better eſtate; thoſe which ſhall receiue great bleſſings, are euer thankfull for little; and if poore ſoules be ſo thankfull to vs, for but an handfull, or a

ſheafe; how ſhould we be affected to our God, for whoſe fieldsfull, for full barnes, full garners?
                     Doubtleſſe, Boaz, hauing taken notice of the good nature, dutifull cariage, and the neere affinitie of Ruth, could not but purpoſe ſome greater beneficence, and higher reſpects to her; Yet now onwards he fits his kindnes to her condition, and giues her that, which to her meaneneſſe ſeemed much, tho he thought it little: Thus doth the bountie of our God deale with vs; It is not for want of loue, that he giues vs no greater meaſure of grace, but for want of our fitneſſe and capacitie; Hee hath reſerued greater

preferments for vs, when it ſhall bee ſeaſonable for vs to receiue them.
                     
                        Ruth returnes home wealthy with her Ephah of barley, and thankfully magnifies the liberalitie of Boaz, her new benefactor: Naomi repayes his beneficence with her bleſſing; Bleſſed be he of the Lord. If the rich can exchange their almes with the poore for bleſſings, they haue no cauſe to complaine of an ill bargaine Our gifts cannot be worth their faithfull prayers: Therefore it is better to giue then to receiue, becauſe he that receiues, hath but a worthleſſe almes, hee that giues, receiues an vnualuable bleſſing.
                     
                        
I cannot but admire the modeſtie and ſilence of theſe two women; Naomi had not ſo much as talked of her kinred in Bethleem, nor till now, had ſhee told Ruth that ſhe had a wealthy kinſman; neither had Ruth inquired of her husbands great alliance; but both ſate downe meekly with their owne wants, and cared not to know any thing elſe ſaue that themſelues were poore: Humilitie is euer the way to honor.
                     It is a diſcurteſie where we are beholden, to alter our dependencie; Like as men of trade take it ill, if cuſtomers which are in their bookes, goe for their wares to another ſhop; Wiſely

doth Naomi aduiſe Ruth not to bee ſeene in any other field, whiles the harueſt laſted. The very taking of their fauours is a contentment to thoſe that haue already well deſerued; and it is quarrell enough that their curteſie is not receiued; How ſhall the God of heauen take it, that whiles he giues and proffers largely, wee runne to the world that can afford vs nothing but vanitie and vexation?
                     Thoſe that can leaſt act, are oft-times the beſt to aduiſe: Good old Naomi ſits ſtill at home, and by her counſell payes Ruth all the loue ſhee owes her. The face of that action, to which

ſhee directs her, is the worſt peece of it; the heart was ſound; Perhaps, the aſſurance, which long tryall had giuen her of the good gouernment, and firme chaſtitie of her daughter in law, together with her perſwaſion of the religious grauitie of Boaz, made her thinke that deſigne ſafe, which to others had been perilous, if not deſperate; But beſides that, holding Boaz next of blood to Elimelech, ſhee made account of him, as the lawfull husband of Ruth; ſo as there wanted nothing but a challenge, and conſummation; Nothing was abated but ſome outward ſolemnities, which (tho expedient for the ſatisfaction of others)

yet were not eſſentiall to marriage: And if there were not theſe colours for a proiect ſo ſuſpicious, it would not follow, that the action were warrantable, becauſe Naomies: Why ſhould her example be more ſafe in this then in matching her ſonues with Inſidels; then in ſending backe Orpah to her fathers Gods? If euery act of an holy perſon ſhould bee our rule, wee ſhould haue crooked liues: Euery action that is reported, is not ſtraight-waies allowed; Our courſes were very vncertaine, if God had not giuen vs rules, whereby wee may examine the examples of the beſt Saints, and as well cenſure, as follow them. Let them that ſtumble

at the boldnes of Ruth, imitate the continence of Boaz.
                     
                     Theſe times were not delicate; This man (though great in Bethleem) laies him downe to reſt vpon a pallet, in the floore of his barne; when hee awakes at midnight, no maruell if he were amazed to finde himſelfe accompanied; yet, though his heart were cheared with wine, the place ſolitarie, the night ſilent, the perſon comely, the inuitation plauſible, could hee be drawne to a raſh act of luſt▪ His appetite could not get the victorie of reaſon, tho it had wine and oportunitie to helpe it; Herein Boaz ſhowd himſelfe a great maſter of his

affections, that hee was able to reſiſt a fit tentation; It is no thanke to many that they are free of ſome euills; perhaps they wanted not will, but conuenience; But if a man when hee is fitted with all helps to his ſin, can repell the pleaſure of ſin, out of conſcience; this is true fortitude.
                     In ſteed of touching her as a wanton, he bleſſes her as a father, incourageth her as a friend, promiſeth her as a kinſman, rewards her as a patron, &amp; ſends hir away lade with hopes, &amp; gifts, no leſſe chaſte, more happy then ſhee came: Oh admirable temperance worthy the progenitor of him, in whoſe lips and heart was no guile.
                     
                        
If Boaz had been the next kinſman, the marriage had needed no protraction, but now that his conſcience told him, that Ruth was the right of another, it had not been more ſenſualitie then iniuſtice, to haue touched his kinſwoman; It was not any bodily impotencie, but honeſtie and conſcience that reſtrained Boaz, for the very next night ſhee conceiued by him; that good man wiſhed his mariage bed holy, and durſt not lye downe in the doubt of a ſinne: Many a man is honeſt out of neceſſitie, and affects the praiſe of that, which hee could not auoide; but that mans minde is ſtill an adulterer, in the forced continence of his bodie;

No action can giue vs true comfort, but that which we do out of the grounds of obedience.
                     Thoſe which are fearefull of ſinning, are carefull not to bee thought to ſin; Boaz, though he knew himſelfe to be cleare, would not haue occaſion of ſuſpicion giuen to others; (Let no man know that a woman came into the floore:) A good heart is no leſſe afraide of a ſcandall, then of a ſin; whereas thoſe that are reſolued not to make any ſcruple of ſin, deſpiſe others conſtructions, not caring whom they offend, ſo that they may pleaſe themſelues. That Naomi might ſee her daughter in law was not ſent backe in diſlike;

ſhe comes home laden with corne; Ruth hath gleaned more this night, then in halfe the harueſt; The care of Boaz was, that ſhe ſhould not returne to her mother emptie: Loue whereſoeuer it is, cannot bee niggardly; Wee meaſure the loue of God by his gifts; How ſhall hee abide to ſend vs away emptie from thoſe treaſures of goodneſſe.
                     
                        Boaz is reſtleſſe in the proſecution of this ſute; and hies him from his threſhing floore, to the gate; and there conuents the nearer kinſman before the Elders of the Citty; what was it that made Boaz ſo readie to

intertaine, ſo forward to vrge this match? Wealth ſhe had none, not ſo much as bread, but what ſhe gleaned out of his fielde: Friends ſhe had none, and thoſe ſhe had elſe where, Moabites; Beauty ſhe could not haue much, after that ſcorching in her trauell, in her gleanings, Himſelfe tells her what drew his heart to her, (All the Citie of my people doth know that thou art a vertuous woman:) Vertue in whomſoeuer it is found, is a great dowry, and where it meetes with an heart that knowes how to value it, is accounted greater riches then all that is hid in the bowels of the earth: The corne heape of Boaz was but chaffe to this, &amp; his mony, droſſe.
                     
                        
As a man that had learned to ſquare all his actions to the law of God, Boaz proceeds legally with his riuall; and tells him of a parcell of Elimelecs land (which, it is like vpon his remouall to Moab, he had alienated;) which he (as the next kinſman) might haue power to redeeme; yet ſo, as he muſt purchaſe the wife of the deceaſed, with the land; Euery kinſman is not a Bonz, the man could liſten to the land, if it had beene free from the clog of a neceſſary marriage; but now he will rather leaue the land, then take the wife; Leaſt, whiles he ſhould preſerue Elimelecs inheritance, he ſhould deſtroy his owne; for the next ſeede, which he ſhould haue by

                        Ruth, ſhould not be his heire, but his deceaſed kinſmans; How knew he whether God might not by that wife, ſend heires enow for both their eſtates? rather had he therefore incurre a manifeſt iniuſtice, then hazard the danger of his inheritance; The law of God bound him to raiſe vp ſeede to the next in blood; the care of his inheritance drawes him to a neglect of his duty, tho with infamy and reproch, and now he had rather his face ſhould bee ſpit vpon, and his name ſhould bee called, The houſe of him whoſe ſhooe was pull'd off, then to reſerue the honour of him, that did his brother right, to his owne preiudice; How many

are there that doe ſo ouer-loue their iſſue, as that they regard neither ſinne, nor ſhame in aduancing it? and that will rather indaunger their ſoule then leeſe their name? It is a wofull inheritance that makes men heires of the vengeance of God.
                     
                        Boaz is glad to take the aduantage of his refuſall; and holds that ſhooe (which was the ſigne of his tenure) more worth then all the land of Elimelec. And whereas other Wiues purchaſe their husbands, with a large dowrie, this man purchaſeth his wife, at a deare rate, and thinkes his bargaine happy; All the ſubſtance

of the earth, is not worth a vertuous and prudent wife; which Boaz doth now ſo reioyce in, as if he this day onely began to be wealthy.
                     Now is Ruth taken into the houſe of Boaz; ſhe, that before had ſaid, ſhe was not like one of his maidens, is now become their miſtreſſe; This day ſhe hath gleaned all the fields and barnes of a rich husband; and (that there might be no want in her happineſſe) by a gracious husband ſhe hath gained an happy ſeede; and hath the honour, aboue all the dames of Iſrael, to be the great grandmother of a King, of Dauid, of the Meſsiah.
                     
                     
                        
Now is Marah turn'd backe againe to Naomi; and Orpah, if ſhe heare of this in Moab, cannot but enuie at her ſiſters happines: Oh the ſure and bountifull payments of the Almightie; Who euer came vnder his wing in vaine? Who euer loſt by truſting him? Who euer forſooke the Moab of this world for the true Iſrael, and did not at laſt reioyce in the change.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        Anna and Peninna.
                     
                     
                        ILL cuſtomes where they are once intertained are not eaſily diſcharged; Polygamie beſides carnall delight might now plead age and example: ſo as euen Elkanah (though a Leuite) is tainted with the ſinne of Lamech; Like as faſhions of attire, which at the firſt were diſliked as vncomely, yet when they are once growne common, are taken vp of the graueſt: Yet this ſinne (as then currant with the time) could not make Elkanah, not religious;

The houſe of God in Shilo was duely frequented of him; oftentimes, alone, in his ordinary courſe of attendance; with all his males, thriſe a yeare; and once a yeare, with all his familie; The continuance of an vnknowne ſin cannot hinder the vprightnes of a mans heart with God; as a man may haue a mole vpon his backe, and yet thinke his skin cleare; the leaſt touch of knowledge, or wilfulnes marres his ſincerity.
                     He that by vertue of his place was imploied about the ſacrifices of others, would much leſſe neglect his own; It is a ſhame for him that teaches Gods people that they ſhould not appeare before the Lord

empty, to bring no ſacrifice for himſelfe. If Leuites be profane, who ſhould be religious?
                     It was the faſhion when they ſacrificed, to feaſt; ſo did Elkanah; the day of his deuotion is the day of his triumph; he makes great cheere for his whole familie, euen for that wife which he loued leſſe; There is nothing more comely, then cheerefulnes in the ſeruices of God; What is there in all the world, wherewith the hart of man ſhould be ſo lift vp, as with the conſcience of his dutie done to his maker? Whiles wee doe ſo, God doth to vs, as our glaſſe, ſmile vpon vs, while we ſmile on him.
                     
                        
Loue will be ſeen by entertainment; Peninnah and her children ſhall not complaine of want, but Anna ſhall finde her husbands affection in her portion; as his loue to her was double, ſo was her part; She fared not the worſe, becauſe ſhe was childleſſe; no good husband will diſlike his wife for a fault out of the power of her redreſſe: yea rather, that which might ſeeme to looſe the loue of her husband, wins it, her barrenneſſe; The good nature of Elkanah laboured by his deare reſpects, to recompence this affliction; that ſo ſhe might finde no leſſe contentment in the fruit of his hearty loue, then ſhe had greife from hir owne fruitleſneſſe; It

is the property of true mercy, to be moſt fauorable to the weakeſt; Thus doth the gracious ſpouſe of the Chriſtian ſoule pittie the barrenneſſe of his ſeruants; O Sauiour, we ſhould not finde thee ſo indulgent to vs, if wee did not complaine of our owne vnworthineſſe: Peninnah may haue the more children but barren Annah hath the moſt loue; How much rather could Elkanah haue wiſhed Peninnah barren; and Annah fruitfull; but if ſhe ſhould haue had both iſſue, and loue, ſhe had been proud, and her riuall deſpiſed; God knowes how to diſperſe his fauours ſo, that euery one may haue cauſe both of thankfulneſſe and humiliation; whiles there is

no one that hath all, no one but hath ſome; If enuie and contempt were not thus equally tempered, ſome would be ouer hauty, and others too miſerable; But now, euery man ſees that in himſelfe which is worthy of contempt, and matter of emulation in others, and contrarily ſees what to pittie and diſlike in the moſt eminent, and what to applaud in himſelfe, and out of this contrarietie, ariſes a ſweete meane of contentation.
                     The loue of Elkanah is ſo vnable to free Anna from the wrongs of her riuall, that it procures them rather; The vnfruitfulneſſe of Anna had neuer with ſo

much deſpight beene laid in her diſh, if her husbands heart had been as barren of loue to her; Enuie though it take aduantage of our weakeneſſes, yet is euer raiſed vpon ſome grounds of happines, in them whom it emulates; It is euer an ill effect of a good cauſe: If Abels ſacrifice had not beene accepted, and if the acceptation of his ſacrifice had not beene a bleſſing, no enuie had followed vpon it.
                     There is no euill of another, wherein it is fit to reioyce, but his Enuie; and this is worthy of our ioy, and thankfulneſſe, becauſe it ſhowes vs the price of that good, which wee had, and

valued not; The malignitie of enuie is thus well anſwered, when it is made the euill cauſe of a good effect to vs; when God and our ſoules may gaine by anothers ſinne. I do now finde that Anna inſulted vpon Peninnah, for the greater meaſure of her husbands loue, as Peninna did vpon her, for her fruitfulneſſe; Thoſe that are truely gracious, know how to receiue the bleſſings of God, without contempt of them that want; and haue learned to bee thankefull, without ouerlineſſe.
                     Enuie when it is once conceiued in a malicious heart, is like fire in billers of Iuniper, which

(they ſay) continues more yeares then one; Euery yeare was Anna thus vexed with her emulous partner; and troubled, both in her praiers and meales; Amidſt all their feaſtings, ſhee fed on nothing but her teares: Some diſpoſitions are leſſe ſenſible, and more careleſſe of the diſpight and 
                           •••
                        ties of others, and can turne ouer vnkinde vſages, with contempt; By how much more tender the heart is, ſo much more deeply is it euer affected with diſcurteſies▪ As waxe receiues and retaines that impreſſion, which in the hard clay cannot be ſeen; or, as the eie feeles that mote, which the skin of the eie-lid could not complain of: Yet the husband of Anna
                        
(as one that knew his dutie) labours by his loue, to comfort her againſt theſe diſcontentments, Why weepeſt thou? Am not I better to thee then ten ſonnes? It is the weakneſſe of good natures, to giue ſo much aduantage to an enemie; what would malice rather haue then the vexation of them whom it perſecutes? Wee cannot better pleaſe an aduerſarie, then by hurting our ſelues; This is no other, then to humor enuie, to ſerue the turne of thoſe, that maligne vs; and to draw on that malice, whereof we are weary; whereas careleſneſſe puts ill will out of countenance; and makes it withdraw it ſelfe in a rage, as that which doth but ſhame the author,

without the hurt of the patient: In cauſeleſſe wrongs the beſt remedie is contempt.
                     She that could not finde comfort in the louing perſwaſions of her husband, ſeeks it in her prayers; She riſes vp hungry from the feaſt, and hyes her to the Temple; there ſhee powres out her teares, and ſupplications; Whatſoeuer the complaint be, here is the remedie; There is one vniuerſall receit for all euills, prayer; When all helps faile vs, this remaines, and whiles wee haue an heart, comforts it.
                     Here was not more bitterneſſe in the ſoule of Anna, then feruencie;

ſhee did not onely weep and pray, but vow vnto God; If God will giue her a ſonne, ſhe will giue her ſonne to God backe againe; Euen nature it ſelfe had conſecrated her ſon to God; for he could not but be borne a Leuite; But if his birth make him a Leuite, her vow ſhal make him a Nazarite, &amp; dedicate his minoritie to the Tabernacle; The way to obtaine any benefit, is to deuote it in our hearts, to the glory of that God, of whom wee aske it; by this meanes ſhall God both pleaſure his ſeruant, and honour himſelfe; Whereas, if the ſcope of our deſires be carnall, wee may be ſure either to faile of our ſuite, or of a bleſſing.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        Ely and Anna.
                     
                     
                        OLd Ely ſits on a ſtoole, by one of the poſts of the Tabernacle; where ſhould the Prieſts of God be but in the Temple? whether for action or for ouer-ſight; Their very preſence keeps Gods houſe in order, and the preſence of God keeps their hearts in order.
                     It is oft found that thoſe which are themſelues conſcionable, are

too forward to the cenſuring of others; Good Ely, becauſe hee markes the lips of Annah to moue without noyſe, chides her as drunken, and vncharitably miſconſtrues her deuotion; It was a weake ground whereon to build ſo heauie a ſentence; If ſhe had ſpoken too loude, and incompoſedly, hee might haue had ſome iuſt colour for this conceit, but now to accuſe her ſilence (notwithſtanding all the teares which he ſaw) of drunkenneſſe, it was a zealous breach of charitie.
                     Some ſpirit would haue been enraged with ſo raſh a cenſure; when anger meets with griefe, both turne into furie
                           •
                        ; but

this good woman had been inured to reproches, and beſides, did well ſee the reproofe aroſe from meſpriſon, and the meſpriſon from zeale; and therefore anſwers meekly, as one that had rather ſatisfie, then expoſtulate, Nay my Lord, but I am a woman troubled in ſpirit; Hely may now learne charitie of Annah: If ſhe had been in that diſtemper, whereof he accuſed her, his iuſt reproofe had not been ſo eaſily digeſted; Guiltineſſe is commonly clamorous, and impatient, wheras innocence is ſilent, and careleſſe of miſreports; It is naturall vnto all men to wipe off from their name all aſperſions of euill, but none doe it with ſuch violence, as they

which are faultie; It is a ſigne the horſe is galled, that ſtirs too much when he is touched.
                     Shee that was cenſured for drunken, cenſures drunkenneſſe more deeply then her reprouer; Count not thine handmaid, for a daughter of Belial; The drunkards ſtile begins in lawleſueſſe, proceeds in vnprofitableneſſe, ends in miſerie; and all ſhut vp in the denomination of this pedegree; A ſonne of Belial.
                     If Hannah had been tainted with this ſinne, ſhe would haue denied it with more fauour, and haue diſclaimed it with an extenuation; What if I ſhould haue

been merrie with wine, yet I might bee deuout? If I ſhould haue ouer-ioyed in my ſacrifice to God, one cup of exceſſe had not been ſo haynous; now her freedome is ſeene in her ſeueritie; Thoſe which haue cleare hearts from any ſinne, proſecute it with rigour; whereas the guiltie are euer partiall; their conſcience holds their hands, and tells them that they beat themſelues, whiles they puniſh others.
                     Now Hely ſees his error, and recants it; and to make amends for his raſh cenſure, prayes for her; Euen the beſt may erre, but not perſiſt in it; When good natures haue offended, they are vnquiet

till they haue haſtned ſatisfaction; This was within his office, to pray for the diſtreſſed; Wherefore ſerues the Prieſt but to ſacrifice for the people; and the beſt ſacrifices are the prayers of faith.
                     Shee that began her prayers with faſting, and heauineſſe, riſes vp from them with cheerefulneſſe, and repaſt: It cannot bee ſpoken, how much eaſe and ioy the heart of man findes in hauing vnloaded his cares, and powred out his ſupplications into the eares of God; ſince it is well aſſured, that the ſuite which is faithfully asked, is already granted in heauen: The

conſcience may well reſt, when it tells vs, that wee haue neglected no meanes of redreſſing our affliction; for then it may reſolue to looke either for amendment, or patience.
                     The ſacrifice is ended, and now Elkanah, and his familie riſe vp early, to returne vnto Ramah; but they dare not ſet forward, till they haue worſhipped before the Lord; That iourney cannot hope to proſper, that takes not God with it; The way to receiue bleſſings at home, is to be deuout at the Temple.
                     She that before conceiued faith in her heart, now conceiues a

ſonne in her wombe; God will rather worke miracles then faithfull prayers ſhall returne empty: I doe not finde that Peninna asked any ſonne of God, yet ſhe had ſtore; Anna begged hard for this one; and could not till now obtaine him: They which are deareſt to God doe oft-times with great difficultie worke out thoſe bleſſings, which fall into the mouthes of the careleſſe: That wiſe diſpoſer of all things knowes it fit to hold vs ſhort of thoſe fauours which we ſue for; whether for the tryall of our patience, or the exerciſe of our faith, or the increaſe of our importunitie, or the doubling of our obligation.
                     
                        
Thoſe children are moſt like to proue bleſſings, which the Parents haue begged of God; and which are no leſſe the fruit of our ſupplications, then of our bodie; As this childe was the ſonne of his mothers prayers, and was conſecrated to God ere his poſſibilitie of being; ſo now himſelfe ſhall know, both how hee came, and whereto hee was ordeined; and leſt hee ſhould forget it, his very name ſhall teach him both; (She called his name Samuel); Hee cannot ſo much as heare himſelfe named, but hee muſt needs remember both the extraordinarie mercie of God in giuing him to a barren mother; and the vow of his mother in reſtoring him backe to

God by her zealous dedication; and by both of them learne holineſſe, and obedience: There is no neceſſitie of ſignificant names; but wee cannot haue too many monitors to put vs in minde of our dutie.
                     It is wont to be the fathers priuiledge to name his childe; but becauſe this was his mothers ſon, begotten more by her prayers, then the ſeed of Elkanah, it was but reaſon, ſhe ſhould haue the chiefe hand both in his name▪ and diſpoſing; It had been indeed in the power of Elkanah, to haue changed both his name, and profeſſion, and to abrogate the vow of his wife;

that wiues might know, they were not their owne; and that the rib might learne to know the head; but husbands ſhall abuſe their authoritie, if they ſhall wilfully croſſe the holy purpoſes, and religious indeuours of their yoke-fellowes; How much more fit is it for them to cheriſh all good deſires in the weaker veſſells; and as we vſe, when wee carrie a ſmall light in a winde, to hide it with our lap, or hand, that it may not goe out; If the wife bee a Vine, the husband ſhould be an Elme to vphold he
                           •
                         in all worthy enterpriſes; Elſ
                           •
                         ſhee falls to the ground, an
                           •
                         proues fruitleſſe.
                     
                        
The yeere is now come about; and Elkanah calls his familie to their holy iourney; to goe vp to Ieruſalem, for the aniuerſarie ſolemnity of their ſacrifice; Annaes heart is with them, but ſhe hath a good excuſe to ſtay at home, the charge of her Samuel; her ſucceſſe in the Temple, keeps her happily from the Temple; that her deuotion may bee doubled, becauſe it was reſpited: God knowes how to diſpenſe with neceſſities; but, if we ſuffer idle and needleſſe occaſions to hold vs from the Tabernacle of God, our hearts are but hollow to religion.
                     Now at laſt, when the childe was weaned from her hand, ſhe

goes vp, and payes her vow, and with it, payes the intereſt of her intermiſſion: Neuer did Anna go vp with ſo glad an heart to Shilo, as now that ſhe carries God this reaſonable preſent, which himſelfe gaue to her, and ſhe vowed to him; accompanied with the bountie of other ſacrifices, more in number and meaſure, then the Law of God required of her; and all this, is too little for her God, that ſo mercifully remembred her affliction, and miraculouſly remedied it; Thoſe hearts which are truly thankfull, doe no leſſe reioyce in their repayment, then in their receit; and doe as much ſtudie, how to ſhow their humble and feruent

affections, for what they haue, as how to compaſſe fauours when they want them; Their debt is their burden, which when they haue diſcharged, they are at eaſe.
                     If Anna had repented of her vow, and not preſented her ſon to the Tebernacle, Ely could not haue challenged him; He had only ſeen her lips ſtir, not hearing the promiſe of her heart; It was enought, that her owne ſoule knew her vow, and God which was greater then it; The obligation of a ſecret vow is no leſſe, then if it had ten thouſand witneſſes.
                     Old Hely could not chooſe but much reioyce to ſee this fruit

of thoſe lips, which he thought moued with wine; and this good proofe, both of the mercifull audience of God, and the thankfull fidelity of his handmaide; this ſight calls him down to his knees (He worſhipped the Lord); We are vnprofitable witneſſes of the mercies of God, and the graces of men, if we do not glorifie him for others ſakes, no leſſe then for our owne.
                     
                        Hely and Anna grew now better acquainted; neither had he ſo much cauſe to praiſe God for her, as ſhe aftewards for him; For if her owne praiers obtained her firſt childe; his bleſſing inriched her with fiue more; If ſhe had not

giuen her firſt ſonne to God, ere ſhe had him; I doubt, whether ſhe had not been euer barren; or if ſhee had kept her Samuel at home, whether euer ſhe had conceiued againe; now that piety which ſtripped her of her onely childe, for the ſeruice of her God, hath multiplied the fruit of her wombe, and gaue her fiue for that one, which was ſtill no leſſe hers, becauſe he was Gods: There is no ſo certaine way of increaſe, as to lend, or giue vnto the owner of all things.
                  
                  
                     
                     Ely and his Sonnes.
                     
                        IF the conueyances of grace were naturall; holy parents would not be ſo ill ſuted with children: What good man would not rather wiſh his loynes drie, then fruitfull of wickedneſſe? Now, wee can neither traduce goodnes, nor chooſe but traduce ſinne; If vertue were as well intailed vpon vs, as ſin, one might ſerue to checke the other in our children; but now ſince grace is deriued from heauen on whomſoeuer

it pleaſes the giuer, and that euill which ours receiue hereditarily from vs, is multiplied by their owne corruption, it can be no wonder that good men haue ill children, it is rather a wonder that any children are not euill: The ſonnes of Ely are as lewde, as himſelfe was holy; If the goodneſſe of examples, precepts, education, profeſſion could haue beene preſeruatiues from extremitie of ſin, theſe ſonnes of an holy father had not beene wicked; now, neither parentage, nor breeding, nor prieſthood can keepe the ſonnes of Hely from ſonnes of Belial; If our children bee good, let vs thanke God for it; this

was more then wee could giue them; if euill they may thanke vs, and themſelues; vs, for their birth-ſinne, themſelues for the improuement of it to that height of wickedneſſe.
                     If they had not been ſonnes of Ely, yet being Prieſts of God, who would not haue hoped their very calling ſhould haue infuſed ſome holineſſe into them; but now, euen their white Ephod couers foule ſinnes; yea rather, if they which ſerue at the alter degenerate, their wickedneſſe is ſo much more aboue others, as their place is holier; A wicked Prieſt is the worſt creature vpon earth; Who are Diuels but they which were

once Angels of light? Who can ſtumble at the ſinnes of the Euangelicall Leuites, that ſees ſuch inpuritie euen before the Arke of God? That God which promiſed to be the Leuites portion, had ſet forth the portion of his Miniſters; he will feaſt them at his owne altar; The breaſt and the right ſhoulder of the peace offering was their morſell; theſe bold and couetous Prieſts will rather haue the fleſh-hock their arbiter, then God; whatſoeuer thoſe three teeth faſten vpon, ſhall bee for their tooth; They were weary of one ioynt, and now their delicacy affects variety; God is not worthy to carue for theſe men, but their owne hands; And this they

do not receiue, but take; and take violently, vnſeaſonably; It had beene fit God ſhould be firſt ſerued; their preſumption will not ſtay his leaſure; ere the fat bee burned, ere the fleſh be boiled, they ſnatch more then their ſhare from the altar; as if the God of heauen ſhould waite on their palate; as if the Iſraelites had come thither to ſacrifice to their bellies; and (as commonly a wanton tooth is the harbinger to luxurious wantonneſſe) they are no ſooner fed, then they neigh after the dames of Iſrael; Holy women aſſemble to the doore of the Tabernacle; theſe varlets tempt them to luſt, that came thither for deuotion; they had wiues of

their owne, yet their vnbridled deſires roue after ſtrangers, and feare not to pollute euen that holy place with abominable filthineſſe, O ſinnes, to ſhamefull for men; much more for the ſpirituall guides of Iſrael! He that makes himſelfe a ſeruant to his tooth, ſhall eaſily become a ſlaue to all inordinate affections: That altar which expiated other mens ſins, added to the ſinnes of the ſacrificers; Doubtleſſe many a ſoule was the cleaner for the bloud of the ſacrifices, which they ſhed, whiles their owne were more impure; And as the altar cannot ſanctifie the Preiſt, ſo the vncleannes of the miniſter cannot pollute the offering; becauſe the vertue

thereof is not in the agent, but in the inſtitution; in the repreſentation his ſinne is his owne; the comfort of the ſacrament is from God; Our clergy is no charter for heauen; Euen thoſe whoſe trade is deuotion, may at once ſhow the way to heauen by their tongue, and by their foot lead the way to hell; It is neither a coule, nor an Ephod that can priueledge the ſoule.
                     The ſinne of theſe men was worthy of contempt, yea perhaps their perſons; but for the people therefore to abhorre the offrings of the Lord, was to adde their euill vnto the Prieſts; and to offend God, becauſe hee was

offended; There can no offence be iuſtly taken, euen at men; much leſſe at God for the ſake of men: No mans ſinnes ſhould bring the ſeruice of God into diſlike; this is to make holy thinges guiltie of our profaneneſſe: It is a daungerous ignorance not to diſtinguiſh betwixt the worke, and the inſtrument; whereupon it oft comes to paſſe, that we fall out with God, becauſe we finde cauſe of offence from men; and giue God iuſt cauſe to abhorre vs, becauſe wee abhorre his ſeruice vniuſtly. Although it be true (of great men eſpecially) that they are the laſt that know the euils of their owne houſe, yet either it could

not be, when all Iſrael rung of the lewdneſſe of Elyes ſonnes, that he onely ſhould not know it, or if he knew it not, his ignorance cannot be excuſed; for a ſeaſonable reſtraint might haue preuented this extremitie of debauchedneſſe. Complaints are long muttered of the great, ere they dare breake forth to open conteſtation; publique accuſations of authoritie argues intollerable extremities of euill; nothing but age can pleade for Ely, that hee was not the firſt accuſer of his ſonnes; now when their enormities came to be the voice of the multitude, he muſt heare it perforce; and doubtleſſe hee heard it with greife enough, but not

with anger enough; he that was the iudge of Iſrael, ſhould haue vnpartially iudged his own fleſh, and blood; neuer could he haue offered a more pleaſing ſacrifice, then the depraued blood of ſo wicked ſonnes; In vaine do wee rebuke thoſe ſinnes abroad, which we tolerate at home; That man makes himſelfe but ridiculous, that leauing his owne houſe on fire, runnes to quench his neighbours.
                     I heard Ely ſharpe enough to Annah, vpon but a ſuſpicion of ſinne; and now, how milde I finde him to the notorious crimes of his owne? Why doe you ſo my ſonnes: it is no good report; my ſonnes

do no more ſo; The caſe is altered with the perſons; if nature may be allowed to ſpeake in iudgement, and to make difference, not of ſinnes but offenders, the ſentence muſt needes ſauour of partialitie; Had theſe men but ſome little ſlackened their dutie, or heedleſly omitted ſome rite of the ſacrifice, this cenſure had not beene vnfit; but to puniſh the thefts, rapines, ſacriledges, adulteries, inceſts of his ſonnes, with Why do yee ſo, was no other then to ſ
                           •
                        aue that head, which had deſerued cutting off; As it is with ill humors, that a weak doſe doth but ſtirre, and anger them, not purge them out; ſo it fareth with ſinnes; An eaſie reproofe

doth but incourage wickedneſſe, and makes it thinke it ſelfe ſo ſleight, as that cenſure importeth; A vehement rebuke to a capitall euill, is but like a ſtrong ſhower to a ripe fielde; which laies that corne which were worthy of a ſickle. It is a breach of iuſtice not to proportionate the puniſhment to the offence; To whip a man for a murder, or to puniſh the purſe for inceſt, or to burne treaſon in the hand, or to award the ſtocks to burglairy, is to patronize euill, in ſteed of auenging it; Of the two extremes, rigor is more ſafe for the publique weale, becauſe the ouer-puniſhing of one offender frights many from ſinning:

It is better to liue in a common-welth where nothing is lawfull, then where euery thing.
                     Indulgent Parents are cruell to themſelues, and their poſteritie Ely could not haue deuiſed which way to haue plagued himſelfe, and his houſe ſo much, as by his kindneſſe to his childrens ſinnes; what variety of iudgements doth he now heare of from the meſſenger of God? Firſt, becauſe his old age (which vſes to be ſubiect to choler), inclined now to miſfauor his ſonnes, therefore, there ſhall not be an old man left of his houſe for euer; and becauſe it vexed him not enough, to ſee his

ſonnes enemies to God in their profeſſion, therefore he ſhall ſee his enemie in the habitation of the Lord; and becauſe himſelfe forbore to take vengeance of his ſons, and eſteemed their life aboue the glory of his Maſter, therefore God will reuenge himſelfe, by killing them both in one day; and becauſe he abuſed his ſoueraigntie by conniuence at ſinne, therefore ſhall his houſe be ſtripped of this honor, and ſee it tranſlated to another; and laſtly, becauſe he ſuffered his ſonnes to pleaſe their owne wanton appetite, in taking meat off from Gods trencher, therfore, thoſe which remaine of his houſe ſhall come to his ſucceſſors, to beg a piece of ſiluer,

and a morſell of bread; in a word, becauſe hee was partiall to his ſonnes, God ſhall execute all this ſeuerely vpon him, and them: I doe not read of any fault Ely had, but indulgence; and which of the notorious offenders were plagued more? Parents need no other meanes to make them miſerable, then ſparing the rod.
                     Who ſhould be the bearer of theſe fearefull tidings to Ely, but yong Samuel, whom himſelfe had trained vp; He was now growne paſt his mothers cotes, fit for the meſſage of God; Old Ely rebuked not his yong ſonnes, therefore yong Samuel is ſent to rebuke him; I maruell not whiles the Prieſthood

was ſo corrupted, if the word of God were precious, if there were no publike viſion; It is not the manner of God to grace the vnworthy; The ordinarie miniſtration in the Temple was too much honor for thoſe that robbed the Altar, though they had no extraordinarie reuelations; Hereupon it was, that God lets old Hely ſleep (who ſlept in his ſinne) and awakes Samuel, to tell him what hee would do with his maſter: Hee which was wont to be the mouth of God to the people, muſt now receiue the meſſage of God, from the mouth of another; As great perſons will not ſpeake to thoſe, with whom they are highly offended, but

ſend them their checks by others
                     The lights of the Temple were now dim, and almoſt ready to giue place to the morning, when God called Samuel; to ſignifie perhaps, that thoſe which ſhould haue been the lights of Iſrael, burned no leſſe dimly, and were neere their going out, and ſhould be ſucceeded with one, ſo much more lightſome then they, as the Sunne was more bright then the lampes: God had good leaſure to haue deliuered this meſſage by day, but hee meant to make vſe of Samuels miſtaking; and therfore ſo ſpeaks, that Ely may bee asked for an anſwer, and perceiue himſelfe

both omitted, and cenſured; He that meant to vſe Samuels voice to Ely, imitates the voice of Ely to Samuel; Samuel had ſo accuſtomed himſelfe to obedience, and to anſwer the call of Ely, that lying in the further cells of the Leuites, hee is eaſily raiſed from his ſleep; and euen in the night runs for his meſſage, to him, who was rather to receiue it from him: Thrice is the old man diſquieted with the diligence of his ſeruant, and, tho viſions were rare in his daies, yet is hee not ſo vnacquainted with God, as not to attribute that voyce to him, which himſelfe heard not; Wherefore like a better Tutor then a Parent,

he teaches Samuel what hee ſhall anſwer, Speake Lord, for thy ſeruant heareth.
                     
                     It might haue pleaſed God at the firſt call to haue deliuered his meſſage to Samuel, not expecting the anſwer of a nouice vnſeene in the viſions of a God; yet doth he rather defer it till the fourth ſummons, and will not ſpeake till Samuel confeſſed his audience: God loues euer to prepare his ſeruants for his imployments, and will not commit his errands, but to thoſe, whom he hath addreſſed both by wonder, and attention, and humilitie.
                     
                        Ely knew well the gracious faſhion

of God, that where hee intended a fauour, prorogation could be no hinderance; and therefore after the call of God, thrice anſwered with ſilence, he inſtructs Samuel to be ready for the fourth: If Samuels ſilence had been wilfull, I doubt whether he had been againe ſolicited; now God doth both pittie his error, and requite his diligence by redoubling his name at the laſt.
                     
                        Samuel had now many yeeres miniſtred before the Lord, but neuer till now heard his voice; and now heares it with much terror; for the firſt word that he heares God ſpeake, is threatning, and that of vengeance to his

maſter; What were theſe menaces but ſo many premonitions to himſelfe that ſhould ſucceed Ely? God begins early to ſeaſon their harts with feare, whom he means to make eminent inſtruments of his glory; It is his mercie to make vs witneſſes of the iudgments of others, that wee may be forewarned, ere we haue the occaſions of ſinning.
                     I do not heare God bid Samuel deliuer this meſſage to Ely; Hee that was but now made a Prophet, knowes, that the errands of God intend not ſilence; and that God would not haue ſpoken to him of another, if he had meant the newes ſhould be reſerued to himſelfe: Neither yet did he run

with open mouth vnto Ely, to tell him this viſion, vnasked; No wiſe man will be haſtie to bring ill tidings to the great; rather doth hee ſtay till the importunitie of his Maſter ſhould wring it from his vnwillingneſſe; and then, as his concealement ſhowd his loue, ſo his full relation ſhall approue his fidelitie: If the heart of Ely had not told him this newes, before God told it Samuel, hee had neuer been ſo inſtant with Samuel, not to conceale it; His conſcience did well preſage that it concerned himſelfe; Guiltineſſe needs no Prophet to aſſure it of puniſhment: The minde that is troubled proiecteth terrible things;

and though it cannot ſingle out the iudgment allotted to it, yet it is in a confuſed expectation of ſome grieuous euill: Surely, Ely could not thinke it worſe then it was; The ſentence was fearefull, and ſuch as I wonder the necke, or the heart of old Ely could hold out the report of; That God ſweares he will iudge Elyes houſe; and that with beggerie, with death, with deſolation; and that the wickednes of his houſe ſhall not be purged with ſacrifice, or offrings for euer; And yet, this which euery Iſraelites eare ſhould tingle to heare of, when it ſhould be done, old Ely heares with an vnmoued patience, and humble ſubmiſſion, It is the Lord, let him

doe what ſeemeth him good; Oh admirable faith, and more then humane conſtancie and reſolution, worthy of the aged preſiſident of Shiloh, worthy of an heart ſacrificed to that God, whoſe iuſtice had refuſed to expiate his ſinne by ſacrifice: If Ely haue been an ill father to his ſonnes, yet he is a good ſonne to God, and is ready to kiſſe the very rod hee ſhall ſmart withall; It is the Lord, whom I haue euer found holy, and iuſt, and gracious, and hee cannot but be himſelfe; Let him doe what ſeemeth him good; for whatſoeuer ſeemeth good to him, cannot but bee good; howſoeuer it ſeemes to me: Euery man can open

his hand to God while hee bleſſes; but to expoſe our ſelues willingly to the afflicting hand of our maker, and to kneele to him whiles he ſcourges vs, is peculiar only to the faithfull.
                     If euer a good heart could haue freed a man, from temporall puniſhments, Ely muſt needs haue eſcaped; Gods anger was appeaſed by his humble repentance, but his iuſtice muſt be ſatisfied; Elyes ſinne and his ſons, was in the eye and mouth of all Iſrael, his glorie therefore ſhould haue been much wronged by their impunitie: Who would not haue made theſe ſpirituall guides an example of lawleſnes?

and haue ſaid; What care I how I liue, if Elyes ſonnes goe away vnpuniſhed? As not the teares of Ely, ſo not the words of Samuel may fall to the ground; Wee may not meaſure the diſpleaſure of God by his ſtripes; many times, after the remiſſion of the ſinne, the very chaſtiſements of the Almightie are deadly; No repentance can aſſure vs that wee ſhall not ſmart with outward afflictions: That, can preuent the eternall diſpleaſure of God; but ſtill it may be neceſſarie and good wee ſhould be corrected: Our care and ſuite muſt be, that the euills which ſhall not be auerted, may be ſanctified.
                     
                        
If the prediction of theſe euils were fearefull, what ſhall the execution be? The preſumption of the ill-taught Iſraelites ſhall giue occaſion to this iudgement; for being ſmitten before the Philiſtims, they ſend for the Arke into the field; Who gaue them authority to commaund the Arke of God at their pleaſure? Here was no conſulting with the Arke, which they would fetch; no inquiry of Samuel whether they ſhould fetch it; but an heddie reſolution of preſumptuous Elders to force God into the field, and to challenge ſucceſſe: If God were not with the Arke, why did they ſend for it, and reioyce in the comming of it?

If God were with it, why was not his allowance asked that it ſhould come? How can the people bee good where the Preiſts are wicked? When the Arke of the couenant of the Lord of hoſts that dwells betweene the Cherubims, was brought into the hoſt (tho with meane and wicked attendance) Iſrael doth, as it were, fill the heauen, and ſhake the earth with ſhoutes; as if the Arke and victory were no leſſe vnſeparable, then they and their ſinnes; Euen the leudeſt men will be looking for fauour from that God, whom they cared not to diſpleaſe, contrary to the conſcience of their deſeruings; Preſumption doth the ſame

in wicked men, which faith doth in the holieſt; Thoſe that regarded not the God of the Arke, thinke themſelues ſafe and happie in the Arke of God; vaine men are tranſported with a confidence in the out-ſides of religion, not regarding the ſubſtance and ſoule of it, which only can giue them true peace; But rather then God will humor ſuperſtition in Iſraelites, he will ſuffer his owne Arke to fall into the handes of Philiſtims; Rather will he ſeeme to ſlacken his hand of protection, then hee will bee thought to haue his hands bound by a formall miſ-confidence. The ſlaughter of the Iſraelites was no plague to this; It was

a greater plague rather to them that ſhould ſuruiue, and behold it. The two ſonnes of Ely which had helped to corrupt their brethren, die by the handes of the vncircumciſed, and are now too late ſeparated from the Arke of God by Philiſtims, which ſhould haue been before ſeparated by their father; They had liued formerlie to bring Gods altar into contempt, and now liue to carrie his Arke into captiuitie, and at laſt, as thoſe that had made vp the meaſure of their wickedneſſe are ſlayne in their ſinne.
                     
                        
Ill newes doth euer either run, or flie; The man of Beniamin, which ran from the hoſt, hath ſoone filled the City with outcries; and Elyes eares with the crie of the City; The good old man after ninety and eight yeares, ſits in the gate, as one that neuer thought himſelfe too aged to do God ſeruice; and heares the newes of Iſraels diſcomfiture, and his ſonnes death, though with ſorrow, yet with patience; but, when the meſſenger tells him of the Arke of God taken, he can liue no longer, that word ſtrikes him downe backward from his throne, and kills him in the fall; no ſword of a Philiſtim could haue ſlaine him more painefully, neither

know I, whether his necke, or his heart were firſt broken: Oh fearefull iudgement, that euer any Iſraelites eare could tingle withall; The Arke loſt; what good man would wiſh to liue without God? Who can chooſe but think he hath liued too long, that hath ouerliued the Teſtimonies of Gods preſence with his Church? Yea the very daughter in law of Ely, a woman, the wife of a lewd husband, when ſhe was at once trauelling (vpon that tidings) and in that trauell, dying (to make vp the full ſumme of Gods iudgement vpon that wicked houſe) as one inſenſible of the death of her father, of her husband, of her ſelfe, in compariſon

of this loſſe, calls her (then vnſeaſonable) ſonne, Ichabod; and with her laſt breath ſaies, The glorie is departed from Iſrael; The Arke is taken: what cares ſhe for a poſterity, which ſhould want the Arke? What cares ſhe for a ſonne, come into the world of Iſrael, when God was gone from it? and how willingly doth ſhe depart from them, from whom God was departed? Not outward magnificence, not ſtate, not wealth, not fauour of the mightie, but the preſence of God in his Ordinances, are the glory of Iſrael; the ſubducing whereof is a greater iudgement, then deſtruction.
                     
                        
                        Oh Iſrael, worſe now then no people; a thouſand times more miſerable then Philiſtims; Thoſe Pagans went away triumphing with the Arke of God, and victorie; and leaue the remnants of the choſen people to lament, that they once had a God:
                     
                     
                        Oh cruell and wicked indulgence, that is now found guiltie of the death, not onlie of the Prieſts, and people, but of Religion. Vniuſt mercie can neuer end in leſſe then bloud, and it were well if onlie the bodie ſhould haue cauſe to complaine of that kinde crueltie.
