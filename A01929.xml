            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

loue &amp; burning zeale towards his Contrey was ſuch, as he being
a Prince Roialy diſcended delicately brought vp, beloued and honoured of
all men, of larlge and great reueneues both in England and ſcotland: ſo that
it was thoght he had more contentment of mynd and more bliſings-heaped
on him by heavens then any liveing in his dayes: Yet ſuch was his loue to the
libertie of his countrey, as forſeaking his reveneues, leaveing his wyf &amp; cheldren,
abandoning al his royel delicaſies, pleſurs, and delights, he betook him
ſelf to armes wherein when fortune hade croſd him ſo far as it is ſead he

                  Wherfore he dealt in ſecret with the King,

                  To whoſe baſe minde, at firſt he gaue noe Eare

                  But he that knew my right farr worthier
                  Euen from my foes proud offer did deriue

                  Which offer baſe I plainely did refuſe,
                  Wherefore King Edward in his wrathful Ire,
                  With Baliol decreits, and did abuſe
                  My right, enſtalling him whoſe blind deſire
                  Led him for honor, Infamie to chooſe

                  For loe in him two contraries agree,

                  With all the Lords and Princes of Eſtate
                  The Lords in hait and great diſgrace were thought

                  O bloodie ſtarres why did you thus agree,

                  Why did you al power doune miſchiefe from hie?

                  Faire letters, ſhewing eurie Prince his Name,
                  Beneath their feet an iron throne was made,

                  This hard my ladie like to burſt for greif
                  Tortred with burning love and cold diſdane

                  Whiche to aquite my paines he doth ordane

                  Her ſpotles name for this ſhe wold not ſtaine
                  But cloſlie heapes her pane her greif her woe

                  Leſt hee were thoght of all the moſt ingrate.
               
               
                  Not that he cair'd for creder faith or fame
                  But that he fear'd ſome fatall puniſhment
                  Whill as his paſsion birneth ſo extreame

                  Such greif for his diſeas I did conceaue

                  Of food of reſt of ſleip did me bereaue

                  Now our the weſterne regions did command
                  Greate Eduards Viceroy did a conſail call
                  Wherin with graue aduiſe he chuiſd a band
                  Of warlik Soldiers and ther Captane bold
                  Sir Iugrham Bell, Achampion wiſe and old.
               
               
                  Now theſe for to gane ſtand his poure he ſends
                  And for to keip him ſtill Into the waſt
                  For he him ſelf with greater poure intends
                  To pull the wyde vp be the root at laſt
                  That ſquadron then their Warlick poure extends
                  And marcheing to the toune of air they paſt
                  Wheiras their warie captane minds be ſlight
                  To work his valiaunt foe a foull diſpight.
               
               
                  
                  Within this land an antient kinght did dwell
                  Whoe of oure prince had ſecret frendſcip got
                  He liebail heght whome th' Engliſhe did compell
                  Of his ſad death for to contriue the plot
                  Two valiant ſons he had nay ſons of hell
                  Who ſtainis thair fame with filthie treaſſons blot
                  Nor this their treaſſone wold at all reveale
                  But waits to tak occatioun by the heale.
               
               
                  Neir to king Roberts camp a Groue their lay
                  Low by a riuers ſide and out of ſight
                  Wheir aiged oaks their branſhed arms diſplay
                  And maks dimm ſhaids with dark and glomie light
                  Heir oft oure prince in ſecret vſt to pray
                  Heir lay the murtherers till on a nicht
                  Doune to this groue the Prince allone deſcended
                  On who is returne a paige without attended
               
               
                  No ſooner mong theſe thickets did he go
                  When he beheld wheir thay had cloiſlie lyen
                  By what intelligence I do not know
                  Or rather reuelatioun moſt diwyne
                  He calls his paige and from his hand does throw
                  A crosbow and a bolt both ſharp and fyne
                  The auntient knight he killeth with the ſame
                  As he vnwar's too raſhlie fordward came,
               
               
                  All armed the vaher tuo in wraith and rage
                  Began him cruellie for to aſſaill
                  But his good ſword did both their wraiths aſſuage
                  And did ſo much againſt them both preuaill
                  Eu'ne then expird the daits of both their aige
                  They in their death diſpaering curſe and raill
                  Againſt their fate and fortuns bad decree
                  Of God who cairles leues ſhall cairles die.
               
               
                  Thus to the camp the Prince returns agane
                  Loud, honord, feard, admird, and praiſd of all
                  When night of day the victorie did gane
                  The Scoutts returnd befoir his feit thay fall
                  Whill in his Regall Tent he did remane
                  Preſenting their a priſoner with all
                  Whoe to this worthie Prince in ſecret ſhoes
                  That he ſhould be aſſailed by his foes,
               
               
                  
                  And how they wold aproche that veray night
                  Vnder thik darknes blak and cloudie vaile
                  And wold aſſault his Camp with ſuddain fight
                  Nor wold ſtrong Trenches noght at all preuaill
                  With fire throune futth their Tents ſhold burne ſo bright
                  Yet could not this his wonted curage quaill
                  But with a glaide and cheirfull countenance
                  He doth inquir what way they wold aduance.
               
               
                  Beyond this riuer ar they yet ſaid he
                  And by a ſecreit foord they pas vnknoune
                  Then quod the Prince heauins oure Protector be
                  As is oure caus ſuch be oure fortons ſhoune
                  Now he commands his captans for to ſie
                  That his ſmall armie from the Camp be drowne
                  And rank't in Battell furth vpone the plane
                  Wheir they in arms muſt all that night remane.
               
               
                  To Guarde the Camp he ſxtie maks to ſtay
                  And brings four hundreth foorth with ſpeir and ſheild
                  With this ſmall armie he wold neids eſſay
                  To force his ſubrill foe to flie or yield
                  And that braue Lord that bears the name of hay
                  He doth creat as Gen'rall of the feild
                  Him ſelf with onlie two wold go and view
                  The foord wheir they ſould pas that wold perſew.
               
               
                  Now doun the Riuer ſide his courſe he bent
                  From whoes ſteip banks heig he crags and rocks ariſe
                  And ſtill he ſeis the farther that he went
                  Heigher the Shoir louer the ſtreame ſtill lyis
                  At laſt wheir as the rocks in two was rent
                  Their nature did a narrow path devviſs
                  So to the Riuer doun or vp might go
                  But one in rank or at the moſt but two
               
               
                  When this braue Prince this ſtrength did well behold
                  Quicklie theſe two that with him thither went
                  He bak derects and prays in haiſt they wold
                  Drow vp the reſt his foes for to preuent
                  For heir quod he oure foes to wsar ſold
                  To die what death we liſt for to inuent

                  Heir will I ſtay till you returne agane.
               
               
                  
                  When they were gone he ſoftlie nerer drew
                  Whill as he hears a noiſe and ratling ſound
                  Which ſtill the longer heard the greater grew
