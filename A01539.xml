            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            The Doctrine deliuered in theVers. 1-9. former Part
of the Psalme, is concerning the powerfull and
potent Kingdome of Christ: the Glory, Greatnesse,
Might, Maiestie, and ample extent whereof,
is in most maiesticall manner, and with a
style no lesse stately described from the first Verse
to the tenth.

and shall howle againe for vexation of spirit.
            
               
               To them it is in part made good for the present.
               Reason 4.
               Prov. 29. 6.
There is a snare, or a cord, saith Salomon, in
the sin of the wicked to strangle their ioy with:
but the righteous sing and are merry. And,

               Vnto it they are exhorted.

            It is matter of much ioy then for a man to be

only. They are not freed from Gods wrath alone,
but they are receiued into speciall grace and

               when men persecute you, and put out your names,

much matter of ioy.
            
               Psal. 149. 5. Gaudeant sancti. 
               Let the Saints therefore reioyce,

the vngodly haue no cause at all to reioyce.
            First, the wicked can haue no true Ioy, because
they haue not Gods Spirit. For trueGal. 5. 22. 
               Ioy is a
fruit and an effect of the Spirit. Now where the
root is not, the fruit cannot be:Potest esse radix sine stipite, stipes sine fructu: sed nec stipos nec fructus sine radice. there may be
a root without a stocke, as whenIob 14. 7, 8. Dan. 4. 14, 15. a tree is hewen
downe, or a bush cut vp; and a stocke without
leafe or fruit, as in winter time; but neither fruit
nor stocke where the root is not. But wicked men
Iude 19. 
               haue not the Spirit. AsRom. 8. 9. 
               they are none of Christs
that haue it not; so none haue it that are not
Christs. And wanting the root therefore, they
cannot haue the fruit, which springing from it,
cannot possibly be without it. For

can be no true ioy, where there is no inward

solid ioy, where there is nothing but disquiet
and distraction, nothing but terror and horrour,
nothing but apprehension and expectation

of wrath. ButIob 15. 20, 21.

sudden flaw or gust of wind, as there doth oft in

men were pleasantly sporting themselues a little
before, there whole ships are now swallowed
vp. The wicked therefore hauing no sound or

ioy.

other.Ester 8. 16.

merry, so long as he remaineth so: His mirth it
is not heartie, it is but strained, or it is but a
meere delusion, a fooles paradise at the most.
There can be no cause in the world therefore of
reioycing to any man, till he be reconciled vnto
God. Because though a man had all the world,
yet could all the world doe him no good,Anne magis ficuli genuerunt aera tyranni?

of ignorance of his owne estate, slumber a while

pleasures; but if he saw his owne estate, if hee
knew his owne plight, he would ratherIam. 5. 1, 2. houle
and weepe euery houre all his life long.
            A second conceit of worldly men,Error 2. is, that
they thinke there is no ioy there, where it is only
to be had: There is no ioy, they thinke, to be
found in the good waies of God. It is the conceit
of many, and it keepeth many backe from
looking that way, that if a man set foot once into
Gods waies, all his ioy is instantly dashed and
lost, all his mirth is marred, he must neuer looke

to liue merry houre after: Whereas indeed it is
cleane contrary.

a good relish to any state or condition, be it neuer
so meane, or, in the eie of the world, neuer
so miserable: whereas the greatest, highest, largest,

without it. Any course of life may be cheerfull
and lightsome with it; none can euer be truly
comfortable or delightfull without it. Godlinesse

this our ioyfull and comfortable estate for the
present depend; and for want of it, many that
haue much cause of ioy and comfort, were they
but aware of it, liue oft times a very heauie and
vncomfortable life; and so are, through their
owne ignorance and default, many times most

miserable, when yet they are indeed, or at least
might be most happie. And when we finde our
selues so depressed and deiected, by meanes of
crosse occurrents, that this alacritie and cheerefulnesse
is ouerwhelmed therewith, labour to
rouse vp our spirits, and say, as Dauid sometime
said;Psal. 42. 5, 11. &amp; 43. 5. 
               Why art thou thus deiected and cast downe,
O my Soule? and why art thou so distracted and
disquieted within me? Trust still in God, and fixe
thy hopes on him, who is the light of thy Countenance,
and thy God. Yea doe as Dauid did, endeuour
at least to doe it: when he was in a great
streit, his Citie sacked and burned, his owne
wiues, and the wiues and children of his followers
caried captiue; and for ought he or they
then knew, all slaine; his owne company also
conspiring to stone him to death; so transported
they were with griefe and passion, each one for
his owne losses; yet amids all these difficulties
it is said of Dauid, that1 Sam. 10. 6. 
               He cheered vp himselfe
in the Lord his God. And so should euery one doe,
that truly and sincerely feareth God, and is carefull
to walke in the obedience of his will; though
he sit in darknesse, saith the Prophet, and haue no
sparke of light, that his outward estate is able to
afford, yetEsai. 50. 10. 
               Let him trust in the Lord, and rest
him on his God; and euen then also endeuour

               to be glad,Motiues 4. and reioyce in his fauour and mercie,
when his present estate seemeth to giue all cause
to the contrarie.
            This the rather Gods Children should striue
and straine themselues vnto; as to attaine, so

at all times to retaine and maintaine this alacritie
and cheerefulnesse in their soules:
            First,Motiue 1. because the want of it is a great enemie
to thankfulnesse.Psal. 33. 1. 
               Reioyce in the Lord yee righteous,
saith the Psalmist; for it becommeth the vpright
to be thankfull: as if they could not be
thankfull, vnlesse they wereBeneficia hilares accipiamus, gaudi

                  . l. 2. c. 22. Gratias agere, gaudentis est. Ibid. l. 3. c. 3. cheerefull. And
certainly we cannot be so thankfull to God as
we should for his fauours, so long as wee haue
no ioy of them, as we take not delight in them.
Yea we are too tooIngrati grati
                     •
                  : uti saepe Augustin. 
               vnthankfull to the grace of
God,
               Motiue 2. and value his goodnesse at too low a
rate, if we suffer any outward thing, what euer
it be, and much more toyes and trifles, matters
of no moment, to depriue vs of the ioy that we
might and should enioy in it.
            
               Secondly, because the want of it is a great hinderance
vnto the performance of good duties.
               Psal. 2. 11. Serue the Lord with feare, saith the Psalmist,
and reioyce before him with reuerence, And when
thou commest to appeare before the Lord thy God
in thy festiuals,
               Deut. 16. 11, 14. 15. See in any case, saith God, that
thou reioyce. And,
               Deut. 28. 47, 48. Because thou wouldest not
serue the Lord thy God, with ioyfulnesse and with
gladnesse of heart, for the abundance of all things:
therefore shalt thou serue thine enemies that he shall
send vpon thee, in hunger, and thirst, and nakednes,
and in want of all things. It is as

all holy duties,Motiue 3. when with hanging of the wings,
and flagging affections, when with drooping,
lumpishnesse, deadnesse and dulnesse we goe about
them.
            
            Thirdly, because it heartneth Gods enemies,
and giueth them occasion of triumph, when
they see Gods children hang the head. Then
Psal. 13. 2. doe Dauids enemies exult ouer him, when they
see him smitten with sorrow, and like one at his
wits end. It is not so much the crosses and calamities
that befall Gods Church and children, as
Fructus contumeliae in sensu &amp; indignatione patientis est. Sen. de constant. sap. c. 17. their taking them too much to heart, and their
heartlesse carriage vnder them, that heartneth
and encourageth the aduerse partie, and giueth
them occasion to triumph. As
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Rom. 8. 37. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . 2 Cor. 2. 14. &amp; 4. 8, 9. Genus ultionis est, eripere ei qui fecit, contumeliae voluptatem. Sen. de const. sap. c. 17. 
               wee triumph
ouer them, though they seeme to preuaile against
vs, when we shew our selues vndaunted and vndismaid,
notwithstanding their extremest rage,
andNempeidcircò aliquis te laedit ut doleas; quia fructꝰ omnis laedentis in dolore lesi est. Ergò cùm fructum ejus everteris non dolendo, ipse doleat necesse est amissione fructus sui. Tertull. de patient. c. 8. nothing vexeth them more, than when
they perceiue that notwithstanding all that euer
they can doe, yet our courage is not quailed: So
on the other side againe it putteth courage into
them, when they perceiue vs to be discouraged,
it ministreth matter of ioy and insultation to
them, when they see vs deiected and disheartned,
and our countenances cast downe, as if we
despaired wholly of diuine, either protection
or deliuerance, and were not only at our wits
end, but at our hopes end also.
            And lastly,Motiue 4. because it disheartneth many
from good courses. AsNum. 13. 31. 
               the Spies that were

sent to view the Land of Canaan, by their cowardise
and faint-heartednesse, brought vp a
slander vpon that good Land that God had promised
to bestow vpon his people, and soNum. 14. 1-4. made
the people that they had no desire to set further
forward toward it, but began to entertaine
thoughts rather of returning backe againe into
Aegypt: So this heauie and vncomfortable state
and cariage of Gods children, causeth religion
and godlinesse to be misdoubted and traduced,
as a most heartlesse and vncomfortable course;
is a meanes to bring an imputation vpon the
good waies of God, as if nothing but melancholy
fits were there to be found, and that sullen
humour were the only predominant in all pious
and religious persons; and so beateth backe
many from setting foot into good courses, that
were comming on before; yea maketh many
call in question, and doubt shrewdly of the truth
of those things that the Spirit of God speaketh
soPsal. 4. 6, 7. &amp; 68. 4, 5. &amp; 89. 15, 16, 17. &amp; 118. 15. Prov. 29. 6. Rō. 5. 2, 3. oft in the Word,Conclusion. concerning the ioy and
comfort of the godly mans estate.
            All which well considered, it standeth vs euerie
one in hand, that are attained to the state of
grace and fauour with God, as wee desire to
shew our selues truly and throughly thankfull
to God for it, and to expresse our thankfulnesse
in such a cheerefull performance of good duties,
as may put life and grace into them, as wee
would be loth to hearten Gods enemies, and
adde courage vnto them, or to dishearten weake
ones, and discourage them from comming on

to him; to take notice of our owne happinesse,
and consider wel what a blessed estate we are in,
and to stir vp our hearts to a ioying in it, in some
measure, proportionably to that matter of ioy
that it ministreth vnto vs; and to take great heed
how we suffer this ioy either to be filched from
vs by any slight of Satan, or to be drowned in
vs by occasion of any outward occurrents.
            And here before we passe from this first Point
of Instruction, it shall not be amisse, to remoue
that imputation that we euen now said is by occasion
of the vncomfortable cariage of some
Christians, cast by many vpon the Profession of
Christianitie in generall; by answering an Obiection
that may be and is oft made against the
Doctrine before deliuered.
            For,Obiection. 
               Ioy the godly mans Portion? may some
man say. Experience plainly disproueth it. We
see none liue more merrily and iouially than
wicked and worldly men doe; none more heauily
and pensiuely than those that make most
conscience of their courses: so that none, it seemeth
haue indeed lesse ioy than the godly.

but wee see not what they feele inwardly.

               The soule only knoweth it owne bitternesse, saith
Salomon: And,Prov. 14. 13. medio de fonte leporum Surgit amari aliquid, quod in ipsis floribus angat. Lucret. l. 4. Hilaritas ficta est: aut gravis &amp; suppurata tristitia. Sen. ep. 80.

               You see all of you what an handsome
shooe this is, said the Romane sometime, but where

their consciences feele inwardly. Their laughter is
neuer better than a light gigling, many times,

Now these men see and obserue the one, but the
other they will not see, because they are willing
to picke a quarrell to Christian profession. To
vse a Comparison, vsed before me byDr Burgesse on Act. 9. 31. a right
reuerend Diuine. Suppose a man come into one
of your shops, and aske to see some wares:
which when he is shewed, he findeth some fault
with; &amp; though you tell him you will shew him
better, yet he refuseth to see them, and so goeth
his way: will you not say that such a one came
not to buy, but to cauill? In like manner, when
men to obiect against piety and godlinesse, as the
mother and meanes of a most vncomfortable
life, shall picke out examples of some few distressed
and disconsolate Christians, that either
oppressed with melancholy, orBona non sua nerunt.-Virg. Georg. l. 2. mistaken
through weaknesse of iudgement in their owne
estates, liue pensiuely, and shall rehuse to take notice
of others many more, ten to one, that liue
cheerefully, and goe on ioyfully with much
comfort and contentment in a religious course
of life; we may well say and deeme of such, that
they deale very vnequally, and are bent to cauill
only at the practise and profession of pietie, because

            2.Answer 2. Are good men, sayest thou, many times
heauie and sad? It is not godlinesse or holinesse

that maketh them so heauie, but the want of it
rather, either in others or in themselues.
            And not to insist long vpon the former, that
the godly are oft heauie, not because they are
themselues holy, but because others,Act. 26. 29. whom
they desire should be so,Rom. 9. 2, 3. are not as themselues
are. It is not their owne holinesse, but thy prophanenesse
that maketh them heauie. As2 Pet. 2. 8. the
bad liues of the Sodomites were an heart-sore to
Lot, andPsal. 119. 136, 158. the wicked courses of Dauids enemies,
a great griefe vnto Dauid.

that others should doe well, but he must needs
be grieued when hee shall see them doe otherwise
than well. They are one maine cause of
their heauinesse, that finde fault with them for it.
They should haue the lesse cause to be heauie,
and it were not for such as they are.
            But to let that passe, it is not so much the light
of their present, as the consideration of their
former estate that maketh good men so sad.
They are not heauie, because they are now holy,
butNeminem pudet, nemimem poenitet, nisi quod plane retrò non fuerit. Tertull. apolog. because they were not sooner such: that
they haue spent, or mis-spent rather so much
time, in an vnholy course of life, which now seeing
their owne folly, they seriously repent of,
and are sincerely sorie for. Or if their griefe arise,
as it may well also, from the sight of the present;
it is because they are no holier than they are.

               The godly, saith one, are not heauie therefore, because

in some respect as they say. So the great loue of
godlinesse, and the greedie desire of it, and that
euen out of the comfort and sweetnesse that
they haue felt and found in it, doth oft so possesse
the hearts and mindes of the godly, that it
withholdeth them from seeing and taking notice
of what they haue, and maketh them many
times pensiue, because they haue so littleQuid enim refert quàm magnum sit, quod tibi minus est. Apul. ibid. as
they imagine, though being more than ordinarily
stored with it, of that which so earnestly
they desire. Nor ought that heauinesse of theirs
therefore be imputed to be holines, which either
the true or supposed want of it produceth. It is
a very vnequall thing, to charge holinesse with
that that vnholinesse is the cause of, and much
more to challenge the godly for that, which
themselues and such as they be, are the cause of.
            3.Answer. 3. Doe some godly men lead a very vncomfortable
life? It is by meanes of their weaknesse
and ignorance of their owne happinesse.
Foelicitatem ipsi suam no intelligunt. Sen. de benef. lib. 2. cap. 27. They iudge not aright of their owne present
estate; they are not yet acquainted with the
voice of Gods Spirit, that speaketh peace and

comfort to their soules. As when men come at
first into a strange countrey, it is some space of
time ere they can vnderstandPsal. 85. 8. the language,
and so come to conuerse familiarly with the
Natiues thereof. So is it with Gods Children
oft for some space of time, after their first conuersion
to God and godlinesse, they vnderstand
not instantly the language of Gods Spirit, which
they haue not beene formerly acquainted with;
nor apprehend they therefore presently those
sweet comforts and ioyes that their present
estate and condition affordeth. It is with them
as with a prisoner or a condemned person, that
though hee haue his pardon signed and sealed,
and newes brought him of it, asGen. 45. 26. 
               Iacob had of
Iosephs life and state, yet doth not beleeue it; or
when the deed it selfe is shewed to him, yet because
he cannot himselfe reade it, or see his owne
name in it, or else because, it may be, he mistaketh
somewhat in it, giueth no credit at all to it,
and so hath no more ioy of it yet, than as if it
were not. And we may adde also, that euen melancholy
is many times a cause of it. For Gods
grace, though it renue and change the disposition
of the soule, yet it altereth not the naturall
constitution of the bodie. Euen the godly therefore,
as they are some of them made of a melancholike
mould as well as others, so are they

                  . Act. 14. 15. Iam. 5. 17. subiect, as well as others, to melancholike passions
and affections? An humour that is wont

and the louely fruits and effects of it, picking

those things, that might giue it best assurance.
That which
                  See Bright of Melanchol. chap. 17. &amp; 34. &amp; 35. the Deuill also taking aduantage
of, is not negligent to worke vpon, and by
meanes thereof, to possesse the minds of such,
with such conceits of themselues, which by reason
of their melancholy, hauing once made a
deepe impression, are not easily againe remoued,
as may vex and turmoile them, and either
make them wearie of Gods waies, or discourage
others from entring into them. And it is vnequall
to ascribe that vnto godlinesse in generall,
that proceedeth from theQuomodo Cicer. de senect. Non est proprium hoc senectutis vitium, sed commune valetudinis. speciall constitution
of some few godly ones only, and is no other
than is common to them, with many other prophane
also, being of the same constitution,
though not in the same condition, that they are.
We see, schollers many, more than others ordinarily,
subiect to melancholy, because their retired
courses of life and priuacie of studie, is a
great meanes to feed that humour where it is
naturally found: yet neither followeth it therefore,
that all Schollers liue vncomfortable liues,
because some doe so, that are possessed and oppressed

with that humour. Nor may that rightly
be ascribed to studie and learning, which not
it, but the constitution of some students produceth.
            4.Answer 4. Doe men liue sometime not so comfortably,
when they begin to grow godly? The vntowardnesse
of their corrupt nature is the cause
of it. It is no maruell if the spirituall breeding
be with some difficultie: especially when we go,
asGen. 25. 22, 23.

trouble and distraction, vntill the better of

fained subiect, that so affecteth them, that it
draweth teares from them, though the thing

acted nothing at all concerne them, nor, it may
be, euer was in truth executed, that they desire
and long exceedingly to see it againe; then they
need not maruell, if Gods Children can take
much more pleasure in this their holy griefe,
though it draw many a teare from them, that so
neerely concerneth them; and in those religious
teares, which are so pleasing to God, that they
causeLuk. 15. 7. 
               much ioy in heauen, and by which2 Cor. 7. 10. so
much benefit accrueth to themselues. They

eternall ioy and delight.
            7Answer 7. Doe not the godly seeme so ioyfull ofttimes
as the wicked? or make so much shew of
mirth outwardly? It followeth not that therefore
they are not as ioyfull, or haue not as much
mirth as they. For the ioy of Gods children, as
the ground of it, is more inward, than outward:
as1 King. 6. 4. Ezech. 40. 16. the windowes that conueyed the light into
Salomons Temple, were wider within, than without
they were.Levium metallorum fructꝰ in summo est: illa opulentissima sunt, quorū in alto latet vena, assiduè plenius responsura f

deepest in the ground. AndSolidū gaudium plus introrsus patet. Ibid. the greatest ioy
many times makes outwardly least shew. As
hypocrites oft-times2 Cor. 5. 12. 
               reioyce in the face, as the
Apostle speaketh, when yet they reioyce not in
the heart; and worldly men many timesSpem vuliu simulat, premit altum corde dolorem. Virg. Aen. l. 1. Rebus affectis hilaritatem de industria 
                     •••
                  ulant, &amp; adversas res adumbrata laetitia abscondunt. Sen. ad Polyb. c. 24. set a
good face on it, and make semblance of mirth
outwardly, when their hearts are inwardly the
whiles pincht with paine: so the godly oft-times
reioyce in the heart, when yet they reioyce not in

the face; (2 Cor. 6. 10. 
               as sorrowing, saith the same Apostle,
and yet alwaies reioycing:) and haue their
soules fraught inwardly with abundance of
ioy, though their lookes outwardly shew it not.
Psal. 45. 13. 
               The Kings daughter, saith the Psalmist, is all glorious
on the inside. As the glory of Gods Church;
so the ioy of Gods children is much, yea or most,
inward: and it is no maruell, therefore, if1 Iohn 3. 2. 
               the
world and worldly men see not either the one or
the other; they want1 Cor. 2. 14. 
               spirituall eyes to discerne
either. They thinke there is no mirth, but where
there is gigling and laughing, or swaggering and
reuelling, and the like. But Gods children may
say to them, as our Sauiour to his Disciples,Iohn 4. 33. 
               I
haue other meat than you wot of; so,Non n

               We haue
other manner of ioy than you are aware of. The
godly are oft merry, though they make little
shew of it: yea their mirth is most many times,
when it is least seene. Those that prescribe rules
for the choice of Simples, aduise to take herbes in
the Spring, flowers in Summer, fruits in Autumne,

               roots in Winter; and why roots for the most
part at that time? Surely because the sap is then
gone downe; it is most in the root, when it is
least in the stocke; it is most of all then vnderground,
when it is least to bee seene aboue
ground. And so it is oft-times with the ioy of
Gods children,Martyr etiam in 
                     •
                  atena gaudet, Gaudebat Crispina, cùm tenebatur, cùm audiebatur, cùm damnabatur, cùm ducebatur. Aug. in Psal. 137. it is most rise many times with
them inwardly in the heart, when least shew of
it appeareth outwardly, or discouereth it selfe in
their life.
            Lastly,Answer 8. Is the ioy of Gods children many

times obscured? or doth it not oft so euidently
appeare outwardly to the eye? It is no maruell.
As we said euen now, It is here oft Winter time
with them. It is so in some sort generally so long
as they liue here. It is Summer here with the wicked,
it is Winter with them.Psal. 37. 2. &amp; 92. 12. Foenea quadam foelicitate temporaliter florent. Aug. epist. 120. c. 5. Gramen hyeme viret, aestate arescit: arbor arescente gramine virescit. Idem in Psal. 36. The one is as the
grasse that is greene in Winter, but withereth when
the heat of Summer once commeth. The other
is as the Oake, that in Winter seemeth seare, but
when Summer commeth sprouteth out, and continueth
fresh and greene then, when the grasse is
parcht and burnt vp, or made hay of.Coloss. 3. 3, 4. 
               You are
now dead, saith the Apostle; and your life is hid
with Christ; but when Christ, who is your life, shall
appeare, then shall you also appeare in glory with
him. As if he had said, It is now Winter time, and
the sap lieth hid in the root with you, but when Summer
commeth, you shall spring out, and be in your
prime as trees and plants are
               Malach. 4. 2. 
               when the Sunne
approacheth.
            
            But more specially it is Winter with them at
some time more than at others. As in times of
affliction, desertion, temptation and persecution.
That is the Winter that in theCant. 2. 11. 
               Canticles
the Spirit specially speaketh of. And no maruell
if ioy and comfort be then oft-times restrained
with them; at least if they doe not then so apparently
offer themselues to outward view. Who
would expect or require leaues or fruit ordinarily
in Winter time from a tree? Not but that
the godly haue euen at such times also good
ground euen for great ioy and much comfort;

howsoeuer they see it not for the present: or but
that they haue many of them many times in many
such cases,2 Cor. 1. 5. &amp; 7. 4. as much ioy and com
                  •
               ort as

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   Psal. 92. 12. &amp; 1. 3. Ierem. 17. 8. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Plut. sympos. problem. l. 8. c. 4. Palmae folia non decidunt. Plin. hist. nat. l. 16. c. 20.

Glycas ann. p. 1. c. 5. like the Palme-tree in that regard, that
keepeth his greene hew continually, and neuer
casteth his leafe all the yeere long. But that then
vsually ioy and comfort is somewhat obscured
with the most, with weake ones especially, who
yet when they are free from such fits, liue as
cheerefully, as ioyfully, as comfortably as
any.
            Such occasions and occurrents then are the
godly subiect vnto now and then, that through
their weaknesse oft disturbe much and dimme
their ioy for a time. And are not worldly men
also subiect to many diseases, disasters, crosses,
griefes, discontentments, that set them oft off
the hinges, and marre all their mirth? It is an
vnequall thing then for them to taxe religion for
that, or to twit the religious with it, which

                  . Simonides apud Plut. de util. ex inim. to
all other courses of life is incident as well as to
it. An vnequall thing for them to require such
an equall tenure of disposition from a Christian
man, in all occurrents and accidents, as no other
is able to exhibite. They mayExigis ut nulli gemitus tormenta sequantur? Acceptoque gravi vulnere flere vetas? Ovid. trist. 5. 1. Nulla flendi major est causa qu

            But to come somewhat neerer home to the
portion of Scripture that we haue in hand.Answer 9. Is not
the ioy of the godly in this life either so full or

so sensible? The Reason is here intimated. It is

                     ••
                  . epist. 72. but Seed-time as yet. And to see to oft-times
there is little difference, though indeed there be
much, betweene an acre of ground that lieth
still vnsowen, and one that is sowen with some
precious seed.
            And so passe wee on to the second Point before
propounded,Consider. 2. how farre forth Gods children
doe euen here partake of this Ioy. They
are not wholly depriued or debarred of it for
the present. For they are incited vnto it,Vers. 12. in the
very next words to my Text. And yet they are
not come to the whole crop neither; it is not
their Haruest-time yet: that is not tillMatth. 13. 39. 
               the
worlds end. Light is sowen for them, saith the
Psalmist.
            
            Whence obserue we, that
            This Life is the religious mans Seed-time.Observ. 3.
            
            Ioy is but sowen for him here.
            AsIam. 3. 18. Gal. 6. 7, 8. 
               the fruit of Righteousnesse; so Light and
Ioy are said here to be sowen.
            
            And that principally for these causes:
            1.Reason 1. Because it is here hidden oft, it is not so
apparent to the eie; it is as
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Chrysost. tom. 6. orat. 42. corne in the ground,
that lieth there vnseene: it is much clouded and
obscured with many crosses and conflicts.
            2.Reason 2. Because it seemeth buried and ouerwhelmed
to some. As
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , &amp;c. Chrysost. ibid. Solo sepulta credit quae sunt credita. an ignorant person, that
knew not the nature of graine, and the efficacie
that is in seed, would thinke it were not sowen,
but buried and cast away, when it is cast into the
ground, and laid vp in the earth.
            
               
3.Reason 3. Because it is not yet come to his height
and full growth, or to that increase that it will
come vnto. The graine may sprout in the
ground, butTerra nunquam sine usura reddit quod accepit. Cicde senect. that is nothing in comparison to
that that it is expected to come vnto.
            4.Reason 4. Because it is euen here a breeding, and in
time it will breake forth, spring out, shoot vp;
yea soPsal. 112. 4. Est. 8. 16. it doth also here; and in due time produce
and bring forth a plentifull Haruest. For,
Psal. 126. 5. Non spes solùm fructus, sed &amp; fructus est ipse in semine. Bern. in Psal. 90. serm. 17. 
               Those that sow in teares, saith the Psalmist, shall
reape in ioy. And where this seed of Light and Ioy
is now sowen, a further larger crop of it shall
there sometime succeed.
            The consideration whereof may serue;Vses 4.
            
            First,Vse 1. to admonish Gods children not to be
dismaid and discouraged,Admonition. or to grow discontent,
if they cannot find and feele yet that large
measure of spirituall ioy and comfort, that they
desire, and expected, yea and in the word of
God is oft promised. It is but our Seed-time
yet. And would we haue Seed-time and Haruest
concurre? No,Iam. 5. 7. 
               Behold the Husbandman, saith
Saint Iames, how hee waiteth fon the pretious fruit
of the earth; and expecteth patiently till
               Zech. 10. 1. 
               the first
and latter raine be passed on it. And in like manner
must wee haue patience till Gods Haruest-time
come, and then shall wee be sure to haue
our full crop, whatsoeuer it please God to impart
vnto vs of it before; in the meane while
looking constantly after the spirituallDeut. 32. 2. Hebr. 6. 7. 
               raine
of the Word, and praying instantly for the sweet
dewes of his Spirit, to descend downe vpon our

soules, for the cherishing and improuing of this
seed of ioy sowen in vs. When we haue laid our
graine into the ground, we doe not looke to see
it the same day againe, much lesse to reape the
same day, (as he saith of the Hyperborean people
farre North, thatHeresbach. de re rust. they sow shortly after the
Sunne rising with them, and reape before the
Sunne set, that is because the whole halfe yeere
is one continuall day with them:) no, wee expect
not the next day, nor the next weeke neither,
to see it againe aboue ground; but we are
content to wait patiently till the yeere come about;
and are glad when wee see it but after a
month it may be, beginne to peepe out of the
ground, liuing in hope stil of the further growth
of it, and to enioy at length, after the spire and
the blade, a full eare. So must we learne likewise
herein patiently to wait Gods good leisure, and
though wee see a long time but slender growth,
scarce any sight at all of it, yet not to be dismaid
therefore or discouraged, butSpes alit agricolas: spes sulcis credil aratis Semina, quae magno samore reddit ager. Tibull. 2. 6. 
               liue in hope, as
the Husband-man doth, of further increase of
it, and of a full crop at length, when God shall
see it good. And the rather by much may wee
liue in hope, andRom. 4. 24. -credula vitam Spes fevet. - Tibull. ibid. 
               liue by hope here than there,
because the seed that is there sowen, after it is so
sowen may miscary; it may be cast into the
ground, and die there, and so neuer come vp againe:
(Ioel 1. 17. 
               The graine, saith Ioel, is rotted vnder
the clods:) it may spring vp well, andExod. 9 31. be blasted,
while it is yet in the blade: it may be eared,
and yet perish ere it come to be cut:Ioel 1. 5, 16. - s

glad is the Husbandman when hee hath had a

crop secured? This should therefore serue againe
to incite and stirre vp all Gods Children,
to constant and continuall ioy and reioycing,
hauing so sound a seed of ioy sowen in them,
and being so sure of a large and plentifull crop
of it: to say with the blessed Virgin,

as Gods Church and Children are daily
vexed and annoyed with, yea and our selues
also among the rest? Or how can wee reioyce,
when we haue so many sinnes and corruptions
to be sory for? Yea, how may we lawfully reioyce,
whenEsai. 22. 12. we are called vnto heauinesse and
solemne humiliation, when we are commanded
and enioyned by God, to mourne and lament?
When either our owne estate or Gods Churches
is such, thatAmos 6. 6. See the Sparke. not to be sorie, and to be euen
sicke with sorrow, may well seeme a sinne?
            To this I answer:
            1.Answer 1. We must euer remember so to keepe one
Commandement, that we breake not another.
Matth. 4. 17. Mark. 1. 14. 
               Repent, is one Commandement;Matth. 5. 12. Luke 10. 20. 
               Reioyce,
is another. And he that commandeth the one,
hath enioyned also the other. As Saint Iames
therefore reasoneth,Iam. 2. 11. 
               Hee that said, Thou shalt
not kill, hath said also, Thou shalt not commit adulterie;
though thou doest not kill therefore, yet if thou
doe commit adultery, thou art a transgressor. So
here, he that hath commanded vs to be sory for
our sinnes, and for the afflictions of our brethren,
hath commanded vs also1 Thess. 5. 16. 
               euermore to
reioyce. And therefore though wee faile not in
sorrow for our sinnes, or for our brethrens afflictions,
yet if we wilfully banish and abandon
this spirituall ioy which Gods Spirit requireth
of vs, we make our selues thereby guiltie of sin
in Gods sight. A sinne it may be1 C

                  r. 5. 2. 
               not to be sory
at some time: and a sinne it is for Gods Childe

at any time not to ioy. They say thatPraecepta negativa ligant semper &amp; ad semper. Affirmativa semper, sed non ad semper. Thō. Aquin. sum. p. 1•. 2.

a Christian mans ioy,
               Continuum vult esse &amp; nō interruptum gaudium nostrum. Gilbert. in Cant. 10. admitteth no intermission,
but tieth vnto all times. Sorrow may
be sometime out of season: this spirituall ioy, as of
some food wee say, is neuer vnseasonable. The
godly are at some timesNehem. 8. 9, 10. prohibited the one:
they are neuer inhibited, but enioyned euer the
other. Yea marke what I say; it is vndoubtedly
true: Albeit few be prone to offend that way,
yet a man may offend euen in excessiue sorrow
for sinne, in thinking too much on his sinnes, in
mourning vnmeasurably for his sinnes. If such
thy meditation of thy sinne, and sorrow for thy
sinne shall so farre preuaile with thee, that thou

            2.Answer 2. 
               Ioy and griefe, in some degree at least, may
well stand together. As true ioy may well stand
with some feare.
               Psal. 2. 11. Sic Matth. 28. 8. 
               Reioyce before him, saith the
Psalmist, with feare. SoHabemus luctum gaudio mixtū. Petr. Martyr. in 2 Sam. 24. true ioy may well stand
with some griefe.
               2 Cor. 6. 10. 
               As sorrowing, saith the Apostle,
and yet alwaies reioycing. He that hath commanded
vs to sorrow sometime, would neuer
else haue enioyned vsPhilip. 4. 4. 
               at all times to reioyce.
There is ioy euen in griefe; as there is griefe euen
in ioy. Yea, though it may seeme strange, yet it

is questionlesse true, the greater griefe sometime
the greater ioy; and the greater ioy, the greater
griefe. A man may at the same time both be exceeding
sory for his sinne, and yet reioyce exceedingly
in the apprehension of Gods mercie,
in the free pardon and forgiuenesse of it. Yea,
the greater griefe a man hath for his sinnes, the
more cause of ioy hee hath euen in that regard.
And the greater ioy a man hath in the apprehension
of Gods fauour in the forgiuenesse of his
sinne, the greater griefe and sorrow for his sinne
it vsually worketh in him. As where1 Iohn 4. 18. 
               the seruile
feare ceaseth, that regardeth nothing but
wrath, there the filiall
               Hosh. 3. 5. Timor ne pecces. Aliud est enim timere quia peccaveris; aliud timere ne pecces. Philip. in Iob. 
               feare of offending groweth
vsually most rife: For1 Iohn 4. 19. the more a man is
assured of Gods loue towards him, the more he
loueth God; andGenes. 39. 9. Psal 97. 10. Prov 8. 13. Absit enim ut timore p
                     •
                  reat amor, si castus est timor. Aug. in Psal. 118. Nemo melius diligit, quàm qui maximè veretur offendere. Salvian. ep. 4. the more he loueth him, the
more afraid is he of offending him: SoCessat horror, crescit dolor. 
               where
the inward gals cease of a guiltie conscience, there
sincere griefe for sinne groweth fresher than euer
before. To illustrate this by some familiar comparison.
Suppose one that stood guiltie of high
Treason against his Soueraigne, and that not in

his Sonne, but by a malitious traine taken away
the life of his only Sonne that should haue succeeded

and hauing been arraigned and condemned
for the same, yet should by his Soueraigne

out of his gratious disposition, and at the earnest
suit of some about him, haue the fact pardoned
him, and his pardon sent him. This partie
doubtlesse, as he could not but exceedingly reioyce
in so vndeserued, in so vnexpected a fauour;
so withall, if he had any sparke of grace
or good nature at all in him, the very apprehension
of his Soueraignes gratious disposition,
would make him mourne for his foule fact
more than euer before, considering with himselfe
how wretchedly and vnworthily hee had
caried himselfe toward one whom he found so
gratiously, beyond and aboue all, either expectation
or imagination, disposed. The case is ours
in effect: and not to insist long vpon application
of it: It may hereby plainly appeare, how spirituall
ioy, may well stand with godly griefe, and these
two affections that seeme the one contrary to
the other, may yet agree well together in a Christian
mans soule: since that the more a man ioyeth
in the assurance of Gods goodnesse toward
him, the more he must needs grieue to consider
how by his wicked and rebellious courses, hee
hath demeaned himselfe wretchedly and vnworthily
toward that God, whom he findeth so
gratiously affected toward him.

yet reioyce in Gods mercie; be sorie for his transgression,
and yet haue ioy of his pardon. And
in like manner may he be grieued heartily for the
present afflictions of Ioseph, and that euen so as
hee may be sicke with griefe againe; and yet

withall be cheered and comforted in the consideration
of that happie issue of them, thatVers. 8, 10.

Christian mans ioy dependeth not vpon freedome
from afflictions, butRom. 5. 1, 2, 3. vpon the assurance
of Gods fauour towards him for the present,
and vpon his hopes of future matters. Yea they
may draw matter of ioy from them: Since they
doe, or may know that they are good for them,

the afflictions that befall them are such, as tend
directly to giue them the greater assurance of
their future eternall happinesse. As the Apostle
telleth the Philippians, ThatPhilip. 1. 19.

euidently shew that God had vouchsafed them a
part in that Kingdome, for which he had called them
in such sort to suffer: and that2 Thess. 1. 7.

               This is a true and a sure assertion,
saith the same Apostle, that if we die with Christ,
we shall liue with him; if wee suffer for him, wee
shall reigne with him. And why may not Gods
Children reioyce then, euen in their greatest afflictions,
when they shall consider that2 Cor. 4. 17.

               it is not of that might that it is able to ouerwhelme,
or to quench the least light in the world.
For we see that
               Sidera nocte unicant. Ovid. met. l. 7. Stellas coeli non extinguit nox. Ex Aug. Prosper▪ sent. 120. 
               the darker the Night is, the clearer
the Stars shine: Yea the least
               2 Pet. 1. 19. 
               candles light that
is lighted, withstandeth the whole night, and not only
suffereth not the darknesse to couer, or to smother
ano oppresse it, but it giueth light also euen in the
middest of the darknesse, and beateth it backe for
some space and distance on euery side of it: So that
which way soeuer it is borne, or wheresoeuer it commeth,
there must darknesse depart and giue place

vnto the light; all the power and the dreadfulnesse
of it, cannot helpe or preuaile ought against it. And
though the Light be so weake, that it cannot cast light
far about, or driue the darknesse far from it, as in
the sparke of an hot coale, yet cannot the darknesse couer
or conceale, and much lesse quench it; but it giueth
light to it selfe alone at least, so that it may be
seene a far off in the darke; and it remaineth vnconquered
of the darke, though it cannot helpe other
things, nor giue light vnto them. Yea (that that is yet
more wonderfull)

               a rotten shining peece of wood,
which hath the faintest light that can be found, yet
remaineth inuincible of all the power of darknesse;
and the more it is compassed about with darknesse,
the clearer light it giueth. So little is darknesse able
to ouercome or keepe downe any light; but that it ruleth,
and vanquisheth, and expelleth the darknesse,
which else ouerwhelmeth, and suareth, and fettereth
and putteth all things in feare. Now if this Naturall
Light, but

lay on his death-bed, amids grieuous torments
from the Strangury, that then held him, and inward
Vlcers, professed (if a man might haue
beleeued him) that he then liued the happiest life
that euer he did. Now to reason, as the Heathen
man himselfe hence doth:Quare haec incredibilia sunt apud cos qui virtutem colunt, cùm apud eos quoque reperiantur, apud quos voluptas imperat? Sen. epist. 92. If, saith he, such
things be found among those with whom pleasure
reigneth, why should they seeme incredible
with those that follow Vertue?

stiffenesse of minde, that lasteth vsually but for a

should not Vertue, well grounded, that is wont
to bee constant in her courses, enable others
much more to as much? So, we may well say;

            4. There is no time,Answer 4. no state whatsoeuer,
wherein the godly man hath not great cause of
ioy. It were vnreasonable to require such incessant
ioy of such euermore and at all times, had not
such at all times good reason to reioyce.1 Thess. 5. 16. 
               Reioyce
euermore, saith the Apostle: and,1 Thess. 5. 18. 
               In all
things giue thanks. And surely, if we ought, as the
same Apostle else-where saith,Ephes. 5. 20. 
               At all times and
in all things to be thankfull; then questionlesse we
ought at all times and in al things to be ioyful, as wel
in aduersitie, as in prosperitie, as well in afflictions,
as in freedome from them, as well when
things fall our crosse, as when it fareth with vs as
we would. The godly man then hath at al times
good &amp; iust cause of ioy: it is apparēt. For,

                   Greg. Naz. ep. 62. 
               Gods
iniunctions are not vnreasonable. But I goe a step
further, and dare be bold to auerre it, that euery
righteous man, euery one that is truly religious,
hath at all times, if he could himselfe see it and
apprehend it, much more matter of ioy, than he
hath of griefe, or can haue. For what doth or

can minister more matter of griefe, than Gods
fauour and loue in Christ may afford matter of
ioy? And those therefore that are euer in the fauour
of God, (what should I need to adde; and
that liue in hope of eternall glory with God?)
can at no time haue so great cause of griefe, but
that they haue euen at the selfe-same time much
more cause of ioy. But euery godly man is euer
in fauour with God:Hut illud Sen. ep. 59. Doc

as to apprehend it, more ample matter of ioy
by much than of griefe.

all right thereunto and interest therein, all dissemblers,

not in the heart;

the ground of it and the right to it, to all that are

afford a share and a portion in it as well to those
that are sincerely righteous on earth, as to those
that are perfectly righteous in heauen.
            It is as a key to let in the one;
            It is as a bolt to spar and barre out the other.
            To cleare this further by a distinction or two
of Bernards and Ambrose.
            
            There are six either sorts or degrees of Iustice
or Righteousnesse.
            
            1. Ficta, sed non recta: fained or counterfeit
Righteousnesse, but not sincere or sound. Such as
               Matth. 23. 27, 28. Ficta, fucata, non vera, sincera. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

               the Pharisies was.
               Multi hominibus justi videntur, pauci Deo. Aliter enim hominibus, &amp; aliter Deo. Hominibus secundum externam speciem &amp; faciem: Deo sec. internam veritatem &amp; virtutem. Ambr. in Luc. 1. 6. A righteousnesse in outward
shew and semblance, but not in inward truth
and substance. Like
               
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

metall, and is therefore nought worth.

a mixture in them, as of Light and Darknesse,

obscure and dimme colour: it is transparent and
giueth good, but not cleare and pure light. And
Nostra, si qua est, humilis justitia recta forsitan, sed non pura: quomodo. n. pura, ubi non potest deesse culpa? Idem de temp. 104. such is the righteousnesse of all faithfull persons
while they liue here.

               Pura, sed non firma: A righteousnesse pure
and perfect, but not firme &amp; permanent. Such was
the Righteousnesse of our first Parents before their
fall.Nam primi hominis in initio non mod

God create them:Pura, non firma. they had no sense at first of any
euill motion at all in them, much lesse did
they yeeld or giue any consent to any such. But

beene, if they would:) forEccles. 7. 29. they changed
wilfully that estate that God created them in,
and so fell away from that their originall Righteousnesse.
            
            4.Sort 4. 
               Firma, sed finita: A righteousnesse not pure
only,
               Firma, sed finita. but firme too, yet finite: Such isMat. 25▪ 31. 1 Tim. 5. 21. Apud Angelos recta, pura, &amp; firma, sublimis, sed divina tamen inferior. A Deo collata, nō ipsis innata. Iusti ex eo, nō corā eo; munere ejus, nō in cōparatione ejus.

               of the desire, studie, endeuour, and imperfect
practise, rather than perfection of righteousnesse:
Such as sincerely desire to feare, and to serue God;
and endeuour constantly to doe his will: as haue
respect to Gods Commandements: and thinke vpon
them to obserue them: though they cannot keepe
or fulfill them so as they should: that follow
after righteousnesse, as a worke-man doth his
trade, that he hath bound himselfe an apprentice
to, though he be not yet his crafts-master: And
soIob 1. 1. 
               Iob is said to be Iust, though he had his infirmities
and failings, by his owne confession,
Iob 9. 3. not a few. SoLuk. 1. 6. 
               Zacharie and Elizabeth are
said to haue beene righteous in Gods sight; that is,
truly and sincerely, though not perfectly, righteous:
for they wereLuk. 1. 20. Vide Aug. ad 2. Epist. Pelag. l. 4. c. 7. not also without their
wants. And euen these latter also haue right to,
and may haue part in the ioy here propounded
as well as the former, though the former enioy
it farre more fully than they doe. For,2 Chron. 30. 18, 19. 
               God
will be mercifull, yea he hath alreadie beene, and
is mercifull, to those that set their hearts aright, &amp;
               Nehem. 1. 11. 
               that desire to feare his name. And,1 Chron 28. 7. 
               I will be
with him, saith God of Salomon, if he endeuour to
doe my will. And,Psal. 119. 6. 
               Then, saith Dauid, shall I not
be confounded, when I haue respect to all thy Precepts:
&amp;Psal. 22. 23. 
               When I am vpright with my God. And,
Psal. 103. 17, 18. 
               The louing kindnesse of the Lord is from euer and
for euer, vpon those that thinke vpon his Commandements
to do them. And,Prov. 21. 21. 
               He that followeth after
Righteousnesse shall finde Honour and Life; true
honour and eternal Life. ForRom. 2. 8. 
               vnto those that by

patient perseuerance in well-doing seeke honour,
and glory, and immortalitie, will God render Life
eternall.
            
            And therefore to such also, euen in expresse
tearmes is ioy promised; and such also in expresse
tearmes are enioyned to reioyce.Psal. 64. 10. 
               The
righteous shall be glad in the Lord, and trust in him;
and all (without exception) that are vpright in
heart, shall reioyce. And as here, Light is sowen
for the righteous; so else-where,Psal. 112. 4. 
               Light in darknesse
ariseth to the vpright. And againe, hauing
in the beginning of the Psalme pronounced
them blessed, not that neuer sinned, butPsal. 32. 2. 
               that
haue sincerely repented them of their sinnes; in
whose soule there is no guile: he concludeth with
an incitement, yea an iniunction laid vpon all
such to reioyce:Psal. 32. 11. 
               Be glad, yee righteous, and reioyce
in the Lord; and be merry, yea shout for ioy, all
yee that are vpright in heart.
               Reason 4. And if there be
Luk. 15. 7. 
               great ioy in heauen for such;
               Reason 1. sure there may
well be much ioy also here on earth vnto such.
            And this may be further confirmed vnto vs,
if we shall consider:
            1. That it is not so much the quantitie, as the
qualitie and sinceritie of his grace in vs that God
principally regardeth.Melius est pallens aurū quàm fulgens aurichalcum. Bern. in Cant. 61.

not, what infirmitie, but what disease almost is
there so loathsome, as will keepe a mother from
tendering and tending her childe? In like manner
is it with our heauenly Father, whose loue
and affection to his goeth infinitely beyond the
loue and affection of any earthly father or mother
whatsoeuer. For,Psal. 103. 13. 
               as a Father, saith the
Psalmist, is pitifull vnto his children; so is the Lord
pitifull to those that feare him. AndEsai. 49. 15. 
               the most
naturall mother, the kindest and tenderest parent
that is, may sooner forget or not regard the fruit of
her owne bodie, than hee can forget or not regard
them. And,Malac. 3. 17. 
               I will spare them, saith hee, that
feare me, and thinke on my name, as a man spareth
his owne Sonne that serueth him. Hee loueth and

ForPsal. 147. 11. 
               the Lords delight is in all those that feare
him, and that rely vpon his mercy. Hee is content
to accept of at their hands what they are able.
As a little done by a Son, giueth his Father much
better contentment, than a great deale more
done by a meere stranger or a seruant. And there
is the difference betweene a Sonne and a Seruant;
that a Seruant if he cannot do his Masters work,
1 Sam. 30. 13. his Master will not keepe him, hee must goe

seeke him some other seruice; whereas a Sonne,
albeit he be not able to doe ought, yetIohn 8. 35. hee is
not therefore cast off; his Father keepeth him
not for the seruice that he doth or can doe him,
but he keepeth him because he is his Son. Yea
it is not the wants and infirmities and imperfections,
or the remainders of sinne and corruption
in Gods children, that can cause God to
cast them off or to abhorre them.Peccata nobis nō nocent, si non placent. Aug. de temp. 181. Et apud Ioan. de Tambac. in consol. Theolog.

alreadie before-hand, for the better assurance of
what is to follow.2 Cor. 1. 20. 
               All the promises of God are
in Christ, Yea and Amen, that is, firme and stable,
saith the Apostle. And,2 Cor. 1. 21, 22. 
               It is God that establisheth

               this holy Spirit of Promise,
wherewith we are anointed and sealed, is the earnest
of the inheritance by Christ purchased for vs, for assurance
of possession. As a peny therefore giuen in
earnest bindeth as firmely as a pound; if the partie
at least be a sure and sufficient man that one

to the faithfull in generall, to those that haue receiued
it in particular; and may as well therefore

assurance of the performance thereof vnto them
in due time. And as a weake, but a true Faith,
may as well lay hold vpon Christ, and receiue

and discried amids a multitude of wants, may as
well giue assurance both of present grace and

Gold that such a poore sicke mans weake hand

not so much what we haue alreadie, as what wee
               Rom. 5. 2. &amp; 12, 12. 
               hope for, and shall haue: though a peece of
gold be better worth, and a man therefore may
doe more good with it, than he can with a small
peece of siluer, yet the latter may altogether ioy
a man as much as the former, in regard of the inheritance
that is assured vnto him by either: So
a poore quantitie of Grace, though it cannot for
the present so much benefit a man, either to doe
so much good to him, or to others by him, as a
richer &amp; larger portion of grace may; yet in regard
of the heauenly inheritance and future glory,
that it is an earnest of, the one may well minister
as much ioy as the other, because the one giueth
good assurance of the very selfe-same in effect
and substance with the other.

walke in the light of thy Countenance, O Lord: such
may indeed continually reioyce in thy Name. But the
Hypocrite as he cannot delight in God, so he can
haue no list to come into Gods sight, much lesse
to walke before him, or in the light of his face, as
those doe, and well may, that are vpright. For

               how can the Hypocrite, saith Iob, delight himselfe
in the All-sufficient? Or what heart can he haue at
all times to call vpon God? Or consequently to
depend vpon him? And againe,Iob 13. 15, 16. 
               Though God
slay me, yet will I trust in him; and I will approue
my waies in his sight: (to wit, for the integritie,
for the sinceritie of them:) And hee shall be my

Sauiour and my saluation; when the hypocrite shall
not dare to appeare in his presence. And indeed
with what confidence can any hypocrite appeare
before God, when though he may delude
man, yet he cannot beguile God? For1 Sam. 16. 7.

they doe is most loathsome and abominable in
Gods sight? When all their masked deuotion is
so farre from pacifying Gods wrath, that it is
but a meanes rather to aggrauate and exasperate
it against them? ForIob 36. 13. Nem

Elihu, doe but heape vp and increase wrath. What
ioy can the hypocrite then haue to come into
that light,Ephes. 5. 13. Iohn 3. 19, 20. that discouereth his hypocrisie, that
laieth open his deceit?Iob. 24. 16, 17. 
               The light, saith Iob, is as
the shadow of Death to such. Or what assurance
can hypocrisie giue of Gods fauour, when there
is nothing that doth more than it procure his
displeasure?Matth. 24. 51. 
               His Lord will giue him his portion
with hypocrites, saith our Sauiour, when he would
intimate that such an one should most seuerely
be punished.
            3.Reason 3. Is righteousnesse the root of ioy?
               Rom. 14. 17. 
               Righteousnesse,
and peace, and ioy, saith the Apostle. And
doth ioy spring from righteousnesse? Then can
the hypocrice haue no true ioy, because he hath
no true righteousnesse. For as counterfeit coine
is no coine; nor will in payment goe as current
for the procuring of ought to him that hath it;

so counterfeit righteousnesse is in deed and
truth no righteousnesse, nor will to any good
purpose stand him that hath it in stead. Yea as
Rom. 10. 3. Apoc. 3. 17.

share in Gods wrath. AndMalus ubi bonum se simulat, tunc est pessimus. P. Syr. Apertè quando malus est, tunc est optimus. Nam, Bonitatis verba imnari major est malitia. Idem. 
               a wicked man,
saith the Heathen man, is then worst when he
seemeth best; hee is neuer worse than when
hee maketh shew to bee that which hee is
not. If there can bee no sound reioycing
then, where righteousnesse is not; no hypocrite
being most vnrighteous can euer soundly reioyce.Vse.

            And againe on the other side, many thinke
they haue not that which indeed they haue. For

               a man may haue grace, and yet not know that hee
hath it; (as the Embruo or the Infant in the
wombe hath life, and yet knoweth not that it liueth;)
yea hee may thinke that he hath it not.
As we seeke sometime for keyes, when they are
in our pocket: and
                  Hayward, Strong Helper, chap. 22. As we are said to haue lost a thing, when wee know not where it is, though it be safe still in our owne custodie. we thinke that we haue lost
some jewell, when we haue it safe looked vp in
our chest, or in our deske; yea or as the Butcher
looketh about him for the candle that sticketh
in his hat, and he carrieth about with him on his
head, and seeketh it by the light of that which he
seeketh, as if hee had it not about him, not remembring
suddenly where he stucke it. So the
godly are oft in their owne conceit at a losse,
when yet that they deeme lost is still sure and
safe; they misse many times Gods grace in them,
and seeke for this grace by the light of the same
grace, which yet they see not in themselues.
And this is another wile of the Deuill, whereby
he laboureth to delude such, by calling in question

their great discomfort to doubt of it, by perswading
them that they are out of Gods way,
when they are indeed in it; and out of fauour
with God, when they are as much in fauour
with him as any; that so either he may, if it be
possible, make them grow desperate and carelesse;
or else that he may make the way to the

            That both sinceritie therfore may be discerned,
and hypocrisie discouered, to the consolation of the
one, and the confusion of the other: it shall not
be amisse here to annex some Notes,
               Notes of Sinceritie. whereby
those that desire to be truly informed of their
estate, may be able to iudge of their owne sinceritie,
and of the vprightnesse of their heart.
            The first Note then of Sinceritie may be Vniuersalitie:
               Note 1. Vniuersalitie.
when our repentance and obedience is
not partiall but generall, when we are carefull to
shunne, not one or two only, this or that sinne,
but all knowne sinne whatsoeuer, and to endeuour
our selues to walke in all the good waies of
God, without exception of any. So it is said of
Iosias, that2 King. 23. 25. 
               hee turned vnto God with all his
heart, all his soule, all his minde and his might, according
to all that was contained in the Law. And
so saith Dauid of himselfe,Psal. 119. 101. 
               I haue refrained my
feet, not from one or two, but from euery euill

way, that I might keepe thy Statutes. And,Psal. 119. 6. 
               Then
shall I not be confounded, when I haue respect vnto
all thy Precepts. And,Psal. 119. 128. 
               Therefore doe I esteeme
all thy Precepts concerning all things to be right; and
euery wrong way doe I euen abhorre. And hereby
doth he approue vnto God his sincerity and the
vprightnesse of his heart with God.Psal. 18. 21, 22, 23. 
               I haue
kept the waies of God, and haue not wickedly gone
away from my God. For all his Commandements
were before mee, and I put not any of his Statutes
wilfully away from me: But was vpright before
him, and kept my selfe from mine owne sinne. And
of Zacharie and Elizabeth it is said,Luk. 1. 6. 
               They were
righteous in Gods sight, walking blamelesly in all
Gods Commandements and Ordinances. For as it is
said of Vices,

man, is free from no fault.

               The whole Law,

The Law for the sanction indeed is disiunctiue;
               
for the Iniunction it is Copulatiue. The sanction
runneth in the Disiunctiue,

saith our Sauiour to the Pharisees,
               Matth. 23. 23. 
               These things
ought yee to haue done, and not to haue left the other
vndone. Now it is a Rule in the Art of Reasoning,
thatIn omni conjuncto, sive copulato, si unis est mendacium, etiamsi vera sint caetera, tota esse mendacuim dicitur. Ex omnibus verò quae disiunguntur, unum esse verum sufficit. Gell. noct. Attic. l. 16. c. 8. Verum enunciati copulati judicium pendet ex omniū partium veritate; falsum saliē ex una parte falsa. Ram. dialect. l. 2. c. 5. 
               in a Disiunctiue, if any one part hold, the
whole is held to be true; in the Copulatiue, if any
one part hold not, the whole is held to be vntrue.
So in a Disiunctiue Iniunction, if a man performe
the one part, he is freed thereby from the
other; the Woman that was enioyned to bring
for her Purification
               Levit. 12. 8. Luk. 2. 14. 
               a paire either of Turtles, or
of Pigeons, was thereby bound to bring the one
only, shee needed not to bring both: and in the
legall sanction,
               Ezek. 21. 11. Galat. 3. 12. hee that doth, dieth not,
               Deut. 27. 27. hee
that dieth doth not; for no man is thereby bound
to both, both to doe, and to die, to doe the one, and
yet to endure also the other. But in a Copulatiue
Iniunction it is far otherwise;Delinquens in parte, in totum reus est. Regula generalis, Gloss. ad Digest. l. 29. tit. 5. l. 3. Si quis unū custodiat, &amp; reliqua praevaricetur, nihil ei prodest. Amb. in Psal. 118. serm. 13. &amp; Hesych. in Levit. l. 4. c. 13. nothing is done

The reason that the Apostle addeth there is
indeed very forcible. It isIam, 2. 11. the same God that
enacted and deliuered the whole Law, that hath

enioyned one good dutie as well as another,
hath inhibited one sinfull act as well as another.
If a man therefore for Conscience of Gods will
and word, doe exercise himselfe in any one good
dutie, he will consequently exercise himselfe in
all other good duties that concerne him; because
the same God in his Word hath alike enioyned all.
If for Conscience of Gods will and Word he forbeare
or abhorre any one sinne,

and abhorre all other Sinnes; because the
sa
                  •
               e God in his Word hath alike forbidden all.
And on the contrarie therefore, hee that doth
not either exercise himselfe in euery knowne
dutie that concerneth him of the one sort, or is
not carefull to shunne euery kinde of euill act of
the other sort, doth not either obserue ought in
the one kinde, or eschew ought in the other
kinde, out of any true care or conscience of his
dutie and obedience to God, but for some other
by-ends and by-respects. It is a good Rule in
the Schooles,
               Vbi unū aliquod peccatu remittitur, ibi omnia remittuntur. Impossibile est unum sine aliis remitti. Thom. Aquin. sum. p. 3. q. 86. a. 3. 
               Hee that hath any one sinne remitted,
hath all sinnes remitted: And so,Peccata quamuis non sint connexa quantum ad conversionem ad bonū commutabile, sunt tamen quantum ad aversionem à bono incommutabili: &amp; in hac parte habent rationem offensae, quam per poenitentiam oportet tolli. Aquin. ibid. 
               He that
hath sincerely repented of any one sinne, hath repented
him of all. And he that hath not repented him of
all knowne sinne, hath not repented yet of any. For
what is true Repentance, butEzek. 18. 21, 27, 28, 30, 32. &amp; 33. 11. 
               a returning againe
into the right way? And how is it possible for a
man to returne into the right way,Psal. 119. 101.

                   passim Palantes error recto de tramite pellit. Horat. serm. l. 2. sat. 3. as long as
he wandereth still in any by-path? Or how can
a man repent of this or that particular sinne, because
it is contrarie to Gods will, or offensiue in

his sight, but hee must needs withall repent him
of whatsoeuer he knoweth to be in like manner
a breach of his Law, and a businesse that he abhorreth?
Nor doth that man indeed studie sincerely
and out of a loue of God to please him in

prayeth in the behalfe of the Colossians, endeuour
and striueColoss. 1. 10.

that he may please the Lord in all things,

               He doth

that doth it no further than himselfe will: that
doth not by labouring with the Apostle Paul, to
keepe“Hebr. 13. 18.

               endeuour
to approue himselfe and his courses vnto God, as wel
in some things as in others. This Vniuersalitie
therefore of care and endeuour is a good Argument
of Sinceritie. As on the other side it is a
shrewd signe of vnsoundnesse and insinceritie,
               Sciendum quia quisquis virtute aliqua pollere creditur, tunc veraciter pollet, cum vitijs ex aliqua parte non subjacet. Greg. m
                     •
                  r. l. 21. c. 1. when men will seeme to make conscience of
performance of some good duties, and yet are
wholly carelesse and regardlesse of others: or
when they will seeme to make conscience of
the forbearance of some sinnes, and yet lie and
liue in the ordinary practise of others, which yet
they cannot be so ignorant as not to know, or so
vnmindful, as not to consider to be sinnes. Thus
was Herods hypocrisie detected and discouered.
He stood in some awe of Iohn, knowing him to
be a very holy man: and because hee would be
esteemed religious, and would seeme to respect
him,Mark. 6. 20. 
               he heard him oft, and at his motion did
many good things: yea and it is like enough that

hee outwardly reformed many things amisse,
that Iohn found fault with, either in his Court,
or in himselfe. But yet hee would not leaue the
keeping of his Brothers wife for all that; and
thereforeMark. 6. 17. when Iohn began to deale plainly
with him in that point, he then brake off all, and
committed Iohn toward; and made it euidently
appeare thereby, that all his former reformation
and well-doing, was but in shew only, and
for other ends. And hereby also was Iehues
zeale descried to be vnsound. He made a great
shew a while of zeale for God and his worship:

of: but2 King. 10. 31. he gaue way to the Calues, though no
lesse abominable in Gods sight, and as dishonourable
vnto him, because1 King. 12. 27, 28. that seemed to be
the stay of his estate. And so he shewed thereby
that all his Pietie was no better than meere Policie;
and that he sought but his owne ends in either.
And in like manner when men and women
shall be content to reforme their liues, and conforme
themselues to the will and word of God
in some things, but stand out wilfully in some
other things, refusing to practise the like reformation,
or to shew the like conformitie in them,
albeit they be in heart and conscience conuinced
of their dutie therein, it is an euident Argument
of vnsoundnesse.
            
               
A second Note of Sinceritie is Vniformitie.
               Note 2. Vniformitie. As
an Vniuersalitie, so an vniformitie in well doing:

            But on the other side, when men will
seeme wonderfull earnest and eager for the obseruation
of some of Gods ordinances, maruellous
strict and precise in the keeping of
some precepts, extreme fiery in their opposition
against some enormities, excessiue in
their hatred and detestation of some sinnes,

and feruour in other matters, though of as
great moment, or against other sinnes, though
no lesse hainous than those; albeit they will
not seeme wholly carelesse or altogether regardlesse
either of the one or of the other:
And especially when men will seeme to be so
double diligent in lesse matters, things of ceremonie
and circumstance onely, when they
are but negligent the whiles in far greater; very
strait-laced in the one, but ouer-loose-girt in the
other: It is a shrewd argument that their hearts
are not vpright in either: but that they are carried
away with

like businesses of lesser moment; but in other
matters more weightie they shewed nothing the

like strictnesse, and are by our Sauiour therefore
censured for no better than hollow-hearted hypocrites.

soule no Grace doth so stand at a stay while

a stay, while some one groweth, that any one
should so excessiuely outstrip all the rest,Vt membri unius totus homo quasi lacinia videatur, uti Petron. in Satyr. that

Neither is a Christian man like a new vpstars
Courtier, who because he is not able to furnish
himselfe all ouer compleatly at first, is faine to
weare his apparell vnsutable in the seuerall parts
of it. Yea rather, as it is an argument of affectation
of wealth when men goe well and richly apparelled,
in some one part of their apparell, but
haue not the rest sutable and correspondent
thereunto: so it is an argument rather of affectation
of holinesse, than of true holinesse indeed,
when men are so vnequall and vnsutable in their
courses and dispositions, in some one or two
things demeaning themselues as exceedingly
restrict, but in many others, or the most things
againe as remisse; when their care and conscience
in some things, is not in some sort proportionable
and correspondent to that that they
make shew of in other things: Nor doth the one
proue, much lesse make a man the richer; nay

                  . Plut. de profect. it hindereth rather, and is a meanes to cast him
more behinde hand: nor doth the other proue,
much lesse make a man truly religious; nay it
hindereth rather, while with a generall neglect
of growth in, or regard of other good duties, a
mans studie and care is wholly set and spent vpon
some one particular that hee pleaseth himselfe
in; as where the matter that should nourish
and support the whole bodie, is conueighed all
to some one part, not so much to feed it, as to
feed a wen that groweth vpon it.
            A third Note of Sinceritie,
               Note 3. Vbiquitie. is Vbiquitie: when
a man is in some measure alike in all places, as

wellBonus non fuit, quam malorum pravitas non prohavit. Greg. in Euang. 38. Neque enim perfectè bonus est, nisi qui fuerit &amp; cum malis bonus. Idem in Ezech. l. 1. hō. 9. in bad company as in good, in priuate
as in publike, in Church, out of Church, at home
and abroad. To this purpose it is that Dauid
saith of himselfe;Psal. 16. 8. 
               I haue set the Lord alwaies
before my face. And,Psal. 119. 168. 
               All my waies are in thy
sight. AsPsal. 18. 22. 
               all Gods waies in his sight; so all his
waies in Gods sight: and therefore wheresoeuer
he was, asProv. 15. 3. being euer in Gods eye, he endeuoured
to approue himselfe vnto God. Those things
that are naturall follow a man whithersoeuer he
goeth, and accompany him constantly wheresoeuer
he become.Coelum, non animum mutant, qui trans mare currunt. Horat. l. 1. ep. 11. Hinc Socrates; Quid miraris peregrinationes tibi nō prodesse, cùm te circumser
                     ••
                   Sen. ep. 28. 
               Change of place, saith the
Heathen man, causeth not any change of minde. As
it is with the motion of the heart and the lungs
in the bodie; they are of themselues beating
and stirring wheresoeuer a man is, or whatsoeuer
he is about, and it is painefull to a man
therefore to restraine the worke of them, or to
hold his breath for any time: so it is a good
signe that godlinesse is growne to a kinde of
connaturalnesse with vs, when our religious disposition
continueth with vs in all places, and is
in some sort working in vs, wheresoeuer we are:
so that it is with vs, as with Dauid it was, who
saith of himselfe, thatPsal. 39. 1, 2, 3. howsoeuer he had purposed
to forbeare speaking of ought that was good
while he was in companie with some wicked,
and some prophane ones were in presence, yet
it was no small paine to him, and he was hardly
able to restraine or to containe himselfe. It was
with him as it was sometime with Ieremie, in
somewhat the like case, but of greater necessitie▪
               
when he saw what euill entertainment the word
of God found with the most,Ierem. 20. 9, 10. he had once resolued
he saith, not to mention Gods Name any
more to them; but he could not for his life keepe
long that his vnwarrantable resolution; Gods
word was as a fire in his brest, and as a flame

did, hauing no iust opportunitie for such imployment
at the present; which may be a
meanes to seale vp our sinceritie vnto vs. In
like manner when we shall be religiously affected,
not when we are in the Church onely, or
about some solemne part of Gods seruice, (at
which time the solemnitie of the action, and the
very sight of others enforceth a kinde of conformitie

and outward semblance of holinesse
on those many times that are most prophane,)
but euen out of the Church also, and out of
Gods solemne seruice, euen when we are about
our ordinarie affaires: Nor when we shall be in
the presence only of others, either good or bad,
familiars, or strangers, but when we shall be retired
also and alone by our selues.

               religion (Saint Iames saith it,) is
but vaine and vnsound. Nor is that religion any
better that affecteth view and sight, that loueth
to be seene; (it was the Pharisees deuotionMatth. 6. 1. &amp; 23. 5. that
did all so as men might see what they did:) that
is loud and talkatiue in company, silent in secret,
in presence of others operatiue, idle in priuate.
As the Heathen man saith of one that
Amissum nō flet, cum sola est, Gellia patrem: Si quis adest, jusse prosiliunt lachrymae. Martial. epig. 34. lib. 1. neuer wept or mourned for her mother, but
when there was some bodie by to see her;Non dolet hic, quisquis laudari, Gellia, quaerit: Ille dolet verè, qui sine teste dolet. Ibid. Testes doloris quisquis captat, haud dolet. 
               He
mourneth not heartily that affecteth to bee seene
mourning, and mourneth not therefore but where
some may see it: He mourneth indeed heartily, that
mourneth then when there is none by to take notice
of it, and to beare witnesse that he mourneth. So in
this case, he is not sincerely religious, that affecteth
to haue his religion seene, and that neuer
therefore carieth himselfe religiously, but where
others are by to take notice of it: he is truly religious
that is carefull to cary himselfe religiously,
and is frequent and diligent in holy duties, euen
then when hee is alone by himselfe, as well as
when he is in the presence and company of others;

esteemed, asPsal. 89. 7. Hebr. 4. 12. 1 Cor. 14. 24, 25. hauing a more powerfull, liuely
and effectuall worke of the Spirit in it, andMatth. 18. 20. &amp; 28. 20. a
more speciall blessing of God promised and annexed
vnto it; in regard whereof, Dauid though
a man2 Sam. 23. 2. 
               full of the Spirit of Grace, yet could not
during his exilement content himselfe with his
owne priuate meditations and deuotions, but
Psal. 42. 1, 2, 3, 4. &amp; 43. 4. &amp; 63. 1, 2, &amp; 84. 2. longed exceedingly, and prayed most instantly
to haue free libertie of accesse againe to the
publike assemblies of the Saints: yet when vpon
a mans sicke or death-bed Satan shall be busie about
him, and calling his sinceritie in question, a
man may in such case be more comforted, and
receiue better assurance of his sinceritie, by consideration
of his frequencie and diligence in holy
duties in priuate, because in them there can be
least danger or suspicion of hypocrisie,Matth. 6. 6, 18. which
none but God and his owne soule hath beene

            A fourth Note
               Note 4. Perpetuitie. of Sinceritie is Perpetuitie,
Constancie, permanence, continuance: when we
are not godly and religious by fits and starts only,
vpon some speciall and extraordinary occasions,
butQualitatis verae tenor permanet: falsa non durant. Sen. ep. 120. Perpetua ac solida sunt, quae vera sunt: simulata non perseverant. Ambr. offic. l. 2. c. 22. in a constant and continued course,
at all times, euen when such occasions cease.
Psal. 119. 112. 
               I haue applied my selfe to keepe thy Commandements
continually, saith Dauid: And,Psal. 119. 117. 
               I will delight
my selfe continually in thy Commandements,

which I loue. And,Prov. 28. 14. 
               Blessed is the man, that feareth
continually; saith Salomon. This constant delight
in the word of God, this constant applying
of our selues to the doing of the will of God,
this continual standing in awe of God, is a sound
note of sinceritie. ButMagna rem puta unū homine agere. Preter sapiense nemo unum agit: caeteri multiformes sunt, Modo frugi videntur &amp; graves; modò prodigi &amp; vani. Mutamus subinde persona, &amp; contrariam ei sumimus quam exumus. Sen. epist. 120. when men seeme to be
so affected only vpon some extraordinarie occasions,
and when those are once ouer, all is gone
againe, it is a shrewd signe that nothing was
euer sound or sincere with them. And this well
weighed will easily discouer the vnsoundnesse
of many sorts that yet make a great shew for a
season. Some at the first hearing of the Word
seeme to be wondrously affected and rauished
with it. The noueltie and the strangenesse of the
Doctrine deliuered, (as they say at Athens,
               Act. 17. 18, 19, 32.

new Doctrine, such as we neuer heard of before;)
or the eloquence and powerfull deliuerie of the
Preacher, (someAct. 18. 24.

heard man speake before;) or the consideration
of suchHebr. 6. 5. glorious matters as are in it propounded,
of an heauen and an happinesse, and blessednesse
beyond conceit, and without end; may much
affect euen a naturall man, at the first hearing
especially, and make him to be wondrously delighted
in it: and yet may the Word haue no
sound or sauing worke on him: all may proue
but a flash, and so be by and by gone againe.

               Those that receiue the seed on the stony ground,

want root. This their delight is not permanent,
because the Word had no root in them. Yea thus,

Psal. 78. 34-37. 
               When God slew them, saith the Psalmist, then
they sought him, and returned, and enquired after
God early. But they flattered him only with their
mouth, and lied vnto him with their tongues. For
their heart was neuer vpright with him, neither
were they stedfast in his Couenant. And therefore
well didApud Spinaeum alicubi ni malè memini. the Emperour Sigismunds Confessor
answer him, when being in a sore fit of sicknesse,

and hauing made many goodly faire promises
and protestations of future reformation vpon
recouery, and amendment of life, he desired of
him to be informed, whereby he might discerne
whether such his repentance were sincere; If,

health, what you now promise, as you are forward

swearing and swaggering, blaspheming and tearing

they inuocated, none prophaner than some of

heauie vpon them, &amp; the night of his wrath did
in fearefull manner ouer-spread them, was there
any shew at all of goodnesse or godlinesse to be
seene in them. A particular and pregnant example

               an Image that goeth
with a deuice, that stirreth no longer than
the force lasteth of the screw or the spring that
setteth it a stirring. And that is the difference
between Naturall and Artificiall motions: the
motion of the pulse, and the breath in mans bodie,
and the motion of an Image, or a Mill, and
the like: a free motion and a forced one. The
ground of the motion in the one is from within,
of the other from without: there is some stresse
and straining required to the staying of the one;
and there is some like stresse and straine required
for the stirring of the other: &amp; the one therefore
stirres constantly till it be staid; the other staies
and standeth still till it be stirred: and when that

force and stresse is gone, the one again stirs, when
that force and stresse is gone, the other againe
stayeth. The motion of the godly, in the good
waies of God, is like the pacing of a beast broken
and brought to a true pace, or naturally ambling of
it selfe, hee keepeth to his pace constantly, and
though he may be forced out of it, yet he doth
nothing so well with it,Quomodo Sence. ep. 121. Animalia quaedam tergi durioris inversa tamdiu se torquent, ac pedes exerunt &amp; obliquant, donec ad locum reponantur. Et inquieta est desiderio naturalis status testudo supinata; nec ante desinit niti, quatere se, quàm in pedes constitit. nor is it for his ease,
but hee is euer and anon making offer to come
into it againe, and so doth so soone as he findeth
himselfe free from such enforcement. Whereas
the motion of Hypocrites in Gods waies, is as the
pacing of a beast not truly paced, that being forced
to pace, shuffleth but, and though hee may be
kept a while to it, yet cannot long hold out with
it, is readie, if he be not held hard to it, at euery
step to goe out of it, and is neuer well till hee be
in his trot againe.Exod. 9. 27, 28. &amp; 10. 16, 17. 
               Pharaoh himselfe would relent
somewhat while Gods hand was vpon him,
butExod. 8. 15, 32. &amp; 9. 34, 35. hee hardened his heart againe as soone as
that hand of God was gone: hee was like the
iron, that though it melt while it is in the fire, yet
groweth stiffe againe after it hath beene but a
while out of it: because
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Greg. Naz. in Basil. 
               Iron it was before, and
iron it is still. It is true indeed that a man, especially
one suddenly conuerted, may be much
more feelingly affected presently vpon his conuersion,
than hee shall, it may be, euer after againe:

               a loathing of that Manna, that at
first they seemed so much to like, to loue, to long
after, thatExod. 16. 27. euen on the Sabbath they would

Leeks before it, and a longing after them
againe: where an vtter casting off of all feare of
God and care of good courses, when such occasions,
as put them into it, are once blowne ouer;
it giueth iust ground of suspicion, that the former
forwardnesse in Gods cause was no sincere
loue of God, but a sudden fit of passion only in
the one; the fearefulnesse of Gods wrath no sanctified
feare, but a seruile and slauish disposition
only in the other.
            Yea but will some say peraduenture,Obiections 2. (for my
desire is herein to helpe weake soules and tender
consciences all that I can:Obiection 1.) This is that that
so much troubleth me, that I cannot finde and
feele in my selfe such inward remorse and heartie
sorrow for my sinnes, or such alacritie and viuacitie
of spirit, as sometime I haue done, or as
at my first supposed, but now suspected, conuersion
I did.
            I answer:Answer. Nor is it to be suspected that alwaies
one so should: or is the soundnesse of the
parties conuersion to be either questioned or
suspected in that regard if hee doe not. For it
standeth with reason, that a strange Change, especially
where it is suddenly effected, from one

contrary to another should more affect, and be
more sensible, than the after-continuance of that
estate which by such a change is introduced.
The heat of an hot bath or an hot-house, is more
sensible at our first entrance, especially if on a
sudden we chop into it, than it is when we haue
beene some space of time in it. And

hence it is that the one are oft-times more sensible
of what is wrought vpon them, and done in
them at their first conuersion, than afterward;
the other finde and feele their owne growth and
progresse better than they. Nor are any to be

dismaid or to misdoubt thēselues therfore, those
especially of the former sort, so long as they can
finde in themselues a continued loue of Gods
word, a constant vse of good meanes, and care
of good courses, albeit good things seeme not
so sensible with them, as they did at the first.
            Againe,Obiection 2. will some say, that troubleth me, that
I finde the feare of God indeed so fresh in mee,
when Gods hand is present vpon me, or vpon
some others in my sight; and so little of it againe,
when that is gone. Yea, that I seeme in
such cases to be more affected with the outward
euill it selfe, than with my sinnes that haue procured
it: which maketh me to feare, that this my
feare is at the most but a seruile feare, and such
as Hypocrites are wont in the like cases to haue.
            I answer:Answer 1. 1. It is agreeable both to reason
and to religion, that the Feare of God should be
more fresh with vs, and more than ordinary at
other times, when speciall occasions thereof occurre.
1 Chron. 13. 12. 
               Dauid feared God that day, saith the
Story; what time Vzza was so suddenly smitten
and slaine. He feared him before, but his feare
was then much more than ordinary, by occasion
of that extraordinary iudgement. Yea, for a
man not to haue his feare of God in some sort
proportioned to the various and diuers occasions
of expressing and exercising it; as for a man
to feare no more, or no otherwise, when some
eminent iudgements of God discouer themselues
either incumbent or imminent, on himselfe
or on others, than hee doth ordinarily at

other times; were a strange kinde of stupiditie,
and a shrewd argument of vnsoundnesse. It is
one thing to cast off all feare and regard of God
at other times; and another thing not to haue
his feare so fresh in vs at other times, as on such
occasions we finde and feele it to be.
            2.Answer 2. It is to be considered, that the feare euen
of Gods wrath, or the seruile feare, as it is vsually
termed, isTimor servili

               an hatred of
him whom it feareth, it is euill, and produceth
many euill and sinfull effects. For it is a thing in
nature, (and I speake now not of nature corrupted,
but of nature created) forAb interitu natura abhorret: hinc ingenita cui

of his fathers wrath, or not to feare his fathers

            3.Answer 3. It is not to be wondred, considering that
there is ordinarily a far lesse measure of grace
than of corruption in the most, and that grace
also strippeth vs not wholly of this feare, but
doth onely qualifie and correct it, if euen in
Gods childrenPsal. 32. 3, 4. the apprehension of Gods
heauy indignation doe so drowne the consideration
of their owne transgressions, that they can
hardly amids those terrors andPsal. 55. 4, 5. horrors that
their hearts and minds are possessed with, descry
and discerne their griefe and sorrow for their
sinnes.Psal. 119. 119, 120.

               When I heard of it,
saith Habbakuk, my belly quaked, and my lips quiuered,
and I trembled and shooke, so that my bones
seemed to be not out of ioint, but euen rotten
againe. And

                  ; Greg. Naz. ad cives periclitant. if it were so with such Worthies,
no maruell if the like sometime befall weake
ones.
            4.Answer 4. Let it be remembred, that as Grace doth
not wholly strip vs of this Feare, so it doth not
crosse vs, but concurre rather with vs in the vse
and exercise of it. And it followeth not therefore
that a mans sorrow for his sinne is not sincere,
because his feare of Gods wrath is greater
or rifer in him than it. It is a Question propounded
by
                  Perkins Cases of Conscience, lib. 1. cap. 5. quaest. 1. sect. 2. case 3. a worthy Diuine, whether a mans
griefe for his sinne may be deemed sincere or
no, when he can weepe more for the losse of
some deare friend than for it. And his Answer
is, which may well also serue, because the reason
will hold, here; that it may, because nature
and grace concurre in the one, whereas nature and
grace crosse in the other. Since that Grace therefore
doth not wholly either inhibite or restraine
a man either from fearing of outward iudgements,
or being sensible of outward euils, so
that Grace and Nature crosse not but concurre
rather therein; whereas in godly sorrow for sin,
corrupt Nature concurreth not with Grace, but is
crosse rather and auerse thereunto: it is not to
be maruelled, (especially where Grace yet is but

               weake) if that feare and griefe be greater, or more
sensible at least, (forCasus leves loquuntur, ingentes stupent. Sen. tragoed. the greatest griefe is not
alwaies the most sensible, nor maketh alwaies
the most shew;Plu

more heartily sorry for a consumption that hee

the very heart with him, for the present,)

one is alone, and the other hindereth more than

            A fift Note
               Note 5. of Sinceritie, may be a Iealousie of
ones owne Hypocrisie:
               Iealousie of Hypocrisie. when a man is suspicious
of himselfe, and timorous lest he should be vnsincere.
As the Disciples of our Sauiour, when
he told them,Matth. 26. 21. 
               One of you will betray me▪
                though
they knew themselues farre from any such
thought or purpose at the present, yet euery one
of them began to suspect himself, that he might
be the man that our Sauiour Christ meant,
andMatth. 26. 22. to aske thereupon, Is it I, Lord? or Is it
I? Iudas that was the man indeed, was most silent
of any; though at lengthMatth. 26. 25. he aske also for
company, lest by not asking when each other
did, hee might moue suspition, and so bewray
himselfe by his silence. And in like manner is
it here. Hypocrites doe least question their owne
sinceritie of all others. They most misdoubt
it vsually that are furthest of all from it.Psal. 119. 60. 
               Oh,
let mine heart be vpright in thy Statutes, saith sincere
Dauid; (as suspecting or misdoubting himselfe,

lest it might proue otherwise;) that I may
not be shamed. Mad-men are not wont to question
whether they be in their right wits or no. Yea
               Non est insanus, insanum qui se dicit. Apu

               they are not mad, saith one, that thinke or suspect
that they are. And certainly this godly iealousie,
this shienesse of vnsoundnesse is so good and so
sure an argument of sinceritie, that I know none
better, none surer than it. For such carefull and
anxious inquiry, such fearfulnesse of hypocrisie,
argueth a strong desire of sinceritie: and the desire
of Grace, as we shall see afterward, is generally
agreed on to be Grace. Yea euen ouer-much
timorousnesse and superfluous curiositie in this
kinde, when men cannot satisfie themselues with
anything, no not with the pregnantest proofes
of it, and are therefore thereby much disturbed,
perplexed, and distracted, though it be an infirmitie,
and ought therefore with all good endeuour
to be remedied, because it dismayeth, disheartneth,
disturbeth the peace of the minde, depriueth
the soule of alacritie, dulleth and dampeth
the spirits, and hindereth much in the performance
of many necessarie good duties; yet

                   Chrysost. in Matth. hom. 25. the more men beleeue, the more they come
to see and feele their owne vnbeleefe; the further
they wade on in the studie and practise of repentance,
the more they finde out and discouer their
owne impenitence, and complaine of the hardnesse
and vnto wardnesse of their hearts: the
more they labour and make progresse in sound
sanctification, the more come they to apprehend
and to see into the depth of their corruption. And
this very sense of the want of grace, is a good argument
of grace. It is a sure signe of Grace, to see no
Grace, and to see it with griefe. For,Matth. 5. 3. 
               Blessed,
saith our Sauiour, are those that are poore in spirit;
euen as well as thoseMatth. 5. 8. 
               that are pure in Spirit.
The one, he saith,Matth. 5. 8. 
               shall see God, and the other
hath a present right to the Kingdome of God, which
is the same in effect:Matth. 5. 3. 
               For the Kingdome of God
is theirs. He saith not, Blessed are the rich in
Grace; though that also be most true: but, Blessed
are the poore in spirit: that is, such as are spiritually
poore, humbled, deiected, cast downe in the
sight and sense of their owne wants, apprehending
nothing so much as the want of grace in
themselues. Such are blessed, because such are
Vt verum sit hîc quod Prov. 13. 7. 
               rich, though they cannot yet come to see and
apprehend their owne wealth. And this hee
saith no doubt, that if any weake one be not able

yet to discerne the puritie of his owne heart, hee
may yet be comforted in the very pouertie of his
Spirit: the serious sense whereof may assure him
that he is in part come out of his sinne, and is entred
into the state of grace. ForQu

signe that a man is awaked out of his sleepe,
when he discouereth and seeth the errours of his
Dreame. And it is in these cases with men commonly,
as it is in drawing vp of water; as long
as the bucket is vnder water wee feele not the
weight of it, but so soone as it commeth aboue
water, it beginneth to hang heauie on the hand:
when a man diueth vnder water hee feeleth no
weight of the water, though there be many tun
of it ouer his head;Elementa in loco suo gravia nō sunt. Vide Syrianum &amp; Ptolomaeum apud Simplic. ad Aristot. de Coelo l. 4. c. 16. &amp; Scortiam. de Nilo l. 2. c. 11. 
               The element, they say,
weigheth not in his owne proper place; whereas
halfe a tub full of the same water taken out of
the riuer and set vpon the same mans head,
would be very burdensome vnto him, and make
him soone grow wearie of it. In like manner,
so long as a man is ouer head and earesAct. 8. 23. 
               in sin,
he is not sensible of the weight of sinne, it is not
troublesome at all to him; but when hee beginneth
once to come out of that state of sin, wherein
he lay and liued before, then beginneth sinne
to hang heauie on him, and hee to feele the heauie
weight of it. So long as sinne is inPeccatum intantū volumarium est malum, ut nisi fuerit voluntarium, nō sit peccatum. Aug. de verarelig. c. 14. Hinc Bern. de temp. 58. Tolle malam voluntatem, &amp; non erit infernus. Mala enim voluntas malorum omnium &amp; vitiorum origo. Ide de vita s

to grow burdensome vnto him, and to

and then beginneth he poore soule pestred and

that hangeth so heauy vpon my soule? It is
with him as with one that hath had a fit of the
falling sicknesse, or that beginneth to recouer
againe after a dead palsie. So long as a man is in
a fit of the falling sicknesse, though he be for the
time in such lamentable plight, that he lieth along
like a beast, vnable to stand on his legs, or
to lift vp himselfe, or doe ought to helpe himselfe,
foaming and sprawling, and beating his
own bodie, a ruefull sight to all that see him; yet
is he all the while himselfe insensible of ought:
but when the fit is once ouer, and the man is
come to himselfe againe, then he beginneth to

finde and feele himselfe all out of frame, his head
heauie and giddie, his eyes staring and distorted,
his brain and whole body disturbed and strangely
disposed, all which before he was not sensible
of: As also while a man lieth, rather than liueth,
held with a dead palsie, though he be not able to
stirre hand or foot, yet

                  . Plut. de profect. hath hee himselfe no
sense of it; but when those dead parts of him
are in some measure reuiued againe, the passages
being opened for the vitall Spirits to repaire to
them, and so sense and motion restored to them
in part, then making offer to goe or to stirre, hee
beginneth to feele and complaine of the stiffenesse
and starknesse of his limbes and ioynts,
and a generall vnwealdinesse throughout his
whole bodie. And in like manner is it here. So
long as a man is whollyEphes. 2. 1. Coloss. 2. 13. 
               dead in sinne, albeit he
be as much disabled vnto the doing of any holy
dutie, as a dead man is vnto the actions of this
life, yet he findeth it not,Mortuū est membrum, quod dolorem non sentit. Bern. medit. c. 12. he feeleth it not, hee
apprehendeth no such either disabilitie in himselfe,
or difficultie in the duties that hee should
doe; but when any measure of spirituall life is
once infused into the soule, wherebyRom. 6. 11. hee liueth
now to God, that lay before spiritually dead,
now striuing to apply himselfe vnto Gods
worke, and to walke in the good waies of God,
he beginneth to finde and feele, with much paine
and griefe of minde, his owne infirmitie and
weaknesse, the strange blindnesse of his minde, the
dulnes and drowsines of his spirits, the vntowardnesse
of his heart, the rebelliousnesse of his will;
               
the sense whereof is a sure argument of spirituall
life begun in him. For as Augustine saith well,
though in another case and vpon another occasion;
Potest esse vita sine dolore; dolor sine vita esse non potest. Aug. de Civit. l. 19. c. 13. 
               There may be some life without griefe; but
there can be nogriefe without life. So there may
be some spiritual life without any sense of paine
or griefe at all, as with the glorified ones in heauen
it is: but there can be no2 Cor. 7. 10. Argumentū salutis est via doloris. Greg. mor. l. 6. c. 17. 
               godly sorrow or
sense of spirituall paine and griefe, where no beginning
at all of spirituall life is. And therefore
it is that our Sauiour also pronounceth them
Matth. 5. 4. 
               Blessed, that thus mourne: nor doth he say that
they shall be, but that they are alreadie in a blessed
estate, and that in due timeIbid. 
               they shall haue comfort.
Yea, vndoubtedly these very heauie and
vncomfortable signes are of all other the surest
signes of true grace and sinceritie, because least
subiect to deceit and delusion of any.
            A seuenth Note of sinceritie,
               Note 7. Desire of Grace. is an earnest Desire
of Grace. Though a man cannot discerne yet
any Grace in himselfe, yet if hee doe seriously and
earnestly desire grace, it is a good signe of some beginning
of Grace. For it is Grace, euen to desire
Grace. It is the first step vnto Grace, for a man to
see no Grace; and it is the first degree of Grace, for
a man to desire Grace: when a mans heart doth
with an holy Eccho answer Gods voice as Dauids
did:Psal. 27. 8.

will I seeke. And,Psal. 119. 4, 5.

to keepe thy Law. Oh that my waies were

on those words of the Prophet;Lam. 3. 25. 
               The
Lord is good to those that wait on him, and to the
Soule that seeketh him: For as it is elsewhere,
Prov. 8. 17. 1 Chron. 28. 9. 
               those that so seeke him, shall finde him

               If God,
saith he, be so good to those that seeke him; What

will he be to them, when they finde him? But this is
a strange thing, that no man can so seeke him before
he hath found him. And surely, as no man can
sincerely seeke God in vaine; so no man can sincerely
desire grace in vaine.Quid tibi jubet Deus? dilige me. Aurū diligis. Quaesiturus es forte, nec inventurus. Qui

               A man may loue
Gold, and yet not haue it: but no man loueth God,
but he is sure to haue God, saith Augustine.
               Prov. 13. 4. 
               Wealth
a man may desire, and yet be neuer the nearer it:
but Grace no man euer sincerely desired and missed
of it. It is true here that the Psalmist in another
case saith;Psal. 10. 17. 
               Lord, thou hearest the desire of the
poore; thou hast prepared their heart, and thine eare
hearkeneth to their prayers. It is God that hath
prepared the heart, and wrought this desire in it;
(forPhilip. 2. 13. 
               it is God that worketh such willingnesse in
vs:) and he will neuer frustrate the desire that
himselfe hath there wrought. Yea, as no man,
saith he, can seeke God but he that hath found him;
and it is a signe therefore that a man hath alreadie
found God in part, when seriously and sincerely
he seeketh him: SoHuc usque te faciente profeci, ut desiderē desiderare te. Quid est autem desiderare desiderium? Si enim desidero esse desiderans, jam invenio me desiderantē. Sed nunquid desiderium tui desiderantem, quasi non habeam, aut desiderium majus quam habeam? Gulielm. de S. Theodor. de amor. Dei c. 2. 
               no man can desire
grace, but he that alreadie hath grace: (for he that
desireth grace, hath grace to desire it:) and it is an
infallible signe therefore, that a man hath alreadie
some measure of grace, that doth seriously
desire to haue it. He would neuer desire to feare
God, that stood not in some awe of him alreadie:
nor desire to feele in himselfe a loue of God,
that did not in some measure already loue God:
Nor could a man euer truly desire sanctifying
grace, were not his heart alreadie sanctified by
the Spirit of Grace, which hath wrought also in

him that desire of it. Not to adde that the

well-being.Num. 23. 10.

true feare of God, serious repentance, is more
than any naturall man euer did or can doe. And
therefore Blessed are they, saith our Sauiour, as,

               that are poore in spirit, andMatth. 5. 4. 
               that mourne for

supply of them. Now what is

               hunger but a
want of food with a sense thereof, and an earnest desire

of it? or what is thirst but a drought, a want
of drinke, and a vehement desire of it? For in
hunger and thirst there are these three things:
first, an emptinesse in the one, and a want of moisture
in the other: forHinc

simply, but want of wetting that causeth this: secondly,
a sense of this emptinesse and want of moisture,
with a speciall kinde of paine and griefe in the
bodie proceeding from it: For a man may be
emptie bodied, and yet not affected thus with it,

emptinesse may be filled, or this drought slaked:

haue no appetite to his meat neither, butQuanto inanior, tanto fas

of that rather, whereby hee might be refreshed
and releeued: he may be emptie of food,
and yet feele it not; he may feele it in some sort,
and yet not desire food. But in hunger and thirst
ordinarily doe these all three concurre. Yea, so
vehement and violent is this desire of such supply
oft in hunger and thirst, that2 King. 6. 25, 28, 29. Lament. 1. 11. Hinc Lysimachꝰ siti laborans cum post se suosque hosti deditos bibisset,

bread, or a cup of drinke, men haue many times
been content to part with the dearest and pretiousest
things that they haue beene possest of. In
like manner is it in this spiritual hunger and thirst.
There is first spirituall pouertie, a vacuitte, an emptinesse
of grace, to sight and sense it may be, vtterly
of all, in deed and truth of some degree of
it: there is secondly a

the heart and soule arising from the apprehension
of it, a mourning and bemoaning of ones selfe
for the want of it: and thirdly,Est sitis interior, uti &amp; venter interior; quia est homo interior. Aug. in Ioan. 32. Ipsum desiderium sitis est animae. Idem in Psal. 62. 
               an earnest desire
of it aboue all things in the world, so that
as a man throughly an hungred counteth all nothing
in regard of meat, a man heartily a-thirst
all nothing in comparison of drinke, he would
giue any thing for it: so the soule thus affected,
with the blessed Apostle countethPhilip. 3. 8, 9, 10.

knowledge of him, faith in him, and conformity vnto

though it be neuer so richly arrayed, and haue
neuer so many costly iewels hanging about it,
yet all is as nothing to it, nothing but the nurses

of quiet. So nothing but spirituall grace can here
satisfie the soule, &amp; all other things are esteemed
as nothing to it. Or as with some women that
goe with childe, and are subiect to longing; they
will part with any thing for that that they long
for, and are readie euen to sinke downe, to faint,
to goe away, yeaQuomodo Rachel de prole. Gen. 30. 1. to die, if they haue it not: So

of it, is the thing longed for, &amp; that they would

had it, and they are readie euen to faint and sinke
vnder that heauie weight of griefe that surchargeth
their distressed soules, because they cannot
yet finde and feele that in themselues, which yet
vndoubtedly they haue. For certainly whosoeuer

to be in a blessed estate, and consequently in the
state of grace, (for what true happinesse out of
it?) or else they must contradict our Sauiour,
and chargeIohn 14. 6. 
               Truth it selfe with vntruth, who
hath pronounced them blessed that are so affected.
And this I desire to haue well weighed
and seriously considered for the staying of many
troubled soules. What is it that doth so much
trouble thee, and in this lamentable wise distresse
and distract thee? Oh, saith he presently,
I haue no faith, no repentance, no loue, no feare of
God, no sanctifying, no sauing grace in me. Why?
doest thou see a want of these things in thy selfe?
Yes, that is it that so grieueth me: that I cannot loue
God, stand in awe of him, trust in his mercie, repent
of my sinnes as I should. Yea but, doest thou not
seriously and vnfainedly desire to doe thus?
Oh yes, I desire it aboue all things in the world, and
I would be willing to buy, and it were with a whole
world, the least measure, a dramme or a drop onely,
of such grace. AndQuaerit anima verbum, sed quae à verbo prius quaesita sit. Audi profugam &amp; deviam, quid doleat, &amp; quid petat. Psal. 119. 176. Nec expositam omninò nec relictam dixerim qu

            An eighth Note of Sinceritie may be a desire
and endeuour of growth in grace:

also will be: there cannot but be a serious
endeuour, where the desire of the heart is sincere.

poore men, so long as they come short of such
and such. And so is it with these; they are oft
eying those, whose either examples they reade
of, or whose courses and graces they are in some
sort eye-witnesses of, and thinke that they haue
nothing, they make no progresse, at least worth
speaking of, so long as they come behinde, and
keepe short of such: And this is it oft that maketh
them complaine so much of their wants &amp;
their slow progresse, and that they cannot perceiue

yet complaint of theirs, and feruent desire of
growth in grace, is a sure argument of sincere and
vndoubted grace in them. Yea it is an argument
that they loue not life onely but grace, that they
loue Grace for it selfe, that they loue Grace as it
is Grace, when they desire so much to increase

to be in the estate of it alreadie.

gotten some small measure of speculatiue

that he had not seene before, how much corruption
remained yet in him vnseene. In like manner
had hee beene sifting of himselfe, when hee

thanke him heartily, when he shall by his Law

            And that the Loue of Gods Children for God,
               Loue of Gods Children for God.
is a good Signe of the loue of God, it is no lesse apparent.
1 Iohn 5. 1. 
               Hee that loueth him that begat, saith
Saint Iohn, loueth him also that is begotten. And
he that loueth him that is begotten, say I, loueth
him also that begat. It was2 Sam. 9. 3, 7. for Ionathans
sake principally, that Dauid loued and fauoured
Mephibosheth. Nor could a man for God loue the
Children of God, if he did not first loue God himselfe.
In regard whereof also Saint Iohn maketh
this Loue of Gods Children a Signe that a man1 Iohn 2. 10. 
               is
in the light, to 
                  〈◊〉

that he1 Iohn 4. 7.

               sincerely loue God, and is beloued
consequently of God. And as Dauid testifieth the
sinceritie of his Loue vnto God, by his louing,

that which I here in this last Note principally
aime at,Constant vse of Gods Ordinances. and will therefore most insist on, is this,
that then the sinceritie of a mans heart herein
doth most euidently appeare, when he persisteth
thus constantly in louing God, and Gods children,
cleauing to God, following him, frequenting his Ordinances,
and depending vpon him,
               And Obseruance of Gods wayes. though God
seeme not to regard him, nor doe reueale himselfe
yet vnto him in that comfortable manner,Psal. 119. 132. as
he doth frequently and vsually vnto those that
be his.Esai. 8. 17. 
               Yet will I wait vpon the Lord, saith the

               though he hide his face from
me, and carry himselfe towards me as an enemie.
Hereby doe the people of God in the Psalme approue
their sinceritie vnto 
                  〈◊〉
               , and the vprightnesse
of their hearts with him, in thatPsal. 44. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24. Nec iratum colere destiter. ant numen: uti Sen. ad Marc. c. 13.

seeke to any other helpes. And it is certainly an argument
of a great measure of grace, when a

Christian Soule, though finding in it selfe so
weake encouragement, in regard of comfort or
assurance, to depend vpon God, yet can firmely
resolue constantlyEsai. 50. 10.

shall see it fit and seasonable in mercie, further
to reueale himselfe, and to minister vnto it the
inward comforts of his Spirit. As on the other
side it is a shrewd Signe of insinceritie and vnsoundnesse,
when men are readie to cast off all
religious regard, if they cannot in good exercises
finde present comfort; or shall be readie, if God
do not instantly answer them according to their
desires, to say with Iorams profane Pursueuant,

            Neither are we to thinke that the prayers and
other holy exercises of such so affected, as before
was said, in regard of the want of that alacritie
and cheerefulnesse of spirit in them, are therefore
either altogether vnprofitable to themselues,
or vnacceptable in Gods sight. For to
omit, that there is oft more true spirituall viuacitie
               
in the prayers and other exercises of persons
euen so affected, than in the prayers and exercises
of many others;Videatur similitudo de Aqua tubis &amp; cana

both to preserue life, to keepe from fainting and
further weaknesse, and to strengthen also in
some measure: so holy actions though performed
with much infirmitie and weaknesse, yet
with an holy and religious diligence, may much
benefit the soule so performing the same, albeit
it finde little spirituall relish in them, or feele no
comfort from them for the present. Yea, howsoeuer
it be true, as I saidMotiue 2. before, that the

he cannot follow him but with much paine and

such a poore soule therefore be the lesse acceptable

such alacritie and delight asQuomodò de aegroto Aug. in Psal. 118. conc. 8. Aegrotus qui fastidio laborat, &amp; vult evadere hoc malum, concupiscit desiderare cibum, dum concupiscit non habere fastidium. Et appetit animus, ut appeta

in like manner for Faith and dependance vpon

God. It is not an argument of no Faith, when a
man cannot yet attaine to a full perswasion and
assurance of Gods speciall fauour towards him, and
of the free remission of his sinnes in Christ, that
many other faithfullGalat. 2. 20. 1 Iohn 3. 14. &amp; 5. 19, 20. haue had, and many

rather of Faith, that asNon praecedunt justificandum, sed sequuntio justificafum. Aug. de fid. &amp; oper. c. 14.

               to cleaue vnto
God with full purpose of heart, to sticke close vnto

Psal. 13. 1, 5. &amp; 43. 2, 5. like a Courtier, who though the King shew
him no Countenance, but seeme wholly to neglect
him, and not at all to regard him, yet will
still follow the Court, and tender his seruice, and
resolue to giue attendance, hoping yet to finde
acceptance at length, yea to doe it constantly,
whether he shall finde acceptance or no; or like

off with much disgrace: it is a sound argument of
a true and a liuely Faith, and of no small measure
of the same.
            Where if it be demanded how this trusting to,
               Question.
               and dependance vpon God, may stand with the
want of such assurance. I shall not need to say
much, because the Argument hath byMr

Brother beene of late handled at large.
            Only I make it plaine by this familiar Comparison.
               Answer.
Put case a poore man hath occasion to
make vse of some great Courtier for the effecting
of some businesse of great consequence for him,
euen as much as his life lieth on, or all that euer
he is worth, as suppose the procuring him his
pardon for some capitall crime from the Prince.
And this great Courtier telleth him, that though
he be but a stranger, one that can claime no such
thing from him, yea one that hath deserued many
waies euill of him, yet if he trust only to him,
and rely wholly vpon him, hee will do that for
him, which the poore wretch requireth of him.
This poore man now in this case may trust only
to him, &amp; neglecting all other means that either
others may aduise him to, or himselfe sometime
thinke on, rely wholly vpon him; and yet hee
may not be fully perswaded that he will effect it
for him neither. The consideration of his owne

feare arising from the apprehension of the
great danger that hee is in, and the subtill perswasion

of others that would beare him in hand
that he will but delude him, and not doe for him
as he saith, may either seuerally or ioyntly be a
meanes to hold his minde in suspence, and to
keepe him from such assurance. Yea his very
mistaking and misconstruction of the great mans
meaning, when he saith, If you will trust to, or rely
vpon me alone for it, being possest with a conceit
that his want of a full perswasion that hee
will doe it, which hee cannot yet for his heart-bloud
bring his minde to any setled assurance
of, doth euidently shew that he doth nor trust to
him, may be a meanes to make him beleeue, that
he will neuer do it for him, because he doth not,
what he supposeth is therein absolutely required
of him, which to that great man also, if hee
should be demanded of it, not daring to tell an
vntruth, would appeare. And yet for all this he
may resolue to sticke to his mediation only, and
to rely wholly vpon him, and not to seeke or trie
any other way, whatsoeuer any man shall perswade
him to the contrary, or whatsoeuer the
issue and euent of it shall be. And euen so may it
well be, and is questionlesse with a Christian
soule many times.Iohn 3. 16, 36. &amp; 5. 24. God hath proclaimed and
published a Patent of pardon and saluation by
Christ, to all that trust to him for the same. A
man may so doe, encouraged thereunto by
this gratious offer and the condition to it annexed,
yea many an one so doth, and yet partly
out of the sight and consideration of his owne
vnworthinesse, partly out of a kind of timorousnesse

and pusillanimity of spirit, partly by reason
of some strong melancholike imagination, and
partly also through some powerfull delusion of
Satan, not be able possibly to perswade himselfe
that Christ is yet his, or that hee hath interest in
him, hath his sinnes pardoned for him, and shall
liue eternally by him. Yea the very mistaking
of the true Nature of sauing Faith, and supposing
the very essence of it to consist in this particular
perswasion, (which yet is onely an effect
and a fruit, yea such a fruit of it, as doth not
necessarily alwaies spring from it,Psal. 31. 22. &amp; 77. 7, 8, 9. &amp; 88. 14. &amp; 116. 11. nor is at all
times of the yeere euer constantly found on it,)
and that therefore he doth not trust in Christ so
long as he wanteth it, is a maine meanes to keep
many from it, and from the comfort of it, which
yet haue true Faith, and doe vnfainedly trust in
Christ for all that: As by many other sound
and vndoubted Arguments, which if they be
questioned with and vrged to it, not daring to
denie them, lest they should lie against their
owne conscience, may be drawne from their
owne confessions &amp; answers concerning themselues,
(when there is no feare of hypocrisie,
lest they should therein dissemble, being more
prone to charge than to cleare, and to alledge
matter against themselues, than to produce any
thing for themselues;) will euidently appeare.
Among which Arguments also euen this, though
it come last, yet is none of the least, if their conscience
vnfainedly can testifie for them, that
though they haue not yet such a perswasion and

assurance of Gods mercy toward them in Christ for
the remission of their sinnes and the saluation of
their soules, yet theyPsal. 51. 11, 12. vnfainedly desire, and

               Who so trusteth in the Lord, saith Salomon, ô
blessed is he. And what a great measure of grace
is it for a man to trust thus in God, while he lieth
yet vnder the sense and apprehension of his
wrath?
            Those therefore,Conclusion. whatsoeuer they are, that
hauing by these or the like Notes and Signes examined

beginning of grace be mixt with much weaknesse,
they may know thereby and assure themselues
that they haue right to, and interest in the
Light and Ioy of the Iust here spoken of: and
they may therefore safely lay hold on it, admit
it, giue way to it, receiue it and harbour it in
their hearts; yea that they wrong themselues,
Gods grace in them, and his goodnesse towards
them, whenPsal. 77. 2. they refuse and repell it, hauing
