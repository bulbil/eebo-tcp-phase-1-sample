            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               ¶Of the body exercyſe and of his profyte.
               WE owen vnto know by actours of lechecrafte that tho that ſhall lyue fayre and well in holſom gouernaunce / ought to haue euyn and tē
                  pered exercyſe to fore mete / for that gyueth to all the body tempered hete euyn and not paſſynge / whiche ſholde a mannes exercyſe be / a phecyſyen dyſcryueth

thus. Exercyſe is a wylfull meuynge by whiche a mannes wynde is made grete &amp; oft it nedeth yt this trauayl be wylfull / &amp; not ſtreſſed by nede but that he be all fre and werke after his owne wyll. And therfore laboure of carpenters &amp; plowmen maſones maryners &amp; ſuche other is none exercyſe of lechecrafte / for it hath not properly wylfull meuynge / marchauntes truely burgeys cloyſterers &amp; ſuche other walkynge well &amp; longe / but it is not properly exercyſe of lechecrafte. But whanne a man walketh frely of his owne wyll / &amp; ſoo ſwyftly tyll he begynne to faynt &amp; his wynde chaūge / then anone he ſholde reſte / for yf he meuyd ony ferther / it ſholde be payne &amp; fayntneſſe / &amp; ſuche exercyſe is cleped tempred for therby growe many godes to mānes body fyrſt for therby is ye kyndly hete ſtrēgthed &amp; eche &amp; ſo ben other four vertues yt is to ſay / vertu drawynge / vertu defyenge / vertu witholdynge / and vertu out puttynge and ſo ben there .v. bodely wyttes / yt is to ſay / herynge / ſeynge / ſmellynge / taſtynge / &amp; felynge / &amp; ſo bē ther thre myndly vertues / yt is to ſay / maginityf dyſcretyf &amp; memoratyf. And though erroure happed in all theſe werkynges of lechecrafte ſo it were not to notable &amp; exercyſe were as ſholde be ſholde neuer mannes body nede other medecyne / for exercyſe fulfylleth ye defautes of al other / for they be not mery ye drede blodelettȳge &amp; ſuch other / but by exercyſe may be heled netheles .ij. thȳges ben nedefull to euery well exercyſed yt is to ſay yt he be not to full ne to empy to full then wolde the humours louſe and ſo were grete drede of the lyuer or ſom feuer or ſodeyne dethe for thy in ſuche a caſe loke that there be longe dyſcrete abſtynence ſo that he be not to empty for than ſholde his body he feble out of meſure and at

why eche day exercyſe is fulled full to kepe a mannes helth for who yt eteth or drynketh moche / maye not be hole but yf he wyll ſōwhat ſlepe &amp; ſwynke. Then theſe thynges yt be ſayd it ſheweth yt meſured exercyſe hath many profytes for it / ſtyreth ye kyndly hete &amp; openeth the poores / &amp; louſeth colde and thycke tough humours And whan they ben louſed bereth them out at the poores &amp; maketh a mānes ioyntes ſlypper &amp; lyght &amp; it cō

Wherfore noyous humours ben more holſomly pourged &amp; meſured by exercyſe than by laxatyues or vomytees / for nother of them may be without empeyrement of kynde / and ryght as due kepynge of kyndly exercyſe is nedefull / ſo other whyle is reſte. For why reſte in aſmoch as it is contrary to exercyſe / ſome is bodyly / ſome is ghoſtlye / of whiche eche eyther yf it be meſured after that kynde wolde it is heleful both to the body and ſoule / and yf it be not ſo it is contrarye. ¶For why yf reſte be to moche it engēdreth nouryſſheth and multypleth euyll humours and encreaſeth moche corrupcyon. For why whan water reſtethe to moche it ſtȳketh / ſo Iron and eche metall ruſteth whan it reſteth.

Another ſpyce is to

ryde &amp; that is for ryche men / but grete prelates muſte haue other maner of exercyſe for why in chambre ſhal be a grete corde knytted in the ende &amp; hanged vp / and take that corde with both hondes and ſtonde vpryght ſoo that thou touche not the erthe and ſtonde a good whyle then rynne as moche as thou mayſte heder and theder with that corde and other whyle ſkyppe / and yf this pleaſe the not / haue a ſtone of .xxx.li. weyght or there aboute and yf thou wylte haue helth therin ofte bere that ſtone fro that one ſyde of the houſe to that other ſyde / or a longe whyle holde vp that ſtone or thou let it downe or bere it aboute thy necke / or bythene thyn hōdes / and ſo of other maners tyll thou faynt or thus holde a ſtaffe in thy honde &amp; lette another take it from the yf he may with euen draught / or thus cloſe a peny in thyne honde and lete an other take it yf he maye or thus holde thy breth as longe as thou mayſt and then puffe it out as herde as thou mayſt doo. ¶And this maner of exercyſe is full prouffytable to put out noyous ſuperfluytees / for why many ſuperfluytees in ſlepe ben witholdē therfore yf thou haue none other maner of exercyſe holdynge of brethe helpeth it moche. ¶Yet there ben other maners of exercyſe for yonge men that ben luſty as to renne / to wraſtle / to lepe / too caſte the ſtone / and ſo of other playes / alſo tempred freſſhely companynge with a yonge broune woman is good in wynter / and with a yonge whyte womā is gode in ſomer &amp; is alſo good and helpynge in gouernyng of helth to boby but not to ſoule / excepte to them than that mowen haue it by goddes lawes ſo netheles that there be ſo moche tyme bytwene yt he fele hȳſelf eaſed &amp; lyghtned in his body and that he ete the better and

And for why whan a man caſteth out that noble humours to moche he is hugely dyoſclored and his body moche febled more then he lete four ſythes ſoo moche blode oute of his body / alſo who that moche deleth or companyeth fleſſhly with a woman lyghtly catcheth the palſey with more euyll.
            
            
               ¶How a man ſholde behaue hym in etynge.
               WHan a man hathe welle exercyſed hym as it is ſayd tofore / reſt a whyle after and whan a lytell freſſhe whete brede well baked and ſomdele ſoured then drynke a draught of good clere wyne or other good ſauery drynke then reſt a whyle after &amp; ſtudy in ſome wyſe meanes thē haue ſom ſolace &amp; myrth wt thy frendes &amp; with other honeſt cōpany. Then ayēſt euyn take thy mete and ſupper mooſt ſauourly but yf thy cuſtome be there agaynſt. But generall rule of all fyſyke and leches / is that thyn houre of etynge be whā yu arte kȳdly hūgry / &amp; tofore ye hūgre ete not / but yf it be a lytel meſſe of good werme mete to prouoke thȳ appetyte with &amp; whan thou haſt appetyte let not / for as a fecyſyon ſayth the ſtomak out of vſe to ſuffer hunger fulfylleth ye body of roten humours. And then wyl a mānes body wex noughty humours / bycauſe yt the colere is drawē to ye mouh of ſtomak / ſo yt 
                  aftward whā he wolde ete he may not. Ferthermore it is to wytte yt
                  
no man ſholde ete but he knewe certaynly his ſtomacke voyde of that thynge that he ete to fore / &amp; that ſhall a man knowe by deſyre that he hath to ete / &amp; by plente of ſpyttynge comynge vp to his mouthe. For who yt eteth without deſyre of his mete ſhall fynde the kyndely hete of his ſtomacke colde / &amp; he that eteth with deſyre he ſhall fynde kyndely his ſtomacke gyue vp a ſmel and ſauoure lyke enſence / by theſe &amp; ſuche other ſholde be vnderſtonde of theym that haue mete ordeyned at theyr owne wyll / and who that wyll not ete whan ſom euer that he myghte haue mete for they ben not bounden to the lawes of this crafte dyatory as to the qualytees of the metes / vnderſtonde that thylke mete whiche that mooſt gouerneth thyn helthe ſholde not be paſſynge in ony qualyte / for why / metes that ben to hote brenne the blode as peper / garlyk / onyons / creſſes / ſauge / myntes percely / and ſuche other / and tho metes that ben to colde freſen the blode / as letuſe / purſylam / gourdes &amp; ſuche other. And yf thy metes ben to watry then they rote the blode / as ben melons / cocumbres / &amp; yf thy metes ben to drye it throweth out thyne vytayle vertues &amp; yf thy metes ben to fatte they lette thy dyſgeſtyon and yf thy metes ben to ſwete they ſtope yt and make the conſtypute &amp; coſtyffe &amp; thy metes ben bytter they nouryſſhe the not. And yf thy metes be to ſalte they brenne noye &amp; breke thy ſtomak and yf thy metes ben to ſoure they make ye ſone olde. For thy none of theſe metes moche &amp; contynuelly vſe is good to helth of mannes body but only that mete is good yt is tēpored &amp; lacketh to mykelneſſe as bē theſe good metes for helth of mānes body &amp; holſō lābe or yonge kyddes ſoukȳg calues hēnes capōs chekȳs ꝑtryches plouers

Alſo borage oxe tonges whete brede well bake &amp; wellauyned &amp; ſomdele ſalted of yt that is one day olde or tweyne &amp; of other that ben not to moche paſſynge in ony qualyte &amp; yf we drede exceſſe of ony qualyte amende it by the contrary therof an inſample yf yu be ſeke of euyll and toughe metes vſe therfore ſharpe metes &amp; ſhorte as a lytell of harde cheſe ſcraped ſmall and of lytell quantyte / &amp; alſo a pere or two or thre of the mooſt beſt fruyte to thy complexion &amp; nature. Sothly ſalte metes ſoure and bytter may be amēded with ſwete apples ſwete metes ben amended with ſwete hony and good olde wyne &amp; ſo of all other and yf thou wylte ete frute ete them faſt cheryſe / grapes and almondes and after mete a fewe peres quynces and nottes a fewe whyle they ben grene and walnottes ben beſt but let ye ſkynne be clene pycked away fro the mete. Alſo the complexyon of a man ſholde be loked to as yf he tempred kepe hym ſo with lyke metes and drynkes and yf it be dyſtempred by his contrarye brynge it lytell and lytle ayen to tempre and for why to ſangweyn men dyſtempred gyue malyncolyous metes and to malyncolyous men ſangweyn metes &amp; to flewmatyk men / colered metes / for euery euyl complexion may be brought to tempre. But yf neceſſaryes of lyuelode let it. And knowe whā yu wylte &amp; note it for a ſouerayne notabylyte / who yt eteth ofte mylk &amp; fyſſhe ofte katche therof a lepre or a whyte ſcabbe. Alſo oft to vſe hye coloured wyne &amp; mylke togyd brīgeth

a man to both lepre and ſcabbe / here none ſuffyſeth of qualyte of metes as to the quantyte / vnderſtond that thy mete ne thy drynke ſholde be no more / but as thy kyndly helthe myghte ouercom it elles / thy body ſhall waſt &amp; thy vertues vexe feble. And for the quantyte of metes drynkes may not certenly be ſpewed loke how thou felyſt it hath done the mooſt good and ſuche quā
                  tyte vſe. ¶Ferdermore vnderſtonde that no man ſholde ete anone after his exercyſe ne anone after he were bathed / but fyrſte reſt hym a whyle ſo that he hungre &amp; thenne whan he wyll ete yf he be a ryche man ſet tofore hym many meetes of whiche yt one is better than that other For a fecyſyon ſayth it ſhal better ſaue hym &amp; beter nouryſſhe hym &amp; ſkyll why for mete yt is taken with delyte the ſtomacke hugely coueyteth haſtely katcheth longe holdeth &amp; well defyeth &amp; that mete that is beſt defyeth is mooſt nouryſſhynge for mannes body. Truly other mete yt is not defyed is taken with fulſō
                  nes &amp; defyeth not well / for why a man deſyre more moton thē a capon ye moton ſhall rather be eten &amp; ſo of all other metes. But there yt is moche dyſtaunce in qualyte of metes we may not doo thus &amp; alſo beware yt it be none erraunt appetyte as in women yt ben with chylde &amp; though it otherwhyle be ye ſhall it not alway be denyed. Ferthermore as Galyen ſayth yt at one mele mē ſholde not ete dyuers metes &amp; therfore at morowe ete but brede alone &amp; at euen fleſſhe alone for whan two dyuers metes ben take at one male of thē come two euylles one in eyther by it ſelfe a nother in them both togyder in themſelfe for then one trauayleth to torne in to grete and heuy humours and that other in to ſubtyll and lyght in them both for if ſubtyll mete go before it

is fyrſt defyed and goeth forth and draweth with hȳ the grete metes vndefyed and yf the grete metes goo fyrſte to fore than the ſubtyll mete is not medefyed &amp; may not for the grete go forth &amp; ſo it wexeth corrupte And whiche of theſe maners euer it be alway it is euyll but more euyll it is that the ſubtyll folowe the grete for the chaufynge / and chaungynge in to kynde of raunes may be holpen / but the chaungynge in to corrupcyon neuer or ſelden and of wonder harde is holpen. ¶And therto accordeth Galyen a fycyſyon &amp; other doctours but neuertheles peraduenture a contraryous cuſtome longe vſed may do awaye the corrupcyon. ¶Alſo wete well that vertue of defyenge is ofte broken whan rawe mete is put on halfe ſoden for thone rawnes ſheueth out the other &amp; ſo the halfe ſoden is corrupte. Moreouer that no man ete ſo moche yt the ſtomak be euyed therwith ne that his appetyte ceaſe. But who yt vſeth grete exercyſe and to moche &amp; ſelde and therwith eteth vnruly and contyneth it he ſhall dye by ſodeyn dethe or ſhall fele wycked ſyknes ye thoughe his mete were ryght good for by cauſe his degeſtyon is corrupte therfore kepe well thy ſtomak from to moche mete &amp; drynke. And it ſo myſhap ony tyme anone with water and oyle of ſuche other ſpue it out anone / and than ſlepe and yf thou may not ſlepe walke ſoftely vp and downe and .xxiiii. houres ete not after / ne drynke not than ete a lytell with a draught of good clene wyne ſo the wyne be not to grete ne of hyghe colour &amp; on the thyrde daye haue ſome exercyſe &amp; be bathed than ete a lytell after &amp; after ſlepe &amp; thou may than vſe this electuare dyatryon as ſayth a fycyſyon. Two cauſe be of ſykeneſſes yt is dyuerſe metes &amp; longe ſyttȳge &amp; moche etȳge of dyuerſe

metes for of them ben gendred dyuers humours ſome good &amp; ſome euyll longe ſyttynge for then the mete yt is fyrſte take is defyed or the laſte begynne to defye and ſo that is defyed draweth with hym to ye lyuer yt is vndefyed and ſo theſe two ben cauſe of grete ſykeneſſes. Alſo as olde wyſe men ſaynge / māſhold neuer ete his fyll at one mele in takynge dyuers metes for as a wyſeman ſayth no thynge is worſe than to multeply metes &amp; ſo to ſytte longe therat for thy he ſayth yt men in olde tyme were ſatyſfyed at morowe wt brede alone &amp; therwt they ſayd reſonably the more mete ſholde be towarde euyn / but the cuſtome were contrary for a uycenne ſayth yt hole men ſholde better ete at ayenſt nyght then on morowe for the kyndly hete is cloſed wtin thē &amp; gadereth about ye bowelles / netheles flewmatyk mē ete not to cold for they nede but lytel exerciſe to meue her kȳdly hete whiche mo weete by the morow But now the mooſt vſage is here agayne &amp; amonge many men it is foūde more holſō to ete by day then by nyght &amp; parauenture yt is ſkyll of cuſtome And therfore thus ſayth a wyſe man ſhort ſouper &amp; lyght ſouper is ſeldē greuous grete ſoupers noyen as leches teche we rede it ofte openly alſo as a uycenne ſayth bytwene two etynges .xi. houres to be is ꝓfytable &amp; ſo ete thryes in two dayes as to daye twyes and to morowe but ones and ſo to contynue forth ſo yt yf errour fall in twyes etynge / and ſoo agayn warde for that one muſt be amē
                  ded by that other ſythe it is harde to lyue without errour in moreouer vnderſtonde that men that haue good vnderſtondynge / etynge for they wolde lyue but they that gone by fleſſhelynes wolde lyue for to ete &amp; ontrary to nature. ¶And wytte thou wel that too a

As be of porke grete venyſon &amp; grete beſtly fyſſhes rough &amp; grete brede ſalte mete fleſſhe halfe ſoden &amp; grete myghty coloured wyne / &amp; yf ye hete of the ſtomacke be feble &amp; yf he haue but lytell exercyſe ye metes aforſayd wolde moch noye hym-but to ſuche a ſtomacke gyue ſubtyll metes as chekens &amp; ſmall fyſſhes of ſtony rennȳge water. rere egges brede well baken &amp; well ſoured ſmall wyne &amp; of clene &amp; oryent colour not depe &amp; ſuche other. ¶But theſe metes ſholde be corrupte of an hote ſtomacke / &amp; yf the vertu dygeſtyffe be in ye mene tyme of dyetyng as capons hennes partryches &amp; ſuche other. Alſo and gouernaūce of helth fle all ceſſyuous metes &amp; namely theſe but yf it be for a medycyne / fle alſo al frutes and all herbes yt ben not good as theſe namely / cole wortes &amp; letuſe for they make malȳcolyous blode Galyē ſayth yt my fader euer forbad me yt I ſholde ete no newe frutes &amp; grene yf I wolde be without ſykeneſſe / &amp; whyle he lyued ſo dyd I &amp; was alſo wtout ſykeneſſe / &amp; whan he was deed I ete frutes &amp; caught ye feuers / &amp; after yt I caught connynge to kepe myſelfe I kepte me from frutes.

               ¶How a man ſholde behaue hym in his drynke.
               THe leſſe ye drynke at mete ye better it is euer ſo it be meſurably taken / for a man ſholde not at mete drynke moche leſt it make mete to ſwȳme in his ſtomak / wherfore mē ſholde drȳke a lytell / ſo yt the mete be well medled &amp; tēpred togyder. And then lette it be a longe whyle or yu drynke ayen / &amp; thā drynke a grete draught at ones ne drynke not to moche after ye fyrſte morcell in no maner of wyſe / but drynke ofte a lytell &amp; a lytel of ſmal clene wyne beſt accordynge to helth &amp; gouernȳge of thy cōplexyon &amp; nature / &amp; for helth of body is clene &amp; ſmall claret wyne not to newe ne to myghty ſo it be wel &amp; proporſyonly tempered with ye quantyte of clene water. More ouer no man be ſo hardy to drynke faſtynge colde water / nor after yt he hath accompanyed with a woman nor after grete trauayle nor after exercyſe tyll he haue fyrſte reſted hym / nor by nyght namely yf he haue gloue tofore / for why longe ſlepe and faſt ſlepynge is cure therto.
            
            
               ¶What ſhall be done after mete.
               AFter whanne thou haſte ete thou ſholdeſt ſtonde or walke a lytell ſoftely vp and downe tyll thy mete goo downe to the botom of the ſtomacke and thenne ſlepe a lytell yf that thou be vſed therto bothe ye day and the nyght namely ſlepe fyrſt on thy ryght ſyde for that is kyndly for thy dygeſtyon ſhall be better for

thēn lyeth thy lyuer vnder thy ſtomack / as fyre vnder a caudron. And after thy fyrſte ſlepe torne on thy lefte ſyde yt thy ryght ſyde may be reſted of thy longe lyeng theron. And whan thou haſt layen theron a good whyle &amp; ſlepte turne ayen on thy ryghte ſyde &amp; there ſlepe all nyght forth / &amp; loke yt thou lye not to ſtreyght ne to croked with thy legges but in a meane bytwene ſtreyght &amp; croked. And in no wyſe lye not vpryght / for thē wyll the ſuperfluytes abyde within the &amp; turne to wycked &amp; greuous euylles contrary to helth. Alſo to ly grouelynge on the wombe is good / ſo yt thy brethe be not greuyd therwt &amp; ye heuyer &amp; the gretter thy mete be &amp; the more thou haſte taken therof / euer the lenger thy nyght ſlepe be &amp; euer the ſubtyler yt thy mete be and ye leſſe thou haue euer the leſſe ſholde thy ſlepe be. For ſlepe is full helpy to olde men for it maketh them moyſt and therfore ſayth Galyen whan he was olde he ete letuſes with ſpyces for he wolde ſlepe the better. More ouer ſlepe is full helpy to the dygeſtyon of thy metes but not anone after that thou haſt eten for thou myghteſt be ſtrangled. Alſo wytte thou that yf a man byfore auauntyſſyed of his body / moche ſlepe then is not gode for hym for it wyll waſte his moyſtenes / and of one thynge beware that to longe ſlepe or to ſhorte febleth a mannes body and breketh it. And after thou haſt etē take no latuaryes nor other hote thynges for they turne thy mete to corrupcyon nor anone after thou haſte ete renne not nor ryde not to faſte for then euery ſtrē
                  ge meuynge thynge turneth thy mete to corrupcyon / alſo ye vertu dygeſtyffe is nouryſſhed thrugh reſt alſo after mete &amp; tofore aſmoch as yu mayſt ſle wrath ſorow &amp; pēcyfulneſſe &amp; ryght as tofore me exercyſes bē good

ſo after mete they noye &amp; reſt is beſt. Moreouer Aueroys ſayth ryght as colde water caſte in a potte boylynge letteth ye boylynge for a tyme / ſo to drynke after mete namely ſone letteth ye dygeſtyon &amp; maketh it to ceaſe for a tyme / &amp; therfore it is not good after mete to drynke moche tyll the mete be defyed / but after mete to ſuffre thruſt ſomwhat is good. And yf yu wylte eaſely voyde thy ſtomacke ſtande after thy ſouper tyll yu be wery or walke a thouſande paces &amp; wytte thou yt glotery &amp; whan thy mete defyeth not well what euer ye caſe be bathynge ne blode lettynge ne exercyſe ben not good but reſt ſlepe abſtynence &amp; dyatryon pypyon. Exercyſe is not good for therby ſholde thycke rawe humours be lole &amp; then therof the lymmes ſholde be nouryſſhed &amp; yt were euyll / for why in ſuche exercyſe ye kyndly hete is not comforted but more febled &amp; ſtraūglyd for ye rawe humours are dyſſolued for ryght as water quencheth fyre ſo rawe humours quencheth kyndly helth.
