            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            To the right honourable Henrie, Earle of SOVTHAMPTON, Baron of TICHEFIELD, Knight of the moſt honourable Order of the Garter, and Gouernour of the Iſle of WIGHT.
            
               BEhold (right honourable) the Sermons now publiſhed, which were pronounced by your Lordſhips appointment, in a very ſacred preſence. The gratious allowance which then they receiued from a royall diuine, giueth me hope that they will not be vnwelcome to the Church, entertaining all meditations with facilitie, that aduance Christ, her Bridegroome, Patron, and delight. What was intended in them to this purpoſe, he knoweth beſt that knoweth all things: If any thing be attained, that ſhall alwaies be aſcribed thankfully to his goodneſſe, and ſubmitted willingly to her cenſure. With this obedience

I haue determined to liue, and deſire to die. In the meane time, they come abroad vnder the paſſe alſo of your Lordſhips authoritie, as of my honourable Magiſtrate. Were they iuſt volumes, and of any great requeſt, your Lordſhip were more than worthy of them, for that heroiacall zeale wherewith you haue adorned our little Sarepta. Now making ſcarſe a pamphlet, they are the leſſe worthy of a noble patron: But I haue had true experience that your Lordſhip accepteth the poore indeuours of our miniſterie aboue their worth. Therefore recommending them to your Lordſhips good fauour, and your Lordſhip to the riches of Gods bleſſing, I take my leaue with reuerence, and will rest
            
               Your Lordſhips moſt affectionately deuoted, CHRISTOPHER HAMPTON.
               
            
         
      
      
         
            
            A SERMON PREAched before the King at BEAVLIE in Hampſhire.
            
            
               
                  
                     ROM. 10.4.
                  
                  Christ is the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe to euery one that beleeueth.
               
            
            
               IT is not vnknowen vnto you, that the Doctrine of free iuſtification is the principall ſubiect and matter of this Epiſtle.
            The Iewes, whom the Apoſtle ſpake of in the beginning of the Chapter, were afraid to come to this righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, leſt they ſhould be iniurious to the Law, and offend God, that had commanded it ſo ſeriouſly to the Fathers.
            The Apoſtle anſwereth, that this their feare proceeded from ignorance of Gods righteouſneſſe, and

their owne Law: and addeth a reaſon in theſe words of my Text; For Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe to euery one that beleeueth.
            
               Quicquid eſt veteris Teſtamenti, Chriſtum ſonat: All the Old Teſtament (as Auguſtine ſaies) ſounds of Chriſt. The Ceremonies are nothing but figures of him: he is the kernell of the promiſe; they are all in him Yea and Amen; and without him no promiſe hath accompliſhment. He is the life and ſoule, and perfection and end of all the Commandements.
            And therefore hee that hath Chriſt, and holdeth him by faith, hath all that the Law requireth in precepts, offreth in promiſes, and ſhadoweth out in types and figures.
            The points in this text are conſiderable:
            
               
                  1 The prerogatiue that Chriſt hath aboue the Law: he is the end of the Law.
                  2 The benefit thereof: for righteouſneſſe.
                  3 To whom this benefit perteines: to euerie one that beleeueth.
               
            
            Excellent things are ſpoken of the Law. If thou wilt enter into euerlaſting life (ſaith Chriſt vnto a Lawyer) keepe the Commandements. So ſaith Moſes;
               Denter. 6 Behold, this ſhall be our righteouſneſſe before the Lord our God, If we take heed to all theſe Commandements, to doe them.
            Whereby wee may perceiue, that faire and large promiſes are annexed to the Law. What is fairer than righteouſneſſe? What larger than euerlaſting life? But they are conditionall, and not abſolute: Si potes dicere, Feci quod iuſsiſti, potes itidem dicere, Redde quod promiſiſti: If thou canſt ſay, I haue done that

which thou commandeſt, thou maiſt well ſay, Giue me that thou promiſeſt.
            On the other ſide, if the Law be not obſerued, and that exquiſitely too, the threats thereof are all as terrible. Curſed is euery one that abideth not in all that is written in the Law, to doe them.
            Hard conditions, of doing, and doing all.
            And if you pleaſe that wee ſhall enter into the queſtion, whether wee can performe the Law, or not; Paul anſwereth, that it is a matter not of difficulties;Rom. 8, for that might be compaſſed with endeuour, but of impoſſibilitie; 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ; that which was impoſſible for the Law to doe. And hee giueth a reaſon thereof in the former chapter: The Law is ſpirituall, and I am carnall. Now theſe two be contraries. For the fleſh euermore luſteth againſt the ſpirit:Galat. witneſſe the ſame Apoſtle, not in words onely, but in true experience alſo. For hee felt a Law in his members rebelling againſt the Law of God, and leading him captiue. When this elect Veſſell, and great Apoſtle, after he was regenerate (for the vnregenerate feele no ſuch ſtrife) found this long diſtance betweene the Law and his owne affections; and ſuch defects, that for horrour thereof he cried our, O miſerable man that I am! may wee attend any good performance or complement of the Law in others?
            
               Steuen challengeth the whole Nation of the Iewes;Act. 7. You haue receiued the Law, and haue not kept it. His words carry the ſtrength and ſinewes of an argument. That which is not kept, cannot iuſtifie: But you haue not kept the Law: therefore what boaſt ſoeuer you doe make thereof, that you receiued it from GOD,

that it was publiſhed by Angels, and giuen to the Fathers, yet doth it not iuſtifie; it giues you no prerogatiue. They could not anſwer this with reaſon, and therefore fell into paſſion and outrage: the text ſaith, When they heard theſe things, their hearts burſt aſunder, and they gnaſhed vpon him with their teeth: Manifeſt euidence of conuiction.
            
               Act. 15.
               Peter calleth the keeping of the Law, an importable yoke, and conteſteth againſt thoſe which vrged the performance thereof for iuſtification, that they laid a taske vpon the necks of their brethren, which neither they nor their fathers were able to beare.
            If the Law could be performed, why doth Peter call it an importable yoke? If it cannot bee performed, why is righteouſneſſe ſought or placed in it? For it is not the hearing or hauing, but the doing of the Law, that iuſtifieth.
            Sinne (as Iohn defineth it) is a tranſgreſſion of the Law: And doe not all men ſinne? It were a ſinne for any man to ſay, he hath no ſinne: and if we confeſſe our ſinnes, what do we confeſſe, but that we are tranſgreſſors, and not performers of the Law?
            Shall we put the matter to a triall, and let all the ſaints in heauen and earth paſſe vpon the Iurie?
            O Lord, let them bee demanded heere in thy preſence, if it were by their workes, or fulfilling of the Law, that they were iuſtified. Haue they not all with one voice returned their verdict? Not vnto vs, O Lord, not vnto vs, but vnto thy name giue the praiſe, for thy louing mercy, and for thy truths ſake.
            Where is Iames, or Iohn, or one of the ſonnes of thunder, to ſet foorth the dreadfulneſſe of the Law?

For I am ſcarſe able to giue you a taſte thereof; but by a little you can conceiue the reſt. Looke then to the concuſſion of the Iſraelites, 19. and 20. chap. of Exodus, when the Law was eſtabliſhed, they came with great endeuour, in faſting, ſanctifying, and preparing themſelues: yet when they beheld with what maieſty and terrour it was publiſhed, how the mountaine ſmoaked, the thunders roared, the lightnings flaſhed, the trumpets ſounded, and the earth trembled; they cried out, We ſhall die, we ſhall die. And this was no vaine feare, but a true ſenſible feeling of the rigor and ſeueritie of the Law.
            Come then yee Iuſticiaries, that are ſo fooliſhlie zealous of the Law: Compare your ſelues, not with your ſelues (for that may proue to be a falſe meaſure) but compare your ſelues with theſe Iſraelites; and that is no diſparagement.
            They were afraid of the Law, when it was publiſhed; and how dare you preſume, when it is exacted? They could not endure the proclamation of the Law; And will you abide the execution? Vpon what confidence? Are your workes anſwerable to the exquiſite triall thereof? Alas, alas, I will not abaſe them with ſuch termes as the Scripture would affoord: But make them as glorious as you can; couer them with grace; deriue them from the holy Ghoſt; dip them and die them in the blood of Chriſt; apparrell them with all the iewels, attire, and habil
                  •
               ments, that the Church of Rome hath beſtowed vpon them: yet you ſhall finde them but hay, chaffe, and ſtubble, that will bee deuoured in the firie triall of the Law: you ſhall finde them but humane righteouſneſſe: you ſhal

haue no more vſe of them in the buſineſſe of iuſtification, than Dauid had of Sauls armour, when he went to encounter with Goliah. It made a ſhew to others, but hindred Dauid, that he could not goe with it.
            Such poore helpes, and no better, haue all they that eſtabliſh their owne righteouſneſſe, and are not ſubiect to the righteouſneſſe of God.
            I can reſemble the Law to nothing better, than to the man in the Goſpell, that would be brought to no other ſong, than to thoſe ſad and vnwelcome tunes of Solue quod debes.
            
            Oh Lord, who can abide the harſhneſſe of thoſe ſharpe notes! Who ſhall euer bee able to ſatisfie the rigorous exactions of ſuch an vnmercifull Creditor! When the Law ſhall require the vttermoſt farthing moſt imperiouſly, and we not able to anſwer one for a thouſand tolerably: you can eaſily conceiue, what heauy ſentence, what loathſome priſon, what tragicall paines, what weeping and wailing, what gnaſhing of teeth, what vnquenchable fire, what euer-gnawing, and neuer-dying worme, muſt follow neceſſarily.
            What then? Is the Law idle? or is God altogether rigorous, that propoſeth a Law which cannot be performed? Neither of both.
            God made a Law like vnto himſelfe: holy, becauſe he is holy; pure, becauſe he is pure; perfect, becauſe he is perfect; eternall, becauſe he is eternall: and added that condition alſo which a great Law-giuer requireth in all Lawes: 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               : Hee made it poſſible, for that integritie of nature wherein God created vs. For God made man right.
            
               If that poſſibilitie bee now taken away from the Law; if our nature be wounded; if it be diſabled; if our fathers haue eaten ſowre grapes, and all our teeth bee ſet on edge; if wee haue loſt that integritie that GOD gaue vnto vs; let him be free: for he is light, and in him dwelleth no darkneſſe: let vs not charge him fooliſhly, but condemne our owne preuarication iuſtly.
            For ſo it was, as if a man ſhould leaue a great ſumme of money to one whoſe eſtate was then good, and ſufficient to make reſtitution: if afterward, through prodigalitie, riot, or vnthriftineſſe, he miſſpent or waſted his eſtate, and left himſelfe no meanes of repaiment, can either the accuſation of the creditors crueltie, that demands nothing but his owne, or the excuſe of the debtors inabilities, be iuſt? Euen ſo the Law was propoſed to man, created after the Image and ſimilitude of God, with perfect righteouſneſſe, and true holineſſe, and indowments, to performe the ſame.
            If afterward wee haue miſ-ſpent our patrimonie, and waſted our fathers ſubſtance, with the prodigall ſonne; if we haue caſt our ſelues into the hands of theeues and cut-throats, that haue bereaued vs of all meanes to giue ſatisfaction; wee may deplore our owne infelicitie; wee cannot except againſt God, or his Law, Was it not poſſible?
            Grant this, and then you diſcharge God from all imputation: denie it, and then you infringe, abate, and detract from Adams perfection, which the Scripture celebrateth.
            Thus you ſee, that the Law was poſſible: but it is

now made weake by our fleſh, which is reſtife, wayward, refractarie, and yet the inſtrument wherewith the Law doth worke.
            As for example, The Law would haue God to be loued aboue all things: The fleſh ſaies ſhe is neereſt and deareſt to her ſelfe.
            The Law would haue the fleſh brought into ſubiection, and crucified: The fleſh is like Diotre
                     •
                  hes, that loues to haue the preheminence, and will carrie no croſſe, but as Simon of Cyrene did, to crucifie another, and not himſelfe.
            
               Dalila neuer practiſed more treacherouſly between Sampſon and the Philiſtines, than euery mans owne fleſh doth againſt the Law of God, with the capitall enemie thereof; diſcouering who thirſteth with couetouſneſſe, who ſwelleth in pride, who burneth with luſt, who pineth away with enuy: and then the ſerpent that is more ſubtle than all the beaſts that GOD created, when hee ploweth with euery mans heifer, doth eaſily diſſolue their riddles.
            
               Omnes amici, omnes inimici, omnes neceſſarij, omnes aduerſarij, omnes domeſtici, nulli pacifici: All the affections of the fleſh be friends, and all are enemies, all neceſſarie, and all aduerſarie, all domeſticall, none peaceable. And is it poſſible that we ſhould flie to the marke of righteouſneſſe, or to the end of the Law, when our feathers are thus glude together with birdlime?
            Ah proud and wayward fleſh! Why doeſt thou ſpurne, and luſt, and murmur againſt the Law? If it humble thee for a time, is it not becauſe it would aduance thee for euer?
            
               Go too Agar, ſubmit your ſelfe to your miſtreſſe Sara: ſuffer the law: endure the rod and ferula of the ſchoolemaſter; or rather, labour together with it, that thou maiſt alſo raigne with it.
            But the belly hath no eares; and in vaine doe wee heere looke for that which is due elſewhere, and in another place: heere wee doe fight, wee doe not triumph. And I would to God we did fight manfullie; for then we ſhall be ſure of conqueſt at the laſt. One thing is certaine, that our whole battell is like to that of Gedeons in the booke of Iudges. Theſe earthen pitchers that wee carry, muſt be broken, before wee can winne the field. As long as theſe houſes of clay bee whole, looke for no perfection to hold correſpondencie with the law: looke for nothing but imperfections to fruſtrate the law of her end.
            Put off the old man, and put on the new: waſh away all birdlime of concupiſcence: crucifie your earthly members: tame the fleſh, &amp; bring it into true ſubiection; that the law may ſay, goe, and it goeth; come, and it commeth; doe this, and it doth ſo: then you ſhall finde no defect in the law.
            O that all weakneſſe were ſo taken away from this ſinfull fleſh of mine! O that all the ſores thereof were in this ſort healed! Should not I then run the way of the Commandements?
            But this the law cannot doe: it rather diſcouereth them, and aggrauateth their ſinne, and makes it out of meaſure ſinfull: not vnprofitable; for if the diſeaſe were light, it would be contemned: then remedy would not be ſought, and ſo no cure. Lex data est, vt gratia quaereretur: gratia data eſt, vt lex impleretur.
            
            
               I remember the ſtory of Elizeus in the booke of the Kings. He was a Prophet, and prophecied, as well by his deeds, as in his words. The Shunamites ſon was dead; it was told the Prophet; he ſent his ſtaffe by his ſeruant; Goe lay it vpon the childes face; but the dead receiued no life. The Prophet knew what hee did, that the ſtaffe would not be ſufficient, and therefore came himſelfe.
            The law is like to Elizeus ſtaffe: though it were appointed, and Elizeus ſent it to giue life, yet did it not giue life. For if there had beene a law that could giue life, then righteouſneſſe ſhould haue come by the law. Now wee are all like to the Shunamites childe, dead in ſinne. Come then Elizeus, and raiſe the dead: ſend not thy ſtaffe by any ſeruant: but come thy ſelfe. Come, come, O pittifull and ſweet Samaritane, heale this poore hurt creature; powre in wine and oile. The Prieſt ſaw it, and paſſed by: the Leuite looked vpon it, but no offices of the law had compaſſion. Come therefore, come courteous Samaritane; for there is mercy with thee. Binde vp my ſores, ſet mee vpon thine owne beaſt: but leaue me not with any Hoſt or In-keeper. For whom haue I in heauen but thee? and there is none on earth that I deſire, in compariſon of thee. Numquid poſſunt ſanare languores meos? Therfore take charge of me thy ſelfe. Say vnto me (o thou preſeruer of mankinde) ſay vnto my ſoule, I am thy ſaluation: but ſay it ſo that I may heare. Open mee the gates of righteouſneſſe, and I will enter therein,
            That which the law could not doe, becauſe it was made weake through our fleſh, God ſent his ſonne to doe. He ſent Chriſt to be the end of the law. He ſent

no ſeruant about it. Moſes indeed was faithfull in all his houſe, but his tongue was heauy, and not eloquent enough to treat of ſuch a cauſe. Eſaies lips were vncleane; Ieremie was a childe, and could not ſpeake; all the Prophets were tongue-tied; and the Angels themſelues were vnable to entertaine the matter for vs. When Angels were fallen, could Angels mediate their owne reſtitution?
            Then can they neuer bee competent for vs, that were inſufficient for themſelues.
            To be vmpeere betweene God and man, to make appointment and tranſaction of their differences, to ſuſtaine the wrath of the one, and the miſeries of the other (and that a mediatour muſt doe) is certainlie beyond the capacitie and compaſſe of euery creature.
            Verily none but God can plead with God: the ſon with the father: God mercifull, with God iuſt: God pleaſed, with God offended.
            May I craue your honourable leaue and patience, to informe you of a ſharpe contention? and it ſhall not bee impertinent to this buſineſſe that I treat of. Truth and righteouſnes contend for the puniſhment of mankinde with peace and mercy, pleading for his deliuerance.
            Whole Adam (ſaith Iuſtice) muſt die, becauſe whole Adam hath offended. And if regard be not had of my ſiſter truth and my ſelfe, yet may not the word be infringed that is gone out of the mouth of God, In what day ſoeuer thou ſhalt eat of this fruit, thou ſhalt die the death.
            Mercy maketh anſwer, that if the matter ſhould go ſo, and no commiſeration taken, but that whole mankinde

muſt be condemned, then why were Peace and I brought into the world to bee cut away ſo ſoone againe?
            Reply was made by Truth, that Mercy had zeale indeed, but not according to knowledge. For in pittie towards mankinde, ſhee is cruell to Iuſtice and mee that are her ſiſters; deſiring to haue him ſpared, and vs aboliſhed. For it is not poſſible for vs to conſiſt without this puniſhment.
            The controuerſie is difficult, and happily ſome doe wiſh for Salomon to decide it. But a greater than Salomon was there; yet that could not hold them from bitterneſſe, till Peace had reprooued both ſides, and told them, that contention was vnbeſeeming vertues and ſiſters. All this while the Iudge was ſtooping downe, and writing vpon the ground. The tenour of his writing was this, as Peace did read it:
            The one ſide ſayes, that all mankinde muſt die, or elſe Righteouſneſſe and Truth cannot liue: The other ſide ſayes, that in caſe mankind die, Mercy and Peace muſt periſh with them.
            This is my ſentence: Fiat mors bona, &amp; habet vtra
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   pars quod petebat. All wondered at the wiſdome and integritie of the deciſion. But the remedie was as hard as the diſeaſe. That death ſhould bee made good, it was impoſſible, vnleſſe ſuch a one ſhould vndertake the buſineſſe, that was not indebted to death. And where ſhould he be found? Verily none can giue aid, but he that gaue counſell. And ſo they had recourſe vnto the ſonne of God, who turning to his father, ſaid, Sacrifice and burnt-offering thou wouldeſt not haue, but haſt fitted mee vp a body for this death. In

the volume of thy booke it is written of mee, that I ſhould fulfill thy will. O my God, I am content to do it. So he put his owne deciſion in practiſe. Then Mercy and Truth met together; Righteouſneſſe and Peace kiſſed each other. Hee was that ladder that Iacob did ſee joining heauen and earth together. Where the law ended in curſing and imprecation, becauſe it was not obſerued, there Chriſt began, and redeemed vs from the curſe of the law, and was made a curſe for vs.
            He did heerein as in the matter of Tribute, when it was demanded; although he were free as the ſonne of a King, yet becauſe wee will leaue none offenſe, Goe Peter, take this peece of twenty pence, and pay for me and thee. O bone Domine Ieſu, O good Lord Ieſus, wilt thou indeed pay for thee and me? for that which thou ſaideſt vnto Peter, thou ſayeſt vnto euery one of thy Church: take it, and pay it for thee and me.
            And for the
                  •
               e the paiment is ſoone made, becauſe thou waſt born, free. But my ſinne is great; and is not my redemption plenteous? I haue tranſgreſſed the whole law; and haue not I fulfilled it too a little? But the reward of ſinne is death; and is there any gall of bitterneſſe in that cup whereof I haue not taſted? Wherefore was all this done? Was it for my ſelfe? I will not bee a witneſſe in mine owne cauſe. Aske mine enemies that were chiefe actors in the buſineſſe. They will not be partiall. Did not Pilate pronounce from his tribunall, that hee found no cauſe of death in me? Was not this a part of Caiaphas cenſure, that it was expedient that I ſhould die for the people?
            Take him then, good Chriſtian brother, and pay for thee and me. Hee is the firſt fiſh that commeth

from the ſea of death. Verily, the firſt begotten amongſt the dead. Open his life and death, and whatſoeuer puniſhment yee finde in the one, or righteouſneſſe in the other, take it all, and pay it for thee and me.
            What, both death and life? Is not the one of them ſufficient? There is a rule, that the law doth binde either to obedience, or to puniſhment. So if the one of the diſiunctiues, or the other, be performed, the law is ſatisfied, and come to her end.
            This rule hath place in humane lawes amongſt light offenſes. There, if the law cannot haue obedience, it hath ſome ſatisfaction by puniſhment: but then it writes, Contented, and not Pleaſed. For the chiefe end whereunto all lawes doe aime, is to haue obedience, and thereby to make men good, which cannot bee done in humane lawes, when the offenſe is generall, and the puniſhment capitall.
            In the law of God, eſpecially concerning the buſineſſe of Iuſtification, the rule of diſiunctiues hath no place. This law hath not her end, vnleſſe ſhe be contented and pleaſed too. Contented, for the ſins that we haue committed; and pleaſed, with the obedience that is required. Chriſt is the end of the law: therefore he hath performed both.
            Well might the law be contented with the death of Chriſt, becauſe there was as much atrocitie in that, as in the ſinnes of the whole world. I willingly vſe this reaſon now, to giue you to vnderſtand, that I concurre not with their opinion, that thinke, if the ſonne of God had ſhed but one drop of blood, it had beene price enough for all our ſinnes.
            
               I doubt whether the law would haue beene contented with one drop of blood. Ought not Chriſt to ſuffer all theſe things, and ſo to enter into glory? Was not the whole burnt offring a figure of his ſufferings? And that muſt be all conſumed.
            I looke into the counſell of God, what was there ſet downe for ſatisfaction of the law. And I carrie and giue ſuch reuerence to the wiſdome and iuſtice thereof, that whatſoeuer is wanting of that which is there ſet downe, I verily beleeue to be inſufficient.
            I looke to the fact of Chriſt. Exinaniuit ſeipſum: He emptied himſelfe. And I am loth to beleeue, that either the father was ſo prodigall of his ſonnes life, or that the ſonne was ſo careleſſe of his owne blood, that he would haue powred out all, if one drop might haue ſerued the turne. Admit this, and then Chriſt died in vaine.
            But euery thing that the ſonne of God did, was of infinite value, for the dignitie of his perſon.
            The dignitie of his perſon is great, and hath goodly vſe: but it may not be ſtretched too farre, leſt the buffets that he receiued on his face be reckoned price enough for our redemption. Hydra peccati vno icta non tollitur: Then monſter of ſinne will not be ſlaine with one blow.
            Hee made vs indeed at a moment, and with great facilitie: for he ſpake the word, and they were made; he commanded, and they were created. But did hee redeeme vs ſo ſoone? No, no; it coſt him three and thirtie yeeres worke, and O Lord, what labours! What ſorrowes! What watchings! What hunger! What thirſt! What temptations! What praiers!

What ſtrong cries! What groanes! What indignities! What ſcourgings! What agonies! And after all theſe, what a bitter death! I dare bee bold to ſay, that there was as much atrocitie in all theſe, as in the ſinnes of the whole world. And therefore the law might well be contented, for matter of puniſhment, with the death of Chriſt.
            
               Dubitas quod dabit tibi bona ſua, qui non dedignatus est ſuſciperemala tua?
            
            Adde then heereunto his perpetuall obedience to the law of God, neuer intermitted in the whole tenor of his life: and then Chriſt is the end and perfection of the law: hee hath contented it, and pleaſed it too.
            Hee died indeed vpon the Croſſe, and in my nature, and for my ſinnes of humane infirmitie But he brought withall ſuch a troupe and legion of vertues to his Croſſe, as might well giue righteouſneſſe to the whole world.
            Time will not ſerue to rehearſe euery one: but the vertues wherewith he adorned the foure corners of his croſſe are ſo conſpicuous, that I cannot omit them.
            
               Supereminentior eſt charitas: Loue takes the higheſt place, and is ſet on the top of his croſſe. Maiorem charitatem nemo habet: None can haue greater loue, than to lay downe his life for his friends: None verily but he himſelfe, that laid it downe for his enemies.
            On the right hand of the croſſe hee ſet obedience, whereof hee was ſo reſpectiue, that hee did chuſe to loſe his life rather than his obedience. And if obedience were better than ſacrifice, when the chiefe worſhip of God was in ſacrifice, as Samuel telleth Saul,
               
and yet that obedience was commanded, &amp; humane obedience; how pleaſing was the diuine obedience of the ſonne of God, that was neuer commanded, alwaies voluntary, alwaies indebita?
            
            Patience ſtandeth at the left ſide: As a ſheepe led to the ſlaughter, ſo opened he not his mouth: he opened it not in outcries or imprecations; he contended not with them in reuenge or malice, but in pietie: they refuſed him, and he died for them: they contended with Pilate, when hee would haue deliuered him, Crucifige, crucifige, Crucifie him, crucifie him: and he contendeth with his father when hee had iuſt cauſe to deſtroy them, Pater ignoſce, pater ignoſce: Father forgiue them, father forgiue them. Hee regarded more that he died for them, than that he died by them.
            In the bottome of his Croſſe hee placed humilitie, the foundation of all vertues, that if we will not learn to be humble in the ſchooles of men, wee may now practiſe it by the precedent and patterne of an humble God. His quatuor v
                     •
                  rtutum gommis ditauit trophaeum Crucis. When he had thus enriched the foure corners of his Croſſe, he placed himſelfe in the midſt of all, no more now as a ſtone of offenſe, but as a loadſtone to draw all the world vnto it. So hee ſayes, Ego ſi exaltatus f
                     •
                  ero, omnia traham ad meipſum.
            
            Draw vs, O Lord, vnto thee, and wee ſhall run in the ſauour of thine ointments.
            Couer vs with the mantle of thy righteouſneſſe, which is the true wedding garment, that when the Bridegrome comes to take view of his gueſts, we may not be caſt out into vtter darknes, but ſit with thee, eating and drinking at thy table in thy kingdome.
            
               Hitherto ye haue heard Chriſts prerogatiue, and the benefit therof. The laſt point remaineth, to whom this benefit belongs: to euery one that beleeueth.
            Why then ſay the Ieſuites, the promiſes of Chriſt are conditionall, as well as the promiſes of the Law? The law ſayes, Doe this, and liue: Chriſt ſayes, Beleeue only, and all things are poſſible to him that beleeueth.
            Heere is a condition in the one, as well as in the other.
            If time would giue me leaue, I could ſhew that the promiſes of Chriſt are abſolute, and without condition: but let vs now admit that they are conditionall, as well as the promiſes of the law: yet haue we many aduantages in this condition of Chriſt, that are not in the law.
            1 Is it not much eaſilier to beleeue the promiſes of the one, than to doe the workes of the other?
            2 Againe, the law is ſtoicall and curious, not content with our endeuours, vnleſſe wee haue done all, and done it moſt exactly.
            Chriſt is milde and gentle; he ſtriueth not, lifteth not vp his voice, quencheth not ſmoaking flax, bruſeth not a ſhaken reede; but enterteineth euery true faith, though it be as little as a graine of muſtard ſeed, though it be neuer ſo vnperfect.
            3 The law is ſolitarie, teacheth vs what to doe, but giueth vs no meanes to doe it: whereupon the Apoſtle cals it a dead letter.
            Chriſt is neuer ſolitarie, but accompanied with the grace and influence of his holy ſpirit, which hee ſends into our hearts, to illuminate, to regenerate, &amp;

to giue vs faith to comprehend him. And therefore when he giueth vs the condition which he requireth of vs, his condition is moſt gracious, and the condition of the Law is grieuous. Chriſt is the end of the law for righteouſneſſe to euery one that beleeueth.
            If Chriſt bee the end of the law to euery one that beleeueth, then did he not fulfill the law for himſelfe, but for thoſe that doe beleeue.
            As he was God, he was not ſubiect to the law, and as he was man alſo, he was Lord of the law.
            
               Duplici iure (ſayes Bernard) filius Dei regnum poſsidet coelorum. Semel quia filius; 2. quia paſſus: at
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   hoc ſecundo modo nihil illi fuit opus, mihi autem dedit, &amp; omnibus credentibus: The ſonne of God hath two titles and rights to the kingdome of heauen: The firſt is by inheritance, becauſe he is ſonne; the ſecond is by acquiſition, becauſe he ſuffered: of this ſecond title he had no vſe or need himſelfe, but hath giuen it to me, and all that beleeue.
            This will eaſily be yeelded, that hee ſuffred for vs; but the other point is controuerted, that hee fulfilled the law for himſelfe, and for his owne righteouſneſſe.
            As God, he needed not; and as man alſo, hee was Lord of the Sabboth. The ſonne of man is Lord of the Sabboth, and ſo conſequently of the whole law. Eadem eſt ratio partium &amp; totius.
            
            If Lord of the law, as man, then needed hee not to be ſubiect: but hee made himſelfe. So the Apoſtle writeth to the Galathians: but he addeth the reaſon of Chriſt his ſubiection; that hee might redeeme vs that were vnder the law.
            When the humane nature in the very moment of

conception thereof, was vnited inſeparably to the Godhead, what felicitie did it want in that vnion, which might be ſupplied by his actuall righteouſnes, &amp; fulfilling of the law? What, was not the law to be performed of euery man? or was not Chriſt a man?
            The law verily was enioined to euery humane perſon; but Deus verbum (as Augustine ſayes) non ſuſcepit perſonam, ſed naturam hominis: and this nature hauing no ſubſiſtance at any time of it ſelfe, but aſſoone as it began to bee, it was perſonated, as they ſay in the ſchooles of the diuinitie, could not bee brought into neceſſarie ſubiection of the law, without manifeſt iniurie to that perſon that ſuſteineth it.
            
               Piſcator.Others write, that Chriſt muſt fulfill the law, to make himſelfe a meet high Prieſt: and they doe not conſider his natiue innocencie that hee brought with him into the world, which being neuer te
                  •
               erated, was ſufficient to qualifie him to the office of Prieſthood.
            Was he not by that natiue integritie, holy, harmleſſe, vndefiled, ſeparated from ſinners? And theſe be all the qualities that the Apoſtle to the Hebrewes requireth in his high
                  •
               Prieſthood.
            Seeing then hee had all theſe by the ſacred conception, which wee profeſſe, I may conclude, that all which he did beſide in fulfilling of the law, was as the text noteth, for righteouſneſſe to euery one that belleeueth; and as it is in 8. Rom. that the exquiſite righteouſneſſe of the law might be fulfilled in vs.
            
               Ioh. 17.So he ſayes himſelfe; E
                     •
                  o procis ſanctifica meipſum: It is for them, and not for mine owne behoofe, that I ſanctifie my ſelfe.
            
               As it is in a glaſſe, that hath not his brightneſſe and reflexions for himſelfe, but that others may haue the vſe and benefit of it; ſo is Chriſt the end of the law for righteouſneſſe, not to himſelfe, or for his owne benefit, but for the vſe and commodity of euery one that beleeueth. Thus I haue deliuered you Chriſt the end of the law for righteouſneſſe to euery one that beleeueth. Hee is a high Prieſt, according to the order of Melch
                     •
                  ſedeth. And wee read nothing of the exerciſe of that Prieſthood, but only that he bleſſed Abraham; to giue vs to vnderſtand, that the whole Prieſthood of Ieſus Chriſt doth conſiſt in bleſſing. Hold him therefore, and let him not goe, vntill hee haue giuen you a bleſſing, which hee hath already graciouſly begun heere in this world, and will multiplie it aboue all that you can deſire in the Kingdome of Heauen. Whereunto wee doe all with heart and voice ſay, Amen.
            
            Euen ſo be it, Lord Ieſus, who with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt liueſt and raigneſt one God bleſſed for euer.

                it was indeed miraculous, to ſee a man abſent beyond all reach and compaſſe of humane eies; yet a thing that the ſonne of God had communicated to others, that did the like. Elizeus ſitting at home within doores, did ſee Gebezi his ſeruant taking bribes of N

                  man the Sirian in his iourney.
            But the opening of heauen, the carriage of vs to God, and the whole buſineſſe of a mediator, promiſed in theſe words of my text to a true Iſraelite, is of more conſequence and difficultie, not communicated to Patriarch, Prophet, Apoſtle, Martyr, or any Saint, but reſerued onely for the ſonne of God, as a marke of his ſoueraigntie.
            
               Verily, verily, I ſay vnto you, heereafter ſhall you ſee heauen open, and the Angels of God aſcending and deſcending vpon the ſonne of man. He alludeth to that which Iacob did ſee in a dreame:Geneſ. 28 A ladder ſtand vpon the ground: the top did reach to heauen: the Angels of God did goe vp and downe by it, and the Lord was at the top thereof.
            A mans dreame ſhould not bee regiſtred for perpetuall

memorie, if it did not conteine ſome notable myſterie. Hic habent &amp; ſomnia pondus: In ſuch caſes dreames alſo haue their weight. The ladder heere repreſenteth Iacobs iourney. He was then going to his vncle Laban. The Angels are his guard, aſcending to protect him outward; deſcending to bee his guides backe againe: and the Lord was at the top of the ladder, as a gracious moderator of both Loe then a comfortable ſafe-conduct for a traueller.
            And becauſe our whole life is a very pilgrimage, for we haue no certaine place of abode, but we trauell and ſeeke for it in Hieruſalem that is aboue; the ſonne of God heere vnder the impreſe and hieroglifique of Iacobs ladder, doth promiſe vs his meanes and mediation: and that is the matter that now we ſhall treat of. Wherein hee doth not draw vs along with naked hopes, but firſt of all conſigneth the certainty of his promiſe with the religion and ſolemnitie of an oath, Verily, verily: ſo the Apoſtle calleth this ſacred aſſeneration.
            When God made the promiſe vnto Abraham,
               Heb. 6. and had no greater to ſweare by, hee ſware by himſelfe: How? Verily I will bleſſe thee. And heere is the ſame forme. Therefore Chriſti iuramentum eſt ſidei nostrae fundamentum; We haue Chriſt his oath for the foundation of our faith. The word or God is as certaine as his oath: he is not as man, that he ſhould lie,Num. 23. nor as the ſonne of man, that he ſhould repent. Heauen and earth may paſſe, but no word of God falleth to the ground: all his promiſes are Yea and Amen. So that for the thing it ſelfe, ſuch religious conteſtations needed not: but his oath is added (as the Apoſtle

ſaith) that we might haue valid

Hee ſeeth the darkneſſe of our mindes, the leuitie of our affections, the manifold ſleights wherewith Satan doth abuſe vs. Sometimes by aggrauating our ſinnes, he drowneth vs in a very hell of deſperation: ſometimes bewitching vs with a perſwaſion of righteouſnes, he carrieth vs aboue the clouds in pride. Cui nomina mille, mille nocendt artes. The ſon of God, the wiſdome of his father, that of loue gaue himſelfe for vs, and had experience both waies, of the aduerſaries practiſes, and our infirmities, to helpe all, and to put vs out of doubt,Tertull. interpoſeth an oath, Iurat Deus, capit ſibi credi.

And o thriſe vnhappy if we beleeue not God when he ſweareth! The atteſtation of the ſonne of God teacheth vs, that in the buſineſſe of our ſaluation, and in the promiſes of Chriſt, wee ſhould not be Academies. They were a kinde of Philoſophers (you know) that would not be certaine of any thing, but doubtfull and vncertaine in all things; and that vncertaintie is not ſutable with our promiſes.

            Is it poſſible that God ſhould become a changeling? that his purpoſe ſhould be fruſtrate? his power

infringed? his decree reuerſed? his prouidence deceiued? that the merit of Chriſt ſhould be euacuated? the authenticall ſeale of the holy Ghoſt cancelled? and the oath of the ſonne of God to be of none effect? All this aſſurance wee haue. And if none of theſe be poſſible, let the Romaniſts diſable them all with their Academicall doubtfulneſſe; when as in the meane time they applaud themſelues, ſacrifice to their owne net, and burne incenſe to their yarne: but let them eleuate the promiſes of Chriſt with their vncertaine hopes, and ratifie their owne traditions with great aſſurance: Ioſua and his houſe will firmlie beleeue that which the ſonne of God hath ſworne ſolemnly. And heere is no arrogance, but deuotion: to beleeue that which is promiſed ſo ſeriouſly, is not preſumption, but faith: we know whom we beleeue, and are certaine that hee is true in his promiſes, and moſt mightie in his performance. We boaſt not of our ſelues, or of any thing that we can doe: but wee boaſt in the Lord. Securus gloriatur qui gloriatur in Domino:

               Heereafter ye ſhall ſee. This heereafter ſeemes to exclude the former world from the benefit that is heere promiſed: as if there had beene no gate of heauen open vntill the death and reſurrection of Chriſt. So the Church of Rome hath imagined; and therefore during this Interim, the Catechiſme publiſhed by Pius Quintus, according to the Decree of the Tridentine Councell, beſtoweth all the ſoules of the faithfull that departed vnder the Old Teſtament, either in Abrahams boſome, where they were diſcharged of all

paines, and yet held from the ſight of God: or elſe in Purgatorie, where they had ſenſible paines, and the lacke of Gods preſence too.

            In the meane time wee will ſearch (if you pleaſe) what allowance the Scripture giueth to fire for purging of ſinnes. The onely place that is alleged with probabilitie,1. Cor. 3. is that which the Apoſtle writeth; The fire ſhall true euery mans worke, of what ſort it is. That ſhewes that there is a probatorie, but prooues not any Purgatorie fire.
            Thorow this fire of probation all maner of workes

and workmen muſt paſſe: and the maſters of Purgatorie (you know) will not allow that any of their ſaints or excellent workmen ſhould bee once cinged. And therefore this fire of triall makes nothing for their Purgatorie.
            The true Purgatorie of Chriſtians is the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, which quencheth euery aduerſary fire, and purgeth vs from all our ſinnes. When the Centurion pierced his ſide, there came out water and blood, to ſhew that it was no common and ordinary blood that came from Ieſus Chriſt, but ſuch as had a cleanſing vertue. O Lord purge vs heerewith, and wee ſhall be cleane: waſh our robes in the blood of this Lambe, and we ſhall be whiter than ſnow. Surely he that is ſo waſhed already, needs not the mathematicall fire of Purgatorie, but is cleane thorowout. And he that is not waſhed with the blood of Chriſt, ſhall neuer be cleanſed, but tormented for euer in real fire. Seeing then that the fire of Purgatorie is to ſome men needleſſe, and to all other helpleſſe, I wiſh better to this ſacred preſence, than to hold you any longer in the ſmoake of that which is fruitleſſe.
            
               Abrahams boſome is a place of more contentment. And who would not bee with the father of the faithfull? But if the Church of Rome will haue it to bee no more than a place diſcharged of ſenſible pains, where they were neuertheleſſe ſuſpended from Gods preſence; I ſee no great matter that can be in it to allure vs. But none can ſpeake better to the quality and condition of Abrahams boſome, than Abraham himſelfe. And he bids the rich glutton remember that hee in his life time receiued pleaſures,Luke 16. and Lazarus likewiſe

paines: now therefore he is comforted, and thou art tormented. In ſuſpenſion there is anxietie, and no comfort, eſpecially when the ſuſpenſion is from the fruition and ſight of God.

And if they had the ſame reward then that Chriſtians haue now; whence comes this difference, that the gate of heauen is open, to vs, and ſhut vpon them? that aſſoone as wee faile, they receiue vs into euerlaſting Tabernacles?Luke 16.

Into bleſſedneſſe inſtantlie? and they of the Old Teſtament are delaied vntill the reſurrection of Chriſt? are, without any warrant at al ſo vncourteouſly ſent to Abrahams boſome, and that vnto Vtopia?
            
            It cannot be for that the worke of Chriſts redemption was not performed at the time of their death: For albeit, that worke was fixed to the fulnes of time: Before, his houre was not come: Then, hee would

not admit of any tergiuerſation. Shall I not drinke of the cup which my father hath giuen me? Yet was the power of that worke, and the vertue of his redemption, extended from the beginning of the world vnto the end thereof. He entred but once to the Sanctuarie of heauen, but hee found eternall redemption. And how can that which is eternall, be limited or reſtrained to future times? Doth it not comprehend all times? Yes verily, and it is a tranſcendent aboue them all. Was not the lambe ſlaine from the beginning of the world? And is it poſſible that a Sacrifice of ſuch price, ſo offred, and ſo accepted, ſhould not bee of preſent efficacie? Prius eius mors profuit quàm fuit:
               Bernard. It ſatisfied God, redeemed man, opened heauen, and put the whole kingdome of Satan into combuſtion preſently.
            So Chriſts Heereafter in this text is no limitation of time, as if heauen had not beene penetrable before his death and reſurrection. But this Hencefoorth implieth the acceſſion that is giuen to out ſight by the miniſterie of the Goſpell. Hencefoorth yee ſhall ſee. That which the Fathers hoped for, that wee doe ſee: and the paſſage vnto heauen is made much more conſpicuous by the light of the New Teſtament. We haue Chriſt borne and ful growen: they had him too, but hidden in the ſeed of Abraham, in the loines of Dauid, in the wombe of a royall Virgin;Eſa. or if a childe were borne vnto them, yet was he wrapped vp in the ſwa

the temple might not bee publiſhed: but at the death of Chriſt this veile was rent, that all within might be viſible and manifeſt. Thorow this veile Iacob did ſee a ladder, that reached vp to heauen: heere is yet obſcuritie enough; the Angels went vp and downe: What is that to vs that be men? What ſhall wee doe with a ladder, when the gates of Heauen bee ſhut againſt vs? when there be Che

If you will bee pleaſed to looke vpon this Heereafter in the New Teſtament, Iacobs veile is rent, that you may ſee all things plaine, heauen open, the Angels aſcending and deſcending vpon the ſonne of man. If they goe vp and downe vpon the ſonne of man, then Chriſt is the ladder that reacheth vp to heauen: he is the way that carrieth vs to that high Country: The Lion of the Tribe of Iuda is our Conuoy, ſtronger than the armed man: our guide hath the key of Dauid, openeth, and no man ſhutteth. I haue enough, ſayes Iacob; Ioſeph my ſonne is yet aliue; I will goe ſee him ore I die. We alſo haue enough, and more than Iacob had: therefore goe maſters, goe, that we may ſee him too.
            
               Chap. 2.The ſpouſe in the Canticles compareth him to a Roe, or a yoong Hart: Behold, he commeth leaping by the mountains, and skipping by the hils: he is the ſonne of God, and thereby higher than the higheſt heauens: that is beyond our reach. For God dwelleth in light that none can come neere to. Therefore becauſe he would be low enough for vs, he became man alſo, and ſtood vpon the ground. Hee tooke nor the

Angels; he came leaping by thoſe mountaines, and skipping by thoſe hils: but hee tooke the ſeed of Abraham, and deſired to be

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , a louer of men rather than a louer of Angels. He profeſſeth it in the 8. of the Proverbs: My delight was to bee amongſt the ſonnes of men. I had thought, O Lord, that thy delight had beene amongſt the Hoſt of Angels: but ſeeing that of thy pittifull clemencie, and admirable be

            Now if you aske me why he tooke our nature, and not the Angels that were fallen as well as wee, Multum eſt à me, abyſſus eſt, profundum Crucis eſt: The Well is deepe, and I haue not any thing to draw withall.

            The ſonne of God appeared to Adam after his fall: and the man ran away, and hid himſelfe in the trees of the garden: Heere was nothing but the terrour of a Iudge, no fleſh taken, no placabilitie of a mediator: Hee appeared many times to the fathers in humane ſhape, to giue them a taſte of his future incarnation: heere was great contentment, if it might haue had continuance: but hee layd downe that ſhape againe. When the fulneſſe of time came, hee combined the godhead and our nature ſo firmly together, with the glue of his perſon, that man could neuer flie from God againe, and God would neuer be ſeuered from man.

So now I will deliuer him vnto you as the ladder that Iacob did ſee: high enough, becauſe he was God; low

enough, becauſe he was man; ſtrong enough to carrie vs to God, becauſe of a Iudge hee is become an aduocate; and of perpetuitie, becauſe the perſonall vnion cannot be diſſolued. Some doubt may bee of his bredth. I am not ſent (he ſaith) but vnto the loſt ſheepe of the houſe of Iſrael.

How farre vnbeſeeming had it beene the greatneſſe of the Father, if the Sonne or Holy Ghoſt had ſent him? Therefore as

the firſt perſon in order, and fountaine of all diuinitie, he did abide in his maieſtie, and ſent the Sonne: And Father and Sonne both ſent the Holy Ghoſt, not to bee incarnate, for ſo there muſt haue beene two Sonnes; one Sonne of God in Heauen, and another Sonne of m

The Spirit doth make interceſſion for vs with ſighs and groan as that cannot be expreſſed. Yet there be two differences that make the mediation of the Sonne of God eminent aboue all the groanes of the Holy Ghoſt: the one for the time, the other for the manner. 1. The Sonne of God maketh interceſſion for vs before the wrath of God bee appeaſed: the groanes of the Holy Ghoſt come after. 2.

In the daies of his fleſh he offred vp praiers, and ſupplications, and himſelfe too, with ſtrong crying, &amp; teares, and was heard becauſe of his reuerence.
            The Holy Ghoſt neuer offred vp any thing; Hee comes only as a Comforter, not as a Redeemer; as a monitor to vs, not as a mediator for vs. He comes to helpe our dulneſſe, to raiſe vs vp, to giue heat to our affect

            Come holy Spirit, and let it bee thy good pleaſure to remember vs in this thy fauourable influence: take away ſtumbling blocks out of my ſoule, which is the kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt, that he may raigne there alone as hee ſhould doe. Couetouſneſſe comes and challengeth gouernment; pride would be a king; luſt ſayes ſhee will raigne; ambition, backbiting, enuie, and wrath, ſtriue in mee which of them ſhould haue the greateſt ſway. I, dull and heauy creature, reſiſt as I am able: I withſtand as farre as I am aided: I claime Ieſus to be my Lord: I defend my ſelfe for him, becauſe I am his right: I hold him for my God, him for my Lord: Come therefore holy Spirit, and ſcatter theſe Vſurpers in thy power: Draw vs all after him; draw vs, though wee be vnwilling, and make vs willing: draw vs that are ſlothfull, and make vs cheerfull. Shed out and powre foorth the oile of thy gladneſſe vpon vs, and we ſhall run in the ſauour of thine ointments: We are ſoone weary, and changeable, draw vs after him, leſt wee begin to take our vagaries after other louers.

Sure, Angels are not ſtrong enough to carrie vs to heauen, and men are too weake: yet there bee Giants now, as were after the flood, that hauing got ſuch morter and bricke, ſay, Come let vs build a tower, whoſe top may reach vp to heauen: Videte quas ſcalas, imo quae praecipitia, ipſi ſibi parauerint ad ruinam: Marke what ladders, yea rather what downfals, they haue gotten themſelues for their owne ruine: for Angels are creatures, not able to ſtand of themſelues, without the ſupport and benefit of the ſonne of God. If their abilitie had beene ſufficient, the diuels would neuer haue loſt their places. The reſt are called elect Angels;1. Tim. 5. Col 2.10. Col. 1. and Chriſt is the ground of all election. Verily Paul calleth him the head of principalities and powers, in whom they doe all conſiſt.

And if I ſhould commit my cauſe to ſuch an aduocate as hath need of a patron himſelfe, it were a right tower of Babel, and no ſcale of heauen. The holieſt men in the world are too weake to carry vs to heauen by their interceſſions. Doth this appertaine vnto man, O Lord God? Adam was perfect both in body and ſoule, yet of too too baſe a condition to ſtand in the preſence of God, without the interuention of a mediator. The tree of life, which was giuen him, is a cleare teſtimony heereof. What needed he any Sacrament of Chriſt, if hee could haue ſtood of himſelfe? And then mee thinkes it is plaine enough, that ſeeing Adam could not mediate

his owne cauſe in his integritie, no ſaint, though in heauen, is able to vndertake for vs in this common miſerie. Mary began to be a mediator for wine at the marriage in Cana: but aſſoone as Chriſt repreſſed her bold

               eſſe, ſhe deſiſted ſoberly, and gaue a wholeſome charge to the waiters, which may well hold the nature of a rule amongſt all poſteritie, to attend vpon Chriſt alone. When the Saints themſelues doe ſend vs vnto Chriſt, ſhall wee leaue him, and in our ſuperſtitious affections hang vpon Saints? If you do, looke for nothing but that which happened vnto Baals Prieſts: They cried from the morning vntill the euening ſacrifice, and there was neither voice, nor one to make anſwer, not any that regarded.
            Tell vs, Paul, what you did thinke when you were in ſuch a ſtrait, that you knew not what to chuſe; whether to be diſſolued and to be with Chriſt, which was better for your owne particular; or to abide in the fleſh, which was more profitable to the Philippians? Were you not then verily perſwaded, that after your death the Church could make no vſe of your praiers? What then? Is the ſaints loue diminiſhed in heauen, where all their graces be increaſed? No ſure, loue fal

               eth not away: But the loue of the ſaints in heauen is not alwaies in action: It is there rather in Maries contemplation, than in Marthaes exerciſe. Or if it be in action, it is like to Peters, when hee had a taſte of it in the transfiguration of Chriſt. The loue of his brethren, was not decaied, but hee was ſo rauiſhed and pleaſed with the ſight of that which was preſent, that he thought of nothing but the fruition thereof. Bonum eſt nobis eſſe hic; It is good being heere. Hee thought

not of his brethren that were abſent: he deſired but three Tabernacles for thoſe that were preſent.
            Can the Saints that be in heauen heare our praiers from earth? Haue they any diſpenſation of vbiquitie? Haue they any indowment of omni

For who will commit his body to ſuch a Phyſician, that knowes no more of the infirmities thereof than he himſelfe doth tell him? Can they open the gates of heauen for vs? Can they conquer death for vs? All this a mediator muſt doe.

If this only were permitted, oughtedſt not thou to haue forborne this one innocent perſon that neuer ſinned? Thou haſt ſhed innocent blood, and art now not an executioner of the Law of God, but a treſpaſſer againſt it. Art thou able to reinfuſe the guiltleſſe blood into thoſe ſacred veines againe, out of which thou haſt preſumptuouſly ſpilt it? Is thy power nothing to edification▪ but al to deſtruction? Know then O thou enemie, that temeritie is not alwaies fortunate: for deſtruction is now come to a perpetuall end. Ne
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   enim lex iuſtior vlla eſt, quàm necis artifices arte perire ſua. Thus you ſee the power of Satan diſſolued by the death of Chriſt, not with force, but in law and iuſtice. And what doe you thinke of the Godhead of Chriſt, that hitherto was a beholder, and no actor; a Iudge, and no party in this buſineſſe? Should not the Iudge of all the world doe right? Or can there be any better iuſtice, any greater right, than to reſtore the innocent, and to puniſh the wrong-doer? Euen ſo he did. The Godhead of Chriſt, which was glued to his bodie with an inſeparable vnion, which was with it in the graue, that it did not ſee corruption▪ that ſame Godhead did breath the breath of life into it againe, and then he was inter mortuos liber, a free man amongſt thoſe that were dead. When he had thus reuiued and reſtored the innocent, then he ſpoiled principalities and powers, ſo much more magnifically, becauſe he purſued them into their owne holds, and triumphed ouer them in their owne Caſtles, of the graue and hell. It fared with them all as it did with the great ſea-beaſt when he had ſwallowed vp Ionas. They had taken ſuch a morſell as they could not hold, but were

faine to be rid of it againe. Then hee tooke the beaſt, euen the great Leuiathan, that crooked ſerpent, and caſt him aliue into a lake of fire burning with brimſtone. Non iam Diabolum vt Leonem timemus, ſed vt pellem concul

                  mus: We doe not now feare the Diuell as a Lion, but wee tread him vnder our feet as a caſe. There is no cauſe now that you ſhould ſtand in doubt of any angrie Porters, that you ſhould bee afraid of any firie ſword. Chriſt ſee Satan falling downe from heauen, as if it had beene lightning.

            When Chriſt was riſen againe, hee made not the earth a place of his reſidence, but aſcended to heauen as a conquerour. It is well ſeene how thou my King and God goeſt to thy ſanctuarie: not climing by ladders, not hoiſed vp by cords or pullies, but marching valiantly in the multitude of thine owne ſtrength; thou makeſt the Clouds thy Chariots, and walkeſt vpon the wings of the winde. And when hee came neere to the wals of that heauenly Citie, hee did not begge or intreat an entrance by fauour, but commanded it as one that had authoritie. Lift vp your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift vp, ye euerlaſting doores, and the King of glory ſhall come in. Securae eſtote caro &amp; ſanguis▪ coelum in capite poſ

Ego alium noui neminem qui hoc potuerit, niſi Dominum meum Ieſum. He ſhall be my mediator; he ſhall be my ladder: If he did redeeme me with the infirmitie of his death, can he not make interceſſion for me in the maieſtie and glorie of his life? He liues at the right hand of God, not in contemplation of his owne greatnes, but for the comfort and ſuſtentation of our wants He liues for euer, to make interpellation for vs: and if he were heard in the dayes of his fleſh, becauſe of his reuerence, ſhall he be refuſed now at the right hand of God, becauſe of his glorie? Hauing once opened heauen, he makes it a thorow fare for our praiers to aſcend, and for his benefits to deſcend. Amongſt other things that he giueth vs from thence, one is here ſpecially mentioned in the text. The Angels of God aſcend and deſcend vpon the ſonne of man: that is, by his appointment and authoritie, to attend, to guard, to comfort vs poore men.Heb. 10. Are they not all miniſtring ſpirits, ſent foorth for their ſakes that ſhall bee heires of ſaluation?Pſal. 34. The Angell of the Lord pitcheth round about the Tents of the godly, and deliuereth them. They ſhall beare our ſoules into Abrahams boſome.Luke 16. Let vs vſe their miniſtry, that is glorious; leaue their mediation, that is ſuperfluous.
            There is another ſort of Angels that aſcend and deſcend vpon the ſonne of man. When he led captiuitie

captiue, he gaue gifts vnto men, ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Paſtors and Doctors, for the gathering together of the Saints. Theſe are called in the Reuelation, the Angels of the Churches, and heere they are ſaid to goe vp and downe. They had not need to ſit ſtill, leſt the children ſhould call for bread, and there no none to breake it vnto them. We haue the keies of the kingdome of heauen committed vnto vs.Matt. 16.

This power Peter and Paul did exerciſe faithfully: They preached the Goſpell, and in that, remiſſion of ſinnes, and ſo opened the kingdome to the beleeuers. They neuer practiſed nor thought of ſuch exorbitant and infinite power, as the Church of Rome doth now vſurpe vnder the colour and title of thoſe keies, directly or indirectly to ſway and to diſpoſe of all the world. Paul neuer planted any ſuch power, Apollos neuer watered it, and God of his great mercy, neuer giue increaſe to it in theſe kingdomes. It is clauis errans, a falſe and counterfeit key: the kingdome of heauen is not opened, but ſhut with ſuch keies. It is the key of the bottomleſſe pit.

Who hath made me a Iudge amongſt you? He diſclaimeth all authoritie

in ſecular affaires, and profeſſeth that his kingdome is not of this world: Regnum meum non eſt de hoc mundo. Hee did not ſpeake it in a corner, but before Pontius Pilate in the iudgement place, where the Apoſtle ſaies he made a good confeſſion. And thoſe things that bee done in iudgement, are ſo publike, that they are intended to be done before all the world. Therefore Auguſtine makes Chriſt call all the world to record: Aud

            Compare them now together, and you ſhall ſee how the Vicars of Chriſt agree with their founder: Chriſt had no kingdome in the world, and they will haue all the kingdomes of the earth: Chriſt would haue no authoritie to diuide inheritances, and they will haue none to doe it but themſelues: Chriſt did not trouble any humane gouernment, and they will not ſuffer any to be quiet.

            I haue deliuered you Chriſt Ieſus, to be a ladder to carry you to heauen: and now nothing remaineth, but to ſhew the vſe of it, which I will do in a word or two, becauſe I dare not abuſe your patience longer. You ſhall therfore paſſe vpon him along from ſtep to ſtep, vntill you come to the throane of grace. The firſt ſtep you ſhall begin at his natiuitie, wherein, the leſſe that he made himſelfe in his humanitie, the greater he offred himſelfe vnto you in his bounty: and the baſer that he was for you, the dearer hee ſhould be to you.

The next ſtep that you make, is to his life, and that is broad with innocencie. Innocent in his conception, becauſe it was of the Holy Ghoſt;

Innocent in the reſt of his life,Philip. 2. for hee was obedient to the father, &amp;c. Innocent in his affections, becauſe they were tempered to the pleaſure of God;Mat. 26. Not my will, but thy will be done. Innocent in his words; Si malo locutus fuero, de malo fe
