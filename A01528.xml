            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL Mr. ROBERT OFFLY MASTER of the company of Habberdashers, and the right Worshipfull Sir IOHN GARRET Knight, Mr. Alderman HAMMERSLY, Mr. Alderman WHITMORE, Mr. Alderman RANTON, and other worthy fathers and brethren of the said Company, all prosperitie in this world, and happinesse in the world to come.
            
               Right Worshipfull,
            
            
               ALbeit the expressions of a gracious heart by liuely voice breed deeper impressions, (God attending his own ordinance of preaching with a more speciall blessising) yet writing hath in this respect a prerogatiue, that holy truths thus conueyed to the world spread further, and continue longer.

Those therefore deserue well of the Church that this way impart those things to publike and future vse, by which God wrought on the hearts of the hearers for the present. In which respect this funerall Sermon preached out of loue and honour of the graces of God in a poore, yet well esteemed Christian (Master WINTER) may gaine acceptan
                  ••
               , as being not onely for matter sound, for handling cleere, but for the times seasonable. For what more necessarie in these times, wherein many are ashamed of the downeright profession of that religion by which they hope to be saued, than to presse constant faithfulnesse in known truths, vnto which all promises are intailed? Particular points haue beene much and long vrged amongst vs, it is very needfull that constant clea
                  •
               ing to all those blessed truths likewise be inforced. And from what stronger incouragement can this be, than from a crown of life here promised to the crowne of all graces, Perseuerance? Since the fall, one dangerous disease of the soule, is vnsetlednesse in good purposes, especially when either discouragements or alluremēts are offered. But

what wil not a soule break thorow, that hath in the eie of it a crowne held out to all that hold out to the end▪ by him who hath both obtained it for vs, and keepeth it for vs, and vs for it? There is a mutuall passage of trust between God and vs (for thus graciously he condescendeth to vs.) We trust him with the saluation of our soules, he trusteth vs with his truth, which if by grace we be inabled to keepe, it will keepe vs▪ and raise vp our hearts to an expectation of all good frō our faithfull and good God, euen at that time when our soules gaspe for comfort, at the houre of death. And at the day of iudgement the sentence will passe, not according to greatnesse of parts and place, but according to faithfulnesse, Well done, not learned, wise, rich, but faithfull seruant, &amp;c. This Sermon intreating of things thus vsefull, is presented by me, as intreated by the widow of the late deceased (Master WINTER) and some others whom I respect, and to you as chiefe of that Company whereof he was a poore member: and this by willing consent of the author, my reuerend &amp; ancient friend of whom I am not willing to take this occasion to speake: his long, faithfull, learned labours

in the Church haue made him sufficiently knowne. He gaue her full power of the copy for her vse. Which in her behalfe, and at her desire, I offer vnto your worships as a testimony of her respect, as likewise if there be a blessing in your hands in the behalfe of the Orphans of such as haue beene of your Company, I was not vnwilling to take this aduantage of presenting her estate to your mercifull considerations, considering she traineth vp a sonne at the Vniuersitie for the future seruice of the Church. It is a speciall blessing of God where he hath giuen power and a willing mind to do good, to offer likewise the opportunity of fit obiects that bounty be not misplaced; which here vndoubtedly you shall haue, and the blessing of the fatherlesse and widow shall come vpon you. The Lord leade you on in a course of faithfulnes to which we are here encouraged, that in the end you may receiue the crowne of life which is here promised.

                  . 
               Faith is taken sometime for credulitie,

                and sometime for fidelitie; sometime for trust, and sometime for trustinesse; sometime for confidence in another, and sometime for faithfulnesse to another: In the former sense it is taken in those phraeses so vsuall; 
                  Act. 24.25. 
               Faith in Christ, and 
                  Act. 3.16. 
               Faith in his Name:
               
                  Fidelitie. Faithfulnesse.
                In the latter sense it is taken in those words of our Sauiour, 
                  Matth. 23.23. 
               You neglect iudgement, mercy, and faith, or fidelitie; and in those of the Apostle, 
                  Tit. 2.10. 
               Let seruants shew all faith (that is,
                  
                     Faithfull two waies.

               faithfull in a twofold respect: sometime in regard of their faith; that is, their beliefe and confidence in Christ: 
               
                  Iohn 20.27. 
               Be not faithlesse, but faithfull; saith our Sauiour to

               Thomas: And, 2 Cor. 6.15. 
               What part hath the faithfull with the Infidell?
               
                  In regard of Fidelitie and Faithfulnesse.
                saith the Apostle; that is, the beleeuer with the vnbeleeuing. Sometime in regard of their fidelitie and faithfulnesse vnto Christ: 
               
                  Matth. 24.45. 
               Who is a wise and a faithfull seruant? saith our Sauiour. And, 1 Cor. 7.27.

               Fidelitie or faithfulnesse is required of all Christians.
            
            
               Faith in Christ must be seconded with faithfulnesse vnto Christ. As we must haue Faith in him, so we must keepe Faith to him. For 
                  Apoc. 14.17. those that are with him, are
