            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            To the high, Noble, and
moſt Illuſtrious:
CHARLES,
Prince of Wales, &amp;c.
            
               SIr, let the ſtrength
of my deſires to ſerve
you, obtaine your pardon,
for this my triviall dedication.
Yet if the title of this
booke bee true, (which is not
mine, but the firſt authors) it
may prove worthy your inſpection;
if not, your peruſall. For,
the few rules therein conteyned,
(if he may be credited)
being well obſerved, will gaine

you the love of all men; and
(conſequently) command
their obedience. Two things,
which Princes, above others,
have greatest neede of, and
wherein they become moſt happy,
being made thereby, more
abſolute, then either by rigor
of Lawes, or force of Armes.
It is (I confeſſe) moſt true,
that the great deedes, and heroick
actions of Princes, are
of higheſt eſteeme: yet are they
not (therefore) to bee altogether
regardleſſe, even of their
ordinary behaviour, and uſuall
cariage. For as by them, they
become moſt powerfull, and
renouned: ſo by theſe, (if
pleaſing, and gracefull) they

grow more endeered, in the
peopls affections. This treatiſe
was firſt penned by a Courtyer.
Therefore if it bee not well
tranſlated, no marvaile, for
how ſhould a plodding Lawyer,
make a neate conſtruction, of a
quaint and polite Gallants
meaning? rude as it is, I hope
your highneſſe will be pleaſed
to accept of it, not caſting
your eye ſo much upon the
courſe viſage, of the preſent,
as upon the faire intentions
of the preſenter. I confeſſe
there be no dainties in it, fit
for your curious palate, yet
(I beſeech you) bee pleaſed
to taſt of it, that others, for
whom ſuch courſe fare is farre

more proper, may thereby
bee brought, to reliſh it
the better. All I will ſay
in its commendation, is this:
it is but briefe, and is full
of variety.

illuſtrious, and reverend Lord,
Don Iuan dymas Loris, Biſhop of

nothing in it, which contradicts,
the faith, but is very profitable,
and helpful to the good inſtruction,
and education of youth.
            Dated in this monaſtery of S.

            The Approbation.
            I Peter Torrens, Doctr of Divinity,
by the commiſſion of
the Illuſtrious, and right reverend
Lord, Gabriel Marquet,
officiall, and vicar generall of
Tarraconenſis, have read this
booke, intituled the Galateo
Eſpanoll, and I have found nothing
in it, repugnant to the
Catholique faith, and unto
good manners. In witneſſe wherof,
I here ſubſcribe my ſelfe,
            
               P. Torrens.

The right illuſtrious Lord,
Micer Franciſco Bonnet, Viceroy
of Catalunna, and
Counſellour of
Barcelona.
            
               RIght reverend Sir,
being of opinion, that
the ſubject of this
booke, intituled the
Galateo Eſpanol,
is of great importance, and of much
furtherance, to know how, and in
what manner, men ought (ordinarily)
to carry themſelves, ſo that
they be not only not ill thought of,
and hated of others, But very acceptable,
and pleaſing to all: and
conſidering on the other ſide, that
for want of Copies thereof, the
common wealth looſeth this ſo great
a good. I determined to print it

at my owne charge. Becauſe that it
is not now in my power, or ability,
to doe things of greater importance,
I have (at leaſt) done what
I could in this little: and as much
as my skill would reach unto. Afterward
taking it into my conſideration
unto whom I were beſt to
dedicate it, as the cuſtome is to
doe, in the like impreſſions of
bookes; my phanſy then gave me, that
I could not better dedicate it, to any
body then your honour, who with
greater zeale and thought, deſireth,
&amp; procureth, the good of this ſame
common wealth then any other, (as
all doe well ſee, &amp; confeſſe) as well
in the charge of a Counſellour, as in
that of a deputy, which your honour
houlds, at the preſent, and doth
order, and governe there in with
ſo great diligence. Therefore I truſt,
that your honour will bee pleaſed,
to receive it under your protection:
and although the ſervice bee not
ſuch, as is fit for the perſon of your

Honour, yet receive the heart and
good will, with which it is offered,
together with the deſire I
have, to ſerve your Honour, and the
common wealth, (dayly) more and
more, in matters of greater conſequence:
for by this favour, and
reward, I recover more heart, and
vigour, to undertake, and finiſh
a greater worke. God keepe your
Lordſhip.
            
               Right illuſtrious Sir,

Honours hands.
            
         
         
            
            To
The right illuſtrious
Lord, Goncales Argeto de
Molina, Provinciall, and grand
Iuſticiar, for his Majeſty, for the
holy brotherhood, of Andaluſia:
Lord of the Townes, of Veros,
and Dagancuelo: and of the
Caſtle of Gildolid. Alderman
of Civill,
&amp;c.
            
               THe great and particular
friendſhip,
which Antonio Gratian,
my brother,
that is in Heaven,
Counſellour of his Majeſty, and
Secretary to his royall perſon,
did finde with your Honour,
obliges mee, to acknowledge

it, and to accompt of it, as all
the good wits of this age doe:
behoulding in your Honour,
thoſe teſtimonies, which you
have afforded us in Armes, Government,
and writings, of his
much vertue, great courage and
cleare underſtanding. For having
at thirteene yeares old,
begun to ſerve his Majeſty in
the Warrs, and not forgetting
the exerciſe of learning, as we
may perceive by the pledges,
which Spaine enjoyes, and expects
from your Honours wiſdome,
in the governing of the
holy brother-hood, of Andaluzia:
which your Honour takes
charge of: he hath ſhewed his
worth, ſo that in one yeere
wherein he ſerved, by condemning
a great number to death
and the Gallies, he hath ſecured
this Province, which was ſo
waſted with robbers; And I am
confident the Divine, and humane

Majeſty, will grant your
Honour, the reward which
ſuch workes deſerve, which my
Galateo did rightly conſider, in
beſeeching of your Honour, to
accept of it, with the ſame affection,
it is offered. Our Lord
preſerve the right renouned
perſon, of your Honour, many
dayes, with as much increaſe
of wealth as is poſſible. From
Madrid the 10. of Ianuary, 1582.

Honourable hands.
            
         
         
            
            To the Reader.
            
               HAving ſeene (by experience)
in the paſſage
of my life, all
the rules of this book,
I was of opinion, that
I ſhould doe more good, if I did
tranſlate, out of the Italian Galateo,
theſe things, which ought to
be conſidered of, in the time of
our youth, and to adde other
ſtories, and things, tending to
this purpoſe, which I have ſeene,
and heard: which might be inſteed
of dainties, and ſweete language,
to make us paſſable, without an
ill ſavour: the guilded Pills of a
loving reprehenſion, which are

conteyned in this booke, though
they bee cloathed in Tales, and
jeſtes, doe not ceaſe to profit any
that ſtands in neede of theſe admonitions:
if his mouth bee not
ſo bitter, and his taſt ſo diſtempered,
that nothing can pleaſe him;
but for others, that are not ſuch,
as are deciphered, in this Table,
they may taſt much of their owne
neatneſſe, and good judgement, and
if any tittle of this, concerne them,
they may bee admoniſhed thereby,
and amend their fault, without any
trouble of any, with the bare reading,
and obſervation of this treatiſe.
I know well, that ſome will
ſay, that I have ill acquitted my
ſelfe, by theſe inſtructions, though
I make my ſelfe maſter of them: but
I anſwer with the ſame Galateo,
where he ſayth, that the rather, as
one that takes warning from faltring
in them, doe I now ſet them
forth, that others may not fall ſo
unadviſedly as I have done, and

ſo I am excuſed; Alleadging for
my principall diſcharge to admoniſh
thereby, to a matter ſo proper
for me, and at ſuch a time as it
cannot be taken for a reproofe, but
an admonition. For that when I
come of diſcretion, I conſider I ſhall
receive content, in that I have bin
admoniſhed; for although I have
procured others to to live reſpected
of all, yet might I have bin more
wary of my ſelfe. This I offer to the
curious Reader, but my intention
is to ſerve him, ſubjecting my
ſelfe, to receive with love, what reproofe
he can give me.

            THE AUTHOR
directeth this work,
to one of his Brothers: adviſing
him what hee ought to
doe, and what he ought to ſhun, in
his ordinary carriage, to be
well eſteemed, and beloved
of the People.
            
               SEing it is certaine, that
thou art to begin that
Journey which (for
the moſt part of my
youth) I waſted, in
this mortall life: for
the love I beare thee, I determined
with my ſelfe, to ſhew thee
the ſteps, in which I walked, and
am experienced in: that when thou
paſſeſt in them, thou mayeſt know
how to leave that, which is ill, and

to chooſe the good in the right way
of thy ſalvation. And becauſe thy
tender age is not ſufficient, nor apt to
receive theſe rules and counſells,
(reſerving them for their time) I may
perchance begin to treate of thoſe,
which ſome may thinke to be of little
moment; And this is that, which
I am of opinion muſt bee performed:
ſo that in converſing and dealing with
the People thou mayeſt get a good
habit and obſerve an affable, and
acceptable demeanour, and cariage:
which is no leſſe then virtue it ſelfe,
or very like her: as it is to be liberall,
conſtant, or magnanimous, ſo is it to
know the manner, and way how to
governe thy ſelfe, in thy words and
behaviour. And this pleaſing behaviour,
is of force to ſtirre up and
gaine in thy prayſe, and eſteeme, the
affection and good will of thoſe
with whom thou muſt converſe, and
live with all. And on the contrary:
thou muſt avoyde a rude, and careleſſe
cariage: which may procure
thee hatred ill will and diſpraiſe.
And grant there be no puniſhment by
Law, for them that are harſh, and
clowniſh, in their converſation, (becauſe

the fault is not accompted
haynous) yet it is enough, they are
puniſhed by making themſelves ill eſteemed,
of all People: ſo that, (in
truth) as men are affraid of fierce,
wild Beaſts, But make no accompt
of ſome little Creatures, as Waſpes and
Flyes, which they feare not, yet for
the continuall trouble and vexation,
which they receive by them, they
oftner complaine of them, then of
the other great ones. And ſo it happens,
that moſt men complaine as ill,
of theſe troubleſome men, by reaſon
of their careleſſe cariage, as upon
thoſe that are full of miſchiefe, and
naughtineſſe. And therefore none can
doubt: but that he that frames himſelfe
to live, be it not in hermitages:
or other ſolitary places; But in Cities
and Courts amongſt much People,
to him I ſay it is a very profitable
thing, to know how to bee pleaſing,
and acceptable in his manners: and
that he ſo temper his behaviour, and
dealings, that they content not ſo
much his owne will, and liking as
they be acceptable, and pleaſing, to
them with whom we converſe withall.
I know well, that in thy firſt

age, thou muſt paſſe through the beaten
path of infancy, paſſing it over
in ſimplicity, and childiſh exerciſes,
yet Seneca, that was ſo wiſe (as he
was frō his youth) paſſed not them ſo
over, but they report of him, that two
Romane Embaſſadors, who held him
wiſe went to Cordova of whence they
ſay he was, to ſee him, and as they
ſaw him playing at Cheſſe with other
youthes of the ſame age, they
wondred much how (being ſo wiſe)
he could do ſo and not believing it
was he, they went unto him, and
asked him; what doſt thou young
man? Seneca lifted up his head and
anſwered them acutely, I am heere
beſtowing upon Time, that which is
its own. They ſtood aſtoniſhed, looking
each upon the other and durſt
queſtion him no further. Let every
age therefore obſerve his owne puntillioes;
According to this rule ſhould
I doe ill, to draw thee from thy courſe:
indeed I am of a contrary opinion
from it: for it becomes not well a
young man to be like an old man, and
no leſſe for an old man, to behave
himſelfe like a young man: but that
in every age a man yield, and obſerve

what is due to it. But let this reliſh
well to thee, that from the time that
thou beginneſt to make uſe of thy
reaſon, and to enter into the ſtate of
youth, thou obſerve, and reade theſe
things, that ſo thou be not lothſome,
but mayſt underſtand, to give content;
And this muſt be done moderately,
for he that takes pleaſure to
doe things one upon the neck of another,
to pleaſe him that obſerves
his doings, may bee accompted a
Jugler, or perchance a flatterer, rather
then a modeſt Gentleman: as
he that takes no care, either to pleaſe,
or diſpleaſe him that heares him, may
bee rightly called a Clowne. Firſt
thou muſt marke what belongs to thy
office thou art in, before thou come to
quaintneſſe.
            Preſuppoſe therefore that firſt before
all other things men muſt take
heede of the office, charge, and place
wherein they are, &amp; whence they have
their lively-hood, and to know well
how to mannage an eſtate, for in this a
man is much eſteemed. For without
this, there is none that will accompt
of theſe rules and inſtructions. Now
to be well eſteemed and loved of men

I will begin in giving thee this adviſe
from what befell a diſcreete Citizen,
who treating of a marriage for
one of his Daughters, who was accounted
rich and faire, firſt of all
they informed him that the man propoſed
to him was a gentleman of good
parts, ſpiritefull, gratious, diſcreete,
and very well eſteemed of, and finally
ſuch a one as I intend to decipher in
this treatiſe, who (after he had attentively
liſtened unto all his good qualities)
ſayd unto them, my Lords all
this is very good: and it will be as
neceſſary for him to Dine and Sup
after this alſo, but you tell me not in
what office hee lives and gaines his
living: what profit can be made of his
perſon, or what neede can we have of
it only? and ſo they were at a ſtand,
with all the virtues and good parts
they had reckoned up. And ſo now
at length under this ſuppoſition, in
that which concerneth policy, I ſay
that our manner of converſation, is
more pleaſing in taking heede how
others reliſh us, then in our owne proper
conceipt &amp; eſteeme of our ſelves.
            
               
1. What things we muſt ſhun.
            And if we deſire to finde out what
thoſe things be, which doe generally
pleaſe moſt men; and what thoſe
which offend them, we may eaſily find
in this treatiſe, what things we muſt
avoyd in our converſation, and what
things we are to make choyce of, we
ſay now, that every act, which is
troubleſome, or offenſive to any of the
ſences, namely that doth diſtaſt us
and offer it ſelfe in any ill manner to
the phanſy &amp; things that are beaſtly,
and loathſome, ought not only not
be done of us in the preſence of the
People▪ but alſo not to be named, nor
called to minde, by any motion or outward
exerciſe.
            2. Ill properties which are accuſtomed
to be done for want of taking
heede.
            From whence we may take notice,
that it is an ill quality of thoſe,
that whilſt they are talking with you,
doe ſo gaze and fix their eyes on your
face, as if they were to view ſome

ſtrange thing, and I have ſeene ſome
who whilſt they are talking with one,
they cling ſo cloſe unto him, that
they breath in his face; and it is certain
all doe loath to be breathed upon, by
others, though they find noe ill ſavour
come from them: what will it
be then, if ſuch a man that doth ſo
have a ſtinking breath, or ſputters as
he ſpeakes, as ſome doe? and ſo doth
ſputter upon all that ſtand about him?
I ſay, this is a ſufficient cauſe, to make
a man abhorred. And I have ſeene
ſome ſo puffe and blow ſo vehemently
in relating a diſcourſe, that they alwayes
driveled before they could ſpeak
any thing.
            3. In like manner it is ill for any
to hide his hands under his Coate or
Cloake, in the preſence of any, that
thou art not well acquainted withall;
but thou muſt be carefull, to let them
be uncovered, eſpecially amongſt perſons
of quality.
            4. As unſeemely a thing is it, that
walking with others, in the ſtreete,
(as it is a uſuall thing to doe) and
ſeeing any deade Dog, or any loathſome
thing, that thou ſhouldeſt turne
to thy companion, and ſhew it him,

asking him, whether hee ſaw (as he
paſſed by) that Dog, but that he
take heede he be not the firſt occaſion
that thoſe that walke with him doe
either ſee, or receive a loathing from
it.
            5. This is alſo an ill cuſtome, when
(by reaſon of thy full feeding, or
couldneſſe of ſtomack, thou haſt a
provocation to raſp wind) for thee
to doe it ſo careleſſely, and with ſuch
a noiſe, that all muſt take notice of
it: but it ought to be done ſo privately
that it may not be perceived, and
ſome are ſo civill, that when they
yawne or raſpe winde, they ſmooth
their hand over their faces, as if they
were ſmoothing their beardes, and
at the ſame time, doe cover their
mouthes, ſo that you cannot perceive
them. He did cleane contrary to this,
who raſped wind with a great noiſe,
and ſaid it was all for his health, becauſe
it was the evacuation of the
Ayre, and the coldnes of his body, &amp;
thus commending himſelfe in this
manner as being for his health, one
of the company anſwered him, Sir
your worſhip may live in health, and
yet may continue to bee a Swine.
            
               
6. It alſo is plaine, that it is very
ill, to be careleſſe concerning thy
noſtrils, for there be ſome that breath
very loud through them, and at times
wipe them with their hands and then
rub one hand againſt the other, at
other times they thruſt their fingers
into their noſtrils, and make Pellets
of that they picke out, even before
every body, that is preſent: as in like
manner, ſome are wont to make cakes
of the waxe, which they picke out of
their eyes, and into this careleſeneſſe
and ſlovenlineſſe we have obſerved
many to fall. And much leſſe ought
any to uſe to take any thing in his
hand, that ſmels ill, or may give a
loathing, and to put it to anothers
Noſe, that hee may ſmell how it
ſtinkes: ſaying to him, as you love
your life, doe but try how ill this
ſmelleth; but thou oughteſt rather to
endeavour he may not ſee it.
            7. Now even as all theſe, and many
other things of this ſort, doe offend
the ſence of ſmelling and of taſting,
together with the ſence of ſeeing, ſo
the gnaſhing of the teeth, and the
grinding of hard ſtones, one againſt
another, and ſcouring of Iron, doe

offend the eares, and ſet the teeth on
edge, and a man ought as much as
may be to take heede of them.
            8. A man of quality muſt alſo take
heede he ſing not (eſpecially alone)
if he have not a good and a tunable
voyce, of which thing few take any
heede, but it ſeemes, that (naturally)
thoſe that have the worſt voyces, are
leaſt carefull of this, and are wont
to commend ſuch men that ſing much
though very ill, theſe are like thoſe
that make ſuch a noyſe in coughing
and ſneeſing, that they offend all that
are preſent.
            9. Others there be that ſpit aloft
in the Ayre, who by undiſcreetly
behaving themſelves in ſuch actions,
doe ſprinkell the faces of thoſe that
ſtand about them, and we may finde
in like ſort ſome of them, who in
yawning make a great noyſe like the
noyſe of a beaſt, for that with their
mouthes wide open, they utter this
voyce, or to ſpeake more properly
make a noyſe like a dumbe man in the
middeſt of their ſpeech or diſcourſe,
if they be talking of any thing, ſo
that they cannot be underſtood, but
are an offence to all that heare them.

But a well behaved man muſt avoyd
much yawning, as much as he can,
(and by conſequence of the things
before mentioned) becauſe he that ſo
yawnes ſeemes to bee diſcontented,
and to wiſh himſelfe elſe where out
of that company, and that the diſcourſe
and manner of it doth not like
him; And though it be true that you
thinke it is not in any ones power to
leave yawning; yet notwithſtanding
all this, if the thought be buſy upon
any thing, be it in matter of delight,
or otherwiſe, we never yawne
becauſe we never mind it, but if it
be idle then it thinkes on it, and thus
it comes to paſſe, (as we have ſeene
it often fall out) that when any one
yawnes in the preſence of thoſe that
be idle, all of them will preſently
yawne, and there is as it were a certaine
agreement in gaping, which
appeares like a paſtime amongſt
fooles which might have bin avoided,
if one of them had not called it to
minde: and to conclude, for one to
yawne is as much as to ſay, he is tranſported,
or without memory: it is requiſite
then for any one to ſhun this
cuſtome that is ſo unpleaſing to the

ſight and to the hearing of others:
for in uſing it, it is a token, that we
are of a ſleepy and ſluggiſh diſpoſition,
which may make us to bee ill
beloved of thoſe with whom we converſe.
            10. In like manner there is another
ill cuſtome to be taken notice of, in
ſome that doe blow their Noſes, very
hard, and doe in the preſence of all,
make a pawſe, to looke into their
hankerchiefs, upon that they have
blowed out, as if that which were
there were Pearles, or Dyamonds
that come out of their braynes.
            11. It is alſo an ill cuſtome, for
any to put his Noſe in the Platter, or
bowle of Wine, or over the Meate
which another is to eate, in taking
occaſion to ſmell unto it, or to looke
upon it, to give his opinion, and I
approve not that he taſt more of it,
then he is himſelfe only to drinke,
or eate: for ſomthing may fall from
his Noſe, which may cauſe a loathing
to another, although nothing (in
truth) doe fall. And to phanſy a
thing though it be not ſo, is a great
matter: much leſſe oughteſt thou to
give another drinke in the ſame Cup,

wherein thou haſt drunke thy ſelfe,
except he be thy very familiar or thy
ſervant, nor to give any a Peare or
an Apple, of which thou haſt bitten,
For in not taking good heed of theſe
things (though they ſeeme to be very
triuiall) they become reproachfull,
even like little ſtroakes or wounds,
which if they be often given or repeated,
may at laſt cauſe death unto
thee.
            12. I can now tell you of a thing to
this purpoſe which happened in
Verona a City in Italy, where was a
very wiſe Biſhop, as well for his learning,
as policy, who was called Don
Juan Matheo Gilbert, who amongſt
other his laudable cuſtomes, was very
curteous, and bountifull, doing honour
to Gentlemen travellers, by entertayning
of them, with ſuch proviſion
as was fitting for his quality,
and ſo it fortuned that a noble
Knight, called Count Richardo paſſing
by that way, aboad a few dayes
with the Biſhop, and his family, who
were all of them, curious, neate and
of excellent behaviour, and becauſe
they found the count, both in his
behaviour, and his diſcourſe to be a

diſcreete Gentleman and a moſt noble
Courtyer, they did much value and
eſteeme him, only they found a ſmall
defect in his behaviour, (which the
Biſhop and his ſervants had preſently
eſpied.) And ſo he conſulted carefully
with them, how they might tell
and give him notice of it in ſuch a
way, that he might take no diſtaſt at
them, ſo the count being to depart
the next day, when he had taken his
leave, and giving the Biſhop thankes
for his curteſy afforded him, The
Biſhop call'd to him a diſcreete ſervant
of his, named Galateo, (of whom
this booke tooke its name,) and bad
him take horſe and accompany the
Count on his way, and that when
hee was on the way with him and
ſaw his opportunity that he ſhould
in very ſmooth language tell him of
the defect he had, the ſervant took the
buſineſſe upon him, and as he accompanied
him, being now ready to take
his leave of him, with a very cheerefull
countenance did thus beſpeake
him, my Lord, the Biſhop my maſter,
commanded me, on his behalfe, to
thanke your Lordſhip, for your thankfulneſſe,
which you ſhewed him, for

endevouring to doe you ſervice at
your being at his houſe, and in recompence
of this your curteſy, commanded
mee to make you a preſent
(and I humbly beſeech you it may
be acceptable to you.) The preſent
is this, my Lord you are the moſt
diſcreete, gallant, and moſt ſweete
conditioned cavaleere I ever ſaw or
converſed with, ſo that having ſeriouſly
obſerved your excellent manner
of behaviour, I found nothing
in you that is not exceeding worthy
of commendation, but only one thing,
namely an untunable ſmack which
you uſe with your lipps, &amp; mouth in
eating your meate, which is very offenſive,
and I am ſent to beſeech you
to receive this friendly reproofe and
admonition from him, inſtead of a
preſent, and I aſſure you there is none
other in the World but hee that can
preſent you with ſo good a preſent as
this. The Count that never obſerved
this defect in himſelfe till now,
and remembring how he had commended
him, hearing him reprove
him thus, bluſhed a little, yet like a
brave man, recovering his courage,

                  〈…〉
                the Biſhop, that

if all mens preſents that they make
one to the other were like his, they
would bee farre richer then they are,
and give him (from mee) infinite
thankes, for his ſo great curteſy and
bounty ſhewed me, aſſuring him, that
from henceforth I will take heede to
avoyd this my blemiſh, and ſo he took
his leave of him.
            13. Now then what ſhall we thinke
that the Biſhop would have ſayd, and
his noble family, to thoſe that
we ſee having the Hicket in their eating,
ſit fixt at the Table, never looking
up, or moving their eyes, much
leſſe their hands from off the meate,
with both their cheekes ſtuffed like a
trumpetters, or as if they were blowing
the fire: ſurely this is gluttony
and not eating, who beſmearing
their hands even up to the wriſts, make
their napkins in ſuch a pickle, that
had they wiped their trenchers with
them, they could not bee more foule,
and are not aſhamed oftentimes to
wipe off their ſweat with them,
which with greedineſſe of eating runs
downe their foreheads and faces, and
round their necks, and after this, doe
alſo wipe their Noſes: theſe ſurely

doe not merit not only not to be receaved,
into this Biſhops neate houſe
which we have ſpoken of, but even
ought to bee expelled all civill mens
company. That there may be no ſwiniſhneſſe
committed in our eating.
            14. Thou ſhalt not make thy ſelfe
lothſome at meates and feſtivalls, as
ſome doe, who accompt it a vertue to
doe unbeſeeming things, in tumbling
up and down the Meate, and Drinke,
meaſuring others ſtomacks by their
owne, for which (although others
laugh, and like it well enough) they
cauſe themſelves to bee accuſed of
ſlovenlineſſe and clowniſhneſſe, and
amongſt civill and neate People, it
ſhewes ill. And the curious waiters
and ſervants, that are buſy in attendance
of the Table, may not by
any meanes ſcratch their heades nor
any part of their bodies, before their
maſters, eſpecially at time of meales,
nor cover their hands in their boſoms
pockets or elſe where, but they muſt
bee uncovered: and ſo cleane, that
they ſhew not the leaſt token of ſlovenlineſſe.
This they that wait
muſt take heede of. And thoſe that
attend the Trenchers or Cups to

drinke in, muſt at that time forbeare
to ſpit, or cough, and much more to
ſneeſe, for ſuch actions are as bad, and
the ſuſpition of them doth as much
offend their maſters, as if it were very
true, they had thereby committed
ſome incivility.
            16. And if thou have layd Peares
or Apples to roaſt or bread to toaſt upon
the Coales, thou muſt not blow
the aſhes off, that ſhall bee upon them,
for it is a ſaying, that there can bee
no winde, without water, but thou
muſt either ſhake it (lightly) over
the Trencher, or by ſome other ſuch
like way, to get off the aſhes. The like
fals out to them, that to clenſe away
any little ſtraw, or other thing, blow
in the Wine, their friends are to drink,
and it is an uſuall thing, with ſome
too ſtand blowing of a thing that is
too hot, to allay the heate, but if it be
not a mans wife, (or ſome body elſe
that we cannot take any diſlike for doing
it) it is a raſh part.
            17. Thou mayſt not offer any one
thy Handkercher, for him to wipe
withall (let it be never ſo cleane waſhed,
becauſe hee thou offereſt it unto,
knowes not ſo much, and it may procure
a diſlike in him.
            
               
18. Wee muſt ſhun all ill cuſtomes,
and qualities, and any other that
beare but a reſemblance of thē, wherby
wee may at all offend the ſences of
thoſe we converſe withall, as I have
before ſayd.
         
         
            CHAPTER. 2. Of other things, contrary to the phanſy
and good liking.
            NOw wee will mention ſuch
things, which without offence
of any ſence, doe give diſtaſt to moſt
men, in whoſe preſence we uſe them.
Firſt you muſt know, that men naturally
deſire and have an inclination
to divers things, ſo that ſome ſeeke
to ſatisfie their anger, ſome their belly,
ſome their ſenſes, ſome their covetouſneſſe,
and finally, ſome to ſatisfy
one, ſome another paſſion, and deſire:
to correct which there are many remedies
in our holy Religion, and
every one putting his hand into his
owne boſome, ſhall perceive which
of thoſe deſires is moſt powerfull,
that ſo hee may there make the greateſt

reſiſtance againſt that, that
doth aſſault him with the greateſt
fury.
            1. It ſeemes now, that men cove
that which may afford unto them the
act of communication, and to converſe
one with another; and this may
be, love, honour, and recreation, or
any thing that hath affinity with
theſe: ſo that we ought not to ſpeake,
nor doe any thing, in which wee may
give a token, to another, that we doe
little love or eſteeme him.
            2. And therefore it is a very unſeemely
cuſtome, that many uſe. Namely
to ſleepe where a civill ſociety and
company are talking of any thing; by
careleſſe doing of this, they ſeeme
to diſparage the company, and ſet
light by ſuch diſcourſe. It is farther
to bee conſidered, that hee that is a
ſleepe, is ſo farre from care, and knowledge,
of that hee doth, that hee
uſes, (oftentimes) to ſnort, or doe
ſome other diſpleaſing thing to bee
heard, or to bee ſeene, and very often
you ſhall finde him ſweating, and
his mouth open, with much filth in
it. It is alſo an ill cuſtome, to riſe
and ſtand upright, where others

are ſitting, and diſcourſing, or at ſuch
a time, to paſſe through the roome;
for they are like thoſe, which move
up and down, and ſtand skipping and
yawning and ſtretching themſelves,
turning themſelves from one ſide to
the other, that you would thinke,
at the very inſtant they were troubled
with an Ague or Palſy.
            3. They doe as ill in like manner:
who being in ſuch company, doe
draw a Letter, or Bill out of their
pockets, or boſome, and ſet themſelves
to read it before them.
            4. But they doe worſe, that with
ſiſers, or with a Knife, prepare, to cut,
or ſcrape their nailes: which is as
much, as if they eſteemed nothing of
the company, and that they muſt
finde other buſineſſe to paſſe away the
time.
            5. Nor ſhould we (as little) uſe
the manner, that ſome accuſtome
themſelves unto, to wit, to ſing between
the teeth, or to play with
the fingers, nor to ſhake our legges,
for hee that doth ſo, may be thought
to regard the company but little.
            6. Neither ought a man, ſo to turne
himſelfe, in his ſeate, or ſtanding,

that hee turne his back to another, nor
to lay one Legge upon another, ſo
high; that the part which our garment
ſhould cover, bee ſeene. Eſpecially
if hee bee a Divine; but much more
ought women to take heede of this,
whom ſtilneſſe doth beſt become, and
not to ſhuffle their feete up and
downe, nor to move or handle their
Knees.
            7. Nor ought any (as little) to
leane upon his elbowes at the Table,
nor to make much noiſe by knocking
his heeles againſt the ſeate hee ſits on,
for ſuch actions are not to be uſed, but
by ſuch perſons, which ſhew no reſpect
to any one. It is true, that if
a maſter, doe it before his ſervants,
or if it bee done in the preſence of a
friend, that is of meaner quality then
himſelfe: he ſhewes no pride in it, but
love, and friendſhip.
            8. A man ought to keepe himſelfe
upright, and not to reſt or leane upon
another, and when hee ſpeakes to
any one, hee muſt not thruſt him,
with his hand, or with his elbow, as
many uſe to doe at every word, ſaying
is it not true that I ſay? doe you heare
mee? and all the while they continue

jogging them, with laying their
hands on their breaſts, or playing
with their buttons; and I ſaw one, that
uſed this in ſuch ſort, that he unbuttoned
al he talked with. To conclude,
you ſhall have ſome, that will alwayes
ſit upon your Coate or Cloake,
or ſome other part of your cloathes,
that you may liſten to them, and are
never ſtill, nor can ſpeake quietly.
So that you may ſay, when you have
got out of their hands, that you are
as if you had bin ground or ſtamped
in a fulling mill.
            
               How we ought to be clothed.
               9. Every one ought to goe well
clad, according to his eſtate, and age:
for to doe otherwiſe, it ſeemes that
in ſeeking to be taken notice of, hee
deſpiſes the Nation, where he is, and
therefore, the Citizens of Padua run
out of their houſes, in meriment,
when they ſee any Venetian Gentlemen
walke through the ſtreete in a
Jerkin.
               10. And a man ought not onely to
cloathe himſelfe in fine cloath, ſilke
or ſtuffe, but to ſtrive to come as neere

as hee can) to the generall faſhion:
and to ſubmit to cuſtome, though
(perchance) hee ſuppoſe it leſſe uſefull,
or handſome then the old faſhion;
And if through the City it bee
the faſhion to weare the hayre very
ſhort, thou muſt not were a peruque,
nor when others weare great beards,
thou muſt not bee ſhaven, for this is
to contradict others, and we muſt not
thwart uſe, and cuſtome, but in caſe
of neceſſity, as we ſhall tell you hereafter:
for this may make us hatefull to
the people, more then any other ill
cuſtome.
               11. None muſt, (at any time) oppoſe,
or contradict, a commune uſage
in ſuch things, doe not thou therefore
alone weare in the ſtreetes a long robe
downe to the feete, when every body
elſe weares one very ſhort, but a little
below the girdle: leaſt it fall out nether
better, nor worſe unto thee, then
to him that hath a crabbed countenance
and rigid face, whoſe diſpoſition
is ſo unſavory, that every body
turnes to looke upon him, as upon
a wonder. It is the ſame thing with
them, which weare their cloathes
out of the faſhion, ſutable to their

owne humour and pleaſure: or doe
weare long hayre, and a great beard,
or extreame ſhort and ſhaven, contrary
to the cuſtome: or who (being
a young man) doth weare his Cap
very flat and broad, or a low crowned
Hat like a wives, or his ruffe and
cuffes of his ſhirt of too unſeeming a
greatneſſe and proportion. For at
all ſuch every body ſtands gaſing,
and doe point at them: whilſt they
themſelves are much pleaſed with this,
being thoſe, (in their owne conceites)
who have ſought to break a common
cuſtome, againſt all liking of the multitude.
               12. Their apparrell then muſt bee
very fit, and becoming their perſons,
becauſe thoſe that weare rich, and
noble apparrell, but ill ſhapen, and
deformed, are not thought to have
had them made for their bodies, and
doth demonſtrate, one of theſe two
things, either that they are careleſſe
of themſelves, or that they are ignorant,
what belonges to a good eſteeme,
modeſty or the complement which is
uſed amongſt men.
               13. As little good is it on the contrary,
to bee ſo extremely curious, in

this, that wee ſhould ſpend the moſt
of the time in adorning and tricking
of our ſelves. And ſome there bee of
ſuch an humour, that they place all
their pleaſure, happineſſe, and ſtudy,
upon their cloathes and outward
faſhion; And for ought elſe, are cold
and unprofitable, and of little ſubſtance
in their cariage, and converſation.
They ſerve but for gazing ſtockes,
and to bee pointed at in the ſtreetes,
and at meetings: ſo that others laugh
and make ſport and are diſcompoſed
at their trappings: as is uſed to bee
done at a maygame, or other like
paſtime; They are ſo punctually grave,
and ſetled in their cariage, as if they
were meere ſtatues, curiouſly painted
and ſet forth. And ſome of them are
ſo ſelfe conceited, and well pleaſed
with themſelves, that if they did ſee
themſelves in the water, as they doe
in their glaſſes, they could not be kept
from drowning themſelves like Narciſſus.
Theſe doe alſo ſo martyr their
bodies, in pinching, and ſweeſing
themſelves, that wee have ſeene ſome
that would not ſit all day, that they
might not ruffle their breeches, and
goe ſo pent up, that they are ſo galled,

that at night, when they goe to bed,
they are as weary as if they had bin all
day in a combate.
               14. At the time when the faſhion
came up of wearing trunck-hoſe, ſome
young men uſed ſo to ſtuffe them
with ragges, and other like things:
ſo that you might finde ſome that uſed
ſuch inventions, to extend them in
compaſſe, with as great eagerneſſe, as
ſome women doe (at this day) take
pleaſure, to weare great and ſtately
verdingales, which matter I will not
medle withall, becauſe it is ſo large,
and hath ſo many croniclers of it,
that it is every day ſpoken of; I will
onely ſay that the warineſſe that the
Women were wont to obſerve in
concealing of their feete is ſuddenly
paſſed to their necks, and by cuſtome
they have changed the place. So that
now if you enter to ſee a Lady who
perchance is unready, or in a careleſſe
faſhion, if you finde her without the
ſtarched, and ſet ruffe, which women
uſe to weare, (although you
may ſee her feete) by reaſon of her
verdingall, ſhee will firſt lay hand to
cover her neck, before ſhee will
ſtirre to cover her feete, whereas

heretofore, they did not onely not
cover them in their houſes, but did
goe abroad bare necked, and bare
breſted, another extreame cleane
contrary, to what is now uſed: but
let us returne to the maſculine verdingalls,
which is the pompe and the
bayes of their verdingall-breeches.
               15. I will here tell you what happened
to one, that thought hee excelled
ſo much in this faſhion, that he ſtuffed
a Follado of velvet that he did weare
with branne, and being ſet in ſeemely
manner amongſt ſome Ladyes, to
whom he deſired to ſhew his bravery,
and neatneſſe, as hee was talking
merrily, of ſomething that pleaſed
him, hee was ſo exceedingly taken
with delight that poſſeſſed him, that
hee could not take notice, of a ſmall
rent, which was made, with a nayle
of the Chaire hee ſat upon, in one of
his two pockets, of branne, (who,
though the harme was but in his hoſe
yet hee found it after in his hart) for
as he was moving, and ſtroaking himſelfe
(with much gallantry) the bran
begun to drop out by little and little
without his perceiving of it, but the
Ladies that ſat over againſt him, and

ſaw it (it being by his motion like
meale comming from the Mill as it
grindeth) laughed much at it and
looked one upon another, and the
gallant, ſuppoſing, that his good
behaviour, mirth, and ſporting, was
pleaſing to them, laughed with the
Ladies for company, and it ſo much
pleaſed him, that the more he ſtrove
to delight the company, the more
his Mill did grind forth the branne.
The laughter by little and little encreaſed,
and hee appeared as confident
as a man that hath ſhed much
blood by a wound, untill he eſpyed
the heape of branne, which came out
of his hoſe, and then hee begun to
recall himſelfe, and diſſembling his
ſhame, hee tooke his leave, and departed,
to mend the miſchiefe that
lay in ambuſh for him, as the proverb
goes, you may find out blood by
the foot-ſteps.
               16. Better profit then this did a
priſoner make of the lynings of his
breeches, who being to goe before the
Judge for a certaine cauſe hee was
accuſed of, it being at that time
when the Law was in force againſt
wearing bayes ſtuffed in their breeches,

and he then having ſtuffed his
breeches very full, the Judges tould
him, that hee did weare his breeches
contrary to the Law: who began to
excuſe himſelfe of the offence, and
endeavouring by little and little to
diſcharge himſelfe, of that which he
did weare within them, he drew out of
his breeches, a paire of ſheetes, two
table Cloathes, ten napkins, foure
ſhirts, a bruſh, a glaſſe, and a
combe, night-caps, and other things
of uſe, ſaying, (all the hall being
now ſtrewed with this furniture) your
highneſſe may underſtand, that becauſe
I have no ſafer a ſtore-houſe,
theſe pockets doe ſerve me for a roome
to lay up my goods in, and though
it be a ſtraight priſon, yet it is a ſtorehouſe
big enough for them, for I
have many things more of value yet
within it. And ſo his diſcharge was
accepted and well laughed at, and
they commanded him, that he ſhould
not alter the furniture of his ſtorehouſe,
but that he ſhould rid the hall
of his ſtuffe and keepe them as it pleaſed
him.
               17. But returning to the cuſtomes,
I ſay that there are ſome ſo wedded

to their wils, who though they much
diſpleaſe others, in the faſhion of
their cloathes, and may (according
to their yeares) goe more faſhionable,
they cannot bee brought unto
it, becauſe they will not conforme
themſelves to the common, and ordinary
cuſtome. And to this purpoſe,
they tell a ſtory of a neighbour of
Salamanca, who being a man of great
meanes went clad in an antick faſhion,
and he carried under his armes cloath
and new ſilks to make cloathes of, by
which men might ſee that he did it not
out of laviſhneſſe or to ſpoile them,
(for hee caried his expences along
with him, but to ſee who kept their
faſhion. For at that time the faſhions
rid poſt. Theſe are men very remarkable,
and utterly oppoſing policy and
credit, and good court-ſhip.
               18. It behoveth then that thy garments
bee ſutable to the cuſtome of
the people of thy yeares, and manner
of calling, for we have no power
to alter cuſtome, at our pleaſure and
deſire, ſo that wee muſt move with
the time. It is very true that it may
fall out, that wee may take liberty,
not to habit our ſelves, (punctually)

according to the faſhion: as when a
man hath very great legs, or very
ſmall, or extraordinary fat, in that
caſe a man may enlarge, or ſtreighten
his garments, a little more, then ordinary:
and in like manner, if any
be crooked or miſhapen he ought not
to weare cloathes of a very remarkeable
colour, that others be not thereby
invited, to behould his imperfections:
neither ought a practiſed,
and neate Courtier, to weare extraordinay
gawdy cloathes, nor too
old and careleſſe. Nor is it good
at any time, to labour to be remarkeable
in his apparrell, to the end hee
may bee diſtinguiſhed from the reſt,
but that every one appeare conformable
to his condition: therefore a
ſchollar ſhould not goe like a ſouldier,
nor a ſouldier like a ſcholler.
               19. Being in Rome with Lodowick
de Bavere, Caſtrucio, the Duke of Luca
and Senator of Rome, they reported,
that for gallantry and royalty, hee
ſent to have a robe made for him, of
crimſon Tabee, and that there ſhould
be written upon the breſt of it, a motto
(in letters of gold,) in this
manner: It is as good wils it, and

behind, upon the ſhoulders, another
in theſe words, and it ſhall bee, as
God will have it. This was a robe,
(in my opinion) better ſuting to his
Trumpetor, then to Caſtrucio himſelfe,
for potentates ought not to
make ſuch robes, though they bee
exempted from all rules. Nor doe I
commend King Manfred, for going
alwayes clad in greene, becauſe we
ought (alwayes) to eſteeme of that,
which is in uſe, without cauſing any
to ſpeake of, or to admire us. Even
as a diſcreete Embaſſador did, who
being to goe Embaſſador, to a ſtrange
Kingdome, and where it was ſayd,
they did weare many rude garments,
he ſent before where they were to procure
his lodging to one of the ſtewards
of his houſe to get him ſome apparrell
and houſhould ſtuffe faſhioned according
to the cuſtome of the Land:
and to ſee if pack-ſadles were in uſe,
and if they were, to buy one for him
of the better ſort, for that in ſuch
manner, Embaſſadors have bin ſeene,
to goe of Embaſſies, to forreine Kingdomes,
and when they firſt entred
therein, to cloath themſelves after the
faſhion of that Land. For this is the

way to obtaine better favour, and
better trafficke for his maſter. And
ſo I conclude this treatiſe of clothing:
That theſe that make little reckoning,
how they goe clad, are ill accepted
of, and gaine little love, in their
converſations.
            
         
         
            CHAPTER. 3. Of thoſe that are unſavoury in their
deedes and actions.
            WE formerly ſpake of thoſe
that make themſelves contrary
to the moſt, and are different
in their apparrell: And wee have
ſpoken (purpoſely) of the ill, that
extremes beget, but yet there are others,
that exceede all this, whoſe
ſuſpitious deeds, and workes are ſuch,
that no man can endure them: or
converſe with them: but by reaſon
of their ill condition, they thinke all
that they heare, or ſee, to be naught:
and doe coole all ſociety, and the
delight of thoſe, that eſteeme well
of it; and for the moſt part doe overthrow
all. And like to theſe, are

ſuch who when they are joyned in
ſociety, and ſet at the Table, to eate:
after they have waſhed their hands,
or it may bee when the meate is upon
the Table, doe make all the reſt to
wait for them, by either beginning
to write ſome letter, or finding
ſome other triviall buſineſſe, or doe
walke a little, ſaying, it is time enough,
they may ſtay a little, what
haſt is there yet, &amp;c. and make all
the company diſpleaſed with them,
as ſuch that reſpect nothing, but
their owne will: never conſidering
how diſpleaſing this is to the reſt of
the company there.
            1. The ſurpaſſing all the reſt are ſuch
who ſetting themſelves in the beſt places,
and being ſerved firſt before the
reſt, yet nothing contents them, but
that which themſelves, either ſpeak,
or doe, making mouthes and faces at
any thing elſe.
            2. Some others are ſo ſtrange, and ſo
averſe from reſtrayning their owne
wils, that nothing may be done which
is not according to their manner: And
doe alwayes make anſwer with a
ſoure countenance, to all is ſpoken,
and doe never leave chiding, and

brawling, threatning their ſervants,
and pages, and in this manner doe
perpetually diſturb all the company
(ſpeaking in this or the like ſort)
you called mee at a ſweete time this
morning, ſee how cleane you have
waſhed this. Why did you not goe
to Church with mee, you rogue,
beaſt, how can I forbeare to breake
thy head? all theſe are very uncivill
manners, to be uſed before any body.
And ſuch, that though a man
be in deede very humble, and doe not
out of malice uſe this cuſtome, but
for want of taking notice of it in himſelfe,
or by reaſon of an ill cuſtome,
yet for all this yet hee ſeemes to bee
proud in theſe outward actions:
and is ill thought of by the People,
for pride is nothing elſe but to eſteem
himſelfe better then another, For ſo
it is, that every one ought to bee
eſteemed of, and courteouſly uſed according
as wee eſteeme him to bee
worthy of it.
            3. As little ought wee to doe any
thing before others whom we deſire
to give content unto, which may ſavour
more of command, then friendſhip:
but we ought to manifeſt, that

wee beare a reverence, and an accompt
of the company, with whom
we converſe.
            4. For this cauſe it is eſteemed a
reprochfull thing, to brawle and give
ill language to ones ſervants, much
more to buffet them with our fiſts,
or to beate them with a cudgell,
which is (in a ſort) to ſeeke to exerciſe
ones power, and authority:
which we ought not to doe, in their
preſence, whom wee ought to reſpect.
Becauſe it gives them diſtaſt,
and doth much daſh the company,
eſpecially if it be at the Table, which
ſhould be a place of mirth, and not
of offence, and therefore we ought
not to be there in choler. And if by
chance one be diſpleaſed, hee ought
not to ſhew it, or make his trouble
to be knowne, eſpecially if you have
ſtrangers for your gueſts, for having
brought them thither to ſerve them,
and to give them content, in thus
doing, they doe torment them,
which is as if one were eating ſome
very tart, or bitter meate, which
we ſee makes thoſe that ſtand looking
on, to ſhew ill favoured actions,
and 
                  〈◊〉
                faces, ſo to ſee another

troubled doth trouble and vex us.
            5. We may in like manner ſay, that
they are crookedly made up, that are
contrary to others in all things: and
ſo you may ſee, that all contrariety
is ill, for thoſe that deſire to gaine
the affection of others, and labour to
bee well eſteemed; for to perſevere
only in contradiction, and to thwart
every mans pleaſure, is not the
behaviour of a friend, but of an enemy.
Therefore let every one labour
to rid himſelfe of this vice, eſpecially
thoſe that deſire to gaine the
peoples love, for inſteed of gayning
love, they will bee hated and have
ill will, but rather ſhould wee ſubject
our ſelves to anothers pleaſure,
that no diſgrace may ariſe to our
ſelves by the contrary.
            6. Nor ought any to ſhew himſelfe
rude or harſh, but mild and
affable, and wee muſt know that he
is ſayd to be courteous, whoſe converſation,
and conditions are ſuch,
(in his common uſe and cuſtome)
that he uſeth his friends like friends,
not accuſing or finding fault with
their actions, or with their words,
but he muſt beare with the infirmities

they are ſubject unto, and make as if
he ſaw them not, for he that carries
himſelfe ſtrangely, or leave the comcompany,
is counted uncivill and
rude, on the contrary mild and affable
men, are ſo good Courtiers,
that where ever they goe, you would
thinke they were amongſt their acquaintance,
and that they were every
bodies friend, gaining much applauſe
by their civill carriage, and
ſweete behaviour: we muſt therefore
ſalute men with a pleaſing geſture
and good language, and anſwer in a
ſweete manner, as if every one were
his countryman, or acquaintance.
            7. Some act this part very ill, who
are ſo ſad, and of ſo ſetled a countenance,
that they cannot ſhew any
body a good looke, and doe anſwer
all queſtions, with no ſuch as theſe
cannot receive the honour, acceptance,
nor endeerment that others
procure, and are ſo rude that they
are not to bee viſited, nor doe give
any content, nor are ſtirred, or delighted
with any diſcourſe, or matters
of pleaſure, but doe refuſe all
offers, and if any be ſent unto them,
to let them know that ſuch a Lord

commanded him to ſalute and viſite
him, they anſwer, what care I for
his viſits, or ſalutes: or if he tell them
ſuch a one ſent mee to ſee how you
doe, hee will anſwer let him come and
feele my pulſe: ſuch as theſe deſerve
little love of any body.
            
               Of punctualities and neatneſſe.
               8. Nor is it good for any to bee
melancholy, and ſad, nor to ſhew any
ſigne of it, to thoſe we converſe, and
communicate withall, becauſe this
is fitting only for ſome ſtudents and
contemplative men, that are converſant
in the ſtudies of ſome of the
liberall ſciences, And therefore they
doe contrive to paſſe their ſadneſſe alone
by themſelves.
               9. Much leſſe ſhould a man be ſo
curious, and ſo apt to finde fault,
that men muſt as they ſay, walke alwayes
in print: for to keepe company
with ſuch, is rather a torment then
a ſociety, and many of theſe are ſo
britle as it were, and punctuall, that
they will ſtand ſtrictly conſidering,
what title you gave them: and if you
bee never ſo little negligent towards

them then there ariſeth quarrells, and
wranglings, ſaying, you called mee
not Sir, nor worſhipfull, nor did
you at the Table, give mee place according
to my deſart, and that was
fit for me. You came not to viſit me
at my lodging, after I had bin at
yours: you ſhould not doe thus, to a
man of my quality, and many ſuch
like ſpeeches, that no man can ſuffer
or indure. For they ſo exceſſively
love themſelves, that they have no
leiſure nor place to regard others:
and ſo they eaſily and for very trifles,
ſpoile all their friendſhip, making it
like to friendſhip that is covered with
a moſt curious vaile, whereby it cannot
be pleaſing, but very unacceptable:
which tender delicatneſſe, and
behaviour, ſhould be left to women,
I meane to ſome, who are ſo nice,
and full of fault finding that they
place all their reputation, in punctillio's,
and ſpend more time to make
good their fooleries, then is needfull,
by reaſon of the jelouſy, and little
reckoning they make one of another.
I ſpeak this without prejudice
to the moſt who are of a better behaviour,
and of ſo ſweete a converſation,

that we ſhould doe exceeding
well, to learn to imitate them.
            
         
         
            CHAPTER. 4. How wee ought to ſpeake.
            WE may erre in our ſpeech,
many, and ſundry wayes:
And firſt in the matter
we propoſe, which ought not to be
frozen, or of no ſubſtance, nor baſe
and vile, leaſt they that heare us, inſteed
of receiving pleaſure, doe ſcoffe
both at us and at our diſcourſe alſo.
            1. Nor in civill converſation, ought
a man to ſhew himſelfe very ſubtill,
or curious, in his diſcourſe: becauſe
ſo doing, hee will make himſelfe
hardly to be underſtood of the moſt:
and hee that is to ſpeake, ought to
take good heede, that his ſpeech bee
not ſuch, nor his carriage, that any
by ſtander be made aſhamed therewith,
nor made to bluſh, or to receive
any gird, or affront thereby.
            2. Much leſſe ought one to ſpeake
beaſtly, or ſilthily, though the auditory
ſeeme pleaſed with it: for it

is not ſit, for civill perſons, to ſtudy
to give others content, but in honeſt
and decent things.
            
               That men ought to ſpeake with reverence
in things appertayning unto
God.
               3 Much more ought every one take
heede, that in ſuch meetings, hee
ſpeake not inconſiderately, of holy
things, nor to make jeſts, and ſport of
them, for ſuch uſe belonges to ill
mannered men, and wee ſhall finde
many ſo diſcreete, that they will preſently
depart ſuch company that they
heare to ſpeake of ſuch things unadviſedly,
and without reverence.
               4. And we ought, not only to ſpeak
holily, and with much reverence, and
conſideration, in things concerning
God, but a curious man ought, in
all his diſcourſe, to provide that his
words may give a teſtimony, of his life
and workes.
               5. For if when we bee in the company
of people of quality and thoſe
that be curious, wee endevour that
we may not erre in our diſcourſe nor
to give due precepts, and adviſe, but

more eſpecially when wee are before
our parents, or powerfull friends, to
whom we owe reſpect, and doe tie
our ſelves, to a decent behaviour,
and an humble carriage, becauſe we
may be their creatures, and favourites:
how much greater care, and
vigilancy, ought wee to uſe in the
Church, and holy places, eſpecially
at the time when any religious office
is doing there? This is a thing that
every body well knowes, therefore I
neede not to ſpeake much of it: yet
that we may doe that, which behoves
us ſo much, let us have Gods word
alwaies in our hands, out of which
the Preachers, and Miniſters, doe
propoſe examples unto us. Conſider
therefore onely what gravity is there
required, though it ſeeme to bee but
policy, ſo to behave thy ſelfe in the
Church that no body may take notice
of thee. Hence wee may gather how
ill they doe, that are talking and are
unquiet in ſuch places and at ſuch
holy exerciſes: nor ought any there
to make legges, and complements,
with ſuch noiſe, as if they were at
the Court, nor to depart the holy
Table with a light cariage, but ſhewing

modeſty, and humility, nor ought
any to behave himſelfe ſo, that hee
may draw mens eyes upon him;
nor to lie lolling on one ſide or
curiouſly to gaſe upon thoſe that
are entring into, or are in the Church.
Nor to make antick geſtures, and
ſtrange faces, when thou prayeſt, as
many uſe to doe, often lifting up their
hands, above their heads, and
flinging abroad their armes and
ſtretching themſelves, as thoſe doe
that are newly awakened out of ſleep:
kiſſing their fingers, and uſing ſuch other
exterior actions, and geſtures,
which trouble them, that are neere
them, by drawing all their eyes upon
them. But God is better ſerved, with
the heart, then with outward ſhewes:
therefore to conclude, ſhew thy ſelfe
there rather like the poore Publican,
then the proud Phariſee.
               
               6. And if there be any thing there,
that may procure laughter, yet let
it not hinder thy devotion; it is true,
that ſometimes, there fall out things
in the Church, that would require
us to ſettle our countenances, and
doe even caſt thoſe off the hookes
(as they ſay) that ſee, or heare

them: to this purpoſe I cannot omit,
though it be from the ſubject, to relate
ſome impertinencies, which
have happened in this kinde, as of an
old woman, who every time the Prieſt
ſayd Dominus vobiſcum, or the Lord
be with you, thinking the words to
bee obiſpos, which ſignifyes in the
Spaniſh tongue, Biſhops: alwayes
prayed, that the Biſhops, Patriarchs,
and Cardinals, would be her helpers:
and to the ſame purpoſe, I have bin
credibly enformed, that ſuch a pratling
woman as this, recommending
to God, the good eſtate of her family,
amongſt other things, that ſhe
required, prayed thus, I beſeech thee
my Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that for ſuch
a one my daughter, thou grant mee
a rich and wiſe husband, a Gentleman,
no gamſter, whoremonger, nor
given to any vice, and a thouſand
like impertinencies: and at laſt, when
ſhee could not remember, what more
to pray for, ſhee prayed that whilſt
ſhee was thus praying, her pot might
not burne to, or boyle over, and that
ſhee might finde it, at her returne,
well boyled, and ſeaſoned. No doubt
any that heares ſuch impertinencies,

can hardly forbeare to laugh, and
muſt either depart, to another place,
or marre his devotion, with theſe or
the like things: wherefore if by
chance, any heare, or ſee things, that
force him to laugh, let it be ſo wary,
that thoſe that are neere him, may not
perceive it.
               7. Let us now returne, (with our
Galatheo) to conſider, what we ought
to doe, in our converſation. I have
ſayd that it is very blame worthy, to
talke of things, which are much
thwarting the times, and the perſons,
that heare us. (Alſo in feaſts, and at
meales, wee ought not to move ſad
diſcourſes.) But men ought to ſpeake
of ſuch things, which are proper for
the perſons, and place, and are well
liked of. And therefore in meriments,
and at feaſts, melancholick ſtoryes,
are not to be tould, as of ſickneſſes,
and deaths, misfortunes, peſtilence,
or the like: nor to call to minde, or
mention, any mournfull matter, but
if any fall upon ſuch diſcourſe, wee
ought in a merry, and ſweete manner,
to divert him, from ſuch talke, and
offer other ſubjects, to talke of, more
convenient, and cheerefull. I have

heard ſay of an old Philoſopher, that
he affirmed, that for the preſervation
of mans life, it is neceſſary, that
there be a time to weepe, as well as
to laugh. And that for that reaſon,
he ſayd, that of old, thoſe ſad fables,
which they called Tragedyes, were
invented, by acting of which, upon
the ſtage, (as was then uſuall to doe)
they might make thoſe ſhed teares
who had neede ſo to doe, and by
ſuch weeping, they might be cured of
their infirmities. But for that which
concernes us, it becomes us not, to
make ſad the mindes of thoſe wee
diſcourſe with, but ſhould rather labour
to ſolace, and delight them.
For if it were true, that any ſhould
be ſick for lack of weeping, it would
be a ſmall matter, to cure that diſeaſe,
either with a little ſtrong muſtard,
or by enduring a little ſmoake.
And ſo muſt we as it is ſayd at ſuch
times, avoyd melancholy diſcourſes.
               8. We ought alſo, to interrupt him,
that talkes impertinently, and waſtes
much time, and talke, only for their
pleaſure. Like ſome, that even fattened
with the love they beare their little
children, doe talke of nothing but

of them, and their nurſes, in this
manner, this is ſo pretty a child, and
makes me alwayes ſo merry that you
cannot imagine it. My little girle, is
very delightfull to mee, ſhee ſpeakes
already mum, Dad, and many other
ſuch words. And they ſuppoſe that
as they themſelves are pleaſed with
this, and doe ſpend their time therein,
ſo muſt they, that heare them,
take the like paſtime: although for
certaine, no man can bee ſo much
taken heerewith, that hee can bee delighted,
to ſpend his time, alwayes
in hearing the ſame things, eſpecially
when the Fathers doe bring in ſuch
diſcourſe, by the head and ſhoulders
as we uſe to ſay.
            
         
         
            CHAPTER, 5. Of thoſe that ſet themſelves to tell their
dreames.
            THey doe ill that make a ſetled
diſcourſe, in the punctuall relating
of their dreames, in ſuch earneſt,
and ſo wondring at them, that the
telling of them becomes a torment to

the hearer of them, except hee that
tels them do finde ſome wonder indeede
in them, or at leaſt ſo much
witty conceit, in ſome of them, that
he knowes that the humours of them
that heare him being prepared for
ſuch diſcourſe, they will finde paſtime
in them. And though ſome wiſe
men of old, did leave bookes behind
them, written of dreames, and thoſe
compoſed with great underſtanding,
and acuteneſſe of wit, yet we in our
ordinary converſation, ought not to
diſcourſe of them.
            
               A dreame of example:
               1. And of all the Dreames I ever
heard related, (though I have heard
but few, and given credit to none)
that me thinkes was the beſt which
they report, that one Micer Flaminio
a Gentleman of Rome did Dreame,
which me thinkes was very materiall
and of much conſideration. Hee
thought in his ſleepe, that he was ſitting
in a ritch apothecaryes ſhop, that
was his neighbour, and not knowing
the reaſon, he ſaw that all the people,
with great tumult tooke away all

that was in it, and one tooke an electuary,
another tooke away ſweet
meates, one, one thing, another, another,
and then they fell of eating, in
ſuch a manner, that there was neither
box, glaſſe, pot, or viall, but it was
quite emptyed, and amongſt them
there was a little viall glaſſe, full of a
cleere liquour, which all ſmelt unto,
but none of them did eate it; and it
was not long, but he ſaw a man of a
great ſtature, being ancient, and of a
venerable countenance, who beholding
the pots, and glaſſes, and finding
one crackt, another overturned,
and moſt part of them broken, hee
caſt his eye, upon the little viall-glaſſe,
I ſpake of: and ſetting it to his
mouth, he drunke out all the liquour
not leaving one drop, and then went
out, as the reſt had done before him;
at which Micer Flaminio ſeemed to
wonder much, and turning to the
Apothecary, he asked him, Sir what
thing is this, and why hath this honorable
old man, drunke up ſo ſavourly,
the water in the little viall,
which the others refuſed. To whom
the Apothecary anſwered: Sonne this
venerable man, is our Lord, and the

water which hee (alone of all the
reſt) did drinke up, (which you ſaw
was refuſed) is the diſcretion, to
judge rightly of things, the which
men doe not ſeeke to preſerve, in any
thing in this World.
               2. Such Dreames as this may well
be told, and be excuſed, becauſe they
rather ſeeme to bee good thoughts,
of a man awake, then a viſion of
a troubled phanſy. But for other
Dreames, voyd of ſence, or probability,
as for the moſt part, even learned
men (themſelves) doe dreame,
as well as the unlearned, wee ought
not to ſpend our time, in telling of
them.
            
         
         
            CHAPTER, 6. Of Lyars.
            THough wee may thinke, that
there is nothing of leſſe moment,
then Dreames: yet for all this,
wee ſee other things that are worſe,
and more idle, and vaine: as namely
lyes, or falſe Tales, for of that which
a man hath ſeene in his Dreame, may
be ſayd ſomething, becauſe all a mans
life is but as it were a certaine Dream,

or Phanſy, but a man never dreamt
a lye. Therefore wee ought leſſe to
trouble the eares, and underſtandings,
of thoſe that hate lying, with Lyes
then with Dreames. Becauſe although
they being but Jeſts, yet this danger
is in them, that ſometimes, they are
taken for truth; Yet amongſt good
conditioned people, Lyars doe receive
this reward, that becoming
firſt reckoned, but as Jeſters, they are
afterwards people of no credit, and
their diſcourſe is ſcarce excuſable,
as being frothy words, without ſubſtance.
And it is neither more nor
leſſe, then as if when ſuch a one
ſpeakes, as if he ſayd nothing: or as
if he did but draw, and breath out
the ayre. And you muſt know, that
you may talke with ſome that love
lying ſo well, that they will lye,
though it be to no end, nor profit to
them: but onely, becauſe a lye of
their owne, doth much pleaſe them.
Even as a Drunkard, that often drinketh,
not for thirſt, or neede he hath,
but only for the love of the drinke,
and they are ſo beſotted in telling
lyes, that though they tell impoſſibilities,
they thinke they muſt be believed.

As I once heard tell of a Lyar,
that related of himſelfe that hee one
day, being very thirſty, and being a
very good markes-man, ſhot a pellet
at a Pitcher of water, that ſtood in
a garret window, and made a round
hole in it, and that preſently from
thence, there came to him a Conduitpipe
with water, to which he ſet his
mouth, and drunke his fill. And
when he perceived, that he had hitherto
given content to the company,
he continued his diſcourſe, in this
manner: That afterward, hee ſhot at
the ſame Pitcher another bullet that
was ſomewhat bigger, and hit it ſo
juſt in the ſame place that he ſtopped
the hole ſo tite, that on drop of
water could not come out, &amp; though
the lye were well laughed at, yet one
that ſtood by, knowing it to be a very
vaine glorious humour in him, and it
being tedious to him, anſwered him,
Sir your worſhip ſpends your time
in vaine, and you tire us all, and he
that thinkes hee can make us believe
this, muſt either take us for fooles,
or his enemies. Another anſwered
him thus, Sir I have ſeene Lyars before,
but your worſhip may bee the

Kings Lyer, better then any I ever yet
ſaw or heard of.
            1. Some others doe lie onely for
vaine glory, relating what wonders
they have done, and to bee thought
great Souldiers, and Stateſmen, and
ſtrive to entertaine men, with things
ſo incredible, that one may ſmell the
lye, a league off: and ſo can gaine
no credit from their auditory, except
they bring witneſſe to prove all they
ſay. That we may ſee how they come
infected with the Plague of vaine
glory, thoſe I meane that bely their
deedes and works, You may underſtand.
            2. Men may as well lye in concealing
themſelves (to wit) in their
workes, and actions from every one,
like ſome that being but of an ordinary
quality, in reſpect of their perſons,
and places, do pretend they
are much more, and uſe ſuch ceremonies,
and doe ſo Lord it, in their
manner of cariage, as if they were
Dukes, and Earles. Theſe doe ſet
themſelves to ſpeake with ſuch ſtate,
as if they were ſpeaking from the
bench, going in ſuch a poſture, that
they would be thought to be the head,

whereas they are but the feete: labouring
in their actions, to imitate
men of great ranke, and in the furniture
of their houſes, that it is a torment
to ſee, how ignorant they are
of their weakeneſſe, and that they
cannot let their heads blood of theſe
vanities.
            3. There are ſome others that lie
in this manner, who wearing but
meane cloathes, doe gild themſelves
over with Chaines, and Ringes, and
medalls, which they faſten heere, and
there about them: that you would
thinke they carryed them about, rather
to ſell them then to make themſelves
gallant; And you may ſee
their pride and vanity a mile off, that
place their worth onely, in the back
or outward appearance: which are
things diſpleaſing, and much diſconſonant
to reaſon, and good
faſhion.
            4. And you muſt know that in many
and (thoſe) the beſt Cities, it is
not ſuffered, that any ritch man be
ſeene much diſtinguiſhed from a poore
man, in the alteration of his faſhion,
becauſe the poore men thinke they
receive reproach, eſpecially if they

be honorable, or well borne: when others
make ſuch difference in their
cloathing from them.
         
         
            CHAPTER, 7. Of Gaming.
            ANd before we proceede, we will
heere (by the by) ſpeake of
that, the doing whereof, is ill
ſpending the time, yea the worſt
ſpent, and ſometimes more hurtfull,
then either telling of Dreames, or
Lyes, namely that which we ſpend in
Gaming.
            1. And therefore he that would be
accompted a gallant Courtyer, muſt
not play for coveteouſneſſe to win:
eſpecially at Cards, or Dice: for it
is plainely ſeene, that he that ſpends
his time, and meanes in gaming, hath
no leaſure, for Court-ſhip, or ſweet
and pleaſing cariage, and behaviour,
ſutable to the drift, that this treatiſe
aimes at. For if he play for much,
you may underſtand, that his intent
is no other, but a greedy deſire to
encreaſe his eſtate, by his friends

loſſe: and ſo play, doth by this meanes
looſe the proper name it ſignifyes,
which is ſport, or jeſt and not earneſt,
nor to be ſo ſerious a thing as it
may ſeeme to be by thoſe that make
it their whole buſineſſe. And in effect
they make a vice of that, which may
be vertuous, for in uſing it onely as
play, and keeping a moderation in that
we play for, and the time wee ſpend
in it, it is a converſe, to paſſe away
our idle time, without prejudice, or
hurt to any: eſpecially for thoſe that
have no offices nor charges to employ
themſelves in, but are idle and
want buſineſſe, and have not to doe
but to phanſy Chymeraes in their
braines. Thoſe that play for paſtime,
muſt play for little, and that with
their friends, and acquaintance: and
at ſuch Games, as are fit, for civill
people, but having no skill in play,
thou oughteſt not to bet, though it be
never ſo little, nor to play with thoſe,
that are cholerick, and ill conditioned,
but with thoſe, thou mayeſt be
merry, and pleaſant withall; for there
are ſome, that are ſo quick, that they
grow in choler, and chafe like mad
men, and beate the Cards againſt the

Table, and give ill language, tending
to ill wiſhings, and reproach: And
yet theſe Gameſters, doe ordinarily
ſay, when they looſe, that they are not
ſo impatient, for loſſe of their monies,
but for their ill luck.
            2. The truth is, that let the game be
never ſo ſmall we play at, it troubles
us too much to looſe: and ſuch as
theſe, if at firſt, we know their humour,
it is beſt not to play with them
the ſecond time. Heere then I will
make an end of this matter, and that
with a jeſt, that a certaine Cavalleere
broke upon ſome, that were, playing
at Primero, and it was this: it happened,
there being certaine diſcontents,
amongſt the Gameſters, he aſked
them, why they were ſo offended,
and one of them anſwered, Sir
becauſe we are heere playing at foolery,
if you play at that Game ſayd
hee, you may vie it without feare,
and make large ſtakes, for you have all
enough of that, left to looſe: and in
this merry way they were contented
to be jeered, and ſo will I leave them,
to proceed with my quaint Galateo.
            
         
         
            
            CHAPTER, 8. Of Boaſting.
            AS little ought a diſcreete man,
and one of quality to fall ſuddenly
into a diſcourſe of his
nobility, and diſcent, nor of his honour,
and riches, much leſſe to commend
himſelfe for his former valourous
acts: or to draw them into his
diſcourſe, upon every occaſion: as
many are wont to doe, ſeeming thereby,
to make compariſons, with every
one that ſtands neere them, by
which meanes, if (peradventure)
they be of meane condition, they doe
as it were vilify them, and hit them
in the teeth, with their miſtortunes,
and poore eſtate. Which is a thing
much diſpleaſing unto every one.
And into this fault, we ſee them fall,
that have but very little ſpirit: and
the little goodneſſe they have, is not
very eminent in their bodies.
            1. And for this reaſon, a man ought
not, either to abaſe, or to exalt himſelfe,
beyond reaſon, and ſhould rather

let ſome of his merits vaniſh as
the Ayre, then to ſhew any arrogancy
in his words, for even the good which
may bee found in this caſe, when
it is much ſtood upon contenteth not;
Being but vaine glory, cloaked with
humility: on the other ſide, wee
muſt underſtand, that thoſe who
(by words) doe without meaſure,
either extoll their owne worth, or
diſpraiſe it, and ſeeme to deſtroy
thoſe honours, which doe manifeſtly
belong unto them, ſhew more pride
therein, then thoſe that doe uſurpe
ſuch honours, that they never merited.
And therefore ſome will ſay
that (by chance) the wiſe Giotto, did
not deſerve the title of maſter, which
was given him, becauſe hee refuſed
it, for you muſt know, that at that
time he was not onely a maſter, but
the moſt famous maſter of all others.
And therefore it is certaine,
that hee that ſhunneth to bee called
by the title that hee deſerveth, and
that which all of his condition, doe
challenge to themſelves, ſhewes alſo
that he undervalues all the reſt. And
ſo in like manner to ſet light by the
honour, and renoume, which is ſo

much ſet by, is a kinde of boſting
and extolling himſelfe, above others;
For it is true, that none of
ſound judgement will refuſe things
ſo well liked, and are obteyned by a
mans virtue and ſtudy, except hee, that
holds them to bee very idle, and
ſuperfluous. Nor ought wee to bee
vaine glorious, of our wealth, and
riches, like ſome who are ſo well
pleaſed with them, that with a little
applauſe of thoſe that are about them,
doe make circles on the ground, and
markes with their ſwordes, or ſome
other thing, very ſeriouſly deciphering
out, their purchaſes, and wealth,
and making repreſentations, of
Townes, and Armies, and that (moſt
uſually) before thoſe that never knew
what belonged to warre. Like ſome,
that frame ſuch like diſcourſe as this,
that followes; Heere is (Sirs) the Fort,
the Enemy aproached on this ſide,
and our men marched there, I marched
in the van, &amp;c:
            
               Of Bablers.
               It is accounted but a ſport to heare
men talke thus, to thoſe which frequent,

and devote themſelves to Tavernes,
and tipling houſes; and are
very looſely given: who when they
bee well loden with wine doe grow
enraged, and adding fuell (thereby)
to their naturall inclinations, they
thinke they are able to command all
the World: and when ſuch a talkative
fellow as this, conſiders in what
accompt hee is, amongſt his Companions,
there is no more to be ſayd,
for hee muſt onely controule and
governe all; And then you ſhall ſee
him frame himſelfe, to Bable thus,
Sir the World is all naught, there
is nothing cottens, I wonder by the
faith of a King, the Mores doe not
breake in upon us, and even come into
our Houſes: if I had the governement
in my hands, I would make
the Cock crow otherwiſe: and ſo he
prepares himſelfe for another full
Cup.
               2. I cannot omit, (heere) to tell
what I once (my ſelfe) did ſee, in
Vallodolid having my Lodging next
the market place, and where was
(uſually) a Taverne, and an Ordinary
for thoſe that came thither, to
runne races, where out of a dyning

Roome, that overlooked the ſayd
Taverne, I could heare, and ſee all
the paſſages were done there. At that
time, one Sacamuellas Caſtromocho, a
learned man, and one that then knew
well, how to bang the Pitcher, was
preſident, who being there with others
of his kindred, and camarades
one day after dinner, when they had
well filled their bellies, one began to
make a doubt, and to move this
queſtion. Tell mee now my Lord
Caſtromocho, and you other brave cavalleeres
heere preſent, which is the
pureſt Plant which is at this day to
be found in the World: one ſayd the
Lily, another the July-flower, a third
named the Tulip: and ſo in this
manner, were many reckoned up,
every one giving the beſt reaſon hee
could for his opinion. But Caſtromocho
putting forth his hand and commanding
ſilence, ſayd unto them.
Now ſurely none of you come neere
the matter, therefore confeſſe you
are conquered. And know, that the
pureſt Plant, that is in the World,
is the Nettle, for whereas all the reſt
may bee made foule, and you may
take them in your hand and doe what

you will with them; the Nettle
you cannot, for it defends it ſelfe
againſt you. All the company yielded
to it, but when the matter was
ended, Sacomuelas called for Wine,
and ſo did all the reſt: and the moſt
of them tooke ſuch refreſhinges, ſo
voyd of water, that it appeared very
pleaſing to their eyes, to be beheld
in the Glaſſe. And then another of
the company asked of another difficulty
in this manner. Tell mee now
my Lord Caſtromocho, and all your
honours, whither the ſoule goes to
reſt, when it goes out of the body.
Caſtromocho anſwered, let every one
elſe, firſt tell his opinion, and then
at the laſt, I will determine the queſtion;
and then ſome ſayd into Heaven,
others ſaid into Hell, and a third
into purgatory, according to every
ones opinion, but Caſtromucho concluded
with his declaration, ſaying,
give attention, you muſt know that
the ſoule going out of the body,
goes directly to S. Iames of Galicia,
alwayes excepted, that if he weare not
a Drawer, for that they would not
goe that way, but a worſe; and with
this concluſion, and with other noiſe

that hee made, he fell aſleepe, to ſpend
his drunken humour; and ſo concluded
this illuſtrious ſociety. But let
us leave him ſleeping, till hee may
be awakened, peradventure then hee
will bee of another opinion, then he
was formerly, and let us returne to
them that weare blacke Cloakes, of
whom we have purpoſely dealt withall
concerning boaſting. I ſay that
every one ſhould bee ſilent in things
that concerne his owne praiſes, as
much as he may, but if by chance
any occaſion, or opportunity, enforce
any of us, to ſpeake any thing
of them, it is a commendable Cuſtome
to ſpeake the truth, mildly
and ſoftly, and in a certaine careleſſe
manner, without uſing much
reſtraint: and for this reaſon, they
that take pleaſure, in quaint Courtſhip,
ought to abſtaine from this,
which ſome accuſtome themſelves unto,
namely to deliver their opinions
ſo reſolutely, upon any thing, giving
a definitive ſentence, to heare
whom it is irkſome; But exſpect what
they would ſay, is more torment to
utter in vaine preambles of their good
education.
               
                  
3. Such are thoſe men, that ſpeak nothing
but preambles, to ſhew their
manners, as if they ſhould ſay, Sir I
beſeech your worſhip, to pardon me:
if perchance I am ignorant, how to
make your worſhip conceive me, becauſe
I ſpeake ſo rudely, according to
my little knowledge, I am ſure your
worſhip, will laugh at me, yet to
obey you, I will not forbeare to
ſpeake that you command me: and ſo
they ſtand ſo long in ſuch circumſtances,
that any queſtion how hard
ſoever, may be determined with fewer
words, then they waſt in ſuch circumloquutions.
               4. In like manner, are they very
troubleſome and tedious, in the overacting
of their cariage, or in taking
their places, ſhewing themſelves mean,
and humble, and ſetting themſelves
in the loweſt, whereas the firſt and
chiefeſt place is due unto them; and
they alwayes ſtrive, to be one of the
laſt, which is a great trouble, to ſee,
ſo much time ſpent, to make them
goe before, And oftentimes they will
ſtand hearing a diſcourſe or ſome other
thing, with much pleaſure, and
attention: and ſo whilſt the Gentleman

is giving you teſtimony of his
good breeding by going on foote, he
is troubleſome to you in making you
waite for his comming, and ſo they
ſtrive vainegloriouſly to bee thought
humble, by meanes of their feigned
hypocriſy. So that the more you call
them, the more doe they draw back,
getting behind by little and little,
and are like ſtarting Horſes that cannot
be gotten forward; and therefore
thoſe that are uſed to good manners
finding the inconvenience that ariſeth
from this troubleſomeneſſe, that
they may not breake the thread of
ſociety, hould it leſſe inconvenient,
to take the place, or ſeate is offered
them, though it bee better then they
ſhould have, rather then give occaſion
to this tumult, that may be occaſioned
by them, in doing otherwiſe.
And when men enter or depart
ſuch ſocieties, the experienced Courtiers,
hould it for better breeding,
to doe nothing, but readily to come
in, and readily to goe out, yea even
without putting off your hat, or taking
leave, rather then to uſe endleſſe
ceremonies, as many uſe to doe.
            
         
         
            
            CHAPTER, 9. Of Ceremonies.
            BY that which we have ſayd, you
may underſtand that ſuperfluous
ceremonies, are to be avoyded,
which were of leſſe uſe, amongſt the
ancients, then now they are; and this
vaine uſe of them, ſeems like to the
Lyes, and Dreames, which I have before
ſpoken of, for the much vanity
is in them, and wee doe improperly
call them ceremonies. For of old,
ceremonies were taken, for that
ſolemnity, that the Prieſts did uſe
at the Altars, in their divine offices,
belonging to holy things, that concerned
Gods Worſhip. But now that
name hath bin uſurped upon, ever
ſince men began, to reverence one another,
bowing, and wreathing themſelves
in their congies, in an artificiall
manner, in token of their obſervance
vailing their bonnets, and calling
men Lords, and giving them other
extraordinary titles, Kiſſing their
Hands, as if they were hallowed: And
ſome ſeeing this cuſtome ſo new, and

of ſuch importance amongſt men, called
it ceremonie, by a new phraſe,
or manner of ſpeaking, as in like manner
we call, eating, and making merry,
(in a jeering way) a triumph.
            1. Ceremonies then if we looke at
the intentions of thoſe that uſe them,
are a certaine vaine expreſſion, of
honour, and reſpect toward him
unto whom we doe give reverence,
and it conſiſteth, as well in the countenance,
and geſture, as it doth in our
words, ſtuft with great titles, and
high expreſſions. And I call it vaine,
becauſe wee honour to the eye and
in outward apperance, thoſe that in
our hart we honnour not, and wee
nevertheleſſe uſe this ceremony towards
them that we may not be out
of the faſhion; and we call one illuſtrious,
or ſuch an one my moſt noble
Lord: and doe profeſſe our ſelves
their ſervants, and creatures, when
wee never intend any ſervice unto
them. And ſo ſuch ceremony, may
not only be accompted for Lyes: but
a certaine falſhood, and treachery,
and ſuch men as theſe, doe ſo proceede
in theſe illuſtrious titles, and
other ceremonies (which wee formerly

ſpoken of) that never regarding
the merits, nobility, eſtate or
quality of the perſon, they doe give
them to any one, what ever hee bee,
ſo that oftentimes you cannot diſtinguiſh
mechanick people, from the
nobility, and men of quality, by the
manner of converſe, and ceremonies,
that men uſe towards them. And as
it is true, that anciently, there were
ſet, and diſtinct titles, appointed for
every one, as a Pope, an Emperour,
and the like, which men could not
omit, without being uncivill to him
that had ſuch title; ſo could they
as little bee given to them to whom
they belonged not, without diſgrace
unto them. But now (in our age,)
we ſee that ſuch titles, and expreſſions
of honour may bee uſed more
freely. Becauſe cuſtome is a moſt
powerfull commander, and now it
gives us a larger priviledge to uſe
them.
            2. That cuſtome which ſeemes
good without, is within idle, and
conſiſtes in ſhewes, without ſubſtance,
and in words without ſignification:
and yet, we may not alter
them, but muſt imitate them, for it

is not our fault, but the fault of the
age we live in, yet we muſt doe it
diſcreetly; in which we are to conſider,
that ceremonies, and compliments,
are performed in three manners,
namely for profit, for vanity, for
obligation.
            
               Firſt Ceremonie for profit.
               3. For profit, we intend every Lye
that is ſpoken, for the particular intereſt,
and profit of him that ſpeakes
it, and this is a ſinfull fraud, and a
diſhoneſt thing, for a man cannot
lye honeſtly, and this ſinne doe flatterers
commit, who (As it is reported
of the Chameleon, that hee
changeth himſelfe into the colour
of that place they put him in) ſo in
like manner, tranſforme themſelves
into the ſhape of friends, and are conformable
to every bodies humour, be
it what it will, not to pleaſe us, but
to gaine ſomething by us, not to give
us content, but to coſen us, and
though this by chance may ſeeme a
pleaſing vice, unto thoſe, that are
vaine gloriouſly given, get for all this,
it is (in it ſelfe conſidered) abominable,

and damnable: and therefore a
well faſhioned man ought not to uſe
it, for if ſuch ceremonies, as theſe,
be but Lyes, and flatteryes, when ever
we uſe them for our owne profit, then
ſurely we doe ſo often act the parts of
naughty, and falſe-hearted men, and
therefore no ſuch ceremonies ſhould
be uſed.
            
            
               Secondly, Ceremonie for vanity.
               The ſecond Ceremonie, (which
we ſayd men uſed for vanity) is (as
we have formerly ſayd) when to make
our ſelves be thought to have bin well
educated, (Although wee ayme at
nothing but vaine glory therein) we
give unto any, greater titles then
their due, and wee offend thus by
giving too much, that they may doe
the like to us: and theſe, are plaine
and noted Flatteryes, ſo that they
that ſpeake, and uſe them, to this end,
beſides that they are ſo ill in themſelves,
are offenſive, and troubleſome
to others: being ſo contrary to all
truth.
            
            
               
               Thirdly, Ceremonie for Obligation.
               The third manner of Ceremonies,
are ſuch as are done for Obligation
or for deſart, and are not to be omitted,
and therefore they that forbeare
to uſe them, doe not onely diſpleaſe,
but doe an injury, and oftentimes it
fals out, that by this meanes, hee that
is thus negligent comes to be reprehended,
and to gaine envy, eſpecially
when one Citizen, ceaſes to give ſuch
honour to another, as the uſe is to
doe, as in not putting off the hat, nor
ſpeaking civilly, in which he doth
very ill.
               For the force of cuſtome, is very
great, and in ſuch caſes, ought to
be obſerved, like a Law: and ſo he
that calleth to another by his name
being not farre better then he is, doth
undervalue him, and commits an uncivill
act in naming him, for hee
knowes that in ſuch language, men
call unto workemen, and labourers,
and although in this place heretofore,
and in other Countries, even
at this day men may uſe ſuch meane
titles, without undervaluing of any

one: yet wee muſt not diſobey the
moderne faſhion: but are bound to
obſerve it, as a Law; And therefore
it is neceſſary for us, that we diligently
learne, the actions and words,
which are at preſent in uſe, to give,
and receive, by way of ſalutation,
or ſpeaking to any, even in that Country
where wee live. And though in
the time of Don Pedro of Arragon,
the Admirall was many times called,
his Majeſty, becauſe it was the cuſtome
of that time, ſo to doe, yet
we ought not, (for all this) to call
our King on this manner: if we were
now either to ſpeake or to write unto
him. For ſuch uſe as our age obſerves,
ſuch alſo muſt we doe. And
theſe I call due ceremonies, becauſe
they proceede not from our free will,
and pleaſure, but becauſe they are
become a Law, and common cuſtome.
But if by chance they may bee left:
one ought not to be ſo ſingular, as
to oppoſe, that which is accompted
good behaviour: like ſome unpleaſing
men, that thinke, that every
one owes them reſpect, and know
not themſelves how to returne any
one a good word, and doe take pleaſure

to be taken notice of, for theſe
extremities. On the Contrary to
theſe, there are others, ſo exceſſively
abounding in good manners, that
we may ſay, they have as much too
much, as thoſe others have too little,
and they ſpend all their times, in
Compliments, to ſhew their good
breeding, and other like impertinencies.
And they dwell ſo long upon
things, (which in themſelves are nothing)
to make them pleaſing to others,
that it becomes troubleſome,
theſe are made of meere ceremonies,
ſpeaking after this manner. Your honour
hath ſhewed me ſo much favour,
that, I hould my ſelfe moſt obliged
to ſerve you, as long as I live.
If God pleaſe to grant me time for it,
I ſhall bee moſt prodigall, to ſpend
it in your honours ſervice, and ſuch
like ſtuffe as this. A certaine Biſhops
Chaplaine, did purpoſely uſe ſuch
returning of thankes, as theſe: the
Biſhop his maſter, having beſtowed
certaine benefices, and penſions, upon
certaine of his ſervants: to this
Chaplaine though he had ſerved him
long time, he gave the leaſt benefice:
not being worth above eighty Ducates

a yeare and that will cure. But
when the reſt were to give thankes
for their penſions, and rewards, ſome
to the value of five hundred Duckats,
others to the value of three hundred,
and ſome to the value of foure hundred
Duckats: it fell out, that hee
that had that but of eighty Duckats,
gave the greateſt thankes, ſhewing
greater content then all the reſt, at
which the Biſhop (marvailing ſomewhat)
asked him why he gave the
largeſt thankes, this reward which
he had beſtowed upon him, being
the leaſt, and of ſo little value. Hee
anſwered, that he eſteemed it more
then if hee had given him one of a
thouſand Duckates, it being ſo ſutable
to his neceſſities: he being (as
he was by nature, ſo cholerick, that
no maſter could beare with him; nor
indeed was there any ſervant that he
could beare withall, and ſo that
living not being enough to keepe a
boy, and too much for him to remaine
with his Lordſhip (it being
with cure of ſoules) therefore he gave
him ſo great thankes, for both freeing
him from a maſter, and alſo from a
man. I ſay therefore ſome uſe too

many, and ſome too few ceremonies.
            
            
               Of kiſſing the handes.
               1. And although kiſſing in ſigne
of reverence, is moſt properly uſed
amongſt us, in holy things, as the
kiſſing of reliques, and dead mens
bones, yet in our Country alſo, We
have a cuſtome, to ſay, I kiſſe your
honours hands: I beſeech your honour,
to accompt mee for your ſervant;
and though we ſhun to ſpeake
it uſually, yet in ſaluting, and taking
leave, and in our Letters, and Epiſtles,
that we write, wee muſt uſe it, and
it being growne a cuſtome, we ought
not to tie our ſelves to the old way,
nor to wonder at it, like ſome inconſiderate,
and weake men, that
ſpeake in this manner, doe you ſee,
who I muſt call my Lord, And what
Lord is he I pray? perchance it is
the Curate of the Pariſh, that I am
thus bound to give the Beſar las manos
unto, &amp;c.
               But it is manifeſt, that another,
that is not uſed to ſay my Lord, nor
to be called ſo, may thinke that thou
doſt it, to affront, or diſgrace him:

and when thy eſtate, and quality is
not much above anothers, thou ſhalt
doe ill, if in acting a Cavallero, and
a Lord, thou ſhalt labour to be vaineglorious,
in undervaluing him, skruing
thankes from him by farre fetcht
ſpeeches, ſaying, my Lord, ſuch an
one, will doe this very well: and
ſome there are that will goe farther,
making their voyce to bee heard:
and confident to gaine it, if they
can make it paſſe, like a guilded Pill,
with ſuch words as theſe; my Lord
doe this for love of mee, and ſometimes
with a feigned laughter, and
giving them a clap on the ſhoulder,
entreat them they will ſing by turne,
ſaying by the faith of an honeſt man,
you have taken mee much, and all
theſe are but ſtratagems of vaineglory.
               2. Some alſo are ſo ſtudious in theſe
Ceremonies, that they have found
out a way, to diſtinguiſh betweene
thou, and you: and her, and ſhee,
and your worſhip, making ſixe degrees
of Courtſhip, ſo that no Nation
did ever advance ſo farre, for if
we marke it, the French make uſe of

                     •
                  os, or you, to all degrees, and qualities.

And I cannot now treate of
all that might bee ſayd from the title
of worſhipfull above ſayd, nor of
the greater titles, for this would draw
us into a great labyrinth. It ſufficeth
that though (heretofore) there were
a great deale: yet now the ordinary
ſort or common people have raiſed
it and filled it up with the titles of
the Nobility: and that with ſuch
might and combination, that the
Gentry, and Nobility, magnificoes,
and grandes, that uſed to have theſe
titles, are now robbed of them, and
baniſhed from their ancient Country,
and Nation. And ſo, the noble cavalleres,
and people of quality, ſeeing
this, have profited ſo farre, as to
advance a degree, or two higher,
then ordinary, to bee diſtinguiſhed
(eſpecially in their letters) from this
generation, that robbes them of their
titles.
               3. I will heere tell you what happened,
(to this purpoſe,) to a
Gentleman that was a Courtier, who
writing a Letter to a private man,
with the title of moſt magnificent
Lord, which was the title that belonged
to himſelfe, according to his

condition, he anſwered him, that hee
thought it no Courtſhip, to put ſuch
a title upon him. To which the
Courtyer replying, in his Letter,
he left a blanck for his Complement,
ſaying, Sir write (your ſelfe) that
Complement, in the voyd place, in
my Letter, that likes you beſt, for
which purpoſe I have ſent it blanck
unto you ſubſcribed with my Name.
               4. There are ſome others that to
ſhew themſelves humble, paint themſelves
out for fooles, and ſeeke to
ſhew ſo much extremity of good
behaviour, that you can perceive
little underſtanding in them, and
though they ſpeake many tongues,
yet are they never the wiſer, nor can
give any content with them: like one
that was newly married, that writ to
his Wife a Letter of many concepts,
and concluded, placing for his Complement,
at the foote of his Letter,
ſuch an one the meaneſt Husband of
your Ladyſhip kiſſeth your hands.
               5. Some others there are that by
meere careleſneſſe, make greater faults
in writing, and give either two
or three titles more, (whether they
be right or wrong) then is needfull,

eſpecially when they need any thing,
and call them moſt illuſtrious, moſt
renonced, &amp;c.
            
            
               Of the Title Sereniſſimo.
               This is an appellation belonging
unto Princes. Except when it is ſometime
uſed in ſport; As a Cavallere
did, who becauſe his ſonne walked
in the night, called him Sereniſſimo:
and being asked the reaſon, made
anſwer, that being ſuch a lover of
the evening dewes (which are called
in Spaniſh Sereno) there had ſo much
of this Sereno, (by this time) fallen
upon his head: that hee could not
be now called, leſſe then Sereniſſimo.
This Title of Sereniſſimo, was no leſſe
offenſive, to a certaine Citizen; whom a
Lord governour of eſtate, whō all called
Sereniſſimo, had much vexed. It fell
out, that as he was one evening talking
with ſome of his friends, concerning
the troubles, the Governour had put
him to, they bidding that he ſhould
goe out of the dew, that was falling
(which in Spaniſh they call Sereno)
becauſe it would doe him hurt, anſwered,
Sirs you ſay true, if then the

                  Sereno, will doe me hurt, what thinke
you the Sereniſſimo will doe.
               6. Returning now to our purpoſe.
I ſay, that even as the ceremonies,
which are in extremities, are to be
avoyded, ſo ought we not, (on the
contrary) ſo wholly to omit them,
that wee ſhould returne to the old
cuſtome, for it will ſhew very ill, to
doe like ſome ruſtick people, who
would have, that thoſe who write to
Kings, and great Lords, ſhould begin
in this manner, if thou and thy ſonne
bee well, it is well, I am alſo in good
health: affirming, that in ſuch manner,
the Latine Philoſophers, did begin
their Letters, which they uſually writ
from Rome.
               
               7. We muſt then know, and obſerve,
ſome inſtructions, and rules,
that we may not erre in ſuch things,
as theſe: and firſt, we muſt conſider
the Country wherein wee live: for
every cuſtome, is not alike good in
every place. For wee may ſpeake in
that manner in Italy, as (perchance)
the Neapolitanes doe uſe to doe, whoſe
City is full of men of quality, and
of great eſtate, which notwithſtanding,
will not ſute well, with the

                  Luqueſes, and Florentines, who are
(for the moſt part) merchants, and
meane men, and having no Princes,
marqueſſes, nor Barons amongſt
them, and although the Venetian
Gentlemen, uſe much curteſy, one to
another, and flatter one another, by
reaſon of their offices, yet will it not
ſhew well that the common people
of Ro
                        •
                     igo, and the Citizens of Aſſoli
ſhould obſerve this ſolemnity, to
give ſuch reſpect one to another, upon
all occaſions. For this is the cuſtome
of the Seigniory of Venice: and
every one doth in concluſion, of his
owne accord, follow the ſteps of
his Lord, and ancient Country, although
he knoweth no reaſon wherefore.
               We ought alſo in Spaine, no leſſe
to conſider of this ſolemnity, yet
with this caution, that amongſt the
common people, and poore places,
that conſiſt moſt of labouring people,
it is not fit to obſerve the ſame ſtyle,
in our ceremonies, which is uſed in
the great aſſemblies, eſpecially in the
Kings Palace, which would bee to
ſtrike the people with admiration.
As they report of a Lord of quality,

of this Kingdome, that held it for a
cuſtome, when he called for drinke,
if it were in the night, that five or
ſix of his ſervants, ſhould march before
the Cup, with two lighted
Torches; But as he did this in a poore
village, a man that was but ſimple,
that was there, when hee ſaw them
come towards him, bareheaded, and
with ſuch ceremony, he fell downe
on his Knees and began to adore the
Cup, beating upon his breaſt, with
great devotion. The Lord and they
that were with him, bid him riſe, And
asked him why he did ſuch reverence,
who anſwered: that ſeeing them (ſo
ſolemnly) performe this ceremony,
hee could not but kneele downe, ſuppoſing,
that they brought the holy
Sacrament, or at leaſt ſome ſacred
reliques, and ſo the Lord was warned,
by another mans ignorance, no
more to uſe this ceremony, amongſt
ſuch ordinary people.
               8. Moreover, we ought (as well)
to regard the time, as alſo the age,
and condition, of the perſon, to
whom we uſe theſe ceremonies: as
well as to conſider the place, as alſo
to conſider our owne age, and condition.

And with poore and meane
qualitied people, to be very briefe in
our expreſſions, or at the leaſt to contract
them ſomewhat and not to expreſſe
them to the full, which is well
done in the Court of Rome. But in
ſome other places they are accompted
very tedious, eſpecially to thoſe
that have much buſineſſe, who waſt
much time in them. Bee covered ſir
ſaith the Judge, that is much perplexed,
and is ſcanted of time, to diſpatch
his many buſineſſes. And hee
makes anſwer to him, that ſpeakes
to him, (after all his cringes, and
ſcrapes,) (with much gravity) in
this manner, my Lord I was very
well before. And the other addreſſing
himſelfe, to preſſe the Judge, that is
all this time was covered wreathing
his body, firſt on one ſide, then on
the other, and crowching even to
the ground, with much vanity, and
oſtentation, makes this anſwer. I beſeech
you permit me, thus to doe my
duty to you, for I am obliged unto
it, and this combate laſtes ſo long,
and ſo much of the ſtock of time is
waſted, that there is ſcarce left any
time for buſineſſe. So that thoſe that

viſit Judges, and Miniſters of publick
offices, that are intangled in government,
ſhould uſe brevity, cutting
off all Compliments, and Ceremonies,
eſpecially if they be Lords,
or perſons of quality, to whom we
cannot ſpeake ſo freely, as to others,
who are at leaſure and voyd of buſineſſe.
But it often falls out, that
poore ſuiters, muſt long wait their
turnes, before their buſineſſes can be
heard, waiting at diſtance, numbring
the words ſpoken, and with
a deſire they may be ſeene, ſtand obſerving
the impertinencies, and meane
while curſing them a thouſand times,
for anger to ſee how they ſpend the
time, and make them looſe their
meetings; and ſo are forced to returne
home, diſconſlate, and with
loſſe of their labours. And ſome there
are ſo dull, and ſo incircumſpect,
that they cannot perceive the ſignes,
that they might take notice of in ſuch
officers, whom they thus keepe from
buſineſſe, that they are troubleſome
to them: as in obſerving, how careleſſely
they anſwer their queſtions,
and that they make no apologies to
them, or give them that applauſe,

which they would give them, if they
did much reliſh them, or were at leaſure.
And if (perchance) they tell
them, that they muſt give them leave
to finiſh their buſineſſes in hand,
(Though they ſpeake this to them,
very civily, and plainlly) they goe
from them grumbling, ſaying that
they are growne proud of their offices,
and have buried all friendſhip,
and doe ſhew themſelves, to be harſh
and ill conditioned men.
               9. Nor doe ſuch ceremonies, be fit
young men, which old and grave
men may uſe: nor muſt meane, and
poore people, uſe ſuch ceremonies,
one to another, as Lords, and people
of great quality, doe uſe. And therefore,
vertuous, and well bred perſons,
doe ſtrive to avoyd them, as
(much as may be,) as being diſtaſtfull:
for ſpending all their time, and
ſtudies in ſuch vanities. Neither ought
officers, of mechanick offices, or
perſons of meane condition, to uſe
ſolemne ceremonies, with Lords,
and people of great quality: but ought
to approach to, and anſwer with
humility, and plaineneſſe, unto that,
wherein the Lord hath occaſion to

uſe them in, for there ſeemes more
obedience then honour to be required
from ſuch mens hands. And therefore,
that ſervant was in an errour,
that offered his ſervice to his Lord,
when as it was his duty, to bee alwayes
ready, at his command, nor
is it fitting, when a Lord ſtands bareheaded,
for thee to bid him bee covered:
nor if he be ſtanding or walking,
within dores, is it fit for thee
to bee ſo bould, as to goe abroad or
to ſit downe, although hee bid thee:
if thou bee of a meaner condition,
then he. But when a great Lord, is
pleaſed to ſet thee above him, to doe
thee honour, thou muſt not bee ſo
bould, to refuſe the favour he doth
thee.
               10. Now I ſay, that amongſt perſons
of equall ranke or who are but
a little diſtinguiſhed, in their perſons,
or places: this manner of good compliment,
and good cariage, may be
uſed more freely, becauſe, (oftentimes)
that which wee doe to performe
our duty, is received as due and
little honour is of us given unto him
that deſerves it, therefore he that doth
a little exceed in that which he istyed

to doe, ſeemes to beſtow a guiſt more
then can be challenged, and doth gaine
love thereby and is accounted freeminded
and liberall. And ſo was a certaine
grave Greciā
                   wont to ſay, that he
that knowes, how to converſe with, &amp;
to endeere great men, drives a great
trade: and therefore thoſe that are
pleaſed in Courtſhip, doe (at this
day) uſe thus to ſpeake. My Lord
ſuch an one, when he ſpeakes to his
friends, that are better then himſelfe,
but eſpecially when they talke with
Ladies, that are married, or with
the Daughters of their equalls, they
will ſay my Lady, and this way make
they themſelves acceptable, and gaine
the good will of all.
               11. Thou muſt then uſe ceremonies,
as a good Tayler doth his cloath,
which he cuts out to make garments
that makes them rather too long and
too large, then too ſhort, and ſcanty,
but he makes them not ſo bigge, that
in cutting out a paire of Breeches,
you may miſtake them for a Sack, or
a Cloake-bag. And if thou ſhalt uſe
a little tolerable largeneſſe in thy ceremonies,
towards them that are ſomewhat
meaner then thy ſelf, thou mayſt

bee accompted courteous, but much
more, if the perſon be ſomewhat
better then thy ſelfe, thou ſhalt bee
held for a well faſhioned and pleaſing
Gentleman. But he that ſhall extend
them in an unreaſonable ſort, ſhall
but make ſport with them, and be accompted
for a vaine fellow: and this
is the manner of ceremony which we
formerly ſpake of, which proceeds
from our owne will, and not from
cuſtome, but naturally we may paſſe
our lives without ceremonies, and in
them we may plainely ſee, that all
that is not in uſe, is ſuperfluous, and
of thoſe which are received by cuſtome,
wee may ſay, that they are
lawfull jeſtes or lyes, and wee may
alſo call them vanities, and to noble
mindes, that are not pleaſed with
ſuch arrant vanities, it is an odious,
and unpleaſing thing, to deale in
them. Therefore great ones ought to
bee more honoured, by their owne
workes, then by an others words.
               12. It is ſtoryed to this purpoſe, that
a certaine King, called Edipo, being
baniſhed his Country, put himſelfe
under the protection, of King Theoſio
in Athens, to free himſelfe from the

fury, of his perſecuting enemies: and
being brought before Theoſio, hee
heard a young daughter of his ſpeake,
who knowing her by her voyce only,
(hee being blinde for age) did not
addreſſe himſelfe to ſalute Theoſio, but
overcome with the affection of a Father,
went preſently to make much
of his daughter, and having a little
remayned ſo doing, hee beſought
Theoſio to excuſe him, and beſought
his pardon for his neglect. The good,
and wiſe King, forbare not to anſwer
him, but ſayd unto him, be of
good cheere, Edipo, for I honour
not my life, with other mens words,
but with mine owne actions. A ſaying
befitting a wiſe man, and one,
that eſteemed not fawning, and flattery.
Wherefore the flatterer ſhewes
plainely, that he that is pleaſed with
his flattery, is vaine, and arrogant,
ſimple, and of little underſtanding,
by ſuffering himſelfe to be overcome,
&amp; vanquiſhed by ſo light a thing. And
vaine and ſuperfluous ceremonies, are
plaine and knowne flatteries, ſo that
they that ſpeake, and uſe them, for
profits ſake (beſides that they be ſo
bad in themſelves, having their Foundations

in falſe, and forged words)
they remaine troubleſome, and diſtaſtfull,
for being ſo oppoſite to all
truth.
               13. There are others, beſides theſe,
which alſo conſiſt in fayned actions,
and meere apparances, ſo that whatſoever
they make aparent to you, is
a lie, and although their adorning
ſeeme naturall, yet in it ſelfe it is not
ſo, but onely to delude the ſight: as
thoſe that being leane make themſelves
ſeeme fat, and being low, to
ſeeme very tall. This is the fault we
now ſee, for the moſt part to bee in
women, who doe, if not all, yet the
moſt of them thus diſſemble. This
made a Traveller ſay, that in Spaine
(almoſt) all the women, were tall,
faire, and ruddy, either by nature,
or by art. Some others have ſayd,
that the Spaniard lay all their
grounds, or principles, in bare
Compliments, and apparances.
Therefore, if (by chance) they give
thee, a faire good complexioned,
and well proportioned wife, yet will
ſhee prove no more then halfe a
Wife and without any hayre, ſo
that at the wedding night, it may be

perceived, that halfe of her was made
of guilded corke, and though they put
her into the bed, yet the other part
of the woman which is without the
ſheetes will be found in the morning
tawny, yellow, bald, and ill complexioned,
and ſo is hee thus coſened
in halfe of his Wife. But they will
ſay, ſhee was ſeene, as ſhee was,
and that ſhee hath found her ſelfe deceived,
having diſcovered, far more
defects in her Husband, then was in
her ſelfe: that he was farre leſſe, and
black, then ſhee tooke him for. As I
have heard tell of one ſuch as theſe
who having married her ſelfe for
advancement and for coveteouſneſſe
of her Husbands wealth, obſerved,
when her Husband went to bed, that
hee pulled off a counterfet Noſe hee
wore, and a glove wherewith hee
faſtened on an artificiall hand, and
laſt of all, putting his hand to his
mouth, pulled out thence a ſet of
artificiall Teeth, and ſo in this
paſtime, of her diſorderly coveteouſneſſe,
both the lovers remayned
diſcontented.
               14. But to returne to our purpoſe,
there is yet another ſort of ceremonious

people, that make an Art,
and trade of it, and keepe a Booke
of accompt of their ceremonies namely
when you ſpeake to ſuch manner
of perſons, how your Complement
muſt be paſſed, or your ground traverſed,
with a little cloſing of the
eyes, and the head a little caſt down;
And when you ſpeake to ſuch an one,
you muſt ſpeake ſmilingly, a little
alſo bowing your head, And how
theſe of greateſt quality, muſt bee
placed, in a Chayre with Armes,
and he that is of a little meaner rank,
in plaine back-chayre, and inferiors
upon a bench, although it bee true,
that ſuch a punctuall diſtinction, of
giving honour as this, is accompted
very offenſive, and therefore, none
ought to be Judge, to determine, who
is more and who leſſe noble then another.
               15. As little fitting is it, that ceremonies,
or endeerements, bee ſold
to any to pay with them the debts
we owe unto them, as ſome Lords
doe with their ſervants, or inferiours
to whom they owe mony, whom
they pay with ceremonies, giving
them leave to ſtand covered before

then, paying them the wages they
owe them, with familiarity, and favour.
By this we may well preſume,
that thoſe who take pleaſure, in uſing
theſe outward ceremonies, doe
it for pompe, and vanity, if they exceed
the common uſe, and manner
uſed in them.
               16. There are others alſo that are
ſo fruitleſly ceremonious, that without
ſpeaking any thing of ſubſtance,
doe never leave talking, and that very
idlely, and yet with much Courtſhip,
and ſo much, that it is an obligation,
for them to excuſe you from hearing
them, of theſe ſpake hee that
ſummed up the life of Mithridato the
Court babler in theſe verſes.
               
                  That day hees placed by your ſide,
                  He makes you melt with ſcorching heate
                  Of the ſharpe torment you abide,
                  In hearing of his cariage neate.
               
               17. Theſe then, place all their diligence,
and thought, to order their
clappering tongues, and tediouſneſſe
of ſuch their impertinencies:
hammering the people, (as it were)
with their words: with which by reaſon

of their education they can make
a reaſonable ſhew or flouriſh; But in
grave matters, or things of moment,
they can ſhew no wit: and they labour
that all their converſe be ſpent,
in outward apparances. And if
any diſcourſe of good judgement
bee moved, they nor reliſh, nor underſtand
it. And of theſe impertinent
men, there are an infinite number,
that at firſt ſight deceive men, and
at the ſecond doe tire them, for then is
their ſillineſſe diſcovered.
               18. One of theſe Mitridatos was uſhering
a Lady, and being to goe through
a narrow paſſage, hee ſtood urging
her, that ſhee would goe firſt, thinking
it to bee good manners for him ſo
to doe. The Lady made a ſtop, deſiring
him to goe firſt, becauſe it was
his place, who a while refuſed it, but
at laſt he went on: ſaying, I had rather
bee thought ignorant then to
be too troubleſome. To whom the
Lady readily retorted thus: goe Sir,
for both wayes you may rightly
challenge the firſt place, and ſo ſhee
anſwered him as hee well deſerved.
               19. And to conclude this matter of

ceremonies, I ſay there are ſome others,
that are alwayes full of complementall
words, and courteous
deeds, thereby to ſupply the defect
of their ſmall meanes, ſuppoſing, that
becauſe there is little ſubſtance or
profit in their deeds, (if they ſhould
alſo want words and compliments)
no body would ever endure them,
by reaſon whereof, they ſo much exceede
in ſuperfluous ceremonies, that
(generally) they weary thoſe that
have good judgements: but for all
this, every one deſires to live, according
to his owne pleaſure, namely
with liberty; which is more eſteemed
of, then any other thing whatſoever.
            
         
         
            CHAPTER. 10. Of affected words, That in our common
talke, we ought not to uſe Latine,
or other words of another tongue.
            1. AFfectation, and extremes
ought to bee avoyded, in our
cariage, and ceremonies, and
much more, in our words: and eſpecially

ought every one, to beware, of
mixing Latine, or other ſtrange
words, in our diſcourſe, though they
bee not Latine, to thoſe that underſtand
them not, into this errour doe
they much fall into that having a little
ſtudyed the Grammar, thruſt
Latine words, into all their diſcourſes,
but ſo improperly, that they diſagree
much from the propriety of
our Caſtilian Language, and they
ſound ſo ill, that there are none doth
reſpect them: and men of good judgments
doe but laugh at them, and
make but a paſtime thereof. One being
in company with many others,
asked this queſtion of one of them,
did you (Sir) obſerve the laſt Eclipſe,
me thought it continued long (uſing
the Latine word Mora, for continuance,
or tarrying: which in the
Spaniſh tongue ſignifyes, a Mulbery)
The other in way of merriment anſwered
him in the ſame manner. I
obſerved no Mora meaning the Mulbery,
for by applying this medicine
they uſe to cure Adahalas of his headach.
            2. Much like to this, I have known
ſome uſe ſolemnly ſome words,

ſpoken (as they thought) very elegantly,
which did onely ſatisfy
thoſe that uſed them, but the hearers
of them doe but jeere and make a
ſport at them,
            
               Of thoſe who inſteed of ſpeaking elegantly
doe ſpeake nonſenſe.
               To this purpoſe a certaine beneficed
man, in a Village, that tooke upon
him to be very elegant, inviting to
dinner to him two ſtudents of his acquaintance,
which at that time were
paſſing by, ſpoke to them in this
manner, Gentlemen, it were good
that for the preſent wee Decapitate
Choller. For I greatly deſire a ſcindill
with ſo good ſociety. To whom,
one of them anſwered; beneficed Sir,
you have in conceipt ſpoken very elegantly,
and with this anſwer hee
was much pleaſed, and ſatisfyed for
his eloquence.
               3. Like to this, I will tell you heere
a jeſt (that fell out in Alcala) of a
certaine Doctor, And though ſome
ſay, to excuſe him, it was ſpoken of
him but in jeſt and mirth (as we uſe
to doe) yet it is true it ſo befell him.

And thus it was, As he ſtood looking
upon a Map of the World, which
was drawne in a great round figure,
A Nurſe that dwelt with him, came
to him, and ſayd, good Sir what is
that, that is ſo round? He anſwered
her, ſiſter, you muſt know, that it
is the Orbe, which is alſo called tho
Planiſphere, the card of the World,
or the Globe. If you underſtand none
of theſe termes, then know that it
is the whole World. But ſhee with
more curioſity, being much aſtoniſhed,
that ſhee had ſeene the whole
World, asked him, but good Sir,
where is the place where I now
ſtand? The Doctor anſwered, heere
you ſee it incluſively: if not, behold it
heere intenſively, what cannot be expreſſed
extenſively, and to conclude,
you may ſee it heere vertually, and ſo
the Nurſe was as wiſe as before, and
the Doctor as ignorant to expreſſe
his meaning, in the Caſtilian Language.
               4. Hee was alſo a bould Rethoritian,
who when he ſhould have ſayd,
I cannot inlarge my ſelfe: becauſe
I want inke; ſayd, I end becauſe
my horny veſſell furniſheth not my

Gooſe-quill, with Ethiopian liquour:
True it is, that this mingling of Latin
words, is wont to be (ſometimes,)
for neceſſity ſake, As it fell out to
a Spaniard whom I knew, who by
remayning in Flaunders from a youth
in the Univerſity of Lovaine, and
living there till he was old, and not
being able neither to ſpeake good
Latine, nor good Caſtilian, nor
Greeke, nor good French, did one
day amongſt many other pleaſing
medlyes, which he ſpake, inſteed of
ſaying, No veys La gente de guerra
come viene aſſentar ſu real entre las
matas de los Eſcobares, Sayd in this
manner, Ola no veys los Armigeros y
Catafractos como ſe vienen a caſtramentar
entre las miricas. Therefore
wee muſt take great heed that when
wee ſpeake Caſtilian, wee doe not
ſpeake Latine, as a Monk who inſteed
of ſaying, that they ſhould make
him a Picture of S. Peter, repenting,
for denying his maſter: ſayd thus, Sir
ſuch a one I entreate you, that you
paint me a very good Flevit Amare
which is in Engliſh, he wept bitterly.
As ill ſhewes it, on the contrary,
if when we are to ſpeake Latine, we

mixe Caſtilian, as a maſſe Prieſt did,
in certaine Prayers, who when hee
was to goe out ſinging in Latine
Ecce lumen Chriſti (in Engliſh, behould
the light of Chriſt) were it
that hee could not hit on it in Latine,
or hee had forgotten what to ſay,
went forth, holding the Candle
aloft, and ſinging, behold this burning
Taper, in Spaniſh y Aqui el
cirio encendido. Let theſe few examples
admoniſh us, to avoyd improper,
and affected words, which are not
ſutable, to the matter in hand, alwayes
conſidering the time, place,
and occaſion, and thoſe that heare us,
that wee may not erre, nor give them
occaſion, to ſay any thing againſt
us.
            
         
         
            CHAPTER 11. Of Amplifications.
            1. NOe leſſe then affectations are
wont to bee ill taken, are
Amplifications ill accepted of and
hard to gaine credit, and in our common
diſcourſe, ought to be omitted,

and left to Poets, &amp; makers of Fables.
There are ſome, that doe ſo amplify,
and enlarge themſelves, in their
words and dealings, that they are
accompted happy who are in favour
with them, for they will extoll them
to the Clouds, as in like manner,
thoſe that are out of favour with
them, ſhall be extremely vilifyed by
their tongues. And ſo, they runne altogether
in extremes, with great
hazard of their owne credits, as you
may perceive, when I have told you,
what I my ſelfe have heard from one
of them, at a certaine meeting:
where dilating upon the beauty of a
Lady there, hee ſayd that ſhee was
ſo wonderfull faire, that not to diſparage
the other beauties of the Nation,
they were not worthy of her
preſence, or company, nor to live
in the ſame ſtreete, ſhee dwelt in;
And that her confeſſor, had charged
her, to goe to maſſe either very early
in the morning, or elſe cloſe vailed,
that ſhee might not diſcompoſe the
people, with her preſence. And a
Painter that was to draw her Picture,
did confeſſe, and report, that her
beauty was ſo admirable, that hee

was in deſpaire ever to be able to repreſent
any likeneſſe or ſhadow of it.
Such as theſe doe tranſport the
people with their enlargements, but
they uſually receive this pay for their
paines, that be the thing as faire as it
will that they magnify, it ſeemes
not ſo (when it is ſeene) as they have
ſet it forth to be, and they are accompted
for buſy men, and of little
worth.
            
               That wee ought as little to ſpeake ill of
any, nor ought our jeſting, and jeeres
to bee biting.
               2. We muſt as little (in our converſation)
ſpeake ill of any, nor of
his family, (Though we thinke that
thoſe that heare us, are pleaſed therewith,
and are willing to harken to
us.) which vice uſually happens, by
meanes of the envy which (for the
moſt part,) we beare, to one anothers
wealth, and honour, but at laſt
let every one beware of the kicking
Horſe. And therefore underſtanding
perſons doe flye from ill tongues, conſidering,
that they that will tell us
ſuch things, of others, will tell others

as much of us: and as it is ſayd,
flye from him, that reporteth ſuch
novelties, for he is the man that invented
them; and thoſe that oppoſe
contradict, and withſtand all manner
of diſcourſe they meete with,
give a teſtimony that they doe not
well underſtand the nature of men,
and that every one loves to conquer,
and hates to be overcome, no leſſe in
words then in workes: how much
more for one man (voluntarily) to
oppoſe and contradict another, is it
accompted a worke of envy, and not
of friendſhip? Therefore he that deſires
to be pleaſing in his cariage, and
converſe: ought not to be ſo armed
alwayes in his diſcourſe as to ſay,
this you ſayd was not ſo: but as I
tell it you: nor ought wee to lay
wagers of it, but in triviall things,
we ought to bend our ſelves, to incline
to other mens opinions, for the
victory in ſuch things proves but our
loſſe: for it is very true, that by gayning
the Conqueſt, in a frivolous
queſtion, and a matter of noe value,
we oftentimes diſpleaſe a deere friend.
            
            
               Of domineerers and confident people.
               And theſe Domineerers are

ſo offenſive to all people, that they
dare not converſe with them: for
feare of falling every houre into
wranglings, without profit, even to
be at daggers drawing; But if (at any
time) it fall out, that any bee drawn
on to diſpute, hee muſt doe it in a
mild faſhion, and muſt not laſh out
with delight to overcome: or ſeeke
to order all the matter, and to have
all the honour, attributed to himſelfe:
but hee muſt leave every body
his ſhare: and in contending whether
it bee reaſon, or not, that every
one alledgeth, he muſt leave it to the
judgment of the moſt, and if there
ſhall bee any exceſſively confident:
let him leave the matter to them, quitting
the plaine field, for them to contend,
to ſweate and toyle themſelves.
For theſe are manners hatefull to
men that are modeſt and of good
behaviour. Beſides this, wee cannot
get the victory without hatred, and
envy; And becauſe for the moſt part
all people by nature, ſeeke to attribute
glory to themſelves, and doe undervalue
and diſpraiſe other mens opinions,
that they may every one ſhew
himſelfe wiſe, valiant and of much

underſtāding, therfore it falls out that
many doe adviſe, reprehend, diſpute,
and defend themſelves, with Rapier,
and Poniard, as they ſay, againſt all
men, and will incline themſelves to
no mans opinion, but ſtand to their
owne: and are ſo blind, and obſtinate
in their owne way, that no reaſon
is forcible enough, to alter them
from it: and though theſe doe not
finde fault with the opinion of their
friends, yet will they not leave their
owne errors.
            
            
               Fortune-tellers.
               3. There are others, that if you fall
into diſcourſe with them, at that
time when you come into their company
to refreſh your ſelfe, from your
labours, can never get out from ſome
lamentable diſcourſe, and misfortunes,
and ill preſages, that threaten
the people, for the time to come:
and when they heare of any victory,
or good ſucceſſe, they ſpoile all, with
the love they beare to ill omens, and
their owne only opinions, which doe
with meere phanſy, and vaine glory,
make themſelves melancholy. Suppoſing

by this their unſavory humor,
the more to give credit, to their fooliſh
condition; and ſome, to whom,
and their yeares reſt, and quiet is
due, yet doe nothing but talke lamentably,
never altering their diſcourſe,
ſaying that in their dayes, the
men were more valiant, and not as
they are now, that there is not a
man left worth a Button, and the
like.
               4. It is alſo blame worthy, and
that with great reaſon, for any, that
is in company with others, to whiſper;
ſo that all cannot heare what he
ſayth, but eſpecially for two, or
three, to ſeparate themſelves, from
the reſt, and to ſtand laughing, and
looking upon the reſt, or to deſire
to be covered, or muffled when the
reſt are not, for this is after a ſort a
betraying of him of whom we ſpeake,
and in all reaſon they muſt offend
many, that uſe it: eſpecially any
one that is ſuſpicious or jealous.
               There are others, of ſuch a condition,
that if they bee not talking,
they ſtand in ſuch a ſtudy, that never
regarding what they doe, they have
their eyes fixed upon another, laughing

at their owne phanſyes, and never
thinking of him they looke upon,
and thence muſt neceſſarily ariſe ſuſpition,
as an Author ſaith.
               
                  If any looke me in the face,
                  Yet mindes ſome other thing▪
                  
                  He ſeemes in giving that the place,
                  Me with contempt to ſting.
               
               5. They muſt then be admoniſhed
that are in publique, and in company,
that they be not ſo careleſſe, that they
ſtand with fixed eyes, on any ſide, and
be wholly taken up with their owne
thoughts.
               6. Nor is it fit, that when wee are
in ſuch company, wee ſhould draw
out a booke, or to ſettle our ſelves to
reade to our ſelves to paſſe away the
time, though we take as much pleaſure
in reading, as one Collegiall
Trilingue of Alcala did, That did verify
he tooke ſo much pleaſure in reading
of Martiall, that being deſired
to goe to Gadalajaca (foure leagues
off) he put on his Gowne he uſed to
weare in his Houſe, and bid them
ſaddle Martiall for him, and with
that he went, reading ſtep by ſtep, never

thinking on the weariſomneſſe of
the way.
            
            
               Of thoſe that are alwayes giving counſell.
               7. Thou mayſt not offer thy adviſe
to him, that requires it not, for that

                     •
                  s nothing elſe, but to ſhew thy ſelfe
wiſer then him to whom thou giveſt
thy adviſe, and to caſt his little underſtanding
in his teeth; and to accompt
him for an ignorant man,
therefore no acquaintance may enboulden
thee to doe this to another,
except they be alſo our very intimate
friends, or bee ſuch, that wee have
the tuition of or that we doe ſee them
in any apparant danger, whom wee
thus counſell or give adviſe unto.
But in our ordinary dealing, a man
ought to abſtaine from counſelling
much. Into which error many doe
fall, but more often, thoſe that know
little themſelves, for to men of groſſe
underſtandings, few things come into
their heades, that others have
neede of. And (certainely) there
are ſome, that ſo much eſteeme of
their owne knowledge, that if others

doe not follow their opinion, they
are offended, and complaine of thoſe
that refuſe it, as if they ſhould ſay.
It is well, a poore mans adviſe cannot
be admitted, ſuch an one, will
doe as hee liſteth, and will not heare
me: and other things of this nature,
and to this tune. As if pretending
another ought to obey thy counſell,
were not a greater arrogancy,
then for thee to follow thine owne
minde.
               8. A like fault are they guilty of,
that finde fault with other mens imperfections,
giving a definitive ſentence,
touching every thing; and
preſcribing Rules, and Lawes, to every
one, whoſoever hee bee. This
ought not to bee, as for example, to
ſpeake thus, You ſpake ſo, but it was
not well ſpoken, take heede of ſleeping
at ſuch an houre: the Wine you
drunke is not good for you, you
ſhould drinke Claret, you ſhould uſe
ſuch a kinde of bath, and not ſuch
as you doe: and thus are they alwayes
reproving, and are like thoſe
that are alwayes weeding another
mans Garden, and never conſider,
that their owne is overgrowne with

Nettles, and Brambles: and therefore
we ſhould leave this worke, to Fathers
and Maſters.
            
            
               Of contemning others.
               9. Wee ought not to deſpiſe any
body, nor to ſet light by him, though
he be our enemy, for it is a greater
ſigne of diſgrace, to deride one, then to
doe him a ſhrewd turne, for of him that
we doe an injury to, wee make ſome
reckoning: but him that we deſpiſe
we make far leſſe eſteeme of, yea often
none at all, therefore to ſcorne, or
deride, is a pleaſure we take to ſhame
another, without any profit at all
to our ſelves. And therefore in our
common converſe, and dealings with
men, thoſe that would bee curious,
ought to forbeare, to flout any body:
and therefore they doe ill, that are
ever ſifting out, and retorting other
mens defects upon them, (although
they have ſuch faults) for this is not a
good way, to rid them of them, and
underſtanding and well faſhioned
perſons, doe avoyd ſuch a reprocher
as they would the Divell: but
there are ſome, that when they

cannot give ill language will grumble,
and inveigh aganiſt the defects of others,
by often ſmiling, and other
exteriour acts: and ſometimes, they
make jeſts, and ſolace themſelves and
make ſport with the imperfections
and miſeries of others, whereas they
ſhould rather mourne, and grieve for
them. It may well be, (as a certaine
Courtier was wont to ſay) that the
ſharpeneſſe of the tongue, may reliſh
well, and pleaſe the appetite much, in
mēs acceptance therof, yet this tartnes
muſt not be done to endanger or much
diſturbe the ſweete love, and friendſhip,
which is mainteyned without
any hazard on either ſide: So then the
jeere which any receaves from thee
muſt be light, that hee who receaves it
may without ſhame be excuſed. And
although theſe jeeres and quips of
wit bee but a laughing, and jeſting
at the faults, and overſights of him
that receives them, yet for all this,
they are eſteemed, and liked in him
that knows how to ſpeake them, well,
becauſe we know his intention to bee
very farre from wronging of any
therby. And therefore without doubt,
thoſe that can talke merrily, yet in

a friendly manner, and without prejudice:
are better liked then thoſe
that know not how to doe it, and
are received with open Armes, and
eſteemed, and regarded of all men. As
on the contrary they are ill thought
of, that ſeeke to follow this vaine
without all diſcretion, not obſerving
any Rules or good manners
therein, and therefore, hee that will
doe this, muſt bee a very able man,
for he muſt take many things into his
conſideration. But in effect (as I
have ſayd) this jeering is but to make
ſport with the defects, and errors
of thoſe that we ought to love and
reſpect.
            
            
               Of thoſe that take offence at words.
               10. On the other ſide, jeſts can
hardly be diſtinguiſhed, from wrongs,
eſpecially by ſome perſons, who are
ſo captious, that they take all jeſts,
and quips, for affronts, and are ſo
unſavory, and ſo voyd of underſtanding,
that inſteed of being pleaſed, or
delighted therewith, they grow into
choller, ſo that none can jeſt or meddle
with them: And there are ſome, that

ſuppoſe you ſhould beare with their
neceſſities and troubleſomeneſſe, and
if you ſay any thing to them, how
ſlight ſo ever it bee: they are of ſuch
a diſpoſition, that they are preſently
off of the hookes, and are ſo offenſively
diſquiet, that although they
are (ſometimes) quickly appeaſed,
yet during that ſmall time, that their
fooliſh anger doth laſt, they may infect
others, with ſuch an humour,
that may bee their deſtruction. But
what will it bee, if they bee headſtrong,
and that their diſpleaſure doe
not depart, but that they ſleepe with
it, and they diſſemble their intentions,
and wounded minde, with
cheerfull countenances: wee can ſay
no more of theſe, but this, that (if
wee fall into merriment,) wee muſt
ſow a Hoſe about their Legges, as we
uſe to doe to Chickens, that wee may
know them a farre off. To this purpoſe
Doctor Villabos, the great Phyſitian,
as it is related in a certaine
very pleaſing Dialogue of his, having
put a jeſt upon another Phyſitian,
in the preſence of the King, hee
grew in choler, and to bee revenged
ſpake thus to the King. Your Majeſty

may underſtand, that I value my ſelfe
more, for that I am a Phiſitian, then
to be accompted a merry companion,
or a jeſter, To whom Vilabos anſwered,
Seignior Doctor makes mee to
bee very ſimple; for hee is ſo great
a maſter, that he cannot be compted
a wity companion, which anſwer
being ſo readily given, was well taken,
and the other received the pay
he deſerved. And it ſo falls out, that
hee who is jeered, but in mirth, and
in a friendly manner, doth often,
by inconſideratneſſe, take it for an
affront and a diſgrace. And although
it bee ſo, that quips and jeeres are
many times well taken, yet will not
I counſell a civill Gentleman, to addict
himſelfe much unto them. Nor
ought he to occaſion them often to be
ſpoken, nor at all times, and upon
all occaſions. For jeſtes well ſcanned,
are nothing elſe, but bould, and
ſubtile deceiptes. And therefore wee
ſhould leave the perpetuall making of
jeſts, to thoſe that live by them.
Who though they jeere never ſo much,
can prejudice none by it, but if they
doe it wittyly are to bee rewarded
for it. But when a brave Gentleman

ſpeakes any thing ſharply, hee is to
conſider that every one is offended
with him, that telleth him of his
fault or error. Therefore, for many reaſons
it ſeemes that hee that deſires to
bee well eſteemed, ſhould not make
himſelfe a maſter of jeſts, much leſſe
to eſteeme himſelfe for his ability, in
being Satyricall, and ſcandalous:
like thoſe that are full of cenſuring, although
they be very witty, and pleaſing
in it, nor let them take ſuch
jollity in it as to loſe a friend thereby.
But eſpecially it is worthy blame
to make a jeere of the naturall defects
of any one.
            
            
               That jeſts ſhould not bee ſpoken to prejudice
any body.
               Although it hath bin ſeene in this
caſe, that thoſe who ought to have
bin ſilent in a matter, and yet have
ſpoken it to another, have bin anſwered
ſharply, as it was in that
which they tell, that an one-eyed
fellow ſayd to a fellow with a Hogback,
who to call him crooke-back
ſayd thus; Companion, thou haſt
carried that burden, ever ſince the

morning, to whom he anſwered, ſurely
that hath not bin long, for it is but
very early dayes yet, for you have
opened but one of your windows, ſo
that each of them, jeered the other,
with the imperfection that nature
had marked them with. But ſatyricall
ſpeeches pierce deeper when they
touch upon our deſcent, or honor,
like that which one that was newly
converted to Chriſtianity did ſpeake
to another by a jeere, to decipher
him out, which other ſeeing the Chriſtian
being a Cavalleere, ſit very back
upon his Horſe, ſayd to him, companion,
why doe you get up ſo back
upon your Horſe buttocks? to whom
he anſwered, if I get up ſo back, it is
becauſe I would not gall him, with
the Cruz, and ſo was hee revenged on
him by jeering him for being a Iew.
And ſo ſtopped his forward boldneſſe.
Touching this matter, I ſay: that if our
acuteneſſe, and hability doe vent it
ſelfe, in ſuch prejudiciall ſayings,
it were better wee ſhould never uſe it,
for it cannot bee done with a ſafe
conſcience, but where a man may
ſpeake of things without hurt, to our
neighbour, and with diſcretion, and

judgement. It is true, that to paſſe
this troubleſome life, wee may uſe
ſome ſolace and paſtime, and that
jeſts and quips are wont to bee uſed,
as inſtruments to move laughter, and
to recreate us withall, and therefore,
they are loved, that can move mirth
and ſpeake wittily, without offending
any body, and there are very few
that know how to doe this: therefore
there are many things to bee
conſidered, that we fall not into diſfavour.
And it falls out, that that,
which uſeth to pleaſe, and gaine the
favour of ſome, may diſpleaſe, and
looſe the favour of others; And commonly
where laughter hath no place,
&amp; to be pleaſant pleaſeth not, there to
Jeſt or Jibe any body, is not acceptable,
for there is no worſe jeſt then truth.
               11. By which you may know, that
there are ſome words which bite, and
do prejudice, and there are others that
doe not. Of the firſt I ſhall not need to
ſay much: one wiſe compariſion, that
a certaine Italian Lady, called Lawreras
once ſpake ſhall ſuffice: Jeſts, ſaith
ſhe, muſt bite thoſe they are givē unto;
like a Lamb, and not like a Dogge;
for if they bite like a dog, they are not

jeſts, but villanie and wrong; and as
(by the Law) he is puniſhed that abuſeth
another in words, ſo ought hee to
be, that by his jeſts, ſpeakes bitterly
and diſgracefully of his neighbour:
for which reaſon, diſcreete and well
behaved men ought to conſider, that
the ſame Law that takes order againſt
wrongs, doth alſo take order againſt
biting jeſts; and therefore, when
men jeſt, they muſt pricke but lightly.
               12. It is likewiſe to be underſtood,
that a jeſt ſometimes biteth, and ſometimes
not, and if it be not witty and
pleaſant, there is no delight taken in it
by thoſe that heare it, but proves lukewarm,
&amp; grows cold and frozen; and if
peradvēture they laugh, it is not at the
jeſt, but at the ſillineſſe of the jeſter; and
becauſe jeſts are nothing but frauds,
and ſpoken to beguile; and as it is an
artificiall thing, ſo it cannot bee done,
but by perſons of a ſharpe wit, (eſpecially
upon a ſudden) and therefore
it ſuits ill with dull men and
thoſe that have a groſſe phanſy, except
it be, when ſpeaking by chance
in ſuch their ſimplicity, they utter
words worth laughing at, which

then takes the more, becauſe hee
breakes the jeſt naturally and unawares,
&amp; not by witty and feigned art.
As a certaine labourer did who being
asked by certaine Citizens why
hee came to them, looked ſtedfaſtly
upon one of them, that had a thick
black beard, and ſayd, I come to
ſell a Pig, with reverence to the venerable
beard of this Gentleman. But
why quoth the Citizen doe you aske
pardon of mee more then of the reſt?
hee replyed (ſimply and without
malice) becauſe your worſhips beard
is ſo thick and buſhy that it reſembles
a Hogs foote before it is ſcalded. The
ſayd Citizen could doe noe leſſe
then laugh with the reſt, for company,
though hee were ſomewhat
angry at the Jeſt. Another Biſcanoys
that was ſent for to buy a Pullet
bought a Cock, ſuppoſing hee had
done well, becauſe the Cock was
bigger then a Pullet: and of this ſort,
there are infinite Jeſts, that are meerly
naturall, and without any malice.
But all that have good wits, know not
how to Jeſt, for it is a peculiar gift,
and readineſſe of wit, that all cannot
attaine unto, therefore diſcreete

men, underſtand themſelves better,
then to thinke to doe it at their pleaſure,
but are contented, with the talent,
and diſpoſition, they are endued
withall.
            
            
               Of thoſe that make jeſts and know
not of it.
               And when ſuch men, have once or
oftener made triall of the ſtrength of
their wits in vaine: they doe finde
that they have no faculty that way,
and doe forbeare to buſy themſelves,
in exerciſing it, for it is a certaine
faculty, that few are excellent in.
Some have this property, that no word
can paſſe, but they have a jeſt, or witty
ſaying, ready to paſſe upon it. And
you muſt know, that another cannot
relate, nor put in writing the jeſts
that another invented, and uttered,
with ſuch grace, and delight as the
authors of them can, therefore. I hope
I ſhall heere bee excuſed (in part,)
if thoſe that I here ſet downe, for examples
ſake, doe not give very good
content to the Reader.
            
            
               
               Formes of Jeſts.
               13. And amongſt the ſeverall wayes of
Jeſts, there is one very good, and pleaſing,
namely to make ſport with a
word that hath divers ſignifications.
As a Cavallere, that was travelling
on the way, as hee paſſed through a
certaine Village, hee asked what
place it was, and how they, called it;
they anſwered it was called a Village,
(which in the Spaniſh tongue, is called
Caſar, which ſignifies alſo to
marry) the Cavallere anſwered, in
this Jeſt. Quien paſſa por el Caſar, por
todo puede paſſar. That is, he that can
paſſe through marriage, may paſſe all
places.
               14. A certaine ill favoured old woman,
ſaying to a Lord of quality, of
this Court, that ſhee deſired to marry,
into Baldemoro, being the name of a
Family in Spaine, hee anſwered her
thus, Madam, in all Ethiopia called
in Spaine Baldemoro, you cannot meet
with any ſo ugly that will have you.
               15. Alſo in like manner did a gentleman
of Valodolid make a Jeſt upon
two words that had two contrary

ſences, though they had the ſame Letters.
A certaine ill favored Lady had
ſpoken very diſdainefully of him, and
had reported that ſhee could not bee
perſwaded, that any women thought
well of men. Hee contrived as ſhee
came to walk on the banke of Eſgueva
which is a little ſtreame, whereinto
the people empty all their filth, to anſwer
her with this Sonnet.
               
                  In midſt of Eſgeve and the Flowers,
                  Her pudly ſtreams, Piſverga ſent
                  Where freſh, and new fruits grow all howers,
                  Two Shepheards th' ayre with ſhrill notes rent.
                  O Nimph whoſe love procures no flames,
                  Whom one ſole lover doth not woe.
                  Being commandreſſe of theſe ſtreames,
                  How can you paſſe with one or two?
                  Leeſt thou on Bridg i'th Ford, or Bote,
                  Seated among ſuch Flowers ſweete,
                  Powring cleare liquour downe thy throte,
                  Muſt needs be thought for thee unmeete.
                  That thou ſhouldſt have no ſutering ſwaines
                  That thrives by th' peoples backward gaines.
               
               16. To this purpoſe taking onely
the literall meaning, one Catedratico
                  
in Alcala, made a pleaſing interpretation
being to act a ſpeech which
was to begine in Caſtilian (as the
manner is) ſpoke the preamble in
Latine as followes, Ampliſſime rector,
graviſſimi Doctores, Nobilis iuventus:
which is as much as to ſay, moſt
bountifull Governour, moſt grave
Doctors, Noble youth: but as he began
in Latine, they gave many ſtroaks
with their Hands, and ſtampes with
their Feete, in token that hee ſhould
have ſpoken in Caſtilian, he was bould
to beſpeake them in this manner, ſaying,
my Lords, your honours may
perceive, that it ſounds not ſo well
in the Caſtilian tongue, as in the Latine,
and ſeeing they continued to
ſtampe the more, hee began in the literall
ſenſe, in this forme; magnificent
Rector, moſt grave doctours,
Noble youth, caſting his eyes upon
the Women, that ſate in the windows,
over againſt the Theater, in which
entrance, there was much pleaſure
taken, and wit, in interpreting the
ſound only, and ſo it was received for
a Jeſt and a pleaſing ſpeech.
               17. Some deſire to do this, but know
not how: but ſpeake words, that are

frozen and without ſence, which are
taken very unſavorily. As for example,
if you aske them, where ſuch an
one is, they will anſwer you, where
his feete ſtands, or betweene the Skye
and the ground. So that they ſpeake
in another manner, then was expected,
and without any ingenuity at
all, and with ſuch frivolous anſwers,
they looſe the eſteeme, of underſtanding,
and well ſpoken men. If happily
they retaine not the credit, that a
certaine poore man did (A credit of
a different and more witty ſence) who
laying a wager with others, that hee
could have credit with the bankers,
(or mony lenders) for more then
thirty thouſand Duckets, and they asking
him how it was poſſible, he being
ſo poore, and decayed a man; Hee
anſwered them thus. It is cleere my
Lords, that if I demand of any banker,
in this manner, my Lord ſuch
an one, doe you not believe that to
bee rich, and to purchaſe two thouſand
Duckets a yeare, and to have my
Houſe well furniſhed, that I have
neede of thirty thouſand Duckets, doe
you not credit what I ſay? ſurely he
will anſwer mee, I ſpeake great reaſon:

and ſo will the reſt of the bankers.
Then according to this manner
of credit, namely to bee believed of
them, I can now ſay, that I have credit
of thirty thouſand Duckets. And
in this manner hee proved his credit,
taking the word in a different
ſence.
               18. Some others there are that are
ſo ſetled in this way of Jibing, &amp; Jeſting,
that you cannot know, when they
ſpeake in earneſt, or when in Jeſt, and
by the long continuance they have
held, in ſpeaking pleaſantly, and diſguiſedly,
when they are to ſpeake
truth, they are fayne to uſe oathes, that
they may be believed. And therefore
that we be not brought to this paſſe,
our earneſt muſt bee more then our
Jeſting.
            
            
               Heavy Ieeres.
               And if thou make any Jeſts for
mirth ſake, let them not bee heavy, or
bitter ones. As to take any thing from
thy friend which may vex and trouble
him, in looking for it, and may
make him jealous of any thing or to
walke about diſcontentedly. As little
doe I hold it good, to ſtrike or

ſcratch, or pinch men, in Jeſt: for
from ſuch Jeſtings, we have ſeene men
fall to earneſt.
               20. But becauſe it is not our purpoſe,
to diſpute heere, what may bee
accompted fitting or unfitting Jeſts,
and Jeeres, nor to urge more to any
purpoſe, then what is needfull, for
the illuſtration of it: I omit many
examples, which are extant, of witty
ſayings, and ſtories to that purpoſe.
            
            
               How you may know a good jeſt.
               21. It is ſufficient to know that
jeſts doe carry with them, either a
certaine teſtimony of their pleaſantneſſe,
and decency: or of their couldneſſe
and unpleaſantneſſe. And to
know if a Jeſt be good, or bad, he cannot
bee miſtaken, that obſerves this
that folowes: And it is this, that hee
that Jeſts, be not too confident of himſelfe;
for it is plainly ſeene, that when
a Jeſt is good, and pleaſing, the company
is pleaſed at the very uttering
it, applauding it with the laughter,
and jollity they make at it: And when
it is not liked of thoſe that heare it,
he that makes it, is offended, and avoids

making any more, ſo that the
defect being in truth his owne, and
not their fault that heares it, and ſo
not being ſo approved, hee is to reſt
convinced as by a definitive ſentence,
for he cannot appeale to himſelfe.
            
            
               Of making a witty and ready anſwer.
               The knowing how to make a ready
anſwer to any queſtion, is no leſſe
requiſite, then to know how to make
a witty and pleaſant Jeſt, or to ſpeake
acutely. And ſome there are, that
are ſo ingenious, and endowed, with
ſuch a gift, that they will anſwer ſo
quick, to a queſtion, or ſo wittily
apply a pleaſant ſpeech, to thoſe that
heare them, that you would thinke
they had bin ſtudying long to bring
it forth.
               23. They report of that famous
Dantes, that ſome of his adverſaries
ſearching for him, when they could
not know him by his Face, they
ſound him out, by his ready and acute
anſwers hee made, to all queſtions
they asked of him: And ſo three
of thoſe that met with him, asked
him three queſtions together to try if

they could diſtract him, one asked
him, Dove venite? the ſecond, Dove
de laqua? and the third, Quanti ſon di
Luna? which is as much as to ſay,
whence comeſt thou? whence comes
the Water? how old is the Moone?
who anſwered them all three, in three
words, ſaying, Davilla, Aloulo, in
quinta: from the City, from the
Pitchers, five dayes old. And ſo was
he diſcovered by his quickneſſe.
            
         
         
            CHAPTER, 12. Of ſpeaking ſet ſpeeches.
            1. THere is another manner of giving
entertaynement, which
conſiſteth in Knowledge how to
ſpeake, namely, when the pleaſure
thereof conſiſteth not in Jeſts, and
witty ſayings, which are commonly
very ſhort, but in ſpeaking a continued
ſpeech, which ought to bee
done orderly, and with good expreſſions:
ſo that hee that ſhall ſpeake
knowes how properly to repreſent,
the manner and uſe, actions, and

faſhion of him hee ſpeakes of, ſo that
he that heares him ſpeake, thinkes he
even ſees acted before him, the things
which he relates unto him.
            
               To know how to ſpeake well.
               2. And this Knowledge to ſpeake
well muſt conſiſt, not in differencing
or extreme altering the voyce, nor
in imitating of actors of Playes. But
it is neceſſary for him that will ſpeake
well, to remember well the matter,
ſtory, or Hiſtory, and to have ready
and fitting words, that hee may not
ſpeake from the purpoſe, As ſome uſe
to doe, after this manner. And ſo
my Lords, as I ſayd, and to the end,
that ſuch an one, or another what
doe you call him, helpe mee pray,
to name him: tell me his name, &amp;c.
All which are ill cuſtomes, and are
offenſive to an underſtanding audience.
And if he repeate an accident,
wherein were many names, hee muſt
not ſpeake thus; ſuch a one ſayd thus,
another ſpake ſo, or ſuch a one anſwered
in this manner, for all of
them may bee ſayd to bee one or another.
And hee that heares it, may
eaſily erre, in not underſtanding of

whom he ſpeakes, and therefore, he
that relates ſuch a paſſage, muſt recite
the names preciſely, and therefore
muſt take heede he forget them not.
               3. It falls out in like manner, that
ſome are ſo careleſſe, that they forget
what they were ſpeaking of, by
ſuffering their thoughts to rome upon
other matters, ſo that they will
aske you, what were we talking of,
I have forgot what I was ſaying. This
cannot bee done, without blame to
him that was thus diſcourſing:
even as he that recites an oration or
other ſpeech, and never mindeth
what he is doing. For it ſeemes that
he that is thus forgetfull, doth little
eſteem the content of his Auditors.
               4. Beſides this, a man muſt take
heede, that hee ſpeake not ſuperfluities,
and things of no ſubſtance,
or which make nothing to the matter
in hand, As if when the auditors
are waiting for the ſucceſſe of the
ſtory, he that relates it ſhall ſpeake
thus, ſuch an one that was the ſonne
of ſuch a man, that went many times,
to ſuch a Merchants houſe, that was
married to a leane Woman, that was
called by ſuch a name, did you not

know her? how is it poſſible you
ſhould not? you had better bin ignorant
in another matter: A good old
Woman, very ſtreight, that had a very
thick hayre: and well combed, and
ſuch ſtuffe as this. For if they make
not much to the buſineſſe, it is (at beſt)
but to waſt the time, for by it, they
hinder the pleaſure, which might otherwiſe
be taken, in their diſcourſe,
and is of little benefit to them, that
liſten to them; But eſpecially if they
bee urgent, and deſirous, to know
the cloſe of the ſtory; we ought not
to puniſh them ſo much in circumloquutions,
whereas all ſuch their diſcourſe
tends to no more, then that
ſuch an one, was the ſonne of Peter or
of Iohn.
               
               5. And a famous Rhetoritian, was
of opinion, that in telling of Tales,
or ſtoryes, if there muſt be a relation
in them, of many things, in the firſt
place we muſt order, and diſpoſe of
the names, and ſirnames, and after
it ſhall be enough, onely to repeate
the Chriſtian names, becauſe they
are given, according to the will of
their Parents, and the ſurnames according
to the quality and decency

of the perſons. And if the perſon bee
not very well knowne, in the place
where wee ſpeake of him: wee ought
to frame our diſcourſe, and ſtory, as
if the thing were done in another
place: and to fit the names, as wee
pleaſe, that wee may tell our ſtories,
with reliſh, and without interruption,
or making rubbes, or pawſes
in them.
            
            
               To uſe propriety of words.
               By this meanes, thoſe that heare
us are the better moved to attention,
and wee remaine ſatisfyed, and they
pleaſed, and this manner of ſpeaking,
is of ſuch force, is ſo proper, and
diſtinct, that (many times) it falls out,
that it ſeemes to pleaſe much, though
in it ſelfe, it bee not very pleaſing,
and ſo, that which in it ſelfe, hath
much pleaſure, may in like manner, be
delivered ſo coldly, that all the
mirth is ſpoiled thereby: and he diſcredited,
that relateth it: And although
good geſtures, and the grace
that a ſweete voyce affords, are neceſſary
in this, and is of great effect.
Yet for all this, he ſhall not be deficient,

to pleaſe well, and to bee
underſtood in the dexterity, of the
propriety he uſes, by him that knowes
what belongs to write well, and in a
good phraſe.
            
            
               Of Compariſons.
               Examples, and Compariſons, muſt
be apparent, becauſe by them is preſented
to the phātaſy, the thing compared,
as if it were really beheld:
and we ought not make Compariſons
by talking or doing fooliſhly,
As ſome who put in the dance of their
ſtory thoſe that are their auditors,
ſaying, doth your worſhip know who
ſuch an one is, the other came in this
manner, and I ſhooke him off thus,
and in ſteede of Compariſons, they
give them ſuch thumpes on the Armes,
and ſo ſtrike them with their tongues,
that no body can avoid them. There
are others that ſpeake a thouſand
fooleries, inſteed of Compariſons,
ſo improperly and ſo groſely, that
they force men to laugh at them.
As did a Prieſt in a certaine Village,
who to make ſome friends, and perſwading
them to love one another,

and ſeeke one anothers good, ſayd
unto them, you love one another, not
ſo much as my Mule, and Antonio,
Madalenaes Horſe, who went together
to the Paſture, and fed together
and came home together
againe. But if two beaſts keepe
company, and love ſo much, why
doe you not take example by them? So
that for the propriety of that which
is related, and compared, wee finde,
that men give eare, with more delight
to have that preſeuted before
their eyes, that is ſpoken of, and
which falls out to perſons we know:
then that which befalls ſtrangers
whom we never ſaw. And the reaſon
is, for that we know that ſuch an one,
of whom hee ſpeakes, was wont to
doe ſo, (having ſeene it as a thing
preſent) ſo that that which is tould
of ſtrangers, is not ſo well received
or accepted of.
               6. The words alſo, in a continued
ſpeech, as well as in other diſcourſes,
muſt be cleare, or plaine, that
every one of the company, may underſtand
them eaſily, as well in the
ſenſe, or meaning, as in the ſound, to
be good, and beſeeming: therefore

if thou canſt make thy ſelfe underſtood,
by ſaying the mouth or the
lippes, it is not good for thee to ſay,
the noſe, and thou mayſt better ſay,
thy belly is full, then the guts are full,
and if thou mayſt be underſtood by
ſaying, the belly is ſatiſfyed, it ſhall be
better for thee to ſay ſo, then, the
panch is full.
            
         
         
            CHAPTER. 13. Of Novellaes and Tales.
            BEſides the things we have ſayd,
a Gentleman will be ſure to tell
a Tale, or ſtory, that ſhall bee
ſuch, that it ſhall not have in it, uncivill
words, or obſcene paſſages, or
ſo beaſtly, that they make them loath
them that heare it, but ſuch paſſages
muſt bee related by circumlocutions,
and by civill, and honeſt wayes of expreſſion:
not ſpeaking them in plaine
termes, eſpecially if Women bee in
the company, for then wee ſhould
bee more reſerved, and the plot in
ſuch Tale, muſt bee layd ſo neately,
and artificially, that the Auditors,
may bee fed with pleaſure of it, untill

that the Auditors doe at length remaine
fully ſatisfyed, and out of
doubt, with the cloſe and concluſion
of the ſtory. And Tales and ſtories
ſhould bee ſuch, that beſides the entertaynement,
and pleaſure of them,
there may bee alſo drawn from them,
good examples, and moralls, as the
ancient makers of Fables were wont
to doe, who ſpake very artificially,
(as we may reade in their workes)
And in imitation of them, hee that
tells a ſtory, a fable, or ſuch like
diſcourſe, ought to provide, that hee
doe not often repeate the ſame words,
except neceſſity force him to it, (which
is that which is called rambling.) And
ſo, that hee doe not confound his auditors,
or perplex their memories,
hee muſt labour to take away all obſcurity,
eſpecially of many names.
So that if in the ſtory, there bee no
more, then one Prince, or one King,
who is named in the beginning; it is
then enough (afterwards) to ſay
(onely) the King, the Captaine,
the Doctor, &amp;c. And becauſe in all
parts of this treatiſe, wee labour to
urge compariſons, and examples to
the purpoſe, in this part which wee

are now upon, we will relate a ſtory
of which (it being very pleaſing to
ſome comicall perſons of good
judgement) there was made a famous
Tragecomedy. And becauſe in this
booke, we would feede moſt palates
with delight, he that ſhall not take
pleaſure in it, may skip over the
ſtory, (if it ſeeme redious,) and may
proceede, in the other matters of this
Treatiſe.
            
               The tale of the great Soldan, and of
the loves of the beautifull Axa and
the Prince of Naples.
               In the Vaſt Country of Terſia, was
a Soldan, that by his proweſſe, and
valour, had conquered many Lands,
who looſing his ſight by a miſchance
that befell him, was more ſenſible of
the great loſſe thereof, in regard that
hee was thereby diſabled to proſecute
the deſignes hee had begun,
then for any other trouble it put him
unto. Hee then calling together all
the Phyſitians of his Kingdome, that
they might apply medicines, to cure
his infirmitie: his vaſſalls, (being
deſirous of the recovery of his ſight)

brought unto him, a famous Chriſtian
Phiſitian, whom by misfortune, a
Baſha had taken priſoner: in this
man the Soldan had great confidence,
to receave help, (he having already cured
many of his vaſſalls, of many dangerous
infirmities) and ſo with large
promiſes of wealth and freedome he
put himſelfe into his hands. The
Phyſitian, uſed the beſt practiſe hee
could, to recover his ſight; but all
humane meanes hee could uſe, not
ſufficing, hee excuſed himſelfe to his
Lord, beſeeching him, that he would
accept of his good will, and intention:
but it was not accepted with
the like minde. But the Soldan was
jealous, that becauſe he was a Chriſtian,
therefore he was regardleſſe of
his recovery: And commanded that
they ſhould put him into a Dungeon,
and ordeyned, that if within eight
dayes following, he preſcribed not a
ſufficient medicine, to recover his
ſight, that hee ſhould be devoured of
his Lyons. The Phyſitian, when he
had bin ſeven dayes in the Dungeon,
and conſidering, how neere death aproched
to him, determined to finde
out a way, how to prolong his life,

by entertayning the Soldan with faigned
hopes, and ſo deſired, he might
be (againe) brought before him, that
he might try another medicine upon
him (When hee came into his preſence,
after he had excuſed himſelfe,
that hee had not all this time cured
him,) he ſpake thus unto him, That
he had found out that there was one
only cure for him, but that hee muſt
have patience, for a few dayes, wherein
he muſt put off the cure (but it ſhould
not bee long) till hee might ſearch
out (with diligence) a yong man
of a noble race, valiant, of a pure complexion,
faire, wiſe, and well eſteemed
of: for, with the blood, and heart of
ſuch a one, with the Powders, and
Herbs, that he ſhould adde, he would
recover his ſight: and that they muſt
(alſo) appoint him a place, to gather
certaine Herbes, for this purpoſe.
The Soldan, approving his ſpeech,
gave him liberty, to walke (freely)
up and downe his Court, and poſſeſſed
with this hope, hee imparted
his content, to the Suleaneſſe his
Lady, and his beautifull Daughter,
Axa, a Lady moſt famous, for her wonderfull
faireneſſe, and worth. After the

                  Soldan, diſpatcheth ſome of his
Baſha
                        •
                     s, to divers Kingdomes, that
they might finde out a priſoner that
might be fitting, for to make the medicine,
to recover his ſight promiſing
great rewards, to him, that ſhould
performe this enterpriſe. It fell out,
that as one of his Captaines, touched
with one of his gallyes, at a port of
the Kingdome of Naples, and had
there bin informed, that certaine
yong Cavalleeres, were to paſſe that
way a hunting, they lay in ambuſh
to take them, at which very ſeaſon it
fortuned, that the Prince of Naples
went alſo that way to hunt, who in
the hard purſuing of his chaſe, was ſevered
from his company: He was a
yong man of three and twenty yeares
old, and endowed with all thoſe
qualities, the Chriſtian Phyſitian, had
mentioned: who being aſſaulted by
the infidells, although he defended
himſelfe like a valiant cavalleere, after
he had ſlaine ſome of them, and hurt
many more, was nevertheleſſe (at laſt)
with much difficulty, taken, and put
into the Gally, and carried to the
great Soldan, and although they knew
him not for a Prince, yet they gueſſed

by him that he muſt be a Cavalleere of
great quality; you may eaſily cōceive,
what ſadneſſe did poſſeſſe the King, &amp;
Queene, of this Kingdom, this Princes
father, &amp; all the ſubjects, for the loſſe
of the Prince, and ſo leaving that, to its
proper time, and place, we will now
ſpeake of his voyage, wch was ſo proſperous,
that in ſhort time, they arrived
in Perſia, where he was preſēted to the
Soldan, who much pleaſed therewith
called for the Chriſtian Doctor, to
the end that, (this Cavalleere being
ſuch a man, as hee had required to
recover him withall) he might put
his medicine in practiſe. The Phyſitian,
ſeeing himſelfe thus cut off of
his excuſeand confounded in his plot,
ſpoke to the Soldan in part after this
manner. Great Sir, I cannot deny,
but this yong man, is a man fitting
for the purpoſe to recover your ſight:
but he is now troubled, and his Spirits
unquiet, and it his humours bee not
ſetled and his complexion reduced,
to its due temper, his hart will not
be uſefull, for our purpoſe, hee muſt
therefore repoſe himſelfe, a few dayes,
and a way be deviſed, how this captive
may receave content, as by ſome

vaine hope of freedome, or ſuch like
meanes; The Soldan thought well of
this, and tould it his Wife, and his
faire Daughter Axa, who offered
him, (if he would employ them in this
ſervice,) to make him ſuch offers,
and promiſes of liberty, that he ſhould
preſently be pleaſed, and contented.
Which offer the Soldan accepted of
them. Wherefore, afterwards, the
Prince was brought to the lodging,
of the Soldana (which was curiouſly
ſeated, and had a paſſage from it, to
the banke of a great River, which
not farre thence, disburthened it
ſelfe, into the Ocean,) now he was employed
for his greater grace, in ſerving
the faire Axa, who of purpoſe, and
by the command of her parents, made
very much of him, and ſhewed him,
extra ordinary favour. In like manner
the Doctor, had order, to enter (when
he pleaſed) into the Chamber of the
Empreſſe, and the Princeſſe, to obſerve,
when the Chriſtian ſhould bee
at the height of his content: that he
might give the Soldan notice, when
it was a fit time to ſacrifice him. The
Prince ſeeing the good entertainement
they gave him, could not

imagine, why (on the ſuddaine,)
he ſhould bee thus cockered, but ſuſpected,
that they had diſcovered
what hee was. And hee being indeed
very pleaſing, and a perfect Courtier,
knew (ſo well) to give content, and
to performe his ſervice ſo readily, to
his new Lady, the beautifull Axa,
that the faigned, and purpoſely counterfaited
obſervance, ſhee made ſhew
of, was turned into a true and ſincere
love, and the Prince was the meane
while no leſſe taken with her beauty.
Yet ſo warily, and ſecretly they
both carried their loves, that when
any beheld them, it ſeemed to be all
in jeſt. The Doctor whoſe thoughts
were not all this while idle, ſeeing
what haſt was made, deviſed a way,
how he might eſcape from them. For
it was reſolved that the fift day following,
the Chriſtian ſhould be ſacrificed,
and ſo, he failing in his cure,
ſhould bee devoured of the Lyons.
About the ſame time he went out one
evening, into the Orchard, where the
Soldana, and her Daughter, with the
Chriſtian, were alſo walking together,
And as they walked, the Prince,
and Princeſſe went aſide, and ſhee

laying her hand upon his ſhoulder,
and looking wiſhly upon him, conjured
him by the great love ſhe bare
him, to tell her, who hee was, promiſing
to keepe it ſecret; who moved
with much confidence of her love,
and faith of her promiſe, and with the
ſweet words, this Lady gave him, tould
her the truth, that he was the Prince
and onely heyre of Naples, beſeeching
her, by all meanes, not to diſcover
him, for the great difficulty, he
ſhould thereby finde, for his ranſome.
But as ſoone as ſhee underſtood, what
hee was, and the danger hee was in,
ſhee began to weepe bitterly, yet for
feare of her mother ſhee diſſembled it,
as much as ſhee was able: at this inſtant,
the Soldana winked upon the
Doctor, that he ſhould come, and ſee
if the Chriſtian were in a good temper,
ſhewing him the great cunning
her Daughter had uſed, to deceive
him, and to bring him into good
temper, and to make him to be well ſatisfyed:
and ſhe in the while ſtood to
behold, at ſome diſtance off, in the
Orchard; But when the Doctor came
to the place where the two Lovers
were, the faire Axa begun ſecretly

to curſe him, and bad him, that hee
ſhould take ſome courſe, that hee did
not performe, what hee had agreed
upon, but that hee ſhould cure her
father another way: if not, that hee
was to know, that if he did, as he had
propoſed, though hee ſhould cure
him, yet ſhee would kill him, (but
eſpecially becauſe ſhee well perceived,
that all was but ſubtilty, to prolong
his life,) And turning to the Prince,
ſhee ſayd, Ah Sir, it is now no time
to conceale from you, what is determined
concerning you, but that
we preſently ſtudy a remedy. And ſo
ſhee tould him the ſentence, that
was given againſt him: and all the
paſſages thereof, and in what manner
his death was appointed (by the
conſent of this Doctor) but that hee
ſhould not be troubled at it, for ſhee
would marke out a way, how he might
free himſelfe, which was, that they
three, (as they were) muſt take
their flight, in a little Barke, that
was in the River, and ſo commend
themſelves to their good fortunes.
And from thence, ſhe vowed her ſelfe,
to bee a Chriſtian, and deſired him
by the ſaith of a Husband, that hee

would take her, to his Kingdome,
and accept her for the Princeſſe thereof.
And ſhee declared unto them that
by meanes of certaine charmes, that
ſhee had learnt of her Mother, ſhee
would (next day) take order, to
caſt her Mother, and her women,
into a ſleepe: that in the meane time,
they three, might eſcape, with all her
Fathers treaſure, of which ſhee kept
the Keyes. The Prince, remayned
aſtoniſhed, when hee underſtood,
what had paſſed, but much more, at
the ready ability, of his Lady, and
of the great love ſhee had ſhewen him.
The plot pleaſed them exceeding
well, but it not then being the time,
to put this buſineſſe, in execution,
they agreed to doe it, the next day,
as ſoon as the Soldan had ſupped, and
ſo they made the appointment, as the
faire Axa had chalked it out. The
next day, ſhee conveyed her ſelfe into
the Chamber, where her Fathers
treſour was, and there ſhee tooke out
of certaine Cheſts, the beſt Jewells,
and pretious Stones he had, and tooke
alſo much Gold thence to an incredible
value, being indeed the greateſt
part of that the Soldan and his predeceſſors,

had bin gathering together
for many yeares paſt, when this
was done, ſhee tooke order how to
intercept a barke, one of the beſt on
the River, by an excuſe that ſhee
made, that her ſelfe, and her Mother,
and ſome other Ladies, were to take
their pleaſure in it as at other times,
they were wont to doe. When night
came, and ſupper was ended, the faire
Axa, by meanes of the inchantments,
and magick, ſhee had knowledge in,
put one in practiſe, which was to
pitch a ſcedule of partchment written
with Dragons blood, and to ſtick it
to the gowne of the Soldana, which
was no ſooner done but ſhe fell into
adeepe ſleepe, and ſo dead it was,
that ſhee awaked not, till late the
next day. Then ſhee commanded all
the Women to retire, and hid the
Prince and Doctor, in the ſame
Chamber, where the treſour was, and
when ſhee knew that they were all at
reſt, and that the Soldana could not
be awaked, ſhee went cheerefully to
her Husband, and at laſt all three,
helping one another, they put all this
wealth, in Cheſtes, and by little and
little, put them into the Barke, and amongſt

other things, of great eſteeme;
they had taken a ſword, which (beſides
the richneſſe of the ſtones, it was
ſet withall) it was of ſuch power,
that whereſoever it cut, it diſſolved all
charmes and inchantments. And in
like manner ſhee tooke a Ring of memory
all of one Diamond, as well
the hoope, as the ſtone, made in two
partes, which being joyned together,
had a vertue in it, that hee that
had it, could remember what ever he
had done, or had happened unto
him, unto that preſent time. With
this treaſure, and rich apparell, that
Axa had put up, they went all three
abroad the Bark, who ayded with ſailes
and oars, they were favoured ſo much,
that being now on the maine Ocean,
in a happy time, they doubled the
Cape of Naples, which Kingdome
they diſcovered one morning at break
of day. The joy of all three was
great, but eſpecially of the beautifull
Princeſſe, who with amorous diſcourſe
did ſolemnize her great content,
in behoulding Chriſtendome, and
for enjoyng the company of her beloved
Prince. At this very inſtant,
Axa behold a farr off a Barke appeare,

that made towards them, with all
ſpeede, and being much troubled,
ſhee turned to the Prince, ſaying,
alas my Lord, the Barke we have diſcovered,
is the Soldanas Barke, my
Mother, who with her magick, and
enchantments, is able to deſtroy us
without reſiſtance. The Prince did
comfort her, making it a ſport that
one Woman ſhould bee able to conquer
him, but the greateſt comfort
that ſhee found, was the remembrance
of the Soldans ſword, that the
Prince wore, and ſo (although with
great feare, and many teares,) ſhee
was perſwaded, that there was no
other remedy but that they muſt cut
ſomething, which belonged to the
Bark, and not ſuffer themſelves, to
be grapled with, that they might not
bee overthrowne; In the Interim the
Soldana came up to them, with great
bravery, reviling them, and calling
the Prince ruffian, and the Princes
whore, and threatning them, that
now they ſhould never eſcape her
hands: the Prince adviſed her not to
come neere him, except ſhee deſired
her owne deſtruction: but the not regarding
his counſell, came to board

him, and faſtening her grapling hands
upon part of the Princes Barke, to
leape into it. The Prince (that was
very vigilant) cut them off with as
much of the Barke, as they had laid
hould upon: and ſo (by force) ſevered
her, from them. The Soldana,
when ſhee ſaw that by the vertue of
the ſword, hee had defended himſelfe
from her, being able to doe no
more, ſpake in a rage to her daughter,
in this manner: well Traytreſſe, though
you have ſuch confidence in your ruffian,
I will bring it ſo to paſſe, that
the firſt Woman, that hee ſhall embrace,
hee ſhall forget thee: and ſo
ſhee returned as fierce as a Lyoneſſe,
with the loſſe of her fingers. They
ſeeing themſelves freed of this danger,
and neere the Kingdome of Naples,
got into the heaven with great content:
where the Prince, diſſembling
himſelfe very much, becauſe hee deſired
not then to be knowne, made the
Captaine of the Caſtle there, (being
a man of his old acquaintance) to be
called unto him. To whom onely,
(in private) he diſcovered himſelfe.
The Captaine being amazed at this
ſight, was falling downe upon his

Knees, to kiſſe his hands, and feete,
but the Prince winked upon him, and
commanded him to conceale him:
and that hee ſhould entertaine him,
but as an ordinary Cavalleere, becauſe
he did not as yet deſire, to make
himſelfe knowne, and ſo cauſing the
Barke to bee unladen of his Coffers,
they went to refreſh themſelves at his
Houſe; where he imparted his great
joy onely to his Wife, and his two
Daughters. And you may well geſſe
what joy this was, when as for the
loſſe of this their Prince, all the country
(after a moſt ſad manner) mourned
in blacke ſack-cloath. But being
come thither, the firſt thing Axa
did, was to bee Chriſtend, by the
hand of a Biſhop, to whom they
were faine to diſcover themſelves, for
this purpoſe. And at the ſame time
the Prince was alſo married to the
faire Axa. And ſo the next day, The
Prince commending the care of her,
to the Captaine, and his Wife, and
Daughters, he and the Doctor departed
in ſtrangers habites, to preſent
himſelfe to his Father, that himſelfe
might bee the firſt, that might

                     〈◊〉
                   the reward, for this newes:

promiſing his new married Lady to
come back againe to her thither, and
to receive her into the Country with
great ſolemnity. Shee ſuſpecting the
ſucceſſe, beſtowed on him, and put
upon his finger halfe the Diamond
Ring of memory before mentioned,
and kept the other halfe by her ſelfe.
In this manner, they went to the
Court, where his parents, the King
and Queene were, and entred into
the Palace. Then the teares trickled
from this good Princes eyes, as well
for joy hee received to ſee his parents,
as for the griefe, that his abſence had
cauſed ſo great ſorrow throughout
the Kingdome, And after telling the
waiters, that hee had a buſineſſe
of importance, to impart unto the
King, he was admitted into the preſence:
and there being full of content,
after he had paſſed a thouſand
jeſts, and paſſages of mirth, with the
Cavalleeres, hee diſcovered himſelfe
unto them: that they might (by degrees,)
make his Father underſtand
of 
                     〈◊〉
                   comming▪ leaſt exceſſe of joy
by the ſuddaine knowledge of his

                     〈◊〉
                   cauſe ſome dangerous

                     〈◊〉
                   in him. All this 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                  
well caryed, &amp; ſo at length the Father,
&amp; Sonne received one the other, with
many teares, and embraces. And
as the Prince was relating to the King,
all the diſcourſe of his captivity, and
how by meanes of the faire Axa, hee
was delivered, in comes his Mother,
trembling, and much altered, with
her ſuddaine joy, and imbraced him,
ſhedding many teares, untill the
King interrupted her and ſayd to the
Queene; as you love my life be ſtille.
That my Sonne may proceede, in the
moſt exquiſite ſtory, (of his travells)
that ever was heard: and ſo hee requeſted
him to proceed, and to declare,
where hee had left the faire
Axa hee ſpake of. The Prince wholy
forgetfull what he had ſayd, as if he
were aſtoniſhed, at ſome new accident,
made anſwer, that he knew not Axa,
nor whether there were ſuch a one,
or no, nor did he ever ſee any ſuch perſon.
And the more the King wondered
at it, the more the Prince denyed
it: ſo that the Queene 
                     〈…〉
                  
King, and encreated him to leave
this diſcourſe, and 
                     〈…〉
                  
to him of 
                     〈…〉
                  
nothing then but to 
                     〈…〉
                  
                  
they all poſſeſſed. And ſo was the
newes divulged, and great expreſſions
of joy were made through the whole
Kingdome; And becauſe the King
had (formerly) bin upon treaty of a
marriage for the Prince with the
Queene of Cicily, (which by reaſon
of his being loſt, was hitherto ſtayd)
hee now againe ſent his Embaſſadors
to her, with the conſent, and liking
of his Sonne, the Prince, who without
thinking of his Lady Axa, approved
well of it. But when the
Doctor ſaw this, and that the Prince
did not onely forbeare to proceede,
with his great entertaynement for his
Lady Axa: but did not ſo much as
thinke of her: being much grieved, he
returned, to the place, where ſhe remayned,
but he found that ſhe was not
much altered by this accidēt, but ſhewing
a good ſemblance, to the Captaine,
commanded him, and the Doctor
to goe to the Court, and to provide
her the beſt lodging, which was to
be had, without the Pallace, giving
them much Gold, and Silver, out of
her treaſure, and licence to ſpend a
great part of it, in furniſhing of the
ſayd lodging: ſhee alſo ſent a meſſenger

to the King, to let him underſtand,
that a Princeſſe of a ſtrange
Country, was comming to his Court,
about an important buſineſſe, and
that his Majeſty ſhould take order,
for her entertaynement, according
as was ſuiting to her quality, and eſtate.
The King, wondering from
whom ſo great a Lady, could come,
commanded ſhee ſhould bee receaved,
by the Cavalleeres of his Court: requiring
her to diſcover whom ſhee
was, that he might not fall ſhort, in
giving her the honour due unto her;
The faire Axa anſwered, that his
Majeſty ſhould know from her owne
mouth, who ſhe was; ſo the Captaine,
having provided a ſtately Houſe, adorned
with curious furniture, and
well furniſhed with ſervants, and officers,
fitting for the Houſe of a
Queene, the King tooke order to receave
the faire Axa, with great preparation,
curiouſly trimming the ſtreets
through which ſhee was to paſſe, and
providing the beſt inventions, playes
and dauncing that could be thought
on to entertaine her withall. In this
manner ſhee made her entry, being
habited in as rich a faſhion, as ever

Queene or Princeſſe was beheld attired
with, And being indeede (for
beauty) the paragon of the World,
ſo ſhee ſeemed to all that beheld her,
to be more then a humane Creature.
The King and the Queene, ſtood
privately and by themſelves, where
they might behold her, as ſhee paſſed
from her Houſe to the Court, and
ſo did the Prince, who as ſhee paſſed
by him, vailed his Beaver, and
ſhee returned her complementall reſpect
to him, looking wiſhly and affectionately
upon him, as one that
had not yet forgot him. Who although
that ſhoe appeared to him, to
be the moſt curious Creature, that ever
hee beheld, yet did he not at all remember
her, but he tooke notice how
paſſionately ſhee had eyed him, by
which, and by her wonderfull beauty,
he became a freſh enamored. And
thus the faire Axa, with much aſtoniſhment
to all the Court, made her
entry, diſtributing many rich gifts,
and preſents, unto the Courtiers.
The next morning, the King ſent to
viſit her, by his Lord high Steward,
who (though hee were a brave
Courtyer,) when hee entred to deliver

the complement, his ſpeech was
taken from him, with behoulding her
wonderfull beauty, nor could he call
to minde what hee was to ſay. Axa
entreated him to ſit downe, and gave
him much reſpect, with which hee
was the more aſtoniſhed, not knowing,
how to diſpatch his errand, nor
how to depart thence: the Princeſſe,
(feigning that ſhee de red much his
company, and that his good intentions
did well ſatisfy her) gave way
he might ſup with her. And by this
favour, ſhee encreaſed his blindneſſe
ſo much, that hee deſired, that ſhee
would ſuffer him, to lye there that
night, though it were but upon a
bench, becauſe hee could not finde
the way thence. To whom the beautifull
Axa anſwered, that he ſhould
not only lye there, as he deſired, but
that he ſhould lye in her own Chamber.
The high Steward, much pleaſed
with this, accepted of it, and
when bed-time was come, hee asked
for a Combe and a Bruſh to combe
himſelfe withall ſaying to the Princeſſe,
that hee alwayes uſed to doe
thus, and that it was the cuſtome of
the Country ſo to doe: then the Princeſſe

preſented him a Combe with
her own hand, and he begun to combe
himſelfe therewith, while ſhee ſat
confidently by him, for hee did nothing
but call her, to ſit by him, and
ſayd the good of the high Steward,
might excuſe her, ſo he ſtood (thus)
combing himſelfe, ſo long, that hee
much galled his head, for hee continued
ſo doing till morning without
ceaſing. At what time, the Prince
came thither, and ſaw this, and
tooke out of his hands the Combe
and Bruſh, ſending him away like a
block-head, telling him, he had neede
to combe himſelfe, becauſe ſhe would
not doe it for him. In this manner
the poore Steward, much aſhamed,
went to the King, with his armes very
weary, and the skin galled off his
head, with the much combing it,
complayning, what wrong the ſtrange
Princeſſe had done him, for which
hee was well laughed at by the King
Queene, and Prince, who did nothing,
but jeere him for it; but much
more the Queenes Lord Chamberlaine
telling him, that becauſe hee was
thus finely combed; they durſt not
keepe him company. Wherefore the

Queene commanded, that he ſhould
bee employed on the ſame buſineſſe,
that ſhee might ſee, what ſucceſſe he
would have. He was very well contented
with it, but there happened a
like misfortune to him, that did to
the former, but by another way.
For when he had dyned and ſupped,
and troden the ſame ſteps, that the
other had done, the Princeſſe offering
him a Combe, and a Bruſh, he
excuſed himſelfe (thinking thereby,
he had overcome all) anſwering that
hee had no neede of combing, but he
had a very great longing, to put out
the Candle, that was there burning,
and ſo he went to blow it out, and
ſtill as he put it out, it was lighted
againe, and hee ſtill renewed his
blowing of it, and thus he continued
all night, who ſtill when the Princeſſe
called him, anſwered, I will come
Madam, when I have put out the
Candle, which ſhall never get the
victory of mee. At which the Princeſſe,
and many of her Ladies, that
were there, with her, made much
mirth: And thus exerciſed, he paſſed
the whole night, and in the morning
ſhee ſent him away, much

aſhamed. Hee returned to the King,
and the Queene, who deſired to bee
ſatisfyed, why he ſtayd ſo long▪ the
Lord ſteward that was ſo combed, was
ſo much pleaſed, to ſee him ſo much
troubled, that his owne vexation was
thereby much leſſened: and the rather
for that his head did now begin
to be better, and (The King, Queene
and the Prince, ſtanding in doubt,
from whence ſo faire, and wiſe a
Woman, ſhould come) there came
a meſſage, from her, requeſting the
King, to give her audience, in the
buſineſſe ſhe came for, which was granted
her, &amp; he forth with commanded
ſhee ſhould come thither, and when
ſhe aſcended the Pallace, the Queene,
and her Ladies were ready to receive
her; and ſo ſhee entred moſt gloriouſly,
and richly, deſiring to kiſſe the
Kings hands, which might not bee
granted, before hee knew what ſhee
was, and what ſhee deſired. Shee proſtrated
her ſelfe before him, and tooke
them by force, ſaying, that preſently
they ſhould ſee, whether they
might give her them, with a good
will; and with that, ſhee required
Juſtice of the King, to cauſe halfe a

Ring of memory, that the Prince had
robbed her of to bee reſtored unto
her, which Ring ſhe ſayd, the
Prince did then weare upon his finger.
The Prince much bluſhing ſayd,
that it was true, that hee had ſuch a
Ring; but that he did not remember
that hee tooke it from her: then the
Princeſſe pulled off that which ſhee
had upon her owne finger, and putting
it upon the Princes finger, and
joyning, and fitting it, into the other,
the Prince came to himſelfe, as
if he had awaked from a dream; and
his eyes being opened, and ſeeing his
Lady Axa, before him, firſt falling
downe upon his knees, before her, he
(preſently) went and tooke her in
his armes, and ſayd unto her; O my
Lady, and true Spouſe, and my
greateſt bliſſe: and then he proceeded,
to tell the King, and Queene, his
parents, his ſtory: and how much he
was engaged, to this faire Princeſſe,
who with joy embraced, and received
her for their Daughter, and being
in the middeſt of their joy, there entred
the Embaſſadors, that came
from Sicily, and declared, that the
Queene was already married, to another

King her neighbour: who at
the very time, they were in treaty,
came with a great Navy, and carried
her to his owne Country, and there
married her, at which they were much
pleaſed, ſeeing how happily all things
fell out, and ſo the Prince, and the
moſt wiſe, and beautifull Axa, ſucceeding
their parents, in the Kingdome,
did long reigne, with happy
peace, and proſperity.
            
            
               The end of the Tale, and proceeding of
the Author, in his matter.
               He ought alſo that takes upon him
to tell any ſtory or tale, (like this)
although hee have many to tell, and
that they heare him willingly, to give
way, that every one, may tell his
owne ſtory, and not to exceede his
lymits (ſo farre,) in this kinde, that
hee ſhould bee accompted tedious or
troubleſome: nor to invite men to be
alwayes telling ſuch ſtories, for the
principall uſe of them, is but to fill up
idle time.
               2. One muſt alſo take heede in this,
as in all other manner of diſcourſes,
that hee obſerve the propriety, and

purity of words, and not leaving the
common uſe, and true Caſtilian
tongue, rather ſtriving for plaineneſſe,
then curioſity, ſo that if in common
diſcourſe, we be to ſay the Sunne, we
ſhould not ſay, the light of the world,
nor to ſay he ſtood in the frontiſpice
of his Houſe, when we ſhould ſay he
ſtood in the porch, or entry thereof.
Nor when one ſhould ſay, he tooke
the freſh ayre of the morning, to ſay
that hee received the Zephirus of
Aurora, nor in ordinary things, to
uſe words, which are ſtrangers, in
our language, like ſome, that thinke
they ſhew great learning, in drawing
old words, out of uſe, into their
diſcourſes.
               3. But what ſhall wee ſay of the
coyned phraſes, of ſome I deots, that
labour to ſpeake in metaphors, and
high and excellent ſtraynes, as they
conceive.
               4. A ſtudent, one Chriſtmas comming
home to ſee his parents, and
kindred, as he ſtood with them, by
the fire, thinking to ſhew his learning
by ſpeaking in an extraordinary
manner, inſteed of ſaying, lay this
wood on the fire, ſayd thus, Lady

Nurſe, apply theſe materialls, to the
conſumer of all things, for you ſee,
that the biting tooth of nature, makes
me in a walking temper. His Father
that was well ſtudyed, and a good
ſpeaker, replyed to this, mee thinkes
my Sonne, that the want you felt in
the Caſtilian tongue you have as well
met withall in the Latine, and that in
a worſe manner, for you might have
expreſſed more in a plaine Song, then
you have done, in the counter point.
I ſay then, that our words ought to
be ſuch, as may bee ſignificant, and
plaine to bee underſtood, according
to the cuſtome of the place, where
thou art, and not ſo obſolete, that
they are growne ruſty, (as the proverb
goes.) For it is better to ſay
Tapiz, which is Tapiſtry or French
Cloath, then Paramentos, which is
an old word, that ſignifyes the ſame
thing, and to ſay Enſenar to teach,
then Averzar, being an old word, that
ſignifyes the ſame thing, And Accoſtombrado,
accuſtomed, and not
as others uſe to ſay, Eſtoy hecho a
eſto, which ſignifyes the ſame thing.
I except Labourers, and Peſants, and
other people of poore places, although

we make ſport of their language: yet
it becomes them well, and if they
ſtrive to alter their ordinary way, it
ſhewes ill. And according to their accompt,
you ſhall finde ſuch underſtanding
men amongſt them, that they
may give us fifteene and a fault, as the
proverbe goes, that thinke our ſelves
wiſer.
               But it is not to bee doubted, but
for the moſt part, if wee could heare
the paſſages betwixt ſome of them,
in their conſultations, and diſcourſes,
wee would bee much taken with
them.
               5. A curious Courtier, walking in
the habit of a labourer, paſſed through
a Village, at the time they were in
councell, and ſo by meanes of his
habit, that hee wore, hee was permitted,
to behold what paſſed there,
and at that inſtant, he ſaw one of the
country fellowes, that ſat there, ſtand
up, and putting off his Cap ſpake
thus to the Juſtices of the place. Noble
Lords, Juan Gamorro &amp; Pedro Garcia
ſe quieren chapar por cohadres if
it pleaſe you. The moſt ancient of
the Judges anſwered him thus. No
engemineys tantos in lo c
                        •
                     hadria, que

ſuccedera eugobello, ſo that we cannot
determine of it.
               6. In another more obſcure place
he ſayd hee ſaw another Judge that
being troubled ſpake thus, come
you hither Meculas of Ana and tell
mee why you weare that Dagger,
Meculas de Ana anſwered him, I may
weare it for my defence, to which the
Judge in anger anſwered as he ſat upon
the bench, take it from him, and
ſet him on the Pillory, and take it for
Law, that I ſentence him and command
it. The concept of the Author
is not to bee underſtood but in the
Spaniſh.
               
               7. Returning then to our purpoſe,
I ſay, that our words muſt be plaine,
and this we may doe, if we know how
to uſe ſuch as have their originall,
and naturall ſignification, from the
Land we are in: and they ought not
to be ſo old, that they prove hard to
be underſtood, and out of all uſe:
like old Clothes, and habites, ſo
that if when wee ought to leave them
off, we ſhall goe abroad with them,
we ſhall bee pointed at, and derided
for ſo doing. And therefore, he that
ſhall ſay, Membroſe for Acordarſe,
                  
or ome Bueno for hombre Bueno, and
ſincar for que dar, and ſuch like, ſhall
doe very ill.
               8. In like manner, our words muſt
be as proper, as may be, to expreſſe
that which we deſire to ſhew by them,
and leſſe ſignificant, and common to
expreſſe other things by; As to ſay,
hee was knowne Enlas faciones, by
his faſhion, is more proper then to
ſay he was knowne En la figura o
Imagen. And it is better to ſay, Reclino
le Puerta, que no grito la puerta,
the dore ſqueekes, and we may more
properly ſay, Et tremblor de quarātana
then El frio the ſhaking of the quartan
Ague, and many ſuch like as
theſe.
               9. None can well ſpeak to another,
in the tongue which hee unto whom
he ſpeaketh underſtandeth not, and
for this reaſon, thoſe that are curious,
and eſpecially ſtrangers doe labour
to underſtand Latine, becauſe it is a
tongue ſo common in the World, and
which they teach by art unto thoſe
that are to travell, into ſtrange Countries.
And in my opinion, thoſe
who have or may have meanes to
learne it, ought not to neglect the

knowledge thereof, that they may
enjoy the treaſure, that is written in
that language. And the reaſon that
in Spaine, men doe not ordinarily
diſcourſe ſo well, as in other Kingdomes,
is, becauſe in many places
thereof, they teach many rules, and
doe very little exerciſe to diſcourſe,
but for a mans ordinary cuſtome, none
ought to alter his mother tongue,
except neceſſity require. And if a
Spaniard be to diſcourſe with an Italian,
or one of another language,
whom hee knowes doth well underſtand
the Caſtilian tongue, he is not
bound to ſpeake to him in any other
then his owne Caſtilian tongue. Neither
is an Italian, or ſtranger, that
knowes that the Spaniard (with
whom hee diſcourſes) underſtands
him, tyed to ſpeake Caſtilian, or to
excuſe himſelfe for his fooliſh language:
And it hath bin ſeene that an
Italian hath ſpoken in Spaniſh, with
a Spaniard, for vaine glory, and oftentations
ſake, and a Spaniard to anſwer
him in Italian, and both one,
and the other, to ſpeake ſuch broken
language, that they might eaſily diſcover
one another to ſpeake ill, and

any other, that heard them, muſt
needs laugh at them, to heare the
improprieties and fooleries ſpoken of
them.
               10. There was after this manner
a Spaniard that met with an Italian
his friend, and each of them ſpeaking
the others language, when they had
ſpoken much on both ſides without
well underſtanding each the other:
The Spaniard ſpake to the Italian in
this manner, Sir I am of opinion, that
except we change tongues, wee can
proceede no farther, therefore let me
have my Caſtilian tongue, and doe you
take your Italian.
               
               11. To this purpoſe, I can tell you
of a great drinker, that called a Iew
newly become a Chriſtian, drunkard,
and the other called him Iew, and
having accuſed and ſued each the other,
for the ſame, the Judge being
in examination of the buſineſſe, The
drunkard ſayd, Sir he confeſſeth hee
called me Iew, and I deny not but
that I did call him drunkard, let them
therefore paſſe one for the other,
and ſo we are even: if not, let him returne
me my drunkard, I will returne
him his Iew, and ſo the Judge ſet

them both free, and made them
friends. I ſay then returning to my
matter, that wee muſt take heede of
ſpeaking in a ſtrange language, when
there is no neceſſity to doe it.
               12. A diſcreete Gentleman muſt
(in like manner) bee ſure that his
words bee modeſt, and honeſt and
well ſounding, I meane that they be
well ſounding or delivered in a good
tone, and have a good ſignification, for
there are ſome words, that ſound in the
meaning of them, and not in the letter
of thē, as when they ſay, ſhe recoyled
inſteed of ſhe fell backward, which
as to the meaning of it, is better; and
it may more honeſtly be ſayd, his ſhee
friend, then his harlot, and of a diſhoneſt
woman ſuch a one is her ſervant,
then to ſay, he is ruffian to ſuch a
yong Queane, and ſuch like or worſe
words. And when we may expreſſe
things of this nature by one word, it is
better to doe it ſo then with two, as to
ſay, much good may it doe you, and
he gained, and enjoyed her. Except
he chang it into mirth, which a Country
fellow found, who comming for
a diſpenſation ſayd to the Juſtice of
the Court, Sir, They have made mee

come hither to buy a diſpēſa, or diſpenſation
from the Sumo Ponfize, meaning
the Pope, &amp; the notary asking him Si avi
tēido acceſſo o copula if he had layē with
her or had copulation, Hee anſwered
I Sr. ya hemos tenido eucientios y popula,
and ſhee is with child, that thankes be
to God, they cannot accompt me
pro omnipotente, meaning an impotent
fellow. There befell a witty accident
to a Lawyer of this Court, from a
Country fellow, who being of his
counſell, after hee had diſcourſed of
his caſe, hee ſayd unto him, maſter
Lawyer, I deſire with your worſhips
leave, that I may give your wife two
blowes on the buttockes, the Lawyer
was ſomething troubled with this, untill
the labourer proceeded in this
manner, ſaying, indeed I am the bolder
to give them, becauſe the Bacon
is good, and ſo the miſtake was, that
inſteed of ſaying Lunadas de tocino,
gammons of Bacon, hee called them
nalgadas, which ſignifyes claps on the
buttocks.
               13. Of all theſe things we ought to
be admoniſhed of, in our common
diſcourſe, and being to handle a larger
ſubject, every one may make uſe of the

rules and inſtructions of Rethorick.
But in that which we heere call good
courtſhip, we muſt uſe modeſt, gentile,
and ſweete language, that may have
no bitterneſſe in them, and ſo wee
ſhould rather ſay. I doe not well expreſſe
my ſelfe, then that you cannot
underſtand me. We will try, if it be ſo
as you ſay, then to ſay, you are deceived,
or it is not true, or you doe not
know it. For it is a courtly and pleaſing
faſhion, to excuſe another, even in
that that thou knoweſt he is too blame
in. We ought alſo to make our friends
errour, common to our ſelves, and to
take part of it, upon our ſelves, and
after to reprove him, in a ſeaſonable
time, ſaying, we were out of the way
and we never thought to doe this, although
the truth be, that the forgetfulneſſe
was in the other, and not, in
him that took the fault upon him. And
if any one promiſe thee any thing, &amp;
cannot accompliſh it, or be forgetfull
of it, it is not civill to ſay, you have
broke your credit or promiſe with me,
or you have not kept your word, you
have not regarded mee. For ſuch
words are pricking, and ſharp, and
imply in them, ſome ſuſpition of infamy,

or reproach, and thoſe that uſe
ſuch language, are accompted harſh,
and ſimple, and ſo men avoid them,
and their friendſhip: like unto them
that ſhun to entangle themſelves, with
briars and brambles, which two to
one, (although it be for things of no
weight) are occaſioned to bring us to
deſtruction. And ſo wee muſt never
ſpeake, except firſt, we have framed in
our minds, what to ſpeake, that thy
diſcourſe may be well delivered, and
be conſonant in it ſelfe. Nor as little
oughteſt thou, to ſeeke to bee the
ſpeaker, in aſſemblies, or meetings, nor
as little oughteſt thou when thou art
amongſt thy equalls, to be alwayes ſilent:
yet in theſe two extremes, thou
canſt leſſe erre, in holding thy peace.
As they tell of one Piobano that was
in Italy, a very pleaſing man, and diſcreete,
that when one gave him many
injurious, and opprobrious ſpeeches,
he heard them patiently, and ſayd
nothing to them, and being asked
why hee held his peace, and did not
anſwer for himſelfe: made anſwer,
that whilſt the other was ſpeaking, he
was conſidering, that he never yet repented,
for being ſilent, but for ſpeaking

he had often repented him.
               14. True it is, that thoſe that ſpeake
well, and gracefully, without wronging
of others, are blameleſſe. Yet for all
this, it muſt be done ſo modeſtly, that
they give way with patience for others
to ſpeake, ſo that they doe not
ſpeake out of their courſe, to the end
that they may have all the talke alone.
For there be ſome that in this error of
talking too much, are ſo paſſionate,
that they place all their delight, and
pleaſure, in them, that will give them
leave to talke.
               15. And if by chance there be two
talkers, at one meeting, it is a wonder
to finde them agree well: for each of
them will ſtrive, to be the Cock of the
company, where he is. As it fell out
to a Cavallero, in this Court, that was
a great talker, that being to goe to Cordova,
the day he was to take his journey,
he entertayned a lacquay, to accompany
him, who (according to his
ability) was as great a talker as his
maſter. And ſo it fell out that from the
time he went out of Madrid, till hee
came to the place whither he was to
make his firſt dayes journey, for foure
leagues they had travelled, the maſter

never ceaſed talking, to his new ſervant
asking him queſtions, and telling
him ſtories, not giving his ſervant
leave to ſpeake one word. For which
cauſe he tooke his leave of him, ſaying,
your worſhip hath tyred your
ſelfe, and I give you no thankes for it:
For your worſhip is a great talker, and
I have the ſame paſſion of talking, and
if I may not play my play, and take
my turne, but muſt bee forced to goe
from hence to Cordova, without ſpeaking,
I ſhould bee ſo full that I muſt
burſt, and therefore I would goe no
further with you, for more then I have
agreed with you for.
               16. But except thou obſerve a little
theſe inſtructions, I adviſe thee, that
when thou art to ſpeake, thou be carefull
to underſtand the minde, of thoſe
thou diſcourſeſt withall, and ſute
thy talke to the applauſe of thoſe that
heare thee.
               17. Be not ſo confident, to ſtand,
liſtning, I ſay hugging and applauding
thy ſelfe, making faces, and mouthes,
and antique geſtures, alwayes reaching
out thy armes, and hands, as if thou
wert to act ſome body. For there are
ſome that all they fancy in their

braines, they faſhion it out with their
hands, playing it upon all their fingers.
               18. The voyce muſt not be hoarſe,
nor ſhrill, nor muſt we be very loud,
when we have cauſe to laugh, or for
any other accident, like ſome, that
skreeke like cartes, that want greaſing,
nor can any ſpeake whilſt he makes
ſuch a noiſe. Nor to be ſo heedleſſe of
our memories as to begin to ſpeake a
word, and then to ſtand ſtuttering a
good while, ere we can utter it. And
hee that is hoarſe or hath an ill utterance,
ſhould not deſire to ſpeake much,
but let him correct the fault of his
tongue, with ſilence and attention to
others, who may alſo with care, and
ſtudy, hide his naturall imperfection.
As little pleaſing is it, to lift up ones,
voyce, as one that calles out for help,
nor to ſpeake ſo ſoftly, that he cannot
be heard, and except they heare thee
at firſt, thou muſt the ſecond time
raiſe thy voyce, and not to be always
wedded to one tone. Yet muſt thou
as little ſpeake too ſhrill, becauſe they
did not before heare thee when thou
ſpakeſt ſo ſoftly. Thy words muſt
then be well marſhalled, according to
the uſe, and cuſtome, and not wound,

and wreathen, here and there, nor intricate,
(as ſome in gallantry uſe to
doe) as to ſay my light is diſlighted,
by your light, which are expreſſions
only fitting for Poets. Except when
with conſent of all, and for mirth ſake,
they are diſcourſing of poetry, and
making verſes. Then if thou ſhalt ſee
that thoſe of thine owne profeſſion,
and age, doe entertaine, &amp; buſy themſelves
in this, thou oughteſt not to bee
out of order, or ſtrange: but to ſay
ſomething thou knoweſt, as it comes
to thy turne, and if thou have no faculty
in poetry, let it be very little
that thou ſpeakeſt retiring in time like
a good ſencer. Wherfore to conclude,
ſuch exerciſe is not ordinarily to bee
uſed, as we ſhall hereafter declare.
            
         
         
            CHAPTER. 14. Of thoſe that have no abilities to it, and
yet will needs be Poets.
            BEcauſe we have hitherto treated,
of the knowledge how to ſpeake
well, and to jeſt, and of the readineſſe
which is required therein, and
alſo of thoſe, who without ability of

wit, doe adventure to diſcourſe, and
entertaine company, more to content
themſelves, then their auditors. I will
now treate of boldneſſe that ſome uſe,
in the ſubject of poetry.
            1. For the which I will firſt give
you for a rule, what warineſſe a curious
gentleman, is to obſerve in uſing of
this ſubject: for his breeding, and
gentilenes, binde him not to have skill
in it, neither let him ſpend his time
in it, if his naturall inclination doe not
helpe him much in it. For though
there be many rules to be knowne, the
principall to be learnt is, for every
one to know his owne naturall inclination,
and ability to it, for poetry to
make it pleaſing, muſt be very good.
For if in any thing, there be no meane,
it is in this. True it is, that few make
verſes, that are not very confident, and
that thinke they are the beſt, that ever
were made, and as the palate, and
opinion of the people, is divers, ſo
they may (always) finde ſome, that
will applaud and hearken unto them,
and peradventure ſome that will preferre
them before very good poets,
for the novelty, and difference there
is betweene them, and thoſe that have

gone before them. As in like manner,
there are ſome, that are ſo wedded
to antiquity, that no moderne piece
of poetry, doth pleaſe them, though
it be more quick, and elegant, then
thoſe old poems, they have in memory,
which were made in their yonger
times. For there are ſome that but one
paire of ſhooes can fit (as they ſay) ſo
that that which they heare firſt, doth
ſo cloy their pallate, that they have
no roome left, for any thing that may
follow, although it bee better. Onely
they inferre, that the goodneſſe of
common poetry, is all one, as well of
that which was written heretofore, as
of that which is now in uſe. But becauſe
my intent is not here to make a
book of the art of poetry, I refer my ſelf
to many ancient, and moderne things,
that have bin exceeding well written
of it, and I will only ſay, that a curious
gentleman, muſt know his proportion
in it, and if he have a vaine in it, having
ſeene, and read much, let him not
governe himſelfe, by his own phanſy,
but by theyrs that endevour to underſtand
him. And in things that are
grave and very ſerious, except he find
them ready, and eaſy, let him not

trouble himſelfe much to reduce them
to harmony. For they, not being very
quaint, doe onely pleaſe him that
makes them, and doe diſpleaſe thoſe
that heare them, Eſpecially if they be
amorous complaints, or of ſuffering
and dying, without knowing how to
end. And therefore poetry that is
made for mirth, and paſtime, is wont
to be well accepted of, and if any ſmall
fault be committed therein, it is eaſilyer
winked at, then if it were in
grave, and ſad matters, as for example
a paſtorall, or thing of pleaſure, that
repreſents (in its colour) ſomething
acted in a Country village; Accordingly
as we have ſeene, many ſonnets,
and pleaſing madrigalls, of which I
will ſet down one for example, which
was made of a Councell held in a Village,
that had purchaſed it ſelfe to be a
Towne, or Corporation.
            
               
                  The Hedge, and Mill, in Councell ſet,
                  Proclaym'd by voyce, of common Cryer.
                  Lord Paſquall, Merin, being met,
                  In judgement, with Paul their Grandſire,
                  They quit Apitius, keeping Swine,
                  
                     Lorenzo charge o're Bacon gave,
                  The Butcher's bound, as with a lyne,
               
               
                  
                  Of Okes, and Ac
                        ••
                     ons, 
                        •
                     are to have.
                  They give each maſſy Braſſe his charge,
                  Out-ruſht, Marke-Gill, the Councell fore,
                  That he o'th pillory at large,
                  Might treate of mending, ere they goe.
                  Then in a rage ſayes Gurca Gill,
                  
                  All's Ordred wel; why prate you still?
               
            
            All ſuch things of mirth, which good
wits have made, for mirth, &amp; paſtime,
doe take much, without prejudice to
his good repute, that in ſuch a rude
ſtyle doth manifeſt his great ability,
and elegancy, And now and then, a
flaſh of this, doth not take ill, like a
good muſician, who what Song ſoever
he ſingeth (though it be ordinary, and
compoſed without art,) can help it,
and by his good voyce, and grace in
ſinging, make it ſhew well. But he that
knowes not how to doe it, yet is confident
in making of verſes, and relying
meerly upon his own skill, ſhall publiſh
his works, to the view of al, ſhal lay
himſelfe open to a publique cenſure.
And ſuch as theſe, when they invite a
friend unto their houſe, they torture
him with their meeters and ſonnets.
And we may all wiſh, to be delivered,
from a worke, or diſcourſe of love,

made in as long as long tedious ſtanzaes:
according as his loſſe or burthē, is great
or preſſing, ſo that all you read in two
houres is but to play at faſt and looſe,
and though thou deſireſt it not, yet
heare it thou muſt, becauſe it is the firſt
time that thou ſaweſt him. They ſay
alſo, that to make verſes reliſh well, we
muſt not look for any meane in them,
as we doe in other things ſo earneſtly,
but extremes. So that they muſt either
be exceeding good, for to pleaſe, or very
bad, to cauſe mirth and laughter.
            2. Of thoſe that are good, as well ancient
as moderne, the books, and writings
of the famous Laureat poets, (to
which I refer the diſcreet Reader) are
ſtuffed full. But for thoſe that are very
bad, of baſe and poore conceipt, there
might well be made a Song-booke, of
the dull headed poets, which would
not be a bad entertaynement, and paſtime,
for the diſcreete ſort, to taſt of,
in paſſing by, as it were, to reliſh their
palates withall.
            3. We have, and may ſee (every day)
the humors of moſt witty men, which
becauſe ſome of them have come to
my hands, I will not (to this purpoſe)
omit, to put a little in this ſallate, and

for our muſicke, it ſhall ſuffice to
touch a falſe ſtring, or (to ſpeake more
properly,) for this enterlude of mirth,
and paſtime.
            One going to Toledo, to enquire about
ſome buſineſſe, an ordinante, preſuming
much of his poetry, ſpake to
the examiner (thinking thereby by
his conceipts to get his good will) in
this manner.
            4. Your worſhip may be pleaſed to
underſtand, that amongſt the variety
of guifts, the Lord hath beſtowed upon
men, he hath bin ſo gracious to me
(although far unworthy) to endue
me with the gift of poetry. So that I
finde the conceipts of poetry, to
ſpring ſo faſt in mee, that they even
treade one another under feete, in
thronging to vent themſelves, and ſom
divine bymnes I have made, (after the
manner of the Church anthemes,)
and thus he began to read the firſt of
them.
            
               Let us rejoyce, let us rejoyce,
               It is meete we ſhould rejoyce,
               Let us rejoyce, let us rejoyce.
            
            And many ſuch things he repeated
in this ſtrayne, which cauſed much

mirth, and pleaſure, to ſee in what
earneſt, and how confidently he ſpake
them. In like manner, another Country
fellow in a Chriſtmas night ſung
in this manner.
            Ay dedeſme la mano peccadores e ſalvaros
he. And the letter of the words
were, Ay peccadores del euerpo garrido
dedeſme le mano y aun in eſcondido, y
ſalvar vos he.
            6. And other things of this nature,
which is not ill paſtime, being repeated
in company, ſo they be but few,
and naturally ſpoken.
            7. He alſo, that cannot frame himſelfe
to poetry, and muſt ſpeake in
proſe, ought not only to take heede, of
ſpeaking incongruous words, but alſo,
that he ſpake not, in a lofty way, and
in the tone of a preacher. For though
there be more maſterſhip, and difficulty,
to preach then to diſcourſe: yet
that muſt bee reſerved for its proper
time, As he that is to paſſe through
the ſtreete, muſt not daunce, but walke
through, as all know. Though it be
granted, that there is more skill, in
dancing then walking, yet for all this,
it would ſhew ridiculous, for a man to
paſſe skipping, or dancing, for ſuch

geſtures, are to be reſerved, for weddings,
and feſtivalls. And in like manner,
muſt thou forbeare, to vary thy
voyce too much in thy diſcourſing.
            8. Take heede alſo that thou avoyd
thoſe that are ever talking, as I have
already ſayd: for there are ſome, that
are ſo pleaſed with their owne diſcourſe,
that when the matter is at an
end, of that which they had to ſay,
yet will they not be ſilent, but will begin
to repeate what they have ſayd,
or ſpeake other impertinencies. And
if any thing be uttered, that they underſtand,
they will take it out of your
mouth, like as one Hen doth ſnatch away
the meate that another Hen carryeth
in her beake.
            9. And ſurely, they cannot chooſe
but diſpleaſe them from whom they
(in this manner) doe take their words.
And nothing ſo ſoone moves a man
to anger, as when before he is aware,
his minde and pleaſure is croſſed, bee
it never ſo little. As if a man have but
lifted up his hand, to throw a ſtone,
and at the inſtant, one behind him
ſhould hold his hand.
            10. All theſe things muſt be avoyded:
but in diſcourſing, we ought rather

to yield to anothers deſire, then
to hinder it. And therefore if any bee
relating, any ſtory, or accident, it is
not good to interrupt him, or to tell
him, thou knoweſt it already: nor as
he is in the middeſt of his ſtory, to mix
any trifles, or jeſts of thine own, with
this diſcourſe, nor (to ſeeme) to tax
his judgement, by upbrayding ſpeeches,
or actions, as wagging the head
or ſquinting, with thine eyes (as many
doe) ſaying thou canſt not endure,
ſuch harſh diſcourſe. Nor in like manner)
to rend as it were a mans
words, from his mouth, being an ill
cuſtome, and is no leſſe diſtaſtfull, then
for a man to be ſtopped by another as
he is running a race. Nor when another
is diſcourſing, ought we to behave
our ſelves, in ſuch ſort, that others that
heare them, be moved to leave them,
and to liſten to ſome new diſcourſe
&amp; gaine that attention to themſelves,
which was before lent to another. For
it is not ſeemly, to diſmiſſe one, whom
thou didſt not invite, but to leave him
to the reſt, to give him attention.
            11. In like manner, thou muſt be attentive
to him that diſcourſes, and
therefore, it is not fitting at every turne

to ſay, how was this, I pray, as many
uſe to doe. Which is as little pleaſing,
to the ſpeaker, as to tread upon a mans
gowne, as he is walking.
            12. So that all this, and generally
all things, that may ſtop, or hinder a
man, to proceede in the diſcourſe he
hath begun, ought to be avoided of us.
And if any be ſlow in his diſcourſe,
thou muſt not be ſo cholerick, to prevent
him, nor to tell him words to expreſſe
himſelfe, although thou be rich,
and abound in language, and the other
be not ſo, for many take this ill: and
eſpecially thoſe that think they know
how to ſpeak well. For they are perſwaded,
you underſtand their ability,
and that you labour to help them, in
their own art. Even as a rich merchant
taketh it for an affront, for another to
offer him mony, as if he needed it, and
were poore and beggarly. And you
muſt know, that every one thinkes, he
knowes how to ſpeake, though modeſty
forbid him to ſay ſo.
            13. And I cannot tell you the reaſon
whence it comes (yet ſo it is) that
thoſe that know leaſt, are the moſt
talkative. So that every one ſhould beware
of much talking, eſpecially if he

know little: for it is a rare thing, for
a man to talke much, and not to commit
many errors, for he that talkes,
ſeemes (in a ſort) to exerciſe ſome ſoveraignty
over his auditours as a maſter
doth over his ſchollars, and it is not
fitting, for a man to aſſume more, then
his ſhare of this ſuperiority.
            14. As much talking is troubleſome,
ſo alſo is much ſilence. For, for a man
alwayes to be ſilent, where others are
diſcourſing, ſhowes they deſire not to
intereſt themſelves (as it were) in paying
of the ſhot, or diſcourſe. And in
this caſe, to ſpeake, is to open the dore,
to entertaine his friendſhip, that
heares thee and on the contrary, to be
ſilent, is to ſhew, that thou deſireſt to be
unknown, and concealed. And ſo, in
this matter of diſcourſing, and of the
extremes thereof, I conclude; deſiring
thee to make uſe of it as a modell and
rule of policy to live in good eſteeme,
As I found it ſtoried in an ancient cronicle,
in this manner. There was in the
Province of Morea, a famous Carver,
called for his great skill, maſter Clariſſimo.
He being now very old, made a
treatiſe, wherein he expreſſed all the
rules, and ſecrets of his art (as being

a man very skilfull) ſetting down,
how to take the dimenſions of the
lymbes of a mans body, that they
might beare a juſt proportion, and
good correſpondency, one with
the other: and this booke hee called
a rule, or direction, by which
booke, according to his directions,
therein conteyned, all the figures,
of mens bodies, which ſhould (from
thenceforth) be made, (by other
maſters) ſhould bee proportioned:
and the more plainely to demonſtrate
his skill, hee made a ſtatue of
fine marble, ſo excellent, and wel
wrought, that it might (well) bee
called, the example of his Booke,
and receive the like name of Regla,
or rule, with it, which (together)
with his Booke, remained for a
perfect patterne, to all the maſter
Gravers, that ſhould ſucceede
him. Now then if perchance it may
bee my good hap, that this little
booke may come to bee a rule and
patterne for a yong man, to imitate,
who deſires to bee pleaſing, and
well reputed of, for his behavioure
it will then ſerve in the place of
the Carvers treatiſe or rule he firſt

made. But for the ſecond rule, or
ſtatue of Marble, which is to put
the firſt rules in practiſe, I cannot
(like that great maſter) leave
you a viſible example. For it is
true, that for the ordering of the
manners, and cuſtomes of people,
it is not enough, to know the art,
and to have a rule, how to carry ones
ſelfe: it is required alſo, to put
them in practiſe, uſe, and cuſtome.
Which cannot bee learnt in a little
time, but requires many yeares, and
by little, and little, &amp; in thoſe things,
that a man hath wholly ſpent his
time in, hee can inſtruct another,
the way, that hee erred in himſelfe.
And ſo thoſe, who have ſtumbeld,
and fallen, doe far better
remember, the deceiptfull, and
doubtfull paths, then thoſe that never
had experience of them.
            16. And if in my tender age, when
the diſpoſition is more tender, and
flexible) I had had one to admoniſh
me, of theſe things, perchance
I ſhould have bin as conſiderate as
I now deſire to make thee to bee.
And you may underſtand, that
though the force of a good nature,

is much, yet for all this, it may bee
altered, and made worſe by ill cuſtome.
And ſo it is convenient, that
againſt this cuſtome, wee oppoſe
good rules, and examples, before
it grow too ſtrong, and obſtinate:
Al en hornar ſe haſen los panes tuertos.
The Ioaves became miſhapen in
the Oven.
            17. This the greater ſort doe not
obſerve, but follow their owne
minde, and pleaſure, and going
whither it invites them, obeying
their naturall inclination, as if reaſon
were an unnaturall thing unto
man. But this reaſon is a powerfull
Lady, and miſtris, to alter the
Ill cuſtomes, and to helpe, and lift up
nature, when ſhee at any time doth
ſtumble or fal. And as we, (for the
moſt part) doe not give eare unto
her, ſo wee may (for the moſt
part) bee fitly ſayd, to reſemble
thoſe living creatures (whom God
hath not given reaſon unto) ſuch
as are brute Beaſts, in whom ſometime
wee may notwithſtanding obſerve
ſome worke of reaſon, but not
of their owne, but ſomething which
wee have taught them, with our reaſon.

As wee may obſerve in horſes,
who naturally are wilde, and fierce,
and yet, every maſter of them
makes them gentle, and well conditioned,
(more or leſſe) according
to his skill, or experience, for
wee ſee many of them having an
uncomly trot, are taught by man,
to goe a ſmooth, and eaſy amble,
and to ſtand quietly, to runne, to
prance and bound, and all this they
learne, and are therein ſubject, to our
will, and reaſon.
            18. If then, the horſe, the dog,
and the birds, and many other
Creatures, (though much fiercer
then theſe) doe ſubmit themſelves
to the reaſon of another, and doe
obey it, and profit ſo farre thereby,
(A thing which by nature they
know not, but were utterly repugnant
thereto) that they become ſo
ready, and uſefull, not by nature,
but meerly by cuſtome: how much
more ought man, to believe, that
hee ſhall much advantage himſelfe,
by the rules, and documents, that
are drawne from our owne reaſon,
if wee will give care unto them. But
ſenſuall men love preſent delight,

and avoyde that, which troubles
them, and detaynes them from it.
They doe not therefore reject reaſon,
becauſe they thinke it bitter,
the truth being, that they
eſteeme it in the firſt place; nor is
the hurtfull pleaſure, (oftentimes)
but even that which is good, noyſome
and offenſive to the depraved,
and ſubdued palate; for while wee
live, according to ſenſe, we are like
a ſicke man, to whom all foode,
though it bee ſweete, and pleaſant,
reliſhes ill, and ſeemes naught:
and hee finds fault with every one,
that giveth it unto him, though the
fault be not in the Meate, but the
bitterneſſe hee feeles is in his owne
tongue; ſo that hee taſtes not the
goodneſſe, and ſweetneſſe of the
Meate. So reaſon, which of it ſelfe
is ſweete, ſeems bitter unto us,
more by our diſtemper, then that
(in it ſelfe) it is ſo indeed, and being
tender, and delicate, we eſteeme
it not, but doe diſſemble, and
cloake our owne errors and weakeneſſe,
objecting, that there are no
ſpurres, no bridle, ſufficient, to
governe our naturall inclinations.

And ſurely, if wee ſhould meete
with Oxen, or other unreaſonable
creatures, they could not affoord us
a worſe ſentence, nor more ſenceleſſe
then this. Wee then at ripe
yeares, yea in old age it ſelfe would
continue to be like yong men, were
it not, that reaſon (that encreaſeth
in us with our yeares) doth turne
us from beaſtes, unto men. And
thereby it prevaileth above our ſenſes,
and appetite; and ſo is it our
owne fault, and our owne neglect,
and not our nature, that makes us
culpable in this kinde.
            14. Except wee can blame her,
by way of mirth, as a witty Italian
once did, upon the ſtage, before a
great auditory, after this manner,
Dame nature erred, in placing a
mans legges the wrong way, upon
his body: for the Calves, and
the heeles, which ſhould have bin
ſet foremoſt, were ſet behind; by
reaſon whereof, as a man walkes,
hee doth often breake his ſhins,
and hurt his Toes, (which is a
great paine to him) which hee
could not have done, if the Calfe
of the Legge had ſtood formoſt,

but eſpecially, in going up a paire
of theyrs, our feete ſtanding that
way, doe often make us ſtumble,
and fall. A man ought alſo to have
had a doore made in his belly, to
open and ſhut, that when hee ſhould
bee coſtive, or bound in his belly,
hee might open it, and unſtop the
paſſage, and waſh his Guts, and
then there would bee no neede, to
ſet ſuch battering gliſter cannons
againſt the poſtern, nor to make uſe
of ſo many medicinall Bullets, as
are uſed to force the paſſage open.
            20. And it might (likewiſe)
ſerve, that gallants might not coſen
their miſtreſſes, but, that when they
profeſſe to them, in this manner,
my faire miſtreſſe, I here within mee
doe carry engraven in my heart,
your curious portraiture, ſhee might
(then) preſently open the doore,
and goe in, and ſee, whether hee
ſpake true or no, and then they
durſt not be ſo bould, to lie ſo incredibly,
as they now uſually doe, unto
their miſtreſſes.
            21. But leaving theſe fooleries,
and returning to our purpoſe, I

ſay, it is falſe, and perverſe to
maintaine there is no bridle can reſtraine
nature, nor maſter that can
tutor her. For we have ſeene (formerly)
that there are two things
that can order her; the firſt is cuſtome,
and the other is reaſon; and
that cuſtome muſt not thwart, that
which is in uſe amongſt us. For this
uſe or cuſtome is the ſonne and heyre
of our times.
            22. Therefore wee ought, from
our very youth, to beginne to
learne to bee of a good diſpoſition,
firſt, becauſe then a man
hath moſt time to learne, and to
ſhew it; And ſecondly, becauſe
that age (being tender, pure, and
incorrupt,) doth eaſily receive
any colour: and in like manner,
the things a man learneth in his
youth, are ſeldome forgotten:
but ſticke by us as long as wee
live.
            23. But beſides this, we are to conſider,
that men are paſſionate, upon
beauty, handſomneſſe, and good
proportion, and on the contrary
they are enemies to foulneſſe, and
things extremly ugly. And this

is one eſpeciall priviledge, which irrationall
Creatures are not partakers
of. For they cannot diſtinguiſh
betweene beauty, and deformity.
And therefore, as a thing which
is not common, with the beaſts,
but onely proper to us; wee ought
to value it, and eſteeme it, much
in it ſelfe; and much more, thoſe
that are endowed with better underſtanding,
as being thoſe, that
are more capable to underſtand it:
And though wee cannot preciſely
deſcribe, what beauty properly is,
nor in what it punctually conſiſts,
yet for all that, (that thou mayſt
know ſomething of her,) I deſire
you to know; that where you
finde a decent proportion of the
parts, having relation to themſelves,
in particular, and to the
whole in generall, this is beauty;
and that thing, where this comly,
and good proportion is found, 
                  •
               s
a perfect and beautifull thing.
Which is the greateſt beauty, that
can bee imagined, as I have bin
taught, by a very learned man; even
ſo as thou mayeſt behold in
the faces of brave, and gallant Ladies

For the forme of each of
whoſe faces it ſeemes each part of
them hath bin made by the patterne
of ſome one excellent face,
on purpoſe to make them exquiſite,
which ſeemes not ſo in ill favored
faces, but the contrary, namely
to bee many ugly parts, taken from
ſeverall ugly faces, to make them
the more deformed. For put caſe,
that an ill favoured Lady have
great, and goggle eyes, a ſmall
and thin Noſe, hollow Cheekes▪ a
pouch mouth, a long chin, an ill
complexion; you would thinke,
that this face, was not made by one
face, but taken out of many, and
made of ſeverall pieces, which
you cannot thinke of a well featured
face, as I have already could
you.
            24. It may be, that famous Painter
that made all the beautifull Virgins
of Calabria, come naked before him,
did nothing elſe, but view the good
proportions, that many of them
had taken from one excellent creature,
(ſome of them having one
part excellent, others another) and
made them (every of them) reſtore

that which they had thus
robbed her of, whom hee was to
draw. For that the beauty of Venus
was to bee ſuch, as a Creature
made up, of ſuch ſeverall, rare, and
exquiſite parts, would be.
            25. I would not have you thinke,
that this is to be underſtood onely,
of the beauty of good faces, and
comely proportion, of the body.
But it falls out in ſpeaking, and
in action, neither more nor leſſe
then, as if thou ſhouldeſt finde a
noble, and brave Lady, very hanſome,
waſhing of cloathes, at a
brooke, in the open ſtreete, though
for any thing elſe, ſhee offends thee
not: yet even this, thou ſeeſt her
doing, will make thee loath her,
becauſe ſhe ſhewes not her ſelfe, one
and the ſame ſhee appeared, but
divers, and her originall, condition
and eſtate, is ſuch, as belong to a
neate and noble Dame, But her
workes, belong to a vile, and
poore conditioned woman. And
though there come from her, no
ill ſent, or favour, nor any ill noiſe,
nor hath ſhe an ill complexion nor
doth any way offend any of thy

ſences: yet will this unſutable action,
baſe comportment, and vile
worke (ſo unſutable to her condition)
bee very unpleaſing to
thee.
            26. Thou muſt therefore, take
heede of all things that are unſutable
to thee, as of ſuch like diſagreeing
manners, and behaviour:
But with greater care, and circumſpection,
that thou give no example
of ſcandall, to any by
thy actions: but eſpecially take
heede of ſuch things as I have
tould you of: for it is more
hard, to know when one erreth in
ſuch things, then in other: for it
is true, that the ſence is more
active then the underſtanding. Yet
nevertheleſſe, it falls out, (many
times) that that very thing, that
diſtaſts the ſences, doth alſo diſpleaſe
the underſtanding: but this
is not by the ſame occaſion, but
by divers, as I ſayd before, when
I ſhewed you, that a wiſe man
muſt cloath himſelfe, according to
the faſhion of other men, and
not according to his owne humour;
that hee may not ſhew, that hee deſires

to reprove, and amend others:
which (to moſt men) is a hatefull
thing, to thoſe who deſire
to bee commended. It doth in like
manner, offend the judgment, of
underſtanding men, and therefore
a man ought not onely to bee contented,
to doe things, that are
good, but hee muſt endevour, to
doe them bravely, and comly. And
this bravery or gallantry, is nothing
elſe, but a luſtre, that proceedes
from the conveniency, and
conformity of thoſe things, that,
are well compoſed, without which
comlineſſe, even a good thing, is
not faire, nor is the beauty thereof
acceptable.
            27. And even as meate, though
it bee good, and wholeſome, if it
have no reliſh, will not pleaſe the
palate: ſo is it ſomtimes in the
manners of men, which though in
themſelves they bee not hurtfull,
nor dangerous, yet are they (nevertheleſſe)
ſimple, and bitter: except
grace, and bravery, be added
to them, or that which wee here
call pleaſantneſſe. For which reaſon,
every one muſt needs diſpleaſe

by committing of faults, and
errors, becauſe he doth things that
agree not together, and ſo ſettled, &amp;
reſerved diſpoſitions, doe take diſlike
at their diſagreement, or unſutableneſſe.
So that hee that would be pleaſing
to the people, in his cariage, muſt
fly all vices; but thoſe eſpecially,
which are moſt brutiſh, or Beaſtly: as
are luxury, covetouſneſſe, cruelty,
and the like, ſome of which are baſe,
as namely to bee a glutton, or a
drunkard, both of which (for
the evill property of them) are rejected
and abhorred, of moſt men,
as being things diſhonourable. But
becauſe wee are not, (heere) to
treate of the nature of vices, or
vertues, but onely of pleaſing, and
diſpleaſing manners, and neglects,
into which people doe fall, as
was that of count Ricardo, and others,
of whom I have ſpoken, I
will not dwell upon them. It is
onely my intent to ſpeake of that,
which civill and well faſhioned
people muſt obſerve, which is,
to bee carefull to keepe this beauty,
and good proportion, of the things
I have told them of. Which wee

muſt make uſe of, in our wordes, and
works, in going, ſtanding ſtill, in ſitting,
and carrying our ſelves, in our
cloathing, in our ſpeech, and in
houlding our peace, and in our
ſleeping, and (generally) in what
ever wee ſay, or doe. And this I
finde to bee the reaſon, why a
man muſt not cloath himſelfe like
a woman, becauſe his perſon muſt
not bee of one kinde, and his habit
of another: as ſome doe, that
criſp their hayre, with hot irons, and
lick their faces over, with a painting
waſh.
            28. Nor ſhould a man bee either
beaſtly, or elſe perfumed, for
one is proper for a boore, and the
other for an effeminate body; but
it is beſt, for a Gentleman, to
ſmell of nothing either good, or ill:
this being indeede the beſt kinde of
neateneſſe.
            29. Sometimes hee may uſe
this curioſity, by meanes of ſome
rich perfumed gloves, which hee
weares, in a careleſſe way. But
that which doth pleaſe him beſt,
that reckons himſelfe for a Gallant,
is to have his Linen ſprinkled,

with ſweete waters, and to have his
black Cloake or Gowne, very fine,
and cleane bruſhed. Which things
hee that may, yet will not have
them, offends the ſight of his friend,
for ſlovenlineſſe is a vice, and neatneſſe
a vertue, as was well ſayd,
by a grave Arch-Biſhop of Granado,
to his Chaplaine, who thinking
to get the Biſhops favour, and
ſo bee the ſooner preferred by him,
diſtinguiſht himſelfe, from the other
Chaplaines, by his beaſtly
and ſlovenly going, as with his
necke bare, without any appearance
of a Shirt, and his head
hanging in his boſome. The wiſe
Arch-Biſhop, finding his hypocriſy,
ſayd unto him, Father, this
is not holineſſe, but naſtineſſe; goe
neate; and cleanely, or elſe you
get nothing of mee. It would conſequently
have pleaſed this prelate,
as ill, to ſee in his ſervants
ſuch extreame curioſity and niceneſſe
and tricking, that many uſe,
ſtraightning their Neckes ſo with
their Collers, that if they bee to
turne their Heades, on one ſide,
they cannot doe it, but they are

forced, to turne their whole bodies,
and by their trimmings, and embroderies,
their cloathes cannot
bee diſtinguiſhed, from the cloathes,
which the gallant Ladies weare.
And ſo, all diſproportion doth ill
become: As on the contrary, it
beſeemes not a pleaſing Courtier,
to goe poorely, or ſlovenly or careleſſely,
attyred: never taking care,
to button his Doublet, or to bee
trimmed, or to goe in thrid-bare
or torne Garments. To this purpoſe
it is ſtoryed of a Lords yonger
ſonne, Unto whom his Parents never
gave any cloathes, but ſuch
as his elder brother had left off,
that both of them falling ſicke, and
Chickens being provided for them
to eate, at the meale time the
tendereſt Chicken was made
choyce of for his elder brother:
the yonger brother ſeeing it, ſpake
thus to his Parents, How comes
it to paſſe, that I muſt have the
tough Chicken, and the tender
cloathes? And for this ſpeech, hee
was ſo eſteemed, and got the favour
of his Parents ſo much, that ever
after that, they gave him as good

cloathes as his elder Brother.
            30. The cloathes as wee have
ſayd, muſt bee according to the
faſhion that others of thy age doe
weare their garments in, and in the
company of the grave Nobility,
plumes, and ſpringgs, (ſuch as Souldiers
weare in the Warres) are not
ſeemely, to bee worne, nor Embroideries,
and laced Garments;
much leſſe armes, or buffe Coates,
which onely in the Warre, doe
ſhew well. For the curious Cavaleeres,
and Souldiers, that are courtly;
when they are in the Cities, or
Court, they lay aſide their bravery
and they bee ſuch Souldiers (for
the moſt part) that never were out
of the Land, or in the Warres,
that doe uſe to flant it, in this manner.
And in Cities, and among
quiet people, thoſe that goe armed,
(uſually) and with plumes in their
Hats, are not pleaſing, for they
are like Nettles, or ſtinking weeds,
in a Garden of ſweete Herbes, and
Flowers. And ſo are ill accepted
of, by the Citizens, being diſtinguiſhed
from them, in their
habits.
            
               
31. An honourable perſon muſt
not runne through the ſtreet, nor
make much haſt, like him that goes
of an errand, which is fitter for
Lackayes, and footmen, then for
people of worth to doe: and beſides
this, they make themſelves
ſweete, and put themſelves out of
breath, to no purpoſe, there being
no neceſſity for them to doe
it.
            32. Yet ought not one to goe ſo
ſoftly, and ſlowly, as Women, nor
ſo ſoberly, as a Bride; nor when
hee walketh in haſt, to goe wreathing
his body, or looke ſmilingly upon every
body, like little girles.
            33. Nor to lift up both his hands,
clutched together, or to thruſt out
his Armes, which is, as if a man,
were going to ſowe Corne with
them.
            34. Some in their going lift up
their feete like Horſes, that ſtart:
and doe laſh out their Legges as
farre as if they drew them out of
the midſt of a Cheſt, or ſome
deepe Veſſell: ſome drawle their
Feete ſo, upon the ground, that a
Cart makes but a little more noiſe,

then they doe: and ſome there bee,
that eaſt one Foote out from them,
ill favouredly, and others that rubbe
one Legge againſt another, or goe
ſhaking and in a dancing faſhion;
all which things, are unſeemly,
and diſpleaſing. For if (by chance)
thy Horſe goes with his mouth open,
or ſhew his tongue, though
it take not from his goodneſſe,
yet for all this hee is the leſſe worth,
for this ill favoured quality: if then
bravery, and neatneſſe, bee eſteemed
ſo much, in unreaſonable creatures,
and even in things without
ſenſe, as for example, two houſes
built in one place, and with one
charge, if one of them bee more
comly and more pleaſant then the
other, it is therefore accompted
more worth: how much more then
this beauty, and neatneſſe is valued,
by men, it is eaſy from hence to
be underſtood.
            35. It is not good, when thou
art at the Table, to ſcratch thy ſelfe;
and a man muſt at that time, forbeare
to ſpit; and if hee bee forced
to doe it, it is ſeemely, for
him to doe it, very concealedly.

I have heard one ſay, hee hath ſeene
a people, that doe never ſpit, therefore
we may well forbeare it for a little
ſpace.
            36. Wee ought alſo, to beware
of taking our Meate ſo greedily, that
by that meanes, there be cauſed
belching or any other unpleaſing
act, like as thoſe doe, who make
ſo much haſt, that they are forced, to
fetch their breath ſtrongly, and to
puffe, and blow, with trouble to all
the company.
            37. Nor muſt wee wipe our Teeth
with our Napkin, or with our Finger,
nor waſh our mouth, and ſo ſpit out
the waſhing thereof, that all may ſee
thee.
            38. Nor after we are riſen from
the Table, to ſtand with a picktooth,
in our mouth, or any other
inſtrument wee uſe to make them
cleane withall: like a Bird, that is carrying
ſtrawes, or ſtickes to her neaſt;
nor to ſtick them in our eares, like a
Barber.
            39. And hee that hath a clenſer
for his Teeth, hanging about his
necke, let him not draw it out; for
beſides that it is ſtrange, to ſee a

Gentleman, draw out of his boſome,
an inſtrument, belonging to
a Tooth-drawer, it argues him,
(alſo) to have much thought of his
belly. And according as hee weares
this, hee may as well alſo weare a
Spoone about his neck.
            40. Wee ought not, to leane with
our Elboes, or Armes, upon the
Table: nor to ſtuffe our mouthes,
with Meate, ſo full, that our
Cheekes, may bee ſwollen (thereby)
like a Bag-pipers, nor to ſhew
any action, by which wee may
make it appeare, to another, that
the Meate pleaſeth us very much,
or the Wine, which is the faſhion
of vintners, and of pratling Drunkards:
nor to call to them, that
are at the Table, in this manner;
you eate nothing to day, or heere
is nothing you can eate, I pray
eate of this. Which (mee thinkes)
is not fitting, though hee thou haſt
invited, bee one of thy kindred,
or very familiar friend: for though
thereby, it ſeemes thou haſt a care
of him, yet many times, it is an
occaſion, that thy Gueſt cannot
uſe his owne liberty, in his dyet,

and ſo may get hurt thereby. And
therefore I hould it not fitting,
to offer another any thing, that
thou haſt upon thy Trencher, except
thou bee a farre better man,
then hee: ſo that, hee that receives
it, may take it, for an
honour done unto him. For amongſt
equalls, hee that thus offers
it, ſeemes to make himſelfe
better then him, to whom hee offers
it; and it may offend him,
that the other ſhould thus (ſeeme
to) undervalue him. Yet notwithſtanding
this, thou muſt not refuſe,
or returne, that which hee preſents
thee withall, that thou mayſt not
ſeeme, to take it ill, or to finde
fault with him.
         
         
            
            CHAPTER, 15. Of Compotations or Drinkings.
            An invitation to drinking by
a ſtrange word, wee call Brindis,
which is to Drinke a
health to one; of it ſelfe, it is an
ill, and clowniſh faſhion; and
though ſome (in our Country,)
doe uſe it, and entertaine it, yet
wee ought to avoyd it; and if any
invite thee to it, thou mayſt refuſe
his invitation, and acknowledge thy
weakneſſe, giving him thankes, and
accepting friendly the Wine, without
Drinking it.
            Theſe Drinkings, or Healthes
(for ſo wee may interpret them)
are ſayd to have bin much uſed (of
old) in ſome parts of Greece,
where I have herd ſay, there have
bin ſome, that were very famous
for this manner of Drinking: it
is ſayd of a famous man, of that
time, called Socrates, that hee ſat
up bouldly, a whole Night, to

Drinke with a famous Drinker,
called Ariſtophanes: and the next
morning, hee drew a curious Geometricall
figure, without miſſing
a hayre, in its true proportion,
whence you may gather, the Wine
had not ſtirred him: and the reaſon
was, becauſe hee had ſo much
uſed to adventure himſelfe, in
this bould way of Drinking. And
though many ſhew their ſtrength,
in drinking much, and uſe to drinke
for wagers, that they will not bee
made drunke, yet wee ought to accompt
of their victories, if they win
but as of an infectious vice, and a
brutiſh ſin.
            3. Shew not thy ſelfe troubled,
at any thing thou canſt not helpe,
and if thou repenteſt of any thing
thou haſt done, let no body know
it, That none may diſcover thy
weakeneſſe; Yet by way of mirth,
I will tell you a Jeſt that befell a
Gallant, and it was not an ill one,
of whom it is ſayd, That being
deſired (by a Lady,) to come
to a tilting in blew cloathing, hee
promiſed to doe it, but becauſe
hee had no mony, nor other

thing to provide himſelfe this livery
withall, hee ſould a More
that hee highly eſteemed, and having
worn his blew cloathes, and
being afterwards ſorry for the error,
he had committed, His More broke
this jeſt upon him, of blacke comes
blew.
            None ought to put off his
Cloathes before another, eſpecially
his ſhoes: for it may fall out,
that the partes of thy body, which
ſhould bee hid, may bee diſcovered,
to thy ſhame, and his, that
ſees it. Nor muſt thou combe thy
Head, or waſh thy Hands, before
people of worth, but thou muſt
doe them in private, in thy lodging,
and not in publike, excepting
that waſhing of the Handes,
may bee done before any Body,
when thou art to ſit downe, to
thy Meate, for in that caſe, though
one bee cleane already, yet ought
every one then to waſh, that he that
eateth with him, may have aſſurance
of his cleanelineſſe, nor muſt
thou come before company, with
the Cap thou weareſt a nights,
or with thy night geere on, or come

out, tying or untying it, nor to
ſpeake to any thou ſeeſt in thy
Houſe, in the manner as many
uſually doe. O ſir, pray ſtay there
a little; nor is it a good faſhion at
night to dreſſe thy ſelfe, or to
binde up thy Head, as I have ſeene
ſome doe, with as great curioſity,
as if they were Women: except there
bee ſome extraordinary neceſſity for
it.
            4. A new married Gentleman,
uſed this curioſity, who being a
ſmooth faced youth, without a
Beard, being with his Wife, in his
Chamber, a meſſenger came in thither,
to looke for him, that had
a meſſage to deliver to him: and
being there, and ſeeing them both
ſo trimmed up, and one as well as
the other, without a Beard, hee
asked, which of their Worſhips
was the Gentleman to whom hee
was ſent to, that hee might not
bee miſtaken in his meſſage? then
the Husband put off his Nightgeere,
and reſolved, no more to
put it on, till hee ſhould have a
Beard.
            5. There bee ſome, that hold

it for great ingenuity, often, to
wreath their mouthes into divers
faſhions, to rowle and glance with
their eyes, to ſwell their Cheekes,
like Bagpipes, to ſtand puffing,
and blowing, and making of variety
of Faces: and ſome others
there bee that are ſo diſcompoſed
when they doe ſome certaine things,
that they put out their tongues,
almoſt a hand-breadth, as they are
in doing it: theſe ſhould altogether
avoyde the doing of ſuch
things: as it is ſtoryed of the goddeſſe
Pallas, who was ſometimes
delighted in playing on the Cornet,
till it happened, that (one
day) playing thereon, for her
pleaſure, by a Fountaine ſide,
ſhee beheld her ſelfe in the water,
and beholding thoſe new &amp; ſtrange
faces, which ſhee muſt neceſſarily
make, while ſhee played, was aſhamed
of her ſelfe, and preſently
broke the Cornet, in pieces. And
indeede, it was well done of her,
it not being an inſtrument, fitting
for Ladies, nor yet for men, except
for thoſe that make it their
profeſſion. And that which ſhewes

ill in the Face does as bad in the
reſt of the Members, and therefore
it becomes not a man, to
ſhew his Teeth, except hee laugh,
nor much to ſcratch the Beard, or
to rubbe one Hand againſt another,
nor to ſigh much, or to ſeeme
much diſcontented, and to complaine
of his misfortune as many
doe, more out of a cuſtome they
have gotten, then for any juſt occaſion
they have to doe it. Or to
ſtand ſtretching, or rowſing up
himſelfe: nor to cry out, woe,
woe unto mee, as I have ſeene
ſome to doe. Nor is it good to
make a noyſe with the mouth, in
token, that wee wonder at, or diſlike
any thing: or to counterfeit
a foule matter, for things counterfeit
are not very farre differing
from truth. One ought not to
laugh ſleepily making ugly Faces,
or to laugh more for cuſtome then
neceſſity. Nor muſt thou bee much
taken with thine owne ſpeech, or
geſtures, which is to commend
thy ſelfe, for laughter belongs to
him that is a hearer, and not a
ſpeaker. Thou muſt then take care

of the cariage of thy body, eſpecially
when thou ſpeakeſt, for it falls out,
that ſome are ſo beſotted upon their
owne diſcourſe, that they regard
nothing elſe. And ſome there are,
that wag their Heades, or turne their
eyes or ſhrinke up their eye browes,
to the midle of their foreheads, or
elſe let them (skowlingly) hang
downe over their eyes. And ſome
there are, that make wry mouthes,
others that ſpit, and even ſprinkle
their Faces, with whom they diſcourſe;
you may finde others, that
uſe ſuch action, and quick motion
with their Hands, as they talke that
you would thinke, they were driving
Flyes away, all which cuſtomes,
are very offenſive. And as Pindar
ſaith, every thing that is done ſweetly
and reliſheth well, is performed
in a free, and conformable way.
What then may I ſay of him, that
goes into company, with a Pen in
his Eare, or a ruler in his Mouth, or
of him, that layes one legge upon
the Table, or that ſpits betweene
his Fingers? and of innumerable other
ſottiſh cricks, which men may
by obſervation finde to bee uſed?

concerning which I heere intend
not to enlarge my ſelfe, becauſe I
know there be many, will ſay, I have
ſayd farre too much. And ſo I conclude,
giving thee to underſtand,
that thou muſt not thinke that of
theſe little things one can make but
a ſmall fault, but that by many little
ones, a great one may at laſt bee
committed. And that the leſſe they
are, the more care thou hadſt neede
to take to leave them, becauſe they
are ſo hardly diſcerned, nor doth
he that doth them conſider, that like
as ſmall 
                  Ʋnthrifty expences, which
by their continuance doe conſume
our eſtates before we are aware of
them; Even ſo doe theſe little faults,
by their great number, ſpoile our
good behaviour. Therefore they being
of ſo great moment, wee
ought not to make ſport
of them.
