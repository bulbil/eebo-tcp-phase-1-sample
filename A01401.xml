            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  TO The Right Honorable Countesse Dowager of DERBIE.
                  
                     RIGHT HONORABLE;
                  
                  
                     
                        EXperience maketh Ignorance confesse, that the best composed priuate Letters resemble the passage of a Shippe, leauing no print or impression of her course: and the mememorie of such an improuident and vnfortunate Man as my selfe, is like spilt abroad Water, neuer to be gathered vp againe.—But doe what Contempt and Greatnesse can: this shall outlast a Tombe, and be more glorious then the proudest Epitaph or Structure: Not that there is any thing in the same, otherwise then a Spiders Cobwebbe, fitter to be swept away with a huswiuely hand: But because your Fame may suruiue thereby, and many ages to come demaund, which Lady of DERBY excited such commemoration? And then the answere shall bee; Earle Ferdinandos Widow, Countesse

DOWAGER of DERBY; who was thus farre beholding to Nature, that Loue, Beauty, and Comlinesse, exposed her as a worke of her choycest Storehouse: who was so farre beholding to Vertue, that shee vnited many Graces, as you see a rich Diamond augmented in his lusture by the workmans skilfulnesse: who was so farre beholding to Fortune, that shee sheltred vnder the couert of the greatest and magnificenst Prince in the World Q. Elizabeth; and shee so ouermantled her with Fauour, that King Iames kept her still glorious vnder the same: Who was so farre beholding to Prouidence, that from a second Husbands Worthinesse and Wisedome, they went arme in arme to the house of Perfection, and made it thriue the better vnder the warm: roofe of Aboundance: Who was so farre beholding to Honour▪ 
                     that shee affronted the strictnesse of Law, and from his Maisties Warrant kept her greatnesse secure: and who was so farre beholding to Fame, that shee trode vpon the swelling Serpent Enuie, and raysed good wishes from their hearts, who had formerly pretended cause of distasting.
                  
                  
                     Therefore I can be no contrary amongst so many iuditious obseruers, but presume, that so great goodnesse will not be diuerted by any maligne circumstances; and assure my selfe, that your Honour may looke toward mee with a gracious aspect, or at least in this triuiall abruptnesse condiscend to a charitable endurance of mens imperfections: For Wisedome, or a thriuing Fortune is not bought in the Market, and I amongst some others may well complaine,—Fato prudentia minor.
                  
                     Your Honours humble Obseruant,
Th. Gainsforde.

                     SO long continued the fight betwixt the valiant Anzitemus, 
                     The Battaile betwixt Anzitemus and Cleonidas at Sea. and the Arch-pirat Cleonidas, that extremitie wondred to be maintained, and the night (as a common decider of Controuersies) hasted for very pittie to determine the furie, not remembring what terrour her haste would adde vnto the furie: whereupon Anzitemus enraged to be disappoynted, commaunded to grapple, and the taske imposed, chained their Barkes togeather; the effect whereof, produced the lamentable Stratagems, wherewith Confusion, Slaughter, and Death, terrifieth the beholders: For the fighters with Swords seemde to play in the choyse either to deuide the Body

from the Head, or seperate the Members from the Body: Such as vsed Pikes, might either wound or kill; such as throw Stones, either braine, or endanger; &amp; such as trusting to their strength durst cloose, either strangle, or tosse ouerboard: Thus were some throwne into the Sea, some stifled in the Shippes, some slaine outright, some irrecouerably wounded, some thronged to death, some sprauling halfe dead, &amp; some fainting ouerweatied; none escaping one mischiefe or other; and all confounded, because they saw all things confused: the faythlesse hearted trembling before death, as dismayed at their fellowes outcryes: the valiant hoping to liue to reuenge their companions wrongs: At last, Destruction lifted vp her horrible countenaunce, as if shee meant to distract them with this assurance, that neither Pollicie, nor Endeuours could direct to any way of securitie; which when Anzitemus (euen betwixt the contraries of Pittie and Rage) apprehended, hee then cryed out: Let all cease, and Cleonidas and I determine the controuersie.
                  But, whether Cleonidas despayring in the successe, stomaked the misfortune, or remembring his fault conceited the reuenge; or impatient at the difficultie, forgate the meanes of redresse; or enraging to be ouer-mastered, became absolutely desperate: Hee put in practise more feare A dèsperate action of Cleonidas. and more terrour: with his owne hands like a hired Seruant of mischiefe setting the Ships on

fire, and commaunding the rest of his partie to heaw them a peeces, or otherwise to shift for themselues. This was so well liked of the Mariners, and so soone performed, that you would haue imagined, Confusion meant to decipher, with what varietie shee would entertaine Death: For what with Axes, Hat-chets, Sawes, Dragges, Winches, Croes, Engines, and other Instruments: the Shippes were splitted, spoyled, broken, disioynted, and all to peeces shiuered: besides, the Fire playing the Tirant, quickly disseuered, what before fastned the maine Beames togeather; herein onely acting the part of a Friende by soone ridding out of the paine, and concluding (seen we must die) to die with resolution.
                  
                  Thus were such interdicted with necessitie of sauing them selues, who before striued to intercept others: Thus did vncomfortable Cryes condemne the crueltie of Reuenge; which would not be satisfied without so small a massacre: Thus were pittifull yelles the last testimonie, how many hundreds exclaymed on the ambition of men: Thus did horrible Curses sound out the wicked mindes of such, as neglected the true vse of a good Conscience: Thus were all the causes of amazement vnited, to shew the formidable effectes of Enrage &amp; Despight, so that the most part perished, and very few summoned vp new hopes to prolong their liues: Yet had Anzitemus this fortune, to light on the hinder quarter of his

enemies Shippe; and if before affrighted with the hideous spectacle hee stood vncapable of any The Shipwracke of Anzitemus. resolution, now reduced with the enforced conditions of life, he bestirred his consideration to inhibit vnkind and vntimely mischaunce: wherevpon compelled to leaue the ornaments of his vallour, because he was to make vse of his armes and lightnesse, he quickly stripped himselfe, and as quickly tooke vp his seate on the broken peece, which resembling some Boigh or Sea marke, was no doubt the occasion he was the better marked. For as the vncomfortable Night finished her progresse, the bountie of a sunshining Morning layde open her treasurie, and hee had the choyce of many seuerals; faire Weather, sweet

and greater Cattell to the Downes, which were in a manner purged by the gentle ebbings &amp; flowings of the Sea; where both one and other seemed to make vse of a pleasing theft, pleasing to the Beastes in finding so good a pray as the sweete Grasse affoorded; pleasing to the Earth, in being ordained an instrument of such reliefe: the effect whereof produced, that Riches without Enuie, Good order without Flatterie, Quietnesse without Imperfection, Peace without Intemperance, Plenty without Inordinatnesse, Encrease without Repining, and all other blessings of the Land, as it were in one league combined them selues: Besides, the Sea disbursed a recompence to their industry, which caused them to maintaine certaine Boates to fish with, and euery one according to a well applauded custome watched his course: amongst these Placandus (whom yeeres &amp; grauitie had much graced) liued with such loue and liking, that whensoeuer his iourney importuned, some Placandus fishing night. one or other attended the worke in hand, and at this instant bare him company in his fishingnight: so that by Art vnited to industrie (the onely enemies of idlenesse) their nets were filled with great store, and their Trunks stored with excellent Fish, the dispatch whereof (as vnwilling to tempt prosperitie with an vnnecessary iourney) concluded a returne, had not a sudden cry directed their pittie to regard what they heard, and that detained them to consider, how they might administer

reliefe, the rather because a man appeared sitting on a broken piece of a Shippe, neither much dissmayed at so great an enemie as death, nor now seeming ouer ielous for so sweete a friend as Life: But such as hee was, did their industry assist, their assistance helpe, their helpe recouer, their recouery welcome to Comfort: now when Comfort came to act her part, like the Sunne, who scorning to be checked with euery slender Vapour, quickly lifteth vp his glorious head: Feare and palenesse was made ashamed of their wrong disseisure, and he seemed the very Sonne of Valoure, and darling of loue.
                  This at the first, raysed a kind of reuerence, wherein they would more orderly haue proceeded, had not a pleasing vtterance pacefied their importunities Anzitemus saued by Placandus changeth hisname to Montanus to vnderstande, who hee might be with his earnest desire to take him as hee was, which (sayth hee) I cannot but presume on, because I finde such a vnitie of goodnesse: Bee therefore satisfied, that my simple trueth telleth you, I am Montanus of Carberia, vnfortunate in being that I am; and ten times vnfortunate in remembring what I was: meane I confesse, but now the meaner by loosing all meanes of my estate and liuing, as hauing with some substaunce and friends not eighteene dayes since burdoned one small Barke, and after some varietie of Stormes within these eighteene howers tasted the very bitternesse of aduersitie, which many with the meditation

put me in minde of some misfortune: But thinges remedilesse, are past care and cure; therefore I will teach my tongue to forget her owne language, and ouermaster Misery with an ill respected Vertue called Patience.
                  But Placandus tooke an other course, and from troubling him with any more questions, applyed the ordynary meanes of helpe in such cases, telling that they were men of Husbandrie and Cattle in the Kingdome of Nagania, and not Fishers; if then their supplyes could stand him in stead, or estates induce him to be one of the companie, hee might be sure neither to fayle of succour, nor complaine for want: and if my selfe seeme not lesse worthy then another, I will welcome thee, and vpon good deseruing, adde to thy welcome, a reward,
                  By this time, had Montanus youth shewed a scorne of the mischiefe, which the Seaes vnmercisulnesse pretended, and hee remained in some extasie, remembring his owne affayres, but especially, that in so remote a place, hee must represent the fruite of a foraine Land, which the Inhabitants haue no other vse of, but wondring at: Yet hoping to spende out the extreamitie of sullen conceites with this varietie, and perceiuing the rest as it were to stomacke his slacknesse, that apprehended no sooner the curtesie proposed, he presently opened the treasurie of the poore, thanked all in generall, and gratified Placandus
                     
in particular, accepting the kindnesse with many wishes, that his honest endeuours might draw on successe to confirme him a dutifull seruant.
                  Thus they returned with effectuall dispatch of their iorney, and extraordinary newes of this aduenture, which ouer a day or two, was willing to participate it selfe to the rest: Yet not in so slender a manner, but euery one amplified report, as their opinions receiued impression, some praysed his Feature, some his Countenance, some his vpright Comelinesse, some his well knit Ioynts, some his Demeanour, and some his Constancie in the affliction; nor wanted there others, which supposed him of better fortune, then his present shew portraited, so that for the time, Placandus house was neuer empty; many comming to see him, many to prayse him, many to iudge of their prayses, many not to be beholding to anothers report, many to giue notice, how well they had profited Montanus as Placandus seruant saluted by Coranus. in the Schoole of Ciuilitie, and many to performe Goodnesse, because Vertue delighteth in action: Amongst this number, Coranus though the last, which came, yet was not the least meanes of his comfort, because hauing him selfe experienced distresse, he tould, how counsell and reliefe might be seasonably confirmed, and heere, like the discreete Phisition, knowing the state of his Patients body, reduced him to some moderation; so that their humanity, and Placandus good vsage, made Montanus beleeue, he was ordayned

to this quietnesse: For with a kind of delight he put in practise willingnes, and exercise the ouermasterers of difficulties, which vnder propped his knowledge with these particulars, how to pasture the Cattle before the Sunnes pride might preuent theyr stomackes, how to guide them ere the Euening had determined theyr rest; when to water, and where to refresh them; when to driue them to the Fold, when to retyre from the Field, and in what sort to vse the instruments of commaunde his voyce and Pipe, all which were done with so good a grace, that the beholders woondred a

                      the action, and he mused how necessity had so soone acquainted the action: they loueing, his Maister liking; and hee satisfied to be thus loued and liked.
                  BY this time, Fame was not so nigardly, but Coranus not onely relateth the story of Montanus, but describeth him to his daughter Deltona. the women as wel as men (to whom in deed curiosity seemed more proper) entertained the newes, &amp; had not a customarie modesty restrained their desires, they would sooner haue satiated their longing then they did; yet because their Sommer Feast approched, in which many meetings, &amp; ancient ceremonies had their seuerall passages, their forward desire was a little suppressed, and the feastiuall approached to put them in remembrance, that Time had strengthned their encreases, and this Stranger expected the setting them selues foorth to best becomming:

In the meane while, Coranus returning home, told his Daughter Deltona (for the Man was wiuelesse, and a stranger amongst them) of Montanus ariuall with amplification of the circumstances belonging to his shipwracke, which because it agreed to their fortune, shee was willing to heare, and hee readie to dilate. Truely (quoth hee) I neuer saw a man of a better presence, his stature comely and tall, yet not exceeding mediocritie; his members so framed, as if our first Mother looking backe on the worke, had like a skilfull statuarie new polished, what shee escaped; his Shoulders Coranus describeth Montanus to Deltona. large, and Body vpright; of mighty Bone, and not ouermuch Flesh; the Necke in equality of length made to support a well proportioned Head; and an amiable, yet stately Countenance, which like some faire Planet in a frostie night, by speciall markes doth warrant him of Noble birth: For the Tresses spatiously plighted seeme to boast of extraordinarie curiousnesse, and the Tyara sumptuously fashioned, to propose vnto vs a very certainty of wealth: his Eyes according to the course they intende louely, compelled to distemperature fearefull, &amp; enclining to sadnesse, very Adamants of Compassion: to be plaine, hee may be what our greatest thoughts can comprehend; but as he is, we repute him Placandus seruant by name of Montanus.
                  
                  
                     Deltona could not but like her Fathers description, and allow of his opinion; yet was not satisfied

because shee had not seene him; and wished to see him, that she might be satisfied: wondring how her desire tooke vpon it such a libertie, and halfe ashamed, least her Father might perceiue her minde distempred, but hee poore man, had a world of conceites to thinke of: for though hee looked on her with a kind of demurenesse, yet was it to ouerlooke her, least shee might haue discouered his sighing and teares; which to preuent he cunningly led her foorth into a larger feeld of other conference; and so they remained with a reciprocall gladnesse not to be seene perplexed.
                  Now the Feast comming forward, Placandus much mooued with the desert of his new Seruant, and as it were enriched with the care he had ouer his charge, and the prosperitie following his care, thought to gratifie him with a thing of some worth, and therefore one Euening by way of relation, hee told the Storie how his Wife, his louing Wife, his louing loued Wife Iapeta, miscarying long since in child-birth, left him a fatherlesse, and a sorrowfull Widower, which for the time had such impression, that for feare to be so againe called to the account of passion, he vowed in Marpesias Caue, he would neuer marry; and although I haue found it a matter almost of impossibilitie to tie our frayltie to such strict rules: yet my honest Montanus, I haue waded through the difficultie, and I hope reserued my selfe to some good

the Haire vntyed without curiositie, but that the hanging downe seemed a curiousnesse, hung downe with sufficient comelinesse, their Loynes were loosely girt with a kind of Belt, which at pleasure made the neither part of their Mantell resemble a full blowne double Rose; their Countenances were amiable, youthfull, rather smiling then sad, and bending to another, respected none but them selues; the Head was decked with a Corenet of Flowers, as if they meant to tell vs, Vertue compelleth Honour as well as commendation, and the whole portrature so well graced, that a man could not but affoord a reuerence. In the midst of this roome was a square Table seruing to many purposes, as contracts of Mariages, the parties enterchangably embracing ouerthwart, then kissing, then with a setled countenaunce laying one hand vpon another, swearing an inuiolable League, Bargaines and exchangings dispatched, both buyer and seller promising no more, then they meant to performe, and performing no lesse then they presumed to promise; offerings of their encreases presented, which euer returned with aduantage, according to the willingnes of the partie and the honestie of the giuer: sacrifices for pacification fulfilled, as their consciences layed open transgression, or their desires meditated Religion, knowing the Gods were to be adored, and their neighbours to be beloued, The Anchress was extracted from

the blood of Prometheus, whom they superstitiously beleeued a great God, and once had his residence on Mount Caucasus, and so began a Familie amongst them: shee euer liued vnmaryed, and had sixe seruant Maides likewise to attend her her reputation was the greater, because she neuer fed the people with vntruths, nor exacted from them more, then their owne willingnes extended vnto: the inward Roome she kept shut, and yet stood open, while anyes businesse imported it, because the next commer might haue warning the place was supplyed: but why the name of Marpesia receiued estimation amongst them, you must bee thus aduised.
                  IN the mightie Kingdome of Scithia, at such The Story of Marpesia▪
                      time, as the first Amasons, women of Heroiecall courage, gloried to make themselues instruments of vertue; raigned as Queen the excellent Laciana: a woman of great Industrie, &amp; greater successe in her Industry: for much affecting the magnanimity of Tolmilanda, against the Tartarian Mulmashag, she fortunatly determined diuers famous exploits, and after gouerned the countreyes with such maiestie and wisedome, that other Kingdomes feared her displeasure, with louing her vertue; and her owne subiects had the practise of singular discipline, which so much the more grew beneficiall, by how much the imployment tended to their good: of her proceeded Deiophaeba, and from her

the faire Poligambis, vnder whom an enuious anger, that women should so raise the Trophees of Honor, excited the adioyning Kingdoms to conspire their destruction, and Fortune neuer constant but in vnconstancies, permitted a wicked Furie to massacre the wonderfulnesse of nature: wherein, though the large circumstance, and the strangenesse of the Action keepeth my tongue from her full discourse; yet this must I discouer, that the course of time disappointed their ambition, and dissolued this imparadised company: onely Marpesia sister to Poligambis, as it were alotted from the beginning to some deuinesse retyred hither, and erected another Regiment, but of diferent qualitie: For though shee grewe in fauour so Beautifull, and in Beauty so Celestiall, that the greatest Princes deuoted their endeuours to her acceptation: yet shee proclaimed against vanitie defiance, and Cupid stormed to bee so counterchecked: this made her abandon all Courtly fashions, least deceitfull temptation might at aduantage entrappe her weaknesse, and heere repose herselfe in a solitarie Groue, that a quiet dispensation from the company of men, might settle obedience to vndefiled thoughts. But some Writers haue iustified, how the desire of reuenge so exasperated her anger, that ere three yeeres had resetled the Company, and drawne backe againe her dispersed Forces, shee returned with a newe Alarum, and prosecuted her attempts with sufficient successe;

leauing the example of her glory to animate Lampedo to maintaine this second industrie, shee prospering induced Antiopa, from her proceeded Penthisilia the mother of the gallant Thalestris, and the last Marpesia: with whose renowne other Kings offended, Enuie neuer desisted, vutill they shrunke indeed vnder destruction. Howsoeuer, the reziance of the former Marpesia gaue name to this place, and occasioned these Ceremonies; so that after a ciuill consideration had acquainted the people with husbandry and tillage: in the felling and stocking vp the wood was this Caue found, for the wonderfulnesse religiously preserued, and the conueniencie in manner aforesaid regarded: and now beginneth our Festiuall.
                  AFter they had sacrificed at the Caue, the The Shepheards feast, wherein Mountanus and Deltona meet. Custome allowed Montanus with his Batchellers to deuide themselues amongst the Virgines, as Fancy led opinion the way to iudgement: but who had seen the louely Deltona comming forward, must needs haue remembred, that Diana with her Nymphes added something to Natutes allowance, when she was to entertaine so great a Lady; and Iupiter determined the Rape of Calisto: for whether the behauiour of this Stranger taught expectation the practise of other things, or whether time had ripened their estates, that they began to take benefit of their wealth; or whether their own conceits meant to make much

of the blessings of Nature, as not willing to continue in a barren rudenesse; or whether the acquaintance with ciuell Cities induced them to immitation, I dispute not, but the fortune of this day was such, that euery one in a manner sequestred from the common basenesse of Tartary, detayned the lookers on with the seuerall presentation of beautie and comelinesse.
                  Next to Deltona came Crolaca old Silenus 
                     The description of the shepherds daughters. Daughter, who manifested she was begotten in a time of discretion by attyring her Head after the plainest fashion, and because no deuise obscured any imperfection, she might the better haue satisfied a iudicious Censurer, had not the neere approach of a prying looke marked the equalitie of her forehead tending to a little flatnesse.
                  The second was Enseria very ill placed so neere the formost; her attire seemed rather fantasticall then costly, and added this to suspition, that shee determined some strange course of life, because her beautie was adulterate.
                  The third was Hiale, pleasant Parastoes daughter, who might well haue brought liking with admiration on her side; but that a little smiling somewhat more then cheerefulnesse (as if mirth determined not to goe out of a generation) cal'd her modestie in question, and ouer-wrought the ornament of her face, the mouth.
                  The foorth was Niphe, from whom some quarter of a yeere before, Deaths Harrold summoned

both Father and Mother; who amased the beholders with the appearance of liuely colours naturaly embelishing her cheekes, onely a dead eye accused her of fullennesse: yet it might be former remembrance admitted the vnkinde ghuest sorrow, and limited commendation from ouer-reaching too farre.
                  Now marched Ladra Daughter to Argias, (to whom for his excellencie in Musick, they had giuen a Pension) and was quickly seene: For hauing her Haire large, long, and of a singular amber; she ware it in a kinde of loosnesse; but so kindly, that it seemed an excellent carelesnesse: because shee was faire and vpright; yet kept pale Lippes, the full life of beautie aside.
                  Then presented her selfe Carista lusty Darpanos Daughter, who of purpose to shew varietie, or vnwilling to patrizare being a Maide merited a choyce commendation, had not a kind of sobrietie made her strangenesse reputed a littell pride, whereby a liuelinesse wanted to set foorth her worth to the best becomming.
                  The seuenth was Gralle Temellus onely Child, in whom the best cunning might be deceiued, because, though now a fauourable countenance seemed dimmed with ouermuch Blood, yet imputing it to a kind of blushing, or allowing time the effect of moderation, without doubt she was an amiable president of delight: so that Enuy added not this as an other fault, her speech was ouer loude.
                  
                     
The eight was Ranata, whose cost questionlesse exceeded her fortune; in regard, that beside a well proportioned Body, the face could boast of no great Beautie, and wanted many parts to make it fauourable.
                  Now approched Tarina ritch Pleios Daughter, who made demonstration of her Fathers Wealth, by her owne statelinesse, yet in so good an order, that it seemed a prerogatiue, and had not a seucere Censor exprobated Nature for not allowing so sweete an aspect a perfect clearenesse, to all others it either appeared no defect, or appearing durst not so be counted, considering her owne countenance better marked, dispelled the former conceit, and made a new impression applaud all deserued worthinesse.
                  Next her came Carix blacke Alcastoes Daughter, whose Haire enclining to a more then brownnesse, added that bie name: yet was she full of fauour, which seemed attractiue as ioyned to a sober demeanor; so thou couldest not choose, but repine at Nature for vniting two contraries togeather, because the choysest louer was astonished, when that nakednesse (which modesty allowed to be seene) surpassed the rest for dellicacie and coloure.
                  The 11. was called the strange Duplana, who hauing no good part exactly lookt vpon, possessed yet euery part without exception; because her sweete cariage and dellicate behauiour strocke an

amazement, ere you could examine the particulars.
                  The last of especiall note, was Sabetha, and in outward shew the least; but such a least, as shined like a sparcke of Pleasure: for the Eyes were able to enflame, the Countenance to enamoure, and her selfe so well fashioned to rauish: so that if a man would haue wished to be the beholder of a dellicate creature, the outward shew warranted, and the inward persection confirmed her the same.
                  
                     But to returne to Deltona, like a braue pointed Diamonde triumphing ouer a border of prety ones, not altogether so well foiled, shee warranted her Liuery to be sued out of the Court of Perfection, and with all vnited a magnificent portlinesse; that Montanus imagined strange things, and suspected himselfe surprized with the imagination, as though he durst haue sworne, shee deserued farre better then a simple Cottage: yet allowing as a Stranger the iudgement of so many, that tooke her for Coranus daughter, he quieted his thoughts, because the businesse in hand disappointed Meditation, had not the businesse disquieted him with Meditation. For hee was to salute, entertaine, welcome them, and to place them at the Table, which according to their olde Customes (least error might breed repining in wronging one another) hee orderly performed: but taking Deltona by the hand, as if Loue and Fortune had vsed

some conference about it, he made her his owne obiect.
                  By this time it was a world to see, how a little strangenesse can alter the whole companie: For the vpper Table consisting of the better, and elder sort weeried Placandus with many questions, and in a manner seemed emulous against the other for hauing Montanus amongst them: They againe reioyced in his presence, and were soone induced to allow him some preeminence, and truely howsoeuer he liked their fashions, or fashioned himselfe to their liking, or was now setled in the aduantage of his owne amiable and portly countenaunce, hee seemed, as if a good Husbande had preserued a stately Cedar in a conuenient Groue of smaller Trees, whereby hee might boast of one surpassing all the rest: but doe not suppose hee was so generally regarded of them, as particularly noted by Deltona, who could not so moderate her neerenesse, but shee must eye him at the full, and when it seemed a pleasing thing to behold, she tooke the occasion of beholding him to be pleased: then she attempted to refraine, little knowing the restraint, made her next looking passionate: yet excused by the curtesie to Strangers, she againe emboldned her selfe to looke, and to speake, both performed with such Loue-infusing sweetnesse, that Montanus protested maiestie was betrayed to the meanest deiection. For how could so great beautie seeme kinde, but hee

must be friendly? How could shee demaund, but he must answere? How could she view him, but he must review her? How could shee craue, but he must allow it? How could shee execute any thing, but he must be pleased? Insomuch that this first acquaintance warranted delight in the highest manner, and soothed their desires to wish the continuance; yet those wishes were not ready toadmit any stedfastnesse, because Montanus was to forward the Dances, which for the first day concluded the pastimes, wherein no sooner setled he himselfe to the measure with Deltona, but as if a soft Esterly winde had with a sudden strength sturred the thicke leaued trees, a certaine wispering of the company from mutuall eying them proceeded to liking; from liking to affecting; from affecting to praysing; from praysing to wishing them some good; and debating wherein, confirmed it by marriage: the rather because they had demeaned themselues so well before, and seemed now sutable in a Liuerie of preeminence: but other Coples presented occasion of new speach: yet Montanus stil in sight was stil remembred, as busied in ordring the next commers out to the Dances.
                  HEere then was deciphered sober Eugenio, who by the outward countance assured, his The discription of the shepheards. care was greater to encrease his wealth, then his pleasure.
                  Louely Miletus a man still practising of good as one, which knew no bad.
                  
                     
Rich Polio, whose abilitie outcountenanced imperfections, which without doubt would else in pouertie not without scandall haue appeared, besides hee published this errour, that counting Vertue but the passage of breath, hee esteemed Money before a Friend.
                  Rude Sciscus, who in an ill accomplished pride, shewed rather a willingnesse to the vice, then was fashioned to any Grace or good Manner.
                  Vnfortunate Pleistos, whose Fancie was euer haunted with a counter-changeable crossenesse, as a man playing with his Shadow running from that, which followed him, and prosecuting, what seemed to fly from him.
                  Quiet Dromos, who yet was abused for his opinion of consience, and a slacknesse to reueng euery disgrace, gaue suspition of cowardice.
                  Peuish Derson, who carlesse either of Order, or good Manner belonging to education, manifested a very scorne of behauiour, and harsh extremitie of humours.
                  Modest Ergastus, as one speaking little, but meditating the more, loth to giue occasion of offence, and vnwilling to remaine sullen.
                  Froward Romero, who indeed hauing a naturall gift of vtterance was not tongne-tyed, as supposing his speech to be still pleasing.
                  Stubborne Bustosa who had no good qualitie, but plainenesse.
                  Pleasant Tedanus, who graced with many qualities

was as gracious to seuerall Companies.
                  Sturdie Philastro, who thought well of himselfe, because he was able to match his hardest il willer.
                  Besides that did not dance, Enuious Franio, who was not onely ill in himselfe, but compassed to make all others like himselfe.
                  THVS prooued their Actions to bee the seruants of time, and with making their Procession The continuance of the Feast, with the Exercises of the shepheards. once againe about the Pastures, that dayes iollitie was ended, so they thought it conuenient to depart, which without further curiositie they would haue done, had not Montanus by taking leaue of Deltona, giuen notice to the rest, that some Ceremonie of good obseruation, addeth a grace to each Action. But depart they must, and depart they did, which being no longer then the next Morning: The next Morning they thought it ouer long, vntill the swiftnesse of their 
                        •…
                     ooteman-shippe gaue the Reward to the best deseruer.
                  BVt when Montanus saw Deltona holde the Garland, at the vpper end of the Lists, which The secodn meeting of Montanus and Deltonae he quickly did, because the place and her selfe were of specialtie; or els Loue (if hee durst haue so perswaded himselfe) is quicke sighted, he stood amazed, almost neglecting what hee had in hand: yet lest the company might ouer-looke his distemperature; or that his owne disposition still desired, what

was excellent; or ielious, that any other should watch Deltona with the like regard; or emulous to hazzard his credit by being ouer-mastered, hee gallantly set forward; and was indeede so forward, that while the rest repined at Fortune to suffer a Stranger to glory in their disgrace, he had time to tell her, that her matchlesse beauty was attractiue, and had added wings to his willingnesse: with that shee gaue him the Garland to weare, and forgaue him a kisse which hee stole: Now? Whether kisses produce strange Effects? Or some naturall secret was infused with the new breath? he remained distracted, and seemed more pleased with the theft, then the sonne of Maia, 
                     when he had beguiled the euer waking eyes of Argus:
                      but the Company comming forward deuided his desire, and ouer-wrought his countenance by bestowing liberall prayses on his desert.
                  Thus did a second meeting encrease more vertue, and liking. For many qualities in one man, helpe forward to excellencie; and diuers interviewes in well-willing parties, conclude affection: which (to bee plaine) prooued heere in short time a strange deuise of Fortune, but wee are not yet ready for such contentment, because the third dayes Exercise, which was Wrastling (Placandus, Silenus, and Argias, Iudges) presented it selfe with an excellent temprature. Imagine yet Montanus was not so hasty, but he looked vp to the Mount. to see Deltona, who soone apprehended the motion,

and looked too; by which he supposed shee bade him to remember himselfe, as if the secret of his desaster had been discouered: In this feruencie he stepped foorth vncalled, neuer seeming angry till now; not to be feared, till hee was angry, and then were all commers ouer-throwne: what he yet did, proceeded rather from a necessary vertue, then a vaine ostentation, vnlesse it were in the contention with Franio, whom for ill lookes and base manner of Play, valour scorned, so that adding a little violence to disdaine, the fall brake his arme; no man so sorry for his hurt, as glad of Montanus estimation which by a generall Plaudite, and theyeelding vp the Prizes, gaue him testimonie of regard.

But heere ended their Pastimes, which according

Else you must thinke; heere were such, as did loue, could hurt, might mallice, durst controll, and knew to reuenge; all which were afterward put in execution, when folly and impierie entred the breach against goodnesse. But the time importuned their care ouer their estates, which consisting in the prosperity of their cattle compelled a generall retyring to their Heards &amp; Flocks.
                  NOw; what was this retyring, but a very Montanus in loue with Deltona. tyring of Montanus, in whose conceit Fancy already had made Impression? For though the outward shew discouered no distemperature, yet the wit much out of frame, striued to restraine it self from any base scope: and whether other company put him in minde of the absence of Deltona? Or that the nature of absence bred a greater desire to possesse the thing vnobtained, he suddenly began to be angry with himselfe for suffering her departure, and encreased his anger with despaire of her returne; but giuing that stoppe a dash with an heroicall presumption, that

nothing was impossible, it somewhat setled him in the hope of a new meeting: at last he began a strict examination, why his minde should so run on Deltona; his sleepes in broken dreames of Deltona; his dreames, that hee meeteth Deltona? his waking fancie recounting the worth of Deltona; stedfastly supposing a shepheards daughter could not be Deltona? But the more hee meditated, the sooner he receiued a foile, for lacke of resolution, so that by this time the want of the thing longed for was not so great, as the meanes to obtaine it daungerous: his feare, mistrusting the practises hee meant to set on worke, and his desire importuning some satisfaction: this willed him to repayre to solitarinesse, where hee quickly ranne ouer the rugged Fieldes of disquiet; sometime condemning fondnesse and folly for consorting together, then exclaming on his owne weakenesse, for yeelding to such degenerate companions: other-while hee met with consideration, that man was subiect to many inconueniences; anon he encountered with patience, a strange vertue to pull on heauier burdens; sometime hee vp brayded his peuishnesse for his submission, after the Battle with Leonidas; and by &amp; by, he protested to abiure both the place and the companie: But this seeming a counterfeit stoutnesse (as if hee had offended by such imagination) set him foorth to the recourse of his Friendes; but alas, their Welcome prooued like a trayterous Banquet,

wherein mischiefe counterfeiteth to betray a man, and sounded in his eares, they were the enemies of Reposednesse; whereupon hee practised againe to be alone, had not so many by wayes of Fancie confounded him, that hee durst not abide the fearefulnesse of being alone. Thus euery thing framed the vnframing of his health, and brought him at last to the vnkind acquaintance of a Feuer, whereby he wanted orderly rest, and naturall diet, the soule bearing the body company in tollerating many changeable inflictings, as it had yeelded to a sence-weakning violence; sometime leaning the head against a firmenesse, as if he meant to settle his Braine: otherwile the Armes crossed with strength, resembled two strong Barres, which bound in the Heart from flying out of her inclosure: Sometimes his Feete stood him in stead to pace out his griefe: anone a Palle

                      seemed proude of the ease it affoorded: presently the Ground was his resting place, and at last by his vnrest, hee could abide in no place; which when the good old Placandus had discouered, the care and opinion, which he conceiued of his new adopted Sonne, made him pitty his distresse, and put in execution his pitty.
                  
                     My Sonne (quoth hee) doubt not to vnlocke the treasure of thy thoughts to mee: For as I haue respected thy desert, and loued thee with the same respect; so hath my loue ouerwatched thy griefe, and that loue made me partaker of the sorrow:

Bee therefore perfect in thy former Wisedome, and thinke there is a remedie to each desaster; by my Zeale, and thy owne Vertue I therefore coniure thee, let mee know the occasion, whereby thou hast admitted this discontentment, and welcommed so vnkind guestes as Griefe, and Disquiet. Looke how a man hearing the sound of some sweete harmonie, and vnwilling to deceiue his sence of the pleasure, biddeth a silence; so stood our passionate Montanus, while Placandus had thus broken the enclosure of his sullennesse: and finding Silence a tyrant maintaining this faction of distemperature against him, he thus replied. O Father, this childishnesse, folly, and negligence, is worthy reprehension! yet pardon my vnwillingnesse either to be childish, foolish, or negligent? And this I doe protest, vnlesse some secret influence had ouer-wrought my spirits, no peeuish Humour could haue thus mastred mee. For to be plaine; I like Deltona, I loue Deltona; yea and liue in the loue and liking of Deltona: But suppose not? this breuitie marcheth with the same slightnesse: For a world of secrets depend on my speaches, yet my tongue hath now mittigated the burdensome paine of my heart, which otherwise like a well stopped Ouen, had increased the burning heate fo

                  When Placandus heard the name of Deltona pronounced, you might haue compared him to a man meeting an Adder in an vnbeaten path,

and starteth for feare, as if indeed the worme had mischieued him, so gaue hee a sudden motion prognosticating further mishap: Oh (saith hee) what doth Montanus attempt? I thinke she hath vowed her selfe to scorne, and proclaimed defiance against Fancie: Else would she neuer haue checked Fortune in her full flight of happinesse toward her? For Rugeo Duke of Fortuna tempted her constancie, and attempted to perswade a more glorious alteration: but she to all our amazements denied the honour, and ouer-prised this quietnes beyond Courtly vanitie: yet (my Sonne) because Loue and deuine appointment hath some secret in store, I wish thee not despaire; but vse my credit, and thine owne desert to hold the beame, wherein Loue weigheth the fancies of women: onely as a Caueat, beware of Franio; for besides the generall ill conditions wherewith he is infected; I heare he whispereth, yea murmureth against thee, which proceeding from malice hath this propertie, neuer to desist, till with aduantage it prooue inficious. Farre bee it from my obedience answered Montanus, not to make vse of your aduice and encouragement, I will therefore by the great eye of heauen, goe to morrow to Coranus howse, a day wherin as the world agreed to yeeld me life, so may Cupid assent to afford mee ioy to my life; but while he prepareth for his iourney, let vs see how Deltona is willing to admit him.
                  
                     
AFter the Feastiuals had end, Coranus with his Deltona in loue with Montanus, and how they came togeather. Daughter returned home, who poore soule very quickly began another manner of Banquet: For somewhat too curious in the musing at her owne weaknesse, to be ouerswayed with conceit, shee liued extreame pensiue; now whether continuall pensiuenesse debarring life openeth vnto griefe, griefe vnto distemperature, and distemperature vnto sicknesse, I know not; but shee seemed suddainely surprised; and neither waked with quietnesse, nor slept in soundnesse, shee would looke sad, figh often, practise extrauagant actions, and yet say little; which questionlesse kept the more in store against shee discouered her passion: But her Father was mightily perplexed, because his care extended to the highest degree of regard; and her sorrow continued with the sorest manner of trouble: therefore finding the body distempered from the minde, hee setled to ouerwatch her, if at any time he might discouer the cause. For though Phisicke can cure diseased bodies, when the Infirmitie is knowne, yet hath it small power ouer troubled Passions arysing from hidden Distemperature: At last (some excuse of businesse emboldning her to presume on his absence) his patience ouer matched ignoraunce, and one morning acquainted this abruptnesse.
                  Surely (quoth shee) I cannot beleeue my selfe the seruant of Vertue, when I finde the best part of

Truely (sayd he) welcome, and it the word welcome might last so long, as my desire to bid you welcome, I should doe nothing but repeate welcome. In this extrauagant manner, as if Montanus presence had strucke both a reuerence and delight, or his daughters griefe entreated redresse, hee vsherd him through two roomes into a lowe chamber, and bad him tary till he prepared his entertainement. But when Montanus beheld Deltona

                      hee approached vnto her: To whom when he came, and that a little disdaine had scorned to be entrapped, whereby a womanly remembrance hastned to lap her cloaths togeather, which for her ease she had vnlaced: the strangenesse of the accident ouercame her former desire, and a pretty shame to be watched, made her affrayde of what she wished; and her feare onely put in practise a confused flight, which Montanus durst not yeeld vnto, and therefore with a reuerent speedinesse caught hold of her arme, almost bare by hasty massacring the artificiall garment, whereby his eyes setled now their quicknesse, and new thoughts immagined a very fire to burne his presuming hand: As for what was treasured vnseen, he imputed that to the cunning of the Ieweler who first laying abroad to the contentment of the

beholders his smaller prised Riches, doth only declare, hee hath a Iem of that inestimable vallew, as may well suffice to be a present for the greatest Monarch: with the like disposition was Montanus transported, and therefore loth to loose the benefit of what his hope assured was pretious, hee entreated her aboad; and perceiuing her somewhat more tractable, thus disputed the matter.
                  
                     Most worthy of the greatest worth; neither are teares the Antidotes of griefe, nor griefe a preuention of trouble: yet do we complaine to see Mortality the tennisball of Fortune, now stroke low, then mounted high; anone beaten backe againe, and at last banded quite away, little remembring that Vertue remaineth immaculate, and bringeth Patience to ouermaster Aduersitie, which in very meane spirits vpholdeth weaknesse and fraylty, by considering diuine prouidence hath ordained, what neither industry can preuent, nor mans cunning auoyde: but in greater courages, when soeuer crosses chaunce, there must be a representing of the Sunne, which at the lowest seemeth biggest; and indeed affliction retyreth, when shee is with constancie tollerated: Deny not therefore Vertue her due in subiecting it to so bace an enemie as Despaire; nor Beautie preeminence in thus disordering thy most faire amongst the fairest fairenesse: But leaue this sadnesse, &amp; by the immortall powers I sweare (which with an Emphasis he pronounced) no discontentment shall affright thee:

for my selfe wil vndertake the office of a neighbor to comfort, of a friend to assist, or of: which hee would faine in a more kinder terme haue vttered, but not knowing what it was, hee left her to imagine, what it might be.
                  
                  Heere a mannerly stoppe, and a prety fashion of amazement caused his strength compassing her tender wrist to suffer some changes, and withall a sad kinde of looke waranted his wordes to proceed from true desire: but when shee marked the orderlinesse of his behauiour, and that a different grace warranted a greater desert, then his present fortune: a blessed hope sent to her countenance the Messenger of delight, and erected vp a well proportioned body to her better becomming: yet had a powerfull reason in the time of this parlie so tempered her ioy, that shee meant not ouer sodenly to consent to her owne minde, nor yeelde him too hasty libertie of presumption; like a discreet Master, who though his seruant bee painefull wil not ouer-familiarly thanke, but with good order embolden him to goe forward in his dutie: therefore as if shee could haue entertained an angry mislike, she thus replyed.
                  
                  Why, who is Montanus? that thus enueigheth against Fortune, as if honour had read a Lesson of magnanimitie vnto him? or from whence proceedeth this audacity to poison my vertues spring with the dregs of peeuish Loue? Or what maleuolent Planet was ouer this day predominant,

that I must be thus intercepted? Beleeue me, I am afraid I haue played the truant in the Schoole of Modestie, and forgetting my rules by ouer courtesie allowed this stranger some hardinesse: Assure thee therfore, that in the very mislike of this boldnesse, all other good parts are eclipsed in thee, and howsoeuer I could be perswaded to suppose any goodnesse in mariage, Placandus sonne must take another course: for my wits were neuer so enchanted to repulse the offer of a mighty Duke, and submit to a shepherds flattery: but to be plaine, I haue deuoted my selfe to another Saint, and offred my incense on the pure altar of Continency.
                  
                  When hee had heard her out, as if a sudden feare fatally prognosticated some following mischiefe, or sullen anger kept the motion of the tongue from true liuelinesse? hee stood amazed, scarse able to yeeld a reason why he was amazed: like a man meditating in secret stilnesse, who looketh, yet perceiueth not on what, by reason the minde transporteth the vse of sence to other purpose: But knowing custome taught all women the deniall of what they wished, as though hee would haue chid her for such generall peuishnesse he once againe replyed. By the giuer of my life, this peremptorinesse shall not accord with successe, nor will I hazard the losse of what I esteeme so precious: Remember therefore the wrong thou shalt doe to nature in obscuring her blessings from the delight of men; remember the displeasure to the

world, in depriuing it of the fruites of Mariage: Remember the iniurie to mee, who can ballance thee beyond expectation, and boast his regarde meriteth a better recompence, then despight. With this the countenance began to readmit a pristinate excellencie, and Deltona supposed shee saw a new Montanus; which questionlesse much imboldned her, and bade hope entertaine an other Ioy: Now when Ioy came to play her part, no deuice serued to counterfeite Disdaine: onely Wisedome limitted her Passion within sure bounds, and she somewhat relenting, thus answered, Wel; if the meditation of this busines perswad mee to a sweete mischiefe, I will not altogeather reiect your remembrance; and if my Genius hauing hitherto protected my Fayth and Chastity, thinke it now time to supplant it with a necessary ill, I am content to lay open the records of your merit and loyaltie: Yet presume not in this as an answer, nor allow Hope any libertie to suppose, that I shall euer be perswaded to loue. But hee hearing her name Loue; with a portly demeanour stepped forward, and caused a mannerly neernesse to make impression on her lippes, saying withall. My dearest life; by thy Beautie I sweare, it shall returne from whence it came, and thus will I keepe in this loue-breathing sweetnesse, that it may diue backe againe to the heart, and worke there conuenient motiones of delight: now whether the sudden audacitie countermaunded preuention;

But words said she, be like the passage of a shippe, leauing no shew behinde of her course, and promises resemble fading shadowes. Then try performance (replied Montanus) vertue appeareth in her liueliest colours in action. Nay, yet obiected Deltona, better liue with want os something may be wished for then in certaintie of euery thing breedeth trouble. Why (quoth Montanus) is there such trouble in Marriage? I assure you not (said Coranus) for if the parties loue vpon a sure ground, they resemble a building strongly founded, and one part depending on another equally deuideth the comfort: againe, when inconueniencies arise, least the burden proue too grieuous, a yoke-fellow helpeth, &amp; between them it is made lightsome, besides the tirannie of want is surprised with content, and mutuall agreement ouer commeth necessitie. But letting this passe (beleeue me) Montanus we are

very glad of your companie, and since your aduenture, me thinkes there appeareth (I know not) what alteration. But I know (said Deltona) to look smooth, to dispute cunningly, to seeme ceremonious, to bring presents, to vse protestations, and commit errors: and if all this tende to good purpose, I see no cause of mislike, nor I of liking answered Deltona, but to despise all these and make account of simple trueth. Well, quoth Coranus, let vs set our teeth on worke, as we haue done our tongues, and for conclusion Deltona and I will visite Placandus to morrow.
                  Thus passed away the time, and this meeting with the time, yet could not Montanus (after thankes for his entertainement) but take a kinde leaue of Deltona, leauing her indeed musing at the departing with these tearmes: My life and Loue once for all liue to be happy, and suppose, there is more in Montanus loue then thou canst imagine; so farewell, and let them feare ill, that wish not Deltona to farewell. But least he should ouerprise this iollitie, misfortune presented him to an ominous chance, the meeting with Franio: the same Franio, whose willingnesse to mischiefe exceeded Montanus meeteth with Franio, comming from Corauus. his power, yet had his power compassed some hatefull stratagems: The same Franio, whose arme was broken in wrestling with Montanus, and whose heart receiued infection from the sirruppe of malice: The same Franio who therefore pryed into Montanus actions, not with a desire of imitation,

nor with a slender wickednesse, only to find fault at imperfection, but with an implacable hatred to supplant him, as the least occasion hapned: euery way playing the Monster of Nature; neither daring to execute his owne reuenge, nor willing that he should perceiue him reuengefull: For still his countenance was as full of flatterie, as the heart of Deceit: This appeared in his ceremonious saluting of Montanus, which continued with tearmes of good will, and by way of insinuation gaue him notice his Iorny was discouered; insomuch that he knowing excuses would increase suspition, in good fashion told him, how Placandus had intreated Coranus and his Daughter to visit him to morrow. That is very strange (quoth Franio;) for euer since the Duke threatned to steale her away, wee neuer saw her but at the Feast. Heere might Montanus haue easily stepped into a litle curiosity, as not yet acquainted with any certainty of this story, but loth to be beholding to such a man for a discourse, he somewhat cunningly shifted him off, &amp; by excuse of businesse, as contraries, departed the one full of diuolish mischief the other of honest desires.
                  When Montanus came home, he told his Father the substance and circumstance of his Iorney, the sicknesse of Deltona, the entertainement of Coranus,

To be plaine (answered he) it is full twelue yeares since her Father and she were cast on shore by shipwracke; where euer since they haue continued with such applause &amp; regard, that of him we haue esteemed as a man industrious and peaceable; and of her, as a very sparke of delight.

that he had been an obstacle to his desires. Therefore with a kinde of indifferencie, like a skilfull Rider, that neither checketh too hard for feare of disordering the mouth; nor yet giueth that liberty to countenance any head-strong defect: hee thus replyed. Well Deltona, hitherto all is well; and since you are thus amended, thinke the Gods keepe their mercy in store, and powers inscrutible: Let not vs then subuert the frame of their workmanship by beeing wilfull or preiudicate, but rather consent to direction and aduice, which resemble the props of a ruinous Building: Bee therefore affable; yet vse it as a vertue, not imperfection. Loue with relation to deseruing worth: yet consent not too soone, least thy good meaning be misinterpreted. Consent at leasure; yet keepe chastity secured, so shalt thou be sure of more desire, and more reuerence: For though men say, they can be contented with a vertuous familiarity▪ yet is the conquest of that, the India of their treasure. With all bee not an enemie to Nature, in suffering the fruit to perish without vse; but let a timely Haruest reape vp the Come, least it shed as

                      no limitation, and offection is only subiect to the outward demeanour, as you see in the world so many matches concluded

in despight of reason. True said Coranus, where Vertue preuaileth not against Idlenesse, or good councell helpeth to see the deformitie of Folly, which is as easily suppressed with carefull endeauours, as maintained with retchlesse liberty. But thinke you (answered the halfe fearefull Deltona) that inferiour meanes can reuerse appointment? Questionlesse (replied Coranus) Destinie is ineuitable, and Fate an Irreuocable decree, yet is it conuenient to tell wilfull youth the contrary, that restraining their frowardnesse, they may suppose it a treason against wisedome, not to be directed by the Clue of aduise. Well (concluded Deltona) let the Gods bee Controllers of mischiefe, and men the possessors of reason. Thus posted that night to the Kindome of darkenesse, and the next morning like a bitter root throwne into a dish of sweet sirrupe approched, wherein Fortune threatned to be in this manner maleuolent.
                  LIttle knew Montanus of Franio

Sonne: then from the naturall Country-men so carry away the Prize with the good opinion of the beholders, next amongst all

others to tryumph in his disgrace and hurt: Lastly (as it were to despight him) to seeme acceptable to Deltona; so that with the spider onely looking the venum; hee soothed Enuie to maligne him: Now when Enuie saw her selfe Mistris of conceit, shee desisted not, vntill her associat rage were entertained. Rage againe interdicting reason yoelded to the violence of Hate▪ and Hate tyrant-like, boyling with the heate of crueltie, meditated nothing but reuenge: with these humours gathered Franio together some speciall coadiutors, though Wicked idle men described: not altogether so wicked as himselfe; yet easily seduced, as men vntractable to good, and therefore vnesteemed for their apparant bad, as men liuing in a liberall opinion of conscience, therefore neuer sollicited but for diuelish attempts, as

                  When he had deliuered his minde, they onely considering the present complaint, and falsely misconstring the renowne of the businesse, soone consented to what he perswaded (for indeed heere were none to perswade otherwise then he would consent vnto) and so they promised with foure on horsebacke, and fiue well appoynted, to be in readinesse; which though it seemed very slender against an enterprise of difficulty; yet had they reason to presume sufficient against a silly Mayden, and old Man. But returning to Montanus; eie the next morning had fully drawne the Curtaines of light, his remembrance brought him to a kind of feare, that he had ouerpassed good manners in not attending her, on whom his very soule and thoughts attended: therefore he prepared himselfe, not forgetting some addition of comelinesse, as if indeed loue had taught him the way to handsomnesse; and so he saluted Coranus, and againe

and againe the much attractiue Deltona, whom Hope had long since perswaded to thinke on nothing, but new delight. Thus passed curtesie counterchangeably betweene them; and so comming along, they entred the freedome of other conference, vntill the freedome and conference presented them to the bondage of Franios treason; who had no sooner, a sight of them, but sodenly step

But when Montanus saw her fall, it was not a feare, it was a very dispaire of her life hastned his race, and by ouer-great desire to saue her, hee might haue lost himselfe; but that Deltona cryed, I am well, if you take heed. This directed his other sence to performe the best part of his function, which saw Franio hastning against him with his Sword drawne. Now was Vallour almost betrayde for want of Resolution, because on the one side Death appeared in a desperate encounter; on the other, Shame in a da

but in minde of redresse, he aduaunced the colours of a magnanimous heart, and so as a man experienced in the many changes of execution, he wrapped the Mantle about his arme, and told the beholders they should see a strange sight, a man on foote and vnarmed encounter with another o

                     a poysoning bacenesse, thought to pash out his braines, had not feare to die, taught him to counterfeit death to liue: so that Montanus seeing him sprawle, as killed with the bruse, left him to wander to the borders of Desperation, and pressed to another, in the same rage, making him loose his head for not keeping his Sword.
                  But who had seene Montanus on horsebacke with a Sword drawne in his hand, might questionlesse haue been deceiued▪ for though the Horse wanted either comelinesse or qualitie to grace a man
                        •…
                     et was there in him both horsemanship and statelinesse to beautifie the Beast, whereby the Vilanies were quickly dispersed; and Mischiefe complained, her seruants had not well learned instruction: onely Coranus heartned with the likelihood of successe, &amp; striking Bustofa Franios chiefe coadiutor, had submitted to his youth &amp; strength:

but that Montanus vndertooke the quarrell, and with a violent reuerse, deuided the Sword arme from the body; which onely gaue him this notice, Hee might better run away then fight, as hauing two Legges, and but one Arme.
                  In the meane while Deltona freed her selfe of the dead body, and seeing Franio panting, another slaine, a third wounded, a fourth armelesse, Montanus on horsebacke, &amp; Coranus well, she was well too. Thus is the danger ouerpassed, and the hurliburly appeased; onely Franio miraculously recouering was glad to liue, glad to submit, that hee might liue; and in the submission excusing himselfe by the power of loue, which (though as a riual had been cause enough of his confusion) yet because there wanted all those motiues of Ielowsie, hee being so vnworthy a person, Montanus framed a patience, and left him to the dishonour of the action, intreating Deltona to take in worth this poore peece of seruice, and set forwarde with a more emboldning comfort. Nay (quoth shee) feare and discontentment are now to act their partes; My Father therefore and I will surely home, and attende the welcome of better successe; In the meane space, haste you to Placandus, 
                     and let the trueth of the matter blason your credite, and your credite with the circumstances exasperate the wickednesse, that the rest remaine without grudging, and you without blame. This he wi

                     ed him to do, and this he did, because

shee willed: but Fame of her owne disposition had quickly diuulged the accident, and one of the parties enlarged it with many circumstances shewing some property of goodnesse, as if Remorce had bade him first confesse, then be sorrowfull; and last, endeuour satisfaction: The trueth of whose report, quickly strook both a feare and hate: For who could not but feare the losse of that beautie, the hazard of such persons, the slaughter which did, and might haue ensued? Who could not, but hate the malice put in practice, the manner of the trechery, and the parties, that so shewed them selues the slaues of villany.
                  But when Placandus stomaked the disgrace, and that a litle meditation had considered on the shame, if such a president might passe with our, controlment or correction. Montanus had much adoe to disswade him from present complaint to the Duke, intimating that it could not choose but he must be made acquainted with the matter by a generall murmuring; now if it pleased him to apprehend it as an exorbitant action, without doubt in his owne honour hee would take the cause in hand: but if any other humour would suffer his conniuencie thereat, then the better course were to supresse it, considering iustice in supernaturall pitty had awarded so good a verdict on their side. This modest behauiour of Montanus, produced more loue, and more regard; more loue for those Vertues abounding in him; more regard, for that

Wisedome, which knew to put them to gracing vses. All this seemed yet insufficient to his satisfaction, without bringing his Shippe into the safe and desired harbour; wherefore he thought it high time to vnuaile the Maske of his metamorphosis, rather then thus to hazard his soules life, or tye his owne greatnesse to this course any longer; besides, delay was a kind of torment to his passion; and the feare of being ouer-watched with malicious eyes, bade him dispatch: to which resolution, hee fastned his anchor-hold, and Fortune once againe thus dallied with him.
                  
                     DEltona safe at home, thought this safety an exceeding disquiet; yea a very intermixture Deltona is resolued to know what Montanus is, and what shal be the issue of their loue; &amp; so goeth to Marpesius Cane, where she entertaineth Montanus. of torment, considering shee saw so many tokens of greatnesse in Montanus, and founde her heart violently caried in the streame of affection towards him, and yet was debarred the happinesse, which her hope flattered to inioy: like a man brought to the delight of a dellicate Orchard, and by standing on a Bancke ouerlooketh the same with a longing desire of entrance, according to the Gardners promise, and yet is delayed with excuses: Whereupon shee assured her Father, her felt was vp, and shee would referre it to no other tryall. Hee poore man still doubtfull, durst not answer to the purpose, but thought by cunning rather to mittigate the violence,

then with reason to resell the argument which perceiued by Deltona (as if indeed shee could haue welcommed an vnmannerly guest wilfulnesse) shee bade him not trifell, but conclude with effect. Why then (quoth hee) wee will goe to Marpesias Caue, as well to be thankfull for the escape of our late perill, as to present our Offertorie, which we haue not yet done: there shall the Anchresse warrant your successe, or controll to a new course. Glad was she of this: glad was hee of her gladnesse: the one allowing any thing, might adde life to her desires: the other, disalowing euery thing, might disparage her worth: yet the next day he brought her along, not desisting from a milde passage of speach tending to instructions, by the way.
                  TO this place (O happy Fortune, that conducted Montanus commeth to Marpesias Caue, and findeth Deltona. him to this place) did Montanus single her out: for as the working of his spirits draue him to pace out his fancie in the fields, hee saw Coranus and Deltona passe the Groue toward the Caue; and knowing the limitation of his aboade would be quickly measured: hee very couertly entred the Sanctuarie, as soone as Coranus had yeelded her the freedome of being alone, and in a kind of distemperature betwixt feare and gladnesse hasted into the roome of Statuas, where Deltona was off ciously disposing her affaires. But when shee saw her Deuotion intercepted, and Montanus so

strangely audacious, shee neither knew what to thinke, or to say: for her thoughts were at variance betweene Desire and mistrust, and her speach was stopped with amazement; so that shee almost fainted for feare, had not feare in an other nature, least shee might be surprised added life to her fainting. On the other side, when Montanus saw the errour of his rashnesse, the first liuelinesse was quite rebated; and the conceit at her distemperature, made him checke his folly for being no better aduised; at last finding ouer-shamefastnesse to be more childish then man-like, and that a retreat would rather shew a demissnesse, then audacitie a fault, he thus framed his treatise of pacification.
                  
                     My most deare, and dearer then my dearest life; Fortune euer maleuolent vnto mee, hath now taken pitty vpon mee, and weary of her tyranny, brought mee to this place of delight: By Loues chiefe happinesse, I therefore pray thee, make my Hopes legitimate, and my worthily bestowed Affection, the fortunate child of contentment; least you ouerpasse the glory of a strange conquest, which may adde to thy desert, what the greatest thoughts can imagine, and I repent too late for submitting Princely maiestie to the censure of a Shepheards Daughter. Till this, her amazednesse at the accident rather tollerated, then admitted, what was done: but hearing him name a tytle of that consequence, a new ioy quickly reuiued her spirits: like a friend in ambush reuiewing a priuate

Combat, and seeing some dangerous inequalitie rusheth out either to deuide the contention, or assist the weaker side; this made her thankfull to the Nimphs, as if her Orizons had wrought the propitiation, and accepting it for answer from the Oracle, (as if she had knowne before he had taken this counterfeite vpon him) shee replyed.
                  Little needed Montanus, (for in that title my liking consented to Montanus) to haue boasted of Genealogies, or names of Dignitie: so that (to be plaine,) I was euer carryed with the streame of Fancie; yet durst I not betray my forwardnesse to the violence of Passion, vntill I was assured of her respect to vertue, (to whom, seeing my vowes haue specially combined mee) be thou vertuous, and be Montanus, or Prince, or what thou wilt; and I shall then loue thee for vertues sake. What call you Vertue, answered he, by Marpesias Altar? By the sacred Nimphs, by these starlike Eyes, (which I will charme with my kisses) I meane truth, fayth, constancie, mariage, and what soeuer Deltona would, that I meane: But thinke you I can liue in this fire vnconsumed, and see this excellencie without desiring? What should you desire? (replyed shee:) I hope you will not your selfe destroy your selfe; or affecting my estate, seeke to diminish my wealth: for if you like me for goodnesse sake, will you attempt to bereaue me of that goodnesse, whereby you would like no more? Farre be it from my fraylest imagination (sayd

                     Montanus) to prosecute any sinister meanes against your owne will: for by this Table of Contracts I sweare, I intend nothing lesse, nor applaud any thing more, then to behold you like a faire Planet in a beautious euening; or a pleasant Plant in a well manured ground. Then (concluded Deltona) except incontinent thoughts, and incongruent actions to honour, and my owne resolutions, vse the benefite of victorie with moderation; and so I confesse my selfe subiected: Yet let me know to whom, considering I determine to challenge the performance, as you enlarged the promise. First, (quoth Montanus) be this place, and these Statuas, witnesse of our League; &amp; Heauens confound the violation of our truce, &amp; maligners of our loues. With that they mutually imbraced ouer the Altar, according to the manner of Contracts; then kissed: and finding it a circumstance strengthening the band of Loue, kissed againe. Then Montanus sware to let his desire run no further at randome, then to chast entertainement, vntill conueniencie solemnised their Marriage: And Deltona protested, no alteration should dis

                      her opinion of him. Thus gaue Loue a plaudite to this meeting; and Successe seemed glad to be the period of such reciprocall liking: Yet Deltona perceiuing the place and opportunitie agreeing to his remembrance, which already procured certaine wanton changes, with a prettie kind of allurement enticed him out of doores;

which hee very carefully yeelded vnto, as well to maintaine her iudgement of his loialty, as to support his owne expectation for the fruition of such inestimable worth.
                  Heere met they with Coranus, who more then astonied at his Daughters being alone with Montanus, seemed so confounded, that they verily thought they had done amisse in being authors of his feare: but hee scorning the interception of euery obstacle quietly pacified him, that nothing had passed, wherein Verue and Honour was abused; nor shall any thing proceed without liberall satisfaction, if a Crowne and Kingdome may counterpoyze her worth. But this troubled him more, as suspecting hee was deluded, till Deltona razed out the scruple of Diffidence by making demonstration of his Princely demeanour; and reassured, nothing had, nor should impeach her vowes to Chastity, but death. Well (quoth Montanus) I see there are many entries, windinges, turnings, and difficulties in this Laborinth of Loue; and my owne Fortune tyreth mee with vnkind meditation; but I will dally no longer then to morrow, if you come to Placandus, a strange truth shall direct you into the plaine discouerie of my Story: But mischance once againe, to their better tryall, thus outfaced Delight, and interposed this crosnesse.

the Estern Fortona, and had questionlesse made appearance, from whence he proceeded: but that death stomaking his ouer boldnesse of his bodies constitution, as promising long life, cald him to an vnkind account, and in his manly progresse shewed the strength of a stronger arme, by which occation was this 
                           Rugio
                         left like waxe fit for any impresion to augment his prodecessors glory, or submit to the vanitie of his youth and liberty: but he, like a discreet traueler, that not presuming on his owne experience, chooseth a skilfull pilot for his iorny, selected men of honor and vertue to manage the affayers of his Realme, with whose assistance he made his gouernment compleat: the hope whereof induced Busimorus King of Bactriana, to bestow his Daughter Palestra vpon him in mariage, whom though his prerogatiue did not fully grace with the height of Maiestie, yet being a mighty and absolute Prince, flourishing in the very pride of yeares, and beautified with outward and inward excellencies: her loue and liking ouerswayed further conceite of ambition; so that shee liued to the great applause of the people, and indissoluble respect of the Duke, the rather, because she prooued a gladsome Mother of many towardly Children, had not a lamentable vntowardness disprooued her a Mother at all: For quietly trauelling in her hopes to see them prosper like men, shee was interdicted from making any further progresse by the archbaily of the Earth, who condemned

her as inexorable to his perpetuall mansion, whereby the princely Rugio had many causes of sorrow, and onely one of comfort in the expectation of her issue, to which he added this couenant, neuer to e
                        •…
                     angle his opinion with any stepmothers deceit: Thus remaining a widower, and assured of further succession, by reason his sons Philano and Kasteppi marched arme in arme before the colours of Honour, hee began to bee carelesse of a second wife, for that as a man graced with externall comelinesse, and other causes of entisement, he might either command a wanton Loue, or make choise of his owne satisfaction, and had he not in this maner ouer liberally payd tribute to his pleasure, surely both for gouernement ouer others, &amp; many choise accomplements in himselfe, he might well haue beene inserted in the Records of good Princes: yet this must be alleadged, the vice neuer grew so contagious, that it extended to spoile or rauishment, otherwise then as gifts and greatnesse compassed.
                  In the time of this wantonesse florished Deltona, amongst the Shepherds of Nagania, like an especiall flower in a curious Garden, on whom the worke man bestowed extraordinary cost and labour. To her amongst others, Franio, whether perswading himselfe to like, or because he would be thought capeable of some goodnesse, framed a motion of Loue: but she (as if you had seen a Cup presented to a man willing to drinke, and perceiuing

poisonin the bottome standeth amazed, and so desisteth, suddenly started backe, and hireing for the time an extraordinary scorne, assured him, she conceiued, that the heauens maligned, and the earth found him burdensome: with this answere, the cumbersome weeds of despight quickly choked and ouer-spread the fruit of true Loue, and so falling backe to his owne inclination, hee presently nourished a kinde of hate, and hate not onely wisheth ill, but oftentimes practiseth means of reuenge; though some Politicians more cunningly contriue their businesse, making the outside a false insinuation, and couertly worke vilainy and deceit: in which humour did Franio enter familiarity with Guleppo a man very neere the Duke, and for the performance of some pleasing matter of great trust with him: For you must vnderstand, Rugio did not so priuately satiate his inconinencie, but that diuers according to the libertie of that time, gaue their seuerall verdicts: some saying, sinne was intollerable in Princes, by reason example quickely reduced the people, and the persons gaue easier notice of their imperfections, like spots sooner seene in pure linnen, then courser cloth. Others would not dispute so vehemently, alleadging their actions had diuers Priuiledges, and themselues were sacred from reproch: some whispered; that a second marriage (considering his yeeres and abilitie) would diuert his carelessenesse of the common wealth to a more sufficient

regard: others alleadged his loue to his Children, (least the secret emulation of a Stranger might be preiudiciall) detayned him through diuers examples from subiecting them to a Stepmother: Some feared the expence of the Treasure, which must needes be too profusely consumed in charge of Apparrell, deuises, and rewards; others tooke in good part that course, because diuers priuate men were inriched, and the mony dispersed within the Dukedom: Some true louers of vertue (as farre as they durst) counselled the retreat to the secure fort of Moderation; others framed themselues to the Princes appetite, nere disputing who esteemed them else for bace and demisse: Of this sort was Guleppo, a man euer about the Duke, and imployed onely for matters of lasciuiousnes: To him did Franio declare the perfections of Deltona, and by way of circumstance, inferred the facility of the Rape, which might questionles be effected without infamy, danger, or repining. This brought him to secret conference with the Duke; who searching no further into the ground of his malice, supposed the fellow was willing to make a fortune by any course, and therefore with reward, for that time dismissed him. But presently proclaymed a generall Hunting, which corresponding with their Summer Feast, made him an eye witnesse of Franios description; and the first interuiew so pleased his apprehension, that hee tooke the benefite of the two dayes following; and to

colour his meaning, pitched vp diuers Tents, imparting the best of his game with a plentifull hand vnto them; and the honest Shepheards imputed his accesse to an honourable affability. Now when true Regard had thus satisfied his fancie, Opinion (though many times the mother of Errours) did not now deceiue his iudgement, but (as she was indeed) he supposed her excellent, &amp; without doubt of a better hope, then Coranus child. Heere some secret wrought a strange alteration; for Honour awaked the remembrance of Vertue, and assured him, it was not to be betraied to transitory vanity: yet loth to giue notice of any distemperature, hee commaunded a returne; and one time taking 
                        Guleppo aside, vrged him with inuention and endeuour to helpe his Lord and Master. But alas (for al his first confidence) he seemed as a man distracted at her admirable presence, rather then officious, like him, which hauing sore Eyes, and presuming on comfort by refusing his solitary Lodge, little knew the Sunne was more obnoxious vnto them) and protested hee was neuer so ouerwrought in conceit; for he vtterly despaired in the successe. Yet (quoth the Duke) thou shalt carry a Present to Coranus, &amp; a Iewel to Deltona; which accordingly he did: But as soone as his trembling feare had deliuered the message, al impatient she replied. Thou subtile enemy to frailty, &amp; bace broker of wantonnes; hence with thy trash, &amp; assure thy careles Master of honesty, that vertue remaineth like an inestimable

Diamond, which is still a pretious Stone, though neuer so meanely obscured, and content representeth a strong foundation; whereon lay what burden you will, it easily supporteth it. With this answere Guleppo against his will returned, and the Duke in a manner stomacked the contempt, had not the maner of the contempt made him suppose there was some excellencie she ment to keepe him from, which without doubt by the deniall inflamed him the more, and according to the nature of violence draue him without respect to goe to Coranus, assuring him by a Princes faith hee meant no circumuention, but an honourable marriage: this wrought his admittance to Deltona, who seeing shee was to wrastle with mightinesse durst not clogge her selfe with ouer many impediments, but with a Sence-rauishing Modestie appeared, as if shee had knowne her owne Metamorphosis, which so inflamed the amourous Prince, that with protestation of remaining a kind louing, and constant husband, hee perswaded her to accept of the Dutchy of Fortona.
                  
                  This offer Coranus wold haue taken hold of, as thinking it a happinesse from Heauen, that her Honour should be so well preserued, so prosperously reintegrated: and a fortune on Earth, that his feares and dangers should at last receiue their period; had not her answer amazed them both. Although (most mighty Prince) it were impossible for mee to deserue so great a portion of happinesse,

                        
so that in all wisedome I might welcome the blessing, as a donatiue from the Gods: yet hath a certaine resolution impugned all thoughts of mariage, and my Vowes tyed mee to the expectation of euerlasting quietnesse in a single life. Deltona refuseth to be Dutches of Fortona. By the small benefite of my Beautie (for which you haue let loose the streame of liberall Promises) I therefore expostulate at your hands, to remember your selfe, that is to pacific your Greatnesse, from being distempered with the denyall of inequalitie &amp; meannesse; if not, then let a hard hearted stubbornnesse assure, I wil admit of nomotions, tending to the disenabling of my poore resolutions.
                  This sharpe repulse much disquieted the Heroick Prince, and confounded the simple Coranus; yet the manner of her deliuerie, and grace-gracing Graciousnesse somewhat pacified (though not altered the passion: For hee reasoned, Coustome had taught Women deniall; and the strongest Townes with time and industrie were subiected: so with a kinde of impatient patience 
                        •…
                     e departed. But absence vsed him more vnkindly then other men, because by often iournies (which the vehemencie of his passion occasioned) he thought Fortune very spare; that still inticed him to the inchanting abode of beautie, and allowed him no charme to preuent the perill: hee complained on Loue as tyrannous, that bound his affection to an vnworthy subiect, and vrged against Nature, for being too too partiall; that shee against nature

should despise him with scorne, &amp; he (against reason) should prosecute a matter of such difficultie: so that euery thing (for the time) conspiring against him, the violence at last conspired against her; either by policie to allure her to the Court, where delicacie and pleasure might fashion her to other humours, or by strong hand to steale her away: for which purpose Guleppo for the Duke, and Franio for Guleppo; and both, as venemous spiders in an vnswept house, with industrious subtiltie attended, and as you haue heard, acted one part of the Tragedie already, which although diuers in a manner complained of: yet because it was a stone of the Dukes owne rowling, he made onely shew of mislike, neglecting indeed the true vse of mislike; somewhat discouering thereby the errors of greatnesse.
                  For men of power in this world sometime by strong hand beare out the actions of others hauing relation to their pleasure or profit: sometime extenuate the fault, &amp; by way of circumstance excuse the same; like artificiall Painters, whose greatest cunning consisteth in the curious shadowing of things, though the rich exclaime; and poore resemble them to flies escaping the Cobweb by strength, when the little ones are catched and destroyed: sometime in meere wilfulnesse they repugne reason and perswasion, either not perceiuing nor suffering other to tell their faults: or vnder colour of state, imagine it demisnesse to be attentiue

to each exbrobration: sometime finding the secret of delight to consist in varietie, one vice is quickly let in after another, and so the Brokers for the first are politickly discarded; like Flowers worne no longer then their scent lasteth; and new Factors cunningly admitted: sometime their affaires are managed with Alexanders fortune, who seeing the Gordion knot too intricate to vntie, shew'd the force of a strong arme to vncut. In which maner plaied now the Duke his game; for he embraced the deuiser of this Plot with gladnes, &amp; put it in practise with speedinesse, so that he welcommed the next Sunne in solemne intercessions, not to obscure his face the day following, &amp; hasted to the ambush accordingly, wherein an houres tediousnes had not detained thē, before Franio gaue the watch-word, Il tempo, &amp; they leauing their couert The Duke stealeth away Deltona. suddenly surprised Coranus and his daughter, as an vnlook't for tempest turneth the sailes about, when the sight of harbour cheereth the poore afflicted Sailers. By this means is the Duke in possession of his much desired happines, &amp; seeing her aduanced vp before him, cōmanded away; none remaning but the aged Coranus weeping, &amp; diuellish Fran

                        o laughing. But who had beheld the beautious Deltona in this captiuitie, would haue sworne constancy meant to out-braue mischance, and an honourable minde was not to be suppressed with misfortune? For she was not altered, nor much dismaied, only stomacking to be so circumuented, in his armes thus spake.

Traytour both to vertue and Maiestie, take heed of an intent of wickednesse, least deuine Iustice gather all the seruants of Reuenge against thee, as for the least hope to expect any thing, but hate and disdaine; let my scorne of thy presumption make thee answere; but concerning the thought of wantonnesse, by the euer-reuerenced Marpesia, I sweare these handes shall first rende out my heart, and throw it in thy face. Be not so extream, sweet and faire Deltona answered the Duke, I protest nothing is meant against thy chastest wishes: be onely pacient and moderate, letting time worke his will, thou beeing willing vnto tinnes working. Thus hee brought her to Fortona, and indeed (as if he had knowen her to be the mightiest Empresse of the world) gaue order for her entertainement accordingly.
                  NOw playeth Report her part, for mingling certainties with vntrueths the vprore of the The Duke stealeth away Deltona through Franios mischieuous deuice, who is slaine in the businesse. Citie, and the muttering of the people, shuffled together many and strange opinions: because a seldomnesse of doing amisse, maketh small faults wondred at; and the fauour of the partie wronged striketh a compassion, which quickly breedeth scandall and repining: For how-euer fauour or power may support an vniust Action, or protect an Offender from the penaltie of the Law; yet can wise men see the conniuencie, and the better sort will exclaime on the partialitie.
                  
                     
This appeared in the Dukes stealing away of Deltona; at which some murmured, and diuers presumed to reprehend the incontinencie. Amongst whom the youthfull Egerius Minion to Philano the Dukes elstest Sonne; as if some naturall respect compelled the remorce, assured the Prince, that the Duke much impayred his renowne to deale so violently with such modesty and goodlinesse. Peace (quoth Philano) be aduised in the reprehention of Princes; yet because thy vertue is pure without diffused compounds, I ouerpasse the inuection: and seeing thou desirest shee should be choycely intreated, I protest to loose the benefite of my birth-right, before shee haue cause to complaine.
                  This Egerius was sonne of a Stranger named Bertosas, dwelling in the Citty, whom those attractiue Vertues, which grace Princes themselues, did so accompany, that all men affoorded him their loue and liking; and the Duke applauded his Sonnes choyce. Thus for the time, was Deltona quieted, the Duke in some hope, his Sonne in strange expectation, and Egerius in a kind of repining: But thus is Coranus in all despaire; as much vexed with Franios laughing, as his Daughters losse, whereupon hee hasted to Placandus, and stuttered out the matter to Montanus, as though feare had made him forget an orderly methode, yet not omitting Franios despight, who indeede (supposing mischiefe vnsufficient without bosting

of it) followed grinning and clapping his hands: but when Montanus had heard him out; like the Kings of Beasts, who once enraged roareth and beateth the ground with his taile, not in the nature of lamentatiō, but because he cannot be reuenged: so stormed hee, and seemed in such manner wrathfull, that the rest trēbled: for without further reasoning, taking onely his simple she ephooke, he flung out of doores and almost at the house met with Franio crying, Deltona was gon, and darest thou Villaine, (quoth he) triumph in such a losse? with all letting a blow flee at his head; either feare, or the smart; or feare of more smart, made him fall, wherein his cowardly submission discouered the fault: But Montanus bade him dispatch, leauing tediousnesse and falsehood: With that, hee began his discourse, had not the other interrupted him, exclaiming; Oh deuine Iustice? Let not my cares be defiled with this wretched breath-broker nor my hands forbeare to purge the earth of such a venemous monster; but let him perish in his own shames, least others bee impoisoned with his infections, and mischieuous life. This hee vttered with great fury, and fury not passing without action, strucke with such quicknesse at his head, that the braines spurted from their broken inclosure: The death of Franio. which not regarding, hee hasted toward Fortona, and hast encreasing distemperature, gaue him no leisure to meditate on the diffusednesse of his iourney. But when Coranus was assured of his departure,

he corected his owne slacknesse, that made no more haste, considering the many secrets and strange occurrents, which his onely knowledge must discouer: where vpon hee followed with speede.
                  Now what estate was poore Placandus in, who left alone with dead Franio, and seeing the Hurlyburly had gathered the Inhabitants together, knew not which way to excuse the murther, nor durst beginne any circumstances, but the plaine truth; which after his reuerent Age had reuealed, and the pittifull story, with an vnkinde scope deciphered the wickednesse, they quickly conuerted all suspition &amp; hatred for Franios death into counsell, the strength of comfort, and chiefest proppe of Placandus life. Why then (quoth hee) am I indeed reuiued, that like men, like honest men, like honest wise men you wil accord vnto reason; and like friends, yea true-hearted friends, you will not faile in aduersitie: let vs therefore giue the dead his due Ceremonies, and liue our selues in good hopes, that Montanus and Coranus will returne with glad tydings. But other affaires detaine them beyond expectation, and we must hast to Fortona, to know the certaintie.

And in Montanus, of Loue and Anger; his Loue, supposing nothing impossible to be attempted; his Anger, assuring to be compassed, what so euer might be attempted: and thus went hee forward vnaccompanied, vntill Coranus ouertooke him entring into the Towne, which they found full of rumours by reason of the accident. This imboldned him to bid Montanus stay awhile: for Wilfulnesse repenteth, when Reason openeth the eyes of Vnderstanding, and his Counsell must be the Threed to direct him out of this Laborinth. Counsell how you will (quoth Montanus,) so it tende to recouer Deltona. Then must you be attentiue a while (replyed Coranus;) for strange and dangerous is the Storie. Is it time

now (answered hee) to tell tales, or to tryfle? No, no: Pleasure and conceites are not sutable to this feate and haste: besides, in matters of necessitie, delay openeth the sluce of Inconuenience. Tush (sayd Coranus) you mistake mee much. But O eternall Powers! whom doe my eyes behold? Coranus meeteth his brother Bertosus in Fortona.

                     fellow Bertosus? With that, they saluted a comely Old man of the Cittie, who mooued with the first vprore, and like a right Naturalist thirsting after Newes, posted to the Court to be beholding to Truth: for hauing a Sonne named Egerius, of secret respect with the princely Philano the first borne of the Duke, hee presumed on his knowledge and credite; but thus intercepted by Coranus, whom in thirteene yeares hee had not seene, nor euer supposed to haue seene, as long since seeing the neuer satisfied Ocean swallow him vp, hee was confounded: the strangenesse making them both as strange, vntill the extasie moderated, gaue Remembrance leaue to play her part; then appeared Knowledge and Comfort in full life; and after a second ceremony of kindnesse tuned the organs of Speech to this purpose. But doth Brizaca liue (quoth Bertosus?) I, if Trezoboro be preserued (said Coranus?) Then hath the Gods mightily fauoured (Coranus replyed) Bertosus. And miraculously protected Bertosus, (answered Coranus.) Now was Montanus astonied; for these new names, increased new thoughts; and the strangenesse

of the nouelty rebated his first heate, distempering him with a trembling desire. Oh (said Coranus) now shall you heare a discourse of some trouble! bee therefore more considerate (good Montanus) and let Bertosus salute thee. With that, a mannerly ceremony passed betweene them, vntill Bertosus counselled to returne to his house, where the benefite of Aduice might be thus farre aduantagious vnto them, that the Duke made acquainted with the matter, would questionlesse proceed in a new course.
                  But ere they were entred into a full passage of speech Egerius all ready enamoured on the excellent Deltona, &amp; tormented to se another in possession of his delight, came home to his father very sad: yet was he the sadder for comming home, because ignorant, whom his father accompanied, his determination of solitarinesse seemed disappointed; and but that the gallantnesse of Montanus, as it were naturally attracted a respect, his first course had entertained a further fullennesse: yet being a Courtier, who seeme to be the professors of humanity, &amp; indeed arrogate to themselues the essential knowledge of curtesie and good manners, but especially induced by some regardable appearance, hee saluted them with a very good grace; whereby delight it selfe seemed to play in the greeting. For Egerius countenance (not so much as down'd with the difference of Sexes) kept an extraordinary grauity, &amp; Montanus comelynesse

an vnaccustomed temperature, which pleased Egerius, and Egerius pleased Montanus; who demanded many questions tending rather to necessitie then curiositie, answered without ambiguitie or circumstance.

                      out the very secrets of their knowledge, and concluded to participate the same to Egerius, who hauing the greatest interest in the matter might remember himselfe, and remember the Duke, that Deltona was farre surpassing her selfe; wherupon Bertosus not without a reuerent contrarietie taking 
                        Egerius by the hand, thus began. If the Gods had not their Iudgements inscrutible, and vnited to supernaturall power, a prerogatiue beyonde mans capacitie, wee might slightly estimate their mightinesse, and step into presumption of our industry: but because they will giue vs notice of their all working preeminence, miraculous and strange accidents draw vs to admiration, and that men may be subiected, euen the greatest estates feele the scourge of affliction: This appeare thin the Discourse now intended. For concerning your selfe; no longer Sonne, nor Egerius, but Egerius and Deltona discouered to be brother and sister, the Emperour of Trebizonds 
                           〈◊〉

And concerning vs no longer the reputed fathers of Mengrelius children, but loyall vassals to the Emperour of Trebizonda. With that he vnfolded many intricate circumstances of

his birth, losse, and fortune; whereby it appeared, that Egerius was sonne to the Emperor Mengrelius of Trebizond, by the name of Trezoboro; that Deltona was his twin Sister and called Brizaca; and Coranus with Bertosus were brothers, to whose trust the charge of their infancie was committed.
                  But thinke you, did Montanus heare this? or did hee wonder at the hearing? or remayned he silent at the wondring? or seemed hee amazed in the silentnesse? Surely he heard, wondred, kept silence, and

the next morning they accompanied him to the court, &amp; Egerius saluting the princely Philano, was answered as if loue had in sumpathy pleased one another. Then (quoth Egerius,) let this loue acquaint the Duke, that a matter of importance is to be discussed, and how I am to impart the circumstance. Heere omitted friendship no part of her dutie; for the willing Philano presented himselfe before his Father, and certified their accesse and the cause.
                  But whether a feare to be preuented of enioying Deltona made euery conceit a suspition of her hazzard, or some vncomfortable misdoubt fore-tolde anothers interest to the thing he vsurped; he quite degenerated from his owne Customes: vntill Philano seeing his Egerius attend vnregarded, conferred againe with the Duke; and he sommoning his Counsell, as if the Common-wealth claimed a redresse, was at last ouer-ruled by them to pensil out his vertue in more liuely colours: whereupon Egerius encouraged, when the day of hearing lifted vp her head to be seen, aduanced his speech to be thus vnderstood.
                  AFter Samarchanus (most mighty Duke) sonne The History of Mengrelius and Kalucki. of Rhecus, Sonne of Demorgus, the ancient Inhabiter of the Caues of Sarmatia, had reduced his people to a ciuilitie by his discipline, and with the example of valour countenanced their courages; hee attempted the Empire

of Terbizonda, and preferred for preuailing, so relied on their obedience and loialties, that Colchidos, Pontus, Iberia, and Capadocia were also subiected, with which renowned; a time of peace afforded him leisure to recompence the time of his paines with the reward of delight. But he apprehending the royaltie of other Monarchies, applyed himselfe to immitation; neuer desisting, till hee had his Gouernment and Court, a very Nursery of state and glory: so that you might lawfully haue giuen that Lustrum the preeminence, considering the people had the practise and obseruation of glorious things, and Samarchanus himselfe seemed a man compleat in all circumstances of prosperitie.
                  For concerning the gifts of the minde, they were such rare qualities, as contained more vertue in their operation, then shew in the worke-manship: yet such work-manship as made adellicare obiect to the eye, and enriched the possessor. His direction in publicke affayres consisted of such parts, that very aspiring mindes rather submitted to him, then soothed their owne ambition; and in his priuate Court the pallace was a receptacle of the nobly disposed, and well enclined attendants, whom neerenesse to the Prince, made rather study for his Honour, then their owne pleasure: His state commanding affection, for moderation of greatnesse, rather then feare for mightinesse of power; yet was his power of such sufficiencie, that diuers Kingdomes were in tributorie

subiection: His libertie admitted Millitary exercise and honourable expenses, neither lauish to satisfie a vaine ostentation; nor too sparing, to discouer any defect that way, His goodnes in generall a sufficient subiect to talke of; and in particular so many by-wayes to perfection.
                  As for Fortunes portion, she distributed it with a plentifull hand, and contrary to her selfe, with a iudiciall foresight: His Territories many and rich; yet none so rich as well gouerned: His Magnificense augmented in goodly Buildings, and costly furniture; yet neither so much respected, as their orderly vse obserued: His Treasure amassed by regardable prouidence without exactions or cruell penalties: not yet omitting, what princely bounty should remember; nor admitting, what powerfull licentiousnesse might inferre: His royaltie beautified with ceremonious pompe and regall necessitie, his happinesse consummate in a glorious Queene, towardly Succession, honourable Allies, dutifull Attendants, sure Subiectes, and friendly Neighbours.
                  Touching the Bodies alowance, the first Parent of the earth boasted in her owne workmanship; for his Liniaments had a decent vniformity, and Fauour triumphed to be setled in Maiestie: His Countenance retained as well an amiable Chearefulnesse, as manly Grauitie; yet neither enclined the one to childish Effeminatenesse, nor the other to secure Exaltation▪ His Speech was euer reposed,

and the manner of his cariage such, as neither shewed any wrested motions of Bountie, nor degenerating conditions of Princely demeanor: and although the continuance of a long age might haue brought her accustomed tediousnesse; yet health corresponded to his lustinesse, and an able body emboldned him to the naturall discharge of his Fancie; so that the greatest were his fauorites, &amp; the yong Russian Dutchesse Balutasa his Spouse. Of whom (most excellent Duke) the curiostest Rhetoricke will rather manifest a willingnesse, then abilitie to speake; and in whose prayses the best sufficiencie will shorten the iorney to her estimate. For in beeing so great a person, her worth appeared the more, (like an illustrious Carbuncle set out to the best purpose, that wee may perceiue how Art can beautifie Nature; and because a reuerent loue tempered other passions with Reason, shee liued famous to the world, and gracious to Samarchanus, ioyning to other blessinges goodly Sonnes, and fayre Daughters; deuided into such couples, that for Men, who might compare with Kalucki and Mengrelius: for Women, who could match with Arcabella and Pisana.
                  
                  These being the choyce fruite of a flourishing Graft had perfected the beauty of this Garden, and made an vpshot to prosperitie, but that the contention for a Kingdome eclipsed the glorious

sunshine; and disdaine of partnership in the wearing of a Crowne, ware out the print of blessed continuance: Yet did the life of their Father containe ill will within limitation, and his death make the strife the greater; because it was for such a soueraignety. For no sooner payde Samarchanus his debt to Nature, yeelding to the sommons of not so hasty, as vndalliable a Commaunder, leauing Balutasa in sorrowfull mightinesse, his Children in doubtfull expectation, his Subiects in suspition of now troubles, his adioyning Confederats in opportunitie of reuolt, and euery one fearing their owne losse, by the losse of so good a Prince: But Kalucki through the prerogatiue of his Birth-right, claymed the Diademe; which clay me was yet reclaymed by the great working spirit of Mengrelius, and partiall affecting loue of Ballutasa, who imboldned with her alliance in Russia, and the Northen Europa: but especially presuming on her sonnes vertues; with which he had drawne out the peoples loues to the greatest length, resolued to endeauour his aduancement, so much more gracing him, by how much opinion thought him to surpasse Kalucki, not differing from our kinde of Cockering mothers, which commonly dally with the yongest, &amp; without apparant reason make sometimes their affection partiall: yet had not her wilfullnesse been caryed with so strong a current, if other stepps had not helped her vp, as some speciall coadiutors, amongst

whom Corambello Duke of Raganda, Putrasso Steward of the Pallace, and Hardubax Lord of seauen Ilands, were men of great sufficiencie. This made her goe forward, and her forwardnesse bade him not faint in the proiect; whereupon incited with his Mothers resolution on the one side, and the glory of the exployt on the other, hee prosecuted a wonderfull attempt, and she sommoned the assembly of estates, vrging many reasons for the preferring of Mengrelius.
                  
                  But Kalucki all impatient at so vnlookt for beginning stood amased, rather sullen with anger, then affrighted with feare, till at last, the generall silence (for who durst presume in a cause of such importance) reduced his distemperature to conceiue, that if the proiect were a matter premeditated, she then had a faction prepared, and his sufficiency was doubtfull: But if it were onely a Mothers partialitie, hee supposed by the intimation of Treason, and the penaltie to depose her Regencie, and contract their Securitie by honorable insinuation. Why Lords (sayd he) shall Samarchanus liuing so well, be now rewarded so ill? that daring not presume to immagine him the least wrong, you now goe about the greatest iniurie, by manifest repugnancie to neglect his appoyntment, and odious defamation to disenable his Sonne? And Mother, (though vnworthy the least letter in so louing a word) either will it fall out to your shame to dishonour so well deseruing a Husband: or to my

proch to be vpbrayded with Bastardie? else can neither the law of Nature preferre any besides my selfe; or of Nations giue so much as a colour to a younger Brother. But as for you, whom stricter alleageance combineth to the obseruation of our state and person, wherein dare you hassard your selues, &amp; suffer Iudgement to be abused, as though you respected not, whether the drinke were poyson, so it be brought in a Golden cupp? As though Mengrelius, because more effeminate, were therefore more fitte to reuenge your wronges: And Kalucki (because a peeuish Woman, thinketh not so fashionable) must therefore be disseised of his Birth-right? Take heed in time, as yet your Prouidence may dam vp the fluce of our Iustice: but if you suffer your selues to be carried against your duties; by death I sweare, no submission shall make an attonement. Now to you Sir: (an vnpleasant countenance threatning his Brother with a following mischiefe) remember that Principalitie abideth no concurrent; and prosecuteth an Enemie to confusion. Besides, the name of a Traytor, resembleth a consuming Leprosie, which infecteth all the body, and leaueth scandall to posteritie. Doe not hassard therefore the benefite of life, by vaine Securitie; Nor be so besotted to thinke, that a fleeting looke, or bace popularitie can alien the loyalties of so many trustie Subiects: But assure you, I challenge this Empire as hereditarie; thy selfe for a Subiect, the rest obedient, and all confederats

assistant. Thus somewhat forgetting his first intent of moderation, hee approached the royall Throne, and had without interruption ascended, but that Ballutasa interceded, and in this manner set the fire of Rebellion on a blase.
                  
                  
                     I deny not but thou mayest boast, as the immediate successor of Samarchanus, and wast in times past reputed as a blessing to a Mother: But doe not thinke wee are so simple and inconsiderate, that hauing the choyce of two seueralles, to admit the vnworthiest. I doe therefore without euasion or circumstance, condemne thee for froward and badly disposed; and coniure these rather to take compassion on the prostrate necessitie of the Common-wealth, then pitty thee for a priuate complaint, seeing those degenerating humours, which make Princes odious, are already ripened in thee: the remembraunce whereof hath exasperated my displeasure, and mooued these to remooue thee, as preiudicate. Besides, it is the will of the Gods to aduance a Steward, which may husband their Plenty, and not ruine their Inheritances. How can it then equipage mine Honour, that the name of a fonde affectionate Mother, should make mee forget the dutie of a prouident Princesse? Wherefore you louers of Goodnesse, it is for your sakes, I digresse from my selfe, and for the common prosperitie I disable Kalucki; considering Obedience is rather the seruant of Vertue, then titular Dignities;

which can seldome be incident, where Deformitie maketh loathsome. Pride ouermastreth, Hear

                  But as a forward bitternes might haue aggrauated his disgraces; the wrathfull first borne of this disquietted Queene in impatience made a sudden approach vnto her, and directed a most dangerous blow (for by this time quicknesse had vnsheathed the blade,) as if the vnpleasing messenger of Reuenge meant to proclaime the strange death of an Empresse, had not Mengrelius waled with his owne body, and by securing her, sustayned the smart of a grieuous wound; whereby seeing the fire was kindled, hee betooke him to his Guard; and making forward, had the assistance of other coadiutors. Now when Kalucki perceiued the gates of Treason were set open, hee exclaymed on the mischiefe, and commaunded the true louers of their Prince to performe their duty. Wherevpon many set them selues on worke, and the place bred rather confusion, then the confusion dispatch; so that euery one shuffled vp some action or other. Mengrelius set Pollicie and Valour on worke to extenuate the furie: Kalucki countenanced Rage and Despight to punish the reuolters: As for the rest; some pressing forward could neither auoyde a pitious slaughter, nor keepe possession for the body to stand vpright: others (vnwilling to be so endangered) were ere the

midst of the hall had shortned their iorney, either in the throng stifled, or by the commers in, compelled backe: Some vsed such weapons for necessity, which in quietnesse were borne but of fashion; others hauing none wrested from such, as could not resist: Some tooke the Pallace furniture, as not regarding how they helped them selues; others made euery thing offensiue, as not caring how they iniured the rest: Some exclaymed on the reuolt, crying, The Gods protect Kalucki; others ready to innouation, wished Mengrelius Emperour: Some with vnseasonable wisedome perswade a pacification; others with strange hearts fraughted with Treason, ran away with the violence.
                  THus was a dangerous vnquietnesse begun Kalucki dispossessed of the Empire by his younger brother Mengrelius: seateth himselfe in the further Tartary. with a few mens deaths, which no doubt had ended with the losse of many mens liues, had not Carambello, Putrasso, and Hardubax, taken the cause in hand for the Empresse, and by force ouermastred Kalucki: For Carambello rather addicted to Rallutasas wilfulnesse, then fearing the diuision of the Empire, made yet this feare a colour of his pa

                     iality, and so contriued the matter, that Kalucki co
                        •…
                     sented to a surceance of his rightfull claime, and subscribed to a compulsiue deposition: This necessitie conuented, and the day of truce in Bellonas Temple ratefied these particulars.
                  That Mengrelius should raigne during life: but

                     Kaluckies successors, or him sealfe ouerliuing to reposses the Diadem.
                  
                  That Kalucki, and as many as would make tryall of his fortune, after certaine summes of mony disbursed should within twenty dayes depart the territories of the Empire, and within twenty howeres the Verge of the Court:
                  That if Mengrelius by the benefit of maryage were blessed with the effect of mariage, the comfort to be frustrate in losse of their liues, and the name of a Father forgotten in respect of the Male children:
                  That if Kalucki taking notice of these couenants infringed, within one yeere conuicted not the cleceite, the gouernment to remaine subiect to election, and no man culpable to resist any vnestablished:
                  That no subiect to the Empire, should repine at these particulars, and the abettors of any couen remaine faultie, as in case of high Treason:
                  Thus was Kalucki compelled to take his farwell of an ingratefull Country, and disobedient people: But magnanimity showing rather a scorne then a grudging at their disloialties, left them with out ceremony to the reproch of their errors, and posted to the hope of better fortune, wherein his expectation was not deceiued. For no sooner abandoned he these Confines, but hee was acceptable to other Countries: and the place, which af

                     Tartary, a place yeelding a receptacle for his state and with a strange fortune opening the Gates of the magnificent Coralla to his wishes. Heere in short time, hee prooued a worthy soiorner, the Country reioycing, where hee remayned; and the world trembling, whither his fame was dispersed. For honorable industrie increased Riches, Riches amplication, amplication reuerence, and reuerence feare; which though against others engendred hate, yet toward him, was the cause of loue, in regard hee was loth to acquaint them with any displeasing Newnes; and they respectious to giue no occasion of inconsiderat neglect: but remained in one vnitie of loue, as hee did in one method of discipline.
                  When Mengrelius saw his Ioy triumph ouer Anoyance, and that hee had leasure to actuate his Ambition, he proclaimed a publike Celebration, as if he meant to make the day of this Peace, a glorious Feastiuall, whereby the people were acquainted with vnacquainted Ceremonies, &amp; confirmed the manner of the State, knowing when to appoynt, and to whom proportion both Honour and respect. This was made manifest, because they solemnised his Coronation with willingnesse, beautified his Pompe with cost, augmented his Triumph with Presents, and diuulged their good Opinion with acclamations. And truly (most mighty Duke) wheth

Report; or that his Fathers example suborned his industry, hee performed so many things tending to perfection, that euery one adored him as a God in the world, and magnified the time as the yeares of true comfort, wherein hee might haue tempted the reuenger of all contempt with scorne of alteration, had not remembrance of the Oath to his Brother, and Couenaunts to Carambello, 
                     dashed out all ouerboldning conceites: much like an Aprill tempest chancing in a moment to the dismay of a Gardner, boasting of a sun-shyning morning to grace his handy worke; this strocke a pensiuenesse for a time, and did indeed add an outward countenance of demission: For considering, that in hauing a Wife, the blessing of a Wife was to be quite extinguished; and the name of a Mother a most wretched title in her owne Children, by reason of their murder: Who could but tremble at the conceit, and exclaime on the vnaduisednesse of such enforcement? Till at last, Time the consumer of all things, ware out the print of that feare. Youth, the maintayner of Carelesnesse, would needes haue recourse to Pleasure: Nature, an enemie of Deuises, scorned to be counterchecked with Appoyntment: Fortune, the Mistris of of Alteration, stomaked the stedfastnesse of mans Proposing: and Loue, the Father of Fancie, raged to be suppressed with a peeuish Promise: Wherevpon they conspired in a league, and brought him to the house of Wantonnesse; where he was welcommed

according to his worth, and ouer-esteemed for his wealth and greatnesse. For whether hee meant to satiate an incontinent liberty, heere were such, as knew the power of a Princes dalliance; or whether hee meant to limit his affection to a vertuous choyce, heere were such as secured chastity with a victorious army of good thoughts; but when that Iudgement was to be giuen, though his communication extended to variety of disport, hee onely liked his sister Arcabella to their greater despight; whom fauour for beautie, beautie for countenance, countenance for comelinesse, comelinesse for delight, and all for Maiestie, had so extraordinarily graced, that neither kindred interposed her neerenesse, nor conceit of mischance to come rebated his desires, but hee made tryall of her modestie, and layde downe his Crowne as the rewarde of consent: and shee considering that Menarelius marieth his sister Arcabella. Emperours make no Prentishipp of their Contracts, without delay or nicetie, tooke hold of opportunities hayrie top.
                  Thus was the Mariage happily concluded, and speedily celebrated with glorious Triumphs belonging to state, and stately continuance appropriate to Kings, so that Ballutasa as a gladsome Mother reioyceth, and Arcabella as a happy wife is comforted, till requited with an husbandly duty; and making shew to the world of an irrecouerable losse by her swelling Wombe, an vnkind remembrance checked her iollity, and affoorded occasion

to others in this manner to descant. What meanes Mengrelius now, to performe the couenant so vnnaturally graunted? or violate his oath so dangerously made? Shall an Emperour be a bloody executioner of his owne Childe? or a Tyrant ouer his Country? Must Trebizouda be reproched for immanitie, or reprooued for perfidiousnesse? Can it stand with naturall pietie to destroy faultlesse Infants? or regardable Honour to tryfell out so strange a composition? Surely Content repineth at the inequalitie: For either shall Kalucki haue occasion of new Warre, or a wretched Murder continue an old Peace.
                  NOtwithstansting these doubts, though Arcabella might haue made him a ioyfull Father, Mengrelius killeth his first Sonne. yet he ere nine howers; caused her to be a sorrowfull mother. For the Child was marked to the house of death, as soone as the birth gaue notice of his sexe; which done, vnkindly pacified. Arcabella vuderstood it must be so; and the too late repenting, Balutasa was assured it should be so. Thinke not yet any outward Maske so obscured the continuance of sorrow; but many perceiued the Emperours allacritie dulled, and the very life of the Court discouraged. As for Arcabella, whom dellicatenesse made more subiect to griefe, griefe manifested in her the effect of griefe, sadnesse, and teares, which by reason of neglect, resembled Spots

For though he impugned the iourney by many arguments, yet at the last he promised Arcabella to go in person, and sealing the couenant with an amorous kisse dismissed her, to entertaine a greater delight, and applyed himselfe to the conuenient dispatch of the Progresse.

but one person in both, though parted in motion: so the mindes of both grew with their bodies to a Sunpathy,
                      and resembled sweet musicke made by the well tuning the strings, onely their names accorded to this difference, that Cusanach taught Xantippus the dutie of a sonne, and Soltimos shewed Encelidon the affection of a father: and surely how euer greatnesse breedeth many times contempt, the secret enemy of conuersation, and absolute hinderer of former amitie: yet heere did the fathers liue without grudging, and the sonnes proportion their affections accordingly; as not debarred by the distance of their dwellings from counter-changeable meetings, and inseperable familiaritie, in eating, lying, liuing, and louing together; keeping time in their actions, as if they had determined to conclude some woonder of friendship in the world, and indeed appeared like Twinne-brothers of one mother; both in habite, fashion, demeanour, and what circumstances soeuer may make any thing like another: yea, it grew to that rare and admirable effect, that when Xautippus had with strange conflicts resisted his passion, least the loue of Eucasta, beautious Eucasta, and in being beloued of Xantippus fortunate Eucasta, should deuide the loue of his friend, he yet continued the same Xantippus, and would not permit Encelidon to depart from Xantippus, nor could indeede Encelidon digest any thing, but what liked Xantippus.
                  
                  
                     
AT last Fortune despighted to behold such a mirrour of immutability, bribed the sonne of Venus, (as the Poets vse to sing) to sow the seedes of Diuision; which how euer they rooted, were sprinkled in Encelidons heart, and began to spring forward, as sweetned with the graces of Eucasta, which like the translucent beames of so me fayre Planet, shewed tokens of admiration, rather then knowledge: so that Encelidon could not but loue Eucasta, Eucasta could not but like Encelidon, because hee was like Xantippus, and Xantippus loued Eucasta the better for liking Encelidon; till the controuersie grew betwixt a passion ouerruling Reason, and true Friendship ouermastring Idle humors: But when Encelidon perceiued no way of comfort, but by beeing a traytor to Zantippus, friendship preuayled, and hee chose rather to die, then to be found dissoyall; so that after many circumstances of discontentment, hee would haue killed himselfe, had not the working of his spirit compelled the tongue to intreat Death not to be too too cruell; by which occasion with the fortune of ouerlooking his de

                     neanor, Xantippus was made acquainted with the errour of Encelidon, and Encelidons distraction exposed both feare and trouble: yet the admirable innated loue expelled the combersome enemies of his quiet. Ielosie and Mistrust, and by way of kindnesse, hee expostulated with Encelidon the cause of his griefe, distemperature, and now desperate

                        
attempt: But as you see a guiltie man disconsolare with the iudgement of Conscience and Law concluding his finall end: so stood Encelidon hauing nothing to answere, but amazing lookes, and a deiected countenance, wherein Xantippus might read the mischiefe pretended, and by his abashed vnwillingnesse to reueale, found (and at last compelled him so to confesse) the first discouerie to be true.
                  
                     Encelidon had no sooner cursed the day of his Birth, Fortune, Loue, Heauen, Earth, and Hell, that thus had tonspired against his Fayth; but faynted with remorce, and as if he would plead the defect of Nature, not Malice, fell downe in Xantippus armes, and bade him not spare to ridd the world of such a wretch. But hee in a strange contrarietie comforted him with preuention, and that there was nothing remedilesse; yea coniured him by all the names of life, manhood, setled loue, inseperable contracts, and what else a sweete oratory might inferre, to rayse vp his spirits; and if need were, not to desist: For although his infamy and dishonor must leaue a scandall to Xantippus in his partialitie; yet what would hee not doe to saue the life of Encelidon: Cheare thy selfe therefore, and onely change the name of Encelidon, and Eucasta can know no other, but that thou art Xantippus: For Xantippus onely can discouer, who is Encelidon. Bee not dismayde, I prise thee at a great rate; and rather then Encelidon should miscarry, Xantippus
                     
will be without Eucasta. Heere grew the contention betweene them to some vnpleasant particulars; the one pleading for Death, the other scorning euery thing but his Friends life: At last perswasion, some reasons, and Xantippus enforcement, compelled him to take the name of Xantippus 
                     vpon him, and so the loue of Eucasta ouercame his feare, and brought him to reape the Haruest of his strange desires. But when Loue came to florish his Colours, (Oh pardon the fortune and errour of Passion) how could those beauties appeare? How could those sweet embracements continue? How could that euer burning impression remaine in stilnesse, and hee not be thankefull to successe for the same? Yet fly Friendship from sight of this treason. For Encelidon like a man rauisht fell senselesse in the armes of Eucasta, and Eucasta confoun ded at Xantippus extasie, striued to helpe, and helped when shee knew how, though shee little knewwhom; till at last (as no extremitie can last) Encelidon recouered some life, &amp; with passionate teares shewed tokens both of trembling feare, and enraging desire: but pittifull Eucasta wretched in the ignorance of her Xantippus distemperature, accompanied him with a sadder weeping. Now when Encelidon saw to what straights hee had driuen his Barke, and that the delight of his soule was disquieted with the errour, all impatient hee discouered hee was Encelidon, and not Xantippus; leauing out no circumstance, which either might reueale his

loue, or publish the glory of his Friend, beseeching her to loue him nere the worse for taking this course in her loue; nor Xantippus the lesse for louing his friend; nor her selfe for being beloued of Encelidon, who had once made choyce of death, had not the loue of Eucasta perswaded life, and Xantippus commanded, that Encelidon should liue. But alas, Eucasta durst not trust her owne sences; she heard the voyce of Xantippus, she saw the shape of Xantippus, she felt the motions of Xantippus; onely he sware he was Encelidon. Some times she feared a pollicy to try her weaknesse: some times her feare accompanied with Ielosie, that Xantippus mistrusted her Constancie: some times a pretty kind of anger sware to Xantippus, this was too great vnkindnesse: some times shee entreated him to desist from this circumuention: and at last on her knees coniured him by the secrets of her loue, to loue his Eucasta, to bee her Xantippus, and suffer Eucasta to bee nones, but Xantippus: till Encelidon added the oaths of the sunne, and by other circomstances of more particularitie brought her to the right path of vnderstanding, that shee was resolued it, was Encelidon. This a while her patience forbare to stomach, and loue to her Husband forbade to discouer: But as when you see the Fire put out by supposing the Ashes to couer and hide the same, and yet the next day some Sparkes of life are remayning

by remoouing their Veyle. So fared it with Eccasta, shee wisely raked in her Discontent with the coldest Embers shee could, till Misfortune brought her to tosse them abroad, and then appeared, that the fire was not quite extinguished; that her conceite was not altogeather eased, but stomaching more and more to be so betrayed, shee acquainted her mother Iugeroth with the History from the beginning: A woman of that working spirit, that if the Country had affoorded meanes of setting Ambition on worke, shee would haue scorned the name of a Subiect: A woman so imperious in her will, that no action was vnattempted, nor after the attempt vndetermined, which might add wings to her desires, though sometimes they tended to lasciuiousnesse: A woman of that implacabillity, that once subiect to the error of mislike, before she would admitte of remiission, she dared discouer an absolute mallice: A woman of that apprehention, that the least abuse was an indignity to her house, &amp; then followed a prosecution of reuenge: This appeared in the discourse of the fearefull Eucasta; the memory whereof stroke such impression, that the impatient Iugeroth without care of Conscience in plaine tearmes vrged the Murder of Xantippus, and to be effected by the hand of Encelidon: nor desisted shee from reason and argument, as the breach of Honour, the hate of her Husband, continuall heart-burning, secret mislikes, the discouery abroad, and the renowne of the reuenge,

                        
as if because the body was distempered through the paine of the Head, no other remedy serued, but to bereaue it of his capitall member without further search of redresse.
                  
                  To this was Eucasta soone perswaded, as supposing her honour and renowne ecclipsed, yea broken in pieces, and so suffered her loue to receiue the same foile: besides (as it were insorcered, with her mothers deuillish Impostures) shee was the lesse carefull of her duety, &amp; therfore dared to reason with Encelidon to the same purpose; yea some-times to Xantippus instead of Encelidon: For but by their names she neuer could know one frō an other, who seemed to diuert her from such immanitie enforcing some arguments, though to little purpose, whereby if the feare had continued, hee might indeed haue suspected his friend, but the worst part of such a conceit was quickly cut off by the hasty (and peraduenture vnlook't for) comming of Encelidon; who once againe prostrated his open breast to Xantippus, and bade him not spare to rid the world of such a recreant traytor, whose wauering loialtie was subiect to so many temptations; with that hee went on in the strange discourse of his murther concluded by his wife and her mother; which with many protestations he disclaimed, and proceeded so farre, that after Xantippus had denyed to entertaine the least thought of suspition against him, he stabbed himselfe in many places, till preuented from the full effect

of his furie, Xantippus was enforced to a new course; at last his helpe brought recouery and encouragement seemed a reconciliation to the eternall strengthening the bond of friendship. But Eucasta all impatient at Encelidons slacknes, and more then perswaded, how Xantippus was made acquainted with the fault, presently fledde to Mastricot, wher after a pithy intimation of her disgraces, &amp; the wrongs offered her fathers honse (to which her mother added forceable reasons) shee raised a strong partie, and determined to repaire by force of Armes, what her slender policie (as she tearmed it) had almost ruined: so that Xantippus was compelled to stand on his gaurd, and (when he perceiued, how he which only lyeth at defence helpeth himselfe but a little withdefence) after to make an offensiue war. To this Encelidon, and the house of Soltimos was auxiliary, and the two friends gloried in their constancie, and cared not who stomaked the successe of their businesse: till at last the many slaughters and distractions of the Prouinces pleaded for redresse; and king Zalby was cornpelled in person to come into Comagena, to limit or restraine these mischiefes: yet wrought his presence no other attonement, but the surceance of the warre. For Eucasta (or Iugeroth in her daughters behalfe) would not hearken after any reconciliation; and Xantippus denied to be diuided from Encelidon, because Encelidon concluded neuer to be seperated from Xantippus.
                  
                  
                     
THis was the occasion of king Zalbys comming King Zalby commeth to Duke Rugio to Fortona. to Fortona, at such time as Egerius related the Historie of Mengrelius, whereupon they all dissisted from the worke in hand to attend the Duke who made it a matter of respect and specialitie to remember the Kings worth, as being his Vncle in blood, and father for directions and corroboration in his estate; whereupon the Officers of his Houshold omitted nothing, which belonged to the state of his person, &amp; the dignity of the present Court. Thus is King Zalby feasted, and much satisfied to be so magnificently feasted: thus is the Duke established in the strengthening amitie of such a mightie Prince: thus is Deltona cheered, that no action of Rugios ouer-passed the limmits of moderation: But thus is Montanus perplexed, as confounding desire &amp; distrust together: at last the Duke imparted to the King all the circumstances of his loue &amp; Rape; of Deltonas demeanor &amp; contempt; of Egerius complaint &amp; discourse; which the King (because he had bin long fince cursorily made acquainted with Kaluckies banishment, &amp; Mengrelius 
                     aduancement) desired to heare at large: Like a man tasting on delicates, who more longeth to fill his stomach after the proofe of the sweetnes, then before: whereupon the Duke soon conferred with his sonne Philano conceruing the matter, who as soone certified Egerius of the Kings pleasure, who as soone confented to obey the pleasure, and dispatch the matter, wherein he thus proceeded.
                  
                     
THe great Eye of heauen (most mighty Princes) 
                     Engerius prosceutcth the Historie of Mengrelius. had not fully viewed all the parts of the earth, nor time chased with such swiftnesse the course of the yeere: but that the fruitfull Arcabella once againe gaue notice of her pregnancie, and signified to the world, she was borne to be a mother, what Disaster soeuer went about to disappoint her: which only hasted the Emperors iourney forward; who setting on worke all the parts of his thoughts made a hundred seuerall fashions of one piece. Sometimes with more quicknesse then good speed, running ouer all the course of former occurrents, with a certaine heart-breaking at his Brothers exile; but surfetting on that dish, hee loathed the dyet, and choaked himselfe with the delight of principalitie; next hee remembred the contract, whereof the very terrour made him abashed to thinke, in what madnesse it was ratified then, and with what remorce repented now: anon hee conceited how his subiects were affected, if either the murther of his children should continue, or the breach of such inhumane couenants be attempted; afterward hee reasoned, why Arcabella importuned this trauell; and last of all, whether the sentence should be reputed Canonicall: Butthe feare of that diffidence extinguished at the first puffe the flame, and yet gaue light to goe forward in the other path; as if there were as much necessitie to propitiate Apollos displeasure, as to determine his owne

affaires: whereupon hee sent out Commissions, for the artificiall housing the Sea; and defensiue furnishing and rigging his Nauy; in which the benefit of a Sun-shining morning (nothing then practised but honourable necessitie) without further delay embarked him, and time (not much intermingled with strange occurrents) brought him at last to safe harbour.
                  Thus prooued this Voyage prosperous at Sea, and was not altogeather ominous at Land, because Scalitorax King of Phocis truly aduertised of the Emperours comming, and the cause, found it a matter of small suspition, and therefore made an honourable Welcome, a forward Spring of his owne greatnesse, and a very life of Mengrelius hope: But when his brother Misocrapus and Apollos Priest had returned answere, hee would attend the Emperour at Delphos, not doubting of auspicious successe, hee seemed rauished with gladnesse; and in that poynt of extremitie onely affoorded occasion of suspition, as when we see a sodaine Storme immediatly succeed a glorious Heate: yet durst no man make such interpretation, because the Art of Deuining was peculiar to the Priestes. So the Emperour went forwatd, and had Scalitorax company to the Towne; where he found the reuerent Misocrapus ready for his conduct to the Oracle.
                  
                     
THis Delphos had the report of others illustred, and the rarenesse of it selfe made admirable: The description of Delphos. in respect the place was supported by the euerflorishing Pernassus, which seemed glad to be the foundation of the Building; but ten times glad, that it resembled some Bulwarke to secure a tresurie; and yet it appeared more beholding to Nature then Art: For the cragginsse of the Hill resembled a very net of Rockes, as if the Stone and Earth were layde countercompony togeather: next the passable wayes were so many, and hemmed to crosse turnings meeting one another, that it made a confused Laborinth. Lastly, the entries into mighty Caues, represented so many Dores of the house of Darknesse; and by the many changes of Lightnings, Thunders, casting vp of Stones, Sulphur, flashings, filthy stenches, and suffocating Dampes, seemed the very entries of Hell; which Xerxes made proofe of by loosing foure thousand men in going about ro robbe the Treasure, and Brennus Duke of Gallia experimented, when hee prosecuted the like theft: Contrariwise, all peaceworking gentlenesse, and sence-pleasing sweetnes welcommed the necessarie commers, and liberall Benefactors.
                  On the topp of this Mountaine was the Oracle erected; a place beautified with the cost of Kings, &amp; venerated by the accesse of chiefest Monarches: for therein none might enter, but especiall Priests, religious Princes, and strange Embassadours.

Concerning the Monument it selfe, Fame confirmed it a Temple vnmatchable; and Time designed it the Pallace of Apollo, allowed both for an honorable dwelling, and a consecrated Sanctuarie: the substaunce whereof it was compounded, made shew of a costly Marble, and the forme it retayned, seemed a spatious Goodlinesse, staying the eyes of the beholders with varietie of obiect; wherein the Workemen had so played their partes, as if indeed they had determined to make their memories immortall. For Agamedes and Trophonius the supposed Attificers, are for this cause made famous: It was well Leaded on the top, strongly bard with Iron, vnusually windowed with Iaspar, mightily vnderpropt with Pillars, substancially roofed with Cedar, surely lockt to keepe their Treasure, and cunningly enclosed for obscuring their Secrets: the inside allowing more daintinesse, then the outside goodlinesse; and both vnited to be a scence-rauishing Miracle: and the trouble to others arose from conceite, rather how it was finished, then in the labour to them, which concluded it. Round about were Trees planted, in which did alwaies Oyle burne; Houses established to lodge the companie, and Vestries appoynted for the ornaments of the Sacrifice. At the Doore stoode an Idoll, which they did kisse: a hollow Truncke, in which they did offer, and a Lauatorie to wash in. Within hunge a siluer Bell to be rung, stoode a perfumed

Lampe to be sti

                     d, and a golden Altar supporting a massie Image, before whom they must kneele.
                  The Priestes were the first which apparrelled themselues, opened the doores, sweetned the roomes, bedecked the Tables, brought out the Rellicks, hung the walles, furnished the pillars, spread abroad costly Carpets, set out their Iewels, trimmed the cup-boards, and entertained the Embassadors. After them other Officers and Attendants were to celebrate a tryumph; and last of all, the parties approached to receiue their answeres, which were sometimes diffused &amp; obscure; sometimes ambiguous or Amphibologies; sometime briefe and very peremptorie; sometime true, certaine, and enlarged.
                  Now is the Emperor magnificently entreated, and orderly instructed; whereupon hee lodgeth his Retinew, watcheth his Nights, shaueth his haire, apparrelleth his body, approacheth the Temple, washeth his hands, offereth his presents, kisseth the Idole, knolleth the Bell, sturreth the Incense, alloweth the Orizons, beginneth his Sacrifice, standeth his Circles, and marketh the coniuration; which began with terrors and darknesse, vntill two burning Tapers suddenly flaming by the naked side of the Image, discouered the wonders of the Chappell, and made him attentiue to heare the vnliuing massinesse divuldge the pleasure of the Gods. This finished, the reuerent Misocrapus (in his Priestly habite) drew the stately

trauers before the Altar, and with a sadde demeanour presented himselfe to Mengrelius more sadder, kneeling vpon the ground, til the holy Priest fastned an enameled Tablet, to a twisted string of blacke silke and gold, putting it ouer his head next his bodie, and departed awhile with a silent blessing, leauing the Emperor to the dispatch of the Ceremonie, but the Attendants of the Pallace, brought Mengrelius solemly foorth to his companie, who as solemly welcommed him, and so they tooke leaue of Misocrapus, &amp; returned to the Citie of Delphos, where Scalitorax King of Phocis expected his aduenture.
                  By this time either feare or furie hastned his departure to his ships, wherein he quickly disposed himselfe, and without other interception, then the tediousnesse of the iourney, came in safetie to Trebizonda, where each one imparted the manner of the Voyage, and made this diuision of their discourses; some amplified the description of the places seene; others the discouery of the wonders heard: some tooke occasion from those changes the Sea afforded; others made remonstrance of what each countrey maintained: some ouer-passing what was impertinent, disputed of the hill, and the Oracle; others more curious intermedled with the Sacrifice and the Orders, which not admitted to behold, they were therefore more desirous to vnderstand: some presumed to aske how the Emperor was pleased, and others dared to enquire,

whether the Common-wealth should be disordered: but the fearefull Mengrelius made his accesse to the Court, an astonishment to his Nobles, and a heauie welcome to Arcabella; they sorrowing his answere was frownes: and she trembling his salutation was a command out of presence, who accustomed to no other disposition then obedience: displeasingly dutifull accorded to the hard doome, and louingly impatient effected his will.
                  But vnkindnesse had not thus her period: For Mengrelius findnig the Oracle to threaten his destruction, in the Beleefe grewe so impatient, that the promises of comfort, and sweetnesse of counsell seemed ircksome, scarse abiding to heare of redresse, and absolutely denying to discouer the reason: resembling him, whom crueltie bereaued of his principall member the tongue, because hee had nothing to talke of but wofull lookes, nor any thing to discouer, but soone mooued displeasure, which astonished the beholders, who yet desisted not to pacifie his trouble, and beguile his passion: but he despighted to see any inclination to delight, and perceiuing his actions were so generally marked, retiered himselfe, and was only humorons in the worst part of melancholy: at last the extremitie draue him cleane out of doores, and made him eccho in the fields, what he durst not wisper in the Pallace.
                  O Gods (quoth hee) what auaileth life, if to liue be worse then death? What profiteth honour

What preeminence in the title of dignitie; when confusion shall make ridiculous dignitie, titles, and preeminence? O Fortune! O false Fortune! Well may we call thee blind, when thou strikest those who offered no wrong; and fawnest on him, that detesteth thy fauours. Well may we call thee vnconstant; for if by chaunce a Morning manifest thy smiles, yet shall the same Euening detect thy malice.

For the heauens haue conspired, the earth consented, and hell it selfe concluded my destruction.

terror intrudeth with suspition: But witlesse &amp; impatient: whether am I carried with these outrages; either there is truth or falshood: if the first, what preuention? if the latter, why was any iorney? yet shall I be so childish to shrinke vnder this feare; as though each paltry ceremony were the armes of Religion, or coosening deuice of Priestes a countermaunding of the actions of Kings? tush; I will not submit to such mockery, nor suffer my selfe to be the stall of derision. No, no; before I consent to be so sottishly baffled: Murder, Fury, &amp; Contempt of all Women shall reuenge my distemprature.
                  In this mood he hasted toward the Pallace, but the instant violence of his Resolution was thus stangely rebated: Eare the tract of the groue had fully conduced him to the end, a sodden storme intercepted further hastinesse, and compelled his retreat to a place of shellter: now; whether the nature of the tempest effectuated drowsinesse; or his spirites weried with meditation desired rest: or the very braine dryed with sorrow shruncke vp the stringes of his eyeliddes; or him selfe was willing to this course to ouerpasse his feare; he quietly fell a sleepe, had not his sleepe the more disquieted him, like a man reparing a ruinous house, and pulling downe aparte haleth also the whole to his greater charge: For a formidable dreame thus surprised his repose. An Eagle mounting to her Mengrelius troubled with a Dreame. nest had onely too young ones to feed, but whether she conceiued vnkindnesse against them or in

the misfortune of her rauin brought not wherewithall to succour them; or displeased at some other accident, shee threwe them to the ground, leauing, her selfe childlesse, and them liuelesse: yet they recouered, and miraculously gathering new life, and extraordinary stature returned, ere their mother had made a second flight; seeming by their demeanour as though they come to comfort her: but shee stomacking the curtesie, conuerted her loue to rage, and began a manner of contention against them; they seeing the daunger desisted awhile, till very necessitie of life draue them to offence; and offence increasing with anger, anger forgat it selfe, and so betweene them the olde one was torne in pieces, which when a better consideration deliberated on, with a monstrous howling they departed: the noyse whereof awaked Mengrelius, so his Dreame ended, and the tempest ended, but a worse dismay began then before.
                  At last remembring himselfe, he hasted to a priuate Posterne of the pallace, where finding the appointed Comptrollor of his house, hee with him imparted such secrets, that as the charge was of importance, his dispatch was with speedinesse. For he presently returned with sadnesse from the Empresse, and trouble from the Court; shee submitting to his appointment, and they appointing that nights libertie, if it pleased him to visite her; where upon he hasted vp, and dismissing all from his presence, conferred onely with his mother about

strange things and tolde his sister Pisana his cruell resolution; wherein the suspition was so terrible, that forgetting the weakenesse of his Empresse, hee left them and thus astonished the helpwanting Princesse: with a soule-vexing preamble: Vnfortunate Arcabella, not in that thou art the daughter of Samarchanus, but wife of Mengrelius: vnderstand by me; that I am accursed for my owne sake, and thou art cast with the same verdict for my sake, as being the instrumentall cause of vnhappinesse: the Oracle confirming thee a mother of strange Issue, pronouncing my deiection by my sonne, death by my daughters husband, and confusion, if I infringe the oth to Kalucki; nor imagine I am caried away with supposes. For what I haue rufully reported, thou mayest pittifully ouer-looke, with that he shewed them Misocrapus Tablet, and they read the Prophesie thus insculped.

                  This they read, and to this was some reply in redinesse, but Mengrelius interposed this breuitie; that my former Oath may therefore bee kept inuiolate, and my vexed spirits from sorer out-rage restained, I command (what euer vnreasonablenesse seeme in the command) that as soone as Nature hath brought thy children into the light, thy own hands depriue them of the light; this see thou regard to performe, and performe as thou regardest thy life; but Arcabella permitted not the freedom of this bitternesse, for she thus aduentured to repell it.
                  
                     What inhumane crueltie is heere threatned, and vnmanly prosecutions deuised; nothing but inordinate passions, distempered behauiour, broken sleeps, fearefull out-cries, inconsiderate vows, and vnnaturall tyranies? Neere tell mee of vnprincely protestations, better resolue to transgresse enforced contracts, which satisfaction may counteruaile; then continue in settled wickednesse which repentance cannot mitigate? better submit to inscrutable mercie, whose goodnesse euer exceedeth formidable appearance, then execute malicious

wilfulnesse, whose out-rages are seldome preuented? What Law, Iudgement, or Reason wil allow, condemne, disappoint? The massacre of innocent Babes; the Preuiledge of sacred Princes; the right of Legitimate Heires. But to the purpose; hath heauenly reuolution threatned an ouerthrow? What earthly meanes can prohibite the pleasure of the Gods; hath our feare taken roote from the Oracle of Apollo? What humane cunning shall hinder the course of their springing? Yet peraduenture you haue mistaken: what was prophesied, or prophesied what your selfe haue mistaken: besides each fond Dreame must not be beleeued, or lying Priest allowed; as for deuine resolutions, neither can the reaching wit of man impeach the credite, nor Furie of deuils controule the enforcement. By the paines therefore of Ballutasa in our birth I desire; by the teares &amp; sadnes of Pisana: by my owne chastitie; by thy aduancement to this Empire; by the secrets of our marriage I coniure; either your patience to tollerate the burden of heauenly Imposition, or resuscitate your allacritie to recouer your renowne: by the one you shall be sure to proceed in a good course; by the other confirme the faith of your subiects toward you; who setled so long in a happy peace, &amp; confirmed in the Loue of a Royall Prince, wil neither hazerd the one, nor leaue the other, though Kalucky should immagine there were cause of innouation.
                  
                  
                     ut what was this otherwise, then to spit against

the winde, whose violence returneth the filth into thy face, or to impart the sweetnesse of musick to a deafe auditorie. For hee either not hearing, because he minded it not; or not minding, because it liked not: or not liking, because it pleased not; or not pleasing, because it disagreed to his humorous suspition, answered; My will shall now stand for a Lawe, and pronounceth death to thy children; or losse of thy owne life; with which conclusion of death departing, as the beginning was death, the proceeding death, and the ende death, so no doubt had it finished with a double death, if prouident carefulnesse had not preuented desperate quicknesse. For the Empresse all inraged, put in practise diuers motions of a broken spirit; as rashing of her ornaments of Maiestie; scratching her louely face with a manifest rebellion against beautie, disseuering her daintie plighted tresses in scorn of comelinesse, and bethumping her panting sides swelling with the life striuing within; so that the Ladyes had a taxe of difficultie imposed to withhold her from a desperate crueltie, til a new worke proposed it selfe: for her spirites weakened with the threanes of her pangs; and her pangs increasing with child-bearing trauell, subiected her to necessitie of life, and induced them to further her deliuerance, which was done in such reuerent manner, and womanly order, that the secret was secret to themselues, and the hurliburly consisted in the action, which busied, and not in the parly, which troubled them.
                  
                     
THus may the next Morning send fame abroad The Empresse is deliuered of two children, the one named Trezoboro, the woman Brizaca. to declare the hazard of Arcabella her selfe, and the birth of two Princes; who though they seemed marked for the court of life, yet durst they not but appoint them to the house of death; allowing onely this fauour, to name them before they went that their entertainment might bee like Empresse children; so the man was called Trezoboro, and the woman Brizaca, and thus began their Tragedie.
                  No sooner had the carefull Ballutasa clogged the mothers armes with so precious a burden, but shee affoorded them ghastly lookes and sore outcries, the children smiling but newe borne, and laughing the faster for her threatning the greater; which had shee warily marked (though the dangerous choise caused the preferment of her owne life, whereby shee demaunded the instrument of of death) yet surely would the heart neuer haue consented to so pittilesse an action, nor the tongue so quickly expressed the consent of the heart. For in dimnesse of sight (teares still hindring the fulnes of seeing) beholding how pleasure and delight made reziance in their countenance, shee forgate either to doe or to speake; and proceeding further, burst foorth into abrupt speeches, threatning to kil her selfe with them. But the mother fore-seeing the inconueniences of a troubled spirit, by policie wrested the knife from her handes, and by force

tooke the children out of her armes, imploying another in that butcherly office, who had charge to hast with diligence, and dispatch with secrecie.
                  The Ladie daring not denie, what yet she durst not complish, had libertie (teares and kneeling procuring this libertie) to depart out of sight, and so retired her selfe into some obscure corner; mistrusting the light would haue made her ashamed to murther infanrs: but heere a conscience not to dee amisse, ouer wrought with a sudden timerousnesse, that the heart repented, and the hands could not: Then she tryed a place where shee might see what she did; but now their smiles caused so many teares that shee was neither able to abide them laughing, or her owne selfe trembling: Once againe she posted to the corner of a Groue, but here a sudden quaking turned the sharpned edge to her owne heart, as shee profered her hand to their throat: At last remembring the penaltie, shee concluded her owne life dearer then all the Princes in the world; so that growing halfe angry, she tooke againe the knife, and more stoutly went forward; yet proffering a stroake roared out-right, fainting for feare, and fearing euer after so to presume: thus as she went shee returned, prostrating her selfe both before the mother and the mothers mother, desiring to abide a thousand torments, rather then imagine a thought amisse against them; so that a new course of immolation must be taken in hand, or some strange deuise of concealement put in practise;

whereupon they reasoned among themselues on the fame of the action, the charitie of the deed, and the honour of the attempt: nor left they out the difficultie of the enterprise, the penaltie of infringing the Emperors pleasure, the way to preuent the greatest mischiefe, which was the accesse to see them murdered, nor the recompence, which time might recouer, if the Princes should be preserued: so that Ballutasa made Arcabella strengthen her selfe with the returned spectacle, taught Arcabella meanes to bee patient; and patience in her anguish, told Arcabella, Trezoboro and Brizaca should liue, and reioyced with Arcabella, for that Gellida and Perinthum vndertooke the matter.
                  THese were two daughters of the King of Capadocia 
                     How Gellida and Perinthum saued the Princes.

                      of his passage. Now by reason hee was cotributotie to the Empire, and had setled his brother Cicotroxus in the great Office of Dianas Priest-hood in Taurica, these Ladies from their Vncles priuiledge wrought the Idea of the childrens securitie, and presently posted to Cicotroxus, to whom they discouered the whole processe, the penaltie of the Law, the cruell determination of the Emperour,

and the shortnesse of time, as being limited but fourteene dayes of returne: When the reuerent 
                        Arch-Priest, heard the discourse, rather conceiuing well on the piety of his Neeces with their Honorable pollycie, then disputing on feares or troubles depending, like a man prising integritie before worldly respect, He confirmed the action, and thus briefly warranted likelyhood of successe: Although (Royall Ladyes) as a man subiect to the weaknesse of our first

                         matters of greater secret, though not of such consequence, I desist from vnnecessary questions, and thus giue light to your furtherance. Dianas sacrifices are euery Moone cellebrated the first day; and consist of humane bloud from the Veines of young infants, wherwith we besprinckle the altares and then consume the bodies with fier, other ceremonies are infinite, and easier to be knowne by eye witnesse then report, now by vertue of my authority will I proclame the necessitie of a new supply, out of which you shall choose a cupple a Male and Female, and with them depart to Trebizond, presenting the Empres this signe of my affection, and duty. For if Mengrelius importune the murder, which he will quickly doe, then may these tollerate the cruelty, and you with the true Princes escape to Capadocia, if this please; detract no time?

but returne in peace: if not; to morrow is the day of pacification, and you shall vnderstand the pleasure of the Goddesse:
                  
                  But the Ladies quickly apprehended Cicotroxus deuice and thought it bootelesse to make further tryall, therefore gratifying their Vncle they returned to the Empresse, as you see the friend of a faultie subiect to some great Prince; who either condemneth to death or bannishment: for shee remained all this while in discomforts and doubtes, because whatsoeuer chanced, she must be depriued of her Children; but by that time Gellida and Perinthum had pacified with reason, and enforced argument of two inconueniences, to beare the lesser burden, she cheared herselfe, and somewhat raysing her body with a heart enforcing fearefullnesse, and teares compounded of sorrow and gladnesse deliuered her Twinnes to the Ladyes; who receiued them with a modest stilnesse and departed accordingly, leauing the strangers like silly lambes in a Butchery:
                  No sooner were they thus dismissed, but the Emperor (infringing the particulars of his owne state) would needs visit Arcabella, and in person behold the execution: For thus it chanced: since the time of his suspition and fearefull Dreame, he was much conuersant with Belgorundo a magitian now counted in Court, but till this necessity neuer esteemed, nor reputed worthy such a title, had not fortune beene the Maister, and meere

happ the Minister of his renowne, because Mengrelius first acquainted him with the couenantes betweene Kalucki &amp; himselfe, &amp; after with the vision of the Eagles, which he enterpreted by himselfe and his Children, wherin he so iumped with the Emperors ielosie, and indeed seconded the Prophesie of the Oracle, (which was not as yet discouered to any body,) that he seemed to dote on his skill, and graced him with a Roabe of Purple, a Cape of Maintenance, and winged rod like Mercuries Caduceus: withall he commaunded the Court to honour him for his respect, so that his reputation accrewed from Mengrelius, will and he made his owne power the meanes to continue it; which he might the better do, because the birth of the Princes chanced as was before intimated; besides Belgorundo (vnderhand acquainted with the Empres vnwillingnesse to the murder, and flat deniall to be the executioner) he reuealed it to the Emperor, and wrought a further ampliation of his credite, by inferring the new discoueries, concerning his brother, and the warres likly to ensue, if the couenants betweene them weare infringed: Wherupon the Emperor seemed in a manner distracted conceiuing it would be so, and fearing it should be so, as if indeed it weare so, and with the misdoubt of he knew not what, rather raging then distempred hasted to Arcabella, threatning nothing but fier and sword, if they once immagined to deceiue him: they againe exclaimed, as farre as they

durst, &amp; dared to execrate all incantations and deluding sorceries: but neither exclamations nor execrations, nor the sweete infants themselues mollefied the hard harted Emperor. For he beheld the Massacre in person, leauing them to what pacification, they could procure; and returned himsealfe to see, who durst find faulte:
                  By this time are Gellida and Perinthum welcomed into Cappadocia, as gratious to Opacus their father, and gratified by the subiects of the kingdome: yet concealing the secrets of their iorney they watched an opportunitie thus to dispose of the Princes, Coranus &amp; Bertosus too brothers dwelling togeather in one house, and hauing maried Dalie and Phemon, too sisters not altogeather of Ignoble parents assured the world, that loue and good order can affright Enuy and Contention: For whether their delight one in another conuicted those displeasures, which passe betweene man and man, nothing was offensiue, or if it were the offence neuer appeared, or whether the time affoorded no scope to the ambition of men, or peeuishnesse amongst women, the husbandes carefully endeuored to looke to their businesse, the wiues modestly agreed to content their husbandes, and both like a The Empres Children deliuered to Coranus and Bertosus, too Brothers in Capadocia: well made bundell of sweete smelling flowers, yeelded comfort to the sence and life: To these (most mighty King and Duke) weare these Princes deliuered, and these (pointing to Coranus and Bertosus indeed) be the men accountable for this reckning;

so that if their Fortune be worth the discouering from their Infancie forward, no doubt by their discourses the trueth will in more liuely collours appeare.
                  NOw by the plentious times of Katabasies 
                     Montanus hearing the Historie of Mengrelius is much troubled when the Duke confesseth that he loueth Delte na victories (quoth King Zalby) I am much satisfied in the redaction of this Chaos, because till now Fame hath beene to sparing of her secrets, and the report of the Trebizondian turmoiles was either denied the trueth, or augmented according to the disposition of the author. For we knew that Mengrelius possessed the Diadem, and Kalucki meant to be beholding to his owne valour for another kingdome: whereunto (as if an heroicall presumption had been the breath of some heauenly voyce) Fortune quickly lifted him vp, and gaue him the further Tartarie in reward of his paines, which first made him passage through my vpper Comagena, and after wrought his acceptation with the magnanimous Mullumalla the widow, Empresse of the late deceased Barka: so that by your fauour (Nephew Rugio) I wil gratulate Egerius for the participating this Noueltie; and entreat Coranus and Bertosus (seeing we are so forward on our iourney) not to leaue vs, till we come to safe harbout. All this and more (answered the Duke) shal be but part of my dutie, yet doth the eyes of feare fore-see, that the end will be worse then the beginning;

and both beginning and ende vnite a crosnesse against me. For Egerius himselfe is displeased, Bertosus dreadfull, and Coranus mistrusteth my loue to Deltoua.
                  
                  
                     But when Montanus heard the name of loue, so sadly pronounced, and the name of Deltona, and the name of anothers lou

                      by policie to escape) he started vp, and somewhat angerly (for his associate furie was moderated), spake to this purpose. Great Princes, as you expect dutie and alleageance from your subiects, so must you be the author's of iustice and vertue in yourselues; els may you be feared for tyrants, and hated for beeing feared; els may you incurte the danger of repining, which at aduantage is subiect to innouation, &amp; wil questionless a subborne euery traiterous reuolt; els may yee awake a sleeping enemie, as sometimes the priuare occasions of one Kingdome maketh partes-taking from another. Let Honour then ouer-looke his Index for particular directions, and you maintaine goodnesse for the enlargement of renowne: as for the matter in hand, a compulsiue loue is absolute incontinencie, and the disseising of anothers right is worse then tyrannie, especially in a matter of such consequence as the disturbing the beautious Deltona, whom some heauenly influence hath warranted that I

and must enioy: assure you then no deuice, or force of man shall bereaue me of my claime, considering my interrest.
                  
                  
                     Looke how some strange apparition doeth set on worke the eyes of such as are mooued with nouelties; so did the suddennesse of Montanus speech amaze the hearers: for the King maruailed, Rugio stomached, Egerius gazed, Coranus with Bertosus trembled, &amp; all were silent; vntill the Duke grudging at the reprehension, durst not giue way (as he supposed) to such audaciousnesse, but thought to slake the violence in this manner. Boldly spoken what ere thou art, yet ouer-caryed With presumption (which many times ouer-throweth a good purpose, by taking a wrong course to suppresse a badde) thou abusest a Prince, and hast waded further then strength is able to deliuer, or policie to refraine: besines it is not for Shepheards and men of base estates, to entermeddle with the actions of persons priuiledged, and sacred: But to permit a straggling vp-start thus afore my owne subiects, the King in presence, in my Court, and to my face, to distaine my honour, which neuer was impeached? I may not, I will not, I cannot abide it, though my pleasure maintained a fault indeed.
                  
                  
                     A fault (replyed Montanus) by Marpefias Altar such a fault, that vnlesse you determine otherwise, then to affright the peerelesse Deltona; it is not menaces, or titular dignities, shall keepe reuenge from sending her ministers amongst you;

or make me subiect (against vertue) to imperious will.
                  The King Zalby was much mooued at this, but Rugio more; as suspecting a purposed neglect of dutie: yet perceiuing a setled countenance, and vndeuided speeches to conclude the rebuke, they knew not how to enterpret it; considering the partie reputed an inferiour amongst them; at last they called Coranus, who more fearefull to oppose against the Duke, then firme in expectation of Montanus, told them of his shipwracke at Sea; Placandus entertainement; his loue to Deltona, the Contract at the Caue, and in a sparing manner, how he promised her to discouer a further secret: which wrought thus much, that the King fore-saw there might be cause of affliction; and he seemed likely to be of better account, by which reason the Duke was pacified, and Montanus moderated his forwardnesse: but who had seene Egerius behold him in this extasie pleading for Deltona, would haue sworne he had beene contemplating some Prodegie: presently Philano aduaunced himselfe, and asking Egerius what troubled him, bade him withall tell his opinion of Montanus. Truely (sayd Egerius) accidents of admiration chance in the world, and men are subiect to high direction, so that it must needs fall out, that hee hath beene ouer-burdened with extremitie, and is sure of better desert then the outward habite or appearance, which hee the rather allowed, because by his owne example

hee might immagine as vnlikely possibilities to come to passe. VVell sayd Philano, ere wee haue done, I beleeue, wee shall haue much to doe; for as yet we are in the midst of a confusion, and ignorance tryumphes she hath, and must make vs astonished. But the Duke (loth that a time of mirth and entertainment should bee out-faced with trouble and dismay) dismissed them awhile, euery man to his owne course, and imployed himselfe to honor the King with entertainment befitting; whereuppon a solemne hunting inuited him to varietie of pastime, and no man was wanting, whom place or pleasure induced to attend: and as you see a cunning enemie obscure himselfe in some remote place of aduauntage, when hee apprehendeth a stronger force is comming against him: So played the Inhabitants of these woods, after they vnderstood now they were besieged; till suspecting the ill successe of a tryall, they tooke aduantage to escape, little thinking that their steppes betrayed them, and gaue notice to the aduersarie of their beeing; who by this time discrying their flight, shooted for ioy, as if already victory had administred both renowne and reward: in the end, least delay might breed disaduantage, the Houndes (with the addition of their Masters policie in laying of Toiles, and orderly following the execution▪ quickly ouer-tooke them in the Retreat, and them subiected to a furious slaughter. But the Officers loth to make too tyrannous a spoyle,

sounded the rechaite, so the rest at randome were assured of more rest; yet rested not the Duke, till he conducted the King in to a gallant Arbour, so cunningly handled, that a man might haue said the deuiser determined to grace the walkes of the Pallace with a worke of specialtie, and set foorth his owne praises, as if he were by it to commend himselfe; for who could but aske his name to know him, and extoll him once knowne.
                  Heere was a roiall Banquet prepared, and an after time of Counsell (sorting with the conueniencie of the place) concluded, that Bertosus should end the Storie of Mengrelius; who as willing to be disburdened of hir owne feares, as they seemed to be acquainted with others fortune, sent for Montanus to come within hearing, and thus began.
                  AFter Gellida and Perinthum had taken notice Bertofus proceedeth in the story of Mengrelius. of our solitary life, knowing we retyred our selues in the fulnesse of a good opinion, least the deceiuing vanities of the world might endanger or entrappe vs, they committed the Infants vnto our charge; not without some circumstances of the perill in the discouerie, the feare of both the Empresses, the troubles depending, and their owne reuerent care toward them, as if the hope of many Kingdomes lay heauy either vppon our diligence or negligence. Thus were wee much esteemed for the resort of the Kings daughters

vnto vs, who indeede often visited, and as often rewarded vs; so that wee had cause to bee carefull, as well for their sakes that commanded, as theirs wee had in custodte: this wee performed with reasonable successe. For the time of Nursing ouer-passed, the Princes seemed to scorne their Infancie by entertaining a third year, to which they posted with such a gallantnesse, as if indeede they had knowne with iudgement to haue welcommed all gallantnesse. But (most Noble King and Duke) looke how a suddaine storme is so much the more terrible to a well burdened Barke, by how much it is in iollitie of a good beginning, and almost in sight of safe harbour; so was the pride of our hopes rebuked; and when wee least suspected alteration in such a kinde, there happened a most vnkinde alteration. For as my brother and I solaced the Princes in the walkes of a pretty Groue, whereon the handy-worke of man had bestowed addition, and stood playing the wantons with conceit of their towardlinesse, who by this time seemed the Heauens charge, as well as our charge; comes the Arch-pirate Cleonidas, and altering the manner (though not the profession) hurried vs together toward the Hauen, where his ships lay at Anchor.
                  With that Montanus in suddaine motion interrupted his speech, &amp; hearing the name of Cleonidas pronounced, cried out: O Eternall Powers!

                        
hath Cleonidas been an Actor in this Tragedie, and do I liue to heare so odious a sound to my sences? Or shall I liue to thanke the gracious Nemesis for his destruction? Or may I liue to reuenge my disgraces: if the Ocean haue scorned to bee poisoned with his carkas? O Princes! pardon my impatience: this is the head from whence my affliction springs, and runneth into a strong channell of disquiet this is the roote supporting a stocke of miserie, and spreadeth into branches of all vnhappinesse to shade my happinesse: this is the author of such immanitie, as my tongue trembleth to report it; though he seemed raised from the deepest hell to put it in practise. As he was setting forward this inuection, King Zalby perceiuing hee had awaked some conceit of importance, rose vp with a milde intent of pacification (least in counterchecking the humour, it might either grow to violence, or exasperate his discontent) and thus perswaded him: Princely Montanus, We are not so incredulous of those infinite accidentes, which are directed by highest influence, as to oppose against your desert; but lay the fault of our slight respect vpon ignorance, and permit Bertosus to goe forward: then by a Kings protestations, I sweare, your desires shall not range to such a scope, but wee will bring them within limitation; and if neede requireth, with a royall consent alsist your desires. By this time had discretion wonne the field, and Montanus seemed halfe ashamed, yet loth to make any

                        
demisse appearance, hee thus replyed: Vertue (great King) I see will be like a square Die, euery way cast standing vpright: your wisedome hath ouer-ballanced my distemperature, and in a manner recouered my despaire, I will therefore fasten my anchor on the holde of your honourable promises, and attend more chearefully the discourse: with that he sate downe, and Bertosus proceeded.
                  
                     Cleonidas hauing ranged farre from his shippes, ouer-tooke vs thus accompanied, and as wee thought to rudely, questioned our names, estates, The Empres children with Coranus and Bertosus taken prisoners by Cleonidas. and dwelling; wee supposing the reuerence of our King would haue made our peace, and the respect to the Princely Infants assured our libertie, boldly made answer, whatsoeuer you be, or intend; We are the Kings seruants, and these be the Kings children, and you and these (quoth one amongst the rest) be now prisoners to Cleonidas, and so shall remaine, til the tyrannous Perinthum redeeme them with the price of her honour; by this time wee vnderstood enough, and more then was pleasing (vnlesse you may immagine an offender standing before a seuere Judge, vrging his fault to as cruell a Iurie, and after their verdict giuing sentence of death, pleased with the same) For Cleonidas we knew, and his despight wee knew, and the cause of Cleonidas despight we knew flowed from the current of this venemous streame.
                  
                     
                     ARtabazes was no sooner inuested with the roialties of Armenia, but Cleonidas taking The story of

                        xus and Menedemus. his banishment in disgrace exprobrated his simplicitie, that had not more iudicially proceeded wherupon (as hee supposed, to recouer his credit, rather then for any mallice to the King) he attempted a second innouation, but herein his will exceeded his fortune: for the valliant Pelorus Artabazes Admirall, ere he once set foot on land discomfited him at sea; and enforced his reculing to the dry Iland: where Cleonidas tooke a newe course of life both by Piracie, whereby hee gathered infinite wealth, and mercenary assisting other Princes, which obtained him many friends. In the time of this wantonnesse, on the borders of Capadocia was resident as Prouincial Gouernor Prazus, a Gent, of an ancient house and great estate, had not the crueltie of the warres wasted the same; but now somewhat resetled by his owne endeauours and policie, and in reasonable good grace with the king Opacus for his seruice; hee thought vpon nothing so much as the addition of Honour to his house: but apprehending a kinde of error in the kings wants, who was counted to exchang fauour for money, and vnwilling to giue him cause of distasting, considering that aduancements depend on the pleasure of the Prince; hee conferred with his friends about the king, and such whom seruice at Court had especially graced: so that perceiuing

                        
the vse of their fauour, he compared himselfe to a man ready for entrance in to some pleasant Gallery, wherof he had the right, but another keepeth the Key: at last reason, reward, or his owne worth preuailed with them, &amp; they inferred to the King the necessitie of the gouernment, the deseart of the Gent. not without addition, how hee had lost his Goodes, spent his Reuenewes, and hassarded his Life: thus was the King prepared. Then proceeded they further by putting him in memorie, how the Vertuous expect a Recompence, as well as the Wicked deserue Punishment: And lastly, as the string, which yeelded the sweete sound of the Musicke, they touched this, that a present summe of Mony and yearely Reuenewes, would come into the Treasurie. I will not say it preuayled; but the King most graciously ennobled him with the title of Exarchate, and constituted him Gouernour during life, according to the Lawes of the Land; wherevppon now the Lord Praxus was enforced to try Menedemus for a competent portion of money to defray his charges, that the entrance into his new Honour in good fashion might establish the opinion of the people by applauding his worth. This was a wretch liuing in the strength and delicatest place of all the Kingdome; and had culled out the sweetest dwellings, and peeces of Land to make his Inheritance sufficient, like a skilfull Marchant who determining to iourney into a strange Country, and contriuing

to returne with credite and gaine, searcheth euery Shoppe of a Citie, and selected the best Peeces, the curiostest Stuffe, the choysest Dellicats, and what els he needeth to serue his turne: Yet for all this was the threed of his life drawne from such a minde as seemed made of filth and durt, and the very dregges of Miserie: For abroad his complaints were of the ill thriuing of his Cattle, the vntoward groth of his Corne, the ill payment of the Tenants, the want of Money; when yet it was well knowne, hee had alwayes great summes lying by him; so that the bad vse of Natures blessings, made him want indeed; and that v

Tragedy: And if necessitie wrested the disbursing of some small summes, hee would excruciate him selfe; but when the State compelled his acc

                  With such a fellow was Praxus to deale withall, and had so many delayes, such excuses, such foreswearings, yea teares from his eyes flowing from an hipocriticall heart, that he knew nor whether to laugh, or to be angry: at last vpon sufficient securitie of a Morgage; a Lordship, on which hee had long since cast his eyes for his younger Sonne, like him that ouerlooketh a flocke of Sheepe to see which be ready for the Butcher, or to inrich his Purse; the Money was sent, and Menedemus tormented him selfe, not so much for feare of the securitie, as to depart from the company of his Treasure. Now betweene the time of repaiment,

                     Menedemus had brought to his house the beautious Lausana, a Ladyes daughter left in ward to the King, and by this Monster of Nature bought out, more to make benefite of, then for loue to his sonne, or any other, whom her owne worth without addition, might well satisfie. With her did L. Praxus fall in loue; and feeing the forwardnes of so many Graces in so gracious a person, assured him selfe, they could not chose but grow vp to the becomming of the place wherein they were sette, and bring all wealth, happinesse, and coutentment to him whose fortune had alotted the Haruest; but perceiuing the diff

                     culty of obtaining her, by reason of Menedemus bad disposition &amp; ielosie, and that he was aleady engaged, and within his danger, (as you haue heard) he knew not well how to proceed; at last he contriued not to pay his Mony, and by a little stretching his Authoritie, sent a band of Souldiers to keepe possession of the Place; all which, he said, was for the wretches good, because if he would consent to the Contract of Lausana, he might at one payment receiue the Mony borrowed, and what he had disbursed for her Wardship; otherwise he would inferre to the King and Counsell, the complaints against him, the mischiefes he had procured, and some other enforcements, which would ouerthrow him for euer. Heere was Menedemus in an extasie, hauing so many Crosses, (as hee tearmed them) to be cleared of as to be vtterly vndone for want of his Money,

to be vexed in soule with the feare of this accusation, and to be put to greater charge in contesting with the gouerner: but the secret of this terror depended on a priuate commaund from the king not to cellebrate Lausan as mariage without his consent; nor to yeeld to any contract to another vnlicensed from the state: This he tould Praxus with a strange kinde of trembling, that he hoped he would not seeke his ouer-throw, nor put him to trouble in recouering his owne: but Praxus by faire intreatie not to suspect displeasure, considering she should rather be aduanced then disparaged, wonne him to thinke well of the Maryage, and by engaging his Honour to see him secured or otherwise not damnefied, made some return of comfort, but indeed the absolute deniall of his Money, vnlesse he consented to this course, enforced him at last to forget dutie and honestie; and so with a chearfulnesse in the receipt thereof, hee deliuered Lausana to Praxus: for which, hee gratified the wretch beyonde expectation. Thus either returned; Menedemus to his miserable life, and Praxus to solemnise the Triumph of his delight: wherein without doubt (if hee had proceeded with the Kings fauour) a happie contentment had been the reward of counterchangeable worth, and liking.
                  By this time is Opacus acquainted with each circumstance, wherupon he sommoned both Praxus and Menedemus to appeare at Archelais, which

                     Praxus would haue done, had not the other for feare of expences absolutely denied it, and putting him in minde of his promises, and how for his sake these dangers were threatned, detracted the time so long, that Opacus stomaching the contempt proclaimed them both Traitors, their goods and Landes to be confiscate, &amp; their persons infamous and subiect to the Law: this newes had almost made cowardise the seruant of Valure. For Menedemus would haue kild himselfe, or rather hanged himselfe, least he should haue seene his one blood, had not Praxus awaked his drowsinesse with warrantice and comforte, that rather then for so slight offence extremity should open the gates of crueltie; Curatsax king of

his Boates on Camelles backes ouer the Mountaines, leauing his shippes sufficiently conducted and secured, with his ayde and the death of Menedemus, (who in a time of

                  But Perinthum assuered her father, that her faulcon pitched a higher flight, which he not much misliked, and therefore to auoyd all inconueniences sent her with Gellida, her other sister to attend the Empres of Trebizond, and enformed Cleonidas, as though their owne wilfulnesse, or desier to be acquainted with a place of such renowne had vndertaken the progresse: To this excuse he knew not how to oppose. For finding Opacus rather wishing a pacification of the displeasure, then countenancing the Vnkindnesse, he moderated his Indignation; and so departed, neither warranting his loue, nor expressing his hate to the Country: Till vnderstanding of the Ladies returne, hee practised many meanes to circomuent her; and fayling in them, as many forages to disquiet the Land, which some times with successe had outragious effectes; some times with stronge hand, as forcible repulses; till at last, Fortune willing to doe him a pleasure, as the Champion of

her quarrels, brought this prey to his choyse, and him to this place at such time, as wee were playing with the Princely Infants: so that the action related his pride in vnmannerly hastinesse hurrying vs away; and thanked Opportunitie, as it should seeme, without further questions in vnproper cruelty tying vs in bands: For all wee intreated with teares, threatned with anger; lamented with sighes, anon rayled on their presumption, after offred sufficient ransome; and last of all, pleaded conscience, manhood, and the Law of all Nations. The Infants in the meane while, smiling at the vproare, neither dismayed with the company as Strangers, nor action as troublesome: But neither intreaties, promises, prayers, offers, threatnings, nor exclamations, could preuaile: Forwith tedious Iornies they brought vs to the Sea side, where their Shippes lay at anchor, and were ready to attend the caulling of the Winde, who by this time, began to chide our negligence, that was not thankfull to so kind putting vs in minde of our businesse: onely wee expected the comming backe of the Captaine; whom Cleonidas had sent to certifie Opacus of the accident.
                  But when his returne assured an illusion, and that the king disclaimed any right to the infants, warranting withall the fiction, but a deuice to set our selues at libertie: neuer was so fit a time to pattern out wrath and fury, as in Cleonidas whose

But wee kept a steady passage to our Harbour, and had cause of comfort, when the trauell of foure dayes brought vs within the sight of the Iland: Yet looke how a sparke of Fire euen at the very present of his taking leaue of the heate giueth the greater light; so wee gaue a sodaine shoot of ioy, with a Swanlike dittie, at the instant of our destruction: For on a sodaine, a North-west winde whirled the Barke about, and though the Mariners endeuored the contrary, wee as quickly lost, as enioyed the former delight: Then followed a Storme, which with continuance vnited to the Winde, raised a dangerous Tempest: last of all, approached a second Darknesse, wherein the night drew her Curtaines to hide vs from the face of Heauen, had not the contention in those vpper Regions giuen vs more light, then wee wished, because bringing terrour with the Thunder, wee neither durst behold either Earth, or Heauen. On the other side, the Sea hearing the bigg voyce of the Windes, awaked her sluggishnesse, and

perceiuing such variance betwixt the Fire &amp; Aire for superioritie, would not imbace her selfe, but thought to make her greatnesse appeare, as well as they; and so swelled beyond measure, growing to that rage, that wee thought it better to be subiect to Men, then implacable Waues.
                  This continued a whole day and night, and the continuance wroughteffect to put vs in minde of our frailtie, and to make preperation for another dwelling, because the Barcke vnable to house vs, was willing to dislodge vs; and we likewise grew weary of being such Tenants, especially my poore Brother and I, who seemed dying, before death; and ten times dying, to behold the sweete Infants cling to vs for succour, who were not able to helpe our selues: Yet at last Nature preuayling against Wilfulnesse, wee determined to tarry for, rather then to runne to so bad a friend as Death, and therefore agreed to striue with Redresse, if wee could, and to tie the Children to our backes, concluding to change their Names what euer chaunced; and withall, changed our Places, setling our selues neere to some strong Planckes, and Chestes: So, by that time our Genius assured the splitting of the Shippe, I was safe in this vnsafetie on a seasoned Truncke of Firre, and my Brother on a spare Mast; both which, floted for a while neere the dismembred Barke, like silly Birdes houering about their Mother entrapped in a Nette, and leaue her not, till the Fawkner assure, hee is the

messenger of death. What should I say (most mightie King) the feare was more then the danger; and yet may the greatest scorner of Perils, confesse the danger exceeded any meanes, which humaine pollecie had to auoyde it, considering our burdens, and combersome company, which did rather augment, then diminish our griefe. For alas, to be in hassard of drowning amidst the cruell Billowes, desperat of succour, on vnfirme seates, and with infant Princes tyed to our backes, who can but thinke wee had sorrow sufficient, and suppose our heauinesse a wonderfull temptation: At length we seemed cheared with a life cast in a new mold by perceiuing faire weather approching, resembling a condemned person meditating with repentance, and sadly casting his lookes on the ground, as not daring to lift them vp to heauen, till the sound of a Pardon infuseth strength and courage into his decayed soule: whereupon wee setled vp our selues, and began to appease the Children, who as if they meant to finde fault with Fortunes discourtesie, exclaymed on her vnkindnesse by pleading their owne innocencie; which whether it were with the inforcement penetrable, or that the Gods meant to shew their power in contrarieties (I dare not verdict) but presently to our amaze, &amp; their pacification, a gallant calme succeeded, and the outward face of heauen suffered her blacknes to be wiped away, whereby it appeared like the milde mother of the earth; so that it was my good happe

to driue vnder the Walles of Fortona, where a Fisher stood drying his Nettes, whom as I learnt afterwad, was the old Piscaro; and as I had cause to acknowledge, was the honest Piscaro: For seeing some strange thing floting a farre off; hee watched to helpe, if hee could; and graciously helped when hee could: So my safetie increased with his comfort; in which loth to appeare defectiue, hee had me presenty to his House, confirming his Charitie by his good Workes.
                  NOw when hee presumed on my strength, hee questioned with mee about my Shipwracke; Bertosussuffering shipwracke is taken vp by Piscarro &amp; nameth Trezoboro Egerus. and to be plaine, I made a round excuse, as though Cleonidas had set fire on my poore dwelling in Persia, and caried mee Prisoner to his Iland, till a tempest deuided vs, and sent mee floting, as hee found. I but (quoth Piscarro) would a Pirate permit you so much leasure to tie your Child to your backe, and giue you libertie to make such shift? Questionlesse (replyed I) you haue made a pretty doubt; yet must the truth thus resolue you, and fauour him, that out of furie, hee is most pittifull, and worthy of a good report. This was the excuse I made, and with this excuse was my peace made; so that I remayned with him a while rather willing to please, then to complaine of my owne discontentment: but when he found my endeuours consorting to his disposition, as though I ment to checke ingratitude, he professed a further

liking, and very suddenly imparted his wealth vnto me: to be breife with him I continued some fiue yeeres not forgetting the bringing vp of my sonne, who seemed of that forwardnesse (as quickly learning and gracing whatsoeuer he learnt) that my contentment sprang from his expectation: but this manner of life did not long last, because Piscarro, lasted not himselfe, as summoned to a stricter tryall by the irreuocable sentence of death: and preparing for another world made an oueraffection adept me his heyre in this world, &amp; left a stranger to be subiect vnto their mallice, that saw me possessed of his wealth, which though it amounted to no great matter, yet I compassed the dwelling I now enioy, and was able to bring vp Egerius, as you all can partly witnesse: But seeing the winges of time haue thus spread out themselues, and the booke of heauenly reuolutions turneth to this leafe, let not vs degenerat with dulnesse or wilfulnesse, but take out a new lesson, and with reuerence acknowledge him the Emperor Mengrelius Sonne, and remember his true name to be Ptincely Trezoboro: For this is he, whom Gellida and Perinthum gaue me such charge of.
                  But say Coranus (quoth King Zalby) after Bertosus was thus vnkindly seperated from you, what fauour found you amongst the tossing surges? Not much vnlike my brother (replied Coranus) only in being thus deuided my sorrow the rather encreased, and I seemed to lament his losse, as

much as suspect my owne danger: Now belike mischiefe wery of her owne handyworke gaue liberty to an other sceane to alter the act. For within two houres▪ after, the calme presented it selfe, I kenned a farre oft a Fisher boate; who conceiuing of our extremitie made as much hast as my tongue did require their hast: thus was I saued, and by their industry recouered, the old Silenus one of the Shepheards of the Downes commaunding it should be so, and I was glad to finde it so; but more glad, when he brought vs home to his House, where with louing care; and sufficient meanes, wee had the comfortable effectes of good diligence, and 
                        •…

But when I told him I was a man of Husbandry in Armenia, and was taken in a Passage-Boate by the Pirate Cleonidas, as I was traueling into Media to an elder Daughter there bestowed, with this Child, hee much pittied my distresse: But when I tolde him, seeing Fortune was so crosse vnto me (&amp; pouertie must needes prooue combersome, and the discouerer of imperfections) I would take any paines in an other Country to helpe my wants, rather then be a scandall to my selfe, a laughing stocke to my Enemies, &amp; a scorne to my Friends; or at least such, as in former time professed so; hee liked mee as a man of sence, and added somewhat of his owne opinion. But when I told him, that the bond of his Kindnesse had tyed mee to the strict obseruation of Satisfaction; and that I

offered him the fruit of my endeuors in his seruice, Coranus suffering shipwracke is taken vp by Selenus and nameth Brizaca Deltona. he tooke it in good part, made tryall of my industry, and welcommed me accordingly.
                  There I remained vntill Deltona (for so I named Brizaca) was able to apprehend my instructions, and loth to let her loose the benefit of this towardlynesse I obtained of Selenus a Cottage by my selfe, wherin we liued, till she in her life florished, and I in her florishing prospered: For as if the graces had doated on her, each action she attempted was gratious, and I (as if fortune men
                        •…
                      to turne her Wheele indeed,) in euery thing had good successe: in so much that with the admiration of her beautie &amp; gallant behauiour Deltona obtained the chiefe place at the feast: &amp; with regard of the companie, and my owne good vsage, the poore Coranus held the reputation you found him in: therefore (most Noble Duke) looke on her now with other eyes? for no longer Deltona, but the Emperor-Mengrelius daughter; Brizaca.
                  
                  By that time Coranus concluded his discourse, a generall muttering was heard, and raised a manner of confusion amongst them, wherein we will leaue them, till the extasie haue end: and as they begin to conferre of the strangnesse, shall the time acquaint you with the story.

                  To the honorable Lady FRANCIS EGERTON.
                  
                     HONORABLE LADY,
                  
                  
                     I Could flourish the colours of your Prayses from Vertue, Beautie, Gracefulnesse, Magnanimitie, and such like enriching giftes of Nature: But at this time I will extend your worth no further, then that you are a faire promising Fruite of a glorious Tree; and so haue chosen you with the rest, to ouer-shade mee from the tempestes of Detraction, considering I am now like a ceeled Doue to flye abroad with strange disguises, and haue as it were matriculated my selfe in the Schoole of Folly, by writing of Bookes: Yet if you will relieue it, as a poore cast-out Orphan, then are you charitable: If you entertaine it for any cause in it selfe, then doe you Iustice: If you pardon the faults, then are you Vertuous: If you protect it, then are you Heroyicall: Nay, if you make it contemptible, I shall impute it to my owne ill deseruing,

not any deficiencie in you. But casting these doubts aside, I am confident, that you will either giue me leaue to make vse of your Honorable supportation; or lift me vp your selfe with so strong an arme, that neither Enuie nor Derision of others, shall shoulder me aside from your acceptation; or come neere you, that are willing to be so gentle and gracefull vnto mee,
                  
                     Your Honors to commannd,
Th. Gainsforde.
                  
               
            
            
               
                  
                  The Third Booke of the Historie of TREBIZOND.
                  
                     THe truth had no sooner Deltona thus reuealed doth not yet forget Montanus: but confesseth her loue. triumphed in Deltonas discouery, but seemed impatient at restraint, and therfore commaunded fame to diulge it abroad: yet who had at this instant beheld her, would haue sworne shee ment to participate to some excellent artist a very patterne of modesty and humilitie rather then state and magnificense: For there neither appeared alteration, nor any new countenance; only that which seemed new, was a manner of scorne to thinke, how a vaine titell should produce such regard before vertue and desert: Neither would she haue admitted those ceremonies, had not Egerius now her brother Trezoboro perswaded, that though a diamond (howsoeuer set forth) is still pretious, and a stone of estimation: yet arteficially pollished maketh apparant a greater lustre, and augmenteth the vallue and sufficiencie: So no doubt vertue &amp; beautie in Deltona Coranus Child, were guiftes of singular delight and account, but in Brizaca the Emperor Mengrelius daughter, they were perfections and excellencies of admiration: thus she was contented to dismisse her former

stilnesse &amp; feare &amp; appeared, as if maiestie had framed a worke of ostentation, which made the king, Duke, and the rest, burden ignorance with the error of their slight respect, and desired her to pardon the former negligence: to this she was soone directed, and by her excellent behauiour, gaue notice of all those additions, which make Princes famous to their eternall renowne.
                  In the time of this celebration, Montanus seemed forgotten: For euery one busied themselues with the matter in hand. The king to gratefie Rugio to purchase attonement; Trezoboro to acknowledge a Sister, Philano to honour his friend, Coranus in recounting of secrets; and Bertosus in discouering of circomstances: so that Montanus too curiously stomaching the operation of ioy extended alto
                     
                        •…
                     ather toward another, entertained an vnkind suspition of her neglect, which made him retyre to Bertosus house, where his meditation was quickly welcomed to Ielosy and misdoubt, had not Coranus brought him tidinges of better cousequence vpon this occation.
                  
                     Brizaca setled in glorious alteration, began to ransacke the Closet of affection, and found the remembrance of Montanus mourning, that there seemed neede of a new search, which made her challenge the company for his losse; as if she ment to giue them notice, that on his saftie depended her chiefest content. Now was a new hurliburly in the Pallace, and a new humor in the Duke, they

busied in the execution of her pleasure, and he repining to finde a concurrent in his loue: For if before her Comlinesse and Beautie had withdrawne Power from an incontinent libertie, now her Greatnesse and Maiestie rather inflamed, then enamored; which suggested emulation against Montanus, and might haue nourished those despights encreasing betweene riuals, had not the presence of Brizaca caused the returne of better consideration, and her last deniall assured shee was engaged with the bond of Fayth toward him.
                  
                     Thus was Rugio imperiously ruled, and for her pleasure displeasingly pleased: so be sent Coranus and Bertosus abroad, who comming home, found Montanus in a manner ouercharged with griefe. Why how now (quoth Bertosus,) is this the conquerour of Misfortune? and terrour of Licentiousnesse? Did you exclaime against Rugio, to our amase, and disquiet the King with your heroyicke reprehention? Is Brizaca lesse regarded an Emperours Daughter, then when shee was Deltona,
                      the reputed Child of Coranus? Where is Courage and Magnanimitie? Where is Hope and Resolution? Where is Loue and Delight? See Loue, (replyed Montanus) but little Delight: For what goodnesse can I expect, when at the very first, Disdaine and Contempt proceeded against mee? no man more deseruing, no man lesse regarded. Tush (answered Bertosus) Imagination is the mother

of Trouble; let me therefore bring these glad▪ tidings, that how-euer the strangenesse wrought in vs, and extasy was effectuall in them; yet is Brizaca honourable, constant, and resolute toward you. Toward mee (quoth Montanus,) how can a Shepheard bee remembred amongst Princes? Truly (sayd Coranus) if I may speake without offence, ouer-liberally credulous of your Promise, shee reprehended mee for your absence, and sware shee would forget her new name, if it should be an obstacle to her desires. Well (said Montanus) I allow of the deceit, and am content to checke my suspition: I request you therefore like men, let vs beleeue the Gods remaine vncontroulable; and like friendes, suffer mee to make this vse of your kindnesse, to certifie Deltona (for as yet I dare not name Brizaca) that my life and loue dependeth on her respect; whereon I will aduance the trophes of Honour, when that sleeping Fame shall awake to tell her, Montanus is no lesse then a Monarch: In the meane while, I present her my M

                        . Heart; but must absent my Bodily presence. Nay, reply not? For Heauen concludeth, my Geniusperswadeth, and I am vnchangeable. With that, hee hasted out of the Cittie, and left them to maruell at the wilfulnesse.
                  
                  
                     Thus they returned to the Court, assuring the Duke hee was not to be found: But imparting to Brizaca the matter as it chanced, and the manner, as the circumstances effected; in commending

withall his care (exceeding all other care) to be restored to the possession of happinesse: This somewhat setled her feare, and yet troubled her opinion, considering she could not apprehend, whither hee should goe, vnlesse to Placandus. In the meane while, Trezoboro and the Duke, concluded to proclaime their discouerie in all the Kingdomes adioyning; which Rugio consented vnto, as well to make his endeauours plead his affection and desert to Brizaca, as to amplifie his renowne both abroad and at home: wherevpon many Messengers assured diuers Princes, that truth and strangenesse had sent them; and they according to the nature desiring nouelties, by Commission or rather Warrants of safe conduct came to Fortona, ere the limitted time had fully spred her winges, and were welcommed accordingly: so that such as professed in chiualrie, made their cost rather extend to necessitie then wantonnesse; and such as had their Fancies tyed to other subiectes, seemed doubly charged, to make a mixture of armes and delight; but when the day approached, wherein glory determined a solemne inauguration, the entercourse of people gaue notice, as if they went to the Pallace of Honour, and the Duke added to his greatnesse and euerlasting fame, both by his demeanour and expences. In this manner proceeded the Triumph, and the Iudges of the Field were conducted to an imperiall Tent, equally deuiding the Listes, which were King Zalby: Orcanus
                     
Lord of the Blew Ilands: and Nestorius Prince of Oxidracan: the Ladyes discharging their nicetie, were as ready as the multitude, and the Knights came triumphantly forward: Amongst whom the defendants shall receiue this sparing commendation, that their outward brauery and gallantnesse, made the beholders suppose it sumptuous, and the person vnknowne, was worthily liked for his honourable minde and good intent: As for the Challengers (how euer some censor doe except against the time, which had not yet ripened inuention) they may not so slightly ouerpasse my remembrance.
                  
                     Ligornio heire and hope of Bactriana brother in law to Rugio, and newly betrothed to the faire Ramira, a daughter of Artaxerxes Prince of Susiana, had his Caparison of a Sea colour satten, so arteficially embrodered with a tempestuous water deuided into broken waues by the purling of the Silke and Siluer, that the contention arose, whether the cost or the cunning exceeded: for at euery corner of the Quarters, you might descry a Shippe in harbour of safetie. The Mott was: Tandem,
                  
                  
                     Sacromirus sonne of Hircania, ware a purple Veluet, all spotted and embrodred with Panthers; but so done, as wee well might know, Hircania affoorded this Beast exceeding other Countries, and hee affected them surpassing other men, as if hee meant to discouer, that looke what property

Nature bestowed vpon them, hee assumed to him selfe. The Mott: Si saturatus mitis.
                  
                  
                     Seleucus heyre of Margiana, on a curious Cloth of Siluer had in diuers places a Rocke deciphered, resembling that, which protected the Country from inuasion, and assured; the place it selfe was also impreguable. The Mott: Hoc cape et regna.
                  
                  
                     Belnidus the sonne of Carmania, bare a Peachcolour Veluet purled ouer with siluer and gold Wier; but so artificially wrought, that you might perceiue a cut off Head on an Altar, as if hee meant to tell vs, that Loue was there obtained with the price of their enemies Heads The Mott: Sic amor. conquiritur.
                  
                  
                     Culanus King of Sogdiana hauing matched with the heroyicall Tarina Queene of Saca, thought no scorne to blazon her excellencies, and therefore on a VVatchet Satten embost with Gold had her resemblance portrayted, and himselfe kneeling before her, wherein the chiefest care consisted to decipher, that Beautie and Vallour, had doubly enforced his yeelding vnto her. The Mott: Non pudet vinci.
                  
                  
                     Philano sonne to Rugio on an Azure Damaske, bare a resplendant Sun, so excellently embost, that the very Rayes gaue shew of a glorious light; but when we perceiued certaine Cloudes of Silke and Siluer, as it were thrust into a corner, wee then remembred a greater force might put a weaker enemie to retreat. The Mott: Sio gloria desidiam.
                  
                  
                     
                     Trezoboro on a russet Veluet cut in pierced mascelles vpon azure Persian stuffe, had diuers Crownes of Gold-smiths worke; ouer whom an Enameled eye seemed to take the charge. The Mott: Quis amittet?
                  
                  The Duke himselfe ware on an Orenge satten an embrodred Arme, shaking a Sword out of a fiery Cloude, and so wrought, as if it receiued life from a Heart threatning despight. The Mott: Vindicta.
                  
                  Thus passed the Ceremonies of this Triumph; wherein is to be obserued, that Valure and Delight made before-hand a bargaine with Mischaunce, not to enter the Listes, or any way to impeach the Iollitie, being a thing determined for show and pleasure: Yet when it came to execution, the broken Lawnces flew into the ayre, scorning the compasse of a small hold. The Horses wearied with ill managing, disburdened themselues of their vnfortunate Masters. The Knights actiue in their seuerall encounters, (louing Virtue for her owne sake) desisted not for one repulse; but againe and againe made their tryall: Amongst whom, Rugio enforced himselfe beyond expectation (as caryed with a passhionate violence toward Brizaca;) for though hee had broken fourty Lawnces, and ouerthrowne sixteene Knights; yet scorned hee a surceance, till the fortune of the day confirmed the Prize to his worth: But as his forwardnesse insulted with his merit, a suddaine hurliburly at the West ende of the Tilt, exposed

new matter of variety, and came thus to passe.
                  
                     MOntanus went directly to his father Placandus, ouer whom seuerall feares and Montanus commeth to Placandus: his father &amp; prepareth himselfe against the Triumph. sorrowes for the murder of Franio, and the dissipation of his friendes had an vntoward gouernment: but it was quickly deposed by the returne of Montanus, who by this time was welcommed, as if a traueler hauing left a louing wife in the seuerall mistrustes of a dangerous vioage paste hope of returning presented himselfe by miracle vnto her: which occationed some ceremony of kindnesse, as well to strengthen the opinion of Placandus toward him, as to satisfie his curiosity, which neuer left ouer burdning him with questions: Wherupon he tould the old man of the Dukes stealing Deltona, her scorne and Franios trechery: he tould the old man, Coranus had found a brother, himselfe was entertained with Bertosus, and what had chanced concerning Egerius: he tould the old man Mengrelius story, king Zalbys comming to the Court, and Deltonas with her brothers discouery: he tould the old man the entertainement, which followed, the embassage concluded on, and the triumph proclamed, whither he was resolued to goe; which when Placandus rather wondred at, then impugned, hee told the old Man of his misfortunes, the fight

with Cleonidas, and his right to the kingdome of Armenia: To be breefe he tould the old man he was the Prince Anzitemus, of his contract at Mengrelius Caue, and how Deltona remained irremoueable, and vnaltred: of which though the strangnesse slacked his beleefe, yet was the truth so modestly vrged, &amp; the likelyhood of his speeches concurred with such smothnesse, that Placandus reioyced in the hope to find it so, and with a gladsome contraryetie seemed officious vnto him, as if he knew it was so: But when the next morning rumored the like circumstances, he then obserued all the partes of loue and secrecy, and according to his directions made ready Mony of his Cattell, moueables and such like he possessed, with which Montanus furnished him selfe, as conueniently as he could, and at the time appoynted came into the field with a Caparison curiously embost with watchet silke and gold counterchangeably layed vpon the same coulour Persian stuffe: his deuise a lawrell florishing vnder a tempestuous Element, the Mote: Salua tamen.
                  
                  Thus with a seemely Trot he paced to the Tilt, Montanus commeth to the Triumph unknowne. as if he determined to grace their expectation with a thing of some rarenesse: For the Horse commaunded manifested a scorne of wantonnesse by a stately sobrietie; and he commaunding, managed the beast without any wrested mouinges or enforced restraintes: nor was the Duke much discontented with his approach (his courage enterpreting

it a pollecie of Honour to adde more fethers to the Wings of Fame, because he had alredy made tryall of as good men at armes as any in Asia: yet very loth, that mischance should make a mixture with that dayes glory, he shifted his weary Horse, and tooke him to an old Bay, which rather (as if time had altered the coulour) seemed a perfect Chesse-nut, and so supplyed the roome againe, attending the sommons of victory.
                  But when the Ladyes were made acquainted with the noueltie, strange was their desier to know him, strange was their griefe, that none could satisfie their desier: As for the peerlesse Brizaca, though she could haue wished him Montanus; and withall, remembred the good of Montanus: yet not able to thinke, what treasurie in a place vnknowne, had opened her doores, she desisted from supposing him Montanus: But whether, because her minde had runne on Montanus, or that the nature of well wishing extendeth to the weaker side; she once againe allowed him Montanus; and praied accordingly for the same successe, as if it had beene to Montanus; but the Trumpets sound gaue warning to put her other sences in practise; and so the first course began, which passed both with liking to the beholders, and astonishment to Rugio, because they perceiued a sweeter cleannesse in the diuision, and hee felt a quicker strength in his deliuery: yet knowing

                        
conceit was a weakning of courage, and the least aduantage,descried a step to Conquest, hee made ready againe, and so fiue times togeather with sufficient equality concluded, and might surely haue triumphed without impeachment, considering the deeds of Armes, with whose applause he had filled all mens cares the day before: but that the Saddle at the sixt encounter scorned the weakenesse of his Strappes, and vnworthily disburdened it selfe of so worthy a Master; who seemed somewhat perplexed to be so disappoynted, yet was pacefied in the displeasure, when the rest receiued the same payment.
                  In this manner was Glory satisfied to see the Vertue of this new Knight accompanied with good successe, and so the Iudges with semblant suffrages, yeelded the honour of the triumph vnto him: But hee vtterly disclaymed to assume it, considering the Duke had continued longest in the Field, and hee came like an Enemie in ambuscado, espying the best aduantage for his sallying foorth. To this Rugio opposed, as much pleased with his respect, as opinion of the rest: especially considering his hopes toward Brizaca were frustrate, and therefore led him vp in great royalty to receiue the Prize: where the admirable Princesse, accompanied with many worthy Lapyes expected, to whose portion Fortune would allot it: But when a full interuiew had taken away the vaile of doubtfulnesse, it was no kind entertainement,

but a sence rauishing ioy published him Montanus, wherein shee might haue passed the limits of moderation, if Trezoboro had not sommoned her to put her other graces in practise. Now when Montanus found him selfe the cause of this confused silence, and turmoyle, hee thought it high time to pollish the rough way, and lead them to a plaine Field of his knowledge; whereupon hee vsed this preamble. Let not (great Princes) too suddaine a censure passe vpon my presumption or negligence; but rather be incensed against Ignorance, and my owne Misfortunes, if respect haue not passed with her properties: But because you haue already participated with the discouery of this peerelesse Princesse, and yet still continue as a longing and louing Mother for the returne of an other Sonne, affoord mee a litle patience, and I will fill vp the measure of your hopes:Yet in regard the Iourney I vndertake is tedious, and this dayes trauell importuneth repose, I will dispence awhile with the time, and procrastinate your desires till to morrowes conueniencie: But very quickly is the Sunne infeoffed with the nights inheritance, and Trezoboro in his sisters hehalfe (stomaching the delay, hee thought Montanus made) challenged his honourable Promise, and accompanied him to King Zalby, the Duke, and rest of the Princes; who by this, furnished a roome of State, wherein the chiefest things worthy regard was strange expectation: So that after Brizaca
                     
with her princely assistants, had enriched the place, Montanus with a solemne Maiestie rose vp, and with the ceremony of a reuerent obeysance to them, a mannerly chearefulnesse to her, and sweet affabilitie to the rest, thus began.
                  WHom so euer remembrance fauoreth The History of Artabazes and Olmus. with the occrurences of an age forepassed, must needes either read, or heare of the famous victories of Armenus surnamed the great, whose vallure subiected diuers resisting powers, and gaue name to the Country to his obedience reduced: In which hee had not long aduanced the Standard of imperiousnesse, but amongst others, erected two especiall Cittis Sagarena, and Artaxata: The first, corresponding to his Fathers: the second, to her Name; for whose sake the Country submitted to a Strangers wroth. In these hee constituted Lawes for the Common-wealth, and Orders for the Court; which although seemed repugnant to the peoples disposition, by reason they sauored of new inuention, and combined them to a strictnesse, rather wresting their obedience, then animating their loyalties: Yet the good vse by his ouerlooking, setled their grudgings, and established him in a florishing prosperitie; which though misfortune began to impugne by some slender reuolts, and the losse of the royall Artaxata; yet was fully reintigrated in a second Mariage with the magnanimous.

                     Talmiranda Queene of Assiria; with whom hee spent the dayes of his yeares, and the yeares of his glory, glorying so much the more, because Nature imparted her Bountie in many particulers, and Time made the vpshot with expectable issue: For his Sonnes, Artabazes and Olmus shewed in their bringing vp great hope, and in their Fathers life Honourable gouernment. But the aged Armenus must satisfie his debt to the whole worlds creditor, &amp; leaue them in the world like Waxe wrought with a warme hand ready for any impression. At last, sorrow ouerpassed the time of her ceremonious sadnesse, and the noble Artabazes without difficultie or repining, inuested him selfe with the royalties of both Armenias, Assiria, and many Prouinces annexed to his Empire; and so two especiall occasions lifted vp their heades to make them selues knowne to the King: The one, a Celebration of his Mariage with Euphamia heyre of Arach and the three Arabias: The other, a forme of Gouernment, as well to maintaine his Fathers good proceedings, as to auoyde the suspition of his owne weakenesse. In this, after extreamitie compelled a strong Arme to ouerturne Cleonidas House and confederates, euery one applawded his method and manner, and the people were carried with admiration toward him, the rather because he assured, that the like iustice should be distributed as well to the poore as rich, &amp; made his owne example a magnes to draw forward the

steeliest disposition: But when by many particulars tending to a perfect establishment, they found their peace and plentie to florish, then were they violently carryed with zeale, duty, and reuerence: and truly (most mighty Princes) how euer some enuious hand did afterward cast poyson into his vertuous Spring, hee questionlesse layed a sure foundation, as your selues (if you will affoord mee a little patience) may witnesse.
                  For the first thing he vndertooke, was the peopling a mighty Citty in the hart of his Realme, and erecting a sumptuous Pallace in the middest of the Towne; that a reseptacle of all sorts, whom controuersies compelled to tryall of Lawes, this ordained to especiall persons, whom honour incited to follow the Court. The Buildings not yet so much beautified with externall curiousnesse, as firme statelinesse: and the Pallace an inuention of glory and eternity: as hauing sure walles, well proportioned largnesse, stately lightes, easy Staires, great Entries, Princely Galleryes, conuenient Lodginges, wide and magnificent gates, aparted Offices, holsome walkes, sweete Gardens, and dellicate Nurseries: But what was this to the scituation &amp; polliticke aduancement, the ground worke it selfe mounted two Furlonges higher then the other buildinges, and the metation finished with the circuit of a Thousand yardes, all contained within the deepenesse of a double Moat to which industry of man had drawne vp the violence

of many springes, and the circomference of a triple Wall: yet did a stealing hill in such soft vprising direct thee, that what with the brauery of the Marbell paued streetes, and the comlinesse of the euen built houses waling foure great wayes of two hundred foot in breadth, eight hundred yardes in length from the Cittie gate to the first Pallace wall, thou wouldest haue been delighted in the iorny, and wondred with what pleasure thou hadst attained to such height: thus was it stronge to with stand insurrection, and in the midest for the better commaund of the Cittie, and easier prouision of the Pallace: like the heart enuiorned with the body, and the nourisher of life to all the members, they flourishing by the strength of it, and that prospering by the good order of them: Thus was it princely to resuscitate regarde, because the state of Maiestie may not be confounded with communitie, but retaine speciall reuerence. Thus was it named Armamiranda that the people in remembring their well affected Prince might conceiue he forgot not his much deseruing parentes.
                  The next matter of import was to vnuaile the grosenesse of errors, and to reduce the gouernment to vniformitie, which consisting in the admittance of vertue and men louing vertue for vertues sake, selected such, whose integritie of life, and prudent directions warranted their worth for any purpose, as for follie either of her selfe lothsome,

or bewtiched with impietie abhominable, she was altogeather banished: the person whosoeuer reiected for the imperfection, and the imperfection imputed rather to scorne of discipline, then naturall defect. This made the good goe forward in a well troden path, and the bad desist from accoustomed ill life, to which they were as it were directed, by reason so great a king made himselfe exemplary by his owne vprightnesse in iudgment, trueth of word, reposednesse of speech, chearefulnesse of aspect, secrecie of businesse imparted, tolleration of inconueniences, resolution of enterprises, heroyicke proceedinges in matters of Armes, constancie in affliction, and at all times reuerence towrad the Gods.
                  The officers of his house were such, whose demeanour sollicited Honour to remember their worth, or vertue beautified, that Honour before collated to them: yet was no man trusted to the libertie of his owne will, but receiued these instructions, to accknowledge the dignitie of a kinges person, to maintaine the secretes of state and Court, to perpetrate no fact incurring the crime of Maiesty, to detract no time nor occasion, which might set foorth the honour of his kingdome, to admit no vnworthy person, as an officer in Court, to hinder no mans aduancement, that had merited his place, and to depraue, nor depriue no complainant, till his cause were iudicially heard.
                  
                     
His prouidence appoynted a Hundred Senators, as Presidents of Prouinces dispersed through the Empire; to whom he committed Causes of incombrances, and Petitions of the people; not yet withdrawing him selfe from Controuersies of importance, nor forbidding to speake, whom Iniuries enforced; so that the Proude and Mighty were depressed, the Weake and Innocent comforted, and the Worthily regarded, confirmed.
                  The Priestes had charge to watch late, to rise early, to be spare of Diet, sober in speaking, patient in suffering, holy in conuersation, seruent in execution of Sacrifice, impartiall in reprehention, vntainted with priuate malice, no hoorders of Treasure, administers of wants, and keepers of their owne houses.
                  The Noble-men reziant in their Countries receiued these instructions, To haue their Houses stored with seruiceable Attendants, such as should neither be rash, quarrellers, lyers, blasphemers, gluttonous, gamesters, lecherous, or infamed: All which might be easily auoyded, or quickly preuented, if they themselues were milde, honest, sober, silent, patient, familiar, and deuoute: neither murmuring at the haunts of Brothers, Vncles; Coosins, and all other of their kin; nor denying to succour the necessities of poore Allies; or supplying the wantes of crauing Strangers; whose enforced aduersitie deserued compassion.
                  The Iudges of the Kingdome, and Iustices of

each diuision were prescribed rules touching them selues, and had a commission concerning others: touching themselues in no sort to be irregular, not lauish in tauntes, not arrogating vnproper titles; no vtterers of base reproches, no nourishers of impatience, no deriders of former instances, no despisers of ciuillitie, nor others ignorance, and aboue all no deniers of iustice, nor strangers to religion: concerning the people to make stronge weaknesse, to commend courage, to prouide before enforcement, to chastise dissolution, to succour in time, to appease sedition, to obserue conformitie, to cleare suspition, to remedie heuinesse, and to temper the momentary ioyes of prosperity.
                  The Gent: whose youth added Iustinesse to desire, and sufficiency to willingnesse, were aduised (with this caueat not to surpasse their degrees, or endanger their estates) to learne morallitie, as an ornament of the minde, and practise to be actiue for the enabling their bodies, either to Courtly pastimes, as the Prince delighted, or to Warres necessitie, as the Common wealth enforced, whereby was put in vse the running of rases, the swiftnesse of Footmanship, the wrastling by armes, the breaking of Horses, the sleight of the Launce, the casting of Dartes, the benefit of Slinges, the stroke of the Sword, the wearing of Armour, and the aduantage of other weapons: besides the spare time of Countries repose was

bestowed in taming of Beastes by pollicy, force, deuise of Toyles, deceite of pittes, coursing of Dogges, or cunning of Horsmanship: In catching Fowles by counterfeit of Voyce, limings of bush, placing of Ginnes, and exercise of Hauking: In snaring of Fish, by skill of Hooke, groping by hand, casting the Net, opening the sluce, or poysoning the poole.
                  The Marchant was made acquainted to trauell abroad, to obserue his Martes, to learne nauigation, to abstaine from curiosity, to apply himselfe to the place of his Trade, to exchange his commodities, to be certaine of his admittance, and to make difference in the choise of his Marchandise, according to the variety of Countries, each affording natures bountie, and the earthes plentie,
                  The Countri-man had these informations to till the ground, to Plough their seasons, to Sow their Corne, to reape the blessings, to howse their Stuffe, to order their Cattell, to Plant fruite, to sow Acorns, to set Wood, to quicke Ditches, to draine Marshes, to stocke Rootes, to cast Pondes, to sheate Sheepe, to trim Wooll, to weaue Cloth, to spinne Linnin, to dresse Hony, and to practise whatsoeuer labour might attaine to, or conceite imagine.
                  The Artificers were imployed to build strongly, to Wall with stone, to strengthen with Iron, to make warme with Glasse, to heaw Timber, to burne Brickes, to graue in Mettall, to cast Armour,

to digge Mines, to search Welles, to deuise for Shipes, to Tann Leather, and to furnish townes: so that nothing was left vndone, which belonged to the vse of man, nor any thing done according not to reason and wisdome.
                  Thus (noble Princes) flourished the Common-wealth fiue Lustrums togeather, vntill a wanton Securitie set on worke the worst part of mans maliciousnesse, and made euery paltry Controuersie rather a wicked Cauell, then a necessary Complaint: For in short time, many Sycophants grew in the Common-wealth, (like some strange Disease on an infected body, which either carelesnesse or wilfulnesse neglected to cure, vntill it became vlcerous and past redresse,) who neuer desisted from wrong information betwixt Neighbour and Neighbour; whereby they began in Displeasure, and ended in Despight. Many ambitious spirits not able to beare out them selues, suffred Enuie to intangle one another with infinite outrages; so that if one Cause were determined, ten Actions were commenced: and many diuelish Polliticians prying vnder-hand into the demeanors of men, either brought them within apparant Default, or suborned Witnesse against them as, infringers of the Law; whereby euery man feared the conuersation hee kept, and repining Hurliburlies in a manner mutinied against the permitters: but especially when the King (growing mightie and rich, by reason diuers aduantages brought

them within penaltie of some Statute
                        •…
                      and For

                     etures,) became somewhat carelesse in such particulars, as before his Father and him selfe had ouerlookt: Then were vnder Officers left like vnskilfull Pilots in a dangerous Voyage; and the
                        •…
                     e arose a very feare of confusion amongst the people, and lacked but a Head to draw them into action; which though it was not iustifiable in the wrong course so to bee vndertaken, yet was to be pittied in the reasons, they inferred of redresse.
                  For speaking the truth, the men in authority (espetially to whom the determining of controuersies weare appoynted) not onely made benefit of the contentions of the people, but for the insatiablenesse of the benefit subuerted the first good intent of the lawes with quillites and detracting, being cunning indeed in nothing but detracting: besides, touching priuat humours, this ridiculous crossenesse chaunced, that where their owne originalls were for the most part base and obscure, they in the scorne and inueighing against others, laboured yet to ennoble themselues and their Children: Heere also was added the errors of higher officers euery one striuing to aduance his friend and follower to such places, which other men expected for desert, or had wonne with time of seruice and attendancie; nor was this sufficient, but the Common wealth was burthened with strange impositiones, &amp; diuers Monopolies brought

only benefite to some few persons to the generall repining and complaint of the kingdome: For the better sort stomached to see their honour checked and controuled: The men of Armes disdained to be vsed like flowers, which are worne while they keepe their scent, but cast on the Dunghill neuer so little fading: The religious, like their profession, were rather esteemed for a pollecie to keepe the people in awe, then in necessity to tremble at any iudgment to come: other Artists poore for lacke of practise, and therefore despised: the Countryman stoubborne, malitious, and yet outwardly humble enough, vnderstanding but by others instructions, and a little soothed, brought into a Fooles Paradise: Only the Citisen made good shift, by reason nauigation was to be maintained, and the entercourse of people bestowed their Mony amongst them: yet desisted they not from sinister meanes in gathering of wealth, and cruell extremitie in extorting aduantages, quickly suggested by base Brokers and petty Lawiers, who in the end made them resemble that enuious man, who wished one of his eyes to be puld out, so his companion might lose both, which wrought so great feare (by reason Conscience accused them of so many faultes,) that they quickly fined themselues, and when there was no such thing meant, consented to any imposition to maintaine their liberties,
                  Thus grew the name of Lawyer and Officer

more hatefull, then orderly execution: For their Pride and Wealth made them respect no body but them selues; nor any thing, but their owne profite: Now when Pride and Couetousnesse were yoked togeather, like vntamed Heifers vnder the hand of an vnskilfull workeman, the Plough went quickly aside with ill holding, and the Common-wealth grew full of Weedes for lacke of seasonable tillage; which was a long time marked, and as long concealed by the Kings brother Olmus, who quickly apprehended the mislike of the people, and as quickly entertained some strange hope in the apprehension; nor wanted their meanes and helpes to betray his conceite. For some induced him to take the defence of the people into his hands; others dispersed Libels of defamation against the State: Some whispered against the King for not reforming these enormities; others dared to buzze in the peoples eares, that Olmus was of an other disposition; who in deed by this time, affecting a kind of popularitie, soothed each complaint with a pittifull behauiour toward many Suters, and fayre Promises to stand them in what stead he could: whereupon they flocked on heapes, and Olmus the Kinges Brother beginneth aninne uation. made intercession, hee would protect the Common-wealth, offering their liues and goods in profuse manner vnto him.
                  
                     
VVHen Artabazes vnderstood the truth, and that Euphamia pleaded the hazard of Artabazes, stomaching his Brothers, presumption will not induer it but Kills him in the Hurliburly. her selfe and Children, he durst not giue way vnto the mischiefe, for there was no sitting still in hearing of Innouation, but published an apparant mislike of these beginnings, and proclaimed against his Brother, for taking a wrong course and cause in hand: Now? because the ielowsie sprung from the hazard of his Crowne and dignity, it burst foorth into flames of Despight; with which he ment to consume him, had not some speciall Coadiutors vnderpropped his ambition, wherby he was a while reserued, like a man traterously asisted to the Top of an high tree, that his fall might be the greater, when they list to tumble him downe, for presently diuers ciuell Warres ensued, which the people with great feare and charges maintained, and Olmus with extremitie and pollicy continued, as fully resolued, that the fault now aggrauated would neuer admit reconsiliation: sometime passed in this businesse, wherin all mediocrity ouerpassed (both Country and Citties suffering the wrecke of the mischiefe) wherupon a truce was taken, and the king seemed contented to haue their greeuances heard, for which a sollemne meeting was appoynted at Sagarena: but Artabazes incensed to be thus Coorb'd, as he thought, would by no meanes admitte of other Course, then his owne pleasure, perswading his

great heart, or at least his great heart perswading him, that the authority of Kings consisted in commaunding, and not in being ouerruled by audatious disobedience: with which quicke conceit he ouershott to dispute or Reason the matter, and so by forcible entrie broke into the consistory, with a strong hand dismissing the Counsell, amongst whom finding his vnhappy brother, he made the case more Lamentable, because he slew him himselfe, Artabazes Killeth his brother Olmus. and that the company in a place priuiledged were vnable to reuenge it, who yet performed, what they durst, and durst doe no more, then excalime on the action.
                  But the king carelesse of any mans repining, retyred his forces to the Principall fortresse, suspecting what a mutinous Multitude might vnaduisedly yeeld vnto, especially hauing already entertained mislike, and now confounded with new action of distrustes, which accordingly came to passe. For the Cittie dismayed with the report of Olmus death, and terrefied with the speeches of diuers, who gaue out that the King ment presently to sacke it, misdoubted their owne saftie, and were v
                        •…
                     d to Master their forces to saue their liues, which Gestarius incited them vnto (a Minnion of the slaughtered Prince) and with The story of Gestarius. a slender inuectiue quickely exasperated their displeasure. But heere Fortune laughed, first to see a man of iudgement deceiued in an idle choyce: and then the world bewitched to be caried out of

the smooth path of Obedience by a blind guide into the stony and craggy streights of Innouation. For concerning the man, hee was in great credite about Olmus; yet neither bitth allowing the fauour of a Court, nor education meriting any extraordinate liking, onely readinesse of Lip-labour adioyning some outward pleasantnesse to many abrupt speaches (of them-selues, neither in another gracious, nor from another allowable) made the ouercredulous Prince continue his loue; because hee had begun his liking, and admit the person for pleasing his fancie, loth to reiect so great hope, as his cunning perswaded; and vnwilling to bring his first Iudgement in question, which had so much ouerruled him. Touching his Action? as soone as silence was pittifully entreated, hee seemed to excruciate him selfe with sorrow, and began to vtter his minde, yet could not for deepe sighs, nor sigh long for many teares; which proceeding from affection, detained him awhile in some abruptnesse, till at last the strength of his desire to Reuenge, gaue libertie to the tongue thus to dispute.
                  
                     O infortunate people (sayd

                        e) euen after so long goodnesse with the surfet of the same vnfortunate, now are you inuited to a sower Banquet; in which neither courtious entertainement alloweth a welcome, nor holsome Diet satisfaction; vnlesse odious Presumption, arrogant Contempt, wilfull Negligence, vnexpected Oppression, tyranous

Slaughters, and vnnaturall Murders, be the fare you attend, and the Dellicates you hope after: For naught else affoordeth the Disshes of this course, or the courses of this Feast, considering your glory (O yee that were proude in the fruition of such glory) is quite extinguished; but in whom? in Olmus; ô princely Olmus is slaine: But where? in the Pallace temple sacred to the people, and sanctified to the Gods: But how? by force of Armes, and furie of Tyrants: But by whom? by blood thirsty Artabazes, who with his owne hands chased vs from the place, and slew his Fathers Sonne in the Temple; which as I cannot declare without griefe, so I wish not let passe without redresse, considering you importune to haue the gouernment worthy your obedience; and not to remaine in a continuall feare of your ruine: For what shall wee expect, when the Common-wealth hath been made the Tennisball of Fortune, and tossed, as his violence inforced? When the Complaints of the people haue been derided, and irregular wilfulnesse set on foote manie diuelish stratagems; as for the Warres, which hath made vs all smart, they haue been but counted pastimes, and the meanes to disburthen him of ill willers: But concerning our selues, How shall we that be Strangers, liue without dismay, when hee which was his Mothers Sonne died without remorce? Let my very Enemies, whom yet I would not haue enemies to their Country, looke about

with the eyes of zeale and discretion, and then tell mee, if the Kingdome thus distracted, stand not in need of better direction, when they see in all strong compacted Estates, either Wise men be aduanced to authoritie, or men in authoritie endeauour to be Wise? Nor are-we so slauishly bound to the succession of a Monarchy, not yet confirmed with eighty yeares memorie, to submit to priuat insatiatnesse, rather then prouide for publicke good. What shall I say? I protest, neither old rooted Malice, nor any priuate Displeasure of my owne, giueth this euidence: Or as the ill willer may inferre, perpretrateth a crime; but the dangers you remaine in (most honourable Armenianus) to see your Priuiledges taken from you, your Goods dispearsed, your selues made slaues, your Wiues rauished, your Daughters deflowred, and your Citties set on fire, (as if your names were to be forgotten on earth) compelleth this aggrauation: For the Head corrupted, suffreth the Body to perish, and the Minde to be contagious: a Spring poysoned, dissolueth the venom into the running Streame; and the Prince lifted vp like the head of a polliticall body, either of him selfe wicked, or of as wicked as him selfe mis-ledde, quickly ruineth the flourishing'st Kingdome. Then may the Subiects wish amisse, because they hate, and hate in that they can receiue no good: which seeing wee haue such pregnant proofe of, let vs in time, either alter this vntoward beginning, or

depose our new beginning Tyrant: for in our case, wee for

                  No sooner had his rebellious eloquence soothed the conceites of the multitude, but with a mutinous hurliburly (not vnlike a raging Sea swelling ouer some small defence, which caryeth before it what so euer stoppeth his course; or a boysterous Winde, whose violence hurleth downe the greatest and highest Buildings) did they thronge on heapes against the place, whither safety had withdrawne Artabazes; and seeing the Ports guarded, were the more enraged, because resisted; yea altogeather out of patience, as finding a likelihood of Gestarius inuectiue, the most of them not knowing whither they went, nor aduised what to doe; yet because they would bee dooing, did indeed what was not to be done: Some crying it surpasseth Homicide, and no way to be excused; others wished their silence, and inferred there might be a causing circomstaunce: Some whispered the danger of delay, and that there was opportunitie to reuenge all their wronges; others gaue an assault, vainely presuming on the glory of the exployte: Some thought it too much outrage, and therfore seemed halfe angry; others of a more dangerous courage, fearing a slacknesse in the deuision, were the angrier at their anger: Some gaue a caueat to be aduised, least the King should preuaile;

others made vse of that doubt, that no Pardon would euer be graunted, and therefore as good purchase their Peace by force, or make it a generall trespasse.
                  Thus vnstayed hastinesse, the very principall part of trayterous insurrection, deuided their wits, and debarred all motions of alleageance, causing them, which intended to doe well, to practise what was amisse, and such as ment amisse to continue in tenn times worse: so that Artabazes was amased at the wretched vprore, and in a manner confounded to see such a concurrencie of mischiefe; but when he perceiued their outrage bent to entrap his life, and that they had begun a worke of great trouble, he summoned the best aduise he could of preuention, which concluded to winne time, the father of contraries, and by secret flight to preuent the present fury: reasonning thus, either their owne affayres would deuide them to their houses, or the charge in maintaining the Army would proue to comberfome; or the Queene hauing strongly fortefied her selfe in Belcania, would raise and encrease her power, or the neighbour amity of Media would sufficiently reenforce his Army: this his eldest sonne Anzitemus much vrged, because Artabanus the Median King was many wayes tyed in honour vnto him, and to this did they all condiscend, making that night a sudden alarum and with a gallant sally quickely winning the Hauen with the Ships within the

Riuer, wherein no man resisting (for the King Artabazes? leaueth Armenia. commaunding, and was now able to be obeied) they as quickely embarked themselues.
                  But heere you might haue deciphered the operation of base cowardise, and gallant vallure; this of such vertue, that each daunger was as soone ouerpassed, as attempted: that of such changes, that the hurlyburly amongst themselues slue more with disorder, then the Enemie with aduantage: For as Anzitemus gaue the on set, and that the king followed to second him, whole Lanes were made through some few companies new risen, and the suddennesse suffered none to rise, who were otherwise ouertaken: besides, the night encreased the feare, the feare a confusion, &amp; a confusion a most lamentable slaughter, which the King not regarded (as supposing Iustice had taken his cause in hand) but thanking Fortune for the opportunitie, left them amazed at the accident, and setled him selfe to the dispatch of his iourney.
                  By this time some better aduised, then the rest, gathered togeather the dispearsed Forces: but when the light of their Vnderstanding had vnited it selfe to the light of the Morning, and that they saw so pittious aspectacle, and knew the King was escaped, then followed another alteration: For the vnsetled multitudenere disputing on the first cause, condemned the present mischiefe, and began to enueigh against the inchantment of that exercist Gestarius, which had so seduced them:

but when they ouerlooked their damages, and conceiued the matter, as if Iustice had sent them to the house of Correction, then grew the terror amongst themselues more, then their courages against their enemies, none now being enemies, but such as enterprised the defence of Gestarius, who base in very basenesse it selfe allowed each reproch without Coulour or excuse, and suffered the wrecke of their rage with the losse of his owne life which done Pleios a chiefe man amongst them aduised to submit to the Queene Euphamia, whom in all actions they had found a worthy patterne of Ptincelynesse and vertue, and would not now degenerate, considering Gestarius had already receiued the guerdon of a Traytor, and no man remayned, Gestarius death. but trembled to immagin, what the end would haue been, if the King had miscaried.
                  This euery one applauded; and a present submission made intercession for a pardon, but by reason of her feare of Artabazes, it receiued not full life, yet shee accorded, what euer chanced, to make their peace, and they encouraged with her Princely promise disperced themselues, wherupon she sent forth a Pinace, as a messenger of these glad tidinges to finde out Artabazes, which made such hast, that within three dayes it ouertooke them ouertaken with such ill successe, as if mischiefe and destruction indeed had called a dismall counsell to crosse a man,
                  
                     
FOr (most Excellent Princes) euen when they The story of Cleonidas &amp; Artabazes. thought misfortune weary of her tyrany, they descried a Fleet at Sea, the arch Pirat Cleonidas, whom the Ministers of report had certefied of Artabazes troubles, and mingling many lyes with some truth, perswaded, that most men desired his returne and aduancement, to which his former discontentments, and present meanes of Reuenge seemed to flatter him, that if the worst fell out, he might ioyne with Olmus, and so make the same Water that draue the Mill, to drowne the Mill by his comming, causing the Brothers so to weaken one another, that at last he might be warranted to depresse the strongest party: This aduised him to furnish his Nauy, and hearing the voyce of the Windes sound comfort vnto him, made vse of the time, &amp; set forward with speed, vntill he encountred Artabazes Sailing into Media, and thought Fortune very liberall in bestowing such a benefit vpon him: For now the choise of reconciliation or Reuenge was exposed, but Reuenge sounded like Musicke in his cruell eares, as maintained with the life of a more cruell heart; wherupon without parlee, or other amplifieing manner of defiance (more then that he exclamed, how the fauour of the Gods had sent Cleonidas to cry quittance with the sonne of Armenus) he presently assaulted them.
                  But when the name of Cleonidas, wicked Clenidas,
                     
(yea in his wickednesse dishonorable Cleonidas) was vnderstood of Artabazes, neuer came vallure to be so miserably checked (as if the sound of Cleonidas had proceeded from the Trumpet of death) for a sudden stilnesse (far be it from any man to call it a feare) made such a Metamorphosis, that when there seemed greatest need of an embolding courage, then began a misdoubt of death warranting sorrow, which departed not, till a strong party of sighes and teares disproportioned his magnanimitie: at last he remembred himselfe, and seing his sonne Anzitemus, as it were ouerlooking him, caught hold of his Arme, and thus spake: O the strength of my life? O my Anzitemus? Be not dismayde at this extasie, nor impute the titell of Cowardise to the father of such a sonne, but the only opinion, &amp; the now examination of the same, which I conceiued of the wise Dermastro, who long since in a greefe-working sadnesse assured, that Cleonidas would be omninous vnto me hath ouerswaied that allacrytie, which I once supposed no mischance should distemper: yet I protest, this is not troublesome in regard of my selfe, but for thee, whom I haue doublie and irrecouerably betrayed and abused: But necessitie made a breach of his speeches: For Anzitemus (answering no otherwise, then liue Artabazes in despight of Cleonidas?) was enforced to the fight, and so disposed his Ships, that Cleonidas determining to Grapple, thought to discouer some

                        
aduantage by Wheeling about, and turning his Sailes. And as when two mightie Rammes enraged with the smart of well inforced stroakes quickly part themselues, and to the vnexperienced make a Cowardly retreat, butindeed to meete againe with sorer fury: so acted Cleonidas his part, for what with animating of some, terrefieing of others, and his owne example he set forward againe, and becircled the ship, wherein Artabazes was with foure greater: Now who had seene the peerelesse King for his worthynesse could not, but haue thought valure rightly bestowed, such was the slaughter he made, such was the confusion, which followed: The shipe full of dead Carkases, full of dying men, full of wounded fighters, himselfe bestowing no blow, but like a Messenger of Reuenge and ouerpressed with number like a Minister of rage, as for the rest, the valiant in their deaths outfaced death, the coward saw his shame rewarded either with miserable slaughter, or slauish Captiuitie: the Ships were suncke and dismembred, and Anzitemus began to be ouermastred fighting with Cleonidas, which when Artabazes perceiued, his impatience was so great, that Terror it selfe might haue beene dismayed at the distemprature: For a strange fury began a strange action ouerthrowing all resisters, making some Armelesse, some Headlesse, some Liuelesse &amp; desisted not, till he approched the place where his sonne fought, and displacing him began

the Combate himselfe, which continued in such a fashion, that Anzitemus was deuided from them, though his handyworke had wrought the Miracles amongst the company: at last Artabazes (as angry, that it stood him in no more stead) threw away his sword, and closing with Cleonidas supposed with maine strength to throw him ouerboord.
                  Heere began a new contention, as if destruction ment to shew the beholders variety, but after many windinges, shouings, and turnings both strong, both cunning, the Pirat was ouerthrowne, but not with that quicknesse, but Artabazes fell two, compelled by the fast holding one another: thus lay, they both breathing, both fainting, till Cleonidas awaking the very secrets of mischiefe, and perceiuing the neerenesse of his owne Ship gaue directions to tumble them togeather therin, which whether they neglected thinke (Noble Princes) Cleonidas carieth Artabazes away prisoner. when it was as quickly done as spoken, and the Enemie to manhood-commaunded to vngrapple, and so to depart with their gotten Prize, which though Anzitemus striued to intercept, yet Fortune vnwilling to his destruction infringed his desiers, and left him dying in seeing his father so captiued: and Tenn times dying in the succorlesse helpe remaining: nothing with holding his owne entrance into the house of death, but hope of Cleonidas death, which very shortly he had time enough to meditate on, though slender meanes

to execute: For when his eyes returned from their dastardly flight, as they termed it (because they might as well haue Triumphed ouer him) to regarde his present estate, and that he found of sixteene Saile &amp; two Thousand men but two barckes, and fiftie eight in saftie, suppose he remained rather not knowing how to dye, then wishing to liue: at last the life breathing Counsell of Ardmeio, faythfull Ardmeio recaled his spirits, and thus dispelled the combersome enemies of courage; Honorable 
                        Anzitemus leauing further ampliation of Titles, let deuine resolutions be rather reuerenced, then disputed on; let hūaine actions be rather accounted the subiects of change, then Anchor hold of perpetuitie; let vertue be still it selfe rather to redresse mischiefe, then maintaine prosperity; Let time haue her allowance, and what we suppose vnlikly, that will dispose vnlookt for: This I am bolder to inferre, because without doubt a secret influence doth none ouerrule, and might in some persones effect demissnesse, but in you, where the better part remaineth vnassaulted, which is magnanimity, let that apply and imploy it selfe to redresse, wherin no doubt as your constancie shall appeare, your succour shall approch: proceed therefore in your iorney to Artabanus? Whose ayde may set you forward into Persia, or whersoeuer Cleonidas is supported: or if you please you may returne into Armenia, where I am sure, if you will take the protection of the Kingdome into your hands, you shall

be able with loue and leasure to raise sufficient power to plucke Artabazes out of the lawes of destruction.
                  But Anzitemus vtterly neglected, yea in a manner despised the motion of returning, protesting neuer to returne, vnlesse Artabazes did returne; or both ouerturne their liues right to her contraries vsurpation, and therefore tooke the other course of going to Artabanus; where he was without scruple or diffidence entertained. But (most royall Princes) Misfortune followed like a a shadow; for wee found the Noble king in such distresse as there seemed no hope of our recouery: Then belike (quoth the Duke) you were a party Montanus discouereth himselfe to be the Sonne of Artabazes. in this businesse? Great Duke, I was; and to bee plaine, am that vnfortunate Anzitemus the first borne of Artabazes, vnfortunate in being that I am; but ten times vnfortunate in not being at all.
                  O Thou life of the World! thou glorious Montanus hauing discouered himselfe to be King Artabazes Sonne by the name of Anzitemus maryeth Brizaca. Sunne, (quoth Ligornio Prince of Bactriana) Who hath not heard of Artabazes misfortune? Who hath not heard of Artabanus successe? Who hath not heard of Persias troubles? Who hath not heard of Anzitemus victories? With that, hee arose to imbrace him: Nor were the rest of the Princes so vnsatisfied in opining his Discourse, as once to suppose there were errours in the same; but likewise arose, as if indeed the same of his actions, and greatnesse of his birth,

had read them a lesson of respect and reuerence: Whereupon Ligornio tooke the King Zalby and the Duke aside, and gaue them notice, whom Fortune as malignant had thus turmoyled, whom Vertue as predominant had thus conserued, whom Fame as triumphant had thus eternised; which Rugio (hauing long since receiued the deuision of report) willingly acknowledged and therefore with true Honour welcommed him by the name of vertuous and victorious Anzitemus: then followed the King, then the rest: last of all, as the Iudges before led him to receiue the Prize from Brizaca, they now conducted him to be receiued Priselesse of Brizaca, alleaging that neuer deuine fauour could open the Treasure house of bountie vnto them, as now to behold the Pallace of Fortona the place for truth and strangenesse to display the ensigne of admiration, for loue and beautie to March vnder the standard of vertue, for vallure and magnificence to flowrish with the Coulours of Maiesty, for Riches and contentment to conduct the Vantgard of delight, and heere to appoynt the Rendezuous, as if they had concluded a Triumph of happinesse; The Gods therefore forbid (quoth Rugio) that any default of mine should intercept your desires: loue him then Brizaca? Loue her then Anzitemus? and long may you liue to loue, and not liue, except you loue one another.
                  Great was the grace affoorded Rugio for this:

great was the ioy the Kings and Princes made for this, great was the amaze the Court shewed for this, great was the applause the people yeelded for this: but when the royall Brizaca seased once againe on her comfort, and that her happinesse extended in the highest degree of equality, shee thought it inequality in the highest degree no

                      led a publicke solemnisation of a new contract: nor seemed the euer-willing Trezoboro to repine at his Sisters choyce, but made vp the defects of the confort with his plawditie. By this time, the household Officers couered for the Feast, and the Trumpets sound gaue warning of a new worke so the obseruations of good Customes adiorned further conference, and with seuerall delights posted the seuerall howers of that day; Rugio striuing to set foorth his owne greatnesse, and the Princes much pleased to receiue so full contentment: Yet the youthfull Trezoboro and diuers others, to whom the report of strange aduentures seemed instigations to as strange performances in themselues, were vnsatisfied in the broken off Discourse of Anzitemus proceedings, vntill Ligornio to doe them a pleasure; and least Anzitemus should be too sparing, speaking of him selfe, (but especially to allow him opportunitie with the much desired Brizaca, to whom he might at leasure, yeeld accomp

the next day to finish his Story: which Anzitemus gratified as a kindnesse, and so left the Prince to pensell on the Table of his renowne.
                  AFter the ciuill Warres of Persia (quoth the Prince) had made the Seruants of Bellona 
                     Ligornio porceedeth in the History of Artabazes, &amp; beginneth with the story of Artabanus and Astiages, wearie in executing her bloody Commandements, a pacification was effected in the election of a man fitte for the gouernment (which at last, though Artabanus King of Media, a Prince of sufficient power, and more suffitient direction, was nominated) yet fell to the share of Astiages, by reason of his blood, education, and commorance amongst them. This Artabanus tooke in ill part, and was amongst the Medians a reputed contempt; nor wanted there such, which inferred, that the scorne was greater in the resusall after they had by their Embassadors vrged it, then if the matter had neuer been proposed: Of this sort, the especial of
                        •…
                      man was Medormus, who well hoped for the Crowne of Media, if Artabanus obtayned the other: whereupon an ambitious Counsell of Warre concluded reuenge, and confirmed the manner by inuasion, the rather because Adelphus Duke of Alstratia offered the disbursing of great summes of his owne, and tooke vpon him the conduct of the Army, which consisting of foure-score thousand foote ten thousand Horse, and foure

thousand Camels for burden, made him presume, that Astiages in the inchoation of his Peace, was not able to raise sufficient forces to withstand him, considering his Souldiers hauing the prey and spoyle of a Country (worthy any title) exposed vnto them, seemed impatient at restraint; and indeed performed their duties in the best manner; as when you see a costly Prize erected at the end of a Goale, and the runners striuing to make it the Trophe of their victorie: For at their first entrance they began with subuerting of Houses, felling of Wood, fiering and cutting of Corne, dryuing of Cattle, ensconsing of Wayes, and making of Forts: But Astiages vnwilling that the Earth should bee vnfurnisht of her golden Apparell, which already the vngentile multitude had presumed to disrobe; and forecasting, least the best part of his Country should be the Seate of the Warre, came forward in person, with a full and well furnisht Armie, compounded of all those Souldiers, which in the ciuill Warres were vnnaturally caryed against one another; but now finding the sweetnesse of a little Peace, determine absolutely for the honour of Persia, and within seuen dayes made the tryall of Swordes warrant their affection to their King and Country.
                  Thus both the Armies are driuen to a mighty encounter, not vnlike to a dusty Path dauncing to and fro as obedient to the Winde, till an extraordinary violence whirleth the vppermost 
                           •…
                        olde,

that a man would wonder, how one blast should so soone deuide so great an Heape; by which vnfriendly greeting, the one party hath great cause to lament; the other small reason to triumph: The Earth bled for woe, considering the effusion which was made, made her change colour, and receiue vnnaturall moysture: The Beastes whose seruice consisted in the skilfull managing of the Rider, lay dismembred, the men whose cunning was countermaunded by vnfortunate aduantage fell dismounted: The Captiue supposing the law of Armes would haue serued his turne, is suddainely stab'd, the Triumpher is ouertaken with an others weapon in his owne bowels, ere the Blade is out of the others body: One-while the Persians troope with applause of preuayling, anone the Medians shoute with ioy of victorie, as when you see a mightie presse of people, sometime shoouing forward with a murmuring noyse into that corner; sometime backward into this place, and many times confused with the cry of the company: To conclude, what Stratagem disorder of enrage euer performed was now for the manner dangerous, and the number lamentable: For had not the night hasted to decide the quarrell, some other Company must haue ended it, considering it would soone haue ended them. Thus are the Persians retyred with great damage, and the Medians entrenched with small gaines; who slenderly mooued with this defeature, are not at all remooued

from their first wilfulnes, but determine, that new supplyes shall make another tryall to pay their double losses: So haue I seene an vnskilfull Archer loosing one Arrow, to shoote another after to find it, till taking great paines in the search, he like a foole returneth with the losse of both: Whereupon Adelphus sent Poligambus into Media, who certified Artabanus of the vnfortunate disaster, extolling indeed aboue truth, the force of the Enemie, to deminish their owne shame in their ouerthrow; but this newes was not so ill of it selfe, as in the efect it procured. For Medormus taking aduantag of these particulars, that the losse in Persia would busie them heere with forren occasiones: that the supplying them would much troubted the kingdome: that the absence of the kings best friends gaue him oportunitie to strike the Iron, while it was hott; and that his owne abillytie seemed euery way strong enough for the attempt, made a strange, cruell, and Trayterous reuolt; wherein without doubt a prosperous beginning had been sustained with vnpropper successe, if by the ariuall of Anzitemus the maske of despaire had not been taken off, and a new Countenance of hope smiled on the discomforted King, discomforted not so much in displeasure of his owne affaires, as in the despight of Medormus vnkindnesse, who had so kindly been beholding vnto him, as your selues may thus witnesse.
                  
                     
                     ARtabanus now raigning, was sonne of Artabanus Otanes, who had the title of a father The story of Medormus and Gliranda. doubled in enioying also a Daughter called Gliranda, &amp; his ioy redoubled in those giftes of nature, beautie, and Maiestie, which excelled in her, and the rather excelled, as yeelding to the gouernment of vertue and obedience: vntill some violent humour willingly lifting ope the Gate of ambytion made a strange loue, the vnnaturall cause of a strange hate. For somewhat pleased in the gallant youthfulnesse, and well deseruing towardlynesse of this Medormus, sonne of Cestus brother to Artabanus the father, after many circumstances and endeuors to purchase her liking, she admitted rather with a gennerall curtesie, then any particuler affection, his discourses and desiers: but when his loue was pleaded with resolution, that neither father nor brother should be any obstacle for her head to be impaled with the Crowne of Media, vrging his right indeed by being the elder brothers sonne, a matter long since (as shee partly heard in question, and determined otherwise) neuer was vertue so out of countenance: For admitting his reasons and inducements, she rann Arme in Arme with him in the race of a violent Treason: yea such an impression had the expectation of her glory made, that in the infant time of her abortiue proceedings she stomached lesse reuerence, then what is accoustomed to Queenes,

and was not ashamed to proclaime her now title, and defiance against her Father: nay more, after the discouery, and that they were preuented, she dared to exasperat the kings displeasure with a kinde of impudencie, who enraging to see such offenders past shame, commaunded the prerogatiue of Maiestie to proceed against them, wherby without question they had both lost their liues, as before they had done their loyalties, if her brother Artabanus now raigning had not importuned a hard returning mercy: yet could not the father so passe ouer the vnkindnesse: For he presently entertained all the Ministers of rage and discontentment, by whom'he was quickly miscaried to the house of sicknesse, wherin only able to assure his sonne, that Kings permitte neither concurrent nor Competitor, with a life fainting farewell, he bad him remember his father, and looke to himselfe.
                  Now encreased new troubles, because Medormus and Gliranda set on worke new Treasons, as perceiuing one only obstacle to debarte their progresse to the dignitie, which made them contriue to remoue it, wherein they went somewhat cunningly to worke, causing a good mother to bring foorth a bad Childe, and vnder Coulour of an Honorable exployte to incite Artabanus to the inuading of Persia, not doubting but he might miscary in the danger, or they by his absence haue conuenyency to reuolt: but when the kings

sending Adelphus had thus disappointed them, the very despight discouered, that there is no confidence to be attributed to a reconsiled enemie, who like the Serpent of Nilus came fawning, creeping, yea and shed teares, till he was able to reach his prey, and then Murdred him without remorse, 
                        〈◊〉
                      so wrought with them from acknowledging a life sauing benefit, that they once againe attempted a death working Catastrophe: a Catastrophe I may well terme it; as hauing a double reference both to the king, and themselues: For soothed, or rather betraied to this opportunitie of Artabanus forces ouerthrowne in Persia, they begann an intestine broyle and innouation in Media, which shewed the countenance of such miserable towardlynesse, that the king was enforced to fortefie himselfe in the Cittie of Abadod, where commonly his Court was kept, and the people were euer carryed with a Zeale toward him: heither did Medormus prosecute him, and within seauen clayes after Anzitemus ariuall (to whom for the strangnesse and crosse variety the King imparted both the one and the other Warre) miserably deseiged him.
                  When Anzetemus perceiued to what tryall his patience was enforced, he repined at the troubles, rather then was troubled with any repining, because his owne determination for Artabazes deliuery was procrastinated, and he himselfe must needes be engaged for Antabanus releife: yet

making vertue of necessitie; and willing to affright Conceit with some imployment, hee offred the king two especiall iewels of his treasurie, Direction, and Encouragement; that in regard of his louing Cittisens, whom hee meant to protect: this in respect of his disloyall Subiectes, against whom hee determined to proceed; whereupon a summons brought them to hearken after a Parlee, and Artebanus out of the Window of a Port, thus deliuered his minde.
                  
                  
                     I am gladd louing, and yet disordred louing Friends, that I speake to such, who by their quiet attention make shew at the first, of wisedome &amp; obedience; I will therefore without euasion, or challenging this vnkinde and vnnaturall bearing of Armes against your King, come to the purpose in deed: If then my defects and extremities haue been so narrowly searcht into, that I seeme vnworthy to enioy my Inheritaunce, I was neuer so vntractable to reiect good counsaile and aduise: or if they haue been so vnnaturally vrged against mee, that you cannot beare the burden without a reuolt; yet you might orderly haue discouered your griefes, and desired reformation: for I protest before the Reuenget of all Treasons, that I ioyne with you in well wishing to haue Goodnesse flourish, Prudence direct, Fortitude protect, Iustice controule, and Temperance moderate: Or if any better course might like a quiet working Potion, be administred for the health of this Polliticall

body, the patient is not so distempred to cast away himselfe: But if priuate grudges haue led you out of the smooth paths of reason to the ragged and stony streightes of passion, returne for shame, least your foolish choise scandalise you to the world, or for feare, least you be driuen to an vnpreuentable destruction: But if the ambition of others hath detained you in the bondage of impossible hopes and flatteries, shake off the deceite, and with the eyes of discretion behold your owne weaknesse,, considering Iustice correcteth the offender, as well as rewardeth the well deseruer: But if M

You haue Iustice on your side, and conscience bidds you assist me, that am wronged, as for Artabanus, he vsurpeth my right, and as the best of you can tell, so did his father deale with vnfortunate Cestus his elder brother; goe on therfore; goe on; I

say againe goe on, deuide the Kingdome at pleasure, and make your owne peace and prosperitie to flourish. But for all this golden field of Promises, the third part of his Armie the next night shrunke from him; and were doubly welcome to Artabanus, both in the succour by the vniting his owne Forces, and the benefite in making knowen Medormus secrets: whereupon Anzitemus perswaded to sally, reasoning on the dishonour? for a Subiect to encage so great a King in one silly Towne.
                  This was so forcible with Artabanus (who looking on Anzitemus with the eyes of Iudgement, wondred with what setled grauitie his Counsailes were deliuered, as if maturenesse had brought him from the wanton aboad of Youth to the house of Wisedome,) that the men of Armes were that night deuided into two parts: the one left with the King, as a sufficient guard for the Citie: the other committed to Anzitemus, as an able Armie for the Field; with which by breake of day, hee sallyed foorth, and resembled a beautifull Plant newly come to some shew in a Garden, which euery looker on praised, as an Ornament to the place, and feared, least some misfortuue might ruine before his time: But Medormus made vse of his Souldiers reuolting, fortifying him selfe the stronger, doubling his Watches, and in person ouer-looking his Campe and Trenches, whereby hee was prepared at all times; and so when the Alarum was giuen, quickly made it an equall tryall: and although the

valiant Anzitemus whirled in the thickest presse, weakning the troopes, abating the strength of the Enemie, reuersing the dispaire of the fainthearted, and prosecuting actions beyonde expectation, whereby his glory was both published, and stomaked; his friendes amased to behold magnanimity so well bestowed, and his enemies confounded to finde the vallure of one man so sufficient: yet were the Medormians so resolute, and encouraged, that Anzitemus would not be further engaged, then his owne forces might purchase a freedome, &amp; therfore made an honorable retreate, as when you see the afterdrops of a storme continue in the greatest force at the parting: This he accoustomed many times besides, as if destruction ment to play the wanton with the company, rather lessning their number, then their hate; which so discouraged Artabanus, perceiuing no other hope then the calamity of his Realme, and confusion of the people, that he determined by single combate to preuent these reuenge-crying massacres, resembling the Pellican, who by hassard of her owne life, feedeth and preserueth her young ones.
                  
                  NOw when Anzitemus perceiued so gallant resolution, hee could not mislike the same; yet checked his owne slacknesse for not being author of the matter; and therefore to make as it were satisfaction to his opinion, hee

vrged Artabanus to elect him Champion of his cause, not so much in deed to confirme the King toward him, as to try Medormus; ouer whom hee was in a manner emulous: Againe, supposing in the preuayling an euerlasting league would be combined, or in the default, his troubles should end with his owne end: Heere grew a vertuous Contention betweene Artabanus and Anzitemus, the one inferring the vnreasonablenesse of the cause to bring a man of his deseruing into so great danger for an others businesse: the other, insisting on his desire to match the Aduersary vpon equall tearmes: at last, Anzitemus preuayled, and a Hearrold Artabanus offereth priuat Combate to Medormus which Anzitemus performeth for the king. for the King proclaymed the Defiaunce; which Medormus durst not but accept, because the Company ouerboldly vrged him, that a Prince in possession was willing to aduenture both life and dignitie; and they them selues were almost tyred with butchering one another. But when Gliranda euer doting on his strength, and cunning in matters of Armes, alleadged the likelihood of successe, hee neuer disputed, but appoynted time, place, and manner; which was by prime of day at a fourtnights end, a full mile from the Cittie, and like a Knight on Horse-backe with Launce, Sword, and Shield: And although in the meane space, some quiet spirits laboured betweene the parties, wishing Artabanus pacefied toward his Sister and Medormus; and vrged Medormus to submit to the King, whom Vertue would questionlesse

bring to the house of Pardon; yet hee misconstruing the Moderation of Peace-makers, was wilfully bent to put all to this tryall.
                  Thus is the day come, and the dignity of the King compelled some magnificent Shew for the furnishing of Anzitemus. First, diuers Purseuants at Armes gane notice of Artabanus approch, and a L. Marshall with a hundred Seruants all well appoynted, so deuided the disordered multitude, that the way seemed a liuing Wall, as if the men had admitted direction by line and leuell: then followed two hundred Courtyers on horsebacke richly apparrelled for their owne credits, and the Kings Honour: Next matched owne hundred Gent. on foote all in a Liuerie sutable, which was a Roabe; Morisco fashion almost to the small of the Legge of flame coulor Veluet, yet so darkned with black-silke and gold-lace, that you might easily imagine, there was sorrow mingled with his glory, they had Sea caps embrodred sorting to his Imprese, semiters according, and halfe buskins of white Spanish Leather enclosed on the outside with flame coulor Ribbin: Then followed twenty spare Horse, on whom rode so many Pages bearing seuerall sheilds with his deuice, which was a ship in full Saile betwixt Scilla and Caribdis, the Mott, As ill is to come, giuing notice his troubles were not ended, though he should atcheeue this aduenture: after them rod fiue Knights with his caske, Launce, Sword, Shield and Horse, which

was trapped in a sumptuous and curiouse caparison of Cloth of gold, wrought like flames of fier couered ouer with rowles made like waues of Sea water greene Cipers, in such an artificiall loosnesse mingled with the stuffe, that you would haue supposed the water to haue quenched the fier, and the fier to haue burned the water, besides they were hooked togeather with great Claspes of Goldsmiths worke ritchly Enameled, but more ritchly beautified with Diamonds and Rubies. Presently followed a new fashion Chariot made like a Rocke irremoueably standing for all the waues seemed impetuous against it, which by reason of the motion of the Wheeles tossing water against it indeed, like the violence of a Mill, resembled a tempestuous Sea: Vnder it, or rather within it satte Anzitemus and Artabanus, who in a pleased grauitie and yet displeased Countenance gaue the people to vnderstand, his care was not so much for his owne glory, as their safty: The Rocke was tyed to certaine Cables made of blacke Silke and Gold, which had their seuerall fastning to sixe Pinnases, so well deuised, that the Horses enclosed within them gaue action full libertie, and they Sailed with the Rocke away, as if they determined to drawe it out of the Sea: but the faster they went, the sorer did the Billowes threaten by beating on the sides, yet stood the Rocke strongly founded, assuering that vertue and magnanimitie remaineth integrate, what aduerce crosses so

euer chaunce. Round about went fiftie Gent. on foote, the younger sonnes of Noble men with Pollaxes in their hands, whose neerenesse to the king gaue notice of their Honorable place, and credite. After followed the Officers of his Court, Guard, &amp; Attendance; and last of all, fiue thousand armed Souldiers brought vp the Reare, who well marshalled with their Commaunders and Officers, was not the least grace to the Trimuph.
                  Thus Artabanus came with Anzitemus, and Anzitemus with Artabanus into the

                  First a fame on Horsebacke diuulging her hate to secrecy sounded a very Warlike diuision: next followed diuers gallantly mounted with the seuerall Penons of all his Troops: then came fiftie Gent. on foote all apparrelled a like in an vpper Roabe of Arabia; the stuffe Crimsen Veluet, the fashion

open before, cutt vp behind, and of each side: all places yet enclosed by reason great Gold-lace Buttons made of intricate knottes, were folded within the circuit of the like Loopes: On their head the attyre now vsed in Turkestan, but long since in Siria, made of Crimson &amp; yellow Cipers rowled compony togeather, and thicke beset with Spangles: behinde almost to the Calfe of the legg hung a Scarfe fastned to the rowles of Crimson-Taffata, all ouer embrodred with Crownes: By their right side a short Sword, guilt in the like coulored Sheth, as if they had been all left-handed, and signified, that what enheritance could not challenge, by one meanes or other he would obtaine: their S

                     ockinges were of Yellow famitt, and Shooes of red Leather, as if they purposed for their Maisters sake to tread in Bloud: Then rode fortie Knightes his Allies and confederates, Armed in guilt Armour pounced with a Garden of Marigoldes, and a heauen ouerspredding with a glorious Sunne in it, as if he were the Sunne of their glory, whom like the Marygold they would obserue for he had giuen them already Guilt maces in their hands, resembling Scepters with intent to inuest them kings: After followed tenn Pages on somany spare Horses richly caparisond with seuerall deuises, but their sheeldes had one Imprese, which was an Arrow flying out of a Bow to the Element: The Mott higher then another: next attended three Knightes with his Helmett,

Shield, &amp; Launce: Then came he himselfe proudly mounted, his Armour sumptuously enameled with certaine Crosse-bowes, which were no way to be bent but by force, but to see them of Goldsmiths worke richly embelished with Rubies and Opalles, orderly marshalled all ouer a Crimsonveluet Caparison; you would sure haue taken him for the Sonne of Mars, or Seruant of Honor: On his left Arme hee ware a Scarfe of Orenge curled Cipers all ouer tufted with Womans haire, made fast vnder buttons of Gold, quadrated with rich Diamonds. This Gliranda bestowed vpon him, as assuring shee would spare neither Hayre, nor Heart, to forward the enterprise. Last of all followed diuers companies of his Armie, not in mistrust of any vnlookt-for surprysing, but to giue the King notice, their obedience vnto him was not altogeather forced.
                  Thus is the comicall Shew presented, and many sportiue obseruations streamed about in a smoth channell: But now enters Death and Destruction to bring in a Tragedie, and the Princes summoned to doe their deuoire, with a gallant speedinesse make a stop in the midst of the race; so that what with fulnesse of their Strength, the swiftnesse of their Horses, the surenesse of their Armour, the cunning in their Deuision, and their iust Meeting togeather: the Launces were weary of their length, and the Knights might for neerenesse imbrace one another: But this was soone forgotten,

and their vnsheathed Swordes put them in minde, they were drawne to some purpose: so began a gallant Turny, which likewise had his passage, till Medormus quietly gathering vp the raines of his Horse with his Bridle hand set him againe loosely forward, and indeed was the first, which stroke a blow of aduantage; wherein if hee had not ouer-liberally yeelded to his haste, it had made an excellent try all of the deliuery, whereas it now slided by without any setled damage: But when Anzitemus felt him selfe burdened with smart and shame, hee reprehended his slacknesse, and set a taske on his courage to requite it, which by this time, made anger follow apace; yet loth to strike him behinde, and vnable to wheele about, with a reuersse he hit him on the side of his head, &amp; comming fortunatly forward, stroke him againe, as if hee meant to tell him, there was two for one. Quite was Medormus out of patience, and so put an action of distemperature in practise, by bearing his Shield ouer his Sword with a maine careere at his aduersarie, who apprehending the mischiefe, fortunately receiued it on the outside of his; which vnable to resist the force, vnwillingly deuided it selfe, and Anzitemus was glad he escaped so, supposing a slender losse sooner recouered, then a greater, which made him imploy both his warinesse and diligence the better, that hee desisted not, till Medormus best defence was broken, disioynted, and vnable to stand him longer instead; who

                  THis was for the manner &amp; the parties querimoniall, but soone ouer passed, in regard Anzitemus

                     Artabanus Sonne. Neuer was Counsell better bestowed; for though Anzitemus thought by this contract, to reduce his confused businesse to some forme, and so to be able to circumuent Cleonidas, where soeuer hee lurked; or at least to redeeme his Father: yet they apprehended it, as the voyce of some good Angell for their happinesse, and without more adoe, elected the Honourable Mulcasses to the Embasie; by whose Commission, Adelphus Artabanus Lieuetenant generall in Persia, was against his will discharged, because in deed the Souldiers were disappoynted in their expectation, as euer louing better Booty and Spoyle, then Pay, or strict Obedience to home Commanders. But certified of Medormus treasons, and how honourably Anzitemus had behaued himselfe, they quickly returned to the sweet walkes of loue and dutie, and allowed Mulcasses authority: So Adelphus leasurely gathered vp his Army, and yet departed not quite out of Persia, till hee vnderstood Astiages answere; who keeping his Court at Susiana, (whither hee had withdrawne his Forces to garison) entertained Mulcasses as a Messenger of peace; and after audience, limitted a time to receiue his satisfaction.
                  But after he was fully dismissed, the monstrous enemies of Prosperitie, Enuie and Wrath made an onset against the Kings honour, and so battered the citadell of good thoughts, that hee could not depresse his malice without discouering it thus to

                     My Lords: I am sure, you will not be so sparing in your regard toward the renowne of Persia, and my Honour: but you remember the disgraces offred my fathers house by the first Artabanus, who many yeeres turmoyled with a Ciuell-warre our Country, and denied our right to this Kingdome: and now you see Artabanus his Sonne, as his Father against the Law of nature would haue disappointed vs, against the Law of nations, hath intruded himselfe, my auncestors cast cleane out of doores by a mutinous rebellion, and I not permitted the saftie of my hard gotten peace: yet you see Iustice hath taken my part a little and Fortune openeth now the doores of a further recom pence, I meane the Croune of Media it selfe, but how? not by base relaxation and accordance to their wills, but by our owne vallutes, and preuailing excursions, pressing now forward, as if a Tree cutt to the heart and hanging by a small hold were with a strong push to ridd the workman of m

Then Astiages replyed, the Honor of a King was more then a

Million of liues, and the Gods had appointed them their vicegerents, sometime like good stewards to husband their plenty &amp; encrease their inheritance, sometimes like seuere Maisters to correct offenders and to be the scourges of Iuorath: howsoeuer, he would not remaine ouerinsulted by the wrong of an other, but be famous in after ages for some exployte of his owne: They againe inferred that contentions arose from prestigious spirits which delighted in the blood of men, that their late scares of desolation and aduersitie were not yet worne out, that plentie like an Orphan went mourning in the streetes, and that his election to the Diadem challenged no such bondage at their hands, because they well hoped in his conformity to good purpose, and had

                     ORmisdates not long since King of Persia, 
                     The story of Ormisdates and Damafloris. hauing matched with Garifeola, Artabanus Otanes Mother of Media matched her likewise with Noblenesse of birth and minde, and by reason of their loues, the Kingdome like a well manured Ground, brought foorth encrease

of much happinesse, to the inestimable enriching of the possessor: For although the Queene was barren of her body, yet her inward excellencies so flourished, that they added life to good conceite toward her; and indeed moderated to the admiration of diuers, and the honor of the King, that wanton libertie, which such a Prince in enioying many concubines, presumeth on. But the oldest Wood doth soonest burne, and Ormisdates in his declining age was soonest allured to lust-breaking faith, and did degenerate from himselfe, I meane stood not so strongly on his Guard of vertue, when there was expectation of setled humours, as in the heate of youth when the errors of life might haue passed with excuse: For as he passed through the streetes of Magranopolis to cellebrate the feast of the Sunne, he cast his eyes vpon a window, wherein a Lady (at left her outward shew bare the same record) sate with a countenance compounded of cheerefull affabillity, and louely modesty, little thinking, that cunning had taught her eyes both to allure, and draw compassion, that experience had brought her countenance to the vse of many changes, that necessitie had made her tongue deny, where she wished, and demaund, where she knew there was nodeniall; that time had wrought her heart sometime like waxe to melt with the warmth of desier; sometime like stone to be hardned with disdaine: &amp; that coustome had custructed her demeanor Matronlike, if there

were occasions of sobrietie: Courtlike, if great estates importuned, and fantastique, if there were inducements of wantonnesse.
                  This was Damastoris, a woman of reasonable good Parentage, of reasonable good yeares, of reasonable good estate, a Widdow childles, and wealthy, two helpes in all conditions and Common-wealths; and a wanton taking the benefite of her time: and belike finding inconuenience in the obedience of one man, would not so subiect her youth and liberty any more; whereupon shee made vse of her experience, and indeed ouerliberally satisfied her pleasure: Yet with that delicate conueyance, that the fault seldome appeared; and if it did, could not be vrged against her. With her Ormisdates fell in loue, or at least in such liking, that hee perswaded him selfe it was loue, and so determined to perswade her: this yet was the doubt, the meanes of accesse, hee not able to come to her without speciall notice taken, and for speciall purpose; shee not likely to come to him, neither willing to attende in Court, nor hauing cause of Petition or complaint: At last Desire bred Imagination, Imagination Conceit, Conceit some Disquiet, and Disquiet must needes haue Redresse: Now when Princes come to seeke Redresse, I hope no man will imagine, that any worldly meanes can be wanting; and when the King of Persia importuned dispatch; who would not? nay, who did not endeuour to please and to pleasure him? yet heerein

hee onely imployed Pasquito, a man of reasonable comelinesse, exceeding good behauiour, dellicate ellocution, setled experience, (as hauing all his time like a cunning Marchant, seene many Countries, and neuer daring to venture his Wealth in one Shippe) and honourable secrecie, such a quallytie that somtimes all other good partes fayling it simplie preuayleth: who at the first, pleaded many excuses to the King, of disgrace in the action, hassard of preuayling, &amp; so incurring his displeasure, danger of temptation, ielosies, mistrustes, and the cunning of Women: At last the king commaunding, or he being willing to obey, Pasquito furnished him selfe, and came to Damafloris with all the graces of a Princes solicitor: first beginning with her owne worth, that shee did Beautie wrong, to keepe it like a Flower in a close Potte, making no vse either to please the scent, or the sight: that shee was a present for a mighty King (and peraduenture a King indeed did like her. (This hee sayd, to make her inquisitiue, knowing Women were subiect to curiositie) that he had heard and knew shee was Wise, and therefore would not refuse the fortune was toward her; and that hee came from Ormisdates, who wished well vnto her, and had sent a Present of kindnesse by him; so that if hee were not an vnworthy Messenger, and a man hatefull, it could not choose, but shee must apprehend the blessing ment. This was vttered in so good a fashion, that though shee had knowne, how to haue reprooued Incontinencie, yet could shee not

much mislike him, that did but his dutie to his Prince; nor the King, that offered fauour to his Subiect; nor her selfe, for beeing solicited by the mighty Ormisdates: But with a kind of abasshed drawing backe, rather studying to contriue her businesse to the best purpose, then willing to entertaine any cause of mislike, shee yet made him beleeue, there was cause of mislike, saying, (and almost weeping in so saying) that the King wronged her much, to suppose shee would make sale of her Chastity; that hee wronged her more so to motion her dishonour, hauing neither seene nor heard any tokens by her of immodesty. All this, sayd Pasquito, is confessed: yet, quoth hee, the loue of a King is of that prerogatiue, that hee protested, it was more for her owne sake, then the Kings satisfaction hee came thither; and so by degrees of insinuation, fell to appeasing her; from appeasing to perswading, from perswading to counsayling, that howsoeuer she determined (which sayth he, I will not vrge further against your vertuous resolutio) it were not amisse to speake with the King. Heere shee stopped againe, falling to the examination of particulars, how, when, and where, the King should take notice of her? All which, he certified with excellent circumstances. Then she made many doubts of the Queenes ielousie, the Courts opinion, and her owne iourney. Nay, sayth hee, if you vouchsafe me the Author of this good Newes to my Prince, neither Queene, Court, nor your

selfe, shall know your selfe, or once haue cause to entertaine the attributes of Ielosie. Thus it was concluded, that shee should bee disguised like a Marchant of Arabia, and so vnder colour of the sale of rich Iewels haue secret conference with Ormisdates, and this she did with that gallant demeanor and attractiue, that the King was rather rauished then

But when Artabanus Otanes her Sonne vnderstood of these proceedings, the indignitie was too hainous to tollerate, and the reuenge too difficult to attempt: yet something must be done to keepe his Honour intigrate, and his Mother from so strange infamie; wherupon without further ambagie, finding himselfe vncapable of the Scepter, by reason that the Lawes of Persia debarred a Stranger (which yet they afterward went about to disanull) and vnable to make a conquest in regard of home incumbrances, hee determined to cast it on some other, whose

of his apprehention, which consorted to his wish: For Tautaxes ambitious enough of himselfe was willing to be thought worthy to be a Prince, not remembring the danger of that point, but now incited by such liklyhoodes, he gathered his forces and friendes togeather, sending Artabanus word, that if he would come in person (because he would haue the name of a King and credite to the action) there should not any oare want to

                  Now was Damafloris sole Queene, and with her cunning and authoritie, handled her businesse so well▪ that by aduancing of some, bestowing of Offices on others, placing reconsiled Friends (least farre off they might prooue dangerous Enemies) neerest her seate, and forbearing a time the vsuall impositions of the Kingdome, her former errour was forgotten, and they were contented to admit of her Sonne Ascrasapes for King; who by this time was able to conceiue of matters of gouernment; and seeing the miseries which the Warres had in a manner deuasted all the Kingdome with, pollitickly matched with Mitrea the Daughter of Tautaxes slaine by his Vnckle; hoping by vniting both the Families togeather, to leaue no scruple nor doubt for his succession.

First then, the remembrance of her Father helped forward her hate against Damafloris; and that ended not without effects, and they procured Ascrasapes to depose her from her regencie, by suggesting a conference happening betweene the Mother and Sonne, wherein shee dared to tell him, hee must respect her as principall cause of his Honour, and that hee was tyed in a kind of duty toward her, for aduancing him in this sort. Little needed the Spurre to a forward Horse; little needed Mitrea to vrge this against her, because hee tooke it in ill part, and the Sonne of such a woman had malice enough in store; which according to the Queenes owne desire, made his Will stand for a Law against both his Mother and her partakers. The second attempt was against the King himselfe; for finding her heart to stomacke shee was matched with a Bastard, for whose sake her Father was slaine; and her selfe more in pollecie, then honour and loue thus confirmed, shee cared not what troubles were procured, or mischiefe might settle her minde; so that after many circumstances, Ascrasapes died, not without suspition of poyson, and shee in her Pha

But the Noble men of Persia casting vp the account of these strange distractions of the Common-wealth, thought by taking away the cause to remooue the effects; and by quite abolishing the race of Ormisdates, (especially the ofspring of Damafloris) and some what fearing the violent humour of the Queene Mitrea, determine for another King, and looking toward Artabanus of Medea, as well for his owne worth, as his Grandmothers sake, and Fathers losse; who though he perished not in the Fieldes of Persia, yet by his beeing heere, his troubles in Media were occasioned, nominated him to the place, and sent accordingly to bid him prouide for all their goods: Yet by the good behauiour of Mitrea, was this iudgement reuersed, and Astiages her Sonne appearing with some towardlinesse, made them repeale the former Edict, as it were pittying his youth, and that hee deserued no such punishment; but indeed the desire of satisfaction toward the noble house of Tautaxes bound in their duty and obedience with stricter obseruation: So they all submitted to Astiages, and misfortune weary of tartying long in Persia, passed into Media, as you haue heard: in which time the Kingdome of Astiages recouered some part of her former glory, vntill Artabanus tooke vpon him the burden of being wronged, and so lay in waite for reuenge; which hee went about, but was frustrated by his forces defeature vnder the leading of

For pleasure vsed with extremytie looseth her sweetnesse, and best propertie: therfore let vs first diue and remember the Ladyes, as well loue exercise, as discourses; and yet the hearing of other mens matters doth little touch their owne prayses: so that day passed with the varietie of Courtly pastimes, and the next with the flying of Hawkes, the third with hunting, and the fourth made the time seeme very long, had not the company entreated Sacromirus to finish Anzitemus story: who thus began.
                  AFter Aistages was in in a manner restarined Sacromirus sonne of Hircania proceedeth with Artabanus historie. by the wisdome of his Councell: he yet most ingenerously scorned to be so courbed of his will, and enraged, put in execution a terrible reuenge, imprisoning Mulcasses against the Law of Armes, and surprising Adelphus against the Law of honestie: within the time of truce gathering his Armie togeather, and one night came vpon him vnprouided, he yet vsed the aduantage of his Trenches, and some streight passages he had

fortunately Barrocaded: But alasse this rather sharpned, then rebated their courage; So by reason of ouernumber and home assisted, they quickly made a breach into the Campe, and Triumphed with a notable slaughter: Adelpbus dangerously wounded, and hardly escaping to be the messenger of more harder tidinges.
                  When Artabanus saw him selfe thus subiect to the mallice of fortune, and that he resembled a man, who once stumbling neuer left reeling, till he came to the ground, or one whom shrewd Turnes, (as it were in sequence) followed after one another: his modest anger could not refraine from inuection, and pashionat complainning against his Fortune: But when Anzitemus stomached the dishonor, because his Councell consorted The story of Anzitemus and Astiages. not with successe, and that he saw a further procrastination of his businesse, little needed Arttabanus to trouble conceite, how to winde vp the Wheeles of this engine: For he importuned the iorney in person, and opposed against the difficulties obiected: Wherupon the Magi and Haruspices were commaunded to attend, who by their sacrifices deuined the greatest and happyest euent, and Anzitemus with a well prouided and sufficient Armie passed through all the borders of Persia, possessing the strongest holds, and after in three encounters preuayled against Astiages, enforcing his retreate to the strong Towne of Susiania, where the place almost impregnable made him lye a while houering

                        
like a skilfull Faulken, that with aduantage he might sease on his prey.
                  
                  
                     By this time had report added much to his glory; and that made the comparison betweene his true vertue and Astiages ill disposition stand him in great stead. For when vntoward remembrance had layed open the recordes of all their strange accidents, which turmoyled Persia, they reckoned themselues in the rancke of vnhappy subiects vnder an vnhappy King, the rather for that the Royall Anzitemus came orderly to demaund Mulcasses deliuery, and to propound the former articles of peace vnto them by the Maryage of Roxana to Darius Artabanus sonne, and so to dismisse Astiages murdreth Mulcasses. his Armie. But the disloyall Astiages not only entreated him with scorne, but barborously murdedred Mulcasses, &amp; like a Monster in nature, brought him in seuerall Dishes dismembred before them all: and thus with a violent gesture, vngorged his mallice. Why base fugitiue? Art not thou the wretched sonne of a more wretched Father, whom his Country scorned, and people exiled? what monstrous presumption hath besotted thee to terrefie Persia with wonder-making deuises, as if I were an infant vnder a foolish Mother to be beaten with a Rod, and appeased with a trifell? Or dost thou suppose with thy vntoward proceedinges, by the helpe of my owne subiects, Traytors to our God' and me, to affright or dismay Astiages, who if the worst fault will teare out his

heart, and throw it in thy face? thou art deceiued, Vacabond as thou art: yet because you counterfeite a kinde of embassage, your iorney shall not altogeather be frustraite; heere is Mulcasses; here is Astiages that brought him; and heere is the contempt of Armenias power, and Artabanus, that sent him: Thus is your farewell concluded, vnlesse you meane to supply the defects of my entertainment with this cheare.
                  But what cheare could the vncheered company make; when the hideous spectacle daunted the stoutest courage? or what answere might they frame, that knew not how to speake, because they could not; nor could, because they durst not; nor durst, being so appauled? the company of his owne obedience strangely altered, and the rest sooner altred, as hauing no cause to obey: yet doe not imagine they sate long to behold, or durst, as they sate, behold so vilde a sight: But rising in a mutinous turmoyle, spent the shortest time in exclamation, &amp; offerd such violence, as the place and number permitted: but in vaine doe they attempt further, for feare, and shame; or shamefull feare hath caried his hatfull body into some remoat corner, where affraide to see the mishappen deformitie of his minde, he smothered all the motions of reformation with a working conceite of more mischeife.
                  By this time is the Cittie in Armes, as terrefied with a suspition of their owne ruine, and most of

BVt by that time the next morning had wiped Astiages desperate of recouery, considering Anzitemus possessed his Kingdome, flyeth to Cleonidas. away the dolefulnesse of the night, a new Alarum raysed the Armie, and disturbed them all: For Astiages certified of this disaster, wherein his wilfulnesse had entoyled him, and how hee was in a manner caged vp within his owne Cittie, of which before his eyes a Stranger had the possession, tooke it so ill at Fortunes hands, that all enraged, hee thus encouraged his fauourites.
                  
                     Oh (sayth hee) there is no trusting to any place wee haue wronged; besides, our prouision cannot long last, though the Hold (as wee may fortefie it) seeme impregnable, and to driue you to vnpreuentable mischiefes when the enemie will increase, as well in number as in Pride; and former disgraces set other on worke to reuenge, is that I may not, nor will not suffer. Let vs therefore now set vpon them, as they are debating the matter, and by fyering the Citie, wee shall draw the most of them to looke to their priuate and so in not preuayling, preuaile to make our escape in the hurliburly: For the rest, let the changes of time determine, as they may. These speaches, and the performance, had but one hower: for his Souldiers with Firebrands in their hands, came running through the streetes, killing all they met, and casting them into euery house they could enter, and although the necessitie of their businesse proiected only escape for Astiages: yet as if they had been to Sacke the place, the miseries of such change succeeded,

murdring all sortes without difference of sexe or age, pillaging, taking of prisoners, rauishing of women, and mingling a cruell victory and dissolute pleasure together, till Anzitemus ouertooke them Whirling downe the streete to the water-gate, wheresome forces had intercepted their passage, whereby an equall mett manhood grew to the greater proufe, when the streightnesse of the place compelled to fight or defence, and Astiages played his part so well, that all men had him in admiration. For the troopes were weakned, the arayes broken, the assailants slaine, the retierers dismembred, and this new feare bread new confusion: But when Anzitemus had resembled him to a rauenous Mas

                     e in a hunger starued night, who carlesse of the owners welfayre breaketh into a company of sheepe, mangling more with the chase, then necessitie, he pressed neerer to single him out, and his modest anger could not refraine from thus reprehending him. Oh insatiate homicide! What Tiger cherished thy infancie? or didst thou sucke the Teares of crueltie, that thou scornest all vertue, humanytie▪ and true manhood: and soothest each venemous motion with a false obedience to stubborne will; surely the Gods are not such as our reuerence adore; If this impietie haue with her spring alike repining Harnest; Nor are men worthy the earths encrease, if they suffer this outrage, and let Anzitemus be for euer defamed; if he endeuour not to

punish such a wretch. But when Astiages heard the name of Anzitemus, and knew that this was hee, which entred his Realme, with-drew his Subiectes from him, tooke his Townes, was novv Maister of the Citie, and had driuen him to these streightes; the outward franticknesse proceeding from inward distemperature, beat the Earth, gnashed his Teeth, and bitt the very Corselet hee wore: Yea the rage changed his countenance to a duskish blacknesse; which shewing the strange effect of hate opened the ioynts, whereby the veines spurted out their fulnesse; and not able to proceed any further, then oh yee infernall powers; hee made his Sword the Hearald of a dangerous Defiance, whose force tryed, whether Anzitemus strength could abide it falling, or courage vphold him selfe staggering, the standers by imputing it both to Cunning and Fortitude, that that one blow had not finished the tryall: Now was Anzitemus put to the pollicie of an out-facing retreat, not in any diffidence of the Combat, but in hope of better aduantage: For perceiuing his Aduersary bent to ouermaister him, with actiue warinesse he bare off the burden of infinite strokes; but finding at last, the Tirant wearied with making too much haste, and that his Strength beeing spent, his Furie passed with a kind of slacknesse, hee aduanced him selfe; and rebuking Shame encreased his courage, that Astiages might not auoide vnlacing his Armes, deuiding his Shield, nor

                        
wounding his Body. And thus haue I seene a new made Fire tarry a while, vntill heate had dryed the moysture of the Fuell, and then in a sodaine flame to make reflexion of greater warmth: yet was Astiages loth to discouer either disabillytie or suspition, but striuing with an excellent courage, made it a perilous fight, and the perill bade them beware of the effectes, which was vtter destruction. And as when two mightie Lyons hauing both their Females in necessitie of food, hapning at an instant on a little pray fall at such variance, that the scorne of distribution settleth them to besatisfied in the bloud one of another: So these as mightie combatanta not acknowledging the least difference, determine, that life shall depart, before Honour be subiect to disgrace, wherby the strangnesse wrought an amase, and the manner a kind of delight. For they taking vp the narrow Rome of the streete, the rest had libertie to breath as if they seemed weary in the Butchering one of another, and apprehended the end of all their troubles in the end of this controuersie: But Astiages seeing no hope of the conquest, and beginning to misdoubt him selfe, fell backe againe to his first resosution of escape, and remembring his League with Cleonidas, thought there was possibilitie to returne with sufficient Fortune and Reuenge, if hee could get thither by any meanes: Whereupon, lifting vp the fayling legges of Courage with all the remainder of a worne-out Furie, he whirled

at the turning head of his aduersary a blow of too great perill, had not his eyes twinckling at the brandishing of the weapon, been a caueate to other motiones, wherby a sudden starting made his right foote slip, and the earth yeeld, so that thinking to giue forward, the body measured the ground with his length; which Astiagas tooke Astiages flyeth to his Ships. hold of, and by crying Auzitemus was slaine, in despight of opposition made for the time a fortunate escape, euery one confounded with the sorrowfull newes, and hindering one another with a rumerous entercourse: But their feare and griefe with a chearefull contrarietie is soone reuersed by the vprysing of Anzitemus, and although they could not satisfie him with reuenge on the person of the King; yet did they recompence him with the gift of the Kingdome, and with Panegericall ceremonies conducted him to the Pallace, not doubting, but as the Beare displeased with natures deformity by often licking fashioneth her young ones to an appointed shape: So would he deale with their dissolute Common wealth, and reforme what had misled the company amisse.
                  But because I haue brought him to so good lodging, and that he found the beautifull Roxana there, I will qustionlesse leaue him, as vnwilling to enter into vnfortunate discourses, either concerning himselfe and father: or touching Brizaca who might be suspitious to heate Roxana named. Nay (qouth Trezoboro in his Sisters behalfe) things

past are past care, &amp; therfore I dare auouch Brizacas content shal consist in Anzitemus future respect, but they I perswade my selfe, will well agree. So shall we neuer (replyed king zalby) vnlesse we be thankefull to the Prince for his discourse, and entreate the gratious Brizaca once againe to impose this taske on Anzitemus, For I proteste, I long to heare, by what chaunce the director of all chaunces hath consented, that this meeting should be recorded in the volumes of admiration. But Rugio sayd, there was no reason in the suddennesse: For he had a purpose to shew the Princes the Arbour, which King zalby so much liked, and they after they liked, so much commended: in this taking the benefite of the next sunnes aduancement: the Feast was prepared, but till it please them to rise from their solemnytie, I dare not begin to trouble you with the discourse.

                     Your Honors humbled in all impositions:

                     To this, or the like purpose, did my speeches tend, whereby I somewhat pacefied the first enforcement;

but had a sparing answere concerning Roxana: For there wanted not those, which replyed, how her beautie and desert merited better at my hands, then so slightly to interest another with the possession of such life, and excellency; wherupon Zaleppo a cheife peere of the Realme, either stomaching my carelesenesse, or yet making me beleeue I should not leaue them so vnprouided, hasted to the Pallace; and returned with the Lady, as if he ment to exprobrate my simplycitie, that would ouerpasse a matter of such worth; and truely (most gratious Brizaca) such was the goodlynesse of her person, and the appearance of other perfections, that an exact amorist would not haue wished for better becomming: To be plaine, deuine, influence ouerruleth mans purposes; For what a continuall presence might haue wrought, I know not; but Fortune euer Ominous vnto me, (except in my now happines) intercepted this progresse of affection, and by the returne of Astiages with that Monster of nature Cleonidas, whom I shall neuer name with patience, ouerturned both the foundation and the building of my desires.
                  For Astiages stomaching the indignitie of the Astiages returneth with Cleonidas who brought Artabazes into Persia. reuolt and his owne discomfiture, presently fled to his ships (as he had before contriued) and putting into the maine Caspian the next day encountred with this damnable associate; betweene Whom for the time passed some difference, the

one impeaching delay, wherby mischance Triumphed to his great discomforte: the other, excusing the matter by the Battaile with my father, and that he also heard Adelphus was returned into Media, which offered him leisure to the new rigging his ships and supplying his men: but when Cleonidas had fully conceiued the desaster of Astiages, he bad him quiet himselfe, and infused new life with the sight of Artabazes in Captyuitie, which the King tooke so passhionately that he confounded two contraries, ioy and anger togeather: For neither remembring his vertues, nor greatnesse, nor allowing the present magnanimity outfacing his misery, with a sullen abruptnesse he plainely tould him, that if at the first motion I did not deliuer vp the possession of Susiana, and depart quietly out of Persia: he would Torture him before my face in view of the Cittie: in which humour they Landed their Armie, and Soldierlike marched forward, surprising many places I had forrefied, till a timely alarum gaue notice of their pretences, and occationed expedition to intercept them.
                  But to decipher the variety of humours, which the accident wrought, were to be as tedious now, as they were troublesome then: Some vnder Colour of remorse began to vpbraied their disobedience, that so soone consented to the deposing of a King for a casuall effect of distemprature: some ignominiously cowards began already to prepare for a flight, and these the only bosters in security:

Some absolutely wicked respecting nothing but themselues, made a continuall reuoult to the stronger side, a polliticke preuention of their losses, though the obloquie remained: some with a kind of cunning spared both a reprehention of the enemie, and palpable flattery of the preuayler: some stomached the deiection of their houses, as rather wishing their owne aduancements, then repining at my successe: some neither hopefull to others, nor helpefull to themselues, onely wondred, that Persia should be so barren to elect a stranger ouer them; these men had willingnesse, but no power to doe hurt; some true Louers of the Common-wealth proclaimed mee Protector of the Realme, and maintained the charge of the Warre with their owne, and the Citties Treasure.
                  Now was I some what perplexed to be resident amongst so many vnstayed dispositions: yet vnwilling to receiue notice of euery slender occation, I applyed my selfe to the time, taking a generall Oth of the Cittie, wherein I reserued the hostages of diuers Noble men: besides Roxana remained as a pledge for my securytie, and seemed contented, so her fathers life might be spared: but not

                  Now had I time to condemne the trechery, suspect some plot of mischiefe, blame the vnable companie to intercept him, exclaime on the cowardice of the Souldiers, and make faultie I knew not whom, or what: Yet at last, Aduice recalled mee to suppose, that deferring would occasion him to be the better prouided; and if hee once escaped, to bee setled in his strength; it would prooue an aduenture of more danger and difficultie to disseise him: I therefore allowed Direction no further scope, but made after with all speede, and embarked in the rest of Cleonidas owne Ships, which we enforced to serue our turne: But by that time extremitie was a little moderated, I began to cast many doubts, as how Cleonidas was attended, which way his resolution accelerated, and whether our owne company were sure to vs or no. These particulars by examining the Mariners, and some others attending in the Shippes, were soone answered, that Cleonidas had eight Shippes, and would with out doubt, make toward the dry Iland. Other questions were of lesse importance, and yet expected their solutions: so wee cast many of them ouer board, lerning as few to consume or hinder (as wee could) and seeing wee possessed twelue, nothing was thought on, but a fortunate encounter; which ere the next Sunne had mounted to the height of his maiestie, bade vs bee our

owne Iudges of: for wee ouertooke the Pirate, who mistaking vs for his owne Company, somewhat slacked the winde, and in a manner taried our approach.

Heauen, Farth, and Sea, storming at the accident, as though hee had been betrayed to destruction, which almost made him open the dore to death with his owne hands: yet beeing remembred by some one better considerat of the many changes depending on the actions of men, hee recalled both Iudgement and Courage, and began the fight in such manner, as you see a Feast marshalled to make the statelyer shew by good order: For our losses were equall a long time; and as a man fell amongst them, another dropped amongst vs: as their Slinges and Arrowes endamaged vs, our Stones and Engines slaughtered them: as their Fire-workes were throwne with effect, ours were not cast without proofe; at last, the smallest Barckes felt the i

guest comming both vnlookt-for, and vnbidden, approched to disappoynt vs, and made vs enforce our selues seeming most brauest, when wee could least hurt; and in the end of our furie beginning a new worke of woefulnesse. But Cleonidas 
                     Cleonidas and Anzitemns fight at Sea as in the beginnig. either of despayring the euent, or loth to disproportion his tyranous minde, euen when Death seemed weary, commaunded to set fire of all, and heaw the Shippes in peeces; whereupon followed so lamentable a Catastrophe, as I thought no man happy, but such whom death had absented from the vnhappinesse, which many howers continued in pittifull cryes, and heart-renting exclamations; nor wanted there horrible scriches, and execrable Apostacy. To this the fire added a woonderfull terrour, appearing as if it determined to quench the Ocean; but most aptly I thought it a pollecie of Destruction, to light vs to Hell. And truly (my most gracious Brizaca,) though now dearer to mee, then my dearest life, yet were I not sure of the felicity collated by your selfe, I would not againe behold such another Stratagem, no not in hope of an other Brizaca: For I am certaine not foure men liued, though none escaped what was ten times worse then death; and how some deuine influence ouerlooked me, I know not; but I well remember, vnlesse I should haue haled death with my ownehands, it could come no faster toward mee: Yet it was my chaunce to light on a broken peece of Cleonidas owne Ship, hauing no

other comfort, then in the meditation of my last end, resoluing neuer to pollute my then cleane thoughts with any dregs of worldly compounds. In this manner Placandus sounde mee, and within a while againe I lost my selfe: but how that recouery chanced beyonde my desert, you can best tell, that haue payde the ransome of my redemption.
                  Now by the blessed escape of those dangers, I sweare (quoth Brizaca) you haue affrighted mee with this Discourse; But seeing it is your pleasure to take hold of a new Comfort, and suppose mee the Antidote of these greeuances: Let your Hopes be neuer interdicted; and cursed be the occasion of infringing our desires: which was vttered with such vehemency, as if true Loue determined to tell the passengers, heere was his Mansion: For the teares distilled from her eyes, as if the hart melting within had sought out a passage for the moysture: So haue I seene thee sweete Rose leaues quickly couered with a Still, and feeling a change by the working heate, drop out his dellicate sauour amongst vs. When Anzitemus saw those excellent Lampes filled so vnkindly, hee stepped vnto her, and meant to dry them with his kisses: but not preuayling, he put his owne vpon them like Spunges to soake them vp.
                  While this extasie continued, diuers matters were debated betwixt the King and the other Princes, who well pleased in Anzitemus discouerie,

&amp; transported to the admiration of his Vertues by considering his worth, presently made offer of them selues and powers, to the effecting whatsoeuer was expedite for his Honour. Yet (quoth Trezoboro) seeing Cleonidas hath commenced so often vntoward occasion of remembrance, let vs exact of your kindnesse a relation of his estate and condition. What can I deny such desert? (answered Anzitemus) and though you haue taxed mee with a dangerous imposition, as that I must aggrauate my sorrow with the repetition of the cause, and awake Impartialitie to say the truth of my Enemie: yet doe I well vouchsafe to be thus his Historiographer.
                  AFter the aged Sagarenus of Thessaly was The story of Cleonidas and Antanata: with Armenus takeing her part possessing the Kingdome and denominating the Country. made acquainted with the honourable expedition of the Iouialists to Taurica, (where Dianas siluer Tree exposed such honour and reward in the atcheeuement) in manner of a fatherly exhortation he counselled his sonne Armenus to make tryall of Fortunes curtesie amongst the rest, who more forward, then fortunate prepared for the iorney, and was enrowled amongst the other Princes to accompany Telpinas (whom the casting of Lotts had made their Captiane in the enterprise:) Now by that time the Soldiers had taken possession of the Harbour, and Telpinas was newly setled in Cherona aduising how

to proceed: Artaxata a Queene extract from the greatest bloud of Cilitia and the spatious Countryes vnder the Mount Taurus, came in person to the Court, where this Noble assemblie kept residence, and had by this time filled all Asia with wonder at the attempt:) and like a Prince in whom a magnanimous Countenance seemed the Ornament of an Heroijcke spirit with her associat affabillitie, neither manlike, nor effeminate thus excused her selfe.
                  
                     I am come to thee (thou Honorable Grecian) induced, as much by the hope of thy vertues, as fame of thy actions: For this is subiect to alteration by the reporters partiallytie: that remaineth like a squared die euery way cast standing vpright, I will therfore firme this Anchor on the sufficiency therof, not doubting but to moue some spirit to add to his owne Honor and my glory, when he shall vnderstand a woman, a Virginn, a Queene, is wronged and in distresse: For true Nobillity is decipherd in those famous exploites of releefe, not in vaine ostentation or enticementes of ambytion: So long then hath my fathers house continued in prosperitie, that either the Godes enuied our established mightynesse, or Fortune (stomaching the razing and subuertion of Colosseum a Temple once dedicated to her) consented to haue this neglect or rather contempt punished, and performed it with the indignytie of a Trayterous reuolt, at such a time, as when Maiestie

scorned the presumption of a Subiect, and Loue fled from an vnkind Compulsion: For no sooner was my Fathers Exequies celebrated, but my estate bade mee step into the Chaire of Controulment, wherein I prepared to sit with the applause of all my Subiectes, had not Cleonidas, an ancient enemie to the peace of many Prouinces, perswaded an inuiolate perpetuity, if I would admit of his loue, which (as he sayd) proceeded from the fountaine of true Desire, and acknowledging my Vertues: But I tooke it otherwise; that the greedinesse of Ambition had taught him a polliticke lesson of passhion, and rather hasted him to counterfeit his liking; which made mee impugne the forwardnes, and not without some tearmes of reprehention (yet farre from reproch) dismissed him, as if I expected a further corroboration of my estate. At last vrged againe with a kind of presumption, or rather carelesnesse of my Royaltie, in a quiet manner of disdayne I assured him, I neither feared his Mallice, nor regarded his Fauour; but in despight of Confederats, would haue him an exemplary obedience to the rest of my Subiects.
                  
                  
                     This he tooke in great reproch, and soone made  apparant the Barrennesse of the ground, wherin the Seedes of his loue were set: For vnder Colour Cleonidas conderateh with Colphurnus a Gyant, of indignitie to the Realme, that such a iurisdiction, and so many worthy men should betyed to the wilfulnesse of a woman, he raysed a dangerous

                        
faction against me, and for the better countenancing his Treasons seduced, and with great summes of Mony hired Colphurnus the Giant of Taurus to be his Colleauge: a man or rather a monster respecting nothing but disorder, and louing no creature saue himselfe: a man neuer terrefied with prodegies, allowing religion and conscience but a pollycie to restraine the forwardnesse of some brauely disposed: a man implacable in his furie, and ouer insulting if chance or mischance afforded him superiorytie: To conclude, such a one, as scorned my simplicity, and mocked Cleonidas ambytion: yet gaue winges to this attempt, rather that his owne greatnesse might appeare, then for any willingnesse to assist the other. Thus in ouerdaring manner they came once againe to demaund my consent, which I protest I now reserued more charylie, and reiected him as rediculous, to see a man professe kindnesse, and expresse hate, sue for fauour, and threaten despight: wish peace, and procure Warre: propose goodnesse, and dispose mischiefe: plead for remorse, and determine reuenge, vsing me as some in-descreete fathers their Children, who many times beat them without cause, alleadging Conscience, and the necessity of correction: But when Colphurnus heard my deniall, (onely maligning that his presence wrought no better with mee) hee stormed beyonde all the limits of reason, and rayled at mee, as if the name of a Queene had neuer been heard of: which

though I was not so happy to preuent, yet was 
                           〈◊〉
                         so bold to disclayme. Proud beast (sayd I) whom the Heauens haue excluded, and the Earth supposeth burdensome, though thy Senses neuer participated any ciuill sound, and the name of Vertue had onely the estimation of such a word; yet how durst thou neglect the due regard to a Prince, which the vnreasonable creatures in their kinde fulfill? But seeing Nature sometimes yeeldeth to Errours, that the perfect may be discerned by the vnperfect, I allow thee a Monster amongst Men; and yet resolue, neither shall thy body escape vnpunished, nor thy soule (if I may suppose it in such deformity) vnpardoned. Thinke (honourable Lords) this much impeached his patience, and hasted them to trifle no longer; whereupon they spoyled my people, depopulated the Country, subuerted my Townes, and weakned my Forces; which with my owne person, they had vtterly defeated, had I not tooke aduantage of the strength of a Castle, wherein I remaine at this instant besieged; and vnlesse some fortunate Aspect doe heere looke vpon mee, I must submit to the vntowardnesse of a heart-vexing necessitie, (as for the place, I suppose it for a time impregnable in the continuance of their loyalties possessing it,) and not without some strange stratagem, or surrender to be quickly commaunded. Now suppose much more might haue been spoken, and much better: but if I be vnderstood, I am satisfied; and if assisted,

comforted otherwise.
                  
                  Nay (quoth the Heroijck Armenus) by your Armenus Sonne of Sagarenus assisteth the Queene Artaxata. patience Royall Queene no more; and their Lordly leaues no lesse? then what soeuer the Gods haue imparted vnto me, to prostrate it before you; if then you dare commit so priselesse a Iewell to so slender a Guard, my fayth and endeauors shall surpasse outward meanes, and yet I make no doubte the Iustice of your cause, and the trophe of my reward shall incite me to effectuate any exployte within the reach of performance, so that if euer action were attempted for reasons sake, heere is reason vpon reason, and he an vnreasonable coward, that dare not make so honorable a progression: By this time her countenance was inuested with a new forme, and her gallant demeanot bred a desier in the rest to send fame on their Errands: But Artaxata vrged no further, nor troubled Telpinas with other importunitie, more then that she gratified him for his vertuous kindnesse and care for alotting a reasonable company to attend her, and sending a Messenger into Thessaly, to acquaint the aged Sagarenus with his sonns fortune.
                  In this Iollytie made Artaxata her returne, and because some questions may be enforced, concerning the Iorny, let me answere; such was her imparadised beautie, attractiue comlinesse, gallant youth, sweete demeanor, and all gracing vertues that he seemed rather rauished, then enamored:

such againe was his seemly person, firmnesse of manhood, portly behauiour, delightsome countenance, &amp; all helping Courage, that she remained rather ouercome, then pleased: So that with thankesgining to the Gods for this happy acquaintance, and seemely desires to be acceptable one to another; they concluded the Sunpathy of conditions and liking, should tye the indissoluble knot of Armenus &amp; Artaxata contract. affection: yet left he not thus, but with a serious enquiry of her affayres made way to better conceite of his wisedome: Wherupon she acqainted him with the peoples liberty, and the seeldome matched obedience in the libertie: the factions amongst the better sort, the alliance and priuiledges of her owne family, the manner of her fathers gouernment, and lastly made a distinction betweene men Enobled for the Court, and embled for the Common-wealth: she also imparted the abillity, state and conditions of Cleonidas, the beginning of his loue, and the proceeding of her troubles. But (quoth the respectiue Armenus) by what meanes escaped you the enemy in this flight, I will tell you that too, sayed the Queene.
                  After the report of your Greekish expedition had liberally acquainted vs with so many Princes, so many men of Vallure, as accompanyed Tlepinas in the enterprise, and were then resident in Taurica: one time amongst others, as I was obsequious in my sacrifice with many impetrations, that they might be propityatory, and many many

deuotions to expiate my offences, me thought the Penates beckned a silence, and bad me hast to Cherona for redresse, wherin sure they determined my deliuery, for though the time of the yeere almost warranted better weather, yet that night and all the next day fell such a Snow, as if the heauen ment to shew vs some varietie: now by reason of a vault letting in the Riuer to the vse of the pallace, I conceiued how to escape by couering my selfe and and some few others in whight Linnen, and trulie I will not now boast, but with an extraordinary life did I then passe vpon the Bancke, which the enemie had cast out of their trenches, at such time, as for very pittie they would not put foorth a Sentinell to watch, and so escaping to a place of more trust, then strength, I made such prouision as my hast permitted. But how now shall we enter (replyed Armenas.) As for that, (answered Artaxata) the Influence, which hath hetherto ouer ruled; will not leaue this worke imperfect. Now by the protection, which followes vs, you haue ouer reached me (sayed Armenus) in resolution, yet if it please you not to presage mee ill by feare or misdoubt, I haue thus deuised.
                  According to your description of Colphurnus, I geather his Courage and strength to be great, but his presumption and pride to be more, whrein such men goe forw ard in immanitie, not that they are vnuanquishable, but because opinions is terrefied

                        
with their hugenesse; and indeed resemble such Weedes, which while you handle daintily, will sting till you smart; but vse them with violence, they loose their force and efficasie. So that to offer priuate combate (which I am fure his insolency will rather deride, then reiect) may be the easiest course (though you may suspect not the safest) to reuerse your feares: For if I shrinke vnder the burden of a heauy disaster, perswade your self the old Sagarenus will draw all Greece to your ayde: or els your patience must proue an vnkind vertue: if I peruayle, what would you desire more; but that I should preuaile? Heere a still manner of behauiour continued awhile, but at last brake vp with a yeelding chearefulnesse: for it rather proceeded from the amasement at his Vertue, then despaire of the successe; and yet was there great disparitie betweene them. Thus they approched the Enemies Trenches, who euery day expected surrender, or composition; little suspecting that the Queene was absent, or that these new come troopes were worthy the name of a Supply; imputing it rather to their madnesse and folly, which would wilfully put them selues into danger without hope of recouery: Which when Armenus perceiued, and that they forbore violence against them, the next day like a Herrold of defiance; and yet summoning a Parlee, hee in this manner tryed their patience.

But why trifle I with circumstances? It is to thee Cleonidas I speake; it is against thee thou Tirant Colphurnus I enueigh: the one a wicked Rebell to Souerainty and Beauty; the other, a monstrous enemie to Maiestie and Vertue: and both as scandals and reproches to Vallour and Honour. Was it euer allowed, that a Subiect durst infringe the Lawes of Dutie and Alleagence against a Woman, a Virgin, a Queene? Was it euer heard, that a man of Vallour, durst offer violence (without impeachment of villany) to such a person, whose vertuous Renowne hath mooued the Heauens to pitty her, as though you had been framed to terrifie the world, and sent from Hell as Monsters in nature?

                  By this time Artaxata discouered her selfe, and

like the Sunne clearing the interposition of thicke Cloudes appeared the more glorious: so the Souldiers yeelded to mercy, and the people submitted as being before enforced; and because they would giue notice of their dutie for a beginning, with the same Water that draue the Mill, they drowned the Mill, quickly chasing Cleonidas in his retreat; Cleonidas prisoner and restored. and taking him by force, brought him bound to the Queene; who at Armenus intercession, gaue him life, liberty, and setled him in former estate, little suspecting, that courtesie to a Traytor, is a thankelesse office, and most commonly giueth but occasion of further hate and repining.

                  This had yeelded a full recompence indeed, if he could haue preuented a double mischance: The one in suffering Cleonidas the sonne to enioy his fathers bad conditions with his estate; the other in being deuided from his Royall Queene, whose life was now brought to an vntimely period by a heart vexing sicknesse; but heerein some supernaturall power wrought for the best, because now Childlesse, he after matched with Tolmiranda the Assirian Sophy, by whom he enioyed the fruites of his body in great towardlinesse, and continued the rest of his time in a gratious peace, had not time ripened the wicked disposition of Cleonidas the sonne, and hate as it were innated within him enforced many exorbitant actions, setting againe Cleonidas the Sonne is banished Armenia and becommeth a Piratte. the kingdome in combustion, which at last was better ordred and preuented.

                  These warres and Armenus life had end togeather, wherupon my father Artabazes began his Royall rase at such time, as this Cleonidas entertained a conceite of reuenge by this course of Piracie, wherein thirty yeares continuance made him an archmaster; and custome in wickednesse so blinded him, that great faults were reputed slender, and small ones not so much as imperfections: but the chiefest proppes too this wicked life; were the confederacie of many Princes, and his owne wealth vniustly amassed, with which in this latter time he maintained thirty well appointed Ships, and amongst other Stratagems (as you haue heard) was beholding to the warth full Nemesis for Artabazes losse, but whether deuine Iustice tooke my cause in hand, I know not.

Assure your selfe, that the Gods framing Man to A circumstantial commendation of pleasing conference. commaund all the Creatures vnder the Sunne, neither shuffled vp their workmanship, nor were so carelesse afterward, but with a great regarde sent him foorth to pubish their glory; and for that purpose gaue him prerogatiue of excellencie both in body and minde. This especially appeareth in your selues, to whom they haue vouchsafed deuotion, as finding time, and your owne vertues to perfect the worke, which they but began: And from hence proceedeth our resemblance of this outward substaunce, to a rich Treasure house made to secure more richer Wealth: Now, as Wealth is dispersed ouer the world to vse and good order, and without that lyeth hid like Earth within the ground: So your-selues are left in the world to comfort and benefit, according to the fortune of him, that possesseth you to happy purpose. Heere then resteth the cunning and grace, in the meanes of the seisure, which I auouch is first wrought by the instrument, the Tongue: For though some haue made a principle, that a womans Eye doth guide her witte, yet vnlesse occasion be offred to discouer the liking, what good can follow. But to speake more generally; Are not Presents, faire Entreaties, and the causes moouing Presents, prayers, praises winne women- (your deserts) which must be praysed, the ordinarie meanes of winning all women? And are not all these like dead Ashes without liuing conference, besides? the necessitie of conuersation, and

the true regard of Natures excellencies in you alloweth vertuous courses to obtaine your fauours; which howsoeuer is determined, is yet begun with protestation; and when it extendeth to great persons, compelleth a surther search, then in common Courses: For neuer was Misanthropos nor Tyrant so implacable, but beauty hath reduced: neuer was Beast so furious, but man hath tamed: Neuer was any thing so strong, but truth hath ouercome: and how? by reason and sweete enforcement.

But say there is inequallitie of persons, as many times it chanceth, (for Poets make loue blind,) I hope then the inferiour

person applaudeth his Fortune, and studieth with the helpes of art, nature, and industry to demeane himselfe.

Not vnlikely said Anzitemus, but because a villaine doth a mischeife with a Candell, shall we therfore vse no light? doe not so conclude: For I am resolued, that both contract of Maryage, and discouery of fancy are Dull enforcements without lybertie of speech, and ceremonious complement: therfore blame me not for praysing Roxana, and ratefying, she was a deseruer of all iustifiable desires: yet I protest the sorrow for her father, and her duety in the same, made me to study to pacefie her Corasiues, rather then display the Coulours of delight; and when I was vrged to solicite a new Course (which a messenger from Artabanus to please my selfe emboldned) thereturne of Astiages with Cleonidas quight diuerted me, and so I reassure you, she was vnacquainted with my

thoughts, and left to be a Lady of wonderfull expectation.

These poynts were mooued in the Senate of Fortona by Trachinus the Cittie Orator, whom Philano for that purpose had sent for, and had receiued his instructions to this end, to certifie the people, that though Anzitemus desert compelled the greatest regard; yet would not the Duke without their consent, so slightly part with so great a Summe out of the kingdome, as for the Leauge, wherby freendship and Traficke might encrease, he referred that to themselues: much time was not spent herein: For the Cittisenns enterpreting the motion to to proceed from the Dukes wisdome and loue were doubly drawne to consent, as well to remaine gratious to Rugio, as to seeme men of respect and

abillytie to Anzitemus: besides they offered a beneuolence toward the charges of this great entertainment (with such extremytie are they caryed, that neuer so little crossed in matters of wealth and superstition, they are hardly drawne without murmuringes to trifeles: againe quietly soothed with a meane allowance of libertie, they profusely offer their Mony, and applaud that, which otherwise they haue dared to contradict.)
                  Thus was Anzitemus supplied, and which prooued aduantagious vnto him, hee bargayned with certaine Merchants by great for his conduct, neuer troubling the Dukes Nauie, nor his Prerogagatiue to muster vp new forces; whereupon with all conueniencie they prouided him fourty well appointed Shippes, and became creditors themselues for foure Months pay and victuals: In the meane while, the magnificent Company departed, and King Zalby to augment his Nephewes honour, gaue Philano in present possession the Prouince of the nether Comagena; which hee in great courtesie acknowledged: yet modestly respyted the ceremonies of his enstawlement, till his returne. For hee would questionlesse accompany Trezoboro and Anzitemus into Armenia; wherein hee wrought a double contentment. First, the Souldiers and Cittizens were ouerliberally pleased, as imputing loue and care toward them, the motiue of this iourney: next, Anzitemus apprehended it to his comfort, not doubting but

                     Philanos presence would keepe obedience in forme: besides the Treasure returned by so conuenient a Messenger would disburthen him of care and chardge to make a particular vioage. Now are all thinges ready for the departure, and the Duke accompanied them to their Shipps committing their iorny to auspicious influence, so the farwell suffering a ceremonious diuision, gaue the one occation to returne, and the other to steppe into the tract of worldly felicitie: but as Anzitemus studied to contriue his businesse, he stopped at this doubt, whether he should make directly for Armenia, or take Media in his way, where he was sure of Artabanus ayde, and the Persians loues: then againe remembring the Message of Euphamia, he supposed the seedes of dissention were buried past growing, and so he might be warranted of their true fayth: yet for all this to giue way vnto their opinions of his wisdome &amp; gouernment, he called a conference, to which were especially desiered Trezoboro, Philano, Coranus, Bertosus; as for Ardemio, Mitranes and Obecam, they thought themselues Honored in the matter, besides Placandus (whom he determined to fashion to the world, and bring his aged head with Honor to the graue) gloryed in the fauour Anzitemus began wih. All these resolued him, that the fame of Artabazes death, and Astiages ouerthrow, was altredy diuulged in Armenia, and that the dissentions betwixt Media and Persia receiued a period: only

the Maryage of Roxana was deferred, as not knowing how he was affected, and therfore without doubt he might determine for his owne kingdome.
                  Wherupon they made forward apace, and accordinge to their expectation without difficulty (more then the wonder of his returne, because they supposed him lost in the fight with Cleonidas) Landed in Armenia at the Riuer Erix, from whence by easie Iornies ouer the Mountaines, they came to Armamiranda, where Euphamia was resident; to whom the people vpon report of Anzitemus ariuall, had flocked on heapes, desiring her to stand as a guard betweene them and his displeasure, considering their obedience since, and the reuenge vpon Gestarius, who had opened the Dore of the last troubles. To these she onely wished the continuance of their loyalties: but to certaine persons drawne into the faction with Olmus, and of inueterate malice for Cleonidas, (who made her beleeue they would be warranted their safety) shee absolutely denied to bee compelled: For if they determined truth, and vndissimuled duety, no doubt her Sonne (though Artabazes losse was irkesome to them both) knew what belonged to a remedilesse matter. But little needed these suspitions; for Anzitemus knowing that strange courses bred as strange alterations; and that in a good beginning consisted the hope of successe, proclaymed a generall Pardon, and

establishing of all men in their estates, offices, and places, that would ratifie his succession.
                  With this comfort was the whole Kingdome Anzitemus returneth into Armenia &amp; is inuested King. appeased, and for the better assurance of their faythfull hearts, they confirmed the prerogatiues of his Maiestie, and conferred to him whatsoeuer belonged to a Kings person, establishing those Lawes, wherewith his Father and Grandfather had swayed the Common-wealth. The people brought in a guift of a thousand Talents; the Officers to continue their places, liberally fined them selues: the Nobilitie to renew their Immunities, sent many Presents: the Cities to strengthen their Priuiledges, disbursed great summes: the Gentry to aduance them selues, spared for no reasonable matter; and the Courtiers to purchase fauoure, exceeded in cost and diligence: But when the incomparable Brizaca was published their Queene, they passed in extremity of applause, and sacrificed to the Gods for restoring their peace, and establishing the Monarchy in such worth and royalty.
                  THus was Anzitemus and Brisaca solemly inuested, and looking backe with regard vpon the worth of Euphamia, affoorded her the dignities of her Widdowhead, and permitted her the fruition of many Pallaces and Priuiledges: besides, in all Assemblies there was a Throane erected somewhat higher then his owne, that the people might know, shee was the Kings Mother, and how highly

hee desteemed her. Now though Fortune dad taken off the maske of Despight, and shewed him a countenance of fauour; yet neither seemed hee vaine or elated, but reposed, and indeed moderating that excesse of ioy, which sometimes many Princes after their aduancements, cannot hide. But it may be the meditation of his great affaires reduced him, because three especiall matters lifted vp their heads to be seene; and by being seene, to be remembred.
                  The first, was the discharge of the Zagarians, and dismissing Philano, which hee royally performed with a Princely ouerplus, confirming the League, and wishing, if the Persians and Medians did not agree, to hearken after Roxana: but when Trezoboro came to take his leaue of his Friend, it exceeded a Passion, and the louely Philano truly deciphered the force of Affection: So deuiding a Ring betweene them, because subiect to aduentures, they might be sure not to be vnknowne, they parted in body, but the loue of their hearts ended not in death. The Ring was artificially wrought, and enclosed with an enameled Scalloppe made of a Stone taken from the eyes of a Panther; but deuided, was not to be matched without the other: both parts had impression with their owne bloods from this counterchangeable Mott; Nonaliud admittit.
                  
                  The second proceeded from his care to Artabanus, to whom hee had engaged him selfe, especially

about the redaction of both the Kingdomes to one Monarchy: But this was happily without further trouble determined; for not three dayes before Philano departed, the Embassadors of Media and Persia ariued, and after the ceremonie of gratification from all estates was ended, they shewed him a Commission contayning foure principall poynts. First they tyed them selues to yeerely Tribute, as acknowledging him the life, by which their polliticall bodyes did mooue in peace: The second exposed a perpetuetie of Alleageance: for Loue and Dutie was but a slender counterpoise to Life and Honour, which hee had so often aduentured for their sakes: The third concerned the Mariage of Roxana with Darius Artabanus Sonne: The last entreated for Cleonidas, whom destruction had miracuiously spared, &amp; his owne penitency much bettered: To these he breifly made answere, the Tribute he did disclaime, as foreseeing such a Challenge might either grow to intrusion, or moue their deniall, so heere after debate be the destruction of one another. Their loue and frendshippe he much relyed vpon: The Maryage of Roxana he anulled, dilating besides the hapinesse depending: but concerning Cleonidas Anzitemus, interceded, as resolued the differences betweene them, were not so slightly to be ouerpassed,
                  The third and espetiall matter of importance consisted of many diffused partes, and therefore

intermixed the more trouble to vniforme it: and this was, how to reconcile Trezoboro to his father, considering the inconueniences proiected from the prophesie: First the Emperors goodwill hung in suspence, for he that feared before they were borne, could not but tremble now they were men; and of abillitie to defend themselues: Then the returne of Kalucky was doubtfull vpon the notice of the deceite: Thirdly the discussing of the Oracle finding part true in the Maryage of Brizaca must needes hasten dipleasure: Next the mislike of Opacus, because his daughters had so presumed, would sturre vp some troubles: Last of all the ielosie of himselfe, as the Principll cause of mischeife: For commonly men feare most the blow, that commeth last, and the Oracle concluded, that Mengrelius must be slaine by his daughters Husband.
                  THese particulars were orderly debated: at Bertosus is sent Embassador to the Emperor Mengrelius and discouereth the story of Trezoboro. last his loue to his Queene and Trezoboro preuayled, eyther to make a peaceable attonement, or compulsiue entrance into Trebizonda: for which purpose Bertosus was sent Embassadour from the Armenian King to the Emperour Mengrelius, to whom the report of Anzitemus recouery seemed so strange, that his feare of hee knew not what, presaged mischiefe to follow: yet remembring the Prerogatiue of Kings; and that Bertosus
                     
desired audience, hee appoynted a day of hearing; and for the better countenancing his Maiestie, summoned all the Princes and Nobilitie of his Empire; the chiefe was the Empresse Ballutasa: then followed Opacus of Capadocia: Curatsax of 
                           〈◊〉
                        : Phorcanus of pontns, Schidrothemis of Syno

                        , Rhemus of Paphlagonia and Mithridates of Taurica all Kings, confederats, and Tributaries: amongst his naturall subiects Carembello Duke of Raganda supposed the fauorit of the widdow Emprese, Putrasso, Hardubax, Marquidan, Theoricus and Deiphoebus, were principall: diuers others of great worth and Nobillytie added to the state by their presence: as for his Sister Pisana she was long since inuested with the Royalties of Russia, whereby a Crosse-mariage encreased many. Friendes resembling a Sheafe of Arrowes, which bound togeather are not to be broken; but disioyned, are subiect to a slender furie.
                  
                  When Bertosus perceiued the Emperour determined to set foorth the ampliation of his glory; and that this stately shew was of purpose to make apparant his greatnesse, hee not much mislyked the same, though it tended to cause him to vse the more reuerence, wherupon after the ceremony ended, and that their expectation had wrought a still silence, he layed open the recordes of admiration, and red thus distinctlie before them all:
                  Subiects (mighty Emperor) entring into great and

                        
important actions are to consider, whether they be commodious to the Common-wealth, Honorable to themselues, easie, or at least not difficult to be effected, and respectious for whom, or against whom they deale: but Princes, or Princes Embassadours by all constitutions, are licensed to deliuer their Message freely, and to be answered or dispatched honourably. This I am mooued to inferre, because of the strangenesse, wherewith you must be acquainted; yet such may be my fortune, that I shall rather seeme a trusty Mercury from Heauen, then a tedious Herrold on Earth: But howsoeuer, this is the will of the Gods, and the pleasure of the Armenian Kinge.
                  
                  
                     Although the first inconuenience in the Oath to Kalucki hath produced strange alterations, and in a manner sequestred you from the happinesse incident to other Princes, but quite debarred these from the comfort of a naturall Successor: yet if you can be thankefull to supernaturall Power, and louing to your selfe in the receipt, I offer you a rich and inestimable Present. To be more plaine, I bring you glad tydings of a Sonne; and to these of a true Prince, yea such a Prince, that you may presume on Deuine bountie, and Worldly felicitie, considering his preseruation, and perfection. With that hee vnfolded the wrapped vp secret of Trezoboros and Brizacas infancie, his owne troubles in their bringing vp, the theft of Cleonidas, their Shipwracke at Sea, the aduenture of Anzitemus,
                        
the Mariage of Brizaca, and the now setled greatnesse of Armenia, where the heroijcke Trezoboro expecteth the loue of a Father, and is ready to performe the duty of a Sonne.
                  
                  But ere Bertosus had fully concluded, such was the excessiue ioy of the Court, and the ioy exceeding all ioyes of Arcabella, that Mengrelius was quite disappointed, and in a manner compelled to the same passion, least he should seeme a contrary, amongst so many pleasures: wherupon he rewarded Bertosus according to his estate, and confirmed the priuiledge of his place: yet loth to detaine him longer, then was conuenient for feare the people might immagin him Ielious of the newes, he tooke order for his dispatch, and appoynted Mithridates Prince of Taurica to accompany him to Armenia, &amp; attend on Trezoboro to Trebizonda: but neither Arcabella nor Ballutasa could so slightly dismisse him, the one like a true Mother asking diuers questions touching her Children, wherin she was much satisfied, yet beginning againe and againe asked many things worthy of selution: the other like a gallant Princes seemed to glory in the action, and because successe answered her expectation, was very proud to be author of so Famous a deed, nor left she to enquire of the manner of the deliuerie, when Gellida and Perinthum caryed them into Capadocia, for which seruice she had contriued to Crowne the eldest Queene of Phrigia, and to match the other to Omphalus King of Lidia: but

the desier to see the Princes hastneth Bertosus returne, who comming to the Empresses tooke his leaue with gladnesse &amp;, was glad to leaue them in such a taking: but parting with the Emperor, it seemed rather a farrewell of necessitie, then delight, the manner wherof at his returne he imparted to Trezoboro and Anzitemus,
                  
                  In this sort receiued his iorny a limitation, and the faithfull dispatch thereof moued Anzitemus to remember, that vertue meriteth a recompence, and Honor florisheth with the countenance of the Prince, wherfore he determined to aduance both Bertosus and Coranus: had not Trezoboro entreated him not to entercept his good meaning toward them, considering they were subiects of a nother kingdome, and how much they were endeered Placandus made Duke by Anzitomus. to him: so that Placandus at this time Triumphed alone, and was inuested with the Royalties of the Dukdom of Taurasim, the cellebration whereof put Trezoboro in minde of his iorny, and Mithridates vrged it the rather, because Brizaca cheared her selfe with the Societie of her owne Ladies, whom Arcabella had very considerately sent vnto her and seemed reposed in the fulnesse of Princely greatnesse and happynesse, had not the very name of a Father &amp; Mother imposed a taske, one desire to see and know them.
                  THus was she left to the fruition of her ratefied mightinesse, and the Prince setteth forward

toward Trebizonda, but vnderstanding the Court Trezoboro returneth to Trebizonda and is entertained for Prince. was kept in Samarchanda, a rich and populous Cittie, hee studied how to make his entrance, least Mengrelius might except against an ambitious beginning, or vaine popularitie: yet the more hee meditated, the more intricate were his owne conceites: For neuer till this apprehending the incombrances, wherewith Princes were intangled, hee now perceiued the difference betwixt a great and a meane estate: At last, as it were playing his Fathers Sceane, hee would needes enucleate the Prophecy; but a very bitter taste followed, and it represented a Toyle, from which a man striuing to escape, tyed himselfe the faster therein. For no hope remayned, but in descrediting the latter part, considering his miraculous preseruing, and Sisters Mariage had giuen life to the first; yet remembring time must haue his course, and all was to be committed to highest direction, hee onely framed himselfe to giue no cause of mislike, nor by any demeanour to mooue his Father to renew his thoughts of the Oracle.
                  As these particulars had a kind of mutinous passage, hee passed still forward, and came at last within sight of the Cittie, which indeed prepared a day of solemnitie for his welcome, and that neither durst the Emperour interdict, nor Trezoboro gainesay, least he might seeme the occasion of a preposterious beginning, so that he was enforced to moderate that spirit of Maiestie, which his Heroicall disposition

euer maintained, and saluted the companies in order as they came with a still behauiour, &amp; when the applause of the people seemed more then a Triumph, he went forward in quietnesse, vntill the Emperor presented himselfe, who hastned by his wife and mother, (but especially least in the retradance the people might immagin strange matters) was now to giue and receiue the reciprocall comfort proceeding from so blessed a greeting. Heere Trezoboro dismounted, and with obedient demeanor prostrated himselfe to Mengrelius, who could not but like a father, make his ioy the more appeare; &amp; like a Prince reioice with his subiects for such a recouery: So he tooke him in his Armes with teares, and conducted him to Arcabella &amp; Ballutasa 
                     with gladnesse, but they seemed transported to a nother world with his sight and seasure, and as when the Sunne at his going downe is taken into heauen from the sight of the earth, so was the Prince conueyed from the rest betweene them into a new glory, and sence reioycing delight, which continued in firme strength (without so much as any mans whispering the least mistrust of alteration) vntill the cause of their now goodnesse effected the troubles ensuing, by reason Kalucki made acquainted with this discouery, layed claime to the Empire and came in person to plead his right: but we must take a progresse into another Kingdome, before he be ready to come hither.
                  
                     
HOwsoeuer Historiographers haue written of The story of Kalccki and Mullumalla many strange Customes tending to inciuilitie amongst the Tartarians, in regard of the many strange Nations within so spacious a Country; yet haue they all concluded, that no people are of better obseruance toward their Emperour, nor Emperour so imperious ouer his Subiectes; by reason whereof diuers Warres and Stratagems hath made them beleeue, the Crowne was held in the hand of Victorie, to be bestowed on the preuayler: But amongst others, the most famous chaunced betweene Barka and Allau, both Noble, valiant, beloued, and at one time nominated Emperours; yet by no meanes consenting to Deuision or Competition: Now because in such Conuulsions, there is no medium betweene an Emperour and Traytor, either striued as well to liue, as to reigne; so that the dissention continued with great difficultie and extremitie betweene them, at such time, as Kallucki dispossessed in Trebizond, came with his complices into this Country; and politickly considering his estate, made offer of seruice in nature of a mercinarie Souldier vnto Barka, who superstitiously imputed his comming, as sent from Heauen to his assistance, and therfore without curiosity quartered him by himselfe &amp; sent a Treasurer with other officers to attend him: but it was not long ere he made Tryall of his vertue in some slender Skirmishes, which with admiration

of discipline and valiant execution he performed: Then he sent him to surprise a place entrenched, whether Allau had drawne his cheifest strength, and by the same both kept the passages and him selfe from danger, this seemed a matter of difficultie, yet with diuers pioners, and by lodging neere, they were able to make a Mine (a thinge as yet vnknowne amongst them) out of which in the dead of the night they issued on the enemie, and committing a notable slaughter, leueled the place with the ground, and so returned in Triumph: Lastly he put him in trust with Managing the maine Battaile (for Allau would tryfle no longer, but appointed a day of Tryall) wherin his Fortune and vallure ioyned in Leauge. For in that encounter he slew the strong reputed Allau, discomfited his forces, and setled Barka in a quiet possession of greatnesse, as himselfe in a strange commendation of goodnesse, because the people apprehending him the meanes, whereby their troubles ceased, and peace flowrished, performed intercession to the Gods for his prosperitie, and made proferre of themselues to support him in any enterprise of his owne.
                  This was soone perceiued by Mullumalla cheife Empres (for their coustomes allowed many wiues The Empres Mullumalla in loue which Kalucki. and more Concubines, &amp; yet was the Law of adulterie seuerely punished amongst them) who long since found her selfe surprised with his loue, and hunted after euery oportunitie to discouer her affection, which (hauing receiued impression from

the report of so many, who seemed to dote on his worth, &amp; was after strengthned with her one opinion &amp; iudgment from his presence &amp; vertues) grew to a kind of vehemencie, and that hindred by many reasons, and further incombrances, encreased to impatience, because she thought there was yet meanes to do her selfe good, &amp; he being a stranger would to be glad to be the fauorit of an Empres: But as she went forward in this path of incontinency, successe not alwayes respectious to vertuous proceedinges attended without her owne seeking and preiudice, as arising from the I
                           •…
                        rors iniustice vpon this occation.
                  No sooner had the vertue of Kalucki shewed her excellencie, and the people more and more had him in estimation, whereby the new established Barka was to determine something for his recompence and aduancement, but a certaine ielowsie of his insinuating into the fauor of the kingdome, and misconstruing his royall birth and right to Trebizond, which all sortes began already to pittie, and so to fauor, slacked his loue toward him, &amp; weakned the strength of his willingnesse to aduance him, nor leaft his conceite so: but a further peeuishnesse whispered, that he sought to rob him of his subiects hearts: now when strange humours were entertained, strange distempratures followed, in so much that he one while resolued quite to dismisse him, as hauing no further occation to imploy him, but that he thought was too inhumaine, and

his Subiectes would neuer condiscend, vnlesse it were to recouer his Empire: Another-while hee studied to proportion him some remote corner to inhabit in: but heere hee mistrusted, it would be reputed a disgrace, as proceeding from a wearisomnesse of his Company, and then the opportunitie to thinke it a disgrace, might cause him to reuenge it, as if it were a disgrace indeed. Anon hee imagined to send him further, vnder colour of an honourable atchieuement against India; but suspecting the increase of his Renowne in successe, he hapned by the way on another doubt, a reuolt by the same Armie committed to his charge. Thus did the vncertaintie of the best course, inhibit the certaintie of any course, till at last the very feare of Alteration, encreased euery Conceit to preuent the feare: and when no meanes of contentment Barka determineth to murder Kalucki. without his absence appeared, hee depended on this, by some course or other to make him away: as for his Followers, the head beeing cut off, the rest of the members would quickly perish: Yet lay hee awhile in waite to intrappe him in some haynous mulct or other; but fayling: hee concluded by secret callenture, or other diuelish imposture to finish his tragedy.
                  This was neither hid with so close a veyle, but Kalucki perceiued the Emperours incongruent behauiour toward him; nor debated with such trust, but Mullumalla foresaw the mischiefe, which shee not much repined against, because shee

had so good a ground to worke vpon, and so might raise her ambition, faitsfie her loue, and suffulciate her glory: yea though the life of the Emperor payed for it, and although her owne spirit would questionlesse haue ripened conceit to satisfie her desires (for what cannot; nay what will not, a woman, a Prince, and in loue, effect:) yet Fortune added winges to her intiention, and now helped to rowle the stone, which at last tombled Barka out of the world: For as the Emperor vnder Coulor of fauour would needes carry Kalucki to the Pallace of Concubines, but of purpose to make their beuties a baite to allure him, &amp; so by enfringing the seuere edict in that kinde, to haue cause of accusation against him: the Empresse tooke occation of passage by the walke, through which Kalucki must returne to the Court, and perceiuing he had been left alone amogst them to make tryall of his abillytie in resisting the temptation, she somwhat cunningly asked those about her, who it was, that presumed so to come within the Limitts of these places sacred, and prohibyted; and from whence he had now brought him selfe? Answer was made, it was the Prince Kalucki whom the Emperor licensed to view the other Pallace: that will I know fayth she from himselfe, call him therefore heither, least his ignorance by being a stranger breed further errour: But when Kalucki perceiued, it was the Empresse, his inward motions were at variance, and the very bloud of his

                        
vaines seemed troubled, like as Wine riseth into bubles, when a lumpe of Sugar is throne into the Glasse, or is sturred with a greater strength: yet come he must, and fall downe he must, and rise againe he must, &amp; answer many questions he must, as how the Emperor pleased to grace him? how he liked the Ladyes, and their attiyre? whether he knew the fault of his being there? and many other to the same purpose: all which he answered like himselfe a man, a Prince, and vnmoued with nouelties. At last seeing the prerogatiue and custome had taught her attendants to stand so remote, that they were out of hearing, she left thinges impertinent to giue him notice, there was some good toward him, and preparing his attention, vsed these speeches.
                  
                     Before I enter (thou honorable Stranger) into the channell of my Discourse, let mee giue thee notice of the Countries wherein wee liue, and the Customes wee obserue. The first mighty, large, rude, vncitied, and in many places deformed: yet somewhat capable of Discipline, and assured Friendes to Vallour: The latter, not greatly Religious, nor caryed away with the nicetie of Vertue, seldome maintayning Iustice: For the stronger Arme supprefseth a weake; and hating, or at least neglecting any Stranger whatsoeuer, onely your selfe may boast of great happinesse in the loue of the people, and opinion of the better sort, (though I must confesse farre short of your desert) and

presume on exceeding specialitie neuer affoorded any other, but withall, as you see a Fire of filthy weedes to giue a glorious light, but to leaue a long time after a most odious stincke: So hath this applause caried a pleasant shew toward you; But no lesse then your life must answer the displeasure arysing from the same: For the Emperour intoxicated with a violent suspition against you, trembleth at the feare, and hath concluded alreadie your death; What resteth now, but preuention? That cannot be wrought but by my meanes: nor can I proceed, but by your consent, and respect of such a Friend, as must and will saue your life. Be not therefore curious of my mislike to Barka, breach of Vowes, affection to your selfe, and such petty questions. But suppose after approoued goodnesse, I shame to see thee subiect to apparant inhumanitie; now resteth in thy choyce either life or death. To this, a hundred seuerall Mullumalla contriueth to saue Kaucki. passages are open: To that, onely one Dore is vnlocked, and looketh both to life and Maiestie. To be plaine; either the Emperour must yeeld to the summons of a hasty Death, or thy selfe to the arrest of a violent Execution. If then with vnderstanding this abruptnesse, thou canst remember thy selfe; and by thy selfe, the danger to be acquainted with the affaires of Princes; and by that danger, to contriue the contrary saftie; and by that saftie, to reioyce with her, that determineth all honour vnto thee, I am satisfied: and hope in

                        
conceiuing mee a right, neither is your Courage, nor Wisedome so rebated, but you can put a difference betwixt a happy life, and miserable death.
                  
                  This sodaine breuitie, but full of substaunce, and so well graced with a maiestical Spirit, brought with it her accustomed companion Amazement: yet because there was nothing heere inferred (except the loue of the Empresse) which hee before suspected not, his Answere seemed the redier; and with addition of extraordinarie demeanour, strengthened her liking the rather toward him. For when he saw that counterpleading would rather shew a Demissnes, then Conscience; and that all good courses were vnprofitable with vntractable people, hee graciously submitted to her behests, not without protestation, that her Beautie and magnificense, had attracted his regard more, then desire of any Greatnesse: So that hee rested like Wax moulded with her warme hand, ready for what impression it pleased her to bestow onely hee impetrated, that if it were possible, hee might be exempted in the bloody attempt; because hee would not pollute his hands with a Princes massacre. This shee tooke as an excellent part of Generositie: So that as much inflamed with his Vertues, as Person, shee dismissed him to his owne care, and setled her selfe to the strange course of the Emperours death; which ledde her vp by casier staires, then she could imagine.
                  
                     
For the Emperor fully resolued to his murder compacted with Chamus, Ilion, Iodda and Tarachim to be the executioners: but Tarachim either a secret instrument of the Empresse, or taking remorce to see iniustice rebell against vertue or pollytickly forecasting for his owne priuate, as perceiuing to what end her desires tended: once againe discouered the substance and circumstance of the cause to Mullumalla, and that he wanted nothing but a time to put it in practise. And hath he no body (saith she) to make the slaue of wickednesse, but a man endeered to vs for his Nobillytie of blood, and euer till now the seruant of Honour and vertue? Beleeue me I thinke you are bewitched so strangly to be drawne into your owne ruines, for what trust can he repose in you, that can be hired with Mony to doe mischeife: without question it is but a plot of tryall against your selues, who will euer make account of the Murderers of a Prince; yea such a Prince, to whom the kingdome must yeeld the Tribute of your peace: but if there were possibillytie to belecue, that any many durst immagin such a thought: by the silence of the night I sweare, were he not my Emperor, I iudge him worthy of death in his base submission to such villany, therefore Honorable Tarachim deceiue not thy selfe in Barkas meaning, nor be againe deceiued, though he meane as thou sayest, For then can it proue no otherwise then absolute tirany, and to free the Common wealth of a Tyrant is indeed

an action of renowne: This she spake to put his disposition to the touch, and finding him willing to be diuerted, she then strengthned him in that resolution: this made him more flexible toward her, and that perswaded a wondefull contrarietieb, ringing in the Ielosie of his owne life, so the feare to preuent it submitted to her directions: againe, she with a doubtfull manner of speech, that if he had sayd the truth it were better a wicked Emperor miscaried, then men of vertue and good deseruing: and last of all with reasons, promises, and protestations to make the fact iustifiable, tooke his oth to kill the Emperor: Which he very opportunely performed in a walke adioyning to the Pallace, as conferring togeather in secret about Kalucki, and no sooner shruncke the bleeding Carkase to The murder of Barka. the ground, but he wounded himselfe in many places with the Emperors Semiter, quight conueying away the instrument of death, and so stood crying for helpe in a pittifull manner.
                  By this time hath the strange reporte of the Emperors murder possessed both Court, and Country with amase, and the murtherer without any pursuite quickly submitted him selfe: but brought before the Empresse &amp; the rest to whom such a cause papertained, he confessed the fact: yet desiered that he might take away the shame, though not the fault in the misfortune, by discouering the secrete as it chanced, now because his bleeding woundes induced commiseration, and that his present sta

shew of violence against him, it was thought conuenient to heare him, and if it were, but to bolt out the rest of the conspirators. Most deuine Empresse (quoth he) &amp; Honorable vpholders of this mightie state, I intend neither to entreat for fauour nor life, (for in the very misfortune of the mischeife, I am worthy to dye) yet giue me leaue to extenuate your displeasures against me, and to disclaime either a naturall disposition to such impietie, or now willingnesse to lay violent handes on such a person: wherein that my true simplicitie may somewhat countenance me, and that I plead for my Honour and renowne, giue me leaue to Launce my Barcke into this Channell. Who doth not remember the misery of our Country through the ambition of our Emperours Barka and Allau, deceassed? Who doth not acknowledge the blessings conferred vnto vs by the Prince, Kalucki, who with all vertuous industries hath proceeded for our good? yet (mighty Peeres) I shame to tell it, without respect of worth, royaltie, honour, or the benefite it selfe, some wretched Ielousie so misled our Emperour, that very ingratefully (if I make not too great offence in the tearme) hee contriued many wayes his destruction, misconstruing our Loues, and his Vallour, to tend to an aspiring reach: and when nothing appeared to appease his misdoubts, hee flatly concluded to murder him secretly: To which bestiallity, hee suggested Chamus, Iliod, Iodda, and my selfe, ouerreaching

our Obedience with Imperious will, and insorcering out fraylty with Reward and Preferment. Now what euer good or bad Angell was ouer this dismall night predominant, I know not; but sending for mee into the Walke, hee conferred about the Murder; and because my slacknesse seemed rather enclined to remorce, then dispatch of the tyranous decree, all impatient hee flew vpon mee, wounding mee in this manner, neuer repressing his furie, till I lost the vse of respect and consideration: then life straue with necessitie, and compelled her seruant strength to the cloze, hoping onely to saue it selfe; wherein, howsoeuer it chanced, the Swod in the fall, strooke him to the heart: which how grieuous it is vnto mee, the immortall powers, that haue deliuered Kalucki, and preserued all your glories, can witnesse.
                  
                  This vnlookt-for contrarietie, made them all amazed, yet when the examination of the rest, and other circumstances agreed with the truth, most strange was the confusion amongst them: For the people with great acclamations cryed out, Liue Kalucki, liue Tarachim. The Empresse tooke heauily her Husbands misfortune; but seemed more troubled with his infamy. The Princes of the State knew not what to say, or how to proceede. The people they continued with zeale towarde Kalucki; and in a manner protested Mullumella could not doe better, then make him satisfaction by mariage. Heere Wisedome played a kind

For though her Desire burned within her to the same purpose, yet a still modesty kept her from making shew of any such motion: and when the greatest Lords (as not knowing how to suppresse it, being a matter of that consequence, &amp; the party a man of that high deseruing) vrged it againe. Shee sayd it was a time of sorrow, and the loue toward them, would not consent to any thing vnbefitting: But when indeed another and another time was spent in yeelding reasons of the likelihood of happinesse; and that her cunning had drawen them to beleeue their importunities should preuaile with her, shee welcommed the fortune, that had thus smiled vpon her, and tooke Kalucki into the tuition of her loue; which quickly inuested him Emperour, and sware the Subiects to loyalty and obediene.
                  Now was hee to play the part of an Emperour, and by reason of the naturall rudenesse of the Kalucki Emperour of Tartary. Country, and inciuility of the people; the one to be refined, the other reduced, the greater was his need of those excellent ornaments of Kings: but being him selfe a naturallist of Maiesty, hee soone put in practise Magnanimitie for his State and Court; Wisedome for the common causes, and (extracted from her) Pollicy to keepe the great men in obedience, Affability (as farre as their Customes permitted) to obtaine fauour, where it hung in suspence; and Iustice to strengthen the loue got by meere good hap. Besides, hee knew

how Mullumalla had proceeded, and therefore was shee to be regarded with extraordinary behauiour: But heere was no place for Mistrust or Ielousie, because shee prooued an admirable Wife and Mother of many Children; and the people continued in their loue, as hauing no cause to mislike.
                  BVt as he went forward in this towardly Iornie Kalucki enformed, how his brother had broken promise and couenant with him, determineth to be reuenged. to felicitie, fame that euer scorned to be pend in a Corner came to tell him, the Emperour Mengrelious had infringed the couenants ratefied, and a Prince liued in scorne of his composition, which somewhat distempred him, as forseeing the troubles impending, or shame to let his Honour be abused: but when Scaroxus the brother of Queridock, whom Mengrelius had dispossessed of the Royalties of Sinopis by placing Scydrothemis King, had in person vrged other particulars: then was Mullumalla made acquainted with the story from the beginning, and she Calucki certefied his brother had a sonne. (though desier could haue pleaded, that no satisfaction was answerable to his company) yet stomached the indignity, and in her Heroiick spirit concluded, his renowne hung in suspence without reuenge: Now rested the doubt, what course to take: And therein many times and much debating shewd as well the dutie of a wife, as Honour of a Prince: at last she willed him by sommoning

the Estates of the Empire to make tryall of their affection; (which hee performed, because it pleased; and it pleased, because shee wished: and shee wished, because he was so great a person: and greatly beloued) to whom after the Ceremonies of the assembly were ended, he deliuered these speaches.
                  Although (louing and worthy to be beloued 
                        Lords and Subiects) the deuine prouidence and your fauours hath collated this Empire without desert or my owne first seeking: yet must I not now either degenerate from that I am, or appeare other, then I should be, least you may immagin former basenesse, or present demisnesse: but because matters of Armes and martiall exploites are intended (and as may be obiected rather for my priuate satisfaction, then your generall good) I determined to acquaint you with the story from the beginning, and so fell into the addition of many circumstances, with this last newes of Scaroxus, which they neuer heard of: Now, if you thinke it meete, that so great a commander ouer so many valiant people, and such spatious Countries should digest a defamation, which pettie Princes would aduenture to reuenge, I must submit, and for your sakes, or peace will make the Warre of a distempred conscience: But if my calamitous discourse hath wrought any impression, whereby with your loues and assistance I may proceed, then doe I expostulate your constancie, and account my selfe more happy, then Fortunate: For if you haue

rightly vnderstood me, my meaning is not to lead you to destruction, or driue you like a Tyrant to a slaughter house: but I expose vnto you the recouery, Citties, Possessions, Ritches, and what men can desier, of a large and fertile Countrie to which without doubt the Gods will consent, so your abashed drawing backe be not signes of ill successe.
                  
                  When it seemed he determined silence, the company rather wondring at his perfections, then misunderstanding his speeches, gaue a great Plaudite, crying, the Gods preserue Kalucki; the Gods protect our Emperor; and with vnfainednesse offered themselues and goods freely to the enterprise: this made him feast them all sumptuously by way of gratification, and that brought them to care and reuerence toward him the easier: so a Councell of Warre disputed the matter, and dispersed the seuerall Commanders to rayse vp Forces to make his Armie the greater: For though hee had euer in readinesse a hundred thousand in Armes, besides his owne, Companies brought with him from Trebizond, and now foure-score Thousand seruing for a Guard to his person; yet were his Foure principall Kingdomes; that is to say, Ieckomongall, Sumongall, Merchat, and Metrit, assessed at Fourtie thousand a peece, mustred and orderly trayned (in respect of their former disorder) at Coralla, where the Rendezuous was appoynted.
                  
                     
THus with a mightie Armie he marched along, Malucki returneth to challenge the Empire of Trezibonda. leauing Mullumalla Regent in his absence, who the morning of his departure had sacrifised two whight Hartes to Diana, and by their forward going to the Alter, presaged good successe, and his returne: and hauing framed an Imperiall Diadem set on many degrees, and beautified with inestimable Pretious stones, which were supported in euery barre with her owne pro
                        •…
                     ature (a thing questionlesse both for worth and workmanshippe of admiration) she Crowned him therwith in the sight of the Armie, and so with a Warlike ceremony committed him to the tuition of the Sunne: Thus is he come to the confines of Albania, and there rested himselfe, studying which way to proceed in the best course, and at last creating Queridock Prince of his Emperiall tent, made him an Embassador to Mengrelius with these instructions: That whereas he had been dispossessed of the Empire of Trebizonda by wrong and despight, and was contented to embace him selfe to strange conditions to auoyde effusion of blood: they had yet, to adde to his indignytie scorned him, and infringed the Lawes both of Honor and nations: that seeing this contempt was intolletable, &amp; the Couenants enioyned him to lay claime to his right, he came in person with an Armie of three hundred Thousand well appyoynted Soldiers to performe the same, that if it seemed good

to the Emperials to admitte him to quiet possession, considering it was but a smale satisfaction of his first wronges, no worthy man should be displaced, and he would desist from the way of conquest: That if they impugned his desires, then to denounce open hostilly, and giue them warning, the businesse was remedilesse, and he mercilesse.
                  This Embasie did Queridocke deliuer with a gallant spirit and grace, not without intimation of iniustice concerning him selfe, and diuers others banished their naturall Country▪ which in a manner distracted the hearers, by reason they could not denie what he sayd, nor durst accord to what hee importuned, and had not their present peace, but espetially the vndoubted towardlinesse of the Heroijck Trezoboro suggested infinite miseries, and wretchednesse in the best change, without doubt there would haue followed a most terrible confusion.
                  But now is Mengrelius perplexed many wayes with the arrogant Message, the opinion of his Subiects, the remembrance of his first wrong, the trouble of the Warres, the errours of his Mother and Wife, the alteration of the State, the displeasure against Opacus for his Daughters sauing his Children, the duty of a Father now they were preserued, and the feare of the Prophecy, which indeed dogged him at the heeles, and followed him like a shadow: So that no way of safety appeared, but

in his Sonnes destruction; which as hee supposed, would both satisfie Kaluckies claime, and settle his owne ielosie, yet loth to discouer his feares in publike, or enterpose such a mischeife in the times of rumors and occations of Warre: he went more cunningly to worke, and vnder Colour of the common good thus spake to the estates of the Empire, which he had assembled at Samarchanda.
                  
                  So great is the mischeife threatned against vs (most happy people, but in my vnhappines) that I searce know, how to preuent it: because on the one side my fatherly affection and your loues, must and will disclaime any strange courses against my sonne, on the other side, my dignitie importuneth a Prinsely connexion of soueraingtie, and nature it selfe Countermandeth the Tiranous composition, which I am sure began in Iniustice, and you may obiect will end in destruction: but because my Country &amp; people are in a degree before my Children: yea my owne life and least the commonwealth should complaine for vexing her with these intollerable wronges: if there may be reason in this vnreasonablenesse: I abiure the name of a Father, and offer my sonne as a Sacrifice of attonement: I renounce the Royaltie which now seemeth like a glorious Sunne; and submitte for your satisfaction: I cast downe my life to be put into the other Bällance against your affliction: For neither Mengrelius, nor Trezoboro shall be themselus to make you worse, then your

selues, yet be not too sodden in censuring me carelesse of him, whom you see the heauens haue cared for; nor too submisse concerning my owne Honor which I haue so charylie preserued; For if you will vouchasafe to ioyne with me, all helpes of pollecy and courage shall be vnited, that the body and communitie of this Empire remaine vndissolued, and before I submit to any diuision of Titles, which now your respects haue conferred, the world shall tremble at the report of these stratagemmes, and death giue a plaudite to my last Tragicall act, but once againe like a louing mother, which is still taking her leaue of her departing sonne, and haueing one spetiall matter to counsell him in, doth often and very often remember it: so like the Father of the Common-wealth, doe I put you in minde, while it is time, to thinke vpon the horrible end of this tryall: For to affright vs the more, we are to contend with Beastes, and men worse then Beastes, Anthropophagi, Misocoli, Monsters in nature, and all Barbarisme, so that nothing but bloud and death, or vtter ruin of vs all (which the Gods interdicte) must follow in the preuailing: Preuent therefore, Preuent in time your troubles heere; is Mengrelius began the inconuenience, heere is Trezobro the cause of your feare, heere is both father and sonne the Ransome of your disquiet.
                  
                  But as a further vehemencie might haue vnshadowed the heate of other humors, the people vnwilling

to see their Prince so distempred, and vnable to dissolue their firme rooted zeale, cryed aloud, the Gods confound the disturbers of our peace, the Gods dispose of all thinges to their pleasure: liue therefore Mengrelius sacred, and irremoueable: spare not to defend your kingdomes, for we will neither hassard our Princely Trezoboro, nor permit any dissipation of our gouernment.
                  THus is Kalukies Embassage contradicted, and Mengrilius is resou

                     Queridock dismissed backe, which caused defiance to rumour terrible thinges, and the best dispositions were shuffled betwixt feare &amp; hope: At last Kalucki vnwilling to trifell, least prouision for so great an Armie might be wanting, sent forward the greatest part of his Forces deuided into three Battailes vnder the conduct of Sicambus, Mallau, Petroslol, Zami, and Xantippus, all in times past of hereditary possessions in Pontus, Iberia, and Colchidos: and followed himselfe with the rest quartered in fiue partes, vnder the commaund of Misogambus, and Olippo, two of the Empresse Mullumallas bretheren, and Barsangol and Iubar, sonnes of Mithra and Delium, two Queenes of late the Concubines of Barka: In the midest was Kalucki himselfe sequestred in an Emperiall Tent, &amp; according to the ceremonious respect of his estate, neither to bee seene nor spoken withall, but at spetiall

times: The ordring of this businesse was not committed to such a secretary, but the Emperour of Trebizond knew the manner of his proceedings: and by that time he had passed Cularopa furnished himselfe reasonable well: For from Taurica, the heither Scithia: Russia, and Hiperborei, he had one hundred Thousand Auxiliaries: out of Colchidos, Pontus, Iberia, and Paphlagonia he mustered eightie Thousand: and from the Citties of Samarchanda, Trebizond, Merlanes, and Xantippi he receiued twentie Thousand well appointed, and of better spetiallitie, by reason they were the sonnes of Noble men, and Cittizens glorying in their ancient freedomes: these he kept next his person, and appoynted Curatsax, Pharcanos, Scydrothemis, &amp; Mithridates ouerseers of his Guard, as for Trezoboro he suffered his forwardnesse to direct the whole businesse as if his hope receiued life, that some action or other might worke his miscarying.
                  Thus is the Trumpet of defiance ready to sound on both sides, yet meane not the Trebizondians in such suddennesse to put it to the Tryall of a field, because by being possessed of the streites and passages: the enemie was sure to lessen his numbers, and they winn time the Father of many contrarieties: but the Circumstances of this great Warre are referred to my booke of Battailes, I therefore ouerpasse them now, and only certefie you, that when Mengrelius perceiued he was not able

to detaine them longer from a day of terror, he tooke a Truce for seauen dayes, laying open the Trenches, and making the way plaine, as if he determined to entertaine slaughter with handsomnesse, or let death haue a larger freedome by easie passage: So that the stoutest Courage was appauled at the preperation, and had no other hope but dismay and confusion: yet feares are enemies to the Progres of victory, and therefore all abatements of Courage were absented, when it came to the tryall indeed, and Kalucki contrary to the coustomes of his greatnesse, thought good to ouerlooke the partes of his Warrelike body, that if neede required, the helping a disease or fault in time, might preuent a greater mischeife: nor desisted hee so, but Mounted on a throne of purpose to bee seene and herd, he thus tooke his farrewell.
                  I intend not to vse many wordes vnto you, as suspitious of your loues and vallures: For if there were such a slackenesse, it is now too late to murmure or Trifell; but because my regard toward you may bee the better expressed, I am the bolder to speake, yet doe but determine to put you in minde of your owne mindes, and knowledge: Remember then, what humour soeuer the enemie entertaine, we are succorlesse, and farre from home, therefore must vallure make your way into new possessions, or if you suppose the ostentation of the enemie, is a glorious spectacle, you

haue Armes and Hands to vnplume them, and bedeck your selues with their spoyles: but what is this to your owne liues and glories, which in a manner enforce you to shake off all incombrances of feare as for my selfe? (though I am loth to degeneratte from the ancient prerogatiues of your Emperors) yet will I be the first to giue the onset: For the cause being mine, mine shall be the Honour or the shame; and yours the spoyles, wherein besides the renowne of the exployte, the poorest vassaile shall thinke himselfe well rewarded. The Country you see is pleasing, and the blessinges you haue already tasted of; goe one therefore goe on: Fortune bidds you goe on; and Victory lookes already with a pleasing Conntenance. Heere a wonderfull clamour seemed to threaten heauen with the noise, by which the Trebyzondians had warning of their enemies ill meaning toward them: For till this they had beene awtentiue vnto Mengrelius, who very well knew, that a seasonable encouragement with addition of the worth of the partie speaking, was a veary whet-stone of Courage, and had wrought great effect indeed with whole Armies almost ready to faint.
                  Littleneed I (sayed he) debate any particulars concerning the former occasions of your now imminent troubles: For your owne Loyalties and resolutions haue put a way all feare, and continued the steadfastnesse, which I now finde, yea hurried

                        
you to the Gates of danger to make demonstration of your constancie: I am therefore sure you will not now relent, what euer mischeife is threatned, nor would I haue you discouraged, in that neither spoyles of Citties, nor ritches of a plentifull Land shall be the recompence of your charge and endeauors, but rather annimated in regard you are to support a florishing Common-wealth, and a Country (thankes to the eternall Powers, beautified with a blessed plentie: If this seeme a slender enforcement, then looke on your Byrths and the places challenging naturall regard, your Mothers, that bare you, your Wiues endeered vnto you, your Children, that exclaime: your friends and Allies depending vpon you, and your selues, knowing the necessitie of life: as for the Enemie, I assure you, they haue not that aduantage by the number of men, as your selues by discipline, vallure, and good order: But why should I so much as wisper misdoubts amongst you, when neuer appeared more loue and dutie; and what will not loue and dutie effect? And the immortall Powers are appeased, giuing notice of in scrutible secrets, as you can all witnesse the Haruspices haue promulged, let not vs then consent to surquedry or demisnesse.
                  
                  As he was going on, the signe was giuen to the Battaile: But behold, a strange interception deuided the Armies by the descending of a thicke and spatious Cloude, which stood as a Wale betweene

For the Gods had proclaimed Trezoboro the sonne of peace; and when Mengrelius vrged it was by the way of sacrifice, they repugned, as finding no blood must be shed: by this, the former terror vanished, and the Armies seemed Metamorphised into sober expectation, which caused the Magnificent Prince to mount himselfe like the sonne of Honour, and stepping before the maine Fronts with a seemely Trotte he paced to the Tartarians, desiring to present himselfe before the Emperour Kalucki and king of Kings, who enformed of the gallant demeanor, and presence of his Nephew, called the principall commaunders of his Armie, and setled in his Emperiall Tent with exceeding Maiestie and Pompe, admitted him audience: but when Trezoboro tooke notice of the state, and the Emperours person, he quickly alighted and with a respectious ceremony of obeisance, entreated his fauor to giue him leaue to speake: which belike was obtained with order; For he thus began.
                  
                     I haue not presumed (most reuerent, sacred, and vnuanquishable Emperiour) in any impudent manner to neglect my dutie by this Course, or desperat

contempt to weigh with slightnesse your high Maiestie, or great Armie, but by deuine inspiration whereof there is none, that hath not in some sort participated: I present vnto you the strange truth of my birth, life, and bringing vp, whereby shall appeare a very destinie to this titular happinesse, or (as it may proue) incombrance; and that the wronges, which haue thus sturred you to reuenge, were neither determined in mallice, nor meane now to be continued in contempt, because the Triumphs of murder and destruction will then be lamentable: which to preuent, the Gods in their accoustomed mercy haue giuen a Prodigious warning: Let vs not therefore with the Giants fight against heauen, nor reiect the blessed fauor, which now shineth vpon vs, as if it were to de clare the will of all working power, disclaimeth effusion of blood: and for my selfe, which am the reputed cause, you see I come as a simple Hollocaust to redeeme the liues of infinite Thousandes: yet giue mee leaue (how euer it pleased you to submitte at that time to vnkinde banishment) to exprobrate the vnnaturall couenants ratefied, which as it should seeme the whole senate of heauen contradicted. With that, he discouered at large the Oracle at Delphos, the manner of his Byrth, the pietie of Opacus daughters, the theft of Cleonidas, the Shipwrack of Bertosus, and the mariage of Brizaca.
                      Now said he, if you thinke it conuenient to impeach this secret, heere I prostrate my selfe to

the sauagest crueltie, but if an honorable attonement might pacefie your iust conceiued displeasure, and reward this Armie, wee offer a yeerely Tribute to thy byrth-right, a satisfaction for all charges, and a Million of Treasure as a donatiue to the Soldiers: besides, the world shall tremble at the vnitie of your houses, and ages to come, reuerence the Fame of two such bretheren; For you being the seruant of the great God, and ruler ouer all rulers, Mengrelius will be your seruant, and submitte as farre, as such a Monarch may doe to his elder Brother, and highest Lord.
                  
                     These speaches iudicially deliuered (his outward countenance tempered betweene an amiable and modest behauiour) breathed a contentment, as if a soft Winde sturring the sweete Flowers, should thereby infuse delight to our Senses: wherevpon succeeded the effectes, a still Desire to be fedd with the Pleasure: and Pitty challenging Mischance, which should hinder them from that walke. So Trezoboro was for a time graciously dismissed; and a Truce of fourteene dayes gaue them entercourse one to another: in which space, the assembly of Estates sate dayly to finish this strange building of Peace: As for the Souldiers, their conceites stretched no farther, then to woonder at the Story, to be mooued with the miracle, to pittie Trezoboros youth and comlynesse, to wish an attonment on all sides, and to returne with wealth, libertie and credit: at last, such was the apprehension of their

present state, and miracle disposing their humours to contrarieties, that Kalucki (after Mengrelius consented to readmitte those Trebizondians, that would returne to former libertie and estates, or like recompence) sent Misogambus and Olippo with presents of ratification, who with sound of Trumpet in both the Armies proclaimed an inuiolate Truce: whereupon a stately Colosseum of brasse was erected betweene the Armies, insculped with the whole occurrents, as they chanced in order, to which bargaine of felicity Ballutasa and Arcabella set their seales: the one, thanking the Gods for the aduancement of her Children: the other, sacrificing to Fortune, that had so many waies encreased her happynesse. Thus doe the brothers to the great applause of the people, greet one another; and the state of the Spectacle would make a vollume in the description: but time must determine all thinges, and these great Armies be deuided: so Kalucki with treasure, Honor, and reuerence returned to the magnanimous Mullumalla; to whom he made an offortory of himselfe and ritches, and Mengrelius with peace, libertie, and delight, was welcomed to Trebizond; where prosperitie seemed for the time, to keepe her mansion, had not the wrathfull Nemesis (who neuer leaueth wrong and iniustice vnpunished) sent for Ielosie and Suspition to attend on her in the progresse of visiting Mengrelius, least the will of the Gods should prooue a mockery, and the ineuitable decrees

of Destinie be not accounted of: and thus she meanes to contriue her entertainement.
                  NO sooner was the Trebizondian Armie dissolued, The story of Mengrelius and Trezoboro: with the fathers ielosy against the sonne by reason of the prophesie. but Trezoboro sollemly proclaimed the Prince of peace, as well to cellebrate their late quietnesse, as to practise Martiall exploytes, went about some fruites of idlenesse with gloryous shoes to the people, and many Tri umphes to the Court: whereby he made way to the peoples loue to come in at, and euery mans eyes were fixed vpon his youth and comlinesse: as you see some forren Plant gracing a curious Garden, and the commers in regarding the rest to no purpose: this was despightfully pried into by some hatefull polliticeans, that terrefied the Emperor with blasoning his sonns demeanor, which might winn the hearts of the kingome from him: to these certaine old Councellers, rather stomaching to see their impatience &amp; peremptorinesse abhorred, then daring to set a foote Broyles and discentions, added the greatnesse of the charge (considring the Treasure was much wasted with their last businesse) the disorders of idle attendants, the pride of his followers, the slendernesse of the present Court, all which set his thoughts at randome, &amp; some of them stumbled on the wrested interpretations of the prophesie, which Mengrelius (fearing most the blow, that came last) absolutely beleeued, began to draw neerer and neerer to the full effect,

and so began a strange manner of Melancholy, sequestring him selfe from conuersation; and when necessitie compelled him abroad, hee grew impatient and irrigular: but the greatest cause of his disquiet, accrewed from the suggestion of diuers, who through the credite of Belgorundo, made euery paltry appearance of a litle skill to carry the true countenance of Learning and Diuination, by putting in practise the Cabalisticall Art, Aegyptian Characters, Astronomicall Figures, Hierogliphicall representations, Augurings, and Pithonicall Incantations; which with some slender likelihood were intermixed: so that the Court swarmed with a troope of diuelish Astronomers (a kind of people alwayes forbidden, and alwayes retained) whose strange Attire and Demeanour, gaue occasion of laughter and astonishment: the people counting them wise and extraordinary; the better sort deriding them, as buffonns and deceiuers.
                  With such illusions was Mengrelius quite caried from him selfe, and on a sodaine consented to a decree, that none (of what estate soeuer) should intermeddle with the Emperors retyering, nor appoynt extraordinary meetings without the verge of the Court, which was strangely taken at the first: but Trezoboro discouering the secret, was contented to repaire to the Pallace; which his presence quickly filled with entercourse of people, and the applause range by the Emperors eares; who in short time misliked it farre worse then the other, as almost by

eye-witnesse perceiuing, he meant to infinuate into the vulgar opinion to irrite a faction: From hence a plaine displeasure arose by commaunding the Prince to depart the Court: then wrought his absence beliefe of euery thing reported; and added withall, that the opportunitie made him study on the disgrace, and so prepare the reuenge; (For indeed there wanted not those, which proposed to Trezoboro his Fathers cruelty at the beginning, his wretched hate now, the errours of many men about him; and that there was no reason he should permit the indignitie: but these he suffered as Spiders in an house seruing to gather the Poyson and Venome of the Ayre, that the rest may be more sweete and holsome:) till at last, a wretched surmise displaied the ensiugnes of hate against him; which was too true, by reason all his fauourites and attendants were remooued, or neglected. Calisthenes aman of an high linage, and dilicat witte, which by some extraordinary pleasantnes got the name of Good conceit; and yet till now made gratious with the Empresse, was checked with the tearme of mimus for slender glauncing at the Emperors melancholy. Another demanding but the cause of the Princes sequestration, was imprisoned. A third, making a Satiricall Inuection against especiall persons, was publickly whipt. A fourth, saying, the Prince was more worthy submitted to the execution of a seuere Iudgement: which made a great alteration; and to be plaine, slacked the reuerence

and dutie euer borne toward him.
                  Thus remained all places full of rumours, wherein confusion spred many dispositions abroad: some saying the Emperor was ill directed, or worse inclined: some that the Prince was causelesly wronged: some layed the fault on priuate persons, who hauing a long time swaied the Common-wealth, feared least the quicke conceite of others would detect their ill gouernment, and therefore ment vnder publike pretences to preuent priuate mischeifes: some blamed the Emperors credulytie of the coosening sort of Magy: some affirmed he was quite distracted, and some dared exclaime, that fearing he knew not what, he would ruine the Common-wealth, and Butcher vp his Children, as he had done before: These speeches had diuers effects both with Mengrelius and Trezoboro, the father assuring it a practise of defamation, and the sonne suspecting his fathers crueltie; which was the more greeuous vnto him, because he had deserued so well: so that now to secure himselfe he was enforced to stand on his Guard, and that incited the Emperor to proclaime him Trator, Trezoboro in Armes &amp; proclaimed Traytor. the seueritie of which edict deuided the kingdome, and an vnnaturall Ciuell warre ensued, wherein many stratagems and Turmoyles dislocated the Pillars &amp; stayes of the Empier: for Mengrelius with his yeeres grew wilfull, irregular, and dangerous, mistrusting his most trusty Seruants; and when any dared to request a Pacification,

he would not abide it. His Mother and Wife were ircksome, and all things at home framed them selues to the vnframing his quiet. Abroad he was sure the Cities would regard their preseruation to come. The discontented persons would adhere to his Sonne, as well to auoyde the Lawes penall against them, as in hope of recompence and reward. The Noble men and Gentrie, by reason of former neglect, would questionlesse make them selues acceptable to the Prince. Some yet aduanced, would not degenerate: and others in Office or Account, for their own safeties would continue alleageance: with these, &amp; such, whom the very name of Emperor mustred vp, he made an ouer-maistring party, and in his owne person performing actions beyond expectation, strengthned the opinion of such, as stood wauering betwixt duty and pitty.
                  But when Trezoboro perceiued, that hee which standeth onely on defence, is farre from Victorie, hee then shewed his Father the force of a mighty Arme; with which he held out a long time: but at last, was compelled to retire to Pelagium, a place designed him for his Estate, and conuenient for Victualing and relieuing his Armie. Hither did Mengrelius prosecute him, and Trezoboros flight somwhat ouerswayed the common opinion, neuer certaine, but in vncertainties; so that the Emperor seemed cheared with his good proceedings, &amp; his Sonnes tryall; whereupon somewhat cunningly thinking to presse the Enemie, while they were

yeelding, hee proclaymed Pardon to all those, which would forsake the Prince: the rest he denounced guiltie of the Crime of Maiestie: Then seemed he to dally with crueltie, promising one hundred Tallents to any would bring him in dead or a liue: and last of all, encountred with his forces to great aduantage, which Trezoboro perceiuing would in time worcke him out, and that his retardance gaue libertie for a Russian Armie to helpe his father, he dispatched a messenger to Anzitemus, and an other to Opacus of Capadocia, who by reason of the Emperors ielosie and stomach against them, as the causes of his feare, were not vsed, not sent vnto in their late troubles, and therefore conceiuing they were neglected or despised, a displeasure arose against Mengrelius, and this opportunitie made them the willinger to ioyne with the Prince: especially Anzitemus, who with foure legions of old soldiers came in person to his ayde: as for Opacus, from Phrigia, Lidia, and his owne kingdome, he made an Armie of one hundred 20. Thousand, and gaue the Honor of their conduct to Delano a man of experience, great yeeres, and well beloued; yet suppressed from aduancement, by reason Cuprax the sonne of the Duke of Pantalia, seemed a fauorite in Courte, and would haue drawne the managing of Martiall affayres to him selfe, had not Trezoboro by name entreated for Delano, and the Soldiers compelled out of their Country disclaimed any other.
                  
                     
BVt when Mengrelius vnderstood, that Anzitemus was come himselfe, a sodaine trembling disproportioned his former Courage, and the Oracle (like a hellish vision appearing) mightely perplexed him, and was indeed the author of strange courses, which at last ouerturned his good successe, yet he went orderly to worke, and encountred with the Armenians, before they were vnited to his sonns forces, who had much a doe to make their passage by reason the Boates were not yet come from Trezoboro, and Anzitemus had commaunded, that no man should lay violent Auzitemus ioyneth with Trezoboro: killeth Mengrelius, fulfilleth the Prophesie, &amp; inuesteth Trezoboro Emperor. handes on the Emperor, but this interception ended with the name of a skirmish: For Anzitemus with Delanos assistance quickely passed their Armie by a Bridge made of the Boates: and helped with great Furre-trees keeping equall distance of Twentie foote, and although the water was very broad; yet industry with the conueniencie of the place for woode, layed Plankes vpon the Beames, and so in one day both Horse and foote passed ouer in a manner within sight of the Enemie: For some two mile from the Riuer they had so entrenched the passages, that Mengrelius supposed they ment their to haue encamped, little thinking Delano played the Lapwing, who cryeth farthest from his Neast: and when he seemed most busie to fortefie a place of securytie, the maine Armie marched that night vnder a Woodes side to the Riuer,

and the next day put ouer, while the Trebizondians prepared against the Campe, which they supposed was so neere them: But being thus disappointed, they had liberty to complaine, but small meanes of reuenge, onely the Emperour vnited his Forces againe, and assured he was better prouided, determined to dally no longer, but put it to a triall; wherein if Fortune fayled, he was certaine to weaken the Aduersarie, and renew his owne Armie at pleasure; and so one day might affoord, what another did deny.
                  By this time is Anzitemus and Delano welcommed by the Prince, who hoping by course of pacification to end the Warre, sent to Mengrelius by faire intreaty not to conceiue so hardly of so worthy a sonne, and they would engage their Honor, he entended nothing but fayth and dutie: this message wrought no otherwise, then if Trezoboro would absolutely committe himselfe to his fathers tuition without hostage or other couenant, it might be the Emperor would forgiue him, to this Anzitemus opposed, yeelding many reasons, and by a second treatie vrged the burying vnder foote of all displeasures, the remission and restoring his followers, and the confirming him Heire apparant. Heere againe Mengrelius disdained to be abridged of his will, or courbed by his sonne &amp; subiects, whereupon defiance was proclaimed on all sids, and a day appoynted to entertaine destruction with solemnitie: at which time Anzitemus tryed another way to appease these mischeefes, by sommoning

the Armies to audience, and the Emperour to vnderstand, what must be trusted vnto. To this, the feare of the Souldiers, rather then his owne willingnesse, compelled him: and so Anzitemus in the front of his Armie thus deliuered his minde.
                  
                     I am not ignorant (great Emperour, and mis-led people) that Wisedome and good Counsaile are sometimes vnseasonable, especially in a time of fury &amp; hate amongst men of Warre, commaunded and countenanced by the Kings owne person; yet haue you no such cause either to put in armes these men, or Armed to make them butcher them selues: For though the Father fight there, the Sonne is not absent heere: though the elder Brother vnderstanding not the truth, is with Mengrelius, the younger attendes on Trezoboro: And though a Friend is enroulled with you, one of the Family is amongst vs: and were not this lamentable, though necessitie compelled it? But now to proceed with out order, ground, or reason, what scandall can be more opprobrious? What cause more detestable? All men haue written, that Violence continues not: yet haue you begun in the Cradle, and are not appeased after many yeares: and why? the Emperour is terrefied with an Oracle, and suspects his owne Children. Hath the Gods preserued them for this? Hath his Towardlinesse deserued this? Hath his Valloure in your late Broyles been shewed for this? Hath his Life been so often hazarded for this? Hath your Peace been wrought for this? Hath

your Prosperitie followed for this? Yea, hath Strangers been ashamed of the Composition; and the mighty Kalucki receiued him to fauour for this? And will now the Common-wealth teare her owne Bowels? the Members seeke their owne destruction by despising the Head; and the Father murder his owne Child? It is execrable and abhominable. But touching the Prophesie, to beleeue it not, what needeth this feare? To beleeue it, what way of preuention? But you will say, it is ambiguous. I reply, Malice must not misconsture, nor Wisedome be ouerruled with Supposes. For concerning the Prince, (by the Deuine power which ruleth all Princes) you can alleadge neither cause, reason, nor likelihood. How then haue you wronged your Renowne, and insorcered their Obedience? else would they neuer consent to destroy one another, to ruine their Countrey, make hauocke of their owne increases, see &amp; suffer mischiefe to knocke at their doores; and with the Giants fight against Heauen: or like that vnnaturall Bird, denowring them that hatcheth her; seeke to destroy the Successor, on whose safetie dependeth all their liues. Leaue off therefore for shame: leaue off; either yeeld a reason of your actions, or desist from your vnreasonablenesse? But you will answere, It is sufficient the Emperour commaundes. I doe say no; hee is but the Steward of the Gods, subiect to account; and ordained to forme, not dissolue the Common-wealth.
                  
                  
                     
But as a further vehemencle might haue agrauated the matter, the Souldiers began to repine, some demaunding whether the Prince raysed the Warre, or desired to saue him selfe? Some for what cause Mengrelius prosecuted his Sonne? Some stomaked to see intestine Dissipation. Some hardly beleeued the Prince began Innouation, considering he was to expect the Kingdomes to florish hereafter. Some said, though the Emperor were offended, the submission of a Sonne might appease any Father. Some absolutly denied to destroy the Prince, and the rest liked not, a wise man to be caryed away with dreames or deuises, especially when the ruine of the Empire must succeed: but Mengrelius enraged with this diuision exclamed only on dutie and alleageance threatning the reuolters with death, and attempting with stripes to terrefie diuers in the speed of escape, but it smally preuailed. For the greatest part fled a fore his face to his sonne, which Anzitemus tooke the aduantage of and encountered with the rest in sollemne manner of hostillitie, so that a terrible fight began, and a little time ouerlooked a dangerous conflict: in which the victory was a mournfull Triumph: For it ended with the cryes and teares of Orphanes for their Fathers, Fathers for their Children, Brother, for Brother, one Kinsman for another and freend for freend: yea such was the misery and mischiefe of the error amongst them, that a sonne was found mourning ouer a Carkasse, whom he

had slaine, and perceiuing it his owne father after a ruthfull complaint, kild himselfe: the horror of which sight, daunted the stoutest courage, and made them all cry out vpon the cause of their troubles; which Anzitemus tooke hold of, and knowing the Emperor had escaped (and as he afterward lernt) to Samarchanda with a quiet demeanor recalled them togeather, and though the Skirmish and their owne feares had disperced them farre off: yet handled he the matter so well, that they were contented to returne; and finding Trezoboro as sad for their greifes, as his owne misfortune, which by his Honorable protestations in the necessitie to saue his life, and vnwillingnesse to disquiet so good subiects, they saw apparant, in so much that vnkind teares brake off the Princely discourse: they shouted for ioy, and with a new Comicall applause sware, they would obey no other Emperor then Trezoboro: as for Mengrelius seeing his ill disposition had taught him the way to Tyranie, they sawe no reason to betray vertue, or be in subiection any longer to inhumanitie. Surely sayed Anzitemus, the Gods haue taken compassion vpon you, and you and we will now be one body, but of necessitie the body must haue a head, or else the Members perish, therefore we will inuest Trezoboro your Emperor, and he shall renew your peace and comfortes: This (as according to their owne desires) they soone consented to, and so in midst of all the Armie was he aduanced, inuested, and solemnly

proclaymed Emperour of Trebizond, and all the Mengrelius deposed and Trezoboro chosen Emperor. Kingdomes adioyning; Prince of Peace, Lord of the great Sea, and Seruant to the high Gods. Then sange they a Himne in his honour to Bellona, and a Song to Diana. And lastly, with Panegericall Ceremonies, they brought him to Mengrelius royall Tent, which the Souldiers had reuerently preserued in the defeat.
                  But when vnfortunate Peristoll (whom for his ill newes he commaunded to be slaine) had enformed the proceedings of the Campe, and that the Prince had taken vpon him the Diademne, neuer was impatience apter to be described: For now he raged indeed, and put in practise many actions of distemperature, as assuring him selfe the Oracle was compleat; onely the last poynt (which was his death) yeelded more terrour in the suspition, then a thousand mischiefes in full execution: Yet he lifted vp once againe the countenance of Valloure, and with his supply out of Russia, many Mercenaries from Scithia and Europa, and the rest, (worthy to be beloued for being true to their Maister,) hee set forward a mightier Armie then the first; which in short time confronted his Aduersaries, who were comming forward apace to take possession of the Citties: So that nothing was to be expected, but forcible and confused Prophanation both of loue and dutie; wherefore they gaue Reuenge full scope to make one day of death for all: And the Battaile began with a horrible and

impetuous violence, wherein to see the distempred Mengrelius with a well graced fury whirling amongst the troupes, would haue pittied his degenerating humors, and admired his strength and valoure; but Trezoboros approache deuided these thoughts, who finding the Emperour enclosed to his great danger contrary to expectation, commaunded them to desist, and so yeelded him freedome to worke his madnesse on some other subiect. An other time Anzitemus chaunced where destruction indeed was comming apace, and deliuered him: which hee tooke in greater scorne, because the Souldiers cryed, See the kindnesse of Trezoboro: see the pietie of Anzitemus. But this I say caryed him to disdaine indeed; and perceiuing him selfe spared by speciall appoyntment, hee changed his Horse and Armour, comming into the Battaile vnknowne, (For by this time, neither Order nor Discipline serued) and determined to single out his Sonne, with such a minde, as a man after a solemne Vow, which he is resolued to keepe, endeuoreth to bring to effect. But Anzitemus (hauing seene Perneades sequester him selfe from the company, with purpose to draw foorth such men as he prouided in ambush) supposed the Emperour had been hee, and so encountred with him before the sodaine approch might strike a feare amongst the wearied, and already fainting troopes; and after a gallant Battaile, Death rushed in with a blow, which the King with both his hands

stroke at his head, whose steely Couert not firmely setled, yeelded to the violence; shewing that nothing in the world is permanent, nor any man in life secure: so the Emperour shruncke vnder the burden of this misfortune, &amp; yeelded to an honorable vntimelines: Mengrelius slaine, and the Prophesie fulfilled. which was the more lamentable, because hee sought the destruction of his Sonne, and came to a ruthfull end by his Daughters husband.
                  But when Anzitemus had time to ouerlooke, and know it was Mengrelius, vnkinde remembrance confounded him with sorrow at the accident, and cursed the hand, that yet pleaded ignorance in the deed; remayning confounded, vntill the rumour and entercourse of people brought Trezoboro thither: at last came Calisthenes, Orchanes, Hardubax: at last came the rest; all more troubled with griefe, then proud of their owne quietnesse: so that the Victorie represented variety of Discomfort, rather then solemnity of a Triumph: For what with recording those many Vertues abounding in him, whereof euery one had bountifully participated; and the present spectacle so full of remorse, they sorrowed beyond measure, and Trezoboro was compelled to make his entrance into the Empire with incongruent demeanour, &amp; had celebrated (if the State would haue permitted it) with one solemnity his fathers Exequies, and his owne Coronation. By this time, was the Oracle published abrod, &amp; wisedome interdicted an vnmeasurable discomfort in a matter-remediles, &amp; appoynted ineuitable: so to make a nevv account with delight, Anzitemus was importuned to send for Brizaca, least she were altogeather

depriued of that benefite, (which Children receiue from the knowledge of their Parents.) This asked a litle time of deliberation: but the importunities of the Empresses preuailed; so the charge of the Iorney was committed to Philtranus Prince of Cilicia: As for the Army, he deuided that into two parts, sending the one by land vnder the command of Kazopletus; the other by Sea with Pelorus sonne of Pelorus, Artabazes Admirall: both to remaine vndissolued, till hee him selfe returned; in the meane while, his Mother Euphamia to rest Regent by a new Commission.
                  These matters had the effect of diligence and loyalty, &amp; Philtranus came fortunately into Armenia, &amp; informed the Queene of all occurrents, with the plausible directions for her progresse to Trebizond. Heere the intermixtion of contraries, kept her from the full entertainement of ioy; so that her Fathers Catastrophe extinguished the delight of her Brothers aduancement: to which an other home mischiefe was added, the returne of Cleonidas, who presuming on the absence of Anzitemus, and the Nauie vnder Pelorus, entred the Confines of Armenia, and attempted a ridiculous Innouation. But before we certifie this Aduenture, let vs see, how Fortune ouerlooked him in the danger after the Sea-fight with Anzitemus.
                  
                  BY that time, Cleonidas and Anzitemus (through The story of Cleonidas after the Battaile with Anzitemus. the effect of his diuelish reuenge) were deuided, and their Ships burnt and dismembred, the horrible lamentation of so many men so many wayes yeelding vp the last powers of their soules,

                        
stroke him to the heart, and (because his pestilent humour had no subiect to worke vpon) it boyld within him like a Furnace, ouerheating all the partes of his body and minde, so that he could haue been contented to haue made his owne seperation, considering a guilty Conscience laide open the records of so many faults: But euen when Death had been most beneficiall, the necessitie of Life, with the kindnesse of the impartiall element, draue the vnfirme Seate wheron he sate to another peece of a Shippe, from whence ouerburdned, hee saw fourteene cast into the Sea, as supposing it the nearest way to Heauen, through the reflexion the Heauens made in the Water: On this by great chaunce he got, and was tossed too and fro with the Billowes, as if Destruction meant to make a Game of his danger: at last after two dayes, hee was driuen on a sandie Iland not farre from the Continent of Persia; wherein he mused at his owne ignorance, that hauing so long time scowred all the coast of the Hircanian Sea, hee was yet vnacquainted with this place.
                  Heere a very instinct of Nature put him to his shiftes, and by striking two Flintes on certaine Reeds lying in the place, he shuffled vp a Fire; whose effects made the returne of warmth and strength, the maintainers of life: at which the inhabitants (who were onely Seruants and Officers attending on the Priestes heere liuing) wondred, who had presumed without order of Ceremony, to dishonour the place: For this was called the Iland of Fire, and had two Chappels therein; one dedicated to Vulcano, the other to the

                     Sanne; in which after the Persian manner, the Priestes were appoynted to liue, who onely had power to giue leaue to the Inhabitants to make their Fiers for necessities sake; which yet was not done without presence of a Religious man: Wherevpon they apprehended Cleonidas, and brought him to Sicambus the Archpriest in the same manner they found him: But when with an extraordinary courage in the Sirian language (because hee was to speake to a man of his profession) he discouered him selfe, and that Sicambus vnueiled his ignorance, remembring hee had seene him with Astiages in Persia, &amp; by many meanes heard of his fame, he comforted him the best hee could; but the best he could, preuented not a strange Sicknesse, which with an vnkind detention kept him full two yeares retiered, and confirmed their opinion, which supposed him perished: in the end, the firmenesse of his compleat manhood, and well seasoned body, ouermaistred the tiranny, and he recouered both in health and reformation: for after his penitency had protested a remorce of the action against Artabazes, and abiured his ill manner of life; the religious Father cheared him with the comfort, which followes true repentance, and by examples confirmed his willingnesse to amendment. Vpon this, they appoynted to goe into Persia, and accordingly ariued at Suziana much about the time Anzitemus fortunes were published through Asia; which he rather woondred, then stomaked at, not doubting to make his peace and reconsiliation, which his hope supposed by Zaloppos meanes (when the Persian Embassadours went to Armenia)
                     
to bring to passe: But their returne certified Anzitemus slight answere in that behalfe, and hee smothered the indignation for a time; but vnable to suppresse it, gaue Libertie at last, to burst foorth into flames of Despight, and in this manner proceeded.
                  Certaine summes of Mony disbursed for Astiages, he demaunded of the Queene Roxana: which awhile bred scruple and doubt, by reason of their Articles with Anzitemus and Artabanus; yet after a little debating, they were repayed with a plenary cancelling of all accounts: For being a matter chancing before this new Contract, and in her Fathers behalfe, shee thought it dishonorable to trifle him out with deuises or excuses. Many of his Souldiers setled in their Townes, which the hast of his busines permitted not to carry with him, he requested againe: This was left to their owne desires, because in this space maried, and brought vp amongst them, they would not seeme to banish them by compulsion: So the most of them louing Spoyles better then Pay, hasted to Cleonidas. With this Mony and this Supply, he departed to his owne Iland, and gathering his Friends and Confederats togeather, with fourty sayle of well appointed Ships, and fiftie Hulks for the transportation of his Army, he tooke the aduantage of the Kings absence in the Trebizondian Warres, and made speed for Armenia, landing his Forces at such time, as Kazopletus and Pelorus were returned from Anzitemus; and Philtranus came with directions to attende the Queene Brisaca to her Mother. But this they were ignorant of, and diuers vnsetled Humors, as idle persons,

and endangered to the Law; vpon the tumour of Cleonidas ariuall, to the number of foureteene thousand, made a head in nature of Particeans, and certified, they were ready, and resolued to ioyne with him; for their hearts and discontentments, had engaged them already; as if they meant to giue this notice, that in the best Hiue there be Drones and robbers of them that labour: but as their willingnes set them forward, their forwardnes puld them backe, as disordered without a Head, and hauing bad intelligence: For the vnlooktfor comming of Kazopletus ouertooke them with that speed, that Cleonidas had scarc notice, before the distraction dispersed and Iustice quickly scourged them all.
                  Thus was this fanaticall Company discomfited, and Cleonidas in a manner as soone ouerthrowne: For vpon report, how Mischance had put on a double visage against him, he made a retreat to his Ships; but ere he could house his men, Kazopletus by land, and Pelorus by Sea, had so hemnd him in, that though it prooued a gallant and tedious Skirmish, full of obseruation and example; yet his Fleete was suncke and dissipated, his Companies quite defeated, and him selfe taken prisoner, and sent to Sagarena, where Brizaca kept her Court; but shee vnwilling to proceed against him without directions from Anzitemus, by the counfaile of Euphamia, committed him to Ward in the same place, where his Father had once besiedged the beautious Artaxata.
                  
                  When Cleonidas saw him selfe thus disappoynted and captiued, and that the last Acte of his Tragedy was

in hand, to which the Gates of Shame and Death; or Death with the shame stood onely open, he made it a matter of some repining: yet as a man of excellent Resolution, hee neither seemed much dismayed, or abated: For to complaine of Godes, or Men, of Fortune, or the World, he thought it a property of such, as desired to liue. Againe, to crane pardone, sue to Friends, and make base Submission, hee imputed to such as feared to die; so that Death appeared now like a welcome Friend, if the reproch might be taken away, which made such an impression, that he protested Anzitemus should not triumph in his disgrace, not vse his liuing body contumeliously: yet when there seemed want of meanes to effect this glorious Acte (as hee supposed) beeing left destitute of all prouision, hee then boyled for very rage, and was enforced to coole him selfe with a Cup of cold Water; which working a better temperature, somewhat reduced him, and then he reprehended his dulnesse, that conceiued not the infinite wayes, whereat Death might make her entrance; wherevpon with circumspection (as if Desperatnesse meant to intreat her contrary aduise) hee searched about the Chamber, at last finding a rysing in the Wall, where a Flint shoued out his Corner, with a maine careere he dashed The death of Cleonidas. out his brairies, leauing rather example of Manhod, then Conscience.
                  With the death of Cleonidas, remayned Armenia fully quieted, and Brizaca without further suspition, might prepare for her progresse; to which the industry of Philiranus, and the dutie of her Subiectes

added outward Ritches and Pompe; nor was shee behinde them for State and Maiestie: So that shee set forward to their Ioy and Amazement from whence shee came, &amp; to their Delight &amp; Contentment, to whom shee went. But when Anzitemus vnderstood of Cleonidas death, hee tooke the newes (as it were in ill part,) because hee thought him selfe disappoynted of a great deale of Honour in the courses meant toward him: yet ballansing the assurance of his owne Peace and quietnes withall, hee gaue way to more seasonable desires, and seemed satisfied with the wantonnesse of the time, and the pleasure of the place, which delighted with varietie: so that if his owne importunities had not compelled his returne into Armenia, hee might very easily haue vsurped the felicitie of another Kingdome.
