            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            TO THE RIGHT EXCELENT and vertuous Lady, the Lady Anne Counteſſe of Warwicke: and to the right Noble, and worthie Ladie, my Ladie and Miſtriſſe, Katherine, Barones Howard of Eſſingham; and to the reſt of the illuſtrious Ladies of her ſacred Maieſties moſt Honourable priuie Chamber.
            
               IF in this Epiſtle, (Excellent Ladies) I containe not my ſtile within the bounds of breuitie, let the large ſcope which the fielde of your vertues proffereth, bee a ſufficient excuſe to my imputed blame: if in the courſe of the worke, which this Epiſtle preſenteth to your Patronage, multitude of errors haue beene ouerſlipped, yet I humbly beſeech it bee ſo much graced by your beautie, as what is good may bee acceptable vnto you, and my infirmities which are most may with all other (who bee they neuer ſo great, are or haue beene ſeruantes to ſome in your place) for your ſake lye couered, my weakneſſe beeing the more augmented, in that my pen is ſo meere a ſtraunger to my profeſsion, entertayning it onelye, and that rarelye to ouercome that Idlenes

of time, which to my ſelfe is ouer familiar, rather in waſt and void papers exerciſing the fame, then fit for any ende or purpoſe. Among which a few parcells haue 
                  ••
               ne Tranſlated by me ſome yeeres ſince vnſeene or vnthought of and had ſtil ſo continued, had J not (Noble Counteſſe) beene by thoſe which had full power ouer me otherwiſe enioyned. Wherein I haue ſooner choſen to eterniſe my own inſufficiencie, the render their perfections any waies vnſatisfied. And therfore haue made choice to publiſh theſe fower firſt Bookes by an vnknowne (without name, but a most iuſt and faithful) Author, at the firſt digeſted in a forren tongue, wherein J muſt needes yeelde to adde ſo much more to my owne vnperfectneſſe, as ſhall come within the view of your eyes, or ponder of your iudgement, as then receiuing moſt blemiſh, when you ſhall vouchſafe the Author in his owne and proper language: Who cannot in himſelfe but much ſatisfie ſuch is his ſtile, iudgement, truth and varietie of matter, wherein the minde of man moſt delighting, doth vndoubtedly couet Hiſtorie, before all other writinges, and if Hiſtorie what more pleaſing then is in him contained? So many euents and alterations diſcloſed; ſecret diſſeins, and intentions of mightie Princes reuealed; Emperours not enduring equalitie, Kings diſdained, ſwelling warres, treacherous truces, Popes practiſers, and triumphing in periuries, generall Councels diſauowed, Empires voluntarily reſigned, princes murthered, Crownes vſurped, Popes depoſed, Rome beſeaged, his holines and Cardinals in danger to be hunger ſtarued, deſcriptions of Citties, Townes, Caſtles and fortes, repreſentations of Royall armies, Inundations, Plagues, Earthquakes, famines, and other Gods wrathfull iudgementes, Sects and Sciſmes in hollie Churches, hot perſecutions, Religion made a Couerture to faction and ambition: the ſelfe ſame Kings at one inſtant proſecuting in their owne Realmes, what in perſon they

aſsiſted, and protected in the Empire; with the true cauſe, roote &amp; foundation of al the miſeries, which the ſtate of Chriſtendome at this day, and ſince fiftie yeares hath endured; vnder the diſcourſe of the French eſtate, ouerrunning al worthie occurents of Europe, Turkie, and America: A Hiſtorie though modern, &amp; familier to many now liuing Actors therein yet yeelding precedence, for matter, methode, knowledge and iudgment, to none, but thee triumphant Tacitus, ſacred Emperors lying ſubiect to thy pen, and the mightieſt Monarchy of the earth, to thy cenſure. As my poore trauailes (which moſt of all kept me from being willing to diuulge the ſame) obſcured by thy ſtately Sauile. Exquiſite Sauile honour to thy Vniuerſitie, though in thy vertue an enemy to me, ouerdropping and ſhadowing my endeuours, as the high broade Oke doth young and tender ſproutes, wrong not thy ſelfe and country with longer ſilence of thy pen, proude in thy Author, proude in thy Sainte, and not leaſt proude in the commender of thy worke, thy A. B. thy ſecret and haughtie Mecaenas, diſguiſed in the two firſt letters, the whole Alphabet not being enough to ſet foorth his worthe, but he may not ſo eſcape in a ſhaddowe, his eloquence diſcouereth his Arte, his iudgement his experience, and his experience (in hauing aſſaulted the dreadfullſt Monarch of our world, to the verie gates of his chiefeſt Cittie,) hath confirmed his valour, to his neuer dying glorie. But how much the more naked I ſtande frustrate of countenance, ſubiect to errors, &amp; ſo thorough error to reprofe, (as whatſoeuer is mine can be no other worth, ſo much more (high and worthie Counteſſe) doth the power of your patronage in my protection, extend it ſelfe, and the grace of your fauor in vouchſafing the reading of this worke vnworthie only by my owne vnableneſſe, to ſet it forth vnto you like it ſelfe. The ſubiect whereof, though loftie in mannaging the glorious actions of anointed Soueraignes, and repreſenting

the fierce exploits of vnmercifull and bloudy warres, can no waies yet be ſtrange, or diſſonant to your eares, daughter to ſo great an Earle of Bedford, graue Councellor, commander and gouernour, ſometimes of that Royall towne and Garriſon, which bordereth on the Scottiſh ſoyle: and deare wife to that redoubted Ambroſe, Earle of Warwicke, expert and faithfull Councellor, (Sonne to ſo puiſſant and Magnanimious a Duke) his name, his fame, his valor reſounding in foraine Regions, while he had the honour to bee commaunder and Lieutenant generall ouer a Royall Engliſh armie, by your birth and Marriage ſeeming to be choſen, and conſecrated to Mars himſelfe, happie in father, more happie in husband, but moſt happie in your Soueraignes grace, ornament of her Courte, true patterne of pietie, deuotion, charitie and vertue.
            And you (Excellent Miſtriſſe) to whome as well for your honour, bountie and fauours, my fruites and Labours are most due; as hauing firſt vndertaken the ſame, eating of your bread, vouchſafe your Patronage, &amp; diſdaine not my Authors Engliſh weede, who preſenteth his attendance vpon your Perſon, at ſuch time as wearied with other occaſions, you are accuſtomed to retire your ſelfe to your Bookes and Muſes. Ʋerified is that in you, that neuer, Les alone; then when moſt alone, for the more part ſpending your vacation of time, either in Meditation of holie letter, or conference and reading of ſome notable and famous Hiſtorie, which whether it treate of peace, pollicie, war, or martiall exploits, can hardly diſcouer ought, new or ſtrange vnto your wiſedome, the one by your high place, long ſeruices, and Courtelie conuerſation, made familiar vnto you, the other by nothing more, then the ſignall acts, and heroicall prowes of Magnanimious and victorious Charles, your Lo. and husband, true patriot, carefull Councellor, vigilant commaunder, rightlie and

iustly deere to his Soueraigne and Countrie, dreadfull to the enemie, terror to traytors, and ſcourge of Spaniſh Monarchie, which the defeate of that inuincible army, (for ſo in Print thē
               ſeues publiſhed) can beſt teſtifie, the glorie whereof can not but ſtirre vp thoſe two young Jmpes of great hope and expectation, (ouer whome you haue euer beene a carefull Cornelia) as well to ſucceede their renowmed Father, in his vertues (which neuer ſhal periſh) as other his humaine dignities &amp; poſſeſsions; wherof if you ſhall not in this Hiſtorie haue the like profered to your view, (for no age hath left any ſuch recorde) yet cōtemne not the reading of my Author, by whome you ſhall receiue the true firſt motiue of all the Ciuil and foraine warres of Fraunce in our age, and her neighbour Countries: with ſuch memorable accidents and occurents, as continually were ministred. Not like to that impudent, though excellent writer, Paulus Iouius, no leſſe worthy to be a Biſhoppe, then a Hiſtoriographer, who plainly auerred, nay was not aſhamed himſelfe in his Bookes to vaunt, how he made no accounte in writing a lie, were it in matter of conſequence, or to pleaſe the appetite of great ones, which ſhoulde ſet him a worke: for that wher ther was one in his time, which knew the fault from the truth, all poſterity hereafter would notwithſtanding belieue and giue credite to what he ſhould ſet down, my Author contrariwiſe, hath beene ſo little tickled with the couet of rewarde or ambition (capitall enemies to the truth) as that he refuſeth to ſet his owne name to his ſo painefull labours, mildely and with ſuch great temperance ouerrunning the proceedings of all enemies, as hee cannot iustly be ſuſpected of any partiall leaning to the one ſide more then the other, wiſhing for my own part that ſome one ther were (according to my taſt giuen) who in this ſcribling age (whereof tranſlating humours and quoters are plentie) would finiſh out the reſt, many fragments and ſundrie

Bookes yet lying by me (as I once intended, but ſince, through an accident that happened) in a pelt flong away my pen, confining what I had done, (as I then thought) to vtter darkeneſſe, weary of giuing Liueries to other mens retayners, like a conceyted builder, rather delighted with an inferiour model of his owne framing, then to rough-caſt, or adorne a more goodly and ſumptuous pallace left vnto his hands, reſeruing my ſelfe to ſomwhat (though ſimplier) of my owne hammering and digeſting, which the proiect already being fauſied, time may finiſh and peraduenture bring to light, if feare of receiuing foyle by that illuſtrious Camden, doe not otherwiſe withdrawe my humorfoyle, yet honour enough to be an imitator, and carrier of thy Bookes, (Precious &amp; curious Camden) thy owne Country prints not ſufficient to extend thy name, worthy to finde Kinges thy nurcing fathers, and Queenes thy nurſes; rare Iewell of Britaine land, enemie to inglorious obliuion, treſurer of memorie, trumpet of Albyons fame, register of Antiquitie and pourſiuant of eternitie.
            It now reſteth (glorious and beautifull Ladies) adorned with your ſtately ranke and place, humbly to interceſſe pardon for my preſumption in ſeeking ſo boldely to ſhrowde the infirmities of my pen, vnder the ſhadowe of your winges. And that it will pleaſe you to grace with your generall ſafe conduct this my newe Engliſh Denizen to paſse from place to place, (free from any Menippean ſearch) vntill he may make his rende-uous in ſome contemplatiue, or retired hands, who though he now ſeeme Clowniſh &amp; Rogiſh like, yet notwithstāding in his own Country guiſe, is well eſteemed of, &amp; very commendable. In which albeit many of you bee ſingularly well able to iudge of him, yet if it pleaſe any of the rest, to vouchſafe to entertayne his broken Engliſh, I dare aſſure that for his diſcourſe, you ſhall finde him very

delightfull, for his newes not ordinarie, and for his truth can bring good ſecuritie, when ſoeuer he may be permitted to attend vpon your leaſure, not importioning his acceſſe, vntill weried with your more weightie and ſerious ſeruices, a deſire may poſſeſſe you, inſteede of recreation, to ſpend with him ſome fewe howers of the day. A matter heretofore accuſtomed (in my knowledge) by manie high and loftie Ladies, who often times to be meete with weariſomnes, exerciſed themſelues in studie, &amp; reading of worthie writers, as Marguerite Counteſſe of Lennox, Anne Counteſſe of Oxford, Francis Counteſſe of Suſſex, Elizabeth Counteſſe of Lincolne, the Ladie Marie Sydney (liuing my thrice honoured miſtreſſe) truely liberall and bountifull, rare Mother of ſo heroicall an ofſpring, by her noble minde and cariage eaſily diſcouering greatnes of birth and Princely parentage; and that wiſe good, and godly Ladie aduancer of ſo many excellent perſonages, both in Arte and Armes, employing her credite with her Soueraigne, (then whome none had greater) in doing good offices, for all ſortes in generall, but eſpecially preferring thoſe, in whome ſhe might perceiue any ſignification of vertue to appeare. That graue Matron, harmeleſse Courtier, and faithfull ſeruant Francis Barones of Cobham, (late wife to the noble L. and truſtie Councellor yet liuing) to whome I was ſo much bound (in many duties being likewiſe to the whole houſe) as that both in her health and languiſhing Maladie, ſhe ſundrie times admitted me, to conferre or reade with her, finding in the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtorie her moſt delight. But no waies may I heere without extreame note of groſſe ouerſight pretermit in this lift, that famous Religious and learned Ladie (flower of her familie,) prouident mother, bleſſed in her poſteritie, Mildred Barones of Burghlie, beſides her knowledge in the Latine letters, (wherein of a ſubiect ſhe excelled) ſuch were her ſtudies, exerciſes,

and continuall Meditation in the Greeke Doctors of the Church, (eſpecially Baſil, Ciril, Chriſoſtome and Nazianzene,) as a chiefe reader in that tonge (Laurence by name) hath ere now confeſſed vnto me, that in his iudgemēt ſhe Egalled if not ouermatched any, in whoſe profeſsion (as expected ſo) moſt was to be required. Neither were theſe excellent parts of hers, onely Theoricall, but ſtill put in practiſe like an other Dorcas, full of piety and good works, as without any ostentation or 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , beſides her readines in ſolliciting for poore and diſtreſſed ſutors vnto her deare Lo. (the auncients Councellor of Europe, Pater Patriae, piller of the ſtate, thorough whoſe prudent pollicie, and carefull watchings iuſtly may be applied, Neque periculum in R. P. fuit grauius unquam, noc maius otium) in her life time ſetting on her owne charge ſo many poore aworke, her exhitition to Schollers, liberallitie to Vniuerſities, bountie to exiled ſtrangers, and her most abounding charitie euerie quarter to all the priſons about London hath manifeſtly declared; I hope that in ſo long inſiſting vpon the vertues of this Lady and others, I ſhall not be miſliked, for inſinuation, leſſe feare to be ſuſpected, nameleſſe like my Author and yet if knowne moſt will confirme, that Non mihi promptum in adulationes ingenium. But I haue the rather preſumed of your patience, in delighting of theſe honourable perſonages, to the end to incite you to treade in their ſteps, and imitate their examples. Such as you are, were they, and ſuch as they now are, ſhall euerie one of you be, who though they ſeeme faded, and as it were vaniſhed from among vs, yet doth their goodneſſe, and memorie ſtil remaine freſh and fixed in the minds and harts of manie.
            But how can it otherwiſe fare (Illuſtrious Ladies) but that you must needes ſucceede, or rather abounde in all or greater worthineſſe hauing the honour and bliſſe to bee trayned vpp,

in the ſame Schoole, from the which they (and all other) borrow their light as the Moone doth frō the Sun, at the mouth of that diuine Oracle, Ex cuius ore, melle dulcior fluit oratio, that ſacred Queene, vnmachable and victorious Ʋirgine, Supereminens omnes, Mans mirror, Ioues darling, worlds wonder, and natures perfection, whoſe Angelicall face ſo often as I doe beholde, (as behold to often I can not) me thinketh J ſtill (with daſeled eyes) ſee as it were in full aſpect Solarem Maieſtatem, cum Saturnina grauitate.
            
            That the powerful and eſſentiall thing of things, may number the peaceable yeeres of her Raigne like the ſands of the Sea, that the ſhadow gonne downe in the Dyall of Ahaz, may be ten and ten degrees brought backward, that the Sunne abide, and the Moone ſtand ſtill, vntill ſhe may be auenged of her enemies. Let all her Subiects pray, our age reſt thankefull, poſteritie admire, and the heauens eterniſe her name for euer.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            The Hiſtorie of Fraunce.
            THE FIRST BOOKE.
            
               NOw that thoſe our Actions are moſt worthy of praiſe, which can both pleaſe &amp; profit together, wherein a Hiſtory ought to haue the aduantage to excell all other, I do not wel know, &amp; though I did, hardly could I tell, whether in repreſenting vnto you the eſtate of Fraunce, and nations neighbours vnto it, ſince fortye yeeres paſt I might doe a generall pleaſure, conſidering the mallice, enuye, and diuerſitie of iudgements of euery man. True it is, that if I be not deceiued through the ſelfe liking of my owne labour, the truth herein ſo clearely repreſented, the free deſire of euery ones profit in ſundry ſortes, the varietie and notable euente of ſo many accidents doe ſufficiently promiſe vnto mee a gratious acceptance, euen at the handes of the more gentle and better vnderſtanding ſort of ſtrangers, who being farre from my knowledge, and thereby leſſe tickled with enuie, (an ordinary compagnion of the liuing) ſhall be more rightly able to iudge of my labours. I doe leſſe doubt, how ſmall or much pleaſing ſoeuer the firſt Treatiſes of this Hiſtorie ſhal be, but that all wil euen haſten to ſee the progreſſe and iſſue therof, ſome allured thereunto through the pleaſure, which the diuerſitie of ſo ſtrange and memorable an Argument offereth vnto them, and other of a curioſitye praiſe worthie, to be willing to know the meruailes of Gods iudgments, the great hatreds and ſmall charitie: So many peaces broken, ſo many warres renewed, ſo ſtrange cruelties, ſo ſmall fauours: in ſumme al the Potentates of chriſtendom at banding for, and againſt the French, who moſt miſerably haue made themſelues the foole in the play, and the vnhappy end &amp; variable reencounter of more rare miſeries, then euer worldlings did practiſe. I cleane contrarye knowing the verye cauſes and meanes through which wee haue beene cunningly ledde to ſuch pouertye, endeuour as much as poſsibly I may, to eſtrange from my ſelfe the conſideration of ſo miſerable effects, and fetch my hiſtory from more high, reaching ſomewhat beyond the beginning of our ciuill warres, where wandring in a true diſcourſe of forraine affaires, and ſuch as are common vnto vs, with our neighbours; I ſeeke the recompence of my paines. In this chiefely that as maiſter of my ſelfe, I cōmand my owne affections for a

while, to forget our calamities paſſed, from which I may boldely borrow ſo much leaſure as I ſhall eſteeme neceſſarie, to turne awaye for a ſeaſon ſo ſorrowfull and pitious a remembrance, as thereby I am howrely put in minde of: and albeit the memory of ſuch greefes ought not any wayes to cauſe a vertuous diſpoſition to ſwarue from the truth, no more then the frendſhip of ſome, hatred of other, or reſpect of great perſonages ſhould doe, and though hee is verye rarelye to be found, which is not ſpyed in the ende: if not throughlye gained, yet at the leaſt tempted by ſome one of theſe paſſions, eſpecially in ſo confuſe, graue, and deepe a matter: I will notwithſtanding be found ſo little partiall as all men ſhall haue more cauſe in other matters to diſgrace me, then in the truth of ſuch accidents as are heere ſet foorth: which if they ſhal bring a form of a more agreeable ſetting forth, either by the number of ſtrange occurrents, or exceeding by a more excellency of deliuery, the rudenes of my naturall language: howſoeuer it be, ſo farre am I from enuying ſo great a benefite to thoſe of my age, that I ſhall holde my ſelfe for well ſatisfied, when I ſhall not gather any other profite of my long watchings, then to ſee my ſelfe at the end of ſo great trauailes, to haue vndertaken more for the pleaſure of others, then my owne particular. And now that among Hiſtoriographers my name reſteth as obſcured, their high valour &amp; number which are able to ſhadow the light, wil bring me ſome comfort: ioyned therewithall is, that my qualitie holding more of action then of contemplation, doth diſpence with me to make any profeſsion of writing, but in matter of conſequence wherein I am moſt delighted: which being the cauſe that I beſt iudge of my inſufficiency: for being able to conduct and profit ſo labourſome a trauaile, I will call vpon his grace which is able to bleſſe the beginning, purſuite, and laſt end of ſuch a labour.
            Being then reſolued to lay before your eyes the eſtate of Fraunce and her neighbours ſince fortye peares paſſed, and conſidering how the cauſes of humaine accidents are maintained by an eternall bonde, and knowne of fewe people, I thought I ſhould make my worke a great deale more commendable, if I did fetch the matter from more high, thogh not from the firſt ſpring, yet at the leaſt from the more apparāt occaſions which haue brought forth ſo ſtrange occurrents. For when I ſhould entreat but of the wars between Charles the Emperour, and Philip his ſonne, againſt the Kings of Fraunce, or of the change of Religion throughout Chriſtendome, or of the Seditions that enſued thereon, I ſhould worke you very ſmall pleaſure and leſſe profit, in laying downe theſe matters ſo rawly vnto you, leauing in the meane time vndiſcouered, the roote and cauſe of theſe great ones enmities: the beginning and progreſſe of the reformation, the paines and purſuites againſt ſuch as were wilfull in the faith, when, whence, and how the Lutherans were diſperſed throughout the whole world, by what meanes and ſucceſſe they haue beene maintained againſt the Catholiques in euery Countrie: together with the motife and conduite which both the one and the other pretended to bring, to the defence of the true and auncient religion. And hereby in ſhewing you the beginnings and preparatiues of the ſtomacking warres among the Chriſtians, I ſhall make you to iudge how the moſt notable broyle which euer was ſeene in Chriſtendome, had his beginning from the diuerſities of opinions, in the explanation of the religion of our Fathers. To the maintenance of which, the perſecutions which were ordained and purſued againſt the more ſtedfaſt in their faith, haue brought forth leſſe troubles in all ſortes of vertues, but much greater be it in quantitye or qualitie of vices, yea ſurpaſsing all misfortune, number, and varietie of notable accidents, all the warres which euer our anceſtours had againſt their neighbours: as the narration of the pittifull effectes both of the one and th'other

worldly paſſion ſhall make apparant vnto you, if you will patiently abide the reading thereof vntill the end.
            The peace which was concluded between Charles 5. Emperour,The ſtate of Fraunce and countries adioyning from the yeere 1544. and Frauncis the firſt, togither with that which enſued at Ardres betweene Henry 8. K. of England, and the K. of Fraunce, maintained as well the eſtates and ſubiects of theſe Princes, as of ſundry other Chriſtians which by alliance, neighbourhood, or other dutie of frendſhip communicated with their paſsions, in ſuch reſt and aduantage, as all eſteemed themſelues happie of their preſent eaſe, conſidering their toyles paſſed: euery one reioyſing ſo much more, as hauing ſuffered a world of miſeries, vnder the continuance of ſo long and cruell warres, they had euen fully perſwaded themſelues that the immortall hatreds of their Soueraignes, would vtterly enuy the comming of ſo greatly a deſired peace: ledde hereunto, for that finding their harte burnes grounded vpon a ſlight enough deſpite, yea more ambitious then reaſonable, they often enough ſawe them counſelled by thoſe, who hauing nought elſe thē their Maiſters pleaſure &amp; their owne particular before their eyes, repreſented vnto them but an apparance of good:The beginning of wars and miſeries among chriſtians. the purſuite whereof being alwaies vnfortunate to ſubiects, brought only honor and profit, to ſuch as full cunningly knew how to make their owne markets. But ſuch was the eternall prouidence, or to ſpeake naturally, the vndiſcreet lightnes of the French, ioyned with a too vaine ambition of their neighbours, drawing from ſo euill guided a paſsion, a lamentable ſpring of all our miſeries to come, that ſo yong a peace could not be ſuffered to wax old among the Chriſtians, who too tickliſh in their eaſe, &amp; as it were leaping with a deſire of new chāges, ſeemed to ſeek nothing elſe thē an occaſion how to free thēſelues from this reſt, which alredy ſeemed too noiſome vnto thē. Now as according to the infinite reencounter of humaine accidents, they could not long want matter to entertaine the fire of their ancient enmities, the occurrence of the protection of Parma preſented it ſelfe but too ſoone to heate the well neere tempered affections of theſe Princes, of their people and allies, by a new motion which ſo greatly changed their counſailors harts, not yet ful cooled of their burning enmities, that there needed no long time to perſwade them to make warne, and fall together by the eares with greater ſtomack then euer. Beholde the very cheefe occaſions.
            The ancient hatreds between the Spaniards and French, grounded vpon the pretence of Naples, Milan, Flaunders, Burgundie,Warres begun between the French and Spaniſh. and ſundry other rights (for the maintenance wherof ſo much Chriſtian bloud hath bene ſhed) reuiued between Frauncis the firſt, &amp; Charles of Auſtria, &amp; continued for light enough occaſions, were no leſſe entertained through the enuy of the glory which the French atchieued, at the memorable defeat of (at their times) the inuincible Swiſsers at Marignan, the conqueſt of Milan, and ſundry other great aduantages happened to the Flowredeluce, then the ielouſie of the honor and and aduancement, which Charles got at ſuch time as the ſeauen Electors of Germany beſtowed vpon him (to be meete with the French) the title and ſoueraigne power of Emperour ouer the Chriſtians: and ſince being tooth and nayle purſued by the ambitious and ſturdie nature of theſe two, though yong, yet the greateſt Princes of Chriſtendome, there euer fell out ſuch ſtore of matter to nouriſh this fire of enmitie, that one could not but iudge it eternall, if Charles had not firſt ſhewed both to the Princes of his owne time and to come, as well by his ſucceſſion to the goods and rights of his anceſtors, as by his voluntary reſignation of his eſtates, and free retreate into a ſolitary life voide of the pranckes of this worlde, how one ought to take and leaue hatreds, rather with diſcretion then blinde paſſion or aduiſe of euil councellors, into which almoſt all Lords, by indiſcretion, faintnes of hart,

or other inſufficiencie, ſuffer themſelues to be but too much ledde. Charles notwithſtanding was cunning,The nature of Charles 5. a diſſembler, a great husband as well in the expence of his time, as treaſure, patient, ſtaide and well ſetled, couragious in aduerſitie, diſcreat in his wordes and actions, of a good and ſtrong ſtature, ſcorning the outward gloryes and ſhewes of the worlde, hauing for counterpeaſe of his good partes, the indiſpoſition of his perſon, ſelfe will in his own opinion, and the wealth of his eſtate for the end of his actions, more then reaſon, honor or iuſtice, what euer could be alleadged vnto him to the contrary. Frauncis on the other ſide was open, too bountifull, ſumptuous in diet,The nature of Frauncis 1. apparell, buildings, and other outward things, royall in perfourmance of his worde, valiant, couragious, a great freend to learning and other rare matters, but blemiſhing his praiſe-worthy partes with too ſuddaine a change of opinion, and and too free credite giuing to ſuch as he had lightly enough choſen for his cheefe fauourites, no leſſe then by worldlye pleaſure, which carrying him to the fruition of things corporall and fleſhly, ſhortned the courſe of his life, which otherwiſe could not chuſe but haue beene very long; conſidering the eſtate of his perſon, and a reaſonable good forme of dyet which hee helde by the aduiſe of his Phiſitions. Both of them freends to the people, whom they would not ouercharge but in great neceſsitie, couragious, ambitious, yea to haue imagined eche one in their owne conceite, to haue had the Empire of the worlde, alike frended of Fortune, if you compare the loſſes which Charles ſuſtained at Metz, in Fraunce, in Affricque, and elſ-where, with the impriſonment of Erauncis, they both left their children heires to ſome of their vertues, as well as of their wealth and paſsions: but much ſurpaſsing them in yeelding credit to their counſellors, to whome they meerelye referred the reſolution of good or bad, which ſometimes they too much put in practiſe for their owne particular, as well as for the good of the eſtate. Of which leauing vnto the hiſtorie to diſcouer the ouer-plus vnto you, I will but deliuer the matter of Parma, which reuiuing their halfe dead contrariety of affections, ſeemed vnto them a ſufficient occaſion and fit meanes to be throughly reuenged of whatſoeuer had bene before paſſed.
            Pope Paul 3. had exchanged certain of the church lands, by the conſent and ratification of the Colledge of Cardinals, with Parma and Plaiſance, in which he inueſted his ſonne Pierre Loys Farneze, and in the end obtained the Emperours conſent (for that in time paſt they had appertained to the Dutchie of Milan:) Vpon condition of ſome recompence, and the marriage of his naturall daughter with Octauian, eldeſt ſonne to Pierre Louys. Who imagining to aſſure the inſolences of his fraile and arrogant life, thorough the rigorous carriage of himſelfe, and his ſtrong fortreſſes which he there built, eſpecially at Plaiſance, was notwithſtanding in the end ſtabbed in with a Dagger, by the Paluoyſins his Subiects and others as he ſate at dinner. But ſhortly after Ferdinande Gonzague Lieutenant for the Emperour in the Dutchie of Milan was readie to enter, both with horſe and foote to ſeaſe of Plaiſance to the vſe of the Emperour, which made men to thinke that he fauoured the plat: So the Pope greatly offended as wel at the loſſe of his ſonne, as of his lands, and eſpecially by him who had beene ſo greatly benefited, by him and his houſe, to which he was himſelfe alied, found no more ready way for the defence of the reſt (knowing that a number of the countrie about Parma yeelded day by day to Gonzague, and others for the Emperour) then to ſend Camillo Vrſino,
               Paul 3. dieth. Iuly 3. choſen Pope. one of the Captaines of the Church to Parma: being himſelfe cleane worne with age, his end the rather haſtened by ſo ſorrowfull newes: And ſeeing himſelfe euen ready to depart, ordained by his will that Parma ſhould be rendred to his grand childe Octauian, the which was confirmed by Ialie the

third, before Cardinal of Mont-Aretin, choſen Pope after certaine defferents which had paſſed in the conclaue, commaunding Camillo to deliuer vnto him the Cittie which he did. Notwithſtanding, that the Emperour had earneſtly required him to deliuer it into his handes as Protector of the ſubſtance of the Church,The meanes which Charls the Emperour vſed to get Parma. and beſides as Lord of Millane, from whēce theſe places had bene diſmembred, declaring vnto him the great charge of expence conuenient for the tuition thereof; yea proceeding ſo farre as to threaten Camillo if he did not deliuer it. And ſeeing he could not by theſe meanes obtaine it, he offered high rewards to Octauian, who notwithſtanding vtterly deſpiſed them, fearing like ſundrie other he ſhould become cleane fruſtrate as wel of his certaintie, as his hope. The Pope for all that deepely preſſed in the end thorough the ſolliciting of the Emperour, ſignified vnto Octauian that he would no longer ſuſtaine the expence which hee had promiſed towards the protection of his dominions. Whereupon, he being greatly aſtonied, eſpecially for that the other ſeemed cleane to forget himſelfe, hauing receiued his firſt aduancement from the houſe of Farneze, and conſidering that his father in law indeuored but his ſpoyle, in the end beſought the King of Fraunce to receiue him vnder his protection: Who being perſwaded that the action was worthy of commiſeration, and that by the example of his anceſtors, he ought to ſhew himſelf therin ready to ſuccour the afflicted, &amp; aboue all things a protector of the goods of the Church: firſt comforted him with a hope of ſuccour, and not being able to bring the Pope to take vp the matter otherwiſe, he vndertook the defence therof vpon fauourable conditions, to the Church of Rome:The King of Fraunce taketh Octauian Farneze &amp; Parma into his protection. ſo as the French entred there very ſhortly after, which the Emperour tooke in very euill parte, attributing it to a meere and wilfull breache of Peace ſo ſolemnelye concluded. The K. notwithſtanding to make manifeſt his entente herein, which he foreſawe would bee euill conſtrued of ſuch as were ignorant of his meaning, and chiefely to put out of euery mans head ſuch reproches and backbitinges, as by his enemyes might be ſuppoſed, that he ſhould haue a further end then he would diſcouer, made knowne to all men by two ſeuerall waies, that banding himſelfe againſt the Pope and his partakers, he would not be ſeperate in ought might appertain to the vnion of the church of Rome: firſt by the perſecution which he was counſelled to ſharpen &amp; double againſt the Lutheranes, ſecondly, by his proteſtations which of his own deliberation he ſent, as wel to the counſel of Trent as dietts, of th'emperour and other chriſtian princes: touching the firſt he preſently made a moſt ſure teſtimonie thereof, to ſuch as cheeflie deſired his enmitie with the Pope, and banding againſt the Chatholick obedience, for vpon the complaint which the Cleargy made vnto him of the vnbrideled companie of Lutheranes, which encreaſed to a great eye-ſore throughout his Realme, he cauſed a maruellous rigorous Edict to be made for their ſearching out, reuealing, condemnation and puniſhment. The which being made at Chaſteau-Briant where then he was, the 27. of Iune 1551. was called the Edict of Chaſteau-Briant: by vertue whereof all the ancient Edicts which puniſhed Heretiques were reuiued and made in force; the ſoueraigne knowledge giuen to the Preſidiaux, to the end to make ſpeedie expedition, and among ſundry other articles for the puniſhing of Printers, Booke-binders, and other ſellers of ſuſpected bookes, it was enacted that the Eſtates of Iudicature thereto ordeyned, and Regentes of Schooles ſhould bee bound to bring proofe to witneſſe that they were well reputed of among good Catholicke Chriſtians: that information ſhould be made againſt the negligence of ſuch Iudges as ſlacked their puniſhment from three moneths to three moneths, that the Mercuriales ſhould be in force in ſoueraigne Courtes, in which ſhould be chiefelye

handled the points of faith, eſpeciallye for the purging of ſuch faultes as might be found in any ſuſpected of hereſie, whereof hee will'd information ſhould bee made: the goods of heretiques retired to Geneua, to be confiſcate to the King, except good proofe were made that they were ſimplie bought: togither with ſundry other rigorous articles. Now for that to the end the eſtate of Fraunce might be the better aſſured and maintained, the Kings at all times haue beene contented to yeelde this authoritie to that Parlament of Paris (being aſſembled of the moſt remarqued Frenchmen, for their knowledge, experience and other vertues, as well Clergie as Layetie) to iudge whether the letters, ſtatutes, Edicts, and ordinances, although they were before reſolued of by the Priuie counſell, were fit to be put in practiſe throughout the Realme, to the end they ſhould be either receiued, publiſhed, and engroſſed of record in their Courte, or ſent backe againe to the King if they were not found iuſt, reaſonable, and aduantagious to the eſtate: together with their declarations which they muſt ſend both in writing and worde of mouth, by ſome one of their owne body, which to that purpoſe they diſpatch. The Edict was preſently carryed to the Kinges Counſell (which are his Proctor and 2. Aduocates ordained for his aſsiſtance) at the earneſt ſute of the Clergie, requiring to haue it engroſſed of record in the Court, but it was refuſed for many conſiderations, which a number of Counſellers alleadged, that at that time ſtoode ſuſpected, and ſince found to bee Lutherans, as heereafter I will declare. In the end notwithſtāding by the earneſt and continuall inſtance of the Cardinals and other of the Cleargie about the King, who beſides would make him ſelfe appeare moſt Chriſtian throughout all Europe, eſpecially for the reaſons aboue mencioned,Religion well maintained preſerueth all eſtates. the Court was ſo preſſed, that all the articles of the Edict were there in publique audience read, the 3. of September 1551. in the Chamber called Doree. Of all which Pierre Seguier the Kings Aduocate, demaunding the ingroſsing of the behalfe of the Proctor generall, ſaide that it was well knowne how the Kinges of Fraunce had bene alwaies zealous protectors of chriſtianitie, of the faith and vnion of the Church, for which they worthily deſerued the name of moſt Chriſtian: that there was no doubt but zeale of Religion was one of the principall cauſes, for which it pleaſed God to maintaine the eſtate of that Realme in that greatnes it was vntill that day, that hiſtoryes did witnes, among all the misfortunes and vnhappines which fell out betweene the Romaine Kings, the raigne of Numa Pompilius to haue beene found moſt long, happie and peaceable, becauſe hee was moſt zealous in Religion. And Titus Liuius and Plutarch write, Quod Numa Primus condidit templum fidei: primus fidei ſolemne inſtituit. And albeit that the Religion of Numa was not ruled after the worde of God, yet hauing had ſo great an increaſe of good fortune in his Heatheniſhe Religion, it may verye well cauſe vs to thinke that the care and zeale which the Kings of Fraunce haue had for Chriſtian religion, hath greatlye auailed and helped towards the maintenance and enlarging of the Monarchie of Fraunce. Contrarywiſe negligence of Religion, the leauing and apoſtacie of faith, and the ſciſmes and diuiſions in the Church, are the beginning and ſpring of all miſchiefes, and the forewarning of deſolation and ruine to a Common-wealth. The examples are verye common De neglecta Religione, both in Valerius and other our owne Hiſtories, as the Bookes of Moſes doe teſtifie, that the children of Iſrael, while they helde themſelues vnited in the faith of God, and precepts of Moſes, proſpered and ouercame all aduerſities, but when they withdrew themſelues from religion, they fell into great ruine. The moſt Chriſtian King conſidering and well vnderſtanding theſe things, hath ſtudiouſly &amp; diligently ſearched by all poſsible meanes, how the error of the Pſeudo-chriſtians
               
might bee extermined, and cleane rooted out of this Realme, and to this end hath commaunded theſe letters now read, to be approued in this Courte: and further ſaid that he could not omit to yeelde due thankes vnto the King for his moſt gracious, royall, and moſt Chriſtian will, moſte humblye beſeeching God that it would pleaſe him to preſerue the King in this charitie, deuotion and zeale, many yeares, and hereupon concluded, and required the publication and approuing of the letters, enioyning the Prelates and Cleargy in what appertained to their charge, to obey the contents thereof. Then the Preſidente after the counſellers had deliuered their opinions, gaue this ſentence. The Court in obeying of the Kings will, ordaineth that vpon the plight of the ſaid letters ſhalbe ſet downe, Lecta, publicata &amp; Regiſtrata, audito &amp; requirente procuratore generale Regis, and that the Iudges Preſidiaux, and ſuch as aſſiſt them in iudgement of criminall enditementes, ſhall vpon ſight thereof cauſe the priſoners to be brought before them and heare them ſpeake in perſon, and ſuch iudgements as ſhall be ſo giuen by the Preſidiaux and their aſsiſtantes, ſhall not be helde and reputed for ſufficiently concluded and awarded, except it paſſe the conſent of two at the leaſt, according to the ordinance. And gaue in charge to the Court of the ſaid Iudges, that after iudgement giuen vpon the ſaid criminall enditements, they ſhould make them ſafely to be kept by ſuch Greffiers as the court ſhould appoint, to haue diligent care of the ſame, to the end they might both deliuer &amp; anſwere the ſame, whatſoeuer they ſhould be called vpon. Moreouer, he warned &amp; exhorted the Court, the Archbiſhops, and Prelates that reſorted thereunto, enioyning them to keepe and fulfill the contentes of the ſaide letters, in whatſoeuer might concerne them, the 3. of September 1551. Now let vs handle againe the imperials practiſes againſt the French: you ſhal belowe ſee in place fitter for it, the ſecond meanes which the King had to iuſtifie himſelfe for his actions in the occurrence of Parma.
            If the Emperor were angry knowing of the Kings reſolution in fauour of the Farnezes, Pope Iulye made no leſſe ſhew thereof,Pope Paul ſeeketh to retaine Octauian Farneze. and thereupon the 11. of Aprill hee bitterly accuſed Octauian by a writing publiſhed to that end. When (ſaid he) he receiued Parma at my hands, and the eſtate of Supreame Gouernour, hee promiſed me vpon his faith that he would neuer ſerue other Prince, nor put any Garriſon of Strangers into Parma without my leaue: and aſſoone as any apparance was of any change, I oftentimes very louingly admoniſhed him by men expreſſely, and by his own brother the Cardinall Alexander, that he ſhould remember his dutie. But becauſe he anſwered very ſtrangely, I threatned him by letters vnder great paines, if hee ſhould forget himſelfe: hoping in time to haue wonne him. But ſince being aduertiſed how farre he ſwarueth from the accord, I haue great cauſe to be extreamelye angrye, that one whom I had enriched and aduanced to honor, ſhould offer me ſuch an iniurye. Now then though it were lawfull for me to pronounce iudgement in ſo apparante and cleare a matter, yet to the end to make him know my curteſie, I charge him to appeare at Rome within 30. daies, to anſwere to his accuſations, and to put in good ſecurity for his comming: if hereof he make no accompt, I condemne and holde him for guilty of treaſon, diſloyaltie and other crimes, willing and meaning that all his goods ſhalbe confiſcat: for which I require aide of th'emperour; that he will holde a ſtrong hand to helpe me to puniſh the ſame, forbidding all in generall to yeelde him any releefe or ſuccour.Paul de Termes with the Pope in the French Kings behalfe.
            
            The King of Fraunce in the meane time to appeaſe the Pope and his Cardinals, declared by his Embaſſador Paul de Termes of purpoſe ſent vnto Rome, that he was no whit at all to blame for receiuing of Octauian into his protection, conſidering

it a matter proper to the office of Kings to ſuccour the afflicted. Beſides, ſayth hee, he ſought no particular profit to himſelfe, but all for the benefit of the Church of Rome, according to the example of his progenitors, which had inriched the ſame more than all other, and oftentimes defended it with the ſword: for conſidering that Parma was of the patrimonie of the Church, he would eſpecially ſeeke to preuent, that it might not fall into the handes of anie ſtranger, which was the verie reaſon that hee was at ſo great &amp; ordinarie an expence. Therfore he earneſtly beſought him to take it in good part, and not to remaine in that harde opinion hee had conceiued of him, a matter which ſhould bring great profite to the commonwealth. But if refuſing all ſatisfaction, he preferred warre before peace, he might wel perceiue the danger which would inſue to the whole Church, &amp; to Europe it ſelfe, in that it was vnpoſſible in the mean time to aſſure or eſtabliſh anie matter of religion, beſides the trouble which would fal out among Chriſtians, the Councell ſummoned coulde not aſſemble, or if it did, it muſt of neceſsitie bee diſſolued, for that as the caſe ſtoode hee ſhoulde not bee able to ſende anie of his Biſhops to the Councell of Trent. Aboue all things no fault coulde bee layde vpon him, who not onely deſired the conditions of peace, but alſo was readie to embrace them, the which hee publikely proteſted. But Iuly relying vpon the Emperours promiſes, would neuer a whit relent for this: but hauing condemned the Duke Octauian, as a rebellious vaſſall of the church, gaue leaue to the Emperour to recouer Parma in what ſort hee could. Wherefore Fernande Gonzague aſſembling with all ſpeede the garriſons of Millaine and Piemont, and beſides ioyned with the troupes which Iohn Baptiſta lead vnder the Apoſtolique title and authoritie, began to braue it in the countrie about Parma, and in the end beſieged Parma &amp; Mirandolle, which the French ſayde were adiudged by Paul the fourth, to bee helde vnder the protection of King Henrie and his ſucceſſors, who ſhortly after ſent thether Horace Farneze, brother to Octauian, with De Termes, D' Andelot, Cypierre, and ſundrie other: commanding Briſſac, his lieutenant in Piemont, to put as many as hee was able into the field, to make Fernande raiſe his ſiege, and to annoie him as much as in him laie. Which hee ſo readily performed, that hee tooke Quiers, Saint Damian, &amp; other places of the Marquiſate of Mont-ferrat, readie to haue reached further, if Gonzague had not well beſtirred himſelfe to hinder his enterie into the Dutchy of Millaine. Behold then theſe Princes which with the fire of their miſerable Countrie begin to feele, or at leaſt to foreſee the ruine of theyr poore ſubiects.
            Now as they might well thinke, that many would eaſily know and at leaſure iudge, that this fire of eternall ambition had ſoone made them forget the couenants &amp; promiſes of ſo generall a peace, of the yeere 1546. ſo did euerie of them, as well by their writings, as Embaſſadors into all partes, ſeeke to laie the fault &amp; firſt motion of breach of peace vpon his enemie. The king of France to this end, and by the ſelfe ſame hand to be meete with ſuch rumours as his enemies might cauſe to bee giuen out of him, contrarie to his owne meaning, ſent the Abbot of Bellozane to the councell of Trent, where ſundrie Princes and Prelates were aſſembled by the Emperour and Pope Iuly, as well for the matter of religion, as affaires of the Empire, and other particulars, the Cardinall Creſcence there as chiefe in the name of the Pope. The Emperour had ſent thether Frances of Toledo,The French king tearmeth the Counſell of Trent but an aſſembly. 
               Hugues Earle of Mont-fort, and Guilliaume of Poictiers: and for that the Councell daie fell on the firſt of September, the Abbot preſented him ſelfe there with his Letters addreſſed to the aſſembly. After that hee had deliuered them to the Popes Legate, and that the ſuperſcription was read, they conſulted together, why hee rather tearmed it an aſſembly than a councell: ſome being of opinion

that they ought not at all to haue beene receiued, except the Embaſſador ſhewed his warrant for the ſame. Thereupon aroſe a great tumult, with a long houting, which chiefely proceeded from the Spaniſh Biſhops. But when the Embaſſador aunſwered that his commiſſion was contained in the Letters, the Popes Legate roſe vp, and calling the fathers into the priuateſt place of the Temple, debated of the matter, where it was agreed that he ſhould bee heard, conſidering that the ſuperſcription might bee as well conſtrued in good part. After then that the Letters had beene read in priuate, by which the King declared in briefe the wrong which was done him, and the diſpleaſure which thereof hee conceiued, requiring credite to bee giuen to whatſoeuer his Embaſſadour ſhould deliuer, they fate all down againe. And after that the Letters were ther publikely rehearſed, they anſwered, that they could not take in euill part, the King tearming of the Councell an Aſſembly, not willing to miſtruſt anie euill, by ſo great a King, ſurnamed Moſt Chriſtian: that if he ſhould haue anie other intention or meaning, in that caſe they held them as not written, and ſo commanded him to deliuer what hee had in charge. Then he began his Oration, which was long,The French Embaſſadors oration in the Councell of Trent. wherein the King recited all that had paſſed betweene the Pope and the Senate of Cardinals, by his Embaſſador Paul de Termes, and that by no meanes hee could doo anie good, albeit hee had doone as much as in him laie for peace. But that Pope Iuly, who by the example of his anceſtors ought, if not cleane to appeaſe, yet at the leaſt to mittigate the debates and contentions of Princes, had contrarywiſe lighted a great fire in a moſt vnſeaſonable time: to wit, when the ſtate of Chriſtendome was maruellouſly weakned, and ſince it is ſo, that hee carrieth ſo bitter and eager a heart againſt him which is the eldeſt ſonne of the Church, hee proteſted, as before hee had done at Rome. Firſt, that for the great affayres and inconueniences whereof his hands were full, it was neither lawfull nor conuenient that anie Biſhops of his realme ſhould be ſuffered to goe to Trent. Beſides, that he doth not hold it for a publike &amp; general councel, but rather for a priuate congregation made to ſerue ſome mennes particular profite and commoditie, &amp; not for a commonwealth. And that touching anie Decree which they ſhould there make, neither hee nor anie of his realme could bee liable, or ſhoulde bee bound thereto: and farther, that if the matter ſo required, hee woulde ſerue himſelfe wyth ſuch remedies as his anceſtors were accuſtomed to doo in like caſes. True it is, that he woulde alwaies carrie a pure heart, beare a good affection to religion, and the church of Rome, and keepe himſelfe from doing ought worthie of reprehenſion. But forſomuch as he found himſelfe highly grieued at the iniuries and hatreds of ſome, which he neuer deſerued, he could doo no otherwiſe for the preſent time, &amp; that they ſhould take this his proteſtation in good part, &amp; make him an act whereby he might informe all other Princes and chriſtians of all that had beene paſſed. The Kings Letters being read, the fathers ſayde that they woulde aunſwere him in the firſt Seſſion, prouided that the King ſhould acknowledge it for a councel which was held at Trent, as touching that which then paſſed, they receiued it as farre forth as the lawe woulde permit. Wherefore they could not deliuer vnto him any act or teſtimonie whatſoeuer.
            Whereas the King ſaid, that hee woulde vſe the remedie his anceſtors were wont to practiſe, it grew thus. In France as well as other countries,The choiſe of Biſhops and Cleargie denied to the Pope. if anie Biſhoprick or Abbey became voyde, thoſe whome they tearmed Chanons or Monkes had lybertie to chooſe: the other Benefices which were not electiue, were beſtowed by the Biſhops and Patrones, and all ſuites for matter of Benefices were determined each one in his owne prouince. But the Popes by lyttle and lyttle beganne cleane to alter theſe elections, and to drawe for themſelues all the profit to Rome, by reſeruations and expectatiue

graces, and cauſed all ſuites to bee brought thether, euen at the firſt inſtance. This change began in France in the time of Lewes the ninth, who notwithſtanding ſtoutly reſiſted it, by the aduice of his Councell and Parliament, and made an ordinance in the yeer: 1267. by which hee commanded the ancient cuſtome ſhould be maintained, and for all that no man to paie ought to the Pope, which lawe ſtoode in force many yeeres after. But the authoritie of the Popes became in the end miſtreſſe, ſcattering among the Cleargie throughout Chriſtendome their graces and reſeruations, which were moſt chargeable and odious vnto euerie man, vntill the Councell of Baſle vtterly aboliſhed this manner of taking, relying vpon the ancient lawes of collations and elections, and forbidding the exaction of Auates. So as Charles the ſeuenth after that hee had ſummoned a Councel of the choiceſt men of all his realme, approued that Decree of the Councell,The enacting of La Pragmatique Sanction
                and in the yeere 1438. confirmed it by an Edict, which was commonly called La Pragmatique Sanction. Yet afterwarde Eugene the fourth pronounced this councel of no valour, ſo as the Popes which ſince ſucceeded, haue vtterly refuſed this Decree, &amp; named it Schiſmaticall. Yea Pope Pius the ſecond, ſent his Embaſſadour to Lewes the eleuenth ſonne of Charles the ſeuenth, by whom he tooth and naile inſiſted to make La Pragmatique Sanction to be aboliſhed. But the king tooke councell of the Parliment of Paris, which is the moſt renowmed of all France, compoſed of learned perſonages, and experienced in the Ciuill and Canon lawe, and in matters of eſtate, or other publike charge. Who fetching many things from the antiquitie and ordinances of the verie Popes themſelues, and Councels in time paſſed, alleadging lykewiſe what his progenitours Clodo

                  , Iohn the firſt, &amp; finally what his owne grandfather had ordained therein. And taking occaſion thereby to ſhew how exceedingly France then flouriſhed, and how in preſent ſhee was deſolate and weakned, deliuered vnto him boldly, that if the ancient lawes ſhould not remaine in force, all order of the Cleargie would come to vtter confuſion, and that France would bee in the ende left cleane vnhabited, by reaſon many retired themſelues to Rome, by little and little ſucking out the whole treaſure of the realme, whence would inſue that the Churches and ſuch like buildings would in the end be vtterly ruined throughout the whole realme. As concerning the treaſure, ſayd they, if the lawe of your Father take not place, there will yeerely bee tranſported to Rome a million of golde. For, omitting the reſt in the time of Pope Pius, at the leaſt twentie Biſhoprickes were voyde, whereof euerie one paide as wel for the Anates, as other charges, ſix thouſand crownes: about three ſcore Abbeyes, whereof euerie one payde two thouſande, and aboue two hundred other Benefices, of which euerie one paide aboue one thouſand crownes. Beſides, that there is in your realme more than an hundred thouſand pariſhes, from which a maſſe of monie is drawen by this inuention of the Popes. Followe then your Fathers traces, and ſticke faſt to the Decree of Baſle. Such was the counſell which the Parliament gaue him. But the Kinge ouercome with the authoritie or ſubtiltie of the Pope, ordayned the aboliſhing of La Pragmatique Sanction, by meanes of the Cardinall Balne, one verie familyar about the King, and deeply bound to the Pope. Notwithſtanding the Kings Proctor generall, and the Vniuerſitie of Paris, which had a greate intereſt therein, couragiouſly withſtood it, and appealed from the Pope to a Councell. Lewes the twelfth was at great oddes with Iuly the ſecond about the ſame, and it was referred to the Councell of Latran. But Frances the firſt agreed thereunto, vpon certaine conditions with Leo the tenth, in the Citie of Bologne la Graſſe, after that hee had gained all Lombardie. To wit, that a Biſhopricke or Abbey becomming voide, the Chapter

ſhould not haue power to chooſe, but that it ſhould appertaine to the King, to name ſome one within ſixe moneths to the Pope, which he thought meet for ſuch a charge. This was the matter which the King ment, when hee ſpake of a remedie by his Embaſſador: for this was the raigne wherewith the Kings euer brideled the Popes, and when they fall a quarrelling with them, they preſſe to haue La Pragmatique Sanction reuiued, cheefely in this time in which Popes commaundementes are not ſo much reuerenced as heretofore they haue beene: and in reſpect that Fraunce is large and rich, Rome cannot wel miſſe the mony without great loſſe. Now the King ſince performed in deed, what he threatned heere to Pope Iulye, as we will handle hereafter. Philip le Bel King of Fraunce, vſed the ſame remedy againſt Boniface the eight, for becauſe that he had charged him to paſſe the Seas, and to make warre againſt the Sarrazins, not taking in good parte his excuſes, hee forbad him to leuie any monye vpon the Churches, (which the King of neceſſitie was conſtrained to doe) and if he would not obey, excommunicated him. The King ſent for all his Lords and eſtates of his Realme to Paris, where after hauing diſcourſed of the outrage of Boniface, and that all the Biſhops, Princes, and Gentlemen confeſſed that they helde all their ſubſtance meerely of his grace, bounty, and liberalitie, he forbad that any mony after ſhould be tranſported to Rome, and to that end cauſed a diligent watch to be kept in all the entries and paſſages. The ſumme which was found in the account of the Parliament of Paris, of that which the Biſhoppricks and Abbies being voide did paye, muſt be vnderſtoode of the time paſſed, for at this preſent the Taxes are augmented, and paſſe the annuall reuenues, ſo as ſome of the Clergie haue beene faine to leaue their Buls in the banquers hands for the ouer-great exaction. Now there are in Fraunce twelue archbiſhoppricks, Aix, Vienne, Lyons, Narbonne, Tholouze, Bourdeaux, Aux,12. Articles in Fraunce. Bourges, Tours, Rouen, Reims, and Sens: there are about 96. Biſhoppricks, by the vacaties of which is carried to Rome a maſſe of monye, and of the Archbiſhopprickes about threeſcore thouſand, three hundred crownes, as it is apparant by an account made in the time of King Lewis the twelfth.
            Hereupon the King of Fraunce not content with the rigorous purſuites hee renewed againſt the Lutheranes,The K. letters and complaints againſt the Pope. to the end that notwithſtanding the warre hee was reſolued of againſt the Pope, he might entertaine the Catholicke Princes in good opinion of his faith and Catholicke religion, would make further ſhewe of his dutie, and iuſt occaſions of warre, by a writing ſent vnto the Pope, of whoſe deepe diſgrace hee ſtoode well aſſured: declaring therein what iniurye was doone him. The cauſe of the warre of Parma, and why receiuing of Octauian into his protection, he forbad vnder great penaltie any mony to be tranſported to Rome: for conſidering that monye was the very ſinew of warre, what follye were it ſaide hee to nouriſhe a mans enemye with his owne wealth? The propertie of Popes was to pacifie quarrelles among Kings, which Pope Paul the third did, who altogeather creeping with age, came as farre as Nice into the Country of Genes, to reconcile his late Father to th'emperour. But Iulye ranne a cleane contrary courſe, for hauing no ſooner publiſhed the counſell moſt neceſſary for the common-wealth, he preſently mooued a warre, whereby the French Church one of the moſt principall of Chriſtendome, was cleane excluded: requiring a lawfull counſel might be ſummoned, to amend as wel the faults of the Prelates and other Miniſters of the Church, as a number of other thinges being there handled, to correct the vices of euery one. This was publyſhed at Paris by ſound of Trumpet the ſeuenth of September: anon after hee had proclaimed the Edict of Chaſteau-Briant againſt the Lutheranes. Shortly after, the Imperials

cauſed the cleane contrary to be giuen out and proclaimed, in which the beginning of the warre of Parma was ſpecified, where hauing ſhewed how great reaſon the Pope had to be angry with Octauian and the Lord of Mirandolle, how contrary the King of Fraunce was bent, that ſought all occaſions and wrought all meanes to hinder the moſt honeſt enterpriſes of the Emperour, gaue notwithſtanding to wit, that Charles of Auſtria who helde his practiſes for little worth, would moſt couragiouſly and ſtoutly purſue the ende thereof. And whereas Octauian gaue out, that he was conſtrained by neceſsitie to put himſelfe vnder the ſafegarde and protection of the King of Fraunce, by reaſon of the outrages and pranckes of Ferdinand Gonzague, it was cleane refuted, for had there beene anye occaſion of feare (quoth the Emperour) he was the motyfe, who had often ſought meanes to cauſe him to be killed: it was after declared how Plaiſance was rendred vp to th'emperour, by reaſon that Pierre Louis the Popes Baſtard, enioying Parma and Plaiſance, behaued himſelfe ſo cruelly in his gouernement, that hee drewe the wrath of God vpon him, and euery mans hatred: by the example of Nero, eſpeciallye for his execrable wickednes, not onely with women, but very men: wherefore hee was moſt iuſtly murthered in his owne houſe by the Cittizens, which could not endure his cruelty any longer. This doone, the inhabitants forſeeing their apparant and imminent danger, if they ſhould fall againe into the ſubiection of the Pope and Church of Rome, could finde no other refuge or more aſſured libertie, then to render thēſelues to the Emperour: namely, hauing beene at other times vaſſailes of th'empire: they ſollicited then Gonzague and praied him to receiue thē into the Emperours protection, otherwiſe they would thinke of ſome other ſuccour and defence: it is but counterfait then in making ſemblance of feare, for the Emperour neuer gaue him occaſion, as one that had greatlye benefited the Farnezes, hauing choſen Octauian for his ſonne in law, and giuen the Citie of Nouarre for euer to his father Louis, and beſtowed on him the honor of Marqueſſe: but both of them oftentimes ſhewed themſelues maruelouſlye vngratefull, and eſpecially when they made ſhew of ayding him againſt certain rebels of Germany, for in the meane time they endeuoured to take from him both Lombardie, and Gennes it ſelfe: for proofe whereof Ioannin Dorie a vertuous man, if euer were any was moſt villanouſly murthered in the tumulte, while he faithfully employed himſelfe for the Emperour, and ſought to deliuer the Countrie from that daunger into which he ſaw it moſt ready to fall:The K. anſwere to the Emperours obiection. there was ſhortly after an anſwere put in print vnder the name of the King of Fraunce, in which was rehearſed how the Emperour deſiring to winne vnto him Paul the third, had beſtowed vpon his ſonne Pierre Louis, the tytle and dignitie of Marqueſſe, had taken Octauian ſonne to Pierre for his ſonne in law, yeelding goodly benefites to Alexander his other ſonne, beſides which he had made an alliance with the Pope, wherin was eſpecially ſet down, that the Emperour ſhould confirme the decree of the conſiſtory of Cardinals, namely, that the Emperour ſhould confirme the principallitie of Parma and Plaiſance to the familye of Farnezes. Now whereas the Emperour made warre in Germany, puniſhing ſome priuate rebellions vnder pretence of ſetting vp of religion: this ſleight meruailouſly diſpleaſed the Pope, conſidering by this meanes he ſhewed well enough that hee had no regarde but to his perticular profit, and making of himſelfe great. And in truth ſaide the King, the Pope was no whit therein miſconceiued, for as ſoone as the warre was finiſhed, and the Emperour no more in need of the Fernezes aide, he publiquely declared his euill meaning conceiued againſt the Pope: for his Liuetenants of Italie had already found meanes to compaſſe Plaiſance, and anon after murtherers

were hired to kill Pierre Louis in his chamber: and before that euer the Cittizens had notice of the murther, men of warre were ſent in to ſeaze of the Caſtle in the name of the Emperour, who if he had beene ſo ignorant of the fact, it had bene great reaſon that after the death of Pope Paul, he ſhould haue ſought the deliuery of the Cittie to the Church of Rome: but ſo farre was he from it, as he went about to take Parma out of the hands of his owne Nephewe, yea while Pope Paul liued, hee made purſuite thereof, in ſuch ſort that Paul taking a conceite thereat died for griefe. Afterwardes Ruffians were found at Parma, which of their owne accorde confeſſed that Fernande Gonzague had giuen them in charge to murther Octauian. He then perceiuing himſelfe in this diſtreſſe, that ſuch as ought to haue preſerued him, yea his own father in law, ſought to take from him not only his ſubſtance but his life, demanded ſuccour of the King, and yeelded himſelfe into his handes, which hee could not by any meanes gainſay, preſſed thereunto by ſo many teares and reaſons. The caſe ſtanding thus, and for theſe occaſions all the Princes being animated, euery one beſtirred him to doe the worſte he could againſt his enemie. Captaine Powlin hauing in readines his gallies and fleete at Marſeilles, furniſhed and victuailed for Scotland, tooke certaine Merchants Ships of Flaunders, vpon the Engliſh Sea, the which hee rifled, alleadging that vnder colour of traffique, they tranſported the victuail and munition of the Realme, to make themſelues the better able to preuaile againſt Fraunce. Elſe-where the Gouernours of the frontires prepared themſelues openly to the war: the Queene of Hungary in like ſorte being gouerneſſe for her Brother in the Lowe countrie, made ſtay of all Frenchmen and their goods, neere at the ſame time, that th'emperour diſcharging of Marillac Embaſſador for the King about his perſon, with many hard and angrye ſpeaches againſt his Maiſter, had reſolued to paſſe an armie into Fraunce, to be reuenged of the wrong which he faide he had ſuſtained. And becauſe it was doubted that hee would enter by Champagne, where Bourdillon was with certaine Troupes, the Duke of Neuers was ſent thither with 10. companies of men at armes, which hee diſtributed for the better ſtrengthening of the weaker Garriſons, prouiding as well as he could for the fortifications and munitions of thoſe places, where he beſtowed the eight olde bandes which the King had ſent vnto him: while it was thus in working, they put out into the fielde, to be the better able to put in execution ſome ſoddaine ſurpriſales, according to their olde intelligences, whereof very few tooke good effect. Then eche partie tarrying for the maine of his armye, made many little skirmiſhes, now with good, and now with bad fortune, as well on the one ſide as the other. In the meane time happened the defeat of a number of Bourgonians, which the company of Gaſper de Coligny called Chaſtillon, defeated neere vnto Montcornet in Ardennes: leauing fiue hundred dead on the place, for recompence whereof, other making a ſhew but of a ſmall company of Harquebuſiers, preſenting themſelues neere vnto Mauber-Fontaine, charged and killed in an ambuſcade, the Captaine Gourdes, accompanied with fiue and twentye olde ſouldiers, too ventrous and ill aduiſed, in not tarrying for Bourdillon and his people, who being arriued after their death, followed the Bourgonians, already retyred ſafe by the benefite of the wood, into which for want of Harquebuſiers, they could not hinder more then two partes of them that had the victorie, to retreat in ſurety: as Mazaeres ſtoode in great want of prouiſions, ioyne thereto that a Souldier loueth beſt to get from the enemy, and keep his own for his neceſſitie: Captaine Villefranche hauing in the night planted a number of matches fiered, vpon the toppe of the Caſtle Ditches at Lumes, while that the Imperials diſcharged at them both Harquebuſies,

Culuerins, and other ſhotte, tooke all the cattell and other prouiſions which the inhabitants kept by fauour of the Portes: out of which, ſome of the moſt couragious hauing ſallyed by little, ſaw thēſelues ſo bepelted with Harquebuſies, that they were conſtrained to let their prouiſions be carried to Maizieres. But the Burgonians hauing ſurpriſed the Caſtle of Aſpremont, which the yong Earle yeelded vp to the Duke of Neuers, and in a courſe killed Captaine Ligneres, and defeated the greateſt part of his company betweene Hedin and Monſtreuilſe, greatly bragged that they had beene ſo well reuenged. At the ſame time the Garriſons of Pickardie vnder the Duke of Vendoſme, and his brothers the Duke of Anguien and Prince of Conde, were no leſſe often and painefully awakened, then thoſe of Champaigne all the long winter, in which their maſters notwithſtanding were buſied about more high enterpriſes thē thoſe before mentioned, as I will make you well to perceiue.
            Beholde theſe Princes hard at it, and the originall and preparation of their quarrels: whereupon I think good before that I paſſe any further to fetch the affaires of the Chriſtians from more high, to the end I may not giue any occaſion that ſhould turne you from the knowledge of that which I will entreate of: for as I ſpeak of war, of Religion, pollicie and other humane actions, when you ſhall ſee the Counſell of Trent mentioned, and not know to what end, when, nor by whome it was helde: the Lutheranes &amp; obſtinate purſued with fire and bloud, of the time wherof you ſhould be ignorant, and of the places where they came into the worlde, by whome, and in what doctrine they ſtood inſtructed: if I ſpeake of the Proteſtantes banded, againſt ſo great Potentates, and you not know whence they deſcended, nor why their Father was ſo named, nor the variable ſucceſſe of their enterpriſes, nor how, nor why they were ſuccoured by the Kings of Fraunce, England, and other Princes, with a number of things which would remaine vnknowne vnto you, for that you could not vnderſtand their beginning and progreſſe, you would take very ſmall delight therein: at the leaſt you will take double contentment, if all the whole be made manifeſt and plaine, as you would your ſelfe deſire: ſince then that the knowledge of naturall things content not the ſpirite, if the cauſe and reaſon thereof reſt vnknowne amidſt many accidents, a ſomewhat leſſe agreeable diſcourſe, by reaſon of the ignorance of their originall, ſhall ſatisfie the more curious ſorte, if in repreſenting therein vnto you their very ſpring and true motife, I ſhall not fetch it from ouer farre.
            As the iudgements of men are diuers and oftentimes contrary, ſo is there not any thing ſo common or generall whatſoeuer, that receiueth not alteration in ſome perticular,The originall and differēce of Chriſtian religion in Fraunce. which may eaſily be ſeene in all vocations, eſpecially in the doctrine which all embrace to the conduct of their ſaluation. For to holde my peace of the diuerſitie which is amōg the Chriſtians, half Chriſtians, Mahometiſts, Iewes Paganes and other, yea of the multitude of different and contrarie opinions, which is in euery one of them, it hath bene euer ſeene, that Chriſtendome how generall ſoeuer it hath at any time beene, was alwaies ſet at controuerſie by ſome perticular iudgement: now in matter of ſubſtance, now in diſcipline, now in ceremonies and outward apparances, be it that it proceede of ignorance or of a good zeale, of malice or ſome indiſcretion of perſons, which aduaunce themſelues to ſpeake. And if wee ſhal ſeeke further examples then the memory of our fathers, it is moſt certaine that religion planted in Fraunce in the time of the Pagans, growne vnder the lyne of Clouis, was no ſooner eſtabliſhed vnder Pepin and his ſucceſſors, but the authoritie and conſequently abuſe of certaine of the Cleargie, encreaſing with the abundance of wealth, the zeale and curioſitie of ſuch as would reforme the diſcipline and life of the officers, encouraged

men by little and little to attempt to the ſubſtance, and ſome to band themſelues ſecretly and by writings, others with open mouth, againſt the Articles of doctrine, which they little iudged of, leſſe vnderſtoode, or worſe practiſed. As notwithſtanding the Paſtors confirming their generall receiued doctrine, by a better life then ours, authoriſed both by one and the other thorough a ſeuere puniſhment of iuſtice, to the example of euery one; ſo the reformation being hindered to grow by the diligence and ſtudie of the Biſhops and iuſticers, it could not ſpread ſo farre but that at this day, (when all eſtates are onely curious of their pleaſure and particuler profit) they haue themſelues giuen entrie to what they moſt complained off &amp; leaſt doubted. So many held their peace, and the hardeſt could not gaine ſo much, as to make any other opinion runne among the people then the common, vntil that the officers of the Church and iuſtice, ſurpriſed in their dutie, by ſuch as ſpied but an occaſion fit to giue entrie vnto their opinions, ſaw themſelues ſooner beaten then aſſailed, by thoſe whoſe very firſt March they alwaies before deſpiſed.How the doctrine of the Vaudois and Albigeois was diſperſed thorough Europe Then after manye and light brunts with the common faith receiued in Fraunce, (ſince the ſure and publicke eſtabliſhmentes of Chriſtian Religion) by Berenger of Tours, Abeyllard Breton, Amaury of Chartres, Arnold of Breſſe, and other, followed by a great number of Sectaries as well in this Realme as elſe where, it neuer was ſo earneſtly aſſaulted as by the Vaudoios and their ſucceſſors in Guienne and Countries about, which they named Albigeois of the towne of Alby chiefe of Albigeois, ſcituate betweene Languedos and Quercy. Who in ſpight of all the Potentates of Chriſtendome ſowed about the yeare 1100. and euen ſince their doctrine ſmally differing from the Proteſtants at this day: Not onely through Fraunce, but almoſt all the Countries of Europe. For the French, Spaniſh, Engliſh, Scots, Italians, Germaines, Bohemians, Saxons, Polonians, Lithuaniens and other people haue mightily defended it vntill this preſent. After that this doctrine had a while crept thorough Fraunce, in the end as the heate of burning coles doth exhalate and pearce thorough by little and little, the thickneſſe of the Sinders not able to quench it, it grew more commonly knowne, by Prayers, publike exhortations, adminiſtrations of Sacraments and other vſes, the courſe whereof the Clergie not being able to hinder, ſought vnder the authoritie of the Pope, aide and force at the hands of Chriſtian Princes,Opinions ſoner changed by eaſe and reſt then violence whome they ſpeedely armed againſt the Albigeois. Whom after a number of aſſaults, battels, reencounters, loſſes, ruines, victories and reciprocal aduantages, from the yeare 1200. For 50. yeares after euer maintaining by armes and force the outward ſhew of their liues, their doctrine and their Countrie together; vntil that the chiefe of them were defeated and empoueriſhed, other gained by faire proteſtations &amp; promiſes of better hap, and all in generall together wearie with the continuance of ſo long Ciuil warres: The Chriſtian Princes and Prelats of the Church left (as in contempt) a wandering people of all parts terrified with ſo cruell a warre, inſiſting in their firſt opinion, which rather the eaſe of the reſt they after felt cauſed them to chaunge, then any rigour of their enemies. So as all the French anon! after returned to the ſame doctrine, from which their fathers had ſo much ſwarued, except ſuch as retired themſelues into the mountaines, chiefely the Prouencaux, Sauoyarts, Dauphinois, and Piemontois: of whome there were many ſent into Lombardie, Calabria, Pouille, Sicille, Germaine and other places, to the end they might plant the fruite of that doctrine which they ſtoode aſſured was the moſt true &amp; auncient of Chriſtendome. Now the Engliſh was Lord of Guienne in the time of theſe Albigeois wars, by reaſon that Henrie of Aniou after the death of Stephen became king of England, Duke of Normandie, Earle of Aniou

Tourraine and Maine.The Engliſh Lords of Guienne in france Normandie, Poictou, Anioy, &amp;c. And afterwards grew to be Earle of Poictou and Duke of Aquitaine (called Guienne) by vertue of Eleonor his wife daughter to Guillame, laſt Earle of Poictou, whom king Louys le Ieune had diuourced. So as ſundry Engliſh men, which ordinarily came into thoſe countries, either by reaſons of trafique and marchandiſe, or warre againſt the French, had ſpeedely enough being imbrued with the ſame opinions, ſpread them abroad in their owne Countrie. Which hauing beene conceiued and explaned by manie, in the end fell from hand to hand into the heade of Wicklife, about 50. yeares after, a greatly renowned Diuine in the Vniuerſitie of Oxford, and Curate of Luteruorth in the Dioceſſe of Lincolne. Who in the end being a Doctor in Diuinitie thorough his eloquence and rare Doctrine, gained ſo farre the harts and vnderſtandings of the Engliſh,The Religion of the Vaudois diſperſed thorough England. and chiefely of the greateſt ſorte, as the Duke of Lancaſter vncle to king Richard, Henrie of Perſye, Lewes Clifford, the Chaunlor Kegli, the Earle of Sarisburie &amp; others, as a long time after he preached, wrought and diſperſed with all libertie what beſt ſeemed good vnto him. Moſt chiefely vnder King Edward. True it is that Pope Alexander thorough the ſollicitings of the chiefe of the Clergie,VVicklife his Doctrine. animated Richard his ſucceſſor, much againſt him in the yere 1382: Who preuailed ſo farre, that after ſundrie diſputations of the Articles of his faith, hee was baniſhed, afterwards called home, and dyed. 1387. But 40. yeares after his deceaſe, his body was puld out of the grounde by the Popes commandement, and his bones burned at Oxford 1410. before the Abbot of Shrewsberie then Chancelor. And albeit that 13. yeares after his death, 1401. his doctrine was vtterly condemned in open Parliament, with an Iniunction to all men to ſeeke out thoſe Lollards, (ſo called they ſuch as profeſſed that order of doctrine,Lollards in England, Liuonia Sermatia, &amp;c. according vnto thoſe of Pologne, and borderers vnto it) yet for all that, could it not hinder the multiplying thereof as well in that Countrie as elſe where. Chiefely in Germanie, by reaſon of the great learning which was taught by the famous Fathers of the Vniuerſitie of Oxford: Wher among other,How the doctrine of the Vaudois and Wicklife was carried into Polonia, Bohemia, and other countries of Almaine. a Scholer of Bohemia, being much delighted in a booke of Wicklifes called The Vniuerſales, caried a Coppie thereof with him into his Countrie, where the Vniuerſitie of Prague was of great commendations. In which Iohn Hus more renowned then the reſt for his quicknes of ſpirite, made himſelfe for all that much better knowne after the reading of thoſe bookes: which he explaned and ſo much thereby encreaſed the doctrine which long ſince was ſpread abroad in thoſe quarters, that many of the people, Scholers, and of the very Nobles and Clergie themſelues, followed the ſame as a matter worthy to bee receiued among men. Now among the reſt of the people which for their conſcience were perſecuted, the Bohemians had beene long before Iohn Hus,
               The Bohemians and Almaines perſecuted by the Popes inquiſitors before Iohn Hus. by Venceſlaus King of Bohemia, who made great ſearch after them &amp; roundly puniſhed them. And by the Pope, who long before that, had ſent thither an inquiſitor of the ill affected of the faith, who (Iohn Hus liuing) was named Biſhop of Nazaret. Be it then that the perſecutions either coolled this kinde of people thorough out Chriſtendome, or that the Princes and Cleargie made no accounte of thoſe, who ſtanding fauoured by no great perſonages became all ſimple people and inhabitants of the Montaignes, as thoſe of Piemont, Sauoye, Calabria, and other, the Bohemians ſtoode at that inſtant moſt renowned and worſt ment to. Eſpecially after that Hus had reformed his preaching, leaſſons and writings by the tradition of Wicklife. So as in the yeare, 1414. the Counſell being ſummoned at Conſtance, for the controuerſie of the Popes, and reformation of the Cleargie, Iohn Hus a Batchelor in Diuinitie, to the end to purge himſelfe of the hereſie which was laide to his charge, was cited thither by the Pope, and after hauing refuſed to come, accounting it no ſafe or ſure place, hee

was perſwaded by Sigiſmond the Emperour that they might ſafely goe thether and returne againe, at the requeſt of his brother Venceſlaus King of the Countrie: and beſides that Venceſlaus of Dube, and Iohn De Chlum Gentlemen of Pologne, ſhould accompanie him. But ſo farre was hee from being ſuffered to preſent himſelfe to the aſſembly of the Councell, to render accounte of his faith as the Emperour and his brother would haue had it, that the Cardinals clapt him vp cloſe priſoner:Councell of Conſtance ſummoned for the refomation of the Church. &amp; cleane contrarie to the earneſt requeſts, which not onely many Gentlemen of Bohemia, but the very Vniuerſitie of Prague made, that he might not bee condemned before hee were publikely hard. But in the end the Emperour being perſwaded, that there could bee no defence, ſafe conduct or other meanes yeelded to him, which had beene alreadie condemned as an heretique, and eſpecially a Proteſtant, publike profeſt, and that he ought rather to prepare woode and fire to conſume him into aſhes,Iohn Hus, cō
                  demned, and burnt as an heretique at Conſtance, notwithſtanding the Emperours ſafe conduct. if he would not decline from his obſtinacie, the ſeuenth of Iuly preſiding amidſt al the Princes &amp; Prelates with his imperiall robes in the great temple of Conſtance, after certaine Articles there drawne out of his writings as hereticall, one of the deputies which examined him, pronounced that the Councell declared him for an heretique, a Diſciple and fauourer of Wicklife, whoſe books had beene already burnt by a Councel at Rome, that he was wilfull in his hereſies, for the appeale which he had caſt in from the Councell to Ieſus, reprouing his appellation as ſcandalous and iniurious to the Popes authoritie and Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction: and therefore hee was to bee diſgraded of his Prieſtly order, with all infamie and reproch, afterwardes the Biſhops attired him in a profane garment and eſtate, and gaue him a crowne of Paper one cubite high, painted with three blacke and ougly Deuils, hauing for deuiſe Hereſiarcha as one ſhoulde ſaye the chiefe and Prince of heretiques. This doone the Emperour into whoſe handes the Cleargie had put him, as the ſecular arme, commanded D. Louis of Bauiere, kneeling before him with his ornament in his hand an Apple of Golde and the figure of the Croſſe) to deliuer him to the hangman, who hauing burned his bookes, and tyed him faſt with an yron cheane to a ſtake, piled vp with woode and ſtrawe to his chinne, ſoone conſumed him to aſhes, which they flong into the Rhine, to the end no more memorie ſhould remaine of him. Hereupon the Princes for to remedie all abuſes, and replante the Church in her firſt glorie, depoſed Pope Iohn 24. of that name, as a Simonous heretique, and man-ſlaier, who fled diſguiſed to Scafuſen, and from thence to Fribourg in Briſgoe: But being taken in the fift yeare of his Pontificate, was three yeares kept priſoner. Gregorie who likewiſe had held him ſelfe for Pope,Popes depoſed. diſmiſſed himſelfe of the popedome. And Pierre de la Lune named Pope Benoiſt, was condemned for ſundrie offences. Iohn Gerſon Chauncelor of the Vniuerſitie of Paris (which had ſent him with others to Conſtance) ſayde that neuer there woulde bee any Peace in the Church vntill the Moone were taken awaie. Martin the fift of that name before called Ame de Sauoie, was choſen and approued of all.
            
               Hieroſme of Prague companion to Iohn Hus, vnderſtanding of his entertainement, departed out of Bohemia, and the 4. of April 1415. arriued neere Conſtance to comfort him, and offered to anſwere all ſuch iniuries in open councell as were giuen out of them of Bohemia, if they would giue him any ſafe-conduct:Ierome of Prag condemned and burned at Conſtance as Iohn Hus. which being refuſed by the Emperour, he contented himſelfe in obtaining of the Lords and Protector of Bohemia, their letters ſealed with their ſeales, witneſſing his innocencie, and that he was come to anſwere ſuch reproches as his aduerſaries had giuen out: but as hee thought to haue returned, hee was taken and carried to Conſtance, where he was ſo ſtraightly vſed and examined, that in the end he publiquely rehearſed a forme of abiuration,

which they deliuered vnto him, confeſſing further that Iohn Hus was lawfully puniſhed. But as they let him goe neuer a whit the ſooner for that, and thereuppon certaine Carmos of Bohemia being come with new accuſations, he recanted and ſtucke ſo faſt to his firſt opinion, that the councell condemned him as before they did Iohn Hus, whence he appealed vnto Ieſus Chriſt: ſo that (ſaid hee) after one hundred yeares you ſhall make account for me: but the hangmen did as much for him as the other. Poge Florentin being preſent at all, greatly commended in a wrighting which he ſent vnto Leonard Aretin, the eloquence, grace, knowledge, and maruellous conſtancie of Hieroſme: thinking nothing wanting in him but a conformitie of the common faith. Now when theſe newes were carried into Bohemia, ſuch Gentlemen and other as had beene inſtructed in this doctrine, growing maruellous angrye, ſent their letters to the Princes and Prelates of Conſtance,
               The Bohemians angrye, growe more reſolute by the death of Hus and Hierom. to teſtifie their conceiued diſpleaſure, and their reſolution to perſiſt in the ſame opinion euen to the death and coſt of the moſt miſchieuous, foure and fiftie of the beſt calling ſigned and ſealed it with their ſeales. And indeed as rigours onely doe not cauſe men to change opinion, but oftentimes make them more wilfully to perſiſt therein: the Huſsite Bohemians multiplying more and more, beſought of their King Venceſlaus many Temples, in which they might exerciſe and aduaunce their doctrine, being ſuch a number of people as hourely were gained,Captain Ziſcha leuieth men againſt the Prieſts &amp; Monkes of Bohemia. among the reſt Iohn Ziſcha of Troſnouie, one of the moſt renowned warriers that followed the King, and which had loſt one of his eyes in the former factions, leuied a number of men to the ruine of as many Prieſts and Monkes as they found to haue beene authors of the matter of Conſtance: and ſo began to pul downe Temples, bruſe the Images, throwe downe the Monaſteries, and pull out the Monkes, whome they named Swine fatted in their Cloiſter: finally in ſmal time were aſſembled more then fortie thouſand men, maintaining the doctrine of Iohn Hus. In the mean while Sigiſmond the Emperour, &amp; true heire to the kingdom of Bohemia by the deceaſe of his Brother, going thither to take poſſeſsion, found all paſſages ſhut by the people, who extreamly hated him for breach of his faith: ſo as after many a good and badde reencounter on the one ſide and the other, he loſt his other eye likewiſe at the ſiege of Rabi, and yet ceaſſed not for all that to conducte and gouerne his army, yea oftentimes breaking the troupes of Sigiſmonde, compoſed of Hungarians, Bohemians, Moraues, Almanes and Danes: for Eric King of Denmarke was come thither to ſuccour him, with Pierre Infant of Portugall; in ſorte that the Emperour perceiuing that hee could not otherwiſe remedye it, gained him by faire promiſes of graunting vnto him what charge ſoeuer he would require. But Ziſcha as hee was going to the Emperour dyed of the Plague, and being asked in his ſickneſſe where hee would be buried, anſwered that he would haue them flea his body after his death, and with his skinne head a Drumme, at the ſounde whereof hee doubted not but all his enemies would ſoone betake them to their heeles.
            From this time forwards the perſecutions cōtinued in the church, almoſt throughout all Chriſtendome,Luther &amp; his beginning 1518. at the purſute of the Inquiſitors who were annimated enough againſt the ill affected in the faith, but more againe ſome perticular and ſimple people then perſons of marke, vntill the comming of Luther, which then they the more augmented as they ſaw mens faith, beleefe and charitie, to diminiſh towards men of the Church: ſo as the Chriſtian faith being receiued and oppugned almoſte in euerlye countrie, though in ſome one leſſe ſharpely then other (where great ones countenanced them out, by credit, force of arms, and other means) you may not finde it ſtrange if the religion leſſe common and more ſecret, ſeeking in all times and places but occaſion

and meanes fit to lifte vp and ſpread it ſelfe abroade, knew well how to take her time in the end 1518. to make her ſelfe knowne by the negligence of the Germaine Prelates, and the diligence and hardines of Luther, who reuiuing of theſe olde opinions, and adding thereunto what before but by the ignorance of the ſimple people he thought omitted, afterwards explaining the ſame by a well ordered deliuery, and expreſsing it in his Sermons and wrightings, through his eloquence and doctrine, diſcouered vnto vs ſuch a kinde of reformation, as hath engendered more ſtrange effectes then euer any man could ſee, read, or vnderſtand to haue bene practiſed in any other place. Now for that the particulars are very memorable and worthy to be left to the poſteritie, I am contented to fetch the narration therof, from the firſt originall, to the ende I would not leaue any thing vnto you, which might ſtaye you from the entire knowledge of ſo notable accidents, as vpon this occaſion made all chriſtendome both admire and ſtand wonderfully aſtonied.
            The pardons which Pope Leo publiſhed throughout the world, 1517. to get mony, and prouide for a warre pretended againſt the Turke,Generall pardons publiſhed through Chriſtendom 1517. were an occaſion together with the abuſes his Treaſorers offred in the leuying thereof, (as the moſt learned and notable writers as well of Germany as Italy hath left) that Luther firſt declared himſelfe an enemy to the ouercharging of conſciences, then a Cenſor of Popes and eccleſiaſticall abuſes, to reforme in the ende the more receaued doctrine in the Chriſtian Church, for firſt he found himſelfe agreeued at the pardons, next banded himſelfe againſt the inſolencies of Receiuers, and hauing put in queſtion the autoritye of the Pope, which defended them, he came by little and little cleane to contemne the doctrine of the Church of Rome: next to reforme it, and in the end vtterly to reiecte it. Now as Leo (ſay they) vſed too licentiouſly the authoritie of the Romiſh Sea, chiefly in ſuch graces as the Court gaue of ſpirituall and beneficiall matters, by the councell of Laurens Puccy Cardinall of the title of 4. Sains, ſo hee ſcattered throughout, without diſtinction of time or place, his generall pardons of pleanary remiſsion, aſwell for the quicke as the dead: and deliuered ſoules out of the paines of Purgatory. And becauſe ſuch fauours were deliuered ſo there were mony, and that the Treaſurers bought their offices at the Popes handes, and that little which did come vnto his hands was ſpent badly enough in other affaires, that hee ſawe many of his Miniſters ſell for ſmall price, yea play away at Tauernes, power to deliuer ſoules out of Purgatorye, and that the Pope (who by the meekenes of his owne nature, exerciſed in many things his pontificall office with little enough Maieſtie) had at one blowe giuen vnto his ſiſter Magdelaine the profit of ſuch Indulgences as might be reaped in ſundry Countries of Germany, who deputed for her the Biſhop Arebaut, that executed his charge but with too much couetouſnes and extortion: and that Leo had permitted the King of Fraunce, to vſe the laſt payments of his own Realme as ſhould pleaſe him vntill the warre againſt the Turke; all ſauing 50. thouſand crowns which he gaue to Laurence de Medicis his Nephew. Luther a Regent Doctor in diuinitie, thought thē he had read, ſeene, and heard enough to deſpiſe ſuch Indulgences, and to be able to taxe therein the authoritie of the Pope: but afterwards a great number of Auditors running thither, to the end they might heare ſome noueltye to delight them, the popular winde, no leſſe then the fauour of the Duke of Saxe, one of the electors of the Empire, and the greateſt landed of all Germany, ſo egged him forward that hee did not only band himſelf againſt the power of the Popes, and authoritie of the Church of Rome, but yeelding himſelfe to the anger conceiued, for the iniuries and ſharpe purſuites of the Receiuers, and ſuch as ſpurned againſt him, hee grew in the ende to

make open warre againſt the doctrine of the Church. The Pope as they ſay beſtirred himſelfe well in the beginning for to quench this fire, but not vſing the proper remedies &amp; medicines,Luther cited to Rome. he did but impaire ſo great a maladie, for he cited Luther to Rome, he forbad him to preach, and after ſeeing of his diſobedience, he gaue him ouer to the cenſure of the Church, neuer himſelfe in all this time abſtaining from many things of euill example: which hauing bene with reaſon blamed by Luther, were by his Sermons, leſſons, and writings, rendred a great deale more odious to euery man: ſo as proceeding againſt him with Eccleſiaſticall weapons, without amending matters of euil example in his own Court at Rome, (and which ſince they were made and conſtrained to reforme) ſo much the more grew the reputation of Luther among the people, as they ſawe him more perſecuted for the innocencie of his life, and pure doctrine which he preached then any thing elſe. And albeit that many were of opinion both at Rome and elſewhere, that it were leſſe inconuenience to diſſemble the fire of ſuch follie, which peraduenture would growe of it ſelfe into ſmoake, then in kindling and blowing it through the ſharpenes of ſuch purſuites, to make it encreaſe and growe in greater blaze then before: and chiefely for that a little wealth and honor had in the beginning, made him to eate his worde, namely, at ſuch time as hee was baniſhed by the Emperour at the Diet of Wormes, aſſuring themſelues to haue ſeene him in ſuch a fright, as if the iniurious and threatning wordes of the Cardinall S. Xixte, Legat had not led him to a laſt diſpaire, hee would gladly enough haue beene reconciled to the Church, and beene made to leaue his opinions. So it came to paſſe (as men are rather enclined to remedie inconueniences by vehemency and rigour, then fair means and curteſie) that not onely the perſecutions which augmented daylye againſt him and his Lutheranes, but alſo a terrible excommunication being reſolued againſt the Duke of Saxe, rendred this Prince more feruent thē euer, to the defence of the cauſe. True it is that the opinion which was helde among many Princes, that the followers of this doctrine were no leſſe enemies to the temporall Lordes, then to the authoritie of the Churchmen, was an occaſion that many ſoueraign and other Magiſtrates,What cauſed a ſtay of Luthers reformation. diligently hindred, and with great ſeueritie, the publication therof in their countries. Beſides that the multitude and contrariety of moſt abſurde hereſies, which crept in at that very time, did maruelouſly retarde the beginning, yea and bring a maruellous abatement to the doctrine it ſelfe: but the liberty which the people in the end reſumed in their manner of life, (I will holde my peace as concerning the merite of the doctrine) and the couetous obſtinacy of great ones, who could neuer be broght to leaue any more their ancient manners, then the goods which they vſurped of the Church, did adde vnto him ſo ſtrong winges, that many preſaged his more high and loftye flight, then hath as yet beene ſeene, howſoeuer in a worde to teach perticularlye the beginning of his reformation.
            
               Martin Luthers beginning, profeſsion, and carriadge of life.
               Martin Luther borne the 10. of Nouember 1483. at Iſlebe in the Countye of Mansfelde, ſent to Magdeburg and Iſcena to plye his ſtudye, and then being giuen altogither to Logique and Philoſophie at Erforde, ſhortlye after rendred himſelfe Munke in the Conuent of Auguſtines, againſt the will of his parentes and friendes, giuing himſelfe to the ſtudie of Diuinitie,Luther himſelfe confeſſeth it in his anſwer to the book which H. D. of Brunwick wrote againſt him 1541. as Sleyden reporteth in the 14. of his hiſtory, repeating Luthers words, who diſcouered the occaſions which moued him to preach and write againſt pardons. My name, ſaith he, began to grow famous becauſe no man was found elſe that durſt oppoſe himſelfe. This little glory was pleaſing as then vnto me, &amp;c. in liew of the Ciuill and Cannon law, to the expectation whereof as well his firſt bringing vp, as the deſire of his parents would haue deſtined him. So as Stupice Vicar of the order of the Auguſtines, who had the charge of the Vniuerſitie lately erected at Witemburge in Saxe vpon the Riuer of Albye, made Luther goe thither to reade Diuinitie Lecture: ſince being returned from Rome, whether in the yeare 1510. his brethren had ſent him to ſollicite and

followe a ſute which they had there, hee paſſed himſelfe Doctor at the expences of Duke Frederic of Saxe, elector of th'empire, vnder whome as he ſeldome employed himſelfe but in his ſtudie, and that more then 2. thirds of Chriſtians, with one conſent approued the faith and catholique Romane religion, the ſuddaine and vnlooked for accident of generall pardons, occaſioned him though vnskilfully, to debate in the beginning, by way of Colledge diſputations, ſome pointes different in Religion. Afterwards the fire of an ambitious anger, inflamed by the vndiſcreet couetouſnes of certaine Queſtors, encreaſed by the iniurious gain-ſayinges of ſuch and other his aduerſaries, ioyned thereto the zeale which he had to guide the more ſimple ſort, in a way which ſeemed better vnto him, encouraged him to reforme and in the ende to reiect almoſt all the doctrine which had beene generally receiued of our fathers, as ſoone as he ſaw himſelfe excommunicated by the Pope, and baniſhed by the Emperour Charles the fifth, 1519. See heere the beginning of pardons, and true motife of the Croizade, the fruites whereof at firſte being ordained for the defence of the Chriſtian faith and nation, were imployed notwithſtanding as you ſhall perceiue.
            
               Selim King of Turkes, a naturall and ancient enemie to the Chriſtians, had made himſelfe in that time ſo much more dreadfull to them all, as beſides the conſideration of his new conqueſts, whereby he had increaſed the Ottoman empire, he dreamed of nothing more puffed vp by reading of the happy carriages of Alexander the great, then to make the conqueſt of the worlde more eaſie to himſelfe then the other: for hauing cauſed Baiazet his Father (who had thought to haue made Acomat his eldeſt brother King) with Acomat, Corcu his brethren, and all their race to be murthered,Selim King of Turkes dreadfull to his enemies. was halfe perſwaded to haue done as much to his owne onely ſonne Solyman: he tamed the Aduliens, defeated the Zophy in battaile, took Tauris chiefe Cittie of Perſia, and parte of the Realme, which being forced to leaue for want of victuall,Selims crueltie towards his father, bretheren and race. and turning toward Syria, ouerthrew two Souldanes of Egipt, and after hauing made a cleane end of Mamelus race, principall of the Souldanes, he inueſted himſelfe in their kingdomes, for gouernement whereof hauing left a Lord in Caire, chiefe Cittie of the Countrie, almoſt doubled his reuennues, and entertaining armes both by Sea and land, for th'execution of higher intents, made himſelfe ſo horriblye feared of his neighbours, as the leſſe aſſured tooke all paines to animate the reſt of the Potentates to oppoſe themſelues againſt his enterpriſes: who fearing leaſt the good hap of his ſo great victories atchieued, would make his hart ſwell to the aſpiring of their ruine, chiefely conſidering that he ſo proſperouſly accompanied his power &amp; valour with a burning deſire of making himſelfe a Monarque, and by his famous enterpriſes, his name appeered moſt glorious to poſteritie: determined at the earneſt ſolliciting of the Emperour Maximilian, and Pope Leo, to make the greateſt maſſe of men, armour, and monie, that they were able, to the end they might at leaſt exclude his entrie into Chriſtendome, if they found not themſelues able to perfourm any way his ruyne: imagining that he would attempt Rhodes or Hungarie, if hee ment not to diſcende into Italye, by the example of Mahomet his Grandfather,Pope Leo endeuoureth the Chriſtian Princes to enter league againſt the Turkes. who ſurprized Otrante with a very ſmal power which hee ſent thither. The Pope then &amp; the whole Court of Rome after certain ſolemne Proceſſions, in which they went bare-footed, ſent briefes to all Princes, to giue them warning of the imminent danger, and to pray them that all their quarrels ſet aſide, they would readily aduiſe for the defence of Religion and common health, growing ſo vncertaine, if by a generall force and agreement they would not make warre in Turkie, to aſſaile the enemy in his owne home: whereupon hauing well conſidered of the eſtate between the Turks and Chriſtians,

it was reſolued that the Emperour accompanied with Hungarians, Polonians, and Germanes, ſhuld ſet forward through Danube in Boſsine, (anciently Miſia) to the end to paſſe into Thracia, and ſo approch Cōſtantinople, the cheefe ſeate of Ottomans: that the King of Fraunce with the Italians and Zuiſsers, ſhould paſſe from the Port of Brundieſe into Albanie,How the Chriſtians armie ſhould be beſtowed to annoy the Turke. (a very eaſie and ſhorte paſſage) to conquere Greece, which being peopled with Chriſtans, &amp; in generall too rigorouſly handled by the Turkes, was in a māner readie to reuolte, that the King of Spaines, Portugal &amp; Englands forces, ioyned by Sea at Carthage, and hauens thereabouts, ſhould prepare for the ſtraight of Gallipoly to aſſault Conſtantinople, after hauing taken the Dardanes, otherwiſe the Caſtles ſeated at the mouth of the ſtraight, that the Pope ſhould followe from Ancone with one hundred Gallies, and that for the maintenance therof ſhould be made the greateſt prouiſion of monye that was poſſible, by a voluntary contribution among the Princes, and a forme of Impoſt free in generall to be gathered thoroughout Chriſtendome. This act proclaimed vniuerſall Truce for fiue yeares thoroughout Chriſtendome, vnder paines of great cenſures to the breakers thereof: and to the end that all particulars of greater importance which ſprung from ſo high an affaire, might be the better reſolued of the one ſide and the other, by the aduiſe of the Princes Embaſſadors which were reſident about his perſon, hee ſent out men of worth and reputation, (all Cardinals) for his Legates to all Princes. Now albeit this beginning had bred in the hart of euery one, a great hope of a laudable conduct and mo
                  ••
                happy end to enſue the whole plat, yea after the Truce was accepted of among them, which ſhewed themſelues with great vaunts and mighty words, ready for the execution of ſuch an enterpriſe, yet each one finding very vneaſie the conduct of a matter ſo greatly important, the euent vncertaine, farre diſtance, and more appertayning to the eſtates of the one then the other, and which asked a farre longer time to compaſſe among themſelues ſo vniuerſall an vnion and affection, as was requiſite to this action,Chriſtian Princes rather reſpected their perticular, then the common cauſe. the priuate intereſts and commodities cleane carried away the conſideration of the publique. In ſuch ſorte that theſe practiſes were not onely not brought to any aſſured hope of to come, but were handled lightly, and almoſt in a kinde of ceremonie, each one to acquite himſelfe ſo of his duetie: according to the nature of men to whom things in the beginning ſeeming moſt terrible, doe ſo diminiſh day by day, and vaniſh by little and little in ſuch ſorte, that without a chaunce of new accidents which may renew their feare, they yeelde themſelues but too ſoone aſſured of what may afterwards betide them: ſo as this negligence of the publique cauſe, &amp; immoderate affection of ſome particular, was the more confirmed by the death of Selim,
               Selim dieth, Soliman ſucceedeth. (whoſe long ſicknes had delaied, and his death after cleane broken the preparations of the warre) who left ſo great an Empire to his ſonne Soliman, yong of age, but accounted of a milde ſpirite and little courage, (though his effectes after ſhewed the contrary) that the Chriſtians not eſteeming him borne for armes, ſoone enough freed themſelues of the feare which they had had of the actions paſſed. Notwithſtanding before the death of Selim, and during the occaſions as yet they had to feare the Turke, the Emperour aſſigned a day at Ausbourge, whether all the Princes chriſtned were ſummoned to anſwere. And to that end Pope Leo ſent his Bulls of great pardons throughout all Chriſtendome, with promiſe of remiſſion of ſinnes, and kingdom of heauen, to all ſuch as would help the Church with a certain ſumme of monie: and as well to aduance forward his Indulgences, as to animate the Chriſtians to this warre, he diſpatched Thomas Caietan his Legate into Germanie. Heereupon the quicke and prompt ſpirite of Luther, who as the moſt renowmed of his owne profeſſion

had already read many ſortes of Bookes, in the moſt famous Vniuerſitie of Germanye, found the preachinges and cariadges of theſe Queſtors very ſtrange. Afterwards comming to doubt of the vertue of pardons, becauſe hee ſaide that hee neuer remembred he found in his bookes that one ought to make traffique of the ſinnes of men; and leaſt that they could be redeemed with any monie, but the bloud of Chriſt, ſince that the Cannon did teach ſinnes could not be remitted by pardons, no more then that the Preachers ought to ſell licenſe, to eate Egges, Milke, Fleſh, and Cheeſe, vpon daies forbidden, promiſing beſides to forgiue all ſinnes,The palorepiſcopal mantle, how made and giuen by Popes. how great ſoeuer, yea and to come, ſent out his letters in October 1517. to certaine Prelates of Germany, praying them to take order therein, to refourme the preachinges and imprinted bookes of thoſe Queſtors: and ſince ſent ninety fiue propoſitions (a little before publiſhed at Witemburge in manner of a ſcholaſticall deſputation) of Purgatory, Penance, duetie of Charitie, Indulgences and pardons, to ſearch out, ſaide hee, the truth, and not to reſolue: proteſting that he would affirme nothing therein, but ſubmit all to the iudgement of the holy Church. Now he firſt addreſſed himſelfe to the Archbiſhop of Mayence for the reaſons which enſue. Albert of Brandebourge hauing bene lately by Pope Leo created Archbiſhop of Mayence, ſeeing that the Chaptre and Cannons excuſed themſelues by reaſon of their former charges, not to bee able to furniſh him with monye to buye his Made of the wool of two white Mattons, ſet vpon the Aulter in S. Agnes Church, while Agnus Dei is ſung vpon that holy day, and afterwards giuē to the Subdeacons of S. Peters, who ſhere them at ſhering time, and of the yarne which cōmeth from them among other, maketh a mantle three fingers broad, &amp; reaching from the ſhoulders to the calfe of the leg with little knobs of lead at the skirts, from thence laide vpon the corps of S. Peter &amp; S Paul, with certaine praiers, and kept there one night, with great ceremony, after deliuered to him that muſt haue it, and is only for Archbiſhops. Epiſcopall mantle, which will coſt aboue thirtye thouſand Crownes, before it bee brought home, found meanes by accorde with the Pope, to ſende Iohn Tekel a Iacobin, to preach pardons (alreadye publiſhed elſe where) throughout all his Dioceſſe, and to ſet forth their vertue to all ſuch as would disburſe monye, with charge that halfe the gaine ſhould returne to Rome, for the building vp of the Church of S. Peter, for in as much as the Foucres of Germanie had impreſt their monie, there could not be a better meanes then this found to repaire them. Such was the firſt, howſoeuer the moſt apparant beginning of our euils, drawne from a thrid of wooll, which ſince hath been by ſo many people, in ſo many places, and ſo ſtrongly winded and writhed, as many millions of men haue bene thereby hanged and ſtrangled. Now beit for feare of cenſures, or thunder of excommunication, which theſe Queſtors caried about with them, no man durſt lifte vp his head to bande againſt them but Luther: many Diuines and Lawyers, to apeaſe the murmures &amp; ſhut his mouth, began to inueigh againſt him by a form of anſwer to his ſolate and hardye propoſitions: among the reſt Iohn Tekel publiſhed certaine theames cleane contrary, at Frankfort on the Viadre, in the ſeignorie of Brandebourghe, praiſing therein aboue all, the authoritie of the Pope, the profit of pardons, and the woodden Croſſe, which the Pope had cauſed to be ſet vp in all Temples, comparing it to Ieſus Chriſt, as Leo to S. Peter: whereupon Luther taking occaſion to manifeſt himſelfe, ſent the explication of his owne to ſundry, and euen to Leo himſelfe, in Iune 1518. declaring vnto him what follies his Queſtors had taught, and their pickerie of the ſimplier people, truſting vpon or abuſing his authoritie, and for that hee doubted he might be accuſed towards him, he beſought him to giue no credit to their calumnies, conſidering that Frederick the Elector, the vniuerſitie of Wittenberge, nor ſo many other would haue approued his actions if there had bene any impiety in them: In ſumme, hee ſubmitted his writinges, his life, and his health to his good pleaſure, accounting whatſoeuer ſhould proceede from him as from Chriſt, not refuſing to haue his head ſtrooke of if he would ſo ordaine it. Hereupon Iohn Eccius a Diuine, publiſhed to the contrary a Booke, entituled Les Effaceurs, to cote the faultes of Luthers writings. But he that moſt of all animated him, was Silueſtre Prieras, Iacobin maſter

of S. Pallaies, by a booke, where hauing ſet downe the Pope aboue the Councell, yea and the ſcripture it ſelfe, which ſaid he had no vertue and authoritie but from the Church and Pope of Rome, hee ſeemed to take occaſion to digreſſe vpon the great vertue of Indulgences, for Luther ſetting himſelfe to anſwere it, ſaid that it was a booke ſo full of horrible lyes and blaſphemies againſt the diuine name, that there is great apparence that Sathan was the very author: that if the Pope (ſaith he) and his Cardinals be of the ſame opinion, and if the like be helde and taught at Rome, there is no doubt but that it is the true ſeate of Antechriſt: wherefore Greece and Bohemia were moſt happie that were ſeperated from it, and thoſe contrariwiſe miſerable that helde neuer ſo little thereof: if then the Pope would not repreſſe this Prieras, if he made him not vnſay it, he proteſted that hee would be at diſcorde with him, and that he would be ſo far from acknowledging the Church of Rome for a true church, that he would contrariwiſe holde her for a taſte of all villanie, and for a place vowed to all impiety: vpon this difference heated by Silueſtre, he made him be cited to Rome, to come and defend his propoſitions: Leo commaunded Caietan rather by force of th'emperour to bring him to Ausbourghe, and from thence to Rome, commaunding all men to obey this commaundement, on paine of infamie and loſſe of goods: yea giuing entire abſolution of all ſinnes, to ſuch as would imploy themſelues to the execution thereof as aboueſaide: and praying Frederic not to fauour him, but to ſend him away with ſpeede, promiſing to ſend him back againe, if hee were not found culpable: he warned alſo that Gabriel a Venetian, great Vicar of the Iacobins, that hee ſhould not ſuffer him to teach, and earneſtly ſollicited him by letters and meſſages, for by extreame diligence (ſaid he) the fire alreadye kindled muſt bee quenched. As things newly ſprung vp cannot cary any great force, but if by delay a miſchiefe be ſuffered to grow ſtronger, it is to be feared, that afterwards it may grow vncurable, conſidering that day by day the euill encreaſed, in which nothing is more to be ſhunned then delay: Luther would not goe thither, ſaying that the place ſtood very ſuſpitious and dangerous for him, but ſollicited to haue the cauſe debated in ſome free place of Germany. The vniuerſitie of Witemberg wrote in his fauour to Pope Leo, to whom hauing proteſted that he would neither think nor ſpeake againſt the faith receaued in the holy Sea,Luther appereth before Caietan the Popes Legat. gaue notwithſtanding atteſtation of his good life and better doctrine, and beſought him to ordaine indifferent Iudges in Germanie: Frederic in the end dealt ſo farre with Caietan, that by the ſafe conduct of the Emperour, hee ſhould be admitted to defende his cauſe at Ausbourghe before him, without going at all to Rome: who ſet before him that hee ſhould repent himſelfe by acknowledging of his errour, and that hee ſhould no more wright ought which might trouble the peace of the Church: for the firſt, he ſaid he could not acknowledge that he had failed, but for the ſecond he would obey it. But Caietan telling him that he did not eſteem ſo highly of the Popes authoritie as he ought, &amp; that in his propoſitions he ſhould ſay the merites of Chriſt were not the treaſure of Indulgences, (contrarye to the decree of Clement the ſixth) and that faith is neceſſary to ſuch as would receiue the holy Sacramēt, in ſorte that they aſſured themſelues their ſinnes wer pardoned; It is falſe (ſaid he) before diuers witneſſes, one Notaire, and foure Councellers of the Emperours: &amp; proteſted that he had euer honoured &amp; reuerenced the Church of Rome, and that if he had ſaid ought repugnant thereunto, he would not abide by it: but in that hee was vrged to renounce his errour, hee ſaid hee did not think that euer hee ſpake any thing contrary to the ſcripture, opinion of ancient fathers, decree of Popes, or the right reaſon it ſelfe. Notwithſtanding for that he confeſſed he might faile, a matter naturall to

man, hee ſubmitted himſelf to the knowledge of the holy church, &amp; refuſed not that the vniuerſities of Germany and Paris ſhould yeeld their opinion, requiring then that the knowledge of the fact might bee ſent to the Pope, nothing being able to come more pleaſing vnto him, then to haue the voice of the Church vpon the ſame: he acknowledged how he had bene too bitter and leſſe reuerent towards his dignitie, but the faulte was to be laide vpon th'importunitye of the Queſtors, and praied that hee might be pardoned, promiſing euer after greater modeſty, and that euen in his preachings he would content the Pope, and would ſpeake no more of pardons, if they would likewiſe ſhut vp the mouthes of his aduerſaries:Luther apealeth from Caietan. wherupon ſeeing that Caietan preſſed him ſo ſore to recant, otherwiſe threatned him with paines ordained by the Pope, and excōmunication if he repented not, he was coūcelled to appeal from him to the Pope. The appeale contained that the queſtion of Pardons had bene diſputed by many, and yet neuer certainly determined; &amp; that in ſuch queſtions it was lawful eſpecially for Diuines to diſpute, the which he the rather did, by reaſon of ſo ſottiſh Queſtors, as exacted the people in ſo many kinde of ſorts, and yet not to affirme any thing therin, but the better to know the truth, leauing the whole to the iudgment of the moſt learned &amp; Leo himſelf. Notwithſtanding by the aduiſe of the B. of Scoli and Prieras his Iudges eſtabliſhed by the Pope, he had bene cited to Rome, &amp; from thēce the cauſe ſent back to Caietan, whom as ſuſpected he might well haue refuſed, yet for all that he rendred all obedience, but ſeeing himſelfe ſtill preſſed to recant, threatned with great paines, yea and ready to haue had worſe, greeued with ſuch preiudicies,The foundation of pardons and Indulgences. hee appealed from an ill informed Pope to a Pope better councelled. The decree of Clement which hee ſo vrged, is in the extrauagants of the Cannon, where ſpeaking of the benefite of Chriſt, he ſaith that one droppe of his bloud was ſufficient to haue redeemed mankinde, but ſo much being ſhedde as nothing whole and entyre reſted behinde, it was lefte for a great treaſure to the vſe of the Church, commaunding Peter and his ſucceſſors to diſtribute the ſame as good Stewardes, to ſuch as ſhould be truely repentant, and confeſſe their ſinnes, in pardoning them ſuch temporall paines as were due vnto their ſinnes, adding thereunto the merittes of the Virgin and other Saintes, ſo as this treaſure could not be drawen d
                  •
               ye. Now as hee founded the vertue of pardons vpon this decree, Luther on the other ſide maintained that there was nothing committed to Saint Peter and his ſucceſſors but the Keyes and adminiſtration of the word, by which Chriſt would that in a full affiance in him they ſhould pronounce remiſſion of ſinnes to the beleeuers: and if that the decree did agree with ſo true a ſence of the Scripture it was then good, if otherwiſe, falſe: beſides that the merittes of Saintes were cleane repugnant to the word, for what men ſoeuer they be, they doe neuer more then they ought, nay they neuer come neere their dutie, and therefore not ſaued but by the meere mercie of God. As touching that councel which approued the ſouerainty of Popes to be aboue coū
               cels, ſee what it is in the 4. &amp; 5. ſeſsion of the councell of Conſtance, as in ſundry other, it was ordained that the Pope ſhould obey the ordinances of the councell, and ratified in the 3. and 8. ſeſsion of that of Baſle, but Eugene 4. not willing to be preſent at that of Baſle, as much as he was thither cited, declaring it of no force, aſsigned another at Ferrara 1438. from Ferrara they went to Florence, where the Popes ſoueraigntye was eſtabliſhed aboue the Church and all Chriſtians, whereas Luther referred himſelfe to the Vniuerſitie of Paris, it was for that Gerſon a Doctor in Diuinity, much renowned at Paris, hauing bene at the councell of Conſtance, ſent thether among others by the vniuerſitie, and hauing greatlye allowed that decree by which the Pope was made in

ſubiection, he therin was followed by them of Paris, and a number of others, he died 1429. And before that Luther had euer put any thing in light, that Vniuerſitie had appealed from Pope Leo to a Councell, becauſe that he with Frauncis the firſt had aboliſhed La Pragmatique Sanction, verye profitable for Schollers, to whome it opened the doore of offices, charges and honors throughout the whole Realme.
            Now as ſince vpon Leo his ſending to Frederic, Charles Miltit a Germane his groom of his Chamber, with letters to ſundry other to cauſe them to abandon Luther, and Miltit ſeeing of him more ſupported, had found ſundrye meanes to appeaſe him, and reconcile himſelfe to Leo,
               Luther eager againſt the Court of Rome. had not the diſputation of Eccius at Lipſe againſt Luther, which hee grounded vpon the difference of the Popes ſupremacie, cleane daſhed all theſe hopes: for Luther not able to leaue his eagerneſſe againſt the Courte of Rome, proffered greater iniuries then euer, tearming it more wicked and corrupt then Babilon or Sodome, that ſhe was the ſincke of impiety, to wich nought could be added, and that Antechriſt put therto his helping hand: ſaying that he greatly greeued that Leo did remain among them like a Lambe among wolues. S. Bernard, quoth he, lamented the eſtate of Pope Eugene, when as Rome was leſſe filthye: but now that ſhe is the receate and bottomles gulfe of all villanies, there is much more reaſon to bewaile her: further he beſought by letters the new Emperour Charles the fift, as a puiſſance eſtabliſhed by God, to render iuſtice, and to ſupporte the weake againſt the iniurie of the more mighty, that he would protect him, conſidering that he wrote nothing but by conſtraint of his aduerſaries, and what was approued by the beſt men of knowledge in all Germany: ioyned withall that he offred to recant, if his errors might be proued: he profeſſed as much before the Electors, the B. of Magdebourg and others. In ſumme all the Princes lightly regarded it ſaue Frederic, who in the ende flatlye refuſed to ſend him to Rome, and leſſe to puniſh him. Now Frederic ſtanding in much awe of the Pope, and yet carying ſome affection to Luther, for that he ſaw him ſo much profite his Subiectes and other of his Vniuerſitie, was very deſirous that this difference might haue bene paſſed ouer with meekenes, without diſpleaſing the one ſide or the other: but being ſollicited on both partes, in the end hee reſolued to behaue himſelfe according to the aduiſe of the moſt ſufficienteſt perſonages of all his Countrie: therefore not attributing ſo great authoritie to himſelfe, as to be able alone to iudge of this doctrine, hee demaunded the opinion of ſundry aged and learned men: yea oft of ſuch Princes, Lords, and Gentlemen as were of his acquaintance: Among other hee would needs heare Eraſmus ſpeake at a Diette which the Emperour Charles the fift helde in the Cittie of Cologne, after his coronation: cauſing him then to come vnto him, hee declared amiably, that amidſt all theſe debates, hee had rather the earth ſhould open and ſwallowe him vp quicke, then cleaue to any falſe opinions, or fauour them the leaſt that might be, againſt the generall approued doctrine: but that if Luther iuſtly taxed the errors, and ſet forth the ſpringes of a more pure doctrine, he would neuer contrary the truth, what euil ſoeuer ſhould befall him or his, as hee foreſawe it, that hee would not too much ſtick to his own aduiſe,Eraſmus his opinion of Luther. but deſired to vnderſtand the minde of the more learned, coniuring Eraſmus freelye to deliuer vnto him his opinion. Who beginning his ſpeech with a kinde of ſmyling, ſaying that Luther had committed two great faults: firſt in touching the bellye of the Monkes, next the crowne of the Pope, then comming to the matter, confeſſed that Luther had great cauſe to taxe certaine errors, conſidering that faults in the Church, encreaſing by as naturall a corruption as diſeaſes did in mans bodye, reformation then was, and all times had beene neceſſarye in the Church,

but that it ought to be handled with diſcretion, without difiorming the Church, no more then mans bodie, to reſtore it to health. He added likewiſe that the ſummarye of Luthers doctrine was true, but that hee could haue wiſhed a greater temperance and modeſty in the proceeding thereof: Laurence Biſhop of Virtzbourge, wrote the very ſame to th'elector Frederic,
               Luther condemned by Pope Leo. affirming he had taken the opinion of many learned men therin, ſo as Frederic perſwaded by the authoritie of ſuch and like perſonages of valew, made afterwards no difficultie in maintayning Luther againſt the Churchmen. About the ſixt of Iulye 1520. Pope Leo hauing called together the Senate, the Colledge of Cardinalles, and a number of learned men as hee affirmed in his Letters to Frederic, ſent euery where his Bull out, in which after alleadging certaine textes of Scripture fit for his purpoſe, I pray Chriſt, ſaith hee, Saint Peter and Saint Paul, and all the hee and ſhe Saintes of Paradiſe, to turne away ſuch danger from the Church, as Luthers writinges might bring, afterwardes reciting certaine articles drawne out of his doctrine, hee reproued them, commaunding all Magiſtrates and other to ſhunne it, vnder a paine ſet downe to euery one according to his qualitie, as a thing repugnant to Chriſtian charitie, and to the reuerence which all men ought to beare towards the Sea of Rome: further willing that ſuch books of Luther as contained like doctrine, ſhould be publiquely burned: commaunding him to meddle no more with teaching; to whome he gaue threeſcore dayes to reforme himſelfe, aboliſh his bookes, and publiquely recant his doctrine, otherwiſe hee abandoned him as an Heretique and excommunicate perſon, and willed hee ſhould be puniſhed according to the lawes: forbidding all men to haunt him, comprehending vnder the ſame lawe all ſuch as ſhould doe the contrarye. But he ſtanding aduertiſed of his condemnation at Rome, repealed his appeale the ſeuenteenth of Nouember 1520. and more croſſely then euer maintained the Pope to perſiſt in his tiranny and impietie: as being ſo farre out of the way, as to haue condemned him, without calling him, hearing him or conuicting him of any errour; his appeale grounded vpon many points: Firſt, for that without hauing heard the matter, and without being conuicted, hee condemned him at his pleaſure. Secondly, that hee commaunded him to reiect all faith neceſſary to the Sacraments. Thirdly, that hee preferred his owne opinions and rauinges before the Scriptures, and that hee referred nothing to any councell, which hee offred to approue whenſoeuer it pleaſed his ſuperiours. Then hee beſought the Emperour and the reſt of the Magiſtrates, that for the honor of God and defence of a Councels libertye,Luther appealed againe from the Pope. they would receaue his appeale, that they would bridle the tirannie of the Pope, that they would not account his Bul any manner of way able to touch thē, and that they would innouate nothing, vntill the cauſe might be worthely pleaded: for all this notwhithſtanding the Pope vrged Frederic to burn all his Books, and that he ſhould either cut of his head, or making him Priſonner deliuer him vp to be punniſhed in example. Frederic praied him not to proceede ſo eagerlye, but to chooſe good and skilfull Perſonages, to confer of the whole matter amyablye to giue ſure ſafe-conduct to Luther, and that his bookes might not bee burned before hee had defended his cauſe, then if he were conuicted by ſure teſtimonies of the ſcripture, he would not approue his enterpriſe, albeit that alreadye hee conſented not to his doctrine, and though he ſhould not be able to maintain his fact, yet hee hoped the Pope would not require at his hands a matter which he could not performe: for the reſt he hoped (by Gods aſsiſtance) to fulfill the office of a Prince of th'empire and of an obedient Sonne to the Church.
            
               To which the deputies of Leo hauing in vaine replyed, the end of the conference was that neceſſity preſſed them to do according to the contents of the Popes Bull, wherfore anon after they burned Luthers bookes: then began he much more eagerlye to goe to worke,Luther publiquely burneth the cannon law and Popes Bull. for being aduertiſed of all this paſſed, hee aſſembled together all his ſchollers of Witemberge, and in the preſence of many learned perſonages, hee publiquely burned the Cannon law, togither with the Popes new Bull, the 10. of December. Afterwards to render reaſon of his exploite he alleadged theſe: Firſt, that it was an ancient cuſtome to fling corrupt bookes into the fire, as it is ſeen in the Acts of the Apoſtles: beſides, it is his part which is baptized into Chriſt, which is a profeſſor and publique teacher of the Scriptures, to combat againſt falſe doctrine, and propoſe that which is wholſome for mankinde; as touching the Pope and his ſequel, they are ſo miſerable and accurſed, that they doe not onely withſtand the holy ordinances, but condemne the doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, to make their owne ſhine for the brighter: from thēceforth he imploied himſelfe euer after to write againſt the exceſſiue abuſes and miſchiefes, which hee ſaid was in the Court and doctrine of Rome, as others on the other ſide very bitterly maintained the contrary, each with many iniuries and reciprocall inuectiues far vnworthy of Chriſtians. So as a certaine deſire of honor, ſtirred vp by a dutie to the explaining, according to his charge of the holye ſcripture, made him become ſo reſolute and ſtubborne, by the peeuiſh thwarts of his aduerſaries, that then he became open banker out to the catholicke and romain doctrine, ſo as hauing bene ſummoned to the Diet of Wormes, whither he had the Emperours ſafe-conduct, to render an account of his faith, there to be puniſhed or iuſtified according as he ſhould maintaine; he ſaid frankely the 18. of April 1521. that he would not recant one inch, except lawfully they made the contrary to appeare vnto him, being the cauſe that the Emperour on the next morrowe ſent his letters to the aſſemblye of Princes, in which hee contained that his anceſtors who had made profeſſion of Chriſtian Religion, had euer obeyed the Church of Rome: now ſince Luther oppugned the ſame, his dutye was to followe the ſteppes of his Predeceſſors, and to defende Chriſtian Religion, in ſuccouring the Church of Rome: wherefore hee determined to baniſhe Luther and his Adherents, and vſe other remedies fit for the quenching of this fire: but becauſe of his faith, which he had plighted, hee would ſend him home ſafe. The 24. of Aprill the Archbiſhop of Treuues, and other of the Lords called him to them, where after hauing wiſhed him to recant, or at the leaſt ſubmit his writinges to the iudgement of the Emperour, and of the councell of the Princes and generall councell to come: hee would not in any caſe but that all ſhould be reſolued by the authoritie of the holy ſcripture, which Eccius the Lawyer and others ſaide was not reaſonable, conſidering the diuers ſence of Scripture, which euery man interpreteth after his owne fanſie: and that further, by this meanes ſhould neuer any thing be ſure or clearely determined, that it was not to be ſuffered that euery man ſhould aske a reaſon of euery point, as of a matter impoſſible in nature. Breefe, that ſince it was not a thing reaſonable, to diſpute a matter alreadye reſolued or condemned by the Church, men ought ſimply and abſolutely to holde that doctrine which their good Fathers had left vnto them. In ſumme Charles the 5. of the age of one &amp; twenty yeares,Luther baniſhed by Charls his letters pattents at Wormes. baniſhed him the eight of May 1521. by his Letters Pattentes, by which conſidering it was his duetye to take order that no filthe ſhould enter into the Empire, by the example of his Predeceſſors; hee aſſembled all the Princes and States of the Empire at Wormes, where hee communycated the matter of Luther, and diligentlye examyned it.

Now albeit the lawes forbid to heare a manifeſt heretique, ſo many times condemned and ſeperated from the communion of the Church, yet to ſtop the paſſage to all calumnie, he ſent him a letter and diſpatched his Herald with ſafe conduct, to cauſe him to come vnto him and render account of his writings: afterwardes hauing recited the propoſitions, deſſeines, Luthers anſweres and all that had paſſed at Wormes, he ſaid that in caſe Luther did ſtill defend his errors, and wilfully perſeuere in them, he approued the Popes bul, and to witnes that he would maintain it, he cōdemned and baniſhed Luther as an author of ſchiſm, and an obſtinate heretique, cōmanding al men to hold him for ſuch: and after 21. daies which he gaue him of fauour to reclaim himſelf he charged euery man with all force to endeuour to take him and deliuer him vp into his hands: he baniſhed alſo all ſuch as any manner of way whatſoeuer fauoured him, enioyning his bookes to be vtterly aboliſhed, with great paines from thence forward for any booke-binders that ſhould ſell any of them; and ordained that his decree made in the councell of the Princes and all the eſtates ſhould remaine for euer inuiolable.
            
               Luther then much ſpiting at his hauing beene thus condemned, and his bookes burnt by the Deuines of Cologne and Louaine, after 1521. by thoſe of Paris, was at Rome giuen vp to the Diuell, the 28. of March 1521. by the Pope, togither with all heretiques, Pyrates, Impoſers of new tributes, falſefiers of Buls, Marchants furniſhing the enemies of the faith with weapons, or other thinges forbidden, Maſſacrers, poſſeſſors by violence, &amp; other which they are accuſtomed to condemn &amp; curſe the Maundy Thurſday before Eaſter, in the Bull which they call In caena Domini: Afterwards baniſhed by the Emperour in a generall aſſemblie of the Princes of th'empire: you may not doubt if he were then put into a heate to skirmiſh more eagerly then euer he did, ſo as that being publiſhed throughout, and otherwiſe pricked forward by the threates and outragious ſpeeches of Cardinall S. Kiſte and other his aduerſaries, and beſides ſeeing himſelfe ſupported as wel by Frederic Duke of Saxe his Mecenas, as many other Lords, gentlemen, and great perſonages, attempted (a matter which neuer before he durſt ſo much as haue dreamed of) cleane to aboliſh the Maſſe by his writings which he publiſhed, to that end at Witemberg. Firſt with Frederic whom by little &amp; little he gained as well by his own arguments, as by the authoritie of Philip de Melancthon, a profeſſor at Witemberge,The Maſſe firſt aboliſhed in Germany. 
               Iuſtus Ionas and other to whom this Prince had giuen in charge, to examine the conſequēce of ſo notable a change, afterwards in many places of Germany, ſo as leauing that feare which had as it were before bound him faſt with the chaines of modeſty, he durſt then make open warre againſt the Pope and all other that would maintaine his doctrine, by the ſame weapons thēſelues vſed, beginning to effectuate the Prophecie which he turned to himſelfe, of Iohn Hus &amp; Hieroſme of Prague. The Bohemians to witnes the great diſpleaſure which they conceaued at thoſe mens deaths at Conſtance, cauſed peeces of mony to be coyned which they called Huſsites, about which were engrauen thoſe words which he vttered at his departure. After one hundred yeares ye ſhal anſwere God and me. As if knowing they ſhuld liue no longer, he would haue ſaid that the Iudges ſhuld thē come before the throne of God to render an accompt of their act. But Luther interpreting it to himſelf in his commentaries vpon Daniel, taketh it for a certain prophecie that Iohn Hus ſhould be the fore-runner of his reformation, bringing in Iohn Hus, as if he ſhould ſay,Iohn Hus prophecieth of Luther. 
               they ſhall roaſt the Gooſe, (for Hus is as much to ſay as a Gooſe, in the Bohemian tongue) but they ſhall not roaſt the Swan which will come after me. Indeede hee was burned 1414. and the differēce moued by Luther vpon the pardons began 1517. Among the cheefeſt of his

aduerſaries which openly declared themſelues Henry 8. K. of England, preſented himſelfe, who aboue all the reſt diſalowed his iudgement vpon the Indulgences, defending the opinion and power of the Pope: thence he proceeded vtterly to condemne by a book dedicated to that end, all the diſputation of the Sacraments of the church, taking his argument to write vpon the Captiuity of Babilon cauſed by Luther: who thereunto anſwered very bitterlye, not ſticking to declare vnto him that hee made no account of the dignitie or magnificent apparance of any perſon. Pope Lea receaued hereat ſo great contentment, that he gaue vnto him the title of Defendor of the faith, and afterwards 1524. Clement 7. of Medices, ſent vnto him a Roſe of golde, which he had conſecrated three moneths before Eaſter.
            
               The Emperour viſiteth in perſon the K. of England.Hereupon the Emperour being embarqued to paſſe out of Germany into Spaine, where certain ſeditions were ſtirred vp, in his way viſited the K. of England, to whom the better to aſſure himſelfe of him againſt the K. of Fraunce, he promiſed the 13. of Iune 1522. at Windſor vpon the Thames beyond London, to pay annually one hundred thirtie and three thouſand crownes, which the french yearlye did owe vnto the Engliſh. And for a greater alliance it was agreed that in time and place the Emperour ſhould take in marriage Mary, daughter to K. Henry then of the age of ſeauen yeares, and that if this accord helde not, he ſhould pay foure hundred thouſand Crownes.
            
               Luthers doctrine in the meane ſeaſon diſperſed throughout Germany, profited in many places,Images broken downe in Germanie. ſo farre as his Diſciples in their abundance not content to goe any more to the Maſſe, egged the people to the plucking downe of Images, and cheefely Andre Carolaſtade, for which act being miſliked by the Vniuerſitie of Witemberg, they cō
               demned this attempt, ſhewing that it was not the way wherin they ought to proceed but before all to pull out the Images of the ſpirite, and to teach the people that onely through faith we pleaſe God,Luther miſliketh the breaking of Images by the people. and that Images ſerued to no end, which being beaten downe in the ſpirite, and men well taught, the corporall Images would ſoone fall downe of themſelues: not for any miſlike they had to haue them cleane taken away, but that it ought to be done by the hand of the Magiſtrate: for it was not permitted to euery man to do according vnto his fancy. Shortly after 1523. 1524. Zuinglius did as much at Zurich in Suizerland, and many other Cantons in like time followed after. In ſumme that a man cannot tell how lightly, how ſecretly, and in what a ſhort ſpace this doctrine crept into the harts and braines of many thouſands of Chriſtians, eſpecially then when euery one ſaw that Leo had not imployed any parte of the great maſſe of monie come of his pardons againſt the Turke, who in the meane time had ruyned Hungarie, attempted vpon Bohemia, taken Rhodes, and done a thouſand miſchiefes againſt the Chriſtians, albeit that the Pope, the Emperour, the Eccleſiaſticall Princes and others, had flung all the ſtones they could to the contrarye, euen cauſing the Edict and decree of Wormes to be obſerued againſt Luther and his doctrine, the which was notwithſtanding hindred as well by the reformed Princes and their partakers, as by the writings and ancient arguments of Luther and his companions, ſo as there is no maruell if the people,Leo 10. dieth, Adrian 6. ſucceedeth. and aboue all the comminalty of townes, not finding their paſſions ſtaied by any lawes or pollitique ordinances, licenced themſelues to growe more wilfull in their impreſsions then euer.
            
               Leo being departed, whoſe Father was Laurence, and Coſme his Grandfather, who had enobled and exalted the familie of Medices: Adrian the 6. of Vtrech in Holland, ſucceeded him 1521. as well in the dignitie, as hate and bitter purſuite againſt Luther: and the Churchmen ſeeing the protection which many Princes gained by little and little, thorough his doctrine, gaue to Luther leaſt any ſhould attempt againſt his perſon,

turning the effect of their hatred vpon his diſciplines, gaue a beginning to moſt cruell and continuall perſecutions of the euill affected towards the faith. Now as the ſeede of this reformation was taken out of the conuent of Auguſtines, ſo did they make ſeene the firſt treates of their bitter puniſhments vpon Iohn and Henry, Auguſtine Friers of Bruſſelles, who after many diſputations with Iaques Hocſtrat, the Inquiſitor a Iacobin, hauing bene depoſed of the prieſtly order, diſgraded of the leſſer orders,Adrian dieth, Clement 7 de Medices ſucceedeth. clad with laye and prophane habites, after deliuered vp to the ſecular Iuſtice, were burned aliue the firſt of Iuly 1523. Hereupon Adrian died the 13. of September 1523. to whome Clement of Medices 7. ſucceeded, vnder whome the doctrine of Luther began to creepe in amidſt the French: among whom albeit couertly and ſecretly the Lutheranes were ſoone enough ſuſpected and known: afterwards examined of their faith, were very often purſued by the Clergie, ſo as the French army being broken vp, and the King taken before Pauie by Fernand Daual Marquiſſe of Peſcaire, Charles of Bourbon, and Charles De Launoy Viceroy of Naples, 14. of Februarie 1525. who caried him priſoner into Spaine, his mother Loyſe regent in his abſence, deſiring in this ſo great an affliction, to entertaine the good fauour of Chriſtian Princes, eſpecially of the Pope, beſides the good affection and ſingular reuerence which by her letters ſhee proteſted to carrie towards the Church of Rome,Letters from the Pope to the Parliament of Paris demaunded at their hands ſuccour againſt ſuch an accident, and Councell how ſhee might ſtaie the courſe of hereſies, which were already hatched thorough out the whole Realme. Then Clement the ſeuenth beſides his priuate letters full of hope and comfort, ſignified from Rome the 20. of March 1525. to the Parliament of Paris, that he had vnderſtoode by letters from the regent, how thoſe wicked hereſies began to ſlide thorough the whole Realme; and whom by great prudence and good aduiſe, they had deputed certaine, to whom they gaue charge to ſee the puniſhment of ſuch as ſtroue to aboliſh the faith and auncient Religion: whom ſo deputed he confirmed by his owne authoritie. It is neceſſarie, ſaith he, that againſt this great and maruailous diſorder, ſprong from the malice of Satan, and the rage and impietie of his ſupporters, the whole world ſhould bend their forces, to preſerue the common health: conſidering that this forcenerie woulde not onely confound and broyle Religion, but alſo, all principalitie, Nobility, lawes, orders and degrees. For his owne parte he would neither ſpare any diligence or labor, to remedie ſuch an inconuenience: that they in like ſorte whoſe prudence and vertue hath euery where beene highly renowned, ought to employ themſelues to the preſeruing of the true and right faith: And moreouer, that to the end the weale of their Realme, and dignitie of their eſtate ſhould be exempt, from the perill and domeſticall miſteries which this pernitious and peſtilent hereſie ſowed round about, they needed not to bee pricked forwards, conſidering how great teſtimonie of their prudence they had already yeelded; yet to make his dutie appeare, and ſhew the good will which he bore vnto them he would doe no leſſe then adde this. For that which they hetherto had done, was moſt agreeable vnto him, and was the cauſe why he exhorted them, from thence forth to keep good watch againſt ſo miſchieuous a plague of heretiques, for the honour of God and ſafetie of the Realme. In ſome hee aſſured them that this their diligence ſhould bee greatly acceptable to God and worthy of much praiſe before men, that he in like ſorte would ſet to his helping hand, and giue vnto them aide and all poſsible fauour.
            Vpon this then the Diuines of Paris, during the impriſonment of King Francis the firſt tormented greatly among other, Iacques Le Feure of Eſtaples,King Francis writeth in the behalfe of Iacques Faber who hath left behinde him many bookes in Philoſophie, and Diuinitie. In ſort that hee was enforced

to retire out of Fraunce. The King aduertiſed hereof eſpecially by the recommendation of his ſiſter Marguerite, who greatly fauoured Le Feure for his vertue, ſent letters to the Parliament of Paris, in which he ſignified how hee had beene giuen to vnderſtand, that they had indited Iacques De Feure, and ſundry other of excellent knowledge before them at the purſute of the Diuines who deepely hated Le Feure, for euen before his departure out of France, ſome of that facultie had highly accuſed him before himſelfe, but wrongfully and without cauſe. That if it had beene ſo, ſaith he, he gaue charge to the greateſt perſonages and moſt notable in all erudition to canuiſſe out his bookes and writings wherewith he was charged, which they diligently executing, &amp; euery thing thoroughly examined, a moſt ample and honorable teſtimonie was deliuered vnto him touching the ſaid Feure, conſidering then that the truth is ſuch as hee did afterwards vnderſtand: that he was highly eſteemed among the Italians and Spaniards for his doctrine and vertue, he would ſtand maruailouſly diſcontented, if they ſhould offer any iniurie, or put in any danger ſo innocent a perſon. And for that, at that inſtant he ment to haue iuſtice more rightly &amp; rigorouſly adminiſtred thoroughout his Realme then before; as alſo for that he reſolued to ſhew all fauour and amitie towards learned men, to that end hee commaunded that if they had put any men of knowledge in queſtion ſince his departure, that it ſhould be ſuſpended by his mother the regent to the end he might be aduertiſed by her, and that they ſhould therein attend his intention and good pleaſure: In the meane time not to proceede any further: but ſurceaſe vntill his returne, which he hoped would be ſhortly by the grace of God, or vntill that he or his mother ſhould bee otherwiſe aduiſed. Theſe letters were diſpatched to goe from Madrila Cittie in Spaine the 12. of Nouember, and preſented vnto the Parliament of Paris the 28. of the ſame month.
            
               League betweene the regent and Henrie the 8. King of England.
               Loyſe ſhortly after ſeeing that ſhe was not able to winde the Emperour to ſuch an accord as ſhee deſired for the deliuerie of her ſonne, made alliance with Henrie the 8. King of England, about the end of Auguſt 1525. The firſt Article purported that they ſhould imploy them ſelues to the repelling of the Turkes ſtrength and courſes, together with the peſtiferous ſect of Luther, no leſſe dangerous then the Turkes. Now as the Emperour, perceiuing the King to grow verie ſicke in reſpect the pretended accord could take no good effect, feared leaſt by the encreaſing of his ſickneſſe he might looſe thorough a ſuddain death, ſo certaine aduantages as preſented themſelues he went to ſee him at Madril, comforted him and put him in better hope then euer. In the end the 14. of Ianuarie 1526. the treatie was concluded. Among the Articles whereof, it was ſpecially ſet down that the Emperours and Kings principall end was to haue the enemies of the faith and hereſies of the Lutherans cleane rooted out: And that a peace being concluded between them,Peace concluded between the Emperor Charles and Francis ye firſt they ſhould ſettle the common wealth, and vndertake a warre againſt the Turkes, and heretiques excommunicate, and cut off from the communion of the Church. A matter aboue al moſt neceſſarie, and to which the Pope had often dealt and ſollicited them to become watchfull. To ſatisfie then his good pleaſure, they reſolued to beſeech him to commaunde Embaſſadours from all Kinges and Princes, to meete at a day in ſome certaine place, with generall charge and commiſſion, to aduiſe how they might well make a war againſt the Turke and defeate the heretiques enemies of the Church, that the Pope would permit euerie Prince according to cuſtome, to leauie money in his owne Countrie, for ſo holy and charitable a worke: and alſo ſuffer them to leauie ſome diſmes vpon the Cleargie. In ſomme the Princes prepared themſelues of all handes to feaſt well the Lutherans.
            
               Their number increaſed notwithſtanding from day to day:Suiſſers reformed. eſpecially after the diſputation at Berne, whether many of the Zuiſſer Cantons ſent of their people to aunſwere, Zuinglius, Oecolampadius, Bucer, Capito, Blaurer and other. The concluſion thereof was made the 25. of Ianuarie 1528, at ſuch time as the Articles publiſhed by them were approued by the voice of the greater part, and put in practiſe by the authoritie of the Magiſtrate as well at Berne, as ſundry other places adioyning: the Maſſe, Aulters and Images being cleane put downe. They of Conſtance had alreadie made a beginning vnder Ambroſe Blaurer: But after this diſputation they did as the Bernois, and they of Baſle likewiſe in the beginning of Februarie 1529. Thoſe of Geneue did in like ſort, by reaſon whereof the Biſhop and Cleargie ſtanding terribly anangred, quitted the town 1528. Whether many French men perſecuted for their conſcience,Geneue a firſt retreate to French Lutherans. beganne as then to retire. But in Germanie the Lutherans helde vp their heade, fearing nothing but the Emperour and ſome few other, againſt whoſe enterpriſes they began already to league them ſelues. Now whereas the Emperour had aſsigned a day at Spire, to reſolue there of the matter of Religion, of the decree of Wormes, and warre againſt the Turke, it was agreed that they ſhould attend a generall Councell: and that for the decree of Wormes euery man ſhoulde in the meane time ſo gouerne himſelfe in his Religion, without altering ought in any ſort,The decree of Spire permitted euerie mā to maintaine his Religion without alteration. as he might bee able to render a good account to God and the Emperour. Before this decree 1526, the Prince of Saxe and the Landgraue, called vnto thē the deputies of Strasbourgh, Noremberg, Ausbourgh, and others to whome they deliuered, that by reaſon they ſaw the Biſhops and other Papiſtes machinate ſome thing againſt them, for cauſe of their Religion, it were good to practiſe ſome league and alliance, to the end that if any ſhould be in perill for this profeſsion, he might be ſuccored of the reſt: but there was nothing as then concluded, ſauing that the deputies hauing receiued no charge thereto, demaunded a time to communicate thereof. Now as afterwards in March 1529 they repeated in the ſelfe ſame aſſemblie at Spire, what had beene concluded touching the decree of Wormes,The beginning of the league of Smalcade among the Proteſtants. and alleaged that many abuſed the ſame (for vnder colour of the decree, men defended and excuſed all horrible doctrines) it was ordained that ſuch as vntill that time had obſerued the Emperours Edict, ſhould continue vntill a Councell, (whereof the Emperour gaue hope) and conſtraine the people to do the like, that they which had receiued other doctrine then they were able to quite, for feare of ſedition, ſhould take heed not to innouate any thing vntill then. And that their doctrine which taught otherwiſe then the Church, touching the ſupper ſhould not be receiued nor the Maſſe aboliſhed, and where there ſhould be any new faſhion of doctrine, hindering ſuch as woulde goe to Maſſe, whoſoeuer did the contrarie ſhould be proſcribed. But the 19. of Aprill, 1529. the Prince of Saxe, George of Brandebourgh, Erneſt, and Francis of Lunebourg, the Landgraue, he of Anhald oppoſed themſelues to the decree, and in writing publiſhed the occaſions of their oppoſition. Beſeeching the reſt of the Princes not to thinke amiſſe of that, if therein it agreed not iumpe with them: for as the former decree (ſaid they) was eſtabliſhed by a common accord, ſo could it not be broken without all did conſent thereunto. One partie of the principall Citties hauing conſulted together, ioyned themſelues with this proteſtation of the Princes, to wit, Strasbourg, Noremberg, Vlme, Conſtance, Ruthelin, Vuinſſeme, Merbinge, Lindaue, Campodun, Hailbrun, Iſne, Vuiſſeburg, Norling, Saint Gal, to which many more after likewiſe ioyned.Whence the name of Proteſtants firſt ſprong. And for that they all proteſted to follow the firſt decree of Wormes and reiect the new, they were alwaies after called Proteſtants. Who after that made and publiſhed an act of their appeale, containing

by order a narration of all the matter in which they appealed from the day of Spire, and decree there made to the Emperour, and a lawfull generall councell to come; or a nationall of Germanie, and in effect to all Iudges of whom there was no cauſe of ſuſpition: and thereupon they diſpatched men to the Emperour, to beſeech him not to miſlike any thing therein, and in the meane time offred vnto him all obedience, ſeruice, and other duties which hee could deſire at their handes, the which I haue beene willing to deſcribe ſomewhat at large vnto you, becauſe there will oftentimes fall out ſpeech of theſe Proteſtants and their league, whereof the matter fel out thus.
            I haue already deliuered vnto you how the Saxon and Landgraue had heere before at the ſame day of Spire, made entrance to a certain confederation and alliance, which was afterwards ſufficiently and diligently purſued, and as principallye a man aduiſeth himſelfe more vpon an occaſion then at any other time: in like manner after this decree they much more diligentlye bethought themſelues, ſo as they did ſome little matter at Noremberg, as a proiect which was ſince mightily increaſed. And in October the Deputies of theſe Princes and townes being at Schuabach, it was propoſed in the name of Frederic and George of Brandebourg, that ſince the defence of Religion was the very motiue and foundation of this alliance, it was aboue all things neceſſary that all their wils were of accorde therein: wherefore they recited a ſummarye of doctrine,The opinion of the Supper being diuers among the reformed, is cauſe of great inconueniences. which was approued of all, but they of Strasbourgh and Vlme ſaid, that in reſpect there had no mention at all bene made thereof in the precedent aſſemblie, it paſſed their charge to deale therein. The opinion of the Supper grew diuers, which was the onely hindrance thereof: the one holding the opinion of Zuinglius, that men tooke the body of Chriſt by faith: the other of Luther, that men eate it really: which being the cauſe that at that time they could not conclude of ought, they ordained an other aſſembly at Smalcade 13. of December. The Proteſtant deputies being brought into Plaiſance in Lombardie, to giue the Emperour to vnderſtand the reaſons of their appeale, had anſwere, that that was done for feare of nouelties, and to be meete as well with all kinde of ſectes to come, as ſuch as at this daye wandred throughout, and to eſtabliſh a peace in all Germanye, ſo as they ought not to make any difficultie for letting it paſſe; ioyned withall that the cuſtome did not carrye, that what was ratified by the greater parte of th'empire, ſhould be diſanulled by a few, which muſt needs cauſe him to write to the Duke of Saxe and his companions, commaunding them to conſent thereto, or elſe he would cauſe ſuch a puniſhment, as all ſhould take example thereby, which they of themſelues ought to haue done, cōſidering how much the Turk at this day waſted Hungary: &amp; albeit that they furniſhed all againſt the Infidels, yet except there were a mutuall conſent by a peace, and brotherly beneuolence among the eſtates, no thing could be brought about aduantagious againſt ſo puiſſant an enemye: the Deputies notwithſtanding gaue vp their appeale in writing, and in the end had leaue to departe, ſo as all being deliuered in councell, the 14. of October 1529. the Princes and others aſſembled towardes the end of Nouember at Smalcade, where the difference of Religion hindering as yet any reſolution, they departed vnder condition, that whoſoeuer would in each point conſent to this doctrine and receiue it, ſhould meet at Noremberg the ſixt of Ianuary 1530. there to deliberate of what were to be done. Now they concluded nothing but to tarry vntill the day which the Emperour ſhould publiſh in the Spring, which was at Ausbourg, the 8. of April 1530. Charles the fift elected Emperour in Iune 1519. at Francforde vpon the Rhyne, (notwithſtanding the contrarye purſuites of

the French for their Prince) after the death of Maximilian the 12. of Ianuary, and ſacred at Aix in the end of October, was crowned at Bologne le Graſſe the 24. of February, by Clement. And whereas vpon the 20. of Iune, when the day aſſigned by him at Ausbourg where he made his entry began, he commaunded the Duke of Saxe to carry the Sword before him going to the Maſſe, (according to the office of Marſhall to the Empire, Hereditarie to the houſe of Saxe) the Elector would firſt take the aduiſe of his Doctors, who perſwaded him that it was lawfull, conſidering that he went thither to execute his office, and not to heare the Maſſe: he was there then onely accompanied by George of Brandebourgh. After many affaires propoſed and debated, in the end he cauſed to be publiſhed this decree for religion, that hauing reiected the confeſſion of the Proteſtants faith, hee ordained in ſumme that nothing ſhould be changed in matters concerning faith and diuine ſeruice, that whoſoeuer ſhould doe the contrary, ſhould be puniſhable both in body &amp; goods, that reparation ſhould be made of all the iniuries which had beene done to the Churchmen; and to the end this decree ſhould remaine inuiolable for religion, he aſſured that he would imploye all the meanes which God had giuen him thereto, euen to the ſpending of his bloud and life: yea it was forbidden that any ſhould be able to pleade in the imperyall chamber which aſtoniſhed a great many: for the Emperour took good aſſurance of all the reſt for the execution thereof: whereupon the Proteſtants being aſſembled the 22. of December 1530. at Smalcade, concluded a forme of alyance to ſuccour one another: to the which the Princes at that inſtant bound themſelues, and with them many other Lords and free Citties, thinking good to trye therein the King of Denmarke, and Princes of Pomerania and Magdeburg, with all to write to the Kings of Fraunce and England, to diſſwade them from ſuch falſe reportes, as their enemies might make runne of them and their religion, which they accordingly did the 16. of February 1531. The Landgraue allied himſelfe with them of Zurich, Baſle, and Strasbourg, in Nouember, vpon condition to ſuccour one another for their religion; but after the breaches betweene the fiue little Cantons and the reſt (which paſſed in certaine reencounters where the reformed had the worſt) and the accord made betweene them ſince that, in October 1531. was put this clauſe, that they of Zurich, Berne, and Baſle, ſhould quit the allyance of the Landgraue, and Strasbourgh with the fiue Cantons of K. Ferdinandes. Afterwards the 29. of March 1531. they met againe at Smalcade, where they receiued but ſlender anſwers from Denmark and Pomeranye, they conſulted of meanes how to haue ſuccours ready at need, of men, monye, and munition, and for that they had had the opinion of learned men before they confederated together, and that Luther had before taught and publiſhed in writing, that it was not lawfull to reſiſt the Magiſtrate, hee now changed his minde, for when as their Lawyers did declare in this meeting that ſuch a caſe might bee offred as the Lawes permitted a man to reſiſt; as they did in this, he ſaid he was cleane ignorant of that point, for that the Goſpell did not impugne the lawes pollitick, but often times confirme them: and becauſe they ſayd that ſuch an accident might ariſe in which neceſſitie and duetie of conſcience did put the ſworde into their hands, he made a book by which he admoniſhed all men in generall not to obey the Magiſtrate,The King of Fraunce and England, ſuccour the Lutheranes. if he ſought to imploy them in ſuch a warre, for they ſtoode well aſſured how that the Emperour ſollicited by the Pope and other, went about ſome miſcheefe for them, vnder colour of hauing a care for the common wealth of Germany: King Frauncis the firſt wrote curteouſly back vnto them the 21. of April 1531. with offer of his helpe, ſo did the K. of England the 3. of May. Now after the decree of Ausbourg the Emperour being

ſollicited by the Pope and other of the Cleargye, ſeemed that he would make the Proteſtants range themſelues to the common doctrine: but for that certain Princes more peaceably addicted among the Catholicks, ſaw that that could not be brought to paſſe but with great inconueniences to all Germanye, conſidering that the Proteſtant Princes and confederate Citties had already prepared themſelues, they councelled the Emperour to aſſigne ſome daies, to examine therein their doctrine, and to ſeeke meanes of peace and accord in religion, which often had bene aſſaied and euer in vaine, by reaſon of the great difference thereof: and that the Princes (as Luther at other times had done by Pope Leo his Bull) had appealed from the Decree of Auſbourgh to a future councell, to whom properly appertained the debating of Religion. In the end notwithſtanding about the beginning of October, the Princes wrote againe to the deputies Embaſſadors for peace, that if any did thinke or could proue that their doctrine propoſed at Ausbourg were erronious in any point, or in default of ſo doing, would ſubmit himſelfe to the teſtimony of the holy Scripture, they held it moſt agreeable, that if the Emperour would aſſigne a day at Spire, and giue ſafe conduct and oſtages to themſelues,The Proteteſtants demaund of the Emperour. their aſſociates and Luther, which they ment to bring thether, beſides if he would permit their free and publique preachinges, together with the vſe of the Supper according to Chriſts inſtitution, and not conſtraine them to make difference of meates, they or their Deputies would be preſent with ful power: and if their doctrin were not confuted, they truſted the Emperour would no more hinder them in their Religion. In the mean time ſince that they had formed an appeale to a lawfull Councell, they beſought the Emperour that he would not in the meane ſeaſon innouate ought againſt them. Now beſides the point of religion, the election of Ferdinande to be K. of Romans,Election of the K. of Romanes. was propoſed by the Emperour, and couragiouſly refuſed by the Duke of Saxe, (who died about the 13. of Auguſt 1532.) and other Proteſtantes,Frederic of Saxe elector dieth. in fauour of whom the King of Fraunce had already conſigned one hundred thouſand crownes. But in the end of Iune 1534. by accord made betweene Ferdinand and the ſonne of Frederic late departed, it was ſaid among other things, that he ſhould acknowledge him for K. of Romanes without preiudice to come to the Electors,Accord between Fredederic K. of Bohemia and the D. of Saxe. and that within two moneths the Emperour ſhould ratifie the ſucceſsion of Frederic, as well to the goods of his Father as his Grandfather: and ſhould confirme the mariage paſſed with the Duke of Cleues. In ſumme the endeuourers of peace, the Biſhop of Maience and elector Palatin, preuailed ſo farre, and the Turkes comming into Auſtria more, that the Emperour to haue ſuccour of all handes,Peace thoroughout Germany and Religion free. in the beginning of Iune 1532. at a day helde at Noremberg, confirmed a generall peace throughout all Germany, with forbidding any ſhould be troubled for Religion vntill a Councell, or if that helde not, vntill the Eſtates had found meanes to appeaſe that difference, vpon greeuous paines to the breakers thereof, and promiſed himſelfe would be a meanes to the Pope, that a Councell ſhould be publiſhed within ſixe moneths, to begin one yeare after: or if the Councell ſhould not holde, aduice ſhould be taken in the imperiall daies, to reſolue the whole: to which the proteſtants promiſed to doe all dutie againſt the Turke. Concluded the 23. of Ianuarie, and ratified the ſecond of Auguſt, by the Emperour, and afterwards publiſhed, the Emperour holding a day at Ratisbone.
            Since the Emperour being returned from Vienne in Auſtria, went into Italye, where he aſſured himſelfe of Clement the 7. from thence paſſed into Spaine. Afterward Clement at the requeſt of King Frauncis, came from Genes to Marſeilles in the Automne 1533. Where to confirme a reciprocall and euerlaſting amitie, hee gaue

               Katherine his Neece to Henry Duke of Orleans, being 15. yeares of age, a mariage no leſſe coueted of the one ſide then the other. True it is that Clement would neuer aſſure himſelfe throughly thereof, vntill he ſaw them in bed togither. The K. in like ſorte (notwithſtanding any offers and aſſurances which the Emperor &amp; other Princes offered vnto the Pope, ſo as he would not perſeuere therein,) tooke no reſt vntill it was accompliſhed, as well for the dignitie and ſingular recommendation of that race, and the hope which his affaires might breede in Italye, as contrariwſe, that the Emperour might ſoone enough thereby be impayred: Now to the ende that ſuch as willinglye ſuffer themſelues to bee commaunded by their paſsions, or in like ſorte iudge euery thing according to the reporte and opinion of others, may haue the truth deliuered of what they ought to beleeue, of the houſe of Medices.
            The race hath appeared very great, highlye renowned,The race and deſcent of Medices, in which the tranſlator doth deſire the indifferēt Reader to conſider what ſcandalous libels haue of late yeares by to humorous affections bene caſt out in diſgrace of the houſe of Medices, onely to a baſe the royal race of Vallois, of this look Guicciardin in his firſt booke, &amp;c. and moſt honourable as well among the Chriſtians as many of contrary faith: be it that you looke into the Fathers ſtocke an Italian, or the Mothers a French: for the firſt being endewed with the vertues of charitie and diſcreete liberalitie (either publique or priuate) for the foundation of her greatnes, a man would iudge the pollitique gouernement of the Medices in Florence, much more worthy of praiſe, then the raigne of a number of other chriſtian Princes: their power &amp; credit increaſed by Iohn de Medices, (named of Bicci) contrary to the Nobles, who ſought cleane to ruine the whole eſtate of the towne, ſo as hauing beene preferred to all their dignities and eſtates, without euer ſuing for any one, peaceable and ſuccourable to all, hee dyed moſt rich and wealthye, freended of euery man: leauing as well for heire of his vertues as his fortune, Coſme ſurnamed the great, in reſpect he was the moſt famous perſonage, (not bearing arms) which euer was ſeene or read of in any diſcourſe, remarqued aboue all his vertues for his magnificent liberalitie, from whence all men reaped profit, and aduancement in their affaires: euen ſo farre as he made ſearch to helpe any of the Nobles, or other which he knew ſtoode in any wante, to releeue their diſſeanes, ſo as when hee was dead, the names of al his fellow Citizens were found in an inuertour which Pierre his ſonne tooke of his goods: carrying the tytle of Father of the Countrie, which the Tuſcanes cauſed to be engrauen vpon his Tombe. And albeit the life of Pierre and his vertue was much more ſhort thē was expected, he left behinde him notwithſtanding Laurence and Iulian of Medices, ſo renowned in their time, that hee being traiterouſly murthered by his enemies (leauing a Poſthumus named Clement the ſeauenth) the Prince of the Turkes would not fayle, but with ſpeede enough ſend Bernard Baudin the murtherer to Laurence to vſe him at his pleaſure, ſo much had he their honour in recommendation. But ſo greatly were his graces recommended through Italy, that euen as hee liuing, they balanced his vertue in counterweight of the vices of the Chriſtian Potentates for maintaining of whole Italye and all the Princes adioyning in peace, ſo hee being departed, all the Lordes of Italye before rayned with the brydle of his wiſe councelles, tooke ſuch a libertye to their free paſsions, that Charles the eight, drawne in by the Duke of Milan againſt the King of Aragon, for the conqueſt of Naples, and as ſoone the reſt of the Potentates banding againſt him, and ſince among themſelues Italye neuer had from that time other occaſion, then to mourne the loſſe of his preſence, whome they knewe not ſufficiently enough to honor, conſidering the greatnes of his deſerts: hee lefte behinde him Pierre, Iulian, and Iohn, which was Leo the tenth.
            So as Iulian being departed without iſſue, his goods and credite deſcended to Pierre,

though chaſed out of Florence, he was after drowned at the mouth of Gariglan, leauing for his heire Laurence of Medices, whome Pope Leo and Frauncis the firſt married to Madame Magdalaine of the houſe of Bologne in Anuergne, predeceſſors to the Q. Mother, who in ſteade of the Countie of Bologne, enioyed the County of Lauraguez in Lāguedoc; for ſo much as Lewis 11. would needs haue the County of Bologne in exchange for Lauraguez at the hands of Bertrande Earle of Anuergne, great Grandfather to the ſaide Queen. See now the race on the mother ſide, deriued from Robert the laſt of that name, Earle of Bologne and Anuergne, (whoſe anceſtors helde ranke about the Kings before the Conſtables, Chancelors, great Chamberlaynes, or other officers of the crowne) who left Guillaume and Iohn his heires: the firſte had onely Iodhe maried to Philip Duke of Burgundie, and in her ſecond marriage to Iohn K. of Fraunce, to whome by will deceaſing without iſſue, ſhe lefte the Duchie of Burgundie. And ſo the Counties of Bologne and Anuergne came to Iohn her Vnckle, who had Iohn which married Eleonor of Comminges, of whom he had Ioane, whom ſhe brought to the Caſtle of Ortais to Guſton de Foix her Coſin, brother in lawe to Charles the firſt K. of Nauarre, and left her there, fearing leaſt the Earle of Armignac who had taken from her the Earledome of Comminges ſhould take her to wife, to the end he might make himſelfe a peaceable Lord: and went her ſelfe to abide with her Vnckle the Earle of Durgel in Arragon; but her daughter was married vnto Iohn Duke of Berrie, widower of Ioane of Armignac, dying notwithſtanding without iſſue, ſucceeded vnto her in the Counties of Bologne &amp; Anuergne, Mary of Bologne her Coſin germane,The Q. Mother deſcended out of the houſe of Bologne by the mother ſide. who was married to the Lord de la Tour, and of Montgaſcon father to Bertrant de la Tour, and Gabrielle wife of Lewis de Bourbon, firſt Earle of Montpenſier, great Grandfather to the Duke liuing. Afterwards came Magdalaine wife to Laurence of Medices, anceſtors to Catherine of Medices, Q. Mother to the K. liuing at this preſent day.
            About this time the Landgraue being come into Fraunce 1533. got of the K. a maſſe of mony, to cōtinue the amitie which he carried vnto the Princes of Germany, vpon the morgage of the Countye of Montbelliard, in the name of Vlrich D. of Witemberge his Coſin, by the league of Suaube expelled his Duchie, (giuen by the ſame League to the Emperour, who ſince gaue it to Ferdinand in partage) vpon condition that if he were not repaied within three yeares, the County ſhould remain vnto him, he had beſides other monie of his liberalitie,K. Frauncis aideth the Proteſtants. and with that hee leuied men and recouered the Countrie, and placed againſt his Coſin in May 1534. Afterwards paide the firſt monye back, gratified with an ouerplus: vpon this Clement 7. who at the marriage of his Niece to pleaſure the K. had made Cardinals Odet de Chaſtillon, Philip de Bologne, Claude de Guiry, and Iohn le Venier B. of Liſeux, hauing runne ſundry fortunes died in the end of September 1534.Pope Clemēt dieth, Paul Ferneze ſucceedeth. 
               Paul Ferneze ſucceeding him, who preſently made Cardinalles Alexander ſonne to Pierre Louis his baſe ſonne, and Aſcanio, ſonne of Catherine his baſe daughter.
            As the doctrin of Luther profited in Germany, Flanders, England, Italy, &amp; cuntries adioyning, Fraunce felt it no leſſe, rather it ſeemed to increaſe by the greatnes of perſecutions, which might be ſeene, by the hotte perſecutions in the yeare 1534. for ſearches and informations were no ſooner made of the priſonners,Perſecutions in Fraunce. but they were as ſpeedily burned quicke, tyed to a ſtake, after ſwinged into the ayre, were let fall into the fire, and ſo by a pulliſe pulled vp and downe, vntill a man might ſee them all roaſted and ſcorched by a ſmall fire, without complayning, not able to ſpeak, by reaſon

that they had taken out their tongue, and gagged: Afterwards the K. to the ende that might not be a meanes of diminiſhing of the Princes of the Empire their amitye towards him, and to turne away the wrath of God which hee feared would fall vpon his Realme, for the opinion of theſe people made a ſolemne and generall proceſsion to be made at Paris, where the relique of Saint Geneuiefe patrones of the Pariſians deſcended, which happeneth but rarely. In the meane time hee excuſed himſelfe towards the Proteſtant Princes by his Embaſſadour, aſſuring them that he made them to be puniſhed for their ſedition, not for their faith; to conferre whereof hee prayed them to ſend ſome of their diuines to meete with his, for as hee ſaide Pope Leo had himſelfe heretofore tolde him, that he muſt needes acknowledge many light ceremonies and humane traditions, which were fit to be changed in time: afterwards Guillaume du Bellay called de Langeay, his Embaſſadour about them, being aſſembled 1535. at Smalcade, ſeeing that he could not conclude a generall alliance with them, (for they euer excepted the Empire and the Emperour) returned without doing ought, after hauing exhorted them in the Kings name, not to receiue Mantoue for the place of Councell which the Pope promiſed,The Pope hath no authoritie to aſſigne a councell. nor any other place without aduiſe of the K. of Fraunce and England, who would doe nothing the one without the other. Louis 12. K. of Fraunce ſaid, he by his Embaſſador in time paſt, maintained that it did not appertain to Pope Iuly to publiſh a councell, without conſent of the Emperor and chriſtian Princes, and becauſe the K. of Nauarre was of the ſame opinion, Iuly excommunicated him, and vnder this title Ferdinande K. of Spaine ſeaſed of the Kingdome of Nauarre: the K. of Fraunce is at this preſent of the ſame opinion, that he can alow of no councell but in a ſure place, not ſuſpitious, where it may be lawfull for euery man to deliuer his minde. Edward Foxe B. of Hereford, Embaſſador for the K. of England, ſpake much more affectionately, and ſhewed that his maiſter greatly affected the ſame doctrine, which he had already in a great part eſtabliſhed within his Realme, for which the proteſtant Princes humbly thanked thē, praying that they would no more ſuffer ſuch as were of like faith as they, to be perſecuted. After the 12. of December 1535. by a decree made at Smalcade on Chriſtmas euen, they renewed for ten yeares their alliance which expired at the end of that yeare, and deliberating among the reſt of prouiſion and munitions, it was there concluded that they would all receiue the confeſsion of Ausbourgh, and be content to runne the ſame race: among other there were the Princes of Pomerany, Vlrich of Witemberg, Robert of Bauiere, he of Deuxponts, the Citties of Ausbourg, Franckeforde, Campodum, Hambourg, and Hanobry, with many more, who ioyned themſelues at Franckford in April 1536. and after Guillaume de Naſſaw, and albeit that the Landgraue did not accord with them there, in reſpect of their claim which was made to the ſignory of Heſſe, yet he promiſed that if there ſhould be any outrage for the profeſsion of the Goſpel, he would not abandon them whatſoeuer enſued theron. In the end of March 1538. Chriſtian K. of Denmarck and Iohn Marqueſſe of Brandebourg, brother to the Elector, were both receued therin. Now for ſo much as Helde who had bene ſent from the Emperour to the Germane Princes, to bring them to agree to ſuch a Councell as the Pope had aſſigned, and therein to reſolue vpon all their differentes in religion, &amp;c. could gaine nothing, charging them euery way, if they refuſed ſo reaſonable conditions of Peace, hee framed a League, of which he ſaide the Emperor &amp; King Ferdinande were the authors, the aſſociates to be the Archbiſhops of Mayence, and of Salisbourg, Guillaume &amp; Louis of Bauiere, George of Saxe, Eric &amp; Henry of Brunſwich, that it was cōcluded vpon at Noremberg, vpon cōdition that if any were troubled for the ancient religion, ſuccour

ſhould be ready at hand, and to endure for 12 years vnder the name of the holy League, as made for the glory of God, and defence of the Church. Afterwards 1539. the 19. of Aprill at Francforte, the peace of Germany was accorded vpon ſuch conditions: the Emperour graunteth to the confederates of the confeſsion of Ausbourg which are at this preſent, that hee will holde a Colloquie of learned men within 15. moneths for the matter of Religion, that he will make an Edict, forbidding any to be diſquieted for their conſcience, that the accord of Noremberg and imperiall Edict of Ratisbone, ſhall remaine in full force, if within 15. moneths Religion were not fullye accorded, this peace ſhould holde vntill the firſt aſſembly of the Empire, that if a Diette ſhould happen before theſe 15. moneths were expired, then this peace ſhall take place vntill the next: the Proteſtants ſhould in like ſorte doe their duty and remaine in peace.
            To continue the paines and purſutes againſt the Lutheranes in Fraunce, after that Frauncis the firſt had ordained the like paine to the concealer as to the Lutherain, and the According to the Romaine Emperours, who named the informers quadruplatores. fourth part of his goods which was accuſed, to the informer, at Paris the 19. of Ianuary 1534. for that it was reported vnto him, that with the encreaſe of their paines encreaſed the number of Lutheranes, to diſpatch the cogniſance and iudgement of them retarded often through the differente between the royall Iudges and the eccleſiaſticall, he gaue all to the royall at firſt inſtance indifferentlye, and concurring with the ſoueraign Courtes, and without attending any degrees of appellations, as well againſt the Layety as Cleargy, not hauing ſacred orders, noble, well and free borne, or not, to the end with ſpeede to certifie the whole vp to the criminall chamber of Parlament, yea puniſhing of Iudges and inferior officers, by depriuation of their eſtates, fines or otherwiſe, as they ſaw them not to haue diligently or faithfully enough proceeded, to the accompliſhment of their proces, in ordayning as much to the Prouoſtes and other Iudges, immediatly reſorting to Soueraigne Courtes, that they ſhould ſende the enditement with the offendor, to the Bailifs, Seneſchales, or their Lieuetenants, which ſhould certifie them to the Parlament as aboue ſaid. And to all temporall ſubiects, and high Iuſticers, to make diligent inquirie of the Lutheranes, to lende a ſtrong hand, and all fauour to his Iudges, or to certifie vnto them ſuch full proceedings, as they ſhould finde againſt them as aboue ſaide: willing that in caſe of negligence or other fault, his Proctor generall ſhould take the cōcluſions, to the commitment or depriuation of the Iuſtices, and other paines as reaſon ledde them, and to all other ſecular and eccleſiaſticall ſubiects, vpon paine of incurring high treaſon, enioyning both his generall and perticular, Proctors and Aduocates, to aduertiſe him what they ſhould doe from ſixe moneths to ſix moneths, vpon paine of ſuſpending of their eſtates for the firſt crime, and depriuation for the ſecond, with condign recompence if they perfourmed their dutie, towardes the rooting out of ſuch and like hereſies: not meaning thereby that the Prelates, Clergie, their officials, Vicars, and inquiſitors of the faith ſhould ceaſe,, to informe and proceed againſt their owne ſubiectes and iuſticiables, hauing ſacred orders, ſubiect to degradation, being culpable of the ſectes and hereſies vpon the common faulte, but exhorted them to doe it, and to their iuſticers gaue all aide and fauour. At Fountanebleau the firſt of Iune 1542. Afterwards from Lyons the 30. of Auguſt, hee commaunded his Parlament of Paris to ſearch out and puniſhe the aſſemblye of Lutheranes, in their reſortes, and gaue like charge to them of the Church to doe the like who from foure moneths to foure moneths were to certifie the Parlament, of their diligence in this behalfe.
            
               In Ianuary 1540.The Emperours Interim. there was a day aſsigned by the Emperour at Ratisbone for a peace to be concluded throughout Germany, and a vnion of faith, and in the meane time was a colloquie at Wormes, to prepare the accorde, but being broken by the Emperours Letters, the whole was referred to Ratisbone, in Aprill whether the Emperour came in perſon, in whoſe name his dutie towardes the Common wealth, hauing beene propoſed, and certaine Diuines choſen on the one ſide and the other, for to conferre with the Preſidents, witneſſes and Notaires the 27. of Aprill, Granuelle offred vnto them all a booke in written hand, which he ſaid had beene preſented vnto the Emperour, by certaine well affected and learned men, as a matter proper to make both parties of accorde, containing the principall points of the doctrine: wherfore the Emperour was willing, to the end they might haue a lawfull argument, and good entrance to the matter, that both parties ſhould examine it together: approuing and reprouing as beſt ſeemed good vnto them: it was in ſome corrected, and certaine articles approued, other not: ſo as contrary to the Catholique Princes minds, and to Conteran the Popes Embaſſador, (who ſaide they would not change ought of the Religion already receaued, that the matter of religion ought not to bee determined but by a Councell, and the whole ſhould be ſent backe to the Pope, who for that end had promiſed one) the Emperour made a decree the 28. of Iuly 1541. by which hee put ouer the colloquie of the learned men, and all the affayres to a Councell, and for defaulte thereof, becauſe an opinion was helde that the Pope would ſhun it by many delayes, to an aſſemblye of all Germany, or the eſtates of the whole Empire, hee promiſed to ſollicite the Pope for a Councell, and in defaulte of a generall or prouinciall, hee would ordaine a day imperiall within 18 moneths, to accord Religion, and that the Pope ſhould ſend thither his Embaſſadour, commaunding the Proteſtants not to innouate ought from the accorded articles, which ſhould ſtand in force vntill then, and further ſuſpend the decree of Ausbourge, enioyning the cleargie to reforme their life, their abuſes, and Churches after all, one ſide and the other promiſed ſuccours againſt the Turke, which was come downe into Hungarie &amp; Auſtria, and had ſeaſed vpon Bude, Hungarie, and Peſt, hauing defeated the army of Ferdinande, with great mortalitie of the Chriſtians, while that their Princes ſtood diſputing and quareling together, like people irreconciliable. This was alſo confirmed in a daye at Spire, in Iune 1544. And other daye was helde at Wormes in Aprill and May 1545. where the Emperour referring the matter of Religion to a Councell, (for the Pope had courſed him that he ſhould vndertake to decide the matter of religion by a conference of Laye men, appertaining onely to him) would meddle only in taking order againſt the Turke: the Proteſtants contrariwiſe ſaide,The Proteſtants oppoſe themſelues to the decree of the Emperour. that they would contribute nothing towards it, and much leſſe goe themſelues, if they had not firſt an accord or an aſſured peace for Religion, by reaſon of which, their wiues, children, and ſubiects, might be tormented in their abſence: ſo as nothing being done, the Emperour ordained a Colloquie for Religion at Ratisbone among the beſt learned, in December 1546. where the Diſputers, witneſſes, and auditors, being choſen, the Saxon ſaide that he would not approue of the conditions of the colloquie and reuoked his people, after the Landgraue and other of the Proteſtants did the like, promiſing to returne if the colloquie continued. Hereupon the councel of Trent, publiſhed the yere paſſed on the 15. of March, began in the end of the yeare 1546. The Pope hauing ſent thither as his Legats, Iohn Maria de Monte, Marcel Seruin,
               Councell of Trent. and Reinold Pole an Engliſhmā all Cardinals, Iacques Mendoſe came thither to excuſe the emperours abſence, vpon the teſtimony which he had often rēdred of his diligence in purchaſing of that aſſembly,

and his dutie and obedience towards the holy Sea, and that which ſhould be ordayned. But more then the Monkes orations to the fathers, and publication of the Bul of the Popes great pardons, there was nothing done, becauſe the Fathers haſtned no whit thither, ſauing that the 7. of Ianuary where beſides the Cardinalles, were foure Archbiſhops, thirtie three Biſhops, two French, fiue Spaniards, one Illiric, the other Italians, thirtie fiue Monkes, and twelue not Monkes: as the number of Biſhoppes grewe ſomewhat greater the Councell began, and after they were all aſſembled in the great Temple, and that Maſſe was ſaide, the Legats read their Orations to the Fathers. Afterwards it was declared how that the Councell was helde for three cauſes: to roote out hereſies, reſtore the diſcipline of the Church, and recouer peace: vpon that they ſaid that the fault of the preſent calamitie ought to be imputed to the Eccleſiaſticall eſtate, conſidering that none did their dutie, nor diligent to labour in the fielde of the Lord, whence hereſies ſprung vp like thornes, and albeit that they were not of their owne parte the inuenters of any hereſies, yet they were to be charged for not well tylling of the Vineyard, they haue not ſowen the fielde, they haue not plucked vp the Darnell which began to ſpring vp, that they then ought to aduiſe, and euery man to examine his owne conſcience, and trye if he haue perfourmed his dutie: it is certaine that they were to be blamed, for that all the diſcipline of the Church had been ſo trodden vnder foot: the third euill is warre, which is a puniſhment ſent from God, in reſpect of careleſneſſe in religion and want of diſcipline: for Chriſtendome ſtandeth not onely inuaded by Turkes and ſtrangers, but alſo by ciuil and domeſticall armes: during that the Kings combate, or that they which are reuolted from the obedience of their Paſtors, doe ouerthrowe all order, and pyll the goods of the Church, they haue adminiſtred the occaſion to the euils, by their moſt wicked example of life through ambition and couetouſnes. God then is the iuſt Iudge, which afflicteth them by theſe meanes, and yet the paine is much more gentle then their deſerte. True it is that ſuch are happy as endure for righteouſnes ſake, which may not be applyed to thoſe which are worthye of more rude chaſtiſement, that euery one then acknowledge his ſinne, and endeuour to appeaſe the wrath of God: for if they doe not acknowledge that, there will neuer be any amendment, and for no end ſhall the Councell be helde, and in vaine ſhall the ayde of the holye Ghoſt bee called vpon, it is a ſingular benefite of God, to haue giuen vnto vs the meanes to begin a councell, after the Church deliuered from ſo long and greeuous a ſhipwrack, taking harbour, is no more nor leſſe reſtored, then was Hieruſalem after ſo long a captiuitye. Eſdras, Nehemias, and the other Captaines, being returned out of Iudea, earneſtly admoniſhed the people of Iſrael, to confeſſe their owne ſinnes and their Fathers, and to call vpon the diuine mercie, we ought to follow the like example. He found in that time ſcoffers, which ſought to hinder, and mocked the Iewes, which reedified the Cittie of Hieruſalem: we in our time haue no want of people, which vndertake the like, and in effect perfourme it: but we muſt march on hardly, in the aſſurance of Chriſt, whoſe commaundement is heere executed, and the buſines ſet in hand. But for ſo much they are heere as Iudges, they ought well to aduiſe, not to ſuffer themſelues to be ledde by their affections, but holde themſelues neate from the hatred of wrath and enmitie, not ordaining ought to pleaſe man in this world, nor accommodating themſelues to the eares or deſire of any perſon, but contrariwiſe yeeld all honor and glory to God alone: for all eſtates are ſtraied out of the right way, and there is none which doth good. God himſelfe and his Angels are the beholders of this aſſembly, and there is no thought of any the aſſiſtantes, which is hid

from him, that they ſhould then proceede roundly and ſoundly, and that the Biſhops which are ſent from Kinges and Princes ſhould ſo furniſhe their charges, that aboue all thinges they haue the reuerence and honor of God before their eyes, without reſpect of hatred or fauour: for conſidering the aſſembly is helde to eſtabliſh peace, they muſt caſt farre from them all contention and partialitye. The Oration finiſhed, the decree of the Synod was read by Iohn Fonſeca B. of Caſtrimare, a Spaniard, by which all Chriſtians were admoniſhed to amend their liues, feare God, often confeſſe themſelues, and often viſite the Monaſteries of Saintes,Decree of the Councell of Trent. that they ſhould pray to God for a publique peace; that the Biſhops and other Prieſtes ſhould be attentiue to praiers, and ſay Maſſe at the leaſt euery Sunday, praying for the Pope, Emperour, and whole Chriſtendome: that they likewiſe exerciſe themſelues in faſting and doing of almes in the great Temple; that euery Thurſday in the weeke they ſay a Maſſe of the holy Ghoſt, and during the ſaying thereof, that all be attentiue to the Prieſt, eſpecially in time of the Sacrifice, and that they keepe themſelues from chatting; that the Biſhops liue ſoberly, taking away all ſuperfluitie of their tables, ſhunning all idle and light diſcourſe, that they accuſtome their people to like diſcipline, in ſorte that they ſhew themſelues honeſt in words, apparell, and whatſoeuer they ſhall doe. And for ſo much as the end of the Councell is to endeuour that the darkenes of errors and hereſies, which ſince a good while haue raigned vpon the earth, being chaſed away, the light of the truth may ſhine forth; all are admoniſhed, and eſpecially men of knowledge, carefully to aduiſe by what meanes this may be brought to paſſe, in deliuering of their opinions that they followe the decree of the Councell of Toledo, and doe all thinges modeſtlye without cryes, nor be riotous or obſtinate, but pronounce all ſweetely and leaſurely. The other Seſsion was the fourth of Februarye, where nothing was diſpatched nor reſolued, ſaue onelye that they confeſſed the Creede of the faith, and put ouer the other Seſsion vntill the eight of Aprill, by reaſon of ſuch as were already on their way, whom they thought good to attend, to the end the authority of the decrees might be of greater waight.
            During this Councell, Luther of the age of threeſcore and three yeares,Martin Luther dieth 1546. ſicke of a diſeaſe in his ſtomacke, dyed the 18. of February 1546. at Illebe in the Countye of Mansfielde, whether he was gone to appeaſe certaine differents which were between the Counts for their liuings and inheritance, in forme of an amiable compounder and Arbitrator. And albeit they deſired they might bury him in their Countrye, yet the Elector of Saxe would needs haue him brought to Witemberg. He left of a Nunne which he married 1505. Iohn, Martin, and Paul, his children, which haue not followed any courſe, either for the diminiſhing or encreaſe of his reputation.
            Hereupon to confirme the ſuſpitions which many had of a warre at hand for Religion in Germany, were ſeene the firſt effects in the holy League of the Imperialles, and that of the Proteſtants made and renewed at Smalcade as I haue declared vnto you.
            Moreouer the Emperour being from day to day egged forward by the Pope and Catholick Princes, now diſcouering himſelf, writeth to the cities of Strasbourg,The Emperour writeth to the townes for ſuccour. Noremberg, Ausbourg, and Vlme, to aduertiſe them of his entent, and drawe ſuccour from them, at the leaſt not to fauour the enemies of the common Countrie, and of Chriſtian Religion, giuing them to vnderſtand, after he had made them ſee what his dutie and affection was to the good of the common wealth of Germany, how this warre was not prepared againſt the Citties, but againſt certaine rebels, which had committed treaſon, who had confronted the authoritie of the Emperour, pilled the

goods of Princes and of the Church, and would in the end the townes too, if they were not bemet withall: that they ſhould then aduiſe themſelues well of their dutie, both towards him and the common countrie; who, and eſpecially Strasbourge, beſought him to leaue off this preparation of warre, and if the Princes had done him wronge,The townes ſend anſwers. rather to order them by iuſtice, then by armes to ruine all Germany, conſidering that all differents betweene an Emperour and the Princes ought to be adiudged by the Empire. Now as the Landgraue, being called for by him, had in familiar ſpeeche at Ratisbone (where the continuance of the Colloquie was aſsigned) tolde him that his companions had beene aduertiſed from all partes,Speach betweene the Emperour and Landgraue. how he meant cleane to runne ouer thoſe of the confeſsion of Ausbourg, how he attended ſuccours from the K. of Fraunce, &amp; how he had made truce for one yeare with the turk, by means of the French, and that this councell had beene begun by the Pope, to the end the decrees made againſt them might be put in execution, notwithſtanding that they had yeelded him ſuccour againſt the Turk and King of Fraunce, and that as wel at Spire as at Ratisbone he had aſſured thē of a firme peace, albeit they could not accord of religion, he anſwered that he neuer thought it, praying them not to beleeue ſuch reportes: that he had made peace with the French, it was all, and truce with the Turke to make poore Germany take ſo much more breath, to the end that during this truce they might make ready to ouerrunne the Turke, when it ſhould be extermined conſidering cheefely that they aboue all, had ſo oftentimes lamented the miſery of Germanie: but that the councell helde to determine the matter of Religion as they had ſo often required. And after that the Landgraue had replied, that there could bee no good concluded for them, conſidering the Pope their mortall enemy commaunded there, and that euen the Monkes called againe there in doubt the articles accorded, that they were promiſed a free and ſure on in Germany, together with the reformation of the Imperiall chamber ſo bitter againſt them, and that hardlye they could ſend their Doctors, much leſſe come themſelues to Ratisbone as the Emperour deſired, for the reaſons which he alleadged, he retyred himſelfe into his Countrie, and anon after their Deputies at Wormes hauing intelligence of this communication, ſlunk away the 23. of Aprill, the 8. whereof the fathers cōcluded vpon certain points, but of the generall ſorte and leaſt controverſied in the Church. In ſumme the holye league was ſet downe in writing, and after the 26. of Iune 1546. proclaimed, by which the Pope conſigned one hundred and 50000.The holy league betweene Pope, Emperour, and other Princes. Crowns at Venice, ouer &amp; aboue one hundred thouſand already giuen, and furniſhed twelue thouſand Italian Fantaſſins and 500. Horſe, paide for ſixe monthes, permitting vnto the Emperour to take for that yeare the moitie of the reuenew of the churchmen in Spaine, and to ſel as much of the yearelye rents of the Monaſteries of Spaine, as amounted vnto fiue hundred thouſand Crownes, ſo as he employed them onely in this war: vpon condition that hee ſhould morgage as much of his own demaine, for which he ſhould make aſſurance, to the Popes good liking. Vpon this Vlrich of Witemberg, and the Citties of high Germanie were firſt in armes againſt the Emperour, after the Princes ioyned themſelues, the Elector Palatine ſtanding neutrall, praied them to ſubmit themſelues, and demaund pardon of the Emperour. They, the Emperour, and Pope, entreated the Zuizers to ſtand Neutrall. The Proteſtants ſought ſuccours of the K. of Fraunce and England. Now the Emperour ſought to hide his game, vntill his forces might be in readines, namely, the Italians which were to paſſe the Alpes, where the paſſages are eaſie to be kept, for there are but two to goe into Germany, from Trent to Enipont. To goe from thence into Bauiere where the Emperour was, ſtoode at the parting of

the Mountaines, Ereberge, a forte almoſt impregnable, Shartelin a Proteſtant Captaine ſeaſed thereof, and had done as much as Enipont,

                  The Emperor baniſheth and condemneth the D. of Saxe. Proteſtants defie the Emperour.
                  The Emperors deuice to draw Maurice againſt his Coſin Elector of Saxe.
                had not the ſubiects of K. Ferdinand riſen. So the Italians came vnder Octauian Farneze Cardinall, with many renowmed Captaines: Coſme of Medices ioyned therto 200. Horſe of ordinance: Hercules Duke of Ferarra 100. vnder Alphonſo his baſe brother: the 20. of Iuly the Emperour banniſhed the Saxon and Landgraue by his letters Pattents, in which hee declared the reaſon at large, as periured perſons, rebels, ſeditious, guiltie of treaſon, and diſturbers of the publique tranquilitie, whome he determined to chaſtice according to their deſerte, withall thoſe that ſhould take their parte. And the 12. of Auguſt the Proteſtants ſent him letters of defiance, naming him but Charles pretending himſelfe Emperour. Vpon this the Emperour ſent the firſt of Auguſt the copie of their baniſhment to Maurice, who hauing talked very familiarly with the Emperour, went home, and thence to Prague towards Ferdinande. Now for that he was neer kinſeman to the banniſhed, in ſorte that he might pretend ſome right to their goods, he commaunded him and his brother Auguſtus to ſeaſe thereon, otherwſe it ſhould be to the firſt occupier: in ſorte that the right of conſanguinitie and contracts ſhould nothing at al ſerue his turne, ioyned withall that hee ſhould be comprehended vnder the ſame paine, as hauing bene diſobedient vnto him: and commaunded the Nobilitie, and people to fulfill his commandement.
            The two armies being incamped before Ingolſtat vpon the Danube,The Proteſtants fault and error. the Proteſtantes were the ſtronger in number of horſe and artillerie, but the Emperour had more Fantaſſins, Lords, and Captaines of Marke. In ſumme, the Proteſtants loſt there a faire occaſion, to haue broken the Emperour, who yet had not his campe well entrenched, nor the ſuccour of ten thouſand Fantaſſins, and foure thouſand Horſe, which the Counte de Bure brought vnto him, they alſo loſt the time at Nerlinge, ſo as the Emperour being ſeaſed of the places bordring of Danube, and hauing it ſo at his deuotion, as he could cauſe all ſorte of victuall to be brought, purſued them then with great aduantage: for they ill husbanding the opportunities which preſented themſelues, and adding thereunto that they were two heads equall, and banded in their opinions, Schertelin firſt, afterwards other, retyred themſelues from them. Maurice in the meane time had praied his Coſin the D. of Saxe by his Father in lawe the Landgraue, to take in good parte that he ſeaſed of his liuing, but perceiuing himſelfe refuſed, ioyned with Ferdinande, who to enforce the Bohemians to ouerrunne Saxe, (vtterly refuſing it, conſidering the alliance which they had made with that houſe, and for that they verilye thought hee had wrong doone him) cauſed his cauallerie of Huſsaries of Hungaries to come downe, and ſome Sileſians,Maurice warreth againſt his coſin and the Proteſtants. with whome he put all Saxe to fire and ſworde: Maurice euer ſaying, that hee had rather ſeaſe thereof himſelfe then a ſtraunger ſhould, conſidering that the mynes of ſiluer were common to him with his couſin, and that his landes were ſhutte in within the others, which hee made ſure by this meanes: beſides that hee did nothing but by the aduiſe of the eſtates, who had written to that end to his Coſin: and further that the Emperour had ſworne vnto him, that hee ment no harme but to the Rebels, and not to Religion: wherefore in all caſes the faith excepted, one ought to obeye that Magiſtrate, which ſuffered in his Countrie the exerciſe of religion; and ſo determined to purſue his owne right, and the differentes which ſo long time he had had with the Elector, fearing leaſt his landes ſhould fall into the handes of Strangers: offering when hee ſhould be reconciled to the Emperour and Ferdinand, that he would reſtore vp al vnto him, whereof he certified his Coſin and his Sonne, ſo as the Hungarians following

of him, he tooke all the places except Gothe-aenac and Witemberge, binding all the ſubiects to ſweate vnto him. For which he was miſliked by euery man, rendring ſo poore a recompence vnto him, whom he ought to haue held for a father, &amp; author of all his good. He was ſonne to Henrie, whoſe brother George Duke of Saxe, had ordained by his teſtament, that the Emperour ſhould enioye his prouince vntill that his brother had renounced the Proteſtant Religion: But the Elector and Landgraue hindered it, making his teſtament to be broken, &amp; tooke Henrie and his children into their league. Moreouer whreas George had giuen vnto him a penſion in mony, &amp; that they feared for ſpight of Religion he would refuſe to pay it, the Proteſtants promiſed him in caſe it ſhould ſo fall out, to furniſh the ſomme vnto him themſelues, ſo the Saxon being called on that ſide, and ſeeing the Landgraue (hauing left vnto him his people) retyre himſelfe, and that the Allies furniſhed no more ſupplies, hee went aganſt Maurice, out of whoſe hands in the end he got againe all the places, and tooke a number of his people, and whatſoeuer Ferdinand had taken from him, ſhutting both them into Bohemia, he ſubiected to himſelfe alſo the Biſhoppricke of Magdeburg, and Halbeſtat, hauing conuented with Iohn Albert the Biſhop. The Emperour in the meane time triumphed thoroughout Germanie, ordayning and impoſing great ranſomes to al the Princes, and Proteſtant Cities, euen to the Elector Palatine, who before as a Neutre, was readye to haue reformed his Churches by Paul Faggius, had not this accident fallen out, and was faine to haue pardon of the Emperour for the 400. horſe which hee had ſent to the Proteſtants: albeit hee proteſted that it was not ment againſt him, but by right of Obligation, carried by a particular contract with the Duke of Witemberg. Whome likewiſe, and his ſonne Christopher hee pardoned, but woulde not his brother George, all renouncing the Leage, and not ſpeaking of Religion.
            Afterwards the Emperour purſuing of the Saxon, the 22. of Aprill 1547. ariued at Miſnes which Frederic had quit, and burning the woodden bridge, encamped himſelfe at Mulburge neare the riuer of Albye; the Emperour ſtill haſtening for feare he ſhould encloſe himſelfe within Witemberg. So as with a thouſand Spaniſh Harquebuſiers, which waded into the water, to paſſe forward, he aſſailed the garde on the other ſhoare notwithſtanding the Cannon ſhot, which ſhowred downe on euerie ſide. Afterwards with the ſmall Boates which Frederic had abandoned, hee made a bridge, ouer which the Hungarians of Ferdinand and the light horſe paſſed firſt, followed with the reſt, haſtning to follow Frederic, who was reencountred 3. leagues from Albye, neare the forreſt Lochane, where hee charged him ſo hard, that after a long combat, he was defeated, hurt, taken and brought by the Duke of Alua vnto him,The Elector hurt taken &amp; broght to the Emperour. to whome hauing ſaid, I render my ſelfe thy priſonner, moſt mercifull Emperour; and pray thee to giue me entertainment worthy of a Prince, he anſwered. Now then thou doeſt acknowledge me an Emperour, but I wil handle thee according to thy deſert. Shortly after being condemned to death, the Elector of Brandebourge ſo much appeaſed the Emperour, that he had his life, not refuſing any conditions offred vnto him, ſauing to obey the Emperours ordinances or the Councell, chuſing rather to die. It was then ordained that the Emperour ſhould confiſcate all his goods, which he gaue to Ferdinand and Maurice, vpon condition that Maurice ſhould yeerely pay vnto the Saxon and his children fiftie thouſand crownes. If it ſo ſeemed good to the Emperour and Maurice, he ſhould enioy Gote, ſo as he rayſed the Caſtle and fortefied not the Towne. And for that hee was much in debt, Maurice ſhould giue vnto his children one hundred thouſand crownes, to be employed to the payment of his debtes

growne before the league of Smalcade: and that Maurice ſhould diſcharge all ſuch debts as his lands, which had beene confiſcat, and giuen vnto him by the Emperour were lyable vnto: And ſo all ſuites to be had at an ende, and his children to haue the vſufruite of the goods mentioned, if they approued theſe conditions, and the people likewiſe. And in reſpect his life was ſaued, he ſhould for euer after remaine priſoner to the Emperour, and to his ſonne the Prince of Spaine. Hee ſurrendred likewiſe his right and dignitie of Elector into the handes of the Emperour, who put Maurice as well in poſſeſsion of the dignitie as lands of Frederic. And by his decree it was ordayned, that if the other ſhould chaunce to dye without heires maſles, Auguſtus his brother and his children ſhould be in remainder thereunto, which was doone the 24. of Februarie 1548. at Witemberge. Frederic regarding the ceremonies of his houſe all the Electors preſent, the Landgraue vnder ſuertie of Brandebourge, Maurice, and Volfange his ſonnes in law, rendred himſelfe almoſt to the diſcretion of the Emperour, who afterwards propoſed a league at Vlme, to appeaſe all ſuch troubles as might enſue either for Religion or otherwiſe: But the whole was referred to Ausbourge. Hereupon the Landgraue hauing demaunded, and receiued pardon, and promiſe that he ſhould not remaine priſoner, was ſtayed and commaunded to follow the Emperour, after that he had accompliſhed all the reſt of the conditions.Great ranſomes which the Emperour had of the Germaines. For which Maurice and Brandebourge, being his ſuerties for his libertie grew in great rage; ſo as the Emperour to defraye the expence of his warre got, what with theſe ranſomes, and otherwiſe among the Catholiques, and Lutherans aboue ſixtene hundred thouſand crownes, and well fiue hundred peces of Artillerie, which hee ſent into Spaine, Naples, Milan, and the low countrie.
            The Emperour after theſe victories aſsigned a day firſt at Vlme,The Emperor would haue the Councell remoued frō Bolonia to Treat. then at Ausbourg to accord points in Religion, reforme the Iuſtice of the chamber, &amp; obey the Councell. The Palatin, Maurice, and Brandebourge would not conſent to any but in place free and ſure. In the end, that thereby they might the ſooner get the Landgraue out of priſon they accorded one, and by their example, the more reſolute Citties, by writing graunted ſomewhat of their demaunde: So as the Emperor being very ioyfull thereof, made great inſtance towardes the Pope, that hee woulde remoue the Councell to Trent from Bologne where he had appointed it to be held 1544. in reſpect of the vnholſomnes of the aire ſaid Hieroſme Fracaſtor who monthly had a great penſion from him. And vpon the difficultie which the Pope made therein, hee ſent Mendoza to proteſt of his parte before the Pope, and the reſt of Bologne, that hee held of no account whatſoeuer ſhould be there concluded: declaring that he would prouide thereto well enough, by a lawfull conuocation of the eſtates of Germanie, 1548 which were of his very opinion being aſſembled at Ausbourge. And further for that he would not haue the Councell to bee cleane in diſpaire of being held, the delaying thereof ſo much importing him, when as power was giuen vnto him to chuſe the Collocutors, Iudges, and witneſſes, he tooke Iules Flug Biſhoppe of Numbourg, Michael of Sidoine, Iohn Alebe Agricola, who 18. yeares before had beene a Lutheran, Melancthon, and Brence, who very ſecretly wrote a Booke of Religion, and after they had againe peruſed and corrected it, preſented it vnto him: But Bucer finding many things contained therin, refuſed to ſigne it, ſaying that the Popes doctrine was there manifeſtly confirmed, and ſince that in like ſorte they added ſundrie other things: So as both the Pope and Proteſtants alowed of it, albeit ſmall reformation was had therein of any ſuch Articles as were generally receiued of the Catholiques. Romee generall of the Iacobins wrote againſt it at Rome, and ſo did Robert Biſhoppe

of Auranches in Fraunce, for that this booke permitted marriage to Prieſts, and the Supper vnder both kindes. The Emperour notwithſtanding preſſed the eſtates hard to ſticke faſt vnto it, and not to innouate any thing either in their preachings or writings to the contrarie, attending the decree of a Councell. Afterwards the fiftenth of May the Archbiſhop of Mayence cheefe of the Electors, thanked him for his ſo great care of the publike, in the name of them all, and ſaide that all ought to obey his decree: The which he accounted as a common approbation, and woulde not for euer after admit of any other reaſon or excuſe to the contrarie, whoſoeuer would ſay that they had not conſented thereunto: In ſort that he cauſed it to be imprinted both in the Latine, and vulgar Germaine tongs. Fower daies after he beſought the eſtates to contribute by hed, towardes the remedying of ſuch inconueniences, as either for Religion or otherwiſe might fall out in the common wealth, and that the money might bee reſerued as a publike treaſor in ſome places fitteſt for that purpoſe, to haue ſuccours readie at neede: and Ferdinand required as much to releeue him againſt the Turke the fiue yeares of truce being expired. Afterwardes the Emperour ſomewhat and ſuperficially reformed the ſtate of the Church about the end of Iune 1548. and cauſed a Booke to be imprinted: Maurice departing from Ausbourge about the end of 1548. went into his owne countrie, where his eſtates vrging him with his promiſe to maintaine among them the pure confeſsion of Ausbourge, in the end hee cauſed to be made a forme of Religion which all ought to holde: from whence great Scandale aroſe. All the Princes and Cities except Breme, and Magdebourge conſented to the decree of Ausbourge, an occaſion that the latter was by the Emperour expoſed as a pray to all ſuch as would warre vpon him in the yeare 1549. Now as this decree of Ausbourge was alreadie as it were generally receiued throughout all Germany, ſo greatly did the victorie and Spaniſh Garriſons of the Emperour, together with the Saxons and Landgraues impriſonment, aſtoniſh the people, at ſuch time eſpecially when there was an apparant chaunge of Religion thoroughout all the countries of Maurice, the miniſters of the Churches of Lubec, Lunebourg, and Hambourge confuted well at length the Booke and decree of Ausbourge, by another contrarie, which they cauſed to be put in printe, whereof Iohn Epin was the principall author. Shortly after the Doctors of Magdebourge, Nicholas Amſtroff, and aboue all Mathias Flaccius an Illiricque, borne in the Citie of Albonne, who ſince was one of the principall authors of the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie of Magdebourge, and Nicolas Le Cocq oppoſed themſelues ſtoutly againſt them of Witemberge and Lipſa, and condemned them in ſundrie printed Bookes as diſſemblers, ouer ſimple, to timorous, and by indifferent and meane things how they had made a high way to the papiſticall Religion: the which at the firſt proceeding from a good beginning, grew in ſimplicitie, afterwards ſuffered it ſelfe to corrupt thorough a diſordinate lycence of ſuch thinges among the Chriſtians of the primitiue Church: who ouercome by little and little, with to great a feare of diſpleaſing, and roundly reſiſting ſuch as at the firſt woulde bring in their fantaſies for ſure rules of Faith, in the end cleane marred, vnder a Maske of things indifferent and ſuch like humaine traditions, the true and pure worde of God. For concluſion they ſet downe this rule, that all ceremonies and faſhions, how indifferent ſoeuer they may be of themſelues, are no more neare at this preſent, conſidering that the vertue, opinion and neceſsitie of ſeruice is now annexed thereunto, and that the occaſion of impietie is yeelded thereby. Illiricque one of the authors of this learned and laborious Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie, had beene certaine yeares an Auditor and Diſciple of Melancthon: but in this different, retyred himſelfe to Magdebourge:

and cauſed a Book to be imprinted wherein he rendred the reaſon of his act. They of Hambrough wrote likewiſe to them of Witemberg, &amp; eſpecially to Phillip Melancthon, making a Catalogue of ſuch things as they termed Neuter, or indifferent, &amp; ſetting downe what might bee receiued, and together prayed them to write openly of their ſide, what they would haue comprehended vnder that name, to the end men might agree on ſomwhat, &amp; follow it without varying. And for feare leaſt the name of Neutralitie might giue occaſion to ſundry other errors, which by little and little might bee engraued in the braines of men, Melancthon, a man ſweete; fearefull,Melancthons anſwere and a great enemie to all ryots, anſwered among other thinges that ſome ſeruitude might well be borne, prouided that it were without any impietie.
            Now not to long to leaue behinde, the perſecution of the Catholikes againſt the Lutherans in the Realme of France,Perſecution of Lutherans. K. Henry ſeeing at Paris the 19 of Nouember 1549. the Edicts of his father very euill executed by the negligēce of the Eccleſiaſtical Iudges which was complained of vnto him (cōtending with the ſoueraigne courts &amp; other Iudges of their natural iuriſdictions &amp; powers) ordained the better to cōforme himſelfe to the title of Thriſe-Christian: that the Royal iudges ſhould take knowledge, ioyntly of the ſaid faults as the caſes ſhoulde offer thēſelues: as touching the information &amp; decree only, after hauing well executed the decree, &amp; examined the accuſed, they ſhould deliuer thē vp to the Church, to iudge of the errors, or ſimple hereſie, in caſe it proceeded rather of ignorance, error, &amp; humaine frailtie, lightnes &amp; britlenes of the tonge of the accuſed, then of meere malice or will to cut himſelfe off from the vnion of the Church: and in caſe together with hereſie were found any publike ſcandall popular commotion, ſedition, or other crime importing any publike offence &amp; conſequently in caſe priueledged, then to be tyred by the Royal Iudges, &amp; of the Church together. And after the common fault ſhal be iudged by the Church thē the caſe priueledged ſhalbe iudged by the Royal, charging that any appeale made frō the ſentence ſhold be brought into Parliament. And for that the Iudge Eccleſiaſtical had not the ſeaſure of mens perſons out of their Pretoire, for the aide wich the one Iuſtice ought vnto the other, it was now giuen by priueledge vnto him, &amp; as far as ſhould pleaſe him, that in this crime only he might cauſe, vnder his authoritie, by their ſeargeants, to be put in execution the decrees of ſuch areſt of bodies as ſhold be iudged by thē, without asking any permiſſion of any ſecular Iudges, for feare that in delaying, the accuſed might be aduertiſed therof, &amp; ſo eſcape, &amp; if the eccleſiaſtical iudge ſtood in need of any aide; it was enioyned to all officers Royal to execute the Eccleſiaſticall decrees, without taking any knowledge of the cauſe. And in caſe the accuſed, or any ſuch as it ſhould bee decreed againſt, ſhould abſent themſelues, it was ordained that the Iudge Royall, within three dayes ſhoulde proceede againſt them by ſeaſure of their goods, that the accuſed ſhould bee deliuered vp to the iudge of the Church, to bee proceeded againſt as aboue ſaide. Afterwardes vpon the engroſing of this Edict in Parliament at Paris the twentie nine of Nouember, the Court ordayned at the requeſt of the Proctor generall, that vppon the plight ſhoulde bee ſet downe at the charge, that the Iudge Eccleſiaſticall ſhal not condemne any man, for crime of hereſie, be he lay or Clarke, in any pecuniarie fine: &amp; further that when in crime of hereſie he ſhall haue giuen any iudgement, either of perpetuall priſon, or otherwiſe hee ſhall no more in the ende of the condemnation vſe theſe accuſtomed wordes, Salua miſericordia Domini: And that forbidding ſhoulde bee made as well of the one, as the other. And for that the Kinge perceiued how ſlowly enough they proceeded to the execution of this Edict, the greater parte of the Royall iudges not ſo forwarde in fauouring the Eccleſiaſticall as they deſired, to bee meete therewith hee was

councelled to ſend his commaundement to the Parliament of Paris from Fountainbleau the 9. of Februarie 1549. willing them to appoint commiſſioners out of their body, to make the inditements of ſuch as ſtoode euill affected to the faith, in caſe the Preſidiall, or otherwiſe the Royall Iudges ſhould bee negligent, who ſhould pay the expences of ſuch appointed deputies.
            
               Diet of Ausbourge.Hereupon the 27. of Iuly the Emperour began the day of Ausbourge, propoſing there to continue the Councell, to keep the laſt decree of Ausbourg, to puniſh the rebels, &amp; reſtore the iuriſdiction and goods of the Church. But Maurice declared by his Embaſſadors, as it were alone againſt all the reſt, that he could not avow the councel except all begun a freſh, and that the Diuines of the confeſſion of Ausbourg might bother hard, with power to decide the matters, that the Pope ſhould not ſit as chief, but ſubmit himſelfe to the Councell, that he ſhould abſolue all Biſhops of their oth made vnto him, to the end they might freely deliuer their minde. But it was not permitted that this declaration ſhould be regiſtred. In the meane time George D. of Megelbourg with a maine army waſted the coūtry of Magdebourg, againſt whom the inhabitants &amp; ſouldiers iſſued forth. But hauing in the hinder part of his army placed all the Marchants &amp; Villagers, for that the beſt were in the fore front, they defeated thē, tooke the Artillerie, Baggage, &amp; ſundry of the inhabitants. This done, as they intertained notwithſtanding Maurice in al duty, the Elector of Brandebourg, Albert his coſſen, Henry of Brunſuich, &amp; ſundry other addreſſed troupes the better to ſhut thē in. But ſalied forth vpon them conducted by certain Gentlemen, Captaines &amp; ſouldiers, who in diſpite of Brunſuich were retired thither, and carried themſelues ſo fortunately, as they tooke their George of Megelbourg author of all. After Maurice was declared chiefe of the army by the Emperor &amp; the eſtates, with intent to block thē in, ordaining one hundred thouſand crownes for the expences paſt, &amp; threeſcore thouſand for euery moneth to come. Vpon the diſpleaſure in the meane time which the Emperor cōceiued for that the decree of Ausbourg was not practiſed, the Proteſtants ſaid that they could not ſo ſoone roote out the Religion, which had ſo long time growne old in the harts of men &amp; the Catholiques laide the fault vpon the Prieſts, negligence of Magiſtrates, &amp; wickednes of the Lutheran miniſters, ſo as nothing could be reſolued of, but all referred to the Councell. Hereupon Pope Iuly aſſigned the Councel at Trent the firſt of May 1550 by his Bull which he ſent vnto the Emperour. Now as the Emperor departing out of his countrie to come to Ausbourg, had left the Landgraue at Malines, Maurice and Brandebourg made earneſt inſtance for his deliuerie: but it was anſwered that not onely hee, but alſo his children &amp; Councellors had ſo be haued themſelues, that hee might not as yeat be deliuered. The Garde likewiſe told him that he was to be carried into Spaine: which made him ſeeke aide of his children, to whom ſetting before their eyes the fidelitie wherewith they were tyed vnto him, hee gaue in charge, that they ſhould cite Maurice to appeare according to the tenor of his obligation, which they did, and cited their friends many times moſt inſtantly. But they now together, now apart, one while by meſſengers, an other while in perſon, ſhewed that it woulde neither turne to their profit nor their Father to run to worke ſo headily. And from time to time alleaged new reaſons, whereby they hoped that hee might bee deliuered without any daunger, they prayed them then to take patience, and demaunded reſpite. The Emperour who had alreadye ſollicited the Landgraue, by De La Lare, to deliuer vp into his handes the letters of Obligation, ſeeing himſelfe againe importuned for his deliuerance, ſent Lazarus Schuende to his Children and Councellors, commaunding them not onelye hence forward to take heede they preſſed no more Maurice and Brandebourge, but alſo to ſende vnto him all the letters and renounce

any more the following therof. If they fayled therin, he threatned thē that they ſhold well abide the burthen of it. And yet for all that he preuailed not, hee declared in like ſort al ſuch Princes as were bound quit, &amp; abſolued of their promiſes: The Landgraue then ſeing not any hope left, determined to make an eſcape if it were poſſible for him; vpon which he ſundry times conſulted with his people which he cauſed to come frō Heſſe: But fearing the danger, they were very ſlack, in the end he made Conrad Bredeſten, &amp; Iohn Romelia, vndertake the matter, who from his owne countrie as far as Malines layd poſt horſes, vpon which he might eſcape. But the matter came out by one of his owne ſeruants, who in great friendſhip had told one at Malines,The Landgraue diſcouered minding to haue made an eſcape. that within a few howers he ſhold be at liberty, for being come frō hand to hand to the captaine of the Gards eares, euen vpō the pinch that he was ready to take his heeles, the matter burſt out and two of his ſeruants ſlaine in the place, the reſt taken and beheaded, and him ſelfe clapped into a more cloſe priſon. Whereof the Emperour being aduertiſed, hee tooke it maruelouſly at the hart, &amp; wrote to Maurice &amp; Brandebourg that this ſo audatious an enterpriſe turned to his diſhonor, being reſolued rigorouſly to puniſh thoſe which had either Councel or aſſiſted him therin. They ſent the Copie of theſe letters to Guilleaume du Lantgraue, telling him among other matters, that if he wold any more attempt the like, they would in nought be boūd vnto him: Maurice notwithſtanding conforted him apart, promiſing for the deliuerance of their father not only al his ſubſtance, but alſo to aduenture his own life, aſſuring him that at ſuch time as commoditie ſhould preſent it ſelfe, he would repreſent himſelf in Iuſtice, when as matters ſhold be ſo ſetled as they ſhould haue very ſmall cauſe to care for the miſlike of any. Which made many to ſurmiſe that at that time he practiſed ſome league with the French.
            
               Maximilian of Auſtria ſonne in law to the Emperor,Difference about ſucceſsion in the empire. &amp; choſen in his abſence K. of Bohemia came at this time frō out of Spaine to Ausbourg, called thither by Ferdinand his father, for the different which he had with his brother the Emperor, as touching the ſucceſſion of the empire. For the deciding whereof the Emperour had cauſed his ſiſter Mary to returne thither, who was parted from him in the month of September: for knowing how materiall the annexing of Germany was vnto himſelfe, he deſired ther to enſure &amp; eſtabliſh the ſeate of his ſonne, who ought to rule ouer ſo ſundry, and ſeperate prouinces. Ferdinand who tended to the ſame end, was as well reſolued, not to fruſtrate the attempt or profite thereof, were it either for himſelfe, or his children. Now Maximilian was of ſo milde a nature, &amp; vnderſtoode ſo many tongues, &amp; ſingularlie the Germaine, endued beſides with ſuch a curteſie in his manner of life, that he was not onely agreeable vnto all the people, but his vertues procured vnto him ſuch good hap, and aduancement, as I ſhall in place hereafter declare vnto you.
            For the better aſſiſtance of this councel whether the Emperor had giuen aſſurance to the Proteſtants to come in ſafetie, they choſe theſe diuines, Melancthon for Sax,Councell. 
               Bucer for Witemberg, vnited in opinion, &amp; approued by thē of Strasbourg: and after agreed vpon ſuch points as were to be ther propoſed, for all this Maurice to gaine time, ſpie his opportunity, and inforce the Emperor to deliuer &amp; ſet at liberty his father in law, trayning the ſiege of Magdebourg in length, wrote backe vnto him, that for his part he ſtoode very well contented, with that faith which he had giuen vnto him,Maurice demaundeth a more ſafeconduct. &amp; could require very litle more. But for ſo much as he was informed, that there ſtood in force a decree made by the councel of Conſtance, by which it was ordained that informatiō ſhold be made againſt al heretiques or any ſuſpected of hereſie, if perchance any ſommoned to a councell ſhold appeare ther, &amp; that ſentence ſhould be ther pronounced againſt thē, albeit that the Emperor ſhold giue thē his faith &amp; ſafe conduct, he deſired a ſufficienter aſſurance, for ſaith he this decree remaineth ingroſed, &amp; they

right well put it in practiſe,The Catholiques helde that faith was not to be holden with heretiques. in putting Iohn Hus to death. Who barely relying vpon the faith, &amp; ſafe cōduct which the Emperor Sigiſmond gaue him, went thither, the matter being thē thus, could not by any menes ſend any of his own people to Trent except the Prelates which were ther did in like ſort giue their faith, in the name of the whole Councell, as it was doone at the Councell of Baſle, which incontinently followed that of Conſtance, for the Bohemians hauing bene made wiſe by that which was before done, would by no meanes come to Baſle but vnder a ſafe conduct frō the whole Councell, he required then that by vertue of his authoritie &amp; credit, he would cauſe them to doe as much, otherwiſe if they did not giue ſafe conduct in like manner as had beene before giuen at Baſle, he proteſted, that it ought not to turne to any matter of conſequent, either to himſelfe, or any of like Religion, if they ſent no man thither I haue aboue ſpoken of Iohn Hus, of the Councell of Conſtance, &amp; of the war which the Bohemians made againſt the Church-men for ſuch cōdemnations. Now for that there was a decree made at Conſtance, that the firſt Councell ſhoulde bee held fiue yeares after, the other 7. and then from ten yeares, to ten yeares, the fathers aſſembled together againe at Baſle: and for ſo much as the Bohemians had not as then beene reconciled,Safe conduct from the coū
                  cell at Baſle for the Bohemians. purſuite was made againſt them by letters and meſſages, ſo as in the Cittie of Egre, there was a forme of ſafe conduct ſet downe in writing, the Bohemians ſaying that they would not make any difficultie at all to appeare at the Councell, prouided that the fathers would agree to that: after that they which had beene ſent in Embaſſage had made report, of that which they had doone, the fathers approued it and diſpatched away the like ſafe conduct ſealed, and by the moſt louing letters exhorted them to make themſelues ready, ſo as, when the ſafe conduct of the Emperour Sigiſmond ſhould be in like ſort ſent vnto them, they might preſently ſet forwards on their iournie. This was during the fower Seſſion, in the yeere of grace 1432. Maurice then being thereof aduertiſed by his people, ſollicited the Emperour, &amp; earneſtly inſiſted vpon the ordinance of Baſle, both as being the laſt, &amp; moſt conuenient for that time. For the caſe now of the Proteſtants, and then of the Bohemians was almoſt alike. And the Councell publiſhed at Trent for the like cauſes in effect, as it was at Baſle: to wit, to roote out hereſies, to reſtore the peace and tranquillitie of the common wealth, and for the amendement of the Church, all vices being vtterly ſecluded.
            The Emperour in the meane time, changed the eſtates of the Citties of Germanie alongeſt as he paſſed by, as at Ausbourg wher he altered the Senate, and reformed all at his pleaſure. Afterwards retired into Flanders, he ſent Henrie Haſe 1551. al along the Suaube appointing new Councellors, and depoſing all ſuch Preachers and miniſters as wold not obey the decree of Ausbourg. In the meane time Magdebourg was continually battered and rudely intreated, but after manye skirmiſhes reciprocall betweene the armie of Maurice, and thoſe which were beſieged in Magdebourge for one whole yeare together,Magdebourg deliuered vp. the 3. of Nouember 1551. Hedec being ſent from Maurice came to Magdebourg, where hauing cauſed the Captaines to come foorth into the next forte, he agreed of all things, and there paſſed letters ſigned and ſealed: Paſport was graunted to the men of warre to depart in ſafetie, but as ſoone as they were caſsirde, they were ſecretly entertained againe and enroled, vnder the charge of Megelbourg, who by accord had beene ſet at libertie; for Maurice to good purpoſe, would by no meanes haue his owne name come in queſtion. The cōditions of peace were theſe that they ſhoulde beſeech pardon of the Emperour, attempt nothing againſt the houſe of Auſtria and of Burgundie: ſubmit themſelues to the chamber; obey the laſt decree of Ausbourg; repreſent themſelues in iuſtice at the requeſt of any which would bring action againſt them; rayſe the fortifications of their Cittie at the

Emperors pleſure; receiue Garriſon at al times pay 150 thouſand crownes to the publike treaſor, deliuered to the emperor 12 great peeces of Artillerie towards the charges of his war and releaſe the Duke of Megelbourg, and all the reſt of the priſoners. The ſame very day that thoſe which had beene beſiedged went out, which were 2000 Pietons and 130 horſe, Maurice cauſed fiue enſignes of Fanterie to enter in, and the next morning himſelfe entred the Citie with his Cauallery. The Senate went out to meet him, to whome he cauſed an oath to be miniſtred to become true to the Emperour, th'empire and himſelfe, afterwards hauing left a ſufficient Garriſon, he cauſed al the reſt to voyd. That doone hee ſent for the preachers, and greatly complayned by his Councellors Facius, Calebric, and Mortiſe, of the iniurie which they had doone vnto him, in little Bookes, and Pictures imprinted by them, as if he had beene one reuolted from the Doctrine of the Goſpell, &amp; had made war againſt the Citie for their cōſtant profeſsion of the truth. Wherefore he ſaid, he had iuſt cauſe to be reuenged of them if he would follow his owne affections, but he quitted all to the cōmon wealth. Requiring from thence forward that they ſhoulde exhort the people to amendment of life, &amp; to beare reuerence to the Magiſtrate, he cōmanded alſo that they ſhould make publike praiers for the Emperour, for himſelfe, and for all other Magiſtrates. He ſaid further that the Councell was then held at Trent, to which he would preſent a confeſſion of the true doctrine, as well in his owne name as of al the reſt of the Princes &amp; eſtates, that they ſhold pray to God then to proſper the enterpriſe, &amp; take heede hereafter from proceeding in like iniuries as they had accuſtomed. The miniſters after hauing conſulted together anſwered, that it was not they themſelues which had publiſhed thoſe Pictures, &amp; yeat they could not eſteeme them worthy of any reprehenſiō, for that it was not to be denied, but ſince three yeares laſt paſt many of his Countrie were reuolted frō the pure doctrine; beſides that it was an eaſie matter to proue how the Cittie had beene beſieged for the Goſpels ſake, if they would onely regard but who were the firſt authors of the warre; that they had euer doone their dutie in admoniſhing of the people, which they would in like ſort doe euer after: as touching the Councell which was aſſembled to deface the truth, and in which the Pope was as cheefe, that was not lawfull for them to make any other praier vnto God, then that it would pleaſe him to breake in ſunder, bruſe, and ſcatter their deuiſes &amp; imaginations, for nought could they elſe attend from thence then all my miſchiefe. The Articles of compoſition were then publiſhed. But it is certaine that they were put in good aſſurance of their libertie &amp; Religion: Beſides that Maurice choſe rather, that the towne ſhold be yeelded to him then to the Emperor, as the iſſue afterwards declared. Now the end of the miſeries of Magdebourg, was the beginning of a war to thē, who had beene the authors of their afflictions as we wil tell you. In the meane while that Maurice remained in the towne, he ſufficiently open himſelfe, &amp; gaue out that it ſhold coſt him his life, but he would ſet his father in law at liberty: yea ſo far as the next morning he did not ſticke to tell it franckly to one which was talking with him. He had before ſent his Embaſſadors to the Emperor, for the deliuery of the Landgraue, hauing aſſociated vnto him the K. of Denmarke, &amp; ſundry Princes of Germanie as we will ſhew you, being reſolued to proceede therein by force, if he could not otherwiſe obtaine it beſides that he had already made a couenant with the K. of France,Embaſſage from the king of Fraunce to Maurice. who had ſecretly ſent thither Iohn de Ferſne B. of Bayonne. Who hauing a long time negotiated in Germany had good vnderſtanding of the tong. But it ſeemed, that the Emperour made very ſmall accounte of all theſe matters, and dreamed of nothing elſe then the warre of Parma, and Councell of Trent.
            
               Hereupon the children of the Landgraue wrote againe to the Emperour for the deliuerie of their father, whereof they would faine ſee an end. Who in the beginning of Nouember 1551. was gon as farre as Enipont, as well at the requeſt of the Prelats to fauour the holding of the Councell, as the better to prouide for the war of Perma betweene him and the King of Fraunce, to which he ſeemed ſo wedded as perſwading himſelfe that the King would not vndertake any other matter, he ſcarce beleeued the preparatiues of warre which were ſaid to bee made in Germanie. Then the Embaſſadors of theſe two Princes, being come in the beginning of December, after hauing moſt humblye ſaluted the Emperour in the name of their maſters, ſpoake in this ſorte.Maurice and Brandebourg Embaſſadors ſpeech. 
               
                  You know moſt mercifull Emperour, in what paine remaine at this day the moſt excellent Princes Electors Maurice and Brandebourge for the detaining in hold of the Landgraue, a matter happening vnto them beyond all expectation, ſuch time, as thorough a ſingular affection which they carried vnto you, by reaſon whereof they were deſirous to prepare vnto you the way to an eaſie and notable victorie, they ſought nought elſe then to eaſe you of a great charge by a long warre, and reſtore the Countrie to peace and tranquillitie. For which reſpect they haue ſo often bene ſuters vnto you, as wel in their proper perſon, as by their Embaſſadors, that it might pleaſe you to regard them, and releaſe the priſoner: your anſwere to their laſt Embaſſador was, that you could not doe it vntill you ſaw the iſſue of the day prefixed to bee held, beſides that you made no other promiſe, but that he ſhould not alwaies remaine captiue if he
                        •…
                      cpt the accord: But for ſo much as they being buſied about other affaires, haue not beene able at the ſame day to bee in perſon themſelues, they againe ſollicited you at Ausbourge, by their Councellors and reiterated letters. In anſwere whereof you wrote backe vnto them the reaſons of your conceiued diſpleaſure againſt him, pronouncing the Princes abſolued of their obligation towards the children of the Captiue. Wherefore they determyned to importune you in the like againe. And had come themſelues in perſon, had it not beene for what you know, they were both of them employed in the warre of Magdebourge, beſides that Brandebourg himſelfe was ſicke, which was the cauſe that they haue giuen vs in charge, to declare vnto you for the firſt point. That when you did ordaine that the Landgraue ſhould yeeld himſelfe vnto you vpon condition, they vnderſtoode your intention by the B. of Arras, which was, that he ſhould receiue, and keepe ſuch conditions, as you had propoſed and imparted vnto them. If it ſtoode a matter needfull to perſwade him to yeelde himſelfe in ſuch ſort, it was as needfull to declare vnto him that he ſhould not bee kept as a Captiue, nor worſe dealt with then the treatie of peace contained. The Princes then were his pledges, which your Councellers alſo well enough vnderſtoode. And where as the Landgraue ſtill inſiſted, that they ſhould declare vnto him ſome Articles of th'accord, and required that for the diſpatch thereof he might not be ſtayed aboue ſixe daies, it was graunted vnto him, after that the matter had beene propoſed to the B. of Arras. As touching the reſt of the points the Princes obtained therein more then they demaunded. And admit that in this proceeding matters ſhould not be a like vnderſtoode of the one ſide, and the other, &amp; that the Landgraue being come was impriſoned againſt the faith promiſed, yeat had the Princes neuer accuſed you for the ſame, had they not the ſame time, hauing bene graciouſly promiſed by your ſelfe, gon themſelues in perſon to Halle, &amp; ſet him thence, at ſuch time as the Landgraue approaching ſent vnto them to come vnto him to Numbourg. For at that time they ſpoake with you, ſignifiyng vnto you that they had perſwaded him to ſtand to the conditions propoſed, and that he was not far off, yea that if it pleaſed you they would goe and meete him: In the meane time praying you that ſince hee yeelded himſelfe vpon their faith and aſſurance, he might be charged no farther, to which you condiſcended. Now in the laſt diſpatch, there was no mention at all made either of priſon or detention, as your owne people the Biſhoppe of Arras and of Selde can verie well witneſſe. For the firſt had all the charge in this matter, and ſometimes called the other to aſsiſt him: for after that the

conditions were accepted of, and pardon demaunded, the Princes ſtood fully aſſured, that he ſhuld be incontinently releaſed; which they had reaſon to imagine for ſundry cauſes. Firſt, for that the Councellors neuer made once mention of retaining him, which was a principall point in the treatie which the Landgraue perceiued, and conſidered of aboue all. Moreouer, ſundry thinges are contained therein, which is not poſsible for any Prince captiue to accompliſhe, but for him onelye which is at libertie. After that he had beſought you pardon, you remitted his fault, and were contented to reuoke his baniſhment, and giue him letters of reconciliation, beſides that you receaued pledge and aſſurance, wherein it was ſet downe, that if he did not perfourme the accord, the people ſhould deliuer him vp vnto you, and the pledges ſhould by force of armes conſtraine him to do his dutie. All theſe things certes, had ſerued to nothing, and had beene meere ſuperfluous, if they had thought he ſhould haue endured corporall puniſhment: but they imagining nothing leſſe, conſidering eſpecially that the Councellors neuer made men
                        •
                     ion thereof, brought him vpon this aſſurance, promiſing to deliuer him backe againe before his children, and to endure like puniſhment that he ſhould doe, if any outrage were offred him. Such was their intention, which was ſince more confirmed, when after great requeſt the Duke of Alua inuited them to Supper at his houſe with the Landgraue. It was not poſsible for them to conſter in ſo ill a ſence, this ſummons and hoſpitalitye (conſidering the cuſtome and faſhion of the Princes of Germany) that he ſhould goe into the D. of Alua his houſe, as into a priſon: and that they ſhould goe with him ſide by ſide, and beare him company thither, which had they neuer ſo little made doubt of, who can imagine what they would haue done? for conſidering how they are Princes of Germany, and alſo Electors, iſſued from right honourable familyes, neuer would they haue bene a meanes that a Prince of an excellent houſe, both their allie and freend, ſhould haue bene brought to ſuch a banquet to fall into ſo great troubles, and that they ſhould leade him as captiue, and they were no whit at all made priuie to the fact, vntill after ſupper when the D. of Alua tolde him, that hee muſt remaine in the Caſtle as in priſon: howſoeuer the matter was, they went to worke with a good meaning, as we ſayde in the beginning; and for ſo much as they haue plighted their faith, you may well perceiue how hard and greeuous a matter it will be both to them and their children, if after hauing bene often put in minde of their promiſes, and after caution giuen, the Landgraue he detayned priſoner: you perceiue likewiſe (moſt puiſſant Emperour) you, who deriue your race from the Germaines, (conſidering that the Children of the Captiue Prince purſue their right, &amp; preſſe thē to redeliuer him vnto them, according to the condition of the bond) what becommeth them to doe according to the ancient cuſtome of the Nobilitie of Germany, for to preſerue their honour and good reputation, and how they ſhould be inexcuſable towards all the reſt of the Princes, when the power of citing ſhould be taken from them, or the inſtrument of the bond, in ſuch forme as remaineth in their handes, that if perchaunce the Landgraue who neither is priſoner by faith giuen, nor by compoſition, but by occaſion before ſpecified, through the griefe and impatience of his ſo long reſtrainte, haue ſought ſome meanes to eſcape, and that his men haue attempted ought againſt the Guardes, the Princes beſeech that it may turne no waies to their damage: but for that by reſon of the obligation they are in ſo extreme diſtres, out of which you alone after the immortall God, are able to deliuer them, and that you are moſt certaine how they ſtand enwrapped in theſe inconueniences; beſides that you ſtand fully aſſured of their good affection, loyalty, and ſeruice, for that in your aduerſities they neither haue ſpared their goods, nor bloud for your profit, according to the example of their anceſtors, they beſeech you as much as is poſsible, that you will ſuccour them in deliuering of the priſoner, and that therein you weigh not ſo much the fact of the Landgraue, as their perſons who holde you in ſingular reuerence, conſidering cheefelye that many of their families haue neither ſpared goods or liues for your anceſtors, and for the houſe of Auſtria and of Burgundie: and if perchaunce you feare that when he ſhall be at libertie, he will breake the accorde, you doe very well when the matter ſhall proceede ſo farre, but the Nobilitye

and people of Heſse ſhall promiſe the contrary vnto you by oath, and as the Princes haue made themſelues pledges, ſo if you deſire any further aſſurance they haue often offred it, and do at this preſent, hauing giuen power vnto vs to doe as much with you: as touching ſuch conditions as they haue bene able to accompliſh, they doe not thinke that ought is lefte remaining; and when you ſhall know the cauſe for which their fortes haue not beene ſo ſoone raiſed, they make no doubt but that you will eaſily excuſe and purge the children of the captiue: if there reſt any other thing they will in euery reſpect employ themſelues to content you. Therefore if they, their Fathers or Grandfathers, haue euer done ſeruice to your ſelfe, to the Emperour Maximilian, or any your anceſtors, or if you think that in time to come they may pleaſure you in any occaſion, they beſeech you affectionately that you ſuffer them to taſte ſome fruite thereof, and that you will cauſe them to ſee ſome effect of the hope and promiſe, which you gaue them firſt at Halle, ſecondly at Numbourg, and thirdly at Ausbourg: to the end in time to come they may haue the greater courage to honour you, being able to glory in that the fidelity and ſeruice which they haue done vnto you, hath bene by you acknowledged according to their deſerte, if they be refuſed, you may well thinke (excellent Emperour) what inconueniences will enſue, when they ſhall be enforced to appeare and approue their innocencye: but they hope well that you will regarde their praiers, which they will receiue for a ſingular benefite; and as well they, as the Landgraue with his children and alliance, ſhall for euer endure all paine to acknowledge it. And forſomuch as this matter toucheth ſo neerely their honour, they haue ſolicited the reſt of the Princes to entreate with them, whoſe Embaſſadours you ſee heere preſent, to the end that what themſelues haue not bene able to obtaine at your hands vntill this preſent, either by praiers, meſſages, or letters, theſe here may obtaine by their credit and fauour, beſeeching you to take it in this parte.
               
            
            After that they had thus ſpoken, they preſented vnto him the letters of Ferdinand K. of Romanes, of Albert D. of Bauieres, of the Bretheren of Lunebourg written in the behalfe of the Landgraue: thoſe Princes which made requeſt by their Embaſſadours, were the Elector Frederic Palatine, Wolfang de deux pontz, Iohn Marqueſſe of Brandebourg, Henry, and Iohn, Albert D. of Megelbourg, Erneſt Marqueſſe of Bade, and Chriſtophre D. of Witemberg, whoſe Deputies after hauing ſhewed their commiſſion ſpake in this manner.
            
               The Princes Embaſſadors.
               
                  The Electors Maurice and Brandebourg finding themſelues greatly troubled for the impriſonment of the Landgraue, and being minded to make requeſt vnto you for him (moſt mercifull Emperour) haue required our Princes to ioyne with them in this their requeſt, to the end it might be of greater weight and efficacie on their behalfe, which they could not deny vnto them, in regarde of that dutie of alliance, freendſhip, and coniunction which is betweene them. Conſidering then that the matter ſtandeth on ſuch tearmes, as the Embaſſadours haue at length fully declared, and that if the captiue be reſtrained any long time, it may turne to the damage and blame of thoſe which haue pauned their faith, the Princes which haue ſent vs hither doe beſeech you, and carefully warne you to weigh all theſe things, for they holde themſelues greatlye intereſſed if the honour, dignitie, and renowne of them be not countergarded: a matter likelye to enſue, if the Landgraue be not releaſed. They require then moſt humblye that theſe their requeſts may ſomewhat preuaile with you, eſpecially conſidering that hee hath already acknowledged his fault, and beſought pardon on both his knees: that it is now a long time he hath lien by it, and aboue all, in regarde that the extreame neceſsitie of the two Electors demaundeth it, who are fallen into this inconuenience, for their proceeding herein in good faith, and their willingnes to doe you ſeruice, that if peraduenture there may haue bene ſome fault committed, or that ſome matters haue not bene ſo well vnderſtoode, yet it is a matter honeſt and proper to your mercy, to prefer equitie before the rigour of law, and not ſo much to regarde him which is captiue, as the ineuitable neceſsitie of the Electors, and to deale gently and liberally with them, according

to the example of your anceſtors, who haue alwaies bene carefull to preſerue the honour of the Princes of the Empire: that will turne to your great honour towards all men, and them eſpecially. And it will breed courage in them, to remaine vnto you ſingularly, faithfull frends, and affectionate ſeruants, and to employ themſelues in all thinges for the loue of you.
                The King of Denmarke in like ſorte had ſent his owne Embaſſadour, who made the like requeſt.
            The Emperour made anſwere certaine daies after, that the matter was of importance, and required ripe deliberation, and for ſo much as he was aduertiſed that Maurice purpoſed to make his repaire very ſhortlye vnto him for other matters of conſequence, in ſorte as hauing written vnto him he attended him dayly, hee would defer it vntill his comming, hoping that the matter might then be entreated of moſt commodiouſly in his preſence, for their partes they might returne again to their Princes, and tell them as from him, that he would well carry in remembrance their demandes, and ſo guide himſelfe in this action, that they ſhould well vnderſtand that their recommendation caried great weight towards him.
            Thus Maurice not able to picke any certainty out of all this, and cauſing himſelfe in the preſence of many to be importuned by the Landgraues children, who threatned to put both him and Brandebourg in ſute for breach of promiſe, had no ſooner reſolued with the Embaſſadour of Fraunce, (whoſe charge euery man was almoſt ignonorant of) of what ſuccour he was to draw thence, then he determined to make open warre againſt the Emperour, but for all that, the better to couer the fainednes of his intents, he ſent his deputies to Trent, to demaund ſuch another ſafeconduct as the Bohemians had at Conſtance, that the Pope ſhould ſubmit himſelfe vnto the Councell, and acquite the B. of their oathes,Maurices demaunds at the councell. that all Nations might haue free acceſſe thither, and that whatſoeuer had beene decreede before the comming of the diuines ſhould be cancelled. Srasbourg and the D. of Witemberg his Embaſſadors ſaide as much. This comming of the Embaſſadours, and the promiſe which he made ſhortly after to be with the Emperour, tooke away all ſuſpition of warre, for the very Emperour wrote to the Archbiſhops of Mayence, Treues, and Cologne, to leaue Trent, and to goe home and defend their Countries from ſuch ſouldiers as had bene retayned after the ſiege of Magdebourg: and as the Emperour had in like ſort prayed them to do, they receiued very curteouſly: Maurice his deputies giuing vnto thē their ſafeconduct, ſaying that they had ſummoned thither all Nations, that all were free there, but that reaſon and their dutie would by no meanes permit them to diſanull or cancell ought, and much leſſe to ſubmit the Pope to the councell. The Embaſſadours after hauing examined their ſafeconduct, found it different from that of the Bohemians, and after that they had haſtely read it ouer, they found the principal articles changed, and the reſt cleane omitted: for in the ſafeconduct which was giuen out to the Bohemians, there was among other thinges, that they ſhould haue power to decide, that in all differents they ſhold take for iudge the holy ſcripture, the practiſe of the ancient Church, ſuch councels and interpreters as agreed with the holy Scripture, that it ſhould be lawfull for them to ſay diuine ſeruice in their houſes, in a tongue which they vnderſtoode, that nothing ſhould be proffered in contempt and blame of their doctrine, the firſt, third, and laſt of theſe points were cleane omitted, the ſecond which is the principall, was altogether altered: this being conſidered of according to the forme of the decree of Baſle, they preſcribed another ſafeconduct, and anſwered that it was not lawfull for them to exceed their commiſſion, which carried that they were not to take any ſafeconduct, but according to the contents of that at Baſle. The Proteſtant

deputies for the cauſes before ſaide would departe,Diuerſities of opinions in the Councell of Trent. and alſo for that they were not able to endure the iniurious preachings of certaine Monkes againſt them &amp; their religion, of which likewiſe they had not free exerciſe in their owne houſes: beſides the brute of the warre which haſtened then as well as the reſt of the Germanes and Italians, who on the other ſide ſuſpected that the Prelates of Spaine, Scicilie, Naples, and other Imperialls, which demaunded the continuance of the Councell, would require a reformation in the Popes authoritie, (whoſe Court they eſteemed alreadye ſtretched to farre) and in the diſcipline and manners of the Church, that the ſuperfluitie, ambition, and example of their euill life, might be taken away, that euery man ſhould take charge ouer his Church, and holde but one benefice, to which ſundrye Germane catholickes put to their helping handes, albeit otherwiſe they did not acknowledge any errour in the doctrine, and yet were of opinion that Councels might erre. In ſumme both they and the Italians (who they ſay neuer greatly loued to heare of Councels) fearing that they would enter into this conſideration, truſſed vp their bagge and baggage, as ſoon as they had newes of the taking of Ausbourg, which Maurice and his company took the fourth day of Aprill, three daies after the ſiege, from the Emperours Garriſon. And albeit that the day of the Seſſion was ordained to be the firſt of May, yet altogither in diſpaire, the Fathers which remained, aſſembled together the 20. of Aprill,The Councell of Trent deferred for 2. yeares. Creſcence Cardinall, Legat and preſident for the Pope, died of an apprehenſion. and proroged the councell for two yeares, by reaſon of the diſcorde happened betweene the Kings and Princes, and for longer to, if in the mean time they could not be reconciled. But the Legate Creſcence Preſident of the Councell, remained in his bed, frighted with a ſpirit which hee ſawe by night, whereupon ſhortly after he fell ſicke, imagining that he could neuer eſcape it, any comforte that his freendes or familiars could yeelde vnto him: ſo he died at Veronne. The Pope in the mean time had accorded with the K. of Fraunce, who prepared himſelfe againſt the Emperour, as I will tell you.
            You haue ſeene the ſiege of Magdebourg, and what Maurice did for the deliuerye of the Landgraue, who perceiuing the Emperour, fed him with nothing but hopes, practiſed as many Princes, Captaines, and other, as he was able in Germany, to maintaine the libertie of Religion, and the common wealth. After that hee made an allyance with the K. of Fraunce, and gaue hoſtages on the one ſide and the other: and thē they cauſed the occaſions of the warre to be imprinted and ſpred abroad, to draw the more vnto them. In the mean ſeaſon th'emperour cauſed the Drum to be ſtrooke vp at the foot of the Mountains, and aſſembled his men of war at the towne of Rutte, as the moſt commodious Rende-uous for all his troupes.
            
               The birth of H. 3. K. of France and Pologne.Vpon the 21. of September 1551. Queene Catherine of Medices was brought a bed at Fontaine-bleau, of a Sonne, named Edward Alexander D. of Angouleſme, by the deputie of Edward K. of England, and of Antoine of Bourbon, D. of Vendoſme, with the Ducheſſe of Mantua, who ſince notwithſtanding left thoſe names, to take that of his Fathers, ſo as he ſhalbe euer hereafter named Henry the third, K. of Fraunce and of Pologne.
            
               The Baronnie of Montmotency erected into a Duchie, with right of a Petre.Much about the ſame time, the K. curious to acknowledge from wel to better, the good and agreeable ſeruices done vnto him by Ane de Montmorency his Conſtable, erected his Barronie of Montmorency into a Duchie, together with the right and prerogatiue of a Peere.
            If the French liued in peace, the Germanes ſmallye caring for their reſt, prepared themſelues not onely to a ciuill and dangerous warre, but alſo deſired to bring in among them, the Prince of the Flower de Lys, for a counterpeaſe to the Emperour

               Charles, whom they ſought to enforce, for the deliuery of the Saxon and Landgraue, which he helde priſoners, as alſo to reſtore Germanye to her former eſtate. To this end they had already made him to vnderſtand, together with their complaintes, what meanes they had to conſtraine him thereunto, if he would but releeue them with his ſuccor. To which the K. of Fraunce being councelled to liſten &amp; yeeld all fauour, for naturall and ancient deſire to abate the greatnes of ſuch an enemye, before that hee would put his forces into the fielde, (to which hee gaue the Rende-uous at Vitry in Partois, hauing already ſent the Gouernours into their Prouinces, to leuye the beſt trained, and moſt voluntary Souldiers that they coulde) hee cauſed to be publiſhed throughout his owne Realme, Italye, high and lowe Germanye, and other quarters, the declaration of his will and true purpoſe touching thoſe ſuccours, which hee was minded to yeelde vnto them. The letter which he cauſed to be made,The K. letter to the Electors. to this effect at Fontaine-bleau, the 3. of February 1552. which Du Freſne broght with him into Germany for the ſame end, were of this tenor. That the greatnes of an eſtate Royall, fetching his encreaſe from the enterpriſes which redounded to the profit of many, and aboue all to the freendes of a Crowne, he in like ſorte was euer ſtudied from his infancy in this holy exerciſe, and in a deſire to ſhew himſelfe gratious, and ſuccourable to the whole worlde, and that therefore comming to be King, he had likewiſe vndertaken the protection of the Queene and Realme of Scotland, renued the ancient alliance with the Suizers, and in the end concluded peace with his Brother the King of England, that the Emperour had leſie no craft or wilines, whereby he might breake this peace, to the end that Fraunce might be enwrapped with warre and diſcordes, albeit that hitherto himſelfe was neuer willing to haue begun the broile, or to arme againſt him, ſtanding onely to his own defence. But hauing heard the particular complaintes and greefes of ſundry Princes, Lords, and States of Germanye, as touching the tirannie and violence which the Emperour vſed ouer them, vnder colour of reuniting thoſe whome the diuerſitie of religion had ſeparated and diſioyned, of reforming of abuſes, and ouerrunning the Turke, a common enemye to Chriſtendome. And ſeeing that herein he went about nothing elſe thē to encroche vpon the Monarchie, and make it ſucceſsiue to the houſe of Auſtria: for theſe conſiderations the K. remembring that he was deſcended from the bloud of the ancient Franks or Francons, iſſued out of Germany, and the perpetuall alliance and amitie, which in all time had bene betweene the Gallique nation and the Germane, the which the Emperour and his Grandfather euer went about to breake, he could doe no leſſe then haue regarde thereunto, and prouide for ſuch miſchiefes as are offred themſelues on that part, as the Emperor ſhuld execute his plats and enterpriſes. His moſt chriſtian Maieſtie, fearing leaſh the alteration of the Germane libertie might proue the ruine of that Nation, and by conſequence a great ſhaking to the glorye and power of the Gaules, which haue Germany for their rampire, hath conſidered it to be a matter almoſt neceſſarie for all Chriſtendomes preſeruation, that they ſhould ioyne their forces together, to came whatſoeuer he were, any one that ſhould preſume to encroche ought vpon their liberties: it imported further, that his Maieſtie had ſeene ſo great diſorder among the Princes and States of th' empire, that hee was not able to iudge whether all, or parte of them, had praied him to ſhewe himſelfe a protectour and defendor of this Germane liberty almoſt ſhaken in peeces: that at this time many Princes as well Electors as other, had beſought him to aſsiſt them, and be their helpe in this ſo vrgent a neceſsitie. And in caſe that he would not doe it, he proteſted before God and men, the miſchiefe that was likely to befall them, and of which his Maieſtie onely ſhould

be the cauſe, greatly iniurying his own reputation, and doing wrong to that which he oweth to the ancient league betweene Gaule and Germany. Beſides that he ſhewed to thoſe Princes, Electors, and others, and to the free Citties, that ſince that Charles and his brother had taken vpon them to commaund the Empire, euery thing fell into confuſion and diſorder. And that that was true, a man might ſee with his eye, how he had fleeced the Empire, the Citties, comminalties, and other places, as Gueldres, Vtrech, Cambray, and Conſtance, which he had made become proper to the Houſe of Auſtria: and that by a thouſand deuices he went about to encroche vpon the Archbiſhop of Treues, and the Dukes of Cleues and Witemberg, and cleane to ruine the principalitie of Heſs. The King further complained how that Charles and Ferdinand had cleane excluded the Embaſſadours of Fraunce, from the Dietts and generall aſſemblies of Germany, where in times paſt they had their place: and that contrary to the liberties of Germany, he would bridle the liberty of the Souldiers, and keep them from ſeruing any in the warres but himſelfe: and that it was not lawfull for them to come vnder his pay, without incurring of condemnation, as breakers of his Edicts, and attainted of treaſon: he blamed the Emperour of Fellonye and crueltye, in cauſing many braue warriers to be cruelly put to death, becauſe they had receiued pay of the K. of Fraunce, he made inſtance of the Colonell Vgesberg, whome the Emperour cauſed to be beheadded in his own preſence, of the baniſhmentes and confiſcations decreede againſt Captaine Recrod, the Ryngraue, Riffiberg, and Schertelin, againſt whom he ſhewed himſelfe ſo obſtinately and cruelly carried, that hee cauſed to be proclaymed by ſound of Trumpet, 4000. Crownes to whoſoeuer could bring aliue or dead any of theſe Lords, to make a good paſtime with the effuſion of Germane bloud, for the Spaniſh bandes. This diſcourſe and other matters finiſhed, he concluded that he had made an alliance with ſundrye of the Princes of Germanye, and that togither with them hee was reſolued to imploye both his forces and his perſon, for defence of the libertye of whole Germanye: without expecting any other recompence, then the honour, in hauing doone his dutye, and tyed vnto him ſo puiſſant a nation as the Germane, of which this his deſire and pretence, hee gaue aſſurance vppon his oath, taking God to witneſſe, and ſwearing that in the woorde of a King, and faith of a Prince: and that in generall hauing no other intention, then to deliuer all the eſtates of Germanye from the oppreſſion of the Emperour, and of his: in particular, hee pretended to doe it in fauour of his moſt deare and moſt beloued Coſins, Iohn Duke of Saxe, and Philip Landgraue of Heſs, detained in miſerable ſeruitude by Charles, whatſoeuer hee had promiſed or ſworne to the contrarye, thereby to get immortal praiſe as ſomtimes did Flaminius, for hauing affranchiſed Greece. And towards the latter end of the letter were theſe wordes: We promiſe you in likſorte by the almightie God, before all the Kings, Princes, and Potentates of Chriſtendome, that we will not in any ſorte ſuffer, that either to you in generall, or to any one in particular, of what eſtate or condition ſouer he be, to our knowledge any wrong or iniurie ſhalbe offred. And leſſe will we endure, who carry the title of moſt Chriſtian, that any damage ſhalbe done to the goods and perſons of you, moſt reuerende Prelates, Abbots, and other of the Clergy, as it hath bene wrongfullye giuen out by our aduerſaries: rather we determine to receaue you into our protection and ſafegarde, prouided that you declare your ſelues for vs and our allies: and giue vs ſufficient aſſurance of your intents, hoping for the reunion of the Church, which we attende by the recouering of the publique libertie: to which we will imploy (God willing) all our power, the which we were willing to let you to vnderſtand, moſt reuerend Prelates,

and moſt excellent Princes, and other the eſtates of the holy Empire, to the end you ſhould not be ignorant of the true occaſion of this warre: by which we pretend to purſue the Emperour with fire and ſword, and (albeit very loath) to cut him of as a rotten member from the body of the common wealth, or at the leaſt to enforce him to ceaſe offring you any more iniurie. As touching ought which more particularly may touch vs, or the affaires of the holy Empire, you ſhall know it by our beloued and feal councellor and Embaſſadour Iohn du Freſne B. of Bayonne, whome to this end we haue diſpatched, praying you to giue credence vnto him, in whatſoeuer he ſhall deliuer on our parte, and that by him you will aduertiſe vs of your intention. Yeouen at Fountaine-bleau the 3. of February 1552. and in the 5. yeare of our raigne. By this ſo autenticall a promiſe &amp; ſolemne league, the K. made him ſelfe defendor of the Germanes, and was called Father of the countrye, and protector of the Germane nation &amp; holy Empire: and was ſo proclaimed throghout al the imperiall cities, with inſcription &amp; triumphant arcks &amp; ſhewes, recōmending this his curteſie, that of gallantnes of minde, he would at ſo great charge oppoſe himſelf, to ſo happy &amp; puiſſant a Monarch. On the top of this writing printed in the vulgare tongue, there was a hat betweene two daggers, and written about liberty: vnderneath was the K. repreſented, who called himſelfe Protector of Germany, and of the Princes in Captiuitie.
            Wheras he ſaid that the Emperor had ordained a price to ſuch as could kil certain of his Colonels, it was thus. Charles 5. reuiuing his Edicts, had againe baniſhed out of th'empire the Colonels Ringraue, Recrod, Ritteberg, and Schertelin, all in the Kings wages, ſo far as to promiſe 4000. crownes, to whomſoeuer would bring any of them vnto him aliue or dead: for they puſhed hard at the wheele, and after the league was concluded whereof we haue ſpoken, carried ſouldiars into Fraunce.
            In the meane ſeaſon Maurice hauing lefte his Brother Auguſtus behinde him as his Liuetenant in his Countrie, marched into the fielde, and with the Landgraues ſonne, who tooke with him Du Freſne the K. Embaſſadour, ioyned together the forces of th' aſſociates at Tonouert. Afterwards Albert of Brandebourg came vnto them with a great number of foot &amp; horſe, at Koburg, they brought all as they paſſed alongſt vnder their ſubiection, and infringing whatſoeuer had bene ordained by th'emperour, they eſtabliſhed there new officers, and a new kinde of gouernement, conſtraining al to furniſh them with mony; albeit the Emperor, and eſpecially his brother Ferdinand beſought thē of peace, for which they promiſed their beſt endeuor, notwithſtanding that the emperor cauſed the drum to be ſtroke vp at the foot of the moūtains, for the aſſembling of his army: an occaſion that Maurice wēt to Lincy in Auſtria, to know of Ferdinand the conditions of peace, for he was willing to pacifie matters at the wil of th'emperor, who on the other ſide had exhorted by his letters the principall Princes of Germany that they would beſtow ſome paines in quenching this vprore, &amp; aduiſe of ſome means of peace, to which his beſt endeuor ſhuld not be wanting: and wheras ſome demanded ſuccor of him, not ſeeing thēſelues ſtrong enough againſt ſo great a force, he aſſured them of a good hope, anſwering that now they were in tearmes of making peace, which as he hoped ſhuld take good effect: if otherwiſe, he would ſuccour thē with his means &amp; the whole cōmon wealth of Germany: Vlme was beſieged 6. daies, &amp; the 19. of April the Princes went to Stoach, a town of Hegouia where in the name of the K. of France 3. months pay was giuen thē, according to the accord,Hoſtages of Fraunce and Germany. and there was giuen for hoſtage on the French part, Iames of the houſe of Marche, for the other (to wit the Earle of Nantueil) died on the way. The hoſtages which the Princes gaue vnto the King, were Chriſtophle Duke of Megelbourg, and Philip ſonne

to the Landgraue. The laſt of April the Princes returned to the Danube, ſome leagues belowe Vlme. In the meane ſpace Albert of Brandebourg ſet fire on all the Townes and villages of Vlme, and got as much monie as hee was able, afterwardes hee tooke the forte of Helfeſten, ſcituated vpon an high mountaine, and there put garriſon: that done, he rated the towne of Giſling, which is three leagues from Vlme, with certain other villages about, at 18. thouſand crownes. In the meane while Maurice arriued at Lincy, propoſed certaine articles touching the deliuery of his father in law, for the appeaſing of the difference in religion and doctrine, of well and dulye eſtabliſhing the common wealth,The propoſitions of Maurice. of making peace with the K. of Fraunce their companion and alye, of receiuing into grace the baniſhed men, as the Ringraue &amp; the other abouenamed, among which was likewiſe Hedec, who ſome yeares before had placed himſelfe in the ſeruice of Maurice: but the Emperour had not ſet downe any certaine price to him that could take him, were it for feare of offending Maurice, or any other occaſion. Vppon that Ferdinande (who had with him his ſonne Maximilian, his ſonne in law Albert of Bauieres, and the Emperours Embaſſadors) made anſwere to his demaundes, that the Emperour made no refuſal to deliuer the Landgraue, prouided that they laid aſide their armes, for regarde of religion and the common wealth, it pleaſed him well that they ſhould aduiſe therof in the firſt aſſembly, but it was a matter too noiſome to the Emperor to comprehend therin the K. of Fraunce, and yet that Maurice might do wel to know of the K. vnder what cōditions he would appoint it: as for the baniſhed perſons, they night reenter into grace, ſo as they obſerued ſuch conditions as the Emperour would ſet downe. Further Ferdinande demaunded of Maurice aide againſt the Turke in Hungarie,The reſolution of peace deſerred, and wherefore. after that the peace ſhould be concluded, and that he would not ſuffer any ſouldiers to retire towards the K. of Fraunce. To which Maurice anſwered that it was not lawfull for him to conclude of anything, without the conſent of his companions, ſo as they departed vpon condition that the 26. of May they ſhuld meet againe at Paſſau, which is betweene Ratisbone and Lincy, at the reencounter of Danube and Eno, whether the Princes who had the handling of the matter, ſhould repaire, if not, their deputies furniſhed with ample power: where we will leaue thē preparing of peace, and the French of warre, for the maintenance of the Germane libertie, as I will ſhew you by and by, to the end to run as far as into Prouence, where notable accidents preſent themſelues, worthy of the poſterity.
            I will not paſſe any further without informing you of a moſt notable occurrence which happened in this time amōg the Prouencials, I haue before told you of the Albigeoiſe religion,The Vaudois of Prouence how, when, by whom, and wherefore perſecuted as Heretiques. and how by force the Albigeoiſe quitting of Fraunce, went to inhabit in diuers cuntries of chriſtendom, eſpecially among the mountains of Sauoy, Piemont &amp; Prouence, where continuing the exerciſe of their religion, they were named Vaudois. Now for that in all times they neuer acknowledged the ſupremacye of the Pope, from whoſe doctrine theirs differed in many points, cheefelye after the comming of Martin Luther, and publiſhing of his writings, which they couragiouſly embraced, as neerer approching to their ancient doctrine, they were oftentimes accuſed and purſued, as Heretickes and Rebels to the Magiſtrate, ſo as with the zeale of the Cleargie, encreaſing the perſecution vpon all Lutheranes, in the yeare 1540. at the inſtance of the Kings Proctor in the Parlament of Aix in Prouence, the inhabitantes of Merindol, were adiourned in the perſon of certaine named in the arreſt (which wee will recite) to appeare perſonally, according to which adiournement, the within named came to Aix to preſent themſelues to the Court. At the daye aſſigned vnto them, they addreſſed themſelues to the skilfulleſt Aduocates, to aske

their aduiſe how they were to guide and gouerne themſelues in this affaire. The Aduocates and Proctors tolde them, that it was not lawfull for them to giue councel vnto any that were ſuſpected of the Lutherane ſect. Notwithſtanding one ſecretly and aparte aduertiſed them, that they were not to preſent themſelues to the ſaide Court, except they were ready, and prepared to endure to be burned, yea at little fire, without any forme or figure of triall: for that had already beene concluded of among them. With theſe ſpeeches the Merindoliens were greatly aſtonied, and more afterwards when indeed they ſaw ſundry of their ſect to be cruelly murthered, hauing no other cauſe alleadged for their condemnation, but that they had ſpoken and maintained ſuch matters, as had bene declared Lutherane, by the cenſures &amp; determinations of the Doctors in Diuinitye, which they of Merindal perceiuing, retired themſelues without euer appearing at the aſſignation, ſo as defaulte was pronounced againſt them, by vertue whereof the Court ordained an Arreſt, which euer after was called the Arreſt of Merindol, the tenor whereof was in this wiſe. At the demaund the profit and vtility of defaultes obtained by the Kings Proctor Generall,Arreſt of the parlament of Aix. demaunder in caſe of crime of diuine and humane treaſon, againſt Andrew Menard, and adiourned to three peremptory dayes, not appearing, but making defaulte, the charges and informations conſidered, made at the requeſt of the K. Proctor generall,They were about 24. as well inhabitants of Merin, dolas, other their neighbours. the ordinances of arreſt of bodies, and for defaulte thereof the adiournementes of peremptorye dayes, being decerned againſt the ſaid accuſed, and making defaulte the 30. of Iuly 1540. the ſaid adiournements of 3. peremptory daies being paſſed, the defaults obtained by the ſaide Proctor generall, againſt the ſaid accuſed, the K. letters patents of the laſt of May in the ſaid yeare 1540. addreſſed to the ſaid Court, to proceed againſt the Vaudois and Lutheranes, and other holding contrary ſects, and derogating from the Chriſtian faith and religion: and alſo other letters pattents of the ſaid Lord, of the 16. of Iuly 1535. and of the laſt of May 1536. by which he graunted pardon and grace, to ſuch as were charged, accuſed, and ſuſpected of hereticall errors, ſo as they would renounce the ſaid errours, and abiure them within ſix moneths, after the publication of the ſaid letters, the certificat of the witneſſes, hauing bene wel examined in the aboue ſaid informations, other charges, informations, &amp; proces, being brought forth by the ſaid Proctor generall, to make it appeare how moſt notoriouſly all they of Merindol hold Vaudoiſe &amp; Lutherane ſects, reproued, and contrary to the holy faith &amp; chriſtian religion, withdrawing &amp; concealing many ſtrangers &amp; fugitiues charged to be of the ſame ſect, nouriſhing and fauoring of them, how in the ſame place ther is a ſchoole of errors and falſe doctrines of the ſaid ſects, which dogmatiſe their ſaid errors and falſe doctrines, &amp; bookbinders, which imprint and ſell books ful of ſuch falſe doctrine: and alſo that they of Merindol vnder the ground, and in rocks, haue made caues wherein they retire &amp; hide thēſelues, their complices &amp; goods, and make themſelues ſtrong: other information being takē by the iudge of Apt, to make it more manifeſt, how after that Colin Palleng named of the plane of Apt, as a ſectator of the ſaide ſects, was ſome daies paſſed condemned &amp; burned, and his goods confiſcate to the K. in deſpite hereof many of the ſaid people of Merindol, their complices &amp; adherents in great aſſemblies of ſix or ſeuen ſcore men armed with harquebuſes, halbeards, ſwords, and other weapons, brake into the Mill of the ſaide Colin Palleng and Thomas Palleng brethren, beat and outraged the Miller, and threatned him and as many as ſhould intermeddle with any goods of any their ſecte. All this conſidered, it was ſaide that the Court hath ſaid and declared, doth ſay and declare, the ſaid defaultes to haue bene wel obtayned, and for the profit of them, that all the aboueſaide accuſed, and adiourned are true

defaulters, and ſtubborne, barred of all defence, attainte, and conuinced of the caſes, and crimes laide vnto them: hauing detained, maintained, and followed hareticall ſects and doctrines, reproued, and contrary to the faith and Chriſtian religion, and to the holy prohibitions of the King: and being the retirers and receiuers, the releeuers and fauourers of men charged, and diffamed to holde like damnable doctrines, &amp; reproued ſectes, for remedy whereof, it hath condemned, &amp; doth condemne the aboue named: and in caſe that they cannot be taken and apprehended, from henceforward it hath baniſhed them al, and doth baniſh them out of the Realme, landes &amp; ſignories of the K. with interdiction and prohibition, not once to enter therein vpon paine of the gallowes, and declareth all and euery the goods of the aboueſaid condemned, and baniſhed, their wiues, children &amp; families, acquited and confiſcate to the ſaide L. and alſo prohibiteth all Gentlemen, vaſſales, and other ſubiects of the ſaid Lord, that they receaue not, nor conceale any of the ſaid condemned, their wiues, children, ſeruants, or families, nor giue them any fauour, aide or comforte, in any manner whatſoeuer, vpon paine to ſuch as ſhall doe the contrary of confiſcation of their goods, and other arbitrary paines. And moreouer conſidering that all the ſaid place of Merindol, is the notorious retreate, den, refuge, and forte of people holding ſuch damnable and reproued ſects, the ſaid court hath ordained &amp; doth ordaine, that al the houſes builded in the ſame place ſhalbe pulled down, razed, and laied euen with the ground, and the ſaid place be lefte vnhabitable, ſo that none ſhall reedifie or builde there, without the pleaſure and permiſsion of the K. likewiſe that the Caſtle, and den, ram partes &amp; forts, being in the rockes and woods of the land of the ſaid Merindol ſhalbe ruined, and laid in ſuch ſorte, as none ſhall be able to make there any more reſidence, and that the places ſhalbe vncouered, and the woods where ſuch fortes are cut downe, and grubbed 200. paces about: and further it prohibiteth and forbiddeth, that no parte of the inheritance of the ſaide place ſhalbe let to farme, rente, or otherwiſe, to any of the ſirname or lyne of the aboue condemned. Publiſhed in iudgement at the Parlament of Prouence ſitting at Aix the 18. of Nouember 1540.
            
               Particular iudgements vpon the merite of the arreſt.Afterwards the court ordained to euery iudge ordinary, of Aix, Tomes, S. Maximia and Apt, the execution of what might concerne him in the Arreſt, which many found very ſtrāge, as a thing done too headily againſt perſons, which neuer were once heard or come to their anſwere, yea ſo cruelly againſt the feminine ſexe, and yong infants, and the execution made againſt all of a whole country, albeit the proceedinges, had only bene againſt certain perticular men therin mentioned. Others holding with the arreſt ſaid, that in caſe of Lutherane ſect, iudges were not bound to obſerue either common or ordinary law, ſo as it tended to the rooting out of thoſe, which are ſuſpected to be ſuch.The preſident La Chaſſane differreth the execution of the arreſt, and his reaſons. And to ſet forward the execution, the Archbiſhop of Arle, the B. of Aix and others, met oftentimes, ſolliciting the Preſident La Chaſsane, and other, to the ſame effect: ſo farre as to aſſure them to furniſhe their charges, and to turne vppon them any the Kings indignation or other mens, who ſaide he might very well be angry at ſuch a deſtruction of his ſubiectes: and that it was rather made to holde in awe the Lutheranes, being ſo great a number of them in Prouence, then to execute it according to the Tenor: and moreouer that it was not definitiue, and that the lawes and ordinances of the Realme doe not permit the execution before other procedings, yet they preuailed ſo far as he cōdeſcended vnto thē, and ſtroke vp the drum to aſſemble the people of Prouence which were commaunded to march, which they did:Cauſe of delay of the execution. but they were as ſoon countermanded &amp; diſcharged by the liuely propoſitions among other of a very learned gentleman named D. Alence, how that this proceeding

by way of acte and force, was againſt all forme and order of iuſtice, and without diſtinction of the culpable, and innocente. Now it was ſo as this Preſident had put in light and publiſhed in print, a booke intituled Catalogus gloriae Mundi,
               Catalogus gloriae mundi, made by Chaſsane, and printed at Lions. in which by way of paſtime he ſet downe the proceedings which he fained had ſometimes bene helde againſt the Rats, by the officers of the ſpirituall Courte of the B. of Authun, as if it were, that through all the Bailliwick of Lauſſois, there had beene ſuch a quantitye and great multitude of Rats, that they deſtroied and eate the corne of all the Country, whereupon it was thought good that ſome body ſhould be ſent to th'officiall of Authun, to excommunicate theſe Rats, and that thereupon the Official hauing heard the plaintife of the Proctor fyſcall, ordained before that he would proceede to excommunication, that a warning ſhould bee giuen by order of iuſtice, wherby the Rats ſhould be cited at 3. peremtorye dayes, and for default of apparance then to proceede, &amp;c. The three daies being paſſed, the Proctor preſented himſelfe againſt the Rats, and for fault of apparance obtained default: by vertue whereof he demaunded that they would proceede to excommunication: wherupon it was iudicially concluded, that the Rats ſhould bee prouided of an Aduocate to heare their defence, &amp;c. conſidering it was a queſtion of their totall rooting out and deſtruction. This Gentleman ſeruing his turne herewith, ſaide to the Preſident. Sir, remember the councell which you wrote in a matter of nothing, when as being the K. Aduocate at Authun, you defended the Rats, and declared that the time giuen vnto them to appeare in was to ſhorte, and moreouer how there was ſo many Cats in the villages, as the Rats had ſome reaſon to abſent thēſelues, &amp;c. with many other rightes &amp; paſſages alleadged by you, and amply handled in your book made at pleaſure. Now ſo it is Sir, as by ſuch a pleading of a matter of vaine importance, you haue gotten the brute to haue rightlye ſet downe the manner whereby iudges ought to proceede in criminall matters: now will you not learne right by your owne booke, which wil euen manifeſtly condemne you, if you proceed any further to the deſtruction of theſe pore people of Merindol? is it not as conuenient that they ſhould haue as much law and equity as you wil giue to Rats? Through theſe perſwaſions the Preſident was ſo much moued, that incontinently he reuoked the commiſſion which was giuen, and cauſed the men of war to retire who was come within one league &amp; a halfe of Merindol, whereof they of Merindol rendred thanks to God, comforting one another, and animating thēſelues for euer to retain the feare of God, and ſubmit thēſelues to his prouidence. The brute of this enterpriſe, and execution of the ſaid arreſt together with the patience &amp; conſtancy of them of Merindol, grew ſo great, and eſteemed of ſuch importance, that it was not hid to K. Francis, who ſent letters to Langeay, who at that time was his lieutenant in the country of Piemont, to make diligēt enquiry of the truth of the whole matter:Guillaume du Bellay. L. of Langeay, lieuetenant for the K. in Piemont. whereupon he ſent into Prouence two perſonages, to whom he gaue charge to bring him the coppie of the Arreſt, and to enquire of all that which followed, and likewiſe of the life &amp; manners of them of Merindol, and the reſt which were perſecuted in the country of Prouence, which they did, and counted vnto him the iniuſtice, pilferies, &amp; villanies which as wel the eccleſiaſtical as ſecular iudges dayly vſed againſt thē of Merindol &amp; other. And as touching the life &amp; māners of the ſaid perſecuted perſons, they made report that the greateſt part of the inhabitants of the country of Prouence, affirmed that thoſe which were perſecuted were people of great trauaile, &amp; that ſince 200. yeares they retired out of the country of Piemont, to dwell in Prouence, and had taken to ſee farme many hamlets deſtroied by the wars, and other deſolate places: beſides ſo great labourers they were, &amp; ſo good husbands, that in the places where they

inhabited was great abundance of corne, wine, oyle, hony, almonds, and great cattell, ſo as the whole country about was releeued thereby, yea that before they came to inhabite in the ſaid countrie, Merindol was vſed to be let for foure crownes by yeare, and now it amounteth to aboue 350. crownes yearely rent to the Lord: and that it was euen ſo in Lormarin, and ſundry other places of Prouence, which dad beene deſarts and laide open to theeues, vntill ſuch time as they came thither to inhabite. They found likewiſe by information made in Prouence, that the Merindols &amp; other of the perſecuted, were a peaceable people, beloued of all their neighbours, of faire conditions, keeping their promiſes, and paying wel their debts, without ſute or brabling, charitable, not ſuffring any to be in need, of great almes to ſtrangers, and other poore paſſengers according to their power. The Prouenaeals affirmed likewiſe, that they of Merindol, and the reſt might very well be diſcerned from all other of the country of Prouence, for that they could neuer be brought ſo much as to name the Deuill, or any waies to ſwear, if it were not in iudgement, or paſſing of ſome contract. A man might likewiſe know them for that if they were in any companye where laſciuious ſpeeche were vſed, or blaſphemy againſt the honor of God, they would incontinently depart out of the ſame: we know not any other matter againſt them, ſauing (ſaid they of Prouence) that when they go to the market or about the towne, they are ſo ſeldom ſeene go into the Minſter, and if they do chance to goe in, they ſay their praiers without regarding of either he or ſhe Saint, and that in the high way as they paſſe by croſſes and images, they vſe no reuerence. The Prieſtes being likewiſe hard as touching the ſame, ſaid that they did not cauſe any Maſſe to be ſaide, nor Libera me, nor De Profundis, and that they neuer took any holy-water, and if any were giuen them at their houſes, that they would neuer ſay grandmercie to him that brought it, and they perceiued very well that they conned him ſmall thanks, that they neuer went on pilgrimage to gaine pardons, that they neuer made the ſigne of the croſſe when it thundred, but only looked vp into heauen ſighing, and prayed without croſſing themſelues, or vſing any holy-water, that they were neuer ſeene make any offring, either for the liuing or for the dead. In ſumme, Langeay following his charge, aduertiſed K. Frauncis of the whole, who hauing fully vnderſtoode it, ſent letters of grace, not onely for ſuch as were condemned vpon default and cōtumacy, but alſo for all other within the country of Prouence, who were either accuſed or ſuſpected for the like caſe, commanding expreſſely the parliament, that from thence forward they ſhuld not in ſuch a caſe proceed ſo rigorouſly as they had done for the paſt.

                           FRancis by the grace of God King of Fraunce, Earle of Prouence, Forcalquier, and countries adioyning,
                        to our welbeloued and feal, the people holding our Court of Parliament in the ſaide Countrie of Prouence, ſitting at Aix: health and loue.
                     
                     As we hauing vnderſtood, how ſome ſwarued from the right way of faith and Chriſtian Religion, whome they call Vaudois, aſſemble themſelues in certaine places of our ſaide Country of Prouence, where they continue in their errours, through the ſeducing of ſome euill ſpirites, whereto it were neceſſary to yeeld good and wholeſome prouiſion, to the ende this venome may not proceede any further: we make you to know, how we enclining rather to mercye and clemencye, then to the rigour of iuſtice, and willing to aſſaye rather by way of curteſie and perſwaſion, to retire and redreſſe the ſaide wandred perſons from the way of ſaluation, then by rigorous puniſhmentes to make them fall into diſpaire: conſidering eſpecially the great multitude of them, which they ſay are fallen into theſe faults and errours, and that we may hope that through the bounty of God our creator, they wil rather reduce themſelues to the way of ſaluation, thē to be out of the congregation of God, &amp; faithfull chriſtians, and remain continually in the feare of the rigorous iuſtice as well of God as man.

We for theſe conſiderations haue giuen &amp; do giue by theſe preſents grace, pardon and remiſsion as much as in vs lyeth; to the ſaid Vaudois. And haue acquited thē, &amp; do acquit them of al paines &amp; offences, and of al puniſhments and condemnation, which might touch them either in perſon, or goods, by vertue of any iudgement giuen, or to be giuen. Prouided neuertheleſſe, that within three moneths after notiſe of theſe preſents duly made vnto them, they returne to God our creator, and make ſuch an abiuration, and ſolemne recantation, as is requiſite for all the errors, and falſe doctrines, into which they haue heretofore fallen: from whence they ſhall entirely depart, and promiſe to liue Catholiquely and faithfully, as it is requiſite &amp; neceſſarie for all good Chriſtians, liuing according to the law of God, and the Church. And to this ende, and for to vnderſtand, if they will accept of this our preſent grace and mercy, we will that they ſhall come or ſend vnto vs, ſuch a number of perſons as ſhall bee thought fit and ordained by you, in full ſuertie as well to come, remaine, as returne, without that during the ſaid time any diſturbance or hinderance be offred vnto them, in their perſons, goods, or manner whatſoeuer. And in caſe they ſhall not accept hereof, but remaine in their obſtinacy, you ſhall make ſuch puniſhment thereof, as you ſhall thinke the caſe deſerueth: and for the better accompliſhing hereof, we haue giuen &amp; doe giue full power, authoritie, commiſsion, and commandement by theſe preſents. By which wee will, and command all our iuſtices, officers and ſubiects, bee they of warre, or otherwiſe, that to you, your commiſsioners and deputies, they lend, &amp; giue all aide, fauour and aſsiſtance, when &amp; as often as by you and your deputies it ſhall be required.
                     
                        Yeouen at Fountaine-bleau the eight of February. The yere of grace 1540. and of our Raigne 24.
                        
                     
                  
                
Thus ſigned, by the K. Earle of Prouince, Bayard. Theſe letters went for a time ſuppreſſed, but in the ende they were ſignified to certaine priſonners, who were detayned in the priſons of Aix, of whome it was demaunded, if they would take the benefit of thoſe letters, which ſhould bee commnicated vnto them, euerie one paying one crowne of the ſum for the Coppie. By this meanes the priſonners were enlarged in paying their expences, and promyſing to appeare at the Courte, when and as often as they ſhould be demaunded.
            Afterwards hauing obtained that they might appeare in Parliament by Proctor, they tooke out a Copie of the proceedings againſt them, which before thay had not; at the requeſt of the Kings Councell, which purſued them, they ſent a confeſsion of their faith, to Cardinall Sadolet Biſhoppe of Carpentras, and other,Confeſſion of the Vaudois faith. and after to King Francis the firſt, taught vnto them (ſaid they) euer ſince 1200. yeares after the comming of Chriſt: as their auncients and aunceſtors witneſſed vnto them. The which his ordinarie reader Caſtellanus read vnto him, containing the Articles of God the father creator of all thinges: of the ſonne aduocate and interceſſor for mankinde: of the holy Ghoſt, comforter and teacher of the truth of the Church, which they ſaide to bee aſſembled of all the choſen, hauing Ieſus Chriſt for head: Of miniſters: Of the Magiſtrate, whome they confeſſed ordayned of God, to puniſh malefactors, and defend the good, to whom it ſufficeth not onely to carrie honour, but alſo to pay taxes and Impoſts, without acception of ſtate whatſoeuer: &amp; that at the example of Chriſt who did likewiſe practiſe it: Of Baptiſme, which they maintained to be a viſible, and exteriour ſigne, repreſenting vnto vs the regeneration of the ſpirite, and mortification of the members: Of the Lordes Supper, which they holde for a thankeſgiuing and commemoration of the benefite receiued by Chriſt: Of marriage, which they ſaide was not forbidden to any, by how much it was holy, and ordained of God: Of good workes, wherein they ought to employe themſelues continually: Of mans traditions, which they ought to ſhunne: proteſting, in ſome that the rule of their faith, was the olde and new Teſtament: and that they belieued al, which was contained in the Apoſtles Creede. In concluſion they beſought the King to giue credit to their

ſaying, offering themſelues to proue it falſe, if ought elſe had beene otherwiſe reported againſt them, whenſoeuer it ſhoulde pleaſe him to giue them audience. In the meane time the Biſhoppe of Aix, and of Cauaillon, purſued the execution of the arreſt; ſo as it was ordered by the Court of Parliament of Prouence, that according to the Kings letters pattents, maſter Iohn Durandy, a Councellor of the Court with a ſecretarie, and the Biſhop of Cauaillon, with a doctor in Diuinitie, ſhould goe to the place, and perſwade the inhabitants of Merindol, and cauſe them to abiure thoſe errors, which moſt plainely they ſhould make appeare vnto them, and in caſe, that conuicted by the word of God to haue followed and lyued in errors, and hereſies, they would not make recantation, that then of all that had beene doone, Verball proces ſhould be made, to proceede againſt them as the Court ſhould thinke good. But as the Church-men were in hand with them to make them recant their doctrine, they refuſed, offering to proue it, by the word and truth thereof, and offering to renounce if they could be proued heretiques thereby. They were queſtioned with, and aunſwered ſimply: ſo as by little the perſecution, not the hatred ceaſed againſt them, eſpecially vpon the ſuddaine death of Caſſane, the Preſident, of Iohn De Roma Monke a ſeuere inquiſitor, who woulde fill Bootes with hot ſcalding greaſe, and after make them to pull them on. Of which and ſuch like behauiors, Francis the ſecond being aduertiſed, gaue commaundement by his letters pattents to the Parliament, that hee ſhold be arreſted, &amp; his proces made. But hauing warning therof he fled to Auignon, where being ryfled of his owne ſeruants, and from great wealth become a begger, he was tormented with ſo horrible griefes, that nothing could yeeld him any reſt. So as no man being able to endure the ſtincke of his vlcers, he deſired nought, but to dye, which he did. In the ende Iohn Minier, of Oppede, Preſident, neare to Merindol, and Cabriers, (the inhabitants whereof had at an other time made heade againſt him, and put him to his heeles) hauing giuen the King to vnderſtand, that as many of them being aſſembled as came to fiftene thouſand, they were gon in armes to take Marſeilles, and to Cantoniſe it, beſides that all the Countries round about were in great danger of being loſt, being all Lutherans, hee obtained letters, to enable him to execute the arreſt, by meanes of the Cardinall of Tournon, and other, ſo as he prepared himſelfe to the execution of the arreſt againſt Cabrieres, Merendol, and twentie two Villages. Whereof they being aduertiſed, repayred again to King Francis, in the yeare 1544. to whom they gaue to vnderſtand how from the yeare 1540. his Maieſty hauing perceiued the euident oppreſſion, and nullitie of the ſaide arreſt of contumacie, had cauſed the execution thereof to be differred, forbidding there ſhould be any more proceeding in ſuch rigour. And how notwithſtanding many had oppreſſed them, and ment to oppreſſe them more, and more, briefly they preſented vnto him the whole proceedings as aboue ſaid. An occaſion that he reuoked the execution of the arreſt of contumacie, and all ſuch proceedings as had beene before doone, and agreed by the Parliament as well from which, as from his Proctor generall, hee tooke away the Coniſance of the cauſe, vntill he might be informed by one of the maſters of requeſts of his houſe, and a D. in Diuinitie of the Vniuerſitie of Paris, whome hee had deputed to goe to thoſe places, to the end they might well and amply inquire of the life,The proceedings vſed in the proces of them of Merindol. faith, and conuerſation of thoſe of Merindol, and the reſt. This reuocation was publiſhed in Parliament, and inſinuated to the Proctor general in the end of October following. The Parliament at the inſtigation of Oppede, commaunded Philip Courtin Huſſer of the Parlament, to make great ſuite for the obtaining of the K. letters to execute the arreſt, and notwithſtanding the interdiction, the Articles and inſtructions

were made by the ſaid preſident, with a requeſt ſigned by the Proctor generall; yea the purſute was made for money, which had beene ordained by the Parliament, for the charges of the ſuite: Whereupon Courtin did ſo much by his diligence, and ſubtiltie, that thorough the fauour of the Cardinall of Tournon, he obtained letters in the moneth of Ianuary following, vnder the name of the K. Proctor generall, from the priuie councell, to put in execution the arreſt of contumacy, notwithſtanding the reuocation aboue mentioned.
            
               Iohn Minier cheefe Preſident, hauing receiued the letters ſent vnto him in Ianuary 1545. which he concealed vntill the 12. of Aprill, aſſembled the Court, and there recited the K. letters, by which it was commaunded that the arreſt ſhould be put in execution, ſo as certaine of the Parliament were appointed Deputies for the execution. Minier promiſed to aide them, for becauſe in the abſence of Grignan he was lefte his Liuetenant, in the gouernement of Prouence,The war lie exploit of Minier vpon the execution of arreſt. he had before at the K. commaundement leuied troupes of men of warre, to goe againſt the Engliſh, but he ſerued his turne with them againſt theſe. Moreouer he had ſent a commaundement to Marſeiles, Aix, and Arle, vnder great paines to all ſuch as caried armes, that they ſhould put themſelues in readines, and march at their firſt call: there came likewiſe ſuccours vnto him out of the Countye of Auignon, a poſſeſsion of the Churches. Their firſt courſe notwithſtanding was not againſt Merindol, but ouer the Countrye neere to the towne of Pertuis, ſo as the 15. of April Minier accompanied with a number of Gentlemen and Captaines, came to Cadenet, in the time that ſome of his companie ouerrunne two Villages neer vnto Durance, where practiſing a thouſand pillages and inſolences, they put all to the fire and ſworde, except a great number of Cattell which they carried away with them, there was no leſſe done in other places. They of Merindol ſeeing all on a fire round about them, preſented a ſupplication to Minier, crauing onely liberty to depart in their ſhirts with their wiues and children into Germany, but hauing for anſwere that he would ſend them all to inhabite in hell among the deuils, they abandoned their houſes, and fled into the woods, paſſing that night neere the Village of S. Falaiſe in great fright. The inhabitants of the Village were already determined to flie: likewiſe the B. of Cauaillon vice-legate of Auignon, had giuen charge to ſome Colonell to make a ſhort diſpatche of the worlde, ſo as the next morning they got ſomewhat further into the wood, for there was euery where danger throughout: and Minier had forbidden vpon paine of death, that no ſoule ſhould helpe them, but that they ſhould be all alike ſacked whereſoeuer they were found. The like forbidding was made in all places round about, bordering vpon the Popes territorie: beſides that the Biſhops defraied a great parte of th'army: The poor paiſants then marched on through a monſtrous vile way, carrying their little children vpon their ſhoulders, in their armes, or in cradles, yea ſome of their wiues following thē great with child. Being arriued at the place apointed, they found many who had ſaued thēſelues there, after hauing loſt all: but ſoon enough newes was broght them, how Minier had gathered together all his men of warre to come and followe them: This was towards night, an occaſiō that after a whiles cōſultation, they took a ſodain and an haſtie deliberation, and for that they were to paſſe by hard and rude wayes, they left their wiues, daughters &amp; children, with ſome other, among which was one of their Miniſters: th'other went on to Muſsi, as they had agreede, hoping the enemy would take ſome pittie of ſuch a multitude, without weapon, and vnable to defend it ſelfe: Euery man may well geſſe what groanes and ſighes, what teares, what imbracings they made one with another at the parting, hauing trauailed ſore all night, and

in the end gained the toppe of the Mountaine of Lebron, they could diſcouer nothing but a number of villages and farmes all on fire. Minier hereupon deuided his troupes into two partes, and for that he had vnderſtanding by a ſpye which way they of Merindal were gone, he went to the village and ſent the reſt to followe them. Before that theſe men had entred the forreſt, a certaine Quidam of pittie being moued, ranne before, ſo as being at the brim of the Rocke, and hauing caſt two ſtones where he geſſed thoſe people reſted, cryed out to them that had repoſed themſelues, that they ſhould flye to ſaue their liues, albeit that he no waies perceiued them. At that inſtante two of thoſe that were gone to Muſsi, gaue them warning that their enemyes were comming, and then they made the Miniſter runne awaye, with the reſt which were left to garde the women, ſhewing to them a high way throughout the Forreſt, by which they might eſcape: hardly were they departed, but that the ſouldiers were come with faire naked ſwordes, and great howtes, crying that all ſhould paſſe by the point and edge of their ſwordes: notwithſtanding they put none to the ſworde. But after many inſolences, they led away the women bare both of victual and mony, hindred of doing worſe by a Capten of horſe, who by chāce paſſed by, and threatned that they ſhould dy if they did the contrary: but commaunded them with all ſpeed to repaire to Minier, ſo as the enterpriſe was cleane broken of: in ſorte that hauing left the women, which were aboue 500. they ruſhed on vpon the butyn, and cattell. Minier in the meane time came to Merindol, and finding it cleane voide of inhabitantes, pilled and burned it, after an horrible execution done of whatſoeuer was found therin, for hauing met with a yong lad, he made him be tied to an Oliue tree, and ſlaine with harquebuſe ſhot: from thence he went to the towne of Cabrieres, battred it with Canon, and by meanes of Captaine Poulin, perſwaded the inhabitants to open vnto him the gates, and yeeld themſelues, promiſing thē that they ſhould ſuſtain no iniury: but anon after that the Souldiers became maſters, euery one was cut in peeces, without regarde of age, ſexe, religion, alliance, neighbourhoode, or any other reſpect, ſome fled into the temple, other into caues of the caſtle, but they were all drawne thence, and ledde through a medowe, where being ſtripped bare, they paſſed all by the ſharp of the ſworde, not onely men, but women, and of them ſome great with childe: afterwards Minier made about 40. women to be encloſed into a barne full of hay &amp; ſtraw, where he ſet it a fire, and as ſome ſtroue to quench it with the winde of their gownes, and preuailed nought, other ran to the windowes of the barne, into which they were wont to pitch in the haye, with intent to haue leaped downe: but being driuen back from thence with blowes of Pikes and Clubs, they were all burnt the 21. of April. After that Minier ſent one parte of the armye againſt La Coſte, they ſo no ſooner were departed, then thoſe were found which were thruſt together in the caue of the Caſtle of Cabrieres, then all cryed out againſt thoſe that were ſhut in the caue, and calling back thoſe which were gone to La Coſte, they made likewiſe as ſtrange a ſhambles, without reſeruing any one: eight hundred were counted for dead, as well without as within: ſundry infantes which were ſaued were rebaptiſed, that done Minier ſent his troupes to La Coſte: the Lord whereof had already perſwaded the Citizens to carry all their armes into the Caſtle, and to raze the towne in foure places, promiſing vpon his credit with Minier, that no iniury ſhould be offred vnto them, he was beleeued and obeyed: but departed from thence to beſeech Minier, he was not farre vntill he found the army, which ſpared not to paſſe forward: at the firſt entrye they did nought to the towne, but the next morrow they gaue a more freſh aſſaulte, vpon a few that defended it, ſo as hauing ſet the fanebourges on fire, they tooke it at

their eaſe, becauſe that many that were fearefull ſlunke away, and ſlipped downe by ropes, abandoning their companies, and the place ordained for their defence. In ſumme, the towne being taken and pilled, with great murther of all ſuch as were met there, they runne all to a garden neere vnto the Caſtle, where without any regarde they enforced the wiues, and maides which were retired thither with a great fright: yea hauing ſhut thē in a whole day and a night, they intreated them ſo inhumanely, as ſuch as were with childe and the yong maides died preſentlye after. In the meane time they of Merindol and their companions, wandring through the woods and rockes, if they were taken, as ſoone ſlaine, or ſent to the Gallies, ſauing thoſe which died of famine. About 25. were hidden neere vnto the towne of Muſsi, within a caue, but being diſcloſed they were all as well ſtrangled as burned, There was not then any kinde of cruelty that was not practiſed, ſome but very few eſcaped the ſlaughter, who ſaued themſelues at Geneue, and places bordring vpon it. Now for that the K. before continued the perſecutions and burning paines againſt the Lutheranes.The princes of Germany write to the King of Fraunce in fauour of ſuch of his ſubiects as were perſecuted. In the moneth of May the Proteſtant Princes of Germany, beſought the K. by letters written from Ratisbone, for his ſubiects who were ſo reſearched &amp; purſued for the ſame faith which they helde. And for that ſome made their owne peace, redeeming their life, their goods, and eſtates, by abiuration of their faith, they beſought him that that condition might be taken away, declaring how dāgerous a thing it was ſo to wound and make ſeruile the conſciences of men. But the brute of ſo ſtrange an effuſion of bloud animated them the more, and offended many, which greatly abated the credit which the King had gotten throughout Germanye: no leſſe then in Zuizerland where the reformed ceaſed not as neereſt neighbors, to be mediators towards the K. that he would take pittie of th'eſcaped: but for a full anſwere, he ſent vnto thē word, that for iuſt cauſe he had commaunded that execution to be done, and that they had no more to doe with what he did in his owne country, or what puniſhment of iuſtice he made ouer his malefactors, then he had to intermeddle with their affairs. See now how the will and nature of men changing with the affaires and reportes: King Frauncis ordained a puniſhment for the Authors of this tragedie: how his ſonne Henry carryed himſelfe in the execution thereof, and all that which followed, to ſerue for moſt remarqueable occurrences, which may poſſible happen to any eſtate.
            That which moued Henry 2. King of Fraunce, to publiſhe his letters pattentes, in forme of adiournement, againſt thoſe of the Parlament of Prouence, who had ſhed the bloud of the inhabitants of Cabriere and Merindol, and other neighbours about, was that his Father King Francis at the point of death, touched with remorce and greefe, that he could not before he died make a puniſhment in example of ſuch, as vnder his name &amp; authority,This touch at the poynt of death, leaueth neither King not ſubiect vnſought, without any reſpect: an eſpeciall warning to all princes. had wrought ſo ſtrange cruelties againſt his ſubiectes of Prouence, charged his ſon with great obteſtations, not to defer the puniſhment, how otherwiſe God who leaueth no ſuch outrages and ſackings vnpuniſhed, would worke the reuenge, and ſo much the more (ſaith he) as this affaire toucheth our honour among all nations, it cannot be better repaired, then in making all them ſuffer, who in ſuch cruelty abuſed the dutie of their charge, without ſparing great or ſmall, weake or mightye: that by their example all men hereafter might take heede of any the like enterpriſes. This was the occaſion why King Henry decreede by his letters pattents as followeth.
            
               
                  
                  Letters pattents againſt the executioners of the arreſt in Prouence, vpon Cabrieres and Merindol.
                  
                  
                     
                        HEnry by the grace of God King of Fraunce,
                     to our firſt Huſsier greeting:
                  
                  Our Proctour in our great Councell, appointed by vs Proctour in cauſes after mentioned, hath cauſed to be deliuered and tolde vnto vs, how in the yeare 1540. the 18. day of Nouember, there was a certaine iudgement giuen in our Court of Prouence, which they would call and terme the arreſt of Merindol, by vertue of which 14. or 16. particular men therin named, inhabitantes of Merindol, ſtoode condemned for defaulte and contumacy, to be burned as heretiques and Vaudois: and in caſe they could not be apprehended, to be burned in picture, and their wiues, infants, and maidens, were defeated and abandoned: and in caſe they could not be taken, they were then pronounced baniſhed, and their goods confiſcate, a matter notoriouſly iniuſt, againſt al law &amp; reaſon. And albeit that the inhabitāts of the ſaid Merindol were neuer heard nor called to their anſwer, yet by the ſaid iudgemēt it was ſet down that al the houſes of the ſaid Merindol ſhould be thrown down, &amp; the town made vnhabitable. And in the yere 1544. the ſaid inhabitāts made their repair to the late K. of famous memory our father laſt deceaſed, whom God abſolue, &amp; others who were likewiſe helde for heretiques, declaring how againſt all truth they were tearmed Vaudois, and heretiques. They obtained letters of our ſaid late Lord and father, whome they had let to vnderſtand, how they were dayly troubled and moleſted by the Biſhops of the Countrie, and by the Preſidents and Councellors of our Parliament of Prouence, who had already ſued for their confiſcations and landes for their kinsfolkes, minding hereby to driue them cleane out of the Countrye: beſeeching our ſaide late Father, that he would ſearch out the truth. Whereupon it was ordained, that a Maiſter of Requeſts and a Doctor of Diuinity, ſhould goe downe to thoſe places, and throughly enquire of their manner of liuings and for that the ſaid Lord could not ſo readilye ſend thither, he ſhould in the meane time take into his owne hands, all ſuch ſutes as were depending by reaſon thereof: and forbid all cognoiſſance thereof to the people of our courte of Parliamēt of Prouence, the which euocation was ſignified to our ſaid court the 25. of October following: which ſtanding much diſcontented with the contents therof, ſent to the K. an Huſsier to purſue letters of reuocation, which were obtained the firſt of Ianuary after, by which vpon information made to the late Lord the King, how they had beene in armes, in great aſſemblie, forcing towns and Caſtles, pulling priſonners out of priſons, and rebellious to all iuſtice, keeping it in ſubiection, the ſaide late Lord permitted them to execute the Arreſtes giuen againſt them, reuoking the ſaide letters of euocation, in regarde of the relapſe hauing not abiured: And ordained that all ſuch as ſhould be found charged and culpable of hereſie, and the Vaudoiſe ſect, ſhould be extermined. And that to that end the Gouernour of the Countrie, or his Lieuetenant, ſhould therto imploy his forces, wherby iuſtice might be obeyed: which letters were not ſignified but kept vntill the 12. of Aprill following, which was the day of Quaſimodo, on which day after dinner, the firſt Preſident Maſter Iohn Minier, cauſed the ſaid Court to aſſemble, and cauſed our Proctour to preſent the ſaide letters, and require execution of the ſaide pretended Arreſt, of the 18. of Nouember 1540. of which no mention was made in the ſaid letters, but only in generall termes of arreſts giuen againſt the Vaudois: and hereupon it was ſet downe, that the ſaid pretended arreſt ſhould be executed according to the forme and tennor, making like errour as before. And that the ſaide Commisſioners already deputed, ſhould goe to the ſaide place of Merindol, and other places requiſite and neceſſary for the execution thereof, and that all thoſe that were of the ſaide ſect ſhould be extermined, and ſuch as were taken priſonners ſhould be led into the Gallyes for a priſon: there were appointed for the executioners, Maiſter Francis de la Fond, ſecond Preſident, Honore de Tributiis, and Bernard de Badet Councellors, with whome likewiſe, M. Iohn Minier Preſident, went as Lieuetenant to our ſaide late Father, to giue as hee ſayde a ſtrong hand onely to iuſtice, and to that ſhould be needefull thereunto: and carried with him▪
                     
men and artillerie, who neuer keeping the way to Merindol, went to Cadenet, in which place the ſaid Minier held a councel in the ſaid quality of liuetenant of our ſaid late father; and vpon that they ſaid it was reported vnto thē, how ther were a great nūber of the ſaid inhabitants in arms, who made a bulwark, without any further inquiry, they concluded to go aſſaile them to break the ſaid Bulwark, and kill them all if they reſiſted, and if they fled, that their houſes ſhuld be burned, diſtributing to the Captains ſundry villages to be burned, &amp; conſequently ranſackt, albeit there was no mention made at all thereof in the ſaid pretended arreſt, which they would ſeeme to execute, nor any of the ſaid inhabitants either in generall or particular, at any time called to their anſwere. Sundry villages were diſtributed to Captain Poulin, appertaining to the Lady of Cental, who had both aduertiſed him, and alſo the ſaid Minier; how her Senates were good labouring men, and good chriſtians, and not of the Vaudois ſect, praying them not to offer vnto thē any iniury, offring to make them ſubmit thēſelues, and obedient to iuſtice; wherof the ſaid Poulin aduertiſed the ſaid Minier, Preſident, and how hee had ſent vnto him a man of the long roabe to know what he ſhould do. Notwithſtanding without hauing any regarde at all to the ſaide aduertiſements, there were 22. townes burned &amp; pillaged, without any inquiſition or cognoiſance of cauſe of thoſe which were culpable or innocent, &amp; without any reſiſtance made of the inhabitants parte, or any bulwarke, and therwithall the goods of the ſaid inhabitants had bene pilled, and many women &amp; maidens forced, and other execrable crimes committed; that done, the ſaid pretended Commiſsioners went to Merindol, where they found onely one poore boy of 18. or 20. yeares of age, who had hid himſelfe, whome they cauſed to be tied to an oliue tree, and killed with harquebuſes ſhot; then pillaged the towne, and burned it, and that done they went to Cabrieres, where were ſlaine men, women, and maidens rauiſhed, euen within the Church: great number of men bound together, and carried into a Medow, and there cut in peeces, and ſundry other moſt execrable caſes committed, the ſaid Minier there aſsiſtant. About La Coſte were many men ſlaine; women &amp; maidens rauiſhed, to the number of 25. within one grange, and infinite pillages committed for the ſpace of more then 3. weekes: and the ſaid Minier imagining the better to be able to couer the ſaid cruelties and inhumanities, made a commiſsion narratiue, how he was aduertiſed that they had as well pillaged and ſacked the good as the bad Chriſtian and Vaudois, by which he cōmanded to be proclaimed by ſound of trumpet, a forbidding to pill any ſaue ſuch as leaue ſhould be giuen againſt, by our ſaid late Father, or himſelfe. Alſo he ſet forth another cōmiſsion in theſe termes; yee Captaines and Souldiers, who haue in charge to ruine and waſte the perſons &amp; goods of the Vaudois, touch not the tennants of the L. of Faulcon, who was his kinſeman, forbiddance was alſo made by ſound of trumpet, as well by the authoritie of the ſaid Minier, as of the ſayde de la Fond, not to giue either to eate or to drinke to any of the Vaudois, without knowing who they were, and that vpon paine of the Iibbet: by reaſon whereof many women, children, and olde people were found along the waies eating and feeding vpon graſſe like brute beaſts, and in the end dead for extremitie of hunger. After the ſaid cruelties and inhumanites thus committed and done, they ſent cōmiſsioners to informe who they were which were ſuſpected of hereſie, and made a number be caried to the Gallies, by forme of priſon, where a great parte ſince is dead: other their inditements being made, they enlarged quouſque, ſauing vnto our Proctor more amply to informe, and other they condemned in little fines, other they purely and ſimply abſolued, and chiefly the ſubiects of the Lady Cental, as appeareth by the iudgements produced: and yet all their houſes ſhould remain burned, and their goods pillaged: for this cauſe the ſaid firſt &amp; ſecond Preſidents, and the ſaid de Tributijs &amp; Badet councellors, ſeeing how euilly they had proceeded, and contrary to the tenor of the ſaid letters of our ſaid late Father, which required cognoiſance of the cauſe, ſeeing alſo how the people of our ſaid parlament of Prouence, had giuen iudgement contrary to al right &amp; reaſon, the better imagining to be able to couer their faultes, aſſembled together the 5. of May following, and vpon the ſpeech &amp; report of the ſaid Minier &amp; de la Fond,
                     
they gaue another iudgement vpon the pretended arreſt, that the execution begun ſhuld be perfected, and that to this end ſhould be ſent of the cōmiſsioners of our ſaid Court, into eche of the benches, to make their proces, and declare the confiscations of goods, and againe the 20. of the ſaid moneth &amp; yeare they againe aſſembled, &amp; gaue an other iudgemēt according to the precedents, containing ſundry heads ſtill thinking to couer their faults; and knowing that the complaint was come as far as to the eares of our ſaid late Father, they ſent the ſaide de la Fond towardes him, who vnder his information and proces verbal, obtained letters. yeouen at Arques the 18. of Auguſt 1545. approuing vnder hand the ſaid execution, neuer hauing let our ſaid late father to vnderſtand the truth of the fact, but ſuppoſed by thoſe letters, that al the inhabitants of ſuch towns as were burned, were condemned and adiudged for heretiques &amp; Vaudois: by which letters they were commanded to receaue to mercy all ſuch as would repent and abiure: and ſince we being aduertiſed of the truth of the fact, how, without any diſtinction between the culpable and the innocent, contrary to all forme &amp; order of iuſtice, and without any iudgment or condēnation before giuen againſt them, they proceeded by way of fact, and of force, whereupon thoſe caſes and crimes aboueſaid enſued, had appointed cōmiſsioners to informe, and that the criminall proces ſhould be made to the ſaid Minier, la Fond, de Tributijs &amp; Badet, in the proceeding to whoſe iudgements, our Proctor did require from the firſt day cōmiſsion to call the people of our court of parlament of Prouence, to come to anſwer by Proctor or Sindic, to ſuch concluſions as he purpoſed to take againſt them, for the iniquitie &amp; occular error of the ſaide iudgements, which were the cauſes of the ſaid crimes, cruelties &amp; iniquities, vpon which there hath not as yet beene done him any right: and ſeeing that they paſſed further in iudgement of proces, without therupon doing any right, doubting he would ſay that he was not the appellant, he preſented a requeſt to the Commiſsioners choſen by vs Iudges of the ſaide proces, to the end hee might be receaued appellant, of the execution of Merindol, and of that which enſued thereon. And for that to receaue our ſaide Proctor appellant of an approued execution, by an arreſt or iudgement of a courte of Parlament, depended onely of our authority, and the power and commiſsion of our ſaid commiſsioners ſtretched not ſo far, and for that it grew alſo a caſe wherein iudgement was to be giuen againſt one of the courts of our parlaments: we willed &amp; ordained that our court of parlament of Paris (which is the firſt and principall court of all our ſoueraigne courts) ſhould haue the proceeding and triall thereof: and to that end we made our letters pattents be diſpatched the 21. of Ianuary, but it was found, how the very day that the ſaid firſt appellations (which were of the ſaide concluſion to burne, made at Cadenet, of the execution done in the perſon of him which was ſhotte thorough with harquebuſies, of the forbiddance to giue no foode) were pleaded by our ſaide Proctor before our ſaid Commiſsioners, and that in pleading of the ſaid appellations, the ſaid Preſedents, Minier, de la Fond, de Tributijs &amp; Badet, coūcellors, ſtood principally to the points not to receiue, ſaying that they were the arreſts &amp; iudgments of our court of parlament of Prouence, &amp; that by the letters pattents of our ſaid late Father, the ſaid execution was allowed, ſo as he could not be receaued appellant, but that his requeſt and appellations were ioyned to the proces criminall, for that cauſe he preſented another requeſt, to be receaued appellant of the ſaid iudgments or pretē
                     ded arreſts, as giuen by ſuch as were no iudges, without euer hearing of the parties, vpon ſimple requeſts of the Proctors of our ſaid late father, without cognoiſance of the cauſe, and contayning vnrighteous errors, cruelties &amp; inhumanities, perſiſting to that, that according to our ſaid letters pattents, the ſaid appellations might be pleaded in the great Chamber of our Parlament of Paris, &amp;c. For this cauſe it is that we after hauing vnderſtoode the quality of the fact, which is in queſtion, the ſcandale which was and is not only throughout this Realme, but alſo ſtrange countries, and to the end that in like ſorte as ſo miſerable executions hauing bene done in the ſaid places, were publiquely done, ſo they may be publiquely repaired, if there be any faultes, and the trueth knowne not onelye to our Iudges, but alſo to all our Subiectes and Strangers, who may ſtand therein amiſſe conceaued, as well as for the dutie of iuſtice, and preſeruation of the

memory of our ſaide late L. and Father, haue by theſe preſents, of our certaine knowledge, full of puiſſance and royall authoritie, euoked, and doe euoke to our parſon, the inſtance of the requeſt made by our ſaid Proctor of the Queenes Chamber, preſented before the Iudges of the ſaid chamber, and the appellations formed by him, of the executions done in the ſaid place of Merindol, and other Villages, vpon which the parties haue already bene heard before the ſaide Iudges, appointed to councell, and ioyned to principall proces, to be anew pleaded, as the ſaide requeſts and appellations being inſeparable, with the requeſt and appellations a new caſt in by our Proctor, with the requeſt likewiſe preſented, tending to the end to be receiued, to carry himſelfe for appellant of the pretended iudgements and executions of the ſaide letters pattentes aboue ſpecified, and all the whole we haue by theſe ſaid preſents ſent back, and do ſend back into our Court of Parlament of Paris, in the ſaide great Chamber of pleading, on the 20. day of May next comming, there for to be publiquely and with doore wide open pleaded, and the parties being heard, to ordaine theron what ſhall ſeeme fit by reaſon.
                  So we command and ordaine by theſe preſents that the people of our Parlament of Prouence, together the ſaide Minier, De la Fond, Badet and Tributijs, and others to whome it may appertain, be cited at the ſaide day, to our ſaid court of Parlament at Paris, in the ſaid great chamber of pleading, to maintaine and defend their ſaid iudgements and executions, and of the ſaid letters pattentes, and the proceedinges and other wronges and greefes, and to ſee them repaired, corrected and amended, if neede ſo require; if not, to proceede further according to reaſon, and to adiourne at the ſaide day the ſaide people of our Parlament of Prouence, to appeare in our ſaide Court by Sindic or Proctor, who ſhalbe appointed by them to defend the ſaide appellations, and anſwere to our ſaide Proctor, and likewiſe the ſaid Minier, De la Fond, de Tributijs &amp; Badet, and other the aduerſe parties of our ſaide Proctor if any there be; commaunding them that they be and appeare, at the ſaide daie in our ſaide Court, if they ſee it needfull, and that the ſaide appellations may any waies touch them or appertaine vnto them: making vnto them ſuch inhibitions and forbiddances as are in ſuch caſes required, to which our ſaid Court of Palament of Paris, in the ſaid chamber of pleading, of our ſpeciall grace, full of puiſſance and royall authoritie, we haue (as is aboue ſaide) attributed, and do attribute, the cognoiſance and deciſion of the ſaide appellations, notwithſtanding any eſtabliſhing of our ſaide Parlament of Prouence, or any appointments giuen by our ſaid Commiſsioners, vpon the requeſt of our ſaid Proctor, ioyned to the criminal proces, with the firſt appellations already pleaded, wheerin we wil not preiudice our ſaid Proctor, and what other edicts ſoeuer, cōmandements, reſtraints &amp; forbiddances to the contrary notwithſtanding: from which, wherin it ſhalbe needfull, we haue derogated and doe derogate of our ſaid puiſſance &amp; authority by theſe ſaid preſents; for ſuch is our pleaſure.
                  
                     Yeouen at Montereau the 17. of March, in the yeare of grace 1549. of our Raigne the 3.
                      So by the King.
                  
                     
                        Sealed with the great ſeale of yellow waxe, vpon a ſingle Lable.
                     
                  
               
            
            Theſe letters of euocation being ſignified, and the Parlament of Paris poſſeſſed of the cauſe, there appeared in perſon the Preſident Minier L. of Opide, de la Fond, de Tributijs &amp; Badet, and the ouerplus of the Parlament of Aix by a Proctor. The cauſe was pleaded in the great Chamber of the Pallace, by the moſt famous aduocates of that time, Riant was for the King, Robert for the Iudges of Prouence, Auberi for thē of Merindol &amp; Cabrieres, an other for the Lady of Cantal, to the number of 12. &amp; their pleadings and declarations endured a long time, more then 50 hearings. Euery man ran thither out of al parts to hear ſuch matters as neuer were heard the like, for exceſſe of cruelty: and albeit the Aduocates of the Plaintifes parte did not recite the tenth parte of that which was, yea rather diſſembled the cauſe for which ſo much innocent bloud had bene ſhed, yet ſo it was as all men were rauiſhed with a kinde of aſtoniſhment, hearing ſo great and ſtrange matters, an occaſion that euery man expected

a laſt iudgement worthy of the matter, after ſuch and ſo long pleadinges, but in the end from ſo high mountaines there can come out but a very little ſmoke, which alſo very ſuddenly doth euaporate it ſelfe into a clowde out of the ſight of men: the Preſident Minier cheefe in all accuſations, hauing beene a long time detained priſonner, attainted, and conuinced of whatſoeuer they would lay to his charge, in the end eſcaped their hands:Guerin hanged at paris. the Aduocate Guerin being hanged at Paris, Minier found meanes not only to eſcape, but alſo to be reſtored to his former eſtate, after hauing promiſed and aſſured, that he would clenſe Prouence of theſe new Chriſtians, yea &amp; that all his life long he would be reuenged, for that by their occaſion he was driuen ſo neere his neck verſe. Let vs now look back into the deſſeines of K. Henry, who prepared himſelf to lead an army, for the Proteſtants ſuccour of Germany againſt the Emperour.
            
               The voiage of the army of Henry King of Fraunce, for the ſuccour of the proteſtant princes of Germany, againſt the Emperour Charles the fifth.K. Henry 2. hauing aſſigned day and place to ſuch forces as hee would conduct to the ſuccour of the Germanes againſt the Emperour, which amounted nere to 25000. Fantaſſins of French, 7000. Lanſeknights, 1200. men of armes, with their archers, two thouſand light horſe, and as many harquebuſiers, mounted vnder the Duke D'aumalle, went to holde his bed of iuſtice in the Parlament of Paris, where hauing admoniſhed euery man of his duty, aduertiſed his ſubiects of his enterpriſe, &amp; made a number of ordinances as well for the reformation of iuſtice, as the diſcipline of war, and ordained the Admirall D'Anebaut Viceroy throughout Fraunce, cauſing the Conſtable to march before with the auantgarde, he paſſed on his way to Ginuille, where the Dowager of Lorraine preſented her ſelfe, to yeelde her ſelfe with her ſonne, and the whole Duchie into his protection, and alſo to excuſe her ſelfe of ſome intelligences,Priuiledges of Metz debated. which it was reported ſhe had with his enemies; afterwards ſhe retired herſelfe to Blamont: from Toulh the Conſtable auanced the army right to Metz, the deputies wherof had vntil that time debated of their ancient priuiledges, confirmed by a number of Emperours and Kinges of Fraunce, offring notwithſtanding victualles to the whole army, without that any other ſauing the K. with certaine Lordes might enter in: but the Conſtable who as the ſtronger, would not debate ſuch pretences, by any other lawes, then the right of the Cannon, hauing limited vnto them a day for their laſt anſwere, reſolued to enter therein with 2. Enſignes of 600. men, which being doubled, they were found ſo long, that the firſt which were entred had meanes enough to repel the inhabitants,Metz, Toulh, Verdun, Nancy, &amp;c. taken by the French. whilſte that the reſt entred peecemeale to aſſure that Towne, the tenth day of Aprill to the Flower de lys: in the meane time that the King entred in armes within Toulh, followed with his whole traine, the Heralds of armes clad in their Crimſon veluet coates, azured, thick embrodered with Flowers de lys, with their Trumpets,Priuiledges of the townes maintained. Clarions, after hauing ſworne to maintaine their priuiledges, and reformed the gouernement and pollicie at his pleaſure, he aduanced forwards to Nancy cheefe Cittie of Loraine, where came forth to meete him, the yong Duke, cōducted by the earle of Vaudemont his vnckle, &amp; ſundry others. The K. hauing made his entry as at Toulh, ordained there Vaudemant Gouernour of the Cuntry, to the profite of the Duke, and hauing prouided him of his eſtate, he ſent him vnder the charge of Bordillon to Reimes, where were the Dolphin and his brethren: after going further, and approching neere Metz, he ſaw his army in this manner. There were three ſquare battailes of Fanterie,The armie of Fraunce repreſented in the fielde, and firſt the Fanterie. of which the firſt was of the olde enſignes, paied &amp; entertained in the time of the late K. for the wars of Piemont, Champagne, &amp; Boulogne, with other new companies, leuied in the beginning of theſe warres (without cōprehending therin any ſouldiers of marke, or yong gentlemen who were there for their pleſure and without paye) to the number of betweene 15. and 16000. men, whereof

betweene nine and ten thouſand were armed with Corſelets, Bourguinots with beuers, vambraces, gauntelets and taſes, downe to the knee, carrying long ſtaues, and the greateſt parte a Piſtoll at their girdle: and betweene a fiue and ſixe thouſand harquebuſers, armed with iacks and ſleeues of mayle, with rich Morions, and of goodly workemanſhip, a harquebuſe or handgun, bright, well poliſhed and light, their furniture exquiſite and braue, the reſt being armed according to the qualitie of their perſons. The ſecond battaile was of Gaſcoines, Armignacs, Baſques, Bearnois, Languedois, Perigourdins, Prouenceaux, and Auuergnacs: making ſhew betweene ten and twelue thouſand men, experte, and vſed to the warre, as well at Sea as land, whereof betweene eight and nine thouſand carried long ſtaues, armed with corſelets, and almane riuets, and two or three thouſand harquebuſers, with mailes and morions. The third was of Germanes, to the number of 7. or 8. thouſand, vnder the Count Ringrafe their Colonell; men of warre &amp; aſſured, as they made good proofe in their order, and march of battaile, wel enough armed according to their manner, as wel Pikes as ſhot.The men at armes and light Caualierie. Touching the men of armes, and light Caualerie, the whole was ordained by ranckes vpon the flancks of theſe battails, in number of 1000 or 1100. men at armes, with the company of archers. The men at armes were moūted vpon great Rouſsins, or courſers of the realme, Turkes and Ginets, with bardes of of ſuch colours in ſilke, as the Captains caried from the crown of their head to the ſole of their foot, with head peeces and pouldrons, the lance, the ſword, the dagger, the courtlaſſe, or the Mace, with reckoning their traine of other horſes, wheron were their ſeruants &amp; groomes: ouer all which right well appeared the cheeftaines and members of theſe companies, and other great Lords, very richly armed with gilte, &amp; cunningly engraued harneſſe, vppon readiehorſes, barde and capariſond, with bards and of ſteele, light and rich, or els of ſtrong mayle and light, couered ouer with Veluet, cloth of golde and goldſmiths worke, and Embroderers, with great magnificence. The archers lightly armed carrying the halfe lance, the piſtoll at ſaddle pommell, the ſworde or the courtlaſſe, mounted vpon horſes ſturring, and curuetting at pleaſure, among which according to the power of eche one, nothing was forgotten to ſet forth himſelfe, who ſhould doe beſt.Light Caualerie. As touching the light Caualerie, there might be neere 2003. light horſe, which were armed with corſelets, vambraces, and bourguinots, the half lance or piſtoll, the courtlaſſe, if it ſeemed good, or the Gelderſword mounted vpon caualins, double courtals or horſe well ſhaped and very ſwift.Harquebuſiers mounted. The harquebuſiers on horſeback were between 12. &amp; 1500. armed with iacks &amp; ſleeues of maile, or curats, the Bourguinot, or the morion, the harquebuſe of 3. foot long at the ſaddle pummel, mounted vpon good courtals, euery man according to his ability, vnder the Duke of Aumaile, generall of al the light Caualerie. There was alſo 3. or 400. engliſhmen departed out of their country to practiſe the war, vnder a certain Lord, vpon geldings and little nags, ſwift &amp; prompt,Engliſhmen. without being much armed, clad in ſhort Ierkins &amp; red caps, according to their mā
               ner, and a lance like a halfe pike, which they very well know how to handle, They are good men, deſirous to know and exerciſe the warres, as ſuch haue very well proued as haue bene with them. But as all men muzed much at the ſight of this armie, euen ſuch as were appointed to keep the baggage, a number of ſouldiers, ſeruāts &amp; peſants, come out of Theonuille brake in, cheefely on the ſide of the Lance-knightes, from whom they caried the better, before people could be appointed to follow thē, which occaſioned ſince many yong Frenchmen, eſpecially of the light horſe, to attache the garriſon, and to try thēſelues, againſt thoſe of Theonuille with more pleaſure &amp; warlike exerciſe notwithſtanding, thē harme that happened to the one part or the other.
            
               
               The K. army before Metz.The King hauing taken great pleaſure at the order, equipage, behauiour, and ſalutation, which all they did vnto him, commanded them to march continually in battaile, armed at all peaces, afterwards he was ſaluted by his artillerie, placed a little aboue the army, within the vignes vpon a platforme: to wit, 16. great Canons, 6. long Culuerines, 6. leſſer, 12. baſtard culuerins, the whole conducted by D'Eſtre, great maſter and generall of the artillerie of Fraunce: the next morrowe the King entred into Metz, at the gate Champanoiſe, with great magnificence vnder a Canapie, carryed by foure of the beſt Gentlemen of marke in the Countrie, marching after the Officers, the Cleargie before followed by Cardinals, then the Conſtable barehead, armed at all peaces, bearing a naked Sworde before the King, who at the gate of the great Temple ſware vpon the Euangeliſts to maintaine them in their rights and ancient priuiledges:The K. entry into Metz, and priueledges graunted to the towne. after hauing giuen order to the gouernement and fortifications, aboue all to cut the towne, to raiſe there a rampier vpon the height of a mount, which commaunded, and hauing lefte Arthus de Coſſe called Gonor, brother to the Marſhall Briſſac gouernor, with 200. light horſe, a cōpany of ordinance, twelue enſignes for the garde of victuals which from all partes was to come to the army, he departed the 20. of Aprill, after his Auantgare ledde by the Conſtable: and leauing behinde him in forme of arreregarde, foure hundred men at armes, with a number of light horſe, to aduaunce and aſſure the rearegarde, in like ſorte the three troupes marched continually in battaile, and all their armes on their back, how dangerous a time and place ſoeuer they found. An occaſion that many, who before had liued at great eaſe and delicacie, died: and many more for hauing drunke too much of thoſe olde waters, fel ſick at their returne. The armie reſted two dayes in the faire and rich plaine of Sauerne, about the beginning of May 1552. to refreſh the Souldiers, after the Caualiere gaue within one league of Strasbourg. In the meane ſeaſon, and while the King remained at Sauerne, to repoſe his armie, and attende newes from the Germane Princes, they of Strasbourg wiſe by the example of the Meſsins, negociated with the King, as well for the commoditie of his armie,The K. aprocheth to Strasbourg. as ſuretie of their towne: the King had already demaunded them to prouide victuals for the armie, and for that cauſe they deputed Pierre Sturme, Goteſſem, and Sleiden, who brought vnto him great quantity of Come and wine, but the Conſtable no whit regarded what they offered, by reaſon of the greatnes of the armie: And albeit the Embaſſadors were departed from him in ſuch ſorte, that they were to aduertiſe the Senate, and after to yeeld him anſwere: yet the very next morning he ſent two gentlemen,The K, demaund to them of Strasbourg. by whom he preſſed thē to anſwere with a long diſcourſe of the Kings good will towards Germany, and for what cauſe he had entred into armes, and bene at ſo great a charge: to wit, to recouer their libertie, now eſlaued by the Imperials, his other demaund was, that by reaſon the men at armes, ſtoode in need of ſundry things, that it might be lawfull for them to buie them within the town, and that it might be permitted to the artificers, to bring their ware to the Campe, and ſell it there: whereupon the Senate anſwered, that in matters of ſo great importance, they were not accuſtomed to conclude of ought, but by aduiſe of the generall councell of all their Seignory, and that after hauing conſulted with them, they would ſend Deputies to declare their minde, ſo leaue being giuen them to departe, the next morrowe, the ſame men were ſent to the Campe, which as yet remayned at Sauernes. Their tale being heard, ioyned thereto that they brought a little more munition then at firſt, and their reaſons ſet downe why they might not ſuffer anye men at armes to enter the towne, the Conſtable began to ſpeake in choller: and in deliuering how vniuſtly they iudged of the benefites of the King, and of the iniuries

of the Emperour, he added certaine biting tearmes, the end of his tale was that the next morrow the King would ſpeake with them in perſon, and confirme whatſoeuer he had vttered. The ſame daye the Embaſſadours repaired to the King, with whom was the Cardinal of Lorrain, the Prince of Vendoſme, and the Conſtable, where they recited as much as had bene deliuered by them to the Conſtable, at two parlies, and preſented vnto him as much Oates as they had done before Wheate, and a little more Wine; beſeeching him that for the ancient amitie which the ſignorie of Strasbourg had with the King of Fraunce, and for his owne curteſie, hee would take in good parte their offer, the rather for that there was a great Garriſon within the Towne, called thether for feare of ſurpriſe, and a great number of Paiſants were likewiſe retired thither out of the Countrie, which cauſed the Cittie not to be ſo well able to ſpare her prouiſion. The King after hauing conferred with his Councell, began himſelfe to repeate the cauſe which made him come into Germany, in like ſorte as the Conſtable had the day before deliuered, how that victuals was a matter moſt neceſſary, and not to be denyed to any perſon in the warde, offring to pay for them, were he not an enemy, otherwiſe if his ſtoode in any need, he would finde meanes to finde it, coſt as it could, which would turne to a great damage, as euery man might perceiue. In the meane time he refuſed nothing which was offred, but would needs haue bread, the Deputies on the other ſide beſought him that hee would be contented with corne: as they could not fall to agreement, ſo away they went without doing ought, the Deputies being returned into the Towne, the Senate ordained, that albeit they were not able to deliuer any of the Corne within the towne, yet they ſhould make bread in the Countries neere hand, as much as they might be able, for they had both tolde the King and the Conſtable, that the eſtate of the towne and diſpoſition of the time was ſuch, as they were not to tarrie for ought, but if they could reape any thing of the Countries about, they would moſt willingly parte with it. The which the Senate had ordained, to the ende no wrong might be offred to the people of their Villages, nor their goods, ſo whatſoeuer could be found in any the Towns or Villages, was carried to the Campe, but it was no great matter.

they beſought him then that hee would encline his hart to the making of a peace, of which as they had alreadye ſpoken to the Emperour, ſo would they againe deale with him, hauing a good hope thereof. As touching his demaund of making an allyance betweene them, they beſought him to haue regarde to their honour and good renowne, for that they could not by any meanes perfourme, by reaſon of their faith, by which they were bound to the Empire; notwithſtanding they would employ all their endeuours to the eſtabliſhing of a publicke peace. Moreouer they moſt affectionately beſought him not to endemnifie the territorie of Strasbourge, which is a free Cittie of the Empire, and that at his requeſt Albert Duke of Brandebourg, would more curteouſly entreate the B. of Wicibourg. At the very ſame time, to wit, the eleuenth of May, Maurice ſent letters to the King, wherein was contained all that had bene done at Lincy, where the confederate Princes of Germany had entreated of certaine articles of peace with Ferdinand, who negociated the ſame for the Emperour, of whoſe parte he had promiſed a good and prompt reſolution, for the benefite and quiet of all Germany. In like ſorte he required of the King (whom he would ſhould be comprehended in the ſame treatie of peace) that hee would ſet downe vnder what conditions he would compound with the Emperour. Theſe letters being receiued contrary to his expectation, and knowing well that the Queene of Hungary with troupes of men of warre, had taken Satenay, and burned whatſoeuer ſhe met without defence, iudging beſides of Maurices purpoſes as he thought good, he determined of his returne, ſo as hauing deuided his army into three partes, the better to conduct it with fewer diſcōmodities, and to make it march by diuers waies, and yet arriue altogither at one place, he left Germany; but before his departure hee anſwered to the Princes Deputies,The K. anſwer to the Deputies. that he had obtained that, for which hee was come into Germany with all his army, for the Captiue Princes ſhould be deliuered which was the occaſion of the warre: hee had then attained glory enough, if euer it ſhould happen that Germany ſhould ſtand in neede of him, he would neither ſpare trauaile nor expence, nor would faile to put himſelfe againe into all dangers, for to ſuccour them; at this preſent he would retire into his owne Realme with his armye, for hee vnderſtoode that the enemy did ouerrunne his Countrie. As touching the complaintes of the poore people, he receaued great diſpleaſure thereat, but diſcipline can neuer be ſo good in a Campe, but that militarie licence will breede ſome damage; for his owne parte he gaue the beſt order that he was able, that no man ſhould be intereſſed, if not, yet the leaſt that might be, and that the offendors ſhould be rigorouſlye puniſhed: As touching that which they wrote of the Emperour, and of a peace, he referred himſelfe to them; through his trauaile, diligence and proweſſe, Germany ſtode now freed from thoſe miſeries in which ſhe ſtoode enwrapped: henceforward it was for them to looke to it, that they did not villanouſly looſe that liberty, which he ſo honourably had rendred vnto them, he could not deny their demaund, on the behalfe of thoſe of Strasbourge, albeit that at ſuch time as hee was with his armye vpon their marches, many behaued themſelues inſolently and immodeſtly towards his people; notwithſtanding to entertain his confederates, and to haue a man alwaies in Germany, which might aſſure him of the true eſtate of the affaires, as they paſſed betweene the Imperialles and the confederates, and the better to be aduertiſed of the Emperors intents, he lefte Du Freſne B. of Bayonne his Embaſſadour about Maurice, who did there as you ſhall vnderſtand, after hauing repreſented vnto you the eſtate, in which in the meane time ſtoode the armies of the Emperour, and of Maurice ioyned with his allies, together with the conduct and laſt end of their enterpriſes; in which it ſhalbe an

eaſie matter for you to iudge, what fauours and diſaduantages the K. of Fraunce his armye brought to the one ſide and to the other.
            We haue before tolde you how Maurice was departed from Lincy,The exploits of Maurices army vpon the Emperors troupes. where they had articulated certaine conditions of peace, Ferdinand ſuddainly after the aſſembly, took his iourney to Enipont towards the Emperour, to make him vnderſtand the whole. In the meane time Maurice being come backe to the Campe, drew towards the Alpes with his companions, where being egged forward by the Embaſſadour of Fraunce, he determined to ſet vppon thoſe troupes which the Emperour had cauſed to be leuyed in that countrie, ſo as the 17. day of May approching neere vnto Fieſſe, a Towne ſcituate at the entrie of the Alpes vpon the riuer Lech, and hauing vnderderſtoode by his ſpies ſent to deſcry the countenance of the enemyes, how they had ſeaſed on all the ſtraites, and had ſo enſconced themſelues, as it was vnpoſsible to doe them harme, he contented himſelfe to ſend certaine of the cheefeſt, which galloped euen to their Campe, and tooke ſome, which they brought away with them,The princes gaine the ſtraites of the mountaines, among whome they tooke Langue du Keſte. The next morrow aduancing forward with the Infanterie, 200. men at armes, arriued at the ſtraites of the mountaines, which about 800. of the Emperours ſouldiers kept with two fielde peeces, but they quickly ſeuered them, ſo as they being put to flight, ſufficiently aſtoniſhed thoſe which were nere vnto Rute, the rather for that the Princes following them foote by foote in ſuch ſort, ſet vpon the reſt, that they defeated them, in killing about one thouſand, and ſundrie other as well taken as drowned within the Riuer of Lech, with an Enſigne there lefte behinde.
            The next morrowe they battered the forte of Ereberge, with ſo good hap as they tooke the fortreſſe ſeated on the top of the Caſtle, thereby rendring themſelues maſters of the Cauſie, and of the great Cannons which they found there, which done they clambred vp the mountaine, ſtrong and painefull, euen to the Caſtle, albeit the bullets fell among them like haileſtones, notwithſtanding which, it was for all that rendred vp vnto them, by 13. Enſignes of foote, whereof nine were taken,The defeating of the Emperors people. and foure ſaued themſelues, and among them three were of Germanes, and three of Italians, about two thouſand priſoners were led away, with ſome loſſe of the other; this done, and as Maurice would haue gained the Cauſey, the ſouldiers ouer whome Rifeberg had charge, refuſed to goe on any further,Sedition in Maurices Campe. except they might receaue extraordinary wages, by reaſon of the taking of Ereberg: whereupon hauing cauſed one of the ſeditious perſons which cryed out higheſt to be taken, the reſt did not onelye bende their Pikes againſt him, but many in like ſorte ſhot a number of bullets at him out of Harquebuſes, in ſuch ſorte as he hardly ſaued himſelfe: in the end notwithſtanding the Chiefetaines appeaſed all, and the 21. of May, two regimentes were ſent by the Alpes to Enipont, which was but two dayes iourney thence, the Cauallerie remayning with a regiment of Fantaſsins about Fieſse and Rute, to keepe the paſſage:The Emperour flyeth. then Maurice and the Princes allied, followed the next morrowe, and ioyned with the Infanterie neere Ziole, diſtant from Enipont two leagues; an occaſion why the Emperour hauing receiued newes of the winning of Ereberge, departed from Enipont in the night in great haſte and much trouble, with his brother Ferdinand, who was come thither but a little before to perſwade a peace, as hath beene tolde you, ſo as by keeping the way of the mountaines on the lefte hand, which leadeth to Trent,The D. of Saxe deliuered out of priſon, but followeth the Emperour throughout Germany. he retired himſelfe to Villac a towne of Cornia vpon the Diane: he likewiſe had ſet at libertie a little before that, Iohn Frederic Duke of Saxe, whome hee had cauſed to be ſhutte vp in priſon fiue whole yeares together, and now releaſed him, for feare leaſt

the enemy ſhould arrogate the ſame to his glorie, which likewiſe the captiue was not himſelfe deſirous of: being at liberty, he notwithſtanding accompanied the Emperour whether ſoeuer he went.
            
               Maurice being arriued at Enipont, whatſoeuer was found lefte of the Emperours ſtuffe, or appertaining to any of the Spaniards, or to the Cardinall of Ausbourg, was pilled, but no harme was offred to the goods of Ferdinand, nor of the Citizens: And for ſo much as there reſted then but three dayes of the truce, which had beene accorded in reſpect of the future treatie, Maurice wēt from thence to Paſſau, but the princes his companions, returned backe the ſame way they came, and rendred thēſelues at Fieſse the 20. of May; and afterwardes publiſhed letters at Ausbourg, as well in their owne name as in Maurices, in theſe tearmes.
            
               
                  The confederate Princes letters againſt the Emperour, for religion, and the liberty of Germany.
                  WHereas in our former wrightings we haue affirmed that our entrance into armes, was for the defence of religion, and the liberty of Germany, the matter it ſelf &amp; our bound dutie doth require that we ordaine ſufficient Doctors for the Churches, and inſtruction of youth, for it is moſt cleare and hath not any need of more ample proofe, how the enemies of the truth haue euer employed all their force to deſtroy the good Doctors, thereby to eſtabliſhe their Popiſh Idol, and cauſe youth to encreaſe therein, being nouriſhed in theſe errours, and falſe doctrines, for euen at that inſtant when they durſt not publickly ſpeak their mindes of religion, they then ſtudied by all meanes to roote out at the very bottome all true doctrine, and not onely haue they impriſonned the good doctors,Miniſters and Schoolemaſters reſtored by the Proteſtant princes in Germany. but likewiſe in this very towne vnlooked for, and with great inhumanity haue they conſtrained them by oath to departe out of the whole teritorie of the Empire: and albeit that this oath be moſt wicked, and not grounded vpon any right or equitie, yet to take away all occaſion of detraction, we haue reuoked the ſelfe ſame Miniſters and Schoolmaſters which our aduerſaries had chaced hence: wherefore we declare all thoſe abſolued, which haue beene caſt out by meanes of the band wherewith they ſtood bound through their oath: we reſtore them to their full libertie, with commaundement that not onely in this cittie, but alſo in all other places they preach the word of God purely, and according to that confeſsion which hath bene heere at other times preſented, and teach their youth rightly and holeſomelye in good learning, relying vpon our ſuccour and protection. We forbid in like ſorte, that none taunt thē with any iniurious worde, as if they had done ought againſt their faith and oath, conſidering that without any deſerte, but meerely for confeſsion of the truth, that they haue already liued many moneths in exile, we make no doubt but good men wil greatly pittie them, and eſteeme them worthy of being ſuccoured and releeued with all fauour. And for ſo much as thoſe which in the abſence of the other haue taught in this Cittie, be men ſuſpected and vnconſtant, ſo as by reaſon of their diuers faſhion of teaching they may not be commodiouſly with thoſe which we haue called home. We require the Senate to take from them the chaire, and to carry themſelues in ſuch ſorte as this our preſent Edict may remaine in force.
               
            
            After that the Princes had publiſhed theſe letters the 7. of Iune, fiue dayes after they inſtalled againe the Proteſtant Miniſters in their places, and gaue them againe a great charge to preach, to the wonderfull reioycing and pleaſure of the people.
            
               Maurice went his way in the meane time to Paſſau to entreat of peace, where the firſt of Iune all that had beene handled at Lincy was repeated,Maurice his complaint againſt the Emperour. and the whole matter ſet downe and explaned at large by Maurice. There were preſent the Emperors embaſſadours, King Ferdinand, Albert D. of Bauiere, the Biſhops of Salisbourg and Deiſtet,

and the Embaſſadours of all the Princes Electors of Cleues, and of Witemberg. Maurice greatly complained how the common wealth of the Empire, which ought to be the freeſt of all other, was gouerned by ſtrangers, how the authoritye of the Princes Electors, was from day to daye diminiſhed, how many thinges were done without euer once demaunding their aduice, how ſundrye appertinances were diſmembred, and cleane aliened from the Empire, and the meanes ſought how their right might be vtterly taken away from the chuſing of the Emperour, how in the imperiall daies for the moſt part they left behinde the opinions of the Electors, how the particular aſſemblies of the Electors remained there, I know not with what feare how their iuriſdiction diminiſhed, for ſo much as contrarye to the ancient cuſtome the Chamber receiued the griefes and complaints of thoſe, which were the appellants of that which they had ordained: the differents of the eſtates of the Empire were therby increaſed, and could not be pacified vntil both partes were greatly intereſſed, how it grew to too great an expence and trouble, but to haue audience in the Emperours Court, for that cauſes could not ordinarily be throughlye vnderſtoode, for want of well vnderſtanding the language: how not onely great charge grewe thereof, but much time there ſpent without any profit; how at the imperiall dayes there was ſmall amitye, for if any one propoſed ought for the benefite of the cōmon wealth, it was ſtrait conſtrued in the worſt part, how Germany drew it ſelfe clean dry through theſe ſo often and long aſſemblies, and in the meane time many things went to racke at home, and yet for all that the publicke eſtate waxed not better but worſe, and ſtil enwrapped in more miſeries, how it was forbidden by a rigorous Edict, that none ſhuld be entertained in wages by ſtrangers, how ſuch as are reconciled are bound not to carrie armes againſt any of the Emperours prouinces, and by that means are ſeperate from the Empire; how thoſe which in the warre of Smalcade ſerued but their owne Lords, were condemned in great fines, and how they leuied monie in like ſorte of thoſe, which during the ſaide warre continually remained in the amitye of the Emperour, yea vpon paine of ſeeing their goods ſolde before their eyes, except they made a quick diſpatch; and becauſe their Deputies accorded together, incontinently proclamation was made that they ſhould departe from the Court vpon paine of death; how often they had brought ſtrangers, men at armes into Germany, and after the laſt watre diſperſed them throughout the prouinces, where they committed a thouſand villanies and diſorders, and bragging how they had tamed Germany, and boaſted that ſhe ſhould be annexed to the Emperours patrimony, and how in the cheefe and principall Citties ſhould be erected fortes and bulwarkes to bridle them in, how as it were in mockery, they carried out of Germany to ſtrange nations great quantity of peeces of artillerie, and furniture of warre; how ſome for extreme couetouſnes of vaine glorye, haue engraued in ſuch peeces as they cauſed to bee newe caſt, the armes of the Princes of Germanye, as who would ſay that they had wonne them from them; how they had imprinted little bookes, yea with priuiledge of the Emperour, to the great diſhonour of Germany, as if ſhe had bene vtterly tamed and brought into bondage; how at publique aſſemblies ſome were receaued to the number of the Princes and eſtates, vnder the name of the Emperours prouinces, which was craftily done, to the end that the number being encreaſed, they might gain their wils by multitude of voyces; how foure yeares paſſed they had erected a Parlament of the Chamber, and how lawes were priuatelye made by ſome, and ſince publiſhed not without the great damage of a number, and eſpecially of thoſe, of the religion of Ausbourg, for they gaue vnto them no place at all in this aſſemblye; it is then moſt

neceſſary, ſaid he, that the lawes ſhould be examined at the very firſt aſſembly, Maurice propoſed theſe things and ſundry other more, requiring to haue them amended, conſidering how they touched the Empire, and that the Empire might be reſtored to her antient brightnes, and that it might not be lawfull for other to ſcoffe them or deſpiſe them: the Commiſſioners after hauing conſulted together, iudged that theſe demaunds contained nothing in them but great equitie, and yet to the ende the Emperours honour might be preſerued, and that himſelfe might the rather be perſwaded thereunto, they were of opinion that many matters which concerned the reformation of the publique eſtate might very well be reſerued to an imperiall day.
            There was alſo Du Freſne the French Embaſſadour, who made his oration in full audience of all the Princes,The French Embaſſadors oration. the 13. of Iune, ſaying: 
                  That in olde time and long before euer the name of French was heard of among men, there had bene ſo great a conformitie of life betweene the Gaulois and the Almans, that at other times they were called by the Latins, Germanes, as brethren to the Gaulois: but after that the French had ſeated themſelues in Gaul, the two nations were ſo vnited together, that it was one ſelfe ſame Empire, vnder the ſame Prince and the ſame lawes. Afterwards as in change of time the empire was transferred to Germany, ſo did the Saxons and other Emperours alwaies entertaine amitie with the French, for becauſe they were deſcended from the Kings of Fraunce: in ſuch ſorte as Philip Auguſtus cauſed to be engraued in letters of golde, that ancient alliance which was as it were cleane aboliſhed thorough antiquitie, and to be ſet vp in the moſt holye place, and not without cauſe, for whileſt that this coniunction endured, the common welth of both the people flouriſhed, and the force of Germany was ſo great, as it gaue lawes not onely to the Hungarians, Bohemians, Pollakes &amp; Danes, but alſo to the very Italians: and the Kings of Fraunce in like ſorte curious to amplifie Religion, did often beare armes againſt Sarazins, Turkes, and other enemies of Chriſtendome, through Aſia, Affrica, and Europe, in atchiuing of moſt glorious victories. Since that, we are come in a more vnhappie age, when as ſome Emperours as it were engraffed in, and not of the naturall ſtocke of Germanes, and vnworthye of their eſtate, haue cleane abandoned this amitie of the Kings of Fraunce: whereupon there enſued great misfortunes in the Common wealth. But this ſoare was healed by the grace of God, by meanes of the noble families of the Princes of Luxembourg, out of which ſome Emperours deſcended, men of high renowne, and great freendes to the Kings of Fraunce, for the Father of Charles the fourth died in fighting for the King of Fraunce. The Princes of Auſtria haue bene in like ſorte affected, among whome Albert the firſt could not poſsibly be induced by any of the Popes promiſes or threats, to make warre againſt Fraunce, which hee recited to the end it might be vnderſtoode, how ill ſome of the familiars and and ſeruants to the moſt puiſſant emperour Charles the fifth order the common wealth, not only ſeeking by all their trauell to diſioyne theſe two moſt excellent Nations the one from the other, but before this thorough their ſubtilties and wilines they haue preuailed ſo farre, as the moſt famous Prince King Frauncis was condemned for an enemy without being heard. It is true that that redounded to their particular profite, but to the great dammage of the Common-wealth, for it may euidently enough be perceiued, how hard a matter it is to decay the liberty of Germanye, and to build their Realme to make it laſt ſo great and ſo long, as the amity betweene theſe two nations hath endured, for becauſe at this preſent ſtanding in feare of the French armies, they proceede therein more ſlackely, and inſiſt not ſo liuely to impoſe their Spaniſh yoke: they be they for certaine, which haue obtained peace at the Turkes handes, by praiers and tributes, and who vnder colour of Religion and obedience, haue brought a thouſand enormities and factions into Germany, which haue beaten her with her owne rodde, warring againſt her with her owne power, which haue drawne monie from all, and rendred the condition of Germany into ſo pitious an eſtate, as may be wel ſeene by the Spaniſh Garriſons, diſpoſed on the one ſide and the other, which

haue vnfurniſhed thoſe places of armes where they were kept in ſtore, which haue made open the way to the examination of the treaſure, for it is growne to that paſſe at this day, that the ſeale of the Empire, and the iudgement of the Chamber, and the right or priuiledge of imperiall dayes, is in the ſleeue of the B. of Arras, for what meaneth this, to execute by way of iuſtice, or to baniſh in offring great rewardes to the murtherers? all thoſe, as for their maintenance, haue put themſelues into the wages of ſtrangers; I omit ſo many murthers, ſo many whordomes, pilferies, and ſackings of Citties, and aboue all religion; which now was handled of one ſorte, and now of another, accordingly as the time ſerued. Certes whatſoeuer hath beene done ſince ſome yeares paſſed, hath tended to no other end then to trouble the lawes of the Empire, or conſtraine or allure King Ferdinand by faire promiſes, as alſo to terrifie the Princes by feares and dreades, to the end the Prince of Spaine might be choſen Emperour: were it not rather to be wiſhed by men of valour, to dye then to ſee the light of the Sunne in ſuch miſeries and calamities? I doe not think that any man can be found ſo blockiſh or barbarous, that hee doth not feele himſelfe galled with theſe thinges. Therefore no man ought to maruell, if at the laſt ſome Princes haue bene found, and among them the Electour Maurice D. of Saxe, which ſtand reſolued to hazard their liues for the recouerie of the liberty of their common Countrie, and which finding themſelues too feeble, and not able alone to ſuſtaine the charge, haue demaunded ſuccour and alliance of the King of Fraunce, who cleane forgetting any miſlikes of the time paſſed, hath not onely employed thereto all his wealth and treaſure, but alſo hath not ſpared his owne perſon in a matter of ſo great conſequence: contracting an alliance with them, wherein among other thinges there is ſet downe, that they ſhall not make any accorde with the enemy, without the Kings good liking: and albeit that Maurice be bound thereunto, yet deſiring the proſperitie of the Countrie, and to accommodate himſelfe to Ferdinand, which did ſo earneſtly require it, he very lately beſought the moſt chriſtian King, to ſignifie vnto him, vnder what conditions hee would haue the peace treated of: that, to ſay the truth fell out otherwiſe then he hoped for, conſidering his benefite towards them to haue beene ſuch and ſo great, that hee thought it fitter to entreate neerer hand, and not ſo farre off, of matters which ſo neerely concerned him: neuertheleſſe forſomuch as he euer preferred the publick weale before his owne particular, hee would deny nothing to a Prince his allie: wherefore if the ſoares of the common wealth might be healed as they ought, and that good aſſurance may be giuen that in time to come they ſhall not be refreſhed; if the Captiue Princes may be releaſed vnder the conditions ſet downe in the treatie, further if the ancient alliances betweene Fraunce and the Empire, and the laſt Capitulation with Princes, may be ſo confirmed, as that for euer they may remaine in force: if theſe thinges I ſaye may bee well brought to paſſe, he is ſo affectionate to the Common wealth, that not onely he will willingly accord to a treatie of peace, but alſo yeeld moſt humble thanks to God, that herein he hath aided you with councell, and ſuccours. As touching priuate matters, as the Emperour hath detained from him many things by force, and made warre vpon him without any iuſt occaſion; the King thinketh it a matter very reaſonable, that he which hath beene the occaſion of the iniury, ſhould firſte ſhewe the way of ſatisfaction. The King in truth no whit diſtruſteth at all of his owne power, nor yet of the equitie of his cauſe, and notwithſtanding hee will giue them to vnderſtand how much hee loueth peace; and how much hee deſireth to agree with them all, and with Maurice.
            
            The Princes anſwered hereunto, that his diſcourſe fet from antiquitie,The confederate Princes anſwere to the French Embaſſadour. as concerning the coniunction of Germany and Fraunce, was moſt agreeable vnto them, and no leſſe that the King preferred the common wealth before his particular profite, making no refuſall to the confederate Princes accorde with the Emperour, for it is not onely the profite of one nation,, but of all Europe, which hauing beene turmoyled

with ciuill calamities, tended to an euident ruine. As for the conditions which the K. demaunded, they doubted not but that they might be obtained, for the Emperour alwaies bare good will towards the common wealth, both heretofore and in theſe preſent troubles, he neuer vnderſtoode that the libertye of Germany was any waies diminiſhed. There was likewiſe great hope that in very ſhort ſpace hee would ſet at libertie the Captiue Princes. As touching the renewing of their ancient alliances; the King well vnderſtandeth in his owne wiſedome, that a matter of ſo great weight could not be brought to paſſe in this aſſembly: notwithſtanding they greatly deſired that the amitie which euer had beene betweene the two nations might remaine firme and inuiolable: they likewiſe deſire aboue all the reſt, that the differentes betweene the King and the Emperour might be pacified, proteſting that therein they would neither ſpare trauaile not diligence whatſoeuer. But forſomuch as the K. ſaid that the Emperour did poſſeſſe ſundry places which appertained to him, and openly made ſhew of many which he would repeate; it ſeemed vnto them a matter very reaſonable, that he ſhould declare what they were, for they were determined fullye to infourme the Emperour thereof, and to be a meanes in the cauſe. Further they beſought the King to take the ſame in good parte.Familie of Luxembourg. That which the Embaſſadour ſpake of the familye of Luxembourg grew vpon this: Henry Earle of Luxembourg had a ſonne named Henry, who afterwards was the ſeuenth Emperour of that name, hee had a Sonne named Iohn, who by manage was King of Bohemia, and gaue ſuccours to Philip de Valois againſt Edward the third King of England, being preſent himſelfe in perſon at the day of battaile; but there remained hee, for that the Engliſhmen had the better. Among other he left Charles his eldeſt Sonne, who afterwardes was the fourth Emperour of that name, Father vnto Wenceſlaus and Sigiſmond, who both came after to be Emperours, and the latter was likewiſe King of Hungarie and Bohemia,Albert of Auſtria. and ſolicited the councell of Conſtance Albert of Auſtria of whom he ſpake, was Emperour ſonne to Raoul the Emperour, who alwaies entertained good amitie with Philip le Bel, King of Fraunce, albeit that Boniface the eight, enflamed him as much as poſsibly he could to make war. But it is now time to look back to the French.
            I haue tolde you how the King of Fraunce being come as farre as Strasbourge, with an armye of thirtie thouſand men, for the ſuccour of the Proteſtant Princes againſt the Emperour, afterwards reſolued of his returne, vnderſtanding of the Peace concluded betweene the Germanes, had deuided the body of his forces into three partes, to make them to march ſundry waies the eaſier, and with leſſe diſcommoditie of victuals;The Q. of Hungary cauſeth the K. army to returne. and eſpecially to encounter the ſooner the Q. of Hungaries army, which ſhe had to the borders of Chāpagne. This Princeſſe knowing how the affaires of the Emperor her brother, went but euen hardly by reaſon of thoſe occaſiōs which I haue made you to vnderſtand: and aboue al that this French armye would proue a croſſe girde to his intents, determined to retarde the ſame by ſuch troupes as ſhe could leuy throughout the lowe countries, which would bee in ſuch ſorte able to preiudice the realme; as the K. ſhould be enforced to returne for ſuccour of the ſame; and ſo hauing ſolicited Martin Vanroſſe, the baſtard and Marſhall of Cleues ſhe cauſed him to come downe into the duchie of Luxembourg, with 3000. ſouldiers of Cleues, Valois, and Geldres,The Imperials army in Luxembourg. aſsiſted with 600. horſe, all which being ioyned with Count Mansfielde, the gouernour of the Duchie, the Bailife of Auanes, the Gouernors of Cimetz, &amp; other chieftanes, made vp the number of 12000. Fantaſsins, &amp; 3000. horſe, with which they determined to enter into Fraunce, and there to doe the worſt they ſhuld be able; they

tooke Satenay vpon the Meuſe, by a Lorraine Captaines voluntarye deliuerye therof, which the Dowager of Lorraine had left there without other Garriſon; where ſuddenly they employed themſelues to repaire the breaches, and to reſtore it into his former eſtate, building of a bulwark behinde on the ſide of Dun le chaſteau, and a platforme towards La iuſtice. Now vpon the bruite that they ment to aſſaile Villefranche, Bourdillon went in with ſeauenteene horſe, and the ſame night made his company of men at armes to enter in, with as many men and prouiſions as hee was able, but being aduertiſed how they changing of their opinion were determined to returne to Mouſon, he lefte Chaſtellus his Lieutenant at Villefranche, iſſued from one of the antient houſes of Burgundie, with ſuch full authoritye as the Queene, and the Admirall D'Anebaut had giuen vnto him to commaund there; and with the reſt of his company entred at breake of day into Mouſon, where Roche de Maine was with his company of men at armes, and the three hundred Fantaſsins of the Barons of Cerny; but if the cheefeſt ſorte did not agree, much more were the inhabitants perplexed through the feeblenes of the place, commanded by a high mountaine neere vnto it, notwithſtanding any rampire which they were able to make to couer it: beſides, that the principall of the towne had already truſt vp their baggage; Bourdillon notwithſtanding hauing aſſured them of the Kings comming at hand, and hauing cauſed his cobbarde, and other more precious moueables to be brought in, and ſwearing not to abandon them, they a little aſſured themſelues. The Imperials for all that being ſaluted with the Cannon ſhotte of Villefranche, and councelled not to remain there, crept along the riuer, as farre as the village of Brioles, where they burned the Church and the forte, then to Mont-faucon which they burned, and ſo deſcended into the plaine, to put men into the Caſtle of Boulandre, which they took, by ſtealth getting of victuals and prouiſions, which they carried to Satenay: from thence all along the riuer they ſacked ſundry villages as farre as Grampre, a little Towne vpon Aire, neere Chalons and Atigni, where they reſted: and vnderſtanding how the Admirall hauing put the Legionaires of Champagne in armes, and vnited the Zuizers with the French men of warre, approched neere; they ſet fire on Grampre, Boulandre, and other places, to retire themſelues to Satenay, where they had intelligence that the light horſe of the Kings army who aduaunced forward, were already at Luxembourg: an occaſion that to retire themſelues, they all abandoned it, leauing the moſt parte of thoſe of Cleues and Geldres, for the aſſurance of Yuoy, if any ſhould goe about to force it. King Henry in the meane time, who heard the complaintes of theſe miſerable Subiectes, the ſooner to haſten the reuenge,The K. armie aduanceth forward. put out of his armye almoſt all the ſicke perſons, and lefte the baggage vnder the conduct of the Earle of Arraine, and Viſdome of Chartres with their companies, and ſome light horſe, and Harquebuſers mounted, for the conueying therof into Metz, or any other place which they ſhould think more aſſured: afterwardes the diſcamping of the imperials being known, &amp; the immoderate diligence vſed at the retiring of his troups, the conqueſt of the duchy of Luxembourg was deliberated of and reſolued to annex it vnto the crown, as a proper ſucceſſion fallē to the houſe of Vendoſme, by the death of the Conſtable S. Paul, true Lord &amp; peaceable poſſeſſor thereof, in carrying the name and armes, as the authors of that councel maintained, albeit that ſince that time Charles Duke of Burgondie had euer vſurped the ſame, the rather for that many neighbours therabouts ſaid that it was the very true refuge of theeues and outlawes, therefore did the armye drawe right to the Caſtle of Roc de Mars, all alongſt the Mozelle betweene

Treues and Theonuille, ſeated on the ſteepe of a hyll, ſtrong enough for ſcituation and fortification, with a little Towne beneath it, vnder the tytle of Viſcount. The Caſtle ſummoned made refuſall, for a number of Gentlemen, Ladyes, and other neighbours of reputation, were retired thither, imagining that the King would firſt employe his forces againſt Theonuille, and that at all aſſaies they might euer be receiued at an honourable compoſition after the firſt brunte. But the King contrariwiſe was councelled to attempte that, in reſpect of the victuals and prouiſions which the armye ſo much wearyed ſhould there finde, &amp; that the ſacking thereof might rather bee giuen to the Souldiers, how Theonuille was too ſtrong and well prouided,What place the army was firſt to attempt. to bee gotten in ſo ſhorte time, which they were not any waies to conſume but with aſſured profite, how thereby they ſhould looſe the occaſions of executing other thinges, how in the meane time they would fortefie the reſt of the places with all commodities: beſides how Theonuille ſtoode betweene Metz and that Caſtle, which they might ſo repaire, as the Garriſon of Theonuille ſhould be blocked in, and their prouiſions cleane ſtopped, which would be a meanes that in the end it ſhould likewiſe be rendred vp to the French, with leſſe charge, leſſe loſſe of time, and leſſe hazarde: ſixe Cannons were planted on the hill for batterye, two Culuerins battered againſt the wall, where there was but one groſſe ſquare tower for a flanker, and the Portall which ſerued for another. After betweene the towne and the Caſtle was dreſſed a battery beneath, right againſt a great Towre and a canton of the wall, ſo as they within beſieged, feeling the ſhaking of the Towres and walles, were not hard to Parley. But the Souldiers hauing the ſacking promiſed vnto them, fearing leaſt a Parley would cauſe a voluntary rendring, and neuer tarrying other volley of the Cannons, leapt into the ditches, which were deepe, high, and broad,Roc de Mars beſieged, battred, taken &amp; ſacked, by the French. whereof ſome clambering vp, others mounting with their Pikes to the wall, while the reſt were with wood and fire at the gates, ſo greatly aſtonied the beſieged, that all retired themſelues into Caues, Chambers, Sellers, and other ſecret places, to ſhun death, which was euen before their eyes; eſpecially after that ſome French men hauing found and broken open the gate of a Poſterne which went out of the baſe Courte into the Ditch, had made themſelues to be perceiued and feared on al parts, for that as ſoone as being mounted, they gaue entrye to all the reſt, which had no regarde but to throwe downe, rifle, and take all. At ſuch time as the Earle Ringraue Collonell of the Germanes, who did not imagine the taking thereof vpon ſuch a ſoddaine, went to beſeeche the King in conſideration of all his ſeruices, to ſpare vnto him that place, the Lady whereof was his neere Kinſewoman, which the King graunted vnto him, commaunding Coligny to cauſe the Souldiers to retire. Afterwards Mont S. Iean, Solieure, and other places were ſacked and burned, during the continuall and freſh skirmiſhes betweene the French and Imperialles before Theonuille; from whence the army being paſſed Eſtain, turned face to take againe the way of D'anuille, about which was already the Admirall d'Annebaut, with the Legionaires of Champaigne, 4. thouſand Suizers, and 200. horſe, with which he had alreadie hindred ſuch ſuccors, as Marcy gouernour of that place attended from his partakers: it is in a place plaine and fennie, but the hotte ſeaſon dry through the Solſtice of the Summer,Deanuille repreſented, beſieged, battred, and rendred to the K. diſcretion· was ſo fauourable to the approches of the French, that two thouſand Fantaſsins, and 3. hundreth light horſe ſince named Carabins, nor the Cannon ſhot could haue hindred the Artillerye from being planted on the toppe of the Caſtle ditche towardes the Medowe, without the battery from a little hill, of ſixe Culuerines,

to barre and annoye ſuch defences as it was very ill prouided of, albeit it was made at pleaſure, to the ende it might bee impregnable:The K. entry into Verdun. during theſe approches, the King made his entrye into Verdun, albeit it was full of the ſicke perſons of his armye, and after that the Cardinall had feaſted him at Dinner within the Biſhops Pallace, hee returned to viewe the batterye, which laſted from the fourteenth to the ſixteenth of Iune, making two breaches, whereof one was towardes the riuer, and the Caſtle ditche was for all that full of water the height of a Pike, and aboue that they were faine ſome to aſcende more then a fadome and a halfe: but as the Fanterye preſented themſelues at the aſſaulte, thoſe which were within refuſed of any compoſition, rendred themſelues in the ende to the diſcretion of the King, which was that the cheefe and principall perſons ſhould remaine Priſonners, that the Souldiers ſhould departe with white ſtickes downe, hauing full liberty to goe whether it pleaſed them beſt, the goods ſhould remaine to the Kings vſe, which hee afterwardes beſtowed (the artillerie reſerued) vpon the Earle of Coligny called Chaſtillon, whereat the Souldiers began to murmure, ſeeing themſelues fruſtrate of the ſacke of both thoſe places, being ill apparelled and little in their purſes by reaſon of their long voyage, and the moſt parte of them very ſicke. The Captaine Villefranche one of the cheefeſt men of marke among the olde bandes had the gouernement, but hauing beene hurte there with a Musket ſhotte, hee died: and Le Bruil a Bourgonian Gentleman, before Liuetenant to Salſedo, had his companye, and Rabodanges the gouernement.
            Whilſte that the King with promiſe of honourable entertainement receaued the Prince of Salerna, who greatly grew diſcontented with the Emperour, the Conſtable hauing vnderſtanding how the Earle Manfielde was gotten into Yuoy, wherof Strinchant was Gouernour, ſent to blocke him in with two thouſand foote,The Prince of Salerne quitting the Emperour commeth to the King. and a number of horſe, to hinder any goings foorth or entries in: after the reſt encamped there, the Earle ſhewing himſelfe a great husband of his prouiſions, and cauſing no ſallye to be made foorth, which proued not very hurtfull to the French. The Towne is ſcituate at the foote of a Mountaine,Yuoy and his repreſentation, ſiege, batterie and yeelding vp to the K. and on the other ſide is a medowe, and a faire ſpatious plaine, alongſt the which runneth La Cheſſe, a little Riuer which commeth towardes D'anuille, ſwelling greater hard by with many other brookes which fall into it: afterwardes it commeth into Meuſe neere Sedan. The greateſt parte of the Garriſon was of Germanes, Cleuois, and Geldrois, not accuſtomed to abide great famine nor long thirſte, no more then to ſuſtaine other diſcommodities of ſuch ſieges, with the Earls company of 100. men at armes, and 500. horſe, as well of the Gentlemen about; was of theſe Carabins, and Harquebuſiers mounted. They very wel perfourmed their duties by ordinary ſallies, and right ſharp skirmiſhes to hinder the aproches of the artillerie: but in the end it was planted in 2. places, as neere the brinke of the ditch of Mouſon ſide againſt a little Canton of a wall, which onely remained of the rampier, the height of 3. fadome and ſomewhat aboue, which battered in point blanck. They had ſet vpon the hill 6. culuerins, which ſpoiled all the ſtreetes and the length of the courtins, right on the backe of the breache, ſo as thoſe within beſieged, not ſeeing any walke ſure for them, without being ſcarred, and ſo neere their eares that the heare remained there, loſt their courage, and being with one conſent aſſembled vnder the hale and with them the braueſt of the companye, albeit that the greateſt breach could not holde fifteene men in front, beſides their trauerſes, trenches, traines, chanſſetraps, fricaſſes, and other deuices proper for the defence

of a breach: and albeit that the Earle were armed and readye of his charge, declared vnto them their dutie, the valewe and renowne of the Germane nation, with the diſhonour and loſſe as well of life as goods, which would enſue ſo cowardlye a reſolution, would make no other anſwere, but that if the French did aſſaile him before, they would diſpatch him behinde. In ſumme, ſeeing them the farre ſtronger, and notable but to curſe his life, and deteſt his ill happe; hee ſet a French Gentleman at libertie, to be a witneſſe of his dutie. Afterwardes being retyred with ſalte teares into his Chamber, Strinchant made a Trumpeter goe vpon the ſide of the trenches to demaund a parle of the Conſtable, which being graunted, Strinchant went out hoping of ſome aduantagious capitulation, which could be no other then that of D'anuille, ſo the Earle hauing learnedly and eloquently (as hee was very well ſtudied in learning, with the knowledge whereof hee honoured the profeſſion of armes) bewailed his miſerie vnto the Conſtable, was with the reſt of the cheefe caried to Paris. A notable example ſaid ſome of the French, for all ſuch as repoſing themſelues in any proſperitie paſſed, or in the merite of their owne valour, conſider not that the dutie of a Captaine is ſo inſeparably ioyned, to theirs which obey him, that hee ought to ſtand no leſſe aſſured, and before the blowe come, prouide for the ſame as well as his owne,The Gouernour of a place his dutie. except hee would fall into the like inconuenience that this Earle did. All the goods of Yuoy which were very great, were giuen vnto the Conſtable, who diſtributed the greateſt parte vnto his owne companye, and his ſonnes Montmorency, at which the olde bands openlye mutined, and after that began to breake themſelues, and to quit their Enſignes. So the Towne being rendred vp the three and twentith day of Iune, receaued Blaineau, afterwards Haucourt for Gouernour. Mommedy (which rendred it ſelfe life and Iewels ſaued) had the Captain Baron a Pariſian,Mommedy yeelded vp. a yong Souldier, but olde enough in warlike experience, with a hundred horſe and three Enſignes, D'anuille, Yuoy, Mommedy, Luxembourg; and the moſt parte of the Duchie, had beene before taken by Charles D. of Orleans, third ſonne to Frauncis the firſt, and after rendred againe by an agreement betweene the King and the Emperour;The firſt conqueſt of Luxembourg. but they were not then in ſo good ſtate, D'anuille was as then but a little borough Towne, and ſince all burned, and after reedified according to the fortifications at this day, with Bulwarkes, Baſtions, and platformes of defence, the rampires large and high,De An
                     •
                  ille. and of good holde, the whole newe repayred with walles of good ſtuffe.Yuoy. Yuoy was ſtrong, and not taken by aſſaulte, neither was there any reaſonable breache made to enforce it; but the Captaine Guelphe hauing inuented, and himſelfe made a great quantity of Mortier peeces, which ſhot exceeding great bullets from the hyll downe, ſo greatly aſtoniſhed them, that Gilles de Leuant, cheefe for the Emperour yeelded himſelfe, life and iewels, ſaued with ſome artillerie.
            During the ſiege of Yuoy, the Marſhall of Sedan heire to the houſe of La March, beſought the King that hee would helpe him to recouer his Duchie of Bouillon, which hee ſaide the Emperour vniuſtly detained from him,The Marſhall of Sedan heire to the houſe of La March, vndertaketh the conqueſt of the duchie of Bouillon. at the perſwaſion of the B. of Liedge, who gaue vnto him 4000. men and fiue peeces of artillerie, wherewith he battered the caſtle of Bouillon, which was ſeated vpon a high and ſteepe rocke, going out of a mountaine, from which it was ſeperate by a brode ditch and deepe, of an hundred and fiftie pace, in diameter, made by chiſell &amp; hammer with long trauell; in the plaine and circumference whereof, the better parte of the Caſtle is hewen out within the maine Rocke, with like workemanſhip almoſt in forme of Ouall, hauing

on the dich ſide a platforme ſo high, as it almoſt ouertoppeth one of the Mountains: at the foote whereof is a forme of Caſemate well perced, to keepe it from any aproches: on the other end is the Portall which goeth out of euerye ſide fifteene foote, with lightes to keepe the flankers, and which ſerue for the platforme, within it is a core of antient building, in forme of a ſquare Pauillion, couered with ſlate, which vnderneath hath his ſellers vauted within the very rock, with an excellent good Well of foureſcore fadomme, the Caſtle is perced to ſo good purpoſe, that a Chicken cannot peepe vp in any place, but it will be diſcouered; furniſhed with artillerie and all other prouiſions for a long ſeaſon, receiuing but one way vnto it, and that very narrow and painefull, the borough is vnderneath, in time paſt a faire towne, but ſo torne aſunder by the warres, that it remaineth almoſt vnhabited. Semoy which commeth towards Mommedy, runneth there with a mighty fall of ſtreame, eſpecially when it ſwelleth, by reaſon of the Winter raines and ſnowes, on the one ſide it is ſhadowed with another Mountaine, full of woods and craggie rockes, ſo ſharpe that it is almoſt vnpoſſible to dwell there, not to hurte the Caſtle on that ſide, not able to bring any Cannon, the reſt of the places are very lowe vallies and dangerous. The Marſhall notwithſtanding to make his troupes appeare greater then indeede they were, made his companies to paſſe and repaſſe many times in one ſelfe ſame place, to make it be thought that the whole French armye was there aſſembled: afterwardes hee planted his peeces vpon the Mountaine, but ſo vneaſily as they were faine to binde them hard with great and huge Cables for feare of tumbling downe,A wile to make ones troupes ſeeme greater and aſtoniſh the enemy. from whence there was not aboue ſix volleis ſhotte, hauing onely a little ſcratte the toppe of the wall with ſmall apparance of any breache, when as the Captaine Baſtard of the houſe of Haurion, very ancient in that Countrie, beſought a Parley, and obtained pardon: ſo as if hee had no ſuccour within three dayes, hee ſhould yeelde vp the place, (life and goods ſaued) the artillerie and other munitions there reſerued, and his ſonne in hoſtage. The three dayes being expired, he departed with his Liegers, the Marſhal confeſſing that he had vndertaken this conqueſt at an aduenture. Likewiſe the Captaine had his hed afterwardes ſtrooke of, for his ſo good ſeruice, Bouillon was yeelded vp the very laſt day of thirtie yeares that the Duchie had beene out of the handes of the right heires, and afterwardes the Marſhall eaſilye recouered all the appendances, and hauing lefte there Des Auelles with a good Garriſon, hee returned to thank the King for this ſo great a benefite: vpon this the army drawing towardes Cinets, and de Lumes being dead, the Caſtle of Lumes was deliuered vp to Vielle-uille, Lieutenant to the Marſhall S. Andre by Merembarque, who kept the ſame for the imperials, the fortes whereof were vndermined and throwne downe, no more remaining but the dungeon, which the King gaue with parte of the confiſcation of this rebellious vaſſale to the D. of Neuers, and Earle of Retel, and the reſt to De Conflant a French gentleman, who had married the Neece true heire of the Lord, the Caſtle is at the foote of a Mountaine, where the riuer of Meuſe runneth by it, and on the other ſide a faire Medowe, halfe a league from Mezieres, to which it had doone many ſhrewde turnes, becauſe the Lord pretended certaine rightes, beſides that it was a retraite to all lewde perſons, an occaſion that Frauncis the firſt had there builded a blockhouſe, which for all that ſerued to no purpoſe by meanes of the euil gouernement thereof. The Lord of which had beene brought vp a Page in the Kinges houſe, and euer held the French partie, vntill that vpon ſome ſpite he changed for the Bourgonion croſſe, with which he dyed of the ſhiuer of a peece which hee tryed: afterwards the King

being determined of his returne, and hauing made the D. of Niuernois Gouernour of Luxembourg, all alſo furniſhed Roc de Mars, and the other places with all neceſſaries, notwithſtanding the daily roades of Theonuille, and other imperial places, ſent his armye to batter, take, and cut in peeces; all thoſe that were retired into the Caſtle of Trelon,Cimetz battered, taken, ſacked, and burned by the French. which was vndermined and raiſed, as Glaion and other places: and to content the olde Enſignes, the ſacke of Cimetz was beſtowed on them, a Towne and Caſtle of the Duke of Aſcottes, whither many of the Countrie and of Ardennes were retired, with cheefeſt goods of valewe: but ſeeing the batterye, they cleane lefte the towne, and ranne into the Caſtle, the great Tower whereof was no ſooner battered downe; but thoſe that were beſieged being willing to parley, were knocked downe by the Portail and other places, where they found an entrance to ſacke and rifle, with ſo great greedines and indiſcretion, as within one of the towre vautes where the Powder lay, were aboue ſixe ſcore Souldiars roaſted, by meanes of the fire which the kindled matches of ſome of the Harquebuſiers put thereto. After the Towne and Caſtle was conſumed to aſhes, which greatly aſtonied the Bourguinions and other the borderers, which already feared the ſiege of Auanes, whether the King had indeede cauſed his armye to marche, had it not beene for the ſickenes which day by day encreaſed among the Souldiers, of whome a good parte were alreadye ſecretly ſtolne away, ſome charged with good booties, ſome with ſickneſſe, ſome with tedious and long paines, and many with blowes more then riches, hard to be endured in warre, although but ſoddaine and of ſmall continuance, euen of the moſt hazardous. An occaſion that in the end of Iuly, the armye was parted into Garriſons, attending what the Emperour now would vndertake: who much troubled with the Proteſtant Princes army of Germany, ſaw him ſelfe then brought as it were into two extremeties: either to accorde almoſt whatſoeuer Maurice and his cōpanions would demaund, as well for Religion, as the libertye of Germanye, and ſo to enter into Fraunce, and reuenge ſuch iniuries as he had receiued by King Henry, or elſe to let him alone at his eaſe to gaine the Countrie, whereby he might another time enforce the Germanes to ſubmitte themſelues to the yoke of his power: notwithſtanding whether it were that an iniurye receiued from an equall, ſeemed vnto him more hard to be abidden, then the offence of an inferiour; and one eſpecially bound with a kinde of dutie of ſubiection, or whether hee thought himſelfe in better readines againſt the French, or whether (as ſome ſay) that his hatred conceaued againſt King Henry, did more paſsionate him, then againſt any other Prince; the Emperour reſolued himſelfe of a peace with Germany, as it were to eſpouſe a warre with Fraunce, by ſuch meanes as I will deliuer vnto you.
            
               The principall demaunds of Maurice.
               Maurice ſtood principally vpon two pointes, beſides the deliuerye of the Landgraue; the one, that Ferdinand with Maximilian his Sonne, and the commiſsioners, might from thence take notice of ſuch matters as were hurtefull to the libertye of Germanye, and iudge thereof according to the ancient cuſtome of Germanye: the other, that Religion ſhould be let alone in peace, and no harme in reſpect thereof to any man in the Worlde, vntill the difference might be decided. The Commiſſioners allowed of this forme, but the Emperour ſhewed what hee deſired and iudged fitte, how it was reaſonable that ſuch as had euer remained loyall towards him, and thereby greatly fallen into calamities; might receiue recompence for their loſſes. After long debating and ſome articles eaſed, it was concluded that the Emperour ſhould giue his full anſwere by the third of Iulye, and that in the meane time there ſhould bee a

truce and ceſſation of armes: The Commiſſioners then ſent their letters to the Emperour the 26. of Iune, to exhorte him to a peace. Afterwards the French Embaſſadour being preſſed to deliuer the occaſions of his Maiſters diſcontentment, and vnder what conditions he would enter into a peace: hauing receaued newes from his Maſter, anſwered, that the King had not vndertaken this warre in reſpect of his own particular, but to ſuccour Germany ſo farre going to decay:The French Embaſſadours anſwere to the Commiſsiones for peace. as touching the conditions of peace, it was not the cuſtome of the Kings of Fraunce to demaund it as became themſelues in all reſpects: therefore he did not thinke he had any cauſe to propoſe ought, without an aſſured hope of obtaining the ſame: eſpeciallye conſidering that the Emperour had moſt vniuſtly made warre againſt him, while he marched for their ſuccours; notwithſtanding he would quit much for a peace, ſo as he might ſee it generall, and refuſed not but that they might take knowledge, and determine of theſe differents, to which if Charles would not doe reaſon, he proteſted the fault ſhuld onely light of his necke, for all the miſeries which might enſue thereon.
            In ſumme, that theſe Princes perceiuing the delaies of the Emperour,Peace throughout Germany, and the occaſions thereof. had no ſooner beſieged Francforte, where was a great Garriſon of the Emperours, but by the aduiſe of the moſt parte of the Princes of Germanye, the peace was concluded the laſt of Iulye 1552. See the occaſions which draue the one and the other to conclude the ſame. Among other reaſons the great danger was laide before Maurice, which he ſhould ſtand in, as well on the Emperours ſide which had alreadye prepared a great armie, as of his Coſins behalfe Iean Frederic, whom the Emperour meant to ſend home free into his Countrie. The Emperour likewiſe ſtoode in feare of the force of the Germanes and of the French. The Landgraues ſonne for the long detention of his Father. Among other articles the Captiue Princes were to be ſet at libertie, no diſquiet for their Religion, which they would aduiſe of at the firſt aſſembly; within ſixe moneths the King of Fraunce was to declare vnto Maurice his demaunds: Albert was comprehended therein if he layde downe armes. The King miſliked with the whole courſe, yet hee ſent back the Hoſtages, and Maurice his: to wit, the Earle of Nanteuil, and Iametz.
         
         
            
            The Hiſtorie of Fraunce.
            THE SECOND BOOKE.
            
               YOu haue heere before ſeene what preparatiues the Emperour, and the Catholicke Princes confederate for Religion, made of all partes, againſt the Proteſtant Princes, to furniſh the great armye that they might be able, to the end they might range them at deuotion. The Germanes notwithſtanding had the partie and were ſo well ſuccoured, as at the laſt the Emperour accorded parte of their demaunds at Pauſsau, in the ende of Iuly, vppon conditions ouer and aboue before rehearſed, that Maurice ſhould carrie ſuch people as he had to the ſuccour of Ferdinand King of Romanes, againſt the Turkes come downe into Tranſiluania. Afterwardes the Emperour extreamelye fretting at ſuch loſſes as King Henry had cauſed him to receaue, fearing worſe,The Emperour perſwadeth the Proteſtant princes and other, to ſuccour him againſt the K. of Fraunce, for the recouerye of Metz, Thoul, and Verdun. and maruelouſly affected to a reuenge, practiſed by all meanes poſſible, to perſwade the Chriſtian Princes, and aboue all the Germanes, to ſuccour him againſt the King, whome he endeuoured to render, a no leſſe enemy to the Empire, then to his owne particular: hee preuailed at laſt ſo farre by the dexterity of his owne wit, that the reſt of the Princes and imperiall citties as well of the aſſociation as other, were by little and little gained to furniſh him with men, monie, and artillerie; cheefelye in reſpect that hee proteſted that hee would not imploye any parte thereof to his owne particular, but onely to the recouering of Metz; Thoul, and Verdun, three free Citties, and holding of the Empire, which the King of Fraunce (ſaid he with a diſcourſe very ſtout and full of great perſwaſions) had withdrawne from the Empire of the Germanes, vnder colour of comming to aide them for the maintenance of their Religion &amp; libertie, which ſaid he is not to be preſumed for many reaſons, but principally for the diuerſitie of the religion, whereof he hath alwaies made profeſsion, and by the effect which enſued thereon: hauing ſo much diſmembred the Germane Empire, which he had more annoied, had hee beene permitted to haue paſſed the Rhin, and entred into the Countrie full of garboyles and factions of all partes, whereof he full well knew how to make his profite; for his owne parte hee promiſed, that hee would employ therein all his forces and meanes, to repaire ſo great an iniury: therefore he haſtned the olde Spaniſh and Italian bands, which he cauſed to come out of Italye, both by Sea and land; which being ioyned to the troupes of Lombardy and Piemont, trauerſed the Alpes, to repaire to the reſt of the armie, which was aſſembled

in Germany, as well of Bohemians, Hungarians, Pollaques, Germanes, Hannuyers, Wallons, Cleuois, Flemings, Burgonions, as other, whereof he furniſhed the number of fiftie thouſand Fantaſsins, and twenty thouſand horſe, with great prouiſion both of groſſe and ſmall artillerye. Now for as much as Albert of Brandebourg would not agree to the conditions of peace concluded at Pauſsau,The Emperours army againſt the K. of France, for the recouery of Metz, Thoul, and Verdun. and for not laying downe his armes, he ſtoode as baniſhed the Empire, hee aſſembled a troupe of men as malcontent as himſelfe, who diſuniting themſelues from the former confederacie, continued warre againſt ſuch townes as refuſed to ſuccour the league againſt th'emperour, as Nuremberg, out of which he receiued a great ſumme of monie; afterwards beſieged Vlme, enforced the Biſhops of Bamberg, &amp; Wiſsembourg, to very ſtrange conditions; entred into Wormes, Spire, Mayence, Treuues, and ſundry other places, whence he receaued great treaſure, ſo as making warre apart, and yet as vnder the name and pretence of the K. of France, whoſe armes they bare in their ancients, and cornets, he made himſelf more renowned for his rigours, and extream cruelties, thē for any other feats of war, notwithſtanding being followed with 2000. horſe, 8000. pietons, &amp; certain peeces which he trained to make him open paſſage, and enforce any places of reſiſtance, in the end he came as low as Treues, which he ranſackt; and as he paſſed forwards towards Fraunce, the King in whoſe name he made the warre,Albert of Brandebourg why not comprehended in the peace, and baniſhed the Empire, with the exploites of his malcontent armie. and cauſed ſuch places as he tooke, to take their oath, ſent vnto him Iohn da Freſne B. of Bayonne, altogether freſhly returned out of Germany, to vnderſtand his intent, and agree with him touching his owne paye, and ſuch of his people as would continue their courſe of liuing vnder the title and pretence of the ſeruice of France, endemnifying the enemies as much as might be, and chiefely vpon the frontiers of Luxembourg. His firſt anſwere was very honeſt and gratious, ſaying that as touching his owne appointment, he was not come to the K. ſeruice for a particular profit or hope to enrich himſelfe thereby, but that all his life long he had euer a deſire to employe his perſon and meanes, to do vnto him all humble ſeruice, conſidering the good zeale of his Maieſtie, in hauing ſo well maintained the franchiſies and liberties of Germany, the very occaſion why he was ſeperated from D. Maurice, eſteeming the King ſo reaſonable, as that he would giue an appointment equall to the merits of his Souldiers, men of choice, and ready to dye for his ſeruice; with many other gratious ſpeeches. But the King and his councel had a further reach into the matter,The anſwere of Marqueſſe Albert to the B. of Bayonne, and his behauiour againſt the K. and Emperour, and their reciprocallie towards him. and as he miſtruſted leaſt the Emperour went about to practiſe him, certaine particulars happened, ſoon enough to make him apparantly to iudge how his attonement was already in good tearmes, the concluſion whereof the Emperor had notwithſtanding euer delayed, hoping to preuent him, and vnder colour thereof ſo to ſhut him in, and encloſe him ſo neere with his army, which he had in the fielde, that he would haue him vpon what cōdition himſelfe beſt liked: the which the Marqueſſe had no leſſe doubt of, ſetting before his owne eyes ſuch entertainment as his kinſemen and allies had before receiued: an occaſion that he euer ſought to gaine the forewardes, reſolued that if hee were euer able to ioyne on the Frontiers of Fraunce, he ſhould reſt aſſured, and be well appointed by the King, and that the Emperour would be moſt glad to agree to whatſoeuer he would demaund. Some councelled him to reſt vpon the Kings offers, other to follow his fortune from higher of his owne Countrie, vpon theſe plats and ſecret inductions, he notwithſtanding paſſed further, mounting towards the riuer of Mozelle, and coaſting of Theonuille, he came to encampe at Roranges, three leagues from Metz, where as ſoone as he was arriued, he ſent to demaund victuals of the Duke of Guiſe (whom the King had already apointed Gouernour at Metz, as

In ſumme, that he ſo hardly preſſed him and ſo often, that hee was conſtrained to declare vnto him by Pierre Stroſsi, how the reaſon of the warre which hee was not ignorant of, permitted not that one ſhould disfurniſh a place of guarde, (chiefely of ſuch importance of Metz) of victuals and prouiſions whereof it ſhould be furniſhed, to diſtribute them to a Campe, which might be maſter of the field, and follow any other way or Country, as towards Sallines, a moſt fertile Countrie, wherin he ſhould not onely finde all commodities: but in eating and conſuming thereof, he ſhould the more diſaduantage the enemye, in not being able to recouer the like there. At which ſeeming to content himſelfe, he demanded ſome guide, which knew the Country, and might conduct him and lead him thither: whereto was ordained by the Duke of Guiſe, and expreſſely ſent from Metz, one Gaſpard de Hus, a natiue Gentleman of Metz: notwithſtanding in very ſhort ſpace he changed his minde, for inſteed of taking the waye towardes Sallines, hee came the more neerer within one legue to Metz, and encamped in a place called Aey, where he made ſome ſtay, vſing all the ſcales which he could imagine, for vnder colour to gaine the good grace of the Emperour by ſome remarqueable ſeruice, entiſing the Duke of Guiſe to giue him ſome trauerſes, or to trouble him by ſome diſorder, had not the Prudence of that Prince bene ſo great as to foreſee and remedy the ſame. Then hauing by diuers remoues trauerſed all that Countrie; and being turned towards Treues, to fetche there a number of Souldiers which he had left there, he came downe to Pont Camouſon, neuer hauing for al that reſolued any thing with the B. of Bayonne, either of his own appointment, or pay of his people: albeit that the King had againe ſent back Lonſac vnto him for the very ſame cauſe; notwithſtanding he could conclude vpon nothing with him, training alwaies the effect in diuerſitie of demaundes, coloured with faire wordes, whereon it was a very vneaſie matter to laye any foundation, and therefore they entred into the greater ſuſpition of him, ſo as the firſt miſtruſt began to encreaſe more then before: wherefore with as much ſpeed as might be the King who hauing knowne the Emperours intents and preparatiues, had alreadye cauſed all his Garriſons, bandes and arriere bandes, and other new companies, to repaire vnto Champagne, made his Campe to aſſemble at S. Michel, a little towne of Lorraine, vpon the riuer of Meuſe,The French armie aſſembled with all diligēce at S. Michael, a little towne of Lorraine. ſixe leagues on the ſide of Pont Camouſon, as farre from Verdun, and ten long ones from Metz, whether likewiſe repaired the Conſtable, the D. of Neuers, the Earle of Anguien, the Prince of Conde, the Earle of Aumale, the Vice-count of Rohan, the Marſhall S. Andre, Chaſtillon generall of the French Fanterie, the Earle of Villars, Bourdillon then ordained Marſhall of the Campe, the Earle Reingraue, and Reiroc, with their Regimentes of Lanſquenets, and ſundrye other great Lords and Captains.
            
               The imperiall army at Deuxponts ſcattered ouer the Country of Vaulges.As touching the Imperiall armie, it was altogether readie, and grew great by view of the eye, hauing ſo farre already marched, as being arriued at Deuxponts, it extended it ſelfe throughout all the Countrie of Vaulges, in ſorte that it was very requiſite

to lodge, and cauſe to enter into Metz all ſuch ſuccours, as well of men, of artillerie, and other munition, as had beene determined to be ſent thether, and therefore the moſt commodiouſly that hee was able,The Marques Alberts armie verie diſſolute about Pont Camouſon. the Conſtable ſent from Saint Michael the companies of horſe and foote which were ordained to this purpoſe vnder the charge and conduct of Horace Farneze Duke of Caſtres, carrying with him a number of pioners, and ſtore of pouder, for the better ſtrengthning of the towne, though not in ſo great quantitie, for all that, as the Conſtable could haue wiſhed, and as hee had done, without the feare he had of the Marqueſſe, who was alwayes at Pont Camouſon, his men being ouer the plaine Country round about, giuen to all inſolencies of warre, pilling, &amp; leauing not ought but what they made no account of, or could not carrie or beare away. The which was found very ſtrange, and greatly augmented the diſtruſt which might be had of him. Notwithſtanding to bring him to ſome reaſon, they ſent vnto him the Duke of Aumalle, de Chaſtillon, and the Earle of Reingraue,The laſt anſwers or reſolution of the marques to the French, and the behauiour of his armie. to praye him to cauſe his people to leaue of their waſting and ſpoiling of the Countrie: and finally to reſolue with him the laſt accord of his appointment and paye of men. Then they ſoone inough diſcouered what had bin before conceiued of him but as it were in a cloud, rendering ſo ambiguous &amp; haughtie an anſwere, with a ſpitefull and malecontent ieſture, that he demanded almoſt the moitie of a kings ranſome for appointment. And as touching the order of his mens liuing, hee ſhewed that he had alreadie ſetled his affaires, anſwering in the end with an aſſured reſolution, that he was a friend to the king, and an allie to the houſe of Lorrain, but hee meant that his ſouldiers ſhould haue wherewithall to liue, and take it where they could find it, in caſe of refuſall, he was reſolued what he had to do, and whether to retire himſelfe: yea, ſo far, as refuſing to receiue ſuch monie as the Conſtable had ſent vnto him. Whereby they well perceiued how he was reconciled to the Emperor, by the practiſe of ſome. Who perceiuing that he was out of his reach for doing him any harme, and that he had himſelfe great need of people, pardoned him all his faults, and forbad that any ſhould make his proceſſe in reſpect of the war paſſed: ratified the contracts made with the B. of Bamberg and Wicibourg, releaſed him of going to the war in Hungary, yea, ſo farre as to agree with him the more, he pardoned the Earles of Itigen, both father and ſon, &amp; Albert de Mansfeld and his children. Now the Emperor lying ſicke of his gouts, and as well for this cauſe, as for the importunitie of the time, his armie ſoiourning in the countye of Vaulges, with as great dilligence as was poſſible, they placed againe the French army at S. Michel, ſtrengthned it as well with the French Fanterie, Germans &amp; Zuizers, to the number neere hand of 30000. footmen, and betweene ſeuen and eight thouſand horſe: wherefore the French began to hope better than euer, ſo as the aduiſe of ſome was to charge vpon the Marques whileſt that the greater armie of the enemie was ſo far of, the meanes were the gallantnes of the French armie, the diſcontentment of the Marqueſſes people, not able beſides to make anie retrait into anie place, wherein they ſhould not be purſued as enemies for their inſolencies paſſed, preſent, &amp; to come. Other preuailed in councell, which perſwaded that it would be better to goe more couertly to worke, and vnderhand to withdraw the better part of his captains &amp; ſouldiers, by meanes of ſuch Germanes as were alreadie come to the kings ſeruice, with aſſurance of redie paie &amp; good intertainment to come. Which was ſo wel handled,Colonel Reif-berg with a regiment of the marques Alberts, retireth himſelf to the kings ſeruic

                that with a great mutiny hapned between themſelues, the colonell Reif-berg with his regiment, accepted from thence forward of the French party. Wherat the marques being extreamly deſpited, and ſeeing otherwiſe how the armie of France, which euerie day was mightily increaſed, grew neere neighbor vnto him: how alredie men murmured

agaynſt him, and how his ſouldiers mutined among themſelues, whereof many both couertly and in ſight were retired to the French, and how through all theſe accidents he was in danger to be ſurpriſed and incloſed,The Marques demandeth paſport to returne. hee certefied the Conſtable, howe that ſince it pleaſed not the King to entertaine him into his ſeruice, not willing to accorde vnto him reaſonable appoyntment and paie, his requeſt was to haue a ſafe conduct to depart, proteſting that in other places of his enemies Countrie, he was able to doo vnto him as good or better ſeruice as there, and could conquere landes, which might perpetually remaine vnto him without ſticking at a trifle: aſſuring him notwithſtanding vpon his faith, neuer to take parte wyth the Emperour agaynſt him. The King beeing aduertiſed heereof, and the matter thoroughly debated of in Councell, grew of opinion howe it was much more expedient, to make a bridge to a mans enemie, ſeeking to retire, than to put armes into the furnace to heate him anie more, as well to aſſure the people of the violent comming of the man, ſeeking nought but his owne aduenture wythout reſpect of his lyfe, as alſo honeſtly to conuoie and conduct him, for in beeing willing to fight with him by ſtrong hande, albeit that fortune were fauourable, yet coulde not the victorie remayne but wyth great loſſe, peraduenture of many braue men, whereof the King as then ſtoode in great neede, a farre greater enemie beeing at hande than the other,The D. of Aumal appointed to accompanie the Marques. as alſo to the ende it might not bee reproached vnto him to haue defeated one which came to his ſuccours, eſpecially a Germane, one of the moſt auncient friendes and confederates of the French. To this end was the Biſhoppe of Bayonne lefte neere about him for his better ſuretie and conduct, to cauſe him to haue a ſafe and free paſſage thoroughout all the Kinges Countries. Of the other parte the Duke of Aumalle was appoynted to accompanie him with two hundred men at armes, and fiue hundred light horſe, to hinder anie of his men from ſpoyling or ruining anie of the kings ſubiects. For during the three weekes that Albert made his abode neere de Thoul vppon Mozelle, they vnderſtood of ſo ſtraunge diſorder, and moſt exceſsiue exceſſes, which his people dyd as well to the Nobles, as peſants and church men, that in the ende perceiuing howe the Duke of Aumalle, to whome they addreſſed themſelues, tolde them that hee was not able to haue anie other reaſon at his handes, albeit hee had certefied him thereof, they aſſembled themſelues to kil and truſſe vp as many as they were able. Whereof he greatly complained to the Duke, who aunſwered him that hee woulde haue regarde to his duetie, leauing him the paſſage free, but hee had gone agaynſt his worde in permitting ſo great an inſolencie. Conſtrayned in the ende to diſplace, hee went and incamped neere vnto a poole vppon a mariſh, where in the night it rayned ſo harde, as hee thought hee ſhoulde neuer haue founde meanes to eſcape thence, eſpeciallye his Artillerie ſticking faſt in the myre, and bemoyled euen to the verie axiltree and truckes of the carriages, where the Duke of Aumalle had fayre meanes to haue cleane ruyned him, wythout the loſſe of anie one man, had hee beene ſo diſpoſed to haue done.
            
               Aduice &amp; counſell among the Emperors Captaines, if they ought to beſiege Metz at that time of the yere.October was now well ſpent, when the imperiall armie as yet remained in the Countrie of Vaulges, and towardes Deuxponts, the Emperour ſtill continuing very ill diſpoſed, as alſo for that hee attended ſuccours out of the Low Countries, which were not as yet arriued, and his artillerie and munition which hee cauſed to bee brought downe the Rhine as farre as Confluence, from thence the eaſier all along the riuer of Moſelle, to make it bee landed almoſt harde by Metz. And for that the ſharpeſt coldes of the winter beginne in this ſeaſon, ſuch a delaie cauſed a number of perſons to bee of opinion, that the Emperour woulde not ſo late vndertake

a ſiege of ſo great conſequence, and that he would not expoſe ſo fayre and well compleat an armie, to thinke to vanquiſh both the rigor of the time, and a Towne ſo well prouided, as all the Captaines imagined: who councelled him rather to aſſaie the recouerie of the reſt of the townes, as wel of the Dutchie of Lorraine, as of Barois and Luxenbourg, in which hee might well cauſe his armie to winter, and keepe it couered from the euill ſeaſon, in which meane time they of Metz ſhoulde bee conſtrayned to ſpend theyr victuals, and conſume their munitions, beeing continually notwithſtanding held in ſubiection by ſuch roads as the ſouldiers ſhould dayly make vppon them, and the Countrie about more and more to affeeble them, and cleane take awaie all meanes from them to recouer victualles; whereof towardes the ſpring they woulde ſtande in ſo great neceſsitie, as they might then eaſily ſet vppon them to their greater aduantage. Shewing further, how that before he cold wel diſpoſe and appoint the ſiege of this ſo great a towne, and that his artillerie could be planted and prepared for the batterie, winter would ſo hardly bee come on, that it woulde be a cauſe of interrupting all his meanes, as well by reaſon of ſnowes, windes, raines, and extreame froſts, cauſing a great number of his ſouldiers to die, as through the difficultie which they ſhould haue to recouer victualls, beeing detayned and ſtayed backe by the conſtraint and indiſpoſition of the time, as alſo in hauing them oftentimes bee met with, and taken awaie by the French. Beſides all that, together with the loſſe that myght fortune him to receiue there, ſuch and ſo great a ſhame, as hee would rather wiſh it had coſt him the crowne of his Empire, ſo as hee had not beene at all there. For after hauing combatted, and beene in part defeated by the furie and violence of the time, he ſhould finde beſides another enemie ſtrong and puiſſant, which attended but onely an occaſion to ruine him for euer. This aduice though it were the moſt certayne for the Emperours ſecuritie, yet could it not by anie meanes bee receiued of him, for his ſpirite beeing pricked forward and ſolicited by an extreame deſire of beeing reuenged, forgot all accidents and perils, to bee happily reſolued in the end of one onely point, whereby hee might knowe but how to bee reuenged of the King. And among others it ſeemed beſt vnto him, firſt to addreſſe himſelfe to the towne of Metz, within which hee well knew were many of the principall Princes and great Lords of France: and that beſides, it was perfectly furniſhed and prouided with great ſtore of munition. Wherfore it ſeemed vnto him, that if by the ſurplus of the reſt of that yere, hee could worke ſo wel, as to be able only to recouer it, hee might eaſily by meanes of ſuch priſoners as he ſhould find therein, obtaine and get againe at the kings hands whatſoeuer he had taken from him, perſwading himſelfe that he would help himſelf with the French mens owne roddes and preparatiues to conſtraine them therto, and that being come once to the top, and hauing ſubdued this firſt and principall fortres, wherein was the verie flower of the French ſouldiers, hee eaſily promiſed to himſelfe the compaſsing of his leſſer enterpriſes. So as in the end the Emperour marched with his armie towardes the riuer of Moielle, neuer following for all that the right waie, as if hee had meant to deſcend towards Theonuille, and the Dutchie of Luxembourg. Whereof the Duke of Guiſe beeing aduertiſed, not willing to looſe or leaue in praye one of the olde Enſignes of Captaine La Prade, which was within Roc de Mars, tooke ſo good order; as in the ſight of his enemies, the rather by the meanes of a skirmiſh which the Duke of Nemours, and the Earle of La Roche-foucaut made before Theonuille, the Enſigne hauing ſet all the Caſtle on fire, was retyred and ſaued, together wyth the better part of the Artillerie which was therein.
            
               The Conſtable in the meane time who ſtill remained at S. Michel to ſee and know what courſe the Emperour ment to take, hauing intelligence how the imperiall armye marched, holding on that way, doubting the euent of ſundrye thinges, among other, leaſt leauing of Metz, it might addreſſe it ſelfe to Verdun, which was not ſtrong enough, nor almoſt of any reaſonable defence, or to ſome feeble towne or vnprouided, cauſed the French armie in like ſorte to march, and approched nere vnto Verdun, in which as then the Marſhall S. Andre remained Lieutenant for the King, with his company of one hundred men at armes, and Tauannes which was gouernor with his company of fiftie men at armes, and eight Enſignes of French Fanterie, of the legion of Champagne, two companies of light horſe, and as many Harquebuſiers on horſeback, who without ceaſing either day or night, cauſed them to trauaile about the fortification, repleniſhing otherwiſe this great Towne, with corne, wines, and all other ſortes of victuals, which they could finde round about. As much did Rabaudanges Gouernour of D'Anuille, and De Blaneau then Gouernour of Yuoy, and the Captain Baron Gouernour of Mommedy, ſtriuing as it were with a kinde of enuye, and forcing themſelues who ſhould beſt better his place; for albeit that they were already ſtrong and well appointed, yet did they continually watch to aduaunce thereto whatſoeuer they might preſume to be wanting therin. Now there reſted no more but the towne of Satenay, by corrupt ſpeech called Aſtenay: which the Imperials being already in the field, men doubted might be firſt aſſaulted and taken on the ſuddain, vnprouided of euery thing, as indeed it was: albeit that before time the late King Francis had cauſed it to be repaired and fortified, to ſerue him for ſome ſhadow or colour, againſt thē of the duchie of Luxembourg: ſince notwithſtanding the euill ſcituation thereof hauing bene declared vnto him, and how much more hurtefull it would grow vnto him, if after hauing fortified it, it ſhould happen to fall into the enemies hand, he cauſed the fortes and bulwarkes in many places to be caſt down and raced, and the flankers and defences to be ruined; putting it againe in this ſorte to the domanie of the Duke of Lorraine, ſometime after notwithſtanding the King hauing again recouered it, and thruſt out the Bourgonians which had ſeaſed therof, and began to repaire it as you haue ſeene, to aide themſelues againſt him, euer ſince helde it in his owne handes, without adding for all that any new fortification, but onelye to hinder that it ſhould not be hurtfull vnto himſelfe. Heereupon afterwardes hauing bene ſhewed vnto him by the D. of Neuers, how it might be made ſtrong &amp; defenſable, and that himſelfe without any danger would vndertake to keep it, he commanded that all means and deuiſes ſhould be ſought out to fortifie it with al diligence: to which this Prince voluntarily rendred himſelfe ſo ſubiect, that any great labour ſeemed to him but a pleaſure, for the perfecting of his work, which he had in ſo great recōmendation, that much and the principal part therof was found wel forward before euer it was imagined that the foūdations were as yet laid; &amp; not only that, but hauing intelligence how in a little town named Vireton within 5. leagues of Satenay, there were a number of theeues &amp; banniſhed perſons aſſembled, liuing vpon nothing but theft &amp; ſpoiles, which they made about the country, forſeeing further that if the ſiege ſhuld fortune to come before Satenay, that this receptackle of brigands would ſerue very fitly to his enemies,Vireton ſurpriſed and beſieged through the ſecret and great diligence of the D. of Neuers. to retire thither their victual, munitions &amp; other neceſſaries, hee ſurpriſed them ſo fortunately, as in a morning before that euer they could haue thought him awake, hauing no means to ſaue thēſelues, or to haue reskew from their partners, they ſawe themſelues encloſed and enwrapped by this Prince, accompanyed with ten Enſignes of French Fanterie: to wit, two of Verdun, two of D'anuille, 2.

of Yuoy, two of Mommedy, and two of Satenay; of Caualerie of the companies of the Duke of Bouillon, of Iametz, and of La Roche du Maine, of light horſe and Harquebuſiers on horſeback, of Captaine Sapoigne, and ſundrye Gentlemen of his owne houſe, ſo as being arriued before this towne in this ſorte, to the end readilye to execute his determination, he cauſed it to be battered as ſoddenly as might be, without giuing any leaſure at all to make any trench, or dreſſe any baskets of earth, but the artillery being onely couered with Cartes, Tables, dores, Waggons, and ſuch geare, as at that inſtant they were able to finde to put before it, he ſo planted it and cunningly trauerſed it to the marke, that the wall was greatlye ſhaken;, and a very reaſonable breach made; the which they within endured without any ſemblance at all of feare, or willingnes to yeelde themſelues. The French Souldiers ſeeing the gappe, had ſo burning a deſire to goe to the aſſault, as being impatient of temporiſing, and without tarrying for the Generals commaundement La Cheſne Enſigne to Captaine La Land, followed with ſome number of Souldiers, ranne haſtelye into the ditche with his head forwards, to thruſt right into the breach, who notwithſtanding was valiantlye put back by the Bourgonions, and ſore hurt, whereof afterwardes hee died. Arbelay likewiſe the Enſigne of Captain Baron was there ſlaine, and many valiant Souldiers. In the end they within beſieged, ſeeing the reſt of the preparations, and not finding themſelues prouided, nor ſtrong enough to ſuſtaine a generall aſſaulte, made a ſigne of being deſirous to parley, requiring that ſome reſpit might be giuen vnto thē within, who if they had not readily ſuccours, promiſed to yeelde themſelues, their liues and goods ſaued. The Duke of Neuers would by no meanes accord vnto them one onely howre of delay, but anſwered that if they did not yeelde themſelues at the inſtant vnto his diſcretion, their liues ſaued,Vireton rendred vp to the diſcretion and mercy of the D. of Neuers. he would cauſe them al to paſſe by the edge of the ſword; ſo as hauing a while conſidered of the danger, they yeelded themſelues to the mercy and diſcretion of the Duke, which happened in very good time, for there remained no more but two bullets of a Culuerin left: they being gone out, to the end no leaſure ſhould be giuen to the French ſouldiers to amuſe about the ſpoile, fire was put in diuers places of the Towne: as for the Priſonners the Duke of Neuers had alreadye giuen them leaue to departe, when as they were as well known vnto the Captaine Sapoigne their neighbour, Sonne to Gilles de Leuant ſometimes gouernour of Luxembourg, againſt whom Sapoigne declared vnto the Duke, that the honeſteſt man among them all had one hundred times deſerued death, and how hee ſhould ſhew them too much fauour to ſaue their liues, for if he ſhould ſet thē at liberty, it would be a means to make them do more harme to the French: Therefore the greateſt part of them were retained and carried priſonners to Satenaye, afterwardes ſome were ſent backe, the principall being reſerued, cheefely the Captain Dalumont otherwiſe Malladerie, and his enſigne named Arbonniere: all theſe matters being thus happely atchieued in one onely day, the armie returned the ſame very night to lodge at Satenay with all the companies, except thoſe of Mommedy, who in reſpect they were neere hand retired as then from the place, cōmandement being giuen, that they ſhould dayly repaire thither by hundreds, to make euen with the ground the reſt of Vireton, which the fire was not able to waſte or conſume, and on the next morrowe hauing diſpatched S. Simon to carry newes vnto the K. who continually remained at Reims, and cōmanded Deſpotz Gouernour of Satenay, to receaue of the inhabitants within the town, the oath of fidelity in the K. name, he dparted towards the cōſtable, who cauſed the armye to temporiſe, attending what the Emperour would attempt;

who finding all his forces aſſembled, and the ſuccours which he attended out of the low Countries being arriued, took the high way againe towards Metz, and was approched as farre as Sarabuc,The Imperial armie approcheth within 7. or 8 leagues of Metz. ſeuen leagues from thence: and a few dayes after the D. of Alua, Lieutenant generall of the Emperour, and the Marqueſſe of Marignan Colonell of the Italian Fantaſsins, with fourteene thouſand foote, foure thouſand horſe, and ſixe fielde peeces, approched ſo neere as to diſcouer the Towne, and the fitteſt places for to pitch their Campe in, which was not doone without a furious and braue skirmiſh of the French ſouldiars,The D. of Alua and Marqueſſe of Marignan came to deſcry Metz. who being ſallied forth, for a beginning made them well to perceiue and feele with what affection they were determined to defend themſelues, and maintaine the place, wherein the French as then atchiued great reputation as well of the Duke of Guiſe as of their enemies: who afterwardes retired themſelues to S. Barbe, two leagues back, with ſmall aduauntage, and loſſe of neere hand eight or nine ſcore men, and of French men there was loſt Marigny Picard, iſſued out of the auncient and moſt renowmed houſe of Salezart, and fiue Souldiers which were ſlaine on the place, Sylly Mompha and the Captaine La Vaure, dyed there of their wounds.
            
               The D. of Aumales aduertiſemēt to the K. vpon the determination of the Marqueſſe of Brandebourg.In the meane time the D, of Aumalle ſtanding well aſſured of all the plattes and ſollicitings which they practiſed with the Marqueſſe Albert, aduertiſed the K. thereof who was at Reims, to the end to prouide of all ſides, as wel on that part as towards Picardie, certifying him that the moſt expedient way was rather to ſet vpon him, thē to ſuffer him to ioyne with the enemy, and ſo to make him the ſtronger, and to bring that to paſſe, he let him to vnderſtand that with ſuch meanes as hee already had two hundred men at armes, would be ſufficient to defeate him. The King made anſwere that hee liked his deuice very well, prouided that it were wiſely executed, and without too much hazard, and preſently hee commaunded Bourdillon to goe and ioyne with him with a hundred men at armes, and obey him wherein ſoeuer for his ſeruice hee would imploye him: whereupon hee came towardes him within three leagues, neere vnto which place, hee readily aduertiſed him how by the Kings commaundement, with all poſsible diligence he had made his repaire towards him, to obey him, beſeeching him to ſignifie his pleaſure, and what he was to doe. The D. of Aumalle anſwered him that he was maruelouſly contented at his ſo great diligence vſed, and that the Marqueſſe hauing already paſſed ouer the riuer of Muze, was ready likewiſe to goe ouer the other of Madon, to retire himſelfe to the Emperours Campe, and he knew not any great means how to follow him any longer: wherfore in breefe he determined to retire himſelfe to Thoul, to make warre againſt the enemie. This anſwere was the cauſe that Bourdillon ſtirred not from Blanieau attending his returne. Three daies after notwithſtanding the D. of Aumalle ſent his Trumpetter with letters to the Marqueſſe, to ſuck alwaies ſome intelligence from him: but ſo it was as finding him at the borough of S. Nicolas, whether he was gone with a ſmall companie to conclude with the Emperours Deputies, making ſmall account of thoſe letters; the Trumpetter was ſtaied, to the end that readily returning hee might not diſcouer the ſecret, nor make reporte of what he had ſeene: who maruelling greatlye at this ſtrange entertainement, went to the Marqueſſes truchman for it was tolde him that hee had beene brought vp in Fraunce,The D. de Aumales trumpeter ſtaied by the Marqueſſe Albert. thinking by that meanes that hee would haue carried ſome good affection to haue pleaſured thoſe of that Nation, whence he had receaued all kinde of curteſie, but contrariwiſe hee found him a braue and preſumptuous Gallant, who iudged himſelfe of the higheſt valour, by reaſon of the familiaritie which he had with his Maſter. The Trumpetter be ſought him to procure

his diſpatch and returne. He contrariwiſe without making any anſwere at al to his requeſt, railed extreamely at the French, and wiſhing vnto them a thouſand curſes, he proteſted with great oaths, that before it were long he would bathe himſelfe in their bloud. So the Trumpetter was enforced to tarrie vntill the Thurſday before the day wherein the defeate ſhould be accompliſhed, as they tolde him and how that the morrowe after he ſhould returne with his anſwere: which came not to paſſe for all that: for that day all things being changed to the worſe, the Trumpeter was more rigorouſly entreated then before, led, bound faſt, wrong hard, and trained, as if how-erlye hee expected nought elſe then to be hanged or dye miſerably. Thus the Marqueſſe had determined the next morrowe to take his way to the Emperours Camp, and there reſted nothing but to vnite and appeaſe ſome of his Captains &amp; Souldiers, who had no great minde to turne their face to take oath to the Emperor, in reſpect of the euill entertainment which they had found both at his hands and the Spaniards, in the wars paſſed. The 28. of October the D.D'aumalle being enformed of this departure, diſlodged at the break of day, with al his Caualerie from the Port of S. Vincent, where he lay, and put himſelfe in battell vpon the toppe of an high mountaine called La Croiz du Montier, aboue the Marqueſſe, to conſider well and viewe what he would doe, and what courſe he would take; who in like ſorte ordered his battailes to follow his intended way, without hauing any opinion at that daye to fight with the French: yet theſe two armies were not long time neighbours, but that the skirmiſhes began hottely, as well by the Countrie people as ſome French Souldiers,The couragious perſwaſions of the Marqueſſe to make his people to fight. who were runne thither hoping to robbe and ſpoile ſome bootie at the taile of the Marqueſſe. To whom reporte thereof was made two or three times before hee would beleeue ought, anſwering that the D.D'aumalle did not make ſearch after him. It was about the beginning of Nouember that theſe plaintes redoubling of all partes, himſelfe with his truchman, would needs goe ſee how true indeede it was, where hee was very fiercely repulſed, ſo as with a Harquebuſe ſhot his truchman was ſlaine hard by him, which moued him in ſuch ſorte, as returning to his people, and with liuelye and affectionate praiers and exclamations, hauing declared vnto them,The D. de Aumelle and the French charged vpon fiercely. how the D.D'aumalle with a great number of French Caualerie, attended them in the paſſage to hew them in peeces, and that the leaſt that could befall them was death, which they could by no meanes eſcape without doing ſome notable and great exploite, hee vſed all paines and meanes to encourage them to the Combate, laying down before them in like ſorte, that if they had any doubt of the rigour and puniſhment of the Emperour, they were much leſſe to hope or looke for any better entertainement of the French. All theſe perſwaſions could no whit for all that moue the Fanterie of Albert, who mutining for want of pay, refuſed so goe any further; but well the Caualerie, eſpecially the chieftanes, and aboue all; George of the noble familye of Lichtebergh, who was as in the Proteſtants war his Lieutenant generall: the which fiercely went to charge vpon the companies of the D.D'aumalle, who was vpon the point and determination to retire, albeit that the B. of Bayonne egged him forward to the defeate of the Marqueſſe: but it was ſo late that they were already at hand to ioyne together, and to fight with ſo extreme euill lucke, as at the firſt reencounter they mette with a troupe of ſeruants, who had beene ſet in that place but to make a ſhew;The D. companies put to flight by the Marqueſſe. whome they incontinently put to flight: and by and by charged vpon an other ſquadron of light horſe, and Harquebuſiers on horſeback, the which in like ſorte they diſordered, finding an onnerture without fight to charge vpon the very ranks of the men of warre, which they ſet vppon and cauſed to recoyle with Piſtoll ſhotte, as troupes and companies

euil prouided of Lances to defend themſelues. The D. of Aumalle ſeeing his cauallerie thus broken, and fled on all hands, greatly agreeued, and foreſeeing an vnhappy end to enſue this enterpriſe, willed Breze the Lieutenant of his company to retire, and the beſt way that he might be able to ſaue his company. Afterwards notwithſtanding ſeeing the great fire kindled neere vnto him, and the enemies much intermingled with the principall troupe of his men of war, and neereſt to his perſon, where the cōbate was moſt ſharp, and the enemies couragiouſly reskued, by the ſmall nūber which was there of gentlemen, he ioyned him togither with thoſe few that he had left, crying vnto them with a ſmiling and aſſured countenance; my ompanions, my freends, Battaile; Battaile, afterwards abandoning himſelfe to fortune, which hee had euer notwithſtanding ſo ill cheered, and entertained vntill then, without reſpect of his life, with the Sword in his fiſt he thruſt into the preſſe, and did as many great actes as was poſſible for him to doe; but the throng of his enemies continually waxed greater, and the number of his owne diminiſhed, as well by being abandoned by thoſe which fled, as by the death of the braueſt men ſlaine and beaten downe before him, other ſore wounded, and vnhorſed, taken, &amp; led away priſoners: in ſuch ſort as himſelfe ſore hurt with two Piſtoll ſhot in the body, and in his head, the horſe ſlayne vnder him,The D. de Aumelle ſore hurt taken Priſoner. was in the end thrown down &amp; taken. The B. of Bayonne ſaued himſelf, the Vicecount of Rohan was there ſlaine, for as 2. Germanes which held him priſonner had already taken from him his head peece, quarrelling who ſhould haue him, arriued a third,Death of Vicecount Rohan. who after many diſputes ſhot him into the brayne with a Piſtoll, whereof he preſently dyed. He was greatly lamented of all men, as one who greatlye contraried, and withſtoode ſtiffely this enterpriſe: the company of D. D' aumalle was almoſt all there defeated, and among other of renowne were ſlaine De Nancay guidon of the ſaide company; De la Motie Duſseau guidon of the Vidame of Charſtres companie, the guidon of the Earle of Sancerres company, S. Forgeus Captaine of the light horſe, the Baron of Couches, De Ioncy the yongeſt of the houſe of Rochebaron in Charollois, the yong Vaux, and ſundry other Gentlemen to the number of two hundred, of Priſonners remained many, together with the D. D'aumalle, among other Deſguilly maſter of the Camp of light horſe, the Baron of Guerres, and Do lieutenant of the Vidaſme of Charſtres company, who for not being known, and by the helpe of their freends, eſcaped for a ſmall raunſome. As for Bourdillon the ſame night ſome ſpeeches hauing bene reported vnto him, which the paiſans comming from thence vſed touching the defeate, preſently cauſed a Gentleman of his company to mount on horſeback, accompanied with ſome other to goe learne the matter better, and bring him the certainty thereof: afterwards within a ſhort ſpace following two Gentlemen of qualitie, which were hardly eſcaped thence, rehearſed vnto him how all the matter paſſed. Vpon this occaſion, without making any greater loſſe, or cauſing more trauaile to his men, he diſpatched that night Caſtellus lieutenant of his company, to carry the ſorrowfull newes to the King: and preſently ſent his Trumpeter, to the Earle of Vaudemont, to pray him to permit the bodies of Rohan and the Baron of Couches, to be buried within the Church at Nancy, as they were afterwards, and others in like ſorte.
            The Marqueſſe Albert hauing now his hart puffed vp, and receaued farre into the Emperours good grace, tooke againe his waye on towardes Nancy; where hee had much ſpeech with the Earle Vaudemont, touching this defeate, for amidſt his diſcourſes and pleaſant tales, hee laughed at the great hardines of the D. D'aumalle. Afterwards

he returned to encamp at Pont Camouſon on the other ſide of the riuer, whether anon the Emperour ſent vnto him a number of horſe to ſtrengthen &amp; aide him, vntill he might be ioyned to his campe, which was already aſſembled, and encamped about Metz. A little aboue the Pont aux Moras within the vynes, neere vnto an Abbey dedicated to S. Martin, was the quarter where the 13. of Nouember the Marqueſſe Albert went to entrench himſelfe, from whence hauing cauſed the D. of Aumalle to be dreſſed,The Caſtle of Clermont in Argonne ſurpriſed by Chaſtillon. he ſent him priſonner into Germanye to be kept in good ſuretie. The Kings army was arriued at Clermont in Argonne, a little village well ſcituate in the country of Barrois, aboue which on the top of a mountaine, is a Caſtle naturally ſtrong in reſpect of the height, vnacceſſable in two or 3. places; the which being very commodious and conuenient for many neceſsities, Chaſtillon partelye by craft, and partly through feare which the captaine of the place had, ſeeing the French army to arriue, ſurpriſed and rendred it to the diſpoſition of the Conſtable his Vncle, for the K. afterwards men wrought a long time to fortifie and amend it better, and an other little towne named Varenne; and in the villages round about all couertly was the K, army lodged; the Conſtable, (the D. of Neuers remaining Lieutenant general in the armie) departed thence, to goe ſee the K. at Reims, verye ſorye and greeued at this euill aduenture.
            As theſe were eagerly in armes there in Lorraine,Du Reux with the imperiall army would faine ſurpriſe La Fere in Picardie. ſo the reſt would not be at reſt in Pickardie, for Du Reux the Emperours Lieutenant generall in the low Countryes, with a number of Flemings; Hannuyers, and Wallons, amounting to fortie Enſignes of foote, and aboue two or three thouſand horſe, hauing entred into the fielde with reſolution to enforce and ſurpriſe La fere in Picardie, which appertaineth to the D. of Vendoſme, and after finding that hardly hee could compaſſe it with his honour, the Admirall D'Anebaut being there within, well prouided of whatſoeuer was neceſſary for him; after hauing burned the town of Noyon, Nelle, Chaunis, Roye, and a magnificent houſe which the late King Francis cauſed to be builded for the pleaſure of hunting, called Foulembray, with betweene ſeuen &amp; eight hundred villages, whereof the moſt parte were of the D. of Vendoſme his patrimony, and to ſpeak truly done infinite miſchiefes alwaies, by the means of the Queene of Hungary, went to beſiege Hedin: the towne was quickly taken,Hedin beſieged by Du Reux. not being ſtrong enough to ſuſtayne the batterie nor the aſſault: ſhortlye after the Caſtle was beſieged on the Parke ſide, where a great towre which defended the towres on that ſide, being much broken and the defences beaten downe and ſhattered to peeces, they found means to vndermine and digge downe a great peece of the wall, and with Cannon ſhotte to breake downe the ſquares and ſpurres as well of that great towre, as of the wall: wherefore the whole ſuncke downe and was turned topſie turuie within the ditche, which filled it vp, and made a bridge very eaſie to goe to the aſſault, the rampire remaining meerly vncouered and worne, they had no baskets nor platformes to couer it, and albeit the rampire was as yet ſeuen or eight foote high, they within notwithſtanding ſeeing the wal ſo ſuddenly fallen down &amp; the ditch filled, were ſo amaſed &amp; aſtonied, as without tarrying any aſſault, they yeelded themſelues to compoſition,Hedin yeelded to the Emperour by de Raſse. their liues and goods ſaued, &amp; the cōpoſition was made by de Raſse and Ianlis, to which D'ouoye of the houſe of Querqui would neuer conſent. At this loſſe the K. much maruelled, conſidering that a litle before De Raſse had certified him that he had no doubt at all of the holding out of that caſtle, but that which was found moſt ſtrange, and that gaue to the French occaſion diuerſly to ſpeak, was that De Raſse had euer a good reputation

of a valiant Knight:Admirall de Anebaut dieth at La Fere. hereupon the King vnderſtanding of the death of the Admirall D' Anebaut, deceaſed at La Fere in Picardie, whether hee was retired to defend it from the Imperials, departed from Reims to approch as farre as Challons, whether the D. of Neuers, the Marſhall S. Andre, de Chaſtillon, and the principall chieftanes of his army came vnto him, to the end to aduiſe and conclude as ſoone as might be, of ſome way how to recouer Hedin:The D. of Griſe aſſured within Metz. therefore the D. of Guiſe was ſent vnto, to know of him how long time he could be able to defend Metz, and if he were in any neceſſitie, hee ſhould be the ſooner ſuccoured, who aſſuring himſelfe of the will of God, and of the faith &amp; loyaltie of many valiant men which had followed and watched about his perſon, certified the King that there was no doubt at al of his towne, nor of thoſe which were within, in all whom he knew alike and ſemblable affection for his ſeruice, chuſing rather to leaue their liues then to go out of that place with diſhonor. Beſides that he had want of nothing whatſoeuer, whereby hee ſhould not be able to keepe it againſt all power of man, with the aide of him, without whom he watcheth in vaine, which will vndertake the keeping of any places: hee aduertiſed him in like ſorte,The diſtribution of the Imperiall army about Metz. how that the ſecond day of Nouember the D. of Alua with the greateſt parte of the Imperiall armye, hauing quitted the lodging at Belle Croix (Brabanſon being left there with three Regiments of high Germanes, two of lowe, and three thouſand horſe) and paſſed the Riuer of Seille, was come to encampeneere vnto the Towne, diſtributing his army in the places about, as at S. Clement, and at S. Arnoul, where he was lodged with the ſpaniſh companies: One parte of the Germanes was lodged at Pont de Magny, Dom Louis d'Auilla with the Spaniſh cauallerie at La Maladiere, the Seneſhal of La Morauie with the Bohemian horſe at Blery, the ouerplus at Ollerye, S. Priech, at the grange aux Dames, at the grange aux Mercieres, and other places about: certifying him further how that they had begun their trenches neere vnto the Porte S. Thibaut, as if they purpoſed there to plante their principall battery. In the end he wrote the names and ſurnames of ſuch as had beſt perfourmed their dutye in ſallies out and skirmiſhes; not forgetting many other affaires as the time ſerued, in his anſwere.The D, of Ne-Lieutenant generall ouer all the K. forces in Loraine. The King thus ſtanding aſſured on that parte, ordained the D. of Neuers his Lieutenant generall ouer all his forces, which remained in Lorraine: and for the good and agreeable ſeruices which Gaſper de Coligny, called Chaſtillon, had done him and daily did, he honored him with the office of Admirall of France, and at the very inſtant conſtituted him his Lieutenant, to bring back his army into Picardye, there to reſolue vpon and execute, whatſoeuer ſhould be moſt profitable and neceſſary for his ſeruice.Chaſtillon being made Admirall of France bringeth all the K. army from out of Picardy toward Hedin. Afterwardes all the chiefetanes being aduertiſed and inſtructed in their charges, the armie was leuied by the Admirall, to cauſe it to take the right way towardes Hedin: the Marſhall S. Andre was retired to Verdun, the D. of Neuers with his company, and that of La Roche du Maine, retired to S. Michel, to the end to cut of al victuals fom the enimie and turn them away parting themſelues in ſundrye companies within the Vallyes: within S. Michel there were already the Enſignes of Captain La Prade and of La Mothe Gondrin on hundred lighthorſe of captaine Pelous, and one hundred Harquebuſiers of Captain Lauenture and Bourdillon with his company, who a little before was returned from that place, whether the D. Aumalle had written vnto him.The D. of Neuers his companies make roads to cut off victualles from the enemies.
            
            As ſoone as the D. of Neuers was arriued at S. Michel, there was a road made by his companie, with certaine light horſe and Harquebuſiers on horſeback, vnder the charge of Mouy, guidon of his company, a valiant and reſolute gentleman, as farre as

Malatour, a little towne ſtrong inough neere vnto Gorges, and in other great villages, which couered a valley ſtrong inough, full of hollowe woodes and daungerous places, which they of the Countrie called La Veur, into which certaine ſouldiers were retyred, as well Spaniſh as Germanes, of the imperiall auantgard. Some were ſlaine, and the reſt carried awaie priſoners. This misfortune fel vpon thoſe as returned from the caſtle of Aſpremont, thinking to haue taken the Earle there in his bed, to whom it happened ſo well, as at that inſtant he was at Saint Michael neere vnto the Duke of Neuers. For in ſtead of thinking to take, they were taken, &amp; carried awaie with ſome bootie. Such roads there and abouts were continued by the Duke of Neuers for the ſpace of three weekes, himſelfe beeing there ſometimes in perſon, which ſo ſore annoied and troubled his enimies, as they were inforced to forget the waie of that quarter. Yea, by reaſon of theſe continuall alarums, the imperiall armie was oftentimes conſtrayned to remaine halfe a daie in battell, with great trauell, coldes, and other neceſsities. But if they endured much, the French men were not cleane exempted, becauſe that ofteneſt times they were faine to mount on horſebacke at midnight, induring ſo ſharpe froſts and colde, as ſome of them haue euer ſince had diuerſe of theyr members benummed, and other dead, loſt by the paine and inſupportable torments which they indured, hauing continually the ſnowe vp to their horſe bellies: &amp; in ſuch equipage paſſed they the daie and night without food, after in the daie time, &amp; when they thought to repoſe themſelues, and take a litle breath in theyr lodging, they were faine to keepe the watch for feare of ſurpriſall: ſo as, as well to keepe themſelues, as to annoie and plague the imperials, they endured theyr parte of the diſcommoditie of the time, but much leſſe as they wel witneſſed, which had abandoned thē: the Italians aboue all, who dayly went threedmeale from the Emperours campe, to beſeech the Duke of Neuers to receiue them into the Kings ſeruice, who moued with pittie,The Italians of the Emperours campe repaired to the Duke of Neuers to be intertained in the kings ſeruice. ſeeing ſome dead, and halfe paſsing, other hunger ſtarued without monie, vſed all liberalitie poſsible towardes them, and cauſed monie to bee giuen them out of his owne coffers attending the kings paie. Afterwardes he ſent them to Captaine Andre de May More, a man of approued hardineſſe, to dreſſe of them companies as well of foote as light cauallerie. By them &amp; other ſpials the French were aduertiſed of the moſt great diligence and wonderful preparatiues which the Duke of Alua had made to addreſſe his batterie, the great plaines, the trenches, ſo ample, large, and deepe, as hath bin ſeene of long time, the great number of artillerie and munitions, the almoſt innumerable quantitie of baskets, which hee cauſed continually without anie reſt to bee made and filled, making no account of the life of thoſe miſerable vaſcadors, no more than of bruite beaſts expoſed to the mercie of the artillerie and counterbatterie of the towne. They reported lykewiſe the great harmes and annoiances that they within did inceſſantly vnto them, theyr reſolute ſallies, ſo furious &amp; in ſuch ſort, as ſome thought them rather ghoſts and deuilliſh ſpirites than mortall creatures. And others reporting how the conduct of the moſt part of theyr ſallies was happily executed, attributed all to a raſhneſſe and bolde hardineſſe, more than to wiſedome or anie diſcreete foreſight of the inconueniences lyke to happen, in ſuch ſorte; as one Sergeant of a band, accompanyed with fiue or ſixe ſouldiers onely, with his halbard chaſed awaie, and conſtrained to abandon the trenches more than three hundred men. Some other in like ſort durſt goe and naile theyr artillerie, and kill their canoniers vpon theyr peeces. The which the enemies notwithſtanding woulde not repute as a fact worthie either of them, nor of a valyant and magnanimious heart. Beſides that, twice or thrice a daie the cauallerie

iſſued forth, putting the imperials often inough in ſuch diſorder, as ſome of the moſt hardieſt Gentlemen, which woulde doo anie act worthie of memorie, or for the remembrance or loue of their miſtreſſes, would goe breake theyr lances, and ſtrike with theyr ſwoords euen within the enemies tents, ſo farre as to cut their ropes aſunder, executing ſtrange things, and not heard of in our memorie. Now if the French by ſuch feates were deſirous to ſhew themſelues loyall ſubiectes to their king, and curious of honour, the Duke of Alua repoſed not leſſe of his part, who ſhewed himſelfe ſo deſirous and inflamed to render into the obedience of his maiſter the Emperour, that puiſant Citie, to reioyce him with the taking of ſo many princes, great Lordes, and valyant men as were there within, that not ſparing anie labor, nor the liues of his, he planted his batterie readie the twentith of Nouember, beginning to ſhoote at the defences, to wit, at that of the portall of the port Champenois, and of a bulwarke which is within a great tower, the which is towardes the riuer called La Tour D'Enfen, and ſurnamed La Tour de Lanques, &amp; at a little Church being within the town, where there was a platform, in ſumme, they razed and ruined as much as they could, whatſoeuer might ſerue as they iudged to the defence of the towne. The ſix &amp; twentith he began to cannon it with ſuch an impetuoſitie, as in the memory of anie liuing man was neuer heard the like, hauing in front fortie great peeces, which carrying bullets of an extraordinarie waight, ſhot daie and night without anie intermiſsion, other than to refreſh themſelues. In the mean time the beſieged ſlept not, but with the princes and great Lordes, and generally euen to the verie leaſt, they carryed earth &amp; panniers to rampire, in ſuch diligence and carefulneſſe, as at any place where they imagined the breach ſhould be made, in leſſe than twice foure and twentie houres they made vp the rampire the height of a perapect, leauing betweene the old wall and the rampire conuenient flankers, &amp; a trench farced with diuerſe drogs, to feaſt the moſt hotly diſpoſed, if they meant to goe to the aſſalt. Attending which; I will looke back againe into the exploits of the French armie.
            As ſoone as de Reux with the Flanders armie, which as yet remained about Hedin, perceiued the French to approach, without anie countenaunce at all made to be willing to fight for maintenance of them which were redie to be beſieged within, he retyred, leauing his ſonne in the caſtle, to whome hee vowed and ſwore great puniſhment if hee yeelded the place with diſhonour and reproch. With the ſame charge he left with him his companion, a Henault Gentleman named Harenuille. So the breach beeing made farre ſtronger by them than before, and ſtanding prouided and ſtrengthened with whatſoeuer they could imagine to bee neceſſarie for them, they ſowed a bruite that both the one and the other woulde rather die there within, than yeelde themſelues ſo good cheap as they that firſt went out thence. Shortly after the French armie beeing arriued, the Duke of Vendoſme, Lieutenant for the King in Picardie, cauſed his approaches to bee made, and one of his batteryes to bee planted in the verie ſame place where the Bourgonians had addreſſed theirs, and the other vppon the ſlope of a little hill of the ſide of Therouanne. So Hedin began to bee cannoned the ſeuenteenth of December moſt furiouſly, and there were diſcharged foure thouſand three ſcore,The caſtle of Hedin yelded vp by de Reux his ſon to the D. of Vendoſme for the king. and ſixe ſhot of Cannon, without making anie breach or ouerture, that had not yet a rampire behinde eighteene or twentie foote high. Yet faintneſſe of heart and feare of death ceazed the beſieged, who yeelded themſelues by compoſition, theyr liues and goods ſaued, theyr Enſignes diſplayed, with two meane peeces of artillerie at theyr tayle, wythout taking awaie ought, or tranſporting of anie thing els

of that which they had found within: ſo the caſtle of Hedin was yelded and rendered vnto the Kings obedience, by the conduct of the Duke of Vendoſme, the eighteenth of December. And albeit that the chiefe was acquited of his dutie in keeping it, yet fearing his fathers cholar, he remained a long time not daring to preſent himſelf before him. Sodainly after the Duke of Vendoſme beeing aduertiſed that the enemies meant to paſſe ouer the riuer, to giue him battel at the houre that he parled with them of Hedin, by the Kings aduiſe hee purpoſed to eaſe them of that paine, and him ſelfe went to ſeeke them out with his forces, with intention to fight with them if they would abide. But not finding themſelues ſtrong inough, they retired towardes the ſtrong townes, and further into the heart of the Countrie, quitting vnto him the paſſages to execute his good pleaſure, and a means to reuenge himſelfe of thoſe cruelties which they had committed vpon his lands.
            At ſuch time as theſe affayres thus paſſed there, the Duke of Neuers hauing cauſed on the ſide of Saint Michael many and ſundry roads to be made, to the great damage of the enemies of the crowne of Fraunce, departed thence by an intelligence which he had, how that on the ſide of Eſpinaux, by the Countie of Vaudemont,The D. of Neuers at Vauco

                     •
                  s, to ſtop ſuch victuals as came from the French countie to the Emperors camp, &amp; his courſes to anoy the imperials. ordinarilye came downe great quantitie of victuals &amp; prouiſions to the Emperors campe. Therfore with thoſe few men of warre which he was able to recouer, beeing two hundred men at armes, two hundred light horſe, and as many harguebuziers on horſeback, he retired towards Vaucouleurs, a little French village, renouned inough vpon the riuer of Meuſe, within fiue leagues of Thoul, included within many of the lands of Lorain, from whence within two daies after he departed to go towardes Thoul, thether cauſing his forces to approach, which he made to be lodged in a verie faire and great village named Blanieau, a temporall lordſhip &amp; roialtie of the Chapitre of S. Stephens of Thoul, and in other little ones adioyning. Shortly after their comming was a role made of the men at arms, and archers, the moſt likely and beſt mounted, to the number of ſixe ſcore, conducted by Mouy, to breake and cut vp the head of a maruellous great pond in the countie of Vaudemont, thereby to drowne and deſtroy a number of villages which were vnderneath it, whether many victuals had retired themſelues, and where the enemies forages found yet great ſtore of corne and forage: which notwithſtanding was alreadie found broken and cut vp, to the great hinderaunce of the Countie. The French men hauing made the hole greater, and returning homewards, met with a great troup of waggons &amp; chariots, laden with all ſortes of victualers and munitions, addreſſed to the imperiall campe. Whereof hauing made the greateſt ſpoile that they were able, with a great deale of wines of Arbois, and marred the ouerplus, and hauing ſlaine ſome of the guides and waggoners, led away as many horſes as they were able, and retired with great daunger, notwithſtanding that they were conſtrained to paſſe at full daie through ſundrie villages where ſome of the enemyes were lodged, as wel of foot as horſe. The which notwithſtanding fell out without the loſſe of anie one, in reſpect they were not knowen, apparelled like marchants, without anie white croſſes or ſcarfes ſeene, and their harneſſe couered with their cloakes, beeing likewiſe thought to be auantcouriers, to drawe them to an ambuſcade, or fearing leaſt the greater troupes of the enemies were couered and laie hid. Wherefore the D. of Neuers verie much contented herewith, anon after retired to Vaucouleurs.
            Now to looke backe againe to what the Emperour did before Metz,A guile to paſſe amidſt ones enemies without danger. hee trauelled there with ſmall aduantage, all the thunder and ſtrange impetuoſitie of his artillerie not able to make one hole or paſſage fit to giue the aſſault, which the Marques Albert
               
demaunded of him;The Emperours battery at Metz. thinking thereby further to aduaunce himſelfe into his good fauour, for that hauing well neere ſhaken all the great tower D'enfer, all the great parte of wall betweene the tower and the porte Champenois, with the bulwarke which couered it, he could not raiſe the vaumure, otherwiſe termed fanſe-braie, which held vp the quarters of the wall that fell, and were ſtayed the one vpon the other, betweene this vaumure and the foote of the wall, no wayes filling of the ditch, which remayned as neate, large, and deepe as before: nay, they ſerued them within for a ſtronger rampire.Mines begun to be made by the imperials before Metz, to make a breach. Wherefore it was thought good the batterie ſhoulde bee chaunged to another place a little aboue, and to vndermine that parte, to turne topſie turuie into the ditch that ſame vaumure and fanſe-braie: whereof the Duke of Guiſe beeing aduertiſed, hee cauſed countermines to bee made within in ſundrie places, in which hee might haue anie knowledge, and prouide for theyr paſſages, in ſuch ſorte, as they had not long digged and hollowed theyr mines, but the ſentinels and ſcoutes of the beſieged might eaſily heare and perceiue them, the which began to diſcourage them, to daunt and quayle greatly in theyr enterpriſe. Ioyne that then, as well by reaſon of the maruellous coles, as thorough the neceſsities and defaultes of ſundrie thinges for the men of warre, the verie Germanes beganne euen to fayle of courage, who cauſed to bee ſignifyed vnto the Emperour, that it woulde pleaſe his maieſtie to command a reaſonable breach to bee made, to enter and take the towne, chooſing rather to die honourable at an aſſault, than miſerably to fall by colde and extreame famine. It was then that the Emperour iudging of the impoſsibilitie of the taking thereof, was pricked with an acknowledgement of his fault, and wyth a great griefe to haue there ſetled ſo euyll a beginning, for ſeeing ſo ſhamefull an end to ſo hotte deſſeines, yet to make them lifte vp theyr heartes, and incourage them to his power, hee promiſed them that if by the ende of the yeere hee dyd not make a reaſonable breach, hee woulde giue them leaue to departe, which made them to temporize, and take patience. Whereupon to make proofe of this good affection, hee commaunded agayne the Duke of Alua wyth all diligence to cauſe theſe mines alreadie begunne to bee continued and purſued, the which he did with ſo great and feruent a deſire, that hee abandoned the worke neyther night nor daie. But the time was ſo contrarye vnto him, as all remayned vnperfect, wherefore if then in the enemies campe euerie man fayled of force and courage, the French increaſed from houre to houre, making more and more continuall ſallies and charges vpon them, wherewith they dayly diminiſhed their armie, for ſome ſtole awaie, and retired by whole troupes into theyr Countries, others in great number were found ſtiffe, and frozen within the trenches, lodgings, tents, and quarters, and many pale, diſeaſed in their liuers, and dead for hunger, partly for that they were ſo euill paide, the Emperours treaſure beeing verie much conſumed. Who ſeeing the tearme promiſed to the Germanes to draw neere, hauing before his eyes a fearefull kinde of ſhame to returne, without hauing done anie honourable action, himſelfe beeing there in perſon, cauſed ſome to practiſe with them, to ſound them whether they wold be content to go with him to beſiege Thoul, an imperiall towne, whereof men could not be able to finiſh the fortification, by reaſon of the plague which had taken awaie ſo great a number of the inhabitants. To which they made anſwere, that they had not deliberated vppon it, and they were commanded by the Princes &amp; electors, not to paſſe anie further vntill Metz were firſt taken or yelded vp. Therefore if it woulde pleaſe his maieſtie to make anie breach hee opened as hee promiſed, they were all readie either to die there, or enter in:

from this time about the eighteenth of December hee began to cauſe his beſt and greateſt peeces of artillerie to retire. A lyttle after hauing aſſembled together all his Councell, to conclude of an honourable retreate, it was commaunded to the Earle of Aiguemont, Colonell, and chiefe of two Regimentes of Cauallerie lodged at Pont Camouſon, to go downe with his forces all alongeſt the riuer as farre as Thoul, &amp; as much lower as was poſsible for him, to diſcouer the Countrie, and know what number of men of warre might be there all along with the Duke of Neuers, doubting leaſt at his retreate ſome greater anoiances might be done him. Wherupon this Earle departed with his Cauallerie from Pont Camouſon, &amp; paſsing along the Mozelle as far as Thoul, cauſed it to bee ſummoned in paſsing thorough the ſuburbes, addreſsing his Trumpetter to D'eſclauolles, who was the gouernour. Who hauing vnderſtoode the Chiamade, made a ſigne to him with his hand that hee ſhould retyre, albeit that hee had iuſt occaſion to doubt vpon this ſummons, ſeeing the want of victualles, the towne pregnable, and to bee battered on euerie ſide, euill prouided of artillerie and munitions, whereof hee aduertiſed the Duke of Neuers, who was at Vaucouleurs. But the Gentleman of his houſe who carryed the newes, named Torte eſper, was taken by the waie by ſome of that Cauallerie, ſcattered to finde ſome wandering bootie as it befell vnto them, for hauing taken from him an hundred crownes which he had vnder his faddle, they ſtript him no further: but hee ſhewed himſelfe ſo accord, as finding himſelfe halfe at libertie, hee ſaued himſelfe acroſſe the woode, thorough the darkneſſe of the night, and ſo perfourmed his meſſage. And as ſoone as the Duke of Neuers receiued this aduertiſement, hee ſent all night long to fetch his men of warre at the inſtant to come vnto him, which was lodged one or two leagues of. And Albeit that it was at a time of reſt, and that the moſt parte were alreadie aſleepe, his commaundement notwithſtanding was, that euerie man ſhoulde bring his armour on his backe, and readily mount on horſebacke. So they parted all the night wyth keeping a good watch, as it was reaſon, becauſe that this Earle approached as neere them as they coulde, and went vppon the brinke of the riuer into a village called Dagny vppon Meuſe, thinking to ſurpriſe them. But ſeeing the fire of all ſides, hearing the noyſe and neighing of horſes, and by other tokens knowing howe they had warning and attended him, hee retyred backe his wayes, where returning vp the riuer of Mozell, hee paſſed neere vnto a lyttle towne named Gondreuille, ſeated vppon the banke of that riuer, of the ſide of Nancie. On the other parte a lyttle before was arriued the Baron of Guerres, which returned freſhly from a roade, who not aduertiſed of his enemyes beeing ſo neere him, wanted verie lyttle of paſsing the riuer of Bac, which if hee had done, as much had happened vnto him as did to ſome others that were of his companie, who for hauing croſſed the riuer aleady on the enemyes ſide, were ſurpiſed, ſome hurt, others taken priſoners, and fewe or none killed or ſlayne, the Baron ſaued himſelfe wythin the lyttle towne, and was not rigorouſly purſued, as well for the darkeneſſe of the night, as the feare which they had leaſt they ſhoulde bee charged vpon. That verie ſame night was S. Simon, a Gentleman of the houſe of the Duke of Neuers ſent wyth fyue and twentye horſe as farre as Thoul, to vnderſtande of Eſclauolles the ſucceſſe of the enterpriſe aboue ſayd. Vpon whoſe report Fouronne, a Gentleman of his houſe, was forthwith diſpatched and ſent by the Duke of Neuers to aduertiſe the King of all the proceedinges. Who in ſhort aunſwere ſent vnto him, and prayed him to ſearch out by all meanes poſsible that hee coulde, howe that towne of Thoul myght

bee preſerued, and holde out onely for fifteene dayes, within which time hee woulde not fayle himſelfe to come to ſuccour it wyth all his power. The Duke vppon this aunſwere, woulde not put anie other in truſt with this charge, but reſeruing it vnto himſelfe, the two and twentith of December followed by Bordillon, De Bigny maſter of the Q. houſeholde, d'Eſchenets and de Giry Enſigne of his companie, he went and lodged within the towne thus vnprouided. As ſoone as the Duke was there arriued, hee made the round vpon the walls about the towne, and viſited a beginning of rampires and platformes, which D'Eſcauolles had begun to frame wythin, the which was found to bee excellently well inuented by the ingeners and maſters of fortifications, whome hee cauſed to come thether, to conſider of, and addreſſe the diſpoſing and finiſhing of this fortification, enterpriſed and imprinted ſo deepely in his affection, that there remayned not one man about his perſon, to whome hee gaue not ſome commiſsion, and hee himſelfe the moſt part of the time ſtirred not, interrupting the ordinarie houres of his meales, ſo greatly was he affectionate to that worke, that there reſted verie ſmall time that hee ſawe not ſome platforme made vp in defence, which carryed his name, De Bordillon was as buſie about another, and they ſeemed to bee almoſt iealous of the perfection of theyr workes. Beſides, hee made ſearch to be made throughout all the houſes, garners, and ſellers, and to take an oath of all thoſe which inhabited there, to knowe what corne, wines, haie, fourage, and of euerie kinde of victuals might bee wythin the Towne, to the ende that order might bee taken therein. But there was a ſmall deale founde, hauing beene carryed awaye before by the Burgeſſes and thoſe which were retyred to other places for feare of the plague, and that which remayned wythin the towne was conſumed and ſpoiled without reaſon, by the ſouldyers, and ſuch as remayned there during this peryll. Then beeing informed how that into two little townes, Thoul, and Gondeuille, greate quantitie was carryed as well out of the plaine Countrie, as little townes and French lands, for feare of the enemyes, hee ſent to ſummon them, and gaue commandement that it ſhoulde bee brought and ſtored vp wythin Thoul. To Gondeuille was ſent Eſchenets, followed a farre off by an Enſigne of footemen, wyth a certayn number of horſe. The Prouoſt and the inhabitants, after ſome difficulties, ſawe themſelues ſo ſodaynly ſurpriſed, that in the ende they aduiſed themſelues to obey. They of Thoul grew ſtubborne, forgetting themſelues in the regarde of Mouie, who was ſent vnto them with fiftie, horſe of the Duke of Neuers his companie, and an Enſigne of fanterie, to ſummon them to obey the Kings Lieutenant. Notwithſtanding after his honeſt perſwaſions, ſeeing the Prouoſt conteſtate, and at his diſſembled preſumption the inhabitants rebellious, hee cauſed the towne preſently to bee ſcaled, and taken as ſhee was by aſſault, they ſomewhat felt the payment of theyr refuſall. Mouie notwithſtanding cauſed the furie of the French ſouldyers to ceaſe, alreadie heated at the ſlaughter. The Enſigne of Fanterie remained and lodged there, vntill that all the victuals which were within were carryed to Thoul, wythout taking or carrying awaie anie thing, thereby to maintayne them alwayes in theyr Neutralitie: ſo all victuals and munition were carryed to Thoul from all partes, by the commandement of the generall, with ſo good order, as euerie man liued ſomewhat better, and wyth more diſcretion than before. And after hauing conſidered howe in caſe the ſiege ſhoulde bee, the towne woulde bee verie ill prouided of footmen, hee cauſed foure other companies to enter in, which made vp the number of eighteene hundred fantaſsins, &amp; ſome light horſe, ouer and aboue the ordinarie garriſon.
            
               The Duke of Neuers beeing heereupon aduertiſed,The Emperour vpon the point to retire from Metz. how the Emperour euen longed to retyre himſelfe, and how his armie euerie daie broke and diminiſhed, ſeldome ſuffered anie daie to paſſe wythout ſending ſome people ouer the Countrie to haſten theyr going: ſo as oftentimes in ſtead of aduauncing forwarde, they cauſed them to recoyle backe inough wyth a number of priſoners which they tooke. Notwythſtanding they founde them in ſo great pouertie, as they were faine to let them paſſe wythout anie harme dooing. In this eſtate remayned they vntyll the laſt daie of the moneth of December, that the Emperour vnderſtanding of the taking of the caſtle of Hedin, ſeeing himſelfe to fall and to diminiſh of euerie thinge, fearing beſides the returne of the Kings armie, and to fall into greater loſſe, was one of the firſt which retyred on new yeeres daie, leauing all the charge to the Duke of Alua, for the departing of his armie, and ordering of the retreate. As ſoone as his departure was knowen throughout the campe, the wayes and villages rounde about were ſodaynly full of ſouldyers, which retyred themſelues, the one into theyr quarter, the other whether they were able, in ſo great miſerie, as verie beaſts, were they neuer ſo cruell, woulde haue taken pittie of thoſe miſerable ſouldiers, falling and ſtaggering along the high waies in extreme neceſsitie, and moſt commonly dying neere the hedges, and at the rootes of buſhes, to become a praie to dogges and birdes. And which is yet more to bee lamented by men of courage, to bee inforced to die ſo poorelye, without hauing made anie great proofe at all of theyr valor. The which ought greatly to moue the heartes of ſuch men, as God hath rendered ſo happie in this worlde, that they neuer felt nor aſſayed the hardneſſe of warre. And when they ſpeake with a full belly and the cuppe in theyr hande, it ſeemeth vnto them a wedding, to liue in ſuch an eſtate as conſiſteth not in thouſand and thouſand of perills, more than in the daunger both of ſoule and bodie, except it bee wiſely &amp; iuſtly executed. Not to looſe anie time vppon the intelligence which the Duke of Neuers had receiued, hee ſent Mouie, and the Captaine Andre de Maye More, wyth about fiue hundred horſe, as well of men at armes, as harguebuziers on horſebacke, to put on theyr ſpurres agaynſt the inhabitants of the Countie, retyring themſelues into theyr quarters, where there wanted verie lyttle, that the ſonne of Granuelle, the Baron of Carlaon, and others, had not beene there ſtaied, but doubting themſelues of that comming, by ſlacke and long treates, they ſaued themſelues. Hauing failed of this their firſt enterpriſe, they at one treat went at the point of day to lie in ambuſcade neere Ramberuilliers, within which was a Commiſſarie of victualles, which came from the Franche comte to the Emperour, and the maſter of the monie of Beſanſon, with two other marchauntes which brought great quantitie of all kinde of victualles and prouiſions. The commiſſaries and marchants were before horſed and guided by a Lorrainer, who ſerued for a ſpie, by whome the Duke of Neuers was certainly aduertiſed what hee was to put in execution for theyr ſurpriſall. Wherefore as they were in ambuſcade neere inough to the towne, Andre de Maye ſent certayne Italian ſouldyers, which were to aduertiſe the ambuſcade, by a ſigne if they entered, and gaine the port vpon the gardes, ſo as faining to come from the imperiall campe, and to indure great colde and hunger, they lamented ſo much, as they were let to goe ſeeke ſome victuals. Anon after ſome other came thether, who did as the firſt, &amp; in ſuch wiſe as ſeeming ſtrong inough to repulſe the gards from the ports, who were but Lorain peſāts armed with old bils, rotten ſtaues, and ruſtie brigandines, Andre ſpeaking excellent good Spaniſh, was no ſooner ariued, but the ſoldiers who were aduertiſed of the ſigne made them, charged

vppon the porters halfe aſleepe, and the reſt dronke, of whome ſome were maſſacred, other conſtrained to abandon the gates, which were a little after opened to all the reſt of the ambuſcade, who beeing aduertiſed thereof, couragiouſly entered in. I leaue you to thinke what good husbandrie there was made. The Comiſsarie was founde there hidde in the bedſtrawe, and wyth theſe marchants was carryed priſoner to Thoul, the victuals and prouiſions diſpearſed, and ſpoyled as much as they coulde. They did as much at Eſpinau, a caſtle ſcituate vpon Mozelle and Rimiremont, where great violence was offered to the Abbeſſe and Ladies, eſpecially by the Italians which were newly come from the Emperous campe to the Kings ſeruice. The Duke of Neuers had ſent Chaſtellus Lieutenant of Bordillons companie, towardes Metz with like number of Cauallerie, to learne out and make a certaine report of the truth of this retrait. Who paſsing by the Pont Camouſon, founde that the Count of Aiguemont with his regiment of Cauallerie was departed thence: where was onely remayning a great number of miſerable ſicke creatures. From whence he paſſed as farre as Metz, where hee found that the Dukes of Alua and Brabanſon, with the greateſt part of the imperiall armie were diſlodged in ſtraunge diſorder,Retreat of the imperiall armie before Metz. departing in the night with two fires onely for ſignall, the moſt ſecretly that they could, without anie noiſe, trumpets, fifes, and drums ſleeping, the tents lefte behind, and great quantitie of all ſorts of harneſſe and weapons, pipes full of cannon pouder, with an infinite deale of moueables and ſtuffe, and vnder the ground a great part of theyr artillerie There were aboue ſeuen thouſand men put into Abbies by the D. of Guiſe and releeued, as oftē hath ben reported vnto me the Tranſlator, by the moſt renowmed Lord C. H. L. high Admirall of England, who himſelfe ſaw all, remained in the towne all the ſiege, and ſerued the daie that the Duke of Aumall gaue battell to the Marques, narowly eſcaping, being of the ſuit of the Vidaſme of Chartres, in al thoſe warres. remaining for hoſtages, an incredible multitude of ſicke perſons, towards whom the Duke of Guiſe, and the reſt of the chiefe, euen to the ſimpleſt French ſouldiers, vſed moſt great charitie, furniſhing them with all neceſſaries, and ſuch releefe as poore ſick ſtrangers had need of. Vpon the tayle charged the Vidaſme of Charſtres, ſo as hauing defeated a companie of light horſe, and cauſed a great deale of theyr pouder which hee had taken awaie in theyr ſight to be burned, hee returned wyth more priſoners than he was willing, wythout the loſſe of anie one of his owne. The Marques Albert remayned the laſt to ſerue for helpe and arreregard, not without great paine and hazard, thorough the continuall alarums which daie and night hee receyued. Beſides that, he prayed the Duke of Neuers to haſten him to go, ſo as the third of Ianuarie he departed from Thoul with his men at armes, and cauallerie, and three Enſignes of fanterie, accompanied with Bordillon and ſundrie other Gentlemen and Captaines. After he went to dine at Pont Camouſon, where the reſt of that daie he tarryed to heare newes of the Marſhall of Saint Andre, who was gone the lower waie: hauing in lyke ſort ſent Mouie to the Duke of Guiſe, praying him to aduertiſe him of the resolution of that affayre, whoſe aunſwere hee attended. But Chaſtellus being returned, and by him aſſured of the whole, eſpecially how the Marques ſought all meanes to ſaue himſelfe and retire, hee went forwards towardes Metz with two hundred horſe. The reſt of that daie the Princes tooke great pleaſure to ſee the braue ſallies and skirmiſhes of theyr ſouldiers. Vpon the Marques &amp; his Germanes whom they went to ſeeke out in their owne forte, and giue them thruſts of pikes, and harquebuze ſhot euen within theyr tents,Sallies &amp; skirmimiſhes between the ſoldiers with in Metz. &amp; Marques Alberts campe. to prouoke them to come out into the plaine to fight, which they woulde not doo but by conſtraint, keeping ſtill cloſe together, and vnited, wythout breaking or ſeuering themſelues. In this eſtate and paine were they conſtrained to tarrie from morning vntill night, not once daring to inlarge themſelues ſo much as to ſeeke out victuals. For as ſoone as they were found in anie ſmall number, by and by, by the Marangetz and Fouillardz, villaines of the Countrie, they had theyr throates cut, and

were defeated. Wherewith being the more annoyed, they ought rather to come out as the French deſired, conſidering that they coulde not inforce them but with greate loſſe. Therefore to the end they might the more vexe them, the Duke cauſed foure meane Culuerines to bee placed in a lyttle Ilande aboue Pont au Mores, which ſhot euen within them. In ſumme, they dyd ſo ſore annoye them, as two dayes after the Marques hauing loſt the better parte of his men, departed thence in a farre leſſe number than hee came with, taking his waie towards Treuues. Hee was a little followed after, and they made a good market wyth his people, being combatted inough wyth colde, famine, and other miſeries. But the French moued with pittie made no account thereof: but in ſtead of tormenting them, they opened vnto them the paſſage, and ſuffered the members to go ſcotfree, wiſhing onely that they might haue gotten the head to haue paid for all.
            The Duke of Guiſe aduertiſed the King by Randan of all the ſucceſſe of his ſiege,Thankeſgiuings to God by the French for the ſiege raiſed at Metz. who after hauing yeelded thankes vnto God for ſo good an iſſue, commaunded that they ſhould make publyke and general proceſsions throughout his Realme, to praiſe and thanke God of ſo great and eſpeciall a grace for all France. The Duke of Guiſe dyd the lyke at Metz wyth a generall proceſsion, where he himſelfe was preſent with all humilitie and deuotion, as alſo dyd the reſt of the Princes and Lordes which accompanyed him, to wit, the Princes of D'anguien, de Conde, Montpenſier, la Roche Suryon, de Nemours, Horace Farneze, Pierre Stroſsie, le Vidaſme de Chartres, Montmorencie, D'anuille, de Gonor, gouernour of Metz, De la Broſse, Lieutenant of the Duke of Lorraines companie, and De la Rochefoucaut, the Vizecount of Turaine, and De Martiques, D'elangues, Entragues, De Biron, and Saint Remy, and generally all the Captaines, Gentlemen, and ſouldyers which remayned after the ſiege. Afterwardes hauing ordered the garriſon which ſhould remaine there within, and diſpoſed of all the reſt of the affaires, the muſters being taken as wel of the men at armes as the fanterie, he gaue leaue to all to go repoſe and refreſh themſelues in their owne houſes, and he himſelfe went to the Court, leauing De Gonnor to command in his place.
            During the time that the Emperour patiently carryed the misfortune happened vnto him, vnder a hope of a more fauourable to come, and as hee retired to the Low Countries, hee excuſed himſelfe towardes the Princes and Cities of the Empire of ſo pittifull ſucceſſe, laying it vpon the ſlacknes of theyr forces and meanes. For which cauſe, ſayde hee, hee was inforced to ſet vpon that place in the dead of winter: The King of France triumphed ouer his miſeries, and increaſing them by his Letters and Embaſſages to all Chriſtian Princes, the more to diminiſh the authoritie and credite of his enemie, whoſe power hee ſayde was altogether broken by the iſſue of ſo miſerable a ſiege, paſſed the moſt parte of the times for reuenge of ſo great raines and ſicknes, as had beene indured by the continuance of the warres paſsed, in eaſe and reioycings which hee tooke in feaſtings, tiltings, turney, and other royall pleaſures, among which, the marriage made at Paris wyth rare magnificence, betweene Horace Farneze Duke of Caſtres, and the Ladie Diana his natural daughter, was moſt famous. But the Emperour prompt and actiue in his actions, pricked beſides with an extreame deſire of reuenge, which by all meanes in all places hee practiſed, ſoone troubled this good cheere, for in the beginning of the ſpring, with ſuch a number as hee was able to aſſemble, and firſt vnder the conduct of du Reux hee ſent to beſiege Terroanne. But preuented by death, that charge was giuen to Binecourt, a knight eſteemed one of the moſt ſweet &amp; gracious among them. That Citie, albeit that it was little of circuit, had a renowne great inough throughout all Europe, of which the Romanes make honorable

mention in their writings. It was ſcituated vpon the little riuer of Liz, in the confines of Gaul Belgique, a nation of a long time eſteemed warlyke by the hiſtoriographers, called by the Latins Morini, now they call it the Cauntie of Ponthieu ſomwhat neer the great Ocean ſea, in ſituation ſomwhat hanging, inuironed with fens &amp; mariſhes, woodes, and great forreſts. Beſides, curiouſly fortified by the Kinges of Fraunce, to whoſe handes it hath a long time ſince beene fallen, to ſerue them as a bulwarke and frontire as well againſt the Engliſh, as Flemings and Hanuiers, among which it is incloſed, hauing done a thouſand ſpoyles, and an hundred ſundrie enterpriſes, which they woulde attempt vpon Picardie. Wherefore it was once cleane rayſed and made euen to the earth by the Engliſhmen, and there was ſalt ſowen in ſigne of eternall ruine. But yet is it much more odious to the Flemings, Burgonians, and Hanuiers, who for this occaſion importunately induced the Emperour to this enterpriſe. Now forſomuch as it was eſteemed impregnable, &amp; that as well by intelligence, as other conſiderations not thought, that the Emperour woulde conuert his forces to that place, but rather into Champagne, towardes Mezieres and Yuoy, they had not ſo carefully furniſhed it with victuals &amp; ſure munition, as was requiſite for ſo long a ſiege. Whereof the neighbours being aduertiſed, the enemyes vſed ſo greate diligence, that it was ſodainly beſieged, De Loſſes beeing alone, within the principall and chiefe, with his light horſe and ſome people of the Country, in no great number, nor of anie great defence. Ioyn that thorough the couetouſnes and neglygence of former gouernours, a thing naturall to vs French men, this key remained bare and vnfurniſhed of all prouiſions: therefore it was neceſſarie to make a vertue of neceſsitie, &amp; where prudence could not take place, there it was neceſſarie that force ſhould ſecond it. In ſuch ſorte, as euen in the beard of the enemy, and in ſpight of them, being as men iudged for the moſt parte not vſed to the arte of warres, they ſtrengthned it with men, victuals, and whatſoeuer they were able. D'eſſe, otherwiſe called Panuilliers, knight of the order, moſt renoumed for his vertue and proweſſe, beeing ſent thether Lieutenant for the King, and with him Frances of Montmorencie, eldeſt ſonne to the Conſtable, with the moſt part of theyr companies, followed wyth a great number of other Lordes, Gentlemen and ſouldyers, who entered therein to ſeeke for honour: and the reſt following theyr Captaines to defend and keepe the place. But as ſuch a victualling thereof deſpighted the Emperor, and making him obſtinate, reiterated his deſpight, to cauſe it to bee battered and aſſaulted, the King contrarywiſe aſſuring himſelfe of an impoſſibilitie to force it, ſlacked it in ſuch ſort, as without anie other ſuccours or preparatiues, hee lefte his enemie to doo whatſoeuer hee liſted. For albeit that they wythin, and the Duke of Vendoſme wyth the men at armes of the garriſons about, impeached and gaue alarums vnto them as much as was poſsible, yet theyr number beeing much greater and ſtronger than the French, they could not ſo hinder them, but that they made their approaches, where they themſelues thought beſt euen to plant their batterie where they pleaſed, and knew might moſt annoy the towne, putting the verie mouth of theyr artillerie neereſt, and vpon the brinke of the ditch betweene the caſtle and the towre Du Chapitre, vppon a little hill where the gallowes ſtoode hard by. Hauing brought from many townes and caſtles of Flanders and Artois all ſortes of Artillerie, with innumerable munitions of pouder and bullets. So glad was that nation to ſee it inuironed, that not onely women and litle children ranne thether, but for ioy ſung ſongs, and vulgar rimes, carrying and bringing into the campe all ſortes of graine, drinkes, beaſts, and other victuals by heapes, which made their armie ſeeme farre greater in number; than well furniſhed of good ſouldiers.
            
               Theyr batterie began about the end of Iune, ſtraunge and furious inough: but albeit the bullets fell as thicke within the towne, as great haileſtones out of the skie, and that there was not vpon the rampires, thorough the ſtreets or within the houſes, any ſure place and without danger, yet they within beſieged were ſmally ſeared therewith. Now making continuall ſallies and recharges vpon their enemyes in the midſt of theſe thickes and ſmoakes, they ſought them out, and by heapes beate them within theyr owne forts and trenches, and ſometimes conſtrayned them to abandon theyr trenches, and had leaſure inough to ſticke vp ſome of theyr peeces with nayles, and ſet theyr pouder on fire, ſo as they dragged into the towne one of theyr culuerines, and after ſhot many ſhootes at them, albeit the great ſtore of artillerie and munition which was continually brought to the campe, hourely repayred anie diſorder or annoyance, which the French with great labour and daunger could doo them, being a farre greater loſſe to looſe one man beſieged, than ten beſieging. Vppon this the tempeſt and thundring batterie of the enemies grew greater dayly, &amp; there remained not within the towne, tower, or turret, to the leaſt battlement that fell not to the ground, there was not anie defence without or within, which they rayſed not. Briefly, in ſeeing it thus battered, &amp; throwen downe, one would eaſily beleeue that they determined to laie it all to duſt. They within without anie reſpect at all of theyr owne liues, to the ſame place whether they ſawe the bullets bend, from moment to moment carried vpon their backes earth, faggots, turfes, and dung, which notwithſtanding much weakned them by reaſon of the continuall toyle which they in the daie had to rampire, and in the night to watch, to keepe ſentinell, and ſuſtaine diuerſe alarums with litle reſt, for a neceſsitie practiſing the office of ſouldiers and labourers both together, by reaſon of the ſmall number of artificers and pioners, and leſſe ſtore of anie neceſſarie tooles that was in the towne at a pinch, as pickaxes, ſpades, ſhouelles, mattockes, crowes, and ſuch ſort of yron workes, whereof they ſtood in ſo great need, as the ſoldiers within were conſtrained to peck the ground with ſpits, daggers, fire ſhouels, and as a man maye ſaie, euen ſcratch it wyth their nailes: for which and ſuch like wantes, many townes in France haue bene gotten by the enemie, albeit that they were well furniſhed beſides for good men: for help whereof, and to giue ſome reioycing to the long trauell of the beſieged, they cauſed the Captain Grille to enter in with one hundred harguebuziers on horſebacke. The which hee brauely enterpriſed and executed, and with ſuch conduct, as hauing forced the watch, with ſmall loſſe of anie of his ſoldiers he entered in, in the ſight of them all, which greatly increaſed their courage. The ſame daie they made a ſallie in like ſorte out vpon them luckily inough; &amp; made their retreate like men of warre, without receiuing the worſe. But that nation ſhewed it ſelfe ſo greate an enemie to this poore miſerable towne, that ſhee forgot nothing whereby ſhee might make her extreame deſire appeare, of ſeeing the totall deſtruction therof, and how much by day &amp; night they ceaſed not to torment it, by all means which they could poſsiblie imagine, by ſo much more increaſed the courage of the French, to repulſe them backe, for in leſſe than one houre they had made vp the rampire without the ladder, where they perceiued the artillery to begin to ſhake the wal, and made ſtronger in an inſtant, what in one daie had beene throwen downe, then it was before. Notwithſtanding the lightning of their artillerie was ſo terrible and violent thundering without intermiſsion, as there was neither rampire, banke, nor defence which it turned not ouer without remedie, the which continued ſo furiouſlie for the ſpace of neere hand ten dayes together. Within which time the enemies ſuppoſing that they had made a breach reaſonable and great inough, as in deed it was of

threeſcore paces long, the wall, rampire, &amp; all the defences as well of the caſtle as the great tower being broken downe and battered, no more remaining but a litle mount which they within had cauſed to bee made, and the parapect and toppe of the ditch, which was yet ſtrong, and hard for them to mount vp vnto, notwithſtanding that as well with the quarters and ruines of the wall, as with faggots and hurdles, they dyd what they could to fill vp the ditch, to make the ſcale more eaſie. That beeing knowen to thoſe within, they reſolued to abide them, and you may eaſily beleeue that they lefte nothing in theyr lodgings that was not brought out. After many vollies of artillerie, as well from the mountaine, which gaue right on the backe of the beſieged, willing to defend the breach, as from that which ſhot in face of them on the riuer ſide, with a great noiſe of Fifes,A furious aſſault to Terroane by the Fleminges &amp; Hanuiers, helde out by the French. Drums, Trumpets, and diuerſe cries after theyr manner, they went furiouſly to the aſſault of all partes, carrying ladders and all kinde of engins to ſcale and force the towne, and there was that daie a moſt maruellous combat ſeen. For if the enemies were wilfull to enter in, much more had the French a better wil to defend themſelues and repulſe them. There could one haue ſeene nothing but wild fire, and vnquenchable crackling of armour, and al kinde of weapons, pittious cries of thoſe which were burned, maimed, turned ouer, and drawing towardes death: generally all ſortes of moſt terrible and furious executions, for the ſpace of more than ten long houres, the enemies refreſhing themſelues three times. In the end the reſolute conſtancie of the beſieged preuayled, and vanquiſhed the obſtinacy of the imperials, repulſing them with a great butcherie of theyr moſt braue men, not without greate loſſe of them that kept it, among whom the valiant Knight De Heſſe loſt his life, whoſe proweſſe was alreadie renowmed beyonde the frontiers of Fraunce in many places, namely in the Ilandes of England and Scotland, as alſo dyd De Viennes, De Beaudiſne, De la Rochepoſay, De Blandie, and the Captaine Ferriers, all men of marke, and of laudable conduct, with other valiant Gentlemen and ſouldiers.
            The King beeing aduertiſed how couragiouſly his men behaued themſelues, perſwaded himſelfe that to ſo victorious a beginning, there coulde not inſue but a moſt happie end,A ſtratageme of the Captaines, Breuill &amp; Saint Romain. without ordaining anie further ſuccours for this litle towne almoſt torne in peeces of all partes, ſauing onely that hee cauſed De Hedin, the Captaine Breuil, and S. Romain with about three hundred footmen, to aſſaie if they could enter in. Which they moſt fortunatly performed, not without great daunger and hazard of their perſons, the enemies hauing with theyr trenches and mounts compaſſed and inuironed the towne round about, euen ſo far as to place their Corps de gnets within the ditches, who being neuer a whit the more cooled nor diſcouraged for that, fought daylye hand to hand with the French which kept the breach, and grewe much more earneſt in returning vnto it, aſſaying by all force poſsible to carrie it awaie, and did not onelie giue fire to diuerſe hollow mines in ſundrie places, the moſt part whereof they found falſe and vented, but they beſide practiſed a ſlight neuer before vſed, which was to dig vnder the parapect and backe of the ditch, beeing verie hard and vneaſie to mount vp to the breach, all the flankers and defenſes (as I haue tolde you) being raiſed and broken downe with the artillerie, hauing made certaine Taudis, which they call Mancelets, in faſhion of blinders, onely to couer them from hand ſtrokes and ſtones, whileſt that they did approach to the foot of the breach, vnder which they hollowed &amp; trained, their mine as themſelues could deſire. Whereat the French maruelling inough, perſwaded themſelues that the enemies were not able to hollowe and dig ſo farre as vnder their feet, which were aboue them vpon the breach, but rather that they wold drawe out the earth from vnder the caſtle, or the great tower Du Chapitre, but contrariwiſe

they ſtill digged vnder the parapect, the length of the verie breach, holding vp the burthen with ſhores and piles, fylling the ditch full of the earth which they drew out. The worke being finiſhed, and fire put thereto, it happened that one parte of this parapect was blowen vp, and fel within the ditch, and the reſt ſunke in a heap, ſwallowing vp many French ſouldyers,Terroane ſurpriſed

Whereupon Frances of Montmorencie, according to the counſell of all the Captaines which were within with him, conſidering how there was no more meanes to defend the town or make anie reſiſtance, aduiſed at the leaſt how to ſaue the perſons, and demanded compoſition, which was graunted vnto him. But whileſt that they parlyed, the Germanes and Burgonians entered in at diuerſe places, and thereuppon the olde Spaniſh Enſignes ranne vp the great breach, crying, Faire warres, faire wars. Whereupon ſome French men drew to them with theyr pikes, and ſtretched out theyr handes vnto them to keepe them from beeing murthered by the Germanes.The crueltie of the Germanes &amp; Burgonians at the taking of Terroane. Nothing beeing able to bee otherwiſe concluded by this compoſition by reaſon of ſuch a ſurpriſall, where you might haue ſeene moſt ſtrange cruelties which the Germanes and Burgonians committed, ſpeaking of nothing but cutting of throats, ſo as the miſerable French men eſteemed themſelues moſt happie to fall priſoners into the handes of more gracious Lordes, from whoſe furie hardly could Frances de Montmorencie ſaue himſelfe, who onely remained there within lieutenant for the king, whom in ſeeking to couer and defend, D'ouartie was ſore ſet vppon and hurt in his preſence, yet afterwardes hee was knowen and carried priſoner to Binecourt, the Emperours Lieutenant.

But ſuch as tarryed tardie were knowen,The humanitie of the Spaniards towardes the French ſoldiers. and in great daunger there to abide by it long. The ſurplus of the ſouldiers found at the Spaniards hands (to whoſe mercie the moſt parte were fallen) an honeſt entertainment, taking of ſuch as had meanes reaſonable ranſome, and the poore hauing ſtript them of their weapons and beſt ſtuffe, they ſent backe ſafely, and oftentimes themſelues conducted them. Within this little towne was found a great deale of good and groſſe artillerie, chiefly two verie faire and long Culuerines.
            In this time the great Turke Sultan Soliman carryed himſelfe too rigorouſly towardes the perſon of Sultan Muſtapha his eldeſt ſonne, which he had of a ſlaue.Soliman the great Turke cauſeth his ſonne to be ſlaine. Who hauing beene ſent with his mother from his firſt youth into the prouince of Amafia, which was giuen vnto him, was ſo well and carefully brought vp, as hee there atchieued great honour and amitie, not onely of all in that Countrie, but thoroughout all the gouernments of his Father. This mother beeing abſent; Soliman tooke another ſlaue vnto him named Roza, of whome hee had foure other ſonnes, Mahomet, Baiazet, Selim, Giangir the crooke backe, and one daughter, which was marryed to Baſſa Roſtan. Roza being indued with admirable beautie, accompanyed with all the flattering delights and allurements which poſsibly one could imagine,Religion lightl

                   a colour for anie villanie. knewe ſo well howe to plaie her part towardes Soliman, who was as it were a man rauiſhed, that by the helpe of Muchthy (as much to ſaie, as the ſoueraigne Prieſt of the lawe of Mahomet) and vnder colour of religion, ſhee was not onely made free of condition, but lawfull wife &amp;

ſpouſe of Soliman, to which neuer anie before her attayned. Raiſed now vnto ſuch honour, and ſeeing her ſelfe entirelie beloued, ſhe had no greater care than how to eſtabliſh the Empire vnto one of her children after the death of the father. But foreſeeing that the ſingular vertues of Muſtapha would bee ſo farre contrarie thereunto, that whileſt hee liued ſhee ſhould neuer haue reſt, (becauſe that he had gotten the loue of the men of warre, and how the eyes of all men were vppon him, for the great hope of his magnanimious courage and ſingular dexteritie) ſhe ſtudyed as much as ſhe could to make him become odious to Soliman, to which her ſonne in law greatly aided her, for that hee as then gouerned all the affayres. Her reaſons were, how that Muſtapha building vppon the loue and fauour which hee had gotten of all men, thorough his great liberalitie, courage, &amp; dexteritie of ſpirit, burned with ſuch a longing to raigne, as euerie man feared leaſt in affecting the Empire, hee would ſhorten the dayes of Soliman, as alreadie Selim had done to his father. Therefore ſhee vrged Soliman, and beſought him with many and great teares that hee would take order therein, thereby to prouide for his owne ſafetie. Now albeit in the beginning ſhee ſmally preuailed, and that Muſtapha had well diſcouered the croſſebarres which ſhee ordinarilye prepared for him, yet ſhee neuer ceaſed to continue, by the helpe of a Iew, a moſt renowmed inchantreſſe, who hauing giuen vnto her certaine drugs, ſhee cauſed the amitie of Soliman to bee redoubled towards Roza, ſo well, as ſhe aſſured her ſelfe of a good euent at the laſt to her enterpriſes, albeit a delaie might bee for a time. Finally, after many practiſes, ſhee found meanes to ſuborne the gouernour of Muſtapha, and cauſed him to write (though falſely) vnto Soliman, howe his ſonne meant to take in marriage the daughter of the Kinge of Perſia. This olde man moued by the continuall plaintes of Roza and Roſtan, eaſily gaue credite to theſe newes and falſe aduertiſements, ſo as in the yeere 1552. hauing cauſed a bruite to runne of the Perſians comming downe into Syria, hee ſent Roſtan thether with a puiſant armie, for (vnder colour of going to meete with his enimies) to ceaze vpon Muſtapha, and bring him priſoner to Conſtantinople, with expreſſe commaundement to kill him, if otherwiſe hee coulde not take him. But Muſtapha aduertiſed of the whole matter, and howe that the Perſians were not at all in the field, came towardes him with ſeuen thouſand men of the beſt experienced in the warres, which cauſed Roſtan to make a quicke returne without dooing ought. Whereat Soliman beeing the more prouoked, the next yeere cauſed the ſame bruite agayne to runne, and how hauing leauied a great armie he meant to go himſelf in perſon agaynſt the Perſians. Beeing arriued in Syria, hee commanded his ſonne to come vnto him to his campe. Muſtapha knowing how it was him alone which they ſhot at, albeit hee was prayed and greatly ſolicited to auoide the furie of his Father, and retire himſelf into ſome other part, truſting in his owne innocencie, and thinking it a matter more commendable and worthie of his greatneſſe, to die in obeying of his Father, than liuing, to incurre a note of infamie and treaſon, yea, though thereby hee, might gaine the Empire of the whole world: thinking in like ſorte, that for that he neuer made anie refuſal, by his owne preſence hee might appeaſe the furie of his father went on his waie thether, but being entered within Solimans tent, hee was ſodainly taken and ſtrangled in his owne preſence, after at the ſame inſtant, the Baſſa his head of the Prouince of Amaſia, was ſtroke off. This crueltie beeing come to the knowledge of Giangir, the crooke backe, one of the reſt of the foure brothers, hee manfully reiected the gifte and ſpoile which his father had preſented vnto him, ſo that lamenting the death of his brother, he could not command himſelfe, nor refrain from vttering theſe ſpeeches.
            
               
               Ha cruell Traitor, I cannot ſay Father, take now to thy ſelfe the treaſures, the Horſes, the Tapistrie, and the Prouince of Muſtapha, and gouerne it at thyne owne pleaſure: could it fall into thy thought O infamous man! and without humanitye, to cauſe to dye againſt all lawe, ſo valiant a perſonage as neuer was nor neuer will be the like in all the houſe of Ottomans? Ha, ha, it ſhall not bee true, and I will take order, that thou ſhalt neuer bee able impudentlye to vaunte, that euer thou didſt the like to me poore Crookebacke: and at the inſtant drawing out his dagger, hee ſtabbed himſelfe ſo farre into the bodye, as hee fell downe ſtarke dead, which being knowne to his Father, hee maruelouſlye mourned, and notwithſtanding he ſpared not to ſeaſe of all his goods, which cauſed a great tumulte in Muſtapha his Campe, but it was nothing in reſpect of that they did after they vnderſtoode of his death. In ſuch ſorte as Solyman with great daunger of his life, was conſtrained to baniſhe Roſtan, and depriue him of all honors and dignities. This death fell out very fortunatelye for the Chriſtians, to whome Muſtapha was a ſore enemye, and tooke ſingular pleaſure in ſhedding of their blood: it was likewiſe taken ſo greeuouſlye of the Turkes, that from thence forth this prouerbe is growne among them, Gietti Sultan Muſtapha, all is ended ſince that hee is dead, all is done whatſoeuer we thought of: for they imagined in their own fancie that it was he which ſhould enlarge the bounds of their Empire in another manner of ſorte then euer did his Anceſtors, which they could not expect at the handes of any other.
            Let vs handle againe the ſiege of Teroene.
            The Emperour lying at Bruxelles, and being promptlye aduertiſed of the taking of Teroene, conceaued a verye great pleaſure thereat,Teroene razed to the foundation by the Emperours commandement. ſweetening by the happe of this good fortune, the bitterneſſe of his former diſgraces, ſo as throughout all the Countryes of Flaunders, Arthois, and Henaute were ſeene great bonfyers. Afterwards he commanded that it ſhould be razed and throwne down to the very foundations, to the end nought might reſt but the place, where it might be ſayd Teroene had beene. Afterwardes hee ſent the Prince of Piemont his Nephewe Lieutenant generall in his armye, to quenche a ſedition and a certaine enuye which the Princes and great Lordes bare to Binecourt a worthy Cheefe of theſe troupes. But ſuch is the malice among men, that it was neuer, nor euer ſhall bee, but that enuye will bee among equalles, albeit that often tymes it maye lye diſſembled.
            The King vnderſtoode of theſe ſorrowfull newes as ſoone as the Emperour, which at the inſtant ſeemed as ſtrange vnto him, as any thing which they could haue made reporte of, conſidering how hee had before receiued an entire contentment of that furious aſſaulte which the French had ſo reſolutely ſuſtained: but being certified by diuers reportes how all the matter was handled, hee was greatlye greeued at the taking thereof, and much more bewayled his men, which he thought to be in a farre greater number dead, then afterwardes it was found to be. Now albeit that among the French the plainte was great, and the loſſe very preiudiciall, yet neceſsitye (the inuentreſſe and miſtreſſe of all Artes) ſharpning the wits of men to aſſay ſtrange things, ſtirred vp the Kings ſpirit in a ſorte, ioynte with the ſorrowe and greefe of the loſſe, ſo that being aduertiſed how his enemies ſhortlye after this ruyne took their way, and prepared themſelues to come and do as much at Hedin, he made ready all preparatiues to fortifie the ſame with men, and all thinges fitting to ſtaye them ſhorte, or at the leaſt vntill ſuch a time as hee imagined his armye coulde be

in a readines, to the end to raiſe the ſiege and driue them into their owne Countrie. Now the D. of Bouillon Marſhall of France, deſirous more and more to perſeuer in the K. ſeruice,The D. of Bouillon within Hedin, Lieutenant for the King. had long time before vndertaken the defence of this Caſtle, to which would needes accompany him Horace Farneze D. of Chaſtres, and the Earle of Villars, with a great number of other Lords, Gentlemen, and good Souldiers, who to make proofe of their courage, of their own accord preſented themſelues to this ſeruice, albeit that the K. ſtoode in ſome doubt of the force and validitie of that place, and had no affection at all to expoſe thither ſuch perſonages of ſuch authoritie: they notwithſtanding preferring an immortall renowne before their goods or liues, went to encloſe themſelues within this forte: to this verye ende were diſpatched couriers and commandements to the Captaines of the men of warre, to haue in readines all their companies, and as ſoone as it were poſsible to cauſe them to march and to render themſelues neere Amyens, where the Conſtable was, hoping to aſſemble together there the Kings army, commiſsions were diſtributed to the Captaines of the Fanterie, to make their leuies as ſoone as they were able, and to thoſe of the olde Enſignes, and entertained companies to furniſh them compleate, and wel armed to conduct them ſurely, and without plaints vnto the Rendeuous: there was alſo proclaimed throughout all the Realme, that the Rirebands according to their dutie, and the Kings ordinance, ſhould forthwith march and furniſh themſelues to the ſame place, afterwards they aduertiſed and beſought the Zuizer cantons of the French league, to ſend to their ſuccour a certaine number of footemen of their nation, the beſt armed and compleate that they could, according to the agreement between the Kings of Fraunce and them. The King in ſumme cauſed great diligence to be made, and commaunded that all thinges ſhould be prouided for the putting of his power into the fielde,Great diligence vſed by the imperials to beſiege Hedin. where his enemies being aduertiſed and well aſſured, that if they did not imploy that ſmall time which they could get, (within which the Kinges army might be made readye) ſo to purpoſe as they might enforce Hedin, hardly they ſhould attaine to the cheefe of their enterpriſe, or retire without a battaile, or other peiudiciall accident: they aduaunced with ſuch diligence their affaires, that the Towne being voide of inhabitants, (who were fled and retired into France with whatſoeuer they could carry away of their goods) was in very ſhort time taken by them, in reſpect it was not much defended by Souldiers, who ſhutte vp themſelues within the Caſtle, eſteeming it impregnable. There they planted on the one ſide one of their batteries, and the other towards the parke, and the greateſt of all by the Towre Robin, where the French had already made theirs, but notwithſtanding any reſiſtance which they within beſieged were able to make, they were not able to diuerte them. This Caſtle being little, which in al could contain but 2000. men, and that hardly hauing in times paſt beene builded by the Dukes of Burgondie, onely for the pleaſure of hunting, &amp; not to fortifie it in any ſort, ſo not looſing one ſole hower by day or night to batter it ſo furiouſlye as was poſſible, they trauailed not onelye to throwe it downe by their artillerie, but vndermined it ſo diuerſlye and in ſo many places, that it was impoſsible that a Cony berry could haue more holes and hollowes vnder the ground, then were vnder the foundations of this caſtle,Hedin beſieged, battered, vndermined, taken, and ſacked by the Imperials. all the countermines &amp; ſecrets within being known &amp; practiſed by many of the enemies, the place beſides being very ſubiect to this imperfection. Now the enemies had already battered and digged downe the greateſt parte of the parapette and rampire of the great breach, where a great number of valiant men remayned, and alreadye giuen a falſe aſſaulte, when

all the dangers were declared to the D. of Bouillon, and withall the irrecouerable loſſe of ſo many braue men as were within ſo vile a place, the taking of Teroane ſeruing them for a freſh example, without compariſon farre ſtronger then that Caſtle, wherefore of euerye ſide were propoſed termes of compoſition, the which the Prince of Piemont willingly enough agreede vnto, ſtanding aſſured how the chieftaines which defended that place were men of valour, and the ſouldiers full cunning at ſuch an occupation, conſidering likewiſe that the time was very ſhort to make any long temporiſing, curious beſides to get good cheape, whereby afterwards he might the better imploy his army to matter of greater conſequence. But as the Gentlemen and Trumpetters went from the one ſide to the other, to reſolue of the compoſition already in good forwardnes, nothing reſting but the deliuerye of hoſtages on both ſides, and the ſigning with the Princes hand, two misfortunes happened to the French: the one, that a Prieſt not wittingly as ſince it was knowne, but through lack of foreſight or ſome ſecret malediction, ſet on fire ſuch workes and preparations as they had made ready to abide the aſſault: the other, that the Bourgonians greedy of the pray, by the ſweetenes which they found in the ſacke of Teroane, gaue fire to the traines of their mines, fearing to be fruſtrate of ſo great a bootie as they expected: ſo as one parte of the Souldiers being burned and conſumed in theſe fires, another ſwallowed vp and periſhed in this gulfe of ſmoaking mines, the reſt which were a very fewe aſtonied as if they had fallen from the cloudes, without daring to make any reſiſtance, in reſpect they were forbidden to ſtirre from their places, or moue theyr weapons, attending the Princes ſigning and confirmation, were ſurpriſed and found themſelues at the mercy of their enemies, before they euer thought them as yet to haue bene entred. The Prince of Piemont knowing this aduenture ſo happely fallen out for him and better thē he hoped for, would not afterwards ſigne what he had before promiſed, forgetting all the precedents, through the ioy which he had for the recouering of that place, and the priſonners at ſo eaſie a rate. So as preſently mounting vp the great breach, he entred the Caſtle to goe to the D. of Bouillon, who as ſoone as hee perceiued him, moued with an extreame choller, which made him forget all feare of death, ſaid vnto him: why how now Sir, is this the keeping of your promiſe? will you not ſend ſuch hoſtages vnto me as you promiſed, and perfourme what is agreede betweene you and me? to whom the Prince anſwered with a ſmile, ſufficient teſtimony of his ioy, how that he had ſpoken too late, and how it was no more needfull to giue hoſtages when all his people were already within. In ſumme, that after many ſpeeches the reſolution was, that they ſhould remaine priſonners, to wit, the D. of Bouillon cheefe and lieutenant for the K. De Riou Gouernour, La Lobe Enſigne of the Dukes company, the Earle of Vilars, De Prie Lieutenant of his company, De Guenon guidon, De Vanze Marſhall of the lodgings, the Baron of Culan, De Marets Lieutenant of De Riou his company of foot, with ſundry other, whome ſeeing by apparance to be of ſome mark, he would needs haue their names, and afterwards more raunſome then otherwiſe he had: ſo this Caſtle was againe recouered by the imperials the 18. of Iuly, after the death of Horace Farneze D. of Caſtres, whom a bullet of a great peece carried away, and hard by him De Magny a renowned gentleman in the feates of armes, there died alſo the Vicecount of Martigues,Horace Farneze D. of Caſtres, De Magny, the Vicount of Martigues, Moninuille Cizieux, Dampierre, Luſignan, and others dead at Hedin. who being deliuered out of priſon at Teroane, preſently repaired to this caſtle, hauing alwaies ſpent his time in many honourable actions: Moninuille of the houſe of Amboiſe, de Cizeux Cōmiſsioner of the wars, the C. Luſignan enſigne to De Riou, De Dampierre, who had likewiſe beene priſonner at Teroane, and came againe thither with the Seneſchall of Caſtres, and

Captaine Vifargent, who were ſunke within the Mynes, the Captaine Maleſtrot Lieutenant to Maugeron, the Captaine Morarque, captaine of a company of footmen, and the Captaine Coq Enſigne of Captaine Cerf his company of foot, were there ſlaine among the firſt in the baſe towne. The Emperour moſt ioyfull of the taking thereof, commanded that with all diligence they ſhould cauſe the Caſtle to be razed, but K. Henry much more redoubled his former ſorrow, being enforced notwithſtanding to run to the moſt expedient remedy, albeit there was before no other brute throughout all Fraunce, then leauying of men of warre, and all the waies couered ouer with Souldiers, he ſent againe to haſten all his companies, and in as ſhort time as was poſſible to make ready his army to hinder them from doing any other enterpriſe, thinking it ſure that they would as they threatned to Dourlans (where the Vidaſme of Chartres was) a Caſtle of leſſe ſtrength then Hedin, which the late King Francis had cauſed to be dreſſed vp with earth, to ſerue for a bulwarke and counterfort to Hedin, at ſuch time as it was enemy: therfore on all ſides poſtes flew about to ſollicite this preparation. As touching the men of armes and French cauallerie, they were by &amp; by ready and on foote, as well in hauing bene placed in garriſons, as for the commoditie and leaſure which was giuen to the men at armes, to looke for a little time into their domeſticall affaires. The French fanterie was likewiſe very glad to be ioyned together, the olde Enſignes being compleate in their garriſons, and places ordained, with ſuch good order as the new captaines had ſet downe to make ſuddainly their leuies, and thorough the aduertiſement which they had giuen to their Souldiers to be ready at the firſt warning, as for the Germanes and Lansknets, ſuch as the K. had retained for his ſeruice, hauing alwaies bene entertained and paide were already in the fielde, ſo in very few daies and about the beginning of the moneth of Auguſt. the K. campe grew far greater &amp; greater, about Amiens and Pequegny, none remaining but the Zuizers and Griſons,The French army aſſembled neere Amiens and Pequigny. who as well for abiding far of, as being of themſelues heauy and maſſie, came but by ſmal iournies, eſpecially to the end they might not be tyred, whē they ſhould arriue at the campe, but be freſh and prompt to fight ſuddenly if need ſo required: therefore they arriued not before the end of that moneth: after the taking of Hedin all the time while the K. army aſſembled, the imperials did nothing els then raze it to the ground, and employ themſelues to robberies, and burning of Villages all alongſt the riuer of Authia: and albeit that they had ſummoned the Caſtle of Orlan, and ſpread a brute that they ment to beſiege it, they made no ſemblant thereof for all that, nor that they were willing to attempt any new matter, vntill about the 13. of that moneth, when, hauing had aduertiſements how the Conſtable had cauſed 4. enſignes of the French fanterie, and 2. companies of light horſe to paſſe ouer the riuer of Some, they determined with 4. regiments of their caualery to ſurpriſe, and defeate them ſo readilye, that as they would haue executed the enterpriſe before that thoſe which were about Amiens ſhould be aduertiſed thereof: it fortuned that the Conſtable had addreſſed the ſame day another party to go viſit them as farre as their owne Campe, Paul Baptiſta hauing commiſſion to paſſe the riuer with 50. horſe to attacke the skirmiſh, and draw thē to fight, the D. of Neuers remaining in ambuſcade, with 3. companies of light horſe, in a wood vpon the banke of the riuer of Authia, who finding himſelfe at any time to be ouermatched, had Sanſac to reſcue him, who was behinde half a league of, with 5. other light cōpanies, the Prince of Conde was a quarter of a league on the right hand of him with 3. light cōpanies: likewiſe the Marſhall of S. Andre with 500. men at armes, a mile farther behinde towards the campe, the conſtable being halfe way between al his companies and the riuer, accompanied

with 4000. horſe, as wel of companies as Rirebands, and 20. enſignes of Fanterie, half French and halfe Lansknets, and 4. feelde peeces, but eaſing the French of the paines to goe ſeeke them out, they approched neere the Marſhall S. Andre, hauing lefte all their light Caualerie behinde them, ſo as three hundred horſecouriers ruſhed euen vpon the Conſtable without diſcouering any of the ambuſcades. Hereupon Sanſac his light Cauallerie began the skirmiſh neereſt to the Marſhals ambuſcade, where the French were borne downe, and rudelye put backe euen to the hindermoſt man, ſo as they tooke two priſoners, who tolde them that the Conſtable was not aboue a quarter of a league of with all his forces, the which cauſed them to haſten to giue the charge vpon the companies of the D. of Vendoſme and of Sanſac, who at the ſame inſtant was couered and charged by an other thouſand horſe, and vpon this medley the Marſhall began to march with a great trot right towardes them, which quicklye ſtayed them, and by and by they diſcouered the Prince of Conde in ſet battaile galloping to ioyne vpon them, whom as ſoone as they ſaw, they put themſelues in ſuch diſarray, as being recharged onely with fiftie helmets, they were put to flight: for the Prince of Conde ſo roughly ſet vpon them, as he and his company purſued them a long League, where were ſlaine of theirs betweene 7. and 8. hundred men, among whome there was found of renowne the Earle D'eſpinoy, and other great Lordes of the low Countries, ſeauen as well Enſignes as Guidons gained,The D. of Aſco
                     •
                   priſonner. neere 500. priſonners in number, among whom the D. of Aſcot was found. On the French part for men of reputation, the ſonne of Canaples, and of La Roche Guion, and the Guidon of Sanſac, remained there priſonners, with ſome other ſouldiers, eſpecially of the light cauallery, not any great number either taken or ſlaine.
            This reencounter ſo happily executed, greatly quailed the courage of the imperials, who ſince did no matter of importance, for incontinentlye after they departed from Beauqueſne, where they were encamped, ſo as hauing razed the towre and the forte, they came by great iournyes as farre as Ancre &amp; Miraumont, within 4. leagues of Peronne, French lands, where hauing put to the fire, and lodged ten Enſignes of their braueſt men within Bapaulme, thinking that according to the common brute, the firſt fury of the French would be there diſcharged, without making any longer ſtay, the body of their army retyred towards Arras, which was not as then very great or puiſſant, for many of them eſpecially of the borderers of Artois and Henaulte, retired to their owne houſes, to gather together the beſt of their goods, and encloſe it within ſtrong townes, or hide it in ſure and ſecret places, knowing that the Kings armie was all compleate, and was to put into the fielde within a fewe dayes, the which in the end of Auguſt was aſſembled to gether neere to Corbie;The French army in the field. and the firſt of September the Enſignes of Fraunce were diſplaied about the little towne with a mighty great number of men, the which the K. would needs ſee vpon a little mount, eſpecially the Zuizers, now they ſet their battailes in ſuch ordinance, as they caried the priſe ouer many nations, a thing which maruelouſly was agreeable &amp; pleaſing vnto him: The Conſtable being generall of the army, and the firſt cheefe in the auantgarde, was accompanied with the Princes &amp; Dukes of Vendoſme, Neuers, Anguien, Montpē
               ſier, and the Admirall: each one of theſe Princes hauing a regiment of men at armes, which is of 200. men at arms, and ouer which they cōmanded 49. enſignes of French ſundry, making vp the number between 15. &amp; 16000. men, of whom Chaſtillon Admirall of France was generall, the Earle Reingraue colonell of the Lanſeknets, with Reiſberg had 4. regiments, which are 20. enſignes, making the nūber between 10. &amp; 12000. men, foure Enſignes of Scottes, and two of Engliſh, amounting betweene twelue

and fifteene hundred men. Sanſac was the principall chiefe of the light Cauallerie, neere to two thouſand horſe, comprehending therein three or foure hundred Engliſh men, braue men, and well skilled in this occupation. The nobles and rierbandes were compleat verie neere three thouſand horſe, whereof La Iaille was generall, there were few of the particular companies of harguebuziers on horſebacke, for that the King had a little before made an ordinance therupon, to euery Captaine of one hundred men at armes, to leauie fiftie harquebuziers on horſebacke, armed with corſlets, murrions, vanbraces, or ſleeues of maile, with an handgunne or harquebuze, or a firelocke or cocke, within a caſe of well tanned leather, mounted vppon good curtailes, and vnto euerie one of fiftie,A new ordinance of harquebuſiers mounted. fiue and twentie in like equipage, conducted by a man at arms of the greateſt experience, eſpecially to that end to be choſen out of their own companie: all which made wel vp the number of twelue or fifteen hundred. A thing well inuented and by good counſell, to aſsiſt a man at armes in anie narrow or vneaeaſie place, and which gaue great countenance and grace to the armie, in beeing the firſt before the companyes, together with the diuerſitie of theyr apparell. In this battell was king Henrie neere vnto him, the Prince of Ferrara, the Duke of Guiſe, the prince of La Roche-Suryon, and the marſhall Saint Andre, euerie one of theſe princes hauing a regiment of men at armes as the reſt. The great Eſcuyer de Boiſi, and Canaples, wyth theyr bandes of the royall houſe, and the guardes as well French and Scots, as Suizers, and a number of great Lordes and Gentlemen following the King, as well in reſpect of their fidelitie, as to make knowen vnto him theyr vertue and good will. Of all ſortes of artillerie there was about one hundred great and ſmall peeces, ouer which Eſtre was great maſter and chiefe gouernour, a Gentleman verie watchfull and of great ſpirite, for the firſt daie of this voyage the armie made no great treate, incamping that night a league of Corbie in two little villages, vpon a current and ſmall riuer, beeing verie commodious for the ſame. The next morrow it followed almoſt the tracke and waie of the imperiall armie, to lodge at Miraumont, it happened that in the waie the Duke of Neuers ſlipped out of the armie with his regiment, taking the left hand towards the woods and forreſts, ouer agaynſt Arras, where ſome ſcoutes were diſcouered, who ſaued themſelues by theyr ſwiftneſſe within the thick of thoſe forreſts, which beeing well looked about, there was not one enimie found that made head, onely a fort within a lyttle village, which a lyttle after was forced by the harguebuziers, and found worſe prouided than they imagined. The which cauſed him to turne to Miraumont, to take his quarter. The ſecond of September the D. of Guiſe with two regiments of men at armes, between a thouſand and twelue hundred horſe as well of the light cauallerie as of the nobles, and ten Enſignes of French fanterie departed from the place, drawing thorough the rout of thoſe woods towards Arras, to diſcouer and cleere the moſt dangerous places, &amp; ſubdue the forces of any which ſhould be retired thither, but he found not ought which was hard vnto him, hauing diſcouered as far as the ſuburbs of Arras. So returning for a teſtimonie of this voyage, fire was ſet on al the villages round about, with a deſolation and moſt lementable pitie.Bapaulme repreſented. Now from Miraumont there were but two good leagues to Bapaulme, a ſtrong place, barren more thorough the ſcituation of nature, than anie workemanſhip, but much more odious and hurtful to the French bordering vpon it, than euer Terroane was to the Bourgonians, ſo as ſecretly the better to know the place, and tempt the reſolution of thoſe that held it, the thirde of September the Conſtable with the moſt parte of the Princes, accompanied with fiue thouſand horſe, &amp; as many of the French fanterie, went to view this place as neere as he was able, whereof Huntſimond a knight

was Gouernour, (much eſteemed of among the Bourgonians) furniſhed with ten or twelue Enſignes of Fantaſsins, and three or foure hundred horſe, who at the firſt fight did not any waies ſhew himſelfe ſparing of powder and bullets, beſides they within ſhewed themſelues very ſlacke and loath to come out to the skirmiſhe, but as farre as the Bullets of their artillerie might play, they kept a loofe of, and perfourmed their dutie brauely enough almoſt foure houres, while the skirmiſh laſted. In theſe light reencounters there were hurt the Captaine Breul with a Harquebuze ſhotte in the thigh, and yong Molimont Sonne to Molimont the Gouernor of Saint Dizier and of Nogent, who afterwards dyed at Peronne: during the skirmiſh the Admiral with a ſmal company went round about the place, and found it pregnable, the rampier being of bad ſtuffe, and the faſtening wherewith it was made but a thinne crumpled ſand, which is no good earth. But the greateſt difficultie of all was the remediles neceſsitie of water, albeit that the Conſtable had cauſed a great number of Pyoners to ſeeke out Conduit heads and ſprings, but no vaines of any laſting could be found out, ſo the determination of the ſiege was broke of and put ouer vntill another time: during this lingering there arriued at the Court the Cardinall of Saint George, being a Legate from the Pope to treate of a peace or truce betweene theſe two Princes: At their departure hence, all the Villages, Abbaies and manſion places appertaining to the enemy, not ſo much as ſparing the windmilles neere to the gates of Bapaulme, being partely conſumed, and the reſt as yet of a flame and ſmoking, the ground and waies grew ſo durtie and ſlipperie, by reaſon of a whole day and nights raine, that the Souldiers and footmen could hardly get to their other lodging, named Morlincourt within two ſmall leagues of Peronne: and the waggons and baggage ſuſtained no leſſe, whereof as well the garriſon of Bapaulme, as the reſt of the Peſantes about got good booties, ſpoyling the moſt ſcattered and worſt conuoyed ſorte of them: the imperiall armie in the meane time coaſted them within fiue or ſixe leagues, hauing the riuer as a barre and ſeparation betweene them, albeit it was farre leſſe then the French; for firſt euen at the noſe of the imperiall Campe, the French went and burned and ſet fire on the Villages next vnto them, in reſpect of the fewe alarmes which they gaue vnto the French, except it were ſometimes vpon their vallets and fouragers, the which they rather ſuppoſed grew by the ſpoyled and deſperate Peſants, then by the men of warre: and leſſe hurt was done to the victualers &amp; prouiſions brought into their Campe, all victuals being at a competent rate in the middeſt of an enemies Countrie, where they found nought but Granges voide of Corne and fourage, all ſorte of victuals being already tranſported and withdrawne into the ſtrong holdes. The which being come vnto the Kings knowledge,The deſſein of Charles 5. Emperour againſt the French. and ſufficiently foreſeeing that his enemy hoped and attended nought els then to make him temporiſe about ſome towne or other enterpriſe of ſmall conſequence, to drawe him on vntill the ſeaſon of raynes, which beginneth ſoone enough in the colde and occidentall Countryes, to the end to ruine and weaken him, as well in cutting of all his victuals, as by diſeaſes and coldes, afterwards to giue him battaile vpon his aduantages, concluded with his Councell to giue remedy thereto. The reſolution then was to reduce his enemy into two extremeties, the one of which he perſwaded himſelfe was vnpoſsible for him to ſhunne, and perhaps yeeld to them both: either to hold his forces cloſe together for the meeting of a battaile, or to ſeperate them for the defence of ſo many of his places, vncertaine which of them all ſhould be firſt attempted by the King, conſidering the ſecret of his deſſein, and the variable turning of his army, without any apparant reſolution of the place whether it would turne head, vpon which perſwading

himſelfe of the aduantage of the firſt, and that the Emperour durſt not hazard a generall combate, conſidering he had not ſo many men as himſelfe, and that they were more then halfe tired with the long time that they had remained in the fielde, hee thoroughly reſolued to get by force, ſleight, or any other meane: the firſt place hee ſhould attempt, and to ſacke it, and ruine the whole countrie about in the eye of the Maiſter, and ſo to returne in triumph, as hauing braued and cauſed him to refuſe the day in his owne Countrie, and whereof he had vaunted himſelfe to be the firſt challenger. Charles on the other ſide meaſuring his aduantage rather by the valour then number of his people, ſupplying otherwiſe the long weariſomnes of theſe trauailes of warre, by diſcretion of well chooſing his aduantage, rather then to accept of battaile, no leſſe aſſured himſelfe to make vaine the attempts of the French in any place which they ſhould goe about to beſiege; alwaies prouided that his would haue the patience to ſuffer the firſt heate of the French, a little to euaporate as into ſmoake, knowing that Henry notwithſtanding the better to preuaile therein, made account to ſound Cambray, as well for that the taking thereof would be an example to ſundrye other of renowne, as thinking to prouoke the imperials rather to battaile, then that they would loſe ſuch a place, in which eſpecially he knew his owne credite not to be ſo deepely rooted, but that for a ſmall matter the inhabitants would ſhake of the yoke which not long before he had impoſed of them: ioyne that the towne hauing beene alwaies Neuters, ſuch occurrents might ſo happen, as he might make it partaker with him, or at the leaſt fauourable, if they would aſsiſt to the recouering of their auncient liberty, conſidering that in terming it ſelfe Neuter, it was not lawfull for him to haue any greater authoritie ouer it then the King, and the rather for that the magiſtrates and popular ſorte began to feele themſelues outraged by the vſurpation which he had made ouer them (hauing proceeded ſo farre to his own aduantage, as to build a citadell to keep them in ſubiection) he feared leaſt they would euen make plaine onuerture to the King, being as then the ſtronger. In ſumme, if the Imperialles ſhewed themſelues of good courage, the French cauſed no other brute to runne, but of the deſire they had to battaile, and how the King ſought no other occaſion then ſuch as the place and time yeelded vnto him: to wit, being there at hand in ſo large and ſpatious a plaine, to preſent battaile, or to ſummon the Towne according to the accord of neutralitie, to make him onuerture, and giue him victuall, or proclaime it as his enemy: and ſo not farre from that place neere to Peronne, the French were encamped a two little leagues from Cambray. And the next morrow by break of day the King cauſed his army to be ſet in order of battaile ready to fight, ſending a herald of armes to ſummon the towne of her duety, ſignifying vnto them that he was not come thither to oppreſſe them, but rather to reſtore and ſettle them in their auntient libertye, which he well knew had beene already corrupted by the Emperour, of which if they would be reuenged and leaue that bondage, they could not haue better meanes then by his comming, that if the Emperour would quarrell for other aduantages, hee was there in perſon both to declare, and fight with all his forces to the contrary: if they did otherwiſe, they would be an occaſion of much miſcheefe to themſelues; firſt in loſing the title and priuiledge of being called Neuters, which is not affectionate to either the one or the others quarrels, by which meanes they had onely obtained the liberty to be able to traffique in both their Countries. Moreouer they ſhould thereby exempt their Countrie round about from the miſeries of the warre, otherwiſe they ſhould remaine for euer ſubiect to impoſts, loanes, ſubſidies, and all other manner of exactions, and be beſides that in danger to be partaker of the ſundrye trauayles

whereto a particular Country is abandoned and accuſtomed to ſuffer for his Prince. In ſumme they demaunded twiſe foure and twenty houres of the King to be aduiſed thereof, and to yeelde their anſwere, ſo the King cauſed his Campe to retyre a great league further backe, being lodged at Creuaecaeur, of the appertenances of the Queene, and it was proclaimed thoroughout the whole armye, that vpon a great paine of corporall puniſhment no man ſhould dare take ought within the territorye of Cambray without paying for the ſame. During this delay the Emperours partye within Cambray certified him of this ſummons, as then lying at Breuxelles, who to comforte and releeue them with hope and courage, ſet downe many thinges vnto them: among the reſt that they helde of the Chamber of the Empire, and that hee was the Emperour to defend and protect them, not a King of Fraunce who ſought nothing but their ruine; ſo as hauing ſet before their eyes the example of Metz, hee promiſed the deputies that in caſe they ſhould be beſieged, hee would ſuccour them by all meanes whatſoeuer. And from thence gaue order to the Prince of Piemont, who was gotten with his army towards Valenciennes, that hee ſhould yeelde vnto them as much ſuccour as they would demaund, or well needfull for them, ordaining thereto for cheefe and principall Gouernours the Earls of Boſſu and Brabanſon. The time of delay being expired, albeit the King knew well all theſe newes,Their anſwere of Cambray to the King. yet hee ſent againe to ſummon them to knowe their reſolution, but they ſent worde that if it might ſo pleaſe his Maieſtie they were all content to remaine his humble neighbors and freends, no waies refuſing to giue him victuals, but that as yet they were not maſters ouer their owne goods, for that the Emperor ſpight of their teeth had put men and great garriſons into their towne, wherefore it was cleane out of their libertye and power to be able to diſpoſe of any more. Vpon this anſwere and mylde excuſe the towne was adiudged for enemy, and the ſame day being the eight of September, the Conſtable with two regiments of men at armes,Skirmiſhes before Cambray. and 3. or 400. light horſe and Rirebands, followed by the Admirall with ten Enſigns of French fantery, went to prie and view round about, but in ſteede of hearing the crowing of Poultrie before, now nothing was heard but Cannons, harquebuze ſhot, and noyſe of all partes, eſpecially from the cytadell, which made the earth to tremble with the artillerie ſhot, wherewith they played vpon the French ſouldiers, entring therewith as thicke out of the Towne as waſpes vſe out of the hole of a tree after him that ſtirreth them: but ſo maintained and the skirmiſhes ſo gallantly handled, that they continued ſixe whole dayes togither, in one of which there was killed De Breſe captain of one of the French guardes, and before the Cytadell Coruet was ſlaine, Captaine of one of the companies of the French footmen. Of the Bourgonians there was of reputation taken and brought priſonners the Earle of Pondeuaux of the French Countie, De Trelon of the Duchie of Luxembourg, and other. In the meanetime Bourdillon ſent vnto the King by Neuuy Enſigne of his companie, two Cornets of Bourgonians, broken and defeated at La Haiette, neere to Maubert Fontaine, the Gouernour of Cimetz, one of their cheefe remaining there priſonner, the Baſtard of Auanes another of their cheefe leaders by his good ſpeede and well flying, ſauing himſelfe. Now to returne before Cambray, it was perfectly viewed and by the aduiſe of ſuch as had marked round about from the one end to the other, ioyne the reporte of the ſpyes and ſuch as likewiſe had viewed it within,Deſcription of the towne of cambray. found to be as much ſubiect to the Cannon &amp; mine as any place might be: it is a great towne, ſcituate halfe in a bottome, and halfe hanging, where there is not any ſhew of Bulwarkes, Rampiers, or fortifications according to the new faſhion. On the ſide of Fraunce and the Eaſt, it is in a champion and arable

Countrie,
                  This towne of Cambray was euer coueted of the K. of France, but neuer able to be reduced to the Flower delice, vntil Francis D. of Brabant, Aniou, and Sonne of France, and onely brother to the King, had by ſiege taken the ſame, and ſo annexed by his prowes at this day to the Crowne of Fraunce.
                  The Citadell of Cambray.
                diſcouered well eight hundreth or a thouſand paces in breadth, not ſo plaine notwithſtanding but there is a little deſcent ſtill vnto the Towne hauing certaine ſmall bottomes and barricades betweene both, but I call it plaine for that it is not ouerſhadowed with trees, nor thornes, nor other places hindring the proſpect; on the weſt ſide where it is moſt lowe and the ſuburbs lye, there are gardens and groues of willowes, with ſome medowe and marſhe. Southwards there is a little hanging plaine towards the Towne, and a little further there are little hilles and vallyes, on the North ſide is a little Mountaine which taketh parte of the coigns of the citadell mounted ouer the higheſt parte of the whole towne, where there was wont to be an Abbey or Cathedral Church, almoſt ſquare, notwithſtanding one of the coigns ſtretcheth more towardes that little mountaine, then any part of the reſt, reſembling a coyne in forme of a ſpurre, ſeruing for a defence to the flankers with a platforme. As touching the ſcituation and foundation of the Citadell, one would iudge it at the firſt apparance white earth, as marſe, if it were ſtone within, I would thinke it tender and eaſie to be hewen, as you ſee aſcler whereof ſome houſes are builded, but it is rather a white chalke then a hard ſtone, ſo as ſome holde that it was rather builded to holde the newter towne in ſubiection, then to make an impregnable fortreſſe for being ioyned to the Towne as it is, it were needfull to fortefie it, the one to ſuccour the other, by reaſon that the towne being taken would endemnifie the Citadell, which alſo being forced would be the cauſe of the loſſe of the Towne: but the Emperour partely in conſideration that this great towne would hardly be fortified, or at the leaſt not of a great and long time, and partely for that he would not oppreſſe the inhabitants with ſuddaine ſurcharges, firſt builded this little citadell, to ſet one foot within, and to be meet with the mutynies &amp; rebellions of the citizens, to the end that by little and little he might make himſelfe maiſter of the whole. Therefore they helde out thorough the hope of a great number of men ſent vnto them, furniſhed with victuals, munitions and all other neceſſaries: beſides the Imperiall armye which fortified it ſelfe neer vnto them, to cut of victuals, and annoy as much as might be the French: and laſtly the raines which euer begin at that ſeaſon in thoſe low Countries, ſo great preſumptions had they to recouer the ſiege, for beſides the diuers alarms which they gaue vnto them, with continuall and hot skirmiſhes, they ſent out of the campe part of the field peeces, and cauſed it to be giuen out, that there were farre greater comming from Amiens, Corbie, S. Quentin, and Caſtelet, a great number of Gabions being already prepared, and ſleddes made ready to draw them to thoſe places where the approches ſhould be made, ſo farre as the Marſhals of the Campe went to marke and viewe the ſcituation, the better to order their quarters: notwithſtanding the councell had no ſuch intention, but to the end that ſtill holding them in this iolitye and opinion, they might breake and conſume the Imperials by little and little, who for that cauſe had more enlarged and ſeperated themſelues: wherefore without any longer delay, all the fortes round about being throwne downe and ruined, euen to the very Churches, the Towers and Steeples being vndermined and battered, and fire put to all the Villages, Granges, and cotages, euen to the very ſuburbes and gates of the towne,Feeble places ought not ſo much as to offer to holde out againſt an army bringing canon. the French diſlodged marching ſtraight to the caſtle of Cambreſy. In the waye there were two fortes taken and ruined, obſtinate vpon very ſmall reaſon, whereby they well felte the effect of the conquerers choler. The firſt endured ſixe and thirtie Cannon ſhot, and a great and wide breach before it would yeelde, where the Captaine Pierre-longue was ſlaine, and twelue French Souldiers ſlaine and hurt, notwithſtanding there was not one liuing ſoule found within, hauing cōueyed thē
               ſelues

vnder ground, and hidden in ſome caues and mines, therefore they ſtopped cloſe all the ventes which they were able to finde. The other was not ſo ſtrong as the firſt, for that it was but a skuruie poulier of earth hanging houelwiſe to the halfe of a great towre, with drye ditches, where they within ſtanding very obſtinately to their defence, notwithſtanding any ſummons, made aboade two ſhot of the leſſer ſorte, after which hauing anſwered that they would not yeelde without ſight of the Canon, they made a ſigne to yeelde, but it was too late, for the Souldiers not as yet colde of their firſt furie, neuer ſtayed ſo long as the once diſcharging of a Canon, but ruſhed in as madde men to beate downe the gates, where afterwardes it was great pittie to beholde the ſlaughter which was there made, for there was not ſo much as one man taken to mercye: the battaile lay encamped round about the Caſtle of Cambreſy, without ſuffering any bodye to goe in ſauing one Enſigne, the which was lodged there to repell other, if they ſhould goe about to make any ſtirre: for the inhabitants were in great doubt what ſhould befall them. His Maieſtie and the moſt parte of the Princes and great Lordes was lodged in a ſumptuous houſe of pleaſure neere hand, which appertained to the Biſhop of Cambray, where in ſtead of being reuenged of the burning of his Caſtle of Foulembray, which was done by Du Reux a kinſeman of the B. he not onely ſtraitely forbad they ſhould not ſet it on fire, but that nothing ſhould be carried thence or ſpoyled. A little aboue the riuer the Conſtable remained with the Vantgarde. Now all theſe boutes and deuiſes were but to marke the enemies countenance, for the French being aduertiſed that they ſtirred in no ſorte of the worlde to followe them, without any alarme, or ſemblance to come vpon them, hauing ſoiourned a whole day in that place, deſcended downe to Queſnoy, approching within two leagues of Valenciennes, where the imperial army was imparqued within a forte which they had there addreſſed. The next morning the 17. of September the baggage remaining in that place, and one hundreth men at armes with about 2000. foote for their garde,Repreſentation of the Imperials forte. the reſt of the army aduanced forwarde to ſeeke out the imperials, and to preſent them battaile. Their forte was about a Culuerin ſhotte diſtant from Valenciennes, vpon the ſame Riuer of Leſcau which paſſeth along by Cambray, compaſſed in forme of a ſquare, enuironed with trenches and diches of a Pikes length, and betweene 10. or 12. foote hollow, ſeated halfe on the hanging of the hill towards Valenciennes, and halfe in the bottome along the Riuer, hauing on the ſide of the French a little hillock which went ſloping euen to the forte: beſides that it was very proper to place there the artillerie, and ſhot leuell into the fort, with great diſcommodities, therefore euen as the armye marched their ordinary pace in battaile, the auante couriers and light horſe ruſhing before to attack the skirmiſh, found a great number of their Cauallerie already in order of battaile vpon the little hillock ready for the Combate. And hard by they tooke one of the Countrie on Horſeback in habite of a Marchant, ſome iudging him to be a ſpie, who certified them that the auantgarde of the Imperialls had paſſed the riuer to come to fight with them, ſo as being brought vnto the Conſtable, and from him ſent vnto the K. hee was the cauſe of the aduancing forward of the army, and with as much ſpeede as might be ordering of the battailes in their places. In the meanetime the skirmiſh grew warme, thorough the ſallye of a number of the imperiall fantaſſins, which greatly annoyed the loſt children, without any ſtirring of their men at armes at all, who kept themſelues a little aboue them, ſauing ſuch as ſometimes went out of their ranckes to breake a Launce where they ſaw their opportunitie againſt the French, light horſe encamped front to front. During theſe skirmiſhes the Imperiall armye ranged it ſelfe, part into

one onely ſquare battaile within the forte, and the reſt was deuided by the flankers, eſpecially the Harquebuze ſhot, in the ſame manner as they vſe at the aſſaulte of a Town. The artillery was planted one part vpon mounts of earth, which drew aboue the hillock that I ſaide was one the ſide of the French, and the reſt was diſpoſed as well to ſcoure the defences, as all along the trenches. The ordering of the French army was in this ſorte.
            In the Vantgarde were two ſquare battailes, on the right hand whereof were 24. French Enſignes,The order of the French army hoping to gaine the battaile neer Valenciennes. among which was the Conſtable, the D. of Mompenſier, and the Admirall with their Regimentes of Demilances, which was ſixe hundred men at armes to each one, and a little belowe a partie of the nobles, and ſomewhat higher all their Harquebuſiers on horſebacke: that on the lefte hand was of 19. Enſignes of Lansknets, there was in this wing the Princes, and the D. of Vendoſme, of Neuers, of Anguien, with the like number of men at armes as the right, and a party of the nobles a little more backward, with their men of ordinances, then the Conſtables were to conuer a little hill which was on their left hand, and the Harquebuziers more forward, neere vnto a little Village which was burned, to keepe that the enemy ſhould not ſo much as creepe on all foure by that way, without being eſpied. In the battaile were two other ſquare battaillons, that on the right ſide was of the olde Enſignes, in number 25. In this wing was the King with his whole houſholde and gardes, and the Marſhall of S. Andre with his Regiment of men at armes, on the left ſide were of the Swizers and Griſons 30. Enſignes, the moſt parte armed with corſelettes, vambraſes, caſes, and the beſt furniſhed that of long time hath come into France. In this wing were the Prince of Ferrara, the D. of Guiſe, the Prince of La Roche ſur-yon with their Regiments of demilances, eche one 600. men at armes, the Captaines Momus &amp; Eurard, two of the moſt ancient and beſt experimented, had the leading of the loſt children. Now for ſo much as the fielde was very fit, plaine and champion neer hand a great league, the whole was ſo equally handled, that it hung with one ſame weight and meaſure, eſpecially the ſpaces which remained betweene the battailons of the footemen, and the rankes of the men at armes were ſo well compaſſed, that it ſeemed vnpoſsible to the French, (without ſome very great deſaſtere) that any harme at all ſhould happen vnto them: for to begin with the battailons of the footemen. The order whereof was ſo well eſtabliſhed, as that the author ſeemed to take the inuention thereof from the practiſe of the Romanes, that if the firſt rankes were at any time put backe, they ſhould retire into the ſecond, and the firſt and ſecond into the third, ſo might they three times reſemble and fight vnto the very laſt,An inuention of the French ſo to order, as all their troupes in one day ſhould fight in battaile, taken from the ancient Romanes. each battaillon hauing his flankers of pikes and harquebuſiers which were able to make head in all places, and ſuccour as well the horſemen, as the core of their battailons: The whole was ſo well armed and couered, that when the Sunne had ſhone, you would haue iudged all thoſe troupes to haue bene heapes of Siluer. As for the horſemen each regiment extended farre, ſo as there were alwaies 200. men at armes in a front, and their ſuite of Archers at their backe all along, in ſuch ſorte as if a man at armes had beene ouerthrowne, the ſecond had ſtraight ſtept into his place, ſo as they had al meanes to fight euen to the very laſt. The Enſignes of the men at armes were in the midſt, and the Guidons in the midſt of the ranke of the Archers: as touching the light cauallery, it was deuided into foure ſquadrons, that of the vantecourriers which was at the skirmiſh was led by Paul, Baptiſta and Sanſac kept the other in ambuſh within a little hollow, on the hanging of a ſmall mountaine on the left hand, the Prince of Nemours had an other behinde a little hill betweene the army and the forte of the imperialles

And the prince of Conde lay in ambuſh with his in a little bottome al along the high way to the Towne, to ſtoppe the paſſage that way. Touching the artillerie,How the artillery was ordered and diſpoſed. that of the vantgarde was vpon the front of the right wing, and that of the battaile vpon the hanging of a little hillock, on the lefte hand of the Zuizers and Griſons, who had already made an end of their ceremonies, with intention to fight and dye euen to the very laſt man, before they would make one falſe pointe. Now beſides that the aſſiſtance of ſo many men was able enough to put courage into the moſt faint harted,The K. preſence giueth great encouragement to the Souldiers. the preſence of their King ſet them a gog much more, who being accompanied with a great traine of Princes and other great Lords, went notwithſtanding to viſite and encourage ſuch as had any neede, with ſo ſweete and amiable language, ſtirred vp with ſuch vehemency and affection, that eche one ſeemed moſt willing to dye for his ſeruice. Now his whole army being thus ranged in order of battaile, and the skirmiſh growing more and more eager on the one parte and the other, the Imperiall caualery ſtood ſtil, and ſeemed euer ready to al euents vpon the little hillock. And ſo were they attending their comming more then three long houres, a brute of their comming flying vp and downe ſo long among the French, that night at the laſt approched. In the end the Conſtable foreſeeing that they cunninglye delayed vntill the night grew darke, either to ſurpriſe or put them out of order, aduiſed the light Cauallerye to ioyne together to ſeeke out the height of the Imperiall Cauallerie.The charge of the French Cauallerie. The which was readilye executed, but with ſuch a cheerefulneſſe and dexteritye, that they beate them backe, and liuelye droue them in leſſe then nothing, euen to the very boorde of their Trenches, cauſing them almoſt all to fall huddle vpon one anothers tayle into them; where of the French ſide of reputation was ſlaine Ienlis a gentleman of the Duchie of Bourgondie, hauing beene brought vp of a Page in the Kings houſe: it was then that their artillerie, as well that of the flankers, as that which was vpon the mountes of earth, began to play their priſe, the which killed ſome, and hurte more of the French then were found to haue beene hurte by any handſtrokes. Among the reſt there was ſlaine the Captaine Steph an Italian Gentleman, Lieutenant of the companyes of light horſe to the Captaine Senetaire, and De Ferriere Lieutenant of the companies of light horſe to Giury of the houſe of Eſtanges. This bickering endured for all that more then a long houre, where on the French parte there was ſlayne of horſe and foote about one hundred men, ſo as when the retraite was ſounded the Sunne was alreadye ſet, and the night cloſed in. Now had the Councell long debated, whether they ſhould aſſayle them euen within their owne forte or no, conſidering the good happe of their firſte charge. But the better parte were of opinion that they were rather to content themſelues, in that they had already done them ſo great ſhame in their own Countrye, as not onely to haue executed a parte of their Princes will, but to haue preſented vnto them the battaile,Conſultation whether the enemies were to be aſſailed within their own forte or no. which they ſtill threatned to doe from the beginning, and now coldely enough and with a ſlender excuſe had refuſed. Their reaſons not to attempt any further were; firſt that the French Souldiers were growne wearye and faynte, as well with marching as with the weight of their armour, contrariwiſe the enemies were freſh and repoſed, not hauing for certayne dayes together runne the fielde. That the Countrie was theirs, and their proper enheritance, which would encourage them to fight the more couragiouſly. Ioynt that conſidering the ſcituation of the place, they could not be aſſailed but to their great aduātage, as the battaile of Poitiers and La Bicoique might well ſerue for example. Likewiſe that the French were not onely to fight at the firſt forte, from which though it were

loſt, the Imperials might eaſily retire into the towne, ready to begin a freſh; eſpecially when they ſhould be able to doe both the one and the other, the French ſhould be ſure to be the firſt which ſhould take all the paine and hazard of the enterpriſe, a good parte of them lefte behinde in gage, if not all, as well for that it is not the propertie or nature of a Zuizer or Lansknet, to aſſaile a towne or fortreſſe, as in that they are not otherwiſe ſo affectionate or enclined as ſubiects are to their Prince, whereby if it ſhould ſo happen that the K. ſhould be in an enemies Countrye, vnfurniſhed of the better parte of his forces,Retraite of the French. it were to be feared that many miſcheefes would enſue, according to the vncertain occurrence of feates of armes. And therefore it was concluded that it was far better to retire with honor, thē to hazard ought vnder the hope of an vncertain &amp; aduenterous good luck, ſo they placed againe the battailons of fantery in ſingle ordinance: afterwards they returned to the place where their baggage was loſt, the Conſtable with all the Demilances and Cauallerie of the vantgarde, was the laſt which departed to ſee if they would play the wagges in the end, and ſet vpon them behinde, which they neuer once offred; ſo as by the light of the fires which burned the Farmes and villages for three leagues round about, the French in the end found their firſt lodging, where at night it was propoſed in councell by ſome Lords, that there was very great meanes and occaſion offred to returne againe to ſeek out the enemye, to fight with them, and enforce them within their owne forte, for that by the reporte of ſome priſonners which were newlye come thither, it was not of ſo great defence as it was adiudged: aſſuring that on the South ſide in the bottome by the riuer it was very weake, and that there their trench was not perfited nor fiue foot high, that there would be meanes enough to pitch and order the battailes, and to make it be aſſailed by the loſt children, whilſte that the artillerye planted vpon the hillockes of the flancker ſhould ſhoote leuell in. The which would either make thē to come out in diſorder and ſo quit the place, or ſuffer themſelues to become a deadly marke to ſo many Cannon ſhot, as would ſhoure downe vpon them. But albeit that this aduice was at the firſt allowed for ſound, yet after that the olde and experienced Captaines, had deliuered their minde, and ſpoke as they thought good, they found that the latter opinion was the more ſure: following which, after one dayes abode to refreſh themſelues, the army retired towards the caſtle of Cambreſy, where likewiſe the French remained another daye, without ſetting fire either on that fayre houſe, or the towne, onely all the victuals within were taken out, for that the enemies ſhould not be releeued therewith. Afterwardes they retired as farre as Fonſomme, two ſmall leagues from S. Quentin: and there was the army diſſolued about the 20. of September,Retrait &amp; departure of the French army. for the Zuizers well paid and contented, had leaue to retire into their owne Countrie, and parte of the Garriſons was put all along the frontiers, and the reſt ſent home to the gouernement of their Captaines: as much was done with all the Nobles and rirebands. The other parte of the Demilances and light Cauallerie,The Marſhall. S. Andre ſent with part of the army to recouer the County of S. Poul. with the olde Enſignes and the Almanes, were retyred and aſſembled at Auchy to Chaſteau below Hedin, &amp; led very ſhortly after by the Marſhal S. Andre towards the Countye of S. Pol to deſtroy it vtterly, and to waſte and ruine for euer, as well the Baylifwicke of Hedin, as the Countye of Ponthieu, and all the reſt of the countrye of Arthois, which was put in execution by him in the very viewe of his enemies, without any reſiſtance, remaining ſtil ſuperiour, with ſuch fury and deſolation, that there was not ſo much as the poor ſhepheards cottages or houels ſpared, but the whol country ſet on fire, &amp; aſhes round about Aire, S. Omer, Liſlars &amp; Perne, the caſtle wherof was by force taken, &amp; about 50. ſpaniſh ſouldiers ſlain &amp; hewen in peces.

Thus was the voyage of the French armye, more remarquable for fires, ruynes, ſackings, and all other ſorte of deſolations, by th'example: and in reuenge of the Hannuyers and Bourgonians ouer France, then for any tricke of notable vertue, ſauing a braue skirmiſh which the Vidaſme of Chartres made before Liſſars, with fifteene Enſignes of French Fanterie, and almoſt two thouſand horſe, againſt nineteene Enſignes of the Spaniſh Fanterie which lay encamped about the little towne, for that the inhabitants had ſhutte the gates vpon them, fearing to be ſacked by them as their neighbours had beene. The skirmiſh laſted almoſt a whole day, eche partye being obſtinate to the gaining of the victory, which after a long hazard &amp; vncertaine combate, remained to the French, very few of them being either dead or hurte, but many more of the Spaniards, whereof in like ſort diuers were brought away priſonners. After all this coyle the French returned to Anchy, and about Hedin,Count Reingraue. where the Almanes were put in garriſon, the bayliwick whereof was giuen by the King to the Count Reingraue. In ſumme towards the end of the moneth of October, ſome companies as well of the French Fanterie, as light cauallerie being caſt, the reſt were deuided and put into garriſons, to paſſe ouer the winter which drew on.
            In the meane time the Emperour proceeded on to purſue a marriage betweene his ſon the K. of Spaine, and the infant Mary new Q. of England, with ſuch earneſtnes, as he forgot nothing which might ſerue to the conſummation thereof;A marriage treated between the K. of Spaine, and the infant Mary new Q. of England. ſeing him ſelfe almoſt out of all hope to haue ſuccour elſewhere, or recouering of any monie at neerer hand: which many of that Realme ſought to hinder foreſeeing an immortal warre with the French, which was prepared for them by this meanes; remembring well the loſſes and damage which they had alreadye ſuſtained, in hauing vpholden the warre againſt this nation, from whence the Countrie of England reaped great commodities. Notwithſtanding ſo much auayled the perſwaſions of the Emperor, with the inſtigation of the two Queenes Mary and Elenor, and aboue all the inductions of Cardinall Pole coſin to the Q. that ſhe being cleane rauiſhed with this new loue, and with the ambition to ſee her ſelfe wife to the Sonne of an Emperour, the better to aſſure her eſtate againſt the reformed and other malcontents, in ſpite of the aduiſe and liking of the greateſt of her Realme, keeping her ſiſter Elizabeth likewiſe a priſonner, conſented to this marriage. Afterwards with as much ſpeede as was poſſible ſhe affianced by Proctor (which was the Earle of Aiguemont) Philip K. of Spaine hoping ſhortlye after to perfit and conſumate the ouerplus. The K. knowing that all theſe things tended to no other end, but cheefely to endamage and annoy him, made a great maſſe of monie, calling ſuch to his aide and ſuccour, as he knew were moſt obedient and faithfull vnto him, and as hee thought beſt able to aide and do him ſeruice.
            Pope Iuly to the end to pacifie theſe great troubles of Chriſtendome,Cardinal Pole ſent to treat a peace betweene the K. and the Emperour. had ſent the Cardinall of England to mediate a peace betweene the King and the Emperour, for you muſt vnderſtand that vpon the purſute of the warres of theſe two Princes, Pope Iuly ſeeing all Europe as it were much moued with the feare of miſcheefes which was likely to enſue to euery Countrye, by reaſon of the particular quarrels of theſe two Monarcks, with a ſecret remorſe and gnawing of conſcience, for himſelfe had beene the Author, had ſent the Cardinall of England his Legate to the King and the Emperour, to aduiſe, and by all meanes to vnite, and cauſe them to condeſcend to a good peace: in which he imployed himſelfe ſo vertuouſly, that laying aſide all ambition, or feare of hatred, or other cōſiderations, he neuer ceaſed to lay

before them the infinite miſeries wherewith the poore Chriſtian people were afflicted, togither with the vncertaintye and miſerable eſtate, whereunto the Catholicke Church by their diſſentions was reduced. And albeit that many accounted him to fauour the Emperour more then the King, yet hee ſeemed to haue ſo well managed their hartes, that the hope of a peace was alreadye common thorough out Fraunce, and quarters neighbouring about: yea ſo great that the poore borderers of the one and other Lord, perſwading themſelues thereof, ſo aſſured themſelues by little and little, that they reedified and began to reinhabite their cottages and ſmall tenementes, as yet beſmoaked with the fire, wherewith they had beene burned to aſhes, ſo farre as euery man promiſed vnto himſelfe a happy repoſe, if it would pleaſe God to mollifie the harts of theſe two great Princes. But euen as all the tokens of Moſes and Aaron hardened the more the obſtinate courage of Pharaoh, to the end afterwards to make the great wonders of the Lord to appeare: ſo this great God, not yet ſatisfyed and content with ſo ſmall a puniſhment for our enormous ſinnes, would not permit vnto them the vnderſtanding to receaue a good and aſſured peace, for the eaſe and repoſe of all Chriſtendome: wherfore the Legate after many trottings to and fro of each ſide, returned very ſorrowfull vnto the Pope, leauing in the harts of theſe two Princes, this ſo inueterate an enmitie, whereof the clamors could not ſo ſoone mortifie the effects.
            The Queene was deliuered at Fontaine-bleau about nine of the clocke and three quarters paſt in the morning,Birth of Mounſier. the eighteenth of March 1554. of a ſonne named Hercules by Charles Cardinall of Lorraine, Anne de Montmorency Conſtable, and the Ducheſſe of Guyſe daughter to the D. of Ferrara: afterwards leauing that name he was called Francis D. of Alencon, and of Aniou.
            In the meane ſpace and about the firſt of the ſpring there aroſe a certaine brute of a warre at hand betweene theſe Princes, and much furniture and weapons were diſperſed, whereby they might bee poliſhed and made readye to the ſeruice, afterwardes to be muſtered, as ſoone as the fame was ſpread throughout France, how the Emperour had prepared a great leauye of men of warre, and all other ſortes of prouiſions, towardes the Countries of Liege and Ardennes, with intent to beſiege the Towne of Meſieres, hauing eſtabliſhed Mariembourg and Auanes, as ſtore places and markets to his armye, ſo as Bourdillon who then was at the Courte, was preſently ſent back to fortifie &amp; ſtrengthen this little Towne, with whatſoeuer ſhould be neceſſary to attend their comming. On the other ſide the K. foreſeeing the Empeperours determination and intent, made all meanes to aſſemble his forces, to the end to meet him and preuent him of this ſmall enterpriſe, hauing ſent ſufficient enough of ſuccour into Piemont and Italye, thereby to purſue and continue ſuch good beginning, as fortune in that parte had preſented vnto him. Beſides hee diſpatched Captaines and commiſsioners to bring him men of warre as well out of Germany as from thoſe Cantons of Zuizers as were his confederates. This was about the ende and iſſue of the Spring, when as the Sunne rayſing him ſelfe high, to ſend among vs his great heates, burned and conſumed the fruites of the earth, with ſo ſtrange a drouthe, that togither with the long trauayle of the warre the poore people expected nought els to the aggrauating of their miſeryes, then a great and mortall famine for the heape of all theyr pouertyes, which notwithſtanding came not to paſſe, and ſo certaine dayes paſſed ouer, that the King ſeeing all his forces readye, albeit that his enemye made ſemblaunce of nought

els, then buſied in the conſummation of his ſonnes marriage, determined to aduaunce forward, and by the ſame place that he was threatned to be aſſayled,The K. army aſſembled in diuers pleces. to aſſaye him, and enter within his Countryes. To this end he aſſembled his forces and deuided them into three, to wit, in Pickardy about Saint Quintin, vnder the Prince of La Roche Sur-yon, in the Valley of Laon, towards Crecy vnder the Conſtable, and at Meſieres vnder the Duke of Niuernois. Vnder the Prince of La Roche Sur-yon, might be nine or ten thouſand footmen, the moſt parte Picardes, and the reſt of the olde Enſignes, with three hundred men at armes, and fiue or ſixe hundred horſe, and Harquebuziers on horſeback. Vnder the Conſtable were fiue and twentye Enſignes of French fanterie new and olde, two Regiments of Germanes of the Count Reingraue and Reifberg, and fiue and twenty Enſignes of Zuizers, with foure hundred men at armes, and neere eighteene hundred or two thouſand as wel light horſe as Harquebuziers on horſeback, whereof the Duke D' Aumale was Generall, a little before come out of priſon, and almoſt as many nobles in the Rireband, vnder La Iaille their General, there were alſo ſome companies of Engliſh and Scottiſh Cauallerye. The D. of Niuernois had twentye olde Enſignes of French Fanterie, drawne from the garriſons of Metz, Verdun, Thoul, d'Anuille, Yuoy, and Montmedy, (comprehending therein foure Engliſh and Scottiſh Enſignes) in place of which other new were put in, two Regiments of the Count Rokendolphe, and of the Baron of Frontenay, three hundred men at armes, neere eight hundred light horſe and Harquebuziers on horſeback, whereof the Prince of Conde was generall, and two hundred piſtoliers Germanes. The army then being thus deuided in three diuers places,The French entreth in 3. places within the Emperours country. to the end to holde the enemy in doubt of what they had deliberated to execute, and on which ſide they wold ſurpriſe him, the French entred by three ſeueral places into his Country. The Prince of La Roche Sur-yon hauing paſſed the riuer of Somme, gaue within Artois, with a moſt cruel and furious a beginning, burning and ruining all the Countrye alongſt as hee paſſed. The Conſtable hauing taken his waye towardes Mauber Fontaine, the 23. of Iune, fained as though hee would addreſſe himſelfe towards Auanes; the common brute being that hee went to beſiege it: but as ſoone as the Enſignes of France were diſcouered by thoſe of the plaine Countrie, they abandoned Villages, boroughs, Caſtles, and other places, conſtrained for their ſurety to retire within the Ardennes, with the better parte of their moueables and Cattell, eſteeming themſelues (conſidering the places vnacceſſible, thorough the difficultie of being able to bring artillerye) exempt and out of all perilles, amidſt the thickeſt of thoſe woods, by reaſon whereof they were able the more eaſilye to ruyne the Village and Caſtle of Cimetz, the Caſtles of Trelon, Glaion, Commins, and other little fortes neere hand. Beſides their retreate ſerued them to very ſmall purpoſe for the Duke of Neuers being determined to tame and bring vnder his obedience, this nation ſmallye frequented through the difficulty of the Ardennes, diſlodging from Meſieres, encamped his armye at the entrance of the Ardennes, in a Valley rough and vnpleaſant enough, at the end of which there is a little Village called Vieil-meſeuil, a name very aptlye giuen,The army of the D. of Neuers and his exploites. for that it was rather compoſed of olde ruynes of manors, then of houſes of habitation. And that night hee diſpatched De Marets a Gentleman of Niuernois; one of the moſt ancient and experienced men at armes of his company, together with his Trumpetter to ſummon the Caſtle of Orcimond, diſtant ſixe great leagues thence, to whom the gouernour called Colas Lois, Lieutenant to Bayſon a Gentleman of Liege, who a little

before nothing miſtruſting their comming, was departed thence, anſwered that hee would neuer yeelde except he ſaw the Cannon, not for that hee eſteemed the Caſtle tenable, but by reaſon of the height of the Rocke vpon which it was ſcituate, which was almoſt vnacceſſible on two ſides, notwithſtanding they planted the artillery in a little plaine towards the wood for the batterie, the place appertained to Barlemont Generall of the Emperours finances. This anſwere being heard, the Prince determined to goe ſomewhat neerer to viewe them, and to lodge his armye one league from the Caſtle,The difficulty of the Ardennes. if the difficultie of the places had not ſtayed him halfe way, in ſome places ſo hard and ſtonye, that it was impoſſible for either men or horſe to ſtand ſure, and beſides ſo ſtraite, that they were enforced to march ſingle by one and one, and in ſome ſo ſteepe and painefull, that their breath failed them in climing, and elſe where the deſcents were ſo ſteepe, that they were faine to creepe downe pace by pace, and to graſpe and holde faſt, except their head ſhould firſte tumble downe, to their aſſured death: ſo as the horſes ſerued to very ſmall vſe for drawing of the artillerie, the force of mens armes being there much more needefull, for the better and more ſure managing and conducting thereof: true it is that throughout there was ſo good order kept, as the enemies could hardly giue any impediment therevnto, for that all the waies were furniſhed with Harquebuziers euery ten pace, for the ſuretye of the whole trayne: this night being the 29. of Iune, the Prince encamped in another Valley called the Valley of Suranda, neere vnto a rocke, where was wont to be the forte of Linchant,
               The fort of Linchant ruined. Streame of Semois. at this day for the moſt parte ruined, vnder which and all alongſt this valley runneth a riuer, or rather a ſwifte ſtreame called Semois, which runneth towards Bouillon, and falleth into La Meuſe, vnderneath Chaſteau Regnaut, from this place hee ſent Iamets with a Regiment of French Fanterie, and artillerye to batter the Caſtle of Orcimont, which as ſoone as it was ſaluted with two Cannon ſhot, they within being altogither diſmaied, without concluding in any other ſorte of yeelding, neuer ſet themſelues to any defence, but the Cheefe ſecretly ſhut vp all the keyes, and by a ſecret poſterne which opened into this valley between the rocks, ſaued himſelfe with 12. of his moſt fauoured Souldiers, leauing the reſt well aſtoniſhed and doubtfull of the euent,The Caſtle of Orcimont ſummoned, beſieged battered, and yeelded vp by the flight of the Defendants. who notwithſtanding ſhortlye after yeelded themſelues to the mercy of the Prince, whoſe priſonners they were: when the Captains of the reſt of the fortes all along theſe wayes, had receiued aduertiſement that for certaine the Prince had trained his artillerye, which before they would neuer haue beleeued, without further endeuouring how to annoy his paſſage, or to ſtoppe and hinder his wayes with great Logges and trees felde downe, as they are wont, cleane abandoning their fortes, munitions, and all places whether they were wonte to retyre themſelues, they fledde of all handes, ſo as being arryued at Louettela grande, after their departure from the Valley of Suranda, they found a little forte called Villarcy, of earth and timber, all voide, the which 25. or thirtie Couriers which had been there within had quited, vnder the charge of the Captaine La Loſse borne at Meſieres, which euer ſince his tender age had beene brought vp in the ſeruice of Lumes, and after his death continually followed the parties of his maiſter. Abandoning thus this forte, hee ſet fire of all the houſes and ſurplus of the reſt of the village, whereby the Vaſtadors ordained thereunto by the D. were eaſed of much paines, A Church likewiſe which the Ardennois had cauſed to bee fortified called Fort de Iadines, was found open and abandoned, which in like ſorte was all razed, and beaten downe ſauing a great ſquare tower, whoſe coynes and faſtnings in the building were

broken and ſcattered about, by the Cannon ſhot, which the Prince in paſſing by cauſed to be giuen. In ſomme al the villages, faire enough cōſidering the barrenes of the Countrie, were burned and deſtroyed. And for that the fort of Iadines was the moſt hurtfull of all the reſt to the French, bordering vpon them, the gouernours of Meſieres oftentimes aſſaied to take it, but euer in vaine vntill this blow. About the laſt day of Iune, the Prince encamped at the village of Valſimont in the bottome of a vallie,
                  Valſimont the 4 lodging of the D. of Neuers armie.
                  Streame of Vouye.
                where a ſwift ſtreame runneth called Vouye, which commeth from the mountaines and falleth into Meuſe neere at hand: thence he ſent the Harrowlde of Angouleſme with his trumpet or to ſommon the Caſtle of Beaurin, in the confines of Ardennes, &amp; vpon the limits of the countrie of Liege, which likewiſe appertained to Barlemont, the Emperours fauorite. Reporte being made vnto him, how the ſouldiours had brought great booties out of the woods, with a number of women and young maydens, knowing that in this furie of warre, they could hardly helpe and protect them ſelues, he made them all to be ſhut vp, with commandement vpon paine of life not to do them any force or violence: but to bring them all into a certaine lodging, wher hauing vſed great liberalitie towards the ſouldiers, he made them be ſafely kept vntill the next morrow that the Campe was departed. And then vpon the reporte of the Harrowlde of Angonleſme, how they of Beaurin ment not to yeeld except they ſaw the Cannon, they marched thitherwards. Hereupon ſuch as were appointed to take the view were receiued by them with the bullets of many harquebuſes a croc,The Caſtle of Beaurin ſummoned. and muskets, willing to ſhew that they were prouided as well of courrage as other neceſſaries, ſo attending vntill fower Cannons were preſented vnto them, readie to giue fire. But finding what danger they were in, and being aduertiſed that if they did not yeeld they ſhould all paſſe at the ſwords point, and ſuch as eſcaped by the hangmans hand, after hauing a while parlied and demaunded to eſcape life and goods ſaued, they were in the end reduced to this extreamitie, that they ſhould yeeld themſelues to the good mercie and pleaſure of the Prince: who cauſed the chiefe of them to bee kept priſoners, and ſent away the reſt of the pettie companions, euery man a white ſticke in his hand. Iohn Colichart borne at Bains in Heinault Captaine of this Caſtle, was led away priſonner with 40. of his beſt ſouldiers.Beaurin Caſtle yeelded. Among which was the Captaine of the forte of Iadines, named Le Grand Gerard and La Loſſe, of whome I ſpoke before Captaine of Vilargy, who was not put at all to any ranſome, but ſent backe ſhortly after to Meſieres, there to be puniſhed as a traytor. The D. of Neuers lodged within the Caſtle a companie of foote of the olde enſignes, and 50. harquebuſieres on horſebacke. At their departure from this ſiege, each man began to reioyce, that he ſhould out of this grieuous and painefull deſert, and enter into Liege a countrie ſo pleaſant and delectable: taking their diſcent by the ports of Giuets the moſt renowned vpon, the ryuer of Meuſe. But before I paſſe any further, I will not forget how as wel to render the Nauigation of this riuer which runneth all alongſt the countries of Liege, and Brabant eaſie and open vnto them,Cap. Salſede commiſsioner generall for victuals, conquered al the Caſtles along the riuer. as to enforce the reſt of the ſmall Caſtles and little forts, alongſt, there was left there the Capitane Salſede, generall commiſſioner for all the victuals and munitions, with ſixe companies of French fanterie, and two Cannons. Who after that by force he had taken the Caſtle of Sumet, appertaining to the D. of Aſcot, he cleane abandoned that of Hurge, which appertained to Barlemont.
            
            As the Prince of La Roche Sur-yon burned all Artois and the borders about, without any reſiſtance at all made to his little armie, ſo the Conſtable hauing cauſed the bruite to be giuen out that his determination was to beſiege Auannes, ſo

farre as that the light cauallerie had more then once skirmiſhed before it as though they ment to view it, albeit it was well ſtrengthened with a Garriſon &amp; other munitions, being notwithſtanding aduertiſed how Mariembourge had but a bare ordinarie Garriſon, and that ſmall, the moſt couertly that was poſsible, cauſed the Marſhall S. Andre to depart with the Suiſers, and ſome companies of French foote, aſsiſted with two or three thouſand horſe, and the moſt part of the artillerie, who made ſo good ſpeede, hauing all that night cleared the waies and Lanes, which the enemies had ſtopped, and hedged in. As the 23. of Iune, at ten of the clocke in the morning, he was come with all his troupes before Mariembourg. Whereat they within being altogether aſtoniſhed, and much more the night after when they vnderſtoode that the ſuccours which they attended were driuen backe, and no poſsibilitie for them to enter, yet to ſhew themſelues as men not diſmaied, they played infinitly with the Cannon, which for all that would not ſerue the turne, any whit at all to ſtaie theſe new come gueſts from beginning their approches and trenches. So as the next morrow the Conſtable being ariued with the reſt of the armie, and ſeeing the good beginning of this ſiege, to bring it to a better end, he cauſed the approches to bee continued with ſuch diligence, as the third day of the ſiege, hauing made fiue or ſixe Voleys of artillerie onely to breake the defences, a parley was requeſted by the beſiedged. In ſomme many of their Articles being refuſed, they condeſcended in the end to yeelde vp the place to the K. liues and goods ſaued, all ſauing armor, munition and artillerie, and De Rinſart remained priſoner with the Captaines and principals of the Cittie. Which being well ſtored with al munition of an ineſtimable price, was thus yeelded vp the 28. of Iune, 1554. Whereat the K. much reioyſing, ſhortly after departed towards Laon,Mariembourg taken by the French. ther to find againe his armie the laſt day of the month. The which in ſigne of ioye at his ariuall was pitched in order of battell, and the whole artillerie diſcharged, yeelding a maruellous report and eccho betweene the woodes and the rockes of the Ardennes, giuing notice to the reſt of the imperiall townes of the yeelding vp of this. Which in reſpect it was the rampart of the whole countrie was wel enough fortified. It had beene in former times a litle village where all aſſemblies for any great hunting ſtill met, in which Q. Marie tooke ſingular pleaſure. But for that ſhee found the ſeate thereof very proper and delectable, ſhee fell a building there ſparing nothing which was any waies requiſite to the beautie or fortification thereof, which ſhee would in farre better ſorte haue perfited, had not the K. taken it who not onely was ſtudious to finiſh what as yet was vnperfit, but better to fortifie and rampire it, then euer it was before: commaunding them of Mariembourg, to name it from thence forwardes Henriembourg.
            
               Rocroy a ſmall village between Maubert-fontaine and Mariembourg fortified for the ſafetie of the paſſage.Now to the end to make the way more eaſie, and the better to be of diſcouerie, as farre as the little towne of Maubert-fontaine which was the next, they cauſed a little village called Rocroy to bee fortified, within which they lodged the Capitane La Lande, with his enſigne of 300. men on foote, the Capitane Breuil of Bretaigne with three companies of French ſtill remaining in Mariembourge. Shortly after Gonor was ſent thither from Diſnan: hauing already beene gouernour of Metz, who receiued the King, order to remaine Leiutennant generall at Mariembourg, at the hands of the D. of Neuers. Who at his departure from Ardennes, a little after the taking of the Caſtle of Beaurin, had ſent the Harrowlde of Angouleſme, with his trompetor, to ſummon the Caſtle, and towne of Diſnan, and to know whether the inhabitants determined to continue in newtralitie ſuch as was accorded in the countrie of Leige, or if they would hold out, for and in the name of whome, of the Emperour

or the Biſhop of Liege. But in ſteade of yeelding an honeſt anſwere, or ſpeaking like a ſouldier, farre forgetting themſelues,Their anſwere of Diſnan to the D. Harro
                     •
                  lde and trumpeter. they anſwered them that if they had in their hands the K. and the D. of Neuers harts and liuers, they would ſoone make a frycaſſe of them for their breakfaſt, pelting there with ſo many Harquebuſe ſhot at them, that they were compelled to returne with all ſpeede and deliuer their report. The D. of Neuers being come downe with his armie, as farre as the ports of Giuets the firſt day of Iuly, found that the Caſtle of Agimont not yet yeelded, ſtanding on this ſide the Meuſe a quarter of a league from the other Giuets, albeit it had beene already ſummoned. Notwithſtanding the ſame day hee made a number of his light Cauallerie to paſſe the water, with certaine companies of foote, to enuiron the Caſtle, attending the K. army which marched from Mariembourg of purpoſe to ioyne with them. Now as the vantgarde of the K. armie ariued, the footemen made ſemblance as though they would ſcale it, and giue the aſſault,The K. armie. which in the end turned to good earneſt, for the ſouldiers entred ſo farre and furiouſly in ſporte that they within could no longer ſuſtaine their aſſault. In ſuch ſort as they were compelled to acquite and abandon the defences, and to giue them entrance: ſo as being entred with furie, they put all to the ſword, that offred to make any reſiſtance, which was for al that no great number, nor men of any marke. And there was taken priſonner the Captaine of the Caſtle called Eurard de la Marche, owne ſonne to the Earle of Rochefort, Father to him who then liued, Lord of the place, and the moſt part of the reſt of the ſouldiers, were ſent away the morrow after. The whole armie remained on this ſide at Giuets, encamped for the moſt part betweene the borough and the Caſtle, in a long &amp; ſpacious plane: and notwithſtanding that this great riuer made a ſeperation between the two armies, yet did not their kinsfolkes, friendes, neighbours, and companions faile continually to croſſe ouer to viſit and feaſt one another. The King himſelfe being moued with the good report which he had heard of the D. armie paſſed ouer in perſon to ſee it in battell on Wenſday the ſixt of that month, and found it in ſo good order, and equipage, that hee grew thereat much contented. Now there remained but a little forte called Caſteau Thierry which appertained to the Baylife of Namur, or elſe all round about was ſubiected to the K. obedience. Therefore there was ſent thither the ſame day a regiment of the French footemen, with artillerie, and ſome companies of horſe: but thoſe which kept it vnderſtanding what entertainment they had had at Agimont, neuer tarrying their comming quitte the place in good time; So was the Caſtle found emptie, and abandonned, but furniſhed with moſt faire moueables as was poſsible, and great quantitie of all ſorts of graine. Theſe two armies ſoiourned at the two Giuets ſix whole daies together, and the ſeuenth diſlodged▪ the Kinges feete kept on the way on this ſide the Meuſe, and the D. of Neuers for the difficultie of the waies, was faine to encampe that night in a vallie two leagues from Dinan, aboue which there was a Caſtle called Valuin, which was found emptie, and hee lodged in the baſe courte. The next morrow the two armies encamped aboute the Towne and Caſtle of Diſnan and Bouines. The artillerie being planted vpon the height of an hollow thorough which the high way paſſed which went to the plane aboue, battered Bouines ſo furiouſly vntill three of the clocke at afternone,Bouines furiously battered and taken by aſſault. that a breach being made at a portail, and within a Tower, the aſſault was therewith all giuen, and carried away with ſmall reſiſtance, being onely defended by them of the Towne it ſelfe, with whome it fared full ill for their labour: For vpon the firſt furie there was made a ſore ſlaughter, ſome thinking to ſaue themſelues leaped into the water: and yet for all that they coulde not eſcape death, the moſt part of them being

ſlaine with Harquebuze ſhot, whilſt that they dipped to the bottome of the water like Duckes. The reſt albeit that they had croſſed the riuer, and ſo taken priſonners by the French, were afterwards hanged, and ſtrangled: for hauing ſo raſhly reſiſted and held out againſt the K. power. True it is that in the recompence of the faire warres which the Spaniards made vnto the French, at the taking of Teroenne, the K. pardoned and ſaued a number of their liues,Forts puniſhed for holding againſt the K. power. which were retired into the great Tower which ſtoode aboue the Towne. Afterwards of his great &amp; accuſtomed humanitie, he cauſed the women maidens, and young children to bee all ſaued, and gaue vnto them for their better ſafe conduct, a Harrowlde and a trumpetor. Now the verie ſame morning as the D. of Neuers hard by the Caſtle of Diſnan, would needes him ſelfe with Iamets goe neere to take the view, Iamets horſe next adioyning to his owne perſon was ſlaine with a Harquebuze a croc: himſelfe being warned there by, how ſuch cheefes of an armie ought not ſo venterouſly to expoſe themſelues to ſuch perill: for that day notwithſtanding the batterie was not begun, for that the artillerie came not time enough; but onely all the reſt of the day, many Cannons playde, to begin to breake downe the defences,A chiefe of an armie ought not to be to ventrous. and certaine Gabions, as well vpon the portaile, as at a little round Tower aboue the Towne, which greatly annoyed them: ſo as all that night was employed in making with al diligence the aproches and trenches, but not without great danger for the numerable ſhot, of artillerie &amp; Harquebuſes a croc which played from the Caſtle, without any murther for all that, or loſſe of any perſon other then miſerable pyoners. The next morning this Caſtle was ſaluted with thertie great peeces of artillerie, fiftene on the D. ſide, and as many on the Kinges on the other ſide of the riuer which gaue all along the hollow, and euen within the verie Caſtle: ſo as a wall of Bricke which was the higheſt was perced thorough by day, they battered likewiſe in flancke, a great round Tower, at the corner of a core of lodging which looked towardes the North. On the Dukes ſide was battered a great round Tower, ſeated at the end of the ſame lodging, cleauing to the bulwarke of the portall: and this thundering continued without ceaſing day and night vntill Tueſday, about three of the clocke in the afternone, that theſe two Towers were rayſed and battered downe, and a breach made at the ende aboue this lodging about tenne pace long, notwithſtanding it was verie vneaſie to clyme, for that the Cannon could not faſten vpon the foote of the wall, being amaine Rocke. Ioynte, that they muſt be faine to creepe a Pikes length, and the aſcent was very ſlipperie, and vnſure vnder the ſouldiers feete, by reaſon of the earth and cement which continually fell vpon it. But for all this it was reſolued at the inſtant to giue the aſſault. And the Admirall led ſuch companies of French as were ordained thereto vnto the foote of the breach, praying and exhorting them with many faire, and gracious remonſtrances, to remember the immortall renowne, which the French had achieued for feates of armes thorough out the whole world: and of their dutie where with they ſtoode bounde for the faith and aſſurance which the K. repoſed in them, this ſpeech being ended, ſome Capitanes followed with their valiantteſt ſouldiers, marched on, and with an aſſured gate aduanced forward to clime vp: the Capitane Maugeron being one of the firſt, ſo as they within eſteeming him to be followed hard, and that the French would of them ſelues ſtoupe, and creepe in, ſet fire of a trayne which they had prepared, which beeing quenched if the ſouldiers purſuing their enterpriſe had but aſſaied to enter the enemies could neuer haue held out longer, the walls hauing beene alreadie ſo ſhaken &amp; broken with the artillerie, that it was vnpoſsible for them anie longer to endure. But if ſome of the French performed their part well, there were other which bee haued

themſelues ſo coldly, that they haue left a very bad opinion of them. The Capitane Saragoſe being enſigne colonel went to it verie brauelie and was ſore hurt, ſo did the Capitanes Gourdes, La Mole and Le Forte, whoſe enſigne bearer called Le Baſque was there ſlaine, and flong downe from top to the bottome, and his enſigne thrice taken vp, they ſtill being caſt downe which tooke it vp, ſo as at laſt it remained in the hands of a Gaſcon ſouldier named Fougaſſet. The Admirall Colonel of al the French fanterie, ſeeing his ſouldiers thus to waxe coole, excuſing themſelues by the narrownes, and euill acceſſe to the breach, to giue them hart began a little more ſeuerely to exhort them, ſhewing vnto them, that if in the K. preſence they would make no better proofe of their hardines the good reputation which they had heretofore gotten, would turne them to a farre greater reproch, and a perpetuall infamie. The which he had no ſooner finiſhed, but the further to ſet them in a heate hee began firſt himſelfe, and after him the more to encourage them, Monpeſat (albeit he had no charge at all in their bands) ſeaſed vpon one of their enſignes, and brauely before them all carried it vp to the top, where he couered himſelfe behinde certaine quarters and ruines of the wall which was fallen downe; calling them and making ſigne with the enſigne that they ſhould follow him. It was impoſſible for all that, to make them take any further courage vnto them: whereby ſome Captaines before well eſteemed of were very ill thought of euer after, of whome ſome were diſgraded, caſt from their charge, declared villanes and vnable to beare armes in the face of the whole armie, which witneſſed their fault. As the night came on, ſo was the retreate ſounded. That day they of the Towne of Diſnan, yeelded themſelues at the mercy of the K. into the handes of the D. of Neuers: who forgetting their fooliſh and raſh wordes receiued them, and aſſured them of their liues, and that their Towne ſhould not be burned: to that ende the Capitaines Duras, and Boiſſe, were ſent with their companies of French fanterie: but albeit that theſe companies were lodged there for their aſſurance and ſafetie, yet could they not warrant them from the ſacke: for the Almanes of the new leauie, imagining that theſe companies had bene gotten in only to haue the ſacke among them, ranne thither vpon a huddle, and broke open the gates with hatches, crowes, and great beames: the reſt which had not the patience to tarrie, crept vp, and ſcalled the walles, leaping in, in a number of places, where they made a maruellous peece of worke: and not content with this, vnderſtanding how they had cauſed all the woemen and young children to retire with certaine Cittizens into the great Church, they gathered together in troupes before it. And after that they had by violence beaten downe the gates, and porches of the temple: notwithſtanding any reſiſtance made to them by the French which were within, they rauiſhed and trayned out the men, women, maidens, and young children: ſo as for that cauſe was rayſed a crueell medly betweene them and the French which would haue put them out. The which endured all that night and vntill the next morrow in the morning vntill the King ſent expreſſely to appeaſe this mutinie. And afterwards it was proclaimed thoroughout the whole armie, that euery man vpon paine of death ſhould deliuer vp the women of Diſnan: which he cauſed to be nouriſhed vntill their departure with his own prouiſion, albeit that the ſouldiers themſelues were in great neceſſitie. After that the French were retired from the aſſault, the artillerie began on freſh to batter the Caſtle, to make the breach greater &amp; more eaſie, continuing the batterie all that night: while that they ſought other meanes to haue it by the fallings of the wall right againſt the breach making it more eaſie to clime. Notwithſtanding the 13. of Iuly about ſeuen of the clocke in the morning, they offred to parlie, and being admitted thereunto, there

came out firſt de Floyon gouernour of the Caſtle, and Hamon Captaine of the Almanes, who were conducted to the D. of Neuers tent: to whome hauing propoſed Articles, and it being reſolutely denied vnto them to carrie thence any weapon, artillerie, or enſigne, they agreed that they ſhould depart with ſworde and dagger, and ſome other trifling baggage. But Iulian the Capitane of the Spanniards, to keepe a kind of authoritie which that nation maketh it ſelfe much to be marked for in feates of armes, inſiſted with great perſwaſions that hee and his people might depart with their weapons: the which for all that the Conſtable would by no meanes graunt. Now while that they were reaſoning about this and ſundry other things, Bourdillon, and de Rabaudanges were ſecretly ſent to know, and conclude with the Spanniards whether they were willing to come foorth with like condition as the reſt: to which they moſt willingly conſented demaunding nothing but libertie. Wherefore the capitulation being brought backe to the Conſtable, ſigned, and accorded, was ſhewed to Iulian, who after the Spaniſh faſhion making great exclamation ſaid that he one of the chiefe and principall of all did not conſent nor approoue it: and required with great importunacie that he might be conueied backe againe to the Caſtle, which he vndertooke to keepe onely with his Spaniſh companies: the which of fauour was graunted vnto him, with proteſtation, that if he were taken by force, he ſhould hope for nothing but to be the firſt hanged at the gate. Whereupon by leaſure his choller was moderated: hauing occaſion to thinke rather of the danger wherein he ſtoode, then to ſhut himſelfe vp with his ſouldiers, which deſired nothing but comming forth one after an other: the K. being ſtill preſent, who tooke great pittie of them, the moſt part of them being ſo worne and tyred, as they looked like frighted bodies, and true Anatomies, thorough the paines and neceſsities which they had endured: the whole amounting to aboue 800. of all ſortes, and there dyed one another about eight ſcore, or two hundred. Tauannes his companie was appointed to conduct the reſt in ſafetie the way of Namur, and this Capitane Iulian was kept priſoner, not only for the aunſwere which he had made, but for an other more eſpeciall occaſion. This Caſtle was reputed amongſt one of the ſtrongeſt and faireſt houſes of the B. of Liege, with B. Eurarde, of the houſe of La Marche, vncle to Iamets then liuing, had cauſed to bee reedified, vpon the olde ruines, but farre more excellent and ſtrong then euer it was before: likewiſe ſundrie other as Hue, Franchemont, Stoquehan, Bouillon, and Floranges. It is ſcituate vpon an huge Rocke, which may be about &amp; of circumference neere fower hundred paces, iſſuing from the ſide of a mountaine of great ſcope, vpon the riuer of Meuſe in forme ouall: vnacceſsible two waies, on the Towne ſide and on the riuers: verie vneaſie likewiſe on the ſide wher the breach was made, vpon the two fronts are two bulwarks, in halfe circles, or as they commonly ſay in forme of horſe-ſhooes, the one vieweth and defendeth al the plaine of the mountaine, ſeruing for a platforme, the other aboue the Towne and riuer is almoſt in the ſame ſorte, ſauing that it was not ſo high, and the vpper parte made of Bricke, no whit at all rampired. Within the Caſtle is a ſquare court of about fortie pace in Diamiter and widthe, inuironed with three great core of houſes, of a maruailous faire building and workemanſhip: propped vp vnderneath with great colomes, the moſt part guilt, ſpecled all with white and graye ſpots, of which was likewiſe all the foundations made, and the vpper part of Bricke. The vnder ſtorie was all inuironed with faire and long galeries and walkes: and aboue were many great romes proper and well fitted with Chambers and a Chappell taking light towards the Towne: without towardes the North ſtoode theſe two round Towers, which the

Cannon ruined euen to the verie foundations: and below a courtaine or falſe braye flankered with Torions which was almoſt broken downe &amp; battered. At the roote of this great Rocke all along the riuer ſtoode the towne, well builded &amp; adorned with houſes, ſcituated moſt properly for the bringing of al kind of marchandiſe, eſpecially copper, braſſe, and all ſorte of ruſſet colours: on the other ſide of the riuer about 200. pace off ſtandeth the towne of Bouines which is not much leſſe then Diſnan, of the Countie of Namur, and it is found that in auncient time the two townes made warlike wars together. Diſnan holding the party of La Marche which was for France, and Bouines of Burgondie. Diſnan being a neuter town loſt her neutrality, for at the apetite of their B. vncle to the Emperor to ſubiect themſelues to one particular, who by violence (ſaid ſome) did vſurp the Biſhoppricke of Liege, frō the Abbot of Beaulieu to whom his ſaid vncle had reſigned it. Whereupon the humanity and ſweetnes of this Prince was much to be marked, who by no meanes would haue the towne of Diſnan burned as Bouines was, but had regard vnto the ſubiection which the Caſtle ſo much commanding ouer, alwaies had the towne in: &amp; therefore in the moſt faire and ſtrongeſt part thereof, it was by his owne fault beaten downe and battered, for euer after to be an example, that neuter lands, &amp; eſpecially of the Church ought not to be partiall or cleaue to any one more then another.
            Whilſt that theſe two armies ſtaied about Bouines &amp; Diſnā, the other of the Prince de La Rocheſurion burning al the country of Artois was ſundry daies skirmiſhed withall by a number of Flemmings which ſided &amp; followed him continually to interrupt his purpoſe: whereof the Prince being aduertiſed, &amp; of their courſes which they ſtill kept betweene Arras and Bapaume, came ſo fitly vpon thē that hauing wrapt them in vpon the way, he charged thē in ſuch ſort that there lay aboue 200. &amp; of their principall chefetaines ther were brought away priſoners, De Fama gouernor of the Citadel of Cambray and his Leiutenant, Varluſet Capitane of the light horſe: ſo as if it had not bene for a good horſe vpō which De Hauſimont gouernor of Bapaume was moū
               ted, he was in as great danger to haue borne them company. Two Cornets of their cauallery were there defeated &amp; taken which the Prince ſent vnto the K. wherby he might be the more aſſured of the aduantage which he had ouer his enemies. The 15. day of the moneth many French marchants which by riuer had brought victuals to the campe, hauing ſold thē, and going back againe to Meſieres with their botes laden with booties, &amp; certaine ſouldiers, and the Capitanes Garragoſſe, Gourdes, and La Mole hurt in the former aſſaults, were reencountred by the Bourguignons not far frō Giuets, &amp; conſtraining them to come abord, killed part and part, they carried away priſoners, among whom were theſe three captaines, to whom they made very faire war, &amp; gracious entertainmēt, ſending thē away vpō their faith.Engliſh &amp; Scotts takē at the ports of Giuets by the Bourguignons. At their departure thence vnderſtanding how at Giuets were certain Engliſh &amp; Scottiſh companies pertaining to the French, they ſuddenly went to ſurpriſe thē, and conſtrained them to retire into a houſe tenable enough, but brought away fowerſcore and ſixe of their horſes.
            The Emperor who as thē lay at Bruxelles neer enough, being aduertiſed of al this, and how the cōmon bruit of the camp went, that at their departure frō Diſnan they mēt to beſiege Namur, cauſed as many ſouldiers to be lodged ther as he eſtemed neceſſary, knowing it otherwiſe but meanely fortefied for any artificial fortification, and that as a great number of men were needful for the aſſailing of ſo great townes, ſo as great &amp; careful diligence for their defence to be requiſite. Seing in like ſort all the cō
               mons of the plaine countrie ſo moued &amp; out of hart as all was abandoned he ſent his nephew the D. of Sauoy for his Leiutenant general, with as many ſouldiers as he was

recouer, readily to emparke himſelfe in the towne ſide in a place called Giuelou, betweene the two riuers of Meuſe, &amp; Sambre, wher he got together and aſſembled his army with extreme diligence: hauing ſent for ſuccours out of al places. As ſone as the Prince was fortefied in this place, he ſcattered his Cauallerie vpon the way where he thought the victuals would paſſe for the French, as wel to weaken thē and giue them occaſiō to retire, as to learne &amp; know their determination cauſing a bruit to be ſowne, reported by ſpies and priſonners, that if they aduentured to march further, or to paſſe the riuer of Sambre to enter into Henault, he would preſent himſelfe a hed to giue thē battel.The Emperours armie vnder the prince of Piemont. But the K. as not being ſo far entred into his enemies countrie to returne without paſſing further, hauing likewiſe left the way of Namur, ſtaied to paſſe ouer the riuer of Sambre, &amp; to burne the countrie of Henault, whereby he might make proofe of the imperiall forces: frō whence ſuch being returned as went to view the places &amp; way which the army muſt paſſe thorough, hauing ſent backe Bourdillon with his companie to Meſieres to cauſe certain Bourgingnons to retire, which burned certaine villages about, the K. raiſed his army from this place the 16. of Iuly to continue his determination: knowing notwithſtanding the difficulty to recouer victuals, &amp; how the enemie had gotten al within their ſtrong townes, &amp; broken down al mils, he thought good to aduertiſe the whole companies, to make prouiſion of as much victuals as was poſſible, euen ſo farre as to lade their horſes with prouiſion: the D. of Neuers remaining vpon the Meuſe ſide, as wel to make the ſurplus of prouiſions to be diſtributed, as to tarrie the rayſure of the Caſtle of Diſnan, and of all the reſt of the ſmall fortes about, whence he departed the 18. day of that month, and went to finde the King at Storne a ſmall village, where the Lord of the place, as he was ready to goe to dinner, was ſurpriſed by the light horſe. The next morning, at their diſlodging, that was ſet on fire, and all the villages round about. Now as the armie lying betweene theſe two riuers there was no meanes honorably to retire, but by the iſſue of an happie combat, ſo already and reſolute for the ſhow, marched in battell ſtraight to this riuer. Their couriers notwithſtanding hauing giuen as farre as the brinkes of La Sambre, founde not ſo much as one ſole man to make them reſiſtance, and paſſed forwards freely ſo as the whole cauallerie followed after, then the 
                  ••
               nterie and men at armes without the loſſe of any one vallet, were it not by ſome other accident. Likewiſe the imperials not finding themſelues ſtrong enough as then, contained themſelues cloſe within their fort, and inſteede of going out to ſeeke them, they were ſhut in and fortefied with good trenches the beſt that was poſsible. Notwithſtanding that night there were certaine troupes of their cauallerie diſcouered, which preſently drew backe into the woodes, hauing perceiued a number of French companies, which were ready to accoſt them. So the poore popular people abuſed with the hope, which they imagined of the imperiall armie, were ſurpriſed within their houſes, with a mightie number of cattell, &amp; other moueables, not without great pittie: all the plaine countrie being ſet on fire and extreamely ruined, eſpecially one little Towne called Forces, within the countie of Aſſebais. This night they encamped on this ſide the riuer in a Copice, where the whole armie kept cloſe and well vnited, perceiuing the imperials to be but one league and a halfe of. The twentie day of the moneth the French armie beganne to make her entrie ſo furiouſly within the countries of Hanault, that there was nothing but fire, cries, flightes, and all thinges pittifull to heare, but much more to ſee, without ſo much as one burrow daring to make reſiſtance. All the people flying away from the reencounter of this horrible furie, which continued vntill euentide, that they encamped in the village of Iumets, very famous for

the two new forts which were there: frō one of which a number of imperials hauing bene aduanced thither to cut off the victuals from the army, had already giuē the ſlip at the bruit of the vauntcouriers. Theſe Caſtles were in the ſtrongeſt places ruined &amp; raiſed. In this place the K. did an act worthie of a moſt Chriſtian Prince: for hauing beene told him by a guidon of the D. of Neuers company how a poore woman his hoſteſſe was deliuered of a faire ſonne, himſelfe would needs be godfather, carried it vnto the Font, &amp; their cauſed the Cardinall of Lorraine to Baptiſe it by the name of Henrie, beſtowing certaine preſents of him: beſides that he made it be writtē ouer the houſe dore, to the end it might not be deſtroied nor ruined with the reſt. Thus is the houſe where the K. Chriſtned the child. This night the comte Roquendolphe with his piſtoliers, his regiment of Almanes, the D. of Bouillons companie,An act of a moſt chriſtian K. &amp; two ſmall field peeces, vndertooke to goe ſurpriſe the little Towne of Niuelle, the firſt town of Brabant: notwithſtanding finding it better furniſhed with men of war then he ſuppoſed he returned without doing ought elſe then burning the ſuburbs and villages abouts: frō whence he broght away great booties. At their diſlodging thence the army drew ſtraight to Bains one of the principal townes of Hennault, leauing for all the waies behinde it nothing but flames of fire, ſmoke and all kind of calamitie: whome the D. of Sauoy ſtill followed with the imperiall army from lodging to lodging: giuen at their tayle as many alarums as he was able, to annoy and weaken thē, being of himſelf grieued enough to heare and ſee the plaints of the miſerable common people ſo deſtroyed &amp; ruined: to whom he could giue no other comfort, but ſay that they ſtill fled before him, &amp; he followed ſtil after to be reuenged of thē. An occaſiō that the ſame day they encamped about Bains wher they lightned far greater fires then the firſt,The imperial armie followeth the French from place to place. for that there were ſpoyled &amp; conſumed to aſhes the moſt faire Caſtles and gentlemens houſes, which were poſsible to be builded. Among the reſt the moſt ſumtuous houſe of Marimont was ſet on fire, curiouſly builded for the ſingular pleaſure of Q. Mary, furniſhed with as many ſingularities as was poſſible to be imagined. An other excellent faire Caſtle, called Tragny was burned and the greateſt part ruined,Marimont a houſ of pleaſure to Q. Mar
                     •
                  e burned. where were found ſundry moueables and rich veſtements as well of men as women. The 22. of Iuly the Towne of Bains being ſummoned, and no waies willing to yeeld, was moſt furiouſly preſented with the Cannon, and in another manner of ſorte then when D'Alegre loſt his life there. Which hauing endured out ſixe volleyes of the Cannon, yeelded themſelues to the Kinges mercie, who for all that commaunded it to bee deſtroyed and burned, not forgetting his Caſtle of Foulembray and other Townes of Picardie, which Q. Marie had before cauſed to be burned &amp; entirely ruined, at ſuch time as he was in Germanie. They did as much to a ſumtuous Caſtle which ſhe had newly cauſed to be built, repleniſhed with all exquiſite things as of ſundrie varieties of Marble, Tables, plate pictures, and emboſt ſtatues, colours of all ſortes, whereof notwithſtanding in ſmal ſpace was made great waſt &amp; deſtruction. De Bloſſe who was gouernour thereof was brought away priſonner, with the chiefeſt of marke which were found both there and within the towne: the K. ſtill vſing all meekenes towards the women, young maidens &amp; litle children, which he made be conducted &amp; put in ſafty, by a Harrowld, &amp; a trumpetor. Afterwards the ſame morning de Giry Leiutenāt of the D. of Neuers company, was ſent with 4. other companies of men at armes, to keepe ſcoute to thoſe, which ſet fire on the Caſtle of Reux, which the late maiſter therof had cauſed to be reedified, and better maſonned then euer it was, when it was firſt builded, beeing vowted from the bottome to the toppe: from thence they were at Bais ſur Bais a village: afterwards at a litle towne of Bauets, very anucient firſt builded by the Troians, (as they of the country tell) which paſſed beyond the foreſt

of Mormant, calling it after the name of their Prince Bauo. At this time ſmally inhabited, but to ruine it the more fire was put in many places. The imperial armie ſtil followed thē very neere, being better ſtrengthned as well by the ſuccours of Almanes which the D. of Brunſwich brought, of 2000. Reiſtres, which they cal in France Piſtoliers, as for that all the Emperors Garriſons, which hee had diſtributed among the towns which he had left behind were retired thither. The which cauſed the French to march in better order, &amp; cloſer then before: as alwaies ready to fight, frō one place to another, for doubt of the enemy, being very vigilant, ſubtil &amp; couragious, wher he could ſpie any aduantage to aſſaile thē: whereat the Conſtable well aduiſing, to ſupport the charges, &amp; enterpriſes, which the enemie might giue vpō their skirts, ordinarily remained there with the vauward, and diſlodged euer laſt. Thus the alarums redoubled at their departure thence, hauing as it were couped thēſelues in betwene ſix great Towns of their enemies to wit Mons in Haynault, Auanes, Landrecy, Lequeſnoy, Valenciennes, &amp; Cambray, and the imperiall armie which was at their heeles, &amp; had aſſailed them as by a diſpaire had not been the good conduct of their chefes the imperials hauing aduentred ſo far as in clere day to force their whatch, after they had ſurpriſed one of the ſentinels of Tauannes his company: notwithſtāding not daring to aduenture further, as ſone as they were perceiued, they were driuen in as farre as Lequeſnoy. Now this night their light cauallery skirmiſhed long, &amp; with lucke enough, which was a cauſe to make thē forbeare, &amp; take ſom reſt the ſurplus of that night. Hauing then frō Villie encamped at Souleine, and frō thence at the burrowes &amp; Caſtle of Gommigny which they burned, they marched forward the 24. of the month, whē as their enemies as it were deſperate, in ſeing their country burned, deſtroied &amp; ſacked by thē, without any doubt of being followed, or feare of being famiſhed, propoſed to giue thē a charge, taking vantage of the raynie &amp; miſty weather: knowing likewiſe that they had two reaſonable bad riuers, to paſſe which were ſwelled that night where they hoped to delay thē and put thē in ſuch dioder, as they would haue them at deuotion hauing all their own garriſons ioyned together. Therefore they deuided into two troupes about 4000. of the beſt horſe they had, laying part of thē in ambuſh within the woods vpon the way, &amp; part of them within certaine villages at hand according as they might moſt cōmodiouſly ſuſtaine one another, the D. of Sauoy remaining behind with other 4000 horſe &amp; ſome footmen, hauing belaid the field with 4. or 5. hūdred couriers to entiſe forth their light horſe: wherby they being firſt diſcouered by the D. D' Aumale,
               The imperials enterpriſes vpon the French armie it was thought fit to ſend to the Marſhall S. Andre, who remained at their taile with two regiments of men at armes to know if it were beſt to charge thē: who ſent back word that he was not of that opiniō, fearing they had a greter company. Wherefore Paul Baptiſta, &amp; the capitane Lanque were ſent to view them more neere: who made report each one of his ſide that they had deſcried two other troupes of 2000. horſe a peece which anon after as ſoone as the wether grew clearer, diſcouered thēſelues at ful, &amp; ſo neere as they attacked skirmiſh with the light cauallery of the French hard by the camp, without ſetting, or giuing in earneſt vpon any of the other ranks of cauallery, and men at armes: which made thē hedlong enough, &amp; in their view retired and paſſed this laſt riuer: afterwards they returned without carrying the honour to haue had any aduantage at all ouer them. The regiment of the Duke of Neuers was ſent another way, where certaine of their ſcoutes were defeated, which brought great quantitie of baggage, but parte thereof was againe reſkewed. Afterwardes they encamped that night in a village, which the yeere before had beene burned called Viellie. The ſame day a trumpetour which the Duke of Neuers had ſent to the campe, called La Capelle, to vnderſtand what was become of

a man at armes of his company, returned almoſt al naked, &amp; ſtript by ſome ſouldiers of the enemies, ſmally experiēced in feates of war. But at the inſtant he was ſent backe againe in the ſame eſtate, with a trumpetor, who was charged by the K. to tel the D. of Sauoy, the Emperors Leiutenant general, that if hereafter they vſed any more the like faſhions, &amp; al the priueledges &amp; liberties of war ſhold be thus aboliſhed, he wold do the like at his next ſiege. Which being vnderſtood by this gentle Prince, to ſhew how ſore he was diſpleaſed therat, he cauſed diligent ſearch to be made thoroughout his whole campe, for thoſe as had cōmitted ſo baſe and lewd an act, to haue thē puniſhed in example: ſo as hauing recouered the trumpetors clothes &amp; horſe with recō
               pence for ſuch other things as had beene taken frō him, he cauſed him to be ſafely cō
               ueied backe by one of his owne. Now for that ſome of the imperials had cauſed the bruite to run, how that the French did flie before thē, &amp; that if they woulde but ſtay 24. howers, the Prince ſhold giue thē battel, they anſwered, that they ſaw no cauſe to be ſo brag, nor ſo lightly to vſurp ſuch glory, occaſion of cōbat hauing already beene often enough preſented vnto them if they themſelues had liſted. Notwithſtanding if the Prince had ſo great deſire thereto as he made ſhew for, he aſſured them on the K. behalfe, that he would ſtay full 24. howers &amp; no more, or if he would come find him out neer Cambray, he did aſſure him that would tarry for him 8. daies together, wher nothing ſhould be refuſed him. But whilſt they ſought out the moſt cōmodious places to lodge their battellons &amp; men at armes, the imperials in the end retired to their firſt lodgings neere to Bauets. An occaſion that at their departure thence the French with one march got as far as Craeuecaeur neere Cambray, where the enemies had determined to fortefie and repaire the Caſtle, hauing already begun to make certaine trenches &amp; conduits to taſt the water, purpoſing there to lay their foundations which the ſame day being the 26. of Iuly, their pioners began to raiſe: where the firſt wound of the miſerable Cambreſius was renued, who had already ſet vp &amp; builded ſome little cottages, only to keepe thēſelues dry: imagining that a long time there would not ſo great misfortune befal them, hauing according to their habilitie againe ſowed part of their fields, to haue wherwith all to nouriſh, and keepe themſelues from famine: ſo as the richer ſort, &amp; glad to that they were with their beſt moueables retired within the ſtrong townes, were not exempt out of al theſe loſſes &amp; aduerſities: for whē the tennant is poore &amp; afflicted, the Lord fareth neuer a whit of ought the better. Now whilſt that in the plain countrie they made waſt of Corne alredy ripe, &amp; ready to be reaped, many braue ſalies and skirmiſhes dayly fel out between them of Cambray &amp; the French: the Citadel ſtil troubling &amp; darkning the aire with ſhot of Cānon, which lighted only among the worſt ſort, without ſlaying of any perſon of renowne: which they did only by al meanes poſſible, ſeeking to hinder the loſſe &amp; ruine of their fruits, being notwithſtanding often enough repelled and driuen into their owne gates, ſo as theſe bickerings continued for the ſpace of 8. daies, whilſt that the French lay ther encamped. The imperiall armie in the meane time was pitched and fortefied in a place called Arçon betweene Cambray, Le Queſnoy, &amp; Valeciennes vpon the little riuer of Montet, which commeth towards the Caſtle of Cambreſy, &amp; a little lower falleth into Leaſcau, ſtill continuing their courſes to cut off the waies: which the Prince De La Roche Sur-yon well perceiuing came thither, incorporating his armie with the K. which hee ſuccoured with great quantitie of victuals, whereof they ſtoode in great want and neceſsitie.
            In this time was the marriage concluded betweene Philip of Auſtria, and Mary of England, though with much more honor to the Engliſh, then to the Spanniards: hauing

taken from him by the contract of marriage,Marriage of Philip of Auſtria &amp; Mary Q. of England. many commodities which ordinarily are proper and incident vnto a husband, yea ſo farre as to denie vnto him the curteſie of England which carrieth. That a Queene enheritrice to England, comming to be married to a Prince ſtranger,Courteſie of England. and afterwards dying, the husband ſhoulde enioy ſuch goods as appertained vnto her during his life, though no heires at al were iſſued by marriage: wherein likewiſe may be very well noted the power of the eſtates and Parliament of England, ouer the diſpoſition whether liuing or teſtamentarie of their Prince. This marriage notwithſtanding, though very honorable to their nation, yet ſtucke ſore in the minds of many Lords and other of the countrie as well for the diſpleaſure which they tooke in that they were to be commaunded by a ſtranger, as for the change of Religion and pollicie, already as it were growne olde and ſetled in the harts of many: ſo as with a full reſolution to hinder the ſame, and to ſet vp Iane of Suffolke as Queene, they roſe in armes vnder Henrie of Suffolke, Thomas Wyat and ſundrie other as well in Cornewale as the North countrie. Wyat vndertooke to bring his men ſtraight to London chiefe Citie of the Realme, hoping to draw the Londoners vnto him vnder a pretext of the countries libertie, &amp; hinderance of the alliance with a ſtranger. The Q. on the other ſide hauing leuied a great number of men cauſed the Duke to flie to Warwicke, from whence ſeeking to eſcape into Fraunce, hee was apprehended and brought to London by the Earle of Huntington, who marched againſt Wyat, gathering men out of the Dutchie of Norfolke, the Duke whereof being taken priſonner by Wyat, in no caſe would be perſwaded to combat with this partie, but afterwards being releaſed, hee reuealed vnto the Q. all the enterpriſe of Wyat and his partners: with whome ſtoode likewiſe ſuſpected and kept as priſonner, Elizabeth daughter to Henry and Anne Boulen. Wyat notwithſtanding being ariued at London was much aſtonied. But the Queene though with ſmall force, hauing publikely to all men rendred the cauſe, which moued her to take the Spanniard to her husband, and how that the countrie ſhould there by receiue much more good, then by her alone, or any other Engliſh Prince: beſides; how ſhe would looſe nothing of her owne, nor any waies diminiſh the libertie of her ſubiectes, encouraged them ſo farre as Wyat cleane out of hope of entring the Cittie, and ſeeking to retire into Kent, being purſued was defeated by the Earle of Penbrooke: afterwards brought to London,Iane of Suffolke and her husband with ſundry other beheadded at London. within ſhort ſpace, both the D. of Suffolke and himſelfe, had their heads cut off, being not long after followed by Iane of Suffolke and her husband, for not hauing refuſed, the vnfortunate Crowne which was offred vnto them. Thus began the marriage of Marie, with th' effuſion of her ſubiectes bloud, as almoſt all the reſt of her Raigne conſumed in diuiſion: and full of murther and puniſhments of the moſt notable perſonages of her Realme. Theſe troubles being appeaſed the Prince of Spaine ariued about the end of Iuly in the Ile of Wight: from whence being honorably conducted by my L. Paget and other, entring afterwards further in to England, followed by the D. of Alua, Earles of Padille, Rigomes, &amp; Aiguemont, the Admiral of Caſtile, and Marquis of Languillare, the mariage was ſolemniſed the 23. of Iuly at Wincheſter, wher Maſſe being finiſhed, the Emperors deputies declared how in fauour of that marriage, his Maieſtie did giue vnto his ſonne the realme of Naples, Sicilie, and Ieruſalem, the Dutchies of Milan, Burgondie, Brabant, the Earledomes of Aſpur, Flanders, and Tiroll.
            
               Henrie in this meane while, cōtinuing ſtil ready &amp; vpon his guard cauſed in the great plain betwene Craeuecaeur and Cambray a generall muſter to be made of al his men at armes and French Cauellerie, about the month of Iuly whilſt that his footmen &amp;

cariadges had gained the aduantage, and paſſed the Riuer, for ſome companies of light horſe being ſent forth for watch and ſcoutes, returned word back how that they had diſcouered neere hand to a foure or fiue hundred horſe, and a great number of foote, making ſhew as though the Emperours Campe marched, keeping their way as though they went directlye to Cambray, whereof they were no ſooner aduertiſed, then likewiſe ready, with reſolution rather to fight it out in the fielde, then to permit or giue them leaue to fortifie ſo neere vnto them, eſpecially with the helpe and ſuccour of ſo great a Towne, whereby as much miſcheefe might happen vnto them as did vnto the Proteſtants of Germanie before Ingolſtat, whereupon the D. D' Aumale remounted ſuddenly on horſeback with the light Cauallerie, the better to be aſſured of the truth, and found how the imperial army was indeed remoued with full determination to come and encampe neer Cambray, but that the Emperor knowing how they were not departed thence, fearing to be enforced to fight to his great diſaduantage, lodged in another place neere vnto the firſt, called Neuuille, which hee cauſed ſoddenly to be renforced with trenches on that ſide, which was not flancked to the riuer.
            This night at ſundry times were fent out ſome companies of French Cauallerye, and of the Admirals men at armes to keepe them in continuall alarmes within their forte, vntill the break of day next morning, that the Conſtable with the moſt parte of the men at armes of his vantguarde, and two Regimentes of French Fanterie went neere to view and ſee if there were any meanes to force them within their forte, or to entice and giue them occaſion to come forth. But he found that very hard, for that this place was two waies encloſed with the riuer, and on the other ſides wel fortified and trenched in, aſſuring himſelfe by the diſcourſe of naturall reaſon, and examples paſt, that for the ſmalnes of reſolution which would be had therin, he could not carry away more honor and profite, then hee had done at other times, and in his yong yeeres at La Bicoque a ſimple Country houſe, of leſſe ſtrength then the place where the Marqueſſe of Gnaſt defeated all the fury of the French, Zuizers, and other partakers of the Flower de luce. True it is that in his returne hee eſpyed ſome olde Towers where ſundrye of the enemyes were lodged on this ſide their Campe, as well to keepe ſcoute, as to endamage the fouragers: whereupon it was concluded that the Cannon ſhould be brought thither the ſame day to the battrie; by this meanes the rather to prouoke the Emperour to come forth to guarde and defende them. But the imperialls cleane acquited them retiring within their fort. Notwithſtanding to giue all occaſions which might bee, as alſo doubting the deſcent of the Engliſh into the countrie of Boulonnois, the marriage hauing beene alreadie ſolemnized betweene the K. of Spaine, and their Queene, Henry determined to make his armie vnto thoſe partes. where accordyng as the commoditie preſented it ſelfe, he might beſiege on of his enemies holdes, to the end that if hee would put himſelfe into the fielde and ſtriue to reſcue it, the Emperour might bee thereby conſtrained to fight. Hauing then ſoiourned certaine daies at Creueceur neare to Cambray, the ſecond of Auguſt hee departed, and the ſame day went to encampe at Ondrecourt nere the Caſtelet, whereof the Emperour being aduertiſed, raiſed his armie from Neuuille, and taking his way towards Arras, pitched at Marteau, The day after the French were at Mornencourt, two leagues from Peronne, and the next morrow paſſed before Bapalme ſaluted with infinite ſhot of Cannon. Notwithſtanding the armie made no long aboade there through the diſcommodity which they founde in not being able to recouer water: but onlie the light horſe ſkirmiſhed ſomtime before that place

whileſt that the whole army deſcended to encampe that night all along the little Riuer vnderneath Mirammont; whence they departed the next daye, keeping theyr way all along the borders of the Countie of Artois, where they ſawe a wonderfull waſte which the Prince of Roche Sur-yon his army had made ſundrye faire Caſtles and Villages as yet ſmoaking, the Corne and fruites of the earth clean deſtroyed and abandoned, which are the miſeries and calamities that the warres and diſſentions betweene Princes bring to poore people. That night being the 5. of Auguſt, they encamped Paz in Artois; where ſome cauallerie of the Garriſon of Arras keeping alongſt the woods and couered cuntry, vndertook to free about vpon the hinder part, but being encountered with their Engliſh and Scottiſh Cauallery, were defeated, and the moſt parte of their Souldiers diſmounted, and other brought away priſonners, whereby the loſſe of Giuettes was now recompenced. There they made great waſte, and continued it as farre as the abbey of Cercamp, where the County of S. Poul beginneth; there they ſoiourned two dayes for many reaſons, eſpeciallye for that they had reſolued to beſiege the Caſtle of Renty.The K. army before Rentry and his deſſeines. The D. of Vendoſme departed thence with a good number of Cauallerie and foote, training ſome artillerie to goe before to ſummon it; alſo to knowe whether any bodye were lefte within Fauguemberg, which he purpoſed to raze, with all other ſmall fortes adioyning; to the end likewiſe that he might be able to bring greater ſtore of artillerie, that which he had there being partly homecomed, partly cracked and diſmounted, much powder and munition hauing beene ſpent before the Townes and Caſtles which they had taken; the eight of Auguſt they trauerſed all the Countye of S. Poul, leauing Dorlan and Hedin on the left hand, and Terroanne on the right, to encampe the night following at Fruges; whence that night the Caſtle of Renty was againe ſummoned, and anſwere made by the Captaine,The Emperour before Renty &amp; his diſſeines. that he would neuer yeelde it vp, aſſuring himſelf of the ſuccours which the Emperour would bring vnto him; who being informed of the K. comming thither, as well in reſpect that forte was very preiudiciall to the County of Boulonnois, as to aſſay if they would hazard to fight with him and driue him out of the Countrie, was departed from Arras, where hee had muſtered all his forces, with which he approched as neere vnto the King as Terroanne on the Friday at night. But the French knowing his intent to be to keepe on the other ſide of the Riuerh, a place ſtrong by reaſon of the length &amp; bredth of the wods which ſtretched very far into the country, wherby ſuccors might come vnto him as well of victuals as Souldiers, and all other ſorts of munitions, and being there fortified, his preſence would eaſily ſuccour and reskew the Caſtle with whatſoeuer ſhould be needfull, yea of all ſides readye to cutte of and annoye the beſiegers, aduiſed for the more ſure, that the Conſtable with the Vantgarde ſhould paſſe into that part, and fortefie himſelfe with trenches, to bemeete with and preuent all occaſions of ſurpriſe; and to cut of the way to any ſuccours which might be ſent vnto the Caſtle, bridges and boates were made vpon the little Riuer, whereby the two Campes might the more eaſily ſuccour one another. Afterwards all the light cauallerie being encamped at Fauquemberge, this caſtle remained ſo penned in, as there was not one man able to enter in without being diſcouered; notwithſtanding the better to aſcertaine the Emperour of this ſiege, they cauſed to be planted on the toppe of a mountain on Montereul ſide foure Culuerins, to begin to batter theſe defences, whileſt they aduanced forward ſuch great peeces as were taken and brought from the Townes aboue the Riuer of Somme, which came thither ſomewhat late, and only the Satterday at night, but to make amends to this ſloath, they made the approches with ſuch ſpeede, as all was ſeene in

batterie by the next morrowe, notwithſtanding any ſhower of Harquebuze ſhotte, which they were able to ſend out of the Caſtle, whence there was hurte the Captaine Vauquedemars, one of the moſt ancienteſt and experimented Captaines of the olde Enſignes, the which redoubled vnto the Emperour his doubt and feare of the place, ſeeing himſelfe without all meanes or hope to be able ſo much as to cauſe one man to enter in: but in the end the greefe and ſhame which hee conceaued, to ſuffer his Country ſo to be deſtroyed, and before his eyes, and that this place ſhould be taken and enforced, ſo mingled themſelues together, that making himſelfe an enemy to his feare, he reſolued to trye fortune, and to doe his beſt whatſoeuer ſhould enſue thereon to ſuccour it. Thereupon the ſame day he came to encampe hard by the French, but for all that the artillery neuer ceaſed moſt furiouſlye to batter the Caſtle, and that in two places, to wit, on the Conſtables ſide and on the Kinges, the artillerie being aduanced, and planted on the very brinke of the ditch, which battered a bulwarke on the left hand, and a round tower within the dungeon on the right; they ſhot likewiſe from the mountaine a little below the Zuizers Campe, with foure culuerins to break the defences, and you may not doubt but in ſhort time this caſtle was as violently battered and cannoned, as any other place, ſo as the Emperour determined as the beſt way to raiſe them as yet to approche neerer, and ſo lodged on the top, on the plaine of a mountaine, betweene a little Village called Marque and Fauquemberg, where there was but one little Valley of an hundred and fiftye pace large, and at the leaſt as ſteepe, which deuided the two armies, and the valley on the other ſide, wher the riuer runneth which maketh a mariſh, and ouerfloweth al round about the Caſtle on the right hand. Beſides a wood on the left betweene the Spaniard and the French, aboue Fauquemberg, called the wood William,The Emperours and K. Henries deſſeines before Reinty. which the Emperor thought good to ſeaſe vpon to hinder their giuing of the aſſaulte, and to compell them by ſhot of Cannon into their campe, to diſlodge and quit the place. Now had the D. of Guiſe which commaunded in the battaile watched all that night, as alſo the Prince of Ferrara, the D. of Neuers, the Admirall, the Marſhall de S. Andre, and other, aſſuring themſelues that the enemye would not faile to ſpye out the wood to lodge in, and therefore was there ſet about 300. Harquebuſiers in ambuſh, within certaine little caues, and ſome corſelets which ſtoode plaine to be diſcouered, to the end the enemies firſt addreſſing themſelues to fight with them, might be encloſed in, the eaſier to be defeated by the Harquebuziers: and ſo a little after at the point of day, the ſcouts reported how they had heard a great noiſe, and deſcried certain matches of Harquebuziers, the which himſelfe afterwardes perceiuing, forbad them to diſcouer themſelues, but to tarrie vntill they might be ſure, and vpon that went back into the corps de gnet, which was retyred in the plaine towardes the Campe. The Imperials ſtill marched forward within the wood, according to the reporte of ſome couriers, which they ſtill ſent before, and perceiuing nothing, went ſo far in that they found themſelues encloſed within this ambuſh, not as yet diſcouered: wherefore the French ſuddenly all at one inſtant diſcharged ſo hottely on them, that they remained in the end ſo aſtonied and beaten, as in ſeeing a number hurt, they began to flye and turne their backes, glad that the day was no further forwardes, and that the weather was miſtye. Now from the beginning of the daye the batterye was continued more furious then before, ſo as in a ſhorte ſpace the breaches in euery place grewe reaſonable ready to giue the aſſaulte: whereof the Emperour being aduertiſed, hee was ſo angry, as the very ſame day being the 13. of Auguſt, about noone he made a volley of artillerie to be diſcharged, to giue them warning within that they ſhould be of courage,

and that their ſuccours were at hand. Afterwardes hauing concluded to giue battaile, (againſt the aduice of the principall of his councell) he cauſed all his campe to be ſet in order, but he reſolued firſt to gaine the wood, knowing the importance thereof, and at all hazards to chafe away the French. Therefore hauing choſen out of all his companies of foote about three or foure thouſand Harquebuziers of the beſt experienced,The Imperial army to giue battaile to the French. ſome corſelettes, and Pikemen to ſupporte them, and about foure thouſand horſe, with foure fielde peeces, carried vpon foure wheeles, ready to turne them vpon any hand, (whereby they were afterward called the Emperours Piſtols) he cauſed them all to march right into the wood, the light Cauallerie vnder the conduct of the Duke of Sauoy, and the Harquebuziers vnder Dom-Ferrant de Gonzague. All along the Glade of the wood in deſcending towardes Fauquemberg marched a battaile of Almanes, ledde by the Count Iohn of Naiſſau, and the Marſhal of Cleues, on whoſe flancke marched a troupe of Reiſtres of about eighteene hundred or two thouſand horſe, vnder the conduct of the Count Vulfenfort, who promiſed the Emperour to march that day vpon the bellye of all the Kinges men at armes; followed not farre of with a number of light cauallerie, of about one thouſand or twelue hundred horſe, with foure fielde peeces more. The Harquebuziers then being entred into the wood, encountred with the three hundred French, as freſh and with as good a will to recharge them as they had done at the firſt. And therevpon grew faire and hot skirmiſhes. Now albeit that the Imperials arriued there in farre greater number, yet they behaued themſelues ſo valiantly that they kept them a long time back, ſo as many remained on eche ſide as well dead as hurt, and taken priſonners: among other of the French, the Captaine Fort, and his Lieutenant Courcelles. Hereupon the Duke of Guiſe, who from the beginning had vndertaken the defence of this wood, and by his preſence animated and ſeemed to grace theſe martiall actions, hauing carefully conſidered of the whole deſſein of the Imperialles, aduiſed the King that by their countenance and fury wherewith they went to the combate, hee verily thought that that day ſhould not paſſe without a battaile. The King then which was in the plaine on this ſide the wood, about 5000. pace in length, and 2000. in breadth, cauſed his battailes of foote to be put in order, to ſcituate them in a place commoudious and eaſie to combate with the men at armes, becauſe that place was vnproper for them both together,The French army repreſented before Renty to giue battaile. as by the aduice of the Conſtable and ſundry other Princes and Captaynes, he had the day before perceaued. Notwithſtāding for the better countenance and to make head to the enemy, there was lodged both the one and the other as commodiouſlye as could be; the firſt battell of foote were French, the ſecond Almanes, the third Zuizers, which followed one another with Regiments of men at armes ordained for their flancke on their right hand. And for as much as on the lefte there was a little Valley, which as well from the quarter of the Zuizers towards Fauquemberg, as towards the wood, widening made a glade eaſie and commodious enough, as wel to lodge foote as horſe, in the opening of that plaine they ſet the moſt parte of the reſt of the Regimentes of men at armes for the other flancke. And right before towards Fauquemberg was the D. D'aumale with all the light Cauallerie, and certaine Harquebuziers on foote to fight, without keeping any order, to the end they might giue notice if the enemy ſhould come that way. And in the mean ſpace the Duke of Guiſe not being able readily to haue the K. anſwere vpon ſuch occurrents, being likewiſe no leſſe curious to draw the enemie into the place moſt aduantagious for himſelfe, then fearefull of the loſſe of the three hundred Harquebuziers in the wood, in the end reſolued to make them retire from place to place, through the trauerſes of

the wood, euer refreſhing them with ſome companies of Cauallery, which notwithſtanding ſo encreaſed the imperials courage, as aſſuring themſelues of victorye, they cauſed their battailes of Alamanes to march with al diligence which alwaies flankred them on the rightſide, as they ſawe their harquebuſiers haue aduauntage ouer the French. And euen then Dom-Ferrant ſent word vnto the Emperour that he ſhould haſten the reſt of his army, for the Vantgarde of the French ſaid he was already ſore ſhakened, ready to ſet themſelues in diſorder: the which the Emperour did, and his army paſſed all along the Valley aboue, and at one of the corners of the wood himſelfe tarried, to be partaker of the pleaſure or annoy of the good or bad which ſhould fall out: it was then as the K. anſwere came to the D. of Guiſe, that if occaſion offred it ſelfe to receaue battaile, he ſhould not refuſe it; that he would come himſelfe thither in perſon with as good a will to fight, as the moſt valiant of his whole army. Then the Duke of Guiſe went back to his Regiment in the ſight and face of all vppon the plaine towards Fauquēberg; where of a famous warrier,The D. of Guiſes ſpeech to the gentlemen of his company. gratious notwithſtanding and with a ſmiling countenance, hee vſed ſome words, as well to aduertiſe the Gentlemen, of the faire occaſion which that day was offred to attaine honour, as to encourage thoſe which might haue any neede; and ſhewed them all in generall, how the day was come wherein God preſented vnto them (in doing ſeruice to their Princes and encreaſing their honor and particular reputation) the matter and true ſubiect, to make themſelues for euer to be redoubted and feared of all the nations of the worlde, whereof the K. aſſured himſelfe ſo farre, as he would honour this glorious victory with his owne preſence, which indeed encouraged them in ſuch ſorte, as hauing called vpon the name of God, and recōmended their ſoules into his hands,The K. anſwere to the Zuizers euery man prepared himſelfe well and faithfully to perfourme his dutie. In the mean time the Conſtable paſſed ouer the riuer towards the Duke with a Regiment of the Captaine Glamay his footmen, who cauſed the firſt order a little to be altered; and retired the battaile of Zuizers towards Renty, who according to their ancient cuſtome, ſent vnto the King to demaund ſome men at armes to ſupporte them, but the K. anſwered them, how himſelfe would liue and dye with them, and that he ſo farre aſſured himſelfe of their promiſe and good will, that he determined no whit to abandon them, reſolute to ſhew vnto them, how as well in life, as point of death, if it were offred he would honour them as his colleagues and faithfull freends both to himſelfe and his kingdome: whereat they were ſo ſtirred vp, as there was no other intention among them, but to fight valiantlye for his ſeruice. Likewiſe as a teſtimonye of the pleaſure which the King receiued therein, he did that which I will ſhew you in another place. As all this was thus a handling, the Imperials were in ſuch ſort already advanced vpon the French, as they had recoyled them, and driuen thē out of the wood ſo farre, as their harquebuziers began to come forth, and ſhew themſelues in front of the firſt battail of the French, ready to ioyne with them, pelting at them with a continuall and maruellous noyſe of Harquebuze ſhot all along the glade. The Imperial battaile ſupported with Piſtoliers and cauallerie, was aproched with one hundred pace of the French, and there remained nothing but to charge, at ſuch time as the D. of Guiſe gaue a ſigne to the D. of Nemours, to charge with his regiment of light Cauallerie vpon one of the corners of the Piſtoliers, and vpon the other hee ſet the Guidon of his owne company, and Tauannes to ſcoure on their ſlancke, whereupon there began a moſt ſore and furious combat; but the French were in the end valiantly put backe, and there was ſlaine the yong Baron of Curton, Randan ſore hurte, and his Lieutenant D'Amanzay dead, the Cornet of Auannes ſore hurt, and his horſe

ſlaine vnder him, Forges Guidon of the company of Tauannes ſlaine, the Vicecount D'Auchy Guidon of the Duke of Guiſes ſore hurt, and ſundry valiant men out of all the companies,The ſecond combate in which the imperials were ouerthrowne. as the Sonne of Pied-pape, yong Iouy, Bourdilly, yong Branches, and many others; whoſe death, hurtes, and retreates gaue ſuch hart to the Imperialles ſo well to hope, as they already encouraged one another, as hauing gained an entire victory: whereupon the Duke of Guiſe and Tauannes, hauing aſſembled their troupes together againe, the which the D. D' Aumalle with all the light Cauallerie went to ioyne, began with one fronte ſo furiouſly to charge vpon the Imperials, as they opened, and threw downe the Piſtoliers of Vuluenfort ſo rudelye, as they themſelues brake the battaile of their Almanes to retire, who might beſt, whileſt that the Duke of Neuers who had his Regiment placed along the glade towards Ranty, paſſed betweene the battaile of the Almanes and the French, to charge in a heape vpon all the Spaniſh Harquebuzerie, which by fauour of their cauallerie was alreadye come out of the wood, which they perfourmed ſo couragiouſly, and with ſuch violence, as they were all ouerthrowne and put to flight; yea in ſuch diſorder as they ſuddenly turned their back, to eſcape and get into the wood, where there were taken and razed ſeuenteene Enſignes of footmen, fiue Cornets of horſe, and foure fielde peeces which they found cleane abandoned all along the glade. The Admirall then who was the firſt which alighted before the battaile of the French, cauſed a number of Souldiers to leaue their ranckes ſtill to follow the victory, who entring within the wood at the beginning made a great ſlaughter of their enemies, ridding all ſuch as they met of their miſerable liues, by the cruell edge of their ſworde. There were the Emperours Piſtols found and brought vnto the King, whileſt that the companies of men at armes purſued the victorie all along the glade and borders of the wood, eſpecially the light Cauallerie and Tauannes his company, which deſcended downe into the bottome of the valley, where was likewiſe defeated a great number of thoſe which were come downe out of the wood, hoping to gaine their Campe. The reſt of the troupes tarried vpon the top of the valley, vpon which they ſtraightwaies made the Emperours artillerie to playe, which remained on the other borde his ſide, whereby his people might ſomewhat the more fauourablye retreate. But to anſwere him, the French was as ſoon leuelled againſt the corner of the wood, which made his quickly recoyle backe, the battailes of the footmen which were already come together vpon this top in the plaine, ſtill attending what might further enſue. During this time the Emperor cauſed his Campe with all diligence to be razed, trenched and fortified: doubting of a more hotte purſute. But the night comming on, was an occaſion to the French to paſſe the reſt of the time in peace, and to content themſelues with the happy iſſue of this reencounter. Now for that the companies of the men at armes of the D. of Guiſe, Neuers, Bourdillon, and Tauannes, were the firſt which fought, and moſt hotly purſued their enemies, the King was ſo highly contented therwith, as he Knighted the cheefe Captaines and principall members thereof. Among the reſt Tauannes whome hee greatlye honoured, and gaue vnto him the order which he wore about his owne neck,Number of the dead French and Imperial. vſing towards the reſt great liberalitie, eſpecially towards thoſe as preſented vnto him either Enſignes, Cornets, or artillerie, which they had taken or found abandoned. After the encounter the French Captaines viewed ouer their bandes, to know thoſe which had beene ſlaine or hurt, where there were found of dead about two hundred or twelue ſcore: but the Emperour loſt there thriſe as manye men: for the charge and onſet of the French was at the firſt ſo furious, as without reſpect of any, nor tarrying about priſonners, all ſuch as preſented themſelues before them,

were hewen in peeces, ſo as the D. of Sauoy and Dom-Ferrant to ſaue thēſelues were faine to runne into the thick of the wood, where they remained ſo long, as it was a great time before any newes could be heard of Dom-Ferrant, ſo as hee was eſteemed either to be dead or taken priſonner. And there was alſo taken a Colonel of the Almanes, which a Harquebuſier found within the wood ſore hurt, who being kept by the Baron of Fontenay, dyed a few daies after in his handes. A Spaniſh Captaine named de Caſtres, who ſaide hee had beene page to the Admirall, being abandoned for dead, was taken by an other Harquebuſier, to whome they gaue ſo good entertainement, as within few daies after his wounds being broght into good plight, for a ſmall ranſome he was ſent away, and conueied vnto the Caſtle of Renty. There was likewiſe taken priſonner, a gentleman of great vertue and knowledge of the Emperours chamber, named De Silly, who afterward was employed to mediate a peace betweene theſe two Princes.
            After that the K. was retired with his battaile into his firſt ſtand, the Conſtable encamped the ſame night within the wood, with al the Vantgard, in the very place of victorie, but with ſmall reſt notwithſtanding; for that all the night the Imperials kept themſelues in battaile, the two armies remaining in great doubt one of the other, for the French preſumed how that the Emperour being a couragious &amp; magnanimous Prince, would neuer endure ſuch a loſſe, without doing of his beſt for reuenge: but he ſeeing himſelfe weak, and ſo vnfauoured of fortune, knowing the puiſſance of the K. feared leaſt he would turn all his forces to defeat him for altogether. So as hauing with all diligence poſſible, cauſed his Campe to be encloſed about round with great trenches, by peep of day we might ſee them in ſo great forwardnes, as they reſted as impregnable. The ſame day notwithſtanding to make an end of his part, the K. ſent the Conſtable to view whether there could be any acceſſe or means to go ſearch thē out within their owne fort, who gaue aduiſe of an impoſsibilitie, without danger of looſing thereby a great number of valiant men: ſo this day paſſed peaceably ouer on each ſide, ſtill continuing for all that the battery againſt the caſtle, vntill night that the Emperour cauſed all his artillery to be diſcharged in ſigne of great ioy, and reioycing for the good newes which he had receaued of the defeate of Peter Stroſsy, and a great number of the French partie in Italy. I will tell you elſe where how the matter was: vpon this the fifteenth day of the moneth, the retreat of the army into France was reſolued of in full councell, as well for want of prouiſions for horſes, as to change the ayre, which was already infected and corrupted with the ſtinche of carrins and dead horſes, whereof the plague is quickly engendred, and other diſeaſes very contagious in an army; alleadging in like ſorte that the K. would not loſe ſo many braue men as followed him, before ſo little a place, and of no worth; but for all that the K. meant firſt to aduertiſe the Emperor therof, and ſent him word that it was not for any doubt of him, and that if hee would aſſure him that he would meet him, he would tarry for him foure long houres on the way, as he did: for hauing cauſed the Cartes and baggage to be ſent away, the armye wholy remained in battaile more then three howres in the ſame place, where the Monday before they had fought. But none preſenting themſelues, and knowing how that the Imperialles were cloſe ſhutte vp in their Campe, hauing in their ſight ſet fire on all the Villages about, they began with a ſofte march to retire, looking back ſometimes to ſee if they were followed. And ſo late enough arriued at Montcaure, a league from Montereul, where they ſoiourned 5. daies together, ſtil to learn out &amp; vnderſtand the enterpriſes of th'emperor, the which as long as the French forces were ſtill aſſembled, the King might more eaſilye

preuent, and meete with them if they ſhould put into the fielde. But hauing certaine intelligence how the armie was not as yet departed from their firſt lodging in the plaines of Marque, and that the Emperour expreſſely tarried to ſee the reparations and amendements of Rente, the K. purpoſed in like ſort to giue ſome reſt and refreſhing to his owne; Notwithſtanding that before the fiue dayes were out, want of fourage and euill ayre of the marſhes cauſed them to diſlodge and come neerer to Montereul, where they ſoiourned fiue other dayes entire; the K. being lodged in the Charter houſe, and the Campe pitched all along the little riuer of Cauche, where the Engliſh and Scottiſh companies receiued an euill bobbe, in being ſcattered and lodged two leagues farther thē the Vantgarde, in a village called Marenlo, where the imperials hauing receaued aduertiſement thereof, and being guided by one of the ſame village, were to ſurpriſe them at midnight, ſo as their lodgings being ſet on fire, ſome of the maſters, ſeruants, and horſes tyed were burned, ſome ſlaine, and ſome caried away priſonners: wherupon the Emperour being retired to S. Omer, without hauing any meanes to be able to vndertake any matter of great importance or dammage to the French; as alſo that the Winter and euill weather threatned him, the K. departed thence with the D. of Guiſe, and certaine gentlemen of his houſe to goe to Compeugne, after he had well munitioned and fortefied the gariſons of the townes of Ardres, and Bolongne, to make head &amp; keep ſtrong againſt his enemy, if he would beſiege him: the Conſtable remaining cheefe of the ouerplus of the army, as well to keepe it vnited, as the better and more readily to be able to prouide for whatſoeuer the Emperour could vndertake: whoſe guiles the French haue alwaies feared, eſpecially vpon the end of a warre; wherupon they took occaſion to charge now &amp; then vpon his campe, as well thereby to know and learne ſome thing, as to keep ſcoute for the fouragers, who were faine to goe very far to recouer victuals and fourage for their horſes, who hauing no more left to nouriſh them withall, they were enforced againe to diſlodge and paſſe ouer the riuer on the other ſide, where the army was pitched &amp; encamped in the villages of Brameu, Eſpimeu, Beaurin, &amp; al alongſt the riuer ſhoare. They taried there certain daies,The K. army diſſolued. fearing leaſt the Emperour ſhould beſiege Montreul, Ardres, or Dourlan: notwithſtanding being aduertiſed how his Souldiers for want of pay, victuals, and other commodities, diſſolued themſelues: the conſtable not to conſume the reſt of the victuals of the frontire (which were alreadye greatly diminiſhed and growne deare) ſent home the rirebands to their houſes, and diſmiſſed the Zuizers well contented &amp; ſatisfied, as wel with their pay, as with the order of knighthood beſtowed by the K. vpon Mandoſſe their Generall, and vpon the Captains Theodore Inderhalden Colonel of the Cantons, and Petroman Clery Colonel of the townes, and Aonis who was afterwardes the K. Embaſſadour to the Grizons, a few daies after being accompanied with the Marſhal S. Andre, he came vnto the K. who gaue the cō
               duct of the reſt of the army to the D. of Vendoſme: wherupon the emperor who had alwaies delaied and diſſembled his determination, ſeeing his forces diminiſhed ſuddenly, called backe certaine companies which before hee had cauſed to departe the campe, to drawe towards Hedin. The which the D. of Vendoſme foreſeeing, &amp; that he meant to be reuenged in burning the flat country, as the French had done his, cauſed his camp to diſlodge, ſtil to accoſt him and hold him in ſuch awe, as he ſhuld not ſcatter his army, ſo as hauing paſſed the riuer of Authie, hee encamped that night at Dampierre, vntill the next morrow about noone, when as hee was aduertiſed how the moſt part of the Imperial army and cauallery was come down to Auchy, a Caſtle appertaining to the Count of Aiguemont, and had fired the ſame, broken &amp; defeated

certaine companies of light cauallery, which the Duke doubting of their cōming to hinder the paſſage of the riuer had ſent thither. The which cauſed him ſodenlye to raiſe his Campe from Dampierre, and imagining by the courſe which his enemye tooke, that he meant to beſiege Abbeuille or Dorlan, hee approched neerer to theſe two places, the which he furniſhed and fortefied with what euer was neceſſarye. Afterwards on the morrow being the firſt of September, he paſſed the riuer of Somme, and pitched his Campe at Pondormy, a place very commodious both to keepe the Country and paſſage of the riuer: the ſame day the Imperials began to make waſte, and to burne the flat Country which the French had abandoned, for two or three leagues compaſſe, encamping at Saint Requier, two leagues from the French, whom they thought ſhould not diſlodge thence without battaile offred, or ſome charges or other braueries perfourmed: an occaſion that the next morning early the D. of Vendoſme ſent his light cauallerie with three hundred men at armes to ſupporte them, vnder the conduct of the Prince of Anguian, who approched as neere their Campe as he was able, and kept them ſo as they ſhould not ſcatter to burne and deſtroye the villages, holding them in ſuch awe and ſubiection, that they alwaies marched in troupes cloſe together: at night the French ouerthrew at their taile certain waggons laden with victualles, which were nothing but apples, bonillons, and very naughtye bread: the which cauſed them to think that in ſo great want and neceſsitie of victuals they would not long keepe themſelues encamped: notwithſtanding they marched afterwards all along the riuer of Authie, and ſet fire on the Caſtles and Villages alongſt as they paſſed. As at Dampierre, Daurye, Marchy, Marchye, Mainthenay, and diuers other places: an occaſion that the Duke of Vendoſme ſent ſixe ſcore men at armes as well of his company as of the Marſhall S. Andres, with 9. Enſignes of foote to lodge in the Towne of Montereul, which the Imperialles made countenance as though they meant to beſiege: whereof being aduertiſed, and changing their purpoſe, they returned back to paſſe the Riuer of Authye, and deſcended into the Marſhes belowe Hedin, betweene the riuer and an other which commeth out of the County of S. Poul, in a place called Meſnil, fit to be fortefied for the keeping and aſſurance of the baliadge of Hedin, and county of S. Pol. Then on the twelfth of September they began to reare and build vp a forte, hauing for the more ſpeedy diſpatch of the defence, leauied a great number of Pionners and labourers out of the Countryes about, which they did without any let, for beſides that they were within their landes, the French army was maruelouſly diminiſhed and leſſened euery day, both by reaſon of ſickneſſe among the Souldiers, as of the companies which were ſent vnto the townes, which were threatned with a ſiege at hand. This done, the D. of Vendoſme knowing his Souldiers to be very wearye with the long trauaile of this voyage, to refreſh and ſolace them, brake vp his Campe; and ſent certaine companies of men at armes of the moſt tired, to winter in their ancient Garriſons, and his light cauallerie in places neereſt to the enemy, and to helpe and ſuccour the poore people, to husband and ſowe their fieldes The foote companies of French, Engliſh, and Scottiſh, were lodged in the Townes and Borroghes all alongſt the the banke of the Riuer of Some. The Almanes of the County of Reingraue, and Baron of Frontenay, at S. Eſprit de Reux; which they cauſed to be fortefied for a counterforte to Meſmil, and thoſe of the Count Rocdolphe, and Reifberge, tooke their way towardes Piemont and Italy.

            THE THIRD BOOKE.
            
               YOu haue already ſeene how the French and the Imperialles ſought out one another with as great ſtomacke as euer: eche of them the more forward, thorough the preſence of their Princes, which as then conducted the armies, when as Henry with great fury battered the caſtle of Renty, and had carried it, had not the Emperour broght thither all his forces, the better to encourage them which were beſieged, and allaye the fury of the French, by the skirmiſhes and hotte ſallies which he cauſed to be vndertaken by the cheefeſt of his army; ſo as the Erench albeit they carried away the honour of the memorable reencounter which I haue mencioned, (in which the Spaniſh Fanterie put to rout, the Almane Piſtoliers of Count Vul-uenſort, ſince called Reiſters, were broken and put to flight by the French Cauallerie) were yet in the end conſtrained to quit the place, retyring themſelues in march, as if they ſhould haue preſented battaile to the Imperials, from which the Emperour kept them thorough the fauour of his trenches. Afterwards the two Princes hauing for the reaſons which I alleadged elſewhere, broken &amp; diſſolued their armies, wherof they placed a good part in the garriſons of their frontiers, the better to be able continually to vndertake an enterpriſe more ſecretly, &amp; as opportunity ſerued, helde themſelues a long time vpon their garde, without much diſcouering themſelues, through the diſcommodities of the Autumne, and violence of the bluſtring Winter: employing themſelues onely in ſome ſurpriſes and ſecret intelligences, whereof verye fewe ſucceded ſo well as the vndertakers deſired. Theſe two Princes in the meane ſpace pricked forward, no leſſe with enuye, then a reciprocall ambition, boyling with a worldlye deſire of reuenge, by the remembrance of ſo great loſſes, old &amp; new offences, made ready al kinde of preparatiues for a war at hād, and much more bloudye then the former; ſo as the brute being ſpread throughout France of the rodes which the Imperial garriſons ſtil made, the French therby ſoone tooke occaſion to march vnder the Marſhall of S. Andre, for to ſurpriſe, ſcale, at breake of daye, and cutte into peeces, whomſoeuer they ſhould finde in armes, in the Caſtle of Cambreſy. At what time the Spaniards had notwithſtanding the fauour

of a faire warre, to retire themſelues whether it liked them beſt.Mariembourg. About the beginning of the ſame ſpring Bouillon as the K. lieutenant in the abſence of the D. of Neuers Gouernour of Champaigne, was ſent thither to reſcue thoſe of Mariembourg: afterwards to enterpriſe vpon the enemy as occaſion ſhould be offred, for the Imperialles meant no leſſe to the place then to the Garriſon, becauſe that this Towne (hauing before beene a Village and pleaſant ſeate of Mary widdowe to Lewis King of Hungarie, which ſhe had cauſed to be moſt curiouſly builded and fortefied, whileſt that ſhe was gouerneſſe of the Countrye for the Emperour her Brother) was builded and raiſed vp much ſtronger, and farre better prouided then before: yea the K. would needs beſtowe his owne name thereof, as this Princeſſe before had done hers: which notwithſtanding more happye in that,Pope Iuly 3. deceaſed. could not out of the memorye of the people bordering round about.
            The three and twentith of March Pope Iulye the third of that name deceaſed, after hauing taken great paines in the latter end of his yeares, to reconcyle theſe two great Lordes, whome himſelfe before had ſet to debate: an occaſion that the ninth day of Aprill the Cardinall Marcel Ceruin of Montpulcien in Tuſcane, was choſen and proclaimed Pope, who by no meanes would change his name as the reſt were wonte to doe. He was Biſhop of Nicaſtre,Pope Marcel poyſoned. and Cardinal of the tittle of Holye croſſe in Hieruſalem, who died poyſoned for all that, as ſome affirme, the two and twentith day of his election, for that he was of too good a life. But in very truth as hee was before giuen to be ſicke of the yellowe Iaunders, the diſeaſe grewe ſo ſore vpon him in his olde yeares, as hee dyed the three and twentith day of his Papacye. True it is that a fewe dayes before his death he made himſelfe be crowned with very ſmall expences, and very modeſtly. Now as he was very wiſe, ſo men had a great hope that he would correct many thinges in the Romiſh Church, and eſpecially that he would chaſe away all the diſſolution and ſuperfluitie thereof, from whence the brute of his poyſoning did growe: for indeede hee aboliſhed the ſuperfluities of gardes, and other honours which the firſt Biſhops of Rome knew not once what they meant.Pope Paul 4. Afterwards the three and twentith of May the Cardinals thoſe in their conclaue, the Cardinall Iohn Pierre Caraffa, Deane of the Colledge called Theatin Neapolitain,Ieſuiſtes. named Paul the fourth, eſteemed to be a man very eloquent and learned. The firſt author (being a Monke at Veniſe) of Ieſuiſtes, of whome I will ſpeake elſe where. For at diuers times, and throughout all the Prouinces of Chriſtendome, yea as farre as the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, they haue engrauen and thundred out the name of their profeſſion, thorough the merite of their paines, incredible hazardes and cruelties, which they haue ſuffered among the Barbarians, for the name of Chriſt.
            In this time Philip of Auſtria, by Mary King of England, as well to appeaſe the mutinyes which were growne betweene the Engliſh malcontentes thorough the alliance with a Stranger, and other greeued with the change of the Proteſtant Religion for the Romane, as the better to entertaine traffique and other commodityes with the French, one parte of the great riches of that inſularie kingdome, curious on the other ſide of the generall good and repoſe of Chriſtendome, refuſed not with Charles the Emperour his Father, and Henry the ſecond, to hearken to a vniuerſall peace, eſpecially at the perſwaſions of the Engliſh Cardinall Poole, who hauing paſſed betweene the Emperous and the King of France, did maruelouſlye ſollicite them to a good accorde: whereunto the rather to induce them, he inſiſted both by woordes and wrighting. Among other meanes and perſwaſions, wherewith hee ſerued himſelfe to bring them to this poynt, he vſed theſe.
            
               
               
                  Whileſt that you make ciuill warre one vpon another, the Turke ſtretcheth out at large his dominion,
                  Cardinal Pole his perſwaſions to a peace. 
                  and hath already taken two fortes by land and Sea, to wit Belgrade and Rhodes, by meanes whereof hee hath made his way as farre as Bude, and is growne maiſter of the Danube; that if God had not raiſed him vp the K. of Perſia for an enemie, it is very likely that long ſince he had put all Chriſtendome vnder his obedience. By this occaſion many falſe Chriſtians are ſo multiplyed in diuers places, with ſuch corruption of all kinde of diſcipline, as well eccleſiaſticall as ciuill, as your power is not great enough to puniſh and correct them, which the mutinies growne in ſo many places well declare, the offices of religion left, the ſchiſmes and hereſies which in the meane time engender and grow throughout all Countries; you ought to conſider your own dutie, and aboue all that you be Princes of chriſtian religion. And albeit that God hath permitted Satan; (the author of all miſcheefe, who goeth about to ſifte the Church like Corne) to moue warre among you who are the two moſt principall and nobleſt members of the Church, yet hath hee not permitted his malice to exceede prophane and ciuill actions: for hee hath counter garded you entirely in one religion, in one ſame faith and opinion, aſſembled and vnited in one ſelfe ſame body of the Church: otherwiſe it were not poſsible to finde meanes to ſet you at accorde. And albeit that many other Princes are reuolted from the Church, and that the enemye of mankinde hath ſpread his malice throughout, God notwithſtanding hath looked vpon you in pittie, and brought to nought the attemptes of the Deuill. In which as for a certain ſigne of his bounty and clemency towards you, he ſheweth that finally he wil be ſerued by you, and vnite you with one fraternall bond, together with his Vicar on earth, to take away theſe ſo perillous diſcordes, and reſtore againe peace, as well in the ciuill as eccleſiaſticall estate.
               
            
            
               Pole alleadged many other thinges to this purpoſe, greatly threatning them with the wrath and vengeance of God, if they did not leaue of theſe their paſsions, and take compaſsion of the poore people ſo greatly afflicted. And albeit that he preuailed nothing, yet for ſo much as the affaires of England came to his wiſh, hee inſiſted in ſuch ſorte, as hee cauſed the Emperour and the King of France to come to this poynte, to ſende Embaſſadours on the one parte and the other. The Queene of England who carried her ſelfe neuter in this cauſe, cauſed a place to bee choſen neate and proper in the fielde, betweene Cales, Ardes, and Graueline, Townes vnder the ſubiection of England, France, and Burgondie, ſcituate as in a tryangle, then hauing made caſt a trenche round, ſhe cauſed foure lodginges to be reared vp for the time onely, but commodious enough; where the three and twentith daye of May the Embaſſadours aſſembled. On the Emperours parte the Biſhop of Arras, among other for the French King were the Cardinall of Lorraine, and the Conſtable; for England to mediate the Peace, was Pole, the Earle of Arundel, and Paget. The brute hereof being ſpread abroade, gaue men occaſion to think and hope for much, eſpeciallye thoſe who vnderſtoode not the deapth of the differences: for there was queſtion made of the Duchies of Milan, Bourgondie, Sauoye, Piemont,The place appointed to treat of the Peace. Corſe, Nauarre, Lorraine, Luxēbourg, of the Townes of Thou, Verdun and Metz: matters hauing beene long and ſtiffelye debated, as among other difficulties, the Engliſh mediators were of opinion that the knowledge of certaine of the differents, were fitte to be reſerued to the deciding of a Councell, they all departed thence without doing ought. The tenth of Iune Ferdinande and the eſtates of the Empire; beſought the Emperour by their letters, that in treating of peace, he would haue eſpeciall regarde to what the K. of France had taken away from the Empire. Now nothing being accorded betweene the Embaſſadours, the Emperour wrote backe fifteene dayes after to the eſtates in like ſubſtance.
            
               
                  
                  The Emperours letters to the ſtates.
                  I Greatly reioyced to ſee that you tooke pittie of thoſe whom the enemie to my ſelfe and the Empire hath ſacked. I alwaies had eſpecial care that they ſhold be reſtored into their former eſtate, and before I receiued your letters, I gaue expreſſe charge to my Embaſſadours, and principall Councellors deputed for a peace, that they ſhould in any wiſe preſſe this, without yeelding one inche. And albeit that in all the treaties of peace which I haue made, I thought in reſpect of the publike tranquilitie they would not bee to obſtinate, yet they are departed away without doing ought, and notwithſtanding I doe not refuſe a peace for the good of Christendome, ſo as they make me any reaſonable offers, and as opportunitie ſhall be offred. I will ſtraine myſelfe to get ſuch goods as haue beene pluckt from the Empire reſtored into their former eſtate.
                  
               
            
            See how God which hath the harts of Kings in his hands, making each partie to iudge the others demaunds to vnreaſonable, would not permit Chriſtendome ſo ſoone to enioy a benefit ſo much deſired. In ſort that each one keeping himſelfe vpon feare of a ſurpriſal, eaſily made his neighbor thinke, how the cariadges of the Garriſons round about tended to more high enterpriſes. So as theſe two Princes tickled with the like feare, and quickly taking one anothers actions for a ſufficient defiance of warre, as Henrie deuided his men where he ſaw it moſt needfull, the Emperour firſt put his armie into the field of twentie thouſand fighting men vnder Martin Rouſſan baſtard of Cleues, who after many roades, burnings, and vncredible waſts all along the Meuſe, encamped at Deux Giuets, minding to build a fort vpon that mountaine, at the foot whereof this riuer runneth, there by to bridle all the quarters round about, &amp; make a ſure retreate there for al ſuch as were able to endomage the French. The D. of Neuers in the meane ſpace hauing taken good order for Maizieres, and other places of importance, reſolued by the K. commaundement to victuall well Mariemburg. And to that end hauing ſpeedily and ſecretly made ready all preparations as well of men as victuals, munitions, and companies vnder the Comte of Retheloix, he ſent three hundred harquebuſiers as well French as Engliſh and Scots, mounted to diſcouer and bring backe word to the cheefe of the eight hundred light horſe, which followed them, what they ſhould diſcry: who with the leader of the vantgard of two hundred men at armes, and eight enſignes of fantaſſins which marched after, and a number of harquebuſiers cloſe to the winges of the wagons, prouided therto whatſoeuer was needfull according to the generals commaundment, who led the battell of three hundred men at armes, and eight enſignes of fantaſsins, hauing on his backe the arrieregard of two hundred men at armes, then one hundred Archers to haſten them, and to aduertiſe the chefe of euery occurrence. In ſuch ſort as this order being thus followed, ioyned thereto the ſpeedines of the march, and well diſciplined obedience of the ſouldiers, was the cauſe that fiue hundred wagons as well of the K. munition as voluntarie Marchants entred in without any diſturbance, which either the enemie or badnes of the way could yeeld vnto them, fully perſwading themſelues throughout all the marche, which was eight long leagues, that they were able enough to make hed to the enemie, when, where, and with what troupes ſoeuer hee would aduance, though he were dubble as ſtrong as the French. Afterwards the D. hauing placed there, and encouraged Du Fumel gouernour, &amp; left fiftie men at armes, two hundred light horſe, and nine olde companies of the beſt ſouldiers on foote, departed thence, and making his vantgard of the hindermoſt, kept on another way to viſit Rocroy, where the Capitane La Lande was. So the Garriſons of Gampaigne,

frontires of Haynaut, and countries about being well prouided, the imperiall armie was as ſoone diſlodged thorough the infection and diſcommoditie of victuals which they there endured. So as Martin Rouſſan being dead and many other, the better ſorte were ſent to Giuets. Whether the D. of Neuers marched with his troupes: againſt whome the imperials skirmiſhing, and ſetting on them with many ſalies, maintained and doubled by their reciprocall ſuccours, had ſoone enough recorded a memorable reencounter, conſidering the aduantage and euident fauour ſtill turning on the French partie, had not Henrie expreſly forbidden his Leiutenant to fight, but in great, and in the field without aſſailing them in their fort. So as being retired and diſperſed into Garriſons, the reſt of the time paſſed ouer mildly vntill the midſt of Auguſt, whē the Emperour hauing ſent the Prince of Orange with new forces to reaſſemble his troupes, ſet forth an armie vnder the generall of the houſe of Challons: the effectes whereof notwithſtanding was but to keepe in the French, and rayſe vp the forte A Couins neere Mariembourg, which was after called Philippe Ville. Beſides the Amirall Gaſpard of Coligny gouernour of Picardie, tooke ſuch order within his frontires as he left nothing at randome. Anthoine of Vendoſme, had ſurrendred that gouerment into the K. hands, at ſuch time as being married to Ioane of Albert, ſoale heire to Henrie of Albert, he went to take poſſeſsion of the kingdome of Nauarre, Dutchy of Albert, Earledome of Foix, Armignac, Bigorre, and Soueraintie of Bearn, after the deceaſe of his Father in law. Since notwithſtanding as ſome of the Garriſons of Picardie mingled with 15. hundred horſe of the Rerebandes, whome they tearme the companies of the nobles, and fower hundred pioners had ſo happily ouerrunne the countrie round about vnder La Iaille their generall, as they all returned laden with a rich nauy ineſtimable bootie, Hauſimont gouernour of Bapaume, finding them betweene a woode a village and a riuer, (the paſſages whereof he cauſed to bee broken downe and kept) without skouts, without order, without any feare of the enemie, and without hart, charged them ſo roundly with a few men, as in leſſe then nought, he made them leaue together with their courage al their rich pickkerie, yea and their verie liues at his deuotion. The wood and the riuer notwithſtanding ſaued a great number, La Iaille hurt, and more then a third part priſoners the reſt died in the place. The which the imperials tooke ſo greatly to their aduantage, as they could not ſpeak of any other more notable exploite, ſo farre as it grew to a ſcoffe among them, how they had taken the nobles of France without weighing thē. Albeit that theſe troupes were not indeede furniſhed for the moſt part but of Ronturiers, vnnoble euery kind of way, or of ſome ſeruants which the olde or ſicke Lordes, widowes and orphelins had ſent thither: the gentlemen hauing beene all retyred to the ordinances of the K. who ought in reſpect of his owne honour, and profit of his ſubiects to reforme ſuch and like lewd abuſes, as are committed in the companies of bands and rerebands. In ſumme the enemies encouraged with ſuch a ſucceſſe, tooke heart of grace to venter further vpō Picardie: for the defence wherof the D. of Guiſe retired into the town of his owne name, the Admirall into his gouerment, &amp; the K. himſelfe aduanced as far as Villiers Cottorets, the better to aſſure and diſpoſe his forces where hee ſhould ſee neede: yet they kept much at this ſtay, and within a little after the forces of the imperials diſſolued without performing any great matter.
            
               The ſtate of Piemont.
               IN this time notwithſtanding whilſt they repoſed themſelues vnder a good guard, the French and imperials awakened but too often for the worſt in Piemont, vnder

the Marſhall de Briſſac, and D. of Alua Leiutenants for their Soueranes: for the Marſhall hauing opened the paſſages of La Vaudote and of the Alpes, thereby to giue a more eaſie entrie to all occurrences, as alſo in Lombardie and Italy, by the ſurpriſall which he had made the winter before of Yuree, and the voluntarie yeelding of Bielle, withall appurtinances vnto it reſolued at the ſpring to ſtretch out further the bonds of his gouernment. Firſt he fortefied Santia which ſome call Saint Iaco, a place cleane razed downe, whereunto hauing giuen a ſquare forme, and a great bulwarke on euery flanke, defended with two high platformes, diſcouering the whole circuite a Culuerins length, and furniſhing it beſides, with whatſoeuer the art of that time was able to yeeld, he made it very ſufficient to commaund the whole plaine without any ſubiection: cloſing vp the paſſage of Verceil, Creſentin, and all Lombardie,Captaine Saluoſon. ſo far as he brideled the commings forth and ſuccours of Vulpian, which he determined to famiſh, if he were not able to enforce it at the ſecond ſiege which he purpoſed to lay there. Afterwards he ſeaſed vpon Crepacuore, the better to open his way, and keepe the paſſage free, attending the execution of the enterpriſe which Saluoiſon one of his Captaines was to make vpon Caſal, a place of the greateſt importance &amp; beſt defended of all that quarter. This chefetaine hauing reaſonably well profited in learning, in which he was nouriſhed and brought vp by his parents, that by the deſart thereof he might come to greater preferment, retired himſelfe from the Vniuerſities for occaſions ſleight enough. Whereby giuing himſelfe to carrie the ſword, and to make profeſsion of armes, hee coulde not long endure to liue in France without ſeeing of Piemont: where the exerciſe of armes pleaſed him in ſuch ſort, as being firſt enroled in the muſter Booke, then thorough his owne merite honoured with the degree of Corporall, which got him the halbard, afterwards an enſigne of a companie of fanterie, in the end was as well thought of by his Maſter of the campe, as mounting by all the degrees of warre he grew maruelous well knowne and recommended of euerye man. Rich notwithſtanding in honours and friendſhip more then wealth, or other recompences, (which ſuch as carrie not a gentle hart prefer before all gentilitie) ſo farre as he was made gouernour of Verrue: where he wrought and addreſſed an enterpriſe which I will declare vnto you, for an inſtruction to ſuch as will giue them to follow the like traine of armes. Hauing got good intelligence of the towne of the people and munition which was there, by meanes of one Fantarolle, a Marchant of Pont de ſture who did ordinarily trafique thither: and hauing made ready all his preparatiues to ſcale it by night, whilſt a mariage of one of the moſt notable inhabitants was ſolemniſed, where Figuerol gouernour of the place, which the chiefeſt of the garriſon and countrie was aſſembled, the Phiſitians which hee ſent to fetch from Caſal vnder the colour of a counterfaite ſickenes, to take away all ſuſpition which might ariſe, being no ſooner come, but he with Birague, Vimerocat, and a number of ſouldiers, which found the guards, ſentinels and other the inhabitants almoſt all a ſleepe, made himſelf maſter of the towne, after a little ſheding of their blood which offred to reſiſt him, ſeaſing on the market place, gates, carfoxes, and other places of importance, thorough the helpe of a number of ſouldiers, which he before had cauſed to come in, clad in countrie folkes apparell, as if they had ment to ſell their fruites to the inhabitants. The compt of Ladron notwithſtanding; cheefe of the Almanes, which hee quickly got together: kept the place a long time againſt Saluoiſon and the Marſhall himſelfe, whoſe forces ſuppreſt him ſoone enough, whilſt that Figuerol, and a number of Spanniards, amaſed at the crie of France, got haue clad into the Citadel, which the Marſhall of Briſſac ready with the Cannon battered, and carried away in fower

and twentie howers, with condition of life ſaued to thoſe that held it, who went away, without carrying any of the munition, whether it beſt liked them. Thus the tenth day of March, one thouſand fiue hundred fiftie and fiue, the ſtore of prouiſions which was prepared for the recouerie of Piemont, was taken, and Saluoiſon eſtabliſhed gouernour of the place, whence the aſſurance of the greter part of the Marquiſat of Montferrat depended, which was already in the K. hands, as being the Key of all that prouince, and gappe of al Lombardie: afterwards with the ſame foote he ſeaſed of all the forts about, and puſhing forward towards Alexandria, battered, tooke, and ruined Poman, Saint Saluadour, and other little places not able to hold out, and vnpoſſible to be fortefied ſo ſoone as he deſired, the better to open to himſelfe the way to Milan. Ioynt that he found it more expedient to remit his forces, &amp; increaſe his army, which he purpoſed to put into the field, then to deuide thē into Bicoques in danger to looſe them all vpon the comming of ſo great an armie as the D. of Alua prepared againſt him.
               In Aprill 1555. there grew a notable change in Italy about the free eſtate of Syene, touching the principalitie thereof. To the which Coſme of Medices newly created Archduke of Tuſcane had aſpired of a long time: as well for that this common wealth being of ſo great force and ſcope was encloſed within his lands of Tuſcane, as to render the effects of his power conformable to the title which had beene giuen vnto him. In reſpect that the accidents therein grew verie diuers and were ſtrangely handled, me thinketh it very reaſonable that the courſ therof be reſearched euen from the firſt originall. The Emperour being ſeaſed of Siene in Tuſcane, had placed there for gouernour Don Diego de Mondoze with a Spanniſh garriſon: againſt whome, hauing begun a Citadell vnder colour of doing it for the townes defence, but carrying himſelfe to ſeuere towards the inhabitants they al conſpired to ſet them ſelues at libertie: foreſeeing that the Emperour would bring in the forces of the Florentine their enemie againſt them, and that the Citadell was builded on the way to Florence. Mendoze in the meane time vnder colour of defending the people againſt the inſolencies of the Nobles, cauſed them to lay a ſide their armies, but exerciſing his rigor afterwardes on both parties: who being accorded and forgetting their olde quarels, let the French to vnderſtand how rudely they were handled, aduertiſing them of the ſtrange deſſeins of the Spanniards throughout all Italy. Againſt whome they beſought ſuccour, beſeeching to be receiued vnder their protection, eſpecially conſidering that this Principalitie would bee a verie fit thing for the K. the better to bridle the Imperials in Italy. Concluding that Kings being eſtabliſhed to ſuccour the afflicted, and that Siene hauing beene at al times affectionate vnto the French, deſerued not to be refuſed in ſo iuſt a requeſt which brought vnto him nothing but honour and profit, with a maruelous comfort to all Italy. In the ende the ſuccours which they demaunded were promiſed. And albeit that Coſme had aduertiſed Mendoze, of all the proceeding hereof: yet he nothing fearing the Sienois being bridled in and vnarmed, ſet verie light by the aduertiſment. So as the conſpirators, and other fugitiues thoroughout all Italy leuied in the K. name ſixe thouſand men vnder the conduct of Nicolas Earle of Petiglian,The Turks ſcoured the coaſt of Tuſcane. of Hieronime Piſan, and Marie de Saint Flour with a number of Cauallerie. Now as it fell out that in this time Dragut Rais a famous Corſaire, and cheefe of the Turkes armie by ſea ſcowred all along the coaſt of Italy, the K. enemies tooke occaſion thereby to make the bruite to runne, how that he was come thither to put certaine ports of Tuſcane into the French mens ha
                     •
                  des, which came by ſea in Gallies from Marſeiles to the ſuccours of the Sienois. So as the

Spanniards began to arme themſelues, fortefie places, and to demaund ſuccour of the Duke, who ſent eight hundred ſoldiers of proofe to Mendoze, ſeaſing themſelues of the places and paſſage of Siene, whereat the inhabitants were ſo ſtirred vp, as within a few daies after, they cauſed the Earle of Petiglian ſecretly to enter in, with fortie thouſand men, who droue the Spanniards out of Siene, with a great ſlaughter notwithſtanding both of the one part &amp; the other. The reſt of the Spanniards got them into the Citadell, and into the cōuent of preaching Friers, which they had fortefied. But afterwards with the eight peeces of artillerie, which was taken from them, they droue them out of the fortes, the Earle of Saint Flour ariuing there, with two thouſand ſouldiers which reſted of the leauie. In ſuch ſort as they tooke the conuent, and afterwards the Citadell, the moſt part of the chefetaines with the Florentine Capitanes retyring themſelues, and ſo all together by an accord made with the Cittizens, they departed out of Siene, and ſeaſed of Orbitelle a place ſeated in a Marſh, but euery way fit to annoy the Sienois. Hereupon the Emperour beeing conſtrained to quitte Metz, and retired into Germanie, where he vnderſtoode of the ſucceſſe of his affaires in Italy, commanded the viceroy of Naples Dom Garzie de Toledo, that aſſembling together all the forces which he poſſibly could, he ſhould blocke in the Sienois as much as in him lay. Which he accordingly did in Ianuary 1548. with twelue thouſand footmen and fifteene hundred horſe, as well Almanes as Neapolitanes. In the meane time the K. had ſent the Cardinall of Ferrare to Siene, and De Termes with two thouſand pioners, aſsiſted with the D. of Some, Earle of Saint Flour and other of the Vrſins, fortefying the places as they ſhould ſee neede. Corneille Bentinuogle entred into Roſie with fifteene hundred ſouldiers. Iohn de Thurin with three hundred men had the charge of Mont-alcin; Malian was giuen to Chiarmont, and La Turrite was gouernour thorough Galeas de Saint Seuerin with three hundred men. Ciuſi to Paul and Iordan Vrſins with two thouſand men vnder Aſinolonga. At Monticelle were Cipierre, Guy de Bentiuogle, and the Earle of Petiglian with fiue hundred light horſe, at Port Telamon was the Earle of Mirendolle, and a Satean, Ioachin a Gaſcoine Captaine accompanied with two hundred men. So as all de Termes his forces deuided thoroughout all the garriſons amounted to twelue thouſand footemen beſides the Cittizens in great number all enemies to the Spanniards and Florentines. But there was not aboue fiue hundred horſe: euerie man trauailing to fortefie and prouide for their places, De Termes and other euen to the verie women tooke maruelous paines to aſſure La Capitalle, whilſt that the viceroye ouerranne the countrie, and attempted the townes, which hee thought to carrie by open force, ſurpriſe, or intelligence. Conducting the armie with Aſcanio de La Corne, hee tooke ſome, and was forced to diſcampe before other, as at Moultacin, which was ſuccoured with the men which Bellegard nephew to De Termes cauſed to enter in. The intelligence which he had in Siene was diſcouered, and albeit the Cardinall cōmitted him vnto priſon which carried the newes, yet he ſet him againe at libertie, wherupon this Prelate was euer ſince ſuſpected of treaſon.
               In this time did Charles D. of Sauoye, driuen out of his countrie by the Kinge of France, leauing for heire of all his rights his onely Sonne Philibert Emmanuel:
                  D. of Sauove. to whome for recompence of many ſeruices the Emperour gaue the Earledome of Aſt to enioy it vntill he ſhould be able to recouer his owne inheritance. Charles was buried at Verceil almoſt in magnificence Royall. In the meane ſpace the Marſhall Briſſac Leiutennant generall for the K. in Piemont, hauing taken Yuree and Verceill without the Caſtle, and pilled the treaſures of the Sauoyon within the Church of

Saint Euſtace, aſtonied many men in Lombardie. But approching neere Milan, Fernand Gonzaque came verie fitly with forces for the Emperour. An occaſion that Briſſac retired backe to Yuree, and quitted Verceil which he was not able to keepe without the Citadell.
               The Imperials then not able to maſter Siene retired by little and little: ſo as De Termes had leaſure enough to paſſe into Corſe,Iſle of Corſe. and there to take the Towne of Saint Florent and Boniface, a porte of the Sea, in times paſt the porte of Siracuſe, from the Genowaies which gouerned there in parte. From whence retiring into France, being called backe by his Prince, he left behinde him a good Garriſon, and Iordan Vrſin his Maieſties Lieutenant to commaund there, with a number of French Captaines. The King in the meane time to be reuenged of the Duke of Florence, who held the Emperours cauſe againſt him and the Sienois, De Termes being called home, ſent Pierre Stroſsy for his Lieutenant General into Tuſcane, with a number of men at armes, charged to draw vnto him his Brother the Prior of Capoue, who was retired from the ſeruice of the French, the which he did, and went with him to La Mirandelle to raiſe there an army. Being arriued at Siene, and communicating his charge with the Cardinall of Ferrara, he thought it not beſt that he ſhould declare himſelfe ſo ſoone for many reaſons: eſpecially for that he had no iuſt occaſion to warre againſt the Florentine, except it were founded vpon the ancient and immortal hatred betweene the Strozzis and Medices, Strozzy notwithſtanding leuied at Rome, Vrbin, and other places, where men make market of their life, as many men as hee was able: whereof the Florentine aduertiſed Pope Iuly, exhorting him to driue the French out of Tuſcane, and ſuppreſſe the glory of the Sienois, promiſing him that that done, he would giue his daughter in mariage to the nephew of his holynes, and giue her a better portion then all the reſt of his children, ſauing the Prince: ſetting downe in like hand vnto the Emperour the danger of his eſtates in Italy, if the King ſhould make himſelfe more great in Tuſcane, and the meanes which might growe vnto him both in Lombardy and the kingdome of Naples: in ſuch ſort as the Pope and the Emperor ioyning themſelues with him, gaue charge to Iacques Le Medecin, Marqueſſe of Marignan, a valiant and wiſe Cheefe to leauie an army to this effect: who gathering together all his forces, and aſſuring himſelfe in his eſpials and diligences, more then any other meanes, did ſo much as the Sienois fearing nothing, and forgetting the charge which their Gouernour had giuen vnto them, to finiſhe the fortifications of theyr Towne: Rodolphe Baglion Peruſin generall of the light cauallerie comming about the beginning of Ianuary 1554. by night to Siene, with ſuch diligence, and ſo ſecret was without the care of Laurens de Chaſtillon, who made the round vpon the walles, the Towne had become imperiall: yea the Florentines themſelues confeſſed that after the aſſault well defended,Syene deſieged by the Marques of Marignan. if the Sienois had but ſalied out vpon them, tyred with ſo long trauaile and ſleepe, they had bene all defeated. But the Cardinall fearing leaſt they might haue ſome intelligence within the towne, contented himſelfe with thoſe which were ſlaine on the diches and rampire: the Maqueſſe notwithſtanding encamping before the Towne, waſted the whole Country; afterwards he battered the towne ſo furiouſly, as he had put them in great neceſsity, had not Strozzy who already had well furniſhed the ſtrong places of the Country, by his entry into the Town, encouraged the harts of the beſieged, and diminiſhed as much the hope of the enemies. Of whome hauing vnderſtoode how Baglion and Aſcane de la Corne had enterpriſed vpon Chiuſi one of the twelue ancient Citties of Hetruria, he went to charge them with ſixe hundred Souldiers ſo hottely, as Baglion remaining there dead, and de

La Corne priſonner, (afterwardes ſent captiue into Fraunce) the affaires of the Emperour beganne to growe in euill caſe. Ioynte that the Kinge to make himſelfe the ſtronger in Italy, ſent ouer and aboue the ſupplye of fiue thouſand ſouldiers Zuizers and Gaſcons, with ſome light Cauallerie promiſing beſides to ſend vnto him ſuccours by Sea, which entred into Siene without the enemies being witting thereof at all. The which emboldned Stroſsi to come foorth with ſixe thouſand footmen, and fiue hundred choſen horſe, manie Sienois following him, whoſe going foorth was no leſſe concealed from the Imperials then their entrance in. Afterwardes hauing giuen Moriane, (a place appertaining to the Luguois) for rendeuons vnto his armie which was to come out of Lombardie, he ouerranne diuers places of the Flourentines. He tooke Montalcin and Montcarles, which he fortefied to the great aſtoniſhment of the Duke of Flourence, who fearing to looſe his owne while hee ſought for an others, cauſed the Marqueſſe to retire from the ſiege, to defend the Countrie of Flourence, becauſe that Stroſsi his forces were ioyned vnto him. Then the Marqueſſe finding him ſelfe not to bee ſtrong enough, put himſelfe within Peſcia, there to attende the ſuccours which Camille Colone, and Iohn de Lunes were to bring vnto him. Stroſsi was determined to charge him vppon the ſuddaine, but hee retyred to Seraual and Piſtoye with ſuch diſorder, as it gaue occaſion to manie to wiſh that there had beene a better iudgement in Stroſsi then hee had, ſo faire meanes of hot purſuite beeing offered vnto him, whereby hee might cleane haue taken awaie ſuch an enemie out of Tuſcane, but Stroſsi ſaide hee did it to gratifie the ſouldiers which were wearie, and tyred with the long march which they had made. In the ende, the Imperial armie growing ſtronger, and the ſuccours out of France not being come vnto him, hee was faine to quitte the fielde, and retyre himſelfe into Siene. In the meane time Leon the Brother of Pierre Stroſsi, tooke certayne ſhippes of Genoway, laden with Corne, into which hauing put a number of ſouldiers hee ouerranne the coaſt of Tuſcane, and ſcouring the portes alongſt the Fourentine Seas, after manie harmes which hee had made them to endure, he came and Ankered before Scarlin, a ſmall Towne, and without renowne: which while hee was viewing for the skaling of it, hee dyed of an Harquebuſe ſhot which perced his heade. Whereuppon his Brother beeing greatlie paſsioned, cauſed the ſiege to bee continued whether the ſuccours of Fraunce came vnto him beeing conducted by Monluc. Then hauing vnited together his forces, hee made vp his armye of ſixe thouſand Italians, two thouſand Gaſcons, as manye Zuizers, two thouſand fiue hundred Almanes, and one thouſande horſe, as well light, as of the Ordinance,Ciuitelle beſieged by the French. with which leauing Monluc in Siene hee beeſieged and battered Ciuitelle, a little Towne of the Flowrentines, which the Marqueſſe went to defende eſteeming it a place of conſequence in a fertile ſoyle, and ſeruing as a porte and Bulwarke to the Dukes Countries. Hee was there ſo ſecretelye, and with ſuch ſpeede, as hee defeated and aſtonyed manye of the Kinges parte: but Stroſsi repulſed him in ſuch a ſorte, as beſides a great number of them were taken, and the reſt of them were ſlaine, the garde pryor of Lomberdie and Marie de Saint Flour, and ſundry other of the Marqueſſe ſide remained there captiues. Stroſsi in the meane time beeing enforced to diſcampe ſeeing that there was no poſsibilitye of carrying awaye the place, by reaſon of the Marqueſſe his neighbourhoode, addreſſed himſelfe to Foyanbelle,

a ſtrong and rich place, which Carlot Vrſin helde, who ſent the Marquiſſe worde, that hee was able to defend it but three dayes without ſuccours. But the aſſaulte was ſuch vppon the verye firſt daye, as Carlot and all his ſouldiours were put to the edge of the ſworde, and the place to fire and bloode. Heereupon the Marquiſſe beeing approched, the two armies paſſed certaine dayes in continualle skirmiſhes, fauourable ſometime to the one, and ſometimes to the other partie. And for that the French Artillerie greatlie annoyed the Imperials, who daye by day yeelded themſelues vnto Stroſsi, the reſt were retained by offer of a larger pay, eſpecially the King partie if they woulde retire: which ſome did, and had beene followed by ſundry other, had not Stroſsi playde a Counter knacke in preſenting more pay and fauour then the Marquiſſe. But drawing towardes Montpulcian, a number of Italians abandoned him, which greatly encouraged the Marquiſſe to charge him in this aduantage, which the better to auoide, Stroſsi purpoſing to retire himſelfe by the mountaines, ſent his Artillerie before for feare of looſing of it, thinking thorough the fauour of the mountaines and ryuers bordering about, to retarde the purſuite of the Marquiſſe. Who notwithſtanding preſſed him ſo neere as hauing ſtayed him betweene Martian, Luſignen, and Foyan Royall Citties well beaten with the Artillerie, and the Captaine Bighet an Italian, carrying Stroſsi his Colonell being followed by manye others, Stroſsi was in the ende conſtrained to turne his backe. And albeit that the Gaſcons and Zuizers ſtoode well vnto it, yet their raſhneſſe in going out of their forte to ſet vpon the Spanniards, and Flourentines, was no leſſe damageable, then the cowardlineſſe of thoſe which ranne awaie: for the Cauallerie turning head againſt them, they were all cut in peeces. The Colonels of the Zuizers and Almanes, Clermont, Monbazon, the Captaines Blaiſe, Iean de Ville, François de Record, Agapite Tody, and other to the number of three thouſand, and more then fiue hundred priſonners remained there, the ſecond daye of Auguſt, 1554. The reporte whereof was brought vnto the Kinge before Renti, to abate the ioye of his ſo fauourable a reencounter againſt the Emperour beeing himſelfe in perſon, thorough the ſorrowfull newes of ſo pittiefull a defeate. Manye which were hurt, and ſundrye other, retyred themſelues to Sienne, there to attend ſuch euent as the Imperialles ſhoulde bring thether, Stroſsi and Aurele Fregoſe abandoning Foyan gayned Montalcin,
                  A Captaine puniſhed for cowardly yeelding vp a place furniſhed. whether Bighet beeing come and the Earle of Elfe, who had cowardly yeelded vp Luſignen a ſtrong place, and furniſhed withall neceſſaries, they both had theyr heads ſtroken off. The Marquiſſe in the meane time hauing taken almoſt all the little places about Siene, encamped beefore the cheefe Cittie, reſolued, as hee aſſured the Emperour by his letters, not to depart thence, before it ſhoulde bee yeelded, during which ſiege, the Turkes came into Corſe, to the ſuccour of the French:Turkes come to the aide of the French ſacke all the coaſt of Italy eſpeciallye at the ſiege of Caluy, and Boniface. Afterwardes they returned pilling all the coaſt of Italie, to beſiege Piombin, and and the Ile of Elbe, which appertained to the Duke of Flourence. Paſsing on further they dyd infinite miſcheefes in the kingdome of Naples, Sicilie, and Calabria, from whence they returned riche into Conſtantinople, without anye mannes ſeeking to hinder them, ſo great was the reciprocall hatred beetweene theſe Chriſtian Princes, that they chooſe rather to ruyne themſelues, then agreeing them altogether, to make warre to the profite and honour of all Chriſtendome.
               Now albeit that the endeuours of the Marquiſſe, and the ſolicitations of the

Flourentine by letters, together with ſcarcitie of victuals, were very great occaſions to mooue the Towne to yeelde, yet Monluc reſolued vppon the pointe of honour, and the Sienois for the defence of theyr libertie,Siene beſieged by the Imperials. ceaſed not for all that to make verie faire ſalies vpon the Imperiall campe. An occaſion that they battered it the more furiouſly, with the Artillerie which the Duke drew from the ſtore of Florence. But the courage and reſolution of the inhabitantes prouided no leſſe for the breaches and ruines, which were moſt daungerous, then the payſants of the Countrie about for the neceſsitie of victualles, bringing into the Towne by all meanes which poſsibly they coulde inuent, to refreſhe their Maſters withall, albeit that the rigor of the Marqueſſe, cauſed manye to bee hanged in theyr view. Herevppon Stroſsi hoping ſomewhat of the death of Pope Iuly, an enemie to the French, and of the carriage of Marcel elected Pope, borne at Montalcin in Sienois,Pope Marcel more deuout then wat
                     
                        •
                     er. as I haue tolde you, beſought him to ſuccour his Cittizens, and maintayne theyr auncient libertie. But as new come to the eſtate, and more giuen to Religion then to warre, no other aunſwere coulde bee gotten of him, but Prayers to God to haue pittie on theyr fortune. Therefore ſeeing that Monluc whome hee had cauſed to goe ſee if he could leauie an armie at Montalcin, had done nothing for want of the money which the King had not ſent vnto him, in the ende they addreſſed themſelues to the Duke of Florence. By thoſe meanes the Articles of the Sienois being reiected, the yeelding of the towne was in the end accorded vpon theſe termes,
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Siene yeelded by Compoſition.
                           
                              THat the Emperour ſhoulde take Siene vnder the protection of the holye Empire, and maintaine her in her liberties, and auncient franchiſes. That hee ſhould pardon all ſuch as had borne armes, except ſuch as were baniſhed, or thruſt out of Naples, or any other the territories of the Emperour, Kinge Phillip, or the Duke of Flourence. That hee ſhoulde preſerue the Sienois, in their rightes, franchiſes, honours, goods and dignities, as well mooueable, as vnmooueable, except what the ſouldier had already pilled. That it might bee lawfull for all ſuch as woulde not remaine vnder his obedience, to departe without ranſome. That he ſhoulde put in what Garriſon it pleaſed him, without making or building there anye Citadell, except it were with the conſent of the Cittizens, but rather ſhoulde ruine ſuch as were, the warre beeing once ended. That hee ſhoulde eſtabliſh there ſuch pollicie as hee woulde, alwaies the libertie and dignitie of the common wealth beeing preſerued, and that the auncient Maieſtrates might participate in anye matter of eſtate, and mannaging of newes. That it ſhoulde bee lawfull for all Captaines, Cheefes, Magistrates, Gouernours, and ſouldiers of what nation ſoeuer they were, beeing at Siene for the King of Fraunce to departe, their weapons and goods ſaued, with their drummes ſtriken vp, and Enſignes diſplayed, together with their bagge baggage, traine, and Artillerie▪ to whome ſafe conduct ſhoulde bee giuen, and free paſſage, thoroughout, vntill they ſhoulde bee ariued in their Princes territories. And if within eight dayes they dyd not except theſe conditions, that they ſhoulde no more looke to bee receiued into fauour.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               But the ende carried matter which ſeemed much more grieuous vnto them: to witte that Siene muſt needes fall into the handes of the Duke of Florence. An occaſion that the Souldiours beeyng alreadye departed in ſuch order as is here aboue ſaide, were followed by the moſt part of the Cittizens,

chooſing rather to looſe their goods then to be ſubiect to the Florentines whome they had in almoſt an irreconciliable hatred:Montalcin the retreate of the Sienois. in the end a great number of the beſt Citizens retired to Montalcin, there erecting the bodye and Senate of the Sienois Seigneurie, which they named the auncient Bailiwicke: by which they gouerned theyr eſtate and maintayned themſelues in the ſame pollicie, which they had in the capitall Cittie.Setean taken. Afterwards they diſperſed their Garriſons to Chinſi Roſet, and other Townes of the Sienois helde by the French and their practiſans. In the meane time, the Marqueſſe hauing ſent the Earle Marie de Saint Flour, to beſiege Satean, ſeated vpon the Clan,Port of Hercule a road for the french Gallies ſurpriſed by the Marquiſſe. which hee enforced in the ende to yeelde to compoſition, went to beſiege with the reſt, the porte Hercule, whether the French Gallies retired themſelues at the foote of the hill Argento, not farre from Orbitelle, vpon the coaſt of the Thirrene Seas which De Termes had to that ende fortified by the Kings commaundement.

                   And albeit that it was reſolutely defended, yet they within beſieged, ſeeing themſelues voide of any hope of ſuccours, and all their water fayling, yeelded themſelues, albeit that Stroſsi employed all the meanes he was able, to leauie men at Rome and elſe where, to ſuccour the beſieged, who retyred to other places, whilſt that the Marquiſſe ouerrunning the open Countrie, repleniſhed all, with the feare of his armes. Shortly after notwithſtanding, as Ferdinande Gonzague Lieutennant generall for the Emperour in Lomberdie, diſapointed of his gouernment, retyred himſelfe mal-content to Bruſcelles, to render an accounte of his charge to the Emperour, this Marquiſſe likewiſe malcontented thorough the Duke of Alua ſent as Lieutenant for the Emperour into Italy, &amp; making Dom Garzie de Toledo his Lieutenant, diſcharging all matters without any whit of his priuitie, quitted the armie, and retired himſelfe to his own home.Affaires of Piemont.
               
               To ioyne the ſtate of Piemont and Lombardie to the ſucceſſe of Tuſcane, I haue giuen you to vnderſtand with what happe the deſſeins of the Marſhall Briſſac ſtoode accompanied: eſpeciallie vppon the ſurpriſe of Cazal, one of the moſt importante places of the Countrie. So fortunate ſucceſſe, as that it was accompanied with the diſpite of the loſſe of Cazal and places rounde about. An occaſion to mooue the Emperour (the treatie of peace beeing broken of which I tolde you) to ſende the Duke of Alua into Piemont and Italy, as his Lieutenant generall, there to reaſſemble his forces, and hauing ioyned vnto them the troupes of the Duke of Florence and of the Marquiſſe of Marignan, (who diſapointed of his charge was retyred as I ſhewed vnto you) to take afreſhe new aduantages vppon the French, and driue them cleane out if it were poſsible. The Marſhall notwithſtanding beeing aduertiſed hereof, and of no hope: left of anie peace, the purparle whereof each one trained into length to haſten the premiſes of the warre, made a viewe ouer all his places, and prouided thereunto as was neceſſarie, afterwardes hee munitioned the fortes which he had reared about Vulpian, as well to famiſh it, and depriue it of all ſuccour, as for feare of ſalies on his backe, whilſt he himſelfe made head vnto the D. of Alua, who put himſelfe into the fielde about the end of Iuly, with twentie thouſand men, as well Spanniardes as Almanes and Italians, ſix thouſand horſe of Ordinance, and light Cauallerie, and thirtie peeces of great and ſmall artillerie. Whereupon the Marquiſſe not being able to anſwere him in great, retyred all his forces, which from the month of Iune had bene in the fielde, in number of ten thouſand Suizers, French and Almanes, with two thouſand horſe of all ſorts, fower Cannons, and two Culuerines, about Vulpian: &amp; fortefied himſelfe neere vnto Cazal, which he feared would

bee aſſaulted and attending ſuch ſuccours as he had written vnto the King woulde be neceſſarie for him, he prepared himſelfe to all euents. The Duke notwithſtanding making ſhew as though he had ment for Cazal, tooke Farcinet du Pau, a ſmal Caſtle three miles from thence: where thinking to bring all vnder his ſubiection in a few monethes, thorough the aſtoniſhment of a crueltie neuer before practiſed, among ſuch as vntill then had made faire warre one vppon another,The firſt exploits of the D. of Alua rigorous to aſtoniſh them of the countrie. he cauſed the Captaine to be hanged, the French to be put into the Galleies, and the Italians to be cut in peeces. Afterwards the Capitane La Trinite, commaunding at Valle Feniere, went out by his commaundement with three hundred horſe, and fower hundred footmen to diſcouer, but being charged by certaine French Cauallerie, hee was conſtrained to leaue behinde him a good part of his companie to the butcherie, to retire himſelfe into Aſt, and Alexandria. An occaſion that the D. hauing attempted all the places, where he might make the firſt proofe of his freſh armie, reſolued whilſt his forces remained yet entire, and that he had time and leaſure, no ſuccours being yet come out of Fraunce, to victuall Vulpian with his prouiſions already which hee within two daies thruſt, into the place, about the end of Iuly.Vulpian victuaaled by the D. of Alua. Afterwardes he beſieged Saint Iaco, whereof hee ſuppoſed the fortification to be vnperfect, and the rather for that it was new woulde hardly endure the Cannon. But finding it in other caſe then hee thought for, vnder Boniuet Colonel of the French fanterie, and Ludouic de Birague, accompanied with two thouſand French,Saint Iaco beſieged, battered &amp; leſt by the Imperials. and two Enſignes of the regiment of compt Roquendolfe Almene, two of Italians, and one hundred light horſe of Albanoie, vnder Theodore Beddaine, albeit that by the ſpace of three weekes together hee had beaten to the ground a great parte of their fortifications, without any aſſault, he well knew in the ende by the ſalies and reſolute reencounters of the beſieged, that it was no eaſie matter, to enforce them: Iointe the comming of the Dukes D'Aumalle, D'Anguyen, De Conde, De Neuers, De Nemours, Vidaſme de Chartres, Gonor, and other followed with ten thouſand men, which the King had ſent to reskew the place, animate his partakers, and coole the enemies of his Maieſtie. The gnerall whereof, abating his courrage in the verye eye of the French, who vnited altogether put them ſelues into the fielde to giue him battell, quitted Saint Iaco, leauing the great maſter of the artillerie, and well fifteene hundred men dead there at the ſiege, to drawe to Verſel, taking notwithſtanding certaine Caſtles, which hee ruined, except Gabiano,The D. of Alua retireth. and Bourg Saint Martine, fower miles from Cazal. This departure beeing knowne by the Duke D' Aumalle, reiecting their aduiſe which councelled him to follow the enemie, fering the inconueniences which had at other times fallen out to ſuch as too violently purſued their fortune, ioynte that the whole action was left to his diſcretion, he reſolued to beſiege Vulpian, to deliuer the countrie of the feare of this noyſome garriſon. So vppon the ende of Auguſt, two and twentie thouſand, as well French, as Almanes, Zuizers, and Italians, eight hundred men at armes, and twelue hundred light horſe, were encamped about it, cloſing it ſo ſtraightly in, as Emmanuel de La Lune, ſent thither by the Duke of Alua, to make fiue hundred harquebuſiers on horſe backe, Spaniſh and Italians, to enter in, had no ſooner paſſed the Pau,vulpian beſieged battered and aſſaulted yeeldeth to compoſition. but hee was ſurpriſed and defeated by La Roche-Pozay of Poiton, who tarried cloſe for him, ſuffering verye fewe of them to enter into the ſuccour of the beſieged. But the place beeing battered without ceaſing very furiouſly, for the ſpace of fower and twentye dayes, towardes the Mille, with fower greate Cannons, vnder the aſſuraunce of the Suizers, and with fiue other betweene the Towne and

the Caſtle by the French campe, and then on the ſide of the great bulwarke towards the Caſtle with fower other, it was in ſuch ſorte ſhaken, as the mines trayned vnder the great bulwarke, which flanquered the towne and the Caſtle, being ready, and opening at the very inſtant of the aſſault, cauſed the innermoſt part of the bulwarke to flie vp, where there was ſo large an ouerture made, as the Spanniards and the French, hauing long time in throng bickered together, ſhaddowed with ſuch a darkſomnes but in the end cleared, as perceiuing the beſieged to be at the mercie of the aſſailants, they quitted all the bulwarke except ſuch as yeelded themſelues. But the reſt not able to enter into the Caſtle, fearing leaſt to ſaue ſome the place and reſt of the garriſon might be loſt, were for the moſt part cut in peeces. Among which was a Nephew of the Duke of Aluaes. But Sigeſmond Gonzague, and the Capitane Lazare Lieutenant of the garde to the Duke of Alua, and ſundrie other remained priſoners. The other breach was better defēded, for that hauing paſſed the vp diche in water to the gerdle, they were faine to clyme and grapple vp with ladders, and armors to heauie to carrie. Albeit that the Prince of Anguyen, and of Conde, were there preſent for example to the reſt of the youth. So as many French men remained there dead, and the Earle of Creance ſo ſore hurt, as hee could not eſcape. But as ſoone as the generall had cauſed fower Cannons to bee placed vpon the reſt of the bulwarke to batter the hinderpart of the breach, and play alongſt the ſtreetes of the towne, the required parlie was accorded and afterwardes concluded, that they ſhould depart in men of warre, Enſignes diſplayed, drummes ſtroken vp, goods ſaued, and ſafely conducted as far as the riuer of Drie neere vnto Train, al the munition remaining in the place▪ fower &amp; twenty howers after the Capitane of the Caſtle yeelded vpō the ſame conditions, ſauing that it was reſerued vnto him for his more honour and iuſtification to his generall, that they ſhoulde ſhoote fiftie Cannon ſhot againſt the Caſtle. At this accord, and yeelding of the place, the Marſhall was preſent, about the ende of September, who for many occaſions refuſed to bee at the beginning of the ſiege. Afterwardes the place being as ſoone diſmembred, and vnfurniſhed of all her fortifications, of a faire towne of warre there was made a countrie borrough. This done, the armie coaſting all alongſt the ſtrong places which the Imperials held vppon the waie of Pont d'eſture (which they thought beſt to take before the duke ſhould haue finiſhed his fortifications, being determined therby to make head to thoſe of Cazal, and ſtop the way to the French from Cazal to Turin) skirmiſhed with ſuch as ſailed forth of Trin and Creſcentin. Afterwards the encamped at Velleneuſne neere Cazal, where knowing that the garriſon of Pont d'eſture was lodged euen to the skirts of it, to wearie the French, and in the meane time prouide for the reſt of the places, Automne being already farre entred, and the diſcommoditie of winter, they turned to Montcaluo, which lying cloſe by Pont d'Eſture, ſuſpected nought. The which being taken, brideled Pont d'Eſture, and the reſt of the places vpon the Pan, as farre as the plaine of the Marquiſſat of Montferrat: ſpreading ouer beſides all the bounds of Cazal. Therefore the Cauallerie entertaining a hot repriſall of skirmiſh vpon ſuch as ſalied out of Pont d'Eſture, to couer the diſmarch of the fanterie and artillerie, which they carried for the batterie of Montcaluo, as ſoone ſurpriſed as ſcaled thorough ſo ſodaine arriuall, it cauſed the Imperials to thinke, that they had great intelligences therein. And immediately the approches beeing made with the furie of the Cannon aboue twentie dayes together vppon the great portall of the Caſtle which defended one of the flankers, to breake the defences and diſarme it, it was

no ſooner endammaged, the mine hauing opened the bulwarke which made the other flancke, but they tooke it to compoſition, goods ſaued; the Enſigne diſplaied,Montcaluo taken. with one peece of artillery, three bullets, and three ſhot of powder; but all the artillery which was found there diſmounted, remained, The 17. of October the principalleſt of them being retired to Pont d'eſture, were hanged for yeelding vp ſo ſlightly without any aſſault, the army ſtill remaining about vntill the place was fully repaired. Afterwards the winter approching, the two armies were diſperſed into garriſons,Certain captains hanged for ſo ſlightly yeelding. who did no great matter worthy to be marked afterwards, except it were a running at the tilte with ſharp lances, between foure French men, to wit, the D. of Nemours, De Claſse eldeſt ſonne of Vaſse, the Captaine Manes Rochepozay his Lieutenant, and the Captaine Moucha Enſigne to Pinars againſt the Marqueſſe of Peſcaire, the Marqueſſe of Maleſpine, Dom Albe a Spaniſh Captaine,Combat at the ſharpe betweene 4. French, and as many Spaniards and Italians. and the Earle Charaffe a Neapolitain, Nephew to the Pope: De Claſse and the Captaine Manes were ſo ſore hurt in the necke, that they died within fewe daies after: the Earle Caraffe was pearced cleane through, and died in the place, the reſt returned without any miſchaunce. Moreouer, as the Marſhall Briſsac ſeeing the Winter to come on, cauſed his Souldiers to retyre into the Townes, hauing prouided for the victualling and Garriſon of Montcaluo, vpon the retreate of their companies to their lodginges: it happened about the twentith of Nouember, that Clermontes company retyring towards Cazal, where he was appointed to Garriſon, was ſurpriſed by the Marqueſſe of Peſcaire, followed with three hundred Harquebuſiers, and eight hundred light horſe, which ſtraight put them to flight, all their baggage remaining behinde, with fiue and twenty or thirty priſonners, the reſt ſaued themſelues within Caſal. In reuenge whereof, the eight day of December the Captaine Saluoiſin being aduertiſed, how not farre from him there were two companies of Italian light horſe, departed ſpeedily with a good troupe, marching all the night, and in the morning entred into the village, euen as the Italians were at breakfaſt, whome he diſcomfited and vtterly defeated,Surpriſes of certain companies in Piemont. by the death of two of their cheefe Lieutenants, and well three ſcore other, the reſt remayning priſonners in the French mens handes, who carryed with them more then three ſcore horſe, and a great quantity of armour. Thus they diſturbed one anothers reſt in Piemont, where we will leaue them, to handle againe the renewed trauailes of the French and Imperials in Picardie.
               The Imperial army remaining onely but for the fauour and defence of the forces of Giuets, and Philippe Ville againſt thoſe of Mariembourg, Rocroy, and Mauber fontaine, paſſed away the time of warre without other fruit, auauncing the worke, notwithſtanding the moſt that the Ligeois and Nauarrois was able better acquainted with the nouriture and tedious aboade of the troupes then all the other, the reſt of the Imperials remaining to weary the Garriſons,Deſſeins of the Imperial army. and to put the King to charge in entertaining of them, and conſume the victuall of the Country, making account that Winter being come, it would be very hard for him to recouer, and more hard to put in any more, hoping thereby to cloſe them in and famiſhe them, or at the leaſt they promiſed themſelues what aduantage they would deſire, ouer thoſe that would victuall them anew: an occaſion that the D. of Neuers reſolued, while time ſerued to make a generall victualling, eſpecially at Mariembourg: but the time being conſumed in Sanſac his taking of Emery Caſtle, who was gouernour of Metz in the abſence of the Marſhall Vieilleuille, (which had beene ſurpriſed by the Captaine Beauieu of the Imperiall Garriſon at Theonuille:) Ioynt that the Admiral was not able to bring his men vntill the end of October, and likewiſe the great difficultie to get waggons and

cariages, which the labourers of Champagne and Retelet wearied with their paines already paſſed, refuſed whileſt that their tillage was to doe, was an occaſion that they marched not vntill the 30. of October, that the Admirall went to lodge at Rocroye, with the Vantgarde of fiue hundred men at armes, and ſome companies of French, hauing Sanſac and Bourdillon for auant couriers with the light cauallerie, three hundred Harquebuſiers on foote, and one Regiment of men at armes to ſupporte them, marching all the night, to viewe the woods and giue their aduice, notwithſtanding the great raines and extreame cold, which ſo benummed the men, and eſpecially the draught horſes, that it was impoſsible, for many waggons turned topſie turuie, and broken, to reach but from Maubert fontaine to Rocroy, things not hauing bin made ready in their time and ſeaſon. Afterwardes there arriued the Duke of Neuers with twenty Enſignes of Almanes, conducted by the Reingraue: and for that reporte was brought, how the Prince of Orange taried them in places very auantagious to ſtop their paſſage with his Fantery, aſsiſted with his horſe men and Reiſters, they cauſed not the whole company to aduance forward, for feare of being encloſed in, albeit that Sanſac did ſince aſſure, how the enemy had no ſuch matter in hand: an occaſion that there entred but twenty waggons with Wine and Meale. So the laſt day of October the army was deuided into quarters, in the ſight of the Garriſon, but ſo pittifully handled with colde, haile, and froſtes, that many of the Sentinels were frozen to death, one league and a halfe from the Imperials, being encamped on the ſide of a Mountaine, betweene Sautour and Philippeville. But the firſt of Nouember they ſent out certaine companies to ſeaze the paſſage, and ſtreaſſe the victualers, in whoſe fauour they ſent thither a number of companies to reskew them, and conduct them to the Campe: and there were ſeene two notable chances, the one, how a Spaniſh double reall or twelue pennie peece ſaued a Souldiers life, who had a Harquebuze ſhot but ſixe paces of,A notable accident. without any harme, being notwithſtanding priſonner, he was ſent back againe with mony in his purſſe, by the Duke of Neuers, to carrye newes to the campe, how he alone was eſcaped of all the company: the other, a French Souldier ſeeing his brother to be taken by the Imperials, laid about him ſo luſtely againſt thirtie which helde him,The part of a Brother. that he brought him away ſound and ſafe. In ſuch and like reencounters and skirmiſhes there paſſed 8. daies in great neceſsitie of victuals, and maruelous diſcommodities of the ayre, before Mariembourg: vntill that almoſt all the waggons and carriages were entred in. Then they retired themſelues to the garriſons neere at hand, as alſo the Prince of Orenge to Bruxels to the Emperor, hauing ſufficiently prouided for Philippeuille and Charlemont.
               To enter againe into the eſtate of Almane, Ferdinande K. of Bohemia, aſsigned in that time in the name of the Emperour, a diet at Ausbourg of the eſtates of Almane, to accorde about the point of Religion, and prouide as well for the neceſsities of the Empire, as the particular of each one the yeare 1555. The Proteſtant Princes ſent thither their Embaſſadors, ſhewing that they held with the confeſsion of Ausbourg, according to which if they would giue them ſuretie, they would contribute to all reaſonable charges. Hereupon Auguſt Duke of Saxe, and elector by the deceaſe of his Brother the D. Maurice (whom the Piſtoll ſhot which hee receaued the daye of the battaile againſt the Marqueſſe Albert, cauſed to dye, as elſewhere I haue tolde you) and Touachin Marqueſſe of Brandebourg electors, the Sonnes of Iean Frederic, the Lantgraue, and ſome other Princes neighbours about, aſſembled at Numbourg, vpon the Riuer Solo, and there renewed the alliance which is hereditaire betweene the houſes of Saxe and Heſse. And vpon that they concluded, conſtantly to ſtick to

the confeſsion of Ausbourg. But fearing leaſt ſome ſuſpition might growe of any new and ſecret enterpriſe, the fift day of their aſſemblie, they wrote the cauſe therof vnto the Emperor, inſiſting vpon the article of the treatie of Paſſau, where the peace was concluded as I haue ſhewed vnto you: and proteſting that in all thinges they ſought the repoſe of Almanie, they propoſed the confeſsion of Ausbourg, exhorting euery one to a generall quiet, and beſeeching that hee would not beleeue any which perhaps ſought to trouble the tranquility of the Empire. The K. Ferdinande had propoſed vpon the fifth day of February, ſuch matters as were to be entreated of; but for that many came ſo ſlackely thither, they began not vntill the 7. of March. Then the Deputies of the Princes Electors conſulted of the byls, and againſt the aduiſe of many, they all conſented in the end, to begin with the point of religion. The like was concluded in the councel of the Princes and townes. After a long debate it was agreede that they ſhould leaue religion in peace; but they differed, in that the aſſociates of the confeſsion of Ausbourg, would haue it to be indifferently permitted to all kinde of men to follow their doctrine, and that they might likewiſe be partakers of the benefit of the peace. The other ſide ſtronglye withſtoode that, alleadging that that ought not to be permitted to any Townes, which ſince ſeauen yeares had receaued the decree made at Ausbourg touching religion, nor to any eccleſiaſticall perſon. And in caſe that a Biſhop or Abbot ſhould change his religion, they would haue him depriued of his place, and another put into his roome. They of the confeſsion of Ausbourg alleadged, that the diuine promiſes as wel of the olde as new Teſtament, in which our ſaluation is contained, appertained to all men in generall; by meanes whereof it was not lawfull for them to curtall or ſtraighten them, for feare of ſhutting both themſelues and others out of the kingdome of heauen. There was neither Iewe nor Turk, were he neuer ſo little affectionate to his religion, but would wiſh to drawe the whole worlde vnto it: how much more ought we to be thus encouraged, ſeeing we haue an expreſſe commandement from God for the fame: it muſt needs be then that all remaine in their libertie. Notwithſtanding, to gain peace, they permitted vnto them that they ſhould keepe their faſhions and ceremonies, vſe and enioy all their goods, poſſeſſions, cuſtomes, rightes and priuiledges, vntil the different of religion ſhould be determined. But they would not allow the ſame condition to be preſcribed vnto Biſhops, for thereby it might growe that they ſhould be bound to make warre againſt their allies of the ſame religion, and with great diſhonour condemne their own cauſe, for it were as much as to confeſſe, ſaid they, that our doctrine and religion were not worthy of eccleſiaſticall goods, and that vntill this day ſuch goods had bene vniuſtly beſtowed vpon our Churches &amp; Miniſters. Moreouer, we ſhould confeſſe the Papiſts doctrine to be holy, and their miniſterye grounded vpon the word of God, and that their goods were iuſtly deuoted to their order, life, ſtatutes, and ceremonies: and what a ſcandall would it growe, if we ſhould defend their cauſe and goods, which ſerue to no end in the Church, and contrariwiſe we ſhould betray them whome we ought to holde in ſingular recommendation, by reaſon of the ſame religion. The Catholiques alleadged other reaſons, that if it ſhuld be lawfull for eccleſiaſticall perſons to change religion, within a while Biſhops, and like chapitres would be prophaned, and being cut of from the Churches, would fall into the Princes hands, and ſo remaine vnto them as an heritage: to which they anſwered that there was neuer any ſuch matter meant, but that their entent was to reduce things to their firſt inſtitution, and appropriate them to their true vſages, annexing the goods for euer vnto the Churches; and to take away all doubt, they promiſed

to giue caution that no goods of Biſhops or chaptres ſhould be aliened, in caſe their religion ſhould be changed; prouided that after the deceaſe or reſignation of the Biſhop or ſuperiour, the election and adminiſtration ſhould be left free to them of the Colledge. Now after many differents of the one part, and other as well by wrighting as by ſpeeche, there was in the end agreede and enacted, the fiue &amp; twentith of September, and read in publicque audience, according to the cuſtome, ſuch decree as followeth: the which being well obſerued, hath maintained the Empire and the Almanes in good peace, vntill this preſent.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           The decree of Ausbourg.
                           
                              THat Emperour; the K. Ferdinande, and the reſt of the Princes and eſtates, ſhould doe no wrong to any of the Empire, in caſe whatſoeuer: in reſpect of the doctrine of the confeſſion of Ausbourg, concerning the point of Religion and faith receiued: nor hereafter compel by their commaundements or other meanes, thoſe which were confederate in the ſaide confeſsion, to abandon their religion, ceremonies and lawes, inſtituted by them within their territories; or to be inſtituted hereafter: eſpecially that they haue not their religion in contempt, but leaue them free with their goods, enheritances, cuſtomes, poſſeſsions, and all other rightes: ſo as they may peaceably holde them. That the different of religion be no otherwiſe determined, but by holye, amiable, and peaceable meanes. They of the confeſsion of Ausbourg, ſhall in like ſort behaue themſelues towardes the Emperour, the K. Ferdinande, and the reſt of the Princes and eſtates, addicted to the ancient religion, whether Eccleſiaſticall or Temporall; and towardes all other of the Church, and towards their collegues into what part ſoeuer they ſhall retire to inhabite: prouided that they acquite themſelues of their miniſterie as heerafter ſhall be declared. To all theſe they ſhall permitte in libertie, their religion and ceremonies their lawes, poſſeſſions, tributes and other rights, and no man ſhall hinder their enioying of the ſame. That if any ſuites or proceſſe ſhall fall but, they ſhall be determined both of the one ſide and the other, accordinge to the customes and lawes of the Empire. They which are neither of the one nor the other religion, are not to be comprehended within this peace. If any Archb. Biſhop, Prelate, or other eccleſiaſticall perſon doe renounce the auncient religion, that he quit his Byſhopricke, Prelature Benefice and together there with all the fruites▪ which he hath receaued: which notwithstanding ſhal not any waies turne to his diſhonour or infamie, But the chapitre or they to whome it appertaineth by cuſtome or right ſhall haue power to ſubſtitute another in his roome, ſo as hee be of the auncient Religion. To the ende that the rightes of inſtitutions, election, preſentation, may remaine with the entire poſseſſion of their goods, vppon conditon notwithſtanding that in anye reſpect thereof anie future accorde of religion wherof it hath beene ſpoken, be not anie waies impaired. And for ſo much as certaine eſtates of the Empire, and their ancetours, haue vſurped certaine prouoſtſhips, monaſteries, and like goods, appertaining to the Church, which they haue appropriated to their eccleſiaſticall miniſteries. Schooles, and other holy vſes: that by no meanes they be diſquieted for that, nor called into any courte of iuſtice, but that all ſuch goods ſhall remaine in their order: to wit, all ſuch as did not appertaine to the eſtates of the Empire, or to any other Subiect to the Empire, whereof the Clergie were not in poſſeſsion at the time of the tranſaction of Paſſau, nor after. And that it be not permitted to the Iudges of the Chamber, to proceede by law, or cōmence any ſutes againſt them, or decide any thing, by reaſon of any ſuch goods ſo vſurped or aliened. That the eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction be not exerciſed, nor take place againſt the Leaguers in the confeſsion of Ausbourg, againſt their religion, faith, ceremonies, lawes by eccleſiaſticall miniſteries, but that ſhe haue therin her hands bound, not doing vnto them any disturbance, vntil that the different ſhuld be apeaſed. In other matters not appertaining to their

Religion, ceremonies, lawes, and miniſteries, that they carrie themſelues according to the auncient right, and cuſtome of the Countrie. Further that all Eccleſiaſticall perſons enioye their goods entirely, their reuenues and other rights: prouided notwithſtanding that they in whoſe ſeigneurie ſuch goods are, looſe nothing of ſuch politique right as they had before the diſcorde of Religion. Moreouer that out of ſuch goods they ordaine and maintaine, as heretofore it hath already beene eſtabliſhed, the neceſſarie miniſteries, Pariſhes, Schooles, Almes houſes and Hoſpitals for the poore afflicted, without any regard of what Religion they bee, for whoſe vſe ſuccour, and nouriſhment they be ordained. If for this nouriſhment, and quantitie thereof, there ſhould ariſe any strife or debate, then arbitrators ſhall bee choſen by the conſent of the parties, who after enquirie made therof, ſhall determine within ſix monethes, how much ſhould bee ſequeſtred to the vſe of ſuch miniſteries. During the hanging of which proceſſe, they to whom it doth appertaine to giue aide, and contribute to ſuch vſances, ſhall not bee disturbed in their poſſeſsion, but onely ſhall contribute as they were wont in olde time, vntill the ſucceſſe ſhall bee determined.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Now if the Almanes were willing by theſe meanes to maintaine themſelues in peace, the French Chatholiques ſeemed to be more and more animated towardes the reſearch and curious purſuite of ſuch as they tearmed reformed.
               The K. of Fraunce, ſtirred vp by his fauorites, had made an Edict, by which it was commaunded to all Iudges, to puniſh without delay according to the exigence of the caſe, ſuch as ſhould bee condemned by the Eccleſiaſticall Iudges and inquiſitors of the faith, without any waies deferring vpon any appeales. Afterwards it was ſent to the Parliament of Paris, to the ende it ſhould bee there read, and publiſhed, and after publication enregiſtred in the Grefferie, and proclaimed according to the cuſtome. They of the Courte finding it ſtrange, that the ſuccour, and laſt refuge to the miſerable, ſhould bee denied to the condemned, demaunded a time of aduice, and afterwards on the ſix &amp; twentie day of October, 1555. they ſent deputies of their body vnto the King, to informe him of their opinion, and take in good part the remonſtrances which followe, the which they ſent vnto him at ſuch time as the Cardinals of Lorraine and of Turnon were gone to Rome.
               
                  
                     By your owne Edict (Sire) fower yeares ſince, you haue reſerued to your ſelfe and your Iudges the entire connoiſſance and puniſhment of the Lutherane hereſie, without any exception, ſauing that hereſie required ſome declaration, ere that ſentence ſhould be giuen vpon thoſe that had receiued holy orders. In preſent the Edict whereof the queſtion groweth, ordaineth mearely the contrarie: for it ſubiecteth the people to the iudgment of the Eccleſiaſtical perſons, and of the inquiſitors. In which they diminiſh your dignitie wherein you ſurpaſſe all other Princes; &amp; giue iuſt occaſion to the people to grieue, to ſee themſelues abandoned from you, and made ſubiect to the power of another. But yet the diſpleaſure much more aboundeth, when without the ſuccour of appeale, all their goods, their life and their honour, ſhall be in the power of the ſaide Eccleſiaſticall perſons. For without doubt appeale is the refuge and ſafegarde of innocencie: you are the tutor and protector, as well of the appeale, as of the innocents and ſo is there none but you which hath power ouer the people. Now if authoritie be giuen to the inquiſitors and officers of Biſhops,
                     Appeale of the laſt refuge of the condemned▪ and ſafegarde of innocencie. 
                     to iudge without appeale, it ſhall bee as much as to open a window, and beate a path, for to condemne the innocent, and make them to looſe both body and goods. Iointe, that the iudges of Churches ſeeing themſelues in ſuch authoritie and Royall credit, will forget their dutie, &amp; not keepe within their bounds, ſeeing all eſtates ſubiect vnto them, and managing them at their owne poſt, wil not only leaue to regarde the vulgar ſort, but will carrie no reſpect at all to Princes. It lyeth for all that in you, if it pleaſe you thus to meditate theſe matters. To wit that your Iudges take cognoiſſance of the cauſes, and therein giue ſentence, and if there be found any

doubtfull Article or opinion, that then Eccleſiaſticall perſons may giue reſolution. Likewiſe that ſuch as haue receiued orders be iudged by their Iudges. As touching appeales, that commiſsion may be obtained at the Popes hands, whereby it may bee permitted vnto the ſubiectes, and in caſe it ſhall fall out, that ſentence muſt be giuen of ſuch as ſhall be appelants, that therin they take ſome of your Eccleſiaſticall Councellors, ſuch as ſhall be choſen, or for default of them ſome other notable and ſufficient perſonages. In regard of the inquiſition that it be obſerued, to haue the Popes inquiſitor deputed vnder him thoroughout all prouinces, to be men of good renowne and of entire life. And that the Biſhop be at the charge, and not the accuſed, vpon condition notwithſtanding that the proceſſe being ended, the charges be recouered of thoſe to whom it appertaineth. Theſe things are proper to bound in and encloſe ſuch proceſſe within certaine limits. Moreouer for that it appeareth that by the puniſhments of Heretiques, how neceſsarie ſoeuer they be, they haue not amended them vntill this preſent, but onely it hath beene ſhewed thereby how deteſtable the thing is, and further for that it is farre better to preuent a ſickeneſſe, then to giue it leaſure to grow, and afterwardes apply a remedie, you muſt herein (moſt gracious Prince) follow the cuſtomes and pathes of the primitiue and auncient Church: for ſhee was not eſtabliſhed either by ſword or fire, but the diligence of Biſhoppes hath alwaies reſiſted againſt Heretiques; becauſe that they alwaies inſiſted to preach the word of God, &amp; ſhew good example in their life. Conſidering then how the Church was by this meanes confirmed, there is no doubt but ſhee would still be able to maintaine and countergarde her ſelfe, if you woulde therein vſe your power, cauſing Biſhops and Pastors in their owne perſons to gouerne their Churches, and likewiſe all inferiour miniſters. That they liue holily, and teach the word of God or cauſe it to be taught by perſons ſit. And that hereafter the charge of Churches be not giuen but to men able of themſelues to teach, without ſubſtituting Vicars in their roomes. This is the roote, whereunto the hand muſt be put, this is the foundation vpon which the building muſt be framed: for by this meanes there is hope that hereſies will by little and little vaniſh away. But if no account be made of following this courſe, there is danger that hereſies will encreaſe more and more, what Edict ſoeuer can be made or remedies vſed to the contrarie.
                  
               
               In ſumme, few of the Lordes of the priuie Councell remaining there, which would any waies contrarie the ſame, the Edict which I will ſpeake of elſe where, was engroſſed, in the end cōcluded, and after publiſhed thoroughout the whole Realm, to the contentment of ſome, and diſpleaſure of many other.
               
                  Charles 5. Emperour yeeldeth vp all his eſtates and retireth into Spaine to liue priuately.In this ſame time Charles of Auſtria, Emperour of the Romanes, tyred with the enterpriſe of humane actions, no leſſe then preſſed with his particular inconueniences, reſolued to put end thereunto. So that as well to appeaſe the violence of his Goutes, feeblenes of ſtomacke, megromes, headach, and an infinite of other diſeaſes which day by day diminiſhed his naturall ſtrength, as to ſee the inconſtancie of mundane accidents and ſmall aſſurance in the faireſt deſſeins of man, good fortune the compagnion of manie his actions hauing bene often times enterlaced by the encounter of ſome Signal deſaſtre. Iointe the preſages of Veſalins his Phiſition, and other vpon the breuitie of his daies, he determined to exchange a publique life, vntill then reaſonable well gouerned, with a particular and ſolitarie, which rather carryed a Religious deuotion, then any mundane managing. Therefore hauing from the moneth of September cauſed his ſonne Phillip King of England, to come vnto him, to whome for ſixe weakes together, he communicated his moſt important affaires, and the meanes which he ought to holde in the gouerment of his eſtates, hee cauſed the generall eſtates of all his low Countries to bee aſſembled at Bruxelles, where hee declared the indiſpoſition of his perſon, the good they had receiued from himſelfe, and the fauour which they might receiue from his ſonne whome as

then riſing out of his chayre, and kneeling barehead before and ouer againſt the Emperour, putting his hand vpon his head, he inueſted in all his patrimoniall goodes, &amp; hauing recommended vnto him Religion &amp; Iuſtice, he gaue him his bleſſing. Then the Prince ryſen vp, and due reuerence made vnto his Father, and Queene Mary his Aunt, in the ende turning vnto the people, thanked God for his preſent aduantages, beſought him to aſſiſt him in all his actions to come, rendred thanks vnto the Emperour for the care he had of his perſon from his firſt age vntill that day, &amp; vnto the people for the acceptaunce they had made of him, aſſuring them of ſo good a gouernement, as they ſhould not haue cauſe to repent themſelues of this happe and conſent. Afterwardes Queene Marye dowager of Hungarie,Mary Q of Hungarie Gouerneſſe of the Lowe Countries. Gouerneſſe of the Lowe countries ſeeing the teares trickle downe the graye bearde of the Emperour, his pale and earthly face, roſe vp to declare vnto the people, that for thirteene yeeres together, while her charge endured which ſhee had receyued from the Ceaſareal, and ſhe had employed all the meanes which God had lente vnto her, to acquitte her ſelfe of her duetie, that if any faulte happened, it was vnwitting, and not of any her malice, for which ſhee beſought all them to pardon her, aſſuring her ſelfe that her brother the Emperour reſted contente. This done, the Emperour publiquely acquited all his Subiectes, of their oathes made vnto him, and riſing out of his Throane, cauſed his Sonne to ſitte therein, who preſently receyued the homages and oathes of all his Vaſſalles.Grace &amp; ſweeteneſſe the firſt actions of Princes. Afterwardes all the firſt Seales of Charles were broken in pieces, and in their place King Philips were brought, wherewith there were preſentlye ſealed certayne pardons and other diſpatches. Thus did hee diſſeaze himſelfe of all his goodes and eſtates, to leade a peaceable life in a houſe of pleaſure, which hee had builded in Caſtilia, called Iuſt, reſeruing onely to himſelfe the vſufruite of Caſtilia, and the ſuperintendaunce of all the commaundaries. Afterwardes, by his gratious Letters to the Electours and Princes of Germanie, he beſought them to reconcile themſelues together, vnfoulding vnto them the ſmall occaſion which they had to quarrell one with another, aduertiſing them of his purpoſe to paſſe into Spayne, and howe he had reſigned the Empire into their handes, counſelling and beſeeching them to chuſe his brother the King of the Romanes, whome they knewe to bee of deſarte and age. Fearing leaſt if ſome younge Emperour ſhoulde bee choſen, hee woulde encreaſe the warres among the Chriſtians, (a fitte onuerture to the Turkes to empayre Chriſtendome) eſpecially vpon his neareſt neyghbours.
               In the ende, hee recommended vnto them his Sonne, beſeeching them, that if euer hee had done any matter of woorth for them and their Countrey, they woulde acknowledge it in the behalfe of his Sonne, who beeyng charged with great affayres, had neede of his friendes aſſiſtaunce. At the leaſt, that they woulde not bee contrary vnto him, though ſome particularities might turne them from ayding of him. Hee ſent likewiſe S
                        •
                     uler a doctour to his brother Ferdinando, to yeelde ouer vnto him on his parte all the charges of the Empire, beſeeching him to reconcile the Princes one to another, in which the ſtaye and encreaſe of the Empire wholly conſiſted, the true and neareſt cauſe of the ruyne thereof proceeding from diuiſion. Then that hee woulde yeelde all ayde to his Sonne Philip, as a neyghbour to ſuch an enemye as the King of Fraunce was. In the ende, beeyng determyned to departe, hee was ſtayed thourough the vyolence of his diſeaſes, contratyeties of windes, long ſtaye in the preparation of his Shippes, and thourough a difference fallen out in ſome of the

townes, which would by no meanes receyue his ſonne, the father liuing, and other which woulde haue his nephewe Ferdinande ſeconde ſonne to the King of Romanes for their gouernour. Ioint the male contentment of a number of Lordes, and other, who hauing employed all their meanes, and often times their life in his ſeruice, vnder a hope of great recompence, ſawe themſelues by this his dimiſſion; and departure into Spaine, fruſtrated of all their hope, which they coulde not hope for at his ſonnes handes, who as ordinarily newe Kinges affecte newe ſeruauntes, woulde employe his meanes but to the aduauncement of his fauourites, or in recompencing their paines and ſeruice towardes him, of whome himſelfe had beene an eye witneſſe.
               About the ende of Nouember, Ferdinande King of Romanes, hauing aſſembled together the greateſt parte of his men of warre, wente downe the Danube as farre as Vienne, to make head againſt the Turke, who made great preparation for his deſcente into Hungarie, to beſiege agayne Vienne in Auſtria as I will ſhewe you.
               To open vnto you the affayres and chaunges of the Realme of Englande in fewe woordes: Henry the eyghte, diſcontented in that he had no other heyre but Mary borne of Katherine, aunte vnto the Emperour, whome his brother Arthur had marryed at the age of foureteene yeeres, and lefte her a Virgine, by the aduice of the Cardinall of Yorke, and many dyuines as well Frenche, as Almaines and Engliſh, diuorced her, and hauing in full aſſemblie declared his daughter Marye illegitimate, marryed Anne Bullen, one of his wifes maydes: the which Pope Clemente the ſeuenth ſo hardly coulde digeſt, as that he condemned this diuorce, as vniuſt, and of euill example, eſpecially for that Anne was a Lutherane, and he feared leaſt the King and all his Realme woulde confourme them ſelues to the like religion. Whereat Henrye tooke ſuch diſdayne, as hee declared himſelfe head of the Church thorough out all Englande, with forbidding any to aduowe the Pope for head, or to tranſporte any money to Rome, or paye Peterpence, a reuennewe which euerye houſe yearely payde according to the ordynaunce of Inas in the yeere ſeuen hundred and fourtie: Whereupon there enſued a great alteration of Religion thorough out the whole Realme, ſo confirmed by Edwarde his ſonne, as that the catholique was cleane baniſhed out of Englande, at the leaſt in publique, which cauſed many Engliſhe men to flye the Realme, to ſeeke in ſome other Countrey a place of more free conſcience. Seeyng that the Dukes of Sommerſet and Northumberlande gouerned the roaſte in the yeere 1553. Notwithſtanding as after the death of the Duke of Sommerſet, the Duke of Northumberlande (ſeeyng howe the King was fallen ſicke of a Fluxe, which fell into his ſtomache from the moneth of Februarie) had marryed his ſonne Guilforde to 
                     
                        •
                     an
                        •
                     
                   daughter to the Duke of Suffolke, and couſin vnto the ſicke King, hee wrought ſo much, as that the young King reiecting his ſiſters Marye and Elizabeth, declared for his heyre, and Inherittice vnto the Crowne of Englande, this Iane of Suffolke, to the ende that by this meanes hee mought traunsferre the Royalle into his owne Houſe, and diſinherite the true Heyres of their righte, and legitimate Succeſſion. This Marriage and Teſtamentarie declaration beeyng done in the moneth of May gaue occaſion to a number, to thinke that this young King, whome they helde for the piller of men of knowledge, and gaue great hope of future vertue, was poyſoned, and that beeing aſſured of the time of his death, they had cauſed him to doe whatſoeuer they woulde haue him: well, were it of poyſon or of a Caterre, ſo it is, that Edwarde the ſixte of that

name, and the one and fourtie K. of England, dyed the ſixt day of Iuly, the ſeuenth yeere of his Raigne, and the ſixteenth of his age, ſolemly entered at Weſtminſter, not without the teares of his ſubiects, who ſaide that his death was preſaged by a Comet which appeared a little before his departure, and by the great ſtormes, windes, tempeſts, and thunders, which had that yeere tormented London the chiefe Cittie of the Realme, as the witneſſes of ſuch troubles as ſhortly after enſued in England: for the people hating in ſecrete this Duke of Northumberland, held for ſuſpected the teſtament of King Edward, as a thing made too much to the aduantage of the Duke and many Lords of the Countrie, terming him too ambitious, wrote vnto Mary the eldeſt daughter of K. Henrie the eight, encouraging her to declare her ſelfe Queene, and offring vnto her all dutie and ſeruice. Marye who had no great meanes, durſt not ſo ſoone come to London, to the ende that according to the cuſtome, ſhe might remaine ten daies in the Tower before her Coronation, but went into the Countrie and Dukedome of Norfolke, bordering on the Sea coaſt: from whence ſhee wrote to ſundrie Princes and Lords of the Countrie, complayning how that Iane of Suffolk, had enterpriſed againſt her, and that Edward was not able to diſpoſe of the Crowne which appertained vnto her,Letters &amp; plaints of Mary aſpiring the Crowne of England. being the next daughter vnto the late Kinge Henrie: ſhe laide before them the wrong which had beene done vnto Katherine her mother, and next vnto her ſelfe, and that none of King Henrie his children were to ſucceede before her: proteſting that ſhee would purſue her right by the ſworde, and not ſuffer the Duke of Northumberland to vaunt how he would diſpoſe at his pleaſure of the Realme of England. Theſe letters being brought to London at the ſelfe ſame time as Iane of Suffolke againſt her will, was proclaimed Queene within the Tower of London, cauſed a great chaunge of diſpoſitions among the Lordes there preſent and a ſtrange alienating of their mindes touching the caſe of Iane, whome ſundrie from thence foorth left to take Maries parte. The which cauſed the Duke of Northumberland to ſend certaine troupes of men at armes, into the Countrie of Norfolke, thinking thereby to hinder her deſſeins. But in the meane time ſhee was proclaimed Queene in Suffolke by the principall perſonages of the land. So as hauing recouered ſome ſuccours from the Emperour on the coaſt of Flaunders, (albeit that the Duke had ſtrongly armed vppon the Seas to hinder their comming) ſhee practiſed with a number of the cheefe of the Duke his armie, which in the ende incorporated themſelues to hers. In the meane time Northumberland, to playe on the ſurer ſide, woulde needes haue the Duke of Suffolke Father to Iane, to goe as her Lieutennant generall againſt Marye: for hee durſt not leaue London, fearing leaſt the Londiners woulde reuoulte: But the Duke of Suffolke refuſing to take this charge vpon him, he was conſtrained to goe him ſelfe the other remayning to ſerue to giue counſell to his daughter within the Tower of London. The miſhappe notwithſtanding of this poore Lord was ſuch, as of a great number of men which hee had in his trayne, hee ſaw himſelfe as it were euen in a moment left cleane deſtitute of them all. And as one miſhappe neuer commeth alone, hauing for want of men ſent to London for ſouldiours from thence to come to his ſuccours, and for ſome Lordes which might ſerue for hoſtages and warrant of his lyfe they were no ſooner without the Cittie, but they declared themſelues for Marye. Whereof it enſued that the Duke, who hoped to ſee his Sonne Kinge of England, ſawe himſelfe left of euery manne, and deliuered into the handes of Marye his enemye, afterwardes conueyed to London, where his tryall beeing made, hee then was

condemned to looſe his head, the iudgement being executed in the moneth of September, and Marie being proclaimed Queene at London by the Lords and coū
                  cellors of the whole Realme of England, as the lawfull heire apparant therevnto: and in the end the miſerable princeſſe Iane of Suffolke, with her husband ſonne vnto the D. of Northumberland, had their heads ſtroken off at London, for that ſhee would not releaſe (as ſome ſaid) the right which ſhee pretended to the Crowne. Thus ceaſed the trouble on that ſide within the Realme of England.
               
                  Marie being thus receiued for Queene in England, they propounded vnto her certaine points to effectuate: as to reeſtabliſh the auncient Chatholique Religion, &amp; the goods of the Church into their former eſtate, then that it would pleaſe her to marie with ſome Prince worthie of her and her Realme, thereby to draw a ſuccour vnto the Crowne. Whereupon to the end that better and more ready order might bee giuen vnto the firſt, ſhee was counceled to ſend for her couſſen Raynolde Pole then a Fugitiue at Rome for Religion, who comming as Legate, and with full power from the Pope, might better aduance ſuch a matter then any other within the Realme, Pole being ſent for, and forward on his way with ſuch authoritie as was required, was entreated by the Emperour Charles the fift to viſit him as he paſſed by at Bruxelles: wher he ſo cunningly handled any Engliſhman, as he promiſed him that he would further the marriage betweene his Coſsin the Queene of England, and his ſonne Philippe Prince of Spaine, which tooke ſuch effect as you haue ſeene touching the ſeconde point which could not be ſo ſoone brought to paſſe. The Legate being receiued with great deuotion and magnificence into his Country, was in full aſſembly of the three eſtates of the Realme, begon the 12. of Nouember 1554. reſtored vnto all his dignities, goods and honours, whereof he had beene depriued by K. Henrie the eight. Afterwards vpon Wenſday the twentie eight of that moneth, the Parliament of England being aſſembled, and in the preſence of the King and Queene, hee expoſed his Legation, and exhorted them to returne to the holy Sea of the Pope, deliuering vnto them, how greatly bound they were vnto almightie God, who now had enlarged towards them his diuine grace, hauing beſtowed vppon them two ſuch Princes as they had, further he ſhewed vnto them how the holy Father ment to vſe his benignitie and accuſtomed clemencye, by him his Legate: greatly thanking them for that they had receiued him into his Countrie, and reſtored him in bloud, where in hee had beene ſo long attaint: and how in reſpect thereof hee helde himſelfe the more bound to procure that they might be reſtored into the heauenly Court, as his principall deſire was. That done he retyred, to giue the better cōmoditie vnto the Lordes of the Parliament to reſolue themſelues. And ſtraight waies the Chancellour repeating the words of the Cardinall, ſhewed vnto them how much they were to thanke God, who had rayſed vp ſuch a Prophet of their owne ſeede to procure their ſaluation. In ſuch wiſe as al with a common accorde concluded to conſent to the vnion and obedience of the Church of Rome. So as on the next morrow it was ordayned, that the Cardinals motion ſhoulde be accorded, and to preſent with a common conſent, a petition to beſeech their Maieſties, as the head of the realme to entreate the Legate to procure an abſolute remiſsion of all their errors paſſed: Promiſing to repeale all the lawes, which had beene in former times eſtabliſhed againſt the authoritie of the Sea of Rome. The King ſent the petition to the Legate, and the daye after the Parliament reaſſembled in the place where the Kinge and Queene with the Cardinall were ſet. There the Chauncellour roſe vpp, and with ſuch greate

reuerence deliuered alowde the reſolution which had beene made by the Lordes of the Parliament, beſeeching in the name of them all, that their petition might bee accepted, which was written in Latine, formed and ſealed by the Chancelour. The petition being opened by the Legate, was deliuered vnto the Chancelour to publiſh, who read it with a lowde voice, and that done, put it to the queſtion, which they all paſſed, and vpon that the King and Queene aroſe, and preſented the petition vnto the Legate who read the ſame. Afterwards hee gaue vnto them the Buls of his Legation to reade, where by might appeare the authoritie which hee had from the holy Father to be able to abſolue them: that done, he made vnto the man Oration in Engliſh, ſhewing how much repentance was agreeable vnto God, and how the Angels in Paradiſe make more ioye of a ſinner which returneth to repentance, then of nintie and nine iuſt. And thereupon applied certaine examples out of the word to his purpoſe. Then hauing ended his ſpeech he aroſe vp, and the King and Queene kneeled downe on both knees before him, inuoking God and the Saints, that it would pleaſe him, to pardon the penitent people, in the authoritie of him whoſe perſon he there repreſented, all the faults which they had committed in times paſſed; that done the Legate pronounced a generall abſolution. Afterwardes they all followed the King, Queene and Legate to the Chappell, where was ſong Te Deum. And after that the Cardinall had made his triumphant entries, he reſtored on the firſt Sunday in Aduent to the Biſhoppes, and other Eccleſiaſticall perſons, all the power, authoritie and prerogatiue, which had beene taken from them. On which day, the Biſhoppe of Wincheſter hauing beene before times of the Proteſtant Religion, made a Sermon, after a ſolemne Maſſe, taking for his theame, Nunc tempus eſt de ſomno ſurgere, that is to ſay, it is now time to awake out of ſleepe, as if he woulde ſaie that vnder the Raigne of Edward King of England he had alwaies beene aſleepe. The Queene had in the beginning ſent Embaſſadours to Rome, with commiſsion to kiſſe the feete of his holineſſe, and to preſent vnto him the dutie of a Chatholike Queene, and an obedient daughter of the holy and Apoſtolique Church of Rome, which ſhee acknowledged for the head, Matrice and Soueraigne of all the Churches of Chriſtendome, and mother of all the Princes making profeſsion of the Goſpell. Which was ſo agreeable vnto the Pope, and the whole Courte and people of Rome, that for a publike teſtimonie thereof they made Bonfiers, and ſolemne proceſsions praiſing God for this conuerſion. Afterwards, and in the yeare 1555. an other Parliament was ſummoned in England, in which among other thinges Queene Marie, wrought by all the meanes ſhee was able, that the Abbie lands might bee reſtored, for ſo much as the Pope did vrge it very hard. But by reaſon that the Nobilitie and Gentlemen ſtoode ſeaſed thereof, and that manie had guifts thereof from the King, nothing coulde bee brought to paſſe as ſhee deſired. Notwithſtanding the Queene preuailed ſo much, as the tenthes were graunted to the Clergie: during this aſſemblie they ſcattered and ſowed about London little pamphlets very biting, among which ſome were ſufficiently enough able to moue the people to ſedition againſt the Spanniardes,Libels againſt the Spanniardes in England. (with whome the Engliſhmen playde a thouſand ſhrewd turnes) and to turne the Queene from the loue of Phillip: Great ſearch was made, but it neuer could be poſsibly known whence they proceeded. Before this aſſembly was diſſolued and matters diſpatched, the B. of Wincheſter being Chancelour dyed of a Dropſie; Thomas Heath Archbiſhoppe of Yorke, who before that, had beene in Germanie with him of Caunterburie, and profeſſed the Proteſtant Religion, ſucceeded in his place.
               
                  
                  An accorde beetweene the King and the Duke of Eſtampes, for his clame to the Dutchie of BretaigneAfter the victualing of Mariembourg, and the attempts of Deux Ginets, the King being informed of the auncient clames of the houſes of Blois and Mont-forte to the Dutchie of Bretaigne, to appeaſe with the ſelfe ſame hand the quarrels which were redoubled, by the Lady Anne Queene of Fraunce, and Dutches of Bretaigne, iſſued out of the bloud of Mon-fort, in whoſe right the King himſelfe claimed, to accorde this olde difference with Meſsire Iean de Broſſe, Duke of eſtampes, and Earle of Ponticue, heire of the houſe of Blois rightes, hee accorded in ſuch ſorte, as this Duke releaſed vnto him, for himſelfe and his ſucceſſors Kinges of Fraunce, all rightes, titles, reaſons, and actions, which hee pretended to the Dutchie of Bretaigne, in right of his mother the Ladie Marle of Bretaigne iſſued out of the houſe of Blois, and the King cleane acquited and transferred vnto him the Countie of Pontieure, ſauing certaine Ports betweene Couegnon, and Hauegnon, and the Seicheries of Cornoaille. Whereof autenticall letters paſſed betweene them.

               THe narration of matters paſſed hath made you able to know no leſſe the deſire thē the neceſsitie which the French had of a generall peace, vnder the benefite whereof they hoped to forget all, at the leaſt, part of ſo many loſſes paſſed, and of the preſent miſeries, which cauſed them to feare much more miſcheefe to enſue: you haue ſeene how ſtoute theſe Princes ſhewed themſelues vpon their treaties, by the aduantagious conditions which their Embaſſadours had charge from them to repoſe. In the ende notwithſtanding, yeelding vnto the aduiſe of their Councell, they thought good to renew againe the negotiation. Iointe the feare which the Imperials had of the comming of the Turks,Occaſions which moued K. Philip &amp; Marie of England to harken to a peace. and the deſire of Marie Queene of England to haue her husband ſtill about her, hoping there by to get an inheritor vnto her Crowne, to reſtore the Catholike Church into her Countrie, not to enter league with any one to warre againſt another, to eaſe her Realme of ſo great charges, &amp; not to breede any occaſions of new riots and mutinies amongſt her people: Of all which points ſhee cleane loſt the hope, if her husband ſhould bee abſent, employing in the managing and conduct of warre. Beſides the peaceable nature of this Prince, which made great accounte of the good Councell which his Father gaue him, to procure a reconciliation with all Princes rounde about him, were ſufficient occaſions to mooue him inſtantly to requeſt the Cardinall Pole to renew againe the tearmes of peace: or at the leaſt to conclude a good truce, for a releaſe to ſo great miſchiefes. Whereupon ſeeing the difficultie of articulating the conditions with ſuch aduantages as each one deſired, the truce was concluded for fiue yeares, the fift day of Februarie, 1556. ceaſing al quarrels, and beginning againe to enter traficque, and Marchandiſe one with an other, as well by Sea, as land, euery man retaining what they had gotten and taken by right of warre, without being able to agree vpon their priſonners, (among whome the D. of Aſcot a Flemming, and Francis de Montmorency, eldeſt ſonne vnto the Conſtable were the principall) with many other conditions, which were proclaimed at Paris the ſixteene day of Februarie. And afterwards the Comte de Lallain was at Blois in April to confirme

the ſame with the King, as alſo the Admirall De Chaſtillon was at Bruxelles with the Emperor and King Philip, to receiue there the oath of their part: wherein it was not forgotten to motion a marriage, betweene Don Carlo eldeſt ſonne vnto Philip, and Prince of Spaine, with the Ladie Iſabel eldeſt daughter vnto the King. But if Fraunce and the prouinces which cōfined on the Septentrional ſide, hoped for repoſe during the continuance of this truce, new occaſions of more freſh miſchiefes preſented thē
               ſelues on the other ſide eſpecially towards Italy.
            You haue ſeene the election of the Cardinall Theatin to the Papacie: and for that the houſe of Caraffe, out of which hee was deſcended, and of Melphe, being of the moſt ſpeciall marke within the Realme of Naples, haue alwaies remained deuoted vnto the Crowne of France, which euer honourably entertained them, the Colonois, Vrſins, and other families of Rome partakers of the Emperour, fearing to bee made ſtoope, and leaſt the Pope would too much exalt the friends of the French, whome he might cal into Italy, (for that the Church of Rome pretendeth the Realme of Naples to be of her proper Domanie) and leaſt, together with the graunts made vnto the Kings of France, confirmed by the Popes predeceſſors, and other matters which the King there demaunded, he ſhould make a new ratification, with intent to bee able to preuaile, helde themſelues in the beginning vpon their gards, then as the fearefull man interpreteth, all newter things, ſimple and doubtfull to his diſaduantage, they ſuſpected in ſuch wiſe the actions of the Pope and his confederates, as they well furniſhed with men, armour, and other munition ſuch lodgings as they had within the Towne. Whereof the Pope being aduertiſed, &amp; as ſoone animated againſt them, he leauied men: and by a generall muſter tooke away armes from thoſe whome hee thought had too much: he munitioned the places within Rome, and well furniſhed the Caſtle of Saint Angelo with all neceſſaries. Afterwards, as a man licenſeth himſelfe accordingly, as leaſure and libertie is giuen vnto him, he ſeaſed vpon the ſtrongeſt places which were about Rome, into which he put Garriſons. And at the ſame inſtance cauſed to be impriſoned or aſsigned a brefe day, to the authors of their commotion, among the reſt the Cardinall S. Fleur, Camille Collone, Iulian Ceſarin, and Aſcaigne de la Corne. All which ſtomacking, that they were ſo ſtrangely handled, fled vnto the Emperour and his ſonne, vowing themſelues vaſſals vnto them, where by they might find ſuccour, cauſing them ſo much to miſlike the forme, wherewith the Pope had proceeded, and to doubt in ſuch ſorte the deſſeins of the French partie in Italy, as they ſent ſtraight to the Dukes of Alua and Flourence, to aſſemble all their forces, and hauing ioyned them together with ſuch new as they appointed vnto them, ſo to ſhut vp the Pope and his adherents, that no meanes ſhoulde bee left vnto them, but bare words, to expreſſe the repentance of ſuch an attempt: which they performed in a very ſhort ſpace, hauing by the meanes and conduct of the Colonois among other, regained from the Pope manie fortreſſes, whereof they rendred ſome to theſe complainants. Afterwards building many forts about Rome, neere Oſtia, vpon the banke and courſe of Tiber, they put the Pope in ſuch a ſtraight within the Caſtle of Sainte Angelo, Rome in ſuch neceſsitie, and her ſupports ſo bare of meanes, as they were conſtrained to demaund ſuccour of the King of Fraunce, as of the firſt ſonne of the Church, ſending vnto him by the Cardinall Caraffe, nephew vnto Pope Paul 4. his Legate, a Hat after the faſhion of the auncient Romane Senators, and a Sword, ſignifying the defence of the Church, and Apoſtolike Sea. Who being come to Fontainbleau about the end of Iune, deliuered the preſents vnto the King whome hee ſummoned, and abiured to ſuccour the head of the Chriſtian Religion, according vnto

the title of moſt Chriſtian, which was giuen vnto him thourough the endeuour of his predeceſſors, who had many times reſtored the Popes into their ſeates, againſt tyrants, paganes, and other: eſpecially as his late father in freſh memorie did touching Pope Clement beſieged within Rome, afterwards in the Caſtle of S. Angelo, by the troupes of Charles of Bourbon, and Prince of Or
                  •
               nge, ſucceſsiuely generals ouer the Imperiall armie. To whome hauing anſwered that he would take counſell vpon it, he put him notwithſtanding in a good hope, aſſuring him that hee would faile no whit in the vertuous deportments of his aunceſtors, and would ſuccour the holy Father with al his might, in any reaſonable ſort. Afterwards notwithſtanding hauing giuen aduice to the Emperour and his ſonne, endeuouring to meditate the whole rather by perſwaſions, then to come to action, contrarie to the couenants, ſo ſolemnly ſworne of each parte, for the repoſe of all the Chriſtian Churches. According to which at a feaſt which the King made at Fontaine-bleau, he cauſed before ſupper all the Embaſſadours to retire into the Chappell, in the preſence of whome he told the Emperours to this effect. That his maſter was not able to excuſe himſelfe, but that the warre which the Seigneur Marc Anthoine Colone made againſt the Pope, was maintained, and conducted at his expences and prouiſions. Moreouer this Cardinal had beene not long before ſeene in Fraunce a man of war at the Kings ſeruice, and was ſo fauourably entertained, that he was ſoone laden with preſents. Now for that there was no Biſhoppricke voide at that time, Bertrande the Lord-keeper of the great Seale, being requeſted by the King lent vnto him his Biſhoppricke of Cominges, which he beſtowed vpon the Cardinall Caraffe: and afterwards Bertrande was made Cardinall of Sens. Charles Cardinall of Lorraine,Charles Cardinall of Lorraine and his vyage in into Italy, being returned a little before from Rome, (hauing beene ſent thether to congratulate the election of the Pope, confirme the amitie of the French, and if it were poſsible to draw him in League againſt the Emperour, and who with great capitulations had made Hercules the ſecond Duke of Ferrare, the Kinges Lieutenant generally in Italy) ſeemed to fauour the deſſeine of the Pope.
            In ſuch an occurrence the King wanted no aduiſe, &amp; that very diuers: they which councelled him to breake the truce, laide before him the immortall honour which he ſhould obtaine to defend, yea and to free out of ſuch a ſeruitude the great Pontife the holy Father, and the vniuerſall head of all the Chriſtians in the world; which he was tyed the rather to doe, for that he ſeemed pricked forwardes thereunto, by a generall emulation of ſo many Kings his aunceſtors, who to retire him out of his enemies hands, and to carrie themſelues as the true piller of the Chriſtian building, haue attained and preſerued as it were from hand to hand, that faire and ſo honourable title of Moſt Chriſtian, and eldeſt ſonne of the Catholique Church. They likewiſe ſet before him the incredible profit, which he ſhould make in the conqueſt of that goodly Realme of Naples, which being withdrawne from the Crowne of Fraunce, by the ingenious malice of the Caſtilians, and Aragonois, ſtoode ſo ſmally aſſured betweene their hands, that with the great authoritie which the Pope had thoroughout all Italy, and the particular meanes of his owne houſe within that Realme, together with the fauours of ſo many Princes, who deſired nothing more, then to ſee againe the Flower de Luce better founded there then heretofore, there was no doubt but that the armie which he might ſend thether, would carrie it away euen at their firſt aboorde, conſidering the diſcontentment which the Italians carried againſt the Spanniards, who maſtred them with all kinde of Rigor: and conſidering the ſmall forces which were there, and the retreate of the Emperour Charles the fift: who not to confounde

himſelfe in the vanities of this world, had quitted all his goods, and eſtates thereby to liue priuate,Perſwaſions to periurie. and out of all managing of humaine affaires. And to remoue from him any opinion of diſhonour, which they would imprint vnto him, that diſwaded him from breaking of his faith, giuen to the obſeruing of this truce, they declared vnto him that the accident ſince happened vnto his holines, cauſed ſo much more all occaſions to vaniſh, which might moue him to keepe his word, as the Pope is aboue all the perſons of the world. And as the Sonne could not be thought to doe his dutie, if he did not ruſh vpon his kinſman or allie, what friendſhip ſoeuer were ſworne betweene them, which went about to endamage his Father. So the malicious ambition of Charles, and Philip of Auſtria, who holde the Pope priſonner, to enforce him to doe their will, to the ſeruitude of all Italy, whence they determined to chaſe out the credit of the French, was ſufficient cauſe enough for him, to declare himſelfe protectour of the holy Sea againſt all violence. All good conuentions are lawful and to be kept, but the Pope Chriſtes Vicar is aboue all, is alwaies &amp; in al things excepted, as euery Soueraigne is in a reciprocall oth made among his ſubiectes: for they cannot preiudice the rights of their Prince, much leſſe then Chriſtians the right of the Pope, eſpecially in a caſe of ſuch importance. Iointe that Truces doe not forbid war, but in Countries of obedience, not in other places where they haue nought to doe. Moreouer they do not hinder one from taking vpon him the defence of ſome friend or allie, by a much more ſtrong reaſon then of him, to whome all Chriſtians are redewable for what ſoeuer they haue in this worlde, as to Gods Lieutennant on earth.
            
               Anne de Montmorency, and his nephewes Odet and Gaſpart of Coligny, called Chaſtillon with many others, repreſented vnto him for the contrarie, the eternall and generall diſhonour in all countries, which he ſhould get by breaking his faith, ſo ſolemly ſworne for the repoſe of his ſubiects, &amp; vniuerſall good of all Chriſtendome ſo miſerably torne in peeces, thorough the continuance of ſo vilanous warresl: yea and that there was a time, in which ther was demaunded of Princes only their word for all aſſurances: by reaſon that they ſaw them ſo wiſe and vertuous, as they woulde not change their promiſes for all the aduantages of the worlde. But as the malice of men encreaſed, whereto the Princes by little and little participated, ſo ſubiectes and ſtrangers haue required at Princes handes their faith, and oath, which all men, yea the very Turkes, and other of contrary Religion, hold inuiolable, ſauing at this daye Chriſtians, which firſt made ſhew of being willing to diſpence with ſo Religious a bond, as an oath is: which cannot but turne to the great diſhonour and generall obloquic of all Chriſtendome: the which no longer acknowledging any aſſurance vailable among men, will fall into ſuch a confuſion, that the ſtrongeſt, and moſt malicious, will make ſubiect the good, right, honour and all vertue at his pleaſure. By conſequence then there is no apparance of honour to be gotten in ſuccouring the Pope, who of himſelfe, in reſpect of the dutie of his charge, ought to be aſhamed to aske it, and to giue occaſion to ſuch periurie and diſloyaltie. Yea if he were asked, how hee would truely iudge, or practiſe in his owne act if he were a King, he would make no difficultie to diſſwade ſo pernitious a deliberation: much leſſe the hope of a conqueſt of a Realme ought to ſtur him vp thereunto, conſidering the impoſsibilitie of gayning it, or at the leaſt keeping it, by men ſo farre off, ſo euill husbands, and bad prouiders againſt a nation ſo neere and wel aduiſed as the Spanniard: and eſpecially that this hope is founded vpon the amitie of Italians, whome we haue found for the moſt part vnconſtant, and variable in their duties, as ſo many examples paſſed may verye

well make vs wiſe enough, to counſaile well therein our ſuruiuours. And it is ſo farre off, that the farre diſtance of the Emperour ought to encourage vs to doe euill, as the good aduices wherewith he hath inſtructed his ſonne: the aduiſed and prouident perſonages, which he hath lefte vnto him for counſell: the alliaunce of the Engliſh which will furniſh him both with men and money: together with the reſolution which he hath not to degenerate in ought from the vertues of his father, nay rather to encreaſe them higher, if occaſion did preſent it ſelfe, ought to make vs the more to feare the vndertaking thereof, and to aſſure vs that we ſhall find ynough, nay more forces and meanes to ſtay vs euen in the beſt of the enterpriſe, then if the father himſelfe had taken the conducte thereof. All this notwithſtanding, and many other reaſons which were alleadged, coulde not hinder the breach of the truce and the expedition which was made into Italie, chiefely in the ende by the diligence of the Coneſtable. For albeit that he helde a hard ſtring to the contrarie, yet hee ſlacked for two occaſions. Firſt, that he perceyued, through the abſence of theſe vndertakers, he mought haue faire and eaſie meanes to make great and aſſure his houſe: ſo as hee was not in the ende ouer ſorrie, to ſee them of the houſe of Guiſe, bearing armes to quitte the Courte, and goe the voyage, whereof hee hoped for no happie euente. Iointe, that he ſought to marrie his eldeſt ſonne, (whom 50000. crownes had a few dayes before redeemed out of priſon) with the widdow of the D. of Caſtre,Marriage of Mareſchall Montmorency eldeſt ſonne to the Coneſtable. the kings aduowed daughter. Whereupon the marriage being accorded, euen as it ſtood vpon the poynte to be accompliſhed, his ſonne let him to vnderſtande in October, by Odet and Gaſpart of Coligny his couſin germanes, howe he had made a promiſe vnto the Ladie of Pienes, &amp; that he coulde haue no other. Whereat the father grieuouſly diſpleaſed, endeuoured notwithſtanding by all meanes to accompliſhe this marriage. So as hauing cauſed Pienes to be put in ſure guarde within the houſe of Filles Dieu, he conſidered with himſelfe, that herein he ſhoulde ſtande in neede of the Popes aſſiſtance, vpon that he ſent his ſonne to Rome,The Pope the laſt ſuccour to flie vnto for breach of truce and oathes. where he found Pierre Siroſſy mareſchall of Fraunce, and they beganne together ſo well to beſturre themſelues for the Pope, as they recouered agayne the porte of Oſtye, and other places occupied by the Spaniardes about Rome, which ſerued him but as a priſon. And yet all the meanes which mought be, was wrought with the Pope, that he ſhould not diſpenſe with him to marrie any other then Pienes: fearing leaſt that being once obtained the Coneſtable would breake the deſſeins of the warre. Whereof he being aduertiſed, and ſeeing howe the Pope vſed him but with delayes, &amp; diſſimulations, he beſought him to contente himſelfe with the ſeruice which he had done vnto him: So as hauing taken his leaue, he retourned to Paris, a few dayes before Eaſter, 1557. declaring vnto his Father, that that which he let him to vnderſtande of the promiſſe which he had made vnto Pienes, was only to induce him vnto the marriage, but that in trueth there was no other matter, in ſuch ſorte as preſently after the marriage was accompliſhed with the Lady of Caſtres. The denyall thereof notwithſtanding proceeding from the promiſſe, which he mainteined he made vnto Pienes, was the cauſe of an Edicte which was then publiſhed, for the reciprocall duetie of parents and children, vpon the occurrance of their marriage.

of all aduantages and profites, which they might pretende by the meanes of nuptiall conuentions, or by the benefite of cuſtomer or lawes of the contrarie. And that the fathers and mothers may reuoke any guifts, and aduantages giuen by them. They likewiſe declared puniſhable which ſhall giue counſell &amp; ayde for the conſummation of ſuch marriages. That this ordinance ſhall take place as well for the time to come as paſſed; becauſe there is therein a tranſgreſſion of the lawe and commaundementes of God, wherein no man may couer himſelfe, by any ignorance, or fooliſhe errour to the contrarie. Reſerued notwithſtanding ſuch marriages, as haue bene heretofore conſummate by carnall cohabitation: and not comprehending ſonnes aboue the age of thirtie yeeres, or daughters of fiue and twentie, prouided that they vſe all duetie to ſeeke the aduice and counſell of their father, and mother. It grewe then when as the Coneſtable beganne to miſlike the enterpriſe of Italie, as I will tell you elſewhere.
                     
                  
               
            
            Hereupon the Cardinall carryed tydinges of the whole vnto his Holyneſſe, whileſt that the King ſent the Popes griefes vnto the Emperour, and his ſonne as it were to be the meanes to render him content. Ioint that he woulde not ſo ſoone attempt any thing againſt them, for the opinion which hee conceyued, that they were not conſenting, and leſſe the authours of ſuch nouelties. Some aſſuredly gaue out, that Philippe anſwering more eagerly then his Father, ſayd that for his parte he deſired the continuance of the Truce,The King of Spaines anſwere to ſuch griefes as the K. alleadged on the Popes behalfe. and rather a peace if it were poſſible to bring it to perfection. But howe he had alwayes founde the Pope, and his affinitie ſo great an enemie vnto his houſe, that whoſoeuer woulde declare himſelfe his friende vndertaking his defence, he woulde holde him for an enemie, &amp; ouerrunne him with all his forces. This notwithſtanding, the King ſtirred not of a long time any whitte in the Popes fauour, were it that his meanes were not yet in his hande, were it that he perſwaded himſelfe verie well of K. Philips good inclination to the continuance of the Truce, by the report of Renard his ambāſſadour, who aſſured him that his Maiſters intention was cleane contrarie to the aunſwere aboueſaide, o
                  •
                elſe that he hoped that the truce woulde not leaue to be kept inuiolable in this caſe, nowe that the Imperialles armed themſelues in Italie for the reſtitution of the Colonois: yea ſo farre as by playntes, and requeſts redoubled, they knew that they were entrenthed at Rome gates, where the Pope was ſtraightly encloſed within the caſtle of S. Angelo. And further how Octauian Farneze ſolicited by the Imperialles, and gayned by the Cardinals Farneze his brother, &amp; S. Fleur his couſin, was reuoulted from the King to them, who a little before cauſing his father to be ſlayne, woulde diſinherite him, which made him to liſten eare vnto them, who aſſured him that they meant to raunge the Pope to the will of the Emperour, and chaſe the French out of Italie. So as the King reſolued to breake the truce, determined to ſende an armie vnder Francois de Lorraine Duke of Guiſe, compoſed of 6000. Switzers vnder the Colonel Frel
                     •
                  , and 4000. French vnder the Duke of Nemours, with 500. men at armes, and 500. light horſe, who hauing late enough made readie his preparatiues, was enforced diligently to haſten to paſſe ouer the mountaines of Sauoy, and the Alpes in the great froſtes and infinite trauayles which Winter brought with it. Such was one of the principalleſt occaſions of this warre. I leaue the pretence of the Realme of Naples, to thoſe who fanſie it vnto themſelues againſt thoſe of Guiſe, without any great apparance. Iointe likewiſe the particular reaſon, which ſome alleadge, to ſhewe howe theſe Truces made, and entertayned in diſſimulation, were but to couer the progreſſe, and effectes of ſuch intelligences as theſe Princes had one vpon another. I will recite vnto you the meanes by which the Imperialles as the Frenche reporte, gaue iuſt occaſion vnto them to breake the Truce, and deſpayre of a peace.
            
               Without agrauating ſay they,Particular cauſes of the breache of Truce by the Imperialles. the rigorous entertainement made vnto our priſoners of warre, more cruell then could be among the Moores &amp; Infidels: Yea leauing apart how the D. of Bouillon was villanouſly, and trayterouſly poyſoned, and afterwardes ſolde being dead, it is moſt notorious, that a fewe dayes after the concluſion of the Truce, euery man on this ſide, liuing with a hope of peace at hand, it was verified by the reporte of the conſpiratours, how many enterpriſes had bene attempted vpon the principall Townes of this Realme, as of the ſouldiers of Metz reſolued to yeilde the Towne, at the purſuite of the Compte de Meigue, Gouernour of Luxembourg, and with the priuitie of the Prince of Piemont. The intelligence vpon Bourdeaux in Guienne at the conduct of Barlemont, Generall of Finances to the Emperour, a little before Eaſter, and a moneth after the Truce accorded. Few dayes after there was taken an ingener, and maker of fortifications, named Iaques de Flectias, who confeſſed that he was ſente by the Prince of Piemont, to viewe, and draw the plattes of the principall Townes vpon the Frontire, with money impreſt, as Montreul, Saint eſprit de Rue, Dourlan, S. Quentin, and Mezietes. Beſides a prouenciall ſouldier ſubborned with great preſents to poyſon the Welle at Mariembourg, and conſequently the whole Garriſon, therby to make the ſurpriſall of the towne the more eaſie. Thus did the Emperor firſt infringe the Truce contrarie to the publique oath. Albeit that all contractes and accordes eſpecially among Princes (who are themſelues to be example of the greateſt conformation to the Lawes which they make) ought not only to be without deceit and malice, but exempt of all ſuſpition, conſidering that therein, beſides the duetie of conſcience, and of an honeſt man, their particular acte alone is not compriſed, but the whole good, and vniuerſall repoſe conſiſteth. They adde thereto the great preparations of men, and money, which Philip ſecretly made of all partes, namely at the ſolliciting of the King of Boheme, and Princes of Germanie, to vndertake a warre againſt the King, for the recouering of free Townes, without ca
                  •
               ſering his Captaines &amp; men of warre. So as ſoone enough the Garriſons of Meſneil, beganne to ouerrunne the platte Countrie, about Abbeuille, S. Eſprit de Rue, Auannes, Cymetz, Roc-Roy, &amp; Ambenton, vnder colour that famine enforced thē therunto. Henry thē hauing ſeene how K· Philip ſtil proceeded on againſt the Pope, and helde Rome beſeiged, ſent worde to Pierre Strozzy (to whome he had giuen the office of Mareſchall of Fraunce, in the roome of the late Mareſchall de Sedan) that he ſhould put himſelfe within Rome, &amp; abide the brunte of the Spaniards, vntil that the ſuccours ſhould be ariued out of Fraunce. In this meane ſpace, Don Iean de Lune,
               Iean de Lune a Fugitiue into Fraunce. malcontent with King Philip, retired from his ſeruice into Fraunce, towards King Henry, who courteouſly receyued him, and gaue him an honeſt penſion to mainteine him, in ſuch ſorte as it was not poſſible for King Philips miniſters to induce him to retire agayne into Spayne, what fayre promiſes ſoeuer they made vnto him. Some ſay that the Gouernour of the Caſtle of Milan fledde, being ſuſpected that hee woulde haue deliuered it vp to the King. The which other auowing to be falſe, ſay that the matter was about a quarrell betweene him and Ferdinand de Gonzague being diſappointed of the gouernement of Milan, by the meanes of Don Iean de Lune, and the Chauncelour of Milan. For Gonzague being afterwardes returned into fauour, and purged of the crimes layde vnto him, purſued in ſuch ſorte Don Iean de Lune, as he being angrie at the ſmall reſpecte, which was carryed to the great ſeruices which hee ſaid hee had done the Emperour, lefte Milan, and came into Fraunce, without euer making any practiſe againſt the catholike K. The Emperors partiſans in the meane time, the better to ſettle his affayres in Italie, &amp; ſeeing how greatly Octauian Duke of Parma, and

his territories (the defence whereof had coſte the Frenche ſo much) mought aduauntage him, eſpecially in ſuch an occurrence, employed the Cardinall of Trent, to gayne him vnto the Emperour, quitting King Henry, who had done him ſo great good, and for his ſake had made warre againſt the Pope and Emperour, to the ende that the Duchies of Parma and Plaiſance might bee reſtored and aſſured vnto him. In ſumme the Cardinall Madruch, Biſhoppe and Lorde of Trente, was he,Plaiſance rendred to Octauian D. of Parm
                     ••
                  
                who according vnto the Accorde betweene the Catholique King and Octauian, reſtored him into the poſſeſſion of Plaiſance, where hee made his entrie verie ſumptuouſly, and declared himſelfe againſt the Pope and all his allies. The Duke of Alua in the meane ſpace, ouerranne and ſpoyled the terretorie of Rome, and beſieged the citie of Anagne, which the Popes ſouldiers abandoned, hauing burned all the powder and munition. The which aſtonied in ſuch ſorte the Cardinalles at Rome, as they gotte the Pope to ſende to the Spaniſh Generall to parley of Peace, but all in vayne, for as much as the Popes deputies were not at the breake of day appoynted for the Pourparley. Which made the Duke ſo angrie againſt the Pope, as hee ruſhte vpon Pilaſtrine and Segue, which yeelded: whileſt that the Cardinall Caraffe fortified Bellitre, attending certaine troupes out of Germanie, which he cauſed to come, in hope of which and of the frenche Succoures, he would by no meanes ſuffer any parley of Peace, ſaying that it was not beſeeming for the Pope to ſeeke him,Point of Honour in a Cardinall. who was but a miniſter of a vaſſall Prince, &amp; feodarie to the holye Sea.
            Alreadie did the forces of Tuſcane ouerſpread the countrey of Rome, where the Mareſchal Strozzie was. In ſuch ſorte as Monluc was to viewe Tiuoly, to ſee if it were tenable conducting ſeuen hundred Gaſcoignes to defende it, in caſe there were any meanes to fortifie it. But ſeeing the place too feeble to endure a ſiege, and leſſe proper in any ſhorte time to be fortified, he lefte it, giuing leaue to the Citizens to prouide for themſelues, and to yeelde it with the beſt aduantage they coulde poſſiblie make for themſelues, as they did.
            After, Monluc being returned to Rome, and F. Vrſin to Vico-Valerio, the Tiuoliens yeelded them ſelues vnto the Duke of Alua: which were followed by them of Vico-Valerio, in deſpight of F. Vrſin, who woulde haue defended the place for the Pope, ſeeing howe neceſſarie it was to hinder any victualles comming to the Spaniſhe campe from Naples ſide.
            Beholde howe the Duke of Alua was able to holde Rome in ſubiection, hauing the places rounde about at his deuotion.

Attending the ſuccours out of Fraunce notwithſtanding, Alexander Colomne, which followed the Popes partie, was of opinion that Rome being deuided into diuers quarters, there ſhoulde be in euery one a ſeuerall Captaine put,The meanes which the French and Italians helde to a li

                  e Rome and the Pope againſt the enemies attempts attending ſuccours out of Fraunce. with his troupes to defende it. Therefore Alexander was made Colonell of all the Romanes, which mought amount to 7. or 8. thouſand, whom he diſperſed into places as he ſawe neede, entermingling among them ſome Enſeignes of ſouldiers, as well Italians as Gaſcoignes. So as Lanſac had in guard the gate called De Populo, hauing 1000. Gaſcoignes vnder his charge. The D. of Palliane, nephewe to the Pope, had the keeping of the gate S. Agnes, hauing 800. Almanes in his company. Iourdan Vrſin come out of Corſe, cōmanded 6. Italian companies at the gate of S. Lawrence, the Cardinall Caraffe at S. Sebaſtian, hauing 500. Italians, and the reſt of the Gaſcons were vnder Monluc his charge at the gate S. Paul. Aurelie Fregoſe kept betweene the

Tiber, with 1500. ſouldiars, Camille Vrſin commaunded the quarter of S. Peter, with 2000. footemen. So as theſe troupes pefourming well their duetie, the Spaniſh Generall durſt not hazzard himſelfe to make any attempt to the towne, onely hee kept himſelfe ſlyelie watching his commodities, aboue all to cutte off victuals, whoſe temporiſing notwithſtanding was an occaſion, that the Cardinall Caraffe went into the fielde, ouerranne &amp; waſted the Neapolitane countrie, whileſt that the D. of Alua, was buſied about the Iſle &amp; Citie of Oſtia,Oſtia taken by the D. of Alua. whereof he made himſelfe Maiſter to the great diſaduantage of the Romanes. This place being ſeated vpon the mouth of the riuer Tiber, where ſhee falleth into the Tyrrhene Sea, which vpon this occaſion ſerueth as a chiefe Magaſin for the bringing of victuals to Rome. Notwithſtanding hee tooke not the Towre and Forte of the Cittie at that blowe. In the meane time the Pope haſtened forwardes the Kinges ſuccours, and ſollicited him harde, not to ſuffer the Duke of Alua thus to ſpoyle the holy Sea: as he likewiſe did vnto the Venetians, hoping to drawe ſome ſuccour from them,The Venetians ſuccour not the Pope. but that Seigneurie comforting him with woordes, condoled his grieuous miſhappes, without vſing any other duetie, or office of amitie, ſauing that they tooke paynes to ſeeke to appeaſe the differents, and mediate a peace betweene him and the Spanyardes. While theſe thinges were a doing, and the Spaniard battering the Forte of Oſtia, the Mareſchall Strozzie came to the ſuccour of it with ſuch Troupes of Fraunce as he had, rearing vp certayne rampiers, and retrenches, that the enemie ſhoulde not carrie away the cattell, and other goodes of the Romanes, encloſed within that Iſle. About the ende of December, the King, as I tolde you aboue, diſpatched the Duke of Guiſe for to be Generall of the armie, which his Maieſtie ſente to the ſuccour of the Pope, and with him Duke Aumalle, and Duke Elbauſe his brethren, the Duke of Nemours,The D. of Guiſe matcheth to Rome with the French armie. the Earle of Eu, the Vidaſme of Chartres, and other Chiefetaines, all which mette together in Ianuarie 1557. (hauing ouercome with a conſtant and opinatiue patience, the ſharpeneſſe of Winter, and difficultie of the Alpes,) at Turin the chiefe Citie of Piemont. For feare of whome the Spaniardes fortified Milan, knowing that the Frenche armie was compoſed of ſuch a nomber of men, as I haue tolde you.The port of Oſtia rendred by compoſition to the Spanyardes. During which time, ſuch as were beſieged in the Forte of Oſtia, hauing abidden many aſſaultes, their powder fayling, their ſouldiars and citizens for the moſt parte hurt, in the ende yielded them ſelues by compoſition, which Aſcaigne de la Corne cauſed to be accorded reaſonablie enough, whereat the Romanes were ſore abaſhed. So as by the meanes of the Cardinalles of S. Iaques, and of S. Flour, they came to make a Truce for tenne dayes. During which, the Duke of Alua finiſhed the Forte which he had begunne in the Iſle, bordering on the porte of Oſtia,Truce betweene the Pope and the D. of Alua. whither the Cardinall Caraffe wente vnto him, of whome he procured the prolonging of the Truce, free and marchandable for fourtie dayes, with a hope of a generall peace. But Caraffe tended to no other thing, then to ſolace his owne vntill the ariuall of the Frenche, of whome hee helde himſelfe alreadie all aſſured. And in the meane time hee aſſayed to drawe the Venetians to the partie, who in the ende refuſed to declare thēſelues againſt the K. of Spayne. But the D. of Ferrara followed the Popes partie, as well for that he was a vaſſall and feodarie, as in fauour of the K. of Fraunce, following the aſſociation alreadie concluded and agreed betweene them. So had he alreadie aſſurance, as I ſayde before, of the title of Defendour of the Church,D. of Ferrara named the Defender of the Church. which the Kings of England were wont to carrie. The League betweene the Pope, the K. &amp; the D. of Ferrara carried: That the Pope ſhould to the nomber of twentie thouſand footmen, &amp; one thouſand horſe furniſh the whole charges of the armie.

The K. ſhould put the like nomber of fanterie into the fielde, and 2000. horſe, &amp; the Ferrarois 6000. ſouldiars, 200. men at armes, and 400. light horſe with 20. peeces of battery.League between the Pope, the K. of Fraunce and D. of Ferrara. Thus the D. of Guiſe being entred into Italie, with an aſſured hope to ioyne ſuch ſuccours to the forces which I haue ſhewed you, and a great nomber of the nobilitie which followed him for their owne pleaſure, (&amp; ſuch as he mought well vaūt that he had neere hand the two tierce of the flower of the nobility of Fraunce) could not imprint into the heads of the Italians, but a feare of great miſchiefe to enſue vnto all Italie, which he put into armes, in diuers hopes and dangerous partialities, through a ſuddaine entrie of ſo many people. Moreouer euerie man doubting with himſelfe, and fearing leaſt vnder the colour of the Popes ſuccours the D. of Guiſe would giue elſewhere, was an occaſion that firſt they fortified Milan, with all her dependances. Then they prouided ſuddenly ſtrong Garriſons for Cremone, Pauia, Lode, Aſt, Valence,Italie in armes upon the comming of the French. and other places of importance. And in the meane ſpace the Duke of Florence; armed himſelfe, and put Garriſon vpon the Frontiers of Ferrara. He furniſhed with ſouldiars Florence, Piſa, and other Townes vnder his obedience in Tuſcane, and aboue all, thoſe which neighboured vpon Bologne.
            
               The D. of Alua his diſſeins.Vpon this the Duke of Alua, who was no whitte ignoraunte of the Spaniſhe forces comming againſt him, was once vpon the poynte to retyre to Naples, as well for the doubte which he had, that he ſhoulde not be able to ſuſtayne the furious aſſaulte of ſo freſhe Troupes, as to drawe them and hemme them in within the enemies Countries, thereby by little and little to conſume them with Famine, and other diſeaſes: and had done ſo, but for the Counſell of Ferdinande Gonzague: He reſolued then for the more expediente to reſte there, and to ſende Garzie de Toledo, the Compte de S. Flour, Veſpaſian Gonzague, and other of the Realme of Naples, to furniſhe the Townes of Capue, Arian, Saint Agathe, Venoſe, Nolle, Ciuitelle, Aterne, and the reſt which are vpon the Calabrian Sea: Iointe that the bruite ranne howe the Turkiſhe armie was to lande there in fauour of the French, as it had before done in Corſe.The firſt attempts of the French armie ioyned with the Mareſchal Briſſae. The Duke of Guiſe in the meane time hauing ioyned his forces in Piemont, with the Mareſchal de Briſſaes, was at Valence, which had for Garriſon two thouſande ſouldiars, parte Italians, parte Spaniardes, and Grizons vnder Spoluerin.
            
            Nowe, as the Duke of Guiſe had cauſed the bruite to be giuen out, that they had taken Pauia, and that the Duke of Guiſe had cauſed Valence to be ſummoned to yeelde, or that if hee tooke it by force, he would vſe all the cruelties which coulde be looked for in a mortall warre, Spoluerin fearing the loſſe of his great wealth, did ſo much after ſome ſkirmiſhes, and nomber of Cannon ſhotte, as the ſouldiars condeſcended to the yeelding of the place, prouided that they mought be ſuffered to depart, liues, &amp; goods ſaued, the which was graunted vnto thē about the 8. day of Ianuarie. 1557. But this Captaine Spoluerin and many other of the Garriſon,Valence yeilded vp to the D. of, Guiſe. being retyred to Pauia, were beheadded for yeelding ſo cowardly, hauing victuall and munition at commaundement, within a verie ſtrong place, and without ſeeing ought which mought mooue them to yeelde it ſo ſoone. It was then, as the Cardinal of Trent, ſent to ſummon the D. of Guiſe, to render Valence vp into his hands, the which he had takē againſt the articles of Truce: but it was anſwered him, how the D. of Alua hauing firſt brokē, he ought not to maruel if he followed his example: &amp; therefore that he looke for no other effect at the handes of the French then warre, vntill that reaſon were yeelded to thoſe which were moſt intereſſed, further, that hee had iuſtly handled them of Valence, for that his forces marching to

the ſuccour of the Pope, had bene braued by that Garriſon, the which had ſaluted thē with Cannon ſhotte. As the Duke of Guiſe marched towardes Rome, Strozzy, Monluc, and the Duke of Palliane, perceyuing the Duke of Alua to be retired from before Rome, beſet Oſtia, with fiue hundred ſouldiers, as well Italians as Gaſcoignes,Oſtia and

Afterwardes, they beſieged the Forte, the which was yeelded vnto them in the ende by compoſition, and the Spaniards departed, liues, goods and weapons ſaued with ſome pieces of artillerie. At the verie ſame time, the Popes people tooke from the Spaniardes, the townes of Bellitre, Tuſcule Marin, (which was in olde time called Villa Marij, and Grotta Ferrata, ſome holde it was Cicero his place and Seigneuriae,To vnes taken from the Spaniardes. which he called Tuſculanum) and diuers other within the territorie of Rome: They tooke beſides Paleſan, and S. Ange, a forte ſcituate vpon a mountaine: S. Paul being likewiſe beſieged by the enemie. The Duke of Palliane ſuccoured by the Mareſchal Strozzy was there, and receyued the place agayne being abandoned by the Spaniardes. Then he was to beſiege Vico-Valerio which he tooke by aſſaulte, and put to fire and ſworde all thoſe which they mette in armes, giuing the pillage to the ſouldiers. All this paſſed ouer vnder the onely fright of the name of Guiſe,The D. of Guiſe taketh Coun

In the meane time the Duke of Guiſe ſhoulde goe towardes Ferrara, paſsing thorough the Countrie of Plaiſance, the which was accordingly done. But not without the Marques of Peſcaire his continuall being at his tayle, without any great preiudice notwithſtanding, by reaſon of the good order which he gaue in the diſcamping, &amp; conduct of his armie, the which was furniſhed with victuals in the Placentine Countrey, by the commaundement of Octauian Farneze D. of Parma: which the D. of Guiſe cauſed to be payd for, expreſly forbidding any ſouldiar to doe wrong to the ſubiectes of this Prince. We will leaue then for a while the D. of Guiſe marching with his forces in Italie to the Popes ſuccour, to enterlace you here an accidente, as ſtraunge, as any which hath happened in the memorie of our forefathers.

                   &amp; the diſcourſe of his life. borne at Delph in Hollande, an authour of a peruerſe ſecte, making himſelfe to be named by his followers, King and Chriſt immortall, dyed the yeere pasſed, 1556. the 24. day of Auguſt, and his wife a little before retired with a verie great familie of her owne to Baſle in the yeere 1544. He ſayde he was fled his owne Countrey for the Goſpels ſake, and there bought houſes, and a Caſtle neere vnto the towne called Buiuignen, with landes of great reuennewe. He was verie cunning, of great Spirite, and had his eyes addresſed on all partes to gayne the heartes of many, and an exteriour reputation, which was mainteined and greatly augmented by his riches, his money, and moſt precious moueables, which he had brought thither, and which men brought vnto him day by day, as well out of the high, as lowe Countries of Flaunders, as it falleth out, that almoſt all men ſuffer themſelues to be couſined with an apparaunce, &amp; magnificence of worldly things, rather thē to be caried away with the vertue &amp; truth of euery thing. Two things preſaged vnto him his death, one of his houſes which he had at Baſle was ſmotte with lightning, and another ſumptuouſly builded within his

paſtures, was likewiſe burned with parte of his rareſt and moſt exquiſite moueables: ſhortly after the floure of the houſe wherein he lay, fell all downe at one blowe, and ſodainly: yet nothing happened more grieuous vnto him before his death, then the comming of a man of authoritie out of Baſe Almania to Baſle. For from thenceforth as well aduiſed and forecaſting, hee knewe that by little and little he ſhoulde eaſily be diſcouered. His diſciples were marueilouſly aſtoniſhed at his death, for that he had aſſured them of his immortalitie, yet their hope was ſomewhat vpheld, becauſe he had giuen them to vnderſtande certayne dayes before, howe he ſhoulde take life againe, by the ſpace of three yeeres, and perfect moſt excellent things. Hee kept a porte within his houſe almoſt like a King, in like ſorte was the gouernement of his houſe and caſtle very well ruled. Euerie man had his eſtate and office: their charges and dueties being ſo diſtributed, as he ſhoulde neede to employe no other therein then his owne. In gouerning their common wealth, they obſerued verie ſtraightly 3. things, thereby more and more to conceale their pernitious ſecte. Firſt that none of them once publiſhed the name of Dauid George. Secondly that none reueyled of what condition hee had bene: whereupon it grew that many thought hee had beene yſſued out of ſome great noble Houſe, other that hee was ſome great Marchaunt, which had his factours abroad both by Sea and by land. Thirdly that they ſhoulde not diſcouer ſo much as any one article of their doctrine to any man in Baſle, not ſo much as to a Swizer, nor ſhoulde not endeuour to drawe any man vnto their doctrine: the ſumme whereof was.

            In the yeere 1559. the 5. of March, his children, his ſonnes in lawe, and all them of his familie,Informations, proceedinges, &amp; iudgementes of the Seigneurie of Baſle, vpon the bodie and goods of Dauid George and of the followers of his faith and religion. with ſome other adhering to his Secte, were adiourned before the Senate of Baſle, after information made of that pernicious ſecte, which he had alwayes helde in his life time. The Atturney declared vnto them, howe the Seigneurie ſtoode duely infourmed, that they were retyred to the Caſtle of Buiuignen, not as men perſecuted for the Goſpell, as they had falſly giuen out, but for the ſecte of Dauid, wherewith they had bene alreadie infected. Eleuen were made priſoners to draw out the trueth of the whole. The greater part examined by a more ſtraight inquiſition confeſſed the truth: who in the ende obtayned pardon. Then the firſt day of May, the Miniſters, Rectour, Profeſſors, and Scholemaiſters of Baſle, hauing all with one voyce condemned the pointes of the doctrine, the Senate fully informed of the whole, proceeded the 13. of May to the concluſion of the proces, to wit,
            
               That all his writinges, as full of iniquitie, &amp; mortall poyſon, Item his bodie, or his bones, and whatſoeuer ſhoulde be founde more within his graue, ſhoulde be burned, together with his

picture which they founde in his houſe, repreſenting him verie liuely: and that generally all the goodes of ſo wicked a man, whereſoeuer they were founde, ſhoulde be confiſcate and adiudged to the Seigneurie.
            
            This ſentence was proclaimed according to the Cuſtome of the place, and all the fourme of righte and ordinances of the Towne was kepte in the obſeruation thereof. Before that I handle againe the tearmes of warre, betweene the Frenche and Spanyardes, I will finiſhe, and in fewe wordes, the Empire, and managing of the affayres of Charles of Auſtria the fifte, Emperour of the Almanes.
            About the ende of Auguſt, Charles of Auſtria reſolued to paſſe into Spayne for the occaſions before rehearſed, wente from Bruxelles to Gaunt, the place of his natiuitie, where he aſſembled the 27. of that moneth, all the Embaſſadours one after an other, reſiant about his Perſon, within his chamber,The ſpeech which Charles of Auſtria vſed to the Embaſſadors reſiante about his perſon▪ when as he lefte Flaunders to retourne into Spayne, there to finiſh his dayes. vſing in generall no other ſpeech vnto them, but of the declaration of his old age &amp; indiſpoſition, praying thē to perfourme all good offices for the repoſe due vnto Chriſtendome: Proteſting to the Nuncio (that is the Popes Embaſſadour,) how all his life long, hee had loued and defended the holy apoſtolike Sea: &amp; to the Venetian, how much hee honored that Seigneurie &amp; common wealth, whoſe libertie, &amp; preſeruation he had all his life long deſired, knowing howe much ſhee nouriſhed, and mainteyned the repoſe of Italie. That his Sonne ſhoulde followe him therein, hauing lefte it as an expreſſe, nay teſtamentarie commaundement vnto him. To them of Ferrara and Mantoue hee ſpake in generall, but ſomewhat more particularly to the Florentine, charging him to write vnto his Maiſter, that he ſhoulde neuer lende his care to any newe practiſes againſt his houſe, nor paſſe nothing without aduertiſing of his Sonne, as hee had verye well done, vntill that preſent, and whereby he thought hee tooke no harme, as it appeared. Hereupon, the Embaſſadour, who was a Biſhoppe, woulde haue diſſwaded his departure, and ſhewed him, howe his moſt affectionate friendes were much aſtonied, conſidering eſpecially that all reaſons, and good diſcourſe, were cleane contrary to ſuch a reſolution. And that in ſtead of goyng into Spayne, he were better drawe vp into Italie, or at the leaſt not abandon his Sonne, whome he mought aſſiſt with his good counſayle. To whom aunſwearing, that he could not imagine an olde Prince, euill diſpoſed, and afflicted in all partes as he was, was able to doe as a young Prince, whome he lefte ſo well inſtructed, and in ſo good a will to ſhewe himſelfe great, and a man of warre if hee were vrged thereto: and that it ſhoulde be well knowne, howe his abſence ſhoulde no whitte at all preiudice his friendes. The Biſhoppe woulde haue replyed vpon the affaires and greatneſſe of this worlde, but he interrupted him, praying him to thinke, that his thoughtes were no longer enter commoners with the worlde, to which he badde farewell, and to him likewiſe, and ſo they departed. After hee was at Sail fiue Leagues from Gaunte, where his Sonne gaue him the laſt adieu. Himſelfe goyng downe the riuer to embarque at Vliſhing in Zelande, whither the Queenes Allenor, and Marye his Siſters followed him, vntill he was embarqued. Then Philip made his retourne to Gaunte, where the multitude of affayres beganne to ſolicite his brayne, eſpecially in the expedition of them, in the remarke of humane actions, in the choiſe, and recompence of his ſeruauntes, whome hee choſe and cheriſhed, after another maner of faſhion then his Father. But I muſt agayne handle the enterpriſe of the Frenche vpon Italie, in fauour of Pope Iulye, whoſe diſſeins and conducte the better to open vnto you, I am content to reſearch the affayres of Piemont, where they paſſed ſomewhat in a higher kinde.
            
               
               The meanes which the K. vſed to make the D. of Guiſes armie to paſſe into Italy to the ſuccour of the Pope.To fauour the paſſage of the Duke of Guiſes armie, the King had alreadie commaunded the Mareſchal Briſſac, who was but a little before come out of Piemont to the Courte, (where de Termes commaunded in his abſence) to returne thither agayne, and make readie another armie, the better to ſecond the Dukes in Romaigne, and aſſay to make ſome other exployts for the ſeruice of his Maieſtie, with promeſſe that he ſhoulde not be farre gonne on his iourney before money ſhoulde bee ſente him, as well to paye the olde bandes of Fraunce and Italye lying in Piemont, as to prepare the newe forces, which was conuenient he ſhoulde adde thereunto. Not ſeeing for all that, the effecte of the prouiſion of the ſayde money to followe, which was promiſed vnto him for the men of warre, pioners, horſe to drawe the artillerie, building of bridges vpon boates, munitions of victualles, and other things neceſſary to the following of an armie, he made many diſpatches and inſtances vnto his Maieſtie, and the Coneſtable, who as then had the Superintendance of all the affayres of the Realme,The breach of Truce begun by the aſſayling of Valence in the Dutchie of Milan but hee coulde onely obtayne a ſlowe and no compleate prouiſion: and leſſe to perfourme any aduauncement of honour to any Captaynes of marke as their ſeruices deſerued. Notwithſtanding about the ende of December, 1556. the Mareſchall made an other recharge to the ſame ende, and likewiſe gaue his Maieſtie to vnderſtande of the reſolution taken betweene the Duke of Guiſe and him, vpon the breach of the Truce, and paſſage of the armie into Italye: which breach began vpon the enterpriſe, as they fantaſied vnto themſelues, of the towne of Valence within the Dutchie of Milan, hauing after many deliberations found this enterpriſe moſt fitte and commodious for the more eaſie paſſage of the Dukes armie. The armie beyng readie in the moneth of Ianuarie, albeit it was not ſuccoured with the aſſignations promiſed, yet not to ſuffer it for default thereof to lye ſtill, the Mareſchal borrowed vpon his owne credite, many groſſe ſummes, and eſpecially of the Duke of Guiſe. Yet all was ſo little to the price of that which was due, as they had much adoe to drawe the olde Italian bandes out of their garriſons, or any of the new french Companyes. Which made the armie more weake then it would haue bene. As the Secretarie Bounin declared, who as well for the effecte, as the reaſons aboueſayde, was expreſly diſpatched: chiefely likewiſe to giue his Maieſtie to vnderſtande, how to the ende the platte countrie of Piemont, mought not be lefte in praye to the garriſons of Aſte, Valſerniere, Foſſan, and Coni, whiles the forces of the Countrie were ſo farre eſloigned off, it was thought fitte to make a Leuie of 3000. foote, and 200. light horſe, which ſhoulde lye diſperſed about the Imperiall garriſons, and the money for their payment leuyed vpon the Countrie. Whereto thoſe which were choſen made great difficultie to conſente, yet all was well executed in the ende. And the 14. of Februarie, S Foy had the charge giuen vnto him of 5. Companies of Piemont, and 100. light horſe, and the reſt of the ſaid Leuies, were from hand to hand diſtributed rounde about theſe Garriſons. The which cauſed great ſuertie, commoditie and ſuccour to his Maieſties affayres. Then according to the reſolution taken vpon the breache of Truce,The order which the Mareſchal Briſſac gaue in Piemont. the two armies marched towardes Valence, which they aſſayled the 12. day of Ianuarie. So as after the Batterie had bene layed vnto it, the 14. of that moneth, the Gouernour rendred it vp, vpon the occaſions before ſayde. This done, they helde a Counſell to aduiſe, vpon what ſhoulde be neceſſarye as well for the paſſage of the D. of Guiſe, as the reſt of the affayres concerning the K. ſeruice. To whome among other particulars it was propoſed by the Mareſchall, that his Maieſties intente being to ſuccour the Pope, it was beſt to bethinke of the propieſt and moſt eaſieſt meanes to execute his Commaundemente, and increaſe his authoritie

in Italie. Which as then was verie eaſie, the enemies and eſpecially the Inhabitantes of Milan being in ſuch fright and feare, as ſtanding very tickle within the Towne,Enterpriſe of Milan. which was abandoned by a great nomber of men, ſeeing the greater parte without any Fortreſſe, it was very eaſie for the Duke taking that way, to enter in: Iointe that there were no forces to hinder him, or which durſt oppoſe themſelues againſt him. That being Maiſter of the Towne, he ſhoulde be conſequently of the whole Eſtate, hauing power to commaunde there with ſuch authoritie, as in fewe dayes he ſhoulde haue meanes to finiſhe what remained therein to be fortified with earth and faggots, to cutte off and couer the ſaide Towne from the Caſtle. To fauour which enterpriſe, and occaſion more buſineſſe vnto the enemies, the Mareſchal offered to goe beſiege ſome little towne there, if he founde any facilitie at all to eſſay with, the Artillerie to carrie it away, and that in the meane time Saluoiſin Gouernour of Caſal, ſhoulde goe at a day agreed vpon betweene the Generals attempte, with the ſouldiers of the Garriſon, the execution of the enterpriſe which he had vpon the Towne of Alexandria, of the places of moſt importaunce of the ſtate of Milan. Whereof there coulde no other then a good yſſue bee expected, as well by the intelligence which one gaue from thence vnto the Counſell, &amp; whom the Captaine Saluoiſins Secretarie expreſly went to fetch for that purpoſe, as that Saluoiſin had him ſelfe taken a view of the place. And to the ende that Saluoiſin mought the better keepe it being taken, the Mareſchall promiſed to come thither on the morrowe after the execution thereof with his whole armie: as well to asſiſt Saluoiſin, as to prouide for whatſoeuer ſhoulde be necesſarie for the asſuraunce, and conſeruation of the place, and that ſhortelie after he woulde marche to Milan, to giue order with the Duke of Guiſe for the getting of the Caſtle, and for ſuch affayres as concerned the Kinges ſeruice: and ſo to make the State aſſured vnto his Maieſtie. Thorough the conſideration whereof it was not to be doubted, but the Duke of Alua with the forces which hee had in Romagne, woulde leaue the Countrie to come ſuccour the reſt of that Eſtate: as a matter of greater importaunce vnto his Maiſter, then the quarrell of the Pope. Who notwithſtanding ſhoulde by this meanes haue the ſuccoures which he deſired, without hazzarding an armie in ſuch daungers as mought fall out in ſo long voyages, and to which all ſuch as haue heretofore paſſed thorowe Italie in fauour of the Popes, haue for the moſt parte beene ſubiecte. Thus ſhoulde the will of his Maieſtie be perfourmed, with the Conqueſt of an whole Eſtate, for which,What ſucceſſe the French armies haue had in Italie, eſpecially in the conqueſt of the Realme of Naples. Warre had beene ſo long time made in the Houſe of Fraunce. Furthermore the hope and apparaunce which was there to gayne the whole, or at the leaſt a great parte of the Seigneurie of Genes, yea by the inhabitauntes owne good will, thorough the necesſitie of Victualles, into which they were brought. Prouided that his Maieſtie, to whome a diſpatche for that ende ſhoulde be ſente, woulde commaunde the Galleyes of Marſeilles to ſcowre the Seas, and to keepe the Coaſt of Sicilie in ſubiection, to keepe the Genowaies from beeing that wayes any more ſuccoured with Corne, then they ſhoulde bee out of Piemont. And indeede the dearthe was there ſo great, for the ſmall time which they were in the Duchie of Milan, and thourough the taking of Valence, as that a ſacke of Corne was worth tenne Crownes. The propoſitions being at large debated of, were in the ende founde ſo good, and accompanyed with ſo apparaunt reaſons, as the moſt parte of them which were of the Counſell, ſeeing the importaunce of ſuch Eſtates, as thoſe of Milan and of Genes, which made a way vnto his Maieſtie to encreaſe his power and authoritie in Italie, Iointe the vncertaine and ſo variable occurrents, as

mought befall an Armie, in ſo long a voyage, and by ſuch an enemie ſo readie and reſolute, were of opinion, that they were to bee hearkened vnto, and that his Maieſtie ſhoulde with all dilligence be aduertiſed thereof. But the Duke of Guiſe hauing an other intent of greater importaunce, tolde them that hee had receyued Commaundement from the King to proceede onwardes and not to ſtay: An occaſion that many haue ſince depraued this his aduiſe, eſpecially after the ende of his enterpriſe.
            But Lautrec in the like accidente, conducting the Frenche armie, for the taking of Naples, after the deliuerie of Frauncis the firſt, allied with the Potentates of Italie, 1527. hauing taken the Towne of Boſco, Alexandria, Vigeneue, Pauia, and other places, as it was deliberated in Counſell, whether they ſhoulde ſtaye vppon the Conqueſt of Milan, (to which they which helde the Frenche partie beſought him to employe his men, conſidering the reſolution of them, and the fright of their enemies,) or paſſe forwardes, aunſwered that hee had commaundement to ſeeke further, and that he was principally ſent into Italie, for the deliuerie of Pope Clement.
            
            True it is, that ſome thought Lautrec tooke this reſolution, fearing leaſt if they ſhoulde conquerre the Dutchie of Milan, the Venetians being confederate with the Frenche, woulde bee careleſſe to ſuccour the King in the Conqueſte of Naples. And it is poſſible likewiſe that the King thought, it woulde be better for him that Frauncis Sforze mought not entirely recouer this Eſtate, to the ende that no power remayning vnto him to bee able to vndertake ought, hee mought the more eaſilye obtayne the deliueraunce of his children, as yet the Emperours priſoners, by waye of accorde, which continually was treated of, about the Emperour, by the Embaſſadours of Fraunce, Englande, and Veniſe.
            Thus then the D. of Guiſe reſolued vpon his firſt aduiſe, cauſed a bridge of boates to be made at Baſignaue ouer the riuer Tauaro, where his armie ſeconded with the Mareſchal Briſſacs, paſſed ouer to perfourme the voyage of Italie. And to the ende that it mought bee done with more ſuretie, and that hee mought auoyde the meeting of the forces which the Marqueſſe of Peſcarie cauſed in all dilligence to bee aſſembled, thereby to cutte him off from his paſſage, the Mareſchal entered within Laumeline, with a countenaunce as though he would marche towardes Milan: An occaſion that the Marqueſſe turned bridle ſuddainely towardes Milan, with the fewe forces which hee had, ſuffering the Duke of Guiſe freely to paſſe, and his armie, whither it liked him beſt.
            Vpon whoſe Ariuall, the Duke of Alua, for wante of money, and to ſuffer the firſt furie of the Frenche to coole, leuyed his ſiege from Rome, and retired vpon the borders of the Kingdome of Naples, there to defende the Frontiers from the diſſeins of the Frenche.
            As for the Duke of Florence, he to keepe his dependances from waſte, and ſpoile of the enemie, and likewiſe to get leyſure to goe on with his Fortreſſes, lent his eare to ſome alliaunce with the King. But fortified as he was, hee retyred within his Towne. In ſuch ſorte, as Pierre Stroſſi Mareſchal of Fraunce, being departed one of the firſt, and encloſed himſelfe within Rome, with a nomber of French and Italians, had alreadie vnder the fauour of the Dukes comming, combated, and taken certayne Fortes and Blockehouſes, builded by the Imperialles rounde about the Towne, and vpon the Tiber: ſo as the Pope was before the ariuall of the Frenche, as it were, reſtored into full libertie, and Rome aſſured of her enemies.
            
               I will ſhewe you by and by what the Duke did as ſoone as he was approched vnto the capitall Citie of Italie, againſt the diſſeins of his enemies, who prepared thē
               ſelues to all euentes, and in ſundrie places.
            Nowe, albeit there was no talke of any warre in Fraunce, but onely by murmurs, and particular preſages, more then any publique declarations,Warre begunne in Fraunce againſt the Truce. many preſumed that the warre of Italie woulde giue a beginning to that of Fraunce, yet the bruite being giuen out, howe the Arthois and Henaute Garriſons were reenforced to make a checke vpon ſome of the Frontiers, the Admirall Gouernour of Picardie, thinking to playe with the cunningeſt, meant to preuent them, and firſt of all, himſelfe to breake the Truce in Picardie. In ſuch ſorte, as about the beginning of Ianuarie. 1557. hauing ambuſhte himſelfe neare Douay, hee had entred in, in the night, while the moſt parte of the Garriſon was droncke, with drinking and crying the king drinkes, had not an olde woman by her long and lowde cryinges out, of Arme, Arme, the Frenche, giuen in the ende the Alarme thorough out, hauing ſoone ynough diſcouered ſome indiſcreete perſons among the formoſt of the French. But being retourned to Lans in Arthois, and entered within,The Admirall breaketh the Truce in Fraunce. he ſuffered it to be ſo pilled, as the Imperialles for a long time reproached thoſe cruelties to the Frenche: beſides that they alleadged the taking thereof, among the firſt occaſions of the breache of Truce.
            You ſee then on this and that ſide, the Spanyarde and Frenche diſpoſed to warre, ſeeking all meanes to ruyne them ſelues more furiouſly then euer. Nowe for that the broyles in Piemont, as the firſt ſeeme to mee more remarkeable, Iointe that certaine monethes paſſed ouer in Fraunce, and the Countries bordering about, in the preparations of a future warre, without any other more notable effectes then aboue rehearſed, I will remember againe the Mareſchall Briſſac, to ſhewe you, howe hauing taken the Imperialles at vnawares, he purſued the poynte of his aduauntages.
            After the departure of the Duke of Guiſe and his armie, the Mareſchall gaue himſelfe to fortifie and munition Valence with all that was neceſſarie: abiding notwithſtanding, a certaine time in Lomline, to holde the Generall of the Imperialles in ſuſpence of his diſſeins. And had vndertaken matters of greater importaunce, had money beene in his handes to contente his people, and furniſhe out ſuch thinges as were needefull for him. But for want thereof, reſolued to retire himſelfe, and keepe his aduantages, hee furniſhed Caſal, Montcalue, Valence, and Santia, each of them with ten Enſeignes of Fanterie, and ſome Cauallerie, againſt the enterpriſes of the Marqueſſe, whoſe Forces grewe greater to the diminution of the French, for the occaſions aboueſayde. And albeit that the want of money, and the cutting off alreadie made by the King of certaine Companies of Piemont, as well in nomber as in paye, were ſufficient occaſions to hinder the Eſtate of his affayres in that Countrey, he ſente vnto the Mareſchall notwithſtanding about the ende of Februarie, that in any ſorte ſoeuer, hee ſhoulde not meddle with the dead payes. And that euery moneth he ſhoulde ſend him an accounte, to the ende he mought aſſigne warrant for money to the Treaſourer of the extraordinarie: without any whitte regarding howe nothing hauing bene ſente for the artillerie carriages, Pioners, munitions, commiſſaries, and matters vnlooked for, the Mareſchall ſaide hee was fayne to helpe himſelfe with thoſe dead paies. So as founding vpon ſuch defaults the ſmal aduancement which he made in Piemont, &amp; ſeeing how he preached to a deafe eare, hee beſought but in vaine his Maieſtie, about the moneth of May, to ſende ſome

Gentleman vnto him, to controle his actions, to the ende that no euill mought bee preſumed of him. This notwithſtanding, albeit that hee durſte not muſter his armie, for feare of mutinies, thorough wante of paye, and that he was reſolued not to remayne ydle, hee employed his credite to recouer a ſumme of money, to make a loane vnto the companyes of Fanterie, attending the Kinges money. And hauing thus made them to goe into the fielde, hee ledde them, for the execution of the Counſell, to batter, and take in parley, the 22. of Aprill, Valeſerniere, notwithſtanding the great and continuall raynes, all the while that the ſiege endured. A Towne which waſted all Piemont, and ſcowred the way from Aſt, to Cony, Queras, and Emeraſt: and Queras being with the ſelfe ſame furie, beſieged, battered, and ſuddainely aſſayled, was taken by force the 29. of Aprill, the fourth day of the ſiege. Whereupon to encreaſe this fire of good will, and make the poore ſouldier to liue, more vpon the expence of the enemie, then of the allie, the ſiege of Cony was reſolued vpon and begonne in the ſame moneth. Whether the K. ſent money, which very little exceeded the only pay of the Zwizers. The Mareſchall notwithſtanding appointed muſtars to be taken, of the French and Italian Fanterie. But as ſoone as the ſouldiers knewe, that they woulde giue but a crowne a piece to a man, and that by the handes of the Treaſourer, the ſouldiers were not ſlacke to mutinie, and goe away in great Troupes, conſidering their long ſeruices, which had neuer beene acknowledged, and the newe faſhion of paying them, by other mens hands then their Captaines: who ſhewing themſelues no leſſe grieued, and reſting the beholders of ſuch inſolencies, without ſtirring to puniſh any, they made the Mareſchal goe himſelfe to procure them to returne backe, and aſſure them that the money ſhould be deliuered vnto their Captaines, to diſtribute as they were accuſtomed. And albeit that ſo little money did not much content them, yet the ſiege was continued. In which the Mareſchall ſeeing that the batterie wrought no great effecte, and yet they which were beſieged, ſhewed a countenaunce as if they woulde yeelde if they were luſtily purſued, it was agreed that a myne ſhoulde bee made, right againſt the Batterie. Wherein they wrought long with daunger and difficultie notwithſtanding. But in in the ende being finiſhed, well cloſed, and ſealed vp, the fire put, and the aſſaulte giuen by the ruyne which it had lefte, the order eſtabliſhed for the aſſaulte was ſo euill kepte, and beſides the Souldiars wente ſo ſlackely to worke, as the Maiſter of the Campe being ſlayne, and a nomber of Gentlemen and Souldiers, who were the firſt which aduaunced formoſt, being dead on the earth, and the reſt beaten backe with the hurte of many gallaunt men, the euente ſhewed howe of an armie euill ſatiſfied, full of Captaynes and Souldiers diſcontented and diſobedient, no other ſucceſſe ought to be hoped for then vnfortunate.
            In the meane time the Mareſchall ſente to declare vnto the King, together with the neceſſities of his armie, and the feare leaſt all woulde turne to ruyne for him, the inſtance which the Duke of Ferrara made, to cauſe the French armie to approache to the Dutchie of Milan, to the ende to helpe it with his forces and diſſeins: and likewiſe the impoſſibilitie of beeing able to ſatiſfie it, without paying at leaſt the Fanterie.
            Not long after, the Mareſchall hauing receyued newes, howe the Marqueſſe of Peſcare was ariued at Foſſan, with ſome forces in intention to approch neare Cony, to fauour them within, or aſſaye to compell the ſiege to be rayſed, a Counſell was helde, and reſolued to abandon Cony, to martch right towardes the Marqueſſe. But as ſoone as hee perceyued the Mareſchall to approache, he retired into Foſſan,

to the which the Frenche ſtill approached. By meanes whereof the Marqueſſe fearing to bee encloſed there, conſequently himſelfe to reduce this place to extreame neceſſitie, he wrought ſo well, as with the whole Infanterie he gayned Cony: But from thence not knowing howe to returne, he was conſtrayned to leade his men a trauerſe the mountaines to gayne the Sea ſhoare, and ſaue his people as well as hee mought. The difficultie of the wayes notwithſtanding was founde ſuch, as he loſt many of his people, and they which ſaued themſelues, ſo wearie, and defeated, as it was not posſible to bee more. As for his men at armes, and his Cauallerie, they remayned ſtill within Foſſan. Therefore it was agreed, that waſte ſhoulde bee made there round about. And further that Forces ſhould be layed all a longeſt the paſſages and wayes, that none of the Cauallerie mought eſcape.
            During the time that it was thus encloſed, many fayre feates, and notable ſkirmiſhes were vndertaken, and diuerſly executed: Namely by the Vidaſme of Chartres, Colonell of the Fanterie of Piemont, D'Anuille de Terrides, and others, with ſo good watche kept all alongeſt the pasſages, as many Troupes of this Cauallerie, which was no leſſe then betweene one thouſande and twelue hundred horſe, were entrapped and defeated. The Frenche in the meane ſpace, entertayned the ſiege before Cony, and many Gentlemen and Captaynes trauayled, who ſhoulde be marked to worke moſt to the damage of the beſieged. Among the reſt, woorde was ſente vnto the King of the feates done by the Vidaſme, ſince the rayſing of the ſiege. Eſpecially in the breaking vp of milles, which had bene repayred by them of the Towne, blocked with a nomber of Fortes, which marueilouſly annoyed him. And likewiſe the happie enterpriſes atchieued about Foſſan, by De Termes, Gonor, D'Anuille, and other, who gaue ſo ſmall reſte to their Troupes of Cauallerie, eſpecially their light horſe, whoſe courſings out were more ordinarie, &amp; remarkeable, as all thought they had yeilded occaſions enough vnto his Maieſtie, to be well and ſufficiently requited, for ſo well perfourming of their duetie.
            You ſhall ſee howe, and wherefore the meanes wanted vnto their Prince rather then the will, through the accidents, which leſſe fortunate in other places of Fraunce then in Piemont, happened at the ſame time, to counterpeaſe the Mareſchals good fortune by the diſgrace of his Coneſtable, as I will make you to perceyue, if you well and dilligently marke all the notable particularities, which I will deduce vpon ſuch and ſo important an occurrence. For it is leſſe then nothing to knowe the inconuenience of the iourney of Saint Quentins: That is knowne as well to fooles as wiſe men, younge, and olde, men and women, homebirdes and ſtraungers, friendes &amp; enemies. But to applie it to ones profite, to the ſuretie, and aduauncement of the State, one muſt vnderſtande the beginning and true motiue: dilligently, and with affection marke the meanes as well forced as voluntarie, by which this disfauour happened: then note the effectes of them, and in the ende conſider the good and the badde, which hath enſewed vnto Fraunce, and the Countreyes aboute, vnder the obedience of theſe two Princes. This is called to reaſon of, and to reade Hiſtories as it appertayneth. The which I will doe, hauing repreſented vnto you the deportement of the Duke of Guiſe, and his Armie in Italie.
            From Plaiſantin the Duke of Guiſe went to Regge, a Towne which appertained to the D. of Ferrara his father in law, who mette him at Pont de Leuz, &amp; all in company, with the Cardinall Caraffe, ſente thither by the Pope entered within Regge, where they conſulted of the diſſein, meanes, &amp; conduct of this warre. Some would

haue gone into Lombardie to attempt the getting of Cremone and Pauia, whileſt that Briſſac dyd his dutie vpon that ſide of Nouarre and Valence. Other who conſidered that in ſo dooing they ſhould giue leaſure to the Duke of Alua to fortifie himſelfe, and to make a leauie of men, as well within the kingdome of Naples as Tuſcane, without forcing for all that, any one of thoſe Townes furniſhed with all thinges neceſſarie, were of opinion that they ſhould ruſh vpon Tuſcane to deliuer Siene out of the Florentines and Spaniardes handes. The Cardinall Caraffe founde it moſt aduantagious to aſſayle the kingdome of Naples, by the March of Ancone (the territorie of the ancient Picentines) ſaying that on that ſide of Terre de Labour, hee might conquere as much of the Countrie as ſeemed good vnto him. But the Duke of Ferrara maintained, that the Duke of Guiſe being come for the cauſe of his holyneſſe, he ought likewiſe to go ſtraight on to Rome, and imploy himſelfe to the defence of the Pope. And that afterwardes the reſt ſhould bee thought of. That in the meane time hee would keepe himſelfe with his forces in his owne Countries, foraſmuch as he truſted not the Duke of Parma his neighbour,D. of Ferrara at Veniſe and why hauing entered into league with king Phillip: and that he feared beſides leaſt the Florentine would make roades into his lands, if hee eſloigned himſelfe.Corregge taken by the Spaniards vpon the D. of Ferrara. So as according to this aduiſe the Duke of Guiſe marched with Caraffe towardes Bologne, and the Duke of Ferrara leauing the Prince Alphonce his ſonne for his lieutenant, went to Veniſe to aunſwere the Embaſſadour of Spaine, who made there grieuous complaintes againſt him, blaming the Pope, and King Henrye to make warre vniuſtly againſt his Maiſter, and to breake the truce ſo neceſſarie to Chriſtendome: beſeeching the Seigneurie to make warre againſt the Ferrarois, and to enter into league with the Catholique King. Now as the Duke of Ferrara ſoiorned at Veniſe, the Marqueſſe of Peſcare ſeaſed vppon the Towne of Corregge,The French army in Italie. whence ſprange the firſt beginning of the war in the Countrie of Ferrara. An occaſion, that the Duke leauing Veniſe returned into his owne lands, to fortifie Modene, Carpi, and other places of his Seigneuries: whileſt that the Duke of Guiſe at Bologne, complayned to the Popes miniſters, howe he ſawe no ſuch preparation of warre, as had bene promiſed vnto the King. But they contented him, when they tolde him that there were tenne thouſand men in the March d'Ancone. And hauing paſſed by Imole, Rauenne, Faenze, &amp; Ceſene, he came to Rimini, where he viewed, and muſtered his Troupes, which he found to amount vnto fiue thouſande Swizers, ouer which the Marqueſſe d'Albauf his brother commaunded: foure thouſand Griſons, ſeauen thouſand French, and Gaſcoignes, ſome Italians, fiue hundred and fiftie men at armes, and fifteene hundred light horſe. Ouer the Fanterie commaunded the Duke of Neuers. Cipierre was Maiſter of the Campe. Tauannes, and La Motte Gondrin, were Mareſchalles of the Campe. On the other ſide the Mareſchall Briſſac comming out with his Forces into the fielde, cauſed Valle-Feniere to bee beſieged, a ſtrong place ſcituate betweene Aſt, and Carmignolle, which he enforced to yeild by compoſition, for the want of victuals which the Spanyardes had that helde it: afterwardes it was ruyned topſie toruie. This done, hee made Chiauaſſe to be aſſailed, a Caſtle ſcituate in a high place, and bordering vpon Vlpian, which hee carryed away, albeit it was furniſhed with all thinges neceſſarie, and there he put in a ſtrong Garriſon to keepe it. While theſe thinges were a doing, the Duke of Alua cauſed his Armie to turne head,D. of Alua in the Kingdome of Naples. as though hee meante to goe to the Kingdome of Naples to defende it, imagining that the Duke of Guiſe woulde martche thither. Then hee furniſhed, &amp; fortified the townes of Arbuzze, a countrie neighbouring to the march

of Acone, and in the meane ſpace the Duke of Guiſe tooke Campilio, and beſieged Ciuitelle, ſcituate vpon the Tiber on Tuſcane ſide, mounted vppon a high hillocke, hauing a rocke for the foundation of the wals, and of a moſt harde acceſſe vnto it. So as nature ſeruing it for a rampire, it ſeemed almoſt impregnable, thorough the greate ſteepes of her moſt deepe valleyes, all alongeſt which runneth the riuer Viperate. An occaſion that it laie not in the power of the French to inforce it, but they were fayne to leauie the ſiege after they had loſt many good ſouldyers and valyant men. Lykewiſe little dyd the Marſhall of Briſſac gayne at the ſame time by the ſiege of Conie: For albeit that he had battered day and night this place appertayning to the Duke of Sauoy, yet hee was faine to leaue it in the end, for the ſuccour which the Marqueſſe of Peſcare had brought thether. Now albeit the Duke of Guiſe aduaunced lyttle before Ciuitelle, the Duke of Alua notwythſtanding came to leauie the ſiege.Ciuitelle reſcued from the French. So as hauing ſent certaine troupes vnder the charge of Garſie de Toledo, and Countie de Pepoly, to ſee what countenance the French made, they were ſo roughly reencountered, as Garſie beeing defeated, and his troupes put in rout, Pierre Henriques maſter of the Duke of Alua his campe, was there taken, and almoſt all the Spaniardes cut in peeces, by the Vidaſme of Chartres, Tauannes, Cipierre, and others. Afterwardes the French beeing conſtrayned to leaue the place for the reaſons aboueſayde, were drawen to Mont-fort by the inhabitants, who ſaying they were not able to ſupporte the inſolencie of the Spaniardes, woulde not bee reduced vnder the obedience of the Pope. But they coulde not yeelde the towne, which was the cauſe that the Duke de Palliane hauing battered it and ſcaled it, carryed it awaye by aſſault. The Spaniardes beeing retyred by another place of the Towne, and ſo the Citizens bare theyr pennance, beeing well pilled, theyr towne burned, and halfe ruined. Afterwardes the Duke of Palliane, and the Marſhall Strozzie ioyned both theyr forces with the Duke of Guiſes. Who ſeeing that what the Popes Legates and Nounces promiſed vnto the King, was but winde without effect, and that there was no meanes to increaſe his forces in Italie, as the Duke of Alua dyd his ordinarily: hee wrote vnto the King, giuing him to vnderſtand, that wythout newe ſuccours it was vnpoſsible for him to aduance his deſſeine, conſidering his enemyes forces, and the ſmall fauour which hee founde in thoſe quarters. Some haue left in writing, that that which moued the Duke of Guiſe to write in that manner vnto the King, was for that he was aduertiſed, how Codognac the kings Embaſſador at Conſtantinople, was diſmiſſed of his charge, and La Vigne put into his place. And as hee attended one hundred Turkiſh Gallyes which were promiſed by Soliman to Codognac for his ſuccours, hee receyued intelligence how the Turke had chaunged his mind, through ſome too high words vttered by La Vigne. Others ſaie that it was thorough the practiſe of ſome French men, enemies to La Vigne. In ſuch ſorte as the Kinges ſeruice was thus retarded in Italie, for occaſions ſlight inough. Natalis Countie of Nuouolare, confeſſed that the Turke woulde not ſtirre one whit in this buſineſſe for the king in Italy, for that hee ſawe no profite redound to himſelfe. Ioynt that hee doubted leaſt the Chriſtians agreeing together woulde ſeeke to diminiſhe his forces, and afterwardes make ſome attempt agaynſt him. And in deede thoſe which were in Corſe at ſuch time as Dragut-Rais brought thether the Turkes ſuccours, knowe that when the French beſieged Calui, as the Turkes had demaunded the firſt point of the aſſaulte, ſeeing themſelues cruelly and bloudily cut in peeces, they beganne to ſuſpect and miſtruſte the Chriſtians, to ſee howe the Spaniardes and the Frenchmen made

warre the more gently one vpon another. And Iorden Vrſin had inough to do to content them, and to pul out that hard impreſsion which they had conceiued againſt the French.
            The Duke of Guiſe in ſumme, ſeeing howe on all partes the effectes fayled of ſo rich promiſes as had beene made vnto his maſter, and confirmed vnto him ſince his comming into Italy. Ioyne that the forces of the Spaniſh Duke beganne to growe greater, and increaſe in courage, by the aduertiſement which they had of the neceſſities of the French, before that his owne were too much diminiſhed, and the aduantage too euidently turned elſewhere, reſolued to put it to the hazarde of one daie. Therefore ſeeing himſelfe neere enough vnto the Duke of Alua his campe, he preſented battell vnto him betweene Fermie and Aſcolye. To which the Spaniarde woulde not hearken: Were it that hee found himſelfe too weake, or that he thought by delaie hee might better ſerue his turne. In the meane time King Phillip had no ſooner made the aduauntage of his armie to appeare in Picardie, but the King ſent to the Duke of Guiſe,The Pope retaineth the d. of Guiſe that hee ſhoulde retire home. Who ſeeing that all the burthen of the warre lighted on the Kings armes, and that it was ſo farre of from the Popes furniſhing of twentie thouſand men, as hee had promiſed, that hee was not able to paie ſixe thouſand, nor disburſe the fourth parte of the charge of the armie. Ioynte that the Ferrarois were ſo farre from ſuccouring the Pope or the King, as the Duke of Guiſe was faine to ayde him with ſome of his men, fearing beſides leaſt the Pope woulde make a peace wythout comprehending the King therein, concluded to returne into France. But the Pope fearing to bee lefte alone, and leaſt hee ſhould be afterwardes compelled to accord at the will and diſcretion of the Spaniard, ſware vnto him that hee woulde neuer agree wythout the Kinges aduiſe and conſent thereto: and how for the better aſſurance thereof hee woulde ſende his ſonne the Duke of Palliane, as hoſtage into Fraunce. So as this ſo large an offer retayned the French longer, during whoſe vaine aboade there happened the defeate of Saint Quentin in Permandois. Which beeing knowen at Rome, ſo greatly aſtonied the Pope, as ſeeing himſelfe out of all hope to haue anie further ſuccour out of Fraunce, hee reſolued to followe the counſell of ſundrie Cardinalles, which verie earneſtly ſolicited him to make a peace with the Spaniarde. Who in the meane time determined to plant agayne the ſiege before Rome: not that hee was in anie hope to take it, but onely to inforce the Pope to a peace, which hee knew was greatly deſired by the Catholike king. But the Duke of Guiſe vnderſtanding this deſſeine, and the effects thereof, fayled not to approach vnto Tiuoli, a place ſcituated vppon the Teueron, to front the enemie, and to inforce him to leauie his ſiege. The which was the cauſe that by all the meanes they poſsiblie coulde, they haſtned the treatie of the peace ſought by the Venetians, and the Duke of Florence. The Pope ſending on the eight of September in his name, the Cardinalles Carlo Caraffe, Saint Fior, and Vitolloce, with ſome Romane Lordes towardes the Duke of Alua, who as then laie at Canie, a place ſcituate in the Romane Countrie, neere to Pilaſtrine, to conferre of the whole.
            
               Peace negotiated, and by whom.Betweene whome it was concluded and agreed, that the Duke of Alua and the Cardinall Caraffe woulde reſolue thereof together at Beneſſan, which is not farre from them: hauing each of them ample power and commiſsion from theyr maſter, to determine and conclude of all thinges, according as the Popes Letters carryed for the Cardinall Caraffe, dated the eighth daie of September, 1557. at Rome:

and king Phillips, for Don Ferdinande Aluarez de Toledo, Duke of Alua, dated the fiue and twenteeth of Iuly. In ſumme, the peace was concluded betweene the Pope and the Spaniard, and ſuch were the Articles:Articles of peace between the Pope and the Spaniard. That the Duke of Alua dooing all kinde of obeyſances due, and ſubmiſsions in the name of the king of Spaine his maſter, ſhould beſeech pardon of the Popes holyneſſe: That hee ſhoulde receiue him as his good and obedient ſonne, participating vnto him ſuch graces as were common to other: That king Phillip ſhoulde doo the lyke, by an Embaſsadour expreſly ſent from him to Rome: That the Pope as a mercifull and debonarie Father, ſhoulde receiue the Catholique king as his ſonne, and giue vnto him all ſuch graces as hee was wont to doo, and accorde to other Chriſtian kings: That his holyneſſe ſhoulde renounce the league with the French king, and declare himſelfe a father to the one and the other of both the kinges, wythout anie one more than the other: That the Catholique King ſhoulde render vp all the townes, places, caſtles, and fortreſſes, beeing of the domaine of the Church, which had bene taken ſince the ouerture of this warre. Hee ſhoulde make bee builded agayne and repayred, all ſuch as had beene ruined and diſmembred by the Spaniardes: That all the artillerie taken on the one ſide or the other, in what ſorte ſo euer, ſhoulde bee reſtored againe into the handes of his auncient poſſeſſour: That they ſhoulde forget all ſuch executions as had ben done by iuſtice during this warre, were it by death or banniſhment: and all confiſcations of what perſons whatſoeuer, wythout anie mannes reſearching after into them. As alſo all ſuch as thorough this diſſention were driuen out of theyr landes, goods, and dignities, ſhoulde bee reſtored into theyr good renowme, goods, honours, ſtates, and dignities, right actions, and Seignouries. Prouided that they had loſt theſe thinges by meanes of this warre, to the ende this peace might not bee auaileable to Marke Anthonie Colone, nor to Aſcaigne de la Corne, but that they ſhoulde remayne outlawed, at the will and diſcretion of the holy Father. That the Dutchie of Palliane ſhould bee put in ſuch eſtate as it was then, by the conſent and good liking of both partyes, into the hands of Iean Barnardin Carbon, which was the ſequeſtrer, who ſhould ſweare to the Pope and the Catholique King, to keepe faith to both parties, and obſerue the articles and agreements made and accorded betweene the Duke of Alua and the Cardinall Caraffe. Which Carbon was to haue the keeping of the Towne of Palliane, hauing vnder him eight hundred ſouldyers, payed by the Pope and the Catholique king.
            Theſe Articles were ſworne to in the name of the ſayde Princes, the Pope, and king Phillip, by the Cardinall Caraffe and the Duke of Alua, according to the Commiſsion and faculties giuen vnto them, ſwearing by the ſoules of theyr Princes, to obſerue all the whole without fraude, cauelling, or anie exception whatſoeuer: adding a truce for a certayne time, contayning paſport and ſafeconduct to the Duke of Guiſe, and to all the Captaines and ſouldyers of the king of France, to departe out of Italie, and the Countries appertayning vnto king Phillip, as well by ſea as by land. Afterwardes they ſigned and ſealed the whole in the preſence of the Cardinals of S. Flour, and Vitelle, who lykewiſe ſigned the preſent Treatiſe. And forſomuch as it was not ſet downe therein to whome Palian ſhoulde appertaine, ſince that the ſequeſtrer kept it in the name of both the princes contracting, there were ſecrete articles agreed vpon between the Cardinal Caraffe and the Duke of Alua. In which it was contained, how that it ſhould remaine at the will and diſcretion of the catholike king, either to ruine or leaue that place in her entire, without being lawful for him to repair

or fortifie it, vntill the ſayd Lord King had giuen ſome place of like value and reuenew to the Popes ſonne for recompence. And anie difference falling out vppon that exchange, the Senate of Venice ſhoulde giue iudgement thereof, wythout either the one or the other parties refuſing to obey what ſhuld be ordayned by that Seignorie. And the recompence beeing once made by king Phillip, hee might then beſtowe the place of Palian vppon whom it liked him beſt, ſauing anie ſuch as were an enemie to the Church of Rome. And that he which ſhould haue Palian in ſequeſtration, ſhould bee bound to depart ſo ſoone as the place were diſmembred. Such was the iſſue of the affayres of Italie, and of the armie which the King ſent for the Popes ſuccour, the which was followed with a ſtrange ouerflowing inundation of Tiber, as I will cauſe you to ſee elſewhere.
            Now that each partie had of a long time turned his deſſeignes to the warre, couered notwithſtanding by the concluſion of this truce, yet had the Spaniſh Councell much better and from longer hande prouided for the preparatiues and inconueniences thereof. For Phillip put as ſoone an armie agaynſt that of Italie (by which he drew out of the realme, the flower of the nobilitie, and the moſt renowmed Captaines and ſouldiers which were there) the moſt accompliſhed and beſt furniſhed with all neceſſaries of anie that had beene ſeene of long time.The deſseines &amp; old preparations of king Phillip. To the end hee would not faile to ſet forward his firſt fortune, which he meant to proue in the view of all the potentates of Europe, eſpecially of the French, in whome hee meant to ingraue by the beginning of his enterpriſes ſuch a dread of his forces &amp; means, as that for euer after they ſhould bee more ſtayed, and leſſe ſtirring againſt him, than they had beene againſt anie of his anceſtors. Henrie on the contrarie (as the French is neuer aduiſed but vpon the blow) prouiding onelye for his armie which marched to affranchiſe the Pope from his enemies,Deſsignes and preparations of king Henrie. (to whom ſuccours was almoſt as ſoone promiſed as demanded) hauing vnderſtood but too late, through want of intelligence the galliard preparatiues of Phillip, found himſelfe no leſſe aſtonied to ſee he was taken at a lifte, than perplexed through the difficultie, whereof reporte was made vnto him, of finding finances to leuie, conduct, furniſh, and imploy ſo groſſe an armie withall. Which to hinder the enterie and ſacke of his realme to ſo puiſſant a neighbour and ancient enemie, was a matter neceſſarie for the richeſt and pooreſt Prince of Chriſtendome, (thorough the abundance, and yet euill husbanding of his meanes) in making readie the preparatiues, whereof hee knew a great deale better the difficulties which preſented themſelues to the executions of his haughtie deſseignes, by the complaintes which all the eſtates of his Realme made to bee reſounded on all partes, as ſoone as the bruite of another warre refreſhed theyr memorie wyth remembrance of ſo many ſorrowes paſſed.
            Two houſes at this time poſſeſſed king Henrie more than anie other of his realme, that of Guiſe and Monmorencie, both of them recommended for the antiquitie, valour, and renowme of their races, vertuouſly imployed to the profite and honour of the crowne of France. But that being the greater, better allied, richer, and of more renowme throughout all Chriſtendome, woulde not acknowledge the Monmorencian equall to itſelfe, ſauing in the fauor of the Prince, whoſe grace towards the Conſtable mounted ſo farre, as that hee would conceale nothing from him, doo all things by his aduiſe, and vouchſafe him ſometimes to bee his bedfellow, the honour and reſpect beeing kept ſtill ſuch as hee ought. So as beeing ſet in authoritie, thorough the credite and exceeding vertue, as well of his foure ſonnes, as of his three nephewes of Chaſtillon, and other his kinſmen, who bare honorable offices, all of them within the

realme, hee ſeemed to haue no need of deſiring the increaſe of ought, but only a continuance of his greatneſſe, prouided that no diſaſter did croſſe the courſe of ſo happie a purſuit. Thoſe of Guiſe no leſſe ſupported by the merite of their owne valour, and put in authoritie thorough the ancient renowme of ſo many princes, iſſued out of the houſe of Lorraine, ſought to make themſelues greateſt in the kings fauour, by a farre greater number of ſignall ſeruices with Charles and Frances of Guiſe, might doo to the flower de Luce. So as, as well to continue their owne dutie, as their aunceſtours and fathers, they had vndertaken the voyage of Italie, to the end to deliuer Pope Iulie out of the Spaniardes handes: and if promiſe ſhould bee kept with them, to imploy them ſelues to the conqueſt of the kingdome of Naples, hoping by that means much more to extoll the kings power &amp; credit among forrain nations▪ 
               Charles and De Guiſe Cardinals remaining onely behinde in Court to entertaine the king to the conduct of ſuch a deſſein. Which lykewiſe was greatly fauoured by Diane de Poitiers, ſole heire to S. Valier, Duke of Valentinois, who to imploie thereto that part of hir credit, which her beautie, comely carriage, and quickneſſe of ſpirite (graces hatefull inough to the vertuous Katherine de Medices Queene of France) had gained vnto her of the king, had giuen one of her daughters in marriage to De Guiſe Earle of Aumaule, who accompanyed the Duke his brother into Italie. Now as all greatneſſe ſtandeth accompanied with the paſsions of the Court, vpon the preparatiues which king Phillip made dayly, to be reuenged of the loſses aboueſayd, men began to ſhew vnto the king the damage and diſhonour, which thorough the abſence of his forces, the breach of truce ſo ſolemnly ſworne would bring vnto him: how the Duke of Guiſe had ſpent one hundred and three ſcore thouſand crownes a moneth, without hauing done ought elſe than ſeene Ciuitelle, a frontire towne of Naples the ſmall, or rather no aduantage at all, which hee had receiued by the breach thereof. How that the king of Spaine beeing well ſetled in his quarters within Italie, had aſſembled together ſuch forces, as it was an eaſie matter for him to aduance the ruine of France, if hee ſhould enter in againſt ſo few people as were to preſent themſelues vnto him, in the ranke of whome, notwithſtanding the Conſtable humblie beſought his maieſtie to place him, that hee might imploie therein, together with his owne meanes, the lyfe of himſelfe, his kinſmen, friends, and ſuch other as would follow him in ſuch an enterpriſe, as much perforced and vncommodious as it was. The king greatly bewailed ſuch an accident: but as hee was one of the beſt princes and moſt eaſie to bee managed, as France euer ſawe, hee dyd not greatly torment himſelfe, thorough the hope which the Cardinall of Lorraine and the Dutches of Valentinois had giuen vnto him. How the whole matter could not but receue an happie iſſue, and how that the Conſtable, chiefe of armes, might aſſemble men enough to make head to the Spaniard, if it would pleaſe his maieſtie but to ſende him towardes the frontires, there to make readie the campe. The which hee was commanded to doo. So as hee departed from Compeigne, (where the king as then laie gouerned by thoſe of Guiſe) with ſpeed inough to go to Noſtre dame de Lieſſe, there to receiue his troupes together, which ſhould bee ſent vnto him out of all partes. In the meane time they ſtudyed vpon all meanes (the kings treaſure beeing alreadie drawen drie) how to procure monie for the entertaining of ſuch an armie, in which appeared great difficulties, accompanyed with grieuous complaintes in many places. In ſumme, beſides the great and ordinary impoſtes which were leuied vpon the people, new taxes and particular loanes were put vpon them, with ſurcharges ſo exceſsiue, as they grew intollerable vpon the third eſtate, which the continuance of the warres had alreadie eaten almoſt to the bare bones. The miniſters and beneficed men of the

Church; albeit they alleadged how that they were exempt, &amp; priuiledged from ſuch charges, were neuer a whit ſpared, but ſeazed according to their tenths, to the vtmoſt value of the reuenue of theyr Benefices. The Nobilitie but euen freſhly returned frō the warres paſſed, with a hope of a good repoſe, to helpe vp themſelues againe, ſettle order in their houſes, and eſtabliſh theyr reuenues to come, was agayne called, as wel to appeare in the Rirebandes, as to inroll themſelues in the kinges ordinances, who diſpatched commiſsions to leauie new companies, and to fyll vp the olde. The Ringraue bringing vnto him one thouſand Piſtolliers, and eight hundred Lansknets, came to ioyne with his forces. In the meane ſpace to preuent the firſt deſseines of his enemie, to fauour the aduancement of the fortifications vpon the frontiers, and whileſt that the armie was making readie, at the end of Ianuarie, 1557. the reſt of the men at armes of France, were ſent as the moſt ready force which the king had, to be diuided among the moſt dangerous frontires, eſpecially in Campagne. For that the imperials ordinaryly made theyr deſcent moſt that waies, and to fauor the fortification of Rocroy, which ſerued as a counterfort and ſupport to Mariembourg and Maubert Fontaine. Fortifying in lyke ſorte, and munitioning the reſt of the places vppon the frontire, they repayred vp agayne the platforme and pan of the wall behinde the caſtle of Mezieres, which was much fallen downe. The ſpring notwithſtanding and moſt part of the Summer paſſed ouer, without anie matter worthie of memorie, ſauing the attempt of certaine of the garriſons vpon Roc Roy, which I wil ſhew vnto you. After hauing repreſented the place to the naturall.Roc Roy and his repreſentation. It is a barren ſoile more than two leagues round about it, where you can ſee nothing but high woods, ſtanding water, and marriſhes, eſpecially in the waſt &amp; vnmanured places groweth nothing but briers, thorns, broome, and heath, for that the molde thereof is clay: the plains &amp; bottomes all mooriſh where the fort ſtandeth. The reſt of the places are hard and ſharpe rocks, without anie moiſture or bearing of fruit, ſauing catmint and moſſe, which maketh it farre vnfit for the incamping of an armie, by meanes of the ſeate and barrennes of the place. The fort hath fiue frontes, which they tearme in forme of Pantagone, couered and defended with four great bulwarkes, garniſhed with their flankers, Cazamates, &amp; platformes: then the old fort which ſerueth for the fift, each carrying his particular name, ſo great and ſpacious, that euerie one may lodge two thouſand ſouldiers, and a greate deale of artillery. A matter verie commodious for the retrenches and rampires againſt the enemie.
            Moreouer, the defences there are ſo ſurely couered, and without anie daunger of batterie, that it is verie vneaſie to take them awaie: ioynt that the heeles and ſhoulders thereof are ſo large and thicke, that they couer a great part of the Courtines. And for the better enduring of the rampire, the turfe and the earth is ſo claie and ſlammie, as if it ſoake in neuer ſo little water, it ſtiffneth and hardneth inough of it ſelfe. Therefore the fourth of Aprill the imperiall garriſons beeing aſſembled together, marched ſo ſecretly to breake downe the banke, which as yet was reared but two foot high, as thinking that the moſt part of the ſouldiers would ſallie out vpon their curriors, with reſolution to cut off theyr waie, and ſo hew them in peeces. Then (together with ſuch as fled to enter peſle meſle within the forte) they ſawe the ſouldiers euen and anone ſallying out file a file to the skirmiſh, againſt the firſt, as the indiſcreet heat of the French doth alwayes carrie. But the whole companie comming vpon them to cut off their retreate, the reſt which were within the forte in armes, to make the view and deale the laſt, iſſued forth ſo readily, and with ſuch reſolute charges, as the other were conſtrained to drawe backe and retyre themſelues in the end, to defend themſelues from the

number of Cannon ſhot which played vpon them with out ceaſing.
            Paſsing ouer thus ſome time in theſe light attempts, the ſeuenth of Iune the Queen of England ſent an Heralde of armes to proclaime warre vnto the king, who, the king hauing made it bee declared vnto him by the Conſtable, how graciouſlye hee vſed him, in reſpect of the puniſhment which hee deſerued, in that he had paſſed thorough his realme without ſafe conduct, was curteouſly ſent backe with preſents, and his anſwere: which was, how hee accepted of the defiance, in hope to make her know, that wythout anie occaſion at all ſhee had offered this vnto him, conſidering the good offices which had paſſed as well from himſelfe as his aunceſtours towardes her and her nation.
            Likewiſe it was ſufficiently inough apparant, how that ſhee had beene as it were importuned heereunto by her husband, in reſpect of the diuiſions and partialities of that Realme, as well betweene the Engliſh and the Spaniardes, as among the Engliſh themſelues. The moſt parte imagining howe that theyr new king, diminiſhing theyr forces and meanes by ſuch warres, would ſeeke the more eaſily to make himſelfe maſter of theyr fortreſſes, and vſurpe the ſuperintendance, which he ſo much longed after, to manage all things at his owne will and pleaſure. You ſhall elſe-where ſee what inſued heereupon. In Iuly the Prince of Piemont, Almora Earle of Eguemond, the Duke of Aſcot, and others, prepared an armie at Giuets, curious to performe the matter better than they dyd at the firſt attempt. Which they had aſſembled together for to haue ſurpriſed Rocroy, at the verie firſt puſh. But their vant curriers were ſo luſtily ſet vpon by thoſe which iſſued out to the skirmiſh, as the groſſe comming to aſsiſt and ſupport them after a long meley of hot buckling together, and infinite Cannon ſhot which rained among them, was conſtrayned in the end to leaue a great number of theyr dead behinde in the field, whileſt they turned vppon the frontire of Picardie,K. Phillips armie. as if they had meant to haue attempted vpon Guiſe, before which the whole imperiall armie laie of thirtie fiue thouſand men, and twelue thouſande horſe, tarrying for eight thouſand Engliſhmen: who landing at Calis and in the Countie Doye,K. Henries armie. was to ioyne wyth them at Saint Quentines. King Henrie his armie aſſembled it ſelfe at the ſame time at Atygnie. But as theyr foreſight was not ſo great as the Spaniſh, no more was theyr number, nor theyr meanes found to be alike. There might be about eighteene thouſand fantaſsins of Almanes and French, fiue or ſixe thouſand horſe, of light men at armes, as well French as Almaine, coaſting alwaies notwithſtanding the imperials within foure or fiue leagues following, the Countrie of Tieraſche, reſolued to cloſe themſelues within Pierre Ponte, a place very commodious to ouerrun the whol frontire, and there to diſtribute ſuccours among the garriſons, with ſuretie of thoſe troupes which ſhould keepe the field.
            The aduantage which grew vnto the imperials thorough their long foreſight,The aduauntages which the Spaniards &amp; Flemings had ouer the French. hauing brought foorth vnto them ſo ſtrong an armie, and the variable and diligent diſmarch of theyr troupes, cauſed that the French beeing inſolent, and contemning the enemyes forces, (againſt whome ordinarily they eſteemed it inough to prepare them ſelues vpon the blow and intelligence which preſented it ſelfe) did in no ſorte prouide to withſtand the enterpriſe of Phillip, and beeing at the verie pinch vncertayne of his intent, they were not able to iudge by the deportments of his armie to what place he meant, whereby they might furniſh it as were neceſſarie. So as firſt the Kinges councell, and afterwardes the Conſtables, beeing diuided into two partes, ſome thought that the Prince of Piemont would vndertake nought elſe, and turned to no other end than to make an honorable retreate. For that not hauing bene able to aſſemble his armie

together ſo ſoone as he imagined, through the diſtance of ſo many diuers countries, as he was to drawe his men out of, and other diſcommodities, the opportunitie was eſcaped him, far attempting any matter of great importaunce. Eſpecially for that he was repulſed from the Frontier of Champaigne, whither they ſayde his principall entente was. And albeit that other were of a contrarie opinion, aſſuring howe there was a certaine complotte, an aſſured Rende-vous, and a full foreſight determined, whither he meant to turne his Forces, as vnto a matter which he helde alreadie halfe conquered, beeing well aduertiſed of ſuch wante, as there mought be, ſo farre, as the Admirall did aſſure, (by intelligence receyued) the Coneſtable his Vnckle, how that the Prince meant to haue a blow at Picardie, as a place very euill prouided. Ioint that the Spaniſhe bandes which were within newe Hedin, (the beſt Troupes which they had) were not as yet diſlodged: the Frenche, (as mens ſenſes being diſperſed doe leſſe apprehende one of thoſe things which they doe beholde, then if they were all fixed vpon that alone) being curious to furniſhe the whole, prouided not ſufficiently either for the armie, or any other of thoſe places, whereby they mought ſtay the enemie, who ſtill entertayned them with his long delayes, and irreſolutions, thorough the vncertainetie of his diſſein, vntill that the Prince, hauing made a ſhowe, as though he woulde firſt encampe before Guiſe, then at Mariembourg, had encloſed rounde S. Quentins with his light Cauallerie.S. Quentin enuironed rounde before that the Frenche once thought thereof and leſſe prouided for it. And at the ſame inſtant cauſing his whole armie to martche with extreame dilligence, hee founde himſelfe encamped rounde about it, before that euer he coulde be thought to haue bene halfe way. The ſuddaineſſe whereof made the whole Campe to doubte leaſt the place woulde be taken by ſurpriſe, as well for wante of men, as other prouiſions and fortifications within the Towne, which had but the Captaine Brueil for gouernour, and Telligny, Lieutenaunt to the Daulphin, of a Companie of one hundred men at armes: the better parte of whome were therein Garriſon, at which the Inhabitauntes grewe ſo greatly diſcontented, conſidering as they alleadged, that their priuiledges did exempte thē from them, as whatſoeuer enſued thereupon, was rather attributed to their owne faulte then to any others. The Admirall, being commaunded by the Coneſtable, to get into the Towne with as many men as hee ſhoulde be able, vnder a hope of being ſuccoured by him:Gaſpard Coligny Admirall and Gouernour of Piccardie getteth into S. Quentin. albeit that Iarnac and Luſarche offered themſelues to goe thither, and keepe him from aduenturing ſo great a danger, perſwading him to employ himſelfe ſomewhere elſe, where he ſhoulde be able to doe the King more ſignall ſeruice, then to caſt away himſelfe there within, did ſo much notwithſtanding, as with foure hundred &amp; fiftie men, as well horſe as foote, he entred in. Afterwardes hauing made the Rounde about the walles, encouraged the Inhabitauntes: whome he aſſembled together in the common Hall, viſited the whole Towne thorough, ouerlooked the prouiſions and munitions of warre, and giuen the quarters vnto Companies, he prouided for all the reſt the beſt which he was able. Now for that Iulian Romero, and Carondelet ſpaniſh Captaines had alreadie gayned the bulwarke of Fauxbourg d'Iſle, where they had ſettled their Enſeignes, notwithſtanding any reſiſtaunce which could be made. Iointe that it was without parapette, and the earth without as high as within, the Admirall yſſued out to regayne it, and to burne the houſes about. But the beſieged were ſo euill receyued, and hottely purſued, as many returned hurte, counſelling the Admirall to abandon that Fauxbourg, conſidering the ſmall number of men which he had, and the two paſſages to the Flankers thereof, by which the enemie mought cutte betweene the Fauxbourg and the Towne, and ſo hinder the retreat of ſuch as ſhoulde defende it. But he would needes ſtill holde it vntill a greater occaſion

were offred, to ſet a good countenance vpon it. Hereupon beeing willing to viewe the encamping of his enemies, he commanded Teligny, to cauſe 50. horſe of his Cō
               panie to fallie out vnder the conducte of ſome aſſured man at armes, onely to viewe,Howe a ſallie ought to be made vpon the enemie. enioyning them by no meanes to ſight, and eſpecially, that he ſhoulde not goe himſelfe: But ſeeing the Couriers engaged, and in diſorder, he was no ſooner aduanced without armour, and vpon a bad court all to cauſe them to retire, but he was wrapped in, throwne downe to the grounde, wounded to death, ſtripte naked, and afterwarde carryed away by a ſouldier, who hazzarded his life, for the rewarde, which the Admirall had promiſed vnto him. This done, perceyuing the preparratiues of the enemie to batter the Fauxbourg d'Iſle, hauing carryed away whatſoeuer was portable, and prouided for the burning of the houſes vpon the watch worde giuen, hee quitted it, and cauſed the whole to be burned. Nowe as the Inhabitantes had hidde their prouiſions, notwithſtanding any commaundement or dilligence vſed to forbid them, (among whome the Maior aloane and the Sire de Gibercourte, were noted to doe their duetie) ſo their faulte in concealing the powder, which had lyen a long time hidde in the Towres of the gate of the Fauxbourg d'Iſle, was a cauſe of great inconuenience. For to the ende they mought carrie it away, as ſoone as it was diſcouered, the cakes being all rotten and mouldering into pieces, they were fayne to put it into blankettes, where the fire tooke ſo at vnawares, with ſuch violence, of this diueliſhe mixtion, as it made a breache of more then fiue and thirtie paces,Gunpowder. beſides the loſſe of ſixe and thirtie ſeruiceable men, which wente all into ſmoake. Whereupon the enemie had a fayre occaſion preſented to vndertake ſome thing to his aduantage, if the fire of the houſes of the Fauxbourg which burned, had not taken away the ſight of this breache from the Spanyardes, who mought eaſily haue entered in at the beginning, for that euery man was retired to feede, and other neceſſaries. And albeit that the Coneſtable greatly payned himſelfe, to get ſuccour into the Towne, according to the aduiſe, which he had receyued from the Admirall, who to this ende had ſente foorth Vaupergue, and from the toppe of a ſteeple had ſhewed him by what wayes they were to take their courſe, yet Dandelot his brother was not able to bring any in, for that certayne Engliſhemen priſoners among the Spanyardes, had aduertiſed them of this enterpriſe. An occaſion that hauing entrenched and furniſhed the high way to Han, by which they were to paſſe with harquebuſiers, (for ſo much as that quarter being allotted to ſuch Engliſhmen as were ioyned vnto King Philips Armie, was leſſe peopled with men of warre) the thirde parte was there ſlayne,Meanes to ſende ſuccours to the beſieged, and howe to be better aſſured. and the reſt enforced to ſaue themſelues, albeit they had a nomber of men at armes and light horſe to aſſiſte them with hotte alarmes, whileſt that they ſhoulde enter in: In the meane ſpace to viewe the Countrie, and to hinder the enemie from enlarging himſelfe, attempting vpon him as occaſions were proffered. But Vaupergue, had not ſufficiently marked the places which were ſhewed vnto him for his entraunce in, but gaue ſtraight vpon a Corps de guarde of Fantaſſins, in ſteade of paſſing betweene it, and one other of Cauallerie. Where he ſhould haue founde nothing but Sentinels, and haue bene able to gayne a little hill, all alongeſt the Vines, by which the Captaine S. Andre had entered in by fayre day light. An occaſion that the Admirall had nowe ynough to doe, to encourage the beſieged, aſſuring them that the Coneſtable woulde not ſuffer them to be loſt within, and that together with himſelfe, ſo many Gentlemen would not tarrie there if they ſuppoſed they ſhould be but loſte. It was about this time, that nine thouſande Engliſhmen, &amp; 1500. horſe,Engliſhmen ioyned to K. Philips Armie. ariued at the campe vnder the charge of the Earle of Penbrooke, Clinton, and Gray, lodged as I before

told you. In the meane time the Admirall cauſed 700. idle monthes to be put cut, to eaſe the towne ſo much in fauour of the voluntary men. The Prince euen as ſoone made his trenches, and aproches againſt the porte of Romicourt, vnder the fauour of the hedges and trees, which had not beene before cutte vp by the beſeeged. Whereof the Admirall aduertiſed the Conſtable, and of the mariſh, by which way onely they were then able to ſuccour them: promiſing to rampire and fill vp certaine little deepe channels, which hindered their paſſage. The which he did by the Captaine S. Romain: and to croſſe the Riuer which runneth through and ouerfloweth this mariſh: they cauſed fowre boates to be brought, vpon which, being chained together, and reaching from the one ſhoare to the other, they might well haue paſſed, if they had beene able to lande on the banke, whileſt that a hotte alarum were giuen to the whole campe. Vpon which the Conſtable being reſolued, hee departed the 8. of Auguſt from La Fere, with two thouſand horſe, fower thouſande Fantaſſins, as well Almaines as French, trayning fower field peeces alongeſt. Being ariued ouer againſt the village called Le grand Eſsigny: he made a ſtand, and taking the D. of Neuers, the Prince of Conde, and ſome others, he aproched as neere as he was able to S. Quentin, as farre as the deſcent of the mariſh without diſcouering any enemy. Afterwardes hee ſent Du Fumett to viewe neerer, and make report of the diſtance of the enemy from the towne, and of the mariſh from them, together with the largenes of the riuer. The which he did, with two other more, who agreed ſomewhat with his report: whereupon on S. Laurence day in the morning the tenth of the moneth, there were ſet in battaile, at the place of execution neere La Fere ſixteene French enſignes, and two and twentie Almaine with fifteene peeces of artillarie, whither the whole cauallerie came to ioyne with them. Then they aduanced as farre as S. Quentines by nine of the clock right to the fauxbourge de Liſle on the ſide of fourteene Spaniſh Enſignes, where the whole was ſet in order of battaile. On the ſide beyond the water, and the mariſh, was the Prince of Piemont &amp; his army, far ſtretched forth, hauing for ſentinell, within a mile on this ſide, two Spaniſh Enſignes, which were ſodenly turned downe and conſtrained to retire themſelues beyonde the cauſey. At the ſame inſtant the french artillery thundered ſo furiouſly vpon the Campe, &amp; eſpecially into the Princes Tent, as he had no leaſure to put on his armour, to retyre himſelfe into the next quarter of the Count of Aiguemont: to whom euery man retired in a ſtrange diſorder. Now for that they doubted a certaine dangerous paſſage, diſtant about one league from Fauxbourg d'iſle, (where the french Cauallery lay) they ſent thither a cornet of the Renigraues piſtoliers, to the end to haue newes ſooner by them, then footmen, which were rather like to be loſt then ſuccoured, as alſo that they were the more eaſily able to retire. And for a greater ſtrength the D. of Neuers went thither with three companies of men at armes. Vpon this the Conſtable vſed all meanes to make his men to enter in: but the boates not being able to come to the other ſhore, through the aboundance of the ſouldiers, which entred in by ſuch heapes, and diſorderlie, were ſo ouerladen, as by reaſon of the durte and ouſe in which they ſtooke, it was vnpoſſible for any great number of men to paſſe ouer: beſides at the going out of the boates, the preſſe of the ſouldiers was ſuch as they were not able to follow the waies and pathes ſhewed vnto them. An occaſion that they ſcattered▪ and fell into the deepe ditches of the mariſh, whence they were not able to get out, but remained there all mirie, and the moſt part drowned miſerablie.
            
               The Prince of Pimont reſalueth to charge, to hinder the reſt from entring in, or to breake the Frenche Armie.The Prince in the meane ſpace hauing taken reſolution to charge vpon ſo few men before the appointed ſuccours were al entred in, the artillarie ceaſing to annoy them,

any further, cauſed the Compte of Aiguemont to paſſe ouer the paſſage with two thouſande horſe, which the Frenche durſte not encounter withall, and then two other Companies followed after with Battailions of foote, during whoſe paſſages, ſome gaue counſell to the Coneſtable to charge vpon them which were alreadie paſſed ouer. But their aduice preuailed, who rather counſelled a retreate, then to aduaunce further with ſo fewe men, conſidering the furious diſmartche of their enemies: Ioynte that hee was not come thither to hazzarde the Forces of Fraunce, excepte that hee were greatly conſtrayned thereunto. And further howe hee had ſuccoured and furniſhed Saint Quintin with all neceſſaries, as hee thought in ſpight of the enemie. Thus the Duke of Neuers retyred to Louys de Bourbon Prince of Conde, who had the charge of certayne light Cauallerie, which the Coneſtable had cauſed to tarrie at a Windemille. With whome being ioyned, and keeping the lefte winge, they came ſafe and ſounde vnto the Coneſtable, who alwayes gayned grounde of the retreate, whileſt that his enemies encreaſing, aduaunced forwardes, and had alreadie gotten aduauntage of him, in eighte great battailions of Cauallerie and Reiſtres. Yea, they viewed him ſo neere, as the Coneſtable imagining that hee had well enough prouided for the place, and that by the temporiſing of his enemies, they woulde not dare to come backe vpon him, made no other accounte, then ſoftely to retyre. The which the enemie attributing in the beginning to an aſſured reſolution of Combatte, ſhewed himſelfe vncertayne of the charge, vntill that perceyuing the Financiers, marchauntes and other,The occaſion of the charge giuing. (following the Warres for their pleaſure, or profite) to retyre apace, to ſaue themſelues, with their money and marchandiſes, from an enemie ſo neere vnto them, and afterwardes the ſeruauntes, whome they cauſed to bate to retyre, all which chaunging their pace to a galloppe, aſtonyed at the retreat of theſe marchauntes, retyred themſelues with great cryes, witneſſes of the feare which had alreadie poſſeſſed them, it made the Compte of Aiguemont to thinke, who ſuddaynely cauſed the Prince to be aduertiſed thereof, that the Frenche Armie quaked, and that it was nowe time to trye their fortune, and to charge vpon ſuch an aduauntage. In the ende, this Flemmiſhe Compte, hauing after he had receyued commaundement from the Prince, conferred a while with the Chiefe men which accompanyed him, leauing the Compte of Saint Cheualsbourg, with his Regiment of Reiſtres to keepe the paſſage, charged thorough a Flancke with two thouſande horſe, at the ſame time as the Earles Henry and Erueſt of Brunſwich, eache followed with one thouſande Reiſtres, backed and encouraged by the Compte of Horne, with a thouſande men at armes of the ordinances of the Countrie, ſette all as it were with one trotte vpon the other Flancke, at the very ſame inſtaunte, as the Earles of Maunſfielde, Vuilen, Doſtrat, and of Geldres with other three thouſande horſe, threwe vnder foote the middeſt with ſuch a furie, as hauing ouerthrowne the firſt Ranckes, and thoſe which ſeconded them, all the ſurplus was put to flight.
            
               Iohn of Burbon Duke of Anguien, being beaten downe,The defeate and route of the Frenche at S. Quentins. and afterwardes remounted, was ſlayne at the ſeconde Charge, and in the ende being brought vnto the Prince, hee cauſed him to bee carryed with all honour to bee buried at La Fere.
            
               Frauncis de la Tour, Vicompte of Turaine, S. Gelais, and more then ſixe hundred Gentlemen dyed there, with foure thouſand as well French as Almaine Fantaſſins, and well neere 300. men of marke taken priſoners. The D. of Neuers was retired to

La Fere, Eſpeuilles, Enſeigne to his men at armes, gaue his colours to Chazeilles to ſaue it. And his Guidon S. Simon beeing ouerthrowne, had beene taken priſoner, if D' Auerly had not ſlayne him which carryed him. The Coneſtable ſore wounded in the haunche, was carried away priſoner, and ſo was the Duke of Montpenſier. As alſo the Mareſchall S. Andre, Ludouic Prince of Mantoue, the Reingraue, Roche-foucat, S. Heron,
               Frenchmē dead, priſoners and eſcaped from the battayle of S. Quentins. 
               Bordillon, Mouy, Montſales, and many other of name. As ſoone as the Fanterie perceiued this diſorder, it ſet it ſelfe in ſquare battailions, but being ouerthrown, reſiſted no whit at all. So as many lying bleeding, and dead vpon the grounde, the reſt were ledde away priſoners by troupes like muttons. Who at the comming of King Philip were preſented vnto him, with their weapons and coulours, in tryumph of ſo great and ſignall a Victorie, happened betweene Eſſigny and Rizerolles. Being purſued by the ſpace of foure howres, vntill euening, frō the Blanc-foſſe where the ſlaughter beganne, vnto the gallowes diſtaunt one league from La Fere, where two pieces of Artillerie onely were recouered: the which Bordillon went afterwardes to fetche, to carrie them to La Fere, where the Duke of Neuers, Chiefe of the reſt, the Prince of Conde, the Compte of Sancerre, Bordillon and other ſaued them ſelues. And ſhortly after ſuch as were eſcaped from the Combatte, and out of priſon, retired themſelues in farre greater nomber then was hoped for. But ſtripped of all they had.
            
               The Duke of Neuers Chiefe of ſuch as eſcaped, reaſſembleth the reſt of the battaile, and howe he prouided for the whole.This done, the Duke of Neuers ſente rounde aboute, to make it knowne vnto the diſperſed ſorte, howe that the Rende-vous of the Armie was appointed at Laon, Where he aſſured them that they ſhoulde receyue their paye, which they had not ſeene of many monethes together. This done, hauing furniſhed the Frontires with men and munitions the beſt which he was able, he aduertiſed the King of the eſtate wherein his affayres ſtoode, and beſought the Prince of Piemont, to ſende vnto him the nomber rolle of ſuch priſoners of marke as were taken. Then together with the Prince of Conde he retired within Laon, with ſixe hundred horſe the reſidue of all the Troupes. He lefte Bordillon at La Fere, and the Compte of Sancerre at Guiſe. Afterwardes the King ſente De Pot to Han, &amp; De Lorges to Noyon, there to aſſemble together the Gentlemen of his houſe, and the Archers of his guards, and to prouide for thoſe quarters, according as neede ſhoulde require.
            
               Paris ſcareth the comming of K. Philip no leſſe then afore time his fathers Charles the Emperour.Hereupon the King retired himſelfe from Compienne to Paris, thereby to aſſure the Inhabitauntes, who alreadie quaked, ſeeking to retyre themſelues, with the more pretious parte of their goodes, and moueables, into the furtheſt parts of the Realme. To whome firſt he ſent the Queene, who was quickely at the Guilde hall, where ſhe demaunded, and obtayned a graunt of three hundred thouſande livers, after an Oration made by the Cardinall Bertrande, Archbiſhoppe of Sens, Lorde Keeper. Who in ſumme declared vnto them.
            
               
                  HOwe that the Lorde God, hauing choſen and appointed him for their King, by like meanes had created and lefte vnto him, a hearte and affection to rule them, preſerue and defende them, euen to the aduenturing of his owne life: Therefore that they ſhoulde aſſure themſelues, that hee woulde no more abandon them, then that he had this firme beliefe, howe the diuine Grace would neuer faile him, to which if it hath ſeemed good to ſende vnto him this misfortune, it was an admonition, to acknowledge the Almightie, who diſtributeth all thinges according to his good pleaſure as well to great as ſmall.
                  The K. demaundeth ſuccour of the Parisſians. 
                  Nowe, albeit that he receiued it as a puniſhement &amp; chaſtiſemēt for his offences, or it mought be his Peoples, yet the danger was not ſo great &amp; ineuitable, but that meanes were lefte of remedie, conſidering the ſuccours, which they are to ſeeke of

the God of Victories. And that of themſelues they woulde be an ayde vnto themſelues, and eſpecially to him in this deſperate neceſſitie, Whereupon they had to conſider, that ſo long as the rentes of his reuennewe, were able to ſtreatche out towardes the maintenance of theſe warres, he had not importuned them, by ſurcharges of demaundes, and redoublementes of taskes, or other contributions: But that hee was alwayes willing, rather to ſell and morgage his owne Demayne, exchaunge and borrowe elſewhere, then to fleece or moleſte them. But ſince that nowe he was no longer able to ſatisfie them, thorough the affayres which daylye redoubled vpon him, as they mought ſee and perceiue with their owne eyes, therefore he beſought them that they would ſuccour him onely with money, and that for the reſt they woulde relye themſelues vpon him, who of his parte woulde neuer fayle them in will, and good affection, nor yet in force or power to ſuccour them, or in any thing elſe which mought appertaine to the authoritie or Eſtate of a King towardes his ſubiectes.
               
            
            Brieflie the Parisſians reacknowledging the good zeale of their Prince, accorded willingly vnto him three hundred thouſande livers, as alſo the reſt of the capitall Cities of the Prouinces, contributed as their abilitie ſtretched. With the which he ſent into Zwizerlande, to leuie ſixe thouſande men, vnder the Colonell Luc Reiſtre of Baſle, and on the other ſide eight thouſande vnder Claris de Haris. Likewiſe he ſente the Colonell Rechrod, to make an other leuie of Almaine footemen. Albeit that the Countrie was much vnfurniſhed thorough the leuies of King Phillip, and of another which the Baron of Poleuille made there of twentie Enſignes, and certaine Reiſtres. Beſides this, the King ſente worde vnto the Duke of Guiſe, by Scipion his eſcuyer, howe he ſhoulde ſettle all things in Italie, to the moſt aduantage which he were able,The meanes which the K. of Fraunce vſed for his better aſſurance after the battaile of S. Quentin. and withdrawe his Forces hitherwards. In the meane time it was ordred that generall muſters ſhoulde be made of the Inhabitantes of Paris, ouer whome there commaunded Charles de Bourbon, Prince De la Roche-Suryon in Poitou. This done, the King being ſhortly after ariued from Compienne, generall proceſſions were made, whither likewiſe Paul de Termes was ſente for, for the reputation of his vertue, eſpecially in feates of Armes. Who being come, cauſed to be broken off, that vnprofitable deuice, of the long trenches, which they had begunne at Paris on the ſide of Mont-martre, the better to aſſure that paſſage. In the ende proclamation was made in the Kinges name, thorough out all the Countreyes, that all ſouldiers, Gentlemen, or other, which eyther had followed, or were able to carrie armes, ſhoulde retyre to Laon, towards the D. of Neuers, his Lieutenaunt generall, to the ende they mought be there employed for his ſeruice, and ſafetie of the Countrie. And that all ſuch as woulde followe the warres for their owne pleaſure, ſhoulde retire themſelues aboute his perſon, vnder payne of being declared Rebelles, puniſhed corporally as villaines, and diſgraded of all Nobilitie.
            Such an accident was ſoone enough able to chaunge the affayres of the Courte. Yea, to eſtabliſhe an other kinde of fourme altogether, in the managing of the Eſtate of Fraunce, ouer which the Coneſtable ſeemed to holde the aduantage. But his taking cauſed it to fall into the handes of the Cardinall of Lorraine, and Dutcheſſe of Valentinois, who kept it for the Duke of Guiſe, as ſoone as hee ſhoulde bee come to the Courte. During the attendance of whoſe Forces, the Duke of Neuers aſſembling together ſuch as were eſcaped from the battaile, and as many more as hee was able, gaue foorth a nomber of Commisſions to Leuie in the Kinges name, newe Companies, and ſente De iours to fetche the Leagion of Champagne, whereof hee had beene chiefe Captayne, and drewe fiue Enſeignes out of the Garriſon

of Metz, and other olde bandes of the Garriſons neare hande, in whoſe ſteade hee ſent newe, not ceaſing to ſende forth men of all handes to viewe, learne newes, and vpon any good intelligence, to charge at their aduantage. In the meane ſpace the Prince of Conde ſuffered no more the enemie to repoſe himſelfe, then the light horſe as alſo did the Earles of Sancerre and Bordillon of their parte. And albeit that the Captayne Graye his Engliſhe light horſe,The Engliſhe which ſerued K. Henry gained by thoſe of Philips ſide, leaue their Captaine and flye. hauing quitted him, and carryed away his armour and horſe, gaue occaſion to the enemie to ſende two thouſande horſe as farre as Oyſe, to paſſe ouer there, and ſtoppe theſe Couriers, yet durſte they not for all that venter any further, but returned to the Campe, hauing founde the Frenche watchfull at all handes, as diſgrace awakeneth and keepeth all kinde of perſons within their duetie, more then proſperitie, or any other accident.
            To returne to the Mareſchall Briſſac his actions in Piemont, whileſt that hee employed his armie, in attending the effect of the long promiſes, which had bene made him of his paye, to waſte the Countrie rounde about Foſſan, blocke in Cony, and hindering them both from hauing any ſuccoures, eſpecially of victualles or other neceſſaries, De Lambres, an ordinarie groome of the Kinges Chamber, was diſpatched vnto him, on the 15. of Auguſt, to aduertiſe him of the defeat, and taking of the Coneſtable,Defeate of S. Quentins. De Termes and De Anuille. vnder Saint Quentins, and of the continuance of the Siege thereof. And further carryed a commaundement vnto him, to ſende away thither out of hande, De Termes, and D'Anuille, with their Companies, &amp; the Regiment of Swizers which were in Piemont, the better to further the affayres of the Realme. Whereupon a Counſell was helde, at Lagaſque, and therein it was reſolued that they ſhoulde departe with their Companies. And how that in regarde of the Swizers, and other affayres which as then fell out, the Secretarie Bounin ſhoulde bee diſpatched, with charge to condole with his Maieſtie, for ſo great a loſſe, and diſaſtre on the behalfe of all his ſeruantes in Piemont. And further moſt humblie to deliuer vnto him, what their opinion and aduiſe was, for the preuenting of ſuch inconueniences, as mought growe by ſuch an accident: The ſubſtance whereof was howe his Maieſtie ſhould himſelfe embrace the conducte of his affayres, and commaunde a Leuie forthwith to be made, of twentie thouſande Almaines, and thirtie thouſande Frenche, with correſpondent Forces of Cauallerie. And that this armie mought bee on foote, before ſuch time as the enemie ſhoulde haue taken Saint Quentins, or at the leaſt aſſayled, taken, and fortified any other place, That to be able to reſtore all thinges into good tearmes, and for a long time to entertaine the ſaide Armie, it were neceſſarie to make a good prouiſion of money, taking vp to that ende, an whole yeeres reuennewe of the Biſhoprickes, Abbayes, and other benefices, without excepting anye, ſauing ſuch as ſtill trauayled, and ſpente their owne about his Maieſtie. Who mought, if it pleaſed him, beginne with the Biſhoppe of Conſtance, Couſin to the ſayde Mareſchall.The K. meanes to drawe out of the Cleargies &amp; Nobilities reuennewes. Who likewiſe was of aduiſe, that the Eſtates ſhoulde be aſſembled, and that his Maieſtie in perſon ſhoulde deliuer the neceſſitie of his affayres, and demaunde ſuccour therein. And that all that, which mought be ſo drawne out, was not able to ſupplie the wante: That he ſhould in the like ſorte helpe himſelfe by the Nobilitie, beginning with him, taking all his reuennewes, ſauing two thouſande livers, which mought be left to his wife, to nouriſhe her ſelfe and her children withall. That the Swizers ſhoulde make themſelues readye to martch, albeit that they were ſo tyred, and neare driuen of all handes, by being euill payde, as that they woulde hardly be able to bee ariued within Fraunce, before that the occaſion for which his M. ſought

them were paſſed ouer. And that by this meanes Piemont without cauſe woulde remayne vnarmed, and in great daunger: beſides the loſſe of time and expence, which had bene employed and beſtowed vpon the bringing of the ſayde Foſſan and Cony into that extreame neceſſities in which they then ſtoode. But at the ſeconde ſummons of his Maieſtie, the Swizers muſt of neceſſitie be ſent away,The Swizers goe out of Piemont who as it was foretolde grewe altogether vnprofitable, thorough the long aboade which they made at Lions, being very ſicke, weake, and euill payde.
            Nowe the Mareſchall hauing vnderſtood that vpon this defeate his Maieſtie had cauſed newe Companies of men at armes to be addreſſed, hee greatly beſought for La Mothe Gondrin, Franciſque Bernardrin de Pauan, and Vicompt Gourdon, but they mought not be gratified. He offered for all that to come in perſon himſelfe vnto his Maieſtie, in this his great neceſſitie to doe him ſeruice, but it woulde not bee accepted.
            Certayne dayes after his Maieſtie perceyuing howe few Forces were remayning in Piemont, the Swizers being departed thence, and foreſeeing the daunger of ſome inconuenience like to enſue, ſente worde vnto the Mareſchall, that in ſteade of thoſe Swizers, he ſhoulde with all ſpeede leuie newe Companies of foote, and that hee ſhoulde wante no money to that ende. Notwithſtanding there was onely ſente to paye the olde bandes, which were in extreame neceſſitie, many monethes hauing bene due vnto them: Yea, and in ſteade of remedying the neceſſities of Piemont, his Maieſties pleaſure was, to accept the offer, which vnwitting to the Mareſchall was made vnto him by the Vidaſme of Chartres, Colonell of the Infanterie,The Vidaſme of Chartres carieth 2000. Fantaſſins into Fraunce. for carrying into Fraunce from thence two thouſand Frenche harquebuſiers, and as many Italians. Which being accordingly put in execution, it was altogether apparaunt, that thereby his Maieſties affayres were put into extreame perill and ruyne, the enemies being ſtrong, and the Frenche feeble, ill payde, and comming ſo lately from receyuing the deſaſtre of the defeate of the Armie, and loſſe of Saint Quentins.
            As the time thus paſſed away, with verie ſmall aduauntage to the Kings affayres, the Preſident Baillif, made offer vnto the King of himſelfe, and vnwitting to the Mareſchall, that hee mought leuie in Piemont, two or three hundred thouſande crownes, leuying three crownes vpon euery houſholder, which offer was not onely accepted without any aduiſe at all demaunded of the Mareſchall, but there was likewiſe preſte money deliuered vnto him vpon the aſſignations of Piemont. And whileſt that his Maieſtie made difficultie to heare ſuch reaſons as mought bee alleadged touching the impoſſibilitie of ſuch a leuie, there was no prouiſion made for ſuccour of men, nor money, in ſo much as many loſſes and inconueniences were readye to enſue: Eſpecially for that the Vidaſme ſtill purſued the execution of his Leuie of two thouſande harquebuſiers.
            For if any man woulde haue conſtrayned the bandes of Piemont, to muſter without paye, it was to be feared that it would haue happened worſe then it did at Cony. The more likely, conſidering in what vnfauourable tearmes, his Maieſties affayres as then ſtoode. Who mought very well haue called to minde howe diuers and ſundrye times woorde was ſente vnto him, that the prolonging of the Muſters, was onely wrought and occaſioned, by the delaye of the money, the wante whereof rendred the ſouldiers poore, and made them diſobedient, and an euidente loſſe to the finances of his Maieſtie, which notwithſtanding they colde by no meanes remedie, without hauing meanes to make a rigorous muſter. All thinges being thus

conducted in this ſort, and the death of Salueſon happening gouernour of Caſal: his Maieſtie as he was accuſtomed to doe in like vacances, neuer tarying for the aduice &amp; nomination of the Marſhall,Death of Salueſon. placed Franciſque Bernardin therein, fayning as though he had vnderſtoode that hee and not La motte Gondrin had beene put into Caſal after the death of Salueſon.
               Franciſque Bernardin Gouernour of Caſal. And albeit that his Maieſtie did afterwardes reuoke this nomination, yet matters were in ſuch ſorte handeled as Franciſque Bernardin ſtil ſtomached the Marſhal the rather for that at his return from the Court into Piemont, he was not gratefied nor honoured in ſuch ſorte as hee expected: hee recommended likewiſe Mont baſin to haue the place of gentleman of the chamber which Salueſon before had.Salueſon gentleman of the Chamber. But he was not able to obtaine it, ſo as he, &amp; many other of the Kings ſeruantes, ſeeing how little credite was giuen to the Marſhals recommendations, albeit they were for men of merite began to diminiſh their affection, and ſome of them to aske leaue to depart homewardes to follow their aduauncement, alleadging that none but ſuch as went to the court were aduaunced and recompenſed. Thus vpon theſe occaſions,The credit of a Gouernour is impared among his owne except it appeare ſomewhat about his ſoueraigne. began many complaintes, diſobediences and quarrels to ariſe, which notwithſtandinge receiued an other kinde of conſtruction then this: ſo as being inforced thereunto the twenty and eyght of September, hee let the King to vnderſtand how many Captaines, gentlemen, and other officers daylie departed away without leaue as wel for want of pay, as that they perceiued right wel, how they ſhould neuer receiue any preferment, through his recommendation: among whome Pauan had for this occaſion quitted and giuen ouer his Lieuetenancie:Pauan, Baron of Adrek, Bouual de parte. and the Baron of Ardrets, the Captaine Bouuall, Sergent Maior of Caſal, and ſundry other perſonages who had long and faithfully ſerued. But notwithſtanding he made light account thereof, ſo as euerie man began to ſeeke an other ſupporte then his, and to perke vp the noſe againſt him. Now as his Maieſty ſtoode aduertiſed how that the enemies had leuied great companies of reſolute men in readines after the comming of the D. of Alua,
               The D. of Alua commeth in Piemont with his armie. (whome they attended within fewe dayes at Gennes with the forces of the kingdome of Naples) to aſſaile eyther Piemonte, or the D. of Ferrara, (who for that cauſe had made great inſtance, that his Maieſties forces might approch to the D. of Milan) the Marſhall beſought him to prouide thereto aſwell with force, as money: to the end he might preuent in time and place, ſuch inconueniences, which a man mought perceiue prepared as well on the one ſide as the other. And for ſo much as his maieſtie had made ſemblance to miſlike the difficultie which the Marſhal made vpon the leuy of two thouſande Harquebuſiers, whō the Vidaſme offred to bring into Fraunce, diſpatching the eighteene the Secretarie Bounin, for inſtance of ſupplie and prouiſion of money, he gaue him in charge to declare vnto his ſaide Maieſtie that whatſoeuer he had done was not with any intention to contrary his will, but for ſo much as his Maieſtie had not as then countermand (as he had done ſince the thirteenth) the Enſignes of the Zuizers, who not returning backe, and the ſaide two thouſande Harquebuſiers going away, there was ſmal likelihood. But Piemont would remaine altogether at the enemies diſcreation. And whē as this conſideration could not preuaile. Yet he ſaide that he had otherwiſe occaſion enough to remaine euill ſatiſfied, ſeeing that ſuch an offer had beene made without euer communicating the ſame vnto him, and afterwards accepted without euer demaunding his aduiſe,The Mareſhal 
                     〈◊〉
                   content. as it ſeemed reaſonable, ſince that he gouerned Piemont the principall charge whereof it pleaſed his Maieſtie to beſtowe vpon him. Notwithſtanding he ceaſed not all thinges layde by, rather to fauour then hinder the Vidaſme. And as it was giuen him in charge at the ſame time, to leuie, according to

the propoſition made by the Preſidente Bailly,
               Money leuied vpon Piemont. three crownes of taxe vpon euery houſholder, whereof his Maieſtie made full accounte, without demaunding his aduiſe at all therein, yet reſting onely vpon the ſeruice of his Maieſtie, hee did ſo much, as that he leuyed vpon the Countrey ſixe ſcore thouſande liuers, wherewith he relieued himſelfe, attending better prouiſion. Vpon which leuie, what fayre wordes ſoeuer or amiableneſſe he could vſe, many inconueniences were readie to enſewe. Shortly after, the King in like ſorte commaunded him, that hee ſhoulde ſende vnto him, by Lodun, the Commiſſions for the Captaynes, which ought to be prouided of vacant Companies, which hee muſt needes doe, albeit he had neuer meddled with thoſe Companies ſince the comming of the Vidaſme: notwithſtanding that all his predeceſſours had bene accuſtomed, to nominate the ſame companies, as had bene practiſed as well by himſelfe in his owne right being Colonell of the footemen, as by them which had bene before him. This diſgrace was likewiſe offered vnto him, that notwithſtanding any requeſt which had bene made by him in the fauour of Oſſun, and Fraunciſque Bernardin, to be a meanes they mought receyue the order, hee coulde neuer yeilde them any aſſurance thereof, but it was D'Anuille which carried it away, ſo as euer after they depended on the Coneſtable. In ſumme, the Mareſchall ſtill continuing, to make inſtaunce of ſupplie, wherewith he mought be able to oppoſe himſelfe againſt his enemies forces, who might vndertake eyther the forcing of ſome holde or fortifiyng themſelues in ſome new, and by that meanes mought abate their nomber, it was aunſwered him, that they were matters eaſier talked of then done, and that he muſt needes confeſſe, that winter was alwayes winter, during which ſeaſon, men were accuſtomed to ſurceaſe armes. An aunſwere in deede coyned by his enemies, who woulde not ſo much as call to minde the taking of Lans, Valence, Iuree, and ſundry other places in the monethes of December and Ianuarie, in the very hearte of Winter. Thus did the complayntes of the Mareſchall moue the Kinges Counſell bente to turne their eyes an other waye, no more, then the newes of their enemies comming into Piemont, no not ſo much as the deſcente of the Duke of Alua, at Gennes with 7000. men:The D. of Alua his armie at Gennes. and that attending their ariuall in Piemont, the enemies had put themſelues within Galliany, (which the Mareſchall willing to haue fortified, onely for a time to haue founde the enemie occupyed, was conſtrayned for want of money, to leaue and rayſe it) which they beganne to fortifie. And leſſe the going away of many Captaines and ſouldiers day by day, eſpecially the Captaine Benes who demaunded leaue to departe home to his owne houſe; and replie being made vnto him, that hee did but come thence, hee perſiſted to ſay that hee woulde goe, come what woulde, and whereas he was aduiſed to take time to conſider thereof, and afterwardes deliuer his minde vnto the Mareſchall, he refuſed it, and the nexte morning wente home without once bidding farewell. For this cauſe he beſought his Maieſtie, that ſuch diſobedience mought not goe vnpuniſhed, and that his Companie mought be beſtowed on the Captaine Liſle: which the King liked well of,Captaine Liſle. and yet was it afterwardes rendred agayne vnto him. Of which the Mareſchall afterwardes complayning, and ſtanding vpon, it had bene deliuered and beſtowed on the Captaine Liſle, Serieant of the Battayle, who had long and faithfully ſerued, they woulde yeelde no credite at all vnto him, but the companie was beſtowed vpon La Roche a gentleman of D'Anuilles, who had beene nothing ſo long a Seruitour. True it is that complainte beeing made of the wrong which thereby was done to the Mareſchall, it was in the ende reſtored to the Captaine Liſle. In fine the Mareſchall well weighing howe he was handled, &amp; how that

the inſtances and importunities which he continued as well by letters, as expreſſe meſſengers to haue the affaires of Piemont better prouided for, brought forth no fruit at all, as ſmall credit being yeelded thereunto, he beſought leaue of his Maieſty that he might come home, and kiſſe his hande, eſpecially to declare vnto him the eſtate of his affaires and to deliuer vp an account of the gouernement which hee had receyued,The Mareſchall Briſſac going out of Piemōt, leueth Gonner his brother Liuetenant generall. the which his Maieſtie graunted for this cauſe, hauing ſetled all thinges as conuenientlie as he was able hee departed out of Piemont, leauing Gonner his brother the Kinges Liuetenant Generall in his abſence. Being arriued at the Court, &amp; vnderſtanding how ſome bad impreſſions had beene put into the Kinges heade, as well againſt him as ſundry other Gouernours and Captaines in Piemont, he beſought his Maieſttie, hat he would ſende thither to ſift out the matters to the ende, that hee and they might be puniſhed, in caſe they were founde true: and if they were found contrary, that the accuſers might beare the puniſhment, which the accuſed ſhould haue deſerued: to the ende that by this example all falſe accuſers might bee taught. Notwithſtanding his Maieſtie woulde doe nothing, ſaying that hee beleeued no whit at all the accuſers, that he ſhould ſpeake no more thereof, but perſeuer wel &amp; diligentlie to doe him ſeruice. Let vs leaue the Mareſchall at the Courte, to looke backe into the olde purſuites which they began to renew againſt the Lutheranes, for expiation of the deſaſtre and miſfortune of S. Quentins.
            
            As the managing of forraine affayres, doeth ordinarily breede a careleſſenes amonge men at home, the great ones bare ſuch an affection to theſe warres, and the Churchmen and iuſtices turned their eye ſo far fixed thereon, for feare leaſt the euent thereof would giue ſome ſhrewde checke to all Fraunce. And beſides they diſpenſed by little and little in ſuch ſorte, with the purſuites of thoſe which had beene accuſed for the euill opinions which they held of the faith, as now a man could not ſee in all places but an incredible number of Lutheranes, to the great diſaduantage of the Catholicques, notwithſtanding any ſeuere ordinances or rigorous puniſhment, which had beene before made againſt them. There was no ſpeech but of the ſecrete aſſemblies which night and day were made in many places,Aſſemblie of Lutherans diſcouered in S Iacques ſtreet in Paris and eſpecially in Paris: where in the end they diſcouered one in S. Iacques ſtreete, right ouer againſt the Colledge of Pleſsis. Many ſaued themſelues, yet ſome were ſlayne in their owne defence, and a great number remained there of priſoners, of all ſexes, ages, and qualities, the women were the vnchoifed, beaten, and railed at in all ſortes. Among whom the Ladies Douartie, de Rentigny and de Champaigne, with miſtreſſe Graueron de Guienne, neere S. Foy were priſoners. De Grauelles a younge aduocate in Parlement, Clinet a ſchoolemaiſter, renowned for his knowledge, and ſundry other to the number of ſixe ſcore were taken, and clapt faſt in holde, afterwardes theſe two with Graueron hauing their tongue cut out becauſe they ſhold not ſpeake, were burned together in the place Maubert,
               Lutherans puniſhed. and a number of other in ſundrye other places. Certaine daies after Graueron his confiſcation was begged, and obtayned by the Marqueſſe of Trans, ſonne in Lawe to Bertrandie, keeper of the great Seale. But theſe Ladies after long detayning were reſtored to their husbandes, cleane contrary to them in religion, and the widowe D'ouartie was ſent backe to the Queene: for this cauſe ſundry Articles were added as then to the former, aſwell againſt theſe aſſemblies, as agaynſt bookes brought from Geneua: and they began a freſh a newe purſuite agaynſt the people, giuing out that they aſſembled by night together, and hauing put the candels out, each man adreſſed himſelfe to her that liked him beſt, to abuſe her at his pleaſure. Vpon theſe proceedinges and perſecutions, about which

there grew a great ſturre betweene the Liuetenant Ciuile, and Criminel of Paris, before which of them the cauſe ſhould bee tryed, Muſnier being the Ciuill, ſhewed himſelfe ſo ſharpe vpon this purſuit, as he tooke the matter vpon him aboue the Criminell, to whome in very deede it ought to haue appertayned. A little before the King hauing beene perſwaded that by ſome fault of obedience in the iudges, or thorough the ſtrife for one an others iuriſdiction, and to auoide the expenſes of the purſuites, how that the Lutheranes were ſo ſore multiplied, and aſſemblies alreadie made by them in publike, ordayned at Compiegne 24. of Iulie. 1557.Ordinances againſt the Lutheranes. 
               That the Eccleſiaſticall Iudges ſhold not be troubled, in the trial, award of proceſſe, or iuriſdictions of any crime of Hereſie. That the royall iudges ſhould hold plea, award Proces and puniſh all Sacramentaries, &amp; diſturbers of the publike repoſe, vpon paine of death. But the confiſcations and fines which ſhould growe vpon their iudgementes, to charitable and publike workes, not to the kinges vſe, who renounceth the giftes and whatſoeuer els might thereby growe vnto him. Shortely after the Prince being as yet further animated by the Churchmen, for the great aſſemblies which the Lutheranes made throughout his whole Realme, eſpecially in Paris, aſwel to celebrate the Supper and other exerciſes of their religion, as to goe a whoaringe ſaid they, and commit other deteſtable actes forbad theſe conuenticles, vpon payne of raiſing the houſes in which they ſhould bee made, to what Lord ſoeuer they were proper, at Vilier Cotteretz the 14. of September, 1559. And for the better confirmation thereof King Francis the ſecond added ſince payne of death, to all ſuch as ſhould bee the authours of ſuch aſſemblies, whether they were made for religion or no, and that as well by day as night, and to all ſuch as ſhould aſſiſt, without hope of euer hauing their houſes builded vp againe: at Blais in the moneth of Nouember 1559. And the 14. of Nouember hee pardoned the diſcloſer thereof, and gaue him for the firſt time one hundred crownes. And afterwardes he willeth in February following, that all Lords Iuſtices ſhall be depriued of their iuſticeſhippes, and the royall officers of their eſtates and offices, which ſhoulde any wayes bee founde negligent in puniſhing of the authours of theſe aſſemblies, with an iniunction to the officers to aduertiſe him of their duetie within on moneth after any ſuch aſſemblie made, and his procters generall, to whome they ſhould ſend the coppie of the information, and other proceedinges thereupon. The Lutheranes in like ſort, to put out of mens heades, eſpecially of the Princes, and Churchmen, ſuch vile conceites as had beene giuen out and imprinted within them, as well of hereſie as of their filthie and lewde behauiours in their aſſemblies, which they made night and day, aduiſed themſelues, to cauſe the articles of their confeſſion of faith, to be preſented vnto the King and publiſhed in all places, and to beſeech his Maieſtie that it might be permitted vnto them to aſſemble themſelues in publike, to the end all men might ſee how they behaued themſelues, offring to yeelde themſelues to any ſuch payne and puniſhment, as it ſhoulde pleaſe him to ordayne, in caſe they were founde of any worſe conuerſation then the reſt of the Chriſtians. There enſued thereof, what you ſhall belowe perceiue.
            Now ſince that all Fraunce, feeling the diſcommoditie of the diſaſtre of S. Quentin, no man could abſtaine from pouring out complaintes, ſome attributing the euill to haue proceeded from the ambition of the one ſide, ſome from the couetouſnes of the other parte, there were enough founde, which imputing the cauſe to ariſe no whit from any man, ſaide that God was the ſole authour thereof, to ſtirre vp the flacknes both of great and ſmall, becauſe they did not their duety in the proſecutinge of the Lutheranes, of whome if Fraunce, nay all Chriſtendome were not in ſhorte ſpace purged, the Kinge himſelfe ought not to expect any other progreſſe of his life,

&amp; managing of his eſtate, then accurſed and reprochfull to his whole poſteritie. In ſomme they ſo animated this Prince, to renew and increaſe the puniſhment of thoſe people,Perſecution of the Lutheranes. that it neuer grewe ſo hot a time for them as then, which not being able to remedie by any ſo earneſt purſuites as by flight, recantation, or diſſimulation, they endeuoured to mollifie the courage of the greater ſorte, ſo hotly enflamed againſt them, by a little writing, wherein they inforced themſelues to proue that all the ſcourges and calamities ſent from God vpon that Realme, proceeded onely from the contempt &amp; corruption of the true worde of God, whereof they perſecuted the true miniſters and executors. Adding in the end ſuch meanes as the King ſhould holde, if he would ſee his Realme happie, with a repoſe agreeable to all his ſubiects, and cleare deliuered from all differentes, which might fall out for the matter of Religion.
            
               
                  THe calamities and afflictions (ſaid they) which poſſeſſe all Chriſtendome, cleane oppreſſed and left deſolate, were ſo great, as euery man confeſſed that they proceeded from the iuſt iudgements of God, and for that men ſuffred ſo many ſortes of hereſies to be hatched forth, as raigne at this preſent. But the miſcheefe was indeede, for that none of them, which had the publicke gouernemente, and to whome it appertained to prouide thereto, did regard with any good iudgement founded vpon the holy Scriptures, who were the Heretickes, and what the true and falſe is, thence to drawe out a true rule &amp; concorde, and that the true office of a King was to giue himſelfe to the knowledge of ſuch differentes, as had done to the good Kinges Ezechias, Ioſias and other. And afterwardes hauing laide downe which were the markes and differences of the true and falſe Religion, it was written in theſe termes. Conſider I beſeech now (Sir) and you ſhall finde, that all afflictions happened vnto you, at ſuch time as you vndertooke to runne ouer thoſe whome you call Lutheranes. When you made your edict of Chaſteaubriant, then did God ſende warre vnto you. But when you cauſed the execution thereof to ceaſe, and as long as you were enemie to the Pope, being gon into Allemaigne for the protection of the Germaine liberty, defended by the Proteſtantes, and afflicted for religion: your affaires proſpered, as your owne hearte coulde wiſh. Contrariwiſe what is happened vnto you ſince that you are ioyned with the Pope, hauing receiued from him a ſworde, which hee ſent vnto you for his protection, and who was the cauſe to make you breake the truce. God hath turned in one inſtant your proſperities, into ſuch afflictions, that they are no leſſe to bee feared vpon your ſelfe then vpon your realme. To what ende is Monſieur de Guiſe his enterpriſe in Italie turned, going to the ſeruice of the enemie of God, with full deliberation to ruine at his returne the valleies of Piemont, to ſacrifice them vnto God as a fruite of his victories. The iſſue hath well ſhewed how that God is able to reuerſe our deliberations, as of late hee did that of Monſieur le Coneſtable at S. Quentins, on S. Laurence day, hauing vowed vnto God that at his returne he would go ruine Geneua, if he obtained the victorie. Afterwardes hauing alledged a number of diuers perticular examples, of marke notwithſtanding, and of all ſortes of eſtates, who (they ſaide) dyed of a ſtrange and extraordinary faſhion, hauing beene ſworne enemies to the Lutheranes, they added. If it pleaſe your Maieſtie well to aduiſe thereof, you ſhall finde that you had no ſooner concluded to runne them ouer, but euen as ſodenly newe troubles were ſtirred vp by your enemies, with whome you haue not beene able to fall to any accorde. The which God hath not permitted, for that the foundation of the peace, was vpon the perſecution which you determined to make of the ſeruantes of God. As alſo the Cardinals haue not beene able by their crueltie, to hinder the courſe of the Goſpell; which hath already taken ſo deepe a roote within your Realme, as if God ſhoulde ſlacke you the bridle to roote them out, you ſhoulde bee as it were a Kinge without ſubiectes
                  
Tertullian very well ſaide that the blood of Martirs was the ſeede of the Goſpell. To take away then al theſe miſcheefes, proceeding from the riches of the Papiſtes, which cauſeth ſo great whoredoms, Sodomies &amp; inceſts, wallowing &amp; nouriſhing thēſelues like ſwine, with idle bellies, the beſt way were to put them again into their former eſtate, as the ancient ſacrificers the Leuites were, to wit without lands &amp; poſeſsions, as an expreſſe commandement therof was giuen to Ioſua. For as long as the ordinaunce of God tooke place and that they were exempt from ambition, the puritie of religion remained in her entier. But when as they beganne to aſpire to principalities, riches, and worldly honoures, then did thoſe abhominations ſwell out which Ieſus Chriſt there founde. Thus was it in the Primitiue Church: for ſhee flowriſhed &amp; remained in puritie, as longe as her miniſters were ſimple, and ſought not their owne greatnes and particular profit, but onely the glory of God. For when as the Popes beganne to tende to a Superintendency, and vſurped the true Domaine of the Empire, vnder a ſhadow of a falſe Donation, they wreſted the ſcriptures, and attributed vnto themſelues that ſeruice which we owe vnto God. Therefore your Maieſtie may with good right ceaſe vpon all their temporalties in a ſound conſcience to imploy them to their true &amp; proper vſe. Firſt to the maintainance of the faithfull miniſters of Gods word, which ſhould be diſtributed amonge them for their nouriture and entertainement as the caſe ſhould require. Secondly to the maintenance of the officers of your Iuſtice. Thirdely to the nouriture &amp; entertainement of Colledges, and to bring vp the youth of the poore to what they ſhould bee moſt apt to be applyed. And for the reſt which is infinite, it ſhould remaine for the maintenaunce of your owne eſtate, conducting of your owne affaires, and comfort of your poore people which onely carieth the burthen, and poſſeſſeth as it were nothing. And in doing this an infinite number of men, and eſpecially of your nobilitie, which now liue of the Crucifix, will imploy themſelues to your ſeruice, and the Commonwealthes, ſo much the more diligently, as they ſhall ſee that you will recompence none but ſuch as ſhall haue deſerued it. For there is neyther Captayne, nor Lorde, which will not thinke himſelfe better recompenſed with a benefite of 500. liuers, then to ſee 1000. to bee giuen vnto his brother, to haue them ſpent in Dogges, and whoares. And there is an infinite number of men within your Realme, which occupie the fayreſt eſtates and offices, and neuer deſerued ought of the common wealth. By this meanes it ſhold be an eaſie matter for your Maieſtie to be ſerued onely by your owne french nation in the warres, according to the aduiſe and councell of the Sieur de Langey. For you ſhall finde but too many men, in whome there ſhalbe more fidelitie, then in ſtrangers, which exerciſe themſelues in warre with your expence, and cary the money cleane out of your Realme. As alſo the ſommes which yow giue yearely for penſions to forrainers, &amp; ſuch as go to Rome euery day for Collations of benefices, which lend that againe to your enemies, to make warre againſt your ſelfe. And in thus doing, all ſhall remaine ſtill in your owne Realme, which thereby will grow rich, opulent, and inuincible. When the Papiſtes doe ſee that they haue no reaſon at all to gaineſay, then doe they aſſay to render ſuch as they call Lutheranes, odious vnto your Maieſty, and tell you (if their ſaying were true) that you ſhould bee made a priuate perſon, and that there neuer happened any change of Religion, but the like enſued of the Gouernment. A matter as falſe, as their accuſing of vs to bee Sacramentaries, and that wee deny the authoritie of Magiſtrates, vnder colour of of ſome furious Anabaptiſtes, which Satan hath ſtirred vp in our time to obſcure the light of the Goſpell. For the hiſtories of the Emperours which firſt began to receiue the Chriſtian religion, &amp; that which is happened in our owne time declare the contrary. Was there 
                        〈◊〉
                      Prince more feared and obeyed then Conſtantine was in receiuing the Chriſtian Religion? Did he therefore abandon the Empire? Nay he was rather ſo much the more confirmed therein, and thoſe of his poſterity which were contented to be guided thereby. For touching thoſe which ſwarued away, and followed mens traditions, God hated them, yea their race is no longer continued vpon the earth, in ſo great horrour doth God hold them which abandon him; be it neuer ſo little.

And in our time the late Kinges of England &amp; Princes of Germany, were they at any tyme conſtrained, in purging away of ſuch ſuperſtitions as the malice of time had brought in, to abandon their kingdomes &amp; principalities? Euery one may cleerly ſee the contrary. And how great honour, obedience, and fidelitie, doe thoſe people beare vnto their Princes, and ſuperiours, which haue receiued the reformation of the Goſpell in our time? Nay I might ſay how that Princes before knew not what it was to bee obeyed, when as the rude and groſſe people woulde eaſily receiue the Popes diſpenſation, to driue out their Princes and naturall Lordes. Did you euer perceiue any of thoſe, whome they call Lutheranes, to tende to any trouble or ſedition, notwithſtandinge the cruell puniſhmentes which they haue endured? I call for this to witnes Monſieur le Mareſhall de Briſſac, if he haue founde within Piemont, any people more obedient, then thoſe of the valles of Angrongne, and the reſt, and when at any time hee laide any charge vpon them, were it neuer ſo hard, if they did not beare it without murmuring. Whereas if they had not held for certaine that Kinges, Princes and Magiſtrates, are ordained of God, they woulde not ſo willingly haue obeyed: but being conſtrayned by force would more ſlackely haue behaued themſelues. The true and onely remedy (Syr) is, that you cauſe a holy and free councell to be held, wherein your ſelfe ſhall proceede, and not the Pope, nor any of his, which ought onely to defend their cauſes by the holie Scriptures. This done according to the example of the good Kinges Iehoſaphat, Ezechias, &amp; Ioſias, you muſt aboliſh out of the Church all kindes of Idolatrie, ſuperſtitions, and abuſes, which ſhall bee founde directly againſt the holie Scriptures, and new Teſtamente: you muſt range your ſelfe together with your people to the true and pure ſeruice of God, without harkenninge any whitte to the Papiſtes ſayinges, that ſuch queſtions haue beene decyded in the ſayde Councelles. For wee knowe well enough, that no Councell hath beene lawfull, ſince that the Popes hauinge vſurped principalitie, and tyranny ouer the ſoules, made them but to ſerue to their owne couetouſnes, ambition and crueltie. And the contrarietie which is founde in them, maketh them to bee ſufficiently diſprooued, with an hundred thouſand other abſurdities againſt the word of God, which are to bee ſeene therein. The true diſproouing of theſe deſciſions is to bee founde in the true and ſacred Scriptures, to which neyther tyme nor age coulde giue any preſcription. For by them wee receyue the Councels founded vpon the worde of God: and by them wee reiect whatſoeuer contrarieth the ſame. And if you doe thus (Sir) God will bleſſe your enterpryſe, hee will encreaſe and confirme your raygne and Empire, and likewiſe your poſteritie: If otherwiſe, the ruine is at your dore, and accurſed is the people which ſhall remaine vnder your obedience. There is no doubt but God will harden your hart, as he did to Pharaoh: take your Crowne from of your heade as he did to Ieroboam, Nadad, Baaſa, Achab, and as many of the reſt of the Kinges as followed mens traditions, contrary to Gods commaundement: and giue you ouer to your enemies, to triumph ouer your ſelfe and your chileren. And if the Emperour Anthonie the gracious albeit hee was a Pagan and idolater, ſeeing himſelfe oppreſſed with ſo many warres, was willinge to cauſe the perſecutions to ceaſe, which in his tyme were made againſt the Chriſtians differinge vntill the ende thereof, to prouide thereunto, and to heare their reaſons howe much more ought you which beare the name of Moſt Chriſtian, to bee carefull and diligent to make theſe perſecutions to ceaſe, againſt the poore Chriſtians, eſpecially conſideringe that they neuer did nor doe trouble, in any kinde of ſorte the eſtate of your Realme, or of your affayres, nor tende to any ſedition or trouble? Conſidering in like ſorte, that the Iewes are ſuffred throughout all Chriſtendome, albeit they are naturall enemies to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt whome wee holde by one common accorde for our God, Redeemer and Sauiour? and vntill you ſhall haue hearde the matter lawfully debated, and alſo vnderſtande our reaſons taken out of the holie Scriptures? And that your Maieſtie of your ſelfe iudge, whether wee bee worthy of ſuch punniſhmente. For if wee bee not conuicted by the worde of

God: fire, ſworde, nor the moſt cruell tormentes in the worlde, ſhall daunte vs no whit at all. They be the exerciſes which God hath promiſed to his, and hath foretolde them, that they muſt happen in the latter time, to the ende they ſtoulde not be troubled, when they ſee ſuch perſecutions to fall out.
               
            
            The chiefer ſorte for all that made no accompte at all of all theſe reaſons, and neuer the whit leſſe ceaſed the Lutherane perſecution, recommended thoroughout all Fraunce.
            Were it that they were not diſcloſed vnto them, or that the Catholicques watred them with ſome other contrary reaſons, which animated them more then euer.
            Let vs leaue then the fires, the bloude, the complaintes, and diſcourſe of the Lutheranes running ouer the whole Realme, and quarters bordering about, to looke backe agayne into the happie, and no leſſe bloudie progreſſe of the deſſeines which the Spanyarde thought to execute ouer the fayreſt of all Fraunce.
            The Prince of Piemont being reſolued in the meane ſpace to continue the Siege of Saint Quenrins, woulde in no eaſe hearken to their aduiſe, which counſelled him, to paſſe forwardes to the purſuite of ſo fayre a Treate: conſidering that Fraunce was altogether daunted, at the loſſe of ſo many of her nobilitie, and good Souldiers: beſides the abſence of the Duke of Guiſe, which had carried into Italie the reſt of the flower of Fraunce: that the Parisſians alreadie trembled, who halfe reſolued to quitte their Towne, woulde cleane abandon it, onely vpon the apparaunce of a ſeconde Baſtonnadade: that in ſumme there wanted no more for him nowe, but courage to preſenre himſelfe in the viewe of ſo riche a Citie, to heape vpon himſelfe the tryumph of an immortall glory.
            He on the contrary parte weighing the vnconſtant varietie of humaine thinges, the moſt aſſured whereof cleane ruyne themſelues by the r'encounter of a much more ſimple accident then one will eaſily beleeue: the riches, the infinite populouſnes of Fraunce, the nomber of Princes and other perſonages of marke eſcaped from the battayle, the thouſandes of men of warre, which were in ſo many Gariſons diſperſed ouer all the Frontires, readie to make vp an other freſhe Armie, againſt his altogether tyred, hauing by the loſſe of ſo many gallaunt men bought his honour, eſteemed it much more ſafe, to blocke in ſtraighter then euer, the Admirall and Dandelot his brother, who was entered in with fiue hundred men onely, of all the ſuccours which the Coneſtable coulde get, as I before tolde you: the ariuall of which encouraged the reſt, who had almoſt quitted all, as ſoone as they percyued ſome of the frenche Enſeignes to ſtande on the toppe of the Spaniſhe Trenches. Whoſe preſence cauſed them to ſuſpecte that, which a fewe ſouldiers,K. Philip commeth for his Armie after the battayle. which were eſcaped and entred in, aſſured them of, eſpecially after the magnificent ſalutation and welcome, which the whole Armie made vnto King Philip, who cauſed the Cannon ſhotte to redouble, hauing brought other from Cambray, with intente to beate Sainte Quentins into powder, or blowe it vp by force of Mines, which they continued there and renewed daye by daye, albeit they were vented often enough by the coutermines of the beſeeged, among whome S. Remy trauayled without ceaſſe, and Lanfort an Engliſhe man, whoſe countermine was more aduaunced then any of the reſt.
            And foraſmuch as the Admirall could not get any great ſeruice of the Inhabitants

and Pioners, he thruſt out ſixe hundred of the moſt idle bellies, whoſe example though in their viewe they ſawe them well beaten and euill intreated by the Spanyardes, coulde for all that little ſtirre them vp, ſo wearie were they, and backward to the perfourmance of their duetie.
            The Fleminges and Spanyardes ariued before Saint Quentins the ſeconde day of Auguſt, and from that day, vntill the one and twentieth, they went about no other worke, then digging and hollowing the Trenches, as well for the ſuretie of the Artillerie, as the better to approache and gayne the Ditches.
            
               The 22. of Auguſt the Spanyardes beganne their great Batterie at S. Quentins.They which were beſieged in the meane ſpace, coulde not greatly annoye them with any ſallie they made vpon them, (as it hath beene tolde you, by reaſon of the ſmall nomber of thoſe which were beſieged, and for that all the ſallies which the Lorde Admirall cauſed to be made, were onely but to take breathe, and to be aduertiſed of what his enemies meant to vndertake: for ſo much as hee doubted leaſt they woulde worke ſome newe Mynes, whereof hee coulde not haue any knoweledge at all.
            That daye, as ſoone as euer it beganne to breake, they ſaluted the Towne, with a full Batterie. For all the ſhotte that had beene before, came from the platfourme of the Fauxbourg D'Iſle, whence they ſawe them worke and countermine, continuing the playe of the Cannon, all the whole day long, and not at one onely place, not much of the night paſſing ouer, but that they ſtill remooued their Pieces from one place to another, to make a newe batterie. For from the ſeconde day, they beganne to digge and carrie forth the earth of the Ditche on their ſide, and ſhortly after they propped vp coueringes with great Timber, vnder which they mought trauerſe to and fro, and enter within the Ditches, without any man beeing able to doe them harme. Becauſe there were not any Flanckers at all to commaunde the Ditch, where they mought eyther viewe, or laye batterie vnto them. And all the ſtones which they were able to fling at them, coulde not endammage them, by reaſon of the coueringes, vnder which they creapte.
            They began their Batterie at the Windemyll, which was neare vnto Saint Iohns gate, and afterwardes ſcowred this place, as farre as the Tower on the water, with ſuch a furie, that there was not lefte one ſole Tower, which was not rent and razed, with the better parte of the Courtayne, laying the Batterie in diuerſe places with fiue and fourtie Peeces.
            All thoſe which were within were greatly couſined, and deceyued in one thing, that they thought the Maſons worke and Cyment of the towres and courtines much more ſtronger and better then it was, the ſteares and thickneſſe of the walles being very large. But the ſtuffe was ſo naught, that as ſoone as the toppe was but a little ſhaken and looſed, all the reſt fell downe of it ſelfe in great lumpes, whereby many were ſlayne and hurte with the creſtes and battlementes of the Parapettes.
            On the 4 day of their Batterie, they carried twelue peces alongeſt the ſide of Bourg D'Iſle, and mounted them within the Abbey, from whence they battered the gate where the fire was put into powder, vntill they had made themſelues Maiſters of the Ditches. S. Remy ſtill well hoped to haue perfourmed ſome matter of worthe, but when he ſawe them once lodged within, he tolde the Admirall, that he was not able to doe them any more harme, for that they had gotten the vpper grounde of him: Reiterating many times, that he neuer ſet his foote in ſo badde a place, and that long before that, hee had aduertiſed the late King thereof. Not for that he was the more

diſmayed thereat, or ſpoke of any puſillanimitie, but angrie, for that hee founde no remedie at all, nor ſuch meanes as he coulde haue wiſhed, being for the reſt a man very reſolute and wiſe. From the very firſt day of the Batterie, vntill the ende thereof, the Admirall, D' Andelot, and S. Remy, went euery night to viewe the damages, and onvertures which the Artillerie had made, and on the day reſolued with thoſe Captaynes of the Quarters whome it concerned, of that which they had to execute.
            After that the Batterie had continued foure dayes, there was a great feare engendred among thoſe of the Towne, yea and the men of Warre themſelues, which the Admirall getting knowledge of, walking by night to remedie the ſame, hee helde one language common and generall to them all, in a place, where almoſt all the Captaines, and many ſouldiers were aſſembled together, which was, that hee had firmely agreed, and reſolued in his minde, to keepe that place with thoſe men which he had, and if any man did at any time ſee him varie, or offer any ſpeache of compoſition, hee gaue him leaue to throwe him downe as a cowarde into the Ditches: and in like caſe, if he founde any of them to parley to the contrary, he woulde doe no leſſe by them. And by this occaſion there neuer paſſed ouer daye, but two or three times hee woulde walke himſelfe about the quarters, and in paſſing by, would demaunde the Captaines opinions, conferring and communicating with them, what was done in the reſt of the places: according vnto that which hee had prayed them, the firſt day that he entred within the Towne, that euery man woulde aduertiſe him, of that which he eſteemed beſt for the conſeruation of the place. The batterie continued vntill the ſixte daye, about two of the clocke in the afternoone, that they likewiſe preſented themſelues in ſundry places within the ditches, as farre as the Parapettes at a pikes leangth.
            At this preſente, the Sentinell from the ſteeple of the great Churche, aduertiſed the Admirall, howe that of all handes the Armie raunged themſelues into battaile, and that many footemen martched towards the Trenches. The which he cauſed to be made knowne, in all places and quarters of the Towne, to the ende that euery man might ſtande vpon his guarde, imagining that they meant that day to giue the aſſaulte, and he himſelfe wente to three of the nexte breaches vnto him, to ſee what order was there kept. Where hee founde euerie man in all apparaunce willing to perfourme his duetie, the like whereof he alſo vnderſtoode from all the reſt of the places, whither he had ſente Gentlemen to viewe. Which was the cauſe that himſelfe returned backe agayne verie well content to the Breache. Which he kept, being that which he ſuppoſed the enemies meante to turne their principalleſt ſtrength againſt: for that they euer moſt ſought to batter this place, &amp; to leaue nothing which might ſerue for Flanckes, eſpecially for that it laye iuſt ouer againſt the entrie, which they had made into the Ditche.
            As they were all thus attending the aſſaulte, the enemies put fire to three mines, all which were right vnder the Rampire, the principalleſt were in the quarter of D' Auphin. But the dammage was nothing ſo great as they looked for, being the cauſe that they gaue no aſſaulte that day. So afterwardes they did not ouermuch heate them ſelues, but were contented to goe and viewe the breaches on the Admirals ſide, and deſcende into the Ditche which D' Andelot kept.
            After that the Spanyardes were retyred, the Admirall wente to viewe what hurte thoſe Mines had made, and founde, that by that onuerture, they were not very

like to receyue or incurre any great danger, but that for all that, it was fitte to worke vpon it, which hee deferred vntill night, for that they durſte not touche there, or ſhewe themſelues by day, by reaſon of the full viewe, which their enemies Artillerie had of them.
            
               The great aduantages of the Spaniardes and ſmall means which the Frenche had to endure the ſiege.Nowe were there eleauen breaches, many mines, the ditche gayned, and the Souldiers therein well couered, the Armie great to gayne the breaches, againſt eight hundred ſouldiers, and men at armes of all ſorts, diſtributed as the Admirall thought good, the countermines little auaileable, becauſe that the Spanyarde being in the Ditche, had alreadie gayned the toppe, moſt of the ſouldiers wauering, as well for that day by day they ſawe the Cannon ſhotte redouble, to the loſſe of many of them, as thorough the ſmall number of people, which were lefte, and the badde handling of the matter by the Inhabitantes, which diſcouraged them as much as was poſſible. Hereupon the Prince of Piemont iudging the breaches reaſonable, gaue order for the aſſaultes. The firſt was giuen to Captaine Cazeres, Maiſter of the Campe of the olde Spaniſhe bandes, and to Lazare Colonell of fiueteene hundred Almaines, who were there much endamaged. The ſeconde to Captaine Nauarres with the Spaniardes, and the Compte of Meigue, with the Wallons. The thirde to Captaine Iulian Romero with three Enſeignes of Spaniardes, &amp; two thouſande Engliſhe, who falling downe from the toppe of a breache, brake his legge. The fourth to Captayne Carrondellette with three Enſeignes of Bourguignons, who there loſte a hande. The Admirall in the meane time went and ſent to all places, to the ende euery man ſhoulde be readie to abide thē, &amp; put them backe. At the laſt he diſcouered three Enſeignes at the foote of the Parapet, being gotten vp thither, without making any noyſe or ſounde of Dromme, at which time he made euery man preſente himſelfe to fight. But they coulde not repreſſe them in that place, but that they beganne to creepe and mounte vp by one and one to an high Tower, which had bene battered with Artillerie, at a corner of the Captayne La Garde his quarter. When the Admirall ſawe that they tooke that waye, hee was very glad, for there they grapeled and mounted verie vneaſily, and from the place where himſelfe ſtoode he mought a little diſcerne them thorough a Flancker, whereby he annoyed them as much as he was able with three harquebuſiers, which remayned with him, thinking verily, that it was vnpoſſible for them to force in that way. In the ende he ſawe thoſe Enſeignes which went vp to the top of the towre, put themſelues downe, but he preſumed that it was within ſome Trenche within the Parapet, to be more at couerte, vntill they tolde him, that the enemies had forced the Breache. Then turning himſelfe towardes thoſe which ſtoode about him, he tolde them, that they muſt goe helpe to ſuccour it.
            Vpon that Saragoſſe comming vnto him, asked him, whether he woulde goe, and what he would doe: to whom he aunſwered, that he meant to goe helpe to ſuſtaine the force of the Breache, which ſhoulde be offered, where eyther they muſt all dye, or put backe the enemie. And thereupon hee beganne to goe downe from off the Rampire.
            Nowe you muſt vnderſtande, that he was not as then farre from the Towre, by which the Spanyardes entred, but there was a long trauerſe and a high, which hindered them from ſeeing what was done there.
            The Admirall being come downe from off the Rampire, hee ſawe all that quarter cleane abandoned, without ſo much as one man to make head, by reaſon, ſayde they, that kept that guarde, that they were not able to hinder the comming of the aſſailante, it being not poſſible to deſcrie or perceyue them, vntill they were come

to the breache, in ſuch ſorte as the Spanyardes aryuing there in aboundance, and calling vp one an other, it was an eaſie matter to make them ſelues Maiſters, finding no perſon to make reſiſtaunce.
            The Admirall onely accompanyed with foure, whereof one was a Page, and going to gather together his Troupes and make head, as ſoone as he was there ariued, ſawe himſelfe enwrapped of all partes. Knowing then howe that it reſted no more in his power to remedie this diſorder, the Towne being alreadie full of ſouldiers, the Almaines entring in by great Troupes, hee fought as much as hee was able to fall into the handes of ſome Spanyarde, as it rightly chaunced vnto him, choſing rather in that place, to abide the brunte of a common generall fortune, and all ſucceſſe, eyther good or badde, then by flying away to attayne an immortall ſhame. He which tooke him priſoner, made him a while to repoſe himſelfe at the foote of the Rampire, where he was all aloane, hauing loſte all his Forces: from thence hee ledde him, and made him to enter into one of the Mines, which hee had made to gayne the Ditche, where hee founde at the entrie thereof, the Captaine Alonce de Cazieres, Mayſter of the Campe, of the olde Spaniſhe bandes, to which place the Prince of Piemont ariued incontinently, and commaunded Cazieres to carrie him into his Tente.
            Thus was that fayre and riche Towne of S. Quentins conquered on the ſeauen and twentie daye of Auguſt, 1557. in which they founde great booties,The Towne of S Quentins very riche and full of great booties. and mightie riches, in that it was the Staple of ſundrye Marchaundiſes, which were tranſported into the Lowe Countries, and likewiſe brought from thoſe places thither, thorough the entercourſe of trade and traficque. Without comprehending beſides many good Priſoners, which they founde there, as well of thoſe of the Towne, as of ſuch other chiefe Perſons and Captaynes, as were come in for the defence thereof. D' Andelot was likewiſe there taken: but well remembring the badde entertainement which he had receyued at their handes during his impriſonment in Italy, hee choſe rather to aduenture his life, in ſeeking to eſcape, then to fall agayne an other time into that calamitie and miſerie. In ſuch ſorte, as he crept vnder the faſteninges of a Tente, and by night hauing ſounded diuers paſſages within the Marſhes, hee founde meanes to eſcape their watches, and Corps de guardes, and ſaued himſelfe at Han.
            
               De Iarnac was there taken Priſoner, ſo were S. Remy, De Humes, De la Guarde, De Cuzieux, De Moulins, the Captaines Brueile and Bretaigne, De Rambouillet, Saint Romain, Saint Andre, Lignieres, and Soleil.
            
            There were ſlayne there, the ſonne of La Fayette, the Captaine Salleuert, Enſeigne to La Fayette his Companie, the Captaynes Oger, Vignes, La Barre, L'Eſtang, Gourdes, with ſundrie other.
            After the Sacke of Saint Quentin,Meanes of well employing an Armie. King Philip making no outwarde apparaunce of his intention, cauſed the King and the Duke of Neuers his Lieutenaunt generall to prepare for all occurrentes the beſt that they were able: and eſpecially to prouide for ſuch places as were neareſt to that which was taken. But as he was earneſtly ſollicited to this effecte, by euery Gouernour, to ſende ſuch prouiſions as were requiſite, they were all aſtoniſhed at the yeelding vp of Caſtelet, which a fewe dayes before the taking of Saint Quentins, the Compte of Aremberge otherwiſe called Brabanſon, encloſed about in one inſtaunte with a thouſande horſe, all alongeſt the mariſhe, and towardes Saint Martins Abbey: a little aboue which were encamped three Regimentes of Lanſquenettes of fourteene Enſeignes, with twentie peeces of

Batterie planted in two places.
            And albeit that the aſſurance, which the Baron of Solignac who commaunded there, had yeelded to the King and his Lieutenaunte, cauſed them to repoſe on that ſide, whileſt that they haſted forwardes the Swizers and Almaines, the Frenche Fanterie and Cauallerie, to furniſhe out the Rende-vous, ſo as within fiueteene dayes they mought make vp the fourme of an Armie, yet euen in the very beginning of September it yeelded vp. The which was founde very ſtraunge, conſidering that the place was ſtrong, and well prouided of all that was neceſſarie to a Frontire: at the leaſt it was looked for, that they ſhoulde haue tarryed the Aſſaulte. An occaſion that the King cauſed him to be clapped vp Priſoner as ſoone as hee was come to Paris.
            But hee was ſet at libertie, declaring howe hee had beene diſappoynted of ſuch neceſſarie Succoures as hee required, of two thouſand men, in ſuch ſorte as D'Eſtre the Gouernour in former time had vpon any Siege. Beſides that, the enemies hauing founde the Caſtle without any ditche, on that ſide where they beganne their principall Batterie, and a Baſtion fallen downe not yet repayred vp, in ſuch ſorte behaued themſelues, as that the ordinarie ſouldiers of the Guarde of that Baſtion, were ſoone conſtrained to abandon it, thorough the great quantitie of Bricke and mould which endamaged them, and ordinarily fell vpon them: the Batterie beeing ſo violent and furious, as in a ſmall ſpace it made a waye for a horſe to be able to get vp vpon the Baſtion, the waye lying all open to come from thence to the breache, which albeit it was not altogether ſufficient, waxed wyder within two volleyes of the Cannon, and enlarged it ſelfe ſixe ſcore pace, or more, the Wall alreadye bowyng and yeelding of the ſame length, and the earth opening a pace in breadth, and in deapth the length of a pike.
            Which the Souldiers once perceyuing, who were not in the whole nomber three hundred, nor halfe of them in health and ſtrength, they were ſo aſtoniſhed, and deſpayred, that notwithſtanding any perſwaſions which the Captaynes coulde vſe, many ſtucke not to ſaye, they woulde not fight at all, not knowing howe they were able to doe the King any Seruice therein, and therefore they thought it better to reſerue themſelues for ſome matter of greater importaunce.
            Howeſoeuer it was, whether grounded or no vpon the feare which they conceaued the Frenche were in, leaſt that the Imperialles woulde purſue further their good fortune, and duetie againſt ſuch an inconuenience, King Philip, to whome the beſiegers of the Caſtelet, came to vnite themſelues at Fon-Some, attended their aunſwere of his aduertiſement from the Emperour his Father, to congratulate with him his proſperitie, beſeeching him further to commaunde and ordayne what next hee was to enterpriſe.
            But as a blade ruſteth if it be let lie continually within the ſheathe, ſo the ſouldier which is not employed, doeth lightly abuſe his reſt. For the Almaines and Spanyardes quickely mutined among themſelues for the bootie of Saint Quentins, and raunſome of the priſoners which were taken the day of the Battaile: ſome alleadging among other occaſions, howe that King Philip and the Duke of Sanoye ſought to retyane all the great priſoners which exceeded a certayne ſumme, of purpoſe to pulle them out of the handes of the Almaine Lordes, who without all doubte atchieued the greateſt honour of the Battayle, ſo farre forth, as they were all readie to departe, the rather for that the time of their oath was now expired. An occaſiō the french did

turne the matter to their owne aduantage, withdrawing out of that nation as many malcontents as they could finde vpon any occaſion whatſoeuer. Hereupon the Spaniarde addreſſed himſelfe to Han, to erect a ſtronge place vpon the frontiere, which might ſerue for a ſuccour and ſupport to S. Quentins, the which hee determined to make impregnable, according vnto ſuch models as the enioyners had preſcribed vnto him, thereby to eſtabliſh from his lowe countries eaſie daies iourneyes of retreat, when he would either goe in or come out of Fraunce, as it ſhoulde ſeeme beſt vnto him. Now as vpon new occurrents alwaies proceed new determinations, the D. of Neuers being conſtrained to chaunge the eſtate and imagination of his defenſiue, retired his men of warre from ſundry garriſons, which he had into ſuch places as were neereſt vnto Han, to the ende that the imperials ſhoulde not inlarge themſelues into any greater a compaſſe, likewiſe to the ende they might alwaies waſt the country before them, and famiſh them by cutting of their victuailes on all ſides, the french had deuiſed to make a remouing Campe, which for this effect they might encloſe and aſſure with trenches, Paliſſades and other Romane inuentions: but the longe delay of their prouiſions and ſoddanes and their enemies cleane broke of this determination. The Cheualier Hely, with a number of horſe entred within the place to ſuccour it, running ouer as many enemies as durſt ſtoppe the paſſages of Han, which hee found open without any thinge to commaande it beinge flankerde on the one ſide with the Riuer of Some, and on the other with a Mariſh, being in diuers places aboue one hundred thouſande paces broade, hauing very little firme or drie grounde to bee able to ſet foote vpon. There is a village and a Caſtle, the village in the ſtate which it was then in was not able to holde out in any kinde of ſorte: and albeit that there were certaine foundations and faſhions of bulwarkes, yet they were ſo open and euill to bee defended, as that there was no account at all to bee made thereof. The Caſtle was of a goodly ſhewe, and repreſented it ſelfe furious enough,Deſcription of the ſituation of Han. according to the olde fortifications, beeing in forme ſquare, flankerde with fower rounde bulwarkes, with a groſſe ſquare towre, and maſſiue, of a large thicknes, ſeruing for a platforme to the Courtines, which were ioyned vnto it, and commaundinge in all and through all the Caſtle. But the whole was of drye ſtones and Maſons worke, without any rampiers of earth, or other fortifications, according to the moderne inuentions to ſuſtaine &amp; defend a place long time, againſt the bluſterouſnes and furie of our Cannons. Notwithſtanding that the way might not bee altogether open and free to the Spaniarde, to enter further in if he found not a ſtoppe, Sepois which was Gouernour, had giuen the Kinge aduiſe to burne the towne, in caſe ſeege were laide vnto it, whereby the enemie might haue no place to lodge in. But as for the Caſtle, men might holde and keepe it for a fewe dayes whileſt that they ſhoulde bee the better able to fortefie themſelues: for it was eaſie to iudge that hauing taken Han, hee woulde neuer ende there, but paſſe on further, where he might caſt himſelfe nowe on the right hande, and nowe on the lefte, and ſo daylie addreſſe himſelfe to ſuch places as were weake and likely in a ſhorte time to be caried, to the ende he might not loſe and euill employ the ſeaſon; which ſerued ſo fitte and proper for him.
            I haue let you to vnderſtande, how that to bee meete with the inconueniences of the battell of Saynte Quentins, among other preparatiues the Kinge had ſent vnto the Duke of Guiſe, that after that hee had to his beſt aduauntage accorded with the Pope, and the Spaniardes, hee ſhoulde bringe awaye the Armye into Fraunce with as much ſpeede as were poſſible. This Prince ſodenlie let the

Pope to vnderſtand thereof, and made him priuie of the neceſſity which called him backe into Fraunce, and how his Princes affayres went. Beinge the cauſe which made him to beſeech his holines to licenſe him, and permit him to retyre, after ſuch time notwithſtanding as he had compounded to his owne profit the eſtate of his affaires. The Pope then being alredy deſirous to ende this warre, from which hee knewe that on the other ſide to bee proceeded as hee ſawe it euidently, and doubted leaſt it woulde take ende with the ruine of one of theſe Princes, and finally with his owne, together with a confuſion of the Eccleſiaſticall eſtate, and infinitnes of other miſcheefes, purpoſed more then before, to bee agreed with Kinge Philip, which wrought that ende, whereof I before made mention. So as the peace beinge concluded and publiſhed with all magnificence on Sonday being the 19. of that moneth the Duke of Alua entred into Rome, about one of the clocke in the after noone, with great apparances of ioy, aſwell by the ſalutations of the artillarie, as an infinite number of ſquibs, and other merimentes, which they are accuſtomed to make eſpecially in thoſe parts, at the welcome and amiable entertainement of any great Prince. The Monday following they helde Conſiſtorie, where there were choſen &amp; deputed two Legates, to intreate of an vniuerſall peace. The one which was the Cardinall of Tiuoli, towardes the moſt Chriſtian Kinge of France, and the other which was the Cardinall Carlo Caraffe, towardes the Catholique King Philip.
            
            The Duke of Guiſe in the meane ſpace departed out of Italie, to take his way into Fraunce,The Duke of Guiſes departure and to imbarke himſelfe at Oſtia in the gallies &amp; french veſſels which attended him with a ſorte of Lordes, Captaines, and two thouſande harquebuſiers, the other parte of the Armye vnder the conducte of the Duke D' Aumalle, returned through the Popes lands towardes Bologne and Ferrara, and ſo from thence they paſſed all for the moſt parte through the Griſons and Zuizers into Fraunce, where the Duke of Guiſe beinge arriued was ſodenly ſent for to addreſſe an armie at Compienne. At which place the Kinge being anone after arriued, declared (all ſuch as were then in Courte beeing preſent,) howe that the Duke of Guiſe was come iumpe for the preſeruation of his Realme, and it was propoſed to treate him Viceroy of Fraunce. But this title beinge thought ſtrange, it was commaunded that letters ſhoulde bee diſpatched to make him Lieuetenante Generall ouer all the Countries within his obedience.The Duke of Guiſe made Liuetenant Generall by the K. ouer all his countries. The which were diſpatched by Du Thier ſecretarie of the Commaundementes, and afterwardes receyued and verified by the Parlamente of Paris, and other ſoueraigne Courtes of the Realme: whereof notwithſtanding ſhortely after the Kinge excuſed himſelfe towardes his Goſhip, (ſo he named the Conſtable) ſendinge him worde by ſecreate Letters that hee was conſtrained to doe as hee did,K. H. 2. letters to the Conſtable being priſoner. and that hee ſhoulde not bee greeued for ought, in that hee ſtill reſerued his place for him, for he was ſo farre off, from hauing the frendſhippe which hee boare vnto him any wayes cooled through his abſence and captiuitie: that contrariwiſe it inflamed him the more, ſo farre as that hee moſt diligently aduertyſed him of all his ſecreteſt affayres, without communicating ought gently aduertyſed him of all his ſecreteſt affayres, without communicating ought to any other. Whereof Kinge Philip being aduertyſed, knew well enough how to make his profit as you ſhall ſee elſe where.
            In this ſame tyme there happened in like ſorte, ſtraunge floudes, and inundations of Riuers at Rome, and likewiſe at Florence. That at Rome fell out the ſame day of the peace, beeing the fourteenth of September, Tiber, one of the moſt renowned Riuers of Europe, which ſome notwithſtandinge number amonge the ſwift ſnowie ſtreames being greatly ſwelled, as though it woulde threaten Rome

with great ruines, encreaſinge howrely for the night followinge it began to inlarge it ſelfe ouer all the lowe groundes, of the medowes and vineyardes rounde about. The next day it being encreaſed and broken in throughout the towne, all the channels and gutters of the ſtreetes and houſes ſtanding full, the depth thereof was found in ſome places of the towne of the height of a man, and more in the place D'Agone, A la Roconde and A la Doan
                     •
                  . So farre was this meruelous and dreadfull inundation, from giuing leaſure to the people to reioyce at this peace, as that it made them more aſtoniſhed and deſolate then before, which cauſed a number to thinke that it happened as a ſigne and aduertiſement from God, eyther for matters preſent or to come, or rather to moue vs to a conuerſion and amendement of our ſinnes. Nowe this furie of the water endured all that day and vntill foure of the clocke at night, that it began a little to ebbe and decreaſe, ſo as by the next morning at breake of day,Signes ſerue for admonitions from God it was ebbed more then a ſhaftemente, and then by little and little decreaſing, euery man in the afternoone might eaſily goe about this buſines. The depth of the water, as ſome haue ſaide, in many places exceeded the marke which was left at the other inundation in the yeare 1530. Others were of opinion that it wanted an handbredth. Whereupon they alleadged many reaſons, among other that the Caues which were made and coured within Rome (for it is augmented in buildinges a third parte) had receiued and ſwallowed vp a great parte of the water, Some iudged that the great number of newe ſtreetes was a cauſe of the depth, and other affirmed howe that the earth which was rayſed vp ſince that time, cauſed it ſeeme higher then it was. But they which iudged it to bee the greateſt, ſay that it fell out ſo, for that in the towne of Horta and Narin, and all other places where it paſſed alongeſt, it left behinde it a great abatement and ruine of houſes: hauing caried away halfe the bridge of Saint Marie, together with the excellent chappell which Pope Iulie the thirde cauſed to bee builded there: it vndermined and remoued certaine great peeces of marble,Ruines cauſed at Rome by the floode. &amp; great quarters of ſtone which defended the bridge of Saint Ange. It rayſed and renuerſed a great parte of the bulwarkes and baſtions which they had cauſed to bee builded a yeare ſince ioyning to the Caſtle. Beſides that it threwe downe halfe the Temple, and moſt parte of the buildinges of Saint Barthlemewes monaſterie ſeated in the Ilande of Tiber. Briefely, there was not within all Rome, either pallace or building, alongeſt which this furious rage of waters had paſſed, which carried not ſome marke and teſtimonye of the wrath and violence of this angrie Element. As touching that of Florence by the breaking forth of the Riuer Arno, men iudged it farre greater then that at Rome,Deſcription of the floude at Florence. and to haue occaſioned farre more incomparable and important loſſes as well in ouerthrowing of houſes, as in the deſtruction and periſhing of golde, ſiluer, marchandiſes and other ſortes of moueables, beſides which is more to bee lamented, the death and ſuffocation of many perſons. It firſt ruined and ouerturned for the greatteſt parte the Conuents and monaſteries of the pore maidens of Sainte Verdiane, of the Kecluſes, and of Saint Mary Nouelle. It caried cleane away the bridges of Rubaconde, and La Trinite. It threw downe almoſt the whole borough of Oquo 
                  •
               anti, as farre as the Medowe, and on the ſide of Sainte Paule, as it likewiſe did the newe market place, where they exerciſe the Arte and occupation of ſkening and twiſting of ſilke. In ſuch ſorte as all the ſtore houſes and ſhoppes were for the moſt parte ruined, beinge a meruellous loſſe. The Dukes pallace was no whit exempted, but was founde ſpoyled in a number of places. As touching the region bordering rounde about

the high way to Cazenſin, it was ſo deepe and ouerflowne in ſuch a manner, as it coulde very hardely bee repayred to bee made paſſable, and in the borough there dyed ſeuentie and foure perſons, carying the houſes cleane to Pontaſienco and there remayned cleane ſunke. Pereolle, and Saynte Douin, with many other buildinges all alongeſt the floode Arno.
            Moreouer to ſpeake of the depth of the water vpon the place of Saint Croix, it exceeded foure good fingers in depth the inundation which happened at Florence in the yeare one thouſande fiue hundred forty and ſeuen: which made men iudge the latter to bee very great conſideringe that the former was almoſt vncredible. It was the height of one fadome and a halfe at Saynt Croix: in ſuch ſorte as the loſſe was ſo great and generall, as the Duke remitted to his ſubiectes for a certayne tyme, the moſt parte of his taxes, and ſubſidies, which otherwiſe were very great.
            
               Flood at Niſmes in Languedoc.At the ſame time, there happened in like ſorte, on this ſide, an other floode at the towne of Niſmes in Languedoc, differinge notwithſtanding from the reſt, in that it was not by the breaking out of any floudes or riuers, but by the powring downe of the cloudes, and opening of the gates of heauen, (as the Philoſophers were wonte to terme it) the which accident befell the ninth of September in the ſame yeare, together with ſo feareful thunderings, flaſhes &amp; lightnings as al the people verily immagined that that wold haue been the very laſt day of their life, this celeſtiall furie laſtinge vntill it was paſt eyght of the clocke at night, beſides that, there fell from elſe where ſo meruelous and great an aboundaunce of water, as theſe miſerable and wretched Cittizens thought that together with their whole towne, they ſhoulde haue beene ſunke and ſwallowed vp. And albeit that it laſted not long, but about ſome twelue or fifteene houres, yet notwithſtandinge it did greatly endemnifie and hurte the towne which was in very many romes and places diſformed thereby, and the territoryes thereaboutes greatly waſted and empoueriſhed: for that the fieldes and places of tillage were maruelouſly couered with ſtones and other ruines, ſuch as the rage of waters driueth alongeſt, and leaueth at ſuch time as the force and violence thereof diminiſheth, and the Oliue trees (wherewith this Prouince much aboundeth with great care of trimming them for the great profite, which is drawne thereby through the oyle) were all bruſed and broken, and the Vines clungd together and full of ſande, with an infinite number of other dammages and calamities. Briefely many men thought that there was not almoſt any thing which felt not the waight of Gods wrathfull hand in this flood.
            Hereby then were diſcouered ſundrie antiquities, hidden and buried vnder grounde, at the leaſt ſince the Gottes ſacked and rayzed this towne, a thouſande yeares agonne, as well appeared, howe longe before vnknowne: as aunciente ſepulchers and Monumentes, great quantity of meddalles in copper, and ſome of golde and ſiluer, longe pillars of one peece equally proportioned, teſtaments, Epitaphes written in harde ſtone, and grauen in peeces after the Romaniſquo. There were diſcouered likewiſe fayre and rich pauementes, and floors of lowe parlers, chambers and ſhoppes, wherein were founde tables of marble, Porphir, &amp; Iaſper, wrought a la Moſaque: beſides there were founde many fragmentes of ancient diſhes, and ſome entire, of a redde earth, ſo paſſing fine, and ſleake, that it caryed his owne verniſhe: the which men in aunciente time cauſed to bee brought

from farre Countries, eſpecially from Samos in Greece, enriched with ſtories, or clownes reſemblances very pleaſante. Many other ſingularities were there vnterred and brought to light, with great meruaile to as many as ſawe them. Sundrie other places of Europe were likewiſe touched with the ſame miſchiefe and calamitie, as numbers of celeſtiall ſignes, ſuch as the Comet of the yeare before, pillars of fire, and in ſome places hunting of dogges, crying in the ayre, and ſome men fighting, and two ſunnes, red and inflamed, ſuch as were ſeene in Almaine: beſides many other prodigious and monſtrous workes, which nature brought foorth in that time, vpon the earth, all which ſignes coulde not bee adiudged to bee any other thing then threatninges and meſſengers of the celeſtiall wrath, which ſhoulde warne vs eyther to a voluntarie acknowledginge of our ſinnes, and amendemente of our liues, or aſſure vs of a vengeance at hande, and puniſhmente of our iniquities.
            To returne to the ſiege of Han,Han battered &amp; taken by King Philip. it had no ſooner endured twelue hundred cannon ſhotte together, which made a reaſonable breach; as well at the great Tower, as the Courtyne, the walles being there drye without rampiers and baſtions, but it was yeelded and giuen ouer into the handes of Kinge Phillip, the twelft daye of the moneth of September. Afterwardes hee remayned there a while, to aduaunce and ſet forwarde the fortifications which were alreadie begunne, addinge thereto as much as was ſuppoſed to haue beene forgot. And whileſt that the Baron of Poleuille, hauing beene ſente by Kinge Phillip at his departure from Sauerne, aduaunced forwarde to ioyne himſelfe in Champaygne, with twenty Enſignes of Almaines, and twelue hundred horſe, occupyinge himſelfe in the places borderinge about hee ſent to ſeaſe all the ſtronge places remayning in the handes of the Frenche, which were any wayes able to annoye the garriſon. Then cauſing a number of horſemen furniſhed after the French faſhion to enter in, hee ſurpriſed Noyon,Noyon ſurpriſed by diſguiſing of rayments and the companies of light horſe of the Baron of Clere, and one of the Scottiſhe, vpon whome they entred at fayre day, the gates being open, from thence they ſeaſed vpon Chauny, where they placed a ſtronge garriſon, not for to fortifie it, conſidering the imperfection of the place, and howe it was to bee commaunded two ſeuerall wayes, but onely that thereby they might the more eaſilie gather the Vines: the vineyardes thereaboutes being very good and of great compaſſe.
            Likewiſe to fauour the conduct of all other kinde of victualles wherewith they mente to furniſhe Han, Saynte Quentins, and Le Caſtellet, which they fortified amayne: beſides the great eaſance of the better Milles which ſtoode vpon the Riuer. Thus fortifying theſe two places, they paſſed ouer the moneth of September, and beginning of October, in roades, pilfryes, and burninges, as well on the one ſide as the other, ſtill weakening notwithſtandinge Philips Armie, as well through the Engliſhe mens returne home malcontentes, for want of their booties, and euill entertainemente, as in reſpect of the Almanes, who their oath being nowe expired retyred day by daye to the Duke of Neuers, who furniſhed with them his bandes, that were not compleate, and erected newe ones of the ſurpluſage.
            The Kinge in the meane ſpace haſtened forwardes his armie,The diligence of the D. of Neuers at Compienne. and to aſſemble it together at Compienne, ſente thither the Duke of Neuers, who ſpeedily employed himſelfe to the makinge that ſtronge and defenſable, adding to the naturall all arte poſſible, for that neceſſarily, and as it then ſtoode it ſerued for a frontire

to Fraunce firſt cauſing two large fortes to bee myſed, with high and fayre platformes, the one to commande ouer all the plaine, which lieth betweene the forreſt and the towne, and the other ouer all the lowe grounde, and courſe of the riuer, and alongſt the medowe, employing beſides all diligence to repaire the towne, flankerde with baſtions, cazemates, tarreſſes, caualliers, and trauerſes, in ſuch ſorte as in caſe the enemies artillarie had arriued there, they ſhoulde haue founde play for alonge ſeaſon: moreouer, he cauſed the encloſure of a campe to bee appointed out, and rayſed vp with trenches, ſo large and ſpacious, as that an armie of a hundred thouſand men, was able to lodge there, with all furnitures and prouiſions, as ſafely as within a towne, together with all eaſances as well of the Riuer as of the country. As hee thus prouyded for the aduancement of theſe fortifications, ſo ſpared he his purſe no more then his ſpirit, to the entertainement of ſpies, ſent out into all partes. So as hauing vnderſtoode the very force and ordinarie vſage of the twelue hundred horſe which lay in garriſon at Chauny, ſtill ouerrunning without ceaſe, and with great aduantages thoſe about Coucy &amp; Soiſſons, he gaue the rendeuous to Bourdillon, the Prince of Conde, and Counte de la Barbize who conducted the Reiſtres, to ambuſh themſelues within Chauny woods whileſt that hee woulde ſende Ienlis to beginne a skirmiſh to the helpe whereof ſuch as came out of the towne, being no ſooner drawne thither then kept backe, the light horſe gayned both the towne and them: ſo as the Captayne of the Albanois, and his whole troupe was cut in peeces. But the Spaniſhe Captayne getting into a houſe, which hee perced through, held good vntill that the French harquebuſiers had wrapped him in on euery ſide. The which made him in a deſperatneſſe ſteppe forth, his courtelaxe in one hande and buckler in the other, to die honourablie with the reſt of his fellowes, but as hee was giuing his faith to the Captayne Launay, hee killed him, harde by the Prince of Conde who had done as much to the French man, if the ſwearing vnto him, howe that this Captayne had killed the moſt valiant of his ſouldiers, and had euer made fowle warre vpon the French, eſpecially at the defeate of Saint Laurence, hee had not beſought him to pardon this his iuſt chollar, which had ſo farre caried him for the amitie of his countrimen.
            The Baron of Poleuille, paſſing in this time ouer the mountaines of Vaulges, and the Countie of Ferrette, and coaſting Le Baſſigni entred within the French Countie, betweene the Countie of Mont-Belliarde, and Langres: where thoſe of the Countie vnder colour that they were conſtrayned thereunto, contrary to their promiſes, and pactions of neutralitie, gaue him paſſage, victualles, and all other prouiſions for his campe. Afterwardes hee came downe into La Breſſe, hoping within very fewe dayes to make himſelfe maiſter thereof, through certayne intelligences which hee had with ſome gentlemen of that Prouince, and other of their neighbours which were euill affected to Kinge Henrye. So farre, as at his firſt abord hee planted his ſiege before Bourge, which is the principall towne, thinkinge to haue founde it vnprouided of all thinges for defence. But La Guiche which was gouernour thereof, and the Baron of Digoyne his Lieuetenant being aduertiſed of his comming, had already cauſed La Guiches company to enter in, and ſome other troupes of footmen.
            On the other ſide you might perceiue aboue, how D'Eſchenets with his company followed him continually neer hand, as alſo did De Iours with his 8. enſignes of the legion of Champagne, who kept him continually ſo neer a neighbourhood, as they were as ſoone at Bourg as himſelfe, into which they entred, doing therin a great peace of dutie

and ſeruice to the King, and ſo was he founde fruſtrated of his firſt opinion. Vpon the deſſeine, and purſuite of this Siege, the Kings Armie which returned out of Italie, ariued at the iumpe, ſo as the two thouſande harquebuſiers, which were ledde by the Vidaſme of Chartres, entred within the Towne. And from elſewhere they cauſed foure thouſande openly to approache thither, &amp; three thouſande Lanſquenettes, the whole Company which ariued and dayly came beeing ſtayed and lodged about, as well in Breſſe, as Lionnois, and Maſcanois, being all reſolued with full intention to charge when the firſt occaſion ſhoulde be but offred. In the ende after that he had three ſeuerall times remoued his Campe before the place, the ſixetenth day of October, D'eſcheuets about the entring in of the night ſente fiftie harquebuſiers out of the Towne, to viewe his Campe, together with the countenaunce &amp; aſſuredneſſe of his men, who hauing at their firſt ariuall killed the Sentinelles, thruſt in, and broke vpon their Corps de guardes, whome they maſſacred in parte, and cauſed the reſt to flye, putting the reſt of the Armie into ſuch a fryght, as from that houre it diſlodged: And it made ſo great ſpeede to retyre, as before that the French coulde haue certaine newes thereof, and be ready to follow, they were foure leagues off. Where leauing many ſicke perſons, victuals, and moueables, hauing taken agayne the waye to the French Countie, from which they were come, ſhortly after the Troupes brake of themſelues, and abandoned the Baron their Chiefe, for that he perfourmed no iotte of what he had promiſed vnto them.
            Nowe albeit that the deſſeins of this Baron were thus turned into ſmoake,The meanes which the K. vſed to leuie an Armie againſt the Spanyard. and the great fire of the Almaine, Engliſhe, and Spaniſhe Armies, ſeemed to ſmother and decreaſe by little and little, ſo many Nations notwithſtanding being banded againſt Fraunce, coulde not chuſe but greatly diminiſhe the Forces thereof, and prepare a moſt certayne ruyne to the whole Realme, had the Frenchmen wanted heart to defend themſelues, or good will to make ſupplie to ſuch neceſſarie meanes, as mought beſt ſtoppe the courſe of the Spaniſhe fortune. For King Henrye being no leſſe curious, in ſuch occurrences to rayſe vp and encreaſe his honour, then to preſerue his people from the euill which was threatned, foreſeeing the number of Forces, which woulde be neceſſarie for this purpoſe, and howe his Finances beeing drawne drye, there woulde reſt no meanes of furniſhing a paye, excepte he were ſuccoured from elſewhere, was counſelled to renewe the practiſe of his aunceſtours, to witte, to ſeeke ayde and fauour of his people, to whome hee coulde not more commodiouſly declare his necesſitie, and perſwade them to furniſhe out his charge, then by calling together the generall Eſtates of his Realme.The generall Eſtates of France aſſembled by the K. to declare vnto them, his neceſſities and ſeeke ſuccour againſt Spayne at their handes. The which he cauſed to be done at Paris the ſixte of Ianuarie, where all the Deputies being aſſembled in one of the Halles of the Pallace called Saint Lewis hall, the Prelates and Eccleſiaſticall Miniſters arrayed with their rochettes, and ſurplices, were placed vpon ſuch ſeates, as on the right and lefte hande were prepared for them: and on a ſtage vpon the right hande high rayſed vp, were the Baylifes, Seneſchals, and other for the Nobilitie. Vpon a benche belowe, couered with floure de lices, were the Preſidents of the Parlamentes. At the ende whereof, vpon an other leſſer forme on the ſame ſide, ſate the Kinges learned Counſell, of the Parlament of Paris, the two aduocates, and proctours of the King. In the middle of the rome, there ſtoode a little ſquare table, couered with a carpette of cloth of Siluer, at which there ſatte three Secretaries of the commaundementes, and two other a little further vpon a lowe forme. At the foote of the Kinges chayre of Eſtate, ſatte the generall Treaſourers of the Finances, aboue whome and in the fulleſt place of viewe of the whole Hall, were ſette two Chayres, the higher

being couered with purple Veluet pouldred with Flower de Luces Golde, being the Kings ſeate, and a pace and a halfe off, almoſt on the ſame ranke there was another ſomewhat lower couered with cloth of Golde, for Monſieur le D' Auphin his Sonne. And on the top hung vp a cloth of eſtate ſutable to the K. Chaire. The Prouoſt of the Marchants of Paris, the Sherifes, the Deputies of Rouen, of Lyons, of Tolouſe, and conſequently of the reſt of the Townes, were ranged on the Biſhops ſide where there was greateſt roome. Anon after ariued the Knights, hauing their great order about their necke. To wit the D. of Neuers, the Prince de la Roche Sur
                     •
                  yon, the Comte de Sancerre, Durf, and de Bordillon, who mounted vp on the right hand aboue all the Nobilitie, hard by the D. of Lorraine, and the reſt of the young Princes. By and by came the K. and Monſieur le D'Auphin his Sonne, accompanied with the Cardinals of Lorraine, of Bourban, of Guiſe, of Caſtillon, and of Sens. The Kinge being ſet, Monſieur le D'Auphin, and the reſt of the Cardinalles ſat downe on the ſame ſide.
            
               The K. declaration to the eſtates of his Realme.Vpon this the King began to deliuer how ſince his comming to the Crowne he had had continuall war with the Engliſhmen &amp; Bourguignons auncient enemies of Fraunce. Into which warre hee was conſtrained to enter, for the recouerie of ſuch Frontire places, as his enemies had vſurped, as Boulonnois and the reſt, and howe that to furniſh the defraying of the ſame, hee had beene conſtrayned to ſell his owne Domaine, and afterwardes impoſe manie Subſidies vppon his people, wherewith to his great greefe they ſtoode ſore oppreſſed: That for the regarde and conſideration of them, hee had offered to obtaine place, albeit it was at verie preiudiciall conditions for himſelfe, but onely hee was mooued thereunto for the ſingular deſire which hee had to keepe his people in a peaceable eſtate, whome hee had alwaies founde moſt faithfull and enclineable to his obedience and ſeruice. And for ſo much as hee ſtoode aduertiſed that his ſaid enemies, were in a farre greater deliberation then euer, to enterpriſe and aſſaile the Realme of Fraunce, hee repoſed all his whole truſt after God, in the fidelitie and ſuccours of his ſaide Subiectes, and therefore hee purpoſed to make a ſtrong, great and extreame warre, thereby to recouer a good peace, as of meere neceſsitie being compelled thereunto. But for ſo much as money is the principall ſinew of warre, he earneſtly beſought euerie one of the ſtates, that they would now ſuccour him to reſiſt the enemie, and that afterwards hee would employ all his endeuour, to attaine, and preſerue his Subiectes in tranquillitie: Promiſing in the fayth of a good Kinge and Prince, that hee woulde from thence forwarde ſo graciouſly vſe them and ſettle all thinges in ſuch an order, as euerie man ſhoulde haue occaſion to contente himſelfe, and that for pledge of his good will and affection, hee chooſe to make this promiſe in publicque, and in his Sonnes preſence, to the ende that both of them might thereby bee comprehended, and bound to the performance of the ſame.
            The Kinge hauing finiſhed his ſpeech, the Cardinall of Lorraine, holding the firſt place, and ſpeaking for the eſtate of the Church, beganne a moſt learned ſpeeche and Oration, and grauelye pronounced, which laſted the ſpade of an hower, as well in the prayſe of the Kinge, as yeelding vnto him thankes for his good will and promiſe: Concluding that they woulde all ſubmit theyr bodies and goodes to his will and good pleaſure. The Duke of Neuers ſpeaking for the Nobilitie in fewe wordes ſayde, that they were ſo affectionated, to his ſeruice and the Realmes defence, as that they preſented vnto the Kinge not onely theyr bodies and goodes, but alſo their liues. Afterwardes Sainte Andre firſt

Preſident of Paris, anſwering vpon his knees, in the behalfe of the law, and all the preſidents of the reſt of the Parliaments of Fraunce, firſt thanked the King for the good and honour which it had pleaſed his Maieſtie to do them, in erecting a fourth eſtate of the Lawe: and alſo to manifeſt vnto his Subiectes; his good will and affection, with ſundrie other ſpeeches and thankes giuings, tending to the prayſe of his greatneſſe, and of his promiſe, in that hee woulde ſo couragiouſly maintaine warre, by repelling of the enemie, to attayne a long and perpetuall peace for his Subiectes, and afterwardes to redreſſe all thinges into theyr order, to the repoſe and contentment of euerye one offering on the behalfe of that eſtate, not onelye the goodes but the verie bodyes of the officers of Courtes: for the laſt eſtate of the commons, and Deputies of Townes, Du Mortier ſtepped vpp, and hauing made three great reuerences, hee moſt humbly thanked the Kinge for the good will which hee beare vnto his Subiectes, in ſeeking to preſerue them in peace, after reſiſtaunce of the enemie, eſpeciallye hee approoued and greatlie prayſed, the good deſire which hee had to ſettle Fraunce agayne in good order, which had ſuffered manie diſorders thorough the neceſsitie of warres, which notwithſtanding albeit that the poore people were alreadye weakened and waxen feeble in theyr power, yet woulde it rather let it ſelfe bloude, that after hauing expoſed vnto him their bodies and goodes, they might likewiſe ſacrifice theyr liues for the defence of the Realme.
            After that all the Deputies had finiſhed their propoſitions, before that the Kinge roſe, the Cardinall of Sens, keeper of the greate Seale, kneeled downe before the Kinge bowing downe his head verie lowe. Afterwardes ryſing vp hee returned towardes the aſsiſtantes, and ſaide, that the Kinge had commaunded him to vſe this ſpeeche vnto all the people. That to beginne to reſtore all thinges into a good diſpoſition for the comforte and repoſe of Fraunce, euerie one of the Deputies of the Townes ſhoulde ſet downe in writing all theyr griefes, and put thoſe pointes into Articles which had moſt neede of reformation, and then deliuer them into the ſaide Du Mortier his handes. Vppon which the Kinge with the Lordes of his Councell, would particularly order euerie one, as hee ſhoulde ſee needefull, and in ſuch time, as they ſhoulde bee made priuie vnto. And that the Deputies ſhoulde not departe out of the Towne, vntill they had more amplie vnderſtoode the Kinges pleaſure. This being ſaide, the Kinge aroſe, and after himſelfe being retyred, euerie man tooke the waie of his retreate. Certaine daies after the Deputies of the Townes, were ſent for to the Cardinall of Sens his lodging, where they found the Cardinall of Lorraine, with other of the priuie Councell. There the Cardinall of Lorraine, deliuered vnto the Deputies of the Townes, the ende and ſcope of his aſſemblie, to witte that the Kinge woulde borrow three Millions of Golde, and that hee woulde haue found out three thouſand perſons within his Realme, which might lend him euerie man a thouſand Crownes, declaring how that the Cleargie had alreadie offred a thouſand men, which ſhould lend euerie man a thouſand. That the Townes of Fraunce ſhould find two thouſand men, and that the K. would diminiſh his taxes, for the eaſe of his common people which was greatly oppreſſed therewith. And that there ſhould bee no more cuſtome put vpon marchandiſe for the entertayning of traficque, charging the ſaide Deputies to doe one of the two thinges, euerie man to giue a parte by him ſelfe the Roles of ſuch as were able to furniſhe money,

and the other to giue in writing to Du Mortier, all ſuch Articles as ſeemed good vnto them for the reformation of cauſes. At their departure the deputies conſulted together, and concluded it touching the charge which was giuen vnto them; they were not able to giue anie roles of names, for that it was vnpoſsible for them to bee able to know the eſtate of the perticular perſons: for ſuch a one is oftentimes reputed to haue money which hath leaſt. And for to diſcharge themſelues from giuing anie ſuch Roles, they went the ſame daie to the Cardinall of Lorraine, to whome they declared that it was vnpoſſible to giue vp any ſuch Roles with any certaintie, by reaſon that they were not poſsibly able to knowe and vnderſtande the abilitie and meanes of the inhabitants: for as much as ſome man hath ſtore of goods in apparance which hath no money at all. And for the regard of Marchants which worke vppon their credit, many a one maketh great ſhow, and traficques outwardly, which is neere enough at hand to be come bankroute. Afterwards they of the priuie Counſell deliberated of the matter.
            Whereuppon conſidering how that the Deputies of Townes, were not able to make vp anie true Rowles, thorough the vncertaintie of perſons habilities, they concluded that they would charge and taske in euerie Towne ſo many men as ſhoulde lend money: and if they were not able to lend a thouſand Crownes, then to lende fiue hundred, augmenting the number of perſons. The fourth eſtate afterwardes gaue vp Articles for the reformation of cauſes, according as the preſent time required. Briefely in the ende the Eccleſiaſticall eſtate garunted vnto the King in a pure guift, a Million of Golde beſides the tenthes. And the fouth eſtate two Millions of Golde, declaring further vnto him, that if that woulde not ſuffice to maintaine the warre, and compell the enemie to harken to ſome good peace, they would expoſe al that remayned of their goods and perſons at his ſeruice.
            Hereupon the King perceiuing all his forces to be ioyned together in one, ouer which, and his whole Realme throughout, hee had already declared the Duke of Guiſe his Lieutenant generall, determined that the conqueſt of Calais, &amp; the countie there abouts ſhould be the firſt exploite thereof; and ſo the aduiſe of thoſe which councelled him to aſſaie to recouer ſuch places as were loſt, was differred vntill a better ſeaſon: conſidering that they were wel enough prouided to hold out a long time, that winter approached on; his troupes being come from ſo farre off, eſpecially his men at armes, being altogether wearie with their great paines taking the Sommer before. And the whole Countrie cleane waſted, and eſpecially vnprouided of all victuall, and fourage, thorough the continuance of the warres paſſed. Now as the gentle harte awakeneth, and groweth affected according to the good or euill example of an other, and chiefely in ſeeking to doe beſt, when any hatred or iealouſie is intermingled, ſo this Generall, being curious to make it appeare, that to blot out the Conſtables diſgrace, he had no ſmaller meanes vnder the winges of his Prince, then the D. of Sauoie ſupported by the K. of Spaine, endeuored by his long ſecrete and continuall diligence, to take his aduantages, as happily as the Prince of Piemont had done in his former exploits of Picardie. Therefore vndertaking vpon his honour, the conduct and finall execution of Senarpont Gouernour of Boulonnois his olde and ſo often differred ſecret enterpriſes (to the purſuite wherof the Conſtable marched, had not the deſaſtre of S. Quintins croſſed the courſe of his good happe,) and perceauing how all thinges had of a long time beene made ready, aduiſed, that the better to take away anye ſuſpition from the Spanniardes of his intente and meaning,

the Duke of Neuers ſhould carrie halfe the armie into Campagne, giuing out that he went to batter Luxembourge, Arlon, and other places which Frontered vpon his gouerment, and that the other part ſhould remaine with the D. of Guiſe only to hinder any entire victualling which ſhould bee brought to ſuch places as had beene newly conquered. But the Duke of Neuers ſeeing that nothing preſented it ſelfe of ſuddaine taking, that the Spaniard had diſperſed his armie, in fortefying the places about Luxembourg, which were euill enough prouided, ſent backe his troupes with all diligence to the Duke of Guiſe; who in the meane ſpace bending towards Amiens, as it were to victuall D'ourlen, and after to ſtrengthen Ardres, &amp; Bolongne, found meanes to vnderſtand and learne the paſſages, forces, eſtate and deſſeins of them of Calais. Wher vnderſtanding how that al things remained in the ſame ſtate, as they left them, with a great promptnes he preſented the choyſeſt of his men before the fort of Nieullay on the firſt day of Ianuarie. Where finding at their ariuall a little fort paliſſaded &amp; rayſed vp with earth: which the Engliſh men had builded at S. Agathe, a ſmal village neere hand, and at the beginning of the cawſie which leadeth to Pont de Nieullay,
               The port of Nieullay taken from the Engliſhmen and how. he cauſed it to be aſſaulted by two thouſand Harquebuſiers choſen men, ſeconded with thirtie horſe, with ſo great a furie, as hauing put backe an Enſigne of thoſe which kept it, comming out to the skirmiſh, by fauour of the Cannon, and of the Mariſh which was couered ouer with a three-ſcore horſe, hee cauſed them all in the end to abandon it, and retire themſelues to the great forte of Nieullay.
            The which at the firſt bound greatly aſtonied the Engliſh men, for they expected nothing leſſe then ſuch an encounter, and no waies the French forts to bee either ſo great or ſo neere at hand. And contrariwiſe this victorie at the firſt augmented the others courage, and put them in a great hope of attaining their principall end, when as they perceiued their enemies at the firſt entrie not to be able to withſtand them. At the ſame inſtant albeit it grew alreadie verie late, the generall and de Termes went to view the port of Nieuillay, and preſently were the approches and trenches begon, into which as ſoone as the Artillerie was brought, it was planted with all poſsible diligence, to begin the batterie as ſoone as day would appeare. And for that all the fruite which they hoped of this effect, did require a great promptneſſe, to the ende the beſieged might grow aſtoniſhed without any leaſure to looke into themſelues, and to put them cleane out of hope of looking for any ſuccour, at the ſame time, this Prince cauſed a parte of his armie and Artillerie to march on the left hand all along the Downes to occupie them and gaine an other forte which lyeth at the pointe of the Downes called Ricebanke, the which commaunded and helde all the hauen ſubiecte, ſo as no veſſell of the enemie coulde enter in. Likewiſe it was verie neceſſarie for the obtaining of the Towne of Calais after, to ſeaſe at one blow vpon the fortes which kept the two paſſages, whereof that Nieullay, kept and defended all the cauſies and paſſages by land, part of them being Mareſhie, to the end the Flemings might be cut off from ſuccoring them. And the other which is called Ricebank being taken, woulde keepe anie ſuccours from landing which might be ſent out of England, this hauen of Calais, which Caſar called Iccius Portus, being diſtant from the firſt hauen of England which is called Douer, but fiue leagues off the Seas, able to bee paſſed ouer with a leading gale in two howers. Therefore the Duke of Guiſe hauing all the night, together with the D. D'aumalle his brother, the Marſhall Stroſsy, De Termes, D'Eſtre, great maſter of the Artillerie, De Sanſac, De Tauannes, De Dandelot, and De Senarpont reuiſited, and well viewed the Downes, approched yet neerer to

the forte of Ricebanke; and all at one inſtant, the Sea being verie low ebbed, hee cauſed the young Alegre, and an other Gentleman, to bee conducted by Rendan vnto a certaine place of the porte, where hee knew there was a paſſage, for to ſound it. As it was done and ſpeedily diſpatched, it was reſolued among all the Captaines, to batter and aſſaile theſe two forts together at one time. In which Deſtree trauailed ſo diligently, and cauſed the Vaſtadours and Cannoniers to take ſo extreame paines, as on the next morrow, being the fourth of the month, his Artillerie was readie planted three howers before day againſt theſe two places, and as ſoone as day peeped: beganne to turne againſt the Engliſhmen. The which amaſed in ſuch ſorte thoſe which were beſieged within the fort of Nieullay, as at the ſecond vollie they quitted the place, and in all haſt retired themſelues within the Towne. The Duke of Guiſe, hauing in this ſorte, made the firſt paſſage open, cauſed the French incontinentlie to enter, and be lodged within, where he found a great deale of Artillerie, poulder and munition. Afterwards to ſtop all other ſuccour, which might by land be brought vnto the towne, he cauſed twentie Enſignes of the French Fanterie, &amp; the Almanes of the Reingraue, with eight hundred Reiſters, and two hundred men at armes, vnder the conduct of the Prince de la Roche-sur-yon to bee lodged betweene the Towne and the Mariſh behinde the cauſees. Leauing beſides De Termes, with other companies of Cauallerie, Gendarmerie, and Zuizers, vpon the paſſage from Guines to the Downes, whether this Prince with the reſt of the armie went to encampe. An hower after the taking of the fort of Nieullay, they which were within the forte of Ricebanke, yeelded themſelues vnto the diſcretion of the Generall, of whome they were verie courteouſlie entreated.The forte of Ricebank rendred vp to the Duke of Guiſe. And thus this Prince remained ſeaſed, and poſſeſſed in one day, of two principall places, which were of ſo great importance vnto him, and moſt neceſſarie for to enioy his ful victorie with all. Wherfore purſuing at hand, the occaſion, which ſo fauourably with open armes preſented it ſelfe vnto him, the fourth of that moneth he cauſed ſix Cannons and three long Culuerines to bee mounted before the water Gate, and to breake the flankers and defences, he cauſed the earth to bee remooued and filled vp baskets, and Gabiannades therewith, as if hee had intended to addreſſe his principall batterie in that place, hauing with ſundrie volleyes of the Cannon diſarmed that port, broken, and rent a ſunder certaine towers which might hinder him from going to the breach, which he determined to goe in hand withall Holding thus them which were beſieged in doubt, which part they were beſt to defend, &amp; to prouide for, without doubting any whit at all of the Caſtle, which was ſteepe, drie, and without any Rampires; where all at a blow, he planted fifteene Cannons in batterie, charging and diſcharging all the day long a tempeſt of Artillerie, with ſo great a furie, as towards the night the breach grew verie large, and apparant. So as at the ſame inſtant before it grew night, the D. of Guiſe cauſed D' Andelot Colonel of the Fanterie, to paſſe, (with two hundred Harquebuſiers and Corcelets, followed with a number of Gentlemen,) and goe ioyne and fortefie himſelfe all along the Kaye, and breadth of the porte, which was betweene the Downes and the Towne, whether for to come he muſt neceſſarily paſſe ouer a little water: ordaining further that as ſoone as euer he ſhould become maſter therof, euery man ſhould be made worke, to digge vp a trench and trauerſe,The port o
                     •
                   Calais occupied by D' Andelot and his French companies. with ſuch inſtruments as he had cauſed to be giuen to all the Souldiers, the which might trauerſe and anſwere to the Doue, &amp; wall of the Dich, in that place, which they ment afterwards to breake vp, wherby all the waters of the diches might ſue into the porte, and they likewiſe might goe in couert, from the port vnto the diches.

Beſides the courage, which greatly conducted the worke of the French, the commoditie to haue euerie thing readie, and at hand helped them verie much: for they had ſo long before artificiouſly prouided all matters neceſſarie for this ſiege, as eſpecially to cauſe the men and other munitions to paſſe ouer the Ice, and mareſhes, they cauſed a great quantitie of Hurdels with Peaſe ſtrawe to bee brought by Sea, to the end that the water might not eate, perce, nor corrupt thē. And the better to couer the Harquebuſiers by reaſon that the ſand, and grauel was alreadie diſcouered and in view, they had cauſed a great number of ſtakes: and Pale-bordes of drie woode to be brought, of the ſtrongeſt and lighteſt they could chooſe, of a mans hight, and halfe a foote in thicknes, couered all without, three or fower fingers in thicknes, with writhed paper one ouer an other, ſo as the Harquebuſe coulde not eaſily enter, hauing a reſt beneath, at the foote whereof was an yron Pike, of a foote and an halfe long to faſten it into the ground how hard ſoeuer it were; behinde theſe blinders the Harquebuſiers might ſhoot eaſily thorough a litle hole which was in the middeſt therof. The D. of Guiſe ſeeing how greatly the breach opened, and that three volleyes of Cannon might make it reaſonable, determined as ſoone as he could to giue the aſſaulte. In the meane time to holde his enemies continually in alarums,Inſtruments by art inuented fo
                     •
                   the ſiege of Calais. and to ſtoppe them from Rampiring any waies, he cauſed Gramont at eight of the clocke at night vpon the ebbe of the Sea, to paſſe with three hundred the beſt Harquebuſiers of his troupes, to goe to view the countenance of the beſieged, and with a peale of Harquebuſe ſhot, to diſlodge thoſe which ſhould preſent themſelues vnto them. And at the ſame inſtant the Marſhall Stroſsy, with other three hundred Harquebuſiers, conducted by the Captaine Sarlabos and a hundred Pioners, went to gaine the other end of the port to lodge himſelfe in the little houſes, which were there: and ſo fortefiyng himſelfe with a good trench to remaine there, and commaunde all the porte. Notwithſtanding the bullets flew ſo hot about their eares, as after fiue or ſix ſouldiers and Pioners were ſlaine, they were faine to retire, and come backe to the Generall, who was not farre off, hauing already aduaunced neer vnto the port with D' Aumale, and the Marquiſſe D' Elbuf his brethren, De Montmorency, and De Bouillon, followed with many Gentlemen. In the meane time this Prince hauing cauſed the breach to be thrice viewed, as well by Bracaſſe as by others, and being aduertiſed that it was time, and that it was readie for the aſſaulte without any longer delay, gaue the token, and cauſed Gramont to aduance among the firſt, with his Harquebuſiers, aſsiſted with as many Corcelets, conducted by the Marſhall Stroſſy, followed beſides with two hundred other ſouldiers: and himſelfe on the other ſide hauing waded as deepe as his girdle, went foremoſt before the reſt of the troupes as farre as the foote of the breach. At which the French gaue an aſſaulte, with ſuch an hardineſſe and Impetuoſitie, as after hauing cut a peeces ſuch as they encountred at the firſt, they conſtrained the ouerplus in a ſhort time to quite the Caſtle, which they cleane abandoned to retire themſelues into the Towne. Thus being aduantaged of this paſſage and firſt entrie within Calais, the D. of Guiſe commaunded them to fortefie themſelues, and looke that they might not bee thruſt out, leauing D' Aumale, and the Marquiſſe D' Elbaeuf, his brethren, their Captaines for the reſt of the night, and himſelfe, for that it began to flow, paſſed ouer to the armie on the other ſide, to the end he might ſend them ſuccours by day breake, and to be meete with any diſorder which might chaunce to happen. When the Engliſh men come againe to themſelues, and had gotten their wits together, they greatly repenting the fault which they had cōmitted, in hauing ſo ſodenly abandoned the Caſtle, whereby they ſaw a ful ouerture made for the French into their towne, they returned with a

farre greater hardineſſe than before to recouer the peace againe, iudging that thoſe which were within could not long abide it, and that they could not be ſuccoured, by reaſon that it was floud, and the ſea of a great depth. Thereupon they came violently vpon the French, which attended them with the lyke courage, but with more aduantage. In ſumme, they found ſo great a reſiſtance made, as they were beaten back with a farre greater loſſe than before. But remaining full of opinion that they might regain theyr caſtle, they brought three peeces of artillerie vpon the other end of the bridge towardes the towne, to blowe vp the gate and ſcoure thoſe which ſhould defend it, and from a platforme which was vpon one of the corners of the great place, they ſhot in an infinite number of Cannon ſhot, ſo as it would haue bene thought that no man in the world durſt haue ſhewed himſelfe there, and afterwardes they redoubled another aſſault, more furious than the firſt. Now if it were well aſſaulted, it was better defended, for hauing liuely put them backe, and more than three hundred of their braueſt men lying on the ground dead or hurt, the French in the end ſhut the gates, and ſodainly rampired them behinde, vpon which all courage and hope afterwardes fayled thoſe which were beſieged, So as from thence forwardes they thought it good rather to parlie, and treate of ſome fauourable compoſition, than to make anie longer reſiſtance. Wherefore on the morrowe morning Wentworth, who was gouernor therof, ſent two of the principalleſt men of the towne to the Duke of Guiſe, who demanded verie great conditions for their aduantage. In the end they ſtooped &amp; were content with theſe Articles.
            
               
                  That they ſhould haue their liues ſaued without anie force, or diſpleaſure offered to man, wife, maide, or child. All the inhabitants of the towne ſhould retire themſelues whether they woulde, either into England or into Flanders, with ſuch paſports and ſafe conducts as ſhould be thought neceſſarie for their ſuretie and paſſage, my Lord Wentworth remaining with fiftie ſuch other priſoners of warre as the Duke of Guiſe woulde chooſe out. And for the reſt of the men of warre, they ſhould be bound to paſſe ouer into England. They ſhould leaue behinde them the artillerie, pouder, bullets, armour, enſigne, and generally all kinde of munitions, as well of warre as victualles, within the towne, without breaking, burning, hiding, or endemnifying anie thing at all. As for golde, ſiluer, monie, or not monie, goods, moueables, marchandiſe, and horſe, all ſhould remaine in the diſcretion of the Duke of Guiſe to diſpoſe of, as it ſhoulde ſeeme beſt vnto himſelfe.
               
            
            All which things beeing accorded on the eight of Ianuarie, this Prince began to put out a great parte of the people out of the towne, and the reſt followed according as it was promiſed, without hauing anie wrong or diſturbance done them, without anie one Engliſhmans remayning there. But well an incredible quantity of pouder, artillerie, munition, wolles, and of all ſortes of victuals, which were ſtaide, and the ſurpluſſage giuen in praie to the ſoldiers. After this manner, and in leſſe than ſeuen daies ſpace, was Calais &amp; her fortreſſes cōquered, which as thē was eſteemed impregnable, before which (as the Chronicles of France doo witneſſe, during the raigne of Phillip the ſixt, named De Valois, and in England, of Edward the third) the Engliſh armie layd ſiege during the ſpace of one whole yeere. In the end they which were beſieged with in the towne, were driuen to ſo great a neceſsitie and famine, as they were faine to eate rats and hides of leather, Iohn de Vienne commaunding there, it was yeelded the third daie of Auguſt 1347. wherby the Engliſh inioyed it two hundred &amp; ten yeres, during which ſpace they bragged how they carryed the keyes of France at their girdle, beeing able by this meanes to enter and depart the realme at theyr pleaſure. But as one Phillip king of France loſt it, ſo dyd the French againe conquere it from another Phillip king of England. It was onely incloſed with ſtone walls, full of round towers,

ioyning neere one another, firſt builded for ſpeare and ſhielde, arrowes, or anie other inſtruments of warre without fire, after the old faſhion, and without anie rampires,Deſcription of the Towne of Calais. or other deuiſes or ſubtilties, ſuch as are now a dayes inuented agaynſt the force of our artillerie. At this houre it is iudged to bee one of the fayreſt and ſtrongeſt townes of warre in all Europe. For as much as beſides the naturall ſituation therof, in a place vnacceſſable, for that it is inuironed three partes with riuers, brookes, and mariſhes, and the fourth ſide defended with the ſea, with a great and ſpacious porte, not beeing ſubiect or to bee commanded by anie thing. The arte and inuention of man hath giuen vnto it a forme more ſquare than otherwiſe, new clothed without wyth great, large, &amp; maſsiue rampires, hauing at the three corners towards the mariſh three gret bulwarks, in point triangle-wiſe, wel flanked and armed to couer and defend the curtines. And on the other ſquare towards the downes ſtandeth the caſtle, by which, for that it was not knowen, or the imperfection not remedied, grew this laſt taking of the towne. Beſides, this towne is wholy inuironed with large ditches, and maruellous deepe, with ſprings at the verie bottome, alwayes full of water, by reaſon of a little riuer which commeth from Hames, which paſsing thorough the towne, watereth them, &amp; filleth them full, as well as all the reſt of the little brookes which breake out of the mariſhes, fall downe, and few thether for the moſt part. But which is more praiſe-worthie in a towne of war, there is one of the faireſt ſquare publike places as is poſsible to behold, in which at the leaſt may bee put in battell betweene foure or fiue thouſand men, and the reuenue and profite of the port muſt needes be better, for that it is one of the principalleſt &amp; moſt renowmed townes of the Ocean ſea, whether there is brought from all partes of the world an infinite and ineſtimable riches, and of all ſortes of marchandiſes, and from thence lykewiſe they are diſtributed into ſundrie other Countries. Now whileſt that they battred the towne, the thunder and bruite of the artillerie being heard within England, the Queene to remedy the ſame, cauſed a number of ſhips to bee prepared, which ſhe furniſhed with ſouldiers, and all kind of munitions fit for anie ſuccour to bee ſent thether. But when they approached, and alreadie perceiued the colours and white croſſes to waue vpon the tower of Ricebanke and wals of the towne, without comming anie neerer, they returned backe to carrie report thereof home into their countrie.
            The towne of Calais beeing ſurpriſed in ſo ſhort a time,Guines &amp; Gr. line as it were two ſouldier ſupport Cala
                     •
                  . there grew afterwardes ſome diſputation to which of the two they ſhould addreſſe themſelues, either Graueline or Guines, for ſo much as theſe two fortreſſes ſeemed to bee lyke two ſhoulders to ſupport the towne, and as two ſtrong bulwarkes to cloſe vp the two principall paſſages thereto, to wit, Graueline for Flanders, and the lowe Countries, and Guines for France.
            Notwithſtanding theſe propoſitions being amplie debated of and diſcuſſed, the more ſound opinion reſolued, that Guines imported much more for the conſeruation of Calais than Graueline, although it were far ſtronger and of more difficile acceſſe. According to which aduice, the Generall of Guiſe, without giuing anie great leaſure to the enemie to bethinke himſelfe of anie remedie, purſuing neere his victorie, the thirteenth of this moneth beſieged Guines, where Grey commaunded, wyth a good number of men of warre, and all other kinds of munitions requiſite. At theyr arriuall the French finding the towne abandoned, lodged there for their better help, towards the battering and aſſault of the fortreſſe which was ioyning thereunto. But the Engliſhmen ſurpriſing them as they were growen into a great diſorder about theyr lodging, ſallyed out at a poſterne gate of the caſtle, and thruſt them out vpon the firſt fury,

ſetting in ſpight of them the better part of the houſes on fire, and afterwards retired: but the D. of Guiſe cauſed them to begin the breaches, albeit the Artillerie gaue impediment enough thereunto. So as with an obſtinate aſſurance, and without intermiſsion he cauſed the worke to bee purſued. Where hee himſelfe, to augment theyr courage and to ſerue for an example to euerie one, was ready with the firſt, and had his Mattocke as ſoone ready in his hand to make way for the Cannon as the meaneſt Pioner in the troupe. And in ſuch ſort continued in preparing the ground and dreſſing vp of Gabionades, as within three daies after, hee approched and put the mouth of his Artillerie to the number of thirtie fiue peeces of batterie, iuſt vpon the border and counterſcarpe of the diches, to batter as well pointe blanke, as trauerſing in three places principally, one of the greateſt and principalleſt bulwarks, which flancked on the one ſide the Courtine of the Gate, and on the other their great bulwarke which they called, the keape, vndertaking at the firſt one of the ſtrongeſt of the bulwarkes, in hope after to obtaine better cheape ſome of the leſſe and ſmaller ſorte. Thus verie ſudainely began the batterie. The which endured without ceaſe two daies &amp; a halfe, in ſuch a furie, as within ſo ſhort a ſpace there was diſcharged betweene eight and nine thouſand ſhot of Cannon. In ſuch ſort, as this great bulwarke being opened and diſarmed, the breach by the 20. of this Moneth appeared reaſonable for the aſſaulte. But the D. of Guiſe for all that, knowing by how many waies and deuiſes a breache might be repared, and the meanes and ſubtilties which the enemie might inuent, to entrappe them which ſhould make the aſſaulte, and to fortefie himſelfe within, before that he would hazard his Souldiers, thought it good to make the breach more then once to be veiwed,Guines beſieged the 13. of Ianuarie. and what kind of acceſſe was made, for to goe vp at. And therfore at the firſt blow he ſent fower of his moſt diſpoſte Souldiers which hee could chuſe out, followed with twentie other reſolute men, who were incontinently retired by his owne commandement. The next morrowe he ſent againe fiue Souldiers no leſſe aduenterous then the firſt. The which gaue verie good hope for the comming to the breach: yet not truſting to al theſe reports, for that he would not vpon too light a credite, make a ſuddaine frycaſsie, of ſo many valiant mens liues, as lightly are the foremoſt in ſuch an exploite, he ſent againe ſixe ſcore French ſouldiers, to gaine and preoccupy with the firſt the top and higheſt part of the Parapet, which was on the aſſaylants ſide, that thereby they might couer, and helpe vp a certaine number of Pioners, which he cauſed to mount vp with the ſame tracke, for to plane, and make the mounting vp to the breach more eaſie, which was as yet verie high and rough, commaunding all theſe aduenterers notwithſtanding, that they ſhoulde not vndertake further then they had charge, which they obeyed, gayning with a great number of blowes, and hazard of their life, the toppe of the breach. In the end ſtanding aſſured, that the way was prepared, hee commanded D'Andelot generall of all the French Fanterie to be ready with his ſouldiers, that as ſoone as the token ſhould be giuen, he might readely preſent himſelfe to the aſſaulte. And he for to view with his eye the beginning, and ſuch iſſue as ſhould enſue, and if it were poſsible to diſcerne within the breach, &amp; behold the faſhion of the men within, mounted vp a little Hillocke high enough to diſcouer, that for to ſuſtaine and defend that breach, there needed not ſo many men as the firſt thought for. Wherefore all at the inſtant hee cauſed a regiment of choſen Almanes to marche ſtraight to the breach, to open the firſt paſſage thereof, who with great aſſurance, and without any feare of harme were there ouerthrowne. By the like meanes he made ſigne to D'Andelot that he ſhold follow him with his troupes which he did, for altogether made a maruelous ſtirre to enter; the moſt part of the Souldiers

plonging and entring within the water, and diches of ſeuentie foote in depthe, with ſuch an heate and deſperate hardines, that they forgotte all danger, albeit that the Duke of Guiſe had cauſed bridges to be builded ouerthwarte the diches, with pipes, and caske linked one to an other, vppon which they had caſt plankes and iuyce, and bound them faſt together. All this notwithſtandinge ſuch a vehemente furye puſhed them forwarde, as they had no regarde neyther to bridge nor paſſages, through the verie deſire which they had to enter. And yeat their impetuoſitie was not ſo greate &amp; furious, but that at the firſt bounde they were repulſed, the enemies greately helping themſelues through their artificial fires, &amp; fighting for their life with a ſtrange &amp; incredible obſtinacie. The which the Duke of Guiſe perceauing, came downe the litle hyll, and thruſting hymſelfe into the middeſt of them, reprehended ſome, ſollicited other, and preuailed ſo farre with the reſt, as he reſtored in ſuch a ſorte their heart into theyr bellye, that turning their face, and beginning a freſhe, they redubled with ſuch a corage, and fell to it with ſo greate a force, as the beſeaged fainted vnder the burthen, being no longer able to ſuſtaine this laſt charge: ſo as being ouerthrowne, they abandoned the entrie and lefte the breache to the Frenche and Almanes, with the loſſe of more then three or fowre hundered men, amonge whome there were founde neare hand fowre ſcore Spaniardes of the braueſt men, and of beſt reputation: As the reſt turned their backes, and were either ſlaine in the furie or taken priſoners, the ſame daye the Almanes of Colonell Reicord conducted by his neuew, did on the other ſide force two litle bulwarkes, which had likewiſe beene battered, where the breach was made, &amp; ſo was the baſe courte of the caſtle wholie gained vpon the ſame day. The gouernour Grey, before this loſſe, foreſeeing the danger which was likely to ariue, had retyred himſelf with a ſonne of his into the olde Caſtle, &amp; their principall forte, which they called the Bulwarke or keepe, as were in like ſorte the principall Captaines, and beſt ſoldiars. And had tranſported in with themſelues all their richeſt moueables. All they hauing a while bethought themſelues of their worke, and finding themſelues vnable to reſiſt againſt the fury of the French, determined to parley. And the gouernor Grey ſent the ſame daye two gentlemen to the Duke of Guiſe, to declare vnto him that in defending of that place, being of ſo great marke &amp; importance, the keeping whereof had bene committed to him, he ought not to finde it ſtrange nor in euil part, if as an honeſt man and according to his dutie, he had well defended it, ſo far as to haue endured the aſſault: If he ſhould haue don otherwiſe it had bene againſt his honor and faith, requiring him in the ende to deliuer vnto him, an honeſt compoſition. This Prince hauing vnderſtoode his propoſitions, differred anſwere vntill the next morrowe, albeit that ſome counſelled him to take him at his worde, conſidering that he ſtood as yet vppon his feete and almoſte as ſtrong, as at the firſt, hauing beſides this olde Caſtle whole and entire of a moſt ſtrong and auncient matter, enuironed with moſt deepe dyches, and full of water where they muſt needes make a newe batterye, and where it was posſible to retrenche it, the place beyng ſpacious enoughe: Beſides that there reſted the greate and large Bulwarke of the keepe, which cōmaunded al the reſt, the whole being garniſhed with artillery &amp; mūitions and defended by the beſt aduiſed, and valianteſt men that were. Then on the morrowe being the one &amp; twenteth of this moneth, the Duke of Guiſe accorded this compoſition. That the Soldiors ſhould departe with their armes, but that their enſeignes ſhould remaine in the place, with all artillerye, powder, bulletts, and all other kinde of munition, as well of warre as victuals. As for my Lord Grey, and all the Captanes of qualitie which he had with him, they ſhould remaine priſoners of warre, in the power of the King and of the

Duke of Guiſe. This capitulation being receiued &amp; approued by the beſieged, the day following there departed thence betweene 900. and 1000. men of warre, part Engliſhmen, part Borguignons, and a number of Spaniards, beſides the common ſort, which tooke euery man ſuch courſe as himſelfe liſted, franke and free without any harme or diſpleaſure done vnto them, three or fower hundred dead and hurt remaining behinde.Mondragon a Spanniarde. 
               Grey was retayned priſoner, ſo was Mondragon a Spaniſh Captaine, who hauing beene before priſoner in the Baſtile of Paris, ſaued himſelfe, and was againe committed to ward thither. That done the Duke of Guiſe, for that this place ſeemed verie dangerous if it ſhould bee taken againe, and greatly noyſome to the high waye from Calais into France, eſpecially in being ſo neere vnto Ardres, and that it woulde be a double expence to keepe it, hauing cauſed all the Artillerie munition and victuals to be taken out, cauſed it to be ruined and razed: in the yeare 1351. The towne and Caſtle of Guines, were taken by the Engliſhmen, notwithſtanding the truce which then was, by the conſpiracie &amp; treaſon of one named Gilliaume de Beau Couroy, Lieutennant to the Captaine of that place, who for this cauſe, was beheaded, and afterwards hanged. Now there reſted no more of the whole countie of Doye, but a little Caſtle called Hames, which was not reſtored into the Kings obedience. And for that this Caſtle, albeit that it was little, and not rampired nor fortefied by any art, was notwithſtanding naturally ſeated in ſo ſtrong, &amp; as it were vnacceſsible a ſituation, as being enuironed with Fleetes, Motes, and Mareſches, hauing but a verie narrow cawſie to paſſe ouer into it, and that in manie places croſſed with wooden Bridges broken and taken awaie, it was almoſt impregnable to bee gotten from men well furniſhed and reſolute, they were in a great doubt after what manner they might beſiege it. In the meane time Sipierre, to whome the keeping of this cawſie was committed, hauing the Duke of Lorranes companie whereof hee was Lieutennant, and ſome other,Hamas Caſtle abandoned. aduertiſed the D. of Guiſe, that they which were within Hames, being frighted, and diſmaied at the taking of Guines, had abandoned it, and were fled away by night, thorough certaine by-pathes which they onely were acquainted with all in the Mareſches. And ſo it fel out verie eaſie to be ſeaſed, where they found much Artillerie and prouiſions. Afterwards the French remained in all, and thorough all maſters, and there was neither forte nor Caſtle, which was not yeelded vnto them, or abandoned: ſo that beſides the Countrie which the Duke of Guiſe conquered ouer the Engliſhmen, and the rich booties which were found therin and taken, there were gained neere hand three hundred peeces of Braſſe artillerie, all mounted vpon cariages, and as many of yron.
            
               The K. in his parliament at Paris.After this the King hauing kept his bed of iuſtice, with the Dauphin and the reſt at the Parliament of Paris, and cauſed a number of Ordonances concerning his owne eſtate to bee proclaimed, viſited Calais with the King Dauphin, leauing there De Termes as gouernour, with charge to perfite the fortifications ſuch as you ſee them at this daye.The K. armie diſmiſſed. Afterwardes the rygor of the winter enforced him then to diſmiſſe his armie for to refreſhe themſelues all ſauing ſuch troupes as hee diſtributed into Garriſons, where hee thought moſt neede, reſoluing to redreſſe a newe armie at the ſpring. There was the charge of the light horſe beſtowed vppon the Duke de Nemours, at the inſtance of the Duke of Guiſe, whome he cauſed to bee preferred, before the Prince of Conde, who at the ſame time and before had demaunded this charge, whereupon he grew verie malcontente: then the King went to Fontaine Bleau, whether Anthonie de Bourbon, Duke of Vendomis, and as then King of Nauarre, thorough the deceaſe of the King his late Father in lawe,

came vnto him,Madamoiſelle de Rohan. ſhewing himſelfe beſides much offended with the D. of Nemours by reaſon of the Damoiſelle de Rohan, couſin Germaine to the Q. of Nauarre, who maintained that he had promiſed to marrie her, and vppon that ſued him in the Arches.D. of Neuers. The D. of Neuers being tickled with the good hap which accompanied the Duke of Guiſe, gaue the Rende-uous at Yuoy to all ſuch troupes as hee was able to aſſemble together within his gouernment: wher hauing let them all to vnderſtand, how that there was no place more enemie, nor of greater importance thē the Caſtle of Herbemont, in being the principal place, wher all the enemies bandes aſſembled together, and retired from their enterpriſes, hee reſolued to carrie it away. Therefore hauing cauſed it, that night to be encloſed round with the light horſe, the next morning the armie lay encamped, ready to batter the place, after they had well viewed it thorough hot skirmiſhes, vnder the fauour wherof, they had gained as farre as the Courte, and quickely after was mounted and planted a part of the artillerie to batter downe with Cannon, out of the flankers of the Caſtle. But when they perceiued how little they preuailed thereby, by reaſon of the hard and bad ſituation thereof, they planted the Cannon, right in front and at the head, to batter a bulwarke, which couered and defended the onely paſſage and entrance vnto it, which they ſhot off ſo furiouſly, and beſtirred themſelues ſo well in ſo ſhort a ſpace, albeit that the breach was not ſufficient to giue the aſſaulte to, as the deſired parlie, vpon ſome conditions. But being deceiued in his demaunds, and a ſhort anſwere being made him by this Prince, how that he ſhould ſpeake of no other cōpoſition, then yeeld to his mercy,The Caſtle of Hebermont yeelded. otherwiſe that if he made not good haſt, he ſhould inſtantly bee cut in peeces, with all his, albeit that hee was nothing ſo neere daunger, as the faintneſſe of his heart imagined, truſting in the bountie of this Prince, he notwithſtanding yeeld himſelfe vnto his mercy: of which at the entreatie of Iametz he found experience, the D. of Neuers vſing ſuch ſweetnes, as to ſend him away with his wife, and family, and generally all the reſt of the ſouldiers which were within, their liues &amp; goods ſaued, without being any waies pilled or ranſomed. This done, the Prince ſent a number of light horſe, and Harquebuſiers on horſe backe, to view the ports of Iamoigne, Chigny, Roſsignol and Villemont, part whereof they found already abandoned, and the reſt yeelded at the firſt ſummons. They were determined to haue gone yet further forwards, and to haue giuen as far as Neufchaſtel in Ardaines. But the raynes, ſnowes, and great froſtes broke off their deſſeins. Now the only taking of this Caſtle of Hebermont, ought not to be placed among the leaſt, for beſides that it is naturally ſtrong and eaſie to bee made inexpugnable, as being ſituate vpon a high and hard rocke, on all parts vnacceſsible, ſauing by this paſſage, by which it was battered, yet is it moſt proper &amp; conuenient for the aſſuring of the whole paſſages of the Ardenes, all the Champion ouer, and ſeconding the ſtrong Caſtle of Bouillon, to hold in awe all the fortes, of the long forreſts of Ardenes: it appertaineth to the comte Biliſten, and the Rochefort, to the keeping whereof: was appointed the Captaine de la Croix, Lieutenant to Haute-Courte.
