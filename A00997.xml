            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               MY LORD,
            
            
               THE Histories of
Lucius Florus,
cōprehending in
foure short Books
the one hundred, fortie and
two of that principall Historian
of the Romans, Titus
Liuius of Padua, and of manie

other, written, hard to
say, whether more conceitfully
or completely, are here
translated out of their Latin
into English. A labour greater
farre (as all our learned
know) then for the slender
bulke of the volume. His
Maiesties great example,
and your Lordships feruent
imitation, to increase in the
ful sail of fortune, the balasse
of worthy readings, is here
in part well fitted. For your
Honour cannot possibly find
in so little a room so much, so
well together, of this weightie
argument. A thing to
your Lordship acceptable,
considering your small leisure,
and to all those other
who haue already profitably

runne through his authors:
himselfe so briefe as it is almost
his fault; so neate, and
pithy, as Liuie fares the
worse for it, so desirous to remember
what himselfe hath
said, and to haue it vnderstood
by others, as he summs
his owne summarie narrations;
and finally, so worthy, as
seeing the glorie of a great
Historian forestall'd by Liuie,
and others, hee held it
more honorable to be (as hee
is) the first among briefe
writers, then one among few
in the large ones. Epitome's
notwithstanding are no
other in truth but Anatomies,
and all spacious minds,
waited vpon with the felicities
of meanes, and leisure,

will flie them as bane, but this
briefe hath all the requisites
of a perfect body, and apparrell
as rich as any; for professing
Storie, he hath certainly
performed a Panegyrick.
His scope, to kindle the valor
of the old Roman world
in the bosome of the new:
though himselfe, an heathen
man, and liuing vnder Traian
the emperour, saw the
proportion of valour well-maintained:
that being the
most goodly, and most flourishing
estate, which at any
time vnder heathen princes,
that monarchie enioyed.
Those annotations, and collections,
whose lights will
lead your Lordship into the
wise, and heroik secret of the

most potent, graue, and honourable,
masters which euer
mankind had, are fittest for
your more leisure. To your
good Lordship therefore, in
whose person the ancient
splendors of the noble families
of VILLERS, &amp; BEAVMONT
are vnited with aduantage,
doth Luciꝰ Florus
offer himselfe in our vulgar
tongue, and brings with him
the plaine, but withall, the
free, and grounded good-will
of his most louing, and carefull
interpreter, humbly
            
               Your Lordships,
               PHILANACTOPHIL.
            
         
         
            
            
            To the Reader.
            
               FLORVS (saith
IVSTVS LIPSIVS,
who in
Mr. CAMDENS
opinion carryed the Sunne
of antiquity before him)
wrote a briefe, not so much
of Liuie (from whom he often
dissenteth) as of the Roman
affaires, in my poore
conceite, aptly, elegantly,
neatly. There is in him a
sharpnesse of wit, and shortnesse
of speech, oftentimes
admirable; and certaine
gemmes as it were, and

iewels of wise sentences, inserted
by him with good aduisement,
and veritie. Thus
farre that excellent master,
and with him let thy
iudgement goe, if thou
wilt herein doe iustice,
howsoeuer, with Mathematicall
Stadius, FLORVS
is but a tumultuarie author:
for so it pleaseth that learned
Critike to style him,
ouer-loading him with
the comparison of incomparable
Liuie. Bee it free,
with reuerence and modestie,
to note ouer-sights
(as none doe want them)
and for me also, a professour
of sober freedome, to
taxe that as an ouer-sight
in manners, to vse such authors

sowrely, without
whom the Criticks fame
had often-times beene obscure,
or none at all. In
mine Hypercriticks, concerning
our countreys
Historie, I haue dealt freely,
as a man desirous to
stirre vp a Liuie, or a Florus
to our selues. There is
little left testifide touching
him, or rather nothing at
all, but what himselfe remembreth,
which is, that
hee liued in Traians time.
Coniecture propounds vnto
vs, that hee was of the
Seneca's (that also is my
opinion) and so an Annaean
by line (that is, of the Spanish-house,
or family of
the Annaeans) and they

who entitle him to bee of
the Iulij, haue also their
diuinatorie reasons. His
generous, bright, and
flowrie writings (the best
memoriall) are aliue, and
now translated into our
vulgar, with as much proprietie
as one Englishmans
English could attaine vnto
for the present; but euery
where with a religious
ayme to his meaning,
howsoeuer it may bee many
times mist, the diuersity
of Copies, like a change of
the marke, and the peculiar
manner of his stile like
a sudden blast comming
betweene. For this is true,
that there are in FLORVS
sundrie knots, not easie to

vntie, while he, desirous to
speake quick, and close together,
our vnderstanding
in him, wanteth roome as
it were, and that scope
which is, hath somewhat
thicke in it, amounting to
a clowdinesse:
—breuis esse laboro,
obscurus fio—
more perhaps, in this author,
through corruption
of manuscripts, and Prints,
or of our duller-pointed
wits, then through his
fault, whose writings are
altogether as luminous,
as acuminons.
            First, the names of men,
nations, places, offices, and
things, peculiar to the Romans,
need a particular interpreter,

which this pocket-volume
will not handsomely
permit, at least-wise not in
present.
            
                Secondly, the words which
are here and there inserted
in a different letter through
the text of Florus, are for
the most part explanatorie
of the authors meaning, supplying
marginall notes.
            
                Thirdly, one elegancie,
which is almost perpetuall in
him, and answers to the first
similitude, in which hee figures
the whole people of
Rome, in the person of a
MAN (as the frontispice
sheweth) it lost for the greater
part, throughout the
translation, where the singular
number sorts not so well,

but breedes perplexitie, or
obscurenesse.
            Fourthly, The doctrines 
which hee followes both in
Theologie, and moralitie,
and vpon which the fabricke
of his narrations standeth,
are such as thou art to expect
from an heathen, with whom
Polytheism, or pluralitie of
Gods, was an article of faith,
and among whom, selfe-killing,
to auoid disgrace, seemed
an high point of true
magnanimitie, and the like,
which haue small danger in
them now, &amp; their examen
will else-where fall out fitly.
            Fifthly, The numbers in 
the margine, signifie the
yeeres from Rome built,
which these letters, A. V. C.
               
doe denotate, that is, Anno
Vrbis Conditae; in the
yeere of Rome Built, such,
or such. A discouerie not
worthy of any one, but onely
of them, who are nothing
else in a manner, but meere
English. Necessarie is it here
notwithstanding, for explanation
of the author, who (as
the frontispice, which (with
the helpe of the authors preface)
interprets it-selfe,
vnfoldeth) by a most exact,
and studied method of briefnesse,
hath summ'd the whole
time of Rome in grosse, and
distributed it into ages, as
Lactatius Firmianus (vouching
I know not what Seneca
for it) and Ammianus
Marcellinus in his eighteenth

booke, and lornandes
an vsurper, and concealer
of Florus his wit) vnder
the I'mperour Iustinian.
            
            What the translatour
thinkes worthy of thy precious
time, to knew further,
requires a large booke, rather
then an Epistle, and
that also wil be but a briefe
vpon a briefe) of all the
old Roman wisedome ciuill,
and martiall, as here thou
hast of their facts. Enioy
this translation in the mean
time, and let not vnthankfulnes
strangle any intendments
for thy more satisfaction,
nor shew thee ignorant
of such a treasure, as
which, after aboue one
thousand foure hundred

yeers cōtinuance (twice the
time of this storie) growing
stronger in the world
by one language more then
his owne (when the Roman
empire it selfe (the subiect
of the booke) hath long
since in a manner come
to nothing) doth
giue great hope
that it is to be
immortall.
            Farewell.
         
         
            
            
            
            THE
PREFACE
OF LVCIVS
FLORVS.
            
               THE People of
Rome, from
King Romulus
to Caesar
Augustus, for the space of
seuen hundred yeeres, performed
so many noble deeds
both in peace, and warre,
that if a man compare the
magnitude of their empire
with the number of the
yeeres, hee will thinke it

greater, then for the time.
They displayed their warlike
ensignes so farre, and
wide vpon the globe of the
earth, that such as reade
their performances, may
learne in them, not the actions
of one people, but of all
mankind: For they were
tossed with so many labors,
and perils, that to establish
their empire, Vertue and
Fortune seeme to haue contended.
Which thing, though
it be also principally worth
the knowing; neuerthelesse,
for so much as the very
greatnesse it selfe is an impediment
to it selfe, and the
varietie of matter makes
the mind abruptly flit from
one thing to another;Aciem intentionis abrumpit. I will

imitate them who draw the
maps of countreyes, and
comprehend the whole
image of that great Body,
within as it were a narrow
table: And in so doing,
my hopes are, that I shall
offer vp somewhat towards
the admirable honours of
the whole worlds soueraigne
people, when together,
and yet distinctly in
it selfe, I shall aduance into
view their empires vniuersall
greatnesse. Imagining
therefore the whole
people of Rome were but
as one single person; and
then running ouer all their
time, thinke how they began,
and how they grew
strong; then, how they attained

to a certaine flower
as it were of youth, and
how in a sort they afterwards
waxed old, wee shall
therein find foure degrees,
or maine progressions.
            The first reuolution was
vnder kings, for almost two
hundred and fiftie yeeres;
in which space they wrestled
and stroue about their Mother-citie
with their neighbours.
This may be the
time of their infancie. The
following period, from the
Consulship of Brutus, and
Collatinus, to the Consulship
of Appius Claudius,
andMarcus. 
               Quintus Fuluius,
comprehends those two hundreth
and fiftie yeeres, in
which they subdued Italy.
               
This was a time most famous
for manhood, and
deeds of Cheualrie. It may
well be therefore tearmed
their youthfull age. From
hence, to Augustus Caesar,
are those other two hundreth
and fiftie yeeres, in
which he settled peace thorow
all the world. And this
compasse of time is the very
Mans estate, and as it were
the strength and ripenesse of
the Roman Empire. From
Augustus Caesar, to our
dayes, there haue not passed
many fewer then two hundreth
yeeres; in which,
through the vnworthinesse
of Emperours, the force of
the Roman people waxt
old, as it were, and wasted

it selfe: sauing, that vnder
the gouernment of Traian,
their sinewes requicken,
and beyond all expectation,
the old age of the empire,
as if the youth thereof
were restored, growes
greene againe,
and flourisheth.
         
      
      
         
            
            THE
HISTORIE
OF THE ROMANS.
            
               The first Booke.
               
                  CHAP. I.
                  Of ROMVLVS, first King
of Romans.
                  
                     THe first founder
of the citie, and
empire of Rome,
was ROMVLVS,
the sonne of Mars, and

                     Rhea. Syluia.
                     Vestae Sacerdos. This the Vestall
Priestesse, great with
child, confest of her selfe,
nor did fame long doubt
thereof, when Romulus, by
commaundement of Amulius,
throwne into the riuer,
together with his brother
Remus, could not be
drowned. For the Genius
of Tiber both checkt down
his waters, and a sheewolfe
following the crye
of the babes, left her yong
ones, and with her teats
discharged towards them
the office of a mother.
And in this plight, found
vnder a tree, Faustulus,
the kings shepheard conueyed
them to his farmehouse,
and bred them vp.

                     Alba, built by Iulius, was
then the chiefe citie of
Latium, which his father
Aeneas had reared. Amulius
was the foureteenth
king from these, and expelled
his brother Numitor,
of whose daughter
Romulus was borne. Hee
therefore, in the first heats
of his youth, chased his
vncle Amulius out of the
royall seat, and restored
his grandfather; himselfe
delighting in the riuer,
and mountaines, among
which hee had beene educated,
was busied in plotting
the walls of a new
towne. These brothers
were twinnes; and it was
therefore agreed betweene

them, to make the gods
iudges, which of them
should first enter vpon the
gouernement and rule.
Remus tooke his stand vpon
mount Auentine, and
Romulus vpon mount Palatine.
It was the fortune
of Remus to see birds first,
and they were sixe Vultures;
Romulus saw last,
but had twelue. So hauing
the vpper hand in this triall
by bird-flight, he builds
his citie, full of hope, that
it would proue a martiall
one; according as those
birds, accustomed to bloud
and rauine, did portend.
AVallum. trench and rampire
seemed sufficient to defend
the new citie; whose narrownesse

while Remus derided,
and leapt ouer, in reproofe
thereof, hee was
slaine; whether by his brothers
commandement, or
no, is doubtfull. Certaine
it is, that hee was the first
sacrifice, and consecrated
the new cities fortification
with his bloud. There
wanted inhabitants. Neere
hand grew a groue, which
hee makes a place of sanctuarie;
and thither a wondrous
companie of men
did forthwith flocke, some
of them Latins, some shepheards
of Hetruria, and other
of them some of those
beyond-sea Phrygians,
who were vnder Aeneas,
and of those Arcadians,
                     
who hauing Euander for
their Generall, had come
flowing in. Thus of, as it
were diuerse elements he
gathered together one Body,
and himselfe composed
of them the Roman people.
This was a worke of
Time, the increase of inhabitants
was a worke of
Men. Therefore they
sought wiues from among
the neighbours;
whom, when they could
not obtaine by suit, they
tooke by force. For they
pretending to make shews
and games on horsebacke,
the maids assembled from
parts about, to behold
them, were seised as lawfull
pray. This ministred

an occasion of present war.
The Veientes were beaten,
and put to flight. The Caeninensians
had their towne
taken, and rased; and king
Romulus, with his owne
hands, offered vp to Iupiter
Feretrius, the magnificent
spoyles, which he had
gayned from his aduersarie
Acron.King. The gates of
Rome were betraid to the
Sabines by a sillyTarpeia. Virgin,
who had bargayned to
receiue for reward that
which they carryed on
their left hands, doubtfull,
whether shee meant their
shields, or bracelets. They
both to keepe their promise,
and not to suffer her
to escape, ouer-whelmed

her to death with their
shields. The enemies thus
getting to the walls, there
rose a terrible conflict in
the very entrance, so farreforth,
that Romulus was
glad to beseech Ioue, to
flay his people from their
shamefull flying. In this
place there is a temple,
and the statue of IVPITER
the Stayer. At last, they
which had beene rauished,
came running-in tearing
their haire, betweene the
two armies, as they were
furiously encountring. So
was peace made with Tatius,
and a league ratified.
There ensued a matter
wonderfull to bee spoken.
The Sabine enemies leauing

their ancient seate, remoued
with their whole
families into the new citie,
and share their horded
riches among their sonnes
in law for portions. Their
ioynt forces quickly encreasing,
the most wise Romulus
ordayned this forme
of common-weale. That
the young men, deuided
into tribes, should serue
on horse-back, and watch
in armour, to bee readie
for all sudden occasions of
warre: the councell of
estate should belong to
the old, and ancient, who
for their authoritie should
be called Fathers, and for
their antiquitie, Senators,
or Aldermen. These things

thus established,A. V. C. XXXVIII. he was taken
out of sight in a moment,
as hee made an oration
before the citie, at the
poole of Capra. Some
thinke he was torne in pieces
by the Senate, for his
harsh, and rough disposition:
but a tempest rising
with an eclipse of the Sun,
made it seeme like the consecration
of a God-head.
Which opinion, Iulius Proculus,
caused to go presently
currant, by affirming,
that Romulus had appeared
to him in a more maiesticall
shape, then euer hee
was seene before: that hee
commanded, they should
adore him as a power diuine:
That the Gods had

decreed, his name in heauen
should bee Quirinus:
and that Rome should so
obtayne the empire of the
world.

                     TO Romulus succeeded
Numa Pompilius,
whom liuing
at the Sabines Cures, the
Romans, of their owne accord,
intreated to bee their
king, for the fame of his
religion. He taught them
sacred rites, and ceremonies,
and all the worship of
the immortall gods. Hee
instituted their Colleges of

priests of all sorts, Pontifices,
Augures, Salians, and
the rest: distinguisht the
yeere into twelue months,
&amp; markt out which dayes
were luckie, and which
were dismall, in them. He
gaue them their Ancilia
shields, and Palladium, as
certayne secret pledges of
empire. Hee gaue them
their temple of Ianus, to
be the sure signe of peace,
or warre: most specially
the harth of Vesta, for virgins
to adore, that in imitation
of the starres of heauen,
the flame preserued
there aliue, might euer
keepe awake for safegard
of the state. All these things
he ordayned, by, as it were,

the oracle of the goddesse
Egeria, that the barbarous
might so accept them the
rather. To conclude, hee
brought the fierce people
to that passe, that the kingdome
which they had atchieued
by violence, and
wrong, they gouerned by
religion and iustice.

                     NEXT after Numa,
reignes Tullus Hostilius,
to whome
the kingdome was freely
giuen in honor of his vertue.
This prince founded

all their martiall discipline,
and arte of warre. Their
young-men thereby, wonderously
practised in feates
of Armes, they durst prouoke
the Albanes, an honourable
people, &amp; which
had long time borne chiefe
sway. But their forces being
equall, and their conflicts
many, when both
sides were diminished, the
warre was drawne, by consent,
to a short worke, and
the fortunes of both the
nations were entrusted to
a combat, betweene the
Horatij and Curatij, being
three to three of a side, and
brethren. The fight was
braue and doubtfull, and
admirable in the euent. For

three of the one side being
wounded, and two of the
other slaine, that Horatius,
who remayned aliue, helping
out his valour with
his wit, faynes himselfe to
flie, so to single forth the
enemie, and then turning
vpon each as they were
able to follow, ouer-came
them all. So (which was otherwise
a rare glorie) the
victorie was gotten with
one mans hand, which hee
forth with stained by parricide.
Hee saw his sister
weepe at the sight of the
conquered spoiles he wore,
being her betrothed husband's,
though an enemies.
Which vnseasonable tender-heartednesse
he reuenged

with sheathing his
sword in her. For this haynous
fact, hee was arraigned.
But the merit of his
man-hood preserued the
offendor from danger, and
the crime was hidden with
in his valours glorie. Nor
did the Albanes long keepe
their faith. For, being sent
as aydes, and fellowes in
armes against the Fidenates,
according to the articles
of their league, they
turned neutrall in battell
for their owne aduantage.
But the politike king, Hostilius,
so soone as hee saw
his associates incline to the
enemies partie, he gathers
fresh spirit, as if hee had
willed them so to doe;

which did put hope into
our men, and strooke feare
into the foes. So the treason
came to nothing. The
battell therefore being
wonne, he causeth Metius
Fufetius, the breaker of
the league, to be tyed betweene
two chariots, and
pluckt in pieces with swift
horses: and though Alba
was the mother of Rome,
yet withall, because it was
a riuall, he threw it to the
ground, after hee had first
transported the whole riches,
and all the people
thereof to Rome: that a citie,
a kinne by the whole
bloud, might not altogether
seeme to haue perished,
but to haue, as it were,

turned againe into her proper
Body.

                     Nepos.Grand-Childe of
Pompilius by his daughter,
and of such a wit. Hee
therfore girt the citie with
a wall, and ioyned both
the sides thereof together
with a bridge ouer Tibris,
which ran betweene; and
planted a Colonie at Ostia,
where that riuer falls into
the sea. His minde giuing
him euen then, that the
wealth of the whole world

and passengers to and fro,
out of all parts, should be
receiued there, as in the
hauen towne and maritim
Inne of Rome.

                        TArquinius, afterward
called Priscus,
though descended
from forainers beyond
sea; yet of his owne
free courage demaunding
the kingdome, had it as
freely graunted, for his industrie,
and noble carriage.
For sprung out of Corinth,
hee had mingled

                     Greeke wit with Italian
fashions. This prince inlarged
the maiestie of the
Senate, and augmented the
Tribes with new Centuries:
notwithstanding, that
Attius Naeuius, excellently
seene in Augurie, had forbidden
the number to be
encreased: of whom, the
king, to trie his skill, demaunded,
Whether that
might be done which hee
at that instant had in his
minde? Naeuius hauing
first put in practice the
rules of his bird-flying mysterie,
answered, That it
might. Then it was my
thought (quoth he) whether
I could cut that whetstone
with a rasour. And

thou mayest (said the Augur)
and he did it. Hence
the Augur-ship became sacred
among the Romans.
Nor was Tarquinius better
at peace, then at warre.
For hee conquered the
twelue Tuscan nations,
with often fighting: and
from thence came our Maces,
our Trabeae, our Chairs
of State, our Rings, Trappers,
Robes, purple-guarded
Coats, Chariots of Triumph
guilt ouer, drawne
with foure horses, embroydered
Gownes, Cassocks
chambleted with figures of
palmes: and briefely, all
the ornaments &amp; ensignes,
by which soueraigne Maiestie
is made eminent.

                     THen Seruius Tullius
vsurpeth the royall
power: nor was his
basenesse any barre vnto
him therein, though his
mother was a bond-woman.
For Tanaquil, the
wife of Tarquinius, had
bred him vp in honourable
fashion for his excellent dispositions
sake: and a flame
being seene to blaze about
his head, did assure hee
should prooue famous.
Therefore, in the Interregnum,
after Tarquinius
his death, hee being set vp

by the Queene dowagers
meanes, to supply the
Kings place, as it were but
for a time, so managed that
authority by his wit, which
he had atchieued by practice,
that hee seemed to
haue good right vnto it. By
him the people of Rome
had their estates valued,Relatus in censum.
and bookes of value, and
musters made, themselues
marshalled into formes, or
classes, and distributed into
courts and companies. And
by this kings incomparable
diligence, the Commonweale
was so ordered, that
note was taken of all their
lands, goods, honours, ages,
arts, and offices, and put into
publike register; as if the

state of a most mightie citie
were to be kept vp and
held together with the
same diligence that a pettie
familie.
               
               
                  CHAP. VII.
                  Of TARQVINIVS
SVPERBVS.
                  
                     THe last of all the
kings, was Tarquinius,
surnamed the
Proud, of his conditions.
He rather made choise to
inuade, then to expect
his grandfathers realme,
which was with-holden by
Seruius: whose murther
hauing procured, hee gouerned
the Commonweale

as badly, as he had obtained
it wickedly. Nor was
his wife Tullia of any better
nature then himselfe.
For hurrying to salute her
husband King, shee ranne
her amazed Coach-horse
ouer the bloudie bodie of
her father. But Tarquinius
raging with slaughter against
the Senate, and against
all men with proud
behauiour (which worthie
men brooke worse
then crueltie) after hee
had tired himselfe at home
with shedding bloud, hee
marcheth at length against
the enemie. So Ardea,
Ocriculum, Gabij, Suessa
Pometia, towns of strength
in Latin land, were taken.

Then turned hee cruell
towards his owne. For
hee stucke not to scourge
his sonne, to the intent,
that thereupon counterfeiting
himselfe a fugitiue, he
might gayne credit with
the enemie: and Gabij,
according to this plot, being
surprized, when the
sonne sent messengers to
his father to vnderstand
his farther royall pleasure,
he only strucke off the tops
of those poppie-heads,
with his wand, which ouer-topt
their fellowes;
meaning thereby, that he
would haue the chiefe men
put to death. And this
was all the answere which
his pride vouchsafed. Neuerthelesse,

he built a temple
out of the spoyles of
conquered cities. Which
when it came to be dedicated,
according to the
rites, all other the Gods
(a wonder to be spoken)
leauing the place, Iuuentas
and Terminus only remained.
This contumacie of
the powers diuine pleased
the soothsayers well: for
it promised, that the Roman
affaires should be flourishing,
and eternall. But
this was maruelous, that in
digging to build, there appeared
the head of a man
for a foundation: which
all men did confidently interprete,
as a most faire and
happie signe, prognosticating,

that there should bee
the head seat of the whole
worlds empire. The people
of Rome suffered the
pride of their king, while
their women were forborne:
but that insolent
abuse they could not endure
in his sonnes: Of
whom, when one of them
had rauished that most
beautious Lady Lucretia,
and shee clearing her selfe
from the infamie, by killing
her selfe, then they
vtterly abrogated their
name, and all the authoritie
of Kings.

                  The summe of the whole
premisses.
                  
                     THis is the first age of
the people, of Rome,
and as it were their
infancie, vnder seuen kings:
men, by as it were a speciall
prouision of the fates,
as differing in disposition,
as the reason and profit
of the Commonweale required.
For who could
bee more hote, or fierie,
then Romulus? But there
was need of hauing such
an one, to set vp the kingdome
perforce. Who was
more religious then Numa?
But their assayres

could not want such a
person, that the fierce
people might bee made
temperate, through the
feare of the Gods. How
necessarie was that Master
of their martiall discipline,
Tullus, to a warlike
Nation? for whetting,
and perfecting their courages
with reason. How
needfull was Ancus, the
builder? that the citie
might spread it selfe, by
sending out a Colonie;
that the parts thereof
might bee vnited by a
bridge, and it selfe bee
defended with a Wall.
Againe, how great dignitie,
and grace, did the
ornaments, and ensignes,

which Tarquinius Priscus
brought in, giue to the
worlds chiefe people, by
their very fashion? What
other effect had the musters,
and suruey which
Seruius tooke, then that
the commonweale might
know, and vnderstand it
selfe? Lastly, the intolerable
lordlinesse of Superbus
did some good, nay, a very
great deale of good. For
thereby it came to passe,
that the people stung with
abuses, were inflamed with
the desire of freedome.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. III.
                  Of the change in State,
from Kings, to a Commonweale.
                  
                     THe people therefore
of Rome hauing
Brutus,
                     A. V. C. CCXLIV. and
Collatinus (to whom the
noble matron recommended
at her death, her iniuries
reuenge) for captaines,
&amp; authors, &amp; by as it were
a diuine instinct, being
throughly all of them resolued
to restore themselues
to libertie, and secure
the honor of their
women, sodeinly fell away
from the king, spoile his

goods, consecrate his
ground to Mars, and transferre
the soueraigne power
to the same men, who had
beene founders of their
freedome, but yet changeing
both the iudge, &amp; title.
For it was agreed, that
whereas the authoritie had
before beene single, and
perpetuall; it should bee
now but from yeere to
yeere, and bipartite, lest
either by singularitie, or
continuance it should bee
corrupted: and for kings
they styled them Consuls,
that they might remember
the dutie of their place
was to consult, and prouide
for their Countrey.
Such ioy was conceiued

for this new freedome, that
they could hardly beleeue
the change, and one of the
Consuls, because he was of
kingly name, and race, they
depriued him of his office,
and banished him the
citie. Into whose roome
Valerius Poplicola being
substituted, hee bent his
whole studies to augment
the free maiessie of the
people. For hee bowed
downe to them the Fasces
in their assemblie, and
made it lawfull to appeale
from the Consuls to the
people. And that the shew
of a seeming castle might
not offend, he pluckt down
his house which stood
high, &amp; built it on a flat, or

leuel. But Brutus to come
with all his sailes into popularitie,
did both cast
his house to the ground,
and slue his sonnes. For
hauing discouer'd, that
they practised to bring in
kings againe, he drew them
forth into the Forum, and
in the mid'st of the assemblie,
scourged them first
with rods, and then cut off
their heads with the axe:
so that he plainly seemed,
as a common father, to
haue adopted the people
of Rome into the place of
his children. From henceforth
free, the first armes
which the people tooke,
were against aliens for
maintenance of their libertie;

secundly for their
bounds; thirdly for their
associates, as also, for
glorie, and dominion;
their neighbours by all
meanes daily vexing them.
For whereas they had in
the beginning no land of
their owne lying to their
citie, they forthwith enlarged
their territories
with that which they
wonne from the enemie,
and being situated in the
midst, betweene Latium,
and Tuscanie, as it were in
a two-way-leet, they neuer
gaue ouer to issue out
of their gates against the
aduersarie, till running like
a kinde of plague through
euery nation, and alwayes

laying hold of such as were
next, they brought all Italie
at last to be vnder their
subiection.
               
               
                  CHAP. X.
                  The warre with the Tuscans,
and King PORSENA.
                  
                     KIngs being driuen
out of the city,A. V. C. CCXLVI. the
first armes which
the people tooke were for
supportation of their freedome.
For Porsena, king of
Tuscans, was at hand with
huge forces, and brought
backe the Tarquins, vnder
his protection. Neuerthelesse,
though he prest them,

                     to accept the king againe,
with fighting, and with famine,
and had gotten
mount Ianiculum, which
stood in the very iawes of
the citie, yet they both resisted,
and forced him also
to retire: and finally they
strooke him into so great
admiration, that after hee
was now growne too hard,
he voluntarily entred into
a league of friendship with
that people, which he had
almost ouercome. Then
were seene those braue
Roman aduentures, and
wonders, Horatius, Mutius,
Claelia, who if they were
not in chronicles would at
this day bee taken for fables.
For Horatius Cocles,
                     
after that hee alone could
not keepe off the enemies,
who assaulted him on all
sides, and that the bridge
was broken downe behinde
him, hee crost ouer
Tibris, swimming, and yet
held his weapons fast. Mutius
Scaeuola came by a
stratagem to the king,
and attempted to stabbe
him in his campe; but
when hee saw the stroake
lost, by mistaking another
for him, he thrust his hand
into the prepared fire, and
doubled the kings terrour
by his cunning. For thus
he said: That thou mayst
know from what manner of
man thou hast escaped, three
hundred of vs haue all

sworne the same thing.
Meane while (an horrible
thing to be spoken) Horatius
stood vndaunted, and
the other shook with feare,
as if it had beene the kings
hand which burned. Thus
much for men. But, that
neither of the sexes should
want their praise, behold
the courage of a noble damosel
Claelia, one of the
hostages deliuer'd to the
king, breakes from her keepers,
and swam safe home
on horsbacke through her
natiue countreys riuer.
Porsena terrifide with so
many, and so notable faire
warnings, bade them farewell,
and bee free. The
Tarquins fought so long,

as till Brutus, with his
owne hand, slue Aruns,
the guiltie sonne of king
Tarquinius, and till himselfe
also being wounded
by the same Aruns, fell
downe dead withall vpon
the bodie, as if he plainely
meant to pursue the adulterer
euen to hell.
               
               
                  CHAP. XI.
                  The warre with the
Latins.
                  
                     THe Latins in like
sort vpon emulation,
and enuy, tooke
in hand the quarrell of
Tarquinius, that the people
which were Lords abroad,

might be made vassals
at home. All Latium
therefore, hauing Manilius
of Tusculum for leader,
was vp in armes, vpon pretense
to reuenge the kings
wrong. They encountred
at sake Regillus in
doubtfull fight for a long
time, till the Dictator himselfe,
Posthumius, tost the
standard among the enemies
(a new, and famous
deuice) that it might bee
recouered with running
in; andFlorus hath Cossus, not Aebutius. 
                     Titus Aebutius
Elua, Master of the horsemen,
commanded them to
slippe their bridles ouer
their horse heads (and this
also was a new deuice) that
they might charge the

more desperately. To
conclude, such was the furious
brauerie of the battle,
that the Gods are said
to haue giuen it the looking-on;
and that Castor,
and Pollux, two of them,
did, mounted vpon white
coursers, no mā doubteth.
Therefore the Generall of
the Romans adored, and
vpon condition of victorie,
vow'd them a temple, and
duely performed it, as pay
to his fellow-souldiers.
Thus farre for libertie.
Their next warre with the
Latins was concerning limits,
and bounders, which
brake out presently, and
continued without truce.
Sora (who would beleeue

it?) and Algidum,
petie cities, were then a terrour
to Rome. Satricum, &amp;
Corniculum, townes of no
more fame, were Prouinces.
Ouer Veij, &amp; Bouilli,
a shame to say it, yet wee
triumphed. Tibur which is
now but a suburb, and
Praeneste but our summer-recreation,
were then demanded
of the Gods, as
mighty maters, with
vowes for victory made
solemnly first in the Capitol.
Faesulae were then what
Taphrae were of late; and
the forest of Aricinum the
same, which in these dayes
the huge Hercinian woods;
Fregellae what Gessoriacum;
and Tibrsis what Euphrates.
                     
Nay it was then
held an act of so great glorie
to haue ouercome but
Corioli, that Caius Marcius
(fie vpon it) was thereof
called Coriolanus, as if hee
had cōquer'd Numantia in
Spaine, or the worlds third
portion, Africa. There are
at this day to be seene the
tropheas of the sea-fight
at Antium, which Caius
Maeuius, hauing vanquisht
the enemies nauie, hung
vp in the stage of the Forum;
if that at leastwise
may bee termed a nauie;
for they were but sixe
beak-heads: But in those
young dayes, that number
made a battle at sea. The
Aequi, and Volscians were

neuerthelesse of all the
Latin nations, the most obstinately
bent, and, as I
may cal them, quotidian enemies.
But Lucius Quinctius
chiefly brought them
vnder; that noble Dictator,
who taken from holding
the plough, did by his
excellent vertue deliuer
the Consul, Lucius Minurius
as he was besieged, &amp;
almost distressed in his
campe. It was then about
the mid'st of seed-time,
when the officer of armes
sent from the Senate found
patriciuni virum.the honourable man
at his plough-worke. From
thence setting forward to
the army, hee, to shew hee
had not left off any point

of countrey-fashions, compelled
the conquer'd enemies
to passe reproachfully
vnder the yoke, like
cattle. And so the seruice
ending, he returned home
to his oxen, a triumphall
husbandman. O the
goodnesse of the Gods
how great was the speed!
The warre was all begun,
&amp; ended, within the space
of two and twentie dayes;
that the Dictator might
seeme to haue hastned
home to his rurall taske
left behinde vnfinished.

                  The warre with the Falisci,
and Fidenates.
                  
                     OVr daily, and yeerely
enemies were
the Veientines, people
of Tuscanie, so farre
forth, that the noble house
of the Fabij promised to
the state an extraordinarie
band of voluntaries,
&amp; vndertooke their part of
the warre, vpon their priuate
charge, but with too
too great calamitie to thē
                     selues.
For at the riuer
of Cremera,
                     A. V. C. CCLXXIV. three hundred
and sixe of them, a
little armie of lords, were
slaine; and that gate of

                     Rome through which they
issued to that encounter
was thereupon entituled
Dismall. But that deadly
blow was reuenged
with notable victories, as
their strongest townes
were taken from them by
sundrie Roman Generals,
with differing euents. The
Falisci yeelded themselues
of their owne accord.
They of Fidenae
were burnt with their
owne firebrands. The
citie of the Veientes was
ransackt, and razed for euer.
The Falisci yeelded
vpon admiration of their
aduersaries noblenesse, and
not without cause; for the
Roman Generall sent back

the trecherous Pedant
fast bound, before those
childrē 
                     which he brought,
with a purpose by their surrender
to betray the citie.
For Furius Camillus, a
wise, and religious gentleman,
well vnderstood, that
victorie to bee a true one,
which was atchieued without
wrong to common honestie,
and with honour
saued. The Fidenates, to
scarre vs, came marching
forward, like an host of infernall
furies, with blazing
firebrands in their hands,
&amp; flaring head-tires speckled
like skinnes of serpents:
but that gastly spectacle
was nothing but an omen
of their owne destruction.

How great a State the
Veientines were, those ten
yeeres siege, which they
endured, maketh euident:
this was the first time of
our wintring in tents, of
leuying money vpon the
Commons, to pay a winter-campe:
and the souldiers,
of their owne free
wils, tooke a solemne oath
neuer to rise from before
the citie, till they had taken
it. The spoiles of
king Lartes Tolumnius
were brought to Iupiter
Feretrius. To conclude,
the last act of that cities
tragedie was not performed
by scaling ladders, or
assaults, but by mines, and
stratagems vnder ground.

The hugenesse of the
bootle was such, that the
tithes thereof were sent
ouer-sea to Pythian Apollo,
and the whole people of
Rome were called foorth
to share in the pillage. Such
were the Veientines then.
Now, who is hee that
once remembreth them to
haue had a being? which
are their remaines? or
which the least token of
them? The credit of Histories
is put hard to it, in
making vs beleeue that euer
Veij were.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. XIII.
                  The Gallick warre.
                  
                     AFter this, either by
the enuie of the
Gods, or by destinie,
the most round quick
streame of spredding dominion,
was for a while
kept vnder by the ouerflowings
of the Galli Senones.
Which season, it is
hard to say, whether it were
more dismall to the Roman
people through terrible
calamities, or glorious for
the proofes they gaue of
their manhood. Certaine it
is, that the violence of
their extremes was such, as
I may well think they were

sent from heauen of purpose;
the immortall Gods
desirous to try, whether
the vertue of the Romanes
might deserue the empire
of the world. These Galli
Senones, a nation naturally
fierce, of a wilde behauiour,
their bodies huge
aswell as their warre-like
weapons, were in all respects
so dreadfull, as they
seemed no other then
borne to destroy mankinde
and beate downe cities.
In former ages,
when the Ocean had surrounded
all, they comming
in an huge plumpe
from the vtmost coasts
of the earth, when they
first had wasted what was

in their way, and then seated
themselues betweene
the Alpes, and Po, nor yet
contented there, they wandred
also ouer Italie. They
lay now at siege before
Clusium. The Romans became
intercessours, as for
their fellowes, and confederates.
Ambassadors were
sent, as the manner is: But
what regard hath right, or
wrong, among the barbarous?
They carrie themselues
roughly; and transferre
the quarrell, from
thence. Rising therefore
from before Clusium, and
comming to Rome, the
Consull Fabius giues them
battell with an armie, at
the riuer Alia. The discomfiture

at Cremera was
not more piteous. The
Romans therefore marke
this day among their black
ones. Our forces defeated,
they forthwith approch
the walls of Rome.
There was no garrison.
Then, or else neuer, did the
Roman brauerie of minde
appeare. For, so soone as
might be, such of the Senatours,
as had borne highest
offices, assemble in the
Forum, and vnder the curses
of the chiefe Priest,
banne, and deuoue themselues,
for their Countries
safetie, to the gods infernall:
and, those dire ceremonies
ended, they were
each of them immediately

put backe againe to their
houses, before which, they
seated themselues vpon
their Court-chaires, apparelled
in their robes of
state, and most honourable
habiliments, that when the
enemie came vpon them,
they might die in the maiestie
of their places. The
Priests, and Flamines, did
partly packe vp, in dryfats,
whatsoeuer was most
religiously esteemed of, in
their temples, couering
them vnder ground, and
partly trussed into carts,
transporting it away with
themselues. The Virgins
also of Vesta's colledge did
bare-foot accompany their
flying gods. At which

time, Albinius, one of the
common people, is said to
haue taken his wife &amp; children
out of their waggon,
and placed those virgins
there. So that euen in
those dayes the religion of
the State was more deare
vnto vs, then priuate affection.
Such as were able
to beare armes, whose
number was scarce sixe
thousand, followed Manlius,
for captaine, vp into
the Capitoll, praying high
Ioue, as if he were euen present
then among them,
that as they were flockt
together for defence of his
temple, so he againe would
protest their valour vnder
his title. Meane while the

                     Galls come, at first as men
amazed, finding the gate
wide open, suspitious of
some plot: but when they
found all hush, they enter
disorderly, with no lesse a
cry, then furie. They goe
to the houses, whose dores
stood euery-where open;
and when they beheld the
purple-cloathed Senatours
sitting in their chayres of
state, they worshipt them
at first as gods, or locall
Ghosts: but so soone as
it appeared they were
mortall men, and that otherwise
they disdained to
answer, they straightwayes
did as absurdly sacrifice, as
adore them; burne buildings,
&amp; with fire-brands,

yron tooles, and force of
hands, lay the whole citie
as low as the soile it stood
vpon. Seuen months (who
would beleeue it?) the barbarous
houered about one
hill, hauing not onely by
day, but by night, assayed
all meanes to force it:
whom, when at last they
were mounted vp in the
darke, Manlius wakened
with the creaking of a
goose, threw headlong
backe from the top of the
cragge: and to put the enemie
out of all hope of
staruing them, hurled
loaues of bread from the
castle, to make a show of
confidence, though their
famine was extreme. And

vpon a certaine set day hee
sent forth Fabius, through
the middest of the enemies
guards, to performe a solemne
sacrifice vpon mount
Quirinal: who, by the
meere awe of religion, returned
vntoucht through
the thickest of the leaguers
weapons, and brought assurance
backe, that they had
the gods their friends. At
last, when the barbarous
were tyred now with their
owne siege, contented to
sell their departure at a
thousand pound weight of
gold, and then also putting
in a sword ouer and aboue
their bargaine, into the
false ballances they weighed
by, insolently iustifying it

by this cutting quippe, Woe
to them who are ouercome,
L. Camillus suddenly assayles
them at their backs,
and made such slaughter
among them, that all the
characters of destruction,
which fire had printed in
the citie, were blotted out
with the inundations of
the bloud of the Galls.
We may well giue thanks
to the immortall gods in
the behalfe it selfe of so
great a calamitie. That fire
and flame which destroyed
Rome, buried the pouertie
of Romulus. For what other
thing else did that
burning, but prouide, that
the citie which the Fates
ordained to be the mansion

seat of men, &amp; gods, might
not seeme to haue beene
consumed, or ouer-whelmed,
but hallowed, and
expiated rather? Therefore,
after Rome was thus
defended by Manlius, and
deliuered by Camillus, it
rose vp against bordering
nations more eagerly and
vehemently then before.
And to begin at those very
Galls themselues, shee, not
satisfied with hauing driuen
them out, beyond her
walls, but drawing after
her the ruines of countries,
wider ouer Italy, did so
bunt and pursue them vnder
Camillus, as that at this
day there remains no footstep
of such a people as the

                     Senones, Shee made one
slaughter of them at the riuer
Anien, where Manlius,
in a single combat, tooke
from the aduersarie champion
a Torques, or chayne
of gold. Thence were the
Manlij by-named Torquati.
Another time shee had
the execution of them in
the Pontin fields, where
Marcus Valerius, in a like
duëll, seconded by a sacred
bird, reft his pursuing enemie
of his armes; &amp; of that
bird Coruus, a crow, the Valerij
were entituled Coruini.
Nor as yet giuing ouer, Dolabella,
after some yeeres,
did vtterly extinguish the
remaines of those generations,
at the lake of Vadimon,
                     
in Tuscanie, that none
of them might be aliue, to
glorie, they had burned
Rome.

                        MAnlius Torquatus,
                     A. V. C. CCCCXIII
and Decius Mus,
Consuls, the Romans
turned their weapons
points from the Galls, vpon
the Latins, men alwayes
troublesome, through emulation
of being like in
power, and in bearing office;
but then specially, out
of contempt, because the
citie had beene fired; and
therefore they demaunded

to bee absolutely free of
Rome, and to haue equall
authoritie in state, and
comming to Magistracie,
as the Romans; so that now
they durst doe more then
encounter. At which time
notwithstanding who will
wonder if the Latins gaue
way? When one of the
Consuls put his own sonne
to death, for hauing fought
against the discipline of
warre without leaue,
though hee got the vpper
hand, as thinking Obedience
a more important matter
then victorie: and the
other Consull, as if counselled
thereunto from heauen,
couering his head, deuoued,
and gaue himselfe

to the infernall gods, before
the first rankes of the armie,
and shooting himselfe
forward into the thickest
troupes of the enemies
battell, opened a new path
to victorie, by the track of
his bloud.

of Rome set vpon
the Sabins; who growne
vnmindfull of that old alliance
of theirs vnder Titus
Tatius, had ioyned themselues
to the Latins, as infected
with a kind of martiall

neighbourhood. But
Curius Dentatus, Consull,
they wasted with fire and
sword all the space of
ground, from the riuer Nar,
and the springs of Velinus,
vp as farre as to the Adrian
sea. By which conquest,
there was so much land,
and so much people subdued,
that whether of them
were most, not hee who
had ouercome them, could
imagine.

                  Warre with the Samnits.
                  
                     THen, moued vpon
the petition of the
countrey of Campania,
they inuaded the

                     Samnits, not on behalfe of
themselues, but, which was
more honourable, on behalfe
of their associates.
Both the nations had strucken
a league with the Romans;
                     A. V. C. CDXII.
but they of Campania,
by surrender of their
whole estate, had made it
more sincerely, and before
the other. The Romans
therefore vnder-went the
warre with the Samnits, as
in their proper right. Campania
is the most faire and
goodly countrey, not only
of Italie, but of all the
world. Nothing is more
delicate then the aire: flowers
spring there twice euerie
yeere. No soyle can be
richer; and therefore it is

named the contention, or
wager of Bacchus, and Ceres.
Nothing can be more
harborous, then the sea,
which lyes before it. Here
are those famous hauen-townes,
Caieta, Misenus,
and Baiae, warmed with her
proper fountaines: here are
the lakes, Lucrinus, &amp; Auernus,
bowers of delight, for
the sea to recreate in. Here
the vines apparrell the
mountaines, Gaurus, Falernus,
Massicus, and, the fayrest
of all the rest, Vesuuius,
Aetna's riuall for casting
out flames. Cities vpon
the sea-coast, Fermiae, Cumae,
Puteoli, Naples, Herculaneum,
Pempeij; and Capua,
Queene of Cities,

and once accounted after
Rome, and Carthage, the
third maine Citie of the
world. For this Seat, and
those Regions, the people
of Rome inuaded the Samnits,
a nation, if you respect
wealth, glittering in armor
of gold, and siluer-plate,
and cloathed in diuerse-coloured
garments, who
should be brauest; if deceitfulness
of ambuscadoes,
they are bold for the
most part vpon the aduantage
of wilde woods, and
mountaines, fitted for the
purpose; if madnesse, and
rage, they were bent to the
subuersion of Rome, and
that intention of theirs solemnly
bound vp with cursed

lawes, and humane sacrifices;
if their obstinacie,
after six breaches of league,
and many notable ouerthrowes,
they were still
more stomachous. All
these things notwithstanding,
the Romans, in fiftie
yeeres space, by the conduct
of their Fabij, and Papirij,
the fathers, and the sonnes,
did so subdue, and tame
them, and so razed downe
the very ruines of their
cities, that Samnium is at
this day sought for in vaine
in Samnium; nor doth the
matter of foure and twenty
triumphs easily appeare.
But the most notable and
famous foyle which euer
happened to the Romans
                     
by this nation, was receiued
at the Forkes of Caudium,
Veturius, and Posthumius,
Consuls. For our
army being drawne by stratagem,
and shut vp within
such a fastnesse, as out of
which it could not escape,
Pontius, captaine generall of
the Samnits, amazed at his
owne aduantage, asked
counsell of Herennius, his
father, who as an old souldier,
wisely bade him, either
to let all goe free, or to kill
them all. But hee, following
neither of the courses,
contented himselfe with
only disarming, and passing
them naked vnder forkes,
or gallowses; and so they
neither became friends as

                     in thankefulnesse for a benefit,
and yet after the
foule dis-honour, greater
enemies then euer. The
Consuls therefore, by voluntarie
yeelding themselues
back to the Samnits,
came gloriously off from
the infamie of that league;
and the Roman souldiers
crying for reuenge, to Papirius
their new Generall,
fell to raging (an horrible
thing to be spoken) with
their drawne swords, vpon
the very way it selfe, before
they came to fight;
and in the battell (as the
Samnits themselues gaue
it out) the eyes of the Roman
were on a bright
blaze of fire; and neuer

gaue ouer killing, till they
had payd the enemie, and
their captiue captaine, their
owne forcks home againe.

                  Warre with the Etruscans,
Samnits, and
Galls.
                  
                     HItherto the people
of Rome had to
deale in battell
with one nation after another
apart;A. V. C. CDLIIX. but now in
heapes with many at once,
and yet euen so also were
hard enough for them all.
The Tuscans stirred at that
time, with them the Samnits,
                     
the most ancient people
of Italy, and all the rest,
suddenly concurre to raze
out the Roman name. The
terrour of so many, and so
mightie conspired nations,
was extreme. The ensignes
of foure armies of
their enemies waued in
flanke vpon them, from
Etruria. Meane while, the
Ciminian forrest, which lay
betweene Rome, and that
armie, reputed as impassable
till then, as either the
woods of Caledon, or Hercinia,
was so much misdoubted,
that the Senate
forbad the Consull from
daring to venture vpon so
great a perill. But none of
these things hindered the

Generall from sending his
brother in scowt, to discouer
the pase. Hee, in a
shepheards disguise, executes
his part by night, and
vpon his returne makes full
report. Then Fabius Maximus,
by hazzarding one
man, made an end of a most
hazzardous warre. For falling
in at vnawares vpon
the enemie, straggling loosly,
and making himselfe
master of the highest
grounds, and tops of hills,
thundred from thence, after
his manner, vpon them
vnderneath. For such was
the face of that warre, as
if volleyes of lightning,
and thunder had beene
discharged from the clouds

of heauen vpon the old
earth-borne Gyants. Howbeit,
the victorie was not
vnbloudie.A. V. C. CDLIX. For Decius,
the other of the Consuls,
ouer-set in the bosome of
the valley, tooke vpon his
owne head, by his fathers
example, all the wrath of
the Gods, and made the
vnder-going of generall
curses, for the generall
good, which was now
growne appropriated to
his familie, to be the price,
and rate at which to purchase
victorie.

                  The warre of Tarent, and
with king Pyrrhus.
                  
                     THe warre of Tarent
followes,A. V. C. CDLXXII. single
in name, and title,
but affording many victories.
For this inuolued
as it were in one ruin, the
Campanians, Apulians,
Lucanians, and, the head,
or toppe of the warre, the
Tarentines, all Italy, and together
with these the most
noble prince in Greece, king
Pyrrhus: so that at one,
and the same time, the conquest
of Italy was finisht,
and a luckie signe giuen of
fetching home triumphs

from beyond sea. Tarentus
it selfe, sounded by the
Lacedemonians, was once
the metropolis of Calabria,
and Apulia, and of all
Lucania, aswell renowned
for greatnesse, fortifications,
and a port, as admirable
in its situation: for
placed at the very entrance
into the Adriatick sea, it
fitly sends forth shipping
for our coasts, for Istria, Illyricum,
Epyrus, Achaia,
Africa, &amp; Sicilia. There
lookes vpon the harbor, in
prospect of the sea, the cities
theater, the originall
cause of all her calamities.
They were then at their
solemne sports, when the
fleet of Roman gallies was

from thence espi'd to row
by the shore: and imagining
them to bee enemies,
the Tarentines hurrie out,
and pell mell enter vpon
them, not well knowing either
who, or from what
place they were. Presently
hereupon, ambassadours
from Rome brought a complaint;
but they violate
their persons also, after a
lewd fashion, and filthy to
be spoken. Thus rose the
warre. Dreadfull were the
aduersaries preparations,
when so many nations stirred
at once on behalfe of
the Tarentines; and fiercer
then they all, king Pyrrhus,
who as in defence of that
citie, which by reason of

her Lacedaemonian founders,
was Greekish, came attended
vpon with the
whole strengths of Epyrus,
Thessalie, Macedonia, of elephants
(till that time vnknowne)
of sea, of land,
men, horse, armour, and
the terrour of those wilde
beasts added. The first
battel was at Heraclea, and
Liris, a riuer of Campania,
Laeuinus Consul: which
was so desperately heady,
that Obsidius, captaine
of the Farentan troupe,
chargeing king Pyrrhus
home, disordred, and compelled
him, hauing first
cast away his ensignes, or
notes of a king, to abandon
the fight. There would

haue beene an end, had not
the elephants come forth,
a sight of wonder, &amp; made
their race into the battell,
whose hugenesse, hideous
shape, strange smell, and
braying noise, amazed the
horse, and seeming huger
then they were, through
being vnacquainted-with,
put the armie in rowt, flying
farre, and neere, and
made a monstrous hauock.
The secund battell at Asculum
in Apulia was more
fortunate, Fabricius, and
Aemilius, Consuls. For
by this time the feare conceiued
of the elephants
was worne away, and Caius
Minucius, a speare in
the fourth legion, cutting

one of their trunkes off,
had made it appeare, that
they were mortall. Therefore,
the iauelins were darted
thicke at them also:
and firebrands hurld into
the towres, ouerwhelm'd
all the aduersaries squadrons
with the fall of their
burning workes: nor was
there any other end of the
ouerthrow, but that
which night made by parting;
king Pyrrhus himselfe,
last of them who
fled, being wounded in the
shoulder, was borne away
armed, by his guard.
The last battell was in Lucania,
neere the fields
which they call Aurusin,
vnder the same Generals,

as before. And that euent
which vertue was about
to haue giuen heere,
for an vpshot, or clozing
victorie, fortune gaue.
For the elephants being
brought againe into the
vantgard, one of them a
yong one, being grieuously
wounded in the head with
a weapon,auertit. turn'd taile:
and as in flying, it rusht
thorow, ouer the bodies
of friends, and bemoned
it selfe in braying, the dam
knew it, and as it were to
take reuenge for her foale,
started out of her ranke;
then filled all with feare, &amp;
affright round about, no otherwise
then as if they
had been her aduersaries: so

the same beasts which carried
away the first day
cleere, and made the secund
indifferent, gaue away
the third past controuersie.
But the warre with
king Pyrrhus was not in
the fields abroad with forces
onely, but with wit also,
and at home within the
citie. For the cunning
prince, after hee had obtained
the first victory, hauing
well felt what manner of
men hee had to deale with
in the Romans, despaired
to preuaile by force, &amp; betooke
himselfe to deuices.
For hee burnt the slaine,
vsed his prisoners louingly,
and sent them home free
without ransome. And in

the necke of that, dispatching
ambassadours to Rome,
labour'd by all possible
meanes to be admitted as a
friend. But the Roman vertue
approued it selfe then
for excellent, in warre, and
peace, abroad, &amp; at home,
in all points: neither did euer
any victorie rather
show the valour of the people,
the high wisdome of
the Senate, and the magnanimity▪
slenders, then the
Tarentine. What kind of
men were trampled to
death in the first battell by
the elephants? all their
wounds were forward,
some found dead vpon
their enemies bodies, in euery
mans hand his sword,

threatnings left vpon their
browes, and anger liuing in
death it selfe. Which Pyrrhus
so admired, that hee
said, O how easie were it for
mee, to become lord of the
world, if I were captaine of
the Roman souldiers, or
for the Romans, had they
mee for their king! And
what speed made they
who suruiued the first ouerthrow,
in renforceing
their powers? when Pyrrhus
said; I see as sure as can
bee, that I am borne vnder
the constellation of Hercules,
for that so many
more heads as I haue slain,
spring out of their owne
bloud, as it were out of
Lernas serpent. And what

a Senate was that? when
vpon the oration of Appius
the Blinde, the kings
ambassadours who were
sent backe out of the citie
with their gifts and presents,
confest to Pyrrhus,
vpon his demand of what
they thought concerning
the enemies seat, that the
citie seemed a temple, the
Senate a parliament of
kings. Againe, what manner
of men were the Generals
themselues in camp?
when Curius sent the kings
physician back, who made
offer in secret, for a certain
summe to poyson him,
and Fabricius, hauing the
choise giuen by Pyrrhus,
refused to share a kingdome

with him. Or what
were they in time of peace?
when Curius preferred his
earthen dishes before the
Samnits gold; and Fabricius,
vsing Censorian seueritie,
condemn'd it for riotous
in Rufinus, a Consularie
nobleman, because hee
had siluer plate, in all to a
tenne pound weight. Who
wonders now, if the people
of Rome, with such qualities,
courages, and martiall
discipline, obtained victory;
or that by this one Tarentine
warre they should in
foure yeeres space bring
into subiection (as they
did) the greatest part of all
Italy, most puissant nations,
most rich commonweals,

&amp; most fertill countreys?
Or what doth so
much surpasse beliefe, as
when you compare the
beginnings of the warre
with the conclusion? Pyrrhus,
conquerour in the
first field, harrased trembling
Italy, Campania, Liris,
and Fregellae, came within
ken of Rome, then almost
taken, as he beheld it from
the castell of Praeneste, and
within twentie miles off,
filled the eyes of the quaking
citie with smoak, and
dust. The same prince, enforced
twice after that to
quit his campe, twice
wounded, and beaten ouer
land, and sea, into his
Greece againe; peace, and

quiet, and the spoiles,
which were gotten from
so many the richest nations,
so infinite, as Rome
was not wide enough to
containe her owne victorie.
For there neuer entred
a more glittering, or
more goodly triumph, because
before this time, shee
had beheld nothing but
the cattell of the Volscians,
the heards of the Sabins,
thecarpenta. chariots of the
Galls, the manufactures of
the Samnits armes. But,
had you beene now a spectator,
the captiues were
Molossians, Thessalians,
Macedonians, the Brutian,
Apulian, and Lucaner, the
pompe consisted of gold,

purple, statua's, tables, &amp; the
delicacies of Tarent. But
Rome saw nothing, which
contented her more, then
those beasts with towrs on
their backes, of which shee
had stood in such feare,
and they againe, sensible of
their captiuitie, followed
drouping with down-hanging
neckes after the horse
their Masters.

had set vp the libertie giuen

age of the Roman
people, and as it
were their youth, a time in
which they were most
fresh, and budding out in
certaine fierie shoots, boild
ouer as it were in iollitie of
spirit. On the other side,

that wildenes which they
retained of their shepheardish

foorth some-what still,
which was vntamed in thē.
Thence it came, that the

their Generall, to
death, for refusing to giue
them the shares he promised.
That vnder Appius
Claudius they would not
ouercome the enemie whē
they might.A. V. C. CCXXCI. That vnder

crusht the Consuls fasces.
Thence it was, that they
punisht the most honourable
commanders they had,
with banishment, for resisting

their pleasure, as Coriolanus,
whome they
condemnd to the plough.
Which iniurie he would as
harshly haue chastised with
his sword, if his mother
Veturia, when he was now
readie to charge, had not
disweapond him with weeping.
Yea, as Camillus
himselfe, because in their
conceits hee had not made
the shares of the Veientine
spoiles indifferent, between
the Commonaltie, and the
souldier. But he, a much
better man, did rescue the
besieged in Rome taken, and
reuenged their quarel vpon
the Galls their enemies, to
whom but euen now they
were humble suitours. In

such sort they contended
also with the Se nate it selfe
about settling the rules of

their houses, they threatned
emptinesse, and vtter

the Decemuirs embroiled
the citie
the second time, in the
very heart thereof. Ten
princes elected for that
purpose, had bookt the
lawes cull'd out of such
as were brought from
Greece, at the peoples commandement:
and the
whole rule of Roman iustice
was described by
them in Tenne Tables:
after which though their
commission determined,
they neuerthelesse retained
the soueraigne power,

vpon a tyrannicall humor.
Appius Claudius was
puft vp, more then all his
partners, with so great
pride, as hee secretly resolued
to deflowre a freeborne
virgin, forgetting
Lucretia, forgetting the expulsion
of kings, and the
lawes which himselfe had
enacted. Virginius her
father therefore, when hee
saw his childe by false
practice iudged a bond-woman,
he made no bones
to kill her with his owne
hand, in the face of the
Court; and the companies
of his fellow-souldiers
displaying about him
their banners,admotisque signis commilitonum. they layd
siege, in armes, to that

whole vsurped soueraignetie,
and from mount Auentine,
where their first campe
was, dragd it downe into
the gaole, and fetters.

kindled the
third sedition,A. V. C. CCCVIII. in

for freedome of ioyning in
marriage with the nobles.

                     THe desire of honour
in the commoners,A. V. C. CCCXXCV
who aspired to be
also created magistrates,
mooued the fourth great
stirre. Fabius Ambustus
had two daughters, one of
which hee bestowed in
marriage vpon Sulpitius,
a gentleman of Patritian
bloud, the other vpon Stolo,
a Plebcian. He, because
his wife was frighted at the
sound of the serieants rod
on his doore, which was neuer
heard there, till then,
and for that respect was

proudly enough scoffed-at
by her other sister, brooked
not the indignitie. Therefore
hauing gotten to bee
Tribune, he wrested from
the Senate, whether they
would, or no, the participation
of honors, and high
offices. Neuerthelesse, in
the very hottest of these
distempers, a man shall see
cause to admire the generous
spirit of this princely
people. For so much as
one while they busied
themselues in the rescue of
freedome, another while
of chastitie, then stood for
dignitie of birth, and for
the ensignes, &amp; ornaments
of honour. But of all these
worthie things, there was

not any one ouer which
they held so wakefull an
eye, as ouer libertie; nor
could they bee corrupted
by any gifts, or good turnes,
as a value for betraying it.
For when in a mightie
people, and growing mightier
daily, there were in the
meane space many pernicious
members, of them
they punished Spurius
Cassius, suspected of affecting
souereigntie, because
hee had published the
Agrarian law, &amp; Maelius,
for that hee gaue lauishly,
both of them with present
death. Indeed, his owne
father tooke reuenge vpon
Spurius, but Seruilius
Ahala, master of the Roman
                     
horsemen, or cauallerie,
by comandement of
Quinctius, the Dictator,
ranne his sword through
Maelius, in the middle of
the Forum. But Manlius,
the preseruer of the Capitol,
carrying himselfe, because
hee had freed most
men of their debts, ouer
loftily, and aboue the
garbe of a fellow-citizen,
they pitcht him headlong
from the top of the castell,
which himselfe had defended.
Such were the
people of Rome at home,
and abroad, in peace, and
in warre, during this working
current of their
youth,fretum. the secund age of
their empire, in which

                     WHEN Italie was
now brought
vnder, &amp; made
mannageable,
the people of Rome hauing
continued almost fiue hundred

yeeres, was in good
earnest growne a man: and
if there be any such thing,
as strength, and lustie
youth, then certainely
they were strong, and
young, and began to be
hard enough for all the
world. They therefore
(which is a wonder, and
incredible to be spoken)
who had kept a struggling
at home for wellneere
fiue hundred yeeres
(so difficult it was to set vp
an Head ouer Italy) in onely
the two hundred yeeres
which ensued, marcht thorow
Afrike, Europe, Asia,
and in briefe, thorow the
whole world, with their victorious
armies.

                  The first Carthaginian,
or Punike warre.
                  
                     THe people therefore
conquerours
of Italie,
                     A. V. C. CDXXC IX. after they
had runne thorow all the
length thereof, to the sea it
selfe, like a fire, which hauing
consumed all the
woods in it's way, is broken
off at the bank of some
riuer passing betweene, in
like sort stop a while. But
when they saw within kenn
a wondrous rich bootie
lopt off as it were, and
torne away from their Italie,
they burnt with so extreme
a desire of atchieuing

it, that whereas they
could not come at it by
bridges, nor shut out the
sea, they were resolute to
vnite it to their dominion
by force of armes, and so
to make it againe a parcell
of their continent. But lo,
the destinies willing to open
them a way, there
wanted not a wished occasion,
Messana, a confederate
citie of Sicilia, complayning
of the Carthaginians
out-rages, who aymed at
the conquest of Sicilia, as
well as the Romans, both
of them at the same time,
and with equall affections,
and forces, hauing in proiect
the lordship of the
world. Therefore, for assisting

their associates, that
was the colour, but in very
deed spurred on with loue
of the prey (though the
newnesse of the attempt
troubled them, yet valour
is so full of confidence)
this rude, this shepheardish
people, and meere landmen,
did well shew, that
manhood made no difference
whether it fought
on horse-back, or on shipboord,
vpon the earth, or
waters. Appius Claudius,
Consul, they first
aduentured into those
streights which had beene
made hideous with poëticall
monsters, and where
the current was violent;
but they were so farre

from being deterred thereby,
that they made vse of
the furie of the hurrying
tide as of a fauour: for falling
in therewith, they
forthwith set vpon Hiero,
king of Syracuse, with such
celeritie, that himselfe confest
hee found himselfe ouercome
before hee saw
the enemy. Duilius, and
Cornelius, Consuls, they
durst also fight at sea. And
the speed then vsed to
build, and rigge a nauie
was certainely a signe of
speeding. For within threescore
dayes after the timber
was fell'd, an armada
of one hundred and threescore
saile, ridde at anchor
out of it; so that they seemed

not the worke of shipwrights,
but as if by a kind
of metamorphosis, the
gods had turned them
such, and changed trees to
vessels. But the report
which goes of the fight is
maruelous, where these
slugges, and heauie bottomes
seized vpon the
quick and nimble nauie of
the aduersaries, who were
much more cunning at sea,
so farre as skill to shift aside
oares, and to dally out the
strokes of beake-heads, by
yare, and readie turning.
For the hands of yron, and
other the grappling engines
of the Romans, the enemie
made much sport at, before
the battels ioyned; but

were then compelled to
trie it out in good earnest,
as if they had fought on
firme land. Thus giuing
the ouerthrow at the Iles
of Liparae, their enemies armada
either sunke, or fled,
this was their first sea-triumph.
The ioy whereof,
how great was it? when
Duilius, Captaine generall
in that seruice, not thinking
one daies triumph enough,
did neuer come home from
any supper, so long as hee
liued, but hee would haue
torches borne lighted, and
flutes play before him, as if
hee triumphed euery day.
The losse, in regard of so
great a victorie, was but
light. The other of the

Consuls, Cnaeus Cornelius
Asina, entrapt by the enemie,
vnder colour of parley,
&amp; so surprised, became
a lesson against giuing credit
to the faithlesse Carthaginians.
Calatinus, Dictator,
draue the Carthaginian
garrisons out of Agrigentum,
Drepanum, Panormus,
Eryx, Lilybaeum, well-neere
all they had. The Romans
were once in great feare of
a mischiefe about the forrest
of Camarina, but
through the excellent vertue
of Calpurnius Flamma,
a tribune of souldiers, wee
escaped. For hee, with a
choise band of three hundred,
did beat the enemie
from a ground of aduantage,

which hee had taken,
and meant to haue made
good against vs, holding
play, till our whole armie
was gotten out of danger.
By which his so prosperous
successe, hee matcht
the glory of Leonidas at the
straits of Thermopylae: in
this one point our Calpurnius
more famous then the
other, that hee ouer-liued
the exploit, though he drew
no characters in bloud. Lucius
Cornelius Scipio, when
Sicilia was now become a
purliew, or suburbe-prouince
of the Roman state,
and warre crept farther,
crost ouer into Sardinia,
and Corsica, neighbour Ilands,
where he so affrighted

the inhabitants, by rasing
the citie Carala, and so
vanquisht all the Carthaginians,
or Paenish-men, as
well by land, as sea, that
nothing now was left to be
conquered, but Africa it
selfe. Marcus Atilius Regulus
sayled with warre aboord
him into Africa. Yet
there wanted not some,
who fainted at the terrible
name which the Carthaginian
seas had gotten. Mannius,
the tribune also, augmenting
by his feare this
fearfull conceit, till the Generall
menacing him with
the naked axe, vnlesse hee
obeyed, made him take
heart, and put to sea, for
feare of his head. They

forthwith plyde it with
oare &amp; saile: and the feare
of our comming was such
among the Paenish-men,
that Carthage had almost
set open her gates, and been
taken. The first reward of
this martiall voyage was
the taking of the citie Clypea
(for that stands first in
sight vpon the Punick shore
like a fort, and sentinell)
and aboue three hundred
castles, besides the same,
were sackt, and rased. Nor
fought they only with men
but with monsters also; for
a serpent of prodigious bignesse,
and bred as it were to
take vengeance on behalfe
of Africa, vext our campe
at Bagrada. But Regulus,
                     
who conquerd all things,
hauing spred the terrour of
his name farre, and neare,
multitudes of their youth
slaine, their captaines dead
at his foot, or fast in chains,
his nauie fraighted with infinite
spoiles, which he had
sent heauie laden away to
Rome, as stuffe for triumph,
laid siege to the chiefe seate
of that warre, Carthage itselfe,
and lodged close at
the very gates. Here fortune
wheeld about a little,
only that Rome might haue
the more glories to adorne
it, whose greatnesse is for
the more part most improued
by great mischances.
For the enemies turning
themselues to make vse of

forreine aids, the Lacedemonians
sent them Xantippus
for a Generall, who being
most expert in the Art of
warre, gaue vs a grieuous ouerthrow,
&amp; the most stout
Regulus himselfe (a misfortune
which had neuer hapned
to the Romans before)
fell aliue into the enemies
hands. But he was a man able
to beare so great a distresse:
For his mind could
neither be conquered by
imprisonment, nor with the
message he vndertooke; because,
quite contrary to that
which hee had in charge
from the Carthaginians, he
deliuered his opinion in the
Roman Senate, That they
should not make peace, nor

yeeld exchange of prisoners.
But neither was the maiesty
of the man embased by voluntarie
returne to the foe,
in discharge of his honour,
nor finally, by captiuitie,
nor by nayling on a gibbet
for punishment: nay, all
these things increased the
admiration of him. For what
other thing was all this else,
then that the vanquisht did
triumph ouer the vanquishers;
and though not ouer
Carthage, yet ouer fortunes
selfe? And the Romans were
more eager, &amp; more offensiuely
bent to take reuenge
for Regulus, then to cōpasse
victory. The Carthaginians
therfore bearing their crests
aloft, &amp; the warre comming

back into Sicilia, Metellus
Consul made such a slaughter
of the enemie at Panormus,
that there was no more
stirre in that Iland. An argument
of a most braue day
gained, was the seisure of an
hundred and twentie elephants:
a great prey, had
such an heard been gotten,
not by warre, but by hunting.
Publius Claudius Consull,
the Romans were ouercome,
not by the enemie,
but by the Gods thēselues,
whose ceremonies they had
contemned, their nauie
forthwith sinking in the
place, where he had commanded
the birds to be cast
in, because they had giuen
signes he should not fight.

                     Marcus Fabius Buteo, Consul,
met the enemies nauie
in the African sea, about
Aegymurus, sailing onward
to the inuasion of Italy, and
ouerthrew it. O how great
a triumph perished vtterly
at that time, by stresse of
weather! when the pillage
of the enemies ships, driuen
by diuerse winds, filled the
shores of Africa, the Syrts,
the coasts of all nations,
and the Ilands about, with
wrecks, and ruins. A mighty
losse, but it was not without
some respect to the honour
of the prince of people,
the Romans, that the victorie
was intercepted by
tempest, and the triumph
miscarried by shipwracke.

And yet when the Carthaginian
spoyles floated vp &amp;
downe, and were split vpon
all the capes of land, &amp; Iles
about, the Romans triumpht
notwithstanding.A. V. C. DXII. 
                     Lutatius
Consul, an end was made of
this warre at the Ilands called
Aegates. A soret sea-fight
was there neuer; for
in the enemies armada was
their prouant, their landforces,
their engines, their
weapons, and as it were all
Carthage; which burthen
was their bane: the Romans
nauie, yare, light, vnincumbred,
in one kind like a landcampe,
and in another, like
a fight on horsebacke, they
were so guided with their
oares, as with bridles, &amp; the

gallies themselues seemed
liuing creatures, their
prowes, and beakes nimbly
fitted to strike here,
or there, at pleasure.
The enemies vessels therefore
torne to pieces in a
trice, couer'd all the sea
with their shipwracks betweene
Sicilia, and Sardinia.
So exceeding great
was that victorie, as no
question was moued now
about razing the bulwarks
of their enemies townes. It
seemed friuolous to rage
against the castell, &amp; stonewalls
thereof, when Carthage
it selfe was swallowed
thus in the bottom of
the sea.

a short repose,
such as might serue as
it were to take breath in,
followed: and for a sure
signe of peace, and that
armes were laide aside indeed,
then first after the
dayes of king Numa, the
temple-gate of Ianus was
shut in: but it was forthwith
set open againe. For
the Ligurians,
                     A. V. C. DXVI. the Galls of
Insubria, and the Illyrians
prouoked them, as in like
sort did the nations from
vnder the Alps, that is,

from vnder the very entrances
into Italy, some
one or other of the Gods
daily egging them on, that
the armes of the Romans
might not take dust, or
cancker-fret: to be briefe,
quotidian, and as it were
domestike enemies were as
a schoole of warre to the
young frie of souldiers;
nor did the people of Rome
vse this, or that nation of
them otherwise, then as a
whetstone to sharpen the
edge-toole of their vertue
vpon. The Ligurians
dwelling close vpon the
lowest ridges of the Alpes,
betweene Varus, and the
riuer Macra, sheltred among
wilde thickets, were

more difficult to come at
then to conquer. This
tough, and swift generation
of men, trusting to their
fastnesses, and feet, rather
made inroades by flealth,
like high-way theeues
then an orderly warre.
Therefore, after that the
Deceates, Oxibians, Euburiades,
and Ingaunians, nations
of Liguria, had thus
for a long time shifted for
themselues, by aduantage
of their woods, wayes, and
starting holes, Fuluius at
the last shuts vp their lurking
places with smoake,
and fire, Baebius drawes
them downe into the
champaine, and Posthumius
so disarmed them,

as hee scarcely leaues them
yron enough to shooe a
plough.

who also dwel
vnder the Alps,
had the mindes of wilde
beasts, and bodies huger
then for men. It is neuerthelesse
found true by experience,
that as their first
brunt is more forceable
then a mans, so their second
is weaker then a womans.
Bodies bred about
the Alps vnder a moist
skie, are somewhat answerable

in nature to the snow
of their seats, for so soone
as they waxe hot thorow
with fighting, they forthwith
melt into sweat, and
are as it were dissolued
with the sunne in a moment.
These, as at other
times often, but specially
now, Britomarus being
their captaine, solemnly
swore neuer to vnbuckle
their belts till they had
mounted the Capitoll. It
fell out iust. For Aemilius
hauing the victorie,
vngirdled them in the Capitoll.
Soone after, Ariouistus
their captaine, they
vow'd to consecrate a golden
chaine to their God of
Warre, to be composed of

such spoils as they tooke
from our souldiers. Iupiter
intercepted their vow;
for Flaminius erected a
golden trophea to Ioue of
the chains they wore. Verdumarus
being their king,
they promised to offer the
armours of the Romans
vp to Vulcan; but their
vowes ranne bias. For Verdumarus
was slaine, and
Marcellus hung vp the
third magnificent, &amp; pompous
spoiles, which since
the reigne of Romulus had
beene offred to Iupiter Feretrius.

contenting themselues vnder
the reigne of Queene
Teuta, with spoiles gotten

one heinous act to many
bold ones. For they tooke
our ambassadours, as they
sought for an orderly redresse
by law, in the points

of wrong, and slue them,
not with the sword, but
like beasts of sacrifice with
the butchers axe, burnt
the masters of the shippes,
and to make the matter
fuller of dishonour, all
this in a womans reigne.
Therefore, Cnaeus Fuluius
Centumalus our Generall,
they were brought into
subiection farre, and neere.
So chopping off the chiefe
Lords heads, we sacrificed
to the ghosts of our ambassadours.

                  The second Carthaginian
warre.
                  
                     FOure yeeres were
scarcely now ouerpast
after the
first Carthaginian warre,A. V. C. DXXXV.
when lo, another brake
forth, lesse in respect of the
time (for it lasted not aboue
eighteene yeeres)
but so farre beyond the
former in respect of terrible
ouerthrowes, that if a
man compare the losse
together, which both
the sides sustained, hee
would rather thinke the
victors part to bee the
partie vanquished. The

noble Carthaginians were
ashamed, seeing themselues
thrust out of the
seas possession, and their
Ilands violently taken
from them, and they to
pay tribute, who were
wont to impose it. Herevpon
Annibal, then a boy,
bound himselfe by oath to
his father before the altar,
to take reuenge; wherein
hee was not slacke. Therefore
to beget matter for a
warre, he razed Saguntus to
the ground, an ancient
rich citie of Spaine, and a
great, but grieuous moniment
of her truth, and faith
to the Romans; whose
freedome being by name
prouided for in the generall

                     articles of league, Annibal
seeking causes of new
quarrels, ouerthrew to the
ground, with his owne, and
others hands, that by
breach of peace hee might
open Italy for himselfe.
The Romans make not a
greater conscience of any
thing then of keeping the
faith of leagues. Vpon aduertisement
therefore that
their confederate citie was
besieged, they did not presently
runne to their weapons,
but did rather first
choose to assay by way of
orderly complaint, what
amends could bee had, as
remembring they were also
in amity with Carthaginians.
Meane-while the

                     Saguntines tired with hunger,
batteries, assaults, and
fire, and their constancie
turning into madnesse, and
furie, they make a monstrous
funerall pile in the
most open space of their citie;
and laying then themselues,
and their whole substance
on the top thereof▪
made an end of all together
with sword, and fire.
For this so foule a destruction,
the Romans demanded
the deliuerie vp of
Annibal. But the Carthaginians
paltring in the case,
quoth Fabius, the chiefe
ambassadour of the Romans,
What meanes this
delay? lo, in this lappe I
bring you war, and peace,

choose which of them you
like best, and take it among
you. And when at these
words the voice went
round, hee should giue
them at his pleasure, which
he would; Bee it war then,
said he; and therewithall
flinging open the skirts of
his robe, in the midst of
the Counsel-house, which
hee had gather'd hollow,
and held vp till then, hee
did it with such an horrour
as if hee had indeed powr'd
warre among them out of
his lap, or bosome. The end
of this war was sutable to
the beginning. For as if
the last curses of the Saguntines
in that their publike
self-slaughter, &amp; finall

fire had commanded such
obsequies to bee celebrated,
their ghosts were sacrificed
vnto with the deuastation
of Italy, the captiuitie
of Africa, and the
destruction of kings and
Generals of armies, by
whom that warre was managed.
When as therefore
that sad, and dismall storm,
and tempest of the Carthaginian
warre once stirring
in Spaine, had forged out
of the Saguntine fires, those
lightnings, and thunders,
now long in breeding, and
aim'd at Rome, immediately
then, as carryed with a
whirl-winde, it rusht thorow
the middle of the
Alps, and fell vpon Italy
                     
from the snowie toppe of
those mountaines made
higher then they were of
themselues by fame, and fables,
as if it had beene from
heauen. The first rages of
the charge burst streightway
forth with horrible
violence, betweene the riuer
of Po, and Ticinum.
There, Scipio Generall,
the Roman army was put
to flight, and the Generall
himselfe had falne wounded
as hee was, into the
hands of the enemy, if his
sonne, then wanting of
eighteene yeeres old, had
not rescued his father from
certaine death it selfe with
bold bestriding him. And
this shall bee that Scipio,
                     
who growes vp to the destruction
of Africa, and
shall make a surname to
himselfe out of her calamities.A. V. C. DXXXI.
After this ouerthrow
at Ticinum followed that
of Trebia. This second
storme of warre wrought
the furious effects thereof,
Sempronius Consul. There
the craftie enemies, in a
cold, &amp; snowie day, hauing
first well warm'd themselues
at fires, and suppled
their limbs with oyle, men
(a wonder to bee spoken)
cōming out of the South,
and sun-burnt climats, ouercame
vs at home with
our own winter. The third
lightnings of Annibal flew
randome at vs by Trasimenus
                     
lake, Flaminius our Generall.
There also, the Carthaginians
vented another
new trick of their trade. For
the lake lying hiddē vnder
a thick mist, the cauallerie
shadowed from sight with
twigs, &amp; long osiars which
grew in the marsh, gaue a
suddē charge vpon our rere.
Neuerthelesse wee cannot
blame the enemie, but our
selues. For swarms of bees
which clustred vpō the Romā
                     
ensigns, their gilt eagles
vnwilling to come out, and
an huge earthquake at the
ioyning of the battels, all of
thē vnlucky signes, had forewarned
our rash Generall
of the euent, and preuented
it, but that the concourse

of the horse, &amp; foot, &amp; the
extraordinary lowd clashing
of their weapons gaue
to Flaminius alone the honor
of leading them on, against
the other Consuls liking.
The fourth, &amp; the almost
deadly wound of the
empire was at Cannae, an
obscure village of Apulia,
but through the greatnesse
of the blow which was receiued
there, it got to be famous
at the cost of fortie
thousand liues. In that
place the General himselfe,
earth, heauen, the day, and
all things else consented to
the fall of that vnfortunate
army. For Annibal not content
to haue put counterfeit
fugitiues vpon vs, who

                     seeing their vantage, forthwith
set vpon our men at
their backs, but that most
dangerous captaine hauing
moreouer in the open
fields, markt the nature of
the place where the sunnebeams
did beat hottest, the
dust was infinite, and the
easterne winde blew stint
as it were, he so marshall'd
his battels, that the Romans
standing with their faces
towards all these disaduantages,
himselfe had the
whole fauour of the skie,
the winde, the dust, &amp; sun
at once to fight for him.
The enemies therfore were
so glutted with the execution
of two most mighty
hosts, that Annibal himself

bade his souldiers, spare the
sword. Of the two Consuls,
the one fled, the other was
slaine; hard to say, whether
of them the more braue
therein. Aemilius ashamed
to suruiue, Varro despaired
not of better. Signes of the
greatnes of the ouerthrow
were these, the riuer Aufidus
ran bloud for a while,
a bridge of dead carcases
made at Annibals commā
                     demēt
ouer Gellus brooke,
two bushels of gold rings
sent to Carthage, and the
estimate of Roman gentlemen
slaine, calculated not
by tale, but measure. It was
then past all doubt, that
Rome had seene her last
day, &amp; that Annibal, within

fiue dayes, might haue
feasted in the Capitol, if (as
the Carthaginian, Maharbal,
Bumilcar's sonne, is reported
to haue said) Annibal
had as well vnderstood
how to make vse of
his victory, as how to obtaine
it. But, as the common
voice goeth, either
the fate of Rome ordain'd
to bee empresse of the
earth, or Annibals euill
Genius, or the Gods of Carthage
now auerted, carried
him a diuerse way. For
when hee might haue put
his victory home, he rather
made choise to enioy it, &amp;
suffred Rome to rest, while
hee progrest to Campania,
&amp; Tarent, where both he,

and his armie lost, by, and
by their spirit so, as it was
truly said, that Capua was
Annibals Cannae. For him
whom neither the Alps,
nor force of armes could
daunt, Campania alone, and
the delicate warme springs
of Baiae did (who would
beleeue it?) subdue. Meanwhile
the Romans tooke
breath, and rise as it were
from death to life againe.
Weapons wanted: they
tooke them downe out of
the temples. Fresh souldiers
wanted: they minister
the oath of warre to their
bondmen, and make them
free. Treasure wanted: the
lords of the counsell bring
gladly all they had, leauing

no gold to themselues,
but what was in their
brooches, belts, and rings:
the knights, and gentlemen
followed the Senatours
example, and the
comoners the gentlemens:
to bee briefe, Leuinus, and
Marcellus Consuls, such abundance
of riches was
brought together out of
priuate contributions for
the publike seruice, that the
eschequer had scarcely
bookes, and clerks enow
to enter the particulars.
What shall we say of them
at this time, in the choise of
magistrats? how great was
the wisdome of the centuries,
or hundred-men, when
the yonger sort askt coūsel

of the ancient, whom they
should nominate for Consuls?
For it stood them vpon,
not to deale with faire
force onely against so cunning
an enemie, who had so
often beaten them, but to
meet with him also in his
owne policies. The first
hope of their empires recouerie,
and, as I may say,
reuiuall thereof, was Fabius,
who inuented a new
method of vanquishing Anibal,
Not to fight. And
from hence it was, that in
happie time for Rome hee
got the nick-name, to bee
called, The draw-backe, or
Cunctator: and from hence
it came, that the people stiled
him, The shield of the
                     
state. Hee therefore so
ground and punned Annibal,
by coasting him thorow
all Samnium, the forrests
of Falernus, and Gaurus,
that whom plaine
strength could not breake
in pieces, delay might fret,
and weare. Soone after,
Claudius Marcellus, Generall,
they durst also encounter
him, came hand to
hand, draue him out of his
Campania, and forced him
to rayse his siege from before
Nola. They durst in
like sort, Sempronius Gracchus
Generall, pursue him
thorow Lucania, and set
vpon his backe in his retreat;
though, O the shame!
the Romans were compelled

to fight with the hands
of their bondslaues. O the
horrible confidence of a
people, among so many
aduersities! O the high
haughtinesse, and brauerie
of their spirit, in their so
extreme &amp; afflicted estate,
that being doubtfull of keeping
Italy, they durst notwithstanding
tend to other
places; and when their enemies
flew vp and downe
at their throats, ouer all
Campania, and Apulia, and
made halfe Afrike in Italie,
did both at one time beare
the brunt of his assaults,
and at the same time dispatched
forces into Sicilia,
Sardinia, Spaine, and other
parts of the world. Marcellus
                     
was sent into Sicilia,
which held not out long:
for the power of the whole
Iland was put apart into
one citie. Syracusae, that
great, and till that time, vnconquered
chiefe-towne,
though defended by the
wit of Archimedes, did
yeeld at last. Her treble
wall, alike number of castles,
her hauen of marble,
and her fountaine Arethusa,
so farre renowned, what
auayled they other then
thus farre onely, that the
citie was spared, in respect
of her beautie? Gracchus
seized Sardinia: neyther
did the wildnesse of the Ilanders,
nor the monstrous
cragges of their mad mountaines

(for so they were
called) stand them in any
stead. A terrible course
was taken with their cities,
and with their Citie of cities,
Caralis, that the headstrong
nation, scarce worth
killing, might bee tamed
at last with the lacke of
their natiue soyle. The
two Scipio's, Cnaeus, and
Publius, sent into Spaine,
had pluckt away once all
hope from the Carthaginians,
but lost their hold againe,
being destroyed by
the cunning inuentions of
the aduersarie. The Scipio's
had gotten indeede
great dayes, when they
gaue ouerthrowes; but the
one of them was circumuented

and slaine by their
dangerous deuices, as hee
was busie to entrench; and
the other of them, hauing
fled into a tower, was ouerwhelmed
frō round about
with fire-brands. That
Scipio therefore, who dispatcht
with an armie into
Spaine, to reuenge his father,
and his vncles death,
was the man to whom the
fates decreed so great a surname
out of the conquest
of Africa, recouered all
Spaine, that braue martiall
countrey, ennobled for
cheualrie, and men of the
sword, that seed-plot of
the enemies armies, that
schoole-mistresse of Annibal
himselfe; he conquered
                     
all of it, I say (though incredible
to say it) from the
pillars of Hercules to the
Ocean, and I know not
whether more speedily, or
more easily: the speed,
foure yeeres speake; the
easinesse, one onely citie
manifesteth, being taken
vpon the same day in
which it was besieged; and
it was a fortunate signe of
Africa's conquest to ensue,
that Carthage in Spaine
was so easily taken. Certaine
it is notwithstanding,
that the admirable continencie
of the Generall was
of greatest force to subdue
the prouince: for he restored
their yong sonnes, and
daughters, were they neuer

so pleasing, or faire, back
to the barbarous, without
permitting them to come
in his sight, that hee might
not seeme to haue once sipt
or skimd the honour of
their chastitie so much, as
with beholding them. This
was then the carriage of
the Romans in diuers countreys
abroad, who yet, for
all that, could not be rid of
Annibal, who stuck close to
them in the bowels of Italie;
for most nations had
reuolted vnto him, and
himselfe, a most smart and
excellent captaine, vsed
Italian forces against Italy.
We neuerthelesse had triced
him out of most of her
townes and countries. Tarentus
                     
came in againe of it
selfe. Capua, the seat, dwelling
house, and the other
as it were, Carthage of Annibal,
was now also gayned
backe, the losse whereof so
greatly grieued the man,
that thereupon hee turned
all his strengths vpon Rome.
O people, worthie to bee
lords of the earth, worthie
of all fauour, and to
haue the gouernment of
the affaires of men, and
gods! Driuen to the worst
of feares, yet gaue they not
ouer their enterprise, and
doubtfull how to keepe
their owne citie, they, for
all that, quitted not Capua,
but entrusting a part of
their armie to Appius Consull,

and the residue following
Flaccus into Rome,
they fought where they
were not, as well as where
they were. Why wonder
we therefore? For Annibal
encamping within three
miles of Rome, was resisted
by the Gods (nor will I
shame to confesse it) I say
by the Gods themselues,
because such store of raine
fell at euery remoue of his,
that he seemed put backe
by diuine prouision; not as
in defence of heauen, but
to keepe him off from the
citie-walls, and Capitol. Hee
therefore departed, &amp; fled,
and retired into the farthest
nooke of Italy, hauing done
all he could against Rome,
                     
sauing only giuen it assault.
It is but a trifle to speake of,
but yet of much efficacie,
to shew the magnanimitie
of the Romans, in that the
very field it selfe, where
Annibal encamped, being,
during the siege, set to sale,
found a chapman. On the
other side, Annibal, to imitate
their confidence, cryed
the goldsmiths row in the
citie, but no man would
buy of him. And thus we
may see there were presages
enow. But so great
vertue of men, and so much
fauour of the Gods came to
nothing. For Asdrubal,
brother of Annibal, came
out of Spaine with a new
armie, new strengths, new

weight of warre. Rome had
beene vndoubtedly quite
ruined, had that man ioyned
with his brother: but
Claudius Nero, and Liuius
Salinator, vtterly distrest
him as he was encamping,
Nero kept Annibal off in
the farthest corner of Italy.
Liuius marcht with ensigns
spred, into the quite opposite
quarter, that is, vp to
the very iawes of the first
descence from the Alpes into
Italie, the distance as
great, from our other camp,
as all the length of Italie.
It is not easie to say, with
what high wit, and speed,
the two Consuls vnited
their campes, and giuing
battell to Asdrubal, not

aware of that vnion, destroid
him vtterly, Annibal
al this while not once dreaming
what was done. Sure
it is, that when the newes
came to Aniball, and hee
saw his brothers head tost
out before his trenches, I
acknowledge (quoth hee)
the vnluckines of Carthage.
This was the mans first
confession, not without a
sure presage of the fate
which hung ouer his head.
And now it was certaine
out of Anibals own mouth,
that Aniball might be vanquished.
But the people of
Rome, full of confidence, after
so many fortunate successes,
held it a gallant attempt
to make an end of

the quarrell, with the sorest
enemie they had, and
that at his owne home, in
Africa.
                     A. V. C. DXLIX. 
                     Scipio therefore
captain general, they transported
thither the whole
weight of warre, beginning
to imitate Aniball, and to
pay him backe in his Africa,
for the mischiefes hee
did in their Italy. O yee
Gods! what forces of Asdruball,
what armies of
king Syphax did hee ouerthrow?
what, and how
great were those two
camps, which hee in one
night consumed with fire?
To conclude, hee was not
now within three miles of
Carthage, as Aniball had
beene of Rome, but battred

besieged gates themselues
therof: and thereby wrung
Aniball out of Italie, vpon
which hee lay hard,
and heauie. Since Rome
stood, there was neuer a
grater day then that, in
which, two the most famous
captaines that euer
were before, or since, the
one of them, conquerour
of Italy, the other of Spain,
confronted each the other
in battle-ray. But yet they
came first to a parley about
articles of peace: at which
both of them stood a good
while without speaking a
word, as if mutuall admiration
had fixt them to the
ground. But when they
could not agree vpon a

peace, the trumpets sound
a charge. It is cleare, by
confession of both parties,
that no armies could bee
better marshall'd, nor any
battell be sorer fought, as
Scipio reported of Anibal's
armie, and Anibal of
Scipio's. But Aniball notwithstanding
gaue place,
and Africa became the
conquerours reward, and,
after Africa, the whole
earths empire also.

                  The first Macedonian, or
Philippian Warre.
                  
                     NOne thought it now
a shame to be ouercome,
when Carthage
was. Macedonia,
Greece, Syria, and all other
nations, as if carried with a
certaine current, and torrent
of fortune, by and by
followed Africa. But the
first who followed were
the Macedonians, a people
which had once affected
the worlds Monarchie.
Though therefore a Philip
was king then, the Romans
notwithstanding seemed to
thēselues to haue to deal in
him with great Alexander.
                     
The Macedonian warre was
greater in the name therof,
then was answerd in the
performances of the nation:
The cause of the war grew
by reason of the league
which Philip had made
with Anibal, hauing then
a long while tyrannized Italie:
which cause increased
when the Athenians implored
aide against Philips
iniuries, in which, exceeding
the rights of victorie, hee
shewed his rage vpon temples,
altars, and moniments
of the dead; The Senate
thought good to minister
succour to so noble suitors:
For the kings of countreys,
Captaines generall, common-weales,
and nations,

had sought to this citie for
protection: Laeuinus therefore
Consul, the people
of Rome then first entred
the Ionian sea, and trended
along the whole coast of
Greece, with, as it were a
triumphant nauie: for they
aduanced in open view the
spoyles of Sycilie, Sardinia,
and Africa, and a laurell
growing vnplanted out of
the sterne of the Admirall
promised manifest victory.
Attalus, king of Pergamus,
came in with aids to vs of
his owne accord. There
came also the Rhodians,
expert men at Sea, and
with them on the water,
and with horse, and foote
on land, the Consul made

all to shake. The king twice
ouercome, twice put to
flight, twice stript out of
his campe, yet nothing was
so terrible to the Macedonians
as the sight itselfe
of their wounds, which
being not made with darts,
or arrowes, nor with any
Greekish weapons, but with
huge iauelins, and swords
as huge, were wider then
death had neede of. Verily,
Flaminius Generall,
wee pierced through the
Chaonian mountaynes, till
then impassable, wee passed
the riuer Pindarus, running
through broken places,
and brake through the
very barres themselues of
Macedonia; into which to

haue entred, was it selfe
a victorie. For from that
day forward, the king neuer
daring to trie his fortune
in battell againe, was
vanquisht at the dogges-heads,
or the hillocks called
Cynocephalae, and that
in only one encounter, or
petie skirmish, rather then
a foughten field, the Consull
granting him to bee in
peace, and leaue to enioy
his kingdome. And to
take away all prints, or
tokens of hostilitie; hee
repressed Thebes, and Eubaea,
and the immoderate
enterprises of the Lacedaemonians
vnder Nabis; and
restored the Greekes to
their ancient state, that

they might liue after their
owne Lawes, and bee as
free as their fore-fathers.
O what reioycements were
then! O what comfortable
cryes! when this proclamation
was made by
the publike officer in the
theater of Nemea, at the
Quinquennal, or fiue-yeerly
playes! O what were
the showts, and clamours!
what abundance of flowrs
sprinkled vpon the Consul!
yea, they made the
Herald speake out that
sweet word againe, and againe,
which pronounced
Achaia free; nor did they
otherwise relish that proclamation,
or edict of the
Consull, then as they would

haue done some excellently
pleasing lesson plaide vpon
soft wind-instruments, or
violins.

                  The warre in Syria with
king Antiochus.
                  
                     PResently after the
Macedonians,
                     A. V. C. DLXI. and
king Philip, Antiochus
tooke his turne to bee
conquerd, by a kinde of
chance, fortune, as it were
of purpose, so marshalling
matters, that as the Roman
empire went forward by
degrees from Africke into
Europe; it might also

roll from Europe, into Asia,
causes of warre offering
themselues without seeking,
that the course of victorie
might saile onward in
order as the world stood
sited. There was no warre
of which there went so terrible
a fame as of this. For
those Persians, who were of
old, the eastern world, Xerxes,
and Darius, came then
to minde, in whose dayes
mountaines were cut thorow,
and the sea was couerd
with failes. Besides this,
certaine prodigious signes
which seemed to threaten
somewhat from heauen,
bred terrour; for Apollo
at Cumae was in a continuall
sweate. But this

was nothing else saue
the God-heads agonie in
fauour of his beloued
Asia. Nor, to say truth,
did any countrey so abound
with mony, riches,
and munition, as Syria:
but they were all in the
hands of so cowardly a
king, as could glorie in nothing
more, then that hee
was ouercome by the Romans.
Antiochus was thrust
into this warre, vpon the
one side by Thoas, chiefe of
the Aetolians, seeking in
vaine to draw the Romans
into an honourlesse league
with him against the Macedonians;
and vpon the other
side Annibal, who being
foil'd in Africa, a fugitiue

also, and impatient
of peace, sought ouer the
world where to finde out
an enemy of the Roman
people. And what manner
of danger might that
haue proued, had that king
giuen himselfe ouer to his
directions? if Annibal, now
quite downe, had beene
trusted with the power of
Asia? But Antiochus,
relying vpon his owne abilities,
and the title of a
king, held it enough that
hee moued warre by himselfe.
Europe did now
without controuersie belong
to the Romans. Antiochus
demanded backe
the citie of Lysimachia, vpon
the coast of Thrace,
                     
built in Europe by his ancestors,
as a parcell of his
inheritance. With this as
it were starre, or constellation,
the tempest of the
Asian warre being stirred,
kings assembling in extraordinarie
number; and defiance
brauely giuen, when
Antiochus had thus wakened
all the humours of
Asia with wonderfull
noise, and tumult, hee betooke
himselfe to sports, &amp;
wanton pleasures, as if hee
had already gotten the
garland. The Iland Eubaea
was diuided from the
maine land with Eurypus,
a narrow sea hauing many
ebbes, and flowes. here Antiochus
pitching his pauilions

of silke, and gold,
hard vpon the brinke of
the murmuring sea, at the
sound of flutes, and other
musick, and though it were
winter, yet had hee roses
brought fresh from all
parts, and lest hee should
in nothing seeme to play
the captaine, he tooke musters
of fine young boyes,
and girls. Such a king
therefore as this, whom his
owne riotous humours
had already conquer'd, the
people of Rome, assailing
that Iland, by Marcus
Atilius Glabrio, Consul, at
the very first bruit of approach
was glad to flie the
place. And albeit he had
gotten to so notable a

steepe passage as that of
Thermopylae (euer to bee
glorious in the death of
those three hundred Lacedaemonians)
yet not dating
to trust that strength
the Romans made him giue
way aswell at land, as sea.
Without delay he returns
into Asia. The charge of
his nauie roial hee committed
to Polyxenes, and
Annibal. For himselfe
could not endure so much
as to looke vpon a fight.
So his whole force at sea
was torne in pieces by the
gallies of Rhodes, our Aemilius
Regillus their Admiral.
That Athens may
not flatter it selfe, we ouercame
Xerxes in Antiochus,
                     
in Aemilius wee matcht
Themistocles, and did as
great an exploit in taking
Ephesus, as the Greekes did
in taking Salamina. At that
time Scipio Consul, his
brother, that Scipio Africanus
who had so lately
conquer'd Carthage, seruing
voluntary vnder him
there, as lieutenant generall,
it seemed good to
make an end of that warre.
The king was already beaten
out of the sea, but wee
goe farther. Our campe is
pitcht at the riuer Meander,
and the mountaine
Sipylus. It is incredible to be
spoken what powers of his
owne, and of his friends
the king had there. Three

hundred thousand foot,
and not a lesse number of
horse, and of seithed chariots;
besides these, elephants
of an huge size, glittering
in gold, purple, siluer,
and their owne iuorie,
stood as bulwarks on both
hands of the battell. But
all these preparations were
hindred by their owne
confusiue greatnesse, and
with a showre, which
powring suddenly downe
did, most luckily for vs,
wet, and weaken the strings
of the Persian bowes.
There was first a feare, by
and by a flight, and then a
triumph. Antiochus ouercome,
and humbling himselfe,
it pleased the Romans
                     
to vouchsafe him peace, &amp;
a piece of his owne kingdome,
so much the more
willingly, because hee had
so easily giuen it ouer.

                     THe Aetolian warre
succeeded,A. V. C. DLXIV. as good
reason would, to
this of the Syrian. For Antiochus
thus brought vnder
foot, the Romans prosecuted
the vnquencht firebrands
of the Asian warre.
Therefore Fuluius Nobilior
had in commission to
execute that reuenge, who
forthwith layes siege vnto,
                     
and batters Ambracia, the
citie roial of king Pyrrhus.
Yeelding followed. The
Athenians, and Rhodians
became intercessours for
the Aetolian. And wee
were mindefull of their
friendship. So it pleased
vs to pardon them. But the
warre crept on farther to
the neighbour places about,
of Cephalaenia, Zacynthus,
and all the Iles in that
sea, betweene the Ceraunian
mountaines, and the
cape of Maleum, accessory
members of the Aetolian
warre.

                     A. V. C. DLXXVI. whose
side they had lately taken.
The beginnings of the war
were successefull to the
foe, but were withall the
cause of their destruction.
For after they had entred
the Roman campe, by force,
and were masters of a gallant
bootie, Caius Claudius
Pulcher sets vpon them afresh,
as they were for the
most part in their iollitie
at sports, and banquets,
and so vomited-vp the
victorie they had gotten,

with their bloud, and liues
together. Apulo himselfe,
their king, being shifted away
on horsebacke, and
tumbling downe drunke
oftentimes, ouerswaid as
hee was with surfeit, and
swimming in the head,
was hardly at last brought
to vnderstand hee was a
prisoner, when he came to
himselfe.

                     THe ruin of Syria
drew the Gallo-Graecians
also after
it.A. V. C. DLXIV. They had sided with
Antiochus, It is doubtfull,

whether Manlius was greedie
of a triumph, or fained,
for gaining it, that hee had
seene them in person; howsoeuer,
hee, though victorious,
was certainely denyed
to triumph, because the
Senate approued not the
cause of the warre. Those
Gallo-Graecians, as their
compound name sheweth,
were a mixt and mongrell
people; being the remains
of those Galls which had
wasted Greece vnder Brennus,
and proceeding castward
still, seated thēselues
in the middle of Asia. As
therefore the seeds of plants
alter kinde by shifting soil,
so their naturall fiercenesse
was mollifide with the delicacies

of Asia. They were
broken, and put to flight in
two battels, though vpon
our comming they abandon'd
their habitations, &amp;
retired themselues among
the highest of their mountaines,
which the Tolistoboges,
and Tectosages had
now possessed. Beaten
from both sides of their couert
with slings, and shot
of arrowes, they submitted
themselues to a perpetuall
peace. But they were kept
bound by occasion of a
kinde of wonder, when
they would haue bitten, &amp;
torne their bonds in sunder
with their teeth, each offering
to the other his
throat to choak. For Chiomara,
                     
wife of Orgiagon, a
pettie king of theirs, rauished
by a Roman captaine,
gaue a memorable example
of wiuely vertue, for she
cut off the fellowes head
from his shoulders, and
escaping from her guard,
brought it to her Lord, &amp;
husband.

or the second Macedonian.
                  
                     THough nations after
nations were
pluckt into subiection
by the ruin which the
Syrian warre drew with it,

yet Macedonia lifted vp her
head again. The memory,
&amp; remembrance of what
they had once been noble,
would not suffer that most
valiant nation to bee in
quiet, and Perses succeeded
to king Philip, who bearing
the same mind, thoght
it stood not with the honour
of his countrey, to
haue it made vassall for euer.
The Macedonians
brake forth far more violently
vnder him then vnder
his father. Forthey had
drawn the Thracians to be
a part of their strengths,
and so they made a temper
in their discipline of warre
betweene the boistrous
qualities of Thrace, &amp; the

diligence of Macedonia.
Hereunto the kings owne
policies gaue helpe, who
making the top of mount
Aemus his station, tooke a
view from thence of all his
confines, &amp; so wall'd Macedonia
euery-where in
with men, &amp; munition, by
planting castels in abrupt
places, as there seemed no
way left for enemies to inuade
his Macedonia, vnles
it were from out of the
clowds. But Quintus Marcius
Philippus, Consul, the
people of Rome entring
that prouince, after they
had carefully first searcht
al the passages, got through
by the marshes of Ascuris,
&amp; those sharp, &amp; lofty places,

                     doubtfull whether hils,
or skie, ouer which it seemed
the very fowles of the
ayre could not find a way,
and came powring downe
vpon the king with a thunder-crack
of war, as hee sat
secure, and dreamt of no
such matter. His affright
was such, that he caused all
his mony to be drown'd in
the sea, for safety; and al his
ships to bee fired, to keepe
them frō burning. When
greater, and thicker garrisons
were afterwards planted
to guard the passages against
vs, Paulus Consul,
other waies were inuented
to conquer Macedonia; the
Consul, with admirable
wit, and industry, offering

at one place, and breaking
in at another, whose comming
it selfe was so terrible
to Perses, as hee durst not
bee present at the seruice,
but committed the war to
bee managed by his captains.
Therfore ouercome
in absence, he fled to sea, &amp;
to the Iland there of Samothrace,
relying vpon the
priuileges of that sanctuarie;
as if temples, and altars
could protect the man,
whom his sword &amp; mountaines
could not. There
was neuer any king did
longer retaine the conscience
of his lost estate; for
when hee wrote to the Roman
Generall from out of
the temple whither hee

was fled,nomenque epistolae notaret. and styled the letter,
he put himselfe downe
in it by the name of king.
Neither was euer any one
more reuerently respectiue
of captiue maiestie then
Paulus, for the enemy cō
                     ming
into sight, hereceiued
him into the temple, and
admitted him to his feasts,
warning his sons to stand
in awe of fortune, that was
able to doe such things vnto
the mighty. Among all
the most goodly triumphs
which the Roman people
led, and saw, this ouer Macedonia
was chiefe, as that
which tooke vp three
whole dayes with the
shew, vpon the first of
which were statues, and

pictures presented; vpon
the second, warlike furnitures,
and money; and vpon
the third, the captiues,
among whom was king
Perses himselfe, who not
as yet recouer'd out of his
amazement, was as a man
astonished with the vnexpected
euil. But the people
of Rome felt the ioy of the
glory, long before the arriuall
of the conquerours
letters which brought the
newes: for vpon the same
day in which king Perses
was ouercome, it was
knowne at Rome. Two
youngmen mounted on
white coursers, washt off
their dust and bloud at the
lake Iuturna. These broght

the tidings, and were generally
thought to be Castor,
and Pollux, because they
were a paire; to haue been
at the battell, because they
were gorie; and to haue
come fresh out of Macedonia,
because they were
panting hot as yet.

subdued
them in an instant. It was
enough, that he razed Scodra,
their principall citie.
The whole nation did
forthwith yeeld it selfe. To
bee briefe, this warre was
made an end of, before
they at Rome did heare it

                  The third Macedonian
warre with Andriscus.
                  
                     THE Carthaginians,
                     A. V. C. DCV.
and Macedonians,
as if it were
agreed vpon betweene
them, each to bee thrice

ouercome, tooke armes
againe by a kinde of fate,
both of them about a time.
But the first who threw
the yoake off, were the
Macedonians, by so much
harder to be reduced then
before, while it was held a
matter of nothing to reduce
thē. The cause of the war
is in a manner to be blusht
at. For Andriscus, a very
base fellow, vnknown whether
a free man, or a bond,
certainely one who tooke
pay, did enter vpon the
quarrel, and kingdome at
once. And for that hee, being
but a meere counterfeit,
was notwithstanding called
Philip by the people,
by reason of resemblance,

it filled his kingly shape,
and kingly name, with a
kingly spirit also. Therefore,
while the people of
Rome, contemning these
matters, employed no
greater a person against
him, then Iuuentius, a
Praetor, they rashly venter
on a man strong at that
time, not onely in Macedonians,
but in huge
ayds out of Thrace. Wherby
they, otherwise inuincible,
were ouercome in
battell, not by true, and
very kings, but this phantastike,
and playerly one.
But Metellus, another
Praetor, tooke a most
sound reuenge for the
losse of Iuuentius, and

of the legion which hee
commanded: for hee both
cōdemn'd Macedonia to the
state of bondage, &amp; brought
Andriscus in chaynes to
Rome, deliuerd vp into our
hands, by that Vaiuod, or
pety king of Thrace, to
whom hee had fled for succour:
fortune neuerthelesse
shewing him thus much
fauour in his miseries, that
the Romans carryed him
aswell in triumph, as if hee
had beene a king indeede.

                  The third Carthaginian, or
Punicke warre.
                  
                     THe third war against
Africa was short in
respect of the time
(for it was but foure yeeres
worke) and,A. V. C. DCIV. in comparison
of the other two, the least
in labour. For the fight
was not so much with the
men, as with the citie it
selfe, the euen whereof
was certainely the greatest
that could bee: for it made
an end of Carthage. To
comprehend in minde the
summe of those three times
it was thus, in the first, the
warre was begun, in the second

it was driuen away out
of our coasts, in the third it
was ended. The cause of
this last warre was, for that,
contrary to the articles of
league, the Carthaginians
had once prepared an army
at land and sea, against the
Numidians, and often terrifide
the borders of Masinassas
kingdome. Wee bare
fauour to this good and
friendly king. When the
war was settled, the Senate
debated what should become
of Carthage. Cato,
whose hatred admitted no
satisfaction, would haue it
vtterly rased: but when the
Consull demanded anothers
opinion, Scipio Nasica
stood to haue it preserued,

lest the feare of a riuall citie
remoued, the felicitie of
Rome might growe ouer-ranke,
and riotous. The
Senate made choise of a
middle way, which was, to
remoue the citie out of her
old seate. For nothing seemed
to them more honorable,
then to haue such a
Carthage as should not bee
feared. Manilius therefore,
and Censorinus, Consuls, the
people of Rome inuading
Carthage, the nauie thereof
(which vpon ouerture of
peace they willingly yeelded)
was, in sight of the citie,
fired. Then calling
foorth the princes, they
commanded them, vppon
perill of their heads, to depart

the countrey. Which
blacke decree kindled so
great choler in them, as
they resolued to endure the
worst that could be, rather
then obey it. Lamentations
hereupon did forthwith fill
the citie, and the crie went
round, To ARMES, the
finall resolution beeing,
whatsoeuer came of it, to
rebell. Not for that they
had now any hope left to
free themselues, but because
they held it better that
Carthage should bee ruind
by their owne hands, then
their enemies. The furie
of the rebels may be coniectured
by this, that they
pluckt downe house-tops,
and houses, with that timber
                     
to build a new nauie;
for want of yron &amp; brasse,
their smiths wrought gold,
and siluer into armour; and
the matrons clipt the haire
of their heads to make cordage
for engins. Mancinus
Consull, the siege waxt hot
both at land, and sea. The
hauen of the fortifications,
and the first, and second
wal were dismantled, when
the castle notwithstanding,
called The Byrs, made such
a resistance as if it had been
another citie. Though
there was no doubt of ouerthrowing
it, yet the Scipio's
seemd ordaind by destinie
for that purpose. The
people therefore of Rome
require to haue a Scipio for

accomplishing that warre.
And that was the sonne of
Paulus, conquerour of Macedonia,
whom the sonne of
that great Scipio Africanus
had adopted, to vphold
the glory of his house, with
this intention of the fates,
that the citie which the
grandfather had humbled,
the grand child should subuert.
The enemies being
shut vp within the castle,
the Romans sought also to
cut off the sea. But the Carthaginians
digge out a new
hauen vpon another side of
the towne, not to flie out
at, for no man did beleeue
they could escape, but from
the which a new armada
issued, as if it had growne

vp suddainely of it selfe.
Meane-while no day, nor
night went ouer their
heads, in which some new
worke, some new engine,
some new band of forlorne
fellowes appeared not, like
so many sodaine flashes of
flame rising out of cinders,
after the fire hath been buried
in ouerwhelming rubbish.
But things at last
growing absolutely desperate,
fortie thousand men
yeelded themselues, and,
that which you would
scarce thinke, Asdruball
was the first man of them.
How much more boldly
did a woman, the wife of
the captaine? who taking
her two children, threwe

herselfe with them from
the top of the house into
the middle of the fires, following
that Queenes example,
which had founded
Carthage. How mightie a
citie was destroid, may by
the long continuance of the
burning (to let other arguments
goe) be conuinced.
For the fire which the enemies
themselues had kindled
of their owne accord in
their dwellings, and temples,
with intent, that so
much of the citie as they
were not able to deliuer
from the Roman triumphs,
might be consumed, could
not be extinguished in seuenteene
whole dayes together.

                        COrinth,
                     A. V. C. DCVI. the Metropolis
of Achaia, presently
followed the
fortune of Carthage, as if
that were an age for subuersion
of cities, Corinth, the
beauty of Greece, is situated
vpon a narrow necke of
land betweene the Ionian,
and Aegaean seas, as a spectacle,
or pageant. it was destroyed
(alas the wrong!)
before it was registred in
the list of proclaimed enemies.
Critolaus was the cause
of this warre, who made vse
of the freedome giuen by
the Romans, against the Romans,
                     
and it being vncertain
whether hee did not also
strik their ambassadors with
the hand, he for certain did
it with his tongue. Metellus
therefore, chiefely busie in
ordering the affaires of Macedonia,
had now this also
added to his charge, to take
reuenge. From hence grew
the Achaian warre, and
Metellus, Consull, had the
chase, and execution of Critolaꝰ
his first forces, through
the open fields of Elis all
along the bankes of Alpeus.
One battell made an end of
the warre. And now the
citie it selfe was begirt with
a siege, when, as the fates
would haue it, Mummius
came to the victory, which

                     Metellus had foughten for.
Mummius, by the aduantage
of that honour which the
other had atchieued, vanquisht
the enemies armie
at the very entrance of the
Isthmus, or land-necke, and
dyed the heauens on each
side thereof with bloud.
Finally, the inhabitants abandoning
the citie, it was
first sackt, and then at sound
of trumpet quite defaced.
What store of statues, rich
garments, and goodly moniments
in tables were torn
downe, burnt, and cast about?
what riches were
carred away, and fired, you
may from hence coniecture
that al the Corinthian brasse
which is at this day so

much commended through
the world, is found to bee
but the remayne of these
consumings: for the violence
vsed against this most
wealthy citie set an higher
rate vpon the brasse therof,
because multitudes of statues,
and pictures, consisting
of brasse, gold, and siluer,
melting in the fire, the
veines of the metall ranne
in one, and mixt together.

                  Acts done in Spaine.
                  
                     
                        AS Corinth followed
Carthage, so Numantia
followed Corinth.
And it was not long first, before

no part of the world
was free from armes. After
these two most famous Cities
were consumed, warre
did spread it selfe euery
where about, nor that by
turnes in places, but together,
as though it were
but one warre ouer all, so
that the whirling flames
thereof seemed carryed about
ouer the whole earth,
as if dispersed with windes.
Spaine neuer had a disposition
to rise vniuersally against
vs, nor at any time
a minde to put all her
strengths into one, either
for trying mastries, or for
maintayning her libertie
in common, being otherwise
so inuironed with seas,

and with the Pyrenaean hils,
that by aduantage of her
situation shee had beene
inaccessible. But the Romans
had enstraitned her
before she was aware thereof,
and was of all other
prouinces the onely one,
which neuer vnderstood
her owne abilities till shee
was conquerd. The warre
lasted here almost two hundred
yeeres, from the times
of the first Scipio's till Caesar
Augustus, not continually,
or cohaerently, but
as causes were ministred:
nor with Spaniards at first,
but with the Carthaginians,
or Penish-men in Spaine.
Thence grew the contagion,
connexion, and cause

of the warres. The first
Roman ensignes which euer
were displayd ouer the
toppe of the Pyraenees, the
two Scipio's, Publius, and
Cnaeus aduanced, and in terrible
great battels slew Anno,
and Asdrubal the brother
of Anibal, so as all
Spaine had beene conquerd
in a moment, had not those
most gallant gentlemen,
supplanted by the Arts
of Africa, beene destroyd
in their owne victorie, after
they had gotten the
vpper hand both at land,
and sea. That Scipio therefore,
who was shortly afterwards
surnamed Africanus,
inuaded Spaine in reuenge
of his father, and his

vncle, as a prouince vntoucht
in a manner, &amp; new
to vs as till then. Hee presently
tooke Carthage in
Spaine, and other cities, nor
contented to haue driuen
the Penish-men out, layd
tribute vpon it also, and
subdued all on this side the
riuer Iberus, and beyond;
himselfe the first of Roman
leaders who ranne vp victoriously,
as far as Gades, &amp;
the shores of the Ocean.
Ther is more in it, to keepe
a prouince, then to make
one. Captaines therefore
were sent with forces hither,
and thither, part after
part, to compell the siercest
people of Spaine, and
the nations thereof, free

till that time, and for that
cause impatient of bearing
any yoake, though not
without much labour, and
bloudshed, to obey vs.
That Cato who was termed
Censorius, brake the hearts
of the Celtiberians, the
stoutest men of Spaine, by
certaine encounters. That
Gracchus, who was father
of the Gracchi, punisht
them with the subuersion
of one hundred, and fiftie
of their cities. That Metellus
who was stiled Macedonicus,
deserued to bee
also called Celtibericus, hauing
gotten Contrebia, by
a memorable exploit, and
gaind more glorie by forbearing
Vertobrigae. Lu-cullus

subdued the Turdulans,
and Vaccaeans, ouerwhome
that later Scipio
Aemilianus, obtained pompous
spoils in a single combat,
in which the king was
challenger. Decimus Brutus
went somwhat farther,
ouercomming the Gallicians,
and al the Gallician nations,
beyond the riuer Obliuion,
which the souldiers
quaked to behold, and
marching along the Ocean
shore as conquerour, hee
turnd not his ensignes another
way, till hee saw the
Sunne stoop vnder the sea,
and his fires ouer whelmed
as it were with waters, not
without some scruple in
Brutus, who was chill'd at

the sight, lest perhaps it
had beene in him a kind of
sacrilege. But the hardest
hold of all was with the Lusitanians,
and Numantines,
nor that without cause, for
only they in all those countreys
were fitted with captaines.
And we had found
no lesse worke with the
Celtiberians, had not Solundicus,
chiefe author of that
commotion, beene destroid
in the beginning, a most
dangerous, and desperate
man had he prosperd, who
twirling a certaine speare of
siluer, which was pretended
by him to be sent from heauen,
counterfeited the prophet,
and drew all to admire,
and follow him. But

the same rashnesse which
had put him on, making him
also aduenture after twylight
towards the Consuls
campe, a souldier chopt his
iaueline into him, close at
the pauilion it selfe. But
Viriathus made the Lusitanians
plucke vp their courages,
a mā of a most sharp,
and cunning wit, from
huntsman turning highway
thiefe, and from highway
thiefe turning prince,
and captaine generall, and,
had fortune said the word,
the Romulus of Spaine. For
not contented to maintain
the freedome of his nation,
hee destroyed all the
countreys on either side
the riuers of Iberus, and

                     Tagus, with fire, and sword,
fourteene yeeres together,
and, assailing the camps of
Praetors, &amp; Presidents, had
the slaughter of Claudius
Vnimanus, or One-hand,
and of his whole armie to
almost the last man, and in
his mountaines erected
tropheas of such ensignes,
robes, and maces of state as
hee had wonne away of
ours. At the last hee was
brought into extremities
by Fabius Maximus, Consul.
But his successor Seruilius
Cepio staind the victorie.
For greedie to bee
ridde of the trouble once
for all, he entred into practice
with some trecherous
cōpanions, familiar friends

of Viriathus, and got him
murthred, being alreadie
brought low, and ready to
yeeld vpon any termes, and
thereby gaue the enemie
so much honor, as to make
it thought that hee could
not otherwise bee conquerd.
               
               
                  CHAP. XVIII.
                  The Numantine warre.
                  
                     AS Numantia was
inferiour to Carthage,
                     A. V. C. DCXII.
                     Capua, and
Corinth for riches, so for
vertue and honour, it was
equall to them altogether,
and if wee respect the men
thereof, it was simply the

greatest glorie of Spaine,
for hauing neither wall,
nor bulwarke, and beeing
but onely situated vpon a
little rising knoll, or hill by
the riuer Durius; with no
more then foure thousand,
it endured fourteene yeers
siege against an armie of
fortie thousand: And not
endured onely, but gaue
also terrible ouerthrowes,
and forced vs to accept of
shamefull conditions. And
remayning vnconquer'd
after all was done that
could bee, no other person
would serue the turne to
subuert it, but he who subdued
Carthage. To speake
ingenuously, there was no
warre of ours, the cause

whereof was more vniust
then was this. For the Segidensers,
their friends, and
kinsfolke, escaping our
hands, were entertained
by them. No intercession
vsed on their behalfe
would be heard. And albeit
they abstained from
intermedling in any broils
of warre, they were notwithstanding
commanded,
if they would haue a
firme, and formall peace,
to purchase it by parting
with their armes. This
proposition was so interpreted
by the barbarous,
as if they must goe hide away
their heads in holes.
Hereupon they forth with
fell to armes, Megaera a

most braue souldier, their
captaine generall; and
charging Pompei home in
fight, they did choose to
enter league, when they
could haue made an end
of him. After this they set
vpon Mancinus, whom
they so amated with daily
slaughters, that he had not
a souldier in his army
durst looke a Numantine in
the face, or stand his voice,
yet such was their noblenesse,
that they were content
to make a peace with
him also, when they might
haue had the killing of all
his army to a man. But
the people of Rome no
lesse ashamed, nor storming
lesse at the reproach

of these conclusions of
peace with the Numantines,
then they did for
those at Caudium, discharged
themselues from the
dishonour of that base
treatie, by yeelding vp
Mancinus to the enemie.
But Generall Scipio, one
throughly season'd for the
ouerthrow of cities by the
burning of Carthage, grew
hot at length vpon reuenge.
But hee had more
worke within his owne
campe, then in the open
field; with his owne men,
then with the Numantians.
For his armie hauing vnder
other captaines beene
formerly tired with dayly,
and iniust, but specially

seruile labours, such of
them as knew not how to
vse their weapons, were
commaunded, for their
ease who knew the vse, to
carry more stakes, and
earth to the rampire, and
that those should be rayed
with durt, who would not
be smeared with bloud. Besides
that, strumpets, scullions,
and all things else
which were not of necessitie
to be vsed, were cut away.
It is a saying, that
Such as the captaine is, such
is the souldier. The armie,
thus reduced vnder
discipline, encounters the
enemie, and then came
that to passe which no
man did euer hope for; the

                     Numantians, in sight of all
men, ranne away. They
would likewise haue yeelded
themselues, if the conditions
would haue beene
but tolerable for men to
accept. But nothing contenting
Scipio, sauing a
real, and absolute victorie,
they in such extremities
resolue to make a desperate
sallie, after they first
had feasted well, as at their
last viands, with halfe-raw
flesh, and a kinde of broth,
or drinke made of corne,
and called by the inhabitants
keale, or Caelia. This
resolution of theirs discouer'd
to Scipio, hee would
not afford, to men so minded,
the fauour of battell,

but girts them vp close
with foure camps, and
hemming them round
within trench, and counterscarph,
they besought
him for fight, that so hee
might dispatch them like
men. But when that
would not bee granted,
they agree to rush out
howsoeuer, and comming
so to handy-strokes, very
many of them were slaine;
and famine now comming
fast vpon the residue, they
liued yet a little longer.
Their last helpe was to
flie, but their wiues brake
their horse-bridles, and
committing an heinous
offence through loue, bereft
them of that remedy.

Their end therefore being
now no longer to bee
deferred, their sufferance
turnes into furie, decreeing
among themselues to
die in this manner: They
made away their captains,
themselues, and towne
with the sword, with poyson,
and with setting all on
fire. Goe thy wayes, O
thou most valiant citie of
the world, and in mine opinion
most happy withall,
in the very worst that
happened vpon thee, being
that, for protection of
thy friends thou didst defend
thy selfe with thine
owne hand, and for so
long a time, against that
people which had all the

earth to backe, and beare
them out. To conclude,
the citie which was thus taken
by the greatest captaine
vnder heauen, lest nothing
of it selfe for the enemie
to reioyce in ouer it.
For, there was not a man
of all Numantia left aliue
to bee trail'd in chaines;
spoile, and bootie, as among
poore folkes, there
was not any; their armor,
&amp; munition were burnt.
So all the triumph which
could bee had, was ouer a
name alone.

                  A briefe repetition.
                  
                     ALl this while the
people of Rome
were in their actions
faire,A. V. C. DLXIV. noble, pious, holy,
and magnificent. The ages
following as they were as
full of great acts, so were
they also more troublesome,
and foule vices still
growing as the empire
grew. So that if a man diuide
into two parts this
third age of their power,
emploi'd by them in attempts
out of Italy, he must
worthily confesse, the
first hundred yeeres thereof,
in which they tamed

                     Africke, Macedonia, Sicilia,
and Spaine, to bee, as
the poets sing them, the
golden age, the other hundred
to bee plainely the
yron, and bloudy one, and
whatsoeuer else is more
horribly cruell: as that,
which with the Iugurthine,
Cimbrian, Mithridatick,
Parthian, Gallick and German
warres, whose acts
made our glorie mount to
heauen it selfe, did mingle
those Gracchian, and Drusine
massacres, yea the
bondmens warre, and (that
no dishonour might hee
wanting) the warre against
the fensers also. And finally
turning their weapons
each vpon the other,

they tore themselues into
pieces, with the hands of
Marius, and Sylla, and
lastly of Pompei, and Caesar,
as it were in fits of rage,
and furie, and in contempt
of all religion. Which
actions, though they are
intricately wrapt one
within the other, and confounded
among themselues,
neuerthelesse to
make them the better to
appeare, and that their heinous
facts may not trouble
their heroick, they shal
be set forth apart. Therefore,
to follow our first method,
wee will commemorate
those iust, and solemne
warres against forein nations,
that the degrees of

greatnesse by which the
empire was day by day
augmented, may bee manifest.
Then will wee returne
to those blacke deeds
of theirs, in their monstrous
foule, and execrable
ciuill battels.

                  The warre in Asia with
ARISTONICVS.
                  
                     
                        SPain being conquerd
in the west part of
the world,A. V. C. DCXX. the people
of Rome enioyed peace
in the East, nor peace only,
but a kinde of vnusuall, and
vnknowne faelicity, the estate
of kings, and the riches

of whole realmes
comming to them as bequests,
and legacies. Attalus,
king of Pergamus,
son of king Eumenes, once
our associate, and fellow-souldier,
made his last will
thus, I make the people of
Rome the heire of all my
goods. And it was a part of
his goods that he did so.
The people therefore of
Rome entring vpon the
whole estate, retain'd it not
by fight, &amp; force, but (which
is more iust) by vertue of
his deuice, and testament.
It is hard to say, whether
they lost this legacie, or recouer'd
it sooner. Aristonicus,
a yong fierce prince, &amp;
of the bloud roiall, did

easily worke the cities, accustomed
to bee gouern'd
by kings, to acknowledge
him for soueraigne lord, &amp;
those other which resisted
him, as Mindus, Samos, Colophon,
hee seis'd by force.
He had the slaghter also of
the army of Crassus, Proconsul,
&amp; tooke him prisoner.
But Crassus remēbring
the honor of his house, and
of the Roman name, strook
out the eye of his half-barbarous
keeper with the
yerk of a wand, to procure
his owne killing thereby.
And as he wisht, so it hapned.
Perperna, soone after
this, ouerthrew, and tooke
Aristonicus in battell, who
yeelding himselfe, was kept

in chaines. Marcus Aquilius
made an end of the remaines
of the Asian warre,
by poys'ning (O base!) the
well-heads of certaine cities,
to compell them therby
to yeeld. Which fact as
it ripened the victorie, so it
made the same infamous.
For, against the will of the
Gods, and the custome of
ancestors, it blemished the
luster of the Roman armes,
(preserued till then religiously
pure) with impure
drugges, and sorceries.

                     THese things past
in the Orient.
But there was
not the like quiet
in the South. Who would

looke for any war in Africa,
after Carthage was subdued?
But the kingdome
of Numidia gaue to it selfe
a great blow, and though
Anibal was rid out of the
way, yet Iugurtha had that
in him which was to be feared:
for he, the most false &amp;
crafty prince vnder heauen,
ventured vpon the people
of Rome, glorious, for great
acts, and not to be conquered
by the sword: and yet
things fell out beyond all
mens imaginations, that he
the king, who surpast all others
in cunning, should
himselfe bee surprised by
cunning. This prince, grād-child
to Masinissa, and by adoption
the son of Micipsa,
                     
moued to it by ambition of
soueraignty, hauing resolued
to murther his brothers,
and yet not fearing
them so much as the Senate,
and people of Rome,
vnder whose protection,
and wardship they were,
wrought his first black feate
by practice, and vpon that
plot geting Hiempsals head,
as hee was contriuing how
to kill Adherbal also, and
hee flying to Rome for refuge,
Iugurtha by soundly
monying his Ambassadors,
to bribe others with, drew
euen the Senate also to take
his part. And this was the
first victory which he gaind
of vs. Afterwards, when
Scaurus was appointed by

the state to make partition
of the kingdome betweene
himselfe, and Adherbal, he
conquerd the noble qualities
of the Roman common-weale
by corrupting
him, and effected thereby
his vndertaken wickednesse
the more boldly. But hainous
acts neuer lye hidden
long. The bribing of Scaurus
came to light, and a decree
was made to reuenge
the parricidiall murther by
warre. Calpurnius Bestia,
Consull, was the first emploid
into Numidia. But
the king, experimentally
knowing, that gold could
doe more against the Romans
then Iron, bought
his peace. Guilty of the

premisses, hee notwithstanding
both came vpon summons,
and safe-conduct to
Rome, and with like audaciousnesse
suborning the actors,
murthered his competitor
in the kingdome,
Massina grand-child of Masinissa.
This was another
cause for the Romans to take
armes vp against the tyrant.
The reuenge therefore was
committed to bee taken by
Albinus. But (ô the shame!)
Iugurtha so ouerbribed his
armie also, that our men
voluntarily giuing way, he
got the victory, and our
camp withall; and reckning
it in as a part of the price,
that hee suffered the armie
which he had bought, to

escape his hands, did put
vpō vs dishonorable terms.
At the same time, Metellus
steppeth out against him,
not so much in reuenge of
the Roman empire, as to redeeme
the blemishes thereof;
and dealing most cunningly,
one while by entreaty,
another while by
threats, and fayning flight
when hee meant nothing
lesse, matcht him at his own
weapons: nor contenting
himselfe with the waste, &amp;
desolation of fields, and
villages, made attempts vpon
the chiefe fortresses of
Numidia, and long time
sought to get Zama, though
in vaine: neuerthelesse hee
sackt Thala, where the kings

munition, and treasures lay.
So hauing stript him out of
his cities, hee pursued him
through Mauritania, and
Getulia, flying his owne
confines, and kingdome.
Last of all, Marius, much
augmenting the armie, as
hauing, according to the
obscuritie of his birth,A. V. C. DCXLII. admitted
the scumme of Rome
to the oath of soldiers, sets
vpon Iugurtha wounded as
he was, &amp; already forced to
flie, and yet ouer-came him
no more easily then as if he
had beene fresh, and vnbroken.
This man most fortunately
mastred Capsa, a citie
dedicated to Hercules, seated
in the middle of Africa,
enuironed with sands, and

serpents, and scaled Mulucha,
built vpon a steepe
mountaine, a certaine Ligurian
leading vp to it vpon
break-necke clifs, and high
ouer-hanging places; and
gaue to king Bocchus, who
for kindreds sake tooke his
part, a terrible ouerthrow at
Cirta. Bocchus thereupon
distrusting his owne estate,
and fearing to be drawn into
another mans ruine, as
accessarie, indented for his
owne peace, and safetie at
the perill of Iugurtha. So
that most false and slipperie
man, by his father in Lawes
practices ensnared, was betraid
into the hands of Sulla.
Thus in the end the
people of Rome had the gazing

vpon him, brought laden
with yrons in triumph:
and he againe though ouerborne,
and fast bound, beheld
that citie, which he like
a lying prophet had sung,
would one day perish, if it
could once meete with a
chapman. Let it notwithstanding
haue beene neuer
so saleable, it had a chapman
in him, and, seeing he
escaped not, sure wee are,
that it shall neuer perish.

                  The Alobrogian warre.
                  
                     IN this wise went
things with the people
of Rome in the
South world.A. V. C. DCXXVIII. The troubles

which brake out North
ward, were farre more manifold,
and horrible: no
quarter is so disquietous,
the skie there alwayes lowring,
and the peoples natures
harsh, and peeuish: the
outragious enemie burst
forth vpon this side, and
vpon that, and from the
midst it selfe of the North.
The Salyans, of all the nations
beyond the Alps, were
the first who felt our wrath,
by reason of a complaint,
which they of Massilia, a
friend-towne, most true, &amp;
firme to vs, had made of
their incursions. The next
were the Allobroges, and
Aruernois, for that the
Aedui implored our helpe,

and assistance, against them,
as vsing the like vexations.
Varus, and Isara which run
through Vindilicia, and the
swiftest of riuers the Rhone,
are witnesses of our victory,
the thing which most
frighted the barbarous, was
the sight of the elephants,
as those which matcht
themselues in boistrousnes.
The brauest obiect in this
triumph was the king himselfe,
Bituitus, presented to
vs in discolourd armes, and
siluer chariot, iust as hee
fought. How great, and
how greatly important the
victory was, in the opinion
of both, may be coniectured
by this, that Domitius
Aenobarbus, and Fabius

Maximus, reared towres
of stone vpon the places of
battell, and fixed tropheas
on their tops, adornd with
the enemies spoyles, which
was not our wont till then.
For the people of Rome neuer
vpbraided the vanquisht
enemie with their
ouerthrow.

                  The Cimbrian, Theutonicke,
and Tigurin
warre.
                  
                     THE Cimbrians,
                     A. V. C. DCXL.
                     Theutons, and Tigurins,
flying from
the vtmost bounds of Gallia,
the Ocean hauing swallowed

their countreyes,
sought newe habitations
where they could finde
them out, through the
world: and being bard all
entrance into Gall, &amp; Spain,
they wheeling about to Italie,
sent their ambassadors
to Silanus, where hee lay
encamped, and from thence
to the Senat, entreating that
martiall common-weale to
allot them out some proportions
of land, in stead
of pay; for which they
should alwayes vse the seruice
of their hands, and
swords, at their good pleasure.
But what land should
the Roman people diuide
among them, who were
ready to goe together by

the eares among themselues,
about lawes touching
the allotting out of
grounds? Their petition
therefore being reiected,
what they could not compasse
by entreaties, they
concluded to winne by
force. Nor could Silanus
hold out against them in
the first brunt of the barbarous,
nor Manilius in
the second, nor Caepio in
the third. They were all
of them defeated, and driuen
out of their tents, and
trenches. They had made
an end of vs, had not Marius
hapned to liue in that
age. Yet euen hee himselfe
not daring presently
to encounter them, held

his souldiers within their
strength, till that inuincible
rage, and furious onset,
which goes current
with the barbarous for
true valour, fell. Thereupon,
they marcht about
back, craking, and vpbrayding
vs, and asking in scorn
(so confident they were of
sacking the citie) what
they would haue home to
their wiues. Nor more
slowly then was menaced,
they rusht thorow the
Alps, that is to say, the very
barres of Italy, in three
maine battels. Marius
makes wondrous speed after,
and out-stripping the
enemy, by shortest cuts
ouertakes the Theutons,
                     
who had the vantguard,
at the very climbe of the
Alps, in a place called Aquae
Sextiae, and quite distrest
them in their ouermuch
security. The enemy
was master of the
valley, and riuer, and our
men had no water to
drinke at all. Whether
Marius tooke that drie
ground of purpose, or
turn'd by wit his errour to
aduantage, is doubtfull to
say, but courage inforced
by necessity, was for certaine,
the cause of victorie.
For his army crying out
for water, Yee are men
(quoth hee) and there it is:
they fought therfore with
such courage, &amp; made such

slaughter of the enemies,
that the Romans hauing
the day, dranke not more
water out of the colour'd
riuer, then they did of the
bloud of the barbarous.
Surely, king Theutobocchus
himselfe, who was wont to
vawt ouer foure, or fiue
horses let together, had
scarce any time to get one
now for himselfe to flie
away vpon, and, being
apprehended in the
next forest, was single an
whole shew himselfe,
being a person of so huge
an height, as hee ouertopt
the tropheas selues.
The Theutons vtterly
thus destroide, hee turnes
vpon the Cimbrians.
                     
(who would beleeue it?)
clambring ouer at the crags
of Tridentum, through the
snow, which makes it winter
all wayes on the Alps,
and raiseth them higher
then naturally their ridges
are, came rolling down vpon
Italy in plumps. They
attempted to passe the riuer
Athesis, not by bridge,
or boat, but according to
their lubberly wits, assaid
to stop it first with their bodies:
but when they saw
they could not stay the
streame with their hands,
and targets, they plasht
downe trees, and so crost
ouer: and had they immediately
set on towards the
citie, the perill had beene

extremely great. But in the
Venetian grounds, whose
mould is in a manner the
finest of all Italie, the daintinesse
of the ayre, and soile
entendred their spirits; and
being otherwise well softned
with the vse of bread,
sodden flesh, and sweete
wines, Marius in very good
season sets vpon them: they
praid him to assigne them
a day of battell, which hee
named to be the next of all.
They ioyned in a most
spacious champaine called
Caudium, and there one
hundred, and fortie thousand
of them left their
liues: so they were fewer
now in the whole first number,
by another third. They

had the execution of the
barbarous for an whole
dayes space. These also
taught our captaine generall
to piece out manhood
with martiall cunning, imitating
Anibal, and his artes
at Cannae: for hauing to beginne
with, a mistie day, &amp;
by that an aduantage to
charge them at vnaware, &amp;
the same a windie one also,
which might serue to carry
the dust into their eyes, and
faces, Marius, making vse
of all, ranged his battell
towards the rising Sunne,
so that the brightnesse, and
repercussion of the beames
vpon our helmets, made
the heauens seem as if they
were on fire, as was by and

by, afterwards vnderstood
by the captiues, nor was it
a lesse worke to ouercome
their wiues, then themselues.
For hauing made
a barricado about them
with carts, and waggons,
they strooke at vs from
aloft, as it were from towrtoppes,
with slaues, and
lances. Their death was
as gallant as their fight.
For when the ambassage
which they dispatched to
Marius, could not obtaine
liberty at his hands, and
priesthood (nor was it lawfull)
they euery-where
strangled their infants, or
pasht out their braines, and
either, one of them kill'd
the other, or making

halters of their tresses
of haire trust themselues
vp by the necks, vpon
boughs, or the rails of their
carts. King Beleus fighting
couragiously was beaten
downe dead, and not against
his will. The other
battell consisting of the Tigurins,
which had taken
vp the smaller hils of the
Norick Alps, as it were for
a back, or succour to their
fellowes, betaking themselues
to base flight, and
trading in robberies, slipt
away whither they could,
and vanished. These so
glad, and glorious newes,
concerning the libertie of
Italy, and the deliuerance
of the empire, came first to

the peoples eares not by
men, as the manner is, but
(if it be not against religion
to beleeue it) by the Gods
themselues. For the same
day, vpon which the thing
was done, young men
crown'd with laurel, were
seene before the temple of
Castor, and Pollux, reaching
letters to the Praetor,
and a common rumour
without a knowne author,
luckily ran in the theater,
The Cimbrians are ouercome.
Then which thing
what could be more admirable,
or glorious? for Rome,
as if lifting her selfe on tiptoe,
vpon her owne hils, she
had beene present at the
sight of the battell, the

people, as is vsuall in a shew
of sword-players, clap
their hands in applause, at
the self-same instant in
which the Cimbrians were
ouerthrowne in battell.

                  The Thracian
warre.
                  
                     AFter the Macedonians,
the Thracians
(if the Gods will)
rebelled, who themselues
were tributaries to the
Macedonians: nor content
to make inroads into
the next prouinces, they
did the like in Thessaly, &amp;
Dalmatia, running out as

farre as to the Adrian sea,
and stopping there as at
natures entreatie, they
threw their darts into the
waues themselues, Meanewhile,
there was no kinde
of cruelty left vnpractised
vpon the captiues, during
all that time. They sacrifice
mans bloud to the
Gods, quaffing it out of
their enemies sculls, by
this kinde of mockage defiling
death aswell with fire,
as fume, and teare infants
quick out of their mothers
wombs with torments.
The Sordiscans were of all
the Thracians the most sauage,
&amp; had as much craft
as wildenesse of courage.
The situation of their

woods, &amp; mountaines conspired
with their shrew'd,
&amp; wily wits. All the army
therefore which Cato led,
was not only put to rowt,
or flight by them, but
(which is like a wonder)
was wholly entrapt, and
way-laid. Didius beats thē
back into their own Thrace
as they straggled, &amp; dispersed
themselues here and
there on boot-haling. Drusus
draue them farther off,
and forbad them to passe
Danubius. Minucius destroyd
them all about Aebrus,
not without losse, I
confesse, of many of his
owne, while they ride vpon
the false crusts of yce
breaking vnder. Piso scowred

                     Rhodope, and Caucasus.
Curio pierced as farre as
Dracia: but the gloominesse
of the woods coold
his courage. Appius ranne
vp as farre as to Sarmatia.
Lucullus to Tanais, the
bounder of those nations,
and to the lake Maeotis. Nor
were these most mercilesse
enemies otherwise tamed,
then by vsing their owne
measure towards them: no
pitie was taken of their prisoners,
but all of them rid
out of the world with fire,
and sword. But nothing so
terrifide the barbarous,
as the chopping off their
hāds, by which they seemd
to ouerliue their owne punishment.

                  The war with Mithridates.
                  
                     THe Pontick nations
are planted
towards the
North vpon the sea on the
left hand of vs,A. V. C. DCLIX. and are so
called of the Pontick sea.
The first king of all these
nations, and countreys
was Atheas, afterwards
Artabazes, who descended
of the seuen Persians.
Mithridates comming of
him, was the mightiest of
them all. For whereas foure
yeeres serued against Pyrrhus,
&amp; seuenteene yeeres
against Anibal, he resisted
fortie yeeres, till finally

subdued in three huge
warres, the felicity of Sulla,
the vertue of Lucullus, and
the mightinesse of Pompei,
brought him to nothing.
Hee pretended for the
cause of his hostility, before
lieutenant Cassius,
Nicomedes of Bithynia,
whom hee charged with
inuading his confines.
But the truth is, that
blowne-out with ambition,
hee coueted the monarchie
of all Asia, and, if
hee could, of Europe also.
Our vices gaue him
hope, and confidence
vnto it. For being diuided
among our selues
with ciuill warres, the verie
opportunitie allured

him and Marius, Sulla, and
Sertorius laid that remote
side of the empire open.
In these wounds of the
commonweale, and amidst
these tumults, this sudden
whirlewinde of the Pontick
warre, as if taking aduantage
of the times, blew
from off as it were the farmost
watch-towre of the
Northerne world at vnawares
vpon vs, being both
wearie then, and diuersely
distracted. The first
blast of this warre swept
away Bithynia from vs in
a trice. Then the like
terrour fell vpon the rest
of Asia. Nor were the
cities, and nations thereof
slow in reuolting to

the king. And hee was at
hand, and prest them hard,
vsing crueltie as a vertue.
For what was more deadly
dire, then that one edict
of his, by which hee commaunded
all men thorow
Asia, who were free of
Rome, to be massacred? At
that time certainely, houses,
temples, altars, and all
sorts of lawes, aswell diuine,
as humane, were violated.
But this terrour
vpon Asia, vnlockt Europe
also to the king.
By Archelaus therefore,
and Neoptolemus, hee
disseised vs there of all,
excepting Rhodes onely
(which held for vs more
firmely then the rest) of

                     the Iles of the Cyclades,
Delos, and Eubaea, yea
and Athens also, the
glorie it selfe of Greece.
The terrour of the kings
name breathed now vpon
Italy it selfe, and
vpon the verie citie of
Rome. Lucius Sulla therefore,
an excellent good
man, while hee was in action
of armes, and of no
lesse violence, shoued
the enemie backe as it
were with one of his
hands, from encroaching
anie farther. And first
hee brought Athens to
such extremities by siege,
that hee made that citie
(what man would credit
it?) which was the

mother of corne, to eate
mans flesh for hunger, and
vndermining their port Piraeus,
and more then sixe
walls of theirs, after he had
tamed them, yet, though
himselfe called them the
most ingratefull men, hee
neuerthelesse restored to
them their temples, and reputation,
for the honor, and
reuerence of deceased ancestors:
and when Eubaea, &amp;
Baeotia had now chased the
garrisons away which the
King had billetted vpon
them, hee discomfited all
the royall forces together,
in one set battell at Cheronaea,
and in another at Orchomenus:
and from thence
crossing forthwith into Asia,
                     
distrest Mithridates himselfe:
and there also had
beene an end of the quarell,
if his desire had not rather
bin to haue triumpht speedily
ouer the enemie then
cōpletely: this was the state
in which Sulla left Asia. The
league with the Pontickes
recouerd Bithynia of Nicomedes,
and Cappadocia of
Ariobarzanes; as if Asia
had againe beene ours, as at
the beginning: but Mithridates
was but repulsed only.
This course therefore
daunted not the Ponticks,
but set them more on fire.
For the king hauing had Asia,
and as it were tasted the
bait of Europe, sought to
recouer it now by the law

of armes, not as belonging
to others, but, because hee
had once lost it, as his own.
These fires therefore, as
not sufficiently quencht,
brake out into a greater
flame then before; wherevpon
the king repairing his
armies, augmented with
greater numbers thē earst;
and to bee briefe, with the
whole powers of his realm,
he inuaded Asia againe by
sea, and land, and riuers.
Cyzicum a citie ennobled
with a castle, walls, port, &amp;
towers of marble, beautifies
the shores of Asia. Against
this place, as if it
were another Rome, hee
bent his vtmost abilities:
but the citie was encouraged

to withstand vpon the
newes of Lucullus his approach,
who (a wondrrous
thing to bee spoken) floting
on a blowne bladder,
and steering himself with
his feete, seeming, to such
as lookt-on a farre off, like
some swimming whale, escaped
thorow the middle
of the enemies fleete: and
calamitie foorthwith turning
it-selfe to the other
side, the king tyred with
protraction of the siege, &amp;
famine bringing plague,
Lucullus ouertooke him in
his retreat, and made such
worke among his men, that
the riuers Granicus and Aesopus
ranne bloud; the craftie
king knowing the Romans
                     
couetousnesse, will'd
his people to scatter fardles
and money as they fled, to
slacken the pursuers speed:
neither was his flight more
fortunate by sea, then it
was by land; for his nauie
which consisted of one
hundred saile, deepe laden
with munition, ouertaken
with a tempest in the sea of
Pontus, suffered such foule
spoile, as answered the mischiefe
of a battel at sea: no
otherwise then as if Lucullus,
beeing as it were in
league with the winds, and
waues, might seeme to
haue giuen order to the
weather, for beating down
Mithridates. Though all
the strengths of that most

powerfull kingdome were
in this wise ground to pieces,
yet losses made his spirit
greater. Betaking himselfe
therefore to his next
neighbor nations, he drew
the whole East almost, and
North of the world to accompanie
his ruine. Iberians,
Caspians, Albans, and
eitherr of the Armenia's
were solicited to take part,
&amp; Pompet's fortune sought
euery where about for dignitie,
name, and titles with
which to glorifie him, who
beholding Asia on fire
with new combustions, and
that more kings sprung still
out of other, iudging it no
wisedome to delay time,
while in the meane space

the powers of enemy-countreys
might vnite themselues,
he forthwith makes
a bridge of boates, and, of
all men before his dayes,
was the first of ours who
passed ouer Euphrates, and
lighting vpon the flying
king in the middle of Armenia,
made a dispatch of
the warre (how great was
the happines of the man!)
in one onely battel: this
was fought by night, and
the moone was also for vs:
for shining at the backe of
the enemie, as if shee were
in pay on our side, and in
the faces of the Romans, the
Pontickes mistaking their
owne shadowes, proiected
long, as at her going down,

laid at them as at the verie
bodies of their enemies.
So Mithridates was that
night vtterly vanquished.
For from that time forward
hee was able to doe
nothing, though trying all
the wayes possible, after
the maner of snakes, whose
head being bruised, they
threaten last of all with
the taile. For after his escape,
his meaning was to
terrifie Colchos, the sea-coasts
of Cilicia, and our
Campania, with his sudden
comming: then, ouerturning
the port Pyraeus, to
ioyne the countreyes together
as farre as betweene
Colchis, and Bosphorus, from
thence to march through

                     Thracia, Macedonia, and
Greece, and so to assaile Italy
vpon the sudden. These
were his projects, and they
went no farther. For his
subiects reuolting from
him, and himselfe preuented
by the treason of his
sonne Pharnaces, hauing
labourd in vaine to effect it
by poison, he kild himselfe
with his sword. Meanewhile
Cnaeus the Grreat,
pursuing the remainders of
the rebellion of Asia, flew
vp, and downe at pleasure
through diuers countreys,
and nations. For following
the Armenians towards
the east, and taking Artaxata
their principall citie, he
granted back the kingdom

to Tigranes, vpon his submission.
But in marching
north, towards Scythia, he
guided his course by starrs▪
as if he had bin at sea; puts
the Colchians to the sword;
takes the Iberians to mercie,
spares the Albanes, and
encamping vnder mount
Caucasus ir-selfe, commanded
Orodes, the Cholchian
king, to descend from
thence into the plaine; Artoces,
prince of the Iberians
to giue in his children for
hostages: of his own meere
motion he rewards Orodes,
sending vnto him out of
his Albania, a couch of
gold, and other gifts; then
turning his forces Southward,
&amp; marching through

                     Libanus in Syria, and Damascus,
he displaid the Roman
ensignes round about,
passing through those odoriferous
woods, and groues
of balme and frankincense.
The Arabians were at his
seruice. The Iewes assaid to
defend Hierusalem: But he
forced that citie also, and
saw openly that grand mysterie,
as vnder a skie of
beaten gold; the brethren
at ods about the kingdom,
and hee made vmpire, adiudged
the crowne to Hircanus;
claps Aristobulus
into yrons for refusing to
obey the award. Thus the
people of Rome by Pompei
their captain generall ouerrunning
al Asia in the greatest

breadth thereof, made
that which was the vtmost
prouince of the empire to
bee now the middlemost:
for excepting the Parthians
(who did rather choose
our friendship) and the Indians
(who knew vs not
as yet) all Asia betwene the
red sea, the Caspian gulph,
and the Ocean, was possest
by vs, as either tamed, or
distressed by the Pompeian
legions.
               
               
                  CHAP. VI.
                  The warre with the
Pyrates.
                  
                     WHile the Romane
people was held
bufied in diuers

parts of the world, the Cilicians
inuade the seas, destroy
commerce, breake the
bonds of humane societie,
and hinder all nauigation
like a tempest. The troubles
raised in Asia by the
warres of Mithridates, begate
boldnesse in these desperate,
and raging theeues,
while vnder the tumults of
a forraine warre, and at the
enuie of a stranger king,
they roued without punishment;
and contenting
themselues in the beginning
with the neighbouring
seas, vnder Isidorus captain,
they practised their robberies
betwene Crete, and Cyrenae,
Pyraeus, and Achaia,
and cape Maleum, which

they entituled Cape gold,
by reason of braue booties.
Publius Seruilius was employd
out against them,
and though he bulged their
light, and nimble friggats,
with his heauy, and well-appointed
ships of warre,
yet the victory hee got
cost bloud: nor satisfyed
with driuing them from
of the water, hee subuerted
their strongest cities, which
abounded with daily-gotten
pillage, as Phaselis, Olympus,
and Isaurus, the
principall fortresse it selfe
off all Cilicia, and, vpon
the conscience of his great
enterprise, loued the surname
Isauricus. Neuerthelesse,
they could not be

kept on shore, though broken
at sea with so many calamities;
but as certaine
creatures who haue a double
gift to liue in either clement,
the Romans were
no sooner departed from
thence, but impatient of
land-life, they lanch againe
into their water, and
somewhat farther out then
formerly. So Pompey, fortunate
before that time,
seemed now also worthy
to haue the glory of this
seruice, as an accession to
his imployments against
Mithridates. This pestilent
plague dispiersed ouer the
whole sea, he resoluing to
extinguish at once, and for
euer, carryed his attempt

with a kinde of diuine preparation.
For hauing abundance
of ships aswell
of the Romans, as of our
friends, the Rhodians, hee
guarded both the sides
of Pontus, and the coasts
of the Ocean, with many
vice-admirals, &amp; commanders.
Gellius was set to waft
vpon the Tuscan sea; Plotius
vpon the Sicilian; Gratillius
vpon the Ligustine
bay; Marcus Pomponius vpon
the Gallicke; Torquatus
vpon the Balearian; Tiberius
Nero vpon the Gaditanian,
where our seas beginne;
Lentulus vpon the
Libyc; Marcellinus vpon
the Aegyptian; Pompeys
young Sonne vpon the

                     Adriatick; Marcus Portius
vpon the very iawes of Propontis;
who so shrowded
his fleete, that hee watcht
at that passage, as if it had
beene at a gate. So all the
pyrates wheresoeuer, thus
enuironed, within as it were
an hunting toyle, at all
harbours, bayes, shelters,
creekes, promontories,
straights, halfe-iles, were
vtterly distressed. Pompey
vndertooke Cilicia,
the mother, and fountaine
of this warre. And the enemies
were forward to
fight, not for any hope
they had, but because that
being ouerborne, they
would seeme to dare: but
yet no farther, then as only

to brooke the first shocke.
For when they beheld the
beake-heads of our clashing
gallies charge in ring
vpon them, they forthwith
strooke saile, threw away
oares, made a generall
showt (a signe among them
of yeelding) and begged
life. A victory gaind with
lesse bloudshed then this,
as we at no time had, so neither
did wee euer finde a
people more loyall to vs
then they. And that was
long of our Generals high
wisedome, who transplanted
this broode of mariners
far of, out of the very ken
of the sea, and as it were
teddred them fast in the vplands.
Thus at the same

time he recouerd the seas,
for the vse of merchants, &amp;
restored to land her owne
men. In this victory what
should we first admire? whether
celerity, because it was
gotten is forty dayes? or
good fortune, for that hee
lost not a vessell? or finally
the lastingnesse, for that
there neuer was any pyrate
after?

truth, our selues
made to our selues, onely
vpon a desire to conquer

that noble iland. It seemd
to haue fauord Mithridates,
for which seemings sake we
meant to take reuenge by
the sword. Marcus Antonius
was the first who inuaded
it, borne-vp with so
wonderfull an hope, and
affiance of victory, that
hee fraught his ships with
more fetters, then weapons.
Therefore hee had
the reward of his dotage.
for the Cretensians intercepted
most part of his nauie,
and hoising the bodies
of such as they tooke prisoners,
vp in sailes and tacklings,
rowed backe into
their Ports, as it were with
a forewinde in triumph.
Then Metellus wasting the

whole Iland with fire, and
sword, pent them within
their castles, and cities,
Gnosus, Erythraea, and (as
the Greeks are wont to
speake) the mother of cities
Cydona: and hee so
mercilessely plagued the
captiues, that most of
the ilanders poysoned
themselues, other sent
their surrenders to Pompey
absent: who busied in
the enterprises of Asia,
and sending Octauius to
Crete, as gouernour, was
laughed to scorne, for
meddling in another mans
prouince, and prouoked
Metellus to exercise the
right of a conquerour the
more bitterly vpon the

                     Cretans, and hauing vanquisht

Creticus, another of
them was eft-soones stiled
Balearicus. The Baleares
                     
had about the same time
made the seas dangerous
with their pyracies. A
man would wonder that
those wilde, and sauage
people durst once so much
as looke from their rocketoppes
downe vpon the
sea: But, more then so,
they ventur'd foorth to sea
in bungled boates, and
now, and then frighted
such as saild by, with suddaine
on-sets, and now also
when they a farre off
descry'd the Roman nauie
approach in the maine sea,
conceiuing it to bee purchase,
they had the hearts
to assaile it, and at the first
charge couerd it with an
huge showre of small and

great stone. Each of them
vseth three slings in battell.
Who will wonder if
they bee excellent markemen,
when these are the
onely armes the nation
hath, and are bred vp in
the practice of them from
their child-hoode? A boy
gets no morsell at his mothers
hands, but that of
which shee makes a white,
and which himselfe must
hit. But this kind of haile
did not long terrifie the
Romans. After they came
to hand-strookes, and felt
our beake-heads, and iauelines
comming, they
raised a bellowing crie, like
so many beasts, and fled
to shore, where slipping in

among the next hillockes,
the first worke was to find
them out, the next, to conquer
them.

in charge to Publius Claudius,
a tribune of theirs,
author of the motion, to
confiscate that prince,
though aliue, and in league

whereof hee shortned his

riches of Cyprus were conueighed
in barges vp the

fortune transfer'd
vpon Caesar the conquest
of that which was
left vntoucht in Europe.
And there remained the
most terrible of all other
nations, the Galls, and Germans:
and Britaine though
diuided from the whole
world, yet had notwithstanding
one to conquer
it. The first cause of
this trouble begun at the
Heluetians, who seated
betweene the Rhene, and
Rhodanus, and their countreys

                     prouing to narrow
for their swarmes, came to
demand of vs other habitations,
hauing first set
their townes on fire. A
solemne signe among them
of neuer returning thither.
But we asking time for deliberation,
and during that
delay, when Caesar, by cutting
downe the bridge ouer
Rhone, had taken from
them the meanes of flying
away, hee by and by led
backe that most warlike
people into their olde
homes, as a shepheard
driues his flocks to their
sheep-folds. The following
battell which was
fought against the Belgiās,
was much more bloudy, as

against men who fought
for freedome. Here the Romans
did many famous
feats of armes, and this of
Caesar's was most singular,
that his army inclining to
flie, hee snatcht the target
from one who was running
away, and charging
vpon the face of the enemies,
restored the battell
with his owne hand. After
this hee encountred the
Veneti at sea, but the combat
was greater with the
Ocean then with the enemies
shippes. For they
were bungerly made, and
mis-shapen, and had presently
beene split with
our beake-heads, but the
shallow places hindred

the fight, that the tide
withdrawing vpon course,
during the skirmish, the
Ocean might as it were
seeme to haue beene stickler
in the battell. He had
elsewhere also to deale with
difficulties which grew
from the nature of the nations,
and places. The
Aquitans, a subtill generation,
betooke themselues
to grots, and holes vnder
ground: Caesar had damd
them vp. The Morini
slipt aside into the woods:
hee commanded to fire
them. Let no man say the
Galls are onely fierce, they
vse fraud also. Induciomarus
assembled the Treuirists,
Ambiorix the Eburones,
                     
and making a combination
among themselues in
Caesars absence, both of
them found out his seueral
lieutenants generall. But
Titus Labienus stoutly repulsed
the one of them, &amp;
brought that kings head
away. The other laying
an ambuscado in the vally,
ouercame vs by craft, and
so the campe was sackt,
and the gold thereof taken.
There wee lost Cotta, with
Titurius Sabinus lieutenāt
generall. Nor could wee
euer bee-meet with that
king after, for hee plaide
least in sight beyond the
Rhene perpetually. But
Rhene, for all that, escaped
vs not, as neither was it fit,

that it should be a free receiuer,
and defender of
our enemies. But Caesar's
ground of warre against
the Germans was at first
most iust. For the Sequani
complain'd of their incursions.
How great was then
the pride of Ariouistus?
when our ambassadours
said, Come thou to Caesar?
What is that Caesar? quoth
the king? And let him come
to mee if hee will, and what
concernes it him what our
Germanie doth? am I a
meddler in the Roman affaires?
The terrour therfore
of this new nation
was so great throughout
the campe, that they who
were of the maine battell,

made euery-where their
last wills, and testaments.
But those giant like bodies,
by how much the huger
they were, by so much
were they the fairer marke
for a sword, or dart to hit.
What the feruour of our
souldiers was in the fight,
cannot bee set forth in any
example more clearely
then in this, that when the
barbarous whelm'd their
shields ouer their heads,
couering themselues as vnder
a roofe, or pent-house,
or as a tortoys vnder the
shell, the Romans sprung vp
vpon the shields, and
from thence did cut their
throats. Againe, when the
Menapians complaind to

vs of the Germans, Caesar
passeth ouer the Mose, vpon
a bridge of boats, seekes
out Rhene it selfe, and the
enemies, among the Hercinian
woods. But all the
whole race of them was
fled into the wildes, and
marshes, the army of the
Romans appearing on a
sudden on this side the
banke of Rhene, strooke
such an amazement among
them. Nor did we crosse
that riuer onely once, but
againe also, and that by a
bridge made ouer it. At
which time their affright
was much augmented,
when they beheld their
Rhene taken prisoner as it
were, and yoaked with a

bridge, betaking themselues
afresh in flight to
their forests, and fennie
places; that which most
fretted Caesar, being that
hee had not whom to conquer.
Thus all made ours
both at land, and sea, hee
casts his eye vpon the Ocean,
and as if the Roman
world sufficed not, his
minde was set how to atchieue
another. For this
cause gathering a nauie, he
made for Britaine. Hee
crost into Britaine with
marueilous speed; for
weighing anchor out of
the harbour of the Morini,
at the third watch, hee
was landed in the Iland
before noone. The shores

there, were full of the enemies
troubled troups, and
the chariots of war whirled
vp and downe disorderly,
their riders quaking at the
wonder of the sight: their
feare therefore was instead
of a victorie. The timorous
Britans yeelded vp their
armes, and gaue hostages:
and Caesar had then marcht
farther, had not the Ocean
giuen his shatterd fleete a
sore scourging with his billowes.
Thereupon he returnd
into Gall, and with a
greater armada, and more
forces then before, did
thrust out once againe into
the same Ocean, and againe
pursuing the same Britans
into the Caledonian woods,

he also caused Cauelianus,
one of their kings, to bee
fast bound in chaines. Contenting
himselfe with this
(for his intention was not
to get prouinces, but glorie)
he makes back into Gall
with more spoiles then at
first, the Oceans selfe more
quiet, and fauourable, as if
it confest it selfe too weake
for Caesar. But the last
mightiest conspiracie of
the Galls, was, when that
prince so dreadfull for stature,
martiall skill, and
courage, and whose very
name seem'd deuised to
strike a terrour, Vercingetorix,
drew at once all the
Aruernois, and Bituriges
the Carnutes, and Sequani
                     
into a league, by speaking
bigge among them, when
the assemblies of people
were thickest, as in their
groues vpon festiuall, and
counsel-dayes, erecting
their mindes thereby for
recouerie at their antient
libertie. Caesar was at this
time absent out of Gallia,
busie in taking fresh musters
of Rauenna, and the
Alps themselues heapt
high with winter snowes,
and so the wayes cloyed
vppe, they presumed hee
was fast, and safe enough.
But of how fortunate a
rashnesse was hee at the
newes? Ouer cragges, and
cliffes of mountaines,
thorow wayes, and drifts

of snow, till that time
pathlesse, hee with lightarmed
bands of souldiers
got into Gall, vnited his
winter-camps there, which
stood farre distant, and was
himselfe in person in the
middle of Gallia, before
the remotest part feared
his comming. Then assaulting
the heart-strengths
of the warre, hee destroy'd
Auaricum, and a garrison
in it of fortie thousand,
and leuel'd Alexia to the
ground with fire, which
had two hundred, and
fiftie thousand fighting
men to rescue it. The
whole stresse of the warre
was about Gergouia. For
that most spacious citie,

hauing foure score thousand
defendents, walls also,
a castell, and craggie
cliffes, was girt-in round
by Caesar with workes,
stakes, and a ditch through
which hee drew the riuer,
and with eighteene
seuerall camps in the
whole compasse, and an
huge counterscarpe, by
which meanes he tamed it
first with famine, and such
of the defendents as durst
sally out, being either
cut in pieces in the trenches
with the sword, or
gored vpon the stakes, hee
at last constrained it to
yeeld. That very king
himselfe, the principall
glorie of Caesars conquest,

both came like an humble
suitor into the campe, and
throwing his caparisons,
and armes at his foote,
said thus vnto him, O
thou most valiant of men,
thou hast conquer'd a valiant
man.

warre.
                  
                     WHile the people
of Rome vtterly
distrest the Galls
towards the North of the
world, they receiue a grieuous
wound in the East,
by the Parthians. For
which wee cannot blame

fortune. The discomfiture
afforded no kinde of comfort.
The greedy humor
of Crassus, Consul, which
had neither Gods, nor men
to friend, gaping for Parthian
gold, cost eleuen legions
their liues, and him
that head of his, vpon
which Metellus, Tribune
of the people, had powred
hostile curses at his setting
out. And when the army
was past Zeugma, sudden
whirle-windes threw our
standards into! Euphrates
where they sunke: &amp; when
he encamped at Nicephorium,
ambassadours, from
king Orodes summon'd
him to remember the
leagues which Parthians
                     
had formerly made with
Pompey, and Sulla; but his
minde wholy bent how to
swallow the treasures of
that realme, without pretending
so much as an
imaginary cause of warre,
only said, he would answer
at Seleucia. The Gods
therfore, who take reuenge
for violating publike
leagues, did both prosper
the stratagems, and strokes
of the enemies. For first,
Euphrates, the onely riuer
to conueigh our victuals,
and defend vs, was now betweene
vs, and home;
then againe, credit was giuen
to a certaine counterfeit
fugitiue, one Mazara, a
Syrian, who trayning the

army out into the midst of
the open desarts of the
country, betrayd it to the
enemy on all sides, Crassus
therefore was scarce approached
to Carrhae, when
Syllax, and Surena, the
kings chiefe captaines, display'd
&amp; florisht their flags
wouen of silke, and gold.
And presently thereupon
the enemies Cauallery gaue
in on euery hand, powring
their shot of arrowes vpon
vs as thicke as the drops of
haile, or raine. So the legions
beaten miserably to
the earth, himselfe allured
out to a parley, had, vpon a
signe giuen by the enemy,
come quick into their
hands, if the resistance of

the Tribunes had not moued
the barbarous to preuent
his escape by killing
him. That notwithstanding,
they chopt off his
head, &amp; made themselues
merrie with it. As for his
sonne, they ouerwhelm'd
him with shot, euen almost
in his fathers sight. The
remaines of that vnfortunate
host shifting each man
for himselfe, &amp; scatter'd by
flight into Armenia, Cilicia,
and Syria, did scarce afford
a man aliue to bring
the newes. The head, and
right hand of Crassus were
brought to king Orodes, &amp;
made sport for him, nor
that vnfitly. For they
powr'd molten gold in at

his open mouth, that hee
who was on fire with the
thirst of gold while hee liued,
his dead, &amp; bloudlesse
carcase might haue enough
thereof to serue his turne.

                  The recapitulation.
                  THis is that third
transmarine age
of the people of
Rome, in which employing
themselues vpon exploits
out of Italy, they display'd
their aduenturous
armes ouer the whole
earth. Of which age, the
first hundred yeeres were
holy, pious, &amp; (as we haue

already said) the age of
gold, voide of hainous fact,
or foule black deed, all the
while the simplenesse, and
puritie of that shepheardish
originall continued, and
the immiuent feare of the
Paenish-men maintain'd among
vs ancient discipline.
The other hundred
yeeres (which wee reckon
from the destruction of
Carthage, Corinth, Numance,
and from the date of
the last will, and testament
of king Attalus (in which
hee deuised his kingdome
in Asia) vp to Caesar,
and Pompey, and to
Augustus, who followed
them) as the glorie of martial
acts made stately great,

of so vast domestick mischiefes
made wretched, &amp;
worthie to bee blushed at.
For as it was noble, and
goodly to haue conquer'd
Gallia, Thrace, and Cilicia,
most fertil, and most powrfull
prouinces, the Armenians
also, &amp; Britans, great
names, but more for the honour
of the empire, then
for the vses thereof: so was
it a brutish, and a shamefull
thing to fight, and
bicker at home, at the
same time, with our owne
citizens, associates, bondmen,
fencers, and the
whole Senate with it selfe.
And I know not, whether
it had not beene better
for the people of Rome
                     
to haue rested content with
Sicilia, and Africk, yea, or
to haue wanted them also,
hauing Italie at command,
then to growe to such
greatnesse as to bee consumed
with their proper
strengths. For what other
things else bred ciuill furies,
but the too much
ranknesse of prosperitie?
The first thing which corrupted
vs, was the conquest
of Syria, &amp; next after that,
the heritage of the king of
Pergamus in Asia. The
wealth, and riches of those
countries were the things
which crusht vnder them
the morall vertues of that
age, and ouerthrew the
cōmonweal drownd in her

owne vices as in a common
sinke. For what cause was
there why the people of
Rome should stand so hard
for fields, or foode, but as
they were driuen by the
hunger which prodigalitie
had procured? From hence
therefore sprang the first,
and second Gracchan seditions,
&amp; that third Appuleian.
And out of what other
ground did it growe, that
the knights, and gentlemen
of Rome separated themselues
from the Lords, to
haue soueraigne power in
seates of iudgement, but
meerely out of couetousnes,
that so they might conuert
to priuate lucre the customary
paiments due to the

State, and euen iudgements
in law it self? This brought
in the promise of making
all Latium free of Rome.
from whence rose the war
with associats. And what
bred the warre with bondmen?
what? but the great
nūber of them in families?
whence came the armies
of fensers against their owners,
but for the excessiue
prodigality vsed in showes
for gaining popular fauour?
While the Romans giue
themselues ouer to showes
of sword-players, they
brought that to bee a profession,
and Arte, which
was before those times the
punishment of enemies.
And, to touch our more

gallant vices, was it not ouer-much
wealth which
stirr'd among vs riualities
in honours? Or did not the
stormes of Marius, and
Sylla, and the magnificent
furniture of feasts, &amp; sumptuous
presents, rise out of
that abundance, which are
long would bring forth
beggerie? This was it
which made Catiline fall
foule vpon his countrey.
To bee briefe, what other
fountaine had that very
desire in some of soueraignty,
&amp; to rule alone, but too
much store of wealth? But
that desire did mutually
arme Caesar and Pompey
with those mortall enmities,
which like the furies

firebrands set Rome on a
bright blaze. Our purpose
therefore is, to handle these
ciuill quarrels, distinguished
from iust, and foreine
warres, in order as they
fall.

                     THe power of the
Tribunes stir'd the
causes of all seditions,
vnder pretext of defending
the common people,
for whose helpe that
power was ordained, but
in very truth that the Tribunes
might ingrosse absolute
authoritie to themselues,

and for that cause
courted the commons for
their speciall fauour, &amp; good
will, by enacting lawes
which allotted them land,
corne, and seates of iudgement,
gratis. There was a
colour of equitie in each;
for what so iust, as the people
to receiue their right at
the hands of the Fathers
of the State? for them who
were the lords of nations,
and possessors of the earth,
not to liue like strangers to
their owne homes, and
temples? what more reasonable,
then that the poor
should liue vpon their own
eschequer? what could be
more effectuall to make the
templer of liberty euen, and

indifferent? then the Senate
gouerning prouinces, that
the cheualrie, and gentlemen
of Rome, to support
their authoritie at home,
should haue the as it were
kingdome of iudgementseates?
Yet euen these very
things turnd pernicious, &amp;
the wofull common-weale
came thereby to be the wages
of her proper ouerthrow:
for the cheualrie,
and inferiour nobles being
made iudges, which till
then the lords of Counsell
were, they purloynd the
publike incomes, that is to
say, the patrimonie of the
empire; and the paying
for the common peoples corn
out of the publike money,

suckt dry the very sinewes
of State, the treasury: and
how could the cōmon sort
be made landed men, without
eiecting thē who were
already in possession, and
were themselues also a portion
of the people? and
who held their seates of abode,
left them from their
ancestors, by prescription,
as a title of inheritance.

lands, though conquerours
of nations, and owners in
possession of the world, he
would prouide that they
should not liue like persons
banished from their household
Gods, and houses;
or what other motiue soeuer
else did set him on

worke to dare so mightie a
matter; true it is, that when
the day of propounding
the law was come, hee hauing
an huge troope to
guard him, mounted the
Rostra, nor wanted there
in readines all the nobility
against him, and the Tribunes
of the people in sides.
At which time Gracchus
seeing Marcus Octauius
crosse his propositions, he
pusht him downe from the
Rostra with his hand, contrary
to the religious respect
of brotherhood in
office, and the nature of
their authority, and put
him into that feare of present
death, as he was compeld
to giue ouer his Tribuneship:

                     and after this sort
getting himselfe to be created
one of the three for
parting the lands, when
vpon a comitiall day hee labourd
to haue his authoritie
continued for a longer
time, thereby to make good
his beginnings, the nobility,
and those whom hee
had disseised opposing him,
they fell to killing in the Forum,Caedes à faro coepit. 
                     and then through the
city; and flying from thence
to the Capitol, when touching
his head with his hand
to exhort the people, as by
a signe, to stand vpon their
guard for their liues, it
seemd as if hee demanded
a diadem: thereupon Scipie
Nasica inciting the people

to runne to their weapons,
he was beaten to the
earth, and slaine, as it were
by course of iustice.

and lawes, and with equall
vprore, and terror, as hee,
putting the common sort
into possession of their
forefathers lands, promising
to share among them
the late bequeathed kingdome
of Attalus, for

their maintenance. And
now growne ouer-mighty,
and powerfull by being
made Tribune againe, hee
was followed with the
commons as he flung vp, &amp;
downe, so that when Minucius
the Tribune aduentured
to abrogate his laws,
he trusting to the strength
of his complices, inuaded
the Capitol, a place fatal to
his house, and family. But
beaten from that attempt
with the slaughter of his
nerest friends, he withdrew
himselfe to mount Auentine.
But the forces of the
Senate meeting him, there
hee was destroy'd by Opimius,
Consul. There was
insulting vpon the dead

carcase also, and they who
muthred him, had for reward
the weight of his
head in gold, the head of a
Tribune of the people, religiously
sacred, and not to
haue beene violated.

                     Appuleius
Saturninus
desisted not from pressing
to make good the Gracchan
lawes. The fauour of
Marius gaue so much
boldnesse to the man,
being euer an enemy to
the nobility, and presuming

the more because
Marius was Consul, that
openly killing Aulus Nonius,
in the generall assembly,
his competitor in the
Tribuneship, hee attempted
to bring in Caius Gracchus
in his stead, a fellow of
no tribe, nor name, but
foysting in a pedigree, adopted
himselfe into the
family. Thus keeping such
tragicall reuels in the state
without being once call'd
to account for them, hee
bent his wittes so earnestly
to establish the Gracchan
lawes, as hee forced
the Senate to sweare to
what he would, threatning
the refusers to forbid them
fire, and water. There was

one neuerthelesse found,
who did rather choose to
bee banished. Therefore
when Metellus was once
fled, all the lords quailing,
and Appuleius tyrannizing,
now the third time Tribune,
grew so outragious, as
hee troubled euen the very
general assēblies made for
election of Consuls with
new slaughter. For, that
Glaucias, the vpholder and
minister of his madnesse,
might be made Consul, he
cōmanded his competitor
Caius Memmius to be slain:
&amp; when in that embroilement
those of his guard
call'd him KING, he heard
them gladly; but then, by
the ioynt opposition of the

Senate, Marius the Consul
himselfe now also making
one, because hee was not able
to beare him out, the
battels ioyn'd in the Forū.
From whence Appuleius
being beaten, he seiz'd vpō
the Capitol. But there they
besieged him by cutting off
the condit-pipes. Whervpon
his lieutenants assuring
the Senate he was sorry for
what was passed, hee came
down out of the castell, &amp;
was receiued, together with
the leaders of his faction,
into the Curia. Into which
the people breaking forceably,
ouerwhelm'd him
with clubs, and stones, and
tore him also to pieces as
he was in dying.

                  The Drusin sedition.
                  
                     LAST of these
boute-feus was Liuius
Drusus,
                     A. V. C. DCLXII. who
bearing himselfe strong
not onely vpon the force
of his Tribuneship, but vpon
the authority of the
Senate also, and hauing
the consent of all Italy, attempted
to induce the
same lawes; and while hee
serues turnes of one thing
after another, hee kindled
such a fire, that the very
first flash therof could not
be endured: and himselfe
taken off by sudden death,
left a long hereditarie

quarrel vpon his posterity.
Caius Gracchus by enacting
that law, Which tooke
the office of iudges from
the Senate, and conferr'd it
vpon the knights, and gentlemen,
had diuided the
people of Rome, and made
it a double-headed citie,
which was but single before.
And the Gentrie,
bold vpon their so mighty
power, as hauing thereby
the fates, and estates of the
Senatours, and the liues of
princes in their hand,
forestall'd the publike reuenewes,
and excises, and
robb'd the common-weale
in their owne right. The
Senate, weakned by the
banishment of Metellus,

and the condemnation of
Rutilius had lost all the
grace of maiestie. In this
condition of things, Seruilius
Caepio standing for the
Gentrie, and Liuius Drusus
for the Senate, two men of
equall riches, courage, and
calling (which bred that
emulation against Drusus)
ensignes, standards, and
banners were vpon the
point to aduance. Thus
differ'd they together in
one citie, as if it had beene
in two camps. Caepio gaue
the first on-set to the Senate,
and cull'd out Scaurus,
and Philip, the chiefes
of the nobility, as persons
guilty of practising for
places. Drusus, to resist

these commotions, wanne
the people to him by the
Gracchan lawes, and drew
the associats of Rome to the
people, by giuing hope
that they should all bee
made free of the citie. This
speech of his is yet remembred,
that hee had left nothing
in the state to bee giuen
to any one, vnlesse
that partie had a minde to
make a partition of mudde,
and clowds. The day of
promulgation of the law
was come, and so great
was the concourse from all
quarters about, that the citie
seem'd as if besieged
with the approach of enemies.
Philip, Consul, durst
notwithstanding speake against

the lawes. But the
vsher of the Court taking
him by the throat, did not
let him goe till the bloud
started into his face, and
eyes. So the lawes were
enacted perforce, and commanded
to passe for current.
Our fellowes, or associats
call'd out of hand
for the reward of their partaking.
Which Drusus vnable
to performe, and sicke
of the troubles into which
he had rashly entred, died
in season, confidering the
danger. But our fellowes in
armes forbare not neuerthelesse
to seeke the accomplishment
of Drusus
his promises, by hostility.

                  The Social warre.
                  
                     THe warre against
our fellowes &amp; associats,A. V. C. DCLXIII
howsoeuer
it be termed but the Social
warre, that so we might
extenuate the enuy; yet, if
wee will haue the truth, it
was a ciuill warre. Because
the people of Rome hauing
mixt the Etruscans,
Latins, and Sabins, and
deriuing one bloud out of
all, made an entire body
out of parts, and of them
all together is but one.
Nor was the rebellion of
our associats within Italy,
lesse heinous then that of

the Romans within the citie.
When therefore our
fellowes, and allyes most
iustly demanded equall
priuiledge with the Romans,
whose greatnes they
had increased with their
supports, and to the hope
whereof Drusus had raized
them vpon a desire to
predominate; and when
also he was opprest by the
wickednesse of those at
home; the same firebrand
of mischiefe which consumed
him, inflamed our cō
                     panions
and allyes, to take
armes, and force the citie:
what thing could be sadder
thē this vast mischief? what
more calamitous? when
all Latium, &amp; 
                        〈…〉
                     
                     
                     Etruria, and Campania, finally
Italie, rose ioyntly in
armes against the mother,
and foster citie? when euery
armie of our most valiant,
and most loyall fellowes
had vnder each ensigne
those municipall bad members,
and monsters of men?
Popedius led the Marses,
and Latins, Afranius the
Vmbrians, the whole Senate,
and Consuls, Samnium,
Telesinus led Lucania,
when the people, which
was the disposer of kings,
and nations, could not gouerne
it-selfe, so that Rome
conqueresse of Asia, and
Europe might bee assailed
from Corfinium. The beginning
of the warre was

plotted to be in mount Alban,
where, on the festiuali
day of the Latins, Sextus
Iulius Caesar, and Marcius
Philippus, Consuls, should
haue beene sacrificed betweene
the rites,sacra. and the
altars: but that treason being
frustrated by discoury,
the whole cōspiracie brake
out in Asculum, our ambassadours
who were then
present in that citie, being
killd in the assembly it-self,
at the publike playes. This
was the solemne signe of
the wicked war, and from
thence the alarme was euery-where
taken by al the
parts of Italie, Popedius posting
vp and downe, as the
captaine, and author of it.

Neither Pyrrhus, nor Aniball
committed so great a
spoile. Behold, Ocriculam,
behold Grumentum, behold
Faesulae, Carscoli, Nuceria,
and Picentes are wasted
with slaughter, sword, and
fire. The armie of Rutilius
is discomfired, discomfited
also is that of Caepio's:
for Lucius Iulius Caesar himself,
when the armie, which
he led, was ouerthrowne,
&amp; his dead body brought
all bloudy into Rome, made
such a solitarinesse with the
pitious spectacle, that one
might haue euen past
through the middle of the
citie quietly. But the great
good fortune of the people
of Rome, alwayes better

when at worst, puts at last
their vniuersal forces to the
worke, singling out seuerall
captaines against seuerall
people; Cato scatters the
Etruscans, Gabinius the
Marses, Carbo the Lucans,
Sylla the Samnites. But
Strabo Pompeius hauing
made hauocke of all with
fire, and sword, neuer gaue
ouer destroying, till he had
sacrificed the subuersion of
Asculum to the ghosts of
so many Consulary armies,
and to the Gods of so manie
ransackt cities.

                  The bondmens warre.
                  
                     THough wee fought
with our associates
(an hainous matter)
yet were they free-men
howsoeuer, and at leastwise
generous persons.
Who can patiently brook,
that the soueraigne people
of the earth should arme against
their slaues? The first
troubles of that base nature
were attempted in the yonger
dayes of Rome, &amp; within
the citie it-selfe, by Herdonius
Sabinus, captaine,
when the state busied with
the quarrels stirred by the
Tribunes, the Capitoll was

besieged, and taken by the
Consull. But this was rather
an vprore then a war.
But now, the empire being
mightily enlarged with diuers
countreys, who would
beleeue that the Iland of
Sicilie should be more cruelly
wasted in the warre against
slaues, then in the
Carthaginian? An excellent
corne countrey, and as
it were a purlieu of Rome,
where the Latine people
had their farmes, and granges;
for furniture of tillage
ther wer very many bride-wels,
&amp; husbandmen kept
in chaines, which ministred
matter for warre. A certaine
Syrian called Eunus
(the great mischiefs he did,

makes vs remember his
name) faining himselfe inspired
with a diuine furie,
while hee vaunts the ceremonies
of his Syrian goddesse,
call'd bondmen to
armes, and libertie, as it
were by authoritie from
heauen: and to get credit in
that point, he iuggled a nut
into his mouth, filld with
brimstone, and fire, and
blowing it softly, spat fire
as he spake. This coozning
wonder drew at the very
first two thousand of such
as came in his way, and eftsoones
breaking vp the
worke-iails, or bride-wells,
by right of warre, he made
vp an host of aboue fortie
thousand: &amp; that nothing

might bee wanting to the
euill, hee pranckt himselfe
vp like a king in royall ornaments,
and made miserable
spoile of castles, towns,
and villages: for a last disgrace,
the campes of our
Praetors were taken by
him; nor shames it to tell
their names; the camps of
Manlius, Lentulus, Piso,
Hysaeus. They therefore
who ought to haue beene
fetcht backe by officers as
fugitiues, pursued our Pratorian
Generals, whome
they had made to runne away
in set battell. In the
end yet we had the punishing
of them, Publius Rupilius,
our captaine Generall:
for after he had vanquisht

them in the field, and last of
all besieged them in Enna,
where hunger, like a plague
of pestilence, consumed
them, hee bound the remaynes
of those strong
theeues, in chaines, and fetters,
&amp; trussed them on gallowses:
and for this seruice
contented himselfe with anouation,
lest he should dishonour
the dignitie of triumph,
with carrying in the
inscription, the title of villaines.
The Iland had
scarce taken breath, when
by and by wee came from
the bondmen, and the Syrian
to the Cilician. Athenio,
a shepheard swaine,
murthers his master, and
freeing his fellowes out of

the work-iayle, puts them
vnder banners into battel-ray:
himselfe in a robe of
purple, with a staffe of siluer,
and about his head a
royall wreath, pieceth together
no lesse an armie
then the former mad man,
but rageth farre more eagerly
against masters, and
bondmen, as if against fugitiues,
and as if he would reuenge
the Sicilian bond-slaues
cause, sacking castles,
townes, and villages. This
varlet also had the killing
of Praetorian armies, the
campe of Seruilius taken by
him, and that of Lucullus in
like sort. But Aquilius, vsing
the example of Publius
Rupilius, vtterly distrest the

enemie by staruing, &amp; they
who were otherwise hard
to ouercome by force, hee
easily destroid by famine:
it was their desire to haue
yeelded, but through the
fear of the pains of punishment,
they preferred voluntarie
death: nay, wee
could not take vengeance
vpon the ringleader himselfe,
though he came aliue
into our hands: for very
many striuing together
whose prisoner hee should
be, the prey was torne in
pieces while they wrangled
about that interest.

                  The warre with Spartacus.
                  BVt bee it that wee
brooke the dishonour
of the bondmens
warre;A. V. C. DCLXXX for they are
lyable to good, or euill at
fortunes pleasure, &amp; thogh
they are but as it were a second
kinde of men, yet by
enfranchisemēt they are neuerthelesse
adopted sometime
into the sweets of
our freedome; the warre
which Spartacus raysed, I
am ignorant how to call it:
for where villaines were
the souldiers, and sword
players the captaines, those

the basest of men, these
augmented the worst of euils
with the scorne of so
vile indignitie. Spartacus,
Crixus, and Oenoma breaking
vp Lentulus his schole
of fence, with three score
and ten such companions
as themselues, or more,
burst out of Capua, and
calling bondmen to their
banners, and assistance,
when aboue ten thousand
sturdie bodies were assembled,
they were not then
contented onely to escape,
but they would also bee
reuenged. The first, as it
were alter, which pleased
them, was mount Vesuuius.
There being besieged by
Clodius Glaber, they slipt

downe the rifts of the hollow
mountaine by ropes of
twigges, and descended to
the lowest rootes thereof,
and suddenly forcing an
entrie at an issue of the
camp, where no such danger
was dreamt of, did surprize
it: after that, other
camps also. Then roue, and
wander they ouer Vhora,
and all Campania▪
                      nor satisfied
with wasting villages,
and hamlers, they make a
terrible destruction in Nola,
Nuceria, Thurij, and
Metapont. Their numbers
daily so increasing; as that
now they were a full army,
they make bucklers
of wouen osiars, couerd
with hides of beasts, and

forge out the yron of their
worke-iayles into swords,
and tooles of warre. And
that no grace of a full hoste
of men might be wanting,
they backe the horse which
they found at aduentures,
to raise a cauallery, and
brought to their captaine
the ensignes, and fasces
which were taken from our
Pretors. Nor refused hee
to vse them, though of an
hireling Thracian becomming
a souldier, of a souldier
a fugitiue, then a strong
theefe, and last of all, vpon
trust of his abilities of body,
a sword-player: who
celebrated the death of his
owne captaines slaine in
battell, with princely exequies,

commanding such as
he tooke prisoners, to fight
at sharp about the funerall
fire, as if it would cleere all
passed disgrace, if of a
sword-player, he became a
giuer of sword-games. After
this, setting also vpon
Consuls, he cut in pieces the
army of Lentulus in the
Appennine, raised the camp
of Caius Cassius at Mutina.
Puft vp with these successes,
hee deliberated (which is
enough to shame vs) of inuading
Rome it selfe. So,
in the end, we were glad to
put al our strengths against
a challenger at sharp,mirmillo. &amp; Licinius
Crassus was the man
who recouered our honour:
for the enemies (it is a

shame to giue them that
stile) beaten, and chased by
him, fled into the farthermost
nooks of Italie: there
they being shut vp into a
corner of Brutium, prepared
to escape into Sicilie,
but wanted shipping, and
hauing tride to supply that
defect with boats of hurdles,
and barrels bound together
with twigs, but al in
vain, by reason the current
was too swift, at last making
a sally, they dyed like
men, and (which was as it
should bee where the captaine
was a sword-player)
they fought without leaue.sine missisne.
                     Spartacus himselfe behauing
himselfe most valiantly
in the front, or head of

the battell, was slaine as
Prince and Generall.

                  The ciuill warre of
Marius.
                  
                     THis onely thing
was wanting to
make vp the euils
of the people of Rome to
the full,A. V. C. DCLXV. that there should
bee a paricidiall warre among
themselues at home,
and that citizens should encounter
citizens, as if they
were fencers, or sword-players,
in the heart, and
Forum of the citie, as in a
fighting ground, or theatrall
Sand. Howsoeuer, it

would grieue me the lesse,
had the leaders of that
wickednesse bin base companions,
or if noblemen
borne, yet debosht in their
manners. But O the sinne!
what men! what chiefes!
when they were the ornaments,
and glories of their
age, Marius and Sulla, who
vpheld that worst of hainous
euils with their vtmost
countenance. Things,
so to say, were planetstrucken
with three bad
influences; the first slight,
and little, and more properly
a broyle, then a war,
the cruelty, such as it was,
staying among the captaines
of the quarell themselues;
but the next was

more grimme, and bloudy,
such as had the vpper hand
embrewing their weapons
in the bowels of all the Senate;
the third outwent, in
the rage thereof, not ciuill
only, but hostill furie, when
the madnesse of reuenge
had all the strengths of Italie
to bolster it, their hatred
one of the other raging so
long, as till none were left
to kill. The beginning, and
cause of the warre, was the
insatiable thirst of honour
in Marius, while he labourd
by the law of Sulpitius to
take from Sulla his decreed
employment: but Sulla, impatient
of the iniurie, forthwith
turned about with
the legions which were

vnder his command, and
deferring the warre of Mithridates,
marcht into the
citie at port Esquiline, and
Colline gate in two great
battalions: from whence,
when Sulpitius, and Albinouanus
had suddenly repulsed
them, and logges, &amp;
stones, and tooles were
hurld vpon all sides from
off the walles, Sulla also
falls to throwing, openeth
his passage with fire, and
possesseth as a conquerour
the captiue Capitoll, that
fort which had escaped the
Paenish-men, yea and the
Galli Senones also. Then
by an act of the Senate,
Sulla's aduersaries proclaimed
enemies of the State,

they had law on their side
to rage against the present
Tribune, and most of the
contrary faction. Marius
by seruill flight saued himselfe,
or rather, fortune kept
him in store for another
warre. Cornelius Cinna,
Cnaeus Octauius Consuls, the
fire which was not well
put out rose afresh, and that
certainely by reason of the
disagreement, when it was
referred to the people,
whether such as the Senate
had proclaymed enemies
should bee recalled. They
came to this generall assembly
with their swords
about them: but they preuailing
who wished quietnesse,
Cinna, leauing the

citie, posted to his party.
Marius returnes from Africa,
the greater for calamity,
because prison,
chaines, flight, and banishment
had endeare his dignitie.
At the name therefore
of so great a man, there
is flocking to him from far,
and neere, bondmen (O
the hainousnesse!) &amp; sturdy
rogues were armd: and
the distressed Generall easily
found an army: so that,
as demanding restitution
to his countrey, out of
which he was expelled by
force, he might well seeme
to haue good reason for his
doing, had hee not otherwise
wrought his cause by
cruelty: but returning discontented

with Gods and
men, the hauen-towne Ostia
a pupill, and foster-child
of Rome, was at the
first assault taken, and with
horrible destruction pillaged.
From thence he enters
the citie in foure battels,
Cinna, Marius, Carbo, and
Sertorius leading them,
where, after that the whole
band of Octauius was beaten
from mount Ianiculum,
presently, vpon a signe
giuen, they fell to killing
the princes, and chiefe
lords, much more sauagely
then is vsed either in a
Paenish, or a Cimbrian citie.
The head of Octauius,
Consul, was pitcht vpon a
pole before the Rostra, and

the head of Antonius, a
Consularie man, was set on
the boord before Marius
himselfe: Casar, and
Fimbria were murthred
in that place of their
houses where their household
Gods stood, and
Crassus the father, and
son, each insight of other.
Bebius, and Numitor were
drawne with the hangmans
hookes through the
middle of the Forum. Catulus
freed himselfe from
being made the scorne of
his enemies by smothering.
Merula, Iupiters
priest, bespurtled the eyes
of Ioue himself, with the
bloud which sprung out
of his veines in the Capitol.

                     Ancharius was runne
through, Marius himselfe
looking on, because when
Marius saluted him, hee
reacht not out forsooth
that fatall hand of his.
These Senators he massacred
between the Calends,
and Ides of Ianuary, in that
seuenth Consulship of his.
What would haue become
of things, if after that proportion
of killing hee had
beene Consul but a yeere?
Scipio, and Norbanus Consuls,
that third worst whirlwinde
of ciuill surie thundred
forth with all the violence
it had; at which
time seuen legions of the
one side, on another fiue
hundred cohorts stood in

armes, and Sulla hastned
out of Asia with a victorious
army. And certainely,
Marius hauing shewed
himselfe so mercilesse towards
Sulla's friends, how
great cruelty was there
neede of, for Sulla to bee
euen with Marius? Their
first encounter was at
Capua by the riuer Vulturnus,
and there the army
of Norbanus was quickly
ouerthrowne, and all
Scipio's forces, vpon colourable
ouerture of
peace, speedily oppressed.
Then Marius the yonger,
and Carbo, Consuls, as if
the hope they had to get
the victorie were quite
dead, yet not to perish vnreuenged,

they parentated
to themselues with the
bloud of the Senate. And
besetting the Senate-house,
such of the Senate,
whose throats they meant
to cut, were drawne out
from thence, as out of a
sheep-penne, or prison.
What slaughters were
there in the Forum, in
the Circus, and open
Temples? For MVTIVS
SCAEVOLA, the priest,
embracing the altar of
Vesta in his atmes, is onely
not buried in her fire.
Lamponius, and Telesinus,
ringleaders of the Samnits,
waste Campania, and Etruria
more dreadfully then
Pyrrhus and Annibal did,

and vnder the colour of
siding, reuenge themselues.
The whole forces
of the enemies were quite
distrest at Sacriport, and
port Collin, or Hill-gate.
There Marius, and here
Telesinus were destroyed.
But warre, and slaughter
ended not together. For
the sword was vnsheathed
euen in peace, and they
who freely yeelded themselues,
were also depriued
of their liues. It is not
lesse hainous, that Sulla, at
Sacriport and Hill-gate,
did cut in pieces aboue
threescore and ten thousand.
But then it was war.
Hee commanded aboue
foure thousand vnarmed

citizens, who had yeelded
themselues, to bee put to
the sword in the publike
village. These though so
many slaine in cold bloud,
yet are no more then foure
thousand. But who can
number them who were
kill'd euery-where thorowout
the citie by any
one who lifted? till Furfidius
admonished, that
some ought to bee left aliue,
that there might be ouer
whom to commaund.
Hereupon was that huge
table hung out, in which
two thousand by name,
cull'd forth of the very
flowre of the Senate,
knights, and gentlemen,
were proclaimed to die.

A new kinde of edict. It
were tedious, after al these
things, to historifie the killing
in cruel sport of Carbo,
of Soranus, the Praetor, and
of Venuleius, and how Baebius
was not slaine with
the sword, but torne in
pieces with hands, as with
the pawes of sauage beasts.
How Marius, brother of
the Generall Marius, was
thrust with his eyes, hands,
and thighes into the earth,
before the tombe of Catulus,
and in that state kept
so aliue, as hee might sensibly
feele himselfe die in
euery part. To let passe almost
all the seuerall formes
of death vsed vpon seuerall
persons: the statelyest

free-townes of Italy were
sold as at an outrop, who
would giue most, Spoletum,
Interamnium, Praeneste,
Fluentia. For as for
Sulmo, that ancient confederate,
and friend-citie,
not yet conquer'd, Sulla
(O vnworthy fact!) commanded
it to bee vtterly
razed, condemning it no otherwise
then as hostages
condemn'd by the law of
armes, and accordingly
sentenced to death, are
commanded forth to execution.

                     WHat other thing
else was the Sertorian
warre,A. V. C. DCLX XIV. then
the inheritance of Sulla's
proscription? Whether I
should stile it an hostile, or
a ciuill warre, I know not,
as that which the Lusitanians,
and Celtiberians
acted, hauing a Roman to
their Generall. Hee was a
man of an excellent rare,
but of a disastrous valour,
out-law'd for his life, and
flying that most deadly
proclamation, hee tossed
both sea, and land with

mixture of his miseries:
and trying his fortune now
in Africa, then in the
Balearies, and sent from
thence into the Ocean, past
thorow to the Fortunateilands,
and lastly armed
Spaine, where, as a man
with men, hee easily made
head, nor did the couragious
brauerie of Spanish
souldiers appeare in any
place more plainely, then
when a Roman led them,
though not contented
with Spaine alone, he minded
Mithridates also, and
the Ponticks, ayding him
with a nauie. What had
beene able to resist so potent
an enemie? The
world could not withstand

by onely one captains
meanes. Cnaeus Pompeius
was ioyned to Metellus.
They wasted the puissance
of Sertorius in battell,
though it was long
first, and neuer but with
doubtfull fight, nor at last
by faire warre; for hee was
dispatcht through the villanie,
and treason of his
familiar friends: and our
captaines hauing traced his
armies almost ouer all
Spaine, did neuer encounter
his, but the battell was
alwayes long, and hazardous.
The first proofe wee
made of his abilities was by
lieutenants generall, when
Domitius, and Thorius vpon
the one side, and the

                     Herculeij vpon the other
made some light skirmishes:
but these being eftsoones
slaine at Segouia,
and those at the riuer
Anas, the Generals themselues
comming to try it
out in person at Lauro, and
Sucron, parted each with
equall mischiefe done to
either. They turning
then their power to waste
the countrey, and these to
the subuersion of cities,
wretched Spaine smarted
for the quarrels of the Roman
captaines one against
the other, till such time as
Sertorius muthered by
practice of his house-hold
friends, and conquer'd
Perperna, submitting himselfe,

the cities Osea, Terme,
Tutia, Valentia, Auximia,
and, which had endured
the worst of hunger, Calaguris,
sware feaulty to the
Romans. So Spaine receiued
into peace, the victorious
Generals had rather it
should seeme a foraine
warre then a ciuill, because
they would triumph.

                     Quintus
Catulus, Consuls,
the ciuill warre
was almost sooner determined
then taken in hand.

But how much, and how
far soeuer in compasse the
firebrand of that commotion
blazed, it rose all out of
Sylla's ashes: for Lepidus,
in his insolencie, desirous
to innouate, prepared to
annull the acts of that
mighty man, nor without
good cause, if at least wise it
could haue beene done
without great calamitie to
the common-weale. For
when Sulla, the Dictator,
had by the aduantage of
the vpper hand, proscribed
his enemies; such of them
as ouerliued, being recalled
from banishment by Lepidus,
to what else were they
called but to warre? and
when the goods of attainted

citizens were adiudged,
and giuen away by Sulla
vnto others, though they
were but badly taken, yet
being they were taken by
law, the repleuin of them
did doubtlesly endanger
the greene raw peace of the
State. For which respect it
was expedient that the
common-weale sore sicke,
and hurt, should rest it selfe
howsoeuer, lest the wounds
thereof should breake out,
and bleede afresh in the
curing. When therefore he
had frighted the citie with
his turbulent orations, as
with an alarme, he went
into Etruria, and from
thence presented an armie
against Rome. But, before

this time, Lentulus, Catulus,
and Cnaeus Pompeius,
the captaines, and as it were
ensigne-bearers of Sulla's
tyranny, had planted an
army at Miluius bridge, &amp;
mount Ianiculus: and by
them repulsed at the very
first brunt, and proclaimed
traitor by the Senate, hee
fled backe without bloudshed
into Etruria; from
thence retired to Sardinia;
and there in sicknesse, and
repentance ended his dayes.
The victors, a thing rarely
seene in ciuill warres, moderated
their affections, and
contented themselues to
hold all quiet.

                     CATALINE,A. V. C. DCXC. mooued
to it, first
with riot, and
then with want,
the effect of that excesse,
together with the opportunitie,

our armies beeing
then in warfare at the vtmost
bounds of the earth,
was thrust into a treason
for inthralment of his natiue
countrey, for assassinate
of the Senatours, for
murther of the Consuls,
for firing the citie in many
places at once, for robbing
the Exchequer, and in a
word, for vtter extirpation
of all common-weale, and
for doing that, whatsoeuer
else, which euen Anniball
himselfe would not haue
seem'd to haue wished. All
which purposes, with what
complices (O the sinne!)
were they by him attempted?
himselfe a Patritian, a
Senatour of the highest

ranke; but that is not so
much: there were in of the
Curij, Porcij, Sullae, Cethegi,
Autronij, Vargunteij,
and Longini: and what
potentates were they by
birth? what ornaments of
the Senate? Lentulus likewise,
chiefely at that time
Praetor, had all of these for
a blacke guard to his most
black designes. Mans bloud
was added as a pledge of
the conspiracie, which carried
about in cups and goblets,
they dranke: a most
horrible thing, had not the
end, for which they dranke
it, beene more horrible.
The goodliest empire vnder
heauen had seene the
last daies of it selfe, had not

that plot hapned in the
Consulship of Cicero, and
Antonius, one of which
discouered the same by his
diligence, the other confounded
it by force. The
intelligence of this so vast a
treason was giuen by Fuluia,
a base cheape trull, but
not so wicked as to be guiltie
of paricide. Then Cicero
the Consull, calling a Senate,
made an oration against the
hainous traytor to his face,
against the guiltie person
there in presence, but
wrought no greater effect
then onely to make the foe
shift for himselfe, and openly
professing to bee such,
threatned to put out the
fire with pulling downe all.

So he departs to the armie
which Manlius had prepared
in Etruria, with purpose
to assaile the citie. Lentulus,
diuining that himself
was the man of his family,
to whom soueraigntie was
destinated in Sibylls verses,
had in fit places, against the
set day, dispersed men, fireworkes,
and weapons ouer
the whole citie: nor contented
with complices at
home onely, the ambassadours
of the Allobroges, at
that time, as it hapned, in
towne, were dealt with, to
stirre their nation to armes:
and the frensie had gadded
ouer the Alpes, if vpon another
discouerie made by
Vulturius, the letters of the

Praetor had not beene attached
in the going. Hands
were hereupon forthwith
laid, at Cicero's commandement,
vpon the Allobroges:
and the practice was openly
proued against Lentulus
in the Senate. It being
put to the question
what should be done with
the malefactors, Caesar was
of opinion, their liues
should be spared, because
they were persons of great
honor: Cato censur'd them
to death for their treason:
which opinion was seconded
by all, and they were
strangled accordingly in
prison. Though thus a
part of the conspiracie was
choakt, yet Catiline desisted

not from his enterprise,
but with ensignes spred
marcheth out of Etruria, against
his natiue countrey,
and encountred on the way
by the armie of Antonius,
is beaten downe, and slaine.
How grimly they fought,
the euent sheweth: not a
man of the enemies was
left, and looke what place
each one fought in, vpon
the same he lost his life, and
couerd it with his body.
Catiline was found starke
dead farre off from his own
company among the carkases
of his enemies: a most
braue end, had he made it
for his countrey.

                  The warre of CAESAR, and
POMPEY.
                  
                     THe whole world
almost being now
in peace, the Roman
empire was greater
then that it could be extinguisht
by any foraine violence.
Fortune therefore
beating enuie to that people,
which was soueraigne
of al other, armd their own
selues to their owne destruction.
The madnesse of
Marius, and Ginna confined
it-selfe within the citie,
as if shee tride how it
would doe; the tempest of
Sulla spred wider, yet did

it not thunder out of Italy;
but the furie of Caesar, and
Pompey did hurrie, &amp; sucke
into it both the citie, Italy,
races, nations, &amp; in a word
the vniuersall empire, with
a kind as it were of deluge,
and gulph of fire, so farre
forth, that it cannot rightly
bee onely called a ciuill,
neither yet a sociall, no nor
a foraine, but rather a certaine,
common of all together,
and more then a war.
For if wee looke vpon the
captaines, the whole Senate
was in sides; if the armies,
on the one part eleuen legions,
on the other, eighteen,
the flower, &amp; strength
together, of all the Italian
bloud; if the aides of the

confederates, on this side,
the choise of the Galls, &amp;
Germans, on that, Deiotarus,
Ariobarzanes, Tarcondimotus,
Cothus, the whole
powers of Thrace, Cappadocia,
Cilicia, Maccdonia,
Greece, Italy, and all the
Orient; if the space of the
warre, foure yeeres, and
that, considering the destructions
it wrought, but
a short time; if the place,
and flage, vpon which it
was acted, Italy, frō whence
it turn'd it selfe into Gall,
and Spaine, and fetching a
compasse from the west,
it sat down with the whole
burthen thereof vpon Epirus,
and Thessaly; thence it
crosseth suddenly into

                     Aegypt; then it glanced
into Asia, and lay heauy
vpon Africk; last of all, it
reel'd back into Spaine, and
there at length it went
out, and died. But the
warre, and hatred of the
factions ended not together.
For that rested not, til
the rancour of the conquer'd
parties had in the
heart of the citie, &amp; middle
of the Senate, satisfide it
self with the bloud of their
conquerour. The cause
of so monstrous mischiefs
was the same, which it vseth
to be of al, too too
much prosperity. For Q.
Metellus, and Lucius Afranius,
Consuls, when the
maiestie of Rome preuailed

through the world, and
the people chanted the
fresh victories of Pompey,
the Pontick, and Armenian
triumphs, in Pompeis theaters,
his ouer-great power
(as it often falleth out) moued
enuy among the leysurable
citizens, Metellus for
abatement of his triūph ouer
Crete, Cato, who alwaies
ranne bias to the mighty,
detracted Pompey, &amp; found
fault with his actions. The
griefe hereof draue him awrie,
and compelled him
to prouide strengths for
vpholding his dignitie. It
hapned Crassus at that
time flourished in honour
of bloud, riches, and authoritie,
and yet still coueted

more. The name of
Caius Caesar was vp, for eloquence,
and spirit, and
had the honour of a Consulship.
But Pompey ouertopt
them both. Caesar
therefore struggling to get
dignity, Crassus to increase
it, Pompey to keepe what
he had, and all of them alike
greedie of great
power, easily made a match
to set vpon the commonweale.
Therefore, while
each of them vseth the others
strengths for his own
glory, Caesar inuaded Gall,
Crassus▪ Asia, Pompey Spain,
three most puissant armies.
And thus the whole world
was now become to bee
held by three princes in

partnership. This domination
wore out ten yeeres
time. From that time forward,
because til then they
were ballanced among thē
                     selues
through a mutuall
feare, vpon the slaughter of
Crassus by the Parthians,
and the death of Iulia, Caesars
daughter, who marrying
to Pompey, maintained
concord between the son,
and father in law, by the
league of nuptial loue, emulation
brake forth presently.
Pompey now was iealous
of Caesars greatnesse,
and Caesar badly endured
Pompeis supereminencie.
The one brookt no equall,
the other no superior. But
O the sinne! they stroue in

such sort for principality,
as if so great a fortune of
empire had not beene ennough
for two. Therefore
Lentulus, and Marcellus
being Consuls, and the affiance
of the first pact among
them once broken,
the Senate consulted to disemploy
Caesar, and Pompey
labour'd the same; nor was
Caesar himselfe against it, if
in the first comitiall assembly,
or choise-moot,
there had beene respect
had of him, for the Consulship;
which honour ten
Tribunes had with Pompeis
good liking decreed
him in his absence, and was
afterwards, vpon Pompeis
dissembling, denyed it. He

should haue come, &amp; sued
for it after themore maiorum. old wont.
On the other side, hee earnestly
demanded execution
of the decree, &amp; would
not cashier his armie, vnlesse
they at home were as
good as their word to him.
For this cause he was proclaimed
enemy. Caesar,
throughly nettled at the
newes, resolued to maintaine
with the sword, the
rewards of his sword. The
first field, &amp;arena. Sand-plot of
ciuil war was Italy; whose
castels Pompey had furnisht
with slight-garrisons. But
all of them were as it were
ouerwhelmed with Caesars
sudden comming-on. The
first alarm was sounded at

                     Ariminū. Then was Libo
more thē al Etruria, Thermus
then Vmbria, Domitiꝰ
then Corfinium. And the
war had bin made an end
of without bloud, if, as hee
attempted it, he could haue
oppressed Pompey at Brundisium.
But he escaped by
night through the closures
of the besieged hauen. A
shamful matter to be spokē:
the late president of the Senat,
vmpire of peace, &amp; war,
fled in a torne, &amp; almost naked
vessell, ouer that sea,
which himself had triūpht.
Nor is Pompey sooner driuē
out of Italy, then the Senat
out of the citie, into which
almost empty of people
throgh feare, Caesar entring

made himself Consul. The
sacred inmost treasury, because
the Tribunes op'ned
it somewhat too slowly, he
cōmanded to be broken vp:
&amp; violently seis'd the reuenew,
and patrimony of the
people of Rome, sooner then
he did the soueraignty. Pō
                        pey
driuen away, &amp; fled, he
had a more minde to take
order for securing the prouinces,
then to pursue him.
He kept Sicilia, &amp; Sardinia,
the publick pledges of corn,
by deputies, or lieutenants
generall: there was not an
enemy in Gall, himself had
made it all peace there. But
passing in persō against the
Pompeis in Spaine, Massilia
was so bold as to shut her

gates. Poore Massilia,
while it would faine haue
peace, fel into a war, throgh
feare of warre. But because
it had strong walls, he commanded
it should be taken
for him in his absence. A
Greekish citie, but which
more hardly then for the
name it had lopt bauins for
rampire, durst burn the engins
bent against it, and encounter
vs at sea. But Brutus,
who had the charge of
the war, tamed them quite
both at land, &amp; sea: wherupon
yeelding themselues,
they were stript out of all
they had, excepting that
(which they prized aboue
all) their common libertie.
Caesar's war in Spaine with

                     Petreius, &amp; Afranius, lieutenants
generall to Cnaeus
Pompeius, was doubtfull,
various, and bloudy, attempting
to besiege their
campe at Ilerda by the riuer
Sicoris, and to thrust
betweene them, and the
towne. In the meanewhile
by stopping the
stream, whichin the springtime
vsed to swell,verni fluminis obundatione. they depriued
him of victuals. So
his campe was assaulted
with famine, and the besieger
himselfe remain'd
as it were besieged. But
so soone as the water was
down,sed vbi pax fluminis redit. he scowres the coasts
with fire, and sword, and
fiercely re-enforceth his
pursuit, &amp; ouertaking them

vpon their retreate into
Celtiberia, hee drew a
trench about, and so compeld
them to yeeld for
thirst. Thus was the hither
Spaine taken in, and
the farther Spaine delayd
not. For what could one
legion do, when fiue could
doe nothing? Varro therefore
of his owne accord giuing
way, the Gades, the
streights, the Ocean, and all,
followed the luckinesse of
Caesar. But fortune durst
doe somewhat against that
captaine in his absence, on
this side Illyricum, and in
Africa, as if his faire successes
were of purpose to
be styrped, and inter-wouen
with crosse accidents: for

when Dolabella, and Antonius
being commanded
by Caesar to guard the iawes
of the Adriaticke gulph,
and the one had pitcht his
camp vpon the Illyrian
shore, the other on the
Corcyrean, Pompey being
master then at sea, Octauius
his lieutenant generall,
and Libo, with huge
numbers of mariners, closed
them in vpon all hands,
and Antonius, despite of
his most resistance, was enforced
to yeelde through
famin: and those long boats
sent to his aide by Basillus,
such as for lacke of ships
they were faine to shift
with, were taken as it were
in an hunting toyle, by a

new stratagem of the Cilicians
on Pompeis side, the
fastning of ropes vnder water:
but the tide comming
in, freed two of the vessels:
one of them which carryed
the Opitergins was entangled
in the cords, &amp; produced
an effect worthy to be
commended with honour
to posterity: for a band of
scarce one thousand young
fellowes held play from
morning till night, against
the force of an whole armie,
enuironing them on
all sides: and when by manhood
they could finde no
way forth, at the encouragement
of Vulteius, their
Coronel, they slue one the
other. In Africke also, such

like was the valour, and
aduersitie of Curio, who
sent by Caesar with commission
to receiue that prouince,
&amp; proud for hauing
repulsed, and put Varus to
flight, was vnable to stand
the sudden comming-on
of king Iuba, and the cauallerie
of the Mauritanians.
Hee might haue fled, but
shame perswaded him to
die together with that army
which his temerity had
cast away. But fortune now
importunately demanding
to make scores euen, Pompey
had chosen Epirus for
the seate of war: nor was
Caesar slowe: for hauing
made all safe at his backe,
though it were the depth

of winter, and so the season
vnfit, yet hee embarkt
for battell; and encamping
at Oricum; when that part
of his forces which was left
behinde with Antonius, for
want of shipping staid with
the longest at Brundisium;
hee was so impatient, that
for fetching them, hee attempted
at midnight, and
in a frigat to venture ouer,
though the sea was terrible
rough. His words to the
master, afraid at so great a
danger, are not forgotten.
What fearest thou? thou
carryest Caesar. When all
the forces which either
side could make, were
drawne together, &amp; their
camps confronted each the

other the generals gouernd
themselues by diffrēt courses.
Caesar naturally fierce, &amp;
longing to dispatch, offers
battell, eggeth, and prouoketh
to it: one while by
besieging the camp, about
which his workes ran sixteene
miles (but what
could besieging hurt them,
who hauing the sea open,
abounded thereby with all
prouisions?) another while
with assaulting Dyrrhachium
in vaine (for the situation
of it made it inexpugnable)
and besides all this,
with daily skirmishes, as
the enemie sallied forth (at
which time captain Sceua's
manhood was admired, in
whose target one hundred,

&amp; twenty shot were found
sticking) now with sackage
of Pompeis confederate cities,
as when hee wasted
Oricum, and Gomphi, and
other fortresses of Thessali,
Pompei, on the contrarie,
contriues delayes, and
wayes of putting of, that,
by closing the enemy on all
parts, hee might breake his
heart with lack of victuals,
and the violent humor of
his most fiery aduersarie
might coole, &amp; falter. This
wholsome counsell did not
long auaile the author▪ the
soldier, hee blames lying
idle, confederates cry out
vpon delay, and the great
lords tax him with ambition.
So the destinies thrusting

thinges headlong on, in
Thessaly, and the champain
fields of Philippi, chosen
for the place of fight,
the fortunes of Rome, the
world, and all mankinde
were set vpon a cast. The
people of Rome neuer saw
in one place together so
great forces, nor fortune so
many mighty persons at a
time. There were aboue
three hundred thousand
in both the armies, besides
the aides of kings, and Senators.
Signes of an imminent
downefall were neuer
more apparent; runnings
away of beasts ordaind for
sacrifice, swarmes of bees,
notable ouercastings of the
skie in day time. Pompey
                     
himselfe dreamt ouernight,
that he heard a noise
in his owne theater at
Rome, sounding about him
in the nature of a mourning,
and in the breake of
day hee was seene (fie vnluckie!)
before his maine
battel in a black vpper garment
Caesars armie was neuer
more fresh,pullo amiculo. &amp; fuller of
spirit. The sound of the
charge came first from
Pompeis side, but the shot
from the other. The iauelin
of Crastinus, who
began the fight, was noted:
and being runne into
the gaping mouth with a
sword, and found dead
with it so, among the carcases,
did by the nouelty

it selfe of the wound, well
declare, with what choler,
and madnesse hee fought:
neither was the issue of the
battell lesse admirable: for
whereas Pompey had such
multitudes of horse, as hee
thought to circumuent Caesar
easily, himselfe was circumuented:
for after they
had fought a long time vpon
euen termes, and, at a
signe giuen them by Pompey,
his troupes of horse fell
on in flanke, the Germane
cohorts made so boystrous
an impression vpon the riders,
that they seemd footmen,
&amp; these to haue come
on horsbacke: the ouerthrow
of the light-armd
souldiers ensued vpon the

slaughter of the flying horstroupes:
then the terrour
striking farther, one companie
putting another into
rowt, the rest of the destruction
was made as it were
at a stroke. Nothing was
more the bane of that day,
then the hugenesse it-selfe
of the armie. Caesar was
much in that battell, and
halfe between souldier and
soueraigne: speeches of his
were ouer-heard as hee rid
vp, and downe; the one
bloudy, but according to
the Art of the sword, and
powerfull for gaining the
day, Souldiers, foine at the
face; the other tending to
vaine glorie, Souldiers, spare
our countrey-men; when his

owne selfe notwithstanding
chased them. Happie Pompey,
for all this miserie, had
hee shared in the fortune of
his slaughtred armie: but
he ouer-liued his own glorie,
that with the more dishonour
he might poste for
his life through Thessalian
Tempe; bee beaten from
Larissa; and vpon a forlorn
rocke of Cilicia, studie, whether
he should flie into Parthia,
Africa, or Aegypt;
briefely, that vpon the Pelusian
shore, by the command
of a most vnworthie
king, by the counsell of gelded-men,
and (to take all
the misfortunes together)
that murthred by the
sword of Septimius, his fugitiue,

vnder the eyes of his
wife, &amp; children, he should
conclude his dayes. Who
would thinke that the war
should not bee determined
with Pompeis life? But the
embers of the Thessalian
fire waxt much more hot,
and forceable then euer:
and in Aegypt there was
warre without any partakings
of ours: for when Ptolomea,
king of Alexandria,
had committed the most
hainous act of all those other
which were committed
during the ciuill warre,
and had, by means of Pompeis
head, settled his owne
termes with Caesar, fortune
casting about for a reuenge,
therby to appease the ghost

of so great a potentate,
wanted not occasion. Cleopatra,
that kings sister,
throwing herselfe at Caesars
feet, besought restitution
to her part of the realme.
To plead for her, came
the ladies beauty, which
was doubled by this, that
so rare a creature seem'd to
haue wrong, &amp; the hatred
born to the king himselfe,
who, in killing Pompey, gratifide
the fortune of the
contrarie faction, not Caesar,
against whom hee would
also, without all question,
haue dared as much, if it
would haue serued his
turn. Whē 
                     Caesars pleasure
therefore was, that shee
should bee restored to her

kingdome, by as it were a
Gauelkind, he being forthwith
be-set in the palace
roial, by the same instrumēts
who murthred Pompey,
with wondrous valour,
&amp; a slender company, did
beare the brunt of a mighty
army. For, by firing the
next tenements, &amp; the Arsenal,
he dislodged the enemie,
who plide him from
thence with shot. From
thence he suddenly escaped
to the penile of Pharus.
Beaten out of that, &amp; glad
to plunge into the sea, hee
got, with admirable good
fortune, to the next ships,
by swimming, fain to leaue
his robe in the waues, whether
by chance, or of purpose,

that the aduersarie
might pelt, &amp; mawl it with
stones, and shot, in stead of
him. Receiued at last among
his own mariners, &amp;
assailing the enemy in all
quarters at once, hee paide
the ghost of his son in law
the vengeance due to it,
vpon that cowardly, and
trayterous nation. For
not onely the kings tutor,
Theodorus, (author of
the whole warre) but not
so much also as those
maskes of men, the Eunuchs,
Photinus, &amp; Ganymedes,
flying by sea, and land,
came to euill ends. The
yong kings body was found
as it lay wallowed vnder
mud, and known by the honor

of a golden curace, or
brest plate vpon it. New stirs
were likewise in Asia, begun
in Pontus, fortune watching
as it were of set purpose,
to make this the end of
Mithridates kingdom, that
the father should bee conquer'd
by Pompey, and the
sonne by Caesar. King
Pharnaces, rather vpon
trust of our discord, then
his owne valour, fell vpon
Cappadocia with an offensiue
armie. But Caesar setting
vpon him, in onely one,
and that too (so to say) not
an whole battell, ground
him as it were to dust,
after the manner of lightning,
which at one, and
the same moment of time,

came, hit, and went away:
neither was it a vaine brag
which Caesar made of himselfe,
that the enemie was
ouerthrowne there, before
euer hee set eye vpon
him. Thus went matters in
forreine parts. But in Africk,
the fight of Romans
with Romans was more
deadly, then it had beene in
Pharsalia. Hither the remaines
of the shipwrackt
faction were driuen by a
certaine pang, or fit of fury:
nor would you call them
remaines, but a whole, and
entire warre. Pompeis forces
were rather scatterd
then consumed. His tragedy
made them more
solemne, and zealous to

fight. Nor did the succeeding
Generals degenerate.
For Cato, and Scipio
founded full enough in the
place of Pompeis name. Iuba,
king of Mauritania,
made one in the quarrell,
forsooth that Caesar might
haue the more to conquer.
There was therefore no
difference, nor oddes betweene
Pharsalia, and
Thapsus, sauing that the
eagernesse of the Caesarians
was both the more, &amp; the
more sharpe, as chafing
that the war grew though
Pompey was dead. To bee
briefe, a thing which neuer
hapned till then, the trumpets
sounded a charge,
through the souldiers forwardnesse,

without the
cōmandement of the General.
The ouerthrow beganne
at Iuba, whose elephants
not throughly manned
to fight, and but lately
taken wilde out of the
woods, quite confounded
at the sudden shrilnesse,
forthwith dis-ranked their
friends army, &amp; made that
the captaines could not escape
by flying, all of them
comming to their ends remarkably.
For Scipio was
now gotten on ship-boord,
but his enemies ouertaking
him, he ran his sword
thorow his owne belly; &amp;
one asking after him in
search, he answered in these
very words, The Generall is

well. Iuba gotten into his
palace, after a royal banquet
made to Petreius, the
companion of his flight,
among his cuppes, and dishes
call'd vpon him for a
killing. And Petreius had enough
of that both for the
king, and himselfe: so the
viands, halfe as it were eaten,
and the funerall messes
swam mixt with royall,
and Roman bloud together.
Cato was not at
this battell, but encamping
at Bagrada, hee
lay for defence of Vtica,
as at the other maine
fort, or barre of Africa.
But hearing the defeat
of his partners, hee dallied
not at all, but (as it

became a wiseman) did
euen ioyfully hasten his
owne death. For after hee
had embraced, and bidden
good night to his son, and
companions, hee reposed
himselfe awhile in his bed,
hauing perused by a light
Plato's booke of the Immortality
of the soule, and
then, about the first releeuing
of the watch, vnsheathing
his sword, hee therewith
thrust himselfe with
a re-enforced stroke into
the body. After which, the
physicians presumed to
wrong the braue man with
laying salues, which he permitted
till they were out
of the roome: but then hee
rashed them away, and the

bloud following amaine, he
left his dying hands in the
very wound. Warre, and
sidings brake out againe, as
fresh, as if there had neuer
past a stroke in the quarrell:
and by how much
the troubles in Africa
were beyond those in Thessaly,
by so much Spaines
surpassed those in Africa;
&amp; the brother linesse of the
Generals drew exceeding
sauor to that side, when for
one Pompey there stood vp
two. The encounters therfore
were no where so terrible,
or hazardous. The
first conflict was in the very
mouth of the maine Ocean,
Varius, and Didius oppositely
lieutenants generall.

but the strife with the sea
it selfe, was sorer then that
of Fleete with Fleete: for
the Ocean, as it were to
chastize owne countreymen
for their madnesse,
dasht indifferently of either
of their nauies in
pieces. What a ghastly,
and hideous sight was that,
when at one, and the same
instant, seas, stormes and
tackle fought together!
Adde to all this, the fearefull
situation of the place,
where the shores of Spain,
and Mauritania on this
coast, and on that, doe offer
in a manner to claspe,
and meete the sea both mediterranean,
&amp; maine Ocean,
and Hercules pillars,

                     opposite mountaines, hanging
ouer. At which time,
foule weather, and fierce
battell raged round about.
After this, both parts ranged
here &amp; there, employing
themselues in the siege
of cities; whose case was
miserable, while betweene
the leaders of seuerall sides,
they smarted deepely for
their friendship with the
Romans. The last battell of
all was at Munda. Here the
fight was not answerable to
the felicity of other fights,
but doubtfull for a long
time, and discontentiue; so
as fortune plainely seemed
to deliberate vpon the doing
of some, I know not
what, thing. Certainely,

                     Caesar himselfe was seene
before the armie sadder
then for his wont, whether
in regard of humane frailty,
or as suspecting that
the excesse of prosperitie
would not hold out alwayes,
or as fearing the
same things which Pompey
found, so soone as once
he came to be what Pompey
was: but in the very battell
it selfe, after the armies had
with equall slaughter done
nothing for a long space
but kill, suddenly (the like
whereof no man liuing
could remember) in the
most heate of the fight,
there was a deepe silence
on both sides, as if they
were agreed▪ this was euery

ones coneit of it. Last of all,
which Caesar in foureteene
yeeres before had neuer
seene, the selected tride
band of his old souldiers
(an hainous matter) gaue
backe: so that although
they fell not as yet to flat
running away, nothing
was playner notwithstanding,
then that they resisted
more for pure shame,
then valour. Caesar therefore
putting his horse from
him, ranne like a mad-man
into the head of the battell:
there hee staid such as were
shrinking, cōfirming them,
and finally cried, and flew
through all the squadrons
with his eyes, and hands in
that perturbation, it is reported

hee debated within
himselfe, what to doe with
himselfe, if the worst befell,
and his countenance
was, as of a man, who
meant to make his owne
hand his owne executioner,
had not fiue cohorts
of the Pompeian horse crossing
the battell, as sent by
Labienus to guard the
campe in danger, giuen a
semblant of flying: which
either Caesar did himselfe
beleeue, or cunningly laying
hold vpon the occasion
of that seeming, charged
as vpon flyers, and did
thereby both put fresh spirit
into his owne people,
and did also daunt his enemies:
for his people

thinking they had the vpper
hand, followed the
more boldly, and the Pompeians,
while they supposed
their fellowes ranne away,
did fall themselues to running.
How great the slaughter
was of the enemies, and
the wrath, and furie of the
victorious, may bee by this
coniectured: such as escaped
out of the field, betaking
themselues to Munda,
and Caesar commanding
them to bee forth with besieged,
a rampire was made
by piling vp dead bodies,
dragg'd thither from all about,
and fastned together
with speares and iauelins.
An abominable spectacle euen
among the barbarous.

But Pompeis sonnes despairing,
in truth, of victorie,
Cnaeus Pompeius flying out
of the battell, and, wounded,
as he was, in the legge,
seeking to saue himselfe in
the desarts, and vnfrequented
places, was ouertaken
at the towne Lauro, and
there (so little he as yet despaired)
was slaine by Pesennius
who had him in
chase. Meanewhile, fortune
hid Sextus Pompeius
safe in Celtiberia, reserued
for other warres after Caesars
death. Caesar returnes
victorious home: the pomp
of his first triumph was
furnished from the Rhene,
and Rhone, and with the
image of the captiue Ocean
                     
in gold. The stuffe of the
second was bay-tree of
Aegypt; and, for shewes,
the images of Nile and Arsinoe,
and of the watchtowre
Pharus, as it burnt
in the top like a flaming beacon.
The third was the
chariot of Pharnaces, and
the spoyles of Pontus. The
fourth represented king Iuba
and his Moores &amp; Spaine
twice conquered. Pharsalia,
Thapsus, and Munda (those
greater arguments, &amp; matters
then ouer which hee
triumpht) were not mentioned.
Here, for a while,
were weapons layd aside,
the following calme without
bloud, and the cruelties
of warre were made amends

for with goodnesse:
not a man put to death by
commandement, except
Afranius, (for whom once
pardoning was enough)
and Faustus Sylla, because
Caesar had learnd to feare
him for his father in law,
and Pompeis daughter,
with her vncles by Sylla's
side: in this hee tooke care
to make posteritie secure.
His countrey therefore not
ingratefull, all sorts of honours
were heaped vpon
this one prime man; images
about the temples; in
the theater a crowne deckt
with rayes; a chaire of state
in the Senate-house; a pinacle
vpon his house top; a
month in the Zodiac; and

besides all these, himselfe
proclaimed Father of his
countrey, and perpetuall
Dictator: last of all (and it
was unknowne whether it
were with his good liking)
Antonius, Consull, the ornaments
of a king were
offred: all which prooued
but as ribbands, or trimmings
of an host ordained
to be slaine in sacrifice. For
the mildnesse of this prince
was lookt vpon with enuious
eyes, and the power it
selfe, which conferred benefits,
was to free mindes
cumbersome. Nor was the
forbearance of him an acquitall
any longer: for Brutus,
and Cassius, and other
Patricians, Lords of the

highest ranke, conspired to
assassinate him. How great
is the force of fate! the conspiracy
was knowne far abroade;
a scroll was giuen
also to Caesar himselfe, vpon
the very day of the fact; &amp;
though an hundred beasts
were sacrificed, yet not one
of them had any signe of
luckines. He came into the
Senate-house with a meaning
to aduance a warre against
the Parthians: there
the Senators stabd at him,
as he sat in his court-chair, &amp;
with twenty three wounds
he was driuē to the ground.
So, he who had embrewed
the whole earth with ciuill
bloud, did with his owne
bloud ouerflow the Senat-house.

                        CAesar, and Pompey
slaine, the people of
Rome seem'd to
haue returned to the state of
their ancient libertie, and
had returned indeed, if Pompey
had left no children,
nor Caesar an heire; or,
which was more pestilent
then both, if once his fellow
in office, and then his
riuall in honour, that firebrand
of Caesars power, and
whirlewind of the ensuing
age, Antonius, had not ouer-liued.
For, while Sextus
Pompeius seekes to recouer
his fathers estate, no

part of the sea was free
from feare of him; while
Octauius reuengeth his fathers
bloud, Thessalia was
againe to be stirred: while
Antonius, variable-witted,
either disdained that Octauius
should succeed to Caesar,
or for loue to Cleopatra,
takes vpon him to bee a
king: for hee had no other
way to be safe, but by turning
vassall. In so great
preturbation we are to bee
glad notwithstanding, that
the whole power of Rome
came to be setled vpon Octauius,
first Caesar Augustus,
who by his wisedome, and
dexteritie reduced into order
the body of the empire,
shaken, and distempted on

all sides, which without all
doubt could neuer haue
been brought together, and
made to agree, vnlesse it
had beene gouernd by the
authoritie of some worthie
one, as with a soule, or
mind. Marcus Antonius,
&amp; Publius Dolobella, Consuls,
fortune now busie in
transferring the empire to
the house of the Caesars, the
troubles of the citie were
various, and manifold: that
as in the change of yeerely
seasons, the stirred heauens
doe thunder, and signifie
their turnings by the weather;
so in the change of the
gouernmēt of the Romans,
that is to say, of all mankind,
the world troubled

throughout, and the whole
body of the empire was
turmoiled with all sorts of
perils, and with ciuill warrs
both at land, and sea.

                     THe first cause of ciuill
breach was Caesars
last will, and testament,
in which Antonius
being named but in the second
place, he grew starke
mad, that Octauius was preferred,
and for that cause
opposed the adoption of
that most spiritfull yongman
with an inexpiable
warre. For seeing him not

fully eighteene yeeres old,
tender, &amp; fit to be wrought
vpon, and open to abuse,
both defaced the dignitie
of Caesar's name with reuiling
termes, and diminisht
his inheritance with priuie
thefts, disgraced him with
foule phrases, and gaue not
ouer, by all the wayes hee
could inuēt, to impeach his
adoption into the Iulian family:
lastly, enterprised a
warre for ouer-bearing the
yong noble gentleman, and
with an armie, raised in Gall
on this side the Alpes, besieged
Decimus Brutus for
resisting his practices. Octauius
Caesar, pitied for his
youth, and wrongs, &amp; gracious
for the maiestie of

that name which hee assumed,
calling his adoptiue fathers
old souldiers to arms,
hee then a priuate person
(who would giue credit to
it?) sets vpon the Consull,
deliuers Brutus from siege,
and strips Antonius out of
his campe: at that time he
did nobly with his owne
hand: for bloudy, &amp; wounded
as hee was, hee carried
vpon his owne shoulders
the eagled ensigne into the
campe, which the eagle-bearer
deliuerd to him, dying
slaine.

                        ANtonius, of his owne
nature, troublesom
to peace, and troublesome
to commonweale,
Lepidus comes in like fire
to flame: because there was
a necessitie of entring into
the bond of a most bloudy
league against two armies.
The intentions of the boutefeus
were seuerall in kindling
these firie-blazes: Lepidus,
couetous of riches, the
hope whereof stood vpon
troubling the state, Antonius
desirous to be reuenged
vpon them, who proclaimed
him traitour, and Caesar

for the death of his adoptiue
father vpon Cassius, and
Brutus, offensiue to his vnreuenged
ghost. Vpon
these termes of as it were a
league,A. V. C. DCCXI. peace was established
among the three captaines,
and at Confluents
betweene Perusia, and Bononia
they ioyne hands, and
their armies embrace: so
the triumuirate is entred
vpon with no good fashion.
The common-weale
opprest with force, Sulla's
proscriptions returne, the
hideous crueltie whereof
containd no lesse then the
number of one hundred,
and fortie Senatours: the
ends of such as fledde for
their liues ouer all the

world, were gastly, foule,

                  The warre with CASSIVS:
and BRVTVS.
                  
                     
                        BRutus, and Cassius
seemed to haue
put by Iulius Caesar
from the tyrannie, as another
Tarquinius Superbus.
But common libertie, the
testitution whereof they
principally aimed at, was
lost by this assassinate of the
common Father. So soone
therefore as the fact was
committed, they fled out
of the Senate house, or Curia,
into the Capitoll, as fearing

                     Caesars old souldiers
not without cause, who
wanted not the minde to
take reuenge, but a captaine
for it. And when it now
appeared what destruction
hung ouer the state: the
murther was disliked, &amp; by
the Consuls consent a decree
of Obliuion was enacted:
yet to bee out of the eye of
the publike griefe, they departed
into Syria, and Macedonia,
prouinces giuen
them euen by Caesar himselfe,
whom they slew, reuenge
was rather deferred
then buried. The commonweale
therfore being setled
vpō 
                     the pleasure of the Triumuirs,
rather as it might
be, then as it were fit, and

                     Lepidus one of the three, left
at home for defence of
Rome, Caesar addresseth
himselfe, with Antonius against
Cassius and Brutus.
They hauing drawne huge
forces to an head, took the
selfe-same field which was
fatall to Cnaeus Pompeius,
where the tokens of their
destinated ouerthrow were
not obscure: for the birds
which vsed to gorge themselues
vpon carion, houerd
about the campe as if it
were already theirs, as they
marcht out to batel, a black
Moore meeting them, was
too too plainly a sign foreboding
dire successe: and to
Brutus himselfe at night,
when light beeing brought

in, he meditated somewhat,
as his maner was, all alone, a
certain gloomie Image appeared
to him, which being
by him demanded what it
was, I AM (it said) THINE
EVILL SPIRIT, and therewithall
vanished out of his
admiring sight. In Caesars
campe all presages were as
much for good, as they
were in the other for the
bad; birds, &amp; beasts promising
alike faire fortune: but
nothing was in presēt more
luckie, then that Caesars
physician was warnd in his
sleepe, that Caesar should
not stay in his own campe,
for that it would be surprised,
accordingly as it fel out.
For the battels ioyning, &amp;

the fight maintain'd on
both sides with equal manhood
for awhile, although
the Generals were not present,
the one withdrawne
through sicknesse of bodie,
and the other for sloth, and
feare; yet the vnvanquisht
fortune both of the reuenger,
and hee for whom the
reuenge was vndertaken,
stood for the side. The danger
was as doubtfull at first,
and as equal on both parts,
as the euent of the fight
declared: Caesars campe taken
heere, and Cassius his
campe there. But how much
more forceable is fortune
then vertue! and how true
is that speech in which hee
breathed out his last! THAT

VERTVE WAS ONLY A
VERBAL THING, AND
NOT A REAL, Meere mistaking
gaue away that battell:
for when Cassius, a
wing of his armies shrinking,
saw his owne troups of
horse gallop back vpon the
spurre, after they had taken
Caesars campe, supposing
they fled, got himselfe to an
hillocke; from whence not
being able to discern what
was done by reason of the
dust, noise, &amp; night at hād,
and when the scout whom
hee had emploid for discouerie,
staid somewhat long
before he returnd, he verily
thought the day was lost;
and thereupon caused one
of them who was next him,

to strike off his head. Brutus,
when he had in Cassius,
lost his own life also, not to
breake in any point that
faith which each of them
had plighted to the other,
for otherwise they meant
not to ouer-liue the battel,
laid his side open to the
deadly blow of one of his
owne companions. Who
would not wonder that
those most wise men vsed
not their own hands at their
last? vnlesse in this point also
they had a ioynt perswasion,
not to distaine their
hands, but in letting out
their most pure, and pious
soules they meant the direction
should be theirs, but
the heinous executiō other
mens.

such lands as Caesar
diuided in
campe among the old souldiers

raised another war. Lucius
Antonius, who was alwaies
in his owne nature a most
wicked man, was stirred vp
the more by Fuluia his
wife, a virago, who had
serued in the warres like a
man. Therefore by encouraging
such as were disseised
of their tenements,
there was going to armes
againe. In this case, Caesar
sets vpon him, not vpon

his owne head, or opinion,
but as vpon a person whō
all the Senate sentenced an
enemy: &amp; shutting him vp
within the walls of Perusia,
compelled him to the extremest
termes of yeelding,
by such a famine as
had left no filthie thing
vnfed vpon.

                     THe killers of Iulius
Caesar being made
away all,A. V. C. DCCXVII. there only
now remained Pompeis
house. One of the brothers
fell in Spaine, the

other saued himselfe by
flying, who assembling the
scatter'd remaines of that
vnfortunate warre, and arming
moreouer, to his ayde,
the sturdy bodies in the
worke-iails, or bride-wells
euery-where, held Sicily,
and Sardinia. And now
his nauie wafted vp, and
downe in the middle of
the sea. O how differently
from his father! hee
rooted out the Cilicians,
but this man stirred pyrats
to take his part. It
was so mightie a piece of
martiall worke to master,
and vtterly to distresse
him in the straights
of Sicilie, that he had carried
with him to his graue

the reputation of a gallant
commaunder in the
warre, had hee attempted
nothing after that,
but (which is an argument
of a noble minde)
TO HOPE ALVVAYES.
For his powers
quite defeated, hee
fled, and sail'd into Asia,
where hee was to fall into
the hands of his enemies,
and be cast into fetters,
and (which of all other
things doth most afflict
an heroicke spirit)
to die by an executioner,
at the pleasure of a foe.
There was no flight since
that of Xerxes more miserable.
For he who late
was Lord of three hundred,

and fiftie shippes of
warre, escaped away with
onely sixe, or seuen of them,
putting out the light in
the admirall, throwing
his rings into the waues,
quaking, and euer looking
backe, and yet not fearing
lest hee should perish.
Though in Cassius, and
Brutus, Caesar had ridded
the power of the faction
out of the world, and in
Pompey had abolished the
whole name, and title of
it, yet could not hee settle
a sound peace, while
Antonius the rocke, the
knot, and the common
let of assured quiet, was
aliue, and there was no
want in him why vices

made not an end of him:
nay his pride, and riot hauing
made triall of all
things, hee first ouercame
enemies, then citizens, and
lastly the times with the
terrour hee had raised of
himselfe.

                  The warre with the Parthians
by Generall VENTIDIVS.
                  
                     THe miserable ouerthrow
of Crassus
made the Parthians
higher crested, and
they were glad to heare
the newes of the ciuill
warres of Rome. So soone

therefore as any occasion
glimmer'd out, they
stuck not to breake in vpon
vs, Labienus euen inuiting
them, who employed
by Cassius, and
Brutus, dealt with the enemie
(O the madnesse of
wickedesse!) for their
assistance, who therevpon
chase away the garrisons
of Antonius, ledde on
by the gallant young king
Pacôrus. Saxa, deputie
of Antonius, obtained of
his owne sword to keepe
him out of their fingers.
After Syria was wonne
away, the mischiefe had
crept farther, the enemie,
vndercolour of
giuing ayde, conquering

for himselfe, had not Ventidius
(who also was Antonius
his deputie) with
incredible good fortune,
both defeated the forces
of Labienus, slaine Pacôrus
himselfe, and followed
in execution vpon all the
cauallerie of Parthia, ouer
the whole space of countrey
betweene the riuers
Orontes, and Euphrates.
The slaine, were aboue
twentie thousand, as Ventidius
handled the matter.
For counterfeiting
a feare, hee suffered the
enemie to come vp so
close to his campe, that
they wanted roome
to plie their shotte
of arrowes. The king

himselfe most valiantly
fighting was killed, and
his head carryed about,
and shewed to all the reuolted
cities. Syria was
thus recouered without
warre, and so, by the
slaughter of Pacôrus wee
were euen for Crassus ouerthrow.

with the Parthians.
                  
                     THE Parthians,
and Romans hauing
made tryall
each of other, Crassus, and
Pacôrus being lessons to

both sides of eithers forces,
league was made
againe with equall reuerence,
and entirenesse of
amitie, and that by Antonius
himselfe. But the
infinite vanitie of the man,
while hee coueted to adde
the conquest of Araxes,
and Euphrates to the titles
of his images, suddenly
leaues Syria, and inuades
the Parthian, without
anie either cause, or
wise counsell, or so much
as an imaginarie colour of
warre, as if so to steale-vpon
were also a part of
a captaines dutie. The
Parthians, besides affiance
in their peculiar weapons,
pretend likewise to bee

afraid, and flie into the
open fields. Hee forthwith
pursues them as victorious;
when, vpon a sudden,
though in no great
numbers, they burst out
neere twi-light at vnawares,
like a showre, vpon
the Romans now wearie
with trauaile, and with
their arrowes ouerwhelme
two legions. But this
was nothing, in comparison
of the calamitie which
hung ouer their heads the
verie next day, had not
the compassion of the
Gods come betweene.
One, whose life was spared
in Crassus his ouerthrowe,
comes ryding to
the trench, attired like a

                     Parthian, and hayling
them in Latin, after hee
had gotten to bee beleeued,
informes them what
was at hand, that the king
would come vpon them
with all the power of the
realme: that therefore they
should march back, and
recouer the mountaines;
though euen so perhaps
they should haue store of
enemies. By this meanes
a lesser force came against
them, then was in readinesse.
Yet they fell on,
and the remaines of the
armie had beene quite destroyed,
but that when
the Parthian shot flying as
thicke as haile, the souldiers,
taught wee know not

how, dropt on their knees,
and casting their targets
ouer their heads, seem'd as
if they had beene slaine,
then staid the Parthians
their bowes. whereupon the
Romans starting vp on their
feete againe, did againe
moue such wonder, as that
one of the barbarous vsed
this speech; Goe Romans,
and fare well; fame with
good cause termes you the
Conquerors of nations, who
can outstand the shot of Parthia.
Water afterwards did
no lesse mischiefe then the
armed enemie: first the
countrey was naturally
dry off-springs, then the
riuer Salmadicis was to
some more noyous then

the drouth, and last of all
when the weake dranke
deepe of the riuer, euen the
sweete waters also, proued
poisonous. Moreouer, the
heats of Armenia, and the
snowes of Cappadocïa, and
the sudden change of one
ayre into another, was itselfe
in stead of a plague. So
a third part of sixteene legions
hardly remayning,
when the siluer which hee
had in the armie was euerywhere
chipt with chisils,
and himselfe betweene the
fittes of the mutinie calld
euer, now and then to a
sword-player of his to kill
him, the doughtie Generall
fled at last into Syria:
where, like a man in a manner

besotted, hee became
somewhat more brag, and
loftie then before, as if he
who had brought himselfe
away, had gotten the victory.

                     THe furie of Antonie
which ambition
could not kill,A. V. C. DCCXXII.
was quencht with wanton
lust, and riot, for after
his Parthian iourny growing
into hatred with warre,
he gaue himselfe ouer to
rest, and surprised with the

loue of Queene Cleopatra,
solaced on her bosome, as
freely as if all other matters
had succeeded well.
This Egyptian woman did
value her companie at no
lesse a rate to Antonie drunken
with loue, then the
whole Roman empire. &amp; he
promised it: as if the Romans
were more easily to
be dealt with then the Parthians.
Therefore hee began
to plot a tyrannie, nor
that couertly, but forgetting
his countrey, his name,
his gowne, his fasces, hee
absolutely degenerated into
no lesse a monster in his
vnderstanding, then he did
in his affection, and fashion.
hee went with a staffe of

gold in his hand, a Persian
sword by his side, a purple
robe buttond with huge
precious stones; and a diadem
in readinesse. that a
king might inioy a Queene.
At the first bruite of these
stirres, Caesar crosseth ouer
from Brundisium, that hee
might giue warre the meeting;
and, pitching his tents
in Epirus, did beset the
iland Leucades, and the
rocke Leucades, and the
points, or nesses of the Ambracian
bay, with his ships
of warre, wee had aboue
foure hundred saile; the
enemies not fewer then
two hundred, but what
they wanted in number,
was made vp in bulke: for

they had from sixe to nine
bankes of oares, besides
that, their fights were raised
so high with decks, and
turrets, as they resembled
castles, and cities, making
the very sea grone vnder, &amp;
the windes out of breath
to carry them: which hugenesse
of theirs was it selfe
their bane. Caesar's nauie
had not in it any vessell but
from three bankes of oares,
to sixe, and none aboue:
therefore they are yare, &amp;
ready for all the needes of
seruice, whether to charge,
recharge, or turne about.
those of the other side were
meere slugges, and vnwieldie
for all worke: vpon euery
of which many of

ours setting, and plying
them what with darts, and
all sorts of flingings, what
with beak-heads, or prows,
and castings of fire, scattred
them all at pleasure. nor
did the greatnesse of the
enemies preparations appeare
at any time more
then after the victorie: for
the huge armada, bulged, &amp;
split in the fight, was carryed
in the wracks thereof,
vp, and downe ouer the
whole sea, containing the
spoiles of Arabia, and Saba,
and of thousand other nations
of Asia, and the waues
stirred with the winds, did
daily belch vp gold, and
purple vpon the shores. the
first who led the way to

running away, was the
Queen, who in a galleon
whose poope was of gold,
and saile of purple, thrust
into the deepes, Antonius
forth-with following her:
but Caesar was at his heeles.
So that neither the preparations
which he had made
to fly into the Indian Ocean,
nor Paraetonium, and Pelusium,
the two corner coasts of
Aegypt, stuft by him with
garrisons, stood him in any
stead, all were so quickly
seized. Antonius was the
first of the two who slew
himselfe. the Queene kneeling
at the feete of Caesar,
laid baits for his eyes; but
in vaine; her beauties were
beneath that princes chastitie.

nor was life her suit▪ 
                     for
that was offered, but her
care was for a part of the
kingdome: which when she
despaired to obtaine of the
prince, and saw her selfe reserued
for triumph, the
guard put about her being
negligent, she betooke herselfe
to the Mausolie (so cal
they the sepulchres of their
kings) where attired in most
pompous habit, as her custome
was, shee seated herselfe
in a throne, sweetned
with rich perfumes, close
to her Lord Antonius, and
clapping serpents to her
veines, died away in a slumber.

                  Warres against foraine
nations.
                  
                     HEre ended the ciuill
wars. the rest were
against strangers,
who, while the empire was
turmoild with these intestiue
miseries, sallied out
against vs in diuers quarters
of the world. For peace
was but greene, and the
stif-swoln necks of nations,
not yet inured to the curbe
of seruitude, slipt the yoke
which had but newly beene
imposed. the climat which
is almost vnder the northpole,
bare it selfe more
roughly: the Noricks, Illyrians,

Pannonians, Dalmatians,
Mysians, Thracians, and
Dacians, Getes, and Sarmatians,
and Germans. The
Alps, and snow vpon them,
whither warre could not
climbe, gaue incouragement
to the Noricks. But
Caesar throughly quieted
all the nations of that
tract, the Brenns, Senons, &amp;
Vindelicians, by his son in
law whose mother hee had
married, Claudius Drusus.
How sauage those crafty
people were, appeared wel
enough by the women,
who for want of mischieuous
weapons, pasht their
sprawling babes on the
ground, and hurld them
in the souldiers faces, as

they came against them.
The Illyrians also liue vnder
the Alps, possesse the
vallies between, and guard
certaine passages, at it were
barres, themselues wrapt
in with abrupt water-falls.
Against them hee went in
person, commaunding
bridges to be made. Here
the waters, and enemies
empeaching him, as our
souldiers were slacke to
scale, hee rasht a target out
of one of their hands, and
led the way, the troupe
then following thick: but
the Illyrian hauing with
their multitude saw'd in
sunder the bridge, his
hands, and legges were
wounded in the fall; so the

bloud which dropt from
him, making him shew the
brauer, and his danger it
selfe the more maiesticall,
he assaild the enemy at the
back. The Pannonians are
wall'd in with two wilde forests,
and three great riuers,
Drauus, Sauus, and Ister,
and they, hauing first foraged
their next neighbours,
retired themselues
within their defences. For
taming these hee sent out
Vibius: who slue them on
either banke of their riuers.
The armours of the
vanquisht were not consumed
with fire, as the fashion
of warre was, but were
preserued, and throwne
into the streames, that the

newes of their fellowes ouerthrow
might so be conueighed
to the residue.
The Dalmatians, for the
most part, dwell close at
wood-sides, which makes
them wondrous forward
more then all other, to
commit robberies: Marcius,
by burning Delminium,
their principall citie,
had now as it were cut off
their head: Asinius Pollio
amerced them with the
losse of their cattell, armes,
and tillage: but Augustus
commanded Vibius to subdue
them vtterly: Who
made those fierce nations
digge in mines, and to refine
gold-oare, which they,
the most couetous men of

the world, doe search for
with careful diligence, that
they may seeme to hoord
it for their proper vses.
How wilde, and grimme
the Mysians be, and how
barbarous aboue all barbarisme,
is horrible to bee
spoken. One of their captaines
stepping out before
the armie, pray'd silence,
and said; Who are yee? answere
was made; We are
lords of the world. They
replide, Yee may well say so,
if you conquer vs: Marcus
Crassus, General, tooke the
word as a faire forebodeing.
The Mysians forthwith
offer-vp an horse before
their battalions, vowing
to sacrifice, and eat the

bowels of those captaines
of ours whom they should
kill. I may very well beleeue
the Gods heard their
speech: they could not
stand out the sounding of
a trumpet. Domitius, a
captaine, strooke no little
terrour into the barbarous,
himselfe a man of a barbarous
blunt wit, but which
did well enough among his
likes, who carrying, for
as it were his crest, a chafing-dish,
or little harth
vpon his helmet, and the
coales thereof kindling
with the motion of his body,
the flames seemed to
blaze as if his head were on
fire. Before them in time,
the most mightie people

of Thrace rebelled, who as
barbarous as they were,
yet were accustomed to
militarie ensignes, and discipline,
yea and to Roman
weapons also: but being
vtterly subdued by Piso,
they shewed their wood
rage in their very bondage
it selfe. For attempting to
gnaw their chaines in sunder
with their teeth, they
punisht their owne wildenesse.
The Dacians keepe
them to their mountaines,
till the yce haue knit both
the bankes of Danubius together;
and then as often
as it is hard frozen ouer,
they passe it, as vnder the
guidance of Cotiso their
king, and destroy the border-countreys.

                     Caesar Augustus
thought good to
make that practice too hot
for them, though it was a
most difficult matter to
come where they were.
Sending Lentulus therefore
against them, he draue
them beyond the farther
banke, and planted garrisons
on the hither. If Dacia
was not conquer'd then,
it was put by, and deferred.
The Sarmatians gallop,
and ride in champaine
fields: and it was held enough,
to command them
by the same Lentulus not
to approach Danubius.
They haue nothing but
snow, and thinne woods.
Their barbarousnesse is so

great, as they vnderstand
not what peace meanes.
Would Germany also had
not thought it so great a
matter to ouercome. It
was more basely lost, then
gloriously gained. But
Augustus, forsomuch as
he knew his father hauing
twice past ouer Rhene by
bridge, had sought warre
there in honour of his memorie,
he desired to make a
prouince of it: and it was
done, could the barbarous
aswell haue brookt our
vices, as obeyd our commands.
Drusus, sent into
those regions, first tamed
the Vsipetes, then ouer-ran
the Tencthers, &amp; the Catti.
For hee had trimm'd a certaine

high hillock in manner
of a trophea with the
most speciall spoils of the
Marcomanni. After that, he
inuaded these other most
puissant nations, the Cherusci,
Sueuians, &amp; Sicambrians
at once: who burning
twenty captains of ours, had
bound themselues by that
fact to maintaine warre against
vs, with so assured
hope of victory, that they
diuided the prey by bargaine
before-hand. The
Cherusci they would haue
the horse, for their share;
the Sueuians the gold,
and siluer; the Sicambrians
the prisoners. But all
went quite backward on
their sides. For Drusus
                     
preuailing, did share, and
sell their horses, cattel, and
chaines of gold, and themselues,
as lawfull prize.
Moreouer, hee left garrisons
euery-where behinde
him, and guards for defence
of the prouinces. Vpon the
riuer of Mose, of Albis, of
Visurgis, and the banke of
Rhene, hee planted aboue
fiftie castels. Hee ioyn'd
Bonna, and Gelduba together
with bridges, and
strengthened them with
shipping. Hee opened the
Hercinian wood, till that
time pathlesse, and vnseene.
To conclude, such
was the peace in Germany,
that the men seemed not
the same men, the soile seemed

other then it had bin,
and the ayre it selfe more
milde, and temperate then
euer. And that most gallant
yong gentleman (I call him
not so, out of flatterie, but
as he well deserued) dying
there, the Senate, which it
neuer had done to any other,
surnamed him of Germanie,
Germanicus. But it
is more difficult to keepe
a prouince, then to conquer
it. Prouinces are atchieued
by the sword, but
retayned by iustice. Therfore
that reioycement was
short. For the Germans
were rather ouercome
then tamed, and vnder
Generall Drusus they rather
admitted our customs,

then submitted to our forces.
When hee was once
dead, they beganne to hate
the lawlesse humour, and
pride of Quintilius Varus
no otherwise, then as they
would haue hated crueltie.
But hee durst set
vp a Law-Court, and
sit in iudgement within
his campe, as if hee had
beene able to restraine
the violence of the barbarous,
with his serieants
roddes, and cryers voice.
But they, who now a
good while since had seene
their blades canker'd with
rust, and their horse of
seruice growne foggie
with ease, no sooner saw
our gownes, and lawes

more cruell then our
weapons, but they make
Arminius captaine, and
fall to armes. When Varus,
in the meane space, was
so aduenturous vpon trust
of peace, as hee tooke
no heed at all, though the
conspiracie of the captains
was foretold, and disclosed
to him by Segestes, a
prince among them. Therfore
(O strange securenes!)
as hee sat vpon the tribunal,
citing parties, they
at vnawares assaile him
on all hands, taken absolutely
vnprouided, and
fearing no such matter,
sacke his campe, and
destroy three legions. Varus
followed the vtter

losse of things there, with
the same fate, and minde
that Paulus Aemilius did
the deadly blow at Cannae.
Nothing was more bloudie
then the slaughter
which was made through
the woods, and marshes;
nothing more intolerable
then the insultings of the
barbarous, specially against
pleaders at the bar, plucking
out the eyes of some,
and lopping-off the hands
of other some; one had
his mouth stitcht-vp, after
his tongue was first
cut out, which the sauage
actor grasping in his
hand, sayd to it: Thou
viper, at last giue ouer hizzing.
The body of the

Consul himself, which the
souldiers had in their pietie
buried, was digged out
of his graue. The barbarous
doe as yet withhold
two of our ensignes, &amp; two
of our eagles; the third
the eagle-bearer plucking
off, before the enemies layd
hand vpon him, and carrying
it hidden in the hollow
of his belt, was plunged so
into the bloudy marsh. By
this ouerthrow it came to
passe, that the course of empire
which had not stopt at
the Ocean, stayd vpon the
banke of Rhene. These
things hapned north-ward.
In the South of the world
there were rather hurly-burlies
then war. The Musulanians,
                     
&amp; Gaetulians who
border vpon the Syrts, were
chastised by Cossus captain
generall, at Caesars commandement,
who was therfore
proper-named Gaetulicus.
The victory spreds wider.
Hee left the Marmarians,
&amp; Garamants for Furnius,
who subdued them: &amp;
might haue return'd entituled
Marmaricus, but that
his modesty rated not his
conquest so high. In the orient,
there was more to
doe with the Armenians.
Thither Caesar sent one
of his nephewes. Both
were of short life, and the
one of them inglorious.
For Lucius died of sicknes
at Massilia: Caius died

in Lycia of a wound, as he
recouerd Armenia, withdrawing
it selfe to the Parthians.
Pompey, hauing
vanquisht king Tigranes,
tide the Armenians to this
only poynt of bondage,
that they should haue no
gouernours but at our appointment.
This right of
ours, hitherto intermitted,
was reuiued by Caius, not
without bloudshed, and
yet without much bickering:
for Domnes, whom
the king had made gouernour
of Artaxat, faining
a reuolt, assailes him as he
was busie in perusing a
scroll, which himselfe had
reacht vnto him, pretending
it containd an account

of the treasures; and with
his drawne sword, runnes
him into the forehead. but
the Barbarian was tilted at
on all sides by the armie,
who being destroyd with
sword, and fire, into which
hee threw himselfe wounded,superstiti etiam non Caesari satisfecit.
satisfied Caius ouerliuing
him, but did not satisfie
Caesar. In the west
part of the world, all Spain
was at quiet, excepting that
quarter which abutting
close vpon the rocks where
the Pyrenaean mountaines
end, is washt with the hither
Ocean. Here, two most
puisant nations, the Cantabrians,
and Asturians liued
free from command. the
Cantabrians were the more

forward of the two, the
haughtier also, and stifer
in holding out a rebellion:
for not contented to
maintaine their owne freedome,
they sought to encroch
vpon their neighbours,
and wearied the
Vaccaeans, Curgonians, and
Autrigons, with often incursions.
against these men,
because they were said to
deale more outragiously
then ordinarie, Caesar commanded
not an expedition
to be made by any other, but
went in person: came himselfe
to Segisama; pitcheth
his camp; and from thence
euen then, diuiding his armie
into diuers parts,
hemd all Cantabria about,

and conquerd that wilde
nation, by inuironing them
as beasts within a toyle. nor
was the Ocean theirs: for
our army well-appointed
for warre, plaid vpon the
backs of the enemie. His
first battell against the Cantabrians
was vnder the
walls of Vellica. from
hence they fled into that
most steep high mountaine
Vindius, whither they beleeued
the waues of the Ocean
might as soone haue
clambred, as the Roman
armie. thirdly, the towne
Arracillum made great resistance,
but yet was taken
at the last. In the siege of
mount Edulius, about
which hee had drawne a

trench of fifteene miles in
compasse, the Romans
mounted on all sides: and
when the barbarous saw
no possibilitie to escape,
their strife was who should
kill themselues first with
fire, and sword amidst their
feasts, or with poison, which
is commonly there scruzed
out of Tax-trees, and so
the greater part of them
deliuerd themselues from
that which seemd to them
captiuitie. Caesar had these
seruices done for him by
Antistius, Furnius, and Agrippa,
his deputies, while
himselfe wintred vpon the
sea-coasts of Tarracon. He
present in his owne person
at the doing, drew some

of the vanquished from
dwelling on the moūtains,
of some hee tooke hostages,
and of others he made
slaues, and sold them vnder
garlands. It seemed to
the Senate an action worthy
of laurell, and a chariot:
but Caesar was now at that
heighth, as he might contemne
to triumph. About
the same time the Asturians
came powring downe
from their mountaines in
an huge troupe, nor did
they stay their owne,vt barbari impares. (as the
barbarous are vnruly) but
pitching their campe by
the riuer Astura, and, diuiding
their force into three
armies, they prepared to
assaile three seueral camps

of the Romans all at a time.
the fight had beene doubtfull,
and bloudy, and had
made an end of both parts,
they comming then, as
they did, so strong, so suddenly,
and with such sound
deliberation, but that the
Brigaecins betrayd them,
by whom Carisius hauing
intelligence, he came vpon
them with an armie, and
destroyd their deuice, neuerthelesse,
the battell euen
so was not vnbloudy,
such as remained vnflaine
of that most puisant assembly,
retired themselues into
the citie Lancia: where
the fight was so sharpe and
hot, that when our souldiers
demanded leaue to set

fire on the citie after it was
taken, the Generall could
hardly obtaine the fauour
at their hands, that it
might rather bee a moniment
of the Roman victory,
standing, then burnt to
the ground. This was the
last warre of Augustus
Caesar, and the last rebellion
of Spaine. Constant allegiance,
and eternall peace
forthwith ensued, aswell
by reason of their owne
inclination more bent to
peace, as by Caesars courses,
who fearing the boldnesse
which mountaines
bred in them, commanded
them to inhabit from
thenceforth in those camps
of his which were vpon

plaine ground. This began
to bee found a matter
of high wisdome. The region
round about was naturally
full of gold-oare, of
vermilion, orpiment, and
other colours. Hee therefore
commanded the groūd
should bee searcht, and
wrought. For while the
Asturians digged their
owne treasures, and riches
which lay deepe hidden, to
serue others turnes, themselues
also began to vnderstand
their value. All the
West; and South of the
world being at peace, and
Northward also (excepting
onely the Rhene, and Dababius)
as likewise in the
East, betweene Taurus,
                     
and Euphrates, those other
countreys who were free
from our power, had a feeling
notwithstanding how
great it was, &amp; reuerenced
the people of Romes victorie
ouer nations. For both
the Scythians sent their
ambassadours, and the Sarmatians
also, desiring
friendship. The Seres
moreouer, and the Indians
inhabiting right vnder the
Sunne it selfe, came with
precious stones, and pearls,
and dragging elephants also
along after them among
their presents, thought
not so much of any thing
as of the length of the
way, which tooke vp foure
yeeres trauell: and the very
                     
colour it selfe of the men
spake for them, that they
came from vnder as it were
another Sunne. The Parthians
in like sort, as if they
repented their victorie, restored
of their owne accord
the ensignes taken at
the destruction of Crassus.
So all mankinde had euery-where
an entire, and
continuall either peace, or
paction. And Caesar Augustus
seuen hundred
yeeres from after the building
of Rome, durst shut
the Temple of doublefaced
Ianus; twice onely
clozed before that time;
once vnder king Numa, and
the other time when the
first warre of Carthage was

concluded. From henceforth,
bending his minde
to peace, hee corrected many
things in the times
which were prone to all
mischiefe, and which ouerflowed
in riotous loosenesse,
with graue, and seuere
edicts. For these so
many, and so wondrous
great deeds of his, hee was
called perpetual Dictator,
and Father of his Countrey.
It was also debated in the
Senate, whether, because
hee had founded the empire,
hee should bee styled
Romulus. But the name
Augustus seemed to bee a
more holy, and venerable
word then the other, that
so euen now while hee

liued on the earth, hee
might bee as it were deifide
by the name it
selfe, and title.
