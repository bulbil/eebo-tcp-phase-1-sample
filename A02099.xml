            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            TO THE HONORABLE MINDED GENTLEMAN, Robert Carey, Esquire: Robert Greene wisheth as many good fortunes as the honor of his thoughts doe merite.
            
            
               HAuing waded (noble minded Courtier) through the censures of many both Honourable and worshipfull, in cōmitting the credite of my bookes to their honourable opinions, as I haue found some of them not onely honourably to patronize my workes, but curteouslie to passe ouer my vnskilfull presumption with silence, so generally I am indebted to all Gentlemen that with fauors haue ouerslipt my follies: Follies I tearme them, because their subiects haue bene superficiall, and their intents amorous, yet mixed with such morrall principles, that the precepts of vertue seemed to craue pardon for all

those vaine opinions loue set downe in hir periods. Seeing then (worthie Maecen

                ofletters) my workes haue beene counted follies, and follies the fruit of youth, many yeeres hauing bitten me with experience, and age growing on bidding mee Petere grauiora, to satisfie the hope of my friends, and to make the worlde priuie to my priuate resolution, I haue made a booke called my Farewell to Follies: wherein as I renounce loue for a foole, and vanitie as a vaine too vnfit for a Gentleman, so I discouer the generall abuses that are ingrafted in the mindes of Courtiers and schollers, with a Colling Card of counsell, suppressing those actions that straie from the golden meane of vertue. But (right worshipfull) some are so peremptorie in their opinions, that if Diogenes stirre his stumpes, they will saie, it is to mocke dancers, not to be want on, that if the fox preach, tis to spie which is the fattest goose, not to be a ghost ly father, that if Greene write his Farewell to Follie, tis to blind the world with follie, the more to shadow his owne follie. My reply to these thought searchers is this, I cannot

But omitting these digressions (right worshipful) to my book, which as it is the farewell to my follies, so it is the last I meane euer to publish of such superficiall labours, which I haue aduentured to shroude vnder the shelter of your worshippes patronage, as vnder his wing, whose generall loue bought with honorable deserts, may defend it from the iniurie of euerie enuious enemie.

hope then your selfe, I set downe my rest, and ventured boldly on your worships fauour, which if as I haue found before, I obtaine now, I shall thinke my selfe as fortunate in getting so honorable a patrone for my new indeuours, as vnhappie for blemishing my forepassed youth with such friuolous labours. And thus hoping my honest resolution to do well, shal be countenanst with your worships curteous acceptance, I commit you to the Almightic.

Florence, a citie greatly molested with this ciuill controuersie, in sted of palmes that presented peace, was stored with armour that denounced warres, the stréets that were a mart for the trafficke of merchants, serued for a place wherein to martiall souldiers, the Senate went not in roabes of purple to challenge reuerence, but in coates of stéele to maintaine their safetie: age, honour nor religion bar

These thus associated both in nature and nourture, accompanied the olde Countie to his house, where arryuing they found a Grange place by scituation melancholie, as seated in the middest of a thicket, fitter for one giuen to metaphusial contemplation than for such yong Gentlemen, as desired sooner to daunce with Uenus, than to dreame with Saturne, whose thoughts aimed not at the stoicke content of Pythagoras, but at an exteriour conceite of honest pleasure, which contrarie to their expectation in such a centurie or Countrie cottage,

they founde for Ieronimo Farneze, séeing the picture of discontent shadowed in their foreheads, conceiuing this frowarde humour to come, for that the place of their abode was so solempnely seated, beganne at the enteraunce into the base Court to vse these words.

being done, counting it Phisicke to sit a while, the olds Countesse spying on the finger of seignior Cosimo a ring with a deaths head ingrauen, circled with this posie, Gressus ad vitam, demanded whether hee adorde the signet for profit or pleasure, seignior Cosimo speaking in truth as his conscience wild him, tolde her that it was a fauour which a Gentlewoman had bestowed vpon him, and that onely he wore it for her sake. Then, quoth the countesse, tis a whetstone to sharp fancie: if it be madam quoth Cosimo, I am not so olde but I may loue: nor so young sir, quoth shee, but you may learne by that to leaue such folly as loue: no doubt nature works nothing vaine, the Lapidarie cuts not a stone, but it hath some vertue: men weare not iems only to please the sight, but to be defensiues by their secret operatiōs against perils, &amp; so seignior Cosimo wold I haue you vse the gentlewomans fauour, not for a whetstone to further folly, but for a cooling card to inordinate vanities. Themistocles wore in his shield the picture of a storke, his motto Antipelargein, for that he would not be stained with ingratitude. Socrates had but one toie in his house, and that wos the counterfait of patience, for that he had a shrew to his wife: By your leaue madame (quoth Cosimo) had not Socrates coūterfait also a sentēce: yes answered Farneze, but my wife plaies like the Priest that at his Eleuatio left out his Memento, the motto was this, Neque haec sufficit, meaning patience was as good a medicine to cure a waspish woman of sullenes, as an ants egge in sirop for him that is troubled with the Sciatica.

            I cannot denie madame, but you say well, yet your censure is a little too peremptorie, neither can I gainsay but such a resolution would do well in age, whose sappe shronke from y• branches, cōforts the water, but affoords no blossoms, your hairs being siluer had a sōmons vnto death, &amp; therefore to be armed with deuotion, our yeres growen &amp; budding forth a restles desire to plesure, which if we should cut off with a continuall remembrance of death, we shuld preuent time &amp; metamorphose our selues by conceit into a contrary shape: the Astronomer by long staring at the stars forgets the globe at his féet, so feareful was Phaeton of the signe in the zodiaock, that he forgat his course: &amp; so would you haue the delight of youth dasht with the sight of a death head, y• laying aside al recreation, we should fall to be flat Saturnists.

Messieur Benedetto interrupted the countesse, as one amongst al the companie most giuen to follie, for he was a fine courtier and was thus quicke in his replie.

Pride ouerthrew the pompe of Alexander, and had not pride hatched ambition the Romanes had neuer bewailde the death of Pompey, to repeat a catalogue of infinit examples were friuolous: and therefore leauing this generall discouerie let vs come to a more particular discourse of this follie. Our Florentins which professe themselues to be souldiers, are wedded to this vaine, as men shadowing the verie substance of pride with the two colours of same and honour: for what attempts they séeke to atchieue by martiall prowesse, what exploites they perfourme in warres, what daies and nightes they spende in watching either to preuent or preiudice the enemie, still claime the finall cause of those actions to be fame or honour. But who heareth the sundry and seuerall brauados our martialistes make of their strange encounters? how cunningly they ordred their squadrons? how couragiously they incountered the enemie? how stoutly they assaied the push of the pike? how strongly they bare the shocke of the horsse? what lances they brake? what massacres they made? what stratagemes they perfourmed? what cities they both assaulted and sacked, shall finde this report to tast of selfe lo

Seignior Farneze and the rest smiled at the sharpe reply of Bernardino, and among the rest messieur Benedetto galled peratio with this gléeke. By my faith gentlemen seignior Bernardino in my opinion hath done well not onely in his defence of a souldier, but in his Satyricall inuectiue against schollers, wresting argumentum coniunctum against Peratio him selfe: I hope sir you

are a batcheler, and therefore this kinde of phrase giues the lesse offence. peratio thought to push him with the pike, as hee had hit him with the launce, resembling the fall of Hector, who while he vnarmde Patroclus was vnhorsed himselfe: Peratio somewhat cholerike &amp; not well able to brooke the frump of Benedetto, was thus rough with him: masse courtier I am glad you keepe so good a decorum, as to let the lightnes of your head &amp; lauishnes of your follies so well to agree in eode tertio: you take Bernardinos part, but when the gentleman ran so mery a descant on the pride of schollers, had he by hap but glancst at the gaudinesse of your apparell, he had spoken farre more reuerently of scholters than he did: for you Florentine Courtiers, nay to be flat, we Florentine Gentlemen, to bring my selfe within the same predicament, discouer our selues to be the verie anatomies of pride: for he that marketh our follies in being passing humorous for the choise of apparell, shall finde Ouids confused chaos to affoorde a multitude of defused inuentions.

The begger Irus that hanted the pallace of Penelope, would take his ease in his Inne as well as the péeres of Ithaca. Thoughts are not measured by exteriour effects, but by inwarde affectes. Koabes made not Agathocles leaue to drinke in earthen vessels, but ragges shrowded a proude mind in Eubulus, that presumd to call him the sonne of a potter: tis as bad a consequent to call a king proud for his treasure, as a begger humble for his want, and therefore in my opinion, from the

the starres in his natiuitie had conspired to make him fortunate. By parentage royally and rightly discended from the ancient kings of Hungaria by birth sole king and monarch of all the Transalpine regions, nature had so curiously performed his charge in the lineaments of his bodie, &amp; the planets by happie aspects so carefully inriched his mind with sundrie gifts: as it was in question which of all these might chalenge by right the supremacie. But as the purest christall hath his strakes, the cléerest s kie his cloudes, the finest die his staine: so Vadislaus amidst all these golden legacies bequeathed to him by nature, Fortune and the gods, had yet a blemish darkened all his other glories with disgrace. For his minde was

But in the blossoms of his youth, when selfe loue tickled him forwarde to ouerweene of his owne estate: consideration, the enemie to vntimely attempts, had not trode on his héele, but taking the raines of libertie in his handes, he ranne with Phaeton headlong into his owne misfortune. For on a day, as oft he desired to delight his senses with the fragrant verdure of the meades, intending to be solitarie, for he hated disport, in that he scorned any of his nobility shoulde beare him companie, he passed secretly out at a posterne gate, onely accompanied with one of his nobles, whom amongst all the rest he admitted into priuat familiaritie: an Earle he was, and called Selydes, and went to a groue hard adioyning to the pallace, where in an arbour that nature, without the helpe of art, had most curiously wrought, he passed away parte of the day in melancholy meditation: at last tickled with a déepe conceit of his owne happinesse, commanding his noble man a part, he beganne thus to sooth him selfe in his owne follies. Hast thou not heard Vadislaus, nay doest thou not know, that kings are gods, and why gods, because they are kings, that a crowne contayneth a worlde of pleasures, and Fortune euer stoupeth at the sight of a sc

Why doest thou so muche abase thy selfe, kings are more than goddes, for Iupiter for all his Deitie was glad to reigne a pettie king in Créete, Saturne sued for the Diademe of Italie, both goddes, if Poets say true, and yet both inferiour vnto thée in crowne and kingdome.

At this he swelled and being droncke with the dregges of his owne folly, desirous to bée soothed in this imagination, be called vnto him the Countie Selydes, vnto whome hee vttered these wordes.

Alexander woulde bee called the sonne of Iupiter, but Calistenes made him denie such arrogancie in Babylon. Cresus was proude of his pelfe, but Solon pulde downe his plumes by preferring Byton before him in happinesse, kings heads are not impalled with fame, for that they are kings, but because they are vertuous.

After he was returned to the palace and was solitarie by him selfe, the Idea of hir perfection representing a humane shape of a heauenly creature, so assaulted his minde with sundry passions, that giuing the raines of libertie to his wanton appetites, he fell into these tearmes.

                  Quatuor his paenis Certo afficietur adulter,
                  Aut Egenus erit, Subita vel morte peribit,

Plato the prince of the Academickes, who for his sacred sentences with his maister Socrates, amongst all the Philosophers, challenged the name of diuine, had alwayes this saying in his mouth, that whatsoeuer excéedeth this word necessarie is superfluitie, which genus, he deuided into two especiall partes of apparell and fare: for the last whereof I am appointed to intreat, thus to the purpose. Those Gentlemen which build vpon the doctrine of the Epicures, and place their chiefe felicitie or summum bonum in the delicacie of fare, consider not that gluttonie is like to the Lymons in Arabia, which being passing swéete to the mouth, are inf
