            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               HAuing beene an Eare-witnesse
of that full satisfaction,
which vpon strict and long
Examination, your Highnesse
yeelded my Lords
Grace of Canterburie, and
my Lord of Bath and VVels, in the Grounds
and Principles of Christian Religion, I was encouraged
to adde forme and life to these ensuing
Obseruations, lately collected touching Confirmation,
that from thence your Highnesse might
not onely be informed how iustly the Church of
England, together with many other godly and
vsefull Ceremonies, retayneth this laudable and

auncient Custome, but farther be induced to the
receiuing of it with the greater cheerefulnesse in
your owne Person, assuring my selfe that your
Highnesse Example will serue to draw on many
Inferiours, eyther to take it more commonly and
willingly themselues, or at the least, to esteeme
it more reuerently in others. Now the God of
Heauen, who hath planted that Grace in you,
which to the great content and comfort of my
Soule, I perceiue to encrease daily, confirme it in
you, and you in it, to the glory of his Name, the
good of his Church, and the Saluation of your
owne Soule.
            
               Your Highnesse
Chaplaine, and Seruant,
in all humble dutie
to be commanded,

            THE
AVNCIENT
ECCLESIASTICALL
PRACTISE OF
Confirmation.
            
               CHAP. I.
               Of the Nature, and diuers Vses, of
Confirmation.
               1 CONFIRMATION
is an auncient Custome
of the Church, vsed after
Baptisme: consisting
in Examination, and
Imposition of hands,
with effectuall Prayer for the illumination
of Gods most holy Spirit, to confirme and

perfect that which the grace of the same
Spirit, hath already begunne in Baptisme.
               2 The benefits of this Confirmation
are diuers: whereof the first is, that men
expecting Examination, and tryall from
their Spir
                     â€¢
                  tuall Fathers, they might more
willingly acquaint, and carefully season
thems
                     â€¢
                  lues with the grounds of Christian
Religion, before Malice and corrupt Exa
                     â€¢
                  ples
depraued their mindes: as namely,
with the Articles of our Creede, vvhich
teach vs all wee are to beleeue: the Tenne
Commandements, which teach vs all wee
are to doe: the Lords Prayer, which teacheth
vs all wee are to aske, together with
the nature and vse of the two great Sacraments
of the Gospell, Baptisme alreadie receiued,
and the Eucharist to be receiued afterwards.
               3 Secondly, it serues that vvhen they
come to yeeres of discretion, they should
publiquely make confession of that Faith
themselues, which others had promised for

them in Baptisme, to the discharge of their
Sureties, and the good example of others.
               4 Thirdly, that by such Confession they
might make profession of difference from
all Iewes, Turkes, and Infidels, out of the
Church; Heretikes, Schismati
                     â€¢
                  es, and prophane
persons in the Church.
               5 Fourthly, that then specially, vvhen
they first come to the vse of reason, beginning
to fall into sundry kindes of sinne,
and being least able to resist, for want of experience,
by Imposition of Hands and
Prayer they might receiue strength and defence
against the temptations of the World,
the Flesh, and the Diuell.
               
               6 Fiftly, that the Prelates and chiefe
Guides of Gods Familie, to vvhom the
Cure of their Soules belongeth, finding
vpon Examination, some part of their
owne heauie burden discharged; might
from thence reape comfort in beholding
those faire foundations already laid, and
glorifie God, whose praise they sound in the
mouthes of Infants.
               
                  
7 This kinde of Confirmation (vvere
there no authoritie to countenance it) is
in my iudgement so vsefull in the Church
of God, that vpon good reason it might be
entertained among Christians: but for farther
confirmation of it vve are compassed
with a cloud of VVitnesses, and that so
plentifully, out of all Antiquitie, as it may
seeme a kinde of ambition, or lost labour,
to quote their Names; wherefore I vvill
onely alledge the soundest of those, vvho
since the Reformation of Religion, and
clearer light of the Gospell, in their seuerall
VVritings, haue approued, and highly
commended this auncient Custome.
               8 I will beginne with
                     Cap. de Confirm. Quare satis est pro ritu quodam Ecclesiastico seu Ceremonia sacramentali Confirmationem habere. 
                  Martin Luther,
who in his Booke of the Captiuitie of Babylon,
by which hee vnderstandeth the
Captiuitie of the true Church vnder the
Romish yoake, though hee allow not
CONFIRMATION as a Sacrament,
yet hee thinketh it passable as an Ecclesiasticall
Ceremonie, or Sacramentall complement.

be very auaileable to the instruction of
youth, and the edification of the whole
Church: and hauing set downe diuers good

Scripture, the practise of the Apostles, and

the Canons of Councils, as namely, that of
Laodicea and Arles.

                   Iohn Caluin in his fourth Booke of
Institutions, in the vpshot of the Chapter
of Confirmation, not onely commendeth
the auncient vse of it, but the abuse being
remoued, heartily wisheth it restored. And
because his authoritie is (not without desert)
of great waight, I will set downe his
very words as I finde them: Would to God
(saith hee) wee retained that Custome, which I
haue already declared to haue beene in vse
among the auncientâ€”, before that abortiue vizard
of a Sacrament was put vpon it. And a
little after, If this part of Discipline, were
now
                     â€¢
                  adayes in force, the slacknesse of many Parents
would be much quickned, who passe ouer
the institution (or instruction) of their Children,
as a businesse nothing pertayning to them;
which then without some publike disgrace, they
could not omit: besides, there would be lesse ignorance,
and more concord in Articles of Faith
among Christian people.

place affirmeth that the Primitiue
Church was taught it out of the VVord of

God. And Doctor Raynolds in the second
dayes Conference at Hampton-Court, howbeit
he tooke some exceptions against a supposed
difference betwixt the wordes of the
Communion-Booke, and the 25. Article
touching Confirmation, yet for ought I
finde, hee findeth no fault with the Rite it
selfe, as it is now enioyned in the Church
of England.Page 794. Nay, Mr. Cartwright himselfe,
in the first edition of his Admonition, confesseth
that the Confirmation of Children is
very auncient, and that it hath beene well
instituted.Page 197. Howbeit in another place, forgetting
himselfe, hee referres the originall of
it to the fained Decretall Epistles of the
Popes; vnderstanding thereby, as it seemes,
eyther Melchiades Epistle to the Bishops of
Spaine, or that of Fabianus to the Easterne
Bishops, or that of Iohn the 3. to the Bishops
of Germanie.
            
            
               
               CHAP. II.
               Touching Imposition of Hands in Confirmation.
               1 AMong those vvho allow
the vse and end of Confirmation,
as we haue in the
first Chapter vnfolded
it, there are n
                     â€¢
                  twithstanding
some, who eyther
out of Ignorance, or desire of Contradiction,
or too much nicenesse, except against
the Ceremonie of Imposition of hands vsed
in it, as sauouring of Poperie: others, against
the restrayning of it to the Administration
of Bishops, as a relique of Antichrist.
VVherefore, hauing cleared these two
points, I see no difficultie but that the most
tender in this case (were there no Ecclesiasticall
Iniunction to enforce it) might be

induced to the entertayning and embracing
of it, considering withall, that as vvee retaine
that which is due vnto it,See the 25. Article, and Rogers vpon it. so haue wee
abandoned from it that which latter ages
haue thrust vpon it, as vndue. First then of
Imposition of hands.
               2 The Hand is a member proper vnto
man alone, and is by Aristotle tearmed the
Instrument of Instruments, because it both
frames and directs them all: the vse of it
being no lesse diuers then needfull as well
in sacred and religious, as naturall and ciuill
Actions.
               3 But the most generall and notable vse
of the Hands in sacred actions, is the Imposition
of them, eyther for the blessing and
consecrating of them, on vvhom they are
laid, to God: or for the separating and ordayning
of them to roomes and offices of
diuine calling: or for the curing of their
diseases: or for reconciling of them to the
Church, after sufficient demonstration
made of their repentance: or lastly, for
confirming of them in that grace vvhich

they haue receiued in Baptisme, that as they
beleeue remission of sinnes vnto Iustification,
so they may be imboldened to make
open profession of this beliefe vnto Saluation.
               4 Now this vse of Imposition of hands
in solemne and sacred actions seemes to be
founded vpon Nature it selfe, since we find
it to haue beene vsed in the Consecration of

                     Liu. dec. 1. lib. 1. 
                  Numa, and that2 King. 5. 11. 
                  Naaman expected it from
Elizeus, for the curing of his Leprosie.
               5 Neyther was it peculiar to the Gentiles,
but more vsuall among the Iewes. Thus
when Israel blessed Ephraim and Manasses,
                  Gen. 48. 14.
                  Iosephs Sonnes, hee imposed vpon them his
Hands and prayed. Thus God commanded
Moses to dedicate Ioshua,
                  Numb. 27. 18â–ª
                   as his Successor, by
laying his hands on him. At the comming
of our Sauiour their suites that came vnto
him for helpe,Matth. 9. 18. were also tender
                     â€¢
                  d in such
formes of speech as shew that hee was himselfe
an obseruer of that Custome.Marc. 5. 23. And to
steppe one degree neerer to our purpose,
they brought vnto him little Children (saith the

Text) that hee should put his Hands o
                        â€¢
                     
them and pray:
                  Mat. 19. 13. and to manifest his Approbation
of it, hee controuled his Disciples
for rebuking them that came vnto
him.
               6 After the Ascention of our Lord and
Sauiour, that which hee had begunne vvas
practised by the Apostles, and hath beene
since continued in the Christian Church,
downe to this present time; nay, and in those
very Churches from vvhich it is banished,
it is againe

I throughly consider that of the Apostle,
in the 6. to the Hebrewes, of the fundamentall
Points of Christian Religion;
namely, of Repentance from dead Workes;
of Faith towards God; of the Doctrine of Baptismes,
and laying on of Hands; of the Resurrection
from the dead, and eternall Iudgement;
I cannot thinke of Confirmation, performed
by Imposition of Hands, but as of
a part of the Apostles Catechisme, since it

Repentance, of Faith, of the Resurrection, and
the last Iudgement, were proposed to such as
were not baptised till they arriued to yeeres
of discretion before their admittance to baptisme;
but to Infants baptised, at the time
of their Confirmation or Imposition of
Hands, when they came to the vse of reason;

Nay, this one passage (saith Caluin)
doth sufficiently testifie that the source and
head-spring of this Ceremonie flowed first
from the Apostles, it being instituted by
them as a solemne forme of Prayer, and an
argument of approuing that confession
which was made in Confirmation. So then
(saith hee) let vs remoue the Superstition, but
retaine the Institution: hauing shewed before
that this Superstition chiefly consisteth
in making it a Sacrament, and with-drawing
from the vertue and dignitie of Baptisme,
to magnifie and enrich it. And lest he
might seeme casually to let so much droppe

               8 Now I the rather presse these testimonies
of later VVriters, because I know there are
some, whose iudgements (not without reason)
are much swayed with their Authoritie:
and for the generall Concurrence of
antiquitie, I thinke among the learned there
is little question.

as much vpon record, not onely commending,
but commanding the vse of this Ceremonie
in their seuerall Acts.Cap. 8. And Tertullian
in his Booke of the resurrection of the flesh,
doth not so much aduise what should be
done in this case, as witnesse what the Catholike

Church did in his time:Caro manu

of Hands, that the Soule may be enlightened
with the Spirit of Grace: VVhich vvords
of his, seeming to ascribe too much to imposition
of Hands, giue mee leaue to
interprete, as Caluin doth Leo Bishop of
Rome, vnderstanding by the conferring
of the holy Spirit, Inuocation by earnest
and heartie Prayer, that it may be conferred
where it is not, and the Gifts and
effectuall Operation of it increased where
it is alreadie.

giuen through Imposition of Hands, for the
working of outward and sensible Miracles, as
heretofore it was, that so the strangenesse of
the Faith professed, might the sooner be entertayned;
and the narrow bounds of the
Church further enlarged: for who now expecteth,
that they on whom hands are laid for
the receiuing of the holy Ghost, should presently
beginne to speake with strange tongues? but
inuisibly the Loue of God is poured into their
hearts by the secret working of the Holy Ghost.

               CHAP. III.
               Of the restrayning of Confirmation to the
Order of Bishops.
               1 THat there should be an
Order consisting in distinct
degrees, and a subordination
of Offices, as
well in Ecclesiasticall; as
Ciuill Gouernment, the
common Practise of all Nations, Iewish,
Heathenish, Christian, and the voyce of
Nature and Reason, seeme to proclaime:
that disparitie which ariseth betweene the
Superiour and the Inferiour, being the
chiefest meanes of lincking and vniting
the seuerall parcels of the whole Societie,
in a mutuall correspondence, and reciprocall
proportion of Loue and Dutie. To this

purpose, that Bishops were superiour to other
Ministers, all Antiquitie with one consent
(if you except AiÃ«rius, who for dissenting
in this poynt, vvas accounted an
Heretique byHeres. 75. 
                  Epiphanius andHeres. 53. 
                  Augustine)
doth acknowledge; distinguishing three degrees
of Ministers: Bishops, Presbyters,
Deacons, answerable to the High Priest,
Priests, and Leuites among the Iewes.
               
                  Ignatius, who liued in the Apostles
times, often mentioneth this distinction, as
namely in his Epistle 
                     ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰

                        â€¢
                     yrnians:
Let the Lay-men (saith hee) be subiect to the
Deacons, the Deacons to the Presbyters, the
Presbyters to the Bishop, the Bishop to Christ.
And Saint Hierome (notwithstanding by
reason of his Controuersie with the Bishop
of Ierusalem, hee were held an aduersarie
to the state of Bishops) in his Epistle to Euagrius,
calleth it an Apostolicall Tradition,
That wee may know (saith hee) that the Apostolicall
Traditions are taken out of the olde Testament,
looke what Aaron, and his Sonnes,
and the Leuites, were in the Temple, the same

let the Bishops, Presbyters, and Deacons, challenge
in the Church. Now then as among the
Iewes, Aarons Sonnes iustly challenged
many prerogatiues aboue the Leuites, and
againe Aaron himselfe aboue his Sonnes:
so among Christians, doe the Presbyters
aboue the Deacons, and the Bishops aboue
the Presbyters; specially considering that
as the distinction of Presbyters and Bishops
was shadowed, vnder the Law, in Aaron and
his Sonnes, so vnder the Gospell is it established,
by referring their seuerall Succession
the one to the Apostles, the other to
the 70. Disciples. For that Bishops succeeded
in the roome of the Apostles, besides
many other testimonies, the Councill of

Marcella, touching the errours of Montanus.
               
               
                  
But lest I be here mistaken, as also for
the opening of a clearer passage to my
present purpose, giue mee leaue to vnfolde
my meaning in vvhat sence Byshops
most properly are said to succeede the Apostles.
For the better vnderstanding of which
Position, vvee must obserue, that the Apostles
transcendently comprehended in
their persons the vvhole Hierarchie of the
Church as now it is, and some-what aboue
them all: for first they were members of
the Church, as being Christians: secondly,
they were Presbyters, as being to preach
the Gospell and administer the Sacraments:
thirdly, they vvere Bishops, for iurisdiction
and imposition of Hands: fourthly, they
vvere Apostles, for the large circuit of their
Commission; for being called immediately
by Christ himselfe; for being furnished
with the infallible assurance of his truth,
and visible assistance of his Spirit, 
                     â€¢
                  n speaking
diuers tongues, curing diseases, working
Miracles, knowing secrets; and lastly,
not onely for receiuing the Holy Ghost

themselues in miraculous manner and measure,
but also for imparting it to others. In
this last regard, I meane for their Apostolique
charge, they left none to succeede
them: this calling being extraordinary, and
to endure but for a time, but the other three
were all ordinary, and consequently capable
of succession. In the first roome succeeded
them all that professe the Gospell: In
the second, all the Ministers of the Gospell:
In the third, the Bishops and Fathers of the
Church: so that by vertue of this Succession
the power of the Keyes, and Imposition
of Hands, properly belongeth to them.
Now that the Apostles alone imposed
hands, not onely in Ordination, but in
Confirmation, appeares out of the 8. of
the Acts, where when Phillip had baptised
the Samaritanes, it is said that the Apostles,
Peter and Iohn, came downe from Ierusalem,
to confirme them with Prayer and Imposition
of hands. Vpon which place Saint

                  Augustine affirmes the Church in his
time to haue obserued it, in suis praepositis, as
hee speaketh, in her Gouernours: the like
doth
                     Epist. 73. ad Iubaiaum.

                   Saint Cyprian witnesse of his times:
and
                     In vers. 2. Cap. 6. ad Heb. Impositionis manuum,] per quaÌ„ Spiritus sanctus accipi posse creditur, quod post Baptismum ad Confirmationem vnitatis inecclesia Christi Ã  Pontif

                   Saint Ambrose (being himselfe a Bishop)
(as also the former three) giueth a
reason for so doing, ad Confirmationem vnitatis:
I take his meaning to be, that the Bishops
by approuing, in Confirmation, that
which the inferiour Ministers had performed
in Baptisme, thereby established the
peace of the Church, as well by declaring
their vnitie among themselues, I meane of
the Bishops with the inferiour Ministers, as
also by exacting of such as vvere confirmed,
an vniformitie or harmonie of Confessions:
To this reason of Saint Ambrose,

                  Hierome, in his Dialogue against the
Luciferians, addes another of no lesse moment,
vvhich is, that the safetie of the

Church, depending vpon the authoritie of
Bishops for the shunning of Schismes, it
was requisite some eminent specialties of
power should be reserued, and annexed to
that place, as namely Imposition of hands,
which hee there affirmeth was the custome
of the Church, for the Bishop to performe
passing by the Country Parishes, thereby
blessing those vvhom the Presbyters and
Deacons had baptized.
               To these reasons of the holy Doctors
and Fathers may be added the vvaight of
Councels. The first Canon of the Councell
of Aurenge in France: and the 20. of the first
Councell held at Toledo in Spaine, to which
theIn. 4. dist. 7. Schoole-men andIn 1. dist. 95. Canonists generally
agree. Nay,Hic mos olim

                  Caluin himselfe in his Institutions
confesseth in expresse tearmes, that
the Minister of it was aunciently a Bishop.

                  Bucer in his Commentaries vpon the
Fourth to the Ephesians, Farther, thinkes it

to haue beene grounded vpon good reason.
And Doctor Raynolds in the second dayes
Conference at Hampton-Court, being challenged
by the Lord Bishop of Winchester,
where euer he had read that CONFIRMATION
was aunciently vsed by any other
then Bishops, by not encountring the challenge,
seemed to giue way vnto it.
               I will close vp this Chapter also vvith
those memorable wordes of Mr. Hooker in
the place before alledged: To pray for others,
is to blesse them for whom wee pray; because
prayer procureth the blessing of God vpon them,
especially the prayer of such as God eyther most
respecteth for their pietie and zeale that way; or
else regardeth for that their Place and Calling
bindeth them aboue others vnto
this dutie, as it doth both naturall
and spirituall
Fathers.
